The '''February 5<U+2013>6, 2010 North American blizzard''', commonly referred to as [[Snowmageddon]],<ref>http://www.nws.noaa.gov/os/presto/presto2010/2010feb.pdf</ref> was a Category 3 ("major") [[nor'easter]] and [[severe weather]] event.  The storm's center tracked from [[Baja California Sur]] on February 2nd, 2010 to the East coast on February 6, 2010, before heading east out into the Atlantic.  Effects were felt to the north and west of this track in northern Mexico, California, and the Southwestern, Midwestern, Southeastern, and most notably [[Mid-Atlantic States]].  Severe weather, including extensive flooding and landslides in Mexico, and historic snowfall totals in every one of the [[Mid-Atlantic states]], brought deaths to [[Mexico]], [[New Mexico]], [[Virginia]], [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Maryland]].<ref name="DCist">{{cite web|url=http://dcist.com/2010/02/comparative_snowpocalypse_analysis.php|title=Welcome to Comparative Snowpocalypse Analysis 101|date=2010-02-06|publisher=DCist|accessdate=8 February 2010}}</ref>

Most crippling was the widespread 20 to 35 in (50 to 90&nbsp;cm) of snow accumulated across southern [[Pennsylvania]], the [[Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia]], [[northern Virginia]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], and [[southern New Jersey]], bringing air and [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highway]] travel [[weather-related cancellation|to a halt]]. While rail service south and west of Washington, D.C. was suspended, rail travel between D.C. and Boston was available with limited service.<ref name="Reuters snowstorm">{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0614831920100206|title=Powerful snowstorm hits U.S. East Coast|authors=David Morgan and Eric Beech|date=2010-02-06|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref>  [[Blizzard]] conditions were reported in a relatively small area of [[Maryland]], but near-blizzard conditions occurred across much of the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic region]].<ref name="nwsblizzard">{{cite web|title=February 6, 2010 Blizzard Conditions|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/lwx/feb_6_2010_blizzard.php}}</ref>

This event was the second of four [[nor'easters]] during the 2009-2010 winter that brought heavy snow to enough of the Northeast's population to be numerically recognized by [[NOAA]]'s [[NESIS]] intensity rating.  The first and third of these systems, the [[December 2009 Nor'Easter]] and the [[February 9<U+2013>10, 2010 North American blizzard]], respectively, combined with this event to bring the snowiest winter on record to much of the Mid-Atlantic.  Additionally, this event was the second of three major Mid-Atlantic snowstorms that occurred over a 12-day period;  each subsequent storm focused its heaviest snow slightly farther north:  the January 30, 2010 storm (not recognized by NESIS) dropped more than a foot of snow across Virginia and the lower Chesapeake Bay region, while the [[February 9<U+2013>10, 2010 North American blizzard]] bulls-eyed the [[Mason-Dixon Line|Maryland-Pennsylvania]] border with as much as 38.3 inches.<ref>http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc5.html</ref>

==Formation and strengthening==
[[File:Eastcoast after early February 2010 blizzard.jpg|thumb|Snow-covered Mid-Atlantic region of the United States]]
The main storm system originated in the Pacific Ocean, bringing heavy rain and mountain snow to [[California]] and [[Arizona]] on February 2.  The storm center moved east through northern Mexico on February 3.  The system produced over one foot of snowfall in the higher elevations and the eastern plains of [[New Mexico]], shutting down major highways including [[Interstate 40]] east of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] for several hours on February 3.  The storm's center then advanced across [[Texas]] to the [[Louisiana]] Gulf Coast on February 4, while dropping rain and snow in [[Oklahoma]] and northern [[Texas]], and severe [[thunderstorm]]s further south.  Meanwhile a second, more-northern disturbance tracked from the central Rockies to the lower [[Missouri River Valley]], bringing light snow showers to [[Montana]], the [[Dakotas]], parts of [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Iowa]], and [[Illinois]].
[[File:Feb 7 2010 neusa snowfall.JPG|thumb|right|February 5<U+2013>6, 2010 North American blizzard Mid Atlantic Snowfall accumulation.(From the [[National Weather Service]])]]
On February 5, the two systems phased together, resulting in a band of heavy snow across [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Ohio]], and [[Pennsylvania]].  That evening, the northern system's energy was absorbed into the main southern circulation, promoting fast intensification.  Heavy snow subsequently developed over the [[Mid-Atlantic states]] as the storm's center tracked across [[North Carolina]] towards the Atlantic Coast.

[[File:NEXRAD 5 Feb 2010.png|thumb|right|[http://asl.umbc.edu/~schou/Feb2010/ NEXRAD Animation from 5 February 2010.]]]
An antecedent and nearly-stationary upper-level trough over the Maritime Provinces of Canada served to block the storm system from following the traditional northeast track into New England.  Instead, during the AM hours of February 6th, the storm center slowed its northeasterly movement as it continued to deepen east of Virginia Beach, before it eventually was forced eastward.  The blocking pattern was reflected on the storm's snowfall map by a sharp northern gradient in northern New Jersey and by the axis of heaviest snow running WNW-ESE through Maryland and Delaware (opposed to the SW-NE pattern found from most Nor'Easters).  Only moderate accumulations reached the southern suburbs of New York City, with no more than light snow falling in the city itself. [[Upstate New York]] and [[New England]] were spared from this system, receiving little more than isolated snow flurries in southern sections. Easterly winds and onshore flow contributed to light snow accumulations of less than one inch in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Cape Cod]], and parts of coastal [[Rhode Island]].

According to the blog of [[Weather Channel]] senior meteorologist [[Stu Ostro]], the storm formed from "Miller Type B" cyclogenesis:  a storm centered over the Ohio river runs into a blocking ridge and redevelops along the Carolina coast.  (This differed from the [[North American blizzard of 2009]], of "Miller Type A" cyclogenesis where a storm center develops over the eastern Gulf of Mexico and strengthens while tracking north to a latitude of greater temperature contrast.)  This storm was carrying an enormous amount of moisture drawn from both the [[Gulf of Mexico]] (as seen on February 3 satellite imagery over Mexico), and from the Atlantic (as seen in [[radar]] imagery from early on February 5).  Ostro characterized the storm as having "strong dynamics" and expected the snowfall to be of long duration, typically leading to large accumulations.<ref name="TWC Ostro">{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/blog/weather/8_21189.html|title=Early-mid February is going to do it *yet again*!|last=Ostro|first=Stu|date=2010-02-05|publisher=The Weather Channel|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref>

==Nicknames==
Media reports emphasized the magnitude of the storm, giving rise to many nicknames for it including '''Snowmageddon'''<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8505347.stm |title=BBC News - 'Snowmageddon' still gripping Washington and eastern US |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2010-02-08 | date=February 8, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2010/02/snowmageddon_obama_names_a_sto.html |title=Chicago Tribune - Obama names a storm |publisher=Chicagotribune.com |accessdate=2010-02-10}}</ref> and  '''Snowpocalypse'''.<ref name="DCist">{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5466475/snowmageddon-vs-snowpocalypse-which-cute-nickname-will-win|title=Snowmageddon vs. Snowpocalypse: Which Cute Nickname Will Win?|date=2010-02-08|publisher=Gawker.com|accessdate=8 February 2010}}</ref>

The ''Capital Weather Gang'' blog on ''[[The Washington Post]]'' website ran an online poll on February 4, 2010, asking for reader feedback prior to the blizzard,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitalweathergang/2010/02/poll_storm_nametwitter_hashtag.html|accessdate=February 11, 2010|title=Vote for storm name, Twitter hashtag & snow total|date=February 4, 2010|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]}}</ref> and several [[blog]]s, including the paper's own blog, followed that up by using either "Snowmageddon" and/or "Snowpocalypse" during the following days, before, during, and after the storm hit.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/06/us/06storm.html|accessdate=February 11, 2010|title=East Coast Is Hit by <U+2018>Potentially Epic Snowstorm<U+2019>|first1=John M.|last1=Broder|first2=Jack|last2=Healy|date=February 5, 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]|quote=bracing for what newspapers and bloggers have been calling the "snowpocalypse," or "snowmageddon,"}}</ref>

[[Pittsburgh#Climate|Pittsburgh]] with 21.1", was the first major city to experience the storm's heavier snowfall, separating sub-20" amounts over Indiana and Ohio from 20-35" readings found in the Laurel Highlands and east.  This was Pittsburgh's 4th greatest snow event since records began in 1871.  Areas south of Pittsburgh received up to 26" of snowfall. Although initially forecast to bring only 4-8" of snow to the area, the storm's track farther to the north lead to the explosive accumulations.  The National Weather Service in Pittsburgh office recorded 7" of snow over 700P-1159P February 5 and 5.3" over 300A-600A on February 6.

[[File:Snow in Pittsburgh 2010.JPG|thumb|right|In [[Pittsburgh]], over {{Convert|20|in|cm}} of snow fell causing numerous powerlines and tree branches to buckle.]]

The swath of heaviest snowfall then crossed the [[Appalachians]] and squeezed between [[Washington, D.C.#Climate|Washington, D.C.]] and [[Baltimore#Climate|Baltimore]].  The District of Columbia's totals were generally near 20", ranging from 18 to 28".  Baltimore City's totals were around 25", ranging from 21 to 28".  Dulles
[[File:1600 block of 19th Street, N.W. - 2010 blizzard.JPG|thumb|left|19th Street in Dupont Circle, [[Washington D.C.]], [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|Northwest]], where ~24" of snow had fallen on February 6th by day's end.]]
International Airport's 32.9" set all-time records (since 1962) for most 2-day and 3-day snowfall, shattering the old records from the [[Blizzard of 1996]] of 23.2" and 24.6", respectively.  Dulles received 17.5" on February 6, however, making the day's total only the 3rd greatest 24-hour snowfall amount.  Baltimore Washington International Airport, despite being near numerous 30"+ reports, saw a relatively tame 25".  This 2-day total was 2nd greatest (since 1892), behind 26.3" from the 1922 [[Knickerbocker Storm]].  Reagan National Airport's 17.8" was one of the metro region's lowest, but still ranked as Washington's 4th greatest (since 1871) in both 2-day and 3-day totals.

Additional local reports from Maryland include: Edgemere, 35.4"; Clarksville, 34.9"; Crofton, 34.0"; Columbia, 33.8"; Laurel, 32.9"; Pasadena, 31.0"; Dundalk, 30.5"; [[Ellicott City]], 30.2"; Frederick, 29.0";  Olney, 28.0"; Germantown, 27.4"; and [[Catonsville]], 22.9".

[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania#Climate|Philadelphia]]'s 28.5" ranked the storm as the city's 2nd greatest on record (since 1872), falling not far behind the [[Blizzard of 1996]]'s 30.7".  This made for Philadelphia's first winter with multiple 20"+ storms, following the 23.2" from the [[North American blizzard of 2009]].  Wilmington, DE's 25.8" was their greatest storm total of all-time (since 1894), passing the 1996 storm's 22".

Many counties, including the rural areas across the Appalachian mountains and Delmarva averaged over two feet of snow.

The storm was well spotted by the winter storm reconnaissance (WSR) program at National Center of Environmental Predictions (NCEP). Two aircraft missions were deployed over the Pacific regions on February 1, 2010. Accurate measurement in the cloudy regions were taken, the data were assimilated by the global forecast models in different numerical forecast prediction centers.

The [[WSR program]] is led by [[Dr. Yucheng Song]] from the [[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]] (NCEP).

==Impact==

===Mexico===
Freak winter rains across Mexico collapsed hillsides, sent rivers over their banks and left at least 15 people dead, officials said on Friday, February 5. The rain, which began early in the week and peaked on Thursday, February 4, had relented by Friday morning, providing officials with their first good look at the damage.

In the Dakotas a number of Indian Reservations were left without power or running water.

"There's been winters this bad before, but not with rain so bad it freezes the power lines and snaps the poles", said Joseph Brings Plenty, the 38-year old chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704094304575029450101290726.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Storm Takes Steep Toll on Destitute Tribe | first=Joel | last=Millman | date=January 28, 2010}}</ref>

Power outages began with a storm in December knocking down around 5,000 power poles, and was accelerated by an ice storm Jan. 22 knocking down another 3,000 power lines on the reservation.

Among the tribes of South Dakota who suffered from the multiple storms were [[Cheyenne River Sioux]], [[Crow Creek Sioux Tribe]], [[Flandreau-Santee Sioux Tribe]], [[Lower Brule Sioux Tribe]], [[Rosebud Sioux Tribe]], [[Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate]] and [[Standing Rock Sioux Tribe]].<ref>http://www.indiancountrytoday.com/national/plains/83646472.html</ref>

The [[United States Government]] implemented an unscheduled leave policy for federal employees on Friday February 5 and shut down four hours early in an effort to clear metropolitan Washington before substantial snow accumulations began. Numerous school districts in the metro DC area announced closures for Friday February 5 well in advance, although [[District of Columbia Public Schools]] and some Maryland schools held a half day of class. Many districts had used all their built-in snow days and some began scheduling classes on upcoming holidays (for example, [[Fairfax County]] on February 15, the Monday of [[President's Day]] weekend).<ref name="WashPost Halsey Weil">{{Citation |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/06/AR2010020600683.html |title=Snowstorm's intensity has D.C. region hunkering down |first=Ashley III |last=Halsey |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Martin |last2=Weil |newspaper=Washington Post |date=February 6, 2010}}.</ref> Late on Sunday February 7, the [[Office of Personnel Management]] announced that the [[United States Government]] would again be closed on Monday February 8, with only emergency/essential personnel required to report, and numerous school districts again canceled classes between February 9<U+2013>11.

Roadways were blanketed with snow, [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority|Metro]] bus service ended at 9&nbsp;pm EST, and above ground Metro rail service had also ended. Flights were canceled at the Washington-Baltimore area's three main airports and at [[Philadelphia International Airport]]. [[Delta Air Lines]] had suspended flights in and out of Washington, Baltimore, Maryland and Philadelphia.

In Maryland, the [[Maryland Transit Administration]] ran special snow trains on its heavy rail and light rail lines to keep tracks clear. [[Delaware]] Gov. [[Jack Markell]] declared a state of emergency Friday night and ordered all vehicles off the roads by 10&nbsp;p.m. EST (this was in addition to an earlier state of emergency declared by Virginia Gov.

In [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], both the impact and severity of the storm caught many by surprise.  Snow began falling in earnest late Friday morning.  The sudden onset of the storm forced many local school districts, especially districts south of the city, to close early due to rapidly deteriorating road conditions; this is an extremely uncommon event for schools in southwestern Pennsylvania.<ref>http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/news/22472114/detail.html</ref>  Nearly all schools, including the [[Pittsburgh Public Schools]], cancelled classes the following week.  Most local universities were also forced to cancel classes for much of the following week due to the storm's effects.  Additionally, over 130,000 people in the Pittsburgh area were without power as a result of the heavy, wet snow.<ref>http://kdka.com/local/power.outages.update.2.1475372.html</ref>  For many residents, power was not restored until Monday, February 15.

In New Jersey, the southern part of the state got hit with areas of 20+ inches of snow and some parts of the north got 0 to trace. Many reports of sleet and snow were coming in by the thousands in the state of NJ.
