The '''Miles M.9 Kestrel''' was a single engined tandem seat monoplane, designed as an advanced trainer.  Though only one Kestrel was built, it went into production as the [[Miles Master]] for the [[RAF]] in large numbers at the start of [[World War II]].


==Development==
Whether the Miles Kestrel<ref name="Lukins">{{Harvnb|Lukins|1945|pages=40-1}}</ref><ref name="Jackson">{{Harvnb|Jackson|1960|page=490}}</ref>  advanced trainer was named after a bird of prey like many aircraft designed by [[Frederick George Miles|F. G. Miles]], or after its [[Rolls Royce Kestrel|Kestrel]] engine is not recorded.  It was Miles' first high powered aircraft and was an aerodynamically clean monoplane with cantilever wings and tailplane.  The Kestrel had thick wings, perhaps influenced by the experiments with the [[Miles Hawcon]], with a root thickness to chord ratio of about 23%.  They had inverted gull form, with anhedral inboard giving way to dihedral on the outer part.  The wings carried ailerons immediately outboard of Miles split trailing edge flaps in two sections on each wing.  The main undercarriage was attached at the lowest point of the wing, keeping the legs short; they retracted backwards, with the wheels rotating into the plane of the wings.  A tail wheel was fitted.  Both rudder and elevators were horn balanced and fitted with trim tabs.  The aircraft was wooden throughout, with spruce frames covered in beech ply and a doped fabric sheath.<ref name="Lukins"/>

Instructor and pupil sat in tandem under a simple perspex canopy with the minimum of framing and with extra clear panels in the fuselage sides behind the rear seat.  The forward seat was positioned at about mid-chord.  The 745 hp (556 kW) Kestrel engine drove a three balded propeller and had a chin radiator under the nose.<ref name="Lukins"/>

The sole Kestrel, built as a private venture was registered (as ''G-AOEC'') in 1936<ref>[http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/HistoricalMaterial/G-AEOC.pdf  CAA ''G-AOEC'']</ref>  first flew in May 1937.<ref name="Jackson"/>  It appeared soon after at the [[Hendon Aerodrome|RAF Hendon display]] on 26 June.  Its performance was remarkable especially for a two seater; it reached 295 mph (475 km/h) at 14,000 ft (4,270 m), only 15 mph slower than the contemporary single seat Hurricane with its much more powerful engine.<ref name="Lukins"/>  The Kestrel, of course did not carry the same military load, though there was provision for a single 0.303 in (7.7 mm) [[Browning machine gun]] in the starboard wing outboard of the landing gear, and for a camera in the matching port side position.  There is no record that this gun was fitted.  There was also provision for eight practice bombs on two centre section racks.<ref name="Lukins"/>  After Hendon it flew on manufacturer's trials, carrying the Class B civil test marking ''U-5'' until it was scrapped in May 1938.<ref name="Jackson"/>

The Kestel had not been built to an [[Air Ministry]] specification and did not immediately go into production, being described by some as "premature";<ref name="Lukins"/> but when the winner of the [[List_of_Air_Ministry_Specifications#1930-1939|Air Ministry specification T.6/36]] contract, the very different [[de Havilland Don]] failed, orders for a production development of the Kestrel called the [[Miles Master]] were placed.<ref name="Thetford">{{Harvnb|Thetford|1957|pages=336-7}}</ref>  At the time it was the largest ever order for an RAF training aircraft.  The Master I had some noticeable differences from the Kestrel, particularly in the shape of the rear fuselage and fin, the rudder and elevator balancing, the cockpit glazing and the relocation of the radiator from nose to belly, but was otherwise very similar.

<!--Use one OR other of the two specification templates. Delete the template code of the one you do not use. aero-specs is designed to handle the specification of gliders and lighter-than-air craft well. They each have their own documentation. In aircraft-specifications the parameter "xxxx more" allows for the addition of a qualifier to the value eg "at low level", "unladen". -->
