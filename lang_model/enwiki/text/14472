'''Annie Jump Cannon''' (December 11, 1863 &ndash; April 13, 1941) was an [[United States|American]] [[astronomer]] whose cataloging work was instrumental in the development of contemporary [[stellar classification]]. With [[Edward C. Pickering]], she is credited with the creation of the [[Stellar classification|Harvard Classification Scheme]], which was the first serious attempt to organize and classify stars based on their temperatures.

==Family==

The daughter of shipbuilder and state senator [[Wilson Lee Cannon]] and his second wife, Mary Elizabeth Jump, Annie grew up in [[Dover, Delaware]]. Annie's mother had a childhood interest in star-gazing, and she passed that interest along to her daughter. She had four older step-siblings from her father's first marriage, as well as two brothers, Robert and Wilson. Annie never married but was happy to be an aunt to her brother's children.

==Education==
At Wilmington Conference Academy, Annie was a promising student, particularly in mathematics. In 1880 Annie was sent to [[Wellesley College]] in Massachusetts, one of the top academic schools for women in the U.S. The cold winter climate in the area led to repeated infections, and in one Annie was stricken with [[scarlet fever]]. As a result, Annie became almost completely [[deaf]].

She graduated with a degree in [[physics]] in 1884 and returned home. Uninterested in the limited career opportunities available to women, she grew bored and restless. Her partial hearing loss made socializing difficult, and she was generally older and better educated than most of the unmarried women in the area. She had made a trip to [[Europe]] in 1892 to photograph the [[solar eclipse]], but returned with her situation little improved.

In 1894, however, her mother died. Life in the home grew more difficult, and she finally wrote to her former instructor at Wellesley, Professor of Physics and Astronomy [[Sarah Frances Whiting]], to see if there was a job opening. Whiting hired her as her assistant, which allowed Cannon to take graduate courses at the college. The school had started offering a course in astronomy, which became her true calling. While at Wellesley, Professor Whiting inspired her to learn about [[spectroscopy]]. Also during those years, Cannon developed her skills in the new art of [[photography]].

She returned to Wellesley in 1894 for graduate study in [[physics]] and [[astronomy]]. In order to gain access to a better telescope, she decided to enroll at [[Radcliffe College|Radcliffe Women's College]] at Harvard, which had access to the [[Harvard College Observatory]]. In 1896, [[Edward C. Pickering]] hired Cannon as his assistant at the Harvard observatory. By 1907 she had received a MA from Wellesley.

==Professional history==

In 1896 Annie became a member of ''[[Harvard Computers|Pickering<U+2019>s women]],'' the women hired by Harvard Observatory director [[Edward Charles Pickering]] to complete the [[Henry Draper Catalogue|Draper Catalog]] mapping and defining all the stars in the sky to [[photographic magnitude]] of about 9.  

Anna Draper, the widow of [[Henry Draper]], who was a wealthy physician and amateur astronomer, set up a fund to support the work. Pickering made the Henry Draper Catalog a long-term project to obtain the optical spectra of as many stars as possible, and also to index and classify stars by spectra. If making measurements was hard enough, the development of a reasonable classification was at least as difficult.  

Not long after the work on the Draper Catalog began, a disagreement developed as to how to classify the stars.  [[Antonia Maury]], who was also Henry Draper's niece, insisted on a complex classification system while [[Williamina Fleming]], who was overseeing the project for Pickering, wanted a much more simple, straightforward approach.  Annie Jump Cannon negotiated a compromise.  She started by examining the bright southern hemisphere stars. To these stars she applied a third system, a division of stars into the [[stellar classification|spectral classes O, B, A, F, G, K, M]]. Her scheme was based on the strength of the Balmer absorption lines. After absorption lines were understood in terms of stellar temperatures her initial classification system was rearranged to avoid having to update star catalogues. The [[mnemonic]] of "Oh Be A Fine Girl, Kiss Me" has developed as a way to remember stellar classification.<ref>http://www.astrophysical.org/starclassification.php Star classification</ref>

The female astronomers doing this groundbreaking work at Harvard Observatory earned 25 cents per hour, which was less than what the secretaries at the university earned. <ref>

Annie<U+2019>s work was <U+201C>theory-laced<U+201D> but simplified. Her observation of stars and stellar spectra was extraordinary. Her [[Henry Draper Catalogue]] listed nearly 230,000 stars, all the work of a single observer. Annie also published other catalogues of variable stars, including 300 that she discovered. Her career lasted more than 40 years, during which time women gained acceptance within the scientific community.

Annie Jump Cannon died April 13, 1941 after receiving a regular Harvard appointment as the William C. Bond Astronomer.  She also received the [[Henry Draper Medal]], which only one other female has won, [[Martha P. Haynes]] (who shared it with a male colleague).

==Awards and honors==

* In 1925 received the first honorary doctorate [[Oxford University]] ever awarded to a woman.
* In 1929 the National [[League of Women Voters]] listed her as one of the 12 "greatest living American women".
* In 1931 awarded the [[Henry Draper Medal]] from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=Draper>{{cite web|title=Henry Draper Medal|url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_draper|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref>
* In 1932 awarded the ''Ellen Richards Prize''.
* First woman elected an officer of the [[American Astronomical Society]].
* In 1938 named the ''William Cranch Bond Astronomer'' at Harvard.
* The [[Moon|lunar]] crater [[Cannon (crater)|Cannon]] is named after her.
* She was nicknamed "Census Taker of the Sky" for classifying 230,000 stellar bodies, more than any other person, male or female.
* The [[Annie J. Cannon Award in Astronomy|Annie Jump Cannon Award in Astronomy]] is named in her honor. It has been awarded annually to a woman astronomer in North America since 1934.
