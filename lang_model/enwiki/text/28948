'''Priestfield Stadium''' (popularly known simply as '''Priestfield''' and officially known since [[1 June]] [[2007]] as '''KRBS Priestfield Stadium''' for sponsorship purposes) is a [[football (soccer)|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Gillingham, Medway|Gillingham]], [[Kent]].  It has been the home of [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham Football Club]] since the club's formation in 1893, and was also the temporary home of [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion Football Club]] for two seasons during the 1990s.  The stadium has also hosted women's and youth international matches.  

The stadium underwent extensive redevelopment during the late 1990s, which has brought its capacity down from nearly 20,000 to a current figure of 11,582.  It has four all-seater stands, all constructed since 1997, although one is only of a temporary nature.  There are also conference and banqueting facilities and a nightspot named the Blues Rock Caf<U+00E9>.  Despite having invested heavily in its current stadium, Gillingham F.C. has plans to relocate to a new stadium.

==History==
New Brompton Football Club, the forerunner of Gillingham Football Club, formed in June 1893. At the same time an area of land in Gillingham was acquired by the club's founders, the purchase being funded through an issue of 1,500 <U+00A3>1 shares.<ref name=p7>{{cite book

By 1908 further improvements had been made, with a second stand added, bringing the total number of seats to 800, and terracing added at the [[Rainham, Kent|Rainham]] end of the ground.  In 1912 the club's first Supporters' Association was formed, its initial project being to raise the necessary funds to construct terracing at the opposite end of the ground.<ref name=p6>{{cite book

The facilities at Priestfield were highlighted as one of the club's strengths in the brochure, which listed the ground's capacity as "between 25,000 and 30,000" but stated that plans had been drawn up to increase the capacity to 50,000, with 5,000 seats.<ref name=p16>{{cite book

The ground underwent its most extensive redevelopment to date in 1955, at a total cost of <U+00A3>28,500.  The previously sloping pitch was levelled, the Gordon Road side of the ground re-terraced, and new covered accommodation erected between the Rainham End and Gordon Road stands.<ref name=p23>{{cite book

New owner [[Paul Scally]] took over at the club in 1995 and soon instigated a programme of redevelopment which completely transformed the formerly run-down ground.  The stand on the southern side of the pitch, which had been closed for a number of years, was replaced with the new Gordon Road Stand in 1997 at a cost of over <U+00A3>2 million.  Two years later the Rainham End terracing was replaced with a new all-seater stand, with the sports centre behind it demolished and replaced with a car park.<ref name="OS">{{cite web|url=http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/PriestfieldStadium/0,,10416,00.html|publisher=Gillingham F.C.|title=The Changing Face of KRBS Priestfield|date=2007-09-07|accessdate=2007-11-06}}</ref>

[[Image:RainhamEndGordonRoadStand.jpg|thumb|right|300px|thumb|The Rainham End and Gordon Road Stand during a match in 2007.]]
The main stand on the northern side of the pitch was demolished in 1999, along with a section of away terracing, to be replaced with a new state-of-the-art facility dubbed the Medway Stand, but the work was beset by problems.  Due to serious delays with the building of the new stand, the club was forced to spend most of the subsequent season first with that side of the ground completely empty, then later with building work ongoing.  Supporters were not able to sit in the new stand until April 2000,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gillsconnect.com/default.asp?p=2&sid=934&stid=180589|title=New Stand To Open|author=Keith Pestell|publisher=GillsConnect|accessdate=2007-11-07|date=2000-04-11}}</ref> and even then many of the facilities had not been finished.<ref name="OS" />  The stand also caused severe financial problems for the club, as its original estimated cost of <U+00A3>3.9 million was exceeded by more than <U+00A3>5 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gillsconnect.com/default.asp?p=2&sid=934&stid=8413699|title=Gillingham FC PLC AGM Report|author=Keith Pestell|publisher=GillsConnect|accessdate=2007-11-06|date=2006-06-14}}</ref>

The fourth side of the ground was redeveloped in 2003 when the Town End terracing was removed and a temporary stand put in its place, named after the late football commentator and Gillingham supporter [[Brian Moore (commentator)|Brian Moore]].  It was hoped that work would begin on a permanent Brian Moore Stand in 2004,<ref name="OS" /> but due to talk of relocating the club to a new ground and the club's current financial problems, this has been put on hold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/aroundthegrounds/Gillingham---Priestfield-Stadium.2984470.jp|title=Gillingham - Priestfield Stadium|publisher=Yorkshire Evening Post|accessdate=2007-11-07|date=2007-06-27}}</ref>

==Structure and facilities==
[[Image:PlanOfPriestfield.png|thumb|right|300px|thumb|A plan of the stadium's layout]]
The pitch is surrounded by four [[All-seater stadium|all-seater stands]] - the Medway Stand, the Rainham End, the Gordon Road Stand and the Brian Moore Stand. All are covered with the exception of the Brian Moore Stand.  The Medway Stand, which replaced the old Main Stand and part of the terracing at each end, is the largest and northernmost of the four. It has two tiers with a row of twenty executive boxes between the top and bottom tier. The stand also contains the changing rooms, physiotherapy facilities, club offices and club shop.<ref name="OS" />  The Rainham End, located behind the goal at the eastern end of the pitch, opened in 1999 and houses 2,400 fans.  This stand, like the terrace it replaced, is known for housing the club's most vocal supporters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fsf.org.uk/ground-guide/stadiums/gillingham/priestfield-stadium/|title=Gillingham|publisher=Football Supporters' Federation|accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref>  The Gordon Road Stand, which seats 2,600, was opened in 1997 and is opposite the Medway Stand.  Due to planning requirements, the stand had a height restriction placed upon it, making it significantly lower than the other three sides of the ground, and due to the road layout behind it is narrower at one end than the other.<ref name="OS" />  A gantry for television cameras is located on the roof of this stand.<ref name="FGG" />

[[Image:TownEnd1980s.jpg|400px|thumb|left|The slope of the old Gillingham End is apparent in this photo from the mid 1980s.]]
Opposite the Rainham End is the Brian Moore Stand.  This stand is a temporary one, and accommodates both home and away fans, with the facility to vary the proportion of space offered to each, and the buffer zone between them, depending on the anticipated number of visiting fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/TravelMatchPack/0,,10416~405497,00.html|title=Travel match pack|publisher=Gillingham F.C.|accessdate=2007-11-08|date=2006-04-20}}</ref>  It occupies the site of the former Town End terracing, which was unusual in that it had a pronounced slope, with one end of the terracing being higher up than the other.  In 1955 the pitch, which previously sloped at that end of the stadium, was levelled out but the gradient of the Town End was left unchanged.<ref name="p23" />

The state of the stadium's pitch caused the club severe problems in 2003.  A number of fixtures had to be postponed due to the state of the pitch,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/01/36341.htm |title=Gills topple Wednesday|publisher=The FA|accessdate=2007-11-22|date=2003-01-08}}</ref> which was described as resembling a ploughed field,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2003/03/05/sfggil05.xml |title=Huckerby class tells|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|author=Steve Thomson|accessdate=2007-11-22|date=2003-03-04}}</ref> and the surface had to be heavily sanded before an [[FA Cup]] match against [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/2671827.stm|title=Leeds held at Gillingham|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2007-11-22|date=2003-02-13}}</ref>  At the end of the season, taking advantage of the demolition of the old Town End, which allowed better access to the pitch, the club had the drainage system replaced and a completely new pitch laid.<ref name="OS" />

[[Image:BrianMooreStand.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The current Brian Moore Stand, visible in the right hand portion of the picture, has been constructed on a temporary basis only.]]
Added to the new stands were several new developments. The Conference and Banqueting Centre, which is located behind the Rainham End, comprises the Great Hall, which can accommodate up to 700 delegates for events, and twenty smaller delegate rooms.<ref name="Ven" />  The Centre is connected to the Medway Stand, thus allowing views from the banqueting suite onto the pitch,<ref name="OS" /> and is also licensed for wedding ceremonies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medway.gov.uk/index/community/registeroffice/ceremonyvenues/27958.htm|title=Birth, death and marriage registration|publisher=Medway Council|accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref>  The Blues Rock Caf<U+00E9> nightspot, located within the Medway Stand, is open between four and five nights a week and stages live music and screenings of major sporting events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/BluesCafe/0,,10416,00.html|title=Details of the club's premier nightspot|publisher=Gillingham F.C.|accessdate=2007-11-08|date=2007-09-07}}</ref>  The club purchased many of the fixtures and fittings for these new developments at discounted prices when the furnishings of the [[Millennium Dome]] were sold off upon its closure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20030119/ai_n9682090|title=Football: He paid <U+00A3>1 for the club.

Despite the stadium's new facilities, Priestfield is still viewed in a negative light in some circles.  In 2004 it was voted the worst football ground in England by a poll in the [[Guardian (newspaper)|Guardian]] newspaper, although most of the comments made in the poll concerned the town of Gillingham itself, rather than the actual stadium as a building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,1324085,00.html|title=Simply the worst|publisher=The Guardian|author=Gemma Clarke|accessdate=2007-11-05|date=2004-10-10}}</ref>  A 2006 poll undertaken by a property website revealed that 39% of residents deemed the stadium the ugliest building in the town and believed it could discourage people from purchasing property in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findaproperty.com/displaystory.aspx?edid=00&salerent=0&storyid=9337|title=Upper Gillingham Most Sought-After |publisher=FindaProperty.com|accessdate=2007-11-07|date=2006-05-17}}</ref>

==Future==
Gillingham chairman [[Paul Scally]] has made it clear that he intends to relocate the club away from its current stadium, announcing in  September 2003 that "there is no future for the club at the Priestfield".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/g/gillingham/3130036.stm|title=Scally considers Gills future|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2007-11-05|date=2003-09-22}}</ref>  In 2004 the club outlined plans for a new stadium at [[Cuxton]] but abandoned them soon afterwards due to the cost of improving transport links to the site.  At the time Scally stated that he anticipated the club moving within four years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/3857867.stm|title=Gillingham vow to remain in Kent|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2007-11-06|date=2004-07-01}}</ref> but by 2007 the proposed date had been pushed back to 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/g/gillingham/6286217.stm|title=Gills targeting 2010 stadium move|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2007-11-06|date=2007-01-22}}</ref>  Assuming the club does eventually move it is anticipated that Priestfield would be redeveloped for housing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww2.medway.gov.uk/FTP/Cabinet_Decisions/is610/reports/report_610_679.doc|title=Temple Waterfront - Development Proposals|publisher=Medway Council|accessdate=2007-11-08|date=2004-01-27}} (Microsoft Word document)</ref> 

Despite the proposed move, the club is promoting its facilities, in conjunction with [[Medway]] Council, as a possible training base for athletes competing in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], saying:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medway.gov.uk/london2012/55326/56285.htm|title=Gillingham Football Club|publisher=Medway Council|accessdate=2007-11-06}}</ref>{{cquote|The Medway Stand is fully equipped with physio rooms, a hydrotherapy pool, a sauna and steam rooms to assist with the athletes' training, and a lounge bar, a cinema and a snooker room for them to enjoy during their free time.  The club's offices, media centre and press room could also provide the coaches with a good administrative base.  We are excited about the prospect of international athletes benefitting from our excellent facilities in preparation for London 2012.}}
