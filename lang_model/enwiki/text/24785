'''St Buryan''' (''[[Cornish language|Cornish]]: Eglosborrie'') is a [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] and village in [[Cornwall]], [[United Kingdom]].

The village of St Buryan is situated approximately five miles (8&nbsp;km) west of [[Penzance]] along the [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|B3283]] towards [[Land's End]]. Three further minor roads also meet at St Buryan, two link the village with the [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|B3315]] towards [[Lamorna]], and the third rejoins the [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|A30]] at [[Crows-an-Wra]].<ref>Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 ''Land's End'' ISBN 9780319231487</ref>

St Buryan parish encompasses the villages of St. Buryan, [[Lamorna]], and [[Crows-an-wra]] and shares boundaries with the parishes of [[Sancreed]] and [[St Just in Penwith|St Just]] to the north, [[Sennen]] and [[St Levan]] (with which it has close ties) to the west, with [[Paul, Cornwall|Paul]] to the east and by the sea in the south.

Named after the [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Saint Buriana]], the parish is situated in an area of outstanding natural beauty and is a popular tourist destination. It has been a designated [[conservation area]] since 1990 and is near many [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|sites of special scientific interest]] in the surrounding area. 

The parish is dotted with evidence of [[Neolithic]] activity, from stone circles and Celtic crosses to burial chambers and ancient holy wells. The village of St Buryan itself is also a site of special historic interest, and contains many [[listed buildings]] including the famous grade I listed Church. The bells of [[The church of St Buryan|St Buryan Church]], which have recently undergone extensive renovation, are the heaviest full circle peal of six anywhere in the world. The parish also has a strong cultural heritage. 

Many painters of the [[Newlyn School]] including [[Lamorna Birch|Samuel John "Lamorna" Birch]] were based at Lamorna in the south of the parish. St Buryan Village Hall was also the former location of Pipers Folk Club, created in the late 1960s by celebrated Cornish singer [[Brenda Wootton]].Today St Buryan is a prominent local centre housing many important amenities. 

==Geography==
[[Image:Buryanall copy.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Topographical map of St. Buryan parish showing location within the UK (left, top) and within the former [[Penwith]] district (inset, bottom)]]
The parish, which is generally fertile and well cultivated, comprises 6,972 [[acre]]s (2,821 [[hectare|ha]]) of land, 3 acres (1 ha) of water and 18 acres (7 ha) of foreshore and lies predominantly on [[granite]].<ref name=genuki>''GENUKI'', 2006. "[http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/Cornwall/StBuryan/ St Buryan]."</ref> It is more elevated at its northern part and slopes gently north to south-east towards the sea. [[Chapel Carn Brea]], (50<U+00B0>09'N, 5<U+00B0>65W), often described as the first hill in Cornwall (from a westerly perspective), sits at its northernmost edge and rises 657 feet (200 m)<!--if this is actually the original, it should be first and the conversion likely rounded to {{convert|660|ft|m|abbr=on}}--> above sea level The hill is also an important historical site showing evidence of neolithic activity, as well as the remains of the chapel from which it is named. Toward the south is the village of St Buryan, which sits on a plateau and is centrally sited within the parish. Further to the south the terrain slopes down toward the sea, ending in several deep cut river valleys at [[Lamorna]], [[Penberth]] and [[St Loy's Cove|St Loy]] that are both sheltered and heavily forested. West of St Buryan, toward St Levan, the terrain again gently descends, causing the ground to become more [[marsh]]y and waterlogged and less suitable for growing arable crops. East of the village the land also slopes away toward [[Drift, Cornwall|Drift]], and [[Drift Reservoir|its reservoir]], past the wooded area at [[Pridden]] and the deep cut valley at [[Trelew, Cornwall|Trelew]] (in which a steep embankment has been built to carry the B3283 road). Other settlements of note in the parish include [[Crows-an-Wra]] to the north, as well as [[Sparnon]] and [[Tregarnoe]] further south (see map, right). Since 1990 St Buryan and the surrounding region has been designated a [[conservation area]] by Penwith District Council;<ref>Penwith District Council, 2005. "[http://www.penwith.gov.uk/media/adobe/m/c/CONSERVATION_AREA_LIST.pdf List of conservation areas]."</ref> recognising the village's status as an area of special architectural and historic interest and preventing development that might alter the village's character.

The village is named after the 6th century Irish Christian missionary [[Saint Buriana]] (also sometimes called Beriana, Buriena, or Beriena). The local legend describes how, whilst ministering to the local inhabitants from the oratory that stood on the site of the current church, Saint Buriana was abducted by the local king, [[Geraint]] (or Gereint) of [[Dumnonia]]. [[Saint Piran]], [[patron saint]] of Cornwall and also a fellow missionary, negotiated for her release, but the reticent Geraint agreed only on the caveat that the he be awoken by a [[cuckoo]] calling across the snow, something which would be highly unlikely in mid-winter. The legend states that [[Saint Piran]] prayed through the night whilst the snow fell, and in the morning Geraint was awoken by a cuckoo's song. He was so taken aback by the miracle that he honoured his pledge, however, shortly afterwards he changed his mind and tried to recapture Buriana. Buriana is said to have died as Geraint tried to re-imprison her, and was purportedly buried on the site of her chapel.<ref name=wp3>Blight, J. T. 1856.

==History==
St Buryan and the surrounding area is rich in history and has been a centre of human activity for several thousand years.

===Early Neolithic Period===
[[File:CrowsanWraCelticcross.jpg|thumb|left|Celtic cross near [[Chapel Carn Brea]] in the north of St. Buryan parish]]
The area surrounding St Buryan was in use by humans in [[Neolithic]] times, as is evident from the their surviving monuments. A mile (1.5&nbsp;km) to the north of St Buryan lies [[Boscawen-Un]], a neolithic [[Megalithic|stone circle]] containing 19 stones around a leaning central pillar.<ref>Tom Bullock, 2002. "[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=22 Boscawen Un]." ''Megalithic Portal''. Verified 2006-08-24.</ref> The circle is also associated with two nearby standing stones or [[menhirs]]. Although somewhat overgrown, the site can be reached by traveling along the [[A30 road|A30]] west of Drift and is only a few hundred metres south of the road. A more accessible stone circle, [[The Merry Maidens]], lies 2 miles (3&nbsp;km) to the south of the village in a field along the B3315 toward [[Land's End]]. This much larger circle comprises nineteen granite megaliths some as much as 1.4 metres ([[foot (length)|4'7"]]) tall, is approximately 24 metres (79&nbsp;ft) in diameter and is thought to be complete. Stones are regularly spaced around the circle with a gap or entrance at its eastern edge. The Merry Maidens are also called Dawn's Men, which is likely to be a corruption of the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''Dans Maen'', or Stone Dance. The local myth about the creation of the stones suggests that nineteen maidens were turned into stone as punishment for dancing on a Sunday. The pipers' two megaliths some distance north-east of the circle are said to be the petrified remains of the musicians who played for the dancers. This legend was likely initiated by the early Christian Church to prevent old [[Paganism|pagan]] habits continuing at the site.<ref>''Stones of England'', n.d. "[http://www.stonepages.com/england/merrymaidens.html The Merry Maidens]." Verified 2006-08-24.</ref>

Like [[Stonehenge]] and other stone monuments built during this period the original purpose of such stone circles is unknown, although there is strong evidence that they may have been ceremonial or religious sites. Many other lone standing stones from the neolithic period can be seen around the parish, at sites including [[Pridden]], [[Trelew, Cornwall|Trelew]], Chyangwens and Trevorgans. In addition to menhirs there are numerous stone crosses within the parish, including two fine examples in St Buryan itself, one in the churchyard, and the other in the centre of the village. These take the form of a standing stone, sometimes carved into a [[Celtic cross]] but more often left roughly circular with a carved figure on the face. It is thought that many of these are pagan in origin, dating from the Neolithic and later periods, but were adapted by the early Christian church to remove evidence of the previous religion.<ref name=cch>Alex Everitt, n.d. "[http://www.krowskernewek.com/celtic-cross-history.htm A Brief History of the Celtic Cross in Cornwall]". Verified 2006-08-24.</ref> These crosses are often remote and mark/protect ancient crossing points.<ref name=cch/> Other examples in the parish can be found at [[Crows-an-Wra]], Trevorgans and Vellansaga.

===Bronze and Iron Ages===
Only several hundred yards from the site of the Merry Maidens lies a [[Bronze age]] burial chamber, [[Cruk Tregyffian]], that was discovered (and unfortunately damaged) during widening of the adjacent B3315 road. The circular [[tumulus|barrow]] is composed of stone uprights decorated with cupmarks, dry stone walling and four capstones.<ref>''Megalithic Portal'', n.d. "[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=166 Tregiffian Barrow]." Verified 2006-08-24.</ref> Although the original decorated stone has been removed to [[Royal Cornwall Museum|Truro  museum]] to protect it against weathering, a replica now sits in its place. Further east along the B3315 road, and only a mile from [[Lamorna]], lies the Boleigh [[fogou]], considered to be one of the best remaining monuments of its kind in Cornwall.<ref name=fogou>''Megalithic Portal'', n.d. "[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=582 Boleigh - Souterrain]." Verified 2006-08-24.</ref> Built in the [[Iron age]], the purpose of [[fogou]]s (derived from the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] word for cave) is not known. It has been speculated, however, that they could have been used for food storage or for religious ceremonies.<ref>''Rosemerryn Wood'', n.d. "[http://www.rosemerrynwood.co.uk/fogou.htm Fogou]." Verified 2006-08-24.</ref> The fogou at Boleigh is extensive and has a large entranceway that leads to a long passage with classic dry stone wall and lintel construction. A low doorway just inside the entrance leads to a much narrower and lower passage that turns ninety degrees left after a few metres. After the turn the passage continues for a metre or two before ending; there is a modern metal support grille set into the roof above this section.<ref name=fogou/>

===Middle Ages===
Human activity in the parish continued and intensified in the [[Middle Ages]]. A revolt against the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon English]] in 931 AD by the [[Cornish people|Cornish Celts]] (supported by the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]]) led to a battle southeast of the village at Boleigh where a farm and hamlet now stands. The [[Saxons|Saxon]] king [[Athelstan]] crushed the resistance, before continuing on to conquer the [[Isles of Scilly]]. A local story tells of ancient armour being ploughed up in the nearby fields at Gul Reeve (a corruption of the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''Gwel Ruth'', meaning red field).<ref name=hosking>Jim Hosking, 2002. ''People Places & Past Events in St Buryan''. Penzance: J. M. Hosking ISBN 0-9501296-5-8</ref> The establishment of a church and monastery in the village by Athelstan (see [[St Buryan#Religion|Religion]]) contributed to the rising importance of the parish. This was not without problems, and in 1328 St Buryan was [[excommunicated]] from the church over a row about control of the religious matters in the parish. It was not reinstated for another eight years.<ref name=hosking/>

After the [[Norman conquest]] the area fell under the control of [[Robert, Count of Mortain]], a half-brother of [[William the Conqueror]], and the parish of St Buryan is mentioned in the [[Domesday book]] with the old [[Cornish language|Cornish]] name of ''Eglosberrie'' (and elsewhere Eglosburrie) meaning 'church of St. Buryan':

{{cquote|''"EGLOSBERRIE; it was free in the time of King [[Edward the Confessor|Edward]] (the Confessor, i.e. before 1066); 1 hide (about 120 acres). Land for 8 ploughs (requiring, perhaps, 8 oxen each); <U+00BD> plough there. 6 villagers and 6 smallholders. Pasture, 20 acres. Value 10s; when the Count (of Mortain) received the land, value 40s. Also 12 cattle and 12 sheep."'' <ref>Thorn, Caroline & Frank [eds.], 1979. ''Domesday Book: Cornwall''. Phillimore, Chichester. ISBN 0-85033-155-2</ref>}}

St Buryan was visited by [[John of England|King John]] in the early 13th century who, after landing at [[Sennen]] from Ireland, travelled to the parish to stay the night. The purpose of the visit was an inspection of local mining works in the area and resulted in the import of [[German people|German]] engineers to improve their efficiency.<ref name=hosking/> By the 14th century St Buryan's importance as a regional centre had grown sufficiently that in 1302 [[Edward I of England|King Edward]] granted it a weekly market, to be held on Saturdays, and two yearly [[fair]]s of three days each to be held on the feasts of St Buryan and St Martin.<ref name=hosking/>

===Tudor and Stuart period===
[[File:StBuryancross.jpg|right|thumb|Stone cross in St Buryan village churchtown and Belmont house, former location of the King's Arms public house, in the background]]

Perhaps one of the most notable residents of St Buryan during the seventeenth century was one [[William Noy]], an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] (Grampound 1603<U+2013>1614, Fowey 1623<U+2013>1625 and Helston 1627<U+2013>1631)<ref>http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5749 Timeline of Cornish history</ref> and member of the court of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], who was born and lived on the Pendrea estate within the parish.<ref name=hosking/> He was created [[Attorney-general]] to the king in October 1631 and specialised in reviving long forgotten taxes to raise money to fund the King's lifestyle during his period of [[Personal Rule]].<ref>[http://www.aberconwy.conwy.sch.uk/curriculum/history/sixth_history/religionfinance.htm. Enable ASP<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> His advice controversially led to the imposition of [[ship money]] which is thought by many to have helped trigger the [[English Civil War]].<ref>James Wood, ed. ''The Nuttall Encyclop<U+00E6>dia of General Knowledge'' (1907) reproduced at http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Wood-NuttallEncyclopaedia/s/ship-money.html</ref> Noy suffered from [[kidney stone|stones]], and died in great pain before being buried at the church in [[New Brentford]] in 1634.<ref>''Encyclopedia Britannica'' (1911) vol. V19 ''"Biography of William Noy"''</ref>

[[Smuggling]] activity in Britain became more prevalent though the Tudor and Stuart period reaching its peak at the end of the 18th century. High rates of duty were levied on imported wine, spirits, and other luxury goods in order to pay for Britain's expensive wars with France and the United States. Cornwall was a haven for smugglers at this time, with its many secluded coves ideally suited for evasion of the duty, a smuggling provided a highly profitable venture for impoverished fishermen and seafarers. St Buryan was no different in this respect, and also home to smuggling activity.<ref name =hosking/> Thomas Johns, a known smuggler and agent of smugglers, was the landlord of the Kings Arms public house, formerly on the site of Belmont House in the village square, who divided his time between St Buryan and his liquor establishments in [[Roscoff]], Brittany.<ref name =hosking/> More famous still was the Lamorna wink public house near Lamorna Cove which was also a base for smugglers. The pub was so named as winking at the barman would reputedly allow you to purchase smuggled spirits.<ref name=hosking/>

===Industrial revolution===
[[Image:StBuryanpopulation.png|thumb|300px|right|Population change from 1800 to the present day in St Buryan [[civil parish|parish]] (lefthand scale) compared to [[Penwith]] [[district]](righthand scale)[http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/Cornwall/StBuryan/].]]

Whereas St Buryan was an important regional religious centre during the [[Middle Ages]] due to its [[monastery]] and [[Royal Peculiar]] status, the importance of the parish to the district faded with the onset the [[industrial revolution]]. This was in part due to the destruction of the collegiate buildings during [[The Protectorate]] period after the [[English civil war|civil war]]<ref>"[http://west-penwith.org.uk/buryan93.htm Kelly<U+2019>s Directory of Cornwall 1893]", quoted in ''West Penwith Resources''.</ref> and also the gradual weakening of the political position of the [[Church of England]] that occurred during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This loss of importance is reflected in the fact that the proportion of the district's population living in the parish fell from four and a half to less than two percent over this period.<ref name=genuki/> Unlike other parishes in [[Penwith]], such as [[St Just in Penwith|St Just]], St Buryan was not a major focus of tin mining activity during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, having a mainly [[agrarian]] economy. After a spike in population in the early 19th century that is mirrored across the district and coincides both with the arrival of the railways and increased tin mining activity in [[Penwith]], the population of the parish gradually declined over the next two hundred years (see figure right), in part due to the increased mechanisation of farming that the industrial revolution brought, requiring fewer people to work the land. [[China clay]], Cornwall's other great mining export in addition to tin, was mined in the parish for a brief period in the nineteenth century in two pits at Tridinney Common and Bartdinney Downs by the Land's End China Clay Company. Although initially successful, by 1891 they had become economically inviable. Although a newly formed company Zennorin Developments Ltd applied to reopen the pits in 1970, this was rejected on the grounds that it would spoil an area of outstanding natural beauty

===Twentieth century===
After a period of decline during the twentieth century, which saw a reduction in the village's population (see figure), culminating in the loss of a blacksmiths, the local dairy, the village butchers and a cafe in the early nineties, St Buryan has been enjoying a renaissance, fueled in part by an influx of new families. The local school has been expanded to include a hall and a fourth classroom and a new community centre has recently been built nearby.

In common with other settlements in the district such as Newlyn and Penzance, the post-war period saw the building of a council estate to the west of the village on land formerly part of Parcancady farm. The development was meant to provide affordable housing at a time of short supply in the post-war years. The estate subsequently expanded westward in the nineteen eighties and nineties. In the last census return, St Buryan parish was reported as containing contains 533 dwellings housing 1215 people, 1030 of which were living in the village itself <ref name=census>2001 UK census</ref><ref>Penwith District Council, 2000. [http://www.penwith.gov.uk/media/adobe/9/s/parish%20population.PDF Parish population estimates] (PDF)</ref>

==Religion==
St Buryan has a long history of religious activity both through its historical connection with the church of the state, and later playing an important part in the [[Methodism|Methodist]] revival of the 18th century, led by [[John Wesley]] who visited the parish and ministered on several occasions.

===The Church of St Buryan===
{{main|The Church of St. Buryan}}
[[Image:StBuryanChurchFront.jpg|thumb|right|The church of St Buryan as seen from the front entrance]]
A church has stood on the current site since ca. 930 AD, built by [[King Athelstan]] in thanks for his successful conquest of Cornwall on the site of the [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] of Saint Buriana (probably founded in the 5th century). The Charter from Athelstan endowed the building of collegiate buildings and the establishment of one of the earliest monasteries in Cornwall, and was subsequently enlarged and rededicated to the saint in 1238 by Bishop [[William Briwere]]. The collegiate establishment consisted of a dean and three prebendaries.<ref name=genuki/><ref>Stone, John Frederick Matthias Harris (1912) ''England's Riviera: a topographical and arch<U+00E6>ological description of Land's End, Cornwall and adjacent spots of beauty and interest''.

St Buryan was not reinstated until 1336.<ref>F. C. Hingeston-Randolph, ed. ''Episcopal Registers: Diocese of Exeter''. Vols. 1-4. London: George Bell, 1886-97 </ref> Only two of the King's appointed Deans appear to have actually lived in the diocese of St Buryan for more than a few months, and the combination of these factors led to the subsequent ruinous state of the church in 1473. The church was subsequently rebuilt and enlarged, the tower was added in 1501<ref>''This Is The Westcountry'', n.d. "[http://www.communigate.co.uk/twc/stburyanchurchbellringers/ The Great Bells of St Buryan, Cornwall]." Verified 2006-08-24.</ref> and further expansion took place in the late 15th and 16th centuries when the bulk of the present church building were added. Further restoration of the interior took place in 1814, and the present Lady Chapel was erected in 1956.<ref name=wp3/> The church is currently classified as a Grade I [[listed building]]. The Deanery was annexed in 1663 to the [[Diocese of Exeter|Bishopric of Exeter]] after the [[English Civil War]], however, it was again severed during the [[episcopacy]] of Bishop Harris, who thus became the first truly independent dean.<ref>Lewis, S. (1831) ''Topographical Dictionary of England''</ref> The current diocese holds jurisdiction over the parishes of St Buryan, [[St Levan]], and [[Sennen]]. St Buryan church is famous for having the heaviest peal of six bells in the world, and a recent campaign to restore the church's bells, which had fallen into disuse, has enabled all six to be rung properly for the first time in decades.<ref>The Worcestershire & Districts Change Ringing Association, n.d. "{{citeweb|url=http://www.wdcra.org.uk/study/weight.htm |title=Imperial Bell Weights}}"</ref> The church has four 15th century [[misericord]]s, two either side of the chancel, each of which shows a plain shield.

===Methodism===
[[Image:StBuryanMethodistChapel.jpg|thumb|right|St Buryan [[Methodist]] chapel, rebuilt in 1981 after storm damage]]
John Wesley, the founding father of [[Methodism]], visited the parish on several occasions, but was not well received at first. He first visited St Buryan in 1747 where he preached at Tredinney, and later attended services at the church in St Buryan during which the local reverend is reputed to have made several caustic remarks about him.<ref name=hosking/> A second visit in 1766, during which he preached from outside the church, led to him being threatened with a whip by the local squire, however this only strengthened his resolve to return.<ref name=hosking/> The first Methodist chapel was built in 1783 on a site opposite the current day chapel, on land purchased the previous year and inspected by Wesley himself during his last visit to the parish. In 1833, as Methodism became more popular in Cornwall, a second larger chapel was built on the site of the current one. This was subsequently rebuilt in 1981 after suffering storm damage to the old structure. Further Chapels were built in the parish, at Crows-an-Wra in 1831 with seating for 220 as a replacement for an earlier chapel at nearby Treve and at Borah in 1817 with seating for 100, which was rebuilt in 1878. Both of these closed in 1981 to coincide with the enlargement of the St Buryan Chapel.<ref name=wpchap>''West Penwith Resources'', 2005. "[http://west-penwith.org.uk/wpenchap.htm St. Just Methodist Circuits]."</ref> A [[Bible Christian]] group also operated in the village, founded circa 1815. With growing support a proper chapel was built in 1860 on the site of the current Hosken's meadow. This was closed in 1932 but left derelict for another 65 years before being demolished.<ref name=wpchap/>

==Education==
[[Image:StBuryanPrimarySchool.jpg|thumb|left|St Buryan primary school in Rectory Road St Buryan]]
The first record of a school in the parish was in 1801, on a site adjacent to the old [[poorhouse]] beside the church buildings in the main village. This was administered through the poorhouse, whose trustees were also the trustees of the school. A new school was built in 1830 which now forms the village hall. The school was subscription based and pupils paid a penny a day toward their education. When compulsory education was introduced in 1875 these buildings were extended to deal with the influx of pupils. The school moved again to its present site, a new purpose built building along Rectory Road, in 1910. Today St. Buryan primary school teaches pupils between the ages of four and eleven and is a [[feeder school]] for nearby Cape Cornwall Comprehensive School. There was until recently an attached nursery for taking care of children of pre-school age, but this has subsequently moved to new premises in the village. For many years the school taught in its original three classrooms, however under the headship of Paul Gazzard the site has been expanded to include a fourth classroom, a hall and gymnasium, a library and a new reception area. This expansion was made financially possible in part due to a spell as a [[grant maintained school]] during the previous [[Tory]] [[Administration (government)|administration]] in which the school had direct control over its own budget. Under the [[School Standards and Framework Act 1998]] the school became a [[foundation school]].

The school currently teaches 87 pupils from the villages and the surrounding parish.<ref name=ofsted>[http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/111/111798.pdf St Buryan School Ofsted inspection report]</ref> There has been a steady rise in pupil numbers in recent years made possible by the improved facilities and mirroring the population rise in the parish as a whole. All pupils come from a white British background and use English as their first language. Nearly six percent of pupils have Statement of Special Educational Need, which is above the national average.<ref name=ofsted/> In the recent [[Ofsted]] inspection pupils<U+2019> standards of achievement were classed as good overall with above average results in science and English and very high attainment in mathematics.

==Culture==
[[File:Boscawen1.jpg|right|thumb|Boscawen-Un stone circle near St Buryan]]
Like much of the rest of Cornwall, St Buryan has many strong cultural traditions. The first Cornish [[Gorsedd]] ([[Gorseth Kernow]]) in over one thousand years was held in the parish in the stone circle at [[Boscawen-Un]] on 21 September 1928. The procession, guided by the [[bard]]s of the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] Gorsedd and spoken mostly in [[Cornish language|Cornish]] was aimed at promoting Cornish culture and literature. The modern Gorsedd has subsequently been performed nine times in the parish including the fiftieth anniversary, both at Boscawen-Un and the stone circle at [[The Merry Maidens]].<ref name=hosking/> There is also a regular [[Eisteddfod]] held in the village.  St Buryan is also the home of a wisewoman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villagewisewoman.co.uk/|title=Cassandra Latham the wisewoman|last=Cassandra Latham|accessdate=2009-06-04}}</ref> and was surveyed for the [[Survey of English Dialects]].  The feast of St Buriana is celebrated on the Sunday nearest to May 13 (although the St Buriana's official day is 1 May) consisting of fancy dress and competitions for the children of the village and usually other entertainments later in the evening. In the summer there are also several other festivals, including the agricultural preservation rally in which vintage tractor, farm equipment, rare breed animals and [[threshing machine|threshing]] demonstrations are shown as well as some vintage cars and [[traction engine]]s. This is currently being hosted at Trevorgans farm and is traditionally held on the last Saturday of July. St Buryan is also twinned with [[Calan, Morbihan|Calan]] in [[Morbihan]], [[Brittany]].<ref>http://cwic.cornwall.gov.uk/cwic-sql/details.asp?pl=ST.+GENNYS&i=O16814&a=O10 Cornwall County Council list of twin towns and villages</ref>

===Art===
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the parish attracted many painters from the [[Newlyn school]], particularly at Lamorna where a small colony led by [[Lamorna Birch|Samuel John "Lamorna" Birch]] was established and included painters such as [[Alfred Munnings]], [[Laura Knight]] and Harold Knight who lived and painted there. These artists were attracted by cheap living, the changeable quality of the light and a desire to paint [[En plein air]]. This style of painting had become increasingly popular after the introduction of paints in tubes in the 1870s, an innovation which meant that painters no longer had to make their own paints by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil.<ref>http://www.penleehouse.org.uk/art-history/lamorna-artists.htm ''"The Lamorna Artists"'' Penlee House Museum & Art Gallery website</ref>

==Economy==
[[Image:StBuryanFarmland01.jpg|thumb|right|Farmland cut for hay in St Buryan parish]]
The major economic activity in the parish is agriculture and the parish encompasses several large farms. Most agriculture centres around [[dairy farming|dairying]], with arable crops such as potato and cauliflower being farmed as well as some raising of pigs and sheep. As with much of Cornwall, fishing is an important source of income and employment. Many smaller crabbers and landline fishermen operate from the various coves and harbours on the rocky shore. Before its closure at the turn of the millennium the transatlantic telephone cable station, and telecommunications educational facility, run by [[Cable and Wireless]] at [[Porthcurno]] provided further employment opportunities in the neighbouring parish of St Levan. Its central location in west [[Penwith]] and proximity to popular tourist attractions such as the [[Minack Theatre]], [[Land's End]] and the [[Blue Flag beach]] at [[Sennen]] Cove,<ref>''Blue Flag'', n.d. "[http://www.blueflag.org/blueflag/2005/UnitedKingdom/SouthWest/SennenCove(Whitesands) Sennen Cove]."</ref> mean that St Buryan enjoys a healthy income from visitors, both day trippers and those renting accommodation, during the summer months.

==Government and politics==
For the purposes of local government St Buryan is a civil parish and elects 11 councillors every four years.<ref>http://www.penwith.gov.uk/media/adobe/i/9/buryan.pdf Penwith District Council list of parish councillors</ref> The principal local authority in this area is [[Cornwall Council]].

==Transport==
Being one of the most westerly parishes in England, St Buryan is somewhat isolated from the rest of the UK. The village of St Buryan is situated approximately five miles (eight km) west of [[Penzance]] along the [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|B3283]] which forks about five miles (8&nbsp;km) from the end of the [[A30 road|A30]], the major trunk road that runs the length of Cornwall. Three further minor roads also meet at St Buryan, two link the village with the [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|B3315]] towards [[Lamorna]], and the third rejoins the A30 at [[Crows-an-Wra]]. St. Buryan is served by four bus routes. Services 1 and 1A run between [[Penzance]] and [[Land's End]] via [[Gwavas]], [[Sheffield, Cornwall|Sheffield]], St Buryan and [[Sennen]]. The 300 service runs a circular route via [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]], [[St Just in Penwith|St Just]], [[Sennen]], St Buryan and [[Newlyn]]. These routes are run by [[First Devon Cornwall|First Devon & Cornwall]], part of [[First Group]]. [[Western Greyhound]] service 501 runs on the same route as the 1/1A. Services run frequently from Penzance to the village until around 10&nbsp;pm during the summer months, but markedly less often in the winter.<ref>[http://www.firstgroup.com/ukbus/southwest/devon/search/resultsindex.php?results=516119,515797 Bus timetables]</ref> Travel by rail is via the [[Great Western Main Line]] whose westernmost terminus is located at nearby [[Penzance railway station|Penzance]].

==Amenities==
[[Image:StBuryanChurchtown.jpg|thumb|right|Churchtown in St Buryan with a view of the village shop]]
Commercial activity in St Buryan centres around Churchtown where a well stocked village store, run under a [[Londis]] [[Franchising|franchise]] and housing an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] cashpoint, plus a post office, an antiques shop and the St Buryan Inn are located. There is also a garage at the eastern end of the village that runs a limited coach service. The village was also previously served by its own butchers shop, this was closed in 1990 due to combination of the economic recession and pressure from the recently opened [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]](now Morrisons) supermarket in nearby [[Penzance]]. A doctor's branch surgery is currently held in the village cricket pavilion every Thursday between twelve and one pm. At other times patients must travel to the surgery in nearby [[St Just in Penwith|St Just]], the West Cornwall hospital in Penzance or the [[Royal Cornwall Hospital (Treliske)]], Truro.
