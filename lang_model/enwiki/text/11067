'''Lanny King McDonald''' (born February 16, 1953) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] former professional [[ice hockey]] player for the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)|Colorado Rockies]] and [[Calgary Flames]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).  He played over [[List of NHL players with 1000 games played|1,100&nbsp;games]] during a 16-year career in which he scored [[List of NHL players with 500 goals|500&nbsp;goals]] and over [[List of NHL players with 1000 points|1,000&nbsp;points]].  His total of 66&nbsp;goals in [[1982<U+2013>83 NHL season|1982<U+2013>83]] remains the Flames' franchise record.

McDonald was selected by the Maple Leafs as the fourth overall pick in the [[1973 NHL Amateur Draft]] and established himself as an offensive forward with three consecutive 40-goal seasons in Toronto in the mid-1970s. His trade to the Rockies in 1979 resulted in Toronto fans protesting the deal in front of [[Maple Leaf Gardens]].  He played parts of three seasons in Denver before he was sent to Calgary in 1981 where he spent the remainder of his career.  He [[Captain (ice hockey)|captained]] the Flames to a [[Stanley Cup]] championship in his final season of [[1988<U+2013>89 NHL season|1988<U+2013>89]].

He is among the most popular players in Flames history and his personality and bushy red moustache made him an iconic figure within the sport.  McDonald won the [[Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy]] for dedication and sportsmanship in 1983 and in 1988 was named the inaugural winner of the [[King Clancy Memorial Trophy]] for his leadership and humanitarian presence, in particular through his long association with the [[Special Olympics]].  Internationally, he represented [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] as a player on two occasions and in a management role three times.  He was a member of the inaugural [[Canada Cup]] championship team in [[1976 Canada Cup|1976]] and was director of player personnel of Canada's [[2004 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2004 World Championship]] winning team.  McDonald was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1992 and the [[Alberta Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1993.  The Flames [[List of NHL retired numbers|retired]] his uniform number 9 in 1990.

==Early life==
McDonald was born February 16, 1953, in [[Hanna, Alberta]].<ref name="CHRetire">{{citation |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Lanny hangs up skates |work=Calgary Herald |date=1989-08-29 |page=A1}}</ref> He is the youngest of four children after brother Lynn and sisters Donna and Dixie.<ref name="McDonald46">{{harvnb|McDonald|Simmons|1987|p=46}}</ref> His father, Lorne, tended the family farm near the hamlet of [[Craigmyle, Alberta|Craigmyle]], {{convert|35|km|mi}} outside Hanna.<ref name="LOHBio">{{citation |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p199204&page=bio&list=ByName |title=Lanny McDonald biography |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2011-10-11}}</ref>  The young Lanny viewed his father as his hero, often following Lorne around helping with whatever chores he could.

Learning to skate at the age of five, McDonald immediately developed a passion for hockey. He served as a stick boy, helping manage equipment, for his father's community team and grew up listening to radio broadcasts of ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]''.<ref name="McDonald49">{{harvnb|McDonald|Simmons|1987|p=49}}</ref> McDonald shared his father's passion for the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]; he was given his middle name, King, after Maple Leafs' star [[King Clancy]].<ref name="LOH1on1" />  He began playing organized hockey at the age of six and, despite both having full-time commitments, his parents drove him and Lynn to Hanna for their practices and games.  McDonald recalled that half of his time in youth hockey was spent in Hanna, and the other half in the car.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonald|Simmons|1987|p=50}}</ref>  He completed high school while playing in Lethbridge, choosing to remain with his [[junior ice hockey|junior A]] team in 1970<U+2013>71 rather than join the [[Medicine Hat Tigers]] of the [[Western Hockey League|Western Canada Hockey League]] (WCHL) so that he could complete his diploma.<ref name="McDonald56">{{harvnb|McDonald|Simmons|1987|p=56}}</ref>

==Playing career==

===Junior===
McDonald began his junior career in 1969 with the [[Lethbridge Sugar Kings]] of the tier II [[Alberta Junior Hockey League]] (AJHL).  He appeared in 34&nbsp;games for the Sugar Kings as a 16-year-old, scoring two goals.  The following season, 1970<U+2013>71, he emerged as a leading scorer, recording 37&nbsp;goals and 82&nbsp;[[point (ice hockey)|points]] in 45&nbsp;games.<ref name="LOHStats">{{citation |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p199204&page=statsawards&list=ByName |title=Lanny McDonald statistics |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2011-10-12}}</ref>  He was voted the league's most valuable player and named to the Second All-Star team.<ref name="LOHBio" /><ref name="McDonald56" /> Additionally, McDonald appeared in six WCHL games with the [[Calgary Centennials]].<ref name="LOHStats" />

The Medicine Hat Tigers acquired McDonald's playing rights in a [[trade (sports)|trade]] during the [[1970<U+2013>71 WCHL season]].<ref name="McDonald56" /> He joined the team the following year, finishing eighth in league scoring with 114&nbsp;points, including 50&nbsp;goals.<ref>{{harvnb|Flett|Watts|2009|p=188}}</ref> He improved to 62&nbsp;goals and 139&nbsp;points in [[1972<U+2013>73 WCHL season|1972<U+2013>73]] to finish third overall in league scoring and was named to the WCHL All-Star Team at [[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]].<ref name="LOHBio" />  McDonald added an additional 37&nbsp;points in the playoffs as the Tigers won the [[Ed Chynoweth Cup|league championship]].<ref>{{harvnb|Flett|Watts|2009|p=187}}</ref>

In McDonald's draft year of 1973, the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) was in competition with the rival [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) for talent.<ref name="Simmons23">{{harvnb|McDonald|Simmons|1987|p=23}}</ref> McDonald was considered a top junior prospect and was recruited by both leagues.<ref name="OCBankroll">{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bb0yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_ewFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5164,2774778 |title=Leafs open bankroll for western star |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=1973-06-06 |accessdate=2011-10-12 |page=17}}</ref> The [[Vancouver Canucks]] had the third overall selection in the [[1973 NHL Amateur Draft|NHL draft]] and were interested in drafting him, but opted against it when McDonald made it clear he would likely go to the WHA rather than play with Vancouver.  Instead, he went to the Toronto Maple Leafs with the fourth overall pick.<ref name="OCBankroll" /> In the [[1973 WHA Amateur Draft|WHA draft]], he was selected 10th overall by the [[Cleveland Crusaders]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=3544 |title=Lanny McDonald statistics |publisher=The Internet Hockey Database |accessdate=2011-10-12}}</ref> McDonald chose to play in the NHL, signing a contract with the Maple Leafs that was considered to be among the richest in the league.  The deal, worth between $175,000 and $200,000 per season,<ref name="OCBankroll" /> came as a result of the competition between the two leagues and McDonald found that some of the older players in Toronto resented him as a result.<ref name="Simmons23"/>

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
McDonald made his NHL debut with the Leafs on October 10, 1973, against the [[Buffalo Sabres]].  He assisted on two goals in the game, but also suffered a concussion and required several stitches after landing on his head as a result of a check by [[Rick Martin]].  Following the custom of most NHL players at the time, he played the game without wearing a helmet.  It was the only time in his career he did so, as he felt that his injury contributed to his early struggles in the NHL.<ref name="McDonald16">{{harvnb|McDonald|Simmons|1987|p=16}}</ref> McDonald scored his first NHL goal on October 17 against [[Michel Larocque (ice hockey b. 1952)|Michel Larocque]] of the [[Montreal Canadiens]],<ref name="RLPMachineGun">{{citation |last=Cole |first=Glenn |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0PJUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yjwNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1368,3811371 |title=Machine-Gun Lanny finds the target |work=Regina Leader-Post |date=1973-10-18 |accessdate=2011-10-14 |page=18}}</ref> but finished the season with only 14&nbsp;goals and 30&nbsp;points in [[1973<U+2013>74 NHL season|1973<U+2013>74]].<ref name="LOHStats" /> His continued inability to score early in the [[1974<U+2013>75 NHL season|1974<U+2013>75]] season nearly resulted in a trade.  [[Atlanta Flames]] general manager [[Cliff Fletcher]] sought to take advantage of the Maple Leafs' early disappointment in McDonald and agreed in principle to a trade for the young forward in exchange for [[Curt Bennett]].<ref name="Duhatschek35">{{harvnb|Duhatschek|Simmons|1986|pp=35<U+2013>36}}</ref>  However, McDonald scored three goals in his following two games causing Toronto to back out of the deal.<ref>{{harvnb|Duhatschek|Simmons|1986|p=37}}</ref>  McDonald recorded a modest improvement over his rookie campaign: 17&nbsp;goals and 44&nbsp;points.<ref name="LOHStats" />

The patience the Maple Leafs had shown McDonald in his first two seasons was rewarded in [[1975<U+2013>76 NHL season|1975<U+2013>76]] when he rediscovered his offensive touch, scoring 37&nbsp;goals and adding 56&nbsp;assists.<ref name="LOH1on1">{{citation |last=Shea |first=Kevin |url=http://www.hhof.com/htmlSpotlight/spot_oneononep199204.shtml |title=One on One with Lanny McDonald |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |date=2003-04-04 |accessdate=2011-10-12}}</ref>  Following the season, he earned an invite to the [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canadian national team's]] summer camp in advance of the [[1976 Canada Cup]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=e4xkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AoANAAAAIBAJ&pg=2598,3852543 |title=McDonald out to make team |work=Calgary Herald |date=1976-08-18 |accessdate=2011-10-12 |page=48}}</ref> McDonald was named to the roster, and appeared in five of Team Canada's seven games.

A 43-goal season in [[1976<U+2013>77 NHL season|1976<U+2013>77]] earned McDonald several accolades.  He was named to the [[Wales Conference]] team at the [[30th National Hockey League All-Star Game|1977 All-Star Game]] where he scored two goals in a 4<U+2013>3 victory over the [[Campbell Conference]]. He was also named a [[NHL All-Star Team|Second Team All-Star]] at right wing following the season.<ref name="OGHHOF">{{harvnb|Duplacey|Zweig|2010|p=337}}</ref> It was the first of three consecutive 40-goal seasons for McDonald,<ref name="LOHStats" /> and he finished in the top ten in NHL scoring in both [[1977<U+2013>78 NHL season|1977<U+2013>78]] and [[1978<U+2013>79 NHL season|1978<U+2013>79]].<ref name="LOH1on1" /> He appeared in his [[31st National Hockey League All-Star Game|second All-Star Game]] in 1978 and played for the NHL All-Stars in the [[1979 Challenge Cup]] against the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet national team]].<ref name="LOHBio" />

The highlight of McDonald's career in Toronto came in the [[1978 Stanley Cup playoffs]] against the [[New York Islanders]].  The Maple Leafs were viewed as [[Underdog (competition)|underdogs]] in the series against an Islanders team that was considered to be among the best in the league.  Toronto overcame a 2<U+2013>0 series deficit to force a seventh and deciding game.  Playing despite breaking both his wrist and nose  during the series,<ref>{{harvnb|McDonald|Simmons|1987|pp=36<U+2013>38}}</ref> McDonald scored the overtime winning goal that eliminated the Islanders and allowed the Maple Leafs to advance to the league semi-finals for the first time in 11&nbsp;years.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a5ZjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dXoNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1491,96932 |title=Toronto advances with overtime victory |work=Saskatoon Star-Phoenix |date=1978-05-01 |accessdate=2011-10-14 |page=13}}</ref> Toronto was then eliminated by Montreal, who swept the series with four consecutive victories.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lsJBAAAAIBAJ&sjid=B6oMAAAAIBAJ&pg=7195,1364365 |title=Canadiens gain finals with sweep of Toronto |work=The Telegraph-Herald |location=Dubuque, IA |date=1978-05-10 |accessdate=2012-04-02 |page=16}}</ref>

===Colorado Rockies===
[[Punch Imlach]] was named Toronto general manager prior to the [[1979<U+2013>80 NHL season|1979<U+2013>80 season]] and immediately clashed with team captain Darryl Sittler.<ref name="McDonald3">{{harvnb|McDonald|Simmons|1987|p=3}}</ref> Imlach wanted to move Sittler to another team, but the player refused to waive his no trade clause.  Imlach responded by trading teammates friendly to Sittler instead.<ref name="LOH1on1" /> On December 28, 1979, Imlach dealt McDonald to the [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)|Colorado Rockies]], along with [[Joel Quenneville]], in exchange for [[Wilf Paiement]] and [[Pat Hickey]].  The deal came as a surprise even to Toronto's head coach.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VJEjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=q6QFAAAAIBAJ&pg=842,2735437 |title=McDonald, Paiement key men in big trade |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1979-12-29 |accessdate=2011-10-14 |page=54}}</ref>

McDonald was devastated by the trade, particularly because he and his wife were expecting their second child and had just purchased a new house.  In his 1987 autobiography, he argued that Imlach made the trade out of spite.<ref name="McDonald3" />  McDonald had also come into conflict with Imlach while serving as the team's representative of the [[National Hockey League Players Association]] (NHLPA) when the general manager refused to honour an increase in the per diem paid to each player.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonald|Simmons|1987|p=4}}</ref> The trade outraged fans in Toronto, where McDonald was among the team's most popular players.  While fans picketed outside [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in protest, McDonald told the media that he felt fortunate to have been traded away from the unsettled situation the Leafs were in and blamed Imlach for the team's failures on the ice.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cnRkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QH4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=2464%2C4460792 |title=McDonald feels fortunate |work=Calgary Herald |date=1979-12-31 |accessdate=2011-10-14 |page=C3}}</ref>  Sittler resigned as the team's captain following the trade.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cnRkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QH4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=1207%2C4462828 |title=Sittler turns in 'C' amid Leaf turmoil |work=Calgary Herald |date=1979-12-31 |accessdate=2011-10-14 |page=C3}}</ref>

Arriving in Colorado, McDonald found himself at the centre of another power struggle. Sympathetic to the fact that his wife was less than two weeks away from giving birth, head coach [[Don Cherry]] gave McDonald permission to leave the team on off-days to return to his wife in Toronto. But he did so without gaining the approval of general manager [[Ray Miron]], who disagreed frequently with Cherry and fired him following the season.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonald|Simmons|1987|p=84}}</ref> On the ice, McDonald scored 35&nbsp;goals with the Rockies and finished with a total of 40 between the two teams.<ref name="LOHStats" />

Rumours circulated following the season that Maple Leafs owner [[Harold Ballard]] had told the media that he was attempting to reacquire McDonald.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=U71jAAAAIBAJ&sjid=k3oNAAAAIBAJ&pg=945,3202024 |title=Leafs want McDonald back |work=Saskatoon Star-Phoenix |date=1980-09-10 |accessdate=2011-10-14 |page=E10}}</ref>  The Rockies disputed that any such negotiations had taken place and Ballard quickly apologized for the news story after Colorado threatened to file tampering charges against the Maple Leafs' owner.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dZckAAAAIBAJ&sjid=raQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5985,106093 |title=Ballard apologizes for McDonald story |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1980-09-11 |accessdate=2011-10-14 |page=21}}</ref>  McDonald served as the Rockies' captain, and scored 35&nbsp;goals and 81&nbsp;points in [[1980<U+2013>81 NHL season|1980<U+2013>81]], his only full season with the team.<ref name="LOH1on1" />

===Calgary Flames===
Stating that his team needed to add character and leadership, Cliff Fletcher finally completed a trade for McDonald seven years after his first attempt. McDonald was acquired by the [[Calgary Flames]], along with a draft pick, in exchange for [[Bob MacMillan]] and [[Don Lever]] on November 25, 1981.<ref name="CSRockiesTrade">{{citation |last=Simmons |first=Steve |title=A McWhopper! |work=Calgary Sun |date=1981-11-26 |page=38}}</ref>  The deal occurred one day after the last place Rockies lost to the Flames by a 9<U+2013>2 score.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DkZhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UHANAAAAIBAJ&pg=1360%2C3703975 |title=Statistical story |work=Saskatoon Star-Phoenix |date=1981-11-25 |accessdate=2013-08-01 |page=D8}}</ref> Once the team's plane landed in Winnipeg, McDonald was informed of the trade and told to return to Calgary.<ref name="BestOfAlberta">{{citation |last=Cruickshank |first=Scott |url=http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/features/greatest/story.html?id=30883dfa-acbd-45c7-b515-6c4e1e9de485 |title=Lanny McDonald: The man behind the moustache |work=Calgary Herald |accessdate=2011-10-16}}</ref>  Angered at first, he viewed the deal as an insult, that the worst team in the NHL had rejected him.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonald|Simmons|1987|p=97}}</ref>

McDonald also felt the pressure of having to replace two popular ex-Flames in MacMillan and Lever while also working to overcome a separated shoulder he suffered earlier in the year with the Rockies.<ref name="McDonald102">{{harvnb|McDonald|Simmons|1987|pp=102<U+2013>103}}</ref> He made his debut with the Flames the following night, a 7<U+2013>1 victory over the [[Los Angeles Kings]], after which McDonald remarked that it was the most fun he had playing the game in a long time.<ref>{{citation |last=Simmons |first=Steve |title=Kings get crowned |work=Calgary Sun |date=1981-11-27 |page=58}}</ref> He was given a loud ovation by the fans who immediately embraced him as a local hero,<ref>{{harvnb|McDonald|Simmons|1987|p=109}}</ref> even though it took him seven games before he scored his first goal as a member of the Flames.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonald|Simmons|1987|p=104}}</ref> He scored 34&nbsp;goals in Calgary, and combined with the 6 scored in Colorado, finished with his fifth 40-goal campaign in six years.<ref name="LOHStats" />

McDonald denied claims from team sources that he was upset at not gaining a new role when Button was hired. He stated that after "nineteen great years here in one organization", it was the right time to retire.<ref>{{citation |last=Tucker |first=Larry |title=McDonald to retire |work=Calgary Herald |date=2000-08-09 |page=E1}}</ref> He retained a small role in the organization, serving as a board member of the [[Scotiabank Saddledome#Saddledome Foundation|Saddledome Foundation]].<ref>{{citation |last=Tucker |first=Larry |title=Flames lament loss of Lanny |work=Calgary Herald |date=2000-08-10 |page=C3}}</ref>

==Playing style==

McDonald was known primarily as an offensive player with a hard shot.<ref name="LOHBio" /> His [[wrist shot]] was considered to be effective,<ref name="198283Profile" /> and his scoring exploits in junior hockey earned him the nickname "Machine-Gun Lanny".<ref name="RLPMachineGun" /> [[Red Kelly]], McDonald's coach in his first NHL seasons, recalled that he was impressed with his young player's skill handling the puck and defended McDonald against critics who wanted him moved out of Toronto due to his early struggles.<ref>{{citation |last=Johnson |first=George |title=Red Kelly's kind of guy |work=Calgary Sun |date=1989-08-29 |page=LM4}}</ref> In his NHL career, McDonald led his team in goal scoring six times: [[1976<U+2013>77 Toronto Maple Leafs season|1976<U+2013>77]], [[1977<U+2013>78 Toronto Maple Leafs season|1977<U+2013>78]] and [[1978<U+2013>79 Toronto Maple Leafs season|1978<U+2013>79]] with Toronto,<ref>{{harvnb|Park|2011|p=297}}</ref> [[1980<U+2013>81 Colorado Rockies season|1980<U+2013>81]] with Colorado,<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0001371981.html |title=1980<U+2013>81 Colorado Rockies |publisher=The Internet Hockey Database |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref> and [[1981<U+2013>82 Calgary Flames season|1981<U+2013>82]] and [[1982<U+2013>83 Calgary Flames season|1982<U+2013>83]] in Calgary.<ref>{{harvnb|Hanlon|Kelso|2007|pp=129<U+2013>130}}</ref> He was also a physical player, willing to play a hard-hitting style in the corners.<ref name="LOHBio" />

As age and injuries took their toll, McDonald's role with the Flames changed.

==Legacy==
The Flames arrived in Calgary after relocating from Atlanta for the 1980<U+2013>81 season. The organization entered a transitional phase, as many players used to the warm weather and relaxed atmosphere of Atlanta were unable or unwilling to adapt to the higher expectations fans in Calgary placed on them. [[David Poile]], then Flames assistant general manager, stated that the team had an identity crisis as a result.<ref name="CHDuhaLannyRetire">{{citation |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Lanny: No. 9 heads off the ice |work=Calgary Herald |date=1989-08-29 |page=A5}}</ref>  It was in this atmosphere that General Manager Cliff Fletcher made the trade for McDonald on November 25, 1981, claiming that McDonald added two characteristics the Flames lacked: character and leadership.<ref name="CSRockiesTrade" />

McDonald's arrival in Calgary was considered a turning point for the organization, one where his personality, demeanor and on-ice play came to define the Flames in the 1980s.<ref name="CSFranchiseMaker">{{citation |last=Simmons |first=Steve |title=Franchise maker |work=Calgary Sun |date=1989-08-29 |page=LM12}}</ref>  Poile argued that it signaled the true beginning of the team in its new market: "The trade for Lanny McDonald was the start of the Calgary Flames franchise.  It gave us that Calgary identity, that Western Canadian flavor."<ref name="CHDuhaLannyRetire" />  Columnist and co-author of McDonald's autobiography, [[Steve Simmons]], agreed. He added that the personal and professional disappointments McDonald endured in Toronto and Colorado resulted in his gaining a greater appreciation of both the game and himself.<ref name="CSFranchiseMaker" />  McDonald was extremely popular with his teammates and the fans wherever he played,<ref>{{Citation |last=Vincent |first=Gord |title='A class guy' |work=Calgary Sun |date=1989-08-29 |page=LM2}}</ref> as well as with the media <U+2013> he was named Colorado's athlete of the year in 1980 by the state's sportswriters.<ref name="198283Profile" />

Renowned for his leadership ability, McDonald cultivated the respect of the team's younger players.  He came into the NHL at a time when the battle with the rival WHA for talent led to rookies signing for far more money than the previous generation of players commanded.  Consequently, McDonald faced the resentment of several of Toronto's veteran players and resolved to show greater respect to those that followed him.<ref>{{citation |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=McDonald was an inspiration to young players |work=Calgary Herald |date=1989-08-29 |page=A5}}</ref> His efforts left a lasting impression on his peers;<ref>{{citation |last=Johnson |first=George |title=Nothing silly about this hero |work=Calgary Sun |date=1989-08-29 |page=LM6}}</ref> among them was [[Tiger Williams]] who called McDonald "a great ambassador" for the NHL.<ref>{{citation |last=Johnson |first=George |title=Some Tiger tails |work=Calgary Sun |date=1989-08-29 |page=LM10}}</ref>

His giant, walrus-style moustache is McDonald's most defining physical characteristic and helped him become an iconic figure in the sport.<ref name="OGHHOF" />  He developed it in 1974, spending the summer seeing what kind of beard he could grow.
