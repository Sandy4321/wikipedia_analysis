The '''''Kashin'' class destroyers''' were a group of guided missile [[destroyer]]s built for the [[Soviet Navy]] in the 1960s and early 1970s.  Their Soviet designation was Project 61. As of 2007, one ship is in service with the Russian Navy, and five modified ships are in service with the [[Indian Navy]] as [[Rajput class destroyer|''Rajput'' class destroyer]]s.

In the USSR they were officially classified as "guard ships" (''storozhevoi korabl'' - SKR), then "large [[Anti-submarine warfare|ASW]] ships" (BPK) or "large missile ships" (BRK), but in the rest of world they are commonly regarded as missile destroyers due to their size and armament. They were the first Soviet purpose-built [[anti-air warfare]] ships and the first to carry an ASW helicopter. 

==Design==
The design specification was approved in 1957; the first ship was laid down in 1959 and commissioned in 1962.  Much new equipment was developed for these ships, including surface-to-air missiles, [[radar]]s and [[gas turbine]] engines. The gas turbines were arranged in two separate spaces and could be removed via the funnels for servicing. These were also the first Soviet ships designed to be closed down for nuclear fallout and had an operations room deep inside the ship rather than a large bridge.

Six ships were modernised in the 1970s as the Project 61M or 61MP ([[Kashin-Mod class destroyer|''Kashin-Mod'']]), by being fitted with four [[SS-N-2]]C Styx anti-ship missiles, new towed-array [[sonar]], a raised [[helipad]] and four close range [[AK-630]] Gatling guns. The two [[RBU-1000]] ASW rocket launchers were mounted aft, but later removed.

The ''Smetlivy'' was modernised (mk01090) in [[Mykolaiv]] in the early 1990s and fitted with new [[Kh-35]] (SS-N-25 Switchblade, ''Harpoonski'') anti-shipping missiles and [[MNK-300]] sonar. She is the only ''Kashin'' currently active in the [[Russian Navy]].

The [[Rajput class destroyer|''Rajput'' class]] modification built for Indian Navy has the after gun turret replaced by a hangar for a helicopter, as well as SS-N-2C anti-ship missiles on the sides of the bridge.

==Ships==

In all, twenty ships were built for the [[Soviet Navy]], one ship ([[ORP Warszawa (271)|ORP ''Warszawa'' (271)]]) was later transferred to [[Poland]], while five similar ships were built to a modified design for the [[Indian Navy]] as the [[Rajput Class destroyers|''Rajput'' class destroyers]].
