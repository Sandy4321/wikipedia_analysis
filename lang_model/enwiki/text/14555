'''U.S.&nbsp;Route&nbsp;15''' ('''US&nbsp;15''') is a part of the [[U.S. Highway System]] that runs from [[Walterboro, South Carolina]] to [[Painted Post, New York]].  In [[Maryland]], the highway runs {{convert|37.85|mi|km}} from the [[Virginia]] state line at the [[Potomac River]] in [[Point of Rocks, Maryland|Point of Rocks]] north to the [[Pennsylvania]] state line near [[Emmitsburg, Maryland|Emmitsburg]].  US&nbsp;15 is the primary north&ndash;south highway of [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]].  The highway connects the [[county seat]] of [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]] with Point of Rocks and [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]] to the south and with [[Thurmont, Maryland|Thurmont]], Emmitsburg, and [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]] to the north.  US&nbsp;15 is a four-lane divided highway throughout the state except for the portion between the '''Point of Rocks Bridge''' and the highway's junction with [[U.S. Route 340 in Maryland|US&nbsp;340]] near [[Jefferson, Maryland|Jefferson]].  The U.S. Highway is a freeway along its [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with US&nbsp;340 and through Frederick, where the highway meets [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|US&nbsp;40]] and [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|Interstate&nbsp;70]] (I-70).

US&nbsp;15 is the descendent of a pair of turnpikes that connected Frederick with Emmitsburg to the north and [[Buckeystown, Maryland|Buckeystown]] to the south.  These turnpikes were reconstructed as state roads in the 1910s north of Frederick and in the early 1920s from Frederick south to [[Tuscarora, Maryland|Tuscarora]].  When US&nbsp;15 was assigned in 1927, the Tuscarora &ndash; Point of Rocks highway had yet to be improved; this section was paved in the early 1930s.  The modern Point of Rocks Bridge was built in the late 1930s after its predecessor was destroyed in a flood.  The Frederick Freeway was constructed in the 1950s.  US&nbsp;15 was relocated to part of the freeway; the old route of the U.S. Highway through downtown Frederick became part of [[Maryland&nbsp;Route&nbsp;355]] (MD&nbsp;355).  US&nbsp;15's present highway between Point of Rocks and Jefferson was constructed in the late 1960s; the old road south of Frederick was replaced with [[Maryland Route 28|MD&nbsp;28]] and [[Maryland Route 85|MD&nbsp;85]].  North of Frederick, the U.S. Highway bypassed Thurmont and Emmitsburg in the late 1950s and mid-1960s, respectively.  US&nbsp;15 was upgraded to a divided highway north of Frederick in the early 1980s.

==Route description==
US&nbsp;15 has several official designations throughout its course in Maryland.  The U.S. Highway is known as '''Catoctin Mountain Highway''' from the Virginia state line at Point of Rocks north to US &nbsp;340 near Jefferson and from MD&nbsp;26 in Frederick north to the Pennsylvania state line near Emmitsburg.  US&nbsp;15 is also part of Jefferson National Pike along its freeway concurrency with US&nbsp;340 and the Frederick Freeway between US&nbsp;340 and MD&nbsp;26.<ref name="Frederick HLR"/>  In July 2004, the [[Maryland General Assembly]] designated the highway the 115th Infantry Regiment Memorial Highway; a marker honoring the [[115th Infantry Regiment (United States)|115th Infantry Regiment]] was completed in the median of US&nbsp;15 in Emmitsburg in July 2006.<ref name="FNP 115th"/>  All of US&nbsp;15 except the portion between [[Catoctin Furnace, Maryland|Catoctin Furnace]] and Thurmont is part of the '''Catoctin Mountain Scenic Byway''', which was designated a [[National Scenic Byway]] in September 2005.<ref name="Maryland Byways"/><ref name="FNP National Scenic Byway"/>  The entire length of the highway in Maryland is part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]].<ref name="National Highway System"/>

===Point of Rocks to Frederick===
US&nbsp;15 enters Maryland at Point of Rocks, named for the pair of mountain peaks between which the Potomac River cuts through [[Catoctin Mountain]], Pine Rock in Maryland and [[Furnace Mountain (Virginia)|Furnace Mountain]] in [[Loudoun County, Virginia]].  The highway crosses the river on the Point of Rocks Bridge, a two-lane, eight-span [[camelback truss]] bridge that also passes over the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] and [[CSX Transportation|CSX]]'s [[Metropolitan Subdivision]] on the Maryland side of the river.  Just north of the bridge, US&nbsp;15 meets the western terminus of MD&nbsp;28 (Clay Street), which serves as the main street of the community of Point of Rocks.  The U.S. Highway heads north as a two-lane controlled-access road that passes through a mix of farmland and forest on the eastern flank of Catoctin Mountain.  North of its [[roundabout]] at [[Maryland Route 464|MD&nbsp;464]] (Point of Rocks Road), US&nbsp;15 has only two intersections, with Basford Road and Mountville Road, before passing under Elmer Derr Road and reaching a partial interchange with US&nbsp;340 (Jefferson National Pike) east of Jefferson.  There is no direct access from northbound US&nbsp;15 to westbound US&nbsp;340 or from eastbound US&nbsp;340 to southbound US&nbsp;15.<ref name="Frederick HLR"/><ref name="Google Maps US 15 MD"/>

[[File:Point_of_rocks_8501.jpg|left|thumb|Riverside view from the Maryland side of the Point of Rocks Bridge, which carries US&nbsp;15 across the Potomac River at Point of Rocks]]
US&nbsp;15 and US&nbsp;340 run concurrently northeast toward Frederick as a four-lane freeway.  The two highways have a [[diamond interchange]] with Mt. Zion Road and cross over [[Ballenger Creek]].  On the southwest side of Frederick, the freeway has a partial interchange with I-70 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway), a folded diamond interchange with [[Maryland Route 180|MD&nbsp;180]] (Jefferson Pike), and a [[partial cloverleaf interchange]] with the Frederick Freeway, which carries US&nbsp;40 through the interchange.  US&nbsp;340's eastern terminus is within the third interchange, where US&nbsp;15 exits north onto the Frederick Freeway and Jefferson Street continues east toward downtown Frederick.<ref name="Frederick HLR"/><ref name="Google Maps US 15 MD"/>

US&nbsp;15 continues north concurrent with US&nbsp;40 along the six-lane Frederick Freeway.  US&nbsp;40 exits the freeway at a partial cloverleaf interchange with Patrick Street, which heads east toward downtown Frederick and west through the heavily commercialized Golden Mile.  US&nbsp;15 crosses [[Carroll Creek]] and continues north with four lanes through folded diamond interchanges with Rosemont Avenue, 7th Street, and Motter Avenue.  All three streets provide access to [[Fort Detrick]], home of the [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]].  In addition, Rosemont Avenue leads to [[Hood College]] and Motter Avenue connects the freeway with [[Frederick Community College]].  The Frederick Freeway ends at US&nbsp;15's partial interchange with [[Maryland Route 26|MD&nbsp;26]] (Liberty Road).<ref name="Frederick HLR"/><ref name="Google Maps US 15 MD"/>

===Frederick to Emmitsburg===
US&nbsp;15 continues north as a four-lane controlled-access expressway that has directional crossover intersections with Hayward Road and Monocacy Boulevard before leaving the city of Frederick by crossing [[Tuscarora Creek (Monocacy River)|Tuscarora Creek]].  The highway parallels the [[Monocacy River]] and has a junction with Biggs Ford Road on its way north to the hamlet of Hansonville, where the U.S. Highway intersects Old Frederick Road.  US&nbsp;15 crosses Fishing Creek to the west of [[Lewistown, Frederick County, Maryland|Lewistown]] and is closely paralleled on the west by Auburn Road as the highway gradually approaches the eastern flank of Catoctin Mountain.  At the northern end of Auburn Road, [[Maryland Route 806|MD&nbsp;806]] (Catoctin Furnace Road) begins to parallel the northbound side of the U.S. Highway, which follows the eastern boundary of [[Cunningham Falls State Park]] just west of the village of Catoctin Furnace.  Access to the main section of the state park is provided by Catoctin Hollow Road, which intersects the southbound lanes of US&nbsp;15 and follows Little Hunting Creek up the mountain.  The park's Manor Area is accessible from US&nbsp;15 a short distance north of Catoctin Hollow Road.<ref name="Frederick HLR"/><ref name="Google Maps US 15 MD"/>

North of its intersection with Blue Mountain Road and Pryor Road, US&nbsp;15 leaves the park boundary and enters the town of Thurmont.  The U.S. Highway has a diamond interchange with unnamed and [[unsigned highway|unsigned]] MD&nbsp;15C that leads to the northern end of MD&nbsp;806 and to Frederick Road, which serves a commercial area south of downtown Thurmont.  US&nbsp;15 continues north to a folded diamond interchange with [[Maryland Route 77|MD&nbsp;77]] (Main Street) where the highway also crosses Hunting Creek; MD&nbsp;77 follows the creek up the mountain as Foxville Road toward [[Catoctin Mountain Park]].  The highway intersects Sandy Spring Lane (unsigned MD&nbsp;15D) and crosses over the [[Maryland Midland Railroad]].  US&nbsp;15 leaves the town of Thurmont and meets [[Maryland Route 550|MD&nbsp;550]] (Church Street) at a diamond interchange before crossing Owens Creek, which MD&nbsp;550 follows up the mountain as Sabillasville Road.  The U.S. Highway heads northeast through farmland and meets the northern end of [[Maryland Route 76|MD&nbsp;76]] (Motters Station Road) before bisecting the campus of [[Mount St. Mary's University]].  The main part of the campus and National Shrine Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes are located to the west of the highway; the athletic complex, which includes [[Knott Arena]], is to the east.<ref name="Frederick HLR"/><ref name="Google Maps US 15 MD"/>

North of Mount St. Mary's University, US&nbsp;15 meets the southern end of unsigned [[U.S. Route 15 Business (Emmitsburg, Maryland)|US&nbsp;15&nbsp;Business]] (Seton Avenue) at a directional crossover intersection that also serves Old Frederick Road; U-turn ramps on either side of the intersection provide the missing movements.  The U.S. Highway crosses Toms Creek and Flat Run along the eastern side of the town of Emmitsburg before its interchange with [[Maryland Route 140|MD&nbsp;140]] (Main Street).  MD&nbsp;140 is accessed via a pair of [[right-in/right-out]] interchanges with Emmit Gardens Drive, which is unsigned [[Maryland Route 904|MD&nbsp;904H]] on the northbound side of US&nbsp;15 and MD&nbsp;904F on the southbound side.  North of MD&nbsp;140, the southbound direction of US&nbsp;15 has a [[welcome center]], the Mason and Dixon Discovery Center.<ref name="FNP Welcome Center"/>  US&nbsp;15's last intersection in Maryland is with the northern end of US&nbsp;15&nbsp;Business (Seton Avenue) and Welty Road, which leads to Old Gettysburg Road; there is no direct access from northbound US&nbsp;15&nbsp;Business to northbound US&nbsp;15.  North of the intersection, US&nbsp;15 becomes a freeway that continues across the Pennsylvania state line as the U.S. highway's bypass of Gettysburg.<ref name="Frederick HLR"/><ref name="Google Maps US 15 MD"/>

==History==
When the U.S. Highway System was laid out in 1926, US&nbsp;15 did not enter Maryland.  [[U.S. Route 240|US&nbsp;240]] followed US&nbsp;15's current corridor from Frederick north to near [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]].  No U.S. Highway connected Frederick and Leesburg via Point of Rocks.<ref name="1926 US Highway Map"/>  By the end of 1927, US&nbsp;240 was reduced to a Washington&ndash;Frederick highway and US&nbsp;15 connected Point of Rocks and Emmitsburg via Frederick as it does today.<ref name="1927 map"/>

===Original construction and early improvements===
US&nbsp;15 was established partially along what had been a pair of turnpikes.  The Frederick and Emmitsburg Turnpike connected Emmitsburg with Worman's Mill, which was located at the northern end of Market Street at MD&nbsp;26 on the north side of Frederick.  The Frederick and Buckeystown Turnpike ran from its co-terminus with the Frederick and Monocacy Turnpike at Evergreen Point at what is today the junction of MD&nbsp;85 and MD&nbsp;355, south to {{convert|1|mi|km}} south of Buckeystown.<ref name="Report on the Highways of Maryland"/>  When the [[Maryland State Highway Administration|Maryland State Roads Commission]] (MDSRC) designated highways to be improved as part of a state road system in 1909, the Frederick&ndash;Emmitsburg highway was included in the new system.  MDSRC originally planned to build the state road north from the city of Frederick along the Frederick and Opossumtown Turnpike, then turn east along Hayward Road to meet the Frederick and Emmitsburg Turnpike at Harmony Grove.<ref name="1910 map"/>

MDSRC purchased the Frederick and Emmitsburg Turnpike from its operating company in 1911.<ref name="1911 src report"/>  The first section of the turnpike to be rebuilt as a modern road was between Tuscarora Creek north of Frederick and just north of Sundays Lane near Hansonville in 1911.<ref name="1911 map"/>  The old turnpike was resurfaced as a {{convert|14|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} macadam road from Lewistown to Thurmont in 1914 and from Harmony Grove to Lewistown in 1915.  The Gettysburg Road from Emmitsburg to the Pennsylvania state line was also paved in 1915.<ref name="1915 src report"/>  The gaps between Thurmont and Emmitsburg and between the city of Frederick and Harmony Grove were resurfaced between 1915 and 1919; the Frederick &ndash; Harmony Grove road followed the turnpike [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] north from Worman's Mill rather than the 1910 planned route via Opossumtown Pike.<ref name="1919 src report"/><ref name="1921 map"/>

The right-of-way of the Frederick and Buckeystown Turnpike was resurfaced with macadam by 1921.<ref name="1921 map"/>  The remainder of Buckeystown Pike was paved as a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} concrete road from south of Buckeystown to around Lily Pons Road in 1918 and 1919 and south of Lily Pons Road to just north of the modern MD&nbsp;28 junction in Tuscarora by 1921.<ref name="1919 src report"/><ref name="1921 map"/>  The concrete highway was extended south through the MD&nbsp;28 junction to modern MD&nbsp;28's junction with Nolands Ferry Road by 1923.  That same year, Emmitsburg Pike was paved through Thurmont.<ref name="1923 map"/>  In 1926, MDSRC assumed maintenance of and resurfaced Market Street with asphalt from the city of Frederick between the south city limit at New Design Road (now Stadium Drive) to the north city limit at 9th Street.  The commission also replaced Buckeystown Pike's [[covered bridge]] at Ballenger Creek with the modern concrete arch bridge that year.<ref name="1926 src report"/>  US&nbsp;15 was widened to a width of {{convert|20|ft|m}} from Frederick to the Pennsylvania state line around 1930.<ref name="1930 src report"/>  The highway from Tuscarora to Point of Rocks was constructed as a concrete road in three stages starting in 1929, when the paved highway was extended west from Nolands Ferry Road to west of New Design Road.<ref name="1930 src report"/><ref name="1930 map"/>  The second section of the new highway was started in 1930.<ref name="1930 src report"/>  The third segment was finished in 1933, which completed the paving of US&nbsp;15 in Maryland.<ref name="1934 src report"/><ref name="1933 map"/>  Around 1938, the U.S. Highway was resurfaced with asphalt from Emmitsburg to the Pennsylvania state line and from the south end of Frederick to Evergreen Point; in addition, a grade separation was constructed with the [[Western Maryland Railway]] in Thurmont.<ref name="1938 src report"/>

===Point of Rocks Bridge===
Several ferries crossed the Potomac River at Point of Rocks before the first bridge was constructed there in 1852.  This wooden bridge was constructed to carry a double-track narrow gauge railroad from a junction with the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] to a blast furnace to process the area's iron ore.<ref name="Iron Mining"/>  This bridge, which also carried wagons and horses, was destroyed on June 9, 1861 by [[Confederate States Army|Confederate forces]] under General [[Turner Ashby]], the same day the bridge at Brunswick was destroyed.<ref name="Iron Mining"/><ref name="Brunswick History"/>  The second bridge at Point of Rocks was an iron bridge constructed in 1889.<ref name="Iron Bridge"/>  US&nbsp;15 originally followed Commerce Street and Canal Road, which is now used to access the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, through an at-grade crossing of the B&O Railroad to the Maryland end of the bridge, which crossed the river immediately to the east of the modern bridge.<ref name="USGS 1910 Antietam"/>  The 1889 iron bridge was swept away in the [[Pittsburgh Flood of 1936|March 1936 flood]] that also destroyed the Potomac River crossings at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]], [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia|Shepherdstown]], and [[Hancock, Maryland|Hancock]].<ref name="1936 Flood"/>

In November 1936, MDSRC put together a plan to replace the Potomac River bridges at Hancock, Shepherdstown, and Point of Rocks.<ref name="Three Bridge Plan"/>  The Point of Rocks Bridge became the first of the three crossings to be started when construction began March 25, 1937; the bridge's concrete piers were completed and the piers of the old bridge were removed from the river by September of that year.<ref name="Bridge Progress"/>  The new bridge and its approaches, which crossed over the B&O Railroad on the Maryland side, opened December 26, 1937.<ref name="Bridge Opens"/>  The camelback truss bridge spans {{convert|1689|ft|m}} and has a {{convert|24|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} roadway and a pair of {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} sidewalks.  US&nbsp;15 followed a temporary approach to the new bridge along Commerce Street that remained vulnerable to major floods.<ref name="1938 src report"/>  The U.S. Highway was moved to higher ground on Clay Street when the highway was reconstructed and widened from Point of Rocks to Tuscarora in 1949.<ref name="1950 src report"/>

===Relocation through Frederick===
The first relocation of US&nbsp;15 north of Frederick occurred at Tuscarora Creek between 1950 and 1952.<ref name="1952 src report"/>  Construction on Washington National Pike, which is now I-270, began in 1950.<ref name="1950 src report"/>  The highway's cloverleaf interchange with US&nbsp;15, which would serve as the freeway's northern terminus for several years, was built in 1952 and 1953.  The adjacent portion of US&nbsp;15 from Evergreen Point south to Lime Kiln was relocated, reconstructed, and widened in 1951 and 1952.<ref name="1952 src report"/><ref name="1954 src report"/>  In 1954, US&nbsp;240 was moved to Washington National Pike; the old alignment became US&nbsp;240&nbsp;Alternate and then MD&nbsp;355 in 1956.<ref name="1954 map"/><ref name="1956 map"/>  The section of freeway from US&nbsp;15 to the Frederick Freeway was built between 1954 and 1956 concurrent with the first section of the Frederick Freeway.<ref name="1954 src report"/><ref name="1956 src report"/>  The original interchange between the Frederick Freeway and Washington National Pike included two ramps between the north&ndash;south and east&ndash;west portions of the Frederick Freeway.<ref name="1956 src report"/>

The first section of the Frederick Freeway opened from US&nbsp;40 (now MD&nbsp;144) east of Frederick to a temporary half-cloverleaf interchange with Patrick Street in 1956; this section featured a cloverleaf interchange with US&nbsp;340.<ref name="1956 map"/>  The remainder of the Frederick Freeway from Patrick Street to MD&nbsp;26 was placed under construction in 1956.<ref name="1956 src report"/><ref name="1958 src report"/>  The highway was constructed as a two-lane freeway from just south of its interchange with Rosemont Avenue to its northern end near Hayward Road, where the freeway tied into existing US&nbsp;15 at Harmony Grove.  The freeway north of Patrick Street featured interchanges with Rosemont Avenue, Motter Avenue, and a westward extension of MD&nbsp;26.  When the Frederick Freeway opened in 1959, US&nbsp;15 was moved to Washington National Pike north of Buckeystown Pike and north through Frederick along the Frederick Freeway.<ref name="1959 map"/>  Market Street north of Evergreen Point through downtown Frederick to US&nbsp;15 north of the city became a northward extension of MD&nbsp;355; the section of Buckeystown Pike from the freeway to Evergreen Point became a section of MD&nbsp;806.<ref name="1959 map"/><ref name="1964 map"/>

In 1960, US&nbsp;15 from the MD&nbsp;26 interchange to Harmony Grove was expanded to a divided highway.<ref name="1960 map"/>  The Frederick Freeway gained exit numbers in 1965, the same year the highway's interchange with 7th Street was added.<ref name="1965 map"/>  The exit numbers ranged from 1 at the freeway's interchange with MD&nbsp;144 east of Frederick to 9 at the highway's interchange with MD&nbsp;26; the 7th Street interchange became exit 7A.<ref name="1966 map"/>  The two-lane section of the freeway was expanded to its present four-lane configuration in 1969, the same year the US&nbsp;340 freeway was completed between Jefferson and Frederick.<ref name="1969 map"/>  US&nbsp;15's present alignment from Point of Rocks to US&nbsp;340 was also under construction by 1969.<ref name="1969 map"/>  When the new highway opened in 1970, US&nbsp;15 was moved to the new highway and joined US&nbsp;340 in a concurrency along Jefferson National Pike from Jefferson to the Frederick Freeway.  The old section of US&nbsp;15 from Point of Rocks to Tuscarora became a westward extension of MD&nbsp;28.<ref name="1970 map"/>  Buckeystown Pike from MD&nbsp;28 to Washington National Pike was designated MD&nbsp;85, which was extended north to MD&nbsp;355 the following year.<ref name="1970 map"/><ref name="1971 map"/>  The U.S. Highway's interchange with Mt. Zion Road opened in 1972.<ref name="1972 map"/>

===Bypasses and expansion north of Frederick===
US&nbsp;15 was widened from downtown Thurmont north to Owens Creek starting in 1953.  That same year, the highway was relocated as the first carriageway of an ultimate divided highway from Owens Creek to just south of the intersection of US&nbsp;15 with St. Anthony and Orndorff roads south of Mount St. Mary's University.<ref name="1954 src report"/>  In 1956, construction began on the Thurmont Bypass, which was constructed as the first carriageway of an ultimate divided highway from south of Catoctin Furnace to just south of Owens Creek.<ref name="1956 src report"/>  The bypass, which included an interchange with MD&nbsp;77, was completed in 1958.<ref name="1956 src report"/><ref name="1958 map"/>  The MD&nbsp;77 interchange originally consisted of one two-way ramp in the northeast quadrant of the junction.<ref name="USGS 1981 Topo"/>  The old alignment of US&nbsp;15 through Catoctin Furnace and Thurmont was designated MD&nbsp;806 by 1960.<ref name="1960 map"/>  US&nbsp;15's interchange with MD&nbsp;550 was built in 1972.<ref name="1972 map"/>

Several other sections of US&nbsp;15 were bypassed in the 1960s.  The highway bypassed Lewistown in 1962, leaving behind its old alignment of Hessong Bridge Road and Angleberger Road, which became a section of MD&nbsp;806.<ref name="1962 map"/>  Construction on the U.S. Highway's bypass of Emmitsburg began in 1963.<ref name="1963 map"/>  The following year, the portion of US&nbsp;15 from the northern end of the bypass to the Pennsylvania state line opened contemporaneously with US&nbsp;15's bypass of Gettysburg.<ref name="1964 map"/>  The Emmitsburg bypass was completed in 1965; the old road through the town was designated US&nbsp;15&nbsp;Business by 1967.<ref name="1967 map"/>  MD&nbsp;140's overpass of US&nbsp;15 was constructed in 1971; the old alignment of MD&nbsp;140 was used for interchange ramps between the two highways.<ref name="NBI MD 140 over US 15"/>

US&nbsp;15 was expanded to a divided highway north of Frederick between 1972 and 1985.<ref name="NBI NB Tuscarora Creek"/>  The U.S. Highway was expanded to four lanes from MD&nbsp;355 at Harmony Grove to Angleberger Road in Lewistown in 1973.<ref name="1973 map"/>  Four-laning of US&nbsp;15 continued in 1981 when the highway was expanded from the intersection with St. Anthony and Orndorff roads south of Mount St. Mary's University to just south of the Pennsylvania state line near Emmitsburg.<ref name="1981 map"/>  This section of divided highway was extended south through the MD&nbsp;550 interchange in 1983.<ref name="1983 map"/>  As part of this project, the oblique intersection with MD&nbsp;806 on the north side of Thurmont was removed.  MD&nbsp;806 was moved onto Albert Staub Road, which was extended north over a new crossing of Owens Creek to its present terminus at Roddy Creek Road, where local traffic could access US&nbsp;15 at a perpendicular intersection.<ref name="USGS 1981 Topo"/><ref name="NBI 806 Owens Creek"/><ref name="USGS 1988 Aerial"/>  The two-lane highway between Lewistown and MD&nbsp;550 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway in 1985.<ref name="1985 map"/>  The MD&nbsp;77 interchange was completed with the construction of the southbound US&nbsp;15 ramps in the southwest quadrant of the junction.<ref name="NBI MD 77 Ramp"/>  A third interchange was added on the south side of Thurmont as a connector between US&nbsp;15 and MD&nbsp;806 in 1985 as well.<ref name="NBI MD 15C"/>  US&nbsp;15's expansion to a four-lane divided highway north of Frederick was completed in 1989 when the piece of highway at the Pennsylvania state line was expanded to four lanes contemporaneous with the four-laning of the Gettysburg bypass.<ref name="1989 map"/>

===Recent and future projects===
US&nbsp;15 in Frederick is a subject of the I-270/US&nbsp;15 Multi-Modal Corridor Study, which encompasses the corridor of the two highways from I-270's interchange with Shady Grove Road in [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] to north of US&nbsp;15's intersection with Biggs Ford Road north of Frederick.  The study was started by the [[Maryland State Highway Administration]] (MDSHA) and [[Maryland Transportation Authority]] in the mid-1990s to examine upgrades to the highway and transit infrastructure within the corridor.<ref name="MDSHA Corridor Study"/>  As part of another long-term project initiated by the I-70 Corridor Planning Study, Jefferson National Pike's interchange with I-70, which was constructed with two ramps in 1969, received two ramps from eastbound I-70 in 1997; that same year, access from northbound US&nbsp;15 and US&nbsp;340 to westbound I-70 was added at the Frederick Freeway interchange.<ref name="1969 map"/><ref name="I-70 Corridor Study"/><ref name="1997 map"/>  Exit numbers on US&nbsp;15's portions of Jefferson National Pike and the Frederick Freeway were changed to their present numbers in 2002.<ref name="Frederick HLR 2002"/>  The interchange between Jefferson National Pike and the Frederick Freeway was transformed from a cloverleaf to a partial cloverleaf interchange in 2004.<ref name="Frederick HLR 2004"/>  Access between US&nbsp;15 and the northern end of MD&nbsp;355, then named Wormans Mill Road, was removed in 2006, the same year a ramp was added from westbound MD&nbsp;26 to northbound US&nbsp;15.<ref name="Frederick HLR 2006"/>  The roundabout at the US&nbsp;15&ndash;MD&nbsp;464 intersection in Point of Rocks was built in 2009.<ref name="Frederick HLR"/>

There are two upcoming construction projects involving US&nbsp;15 in Frederick.  MDSHA plans to replace Motter Avenue's bridge over US&nbsp;15 because the concrete deck of the present bridge is deteriorating and the four-lane width of the bridge is insufficient for the traffic it carries.  The new bridge will have four through traffic lanes and a continuous left turn lane.  The replacement bridge will also be long enough to accommodate future widening of US&nbsp;15.  Engineering and right-of-way acquisition are underway; construction is expected to begin in spring 2012 and last three years.  The new bridge will be built in two sections: one half of the bridge will be constructed immediately to the north of the present bridge, traffic will be moved to the half-bridge and the old bridge removed, and the other half of the new bridge will be constructed in place of the removed bridge.<ref name="MDSHA Motter Avenue"/>

In 2011, MDSHA completed a study to examine constructing an interchange at Monocacy Boulevard on the north side of Frederick to replace the present directional crossover intersection.  Design work is underway on a diamond interchange with the municipal highway, which serves as a circumferential arterial in the northeastern part of the city.  Monocacy Boulevard will be extended west to north&ndash;south Thomas Johnson Drive and meet the eastern end of Christophers Crossing, which is a circumferential boulevard throughout northwestern Frederick.  As part of this project, US&nbsp;15's intersection with Hayward Road will be removed, resulting in the northern end of US&nbsp;15's freeway section being extended from MD&nbsp;26 to Tuscarora Creek.<ref name="MDSHA Monocacy Boulevard"/>
