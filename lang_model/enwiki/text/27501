'''Craigston''' is a heritage-listed [[apartment block]] at 217 Wickham Terrace, [[Spring Hill, Queensland|Spring Hill]], [[City of Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], Australia. It was designed by [[Atkinson & Conrad]] and built in 1927.  It was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 21 October 1992.<ref name=qhr>{{cite QHR|14940|Craigston|600165|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref>

== History ==
This eight-storeyed building was constructed in 1927 for a group of [[Brisbane]] medical practitioners.<ref name=qhr/>

In the mid-1920s Dr Sydney Fancourt McDonald introduced to Brisbane the concept of a multi-function office/residential block, comprising professional suites on the ground floor and residential apartments on the levels above.  Craigston Ltd was formed with McDonald as chairman, and Brisbane architects Atkinson & Conrad (1918-1927) were commissioned to design the structure.<ref name=qhr/>

[[Arnold Conrad]] and David Wales (draftsman) worked on the design in 1926, incorporating possibly the first reinforced concrete frame in a multi-storeyed building in Brisbane.  The design also demonstrated Atkinson & Conrad's interest in the Spanish Mission style, which they used in a variety of local buildings, including the Tristram Factory at [[West End, Queensland|West End]].<ref name=qhr/>

The building was erected in 1927 by builder and engineer [[Walter Taylor (contractor)|Walter Taylor]], under the supervision of architect [[Thomas Brennan Femister Gargett]].  Taylor's later work included the [[Walter Taylor Bridge]](1932-36).<ref name=qhr/>

Craigston was built during the interwar redevelopment of the medical precinct along Wickham Terrace, which included Ballow Chambers, [[Inchcolm]], Brisbane Clinic ([[Lister House]]) and Wickham House.  Their construction constituted the second phase (the first being in the 1880s) of the Terrace's growth as a medical precinct.<ref name=qhr/>

== Description ==
Craigston is located on Wickham Terrace, overlooking the city centre, within a precinct associated since the 1880s with Brisbane's medical profession.<ref name=qhr/>

It is an eight-storeyed building with a sub-floor, rooftop garden, and viewing tower, and is constructed of rendered brick with a steel- reinforced concrete frame.<ref name=qhr/>

The design is [[Spanish Mission style]], with an arched entry, arched windows and a decorative parapet at penthouse level, and a corner tower with a terracotta tiled roof.<ref name=qhr/>

Apart from a sympathetic enclosing of the balconies, the exterior of the building is intact.<ref name=qhr/>

Professional suites occupy the ground and sub-floors, with the remaining levels providing residential accommodation.  Apart from the sixth level, which has always accommodated two apartments, each of the residential levels originally contained one spacious flat with central arrival hall, servants' rooms in the back western corner and family living in the L-shape.  Most of the flats have been subdivided since, with apartments currently numbering twelve.<ref name=qhr/>

The block is serviced by a central elevator, dumb waiter and common L-shaped hallways, which are lined with dark-stained silky oak dado panelling. Access to the professional suites is via the front entrance, with a separate side entry (at the southwest end of the hallway) reserved for the use of residents.<ref name=qhr/>

Several small garden beds with edgings of [[Brisbane tuff]] have been established at the front and along the south-western side of the building.<ref name=qhr/>
