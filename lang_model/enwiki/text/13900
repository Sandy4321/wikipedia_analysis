==History==

Knutsford was a [[chapel of ease]] in the [[parish]] of [[St Mary's Church, Rostherne]] until the 18th century.  In 1741 an [[Act of Parliament]] was obtained for it to become a distinct parish.<ref name="richards">{{citation  | last =Richards | first =Raymond | title =Old Cheshire Churches | publisher =Batsford | date =1947 | location =London | pages =195&ndash;197}}</ref>  The church was built between 1741 and 1744 at a cost of <U+00A3>4,000, the architect being J. Garlive.  In 1879 an [[apse|apsidal]] [[chancel]] was replaced by a flat one by [[Alfred Darbyshire]].<ref name=pev>{{citation  | last =Pevsner | first =Nikolaus | authorlink =Nikolaus Pevsner | coauthors =[[Edward Hubbard]] | title =The Buildings of England: Cheshire |edition= | publisher =[[Yale University Press]]| date =2003| origyear=1971| location =New Haven| pages =250&ndash;251 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =0 300 09588 0 }}</ref>

==Architecture==
===Structure===

The church is built in [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style in brick with stone dressings and a slate roof. The plan of the church consists of a west tower, a two-storeyed nave and a shallow chancel.  The tower is in four stages with a west doorway over which is a round-arched window, a clock and round-arched belfry windows.  The top of the tower has a [[parapet]] with modillion brackets swept between urns.  The parapet of the nave has alternating solid and [[balustrade]]d panels.  At the southwest is a doorway in a [[pediment]]ed case with a [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] [[architrave]] and a round-arched inner door. There is a similar doorway at the northwest.  The nave has a classical arcade of four bays with [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] columns on high bases carrying semicircular arches.<ref name="images"/>

===Fittings and furnishings===

Galleries are on the north, west and south sides.<ref name="images"/>  The [[baptismal font|font]] is made of [[marble]] and has an oak cover.
