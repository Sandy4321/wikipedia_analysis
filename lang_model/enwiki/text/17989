{{Infobox astatine}}
'''Astatine''' is a rare [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[chemical element]] with the [[chemical symbol]] '''At''' and atomic number 85. It occurs on Earth as the result of the radioactive decay of certain heavier elements. All of its [[isotope]]s are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a [[half-life]] of 8.1 hours. Accordingly, much less is known about astatine than most other elements. The observed properties are consistent with it behaving as a heavier analog of [[iodine]]; many other properties have been estimated based on this resemblance.

Elemental astatine has never been viewed, because a mass large enough to be seen by the naked eye would be immediately vaporized by its radioactive heating. It is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a [[semiconductor]] or possibly a metal; it will probably have a higher melting point than iodine. Chemically, astatine can behave like the other [[halogen]]s (the group of elements including [[fluorine]] and [[chlorine]]), specifically as a heavier analog of iodine, as it is expected to form ionic astatides with alkali or alkaline earth metals and is known to form covalent compounds with nonmetals, [[interhalogen|including other halogens]]. However, it can also behave as a metal, with a cationic chemistry that distinguishes it from the lighter halogens. The second longest-lived isotope of astatine, astatine-211, is the only one with any commercial application, being used in medicine to diagnose and treat some diseases via its emission of [[alpha particle]]s. Only extremely small quantities are used due to its intense radioactivity.

[[Dale R. Corson]], [[Kenneth Ross MacKenzie]], and [[Emilio Segr<U+00E8>]] produced the element at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1940,  naming it "astatine", after the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''astatos'' (<U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C2>) "unstable". Three years later it was found in nature, although it is the least abundant of the non-[[transuranic element]]s in the Earth's crust, with much less than one gram being present at any given time. Six [[Isotopes of astatine|astatine isotopes]], with [[mass number]]s of 214 to 219, are found in nature as the [[decay product]]s of various heavier elements, but neither the most stable isotope astatine-210 nor the medically useful astatine-211 occurs naturally.

==Characteristics==
Astatine is an extremely radioactive element; all its isotopes have [[half-life|half-lives]] of less than 12 hours, decaying into [[bismuth]], [[polonium]], [[radon]], or other astatine isotopes. Of the first 101 elements in the periodic table, only [[francium]] is less stable.<ref name="Audi2003">{{cite journal |first1=G.|last1=Audi|first2=A.

In 1936, a team of Romanian physicist [[Horia Hulubei]] and French physicist [[Yvette Cauchois]] claimed to have discovered element 85 via X-ray analysis. In 1939 they published another paper which supported and extended previous data. In 1944, Hulubei published a summary of data he had obtained up to that time, claiming it was supported by the work of other researchers. He chose the name "dor", presumably from the Romanian for "longing" [for peace], as the world had been at war for almost five years by then. As Hulubei was writing in French, a language which does not accommodate the "ine" suffix, dor would likely have been rendered in English as "dorine", had it been adopted. In 1947, Hulubei's claim was effectively rejected by the Austrian chemist [[Friedrich Paneth]], who would later chair the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] committee responsible for recognition of new elements. Even though Hulubei's samples did contain astatine, his means to detect it were too weak, by current standards, to enable correct identification.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Finding Eka-Iodine: Discovery Priority in Modern Times|first1=S.

There are 39 known isotopes of astatine, with atomic masses (mass numbers) of 191<U+2013>229. Theoretical modelling suggests a further 37 astatine isotopes could exist.<ref name="Fry">{{cite journal |first1=C.|last1=Fry|first2=M.|last2=Thoennessen|year=2013 |title=Discovery of the astatine, radon, francium, and radium isotopes |journal=Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables  |volume=09 |pages=497<U+2013>519 |doi=10.1016/j.adt.2012.05.003}}</ref> No stable or long-lived astatine isotope has been observed nor is one expected to exist.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|p=229}}

Astatine's [[alpha decay]] energies follow the same trend as for other heavy elements.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|p=229}} Lighter astatine isotopes have quite [[Alpha particle#Energy and absorption|high energies]] of alpha decay, which become lower as the nuclei become heavier. Astatine-211 has a significantly higher energy than the previous isotope, because it has a nucleus with 126 neutrons, and 126 is a [[magic number (physics)|magic number]] corresponding to a filled neutron shell. Despite having a similar half-life to the previous isotope (8.1&nbsp;hours for astatine-210 and 7.2&nbsp;hours for astatine-211), the alpha decay probability is much higher for the latter: 41.81% against only 0.18%.<ref name="Audi2003" />{{efn|This means that, if decay modes other than alpha are omitted, then astatine-210 has an alpha decay half-life of 4,628.6&nbsp;hours (128.9&nbsp;days) and astatine-211 has one of only 17.2 hours (0.7&nbsp;days). Therefore, astatine-211 is very much less stable toward alpha decay than the previous isotope.}} The two following isotopes release even more energy, with astatine-213 releasing the most energy. For this reason, it is the shortest-lived astatine isotope.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|p=229}} Even though heavier astatine isotopes release less energy, no long-lived astatine isotope exists, due to the increasing role of [[beta decay]] (electron emission).{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|p=229}} This decay mode is especially important for astatine; as early as 1950 it was postulated that all isotopes of the element undergo beta decay.<ref>{{cite book|title=Isotope Geology|edition=2nd|publisher=Pergamon Press|page=403|year=1956 | isbn = 978-0-470-70800-2 |first=K.|last=Rankama}}</ref> Beta decay modes have been found for all astatine isotopes except astatine-213, -214, -215, and -216m.<ref name="Audi2003" /> Astatine-210 and lighter isotopes exhibit beta plus decay ([[positron emission]]), astatine-216 and heavier isotopes exhibit beta (minus) decay, and astatine-212 decays via both modes, while astatine-211 undergoes [[electron capture]].<ref name="Audi2003" />

The most stable isotope is astatine-210, which has a half-life of 8.1&nbsp;hours. The primary decay mode is beta plus, to the relatively long-lived (in comparison to astatine isotopes) alpha emitter [[polonium-210]]. In total, only five isotopes have half-lives exceeding one hour (astatine-207 to -211). The least stable ground state isotope is astatine-213, with a half-life of 125 nanoseconds. It undergoes alpha decay to the extremely long-lived bismuth-209.<ref name="Audi2003" />

Astatine has 24 known [[nuclear isomer]]s, which are nuclei with one or more [[nucleon]]s ([[proton]]s or [[neutron]]s) in an [[excited state]]. A nuclear isomer may also be called a "[[metastability|meta]]-state", meaning the system has more [[internal energy]] than the "[[ground state]]" (the state with the lowest possible internal energy), making the former likely to decay into the latter.

Six astatine isotopes occur naturally (astatine-214 to <U+2212>219).{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|p=228<U+2013>229}} Because of their short [[half-lives]], they are found only in [[trace radioisotope|trace]] amounts.<ref name="chain">{{cite book|title=Chemistry and Analysis of Radionuclides: Laboratory Techniques and Methodology|publisher=Wiley-VCH|pages=2<U+2013>3|year=2011 | isbn = 978-3-527-32658-7 |first1=J.|last1=Lehto|first2=X.|last2=Hou}}</ref> Data on the occurrence of astatine in stars is sparse.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|p=228}}

Four of these isotopes (astatine-215, <U+2212>217, <U+2212>218, and <U+2212>219) are found due to their production in major natural [[decay chains]]. Francium-223, the parent isotope of astatine-219, alpha decays with a probability of only 0.006%, making this astatine isotope extremely rare compared to other astatine isotopes; this is despite its half-life of 56 seconds being the longest of the natural astatine isotopes.<ref name="Audi2003" /> Astatine-219 decays to polonium-215, which beta decays, with a smaller probability of 0.00023%, to astatine-215.

Astatine was first produced by bombarding bismuth-209 with energetic alpha particles, and this is still the major route used to create the relatively long-lived isotopes astatine-209 through astatine-211. Astatine is only produced in minuscule quantities, with modern techniques allowing production runs of up to 6.6&nbsp;[[giga-|giga]][[becquerel]]s{{sfn|Zalutsky|Pruszynski|2011}} (about 86&nbsp;[[nanogram]]s or 2.47 <U+00D7> 10<sup>14</sup> atoms).

===Separation methods===
Since the element is the main product of the synthesis, after its formation it must only be separated from the target and any significant contaminants. Several methods are available, "but they generally follow one of two approaches<U+2014>dry distillation or [wet] acid treatment of the target followed by solvent extraction." The methods summarized below are modern adaptations of older procedures, as reviewed by Kugler and Keller.{{sfn|Kugler|Keller|1985|pp=95<U+2013>106, 133<U+2013>139}}{{efn|See also Lavrukhina and Pozdnyakov.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|pp=243<U+2013>253}}}} Pre-1985 techniques more often address the elimination of co-produced toxic polonium; this requirement is now mitigated by capping the energy of the cyclotron irradiation beam.{{sfn|Zalutsky|Pruszynski|2011}}
 
====Dry====
The astatine-containing cyclotron target is heated to a temperature of around 650&nbsp;<U+00B0>C. The astatine [[Volatilization|volatilizes]] and is condensed in (typically) a [[cold trap]]. Higher temperatures of up to around 850&nbsp;<U+00B0>C may increase the yield, at the risk of bismuth contamination from concurrent volatilization. Redistilling the condensate may be required to minimize the presence of bismuth{{sfn|Kugler|Keller|1985|p=97}} (as bismuth can interfere with astatine [[radioactive tracer|labeling reactions]]). The astatine is recovered from the trap using one or more low concentration solvents such as [[sodium hydroxide]], [[methanol]] or [[chloroform]]. Astatine yields of up to around 80% may be achieved. Dry separation is the method most commonly used to produce a chemically useful form of astatine.<ref name="Larsen">{{cite journal |first1=R. H.|last1=Larsen|first2=B. W.|last2=Wieland|first3=M. R.

====Wet====
The bismuth (or sometimes [[bismuth trioxide]]) target is dissolved in, for example, concentrated nitric or perchloric acid.

A separation yield of 93% using nitric acid has been reported, falling to 72% by the time purification procedures were completed (distillation of nitric acid, purging residual [[nitrogen oxide]]s, and redissolving [[bismuth nitrate]] to enable [[liquid-liquid extraction]]).<ref>{{cite journal |first1=A.

Newly formed astatine-211 is the subject of ongoing research in [[nuclear medicine]].<ref name="211Att" /> It must be used quickly as it decays with a half-life of 7.2&nbsp;hours; this is long enough to permit [[radioactive tracer|multistep labeling strategies]]. Astatine-211 has potential for targeted alpha particle [[radiotherapy]], since it decays either via emission of an alpha particle (to bismuth-207), or via electron capture (to an extremely short-lived nuclide, polonium-211, which undergoes further alpha decay).<ref name="211Att" />

The principal medicinal difference between astatine-211 and [[iodine-131]] (a radioactive iodine isotope also used in medicine) is that iodine-131 emits high energy beta particles, and astatine does not. Beta particles have much greater penetrating power through tissues than do the much heavier alpha particles. An average alpha particle released by astatine-211 can travel up to 70&nbsp;<U+00B5>m through surrounding tissues; an average energy beta particle emitted by iodine-131 can travel nearly 30 times as far, to about 2&nbsp;mm.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|p=233}} The short half-life and limited penetrating power of alpha radiation through tissues offers advantages in situations where the "tumor burden is low and/or malignant cell populations are located in close proximity to essential normal tissues."{{sfn|Zalutsky|Pruszynski|2011}}

Several obstacles have been encountered in the development of astatine-based [[radiopharmaceuticals]] for [[cancer]] treatment. [[World War II]] delayed research for close to a decade. Results of early experiments indicated that a cancer-selective carrier would need to be developed and it was not until the 1970s that [[Monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]] became available for this purpose. Unlike iodine, astatine shows a tendency to [[dehalogenation|dehalogenate]] from molecular carriers such as these, particularly at [[Orbital_hybridisation#sp3|sp<sup>3</sup> carbon sites]]{{efn|In other words, where carbon's one s [[atomic orbital]] and three p orbitals [[Orbital_hybridisation|hybridize]] to give four new orbitals shaped as intermediates between the original s and p orbitals.}} (less so from [[Orbital_hybridisation#sp2|sp<sup>2</sup> sites]]). Given the toxicity of astatine accumulated and retained in the body, this emphasized the need to ensure it remained attached to its host molecule. While astatine carriers that are slowly metabolized can be assessed for their efficacy, more rapidly metabolized carriers remain a significant obstacle to the evaluation of astatine in nuclear medicine. Mitigating the effects of astatine induced radiolysis of labeling chemistry and carrier molecules is another area requiring further development. A practical application for astatine as a cancer treatment would potentially be suitable for a "staggering" number of patients; production of astatine in the quantities that would be required remains an issue.<ref name="Wilbur"/><ref>{{cite journal |first1=G. |last1=Vaidyanathan |first2=M.

Animal studies show that astatine, similarly to iodine, although to a lesser extent, is preferentially concentrated in the [[thyroid gland]]. Unlike iodine, astatine also shows a tendency to be taken up by the lungs and spleen, possibly due to in body oxidation of At<sup><U+2013></sup> to At<sup>+</sup>.<ref name=Guerard/> If administered in the form of a radiocolloid it tends to concentrate in the [[liver]]. Experiments in rats and monkeys suggest that astatine-211 causes much greater damage to the thyroid gland than does iodine-131, with repetitive injection of the nuclide resulting in necrosis and cell [[dysplasia]] within the gland.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|pp=232<U+2013>233}} Early research suggested that injection of astatine into female rodents caused morphological changes in breast tissue;<ref>{{cite book |last1= Odell |first1= T.
