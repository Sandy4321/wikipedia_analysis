'''Jamie Moyer''' (born November 17, 1962 in [[Sellersville, Pennsylvania]]) is an [[United States|American]] professional left handed [[baseball]] [[pitcher]] who is currently a [[free agent]]. At the time of his last game to date (in June, 2010), he was the oldest player in the major leagues and had the most wins, losses, and strikeouts of any active Major League pitcher. He has been likened to [[Phil Niekro]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/sports/baseball/13moyer.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1|title=For Moyer, a Slow Build and a Quick Hook |last=Kepner|first=Tyler|date=2008-10-12|work=New York Times|accessdate=2009-06-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/team/player_career.jsp?player_id=119469|title=Biography and Career Highlights (2008)|work=Phillies.MLB.com|publisher=Major League Baseball|accessdate=2009-06-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/sports/index.ssf/2008/09/philadelphia_phillies_pitcher.html|title=Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Jamie Moyer a marvel at 45|last=Brown|first=Garry|date=2008-09-29|work=The Republican|accessdate=2009-06-01}}</ref>

Moyer has pitched for the [[Chicago Cubs]], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], [[St. Louis Cardinals]], [[Baltimore Orioles]], [[Boston Red Sox]], [[Seattle Mariners]] and [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. He made the [[2003 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star team]] in {{mlby|2003}}, while with the Mariners. Moyer has won numerous awards for [[philanthropy]] and [[community service]], including the 2003 [[Roberto Clemente Award]], the 2003 [[Lou Gehrig Memorial Award]], the 2003 [[Hutch Award]] and the {{mlby|2004}} [[Branch Rickey Award]]. Moyer is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date to have appeared in Major League games in four decades.

== Amateur career==
===High school===
Moyer attended [[Souderton Area High School]] in [[Souderton, Pennsylvania]], where he played baseball, basketball, and golf.

===College===
Moyer pitched at [[Saint Joseph's University]] where in 1984 he set the school's single-season records in [[Wins (baseball statistics)|wins]], with 16, [[Earned run average|ERA]], with 1.99, and [[strikeout]]s, with 90.<ref name="spn">{{cite web |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=474433 |title=Phillies' Moyer excited for first World Series |accessdate=2008-10-20 |author=Associated Press |authorlink=Associated Press |date=2008-10-19 |work=SportingNews.com}}</ref> In 1997 he became the only Saint Joseph's [[baseball]] player to have his jersey number, number 10, retired,<ref name="spn"/> and was one of three inductees into the first class of the St. Joseph's Baseball Hall of Fame. 

He was drafted by the [[Chicago Cubs]] in the sixth round of the 1984 amateur draft, and completed his college degree from [[Indiana University]] in 1996.

==Professional career==
===1986<U+2013>1996===
Moyer was selected a [[New York <U+2013> Penn League]] [[All-Star]] in 1984. He made his major league debut with the Chicago Cubs on June 16, 1986, against [[Steve Carlton]] and the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], and got his first win. Later that year, on August 16, he threw his first [[shutout]] against the [[Montreal Expos]]. He was also the starting pitcher for the Cubs on the day that [[Greg Maddux]] made his major league debut.

In 1987, Moyer ranked tenth in the [[National League]] in strikeouts with 147, while winning 12 games. Following his then-best season in 1988, he was traded to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] as part of the 9-player [[Rafael Palmeiro]] for [[Mitch Williams (baseball)|Mitch Williams]] trade.[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEED7163CF935A35751C1A96E948260]

Moyer was on the [[disabled list]] with a sore left shoulder for much of a disappointing 1989 season.  1990 saw Moyer spend time in the [[bullpen]] before regaining a spot in the starting rotation.

Moyer was released as a [[free agent]] after the 1990 season and was signed by the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. He made seven starts for the Cardinals in 1991 before being sent to the [[Minor league baseball|minor leagues]] on May 24, and was released on October 14.

In {{By|1992}}, Moyer went to [[spring training]] with the [[Chicago Cubs]], but was released and spent the rest of the season in the minor league system of the [[Detroit Tigers]]. On December 18, 1992, Moyer signed with the [[Baltimore Orioles]].

Moyer began the {{By|1993}} campaign in the Oriole minor leagues, before being called up on May 30. He tied his career-high total in wins with 12 and a new career-low [[earned run average|ERA]] of 3.43. The strike-shortened 1994 season was disappointing for him, but he was third on the staff in [[innings pitched]]. In 1995, Moyer again found himself in the Baltimore bullpen, but worked his way back into the starting rotation. He was released following the 1995 campaign, but his contract was picked up by the [[Boston Red Sox]] on December 22. Moyer started the {{By|1996}} season in the Boston bullpen, but made seven starts for the Red Sox by year's end.

===Seattle Mariners===
====1996<U+2013>1998====
[[Image:J Moyer.JPG|250px|thumb|Moyer was the Mariner franchise's all-time leader in starts, wins and IP. He went 145-87 with an ERA of 3.97 over eleven seasons with the M's.]]
In the middle of the 1996 season, he was traded to the [[Seattle Mariners]] on July 30, where he would start 11 games and go 6<U+2013>2. His record of 13<U+2013>3 would lead the majors in winning percentage at .813.

In {{By|1997}}, Moyer was fifth in the [[American League]] with 17 wins. His 17<U+2013>5 record gave him the second highest winning percentage (.773) in the league. Moyer would make his first [[postseason]] start against his former club Baltimore, but was forced out with a strained elbow in the fifth inning.

In {{By|1998}}, Moyer went 15<U+2013>9 with a 3.53 [[earned run average|ERA]]. He was third in innings pitched with 234.1. He registered his 100th career win against the [[Cleveland Indians]] on August 27, as well as his 1000th career strikeout with a sixth inning strikeout of [[David Bell (baseball)|David Bell]]. He was named Seattle's Pitcher of the Year by the Seattle chapter of the [[Baseball Writers Association of America|BBWAA]].

====1999<U+2013>2000====
He walked two or fewer batters in 29 of his 32 starts. He ranked fourth in the [[American League]] averaging just 1.9 walks per nine innings. Moyer was also third among the league in innings pitched and seventh winning percentage. He matched career-best seven game winning streak that stretched from May 11 to July 7. He started the Inaugural Game at [[Safeco Field]] on July 15 against the [[San Diego Padres]], throwing a called strike to San Diego's [[Quilvio Veras]] for the first pitch getting a no-decision in Seattle's 3<U+2013>2 loss after leaving with a 2<U+2013>1 lead after eight innings.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jul/16/sports/sp-56603 the first game]</ref> He defeated Baltimore for the ninth straight time on July 31; did not lose to the Orioles, in the 1990s. Moyer's only loss at Safeco came on August 5 against the  [[New York Yankees]]. He recorded three complete games in the final month of the season, tossing back-to-back complete games on September 14 and 19. His 2.30 ERA after the All-Star break was the second-lowest among AL starters, behind only [[Pedro Martinez]] with his 2.01 ERA. He pitched 4 complete games for the second-straight season, tying his career best.

In {{By|1999}}, Moyer went 14<U+2013>8 with a 3.87 [[earned run average|ERA]] and was voted to ''[[The Sporting News]]'' [[American League|AL]] All-Star team. He again won the Seattle Pitcher of the Year award.

{{By|2000}} saw Moyer rebound from an early shoulder injury to tally 13 wins, giving him at least 13 in each of his past five seasons. He made his first [[Opening Day]] start for Seattle, but lost to the [[Boston Red Sox]] 2<U+2013>0 on April 4. His shoulder problems led his [[earned run average|ERA]] to balloon to 5.49. A knee injury<ref>http://www.seattlepi.com/baseball/moyr09.shtml</ref> suffered on the last pitch of a simulated game caused him to miss Seattle's trip to the [[American League Championship Series]] against the eventual [[World Series]] champion [[New York Yankees]].

Moyer lost five consecutive starts from August 4-24. He allowed a career-high and a club-record 11 earned runs in a 19<U+2013>3 loss on August 9 against the [[Chicago White Sox]]. He allowed 11 runs, 6 earned, in a 14<U+2013>4 loss on August 14 against the [[Detroit Tigers]], joining the [[Houston Astros]]' [[Jose Lima]] as the first two pitchers since {{By|1950}} to allow ten or more runs in consecutive starts. Moyer allowed a career-high seven walks in a no-decision on August 29 against the Yankees. The Mariners' 7<U+2013>2 win on September 9 against the [[Minnesota Twins]] snapped a six-game losing streak. Moyer lasted just one-and-two-thirds innings in his final start, getting a no-decision September 28 against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. Moyer suffered a hairline fracture of left [[kneecap]] while pitching a simulated game on October 7.

====2001<U+2013>2003====
In {{By|2001}} Moyer won 20 games, ranked tied for second in the [[American League]], and his 3.43 [[earned run average|ERA]] was sixth in the [[American League|AL]]. He earned his 150th career win against the Texas Rangers on September 24. He became only the second Mariner in history to win 20 games on October 5, former teammate [[Randy Johnson]] being the other. Moyer went 3<U+2013>0 with a 1.89 [[earned run average|ERA]] in the [[postseason]]. He won Games 2 and 5 for the Mariners against the [[Cleveland Indians]] and also carried Game 3 against the [[New York Yankees]] before Seattle lost in Game 5.

In {{By|2002}}, Moyer went 13<U+2013>8 with a then career low 3.32 [[earned run average|ERA]]. Although he pitched 20 more innings and had a lower [[earned run average|ERA]] than in 2001, he won seven fewer games. 

Moyer was fourth in the AL in innings with 230.2. He was tied for second in the league with 34 starts, fifth in opponents' batting average, holding opposing hitters to a .230 clip, and ninth in ERA with 3.32. He tossed a team-high 24 consecutive scoreless innings from June 16 to July 6. He averaged just two walks per nine innings pitched, tied for sixth-best in the AL. The Mariners were 20<U+2013>14 in his starts. His four complete games tied his career high, also done in {{By|1998}} and {{By|1999}}. He threw his seventh career complete game shutout, first of the season, on June 10 against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in a 10<U+2013>0 win. Moyer's start on June 16 against San Diego began a streak of 24 consecutive shutout innings over four starts. He finished June 3<U+2013>1 with a Major League best 1.01 ERA in five starts. He collected his 1,500th career strikeout August 24 against the [[Cleveland Indians]].

In {{By|2003}}, Moyer won a career high 21 games, lost 7, and had a career low 3.27 ERA. He tied for second in the American League for wins and was sixth in ERA. His .750 winning percentage placed him fourth in the league and his 21 wins are a club record. He became the only Seattle pitcher to win 20 games more than once. Moyer was voted to his first [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] in 2003. He was named for the third time the Seattle Pitcher of the Year. Moyer was also the winner of the [[Roberto Clemente Award]], given annually to the big leaguer whose success on the field is mirrored by his impact in community service, The [[Hutch Award]], presented annually by the world-renowned Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center to an MLB player displaying "honor, courage and dedication to baseball, both on and off the field," and The [[Lou Gehrig Award]], presented annually to the MLB player who both on and off the field best exemplifies the character of [[Lou Gehrig]].

While the year started well for him, going 5<U+2013>0 with a 1.59 [[earned run average|ERA]] from May 20 <U+2013> June 18, Moyer ended {{By|2004}} on a 10-game losing streak.

Despite leading the rotation with ten wins, Moyer sported a 5.47 ERA when the Phillies decided to move him to the bullpen, making room in their rotation for [[Pedro Mart<U+00ED>nez]].<ref name="pedro">{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090810&content_id=6353302&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|title=Pedro to make '09 debut Wednesday|last=Miller|first=Doug|date=2009-08-11|publisher=Major League Baseball|accessdate=2009-08-10}}</ref> Regarding the move, manager [[Charlie Manuel]] said,
<blockquote>
"Jamie was a total professional and team player when we let him know of the decision to move him to the bullpen. He has been, and will continue to be, a very important part of this team."<ref name="pedro"/>
</blockquote>

In Moyer's bullpen debut on August 18, he relieved Mart<U+00ED>nez in the fourth inning after a rain delay, pitching six scoreless innings to earn his 11th win of the season.  A similar situation occurred on August 28, as Moyer again relieved Martinez in the third inning after a rain delay.  He pitched four and one third innings in relief, giving up one earned run and picked up his 12th win of the season.

Moyer tore three muscles in his groin and lower abdomen while pitching against the [[Houston Astros]] on September 29.

====2010====
When asked about retiring after the expiration of his Phillies contract at the end of 2010, Moyer said, "You know, I'm going to leave that as an open-ended question because I don't know how to answer that.  It could be (my last season). It potentially could be. But so could have last year.
