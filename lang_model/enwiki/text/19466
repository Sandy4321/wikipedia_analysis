'''Interstate 55''' (abbreviated '''I-55''') is an [[interstate highway]] in the central [[United States]]. Like other interstates, it is commonly referred to as I-55. Its odd number indicates that it is primarily a north-south highway. It goes from [[Laplace, Louisiana]] (some 25 miles (40 km) west of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]) at [[Interstate 10]] to [[Chicago]] at [[U.S. Route 41]] ([[Lake Shore Drive]]), at [[McCormick Place]].

The section of Interstate 55 between Chicago and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] was built as a bypass for [[U.S. Highway 66]].

Interstate 55 is the only Interstate highway that crosses the [[Mississippi River]] twice &mdash; once at [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and then again at [[St. Louis, Missouri]].

=== Louisiana ===
{{main|Interstate 55 in Louisiana}}
In [[Louisiana]], Interstate 55 runs nearly 66 miles from south to north, from [[Interstate 10]] near [[Laplace, Louisiana|Laplace]] - roughly 20 miles west of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] - to the [[Mississippi]] state line near [[Kentwood, Louisiana|Kentwood]].
=== Mississippi ===
{{main|Interstate 55 in Mississippi}}
In [[Mississippi]], I-55 runs 290.5 miles from the [[Louisiana]] border near [[Osyka, Mississippi|Osyka]] to [[Southaven, Mississippi|Southaven]] on the [[Tennessee]] border, just south of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. The highway parallels [[U.S. Route 51|U.S. 51]] during its trek roughly through the center of Magnolia State.

The Mississippi section of Interstate 55 is defined in Mississippi Code <U+00A7> 65-3-3.

I-255 was the former numbering of [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]] between I-55 and I-40 through Midtown [[Memphis, Tennessee]].
[[Image:Toisign1.gif|thumb|right|108px|I-44/55/64/70 on one highway sign in downtown St. Louis]]

I-55 is often called the ''Mississippi Delta Highway'' because of its proximity to the Mississippi River.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

=== Tennessee ===
{{main|Interstate 55 in Tennessee}}
I-55 lies entirely within the city of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], passing through the southern and western parts of the city and providing a bypass of downtown for motorists who do not want to take Interstates [[Interstate 240|240]] and [[Interstate 40|40]] through downtown to cross the [[Mississippi River]].
=== Arkansas ===
{{main|Interstate 55 in Arkansas}}
I-55 enters Arkansas from Tennessee as it crosses the Mississippi river.  It overlaps I-40 for approximately 2.8 miles (4.5 km) in West Memphis.  After separating from I-40, I-55 turns northward and runs to the Missouri border, via the intersection with the stretch of [[U.S. Route 63|U.S. 63]] that holds the future alignment of [[Interstate 555]].
=== Missouri ===
{{main|Interstate 55 in Missouri}}
In Missouri, I-55 runs from the southeastern part of the state, at the Arkansas border, to St. Louis.  It joins [[Interstate 64]] and [[Interstate 70]] on the Poplar Street Bridge, which crosses the Mississippi River into Illinois.

A section of the I-55 in southern [[St. Louis County, Missouri]] has been named the "Rosa Parks Freeway" although the general public still refers to it as I-55.

On July 26th 2007 a small section of I-55 at the St. Louis city/county line was named "Thomas G. Smith Jr. Memorial Freeway".

=== Illinois ===
{{main|Interstate 55 in Illinois|Stevenson Expressway}}
[[Image:Interstate55NorthTerminus.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Northern terminus at [[Lake Shore Drive]]/[[U.S. Route 41]].]]
Crossing over into Illinois, I-55, near the [[I-270]]/[[I-70]] split, is referred to as the Paul Simon Freeway. This is in reference to the local politician [[Paul Martin Simon]].  Further north, between the St. Louis area and Springfield, IL, I-55 is named The Vince Demuzio Expressway in reference to Illinois state politician [[Vince Demuzio]].  I-55 parallels the historical [[Route 66]] from [[East St. Louis, Illinois|East St. Louis]] to Chicago, passing near [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] and [[Bloomington, Illinois|Bloomington]]/[[Normal, Illinois|Normal]].

When the freeway was being planned during the 1960s, Illinois Governor [[Otto Kerner, Jr.|Otto Kerner]] made an effort to have the road redirected near the larger city of Peoria instead of the more straightforward route through the Bloomington-Normal area. This ultimately failed plan was ridiculed in the press as the "Kerner Curve".{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  The function of an Interstate highway connection between Springfield and Peoria was later filled by [[Interstate 155 (Illinois)|Interstate 155]], which connects nearby Lincoln and Morton and forms a triangle between the three population centers in Central Illinois ([[Interstate 74|I-74]], [[Interstate 155 (Illinois)|I-155]] and [[Interstate 55|I-55]] connect Peoria, Springfield and Bloomington-Normal)

In the Chicago area, the expressway is referred to as the [[Adlai E. Stevenson II|Adlai E. Stevenson]] Expressway in honor of one of Illinois' favorite sons. The general public typically refers to this freeway as either "I-55" or "The Stevenson"; the terms are used interchangeably, but "The Stevenson" tends to be more popular in Chicago proper while "I-55" is more commonly used in the suburbs.
