'''Charles Lutwidge Dodgson''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|t<U+0283>|<U+0251>r|l|z|_|<U+02C8>|l|<U+028C>|t|w|<U+026A>|d<U+0292>|_|<U+02C8>|d|<U+0252>|d<U+0292>|s|<U+0259>n}};<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2001 |title=Dodgson, Charles Lutwidge |encyclopedia=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/Dodgson }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2011 |title =Dodgson, Charles Lutwidge |encyclopedia=Random House Dictionary |publisher=Random House, Inc |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/charles+lutwidge+dodgson }}</ref> 27 January 1832 <U+2013> 14 January 1898), better known by his [[pen name]], '''Lewis Carroll''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|k|<U+00E6>r|<U+0259>l}}), was an English writer, [[mathematician]], [[logician]], [[Anglican]] [[deacon]] and photographer. His most famous writings are ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and its sequel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', as well as the poems "[[The Hunting of the Snark]]" and "[[Jabberwocky]]", all examples of the genre of [[literary nonsense]]. He is noted for his facility at [[word play]], logic, and fantasy, and there are societies in many parts of the world (including the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, and New Zealand<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lewiscarrollsociety.org.uk/pages/eventspeopleplaces/societies.html |title=Lewis Carroll Societies |publisher=Lewiscarrollsociety.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-12}}</ref>) dedicated to the enjoyment and promotion of his works and the investigation of his life.

==Antecedents==
Dodgson's family was predominantly northern English, with Irish connections. Conservative and [[High Church]] Anglican, most of Dodgson's ancestors were army officers or [[Church of England]] clergy. His great-grandfather, also named [[Charles Dodgson (bishop)|Charles Dodgson]], had risen through the ranks of the church to become the [[Bishop of Elphin]].<ref>Clark (1979) p.10</ref>  His grandfather, another Charles, had been an army captain, killed in action in Ireland in 1803 when his two sons were hardly more than babies.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Collingwood|first=Stuart|title=The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll|publisher=T. Fisher Unwin|year=1898|location=London|pages=6<U+2013>7}}</ref> His mother's name was Frances Jane Lutwidge.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Collingwood|first=Stuart|title=The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll|publisher=T. Fisher Unwin|year=1898|location=London|page=8}}</ref>

The oldest of these sons <U+2013> yet another [[Charles Dodgson (archdeacon)|Charles Dodgson]] <U+2013> was Carroll's father. He reverted to the other family tradition and took [[holy orders]]. He went to [[Westminster School]], and then to [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. He was mathematically gifted and won a [[double first]] degree, which could have been the prelude to a brilliant academic career. Instead he married his first cousin in 1827 and became a country [[parson]].<ref name="kqihew">{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Morton|title=Lewis Carroll: A Biography |pages=30<U+2013>35 |date=26 November 1996 |publisher=[[Vintage Books]]|isbn=978-0-679-74562-4}}</ref>

Dodgson was born in the little parsonage of [[Daresbury]] in [[Cheshire]] near the towns of [[Warrington]] and [[Runcorn]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://g.co/maps/cp7d5|title=Google map of Daresbury, UK|accessdate=22 October 2011}}</ref> the eldest boy but already the third child of the four-and-a-half-year-old marriage. Eight more children were to follow. When Charles was 11, his father was given the [[Benefice#Church of England|living]] of [[Croft-on-Tees]] in North [[Yorkshire]], and the whole family moved to the spacious rectory. This remained their home for the next twenty-five years.

Young Charles' father was an active and highly conservative cleric of the Church of England who later became the [[Archdeacon of Richmond]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Dodgson.html|title=Charles Lutwidge Dodgson|work=The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive|accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref> and involved himself, sometimes influentially, in the intense religious disputes that were dividing the church. He was High Church, inclining to [[Anglo-Catholicism]], an admirer of [[John Henry Newman]] and the [[Tractarian movement]], and did his best to instill such views in his children. Young Charles was to develop an ambiguous relationship with his father's values and with the Church of England as a whole.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Morton|title=Lewis Carroll: A Biography |pages=200<U+2013>202|date=26 November 1996|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-679-74562-4}}</ref>

==Education==

===Home life===
During his early youth, Dodgson was educated at home. His "reading lists" preserved in the family archives testify to a precocious intellect: at the age of seven the child was reading ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''. He also suffered from a [[Stuttering|stammer]] <U+2013> a condition shared by most of his siblings<ref>Cohen (1995) p.4</ref> <U+2013> that often influenced his social life throughout his years. At the age of twelve he was sent to Richmond Grammar School (now part of [[Richmond School]]) at nearby [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]].

===Rugby===
In 1846, young Dodgson moved on to [[Rugby School]], where he was evidently less happy, for as he wrote some years after leaving the place:
{{quote|I cannot say ... that any earthly considerations would induce me to go through my three years again ... I can honestly say that if I could have been ... secure from annoyance at night, the hardships of the daily life would have been comparative trifles to bear.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Collingwood|first=Stuart|title=The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll|publisher=T. Fisher Unwin|year=1898|location=London|pages=30<U+2013>31}}</ref>}}
Scholastically, though, he excelled with apparent ease. "I have not had a more promising boy at his age since I came to Rugby", observed R. B. Mayor, then Mathematics master.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Collingwood|first=Stuart|title=The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll|publisher=T. Fisher Unwin|year=1898|location=London|page=29}}</ref>

===Oxford===
He left Rugby at the end of 1849 and [[matriculation|matriculated]] at Oxford in May 1850 as a member of his father's old college, [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]].<ref>Clark (1979) 63-64</ref>  After waiting for rooms in college to become available, he went into residence in January 1851.<ref name=clark6465>Clark (1979) 64-65</ref>  He had been at Oxford only two days when he received a summons home. His mother had died of "inflammation of the brain" <U+2013> perhaps [[meningitis]] or a stroke <U+2013> at the age of forty-seven.<ref name=clark6465/>

His early academic career veered between high promise and irresistible distraction. He did not always work hard, but was exceptionally gifted and achievement came easily to him. In 1852 he obtained [[first-class honours]] in Mathematics  [[Moderations]], and was shortly thereafter nominated to a [[Studentship]] by his father's old friend, Canon [[Edward Pusey]].<ref name=collingwood52>Collingwood (1898) p.52</ref><ref name=clark74>Clark (1979) 74</ref>  In 1854 he obtained first-class honours in the Final Honours School of Mathematics, standing first on the list, graduating [[Bachelor of Arts]].,<ref name=collingwood57>Collingwood (1898) p.57</ref><ref name=wilson>Wilson(2008) p.51</ref>  He remained at Christ Church studying and teaching, but the next year he failed an important scholarship through his self-confessed inability to apply himself to study.<ref name=cohen51>Cohen (1995) p.51</ref><ref name=clark79>Clark (1979) 79</ref>  Even so, his talent as a mathematician won him the Christ Church Mathematical Lectureship in 1855,<ref name=frw41>{{cite book | title=Mathematics in Victorian Britain | author1=Raymond Flood | author2=Adrian Rice | author3=Robin Wilson | author3-link=Robin Wilson (mathematician) | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2011 | isbn=0-19-960139-9 |oclc=721931689 | page=41 }}</ref> which he continued to hold for the next twenty-six years.<ref name=cohen414-6>Cohen (1995) pp.414-416</ref>  Despite early unhappiness, Dodgson was to remain at Christ Church, in various capacities, until his death.<ref name="autogenerated1">Leach, Karoline ''In the Shadow of the Dreamchild'' Ch. 2.</ref>

==Character and appearance==
[[File:Lewis Carroll Self Portrait 1856 circa.jpg|thumb|right|Lewis Carroll self-portrait circa 1856]]

===Health challenges===
The young adult Charles Dodgson was about {{convert|6|ft}} tall and slender, and he had curling brown hair and blue or grey eyes (depending on the account). He was described in later life as somewhat [[asymmetry|asymmetrical]], and as carrying himself rather stiffly and awkwardly, although this might be on account of a knee injury sustained in middle age. As a very young child, he suffered a fever that left him deaf in one ear. At the age of 17, he suffered a severe attack of [[Pertussis|whooping cough]], which was probably responsible for his chronically weak chest in later life. Another defect he carried into adulthood was what he referred to as his "hesitation", a [[Stuttering|stammer]] he acquired in early childhood and which plagued him throughout his life.<ref name = "ekfvyz">Leach, Karoline ''In the Shadow of the Dreamchild'' Ch. 2</ref>

The stammer has always been a potent part of the conceptions of Dodgson; it is part of the belief that he stammered only in adult company and was free and fluent with children, but there is no evidence to support this idea.<ref>Leach, p. 91</ref> Many children of his acquaintance remembered the stammer while many adults failed to notice it. Dodgson himself seems to have been far more acutely aware of it than most people he met; it is said he caricatured himself as the [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dodo]] in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', referring to his difficulty in pronouncing his last name, but this is one of the many "facts" often repeated, for which no first-hand evidence remains. He did indeed refer to himself as the dodo, but that this reference was to his stammer is simply speculation.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

Although Dodgson's stammer troubled him, it was never so debilitating that it prevented him from applying his other personal qualities to do well in society. At a time when people commonly devised their own amusements and when singing and recitation were required social skills, the young Dodgson was well equipped to be an engaging entertainer. He reportedly could sing tolerably well and was not afraid to do so before an audience. He was adept at mimicry and storytelling, and was reputedly quite good at [[charades]].<ref name="ekfvyz"/>

===Social connections===
In the interim between his early published writing and the success of the ''Alice'' books, Dodgson began to move in the [[pre-Raphaelite]] social circle. He first met [[John Ruskin]] in 1857 and became friendly with him. He developed a close relationship with [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and his family, and also knew [[William Holman Hunt]], [[John Everett Millais]], and [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], among other artists. He also knew the fairy-tale author [[George MacDonald]] well <U+2013> it was the enthusiastic reception of ''Alice'' by the young MacDonald children that convinced him to submit the work for publication.<ref name="ekfvyz"/><ref name="snaogq">{{Cite book|last=Cohen |first=Morton N. |title=Lewis Carroll: A Biography |pages=100<U+2013>4 |date=26 November 1996 |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-679-74562-4}}{{Page needed|date=February 2009}}</ref>

===Politics, religion and philosophy===
In broad terms, Dodgson has traditionally been regarded as politically, religiously, and personally conservative. [[Martin Gardner]] labels Dodgson as a [[Tory]] who was "awed by lords and inclined to be snobbish towards inferiors."<ref>{{cite book|title=Introduction to The annotated Alice: Alice's adventures in Wonderland & Through the looking glass|last=Gardner|first=Martin|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|year=2000|page=xv|isbn=0-517-02962-6}}</ref> The Reverend W. Tuckwell, in his ''Reminiscences of Oxford'' (1900), regarded him as "austere, shy, precise, absorbed in mathematical reverie, watchfully tenacious of his dignity, stiffly conservative in political, theological, social theory, his life mapped out in squares like Alice's landscape."<ref>{{cite book|title=Introduction to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass|last=Gardner|first=Martin|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|page=xvi|isbn=0-517-02962-6}}</ref> However, Dodgson also expressed interest in philosophies and religions that seem at odds with this assessment.  For example, he was a founding member of the [[Society for Psychical Research]].<ref>Leach, ''In the Shadow of the Dreamchild'' p. 147</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=The place of Lewis Carroll in children's literature | volume=66 | series=Children's literature and culture | author=Jan Susina | publisher=Taylor & Francis | year=2010 | isbn=0-415-93629-2 | page=122 }}</ref>  It has been argued by the proponents of the 'Carroll Myth' that these factors require a reconsideration of Gardner's diagnosis, and that perhaps, Dodgson's true outlook was more complex than previously believed (see 'the Carroll Myth' below).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Dodgson wrote some studies of various philosophical arguments. In 1894, he published a version of his [[Barbershop paradox]] in "Mind" which generated responses from many logicians of his time.<ref>Carroll, Lewis. "Mind", A Logical Paradox. n.s. 3, 436-438.</ref> In 1895, he developed a philosophical regressus-argument on deductive reasoning in his article "[[What the Tortoise Said to Achilles]]", which appeared in one of the early volumes of the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]''. The article was reprinted in the same journal a hundred years later, in 1995, with a subsequent article by Simon Blackburn titled ''Practical Tortoise Raising''.<ref>Carroll, Lewis, "What the Tortoise Said to Achilles", ''Mind'' n.s. 4 (1895), 278<U+2013>280; rpt. in ''Mind'' 104 (1995), 691<U+2013>693. Simon Blackburn, "Practical Tortoise Raising", ''Mind'' 104 (1995), 695 ff.[http://mind.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/104/416/695.pdf]</ref>

==Artistic activities==

===Literature===
From a young age, Dodgson wrote poetry and short stories, both contributing heavily to the family magazine ''[[Mischmasch]]'' and later sending them to various magazines, enjoying moderate success. Between 1854 and 1856, his work appeared in the national publications, ''The Comic Times'' and ''The Train'', as well as smaller magazines like the ''[[Whitby Gazette]]'' and the ''Oxford Critic''. Most of this output was humorous, sometimes satirical, but his standards and ambitions were exacting. "I do not think I have yet written anything worthy of real publication (in which I do not include the ''Whitby Gazette'' or the ''Oxonian Advertiser''), but I do not despair of doing so some day," he wrote in July 1855.<ref name = "ekfvyz"/> Sometime after 1850, he did write [[marionette|puppet]] plays for his siblings' entertainment, of which one has survived, La Guida di Bragia.<ref>{{Citation| title=La Guida Di Bragia, a Balld Opera for the Marionette Theatre| publisher=Lewis Carroll Society of North America| year=2007| chapter=Introduction| author=Peter L. Heath| pages=vii<U+2013>xvi| isbn=0-930326-15-6 }}</ref>

In 1856 he published his first piece of work under the name that would make him famous. A romantic poem called "Solitude" appeared in ''The Train'' under the authorship of "Lewis Carroll". This pseudonym was a play on his real name; ''Lewis'' was the anglicised form of ''Ludovicus'', which was the Latin for ''Lutwidge'', and ''Carroll'' an Irish surname similar to the Latin name ''Carolus'', from which comes the name ''Charles''.<ref name = "kqihew"/> The transition went as follows:
"Charles Lutwidge" translated into Latin as "Carolus Ludovicus". This was then translated back into English as "Carroll Lewis" and then reversed to make "Lewis Carroll".{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

====''Alice'' books====
[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 30.png|thumb|"The chief difficulty [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] found at first was in managing her [[flamingo]]". Illustration by [[John Tenniel]], 1865.]]
[[File:TheJabberwocky.jpg|right|thumb|''The Jabberwock'', as illustrated by [[John Tenniel]] for Lewis Carroll's ''Through the Looking Glass'', including the poem "[[Jabberwocky]]".]]

[[File:Lewis Carroll's Alice drawing.jpg|thumb|right|One of Carroll's own illustrations]]

In the same year, 1856, a new dean, [[Henry Liddell]], arrived at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], bringing with him his young family, all of whom would figure largely in Dodgson's life and, over the following years, greatly influence his writing career. Dodgson became close friends with Liddell's wife, Lorina, and their children, particularly the three sisters: Lorina, Edith and Alice Liddell. He was for many years widely assumed to have derived his own "Alice" from [[Alice Liddell]]. This was given some apparent substance by the fact the [[acrostic]] poem at the end of ''Through the Looking Glass'' spells out her name and also that there are many superficial references to her hidden in the text of both books. It has been noted that Dodgson himself repeatedly denied in later life that his "little heroine" was based on any real child,<ref>Cohen, Morton N. (ed), ''The Letters of Lewis Carroll'', London: Macmillan, 1979.</ref><ref name="nbrhxm">Leach, Karoline ''In the Shadow of the Dreamchild'' Ch. 5 "The Unreal Alice"</ref> and frequently dedicated his works to girls of his acquaintance, adding their names in acrostic poems at the beginning of the text. [[Gertrude Chataway]]'s name appears in this form at the beginning of ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'' and it is not suggested that this means any of the characters in the narrative are based on her.<ref name="nbrhxm"/>

Though information is scarce (Dodgson's diaries for the years 1858<U+2013>1862 are missing), it does seem clear that his friendship with the Liddell family was an important part of his life in the late 1850s and he grew into the habit of taking the children (first the boy, Harry, and later the three girls) on rowing trips accompanied by an adult friend<ref name="Winchester">{{cite book| title=The Alice Behind Wonderland

}}</ref> to nearby [[Nuneham Courtenay]] or [[Godstow]].<ref name="ulsdnc">Leach, Karoline ''In the Shadow of the Dream Child'' Ch. 4</ref>

It was on one such expedition, on 4 July 1862, that Dodgson invented the outline of the story that eventually became his first and largest commercial success. Having told the story and been begged by Alice Liddell to write it down, Dodgson eventually (after much delay) presented her with a handwritten, illustrated manuscript entitled ''Alice's Adventures Under Ground'' in November 1864.<ref name="ulsdnc"/>

Before this, the family of friend and mentor [[George MacDonald]] read Dodgson's incomplete manuscript, and the enthusiasm of the MacDonald children encouraged Dodgson to seek publication. In 1863, he had taken the unfinished manuscript to Macmillan the publisher, who liked it immediately. After the possible alternative titles ''Alice Among the Fairies'' and ''Alice's Golden Hour'' were rejected, the work was finally published as ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' in 1865 under the Lewis Carroll pen-name, which Dodgson had first used some nine years earlier.<ref name="snaogq" /> The illustrations this time were by [[John Tenniel|Sir John Tenniel]]; Dodgson evidently thought that a published book would need the skills of a professional artist. Annotated versions provide insights into many of the ideas and hidden meanings that are prevalent in these books.<ref>Gardner, Martin (2000). "The Annotated Alice. The definitive Edition". New York: W.W. Norton.</ref><ref>Heath, Peter (1974). "The Philosopher's Alice". New York: St. Martin's Press.</ref>

The overwhelming commercial success of the first Alice book changed Dodgson's life in many ways. The fame of his alter ego "Lewis Carroll" soon spread around the world. He was inundated with fan mail and with sometimes unwanted attention. Indeed, according to one popular story, [[Queen Victoria]] herself enjoyed ''Alice In Wonderland'' so much that she suggested he dedicate his next book to her, and was accordingly presented with his next work, a scholarly mathematical volume entitled ''An Elementary Treatise on Determinants''.<ref>Wilson (2008)</ref><ref name=hhgg>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A4462670 |title=Lewis Carroll <U+2013> Logician, Nonsense Writer, Mathematician and Photographer |publisher=BBC  |work=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy |date=26 August 2005 |accessdate=12 February 2009}}</ref>  Dodgson himself vehemently denied this story, commenting "...It is utterly false in every particular: nothing even resembling it has occurred";<ref name=hhgg/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Dodgson |first=Charles |title=Symbolic Logic |year=1896}}</ref> and it is unlikely for other reasons: as T.B. Strong comments in a ''[[The Times|Times]]'' article, "It would have been clean contrary to all his practice to identify [the] author of Alice with the author of his mathematical works".<ref>{{cite news |title=Mr. Dodgson: Lewis Carroll at Oxford |author=T. B. Strong |newspaper=[The Times] |date=27 January 1932}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/language/literary/carroll.asp |title=Fit for a Queen |publisher=Snopes}}</ref> He also began earning quite substantial sums of money but continued with his seemingly disliked post at Christ Church.<ref name="snaogq"/>

Late in 1871, a sequel <U+2013> ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There]]'' <U+2013> was published. (The title page of the first edition erroneously gives "1872" as the date of publication.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cohen |first=Morton |title=Introduction to "Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass"|publisher=[[Random House]] |date=24 June 2009 |isbn=978-0-553-21345-4}}</ref>) Its somewhat darker mood possibly reflects the changes in Dodgson's life. His father had recently died (1868), plunging him into a depression that lasted some years.<ref name="snaogq"/>

====''The Hunting of the Snark''====
In 1876, Dodgson produced his next great work, ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'', a fantastical "nonsense" poem, exploring the adventures of a bizarre crew of tradesmen, and one beaver, who set off to find the eponymous creature. The painter [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] reputedly became convinced the poem was about him.<ref name = "snaogq"/>
====Sylvie and Bruno====
In 1895, 30 years after publication of his masterpieces, Carroll attempted a comeback, producing a two-volume tale of the eponymous fairy siblings. Carroll entwines two plots, set in two alternate worlds, one the fairytale kingdom of Elfland, the other a realm called Outland, which satirizes English society, and more specifically, the world of academia. It came out in two volumes, and is considered a lesser work, although it has remained in print for over a century.

===Photography===
[[File:Alice Liddell 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Photo of Alice Liddell taken by Lewis Carroll (1858)]]

In 1856, Dodgson took up the new art form of photography, first under the influence of his uncle [[Robert Wilfred Skeffington Lutwidge|Skeffington Lutwidge]], and later his Oxford friend [[Reginald Southey]].<ref>Clark (1979) p.93</ref>  He soon excelled at the art and became a well-known gentleman-photographer, and he seems even to have toyed with the idea of making a living out of it in his very early years.<ref name = "snaogq"/>

A recent study by Roger Taylor and Edward Wakeling<ref>{{Cite book|last=Taylor |first=Roger |last2=Wakeling |first2=Edward |title=Lewis Carroll, Photographer |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |date=25 February 2002 |isbn=978-0-691-07443-6}}</ref> exhaustively lists every surviving print, and Taylor calculates that just over fifty percent of his surviving work depicts young girls, though this may be a highly distorted figure as approximately 60% of his original photographic portfolio is now missing, so any firm conclusions are difficult.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  Dodgson also made many studies of men, women, male children and landscapes; his subjects also include skeletons, dolls, dogs, statues and paintings, and trees.<ref>Cohen, Morton (1999). "Reflections in a Looking Glass." New York: Aperture.</ref>  His pictures of children were taken with a parent in attendance and many of the pictures were taken in the Liddell garden, because natural sunlight was required for good exposures.<ref name="Winchester"/>

He also found photography to be a useful entr<U+00E9>e into higher social circles. During the most productive part of his career, he made portraits of notable sitters such as [[John Everett Millais]], [[Ellen Terry]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Julia Margaret Cameron]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Lord Salisbury]], and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]].<ref name = "snaogq"/>

Dodgson abruptly ceased photography in 1880. Over 24 years, he had completely mastered the medium, set up his own studio on the roof of Tom Quad, and created around 3,000 images. Fewer than 1,000 have survived time and deliberate destruction. He reported that he stopped taking photographs because keeping his studio working was difficult (he used the [[Collodion|wet collodion process]]) and commercial photographers (who started using the [[Dry-plate photography#Popularization|dry-plate process]] in the 1870s) took pictures more quickly.
<ref>{{Citation |last=Wakeling |first=Edward |title=An Exhibition From the Jon A. Lindseth Collection of C. L. Dodgson and Lewis Carroll |place=New York, NY |publisher=The Grolier Club |year=1998 |chapter=Lewis Carroll's Photography |pages=55<U+2013>67 |isbn=0-910672-23-7}}</ref>

With the advent of [[Modernism]], tastes changed, and his photography was forgotten from around 1920 until the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Inventions===
To promote letter writing, Dodgson invented ''The Wonderland Postage-Stamp Case'' in 1889. This was a cloth-backed folder with twelve slots, two marked for inserting the then most commonly used penny stamp, and one each for the other current denominations to one shilling. The folder was then put into a slip case decorated with a picture of Alice on the front and the [[Cheshire Cat]] on the back. All could be conveniently carried in a pocket or purse. When issued it also included a copy of Carroll's pamphletted lecture, ''Eight or Nine Wise Words About Letter-Writing''.<ref>Flodden W. Heron, "Lewis Carroll, Inventor of Postage Stamp Case" in ''Stamps'', vol. 26, no. 12, 25 March 1939</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lewiscarrollsociety.org.uk/pages/eventspeopleplaces/inspired/stamps.html |title=Carroll Related Stamps |publisher=The Lewis Carroll Society |date=28 April 2005 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}</ref>

Another invention is a writing tablet called the [[nyctograph]] for use at night that allowed for note-taking in the dark; thus eliminating the trouble of getting out of bed and striking a light when one wakes with an idea. The device consisted of a gridded card with sixteen squares and system of symbols representing an alphabet of Dodgson's design, using letter shapes similar to the [[Graffiti (Palm OS)|Graffiti]] writing system on a [[Palm (PDA)|Palm]] device.<ref>Everson, Michael.(2011)"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland:An edition printed in the Nyctographic Square Alphabet devised by Lewis Carroll". Forward by Alan Tannenbaum, Eire: Cathair Na Mart.</ref>

Among the games he devised outside of logic there are a number of word games, including an early version of what today is known as [[Scrabble]]. He also appears to have invented, or at least certainly popularised, the "doublet" (see [[word ladder]]), a form of brain-teaser that is still popular today: the game of changing one word into another by altering one letter at a time, each successive change always resulting in a genuine word. For instance, CAT is transformed into DOG by the following steps: CAT, COT, DOT, DOG.<ref name = "snaogq"/>

==Mathematical work==
Within the academic discipline of mathematics, Dodgson worked primarily in the fields of [[geometry]], linear and [[matrix algebra]], [[mathematical logic]] and [[recreational mathematics]], producing nearly a dozen books under his real name. Dodgson also developed new ideas in linear algebra (e.g. the first printed proof of the [[Kronecker-Capelli theorem]]),<ref>Seneta, Eugene. (1984) Lewis Carroll as a Probabilist and Mathematician,"Mathematical Scientist",9, 79-84.</ref><ref>Abeles, Francine F. (1998) Charles L. Dodgson, Mathematician." An Exhibition From the Jon A. Lindseth Collection of C.L. Dodgson and Lewis Carroll". New York:The Grolier Club, 45-54.</ref> probability, and the study of elections (e.g., [[Dodgson's method]]) and [[committee]]s; some of this work was not published until well after his death. He worked as the Mathematical Lecturer at Christ Church, an occupation that gave him some financial security.<ref>Wilson (2008), p. 61</ref>

His mathematical work attracted renewed interest in the late 20th century. Martin Gardner's book on logic machines and diagrams, and William Warren Bartley's posthumous publication of the second part of Carroll's symbolic logic book have sparked a reevaluation of Carroll's contributions to symbolic logic.<ref>Gardner, Martin.

==Later years==

Over the remaining twenty years of his life, throughout his growing wealth and fame, his existence remained little changed. He continued to teach at Christ Church until 1881, and remained in residence there until his death. The two volumes of his last novel, ''[[Sylvie and Bruno]]'', were published in 1889 and 1893, but the intricacy of this work was apparently not appreciated by contemporary readers; it achieved nothing like the success of the ''Alice'' books, with disappointing reviews and sales of only 13,000 copies.<ref>Angelica Shirley Carpenter (2002).

[http://www.rightreading.com/writing/dodgsons-dodges.htm "Dodgson's Dodges"]. rightreading.com.</ref>

The only known occasion on which he travelled abroad was a trip to Russia in 1867 as an ecclesiastical together with the Reverend [[Henry Liddon]]. He recounts the travel in his "Russian Journal", which was first commercially published in 1935.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090220131026/http://www.lewiscarroll.org/works.html Chronology of Works of Lewis Carroll] Archived at Wayback Engine. Retrieved 19 September 2013.</ref> On his way to Russia and back he also saw different cities in Belgium, Germany, the partitioned Poland, and France.

He died on 14 January 1898 at his sisters' home, "The Chestnuts" in [[Guildford]], of [[pneumonia]] following [[influenza]]. He was two weeks away from turning 66 years old. He is buried in Guildford at the [[Mount Cemetery]].<ref name = "snaogq"/>

==Controversies and mysteries==
===Suggestions of paedophilia===<!--British subject => British spelling of paedophilia-->

Dodgson's nephew and biographer Stuart Dodgson Collingwood wrote:
:And now as to the secondary causes which attracted him to children. First, I think children appealed to him because he was pre-eminently a teacher, and he saw in their unspoiled minds the best material for him to work upon. In later years one of his favourite recreations was to lecture at schools on logic; he used to give personal attention to each of his pupils, and one can well imagine with what eager anticipation the children would have looked forward to the visits of a schoolmaster who knew how to make even the dullest subjects interesting and amusing.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll | author=Stuart Dodgson Collingwood |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=15-aAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y|year=1898 |publisher=T. Fisher Unwin |location=London}}</ref>
[[File:Hatch, Beatrice (Lewis Carroll, 30.07.1873).jpg|thumb|right|Lewis Carroll portrait of Beatrice Hatch]]
Despite comments like this, Dodgson's friendships with young girls and psychological readings of his work <U+2013> especially his photographs of nude or semi-nude girls<ref name=cohen-166254>{{Cite book|last=Cohen |first=Morton N. |title=Lewis Carroll: A Biography |pages=166<U+2013>167, 254<U+2013>255 |date=26 November 1996 |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-679-74562-4}}</ref> <U+2013> have all led to speculation that he was a [[paedophile]]. This possibility has underpinned numerous modern interpretations of his life and work, particularly [[Dennis Potter]]'s play ''Alice'' and his screenplay for the motion picture ''[[Dreamchild]]'', [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]]'s ''Alice'', and a number of recent biographies, including [[Michael Bakewell]]'s ''Lewis Carroll: A Biography'' (1996), Donald Thomas's ''Lewis Carroll: A Portrait with Background'' (1995), and [[Morton N. Cohen]]'s ''Lewis Carroll: A Biography'' (1995). All of these works more or less unequivocally assume that Dodgson was a paedophile, albeit a repressed and celibate one. Cohen claims Dodgson's "sexual energies sought unconventional outlets", and further writes:
{{quote|We cannot know to what extent sexual urges lay behind Charles's preference for drawing and photographing children in the nude. He contended the preference was entirely aesthetic. But given his emotional attachment to children as well as his aesthetic appreciation of their forms, his assertion that his interest was strictly artistic is na<U+00EF>ve. He probably felt more than he dared acknowledge, even to himself.}}

Cohen notes that Dodgson "apparently convinced many of his friends that his attachment to the nude female child form was free of any [[erotic]]ism", but adds that "later generations look beneath the surface" (p.&nbsp;229).

Cohen and other biographers argue that Dodgson may have wanted to marry the 11-year-old Alice Liddell, and that this was the cause of the unexplained "break" with the family in June 1863.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cohen |first=Morton N. |title=Lewis Carroll: A Biography |pages=100<U+2013>4 |date=26 November 1996 |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-679-74562-4}}</ref> There has never been significant evidence to support the idea, however, and the 1996 discovery of the "cut pages in diary document" (see below) seems to make it highly probable that the 1863 "break" had nothing to do with Alice, but was perhaps connected with rumours involving her older sister Lorina (born 11 May 1849, so she would have been 14 at the time), her governess, or her mother who was also nicknamed "Ina".

Some writers, e.g., Derek Hudson and [[Roger Lancelyn Green]], stop short of identifying Dodgson as a paedophile, but concur that he had a passion for small female children and next to no interest in the adult world.

The basis for scholars' speculation regarding Dodgson's interest in female children has been challenged in the last ten years by several writers and scholars.

==="Carroll Myth"===
Since 1999 a group of scholars, notably [[Karoline Leach]], [[Hugues Lebailly]] and [[Sherry L. Ackerman]], John Tufail, Douglas Nickel and others, argue that what Leach terms the "Carroll Myth" has wildly distorted biographical perception of his life and his work. Those such as Carolyn Sigler and Cristopher Hollingsworth have joined the ranks of those calling for a major reassessment.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Leach's book, ''[[In the Shadow of the Dreamchild]]'', claims that:

* In general terms Dodgson's life has been simplified and 'infantilised' by a combination of inaccurate biography and the longstanding unavailability of key evidence, which allowed legends to proliferate unchecked.
* By the time the evidence did become available the 'mythic' image of the man had become so embedded in scholastic and popular thinking it remained unquestioned, despite the fact the evidence failed to support it.
* If the evidence were examined dispassionately it shows many of the most famous legends about the man (e.g. his 'paedophilia', and his exclusive adoration of small girls) are untrue, or at least grossly simplified.<ref>http://carrollmyth.com/faq.html</ref>

In more detail, Lebailly has endeavoured to set Dodgson's child-photography within the "Victorian Child Cult", which perceived child-nudity as essentially an expression of innocence. Lebailly claims that studies of child nudes were mainstream and fashionable in Dodgson's time and that most photographers, including [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander]] and [[Julia Margaret Cameron]], made them as a matter of course. Lebailly continues that child nudes even appeared on Victorian Christmas cards, implying a very different social and aesthetic assessment of such material. Lebailly concludes that it has been an error of Dodgson's biographers to view his child-photography with 20th- or 21st-century eyes, and to have presented it as some form of personal idiosyncrasy, when it was in fact a response to a prevalent aesthetic and philosophical movement of the time.

Leach's reappraisal of Dodgson focused in particular on his controversial sexuality. She argues that the allegations of paedophilia rose initially from a misunderstanding of Victorian morals, as well as the mistaken idea, fostered by Dodgson's various biographers, that he had no interest in adult women. She termed the traditional image of Dodgson "the Carroll Myth".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carrollmyth.com/ |title=The Carroll Myth |accessdate=12 February 2009}}</ref> She drew attention to the large amounts of evidence in his diaries and letters that he was also keenly interested in adult women, married and single, and enjoyed several scandalous (by the social standards of his time) relationships with them. She also pointed to the fact that many of those he described as "child-friends" were girls in their late teens and even twenties.<ref>Leach, pp. 16<U+2013>17</ref> She argues that suggestions of paedophilia evolved only many years after his death, when his well-meaning family had suppressed all evidence of his relationships with women in an effort to preserve his reputation, thus giving a false impression of a man interested only in little girls. Similarly, Leach traces the claim that many of Carroll's female friendships ended when the girls reached the age of fourteen to a 1932 biography by Langford Reed.<ref>Leach, p. 33</ref>

===Ordination===
Dodgson had been groomed for the ordained ministry in the [[Anglican Church]] from a very early age and was expected, as a condition of his residency at Christ Church, to take [[holy orders]] within four years of obtaining his master's degree. He delayed the process for some time but eventually took deacon's orders on 22 December 1861. But when the time came a year later to progress to priestly orders, Dodgson appealed to the dean for permission not to proceed. This was against college rules and initially Dean Liddell told him he would have to consult the college ruling body, which would almost undoubtedly have resulted in his being expelled. For unknown reasons, Dean Liddell changed his mind overnight and permitted Dodgson to remain at the college in defiance of the rules.<ref>Dodgson's MS diaries, volume 8, 22<U+2013>24 October 1862</ref> Uniquely amongst senior students of his time Dodgson never became a priest.

There is currently no conclusive evidence about why Dodgson rejected the priesthood. Some have suggested his stammer made him reluctant to take the step, because he was afraid of having to preach.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cohen |first=Morton N. |title=Lewis Carroll: A Biography |page=263 |date=26 November 1996 |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-679-74562-4}}</ref>  Wilson<ref>Wilson (2008) pp.103-104</ref> quotes letters by Dodgson describing difficulty in reading lessons and prayers rather than preaching in his own words. But Dodgson did indeed preach in later life, even though not in priest's orders, so it seems unlikely his impediment was a major factor affecting his choice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  Wilson also points out that the then [[Bishop of Oxford]], [[Samuel Wilberforce]], who ordained Dodgson, had strong views against clergy going to the theatre, one of Dodgson's great interests. Others have suggested that he was having serious doubts about Anglicanism.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} He was interested in minority forms of Christianity (he was an admirer of [[Frederick Denison Maurice|F.D. Maurice]]) and "alternative" religions ([[theosophy]]).<ref>Leach, ''In the Shadow of the Dreamchild'' (new edition), 2009, p. 134</ref> Dodgson became deeply troubled by an unexplained sense of sin and guilt at this time (the early 1860s) and frequently expressed the view in his diaries that he was a "vile and worthless" sinner, unworthy of the priesthood,<ref>Dodgson's MS diaries, volume 8, see prayers scattered throughout the text</ref> and this sense of sin and unworthiness may well have affected his decision to abandon being ordained to the priesthood.

===Missing diaries===
At least four complete volumes<ref>Leach, p. 48</ref> and around seven pages<ref>Leach, p. 51</ref> of text are missing from Dodgson's 13 diaries. The loss of the volumes remains unexplained; the pages have been deliberately removed by an unknown hand. Most scholars assume the diary material was removed by family members in the interests of preserving the family name, but this has not been proven.<ref>Leach, pp. 48<U+2013>51</ref> Except for one page, the period of his diaries from which material is missing is between 1853 and 1863 (when Dodgson was 21<U+2013>31 years old).<ref>Leach, p. 52</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Real Lewis Carroll / A Talk given to the Lewis Carroll Society |first=Edward |last=Wakeling |date = April 2003|url=http://www.wakeling.demon.co.uk/page3-real-lewiscarroll.htm |work=1855 ... 1856 ... 1857 ... 1858 ... 1862 ... 1863|accessdate=14 September 2009}}</ref>  This was a period when Dodgson began suffering great mental and spiritual anguish and confessing to an overwhelming sense of his own sin. This was also the period of time when he composed his extensive love poetry, leading to speculation that the poems may have been autobiographical.<ref>Leach p. 54</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Dodgson Family and Their Legacy|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/carroll/dreamchild/dreamchild5.html|accessdate=5 January 2011}}</ref>

Many theories have been put forward to explain the missing material. A popular explanation for one particular missing page (27 June 1863) is that it might have been torn out to conceal a proposal of marriage on that day by Dodgson to the 11-year-old Alice Liddell; there has never been any evidence to suggest this was so, and a paper<ref>Dodgson Family Collection, Cat. No. F/17/1. "[http://www.lewiscarroll.cc/cutpages.html Cut Pages in Diary]{{Dead link|url=http://www.lewiscarroll.cc/cutpages.html|date=September 2009}}". (For an account of its discovery see ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 3 May 1996.)</ref> discovered by [[Karoline Leach]] in the Dodgson family archive in 1996 offers some evidence to the contrary.

[[File:Cutpagesdoc.jpg|thumb|upright|The "cut pages in diary" document, in the Dodgson family archive in Woking]]
This paper, known as the "cut pages in diary document", was compiled by various members of Carroll's family after his death. Part of it may have been written at the time the pages were destroyed, though this is unclear. The document offers a brief summary of two diary pages that are now missing, including the one for 27 June 1863. The summary for this page states that Mrs. Liddell told Dodgson there was gossip circulating about him and the Liddell family's [[governess]], as well as about his relationship with "Ina", presumably Alice's older sister, Lorina Liddell. The "break" with the Liddell family that occurred soon after was presumably in response to this gossip.<ref>Leach, Karoline [http://shadowofthedreamchild.wild-reality.net/ ''In the Shadow of the Dreamchild''] pp. 170<U+2013>2.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lewiscarroll.cc/cutpages.html |work=Looking for Lewis Carroll |title=Text available on-line |accessdate=4 May 2007}}{{Dead link|url=http://www.lewiscarroll.cc/cutpages.html|date=September 2009}}</ref> An alternative interpretation has been made regarding Carroll's rumoured involvement with "Ina": Lorina was also the name of Alice Liddell's mother. What is deemed most crucial and surprising is that the document seems to imply Dodgson's break with the family was not connected with Alice at all. But until a primary source is discovered, the events of 27 June 1863 remain inconclusive.

===Migraine and epilepsy===
In his diary for 1880, Dodgson recorded experiencing his first episode of [[migraine]] with aura, describing very accurately the process of 'moving fortifications' that are a manifestation of the aura stage of the syndrome.<ref>Wakeling, Edward [http://www.wakeling.demon.co.uk] (Ed.) "The Diaries of Lewis Carroll", vol 9 p. 52</ref> Unfortunately there is no clear evidence to show whether this was his first experience of migraine ''per se'', or if he may have previously suffered the far more common form of migraine without aura, although the latter seems most likely, given the fact that migraine most commonly develops in the teens or early adulthood.<ref name="Migraineand">"Migraine and Lewis Carroll"; FW Maudie, in The Migraine Periodical,<issue 17></ref> Another form of migraine aura, [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome]], has been named after Dodgson's little heroine, because its manifestation can resemble the sudden size-changes in the book. Also known as [[micropsia]] and [[macropsia]], it is a brain condition affecting the way objects are perceived by the mind. For example, an afflicted person may look at a larger object, like a basketball, and perceive it as if it were the size of a golf ball. Some authors have suggested that Dodgson may have suffered from this type of aura, and used it as an inspiration in his work, but there is no evidence that he did.<ref name="Migraineand" />

Dodgson also suffered two attacks in which he lost consciousness. He was diagnosed by three different doctors; a Dr. Morshead, Dr. Brooks, and Dr. Stedman, believed the attack and a consequent attack to be an "epileptiform" seizure (initially thought to be fainting, but Brooks changed his mind). Some have concluded from this he was a lifetime sufferer of this condition, but there is no evidence of this in his diaries beyond the diagnosis of the two attacks already mentioned.<ref>"The Diaries of Lewis Carroll", vol 9</ref> Some authors, in particular [[Sadi Ranson]], have suggested Carroll may have suffered from [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] in which consciousness is not always completely lost, but altered, and in which the symptoms mimic many of the same experiences as Alice in Wonderland. Carroll had at least one incidence in which he suffered full loss of consciousness and awoke with a bloody nose, which he recorded in his diary and noted that the episode left him not feeling himself for "quite sometime afterward". This attack was diagnosed as possibly "epileptiform" and Carroll himself later wrote of his "seizures" in the same diary.

Most of the standard diagnostic tests of today were not available in the nineteenth century. Recently, Dr Yvonne Hart, consultant neurologist at the Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, considered Dodgson's symptoms. Her conclusion, quoted in Jenny Woolf's ''The Mystery of Lewis Carroll'', is that Dodgson very likely had migraine, and may have had epilepsy, but she emphasises that she would have considerable doubt about making a diagnosis of epilepsy without further information.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Woolf |first=Jenny |title=The Mystery of Lewis Carroll |pages=298<U+2013>9 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |isbn=978-0-312-61298-6|date=4 February 2010}}</ref>
