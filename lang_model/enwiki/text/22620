{{Politics of Canada}}
The '''foreign relations of Canada''' are [[Canada]]'s [[foreign relations|relations]] with other governments and peoples.  Canada's most important relationship is with the neighbouring [[United States]]{{Fact|date=July 2009}}. However, Canadian governments have traditionally maintained active relations with other nations, mostly through multilateral organizations such as the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth]], [[La Francophonie]], and [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]].

==Early diplomatic history==
The [[British North America]] colonies which today constitute modern [[Canada]] had little control over their foreign affairs until the achievement of [[responsible government]] in the late 1840s. Up to that time, wars, negotiations and treaties were carried out by the British government to settle disputes concerning the colonies over fishing and boundaries and to promote trade.  Notable examples from the colonial period include the [[Nootka Convention]], the [[War of 1812]], the [[Rush-Bagot Treaty]], the [[Treaty of 1818]], the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]], and the [[Oregon Treaty]]. While before the granting of [[responsible government]], diplomacy emphasized peaceful British-American relations as opposed to domestic (Canadian) interests {{Fact|date=July 2009}}. The [[Canadian-American Reciprocity Treaty]] of 1854 signaled an important change in relations between Britain and its North American colonies. In this treaty, the Canadas were allowed to impose tariff duties more favourable to a foreign country than to Britain, a precedent that was extended by new tariffs in 1859, 1879, and 1887 despite angry demands on the part of British industrialists that these tariffs be disallowed by London {{Fact|date=July 2009}}.

Soon after Confederation, the first prime minister Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] appointed Sir [[John Rose, 1st Baronet|John Rose]] as his lobbyist in London. When [[Alexander Mackenzie]] became prime minister, he sent [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]] to represent Canada in Washington during British-American trade talks.  After the Conservative Party came back to power in 1878, the government sent [[Alexander Galt]] to London, as well as to France and Spain. Although the British government was concerned about this nascent Canadian diplomacy, it finally consented to giving Galt the formal title of [[High Commissioner]] in 1880.  A trade commissioner was appointed to Australia in 1894.  As High Commissioner, [[Charles Tupper]] helped negotiate an agreement with France in 1893 but it was countersigned by the British ambassador as the Queen's official representative to France.  Meanwhile, in 1882 the province of Quebec made its first of many forays into the international community by sending a representative, [[Hector Fabre]] to Paris in 1882.

Canada's responses to international events elsewhere were limited at this time.  During 1878 tensions between Britain and Russia, for example, Canada constructed a few limited defences but did little else. By the time of the [[Mahdist War|British campaign in Sudan of 1884-85]], however, Canada was expected to contribute troops.  Since Ottawa was reluctant to become involved, the Governor General privately raised 386 [[voyageurs]] at Britain's expense to help British forces on the [[Nile River]].  By 1885, many Canadians offered to volunteer as part of a potential Canadian force, however the government declined to act.  This stood in sharp contrast to Australia ([[New South Wales]]), which raised and paid for its own troops.

The first Canadian commercial representative abroad was [[John Short Larke]]. Larke became Canada's first trade commissioner following a successful trade delegation to Australia led by Canada's first Minister of Trade and Commerce, [[Mackenzie Bowell]].<ref>[http://geo.international.gc.ca/asia/australia/relations/history-en.asp History of Canada-Australia relations]</ref>

In 1909, Prime Minister Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]] reluctantly established a Department of External Affairs and the positions of Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs, largely at the urging of the Governor General [[Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey|Earl Grey]] and [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]], the British ambassador in Washington, who estimated that three-quarters of his embassy's time was devoted to Canadian-American matters. The [[Alaska boundary dispute]] was resolved by a commission in 1903, at which the British delegate sided with the Americans, stunning Canadians into a realization that the Empire's interests were paramount to Canada's{{Fact|date=July 2009}}.  The Canadian judges refused to sign the award (issued 20 October 1903) as a protest and violent anti-British feeling erupted in Canada.<ref> Hohn 2005</ref>

Due to Canada's important contributions to the British war effort in 1914-18, Prime Minister Sir [[Robert Borden]] insisted that Canada be treated as separate signatory to the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and it subsequently joined the [[League of Nations]]. 

The government operated a Canadian War Mission in Washington D.C. between 1918-1921, but it was not until [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] became Prime Minister in 1921 that Canada seriously pursued an independent foreign policy. In 1923, Canada independently signed the [[Halibut Treaty]] with the United States at Mackenzie King's insistence - the first time Canada signed a treaty without the British also signing it. In 1925, the government appointed a permanent diplomat to Geneva to deal with the [[League of Nations]] and [[International Labour Organization]]. Following the [[Balfour Declaration 1926]], King appointed [[Vincent Massey]] as the first Canadian [[minister plenipotentiary]] in Washington (1926), raised the office in Paris to legation status under [[Philippe Roy]] (1928), and opened a legation in Tokyo with [[Herbert Marler]] as envoy (1929). 

After the outbreak of [[World War 2]] in 1939, Canada rapidly expanded its diplomatic missions abroad. The period from 1945-1957 is considered the golden age of Canadian diplomacy under [[Lester B. Pearson]]{{Fact|date=July 2009}}, when Canada had its greatest impact on world diplomacy{{Fact|date=July 2009}}. 

In 1982, responsibility for trade was added with the creation of the Department of External Affairs and International Trade. In 1995, the name was changed to Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.

Canada has carried out its foreign policy through coalitions and international organizations. It is argued by some critics that Canada no longer carries as much diplomatic weight because of the cut-backs to the military and foreign aid budgets by the government of [[Jean Chr<U+00E9>tien]]{{Fact|date=July 2009}}.

The are two major elements of Canadian foreign relations, Canada-US relations and multilateralism.

==Canada-United States relations==
{{main|Canada-United States relations}}
The [[bilateralism|bilateral]] relationship between Canada and the United States is of extreme importance to both countries.  About 75%-85% of Canadian trade is with the United States, and Canada is the United States' largest trading partner. While there are disputed issues between the two nations, relations are close and the two countries famously share the "[[Canada <U+2013> United States border|world's longest undefended border]]."

Canada and the United States were close allies in both World Wars (though in both cases Canadian involvement preceded US involvement by several years), the [[Korean War]], and the [[Cold War]].  Canada was an original member of [[NATO]] and the two countries' air defences are fused in [[NORAD]].

==Multilateralism==

Canada is and has been a strong supporter of [[multilateralism]]{{Fact|date=July 2009}}. The country is one of the world's leading [[peacekeeping|peacekeepers]]{{Fact|date=July 2009}}, sending soldiers under U.N. authority around the world. Canadian external affairs minister, [[Lester B. Pearson]], is sometimes credited with inventing the modern concept of peacekeeping{{Fact|date=July 2009}}, for which he won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. Canada is committed to disarmament and is especially noted for its leadership in the [[Ottawa Convention]] to ban [[land mine]]s{{Fact|date=July 2009}}.

In the last century Canada has made efforts to reach out to the rest of the world and promoting itself as a "[[middle power]]" able to work with large and small nations alike.  This was demonstrated during the [[Suez Crisis]] when [[Lester B. Pearson]] mollified the tension by proposing [[peacekeeping]] efforts and the inception of the [[UN peacekeeping|United Nations Peacekeeping Force]]. In that spirit, Canada developed and has tried to maintain a leading role in [[peacekeeping|UN peacekeeping efforts]].

Canada has long been reluctant to participate in military operations that are not sanctioned by the [[United Nations]], such as the [[Vietnam War]] or the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 Invasion of Iraq]], but does join in sanctioned operations such as the first [[Gulf War]] and [[Afghanistan]].  It was also willing to participate with its NATO and [[OAS]] allies in the [[Kosovo Conflict]] and in [[Haiti]] respectively.

Despite Canada's track record as a liberal democracy that has embraced the values of the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights|UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], a document chiefly drafted by Canadian [[human rights]] activist [[John Peters Humphrey]]{{Fact|date=July 2009}}, and its commitment to global security, Canada has not been involved in any major plan for [[Reform of the United Nations Security Council]].

Canada hosted the third [[Summit of the Americas]] in [[Quebec City]]. Canada also seeks to expand its ties to [[Pacific Rim]] economies through membership in the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum (APEC). In addition, Canada is an active participant in discussions stemming from the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE). Canada joined the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) in 1990 and has been an active member, hosting the OAS General Assembly in [[Windsor, Ontario]], in June 2000.

==Other bilateral and plurilateral relations==

Canada maintains close links to the [[United Kingdom]] and other [[Commonwealth Realms]], with which Canada has strong historic ties and shares a monarch.  It also remains a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. {{seealso|Canada-United Kingdom relations|Canada-New Zealand relations||Australia-Canada relations}}

Canada also has close, if sometimes turbulent, relations with [[France]]{{Fact|date=July 2009}}, partly for historical and linguistic reasons. {{seealso|Canada-France relations}}

One important difference between Canadian and American foreign policy has been in relations with [[communist]] governments. Canada established diplomatic relations with the [[People's Republic of China]] ([[October 13]], [[1970]]) long before the Americans did ([[January 1]], [[1979]]). It also has maintained trade and diplomatic relations with communist [[Cuba]], despite pressures from the United States.  

Many [[Caribbean Community]] countries turn to Canada as a valued partner{{Fact|date=July 2009}}. Canadians, particularly Canadian banks, played an important economic role in the development of former [[British West Indies]] colonies. Efforts to improve trade have included the idea of concluding a free trade agreement to replace the 1986 bilateral [[CARIBCAN]] agreement. At various times, several Caribbean countries have also considered joining [[Canadian Confederation]] as [[provincial creationism|new provinces or territories]], although no Caribbean nation has implemented such a proposal. {{seealso|Canada-Caribbean relations}}

In recent years Canadian leaders have taken increasing interest in Latin America{{Fact|date=July 2009}}. Canada has had diplomatic relations with [[Venezuela]] since January 1953 and the relations are based on mutual commercial interests, especially in technology, oil and gas industry, telecommunications and others.  Canada has an ongoing trade dispute with [[Brazil]]{{Fact|date=July 2009}}.
{{see also|Canada-Latin America relations}}
{{see|Canada-Venezuela relations|Brazilian-Canadian relations}}

==Administration==
Canada's international relations are the responsibility of the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade]] (DFAIT), which is run by the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canada)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], a position currently held by [[Lawrence Cannon]].  Traditionally the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] has played a prominent role in foreign affairs decisions.  Foreign aid is delivered through the [[Canadian International Development Agency]].

===Federalism and foreign relations===
One of the most unique aspects of Canadian foreign policy is the high level of freedom the provinces have to operate internationally.  Despite the fact the federal government worked to strengthen its foreign affairs responsibilities as relinquished by Britain, the provinces have always had pretensions in this area, dating from Quebec's first representative to France in the 1880s{{Fact|date=July 2009}}.  Most provincial governments have a ministry of international relations, both Quebec and New Brunswick are members of [[La Francophonie]] (separately from the federal delegation), Alberta has quasi-diplomatic offices in Washington (currently staffed by former cabinet minister [[Gary Mar]]).  Provincial premiers were always part of the famous [[Team Canada]] trade missions of the 1990s.  In 2007, Quebec premier Jean Charest proposed a free trade agreement with the [[Canada and the European Union|EU]].

Provinces have always participated in some foreign relations, and appointed agents-general in the United Kingdom and France for many years, but they cannot legislate treaties. The French-speaking provinces of [[Quebec]] and [[New Brunswick]] are members of ''[[la Francophonie]]'', and [[Ontario]] has announced it wishes to join{{Fact|date=July 2009}}. [[Quebec]], ruled primarily by separatist governments since 1976, has pursued its own foreign relations, especially with France. [[Alberta]] opened an office in [[Washington D.C.]] in March 2005 to lobby the American government, mostly to reopen the borders to import of Canadian [[beef]]. With the exception of Quebec, none of these efforts undermine the ability of the federal government to conduct foreign affairs{{Fact|date=July 2009}}.

==Territorial and boundary disputes==

Canada and the United States have negotiated the [[United States-Canada border|boundary]] between the countries over many years, with the last significant agreement having taken place in 1984 when the [[International Court of Justice]] ruled on the maritime boundary in the [[Gulf of Maine]].  Likewise, Canada and France had previously contested the maritime boundary surrounding the islands of [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon|St. Pierre and Miquelon]], but accepted a 1992 [[International Court of Arbitration]] ruling.

Remaining disputes include managed maritime boundary disputes with the US ([[Dixon Entrance]], [[Beaufort Sea]], [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], [[Machias Seal Island]]). Also, there is a dispute with [[Denmark]] over the sovereignty of [[Hans Island]] and surrounding waters in the Kennedy Channel between [[Ellesmere Island]] and [[Greenland]].

===Arctic disputes===
A long-simmering dispute between Canada and the U.S. involves the issue of Canadian sovereignty over the [[Northwest Passage]] (the sea passages in the Arctic){{Fact|date=July 2009}}. Canada<U+2019>s assertion that the Northwest Passage represents internal (territorial) waters has been challenged by other countries, especially the U.S., which argue that these waters constitute an international strait (international waters). Canadians were incensed when Americans drove the reinforced oil tanker Manhattan through the Northwest Passage in 1969, followed by the icebreaker [[Polar Sea]] in 1985, both without asking for Canadian permission{{Fact|date=July 2009}}.  In 1970, the Canadian government enacted the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act, which asserts Canadian regulatory control over pollution within a 100 nautical mile zone.  In response, the Americans in 1970 stated, <U+201C>We cannot accept the assertion of a Canadian claim that the Arctic waters are internal waters of Canada.... Such acceptance would jeopardize the freedom of navigation essential for United States naval activities worldwide.<U+201D> A compromise was reached in 1988, by an agreement on <U+201C>Arctic Cooperation,<U+201D> which pledges that voyages of American icebreakers <U+201C>will be undertaken with the consent of the Government of Canada.<U+201D>  However the agreement did not alter either country<U+2019>s basic legal position.  In January 2006, David Wilkins, the American ambassador to Canada, said his government opposes Stephen Harper's proposed plan to deploy military icebreakers in the Arctic to detect interlopers and assert Canadian sovereignty over those waters.

Relations between Canada and the United States span more than two centuries, marked by a shared [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonial heritage]], conflict during the early years of the [[United States|U.S.]], and the eventual development of one of the most successful international relationships in the modern world. The most serious breach in the relationship was the [[War of 1812]], which saw an American invasion of then [[British North America]] and counter invasions from British-Canadian forces. The border was demilitarized after the war and, apart from minor raids, has remained peaceful. Military collaboration began during the [[World Wars]] and continued throughout the Cold War, despite [[Canada|Canadian]] doubts about certain American policies. A high volume of trade and migration between the U.S. and Canada has generated closer ties, despite continued Canadian fears of being overwhelmed by its neighbor, which is ten times larger in population, wealth and debt.<ref> James Tagg reports that Canadian university students have a profound fear that "Canadian culture, and likely Canadian sovereignty, will be overwhelmed." Tagg, "'And, We Burned down the White House, Too': American History, Canadian Undergraduates, and Nationalism," ''The History Teacher,'' Vol. 37, No. 3 (May, 2004), pp. 309-334  [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1555672 in JSTOR];  J. L. Granatstein. ''Yankee Go Home: Canadians and Anti-Americanism'' (1997)</ref>

|{{flag|Venezuela }}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Canada<U+2013>Venezuela relations]]

In February 1948 there was a Canadian [[Consulate General]] in [[Caracas]] and a Venezuelan Consulate General in [[Montreal]]. In that year the Venezuelan Consul General, on behalf of the government of Venezuela, made a [[rapprochement]] with Canada in order to open direct diplomatic representations between the two countries;<ref> ''Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada'' [http://www.international.gc.ca/department/history/dcer/details-en.asp?intRefid=11327 Documents on Canadian External Relations] Accessed 17 December 2007 </ref> but the Canadian government delayed the opening of a diplomatic mission in Venezuela because of the lack of enough suitable personnel for the manning of a Canadian mission in Venezuela and the impossibility of Canada beginning a representation in Venezuela in that year without considering a policy of expansion of Canadian representation abroad.<ref>''Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada'' [http://www.international.gc.ca/department/history/dcer/details-en.asp?intRefid=11328 Documents on Canadian External Relations] Accessed 17 December 2007 </ref>

In the interest of protecting Canadian trade with Venezuela and considering the difficulties for business in being without a Canadian representation in Caracas, Canada was pushed to accept the Venezuelan offer of exchanging diplomatic missions.<ref>''Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada'' [http://www.international.gc.ca/department/history/dcer/details-en.asp?intRefid=3536   Documents on Canadian External Relations] Accessed 17 December 2007 </ref> Finally Canada elevated the former office of the Canadian Consulate General in Caracas to the category of embassy in 1953.<ref>''The Canadian Embassy in Venezuela'' [http://geo.international.gc.ca/latin-america/caracas/geo/venezuela-bb-en.aspx  Bilateral Relations] Accessed 17 December 2007</ref>

On the other hand Venezuela established an embassy in Canada in 1952.<ref>''Embassy of Venezuela in Canada'' [http://www.misionvenezuela.org/ingles/embajada.htm] Accessed 18 December 2007</ref> Since then there have been good commercial relations between the two countries, especially in technology, oil and gas industry, telecommunications and others.
