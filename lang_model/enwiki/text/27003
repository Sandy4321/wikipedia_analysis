{{KarnatakaHistory}}

The '''Hoysala Empire''' ({{lang-kn|<U+0CB9><U+0CCA><U+0CAF><U+0CCD><U+0CB8><U+0CB3> <U+0CB8><U+0CBE><U+0CAE><U+0CCD><U+0CB0><U+0CBE><U+0C9C><U+0CCD><U+0CAF>}}, {{IPA-kn|hojs<U+0259><U+026D><U+0259> sa<U+02D0>mra<U+02D0>d<U+0292>j<U+0259>|pron|Hoysala_Empire.ogg}}) was a prominent [[South India]]n [[Kannadiga]] [[empire]] that ruled most of the modern day [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Karnataka]] between the 10th and the 14th centuries. The capital of the Hoysalas was initially located at [[Belur]] but was later moved to [[Halebidu]].

The Hoysala rulers were originally from [[Malnad]] Karnataka, an elevated region in the [[Western Ghats]] range. In the 12th century, taking advantage of the internecine warfare between the then ruling [[Western Chalukyas]] and [[Kalachuri]] kingdoms, they ruled over areas of present day Karnataka and some parts of the [[Kaveri River]] delta between [[Kongu (region)|Kongu]] and [[Chola]] territories in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] country. By the 13th century, they governed most of present-day Karnataka, minor parts of [[Tamil Nadu]] and parts of western [[Andhra Pradesh]] in [[Deccan]] India.

The Hoysala era was an important period in the development of art, architecture, and religion in [[South India]]. The empire is remembered today primarily for its temple [[Hoysala architecture|architecture]]. Over a hundred surviving temples are scattered across Karnataka, including the well known [[Chennakesava Temple]] at Belur, the [[Hoysaleswara temple|Hoysaleswara Temple]] at Halebidu, and the [[Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura|Kesava Temple]] at Somanathapura. The Hoysala rulers also patronised the fine arts, encouraging literature to flourish in [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit]].

==History==
[[File:Hoysala emblem.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Sala fighting the tiger, the symbol of Hoysala Empire at [[Belur]], [[Karnataka]].]]

[[Kannada language|Kannada]] folklore tells of a young man, Sala, who saved his [[Jain]] guru Sudatta by striking dead a tiger he encountered near the temple of the Goddess Vasantika at Sosevur. The word "strike" literally translates to "hoy" in [[Kannada literature#Old Kannada (haLegannaDa)|Hale Kannada]] (Old Kannada), hence the name "Hoy-sala". This legend first appeared in the Belur inscription  of Vishnuvardhana (1117), but owing to several inconsistencies in the Sala story  it remains in the realm of folklore.<ref name="legend">Historians feel that Sala was a mythical founder of the empire (Kamath 2001, p123)</ref><ref name="legend1">Derrett in Chopra, Ravindran and Subrahmanian (2003), p150 Part 1</ref> The legend may have come into existence or gained popularity after King Vishnuvardhana's victory over the [[Cholas]] at [[Talakad]] as the Hoysala emblem depicts the fight between the mythical Sala and a tiger, the emblem of the Cholas.<ref name="emblem">The myth and the emblem was a creation of King Vishnuvardhana. Another  opinion is the emblem symbolically narrates the wars between the early Hoysala chieftains and the Cholas, (Settar in Kamath 2001, p123)</ref>

Early inscriptions, dated 1078 and 1090, have implied that the Hoysalas were descendants of the [[Yadu|Yadava]] by referring to  the Yadava ''vamsa'' (clan) as Hoysala ''vamsa''. But there are no early records directly linking  the  Hoysalas to the Yadavas of North India.<ref name="yadava">Quotation:"There was not even a tradition to back such poetic fancy"(William Coelho in Kamath, 2001, p122). Quotation:"All royal families in South India in the 10th and 11th century deviced [[Puranas|puranic]] genealogies" (Kamath 2001, p122)</ref><ref name="yadava1">Quotation:"It is therefore clear that there was a craze among the rulers of the south at this time (11th century) to connect their families with dynasties from the north" (Moraes 1931, p10<U+2013>11)</ref>

Another theory proposed about the origins of Hoysalas is that they belonged to Halumatha (Kuruba) community and Halumatha became Hasala and hence Hoysala.

Historians refer to the founders of the dynasty as natives of [[Malnad]] [[Karnataka]], based on numerous inscriptions calling them ''Maleparolganda'' or "Lord of the Male (hills) chiefs" (''Malepas'').<ref name="male">Rice B.L. in Kamath (2001), p123</ref><ref name="karorg">Quotation:"A purely Karnataka dynasty" (Moraes 1931, p10)</ref><ref name="male1">Keay (2000), p251</ref><ref name="tract">Quotation:"The home of the Hoysalas lay in the hill tracts to the north-west of Gangavadi in Mysore" (Sen 1999, p498)</ref><ref name="male2">Thapar (2003), p367</ref><ref name="west">Stien (1989), p16</ref><ref name="rice">Rice, B.L. (1897), p335</ref><ref name="chop">Natives of south Karnataka (Chopra 2003, p150 Part 1)</ref> This title in the Kannada language was proudly used by the Hoysala kings as their royal signature in their inscriptions. Literary sources from that time in Kannada (''Jatakatilaka'') and Sanskrit (''Gadyakarnamrita'') have also helped confirm they were natives of the region known today as Karnataka.<ref name="early origin">The Hoysalas originated from Sosevuru, identified as modern Angadi in [[Mudigere]] [[taluk]] (Kamath 2001, p123)</ref><ref name="earlyorigin2">An indigenous ruling family of Karnataka from Sosevuru (modern Angadi) (Ayyar 1993, p600)</ref>

The first Hoysala family record is dated 950 and names  Arekalla as the chieftain,  followed by Maruga and Nripa Kama I (976). The next ruler, Munda (1006<U+2013>1026), was succeeded by Nripa Kama II who held such titles as ''Permanadi'' that show an early alliance with the [[Gangas|Western Ganga dynasty]].<ref name="Early Chiefs">Seetharam Jagirdhar, M.N. Prabhakar, B.S. Krishnaswamy Iyengar in Kamath (2001), p123</ref> From these modest beginnings, the Hoysala dynasty began its transformation into a strong subordinate of the [[Western Chalukyas]].<ref name="strong">During the rule of Vinyaditya (1047<U+2013>1098), the Hoysalas established themselves as a powerful feudatory (Chopra 2003, p151, part 1)</ref><ref name="strong10">Sen (1999), p498</ref> Through [[Vishnuvardhana]]'s expansive military conquests, the Hoysalas  achieved the status of a real kingdom for the first time.<ref name="dignity">Sen (1999), pp498<U+2013>499</ref><ref name="dignity1">Quotation:"Reign of Vishnuvardhana is packed with glorious military campaigns from start to finish" (Coelho in Kamath 2001, p124).

According to that record Vishnuvardhana frightened the Cholas, drove the Gangas underground, entered the Nila mountain and became the master of [[Kerala]]. His conquest of the [[Nilgiris district|Nilgiris]] is mentioned in more than one inscription." Quotation:"He captured Talakad which had owed allegiance to the Cholas ever since the days of Rajaraja I". Quotation:"This significant achievement which included Vishnuvardhanas temporary stay in Kanchi is proudly mentioned in Hoysala records".(Chopra 2003, p152<U+2013>153, part 1)</ref><ref name="ganga-chola">Quotation:"Vishnuvardhana was the governor of Gangavadi in the days of his brother and he took serious steps to free parts of Gangavadi, still under the control of the Cholas. He captured Talakadu and Kolara in 1116 and assumed the title ''Talakadugonda'' in memory of his victory" (Kamath 2001, p124)</ref><ref name="talakadugonda">Quotation:"While still engaged in suppressing the Hoysalas, Vikramaditya renewed his designs against Kulottunga; possibly the success of the Hoysalas against the monarch in Gangavadi encouraged him to do so" (Sastri 1955, p175)</ref>

Vishnuvardhana's ambition of creating an independent empire was fulfilled by his grandson Veera Ballala II, who freed the Hoysalas from subordination in 1187<U+2013>1193.<ref name="freedom">Quotation:"In the first twenty years of his rule, he had to fight hard against the [[Nolambas]] and the Kalachuris, the two feudatories of the Chalukya Empire. He entered into a protracted war against the Yadavas and fought successfully against the Kadambas. Emboldened by the decline of the Chalukya empire, he finally declared independence in AD 1193" (Sen 1999, p499)</ref><ref name="freedom10">Quotation:"Ballala vied for glory with his grandfather, and his long and vigorous reign of 47 years saw the achievement of independence which had long been coveted by his forefather" (Prof. Coelho in Kamath 2001, p126)</ref><ref name="imp">Quotation:"It was Ballala's achievement to have consolidated his grandfather's conquests. He may be supposed to have been the founder of a sort of Hoysala imperialism" (Chopra 2003, p154, part1)</ref> Thus the Hoysalas began as subordinates of the [[Western Chalukyas]] and gradually established their own empire in Karnataka with such strong Hoysala kings as Vishnuvardhana, [[Veera Ballala II]] and later [[Veera Ballala III]]. During this time, [[Deccan Plateau|peninsular India]] saw a four way struggle for hegemony <U+2013> [[Pandya]], [[Kakatiya]] and [[Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri]] being the other kingdoms.<ref name="hegemony">Their mutual competition and antagonisms were the main feature during this period (Sastri 1955, p192)</ref> Veera Ballala II defeated the aggressive Pandya when they invaded the Chola kingdom.<ref name="freedom100">Quotation:"He helped the Chola Kulottunga III and Rajaraja III against Sundara Pandya compelling the latter to restore the Chola country to its ruler (AD 1217)" (Sen 1999, p499)</ref><ref name="claimed">Quotation:"A Hoysala king claimed to have rescued the Chola king who had been captured by a tributary Raja" (Thapar, 2003, p368)</ref><ref name="eatablisher">Quotation:"Meanwhile Kulottunga had appealed for aid to Hoysala Ballala II who promptly sent an army under his son Narasimha to [[Srirangam]].

The Hoysalas extended their foothold in areas known today as [[Tamil Nadu]] around 1225, making the city of Kannanur Kuppam near [[Srirangam]] a provincial capital and giving them control over South Indian politics that began a period of Hoysala hegemony in the southern Deccan.<ref name="arbiters">Quotation:"To protect the Chola Kingdom from the harrassing attacks of the Pandyas, Narasimha's son and successor, Somesvara established himself in the south and built a capital at Kannanur about six or eight kilometers from Srirangam" (Sen 1999, p499)</ref><ref name="arbiters100">Quotation:"The Hoysalas were regarded as arbiters of South Indian politics.

The Hoysala influence spread over Pandya kingdom also.<ref>Quotation:"..while Hoysala influence over the whole area of the Chola kingdom and even the Pandya country increased steadily from 1220 to 1245, a period that may may well be described as that of Hoysala hegemony in the south" (Sastri 1955, p195)</ref> Toward the end of 13th century, [[Veera Ballala III]] recaptured territory in the Tamil country which had been lost to the Pandya uprising, thus uniting the northern and southern portions of the kingdom.<ref name="Ballala">Thapar (2003), p368</ref><ref name="unite">Chopra 2003, p156, part 1</ref><ref name="unite10">Sen (1999), p500</ref><ref name="dispute">Kamath (2001), p129</ref>

Major political changes were taking place in the Deccan region in the early 14th century when significant areas of [[North India|northern India]] were under Muslim rule. [[Alla-ud-din Khilji]], the Sultan of Delhi, was determined to bring  isolated [[South India]] under his domain and sent his commander, [[Malik Kafur]], on  a southern expedition to plunder the Seuna capital [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Devagiri]] in 1311.<ref name="kafur">Sastri (1955), pp206<U+2013>208</ref> The Seuna empire was subjugated by 1318 and the Hoysala capital Halebidu (also called Dorasamudra or [[Dwarasamudra]]) was sacked twice, in 1311 and 1327.<ref name="dispute">Kamath (2001), p129</ref>

By 1336, the Sultan had conquered the Pandyas of Madurai, the Kakatiyas of [[Warangal]] and the tiny kingdom of Kampili. The Hoysalas were the only remaining Hindu empire who resisted the invading armies.<ref name="remaining">Sastri (1955), pp212<U+2013>214</ref> Veera Ballala III stationed himself at [[Tiruvannamalai]] and offered stiff resistance to invasions from the north and the [[Madurai Sultanate|Sultanate of Madurai]] to the south.<ref name="stiff">Quotation:"The greatest hero in the dark political atmosphere of the south" (Kamath 2001, p130)</ref> Then, after nearly three decades of resistance, Veera Ballala III was killed  at the battle of Madurai in 1343,<ref name="unite10"/> and the sovereign territories of the Hoysala empire were merged with the areas administered by [[Harihara I]] in the [[Tungabhadra]] region.<ref name="tunga">Chopra (2003), p156, part 1</ref><ref name="commander">While many theories exist about the origin of Harihara I and his brothers, collectively known as the Sangama brothers, it is well accepted that they administered the northern territories of the Hoysala empire in the 1336<U+2013>1343 time either as Hoysala commanders or with autonomous powers (Kamath 2001, pp159<U+2013>160)</ref> This new Hindu kingdom resisted the northern invasions and would later prosper and come to be known as the [[Vijayanagara Empire]].<ref name="patronage">A collaboration between the waning Hoysala kingdom and the emerging Hindu Vijayanagara empire is proven by inscriptions. The queen of Veera Ballala III, Krishnayitayi, made a grant to the [[Sringeri]] monastery on the same day as the founder of the Vijayanagara empire, Harihara I in 1346. The Sringeri monastic order was patronised by both Hoysala and Vijayanagara empires (Kamath 2001, p161)</ref>

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of the Hoysala Empire}}
The Hoysala administration supported itself through revenues from an agrarian economy.<ref name="sagara">Kamath (2001), p132</ref>  The kings gave grants of land as rewards for service to beneficiaries who then became landlords to tenants producing agricultural goods and forest products. There were two types of landlords (''gavunda''); ''gavunda'' of people (''praja gavunda'') was lower in status than the wealthy lord of ''gavundas'' (''prabhu gavunda'').<ref name="gowda">Thapar (2003), p378</ref>  The highlands (''[[malnad]]'' regions) with its [[temperate]] climate was suitable for raising cattle and the planting of orchards and spices. [[Paddy field|Paddy]] and corn were staple crops in the [[tropical]] plains (''Bailnad''). The Hoysalas collected taxes on  irrigation systems including tanks, reservoirs with [[sluice]]s, [[canal]]s and wells which were built and maintained at the expense of local villagers. [[Irrigation tank]]s such as ''Vishnusagara'', ''Shantisagara'', ''Ballalarayasagara'' were created at the expense of the state.<ref name="sagara">Kamath (2001), p132</ref>

Importing horses for use as general transportation and in army cavalries of Indian kingdoms was a flourishing business on the western seaboard.<ref name="horses">Marco Polo who claims to have travelled in India at this time wrote of a monopoly in [[horse trading]] by the Arabs and merchants of South India. Imported horses became an expensive commodity because horse breeding was never successful in India, perhaps due to the different climatic, soil and pastoral conditions (Thapar 2003, p383)</ref> The forests were harvested for rich woods such as [[teak]] which was exported through ports located in the area of present day [[Kerala]]. [[Song Dynasty|Sung dynasty]] records from [[China]] mention the presence of Indian merchants in ports of South China, indicating active trade with overseas kingdoms.<ref name="china">Thapar (2003), p382</ref> South India exported textiles, spices, medicinal plants, precious stones, pottery, salt made from salt pans, jewels, gold, ivory, rhino horn, [[ebony]], [[Agarwood|aloe wood]], perfumes, [[sandalwood]], [[camphor]] and condiments to China, [[Dhofar]], [[Aden]], and [[Siraf]] (the entryport to [[Egypt]], [[Arabia]] and [[Persia]]).<ref name="Persia">Thapar (2003), p383</ref> Architects (''Vishwakarmas''), sculptors, quarry workers, goldsmiths and other skilled craftsmen whose trade directly or indirectly related to temple construction were also prosperous due to the vigorous temple building activities.<ref name="gold">Some 1500 monuments were built during these times in about 950 locations- {{cite web|title=Hoysala Heritage|url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm|author=S.

The village assembly was responsible for collecting government land taxes. Land revenue was called ''Siddhaya'' and included the original assessment (''Kula'') plus various cesses.<ref name="sagara">Kamath (2001), p132</ref> Taxes were levied on professions, marriages, goods in transit on chariots or carriages, and domesticated animals. Taxes on commodities (gold, precious stones, perfumes, sandalwood, ropes, yarn, housing, hearths, shops, cattle pans, sugarcane presses) as well as produce  (black pepper, betel leaves, ghee, paddy, spices, palm leaves, coconuts, sugar) are noted in village records.<ref name="china">Thapar (2003), p382</ref> The village assembly could levy a tax for a specific purpose such as construction of a [[Irrigation tank|water tank]].

In its administrative practices, the Hoysala Empire followed some of the well-established and proven methods of its predecessors covering administrative functions such as cabinet organisation  and command, the structure of local governing bodies and the division of territory.<ref name="govern">Kamath (2001), p130<U+2013>131</ref> Records show the names of many high ranking positions reporting directly to the king. Senior ministers were called ''Pancha Pradhanas'', ministers responsible for foreign affairs were  designated ''Sandhivigrahi'' and the chief treasurer was ''Mahabhandari'' or ''Hiranyabhandari''. ''Dandanayakas'' were in charge of armies and the chief justice of the Hoysala court was the ''Dharmadhikari''.<ref name="govern"/>

The kingdom was divided into  provinces named ''Nadu'', ''Vishaya'', ''Kampana'' and ''Desha'', listed in descending order of geographical size.<ref name="Administration">It is not clear which among ''Vishaya'' and ''Nadu'' was bigger in area and that a ''Nadu'' was under the supervision of the commander (''Dandanayaka'') (Barrett in Kamath 2001, pp 130<U+2013>31)</ref> Each province had a local governing body consisting of a minister (''Mahapradhana'') and a treasurer (''Bhandari'') that reported to the ruler of that province (''Dandanayaka''). Under this local ruler were officials called ''Heggaddes'' and ''Gavundas'' who hired and supervised the local farmers and labourers recruited to till the land. Subordinate ruling clans such as [[Alupas]] continued to govern their respective territories while following the policies set by the empire.<ref name="hereditery">Kamath (2001), p131</ref>

An elite and well trained force of bodyguards known as ''Garudas'' protected the members of the royal family at all times. These servants moved closely yet inconspicuously by the side of their master, their loyalty being so complete that they committed suicide after his death.<ref name="light">Shadow like, they moved closely with the king, lived near him and disappeared upon the death of their master <U+2013> {{cite web|title=Hoysala Heritage|url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm|author=S.

The defeat of the [[Jain]] [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] by the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]] in early 11th century and the rising numbers of  followers of [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Lingayatism]] in the 12th century was mirrored by a decreased interest in [[Jainism]].<ref name="jain">Kamath (2001), p112, p132</ref> Two notable locations of Jain worship in the Hoysala territory were [[Shravanabelagola]] and [[Kambadahalli]]. The decline of [[Buddhism]] in South India began in the 8th century with the spread of [[Adi Shankara]]'s [[Advaita]] philosophy.<ref name="decrease">A 16th century Buddhist work by Lama Taranatha speaks disparagingly of Shankaracharya as close parallels in some beliefs of Shankaracharya with Buddhist philosophy was not viewed favorably by Buddhist writers (Thapar 2003, pp 349<U+2013>350, p397)</ref> The only places of Buddhist worship during the Hoysala time were at [[Dambal]] and [[Balligavi]]. Shantala Devi, queen of Vishnuvardhana, was a Jain but nevertheless commissioned the Hindu Kappe Chennigaraya temple in Belur, evidence that the royal family was tolerant of all religions.

During the rule of the Hoysalas, three important religious developments took place in present day Karnataka inspired by three philosophers, [[Basava]], [[Madhvacharya]] and [[Ramanuja]].

While the origin of Lingayatism is debated, the movement grew through its association with Basava in the 12th century.<ref name="basava">It is said five earlier saints Renuka, Daruka, Ekorama, Panditharadhya and Vishwaradhya were the original founders of Lingayatism, a sect that preaches devotion to [[Shiva]] (Kamath 2001, p152)</ref>
Madhvacharya was critical of the teachings of Adi Shankara and argued the world is real and not an illusion.<ref name="maya">Madvacharya upheld the virtues of Lord [[Vishnu]] and propounded the [[Dvaita]] philosophy (dualism) and condemned the "mayavada" (illusion) of Shankaracharya and maintained there was a distinction between ''Paramathma'' (supreme being) and the dependent principle of life (Kamath 2001, p155)</ref> His philosophy gained popularity enabling him to establish eight [[matha]]s in [[Udupi]]. Ramanuja, head of the Vaishnava monastery in [[Srirangam]], preached the way of devotion (''[[bhakti]] marga'') and wrote ''Sribhashya'', a critique on the [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosophy of Adi Shankara.<ref name="critic">He criticised Adi Shankara as a "Buddhist in disguise" (Kamath 2001, p151)</ref>

[[File:Somanathapura Keshava temple altered.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Vaishnava temple of 1268 CE at [[Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura|Somanathapura]]]]
The impact of these religious developments on culture, literature, poetry and architecture in South India was profound. Important works of literature and poetry based on the teachings of these  philosophers were written during the coming centuries. The [[Saluva Dynasty|Saluva]], [[Tuluva]] and Aravidu dynasties of Vijayanagar empire were followers of Vaishnavism and a Vaishnava temple with an image of Ramanuja exists in the Vitthalapura area of Vijayanagara.<ref name="vij">Fritz and Michell (2001), pp35<U+2013>36</ref> Scholars in the later [[Kingdom of Mysore]] wrote  Vaishnavite works upholding the teachings of Ramanuja.<ref name="vishnu">Kamath (2001), p152</ref> King Vishnuvardhana built many temples after his conversion from Jainism to Vaishnavism.<ref name="chenna">{{cite web|title=Hoysala Temples of Belur |url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/deccan/hoysala/belur.htm|author=K.L.

===Society===
{{main|Society of the Hoysala Empire}}
[[File:Belur shilabalika1.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Dancer, 1117 CE, (''Madanika'') at Belur]]
Hoysala society in many ways reflected the emerging religious, political and cultural developments of those times. During this period, the society became increasingly sophisticated. The status of women was varied. Some royal women were involved in administrative matters as shown in contemporary records describing  Queen Umadevi's administration of  Halebidu in the absence of Veera Ballala II  during his long military campaigns in northern territories. She also fought and defeated some antagonistic [[Feudalism|feudal rebels]].<ref name="progress">This is in stark contrast to the literature of the time (like ''Vikramankadeva Charita'' of Bilhana) that portrayed women as retiring,  overly romantic and unconcerned with affairs of the state (Thapar 2003, p392)</ref> Records describe the participation of women in the fine arts, such as  Queen Shantala Devi's skill in dance and music, and the 12th century [[Vachana]] poet  and  Lingayatism mystic [[Akka Mahadevi]]'s  devotion to the ''bhakti''  movement is well known.<ref name="temporal">She was not only a pioneer in the era of Women's emancipation but also an example of a transcendental world-view (Thapar 2003, p392)</ref> Temple dancers (''[[Devadasi]]'') were common and some were well educated and accomplished in the arts. These qualifications gave them more freedom than other urban and rural women who were restricted to daily mundane tasks.<ref name="deva">Thapar (2003), p391</ref> The practice of [[Sati (practice)|sati]] in a voluntary form was prevalent and prostitution was socially acceptable.<ref name="prostitute">{{cite web|title=Administration, Economy and Society in Hoysala Empire|url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm|author=Arthikaje, Mangalore|publisher=1998<U+2013>2000 OurKarnataka.Com, Inc|work=|accessdate=2006-12-08}}{{dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref> As in most of India, the [[Indian caste system]] was conspicuously present.

Trade on the west coast brought many foreigners to India including Arabs, Jews, [[Persian people|Persians]], Chinese and people from the [[Malay Peninsula]].<ref name="foreign">Sastri (1955), p286</ref> Migration of people within Southern India as a result of the expansion of the empire produced an influx of new cultures and skills.<ref name="migrate">Royal patronage of education, arts, architecture, religion and establishment of new forts and military outposts caused the large scale relocation of people (Sastri 1955, p287)</ref> In South India, towns were called ''Pattana'' or ''Pattanam'' and the marketplace, ''Nagara'' or ''Nagaram'', the marketplace serving as the nuclei of a city. Some towns such as [[Shravanabelagola]] developed from a religious settlement in the 7th century to an important trading center by the 12th century with the arrival of rich traders, while  towns like Belur attained the atmosphere of a regal city when King Vishnuvardhana built the Chennakesava Temple there. Large temples supported by royal patronage served religious, social, and judiciary purposes, elevating the king to the level of "God on earth".

Temple building served a commercial as well as a religious function and was not limited to any particular sect of Hinduism. [[Shaiva]] merchants of Halebidu financed the construction of the Hoysaleswara temple to compete with the Chennakesava temple built at Belur, elevating Halebidu to an important city as well. Hoysala temples however were secular and encouraged pilgrims of all Hindu sects, the Kesava temple at Somanathapura being an exception with strictly Vaishnava sculptural depictions.<ref name="merchant">{{cite web|title=Hoysala Heritage|url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm|author=S.

Irrespective of patronage, large temples served as establishments that provided employment to hundreds of people of various guilds and professions sustaining local communities as Hindu temples began to take on the shape of wealthy Buddhist monasteries.<ref name="loan">Thapar (2003), p389</ref>

===Literature===
[[File:Jain Temple at Halebidu.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Jain temple at [[Halebidu]]]]
{{Main|Literature in the Hoysala Empire}}
Although [[Sanskrit literature]] remained popular during the Hoysala rule, royal patronage of local Kannada scholars increased.<ref name="sagara">Kamath (2001), p132</ref><ref name="inc">Ayyar (1993), p600</ref><ref name="localscholar">Narasimhacharya (1988), p19</ref> In the 12th century some works were written  in the ''Champu'' style,<ref name="mixstyle">A composition which is written in a mixed prose-verse style is called ''Champu'', Narasimhacharya (1988), p12</ref> but  distinctive Kannada  metres  became more widely accepted. The ''Sangatya'' metre used in compositions,<ref name="sangatya">A ''Sangatya'' composition is meant to be sung to the accompaniment of a musical instrument (Sastri 1955), p359)</ref> ''Shatpadi'' (seven line), ''[[Tripadi]]'' (three line) metres in verses and ''Ragale'' (lyrical poems) became fashionable. Jain works continued to extol the virtues of [[Tirthankaras]] (Jain ascetics).<ref name="vogue">Sastri(1955), p361</ref>

The Hoysala court supported scholars such as [[Janna]], Rudrabhatta, Harihara and his nephew  Raghavanka, whose works are enduring masterpieces in Kannada. In 1209, the  [[Jain]] scholar Janna wrote ''Yashodharacharite'', the story of a king who intends to perform a ritual sacrifice of two young boys to a local deity, Mariamma. Taking pity on the boys, the king releases them and gives up the practice of human sacrifice.<ref name="scarifice">Sastri (1955), p359</ref><ref name="jan">E.P. Rice (1921), p43-44</ref> In honur of this work, Janna received the title "Emperor among poets" (''Kavichakravarthi'') from King Veera Ballala II.<ref name="kavichakra">Narasimhacharya (1988), p20</ref>

[[Rudrabhatta]], a [[Smartism|Smartist]] Brahmin, was the earliest well-known [[Brahminical Hinduism|Brahminical]] writer whose patron was Chandramouli, a minister of King Veera Ballala II.<ref name="brahmin">Sastri (1955), p364</ref> Based on the earlier work of ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'', he wrote ''Jagannatha Vijaya'' in  the ''Champu'' style relating the life of Lord [[Krishna]] leading up to his fight with the demon [[Banasura]].

[[Harihara (poet)|Harihara]], (also known as Harisvara) a Lingayati writer and the patron of King Narasimha I, wrote the ''Girijakalyana'' in the old Jain ''Champu'' style which describes the marriage of Lord [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] in ten sections.<ref name="Parvati">Sastri (1955), p362</ref><ref name="Parvati1">Narasimhacharya, (1988), p20</ref> He was one of the earliest Virashaiva writers who was not part of the ''[[Vachana]]'' literary tradition. He came from a family of accountants (''Karanikas'') from Halebidu and spent many years in [[Hampi]] writing more than one hundred ''Ragales'' (poems in blank verse) in praise of Lord Virupaksha (a form of Lord [[Shiva]]).<ref name="har">E.P.Rice (1921), p60</ref> [[Raghavanka]] was the first to introduce the ''Shatpadi'' metre into Kannada literature in  his ''Harishchandra kavya'' which is considered a classic even though it occasionally violates strict rules of Kannada grammar.<ref name="kavichakra"/><ref name="Parvati">Sastri (1955), p362</ref><ref name="har"/>

In Sanskrit, the philosopher [[Madhvacharya]]  wrote ''Rigbhshya''  on [[Brahma Sutras|Brahmasutras]] (a logical explanation of Hindu scriptures, the Vedas) as well as many polemical works rebutting the doctrines of other schools of [[Vedas]]. He relied more on the [[Puranic]] literature than the Vedas for logical proof of his philosophy.<ref name="sutra">Sastri (1955), p324,</ref> Another famous writing was ''Rudraprshnabhashya'' by Vidyatirtha.

{{main|Hoysala architecture}}
[[File:Shrine (Vimana) at Isvara Temple in Arasikere.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Star shaped ''Vimana'', 1220 CE at [[Ishvara Temple (Arasikere)]]]]
The modern interest in the Hoysalas is due to their patronage of art and architecture rather than their military conquests. The brisk temple building throughout the kingdom was accomplished despite constant threats from the Pandyas to the south and the Seunas Yadavas to the north. Their architectural style, an offshoot of the Western Chalukya style,<ref name="mainstream">Hardy (1995), p215, p243</ref><ref name="pre">Kamath (2001), p115, p118</ref> shows distinct [[Dravidian architecture|Dravidian]] influences.<ref name="inf">Sastri (1955), p429</ref> The Hoysala architecture style is described as ''Karnata Dravida'' as distinguished from the traditional ''Dravida'',<ref name="Karnatadravida">Hardy (1995), pp6<U+2013>7</ref> and is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features.<ref name="Temple">Hoysala style has negligible influences of the Indo-Aryan style and owing to its many independent features, it qualifies as an independent school of architecture (Brown in Kamath 2001, p134)</ref><ref name="Temple1">An independent tradition, according to Havell, Narasimhachar, Sheshadri and Settar <U+2013> {{cite web|title=History of Karnataka-Religion, Literature, Art and Architecture in Hoysala Empire|url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm|author=Arthikaje, Mangalore|publisher=1998<U+2013>2000 OurKarnataka.Com, Inc|work=|accessdate=2006-11-17}}{{dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref> There is a connecting link between ''M<U+0101>ru-Gurjara Architecture'' and ''Hoysala Temple Architecture''.

===Language===
[[File:Doddagaddavalli kannada inscription.JPG|right|thumb|upright|[[Kannada]] inscription, 1114 CE at [[Doddagaddavalli]]]]
The support of the Hoysala rulers for the Kannada language was strong, and this is seen even in their [[Epigraphy|epigraph]]s, often written in polished and poetic language, rather than prose, with illustrations of floral designs in the margins.<ref name="floral">Ayyar (2006), p. 600</ref> According to historian Sheldon Pollock, the Hoysala era saw the complete displacement of Sanskrit, with Kannada dominating as the courtly language.<ref name="courtly">Pollock (2006), p. 288<U+2013>289</ref> Temples served as local schools where learned Brahmins taught in Sanskrit, while Jain and Buddhist monasteries educated novice monks. Schools of higher learning were called ''Ghatikas''. The local Kannada language was widely used  in the rising number of  devotional movements to express the ecstatic experience of closeness to the deity (''vachanas'' and ''devaranama''). Literary works were written in it on palm leaves which were tied together. While in past centuries Jain works had dominated Kannada literature, Shaiva and early Brahminical works became popular during the Hoysala reign.<ref name="jainwritings">Narasimhacharya (1988), p17</ref> Writings in Sanskrit included poetry, grammar, lexicon, manuals, rhetoric, commentaries on older works, prose fiction and drama.<ref name="works">The ''Manasollasa'' of king [[Somesvara III]] is an early encyclopedia in Sanskrit (Thapar 2003, p393)</ref> Inscriptions on stone (''Shilashasana'') and [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper plates]] (''Tamarashasana'') were written mostly in Kannada but some were in Sanskrit or were bilingual. The sections of bilingual inscriptions stating the title, genealogy, origin myths of the king and benedictions were generally done in Sanskrit. Kannada was used to state terms of the grants, including information on the land, its boundaries, the participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues, and witnesses. This  ensured the content was clearly understood by the local people without ambiguity.<ref name="bilingual">However by the 14th century, bilingual inscriptions lost favor and inscriptions were mostly in the local language (Thapar 2003, pp393<U+2013>95)</ref>
