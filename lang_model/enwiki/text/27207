== Character History ==
Christian is the little brother of [[Gregor Mann]] (Andreas Jancke). He is just out of prison after he was found guilty of holding up a gas station. But Christian was innocent, because his father, Wolfgang, was the real perpetrator. After he is free, Christian wants to begin a new life in [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf]] with his brother. 
Before long Nico von Lahnstein (Verena Zimmermann) and Coco Faber (Mariangela Scelsi) fall in love with him. Christian doesn't know about Coco's feelings for him and begins a relationship with Nico. Coco suffers and when Christian needs to go back to prison, innocent again, for attacking Nico's boss ,Schuhmann, Nico can't deal with Christian's situation and begs Coco to help her. So Coco writes love letters to Christian in prison and Christian thinks they are from Nico. 
After his release Christian finds out that Coco, and not Nico, wrote to him. Coco can't hide her feelings for Christian any longer and tells him the truth, though she knows that he loves Nico. But Christian begins to feel the same way about Coco and they kiss. When Nico finds out about it, she breaks up with him and sets him free to be with Coco. Christian and Coco are finally happy and enjoy their new love. 

Later, [[Charlie Schneider|Charlie's]] (Gabriele Metzger) nephew [[Oliver Sabel]] ([[Jo Weil]]) comes back to town. Coco and Christian are among his first new friends. However, Christian and Oliver clash when Christian realizes that Oliver is bisexual. Coco and Gregor call him on his behavior and Christian apologizes to Oliver. After a fight with Christian Coco is comforted by Oliver and the two of them share a kiss. While Coco has troubles forgetting about the kiss Oliver develops feelings for Christian. When Christian confronts Oliver about the kiss with Coco, Oliver kisses him to prove that he is really interested in Christian, not Coco. 

Then after Oliver kisses him, Christian becomes confused with his relationship with Coco, even to the extent where when she leaves for Goa, he doesn't go with her because he doesn't 'love her anymore'. Even though he claims publicly that he isn't gay, Christian strikes up a conversation in a gay chatroom about his confusion about the kiss and inadvertedly voices his issues to Oliver, though he doesn't know that this is him yet. Finding out about his chat partner's true identify leads to a heated confrontation which results in Oliver and Christian having sex.

After having sex with Oliver, Christian is still confused he tells Oliver that he isn't interested. However, Oliver doesn't believe him and is sure that he is just hiding his feelings because he's scared. 

They are just friends up until the point that Miriam asks Christian out, after some persuading from Gregor he agrees to go. However, when they get there Oliver is already there dancing with another guy called Rick. Christian doesn't react well when Rick "bumps" into him and ends up starting a fight with Rick. Oliver manages to stop the fight and accuses Christian of being jealous. Christian and Miriam go back to No Limits followed by Oliver and Olivia. Oliver makes a joke about what Christian did and Christian explains he did it because Rick wasn't a nice guy. Christian then tells Miriam that he has a headache and is going upstairs. After some persuading from Olivia, Oliver follows him, but Christian locked himself in his room and won't let Oliver in. Oliver then tells Christian, "I've fallen head over heels in love with you...". Christian eventually unlocks the door, Oliver comes in, and Christian tells Oliver, "I've fallen in love with you", followed by them kissing and having sex. 

In the meantime, Christian, has been given a contract by Wolle, a boxing contractor who hates gay people, so Christian hides his relationship with Oliver. When Christian wants to come clean to everyone, Oliver stops him and resolves to keep their love a secret as long as it takes to get Christian into the boxing world. When Christian falls into the temptation of taking Steroids, Oliver reasons with him and stops him from doing so. Wolle by chance sees the two of them hugging and confronts them to which Christian denies everything and accuses Oliver of making a pass at him. Wolle hits back by making stinging remarks of Oliver and asks him to keep away from Christian. Oliver, although hurt, goes along with Christian's impromptue remarks to secure Christian's boxing career.
Christian, however, soon fires Wolle from his position as marketer, because he continues to interfere in his life, even going so far as to demand he move out to be away from Oliver, as Oliver's image as bisexual may rub off on Christian's own boxing career.

Christian and Oliver are caught by Christian's brother Gregor in bed together, and Christian assumes his brother has reacted badly. However, it turns out that Gregor is not bothered by who his brother is with, so long as Oliver makes his brother happy, and is upset and angry over Christian's lies and low opinion of his character.
Soon after, Christian hires Gregor as his marketer in place of Wolle, and the brothers are once again on good terms. Unfortunately, to keep his image as heterosexual boxer intact not only does his continued relationship with Oliver have to become even more secret, but Judith agrees to become his 'beard'. Effectively, he uses his pretend girlfriend to hide his true relationship, until he can prove his worth as a fighter regardless of his sexuality. 
But the whole "beard" plan does not work out, for Judith's boyfriend, Fabian, becomes insanely jealous. Until Axel, Christian's boxing partner, becomes convinced that Christian is straight, he instigates Christian and Oliver. Luckily, Axel does butt out of Christian's personal life, and his suspicions are put to rest after the "Christian and Judith" story has ended with the two "breaking up".

Finally, after having some couple troubles with Oliver because Christian feels lack of support from him, Christian beats Axel in his first official fight (in which Oliver is present to support him) and comes out by publicly kissing Oliver on the ring.
