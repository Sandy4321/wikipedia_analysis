'''Caius Gabriel Cibber''' (1630<U+2013>1700) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[sculpture|sculptor]], who enjoyed great success in [[England]], and was the father of the actor, author and poet laureate [[Colley Cibber]]. He was appointed "carver to the king's closet" by [[William III of England|William III]].

==Biography==
Cibber was born in [[Flensburg]] in the province of [[Schleswig]] in [[Denmark]].<ref>Ashley, p. 171; Barker, p. 3</ref> His father was a cabinetmaker, supposedly to King [[Frederick II of Denmark]].<ref name=a17>Ashley, p. 17</ref> He travelled to Italy to study art, where he may have changed his name from Sieber to Cibo.<ref>Barker, p. 3</ref> The Cibos were an old and noble Italian family to which [[Pope Innocent VIII]] had belonged.<ref>Ashley, p. 171</ref> Cibber later emigrated to [[London]], [[England]], probably via the Netherlands. At first, he worked for the mason-sculptor John Stone, who had a workshop on [[Long Acre (street)|Long Acre]], until he set up his own studio after Stone's death in 1667.<ref name=a17/>

In 1668, Cibber became a Freeman, by Redemption, of the Worshipful Company of Leathersellers [http://www.leathersellers.co.uk], and in 1679 he became a Liveryman of the same Company, remaining so until his death. He carved a stone mermaid pump for the Company, which stood outside Leathersellers' Hall in Little St Helen's, off Bishopsgate. The mermaid's head survives, having been discovered in excavations at St Helen's Place in 1925.<ref>''Caius Gabriel Cibber: the Leathersellers' most famous sculptor'', by Jerome Farrell, ''The Leathersellers' Review 2005-06'', p.15</ref>

A decade or more after his arrival in London, Cibber married (as his second wife<U+2014>his first wife had died) Jane Colley on 24 November 1670 at [[St Giles in the Fields]], London.<ref>Ashley, p. 17; Koon, p. 194</ref> Jane came from a family of English [[gentry]] who claimed descent from the sister of [[William of Wykeham]], and her grandfather, Sir Antony Colley, had been a prominent [[Cavalier]] during the [[English Civil War]]. They had three children: [[Colley Cibber|Colley]], Lewis and Veronica.<ref>Ashley, p. 18; Barker, p. 4</ref> Between 1673 and 1678, Cibber was detained in [[Marshalsea]] prison for unpaid gambling debts, though he was able to continue his work, and borrowed substantial sums from Edward Colley, his brother-in-law.<ref>Ashley, p. 18; Barker, p. 5</ref>

Many of his works were, or are, on public display in London, including his statue of Charles II (1681), which still stands (rather worn away) in [[Soho Square]]. He made two lifelike human statues in Portland stone entitled "Melancholy" and "Raving Madness" for the gates of the 17th century mental hospital, known as Bedlam (currently [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]]), which can currently be seen in their museum ([[modelli]] in [[V&A]]). They were said to be modelled on two inmates of the asylum, one of whom was [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s mad porter, Daniel.<ref>Ashley, p. 172</ref> The two statues became his most famous work, and were mentioned in [[Alexander Pope]]'s satire ''[[The Dunciad]]''.<ref>Ashley, p. 147; Barker, p. 4</ref> He also created the [[bas relief]]s on the base of the [[Monument to the Great Fire of London]]; his reliefs at the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] have been destroyed. He produced sets of sculpture for [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and for the [[Nordic churches in London#Danish Church|Danish Church]] on [[Wellclose Square]], where he is buried.<ref>Barker, pp. 3<U+2013>4</ref><ref>Harald Faber, ''Caius Cibber 1630-1700: his life and work'', pub. 1926</ref>

== Major works ==
Cibber worked extensively with the architects Sir [[Christopher Wren]] (on [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and [[Hampton Court Palace]]) and [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]] (on [[Chatsworth House]] (1688<U+2013>91) and the version of [[Thoresby Hall]] which was entirely burnt down in 1745).<ref>The Garden at Chatsworth, Deborah Cavendish Devonshire, pp. 14<U+2013>15, 2001, Frances Lincoln Ltd,ISBN 0-7112-1837-4</ref>

Cibber produced a number of excellent [[church monument]]s, including those to the 7th and 8th [[Earl of Rutland|Earls of Rutland]] at [[Bottesford, Leicestershire]], and the extraordinary Sackville monument at [[Withyham]] in [[East Sussex]]. A ''Flora'' in the gardens at Chatsworth has in recent years been returned to the Temple named after her; other large works there include the ''Sea Horse Fountain''.<ref>The Garden at Chatsworth, pp. 14<U+2013>15</ref>
