'''Aaron H. Swartz''' (November 8, 1986&nbsp;<U+2013> January 11, 2013) was an [[United States|American]] computer programmer, writer, political organizer and [[Hacktivism|Internet activist]].

Swartz was a member of the [[RSS-DEV Working Group]] that co-authored the "RSS 1.0" specification of [[RSS]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Introdution: Aaron Swartz|url= http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Apr/0062.html|accessdate= Jan 13, 2013}}</ref> built the website framework web.py<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webpy.org/ |title=Web.py | type = official site | accessdate=January 16, 2013}}</ref> and created the architecture for the [[Open Library]]. In the early days of [[Reddit]], Swartz's [[Infogami]] and Reddit merged; the merger agreement made Swartz an equal partner in the merged company.{{ref label|merger|i|}} 

Swartz also focused on sociology, civic awareness and activism.<ref>{{cite web|last=Swartz |first=Aaron |url = http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/socvanthro |title=Sociology or Anthropology (Aaron Swartz's Raw Thought) |publisher=Aaronsw.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Swartz |first=Aaron |url= http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/socfunc | title = Simplistic Sociological Functionalism (Aaron Swartz's Raw Thought) |publisher=Aaronsw.com |date=2008-05-13 |accessdate=2013-01-16}}</ref> In 2010 he joined the [[Harvard University]] Center for Ethics. He cofounded the online group [[Demand Progress]] (known for its campaign against the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]]) and later worked with U.S. and international activist groups [[Rootstrikers]] and [[Avaaz]].

On January 6, 2011, Swartz was arrested by federal authorities in connection with systematic downloading of [[academic journal]] articles from [[JSTOR]].<ref name=2011-tech/><ref name="2011-poblotter" /> Swartz opposed JSTOR's practice of compensating publishers, rather than authors, out of the fees it charges for access to articles. Swartz contended that JSTOR's fees limited access to academic work produced at American colleges and universities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Swartz <U+201C>Steals<U+201D> for Science |url=http://scienceprogress.org/2011/07/swartz-%E2%80%9Csteals%E2%80%9D-for-science/|accessdate=Jan 13, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The inspiring heroism of Aaron Swartz|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jan/12/aaron-swartz-heroism-suicide1 |accessdate=Jan 13, 2013}}</ref>

Two years later, on the morning of January 11, 2013, Swartz was found hanged in his [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]], [[Brooklyn]] apartment, an apparant suicide.<ref>{{Cite news

[[File:Aaron Swartz and Lawrence Lessig.jpg|thumbnail|right|Swartz in 2002 (age 15) with [[Lawrence Lessig]] at the launch party for [[Creative Commons]]]]

The prize included a trip to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and meetings with Internet notables. At the age of 14, Swartz was collaborating with experts in networking standards as a member of the working group that authored the [[RSS|RSS 1.0 Specification]], a lesser-used offshoot of the earlier RSS 0.92 specification.<ref>{{cite web|last=Holzner |first=Steven |url=http://www.peachpit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=674690 |title=Peachpit | type = article | accessdate= 2010-12-11}}</ref> Writing in [[Yahoo! | Yahoo!

===W3C===
Swartz served on the [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] Core working group at the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/members.html |title=RDFCore Working Group Membership |publisher=W3.org |date=2002-12-01 |accessdate=2013-01-15}}</ref> and authored [[Request for Comments|RFC]] 3870, defining the RDF XML [[Content-type|content type]].<ref>[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3870 Application/rdf+xml Media Type Registration]</ref>

===Infogami and Reddit=== 
He later attended [[Stanford University]], but left after just one year.<ref name="Life Story"/> Instead he founded the software company Infogami, a [[startup company|startup]] that was funded by [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]]'s first Summer Founders Program.<ref name=wired />

Through the Y Combinator program, Swartz started the wiki platform Infogami (later used to support the web.py and [[Open Library]] sites), but felt he needed co-founders to proceed. Y-Combinator organizers suggested that Infogami merge with [[Reddit]],<ref name="infogami2007">{{Citation | url = http://infogami.com/blog/introduction | archivedate = 2007<U+2010>12<U+2010>24 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071224194042/http://infogami.com/blog/introduction | title = Infogami | contribution = Introduction}}</ref><ref name="startup">{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070823200504/http://startupstories.com/2006/11/29/passion-for-your-users-will-come-back-alexis-ohanian-co-founder-of-reddit/ |archivedate=August 8, 2007 |title=Passion for your users will come back: Alexis Ohanian, cofounder of Reddit |publisher=Startup stories |date=November 11, 2006 |url= http://startupstories.com/2006/11/29/passion-for-your-users-will-come-back-alexis-ohanian-co-founder-of-reddit/}}</ref> which it did in November 2005.<ref name="infogami2007"/><ref name="Wired-arrest" />  While Reddit initially found it difficult to make money from the project, the site later gained in popularity, with millions of users visiting it each month.  In late 2006, after months of negotiations, Reddit was sold to [[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications]], owners of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine.<ref name="Life Story"/> Swartz moved with his company to San Francisco to work on Wired, but grew unhappy with the set-up<ref name="Life Story"/> and in January, 2007, he was asked to resign from his position.<ref name="A Chat with Aaron Swartz"/> Swartz described himself as being ill and suffering from a constant depressed mood throughout 2007.<ref name="Sick">{{cite web | last= Aaron | first = Swartz | title = Sick|url = http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/verysick | type = weblog |accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref> In September, 2007, Swartz joined with Simon Carstensen and launched Jottit. In 2010<U+2013>2011 he was a fellow at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Edmond Safra | Edmond J. Safra]] Center for Ethics.<ref name=ibt />

Swartz was also the creator of the web.py [[Web application framework]],<ref name=infowo/> and co-founded Demand Progress,<ref name=ibt/> a progressive advocacy group that organizes people via email and other media for "contacting Congress and other leaders, funding pressure tactics, and spreading the word" about targeted issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.demandprogress.org/mission |title=Our Mission <U+2014> Demand Progress |publisher=Blog.demandprogress.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-15}}</ref>

===Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA)===
[[File:AaronSwartzPIPA.jpg|thumb|right|Swartz in 2012 protesting against [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] (SOPA)]]
Swartz was significantly involved with a campaign to prevent the passing of the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] (SOPA) bill that sought to monitor the Internet for copyright violations and would have made it easier for the U.S. government to shut down websites accused of violating copyright.<ref name="stuff1"/>

Following the defeat of the bill, Swartz was the keynote speaker at the F2C:Freedom to Connect 2012 event in Washington, D.C., on May 21, 2012. His speech was titled "How we stopped SOPA"<ref name="F2c2">{{cite web|title=F2C2012: Aaron Swartz keynote - "How we stopped SOPA"|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgh2dFngFsg|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=13 January 2013|author=F2C2012|format=Video upload|date=22|month=May|year=2012}}</ref> and he informed the audience:

<blockquote>There's a battle going on right now, a battle to define everything that happens on the internet in terms of traditional things that the law understands... [Under SOPA], new technology, instead of bringing us greater freedom, would have snuffed out fundamental rights we'd always taken for granted.<ref name="stuff1"/></blockquote>

Swartz said SOPA was defeated by "the people themselves... We won this fight because everyone made themselves the hero of their own story. Everyone took it as their job to save this crucial freedom."<ref name="F2c2"/>{{Primary source-inline|date=January 2013}} He was referring to a series of protests against the bill by numerous websites which were described by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] as the biggest in Internet history, with over 115 thousand sites altering their webpages.<ref>[http://rt.com/news/sopa-postponed-anonymous-piracy-337/ Bill Killed: SOPA death celebrated as Congress recalls anti-piracy acts]; Russian Times; January 19, 2012</ref>

In his speech Swartz also described how close the Bill came to passing as a "bad dream". He added: <blockquote>And it will happen again; sure, it will have another name, and maybe a different excuse, and probably do its damage in a different way, but make no mistake, the enemies of the freedom to connect have not disappeared. The fire in those politician's eyes has not been put out. There are a lot of people, a lot of powerful people, who wanna clamp down on the Internet.<ref name="F2c2" />{{Primary source-inline|date=January 2013}}</blockquote>

Swartz also presented on this topic at an event organized by ThoughtWorks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aaron Swartz: How We Stopped SOPA|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl0vHBsapBc|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=13 January 2013|author=Joe Friendly|format=Video upload|date=17|month=August|year=2012}}</ref>

===Wikipedia===
[[File:Aaron Swartz at Boston Wikipedia Meetup, 2009-08-18 .jpg|thumb|Swartz at 2009 Boston Wikipedia Meetup]]
Swartz volunteered as an editor at [[Wikipedia]], and in 2006, he ran for the [[Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation's]] Board of Directors, but was unsuccessful. Also in 2006, Swartz wrote an analysis of how Wikipedia articles are written, and concluded that the bulk of the actual content comes from tens of thousands of occasional contributors, or "outsiders," each of whom may not make many other contributions to the site,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.businessinsider.com/2009/1/who-the-hell-writes-wikipedia-anyway | title = Who The Hell Writes Wikipedia, Anyway?|author-link = Henry Blodget | first = Henry | last = Blodget |publisher=[[Business Insider]]|date=January 3, 2009|accessdate = January 12, 2013}}</ref> while a core group of 500 to 1,000 regular editors tend to correct spelling and other formatting errors. According to Swartz: "The formatters aid the contributors, not the other way around."<ref name="whowriteswikipedia">{{cite web |url = http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia |title = Who Writes Wikipedia? (Aaron Swartz's Raw Thought) |author=Aaron Swartz |date=September 4, 2006 |accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref> 

His analysis contradicted that of Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]], who believed the core group of regular editors were providing most of the content while thousands of others contributed to formatting issues. Swartz came to his conclusions by counting the total number of characters added by an editor to a particular article <U+2014> while Wales counted the total number of edits. Swartz's analysis is described on his blog post and was part of his unsuccessful bid to be elected to Wikimedia's Board of Directors.<ref>{{cite web|last=Swartz |first=Aaron |url=http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia |title=Who Writes Wikipedia? |publisher=Aaronsw.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-15}}</ref>

===Library of Congress===

Around 2006, Swartz acquired the [[Library of Congress]]'s complete bibliographic dataset: the library charged fees to access this, but as a government document, it was not copyright-protected within the USA. By posting the data in the [[Open Library]], Swartz made it freely available.<ref>G. F., 'Commons man: Remembering Aaron Swartz', ''The Economist'', Jan 13th 2013, www.economist.com/node/21569550.</ref>

==Investigations and prosecution==
===PACER===
In 2008, Swartz downloaded, and released, approximately 20% of the Public Access to Court Electronic Records [[PACER (law)|(PACER)]] database of [[United States federal courts|United States federal court]] documents managed by the [[Administrative Office of the United States Courts]].<ref name = "Schwartz2009" /> 

PACER was charging 8 cents per page for information that [[Carl Malamud]], who founded the nonprofit group [[Public.resource.org]], contended should be free, because government-produced documents are not covered by copyright.<ref name = "Schwartz2009" /><ref name="Singel2009" /> The fees were "...plowed back to the courts to finance technology, but the system [ran] a budget surplus of some $150 million, according to court reports," reported the [[New York Times]].<ref name = "Schwartz2009" /> PACER used technology that was "...designed in the bygone days of screechy telephone modems... put[ting] the nation<U+2019>s legal system behind a wall of cash and kludge."<ref name = "Schwartz2009" /> Malamud appealed to fellow activists, urging them to visit one of 17 libraries conducting a free trial of the PACER system, download court documents, and send them to him for public distribution.<ref name = "Schwartz2009" /><ref name="Singel2009" />

After reading Malamud<U+2019>s call for action,<ref name="Schwartz2009" /> Swartz visited the [[7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] library in Chicago and installed a [[Scripting language#General-purpose dynamic languages|Perl computer script]].<ref name="Singel2009" /> From September 4-20, 2008, it accessed approximately 18,000,000 documents and uploaded them to a [[cloud computing]] service.<ref name="Singel2009"/> He donated the documents, amounting to 19,856,160 pages, to Malamud's public.resource.org.<ref name="Singel2009"/>

On September 29, 2008,<ref name = "Schwartz2009" /> the GPO suspended the free trial, "pending an evaluation" of the program.<ref name = "Schwartz2009" /><ref name="Singel2009" /> Swartz's actions were subsequently investigated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].<ref name = "Schwartz2009" /><ref name="Singel2009" /> The case was closed after two months with no charges filed.<ref name="Singel2009" /> Swartz learned the details of the investigation as a result of filing a [[Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request with the FBI and described their response as the "...usual mess of confusions that shows the FBI<U+2019>s lack of sense of humor."<ref name="Singel2009" />  PACER still charges per page, but customers using [[Firefox]] have the option of donating documents into the public domain with a plug-in called RECAP.<ref name="Singel2009" />

===JSTOR===
{{pov_section|date=January 2013}}
In late 2010 and early 2011, Swartz downloaded about 4 million of [[JSTOR]]'s collection of [[Academic journal|academic journal]] articles <U+2014> which provides a limited number of articles to students and researchers free of charge. Swartz was a faculty member at [[Harvard University]] which provided him with a JSTOR account. Over the course of a few weeks, he downloaded the documents from a network wiring closet at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and, in the process, crashed some of JSTOR's servers.<ref>{{cite web|author=JAY LINDSAY - [[Associated Press]] |url=http://news.yahoo.com/feds-harvard-fellow-hacked-millions-papers-203301454.html |title=Feds: Harvard fellow hacked millions of papers |publisher=[[Yahoo!

In 2011, the New York Times wrote of the case: "A respected Harvard researcher who also is an Internet folk hero has been arrested in Boston on charges related to computer hacking, which are based on allegations that he downloaded articles that he was entitled to get free."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/us/20compute.html? |title=Open-Access Advocate Is Arrested for Huge Download |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=July 19, 2011 |accessdate=2013-01-16}}</ref>

On July 19, 2011, Swartz was charged by [[Carmen Ortiz]], the [[U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts]], with [[wire fraud]], [[computer fraud]], unlawfully obtaining information from a [[protected computer]] and recklessly damaging a protected computer.<ref name="Internet Activist Charged in Data Theft"/> According to the indictment against him, Swartz surreptitiously attached a laptop to MIT's computer network, which allowed him to "rapidly download an extraordinary volume of articles from JSTOR."<ref name="CB1"/> Prosecutors in the case claimed Swartz acted with the intention of making the papers available on [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P file-sharing sites]].<ref name="Feds: Harvard fellow hacked millions of papers" />  

Swartz surrendered to authorities, pleading not guilty on all accounts, and was released on US$100,000 unsecured bail.<ref name="open-access-adv"/> After his arrest, JSTOR put out a statement saying it would not pursue civil litigation against him,<ref name="jstor-statement"/><ref name="open-access-adv" />  while MIT did not comment on the proceedings.<ref name="Lessig_20130113">{{cite web|last=Lessig|first=Lawrence|title=Prosecutor as bully|url=http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40347463044/prosecutor-as-bully|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref>  Prosecution of the case continued, with charges of wire fraud and computer fraud, carrying a potential prison term of up to 35 years and a fine of up to $1 million.<ref name=crln/><ref name=techdirt/> One of Swartz's lawyers revealed prosecutors "told him two days before Swartz<U+2019>s death that Swartz would have to spend six months in prison and plead guilty to [all] 13 charges" in order to avoid trial.<ref name="Post_20130113">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/young-tech-pioneers-suicide-raises-questions-about-how-harshly-to-prosecute-computer-crimes/2013/01/13/496c2072-5de9-11e2-8acb-ab5cb77e95c8_story.html|title=Mass. lawyer says he told federal prosecutors Internet activist Swartz was suicide risk|agency=Associated Press|date=2013-01-13|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}</ref>  After Swartz's death, his attorney Marty Weinberg told press that he "nearly negotiated a plea bargain in which Swartz would not serve any time", but that bargain failed because "JSTOR signed off on it, but MIT would not."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/01/15/humanity-deficit/bj8oThPDwzgxBSHQt3tyKI/story.html?s_campaign=sm_tw |title=On humanity, a big failure in Aaron Swartz case - Metro |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=January 15, 2013 |accessdate=2013-01-16}}</ref>

Elliot Peters, Swartz's attorney, said his father was "outraged by the university's handling of the matter, believing that it deviated from MIT's usual procedures".<ref name="stuff1"/> The family and partner of Swartz created a memorial Web site on which they issued a statement, saying, "He used his prodigious skills as a programmer and technologist not to enrich himself but to make the Internet and the world a fairer, better place."<ref name="remember"/>{{Primary source-inline|date=January 2013}}

Swartz was eulogized by his friend and sometime attorney, [[Lawrence Lessig]], calling his prosecution an abuse of [[Proportionality (law)|proportionality]] and noting, "the question this government needs to answer is why it was so necessary that Aaron Swartz be labeled a 'felon'."<ref name="lessig-obituary" /> Author [[Cory Doctorow]] wrote: "Aaron had an unbeatable combination of political insight, technical skill, and intelligence about people and issues.

Swartz's funeral services were held on January 15, 2013, at Central Avenue Synagogue in [[Highland Park, Illinois]]. [[Tim Berners-Lee]], the creator of the World Wide Web and perhaps Swartz's most admired role-model, delivered a eulogy at the service.<ref>Gallardo, Michelle, Janurary 15, 2013, [http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&id=8955254 Aaron Swartz, Reddit co-founder, remembered at funeral], ABC News, Retrieved January 15, 2013</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Owen Thomas | Jan. 12, 2013, 6:21 PM | 16,301 | 21 |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/statement-family-aaron-swartz-2013-1 |title=Family Of Aaron Swartz Blames MIT, Prosecutors For His Death |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-15}}</ref>

===Public response===
Kelly Caine, a professor at [[Clemson University]] who studies people's attitudes toward technology and privacy said Swartz "was doing this not to hurt anybody, not for personal gain, but because he believed that information should be free and open, and he felt it would help a lot of people."<ref name="stuff1"/>  [[Chris Soghoian]], a technologist and policy analyst with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], said: "Existing laws don't recognise the distinction between two types of computer crimes: malicious crimes committed for profit, such as the large-scale theft of bank data or corporate secrets; and cases where hackers break into systems to prove their skillfulness or spread information that they think should be available to the public. The government used the same laws intended to go after digital bank robbers to go after this 26-year-old genius."<ref name="stuff1"/> Technology writer Verena Dobnik wrote that "His case highlights society's uncertain, evolving view of how to treat people who break into computer systems and share data not to enrich themselves, but to make it available to others."<ref name="stuff1">{{cite web |author=Verena Dobnik |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/8174527/Reddit-co-founder-dies-weeks-before-trial |title=Reddit co-founder dies weeks before trial |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-01-15}}</ref>

====Open Access====
Swartz was a long-time supporter of [[Open Access]], writing:
