'''''Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury''''' is a 1906 [[oil on canvas]] painting by [[Albert Chevallier Tayler]]. It was commissioned by [[Kent County Cricket Club]] to celebrate their first [[County Championship]] title win.<ref name=sell>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/story/251684.html |title=Kent sell classic painting for <U+00A3>600,000 |publisher=ESPN |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref> In 2006 Kent sold the painting<ref name=feat /> to a charity foundation at auction and it is currently displayed at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] in London, England.<ref name=m />

== Background ==
Kent won the [[1906 County Championship]] with 77.77% of finished matches, 7.78% ahead of the 70.00% achieved by second-place [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/0/County_Championship_1906.html|title=County Championship 1906 table |publisher=Cricket Archive |date= |accessdate=2014-05-06}}</ref> This was their first victory since the County Championship was instituted in 1890. At a celebratory dinner in London, Kent's chairman [[George Harris, 4th Baron Harris]], recommended that Kent's members commission a painting to celebrate the achievement. Lord Harris suggested that it should be an action shot and that it must be of a match at the [[St Lawrence Ground]], [[Canterbury]], and that the [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]] in the painting must be Kent's [[Colin Blythe]].<ref name=ct>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/228980.html |title=A Canterbury tale |publisher=ESPN |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref> Tayler was selected as the artist; he had previously painted an image of Lord Harris batting for Kent in 1905. Tayler was paid 200 [[guinea]]s by Kent for the painting, and reproduction rights had the potential to increase the total amount to as much as 350 guineas. Since only three matches had been played at Canterbury by Kent during the season, it was decided that the subject of the painting would be Kent's match against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]] at the [[Canterbury Cricket Week]], at which Blythe had taken eight wickets. Tayler decided that he would depict the second day of the match, at an hour prior to lunchtime.<ref name=ct />

Tayler, wanting to ensure accuracy of the painting, arranged sittings with the Kent team to ensure he depicted the faces so they were recognizable. He also intended to do the same with the non-striking Lancashire [[batsman (cricket)|batsman]], [[Harry Makepeace]]. Makepeace was unable to attend a sitting, so Tayler compromised by using another Lancashire player, [[William Findlay (cricketer)|William Findlay]], as the batsman. Findlay had not actually played in that particular match, but he was able to travel to Tayler's London studio as he had been newly appointed as secretary of [[Surrey County Cricket Club]] after his retirement as a cricket player at the end of 1906.<ref name=ct />

== History ==
Tayler completed the painting in 1907. 192 advance engravings of the painting had been ordered by the time it had been finished, which ensured that Tayler's charges were covered. When the painting was unveiled, it became popular and was praised for its accuracy as well as it use of light and shading.<ref name=book>{{cite book | first =Stella | last = Walker  | title =British sporting art in the twentieth century | publisher = Sportsman's Press | edition = | year = 1989| isbn = 0948253363 | page = 185}}</ref> In 1908, a limited print signed by Tayler and Lord Harris was created; further prints were made by Kent in 1990 and 2000, and each was signed by current players of their respective times including [[Colin Cowdrey]], [[E.W. Swanton]], [[Les Ames]] and [[Matthew Fleming]]. As a result of its popularity, the painting was lent out to be displayed at [[Rectory Field]], [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], and it was also lent to Lord's Cricket Ground, London.<ref name=ct /> The painting is viewed by cricket fans and historians as a colourful reminder of the [[Golden Age of cricket]] in the Victorian and Edwardian periods before the [[First World War]].<ref name=ct /> Cricket historian [[E. W. Swanton]] praised the painting, singling it out as "one of the finest ever portrayals of distinguished identifiable cricketers in action".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/255236.html |title=Blythe's canvas immortality |publisher=ESPN |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref>  

The painting was predominantly displayed in the pavilion of the St Lawrence Ground. However, in 1999 it was lent to [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] after Kent were unable to afford the insurance for it.<ref name=feat /> The MCC hung the painting in the [[Lord's Pavilion]] at Lord's while Kent retained one of the prints for display in the St Lawrence Ground pavilion in place of the original.<ref name=feat /><ref>{{cite book | first =Duncan | last = Hamilton  | title =A Last English Summer: The Biography of a Cricket Season | publisher = Quercus | edition = | year = 2011| isbn = 0857383043 | chapter = Afterword: A very perfect gentle knight}}</ref> In 2005, with Kent having large debts,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4811060.stm |title=Cricket club getting <U+00A3>7m revamp |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-03-16 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref> the club announced that they were planning to sell the painting.<ref name=ct /> When questioned by Kent members about the proposed sale, Kent chairman [[Carl Openshaw]] said that it was being done because he felt the painting no longer benefitted the cricket club and because many of Kent's members already owned reproductions of the painting.<ref name=km>{{cite web|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent/news/cricket-club-may-sell-100-year-o-a21709/ |title=Cricket club may sell 100-year-old painting |publisher=Kent Online |date=2005-12-01 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref> Openshaw also stated that the painting would not be sold if it did not achieve an "appropriate sum".<ref name=km /> The painting was auctioned at [[Sotheby's]] in 2006.

== Description ==
The painting was done from the boundary of the Nackington Road end of the St Lawrence Ground so that [[Canterbury Cathedral]] was visible in the background. The painting has Blythe in the action of bowling from the Pavilion End to [[Johnny Tyldesley]]. Tayler compressed the view of the playing area so that he could make the players both recognizable and a reasonable size, and also feature all of Kent's eleven players.<ref name=ct />
