"'''Flight'''" is the twenty-fourth and final episode of the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 8)|eighth season]] of the American television [[medical drama]] ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', and the show's 172nd episode overall. It was written by series creator [[Shonda Rhimes]], and directed by [[Rob Corn]]. The episode was originally broadcast on the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) in the United States on May 17, 2012. In the episode, six doctors from Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital who are victims of an [[aviation accident]] fight to stay alive, but [[Lexie Grey|Dr. Lexie Grey]] ([[Chyler Leigh]]) ultimately dies. Other storylines occur in [[Seattle]] where [[Richard Webber|Dr. Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens, Jr.]]) plans his annual dinner for the departing [[Residency (medicine)|residents]], [[Owen Hunt|Dr. Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]) fires [[Teddy Altman|Dr. Teddy Altman]] ([[Kim Raver]]), and [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]) get engaged. 

The episode marked Leigh's and Raver's final appearance to the series. Exterior filming of the accident took place at [[Big Bear Lake, California|Big Bear Lake]], [[California]]. [[Jason George]] reprised his role as a guest star, whereas [[James LeGros]] made his first appearance. The episode opened to mixed reviews from television critics, with some criticizing the death of Lexie, but praising Leigh's performance, in addition to [[Ellen Pompeo]] ([[Meredith Grey|Dr. Meredith Grey]])'s and [[Eric Dane]] ([[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Dr. Mark Sloan]])'s. "Flight" was also nominated under several categories of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'s}} finale awards. Upon its initial airing, the episode was viewed by 11.44&nbsp;million Americans, garnered a 4.1/11 [[Nielsen ratings#Ratings/share and total viewers|Nielsen rating/share]] in the 18<U+2013>49 demographic, ranking fourth for the night in terms of viewership, and registering as Thursday's highest-rated drama.

==Plot==
After their plane crashes in the woods, [[Meredith Grey|Dr. Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), [[Lexie Grey|Dr. Lexie Grey]] ([[Chyler Leigh]]), [[Cristina Yang|Dr. Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]), [[Arizona Robbins|Dr. Arizona Robbins]] ([[Jessica Capshaw]]), [[Derek Shepherd|Dr. Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), and [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Dr. Mark Sloan]] ([[Eric Dane]]) desperately fight to stay alive. Meredith is relatively unscathed, while the rest have serious injuries: the pilot, Jerry ([[James LeGros]]), has a major spine injury, and Yang dislocates her arm. Robbins' leg bone is broken and sticking through the skin, Sloan has serious internal injuries; though initially adrenaline keeps him on his feet. Shepherd is sucked out the side of the plane and awakens alone in the wood; his mangled hand having been pushed through the door of the plane. However, none are in as bad shape as Lexie, who is crushed under a piece of the plane. While Meredith searches for Shepherd, Yang and Sloan try to move the debris off Lexie. Eventually, the two realize that they cannot save her, so Sloan holds her hand while she dies, telling her that he loves her. As Sloan tells her of the life the two were meant to have together, Lexie dies with a smile on her face just as Meredith and Yang are approaching. 

Lexie's death devastates Meredith, who is still desperately trying to find her husband. Eventually, she and Shepherd reunite and they fix his hand as best as they can. Meanwhile, back at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, no one is aware of what has happened to the other doctors. [[Richard Webber|Dr. Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens, Jr.]]) prepares the annual dinner for the departing [[Residency (medicine)|residents]], which [[Alex Karev|Dr. Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]), [[Jackson Avery|Dr. Jackson Avery]] ([[Jesse Williams (actor)|Jesse Williams]]), and [[April Kepner|Dr. April Kepner]] ([[Sarah Drew]]) are dreading. Avery makes the choice to take a job offer at [[Tulane Medical Center]], and he and Kepner share a moment. Dr. Ben Warren ([[Jason George]]) and [[Dr. Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]) decide to get married, even though Warren is going to start his surgical internship in [[Los Angeles]]. After realizing [[Teddy Altman|Dr. Teddy Altman]] ([[Kim Raver]]) was offered a chief position at [[United States Army Medical Command]] (MEDCOM) and is refusing to leave [[Seattle]] out of loyalty, [[Owen Hunt|Dr. Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]), the chief of surgery, fires her to free her from the hospital where her husband died. As the episode ends, Hunt picks up his messages to discover the surgical team never made it to [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]]. The residents, finally excited to celebrate at Webber's dinner, are left waiting for their stranded friends. The remaining crash survivors are left struggling to stay awake as their last match goes out. In the closing monologue, Meredith repeats the opening to the speech that Webber gave in the [[A Hard Day's Night (Grey's Anatomy)|pilot episode]] of the series.

The physicality for Cristina, she had to do a lot of things with one arm, and I had to do a lot of things with one shoe. You're running around the mountain with one shoe and one arm basically and doing things that way. And it's like we've had this cushy time on stages and in the hospital. But being out in the open on the side of a mountain was exhilarating; you cannot beat location work. I've done very little greenscreen work, but it's just a pooper.

In regard to the episode, Rhimes commented before it originally aired that it was difficult to write, largely because of the death of a main character.

Speaking of Raver's departure whose character left Seattle Grace for MEDCOM, Rhimes elaborated that Raver was offered a contract renewal, but declined.<ref name="digital1"/>

''[[Poptimal]]''{{'s}} Tanya Lane wrote, "Wow<U+2026>just wow. ''Grey's Anatomy'' has once again managed to shock with its season finale." While she appreciated the "realism and authenticity that ''Grey's'' is known for", she found the episode was "almost too much" as it was "extremely gory and difficult to watch, initially because of the grisly wounds" but later because of the "heavy and emotional things that transpired". She thought Pompeo gave one of her best performances when her character learned that her sister was dead.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lane|first=Tanya|title=Grey<U+2019>s Anatomy Season Finale Review: Tears and Gore Galore|url=http://poptimal.com/2012/05/greys-anatomy-season-finale-review-tears-and-gore-galore/#.T7u36flTadk|work=[[Poptimal]]|accessdate=May 22, 2012|date=May 21, 2012}}</ref> ''[[Digital Spy]]''{{'s}} Ben Lee found Leigh's and Dane's performances "phenomenal" and added that he had probably never seen a better performance from Dane. He described the moment the two actors shared as "truly poignant". To him, Lexie's death felt like a finale, which was thus too early. As for what was happening in Seattle Grace, he thought it was "a bit pointless" and "uninteresting" except Altman's departure, which he deemed "the most significant moment at the hospital".<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Ben|title='Grey's Anatomy' recap: Major death in season finale 'Flight'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/s46/greys-anatomy/recaps/a382356/greys-anatomy-recap-major-death-in-season-finale-flight.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Nat Mags]]|accessdate=May 22, 2012|date=May 18, 2012}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'s}} Tanner Stransky commented of Lexie's death: "It was an intense death.

Could it have been someone less important somehow? I guess it would have been too obvious to do Kepner. And you probably just don't kill off a hottie like Mark Sloan, right?" Stransky also complained about Robbins' screams at the beginning of the episode, but enjoyed Bailey's story.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stransky|first=Tanner|title='Grey's Anatomy' season finale recap: A Grey Goes Down|url=http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/greys-anatomy-season-8-episode-24/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|accessdate=May 22, 2012|date=May 18, 2012}}</ref>
