{{History of Portugal}}
The '''Portuguese Empire''' ({{lang-pt|Imp<U+00E9>rio Portugu<U+00EA>s}}), also known as the '''Portuguese Overseas Empire''' (''Ultramar Portugu<U+00EA>s'') or the '''Portuguese Colonial Empire''' (''Imp<U+00E9>rio Colonial Portugu<U+00EA>s''), was the first [[global empire]] in history.<ref>Melvin Eugene Page, Penny M. Sonnenburg, p. 481</ref><ref>Liam Matthew Brockey, p. xv</ref><ref>Richard M. Juang, Noelle Anne Morrissette, p. 894</ref> In addition, it was the longest-lived of the modern [[Europe]]an [[Colonialism|colonial]] empires, spanning almost six centuries, from the capture of [[Ceuta]] in 1415 to the handover of [[Macau]] in 1999 or the grant of sovereignty to [[East Timor]] in 2002. The empire spread  throughout a vast number of territories that are now part of [[Evolution_of_the_Portuguese_Empire#Countries with territories part of the Portuguese Empire|53 different sovereign states]].

Portuguese sailors began exploring the coast of [[Africa]] in 1419, using recent developments in [[navigation]], [[cartography]] and maritime technology such as the [[caravel]], in order that they might find a sea route to the source of the lucrative [[spice trade]]. In 1488, [[Bartolomeu Dias]] rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]], and in 1498, [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India. In 1500, either by an accidental landfall or by the crown's secret design, [[Pedro <U+00C1>lvares Cabral]] discovered [[Brazil]] on the [[South America]]n coast. Over the following decades, Portuguese sailors continued to explore the coasts and islands of East Asia, establishing [[Portuguese Forts|forts]] and [[Factory (trading post)#Portuguese Feitorias (c.1445)|factories]] as they went. By 1571, a string of outposts connected [[Lisbon]] to [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] along the coasts of [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], [[India]], and [[Asia]]. This commercial network brought [[Economic history of Portugal|great wealth]] to [[Portugal]].

Between 1580 and 1640 Portugal became the junior partner to Spain in the [[Iberian Union|union]] of the two countries' crowns. Though the empires continued to be administered separately, Portuguese colonies became the subject of attacks by three rival European powers hostile to Spain and envious of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] successes overseas: [[Dutch Empire|the Netherlands]], [[British Empire|Britain]] and [[French colonial empire|France]]. With its smaller population, Portugal was unable to effectively defend its overstretched network of trading posts, and the empire began a long and gradual decline.<ref name="Paz1997">{{citation|last=leep|first=|title=Structural dynamics: theory and computation|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=njRlswNf92wC|accessdate=12 August 2011|year=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-412-07461-5}}</ref>

Significant losses to the Dutch in [[Portuguese India]] and [[Southeast Asia]] during the 17th century brought an end to the Portuguese trade monopoly in the Indian Ocean.  Brazil became Portugal's most valuable colony until, as part of the wave of [[Decolonization of the Americas|independence movements]] that swept the [[Americas]] during the early 19th century, it broke away in 1822. Portugal's Empire was reduced to its colonies on the African coastline (which were expanded inland during the [[Scramble for Africa]] in the late 19th century), [[East Timor]], and enclaves in India and Macau.

After [[World War II]], Portugal's leader, [[Ant<U+00F3>nio de Oliveira Salazar|Ant<U+00F3>nio Salazar]], attempted to keep what remained of the pluricontinental Empire intact at a time when other European countries were beginning to withdraw from their colonies. In 1961 the handful of Portuguese troops garrisoned in [[Goa]] were unable to prevent [[India]]n troops marching into the colony. Salazar began a long and bloody [[Portuguese Colonial War|war]] to quell anti-colonialist forces in the African colonies. The unpopular war lasted until the [[Carnation Revolution|overthrow of the regime in 1974]]. The new government immediately changed policy and recognised the independence of all its colonies, except for [[Macau]], which by agreement with the Chinese government was returned to China in 1999, thereby marking the end of the Portuguese Empire.  Currently, the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]] archipelagos are the only territories overseas that remain politically linked to Portugal.

The [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP) is the cultural successor of the Empire.

{{main|History of Portugal}}
[[Image:Portugal and Environs 1415.png|thumb|left|235px|[[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] in 1415.]]
The origins of the Portuguese Empire, and of Portugal itself, lay in the ''[[reconquista]]'': the gradual [[Christian]] reconquest of the Iberian peninsula from the [[Moors]]. After establishing itself as a separate [[Kingdom of Portugal|kingdom]] in 1139, Portugal completed its reconquest of Moorish territory by reaching [[Algarve]] in 1249, but its independence continued to be threatened by neighbouring [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] until the signing of the [[Treaty of Ayll<U+00F3>n]] in 1411.

Free from threats to its existence and unchallenged by the wars fought by other European states, Portuguese attention turned overseas and towards a military expedition to the [[Muslim]] lands of North Africa.<ref name="Newitt, p. 19">[[#refNewitt|Newitt]], p.&nbsp;19</ref> There were several probable motives for their first attack, on the [[Marinid Dynasty|Marinid Sultanate]] (in present-day [[Morocco]]): it offered the opportunity to continue the Christian [[crusade]] against [[Islam]]; to the military class, it promised glory on the battlefield and the spoils of war;<ref name="ReferenceB">[[#refBoxer1969|Boxer]], p.&nbsp;19</ref> and finally, it was also a chance to expand Portuguese trade and to address Portugal's economic decline.<ref name="Newitt, p. 19"/>

In 1415 an attack was made on [[Ceuta]], a strategically located North African Muslim enclave along the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and one of the terminal ports of the trans-Saharan gold and slave trades. The [[Battle of Ceuta|conquest]] was a military success, and marked one of the first steps in Portuguese expansion beyond the Iberian Peninsula,<ref>[[#refAbernethy|Abernethy]], p.&nbsp;4</ref> but it proved costly to defend against the Muslim forces that soon besieged it. The Portuguese were unable to use it as a base for further expansion into the hinterland,<ref>[[#refNewitt|Newitt]], p.&nbsp;21</ref> and the trans-Saharan caravans merely shifted their routes to bypass Ceuta and/or used alternative Muslim ports.<ref name="Diffie, p. 55">[[#refDiffie|Diffie]], p.&nbsp;55</ref>

Although Ceuta proved to be a disappointment for the Portuguese, the decision was taken to hold it while exploring along the Atlantic African coast.<ref name="Diffie, p. 55"/> A key supporter of this policy was [[Infante]] [[Dom (title)|Dom]] [[Henry the Navigator]], who had been involved in the [[Battle of Ceuta|capture of Ceuta]], and who took the lead role in promoting and financing Portuguese maritime exploration until his death in 1460.<ref>Henry, a product of 15th century Portugal, was inspired by both religious and economic factors. [[#refDiffie|Diffie]], p.&nbsp;56</ref> At the time, Europeans did not know what lay beyond [[Cape Bojador]] on the African coast. Henry wished to know how far the Muslim territories in Africa extended, and whether it was possible to reach Asia by sea, both to reach the source of the lucrative [[spice trade]] and perhaps to join forces with the fabled Christian kingdom of [[Prester John]] that was rumoured to exist somewhere in the "Indies".<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref>[[#refAnderson|Anderson]], p.&nbsp;50</ref> Under his sponsorship, soon the Atlantic islands of [[Madeira]] (1420) and [[Azores]] (1427) were reached and started to be settled producing [[wheat]] to export to Portugal.

Fears of what lay beyond [[Cape Bojador]], and whether it was possible to return once it was passed, were assuaged in 1434 when it was rounded by one of Infante Henry's captains, [[Gil Eanes]]. Once this psychological barrier had been crossed, it became easier to probe further along the coast.<ref>[[#refDiffie|Diffie]], p.&nbsp;68</ref>
In 1443 [[Infante Pedro, Duke of Coimbra|Infante Dom Pedro]], Henry's brother, granted him the monopoly of navigation, war and trade in the lands south of Cape Bojador. Later this monopoly would be enforced by the [[Papal bull]]s [[Dum Diversas]] (1452) and [[Romanus Pontifex]] (1455), granting Portugal the trade monopoly for the newly discovered lands.<ref>[[#refDaus|Daus]], p.&nbsp;33</ref> A major advance which accelerated this project was the introduction of the [[caravel]] in the mid-15th century, a ship that could be sailed closer to the wind than any other in operation in Europe at the time.<ref>[[#refBoxer1969|Boxer]], p.&nbsp;29</ref> Using this new maritime technology, Portuguese navigators reached ever more southerly [[latitude]]s, advancing at an average rate of one degree a year.<ref>[[#refRussellWood|Russell-Wood]], p.&nbsp;9</ref> [[Senegal]] and [[Cape Verde Peninsula]] were reached in 1445.
[[File:Amina.jpg|thumb|left|A 16th century map of the western Africa showing Portuguese claims: "Guine" ([[Guinea (region)|Guinea]]) and "Amina," (the Mina Coast along the [[Gulf of Guinea]]).]]

The first [[feitoria]] trade post overseas was established in 1445 on the island of [[Arguin]] off the coast of Mauritania, to attract Muslim traders and monopolize the business in the routes traveled in North Africa. In 1446, [[Ant<U+00F3>nio Fernandes]] pushed on almost as far as present-day [[Sierra Leone]] and the [[Gulf of Guinea]] was reached in the 1460s.

Expansion of [[sugarcane]] in Madeira started in 1455, using advisers from [[Sicily]] and (largely) [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] capital to produce the ''"sweet salt"'' [[History of sugar|rare in Europe]]. Already cultivated in [[Algarve]], the accessibility of Madeira attracted Genoese and Flemish traders keen to bypass Venetian monopolies. Slaves were used, and the proportion of imported slaves in Madeira reached 10% of the total population by the 16th century.<ref>Godinho, V. M.

The success of sugar merchants such as [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] would propel the investment in future travels.

In 1469, after prince Henry's death and as a result of meager returns of the African explorations, King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]] granted the monopoly of trade in part of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] to merchant [[Fern<U+00E3>o Gomes]]. Gomes, who had to explore {{convert|100|mi|km}} of the coast each year for five years, discovered the islands of the Gulf of Guinea, including [[S<U+00E3>o Tom<U+00E9> and Pr<U+00ED>ncipe]] and found a thriving [[alluvial]] gold trade among the natives and visiting Arab and Berber traders at the port then named [[Elmina|Mina]] (the mine), where he established a trading post. Trade between Elmina and Portugal grew throughout a decade. In 1481, the recently-crowned [[John II of Portugal|Jo<U+00E3>o II]] decided to build [[S<U+00E3>o Jorge da Mina]] in order to ensure the protection of this trade, which was held again as a royal monopoly. The [[Equator]] was crossed by navigators sponsored by Fern<U+00E3>o Gomes in 1473 and the [[Congo River]] by [[Diogo C<U+00E3>o]] in 1482. In 1486, C<U+00E3>o continued to [[Cape Cross]], in present-day [[Namibia]], near the [[Tropic of Capricorn]].

[[File:Caopillar.JPG#file|thumb|upright|Illustration of the pillar Diogo C<U+00E3>o erected at Cape St. Mary, in what is today Angola.]]In 1488, [[Bartolomeu Dias]] rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on the southern tip of Africa, proving false the view that had existed since [[Ptolemy]] that the [[Indian Ocean]] was [[land-locked]]. Simultaneously [[P<U+00EA>ro da Covilh<U+00E3>]], traveling secretly overland, had reached [[Ethiopia]], suggesting that a sea route to the Indies would soon be forthcoming.<ref>[[#refAnderson|Anderson]], p.&nbsp;59</ref>

As the Portuguese explored the coastlines of Africa, they left behind a series of [[Padr<U+00E3>o|padr<U+00F5>es]], stone crosses engraved with the Portuguese coat of arms marking their claims,<ref>[[#refNewitt|Newitt]], p.&nbsp;47</ref> and built forts and trading posts. From these bases, they engaged profitably in the slave and gold trades. Portugal enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the African seaborne slave trade for over a century, importing around 800 slaves annually. Most were brought to the Portuguese capital [[Lisbon]], where it is estimated black Africans came to constitute 10 per cent of the population.<ref>[[#refAnderson|Anderson]], p.&nbsp;55</ref>

===Tordesillas division of the world (1492)===
[[Image:Spain and Portugal.png|thumb|left|The 1494 [[Tordesilhas Treaty]] [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] dividing the world between  Portugal and Castille/Spain (purple) and the [[Moluccas]] [[antimeridian]] (green), set at the [[Treaty of Zaragoza]], 1529.]]
In 1492 [[Christopher Columbus]]'s discovery for [[Spain]] of the [[New World]], which he believed to be Asia, led to disputes between the Spanish and Portuguese. These were eventually settled by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494, which divided the world outside of Europe in an exclusive [[duopoly]] between the Portuguese and the Spanish along a north-south meridian 370 [[League (unit)|leagues]], or {{convert|970|mi|km|-1}}, west of the Cape Verde islands. However, as it was not possible at the time to correctly measure [[longitude]], the exact boundary was disputed by the two countries until 1777.<ref>[[#refDiffie|Diffie]], p.&nbsp;174</ref>

The completion of these negotiations with Spain is one of several reasons proposed by historians for why it took nine years for the Portuguese to follow up on Dias's voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, though it has also been speculated that other voyages were in fact taking place in secret during this time.<ref>[[#refDiffie|Diffie]], p.&nbsp;176</ref><ref>[[#refBoxer|Boxer]], p.&nbsp;36</ref> Whether or not this was the case, the long-standing Portuguese goal of finding a sea route to Asia was finally achieved in a ground-breaking voyage commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]].

===Portuguese enter the Indian Ocean (1497<U+2013>1542)===

{{Main|Portuguese India Armadas}}
[[File:Vascodagama.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Vasco da Gama]] lands at [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]], May 20, 1498.]]
The squadron of [[Vasco da Gama]] left Portugal in 1497, rounded the Cape and continued along the coast of East Africa, where a local pilot was brought on board who guided them across the [[Indian Ocean]], reaching [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (the capital of the native kingdom ruled by [[Zamorin]]s) in south-western [[India]] in May 1498.<ref>[[#refScammell|Scammell]], p.&nbsp;13</ref> The second voyage to India was dispatched in 1500 under [[Pedro <U+00C1>lvares Cabral]]. While following the same south-westerly route as Gama across the Atlantic Ocean, Cabral made landfall on the Brazilian coast. This was probably an accidental discovery, but it has been speculated that the Portuguese secretly knew of Brazil's existence and that it lay on their side of the Tordesillas line.<ref>[[#refMcAlister|McAlister]], p.&nbsp;75</ref> Cabral recommended to the Portuguese King that the land be settled, and two follow up voyages were sent in 1501 and 1503. The land was found to be abundant in ''pau-brasil'', or [[brazilwood]], from which it later inherited its name, but the failure to find gold or silver meant that for the time being Portuguese efforts were concentrated on India.<ref>[[#refMcAlister|McAlister]], p.&nbsp;76</ref>

Profiting from the rivalry between the [[Cochin kingdom|ruler of Kochi]] and the [[Zamorin]] of [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]], the Portuguese were well received and seen as allies, getting a permit to build a [[Fort Kochi|fort (Fort Manuel]]) and a trading post that were the first European settlement in India.  In 1505 King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] appointed [[Francisco de Almeida]] first [[Viceroy]] of Portuguese India, establishing the Portuguese government in the east. That year the Portuguese conquered [[Kannur]] where they founded [[St. Angelo Fort]]. [[Louren<U+00E7>o de Almeida]] arrived in [[Ceylon]] (modern Sri Lanka), where he discovered the source of [[cinnamon]].

In 1506 a Portuguese fleet under the command of [[Trist<U+00E3>o da Cunha]] and [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], conquered [[Socotra]] at the entrance of the [[Red Sea]] and [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] in 1507, having failed to conquer [[Ormuz]], following a strategy intended to close the entrances to the Indian Ocean. That same year were built fortresses in the [[Island of Mozambique]] and [[Mombasa]] on the Kenyan coast. [[Madagascar]] was partly explored by [[Trist<U+00E3>o da Cunha]] and in the same year [[Mauritius]] was discovered.

In 1509, the Portuguese won the sea [[Battle of Diu (1509)|Battle of Diu]] against the combined forces of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Beyazid II]], [[Gujarat Sultanate|Sultan of Gujarat]], [[Mamluk|Maml<U+00FB>k Sultan of Cairo]], [[Zamorin]] of [[Kozhikode]], [[Venetian Republic]], and [[Ragusan Republic]] (Dubrovnik). The Portuguese victory was critical for its strategy of control of the Indian Sea: Turks and Egyptians withdrew their navies from India, leaving the seas to the Portuguese, setting its trade dominance for almost a century, and greatly assisting the growth of the Portuguese Empire. It also marked the beginning of the European colonial dominance in Asia. A [[Siege of Diu|second Battle of Diu]] in 1538 finally ended Ottoman ambitions in India and confirmed Portuguese hegemony in the Indian Ocean.
[[File:Diu1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Diu, India|Diu]] fortress in [[Portuguese India]].]]

Under the government of Albuquerque, [[Goa]] was taken from the [[Adil Shahi dynasty|Bijapur sultanate]] in 1510 with the help of Hindu [[privateer]] [[Timoji]]. Coveted for being the best port in the region, mainly for the commerce of Arabian horses for the [[Deccan sultanates]], it allowed to move on from the guest stay in Kochi. Despite constant attacks, it became the headquarters of the Portuguese state in India, with its conquest triggering compliance of neighbor kingdoms: [[Gujarat]] and [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]] sent embassies, offering alliances and grants to fortify. Albuquerque began that year in Goa the first Portuguese [[Mint (coin)|mint]] in India, taking the opportunity to announce the achievement.<ref>[[#refDeSouza|DeSouza]], p.&nbsp;220</ref>

Initially king Manuel I and his council in Lisbon had tried to distribute power in the Indian Ocean, creating three areas of jurisdiction: Albuquerque was sent to the Red Sea, [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]] to Southeast Asia, seeking an agreement with the Sultan of Malacca, and Jorge de Aguiar followed by Duarte de Lemos were sent to the area between the Cape of Good Hope and Gujarat.<ref>[[#refDiffie|Diffie]], p.&nbsp;245<U+2013>247</ref> However, such posts were centralized by Afonso de Albuquerque and remained so in subsequent ruling.

In 1505, Portuguese traders reached [[Ceylon]]; their initial forays were against [[Kotte Kingdom|Kotte]], which enjoyed a lucrative [[monopoly]] on the [[spice trade]], which was also of interest to the Portuguese.<ref name=TA2/> Although [[Sankili Segarajasekaran|Cankili I]] of [[Jaffna]] initially resisted contact with them, the [[Jaffna kingdom]] came to the attention of Portuguese officials soon after for their resistance to missionary activities as well as logistical reasons due to its proximity with [[Trincomalee]] harbour among other reasons.<ref name=TA2>Abeysinghe, T. ''Jaffna Under the Portuguese'', p.  2</ref>  In April 1511 Albuquerque sailed to [[Malacca]] in Malaysia,<ref>Ricklefs, M.C. (1991). A History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1300, 2nd Edition.

The peninsula of Malacca became then the strategic base for Portuguese trade expansion with China and Southeast Asia, under the Portuguese rule  with its capital at Goa. To defend the city was erected a strong gate which, called the "A Famosa", still remains. Knowing of Siamese ambitions over Malacca, Albuquerque sent immediately [[Duarte Fernandes]] on a diplomatic mission to the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|kingdom of Siam]] (modern Thailand), where he was the first European to arrive, establishing amicable relations between both kingdoms.<ref>Donald Frederick Lach, Edwin J. Van Kley, "Asia in the making of Europe", p. 520<U+2013>521, University of Chicago Press, 1994, ISBN 978-0-226-46731-3</ref> In November that year, getting to know the location of the so-called "[[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]" in the Moluccas, he sent an expedition led by [[Ant<U+00F3>nio de Abreu]] to find them, arriving in early 1512. Abreu went by Ambon while deputy commander [[Francisco Serr<U+00E3>o]] came forward to [[Ternate]], where a Portuguese fort was allowed. That same year, in Indonesia, the Portuguese took [[Makassar]], reaching [[Timor]] in 1514. Departing from Malacca, [[Jorge <U+00C1>lvares]] came to southern [[China]] in 1513. This visit was followed the arrival in [[Guangzhou]]. From 1516 on Portuguese traders established in [[Shangchuan Island]], until in 1557 the Ming court gave consent for a permanent official Portuguese trade base at [[Macau]].

The Portuguese empire expanded into the Persian Gulf as Portugal contested control of the spice trade with the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1515, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered the [[Huwala]] state of [[Ormus|Hormuz]] at the head of the Persian Gulf, establishing it as a vassal state. [[Aden]], however, resisted Albuquerque's expedition in that same year, and another attempt by Albuquerque's successor [[Lopo Soares de Albergaria]] in 1516, before capturing [[Bahrain]] in 1521, when a force led by [[Antonio Correia]] defeated the [[Jabrid]] King, [[Muqrin ibn Zamil]].<ref>Juan Cole, Sacred Space and Holy War, IB Tauris, 2007 p 37</ref> In a shifting series of alliances, the Portuguese dominated much of the southern Persian Gulf for the next hundred years. With the regular maritime route linking Lisbon to Goa since 1497, the island of [[Mozambique]] become a strategic port, and there was built [[Fort S<U+00E3>o Sebasti<U+00E3>o]] and an hospital. In the Azores, the Islands Armada protected the ships en route to Lisbon

In 1525, after [[Fern<U+00E3>o de Magalh<U+00E3>es]]'s expedition (1519<U+2013>1522), Spain under Charles V sent an expedition to colonize the [[Moluccas islands]], claiming that they were in his zone of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], since there was not a set limit to the east. [[Garc<U+00ED>a Jofre de Loa<U+00ED>sa]] expedition reached the Moluccas, docking at [[Tidore]]. The conflict with the Portuguese already established in nearby Ternate was inevitable, starting nearly a decade of skirmishes. An agreement was reached only with the [[Treaty of Zaragoza (1529)]], attributing the Moluccas to Portugal and the [[Philippines]] to Spain.
 
In 1534 Gujarat was occupied by the [[Mughals]] and the Sultan [[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat]] was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Bassein (1534)]] with the Portuguese, establishing an alliance to regain the country, giving in exchange [[Daman, Daman and Diu|Daman]], [[Diu, India|Diu]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Vasai|Bassein]].<ref>{{cite book| first=Sarina |last=Singh |title= India|publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2003 |isbn=1-74059-421-5 |ref=refDeSouza|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eqM-VSjw0gAC&pg=PA726&dq=%22Bahadur+Shah+of+Gujarat%22&ei=EEbTRpq6JKLY7AL_n4By&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html&sig=Ne24xZxzNNcZo1FrMyX-z4-59AU}}</ref> In 1538 the fortress of Diu is again surrounded by Ottoman ships.

In 1557 the Chinese authorities allowed the Portuguese to settle in [[Macau]] through an annual payment, creating a warehouse in the triangular trade between China, Japan and Europe. In 1570 the Portuguese bought a Japanese port where they founded the city of [[Nagasaki]],<ref>Yosabur<U+014D> Takekoshi, "The Economic Aspects of the History of the Civilization of Japan", ISBN 0-415-32379-7.</ref> thus creating a trading center for many years was the port from Japan to the world. A first expedition, led by Viceroy Dom [[Constantino de Bragan<U+00E7>a]] in 1560, failed to subdue Jaffna, but captured [[Mannar Island]].<ref name=a3>Abeysinghe, T. ''Jaffna Under the Portuguese'', p. 3</ref>  By June 1619, despite sharp resistance from [[Cankili II]] of Jaffna, there were two Portuguese expeditions; a naval expedition that was repulsed by the Malabari corsairs and another expedition by [[Phillippe de Oliveira]] and his land army of 5000, which defeated Cankili and conquered Jaffna, strengthening Portuguese control of shipping routes through the [[Palk Strait]].<ref>Kunarasa, K ''The Jaffna Dynasty'', p.  115</ref>

Portugal established trading ports at far-flung locations like [[Goa]], [[Ormuz]], [[Malacca]], [[Kochi, India|Kochi]], the [[Maluku Islands]], [[Macau]], and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. Guarding its trade from both European and Asian competitors, Portugal dominated not only the trade between Asia and Europe, but also much of the trade between different regions of Asia, such as [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[China]], and [[Japan]]. [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries, such as the Basque [[Francis Xavier]], followed the Portuguese to spread [[Roman Catholic]] [[Christianity]] to Asia with mixed success.

==First efforts of colonization in Brazil==
[[File:Capitanias.jpg|thumb|left|Portuguese map (1574), showing the 15 hereditary [[Colonial Brazil|captaincies]] of Brazil.]]
In 1534, promoting settlement to overcome the need to defend the territory, [[John III of Portugal|John III]] organized the colonization of [[Brazil]] through land grants. As of 1520, the Portuguese had realized that Brazil was likely to be disputed, with [[Francis I of France]] challenging the Treaty of Tordesillas and supporting [[privateers]]. The increase in [[brazilwood]] smuggling pressed this effort to effective occupation of the territory, although since 1503 an expedition under the command of [[Gon<U+00E7>alo Coelho]] reported French raids on the Brazilian coasts and, in the same year, [[Martim Afonso de Sousa]] went to patrol the whole Brazilian coast, banish the French and create some of the first colonial towns: [[S<U+00E3>o Vicente, Brazil|S<U+00E3>o Vicente]] ( 1532 ) and [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (city)|S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] ( 1554 ).

Fifteen longitudinal tracks, ranging from the coast to the Tordesillas limit, were created. This vast lands were donated in form of hereditary [[Colonial Brazil#Captaincies|captaincies]] (Capitanias Heredit<U+00E1>rias) to grantees rich enough to support settlement, as had been done successfully in [[Madeira]] and [[Cape Verde]] islands.<ref>[[#refDiffie|Diffie]], p.  310</ref> Each [[captain-major]] should build settlements, grant allotments and administer justice, being responsible for developing and taking the costs of colonization, although not being the owner: he could transmit it to offspring, but not sell it. Twelve recipients came from Portuguese gentry who become prominent in Africa and India and senior officials of the court, such as [[Jo<U+00E3>o de Barros]] and [[Martim Afonso de Sousa]].

Of the fifteen original captaincies (a two-month trip from Portugal), only two, [[Pernambuco]] and S<U+00E3>o Vicente, prospered. Both dedicated to the crop of [[sugar cane]] and the settlers managed to maintain alliances with [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. The establishment of the [[sugar cane]] industry demanded intensive labor which would be met with native American and, later, African slaves.

Deeming the ''capitanias'' system ineffective, the king decided to centralize the government of the colony, in order to "give help and assistance" to grantees. In 1548 he created the first General Government, sending in [[Tom<U+00E9> de Sousa]] as first governor and rescuing the captaincy of the [[Bay of All Saints]], making it a royal captaincy, seat of the Government. This measure did not entailed the extinction of captaincies. Tom<U+00E9> de Sousa built the capital of Brazil, [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]] at the Bay of All Saints. The first [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] arrived the same year. From 1565 through 1567 [[Mem de S<U+00E1>]], a Portuguese colonial official and the third [[Governor General]] of Brazil, successfully destroyed a ten year-old [[French colonization of the Americas|French colony]] called [[France Antarctique]], at [[Guanabara Bay]]. He and his nephew, [[Est<U+00E1>cio de S<U+00E1>]], then founded the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]] in March 1567.

In 1580, King [[Philip II of Spain]] invaded Portugal after a [[1580 Portuguese succession crisis|crisis of succession]] brought about by King [[Sebastian of Portugal]]'s death during a disastrous [[Battle of Ksar El Kebir|Portuguese Ksar El Kebir attack]] on [[Morocco]] in 1578. At the Cortes of Tomar in 1581, Philip was crowned Philip I of Portugal, uniting the two crowns and overseas empires under [[Spanish Habsburgs|Spanish Habsburg]] rule in a [[Dynastic union|dynastic]] [[Iberian Union]]. At Tomar, Philip promised to keep the empires legally distinct, leaving the administration of the Portuguese Empire to Portuguese nationals, with a [[List of Viceroys of Portugal during the Iberian Union|Viceroy of Portugal]] in Lisbon seeing to his interests.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[#refBoyajian|Boyajian]], p.&nbsp;11</ref> All the Portuguese colonies accepted the new state of affairs except for the [[Azores]], which held out for [[Ant<U+00F3>nio, Prior of Crato|Ant<U+00F3>nio]], a Portuguese rival claimant to the throne who had garnered the support of [[Catherine de Medici]] of [[France]] in exchange for the promise to cede Brazil. Spanish forces eventually captured the island in 1583.<ref>[[#refAnderson|Anderson]], pp.&nbsp;104<U+2013>105</ref>

The union with Spain entailed both benefits and drawbacks as far as the Portuguese Empire was concerned. Spanish imperial trade networks were opened to Portuguese merchants, which was particularly lucrative for Portuguese slave traders who could now sell slaves in Spanish America at a higher price than could be fetched in Brazil.<ref>[[#refLockhart|Lockhart]], p.&nbsp;250</ref>

The Tordesillas boundary between Spanish and Portuguese control in South America was then increasingly ignored by the Portuguese, who pressed beyond it into the heart of Brazil,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> allowing to expand the territory to the west. Exploratory missions were carried out both ordered by the government, the "entradas" (entries), and by private initiative, the "bandeiras" (flags), by the "[[bandeirantes]]".<ref>[[#refBoxer|Boxer]], pp.&nbsp;386</ref> These expeditions lasted for years venturing into unmapped regions, initially to capture natives and force them into slavery, and later focusing on finding gold, silver and diamond mines.

However, the union meant that Spain dragged Portugal into its conflicts with [[England]], [[France]] and the [[Dutch Republic]], countries which were beginning to establish their own overseas empires.<ref>[[#refAnderson|Anderson]], p.&nbsp;105</ref> The primary threat came from the Dutch, who had been engaged in a [[Eighty Years War|struggle for independence]] against Spain since 1568. In 1581 the [[Seventeen Provinces]] gained independence from the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg rule]], leading Philip II to prohibit commerce with Dutch ships, including in Brazil where [[Dutch people|Dutch]] had invested large sums in financing sugar production.

In 1592, during the war with Spain, an English fleet captured a large Portuguese carrack off the Azores, the [[Madre de Deus]]. Loaded with 900 tons of merchandise from India and China, estimated at half a million [[Pound sterling|pounds]] (nearly half the size of English Treasury at the time).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newberry.org/smith/slidesets/ss06.html|title=Early Modern Ship-types, 1450<U+2013>1650|last=Smith |first=Roger |year=1986|publisher=The Newberry Library|accessdate=2009-05-08}}</ref> This foretaste of the riches of the East galvanized English interest in the region.<ref>[http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/pdf/361/36100506.pdf The Presence of the "Portugals" in Macau and Japan in Richard Hakluyt's ''Navigations'']", Rog<U+00E9>rio Miguel Puga, ''Bulletin of Portuguese/Japanese Studies'', vol. 5, December 2002, pp.  81<U+2013>116.</ref>
That same year, [[Cornelis de Houtman]] was sent by Dutch merchants to Lisbon, to gather as much information as he could about the Spice Islands. In 1595, merchant and explorer [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], having traveled widely in the Indian Ocean at the service of the Portuguese, published  a travel report in [[Amsterdam]], the "Reys-gheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten" ("Report of a journey through the navigations of the Portuguese in the East").<ref>Van Linschoten, Jan Huyghen. ''Voyage to Goa and Back, 1583<U+2013>1592, with His Account of the East Indies'' : From Linschoten's Discourse of Voyages, in 1598/Jan Huyghen Van Linschoten. Reprint. New Delhi, AES, 2004, xxiv, 126 p., $11. ISBN 81-206-1928-5.</ref> This included vast directions on how to navigate between Portugal and the East Indies and to Japan. Dutch and English interest fed on new information led to a movement of commercial expansion, and the foundation of the English [[East India Company]], in 1600, and [[Dutch East India Company]](VOC), in 1602,  allowing the entry in of [[chartered companies]] in the so-called East Indies.

The Dutch took their fight overseas, attacking Spanish and Portuguese colonies and shipping, allying in turn with rival local leaders, and dismantling the Portuguese trade monopoly in Asia. The Portuguese Empire, consisting primarily of exposed coastal settlements vulnerable to being picked off one by one, proved to be an easier target than the Spanish Empire.<ref>[[#refBoxer1969|Boxer1969]], p.&nbsp;109</ref>

The [[Dutch<U+2013>Portuguese War]] began with an attack on [[S<U+00E3>o Tom<U+00E9> and Pr<U+00ED>ncipe]] in 1597 and lasted until 1663. The war was waged by the [[Dutch East India Company]] (established in 1602) and its [[Dutch West India Company|West India]] counterpart (1621), commercial ventures whose aim was to take over the trade networks that the Portuguese had established in Asian spices, West African slaves and Brazilian sugar<ref>[[#refBoxer1969|Boxer1969]], p.&nbsp;110</ref> In Asia, the Dutch captured the Spice Islands (1605), Malacca (1641), Colombo (1656), Ceylon (1658), Nagappattinam (1660), Cranganore and Cochin (1662).<ref>[[#refRussellWood|RussellWood]], p.&nbsp;24</ref> Although Goa, the capital of Portuguese Asia,

In need of slaves for the sugar producing regions they had captured in Brazil, the Dutch began attacks on the Portuguese trading posts on the west coast of Africa, successfully taking Elmina (1638), Luanda (1641) and Axim (1642).<ref>[[#refDavies|Davies]], p.&nbsp;124</ref> By 1654, Portugal had succeeded in expelling the Dutch from Brazil and Luanda, though its preeminent position in Asia had been lost forever.

===Imperial decline (1663<U+2013>1822)===
[[Image:OuroPreto1-CCBYSA.jpg|thumb|[[Ouro Preto]], 18th century colonial city in [[Minas Gerais]], Brazil.]]

The loss of colonies was one of the reasons that contributed to the end of the personal union with Spain. In 1640 John IV was proclaimed King of Portugal and the [[Portuguese Restoration War]] began. In 1661 the Portuguese offered [[Bombay]] and [[Tangier]] to England as part of a [[dowry]], and over the next hundred years the English gradually became the dominant trader in India, gradually excluding the trade of other powers. In 1668 Spain recognized the end of the [[Iberian Union]] and in exchange Portugal ceded [[Ceuta]] to the Spanish crown.

At the end of confrontations with the Dutch, Portugal was able to cling onto [[Goa]] and several minor bases in India, and managed to regain territories in [[Brazil]] and Africa, but lost forever to prominence in Asia as trade was diverted through increasing numbers of English, Dutch and French trading posts. Thus, throughout the century, Brazil gained increasing importance to the empire, which exported [[Brazilwood]] and [[sugar]].

From 1693 the focus was in a Brazilian region that become known as [[Minas Gerais]], where gold was discovered. Major discoveries of gold and, later, diamonds in Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso and Goias led to a  "[[Brazil Gold Rush|gold rush]]", with a large influx of migrants.<ref>[[#refBoxer|Boxer]], p.  168</ref> The village founded in 1696, became the new economic center of the empire, with rapid settlement and some conflicts. This gold cycle led to the creation of an internal market and attracted a large number of immigrants. The population grew 750% between 1650 to 1770 and quickly became the largest in Brazil, contributing to the settlement of the interior. 78% of this population being of black people and mestizos, and also [[New Christians]] from the north of Portugal and the Azores and Madeira, who settled as important trade agents in the villages around [[Ouro Preto]] and Mariana.

The gold rush considerably increased the revenue of the Portuguese crown, who charged a fifth of all the ore mined, or the "fifth". Diversion and smuggling were frequent, so a whole set of bureaucratic controls were instituted.  The gold production would have increased from 2 tonnes per year in 1701 to 14 tonnes in the 1750s but then began to decline sharply until exhausting before the end of the century. Gold surpassed the earnings of other products from the colonies and this trade brought prosperity to [[Rio de Janeiro]] and the kingdom.

In 1755 Lisbon suffered a catastrophic [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|earthquake]], which together with a subsequent [[tsunami]] killed more than 100,000 people out of a population of 275,000. This sharply checked Portuguese colonial ambitions in the late 18th century.

[[Image:Portuguese empire 1800.png|thumb|left|400px|Portuguese empire in 1822.]]

Unlike Spain, Portugal did not divide its [[Colonial Brazil|colonial territory in America]]. The [[capitania|captaincies]] created there were subordinated to a centralized administration in [[Salvador da Bahia|Salvador]] which reported directly to the Crown in Lisbon. The 18th century was marked by increasing centralization of royal power throughout the Portuguese empire, with the power of the [[Jesuits]], protective of the Indians against slavery, brutally suppressed by the [[Marquis of Pombal]], leading to the dissolution of this religious order under ground Portuguese in 1759. In 1774, the two states of Brazil and the Gr<U+00E3>o-Par<U+00E1> and Maranh<U+00E3>o merged into a single administrative entity.

The settlers began to express some dissatisfaction with the authorities in Lisbon as the decline of mining made it difficult to pay the taxes demanded by the Crown. In 1789, when it announced a tax of 20% of the gold removed, revolt broke out in Ouro Preto. Encouraged by the example of the [[United States of America]], which had won its independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] (1776<U+2013>1781), the attempt centred in the colonial province of [[Minas Gerais]] was made in 1789 to achieve the same objective.  However, the [[Inconfid<U+00EA>ncia Mineira]] failed, the leaders arrested and, of the participants of the insurrections the one of lowest social position, [[Tiradentes]], was hanged.

In 1808, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] invaded Portugal, and [[John VI of Portugal|Dom Jo<U+00E3>o]], [[Prince Regent]] in place of his mother, [[Maria I of Portugal|Dona Maria I]], ordered the transfer of the royal court to Brazil. In 1815 Brazil was elevated to the status of Kingdom, the Portuguese state officially becoming the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] (''Reino Unido de Portugal, Brasil e Algarves''), and the capital was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro, the only instance of a European country being ruled from one of its colonies. There was also the election of Brazilian representatives to the [[Cortes Constitucionais Portuguesas]] (Portuguese Constitutional Courts),  the Parliament that assembled in Lisbon in the wake of the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]].

Although the royal family returned to Portugal in 1821, the interlude led to a growing desire for independence amongst Brazilians. In 1822, the son of Dom Jo<U+00E3>o VI, then prince-regent [[Dom Pedro I]], proclaimed the independence of Brazil on September 7, 1822, and was crowned Emperor of the new [[Empire of Brazil]]. Unlike the Spanish colonies of South America, Brazil's independence was achieved without significant bloodshed.

==Consolidation in Africa (1822<U+2013>1951)== <!-- link to this section-heading from article 'Hermenegildo Capelo'-->
{{main|Portuguese East Africa|Portuguese West Africa|Portuguese Guinea}}
[[Image:Fort JesusMombasa.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Jesus]] is a 16th Century Portuguese Fortress in [[Mombasa, Kenya]]. It was declared in 2011 as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref name=imf2>http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1295</ref>]]
At the height of European colonialism in the 19th century, Portugal had lost its territory in [[South America]] and all but a few bases in Asia. During this phase, Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in Africa into nation-sized territories to compete with other European powers there. Portuguese territories eventually included the modern nations of [[Cape Verde]], [[S<U+00E3>o Tom<U+00E9> and Pr<U+00ED>ncipe]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Angola]], and [[Mozambique]].
[[Image:Mapa Cor-de-Rosa.svg|thumb|left|The [[Pink Map]] <U+2013> Portugal's claim of sovereignty over the land between [[Portuguese Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique]].]]
Portugal pressed into the hinterland of Angola and Mozambique, and explorers [[Alexandre de Serpa Pinto|Serpa Pinto]], [[Hermenegildo Capelo]] and [[Roberto Ivens]] were among the first Europeans to cross Africa west to east. The project to connect the two colonies, the [[Pink Map]], was the Portuguese main objective in the second half of the 19th century. However, the idea was unacceptable to the British, who had their own aspirations of contiguous British territory running from [[Cairo]] to [[Cape Town]]. The [[British Ultimatum]] of 1890 was imposed upon King [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and the Pink Map came to an end. The King's reaction to the ultimatum was exploited by republicans. In 1908 King Carlos and Prince [[Lu<U+00ED>s Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Lu<U+00ED>s Filipe]] were murdered in [[Lisbon]]. Lu<U+00ED>s Filipe's brother, Manuel, became King [[Manuel II of Portugal]]. Two years later Portugal became a [[republic]].

In [[World War I]] German troops threatened Mozambique, and Portugal entered the war to protect its colonies.

==Decolonization (1974<U+2013>1999)==
{{main|Portuguese Colonial War|Carnation Revolution|}}
[[Image:Portuguese Empire 20th century.png|thumb|300px|right|Portuguese colonies in the 20th century, dates represent loss of territory.]]

In the wake of [[World War II]], decolonization movements began to gain momentum in the empires of the European powers.  The ensuing [[Cold War]] also created instabilities among Portuguese overseas populations, as the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]] vied to increase their spheres of influence.  Following the granting of independence to [[India]] by [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1947, and the decision by France to allow its [[French India|enclaves in India]] to be incorporated into the newly independent nation, pressure was placed on Portugal to do the same.<ref>[[#refPearson|Pearson, p.&nbsp;158]]</ref> This was resisted by [[Ant<U+00F3>nio de Oliveira Salazar]], who had taken power in 1933.  Salazar rebuffed a request in 1950 by India's Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], to return the enclaves, viewing them as integral parts of Portugal.<ref>[[#refPearson|Pearson, p.&nbsp;160]]</ref> The following year, the Portuguese constitution was amended to change the status of the colonies to overseas provinces.  In 1954, a local uprising resulted in the overthrow of the Portuguese authorities in the Indian enclave of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]]. The existence of the remaining Portuguese colonies in India became increasingly untenable and Nehru enjoyed the support of almost all the Indian domestic political parties as well as the Soviet Union and its allies. In 1961, shortly after an uprising against the Portuguese in Angola, Nehru ordered the Indian Army in to [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]], which were quickly [[1961 Indian Annexation of Goa|captured]] and formally annexed the following year. Salazar refused to recognize the transfer of sovereignty, believing the territories to be merely occupied.  The Province of Goa continued to be represented in the Portuguese National Assembly until 1974.<ref name="ReferenceC">[[#refAnderson|Anderson]], p.&nbsp;153</ref>

The outbreak of violence in February 1961 in Angola was the beginning of the end of Portugal's empire in Africa.  Portuguese army officers in Angola held the view that it would be incapable of dealing militarily with an outbreak of guerilla warfare and therefore that negotiations should begin with the independence movements. However, Salazar publicly stated his determination to keep the empire intact, and by the end of the year, 50,000 troops had been stationed there.  The same year, the tiny Portuguese fort of S<U+00E3>o Jo<U+00E3>o Baptista de Ajud<U+00E1> in [[Ouidah]], a remnant of the West African [[slave trade]], was annexed by the new government of Dahomey (now [[Benin]]) that had gained its independence from France.  Unrest spread from Angola to Guinea, which rebelled in 1963, and Mozambique in 1964.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

The rise of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence among the [[Movimento das For<U+00E7>as Armadas]]'s military (MFA) and working class, and the cost and unpopularity of the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961<U+2013>1974), in which Portugal resisted to the emerging nationalist guerrilla movements in some of its African territories, eventually led to the collapse of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime in 1974. Known as the "[[Carnation Revolution]]", one of the first acts of the MFA-led government which then came into power <U+2013> the [[National Salvation Junta]] (''Junta de Salva<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Nacional'') <U+2013> was to end the wars and negotiate Portuguese withdrawal from its African colonies. These events prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from [[Overseas Province of Angola|Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]]), creating over a million Portuguese refugees <U+2013> the ''retornados.''<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], [[Time Magazine]] (Monday, July 7, 1975)</ref> Portugal's new ruling authorities also recognized Goa and other Portuguese India's territories [[Invasion of Goa|invaded by India's military forces]], as Indian territories. Benin's claims over [[S<U+00E3>o Jo<U+00E3>o Baptista de Ajud<U+00E1>]], were also accepted by the Portuguese, and diplomatic relations were restored with both India and Benin.

[[Image:Handover Ceremony of Macau Government.jpg|thumb|left|Handover Ceremony of Macau]]
Civil wars in both independent [[Mozambican Civil War|Mozambique]] and [[Angolan Civil War|Angola]] promptly broke out, with incoming communist governments formed by the former rebels (and backed by the [[Soviet Union]], [[Cuba]], and other communist countries) fighting against insurgent groups supported by nations like [[Zaire]], [[South Africa]], and the United States.

[[East Timor]] also declared independence at this time (1975), making an exodus of many Portuguese refugees to Portugal, also known as ''retornados.'' However, East Timor was almost immediately [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invaded by neighbouring Indonesia]], which occupied it until 1999. A United Nations-sponsored referendum that year resulted in East Timorese choosing independence, which was achieved in 2002.

The transfer of the sovereignty of [[Macau]] to [[China]] on December 20, 1999, under the terms of an agreement negotiated between [[People's Republic of China]] and Portugal twelve years earlier marked the end of the Portuguese overseas empire.  Nevertheless, the Portuguese language remains co-official with Chinese (Cantonese) in Macau.
