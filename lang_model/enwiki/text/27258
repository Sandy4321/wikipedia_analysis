The '''M3''' is an [[urban area|urban]] [[motorway]] 0.8&nbsp;miles (1.3&nbsp;km) in length owned by Siac Construction and Cintra, S.A. that connects the [[M2 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M2]] in north [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]] to the [[A2 road (Northern Ireland)|A2 Sydenham Bypass]] in east Belfast. It is the shortest motorway in Northern Ireland, and one of the busiest, carrying 60,000 vehicles per day as of 2005<ref name="nirs">[http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/roads/m3.html Northern Ireland Roads Site - M3]</ref>. Whilst classed as a motorway it has a permanent speed limit of 50 mph (80 km/h).

==History==
The M3 was originally planned in 1956 as the ''Eastern Approach'', named the M3 the following year, which would run from east Belfast to [[Bangor, Northern Ireland|Bangor]]. The plan was extended to include an orbital ''Belfast Urban Motorway'', close to the city centre, in 1964.<ref>[http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/roads/belfasturbanmotorway.html Northern Ireland Roads Site - Belfast Urban Motorway]</ref> However due to a combination of financial cutbacks and public opposition construction of the M3 never took place and the Belfast Urban Motorway was downgraded to the A12 [[Westlink Belfast|Westlink]] dual-carriageway and only partially completed.<ref>[http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/roads/westlink.html Northern Ireland Roads Site - Westlink]</ref> Traffic had to make do with crossing the [[River Lagan, Northern Ireland|River Lagan]] on the [[Queen's Bridge]] and using the A2 to Bangor.

However in 1987 the government announced a plan to build a new bridge across the Lagan connecting the M2 directly to the A2.<ref>[http://www.iht.org/motorway/m3ni.htm The Motorway Archive - M3 (Northern Ireland)]
</ref> It was built in two stages: the [[Lagan Bridge]] section connecting to the M2 opened on 22 January 1995 while the link to the A2 opened three years later in May 1998.<ref>[http://www.iht.org/motorway/m3nistat.htm The Motorway Archive - M3 (Northern Ireland) Dates Page]</ref> The route was designated as the M3, although it is not the same scheme as the one originally expected to be the M3.<ref name="nirsmh">[http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/roads/historymotorwayplans.html Northern Ireland Roads Site - History of Motorway Plans]</ref> Construction of this road was unusual as government policy was against the construction of new urban motorways.
