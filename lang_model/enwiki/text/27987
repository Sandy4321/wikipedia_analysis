[[Image:ETplazaAtbrenics.jpg|thumb|right|ICS buildings (center and left) viewed from the top of Bren Hall]]The '''Donald Bren School of [[Information and Computer Science]]s''', also known as the school of '''ICS''' or more formally as the '''Bren School''', is an academic unit of [[University of California, Irvine]] (UCI), and the only dedicated school of [[computer science]] in the [[University of California]] system. Consisting of over a thousand students and members, the school maintains three buildings in the South-East artery of UCI's undergraduate campus, and maintains student body and research affiliations throughout UCI.<ref name="about"/><ref name="enrollment"/>

ICS consists of three departments: Computer Science, [[Informatics]], and [[Statistics]]. The combined groupings focus the school around the fields of [[computing]] and processing of information. The departments confer four undergraduate, eleven masters, and seven doctoral degrees in total, with some degree programs cooperating with affiliated schools.<ref name="degrees"/>

== History ==

Beginning in 1968, three years after UCI's founding, the Department of Information and Computer Science was created as an independent department, not belonging to any school. In 2002, the 35 year old department was elevated to the status of a school, and its faculty were partitioned into two departments, the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Informatics. The Department of Statistics, founded earlier in 2002, was included as a third department in the newly created school.<ref name="about">Bren School, [http://www.ics.uci.edu/about/ About the school], 2006. URL accessed December 10, 2006.</ref>

During 2004, the school received a 20 million USD anonymous donation. The donation was later revealed to be from local realtor, [[Donald Bren]]. The school was renamed in his honor. The donation is primarily being used to seek out and seed prestigious researchers.<ref name="bren">Bren School, [http://www.ics.uci.edu/about/bren/ About the Bren gift], 2006. URL accessed December 10, 2006.</ref>

== Programs and majors ==

The school's independent status allows for unique majors and fields that are not bound by the rigorous requirements traditionally set forth by other schools, such as Engineering. The school of ICS is one of less than fifty independent computer science schools in the United States, and the only one in the University of California system.<ref name="about"/>

There are 893 undergraduate and 256 graduate students as of 2006, a drop from previous years. The Dean of ICS, Debra J. Richardson, speculates the drop is from fears of [[outsourcing]] and the [[dot-com bubble]] burst, both reputed factors in stagnating technology jobs. However, the percentage of female enrollment is 16.8%, an increase from previous years.<ref name="enrollment">UC Irvine, [http://www.oir.uci.edu/enrollments/ Headcounts by Academic Unit and Level], 2006. URL accessed December 10, 2006.</ref>

===Undergraduate===
The school possesses 4 undergraduate majors, ranging from lower level hardware to high level social computing, each providing a [[bachelor of science]] degree (notably, Computer Engineering is not part of ICS, and resides in the [[Henry Samueli School of Engineering]]). The school's primary major is ''Information and Computer Science'', focused on computer science theory and software engineering. In contrast to engineering majors, additional natural sciences (such as physics) are not required to complete the major. Two upper division theoretical mathematics courses are required, along with basic calculus, linear algebra, statistics, and discrete mathematics. The program allows students more freedom to pursue a selected field in computer science. Though not required for a degree, the school certifies specializations within the major:<ref name="degrees"/>
*Artificial Intelligence
*Computer Systems
*Implementation and Analysis of Algorithms
*Information Systems
*Networks and Distributed Systems
*Software Systems

The second most popular major within the school is ''Computer Science'', similar in composition to ICS. Though more limiting in electives, the major was formed around the recommended courses set by [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] and [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]], and features a more classical computer science curriculum.<ref name="degrees">Bren School, [http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/degrees/index.php?track=cs Undergraduate degrees], 21 August 2006. URL accessed December 10, 2006.</ref>

''Computer Science and Engineering'' requires more engineering preparation and courses than Information and Computer Science, including physics, electrical engineering, and multivariate calculus. Due to the nature of the program, it is hosted jointly with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.<ref name="cse major">UC Irvine, [http://www.editor.uci.edu/06-07/ics/ics.3.htm#gen2 Undergraduate Major in Computer Science and Engineering], 2006. URL accessed December 10, 2006.</ref>

The newest major is ''Informatics'', unique in the UC system, focusing on software engineering, social computing, and management.  The higher level of social abstraction prepares students in such fields as software analysis, management, design, and interfaces.<ref name="degrees"/>

=== Graduate ===
Committed to research as a University of California school, ICS provides 11 master's level and 7 doctorate level graduate programs. Since computing is a part of many other fields (which use or interact with computing technology), ICS collaborates with other schools in many of its programs.<ref name="grad">Bren School, [http://www.ics.uci.edu/grad/ Graduate Studies], ''Information on all the degrees offered by the school'', 20 October 2006. URL accessed December 14, 2006.</ref>

The Department of Computer Science offers a general major to those who have no specialized field, and is awarded as ''Information and Computer Science'' (M.S.). ''Computer Science'' (M.S.,Ph.D.) allows for a wide range of fields, similar to the general degree; however, doctoral degrees require a particular research interest within the field, unlike the general degree. ''[[Embedded Systems]]'' (M.S.) more narrowly focuses students on the implementation of specialized computer systems. ''Knowledge Discovery and Data'' (M.S.) applies to informatics fields like [[information processing]] and to computer science fields such as [[artificial intelligence]].<ref name="grad"/>

The Department of Informatics offers its own general degree ''Informatics Track in General Informatics'' (M.S.,Ph.D.), however doctoral candidates must have a specific research interest.
''Informatics Track in Interactive and Collaborative Technology'' (M.S.,Ph.D.) narrows its general degree to the field of [[human<U+2013>computer interaction]], with end parties as wholly human or man and machine. [[Software engineering]] is researched under the ''Informatics Track in Software'' (M.S.,Ph.D.) degree, as software development processes are directly related to human interaction and information systems.<ref name="grad"/>

Three multi-discipline fields exist, spread across more than one school. ''Networked Systems'' (M.S.,Ph.D.)  involves both the School of Engineering and the school of ICS. The research area covers high and low levels of telecommunications and computer networks. ''Arts Computation Engineering'' (M.S.), as its name suggests, covers both the School of Engineering and the [[Claire Trevor School of the Arts]] in addition to ICS. The field relies heavily on high level informatics principles, applying science to the arts. ''Informatics in Biology & Medicine'' (M.S.,Ph.D.), requires classes within the wide fields of Biology. Research may range from microscopic systems, such as proteins, or macro-level systems, such as populations.<ref name="grad"/>

Though the Department of Statistics currently has no undergraduate degrees, it offers one graduate program: ''Statistics'' (M.S.,Ph.D.). The graduate program may help model many different problems, and is highly applicable to researchers in other fields such as economics and biology.<ref name="grad"/>
