'''USS ''General Omar Bundy'' (AP-152)''' was a {{sclass|General G. O. Squier|transport ship}} for the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] in [[World War II]]. She was named in honor of [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] general [[Omar Bundy]]. She was transferred to the U.S. Army as '''USAT ''General Omar Bundy''''' in 1946. She was later sold for commercial operation under several names, before being declared missing and presumed sunk.<ref name=navsrc152 />

==Operational history==
''General Omar Bundy'' (AP-152) was launched [[5 August]] [[1944]] under a [[United States Maritime Commission|Maritime Commission]] contract (MC #704) by the Kaiser Co., [[Richmond, California]]; sponsored by Mrs. Lawrence of Richmond; acquired and simultaneously commissioned [[6 January]] [[1945]], Captain L. Wainwright in command.

''General Omar Bundy'' stood out of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] Bay [[10 March]] [[1945]] with 2,700 sailors and marines bound for the Southwest Pacific, and after delivering them to [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Ulithi]], and [[Guam]], returned to [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] [[11 May]] with over 1,700 homeward-bound troops after debarking 200 [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]ese POW's at Pearl Harbor on [[3 May]]. Six days later she sailed for the Atlantic via the [[Panama Canal]] and put in at [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[31 May]]. Underway again on [[9 June]], she touched [[Marseille]] to embark 2,800 troops for redeployment to the Pacific theater and brought them safely to [[Manila]] on [[6 August]] [[1945]] via [[Panama]]. She brought nearly 500 officers and men from Manila to [[Tacloban City|Tacloban]], [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]], [[Philippines|Philippine Islands]], and after embarking 1,500 veterans there, sailed via Ulithi and Guam to off-load her passengers at [[Seattle, Washington]], on [[4 September]]. Continuing her Magic Carpet duties, ''General Omar Bundy'' transported 3,000 replacement troops from Seattle to [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]] in late September and October, returning to [[Portland, Oregon]], on [[2 November]] [[1945]] with nearly 3,000 victorious soldiers. The ship returned to the [[Philippines]] in November to embark 3,300 returning veterans, and brought them home to San Francisco on [[19 December]] [[1945]].

In 1946 ''General Omar Bundy'' continued her "[[Operation Magic Carpet (World War II)|Magic-Carpet]]" and troop rotation duties, homeported at San Francisco and calling at Japan and Manila in February and at the Philippines again in April, returning to San Francisco after this last round-trip voyage and sailed from that port [[17 May]] [[1946]] bound for [[New York City|New York]] via the Panama Canal. She decommissioned [[14 June]] [[1946]] and was delivered to the Maritime Commission the next day. ''General Omar Bundy'' was struck from the Navy list on [[8 October]] [[1946]].

The transport was transferred to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] [[30 August]] [[1946]] and for delivery to the Army. 

On [[11 June]] [[1949]] USAT ''General Omar Bundy'' left [[Naples]] with 842 [[displaced persons]] from Europe and arrived in [[Sydney]] on [[20 March]] [[1949]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.immigrantships.net/v6/1900v6/generalomarbundy19490708_01.html | title = Immigrant Ships, Transcribers Guild, General Omar Bundy | publisher = ImmigrantShips.net | date = [[2002-10-28]] | accessdate = 2007-11-13 }}</ref> This voyage was one of almost 150 voyages by some 40 ships bringing refugees of World War II to Australia.<ref name=5thfleetlist>{{cite web | url = http://www.fifthfleet.net/pb/wp_6a2460ca/wp_6a2460ca.html | title = Ships of the Fifth Fleet | first = Ann | last = T<U+00FC>ndern-Smith | work = FifthFleet.net | date = [[2006-12-31]] | accessdate = 2007-11-13 }}</ref> ''General Omar Bundy'' made one more such trip herself, arriving in [[Sydney]], again, with 842 refugees on [[8 July]] [[1949]].<ref name=5thfleetlist />

The ship was returned to the Maritime Commission on [[12 December]] [[1949]]. ''General Omar Bundy'' entered the [[National Defense Reserve Fleet]] and was berthed in the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] until delivered to the [[Bethlehem Steel|Bethlehem Steel Corp.]] [[10 April]] [[1964]]. Converted to a freighter, she operated under the name ''Portmar''. She was sold to [[Ashley Steamship Co., Inc.]] on [[10 August]] [[1976]] and renamed SS ''Port''. ''Port'' was sold to [[Hamilton Eugenia Corp.]] on [[11 May]] [[1979]] and renamed SS ''Poet''. In 1980 ''Poet'' went missing and was presumed sunk.<ref name=navsrc152 />
