==History==
Jose Maria Sanchez (1804&ndash;1852), came to California from Mexico in 1825 forming a partnership with Francisco Perez Pacheco, grantee of [[Rancho Ausaymas y San Felipe]].  In 1840, Sanchez married Encarnacion Ortega (1824&ndash;1894), the daughter of Quentin Ortega and Vicenta Butron of [[Rancho San Ysidro (Ortega)|Rancho San Ysidro]].  The first rancho Sanchez bought was [[Rancho Las Animas]] from the widow of Mariano Castro in 1835.  Sanchez was granted Rancho Llano de Tesquisquita in 1835.<ref>Marjorie Pierce,1981, ''East of the Gabilans'', Western Tanager Press, ISBN 978-0934136112</ref> In 1844 Sanchez bought [[Rancho Lomerias Muertas]] from Jose A. Castro.  With thousands of cattle, Sanchez made money selling hides and tallow, the only parts of the animal worth anything. Besides trading in hides, Sanchez began manufacturing soap from the tallow. San Felipe Lake, also called Upper Soap Lake, is a permanent lake on the upper reaches of the Pajaro River.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hoover |first=Mildred B. |authorlink= |coauthors=Hero & Ethel Rensch, and William N.

With the [[Mexican Cession|cession]] of California to the United States following the [[Mexican-American War]], the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] provided that the land grants would be honored.  As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Llano de Tesquisquita was filed with the [[Public Land Commission]] in 1852,<ref>[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb109nb422&chunk.id=c01-1.3.6.4&brand=oac United States. District Court (California : Southern District) Land Case 106 SD]</ref> and the grant was [[Land patent|patented]] to Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Sanchez in 1871.<ref>[http://www.slc.ca.gov/Misc_Pages/Historical/Surveyors_General/reports/Willey_1884_1886.pdf  Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886]</ref>

With the acquisition of Rancho Lomerias Muertas, the Sanchez domain extended over {{convert|49000|acre|km2|0}} with the Pajaro River dividing his lands. Sanchez drowned in the Pajaro River on Christmas Eve, 1852, leaving his widow, Maria Encarnacion Ortega Sanchez, and five children(sisters: Vicenta; Refugia; Candelaria; Guadalupe and one brother, Jos<U+00E9> Gregorio).  Numerous people were interested in gaining control of the vast Sanchez estate.  In 1853, Maria Encarnacion Ortega Sanchez married her attorney, Thomas B. Godden. Godden was killed in the explosion of the steamboat "Jenny Lind" en route from [[Alviso, California|Alviso]] to [[San Francisco]] on April 11, 1853.  Maria Encarnacion Ortega's two husbands had died within four months of each other.  In 1853, Maria Encarnacion Ortega married Dr. Henry L. Sanford.  Sanford was killed in 1855, and Maria Encarnacion Ortega married George W. Crane (1827&ndash;1868), who died of [[Measles]] in 1868.<ref>[http://www.americahurrah.com/California/MontereyMurders/TableContents.htm  The Sanchez File] by Bill Roddy</ref>

In 1864, the Sanchez heirs started selling their share of the land to [[Henry Miller (rancher)|Henry Miller]].  By 1867, Miller and Lux owned {{convert|44000|acre|km2|0}} of the Sanchez ranchos.

In 1871, and Maria Encarnacion Ortega married her fifth husband, Anastacio Alviso, who was shot and killed shortly after their marriage.
