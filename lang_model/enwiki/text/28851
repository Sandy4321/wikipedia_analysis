'''Neuroticism''' is a fundamental  personality [[Trait theory|trait]] in the study of [[psychology]]. It is an enduring tendency to experience negative emotional states. Individuals who score high on neuroticism are more likely than the average to experience such feelings as [[anxiety]], [[anger]], [[guilt]], and depressed mood.<ref>{{Cite book

They are often [[self-conscious]] and [[shy]], and they may have trouble controlling urges and delaying [[gratification]]. Neuroticism is associated with low [[emotional intelligence]], which involves emotional regulation, motivation, and [[interpersonal skills]].<ref>{{Cite book

==Emotional stability==
On the opposite end of the spectrum, individuals who score low in neuroticism are more emotionally stable and less reactive to stress. They tend to be calm, even tempered, and less likely to feel tense or rattled. Although they are low in negative emotion, they are not necessarily high on positive emotion. That is an element of the independent trait of [[extraversion]]. Neurotic extraverts, for example, would experience high levels of both positive and negative emotional states, a kind of "emotional roller coaster". Individuals who score low on neuroticism (particularly those who are also high on extraversion) generally report more happiness and satisfaction with their lives.

==Measurement==
Like other personality traits, neuroticism is typically viewed as a continuous dimension, rather than as a distinct type of person. People vary in their level of neuroticism, with a small minority of individuals scoring extremely high or extremely low on the dimension. Because most people cluster around the average, neuroticism test scores approximate a [[normal distribution]], given a large enough sample of people. Neuroticism is one of the most studied personality traits in psychology, and this has resulted in a wealth of data and statistical analysis. It is measured on the [[Eysenck Personality Questionnaire|EPQ]], the [[NEO PI-R]], and other personality inventories.

==Physiology==
Neuroticism appears to be related to physiological differences in the brain. [[Hans Eysenck]] theorized that neuroticism is a function of activity in the [[limbic system]], and his research suggests that people who score highly on measures of neuroticism have a more reactive [[sympathetic nervous system]], and are more sensitive to environmental stimulation.<ref>{{Cite book

A study with [[positron emission tomography]] has found that healthy subjects that score high on the NEO PI-R neuroticism dimension tend to have high [[altanserin]] binding in the frontolimbic region of the brain &mdash; an indication that these subjects tend to have more of the [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor]] in that location.<ref>{{Cite journal

== Geography==
Neuroticism, along with other [[big five personality traits|personality traits]], has been mapped across states in the [[USA]]. 
People in eastern states such as New York, New Jersey, West Virginia, and Mississippi tend to score high on neuroticism, whereas people in many western states, such as Utah, Colorado, South Dakota, Oregon, and Arizona score lower on average.
People in states that are higher in neuroticism also tend to have higher rates of [[heart disease]] and lower life expectancy.<ref>{{Cite news
