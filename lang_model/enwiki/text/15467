{{Quotation|Over the past year, my initial optimism has been replaced with a realistic view of an unfortunate Governor who has become a kamikaze pilot on cruise control. First gay marriage, then a budget so bloated it made drunken sailors cringe, then driver's licenses for illegal aliens, and now this. Lawmakers in Albany have been prostituting themselves to lobbyists and special interests for decades, but this Governor has evidently taken it to a whole new level.  Early in my term as a new Assemblyman, I put my partisanship aside and looked forward to everything changing on 'Day One.'  Indeed, maybe na<U+00EF>vely, I was actually optimistic of this Governor's ability to take on the entrenched special interests in a non-partisan fashion and finally bring needed reform. Our hopes for reform have once again been sunk by the politics of personal destruction and incompetence.  This madness needs to end, and we have to finally begin focusing on the real issues: tax reform, ethics reform, term limits and a balanced budget.|Greg Ball<ref>"[http://ball4ny.com/blogEntry.aspx?entryID=116 Governor Spitzer caught in prostitution ring]".

In January of 2007, Ball became involved in a dispute with Andrea Rodgers and Keri Ann Meslar, who ran a charity polo tournament known as the "Courage Cup." Ball had been stationed at [[Bolling Air Force Base]] in [[Washington D.C.]], where he organized the first Courage Cup in 2004, raising nearly $8,000 for the [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] based [[Work to Ride ]] program and other organizations.<ref name="polo2">"[http://polhudson.lohudblogs.com/2007/06/12/polo-anyone/ Assemblyman Ball trading shots in D.C. charity polo event debate]".

A ''[[Washington Post]]'' article from June of 2007 implied that one of the event directors offered tickets at difference price level with proceeds going to a [[Political Action Committee]] which would later support Ball, although Ball's campaign stated it had nothing to do with the fund raising and that the destination of profits from the event were clearly stated on the purchase form.  Despite this, several Courage Cup supporters were surprised that what they believed were charitable contributions were used for political purposes.<ref>Argentsinger, Amy and Roberts, Roxanne.
