He gained worldwide fame as a member of [[The Beatles]], with [[John Lennon]], [[George Harrison]], and [[Ringo Starr]]. McCartney and Lennon formed one of the most influential and successful [[Lennon/McCartney|songwriting partnerships]] and "wrote some of the most popular music in rock and roll history".<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A5950929 "The Lennon-McCartney Songwriting Partnership"] ''bbc.co.uk'', [[4 November]] [[2005]]. bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2 - Retrieved 14 December 2006</ref> After leaving The Beatles, McCartney launched a successful solo career and formed the band [[Wings (band)|Wings]] with his first wife, [[Linda McCartney|Linda Eastman McCartney]], and singer-songwriter [[Denny Laine]]. He has worked on film scores, classical music, and ambient/electronic music; released a large catalogue of songs as a solo artist; and taken part in projects to help international [[Charitable organization|charities]].
	
McCartney is listed in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the most successful musician and composer in [[popular music]] history, with 60 [[Music recording sales certification|gold discs]] and sales of 100 million [[Single (music)|singles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article1089708.ece|title=Paul McCartney: When I'm 64|publisher=[[The Independent]]}} independent.co.uk - Retrieved [[17 June]] [[2006]]</ref> His song "[[Yesterday (song)|Yesterday]]" is listed as the most [[cover version|covered]] song in history  - by over 3700 artistes so far - and has been played more than 7,000,000 times on [[United States|American]] television and radio. Wings' 1977 single "[[Mull of Kintyre (song)|Mull of Kintyre]]" became the first single to sell more than two million copies in the UK, and remains the UK's top selling non-charity single.<ref>[http://ukcharts.20m.com/bestsell.html "The UK's Best Selling Singles"] ukcharts.20m.com - Retrieved [[23 September]] [[2007]].</ref>

Paul McCartney was born in Walton Hospital in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], where his mother, Mary, had worked as a nurse in the maternity ward.<ref name="SpitzPage75"> Spitz 2005. p75</ref> He has one brother, [[Mike McCartney|Michael]], born [[January 7]], [[1944]].<ref name="MilesPage4"> Miles 1998. p4.</ref> McCartney was baptised [[Roman Catholic]] but was raised [[non-denominational]]ly: his mother was Roman Catholic, and his father, James "Jim" McCartney, was a [[Protestant]] turned [[agnostic]].<ref name="MilesPage4"/>

In 1947, he began attending Stockton Wood Road Primary school. He then attended the Joseph Williams Junior School, and passed the [[11-plus]] exam in 1953 with three others out of the 90 examinees and thus gained admission to the [[Liverpool Institute]].<ref name="Milesp9"> Miles 1998. p9.</ref> In 1954, while riding on the bus to the Institute, he met [[George Harrison]], who lived nearby.<ref name="SpitzPage125"> Spitz 2005. p125</ref> Passing the exam meant that McCartney and Harrison did not have to go to a [[secondary modern]] school, which most pupils attended until they were eligible to work. It also meant that [[Grammar school]] pupils had to find new friends.<ref name="SpitzPage82-83"> Spitz 2005. pp82-83</ref>

[[Image:20 forthlin road.jpg|thumb|left|200px|20 Forthlin Road now attracts large numbers of tourists]]
In 1955 the McCartney family moved to [[20 Forthlin Road]] in [[Allerton, Merseyside|Allerton]].<ref>[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-20forthlinroadallerton/w-20forthlinroadallerton-seeanddo.htm Photo of Forthlin Road] nationaltrust.org.uk - Retrieved 27 January 2007 </ref> Mary McCartney rode a bicycle to houses where she was needed as a [[midwife]], and an early McCartney memory is of her leaving when it was snowing heavily.<ref name="MilesPage6"> Miles 1998. p6.</ref> On [[31 October]] [[1956]], Mary McCartney (who was a heavy smoker) died of an [[embolism]] after a [[mastectomy]] operation to stop the spread of her [[breast cancer]].<ref name="MilesPage20"> Miles 1998. p20.</ref> The early loss of his mother later connected McCartney with [[John Lennon]], whose mother, [[Julia Lennon|Julia]], died when Lennon was 17.<ref name="MilesPage31"> Miles 1998. p31.</ref>

McCartney's father was a trumpet player and pianist who had led Jim Mac's Jazz Band in the 1920s. He encouraged his two sons to be musical.<ref name="MilesPage22"> Miles 1998. p22.</ref> Jim had an [[upright piano]] in the front room that he had bought from [[Harry Epstein]]'s store, and McCartney's grandfather, Joe McCartney, played an [[E-flat major|E-flat]] [[tuba]].<ref name="SpitzPage71"> Spitz 2005.

McCartney, being left-handed, found the Zenith difficult to play.

McCartney formed a close working relationship with Lennon and they collaborated on many songs. He convinced Lennon to allow Harrison to join The Quarrymen (Lennon thought Harrison was too young) after Lennon heard Harrison play at a rehearsal in March 1958.<ref name=" SpitzPage126-127"> Spitz 2005. pp126-127</ref> Harrison joined the group as [[lead guitarist]], followed by Lennon's [[art school]] friend, [[Stuart Sutcliffe]], on bass, although McCartney was later dismissive about Sutcliffe's musical ability.<ref name="MilesPage47-50"> Miles 1998. pp47-50.</ref><ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnPage94"> Cynthia Lennon <U+201C>John<U+201D> 2006. p94.</ref> By May 1960, they had tried several new names, including [[The Quarrymen|The Silver Beetles]]; playing a tour of Scotland under that name with [[Larry Parnes|Johnny Gentle]].

{{main|The Beatles}}
Starting in May 1960, The Beatles were managed by [[Allan Williams]], who booked them into [[Bruno Koschmider]]'s Indra club in [[Hamburg]]. McCartney's father was reluctant to let the teenage McCartney go to Hamburg until McCartney pointed out that he would earn <U+20A4>2/10s per day. As this was more than he earned himself, Jim finally agreed.<ref name="MilesPage57"> Miles 1998. p57.</ref>
[[Image:Indra-Club-Hamburg.png|right|thumb|The Indra Club,Hamburg where the Beatles first played]]
The Beatles first played at the Indra club, sleeping in small, "dirty" rooms in the [[Bruno Koschmider|Bambi Kino]], and then moved (after the closure of the Indra) to the larger [[Kaiserkeller]].<ref name="MilesPage57-58"> Miles 1998. pp57-8.</ref> In October 1960, they left Koschmider's club and worked at the "Top Ten Club", which was run by Peter Eckhorn.<ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnPage93"> Cynthia Lennon <U+201C>John<U+201D> 2006. p93.</ref><ref name="MilesPage71-72"> Miles 1998. pp. 71<U+2013>72.</ref> When McCartney and [[Pete Best]] went back to the Bambi Kino to get their belongings they found it in almost total darkness. As a snub to Koschmider, they found a [[condom]], attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of their room, and set fire to it. There was no real damage, but Koschmider reported them for attempted [[arson]]. McCartney and Best spent three hours in a local jail and were deported, as was Harrison, for working under the legal age limit.<ref name="MilesPage72-73"> Miles 1998. pp72-73.</ref> Lennon's [[work permit]] was revoked a few days later and he went home by train, but Sutcliffe had a cold and stayed in Hamburg, and then flew home.<ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnp79"> Cynthia Lennon <U+201C>John<U+201D> 2006. p79.</ref>

The group reunited in December 1960, and on [[21 March]] [[1961]], played their first of many concerts at Liverpool's [[Cavern club]].<ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnp84"> Cynthia Lennon <U+201C>John<U+201D> 2006. p84.</ref><ref name="Page80"> Lewisohn 2002. p80</ref> McCartney realised that other Liverpool bands were playing the same cover songs, which prompted him and Lennon to write more original material.<ref name="MilesPage81-82"> Miles 1998. pp81-82.</ref> The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, and recorded "[[My Bonnie]]" with [[Tony Sheridan]].<ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnp97"> Cynthia Lennon <U+201C>John<U+201D> 2006. p97.</ref> Sutcliffe left the band after the end of their contract, so McCartney reluctantly took over [[bass guitar|bass]].<ref name="MilesPage74"> Miles 1998. p74.</ref> After borrowing Sutcliffe's H<U+00F5>fner 500/5 model for a short time, he bought a left-handed 1962 500/1 model [[H<U+00F6>fner]] bass.<ref name="BabiukPage49">Babiuk. pp 49-50.</ref><ref>[http://www.thecanteen.com/mccartney2.html Rosetti Solid 7] thecanteen.com - Retrieved 14 December 2006 </ref> On [[1 October]] [[1961]], McCartney went with Lennon (who paid for the trip) to [[Paris]] for two weeks.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp99"> Cynthia Lennon <U+201C>John<U+201D> 2006. p99.</ref>

Lennon, Harrison, and Starr lived in large houses in the '[[stockbroker belt]]' of southern England,<ref name="MilesPage166-167"> Miles 1998. pp166-167</ref> but McCartney continued to live in central London: in Jane Asher's parents' house, and then at 7 Cavendish Avenue, [[St John's Wood]], near the [[Abbey Road Studios]].<ref name="MilesPage166-167"/> It was at Cavendish Avenue that McCartney bought his first [[Old English Sheepdog]], Martha, which inspired the song "[[Martha My Dear]]".<ref name="MilesPage262"> Miles 1998. p262</ref>

McCartney often went to nightclubs alone, which offered 'dining and dancing until 4:00 a.m.' and featured [[cabaret]] acts.<ref name="MilesPage129"> Miles 1998. p129</ref> McCartney would get preferential treatment everywhere he went, which he readily accepted.<ref name="MilesPage130-131"> Miles 1998. pp130-131</ref> He even once accepted an offer from a [[Policing in the United Kingdom|policeman]] to be allowed to park McCartney's car.<ref name="MilesPage129"/> He later visited [[gambling]] clubs after 4:00am, such as 'The Curzon House', and often saw Brian Epstein there.<ref name="MilesPage131"> Miles 1998. p131</ref> The [[Ad Lib]] club (above the Prince Charles Theatre at 7 Leicester Place) was later opened for the emerging 'Rock and Roll' crowd of musicians, and tolerated their unusual lifestyle.<ref name="MilesPage132-133"> Miles 1998. pp132-133</ref> After the Ad Lib fell out of favour, McCartney moved on to the [[Scotch of St James]], at 13 Masons Yard.<ref name="MilesPage134"> Miles 1998. p134</ref> He also frequented [[The Bag O'Nails]] club at 8 Kingly Street in [[Soho]], [[London]], where he met [[Linda Eastman]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3023903.stm The Bag o<U+2019>Nails - 13 May 2003] bbc.co.uk - Retrieved 16 November 2006</ref><ref name="Wingspandvd"/>

On [[12 June]] [[1965]], The Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire ([[Order of the British Empire|MBE]]); they received their insignia from [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] at an [[investiture]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] on [[26 October]] [[1965]]. They stopped touring after their last concert at [[Candlestick Park]], [[San Francisco]], on [[29 August]] [[1966]]. The other three Beatles had often talked about stopping touring, but after the Candlestick Park concert, and after having played so many concerts where they could not be heard, McCartney finally agreed that they should stop playing live concerts.<ref name="MilesPage293-295"> Miles 1998. pp293-295.</ref>

McCartney later attempted to persuade Lennon and Harrison to return to the stage, and when they had a meeting to sign a new contract with [[Capitol Records]], McCartney suggested "going back to our roots," to which Lennon replied, "I think you're mad!"<ref name="WingspanPage9"> Wingspan 2001. p9</ref> Although Lennon had quit the group in September 1969, and Harrison and Starr had temporarily left the group at various times, McCartney was the one who publicly announced [[The Beatles' breakup]] on [[10 April]] [[1970]]<U+2014>one week before releasing his first solo album, ''[[McCartney (album)|McCartney]]''.<ref name="SpitzPage858"> Spitz 2005. p858.</ref> The album included a press release inside with a self-written interview stating McCartney's hopes about the future.

Those are the moments I treasure.<ref name="bharry1">The Paul McCartney Encyclopedia, article "Lennon, John"</ref>}}

In a ''[[Playboy]]'' interview in 1984, McCartney said that he went home that night and watched the news on television<U+2014>while sitting with all his children<U+2014>and cried all evening. His last telephone call to Lennon, which was just before Lennon and Yoko released ''[[Double Fantasy]]'', was friendly.

During the '60s, McCartney was often seen at major cultural events, such as the launch party for The ''[[International Times]]'', and at [[The Roundhouse]] ([[28 January]] and [[4 February]], [[1967]]).<ref name="CarnivalofLightInterview">[http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/carnival.htm  <U+201C>The Carnival of Light<U+201D> interview] abbeyrd.best.vwh.net - Retrieved 16 November 2006</ref> He also delved into the visual arts, becoming a close friend of leading art dealers and gallery owners, explored experimental film, and regularly attended movie, theatrical and classical music performances.
His first contact with the London [[avant-garde]] scene was through [[John Dunbar]], who introduced him to the art dealer [[Robert Fraser]], who in turn introduced McCartney to an array of writers and artists.

Shortly after McCartney returned from Hamburg in May 1962, Rhone told him that she was pregnant. They told Jim McCartney<U+2014>whom they expected to be shocked at the news<U+2014>but found him delighted at the prospect of becoming a grandfather. McCartney took out a marriage licence and set the wedding date for November; shortly before the baby was due.<ref name="Spitzp319-320"> Spitz 2005 pp319-320</ref> Rhone had a [[miscarriage]] in July 1962, and after a few weeks, McCartney's feelings towards Rhone "cooled off" and he finished their relationship.<ref name="Spitzp348"> Spitz 2005 p348</ref>

Rhone later emigrated to [[Toronto, Canada]], and McCartney met her again when The Beatles played there, and then again with Wings. Rhone said that "[[Love of the Loved]]" and "[[P.S. I Love You (The Beatles song)|P.S. I Love You]]" were written about her. Years later, Cynthia Lennon gave back Rhone the gold ring that McCartney had bought in Hamburg, as Cynthia had once tried it on when Rhone was washing dishes, and had forgotten to take it off.

McCartney's lifestyle was greatly altered by his success and the income he earned.

===Recreational drug use===

After having been introduced to [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], by [[Bob Dylan]] in [[New York]], in 1964, McCartney remembered getting "very high" and giggling.<ref name="MilesPage188-189">Miles 1998,  p. 188-189</ref> McCartney's use of cannabis became regular, and he was quoted in the [[Barry Miles]] book as saying that any future Beatles' lyrics containing the words "high", or "grass" were written specifically as a reference to cannabis<U+2014>as was "[[Got to Get You into My Life]]".<ref name="MilesPage190">Miles 1998, p. 190.</ref> [[John Dunbar|John Dunbar's]] flat at 29 Lennox Gardens, in London, became a regular hang-out for McCartney, where he talked to musicians, writers and artists, and smoked cannabis.<ref name="MilesPage217"/> In 1965, Miles introduced McCartney to [[Cannabis brownie|hash brownies]] by using a recipe for [[Hashish|hash]] fudge he found in the [[Alice B.

[[Image:Marijuana.jpg|left|thumb|McCartney called for the legalization of ''Cannabis'' in 1967.]]
McCartney's attitude about cannabis was made public in the 1960s, when he added his name to an advertisement in ''[[The Times]]'', on [[24 July]] [[1967]], which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The [[advertisement]] was sponsored by a group called Soma and was signed by 65 people, including The Beatles, [[Brian Epstein]], [[Graham Greene]], [[Ronald David Laing|R.D.

{{cquote | I was asked a question by a newspaper, and the decision was whether to tell a lie or tell him the truth. I decided to tell him the truth ... but I really didn't want to say anything, you know, because if I had my way I wouldn't have told anyone. I'm not trying to spread the word about this. But the man from the newspaper is the man from the mass medium. I'll keep it a personal thing if he does too, you know ... if he keeps it quiet. But he wanted to spread it so it's his responsibility, you know, for spreading it, not mine.}}

In another quote (cited and endorsed by The Byrds' David Crosby at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]]), McCartney said, {{cquote | [LSD] opened my eyes. We only use one-tenth of our brain. Just think of what we could accomplish if we could only tap that hidden part! It would mean a whole new world if the politicians would take LSD. There wouldn't be any more war or poverty or famine.}}

==Paul is dead rumours==
<!--Put references into this article or your edit will be deleted-->
{{main|Paul is dead}}
"Paul is Dead" is an urban legend alleging that McCartney died in 1966 and was replaced by a [[look-alike]] and [[sound-alike]]. The rumour is the subject of several books, including American journalist Andru J. Reeve's 1994 book ''Turn Me On, Dead Man'' (ISBN 1-4184-8294-3) and English author Benjamin Fitzpatrick's 1997 book, 'Rumours from John, George, Ringo and Me'."Paul is dead" analyst Joel Glazier hypothesized in a 1978 [[treatise]] that Lennon's love of [[wordplay]] and studio editing may have been responsible for clues in later Beatles albums.<ref>Joel Glazier, "Paul Is Dead... Miss Him, Miss Him," Strawberry Fields Forever #51 (1978), pp. 21-22.</ref>
