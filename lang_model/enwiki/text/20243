'''King's Highway 68''', commonly referred to as '''Highway 68''', was a [[Highways in Ontario|provincially maintained highway]] on [[Manitoulin Island]], linking the island to the [[mainland]]. It was connected to the rest of the network at [[McKerrow, Ontario|McKerrow]], where it met [[Ontario Highway 17|Highway&nbsp;17]]. The road was built in the 1920s as a trunk road for the [[Department of Northern Development]] (later merged into the Department of Highways, today's [[Ministry of Transportation of Ontario|Ministry of Transportation]]), but was assumed as a provincial highway in 1937, as the only King's Highway on the island. Highway&nbsp;68 stretched from [[South Baymouth, Ontario|South Baymouth]] in the south, through the towns of [[Manitowaning, Ontario|Manitowaning]] and [[Little Current, Ontario|Little Current]] north to [[Espanola, Ontario|Espanola]] on the mainland.

Highway&nbsp;68 was a {{convert|116.8|km|abbr=on}} route that crossed the eastern side of Manitoulin Island in a north<U+2013>south orientation between South Baymouth and Little Current. North of there, it travelled through the [[La Cloche Peninsula]] en route to Espanola and Highway&nbsp;17. However, in 1980 the route was renumbered as a northern "extension" of Highway&nbsp;6. The two segments of the highway are connected by the seasonal [[Chi-Cheemaun]] ferry service that travels between [[Tobermory, Ontario|Tobermory]] and South Baymouth. This service only operates from May through October.<ref name="2010 mapart">{{cite map

Today, the former routing is surrounded by farms and ranges outside of the numerous communities it interconnects on Manitoulin Island. On the mainland, the highway passes through mountainous terrain and the rugged [[Canadian Shield]].<ref>{{Google maps

== History ==
[[File:Little Current Swing Bridge Ontario.jpg|thumb|right|The Little Current Swing Bridge connects Manitoulin Island to the mainland.]]
The history of Highway&nbsp;68 dates to 1929, when the [[Department of Northern Development]] (DND) constructed a {{convert|56|km|abbr=on}} gravel road between McKerrow and Goat Island. From there, a railway and ferry crossed the [[North Channel (Lake Huron)|North Channel]] to [[Little Current, Ontario|Little Current]] on [[Manitoulin Island]]. On April 1, 1937, the DND merged into the [[Department of Highways]] (DHO), and the latter began to assume and number trunk roadways in central and northern Ontario. On August&nbsp;11, 1937, the DHO took control of the Little Current Road.<ref name="assumed">{{cite report

 | section   = Appendix 3 - Schedule of Assumptions and Reversions
 | page      = 80}}</ref>
At its northern terminus, Highway&nbsp;17 was rerouted in 1939, bypassing the old alignment between Webbwood and McKerrow. As a result, Highway&nbsp;68 was extended north by {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} to meet this new alignment.<ref>{{cite report

During [[World War II]], the rail bridge over the North Channel was abandoned, and subsequently redecked for highway use in 1945. Highway&nbsp;68 was extended across the channel to Little Current, increasing its length by {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}}. However, Manitoulin Island would still remain without a highway of its own until the mid-1950s. On December&nbsp;7, 1955, the route was extended {{convert|41.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} across the island to South Baymooth.<ref>{{cite report

While the road was re-aligned somewhat throughout its history (many of the re-alignments took place in the late 1950s and early 1960s), and its overall path has not changed, its length has varied considerably during re-alignments, creeping as high as 130&nbsp;km during the 1960s, before settling back down to its current value of around 116&nbsp;km. Some former alignments (such as "Devil's Elbow Road") are still in use. The road was fully paved by 1973, making this road the second last Kings Highways in the province to be paved in its entirety (with the last being [[Ontario Highway 129|Highway 129]]).<ref>{{cite map

During the spring of 1980, the entire length of Highway&nbsp;68 was renumbered as part of Highway&nbsp;6.<ref>{{cite press release

The two discontinuous sections of Highway&nbsp;6 are linked only by a privately operated ferry, [[MS Chi-Cheemaun]], which crosses [[Georgian Bay]] daily from May to October between South Baymouth and [[Tobermory, Ontario|Tobermory]].<ref>{{cite web
