'''Arowanas''', also known as '''aruanas''' or '''arawanas''' are [[fresh water|freshwater]] [[bony fish]] of the family '''Osteoglossidae''', sometimes known as "bony tongues." In this family of fishes, the head is bony and the elongate body is covered by large, heavy scales, with a mosaic pattern of canals. The dorsal and the anal fins have soft rays and are long based, while the pectoral and ventral fins are small. The name 'bony tongues' is derived from a toothed bone on the floor of the mouth, the 'tongue', equipped with teeth that bite against teeth on the roof of the mouth. The fish can obtain oxygen from air by sucking it into the [[gas bladder|swim bladder]], which is lined with capillaries like [[lung|lung tissue]]. The [[arapaima]] is an "obligatory air breather".<ref> Berra, Tim M. (2001). ''Freshwater Fish Distribution''. San Diego: Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-093156-7</ref>

==Classification and zoogeography==
Osteoglossids are [[primitive (biology)|basal]] (primitive) fish from the [[Tertiary|lower Tertiary]] and are placed in the [[actinopterygii]]d order [[Osteoglossiformes]]. There are ten described living [[species]]: three from [[South America]], one from [[Africa]], four from [[Asia]], and the remaining two from [[Australia]].

Osteoglossidae is the only exclusively freshwater fish family found on both sides of the [[Wallace Line]].<ref>{{cite paper  | author = Ismail, Mohd Zakaria | title = Systematics, Zoogeography, and Conservation of the Freshwater Fishes of Peninsular Malaysia | version =  | publisher =  Colorado State University | date = 1989 | format = doctoral dissertation | pages = p. 25}}</ref> This may be explained by the fact that [[Asian arowana]]s  (''S. formosus'') diverged from the Australian ''Scleropages'', ''S. jardinii'' and ''S. leichardti'', about 140 million years ago, making it likely that Asian arowanas were carried to [[Asia]] on the [[Indian subcontinent]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Kumazawa | first = Yoshinori | coauthors = Nishida, Mutsumi | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 17 | issue = 12 | year = 2000 | title = Molecular Phylogeny of Osteoglossoids: A New Model for Gondwanian Origin and Plate Tectonic Transportation of the Asian Arowana | url = http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/17/12/1869 | accessdate = 2006-07-12 | pmid = 11110903 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Kumazawa | first = Yoshinori | journal = Quarterly Journal Biohistory | issue = Winter | year = 2003 | title = The reason the freshwater fish arowana live across the sea | url = http://www.brh.co.jp/en/experience/journal/39/research_1.html | accessdate = 2006-07-02 }}</ref>

==Behavior==
Osteoglossids are [[carnivore|carnivorous]], often being specialized surface feeders. They are excellent jumpers; it has been reported that ''Osteoglossum'' species have been seen leaping more than 6 feet (almost 2 metres) from the water surface to pick off insects and birds from overhanging branches in South America, hence the nickname "water monkeys". Arowanas have been rumored to capture prey as large as low flying bats and small birds. All species are large, and the [[arapaima]] is a contender for the world's [[largest fish in the world|largest freshwater fish]] title. Arowana typically grow around 3 to 4 feet, but this is only accountable in captivity.

Several species of osteoglossid exhibit extensive parental care. They build nests and protect the young after they hatch. Some species are [[Mouthbrooder|mouth brooders]], the parents holding sometimes hundreds of eggs in their mouths. The young may make several tentative trips outside the parent's mouth to investigate the surroundings before leaving permanently.

==In the aquarium==
Arowanas tend to merge in groups of 5 to 8; any fewer may show an excess of dominance and aggression. Keep this fish in a minimum of about 750 [[litre]]s (240 gallons)for a single fish with good filtration, add another 100 for every other fish kept. This fish should not be purchased by an amateur fish hobbyist. Some compatible fish to partner with this fish are [[clown knifefish]], [[pacu]], [[Oscar (fish)|oscars]], [[plecostomus]], [[jaguar cichlid]]s, [[green terror]]s, [[gar]] and any other semi-aggressive fish that cannot fit in the arowana's mouth.

Australian species should be kept singly in aquaria.<ref>Native Fish Australia, Saratoga - http://www.nativefish.asn.au/saratoga.html</ref><ref>Native Fish Australia, Gulf Saratoga - http://www.nativefish.asn.au/gulf_saratoga.html</ref>

== Folklore ==
[[Image:Seattle-ShuizuGuan-Silver-Arowanas-picture-3122.JPG|thumb|This storefront in the [[International District, Seattle, Washington|International District]] of [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington]], is an example of the depiction of arowanas in [[folk art]].]]
For the Chinese and those of related cultures, the [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] is a symbol of good luck and prosperity. In the eyes of the Chinese, the dragon fish has the appearance and majesty of the Chinese Dragon, especially the large scales and [[barbel (anatomy)|barbel]]s.

Arowanas are also used for [[feng shui]] to bring good luck and wealth.

==Species==
The family contains two [[subfamily|subfamilies]], Heterotidinae and Osteoglossinae, with all but 
two of the ten extant species being members of the latter. Species are given with one or more prominent common names.

<sup><U+2021></sup>This species is one of two sometimes called the Australian arowana or Australian bonytongue.

A genetic study shows that the lineage leading to the arapaima and African arowana diverged about 220 million years ago, during the [[Late Triassic]]; the lineage leading to the silver and black arowanas of South America diverged about 170 million years ago, during the [[Middle Jurassic]].  The lineage leading to the Australian arowanas diverged from that leading to the Asian arowanas about 140 million years ago, during the [[Early Cretaceous]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Kumazawa | first = Yoshinori | journal = Quarterly Journal Biohistory | issue = Winter | year = 2003 | title = The reason the freshwater fish arowana live across the sea | url = http://www.brh.co.jp/en/experience/journal/39/research_1.html | accessdate = 2006-07-02 }}</ref>

==Fossil record==
At least five fish [[paleospecies]], known only from fossils, are classified as Osteoglossids; these date back at least as far as the [[Late Cretaceous]]. Other fossils from as far back as the [[Late Jurassic]] or [[Early Cretaceous]] are widely considered to belong to the arowana superorder [[Osteoglossomorpha]]. Osteoglossomorph fossils have been found on all continents except Antarctica.<ref name="guo">{{cite web | last = Guo-Qing | first = Li | coauthors = Wilson, Mark V.

===Genus ''Brychaetus''===
''Brychaetus muelleri'' ([[Louis Agassiz|Agassiz]], [[1845]]) is known from the [[Late Cretaceous]] to the [[Paleocene]]. Its fossils have been found in [[Europe]], [[North America]], and northern [[Africa]]. This freshwater fish had very long, blunt teeth. ''Platops'' and ''Pomphractus'' are synonyms.<ref name="frickhinger">{{cite book | last = Frickhinger | first = Karl Albert | others = Trans. Dr. R.P.S.

===Genus ''Joffrichthys''===
This [[North America]]n genus includes two species, ''J. symmetropterus'' and ''J. triangulpterus''. The latter species is known from the [[Paleocene]] of the [[Sentinel Butte Formation]] of [[North Dakota]], [[United States|U.S.A.]]<ref name="newbreya">{{cite journal | last = Newbreya | first = M.

===Genus ''Phareodus''===
This genus includes at least two species, ''P. testis'' ([[Joseph Leidy|Leidy]], [[1873]]) and ''P. encaustus''. Representatives have been found from the middle [[Eocene]] to the [[Oligocene]] of Australia and North America, including the [[Green River Formation]] in [[Wyoming]], [[United States|U.S.A.]]<ref name="frickhinger"/>

''P. testis'' was a freshwater fish with an oval outline, a small head, and a slightly pointed snout. Its [[dorsal fin|dorsal]] and [[anal fin|anal]] fins were situated posteriorly, with the anal fin being larger. Its [[caudal fin]] was slightly forked. It had small [[pelvic fin]]s but long, narrow [[pectoral fin]]s. It is synonymous with ''Dapedoglossus''.<ref name="frickhinger"/>
