'''Katsu''' (sometimes '''KATSU''') was an [[United States|American]] [[rock band]] from [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]], [[Pennsylvania]], from 2001&ndash;06. Their musical style was self-described as a cross between [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and the music of [[Bob Dylan]], along with mixtures of [[classic rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[punk rock]], [[reggae]], and [[ska]]. Many of the band's themes dealt with "explorations of life, love, broken hearts and lost innocence in [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] America".<ref>Q94 the Classic Rock Station.

== History ==
=== Beginnings ===
[[Singer-songwriter]] and [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitarist]] Dennis Fallon, [[bassist|bass guitarist]] Frank Yarnal, [[guitarist]] William Love, and [[drummer]] Ralph Jones formed the band '''Forty Pound Test''' in State College in 1999.<ref>''The Daily Collegian''. "[http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/1999/09/09-10-99tdc/09-10-99darts-11.asp Forty Pound Test brings energy to stage]". September 10, 1999.</ref> The band was named after Jones' late uncle, an avid fisherman. When Jones left the band in 2001, the remaining members reformed as Katsu and added Eric Rozzi as replacement drummer. The band's new name derived from a quote in Phillip Toshio Sudo's book ''Zen Guitar'': "KATSU: A shout that emanates from the soul. Martial artists call this kind of shout [[Katsu (Zen)|katsu]]. Katsu is the roar of a person who knows what it means to be alive".

Katsu began playing mostly as a [[cover band]] in popular bars and taverns in downtown State College, such as The [[Rathskeller]], The Saloon, and The Lion's Den, although they substantially reinterpreted cover songs and regularly included original songs into their performances. Along with Dylan, other artists who influenced the band's sound included the [[Beastie Boys]], [[Mike Ness]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], and [[Tom Petty]]. The band chose "Katsu is watching you!" as their slogan for use on their website and bumper stickers.

The band released a basement [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] album retroactively called ''Songs for Jake'' (also ''Jake's Greatest Hits'') in 2001.

=== Radio ===
Katsu was often featured on Penn State's student radio station, [[WKPS]] - The Lion 90.7 FM on an afternoon show titled "State Your Face", which featured rock, oldies, punk, reggae, and ska. They had a number of in-studio interviews and performances in 2004 with WKPS DJ Kip Talley.

=== ''Gorgeous Mess'' ===

In December 2001, the band began recording their first album ''[[Gorgeous Mess]]''. Bret Alexander and Paul Smith of [[The Badlees]] produced the record, which took six months to finish. Love left during the recording process and was replaced with [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] guitarist Mark Klein. 

The record, which was chosen as the best independent album by ''Pennsylvania Musician'' magazine in 2003, included the songs "Leave Me", "Anymore" and "Walkaway", an [[anthem rock]]er about growing up in Pennsylvania. Yarnal explained the band's success: "Our live show is very energetic. We like to interact with the crowd. We have a lot of catchy sing-a-long choruses. There is never a dull moment."<ref>''The Daily Collegian''. "[http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2003/02/02-05-03tdc/02-05-03darts-01.asp Sev-up]". February 5, 2003.</ref>

Rozzi left the band after the record's completion and was replaced with Keith Lingenfelter, a high school friend of Klein.

=== ''Disaster'' ===
After completing ''Gorgeous Mess'', the band began writing new songs, which led to another basement bootleg album in 2003, ''Elvis in Furs''. Katsu was signed to [[The Badlees]]' record label Saturation Acres Music of [[Danville, Pennsylvania]], and from August &ndash; October 2003 recorded their second album ''[[Disaster (album)|Disaster]]'' at Saturation Acres Studio, again under the production of Alexander and Smith. The record, released in 2004 featured the [[punk rock]]er "Cold Stop", "Down The Line" and the [[southern rock]]er "Prison Break". Lingenfelter left the band shortly after the album's release and was replaced with drummer Josh Troup, giving the band its final lineup.

=== Touring ===

During the band's existence Katsu played throughout Pennsylvania, including the Grape Street Pub of [[Manayunk, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Manayunk, Philadelphia]], popular for its original music performances, and the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], as well as playing in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. Katsu featured at the [[Penn State Dance Marathon]] and served as the opening acts for [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]] and [[Jason Mraz]]. Regarding the latter act, Fallon said, "Yeah, we played a show with all the screaming 12-year-old girls. We also opened for the '80s metal band [[FireHouse (band)|FireHouse]]. We don't really match that scene, either. It was pretty wacky."<ref>''The Daily Collegian''. "[http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2004/09/09-07-04tdc/09-07-04darts-01.asp Dexter Freebish plays at Crowbar as part of back-to-school concert]." September 7, 2004.</ref> State College remained the band's base, however, despite the propensity of a rural [[Pennsylvania State University|university town]] for cover songs. Fallon explained, "State College is our base of operations. This is where we learned how to play."<ref>''The Daily Collegian''. "[http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2003/08/08-07-03tdc/08-07-03darts-06.asp Katsu to open in capital for national pop act Mraz]". August 7, 2003.</ref>

=== Later recordings ===
For the [[MTV]]-produced [[compilation album]] ''Lit Riffs: The Soundtrack'' in 2004, Katsu supplied a stripped-down [[cover version]] of [[Grandmaster Flash|Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five]]'s "[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]". In 2005 the band released the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[The Basement Albums Vol. 3]]'', a collection of new tracks (recorded in a basement) and recordings of older songs from live shows. Chris Rosengrant, manager of The Lion's Den, praised the band that year by saying, "Their music is fantastic and their interaction with the crowd is great."<ref>''The Daily Collegian''. "[http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2005/02/02-24-05tdc/02-24-05darts-08.asp Katsu releases new CD]". February 24, 2005</ref>

In January 2006, the band released the EP ''[[A World on End]]'', a compilation of songs from earlier recordings with the new song "Please Don't Start".

Katsu disbanded in May 2006. Along with three other State College musicians, Fallon and Yarnal formed the band Lowjack in June 2006; the new band premiered at The Rathskeller in August that year. On September 28, 2007, Katsu reunited for a single show at The Rathskeller.
