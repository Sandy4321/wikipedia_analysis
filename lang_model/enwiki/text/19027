[[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] '''Henry Inman''' (1762 &ndash; 15 July 1809) was a British [[Royal Navy]] officer during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, serving in the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Inman's service in the American war was punctuated by three [[shipwreck]]s: the burning of [[HMS Lark (1762)|HMS ''Lark'']] off [[Rhode Island]] in the face of a superior French squadron, the grounding of [[HMS Santa Monica|HMS ''Santa Monica'']] on [[Tortola]] and the foundering of [[French ship Hector (1756)|''Hector'']] following an engagement with two French ships in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Mid-Atlantic]]. After the war he was placed in reserve until the [[Spanish Armament]] of 1790, when he was given command of the 14-gun [[HMS Pygmy|HMS ''Pygmy'']] stationed off the [[Isle of Man]].

Inman's subsequent service career was principally in [[frigate]]s: he was engaged at the [[Siege of Toulon]] in [[HMS Aurore|HMS ''Aurore'']], in a raid at [[Dunkirk]] in [[HMS Andromeda (1784)|HMS ''Andromeda'']] and participated in the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|Battle of Copenhagen]] as captain of [[HMS Desiree (1800)|HMS ''D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9>e'']]. He later served on the [[ship of the line]] [[HMS Triumph (1764)|HMS ''Triumph'']] at the [[Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)|Battle of Cape Finisterre]] and was subsequently called to give evidence at the court martial of [[Robert Calder|Sir Robert Calder]]. After the battle off Finisterre, Inman suffered from ill-health and remained on shore duty until 1809 when he was appointed as Admiralty commissioner for [[Madras]]. The lengthy sea journey to [[India]] exacerbated his existing health problems and he died just ten days after his arrival.

==Early Life==
Henry Inman was born in 1762, the son of the vicar of the [[Somerset]] village of [[Burrington, Somerset|Burrington]], Reverend George Inman. Educated by his father until the age of 14, Inman was sent to join the [[Royal Navy]] in 1776, posted aboard the 90-gun [[second rate]] [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS ''Barfleur'']].<ref name="NT205">Tracy, p. 205</ref> ''Barfleur''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s captain was [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Sir Samuel Hood]], later to become [[Viscount Hood]], who formed a close personal and professional attachment to his subordinate that continued throughout Inman's military service. After two years on ''Barfleur'', Inman was transferred to the [[frigate]] [[HMS Lark (1762)|HMS ''Lark'']] in 1778 for service off [[New England]]. The [[American Revolutionary War]] had broken out three years earlier, but ''Barfleur'' had been based in Britain and so there had been no opportunity for action aboard Hood's ship. His career in ''Lark'' was cut short on 5 August 1778, when Captain [[John Brisbane]], the senior officer off Rhode Island, ordered the frigate beached and burnt with four other ships when a French fleet under Vice-Admiral [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|Comte d'Estaing]] appeared off the harbour.<ref name="JC293">Campbell, p. 293</ref> Inman and the rest of the crew were transferred to shore duties and over the following week engaged D'Estaing's ships from fixed gun batteries as they bombarded the British positions.<ref name="NT205"/> 

Inman had lost all his personal possessions in the destruction of ''Lark'' and was forced to replace his uniform from his own wages when the Navy refused to provide compensation. Returning to Britain in the frigate [[HMS Pearl (1762)|HMS ''Pearl'']], Inman was promoted to lieutenant in 1780 and returned to the Americas in [[HMS Camel|HMS ''Camel'']], transferred soon afterwards into [[HMS Santa Monica|HMS ''Santa Monica'']] in the [[West Indies]].<ref name="JC293"/> Shortly after his arrival however, Inman was once again shipwrecked when ''Santa Monica'' grounded off [[Tortola]]. Although the crew reached the shore in small boats, the ship broke up rapidly and once again Inman lost all of his possessions.<ref name="JC294">Campbell, p. 294</ref> Remaining on shore service in the West Indies for the next two years, Inman was again employed in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Saintes]], appointed to the prize crew of the captured French vessel [[French ship Hector (1756)|''Hector'']] for the journey to Britain.<ref name="NT206">Tracy, p. 206</ref> ''Hector''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s masts and hull had been seriously damaged in the battle, requiring lighter spars to be fitted and 22 of her 74 guns removed to make her more seaworthy. As men could not be spared from the fleet, the 223-strong prize crew was made up of men [[impressment|pressed]] in the Caribbean, principally invalids unfit for frontline service.<ref name="JC294"/>

On 14 August 1782, ''Hector'' was separated from the rest of the prize ships in heavy weather and on 22 August encountered two large French frigates, [[French frigate Aigle (1782)|''Aigle'']] of 40 guns and [[French frigate Gloire|''Gloire'']] of 32 guns. Together these vessels significantly outclassed the leaky ship of the line in weight of shot, but Captain John Bourchier determined to resist the French attack, preparing ''Hector'' as the French approached.<ref name="NT206"/> The French ships surrounded ''Hector'' at 02:00 and the engagement was furiously contested, with Bourchier wounded early on and many of his officers following him below with serious injuries.<ref name="JC295">Campbell, p. 295</ref> Within a short period, Inman was the only officer remaining on deck, but he was able to successfully drive the French away following a failed attempt to board, although ''Hector'' was left in a severely damaged state with 75 men killed or wounded.<ref name="WLC87">Clowes, p. 87</ref> A hurricane that followed the battle inflicted further damage and the ship was badly flooded, seawater ruining the food supplies and threatening to sink the ship completely. Some of the crew were so ill and exhausted that they collapsed and died while manning the pumps, Inman only managing to prevent the remaining sailors from fleeing below decks by carrying loaded pistols and threatening men who refused his orders. Once the storm had abated it was clear that ''Hector'' was foundering, her rudder and masts torn away and the pumps unable to keep pace with the water leaking through the battered hull.<ref name="JC295"/> For two weeks Inman made desperate efforts to keep the ship afloat, as food and water supplies ran low and the hull began to collapse in on itself. Fortunately for the men aboard ''Hector'', the tiny [[snow (ship)|snow]] ''Hawke'' appeared and approached the ship of the line to render assistance. Throwing his cargo overboard, Captain John Hill worked with Inman to supervise the transfer of all of ''Hector''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s remaining men, many of whom were wounded or sick, into ''Hawke'' as ''Hector'' rapidly sank.<ref name="NT206"/> No men were lost in the operation and Inman was the last to leave the ship of the line, ''Hector'' disappearing ten minutes after the last boat reached ''Hawke''. The snow set sail for [[St John's, Newfoundland|St John's]] in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], its crew and passengers subsisting on short rations and arriving off the port on the same day as the consumption of the last water supplies.<ref name="JC297">Campbell, p. 297</ref>

==French Revolutionary Wars==
With the [[Peace of Versailles]] in 1783, the war ended and Inman was placed on half-pay in reserve, suffering from poor health caused by his ordeal on ''Hector''. Retiring to his father's house in Somerset, Inman was not employed again until 1790, when the [[Spanish Armament]] provoked a rapid expansion of the Navy.<ref name="JC298">Campbell, p. 298</ref> He was initially commissioned into the frigate [[HMS Latona (1781)|HMS ''Latona'']] under Captain [[Sir Albemarle Bertie, 1st Baronet|Albemarle Bertie]], but in the aftermath of the emergency Inman was given command of the 14-gun [[cutter (ship)|cutter]] [[HMS Pygmy|HMS ''Pygmy'']], stationed on the [[Isle of Man]]. He also married the daughter of Commander Thomas Dalby in 1791; the couple would have a son and a daughter.<ref name="NT206"/> With the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in 1793, Inman was transferred to Lord Hood's flagship [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']] in the [[Mediterranean]], receiving a promotion to commander on 11 September. Serving during the [[Siege of Toulon]], Inman assisted in the removal of captured French ships from [[Toulon]] harbour and as a reward was promoted to [[post captain]] on 9 October and given command of the newly captured [[HMS Aurore (1793)|HMS ''Aurore'']]. Stationed off [[Hy<U+00E8>res]], ''Aurore'' was heavily engaged with French Republican gun batteries and expended 20,000 [[roundshot|cannon balls]] in November and December.<ref name="JC298"/>

When Toulon fell to the Republicans on 18 December 1793, Inman was initially sent to [[Corsica]] and then tasked with carrying a large number of Republican [[prisoners of war]] to [[Malta]]. With an understrength crew, Inman had difficulty in controlling the prisoners, who deliberately holed the bottom of the ship during the voyage. On arriving at Malta, Inman anchored his leaking ship in deep water under the guns of the port's defensive batteries and then removed his entire crew, leaving instructions with the prisoners that they could either pump out the water repair the damage or drown when the ship sank. The prisoners repaired the ship and were taken into captivity on Malta.<ref name="NT206"/> Transferred from ''Aurore'', Inman spent a brief period on the frigate [[HMS San Fiorenzo|HMS ''San Fiorenzo'']] before returning to Britain in command of the [[fourth rate]] [[HMS Romney (1762)|HMS ''Romney'']].<ref name="JC298"/> 

''Romney'' was paid off on arrival in Britain and Inman returned to the reserve until 1796, when he was made temporary captain of [[HMS Lion (1777)|HMS ''Lion'']] and then took command of the frigate [[HMS Espion|HMS ''Espion'']]. Ordered to sail for the [[River Clyde]], Inman set sail with his family on board but ''Espion'', an old ship in a poor state of repair, was struck by a gale in the [[English Channel]] and was almost destroyed. Eventually reaching safety in [[Spithead]], ''Espion'' was reduced to the reserve until extensive repairs could be made and Inman was again placed on half-pay.<ref name="JC299">Campbell, p. 299</ref> He was reinstated in 1797 as temporary commander of the ship of the line [[HMS Belliqueux (1780)|HMS ''Belliqueux'']] in the immediate aftermath of the [[Nore Mutiny]]. ''Belliqueux'' had been heavily involved in the uprising: three members of the crew were under sentence of death and six others facing severe punishment for their part in the revolt. Inman was consequently afraid for his life and for the next six months slept with three loaded pistols beside him.<ref name="NT206"/> ''Belliqueux'' was assigned to the blockade of the French Atlantic seaport of [[Brest, France|Brest]] and Inman continued to perform this service after he was moved to [[HMS Ramillies|HMS ''Ramillies'']] during 1798, in which he participated in the chase that eventually lead to the capture of [[French ship Hercule (1798)|''Hercule'']].<ref name="WJ2:107">James, Vol. 2, p. 107</ref> He was subsequently posted to the frigate [[HMS Andromeda (1784)|HMS ''Andromeda'']] in early 1799.<ref name="JC299"/>

===''D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9>e'' and Copenhagen===
[[Image:Battle of Copenhagen (1801).jpg|thumb|right|Battle of Copenhagen. ''D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9>e'' can be seen at the Southern extremity of the Danish line.]]
On 2 August 1799, Inman seized the neutral merchant ship ''Vrienden'' carrying a cargo of hemp. Although the vessel's legal state was uncertain, no merchant claimed its cargo and in 1802 she was condemned and sold for over 247 ''[[Pound sterling|l.]]''<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=15543|startpage=1361|date=21 December 1802|accessyear=2009|accessdaymonth=19 June}}</ref> In November 1799, ''Andromeda'' was attached to the force that evacuated the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]]'s army following the failure of the [[Anglo-Russian Invasion of Holland|Expedition to Holland]] and he remained in the region, observing movements off the [[Elbe]].<ref name="NT207">Tracy, p. 207</ref>  ''Andromeda'' also participated in the [[Raid on Dunkirk (1800)|Raid on Dunkirk]] on 7 July 1800, when four French frigates were attacked by a squadron of British ships in [[Dunkirk]] harbour. Although an assault with fireships failed, the French frigate [[HMS D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9>e (1800)|''D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9>e'']] was captured by [[HMS Dart|HMS ''Dart'']].<ref name="WJ3:42">James, Vol. 3, p. 42</ref> Inman, following in the cutter ''Vigilant'' with thirty volunteers from ''Andromeda''. Under fire from all sides, Inman successfully boarded the French ship following her surrender and brought her out of the harbour, sending the crew ashore on [[parole]] rather than detach men to guard them. ''D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9>e'' was brought back to Britain and commissioned into the Royal Navy, Inman taking command of the new frigate.<ref name="WJ3:43">James, Vol. 3, p. 43</ref>

In 1801, ''D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9>e'' was attached to the fleet gathering at [[Yarmouth]] under [[Hyde Parker (admiral)|Sir Hyde Parker]] and [[Horatio Nelson|Lord Nelson]] for service in the [[Baltic Sea]] against the [[Second League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]].<ref name="JC300">Campbell, p. 300</ref> Sailing for [[Denmark]] in March, the fleet anchored off [[Copenhagen]] and on 1 April a squadron under Nelson closed with the Danish fleet, which was anchored in a [[line of battle]] protecting the harbour. ''D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9>e'' was ordered to operate at the Southern end of the Danish line, engaging shore batteries and nearby ships while their attention was focused on the main British battleline.<ref name="WJ3:70">James, Vol. 3, p. 70</ref> When the battle began at 10:00 on 2 April, Inman engaged the [[Danish ship Provesteen|''Provesteen'']], which was firing on the 50-gun [[HMS Isis (1774)|HMS ''Isis'']]. ''D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9>e'' succeeded in inflicting considerable damage on the Danish ship and drew some fire away from the battered ''Isis''. Once ''Provesteen'' had been abandoned by her Danish crew ''D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9>e'' was engaged with a number of Danish shore batteries, but due to poor aim of the Danish gunners, who fired over the frigate throughout the engagement, she was not badly damaged and suffered only four men wounded in the battle.<ref name="JC300"/> At 14:00 Danish fire slackened and shortly afterwards Nelson began to withdraw his ships out of range of the Danes. A number of his ships of the line grounded on the complicated shoals in the region and when ''D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9>e'' came to the assistance of [[HMS Bellona (1760)|HMS ''Bellona'']] she too became stuck. ''Bellona'' was hauled off by ''Isis'' shortly afterwards, but ''D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9>e'' was forced to remain on the sandbank for two days until boats from the squadron could be spared to drag her free.<ref name="NT207"/>

==Napoleonic Wars==
At the Peace of Amiens, ''D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9>e'' remained in service with orders to sail for the West Indies. Inman, whose health was beginning to suffer, resigned command and returned to his family on half-pay until the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803, when he was given the 64-gun ship of the line [[HMS Utrecht (1799)|HMS ''Utrecht'']].<ref name="JC301">Campbell, p. 301</ref> In 1804 he moved from ''Utrecht'' to the 74-gun [[HMS Triumph (1764)|HMS ''Triumph'']] and in February 1805 was attached to the fleet under [[Robert Calder|Sir Robert Calder]] stationed off [[Cape Finisterre]] during the [[Trafalgar campaign]]. At 11:00 on 22 July, Calder sighted the French and Spanish fleet under Vice-Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] emerging from the fog off [[Ferrol]] [[Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)|and attacked]], ''Triumph'' third in line behind [[HMS Hero (1803)|HMS ''Hero'']] and [[HMS Ajax (1798)|HMS ''Ajax'']].<ref name="WJ4:3">James, Vol. 4, p. 3</ref> The battle lines [[jibe|tacked]] and closed with one another, beginning a general action at 18:00, eventually separating at 21:30. ''Triumph'' was heavily engaged in the melee, in which two Spanish ships were captured, and suffered severe damage although light casualties of five killed and six wounded.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=15829|startpage=982|date=31 July 1805|accessyear=2009|accessdaymonth=19 June}}</ref> On 26 July, Inman was briefly detached from the fleet to chase away the French frigate [[HMS Didon (1805)|''Didon'']] before returning to her station in the battle line, but the action was not resumed, Calder ordering the fleet to return to Britain.<ref name="WJ4:8">James, Vol. 4, p. 8</ref> In the aftermath of the battle, Calder faced a court martial for his failure to resume the engagement and Inman was called to give evidence: when questioned as to why he had not informed Calder about the damage to his ship, Inman replied "I did not think that a proper time to trouble the admiral with my complaints".<ref name="NT207"/>

Inman's health had suffered during his long career at sea, and although he returned to sea in December 1805 aboard ''Triumph'' during the [[Atlantic campaign of 1806]] as part of the squadron under Rear-Admiral [[Richard John Strachan|Sir Richard Strachan]], his ill-health forced his replacement by [[Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Hardy]] in May.<ref name="WJ4:186">James, Vol. 4, p. 186</ref> Returning to his family ashore, Inman was initially given command of the sea fencibles at [[King's Lynn]] before he was made Admiralty commissioner at [[Madras]] by [[Henry Phipps, 3rd Baron Mulgrave|Lord Mulgrave]] in 1809. The journey to [[India]] broke his health completely and he died on 15 July 1809, just ten days after arriving in Madras.<ref name="JC302">Campbell, p. 302</ref>
