==Powers==
The Indiana Secretary of State is a constitutional office in the executive branch of the [[Government of Indiana]]. The constitution delegates power to oversee state elections by registering candidates, creating ballots, and certifying winners. Additionally all campaign financing information is also reported to the secretary who ensures it is compliant with state laws. This is accomplished through the Indiana Election Commission which is headed by the secretary who must personally sign off on all decisions. In cases of contested election, the Secretary of state is also the head of the State Recount Commission which has final authority in certifying elections.<ref name = ic15>Indiana Chamber, p. 15</ref>

The [[Indiana General Assembly]] has granted the secretary additional statutory powers to maintain the state's registry of [[notary|notaries]], overseeing the state's criminal records, and managing the statewide human resources and payroll for the entire state government. The secretary oversees all these tasks as the head of the [[Indiana Department of Administration]] which has a several hundred member staff which is hired through the state [[merit system]], denying the secretary a significant number of [[patronage]] position under his control.<ref name = ic14/>

The Indiana Securities Division is placed under the leadership of the secretary. The division is statutory and is responsible for enforcing regulations on the purchase, sale, and trade of all security investments in the state. The division is responsible for granting operating licenses to collection agencies who wish to collect debts within the state. The division investigates violations of the state securities laws, can levy fines on law violators, and can request the [[Indiana Attorney General]] peruse criminal charges. As of 2007, the division regulated over 1,000 trading firms and their nearly 40,000 agents.<ref name = ic15/>

The secretary also heads the statutory Division of Business Services. The division is responsible for maintaining the records of all corporations operating within Indiana, which in 2007 amounted to over 250,000 active and inactive corporations. Non-profit businesses, [[LLC|limited liability companies]], and [[LLP|limited liability partnerships]] also are required to register with the division. The division also approves [[trademark]]s and service marks for state companies. The division also maintains Indiana's Uniform Commercial Code which documents the assets and finances of businesses that fall under jurisdiction of the code. In 2007, approximately one million records were kept in accordance with the code.<ref>Indiana Code, p. 16</ref>
