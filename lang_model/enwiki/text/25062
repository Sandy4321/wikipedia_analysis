'''Walkden railway station''' is one of the principal stations that lie on the [[Atherton, Greater Manchester|Atherton]] line, between [[Wigan]] and [[Manchester]]. The station is located 13 km (8<U+00BC> miles) west of [[Manchester Victoria]] with regular [[Northern Rail]] services to these towns as well as [[Salford]], [[Swinton, Greater Manchester|Swinton]] and [[Hindley, Greater Manchester|Hindley]].

One of the more popular stations on the line (according to Strategic Rail Authority figures), the station was formerly known as '''''"Walkden High Level"''''' to differentiate it from Walkden Low Level station (on the line from Manchester Exchange to Bolton Great Moor Street, which was closed to passengers in 1954). Latest figures indicate that over 150,000 passengers use the station annually.[http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/xls/station_usage_2005-06.xls]

In February 2007 the [http://www.walkdenstation.org.uk Friends of Walkden Station] community volunteer group was founded to campaign for improvements to the station's facilities and services.
