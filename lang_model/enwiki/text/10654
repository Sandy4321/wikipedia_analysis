'''''U2 3D''''' is a 2008 [[concert film]] by [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[rock music|rock]] band [[U2]], featuring footage from the band's 2006 [[Vertigo Tour]]. U2 [[art director]] Catherine Owens made her film directorial debut, with the help of co-director [[Mark Pellington]], to create the first live-action film shot, produced, and screened exclusively with both [[3-D film|3-D]] and [[digital cinema]] technology.<ref name="variety">{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117961225.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title=ShoWest gets peek at 'U2' |first=David S |last=Cohen |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2007-03-15 |accessdate=2004-04-07}}</ref>  Following the 1988 [[rockumentary]] ''[[Rattle and Hum]]'', it became U2's second theatrically released film.  Footage from nine concerts were shot, using as many as 18 cameras at a time, and were edited together to create an 85 minute film featuring a 14-song performance.

The project was created to experiment with a new type of 3-D film technology, released by 3ality Digital in 2003.  The film was praised for its 3-D technology and innovation. After its preview screening at the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival]], the film held its premiere at the [[2008 Sundance Film Festival]], and was later shown at over 600 theaters internationally following its wide release in February 2008.  It peaked at number 19 and brought in [[United States dollar|US$]]16 million after the first five months, surpassing the film's budget.  The band stated that the film was not created to make a profit, but rather to share the new 3-D technology with a mainstream audience.  It received mostly positive reviews, with many critics stating that viewing the 3-D effects in the film was actually better than going to a live concert.

== Production ==
=== Background ===

In 2003, 3-D film production company 3ality Digital released a new type of 3-D filming technology, created by [[film producer]] and 3ality founder Steve Schklair. The technology used [[motion control photography]] and real-time [[image processing]] to create a realistic 3-D experience without subjecting the viewer to [[motion sickness]], and was intended to be used as an inexpensive and effective way to film live events in 3-D, such as [[concert]]s and [[sport]]ing events.  With the help of 3ality executives David and John Modell, former owners of the [[Baltimore Ravens]] [[American football]] team, the 3-D technology was initially tested by shooting several American football games during the [[2003 NFL season]], including [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]]. The footage was shown to the [[National Football League]], with the hopes of creating an NFL-based 3-D [[IMAX]] film.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E4D91338F93AA15752C0A9629C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=A Film Team's Super Bowl Test |first=Seth |last=Schiesel |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=2004-01-29 |accessdate=2008-06-20}}</ref>  While waiting to hear from the league, 3ality executives Jon and David Shapiro proposed the idea of creating a 3-D concert film, after having produced the 2-D IMAX concert film ''All Access'' in 2001.<ref name="jambands"/>  While ''All Access'' featured performances of several artists, the Shapiros felt it would be best to create a 3-D film focused on one live act, and they chose their favorite live band, U2.<ref name="pressnotes"/>

David Modell previously worked briefly with U2 in 1997, after he was interested in featuring [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] video technology at [[M&T Bank Stadium|Ravens Stadium at Camden Yards]].  At the time, the first and only LED video screen in existence was being used by U2 on their [[PopMart Tour]], so Modell toured with the band on and off for a period of six months to learn about the technology.  During that time, he became friendly with the band's [[art director]], Catherine Owens, who had worked with the band since their [[Zoo TV Tour]] in 1992.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&jump=story&id=1061&articleid=VR1117965270&cs=1 |title=Dawn of a beautiful day for 3D? |first=David S |last=Cohen |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |date=2007-05-18 |accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref>

Peter Shapiro contacted Owens in 2004 to propose the project to U2.  Owens became interested in the project after viewing test footage of the 3-D technology, and expressed interested in [[film director|directing]], despite not having any previous filming experience.<ref name="joblo" />  Before the band agreed, test footage was filmed with a single 3-D camera at one of U2's [[Vertigo Tour]] concerts in [[Anaheim, California]].<ref name="jambands">{{cite news |url=http://www.jambands.com/Features/content_2008_01_23.06.phtml |title=U2 3D: The Next Dimension, An Interview with Producer Pete Shapiro |first=Jefferson |last=Waful |date=2008-01-23 |accessdate=2008-02-08 |work=Jambands.com |publisher=[[Relix]]}}</ref>  As U2 had previously experimented with video technology in the past, the band was interested in the 3-D film project as a technological experiment, rather than to make a profit.<ref name="joblo"/> Once the footage from Anaheim was released, the band agreed to participate in the project, and officially signed on in mid-2005.<ref name="wicki">{{cite web| url=http://www.u2swisshome.com/shared/e/owicki.htm | title=Olivier Wicki: Interview |work=U2 Swiss Home |accessdate=2008-02-08}}</ref>

=== Filming ===

The producers originally wanted to shoot the film in and around [[Los Angeles, California]], where 3ality Digital's headquarters were located.<ref name="jambands"/>  However, [[Bono]] insisted on shooting the film at the concerts in [[Latin America]] because he felt that the passion of the audiences in those countries best resembled the passion of the audiences in the band's home of Ireland.<ref name="joblo" /> U2 toured Latin America on the fourth leg of the Vertigo Tour in February and March 2006, with eight shows in five cities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u2gigs.com/tour227.html |title=U2 Vertigo Tour 4th leg: Latin America |last=M<U+00FC>hlbradt |first=Matthias |coauthors=Stieglmayer, Martin |work=U2gigs.com |accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref> The fourth leg of the tour featured eight shows, all of which were filmed for the movie, minus the first show in [[Monterrey]], [[Mexico]].  The film's production featured the first ever 3-D multicamera live shoot, and was shot using every digital 3-D camera and recording deck in existence at the time.<ref name="jambands"/><ref name="bluerock">{{cite news |url=http://digitalproducer.digitalmedianet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=139520 |title=Bluerock announces U2 3D Preview Screening at Cannes|date=2007-05-14|accessdate=2007-05-15|publisher=DMN Newswire}}</ref>  The digital 3-D equipment included a total of 18 [[Sony]] [[CineAlta]] F950 cameras, which captured video onto [[HDCAM#HDCAM SR|HDCAM SR]] recording decks.<ref name="sony">{{cite press release |url=http://www.sony.co.uk/biz/view/ShowContent.action?site=biz_en_GB&contentId=1179907719529&sectiontype=S2S+News |title=U2 concerts captured in 3D with CineAlta |date=2007-06-11 |publisher=[[Sony]] |accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref>   Nine camera setups were built with two cameras each, acting as a pair of [[eye]]s to help create a 3-D effect during post-production.

[[Sound recording and reproduction|Audio recordings]] of the band were recorded using microphones placed on the main stage, and around the two [[B-stage]]s, where the band would perform during several songs. To record the audience, microphones were placed in various locations depending on the type of venue in which the band was performing. Originally, 96 different audio channels were used for recording.  Audience microphones were subsequently added, extending the total to 110 channels.<ref name="mix">{{cite news |url=http://mixonline.com/post/features/audio_article_7/ |title=U2 3D: Reality Rock 'n' Roll |publisher=[[Penton Media]] |work=[[Mix (magazine)|Mix]] |first=Matt |last=Hurwitz |date=2008-03-01 |accessdate=2008-04-27 |page=1}}</ref>

[[Image:U2 3D Sao Paulo.jpg|thumb|U2 perform "[[Pride (In the Name of Love)]]" in [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]], while being filmed for ''U2 3D'']]

Each show was filmed without [[storyboard]]s or [[shooting script]]s to capture realistic, unstaged footage of the band's performances.  The shoots were clearly planned so that the filming would not interfere with the band's performance or the audience's view.  Since several different shows would be edited together to create one performance, the band was required to wear the same clothes each night to eliminate [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] errors in the final cut of the film.<ref name="movies.ie">{{cite web |url=http://www.movies.ie/html/article.aspx?articleid=1895 |title=Interview with 'U2 3D' director Catherine Owens |work=Movies.ie |accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref>  Shooting began in February 2006 at [[Estadio Azteca]] in [[Mexico City]], where two shows were filmed exclusively to capture [[medium shot]]s.  At the following two shows, at [[Est<U+00E1>dio do Morumbi]] in [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]], [[Brazil]], two cameras setups were used to capture [[long shot]]s.  The band's next concert, which was held at [[Estadio Nacional de Chile]] in [[Santiago, Chile]], featured only a single overhead camera setup, used to capture footage of drummer [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]]  After filming five shows, the crew needed to capture [[close-up]] shots, so a "phantom shoot" took place,<ref name="rte">{{cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2008/0222/catherineowensinterview.html |title=Catherine Owens (U23D director) interview |publisher=[[Radio Telef<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann]] |work=RT<U+00C9>.ie Entertainment |date=2008-02-22 |accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> where U2 played a 10-song set at [[River Plate Stadium]] in [[Buenos Aires]], which was filmed without an audience.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.philly.com/dailynews/columnists/jonathan_takiff/20080123_Jonathan_Takiff__U2_3D_may_send_TV_viewers_to_new_sets.html |title='U2 3D' may send TV viewers to new sets |first=Jonathan |last=Takiff |publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Holdings]] |work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] |date=2008-01-23 |accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref>  During the following two nights in Buenos Aires, the concerts were filmed with all nine pairs of cameras, capturing shots of the band from the [[B-stage]]s.<ref name="movies.ie" /> The Buenos Aires shoot was the largest of the project, and required a crew of 140 people.<ref name="pressnotes" /> The final shoot of the project took place in November 2006, where two shows were filmed at the [[Telstra Dome]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] on the fifth leg of the tour, mostly to capture extra footage of the audience.<ref name="wicki" />

=== Editing ===

[[Film editing|Editor]] Olivier Wicki was chosen to work on the post-production of the film, after previously working on U2's "[[Original of the Species]]" music video.  Wicki worked closely with director Catherine Owens during the post-production process, developing ideas for each track before editing the footage.<ref name="wicki"/> Over 100 hours of footage was filmed featuring performances of 26 different songs.<ref name="canada"/>  To make the film appealing to a mainstream audience, Owens decided that only 14<U+2013>15 songs out of 26 would appear in the final cut, most of which would be U2's most popular songs.<ref name="variety"/> When selecting songs for the film, the crew had to ensure that the performances of each track fit in with one another. For example, the band wanted their performances of "[[Mysterious Ways (song)|Mysterious Ways]]" and "[[Until the End of the World (song)|Until the End of the World]]" to be included, however they were left out since they felt that those songs were out of place with the rest of the film.<ref name="canada">{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/culture/story.html?id=396cc5b7-0419-4608-9ea0-290aaa7c333d&k=89101# |title=U2 film two years in making |first=Sandra |last=Sperounes |publisher=[[Canwest]] |work=[[Edmonton Journal]] |date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref>

Eventually, 14 of the 26 songs were chosen to be in the final cut, and the footage was edited in 2-D using [[Avid Technology|Avid]] editing systems, in [[New York City]] over a period of eight months.<ref name="avid">{{cite press release |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS152328+17-Jan-2008+BW20080117?sp=true |title=2008 Sundance Film Festival to Feature Works of Several Avid Customers |date=2008-01-17 |accessdate=2008-04-18 |publisher=[[Business Wire]]}}</ref><ref name="dex">{{cite press release |url=http://www.dexigner.com/design_news/bluerock-editor-cuts-u2-3d.html |title=Bluerock Editor Cuts U2 3D |date=2008-01-22 |accessdate=2008-04-18 |publisher=Dexinger}}</ref>   Video post-production continued in [[Burbank, California]] at 3ality Digital's 20,000 [[square foot]] (1900 [[square metre]]) 3-D production facility, which had just recently opened prior to the completion of the filming. Wicki worked with 3ality Digital to create the film's 3-D and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects.<ref name="dex"/>  Footage was edited into 3-D using software that was created by [[software developer|developers]] at the same time the film was being shot.<ref name="today"/>  Many of the scenes featuring several band members were created by layering several frames of footage on top of one another, with as many as five frames layered together at a time.  Because the film was shot in a super [[image resolution]] of [[high-definition video]], each frame of the film used nearly 20 [[megabyte]]s of data, and the entire film used almost a [[petabyte]] (10<sup>15</sup> [[byte]]s) of data on the 3ality's servers.<ref name="wired"/>   The 3-D editing process ended up taking much longer than Owens had expected, and caused the film to go over budget.<ref name="today"/> The entire video editing process took 17 months, and the final film was cut to a length of 85 minutes<U+2014>seven minutes short of its originally announced run time of 92 minutes.<ref name="joblo">{{cite news |url=http://www.joblo.com/interview-u2-3d-director |first=Jenny |last=Karakaya |title=INT: U2 3D director |date=2007-05-30|accessdate=2007-10-15|publisher=[[JoBlo.com]]}}</ref>

[[Audio editing|Audio editor]] Carl Glanville worked on the film's soundtrack with recordist Robbie Adams at Effanel Music in New York City.  Using the video footage compiled into  files by Wicki, which was then given to [[audio editing|audio editor]] Carl Glanville to compile the soundtrack for the film.<ref name="wicki"/>  Because of the nature of the shoots, the audio post-production proved to be very difficult for both Adams and Glanville.  While editors typically select the best performance of each song when editing live concert footage, this was not possible since footage from only one to two cameras angles were captured at most of the shows.<ref name="mix"/>  In addition, the lyrics and music from the songs performances each night differed slightly, and film's edited video footage featured 10- to 20-second-long shots, as opposed to quicker cuts usually found in concert films.  All audio and video footage used in the film was recorded live by the band in concert, and no [[overdubbing]] was used in post-production.<ref name="wired"/>  Editing began with Adams constructing [[playlist]]s of the recordings using [[Pro Tools]] software, while Glanville worked on the [[audio mixing]]. The video footage was compiled onto [[QuickTime]] and [[Open Media Framework Interchange|Open Media Framework]] files, which Glanville used to edit synchronize footage together.  To avoid [[lip sync]] and instrumental sync issues, the editors had to use the exact audio that was recorded during each shot.  Mixing the vocals required Glanville to layer the audio recorded from the stage microphones with the audience microphones, and add a short delay in between the two to compensate for any [[Echo (phenomenon)|echos]] or [[Delay (audio effect)|delays]] that occurred in the venue.<ref name="mix2">{{cite news |url=http://mixonline.com/post/features/audio_article_7/index1.html |title=U2 3D: Reality Rock 'n' Roll |publisher=[[Penton Media]] |work=[[Mix (magazine)|Mix]] |first=Matt |last=Hurwitz |date=2008-03-01 |accessdate=2008-04-27 |page=2}}</ref>
