'''Sidney Charles Bartholemew (Ben) Gascoigne''' (11 November 1915 <U+2013> 25 March 2010) was an Australian [[optical astronomy|optical astronomer]], an expert in [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]], and played a leading role in the design and commissioning of Australia's [[Anglo-Australian Telescope|largest optical telescope]], one of the world's most important astronomical facilities. Born in [[Napier, New Zealand]], Gascoigne trained in Auckland and at the [[University of Bristol]], before moving to Australia during World War II to work at the [[Mount Stromlo Observatory|Commonwealth Solar Observatory]] at [[Mount Stromlo]] in [[Canberra]]. He became skillful in the design and manufacture of [[optics|optical devices]] such as telescope elements. 

Following the war, Gascoigne and astronomer Gerald Kron used newly modernised telescopes at Mount Stromlo to determine that the distance between [[Milky Way|our galaxy]] and the [[Magellanic Cloud]] dwarf galaxies had been underestimated by a factor of two. Because this measurement was used to calibrate other distances in astronomy, the result effectively doubled the estimated size of the universe. They also found that star formation in the Magellanic Clouds had occurred more recently than in the Milky Way; this overturned the prevailing view that both had evolved in parallel. A major figure at [[Mount Stromlo Observatory]], Gascoigne helped it develop from a solar observatory to a centre of stellar and galactic research, and was instrumental in the creation of its field observatory in northern New South Wales, [[Siding Spring Observatory]].
When the British and Australian governments agreed to jointly build the [[Anglo-Australian Telescope]] at Siding Spring, Gascoigne was involved from its initial conception and throughout its lengthy commissioning, taking its [[First light (astronomy)|first photograph]]. Gascoigne was made an [[Officer of the Order of Australia]] for his contributions to astronomy and to the Anglo-Australian Telescope.

Gascoigne and his wife, artist [[Rosalie Gascoigne]], had three children. After he retired, Gascoigne wrote several works on Australian astronomical history. He acted as Rosalie's curator, photographer, and assistant, using his technical skills to make her artworks resilient for public display.

==Early life==
Ben Gascoigne's parents met and married in [[Levin, New Zealand]], just before the First World War.

Although Gascoigne had always intended to study mathematics at Cambridge, an event occurred that significantly shaped his career. In 1931,{{#tag:ref|Gascoigne incorrectly gives a date of 1928 in his interview with Crompton.|group=notes}} an [[1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake|earthquake in New Zealand]] killed Michael Hiatt Baker, a young traveller from Bristol, and his parents established a postgraduate scholarship in his memory, for study at the [[University of Bristol]],<ref name=Crompton/><ref>{{cite book|last=University of London Institute of Education|coauthors= Columbia University Teachers College|title=The Year book of education|year=1934|page=327|publisher=Evans Bros.}}</ref> which Gascoigne won and took up in 1938.<ref name=Freeman/> During his thesis studies at Bristol, Gascoigne developed a [[diffraction]] theory of the [[Amateur telescope making#Foucault test|Foucault test]] that is used for evaluating the shape of large telescope mirrors.<ref name=Crompton/> He completed his doctorate in physics in 1941, but by then war had broken out in Europe, and he had already returned to New Zealand on the last available ship.<ref name=Crompton/><ref name=Freeman/><ref name="McCarthy"/>

==War service 1940<U+2013>1945==
Returning to a job in the physics department at Auckland, Gascoigne worked on military [[optics]], developing [[gun sight]]s and [[rangefinder]]s,<ref name=Crompton/> although he did not remain there for long. Richard van der Reit Woolley, director of the Commonwealth Solar Observatory in [[Canberra]] (now [[Mount Stromlo Observatory]]), sought out Gascoigne because his "experience in optical work [was] unique" and  Gascoigne was "trained in a way that no one else in Australia has been qualified".<ref>Frame & Faulkner, p. 81</ref><ref name="Giants">{{cite web|url=http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/exhib/omp/people/gascoigne.htm|title=Sydney Charles 'Ben' Gascoigne|year=1998|work=The giant's eye: The optical munitions exhibition|publisher=Australian Science Archives Project|accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref> When in 1941 Gascoigne was offered a research fellowship by Woolley, he moved to Canberra.<ref name=Freeman/> The Solar Observatory staff had similar responsibilities to those Gascoigne had held in New Zealand. His first task was to design an anti-aircraft gun sight, and he was also involved in a range of other military optical projects. In 1944, the Melbourne Observatory, home to the Commonwealth Time Service, was closed. Gascoigne reestablished the Time Service at Mount Stromlo, using two [[Shortt-Synchronome clock]]s and astronomical observing equipment that he and his colleagues adapted; the Time Service remained at Mount Stromlo until 1968.<ref>Frame & Faulkner, p. 98</ref> The knowledge and experience Gascoigne gained during the war proved valuable. He was at the only facility in Australia where optical work could be done, from design and manufacture to assembly and testing. Gascoigne developed a wide range of skills and "finished up quite practical, especially with a screwdriver."<ref name=Crompton/>

A decade after Gascoigne  first met Rosalie in New Zealand, she travelled to Canberra, and on 9&nbsp;January 1943 they were married. Their first son, Martin, was born in November, and their second, Thomas, was born in 1945.<ref name="NGV">{{cite web|url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/media/mediaKitArticles/105/display|title=Media Kit Article: Rosalie Gascoigne{{ndash}} The Artist |work=NGV Media|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref>

==Mount Stromlo==
Following the end of the war Woolley redirected the Commonwealth Observatory from solar research towards the study of stars and galaxies. It took time to get the old and unused telescopes back up to working condition: they had to be overhauled and refurbished, and in one case rebuilt from scrap.<ref name=Crompton/> Woolley got funding approval from the [[Ben Chifley|Prime Minister]] for construction of a 74-inch telescope, but it would not be finished for years. Gascoigne began to work in the nascent field of photoelectric [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]], using electrical devices to measure the brightness of stars more accurately than had been possible using photographic techniques. In 1951, with equipment brought from California's [[Lick Observatory]], he observed [[Cepheid variable]] stars, which are used to [[Cosmic distance ladder|measure astronomical distances]].<ref name=Freeman/><ref name=Cannon/> Granted nine months of observing time on the Observatory's Reynolds 30-inch [[reflector telescope]] <U+2013> an extraordinary opportunity <U+2013> Gascoigne, Gerald Kron and others surveyed Cepheid stars in both the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]] and, later, the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]. They also examined the colours of [[star cluster]]s in the Small Cloud. 
The research produced remarkable results: "it meant that the Magellanic Clouds were twice as far away as was previously thought, and if then the baseline is twice as long, the size of the universe is doubled."<ref name="Crompton"/> It also showed that star formation in the Magellanic Clouds had occurred more recently than in the [[Milky Way]]. The results overturned the prevailing view that our galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds had evolved in parallel.<ref name="Haynes168">Haynes ''et al.'', p. 168</ref> Gascoigne said of his work:
{{quote|When suddenly all this dropped into place, after I had been working away at it for quite a while, measuring more Cepheids in our own Galaxy and some in the Large Cloud, the feeling of triumph, the great feeling that I had really done something, was wonderful.

In 1949, the Gascoignes' third child, daughter Hester, was born.<ref name=NGV/> Like many Observatory personnel, the Gascoignes lived in a staff residence on [[Mount Stromlo]], which was a long difficult trip away from Canberra. It was cold and lonely, particularly for Rosalie, but they enjoyed the outdoors, and the landscape inspired Rosalie's creativity and later her artistic career.<ref name=Crompton/><ref name="Hughes">{{cite web|url=http://www.australianbiography.gov.au/subjects/gascoigne/script.html|title=TV Script|last=Hughes|first=Robin|year=1999|work=Rosalie Gascoigne|publisher=Film Australia & National Library of Australia|accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref> In 1960 they relocated to [[Deakin, Canberra|Deakin]] in suburban Canberra,<ref name=NGV/> and in the late 1960s they moved to another suburb, [[Pearce, Canberra|Pearce]].<ref name=Hossack/>

In 1957, administrative responsibility for the Commonwealth Observatory was transferred from the Australian Government's Department of the Interior to the [[Australian National University]] (ANU), a move supported by both its director, Richard Woolley, and Gascoigne.<ref>Bhathal, p. 50</ref> This was an era of significant change at Mount Stromlo: in January 1956 Woolley had resigned as director of Mount Stromlo to take up a position as [[Astronomer Royal]] and director of the [[Royal Observatory Greenwich]].<ref>Haynes ''et al.'', p. 171</ref> He was replaced by [[Bart Bok]], whom Gascoigne liked and under whose directorship he played a significant role.<ref>Bhathal, p. 52</ref> Also in 1957, the Mount Stromlo team began searching for a new field observatory site, due to the increased [[light pollution]] from Canberra's growth.<ref>Frame & Faulkner, p. 140</ref> The search was vigorously promoted by Bok, and after an examination of 20 possible locations, two were shortlisted: Mount Bingar, near [[Griffith, New South Wales]], and Siding Spring, near [[Coonabarabran, New South Wales]].<ref>Haynes ''et al.'', p. 175</ref> Gascoigne was one of a group of scientists who visited Siding Spring Mountain as part of the search,<ref>Frame & Faulkner, p. 141</ref> and he was one of those who advocated this choice:<ref name="Hyland">{{cite journal|last=Hyland|first=A.

{{quote|text=We had to climb the last bit on foot ... [I was] the first astronomer to set foot on Siding Spring.

It really is a wonderful place to be.<ref name="Crompton"/>}}
In 1962, Siding Spring was selected, and by 1967 [[Siding Spring Observatory]] was fully operational.<ref>Gascoigne ''et al.'', p. 49</ref> 

At the end of Woolley's directorship, the 74-inch telescope he had initiated finally came online. Gascoigne, looking for a new research project and keen to use the new telescope, took up the study of [[globular cluster]]s, compact groups of tens of thousands of ancient stars of similar age. With a new design of [[photometer]], he was able to measure the exceptionally faint stars in these clusters. Gascoigne determined that the clusters in the Magellanic Clouds were both young and old, and had quite different characteristics to those in the Milky Way: this information was important for modelling the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|evolution of galaxies]].<ref>Haynes ''et al.'', pp. 168, 187</ref>

In 1963, Gascoigne developed a device, known as an optical corrector plate, which allowed [[field of view|wide field]] photography on the new 40-inch telescope at Siding Spring. Such corrector plates were subsequently used on many telescopes and became known as Gascoigne correctors.<ref name=Freeman/> During this period he was also active in supporting the establishment of a national research organisation for astronomers, the [[Astronomical Society of Australia]]. It held its first meeting in 1966, and Gascoigne was made its first vice-president.<ref>Frame & Faulkner, p. 163</ref>

When Bok retired as Stromlo's director in early 1966, Gascoigne became acting director for three months until the arrival of Bok's replacement, American astronomer [[Olin J. Eggen]].<ref>Bhathal, p. 55</ref> Eggen was an enormously productive scientist,<ref>Frame & Faulkner, p. 164</ref> but was "enigmatic", "somewhat gruff" and selective in the friendships he formed.<ref>Frame & Faulkner, p. 161</ref> Although Eggen and Gascoigne had previously collaborated on research projects, when Eggen arrived to take up the post, he and Gascoigne did not get on well. Gascoigne said of Eggen: "he made it clear I had no further part in running the Observatory. I was given no information, saw no documents, attended no meetings, and was asked for no advice, not even in optical matters."<ref>Bhathal, pp. 52<U+2013>55</ref> However, Gascoigne was given a significant opportunity that became the focus of the remainder of his paid academic career: to help establish one of the world's largest optical telescopes, at Siding Spring.

==Anglo-Australian Telescope==
[[File:Aat.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A complex piece of cylindrical machinery rising several metres above the floor of a large enclosing dome|The Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding Springs Observatory near [[Coonabarabran]], which Gascoigne helped design and commission]]
In the early 1960s, the Australian and British governments proposed a partnership to build a joint optical telescope facility, and Gascoigne was among the experts involved.<ref>Gascoigne ''et al.'', p. 32</ref> Former Mount Stromlo director and now head of the Greenwich observatory, Richard Woolley, was prominent in supporting the project from the British end.<ref>Haynes ''et al.'', p. 170</ref>
In 1967, the two governments formally agreed to collaborate on the construction of a large telescope, to be known as the [[Anglo-Australian Telescope]] (AAT). Given the existing infrastructure of the ANU's Siding Spring Observatory, the site was readily agreed as the location for the AAT.<ref>Gascoigne ''et al'', p. 50</ref> Gascoigne was one of the four members of the Technical Committee established to guide the telescope's development.<ref>Frame & Faulkner, p. 175</ref> He provided leadership on the design and optics of the new telescope, and was made the chief commissioning astronomer in 1974.<ref name=Freeman/><ref name=Cannon/> 

A bitter struggle over the management and operation of the new facility went on for some years. The Australian National University and the director at Stromlo, Olin Eggen, wanted the telescope to be under the control of the University; other Australian astronomers and the British wanted it established independently.<ref>Gascoigne ''et al.'', pp. 125<U+2013>147</ref><ref>Frame & Faulkner, pp. 175<U+2013>178</ref> Gascoigne's co-authored history of the telescope states that "None of the eight Fellows of the Australian Academy of Science [Gascoigne was one of them] supported the ANU"<ref name="Gascoigne et al., p. 139">Gascoigne ''et al.'', p. 139</ref> and in 1973 the debate was resolved in favour of an independent structure, the [[Anglo-Australian Observatory]].<ref>Frame & Faulkner p. 177</ref> Gascoigne was the only Mount Stromlo employee who ended up working on the AAT for an extended period during its establishment phase: the Anglo-Australian Observatory could not offer [[tenure|academic tenure]] to match the conditions offered by the ANU.<ref name="Gascoigne et al., p. 139"/>

The work at Siding Spring was rewarding, but it could also be dangerous. During construction, Gascoigne constantly warned colleagues to take care on the elevated catwalks around the telescope. However, Gascoigne himself was almost killed when, while working one night around the telescope structure, he fell seven metres to the floor of the observatory, narrowly missing "a massive steel structure with long protruding bolts".<ref name=Crompton/><ref name=Freeman/><ref group="notes">The location inside the AAT dome is now known as "Gascoigne's Leap".</ref> He survived, and was the [[first light (astronomy)|first to take a photograph]] using the telescope, on 26<ref>Haynes ''et al.'', p. 394</ref> or 27&nbsp;April 1974.<ref>Gascoigne ''et al.'', p. 160</ref> Gascoigne was so pleased with the quality of the optics that he said he wanted a number describing the [[hyperboloid]] shape of the mirror (1.1717) engraved on his [[headstone]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Pockley|first=Peter|title=The telescope at Siding Spring|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=3 November 1974|url=http://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=Tp0pAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CuUDAAAAIBAJ&dq=ben%20gascoigne&pg=1192%2C1140860 |page=38|accessdate=17 May 2010}}</ref> The site quickly became one of the world's most important astronomical observatories<ref>Haynes ''et al.'', p. 176</ref> and was for many years home to world-leading [[astrophotography|astrophotographer]] [[David Malin]].<ref>Gascoigne ''et al.'', pp. 209<U+2013>210</ref><ref>Haynes ''et al.'', pp. 400<U+2013>401</ref> The successes of the AAT have been documented in annual reports by its Board,<ref>{{cite book|last=Anglo-Australian Observatory|first=|title=AAO Annual Report 1997-1998|url=http://www.aao.gov.au/annual/1998/|year=1998|publisher=Anglo-Australian Observatory|location=Sydney NSW|page=11}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Anglo-Australian Telescope Board|first=|title=Annual Report of the Anglo-Australian Telescope Board 1 July 2008 <U+2013> 30 June 2009|year=2008|publisher=Anglo-Australian Observatory|location=Eastwood NSW|url=http://www.aao.gov.au/annual/2009/ar091030.pdf |issn=1443-8550|page=46}}</ref> while a 2008 analysis of the [[impact factor|relative impacts]] of astronomical observing facilities placed the AAT in the top three, coming after only the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] and the [[W.

==Artist's assistant and historian==
By the middle of 1975, the Anglo-Australian Telescope was fully operational, and Gascoigne was offered a job with the new telescope, based in Sydney. However, by this time his wife was emerging as a significant artist who relied on the landscapes and materials [[Monaro (New South Wales)|around their home]] for her inspiration, so he decided to return to the Australian National University in Canberra and support her work.<ref name=Freeman/><ref name=Cannon/><ref>{{cite web|last=National Gallery of Victoria |title=Rosalie Gascoigne |work=The Ian Potter Centre NGV Australia|url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/rosaliegascoigne/ |accessdate=19 may 2010}}</ref> He retired a few years later, in 1980.<ref name=Freeman/> {{quote box|align=right|width=40%|quoted=1|fontsize=95%|quote=Never, ever, did I think that I would some day say to myself, 'who else in Australia would be entrusted to attack a wonderful work like this with a six-inch circular saw?'|source=Ben Gascoigne, on squaring up the panels of Rosalie's ''Monaro''<ref name=Crompton/>|salign=right}} Gascoigne completed a course in welding and became his wife's assistant, making "her assemblies of 'found objects' safer and more durable".

==Recognition and legacy==
Gascoigne was widely respected for his astronomical skills and his generous nature. English astronomer and writer [[Fred Hoyle|Sir Fred Hoyle]], at one time the Chairman of the AAT, gave Gascoigne considerable credit for the telescope's success,<ref>Bhathal, p. 14</ref> and astronomer Harry Minnett likewise credited him, together with [[Roderick Oliver Redman]], for the telescope's extremely good optics.<ref>Bhathal, p. 90</ref> Former AAT director [[Russell Cannon]] regarded Gascoigne as a world leader in his field, as well as being "a delightful man".<ref>Bhathal, p. 178</ref> Historian of astronomy Ragbir Bhathal considered Gascoigne to have been an important figure in Australian astronomy, responsible for substantial advances in the field.<ref>Bhathal, p. 15</ref>

In 1966, Gascoigne was elected a fellow of the [[Australian Academy of Science]].<ref name=Freeman/> He was made an Honorary Fellow of the Astronomical Society of Australia; became the first person to be elected as an Honorary Member of the Optical Society of Australia; and was the first Australian to be elected as an Associate of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]].<ref name="Crompton"/>
On 11&nbsp;June 1996, Gascoigne was made an [[Officer of the Order of Australia]] for his contributions to astronomy and to the AAT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=886158&search_type=quick&showInd=true|title=Gascoigne, Sidney Charles Bartholomew|work=Australian Honours database|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref> On 1&nbsp;January 2001, he was awarded the [[Centenary Medal]], for his service to society and to astronomy.<ref name="CentenaryMedal">{{cite web|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1127613&search_type=quick&showInd=true|title=Gascoigne, Sidney Charles|work=Australian Honours database|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=6&nbsp;May 2010}}</ref>
