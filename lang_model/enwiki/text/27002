The '''Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party''' (VUPP), informally known as '''Ulster Vanguard''', was a [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] political party which existed in [[Northern Ireland]] between 1973 and 1978. It was closely affiliated with several [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] [[paramilitary]] groups.

==Origins==
It had its roots in the '''Vanguard''' or '''Ulster Vanguard''' wing of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) who were opposed to the policies of the party's leader and last [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]], [[Brian Faulkner]]. The Ulster Vanguard movement was originally a political pressure group within the UUP. It was formed on  9 February 1972<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/uorgan.htm#uv Abstracts of Organisations - 'U'] Conflict Archive on the INternet</ref> and was led by [[William Craig (politician)|William Craig]] (former Minister of Home Affairs at [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont]]) with its deputy leaders [[Martin Smyth|Rev Martin Smyth]] and the former Stormont MP for Carrick, [[Austin Ardill|Captain Austin Ardill]].<ref>[http://www.election.demon.co.uk/stormont/biographies.html Northern Ireland Parliamentary Elections Results: Biographies] Election Demon</ref> At its first meeting in [[Lisburn]], on 13 February 1972, Craig made the first of a number of bellicose pronouncements, declaring "God help those who get in our way for we mean business."<ref>[http://www.galeuk.com/stormont/pdf/End%20of%20Stormont%20&%20imposition%20of%20direct%20rule%201972.pdf Craig's speech at Lisburn rally] Cengage Learning</ref>

After the suspension of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont Parliament]], Faulkner moved towards a policy of power-sharing with nationalist and non-sectarian politicians under the [[Sunningdale Agreement]]. In opposition to this many in the Ulster Unionists broke away and founded a separate Vanguard Party, with William Craig as the leader.

==Ideology==
Vanguard is usually considered to have been a right-wing party. In its earliest days it adopted the style associated with [[falangist]] parties with an honour guard, a common salute and a habit of wearing sashes. This led to it being characterised as [[Oswald Mosley|Mosleyite]]<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qps14mSlghcC&pg=PA263&lpg=PA263&dq=vanguard+unionist+party&source=web&ots=2i3PM1JGR5&sig=xcyvhUds4BUmw4PO8Cm0W8P5W4I&hl=en Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organisations, Barberis/McHugh/Tyldesley (2003) p263] Google Books</ref> or even neo-Nazi <ref name="books.google.co.uk">[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3q3wYR8gWusC&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=vanguard+unionist+party&source=web&ots=QmFErtot7o&sig=ElvGLfIFaYFGRS2QrCqruL7xRmY&hl=en Indispensible Traitors:Liberal Parties in settler conflicts by Thomas G. Mitchell, p89] Google Books</ref> with the Stormont MP [[Robert Dodd McConnell|William McConnell]] claiming that Vanguard rallies involved "a certain Hitlerian-type figure ... walking up and down the lines, inspecting his so-called storm-troopers."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=84&pageno=621&searchTerm=vanguard#bak-84-623 |title=The Stormont Papers <U+2013> Volume 84, p621 |publisher=Stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref>

Ulster Vanguard was intended to provide an umbrella organisation for various loyalist groups.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/recent/troubles/the_troubles_article_05.shtml The troubles article] BBC History</ref> 
It had close links with, and strong support from Loyalist paramilitary groups. Vanguard had its own paramilitary grouping called the Vanguard Service Corps (USC) whose main function seemed to be to provide escorts for Vanguard speakers attending rallies.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fnSfu-ivcSwC&pg=RA6-PA106&lpg=RA6-PA106&dq=vanguard+service+corps&source=web&ots=F_cgdI4eQU&sig=2L1MoTQAZxvc3JFx-781rCFmU9A&hl=en Political parties and terrorist groups by Leonard Weinberg, p106] Google Books</ref>

==Policies==
Vanguard strongly criticised the imposition of direct rule and in its booklet 'Ulster &ndash; A Nation' published in April 1972, it pledged "resistance to an undemocratic and un-British regime" and suggested the possibility of a Federal British Isles.<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/docs/vanguard72.htm CAIN: Ulster Vanguard (1972) Ulster - A Nation] Conflict Archive on the INternet</ref>

At the Darlington Conference in September 1972, held to discuss various constitutional options for Northern Ireland, they proposed the restoration of the Northern Ireland Parliament as a single chamber assembly with a committee system to ensure greater participation by all parties. Internal security responsibilities would be restored however there would be a [[Bill of Rights]] to safeguard the rights of minorities.<ref name="Mulholland">{{cite web |url=http://www.galeuk.com/stormont/pdf/End%20of%20Stormont%20&%20imposition%20of%20direct%20rule%201972.pdf |format=PDF|title=The End of Stormont and imposition of direct rule in 1972 |author=Dr Marc Mulholland, St Catherine<U+2019>s College, Oxford |publisher=Cengage Learning|accessdate=15 April 2008}}</ref>

It demanded the "extermination" of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] and a reversal of the reforms introduced by Brian Faulkner and his predecessor, and in a booklet published in late 1972 entitled 'Community of the British Isles' it even flirted with the idea of full independence for Northern Ireland albeit within a structure which would also include Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland.<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/docs/vanguard72a.htm CAIN: Ulster Vanguard (n.d.,1972?) Community of the British Isles] Conflict Archive on the INternet</ref> 

In late 1973 it rejected the idea of compulsory power sharing with Irish Nationalists and consequently refused invitations to take part in the conferences which led to the [[Sunningdale Agreement]].<ref>[http://www.uhb.fr/langues/cei/nicons74.htm White paper the Northern Ireland Constitution Part 2, 13] Universit<U+00E9> Rennes 2</ref>

In their 1974 Westminster manifesto, they called for the more mainstream Unionist option of either devolved government with full security responsibilities or full integration into the UK.<ref name="Mulholland" />

However there were occasions when it did not follow the same course as other right-wing or unionist parties. For example in [[United Kingdom referendum, 1975|the 1975 referendum]] on the United Kingdom's membership of the-then [[European Economic Community]], it campaigned for the United Kingdom to remain a member whilst the other Unionist parties campaigned for withdrawal.<ref>[http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/fref70s.htm The Referendums of 1973 and 1975] ARK - Access Research Knowledge</ref>

===Extra-Parliamentary activity===
Vanguard was firmly supportive of extra-parliamentary activity in the form of direct action in order to achieve its goals. On 26 January 1972, Craig announced plans to hold large rallies in major centres in Northern Ireland<ref name="galeuk.com">[http://www.galeuk.com/stormont/pdf/End%20of%20Stormont%20&%20imposition%20of%20direct%20rule%201972.pdf The end of Stormont and the imposition of direct rule] Cengage Learning</ref> The culmination was a large rally on 18 March 1972 in Belfast's Ormeau Park, attended by up to 60,000&nbsp;people, at which Craig said that "We must build up the dossiers on the men and women who are a menace to this country, because one day, ladies and gentlement, if the politicians fail, it will be our duty to liquidate the enemy".<ref>Boyd, Andrew, 1972, Brian Faulkner and the Crisis of Ulster Unionism, Anvil Books, Tralee, Republic of Ireland. p100</ref>

Following the suspension of Stormont and the imposition of direct rule in March 1972, Vanguard organised a general strike which affected power supplies, caused businesses to close and halted public transport.<ref>[http://falcon.arts.cornell.edu/dg78/100.3/documents/ira2.htm Northern Ireland <U+2013> History and Current Status of <U+201C>The Troubles<U+201D>]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref> About 190,000&nbsp;people participated and Vanguard members barricaded and took effective control of the town of [[Portadown]].<ref name="galeuk.com"/> Later 100,000&nbsp;unionists converged on the drive leading to Stormont, where Craig addressed the crowds, but deferred to the outgoing Prime Minister Brian Faulkner who managed to disperse the crowds.
On 3 June 1972, VUPP organised a march in [[Derry]] against the creation of no-go areas in [[Irish nationalism|Nationalist]] districts which ended in violence on the city's Craigavon bridge. Despite the violence, Craig pledged to continue the marches stating: "We are no longer protesting - we are demanding action."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/3/newsid_2496000/2496155.stm VUPP organises march in Derry] BBC News</ref>

In February 1973 it was one of the only parties to support the two-day general strike organised by the [[Loyalist Association of Workers]] in protest at the internment of Protestants. <ref name="books.google.co.uk"/> The strike had the further stated goal to "re-establish some kind of Protestant or loyalist control over the affairs in the province, especially over security policy" The strike resulted in high levels of violence with five people, including a fireman, being killed, seven people wounded, several explosions and numerous malicious fires.
<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/uwc/bac.htm Background to the Ulster Workers Council Strike] Conflict Archive on the INternet</ref> 

The strike proved to be a forerunner of the [[Ulster Workers Council Strike]] the following year, in which  VUPP again played a prominent role, making their headquarters in Hawthornden Road, Belfast, available to the strike leaders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=liiq7RU67OoC&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=ernest+baird+vanguard&source=web&ots=azFsMFDtFh&sig=4LbGo7efMmRpA6NWxzvVDu9yvqc&hl=en |title=Crimes of loyalty: A history of the UDA by Ian Wood, p36-7 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref> with Craig a leading member of the UWC coordinating committee<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qps14mSlghcC&pg=PA260&lpg=PA260&dq=william+craig+uwc+strike&source=web&ots=2i3PM6JAZ4&sig=RTN9yWSNwEVH40ZdG4aJJmiEZ3k&hl=en#PPA260,M1 Encyclopedia of British and Irish political organizations] Google Books</ref>

In addition to large rallies, Vanguard used other tactics in order to try to put pressure on the British Government. In July 1972, they called for a rent and rate strike, a proposal which put them at odds with other unionist parties and which was criticized by the [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]].<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1972/jul/24/northern-ireland#S5CV0841P0-04744 NORTHERN IRELAND] Hansard, 24 July 1972, Col.1350</ref> Several months later, on 19 October 1972, Craig addressed a meeting of the right wing [[Conservative Monday Club]] during which he claimed he could mobilise 80,000&nbsp;men <U+201C>who are prepared to come out and shoot and kill.<U+201D><ref>[http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/attached_files/Pdf%20files/Dublin_Barron_Rep031204.pdf Interim Report on the Report of the Commission of Enquiry into the 1972 Dublin bombings, p12] Office of the Taoiseach</ref>

==Electoral performances==
The party contested a succession of elections: to the brief Sunningdale Assembly, the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 General Election]], the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 General Election]] and the 1975 elections to the Constitutional Convention. The 1973 Sunningdale and local council elections were fought in an informal alliance with the [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]] as "the loyalist coalition" while the latter three were fought as part of the [[United Ulster Unionist Council]], a more formal arrangement, with the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and the Ulster Unionists, where the anti-Sunningdale wing of the party was now in control.

The number of Vanguard councillors elected in 1973 is a matter of some dispute among the various sources, as Whyte<ref>[http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/flg73.htm 1973 Local Government elections] ARK - Access Research Knowledge</ref> notes: "there is huge potential for confusion among the various candidate designations." As a minimum, James Knight, writing closest to the time, counted eight councillors<ref>James Knight and Nicolas Baxter-Moore's Northern Ireland Local Government Elections, 1973</ref> CAIN counts nine Vanguard councillors - counting an additional councillor in [[Ards Borough Council|Ards]]. Whyte counts ten, ignoring the councillor in Ards but counting two additional councillors in [[Craigavon Borough Council|Craigavon]] who he says were described as Vanguard councillors on the ballot paper.<ref>[http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/73-81lgcraigavon.htm Craigavon 1973 local election results] ARK - Access Research Knowledge</ref>

However in addition to the eleven above, a further thirteen councillors elected in 1973 (usually under a 'loyalist' label) contested the 1977 local elections either for Vanguard or for their splinter party, the [[United Ulster Unionist Party]]. This includes seven councillors elected as loyalists in 1973 who ran as VUPP candidates in 1977, namely Seymour, Armstrong, Semple and Stewart ([[Larne Borough Council|Larne]]), Green and Mary O'Fee ([[North Down Borough Council|North Down]]) and [[Glenn Barr]] ([[Derry City Council|Londonderry]].) A further four sitting councillors elected as Loyalists stood as UUUP candidates in 1977, namely McKeever (Larne), Ritchie ([[Carrickfergus Borough Council|Carrickfergus]]), Scott ([[Castlereagh Borough Council|Castlereagh]]) and Parke ([[Cookstown District Council|Cookstown]]). Ben Horan, elected as a 'Unionist' in [[Belfast City Council|Belfast]] in 1973, announced two days after the election in the local press that he would sit as a VUPP councillor<ref>Belfast Telegraph, 1 June 1973, p10</ref> although he stood in 1977 as a UUUP candidate. Finally, Randall Crawford, elected in [[Coleraine Borough Council|Coleraine]] in 1973 and 1977 as a non-party candidate, stood for [[Londonderry (Assembly constituency)|Londonderry]] in the 1975 Constitutional convention election as a VUPP candidate.<ref>[http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/cldy.htm 1975 Londonderry Convention election result] ARK - Access Research Knowledge</ref> 

A further councillor, Mrs M. Corrie, elected in Castlereagh as a United Loyalist, is described in contemporary press reports as a Vanguard councillor, but did not contest the 1977 local elections.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/1974/no070/miller.htm International Socialism No.70 p17-21] Marxists Internet Archive</ref>
   
During the 1973-75 period VUPP was able to match or even beat the DUP in several elections. However their prospects of replacing the DUP as the second party of Unionism came to grief as a result of events during the Constitutional Convention.

==1975/76 Split==
The Constitutional Convention was intended to serve as a forum to allow the politicians of Northern Ireland to draw up their own proposals for the political future of the province, though this proved unsuccessful. However it led to William Craig proposing a voluntary coalition with the Nationalist [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]] in the event of there being a state of emergency. The move was a considerable surprise with a confidential government memo commenting: <U+201C>Mr. Craig appears to some as a knight in shining armour. The fact is that his aims were &ndash; and still are &ndash; simple: to get a devolved government which would control security policy as quickly as possible, on the basis of a gentleman's agreement that the SDLP would participate in government for a year or two.<U+201D> <ref name="nationalarchives.gov.uk">[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/releases/2005/highlights_december/december29/northernireland.htm National Archives 19 September 1975, Catalogue ref CAB 134/3921] National Archives</ref> But any idea of power sharing was anathema to many Unionist in the post-Sunningdale climate of 1975. Indeed in January 1976, Deputy leader Ernest Baird warned that <U+201C>If Westminster does not accept the Protestants' rejection of power-sharing, it must face the inevitable consequences of a final conflict."<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913890-2,00.html Down the Road to Hell] Time Magazine, 19 January 1976</ref>

As a result the party was bitterly split with only [[David Trimble]] and [[Glenn Barr]] backing Craig with the other eleven convention members challenging Craig's leadership. Craig however claimed that he had the backing of the party's rank and file and this was confirmed when sixty percent of party members and backed him at a specially convened meeting. The dissidents then broke away to form what would later become the [[United Ulster Unionist Party]].

On 8 September 1975, Craig<U+2019>s proposals were decisively rejected at a meeting of the UUUC with 37&nbsp;votes against and only Craig voting in favour.<ref name="nationalarchives.gov.uk"/> Consequently, Craig and the rump of VUPP were expelled from the UUUC.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qps14mSlghcC&pg=PA262&lpg=PA262&dq=vanguard+unionist+uuup&source=web&ots=2i3PM7AzW9&sig=76vOV-dseYVWzf67BNSUZAFZpW0&hl=en Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organisations, p899] Google Books</ref>

==Decline and disbandment==
The 1977 local elections were overshadowed by the abortive United Unionist Action Council (UUAC) Strike which was mainly supported by the DUP and the UUUM. In contrast to 1974, when they had played a prominent role in the previous strike Vanguard criticized the strike and together with the UUP and Orange Order, called for it to be abandoned.<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/uuac/chron.htm Chronology of UUAC 1977 strike] Conflict Archive on the INternet</ref>

The 1977 council elections were seen as a crucial test of Vanguard's ability to survive as a party and ultimately the party failed that test. Although thirteen councilors elected in 1973 stood as VUPP candidates, the party emerged from the election with only five councillors<ref>[http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/flg77.htm 1977 council election results] ARK - Access Research Knowledge</ref> compared to twelve councilors elected in 1977 for their breakaway rival the UUUP.

Craig then applied to rejoin the UUP in February 1978 and subsequently merged the remainder of Vanguard back into the Ulster Unionist Party, where it returned to its origin as a pressure group within the UUP as the Vanguard movement, although this too seems to have quickly faded away. The [[Democratic Unionist Party]] subsequently became the main Unionist party offering a more right wing alternative position to the Ulster Unionists.
In the 1982 elections for the new Northern Ireland Assembly, Craig, who had once more left the Ulster Unionists after losing his seat at Westminster, revived the name Vanguard for his candidacy in [[Belfast East (Assembly constituency)|East Belfast]]. However he failed to get elected.

==Prominent UUP members in Vanguard==
Several prominent current Ulster Unionist politicians were members of Vanguard, including future UUP MP [[David Burnside]] (who was Vanguard's press officer from 1974 to 1977<ref>[http://www.uup.org/people_davidburnside.htm Burnside profile] Ulster Unionist Party</ref>) while those elected for VUPP in 1975 included future UUP leaders [[David Trimble]] (who briefly served as Vanguard Deputy Leader) and [[Reg Empey]] who served as Vanguard chairman from 1974-75.<ref>[http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/members/biogs_03/empey_r.htm Biography of Reg Empey] Northern Ireland Assembly</ref> Former deputy speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, [[Jim Wilson (UK politician)|Jim Wilson]], served as a Vanguard councillor on [[Newtownabbey Borough Council]] from 1975 to 1976 before joining the UUP<ref>[http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/Speakers_Office/DSbiography.htm Jim Wilson biography] NI Assembly</ref> [[Martin Smyth|rev. Martin Smyth]] later a UUP MP and Grand Master of the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]] was deputy leader of the Vanguard movement but declined to join the party.
