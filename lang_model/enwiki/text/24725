In his review for [[DVD Talk]], Paul Mavis "highly recommended" the Volume 1 season set, saying "[This] is another winner from Nickelodeon DVD, and a must-have for parents who can't get enough of the braying little yellow sponge. Oh yeah; the kids will probably like it, too."<ref name=SV1/> Mavis also praised the voice actors who contributed on the show, and wrote "As funny as the stories are, and in this collection, there are some real gems, I can't stress enough the importance of those voice talents in conveying the unhinged, manic quality that is so integral to the success of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''.<ref name=SV1/> In a separate review for the Volume 2 DVD, Mavis only "recommended" the set and wrote "SpongeBob may, and I repeat, 'may,' be starting to level off."<ref name=SV2/> He particularly criticized the later entries as "indication of that potential trend."<ref name=SV2/>

Roy Hrab of [[DVD Verdict]] was positive on the season, but wrote "I do not think that adults will be as entertained as in previous seasons. The comedy is more targeted at the kids than in the past."<ref name=SV11/> In particular, Hrab cited the episode "Rise and Shine" as "tiresome (for adults, anyway; kids will enjoy it)."<ref name=SV11/> In conclusion, he said "there's nothing new here and adults will be disappointed, but the latest installment of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' delivers a lot of silly and good-natured fun for the kids and there's nothing wrong with that."<ref name=SV11/> In the Volume 2 review also for the DVD Verdict, Dennis Prince said "[The season] is not the series' best work but, nevertheless, is an improvement over the inexplicable sourness of the previous Season 4."<ref name=SV21/> He added "[It] delivers more of what SpongeBob fans crave."<ref name=SV21/>
