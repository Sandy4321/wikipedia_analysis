"'''Window of Opportunity'''"  is the sixth episode from [[Stargate SG-1 (season 4)|season 4]] of the [[science fiction]] [[television series]] ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', and first aired on the American subscription channel [[Showtime]] on August 4, 2000. The episode is based on a ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'' time loop scenario, with [[SG-1]] team members [[Jack O'Neill|Colonel O'Neill]] and [[Teal'c]] repeatedly reliving the same six or ten hours<ref>Dialog in "Window of Opportunity" gives two time lengths for the time loops.
* '''Carter:''' "Both of them claim they have memories of SG-1's mission to P4X-639." / '''Hammond:''' "A mission that isn't scheduled to start for six hours."
* '''Carter:''' "Maybe you were sent back in time." / '''O'Neill:''' "For what? Six hours?"
* '''Daniel:''' "Who would build a device that loops time every ten hours?"
</ref> after a mission on a planet. Since the rest of their team and all personnel at [[Stargate Command]] are unaware of the happenings and do not remember the time resets, O'Neill and Teal'c are forced to find a solution on their own.

Penned by [[Joseph Mallozzi]] and [[Paul Mullie]], "Window of Opportunity" was the writing duo's second script, and their first episode to air. Mallozzi and Mullie would later become executive producers of both ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''. The episode's unique story style caused an unexpected shortage of footage during filming, which director [[Peter DeLuise]] tried to compensate by shooting additional unscripted scenes, many of which were humorous. "Window of Opportunity" is widely regarded as a fan favorite.

== Plot ==

On a mission on P4X-639, a planet experiencing strong solar activity, the SG-1 team encounters an alien archaeologist named Malikai ([[Robin Mossley]]). When a [[geomagnetic storm|geomagnetic disturbance]] hits its peak, the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] activates simultaneously on the planet and on Earth, and a flash strikes Malikai, [[Jack O'Neill|Colonel O'Neill]] ([[Richard Dean Anderson]]) and [[Teal'c]] ([[Christopher Judge]]) near an [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient]] altar. Moments later, O'Neill finds himself in the [[Stargate Command]] (SGC) cafeteria in the middle of a breakfast conversation with [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Dr. Daniel Jackson]] ([[Michael Shanks]]) and [[Samantha Carter|Major Carter]] ([[Amanda Tapping]]), who claim to have no knowledge of the planet. O'Neill and Teal'c later express familiarity with the events, but they are checked and certified to be in perfect health. Before SG-1 can resume their planned mission to the planet, an unscheduled offworld activation of the Earth Stargate, accompanied by flashes, transports O'Neill back to breakfast.

While the events at the SGC repeat themselves, Daniel makes first progress in the translation of writings in the photos of the ancient altar. SG-1 return to the planet where Malikai makes a slip, but O'Neill finds himself back at breakfast before the altar's activation can be stopped. With the help of O'Neill's and Teal'c's explanations, Carter devises a plan to break the [[time loop]] by preventing an incoming wormhole, which fails. Meanwhile, Daniel attempts to translate the altar's writing loop after loop, but his memory is reset each time along with everyone else's, and he cannot possibly translate it all within just a few hours.  Ultimately, O'Neill and Teal'c realize the only solution is to learn and remember the alien language themselves. After many loops of teaching, Daniel makes an offhand remark about events that occur during each loop having no consequences once the loop is over, which inspires O'Neill and Teal'c to indulge in wildly outrageous behaviour as a means of dealing with the boredom and frustration of being caught in repeating time.  O'Neill and Teal'c play golf through the active Stargate, Teal'c takes action against the painful starts of his loops, O'Neill tries pottery-making, bicycles through the base, and just before the end of one loop, resigns from the Air Force for the sole purpose of grabbing Carter and kissing her.

After what is later believed to have been at least three months, Daniel is finally able to reconstruct the planet's history with the finished translations: the Ancients had attempted to escape a mysterious plague by building a time machine but never got it to work properly. Upon returning to the planet, SG-1 learn of the death of Malikai's wife, whom Malikai wants to visit in the past with the help of the time machine. O'Neill's experience of his son's death convinces Malikai to shut down the device before yet another new loop can start. Back at the SGC, O'Neill, Carter, and Daniel have their first breakfast after the loops, and O'Neill answers Daniel's question about unusual activities in the loops with a long look at Carter.

==Production==

"Window of Opportunity" was the second ''Stargate SG-1'' script by [[Joseph Mallozzi]] and [[Paul Mullie]], and their first episode to air. The writing duo's first script, "[[Scorched Earth (Stargate SG-1)|Scorched Earth]]", would air three episodes later.<ref name=ac_406_pdl /> Choosing "Ad Infinitum" as the episode's working title,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/archive/001119_1.shtml |title=Joseph Mallozzi chat transcript |publisher=''[[GateWorld]]'' |date=November 19, 2000 |accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref> Mallozzi and Mullie originally pitched "Window of Opportunity" as a darker story from the finished episode. SG-1 would encounter a world whose scientists work feverishly on preventing an imminent apocalypse, but after being unable to find a solution in time, they initiate a time loop that would trap the SG-1 team.<ref name=gw_jm1>{{cite web |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/joseph_mallozzi_1.shtml |title=Interviews: Joseph Mallozzi |publisher=''[[GateWorld]]'' |month=May | year=2006 |accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref> Executive producer [[Brad Wright]] however noted the similarities to the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Cause and Effect (TNG episode)|Cause and Effect]]",<ref name=companion>{{cite book |last=Gibson |first=Thomasina |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Stargate SG-1: The Illustrated Companion Seasons 3 and 4 |year=2002 |publisher=Titan Books |isbn=1-84023355-9}}</ref> and writer [[Robert C.

The off-world scenes were filmed on an interior sound stage, using occasional lens flares and off-camera fans to simulate weather.<ref name=ac_406_pdl /> A matte painting by the in-house [[visual effects]] department later served as a sky replacement for the used [[greenscreen]]. The [[Vancouver]]-based company GDFX was responsible for almost all visual effects shots, some of which were re-used within the episode to save money. Other visual effects clips were re-used from previous episodes. "Window of Opportunity" was the first episode to feature a rear-screen projection in the briefing room.<ref name=ac_406_jt>{{cite video |people=[[James Tichenor|Tichenor, James]] |date=2001 |title=Audio Commentary for "Window of Opportunity" |medium = DVD &ndash; Stargate SG-1: Season 4 |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> To speed up the shooting process, scenes were filmed in thematic blocks instead of in a story-chronological order, and short sequences were re-used to help the audience with a visual recall in new scenes.<ref name=ac_406_pdl /> [[Sound effects]] were later added to give the wooden altar prop the impression of being made of stone.<ref name=ac_406_jt />

It became evident by the third day of production that the episode was going to run significantly short, partly caused by the time-efficient filming style. The scene in which Daniel informs Jack and Teal'c of the opportunity to do whatever they like, was a late pitch by Brad Wright,<ref name=ac_406_pdl /><ref name=companion /> who had also had the idea for some time to show someone golfing through the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]].<ref name=dvd_s3 /> Preliminary discussions about [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generating]] the golf ball to not break the US$&nbsp;100,000 Stargate prop were later overturned, and the actors used a real golf ball.<ref name=ac_406_jt /> Many of the other humorous scenes in "Window of Opportunity" were improvised on set during filming.<ref name=ac_406_pdl /> With juggling being one of Richard Dean Anderson's earlier careers,<ref name=approaching /> director Peter DeLuise filmed the juggling sequence in a last effort to fill the episode's time slot.<ref name=ac_406_pdl /> "Window of Opportunity" has no deleted scenes.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mallozzi |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Mallozzi |url=http://josephmallozzi.wordpress.com/2007/02/24/february-23-2007/ |title=Thoughts and Tirades, Rants and Ruminations &ndash; February 23, 2007 |publisher=josephmallozzi.wordpress.com |date=February 23, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref>

As the first episodes of season 4 addressed the attraction between O'Neill and Carter, its aftereffects were chosen to be still noticeable in "Window of Opportunity".<ref name=ac_406_jt /> The progressing frustration of Teal'c, "the man of infinite patience",<ref name=ac_406_jt /> is shown by his Kel'no'reem'ing (a fictional medital state) during the briefing. The episode's main guest star was [[Robin Mossley]] as Malikai; Mossley would play a different character in the season 10 episode "[[Morpheus (Stargate SG-1)|Morpheus]]". Several crew members make [[cameo appearance]]s in "Window of Opportunity". Nicole Forrest, the show's head of accounting and director [[Peter Woeste]]'s wife, appears as Malikai's wife on a photographic device. One of Anderson's [[stand-in]]s on ''SG-1'', Bill Nikolai, plays the technician in O'Neill's bicycle scene. Director Peter DeLuise briefly appears as an airman who helps Daniel recover from being repeatedly knocked down by Sgt. [[Siler (Stargate)|Siler]] in each loop. Siler himself is played by stunt coordinator [[Dan Shea (actor)|Dan Shea]]. The name of writer Joseph Mallozzi appears as the author of the book that O'Neill and Teal'c use to study the Ancient language.<ref name=ac_406_pdl />

==Reception==

In his book ''Approaching the Possible'', Jo Storm saw the episode's title hinting at an "inevitable" story line about the sexual tension between O'Neill and Carter that has been looming since the beginning of the series. The characters "break[ing] the rules of conduct for their jobs" ([[fraternization]]) made the episode "seem completely unnatural", while it allowed the writers to explore possibilities in the narrative. Jo Storm also credited the writers for breaking the "boring" convention of getting either only one or all teammembers caught in a time loop.<ref name=approaching>{{cite book | last = Storm | first = Jo | title = Approaching the Possible: The World of Stargate SG-1 | publisher = ECW Press | location = Toronto, Canada | year = 2005 | pages = 268&ndash;270 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=T196lU-jXI8C&hl=de&sig=mWvOnd7b6Kgru829GLVX6hSxyps#PPA268,M1 | isbn = 1-55022-705-X }}</ref> The producers enjoyed having O'Neill and Teal'c instead of the usual intellectual combination of Carter and Daniel solve the puzzle.<ref name=dvd_s3>{{cite video | people = [[Brad Wright|Wright, Brad]] | title = "Secret Files of the SGC &ndash; The Stargate Universe" |date=2001 | medium = DVD &ndash; Stargate SG-1: Season 3 | publisher = [[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> Peter DeLuise regarded the episode as "funnier" and "more lighthearted" than usual episodes.<ref name=ac_406_pdl />
