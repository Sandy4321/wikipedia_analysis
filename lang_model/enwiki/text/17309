Born at Ingroli in [[Berar Province|Berar]], Khaparde studied [[Sanskrit]] and [[English Literature]] before beginning law. He graduated with an LLB in 1884, which led him to Government service. He served as a Munsiff and an assistant commissioner at Berar between 1885 to 1890. Closely associated with [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], he took a keen interest in politics and in 1890 resigned from service to begin his own law practice at [[Amrawati]]. Khaparde was the chairman of the reception committee at the Amarawati [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] in 1897.<ref name=Yadav63/><ref name=Wolpert126/> He attended, along with Tilak, the Shivaji Festival of the Congress at [[Calcutta]] in 1906. He was at this time associated with the "extremist" camp within the Congress, led by [[Lal-Bal-Pal]] trio of [[Lala Lajpat Rai]], Bal Gangadhar Tilak and [[Bipin Chandra Pal]].<ref name=Sinha154/> A close ally and one of the most trusted lieutanants of Tilak,<ref name=Wolpert126/> Khaparde's strong and singular personal influence in the Central Provinces earned him the epitaph of "the Nawab of Berar".<ref name=Wolpert126/> Between 1908 and 1910, Khaparde travelled to England to conduct Tilak's appeal to the [[Privy Council]].<ref name=Yadav63/> Intelligence reports indicate that along with Bipin Chandra Pal, he was at this time associated with the [[India House]].<ref name=Popplewell129>{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=129}}</ref>

Later, Khaparde was a founding member of Tilak's [[Indian Home Rule League]] in 1916,<ref name=Sinha154/> and was a member of the Congress's deputation to the [[Viceroy of India|Viceroy]] on constitutional reforms.<ref name=Yadav63/> Between May 1919 and January 1920, Khaparde was in England again as a delegate of the Home Rule League's deputation to the Joint Parliamentary committee. During his stay of seven months he made speeches in England. He become popular by way of his wit, humour and mannerisum and hence some news-paper described him as ''[[Mark Twain]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/VOL-VII/life_sketch.pdf |author=Dr B G Kunte |publisher=Government of Maharashtra, Gazatte Department |year=1978 |page=2 |title=Life-Sketch of Dada Saheb Khaparde |accessdate=5 February 2010}}</ref> 

Following the inauguration of [[Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms]], he was selected a member of the [[Imperial Legislative Council]].<ref name=Yadav63/><ref name=Sinha154/> However, in 1920, Khaparde left the Congress anticipating Gandhi's [[Non-cooperation movement]]. Between 1920 and 1925, Khaparde elected a member of the [[Central Legislative Assembly]]. 

G.S. Khaparde was also a noted devotee of the [[Shirdi Sai Baba]]. His first interaction with the Baba was in December 1910 when he sought refuge at [[Shirdi]] escaping the incarceration and purge of political dissidents in India at the time.<ref name=Rigopoulos171>{{Harvnb|Rigopoulos|1993|p=171}}</ref>  Between 1910 and 1918, his ''Shirdi diary'' recording visits to the Sai Baba shed much light on the Baba's life, his routine, and his work.<ref name=Ruhela174>{{Harvnb|Ruhela|1998|p=174}}</ref>

G.S. Khaparde died on 1 July 1938. He was survived by his son [[Balkrishna Ganesh Khaparde]], also a lawyer and leader.
