{{Donizetti operas}} 
''[[L'ange de Nisida]]'' (''The Angel of Nisida'') is an ''[[opera semiseria]]'' in four acts by Italian composer [[Gaetano Donizetti]], from a [[libretto]] by Alphonse Royer and Gustave Va<U+00EB>z. Parts of the libretto are considered analogous with the libretto for [[Giovanni Pacini|Giovani Pacini's]] ''Adelaide e Comingio'', and the final scene is based on the [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Thomas-Marie de Baculard d'Arnaud]] play ''Les Amants malheureux, ou le comte de Comminges''. Donizetti worked on the opera in the autumn of 1839<U+2014>its final page is dated 27 December 1839. Because the subject matter involved the mistress of a [[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitan]] king, and may thus have caused difficulties with the Italian censors, Donizetti decided that the opera should be presented in France. However, the theater company Donizetti contracted went bankrupt. ''L'ange'' was never performed and was reworked as ''[[La favorite]]'' in September 1840.

== Context ==
=== Background ===
''L'ange de Nisida'' incorporated many of the manuscript pages from ''Adelaide'', an unfinished score that Italian composer Gaetano Donizetti was probably working on in 1834, from a libretto of unknown origin. This libretto contained elements from the 1790 Parisian play ''Les Amants malheureux, ou le comte de Comminges'' by Fran<U+00E7>ois-Thomas-Marie de Baculard d'Arnaud.<ref name=Ashbrook578>Ashbrook, p. 578</ref> In his book ''Donizetti and his Operas'', musicologist [[William Ashbrook]] states that the ''Adelaide'' libretto has similarities to that of the Giovani Pacini opera ''Adelaide e Comingio'', whose libretto was written by [[Gaetano Rossi]]. Donizetti is believed to have taken the manuscript for ''Adelaide'' to Paris in 1838. Because the subject matter of ''L'ange'' involved the mistress of a Neapolitan king, and may thus have caused difficulties with the Italian censors, Donizetti decided that the opera should be presented in France.<ref name=Ashbrook151>Ashbrook, p. 151</ref> Additionally, in September 1839, the French press had announced ''La Fianc<U+00E9>e du Tyrol'', a translation of Donizetti's 1833 opera ''Il furioso all'isola di San Domingo''.<ref name=Everist158>Everist, p. 158</ref> In October 1839, he wrote to a friend in Naples: "''La Fianc<U+00E9>e du Tyrol'' will be ''Il furioso'' amplified, ''L'ange de Nisida'' will be new."<ref name=Crutchfield487>Crutchfield, p. 487</ref> Donizetti began work on ''L'ange'' shortly thereafter;<ref name=Ashbrook578/> ''La Fianc<U+00E9>e du Tyrol'' never materialized.<ref name=Everist158/>

=== Composition ===
Donizetti completed ''L'ange de Nisida'' on 27 December 1839, the date on the final page of the [[autograph]] score.<ref name=Ashbrook144>Ashbrook, p. 144</ref> He had been working on ''[[Le duc d'Albe]]'', but postponed work on the half-completed score in favor of ''L'ange'' and ''[[La fille du r<U+00E9>giment]]''.<ref name=Ashbrook434>Ashbrook, p. 434</ref> 

Although Donizetti noted in correspondence to his close friend Tommaso Persico in Naples that ''L'ange'' was "an opera in three acts",<ref name=Ashbrook145>Ashbrook, p. 145</ref> both the autograph score and Donizetti's contract with Ant<U+00E9>nor Joly, the owner of the theater company Donizetti contracted, make clear that ''L'ange'' had four acts. Regardless, Donizetti's letter has caused confusion among opera journalists and scholars. For example, ''[[The Musical Times]]'' journalist Dean Winton wrote of the Italian version of ''La favorite'' in 1979: "[I]t was expanded from an unperformed three-act French opera, ''L'ange de Nisida''."<ref name=Winton>Winton (1979), p. 41</ref> Ashbrook speculates that Donizetti may have considered the first two acts as one.<ref name=Ashbrook650>Ashbrook, p. 650</ref>

=== Contract and cancellation ===
On 5 January 1840, Donizetti signed a rehearsal and performance contract with his librettists and Ant<U+00E9>nor Joly,<ref name=Ashbrook145/> who was operating a company named Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre de la Renaissance and giving performances at the Salle Ventadour in Paris.<ref name=Ashbrook142>Ashbrook, p. 142</ref> Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre de la Renaissance chose ''L'ange'' over [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Das Liebesverbot]]''.<ref name=Fauser>Fauser and Everist p.233</ref> Joly's company had premiered the French version of Donizetti's ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' the previous year, and ''L'ange'' was meant to be its successor.<ref name=Marston>Marston</ref> The contract, which is on display at the [[Biblioth<U+00E8>que-Mus<U+00E9>e de l'Op<U+00E9>ra National de Paris]], stipulates that ''L'ange'' be performed uninterrupted twenty times unless three consecutive performances sold poorly, and that Joly could not premiere any other opera until the revenue from ''L'ange'' started to decline. The contract contains nothing about Donizetti's compensation; therefore, it is possible that another contract existed.<ref name=Ashbrook650>Ashbrook, p. 650</ref> ''L'ange'' was set to begin rehearsal on 1 February 1840. Donizetti had two other operas in various stages of preparation at other theaters during this time: ''[[Poliuto|Les martyrs]]'' and ''La fille du r<U+00E9>giment''.<ref name=Ashbrook145/>

Later in January, Joly terminated all opera productions of the Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre de la Renaissance company due to financial hardship, despite a reported 5,000-franc loan from Donizetti. Joly tried to keep the operation afloat by staging ballets, but it closed completely in May 1840.<ref name=Ashbrook145/> He filed for bankruptcy and therefore avoided paying Donizetti the large fee owed for backing out of the production.<ref name=Ashbrook145/> Writing for the ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', Mark Everist referred to ''L'ange'' as one of "the most spectacular casualties of the collapse of music drama at the Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre de la Renaissance".<ref name=Everist158/>

=== Reworking ===
Donizetti managed to retrieve the score of ''L'ange de Nisida'' from Joly's company<ref name=Marston>Marston</ref> and reworked it as ''[[La favorite]]'' (now more commonly known by its Italian title, ''La favorita'') in September 1840 for a December premiere in Italy.<ref name=Ashbrook569>Ashbrook, p. 569</ref> To circumvent the Italian censors Donizetti agreed to plot modifications; ''La favorite'' is about a medieval King of Castille.<ref name=Marston>Marston</ref>

The presence and influence of ''L'ange'' is evident in Donizetti's autograph score of ''La favorite'', which features "large chunks" of ''L'ange'' "cut up and interleaved" in which new character names and text for ''La favorite'' overwrite the old. The final page of ''L'ange'' was used as the final page of ''La favorite''; therefore, both operas bear the same finish date on the last page.<ref name=Ashbrook654>Ashbrook, p. 654</ref> Donizetti's contract for ''La favorite'' demanded a 1 December 1840 premiere, leaving him little time for dramatic changes.<ref name=Ashbrook153>Ashbrook, p. 153</ref> In his 1965 biography ''Donizetti'', Ashbrook surmises that this tight deadline gave rise to the legend that Donizetti actually composed the last act of ''La favorite'' in a single night.<ref name=Winton439>Winton (1965), p. 439</ref> In fact, the libretto of ''L'ange'' and the autograph score of ''La favorite'' make clear that the final act of ''La favorite'' was completed long before Donizetti began the rest of it in September<U+2014>Donizetti lifted it from ''L'ange'' with the exception of two solo passages.<ref name=Ashbrook154>Ashbrook, p. 154</ref> He brought in librettist [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Scribe]] to oversee the new text, which also required the approval of starring mezzo-soprano Rosine Stoltz. The finished product was an amalgamation of the unfinished ''Adelaide'', the never-performed ''L'ange de Nisida'', and new material worked into the score by Donizetti and into the libretto by Scribe.<ref name=Marston>Marston</ref> ''La favorite'' premiered on 2 December 1840.<ref name=Ashbrook154/>

Ashbrook has compared the surviving autograph scores of ''L'ange de Nisida'' and ''La favorite'' to determine precisely how much material ''L'ange'' provided for the latter. While the events in ''L'ange'' are set in 1470 in Nisida and Naples, ''La favorite'' is set in [[Santiago de Compostela]] and [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], both in Spain, prior to 1350. Donizetti made fundamental changes to the first half of ''La favorite'' and little remains of ''L'ange''.{{#tag:ref|Donizetti did take a line from the opening of ''L'ange'', "Douce ange, une f<U+00E9>e inconnue," ("Sweet angel, a fairy unknown") and place it in the first scene of ''La favorite'' with different music but virtually identical text.<ref name=Ashbrook654/>|group=notes}} However, the central conflict of the story involving the marriage and subsequent death is essentially the same from one opera to the other. Some of the character names are also similar or identical.<ref name=Ashbrook154/>

A transcription of the ''L'ange'' libretto is kept at the Fondazione Donizetti library in [[Bergamo]],<ref name=FD>Fondazione Donizetti</ref> and was printed in a 2002 issue of the Italian-language journal for The Donizetti Society.<ref name=Desniou>Desniou and Lo Presti, p. 2</ref>

== Roles ==
As the opera never got to the rehearsal stage, little is known about the intended cast. However, in a letter to his close friend Tommaso Persico, Donizetti expressed his desire to give the title role to Juliette Bourgeois, a temperamental soprano who requested a large sum of money to perform in France. (She was later to create the title role in Donizetti's ''[[La fille du r<U+00E9>giment]]'')<ref name=Ashbrook151/>

== Synopsis ==
[[File:NisidaSeenFromPosillipo.jpg|thumb|right|220px|alt=A small island with steep, low cliffs viewed from a distance. Much of the island is covered in greenery, and several multi-story buildings of white, tan, or red are visible on the near side. Other islands are visible in the distant waters.|A view of Nisida]]
Leone de Casaldi is an exiled soldier who makes a forbidden journey to the island of [[Nisida]], outside Naples, Italy, to see Sylvia, with whom he is infatuated. Leone knows she is a noble but little else. While on Nisida, Leone encounters Don Gaspar, Chamberlain to King Fernand of Naples. After hearing Leone's plight, Don Gaspar convinces him to travel to Naples to have his exile lifted. Leone and Sylvia meet in Naples, at which time Leone discovers that she is actually Sylvia de Linares, the King's mistress. She declares her love for Leone but implores him to abandon her and his plans in Naples. When he refuses, the King discovers him and orders Don Gaspar to arrest and imprison him.

The King expresses to Sylvia his desire that she wed him. However, agents of Rome have been plotting to banish the mistress from Naples. When the King, dismayed, offers to grant her any request, she asks that Leone be set free. A monk appears, brandishing the [[Papal bull]] and threatening to banish Sylvia if she remains a mistress to the King. The King plots with Don Gaspar to free Leone and wed him to Sylvia, though Leone would be sent away and Sylvia would remain the King's mistress. Leone and Sylvia marry, but when Leone discovers the plot, he breaks his sword in front of the King and leaves under the monk's escort.

Leone is preparing to take his vows as a monk when Sylvia appears, having followed him disguised as a novice. When she confronts Leone and asks for forgiveness, he realizes his feelings and attempts to flee with her. Sylvia, who has been near death, dies at Leone's feet despite his calls for help.<ref name=Ashbrook569570>Ashbrook, pp. 569<U+2013>570</ref>
