The '''Province of Posen''' ({{lang-de|Provinz Posen}}, {{lang-pl|Prowincja Pozna<U+0144>ska}}) was a province of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] from [[1848]]-[[1918]] and as such part of the [[German Empire]] from 1871 to 1918; the whole area is now part of [[Poland]].  Its capital was [[Pozna<U+0144>]] (German: ''Posen''). Known as the "cradle of the Polish nation", this region was the home to [[Poles]], [[German people|Germans]], some [[Jews]] and a smattering of other peoples. Almost all the Poles were [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], and about 90% of the Germans were [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. The small numbers of Jews were primarily to be found in the larger communities, mostly in skilled crafts, local commerce and regional trading. The smaller the community, the more likely it was to be either Polish or German. These "pockets of ethnicity" existed side by side, with German villages being the most dense in the northwestern areas. With [[Germanization]] policies, the population became more German until the end of the [[19th century]], when the trend reversed (so called [[Ostflucht]]). This was despite efforts of the government in Berlin, which established a [[Settlement Commission|resettlement program]] to buy land from Poles and make it available only to Germans.

== Description ==

The land is mostly flat, drained by two major [[drainage basin|watershed]] systems; the [[Note<U+0107>]] (German: ''Netze'') in the north and the [[Warta]] (German: ''Warthe'') in the center. [[Ice Age]] [[glacier]]s left [[moraine]] deposits and the land is speckled with hundreds of "finger lakes", streams flowing in and out on their way to one of the two rivers.

[[Agriculture]] was the primary industry, as one would expect for the [[1800s]]. The [[three-field system]] was used to grow a variety of crops, primarily [[rye]], [[sugar beets]], [[potatoes]], other [[cereal|grains]], and some [[tobacco]] and [[hops]]. Significant parcels of wooded land provided building materials and [[firewood]]. Small numbers of [[livestock]] existed, including [[geese]], but a fair amount of [[sheep]] were herded.

When this area came under Prussian control, the [[feudal system]] was still in force. It was officially ended in Prussia (''see'' [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl, baron von und zum Stein|Freiherr vom Stein]]) in [[1810]] ([[1864]] in [[Congress Poland]]), but lingered in some practices until the late 1800s.  The situation was thus that (primarily) Polish serfs lived and worked side by side with (predominantly) free German settlers. Though the settlers were given initial advantages, in time their lots were not much different. In simplistic terms, serfs worked for the lord and the lord took care of them. Settlers worked for themselves and took care of themselves, but paid taxes to the lord. 

Typically, an estate would have its [[Manor house|manor]] and farm buildings, and a village nearby for the Polish laborers. Near that village, there might be a German settlement. And in the woods, there would be a forester's dwelling. The estate owners, usually of the nobility, owned the local [[grist mill]], and often other types of mills or perhaps a [[distillery]]. In many places, [[windmills]] dotted the landscape, reminding one of the earliest settlers, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], who began the process of turning unproductive river marshes into fields. This process was finished by the German settlers who were used to reclaim unproductive lands (not only marshland) for the host estate owners.

== Changing hands ==

Originally part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Kingdom of Poland]], this area roughly coincided with the Polish region known as [[Greater Poland]] in the east. 

The mid-1600s brought devastation from invading Swedish forces during [[The Deluge (Polish history)|"the Deludge"]]

The eastern portions of Posen were taken by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] during the [[Partitions of Poland]]; during the first Partition ([[1772]]), Prussia took just the [[Netze District]], the portion along the [[Note<U+0107>]] (German: ''Netze'') river. Prussia added the remainder during the second Partition in [[1793]]. Prussia briefly lost control during the [[Ko<U+015B>ciuszko Uprising]] in ([[1794]]).

It was initially called "[[South Prussia]]". Prussia (and later Germany) held control of the province until the end of [[World War I]], with the exception of the period of time when [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] changed the landscape of Europe ([[1806]]-[[1815]]). After the defeat of Prussia by [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]], the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] was created with the [[Treaty of Tilsit]]. The Poles were the primary ally of Napoleon in [[Central Europe]], participating in the [[Greater Poland Uprising]] of [[1806]] and supplying troops for his campaigns.

According to the [[Congress of Vienna|Vienna peace congress]], put into action after the fall of Napoleon in [[1815]], Posen was returned to Prussia, and became the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]] ([[1815]]-[[1846]]), a nominally autonomous province under [[Hohenzollern]] rule with the rights of ''"free development of Polish nation, culture and language"'', and was outside the [[German Confederation]]. At this time the city of [[Pozna<U+0144>|Posen]] was the administrative center and the site of the "Prince [[Antoni Henryk Radziwi<U+0142><U+0142>]] of Posen". Shortly after the outbreak of the [[November Uprising]], Prussia revoked the autonomy of the province, in violation of the Vienna Peace Congress arrangements, and in [[1846]] the province was renamed the ''Province of Posen'' and brought to the same standing as other provinces such as [[West Prussia]] and [[Silesia]]. With the unification of Germany after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of [[1871]], the province of Posen became part of the [[German Empire]] ([[1871]]-[[1918]]) and the city of Posen was officially named an imperial residence city.

With the signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] at the end of [[World War I]], most of the province, primarily the areas with a Polish majority, was returned to Poland and reformed as the [[Pozna<U+0144> Voivodship]]. (See also: [[Greater Poland Uprising]].) The remaining German part of the province was reformed as [[Grenzmark Posen-Westpreussen]] with ''Schneidem<U+00FC>hl'' ([[Pi<U+0142>a]]) as its capital, until [[1938]], when it was divided between [[Silesia]], [[Pomerania]] and [[Brandenburg]]. After the German [[invasion of Poland]], the Wehrmacht established ''Wehrkreis XXI'', with the ''Wehrkreis Hauptsitze'' at the city of Posen. This ''wehrkreis'' was under the command of ''General de Artillerie'' [[Walter Petsel]], and its primary operational unit was the ''XXXXVIII Panzer Korps''. Posen was responsible for the ''Milit<U+00E4>rische Unterregion-Hauptsitze'' at ''Posen'', ''Lissa'' ([[Leszno]]), ''Hohensalza'' ([[Inowroc<U+0142>aw]]), ''Leslau'' ([[W<U+0142>oc<U+0142>awek]]), ''Kalisch'' ([[Kalisz]]), and ''Litzmannstadt'' ([[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]]). It maintained training areas at ''Schieratz'' ([[Sieradz]]), and ''Warthelager'' ([[Biedrusko]]).

The remainder of Posen was placed under Polish administration by the Soviet forces after [[World War II]]. During the [[Cold War]], Posen, along with [[Silesia]] and [[Pomerania]], were still in theory claimed by West Germany as the ''[[Historical_Eastern_Germany|German Eastern Territories under Polish Administration]]''; during and after [[Ostpolitik]], however, Germany formally rescinded their claims in 1990, acknowledging the ''facts on the ground'' in the [[Treaty_on_the_Final_Settlement_With_Respect_to_Germany|Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany]].

==Ethnic conflict==
[[Image:Posen 1905.png|thumb|right|300px|The Prussian province of Posen. Yellow colour: polish-speaking areas.]]

Due to the large number of resident Germans (the first Germans coming as [[settlers]]) and the presence of powerful, warring nations on all sides and the internal strife between three major religious faiths, the area was often a battleground of [[Ethnic conflicts in western Poland|ethnic conflicts]].

The 1700s saw the [[Jesuit]]-led [[Counter-Reformation]] enact severe restrictions on the remaining German [[Protestant]]s. The end of the century turned the tables as Prussia seized the area during the [[Partitions of Poland]].

During the first half of the [[1800s]], the German population grew due to state sponsored [[colonisation]]. In the second half, the Polish population grew gradually due to the ''[[Ostflucht]]'' and a higher birth-rate among the Poles. The clash peaked during the [[Kulturkampf]], when many Catholics Germans in Posen joined with ethnic Poles in opposition to the Protestant Prussian government. 

The [[Polish language]] was eventually banned from schools and government offices as part of the [[Germanisation]] policies.

In [[WW2]], part of the German minority living in the territory of the former Posen province formed ''[[Selbstschutz]]'' units, which assisted in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] assault on [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and the subsequent atrocities against Poles and Jews.

==Divisions==

Note: Prussian provinces were subdivided into units called "Kreise" (singular "Kreis", abbreviated "Kr.", English ''circle''), which were similar to large counties in US terms. Cities would have their own "Stadtkreis" (English: ''municipal county'') and the surrounding rural area would be named for the city, but referred to as a "Landkreis" (English: ''rural county''). In the case of Posen, the Landkreis was split into two: Landkreis Posen West, and Landkreis Posen East. 

Data is from Prussian censuses, during a period of state-sponsored [[germanization]], and includes military garrisons. It is commonly criticized for being falsified.
