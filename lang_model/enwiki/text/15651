The '''Shimna River''' ({{lang-ga|Simhn<U+00E9>}}, meaning river of [[bullrushes]]<ref>{{cite book | title=The origin and history of Irish names of places (1910), Volume II | publisher=London Longmans, Green | author=Joyce, P.W | year=1910 | pages=334}}</ref>) is a river in [[County Down]], [[Northern Ireland]]. It rises on the slopes of Ott Mountain, in the [[Mourne Mountains]], and enters the [[Irish Sea]] at [[Newcastle, County Down|Newcastle]], on Dundrum Bay. It is acidic and nutrient-poor, as a result of which its most common flora are [[moss]]es and [[liverwort]]s, including the rare Portuguese feather-moss and Holt's mouse-tail moss. Its principle  fish are [[salmon]] and sea [[trout]], and it is managed by the Shimna Angling Club. The river is an [[Area of Special Scientific Interest]] (ASSI).

The Shimna has a history of [[flood]]ing; the most serious recent flooding was in 2008. There have also been incidents of [[pollution]], and there were serious [[fish kills]] in 2004, 2006 and 2009.

==History==
[[File:"Bridge of one rounded arch over river in woods, seven bosses round arch" = Foley's Bridge, Tollymore (9248163576).jpg|thumb|Foley's Bridge]]
Felix [[Magennis]], a member of the Magennis clan and relative of Hugh Magennis, Lord of Iveagh, built a castle next to the mouth of the Shimna River in 1588. The town is referred to as New Castle in the [[Annals of the Four Masters]] in 1433 so it is likely that he built on the site of an existing structure.<ref>{{cite book | title=Round the Coast of Northern Ireland: Antrim Derry, and Down | publisher=R.

The river is crossed by 16 bridges as it flows through Tollymore Forest Park. The Old Bridge, built by James Hamilton in 1726, is the oldest of the current bridges. The Ivy Bridge was built in 1780 and Foley<U+2019>s Bridge in 1787. Parnell Bridge, named in recognition of Sir John Parnell who visited Tollymore in the late 18th century, was constructed in 1842. It was the last stone bridge to be built in Tollymore. The more recent footbridges are constructed from wood.<ref name="Narnia">{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-19696277.html|     title=Enjoy a Tolly good walk in the heart of Narnia country; WALK THIS WAY | work=Belfast Telegraph | date=January 3, 2009 | accessdate=16 October 2014 | author=McKee, Linda | subscription=yes | via=HighBeam}}</ref> Castle Bridge is located near the mouth where Main Street crosses the river. It was originally called ''Fearsat an Chaislein Nui'' (The Ford or Pass of the Newcastle) and was next to the entrance to the castle. This was replaced by a wider, straighter bridge in the 1890s.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://archive.org/stream/journalofroyalso22royauoft#page/346/mode/2up | title=Proceedings | journal=The journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland | year=1892 | volume=22 | pages=347}}</ref>

The Hermitage is a small stone shelter built into the side of the gorge, above the river. It was designed by James Hamilton in the 1770s as a place for ladies to shelter while the men fished in the river.<ref name="Narnia"/>

Between 1994 and 2003, five [[Stone tool|flint artefacts]] were discovered near the Shimna River. A flake, two blades and a concave [[Scraper (archaeology)|scraper]] were found in two locations in Tollymore Forest. The flake, scraper and one of the blades were identified as [[prehistoric]]. The second blade was identified as Late [[Mesolithic]] or Early [[Neolithic]]. A [[Bronze Age]] barbed and tanged arrowhead was found in a nearby field.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20568361 | title=Random Finds of Flint Objects in the Area of the Shimna River, near Bryansford, County Down | author=McComb, Anne | journal=Ulster Journal of Archaeology, Third Series | year=2005 | volume=64 | pages=172-173 | subscription=yes | via=JSTOR}}</ref>

==Course==
The source of the river is in the [[Mourne Mountains]] on the slopes of Ott Mountain. The river then flows in a northerly direction into Fofanny Dam. It continues its flow in a north-easterly direction into [[Tollymore Forest Park]] where the tributaries Spinkwee and Trassey rivers join it. The Shimna finally flows to the east, then takes a south easterly direction toward [[Newcastle, County Down|Newcastle]] where at one point it flows through Tipperary Wood. The final tributaries to join the river prior to it reaching the sea are the Burren River and the Tullybrannigan River, at Islands Park. Near the mouth, as it flows through Castle Park, it widens quite considerably to create a shallow boating pond. The river's geology, flora and fauna have made it an [[Area of Special Scientific Interest]] (ASSI).<ref name=leaflet>{{cite web | url=http://www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/shimna_river_colour_leaflet.pdf | title=Shimna River, a special place | accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref>

==Geology==
The Shimna is a short spate river, meaning it becomes deep and fast flowing after periods of rain and is slow, with low water levels, in dryer weather.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dardni.gov.uk/forest_guide_notes.pdf | title=The World Around Us at Tollymore Forest Park | publisher=DARD | accessdate=27 October 2014 | pages=9}}</ref> In sections of the river where the gradient is low, there are [[riffle]]s and pools, sandy banks, and [[pebble]]s and scattered boulders on the river bed. Along steeper parts there is a faster flow, [[rapid]]s and [[waterfall|cascades]], and the bed is mad up of bedrock and boulders.<ref name=leaflet/>
[[File:Tollymore Forest Park, September 2010 (13).JPG|thumbnail|Shale rock with dark baslt bands along the edge of the river as it flows through Tollymore Forest Park]]
The bedrock of the upper part of the river, located in the Mourne Mountains, is composed of [[granite]] formed approximately 50 million years ago (mya).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/places_to_visit_home/aonb/aonb_mourne/aonb_mourne_geology.htm | title=Geology of Mourne AONB | publisher=DOE | date=25 January 2010 | accessdate=June 14, 2012}}</ref> The bedrock of the river as it flows through Tollymore is [[shale]] from the [[Silurian|Silurian age]], more than 400 mya, and it forms step gorges along some sections of the river banks. Dark bands of [[basalt]] are found were molten basalt [[lava]] was forced through cracks in the bedrock about 60 million years ago. The river bed contains stones and gravel from as far away as [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[Tyrone]] and [[Scotland]], which were carried there by glacial ice sheets during the last ice age.<ref>{{cite journal | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110628072210/http://habitas.org.uk/es2k/newsletter/Earth%20Science%20Ireland%20Issue%209.pdf||archivedate=28 June 2011|url=http://www.habitas.org.uk/es2k/newsletter/Earth%20Science%20Ireland%20Issue%209.pdf | title=Tollymore, more than just trees. | author=Kirk, David | journal=Earth Science Ireland |date=Spring 2011 | issue=9 | pages=7, 8 | ISSN=1753-5271}}</ref>

==Flooding==
There was major [[flood]]ing in the area on 16 and 17 August 2008 which was investigated by the [[Rivers Agency]], part of the  [[Department of Agriculture and Rural Development]] (DARD). Most of the flooding occurred along Bryansford Avenue and the Shimna Road, close to the Burren River and Shimna River [[confluence]], causing damage to approximately 40 properties. There is a history of flooding in Newcastle, particularly after heavy, sustained rainfall. The Rivers Agency had commissioned a [[Flood control#Control of floods|flood alleviation scheme]] along the nearby Burren River to reduce the risk of flooding in that area to 1 in 100 in any given year (national standards). This was completed in August 2007.<ref name="2008 flood report">{{cite | title=Newcastle August 2008 Flood Non Technical Flood Report | publisher=DARD Rivers Agency | publicationdate=September 2009 | accessdate=June 9, 2012}}</ref> There are no flood prevention measures in place along the Shimna River itself but in 2014 DARD commissioned a feasibility study for flood alleviation work to be carried out.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.downnews.co.uk/dard-rivers-agency-to-run-study-to-alleviate-flooding-from-shimna-river-in-newcastle/ | title=DARD Rivers Agency To Run Study To Alleviate Flooding From Shimna River In Newcastle | work=Down News | date=October 7, 2014 | accessdate=22 October 2014}}</ref>

The Rivers Agency concluded that the flooding was an extreme event, caused by weather that resulted in widespread flooding across Northern Ireland. The amount of water in the rivers exceeded the capacity of the flood defences and the natural [[river banks]]. They further concluded that the flooding was a result of overflow of the Shimna River into the Burren River [[Drainage basin|catchment area]] through Islands Park, rather than from the Burren River itself.<ref name="2008 flood report"/>

==Flora==
The river is nutrient-poor and acidic (pH 4.33) which determines the type of plant life found there. [[Moss]]es and [[liverwort]]s are the most common.<ref name="mandarin">{{cite journal | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25536032 | title=Abundance of a naturalized population of Mandarin duck ''Aix galericulata'' (L.) and the habitat suitability in the Shimna valley, co Down, Norther Ireland | author=Mathers, R. G. | journal=The Irish Naturalists' Journal | year=1996 | month=Oct | volume=25 | issue=8 | pages=280-285|subscription=yes|via=JSTOR}}</ref> Near the source [[Nardia|compressed flapwort]] (''Nardia compressa'') and [[green algae]] are the most dominant species. Closer to the mouth [[Scapania|water earwort]] (''Scapania undulata''), [[feather moss]] and [[Juncus|bulbous rush]] (''Juncus bulbosus'') are also found. Holt's mouse-tail moss (''Isothecium holtii'') is very common on the banks; the Shimna River is one of only three known sites for this species in Northern Ireland. It is also the only known location in Northern Ireland where Portuguese feather-moss (''Platyhypnidium alopecuroides'') is found.<ref name=doeni/>

Other notable species include:
*Rusty feather-moss (''Brachythecium plumosum'')
*Fox-tail feather-moss (''Thamnobryum alopecurum'')
*Yellow fringe-moss (''Racomitrium aciculare'')
*Overleaf pellia (''Pellia epiphylla'')

The most common trees found along the banks include [[oak]], beech (''[[Fagus sylvatica]]''), ash (''[[Fraxinus excelsior]]''), [[birch]] and [[willow]]. Rhododendron, [[Sambucus|elderberry]], blackberry, [[Laurus nobilis|laurel]] and ivy are also common along parts of the river.<ref name="mandarin"/>

==Fauna==

[[Atlantic salmon]], [[brown trout]] and sea trout use the river to [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]].<ref name =nidirect/> Other fish species found include [[Three-spined stickleback]], [[minnow]], [[stone loach]],  and eel.<ref name=doeni/> [[Dippers]] and [[Grey wagtail]]s can also be seen feeding on insects along the river.<ref name=leaflet/> Invertebrate species found include [[leech]]es, [[Simulidae]] and [[Ancylidae]]. Various Mayfly families are found, such as; [[Baetidae]], [[Ephemerellidae]], [[Heptageniidae]] and [[Caenidae]]. [[Stoneflies]] (Nemouridae, Chloroperlidae and Perlodidae families) and [[caddis]] larvae (Hydropsychidae, Polycentropidae, Rhyacophilidae and Limnephilidae families) are also present.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/riverrefcon.pdf | title=Reference Condition Descriptions for Northern Ireland River Types | accessdate=May 16, 2012}}

==Angling==
The river is partly owned by the [[Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure]] (DCAL) and partly leased by the Shimna Angling Club, and is managed by the latter club under a management agreement.  The principal fish are [[salmon]] and sea [[trout]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Fishing| work=Down District Council| url=http://www.downdc.gov.uk/Leisure---Culture/Tourism/Fishing.aspx | accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> The record for the largest sea trout in Ireland was set in 1983 when a 16lbs 6oz (7.43kg) fish was caught in the Shimna.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-28892750.html|    title=Specimen sea trout caught off Donegal | work=The Irish Times | date=June 13, 2011 | accessdate=16 October 2014 | author=Clancy, Paddy | subscription=yes | via=HighBeam}}</ref> Fishing season is from 1 March to 31 October.<ref name =nidirect>{{cite web | url=http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/angling-at-shimna-river | title=Key information about Shimna River | accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref>

==Pollution and fish kills==
There have been a number of incidents in recent years where the river has been polluted and fish have been killed. In 2004 a pipe was broken by builders while they were working on the upgrade of the Fofanny water treatment works, near the source of the river. This resulted in [[Siltation|sediment]] running into the river and the flooding of the plant. Fish were not directly harmed by this incident, and the [[Department for Regional Development|Water Service]] carried out an investigation to assure drinking water had not been affected. However, concerns were raised by the Shimna Anglers Club that this was not the first time building work had affected the river, and that there was the possibility of long term harm to the salmon and sea trout.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/3946599.stm | title=Investigation over river incident | work=BBC | date=23 October 2004 | accessdate=June 16, 2012}}</ref>

In July 2006, sewage discharge from a pumping station resulted in the death of an estimated 1,400 fish, mostly juveniles.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-10733705.html|    title=Water Service is under pressure to explain sewage leak | work=Belfast Telegraph | date=July 19, 2006 | accessdate=16 October 2014 | author=McAleese, Deborah | subscription=yes | via=HighBeam}}</ref> Brian Finn of the Fisheries Conservation Board suggested that there may have been only a small amount of sewage released but the high water temperatures and the low water levels caused by the warm weather at the time increased the fish's vulnerability to pollution.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/5187146.stm | title=River pollution kills 3,000 fish | work=BBC | date=17 July 2006 | accessdate=June 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-148555685.html|    title=Fish Die in River Sewage Spillage | work=The News Letter | date=July 18, 2006 | accessdate=16 October 2014 | author=Murray, Gemma | location=Belfast | subscription=yes | via=Highbeam}}</ref> The pollution led to the temporary closure of the boating lake and part of the beach near the mouth of the river.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-10734967.html|     title=Newcastle beach closed after discovery of raw sewage | work=Belfast Telegraph | date=July 18, 2006 | accessdate=20 October 2014 | author=Moulton, Emily | subscription=yes | via=HighBeam}}</ref>

In 2009 there was another major [[fish kill]], with over 200 dead fish found near the Fofanny water treatment works. There were approximately 150 trout and 55 salmon killed. The [[Northern Ireland Environment Agency]] investigated the incident and identified a potential source.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/environment/mourne-river-fish-kill-14503535.html?r=RSS | title=Mourne river fish kill | work=Belfast Telegraph | date=22 September 2009 | accessdate=June 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8267559.stm | title=Hundreds of fish are found dead | work=BBC | date=21 September 2009 | accessdate=June 16, 2012}}</ref> It was revealed that an emergency discharge was carried out at Fofanny Water Treatment Work from 5am to 7am, due to a generator failure. The discharge was stopped as soon as personnel arrived at the site. [[Northern Ireland Water]] claimed the discharge was necessary to maintain the drinking water supply from Fofanny damn. Measures have been since been put in place to prevent a similar incident in the future.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/carlingford___mourne_catchment_stakeholder_group_minutes_21st_october_2009.pdf | title=Meeting Record of the Carlingford & Mourne Catchment Stakeholder Group Meeting | publisher=DOE | date=21 October 2009 | accessdate=June 16, 2012}}</ref>

In 2010 a new [[fish counter]] was commissioned for the Shimna river and the initial results indicated that fish numbers had reached approximately 76% of the conservation limit (the number of fish required to spawn) in the 2010 season. This is an improvement from the estimated 12% in 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/salmon_conservation_-_public_consultation_-_scientific_and_technical_input.doc | title=Scientific and technical input to salmon conservation consultation | accessdate=June 16, 2012}}</ref> However, in 2014 concerns about salmon levels in the river were raised again after it was observed that the number of eggs being laid was still below conservation limits.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-35875196.html|     title=Fears as Salmon Fail to Return; Just Three in 100 That Migrate from River Bush Come Back to Spawn | work=Belfast Telegraph | date=April 1, 2014 | accessdate=16 October 2014 | author=Stewart, Linda | subscription=yes | via=Highbeam}}</ref>
