'''Luther Haden "Dummy" Taylor''' (February 21, 1875 <U+2013> August 22, 1958) was a [[deaf-mute]] American right-handed [[pitcher]] in [[Major League Baseball]] from 1900 to 1908. He played for the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]]<ref>Gannon, Jack. 1981. <i>Deaf Heritage<U+2013>A Narrative History of Deaf America</i>, Silver Spring, MD: National Association of the Deaf, p. 271 ([http://saveourdeafschools.org/Deaf_Heritage_by_Jack_Gannon_page_271.pdf PDF])</ref> and [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland Bronchos]] and was one of the key pitchers on the Giants' [[National League]] championship teams of 1904 and 1905.  

In 1901, his first full season in the major leagues, Taylor led the [[National League]] by [[pitcher|pitching]] in 45 games and ranked second in the league with 37 [[complete game]]s.  In 1904, he won 21 games for the Giants, and in 1906 his 2.20 ERA was the lowest on a pitching staff that also included [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Famers]] [[Christy Mathewson]] (2.97 ERA), and [[Joe McGinnity|"Iron Man" Joe McGinnity]] (2.25 ERA).  

Taylor was the first and only successful deaf pitcher in Major League Baseball and was regarded, along with [[Dummy Hoy]], as a role model and hero in the American deaf community in the early 20th century.<ref>Gannon, Jack. 1981. <i>Deaf Heritage<U+2013>A Narrative History of Deaf America</i>, Silver Spring, MD: National Association of the Deaf, pp. 291-294 ([http://saveourdeafschools.org/Deaf_Heritage_by_Jack_Gannon_page_293.pdf PDF])([http://saveourdeafschools.org/Deaf_Heritage_by_Jack_Gannon_page_294.pdf PDF])([http://saveourdeafschools.org/Deaf_Heritage_by_Jack_Gannon_page_291.pdf PDF])</ref>  In the 1900s, Taylor was reported to be the highest paid deaf person in the United States.  He was also known as the comedian of the Giants teams, waving a lit lantern when an umpire refused to call a game due to darkness and coaching at third base in rubber boots when an umpire refused to call a game due to rain.

In 2000, author Darryl Brock wrote the historical novel ''[[Havana Heat]]'' about Taylor's experience in professional baseball.  The book won the [[Dave Moore Award]] in 2000 as the "most important baseball book" published that year.<ref>[http://www.efqreview.com/NewFiles/dm2000winner.html Elysian Fields Quarterly website]</ref>

==Early years==
Taylor was born in [[Oskaloosa, Kansas]] in 1875.  He was the son of Arnold B. Taylor, a farmer, and his wife, Emaline (Chatman) Taylor.  At the time of the [[1880 United States Census]], Taylor was living in rural [[Jefferson County, Kansas]] with his parents, two older brothers, and two older sisters.<ref name=C80/>  Some accounts indicate that Taylor was born deaf.<ref name=TGE>{{cite book|author=Tom Schott, Nick Peters|title=The Giants Encyclopedia|page=241|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2003|isbn=}}</ref>  However, at age four, Taylor was not listed as being "[[deaf and dumb]]" or otherwise handicapped in the family's U.S. Census record.<ref name=C80>Census entry for Arnold B.

Taylor continued to live at the Kansas School for the Deaf through his high school years.  He was a pitcher for the school baseball team and also participated in boxing.  Interviewed in 1942, Taylor recalled that he had dreams as a boy of becoming a great boxer, but his parents objected.<ref name=TSN>{{cite news|author=Harold W.

==Semi-pro and minor league baseball==
After leaving the Kansas School for the Deaf, Taylor began playing semi-pro baseball with a team in [[Nevada, Missouri]].  He then played at [[Lincoln, Illinois]], and with minor league teams in [[Wabash, Indiana|Wabash]], [[Crawfordsville, Indiana|Crawfordsville]], [[Danville, Indiana|Danville]] and [[Terre Haute, Indiana]].  In 1897, he played for a minor league team in [[Mattoon, Illinois]].  He played for the Shreveport Tigers of the [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]] in 1898 and 1899.<ref name=TSN/>

In 1900, Taylor began the season playing for [[Albany, New York]].  At the time of the [[1900 United States Census|U.S. Census]] in June 1900, Taylor was residing at a boarding house in Albany; his occupation was listed as a printer.<ref>Census entry for Luther Taylor, age 24, born in Kansas.

==Major League Baseball==
===First stint with Giants===
In August 1900, Taylor was called up to the major leagues to play for the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]].  He made his major league debut on August 27, 1900.  In his first game for the Giants, five Boston players tried to take advantage of Taylor's deafness by trying to steal third base.  Interviewed in 1942, Taylor recalled with pride, "I nailed each one.  I walked over to [[Herman Long (baseball)|(Herman) Long]], the last man caught, and let him know by signs I could hear him stealing."<ref name=TSN/>  Appearing in 11 games for the 1900 Giants, Taylor compiled a 4<U+2013>3 record with a 2.45 [[earned run average]] (ERA).<ref name=BR>{{cite web|title=Dummy Taylor|publisher=baseball-reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/t/taylodu01.shtml}}</ref>

In his second season in the major leagues, Taylor was a workhorse for the [[1901 New York Giants season|1901 Giants]].  He led the [[National League]] with 43 games started and by appearing in a total of 45 games.  He also ranked second in the league with 37 complete games, 353<U+2153> innings pitched, and 1,518 batters faced.<ref name=BR/>  Despite maintaining a respectable 3.18 ERA, Taylor played for a weak-hitting Giants team that finished 7th out of 8 teams in hits and runs produced.<ref>{{cite web|title=1901 New York Giants|publisher=baseball-reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYG/1901.shtml}}</ref>  With the absence of run support, Taylor finished the season with a win-loss record of 18<U+2013>27.  His 27 losses in 1901 is tied for the second most given up by any pitcher in Major League Baseball during the 20th century (trailing [[Vic Willis]]'s 29 losses in 1905).<ref>{{cite web|title=Single-Season Leaders & Records for Losses|publisher=baseball-reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/L_season.shtml}}</ref>

===Cleveland Bronchos===
In March 1902, Taylor signed for more money with the [[Cleveland Bronchos]] of the [[American League]].<ref name=TGE/>  He recalled that American League teams were "waving big money at us" in the winter before the 1902 season.<ref name=TSN/>  Taylor appeared in four games for the Bronchos, all as a starter.  Despite a 1.59 ERA, Taylor again suffered from a lack of run support and compiled a record of 1<U+2013>3 in Cleveland.<ref name=BR/>

===Second stint with Giants===
In May 1902, the Giants sent catcher [[Frank Bowerman]] to persuade Taylor to return to the Giants.<ref name=TGE/><ref>{{cite news|title=Taylor to Play with New York|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 8, 1902|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F20E1EFE385412738DDDA10894DD405B828CF1D3}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=CUNNING OF "DUMMY" TAYLOR: Hemphill Tells Story of How He Was Shaken the Night Bowerman Kidnaped the Mute Twirler|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=April 26, 1903|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/407128971.html?dids=407128971:407128971&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Apr+26%2C+1903&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=CUNNING+OF+%22DUMMY%22+TAYLOR.&pqatl=google}}</ref>  Bowerman sat in the stands while Taylor was pitching and negotiated the terms of Taylor's return to the Giants by signing.  Taylor recalled: <blockquote>Frank sat in the grandstand and every time I walked out to the pitching mound he kept talking to me with his fingers.  I kept shaking my head "No," and Frank kept boosting the money.  Soon, I nodded my head "Yes," and that night I was on my way back to New York with Frank.<ref name=TSN/></blockquote>
Taylor appeared in 26 games for the 1902 Giants and had 22 complete games.  Taylor's 7<U+2013>15 record for the 1902 Giants was again the result of playing for a remarkably weak-hitting team, as the 1902 Giants finished in last place in runs, hits and batting average.<ref name=NYG02>{{cite web|title=1902 New York Giants|publisher=baseball-reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYG/1902.shtml}}</ref>  Even [[Christy Mathewson]], who was Taylor's teammate on the 1902 Giants, registered a losing record in 1902 with an ERA (2.12) only marginally better than Taylor.<ref name=NYG02/>

In 1903, [[John McGraw]] took over as the manager of the Giants.  McGraw quickly turned the Giants into one of the best teams in the National League, with Taylor, Mathewson, and [[Joe McGinnity|Iron Man Joe McGinnity]] as his pitching stars.  Taylor had his most successful season in 1904.  With strong support from a Giants team that finished first in the National League in runs and hits, Taylor compiled a 21<U+2013>15 record in 1904.  He was among the National League leaders that year with 21 wins (4th), five shutouts (3rd), 1.033 [[Walks plus hits per inning pitched|WHIP]] (5th), 136 strikeouts (6th), and a .991 fielding percentage (2nd).<ref name=BR/>

In 1905, Taylor helped lead the Giants to their second consecutive National League pennant.  Taylor appeared in 32 games and compiled a record of 16<U+2013>9 with a 2.66 ERA.<ref name=BR/>  Taylor was scheduled to pitch in the third game of the [[1905 World Series]], but the game was cancelled because of rain, and Christy Mathewson was able to pitch with an extra day of rest when the Series resumed.<ref name=KHOF/> (Mathewson pitched three complete-game shutouts in the 1905 World Series.)

Although the Giants fell short of a third consecutive pennant in 1906, Taylor had another strong year,  compiling a 17<U+2013>9 record and a 2.20 ERA.  His 1906 ERA was the lowest on a pitching staff that also included [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]]rs Christy Mathewson (2.97 ERA) and Iron Man Joe McGinnity (2.25 ERA).<ref>{{cite web|title=1906 New York Giants|publisher=baseball-reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYG/1906.shtml}}</ref> Taylor also ranked 6th in the National League with a .654 winning percentage in 1906.<ref name=BR/>

In 1907, Taylor went 11<U+2013>7 with a 2.42 ERA and a 1.117 WHIP.  He pitched his final major league season in 1908, compiling an 8<U+2013>5 record with a 2.33 ERA.<ref name=BR/>

===Minor leagues===
In February 1909, Taylor was sold to the [[Buffalo Bisons]] in the [[International League#History|Eastern League]].<ref>{{cite news|title='Dummy' Taylor Sold to Buffalo|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 3, 1909|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F00B13FB3B5512738DDDAA0894DA405B898CF1D3}}</ref>  He won 32 games for Buffalo in 1909 and 1910 and played in the minor leagues from 1909 to 1915. In his final season of organized baseball, he compiled an 18<U+2013>11 record for the [[Utica Utes]] in the [[New York State League]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Dummy Taylor Minor League Statistics|publisher=baseball-reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=taylor001lut}}</ref>

===Overall record===
In nine seasons in the major leagues, Taylor compiled an overall win-loss record of 116<U+2013>106 and 767 strikeouts.  He threw 237 complete games and 21 shutouts.  He had a career ERA of 2.75 and a career WHIP of 1.267.<ref name=BR/>

===Hearing impairment===
Taylor was [[profoundly deaf]] and communicated on-field with his teammates in [[sign language]].  He is credited with helping to expand and make universal the use of sign language throughout the modern baseball infield, including but not limited to the use of [[list of baseball jargon (S)#sign|pitching sign]]s.  According to Sean Lahman in his biography of Taylor, "The Giants didn't just add Taylor to their roster; they embraced him as a member of the family.  Player-manager [[George Davis]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=September 2011}}  learned sign language and encouraged his players to do the same.  John McGraw did likewise when he took over as Giants manager in July 1902."<ref name=Lahman>{{cite web|title=Dummy Taylor|publisher=Deaf Biography|author=Sean Lahman|url=http://deafbiography.com/biography/dummytaylorbio.htm}}</ref>  In [[Lawrence Ritter]]'s ''[[The Glory of Their Times]]'', Taylor's teammate, [[Fred Snodgrass]], recalled:<blockquote>We could all read and speak the deaf-and-dumb sign language, because Dummy Taylor took it as an affront if you didn't learn to converse with him.  He wanted to be one of us, to be a full-fledged member of the team.  If we went to the vaudeville show, he wanted to know what the joke was, and somebody had to tell him.  So we all learned.  We practiced all the time.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lawrence S. Ritter|title=The Glory of Their Times|page=101|publisher=Harper Collins|date=1966}}</ref></blockquote>

During his eight seasons in Major League Baseball, Taylor's success won acclaim in the deaf press, including ''The Silent Worker'', and he became a role model and hero for the deaf community.<ref name=Burch>{{cite book|author=Susan Burch|title=Signs of Resistance: American Deaf Cultural History, 1900 to World War II|pages=80<U+2013>81|publisher=NYU Press|year=2004|isbn=0814798942}}</ref>  An article in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' noted that "wherever Taylor goes he will always be visited by scores of the silent fraternity among whom he is regarded as a prodigy."<ref name=RARE/>

On May 16, 1902, Taylor pitched against [[Dummy Hoy]] in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio.  The occasion was reported to be "the first and only time two deaf professional athletes competed against one another."<ref name=TGE/>  When Hoy came to bat for the first time, he signed to Taylor, "I'm glad to see you."<ref name=Burch/>  Hoy collected two hits off Taylor, but Taylor got the win as the Giants beat the [[Cincinnati Reds|Reds]] 5<U+2013>3.<ref name=TGE/><ref>{{cite book|author=Rebecca Goodman, Barrett J. Brunsman|title=This Day In Ohio History|page=154|publisher=Emmis Books|year=2004|isbn=1578601916}}</ref>

Taylor's nickname, "Dummy," was commonly applied to "deaf and dumb" baseball players in the late 19th and early 20th century.  [[Ed Dundon|Dummy Dundon]] and Dummy Hoy were the first professional baseball players to receive the appellation.  Others include [[Dummy Deegan]], [[Dummy Leitner]], [[Dummy Lynch]], [[Dummy Murphy]] and [[Dummy Stephenson]].  Although he accepted the nickname in his playing days, Taylor noted in a 1945 interview that he and Dummy Hoy did not care for the nickname: "In the old days Hoy and I were called Dummy.  It didn't hurt us.  It made us fight harder."<ref name=RARE>{{cite book|author=R.A.R. Edwards|title=No Dummies: Deafness, Baseball and American Culture|work=The Cooperstown Symposium on Baseball and American Culture, 2007<U+2013>2008|publisher=McFarland|year=2009|pages=120<U+2013>129|isbn=0786435690}}</ref>  Taylor's popularity led to an outcry in the deaf press against the use of the nickname.  [[Alexander Pach]] wrote an editorial in ''The Silent Worker'' in which he protested: "The highest salaried deaf man in the United States is the much heralded Dummy Taylor<U+2014>I say Dummy only to serve to show how contemptible the epithet looks."<ref name=RARE/>

Taylor was inducted into the American Athletic Association of the Deaf Hall of Fame in 1953.  He was also inducted into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame in 2006.<ref name=KHOF>{{cite web|title=Hall of Fame Inductees: Taylor, Luther 'Dummy'|publisher=Kansas Sports Hall of Fame|url=http://www.kshof.org/siteresources/apps/records/halloffamer.asp?id=159}}</ref>

===Reputation for clowning===
Taylor also developed a reputation as the clown on the Giants' team of the 1900s.  In April 1905, ''The New York Times'' wrote about Taylor's efforts to maintain a light atmosphere in the Giants' locker room.  The ''Times'' described Taylor's post-shower wrestling matches with Frank Bowerman and his displays of the Japanese martial art, [[Jujutsu|jiu-jitsu]], adding:<blockquote>The "Dummy" is always smiling.  No matter whether in the dressing room or on the practice field he is the clown of the crowd.  If a joke is told he makes Bowerman repeat it to him with his fingers.  Then he emits a cacophonous cackle that passes for a laugh.  "It is a good thing Taylor can't tell stories," remarked McGraw one morning, "or I never should be able to get any work out of you fellows."<ref>{{cite news|title=At a Dress Rehearsal of the Champion Giants |newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 16, 1905|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F50C13F93C5C1A728DDDAF0994DC405B858CF1D3|first=Edwin|last=Tracey}}</ref></blockquote>

On one occasion, Taylor disagreed with the decision by umpire [[Bill Klem]] not to call the game as darkness fell. Taylor returned to the clubhouse and came back onto the field wearing a fireman's oilskin and holding a lit lantern above his head.  Klem yelled at Taylor to get off the field, but Taylor could not hear and continued with his antics until Klem finally called the game.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dummy Taylor Once Halted Game With Lantern, Oilskin|author=Harlan W. Nichols|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate|date=May 6, 1954|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yccdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VloEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4619,3072032&dq=dummy-taylor&hl=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='Dummy' Taylor's Dramatics Didn't Go Over With Umpire|newspaper=The News-Dispatch|date=May 6, 1954|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hnhYAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EEINAAAAIBAJ&pg=1306,2459478&dq=dummy-taylor&hl=en}}</ref>

[[Honus Wagner]] later wrote about a game in which the Giants were complaining about the umpire's refusal to suspend a game due to rain.  Wagner wrote, "So Dummy Taylor, one of the Giant pitchers, went out to the third base coaching lines in his hip boots and a raincoat.  Then the umpire did get mad.  He chased Taylor out of the park, and it was funny to see Dummy trying to explain to him that he shouldn't be ejected."<ref>{{cite news|author=Honus Wagner|title=Rookies Ran the Gauntlet|newspaper=The Telegraph-Herald|date=March 6, 1936|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tONBAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4akMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3032,4044063&dq=dummy-taylor&hl=en}}</ref>  Taylor later recalled that the umpire, Johnston, "not only chased me, but declared the game forfeited to the other club."<ref name=TSN/>

Giants' manager McGraw kept Taylor in the dugout when he wasn't pitching to distract the opposing pitcher.  Taylor was able to emit a "rattling shriek" just as the opposing pitcher was about to release a pitch.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank Deford|title=The Old Ball Game: How John McGraw, Christy Mathewson, and the New York Giants Created Modern Baseball|page=70|publisher=Grove Press|year=2006|isbn=0802142478}}</ref> Teammate [[Mike Donlin]] compared the noise to the "crazed shrieking of a jackass."<ref name=Lahman/>  Taylor biographer Sean Lahman wrote: "Umpire [[Charlie Zimmer]] once got so irritated with the shrill sound that he ejected Taylor, perhaps the only instance of a deaf player being tossed for being too noisy."<ref name=Lahman/>

Taylor was also ejected from a baseball game by an umpire "for cursing him out in sign language."<ref>{{cite book|author=Floyd Conner|title=Baseball's Most Wanted|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|year=2000|isbn=1574882295}}</ref>  According to some accounts, the umpire was [[Hank O'Day]], who knew sign language.<ref name=TGE/>  After Taylor's tirade, O'Day reportedly stepped in front of the plate and signed the following comments back at Taylor: "Listen, smart guy&nbsp;... I've spent all my spare time this past week learning your language.  You can't call me a blind bat any more.  Now, go take a shower&nbsp;... you're out of the game."<ref name=BD>{{cite news|author=Sam Molen|title=Signing Off|newspaper=Baseball Digest|date=May 1953|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=My4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA64&dq=%22dummy+taylor%22&hl=en&ei=qVFZTvfhBdTTiALGrZGvCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22dummy%20taylor%22&f=false}}</ref>  

Aside from sign language, Taylor would let it be known that he disagreed with an umpire's call by holding his nose and spinning the second finger of his other hand near his temple, demonstrating his belief that the ump was screwy.<ref name=TSN/>  In June 1905, umpire [[Hank O'Day]] ejected Taylor for hand gestures that he interpreted to be an accusation that "I had wheels in my head."<ref name=MD/>  A press account described the scene:<blockquote>He strode angrily toward O'Day, and the grandstand observed a lightning movement of the hands.  Mystic symbol followed mystic symbol, and the crowd kept guessing, what it meant.  Suddenly O'Day, too, strode forward and majestically waved Mr. Taylor from the field.  Still frantically making rotary movements around his temples, "Dummy" dawdled away."<ref name=MD>{{cite news|title=Taylor and O'Day What Dummy Said|newspaper=The Meriden Daily Journal|date=June 21, 1905|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ubRIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1AENAAAAIBAJ&pg=3865,3281793&dq=dummy-taylor&hl=en}}</ref></blockquote>

John McGraw recalled an occasion when he, too, was cursed out by Taylor: "In sign language, Dummy consigned me to the hottest place he could think of<U+2014>and he didn't mean St. Louis."<ref name=RARE/>  Taylor was also an accomplished juggler and would often put on "a grand juggling act" in front of the Giants' dugout to amuse the fans.<ref>{{cite news|title=Polo Ground Memories|author=John Kieran|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 13, 1936|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB0D1EF83C59167B93C1A81783D85F428385F9}}</ref>

==Later years==
After his retirement from baseball, Taylor returned to Olathe and the Kansas State School For the Deaf, where he worked as a teacher and coach.  He also served as an umpire from 1915 to 1920, working games for the [[House of David (commune)#Baseball_teams|House of David]] and [[Gilkerson's Union Giants|Union Giants]].<ref name=TSN/>  As of January 1914, he was the physical director at the Kansas School for the Deaf.<ref>{{cite news|title=Federal League Not Coming To New York|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 3, 1914|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F10916FB345F13738DDDAA0894D9405B848DF1D3}}</ref>  At the time of the 1915 Kansas State Census, he was living in Olathe with his wife, Della M.
