'''SS ''Empire Simba''''' was a British [[steam turbine|steam]]-powered [[cargo ship]]. She was originally an [[United States|American]] ship, [[ship naming and launching|launched]] in 1918 as '''SS ''West Cohas'''''. During a stint in the [[United States Navy]] from 1918 to 1919, she was known as '''USS ''West Cohas'' (ID-3253)'''.

''West Cohas'' was built in 1918 for the {{USSB|first=long}} as part of the ''West'' boats, a series of steel-[[hull (watercraft)|hull]]ed cargo ships built on the [[West Coast of the United States]] for the [[World War I]] war effort. She was the 24th ship built by [[Skinner & Eddy]] of [[Seattle, Washington]], and was completed in 88 calendar days. She was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the {{NOTS|first=long}} of the [[United States Navy]] as USS ''West Cohas'' (ID-3253) in June 1918. After several overseas trips for the Navy, she was decommissioned in May 1919 and returned to the {{USSB}}.

''West Cohas'' ran aground off [[Sable Island]] in 1925 while trying to assist a vessel in distress, but otherwise had a relatively uneventful merchant career for the {{USSB}}. In 1933, she was sold to the [[Lykes Brothers Steamship Company]]. In 1939, she collided with the [[Ireland|Irish]] passenger ship ''Munster'', which damaged both vessels. In June 1940, ''West Cobalt'' was sold to British interests and renamed ''Empire Simba''.

During convoy service in [[World War II]], ''Empire Simba'' initially sailed between the United Kingdom and [[North America]] carrying cargos of scrap iron from the United States. She was bombed by a German aircraft on 1 March and abandoned. She was towed to port for repairs but was struck by a German [[land mine]] dropped in a bombing raid. After six months of repairs, she began sailing roundtrips to [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]]. On one return voyage to the UK in July 1944, she collided with another ship in the convoy. After splitting the rest of the war between voyages to North America and [[Africa]], ''Empire Simba'' was loaded with [[chemical weapons]] in August 1945 and [[scuttle]]d west of Ireland.

== Design and construction ==
The ''West'' ships were [[cargo ship]]s of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the [[West Coast of the United States]] for the {{USSB|first=long}} for emergency use during [[World War I]]. All were given names that began with the word ''West'', like ''West Cohas'',<ref name=CW-358>Crowell and Wilson, pp. 358<U+2013>59.</ref> one of some 24 ''West'' ships built by [[Skinner & Eddy]] of [[Seattle, Washington]].<ref name=Colton /><ref group=Note>Skinner & Eddy was an emergency shipyard that only operated from 1916 until about 1920.</ref>

''West Cohas'' (Skinner & Eddy No. 24, {{USSB}} No. 1177)<ref name=Colton /> was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 4 May 1918 and delivered to the [[United States Navy]] upon completion later in the month.<ref name=DANFS /><ref name=Miramar /> ''West Cohas'' was built in a total of 73 working days, 88 calendar days,<ref name=S&E /> and was listed in seventh place on a list of the ten fastest constructed ocean-going vessels compiled in 1920.<ref name=Hurley>Hurley, pp. 92<U+2013>93. Hurley, however, reports ''West Cohas''{{'}}s construction time as 85 calendar days. Skinner & Eddy's number of 89 days would put ''West Cohas'' at number nine on the list.</ref> Skinner & Eddy received a $64,000 bonus for completing the ship early.<ref>Shipping Board Operations, p. 624.</ref> 

The ship was {{GRT|5,647|first=yes}},<ref name=Miramar /> and was {{convert|409|ft|5|in|m}} long ([[length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]]) and {{convert|54|ft|m|1}} [[beam (nautical)|abeam]].<!-- LPP --><ref name=Miramar /><ref name=DANFS /><!-- beam --> ''West Cohas'' had a steel [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] and a [[mean]] [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|24|ft|2|in|m}}.<ref name=DANFS /> She [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] 12,225 t,<ref name=DANFS /> and had a [[deadweight tonnage]] of {{DWT|8,554}}.<ref name=CW-595>Crowell and Wilson, p. 595.</ref> The ship had a single [[steam turbine]] that drove her single [[screw propeller]], and moved the ship at a {{convert|10.5|knots|km/h|adj=on}} pace.<ref name=DANFS />

== Military career ==
USS ''West Cohas'' (ID-3253) was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the {{NOTS|first=long}} on 4 June with [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] W. F. Andrews, [[United States Naval Reserve Forces|USNRF]], in command. After successfully completing [[sea trial]]s, ''West Cohas'' sailed for [[Arica]], [[Chile]], to carry a load of [[nitrate]]s to the United States. Sailing from Arica on 29 July, ''West Cohas'' transited the [[Panama Canal]] and arrived at [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where she unloaded the cargo. She sailed up the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] to [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where she arrived on 25 September. After taking on a full load of [[mat<U+00E9>riel]] for the [[American Expeditionary Force]] in [[France]], she sailed on 9 October for [[Brest, France]], where she arrived on 28 October. While in port discharging her cargo, the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]] was signed on 11 November, ending the fighting. She sailed for the United States ten days later.<ref name=DANFS />

[[Image:Crew of USS West Cohas (ID-3253), 1919.jpg|thumb|left|The officers and men of USS ''West Cohas'' pose on the ship's [[superstructure]] in 1919.]]
After her return, ''West Cohas'' made two post-war more voyages to [[La Pallice]], France.<ref name=DANFS /> She was employed as a [[transport]] during her return trips to the United States. Though specific information about the number of troops ''West Cohas'' carried (or was capable of carrying) is unknown, {{SS|West Arrow}}, a Skinner & Eddy-constructed sister ship, carried 23 men on at least one voyage.<ref name=CW-595 /> She returned to Norfolk on 5 May at the conclusion of her second voyage where she was decommissioned 4 days later and returned to the {{USSB}}.<ref name=DANFS />

== Civilian career ==
After her return to the {{USSB|first=long}}, ''West Cohas'' sailed on a France <U+2013> [[Southampton]] <U+2013> [[New York City|New York]] route through 1920.<ref>{{cite web | title = West Cohas | url = http://www.ellisisland.org/shipping/Formatship.asp?shipid=2629 | publisher = The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, Inc. | year = 2000 | accessdaymonth = 22 September | accessyear = 2008 }}</ref> In September 1919, ''West Grama'' carried 56<U+00A0>passengers from [[Bassens]] to New York.<ref name=Ellis />

Little is known about ''West Cohas''{{'}}s subsequent civilian career until 1925. In July of that year, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' carried a news report that ''West Cohas'' had run aground on shoals off [[Sable Island]]. The French fishing [[trawler]] ''Labrador'' had run aground on the shoals on the morning of 19 July and had issued a [[SOS|distress call]]. The nearby ''West Cohas'' steamed to her aid, but became stranded on the rocks nearby and issued her own distress call. Lifesaving crews had been dispatched but could reach neither ship because of fog and waves. At press time the [[Canada|Canadian]] government [[buoy tender]] and several [[tug]]s were reported on their way  to aid both ships.<ref>{{cite news | author = Associated Press | title = Steamer strikes shoal seeking stranded ship | work = The Washington Post | date = 20 July 1925 | page = 5 }}</ref> There were no follow up reports to indicate how much damage ''West Cohas'' sustained, but she escaped the fate of the {{GRT|399}} ''Labrador'', which was a total loss.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.miramarshipindex.org.nz/ship/show/187645 | title = Labrador | work = Miramar Ship Index | publisher = R.B.Haworth | accessdaymonth = 22 September | accessyear = 2008 }}</ref> ''West Cohas'' had been repaired and was back in service by November 1926, when ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that she was to begin service carrying grain from [[Galveston, Texas]], to [[London]].<ref name=WSJ-texas />

In 1933, ''West Cohas'' was sold to the [[Lykes Brothers Steamship Company]], which assigned her to its Ripley Steamship Company subsidiary.<ref name=Mariners>{{cite web | title = The 'Empire' ships: M | url = http://www.mariners-l.co.uk/EmpireS.html | work = Mariners | publisher = Ted Finch | date = 14 June 2001 | accessdaymonth = 22 September | accessyear = 2008 }}</ref> During the 1930s, Lykes Brothers primarily operated cargo ships between [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] and [[Caribbean]] ports,<ref>{{cite web | last = Kleiner | first = Diana J | title = Lykes Brothers | url = http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/LL/etlzz.html | work = [[Handbook of Texas|Handbook of Texas Online]] | accessdaymonth = 20 September | accessyear = 2008 }}</ref> and, though there is little specific information available regarding ''West Cohas''{{'}}s movements, it is likely that she called at Gulf coast and Caribbean ports for portions of her Lykes Brothers career. In July 1938, she was sailing from [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] to [[Liverpool]] when she rammed the [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Motor Vessel|motor vessel]] ''Munster'' {{convert|15|nmi|km}} north of [[Dublin]]. ''Munster'', with 200<U+00A0>passengers aboard, was damaged on her [[starboard]] side, while ''West Cohas''{{'}}s bow was twisted from the impact. Both vessels made it to Liverpool without loss of life.<ref>{{cite news | title = U. S. steamer is in collision | work = Chicago Daily Tribune | date = 20 July 1938 | page = 7 }}</ref>

== World War II ==
On 21 June 1940, Lykes Brothers sold ''West Cohas'' to British interests for transfer to British registry. The crew for the newly British ship was shipped from Liverpool on the [[Cunard Line]] ocean liner on {{RMS|Scythia||2}} to New York via [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] and bussed to Galveston, Texas, to take possession of the ship. Sailing from that port, they took on a load of scrap iron and headed for [[Bermuda]].<!-- destination --><ref name=CPDB-Cohas>{{cite web | title = Port Arrivals/Departures: West Cobalt | url = http://convoyweb.org.uk/ports/index.html?search.php?vessel=WEST+COHAS~armain | work = Arnold Hague's Ports Database | publisher = Convoy Web | date = | accessdaymonth = 22 September | accessyear = 2008 }}</ref><ref name=Harrison>{{cite web | last = Harrison | first = David | title = Empire Simba | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/69/a4197369.shtml | work = WW2 People's War: An archive ofWorld War Two memories <U+2013> written by the public, gathered by the BBC | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 15 June 2005 | accessdaymonth = 22 September | accessyear = 2008 }}</ref><!-- cargo of scrap iron --> At Bermuda, ''West Cohas'' joined a convoy to Halifax and then on to Liverpool.

''West Cohas'' sailed for [[Methil]] five days later and arrived on 1 September.<ref name=CPDB-Cohas />

Transferred to the [[Ministry of War Transport]] and renamed ''Empire Simba'', the ship was assigned to Andrew Weir & Co. of London for operation.<ref name=Mariners /> After spending six weeks at Methil, where she had an advanced [[ship degaussing]] system installed among other repairs,<ref name=Harrison /> ''Empire Simba'' set

The ship continued to take a beating from heavy seas which opened the number one cargo hold to the ocean. Because the water was coming in faster than the [[bilge pump]]s in the hold number one could pump. The crew cut through the bulkheads into cargo hold number two to double the pumping capacity and were able to keep the ship under control long enough to arrive in Bermuda on 26 December. After temporary repairs were made there, ''Empire Simba'' sailed on 6 January 1942 first to Halifax and then to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] for more permanent repairs.<ref name=Harrison /><ref name=CPDB /><!-- dates -->

After two weeks in Baltimore, ''Empire Simba'' headed to [[Hampton Roads, Virginia]], to take on another load of scrap iron for the UK. After making her way to Halifax by early February, she sailed on 9 February as a part of Convoy HX-108,<ref>{{cite AHCD | convoytype = HX | convoynumber = 108 | accessdaymonth = 22 September | accessyear = 2008 }}</ref> but dropped out and joined up with Convoy SC-22,<ref name=CPDB /> a slower convoy that had left Halifax a day earlier.<ref>{{cite AHCD | convoytype = SC | convoynumber = 22 | accessdaymonth = 22 September | accessyear = 2008 }}</ref> Off the [[Northern Ireland]] coast, the convoy escorts broke off and ''Empire Simba'' and three other ships sailed into the [[Irish Sea]]. Headed to her destination of [[Port Talbot]], ''Empire Simba'' was at the back of the line of the four ships. At 13:00 on 1 March, a [[Nazi Germany|German]] bomber attacked the column and had a near miss on ''Empire Simba''. The force of the explosion shattered the main water injection pipe in the engine room, flooding her engine room and leaving the ship dead in the water. The German bomber, with smoke trailing from it after being hit by bullets from one of ''Empire Simba''{{'}}s two [[Hotchkiss M1909 Benet-Mercie machine gun|Hotchkiss Mark I]] machine guns, headed off for [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. There were no towing vessels immediately available for ''Empire Simba'', so as darkness approached, ''Empire Simba''{{'}}s crew abandoned the ship for the escorting [[naval trawler|trawler]]. Taking the ship's two machine guns, the [[chronometer]], and some personal belongings, the crew were landed at [[Milford Haven]]. ''Empire Simba'' was saved and towed into [[Birkenhead]], where the officers rejoined with their erstwhile ship. During an overnight bombing raid on the night of 12/13 March, German bombers parachuted [[land mine]]s on Birkenhead. One landed on ''Empire Simba'' and exploded, causing significant damage to the ship.<ref name=Harrison />

By mid-August 1941, ''Empire Simba'' , with a completely new crew,<ref name=Harrison /> had been repaired enough to set out in a Liverpool <U+2013> [[Freetown]] convoy, but evidently returned to Liverpool the same day. After making her way to Oban on 9 September, she began the first of seven roundtrips to Freetown over the next 18<U+00A0>months.<ref name=CPDB /> Twice, when setting out with convoys, ''Empire Simba'' had to return to port with unspecified problems.<ref>{{cite AHCD | convoytype = OS | convoynumber = 19 | accessdaymonth = 22 September | accessyear = 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite AHCD | convoytype = SL | convoynumber = 114 | accessdaymonth = 22 September | accessyear = 2008 }}</ref> In a third convoy sailing, a problem with her steering gear caused her to collide with another convoy ship, ''Empire Scott'',<ref>Hutson, p. 85.</ref>and on 1 August, ''Empire Simba'' straggled and dropped out of the convoy.<ref>{{cite AHCD | convoytype = OS | convoynumber = 19 | accessdaymonth = 22 September | accessyear = 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite AHCD | convoytype = SL | convoynumber = 116 | accessdaymonth = 22 September | accessyear = 2008 }}</ref>

In February and March 1944, ''Empire Simba'' made an extended roundtrip from the UK to Gibraltar. During this time, she called at [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] and [[Burriana]] in neutral [[Spain]] on 15 and 18 March, respectively. Between April 1944 and June 1945 she made four transatlantic crossings, interrupted by another trip to Freetown in December 1944.<ref name=CPDB /> By August 1945, ''Empire Simba'' was at anchor in the harbor of [[Cairn Ryan]] in the west of [[Scotland]]. There she was loaded with 8,000<U+00A0>tons<!-- source did not specify what type of tons --> of [[chemical weapon]]s that had been stockpiled for use if the Germans had used chemical weapons first.<ref name=Times /> On 11 September, ''Empire Simba'' was [[scuttle]]d at location {{coord|55|12|N|11|0|W|display=inline,title}}.<ref name=Miramar />
