'''''Cyclura nubila''''', also known as the '''Cuban rock iguana''', '''Cuban ground iguana''',  or '''Cuban iguana''',<ref name=hollingsworth/> is a species of [[lizard]] of the [[iguana]] family. It is the largest of the West Indian [[cyclura|rock iguanas]] (genus ''Cyclura''), one of the most [[endangered species|endangered]] groups of lizards. This [[herbivore|herbivorous]] species with red eyes, a thick tail, and spiked jowls is one of the largest lizards in the [[Caribbean]].

The Cuban iguana is distributed throughout the [[Cuban cactus scrub|rocky southern coastal areas]] of mainland [[Cuba]] and its surrounding islets with a [[feral]] population thriving on Isla Magueyes, [[Puerto Rico]]. It is also found on the [[Cayman Islands]] of [[Little Cayman]] and [[Cayman Brac]], where a separate [[subspecies]] occurs. Females guard their nest sites and often nest in sites excavated by [[Cuban Crocodile|Cuban crocodile]]s. As a defense measure, the Cuban iguana often makes its home within or near prickly-pear cacti.

Although the wild population is in decline because of [[predation]] by [[feral]] animals and habitat loss caused by human agricultural development, the numbers of iguanas have been bolstered as a result of captive-breeding and other conservation programs. ''Cyclura nubila'' has been used to study evolution and [[animal communication]], and its captive-breeding program has been a model for other endangered lizards in the Caribbean.

==Diet==
Like all ''Cyclura'' species, the Cuban iguana is primarily [[herbivorous]]; 95% of its diet consists of the leaves, flowers and fruits from as many as 30 plant species, including the seaside rock shrub (''[[Rachicallis]] [[Rachicallis americana|americana]]''), thistle, prickly pear (''[[Opuntia stricta]]''), black mangrove (''[[Avicennia germinans]]''), red mangrove (''[[Rhizophora mangle]]''), olives, and various grasses.<ref name=isg2>{{Cite journal|last= Thorbjarnarson|first=John|title=Observations on the Population of ''Cyclura nubila nubila'' Inhabiting the Mount Cabaniguan Wildlife Refuge, Las Tunas, Cuba|journal= Iguana Specialist Group Newsletter|volume=7|issue=1|pages=10<U+2013>12|date=May 26, 2004|url=http://www.iucn-isg.org/newsletters/pdf/ISG_News_7(1).pdf|format=PDF

Like other herbivorous lizards, the Cuban iguana is presented with a problem for [[osmoregulation]]: plant matter contains more [[potassium]] and has less nutritional content per gram than meat so more must be eaten to meet the lizard's metabolic needs.  Unlike those of mammals, reptile kidneys cannot concentrate urine to save on water intake. Instead, reptiles excrete toxic nitrogenous wastes as solid uric acid through their [[cloaca]]. In the case of the Cuban iguana, which consumes large amounts of vegetation, these excess salt ions are excreted through the [[salt gland]] in the same manner as in birds.<ref name=Hazard>{{cite book|last=Hazard|first=Lisa C.|title=Sodium and PotassiumSecretion by Iguana Salt Glands|work=Iguanas: Biology and Conservation|publisher=University of California Press|pages=84<U+2013>85, 88|year=2004|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=978-0-520-23854-1}}</ref>

==Mating and behavior==
Cuban iguanas reach sexual maturity at an age of two to three years.<ref name =iucn/> Males are gregarious when immature, but become more aggressive as they age, vigorously defending territories in competition for females.<ref name=isg2/> Females are more tolerant of each other, except after laying their eggs.<ref name=schettino/><ref name=isg2/>

Mating occurs in May and June, and females lay single clutches of three to 30 eggs in June or July.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=schettino/><ref name=isg2/> According to field research, females deposit their eggs at the same nesting sites each year.<ref name=isg2/> The nests are built near each other as suitable nesting sites are becoming rare.<ref name=schettino/><ref name=isg2/> On Cuba's [[Isla de Juventud]], Cuban iguanas nest in pockets of earth exposed to the sun by [[Cuban crocodiles]], after the crocodiles' eggs have hatched.<ref name=iucn/><ref name =schettino/><ref name=isg2/>  These nests are separate from where adult iguanas live.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=schettino/><ref name=isg2/> In areas without crocodiles, the iguanas excavate nests in sandy beaches.<ref name=schettino/> At the San Diego Zoo, a female built a nest at the end of a long chamber she excavated in the sand.<ref name=schettino/> She stood near it for weeks, defending it by shaking her head and hissing at anyone who approached; this behavior demonstrated that Cuban iguanas guard their nest sites.<ref name=schettino>{{cite book|last=Schettino|first=Lourdes Rodriguez|title=The Iguanid Lizards of Cuba |publisher=[[University Press of Florida]]|location=[[Gainesville, Florida]]|page=428 |year=1999|isbn=978-0-8130-1647-4}}</ref> The hatchlings spend several days to two weeks in the nest chamber from the time they hatch to the time they emerge from the nests; dispersing individually after emergence.<ref name=christian/>

Although Cuban iguanas typically remain still for long periods of time and have a slow lumbering gait due to their body mass, they are capable of quick bursts of speed for short distances. Younger animals are more arboreal and will seek refuge in trees, which they can climb with great agility. The animal is a capable swimmer and will take to nearby water if threatened. When cornered they can bite and lash their tails in defense.<ref name=Rivero>{{cite book|last=Rivero|first=Juan A.|title=Los Anfibios Y Reptiles De Puerto Rico: The Amphibians and Reptiles of Puerto Rico|publisher=[[University of Puerto Rico]]|date=1976|language=English and Spanish|page=444|location=San Juan, Puerto Rico|isbn=978-0-8477-2317-1}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Cu-map.jpg|thumb|alt=This is a white on blue map of Cuba as would be seen in a World Atlas.|right|450px|Map of Cuba]]

The Cuban iguana is naturally distributed in rocky coastal areas on Cuba and throughout as many as 4,000 islets surrounding the Cuban mainland, including [[Isla de la Juventud]] off the southern coast, which has one of the most robust populations.<ref name=hollingsworth/><ref name=schettino/> Relatively safe populations are found on some islets along the north and south coasts and in isolated protected areas on the mainland.<ref name=iucn/> These include Guanahacabibes Biosphere Reserve in the west, [[Desembarco del Granma National Park]], Hatibonico Wildlife Refuge, Punta Negra-Quemados Ecological Reserve, and Delta del Cauto Wildlife Refuge, all in eastern Cuba. Because of this wide distribution, accurate information about the number of distinct subpopulations of Cuban iguanas cannot be determined.<ref name=hollingsworth/> The population on the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|US Naval Base]] at [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]] has been estimated at 2,000 to 3,000 individuals, and the animals are treated well and protected by US forces stationed at the base.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=gitmo>{{cite journal|last=Frantom|first=Todd|title=Cuban Sanctuary|journal=[[All Hands]]|volume=87|issue=1058|page=14|publisher=Navy News Service|date=June 2005|url= http://www.navy.mil/media/allhands/acrobat/ah200506.pdf|accessdate=December 4, 2009}}</ref><ref name=Nelson/> An unusual incident occurred when a detainee in the prison assaulted a guard with a bloody tail torn from a Cuban iguana in May 2005.<ref>{{cite news|last=Linsley|first=Brennan|title=Gitmo guards often attacked by detainees|work=[[USA Today]]|date=July 31, 2006|url= http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-07-31-gitmo-guards_x.htm|accessdate= December 13, 2011}}</ref><ref name=Murdock>{{cite news|last=  Murdock|first=Deroy|title=Gitmo detainees really are nasty guys|work=[[Deseret News]]|location=[[Salt Lake City]]|date=August 5, 2006|url= http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,640199878,00.html|accessdate=September 6, 2008}}</ref>

The subspecies, ''Cyclura nubila caymanensis'', is endemic to the "Sister Islands" of [[Little Cayman]] and [[Cayman Brac]]. The population on Cayman Brac is less than 50 of these animals and Little Cayman supports 1,500. A feral population of ''C. n. caymanensis'' has been established on [[Grand Cayman]].<ref name=burton1/>

In a round-about way, the Cuban iguana's status under the US [[Endangered Species Act]] made its way into US jurisprudence. In the fall of 2003, [[Guantanamo Bay attorneys|attorney]] Tom Wilner needed to persuade the justices of the US Supreme Court to take the case of a dozen [[Kuwait]]i detainees being held in isolation in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, without charges, without a hearing and without access to a lawyer.<ref name=Honigsberg>{{cite book|last=Honigsberg|first=Peter Jan|title=Our Nation Unhinged: The Human Consequences of the War on Terror|publisher=University of California Press|date=2009|pages=85<U+2013>89|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=978-0-520-25472-5}}</ref> According to Peter Honigsberg, a professor of law at the University of San Francisco, Wilner unsuccessfully made two arguments before the Court to hear his case; in his third argument he changed tactics by mentioning US law and the Cuban iguana.<ref name=Honigsberg/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Honigsberg| first = Peter|title=Inside Guantanamo|page=20|publisher=[[University of San Francisco]]|location=[[San Francisco]], [[California|CA]]|date=2009| url=http://www.law.usfca.edu/centers/documents/insideguantanamo.pdf|accessdate= December 18, 2009}}</ref>  Wilner argued, "Anyone, including a federal official, who violates the [[Endangered Species Act]] by harming an iguana at Guantanamo, can be fined and prosecuted.

===Decline===

As opposed to other West Indian islands where iguanids are found, consumption of iguana meat is not widespread in Cuba.<ref name=naturalist/> Certain fishing communities do practice it for subsistence, but for the most part the animal is not eaten by Cubans.<ref name=naturalist/> According to naturalist [[Thomas Barbour]], this is based on unfounded superstitious beliefs which suggest that the iguanas emit a dark fluid reminiscent of the black vomit of [[yellow fever]] victims when they are killed.<ref name=naturalist>{{cite journal|last=Barbour| first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Barbour|title=A Naturalist in Cuba|journal =The American Naturalist|volume=80|issue=790|pages=243<U+2013>244|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|date=1946|doi=10.1086/281428}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last= Barbour|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Barbour|coauthors=Charles T.

All but one of the major iguana concentrations are either partially or fully protected by the Cuban government.<ref name=schettino/> Although no captive-breeding program exists within Cuba, the ''Centro Nacional de Areas Protegidas'' (the National Center for Protected Areas) has suggested it will explore this route in the future.<ref name=schettino/> In 1985 the Cuban government issued a commemorative peso depicting a Cuban iguana on the head side of the coin in an attempt to raise awareness for this animal.<ref name=schettino/>

In 1993 the [[San Diego Zoo]] experimentally tested the utility of a "head-starting" program for newly hatched Cuban iguanas with funding from the National Science Foundation's Conservation and Restoration Biology Program.<ref name=Nelson/><ref name=alberts>{{cite book|last=Alberts|first=Allison|last2=Lemm|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Grant|first3=Tandora|last4=Jackintell|first4=Lori| title=Testing the Utility of Headstarting as a Conservation Strategy for West Indian Iguanas|work=Iguanas: Biology and Conservation|publisher=University of California Press|page=210|year=2004|isbn=978-0-520-23854-1}}</ref> "Head-starting" is a process by which the Cuban iguana's eggs are hatched in an incubator and the animals are protected and fed for the first 20 months of their lives.<ref name=Nelson/><ref name=alberts/> The purpose is to get the animals to a size where they are more capable of fleeing from or fighting off predators.<ref name=Nelson/><ref name=alberts/> This technique was originally used to protect hatchling [[sea turtles]], [[Galapagos land iguana]]s, and ''[[Ctenosaura bakeri]]'' on the island of [[Utila]], but Alberts used it for the first time on a ''Cyclura'' species with the Cuban iguana.<ref name=alberts/> The purpose was not only to help the Cuban iguana population, but to test the overall effectiveness of headstarting as a conservation strategy for more critically endangered species of ''Cyclura''.<ref name=alberts/>

The strategy proved successful, according to Alberts, when the released head-started iguanas reacted to predators, foraged for food, and behaved like their wild-born counterparts.<ref name=alberts/><ref name=isg1st>{{Cite journal|title= Taxon Reports|journal=Iguana Specialist Group Newsletter|volume=1|issue=1|page=3|year=1998|url=http://www.iucn-isg.org/newsletters/pdf/WIISG_News_1(1).pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=August 23, 2007}}</ref> This strategy has been implemented with great success with other critically endangered species of ''Cyclura'' and ''[[Ctenosaura]]'' throughout the West Indies and [[Central America]], notably the [[Jamaican iguana]], [[Blue iguana|Grand Cayman blue iguana]], [[Cyclura ricordi|Ricord's iguana]], [[Cyclura cychlura inornata|Allen Cays iguana]], [[Cyclura rileyi rileyi|Acklins Ground Iguana]], and [[Cyclura pinguis|Anegada iguana]].<ref name=Nelson/><ref name=alberts/>

*<cite id="fn_a">[[#fn a back|Note a:]]</cite>Burton, F. (2004):  The 1977 study by Schwartz and Carey included scalation counts for different species of ''Cyclura'', but did not distinguish ''Cyclura nubila'' from ''Cyclura cychlura'' found in the Bahamas. Fred Burton noted a conspicuously enlarged [[Canthal scales|canthal scale]] in ''Cyclura cychlura'' while performing his survey of ''Cyclura''. Burton's conclusion was that in 2 of 38 specemins of [[Blue iguana|Cyclura lewisi]], the fourth [[auricular]] row was so reduced as to appear like ''[[Cyclura nubila caymanensis]]'', and in six of 38 ''C. n. caymanensis'', a complete row of five auriculars was present. The character was intermediate for ''Cyclura nubila'', where 10 of 32 specimens showed a complete auricular row.
