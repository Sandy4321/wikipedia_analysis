The game follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] as he attempts to restore the world to normal after his nemesis, [[Doctor Eggman]], splits the world into pieces, as well as his struggles with his new beast form, Sonic the [[Werewolf|Werehog]]. Gameplay features two distinct styles, with each being played either during daytime or night-time. Daytime stages incorporate Sonic's traditional [[platform game|platforming]] and trademark speed, with a combination of behind-the-back third-person viewpoints and 2D side-scroller platforming; gameplay seamlessly transitions between these two views.<ref name="segauk">{{cite web|url=http://www.sega.co.uk/games/?g=230|title=Sega :: Games :: Sonic Unleashed|author=Sega UK|accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref> Night-time levels see Sonic transform into the Werehog; gameplay slows down to accommodate greater platform play, and involves combat against waves of enemies using the Werehog's brute strength.

The game's existence was first brought to light when Sega trademarked the ''Unleashed'' name, and shortly after, images and a gameplay video were leaked to the public in March, 2008. Public anticipation for the game was high, owing to the video's demonstration of some two-dimensional gameplay, seen as a possible return to Sonic's platforming roots. However, critical reception for the game was mixed, with reviewers praising certain elements, such as the sense of speed in daylight stages and the graphics and audio that make up the environments, and criticising others, such as the new Werehog game mechanic, as well as several gameplay and design concepts. Reviewers largely felt that, despite initial optimism when first revealed, ''Unleashed'' was ultimately not the title that would be able to reinvigorate the series, as was needed to bring the Sonic series as a whole back to prominence.<ref name="review_1up" /><ref name="review_telegraph">{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/technologyreviews/videogamereviewsandpreviews/3477009/Sonic-Unleashed-video-game-review.html|title=Sonic Unleashed video game review - Telegraph|publisher=The Telegraph|date=2008-11-18|accessdate=2008-11-18|first=Tom|last=Hoggins}}</ref><ref name="review_eurog">{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=320131 | title = Sonic Unleashed Review - Page 1 | first = Dan | last = Whitehead | publisher = Eurogamer | accessdate = 2008-11-28 | date = 2008-11-27}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Sonic Unleashed 3D Mode.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Third-person gameplay in daytime levels.]]
Gameplay in ''Sonic Unleashed'' focuses on two modes of platforming play: fast-paced levels that take place during daytime, showcasing Sonic's trademark speed as seen in previous games in the series, and slower, night-time levels, during which Sonic's Werehog form emerges, and gameplay switches to an action-based, brawler style of play, in which Sonic battles Gaia enemies (those created by the main enemy in the game, Dark Gaia).<ref name="review_tvg">{{cite web | url = http://www.totalvideogames.com/Sonic-Unleashed/review-13490.html | title = Sonic Unleashed Review | publisher = TotalVideoGames.com | first = Chris | last = Leyton | accessdate = 2008-12-02 | date = 2008-12-01}}</ref><ref name="review_destructoid">{{cite web | url = http://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-review-sonic-unleashed-112928.phtml | title = Destructoid review: Sonic Unleashed | first = Jim | last = Sterling | accessdate = 2008-12-02 | date = 2008-11-30}}</ref> Each level takes place on a particular continent, each of which have been modelled on real-world locations.<ref name="gamestm">{{cite journal|journal=games<U+2122>|title=Sonic Unleashed|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|issue=|pages=pp. 28-31|date=July 2008|url=http://www.campsonic.com/gamestm-sonic-unleashed-scans}}</ref> In sections of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game, the player may choose to advance the time of day in order to play as either Sonic or the Werehog; in the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions, time is advanced automatically.<ref name="review_eurog_wii">{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=321416 | title = Sonic Unleashed Review - Wii | publisher = Eurogamer | first = Dan | last = Whitehead | date = 2008-11-29 | accessdate = 2008-12-01}}</ref>

Daytime levels focus on Sonic's speed, and to this extent, sees the player control Sonic through fast-moving stages containing both 2D and 3D styles of gameplay.<ref name="review_ign" /> 2D sections are reminiscent of the [[Sega Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]]-era Sonic games, where the player controls Sonic in a [[side-scrolling]] fashion,<ref name="review_ign_aus" /> while 3D sections sees the camera placed behind Sonic, so the player may move in all directions. In addition to moves available in past games, such as wall jumping and the homing attack,<ref name="review_cheatcc" /> new moves are also introduced. For instance, a new side-step feature is available known as "Quick Step", allowing Sonic to dodge left-and-right, and a "Speed Drift" feature allows Sonic to turn around corners at high speed, without slowing down.<ref name="review_cheatcc">{{cite web | url = http://cheatcc.com/xbox360/rev/sonicunleashedreview.html | title = Sonic Unleashed Review for Xbox 360 | first = Adam | last = Brown | accessdate = 2008-12-03 | publisher = Cheat Code Central}}</ref> The game also affords a new gameplay mechanic for speed in the form of "Sonic Boost", which temporarily increases Sonic's speed, as well as allowing him to smash through objects, destroy enemies instantly, or even access different level paths.<ref name="review_worthplaying" /> In the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, an on-screen "Ring Energy" meter is used to display how much boost is available.<ref name="review_worthplaying">{{cite web | url = http://www.worthplaying.com/article.php?sid=57865 | title = WorthPlaying - All about games! | publisher = WorthPlaying.com | accessdate = 2008-12-02 | date = 2008-11-27}}</ref> The amount of boost remaining may be increased by collecting more rings, and is decreased when the player uses it.<ref name="review_worthplaying" /> In contrast, the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions of the game, available boost is represented by bars, which may be increased by performing "Action Chains", destroying multiple enemies in quick succession through the use of homing attacks or by collecting rings.

[[Image:Sonic Unleashed 2D.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Side-scrolling gameplay in daytime levels.]]
The night-time levels feature slower, action-oriented gameplay, in which Sonic transforms into the Werehog, a beast form that has great strength and stretchable arms.<ref name="review_vg">{{cite web | first = Tom | last = Orry | url = http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/sonic_unleashed/review.html | title = Sonic Unleashed Review for Xbox 360 | publisher = VideoGamer.com | date = 2008-11-28 | accessdate = 2008-11-30}}</ref> Gameplay here sees the player use a variety of melee and combo attacks to defeat a large number of enemies, collect items and move items around to advance through the level, and use his stretchable arms to cling to distant objects;<ref name="review_vg" /> simple puzzle elements are also featured.<ref name="review_gamepro" /> Collecting rings in these segments replenishes the Werehog's health,<ref name="review_ign_aus" /> while a special move, "Unleashed", allows the Werehog to channel his anger into increasing the power of his attacks for a short time.<ref name="review_teamxbox" /> Night-time levels have been adjusted in the Wii version to allow greater use of the Wii Remote, where players may control the arms of the Werehog by using the Wii Remote and Nunchuck in order to grab onto objects and move forward in the levels.<ref name="review_eurog_wii" /> The Wii version of the game also expands upon the ratio of night-time levels to daytime, with more than three times as many night-time levels (twenty-five in all).<ref name="review_onm">{{cite web | url = http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/article.php?id=6554 | title = Review: Sonic Unleashed - Official Nintendo Magazine | first = Chris | last = Scullion | publisher = Official Nintendo Magazine | accessdate = 2008-11-30 | date = 2008-11-28}}</ref>

In addition to these two gameplay types, ''Unleashed'' also features "hub-worlds", in which the player may find out about information, as well as advance the story of the game.<ref name="review_vg" /> Hub-worlds operate differently depending on the version of the game being played; the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions feature fully-interactive, explorable 3D hub-worlds, where townspeople may be interacted with and sidequests may be undertaken, in order to gain experience or unlock items, such as artwork, videos and music tracks.<ref name="review_vg" /><ref name="review_ign_aus" /> In contrast, the Wii and PlayStation 2 version features a menu-based map system, where players simply click the appropriate area to talk to the townspeople and find information.<ref name="review_eurog_wii" /> Within both day and night-time levels are medals that Sonic may collect, two types of which exist: Sun and Moon.<ref name="review_worthplaying" /> Collecting these medals allows the player to level up Sonic's Sun and Moon stats, and these must be increased to reach new stages in the game, with a certain number of Moon medals for Sonic levels, and a certain number of Sun medals for Werehog levels.<ref name="review_worthplaying" /> Because only the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions feature playable hub-worlds, this is also the only version in which Sun and Moon medals may be found by exploring the towns, talking to the citizens, and completing side-quests.<ref name="review_worthplaying" />

==Development==
[[Image:Sonic Unleashed Wii.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Screenshot of the Wii version, featuring Sonic the Werehog.]] 
Sonic Team began development of the game in 2006, after having begun work on the core technology, the Hedgehog Engine, in 2005.<ref name="blog_ign_10-16">{{cite web | url = http://blogs.ign.com/SEGA_SonicUnleashed/2008/10/16/ | title = SEGA_SonicUnleashed's Blog - Sonic Unleashed - A New Direction | accessdate = 2008-12-06 | date = 2008-10-16 | first = Patrick | last = Riley | publisher = IGN}}</ref> The title was first brought to public attention when the ''Sonic Unleashed'' name was trademarked by [[Sega]] on March 12, 2008.<ref name="gamepro_leak">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/171568/sonic-unleashed-screens-and-video-leaked-online/|title=Sonic Unleashed screens and video leaked online? |accessdate=2008-11-16|last=Snow|first=Blake|date=2008-03-12|publisher=[[GamePro]]}}</ref> Screenshots of cut scenes, artwork, and a video were leaked ten days later,<ref name="gamepro_leak" /> with the title then officially confirmed by Sega on April 3, 2008<ref name="sega_confirm">{{cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/82940-Sega-Confirms-Sonic-Unleashed | title = The Escapist : News : Sega Confirms Sonic Unleashed | date = 2008-04-03 | accessdate = 2008-12-03 | first = Andy | last = Chalk | publisher = The Escapist}}</ref> with a small selection of screenshots and an updated video.

However, the development team began to introduce enough new innovations to separate it from the Sonic Adventure titles,<ref name="npaugust08">{{cite journal|journal=Nintendo Power|pages=pp. 67-69|title=Sonic Unleashed|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|date=August 2008}}</ref> and so a new title, Sonic Unleashed, was decided upon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sega.com/sonic/2008/06/10/sonic-world-adventure/|title=Sonic City Blognik: <U+201C>Sonic World Adventure<U+201D>|author=Sonic City Blognik|accessdate=2008-06-13|date=2008-06-10}}</ref> It was then later revealed that the game's name in Japan would in fact remain ''Sonic World Adventure'' for its release there.<ref name="gamestm" />

Sonic Team decided early on in the development process to reduce the number of characters present in the game, as well as to make Sonic the only playable character; this decision was taken to get more quality out of fewer characters.<ref name="blog_ign_11-03">{{cite web | url = http://blogs.ign.com/SEGA_SonicUnleashed/2008/11/03/105149/ | title = SEGA_SonicUnleashed's Blog - Sonic Unleashed - Night of the Werehog | first = Yoshihisa | last = Hashimoto | publisher = IGN | accessdate = 2008-12-06 | date = 2008-11-03}}</ref> While it felt that these ideas combined with traditional Sonic gameplay was a good beginning, it also had to consider how to introduce newer gamers unfamiliar with the Sonic franchise to the series, and so the concept of the Werehog was born.<ref name="blog_ign_11-03" /> Director Yoshihisa Hashimoto felt from the outset that there would be both praise and criticism, but hoped that long-term Sonic fans would understand and empathise with the ideas and direction the team had taken.<ref name="blog_ign_11-03" />

In terms of technology, Hashimoto remarked that the visual style was born out of desire to see a [[global illumination]] solution used for the game's lighting <U+2014> that is, light reflecting from one object in the scene onto others.<ref name="blog_ign_11-03">{{cite web | url = http://blogs.ign.com/SEGA_SonicUnleashed/2008/11/03/105149/ | title = SEGA_SonicUnleashed's Blog - Sonic Unleashed - Night of the Werehog | first = Yoshihisa | last = Hashimoto | publisher = IGN | accessdate = 2008-12-06 | date = 2008-11-03}}</ref> To this extent, development on the renderer for this process began, and the final solution allowed the developers to use [[distributed rendering]] over hundreds of computers to calculate lighting for each ten- to twenty-kilometer action stage in around two or three days.<ref name="blog_ign_11-03" /> Characters, enemies and objects are then lit at run-time with Sonic Team's "Light Field" technology to blend them in with the surrounding pre-calculated lighting.<ref name="blog_ign_11-03" /> Because the game was being developed for two levels of hardware capability depending on the target platform, two development "silos" were set up to work on two separate builds of the game: one for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version utilizing the Hedgehog Engine, and one for the Wii and PlayStation 2 version, which instead utilizes a modified version of an existing, internal Sega engine.<ref name="npaugust08" /><ref name="gsinterview">{{cite interview|last=Rileyk|first=Patrick|interviewer=Ricardo Torres|program=Gamespot: Sonic Unleashed Interview 1 |date=2008-05-16|accessdate=2008-05-16|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/video/945571/6191201/sonic-unleashed-interview-1}}</ref>

Initially, it was stated that Unleashed was to be intended solely as a single-player experience, and would not offer any multiplayer or online modes.<ref name="npaugust08" /> This was cast into doubt when references to online modes were alluded to around E3 2008,<ref name="E3">{{cite interview|interviwer=Ryan MacDonald|first=Ken|last=Ballow|url=http://www.gamespot.com/video/945571/6194260/sonic-unleashed-e3-2008-stage-show-demo|title=Sonic Unleashed E3 2008 Stage Show Demo|date=2008-07-16|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> but later interviews re-iterated that ''Unleashed'' would have no online modes at all.<ref name="qandagamespot" /> However, downloadable content, including additional levels, remains a possibility after the game's release.<ref name="qandagamespot" /> A demo version was released on the Xbox Live Marketplace on December 08, 2008<ref name="xbox demo" /> and on the US and EU PlayStation Stores on December 18 and 24, 2008, respectively.

Initial anticipation when the first media for ''Unleashed'' was revealed was high, as the demonstration videos hinted at a possible return of Sonic to his traditional platforming roots, especially after the decrease in the series' popularity and critical success after Sonic's transition to three-dimensional gameplay,<ref name="review_telegraph">{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/technologyreviews/videogamereviewsandpreviews/3477009/Sonic-Unleashed-video-game-review.html|title=Sonic Unleashed video game review - Telegraph|publisher=The Telegraph|date=2008-11-18|accessdate=2008-11-18|first=Tom|last=Hoggins}}</ref> and a number of poorly received titles in the franchise that preceded it, such as [[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]] and the 2006 game, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (2006 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]. However, critical reception to ''Unleashed'' has been mixed, with Metacritic aggregate scores of 56, 60, 67 and 66 out of 100 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PlayStation 2 versions respectively.<ref name="agg_metaps3">{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ps3/sonicunleashed?q=sonic%20unleashed | title = Sonic Unleashed (ps3: 2008): Reviews | publisher = Metacritic | accessdate = 2008-12-15}}</ref><ref name="agg_meta360">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/sonicunleashed?q=sonic%20unleashed | title = Sonic Unleashed (xbox360: 2008): Reviews | publisher = Metacritic | accessdate = 2008-11-30}}</ref><ref name="agg_metawii">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/wii/sonicunleashed?q=sonic%20unleashed | title = Sonic Unleashed (wii: 2008): Reviews | publisher = Metacritic | accessdate = 2008-11-30}}</ref><ref name="agg_metaps2">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ps2/sonicunleashed?q=sonic%20unleashed | title = Sonic Unleashed (ps2: 2008): Reviews | publisher = Metacritic | accessdate = 2008-11-30}}</ref> The added element of motion controls for the Werehog sections, as well as text-based hub worlds and better Werehog level design and camera system, were reasons cited for the higher review scores for the Wii version of the game,<ref name="review_gi">{{cite web | url = http://gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200901/R08.1118.1718.47190.htm | title = Game Informer Online | first = Ben | last = Reeves | accessdate = 2008-11-30 | publisher = Game Informer}}</ref><ref name="review_eurog_wii">{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=321416 | title = Sonic Unleashed Review - Wii | publisher = Eurogamer | first = Dan | last = Whitehead | date = 2008-11-29 | accessdate = 2008-12-01}}</ref> though a few review websites, such as 1UP, gave the Wii version a lower score than its 360 and PS3 counterparts.<ref name="review_1up" /><ref name="review_1up_wii" />

Positive elements of ''Unleashed'' remarked upon by reviews include the environments, such as the "postcard-perfect architecture",<ref name="review_1up" /> and the graphics, with stages looking "absolutely gorgeous"<ref name="review_1up" /> and being "very pretty and lovingly animated",<ref name="review_ign_aus">{{cite web | url = http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/933/933949p1.html | title = IGN AU: Sonic Unleashed Review | first = Patrick | last = Kohan | accessdate = 2008-11-30 | date = 2008-11-26 | publisher = IGN AU}}</ref> with one reviewer comparing them to a playable Pixar film.<ref name="review_teamxbox" /> Praise was given to the technical competence of Sega's new Hedgehog Engine as a whole on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, with "bright cartoonish graphics that fly by without a stutter";<ref name="review_gi">{{cite web | url = http://gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200901/R08.1118.1718.47190.htm | title = Game Informer Online | first = Ben | last = Reeves | accessdate = 2008-11-30 | publisher = Game Informer}}</ref> however, some complaints were raised about [[frame rate]] reduction when large numbers of enemies appeared during the Werehog sections.<ref name="review_gamedaily" /> Although the Wii and PlayStation 2 versions do not use the Hedgehog Engine, graphics for these platforms were still praised for their high quality,<ref name="review_ign">{{cite web|url=http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/931/931596p1.html|title=IGN: Sonic Unleashed Review|publisher=IGN|first=Matt|last=Casamassina|accessdate=2008-11-20|date=2008-11-18}}</ref> with the title being nominated for Best Graphics Technology for the Wii by IGN in its 2008 video game awards.<ref name="igngraphics">{{cite web |title=IGN Wii: Best Graphics Technology 2008 |url=http://bestof.ign.com/2008/wii/11.html |publisher=[[IGN]].com |accessdate=2008-12-19 |date=2008-12-18}}</ref> The soundtrack to the game was also praised as being an improvement on more recent installments in the series;<ref name="review_ign" /> use of an orchestral score, rather than rock as in more recent games, was appreciated.<ref name="review_ign_aus" />

An almost universally strong negative reaction was given by critics to the Werehog concept and corresponding night-time sections, which contributed greatly to the lower than expected review scores. Complaints stemmed from the game's change of speed, from high-speed daytime sections to the slower, night-time sections; the "pace-breaking combat levels"<ref name="review_teamxbox">{{cite web | url = http://reviews.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/1635/Sonic-Unleashed/p1/ | title = Sonic Unleashed Review (Xbox 360) | first = Matt | last = Cabral | publisher = TeamXbox | accessdate = 2008-11-30 | date = 2008-11-25}}</ref> were described as "plodding",<ref name="review_gi" /> as well as "lethargic" and "combat-heavy".<ref name="review_1up" /> Further to the change of pace, the new style of gameplay that accompanies the night-time levels was widely criticised, involving "frustrating" platform elements<ref name="review_gi" /> and combat described as not "terribly interesting"<ref name="review_cc">{{cite web | url = http://cheatcc.com/xbox360/rev/sonicunleashedreview.html | title = Sonic Unleashed Review for Xbox 360 | publisher = Cheatcc.com | accessdate = 2008-11-30 | first = Adam | last = Brown}}</ref> and "boring",<ref name="review_gi" /> with "awkward" action sequences overall.<ref name="review_gamepro" /> Some reviewers felt that the Werehog as a concept did not mix well with the daylight areas and traditional Sonic gameplay; GamePro's review described them as "dreadfully out-of-place",<ref name="review_gamepro">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/208005/sonic-unleashed-360/ | title = Review : Sonic Unleashed - 360 [Xbox 360] | publisher = GamePro | first = Tracy | last = Erickson | date = 2008-11-24 | accessdate = 2008-11-30}}</ref> while IGN stated that they have "nothing to do with Sonic whatsoever", feeling that the Werehog was "being slapped on" to the Sonic experience.<ref name="review_ign_360">{{cite web | url = http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/934/934713p1.html | title = IGN: Sonic Unleashed Review | first = Hilary | last = Goldstein | accessdate = 2008-12-03 | date = 2008-12-02}}</ref>

In stark contrast to the Werehog sections, many reviewers found the daytime levels to be enjoyable, especially the "exhilarating"<ref name="review_1up" /> sense of speed they provide; with "the most satisfying gameplay of any Sonic title in years",<ref name="review_gamepro" /> the game "perfectly [captures] the feel of classic Sonic".<ref name="review_gamepro" /> Many also enjoyed the mixture of, and transition between, 2D and 3D sections.<ref name="review_teamxbox" /> Indeed, many reviewers remarked that they would have appreciated the game more had it comprised solely of, and expanded upon, the daytime levels.<ref name="review_1up">{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3171439 | title = Sonic Unleashed Review | accessdate = 2008-11-20 | date=2008-11-20 | last = Bettenhausen | first = Shane | publisher = 1UP}}</ref><ref name="review_gamedaily">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamedaily.com/games/sonic-unleashed/xbox-360/game-reviews/review/7043/2209/ | title = Sonic Unleashed on Xbox 360 Review | publisher = GameDaily | accessdate = 2008-11-30 | date = 2008-11-25 | first = Chris | last = Buffa}}</ref><ref name="review_gi" /> GameSpot's review for the Xbox 360 version however argued that the controls were "unresponsive in the daytime levels, and that most of them were "horribly designed",<ref name="review_gamespot">{{cite web | url = http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/sonicunleashed/review.html | title = Sonic Unleashed for Xbox 360 Review | date = 2008-12-06 | accessdate = 2008-12-06 | first = Tom | last = McShea | publisher = GameSpot}}</ref> instead describing the Wii version as a "vastly superior experience", with its daytime levels praised for better control and design.<ref name="review_gamespot_wii">{{cite web | url = http://uk.gamespot.com/wii/action/sonicunleashed/review.html | title = Sonic Unleashed for Wii Review | date = 2008-12-06 | accessdate = 2008-12-13| first = Tom | last = McShea | publisher = GameSpot}}</ref>

Aside from the criticism of Werehog levels, further aspects of the game were criticised, contributing to the low review scores. The quests that players must undertake in hub-towns were described as "inane"<ref name="review_1up" /> and "tedious",<ref name="review_gi" /> where "figuring out what happens next involves aimlessly wandering through towns and speaking to citizens, only to discover that most of them don't know what we're looking for".<ref name="review_gamedaily" /> The story and overall tone of the game, including the new character Chip, were criticised,<ref name="review_gamedaily" /> some remarking that it was too juvenile,<ref name="review_ign_aus" /> or comparable to that of a Saturday morning cartoon.<ref name="review_1up" /> Some reviewers also felt that the voice acting for characters was poor.<ref name="review_gi" /><ref name="review_cc" /><ref name="review_onm" />
