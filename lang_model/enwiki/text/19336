The '''Artillery Ground''' in [[Finsbury]] is one of [[London]]'s most centrally located [[cricket ground]]s, situated just off the [[City Road]] immediately north of the [[City of London]]. It belongs to the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] and is hemmed in by the Company's headquarters and numerous office buildings.

The earliest definite [[cricket]] match at the Artillery Ground took place on [[31 August]] [[1730]] between teams styled [[London]] and [[Surrey]].  London won but no other details are known ('''source''': [[H T Waghorn]] - ''Cricket Scores 1730 <U+2013> 1773'').

In the 18th century sources, particularly those recorded by [[G B Buckley]], the Artillery Ground was said to lie ''between Chiswell Street and Bunhill Fields'', the latter being a cemetery.  It was referred to in contemporary reports as the ''old'' Artillery Ground, but this may be because it was used frequently for other forms of sport or entertainment.  It was generally used for matches involving the original [[London Cricket Club|London Club]] and also became the featured venue of all London cricket until about [[1765]], after which the focus shifted to [[Hambledon Club|Hambledon]] and the London Club disbanded.
