The '''Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia''', also known as the '''DC Police''', '''DCPD''', '''MPD''', '''DC Metro''', '''Metro PD''', and '''MPDC''' is the [[township|municipal]] [[police]] force for [[Washington, D.C.]]  It is one of the ten largest police forces within the [[United States]].<ref name="about the mpdc">[http://mpdc.dc.gov/mpdc/cwp/view,a,1230,Q,537757,mpdcNav_GID,1529,mpdcNav,|,.asp About the MPDC]</ref>

==History==
Upon the establishment of the District of Columbia, the states of [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]] appointed constables to patrol the city. In 1802, the city was given police primacy and appointed a Captain of the Watch and 15 watchmen.  The modern-day Metropolitan Police Department was officially formed on August 6, 1861 in accordance with the personal wishes of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]], who had taken a personal interest in the establishment of regular police for the nation's capital.<ref name="MPD history">[http://mpdc.dc.gov/mpdc/cwp/view,a,1230,q,540333,mpdcNav_GID,1529,mpdcNav,|31458|.asp Brief History of the MPDC]</ref>

==Duties==
The department's duties include the provision of police services to the city and its inhabitants and to supplement the various Uniformed Federal Law Enforcement agencies (primarily [[United States Secret Service|U.S.Secret Service]], [[United States Park Police|U.S. Park Police]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation Police|FBI Police]], and [[United States Capitol Police|U.S. Capitol Police]]) in the city, with whom the department exercises concurrent jurisdiction.  Additionally, due to its location within an independent federal city, the department must exercise the standard functions of a local police force and also handle certain activities normally considered within the domain of a [[county police]] or [[state police]] agency such as a [[sex offender registration|sex offender registry]].

==Leadership==
The current Chief of Police is [[Cathy L. Lanier]], who began her career as a MPDC patrol officer, and is the first female chief of the department.  She assumed her post on January 2, 2007, replacing [[Charles H. Ramsey]], who had served under former Washington, D.C. Mayor [[Anthony A. Williams]] and is now [[Philadelphia Police Department|Philadelphia Police]] commissioner.

==Ranks of the MPDC==
There are eleven ranks in the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia:

== Demographics ==
The department maintains 4,050 sworn officers and 600 civilian support staff,<ref name="MPD history"/> making it one of the ten largest police forces within the United States.<ref name="about the mpdc"/>  The department historically has been known for hiring a large number of [[African American]] police officers during times when African American police officers were uncommon in other police departments.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900257-8,00.html POLICE: THE THIN BLUE LINE]</ref> In 1968, African Americans constituted 25% of the department's force and in 1970 constituted 35% of the department's force<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,909452-4,00.html What the Police Can--And Cannot--Do About Crime]</ref> the highest percentages of African American police on a large police department at the time. In 1978, the department became the first police department in a major city in the United States to become majority African American. The department currently has one of the highest percentages of African American officers amongst United States Police Departments, at 66%.  The remainder of the department is 28% White, 5% Hispanic, and 1% Asian. Males account for 76% of the force, while females make up 24%.<ref>[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/lemas00.pdf Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics, 2000: Data for Individual State and Local Agencies with 100 or More Officers]</ref>
