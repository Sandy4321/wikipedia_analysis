'''Society for Science & the Public''' (SSP), formerly known as '''Science Service''', is a [[501(c)3]] [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to the promotion of science, through its science education programs and publications, including the weekly ''[[Science News]]'' magazine.

Headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], the organization works primarily to recruit more pre-college students to pursue science, math, and engineering fields in college. Society for Science & the Public publishes ''[[Science News]]'' and ''Science News for Kids'', and sponsors events including the [[Intel International Science and Engineering Fair]], the [[Intel Science Talent Search]], and the [[Broadcom MASTERS]] (Math, Applied Science, Technology and Engineering for Rising Stars) competition.<ref>[http://www.societyforscience.org/masters The Broadcom MASTERS,] Society for Science and the Public.</ref>

== History ==
SSP was founded in 1921 by journalist [[Edward W. Scripps]] and zoologist [[William Emerson Ritter]].<ref>[http://www.societyforscience.org/history History], Societyforscience.org</ref>  Originally named Science Service, its goal was to inform the public of the latest scientific discoveries and achievements.

Between the World Wars, Science Service sponsored Science Clubs of America, a national organization to popularize science among amateur scientists. High school science clubs were encouraged to join.<ref>{{cite journal|title=News and Views: Science Clubs of America|journal=Nature|date=15 November 1941|volume=148|issue=3759|pages=590|doi=10.1038/148590a0|accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref>
