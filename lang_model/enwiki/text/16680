The '''1st Reconnaissance Squadron''' is the oldest [[squadron]] in the [[United States Air Force]], and the first organization to be established as a U.S. military flying unit. Since [[1922]] the 1st Squadron has been associated with the [[U.S. Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[9th Bomb Group]] and the USAF [[9th Reconnaissance Wing]], where it continues to be an active component.

==Reconnaissance operations 1913-1935==
===1st Aero Squadron 1913-1921===
[[Image:1st aero.jpg|thumb|350px|1st Aero Squadron on the Mexican US border, 1916]]
The squadron was created as the ''1st Provisional Aero Squadron'' of the [[U.S. Army Signal Corps]] on [[March 5]], [[1913]], when eight [[Curtiss JN-4|Curtiss JN2 and JN3 airplanes]] were brought together for the first time as a unit. Under the command of Captain Charles DeForest Chandler (Chief of the [[Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps]]) and led in the field by 1st Lt. [[Thomas D. Milling]], the provisional unit was based in [[Texas City, Texas]] to support the [[U.S. Army]] ground forces gathering as a response to a possible war with the revolutionary forces of General [[Victoriano Huerta]] in [[Mexico]]. The '''1st Aero Squadron''' was officially designated a unit of the U.S. Army on [[December 8]], [[1913]].

The 1st Aero Squadron relocated to [[Rockwell Field|North Island]], [[San Diego]], [[California]], as a flying training unit on [[November 28]], [[1913]]. Its primary training aircraft were the [[Wright Flyer III|Wright C]] (1913<U+2013>1914) and [[Burgess H]] (1913<U+2013>1915), but according to the U.S. Air Force Historical Research Agency, during this period also included at least one example of the Wright B, [[Burgess Company|Burgess F]], [[Burgess Company|Burgess I-Scout]], [[Burgess Company|Burgess J-Scout]], [[Curtiss]] D, Curtiss E, Curtiss H, [[Martin]] TT, and Wright D-Scout.

Detachments of the 1st Aero Squadron returned to [[Fort Crockett]], [[Texas]] in April [[1914]] when the [[Tampico Affair]] threatened war again, and to [[Brownsville]] in March [[1915]] when [[civil war]] broke out between [[Pancho Villa]] and the government of [[Venustiano Carranza]]. The entire squadron transferred by rail on [[July 29]], [[1915]], to [[Fort Sill]], [[Oklahoma]], to learn artillery spotting, and flew to [[Fort Sam Houston]], [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], on [[November 15]], [[1915]].

On [[March 9]], [[1916]], Villista forces raided [[Columbus, New Mexico]], attacking units of the U.S. 13th Cavalry. Commanded by Captain [[Benjamin Foulois]], the 1st Aero Squadron, consisting of 11 officers, 84 enlisted men, and a civilian mechanic, moved to Columbus and made its first [[reconnaissance]] [[sortie]] on [[March 16]]. On [[March 19]], [[1916]], assigned to the [[Punitive Expedition]] commanded by Brig. Gen. [[John J. Pershing]], the squadron entered Mexico, where it operated until February 1917. A forward base was established at [[Colonia Dublan]], the field headquarters of the Expedition near [[Casas Grandes]] in northern [[Chihuahua]]. Detachments continued to serve in Mexico after the squadron returned to Columbus on April 22, 1916, including San Geronimo, San Antonio, Satevo, Namiquipa, and El Valle.

The squadron's 90-[[horsepower]] Curtiss JN2 and JN3 airplanes were unable to climb over the 10,000 to 12,000 foot mountains of the region or overcome the high winds of the passes through them. Dust storms frequently grounded the aircraft and wooden propellers de-laminated in the heat. The squadron carried mail and dispatches, flew limited reconnaissance, and acted as liaison between Pershing and forward units. By [[April 20]], only two airplanes remained in service, four having crashed and three others condemned to provide replacement parts. Four new Curtiss N8 airplanes were delivered on [[April 22]], but they were little better than the JN3's which they closely resembled and were soon transferred to North Island as trainers. Another Curtiss airplane, the R2, was sent to the 1st Aero Squadron with 12 delivered by late May. The R2 was the latest type available but it too proved unsatisfactory for use on the border. Between [[March 15]] and [[August 15]], [[1916]], the 1st Aero Squadron flew 540 missions in Mexico.

The USAF Historical Research Agency notes that in addition to its Curtiss aircraft, the 1st Aero Squadron also field tested "H<U+2013>2, H<U+2013>3, Curtiss Twin JN, R<U+2013>Land, Sturtevant Advanced Trainer, V<U+2013>1, D<U+2013>5, and [[Curtiss JN4|Curtiss JN<U+2013>4]] during period 1916<U+2013>1917." 

When the United States [[Declaration of war by the United States|declared war]] on [[Germany]] on [[April 6]], [[1917]], the 1st Aero Squadron was still based at Columbus, New Mexico. The Army ordered the 1st Aero Squadron to [[Fort Jay]], [[New York]] City to accompany the [[U.S. 1st Infantry Division|1st Division]] to [[France]]. The squadron arrived in August 1917, too late to join the 1st Division, but sailed for France on its own under the command of Major Henry Royce. It arrived at [[Le Havre]] on [[September 3]], [[1917]], the first U.S. squadron in France. 

Untested U.S. squadrons were initially sent to a fairly inactive sector of the Front north of [[Toul]] to acquire combat experience at minimum risk. The 1st Aero Squadron trained at [[Avord]], [[Issoudun]] and Amanty, France, during the winter of 1917-18. Its aircraft were the Curtiss AR-1, [[Spad S.XIII|Spad XIII]] pursuit plane, and [[Salmson]] 2 observation plane.

On [[April 8]], [[1918]], the 1st Aero Squadron was assigned to an aerodrome at [[Ourches]], and was joined shortly after by the 12th and 88th Aero Squadrons to form the [[U.S. I Corps|1st Corps]] Observation Group, the first U.S. air group. The group served as an observation unit for both the [[French]] XXXVIII Corps and the [[U.S. I Corps]], moving its location nine times between April and November.

Early in July, when a German buildup was noted, the 1st Corps Observation group moved westward to reinforce the French on the [[Marne River]]. Flying new Salmsons over the Champagne-Marne region, the 1st Aero Squadron supported [[U.S. Marines]] at [[Chateau-Thierry]] to prevent the German Army from crossing the Marne. The squadron also fought at [[Aisne-Marne]] ([[July 18]] to [[August 6]], [[1918]]), [[St. Mihiel]] ([[September 12]] to 16, [[1918]]), and in the [[Meuse-Argonne offensive]] ([[September 26]] to [[November 11]], [[1918]]). The four Maltese crosses on the 9th Reconnaissance Wing's emblem represent these battles. Although the squadron's primary duties were reconnaissance and artillery surveillance, squadron pilots recorded 13 aerial victories during the war, commemorated by 13 Maltese crosses encircling the 1st's squadron emblem. The 1st Aero squadron lost 16 pilots killed in action and 3 missing-in-action.

After the [[Armistice]] the 1st Corps Observation Group was disbanded. The 1st Aero Squadron accompanied the [[U.S. III Corps]] as part of the [[occupation]] of [[Germany]], stationed at [[Trier]] beginning [[December 6]], [[1918]], and [[Weissenthurm]] from [[January 21]] to July [[1919]], after which it returned to the United States, based first at Park Field, [[Tennessee]] on [[August 4]], [[1919]], and then at [[Mitchel Field]], [[New York]], on [[October 10]], [[1919]], where it remained until [[1940]].

===1st Observation Squadron 1921-1935===
Assigned as a component of the [[U.S. Army Air Service|Air Service's]] [[U.S. First Army|1st Army]] Observation Group from [[October 1]], [[1919]], to [[August 30]], [[1921]], the 1st Aero Squadron was redesignated the '''1st Squadron (Observation)''' on [[March 14]], [[1921]]. It was attached to the ''1st Provisional Air Brigade'' from [[May 1]] to [[October 3]], [[1921]]. This temporary unit, organized by Gen. [[William L. Mitchell]], sank the German [[battleship]] ''[[USS Ostfriesland|Ostfriesland]]'' on [[July 21]] in bombardment tests. The squadron functioned briefly as part of the 2nd Wing before being assigned to the [[U.S. II Corps|Second Corps Area]] on [[September 30]], [[1921]]. The 1st Aero Squadron used the [[Airco DH.4|de Havilland DH-4]] observation airplane as its primary equipment from 1919 to 1928.

The 1st Squadron was assigned as a component squadron of the new 9th Observation Group on August 1, 1922. It was assigned directly to the II Corps on [[March 23]], [[1923]], as the '''1st Observation Squadron''', but remained attached to the 9th Observation Group. This command arrangement continued until [[February 15]], [[1929]], when it the 1st Observation Squadron was permanently assigned to the 9th Group. 

Its aircraft from 1928 to 1935 was primarily the [[Curtiss Falcon|Curtiss O-1B Falcon]] observation plane, but it also field tested and employed other Falcon variants (O-13, O-39, and Y1O-40 Raven) and several Douglas observation types, the Y1O-31, [[Douglas Y1B-7|Y1O-35, and O-35]]. The 1st Observation Squadron's O-35's all participated in [[Air Mail Scandal|delivering the U.S. Mail]] in 1934 without loss.

==Bombardment operations==
===1st Bombardment Squadron 1935-1944===
The Air Service became the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] on [[July 2]], [[1926]]. In early 1935 the Air Corps was re-organized, with all combat groups being centrally controlled for the first time, under a new command organization called General Headquarters, Air Force. The role of observation as the primary function of the air arm had been de-emphasized in the creation of eight new Air Corps groups between 1927 and 1932. With the creation of GHQAF it was further de-emphasized when the 9th and its component squadrons were converted into a bombardment group and made a part of the 2nd Wing, responsible for the air defense of the East Coast of the United States.

The 1st Observation Squadron became the '''1st Bombardment Squadron''' on [[March 1]], [[1935]], and was equipped with [[Keystone B-6]] bombers. It converted to [[Martin B-10]] bombers in 1936 and operated these until 1938, when it again re-equipped, with [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]] [[B-18]] bombers. The designations of the squadron changed in the late 1930's as the role of bombardment became pre-eminent in the Air Corps, becoming the '''1st Bomb Squadron (Medium)''' on [[December 6]], [[1939]], and the '''1st Bomb Squadron (Heavy)''' on [[November 20]], [[1940]]. During the period 1935-1940 the 1st Bomb Squadron trained aircrews, took part in maneuvers, and participated in air shows. 

The 1st deployed with its parent group on [[November 12]], [[1940]], to [[Rio Hato]], an airfield on the [[Gulf of Panama]], to serve as part of the defense force for the [[Panama Canal]]. The 9th Bomb Group was then relocated in a series of moves to [[Caribbean]] bases to conduct [[antisubmarine]] patrols, with the 1st Bomb Squadron sent to Piarco Airport, [[Trinidad]], on [[April 24]], [[1941]]; followed on [[October 30]] by a second move to join the group headquarters squadron at Trinidad's Waller Field. The group's Headquarters Squadron was disbanded on [[July 22]], [[1942]], and the 1st Bomb Squadron switched stations to Edinburg Field, Trinidad, on [[August 23]], where as part of the Antilles Air Task Force it continued antisubmarine patrols and conducted reconnaissance of the [[Vichy French]] fleet at [[Martinique]].
 
The 9th Bomb Group and its squadrons were returned without personnel or equipment to the US in October 1942, where all were reconstituted as part of the [[Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics]] (AAFSAT) at [[McCoy Air Force Base|Orlando Army Air Base]], [[Florida]]. The 1st Bomb Squadron was assigned to AAFSAT's satellite airfield at [[Brooksville, Florida]], where it used [[Boeing]] [[B-17]] aircraft to train cadres for heavy bomb groups in organization and operations, performed bombing pattern tests, experimented with [[Formation (military)|tactical formations]] to attack moving ships, and performed equipment tests.

On [[March 1]], [[1944]], the 1st Bomb Squadron was moved without aircraft or personnel to [[Dalhart, Texas|Dalhart Army Airfield]], [[Texas]]. There, on [[March 28]], it was re-designated the '''1st Bombardment Squadron (Very Heavy)''' and began to organization process for training as a [[B-29 Superfortress]] squadron.

===B-29 operations 1944-1947===
During April the key personnel of the new squadron assembled at Dalhart, forming the command cadre, and were transferred with the group to [[McCook Regional Airport|McCook Army Airfield]], [[Nebraska]]. After a brief period establishing the unit at McCook, the cadre of group and squadron operations staffs went by train to [[Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics|AAFSAT]] in May for the 4-week training course in organizing and operating very heavy bombardment units in the field. While the cadre was at AAFSAT, the influx of new personnel continued at McCook. 

After the return of the squadron staff in June, 1944, the squadron organized new crews and  conducted an intensive program of ground and flying training using B-17 aircraft to practice takeoffs, landings, instrument and night flying, cross-country navigation, high altitutde formation flying, and bombing and gunnery practice. 

The development of the B-29 as an operational weapon had been plagued since an early flight test on [[December 28]], [[1942]], resulted in an engine fire, culminating in a massive emergency modification program in the winter of 1943-44 ordered by [[General]] [[Henry H. Arnold]], Chief of the [[U.S. Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]], and nicknamed the "[[Battle of Kansas]]". In particular the program sought to resolve a spate of problems with serious engine fires and faulty gunnery central fire control systems. All B-29s modified in this program were diverted to the 58th Bomb Wing to meet [[President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s commitment to [[China]] to have B-29's deployed to the [[China Burma India Theater|China-Burma-India Theater]] in the spring of 1944, leaving none available to equip the 12 new groups being formed in the 73rd, 313th, and 314th Wings.

The 9th Group received its first training B-29 on [[July 13]], [[1944]]. After four further months of training the group commander declared the unit ready for movement overseas, and its ground echelon left McCook for [[Seattle, Washington]], Port of Embarkation on [[November 18]], [[1944]], traveling by troopship to the [[Mariana Islands]] on a voyage that required thirty days. The ground echelon of the group debarked at [[Tinian]] on [[December 28]] and was assigned a camp on the west side of the island between the two airfields.

The air echelon of the 1st Bomb Squadron began its overseas movement on [[January 15]], [[1945]], from its staging base at [[Mather Air Force Base|Mather Army Airfield]], [[California]], after accepting the first of its 14 new B-29's at [[Herington Municipal Airport|Herington Field]], [[Kansas]]. The squadron's bombers proceeded individually by way of [[Hickam Air Force Base|Hickam Field]], [[Hawaii]], and [[Kwajalein]] to North Field, Tinian, with the first three arriving on [[January 18]], [[1945]]. The final two of the original 14 airplanes arrived on Tinian on [[February 3]] by which time the squadron had already flown three practice missions to the [[Maug Islands]] in the [[Northern Marianas]].

The 1st Bomb Squadron conducted its first combat mission on [[February 9]], [[1945]], against a Japanese naval airfield located on the island of [[Moen]] at [[Truk]] atoll (now known as the [[Chuuk Islands]]). Flown by day at an altitude of 25,000 feet, it was in actuality a further training mission, encountering no opposition. Its second mission was to [[Iwo Jima]] on [[February 12]], one week prior to D-Day for [[Operation Detachment]]. The capture of Iwo Jima had as its objective an emergency landing field for [[Twentieth Air Force]] bombers attacking [[Japan]] and a base for escorting [[P-51]] and [[P-47]] fighters.

The first mission to the Japanese home islands was the 1st Bomb Squadron's fifth, flown [[February 25]], [[1945]]. Again a day mission flown at high altitude, the target was the port facilities of [[Tokyo]]. On the squadron's seventh mission, [[March 9]] - [[March 10|10]], 1945, Tokyo was attacked with [[Bombing of Tokyo in World War II|incendiaries by night]] and at low altitudes of 6,400 to 7,800 feet. This mission also resulted in the first loss of a 1st Squadron B-29 when the crew of ''L'il [[Iodine]]'' was forced to crash-land at sea when it ran out of fuel returning to Tinian, although the crew was rescued. 

The Tokyo fire raid was the first of five flown between [[March 9]] and [[March 18]], resulting in devastation of four urban areas (Tokyo, [[Nagoya]], [[Osaka]], and [[Kobe]]) and extensive civilian loss of life. The squadron had a bomber shot down and crew lost on [[March 24]], [[1945]], attacking the [[Mitsubishi|Mitsubishi Aircraft]] factory at Nagoya, ironically the same crew that had ditched on [[March 10]].

On [[March 27]] the 1st Squadron began a week of night missions sowing aerial [[Naval mine|anti-shipping mine]]s of Japanese harbor approaches and [[Inland Sea]] ship passages, a mission they would again conduct during the entire second half of May. Attacks in April were a combination of night and medium altitude day missions against the Japanese aircraft industry, and beginning [[April 18]], three weeks of daytime attacks against Japanese airfields on [[Kyushu]] launching ''[[Kamikaze]]'' attacks against [[U.S. Navy|U.S. naval]] forces at [[Okinawa]].

On [[June 1]] the 1st Bomb Squadron began a grim campaign of night fire raids against the remaining urban areas of Japan not previously attacked that continued to its final mission, [[August 14]], [[1945]]. In all the 1st Bomb Squadron flew 71 combat missions, 3 post-hostilities flyover missions, and one mission to drop medical and food supplies to liberated [[prisoners-of-war]].

Of the 71 combat missions, 27 were fire raids, 14 mining, 13 against airfields, 9 against aircraft production, and 9 against other industry or targets other than the home islands. 39 of the missions were flown at night, and 32 by day. Only 6 of the 71 combat missions were flown above 20,000 feet altitude.

The 1st Bomb Squadron had 28 B-29's assigned to it on Tinian. Two were reassigned to other units, one was declared "war-weary" and used for local flights only, two were written off for salvage, one crashed on takeoff [[May 20]], destroying two parked bombers of another group and itself, and six were lost on missions&mdash;an aircraft attrition rate of 34.6% over six months. The squadron had 33 combat crews of 11 airmen each on its rosters during its combat operations. Four crews were missing in action or killed (12%), and three crews completed a full operational tour of 35 missions before the Japanese surrender.

After the end of the war, the squadron received two [[Presidential Unit Citation]]s as part of the 9th Bomb Group, for a mission against [[Kawasaki]] On [[April 15]][[April 16|-16]], [[1945]], and for mine-laying operations [[May 13]][[May 28|-28]], [[1945]].

The 1st Bomb Squadron remained on Tinian until [[March 7]], [[1946]], although most of its crews and aircraft were returned to the United States in the interim to be de-mobilized. On [[March 14]], [[1946]], the group and squadron set up limited operations at [[Clark Air Base|Clark Field]], [[Luzon]], where they remained until [[June 9]], [[1947]]. By that date, although still an active unit, the squadron was unmanned, and was transferred "on paper" to Harmon Field, [[Guam]], where it remained in a paper status until [[October 10]], [[1948]].

==United States Air Force==
===SAC operations 1948-1966===
The [[United States Air Force]] became a separate military service on [[September 18]], [[1947]], during the period of time when the 1st Squadron was without personnel or equipment. On [[October 10]], [[1948]], the 1st Squadron was removed from the 9th Bomb Group (which was inactivated), re-designated the '''1st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, Photographic''', and assigned to the 311th Air Division of the [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) at [[Forbes Air Force Base]], [[Kansas]]. Equipped with [[B-29|RB-29]] and [[B-17|RB-17]] aircraft, the 1st SRS was attached for operations to the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Group on [[October 20]], [[1948]], where it remained until [[May 31]], [[1949]].

On [[June 1]], [[1949]], the 1st SRS was transferred to [[Travis Air Force Base|Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base]], [[California]], and re-assigned to the newly activated 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Group, now the combat component of the [[9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing]]. The 1st SRS was re-designated the '''1st Bombardment Squadron, Heavy''' on [[April 1]], [[1950]], and began training with both B-29 and [[B-36]] bombers. On [[October 2]], [[1950]], the 1st Squadron became the '''1st Bombardment Squadron, Medium''', equipped now with only B-29's.

The 1st Bomb Squadron remained at Fairfield-Suisun AFB, which was re-named Travis Air Force Base in April 1951, and was attached to the 9th Bomb Wing in February 1951 as SAC began a phase-out of groups as operational units. On June 16, 1952, the 9th Group was inactivated and the squadron was assigned directly to Wing control.

On [[May 1]], [[1953]], the 1st Bomb Squadron was transferred with the 9th Bomb Wing to [[Mountain Home Air Force Base]], [[Idaho]]. In 1954 the squadron converted to the [[B-47]] all-jet bomber. It remained at Mountain Home until 1966, with one overseas deployment in [[1955]] to [[RAF Fairford]] from [[May 22]] to [[July 8]]. The 1st Bomb Squadron was awarded an [[Outstanding Unit Award|Air Force Outstanding Unit Award]] for the period [[January 1]], [[1957]] to [[January 31]], [[1958]].

===Strategic Reconnaissance 1966-present===
During January to June 1966 the 1st Bomb Squadron phased out its operations at Mountain Home AFB. On [[June 25]], [[1966]], as the '''1st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron''', it took over the personnel and equipment of the 4201st SRS at [[Beale Air Force Base]], [[California]], and began training with the [[SR-71]] strategic reconnaissance aircraft. 

The squadron began flying operational sorties with the SR-71 in March 1968 with missions to [[North Vietnam]] and [[North Korea]], and conducted high-altitude mach 2 photo reconnaissance missions world-wide until 1990, winning a [[Presidential Unit Citation]] for the period [[March 31]]-[[December 31]], [[1968]], and an [[Air Force Outstanding Unit Award]] With [[Valor device|Combat "V" Device]] for the period [[July 1]], [[1972]]<U+2013>[[June 30]], [[1973]]. The 1st SRS also received ten Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards for the periods [[July 1]]-[[June 30]] of the years [[1967]]<U+2013>[[1968]], [[1970]]<U+2013>[[1971]], [[1971]]<U+2013>[[1972]], [[1975]]-[[1977]], [[1981]]<U+2013>[[1982]], [[1983]]-[[1984]], [[1985]]<U+2013>[[1986]], [[1986]]<U+2013>[[1987]], [[1989]]<U+2013>[[1990]], and [[1991]]<U+2013>[[1993]].

On [[July 1]], [[1990]], with the phase-out of SR-71 operations, the role of the 1st SRS changed when it became the '''1st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron (Training)''', responsible for the selection and training of [[Lockheed U-2|U2]] pilots using the U-2ST trainer.  Since [[July 1]], [[1994]], the squadron has been designated as the '''1st Reconnaissance Squadron'''.
