'''Inchtalla''' or '''Inch Talla''' is an island in the [[Lake of Menteith]], central [[Scotland]]. ("Inch" derives from ''innis'' which is an old Gaelic word meaning "island"). It was also known as the '''Isle of Monteith''', but it is not as big as [[Inchmahome]] nearby. 

The entire island is dominated by [[Talla Castle]], which appears to have been built in the 18th century, but on the site of an earlier building dating from 1428.

Agreement, Countess of Airth and William, [[Earl of Menteith|Earl of Monteith]] 'the haill rooms within the hall door with the second chamber nixt the hall called the schoolhouse and the north chamber nixt adjacent to the hall to be of equell use whenever occasions offers of any of the said countess hir relations or yet the said earl's (being men of quallitie) and the kitching and brewhous to be of common use for serving both parties, and the said Earl to have the littellvoult east the turnpyk on the South syd of the cloass'.''
