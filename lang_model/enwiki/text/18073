'''William Johnston''' (1804-1891), also known as '''Booby Johnston''' was a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] politician from the [[U.S. State]] of [[Ohio]]. He served in the state legislature, was  [[Surveyor General of the Northwest Territory]], was a judge, and was nominated by his party for [[Governor of Ohio]]. He had a highly-profitable legal career.

==Youth==
William Johnston was born April 1, 1804 at [[Shippensburg, Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Nelson & Runk|p=186}} His [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] parents moved the family to Yellow Creek,{{sfn|gnis}} [[Jefferson County, Ohio]] in 1808, where he grew up.{{sfn|Nelson & Runk|p=186}} He attended the schools of [[Ross Township, Jefferson County, Ohio|Ross Township]], and studied law under [[John C. Wright (politician)|John Crafts Wright]] of [[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]].{{sfn|Doyle|p=351}}{{sfn|Hunter|p=207}} He is said to have started the first [[Temperance movement|temperance]] society in the county in 1833.{{sfn|Doyle|p=351}}

==Early professional career==
Johnston settled at [[Carrollton, Ohio|Carrollton]], [[Carroll County, Ohio|Carroll County]], where he was <U+201C>soon retained on one side or the other of all important litigation.<U+201D>{{sfn|Nelson & Runk|p=187}} He was elected prosecuting attorney of Carroll County.{{sfn|Greve|p=771}}{{sfn|Nelson & Runk|p=187}}{{sfn|Doyle|p=351}}{{sfn|Hunter|p=208}} He then served in the [[Ohio House of Representatives]] for a year.{{sfn|Ohio 1917|p=271}} He was active in the legislature, and was effective in his advocacy for the common-school law and the abolition of imprisonment for debt.{{sfn|Nelson & Runk|p=187}}

After describing the difficulties he had had in obtaining an education, he insisted that boys and girls should have a better chance than he did on the banks of <U+201C>Yaller Creek.<U+201D> He said <U+201C>The old Irish schoolmaster holds forth three months of the year in a poor cabin, with greased-paper window panes. The children trudge three miles through winter snow and mud to school. They begin at a-b, ab, and get over as far as b-oo-by, booby, when school gives out, and they take up their spring work on the farm. The next winter, when school takes up again, having forgotten all that they had been taught previously in the speller, they begin again at a-b, ab, but year after year never get any further than b-oo-by, booby.<U+201D>{{sfn|Doyle|p=351}}{{sfn|Hunter|p=208}}

[[Jacob Burnet|Judge Burnet]] said it was the most powerful speech on education ever made in Ohio, but [[Samuel Medary]] of the ''Ohio Statesman'' gave him the name '''Booby Johnson''' disrespectfully. The nickname stuck among Johnston's friends.{{sfn|Doyle|p=352}}{{sfn|Hunter|p=208}}

Johnston also wrote the law which abolished imprisonment for debt in Ohio, when not accompanied by fraud. He was in Steubenville at the time when founder of the city [[Bezaleel Wells]] went bankrupt, and was jailed for his debts. The 1802 [[Ohio Constitution]] allowed a non-fraudulent debtor to be held in prison until he <U+201C>delivered up his estate for the benefit of his creditors.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Ohio Historical Society]] |title=Ohio Constitution 1802, Article VIII, sec. 15 |url=http://www.ohiohistory.org/onlinedoc/ohgovernment/constitution/cnst1802.html }}</ref> Johnston felt the law was unjust, and vowed he would repeal the law should he ever be elected to the legislature.{{sfn|Doyle|p=352}}

==Move to Cincinnati==
Johnston moved to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] in 1839. His first year, 1840, was involved campaigning for [[William Henry Harrison]] for president. He <U+201C>made a great reputation as a stump orator,<U+201D>{{sfn|Greve|p=771}} and was <U+201C>making a reputation as an orator scarcely equaled by that of any of the celebrated speakers of that wonderful campaign.<U+201D>{{sfn|Nelson & Runk|p=187}} His efforts in the campaign led to his appointment as [[Surveyor General of the Northwest Territory]], responsible for the states of Ohio, [[Indiana]] and [[Michigan]].{{sfn|Doyle|p=352}}{{sfn|Hunter|p=209}} He held that position until 1845.{{sfn|White|p=204, 209, 218}}

After ending his federal service, Johnston became judge of the '''Superior Court of Cincinnati''' (1847-1850),{{sfn|Hosea|p=i}} which he held until he ran for [[Governor of Ohio]] as the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] nominee in 1850.{{sfn|Nelson & Runk|p=187}}{{sfn|Greve|p=771}}{{sfn|Peck|p=69}}

In 1850, Johnston came second to [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] [[Reuben Wood]] in a three way race for Governor.{{sfn|Bell|p=304}} He returned to private practice that autumn, and was very successful, <U+201C>particularly before juries.<U+201D>{{sfn|Greve|p=771}} <U+201C>No person could listen to him and ever forget his clearness of logic, his simplicity, his force of style, his vivid flashes of wit, his mirth provoking humor, his moving elocution.<U+201D>{{sfn|Nelson & Runk|p=187}} He was long associated with [[Thomas Corwin]],{{sfn|Hunter|p=210}} including obtaining an acquital with an argument of self-defense in an 1858 trial when ex-Ohio Governor [[William Bebb]] was charged with manslaughter in [[Illinois]].{{sfn|Johnston|p=114}} He also associated with [[Reverdy Johnson]] in a [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] claim against the United States Government, for which they received a fee of $100,000.{{sfn|Hunter|p=210}}

In 1861, Johnston moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] and practiced before the [[United States Court of Claims|Court of Claims]] and the [[United States Supreme Court]].{{sfn|Nelson & Runk|p=187}} President [[Abraham Lincoln]] appointed him to the commission to revise the statutes of the United States, where he served for three years.{{sfn|Nelson & Runk|p=187}} He then retired from public service,{{sfn|Greve|p=771}} and retired from practice at age seventy.{{sfn|Nelson & Runk|p=187}}

==Personal==
Johnston married Elizabeth Blackstone of [[Smithfield Township, Jefferson County, Ohio]], and had two sons, who preceded him in death, and two daughters, who survived him.{{sfn|Hunter|p=210}} He spent the last years of his life at [[Loveland, Ohio]], where he died October 15, 1891.{{sfn|lccn}} The [[Shield's Crossing|William Johnston House]] at Loveland is now listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].
