A '''sports car''' ('''sportscar''') is a small, usually two seat, two door [[automobile]] designed for spirited performance and nimble handling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sports+car |title=Sports car - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-02}}</ref>

The basis for the sports car is traced to the early 20th century [[touring car]]s and [[Roadster (automobile)|roadsters]]. These raced in early [[Rallying|rally]]s, such as the Herkomer Cup, ''Prinz Heinrich Fahrt'', and [[Monte Carlo Rally|Monte Carlo]].<ref name="Georgano">{{cite book| last = Georgano | first = G. N.  | authorlink=G.N. Georgano | title = Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886-1930 | publisher = Grange-Universal | year = 1985 | location = London }}</ref>

Though the term ''sports car'' would not be coined until after World War One, the first sports cars are considered to be the 3 litre 1910 [[Vauxhall Prince Henry|Prince Henry ''(Prinz Heinrich)'' Vauxhall]] 20&nbsp;hp (tax rating) and the 27/80PS [[Austro-Daimler]] designed by [[Ferdinand Porsche]].<ref name="Georgano"/>

These would shortly be joined by the French [[Doriot, Flandrin & Parant|DFP]] (which became sporters after [[Car tuning|tuning]] by H.M. and [[W. O. Bentley]]) and the [[Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost]]. In the U.S., where the type was variously called [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]], [[speedster]], [[Runabout (car)|runabout]], or raceabout, there was [[Apperson]], [[Kissel Motor Car Company|Kissel]], Marion, Midland, National, [[Overland Automobile|Overland]], [[Stoddard-Dayton]], and Thomas among small models, while Chadwick, [[Mercer (car)|Mercer]], [[Stutz Motor Company|Stutz]], and [[Crane-Simplex|Simplex]] were among large models.<ref name="Georgano"/>

In 1921, [[Ballot (automobile)|Ballot]] premiered its 2LS, with a remarkable {{Convert|75|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DOHC two liter, designed by Ernest Henry (formerly of [[Peugeot]]'s [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] program), capable of 150&nbsp;km/h (90&nbsp;mph); at most, one hundred were built in four years. This was followed by the SOHC 2LT and 2LTS. The same year, [[Benz & Cie.|Benz]] built a [[supercharger|supercharged]] 28/95PS four for the [[Coppa Florio]]; [[Max Sailer]] won.<ref name="Georgano"/>

[[Simson (company)|Simson]] in 1924 offered a Paul Henze-designed {{Convert|60|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DOHC 2 liter four, the Simson Supra Type S, in a long-wheelbase 120&nbsp;km/h (60&nbsp;mph) tourer and 115&nbsp;km/h (71&nbsp;mph) twin-[[carburettor]] sporter; only thirty were sold, against around three hundred of the SOHC model and 750 of the [[pushrod]]-six Type R. Duerkopp's Zoller-blown two liter in 1924, as well.<ref name="Georgano"/>

There was a clear cleavage by 1925. As four-seaters were more profitable, two-seaters increasingly turned over to specialist manufacturers, led by [[Alvis (car)|Alvis]], [[Aston-Martin]], and [[Frazer-Nash]], with shoestring budgets, fanatic followers, and limited sales (today exemplified by Aston and [[Morgan Motor Company|Morgan]]): between 1921 and 1939, 350 Astons were built; 323 Frazer-Nashes in the period 1924<U+2013>39.<ref name="Georgano"/>

By the end of the 1920s, [[AC Cars|AC]] produced a 2 liter six, the 3.5 liter [[Nazzaro]] had a three-valve OHC (only until 1922), while French makers [[Amilcar]], Bignan, [[Hispano-Suiza]], and Samson had the typical small four-cylinder sporters and [[Delage]], [[Hotchkiss (car)|Hotchkiss]], and [[Chenard-Walcker]] the large tourers. [[Benz & Cie.|Benz]] introduced the powerful SS and [[Mercedes-Benz SSK|SSK]], and [[Alfa Romeo]], the Vittorio Jano-designed [[Alfa Romeo 6C|6C]].<ref name="Georgano"/>

Two companies would offer the first really reliable sports cars: [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] with the [[Austin 7|Seven]] and [[MG Cars|Morris Garages]] (MG) with the [[MG Midget|Midget]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The Seven would quickly be "rodded" by numerous companies (as the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Type 1]] would be a generation later), including Bassett and Dingle (Hammersmith, London); in 1928, a Cozette blower was fitted to the Seven Super Sports, while [[Cecil Kimber]] fitted an 847 cc [[Morris Minor (1928)|Minor]] engine, and sold more Midgets in the first year than MG's entire previous production.<ref name="Georgano"/>

==Layout==
{{Refimprove|date=December 2010}}
[[File:Lotus Elan.jpg|thumb|1990s [[Lotus Elan|Lotus Elan M100]], a front-engine, front wheel (FF) drive sports car]]

The drive train and engine layout significantly influences the handling characteristics of an automobile, and is crucially important in the design of a sports car.

The [[front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout]] (FR) is common to sports cars of any era and has survived longer in sports cars than in mainstream automobiles. Examples include the [[Caterham Seven|Caterham 7]], [[Mazda MX-5]], and the [[Chevrolet Corvette]]. More specifically, many such sports cars have a [[Front mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout|FMR layout]], with the centre of mass of the engine between the front axle and the firewall.

In search of improved handling and weight distribution, other layouts are sometimes used. The [[Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|RMR layout]] is commonly found only in sports cars<U+2014>the motor is centre-mounted in the chassis (closer to and behind the driver), and powers only the rear wheels. Some high-performance sports car manufacturers, such as [[Ferrari]] and [[Lamborghini]] have preferred this layout.

[[Porsche]] is one of the few remaining manufacturers using the [[rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout]] (RR). The motor's distributed weight across the wheels, in a [[Porsche 911]], provides excellent traction, but the significant mass behind the rear wheels makes it more prone to oversteer in some situations. Porsche has continuously refined the design and in recent years added electronic driving aids (i.e. computerised traction-stability control) to counteract these inherent design shortcomings.<ref name="Early Handling Problems and Solutions">{{cite web | url = http://www.autozine.org/911/911_5.htm | title = Early Handling Problems and Solutions | accessdate = 2008-09-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120329100309/http://www.autozine.org/911/911_5.htm|archivedate=2012-03-29 }}</ref>

The [[front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout]] (FF) layout which is the most common in [[sport compact]]s and [[hot hatch]]es, and cars in general,  is not generally used for sports cars. This layout is advantageous for small, light, lower power sports cars, as it avoids the extra weight, increased transmission power loss, and packaging problems of a long driveshaft and longitudinal engine of FR vehicles. However, its conservative handling effect, particularly understeer, and the fact that many drivers believe rear wheel drive is a more desirable layout for a sports car count against it. The [[Fiat Barchetta]], [[Saab Sonett]] and [[Berkeley Cars|Berkeley cars]] are sports cars with this layout.

Before the 1980s few sports cars used [[four-wheel drive]], which had traditionally added a lot of weight. Although not a sports car, the [[Audi Quattro]] proved its worth in rallying. With its improvement in traction, particularly in adverse weather conditions, four-wheel drive is no longer uncommon in high-powered sports cars, e.g. [[Porsche]], [[Lamborghini]], and the [[Bugatti Veyron]].

==Seating==

''Some'' sports cars have small back seats that are really only suitable for luggage or small children. Such a configuration is often referred to as a [[2 plus 2|2+2]] (two full seats + two "occasional" seats). The more typical seating arrangement is two-seats.

Over the years, some manufacturers of sports cars have sought to increase the practicality of their vehicles by increasing the seating room. One method is to place the driver's seat in the center of the car, which allows two full-sized passenger seats on each side and slightly behind the driver. The arrangement was originally considered for the [[Lamborghini Miura]], but abandoned as impractical because of the difficulty for the driver to enter/exit the vehicle. [[McLaren Cars|McLaren]] used the design in their [[McLaren F1|F1]].

Another British manufacturer, [[TVR]], took a different approach in their Cerbera model. The interior was designed in such a way that the dashboard on the passenger side swept toward the front of the car, which allowed the passenger to sit farther forward than the driver. This gave the rear seat passenger extra room and made the arrangement suitable for three adult passengers and one child seated behind the driver. The arrangement has been referred to by the company as a 3+1.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Some [[Matra]] sports cars even had three seats squeezed next to each other.

A car may be a ''sporting'' automobile without being a sports car. Performance modifications of regular, production cars, such as [[sport compact]]s, [[sports sedan]]s, [[muscle car]]s, [[hot hatch]]es and the like, generally are not considered sports cars, yet share traits common to sports cars.  They are sometimes called "sports cars" for [[marketing]] purposes for increased advertising and promotional purposes.<ref>Crossa, Robert G. and Dixit, Ashutosh.
