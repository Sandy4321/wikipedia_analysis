==Reception==
The song received generally favorable reviews from contemporary [[Music journalism|music critics]].

Hachette Filipacchi (UK) Ltd}}</ref> David Buchanan of [[Consequence of Sound]] also agreed that "the [first two] singles are extraordinarily infectious, as is "Inside Out", which slows the tempo, simultaneously sending Spears back to basics vocally, and into 2011 sonically."<ref name=consequence>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2011/03/album-review-britney-spears-femme-fatale/|title=Album Review: Britney Spears <U+2013> Femme Fatale|last=Buchanan|first=David|date=March 22, 2011|accessdate=August 29, 2011|publisher=[[Consequence of Sound]]}}</ref> On her review of ''Femme Fatale'', Genevieve Koski of ''[[The A.V.
