"'''Mutual Core'''" is a song recorded by [[Iceland]]ic singer-songwriter [[Bj<U+00F6>rk]] for her seventh studio album ''[[Biophilia (album)|Biophilia]]'' (2011). It was written and produced by Bj<U+00F6>rk herself, while programming and beats were made in collaboration with [[Matthew Herbert]] and English dubstep band [[16bit]]. "Mutual Core" is an [[uptempo]] [[Experimental music|experimental]] song. Its music includes [[Pipe organ]], [[electronica]]-tinged sounds and features the [[Choir]] Graduale Nobili, the choir featured on ''Biophilia''. The song's lyrics are a metaphor for human relationships, compared to the structure of the [[Earth]] and [[Plate tectonics]]. The song was well received by contemporary [[Music journalism|music critics]], who compared its sound to the work of [[The Chemical Brothers]] and praised its production and beats, moreover appreciating Bj<U+00F6>rk's voice on the track.

As with all the songs on ''Biophilia'', an app was made for the song, which features a video game in which the player have to move geological layers as an [[accordion]] to play [[Chord (music)|chords]]. Though the song wasn't released as a single, a music video was produced, directed by Andrew Thomas Huang. Bj<U+00F6>rk promoted the song by performing it throughout her [[Biophilia Tour]].

Three remixes by [[Matthew Herbert]], 16bit and [[These New Puritans]] were released as part of ''[[Biophilia (album)#Biophilia Remix Series|Biophilia Remix Series]]''. The Matthew Herbert's and the These New Puritans remixes were later included on ''[[Bastards (Bj<U+00F6>rk album)|bastards]]'' (2012). On July 2012, the [[online music store]] [[Beatport]] announced a fan contest in which "Mutual Core" had to be remixed, to be released afterwards on a remix package.

Opposing forces of compression and release, central to continent building and to human feelings, are expressed sonically, and in the app, by the contrast between the shifting of chords in the verse and uplifting chorus.

Three official remixes of the song have been released.

The second one is a remix by 16bit, which was released as part of ''[[Biophilia (album)#Biophilia Remix Series|Biophilia Remix Series VII]]'' on July 9, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=remix series 7 out now|url=http://bjork.com/#/news/remixseries7outnow|accessdate=3 November 2012|publisher=Bjork.com}}</ref> This version had already been released as part of a promo for [[Icelandair]] flights, playing the song in flights to Iceland during Bj<U+00F6>rk's concert residency in Reykjavik in Summer 2011.

The rhythm of the song can be roughly divided into two distinct parts:<ref name=popmatters /> the [[Verse (music)|verses]], which feature moderately sparse electronic [[Beat (music)|beats]] and a time signature of 5/4, and the [[Song structure (popular music)#Chorus|choruses]], which display more [[Beat (music)|upbeat]] sounds and a 2/4 time signature.<ref name=manual /> According to Mark Diver of [[BBC Music]] during the shift from the verse and the chorus the song "slips from blissful ambience into bombastic electronic percussion, leaving the senses reeling, only to fade back into a comforting lilt".<ref name=bbc />

The instrumentation of the verses includes a [[pipe organ]].<ref name=popmatters /><ref name=telegraphy /> Sound designer David Paterson described the way Bj<U+00F6>rk wanted the music on "Mutual Core": "Bjork described the sounds she wanted in a way that left it very open to interpretation. With the track "Mutual Core", for example, she described how it was about magnetic attraction <U+2013> which doesn<U+2019>t really have a sound that springs to mind".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Burrows|first=Tim|title=MATTHEW HERBERT & DAVID PATERSON|journal=Dazed & Confused|publisher=Waddell Limited|date=4 July 2011|volume=200|issue=Bj<U+00F6>rk shows you the future}}</ref> Luke Turner of ''[[NME]]'' noted that "[Bj<U+00F6>rk's] voice cracks against the increasing, insistent power of the electronic rhythms, as if recognising our human insignificance in the face of geology", citing the verse "As fast as your fingernail grows / The Atlantic ridge drifts" as an example,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=Luke|title=Bjork Biophilia|work=NME|publisher=IPC Media|date=8 October 2011}}</ref> and, on a similar note, Odile De Plas of ''[[T<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>rama]]'' found the singer's voice "strong, acrobat, guttural and [...] crystalline".<ref>{{cite journal|last=De Plas|first=Odile|title=Digitale Diva|journal=[[T<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>rama]]|publisher=[[Le Monde]] S.A|date=14 September 2011}}</ref>

The musical shift occurs when the singer pronounces the words "Core", during which, as described by Nikki Debben in her essay included in the Manual Edition of ''Biophilia'', the "modality switches from [[Minor scale|minor]] to [[Major scale|major]]".<ref name=manual /> The lecturer noted that "the close, dark sound of the verse is partly due to the minor mode which has a [[Flat (music)|flattened third degree]], compared to the brighter sound of the chorus in the major mode which has the "normal" third degree of the chord".<ref name=manual /> This part of the song uses a [[Plagal cadence]], which involves a movement "from a chord built on the fourth degree of the scale to one built on the first degree of the scale".<ref name=manual /> The chorus of the song features a vocal [[crescendo]] performed by the choir, which juxtaposes with [[breakcore]]-influenced beats, which display elements from [[Dub (music)|dub]].<ref name=wearstrouserss /> Chris Chafin of ''Capital'' compared the sound of the chorus to the work of [[The Chemical Brothers]] and stated that tracks like "Crystalline" and "Mutual Core" recall previous works from Bj<U+00F6>rk's discography, especially ''[[Post (Bj<U+00F6>rk album)|Post]]'' (1995) and ''[[Homogenic]]'' (1997).<ref name=capital />

==Critical reception==
The song was generally well received by [[Music journalism|music critics]], who cited it as a highlight of the album. According to Mark Pytlik of [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]], the song "may be the album<U+2019>s best track overall", citing "its satisfyingly filthy electro skronk",<ref name="pitchy">{{cite web|last=Pytlik|first=Mark|title=Bj<U+00F6>rk Biophilia|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15915-biophilia/|publisher=Pitchfork.

<blockquote>Her unique utility of the English language gives her words a quirky, idiosyncratic edge, allowing lines like [[Bachelorette (song)|<U+201C>if you forget my name, you<U+2019>ll go astray/ like a killer whale<U+201D>]] to ring somehow striking. Said masterstrokes and quirks are well intact here, as is evident in the asteroid-bass volley of "Mutual Core" and lead single "Crystalline"<U+2018>s apocalyptical breakbeat coda.
Biophilia<U+2018>s finest moments are its most subtly captivating, many of which are (admittedly) almost forgettable on first listen. The aforementioned "Mutual Core" and "Crystalline" can be assured a spot on any and all future Best of Bj<U+00F6>rk compilations, compelling in how they blend archaic instrumentation with blistering electronica.<ref name=consound>{{cite web|last=Choudhery|first=M<U+00F6>hammed|title=Album Review: Bj<U+00F6>rk <U+2013> Biophilia|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2011/10/album-review-bjork-biophilia/|publisher=[[Consequence of Sound]]|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=7 October 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

In musicology-wise this is to teach you about chords, and you can use [..] the tectonic plates, the strata inside them, and it sorta operates like accordion so you can change the chords and push them together and [...] create a mutual core.<ref name="youtubetutorial"/></blockquote>

===Background and development===
[[File:Mutual Core Video Poster.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Promotional poster for the music video for "Mutual Core".]]
A music video for the song was commissioned by the director of Los Angeles' [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] (MOCA), Jeffrey Deitch.<ref name=huff /><ref name=papermag>{{cite web|last=Pasternack|first=Alex|title=Bj<U+00F6>rk's Vision Quest|url=http://www.papermag.com/2012/11/bjork_vision_quest_art_music.php|work=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]|publisher=Paper Publishing Inc|accessdate=9 November 2012}}</ref> The video was first revealed to be in the making in the September 2012 issue of ''[[Dazed & Confused (magazine)|Dazed & Confused]]'', in an interview with Andrew Thomas Huang.<ref name=dazedvideo>{{cite news|last=Orton|first=Karen|title=Bj<U+00F6>rk selects Andrew Thomas Huang|url=http://www.bjork.fr/Dazed-Confused-sept-2012|accessdate=2 November 2012|date=1 September 2012|publisher=Bjork.fr}}</ref> Huang was revealed to be chosen as the director for the video by [[Bj<U+00F6>rk]] herself.<ref name=dazedvideo /> Huang said about the making process:
<blockquote>"There's a lot of volcanic and earthy stuff in the video, we put Bj<U+00F6>rk in quite a few uncomfortable set-ups when we were filming, but she was game for anything. She was a lot of fun and just very warm and trusting."<ref name=dazedvideo/></blockquote>

The director also hinted at a parallelism between the video and its short film ''Solipsist'', which was released weeks before the shooting of "Mutual Core" video: "[The song] is a metaphor between earth<U+2019>s crust and two people converging, and the effort that it takes, that was also what ''Solipsist'' was about, so working together made sense".<ref name=dazedvideo /> The video was shot in Reykjav<U+00ED>k in over two days.<ref name=style>{{cite web|last=Brunswick|first=Alexis|title="Core" Strength|url=http://www.style.com/stylefile/2012/11/core-strength/|publisher=[[Style.com]].

Her costumes were inspired by [[Thailand|Thai]] and [[Indonesia]]n costumes, while the substance which resembles magma that she appears to spit in the video was a computer-modified mixture of [[ketchup]] and cake batter.<ref name=gporn /> 

A teaser trailer has been released on 5 November 2012.

===Synopsis===
[[File:Mutual Core Video.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A screenshot from the music video where Bj<U+04E7>rk sings surrounded by rocks under a rain of ashes.]]
In the beginning of the video, soil crubles down, as Bj<U+00F6>rk appears, buried to her waist in the sand, wearing a golden dress (by [[Michael van der Ham]]),<ref name=style /> a [[brooch]] on her shoulder designed by the singer herself<ref name=gporn>{{cite web|last=Jabr|first=Ferris|title=Geology Porn: The Science and Art of Bjork<U+2019>s "Mutual Core" Music Video|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/brainwaves/2012/11/15/geology-porn-the-science-and-art-of-bjorks-mutual-core-music-video/|work=[[Scientific American]]|publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]]|accessdate=16 January 2013|date=15 November 2012}}</ref> and a blue wig, holding a rock. As she starts singing, she divides the rock into two pieces. As she waves the pieces, the sand around her stirs. She then lays the two pieces on the sand, and they become part of two rock sprites, that come out of the sand and start writhing around Bj<U+00F6>rk, while strata emerges from them. In the end of the first verse, the strata of the two rocky sprites try to unite, as Bj<U+00F6>rk grabs the sand and let it slips out from her fingers. During the second verse other rocks emerge from the sand and revolve around Bj<U+00F6>rk, who dances in the sand. Other rocky sprites spring out of the new rocks and link to the main two, which are still spinning around the singer's head. The two parts are irresistibly attracted to each other and try to unite as they are stroked by Bj<U+00F6>rk. The strata of the rocks morphes to form a face, similar to that of the singer. As the chorus begins, Bj<U+00F6>rk disappears in the darkness. The two rocky parts, now united, start to bestir themself, whilst various rocks on the sand start to erupt. [[Lava]], [[magma]], smoke and fire storm while Bj<U+00F6>rk's face appears in the lava. Every rocks erupt noisily, causing a rain of [[volcanic ash]].

The video shifts again to Bj<U+00F6>rk buried in the sand under the rain of ashes. The two pieces of rock appear again, this time each one with a Bj<U+00F6>rk-shaped strata. The strata also sing parts of the song, and two arms come out from the floating rocks and their hands barely brush against each other. The rocks unite once again as the chorus begins for the second time. During this part of the video, images of Bj<U+00F6>rk singing in a smoky setting alternate with more rocks uniting to the main two, while their Bj<U+00F6>rk-shaped strata secrete a substance similar to lava from their mouth. All the rocks are now united, forming a big [[volcano]], whose [[Volcanic crater|crater]] is shaped like two opposite Bj<U+00F6>rk-shaped rocks. The volcano finally erupts in an explosion of magma, while a [[thunderstorm]] occurs in the background. The video ends as the volcano fades out and all that remains visible is ash and smoke.

===Reception and accolades===
The video was heavily praised by critics. Bob Boilen of What Matters commented that the video is "a bit weird and smartly done".<ref>{{cite web|last=Boilen|first=Bob|title=First Watch: Bjork, 'Mutual Core (Remix)'|url=http://wbaa.org/post/first-watch-bjork-mutual-core-remix|publisher=What Matters|accessdate=16 January 2013|date=13 November 2012}}</ref> Tom Breihan of [[Stereogum]] stated that the video is "a beguilingly strange vision" and that "as the song unfolds, the images reach an explosive conclusion that resembles a fucked-up metal album cover",<ref>{{cite web|last=Breihan|first=Tom|title=Bj<U+00F6>rk <U+2013> "Mutual Core" Video|url=http://stereogum.com/1198992/bjork-mutual-core-video/video/|publisher=[[Stereogum]].
