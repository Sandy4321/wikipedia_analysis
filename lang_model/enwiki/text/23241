'''Mary Toft''' [n<U+00E9>e Denyer] (c.&nbsp;1701&ndash;1763), also called '''Mary Tofts''', was an [[England|English]] woman from [[Godalming]], [[Surrey]], who in 1726 became the subject of considerable controversy when she [[hoax]]ed doctors into believing that she had given birth to [[rabbit]]s.

Toft became pregnant in 1726, but later [[miscarriage|miscarried]].  Apparently fascinated by a rabbit she had seen while working, she claimed to have given birth to parts of animals.  Local surgeon John Howard was called to investigate, and upon delivering several animal parts he notified other prominent physicians.  The matter came to the attention of Nathaniel St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9>, surgeon to the [[Royal Household]] of King [[George I of Great Britain]].  St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9> investigated and concluded that Toft was telling the truth.  The king also sent surgeon [[Cyriacus Ahlers]] to see Toft, but Ahlers remained sceptical.  By now quite famous, Toft was brought to London and was studied at length.  Under intense scrutiny, and producing no more rabbits, she eventually confessed to the hoax and was subsequently imprisoned.

The public mockery which followed created panic within the medical profession.  Several prominent surgeons' careers were ruined, and many [[satire|satirical]] works were produced, each scathingly critical of the affair.  The pictorial satirist and social critic [[William Hogarth]] was notably critical of the gullibility of the medical profession.  Toft was eventually released without charge and returned to her home.

==Account==
The story first came to the attention of the public in late October 1726, when reports began to reach [[London]].<ref name="Toddp27">{{Harvnb|Todd|1982|p=27}}</ref>  It was mentioned in the ''[[Weekly Journal]]'', on 19&nbsp;November 1726:<!-- Mist's Weekly Journal according to [http://rictornorton.co.uk/grubstreet/rabbit.htm] -->

{{Quote|From Guildford comes a strange but well-attested Piece of News.  That a poor Woman who lives at Godalmin [sic], near that Town, was about a Month past delivered by Mr John Howard, an Eminent Surgeon and Man-Midwife, of a creature resembling a Rabbit but whose Heart and Lungs grew without its Belly, about 14 Days since she was delivered by the same Person, of a perfect Rabbit: and in a few Days after of 4 more; and on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, the 4th, 5th, and 6th instant, of one in each day: in all nine, they died all in bringing into the World.  The woman hath made Oath, that two Months ago, being working in a Field with other Women, they put up a Rabbit, who running from them, they pursued it, but to no Purpose: This created in her such a Longing to it, that she (being with Child) was taken ill and miscarried, and from that Time she hath not been able to avoid thinking of Rabbits.  People after all, differ much in their Opinion about this Matter, some looking upon them as great Curiosities, fit to be presented to the Royal Society, etc. others are angry at the Account, and say, that if it be a Fact, a Veil should be drawn over it, as an Imperfection in human Nature.|''Weekly Journal'', 19&nbsp;November 1726<ref>{{Harvnb|Haslam|1996|pp=30&ndash;31}}</ref>}}

The [[protagonist]], Mary Toft, was between twenty-four and twenty-five years old, and married to Joshua Toft, a [[journeyman]] clothier.<ref name="Uglow">{{Harvnb|Uglow|1997|pp=118&ndash;119, 121}}</ref>  She was baptised Mary Denyer on 21&nbsp;February 1703, the daughter of John and Jane Denyer.

Early in August, she egested several pieces of flesh, one "as big as my arm". This may have been the result of an abnormality of the developing [[placenta]], which caused the embryo to stop developing and blood clots and flesh to be ejected.<ref name="Toddmonstersp6">{{Harvnb|Todd|1995|p=6}}</ref><ref name="Toft confession"/><ref name="Haslamp30">{{Harvnb|Haslam|1996|p=30}}</ref>  Several weeks later, on 27&nbsp;September, she went into [[Childbirth|labour]].  Her neighbour was called, and watched as Toft produced several animal parts.  She showed the pieces to her mother, and to her mother-in-law Ann Toft, who, by chance, was a [[Midwifery|midwife]].  Ann Toft sent the pieces to John Howard, a man-midwife of thirty years experience, who lived in [[Guildford]].<ref name="Toddmonstersp6"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Cody|2005|p=125}}</ref>

Initially Howard dismissed the notion out-of-hand, but despite his reservations, the next day he went to see Toft.  Ann Toft showed him further pieces of the previous night's exertions, but when he examined Mary, he found nothing.  She then began to go into labour, and appeared to give birth to several more animal parts.  Howard returned the next day, and continued his investigations.  According to a contemporary account of 9&nbsp;November, over the next few days he [[Childbirth|delivered]] "three legs of a Cat of a Tabby Colour, and one leg of a Rabbet: the guts were as a Cat's and in them were three pieces of the Back-Bone of an Eel&nbsp;... The cat's feet supposed were formed in her imagination from a cat she was fond of that slept on the bed at night."  Later Toft seemingly became ill again, and during the next few days delivered more pieces of rabbit.<ref name="Toddmonstersp6"/><ref name="Haslamp30"/>

As the story became more widely known, on 4&nbsp;November [[Henry Davenant]], a member of the court of King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], went to Guildford to see what was happening for himself.  He examined the samples that Howard had collected, and returned to London, ostensibly a believer.  Howard had Toft moved to [[Guildford]], where he offered to deliver rabbits in front of anyone who doubted the veracity of the story.<ref>{{Harvnb|Seligman|1961|p=350}}</ref><ref name="Haslamp31">{{Harvnb|Haslem|1996|p=31}}</ref>  He wrote several letters notifying Davenant of any progress in the case.  Some of these came to the attention of [[Nathaniel St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9>]], since 1723 a [[Swiss]] surgeon to the [[Royal Household]].<ref name="Toddmonstersp9">{{Harvnb|Todd|1995|p=9}}</ref>  St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9> detailed the contents of one of these letters in his pamphlet, ''A short narrative of an extraordinary delivery of rabbets'' (1727) (published several weeks after the event):

{{Quote|SIR,

==Investigation==
[[File:GeorgeIKneller1714.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A three quarter portrait of a man, seated, hands rested on the arms of the chair, wearing expensive clothing and a wig.  Behind him to his right, is a crown, its cross and arches prominent.|King George I (pictured) was fascinated by the story of Toft]]
By the middle of November, the [[British Royal Family]] were so interested in the story that they sent St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9> and Samuel Molyneux (secretary to the [[Prince of Wales]]) to investigate.  They were, apparently, not disappointed; arriving on 15&nbsp;November they met Howard, who took them to see Toft, who within hours delivered the torso of a rabbit.<ref name="Toddp27"/>  St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9>'s account details his examination.  To check if the rabbit had breathed air, he placed a piece of its lung in water to see if it would float<U+2014>which it did.  St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9> then performed a medical examination on Toft, and concluded that the rabbits were bred in her [[Fallopian tubes]].  In the doctors' absence, Toft reportedly delivered the torso of another rabbit later that day, which the two also examined.<ref name="Haslamp31"/><ref>{{Harvnb|St. Andr<U+00E9>|Howard|1727|pp=7&ndash;12}}</ref>  They again returned that evening to find Toft again displaying violent [[contraction (childbirth)|contractions]].  A further medical examination followed, and St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9> delivered the skin of one of the rabbits, followed a few minutes later by the head.  Both men inspected the rabbit parts, and noted that some resembled the body parts of a cat.<ref>{{Harvnb|St. Andr<U+00E9>|Howard|1727|pp=12&ndash;14}}</ref>

Fascinated, in the same month the king sent another surgeon, [[Cyriacus Ahlers]], to see Toft.  Ahlers arrived in Guildford on 20&nbsp;November to find Toft exhibiting no signs of pregnancy.  Ahlers may have already suspected the affair was a hoax, and observed that Toft seemed to press her knees and thighs together, as if to prevent something from "dropping down".  Howard's behaviour was similarly suspicious, as he refused to allow Ahlers to aid in the delivery of the rabbits (although Ahlers was not a man-midwife, and in an earlier attempt he apparently put Toft through considerable pain).<ref name="Seligmanp352">{{Harvnb|Seligman|1961|p=352}}</ref>  Convinced the affair was a hoax he lied, telling those involved that he believed Toft's story.  He made his excuses and returned to London, taking with him specimens of the rabbits.  Upon closer study, he reportedly found evidence of them having been cut with a man-made instrument, and he also found bits of straw and grain in their droppings.<ref name="Toddmonsterspp1819">{{Harvnb|Todd|1995|pp=18&ndash;19}}</ref><ref name="Toddp27"/>

On 21&nbsp;November Ahlers reported his findings to the King and later to "several Persons of Note and Distinction".<ref>{{Harvnb|Todd|1995|p=19}}</ref>  The next day, Howard wrote to Ahlers, asking for the return of the specimens he had taken with him.<ref name="Toddmonsterspp1819"/>  Ahler's suspicions began to worry both Howard and St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9>, and apparently the King, because two days later St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9> and a colleague were ordered back to Guildford.<ref name="Seligmanp352"/><ref name="Toddp28">{{Harvnb|Todd|1982|p=28}}</ref>  Upon their arrival they met Howard, who told St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9> that Toft had given birth to two additional rabbits.  She delivered several of what the men presumed to be portions of a placenta; the two men found her to be quite ill, with a constant pain in the right side of her abdomen.<ref name="Seligmanp352"/><ref>{{Harvnb|St. Andr<U+00E9>|Howard|1727|pp=28&ndash;30}}</ref>  In a pre-emptive move against Ahlers, St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9> collected several [[affidavit]]s from people who had witnessed Ahlers' behaviour.  These affidavits in effect cast doubt on Ahlers' honesty, and on 26&nbsp;November St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9> gave an anatomical demonstration before the king, supporting Toft's story.<ref name="Toddp28"/><ref>{{Harvnb|St. Andr<U+00E9>|Howard|1727|pp=20&ndash;21}}</ref>  According to his pamphlet, neither St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9> or Molyneux suspected any fraudulent activity.<ref>{{Harvnb|St. Andr<U+00E9>|Howard|1727|p=32}}</ref>

Several days later Howard again wrote to St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9>, who then travelled to Guildford (ordered by the king to return to London with Toft, so that further investigations could be carried out).  He was accompanied by [[Richard Manningham]], a well-known [[obstetrician]] who had been [[knighted]] in 1721, and who was the second son of the [[Bishop of Chichester]].<ref name="Seligmanp352"/>  He examined Toft and found the right side of her abdomen to be slightly enlarged.  While there, Manningham delivered what he thought was a hog's bladder (although St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9> and Howard did not agree with his identification).  Manningham became suspicious as the bladder smelled of [[urine]], but those involved agreed to say nothing in public, and on their return to London on 29&nbsp;November lodged Toft in Lacey's [[Bagnio]], in Leicester Fields.<ref name="Toddp28"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Seligman|1961|p=354}}</ref><ref name="Codyp126">{{Harvnb|Cody|2005|p=126}}</ref>

==Examination==

Printed in the early days of [[newspaper]]s, the story became a national sensation.  Some publications were sceptical; the ''[[Norwich Gazette]]'' viewed the story simply as female gossip.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cody|2005|p=135}}</ref>  Rabbit stew and [[Jugging|jugged]] hare disappeared from the dinner table.  As unlikely as the story sounded, many physicians felt compelled to see for themselves. The political writer [[John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey|John Hervey]] later told his friend Henry Fox that:

{{quote|Every creature in town, both men and women, have been to see and feel her: the perpetual emotions, noises and rumblings in her Belly are something prodigious; all the eminent physicians, surgeons and man-midwives in London are there Day and Night to watch her next production.|John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey|<ref name="Uglow"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Cody|2005|pp=127&ndash;128}}</ref>}}
Under the strict control of St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9>, Toft was studied by a number of eminent physicians and surgeons.  [[John Maubray]] was one such visitor.  In ''The Female Physician'' he had proposed that it was possible for women to give birth to a creature he named a [[Sooterkin]].  Maubray was a proponent of [[maternal impression]], a widely-held belief that conception and pregnancy could be influenced by what the mother dreamt, or saw.<ref>{{Citation | last = Toor | first = Kiran | title = <U+2018>Offspring of his Genius<U+2019>: Coleridge's Pregnant Metaphors and Metamorphic Pregnancies, published in ''Romanticism'' | url = http://www.eupjournals.com/doi/abs/10.3366/rom.2007.13.3.257?cookieSet=1&journalCode=rom | publisher = eupjournals.com | doi = 10.3366/rom.2007.13.3.257 | page = 257&mdash;270}}</ref>  Maubray also warned pregnant women that over-familiarity with household pets could cause their children to resemble those pets.  He was reportedly happy to attend Toft, pleased that her case appeared to vindicate his theories.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bondeson|1997|pp=129&ndash;131}}</ref>  Man-midwife [[James Douglas (physician)|James Douglas]] however, like Manningham, presumed that the affair was a hoax and kept his distance despite regular invitations to attend from St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9>.  Douglas was one of the most respected anatomists in the country, and a well-known man-midwife, whereas St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9> was often considered to be a member of the court only because of his ability to speak [[German language|German]] (the King could not speak English).<ref>{{Harvnb|Todd|1995|p=26}}</ref>  St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9> therefore desperately wanted the two to attend Toft; after [[George I of Great Britain|George I]]'s accession to the throne the [[Whig (British political faction)|Whig]]s had become the dominant political faction, and Manningham and Douglas' Whig affiliations and medical knowledge would elevate his status as both doctor, and philosopher.<ref name="Codyp126"/>  Despite his early scepticism (Douglas thought that a woman giving birth to rabbits was as likely as a rabbit giving birth to a human child), Douglas went to see Toft.  Manningham informed him of the suspected hog's bladder, and, after examining Toft, he refused to engage St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9> on the matter:<ref>{{Harvnb|Bondeson|1997|p=132}}</ref>

{{Quote|To be able to determine, to the Satisfaction and Conviction of all sorts of Persons, other Arguments were necessary, than Anatomy, or any other Branch of Physick [sic], could furnish.

Under constant supervision, Toft went into labour several times, but nothing was delivered.<ref name="Toddp29">{{Harvnb|Todd|1982|p=29}}</ref>

==Confession==
The hoax was uncovered on 4&nbsp;December.  [[Thomas Onslow, 2nd Baron Onslow|Thomas Onslow]] had begun an investigation of his own and discovered that for the past month Joshua Toft had been buying young rabbits.  Convinced he had enough evidence against Toft, in a letter to physician [[Hans Sloane]] he wrote that the affair had "almost alarmed England", and that he would soon publish his findings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Caulfield|Collection|1819|pp=199&ndash;200}}</ref><ref name="Uglow"/>  On the same day, Thomas Howard, a [[Porter (carrier)|porter]] at the bagnio, confessed to Sir [[Thomas Clarges]] (a [[Justice of the Peace]]) that he had been bribed to sneak a rabbit into Toft's chamber by Toft's sister-in-law, Margaret.  Mary was arrested and questioned; she denied the accusation but Margaret claimed under questioning by James Douglas that she had obtained the rabbit for eating only.<ref name="Seligmanp355">{{Harvnb|Seligman|1961|p=355}}</ref>

{{Quote|I told my sister of my having sent for a rabbit and I desire[d] her to give it to the porter to be carryed [sic] away which my sister did saying she would not have it known for 1000 p[oun]d[s].|Mary Toft<ref name="Toft confession"/>}}

Manningham examined her and thought there was still something in the cavity of the uterus.  He successfully persuaded Clarges to allow Toft to remain at the bagnio.<ref name="Seligmanp355"/>  Douglas, who was by now visiting Toft, questioned her on three or four occasions, each time for several hours.  After several days of this Manningham threatened to perform a painful operation on her, and on 7&nbsp;December, in the presence of Manningham, Douglas, [[John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu|John Montagu]] and [[Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore|Frederick Calvert]], Toft finally confessed.<ref name="Seligmanp356"/><ref name="Uglow"/>  Following her miscarriage, and while her [[cervix]] permitted access, an accomplice had inserted the claws and body of a cat, along with the head of a rabbit, into her womb.  They had also invented a story in which Toft claimed that during her pregnancy she had been startled by a rabbit while working in a field, and had since become obsessed with rabbits.  For later parturitions, animal parts had been inserted into her vagina.<ref>{{Harvnb|Todd|1995|p=7}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Haslam|1996|p=34}}</ref>

Pressured again by Manningham and Douglas (it was Douglas that took down her confession), she made a further confession on 8&nbsp;December, and another on 9&nbsp;December before being sent to [[Tothill Fields Bridewell]], charged on a statute of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] as a "vile cheat and imposter".<ref name="Seligmanp356">{{Harvnb|Seligman|1961|p=356}}</ref><ref name="Brockp168">{{Harvnb|Brock|1974|p=168}}</ref><ref name="Toddp29"/>  In her earlier, unpublished confessions, she blamed the entire affair on a range of other participants, from her mother-in-law to John Howard.  She also claimed that a travelling woman told her how to insert the rabbits into her body, and how such a scheme would ensure that she would "never want as long as I liv'd".<ref name="Toft confession">{{Citation | title = Three confessions of Mary Toft | location = Hunterian Collection of the Library of the University of Glasgow, Bundle 20, Blackburn Cabinet, shelf listings R.1.d., R.1.f., R.1.g.}}</ref>  The ''British Journal'' reported that on 7 January 1727 she had appeared at the [[Quarter Sessions|Courts of Quarter Sessions]] at [[Westminster]], charged "for being an abominable cheat and imposter in pretending to be delivered of several monstrous births".<ref name="ToftHowardCourt">{{Citation | title = Report on Margaret Toft | publisher = ''[[British Journal]]'' | date = 1727-01-14}}</ref>  Margaret Toft however had remained staunch, and refused to comment further.  ''Mist's Weekly Journal'' of 24 December 1726 reported "the nurse has been examined as to the person's concerned with her, but either was kept in the dark as to the imposition, or is not willing to disclose what she knows; for nothing can be got from her; so that her resolution shocks others."<ref>{{Citation | title = Report on Margaret Toft | publisher = ''[[Nathaniel Mist|Mist's Weekly Journal]]'' | date = 1726-12-24}}</ref>

==Aftermath==

In the aftermath of the hoax, the medical profession suffered a great deal of public mockery for its gullibility. [[William Hogarth]] published ''Cunicularii, or The Wise Men of Godliman in Consultation'' (1726), which portrays Toft in the throes of [[Childbirth|labour]], surrounded by the chief participants of the tale.  Figure "F" is Toft, "E" is her husband.  "A" is St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9>, and "D" is Howard.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haslam|1996|pp=28&ndash;29}}</ref><ref name="Paulsonp168"/><ref name="Toddp30">{{Harvnb|Todd|1982|p=30}}</ref>  In ''Three Characters in Hogarth's Cunicularii and Some Implications'' (1982) by Dennis Todd, the author concludes that figure "G" is Mary Toft's sister-in-law, Margaret Toft.  In her confession of 7&nbsp;December, Mary Toft was insistent that her sister-in-law had no part in the hoax, but Manningham's ''An Exact Diary of what was observ'd during a Close Attendance upon Mary Toft, the pretended Rabbet-Breeder of Godalming in Surrey'' (1726) offers eyewitness testimony of Margaret's complicity.<ref name="Toddp32">{{Harvnb|Todd|1982|p=32}}</ref>  Hogarth's print was not the only image that ridiculed the affair<U+2014>[[George Vertue]] published ''The Surrey-Wonder'', and ''The Doctors in Labour, or a New Wim-Wam in Guildford (12 plates)'' (1727), a broadsheet of twelve scenes satirising St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9> as a [[jester]], was also popular at the time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haslam|1996|p=45}}</ref>

The timing of Toft's confession proved awkward for St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9>, who, on 3&nbsp;December, had published his forty-page pamphlet: ''A Short Narrative of an Extraordinary Delivery of Rabbets''.<ref name="Toddp30"/>  St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9> had staked his reputation on his publication, and although it offers a more empirical account of the Toft case than earlier more fanciful publications about reproduction in general, ultimately it became the source of much derision.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cody|2005|pp=126&ndash;127}}</ref>  Ahlers, his scepticism now justified, published ''Some observations concerning the woman of Godlyman in Surrey'' (1726), which details his account of events and his suspicion of the complicity of both St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9> and Howard.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ahlers|1726|pp=1&ndash;23}}</ref>

St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9> never recovered from the affair.  He recanted his views on 9&nbsp;December 1726, and in 1729, following the death of Samuel Molyneux from poisoning, he married his widow Elizabeth<U+2014>a situation which did little to impress his peers.<ref>{{Citation | title = ''Daily Journal'' | publisher = ''Daily Journal'' | date = 1726-12-09}}</ref><ref name="Codyp132">{{Harvnb|Cody|2005|p=132}}</ref>  Samuel Molyneux's cousin accused him of the poisoning, a charge that St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9> defended by suing for [[defamation]], but the careers of St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9> and his wife were permanently damaged by the scandal.

Crowds reportedly mobbed Tothill Fields Bridewell for months, hoping to catch a glimpse of the now infamous woman who had by this time become quite ill.  While incarcerated she had her portrait drawn by [[John Laguerre]], while holding a rabbit on her lap.  She was ultimately discharged on 8&nbsp;April 1727, as it was unclear as to what charge should have been made.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cody|2005|p=130}}</ref>  The Toft family made no profit from the affair, and Mary Toft returned to Surrey.  She had a daughter in February 1727, and reappeared briefly in 1740 when she was imprisoned for receiving stolen goods, but was later reported to have died in 1763.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bondeson|1997|p=141}}</ref><ref name="Haslamp43">{{Harvnb|Haslam|1996|p=43}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Cody|2005|pp=131&ndash;132}}</ref>

The case was cited by opponents of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] [[Robert Walpole]] as symbolising the age, which they perceived as greedy, corrupt, and deceitful.  One author, writing to the Prince of Wales' mistress, suggested the story was a political portent of the approaching death of the prince's father.  On 7&nbsp;January 1727 ''[[Nathaniel Mist|Mist's Weekly Journal]]'' satirised the matter, making several allusions to political change, and compared the affair to the events in 1641, when Parliament began its revolution against King [[Charles I of England]].<ref name="Codyp131">{{Harvnb|Cody|2005|p=131}}</ref>  The scandal provided the writers of [[Grub Street]] with enough material to produce pamphlets, [[Squib (linguistics)|squibs]], broadsides, and ballads, for several months.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bondeson|1997|p=134}}</ref>  With publications such as ''St.&nbsp;Andr<U+00E9>'s Miscarriage'' (1727) and ''The anatomist dissected: or the man-midwife finely brought to bed'' (1727) satirists scorned the objectivity of men-midwives, and critics of Toft's attendants questioned their integrity, undermining their profession by introducing sexual puns and allusions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cody|2005|pp=132&ndash;134}}</ref>  The case raised questions about England's status as an "enlightened" nation<U+2014>[[Voltaire]] used the the case in his brief essay ''Singularit<U+00E9>s de la nature'' to describe how the Protestant English were still influenced by an ignorant Church.<ref>{{Harvnb|Voltaire|1785|p=428}}</ref>

Toft did not escape the ire of the satirists, who concentrated mainly on sexual innuendo.  Some took advantage of a common 18th-century word for a rabbit track&mdash;prick&mdash;and others were scatological in nature.  ''Much Ado about Nothing; or, A Plain Refutation of All that Has Been Written or Said Concerning the Rabbit-Woman of Godalming'' (1727) was however one of the more cutting satires written about Toft.  The document supposes to be the confession of 'Merry Tuft', "...in her own Stile and Spelling".  Poking fun at her illiteracy, it makes a number of obscene suggestions hinting at her promiscuity&mdash;"I wos a Wuman as had grate nattural parts, and a large Capassiti, and kapible of being kunserned in depe Kuntrivansis."  <ref>{{Harvnb|Lynch|2008|pp=33&mdash;34}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Tuft|1727|pp=12&mdash;17}}</ref>  The document also ridicules several of the physicians involved in the affair, and reflects the general view portrayed by the satirists that Toft was a weak woman, and the least complicit of 'the offenders' (regardless of her guilt).  This notion contrasts with that expressed of her before the hoax was revealed, and may indicate an overall strategy to disempower Toft completely.  This is reflected in one of the most notable satires of the affair, [[Alexander Pope]] and [[William Pulteney]]'s anonymous satirical ballad ''The Discovery; or, The Squire Turn'd Ferret''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Todd|1995|pp=69&ndash;72}}</ref>  Published in 1726 and aimed at Samuel Molyneux, it rhymes 'hare' with 'hair', and 'coney' with 'cunny'.  The ballad however opens with the following verse:<ref>{{Harvnb|Cox|2004|p=195}}</ref><ref name="Squire">{{Harvnb|Pope|Butt|1966|p=478}}</ref>
