==History==

''Chillenden windmill'' was built in by Holman's of [[Canterbury]]<ref name=Time>{{cite web| url= http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=628| publisher = Engineering Timelines| title = Chillenden Mill | accessdate= 2008-04-15}}</ref> in 1868, replacing an earlier post mill that had blown down. The new mill incorporated some material from the old one.<ref name=Finch/> A windmill was marked on Philip Symonson's map of 1596, [[John Speed|John Speed's]] map of 1611, [[Robert Morden|Robert Morden's]] map of 1695, E Bowen's map of 1736, Andrews, Drury and Herbert's map of 1769 and all [[Ordnance Survey]] maps from 1819. Holman's, the Canterbury [[millwright]]s fitted a new stock and two new sails in 1927,<ref name=Finch/> and the mill was working until 1949, when it lost a sail in a gale. Local people raised some money in 1955 to make the mill weatherproof, and on [[12 December]] [[1957]] the mill was bought for <U+00A3>100<ref name=Arch2>{{cite web| url= http://www.millsarchive.com/aspx/secured/item.aspx?intItemID=24990&strTitle=Conveyance%20of%20the%20mill%20and%20site%20to%20KCC%20(3%20of%206)| publisher = The Mills Archive Trust| title = Conveyance of the mill and site to KCC (3 of 6)| accessdate= 2008-04-15}}</ref>  by [[Kent County Council]] and restored at a cost of <U+00A3>728<ref name=Brown>{{cite book | first = R J| last = Brown| year = 1976| title = Windmills of England| pages = p96-97| publisher = Robert Hale| location = London| id = ISBN 0 7091 5641 3}}</ref>
, although some machinery was removed.<ref name=West>{{cite book | first = Jenny| last = West| year = 1973| title = The Windmills of Kent| pages = p32-35| publisher = Charles Skilton Ltd.| location = London| id = SBN 284-98534-1}}</ref>

==Collapse and rebuilding==

[[Image:Chillenden windmill blown down.jpg|thumb|The mill after collapse.]][[Image:Chillenden mill part frame.jpg|thumb|The partly rebuilt frame]][[Image:Chillenden windmill frame.jpg|thumb|The re-erected frame]]''Chillenden windmill'' collapsed on [[26 November]] [[2003]].<ref name=BBC>{{cite web| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/3240320.stm| publisher = BBC News Online| title = Windmill blown over in storm| accessdate= 2008-04-15}}</ref> The cause of the mill collapsing was that one of the four piers that the mill sat on had sunk into the ground over time, added to this was the fact that the mill was in a fixed position, and not facing directly into the prevailing wind at the time.<ref name=Wright/> The mill wreckage was carefully dismantled on [[15 December]] [[2003]]<ref name=BBC2>{{cite web| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/3320755.stm| publisher = BBC News Online| title = Destroyed windmill dismantled| accessdate= 2008-04-15}}</ref> and put into storage while a decision was made on the future of the building. There were rumours that the mill would be rebuilt at the [[Museum of Kent Life]], but on [[31 March]] [[2004]] it was announced that the mill was to be rebuilt on site.<ref name=BBC4>{{cite web| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/3585157.stm| publisher = BBC News Online| title = Destroyed windmill to be rebuilt| accessdate= 2008-04-15}}</ref> The restoration work was carried out by IJP Millwrights, of [[Binfield Heath]], [[Berkshire]]. The work included new crosstrees and quarterbars, a new windshaft, both breast and tail of the mill rebuilt and new weatherboarding all over. Four new sails were made, replacing those which were on the mill at the time of its collapse. These had been fitted in 2001. By early May 2005, work had commenced on site re-erecting the frame of the mill. The reconstructed frame of the mill was erected on the new trestle on [[25 May]] [[2005]].<ref name=Wright>{{cite web| url= http://www.southbarn.plus.com/news.htm| publisher = Southbarn| title = Chillenden Village| accessdate= 2008-04-15}}</ref> The mill reopened to visitors on [[13 September]] [[2005]].<ref name=BBC3>{{cite web| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4241518.stm| publisher = BBC News Online| title = Restored village windmill reopens | accessdate= 2008-04-15}}</ref>

==Description==
{{for|a description of the machinery|Mill machinery}}
''Chillenden windmill'' is a white open trestle post mill with four [[Windmill sail|spring sails]] carried on a [[cast iron]] windshaft. The windshaft carries a cast iron Brake Wheel with a wooden rim.<ref name=Tube>{{cite web| url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e_twojMqws| publisher = You Tube user Anorakman10 (David from Canterbury)| title = Chillenden Windmill| accessdate= 2008-04-15}}</ref> The Brake Wheel has fifty wooden cogs, driving a cast iron Wallower on a cast iron Upright shaft. This carries a cast iron Great Spur Wheel which drives two pairs of underdrift [[millstone]]s in the head of the mill. The mill formerly had a maize kibbler, but this was removed when the mill was restored in 1958. The mill is winded by a tailpole.<ref name=West/>
