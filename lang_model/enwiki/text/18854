'''''The Pledge''''' ([[2001]]) is a dramatic [[psychological]] [[thriller]] [[film director|directed]] by [[Academy Award]]-winner [[Sean Penn]]. It is based on a [[The Pledge|novel of the same name]] by [[Switzerland|Swiss]] author [[Friedrich D<U+00FC>rrenmatt]]. D<U+00FC>rrenmatt wrote the novel along with the screenplay for the [[1958]] film ''[[Es geschah am hellichten Tag]]'' (''It Happened in Broad Daylight'').

==Plot==

{{spoiler}}

Jerry Black is a retired detective, who during his retirement party decides to join one of his colleagues in one last case. The case involves the [[child sexual abuse|molested]] body of an eight-year-old girl, found in the mountains of [[Nevada]]. After breaking the news to the girl's parents, Jerry makes a pledge to the distraught mother that he would find the killer. The chief suspect is a mentally challenged [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] who commits [[suicide]] during an interrogation. Jerry doesn't believe that he is the killer, however, so he begins investigating. He learns that two similar incidents had occurred in the area. Mindful of the pledge he made, he buys an old gas station in the mountains, and searches for a tall man who calls himself the Wizard, using clues from a drawing done by the murdered girl.

He is the only person to suspect that a [[serial killer]] is involved, and his obsession with finding the killer begins to erode his sanity as he strives to keep his promise.

'''Tagline:''' ''Detective Jerry Black has made a promise he can't break, to catch a killer he can't find.''
