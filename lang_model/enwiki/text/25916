'''''Ocean of Sound''''' is a [[compilation album]] compiled and produced by English musician and author [[David Toop]]. The two-disc, [[cross-licensing|cross-licensed]] "[[various artists]]" compilation contains 32 tracks culled from a variety of musical sources, including [[dub (music)|dub]], [[exotica]], [[free jazz]], and [[field recordings]]. Toop compiled the recordings to serve as both a historical survey of [[ambient music]] and an aural companion to his 1995 book ''Ocean of Sound: Aether Talk, Ambient Sound and Imaginary Worlds''.

''Ocean of Sound'' was released in January 1996 by [[Virgin Records]]. It was well received by music critics and finished fourth in the voting for ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s annual [[Pazz & Jop]] critics poll. The album later went [[out of print]].

== Background ==
In 1995, [[David Toop]] published his second book, ''Ocean of Sound: Aether Talk, Ambient Sound and Imaginary Worlds'', which examined music as a medium for deep mental involvement.<ref name="Matos1"/> In the book, Toop said that [[ambient music]] can be defined as music listened for relaxation or music that "taps into the disturbing, chaotic undertow of the environment".<ref>{{cite book|last=Toop|first=David|authorlink=David Toop|year=1995|publisher=[[Serpent's Tail]]|title=Ocean of Sound: Aether Talk, Ambient Sound and Imaginary Worlds|isbn=185242382X|page=36}}</ref> As an aural companion to the book, Toop curated the compilation album ''Ocean of Sound'', which would also serve as a historical survey of ambient music.<ref name="IND">{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=5 January 1996|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4770469.html|title=Various Artists Ocean of Sound Virgin AMBT 10|accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref> The album was released in January 1996 by [[Virgin Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/release/ocean-of-sound-mr0003142193|title=Ocean of Sound <U+2013> David Toop : Release Information, Reviews and Credits|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref> It later went [[out of print]], which music journalist Michaelangelos Matos said was because such cross-licensed compilation albums "seldom stay available for very long".<ref name="Matos1"/>

{{cquote|I was making a point about the immersive quality of 20th century musical experiences. Immersion is the key word for me; not background. The whole idea of background music was a red herring, a distraction <U+2013> there is no such thing as background music, in the sense that so-called background music is always deployed (though not always accepted) as a lifestyle accessory and lifestyle is a collection of strong signifiers.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Perfect Sound Forever (magazine)|Perfect Sound Forever]]|date=August 1997|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/toop.html|last=Gross|first=Jason|title=David Toop interview|accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref>}}

Toop [[programming (music)|programmed]] the recordings for the album so that they would [[segue (music)|segue]] into one another.<ref name="Matos2"/> ''Ocean of Sound'' begins with three songs by Jamaican dub producer [[King Tubby]], American jazz keyboardist [[Herbie Hancock]], and English electronic musician [[Aphex Twin]], respectively, before transitioning to compositions by [[Claude Debussy]], [[John Cage]], [[the Beach Boys]], and [[Peter Br<U+00F6>tzmann]], as well as an audio recording of [[Buddhist monk]]s. Toop programmed [[the Velvet Underground]]'s 1968 song "[[I Heard Her Call My Name]]" so that its muted feedback would segue into an underwater recording of [[bearded seal]]s barking.<ref name="Matos2"/>

In a contemporary review for ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'', music critic [[Peter Shapiro (journalist)|Peter Shapiro]] was impressed by how the album highlights musical similarities among its disparate artists and viewed it as both a manifestation of the book's discussion and "a remarkable collection of great music".<ref name="Shapiro">{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Shapiro (journalist)|page=45|journal=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|location=London|date=February 1996|title=Soundcheck}}</ref> ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote that "Toop navigates smoothly between the various strands that have contributed to the current [[techno]]/'[[Fourth World, Vol. 1: Possible Musics|fourth-world]]' style of ambient-pop", because he used sources such as [[music of Asia|Oriental music]], [[minimalism]], and [[classical music|classical]] composers.<ref name="IND"/> Michaelangelo Matos of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' viewed it as an idyllic compilation whose songs segue fluently because of Toop's aesthetic, but also stand alone as separate pieces that are interesting, if not excellent: "''Ocean of Sound'' is one of those records that have something to teach even the most jaded music fan about how to listen to music."<ref name="Matos2">{{cite news|last=Matos|first=Michaelangelo|date=23 September 1999|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/all-over-the-map/Content?oid=900289|title=All Over the Map|newspaper=[[Chicago Reader]]|accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref> [[AllMusic]]'s John Bush recommended the album to any "wide-ranging ambient fan" and said that it illustrates the ideas in Toop's book "beautifully".<ref name="Bush"/>

''Ocean of Sound'' was voted the fourth best compilation of the year in ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s annual [[Pazz & Jop]] critics poll.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Village Voice|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres96.php|title=The 1996 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll|date=25 February 1997|location=New York|accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]], the poll's creator, named it the best compilation of 1996 in his own list for the Pazz & Jop.<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|date=25 February 1997|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/deans96.php|title=Pazz & Jop 1996: Dean's List|newspaper=The Village Voice|location=New York|accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref> In a retrospective review, he called the album a "gorgeously segued 32-track tour of trad ambient" with recordings that are smaller representations of larger generational concerns such as disorder and anxiety: "For Toop, it answers a need that's both [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] and [[Millennials|millennial]], synthesizing insecurity and hope, 'bliss' and 'non-specific dread.'"<ref name="Christgau"/>
