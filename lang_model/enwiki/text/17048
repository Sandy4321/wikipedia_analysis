'''Henry Bell Gilkeson''' (June 6, 1850 <U+2013> September 29, 1921) was an American [[lawyer]], [[politician]], [[Superintendent (education)|school administrator]], and [[banker]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[West Virginia]]. 

Gilkeson was born in [[Moorefield, West Virginia|Moorefield]], [[Virginia]] (now West Virginia) in 1850, the eldest child of a [[dry goods]] merchant, and was raised in [[Romney, West Virginia|Romney]]. He graduated from [[Hampden<U+2013>Sydney College]]. Following his education, Gilkeson became a schoolteacher and served as superintendent of the [[Hampshire County Schools]] district from 1877 to 1879. Gilkeson subsequently undertook the study of law and started a law practice in Romney. Following the death of [[John Collins Covell]] in 1887, Gilkeson served as the principal of the [[West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind]] until 1888. 

Gilkeson served in the [[West Virginia Legislature]] as a [[state senator]] representing the 12th District in the [[West Virginia Senate]] (1890<U+2013>93) and as a member of the [[West Virginia House of Delegates]] (1883<U+2013>85 and 1909<U+2013>11). Gilkeson also served as the [[Mayoralty in the United States|mayor]] of Romney (beginning in 1885), and the first president of the Bank of Romney (1888<U+2013>1913).

== Academic career ==
Following his graduation from Hampden<U+2013>Sydney College, Gilkeson became a schoolteacher and later served as superintendent of the Hampshire County Schools [[School district|district]] from 1877 to 1879.<ref name = "Fusfeld1"/><ref name = "Maxwell5">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=496.}}</ref><ref name = "Maxwell6">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=279.}}</ref> Before 1886, Gilkeson was elected a member of the Romney Literary Society together with his brother.<ref name = "Maxwell3">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=436.}}</ref>

===West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind===
From 1876 to 1888, Gilkeson served as a member and secretary of the fourth, fifth, and sixth Board of Regents of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind, a position through which he familiarized himself with the school's efforts to educate its [[Deafness|deaf]] and [[Blindness|blind]] students.<ref name = "Maxwell2">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|pp=478<U+2013>479.}}</ref><ref name = "Fusfeld2">{{Harvnb|Fusfeld|1921|p=477.}}</ref>

In 1887, upon the death of the schools' principal, [[John Collins Covell]], Gilkeson was selected by the Board of Regents to serve as principal of the institution.<ref name = "Fusfeld2"/><ref name = "Maxwell7">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=475.}}</ref><ref name = "Maxwell8">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=477.}}</ref> The Board of Regents had reservations about selecting an immediate successor to Covell, and requested that Gilkeson fill the position temporarily until the board could safely carefully a permanent replacement.<ref name = "WVDOE1">{{Harvnb|West Virginia Department of Education|1907|p=92.}}</ref> Gilkeson left his lucrative law practice and accepted the position under the condition that he serve as an interim principal while the Board of Regents sought a more suitable candidate to build upon Covell's initiatives and reforms.<ref name = "Fusfeld2"/><ref name = "Maxwell7"/> Gilkeson believed that only administrators and educators fluent in [[sign language]] should be appointed to serve in the School for the Deaf, and during his tenure as principal, he found that personnel who relied on [[Language interpretation|interpreters]] did not receive "satisfactory results".<ref name = "Fusfeld3">{{Harvnb|Fusfeld|1921|p=478.}}</ref> After a few weeks as acting principal, the Board of Regents reconvened and appointed Gilkeson to stay on as the permanent principal.<ref name = "WVDOE1"/> 

During his tenure, the position of principal included the roles of [[clerk]], [[Bookkeeping|bookkeeper]], [[wikt:steward|steward]], and final arbiter of matters in the classroom.<ref name = "Fusfeld3"/> While he lacked special training for the position, Gilkeson's business experience allowed him to run the schools in an economically efficient manner, which pleased the schools' Board of Regents.<ref name = "Maxwell7"/>

In the summer of 1888, Gilkeson was delegated by the Board to Regents to attend the Conference of Superintendents and Principals of American Schools for the Deaf in [[New York City]] and select the most fitting candidate present or recommended to replace him as principal of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind.<ref name = "Fusfeld2"/> Gilkeson tendered an offer to C. H. Hill, an instructor at the [[Maryland School for the Deaf]], and upon Gilkeson's return to Romney, he recommended Hill and resigned from his post as principal. Hill was subsequently appointed by the Board to fill his position.<ref name = "Fusfeld2"/><ref name = "Maxwell7"/><ref name = "Maxwell8"/> While the Board of Regents was pleased with Gilkeson's performance as principal and wished for him to stay on in the position, he sought to return to his professional law and political career.<ref name = "WVDOE1"/>

Although Gilkeson resumed the practice of law and pursued a political career, he continued his involvement with and advocacy for the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind, especially through his influence as a prominent lawyer and [[State legislature (United States)|state legislator]].<ref name = "Fusfeld2"/> Gilkeson used his position as a state legislator to condemn and hold accountable the officials responsible for the mismanagement of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind, and often interceded on the schools' behalf following Hill's retirement due to political reasons.<ref name = "Fusfeld2"/> Gilkeson was displeased with the state's political interference in the schools, and the "multiplication" of positions within the institution that were filled with personnel who had political or business ties but lacked prior knowledge or experience with deaf and blind education.<ref name = "Fusfeld3"/>

As a criminal lawyer he defended the interests of his clients with all his energy, never however beyond the bounds of honor or of the ethics of his profession. His courtesy to the court, to his associates at the bar, and to witnesses was always such as to place upon him the unerasable stamp of 'gentleman'. His decisions were always based on one proposition &ndash; the right. He was not aggressive. He was unobtrusive in manner, but firm as a rock in his conception of duty. It was a blessed privilege for any young man to have been associated with him and to have been influenced by him as one was bound to be".
