'''''Kedok Ketawa''''' ({{IPA-id|k<U+0259><U+02C8>d<U+0254><U+0294> k<U+0259><U+02C8>tawa|}}; Indonesian for ''The Laughing Mask'', also known by the Dutch title '''''Het Lachende Masker''''') is a 1940 action film from the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now Indonesia). [[Union Films]]' first production, it was directed by Jo An Djan. Starring Basoeki Resobowo, Fatimah, and Oedjang, the film follows a young couple who fight off criminals with the help of a masked man.

Advertised as an "Indonesian cocktail of violent actions&nbsp;... and sweet romance",{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1940, (untitled)}} ''Kedok Ketawa'' received positive reviews, particularly for its [[cinematography]]. Following the success of the film, Union produced  another six works before being shut down in early 1942 during the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupation]]. The film, screened until at least August 1944, may be [[lost film|lost]].

==Plot==
In [[Cibodas]], [[Banten]], a young woman named Minarsih (Fatimah) is rescued from four thugs by the painter Basuki (Basoeki Resobowo). They fall in love and begin planning their life together. However, a rich man interested in taking Minarsih to be his wife sends a gang to kidnap her. Basuki is unable to repel them, but is soon joined by a masked vigilante known only as the "The Laughing Mask" (Oedjang), who has almost supernatural fighting abilities. After two battles with the gang, Basuki and The Laughing Mask are victorious. Basuki and Minarsih can live together in peace.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1940, Kedok Ketawa}}

==Production==

''Kedok Ketawa'' was the first film produced by [[Union Films]],{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=232}} one of four new [[production house]]s established after the success of [[Albert Balink]]'s ''[[Terang Boelan]]'' revived the ailing film industry of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Union was headquartered in Prinsenlaan, Batavia (now Mangga Besar, [[Jakarta]]) and funded by the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]] businessman Ang Hock Liem, although Tjoa Ma Tjoen was in charge of day-to-day operations.{{Sfn|Biran|2009|pp=205, 232<U+2013>33}} The film was shot on-location in Cibodas, and featured fighting, comedy, and singing.<ref>{{harvnb|Pemandangan 1940, (untitled)}}; {{harvnb|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1940, Kedok Ketawa}}</ref>

The film was directed by Jo An Djan and starred Oedjang, Fatimah, and Basoeki Resobowo. Other members of the cast included S Poniman and Eddy Kock.<ref>{{harvnb|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1940, (untitled)}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Kedok Ketawa}}</ref> Oedjang had been a stage actor before appearing in the film, while Fatimah and Basoeki were nobles with a formal education.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Biran|2009|p=244}} writes that Fatimah was "educated" (''terpelajar'') without specifying the extent of her studies. Basoeki had graduated from an Algemeene Middelbare School, the equivalent of a senior high school.}} The Indonesian film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] writes that this is evidence the film was targeted at intellectual audiences, a manifestation of Union's stated goal of "improv[ing] the quality of Indonesian art".{{efn|Original: "''...&nbsp;buat mengangkat derajatnya kesenian Indonesia.''"}}{{Sfn|Biran|2009|pp=232<U+2013>33, 244}}

Following the success of ''Terang Boelan'' (1937; based on ''[[The Jungle Princess]]''), the domestic film industry began to model their productions after [[Hollywood]] works, as this was expected to ensure financial success. The Indonesian film scholars Ekky Imanjaya and Said Salim write that ''Kedok Ketawa'' was influenced by [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]'' through its Hollywood adaptations. Neither writer gives comparisons to illustrate this influence.<ref>{{harvnb|Imanjaya|2006|p=38}}; {{harvnb|Said|1992|p=102}} </ref>

''Kedok Ketawa'' was not the first contemporary film featuring a masked hero. [[Tan's Film]] had released ''[[Gagak Item]]'' (''The Black Crow''), with [[Rd Mochtar]] as the masked Black Crow, in 1939,{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=175<U+2013>76}} and later productions, including Java Industrial Film's ''[[Srigala Item]]'' (''The Black Wolf''; 1941), continued the trend.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=274}} As was common for contemporary productions, the soundtrack for ''Kedok Ketawa''&nbsp;<U+2013> performed by Poniman&nbsp;<U+2013> consisted of ''[[kroncong]]'' songs.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=232}}

==Release and reception==
''Kedok Ketawa'' was released in Batavia in July 1940,{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=232}} with a press screening on 20 July.{{sfn|Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad 1940, Filmaankondiging Cinema Palace}} By September it was being shown in [[Surabaya]].{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1940, (untitled)}} In some newspaper advertisements, such as in ''Pemandangan'', it was referred to as ''Pendekar dari Preanger'' (''Warrior from Preanger''),{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Kedok Ketawa}} while in others it was advertised with the Dutch title ''Het Lachende Masker''.{{efn|This title also meant "The Laughing Mask".}}{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1940, (untitled)}} It was marketed as an "Indonesian cocktail of violent actions&nbsp;...&nbsp;and sweet romance"{{efn|Original: "''...&nbsp;een indonesische cocktail van heftige acties&nbsp;... zoete romantiek"}} and rated for all ages.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1940, (untitled)}}

The critic and screenwriter [[Saeroen]], writing for ''Pemandangan'', praised ''Kedok Ketawa'', especially its cinematography and the beauty of its scenery; he compared the film to imported Hollywood films.{{sfn|Saeoren 1940, (untitled)}} An anonymous review in ''[[Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad]]'' found that the film was a mix of [[native Indonesians|native]] and European sensibilities and lauded its cinematography. According to the review, the film surpassed expectations, but it was evident that this was a first production.{{sfn|Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad 1940, Filmaankondiging Cinema Palace}} Another review, in ''[[Soerabaijasch Handelsblad]]'', considered the film among the best local productions, emphasising the quality of its cinematography and acting.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1940, Kedok Ketawa}}

==Legacy==
Soon after the success of ''Kedok Ketawa'', Saeroen joined Union Films and wrote four films for the company. These were not directed by Jo An Djan, who left Union for the competitor Populair's Film, but by the newly hired R Hu and [[Rd Ariffien]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=233}} Union Film ultimately produced a total of seven films in 1940 and 1941 before being closed following the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese invasion]] in early 1942.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=233}} Of the film's main cast, only Fatimah and Oedjang are recorded as continuing their acting career, both appearing in several further Union productions.<ref>{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Basuki Resobowo}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Eddy Kock}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Oedjang}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, RS Fatimah}}</ref> However, in the 1950s Resobowo continued his career behind the screen, serving as art director of such films as ''[[Darah dan Doa]]'' (''The Long March''; 1950).{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Basuki Resobowo}}

''Kedok Ketawa'' was screened as late as August 1944,{{sfn|Tjahaja 1944, (untitled)}} but may now be [[lost film|lost]]. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable [[nitrate film]], and after a fire destroyed much of [[Produksi Film Negara]]'s warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed.{{sfn|Biran|2012|p=291}} While the American visual anthropologist [[Karl G. Heider]] suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost,{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=14}} J.B. Kristanto's ''Katalog Film Indonesia'' records several as having survived at [[Sinematek Indonesia]]'s archives, and Biran writes that some Japanese propaganda films have survived at the [[Netherlands Government Information Service]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=351}}
