'''''Black Christmas''''' is a {{fy|1974}} [[Cinema of Canada|Canadian]] [[horror film]], directed by [[Bob Clark]], which has a very large [[cult following]]. It was written by A. Roy Moore, and based largely on a series of real-life murders in [[Montreal, Quebec]], around [[Christmas]] time.  ''Black Christmas'' stars [[Olivia Hussey]] as a young college student who must deal with a deranged killer lurking in her [[sorority house]]. Taking only 40 days to shoot, it also features [[Margot Kidder]] and [[Andrea Martin]], before either had gained fame in the United States, [[John Saxon (actor)|John Saxon]] and [[Keir Dullea]] round out the cast. The film's score is by Carl Zittrer. 

==Plot==
{{Cleanup|section|date=December 2009}}
An unknown man walks towards a [[sorority house]] during a [[Christmas]] party and climbs up and through an open [[attic]] window. Sorority girls Jess Bradford, Barb Coard, and Phyllis Carlson are inside. The prowler heads outside of the attic into the house and creeps through upstairs. The girls get a phone call from someone they call "The Moaner". The call starts out sexual in nature, but it grows more [[macabre]], with the man on the other end saying strange things in different voices. The shyest sorority girl, Clare Harrison, goes upstairs to pack up; as she does she hears something in her closet. Going in to investigate, the Killer dives out and wraps a [[plastic bag]] around her [[head]], [[asphyxiating]] her. The sorority girls downstairs give their present to Mrs. Mac, the house mother. With all of the commotion no one hears Clare screaming. Later that night, Jess knocks on Clare's door, and nobody answers. The now-dead Clare is seen in the attic on a rocking chair with the plastic bag wrapped around her head, while the Killer is singing.

The next day, Clare's father arrives to pick her up, but she isn't there. Nobody has seen her since the night before. Jess talks to her boyfriend Peter. Jess is pregnant and they discuss whether or not they should become parents. Peter suggests they get married, but Jess tells him she doesn't want to marry him, or have the baby. Jess, at the house, gets another obscene phone call from the Killer. The sorority girls are at the [[police]] station to report that Clare is nowhere to be found. Peter, obviously distraught from his earlier conversation with Jess, thinks he fails at playing an important piano recital before judges. Later he is shown in the room smashing the piano.

Back at the house, Mrs. MacHenry gets ready to leave, but hears the cat Claude meowing from somewhere in the attic. Mrs. Mac peers into the attic and sees Clare dead and the Killer holding a crane hook directly in front of her. The hook hits her in the face, killing her, and pulls her up into the attic. The sorority girls, still outside, help look for Clare and end up finding the body of a murdered high school girl instead. Jess, returning to the house, gets another obscene phone call from the Killer. After the call, she meets Peter who wants to talk to her about the baby. She tells him she has decided to get an [[abortion]]. Peter begins to behave strangely and becomes emotionally distraught. A police officer is outside keeping an eye on the house, and Peter stays outside behind a tree looking at the house.

Barb, having drunk far too much, heads to bed and the Killer leaves the attic. As Jess listens to carolers outside, the Killer grabs a glass unicorn and stabs Barb repeatedly, with her screams being drowned out by the carolers' singing. Later, Phyllis checks on Barb and, as she enters the room, the killer closes the door and murders her.

Jess gets another obscene phone call. After that, the police call her and tell her that the calls are coming from the inside of the house and to get out. She arms herself with a fireplace poker and goes upstairs to get Barb and Phyllis. Upstairs she opens the door to Barb's room and sees their dead bodies. She sees the Killer's eye behind the door, slams it against him and runs to the front door of the house which is stuck. She gets chased by the Killer with a notable shot of the Killer grabbing Jess' hair. She manages to escape and hides in the basement. She then sees Peter who breaks through the basement window. Jess now believes that Peter is the killer. He slowly approaches, asking if she is okay while she grips the fireplace poker. Outside, the police arrive and hear a loud scream. When they enter the basement, Jess is seen alive and stunned with a bloodied Peter laying against her. Jess has killed Peter with the fireplace poker. 

Jess is sedated and left in a bed upstairs. The police, confident the Killer was Peter, leave the house as Clare's father faints from the enormity of the situation (and the fact that Clare has still not been found). As Jess sleeps alone, the camera pans slowly down the hall and upstairs to the [[trapdoor]] of the attic, where we see it open slightly. Inside the attic, the two bodies of Mrs. Mac and Clare remain undiscovered. We discover the Killer is still alive, and is not Peter, and says "Agnes, it's me, [[Billy (Black Christmas)|Billy]]." There is an abrupt cut to the outside of the house, where a lone police officer stands guard on the front porch. The camera pans back and we see Clare, whose face is covered in plastic, sitting in a rocking chair right in front of the attic window. The sound of the trapdoor opening and footsteps down the attic ladder are heard. As the credits roll, the phone begins to ring insinuating that one final murder has taken place as the Killer only calls after he has killed.

==Production==
===Filming===
Working from a budget of $620,000 and an 8-week shooting schedule, the film was shot in 35mm format utilizing Panavision cameras and lenses in and around [[Toronto]] during the winter of 1974. [[Annesley Hall|Annesley Hall National Historic Site]] was used for some scenes. 

Director Bob Clark has stated that the original script for the film featured more graphic murder scenes. Clark and writer Roy Moore agreed that the film would be more effective with less gore.

Due to surprisingly light snowfall, the snow seen outside of the sorority house was actually made from a foam material that was provided by the local fire department. Shooting the search party scenes in the park proved to be quite difficult, as the temperature was well below freezing that night.

[[Keir Dullea]] worked only for a week on this film, never meeting [[Margot Kidder]] and barely meeting [[John Saxon (actor)|John Saxon]], but the film is edited in such a way that he appears to be present throughout.

According to director [[Bob Clark]], about five people were responsible for voicing the frightening phone calls, including Clark, actor Nick Mancuso and an unnamed actress. The audio for the demented phones calls was edited into the film during post-production. While shooting the footage for the phone call scenes, the actresses were actually reacting to threatening dialog being spoken from Clark from off-camera.

Actress [[Lynne Griffin]] revealed that, for the scenes where she's wrapped in the plastic bag, she would rip a hole in the bag, stuffing the opening into her open mouth so she could breathe during filming. Clark stated in a Q&A session that no shots of Griffin in the plastic bag were filmed for longer than one minute.

[[Bob Clark|Clark]] stated in an interview that he couldn't recall whose eye was used for that infamous shock scene where Jess sees "Billy" staring at her from behind the door.

===Direction===
Cameraman Albert J. Dunk created Billy's POV shots by rigging up a camera harness that would mount the camera on his shoulder as he walked around in the house. Dunk climbed the trellis and the attic ladder himself.

Upon preparation in 1975 for its [[United States of America|U.S.]] release, Warner Bros. studio executives asked [[Bob Clark]] to change the ending. The proposed idea was to have the cops leaving Jess alone with Chris, Clare's boyfriend. Jess wakes up and Chris says, "Agnes, don't tell them what we did," before killing her. However, Clark refused, insisting that the ending be ambiguous.

===Music===
Composer Carl Zittrer said in an interview that he created the bizarre music score for the film by tying forks, combs, and knives to the strings of his piano so the sound would warp as he struck the keys. Zittrer also said he would distort the sound further by recording audio tape while putting pressure on the reels of the machine to make it turn slower.

===Title===
The original title of the films script was ''Stop Me''. It was director Clark who came up with the title ''Black Christmas'', saying that he liked the irony of something dark occurring during such a festive holiday. When originally released in the United States, [[Warner Bros.]], fearing that audiences might confuse it for a [[blaxploitation]] movie, changed the title to ''Silent Night, Evil Night''. It performed poorly until its title was changed back to ''Black Christmas''. The film was later retitled ''Stranger in the House'' for television broadcast. 

==Release==

===International releases===
The [[United Kingdom|British]] cinema version was cut by the [[BBFC]] to remove all instances of the word 'cunt' from the obscene phone calls, along with some of the other crude sexual references during the same initial phone call scene.

===Critical reaction===
Critics' reviews were mixed; for example, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' felt the film was heavily clich<U+00E9>d and that "''Black Christmas'', a bloody, senseless kill-for-kicks feature, exploits unnecessary violence in a university sorority house operated by an implausibly alcoholic ex-hoofer. Its slow-paced, murky tale involves an obscene telephone caller who apparently delights in killing the girls off one by one, even the hapless house-mother."<ref>[http://www2.variety.com/ref.asp?u=IMDB&p=H2BE&sid=VE1117789312] - Review in ''Variety'' magazine, 1974.</ref> The film has a 64% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1002484-black_christmas/</ref>

===Network television broadcast===
When [[NBC]] showed the film (as ''Stranger in the House'') during prime time, it was deemed "too scary" for network television and was pulled off the air.

===Cult status===
The film gained a fairly decent [[cult following]] over the years after its original release. After popularization stemming from the Black Christmas website - Itsmebilly.com and word of mouth, increasing [[home video]] availability, ''Black Christmas'' is now considered by some fans to be the inventor of the modern slasher movie and receives high praise by much of the horror community. The Terror Trap website cites it among their 10 greatest horror pictures ever. The film is at #87 on Bravo's [[100 Scariest Movie Moments]].
