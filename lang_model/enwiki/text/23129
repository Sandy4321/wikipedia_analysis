Wingspan has a voracious appetite for new data to absorb and analyze, and by extension, is incredibly nosey. Forever poking his beak where it does not belong, his natural hunger for information serves him well as a data processor for the Decepticons, even if he is just as likely to snoop through someone<U+2019>s window as he is to spy on the latest Autobot meeting.

Wingspan transforms into a hawk, and possesses incredibly visual acuity, all the better to perform his function with. In addition to this ability, he is also equipped with a collection of chemical and infrared sensors for collecting and analyzing geographical data to help him locate natural resources for the Decepticons. In robot mode, he wields twin electro-burst rifles.

===Animated series===
The Decepticon Clones only appeared in the U.S. ''Transformers'' animated series in "The Rebirth, Part One", the first episode of the show's fourth and final season. When the Decepticon forces attacked [[Autobot City]] in 2007, Pounce and Wingspan were assigned a special task <U+2013> under cover of the diversionary assault, the clones were to break into the city's vault and steal the key to the legendary [[Plasma Energy Chamber]]. When the Autobot double-agent [[Punch/Counterpunch|Punch]] spotted them blasting their way into the city, he attempted to discern their mission by assuming his Decepticon guise of Counterpunch, but when they rebuffed his aid, he resumed his Autobot form and attacked. Pounce countered, blocking Punch while Wingspan opened the vault, transforming to hawk mode and seizing the key before escaping aboard [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]].

Although the characters' voices noticeably fluctuate from line to line, officially, [[Stan Jones (actor)|Stan Jones]] provided the voice of Pounce, while [[Peter Cullen]] portrayed Wingspan.

Pounce and Wingspan were also featured in the Japanese-exclusive ''Transformers: Headmasters'' animated series. Formerly friends with the [[Autobot Clone]]s, when the two groups went their separate ways to travel and enhance their skills, Pounce and Wingspan came under the wing of [[Galvatron]] and joined the Decepticon forces. The Autobot Clones, meanwhile, had discovered a map that lead to a hidden source of proton energy, and the Decepticon clones attacked their former friends, stealing half of it. Heading to the "Pirate Planet" on which the energy was hidden, they were ambushed by the Autobots Clones upon arriving, but with help from [[Sixshot]], they defeated them and claimed the other half of the map. Within the pyramid that the map uncovered, the two sets of clones faced off, and the Autobot Clones claimed victory, forcing Pounce and Wingspan to retreat. The proton energy, however, was revealed to have been depleted long ago.

Pounce and Wingspan subsequently accompanied [[Scorponok]]'s forces to Planet Master, but returned to Earth ahead of them. Following orders sent by Scorponok as he headed back to the planet, the two launched an energy-absorbing satellite from a site in [[Athens]], then rendezvoused with Sixshot, unaware of the fact that he had been betrayed by Scorponok and planned to derail his scheme. Inadvertently revealing to Sixshot the information he needed, the clones were attacked by the ninja and severely damaged, but managed to survive the assault, helping in the final steps of Scorponok's plan and participating in the massive battle at the [[North Pole]].

Note: In some English dubs of the ''Headmasters'' series the clones were simply called "The Wingspan" and not given individual names. 

===IDW Publishing===
Pounce made a brief appearance in the ''[[The Transformers: Spotlight|Spotlight]]'' issue on [[Sixshot]], as one of the Decepticons manning the consoles as Sixshot enters the control room in the Decepticon base. <ref>http://www.tfrebellion.com/reviewspotlight4.htm</ref>
