It made its radio debut on [[9 July]] [[2007]] on Australian radio stations,<ref name=news.com>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,22041297-7642,00.html|title=Powderfinger go back to school|publisher=[[News.com.au]]|work=[[The Courier Mail]]|accessdate=2007-07-09|date=[[8 July]] [[2007]]}}</ref> and was subsequently released as a [[single (music)|single]] and [[digital download]] on [[4 August]] [[2007]] in Australia,<ref name=JB>{{cite web|url=http://www.jbhifionline.com.au/music/id/1070102|title=I Don't Remember - Powderfinger|work=JB Hi Fi|accessdate=2007-10-31}}</ref> [[3 September]] [[2007]] in [[New Zealand]],<ref name=digirama>{{cite web|url=http://www.digirama.co.nz/musicvideodetails.aspx?Mediaid=680917|title=I Don't Remember|publisher=digirama.co.nz|accessdate=2008-01-15|date=[[2007-08-04]]}}</ref> and [[13 August]] [[2007]] in the [[United States]].<ref name=USARelease>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/powderfinger/2017660/album.jhtml|title=Powderfinger <U+2014> I Don't Remember|work=[[VH1]]|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>

The song was written by Powderfinger [[lead singer]] [[Bernard Fanning]], and influenced by [[bassist]] [[John Collins (musician)|John Collins]].<ref name=making1 /> The [[riff]] was then developed by [[guitarist]] [[Ian Haug]].<ref name=making2 /> The song is about reconciling difficulties and arguments, rather than shifting the blame.<ref name=wombat />

"I Don't Remember" was lauded by some reviewers, who appreciated its energy, while other reviewers were more critical, dubbing it an "[[advertisement]] song".  The music video also received critical acclaim, especially for the parodies it contained.  Despite the reviews, "I Don't Remember" charted poorly, only reaching #42 on the [[ARIA Singles Chart]].<ref name=ARIAsingles>{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Powderfinger&titel=I+Don't+Remember&cat=s|title=Powderfinger I Don't Remember|publisher=Australian-charts.com|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>

==Background, writing, and recording==
The song was written by Powderfinger's [[lead singer]], Bernard Fanning, following a night he spent drinking with [[bassist]] [[John Collins (musician)|John Collins]] towards the end of the recording phase of ''[[Dream Days at the Hotel Existence]]''.<ref name=making1>{{cite video|url=http://music.ninemsn.com.au/mediapopup.aspx?mediaID=106497&Playlist=16&Fmode=0|format=[[Windows Media Audio|WMV]]|title=The making of 'I Don't Remember' part 1|accessdate=2007-10-31|publisher=[[NineMSN]]}}</ref> The song was written by Fanning on guitar, but he later wrote the main [[riff]] on piano,<ref name=making1 /> which was then converted into a lead guitar riff performed by [[Ian Haug]].<ref name=making2>{{cite video|url=http://music.ninemsn.com.au/mediapopup.aspx?mediaID=106497&Playlist=17&Fmode=0|format=[[Windows Media Audio|WMV]]|title=The making of 'I Don't Remember' part 2|accessdate=2007-10-31|publisher=[[NineMSN]]}}</ref> The guitars for the song are all tuned down one [[Key signature|step]]; while the guitar finger positioning is played as though in the key of [[C major]], the detuning brings the key of the song down to Bb, with the song leading off with Bb's relative minor, G minor.<ref name=making2 /> During the recording phase, Fanning suggested "softening" the main riff by returning it to the piano, and even recorded this concept; however this piano version did not end up in the final album mix, nor was it included as a B-side on the single.<ref name=making3>{{cite video|url=http://music.ninemsn.com.au/mediapopup.aspx?mediaID=106497&Playlist=18&Fmode=0|format=[[Windows Media Audio|WMV]]|title=The making of 'I Don't Remember' part 3|accessdate=2007-10-31|publisher=[[NineMSN]]}}</ref>

"I Don't Remember" was recorded in [[Los Angeles]] during pre-production for ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence''.<ref name=wombat>{{cite web|url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/music/powderfinger-silverchair-touring-news-2007.htm |title=Powderfinger & Silverchair Tour News|publisher=Web Wombat|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref> It contains a simple [[Acoustic_guitar|acoustic]] [[riff]], similar to several songs on previous albums including ''[[Vulture Street]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,23663,21824790-5007184,00.html|title=Review - Dream Days At The Hotel Existence|publisher=[[news.com.au]]|author=Kathy McCabe|accessdate=2007-10-05}}</ref> While recording the song in January 2007, Fanning said in an interview that:
{{bquote|It's a song about making mistakes and trying to reconcile what they were <U+2014> but then in the end, in the wash up <U+2014> it doesn't really matter whose fault it was, as long as it gets reconciled.<ref name=wombat />}}

This meaning was also evident in the song's lyrics.  In the second line, Fanning states that "I made a mistake that I'll never surpass", before explaining that it does not matter whose fault it is, in saying "I know you needed someone to take the fall/I know you needed someone to blame it on".  In the second verse, Fanning again reiterates that he feels pain in the mistake that was made, when he says "I found my heart and it broke like glass/I made that mistake that I'll never surpass".<ref name=liner>{{cite album-notes |title=Dream Days at the Hotel Existence |albumlink=Dream Days at the Hotel Existence |bandname=[[Powderfinger]] |year=2007 |url=http://www.powderfinger.com/site.php?lyrics&track=i_don't_remember |pages=p. 1 |format= CD booklet |publisher=[[Universal Music Australia]] |publisherid=1735252 |mbid=716302b5-10db-452f-89b1-07814328a8fa }}</ref>

John Collins said of the song:
{{bquote|I hope the song sounds exciting, without sounding... big rock? Without sounding country, and sound interesting, 'cause I think that the basis of the song if you play it on the acoustic is there, and it's up to us [Powderfinger] to stuff it up now.<ref name=making4>{{cite video |url=http://music.ninemsn.com.au/mediapopup.aspx?mediaID=106497&Playlist=19&Fmode=0|format=[[Windows Media Audio|WMV]]|title=The making of 'I Don't Remember' part 4|accessdate=2007-10-31|publisher=[[NineMSN]]}}</ref>}}

When Powderfinger first played the song to [[Benmont Tench]], who would feature in a piano role throughout the album, he remarked that it reminded him of [[Buffalo Springfield]], who was an inspiration of [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]]. Fanning replied that "we were thinking more of the Heartbreakers", indicating the musical style intended in "I Don't Remember", but also paying homage to Tench, whom the band would work with extensively.<ref>Mengel, Noel ([[7 July]] [[2007]]). "Powderfinger's distinctive sound given a sparkling setting". ''[[The Courier Mail]]'', p. 52.</ref> Tench performed with the band on the album version of the song.<ref name=liner />

==Music video==
The music video for "I Don't Remember" was made by Fifty Fifty Films, who had previously collaborated with the band on the videos for "[[Like a Dog]]", "[[(Baby I've Got You) On My Mind]]", and "[[Lost and Running]]", all nominated for [[ARIA Awards]].<ref name=news.com /><ref name="arias-list">{{cite web|url=http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history-by-artist.php?letter=P&artist=Powderfinger|title=History: Winners by Artist: Powderfinger|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]|accessdate=2008-01-16}}</ref>

The music video starts on a school bus with children playing and throwing things, and features a young boy who then selects the track "I Don't Remember" on his iPod and closes his eyes. He then dreams about a school concert for a band called "Littlefinger", a parody of the band for which he is the lead singer "Bernie", a parody of [[Bernard Fanning]]. The band and audience is comprised of primary school students. Children are seen offering a chocolate milk called smilo, a take on [[Milo]], and a camera crew for "Channel [Z]" and reporter "Su-Mi". This is a parody of [[Yumi Stynes]], a presenter from Australian music station [[Channel V]]. The end of the clip shows that it was a dream being had by the student who played the lead singer for "Littlefinger".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsunhit.com.au/product/i_dont_remember_1568711_11722.html |title=I Don't Remember (Powderfinger)|publisher=[[Herald Sun|Herald Sun HiT]]|accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref>

Many elements of "I Don't Remember"'s video received positive critical response, often for the usage of children in it. Kathy McCabe of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' summarised critical feelings towards the video, by suggesting in her review that "[maybe] bands should get kids to play them in videos forever".<ref>McCabe, Kathy ([[2 August]] [[2007]]). "Music reviews - I Don't Remember - Powderfinger". ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', p. 50.</ref>

In his review of ''[[Dream Days at the Hotel Existence]]'', ''[[Herald Sun|Herald Sun HiT]]'' journalist Cameron Adams claimed that "I Don't Remember" was more of an [[advertisement]] style song, similar to "[[Lost and Running]]", the first single released.  Adams stated that "'I Don't Remember' is not the next single without reason<U+2014>it does everything you expect a Powderfinger single to, perhaps a more appropriate "ad" for this album."<ref name="CAdams">{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsunhit.com.au/product/dream_days_at_the_hotel_existence_1489161_11722.html |title=Dream Days at the Hotel Existence (Standard edition)|publisher=[[Herald Sun|Herald Sun HiT]]|author=Adams, Cameron|accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref> Sputnikmusic contributor James Bishop described "I Don't Remember" as unoriginal, but at the same time said that it proved Powderfinger "haven<U+2019>t forgotten how to write a good song".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=18446|title=Powderfinger Dream Days At The Hotel Existence|publisher=Sputnikmusic|author=James Bishop|date=[[13 October]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref>

[[All Music Guide]] reviewer Clayton Bolger, however, enjoyed the song, describing it as a "stadium anthem" and stating that it was a good example of the "trademarks of classic Powderfinger" showcased on the album. The review labeled the song a "pick".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wc02.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:gnfrxz95ldfe |title=(((Dream Days at the Hotel Existence > Overview)))|publisher=[[All Music Guide]]|author=Bolger, Clayton|accessdate=2008-01-12}}</ref> Web Wombat's review of the album also treated the song positively, dubbing it "classic Powderfinger."<ref name=wombat />  Maxalbums's review agreed with Web Wombat, declaring that "I Don't Remember" "has more classic PF sound", and calling it a catchier song then other works on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maxalbums.com/albums_review_Powderfinger.asp|title=Powderfinger Discography|work=Max Albums|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>  Reviewer Andrew Tijs from CitySearch Brisbane states that the song is "a smoothly emotive jangle-rock tune with a purposeful chorus and Fanning's inimitable vocal", though provides mixed reviews when compared with other songs by the group, stating that "It's no eerie ballad like "[[The Day You Come]]", nor does it have "[[Like a Dog]]"'s snarl, nor "[[(Baby I've Got You) On My Mind|On My Mind]]"'s pub rock shudder."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brisbane.citysearch.com.au/music/viewContent/1119945819575/1137522134364|title=Powderfinger: I Don't Remember|work=Music|publisher=Citysearch.com.au - Brisbane|author=Tijs, Andrew|date=[[2007-08-11]]|accessdate=2008-01-10}}</ref>

"I Don't Remember" was performed regularly on the [[Across the Great Divide Tour]], generally with positive responses.  FasterLouder reviewer gumbuoy stated that "The new songs are excellent live; I Don't Remember has more energy than its <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[sic|''sic'']]<nowiki>]</nowiki> recorded counterpart (Lost and Running)", following by praising the album and performance as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/reviews/events/10349/Powderfinger-Silverchair-Blue-King-Brown-Brisbane-Entertainment-Centre-310807.htm |title=Powderfinger, Silverchair, Blue King Brown @ Brisbane Entertainment Centre, 31/08/07|publisher=FasterLouder|author=gumbouy|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>
