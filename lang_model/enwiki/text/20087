The '''Battle of Cobleskill''' (also known as the '''Cobleskill massacre''') was an [[American Revolutionary War]] raid on the frontier settlement of [[Cobleskill (village), New York|Cobleskill, New York]] on May 30, 1778.  The battle marked the beginning of a phase in which [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]]s and [[Iroquois]], encouraged and supplied by British authorities in [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]], raided and destroyed numerous villages on what was then the United States western frontier of [[New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]].

A small party of Iroquois entered Cobleskill and drew the local defenders into a trap set by a much larger party of Iroquois and Loyalists under the command of [[Joseph Brant]].  After killing a number of the militia and driving off the remainder, Brant's forces destroyed much of the settlement.  New York authorities retaliated against Brant's actions by destroying Iroquois villages later in the year, and [[Continental Army]] forces destroyed more Iroquois villages in [[Sullivan Expedition|a major 1779 expedition]].

==Background==
{{main|Northern theater of the American Revolutionary War after Saratoga}}
With the failure of British General [[John Burgoyne]]'s [[Saratoga campaign|campaign to the Hudson]] after the [[Battles of Saratoga]] in October 1777, the [[American Revolutionary War]] in upstate [[New York]] became a frontier war.<ref>Graymont, pp. 155<U+2013>156</ref>  British leaders in the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] supported [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] and Native American partisan fighters with supplies and armaments.<ref>Kelsay, p. 212</ref>  During the winter of 1777<U+2013>78 Brant and other British-allied Indians developed plans to attack frontier settlements in [[New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Graymont, p. 160</ref>  In February 1778 Brant established a base of operations at [[Onaquaga]] (present-day [[Windsor (village), New York|Windsor, New York]]).  He recruited a mix of Iroquois and white Loyalists estimated to number between two and three hundred by the time he began his campaign in May.<ref>Barr, p. 150</ref><ref>Kelsay, p. 216</ref><ref name=G165>Graymont, p. 165</ref>  One of his objectives was to acquire provisions for his forces and those of [[John Butler (pioneer)|John Butler]], who was planning operations in the [[Susquehanna River]] valley.<ref>Halsey, p. 207</ref>

In 1778 the settlement of [[Cobleskill (village), New York|Cobleskill, New York]] consisted of twenty families living in farms spread out along [[Cobleskill Creek]].  It was part of the [[Schoharie Creek]] area which was a significant source of food for the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] war effort.<ref>''Proceedings of the New York Historical Society'', pp. 35, 37</ref>  Its principal defense was the small local militia under Captain Christian Brown.  When attacks by the Iroquois were rumored to be coming in the spring of 1778, they appealed for additional defenses.  [[Continental Army]] Colonel [[Ichabod Alden]] sent a company of thirty to forty men from his [[7th Massachusetts Regiment]] under Captain William Patrick to reinforce the militia.<ref>Hart, p. 3:132</ref><ref name=PNYHS_37>''Proceedings of the New York Historical Society'', p. 37</ref>

==Battle==
[[Image:Joseph Brant by Charles Willson Peale 1797.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Joseph Brant]], portrait by [[Charles Willson Peale]]]]
On the morning of May 30 Brant laid a trap for Cobleskill's defenders.  He sent forward a small number of natives as a lure.  Captain Patrick's force and the local militia spotted them near the southern edge of the settlement.  Despite Captain Brown's warning that the Indians might be setting a trap, Patrick pressed forward as the natives withdrew, engaging them in a running battle.  After about one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) Brant sprung his trap, and Patrick's company was engulfed by Brant's larger force.  Both Patrick and his second in command were killed in the battle, as was about half of their force.  Brown organized the remaining forces into a fighting retreat back into the settlement.<ref name=G165/>  Five men took refuge in the house of George Warner, which the attackers set on fire, killing all five men.<ref name=G166/>  A total of 22 settlers were killed, eight were wounded, and five captured by Brant's men,<ref>Barr, p. 151</ref> while Brant's force suffered an estimated 25 casualties.<ref>Allen, p. 255</ref>

==Aftermath==
Brant and his men burned ten houses and their outbuildings before withdrawing, killing any cattle he could not take.  Brant took five prisoners, to whom he offered two choices: to be dispersed among Indian families, or to be sent to [[Fort Niagara]] as prisoners of war.  The captives chose the latter.<ref name=G166>Graymont, p. 166</ref>  Brant continued to build his forces and raid frontier communities in the Mohawk valley.<ref>Graymont, pp. 166<U+2013>167</ref>  He considered following up the attack on Cobleskill with one on Cherry Valley, but because the militia was on high alert, he instead withdrew back to Iroquois territory.<ref>Mintz, p. 51</ref>  Cherry Valley was the scene of [[Cherry Valley massacre|a massacre]] the following November by forces led in part by Brant.<ref>Halsey, p. 240</ref>

New York Governor [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]], who had been considering operations against Onaquaga, enlarged those plans after the raid on Cobleskill and Brant's [[attack on German Flatts (1778)|attack on German Flatts]] in September.  In October 1778 militia forces [[Raid on Unadilla and Onaquaga|destroyed]] Onaquaga and [[Unadilla (village), New York|Unadilla]], another Indian village that supported Brant and Butler.<ref>Halsey, pp. 229<U+2013>234</ref>

The settlers of Cobleskill who were rendered destitute by the action received <U+00A3>200 in compensation for their troubles.<ref name=PNYHS_37/>  Settlers from many area communities began withdrawing to larger, better fortified communities like Cherry Valley (which began construction of a fort after the raid) and [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]].  This action and later ones by Brant and Butler contributed to the decision by the [[Continental Congress]] to authorize a major Continental Army expedition into Iroquois territory.<ref>Graymont, p. 167</ref>  Commanded by Generals [[John Sullivan]] and [[James Clinton]], the [[Sullivan Expedition|1779 expedition]] systematically destroyed the villages of Iroquois tribes fighting for the British, but did little to stop the frontier war.<ref>Graymont, pp. 194<U+2013>223</ref>
