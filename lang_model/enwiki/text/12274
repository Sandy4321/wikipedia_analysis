'''''Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962''''' is a [[double album]] featuring live performances by [[The Beatles]], recorded in late December 1962 at the [[Star-Club]] during their final [[Hamburg]] residency. The album was released in 1977 in two different versions, comprising a total of 30 songs by The Beatles. 

The performances were recorded on a home tape machine using a single microphone, resulting in a low fidelity recording. Ted "Kingsize" Taylor began to investigate possible marketing of the tapes in 1973. The tapes were eventually bought by Paul Murphy and subjected to extensive audio processing to improve the sound, leading to the 1977 album.

Although the poor sound quality limits its commercial appeal, the album provides historic insight into the group's club act in the period after [[Ringo Starr]] joined but before the emergence of [[Beatlemania in the United Kingdom|Beatlemania]]. The Beatles were unsuccessful in legally blocking the initial release of the album; the recordings were reissued in many forms until 1998, when The Beatles were awarded full rights to the performances.

==History==
===Background===
{{further|[[The Beatles in Hamburg]]}}
The Beatles' five residencies in Hamburg during 1960 to 1962 allowed the [[Liverpool]] band to develop their performance skills and widen their reputation. Drummer [[Pete Best]] was added to the band in August 1960 to secure their first Hamburg booking, where they played for 48 nights at the Indra Club and then 58 nights at the [[Kaiserkeller]]. The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961 to play at the [[Top Ten Club]] for three months.<ref>Lewisohn (2000), pp. 22, 28, 42.</ref>

A new Hamburg music venue, the Star-Club, opened on 13 April 1962, with The Beatles booked for the first seven weeks. The Beatles returned to Hamburg in November and December 1962 for their fourth and fifth engagements there, which had been booked for the Star-Club many months in advance. Unlike their previous three trips to Hamburg, their drummer was Starr, having replaced Best in August. The Beatles were reluctant to return for their final two-week booking, which started 18 December, as they were gaining popularity in Britain and had just achieved their first charted single with "[[Love Me Do]]".<ref>Lewisohn (2000), pp. 62, 69, 86.</ref>

===Recording===
Portions of The Beatles' final Star-Club performances (along with other acts) were recorded by the club's [[stage management|stage manager]], Adrian Barber, for Ted "Kingsize" Taylor.<ref name="Williams209">Williams (1975), p. 209.</ref> Barber used a [[Grundig]] home [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel recorder]] at a [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording#Tape speeds|tape speed]] of 3<U+00BE> inches per second, with a single microphone placed in front of the stage.<ref name="Traiman">{{cite news |last=Traiman |first=Stephen |title=Reconstruct Old Beatles Tape |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |page=8 |date=11 December 1976 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BiUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT7 |accessdate=21 June 2009}}</ref> Taylor, leader of The Dominoes (who were also playing at the club), said that [[John Lennon]] verbally agreed to the group being recorded in exchange for Taylor providing the beer during their performances.<ref name="Williams209"/>

The tapes were originally described as having been recorded in the spring of 1962, an attempt to pre-date The Beatles' June 1962 contract signing with [[Parlophone]].<ref name="Unterberger38">Unterberger (2006), p. 38.</ref> However, song arrangements and dialogue from the tapes pointed to late December 1962,<ref name="Unterberger39">Unterberger (2006), p. 39.</ref> and a recording date of 31 December 1962 (the group's last day in Hamburg) was commonly cited.<ref>Lewisohn (2000), p. 86.</ref> Later researchers have proposed that the tapes are from multiple days during the last week of December,<ref>Unterberger (2006), pp. 38-39.</ref> which is consistent with original Beatles manager [[Allan Williams]]' description that a total of about three hours was recorded over three or four sessions between Christmas and New Year's Day.<ref name="Williams209"/>

{{Sound sample box align right|Music sample:}}{{Listen|filename=Beatles Hamburg Mr Moonlight.ogg|title="Mr. Moonlight"|description=Sample of the Star-Club performance of "Mr. Moonlight", with Lennon's altered lyric |format=[[Ogg]]|filename2=Beatles Hamburg Roll Over Beethoven.ogg|title2="Roll Over Beethoven"|description2=Sample of the "breakneck pace" performance of "Roll Over Beethoven" at the Star-Club |format2=[[Ogg]]}}{{sample box end}}</div>

The tapes captured The Beatles performing at least 33 different titles, plus some repeated songs.<ref name="Unterberger40">Unterberger (2006), p. 40.</ref> Of the 30 songs that were commercially released from the tapes, only two were [[Lennon/McCartney]] compositions. The others were an assortment of [[cover version]]s, seventeen of which would be re-made by The Beatles and appear on their various studio albums or ''[[Live at the BBC (The Beatles album)|Live at the BBC]]''.<ref name="Unterberger39"/> The arrangements played at the Star-Club are similar to the versions recorded later, albeit less refined, although there are a few cases with distinct differences. For example, "Mr. Moonlight" has a much quicker tempo, a guitar-based instrumental break, and an intentionally altered lyric with Lennon proclaiming he is on his "nose" instead of his "knees"; "Roll Over Beethoven" was described as "never taken at a more breakneck pace".<ref name="Unterberger39"/>

The recording equipment and method resulted in the tapes being unmistakably [[low fidelity]]. The vocals, even in the best cases, sound "somewhat muffled and distant".<ref name="Unterberger39"/> The vocals on a few songs are so indistinct that labeling and [[liner notes]] on early releases gave incorrect information about who was singing and the exact song being performed. Much of The Beatles' dialogue between songs is audible, which includes addressing the audience in both English and German, as well as repartee among themselves. The banter is irreverent and coarse at times, an aspect of their stage act that would soon cease under the influence  of manager [[Brian Epstein]].<ref  name="Unterberger40"/>

===Marketing attempts===
Taylor said he had offered to sell the tapes to Epstein in the mid 1960s, but that Epstein did not consider them to be of commercial value and offered only <U+00A3>20. Taylor said he kept the tapes at home, largely forgotten until 1973 when he decided to look into their marketability.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vintage Beatles tape may go on market |agency=AP |work=[[Ocala Star-Banner]] |date=12 December 1976 |page=8A |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Vi4TAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nQUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6971,2581785 |accessdate=18 June 2009}}</ref> Williams relates a different history than Taylor, stating that after Taylor returned to [[Liverpool]], he left the tapes with a [[recording engineer]] for editing into a potential album. The project was never finished and the engineer later relocated, with the tapes being among many items left behind. In 1972, Williams, Taylor, and the engineer gained access to the abandoned office and recovered the tapes "from beneath a pile of rubble on the floor."<ref name="williamsp209-210">Williams (1975), pp. 209-210.</ref> 

When the existence of the tapes was first publicly reported in July 1973, Williams was planning to ask [[Apple Corps|Apple]] for at least <U+00A3>100,000.<ref>Badman (2003), pp. 108-109.</ref> Williams said he later met with [[George Harrison]] and Starr to offer the tapes for <U+00A3>5000, but they declined, citing financial difficulties at the time.<ref name="williamsp210-212">Williams (1975), pp. 210-212.</ref> Williams and Taylor teamed up with Paul Murphy, head of Buk Records, to find an outlet for the tapes.<ref name="White">{{cite news |last=White |first=Chris |title=See Way Clear For 'New' Beatles LPs |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |page=54 |date=25 December 1976 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xCQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT147 |accessdate=21 June 2009}}</ref>

===Release===
Murphy eventually bought the tapes himself and formed a new company, [[Lingasong Records|Lingasong]], specifically for the project.<ref name="White"/> He sold the worldwide distribution rights to Double H Licensing, which spent more than $100,000 on elaborate audio processing and mixing of the songs under the direction of Larry Grossberg.<ref name="Traiman"/> The sequence of songs was rearranged, and some of the individual songs were edited in order to bypass flawed tape sections or make up for an incomplete recording.<ref name="Unterberger39"/>

After an unsuccessful attempt by The Beatles to block it, the 26-song ''Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962'' was released by Lingasong.<ref name="Unterberger38"/> The album first appeared in Germany in April 1977 in association with [[Bellaphon Records]], and was released in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] the following month.<ref name="weinerp61"/> For the album's June 1977 US release (in association with [[Atlantic Records]]), four songs were removed and replaced with four different songs from the tapes.<ref name="weinerp138,159">Weiner (1992), pp. 138, 159.</ref>

===Reissues===
Over the next two decades, the recordings were licensed to several record companies, resulting in numerous releases with varying track selections. In 1979, [[Pickwick Records]] performed some additional audio filtering and [[equalization]] of the songs on the Lingasong US version, and released it over two volumes as ''[[First Live Recordings]]''; the set included the song "[[Hully Gully (song)|Hully Gully]]" that was mistakenly credited to The Beatles,<ref name="weinerp139">Weiner (1992), p. 139.</ref> but was actually performed by [[Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers]], another act on the Star-Club bill.<ref>Winn (2008), p. 23.</ref> In 1981, Audio Fidelity Enterprises released ''Historic Sessions'' in the UK, the first single package with all thirty Beatles tracks from the original Star-Club releases.<ref name="weinerp163">Weiner (1992), p. 163.</ref> Several additional songs from the Star-Club tapes have appeared on [[The Beatles bootleg recordings|Beatles bootleg]] records over the years.<ref name="Unterberger40"/>

The release of the recordings on two [[compact disc|CD]]s by industry giant [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]] in 1991 sparked renewed legal attention by The Beatles (as represented by [[Paul McCartney]], Harrison, Starr, and [[Yoko Ono]]).<ref>{{cite news |title=Prime cuts? |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=11 September 1992 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,311771,00.html |accessdate=19 June 2009}}</ref> Sony also produced a version specifically for their Columbia House music club, but Sony withdrew the titles in 1992 as a lawsuit was progressing. Lingasong's CD release of the original set prompted another Beatles lawsuit in 1996; the case was decided in 1998 in favour of The Beatles, who were granted ownership of the tapes and exclusive rights to their use. Harrison appeared in person to provide evidence in the case, and his testimony was cited as an important factor in the judge's decision. Harrison characterized the claim that Lennon gave Taylor permission for the recording as "a load of rubbish", and added: "One drunken person recording another bunch of drunks does not constitute business deals."<ref>{{cite news |last=Lister |first=David |title=Beatles win historic ban on bootleg CD |work=[[The Independent]] |date=9 May 1998 |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/beatles-win-historic-ban-on-bootleg-cd-1160811.html |accessdate=17 June 2009}}</ref>

==Reception==
The album had limited commercial success, reaching a peak position of 111 during a 7-week run on the US [[Billboard 200]] album chart.<ref>{{cite book | last=Whitburn | first=Joel | authorlink=Joel Whitburn | title=Top Pop Albums: 1955-1996 | publisher=Record Research | date=1996 | page=66}}</ref> Assessments of the album often weigh the poor sound quality against the historic importance and insight provided into The Beatles' early stage act.
