The '''Adriatic Sea''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02CC>|e<U+026A>|d|r|i|<U+02C8>|<U+00E6>|t|<U+0268>|k}}) is a body of water separating the [[Apennine Peninsula]] from the [[Balkan peninsula]], and the [[Apennine Mountains]] from that of the [[Dinaric Alps]] and adjacent ranges.  The Adriatic Sea is the northernmost arm of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] extending from the [[Strait of Otranto]], where it connects to the [[Ionian Sea]], to the Northwest and the [[Po Valley]]. Its coasts belong to [[Italy]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Albania]]. The Adriatic contains more than a [[List of islands in the Adriatic|thousand islands]], largely located along its Eastern coast. The Adriatic is divided into three basins&mdash;the Northern being the shallowest and the Southern being the deepest, where the maximum depth of {{convert|1233|m|abbr=off}} is recorded. Otranto Sill is located at the border of the Adriatic and Ionian seas. Prevailing currents flow in counterclockwise direction from the Strait of Otranto, along the Eastern coast and back to the strait along the Western, Italian coast. Tidal movement is slight, although [[acqua alta|larger amplitudes]] are known to occur occasionally. Salinity of the Adriatic is lower compared to the Mediterranean as the former collects a third of freshwater flowing into the latter, acting as a [[dilution basin]]. Surface water temperature generally ranges from {{convert|24|C|F}} in summer to {{convert|12|C|F}} in winter, significantly moderating climate of the Adriatic basin. Shores of the Adriatic are populated by more than 3.5&nbsp;million people, and the largest cities are [[Bari]], [[Venice]], [[Trieste]] and [[Split, Croatia|Split]].

The Adriatic Sea sits on [[Apulian Plate|Apulian or Adriatic Microplate]] which separated from the [[African Plate]] in [[Mesozoic]]. Movement of the plate contributed to [[Alpine orogeny]] and uplift of the Apennines. All types of sediment are found in the Adriatic, with bulk of the material transported by the [[Po (river)|Po]] and other rivers on the West coast. The Western coast is [[Flat coast|alluvial]] or [[Marine terrace|terraced]], while the Eastern coast is well indented with pronounced [[karst|karstification]]. There are 15 [[marine protected area]]s in the Adriatic designed to protect the karst [[habitat]]s and [[biodiversity]] of the sea. The sea is abundant in flora and fauna&mdash;more than 7,000 species are identified as native to the Adriatic, including [[Endemism|endemic]], rare and threatened ones.

The earliest settlements on the Adriatic shores were [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], [[Illyria]]n, and [[Classical Greece|Greek]]. By the 2nd century BC, the shores were under full control of the [[Roman Republic|Rome]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], the Adriatic shores and the sea itself was controlled, to a varying extent, by a series of states&mdash;most notably the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Napoleonic Wars]] resulted in [[First French Empire|French]] control of the coasts and [[Adriatic campaign of 1807<U+2013>1814|British effort]] to counter the French in the area, ultimately securing most of the Eastern Adriatic and the Po Valley for [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]. Following [[Italian unification|unification]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Italy]] started eastward expansion which would last until the 20th century. Following the [[World War I]] and collapse of [[Austria-Hungary]] and the Ottoman Empire, control of the Eastern coast passed to [[Yugoslavia]] and Albania. The former [[breakup of Yugoslavia|disintegrated]] in 1990s, resulting in four new states on the Adriatic shores. 

The Adriatic Sea is significant for economies of the countries found along its coasts, especially in terms of [[Fishery|fisheries]] and tourism. The [[NUTS of Croatia|Adriatic Croatia]] recently records comparably greater growth relative to the rest of the Adriatic basin. Maritime transport is also a significant branch of economy in the area&mdash;there are 19 major seaports in the Adriatic handling more than a million tonnes of cargo per year. The largest Adriatic seaport by annual cargo turnover is the [[Port of Trieste]], while the [[Port of Split]] is the largest Adriatic seaport in terms of number of passengers served per year. Italy and former Yugoslavia defined their maritime boundaries by 1975 and the boundary is recognized by Yugoslavia's successor states, but maritime boundaries between Slovene, Croatian, Bosnia and Herzegovinian and Montenegrin waters are disputed. Italy and Albania defined their maritime boundary in 1992.

The Adriatic Sea contains well more than a thousand [[List of islands in the Adriatic|islands and islets]].

===Bathymetry===
North Adriatic basin, extending between Venice and [[Trieste]] towards a line connecting [[Ancona]] and [[Zadar]], is only {{convert|15|m|abbr=off}} deep at its northwestern end, and it gradually deepens towards the southeast. Middle Adriatic basin extends south of the Ancona&ndash;Zadar line, as {{convert|270|m|adj=on}} deep Middle Adriatic Pit (also called Pomo Depression or Jabuka Pit).
{{convert|170|m|adj=on}} deep Palagru<U+017E>a Sill is south of the Middle Adriatic Pit, separating it from {{convert|1200|m|adj=on}} deep South Adriatic Pit and the Middle Adriatic basin from the South Adriatic Basin. Further on to the south, the sea floor rises to {{convert|780|m|abbr=off}} to form Otranto Sill at the boundary to the Ionian Sea. Transversally, the Adriatic Sea is also asymmetric as the [[Apennine peninsula]] coast is relatively smooth with very few islands and [[promontory]] of [[Monte Conero]] and [[Gargano Promontory]] as only significant protrusions into the sea. On the other hand, the Balkan peninsula coast is rugged with numerous islands, especially in Croatia. Ruggedness of the coast is exacerbated by proximity of the [[Dinaric Alps]] to the coast, in contrast to the opposite, Italian coast, where the [[Apennine Mountains]] are further away from the shoreline.<ref name="CRGP-p2-6">Cushman-Roisin, Ga<U+010D>i<U+0107>, Poulain; pp. 2&ndash;6</ref> Average depth of the Adriatic sea is {{convert|252|m|abbr=off}}, while its maximum depth is {{convert|1233|m|abbr=off}}. Still, the North Adriatic basin rarely exceeds depth of {{convert|100|m|abbr=off}}.<ref name="BTS-Adriatic"/>

===Hydrology===
[[File:Adriatic jadran.png|thumb|left|Currents and salinity on cross-sections of the East (A) and the West (B) Adriatic]]
Dynamics of coastal waters are determined by the asymmetric coasts and inflow of Mediterranean seawater through the Straits of Otranto and further on along the Eastern coast.<ref name="Adriamed"/> The smooth Italian coast, comprising very few protrusions into the sea and no major islands allows smooth flow of the Western Adriatic Current, while coastal currents on the opposite shore are far more complex because of jagged appearance of the shoreline, several large islands and proximity of the Dinaric Alps to the shore. The latter produces significant temperature variations between the sea and hinterland, which is conductive surrounding to creation of local jets.<ref name="CRGP-p2-6"/> Tidal movement is slight, normally remaining below {{convert|30|cm|abbr=off}}. The [[amphidromic point]] is at mid-width east of Ancona.<ref name="CRGP-p218">Cushman-Roisin, Ga<U+010D>i<U+0107>, Poulain; p. 218</ref>

The normal tide levels are known to increase abnormally in conductive environment, leading to coastal flooding, most famously known in Italy, especially Venice, as [[acqua alta]]. They can exceed normal tide levels by more than {{convert|140|cm|abbr=off}}, with the highest tide level of {{convert|194|cm|abbr=off}} observed on 4 November 1966. Such flooding is caused by a combination of factors, including alignment of the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]], geometric shape of the basin, which amplifies or reduces the astronomical component and meteorological factors such as atmospheric pressure and winds. Also, the long and narrow rectangular shape of the Adriatic Sea is the source of an oscillating water motion&mdash;[[seiche]] along the basin's minor axis<ref>Introduction to ''Previsioni di Marea nell'Alto Adriatico'' (in Italian), Venice, issue 29 of year 29, by Stefano Fracon</ref> Finally, Venice is increasingly vulnerable to flooding because of [[subsidence]] of coastal area soil.<ref name="Centro_Maree">{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.venezia.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/3045|language=Italian|title=Venice Municipality - Tide Monitoring and Forecast Center - Weather and sea parameters and their statistics}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8428781.stm|title=Flood waters drench city of Venice|date=23 December 2009|accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref> Such floods were also observed elsewhere in the Adriatic Sea, and have been recorded in recent years in [[Koper]], Zadar and [[<U+0160>ibenik]] as well.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Nova TV (Croatia)]]|language=Croatian|url=http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/svijet/u-zasnijezenoj-sloveniji-raste-vodostaj-rijeka-more-poplavilo-obalu.html|title=U Sloveniji more poplavilo obalu|trans_title=Sea floods shore in Slovenia|date=9 November 2010|accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Nova TV (Croatia)]]|language=Croatian|title=Zadar: Zbog velike plime more poplavilo obalu|trans_title=Zadar: Sea floods shore because of high tide|url=http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/zadar-zbog-plime-more-poplavilo-rivu.html|date=25 December 2009|accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=index.hr|language=Croatian|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/jugo-i-niski-tlak-more-poplavilo-sibensku-rivu/526311.aspx|title=Jugo i niski tlak: More poplavilo <U+0161>ibensku rivu|Sirocco and low pressure: Sea floods <U+0160>ibenik quay|date=1 December 2010|accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref>

It is estimated that the entire volume of the Adriatic Sea is exchanged through the Strait of Otranto in 3.4<U+00B1>0.4&nbsp;years, which is a comparably short period. For instance, approximatey 500&nbsp;years are necessary to exchange all water of the [[Black Sea]]. This is particularly important as rivers flowing into the Adriatic [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] up to {{convert|5700|m3/s|abbr=off}}. That rate of discharge amounts to 0.5% of total Adriatic Sea volume or a {{convert|1.3|m|adj=on}} layer of water each year.

===Temperature and salinity===
Surface temperature of the Adriatic sea largely ranges from {{convert|22|to|24|C|F}} in summer, or {{convert|12|to|14|C|F}} in winter, except along the northern part of the western Adriatic coast, where the surface temperature drop to {{convert|9|C|F}}.

===Climate===
As in most of the areas in the [[Mediterranean Basin]], the Adriatic Sea and its surrounding landmass enjoy [[Mediterranean climate]], a particular variety of [[subtropical climate]]. Since the Adriatic Sea is located at [[mid-latitudes]], it is characterized by seasonal variability of climate. The climate is characterized by warm to hot, dry summers and mild to cool, wet winters. Air temperature fluctuates by about {{convert|20|C|F}} during a season.<ref name="Artegiani"/> According to the [[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]], the southern and central Adriatic are classified as hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa), and the northern Adriatic as [[Humid subtropical climate]] (Cfa) climate areas.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[University of Salento]]|format=PDF|url=http://www.dsm.unisalento.it/webutenti/piero.lionello/public/book/mb_0_PL/chapter0_V6.pdf|title=Mediterranean climate: Background information|accessdate=27 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|publisher=[[University of Zadar]]|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/9626|author1=Tomislav <U+0160>egota|author2=Anita Filip<U+010D>i<U+0107>|language=Croatian|pages=17-37|title=K<U+00F6>ppenova podjela klima i hrvatsko nazivlje|trans_title=K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification and Croatian terminology|journal=Geoadria|volume=8|issue=1|year=2003|month=June|accessdate=27 January 2012}}</ref> Predominant winter winds are [[Bora (wind)|bora]] and [[sirocco]] (''jugo'').

[[Venice]], which was originally built on islands off the coast, is most at risk due to [[subsidence]], but the effect is realized in the Po delta as well. The causes are a decrease in the sedimentation rate due to loss of sediment behind dams and the deliberate excavation of sand for industrial purposes agricultural use of water, and removal of ground water.<ref name=WW>{{cite web|title=Facing Water Challenges in the Po River Basin, Italy:A WWDR3 Case Study|url=http://waterwiki.net/index.php/Facing_Water_Challenges_in_the_Po_River_Basin,_Italy:A_WWDR3_Case_Study|publisher=waterwiki.net|year=2009|accessdate=6 April 2009}}</ref><ref name=AM>{{cite web|title=Po Basin Case study status report|first=Meri|last=Raggi|coauthors=Davide Ronchi; Laura Sardonini;  Davide Viaggi|publisher=AquaMoney|year=2007|format=pdf|accessdate=6 April 2009|url=http://www.aquamoney.ecologic-events.de/sites/download/poit.pdf}}</ref>

===Coasts===
The Eastern Adriatic coast, especially between [[Gulf of Trieste]] and [[Bay of Kotor]], is one of the most indented ones. The majority of the eastern coast is characterized by [[karst]] topography, developed from the Adriatic Carbonate Platform. Karstification there largely began after final uplift of the Dinarides in Oligocene and [[Miocene]], when the carbonate deposits were exposed to atmospheric effects, extending to level of {{convert|120|m|abbr=off}} below present sea level, exposed during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. It is estimated that some karst formations are related to earlier emersions, most notably the [[Messinian salinity crisis]].<ref name="Suri<U+0107>"/> Similarly, karst developed in [[Apulia]] from the Apulian Carbonate Platform.<ref>{{cite journal|format=PDF|url=http://carsologica.zrc-sazu.si/downloads/401/Parise.pdf|journal=Acta Carsologica|volume=40|issue=1|pages=73-93|year=2011|author=Mario Parise|title=Surface and subsurface karst geomorphology in the Murge (Apulia, Southern Italy)|accessdate=28 January 2012|issn=0583-6050|publisher=[[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]}}</ref>

There are alternations of maritime and alluvial sediments occurring in Po Valley, at the Northwest coast of the Adriatic, as far west as [[Piacenza]], dating to [[Pleistocene]] as the sea advanced and receded over the valley.

==Flora and fauna==
The Adriatic Sea is unique unit of the Mediterranean in terms of [[biogeography]], particularly because of numerous [[Endemism|endemic]] species. Croatian National Biodiversity Strategy Action Plan identified more than 7,000 animal and plant species in the Adriatic Sea. The Middle Adriatic basin is especially abundant in endemic plant species, with 535 identified species of [[Green algae|green]], [[Brown algae|brown]] and [[red algae]].<ref name="USAID-Bio">{{cite web|publisher=Natural Resources Management & Development Portal|url=http://rmportal.net/library/content/118_croatia/view?searchterm=en|title=Biodiversity assessment for Croatia|date=31 December 2000|author=Chemonics International Inc.|accessdate=31 January 2012}}</ref> Four out of five Mediterranean [[seagrass]] species are found in the Adriatic Sea. The most common species are [[Cymodocea nodosa]] and [[Zostera|Zostera noltii]], while [[Zostera marina]] and [[Posidonia oceanica]] are comparably rare.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Aquatic Botany]]|volume=77|year=2003|pages=17-25|title=Genome size of Adriatic seagrasses|authors=Jasna Dolenc Koce, Barbara Vilhar, Borut Bohanec, Marina Dermastia|accessdate=30 January 2012|url=http://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/57225.pdf|format=PDF|issn=0304-3770}}</ref>

A number of [[Rare species|rare]] and [[threatened species]] are also found along the eastern coast of the Adriatic, and as it is relatively clearer and less polluted compared to the Western Adriatic coast&mdash;in part because the sea currents flow through the Adriatic in counterclockwise direction, thus bringing clearer waters up the Eastern coast and returning as increasingly polluted water down the Western coast. This has significantly contributed to the biodiversity of the countries along the eastern Adriatic coast. The [[common bottlenose dolphin]] is common in the Eastern coast waters only. Approximately thirty species of fish are found only in one or two of the countries bordering Adriatic Sea. Those are particularly related to the karst morphology of the coastal or submarine topography. There are 45 [[subspecies]] endemic to the Adriatic Sea coast and islands. In the Adriatic Sea, there are at least 410 species and subspecies of fish, representing approximately 70% of Mediterranean taxa, with seven species endemic to the Adriatic. 64 species are considered threatened, largely because of overfishing.<ref name="USAID-Bio"/> Only a small fraction of the fish fauna found in the Adriatic is attributed to recent processes such as [[Lessepsian migration]], cases of escape from [[mariculture]] and similar.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Magnolia Press|url=http://books.google.hr/books/about/Checklist_of_the_Adriatic_Sea_Fishes.html?id=agwskgAACAAJ|title=Checklist of the Adriatic Sea Fishes|author1=Lovrenc Lipej|author2=Jakov Dul<U+010D>i<U+0107>|isbn=9781869775759|year=2010|accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref>

==Boundaries==
[[File:TrattatoDiOsimo.jpg|thumb|right|Signing ceremony of the Treaty of Osimo, 10 November 1975]]
Italy and Yugoslavia defined their delimitation of the continental shelf in the Adriatic Sea in 1968,<ref>{{cite book|pages=11-13|url=http://books.google.hr/books?id=lLVFW0an7NUC|title=The maritime boundaries of the Adriatic Sea|authors=Gerald Henry Blake, Du<U+0161>ko Topalovi<U+0107>, Clive H. Schofield|publisher=IBRU|year=1996|isbn=9781897643228|accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref> with an additional agreement on the boundary in the Gulf of Trieste signed in 1975 pursuant to the Treaty of Osimo. The boundary agreed in 1968 extends {{convert|353|nmi|abbr=off}} and consists of 43&nbsp;points connected by straight lines or circular arc segments. The boundary agreed upon in 1975 consists of 5&nbsp;points, extending from an end point of the 1968 line. All successor states of the former Yugoslavia accepted the agreements. In the southernmost areas of the Adriatic the border was not determined in order to avoid prejudicing location of [[tripoint]] with the Albanian continental shelf border, which remains undefined. Prior to breakup of Yugoslavia, Albania, Italy and Yugoslavia initially proclaimed {{convert|15|nmi|adj=on}} [[territorial waters]], subsequently reduced to {{convert|12|nmi|abbr=off}} and all sides adopted [[Baseline (sea)|baseline]] systems. Most of these were introduced in 1970s. Albania and Italy determined their border at the sea in 1992 on [[equidistance principle]].<ref name="Geoadria-Borders">{{cite journal|journal=Geoadria|publisher=[[University of Zadar]]|issn=1331-2294|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=71443|title=The maritime boundaries of the Adriatic Sea|author1=Mladen Klemen<U+010D>i<U+0107>|author2=Du<U+0161>ko Topalovi<U+0107>|pages=311-324|volume=14|issue=2|month=December|year=2009|accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref> Following [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|accession of Croatia to the EU]], the Adriatic is expected to become an internal sea of the EU.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Nacional (weekly)]]|url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/40630/zerp-je-nepotrebna-avantura|language=Croatian|title=ZERP je nepotrebna avantura|trans_title=ZERP is a needless adventure|author=Robert Bajru<U+0161>i|date=6 December 2007|accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref>

===Disputes===
Unlike land borders of former Yugoslav republics and subsequently the successor states, their maritime borders were not defined. In addition, the maritime boundary between Albania and Montenegro was not defined before the 1990s. Croatia and Slovenia started negotiations in 1992 but failed to agree resulting in [[Croatia<U+2013>Slovenia border disputes|a dispute]] which was referred to arbitration in 2009. Croatia also declared [[Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone]] (ZERP) extending to the continental shelf boundary, but its application to the [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]] was suspended pending definition of the borders. In 2005, Slovenia also declared its protected ecological and continental shelf zone encompassing parts of the Croatia's ZERP. Still the dispute causes no major practical problems in reality. Maritime boundary between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia was formally settled in 1999, but few issues remained in dispute&mdash;[[Klek, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Klek peninsula]] and two islets in the border area. Croatia&ndash;Montenegro maritime boundary is disputed in the Bay of Kotor, at the [[Prevlaka]] peninsula, exacerbated by occupation of the peninsula by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] and later by [[Military of Serbia and Montenegro|FR Yugoslav Army]], ultimately replaced by an [[United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka|United Nations observer mission]]. The observers left in 2002 and Croatia took over the area as an agreement allowing Montenegrin presence in Croatian waters in the bay was made. The dispute proved far less contentious since independence of Montenegro.<ref name="Geoadria-Borders"/>

==Economy==
===Fishing===
The Adriatic Sea [[Fishery|fisheries]] production varies among countries in the basin. In 2000, nominal total landings of all Adriatic fisheries reached 110&nbsp;thoushand tonnes.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=FAO AdriaMed|url=http://www.faoadriamed.org/pdf/publications/td13/mmm-td-13.pdf|format=PDF|title=Adriatic Sea Fisheries: outline of some main facts|authors=Piero Mannini, Fabio Massa, Nicoletta Milone|accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref> The largest volume of the fisheries production is achieved in Italy, where the total production volume in 2003 stood at 472&nbsp;thousand tonnes for human consumption and 15&nbsp;thousand tonnes for other purposes. 28.8% of that volume are landings in the Northern and central Adriatic, and 24.5% in Apulia&mdash;Southern Adriatic and Ionian Sea. Italian fisheries, including those operating in outside the Adriatic, employ 60,700 in the [[Primary sector of the economy|primary sector]], including [[aquaculture]] which comprises 40% of the total fisheries production. Gross value of the total fisheries output in 2002 was 1.9&nbsp;billion [[United States dollar|US$]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]|url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/countrysector/FI-CP_IT/en|title=Fishery and Aquaculture Country Profiles - Italy|accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref>

In 2006, total Croatian fisheries production volume was 37.8&nbsp;thousand tonnes of catch and 14.2&nbsp;thousand tonnes in marine aquaculture. Croatian fisheries, employ approximately 20,000. Marine capture catch in 2006 in Croatian waters consisted of [[sardine]]s (44.8%), [[anchovy|anchovies]] (31.3%), [[tuna]]s (2.7%), other [[pelagic fish]] (4.8%), [[hake]] (2.4%), [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]] (2.1%), other [[demersal fish]] (8.3%), [[crustacean]]s (largely [[lobster]] and [[Nephrops norvegicus]]) (0.8%), [[shellfish]] (largely [[oyster]]s and [[mussel]]s) (0.3%), [[cuttlefish]] (0.6%), [[squid]]s (0.2%) and [[octopus]]es and other [[cephalopod]]s (1.6%). Croatian marine aquaculture production consists of tuna (47.2%), oysters and mussels (28.2% combined) and [[Bass (fish)|bass]] and [[bream]] (24.6% combined).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/FI/DOCUMENT/fcp/en/FI_CP_HR.pdf|format=PDF|title=Fishery Country Profiles - Croatia|accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref>

In 2006, Albanian fisheries production amounted to 7,699&nbsp;tonnes, including 1,970&nbsp;tonnes of aquaculture production. At the same time, Slovenian fisheries produced a total of 2,500&nbsp;tonnes with 55% of the production volume originating in aquaculture, representing the highest ratio in the Adriatic. Finally, Montenegrin fisheries production stood at 911&nbsp;tonnes in 2006, with all but 11&nbsp;tonnes coming from capture production.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=FAO AdriaMed|url=http://www.faoadriamed.org/html/country_p/AllCProfile.html|title=Country Fishery Information|accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref>

===Oil and gas===
[[Natural gas]] is produced through several projects, including a joint venture started by [[Eni]] and [[INA (company)|INA]] companies which operates two platforms&mdash;one of them is in Croatian waters and draws gas from six wells, and the other one, which started operating in 2010, is located in Italian waters. The Adriatic gas fields were discovered in the 1970s, but their development commenced in 1996.
