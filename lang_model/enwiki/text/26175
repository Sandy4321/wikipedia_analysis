'''Abraham of Smolensk''' was a [[monk]] of [[Smolensk]], his birthplace, where he became a monk of the Bogoroditzkaja monastery. He is historically regarded as a miracle worker. As a monk, he engaged in extensive preaching and biblical study. He is considered to be a notable figure in pre-[[Mongol]] [[Russia]]. 

He is described as being a man of stern and militant character, who kept the idea of the [[Last Judgement]] in the minds of himself and others. He was very popular among the [[laity]], as he worked for the sick and troubled. He was less popular with the other local clergy, who came to view him with enmity and jealousy. 

This animosity led ultimately to several moral and theological charges being brought against him. Based on these charges, the local bishop of Smolensk took disciplinary measures against Abraham, which cast a cloud over his character for five years. He was said to have been later justified by a miracle. At that time, the bishop reopened the case against Abraham, acquitted him against the charges leveled against him, and made him the [[abbot]] of the smaller Holy Cross monastery in the area. Abraham would spend the rest of his life peacefully following his calling there, dying there peacefully in 1221. A biography by his disciple Ephraem has survived.

==Veneration==
His [[feast day]] is celebrated on August 21 in all of the Russian church.
