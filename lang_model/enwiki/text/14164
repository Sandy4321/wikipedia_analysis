'''Hurricane Baker''' was a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|major hurricane]] that affected the Leeward Islands, Greater Antilles, and the Gulf Coast of the United States. The [[tropical cyclone]] was the second intense hurricane, second hurricane, and second tropical storm of the 1950 Atlantic hurricane season. Hurricane Baker attained peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) near the Leeward Islands, traversed Antigua, and weakened to a [[tropical cyclone scales|tropical depression]] southwest of Puerto Rico. It re-intensified south of Cuba, strengthened to a strong Category 2 hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, and hit the [[United States]] near [[Gulf Shores, Alabama]] with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). Impacts from Hurricane Baker were minimal in the Lesser Antilles and United States.

On the morning of August 20, a strong tropical storm developed 446 miles (718 km) east of [[Basse-Terre]], [[Guadeloupe]].<ref name="BestTrack">{{cite web|author=Atlantic hurricane research division|year=2008|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/tracks1851to2007-apr08.txt|title=Atlantic hurricane best track (1851<U+2013>2007)|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2008-10-24}}</ref> The tropical storm deepened to hurricane intensity. On August 21, it rapidly attained maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h), equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane.
