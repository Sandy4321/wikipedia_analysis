==Early years==
[[Image:AngelMendez1.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Cpl.. Angel Mendez (1966)]]
Angel Mendez' parents &mdash; Antonio Mendez Pomales, a native of [[Fajardo]] and Martina Rivera Garcia from [[Naguabo, Puerto Rico]] &mdash; moved from [[Puerto Rico]] to [[New York City]] seeking a better life.  His father owned and attended a grocery store in the [[South Bronx]] while his mother cared for their eight children at home. When Mendez' mother became ill and the family's economic situation worsened, his father could not raise him and his siblings, therefore 2 were sent to foster homes and 6 were placed in the Mission of the Immaculate Virgin, an orphanage on Mount Loretto, [[Staten Island]].<ref name=Mission>The Mission of the Immaculate Virgin was founded in 1871 by Father John Christopher Drumgoole, and is the largest childcare institution in the United States. See [http://www.miv-mountloretto.org/aboutus.html The History of the Mission of the Immaculate Virgin at Mount Loretto].</ref> There he received his primary and secondary education. Mendez was a member of the cadet corps along with his brothers and many of the "Mount" kids. At a young age ,he became fascinated with military life and with his friends would often imagine that he was on a "patrol" while camping at Stokes State Forest and Worthington State Forest. <ref name="AM">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-12-20

In 1964, he was among the young men during the Vietnam War era who volunteered to join the Marine Corps right after graduating from high school. Mendez received his [[United States Marine Corps Boot Camp|basic training]] at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island]], [[South Carolina]]. After he graduated from his recruit training, he was sent to [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune]], [[North Carolina]] to attend the [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|School of Infantry]]. Mendez was assigned to Delta Company, [[26th Marine Regiment (United States)|1st Battalion, 26th Marine Regiment]], [[1st Marine Division]].

==Vietnam War==
===Operation DeSoto===
Operation DeSoto, initiated in late December 1966, was the last major battle for Marine units in the [[Quang Ngai|Quang Ngai Providence]] of Vietnam. The 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines was part of the [[Special Landing Force]] (SLF) and took part in operations throughout the Marines Corps area of responsibility and saw extensive action throughout the 4 month long operation. The 7th Marines, with elements of the 5th Marine Regiment, bore the brunt of most of the patrolling and contact with the enemy, whose presence continued in [[Chu Lai]].<ref>[http://www.marzone.com/7thMarines/Hst0002.htm Operation DeSoto]</ref>

Upon his deployment to Vietnam, Mendez was assigned to Company F, [[2nd Battalion 7th Marines|2nd Battalion, 7th Marines]], [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]]. On [[March 16]], [[1967]], Mendez was conducting a [[Search and destroy]] mission with his company when they came under attack from a [[Viet Cong]] battalion. Half of his platoon was pinned down in a rice paddy under enemy fire, and Mendez volunteered to lead a squad to assist the pinned-down Marines in returning to friendly lines with their two dead and two seriously wounded men. Mendez exposed himself while returning fire with his [[M79 grenade launcher]] on the enemy.<ref name=M-79> The M-79 [[grenade launcher]] is a single-shot, shoulder-fired, break open grenade launcher which fires a 40 x46 mm grenade and first appeared during the Vietnam War. See [http://www.eurokompozit.com.mk/LAUNCHER/osa/OSA%20800X600.htm Eurokompozit: M79].</ref> His Platoon Commander, Lieutenant Ronald D. Castille was seriously wounded and he fell, unable to move. Using his own body, Mendez shielded Lt. Castille as he applied a dressing to the wound, he then picked up the Lieutenant and started to carry him to friendly lines, which were more than seventy-five meters away. Mendez was hit in the shoulder and two of his comrades rushed to help him with their commander, he refused to let go of his platoon commander and chose to act as rear man. Mendez continued to shield his Lieutenant with his own body until he was mortally wounded. Mendez was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross and promoted to Sergeant. <ref name="AM">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-12-20

for service as set forth in the following Citation:
[[Image:Navycross.jpg|right]]
:For extraordinary heroism while serving as a Platoon Right Guide of the Third Platoon, Company F, Second Battalion, Seventh Marines, in the Republic of Vietnam on 16 March 1967. During Operation DE SOTO in Quang Ngai Province, Company F was conducting a [[search and destroy]] mission when the rear elements of the company were taken under intense 50-caliber [[machine gun]] and [[automatic weapon]]s fire from an estimated hard-core Viet Cong battalion. One half of the Second Platoon was pinned down in an open rice paddy and all attempts to relieve the pressure on the beleaguered Marines had proven futile. Sergeant (then Corporal) Mendez, unhesitatingly volunteered to lead a squad into the face of the devastating and extremely accurate machine gun fire to assist the pinned-down Marines in returning to friendly lines with their two dead and two seriously wounded. The Viet Cong fire increased to a fever pitch as Sergeant Mendez calmly and courageously moved out onto a paddy dike, completely exposed to the intense fire, and commenced firing his M-79 at the enemy positions with deadly accuracy. He fired round after round as he stood, bravely defying the enemy, to give covering fire to his comrades. Sixty meters across the rice paddy from Sergeant Mendez, his Platoon Commander was seriously wounded and he fell, unable to move. Immediately Sergeant Mendez raced through the hail of bullets to his Platoon Commander's side. Shielding him with his body as he applied a dressing to the wound, he picked up the Lieutenant and started to carry him to friendly lines, which were more than seventy-five meters away. Exhibiting exceptional courage he moved toward the lines as the Viet Cong attempted to hit this double target. Twenty meters short of his goal, he was hit in the shoulder and two of his comrades ran out to assist him. Even though painfully wounded, Sergeant Mendez chose to be the rear man, refusing to relinquish his hold on his Lieutenant's legs as they carried him toward the hedgerow. He was shielding his Lieutenant with his own body when he was mortally wounded. By his dauntless courage, initiative and selfless efforts on behalf of another, Sergeant Mendez saved his Platoon Commander's life and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the [[Department of the Navy|United States Naval Service]]. He gallantly gave his life for his country.<ref>[http://www.homeofheroes.com/valor/1_Citations/07_RVN-nc/nc_19rvn_usmcL.html Mendez' Navy Cross citation]</ref>

==Postscript==
On March 1967, Sergeant Angel Mendez's body was sent to Puerto Rico for funeral services upon the request of his father. Mendez's siblings believed that their brother should be buried in New York and two weeks later his body was sent to Staten Island where he was buried with [[full military honors]] on the grounds of the mission where he grew up at Mount Loretto.<ref name="AM">[http://www.virtualwall.org/dm/MendezAx01a.htm Angel Mendez]</ref> He was survived by his parents and his siblings, Ismael, Edwin, Carmen, Anibal, Maria, Betty and Anthony. 

Senator [[Charles Schumer]], senior [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] from the state of New York prompted by the men of the Island's [[Marine Corps League]] detachment and supported by the man whom Mendez saved, the Honorable Ronald D. Castille, former district attorney of [[Philadelphia]] and now one of the seven justices of the [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]],<ref>[http://www.courts.state.pa.us/Index/Supreme/Castille.asp Honorable Ronald D. Castille]</ref>are calling for Mendez to be recognized with the highest military honor of the United States, the Medal of Honor.
 
The request lacked some vital information and in 2003, a meeting was held in Mt. Loretto, by Mr. Al Richichi, President and the Board of managers of the Mt. Loretto Alumni Association, Bruce W. Barraclough, Sr., John C. Gallo and Ismael Mendez and his wife Aida Mendez next of kin to Angel Mendez. This meeting was held to bring those involved up to date on the intentions of Barraclough and Gallo quest to honor Angel Mendez, and to get the family's permission to submit a new request for the Medal of Honor. In October, 2003 Barraclough and Gallo had finished writing up the new request which had presented only the facts, and added a petition signed by many organizations, Society's, along with many signatures from Staten Island, New Yorkers.<ref name="AM">[http://www.virtualwall.org/dm/MendezAx01a.htm Angel Mendez]</ref>
