== John J. Bagley ==

He was instrumental in the creation of the Detroit Metropolitan Police Commission and the construction of the first Detroit House of Correction.<ref name = "city"/>  When Bagley died in 1881, his will contained $5,000 for the construction of a drinking fountain for the people of Detroit, having "water cold and pure as the coldest mountain stream."<ref name = "city"/>

In 1885, the Bagley family chose [[Henry Hobson Richardson]] to design the fountain.<ref name = "hhr">[http://books.google.com/books?id=gBDXfLHsnc4C Jeffrey Karl Ochsner,] ''H.H. Richardson, Complete Architectural Works,'' MIT Press, 1982, ISBN 0262650150, p. 400.</ref>  In 1887, the Bagley Memorial Fountain was dedicated at the corner of [[Woodward Avenue]] and Fort Street.   Richardson constructed the fountain entirely out of pink [[Bragville granite]], modeled after a [[ciborium]] located in [[St. Mark<U+2019>s Basilica]] in [[Venice]].<ref name = "city"/> The Bagley Memorial Fountain stands 21 feet high with a basin 7 feet across. At the center of the fountain, four lion heads distribute water. In the original design, two of the heads produced "normal" temperature water and the other two produced cold water, chilled by ice packed around the fountain pipes.<ref name = "city"/> The inscription on the four sides of the cornice reads: TESTAMENTARY GIFT | FOR THE PEOPLE FROM | JOHN JVDSON BAGLEY | A.D. MDCCCLXXXVII.

== Later moves ==
In 1926 the fountain was moved from its original home at Woodward and Fort to Campus Martius because of the increase of automobile traffic.<ref name = "city"/>  In 2000, the fountain was removed from it site, disassembled, and put into storage.<ref name = "wat">[http://www.dwsd.org/announce/flow/InTheFlow_winter_2007.pdf "Bagley Fountain Makes a Comeback,"] ''In the Flow,'' Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, V7 n1 (Winter 2007)</ref>  In 2007, the fountain was installed in its current location in Cadillac Square; a new lion fountainhead replaced the original, which was stolen.<ref name = "wat"/>  It is the only remaining work by Richardson in the Detroit area.<ref name = "city"/>
