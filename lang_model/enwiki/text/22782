'''Iron pentacarbonyl''', also known as '''iron carbonyl''', is the [[chemical compound|compound]] with [[chemical formula|formula]]   {{iron}}({{carbon}}{{oxygen}})<sub>5</sub>. Under [[standard conditions]] Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> is a free-flowing, straw-colored liquid with a pungent odour.  This compound is a common precursor to diverse iron compounds, including many that are useful in [[organic synthesis]].<ref>Samson, S. ; Stephenson, G. R. "Pentacarbonyliron" in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis (Ed: L. Paquette) 2004, J. Wiley & Sons, New York. DOI: 10.1002/047084289.</ref>  Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> is prepared by the reaction of fine [[iron]] particles with [[carbon monoxide]].  Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> is inexpensively purchased.

Iron pentacarbonyl is one of the [[homoleptic]] [[metal carbonyl]]s; i.e. [[complex (chemistry)|metal complexes]] bonded only to [[carbon monoxide|CO]] ligands.  Other examples include octahedral [[chromium hexacarbonyl|Cr(CO)<sub>6</sub>]] and [[tetrahedral]] [[nickel carbonyl|Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>]]. Most metal carbonyls have [[electron counting|18 valence electrons]], and Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> fits this pattern with 8 valence electrons on Fe and five pairs of electrons provided by the CO ligands.  Reflecting its symmetrical structure and charge neutrality, Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> is [[vapour pressure|volatile]]; it is one of the most frequently encountered liquid metal complexes.  Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> adopts a trigonal bipyramidal structure with the Fe atom surrounded by five CO [[ligand]]s: three in [[equatorial]] positions and two axially bound.  The Fe-C-O linkages are each linear.

Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> is the archetypal [[fluxional molecule]] due to the rapid interchange of the axial and equatorial CO groups via the [[Berry mechanism]] on the [[NMR spectroscopy|NMR timescale]].  Consequently, the<sup>13</sup>C [[NMR]] spectrum exhibits only one signal due to the rapid interchange between nonequivalent CO sites.

Iron carbonyl is sometimes confused with [[carbonyl iron]], a high-purity metal prepared by decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl.

==Synthesis and other iron carbonyls==
The compound was described in a journal by [[Ludwig Mond|Mond]] and Langer in 1891 as "a somewhat viscous liquid of a pale-yellow colour."<ref>{{cite journal | author = [[Ludwig Mond|Mond, L.]]; Langer, C. | title = On iron carbonyls | journal = J. Chem. Soc., Trans. | year = 1891 | volume = 59 | pages = 1090<U+2013>1093 | doi = 10.1039/CT8915901090}}</ref>  Samples were prepared by treatment of finely divided, oxide-free iron powder with carbon monoxide at room temperature.

Photolysis of Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> produces [[diiron nonacarbonyl|Fe<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>9</sub>]], a yellow-orange solid, also described by Mond.  When heated, Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> converts to small amounts of the [[metal cluster]] [[triiron dodecacarbonyl|Fe<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>]], a green solid, although simple thermolysis is not a useful synthesis (see below).  Each iron carbonyl exhibits distinct reactivity.

==Key reactions==
===CO substitution reactions===
Thousands of compounds are derived from Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>.  Substitution of CO by [[Lewis base]]s, L, to give derivatives Fe(CO)<sub>5-x</sub>L<sub>x</sub>.  Common Lewis bases include [[isocyanide]]s,  tertiary [[phosphine]]s and [[arsine]]s, and [[alkene]]s.  Usually these ligands displace only one or two CO ligands, but certain acceptor ligands such as PF<sub>3</sub> and isocyanides can proceed to tetra- and pentasubstitution.  These reactions are often induced with a catalyst or light.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Therien, M. J. and Trogler, W. C. | title = Bis(phosphine) derivatives of iron pentacarbonyl and tetracarbonyl(tri-tert-butylphosphine)iron(0) | journal = [[Inorg. Synth.]] | year = 1990 | volume = 28 | pages = 173<U+2013>9 | doi = 10.1002/9780470132593.ch45}}</ref>  Illustrative is the synthesis of the bis(triphenylphosphine) complex Fe(CO)<sub>3</sub>(P(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Keiter, R. L.; Keiter, E. A.; Boecker, C. A.; Miller, D. R. and Hecker, K. H. | title = Tricarbonylbis(phosphine)iron(0) complexes | journal = [[Inorg. Synth.]] | year = 1997 | volume = 31 | pages = 210<U+2013>214 | doi = 10.1002/9780470132623.ch31}}</ref>  This transformation can be accomplished photochemically, but it is also induced by the addition of NaOH or [[Sodium borohydride|NaBH<sub>4</sub>]].  The catalyst attacks a CO ligand, which labilizes another CO ligand toward substitution.  The electrophilicity of Fe(CO)<sub>4</sub>L is less than that of Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>, so the nucleophilic catalyst, disengages and attacks another molecule of Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>.

===Oxidation and reduction===
Most metal carbonyls can be halogenated.  Thus, treatment of Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> with [[halogen]]s gives the ferrous halides Fe(CO)<sub>4</sub>X<sub>2</sub> for X = I, Br, Cl. These species, upon heating lose CO to give the ferrous halides, such as [[iron(II) chloride]].

Reduction of Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> with Na gives [[Disodium tetracarbonylferrate|Na<sub>2</sub>Fe(CO)<sub>4</sub>]], "tetracarbonylferrate" also called Collman's reagent.  The dianion is isoelectronic with Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub> but highly [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]].<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = Finke, R. G.; Sorrell, T. N. | title = Nucleophilic Acylation with Disodium Tetracarbonylferrate: Methyl 7-Oxoheptanoate and Methyl 7-oxooctonoate | collvol = 6 | collvolpages = 807 | prep = cv6p0807}}</ref>

===Acid-base reactions===
Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> is not readily [[protonation|protonated]], but it is attacked by [[hydroxide]].  Treatment of Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> with aqueous base produces [HFe(CO)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>-</sup>, the [[redox|oxidation]] of which gives Fe<sub>3</sub>(CO)<sub>12</sub>.  Acidification of solutions of  [HFe(CO)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>-</sup> gives H<sub>2</sub>Fe(CO)<sub>4</sub>, the first metal hydride ever reported.

===Diene adducts===
Dienes react with Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> to give (diene)Fe(CO)<sub>3</sub>, wherein two CO ligands have been replaced by two olefins.  Many dienes undergo this reaction, notably [[norbornadiene]] and [[1,3-butadiene]].  One of the more historically significant derivatives is [[cyclobutadieneiron tricarbonyl]]  (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)Fe(CO)<sub>3</sub>, where C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub> is the otherwise unstable [[cyclobutadiene]].<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = Pettit, R.; Henery, J. | title = Cyclobutadieneiron Tricarbonyl | collvol = 6 | collvolpages = 310 | prep = cv6p0310}}</ref>  Receiving the greatest attention are complexes of the cyclohexadienes, the parent organic 1,4-dienes being available through the [[Birch reduction]]s.  1,4-Dienes isomerize to the 1,3-dienes upon complexation.<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = [[Arthur Birch|Birch, A. J.]]; Chamberlain, K. B. | title =<nowiki>Tricarbonyl[(2,3,4,5-eta)-2,4-Cyclohexadien-1-one]ison and Tricarbonyl[(1,2,3,4,5-eta)-2-Methoxy-2,4-Cyclohexadien-1-yl]Iron(1+) Hexafluorophosphate(1-) from Anisole</nowiki> | collvol = 6 | collvolpages = 996 | prep = cv6p0996}}</ref>

Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> reacts in [[dicyclopentadiene]] to form [Fe(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(CO)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>, [[cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl dimer]].  This compound, called "Fp dimer" can be considered a hybrid of [[ferrocene]] and Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>, although in terms of its reactivity, it resembles neither.

==Other uses==
In [[Europe]], iron pentacarbonyl was once used as an [[anti-knock agent]] in [[petrol]] in place of [[tetraethyllead]].  Two more modern alternative fuel additives are [[ferrocene]] and [[Methylcyclopentadienyl Manganese Tricarbonyl|methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl]].  Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> is used in the production of "[[carbonyl iron]]", a finely divided form of Fe, a material used in [[magnetic core]]s of high-frequency [[coil]]s for [[radio]]s and [[television]]s and for manufacture of the active ingredients of some [[radar absorbent material]]s (e.g. [[iron ball paint]]). It is famous as a chemical precursor for the synthesis of various iron-based [[nanoparticle]]s.

Iron pentacarbonyl has been found to be a strong flame speed inhibitor in oxygen based flames.<ref>

</ref> Few hundred ppm of iron pentacarbonyl are known to reduce the flame speed of [[stoichiometric]] [[methane]]-air flame by al most 50%. However due to its toxic nature it has not been used widely as flame retardant.

==Toxicity and hazards==
Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> is toxic, which is of concern because of its volatility (vapour pressure: 21 mmHg at 20 <U+00B0>C).  If [[inhale]]d, iron pentacarbonyl may cause lung irritation, [[toxic pneumonitis]], or [[pulmonary edema]].  Like other metal carbonyls, Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> is [[flammable]]. It is, however, considerably less toxic than [[nickel tetracarbonyl]].
