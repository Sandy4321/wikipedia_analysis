'''''Surprise Surprise''''' is the 1982 studio album of [[Mezzoforte (band)|Mezzoforte]] on [[Sena (record company)|Steinar]].<ref name=web>{{cite web|url=http://www.mezzoforte.com/disco.html|title=Mezzoforte|publisher=|accessdate=18 September 2014}}</ref> Their fourth album - originally released in Iceland as ''4'' with a different cover - made the band famous worldwide when, after the international release, the single ''Garden Party'' hit the charts.<ref name=ln>liner notes</ref>

== Background ==
Earlier in 1982 the second keyboard player, Bjorn Thorarensen who's been with them for their previous two albums, left Mezzoforte. The saxophone player Kristinn Svavarsson became a full member after playing as a guest on the band's first two albums. ''Surprise Surprise'' was recorded at PRT Studios, London in July<U+2013>August 1982 and mixed at Red Bus Studios in September. It was the second time the band worked with producer Geoff Calver in London after the recording of their second album [[<U+00CD> Hakanum/Octopus|<U+00CD> Hakanum]] - released internationally as Mezzoforte and re-released as Octopus in 1996 - in 1980. Despite gaining some popularity and playing concerts in the UK, the album was first released in Iceland in 1982 simply named ''4'' and then renamed ''Surprise Surprise'' for the international release.

== Cover ==
''Surprise Surprise'' was originally released in Iceland as ''4'' with a different cover, but the record company decided to use the cover of Mezzoforte's third album - ''[[<U+00DE>v<U+00ED>l<U+00ED>kt Og Anna<U+00F0> Eins]]'', released only in Iceland - for the international release.<ref name=web/><ref name=ln/> The 1996 remastered version was released with the slightly modified international cover. This edition has a few discrepancies:<ref name=cover>as on album cover</ref> Chris Hunter and Bill Eldridge are credited as trumpet and saxophone players respectively - this mistake was even present on the band's official website for a while<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mezzoforte.com/surprise.htm|title=Surprise Surprise|publisher=|accessdate=17 July 2001}}</ref> - Eirikur Ingolfsson is not credited as percussionist, and Shady Calver is credited on her maiden name: Shady Owens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/2021460-Shady-Owens|title=Shady Owens|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref>

== Garden Party ==
''Garden Party'' was chosen to be released as a single, the song, which the band wasn't sure to include on the album. It became Mezzoforte's biggest hit in most European countries and Japan. After its success the band moved to England and started touring in Europe.<ref name=ln/> ''Garden Party'' was featured in TV programmes, commercials, etc. gaining even more publicity for Mezzoforte throughout the years.
