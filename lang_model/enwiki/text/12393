{{wikinews|North America's oldest retailer sold to U.S. owners of Lord & Taylor}}
The '''Hudson's Bay Company''' ({{lang-fr|Compagnie de la Baie d'Hudson}}), abbreviated '''HBC''', or "The Bay" ("La Baie" in French) is the oldest commercial [[corporation]] in [[North America]] and one of the [[List of oldest companies|oldest in the world]]. A [[fur trade|fur trading]] business for much of its existence, today Hudson's Bay Company owns and operates [[Retailing|retail stores]] throughout [[Canada]]. The company is headquartered in the [[Simpson Tower]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].<ref>"[http://www.hbc.com/hbc/about/contacts/ Contacts]." Hudson's Bay Company. Retrieved on 7 July 2010.</ref>

The company was incorporated by [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[royal charter]] in 1670 as '''The Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay''' and functioned as the ''[[de facto]]'' government in parts of North America before [[Europe]]an states and later the [[United States]] laid claim to those territories. It was at one time the largest landowner in the world, with [[Rupert's Land]] having 15% of North American acreage. From its long time headquarters at [[York Factory, Manitoba|York Factory]] on [[Hudson Bay]], the company controlled the [[fur trade]] throughout much of [[United Kingdom|British]]-controlled North America for several centuries. Undertaking early exploration, its traders and trappers forged early relationships with many groups of [[First Nations]]/[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Its network of [[factory (trading post)|trading posts]] formed the nucleus for later official authority in many areas of [[Western Canada]] and the [[United States]]. In the late 19th century, its vast territory became the largest component in the newly formed [[Dominion of Canada]], in which the company was the largest private landowner.

With the decline of the fur trade, the company evolved into a mercantile business selling vital goods to settlers in the [[Canadian West]]. Today the company owns several Canadian retail chains including [[The Bay]], [[Zellers]], [[Home Outfitters]], and [[Fields (department store)|Fields]]. The [[Hudson's Bay Company Archives]], a collection of the company's many records and maps, are located in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]].

The company is owned by [[Hudson's Bay Trading Company]], the portfolio company of the United States private equity firm [[NRDC Equity Partners]], which also owns [[Lord & Taylor]], a high-end department store chain in the U.S.

==History==
{{Ref improve section|date=June 2009}}

===Early years===
[[Image:Hudsons Bay Company Flag.svg|right|200px|thumb|[[Flag of the Hudson's Bay Company]] which originated from its days as a British trading company.]]

In the 17th century, the [[France|French]] had a [[monopoly]] on the Canadian [[fur trade]]. However, two French traders, [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson]] and [[M<U+00E9>dard des Groseilliers]], learned from the [[Cree]] that the best fur country was north and west of [[Lake Superior]] and that there was a "frozen sea" still further north. Correctly guessing that this was [[Hudson Bay]], they sought French backing for a plan to set up a trading post on the Bay, thus reducing the cost of moving furs overland. But, the recently appointed French Secretary of State, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], was trying to promote farming in the colony and was opposed to exploration and trapping.

Radisson and des Groseilliers approached a group of businessmen in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] to help finance their explorations. The Bostonians agreed on the plan's merits, and brought the two to England to elicit financing. In 1668, the English commissioned two ships, the ''[[Nonsuch (ship)|Nonsuch]]'' and the ''Eaglet'', to explore possible trade into [[Hudson Bay]]. The ''Nonsuch'' was commanded by Captain Zachariah Gillam and accompanied by des Groseilliers, while the ''Eaglet'' was commanded by Captain William Stannard and accompanied by Radisson. On June 5, 1668, both ships left port at [[Deptford]], [[England]], but the "Eaglet" was forced to turn back off the coast of [[Ireland]].

The ''Nonsuch'' continued to the southern portion of [[James Bay]], where its explorers founded [[Waskaganish, Quebec|Fort Rupert]] at the mouth of the [[Rupert River]]. Both the fort and the river were named after the sponsor of the expedition, [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]. After a successful trading expedition over the winter of 1668<U+2013>9, the ''Nonsuch'' returned to England.

[[File:Ruperts land.svg|right|thumb|Rupert's Land, the [[drainage basin]] of Hudson Bay, the Company's grant.]]

The Governor and Company of Adventurers of England Trading into Hudson's Bay was incorporated on May 2, 1670, with a [[royal charter]] from King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. The charter granted the company a monopoly over the [[Indian Trade]], especially the [[fur]] trade, in the region watered by all rivers and streams flowing into [[Hudson Bay]] in northern Canada.  The area was called [[Rupert's Land]] after [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]], the first director of the company and a first cousin of King Charles. This region constitutes 1.5 million square miles (3.9 million km<U+00B2>) in the [[drainage basin]] of [[Hudson Bay]], comprising over 1/3 the area of modern day Canada and stretching into the north central [[United States]].  The specific boundaries were unknown at the time. Rupert's Land would eventually be Canada's largest land purchase in the 1800s.

The company founded its first headquarters at Fort Nelson at the mouth of the [[Nelson River]] in present day northeastern [[Manitoba]]. The location afforded convenient access to the fort from the vast interior waterway systems of the [[Saskatchewan River|Saskatchewan]] and [[Red River of the North|Red]] rivers. The English quickly built other posts around the southern edge of Hudson Bay in Manitoba and present day [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], such as at Fort Severn, built in 1689. Called "[[factory (trading post)|factories]]" (because the "factor," i.e. a person acting as a [[mercantile agent]] did business from there), these posts operated in the manner of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] fur trading operations in [[New Netherland]].

The Hudson's Bay Company's second inland trading post was established by [[Samuel Hearne]] in 1774 in Cumberland House, Saskatchewan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hbc.com/hbcheritage/history/people/explorers/samuelhearne.asp |title=Our History: People |accessdate=2007-11-14 |publisher=Hudson's Bay Company}}</ref>

During the spring and summer, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|First Nations]] and [[M<U+00E9>tis]] trappers did the vast majority of the animal trapping and pelt preparation.  They travelled by [[canoe]] and walking, being received at the fort to sell their pelts. In exchange they typically received metal tools and hunting gear, often imported by the company from [[Germany]], the centre of inexpensive manufacturing in that era. 

[[Image:Hudsons Bay-Logo-Old.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Logo on old fur trading fort.]]

The early coastal [[factory (trading post)]] model contrasted with the system of the French, who established an extensive system of inland posts and sent traders to live among the tribes of the region.  In March 1686, the French sent a [[Hudson Bay expedition (1686)|raiding party]] under the [[Pierre de Troyes, Chevalier de Troyes|Chevalier des Troyes]] over 1,300&nbsp;km (800 miles) to capture the company's posts along James Bay. The French appointed [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]], who had shown great heroism during the raids, as commander of the company's captured posts.  In 1687 an English attempt to [[Battle of Fort Albany|resettle Fort Albany]] failed due to ruses and deceptions by d'Iberville.  After 1688 the two kingdoms [[King William's War|were officially at war]]. D'Iberville raided Fort Severn in 1690 but did not attempt to raid the well defended local headquarters at [[York Factory, Manitoba|York Factory]].  In 1693 the company [[Battle of Fort Albany (1693)|recovered Fort Albany]]; d'Iberville [[Capture of York Factory|captured York Factory]] in 1694, but the company recovered it the next year.  In 1697, d'Iberville again commanded a French naval raid on York Factory. On the way to the fort, he defeated three ships of the Royal Navy in the [[Battle of Hudson's Bay]], the largest naval battle in the history of the North American Arctic.  D'Iberville's depleted French force captured York Factory by a ruse; they laid siege to the fort while pretending to be a much larger army, the French held all of the outposts except Fort Albany until 1713.  (Fort Albany was again [[Battle of Fort Albany (1709)|unsuccessfully attacked in 1709]] by a small French and Indian force.)  The economic consequences of the French possession to the company were significant; it did not pay any dividends for more than 20 years. See [[Anglo-French conflicts on Hudson Bay]].

The Rupert's Land territory was ceded to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] (so named following the union of Scotland and England in 1707) in the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]]. After the treaty, the company rebuilt York Factory as a brick [[star fort]] at the mouth of the nearby [[Hayes River]], its present location. In 1782, during the [[Naval operations in the American Revolutionary War|American Revolutionary War]], a French squadron under [[Jean-Fran<U+00E7>ois de Galaup, comte de La P<U+00E9>rouse]] [[Hudson Bay expedition|captured and demolished]] York Factory and [[Prince of Wales Fort]].

In its trade with native peoples, the Hudson's Bay Company exchanged [[wool]] blankets, called [[Hudson's Bay point blanket]]s, for the beaver pelts trapped by aboriginal hunters. The number of [[indigo]] stripes (aka points) woven into the blankets identified its weight and size. An occasional misconception is that the number of stripes is related to its trade value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbc.com/hbcheritage/history/blanket/history/ |title=Hudson's Bay Company website |publisher=Hbc.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref>

A parallel may be drawn between HBC's control over Rupert's Land with the trade monopoly and government functions enjoyed by the [[Honourable East India Company]] over India during roughly the same period.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

===19th century===
[[Image:HBC-coa.JPG|thumb|HBC coat of arms, showing the Latin motto ''pro pelle cutem'': a skin for a skin.]]

In 1821, the [[North West Company]] of [[Montreal]] and Hudson's Bay Company merged.  Their combined territory was extended by a licence to the [[North-Western Territory]], so it reached to the [[Arctic Ocean]] on the North and the [[Pacific Ocean]] on the West.  Before the merger, the employees of the HBC, unlike the North West Company, did not participate in its profits. After the merger, with all operations under the management of Sir [[George Simpson (administrator)|George Simpson]] (1826<U+2013>1860), the company had a corps of commissioned officers, 25 chief factors and 28 chief traders, who shared in the profits of the company during the monopoly years. Its trade covered 7,770,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (3,000,000 square miles), and it had 1,500 contract employees.<ref name=galbraith>{{cite book |last=Galbraith |first=John S. |title=The Hudson's Bay Company As an Imperial Factor 1821<U+2013>1869 |publisher=University of California Press |year=1957 |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles}}</ref>{{Rp|8<U+2013>23}}

The progression for officers, together referred to as the Commissioned Gentlemen, was to enter the company as a fur trader.  Typically, they were men who had the capital to invest in starting up their trading.  They sought to be promoted to the rank of Chief Trader.  A Chief Trader would be in charge of an individual post and was entitled to one share of the profits of the company.  Chief Factors sat in council with the Governors and were the heads of districts.  They were entitled to two shares of the profits or the losses of the company.  The average income of a Chief Trader was <U+00A3>360 and that of a Chief Factor was <U+00A3>720.<ref name=Morton>{{cite book |last=Morton   |first=Arthur S |coauthors=(Lewis G Thomas) |title=A History of the Canadian West to 1870-71 |place=Toronto |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1973 |origyear=1939  |location=Toronto |edition=2nd ed |isbn=0-8020-4033-0}}</ref>{{Rp|690}}

[[Image:Hbc post Lake Winnipeg.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A Hudson's Bay Company post on [[Lake Winnipeg]], [[Circa|c.]]1884.]]

Although the HBC maintained a monopoly on the fur trade during the early mid 19th century, there was competition from James Sinclair and [[Andrew McDermot]] (Dermott), independent traders in the [[Red River Colony]].  They shipped furs by the [[Red River Trails]] to [[Norman Kittson]]<ref name=galbraith/>{{Rp|60<U+2013>72}} a buyer in the United States. In addition, Americans controlled the [[Maritime Fur Trade]] on the Northwest Coast until the 1840s.

Throughout the 1820s and 1830s, the HBC controlled nearly all trading operations in the [[Pacific Northwest]], based out of the company headquarters at [[Fort Vancouver]] on the [[Columbia River]]. Although authority over the region was nominally shared by the United States and Britain through the [[Anglo-American Convention of 1818]], company policy, enforced via Chief Factor [[John McLoughlin]] of the company's Columbia District, was to discourage U.S. settlement of the territory. The company's effective monopoly on trade virtually forbade any settlement in the region. It established [[Fort Boise]] in 1834 (in present-day southwestern Idaho) to compete with the American [[Fort Hall]], 483&nbsp;km (300 miles) to the east. In 1837, it purchased [[Fort Hall]], also along the route of the [[Oregon Trail]], where the outpost director displayed the abandoned wagons of discouraged settlers to those seeking to move west along the trail.

The company's stranglehold on the region was broken by the [[Wagon Train of 1843|first successful large wagon train to reach Oregon in 1843]], led by [[Marcus Whitman]]. In the years that followed, thousands of [[emigrant]]s poured into the [[Willamette Valley]]. In 1846, the United States acquired full authority of the most settled areas of the Oregon Country south of the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]]. McLoughlin, who had once turned away would be settlers as company director, then welcomed them from his general store at [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] and was later proclaimed the "Father of [[Oregon]]". The company retains no presence today in what is now the United States portion of the [[Pacific Northwest]].

During the 1820s and 1830s, HBC trappers were deeply involved in the early exploration and development of [[Northern California]]. Company trapping brigades were sent south from Fort Vancouver, along what became known as the [[Siskiyou Trail]], into Northern California as far south as the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. These trapping brigades in Northern California faced serious risks, and were often the first to explore relatively uncharted territory.<!--selection of examples would be useful; Peter Skene Ogden, Samuel Black, others of the lesser known but important HBC explorers-->

Between 1820 and 1870, HBC issued its own [[paper money]]. The notes, denominated in [[pounds sterling]], were printed in London and issued at the [[York Factory]], [[Fort Garry]] and the [[Red River colony]].

The [[Guillaume Sayer]] Trial in 1849 contributed to the end of the HBC monopoly. Sayer, a [[M<U+00E9>tis people (Canada)|M<U+00E9>tis]] trapper and trader, was accused of the illegal trading of furs.  The Court of [[Assiniboia]] brought Sayer to trial, before a jury of HBC officials and supporters. During the trial, a crowd of armed [[M<U+00E9>tis]] men led by [[Louis Riel Sr.]] gathered outside the courtroom. Although Sayer was found guilty of illegal trade, having evaded the HBC monopoly, Judge Adam Thom did not levy a fine or punishment.  Some accounts attributed that to the intimidating armed crowd gathered outside the courthouse. With the cry, ''Le commerce est libre! Le commerce est libre!'' ("Trade is free! Trade is free!"), the M<U+00E9>tis loosened the HBC's previous control of the courts, which had enforced their monopoly on the settlers of Red River.

Another factor was the findings of the [[Palliser Expedition]] of 1857 to 1860, led by Captain [[John Palliser]]. Although he initially recommended against settlement of the region the report sparked a debate.  That ended the myth publicized by the Hudson's Bay Company that the Canadian West was unfit for agricultural settlement. In 1863, the International Financial Society became the majority shareholders of the HBC.

In 1870, the government abolished the HBC monopoly and opened trade in the region to any [[entrepreneur]]. The company relinquished its ownership of Rupert's Land under the [[Rupert's Land Act 1868]], enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

===Modern operations===
[[File:Simpson Tower.JPG|thumb|[[Simpson Tower]], headquarters]]
Hudson's Bay Company Stores first operated from the trading posts that were established across northern Canada. Today, this is the only part of the company operation remaining, in the form of department stores under the name ''The Bay''. The first department store opened in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]] in 1881 (this building is considered the flagship store). Others soon followed. Until quite recently, many Hudson's Bay Company stores were the only stores in remote towns. More recently, the stores in major downtown locations have been transformed into boutiques.

In 1970, on the 300th anniversary of the company, head office functions were transferred from [[London]] to Winnipeg. As the company expanded into the East, head office functions were moved to [[Toronto]].

Since the [[Designer Depot]] was sold for lagging sales performance, today the company has four retail divisions: [[The Bay]], [[Zellers]], [[Home Outfitters]], and [[Fields (department store)|Fields]]. ''Northern Stores'' are no longer operated by HBC, but by a corporation organized in 1987 under the name [[The North West Company]]. [[Simpson's]] department stores, which were acquired by Hudson's Bay Company in 1978, were converted to ''The Bay'' stores in 1991. In the 1970s and 1980s, HBC operated a chain of catalogue stores under the name ''[[Shop-Rite Catalogue Stores]]''. In these stores, little merchandise was displayed; customers made their selections from catalogues, and staff would retrieve the merchandise from storerooms. This form of retailing, now largely disappeared, was referred to as "catalogue showroom"; [[Consumers Distributing]] was left with a near monopoly on the format in Canada.
[[Image:hudsonsbayco.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The Hudson's Bay Company building in Montreal.]]
The legacy of the HBC has been maintained in part by the detailed record-keeping and archiving of material by the Company. Before 1974, the records of the HBC were kept in the London office headquarters. The HBC opened an Archives department to researchers in 1931. In 1974, the Hudson's Bay Company Archives were transferred from London to their Canadian headquarters in Winnipeg.  They granted public access to the collection the following year. In 1991 the archival records of the company were donated to the [[Archives of Manitoba]] in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]].

In 1987, HBC sold off its Canadian fur-auction business to Hudson's Bay Fur Sales Canada. (This company is now known as [[North American Fur Auctions]].) In 1991, [[the Bay]] agreed to stop selling [[fur]] in response to complaints from people opposed to killing animals for this purpose. In 1997, the Bay reopened its fur salons to meet the demand of consumers. [[Animal rights]] groups, such as Freedom for Animals have been campaigning to get the Bay to stop selling furs.

In 1994, the HBC donated the Company records to the Province of Manitoba. The appraised value of the records was nearly $60 million. A foundation, funded through the tax savings resulting from the donation, was established to support the operations of the HBCA as a division of the Archives of Manitoba, along with other activities and programs. More than two kilometres of filed documents, as well as hundreds of microfilm reels, are now stored in a special climate-controlled vault in the Manitoba Archives Building.

In December 2003, Maple Leaf Heritage Investments, a [[Nova Scotia]]-based company created to acquire shares of Hudson's Bay Company, announced that it was considering making an offer to acquire all or some of the common shares of Hudson's Bay Company. Maple Leaf Heritage Investments is a subsidiary of B-Bay Inc.  Its CEO and chairman is [[United States|American]] businesswoman, Anita Zucker, widow of [[Jerry Zucker (businessman)|Jerry Zucker]]. Zucker had previously been the head of the [[Polymer Group]], which acquired another Canadian institution, the [[Dominion Textile|Dominion Textile Company]].

On January 26, 2006, HBC's board unanimously agreed to a bid of $15.25 CAD/share from Jerry Zucker whose original bid was $14.75 CAD/share, ending a prolonged fight between HBC and Zucker.  The [[South Carolina]] billionaire financier was a longtime HBC minority shareholder. In a March 9, 2006 [http://www.hbc.com/hbc/mediacentre/press/hbc/press.asp?prId=214 press release], HBC announced that Zucker would replace [[George Heller]] as the new [[Governor]] and [[CEO]], to become the first US citizen to lead the company. After Zucker's death, the board named his widow [[Anita Zucker]] as HBC Governor and HBC Deputy-Governor [[Rob Johnston]] as CEO.<ref>CBC Newsworld, 14 April 2008</ref>

In 2008, after Zucker's death, the company was sold to NRDC Equity Partners, the private equity firm of [[Purchase, New York]].  In the United States, NRDC Equity Partners  operates [[Lord & Taylor]], the oldest department store chain in the U.S.  The Canadian and U.S. holdings are part of NRDC Equity Partners' portfolio company, [[Hudson's Bay Trading Company]], as of the fall of 2008.

In 2007, the [[Hudson's Bay Company Archives]] became part of the [[United Nations]] "[[Memory of the World]]" project, under [[UNESCO]]. The records covered HBC history from the founding of the company in 1670. The records contained business transactions, medical records, personal journals of officials, inventories, company reports, etc.

[[File:HBCWinnipeg.JPG|thumb|right|The Bay's, HBC retail building in Winnipeg.]]
Today's modern HBC has diversified into joint ventures and other types of business products. HBC has credit card, mortgage, and personal insurance branches. These other products and services are joint partnerships with other corporations, similar to what [[President's Choice Financial]] brands are to [[Loblaw Companies Limited]]. HBC also has other [[HBC Rewards]] corporate partners such as: [[Imperial Oil]]/[[Esso]], [[M&M Meat Shops]], [[Chapters]]/[[Indigo Books and Music|Indigo]] Books, [[Kelsey's]]/[[Montana's]] Restaurants, [[Thrifty Car Rental]], [[Cineplex Entertainment]] Theatres, etc. HBC Rewards points can be redeemed in house or into corporate partners' gift cards and certificates. Points can also be converted to [[Air Miles]].

HBC is involved in community and charity activities. The [[HBC Rewards Community Program]] help fund raise for community causes. [[HBC Foundation]] is a charity agency involved in social issues and service. HBC formerly sponsored the annual HBC Run for Canada, a series of public-participation runs and walks held across the country on Canada Day to raise funds for Canadian athletes. The company, however, discontinued this event as of 2009. <ref>http://www.hbcrunforcanada.ca/2008/index.php</ref>

The U.S. firm [[NRDC Equity Partners]], LLC, owner of American department store chain [[Lord & Taylor]], announced its purchase of the company on July 16, 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thestar.com/Business/article/461506 |title=New owner to spruce up Bay |accessdate=2008-07-16 |publisher=The Toronto Star | first=David | last=Friend | date=July 16, 2008}}</ref>

On January 13, 2011, HBC announced that U.S.-based discount retailer [[Target Corporation]] would purchase the lease agreements of up to 220 Zellers stores, which have not yet been identified, for C$1.825 billion.<ref name="target-reuters">John Tilak, [http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1326316220110113 "UPDATE 2-Target to enter Canada with Zellers deal, own plans: Target plans to open up to 150 stores in Canada"], [[Reuters]] January 13, 2011.</ref> Under the agreement, Zellers will initially sublease the properties, and continue to operate them as Zellers locations until at least early 2012.

==Rent obligation under charter==
Under the charter forming the Hudson's Bay Company, the company was required to give two [[elk]] skins and two black [[beaver]] pelts to the English King, then [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], or his heirs, whenever the monarch visits an area that was formerly [[Rupert's Land]]. The ceremony was first conducted with the Prince of Wales (the future [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]]) in 1927, then with [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] in 1939, and last with his daughter, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1959 and 1970. On the last such visit, the pelts were given in the form of two live beavers, which the Queen donated to the Winnipeg Zoo in [[Assiniboine Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/business/alliance/hudson.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Fur the Queen |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref> However, when the Company permanently moved its headquarters to Canada, the Charter was amended to remove the rent obligation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbc.com/hbcheritage/history/business/fur/rentceremony.asp |title=Hbc Heritage <U+2013> Our History <U+2013> Business |publisher=Hbc.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref>  Each of the four "rent ceremonies" took place in or around Winnipeg.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Stores owned and operated by HBC==
The Hudson's Bay Company is a parent company to many different retail and online stores, including:

* [[The Bay (Chain store)|The Bay]]
* [[Zellers]]
* [[Home Outfitters]]
* [[Fields (department store)|Fields]]

From 2004 until 2008, HBC also owned and operated a small chain of off-price stores called [[Designer Depot]].  Similar to the [[Winners]] and [[Home Sense]] retail format, Designer Depot did not meet sales expectations, and its nine stores were sold.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.financialpost.com/story.html?id=428721 |title=Hudson's Bay Eager to Log Onto New Era |accessdate=2008-04-08 |publisher=Financial Post/National Post}}</ref>

==Official Outfitter==

HBC was the official outfitter of clothing for members of the Canadian Olympic team in 1936, 1960, 1964, 1968, 2006, 2008 and 2010. The contract will end following the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.

On March 2, 2005, the company was announced as the new clothing outfitter for the Canadian [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] team. The $100 million deal means that The Bay will provide clothing for the 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012 games. The previous Canadian Olympic wear-supplier, [[Roots Canada Ltd.]], ended its involvement with Canada's Olympic teams in 2004. HBC had been criticized for the way the 2008 Summer Olympics uniforms looked, and where they are made. Roots ensured that the clothes were made in Canada using Canadian material, whereas HBC is producing the clothes in Canada and China.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080502/hbc_criticism_080502/20080502?hub=TopStories |title=Canadian Olympic gear made in China, MPs cry foul |accessdate=2008-05-02 |publisher=CTV Global Media}}</ref>  Apparel for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] held in Vancouver prove to be extremely popular, particularly red-and-white mittens featuring a large maple leaf.
