{{for|other ships to have carried the name|HMS Duncan}}

'''HMS ''Duncan''''' is the sixth ship of the [[Type 45 destroyer|Type 45]] or 'D' Class  of [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defence]] destroyer (AAW) planned to be built for the [[Royal Navy]].

HMS ''Duncan'' is named for [[Adam Duncan, Viscount Duncan of Camperdown]] (1 July 1731 - 4 August 1804) who, as Admiral Duncan, defeated the Dutch fleet off [[Camperdown]] on 11 October 1797. This victory is considered one of the most significant actions in naval history. In light of this, there is a strong likelihood of the ''Duncan'' being affiliated with the [[City of Dundee]], in which Adam Duncan was educated.

''Duncan'''s construction began at the [[BAE Systems Naval Ships]] yard at [[Scotstoun]] on the [[River Clyde]] in [[2006]]. 

The Type 45 class is both the first class of warship to include e-mail and entertainment systems (including [[iPod]] charging points) within the messdecks and the first class of Royal Navy vessel to include gender-neutral living spaces to accommodate male and female crew members. 

The ''Daring'' class will be one of the most advanced air-defence warship classes in the world.<ref>{{cite news | title = World's most advanced destroyer launched tomorrow
 | work = [[The Times]] | publisher = Times Newspapers | page = 37 | date = 2007-01-22 | accessdate = 2007-01-23}}</ref> The ship's capabilites centre on the [[SAMPSON]] Multi Function Radar which can detect targets out to a distance of 400 km and the [[PAAMS]] missile system.
