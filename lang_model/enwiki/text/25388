'''Ramy''' "'''Ray'''" '''Brooks''' (born December 24, 1968<ref name="1996a">"1996 Iditarod Mushers: B", para. 11.</ref> in [[Fairbanks, Alaska]]) is an [[Alaska Native]] [[kennel]] owner and operator, [[motivational speaker]], and [[mushing|dog musher]] who specializes in long-distance races. He is a two-time runner up in the 1,049+ mi (1,600+ km) [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]] across the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Alaska]], and a former winner of the 1,000&nbsp;mi (1,600&nbsp;km) [[Yukon Quest]] dog sled race across both [[Canada]] and the U.S. He is currently on probation from the Iditarod after completing a two year suspension for beating his animals, one of which died the day after the beating.

==Family==
Brooks is descended from the [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]] [[Eskimo]]s and [[Athabascan]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]]s, two of the indigenous groups who were the first to mush dogs in Alaska.<ref name="Meet Ramy a">"Meet Ramy Brooks", para. 3.</ref> His grandfather, [[Gareth Wright]], was a competitive musher who won both major Alaskan sled dog races of the 1940s, the [[American Championship]] (twice), and the [[Fur Rendezvous World Championship]] (three times). Wright was also a [[dog breeder]] and kennel owner who became known for breeding the [[Wright's Aurora Husky]] from the [[Irish Setter]], the [[St. Lawrence Siberian Husky]], and village dogs.<ref name="History a">"History of Sled Dog Racing in Alaska", para. 1, 5.</ref>

Brooks's mother is [[Roxy Wright]] (or Wright-Champaine), another kennel owner and competitive musher. She became the first woman to win both the Fur Rendezvous World Championship in [[Anchorage, Alaska]] and the Open [[North American Championship (mushing)|North American Championship]] in Fairbanks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} She won the open class of each event three times, and the women's classes eight times apiece. In 1990, she also won Europe's largest dog sled race, the [[Alpirod]], across [[Italy]], [[Austria]], and [[France]]. She is also was honored with the Mush with PRIDE Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996, and once competed in the Iditarod.<ref name=PRIDE>"Wright Champaine Earns 1996 Lifetime Award", para. 1, 2, 6.</ref>

Brooks's maternal aunt is Shannon Erhart, who competes in sprint races. She placed third in the Women's Fur Rondezvous race in 2000, and has also raced in the Open Fur Rondezvous. Her ex-husband Curtis Erhart has raced in the [[Kuskokwim 300]].<ref name="Meet Ramy b">"Meet Ramy Brooks", para. 4, 5.</ref>

==Personal History==
Brooks was raised in a [[Yukon River]] [[fish camp]] in the Fairbanks and [[Rampart, Alaska|Rampart]] areas. During the summer he operated a [[fishwheel]], and during the winter he mushed the family dogs. After high school he joined the [[U.S. Navy]] then went to the [[University of Washington]] before returning to Alaska and married his wife, Cathy. His wife was raised in a [[dairy farm]] in [[Pennsylvania]] and attended [[Penn State]], but moved to Alaska where she is employed by the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] and works as the [[4-H]] youth development specialist for the Alaska. Originally they lived in Fairbanks, but moved briefly to [[Delta Junction, Alaska]] then [[Eureka, Alaska]] in 1997, before settling in [[Healy, Alaska]] by 1999.<ref name="Interview b">"Ramy Brooks Interview", para. 1, 3, 4.</ref> They have two young daughters, Abbigal and Molly. The cabin they lived in at Eureka was owned by former Iditarod champion, [[Susan Butcher]]. He and his family are currently living on Murphy Dome Road in Fairbanks Alaska. They still own the {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} kennel in Healy.

The family owns and operates Kami Kennels, primarily composed of [[Alaskan Husky|Alaskan Huskies]].<ref name="Interview b">"Ramy Brooks Interview", dogs section.</ref> ''[[Kami]]'' is a respectful [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for [[sacred]] [[spirit]]s,<ref name=Kami>"Kami", para. 2.</ref> and Brooks chose the name to symbolize the importance of his family. Brooks has visited schools as a motivational speaker since 1993, participates in [[Mush for Kids]] since 1997, and from 2003 has been a [[trustee]] of the [[Alaskan Children's Trust]].

He attempted to commit [[suicide]] at age 16, and suffered from [[clinical depression|depression]] in his 20s. As a result, he began working with the [[Alaska Mental Health Trust]] in 2005, in an attempt to reduce the extraordinarily high rate of suicide among Native Alaskans.<ref name="Musher speaks out">Dillon 1, 2, 6&ndash;8.</ref>

Brooks won his first race, the single-dog [[Junior North American Championship]], when he was four years old, with his dog Sam. He went on to become the first person to win the race three times in a row, and by 14 years of age he had won every class in the race.<ref name="History c">"History of Sled Dog Racing in Alaska", para. 7.</ref> He started competing in long distance races in 1992 and 1993.<ref name="Winner b">"WINNER! Ramy Brooks won the 1999 Yukon Quest!!", para. 3, table.</ref>

Brooks placed 17th in his first Iditarod, in 1994, and won the Rookie of the Year Award. He consistently improved his ranking for the next three years, breaking into the top 10 in 1997 with an 8th place finish.<ref name="Ramy Brooks (Bib 16)"/> After two family deaths less than 10 days before the 1998 race and recurrent dog problems,<ref name="Heavy a">O'Harra, para. 1, 9, 10.</ref> he completed his worst finish in 1998. In 2000, he returned and has consistently placed in the top 10, with his best a back-to-back pair of 2nd place finishes in 2002 and 2003. In 1998, he won the drawing for the [[Joe Redington, Sr.]] Award, and in 2000 he won both the Sportsmanship and Most Improved Musher Awards.<ref name="Ramy Brooks (Bib 16)"/>

Brooks is one of the few Alaskan Natives competing in the modern Iditarod, which is a considerable change from the early days of the Iditarod. In 1976, more than one quarter of the entrants, including the record-breaking [[Emmitt Peters]], were of native descent. The most common reason given for this paucity is the expense of the training and equipping a competitive team. Rural Alaskans find it difficult to acquire the necessary [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]s.<ref name="Hutchison">Hutchison, para. 6&ndash;13.</ref>

==Iditarod disqualification and suspension==
During the [[2007 Iditarod]], witnesses said they saw Brooks punch and kick some of his dogs and hit them with a ski pole when they refused to leave a checkpoint during a March 15, 2007 stage in [[Golovin, Alaska]], less than {{convert|100|mi|km}} from the finish in [[Nome, Alaska]]. Brooks denies the more serious allegations,<ref>[http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7193806.html KOMOTV.com: Iditarod awaits dog abuse report]</ref> but acknowledged "spanking" the dogs in his team with a trail marking lath. One of Brooks<U+2018> dogs died the day after the incident, but a [[necropsy]] could not determine why the dog died and race officials said there was no evidence that Brooks was to blame.<ref>[http://www.heraldnewsdaily.com/stories/index.php?action=fullnews&id=103332  Herald News Daily: Iditarod organizers hear abuse testimony]</ref> On March 17, 2007, the judges voted unanimously to disqualify Brooks from the 2007 Iditarod.<ref>[http://iditarod.com/press/release/pressrelease_370.html Iditarod XXXV Media Advisory]</ref>

On May 18, 2007, the Iditarod Trail Committee Board of Directors announced that they had suspended Brooks for the 2008 and 2009 race, and following that Brooks would be on probation for 3 years.<ref>[http://www.ktva.com/topstory/ci_5930449 KTVA: Ramy Brooks Decision]</ref> Interviews of three adult and two child witnesses by an independent investigation team factored into the decision.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}
