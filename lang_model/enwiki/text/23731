'''American Motors Corporation''' ('''AMC''') was an American automobile company formed by the 1954 merger of [[Nash-Kelvinator Corporation]] and [[Hudson Motor Car Company]]. At the time, it was the largest corporate merger in U.S. history.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[George W. Mason]] was the architect of the merger to reap benefits from the strengths of the two firms to battle the much larger "[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]" automakers ([[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Chrysler]]). Within a year [[George W. Romney]] took over, reorganizing the company and focusing AMC's future on a new small car line.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,861782,00.html | title=Gamble on the Rambler |magazine=Time | date=December 19, 1955 |accessdate=February 8, 2011}}</ref> By the end of 1957 the original Nash and Hudson brands were completely phased out. The company struggled at first, but Rambler sales took off. A Rambler won the 1959 [[Mobil Economy Run]] and by 1960, was the third most popular Brand of Automobile in the USA, behind Ford and Chevy. <ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,864627,00.html |title=Autos: Victory for Rambler |journal=Time |date=April 20, 1959 |accessdate=August 31, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1965-1966-rambler-ambassador1.htm| title=1965<U+2013>1966 Rambler Ambassador |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com|date=October 23, 2007 |accessdate=February 8, 2011}}</ref> After two model years, 1963 and 1964 of only producing compact cars, AMC focused back to larger and more profitable car like the Ambassador line  from the perceived negative of the [[Rambler (automobile)|Rambler]]'s [[economy car]] image. In the face of deteriorating financial and market positions, [[Roy D. Chapin, Jr.]], took charge to revitalize the company, and designer [[Richard A. Teague]] economized by developing several vehicles from common stampings.  While prices and costs were cut, new and more sporty automobiles were introduced, and from 1968 AMC became known for the [[AMC Javelin|Javelin]] and [[AMC AMX|AMX]] [[muscle car]]s. 

AMC purchased Kaiser's [[Jeep]] utility vehicle operations in 1970 to complement their existing passenger car business. Beginning in the early 1970s, they moved towards all-new compact car designs based on the [[AMC Hornet|Hornet]], including the Hornet itself and the [[AMC Gremlin|Gremlin]]. Other new models in the 1970s included the [[AMC Matador|Matador]] and [[AMC Pacer|Pacer]]. In an effort to become create a more efficient cost structure, in the 1979 model year, AMC eliminated the Matador line and then in the 1980 model year, eliminated the Pacer, AMC focus almost exclusively on their Hornet-based cars and the Jeep line. While the new lines of the late 1970s, such as the [[AMC Spirit|Spirit]] and [[AMC Concord|Concord]], were variations on the Hornet's [[automobile platform|platform]], the company continued with innovations on existing designs: the 4-wheel-drive [[AMC Eagle]], introduced in 1979, was one of the first true [[Crossover (automobile)|crossovers]].

From 1980, AMC partnered with France's [[Renault]] to help finance their manufacturing operations, obtain much-needed capital, and source subcompact vehicles. By 1983 Renault had a controlling interest in AMC. In the 1983 model year, the AMC brand focused entirely on AWD autos and stopped producing two wheel drive cars.  AMC facilities were used to produce Renault Alliance and Encore compact and subcompact cars. In 1985 Chrysler entered an agreement with AMC to product Dodge Diplomats and Plymouth Fury as well as Dodge Omni's and Plymouth Horizon's in AMC's Kenosha Wisconsin plant.  At the time, AMC had excess manufacturing capacity thus contract manufacturing for Chrysler made sense.  In 1987, after further new vehicle development that included the [[Eagle Medallion|Medallion]] and, by Giorgietto Giugiaro's Italdesign  the new [[full-size car|full-size]] [[front-wheel drive|front-drive]] sedan<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dunne |first=Jim |title=Inside Detroit |journal=Popular Mechanics |year=1986 |month=June |volume=163 |issue=8 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0OMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=code+X58+AMC |page=40 |accessdate=31 May 2012 }}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal|journal=Business Week |date=28 April 1986 |title=Can American Motors shed its sad-sack image? |url=http://books.google.pl/books?id=oUw1AAAAMAAJ&q=A+two-+door+coupe,+the+X-59,+debuts+in+1988&redir_esc=y |accessdate=23 May 2012 }}</ref> that became the [[Eagle Premier]], Renault sold its 47% ownership stake in AMC to [[Chrysler]]. Chrysler made a public offer to purchase all the remaining outstanding shares of AMC stock on the NYSE.  Renault left the USA Market completely as a brand in 1987.  The Renault Medallion was sold thru the newly formed Jeep Eagle Division of Chrysler as an Eagle, not a Renault.  AMC's badge would be used on the Eagle Sports Wagon thru the 1988 model year then be eliminated entirely.   The [[Jeep-Eagle|Jeep/Eagle]] division of Chrysler Corporation was formed from the AMC Jeep Renault dealer network. The [[Jeep]] and [[Eagle (automobile)|Eagle]] vehicles were marketed primarily by former AMC [[Car dealership|dealers]].  Ultimately, the Eagle Brand of car would be phased out like Chrysler's DeSoto, Plymouth and Imperial by 1998.

==Formation==

In January 1954, [[Nash-Kelvinator Corporation]] began acquisition of the [[Hudson Motor Car Company]] (in what was called a [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger]]). The new corporation would be called American Motors Corporation. (An earlier corporation with the same name, co-founded by [[Louis Chevrolet]], had existed in New Jersey from 1916 through 1922 before merging into the Bessemer<U+2013>American Motors Corporation.)

The Nash-Kelvinator/Hudson deal was a straight [[stock transfer]] (three shares of Hudson listed at 11<U+215B>, for two shares of AMC and one share of Nash-Kelvinator listed at 17<U+215C>, for one share of AMC) and finalized in the spring of 1954, forming the fourth-biggest auto company in the U.S. with [[asset]]s of US$355&nbsp;million and more than $100&nbsp;million in [[working capital]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,823270,00.html|title=Answer from the Hustlers|journal=Time|date=January 25, 1954|accessdate=July 12, 2010}}</ref> The new company retained Hudson CEO [[A.E. Barit]] as a consultant and he took a seat on the [[Board of directors|Board of Directors]]. Nash's [[George W. Mason]] became President and CEO.

Mason, the architect of the merger, believed that the survival of the US' remaining independent automakers depended on their joining in one multibrand company capable of challenging the "Big Three" <U+2013> [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]] <U+2013> as an equal. The "frantic 1953<U+2013>54 Ford/GM price war" had a devastating impact on the remaining "independent" automakers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Flammang|first=James M.| title=Chronicle of the American automobile: over 100 years of auto history|year=1994 |publisher=Publications International |isbn=978-0-7853-0778-5|url=http://books.google.com/?id=9Z5TAAAAMAAJ&q=frantic+1953-54+Ford/GM+price+war&dq=frantic+1953-54+Ford/GM+price+war |page=278 |accessdate=July 29, 2010 }}</ref> The reasons for the merger between Nash and Hudson included helping cut costs and strengthen their sales organizations to meet the intense competition expected from autos' Big Three.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,860075,00.html |title=Time Clock, Oct. 12, 1953 |journal=Time |date=October 12, 1953 |accessdate=July 12, 2010}}</ref>

One quick result from the merger was the doubling up with Nash on purchasing and production, allowing Hudson to cut prices an average of $155 on the Wasp line, up to $204 on the more expensive Hornet models.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,823771,00.html|title=Time Clock, Feb. 7, 1955|journal=Time|date=February 7, 1955|accessdate=July 12, 2010}}</ref> After the merger, AMC had its first profitable quarter during the second three months of 1955, earning $1,592,307, compared to a loss of $3,848,667 during the same period in the previous year.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,866588,00.html|title=Second-Best Year|journal=Time|date=August 1, 1955|accessdate=July 12, 2010}}</ref> Mason also entered into informal discussions with [[James J. Nance]] of Packard to outline his [[Strategic planning|strategic vision]]. Interim plans were made for AMC to buy Packard [[Ultramatic]] automatic transmissions and Packard [[V8 engine]]s for certain AMC products.

In 1954, [[Packard Motor Car Company|Packard]] acquired [[Studebaker]].<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,860916,00.html|title=Autos: Merger No. 3|journal=Time|date=June 28, 1954|accessdate=July 12, 2010}}</ref> The new [[Studebaker-Packard Corporation]] (S-P) made the new {{convert|320|CID|L|abbr=on}} Packard V8 engine and Packard's Ultramatic automatic transmission available to AMC for its 1955 [[Nash Ambassador]] and Hudson Hornet models. When Mason died in 1954, [[George W. Romney]] succeeded him. Ironically, Romney had once been offered Nance's job.<ref name= Bonsall>{{cite book|last=Bonsall|first=Thomas E. |title=More Than They Promised: The Studebaker Story|publisher=Stanford University Press|year =2000|page=287|url= http://books.google.com/?id=w67Uhn6bpnsC&pg=PA287&dq=Romney+had+once+offered+Nance's+job+Packard |isbn=978-0-8047-3586-5 |accessdate=November 24, 2010 }}</ref> In 1948, Romney received offers from Packard for the post of chief operating officer and from Nash for the number two position in the company. Although the Packard offer would have paid more, Romney decided to work under Mason because he thought Nash had a brighter future. S-P President James Nance refused to consider merging with AMC unless he could take the top position (Mason and Nance were former competitors as heads of the Kelvinator and [[Hotpoint]], respectively), and a week after Mason's death Romney announced, ''"there are no mergers under way either directly or indirectly."''<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,823618,00.html |title=Personnel: Changes of the Week |journal=Time |date=October 25, 1954 | accessdate=July 12, 2010}}</ref> Romney agreed with Mason's commitment to buy S-P products. Mason and Nance had agreed that in return S-P would endeavor to purchase parts from American Motors, but S-P did not do so. As the Packard engines and transmissions were comparatively expensive, AMC began development of its own [[AMC V8 engine|V8]].<ref name=newentry>{{cite journal|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,819620,00.html|title=Autos: New Entry|journal=Time |date=March 22, 1954|accessdate=July 12, 2010}}</ref> AMC also spent US$40 million developing its Double Safe Single Unit [[monocoque]], which debuted in the 1956 model year.<ref>[http://www.oldcaradvertising.com/AMC%20Ads/1956%20Rambler/1956%20Rambler%20Ad-02.jpg Old Car Advertising] and [http://www.oldcaradvertising.com/AMC%20Ads/1956%20Rambler/1956%20Rambler%20Ad-05.jpg Old Car Advertising].

By 1964, Studebaker production in the United States had ended, and its Canadian operations ceased in 1966. The "Big Three", plus the smaller AMC, [[Kaiser Jeep]], [[International Harvester]], [[Avanti_cars_(non-Studebaker)|Avanti]], and [[Checker Motors Corporation|Checker]] companies were the remaining North American auto manufacturers.

===Product consolidation===
American Motors combined the Nash and Hudson product lines under a common manufacturing strategy in 1955, with the production of Nashes and Hudsons consolidated at Kenosha.<ref name=newentry/> The Detroit Hudson plant was converted to military contract production and eventually sold. The separate Nash and Hudson dealer networks were retained. The Hudsons were redesigned to bring them in harmony with Nash body styles.

The fast-selling Rambler model was sold as both a Nash and a Hudson in 1955 and 1956. These [[Badge engineering|badge-engineered]] Ramblers, along with similar Metropolitans, were identical save for hubcaps, nameplates, and other minor trim details.

The pre-existing full-size Nash product line was continued and the [[Nash Statesman]] and Ambassador were restyled as the "new" [[Hudson Wasp]] and [[Hudson Hornet]]. Although the cars shared the same body shell, they were at least as different from one another as Chevrolet and Pontiac. Hudsons and Nashes each used their own engines as they had previously: the Hudson Hornet continued to offer the {{convert|308|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 that had powered the ([[NASCAR]]) champion during the early 1950s; the Wasp now used the former engine of the Hudson Jet.

The Nash Ambassador and Statesman continued with overhead- valve and L-head sixes respectively. Hudson and Nash cars had different front suspensions. Trunk lids were interchangeable but other body panels, rear window glass, dash panels and braking systems were different. The Hudson Hornet and Wasp, and their Nash counterparts, had improved ride and visibility; also better fuel economy owing to the lighter unitized Nash body.

For the 1958 model year, the Nash and Hudson brands were dropped. [[Rambler (car)|Rambler]] became a marque in its own right and the mainstay of the company. The slow-selling British-built [[Nash Metropolitan]] subcompact continued as a standalone brand until it was dropped after 1962. The prototype 1958 [[Nash Ambassador]] / [[Hudson Hornet]], built on a stretched Rambler platform, was renamed at the last minute as "Ambassador by Rambler". To round out the model line AMC reintroduced the old 1955, {{convert|100|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase [[Nash Rambler]] as the new [[Rambler American]] with only a few modifications. This gave Rambler a compact lineup with {{convert|100|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} American, {{convert|108|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} [[Rambler Six]] and [[Rambler Rebel|Rebel V8]], as well as the {{convert|117|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} Ambassador wheelbase vehicles.

===The "dinosaur-fighter"===
Sales of Ramblers soared in the late 1950s in part because American Motors focus on the compact car and its marketing efforts. These included sponsoring the hugely popular [[Walt Disney anthology television series]] and as an exhibitor at the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California. George Romney himself pitched the Rambler product in the television commercials.

While the "Big Three" introduced ever-larger cars, AMC followed a "dinosaur-fighter" strategy. [[George W. Romney]]'s leadership focused the company on the compact car, a fuel-efficient vehicle 20 years before there was a real need for them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Meyers|first=Gerald C.|year= 1986|title=When it hits the fan: Managing the nine crises of business|publisher=Houghton Mifflin| isbn=978-0-395-41171-1}}</ref> This gave Romney a high profile in the media. Two core [[Critical success factor|strategic factors]] came into play: (1) the use of shared components in AMC products and (2) a refusal to participate in the Big Three's restyling race. This cost-control policy helped Rambler develop a reputation as solid economy cars. Company officials were confident in the changing market and in 1959 announced a $10&nbsp;million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000000|1959}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) expansion of its Kenosha complex (to increase annual straight-time capacity from 300,000 to 440,000 cars).<ref name=rvm15>{{cite journal|url= http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_rearview_mirror_15/index.html|title=Rearview mirror|journal=Ward's AutoWorld|date=February 1, 2000|accessdate=August 31, 2012 }}</ref> A letter to shareholders in 1959 claimed that the introduction of new compact cars by AMC's large domestic competitors (for the 1960 model year) "signals the end of big-car domination in the U.S." and that AMC predicts small-car sales in the U.S. may reach 3 million units by 1963.<ref name=rvm15/>

American Motors was also beginning to experiment in non-gasoline powered automobiles. On April 1, 1959, AMC and Sonotone Corporation announced a joint research effort to consider producing an [[electric car]] that was to be powered by a "self-charging" battery.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_rearview_mirror_13/index.html|title=Rearview Mirror |journal=Ward's AutoWorld|date=April 1, 2000 |accessdate=August 31, 2012 }}</ref> Sonotone had the technology for making sintered plate [[nickel<U+2013>cadmium batteries]] that can be recharged very rapidly and are lighter than a typical automobile [[lead<U+2013>acid battery]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.roger-russell.com/sonopg/sononst.htm|last=Russell|first=Roger|title=Sonotone History: Tubes, Hi-Fi Electronics, Tape heads and Nicad Batteries|publisher=Sonotone Corporation History| accessdate=July 12, 2010}}</ref>

In 1959, AMC hired designer [[Richard A. Teague]] who had previously worked for [[General Motors]], [[Packard]], and [[Chrysler]]; after [[Edmund E. Anderson]] left the company in 1961, Teague was named principal designer and in 1964, Vice President.

==Changing focus in the 1960s==

===Innovation===

[[File:1969 AMX in Big Bad Green umf.jpg|right|thumb|1969 American Motors AMX]]

In an effort to stay competitive, American Motors produced a wide range of products during the 1960s, and added innovations long before the "Big Three" introduced them.

For example, the [[Rambler Classic]] was equipped with a standard tandem [[master cylinder]] in 1962, six years before U.S. safety regulations required that safety feature.

Rambler also was an early pioneer in offering an automatic shift indicator sequence (PRN21L, where if one selected "2", the car started in second gear, while "1" started in first gear) which is similar to today's "PRNODSL", made mandatory in 1968, which requires a neutral position between reverse and drive, while [[General Motors]] still offered a shift selector that had reverse immediately next to low gear (PNDSLR) well into the 1960s.

In 1964, the Classic was equipped with standard dual reclining front seats nearly a decade before the Big Three offered them as options. [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]] [[disc brake]]s were made optional on the Classic in 1965, while the Big Three didn't offer them until 1969 on many models.

In the early part of the decade, sales were strong, thanks in no small part to the company's history of building small cars, which came into vogue in 1961.<ref name="Flory133">{{cite book|last =Flory, Jr.|first=J.

The company became completely debt-free. The financial success allowed the company to reach an agreement on August 26, 1961 with the [[United Auto Workers]] for a [[profit sharing]] plan that was new in the automobile industry.<ref name="stetson">{{cite news|last=Stetson|first=Damon|title=American Motors And U.A.W. Agree To Share Profits|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0C12F7395D1B728DDDAE0A94D0405B818AF1D3&scp=50&sq=American%20Motors%20Corporation&st=cse|accessdate=November 24, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times| date=August 27, 1961|page=1}}</ref> Its new three-year labor contract also included generous annual improvement pay increases, as well as automatic cost-of-living raises.<ref name="stetson"/> However, in 1962, Romney resigned to run for Governor of [[Michigan]]. His replacement was [[Roy Abernethy]], AMC's successful sales executive.

Abernethy believed that AMC's reputation of building reliable economical cars could be translated into a new strategy that could follow AMC buyers as they traded up into larger, more expensive vehicles.  AMC in reality had produced large cars thru most of its history, The Rambler Ambassadors were every bit as large as a Full Sized Ford or Chevy.  There was only and absence of Full Sized cars from AMC line up in 1963 and 1964<ref>{{cite news|last=Jones|first=David R.|title=American Motors Putting Stress on Power and Luxury|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20616F63A5B1B728DDDAE0894D1405B848AF1D3&scp=18&sq=Roy%20Abernethy%20AMC&st=cse|accessdate=August 8, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 7, 1964|page=6}}</ref> The first cars bearing his signature were the 1965 models. These were a longer [[AMC Ambassador|Ambassador]] series and new [[Convertible (car)|convertible]]s for the larger models. During mid-year a [[fastback]], called the [[Rambler Marlin|Marlin]], was added. It competed directly with cars like the Dodge Charger, AMC's "family-sized" car emphasized [[Personal luxury car|personal-luxury]]. Abernethy also called for the de-emphasis of the Rambler brand. The 1966 Marlin and Ambassador lost their Rambler nameplates, and were badged as "American Motors" products. The new models shared fewer parts among each other and were more expensive to build.

===Tough choices===
The continuing quest "in the business world's toughest race <U+2013> the grinding contest against the Big Three automobile makers" also meant annual styling changes requiring large expenditures.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vartan|first=Vartaing G.|title=Rambler Chief Is Fighting 'Big 3'; Roy Abernethy Says American Pushes Hard Battle|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70D1FFD3A5C147A93C2AB1788D85F408685F9|accessdate=August 8, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 20, 1964|page=45}}</ref> American Motors' management total confidence "that the new 1965 models would stem a bothersome decline" actually began falling behind in share of sales.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jones|first=David A.|title=Rambler Facing Eroding Market|url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30616FE3C5A157A93C7AB178CD85F418685F9&scp=16&sq=Roy%20Abernethy%20AMC&st=cse|accessdate=August 8, 2010|newspaper=The new York Times|date=July 25, 1965|page=F1}}</ref> Moreover, a new line of redesigned cars in the [[Full-size car|full]] and [[Mid-size car|mid-sized]] markets was launched in the fall of 1966.<ref>{{cite news|title=American Motors Is Counting on Sleekly Styled Cars|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30C13F63A54157A93C0AB1782D85F428685F9&scp=26&sq=Roy%20Abernethy%20AMC&st=cse|accessdate=August 8, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 22, 1966|page=43}}</ref> The cars won acclaim for their fluid styling, and Abernethy's ideas did work as Ambassador Sales increased significantly.  The dated designs of the Rambler Americans, however, hurt its sales which offset gains from Ambassador sales.  There were quality control problems with the introduction of the new full-sized cars, as well as persistent rumors of the company's demise because of their precarious cash flow.  Consumer Reports negative ratings for AMC's Safety didn't help either.

American Motors did not have their own electric car program as did the Big Three, and after some negotiation a contract was drawn in 1967 with Gulton Industries to develop a new battery based on [[Lithium battery|lithium]] and a speed controller designed by Victor Wouk.<ref name=Wouk>{{cite journal|url=http://pr.caltech.edu/periodicals/EandS/articles/LXVII3/Wouk%20Feature.pdf |last= Goodstein |first=Judith |year=2004 |title=Godfather of the Hybrid |journal=Engineering & Science| publisher=California Institute of Technology|volume=LXVII|issue=3 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100605145302/http://pr.caltech.edu/periodicals/EandS/articles/LXVII3/Wouk%20Feature.pdf| archivedate=June 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref> A nickel-cadmium battery powered 1969 Rambler station wagon demonstrated the power systems that according to the scientist was a "wonderful car".<ref name=Wouk/> This was also the start of other "plug-in"-type experimental AMC vehicles developed with Gulton <U+2013> the [[Amitron]] and the [[Electron (vehicle)|Electron]].

Abernethy was ousted from AMC on January 9, 1967 and damage control fell to the new CEO, [[Roy D. Chapin, Jr.|Roy D. Chapin Jr.]] (son of Hudson Motors founder [[Roy D. Chapin]]).<ref>{{cite news| title=American Motors Picks Chapin For Chief as 2 Men Step Down; Evans and Abernethy Drop Out of Management Team Luneburg Is President|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00712F93554117B93C2A8178AD85F438685F9&scp=1&sq=Roy%20Abernethy%20AMC&st=cse|accessdate=August 8, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 10, 1967|page=53 }}</ref> Chapin quickly instituted changes to AMC's offerings and tried to regain market share by focusing on younger demographic markets.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hofmann|first=Paul|title=A Younger Management At Rambler Maker; Rambler Maker Accenting Youth|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40912FE3B5F137A93C3A8178AD85F438685F9&scp=27&sq=Roy%20Abernethy%20AMC&st=cse|accessdate=August 8, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 11, 1967|page=65}}</ref> Chapin's first decision was to cut the price of the Rambler to within US$200 of the basic [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. Innovative marketing ideas included making [[air conditioning]] standard on all 1968 Ambassador models (available as a delete option). This made AMC the first U.S. automaker to make air conditioning standard equipment on a line of cars, preceding even luxury makes such as [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]], [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]], and [[Cadillac]].

The company introduced exciting entries for the decade's [[muscle car]] boom, most notably the [[AMC AMX|AMX]], while the [[AMC Javelin|Javelin]] served as the company's entrant into the sporty "pony car" market created by the [[Ford Mustang]]. Additional operating cash was derived in 1968 through the sale of [[Kelvinator]] Appliance, once one of the firm's core operating units.

The Rambler brand was completely dropped after the 1969 model year in North America, although it continued to be used in several overseas markets as either a model or brand name, with the last use in [[Mexico]] in 1983. From 1970, AMC was the brand used for all American Motors passenger cars; and all vehicles from that date bore the AMC name and the new corporate logo. However, the names American Motors and AMC were used interchangeably in corporate literature well into the 1980s. The branding issue was further complicated when the company's [[AMC Eagle|Eagle]] [[four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]] passenger cars were marketed as the American Eagle in the 1980s.

Chapin expanded American Motors product line in 1970 through the purchase of the Kaiser-Jeep Corporation (formerly [[Willys|Willys-Overland]]) from [[Henry J. Kaiser|Kaiser Industries]]. This added the iconic [[Jeep]] brand of light trucks and SUVs, as well as Kaiser-Jeep's lucrative government contracts <U+2013> notably the [[M151 MUTT]] line of military Jeeps and the DJ-Series [[United States Postal Service|postal]] Jeeps. AMC also expanded their international network. The military and special products business was reconstituted as American Motors General Products Division, later reorganized as [[AM General]].

In 1970, AMC consolidated all passenger cars under one distinct brand identity and debuted the [[AMC Hornet|Hornet]] range of compact cars.

The Hornet and the later [[AMC Gremlin|Gremlin]] shared [[Automobile platform|platforms]]. The Gremlin, the first North American-built subcompact, sold more than 670,000 units from 1970<U+2013>1978. The Hornet became AMC's best-selling passenger car since the Rambler Classic, with more than 860,000 units sold by the time production ended in 1977.

The new mid-sized [[AMC Matador]] replaced the Rebel in 1971, using an advertising campaign that asked, "What's a Matador?"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.javelinamx.com/JavHome/articles/matx-rt.htm the article |title=Road Test: American Motors Matador X from ''Road & Track'' |month=March |year=1974 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080511184149/http://www.javelinamx.com/JavHome/articles/matx-rt.htm |archivedate=May 11, 2008 |accessdate=August 31, 2012 }}</ref> In 1972, AMC won the tender for [[Los Angeles Police Department]] cruisers, and Matadors were used by the department from 1972 to 1975, replacing the [[Plymouth Satellite]]. American Motors supplied [[Mark VII Limited]] owner [[Jack Webb]] with two Matadors for use in his popular television series ''[[Adam-12]]'', increasing the cars' public profile.

In 1973, AMC signed a licensing agreement with [[Curtiss-Wright]] to build [[Wankel engine]]s for cars and Jeeps.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_rearview_mirror_15/|author=Ward's Auto World Staff|title=Rearview mirror|journal=Ward's Auto World|date=February 1, 2000 |accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref>

Starting in 1974, the Matador sedan and station wagon were mildly refreshed, with new boxier front ends. The Matador two-door hardtop, known as the "flying brick" due to its poor aerodynamics in [[NASCAR]] competition, was replaced at great cost with a sleek, smoothly shaped, and radically styled two-door coupe. The model received praise for its design, including "Best Styled Car of 1974" by ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1974-1978-amc-matador1.htm|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide''|title=1974<U+2013>1978 AMC Matador|date=October 26, 2007|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}</ref> customer satisfaction,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lamm|first=Michael|title=Styling is a knockout, but so is the low roofline!|journal=Popular Mechanics|month=April|year=1974|volume=141|issue=4|pages=98<U+2013>101|url= http://books.google.com/?id=odQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA98&dq=Matador+styling+is+a+knockout|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}</ref> and sold almost 100,000 coupes over a five-year period.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bond|first=Craig|title=Matador Coupe History 1974<U+2013>1978|url=http://www.matadorcoupe.com/history.htm|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}</ref> The Matador Coupe shared few components with the Matador sedan and station wagon other than suspension, drive train, some trim, and interior parts.

The Ambassador was redesigned and stretched {{convert|7|in|mm|0}} to become the biggest ever, just as the 1973 [[1973 oil crisis|Arab Oil Embargo]] sparked gasoline rationing across the nation. The additional length was due to a new front end design and stronger energy absorbing bumpers required of all automobiles sold in the U.S.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Norbye|first=Jan P.|title=New bumpers have uniform height, take angle impacts|journal=Popular Science|pages=90<U+2013>91|month=October|year=1973|url= http://books.google.com/?id=lpiMSzja6W4C&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=New+bumpers+have+uniform+Ambassador|volume=203|issue=4|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}</ref> Sales of all large cars fell due to economic problems and rising gasoline prices. The full-sized Ambassador was discontinued as AMC's flagship line after the 1974 model year. Nash and AMC made Ambassadors from 1927 to 1974, the longest use of the same model name for any AMC product and, at the time, the longest continuously used nameplate in the industry.

In 1974, AMC's AM General subsidiary began building urban transit buses in cooperation with [[New Flyer Industries|Flyer Industries]] of [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba. The ''Metropolitan'' coach had sold 5,212 units when production ceased in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omot.org/roster/buses/amg.html|title=Coach Manufacturer History <U+2013> AM General|publisher=Ohio Museum of Transportation|date=August 13, 2004|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}</ref>

The [[AMC Pacer]], an innovative all-new model introduced in March 1975 and billed as "the first wide small car", was a subcompact designed to provide the comfort of a full-sized car. Its pre-production development coincided with two changes in U.S. Federal passenger auto laws: first, the reduction in permissible [[Automobile emissions control|emissions]] for passenger auto engines, which the Pacer would have met with the [[Wankel engine|Wankel]]-type engine it was designed for, as the Wankel's compact dimensions allowed space for extensive emission control equipment in the engine bay; second, a tightening of U.S. passenger [[Car safety|auto safety]] laws, which accounted for the Pacer's designed-in safety features, e.g. internal door beams. These, together with the wide body and large glass area, added considerable weight.

With the advent of the [[Arab Oil Embargo]] of 1973, [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] aborted the [[Wankel rotary engine]] around which the Pacer had been designed, as its fuel consumption exceeded that of conventional engines with similar power. Therefore AMC's existing {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC Straight-6 engine]]s were used in the Pacer instead. Fuel economy was better than a rotary, but still relatively poor in light of the new focus on energy efficiency. Also, as the Pacer shared few components other than drivetrain with other AMC cars, it was expensive to make and the cost increased when sales fell steeply after the first two years.

Development and production costs for the Pacer and Matador Coupe drained capital which might otherwise have been invested in updating the more popular Hornet and Gremlin lines, so that toward the end of the 1970s the company faced the growing energy crisis with aged products that were uncompetitive in hotly contested markets. However, "AMC used cars, as far back as 1967, had the advantage of good warranty coverage ... so most owners were conscious of low-cost car maintenance ... AMC units [became] some of the very best buys on the used car market" by 1975.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Buying a Used Car|journal=Kiplinger's Personal Finance|year=1975|month=January|volume=29|issue=1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4wMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=AMC+used+cars,+as+far+back+as+1967,+had+the+advantage+of+good+warranty+coverage+that+%22didn't+cost+the+owner+his+right+arm,%22+so+most+owners+were+conscious+of+low-cost+car+maintenance|accessdate=January 16, 2011|page=27|author1=Kiplinger Washington Editors, Inc}}</ref>

The 1977 Gremlin had redesigned headlights, grille, rear hatch and fascia. For economy in the fuel crisis, AMC offered the car with a more fuel-efficient [[Volkswagen]]-designed [[Audi]] 4-cylinder engine {{convert|2.0|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}}. The engine was expensive for AMC to build and the Gremlin retained the less costly but also less economical {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} as standard equipment.

The [[AMC AMX|AMX]] nameplate was revived in 1977. It was a sporty appearance package on the [[AMC Hornet|Hornet]] [[hatchback]] featuring upgrades, as well as the {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} inline six as standard with a choice of three-speed automatic or four-speed manual transmissions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dunne|first=Jim|title=AMC for '77|journal=Popular Science|year=1976|month=October|volume=209|issue=4|pages=129, 184|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HwEAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=AMC+for+'77+Popular+Science|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}</ref> The {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine#304|V8 engine]] was optional with the automatic transmission.

As all Matadors now received standard equipment that was formerly optional (e.g. power steering, automatic transmission), the "Brougham" package was dropped. Optional on the Matador coupe was a landau vinyl roof with opera windows, and top-line Barcelonas offered new two-tone paint.

For 1978, the Hornet [[automobile platform|platform]] was redesigned with an adaptation of the new Gremlin front-end design and renamed [[AMC Concord]]. AMC targeted it at the emerging "premium compact" market segment, paying particular attention to ride and handling, standard equipment, trim, and interior luxury.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ceppos|first=Rich|title=AMC for '78 <U+2013> a V-8 for the Pacer, and now there's Concord|journal=Popular Science|page=98|month=October|year=1977|volume=211|issue=4|url =http://books.google.com/books?id=bQEAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA98&dq=AMC+Concord |accessdate=January 16, 2011}}</ref>

Gremlins borrowed the Concord instrument panel, as well as a Hornet AMX-inspired GT sports appearance package and a new striping treatment for X models.

The AMC Pacer hood was modified to clear a V8 engine, and a Sports package replaced the former X package. With falling sales of Matador Coupes, sedans and wagons, their {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine was dropped, leaving only the {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Inline-6 (standard on coupes and sedans) and the {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 (optional on coupes and sedans, standard on wagons). The two-tone Barcelona luxury package was offered on Matador sedans, and two-tone red paint introduced as an additional Barcelona option. Matador production ceased at the end of the model year with total sales of 10,576 units. The Matador was no longer attractive as automakers struggled to overcome economic woes including continuing fuel price increases and double digit domestic inflation.<ref>{{cite web|first= Thomas J.|last=Sugrue|title=From Motor City to Motor Metropolis: How the Automobile Industry Reshaped Urban America|url=http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Race/R_Overview/R_Overview5.htm|publisher=Automobile in American Life and Society|year=2004|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}</ref>

In 1979, the [[AMC Spirit|Spirit]] sedan replaced the Gremlin. A new fastback version of the car, the Spirit [[Liftback]], proved successful.

In December, Pacer production ceased after a small run of 1980 models was built to use up parts stock.

Concords received a new front end treatment, and in their final season, hatchbacks became available in DL trim. On May 1, 1979, AMC marked the 25th anniversary of the Nash-Hudson merger with "Silver Anniversary" editions of the AMC Concord and Jeep CJ in two-tone silver (Jeeps then accounted for around 50 percent of the company's sales and most of their profits); and introduced LeCar, a U.S. version of the small, fuel-efficient [[Renault 5]], in dealer showrooms.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948087,00.html|title=AMC Liaison|journal=Time|date=April 10, 1978|accessdate=July 29, 2010}}</ref>

Concord and Spirit models were dropped after 1983.

In February 1977, ''Time'' magazine reported that although AMC had lost $73.8&nbsp;million in the previous two fiscal years, U.S. banks had agreed to a year's extension for a $72.5&nbsp;million credit that had expired in January; that Stockholders had received no dividends since 1974; and that Pacer sales did not match expectations.

Also in 1977, [[Gerald C. Meyers]] was appointed chairman and chief executive.

On March 31, 1978, AMC and Renault announced a sweeping agreement for the joint manufacture and distribution of cars and trucks that would achieve benefits for both.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stuart| first=Reginald|title=Joint Manufacture Planned In Accord By A.M.C., Renault; Distribution Also Covered|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0916FE3F5513728DDDA80894DC405B888BF1D3&scp=67&sq=American%20Motors%20Corporation&st=cse|accessdate=August 9, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times| date=April 1, 1978|page=27}}</ref> A month later, AMC announced that it would halt the production of standard urban [[transit bus]]es after about 4,300 were sold by its AM General subsidiary during three years.<ref>{{cite news|title=A.M.C. to Halt Building Standard Transit Buses|url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70814FC385513728DDDA80894DE405B888BF1D3&scp=66&sq=American%20Motors%20Corporation&st=cse|accessdate=August 9, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times| date=June 1, 1978|page=D4}}</ref> In May 1978, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ordered the recall of all AMC's 1976 cars (except those conforming to California emissions regulations) <U+2013> some 270,000 vehicles<U+2014> plus 40,000 1975 and 1976 Jeeps and mini trucks, for correction of a fault in the pollution control system.

American Motors lost an estimated $65&nbsp;million on its conventional (non-Jeep) cars for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1978, but strong Jeep sales helped the company to an overall $36.7&nbsp;million profit on sales of $2.6&nbsp;billion. However, AMC faced costly engineering work to bring their Jeeps into compliance with a federal directive for all 4-wheel-drive vehicles to average {{convert|15|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} by 1981.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916539,00.html|title=Money Machine|journal=Time|date=December 18, 1978 |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}</ref>

A year later, with its share of the American market at 1.83%, the company struck a deal with Renault, the nationally owned French automaker. AMC would receive a $150&nbsp;million cash injection, $50&nbsp;million in credits, and also the rights to start building the [[Renault 5]] in 1982.<ref name=accent>{{Cite document|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947525,00.html| title=French Accent|journal=Time|date=October 22, 1979|accessdate=July 29, 2010}}</ref> (A deal for Renault products to be sold through the AMC-Jeep dealer network had already been made in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.amxfiles.com/amc/part5.html AMX files |title=Endgame: Renault and Jeep |publisher=AMX-files |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090525103845/http://www.amxfiles.com/amc/part5.html |archivedate=May 25, 2009 |accessdate=August 31, 2012 }}</ref>) In return, Renault acquired a 22.5% interest in AMC.<ref name=accent/> This was not the first time the two companies had worked together.

In 1979, AMC announced a record $83.9&nbsp;million profit on sales of $3.1&nbsp;billion (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3100000000|1979}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for the fiscal year ending in September<U+2014>this despite an economic downturn, soaring energy prices, rising American unemployment, automobile plants shutting down, and an American market trend towards imported cars. In October, the company's car sales surged 37%, while they sank 21% for the industry as a whole.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948805,00.html|title=AMC's Charge|journal=Time|date=November 19, 1979|accessdate=July 29, 2010}}</ref>

However, a drop in Jeep sales caused by the declining economy and soaring energy prices began to constrict AMC's cash flow. At the same time, pressure increased on the company's non-Jeep product lines. The face-lifts and rebranding of AMC's once-innovative and successful cars were not enough in a competitive landscape that had changed dramatically. No longer was the threat limited to the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] automakers ([[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Chrysler]]). The Japanese used streamlined production methods such as outsourcing and [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] (JIT) supply-chain management. They had new, highly efficient assembly plants in the United States. And now they targeted the heart of AMC's passenger product line: small cars.

While Americans turned to the new imports in increasing numbers, AMC continued its struggle at the inefficient and aging [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] facilities<U+2014>the oldest continuously operating automobile plant in the world, where components and unfinished bodies still had to be transported across the city.

In early 1980, the banks refused AMC further credit. Lacking both capital and resources for the new, truly modern products it needed to offer, the company turned to Renault for a $90&nbsp;million loan (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|90000000|1980}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924408-8,00.html|title=Detroit's Uphill Battle|journal=Time|date=September 8, 1980| accessdate=July 29, 2010|first=Alexander|last=Taylor|first2=Christopher|last2=Redman|first3=Barrett| last3=Seaman}}</ref> By September that year, AMC's U.S. market share had fallen to 1.7%, and in November sales dropped 19.1%.

In January 1982 the company's former president W. Paul Tippett Jr. replaced Gerald C. Meyers as CEO, and Jose Dedeurwaerder, a Renault executive, became president. Dedeurwaerder brought a broad perspective at this critical time: as an engineer and international business executive with 23 years at Renault, he is credited with streamlining many of AMC's arcane management techniques. He also instituted important improvements in plant layouts, as well as in cost and quality control.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Derdak|editor-first=Thomas|title=International Directory of Company History, Volume 1|publisher=St. James Press|year=1988|page=136|isbn=978-0-912289-10-6}}</ref>

Renault, having increased their stake in the company several times to keep it solvent, eventually owned 49% in 1983. This development effectively ended AMC's run as a truly American car company.

New ownership and new management heralded a new product venture for AMC: a line of modern [[front-wheel drive]] cars, designed by Renault, to be produced at Kenosha.

==1980s product developments==

===AMC Eagle===
[[File:AMC Eagle wagon.jpg|right|thumb|1981 AMC Eagle Wagon.]]
In August 1979, for the 1980 model year, AMC introduced four-wheel drive versions of the [[AMC Spirit|Spirit]] and [[AMC Concord|Concord]], calling the collective line the [[AMC Eagle]]. Eagles rapidly became one of the company's best-known products and is considered one of the first "[[crossover SUV]]s". Eagles used the 2-wheel drive body shells mounted on an all-new platform developed by American Motors in the late 1970s. Featuring an innovative full-time four-wheel drive system, it sold best in snow-prone areas. Sales started strongly but declined over time. While the two-wheel drive Spirit and Concord were both discontinued after 1983 as the company concentrated on its new [[Renault Alliance]], the Eagle survived for five years longer, albeit only in station wagon form, into the 1988 model year. This meant the four-wheel drive Eagle was the lone representative of the AMC brand from 1984<U+2013>1988. All the company's remaining output was branded Renault or Jeep. The last AMC Eagle was built on December 14, 1987.

===Renault Alliance===
[[File:Renault alliance.jpg|thumb|right|Later Alliance model with AMC badging in place of Renault]]
The Renault Alliance was the first joint product of the AMC-Renault partnership. Introduced in 1983, the Alliance was a front-wheel drive [[Renault 9 & 11|Renault 9]] compact restyled for the American market by [[Richard Teague]] and produced by AMC at Kenosha. The car was initially badged as a Renault, and some cars carried both Renault ''and'' AMC badges, however most 1986 and all 1987 models had only AMC branding; it was available as a sedan with two or four doors, a [[hatchback]] (introduced in 1984 and badged as [[Renault 9/11|Encore]]), a two-door convertible and, for the final 1987 model year, a higher-performance version of the 2-door sedan and convertible sold as the [[Renault GTA|GTA]].

The new model, introduced at a time of increased interest in small cars, won several awards including [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]]. ''Motor Trend'' declared: "The Alliance may well be the best-assembled first-year car we<U+2019>ve ever seen. Way to go Renault!" The Alliance was listed as number one on ''[[Car and Driver]]'s'' list of [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best cars]] for 1983,<ref>{{cite journal|title=1983 10 Best Cars: AMC/Renault Alliance <U+2013> An Alliance Builds an Alliance|journal=Car and Driver|month=January|year=1983|volume=28|issue=7| url =http://www.caranddriver.com/features/archive/1983_10best_cars-10best_cars/an_alliance_builds_an_alliance_page_2 |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}</ref> The positive reception and sales of 200,000 Alliances by 1984 was hindered by the availability of only two body styles.<ref name="foreign">{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Geoffrey|first2=Lina|last2=G<U+00E1>lvez-Mu<U+00F1>oz|title=Foreign multinationals in the United States: management and performance | chapter=6|year=2001|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-25055-9|pages=110<U+2013>112|url=http://books.google.com/?id=AnsvkPyJPiAC&pg=PA110&dq=Renault+Alliance|accessdate=November 24, 2010}}</ref> The Alliance was a European-designed car and not fully suited to U.S. market demands.<ref name="foreign"/> The distribution network was also not well supported, which led to lower quality delivered by dealerships with "disastrous consequences" for the image of the automobiles, as well as high warranty costs.<ref name="foreign"/> Alliance production ended in June 1987.

===Jeeps===
[[File:Jeep Cherokee XJ 4D Laredo burgundy SOP rr.jpg|thumb|right|Jeep Cherokee Laredo]]
[[File:Jeep Comanche Pioneer white MD r.jpg|thumb|right|Jeep Comanche Pioneer]]
More beneficial to AMC's future was the introduction of an all-new line of compact [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] and [[Jeep Wagoneer|Wagoneer]] models in the autumn of 1983 for the 1984 model year. The popularity of these downsized Jeeps pioneered a new market segment for what later became defined as the [[sport utility vehicle]] (SUV). They initially used the AMC 150 C.I.D. (2.5L) [[AMC Straight-4 engine|OHV four-cylinder engine]] with a [[carburetor]], and a General Motors-built {{convert|2.8|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}} carbureted V6 was optional. In 1986, throttle-body injection replaced the carburetor on the 2.5&nbsp;L I4 engines. A Renault {{convert|2.1|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}} Turbo-Diesel I4 [[Diesel engine|diesel]] was also offered. Starting with the 1987 models, a {{convert|4.0|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}} I6 engine, derived from the older {{convert|258|CID|L|abbr=on}} I6 with a new head design and an electronic [[fuel injection]] system, replaced the [[Outsourcing|outsourced]] V6. American Motors' "new" engine was designed with help from Renault and incorporated Renault-Bendix ([[Renix]]) parts for fuel and ignition management. The 4.0 developed an outstanding reputation for reliability and toughness. Retained by Chrysler after the buyout, the design continued to be improved and refined until its discontinuation at the end of the 2006 model year. The 4.0 engine saw extensive application in XJ Cherokees and Wagoneers, Grand Cherokees, and Wranglers, and many of those engines saw (or are seeing) extremely long lives, quite a few exceeding {{convert|300000|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The XJ Cherokee itself was built by Chrysler until the end of the 2001 model year in the U.S. and until 2005 in China.

Three other designs continued to be used after the Chrysler buyout: the Grand Wagoneer full-size luxury SUV, the full-sized J-series pickups, built on the same chassis as the earlier SJ model Wagoneers and Cherokees that dated from 1963 with the AMC {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, and the [[Jeep Comanche]] (MJ) compact pickup, which debuted in 1986. Unlike most sport-utility vehicles which are based on adapted pickup truck designs, the Cherokee XJ SUV came first and the Comanche was designed as a later pickup truck version.

Production of the full-sized pickups ceased after 1987. The Grand Wagoneer and 360 V8 engine were dropped after 1991 (the last American-made vehicle whose engine used a [[carburetor]] for fuel delivery), and the Comanche bowed after 1992.

==1985 and the final buyout==

===Marketplace and management changes===
There were significant changes in 1985 as the market moved away from AMC's small models. With fuel relatively cheap again, buyers turned to larger more powerful automobiles and AMC was unprepared for this development. Even the venerable Jeep CJ-5 was dropped after a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' TV news magazine expos<U+00E9> of rollover tendencies under extreme conditions. AMC also confronted an angry work force. Labor was taking revenge, and reports circulated about sabotage of vehicles on the assembly lines because of the failure to receive promised wage increases. There were rumors that the aging Kenosha plant was to be shut down. At the same time, Chrysler was having trouble meeting demand for its M-body rear-drive models ([[Dodge Diplomat]], [[Plymouth Gran Fury]] and [[Chrysler Fifth Avenue]]). Because they were assembled using the old "gate and buck system" and the tooling could be easily moved, Chrysler could supply the components and control the quality, while AMC assembled the car. Therefore, Lee Iacocca and Joe Cappy reached an agreement to use some of AMC's idle plant capacity in Kenosha.<ref name="sharf">{{cite journal |url=http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_lee_iacocca_knew/index.html |last=Sharf |first=Stephan |title=Lee Iacocca as I knew him; he was certainly the right man at the right time.. |journal=Ward's AutoWorld |date=May 1, 1996 |accessdate=August 31, 2012 }}</ref>

These problems came in the midst of a transfer of power at AMC from Paul Tippet to a French executive, Pierre Semerena. The new management responded with tactical moves by selling the lawn care [[Wheel Horse]] Products Division and signing an agreement to build Jeeps in the People's Republic of China. [[The Pentagon]] had problems with [[AM General]], a significant [[defense contractor]], being managed by a partially French-government-owned firm. The U.S. government would not allow a foreign government to own a significant portion of an important defense supplier.<ref>{{cite book|last=Olsen, Barney Olsen, Joseph Cabadas|first=Byron|title=The American Auto Factory|year=2002|publisher=MotorBooks International|isbn=978-0-7603-1059-5|url=http://books.google.com/?id=iZJzb91qsE4C&pg=PA127&dq=the+Pentagon+didn't+want+a+French-+controlled+company+making+American+military+equipment|accessdate=November 24, 2010|page=127}}</ref> As a result, the profitable AM General Division was sold. Another milestone was the departure of [[Richard A. Teague|Dick Teague]]: AMC's design vice president for 26 years, he was responsible for many Jeep and AMC designs including the Rambler American, Javelin, Hornet, Gremlin, Pacer, and Matador coupe.

===Problems at Renault and the assassination===
American Motors' major stockholder, Renault, itself was experiencing financial troubles of its own in France. The investment in AMC (including construction of a new Canadian assembly plant in [[Brampton]], Ontario) forced cuts at home, resulting in the closure of several French plants and mass [[layoff]]s. Renault was down to just three alternatives regarding its American holdings: (1) They could declare AMC officially bankrupt thereby lose its investment; (2) They could come up with more money, but Renault management perceived AMC as a bottomless pit; or (3) AMC could be put up for sale and the French could get back part of their investment. Against these detractions, Renault's chairman, [[Georges Besse]], continued to champion the French firm's future in the North American market; pointing to the company's completion of the newest and most-advanced automotive assembly plant in North America, then known as [[Brampton Assembly|Bramalea Assembly]], as well as the recent introduction of the thoroughly modern, fuel-injected 4.0&nbsp;L and 2.5&nbsp;L engines. In addition, Jeep vehicles were riding an unprecedented surge in demand. It seemed to Besse and others that AMC was on course for profitability.

However, on November 17, 1986, [[Georges Besse]], who had a high profile among French capitalists, was assassinated by [[Action directe (armed group)|Action Directe]], a clandestine militant extremist group variously described as communist, anarchist and Maoist,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/164838/Direct-Action |work=Enyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica |title=Direct Action |publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online | accessdate=November 24, 2010 }}</ref> which professed strong sympathies for the [[proletariat]] and the aspirations of the [[Third World]]. The murder was carried out by members of Action Directe's Pierre Overney Commando (named after a Maoist militant killed by a Renault factory guard).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://urbanguerilla.org/actiondirecte/index.html  | publisher=Urban Guerilla |title=Action Directe (Archived 4&nbsp;June&nbsp;2008) |accessdate=November 24, 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080604161024/http://urbanguerilla.org/actiondirecte/index.html |archivedate = June 4, 2008}}</ref> The group stated that the murder was in retaliation for Besse having sacked tens of thousands of workers <U+2013> 34,000 from the French [[aluminium|aluminum]] producer PUK-P<U+00E9>chiney<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.sea-us.org.au/gulliver/puk.html |publisher=Sea-us |title=The Gulliver PUK (Pechiney-Ugine-Kuhlmann) Dossier|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081121120052/http://www.sea-us.org.au/gulliver/puk.html |archivedate=November 21, 2008 |accessdate=August 31, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webcitation.org/5kn90Uqk5 |publisher=ABC-GENT files |title=Short Collective Biography (of) Action Directe Prisoners (Archived) |accessdate=November 24, 2010 }}</ref> and 25,000 from Renault.

===Chrysler purchase AMC Stock===
Under pressure from Renault executives following Besse's death, Renault's new president, Raymond Levy set out to repair employee relations and [[Divestment|divest]] the company of its investment in American Motors.  Renault owned 46.1% of AMC's outstanding shares of Stock.

The earlier arrangement between Chrysler and AMC in 1985, under which AMC would produce [[Chrysler M platform|M-body chassis]] rear-drive large cars for two years from 1986<U+2013>88, fed the rumor that Chrysler was about to buy AMC. According to the head of manufacturing for Chrysler at the time, Stephan Sharf, the existing relationship with AMC producing a car for a competitor facilitated the negotiations.<ref name="sharf"/>

[[File:1st Jeep Grand Cherokee .jpg|thumb|The [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] was the driving force behind Chrysler's buyout of AMC; Lee Iacocca wanted the design. Chrysler completed development and released it to the public in late 1992, and continues to use the nameplate today.]]

On March 9, 1987, Chrysler agreed to buy Renault's share in AMC, plus all the remaining shares, for about US$1.5&nbsp;billion (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1500000000|1987}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).<ref name="holusha">{{cite news|last=Holusha|first=John|title=Chrysler is Buying American Motors; Cost is $1.5&nbsp;billion|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/10/business/chrysler-is-buying-american-motors-cost-is-1.5-billion.html?scp=1&sq=American%20Motors%20Corporation&st=cse|accessdate=August 7, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times| date=March 10, 1987}}</ref> AMC became the [[Jeep-Eagle]] division of Chrysler. It was the Jeep brand that Chrysler CEO [[Lee Iacocca]] really wanted <U+2013> in particular the ZJ [[Jeep Grand Cherokee|Grand Cherokee]], then under development by Jeep engineers, which ultimately proved highly profitable for Chrysler (the nameplate remains in production today). However, the buyout included other attractive deal sweeteners for Chrysler. Among them was the world-class, brand-new manufacturing plant in [[Bramalea, Ontario]], which offered Iacocca an unprecedented opportunity to increase his company's [[Capacity utilization|production capacity]] at a fire-sale price. AMC had designed and built the plant in anticipation of building the [[Renault 25]] based [[Eagle Premier]]. Additional profitable acquisitions were the AMC dealer network (the addition of which strengthened Chrysler's retail distribution <U+2013> many AMC dealers switched to selling Chrysler products); and AMC's underrated organization and management talent <U+2013> which Chrysler quickly assimilated (numerous leading Chrysler engineers and executives were ex-AMC).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_daimlerchrysler_ifs/index.html|title=DaimlerChrysler: The 'What Ifs?' |journal=Ward's AutoWorld |date=June 1, 1998 |accessdate=August 31, 2012 }}</ref>

Ironically the sale came at a time when the automotive press was enthusiastic about the proposed 1988 lineup of Renault and Jeep vehicles, and reports that the financial outlook for the tiny automaker were improving.<ref name="holusha"/>

The sale marked [[Renault]]'s withdrawal from the North American market (excluding [[Mexico]]) in the 1988 model year. However, the French company has since returned to that market with its subsequent purchase of a US$5.4&nbsp;billion controlling stake in [[Nissan]] in March 1999.<ref>{{cite book|last=Morosini|first= Piero|title=The Common Glue|year=2005|publisher=Emerald Group|isbn=978-0-08-044610-3|url= http://books.google.com/?id=JQ3opL7DeT0C&pg=PA209&dq=Renault+returns+to+US+via+Nissan&q|accessdate=August 7, 2010|page=209}}</ref> In contrast to the AMC/Renault partnership, [[Carlos Ghosn]], CEO and President of Renault of France and Nissan of Japan, is guiding the Renault-Nissan alliance away from national identities.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Diem|first=William| title=Ghosn Steering Renault-Nissan Alliance Away From National Identities|journal=Ward's AutoWorld |date=July 29, 2010}}</ref>

==Business legacy==
American Motors was forced to constantly innovate for 33 years until Chrysler absorbed it in 1987. The lessons learned from this experience were integrated into the company that bought AMC. The organization, strategies, as well as several key executives allowed Chrysler to gain an edge on the competition. Even today, the lessons gained from the AMC experience continue to provide benefits to other firms in the industry. There are a number of legacies from AMC's [[Strategic management|business strategies]].

AMC had an ability to formulate strategies that were often evaluated by industry critics as "strokes of brilliance".<ref name=Higgins>{{cite news|last=Higgins |first=James V.|title=Roy Chapin Jr. mastered how to survive in auto industry |newspaper=The Detroit News |date=August 12, 2001 }}</ref> According to [[Roy D. Chapin Jr.]], AMC realized they were up against the giants of the industry, so to compete successfully they had to be able to move quickly and with ingenuity.<ref name=Higgins/> An essential strategy practiced by AMC was to rely on [[Outsourcing|outside vendors]] to supply components in which they had [[Sustainable competitive advantage|differential advantages]]. This approach was finally accepted within the U.S. [[auto industry]], but only after each of the Big Three experienced the failure of attempting to be self-sufficient.

The smallest domestic automaker did not have "the massive R&D budgets of General Motors, Ford, and foreign competitors ... [thus] AMC placed R&D emphasis on bolstering the product life cycle of its prime products (particularly Jeeps)."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MpAoAQAAMAAJ&q=Faced+with+the+massive+R%26D+budgets+of+General+Motors,+Ford,+and+foreign+competitors,+AMC+has+placed+R%26D+emphasis+on+bolstering+the+product+life+cycle+of+its+prime+products+(particularly+Jeeps) |title=Formulation, implementation, and control of competitive strategy |first=John A. |last=Pearce |first2= Richard B. |last2=Robinson |edition=4 |publisher=Irwin |year=1991 |page=315 |isbn=978-0-256-08324-8 |accessdate=March 10, 2012 }}</ref> In 1985, AMC originated [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM) as a strategic business approach according to Sidney Hill, Jr., executive editor for ''Manufacturing Business Technology'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deskeng.com/virtual_desktop/?p=536 |first=Kenneth |last=Wong |title=What PLM Can Learn from Social Media |date=July 29, 2009 |accessdate=March 10, 2012 }}</ref> in an effort to better compete against its much larger rivals by ramping up its product development process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.org/coldfusion/newsnet/may03/technology.cfm |first=Sidney |last=Hill, Jr. |title=How To Be A Trendsetter: Dassault and IBM PLM Customers Swap Tales From The PLM Front |month=May |year=2003 |publisher=COE newsnet |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090213042744/http://www.coe.org/coldfusion/newsnet/may03/technology.cfm |archivedate=February 13, 2009|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}</ref>

Another example of AMC's agility was the ability of management to squeeze money out of reluctant bankers, even in the face of bankruptcy. These [[Core competency|core abilities]] helped save the company from collapse and after each obstacle, give it the wherewithal to keep it operating. Ironically, AMC was never stronger than just before its demise.<ref name=Higgins/>

AMC's managers anticipated important trends in the automotive industry.<ref>{{cite book|last= Lawrence|first=Mike|title=A to Z of Sports Cars, 1945<U+2013>1990|publisher=MotorBooks/MBI|year=1996 |page=1952 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=glKW-Kh-lmcC&pg=PA1952&lpg=PA1952&dq=AMC+anticipating+trends| isbn=978-1-870979-81-8 |accessdate=March 10, 2012}}</ref> It preached fuel efficiency in the 1950s, long before most auto buyers demanded it. Led by AMC's Rambler and several European cars, the small car innovation reduced the Big Three's market share from 93% in 1957 to 82% in 1959.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rubenstein |first=James M. |title=Making and selling cars: innovation and change in the U.S. automotive industry |year=2001 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-6714-9 |pages=221<U+2013>222 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=2SpJDgcgoMQC&pg=PA222&dq=AMC+Rambler+and+several+European+products+Big+Three+share |accessdate=March 10, 2012}}</ref> The company inherited foreign manufacturing and sales partnerships from Nash and continued developing business relations, decades before most of the international consolidations among automobile makers took place. AMC was the first U.S. automaker to establish ownership agreement with a foreign automaker, Renault.
Although small in size, AMC was able to introduce numerous industry innovations. Starting in 1957, AMC was the only U.S. manufacturer to totally immerse all automobile bodies in [[Primer (paint)|primer paint]] for protection against rust, until competitors adopted the practice in 1964.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abernathy |first=William J. |title=The productivity dilemma: roadblock to innovation in the automobile industry|year=1978|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0-8018-2081-6|pages=207<U+2013>208}}</ref> Even one of AMC's most expensive new product investments (the Pacer) established many features that were later adopted by the auto industry worldwide.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cagan |first2=Craig M. |last2=Vogel |first=Jonathan |title=Creating Breakthrough Products: Innovation from Product Planning to Program Approval |year=2002 |publisher=Financial Times Press |isbn=978-0-13-969694-7 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hlSRf61_nnkC&pg=PA11&dq=many+attributes+the+pacer+incorporated+became+goal+of+all+car+manufacturers |accessdate=March 10, 2012|page=11}}</ref> These included aerodynamic body design, space-efficient interiors, aircraft style doors, and a large greenhouse for visibility. AMC was also effective in other areas such as marketing by introducing low rate financing. AMC's four-wheel drive vehicles established the foundation for the modern SUV market segments, and "classic" Jeep models continue to be the benchmark in this field. Roy D. Chapin drew on his experiences as a hunter and fisherman and marketed the Jeep brand successfully to people with like interests. The brand developed a cult appeal that continues.<ref name= Fracassa>{{cite news|last=Fracassa |first=Hawke |title=Roy D. Chapin Jr., ex-AMC chairman gambled to save Jeep |newspaper=The Detroit News |date=August 7, 2001}}</ref>

The purchase of AMC was instrumental in reviving Chrysler. According to [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Robert Lutz]], former President of Chrysler, the AMC acquisition was a big and risky undertaking.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lutz|first=Robert A.|year=1999| title=Guts: The Seven Laws of Business That Made Chrysler the World's Hottest Car Company| publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-35765-0}}</ref> The purchase was part of Chrysler's strategic "retreat-cum-diversification" plan that he states did not have the right focus. Initially the goal was to obtain the world-renowned Jeep brand. However, Lutz discovered that the decision to buy AMC turned out to be a gold mine for Chrysler.<ref>Lutz, p. 16.</ref> At that time, Chrysler's management was attempting to find a model to improve structure and operations, ''"something that would help get our minds unstuck and thinking beyond the old paradigms that we were so familiar with''".<ref name="lutz-31">Lutz, p. 31.</ref> In this transformation, ''"Chrysler's acquisition of AMC was one of the all-time great moments in corporate serendipity''" according to Lutz ''"that most definitely played a key role in demonstrating how to accomplish change''".<ref name="lutz-31"/>

According to Lutz (1993), while AMC had its share of problems, it was far from being a bunch of "brain-dead losers". He describes the "troops" at AMC as more like the [[Battle of Wake Island|Wake Island Marines]] in battle, "with almost no resources, and fighting a vastly superior enemy, they were able to roll out an impressive succession of new products".<ref name="lutz-33">Lutz, p. 33.</ref> After first reacting with anger to the purchase, Chrysler managers soon anticipated the benefits. To further solidify the organizational competencies held by AMC, Lee Iacocca agreed to retain former AMC units, such as engineering, completely intact. In addition, AMC's lead engineer, [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Castaing]], was made head of all engineering at Chrysler. In an unthinkable strategic move, Castaing completely dismantled the entrenched Chrysler groups. In their place AMC's "[[Automobile platform|platform team]]" was implemented. These were close-knit cross-functional groups responsible for the whole vehicle, as contrasted with Chrysler's highly functional structure. In this capacity, Castaing's strategy was to eliminate the corporate administrative overhead bureaucracy. This move shifted corporate culture and agitated veteran executives who believed that Chrysler's reputation as "the engineering company" was being destroyed. Yet, according to the popular press, by the 1980s Chrysler's reputation was totally shot, and in Lutz's view only dramatic action was going to change that.<ref name="lutz-33"/> In summary, Chrysler's purchase of AMC laid the critical foundation to help re-establish a strategy for its revival in the 1990s.

Top managers at Chrysler after the AMC buyout appeared to have made errors similar to those by AMC. For example, Chrysler invested heavily in new untested models while not keeping up its profitable high-volume lines.

After the DaimlerChrysler merger, the combined company also encountered the problem of having too many [[Automobile platform|platforms]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=John L.|title=Strategic Management|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-4080-1807-1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=K9XQSF2Q0DAC&pg=PA505&dq=Chrysler+Benz+managers+protective |page=504 |accessdate=March 10, 2012 }}</ref> It also failed to achieve synergies by sharing components and from Chrysler's paperless design and supplier capabilities.<ref>{{cite book|last= Haberberg |first=Adrian |first2=Alison |last2=Rieple |title=Strategic Management: Theory and Application |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-921646-8 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Kdds3zeqT94C&pg=PA778&dq=Chrysler+Benz+managers+protective&q |page=778 |accessdate=March 10, 2012 }}</ref> Mercedes-Benz managers were protective of their designs and components and "advanced R&D was clearly put under German direction."<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Carayannis| editor-first=Elias G.|editor2-last=Chanaron|editor2-first=Jean-Jacques|title=Leading and Managing Creators, Inventors, and Innovators: The Art, Science, and Craft of Fostering Creativity, Triggering Invention, and Catalyzing Innovation|year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | isbn=978-1-56720-485-8 |page=292}}</ref> This policy increased production costs. They could have observed the experience of the Nash and Hudson merger designed to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and savings from component sharing. The first product combining Chrysler and Mercedes technology and engineering with a Mercedes name was in 2006,<ref>{{cite book|last=Adler|first= Dennis|title=Daimler & Benz: The Complete History: The Birth and Evolution of the Mercedes-Benz |year=2006 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-06-089026-1 |page=253}}</ref> eight years after DaimlerChrysler AG was created.

The AMC influence also continued at [[General Motors]]. GM recruited a new executive team to turn itself from near bankruptcy in the early 2000s. Among the new strategists at GM was Lutz who brought an understanding of the importance of passion in the product design. Lutz implemented a new thinking at GM that incorporated the systems and structures that originated from AMC's lean and focused operations.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Taylor III |first=Alex |title=Finally GM is looking good|journal=Fortune |volume=145 |issue=7 |date=April 1, 2002 |pages=69<U+2013>74 |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/04/01/320620/index.htm |accessdate=March 10, 2012}}</ref>

Renault implemented the lessons it learned from its investment in AMC. The French firm took a parallel approach as it did with its initial ownership of AMC and applied it to resurrect the money-losing [[Nissan]] automaker in Japan.

==Legacy of products==

===Passenger automobiles===
[[File:Eagle Premier.jpg|thumb|right|Eagle Premier]]
Chrysler revived the "Spirit" name dropped by AMC after 1983 for use on one of its [[Chrysler A platform|A platform]] cars, (the [[Dodge Spirit]]) from 1989<U+2013>1995. The planned [[Renault Medallion]] was sold as the [[Eagle Medallion]] in 1988 and 1989. A Renault/AMC concept, the Summit, was produced by [[Mitsubishi Motors]] beginning in 1989. The planned all-new 1988 Renault Premier, a joint development effort between American Motors and Renault, and for which the [[Brampton Assembly]] plant ([[Brampton]], Ontario<U+2014>originally called the Bramalea Plant) was built, was sold by Chrysler as the 1988<U+2013>1992 [[Eagle Premier]], with a rebadged [[Dodge Monaco]] variant available from 1990<U+2013>1992. The [[Full-size car|full-sized]] Premier's platform was far more advanced than anything Chrysler was building at the time. After some re-engineering and a re-designation to Chrysler [[Chrysler LH platform|code LH]], the Eagle Premier went on to form the backbone of Chrysler's passenger car lineup during the 1990s as the [[Chrysler Concorde]] (a revived model name that was briefly used by [[Plymouth Concord|Plymouth]] in 1951 and 1952), [[Chrysler New Yorker]], [[Chrysler LHS]], [[Dodge Intrepid]], and [[Eagle Vision]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hailig|first=John A.|title=To the Edge and Back: Re-Emergence in the Eighties|journal=Automobile Quarterly|volume=32|issue=4|page=104}}</ref> Plymouth almost received their own rendition of the LH platform, which was to be called the Accolade, but Chrysler decided to nix this idea not long before LH production started. The [[Chrysler 300M]] was likewise a Premier/LH-derived car and was initially to have been the next-generation Eagle Vision, until the [[Eagle (automobile)|Eagle]] brand was dropped after 1998.

===Jeep vehicles===
[[File:Jeep Comanche Chief.jpg|thumb|Jeep Comanche]]
Chrysler marketed the SJ [[Jeep Grand Wagoneer]] until 1991, leaving it almost entirely unaltered from the final AMC rendition before the buyout. The [[Jeep Comanche]] pickup truck remained until 1992, while the Cherokee remained until 2001 in the U.S. (the XJ Cherokee was produced in China through 2006 as the Cherokee 2500<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2007/gb2007112_737100.htm|last=Dunne|first=Timothy|title=Can Chrysler Rebound in China? |journal=Business Week|date=November 2, 2007|accessdate=July 29, 2010}}</ref>). Although it was not introduced until 1993, the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] was initially an AMC-developed vehicle.

Traces of AMC remained within. AMC's Toledo, Ohio plants continued to manufacture the Jeep Wrangler and [[Jeep Liberty|Liberty]], as well as parts and components for Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep vehicles (although Toledo Machining and Forge was closed in 2005). AMC's main plant in Wisconsin, albeit heavily downsized, operated as the [[Kenosha]] Engine Plant, producing engines for several Chrysler Group products including the Wrangler.  The plant was closed as part of the post bailout restructuring of Chrysler in October 2010.  The {{convert|242|cuin|L|1|disp=flip}} engine was used until the 2006 model year by [[DaimlerChrysler]] in the [[Jeep Wrangler]]. AMC's technologically advanced Bramalea Assembly and Stamping Plants in [[Brampton]], Ontario later produced the [[Chrysler LX platform|LX-cars]] <U+2013> the [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Dodge Charger]] and the [[Chrysler 300]], and the now discontinued [[Dodge Magnum]].

In terms of AMC-related parts, some were used as late as 2006, when the [[Jeep Wrangler]] (the last new product introduced by AMC before the Chrysler deal) was still using the [[AMC Straight-6 engine]] in some models, as well as the recessed "paddle" door handles that were used since the 1968 model year by AMC. Both were retired when the Wrangler was completely redesigned for the 2007 model year.

[[AM General]], sold by American Motors in 1982, is still in business building the American Motors-designed [[Humvee]] for American and allied militaries. AM General also built the now-discontinued civilian variant <U+2013> the H1 <U+2013> and manufactured a [[Chevrolet Tahoe]]-derived companion, the H2, under contract to GM, who acquired the rights to the civilian Hummer brand in 1999. GM was forced to phase out the Hummer brand in early 2010 as a part of its bankruptcy restructuring after offering it for sale, but failing to find a suitable buyer.

Although Chrysler introduced new logos for its brands in the 1990s and again in 2010 after the [[Fiat|Fiat Group]] took control of the company, Jeep still uses the AMC-era logo introduced shortly after AMC's purchase of the brand in 1970. Until the Chrysler purchase, Jeep's logo also featured the AMC emblem.

==Legacy of divisions and facilities==

===Former divisions===
During its history, American Motors bought or created, then later sold and divested itself of several specialized divisions, some which continue to exist today:

''[[Kelvinator]]'', the subdivision of Nash-Kelvinator, was sold by American Motors in 1968 to White Consolidated Industries. and subsequently became part of [[Electrolux]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.chhistory.org/FeatureStories.php?Story=KelvinHome |last=Hubbert |first=Christopher J. |title=The Kelvin Home: Cleveland Heights Leads the Way to: 'a New and Better Way of Living |publisher=Cleveland Heights Historical Society |year=2006 |accessdate=November 24, 2010 }}</ref> The Kelvinator Company is still in business.

''[[Jeep]]'' is now a brand of the [[Chrysler Group]]. Many Jeep models retained the mechanical specifications and styling cues that were developed by AMC well into the 1990s or even into the first decade of the 2000s.

''[[AM General]]'' is now owned by MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings and the [[Renco Group]]. It was organized as an LLC in August 2004.

''[[Wheel Horse]] Products Division'' is now owned by the [[Toro (company)|Toro Company]].

''[[Beijing-Benz DaimlerChrysler Automotive|Beijing Jeep]]'' was established by AMC in 1983 to produce Jeeps for the burgeoning Chinese market; the joint venture was inherited by Chrysler and continues under the ownership of the new Chrysler. AMC's trials with the venture were the subject of a fairly well known book on the venture, "Beijing Jeep", by [[James Mann (writer)|James Mann]].

===Facilities===

''AMC World Headquarters'' (1954<U+2013>1975)<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.allpar.com/corporate/factories/PROC.html |title=AMC Headquarters Building, 14250 Plymouth Road, Detroit, Michigan |publisher=allpar.com |accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref> was located at 14250 Plymouth Road in Detroit and was widely known as the ''Plymouth Road Office Center (PROC)''. In 1975, AMC moved its headquarters from the facility on Plymouth Road to a newly constructed building on Northwestern Highway in Southfield, Michigan known as the American Center. When Chrysler and AMC merged in 1987, the building was renamed the [[Chrysler Center]].

The initial building had been built in 1926<U+2013>27 by the Electric Refrigeration Corporation (subsequently [[Nash-Kelvinator]]) with design by Amedeo Leoni, industrial layout by Wallace McKenzie, and tower enclosure and industrial units by William E. Kapp, of SHG. The original {{convert|600000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} three-story factory and four-story administration building had been headquarters to Nash-Kelvinator from 1937<U+2013>1954 as well as a factory for refrigerators, electric ranges, and commercial refrigeration<U+2014>as well as airplane propellers for the U.S. military effort during World War II.

During World War II, the U.S. [[United States Department of War|War Department]] contracted with Nash-Kelvinator to produce 900 [[Sikorsky R-6]] model [[helicopters]]. As part of that contract, a {{convert|4.5|acre|abbr=on}} site north of the factory was used as the smallest airport in the world{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} as a [[flight testing]] base. Nash-Kelvinator produced about fifty R-6s a month during the war. When the contract was terminated at the end of the war, a total of 262 helicopters had been constructed.

During Chrysler's occupancy of the complex, it was known Jeep and (Dodge) Truck Engineering (JTE), including facilities for Body on Frame (BoF) work as well as testing facilities and labs. The buildings included {{convert|1500000|sqft|m2}}, approximately one third devoted to engineering and computer functions.<ref name="allparplymouth">{{cite web|title=PROC (Plymouth Road) sale confirmed| publisher=Allpar|url=http://www.allpar.com/news/index.php/2010/05/proc-plymouth-road-sale-confirmed |date=May 7, 2010 |first=David |last=Zatz |accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref>

As of 2007, Chrysler still employed over 1,600 people at the complex, moving those operations in mid-2009 to the Chrysler Technology Center.

The original "American Center" signage at the top of the building remained until 2005, although the AMC logo has been removed. The signage has since been changed to [[Charter One]]. The 25-story building is rented to several different organizations and companies as office space. After the Chrysler acquisition, Chrysler Financial occupied as much as {{convert|175000|sqft|m2}} of the building.<ref>{{cite web|last=King|first=Jenny|url=http://nreionline.com/mag/real_estate_detroit_not_pretty/|title=Detroit: not just another pretty face, the Motor City and southeast Michigan offer stability, opportunity for growth |publisher=Nreionline.com|date=August 1, 1995 |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}</ref>

* ''Holmes Foundry, Ltd.'' <U+2013> AMC's block-casting foundry was a major AMC factory which is now completely obliterated. Holmes had its main office and [[foundry]] at 200 Exmouth Street, [[Sarnia, Ontario]], Canada. Holmes was established in 1918, by Mr. J. S. Blunt, and was called Holmes Blunt Limited. In the early years, [[Ford Motor Company]] contracted the plant for a steady supply of engine casting blocks. This factory had a reputation locally as a dirty, dangerous place to work. The company had three divisions, all operating on one site at the edge of Sarnia. Beginning in 1962, AMC contracted with Holmes Foundry to supply AMC with [[cylinder block]] castings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/my/HolmesFoundry/|title=Holmes Foundry: Sarnia, Ontario|publisher=holmesfoundry at hotmail period com|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}</ref> American Motors acquired 25% interest in the foundry in January 1966.

* ''Kenosha "Lakefront" (Kenosha, Wisconsin) Plant'' <U+2013> The AMC plant in downtown Kenosha along Lake Michigan was razed, and after reclamation the land was used for new development. At the company's inception in 1954, the plant covered {{convert|3195000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} and together with the Milwaukee plant had an annual production capacity of 350,000 cars.<ref name=Ward>{{cite book|last=Ward| first=James Arthur|title=The Fall of the Packard Motor Car Company|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1995|page=124|isbn=978-0-8047-2457-9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=7D11a-EPzwMC&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=milwaukee+body+plant|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}</ref> 

* ''Milwaukee Body (Milwaukee, Wisconsin) Plant'' <U+2013> AMC inherited a {{convert|1600000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}<ref name=Ward/> body plant in Milwaukee from Nash. The plant was the main body plant for Seaman Body Company, which did a lot of business with Nash and other makers assembling bodies of various designs. For AMC, the plant was sometimes an internal headache. For instance, in late 1961, George Romney himself stormed through the plant and threatened to close it and eliminate its 9,000 jobs due to labor problems.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Management: Crackdown in Milwaukee|journal=Time|date=December 1, 1961 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,938842,00.html|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}</ref> The plant survived until the Chrysler buyout. Chrysler later decided to dispose of the factory. Upon closure, the site was named as a Superfund site. The factory was demolished and the site rehabilitated and redeveloped.

* ''Danforth Ave (Toronto, Ontario) Plant'' <U+2013> Inherited from Nash. This plant was purchased by Nash from Ford of Canada in 1946. The first Canadian-built Nash rolled off the line in April, 1950. Upon the formation of American Motors in 1954, the plant assembled 1955 Nash and Hudson Ramblers (2- and 4-door sedans); as well as Nash Canadian Statesman and Hudson Wasp (4door sedans). In 1956, the plant continued to assemble Nash and Hudson Rambler (4-door sedans and wagons) and the Nash Canadian Statesman (4-door sedan); but The Hudson Wasp was imported. That same year, American Motors Sales (Canada) Limited was formed <U+2013> taking over Nash Motors of Canada Limited and Hudson Motors of Canada Limited. In 1957, AMC assembled the [[Rambler Six]] and [[Rambler Rebel|Rambler Rebel V8]] at the Danforth plant; but in July, 1957, AMC closed the plant and imported Ramblers into Canada until 1961.

* ''[[Tilbury, Ontario]] Assembly Plant'' <U+2013> Another plant AMC inherited from the 1954 merger; this one via Hudson. Specifically, it was a contract with CHATCO Steel Products which actually owned the plant. American Motors ceased Hudson production at the Tilbury plant in 1955.

* ''Brampton Assembly Plant'' <U+2013> AMC opened a plant in 1960 in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. It was part of American Motors Canada, Inc. Rambler Drive, a small street just west of this plant, still exists and leads into a residential subdivision that was built in the 1960s. In 1987, with the Chrysler buy-out, the division and the plant were absorbed as well, becoming part of Chrysler Canada Limited. The plant was closed in 1994 and sold to Wal-Mart for use as their Canadian warehouse. This plant/warehouse was demolished in 2004 and redeveloped in 2007 with multiple smaller commercial buildings now onsite; a new Lowes Home Improvement Warehouse now takes up the largest section of this commercial development. Note that this is a separate facility from the current [[Brampton Assembly|Brampton (formerly Bramalea) Assembly]] and Satellite Stamping Plants nearby.

* ''South Charleston Stamping Plant'' <U+2013> A [[South Charleston, West Virginia]] facility. While AMC leased it, the plant stamped steel automotive parts. In 1978 [[Volkswagen of America]] purchased the plant<ref name="southcharles">{{cite web

Also: Kaiser Jeeps used the AMC 327, Buick 225 ("Dauntless V6"), Buick 350 ("Dauntless V8"), Willys 134 I4 ("Hurricane"). The Downsized Jeep XJ Cherokee/Wagoneer used the Chevrolet 2.8&nbsp;Litre V6 in 1983<U+2013>1984.

<sup>1</sup> AMC contracted with Volkswagen to buy tooling for the Audi 2.0&nbsp;L OHC I4. Major parts (block, crankshaft, head assembly) were initially purchased from Audi and shipped to the U.S. where final assembly was accomplished by AMC at a plant purchased specifically for production of this engine. Sales never reached numbers to justify taking over total production. AMC made several changes to the engine. They were prevented from using the Volkswagen or Audi names in association with the AMC assembled version by contractual agreement.

==Collectibility==

AMC models historically regarded by hobbyists as particularly "collectible" include the Javelin, AMX, and performance specials such as the 1957 Rambler Rebel, 1965<U+2013>67 Marlin, 1969 Hurst SC/Rambler, 1970 Rebel Machine, and 1971 Hornet SC/360. These models enjoyed limited popularity when new, resulting in low production figures.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zuehlke|first=Jeffrey|title= Classic Cars|publisher=Lerner Publications|year=2007|page=18|isbn=978-0-8225-5926-9}}</ref> In January 2007, the AMC AMX was "really taking off in the muscle car market" according to the editors of ''Hemmings Classic Car'', and it had "left its mark among AMC collectors' minds as a great alternative" to higher-priced [[Hemi engine|Hemi]]-powered muscle cars.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.hemmings.com/hcc/stories/2007/01/01/hmn_feature5.html |last=Litwin|first=Matthew|title=The Top 21 Hottest Collector Cars|journal=Hemmings Classic Car|date=January 1, 2007|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}</ref>

The early Javelin (1968<U+2013>70) stands out from the Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler pony cars.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.automobilemag.com/features/collectible_classic/0706_1968_amc_javelin/ |last=Blackwell |first=Rusty |title=Collectible Classic: 1968<U+2013>70 AMC Javelin |journal=Automobile Magazine |month=February |year=2009 |accessdate=August 31, 2012 }}</ref> Car expert Jack Nerad noted in a 2007 article "several fully restored AMX models" listed for sale at "little more than half the price of a comparable [[Buick Gran Sport]], [[Chevrolet Chevelle]], [[Oldsmobile 4-4-2|Olds 4-4-2]] or [[Pontiac GTO]]" in support of the author's opinion that the 1971<U+2013>74 Javelin was "clearly an outstanding alternative muscle car for the enthusiast on a budget."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carprices.com/articles/cars.html |last=Nerad |first=Jack |title=It doesn<U+2019>t take a mint to buy one of tomorrow's top collector cars |work=Driving Today |year=2009 |accessdate=August 31, 2012 }}</ref>

According to James C. Mays, automotive historian and author of ''The Savvy Guide to Buying Collector Cars at Auction'', the "Wow! Factor" is an important and measurable pleasure to an owner whether their car is driven or sits in a climate-controlled garage.<ref name=savvy>{{cite book|last =Mays|first=James C.|title=The Savvy Guide to Buying Collector Cars at Auction|publisher=Indy-Tech Publishing|year=2006|page=77|isbn=978-0-7906-1322-2}}</ref> His "Wow! Factor" includes examples of a bright red 1969 AMX that according to its owner "is just a fast Rambler", but draws more people at events than the more prestigious [[Ferrari]]s and [[Lamborghini]]s, as well as a "million-dollar moment" when a Rambler owner was serenaded with the "Beep Beep" song by [[The Playmates]] while fueling at a travel plaza.<ref name=savvy/> Moreover, the author's collector car, a 1969 Ambassador station wagon, made friends as strangers came to greet and host him as if "long lost kin".<ref>Mays, pp. 37<U+2013>38.</ref> Mays points out the ready availability of parts for AMC engines and his experiences in having service done on Ramblers without being charged for the work in exchange for the experience of driving a "sassy Rambler" (a 1966 American convertible) and having pictures taken with it.<ref>Mays, pp. 39<U+2013>40.</ref>

Other AMC models, once somewhat ignored by the hobby, are now considered "future collectibles". Examples include the 1959 Ambassador 4-door hardtop station wagon, of which only 578 were produced, and the Jeep Scrambler CJ8, a combined pickup truck-Jeep, of which only a few thousand were produced.

''Hemmings Classic Car'' magazine included the 1969<U+2013>70 Rebel SST and the 1974<U+2013>78 Matador coupe in their 2008 list of "dollar-for-pound [weight]" cars that could be bought in show-quality condition for a comparatively modest outlay,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.hemmings.com/hcc/stories/2008/01/01/hmn_feature1.html|last=Koch|first=Jeff |title=Dollar-A-Pound Collectibles|journal=Hemmings Classic Car|volume=4|issue=1|pages=14<U+2013>19|date=January 1, 2008|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}</ref> The writer also noted that "most of AMC's '70s lineup" qualified for inclusion on the list.

The AMC Gremlin is described to have "a cult-like following in today's collectible car market.<ref name=StLouis>{{cite news|url= http://www.stltoday.com/classifieds/transportation/reviews/article_88ceab86-32b2-5758-9484-8c48522f060e.html |last=Kunz|first=Bruce|title=1970 AMC Gremlin- America's first "sub" compact car|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=December 3, 2007|accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref> The Gremlin shares components with some other AMC models its repair and restoration can be relatively inexpensive compared with other "historic cars".<ref name=StLouis/>

The AMC Pacer increased in value according to a Pacer owner who is the CEO of a major insurance provider for collector car owners.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.businessweek.com/autos/content/aug2007/bw20070823_780539.htm |last=Palmeri |first=Christopher |title=Revenge of the Nerd Cars |journal=Business Week |date= August 23, 2007 |accessdate=November 24, 2010 }}</ref>

There are active Rambler and AMC car clubs in the U.S. and elsewhere (examples in [[American Motors#External links|External Links]]).

===Hot Rod Magazine revival April Fool's joke===
In April 2008, [[Hot Rod Magazine]] released an article claiming that American Motors was in the process of being revived. The vehicles in the works were to be the [[AMC AMX|AMX]], [[AMC Matador|Matador]], [[AMC Ambassador|Ambassador]], [[AMC Pacer|Pacer]], and [[AMC Gremlin|Gremlin]]. Illustrated with drawings of the [[concept car]]s entering production and accompanied by plentiful information, it was a popular article, although it was later revealed to be an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools']] joke.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stanford|first=Steve|url= http://www.hotrod.com/featuredvehicles/hrdp_0804_amc_concept_cars/index.html |title=AMC Concept Cars <U+2013> The Return Of AMC!
