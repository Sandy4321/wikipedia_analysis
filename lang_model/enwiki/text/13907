'''Microsoft Windows''' is the name of several families of [[software]] [[operating system]]s by [[Microsoft]]. Microsoft first introduced an operating environment named ''Windows'' in November 1985 as an add-on to [[MS-DOS]] in response to the growing interest in [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs).<ref name=aboutcomnov>{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/mstartinventions/a/Windows.htm?rd=1|title=http://inventors.about.com/od/mstartinventions/a/Windows.htm?rd=1|accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref> Microsoft Windows eventually came to dominate the world's [[personal computer]] market, overtaking [[Mac OS]], which had been introduced previously. At the 2004 [[International Data Corporation|IDC]] Directions conference, IDC Vice President Avneesh Saxena stated that Windows had approximately 90% of the client operating system market.<ref name=linuxworld>[http://www.linuxworld.com.au/index.php/id;940707233;fp;2;fpid;1 IDC: Consolidation to Windows won't happen] www.linuxworld.com.au</ref> The current [[client]] version of Windows is [[Windows Vista]]. The current [[server]] version of Windows is [[Windows Server 2003]]. The successor to [[Windows Server 2003]], [[Windows Server 2008]] is currently being [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta tested]].

The term ''Windows'' collectively describes any or all of several generations of Microsoft (MS) operating system (OS) products. These products are generally categorized as follows:

===16-bit operating environments===
[[Image:Windows 1.0.jpg|thumb|top|right|200px|The box art of Windows 1.0, the first version that Microsoft released to the public.]]

The early versions of Windows were often thought of as just graphical user interfaces, mostly because they ran on top of [[MS-DOS]] and used it for [[file system]] services.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} However even the earliest 16-bit Windows versions already assumed many typical operating system functions, notably having their own [[executable file format]] and providing their own [[device driver]]s (timer, graphics, printer, mouse, keyboard and sound) for applications. Unlike [[MS-DOS]], Windows allowed users to execute multiple graphical applications at the same time, through [[computer multitasking|cooperative multitasking]]. Finally, Windows implemented an elaborate, segment-based, software virtual memory scheme which allowed it to run applications larger than available memory: code segments and [[resource (Windows)|resource]]s were swapped in and thrown away when memory became scarce, and data segments moved in memory when a given application had relinquished processor control, typically waiting for user input.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} 16-bit Windows versions include [[Windows 1.0]] (1985), [[Windows 2.0]] (1987) and its close relative ''[[Windows 2.0|Windows]]/[[Intel 80286|286]]''.

===Hybrid 16/32-bit operating environments===
[[Image:Microsoft Windows.svg|thumb|left|A classic Windows logo. Was used from 1992 to 1999.]]

[[Windows 2.0|Windows]]/[[Intel 80386|386]] introduced a 32-bit [[protected mode]] [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] and [[virtual machine]] monitor. For the duration of a Windows session, it created one or more [[virtual 8086 mode|virtual 8086 environments]] and provided device virtualization for the video card, keyboard, mouse, timer and [[interrupt]] controller inside each of them. The user-visible consequence was that it became possible to preemptively multitask multiple MS-DOS environments in separate Windows (graphical applications required switching the window to full screen mode). Windows applications were still multi-tasked cooperatively inside one of such real-mode environments.

[[Windows 3.0]] (1990) and [[Windows 3.1x|Windows 3.1]] (1992) improved the design, mostly because of [[virtual memory]] and loadable virtual device drivers ([[VxD]]s) which allowed them to share arbitrary devices between multitasked DOS windows.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} Because of this, Windows applications could now run in 16-bit protected mode (when Windows was running in Standard or 386 Enhanced Mode), which gave them access to several megabytes of memory and removed the obligation to participate in the software virtual memory scheme. They still ran inside the same address space, where the segmented memory provided a degree of protection, and multi-tasked cooperatively. For Windows 3.0, Microsoft also rewrote critical operations from [[C (programming language)|C]] into [[Assembly language|assembly]], making this release faster and less memory-hungry than its predecessors.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

===Hybrid 16/32-bit operating systems===
[[Image:Wlogo.png|thumb|right|The Windows logo that was used from late 1999 to 2001.]]

With the introduction of [[32-bit]] [[Windows for Workgroups 3.11]], Windows was able to stop relying on DOS for file management.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} Leveraging this, [[Windows 95]] introduced [[Long filename|Long File Names]], reducing the [[8.3 filename]] DOS environment to the role of a [[boot loader]]. MS-DOS was now bundled with Windows; this notably made it (partially) aware of long file names when its utilities were run from within Windows. The most important novelty was the possibility of running 32-bit multi-threaded preemptively multitasked graphical programs. However, the necessity of keeping compatibility with 16-bit programs meant the GUI components were still 16-bit only and not fully reentrant, which resulted in reduced performance and stability.

There were three releases of Windows 95 (the first in 1995, then subsequent bug-fix versions in 1996 and 1997, only released to OEMs, which added extra features such as [[File Allocation Table|FAT32]] and primitive USB support). Microsoft's next OS was [[Windows 98]]; there were two versions of this (the first in 1998 and the second, named "Windows 98 Second Edition", in 1999). In 2000, Microsoft released [[Windows Me]] (''Me'' standing for ''Millennium Edition''), which used the same core as Windows 98 but adopted the visual appearance of Windows 2000, as well as a new feature called System Restore, allowing the user to set the computer's settings back to an earlier date.  Microsoft left little time for Windows 2000 to become popular before announcing their next version of Windows which would be called Windows XP.

===32-bit operating systems===
[[Image:Microsoft Windows.png|thumb|left|The Windows logo that was used from 2001 to November 2006.]]

This family of Windows systems was fashioned and marketed for higher reliability business use, and was unencumbered by any Microsoft DOS patrimony.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} The first release was [[Windows NT 3.1]] (1993, numbered "3.1" to match the Windows version and to one-up [[OS/2]] 2.1{{fact|date=September 2007}}, IBM's flagship OS co-developed by Microsoft and was Windows NT's main competitor at the time), which was followed by NT 3.5 (1994), NT 3.51 (1995), and [[Windows NT 4.0|NT 4.0]] (1996); NT 4.0 was the first in this line to implement the Windows 95 user interface. Microsoft then moved to combine their consumer and business operating systems. Their first attempt, [[Windows 2000]], failed to meet their goals,{{Fact|date=July 2007}} and was released as a business system. The home consumer edition of Windows 2000, [[Microsoft codenames|codenamed]] "[[Windows Neptune]]," ceased development and Microsoft released [[Windows Me]] in its place.{{fact|date=September 2007}} Eventually "Neptune" was merged into their new project, Whistler, which later became [[Windows XP]], which came in both home and professional versions. Then, [[Windows Server 2003]] brought [[Windows Server]] up to date with Windows XP. Since then, [[Windows Vista]] was released and [[Windows Server 2008]] will bring [[Windows Server]] up to date with [[Windows Vista]]. [[Windows CE]], Microsoft's offering in the mobile and embedded markets, is also a true 32-bit operating system that offers various services for all sub-operating workstations.

===64-bit operating systems===
[[Image:Windows logo full.png|thumb|right|180px|The current Windows logo]]

[[Windows NT]] included support for several different platforms before the [[X86 architecture|x86]]-based [[personal computer]] became dominant in the professional world. Versions of NT from 3.1 to 4.0 supported [[DEC Alpha]] and [[MIPS Technologies|MIPS]] R4000, which were 64-bit processors, although the operating system treated them as 32-bit processors.

With the introduction of the [[Intel]] [[Itanium]] architecture, which is referred to as [[IA-64]], Microsoft released new versions of Windows 2000 to support it. Itanium versions of [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] were released at the same time as their mainstream x86 (32-bit) counterparts. On [[April 25]] [[2005]], Microsoft released [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]] and x64 versions of Windows Server 2003 to support the [[x86-64|AMD64/Intel64]] (or ''x64'' in Microsoft terminology) architecture. Microsoft dropped support for the Itanium version of Windows XP in 2005. The modern 64-bit Windows family comprises [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]] for AMD64/Intel64 systems, and [[Windows Server 2003]], in both Itanium and x64 editions. [[Windows Vista]] is the first end-user version of Windows that Microsoft has released simultaneously in 32-bit and x64 editions. Windows Vista does not support the Itanium architecture.

==History==
{{main|History of Microsoft Windows}}
<!-- [[Image:Windows Family Tree.png|thumb|right|300px|The Windows family tree.]] -->

Microsoft has taken two parallel routes in operating systems. One route has been the home user and the other has been the professional IT user. The dual route has generally led to the home versions with greater [[multimedia]] support and less functionality in networking and security, and professional versions with inferior multimedia support and better networking and security.

The first independent version of Microsoft Windows, version 1.0, released in November 1985, lacked a degree of functionality and achieved little popularity, and was to compete with Apple's own operating system.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} Windows 1.0 did not provide a complete operating system; rather, it extended MS-DOS. Microsoft Windows version 2.0 was released in November, 1987 and was slightly more popular than its predecessor. Windows 2.03 (release date January 1988) had changed the OS from tiled Windows to overlapping Windows. The result of this change led to Apple Computer filing a suit against Microsoft alleging infringement on Apple's copyrights.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

[[Image:Windows 3.11 workspace.png|thumb|right|300px|A Windows for Workgroups 3.11 desktop.]]

Microsoft Windows version 3.0, released in 1990, was the first Microsoft Windows version to achieve broad commercial success, selling 2 million copies in the first six months.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} It featured improvements to the user interface and to multitasking capabilities. It received a facelift in Windows 3.1, made generally available on [[March 1]], [[1992]]. Windows 3.1 support ended on [[December 31]], [[2001]].<ref>http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?p1=3078</ref>  

In July 1993, Microsoft released [[Windows NT]] based on a new kernel. NT was considered to be the professional OS and was the first Windows version to utilize [[preemptive multitasking]].{{Fact|date=April 2007}}. Windows NT and the Windows DOS/9x based line would later be fused together to create Windows XP.

In August 1995, Microsoft released [[Windows 95]], which made further changes to the user interface, and also used [[preemptive multitasking]].   Mainstream support for [[Windows 95]] ended on [[December 31]], [[2000]] and extended support for [[Windows 95]] ended on [[December 31]], [[2001]].<ref>http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?p1=7864</ref>

The next in line was Microsoft [[Windows 98]] released in June 1998. It was substantially criticized for its slowness and for its unreliability compared with [[Windows 95]], but many of its basic problems were later rectified with the release of [[Windows 98]] Second Edition in 1999.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} Mainstream support for [[Windows 98]] ended on [[June 30]], [[2002]] and extended support for [[Windows 98]] ended on [[July 11]], [[2006]].<ref>http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?p1=6513</ref>

As part of its "professional" line, Microsoft released [[Windows 2000]] in February 2000. The consumer version following Windows 98 was [[Windows Me]] (Windows Millennium Edition). Released in September 2000, [[Windows Me]] attempted to implement a number of new technologies for Microsoft: most notably publicized was "[[Universal Plug and Play]]." However, the OS was heavily criticized for its lack of compatibility and stability and it was even rated by PC World as the fourth worst product of all time.<ref>http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,125772-page,2/article.html</ref>

In October 2001, Microsoft released [[Windows XP]], a version built on the Windows NT [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] that also retained the consumer-oriented usability of Windows 95 and its successors. This new version was widely praised in computer magazines.<ref>http://review.zdnet.com/4520-6033_16-4206367.html</ref> It shipped in two distinct editions, "Home" and "Professional", the former lacking many of the superior security and networking features of the Professional edition. Additionally, the first "Media Center" edition was released in 2002,<ref>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/freestyle_preview.asp</ref> with an emphasis on support for DVD and TV functionality including program recording and a remote control. Mainstream support for [[Windows XP]] will continue until [[April 14]], [[2009]] and extended support will continue until [[April 8]], [[2014]].<ref>http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?p1=3223</ref>

In April 2003, [[Windows Server 2003]] was introduced, replacing the [[Windows 2000]] line of server products with a number of new features and a strong focus on security; this was followed in December 2005 by Windows Server 2003 R2.

On [[January 30]], [[2007]] Microsoft released [[Windows Vista]]. It contains a number of [[Features new to Windows Vista|new features]], from a redesigned shell and user interface to significant [[Technical features new to Windows Vista|technical changes]], with a particular focus on [[Security and safety features new to Windows Vista|security features]]. It is available in a number of [[Windows Vista editions and pricing|different editions]], more than any previous version of Windows.

==Security==
[[Image:XPsp2 SecurityCentre FirewallAlert.png|thumbnail|right|225px|The [[Windows Security Center]] was introduced with Windows XP Service Pack 2.]]

[[Computer security|Security]] has been a hot topic with Windows for many years, and even Microsoft itself has been the victim of security breaches. Consumer versions of Windows were originally designed for ease-of-use on a single-user PC without a network connection, and did not have security features built in from the outset. [[Windows NT]] and its successors are designed for security (including on a network) and multi-user PCs, but are not designed with Internet security in mind as much since, when it was first developed in the early 1990s, Internet use was less prevalent. These design issues combined with flawed code (such as [[buffer overflow]]s) and the popularity of Windows means that it is a frequent target of [[computer worm|worm]] and [[computer virus|virus]] writers. In June 2005, [[Bruce Schneier]]'s ''Counterpane Internet Security'' reported that it had seen over 1,000 new viruses and worms in the previous six months.<ref>{{cite web

Microsoft releases security patches through its [[Windows Update]] service approximately once a month (usually the second Tuesday of the month), although critical updates are made available at shorter intervals when necessary.<ref>{{cite web

===Windows Defender===
[[Image:Windows Defender Vista.png|thumbnail|right|225px|[[Windows Defender]]]]
On [[6 January]] [[2005]], Microsoft released a beta version of Microsoft AntiSpyware, based upon the previously released [[GIANT Company Software|Giant]] AntiSpyware. On [[14 February]], [[2006]], Microsoft AntiSpyware became [[Windows Defender]] with the release of beta 2. Windows Defender is a freeware program designed to protect against spyware and other unwanted software.  [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] users who have [[Windows Genuine Advantage|genuine]] copies of Microsoft Windows can freely download the program from Microsoft's web site, and Windows Defender ships as part of [[Windows Vista]].<ref name=defendervista>{{cite web|url=http://www.Microsoft.com/Windowsvista/features/foreveryone/security.mspx|title=Windows Vista: Features|accessdate=2006-07-20}}</ref>

===Third-party analysis===
In an article based on a report by Symantec,<ref name=thereg>{{cite web|url= http://www.symantec.com/enterprise/theme.jsp?themeid=threatreport|title=Symantec 11th Internet Security Threat Report, Trends for July<U+2013>December 06}}</ref> internetnews.com has described Microsoft Windows as having the "fewest number of patches and the shortest average patch development time of the five operating systems it monitored in the last six months of 2006."<ref>http://www.internetnews.com/security/article.php/3667201</ref> And the number of vulnerabilities found in Windows has significantly increased<U+2014> Windows: 12+, Red Hat + Fedora: 2, Apple OS X: 1, HP-UX: 2, Solaris: 1.

A study conducted by [[Kevin Mitnick]] and marketing communications firm Avantgarde in 2004 found that an unprotected and unpatched Windows XP system with Service Pack 1 lasted only 4 minutes on the Internet before it was compromised, and an unprotected and also unpatched [[Windows Server 2003]] system was compromised after being connected to the internet for 8 hours.<ref name=hackXP>[http://www.avantgarde.com/ttln113004.html Automated "Bots" Overtake PCs Without Firewalls Within 4 Minutes] www.avantgarde.com</ref> However, it is important to note that this study does not apply to Windows XP systems running the Service Pack 2 update (released in late 2004), which vastly improved the security of Windows XP. The computer that was running Windows XP Service Pack 2 was not compromised. The [[AOL]] National Cyber Security Alliance Online Safety Study of October 2004 determined that 80% of Windows users were infected by at least one [[spyware]]/[[adware]] product.<ref name=adware>[http://www.staysafeonline.info/pdf/safety_study_v04.pdf Safety Study] www.staysafeonline.info (PDF)</ref> Much documentation is available describing how to increase the security of Microsoft Windows products. Typical suggestions include deploying Microsoft Windows behind a hardware or software [[firewall]], running [[anti-virus]] and [[anti-spyware]] software, and installing patches as they become available through [[Windows Update]].{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

==Windows Lifecycle Policy==
Microsoft has stopped releasing updates and hotfixes for many old Windows operating systems, including all versions of Windows 9x and earlier versions of Windows NT. Windows versions prior to [[Windows XP|XP]] are no longer supported, with the exception of [[Windows 2000]], which is currently in the Extended Support Period, that will end on [[July 13]], [[2010]]. Windows XP versions prior to SP2 are no longer supported as well. Also, support for [[Windows XP 64-bit Edition]] ended after the release of the more recent [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]].{{Fact|date=April 2007}} However, it is possible for users of older, now unsupported versions of Windows to download and install updates, by going to the Windows Update catalog.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

==Emulation software==
<!-- Please do not put generic IBM PC emulators here. This section is for software that emulates Windows API. -->
Emulation allows the use of some Windows applications without using Microsoft Windows. These include:
*[[Wine (software)|Wine]] - (Stands for "Wine Is Not an Emulator") an almost-complete [[free software]]/[[open-source software]] implementation of the [[Windows API]], allowing one to run most Windows applications on x86-based platforms, including [[GNU]]/[[Linux kernel|Linux]]. Wine is technically not an emulator; an emulator effectively 'pretends' to be a different CPU, while Wine makes use of Windows-style APIs to 'simulate' the Windows environment directly.
*[[CrossOver]] - A Wine package with licensed fonts. Its developers are regular contributors to Wine, and focus on Wine running officially supported applications.
*[[Cedega]] - [[TransGaming Technologies]]' proprietary [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of Wine, which is designed specifically for running games written for Microsoft Windows under GNU/Linux.
*[[ReactOS]] - An open-source OS that intends to run the same software as Windows, at an early alpha stage.
*[[Darwine]] - This project intends to port and develop Wine as well as other supporting tools that will allow [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] and [[Mac OS X]] users to run Microsoft Windows applications, and to provide [[Win32]] [[Application Programming Interface|API]] compatibility at application source code level.
