'''Crystal Palace''' is a residential area in [[South London]], England named after the former local landmark, [[The Crystal Palace]],<ref name="mills">{{cite book|last=Mills|first=A|title=Oxford Dictionary of London Place Names|year=2000}}</ref> which occupied the area from 1854 to 1936. The area is located approximately 8&nbsp;miles south east of [[Charing Cross]] and includes one of the [[List of highest points in London|highest points in London]], at {{convert|367|ft}},<ref name=OSHeight>Spot Height in feet, TQ337707, Ordnance Survey Map, 1862</ref> offering views over the capital.  The area has no defined boundaries and straddles the convergence of five London boroughs and three [[London postal district|postal districts]], although an [[Crystal Palace (ward)|electoral ward]] named Crystal Palace and [[Crystal Palace Park]] are entirely contained within the [[London Borough of Bromley]].  It is contiguous with [[Anerley]], [[Dulwich Wood]], [[Gipsy Hill]], [[Penge]], [[South Norwood]], [[Sydenham]] and [[Upper Norwood]].  

The district was a natural oak forest until development began in the 19th century and before the arrival of The Crystal Palace the area was known as [[Sydenham Hill]].  The [[Norwood Ridge]] and an historic oak tree were used to mark parish boundaries, which ultimately led to the area encompassing the boundaries of five [[London Boroughs]].  Today, the area is represented by three different [[Parliamentary constituencies of the UK parliament|parliamentary constituencies]], four [[London Assembly constituencies]] and fourteen local authority [[Councillors#United Kingdom|councillors]].  After The Crystal Palace burned down in 1936, the site of the building and its grounds became Crystal Palace Park, which is now home to the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|National Sports Centre]], containing an athletics track, stadium and other sports facilities.  Crystal Palace Park has also been the setting for a number of concerts and films, including scenes from ''[[The Italian Job]]'' and ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1952 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]''.  Two television transmitter [[Crystal Palace transmitting station|masts]] make the district a landmark location, visible from many parts of Greater London.  Other major landmarks include the Crystal Palace Triangle, a shopping district made up of three streets forming a triangle; Westow Park, a smaller park that lies off the triangle to the south west of Crystal Palace Park; and the Stambourne Woodland Walk.

A [[pneumatic railway]] was briefly trialled in the area in 1864.  Once the railways had arrived, Crystal Palace was eventually served by two railway stations, the [[Crystal Palace (High Level) railway station|high level]] and [[Crystal Palace railway station|low level]] stations, built to handle the volume of passengers visiting the exhibition.  After the palace was destroyed by fire and with [[Beeching axe#Background|railway travel declining]] in the UK more generally, passenger numbers fell and the high level station was closed in 1954 and demolished 7&nbsp;years later.  Rail services gradually declined and for a period in the 1960s and 1970s there were plans to construct an urban motorway through the area as part of the [[London Ringways]] plan.  More recently, rail travel has seen a resurgence in Crystal Palace, with rising passenger numbers, additional [[London Overground]] services stopping at the station, a [[Crystal Palace railway station#Station redevelopment for East London Line|major station redevelopment]] in 2012 and [[Tramlink route 5|proposals]] to extend the [[Croydon Tramlink]] service to the railway and bus stations.

==History==

The ridge and the historic [[oak]] tree known as ''The Vicars Oak'' (located at the present-day [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] of the [[A212 road|A212]] Church Road and [[A214 road|A214]] Westow Hill) were used to mark parish boundaries.<ref name="BritHistNorwood">{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=49779 |title=Norwood: Introduction |author=F.

The area also straddles three [[UK postcodes|postcode districts]]: {{postcode|SE|19}}, {{postcode|SE|20}}, and {{postcode|SE|26}}. The ancient boundary between [[Surrey]] and [[Kent]] passes through the area and from 1889 to 1965 the area lay on the south eastern boundary of the [[County of London]]. It included parts of Kent and Surrey until 1889 and then parts of Kent, London and Surrey between 1889-1965.<ref name=CroydonUpperNorwoodConsArea>{{cite web|url=http://www.croydon.gov.uk/contents/departments/democracy/pdf/949725/caamps/upper-norwood-triangle.pdf|title=UPPER NORWOOD TRIANGLE CONSERVATION AREA APPRAISAL AND MANAGEMENT PLAN|publisher=Croydon Borough Council|accessdate=9 September 2013|page=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=1933 Ordance Survey Map|year=1933|publisher=OS}}</ref> 

For centuries the area was occupied by the [[Great North Wood]], an extensive area of natural oak forest that formed a wilderness close to the southern edge of the then expanding city of London.  The forest was a popular area for Londoners' recreation right up to the 19th century, when it began to be built over.<ref name=BritHistNorwood /> It was also a home of [[Romani people|Gypsies]], with some local street names and pubs recording the link.<ref name=BritHistNorwood />  The area still retains vestiges of woodland. The third quarter of the 19th Century brought the Crystal Palace and the [[railways]].

===The Crystal Palace===
[[File:Crystal Palace General view from Water Temple.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Image of the Crystal Palace before it was destroyed by fire.|The Crystal Palace]]
{{Main|The Crystal Palace}}

The Crystal Palace was a [[Cast iron|cast-iron]] and [[glass]] building originally erected in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] to house the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851. Following the success of the exhibition, the palace was moved and reconstructed in 1854 in a modified and enlarged form in the grounds of the Penge Place estate at [[Sydenham Hill]]. The buildings housed the [[Crystal Palace School| Crystal Palace School of Art, Science, and Literature and Crystal Palace School of Engineering]]. It attracted visitors for over seven decades.<ref name="ricEduPotter">{{cite web|last=Potter|first=Russell|title=The Crystal Palace|url=http://www.ric.edu/faculty/rpotter/cryspal.html|date=29 Jan 2007|accessdate=12 Oct 2008}}</ref>

Sydenham Hill is one of the [[List of highest points in London|highest locations in London]]; 109&nbsp;metres (357&nbsp;ft) above sea level (spot height on Ordnance Survey Map); and the size of the palace and prominence of the site made it easy to identify from much of London. This led to the residential area around the building becoming known as Crystal Palace instead of [[Sydenham Hill]]. The palace was destroyed by fire on 30 November 1936 and the site of the building and its grounds is now known as Crystal Palace Park.

Crystal Palace still retains much of its Victorian architecture, although housing styles are mixed, including Victorian terraces, mid-war terraces and blocks of modern flats. Crystal Palace Park is surrounded by grand Victorian villas, many of which have been converted into flats and apartments.{{Citation needed|reason=No source given for architectural style of area|date=May 2013}}

Crystal Palace Park is a large Victorian [[pleasure ground]] occupying much of the land within Crystal Palace and is one of the major London public parks.  The park was maintained by the [[London County Council|LCC]] and later the [[Greater London Council|GLC]], but with the abolition of the GLC in 1986 control of the entire park was given to the London Borough of Bromley.<ref name="BromleyPark">{{cite web|title=About Crystal Palace Park - History of the park|url=http://www.bromley.gov.uk/info/200073/parks_and_open_spaces/780/about_crystal_palace_park/2|work=London Borough of Bromley Website|publisher=London Borough of Bromley|accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref>  The [[Crystal Palace railway station]] is located in the park, as is the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|National Sports Centre]].

The park is situated halfway along the [[Norwood Ridge]] at one of its highest points. This ridge offers views northward to central London, east to the [[Queen Elizabeth II Bridge]] and [[Greenwich]], and southward to [[Croydon]] and the [[North Downs]].

It is also one of the starting points for the [[South East London Green Chain|Green Chain Walk]], linking to places such as [[Chislehurst]], [[Erith]], the [[Thames Barrier]] and [[Thamesmead]]. Section 3 of the [[Capital Ring]] walk round London goes through the park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walklondon.org.uk/uploads/File/leaflets/cr3directions(1)_31052010140549.pdf|title=Capital Ring, Section 3, Grove Park to Crystal Palace|work=Walk London|date=April 2010|accessdate=September 21, 2013}}</ref>

To the south of the triangle is a small area of woodland occupying 1.92&nbsp;hectares, containing the Stambourne Woodland Walk.  It was opened in 1984 and covers an area of land between developments on Stambourne Way and Fox Hill. The land originally formed the gardens of Victorian villas built on the hill overlooking Croydon, but fell into disrepair.  In 1962 Croydon Council approved terms for buying the land from the [[Church Commissioners]] and other local freeholders, allowing the construction of a link.  Paths and benches were installed but much of the vegetation was left undisturbed, creating a woodland pathway.<ref name="CroydonStambourne">{{cite web|title=Stambourne Woodland Walk History|url=http://www.croydon.gov.uk/leisure/parksandopenspaces/parksatoz/stambourne/swwhistory|work=Croydon Council Website|publisher=Croydon Council|accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref>

===Literature===
[[Arthur Conan Doyle]] was active in the area between 1891 and 1894. Although he lived in nearby [[South Norwood]] he visited the Crystal Palace and [[Upper Norwood]] area regularly in connection with the Upper Norwood Literary and Scientific Society. The Foresters Hall on Westow Street was then known as the Welcome Hall (or just Welcome) and it was in that hall in May 1892 that Arthur Conan Doyle was elected president of the society. He was re-elected to the post in 1893 and resigned in 1894. Each occasion was in the same hall.<ref>The Norwood Author - Arthur Conan Doyle & The Norwood Years (1891-1894) by Alistair Duncan ISBN 978-1-904312-69-7</ref>

==Sports==
Crystal Palace has had a long association with sports and [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)]] was one of the 12 founder members of [[The Football Association]].  The original football club disappeared from records in 1876 and it was not until 1905 that the current [[Crystal Palace F.C.]] club was re-formed.  The club played on the grounds of [[The Crystal Palace]], on what is now the site of the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|National Sports Centre]], until it moved to Selhurt in 1918.  The grounds also hosted the [[FA Cup Final]] between 1895 and 1914.  Despite the move to Selhurst, the club retained the Crystal Palace name, which is in use to the present day.<ref name="CPFCHistory">{{cite web|last=Byfield|first=Terry|title=History|url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/|work=Crystal Palace Football Club website|publisher=Crystal Palace Football Club|accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref>  

The historical grounds also hosted the first [[England national rugby union team|England Rugby Union]] match against New Zealand in 1905, which New Zealand won by 15-0, and the short-lived [[London County Cricket Club]].

In 1964, a 15,500 seater athletics stadium and sports centre was built on the site of the football grounds in Crystal Palace Park.  The athletics stadium was known as the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|National Sports Centre]] and between 1999 and 2012 hosted the [[London Grand Prix|London Athletics Grand Prix]] among other international athletics meetings.  The Crystal Palace triathletes club is also based here.<ref name="CPTriath">{{cite web|title=Welcome to the CPT website|url=http://www.crystalpalace-tri.co.uk/|work=Crystal Palace Triathletes Website|publisher=Crystal Palace Triathletes|accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref>
Since the [[London 2012 Olympics]], the status of the stadium and aquatics centre as the main facilities for their sports in London has been superseded by the [[London Aquatics Centre]] and [[Olympic Stadium (London)|Olympic Stadium]].  This led to Crystal Palace F.C. submitting plans to rebuild the stadium as a 40,000 capacity football stadium, without the running track.

A [[Crystal Palace circuit|motor racing circuit]] was opened around the Park in 1927 and the remains of the track now make up some of the access roads around the park.  The track was extended to two miles in 1936, before being taken over by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] at the start of [[World War II]].  Race meetings resumed in 1953, and the circuit hosted a range of international racing events, continuing until the last races in 1974.

There is a coach park inside Crystal Palace Park.

The area would have been affected by the cancelled [[London Ringways]] [[motorway]] plans, as one of the radial routes connecting the [[South Cross Route]] to [[Ringway 2]] (the [[South Cross Route to Parkway D Radial]]) would have run through a part of Crystal Palace Park, following the railway line.<ref name="CBRDSCrossRouteDRadial">{{cite web|last=Marshall|first=Chris|title=South Cross Route to Parkway D Radial|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/histories/ringways/southern/scrpdr.shtml|work=Chris's British Road Directory|publisher=cbrd.co.uk|accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref>

Crystal Palace is accessible by rail via the [[Crystal Palace railway station]], where [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]] trains run to and from [[London Victoria station|Victoria]] and [[London Bridge rail station|London Bridge]] railway stations on the [[Outer South London Line]].  In addition, Southern services run to [[Beckenham Junction station|Beckenham Junction]], [[Sutton railway station (London)|Sutton]] and [[Epsom Downs railway station|Epsom Downs]].<ref name="nationalRail">{{cite web|title=National Rail Enquiries|url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk|work=National Rail Website|publisher=National Rail|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>  Crystal Palace railway station is one of the few stations to border two [[London fare zones|zones]], Zones 3 and 4.<ref name="tflRailMap">{{cite web|title=London's Rail and Tube Services|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/oyster-rail-services-map.pdf|work=Transport for London|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>  The South Gate of the Park is accessible by rail via [[Penge West railway station|Penge West]], which is served by Southern trains from [[London Bridge railway station|London Bridge]] and [[London Overground]] services.

Crystal Palace used to have a second railway station, the [[Crystal Palace (High Level) railway station]].  The station was built to serve passengers visiting the Crystal Palace, but after the fire in 1936 traffic on [[Crystal Palace and South London Junction Railway|the branch line]] declined.  During [[World War II]] the line serving the station was temporarily closed due to bomb damage. Although repairs were made and the line was reopened, the requirement for reconstruction work and the drop in traffic led to the decision to close the station and branch line in 1954, followed by the demolition of the station in 1961.  Despite the demolition, a [[Grade 2 listed#Categories of listed building|Grade II listed]] subway remains under Crystal Palace Parade.<ref name="CrystalPalace">{{cite web|title=Site Name: Crystal Palace High Level Station subway|url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/sites/c/crystal_palace_subway/index.shtml|work=Subterranea Britannica|publisher=Subterranea Britannica|accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref> The [[Crystal Palace pneumatic railway]] was also built in Crystal Palace circa 1864.

[[File:Unit 378149 at Crystal Palace.JPG|left|alt=A London Overground train waiting at a platform in the station.|thumb|London Overground train at Crystal Palace.]]
The low level station remained open, although passenger numbers at that station also fell after the fire of 1936 and many services were diverted to serve London-Croydon routes instead of the [[Outer South London Line]].  Rail travel was in decline across the UK in the 1960s and 1970s when the [[Beeching Axe]] was imposed. During the 1970s, two outer platforms used by terminating trains were abandoned and the third rail was removed.  

More recently rail travel at the station has seen a resurgence and new services have started running. Passenger numbers increased each year between 2004 and 2013.<ref name=ORRFigures>{{cite web|title=Estimates of station usage|url=http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/server/show/nav.1529|work=Rail Statistics|publisher=Office of Rail Regulation|accessdate=29 September 2013}}</ref> Since May 2010, the station has served the [[East London Line]] branch of the [[London Overground]], connecting with the [[London Docklands|Docklands]] and [[Shoreditch]].
