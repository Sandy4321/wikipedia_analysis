'''Fran<U+00E7>ois Spoerry''' ([[Mulhouse]], 28 December 1912 - 11 January 1999) was a [[French people|French]] [[architecture|architect]].  He was born in Mulhouse to a large, industrious family.

After finishing school, Spoerry began his training as an architect at [[Strasbourg]] in 1930.  He became assistant to [[Jacques Cou<U+00EB>lle]] between 1932 and 1934 before graduating from the [[<U+00C9>cole des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Marseille]] in 1943 . During the [[World War II]], he was arrested and deported to [[Buchenwald]] and [[Dachau]]. 

After the war, he opened his first architectural firm in Mulhouse where he associated with a significant number of reconstruction projects. Here he was the planner of the new downtown.  He also built here the Tour of Europe, the largest structure in contemporary France whose top floor was a revolving restaurant. He also built several residential structures, including  Wilson Tower (highest building in the city after the Tour of Europe), the Residence Clemenceau. Residence Pierrefontaine, and others. What is most significance about the work of Spoerry is that he broke with the first principles of Planning [[Congr<U+00E8>s International d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM]] while rediscovering the principles of a dense urbanism.
