"'''Doll Parts'''" is a song by American [[alternative rock]] band [[Hole (band)|Hole]], written by vocalist and rhythm guitarist [[Courtney Love]]. The song was released as the band's sixth single and second from their second studio album, ''[[Live Through This]]'', in November 1994 to accompany the band's North American tour. It was also the first single to be released following the death of bassist [[Kristen Pfaff]] in June 1994.

Courtney Love wrote the song in the fall of 1991 soon after she met [[Kurt Cobain]], and has admitted that its lyrics were about her insecurity of his romantic interest in her.<ref name="boston" /> It went on to become one of the band's most popular songs, peaking on the US [[Billboard Modern Rock Tracks]] at number 4, and is considered by fans and critics alike as one of Hole's signature tracks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hole - Live Through This (album review) |url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/10034/Hole-Live-Through-This/|publisher=[http://www.sputnikmusic.com/ Sputnikmusic]|date=November 21, 2006|accessdate=December 11, 2010}}</ref>

==Origin and recording==
Courtney Love is known to have written "Doll Parts" as early as November 1991, performing it acoustically at a Hole concert in [[Massachusetts]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Holelive.com - The Ultimate Hole Trading Community|url=http://holelive.com/show.php?id=76|year=2010|publisher=[http://holelive.com/ Holelive.com]|accessdate=December 11, 2010}}</ref> under the working title "I Am." The song developed into its final form less than two weeks later and became a regular number on setlists during the band's tour of Europe the United Kingdom the following month. Journalist [[Everett True]] also noted that Love performed an acoustic version of the song to him over a telephone at 4 a.m. during the band's tour.<ref>{{cite book |title=Nirvana: The True Story |last=True |first=Everett |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=Omnibus Press |location= |isbn=1-84449-640-6 |page=317 |pages= |url= |accessdate=December 11, 2010}}</ref>

The first known studio version of "Doll Parts" was recorded on November 19, 1991 at [[Maida Vale Studios]] as part of Hole's first radio session with [[BBC]] DJ [[John Peel]].<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC - Radio 1 - Keeping It Peel - 19/11/1991 Hole|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/1990s/1991/Nov19hole/|date=October 2005|publisher=[[BBC Radio 1]]|accessdate=December 11, 2010}}</ref> A second version of the song was recorded on March 27, 1993 with [[Mark Goodier]], another BBC radio host, during a short three-date tour of England. In October 1993, the band recorded the album version of the song as part of the ''Live Through This'' sessions at Triclops Studios in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].

==Composition and lyrics==
"Doll Parts" is known to deal with themes of love, rejection, and fear of unrequited romance. Speaking to ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' magazine in 2010, Love stated that it was "a song about Kurt (Cobain)."<ref name="boston">{{cite journal |last1=Love |first1=Courtney|last2=|first2= |year= |title= |journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] |volume= |issue=August 2010 |page=26 |publisher= |doi= |url= |accessdate=December 11, 2010 }}</ref>

In the 1990s, during an interview on the television show ''[[Rage (TV program)|Rage]]'', Love divulged that she had written the song while staying in Boston at Joyce Linehan's apartment<U+2014> <blockquote>I was really impressed [by Linehan]. She was a lower-level music executive and she had lots of matching [[The Body Shop|Body Shop]] shampoo and I'd never seen that before. And I thought 'one day I'll have enough money and all my cosmetics are gonna match'. I also thought that the guy I was going out with - who I later married [referring to Cobain]... and that wasn't the [[transvestite]] in Las Vegas the other time [referring to her short-lived marriage to James Moreland]... I thought that he didn't like me and that he liked this total poser idiot girl, so I wrote this song about him.<ref>{{cite book|title=1001 Songs|author=Creswell, Toby|page=579|publisher=Hardie Grant Publishing|isbn=978-1740664585}}</ref></blockquote> Love also said that the line "dog beg" was written into the first verse because there was a dog in the room with her begging for food.<ref name="boston" />

Both the title of the song and the lyrical meaning are inspired by an encounter Love had with [[Kurt Cobain]] in 1991 prior to their relationship and marriage. Love had sent Cobain "a heart-shaped box scented with perfume and inside a porcelain doll, three dried roses, a miniature teacup and shellac-covered seashells"<ref>{{cite book |title=Heavier Than Heaven |last=Cross |first=Charles R. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |location= |isbn=0-340-73939-8 |page=181 |pages= |url= |accessdate=December 11, 2010}}</ref> to apologize for their first meeting in May 1991, where Love infamously wrestled with Cobain. The box, purchased in an antique store in New Orleans, was later the influence for the Cobain-penned [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] song, "[[Heart-Shaped Box]]." The lyrics reflect Love's initial feelings about Cobain having felt rejected by his lack of communication, which is most accurately conveyed in the line: "he only loves those things because he loves to see them break."

{{listen|filename=Doll Parts.ogg|title="Doll Parts"|description=Love's distinctive vocals and simple composition are heavily conveyed in the album version of the song.|format=[[Ogg]]}}
After [[Death of Kurt Cobain|Cobain's death]] in April 1994, "Doll Parts" took on a more tragic meaning with Love giving anguished performances of the song on tour. Drummer [[Patty Schemel]] has said that "certain things would remind her, a lot of the time on-stage, and it would just come out. Certain lyrics had a lot more meaning."<ref>Schemel, Patty. Interview on ''Behind The Music: Courtney Love''. 2010. Retrieved December 11, 2010.</ref>

Musically, the song is composed of only three chords: A, Cmaj7, and G. In retrospect, Love noted the song's musical simplicity<U+2014> "I still don't understand why that one song with just three chords is such a big thing, but it's definitely got some good lyrics."<ref name="boston" /> On both ''Live Through This'' and the individual single, the song is credited on record as written by Hole as a band, however according to [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]]'s website, the official author is solely Courtney Love.<ref name="bmi">{{cite web|title=BMI Repertoire Search, BMI.com|url=http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&keyID=1935873&ShowNbr=0&ShowSeqNbr=0&querytype=WorkID|publisher=[[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]]|accessdate=April 8, 2010}}</ref>
