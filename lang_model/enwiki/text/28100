There are at least three Our Lady of Victory Roman Catholic churches in New York City. Brooklyn's appears to be the oldest both for the parish and architecture. [[Our Lady of Victory Church (Bronx, New York)|Bronx's "Victory"]] dedication origin is unclear but it is believed to celebrate the [[Battle of Lepanto]] (1571). That church is located at 1512 Webster Avenue, at East 171 Street, a block south of Claremont Parkway, [[Tremont, Bronx|Tremont]], [[Bronx, New York|Bronx]], and was designed by [[John Vredenburgh Van Pelt]]<ref name="NYBicen">{{Cite book
