'''"Tales from the Public Domain"''' is the fourteenth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' [[The Simpsons (season 13)|thirteenth season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on March 17, 2002. It is the third trilogy episode of the series, which had become annual since the [[The Simpsons (season 12)|twelfth season]]'s "[[Simpsons Tall Tales]]", consisting of three self-contained segments that are based on historical stories. The first segment puts [[Homer Simpson]] in the role of [[Homer]] in the ancient Greek [[epic poem]] ''[[Odyssey]]''. The second segment tells the story of [[Saint Joan of Arc]], and the third and final segment lampoons [[William Shakespeare]]'s tragedy ''[[Hamlet]]''.

The episode was written by [[Andrew Kreisberg]], Josh Lieb and [[Matt Warburton]], and [[Mike B. Anderson]] served as the director. Show runner and executive producer [[Al Jean]] stated that the episode was "very fun for the writers" to do because it "allow[ed] them to parody great works of literature." On the other hand, Anderson stated that the episode was "much harder" to direct than others because, like with ''[[Treehouse of Horror (series)|Treehouse of Horror]]'' episodes, the animators had to make as many character designs for one act as they would for one normal episode.

In its original American broadcast, the episode was seen by more than 4% of the population between ages 18 and 49. Following its release on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] however, the episode received mixed reviews from critics.
==Plot==
[[Homer Simpson|Homer]] is told that he has an overdue book from the library, which he checked out when [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] was a baby. He says that he had intended to read to Bart every day, but various things had gotten in his way. ("Mostly car-related," he remarks. "Piece of crap.") Before he returns it, he reads from the book, telling three stories.

===D'oh, Brother Where Art Thou?===
In this story, Homer is [[Odysseus]], and delivers the [[Priam|King of Troy]] ([[Ned Flanders]]) a [[Trojan horse]]. He and his crew, including [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]], [[Lenny Leonard|Lenny]], [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]], [[Professor Frink]] and [[Carl Carlson|Carl]], kill all of Troy's citizens and win. However, he refuses to [[Animal sacrifice|sacrifice]] a [[sheep]], angering the gods, [[Zeus]] ([[Mayor Quimby]]), [[Dionysus]] ([[Barney Gumble|Barney]]), and [[Poseidon]] ([[Captain Horatio McCallister|the Sea Captain]]). Dionysus tries to destroy Odysseus with a lightning bolt, but misses and instead destroys the island of [[Atlantis]]. Poseidon literally blows Odysseus and his crew to the [[Sirens]] ([[Bouvier sisters|Patty and Selma]]) and visit [[Circe]] ([[List of recurring characters from The Simpsons#Lindsey Naegle|Lindsey Naegle]]), who turns his crew into pigs, whom Odysseus eats. Circe orders Odysseus to go through [[Hades]], crossing the [[River Styx]] (which has the [[Styx (band)|Styx]] song, [[Lady (Styx song)|Lady]] playing during the crossing), in order to go home so he can see [[Penelope]] ([[Marge Simpson|Marge]]) and [[Telemachus]] ([[Bart Simpson|Bart]]). When he arrives back to Ithaca, he spears all of the suitors ([[Krusty the Klown]], [[Kirk Van Houten]], [[Groundskeeper Willie]], [[C. Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]], [[Disco Stu]], and [[Sideshow Mel]]) trying to please Penelope. Penelope decides to take him back, though he leaves to go to Moe's.

===Hot Child in the City===
[[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] is [[Joan of Arc]], who leads the [[France|French]] against the [[England|English]] in the [[Hundred Years' War]], which Homer implies was also called "Operation Speedy Resolution". Despite her family's concern, she joins the army, where she has new ideas about defeating the enemy.  She meets the King of France ([[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]]). During a battle, the English capture Joan and put her on trial. She is accused of [[witchcraft]], and sentenced to death. When Lisa claims that she was following God's will, [[Groundskeeper Willie]] reveals that he too was chosen by God, but to lead the English armies against the French. God's voice then excuses himself by revealing that the two were never supposed to meet.

As they read the end, Joan of Arc is being burnt at the stake. Shocked, Lisa asks Homer if she was really burned to death. Marge then interrupts, claiming that Joan of Arc was rescued by [[Lancelot|Sir Lancelot]], and they get married and live in a [[spacecraft|spaceship]]. She then rips out the last page and eats it, remarking that it is easier to chew than the video of ''[[Bambi]]''.

===Do the Bard, Man===
Bart is [[Prince Hamlet]] in this ''Simpsons'' version of [[William Shakespeare]]'s classic. His uncle [[King Claudius|Claudius]] ([[Moe Szyslak|Moe]]) marries [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]] (Marge) after killing [[King Hamlet]] (Homer) by way of poison. The King returns to his son as a ghost, telling him of the betrayal and requesting that his death be avenged. Prince Hamlet (Bart), with the help of a professional actor ([[Krusty]]), puts on a play to make Claudius reveal himself to be guilty; however, Hamlet's reaction leads everyone to believe that he is crazy, so [[Ophelia]] ([[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]) decides to "out-crazy" him by prancing around and singing a stupid song, eventually jumping out the window and into the moat where she drowns. Because Hamlet knows what he did, Claudius attempts to kill him. Hamlet, aiming to kill Claudius, accidentally kills [[Polonius]] ([[Chief Wiggum]]). His son, [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]] ([[Ralph Wiggum]]), proposes to duel Prince Hamlet for revenge. As his "practice stab," Laertes kills himself, and Hamlet proceeds to murder Claudius. [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern|Rosencarl and Guildenlenny]] ([[Carl Carlson|Carl]] and [[Lenny Leonard|Lenny]]), meanwhile, have been covered in poison and kill each other with a [[high five]]. Hamlet walks away to celebrate, but he slips on some blood and dies. Seeing a big mess she does not want to clean up, Gertrude commits suicide by hitting herself in the head with a mace.

Bart thinks ''Hamlet'' was boring despite every character dying, but Homer tells him that the story led to the film ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', and all the Simpsons dance to the [[Ghostbusters (song)|theme]].

==Production==
[[Image:Mike B. Anderson by Gage Skidmore.jpg|left|190px|thumb|[[Mike B. Anderson]] (pictured) directed the episode.]]
"Tales from the Public Domain" was directed by [[Mike B. Anderson]] and written by [[Andrew Kreisberg]], Josh Lieb and [[Matt Warburton]]. It originally aired on March 17, 2002 on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]]. "Tales from the Public Domain" is the third trilogy episode produced for the series, the other two being "[[Simpsons Bible Stories]]" from [[The Simpsons (season 10)|season 10]], and "[[Simpsons Tall Tales]]" from [[The Simpsons (season 12)|season 12]]. [[Al Jean]], the show runner for the episode, stated that trilogy episodes are "very fun for the writers" to do because it allows them to parody "great works of literature" and condense them into one act each.<ref name="Jean" />

Before writing the episode, the writers had decided that one of the segments would feature Lisa as the main character. According to Jean, the writers found it very difficult to find a historical story for Lisa because there are "so few [historical stories] that star women". They had the same problem when pitching stories for "Simpsons Tall Tales", in which they resorted to giving Lisa the role of "Connie Appleseed", a feminization of the historical figure [[Johnny Appleseed]]. The writers eventually settled on [[Saint Joan of Arc]].<ref name="Jean" /> According to the episode's supervising producer [[Don Payne (writer)|Don Payne]], Scottish actor [[David Tennant]] watched "Do the Bard, Man" along with the cast of ''[[Hamlet]]'' during their first rehearsal.<ref name="Payne">Payne, Don.

Commentary for "Tales from the Public Domain", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The segment has also been used in schools to teach students about Shakespeare<U+2019>s literary work.<ref name="Jean" />

In the DVD [[audio commentary]] for the episode, Anderson stated that trilogy episodes, like the ''[[Treehouse of Horror (series)|Treehouse of horror]]'' episodes, are "much harder" to direct than normal ones because the animators have to make as many designs for each act as they would for one normal episode. In the scene in which Joan gets torched by the British, Jean specifically ordered Anderson to "make sure she doesn't get burned," even though she was surrounded by flames.<ref name="Anderson" /> Jean explained in the commentary that, when [[Mike Scully]] was show runner for ''The Simpsons'', Jean learned that "people do not wanna see changes in [the characters'] basic design" when the character gets hurt. He added that, because the viewer is "so attached to the characters, [the viewers] don't wanna see... especially Lisa, get hurt in any way."<ref name="Jean" /> In order to make Homer's ghost in the third segment transparent, the animators had to "double expose" him; Homer's cels were first shot normally and then with a diminished opacity. In the first segment, clouds can be seen moving behind Zeus. The clouds were animated by airbrushing the cels and then moving them slowly in order to make it "look heavenly."<ref name="Anderson">Anderson, Mike B. (2010).

==Cultural references==

Each segment is based on and include references to historical stories; "D'oh Brother, Where Art Thou" takes its story from the ancient [[Greek]] [[epic poem]] the ''[[Odyssey]]'', "Hot Child in the City" is based on the life and legend of Saint Joan of Arc, a French peasant girl who, as a teenager, led the French army to several important victories during the [[Hundred Years' War]], and "Do the Bard, Man" spoofs [[William Shakespeare]]'s tragedy ''[[Hamlet]]''.<ref name="Jean" />

The song that the sirens are singing in the first segment is a parody on the 1978 disco song [[Copacabana (song)|Copacabana]] by [[Barry Manilow]].<ref name="Long">Long, Tim. (2010). Commentary for "Tales from the Public Domain", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> In order to return to Ithaca, Homer crosses the river Styx, in which the dead can be seen dancing to rock music of the band with the [[Styx (band)|same name]]. In the second segment, the captain resembling Chief Wiggum is initially leading the French army. The soldier resembling Lou points out that the captain "keeps switching back from French and English." The scene satirizes films like ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' in which the Russians speak with a British accent even though they are in Russia. At the end of the act, Marge can be seen eating the page which shows Joan's demise and, say "Well, it's easier to chew than that ''[[Bambi]]'' video." The scene is a reference to a scene in the Disney film ''Bambi'', in which Bambi's mother is shot to death by hunters.<ref name="Jean">Jean, Al. (2010).

In the beginning of the third act, Bart argues that modern writers like [[Steven Bochco]], one of the creators of the television series ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', are more talented than Shakespeare. Bochco saw the episode with his children and was so flattered that he sent the ''Simpons'' staff some ''NYPD Blue'' merchandise.<ref name="Jean" /> After the ghost of Homer has spoken to Bart, he leaves Bart's room by flying through the wall, causing slime to appear on the wall. This is a reference to Slimer, a ghost from the ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' franchise who has a similar function.<ref name="Selman">Selman, Matt. (2010).

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast on March 17, 2002, "Tales from the Public Domain", along with a new episode of ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', received more than a full rating point more than [[ABC]]'s showing of the film ''[[Snow White: The Fairest of Them All]]'', which received a 3.1 rating among adults between ages 18 and 49, according to [[Nielsen Media Research]]. This means that the episode was watched by more than 4% of the American population of said demographic at the time of its broadcast.<ref name=medialife>{{cite web|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2002/mar02/mar18/2_tues/news7tuesday.html|title=Longer 'Fear Factor' takes 18-49s|publisher=''Media Life''|date=March 19, 2001|accessdate=April 4, 2011}}</ref> On August 24, 2010, the episode was released as part of ''The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season'' on DVD and Blu-ray.<ref name="DVDmg">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonthirteen.shtml |title=<nowiki>The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season [Blu-Ray] (2001)</nowiki> |date=September 2, 2010 |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |last=Jacobsson|first=Colin|publisher=DVD Movie Guide}}</ref>
