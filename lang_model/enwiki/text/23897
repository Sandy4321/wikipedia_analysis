'''John Sidney McCain III''' (born [[August 29]] [[1936]]) is the [[senior senator|senior]] [[United States]] [[United States Senator|Senator]] from [[Arizona]] and <!-- please see editor comment above! --> [[Presumptive nominee|presumptive]] <!-- please see editor comment above! --> [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nominee for [[President of the United States]] in the upcoming [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 election]].

[[John S. McCain, Sr.|McCain's grandfather]] and [[John S. McCain, Jr.|father]] were the first pair of father/son Four-Star [[Admiral (United States)|admirals]] in the [[United States Navy]]. McCain graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1958. He became a [[naval aviator]], flying [[attack aircraft]] from [[aircraft carrier|carriers]]. During the [[Vietnam War]] in 1967, he narrowly escaped death in the [[1967 USS Forrestal fire|''Forrestal'' fire]]. On his 23rd bombing mission over [[North Vietnam]] later in 1967, he was shot down, badly injured, and captured as a [[prisoner of war]] by the North Vietnamese. He spent five and a half years as a prisoner of war, including periods of [[torture]], before he was released in accordance with the [[Paris Peace Accords]] in 1973.

McCain retired from the Navy in 1981 and was elected to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from [[Arizona's 1st congressional district]] in 1982. After serving two terms, he was elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in 1986, winning reelection in 1992, 1998, and 2004. While generally adhering to [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] principles, McCain has established a reputation as a political maverick for his willingness to disagree with his party on several key issues. Surviving the [[Keating Five]] scandal of the 1980s, he made [[campaign finance reform]] one of his signature concerns, eventually co-sponsoring the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] in 2002. 

McCain lost the Republican nomination in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]] to [[George W. Bush]] after closely contested battles in several early primary states. In the 2008 presidential election cycle, McCain staged a comeback after his campaign stumbled in mid-2007, and by the end of [[January 2008]], he was the Republican front-runner once again. Following victories in early February and the withdrawal of his closest [[United States Republican presidential candidates, 2008|competitors]], McCain gained enough [[delegate]]s to solidify his status as the presumptive nominee on [[March 4]], [[2008]].

''[[Arizona Republic]]'' columnist and [[RealClearPolitics]] contributor Robert Robb, using a formulation devised by [[William F.
