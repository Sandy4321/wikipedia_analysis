'''Okra''' ([[American English]]: {{IPA|[<U+02C8>o<U+028A>k<U+0279><U+0259>]}}, [[British English]] {{IPA|[<U+02C8><U+0259><U+028A>k<U+0279><U+0259>], [<U+02C8><U+0252>k<U+0279><U+0259>]}}), also known as '''lady's finger'''<ref name="websters">[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/okra], Webster's Online Dictionary: Okra. Rerieved [[2006-09-23]].</ref>, '''bhindi''' and '''gumbo''', is a [[flowering plant]] in the [[mallow]] (along with such species as [[cotton]] and [[cocoa]]) family valued for its edible green fruits. Its [[binomial nomenclature|scientific name]] is '''''Abelmoschus esculentus'''''. The species is an [[annual plant|annual]] or [[perennial plant|perennial]], growing to 2 m tall. The [[leaf|leaves]] are 10<U+2013>20 cm long and broad, palmately lobed with 5<U+2013>7 lobes. The [[flower]]s are 4<U+2013>8 cm diameter, with five white to yellow petals, often with a red or purple spot at the base of each petal. The [[fruit]] is a capsule up to 18 cm long in maximum, containing numerous [[seed]]s.

== Etymology, origin and distribution ==
The name "okra" is of [[West African]] origin and is cognate with "{{lang|ig|<U+1ECD><U+0301>k<U+1EE5><U+0300>r<U+1EE5><U+0300>}}" in [[Igbo language|Igbo]], a language spoken in [[Nigeria]]. In various [[Bantu languages]], okra is called "kingombo" or a variant thereof, and this is the origin of its name in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]]. The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] "{{ArabDIN|b<U+0101>myah}}" is the basis of the names in the [[Middle East]], the [[Balkans]], [[Turkey]], [[North Africa]] and [[Russia]]. In [[Southern Asia]], its name is usually a variant of "bhindi".

[[Image:Abelmoschus esculentus (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Okra flower bud and immature seed pod]]
Okra is occasionally referred to by an early, now incorrect [[synonym]], ''Hibiscus esculentus'' L. The species apparently originated in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], though the manner of distribution from there is undocumented.  The [[Egypt]]ians and [[Moor]]s of the 12th and 13th centuries used the [[Arab language|Arab]] word for the plant, suggesting that it had come from the east.  The plant may thus have been taken across the [[Red Sea]] or the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] strait to the [[Arabian Peninsula]], rather than north across the [[Sahara]].  One of the earliest accounts is by a Spanish Moor who visited Egypt in 1216, who described the plant under cultivation by the locals who ate the tender, young pods with [[flour|meal]].<ref name=tamu>[http://plantanswers.tamu.edu/publications/vegetabletravelers/okra.html "Okra, or 'Gumbo,' from Africa], tamu.edu</ref>

From Arabia, the plant spread around the shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and eastward.  The lack of a word for okra in the ancient languages of [[India]] suggests that it arrived there after the beginning of the [[Common Era]].  The plant was introduced to the [[Americas]] by ships plying the [[Atlantic slave trade]]<ref>[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=23877&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html " Okra gumbo and rice"] by  Sheila S. Walker, ''[[The News Courier]]'', unknown date</ref> by 1658, when its presence was recorded in [[Brazil]].  It was further documented in [[Suriname]] in 1686.  Okra may have been introduced to the southeastern [[North America]] in the early 18th century and gradually spread.  It was being grown as far north as [[Philadelphia]] by 1748, while [[Thomas Jefferson]] noted that it was well established in [[Virginia]] by 1781.  It was commonplace throughout the southern [[United States]] by 1800 and the first mention of different [[cultivar]]s was in 1806.<ref name=tamu/>

''Abelmoschus esculentus'' is cultivated throughout the tropical and warm temperate regions of the world for its fibrous fruits or pods containing round, white seeds. The fruits are harvested when immature and eaten as a [[vegetable]]. 

[[Image:Bucket of raw okra pods.jpg|thumb|Okra fruits used as a vegetable]]
In [[Iran]], [[Egypt]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Iraq]], [[Greece]], [[Turkey]] and other parts of the eastern [[Mediterranean]], okra is widely used in a thick stew made with vegetables and meat. In [[Indian cuisine|Indian cooking]], it is sauteed or added to gravy-based preparations and is very popular in South India. It became a popular vegetable in [[Japanese cuisine]] towards the end of the 20th century, served with [[soy sauce]] and ''[[katsuobushi]]'' or as [[tempura]]. It is used as a thickening agent in [[gumbo]]. Breaded, deep fried okra is served in the southern United States. The immature pods may also be pickled.

Okra leaves may be cooked in a similar manner as the greens of [[beet]]s or [[dandelion]]s.<ref>[http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_2718,00.html?rsrc=search Okra Greens and Corn Saute], recipe copyrighted to "c.1996, M.S. Milliken & S. Feniger", hosted by foodnetwork.com</ref>   The leaves are also eaten raw in salads.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}  Okra seeds may be roasted and ground to form a non-caffeinated substitute for [[coffee]].<ref name=tamu/>  As imports were disrupted by the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, the [[Austin State Gazette]] noted, "An acre of okra will produce seed enough to furnish a [[plantation]] of fifty [[negro]]es with coffee in every way equal to that imported from [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]]."<ref>Austin State Gazette [TEX.], [[November 9]], [[1861]], p. 4, c. 2, copied in [http://www.uttyler.edu/vbetts/coffee.htm ''Confederate Coffee Substitutes: Articles from Civil War Newspapers''], [[University of Texas at Tyler]]</ref>  

Okra forms part of several regional 'signature' dishes.  ''Frango com quiabo'' (chicken with okra) is a [[Brazilian cuisine|Brazilian dish]] that is especially famous in the region of [[Minas Gerais]].  [[Gumbo]], a hearty stew whose key ingredient is okra, is found throughout the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]].  The word "gumbo" is based on the [[Central Bantu]] word for okra, "kigombo", via the Caribbean Spanish "guingamb<U+00F3>" or "quimbomb<U+00F3>".<ref name=tamu/>  It is also an expected ingredient in [[callaloo]], a [[Caribbean]] dish and the national dish of Trinidad & Tobago.

Okra oil is a pressed [[vegetable oils|seed oil]], extracted from the seeds of the okra. The greenish yellow edible oil has a pleasant taste and odor, and is high in [[unsaturated fat]]s such as [[oleic acid]] and [[linoleic acid]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Okra, Potential Multiple-Purpose Crop for the Temperate Zones and Tropics|author=Franklin W. Martin|volume=36|date=1982|pages=340-345|journal=Economic Botany}}</ref> The oil content of the seed is quite high at about 40%. Oil yields from okra crops are also high. At 794 kg/ha, the yield was exceeded only by that of [[sunflower oil]] in one trial.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mays, D.A., W. Buchanan, B.N. Bradford, and P.M. Giordano|date=1990|title=Fuel production potential of several agricultural crops|pages=260-263|journal=Advances in new crops}}</ref>

Unspecified parts of the plant reportedly possess [[diuretic]] properties.<ref>Felter, Harvey Wickes & Lloyd, John Uri.

== Cultivation ==
[[Image:Two okra flowers.JPG|thumb|Okra flowers range from white to yellow]]
''Abelmoschus esculentus'' is among the most heat- and drought-tolerant vegetable species in the world. It will tolerate poor [[soil]]s with heavy [[clay]] and intermittent moisture. Severe frost can damage the pods.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

It is an annual crop in the southern United States.

In cultivation, the seeds are soaked overnight prior to planting to a depth of 1-2 cm. [[Germination]] occurs between six days (soaked seeds) and three weeks. Seedlings require ample water.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}  The seed pods rapidly become fibrous and woody and must be harvested within a week of the fruit being pollinated to be edible.<ref name=tamu/> 

The products of the plant are mucilaginous, resulting in the characteristic "goo" when the seed pods are cooked.  In order to avoid this effect, okra pods are often stir fried, so the moisture is cooked away, or paired with slightly acidic ingredients, such as citrus or tomatoes.  The cooked leaves are also a powerful soup thickener.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}
