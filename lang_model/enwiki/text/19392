'''Yukon''' is a city in [[Canadian County, Oklahoma|Canadian County]], [[Oklahoma]], [[United States]] and is part of the [[Oklahoma City Metroplex|Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area]].  The population was 22,709 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]].<ref name="c2010"/>  Founded in the 1890s, the town was named in reference to a [[gold rush]] in [[Yukon Territory]], [[Canada]], at the time. Historically, Yukon served as an urban center for area farmers and the site of a large [[milling (grinding)|milling]] operation. It is now considered primarily a bedroom community for people who work in Oklahoma City.

==History==
Yukon was founded by A.N. Spencer in 1891,<ref name="okhis">Savage, Cynthia, "[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/Y/YU002.html Yukon]," ''[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/ ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''. "Yukon."] (accessed May 4, 2010).</ref> and was named for the [[Yukon River]] in Alaska.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=16230|title= Profile for Yukon, Oklahoma, OK|publisher= ePodunk |accessdate= September 25, 2012}}</ref>

Spencer, a cattleman from [[Texas]] turned railroad builder, was working on a line from [[El Reno]] to [[Arkansas]] when he decided to build the town.<ref name="city">[http://www.ci.yukon.ok.us/about-yukon/ About Yukon], [http://www.ci.yukon.ok.us/ City of Yukon Website] (accessed May 4, 2010).</ref>  Spencer filed the plat on the townsite on February 14, 1891.<ref name="city"/> He had agreed to do so and lay the train tracks through the town in exchange for half of the lots, which were owned by Minnie Taylor and Luther S. Morrison.<ref name="okhis"/> Taylor and Morrison had acquired the land in the 1889 land run.<ref name="okhis"/> Spencer also bought two quarter sections south of Main Street from Joseph Carson and his sister, Josephine.<ref name="city"/>  Spencer and his brother, Lewis, named the town after the [[Yukon Territory]] of [[Canada]], where a [[gold rush]] was booming at the time.

The first houses and businesses were located on the north side of Spencer Avenue (now Main Street) and present Fourth and Fifth Streets.<ref name="city"/> The ''Canadian County Courier'' reported on April 1, 1891, that the city had 25 homes, one bank, two real estate offices, two restaurants, a lumber yard, a hardware store, a grocery, a livery stable, two saloons, a blacksmith shop, a printing office, a barber shop, and a second barber shop "about completed."<ref name="city"/>

The Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railway Company laid its track, causing the abandonment of Frisco, which had a population of 1,000 at the time.<ref name="okhis"/> Beginning in about 1898, Yukon began to attract immigrants from Bohemia. Following World War I and the dissolution of [[Bohemia]] into [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Moravia]], the immigrants became known as "[[Czechs]]."<ref name="okhis"/> Yukon is known as the "Czech Capital of Oklahoma."<ref name="okhis"/>

The town voted to incorporate in 1901<ref name="Yukon Oklahoma">{{cite web|url= http://www.city-data.com/city/Yukon-Oklahoma.html|title= Yukon Oklahoma|publisher= City-Data.com |accessdate= September 25, 2012}}</ref> and voted to add water works, sewer, and electricity from the mill in 1910.<ref name="city"/> Businesses remained clustered on Main Street between Fourth and Fifth, until the 1920s, when they began to locate in other parts of the town.<ref name="city"/> The interurban was built from [[Oklahoma City]] to [[El Reno]] in 1911.<ref name="city"/> It closed in 1940.<ref name="city"/> Paved roads didn't arrive until the construction of [[State Highway 66]] in 1926.<ref name="city"/>

Yukon thrived as the urban center for area farmers and had an organized library by 1905 and a dedicated library building in 1927.<ref name="okhis"/> A small milling operation, the Yukon Mill and Grain Company, opened in 1893 and grew to shipping flour and feeds throughout the south and exporting them overseas by 1915.<ref name="city"/> The milling operation was owned by the Kroutil and Dobry families, but the Dobry family built their own mill and parted ways with the Kroutils in the 1930s.<ref name="city"/> The mills were sold to larger corporations; Shawnee Mills purchased the Yukon Mill and Grain Company and Mid-Continent purchased the Dobry Mills.<ref name="okhis"/> Paying homage to that history, the students of [[Yukon High School]] are known as "Millers," and their mascot is "The Miller Man."

In 1949, Yukon garnered national media attention because of the plight of [[Grady the Cow]].

From a population of 830 in 1907, Yukon grew to 1,990 by 1950.<ref name="okhis"/> By 1960, the population registered at 3,076.<ref name="okhis"/> Oklahoma City annexed nearly all of the land around Yukon during the 1960s. This brought a boom in residential construction and commercial development. The town had grown to approximately 22,000 residents in 2005.<ref name="city"/>
