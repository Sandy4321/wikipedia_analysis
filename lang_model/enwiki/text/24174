Vos won the junior road race world title, with Van Dijk finishing third. In 2005, Van Dijk again won the Dutch national junior title in the individual time trial but finished second in the road race, again behind Vos.<ref name="cyclingarchives" />  In 2007, when Van Dijk was considered for selection in regional speed skating, she had to choose between speed skating and cycling&ndash; ultimately, she chose cycling.<ref name="biography" />

[[File:Ellen van Dijk in regenboogtrui.png|right|thumb|Van Dijk wearing the [[rainbow jersey]] during a scratch race.]]
Due to her good results at the national track cycling championships, Van Dijk was able to ride the individual pursuit in the remaining two (out of four) [[2007<U+2013>2008 UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|2007<U+2013>2008 track cycling World Cups]], where she could, via the [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]] World Ranking system, potentially earn qualification for the [[2008 Olympic Games]]. She finished in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Copenhagen]] in fifth and fourth places respectively. After finishing fifth in the [[2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships <U+2013> Women's individual pursuit|individual pursuit]] at the [[2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships|World Track Championships]] in [[Manchester]], Van Dijk missed out on qualification for the Olympic games; she finished 12th in the UCI World Rankings and only the first eleven riders qualified.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ellen van Dijk in tranen|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1018/Wielrennen/article/detail/2163365/2008/03/27/Ellen-van-Dijk-is-in-tranen.dhtml|publisher=[[Algemeen Dagblad]]|date=27 March 2007|accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref> The day after her failure to qualify was confirmed, Van Dijk responded by winning [[2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships <U+2013> Women's scratch|the scratch race at the 2008 World Cycling Championships]].

;2009
On the track, Van Dijk followed other competitors by riding with a heavier gear.<ref name="volkskrant" >{{cite news|title=Van Dijk schiet niets op vindt ze zelf|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2698/Sport/article/detail/320234/2009/03/25/Van-Dijk-schiet-niets-op-vindt-ze-zelf.dhtml|author=Mark Mis<U+00E9>rus|publisher=[[de Volkskrant]]|date=25 March 2009|accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref> The change seemed to bear fruit when, in February at the [[2008<U+2013>2009 UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|2008<U+2013>2009 Track Cycling World Cup]] in [[Copenhagen]], she won her first two World Cup victories in the individual pursuit and points race and won a silver medal in the [[team pursuit]]. A month later at the [[2009 UCI Track Cycling World Championships]] in [[Pruszk<U+00F3>w]], [[Poland]], she failed to live up to her billing as world champion and her performances were not as good as those than in Copenhagen in February and in Manchester the year before. Indeed, Van Dijk did not reach the podium in any event.<ref name="volkskrant" /> In spite of her disappointing performance in Pruszk<U+00F3>w, Van Dijk was approached by, and soon agreed to join, the professional road [[cycling team]] {{ct|TCW|2009a}}.
