'''Antiscience''' is a position critical of [[science]] and the [[scientific method]]. Antiscientific views generally claim that science is non-[[Objectivity (science)|objective]] method generating non-[[universality|universal]] knowledge, and that scientific [[reductionism]] is flawed.  Antiscience criticises the perceived power and influence of science, and objects to what proponents perceive as an arrogant or closed-minded attitude amongst scientists.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} ''Antiscience'' has been used to refer to both the [[New Age]] and [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] movements associated with the [[Left-wing politics|political Left]], and to [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] and [[religious fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] movements associated with the [[Right-wing politics|political Right]].

==History==
Those involved in the beginnings of the [[scientific revolution]] such as [[Robert Boyle]] found themselves in immediate and direct confrontation with those such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] who were extremely skeptical regarding whether what we now think of as the scientific method was a satisfactory way to obtain genuine knowledge of the nature of the world. Hobbes' stance is today seen by many as an anti-science position.

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], in ''[[Discourse on the Arts and Sciences]]'', is noted for claiming science leads to [[Immorality|morality's corruption]]. 

Anti-science issues are seen as a fundamental consideration in the transition from 'pre-science' or '[[proto-science]]' such as that evident in [[Alchemy]]. Many disciplines which pre-date the widespread adoption and acceptance of the scientific method, such as [[geometry]] and [[astronomy]], are not seen as anti-science.

Nonetheless, some of the orthodoxies within those disciplines which pre-date a scientific approach (such as those orthodoxies repudiated by the discoveries of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]) are seen as being a product of an anti-science stance.

The term '[[scientism]]' is sometimes used as a pejorative description, in the sense that individuals to whom this is attributed are claimed to be '[[Fetishism|fetishizing]]' science, or treating science in a similar way to a religion. 

The term [[reductionism]] is occasionally used in a similarly pejorative way (as a somewhat more subtle attack on scientists) although scientists can now be found who recognise the conceptual and philosophical shortcomings of reductionism but feel nonetheless comfortable in being labelled as reductionists.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

[[William Blake]] in his paintings and writings, reacted strongly against the work of [[Isaac Newton]] and is seen as being perhaps the earliest (and almost certainly the most prominent and enduring) example of what is seen by historians as being the [[aesthetic]] anti-science response.

==Political antiscience==
===Left-wing antiscience===
One way the antiscience view is expressed is in the "denial of [[universality]] and... legitimisation of alternatives,"<ref name="Robsville">[http://home.btclick.com/scimah/postmodernism.htm Sean Robsville "Postmodernism - a threat to Buddhism?": Personal website]</ref> and that "the results of scientific findings [do]... not represent any underlying reality, but are purely the ideology of dominant groups within society."<ref name="Robsville" />

In this view, science is associated with the political Right and is seen as a belief system that is deeply conservative and conformist, that suppresses [[innovation]], that resists change and that acts dictatorially. This includes the view, for example, that science has a "[[bourgeois]] and/or [[Eurocentric]] and/or masculinist world-view... and [that] various ethnic groups... would have to develop their own forms of science which need not be as intellectually demanding as the Western male variety."<ref name="Robsville" />

===Right-wing antiscience===
In this context, antiscience may be considered dependent on established moral and cultural arguments. There are many modern examples of conservative antiscience, primary among these are arguments against [[stem cell research]], [[abortion]], [[evolutionary theory]], and [[environmental protection]] issues such as [[global warming]]. As the basis for any particular conclusion, an individual who holds these beliefs may cite ethical/religious/economic concerns; in comparison to liberal views, which pronounce human rights, women's rights, and altogether more [[libertarian]] perspectives, as those issues which deserve primary attention.

====Religious antiscience====

{{main|Relationship between religion and science}}

A frequent basis of antiscientific views is literalist or fundamentalist [[theism]]. Here, any scientific findings that conflict with what is seen as traditional divinely-inspired knowledge are regarded as flawed. Over the centuries such conservative thinkers have opposed such ideas as [[heliocentrism]], [[Planetary orbit|planetary motion]] and, more recently, the theory of [[evolution]].

In the modern world, major theistic conflict still exists in the area of evolution, with schools of thought as [[creationism]] and its offshoot [[intelligent design]] remaining popular beliefs.<ref>Jon D. Miller, Eugenie C. Scott, Shinji Okamoto ''Public Acceptance of Evolution'' Science 11 August 2006: Vol. 313. no. 5788, pp. 765 - 766</ref>

== Three areas of antiscience ==
Historically, antiscience first arose as a reaction against scientific materialism. The 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] had ushered in "the ideal of a unified system of all the sciences,"<ref name="Berlin">Isaiah Berlin, The Proper Study of Mankind, London: Pimlico, 1997, p328</ref> but there were those fearful of this notion, who "felt that constrictions of reason and science, of a single all-embracing system... were in some way constricting, an obstacle to their vision of the world, chains on their imagination or feeling."<ref name="Berlin" /> Antiscience then is a rejection of "the scientific model [or paradigm]... with its strong implication that only that which was quantifiable, or at any rate, measurable... was real."<ref name="Berlin" /> In this sense, it comprises a "critical attack upon the total claim of the new scientific method to dominate the entire field of human knowledge."<ref name="Berlin" />

Three major areas of antiscience can be seen in philosophy, sociology and ecology. The following quotes explore this aspect of the subject.

=== Philosophy ===
Philosophical objections against science are often objections about the role of reductionism. For example, in the field of psychology, "both reductionists and antireductionists accept that... non-molecular explanations may not be improved, corrected or grounded in molecular ones."
<ref>[http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/PHILSCI/journal/issues/v72n1/720114/brief/720114.abstract.html Alex Rosenberg and D. M. Kaplan "How to Reconcile Physicalism and Antireductionism about Biology" ''Philosophy of Science'' 72 (January 2005) pp. 43-68]</ref> Further, "epistemological antireductionism holds that, given our finite mental capacities, we would not be able to grasp the ultimate physical explanation of many complex phenomena even if we knew the laws governing their ultimate
constituents."<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=9653712&dopt=Abstract Nagel T. "Reductionism and antireductionism." Novartis Found Symp. 1998;213:3-10; discussion 10-4, 73-5.]</ref> Some see antiscience as "common...in academic settings...many people confuse science, scientism and pseudoscience, resulting in an antiscience stance. Some argue that nothing can be known for sure." <ref>[http://alliance1.org/Conferences/NLCCWI2006post/materials/80-4Gambrill.pdf Eileen Gambrill, Evidence based practice, an alternative to authority based practice, Families in Society, the Journal of Contemporary Human Services, 80.4, 1999, 341-350]</ref>

Many scholars are "divided as to whether reduction should be a central strategy for understanding the world."<ref name="ToddJones">[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9973.2004.00341.x?journalCode=meta Todd Jones, Reductionism and Antireductionism: Rights and Wrongs, Metaphilosophy, Volume 35, Number 5, October 2004, pp. 614-647]</ref> However, many agree that "there are, nevertheless, reasons why we want science to discover properties and explanations other than reductive physical ones." <ref name="ToddJones" /> Such issues stem "from an antireductionist worry that there is no absolute conception of reality, that is, a characterization of reality such as... science claims to provide." <ref>[http://www.csupomona.edu/~pwross/Sensibility%20Theory%20and%20Conservative%20Complacency.DOC Peter W. Ross and Dale Turner, "Sensibility Theory and Conservative Complacency"]</ref> This is close to the Kantian view that reality is ultimately unknowable and all models are just imperfect approximations to it.

=== Sociology ===
Sociologist Thomas Gieryn refers to "some sociologists who might appear to be antiscience."<ref name="Gieryn">[http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ISIS/journal/issues/v93n3/930310090/930310090.html Thomas F. Gieryn, Book Review of John Ziman. Real Science: What it is and What it Means, Cambridge: Cambridge, University Press, 2000, Isis, vol. 93 (2002), pp. 544<U+2013>545]</ref> Some "philosophers and antiscience types," he contends, may have presented "unreal images of science that threaten the believability of scientific knowledge,"<ref name="Gieryn" /> or appear to have gone "too far in their antiscience deconstructions."<ref name="Gieryn" /> The question often lies in how far scientists can be said to really conform to the standard stereotype of "communalism, universalism, disinterestedness, originality, and... skepticism."<ref name="Gieryn" /> Unfortunately, "scientists don't always conform... scientists do get passionate about pet theories; they do rely on reputation in judging a scientist's work; they do pursue fame and gain via research."<ref name="Gieryn" /> Thus, they do show inherent biases in their work. Many "scientists are not as rational and logical as the legend would have them, nor are they as illogical or irrational as some relativists might say."<ref name="Gieryn" />.

=== Ecology and health sphere ===
Within the ecological and health spheres, Levins identifies a conflict "not between science and antiscience, but rather between different pathways for science and technology; between a commodified science-for-profit and a gentle science for humane goals; between the sciences of the smallest parts and the sciences of dynamic wholes... [he] offers proposals for a more holistic, integral approach to understanding and addressing environmental issues." <ref>Richard Levins, Whose Scientific Method? Scientific Methods for a Complex World, New Solutions: ''A Journal of Environmental and Occupational Health Policy'',Vol.13,3, 2003, 261-274</ref> These beliefs are also common within the scientific community, with for example, scientists being prominent in environmental campaigns warning of environmental dangers such as [[ozone depletion]] and the [[greenhouse effect]]. It can also be argued that this version of antiscience comes close to that found in the medical sphere where patients and practitioners may choose to reject reductionism and adopt a more holistic approach to health problems. This can be both a practical and a conceptual shift and has attracted strong criticism: "therapeutic touch, a healing technique based upon the laying-on of hands, has found wide acceptance in the nursing profession despite its lack of scientific plausibility. Its acceptance is indicative of a broad antiscientific trend in nursing." <ref name="Glazer">[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1466-769X.2000.00061.x?cookieSet=1&journalCode=nup Sarah Glazer, "Therapeutic touch and postmodernism in nursing", Nursing Philosophy (2001) 2(3), 196-212.]</ref> 

Glazer also criticises the therapists and patients, "for abandoning the biological underpinnings of nursing and for misreading philosophy in the service of an antiscientific world-view".<ref name="Glazer" /> 
Brian Martin provides a view of the conflict between science and antiscience: "Gross and Levitt's basic approach is to attack constructivists for not being positivists."<ref name="Martin">[http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/96sss1.html Brian Martin, Social Construction of an 'Attack on Science', ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 26, No. 1, February 1996, pp. 161-173.]</ref> Science is "presented as a unitary object, usually identified with scientific knowledge. It is portrayed as neutral and objective. Second, science is claimed to be under attack by 'antiscience' which is composed essentially of ideologues who are threats to the neutrality and objectivity that are fundamental to science. Third, a highly selective attack is made on the arguments of 'antiscience'."<ref name="Martin" /> Such people allegedly then "routinely equate critique of scientific knowledge with hostility to science, a jump that is logically unsupportable and empirically dubious."<ref name="Martin" /> Having then "constructed two artificial entities, a unitary 'science' and a unitary 'academic left', each reduced to epistemological essences, Gross and Levitt proceed to attack. They pick out figures in each of several areas -- science studies, postmodernism, feminism, environmentalism, AIDS activism -- and criticise their critiques of science."<ref name="Martin" />

The writings of Young serve to illustrate more rhetorical antiscience outpourings: "The strength of the antiscience movement and of alternative technology is that their advocates have managed to retain Utopian vision while still trying to create concrete instances of it."<ref name="Young">[http://human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/sisr1.html Robert M. Young, Science is Social Relations]</ref> "the real social, ideological and economic forces shaping science...[have] been opposed to the point of suppression in many quarters. Most scientists hate it and label it 'antiscience'. But it is urgently needed, because it makes science self-conscious and hopefully self-critical and accountable with respect to the forces which shape research priorities, criteria, goals."<ref name="Young" />

==Opposition to reductionism and positivism==

=== Failure to appreciate subtle complexity === 
The formulas of mathematical models are "artificial constructions, logical figments with no necessary relation to the outside world." [Berlin, 2000, 123]. These models always "leave out the richest and most important part of human experience...daily life, history, human laws and institutions, the modes of human self- expression." [Berlin, 2000, 110] A failure to appreciate the subtle complexity of social worlds, means they get excluded from the formulas, even though, <U+201C>no easy reductionism will do justice to the material.<U+201D> [Coleman] This approach often fails to concentrate <U+201C>on social structures, processes, and actions in a specific sense (inequality, mobility, classes, strata, ethnicity, gender relations, urbanization, work and life of different types of people, not just elites),<U+201D> [Kocka] and so tends to generate mostly meaningless oversimplifications.

=== From reductionism to positivism ===
This basically comes down to the issue of positivism, which is "the view that all true knowledge is scientific," [Bullock & Trombley] and that all things are ultimately measurable. 

Because of its "close association with reductionism," [ibid] it is worth saying that positivism and reductionism involve the view that "entities of one kind...are reducible to entities of another," [ibid] such as societies to numbers, or mental events to chemical events. It also involves the contention that "processes are reducible to physiological, physical or chemical events," [ibid] and even that "social processes are reducible to relationships between and actions of individuals," [ibid] or that "biological organisms are reducible to physical systems." [ibid]
