==History==

The church was built in 1845, replacing an earlier church, and re-using some of its fabric.<ref name=nhl/>  The interior was reordered in 1893 by the [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] firm of architects, [[Sharpe, Paley and Austin#Paley, Austin and Paley|Paley, Austin and Paley]].<ref> {{Citation | last = Brandwood| first = Geoff| author-link = | last2 = Austin| first2 = Tim| last3 = Hughes| first3 = John| last4 = Price| first4 = James| publication-date = | date = | year = 2012| title = The Architecture of Sharpe, Paley and Austin| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = Swindon| place = | publisher = [[English Heritage]]| pages = | page = 240| format = | id = | isbn = 978-1-84802-049-8| doi = | oclc = | url = | accessdate =}}</ref>  Some of the fittings currently present in the church result from this reordering.<ref name=nhl/>

==Architecture==

St John's is constructed in [[slate]] and [[igneous rock]], with some [[galleting]].  It is roofed with green slate.  The plan is simple, consisting of a six-[[bay (architecture)|bay]] [[nave]] and [[chancel]] in one range, a small west tower, and a north porch.  The windows along the sides of the church have two lights, and the east window has three lights.  The tower has twin bell openings, and a [[battlement]]ed [[parapet]].<ref name=nhl/>

Inside the church is an open timber roof.<ref name=nhl/>  The altar was designed by [[George Gilbert Scott]], and was moved here from [[Crosthwaite Parish Church]] in 1848.<ref name=pev> {{Citation | last =Hyde| first =Matthew| authorlink = | last2 = Pevsner | first2 = Nikolaus | author2-link =Nikolaus Pevsner| series= The Buildings of England| title =Cumbria |edition= | publisher =[[Yale University Press]] | year =2010 | origyear=1967 | location = New Haven and London| page = 601| url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-300-12663-1}}</ref>  Panelling in the church, formerly from [[box pew]]s in Crosthwaite Church, was moved here in 1893.  The [[pulpit]], its [[sounding board]], and the [[sanctuary#sanctuary as a sacred place|sanctuary]] rails date from the 18th&nbsp;century, and also came from another church.  Also in the church are carved [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Royal arms]] of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], and memorial tablets dated 1774 and 1853.<ref name=nhl/>  The stained glass in the east window dates from 1895 and was made by [[Shrigley and Hunt]]<ref name=pev/>
