"'''Dress You Up'''" is a song written by Andrea LaRusso and Peggy Stanziale, and performed by American entertainer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].  It was released as the final single from her second studio album, ''[[Like a Virgin]]'', on July 24, 1985, by [[Sire Records]]. The song was the last track to be added to the album as it was submitted late by songwriters Andrea LaRusso and Peggy Stanziale. Madonna pushed for the song's inclusion on ''Like a Virgin'' as she particularly liked its lyrics. Musically, the song is a drum beat driven dance track featuring instrumentation from guitars and vocals from a choir. The lyrics are an extended metaphor for fashion and sex, comparing dressing up with passion. A live performance from Madonna's [[The Virgin Tour|first tour]] was used as the music video.

Critics reacted positively to the dance-pop nature of the track. "Dress You Up" became Madonna's sixth consecutive top-five single in the United States. It also reached the top-ten in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The song was most recently performed on the 2009 leg of the [[Sticky & Sweet Tour]]. "Dress You Up" was added to the "Filthy Fifteen" list of the [[Parents Music Resource Center]], due to the perceived sexual nature of its lyrics. The song has been covered in different forms by a number of artists.

== Background and release ==

"Dress You Up" was the last song to be included on the ''Like a Virgin'' album. [[record producer|Producer]] [[Nile Rodgers]] had initially asked songwriters Andrea LaRusso and Peggy Stanziale to write a [[chic (style)|chic-styled]] song for Madonna.<ref>{{harvnb|Bego|2000|p=34}}</ref> However, the writing took time, since both LaRusso and Stanziale were busy with other projects.<ref name="rikky">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=19}}</ref> When the lyrics of the song was submitted, Rodgers rejected it as there was no time to compose a melody and record it for the album. But Madonna liked the lyrics of the song, and persuaded Rodgers to include it on ''Like a Virgin''.<ref name="rikky"/> In Britain, the song was released as a limited-edition shaped picture disc. In this case, it was star-shaped to tie in with the Christmas release date for the single.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|others=Madonna |title="Dress You Up" |type=12-inch single <U+2013> Picture disc |year=1985|publisher= Warner Bros.

"Dress You Up" is a characteristic [[drum machine]] driven dance track and consists of a two-chord [[Song structure (popular music)|verse]]. The [[chorus effect|chorus]] is supported by vocals from a [[choir]], a four-chord progression and a single guitar note, played by Rodgers.<ref name="rikky2">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=20}}</ref> A rock guitar solo plays during the [[bridge (music)|bridge]]. Towards the end of the song, the sound of the drums are decreased, while the [[clef|treble]] is increased.<ref name="rikky2"/> According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by [[Alfred Music Publishing|Alfred Publishing]], the song is set in the [[time signature]] of common time, with a moderate [[tempo]] of 100 [[Tempo|beats per minute]]. It is composed in the key of [[C minor]], with Madonna's vocals ranging from a low-note of [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}}<sub>3</sub>]] to a high-note of [[F-sharp minor|F{{music|sharp}}<sub>5</sub>]]. The song has a basic sequence of Cm&ndash;B{{music|flat}}<U+2013>G7 in the verses and A{{music|flat}}&ndash;B{{music|flat}}&ndash;Cm&ndash;Cm/G in the chorus, as its [[chord progression]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Digital Sheet Music <U+2013> Madonna <U+2013> Like a Virgin book|work=''Musicnotes.com''|publisher=[[Alfred Music Publishing|Alfred Publishing]]|accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref>

The lyrics of the song are a metaphor for fashion and sex. Madonna sings about clothes she would like to drape over her man, so that she can caress his body with her hands, and cover him with "Velvet Kisses".<ref name="rikky2"/> According to Rikky Rooksby, author of ''Madonna: The Complete Guide To Her Music'', the line "I'll create a look that's made for you", later became synonymous with Madonna's re-invention of her image throughout her career.<ref>{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=15}}</ref>

Madonna has performed "Dress You Up" on three of her world tours, namely [[The Virgin Tour]] in 1985, the [[Who's That Girl World Tour]] in 1987, and the 2009 leg of the [[Sticky & Sweet Tour]]. On The Virgin Tour, "Dress You Up" was the opening song of the set. Madonna wore a blue see-through crop-top, revealing her characteristic black bra. She also had lacy leggings and crucifixes around her ear and her neck. As the beat of the song started, Madonna entered the stage and posed on the stairs before reaching the microphone to sing the track.<ref>{{harvnb|Clerk|2002|p=41}}</ref> A performance of the song from the Virgin Tour was included on the [[VHS]] release ''[[Live <U+2013> The Virgin Tour]]''.<ref>{{cite video|people=Madonna|title=[[Live <U+2013> The Virgin Tour]]|medium=VHS|publisher=Warner Bros.

She wore an elaborate costume, inspired by [[Dame Edna Everage]]. It consisted of a hat strewn with fake fruits, flowers and feathers, jeweled batwing spectacles with heavy, black frames, a ruffled skirt and a bodice covered with objects such as watches and dolls and fishnets. Author Carol Clrek stated that the dress was more "ludicrous for Madonna, than humorous."<ref>{{harvnb|Clerk|2002|p=66}}</ref> Two different performances of the song on this tour can be found on the videos: ''[[Ciao, Italia! <U+2013> Live from Italy|Who's That Girl <U+2013> Live in Japan]]'', filmed in Tokyo, Japan, on June 22, 1987,<ref>{{cite video|people=Madonna|title=[[Ciao, Italia! <U+2013> Live from Italy|Who's That Girl <U+2013> Live in Japan]]|medium=VHS|publisher=Warner-Pioneer Japan|date=1987}}</ref> and ''[[Ciao, Italia! <U+2013> Live from Italy]]'', filmed in Turin, Italy, on September 4, 1987.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Phares|first=Heather|title=Ciao Italia: Live in Italy (Video) > Overview |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r86678|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic.

A backing track was created to accompany the performance of "Dress You Up" on her 2004 [[Re-Invention World Tour]], however Madonna found it difficult to learn the guitar chords for the song, choosing to perform "[[Material Girl]]" instead.<ref>{{harvnb|Timmerman|2007|p=61}}</ref> In 2008, Madonna performed the first verse and chorus of the song during the request section of the [[Sticky & Sweet Tour]].

== Legacy ==
In 1985, the song was the subject of much media attention, when it was included on the [[Parents Music Resource Center]]'s (PMRC) "[[Parents Music Resource Center#Actions|Filthy Fifteen]]" list, for the perceived [[sex]]ual content of its lyrics. The Center's founder [[Tipper Gore]] had heard her daughter listening to the song, and considered the line "Gonna dress you up in my love" as exemplifying 'vulgar music'. The PMRC called upon the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) to give parents a consumer-friendly means of identifying rock records unsuitable for minors <U+2013> a rating system based on lyrical content. "Dress You Up" received a rating of 'S', for "sex and obscenity", from the RIAA.<ref name="fouz">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez|Freya Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=60}}</ref> Gore commented on the song: "Popular culture is [[morally bankrupt]], flagrantly licentious and utterly materialistic<U+2014>and Madonna is the worst of all." According to Bruce David Forbes and H. Mahan in their book ''Religion and Popular Culture in America'', Madonna's fans took the attitude "Can't you cultural conservatives see what she is trying to do<U+2014>to annoy people like you! If you don't like it, don't listen to it. Stop trying to police my morality!"<ref>{{harvnb|Forbes|H. Mahan|2005|p=76}}</ref> The campaign was successful and led to the creation of the [[Parental Advisory]] sticker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.totse.com/en/ego/can_you_dance_to_it/pmrcsuks.html|title=Can You Dance To It: PMRC Sucks|date=2007-03-13|publisher=[[TOTSE]]|accessdate=2010-02-23|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080609234749/http://www.totse.com/en/ego/can_you_dance_to_it/pmrcsuks.html |archivedate = June 9, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>
