"Demi-lancer" is a term used in 16th century military parlance to designate mounted men on unarmored horses, armed with light [[lance]]s and wearing three-quarter or half-armors (or even only [[helmet]]s and [[cuirass]]es) as opposed to the heavier lances and full [[plate armor]] of earlier [[knight]]s and [[gendarme]]s. They were representative of the early modern trend of reducing the coverage of armor while increasing its thickness to provide protection for the vital areas against the fire of [[gunpowder]]-based [[firearms]]. This abbreviated armor was also meant to increase the mobility of the men and horses, as well as reducing the expense inherent in equipping and maintaining them throughout a long campaign.
