==Education and career==
Piot was born in in [[Leuven]], [[Belgium]]. He studied medicine at [[Ghent University]], and earned an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in 1974. He then began working at the [[Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp]] while pursuing a graduate degree in clinical [[microbiology]] from the [[University of Antwerp]]. He received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in microbiology from the University of Antwerp in 1980.

In 1976, while working at the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Piot was part of a team that discovered the [[Ebola]] virus.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(77)92002-5|noedit}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/35073639|noedit}}</ref> A Belgian doctor working in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Zaire]] sent had sent a blood sample from a Belgian nun who had fallen ill for further research after he could not identify the disease. Piot and his colleagues discovered the virus, and subsequently traveled to Zaire to help quell an outbreak which was spreading in the country. Piot's team made key discoveries into how the virus spread, and traveled from village to village, spreading information and putting the ill and those who had come into contact with them into quarantine. The epidemic was stopped in three months, after it had killed almost 300 people.<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28262541 The virus detective who discovered Ebola in 1976]</ref>

In the 1980s, Dr. Piot participated in a series of collaborative projects in Burundi, C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire, Kenya, Tanzania and Zaire. Project SIDA in Kinshasa, Zaire was the first international project on [[AIDS]] in Africa and is widely acknowledged as having provided the foundations of science's understanding of [[HIV]] infection in Africa. He was a professor of [[microbiology]], and of [[public health]] at the [[Prince Leopold Institute of Tropical Medicine]], in [[Antwerp]], and at the [[University of Nairobi]], [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], the [[University of Lausanne|Lausanne]], and a visiting professor at the [[London School of Economics]]. He was also a Senior Fellow at the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle, a Scholar in Residence at the [[Ford Foundation]], and a Senior Fellow at the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]].<ref name=background/>

==Quotes==
{{"|The latest global AIDS figures give us reason for concern and for some hope. The number of new infections rose to 4.3 million this year, at the same time 2.9 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses. Multi-drug and extremely drug resistant tuberculosis highlight new challenges in our collective response.|Peter Piot, World AIDS Day 2006 ([http://www.unaids.org/en/MediaCentre/PressMaterials/FeatureStory/20061130-WADStatements.asp read more])}}

{{"|On current trends, AIDS will kill tens of millions of people over the next 20 years. But this need not happen. We know prevention works. We know that HIV treatment and care work. The global AIDS response is poised to enter a new era: where leadership and commitment are at long last matched with the resources needed to get on with the job.|Peter Piot, 2006}}

{{"|It is time to increase funding. Sometimes I hear that there is "too much money for AIDS". Nothing could be further from the truth. Since the creation of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, there has been a tremendous increase in resources for AIDS, with the results we know. But the sobering reality is that the AIDS response remains under-funded. Last year, there was an $8 billion shortfall. So if we are going to sustain the gains we have made already and not waste the investments and the results we have, if we are going to get anywhere near universal access to HIV prevention treatment and care, the world will need to significantly increase investments in AIDS.<ref>{{ UN document |docid=A-62-PV.102 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbatim Report |session=62 |meeting=102 |page=4 |anchor=pg004-bk02-pa11 |date=10 June 2008 |speakername=Mr. Piot | speakernation=Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS |accessdate=2008-09-08 }}</ref>}}
