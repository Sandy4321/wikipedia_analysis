<blockquote>"Carrie had told me in an earlier writing appointment that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn<U+2019>t give away how the two women got rid of the man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it<U+2019>s unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out."<ref name=unc>{{citeweb|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/carrie-underwood-two-black-cadillacs-lyrics/|title=Carrie Underwood, <U+2018>Two Black Cadillacs<U+2019> <U+2013> Lyrics Uncovered|last=Conaway|first=Alana|date=November 21, 2012|accessdate=April 19, 2014|work=Taste of Country|publisher=Taste of Country Network}}</ref></blockquote>
