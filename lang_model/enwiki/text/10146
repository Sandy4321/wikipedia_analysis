'''Christopher Columbus''' (1451 &ndash; [[May 20]], [[1506]]) was a [[navigator]], [[colonialist|colonizer]], and [[explorer]] who was instrumental in [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. Though not the first to reach the Americas from Europe, Columbus' voyages led to general European awareness of the hemisphere and the successful establishment of European cultures in the [[New World]]. It is generally believed that he was born in [[Genoa]], although other theories exist. The name ''Christopher Columbus'' is the Anglicization of the [[Latin]] '''Christophorus Columbus'''.  Also well known are his name's rendering in modern [[Italian language|Italian]] as '''Cristoforo Colombo''', in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as '''Crist<U+00F3>v<U+00E3>o Colombo''' (formerly ''Christovam Colom''), and in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as '''Crist<U+00F3>bal Col<U+00F3>n'''.

Columbus' voyages across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] began a [[Europe]]an effort at [[exploration]] and [[European colonization of the Americas|colonization]] of the [[Western Hemisphere]]. While history places great significance on his first voyage of 1492, he did not actually reach the [[South America|American]] mainland until his third voyage in 1498. Instead, he made landfall on an island in the Bahamas Archipelago that he named ''San Salvador'' while trying to find a sea route to India, hence the indigenous inhabitants being called "Indians". Likewise, he was not the earliest European explorer to reach the Americas, and there are accounts of [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact|European transatlantic contact]] prior to 1492. Nevertheless, Columbus's voyage came at a critical time of growing [[Imperialism|national imperialism]] and [[Competition|economic competition]] between [[History of Europe|developing nation states]] seeking wealth from the establishment of [[trade route]]s and [[Colonialism|colonies]]. The term [[Pre-Columbian]] is sometimes used to refer to the people and cultures of the Americas before the arrival of Columbus and further European influence.

The anniversary of the 1492 voyage (''vd''. [[Columbus Day]]) is observed throughout the Americas and in [[Spain]]. 

===Early life===

<!--THIS SECTION IS LARGELY BASED ON BRITANNICA AND MORISON's ''Christopher Columbus''-->
According to the most widely acknowledged biographies, Columbus was born between August and October 1451 in [[Genoa]]. His father was [[Domenico Colombo]], a middle-class wool weaver working between Genoa and [[Savona]]. His mother was [[Susanna Fontanarossa]]. Bartolomeo, Giovanni Pellegrino and Giacomo were his brothers. Bartolomeo worked in a [[cartography]] workshop in [[Lisbon]] for at least part of his adulthood.<ref name="britannica" />

While information about Columbus' early years is scarce, he probably received an incomplete education. He spoke a Genoese dialect. In one of his writings, Columbus claims to have gone to the sea at the age of 10. In 1470 the Columbus Family moved to Savona, where Domenico took over a tavern. In the same year, Columbus was on a Genoese ship hired in the service of [[Ren<U+00E9> I of Anjou]] to support his attempt to conquer the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. 

In 1473 Columbus began his apprenticeship as business agent for the important Centurione, Di Negro and Spinola families of Genoa. Later he allegedly made a trip to [[Chios]], in the [[Aegean Sea]]. In May 1476, he took part in an armed convoy sent by Genoa to carry a valuable cargo to northern Europe. He docked in Bristol, Galway, in Ireland and was possibly in Iceland in 1477. In 1479 Columbus reached his brother Bartolomeo in [[Lisbon]], keeping on trading for the Centurione family. He married Filipa Moniz Perestrello, daughter of the [[Porto Santo]] governor, [[Bartolomeo Perestrello]]. In 1481, his son, [[Diego Columbus|Diego]] was born.He calls himself Diego Colon Moniz i.e. he never used Perestrelo in his name.

===Navigation plans===
[[Image:ColombusMap.jpg|thumb|The "Colombus map" was drawn circa 1490 in the workshop of Bartolomeo and Christopher Colombus in [[Lisbon]].<ref>"Marco Polo et le Livre des Merveilles", ISBN 9782354040079 p.37</ref>]]
Europe had long enjoyed a safe land passage to [[China]] and [[India]]<U+2014> sources of valued [[goods]] such as [[silk]], [[spices]], and [[opium|opiates]]<U+2014> under the [[hegemony]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] (the [[Pax Mongolica]], or ''Mongol peace''). With the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453, the land route to Asia became more difficult. The Columbus brothers had a different idea. By the 1480s, they had developed a plan to travel to the Indies, then construed roughly as all of south and east Asia, by sailing directly west across the "[[Ocean Sea]]," ''i.e.,'' the Atlantic.

Following [[Washington Irving]]'s 1828 biography of Columbus, Americans commonly believed Columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because Europeans thought [[flat earth|the Earth was flat]].<ref name=book3>{{cite book | first=Paul F|last=Boller | title=Not So!:Popular Myths about America from Columbus to Clinton | year=1995 | id=ISBN 9780195091861}}</ref> In fact, the primitive maritime navigation of the time relied on the stars and the curvature of the [[spherical Earth]]. The European knowledge of the diameter of the Earth had improved since the [[Renaissance]] which started a few decades previously, and this knowledge had spread between sailors and navigators<ref>Russell, Jeffrey Burton 1991. ''Inventing the Flat Earth. Columbus and modern historians'', Praeger, New York, Westport, London 1991;<br />Zinn, Howard 1980. ''A People's History of the United States'', HarperCollins 2001. p.2</ref>. This had been the general opinion of ancient Greek science, and continued as the second opinion (for example of [[Bede]] in ''The Reckoning of Time''). In fact the Earth had generally been [[Spherical Earth|believed to be spherical]] since the 4th century BCE by most scholars and almost all navigators{{Fact|date=December 2007}}, and [[Eratosthenes]] had measured the diameter of the Earth with good precision in the second century BC<ref>Sagan, Carl. ''Cosmos''; the mean circumference of the Earth is 40,041.47 km.</ref>. Columbus put forth (incorrect) arguments based on a significantly smaller diameter for the Earth, claiming that Asia could be easily reached by sailing west across the Atlantic. Most scholars accepted [[Ptolemy]]'s correct assessment that the terrestrial landmass (for Europeans of the time, comprising Eurasia and Africa) occupied 180 [[longitude|degrees]] of the terrestrial sphere, and correctly dismissed Columbus's claim that the Earth was much smaller, and that Asia was only a few thousand nautical miles to the west of Europe. Columbus' error was put down to his lack of experience in navigation at sea<ref> Morison, Samuel Eliot, ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: The Life of Christopher Columbus'' Boston, 1942</ref>.

Columbus, believed the (incorrect) calculations of [[Marinus of Tyre]], putting the landmass at 225 degrees, leaving only 135 degrees of water. Moreover, Columbus believed that one degree represented a shorter distance on the earth's surface than was actually the case. Finally, he read maps as if the distances were calculated in [[Mile#Other miles|Italian mile]]s (1,238 meters<!--Shouldn't it be 1,520 m-->). Accepting the length of a degree to be 56<U+2154> miles, from the writings of [[Alfraganus]], he therefore calculated the circumference of the Earth as 25,255 kilometers at most, and the distance from the [[Canary Islands]] to [[Japan]] as 3,000 Italian miles (3,700 km, or 2,300 statute miles) Columbus did not realize Al-Farghani used the much longer Arabic mile (about 1,830 m).

[[Image:ColombusNotesToMarcoPolo.jpg|thumb|Handwritten notes by Christopher Colombus on the latin edition of [[Marco Polo]]'s ''Le livre des merveilles''.]]
The main problem was that experts did not accept his estimate. The true circumference of the Earth is about 40,000 km (25,000 sm), a figure established by [[Eratosthenes]] in the second century BC,<ref>Sagan, Carl. ''Cosmos''; the mean circumference of the Earth is 40,041.47 km.</ref>   and the distance from the Canary Islands to Japan 19,600 km (12,200 sm). No ship that was readily available in the 15th century could carry enough food and fresh water for such a journey. Most European sailors and navigators concluded, likely correctly, that sailors undertaking a westward voyage from Europe to Asia non-stop would die of thirst or starvation long before reaching their destination. Spain, however, having completed an expensive war, was desperate for a competitive edge over other European countries in trade with the East Indies. Columbus promised such an advantage.

While Columbus' calculations underestimated the circumference of the Earth and the distance from the Canary Islands to Japan by the standards of his peers as well as in fact, almost all Europeans held the mistaken opinion that the aquatic expanse between Europe and Asia was uninterrupted.  As the 16th century developed it was the route to America, rather than to Japan, that gave Spain a competitive edge in developing an overseas empire.

===Funding campaign===

In 1485, Columbus presented his plans to [[John II of Portugal|John II]], [[King of Portugal]]. He proposed the king equip three sturdy ships and grant Columbus one year's time to sail out into the [[Atlantic]], search for a western route to [[Orient]], and then return home. Columbus also requested he be made "Great Admiral of the Ocean", created governor of any and all lands he discovered, and given one-tenth of all revenue from those lands discovered. The king submitted the proposal to his experts, who rejected it. It was their considered opinion that Columbus' proposed route of {{convert|2400|mi|km|-1}} was, in fact, far too short.<ref> Morison, Samuel Eliot, ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: The Life of Christopher Columbus'' Boston, 1942</ref>

In 1488 Columbus appealed to the court of Portugal once again, and once again John invited him to an audience. It too was to come to nothing, for not long afterwards came the arrival of Portugal's native son [[Bartholomeu Dias]] from a successful rounding of the southern tip of Africa. Portugal was no longer interested in trailblazing a western route to the East. 

Columbus traveled from Portugal once more to both [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]], but he received encouragement from neither. Previously he had his brother sound out [[Henry VII of England]], to see if the [[English monarch]] might not be more amenable to Columbus' proposal. After much carefully considered hesitation Henry's invitation came, too late. Columbus had already committed himself to [[Spain]].

[[Image:Monumento a Col<U+00F3>n (Madrid) 02b.jpg|thumb|200px|right|<small>Columbus and Queen Isabella. Detail of the Columbus monument in [[Madrid]] (1885).</small>]]

He had sought an audience from the monarchs [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]] of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella I]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], who had united the largest kingdoms of Spain by marrying, and were ruling together. On May 1, 1486, permission having been granted, Columbus laid his plans before Queen Isabella, who, in turn, referred it to a committee. After the passing of much time, these savants of Spain, like their counterparts in Portugal, reported back that Columbus had judged the distance to [[Asia]] much too short. They pronounced the idea impractical, and advised their Royal Highnesses to pass on the proposed venture.

However, to keep Columbus from taking his ideas elsewhere, and perhaps to keep their options open, the King and Queen of Spain gave him an annual annuity of 12,000 ''[[maravedis]]'' ($840) and in 1489 furnished him with a letter ordering all Spanish cities and towns to provide him food and lodging at no cost.<ref>Durant, Will ''"The Story of Civilization"'' vol. vi, "The Reformation". Chapter XIII, page 260.</ref>

After continually lobbying at the Spanish court, he finally had success in 1492. Ferdinand and Isabella had just conquered [[Granada]], the last Muslim stronghold on the [[Iberian peninsula]], and they received Columbus in [[C<U+00F3>rdoba (Spain)|C<U+00F3>rdoba]], in the ''[[Alc<U+00E1>zar de los Reyes Cristianos|Alc<U+00E1>zar]]'' castle. Isabella turned Columbus down on the advice of her confessor, and he was leaving town in despair, when Ferdinand intervened. Isabella then sent a royal guard to fetch him and Ferdinand later rightfully claimed credit for being "the principal cause why those islands were discovered". King Ferdinand is referred to as "losing his patience" in this issue, but this cannot be proven.

About half of the financing was to come from private Italian investors, whom Columbus had    already lined up. Financially broke after the Granada campaign, the monarchs left it to the royal treasurer to shift funds among various royal accounts on behalf of the enterprise. Columbus was to be made "Admiral of the Seas" and would receive a portion of all profits. The terms were unusually generous, but as his own son later wrote, the monarchs did not really expect him to return.

According to the contract that Columbus made with King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, if Columbus discovered any new islands or mainland, he would receive many high rewards. In terms of power, he would be given the rank of Admiral of the Ocean Sea (Atlantic Ocean) and appointed Viceroy and Governor of all the new lands. He had the right to nominate three persons, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the new lands. He would be entitled to 10 percent of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity; this part was denied to him in the contract, although it was one of his demands.
Finally, he would also have the option of buying one-eighth interest in any commercial venture with the new lands and receive one-eighth of the profits.

Columbus was later arrested in 1500 and supplanted from these posts. After his death, Columbus's sons, Diego and Fernando, took legal action to enforce their father's contract. Many of the smears against Columbus were initiated by the Spanish crown during these lengthy court cases,  known as the ''pleitos colombinos''.  The family had some success in their first litigation, as a judgment of 1511 confirmed Diego's position as Viceroy, but reduced his powers.  Diego resumed litigation in 1512, which lasted until 1536, and further disputes continued until 1790.<ref>Mark McDonald, "Ferdinand Columbus, Renaissance Collector (1488-1539)", 2005, British Museum Press, ISBN 9780714126449 </ref>

===First voyage===

[[Image:Columbus Taking Possession.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A depiction of Columbus claiming possession of the [[New World]] in a [[chromolithograph]] made by the Prang Education Company in 1893.]]
On the evening of [[August 3]], [[1492]], Columbus departed from [[Palos de la Frontera]] with three ships; one larger [[carrack]], ''[[Santa Mar<U+00ED>a (ship)|Santa Mar<U+00ED>a]]'', nicknamed ''Gallega'' (''the Gallician''), and two smaller [[caravel]]s, ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' (''the Painted'') and ''Santa Clara'', nicknamed ''[[Ni<U+00F1>a]]'' (''the Girl''). (The ships were never officially named).{{Fact|date=February 2007}} They were property of [[Juan de la Cosa]] and the [[The Pinz<U+00F3>n Brothers|Pinz<U+00F3>n brothers]] ([[Martin Alonzo Pinz<U+00F3>n|Martin Alonzo]] and [[Vicente Y<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez Pinz<U+00F3>n|Vicente Y<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez]]), but the monarchs forced the [[Palos]] inhabitants to contribute to the expedition. Columbus first sailed to the [[Canary Islands]], which were owned by [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], where he restocked the provisions and made repairs, and on [[September 6]], he started what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean.      

Land was sighted at 2 [[12-hour clock|a.m.]] on [[October 12]], [[1492]], by a sailor named [[Rodrigo de Triana]] (also known as Juan Rodr<U+00ED>guez Bermejo) aboard ''Pinta''.<ref name=book2>{{cite book | author= Clements R. Markham, ed | title=The Journal of Christopher Columbus (During His First Voyage) | Hakluyt Society (1893) | id={{ASIN|B000I1OMXM}}}}</ref> (Columbus would claim the prize.) Columbus called the island (in what is now [[The Bahamas]]) ''San Salvador'', although the natives called it [[Guanahani]]. Exactly which island in the Bahamas this corresponds to is an unresolved topic; prime candidates are [[Samana Cay]], [[Plana Cays]], or [[San Salvador Island]] (named San Salvador in 1925 in the belief that it was Columbus's San Salvador). The [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] he encountered, the [[Lucayan]], [[Ta<U+00ED>no]] or [[Arawak]], were peaceful and friendly. From the October 12, 1492 entry in his journal he wrote of them, "Many of the men I have seen have scars on their bodies, and when I made signs to them to find out how this happened, they indicated that people from other nearby islands come to San Salvador to capture them; they defend themselves the best they can.  I believe that people from the mainland come here to take them as slaves.  They ought to make good and skilled servants, for they repeat very quickly whatever we say to them.  I think they can very easily be made Christians, for they seem to have no religion.  If it pleases our Lord, I will take six of them to Your Highnesses when I depart, in order that they may learn our language." <ref>Robert H. Fuson, ed ''The Log of Christopher Columbus'', Tab Books, 1992, International Marine Publishing, ISBN 0-87742-316-4 </ref>

He also wrote of them, two days after landing, "I could conquer the whole of them with 50 men, and govern them as I pleased." <ref>[http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2004/10/12/News/Columbus.Day.Sparks.Debate.Over.Explorers.Legacy-1425748.shtml Columbus Day sparks debate over explorer's legacy - News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Image:ChristopherColumbusFlag1492.JPG|200px|left|thumb|Captain's Ensign of Columbus' Ships]]
Columbus also explored the northeast coast of [[Cuba]] (landed on [[October 28]]) and the northern coast of [[Hispaniola]], by [[December 5]]. Here, the ''[[Santa Maria (ship)|Santa Maria]]'' ran aground on [[Christmas]] morning 1492 and had to be abandoned. He was received by the native [[cacique]] [[Guacanagari]], who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind. Columbus left 39 men and founded the settlement of ''[[La Navidad]]'' in what is now present-day [[Haiti]].<ref>{{cite web| author=Maclean, Frances| title=The Lost Fort of Columbus| url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/fort-of-columbus-200801.html| publisher=''[[Smithsonian Magazine]]''| date=January, 2008| accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref> Before returning to Spain, Columbus also kidnapped some ten to twenty-five Indians and took them back with him. Only seven or eight of the Indians arrived in Spain alive, but they made quite an impression on Seville.<ref name=book2>{{cite book | author= James W. Loewen | title=Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong | Touchstone Books (1995) | id={{ASIN|1402579373}}}}</ref>

Columbus headed for Spain, but another storm forced him into [[Lisbon]]. He anchored next to the King's harbor patrol ship on [[March 4]], [[1493]] in Portugal. After spending more than one week in Portugal, he set sail for Spain. He reached Spain on [[March 15]], [[1493]].  Word of his finding new lands rapidly spread throughout Europe.

There is increasing modern scientific evidence that this voyage also brought [[syphilis]] back from the New World. Many of the crew members who served on this voyage later joined the army of [[King Charles VIII]] in his invasion of [[Italy]] in 1495 resulting in the spreading of the disease across Europe and as many at 5 million deaths.<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2008/01/14/syphilis-columbus.html|title = Study traces origins of syphilis in Europe to New World|accessdate = 2008-01-15|last = CBC News Staff|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = January}}</ref><ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0000148|title = On the Origin of the Treponematoses: A Phylogenetic Approach|accessdate = 2008-01-21|last = Harper, Kristin, et al|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = January}}</ref>

===Second voyage===

[[Image:Columbus2.PNG|thumb|300px|left|Second voyage.]]

Columbus left [[C<U+00E1>diz]], Spain, on [[September 24]], [[1493]] to find new territories, with 17 ships carrying supplies, and about 1,200 men to colonize the region. On [[October 13]], the ships left the Canary Islands as they had on the first voyage, following a more southerly course.

On [[November 3]], [[1493]], Columbus sighted a rugged island that he named [[Dominica]] (Latin for Sunday); later that day, he landed at [[Marie-Galante]], which he named Santa Maria la Galante. After sailing past [[Les Saintes]] (Los Santos, The Saints), he arrived at [[Guadeloupe]] ([[Santa Mar<U+00ED>a de Guadalupe]] de Extremadura, after the image of the Virgin Mary venerated at the Spanish monastery of [[Villuercas]], in Guadalupe, Spain), which he explored between [[November 4]] and [[November 10]], [[1493]].

The exact course of his voyage through the [[Lesser Antilles]] is debated, but it seems likely that he turned north, sighting and naming several islands, including [[Montserrat]] (for Santa Maria de Montserrate, after the Blessed Virgin of the Monastery of Montserrat, which is located on the Mountain of Montserrat, in Catalonia, Spain), [[Antigua]] (after a church in Seville, Spain, called Santa Maria la Antigua, meaning "Old St. Mary's"), [[Redonda]] (for Santa Maria la Redonda, Spanish for "round", owing to the island's shape), [[Nevis]] (derived from the Spanish, Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de las Nieves, meaning "Our Lady of the Snows", because Columbus thought the clouds over Nevis Peak made the island resemble a snow-capped mountain), [[Saint Kitts]] (for [[St. Christopher]], patron of sailors and travelers), [[Sint Eustatius]] (for the early Roman martyr, [[Saint Eustace|St. Eustachius]]), [[Saba]] (also for St. Christopher?), [[Saint Martin]] (San Martin), and [[Saint Croix]] ([[Santa Cruz]], meaning "[[Holy Cross]]"). He also sighted the island chain of the [[Virgin Islands]] (and named them Islas de Santa Ursula y las Once Mil Virgenes, [[Saint Ursula]] and the 11,000 Virgins, a cumbersome name that was usually shortened, both on maps of the time and in common parlance, to Islas Virgenes), and he also named the islands of [[Virgin Gorda]] (the fat virgin), [[Tortola]], and [[Peter Island]] (San Pedro).

He continued to the [[Greater Antilles]], and landed at [[Puerto Rico]] (originally San Juan Bautista, in honor of Saint John the Baptist, a name that was later supplanted by Puerto Rico (English: Rich Port) while the capital retained the name, San Juan) on [[November 19]], [[1493]]. One of the first skirmishes between native Americans and Europeans since the time of the Vikings<ref name=book1>{{cite book | author=Phillips, Jr., William D. & Carla Rahn Phillips | title=The Worlds of Christopher Columbus | year=1992 | id=ISBN 9780521350976}}</ref> took place when Columbus's men rescued two boys who had just been castrated by their captors.

<!-- This paragraph, while interesting and peripherally relevant, is totally out of place in the midst of these preceding and following paragraphs. --><!--
Michele de Cuneo, a Ligurian nobleman on Columbus' second voyage, wrote in 1495, "While I was in the boat I captured a very beautiful Carib woman the said Lord Admiral gave to me, and with whom, having taken her into my cabin, she being naked according to their custom, I conceived desire to take pleasure. I wanted to put my desire into execution but she did not want it and treated me with her fingernails in such a manner that I wished I had never begun.  But seeing that (to tell you the end of it all), I took a rope and thrashed her well, for which she raised such unheard of screams that you would not have believed your ears.  Finally we came to an agreement in such manner that I can tell you that she seemed to have been brought up in a school of harlots." <ref> Morison, Samuel Eliot, Editor, Journals and Other Documents on the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus, 1963, p. 212</ref>
-->
On [[November 22]], Columbus returned to Hispaniola, where he intended to visit [[La Navidad|Fuerte de la Navidad]] (Christmas Fort), built during his first voyage, and located on the northern coast of [[Haiti]]; Fuerte de la Navidad was found in ruins, destroyed by the native [[Taino]] people, whereupon, Columbus moved more than 100 kilometers eastwards, establishing a new settlement, which he called  [[La Isabela]], likewise on the northern coast of [[La Hispaniola|Hispaniola]], in the present-day [[Dominican Republic]]. However, [[La Isabela]] proved to be a poorly-chosen location, and the settlement was short-lived.

He left Hispaniola on [[April 24]], [[1494]], arrived at [[Cuba]] (naming it Juana) on [[April 30]]. He explored the southern coast of Cuba, which he believed to be a peninsula rather than an island, and several nearby islands, including the [[Isla de la Juventud<U+200E>|Isle of Pines]] (Isla de las Pinas, later known as La Evangelista, The Evangelist). He reached [[Jamaica]] on [[May 5]].  He retraced his route to Hispaniola, arriving on [[August 20]], before he finally returned to Spain.

During this second trip, the rape of an indigenous woman was reported by one of Columbus's crew ([[Michel de Cuneo]]) and with Columbus's tolerance:

{{quote|''When I was in the ship, I turned into captivity a beautiful caribe woman, given to me as a gift by the Almirant, and after I took her to my stateroom, and while she was naked as their custom is, I felt desires of laying with her.

===Third voyage===

[[Image:AndalusAndMorocco.png|200px|thumb|Location of city of [[Sanl<U+00FA>car de Barrameda]], the starting point for Columbus' third journey.]]

On [[May 30]], [[1498]], Columbus left with six ships from [[Sanl<U+00FA>car de Barrameda|Sanl<U+00FA>car, Spain]], for his third trip to the New World. He was accompanied by the young [[Bartolom<U+00E9> de Las Casas]], who would later provide partial transcripts of Columbus' logs.  

Columbus led the fleet to the Portuguese island of [[Porto Santo]], his wife's native land. He then sailed to [[Madeira]] and spent some time there with the Portuguese captain Jo<U+00E3>o Gon<U+00E7>alves da Camara before sailing to the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Cape Verde]].  Columbus landed on the south coast of the island of [[Trinidad]] on [[July 31]].  From [[August 4]] through [[August 12]], he explored the [[Gulf of Paria]] which separates [[Trinidad]] from [[Venezuela]].  He explored the mainland of [[South America]], including the [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]].  He also sailed to the islands of [[Chacachacare]] and [[Margarita Island]] and sighted and named [[Tobago]] (Bella Forma) and [[Grenada]] (Concepcion).  

Columbus returned to [[Hispaniola]] on [[August 19]] to find that many of the Spanish settlers of the new colony were discontented, having been misled by Columbus about the supposedly bountiful riches of the new world. An entry in his journal from September 1498 reads, "From here one might send, in the name of the Holy Trinity, as many slaves as could be sold..." Indeed, as a fierce supporter of slavery, Columbus ultimately refused to baptize the native people of Hispanolia, since Catholic law forbade the enslavement of Christians. <ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/17/world/main2098785.shtml Christopher Columbus: Man Of Mystery, Not Much Is Known, And Some Of What's Been Discovered Isn't Good - CBS News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Columbus repeatedly had to deal with rebellious settlers and natives. {{Fact|date=October 2007}} He had some of his crew hanged for disobeying him. A number of returning settlers and sailors lobbied against Columbus at the Spanish court, accusing him and his brothers of gross mismanagement. On his return he was arrested for a period (see Governorship and arrest section below).

===Fourth voyage===

[[Image:Columbus4.PNG|thumb|300px|left|Fourth voyage.]]
Columbus made a fourth voyage nominally in search of the [[Strait of Malacca]] to the [[Indian Ocean]]. Accompanied by his brother [[Bartolomeo Columbus|Bartolomeo]] and his 13-year-old son [[Fernando Col<U+00F3>n|Fernando]], he left C<U+00E1>diz, Spain, on [[May 11]], [[1502]], with the ships ''Capitana'', ''Gallega'', ''Vizca<U+00ED>na'' and ''Santiago de Palos''. He sailed to [[Arzila]] on the Moroccan coast to rescue [[Portugal|Portuguese]] soldiers whom he had heard were under siege by the [[Moors]]. On June 15, they landed at Carbet on the island of [[Martinique]] (''Martinica'').  A [[hurricane]] was brewing, so he continued on, hoping to find shelter on [[Hispaniola]].  He arrived at [[Santo Domingo]] on June 29, but was denied port, and the new governor refused to listen to his storm prediction. Instead, while Columbus' ships sheltered at the mouth of the [[Rio Jaina]], the first Spanish treasure fleet sailed into the hurricane. Columbus' ships survived with only minor damage, while twenty-nine of the thirty ships in the governor's fleet were lost to [[1492-1524 Atlantic hurricane seasons|the July 1st storm]]. In addition to the ships, 500 lives (including that of the governor, [[Francisco de Bobadilla]]) and an immense cargo of gold were surrendered to the sea. 

After a brief stop at [[Jamaica]], Columbus sailed to [[Central America]], arriving at [[Guanaja|Guanaja (Isla de Pinos)]]  in the [[Islas de la Bah<U+00ED>a department|Bay Islands]] off the coast of [[Honduras]] on [[July 30]].  Here Bartolomeo found native merchants and a large canoe, which was described as "long as a galley" and was filled with cargo.  On [[August 14]], he landed on the American mainland at Puerto Castilla, near [[Trujillo, Honduras]].  He spent two months exploring the coasts of Honduras, [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]], before arriving in Almirante Bay, [[Panama]] on [[October 16]].

On [[December 5]], [[1502]], Columbus and his crew found themselves in a storm unlike any they had ever experienced. In his journal Columbus writes,
<blockquote> For nine days I was as one lost, without hope of life. Eyes never beheld the sea so angry, so high, so covered with foam. The wind not only prevented our progress, but offered no opportunity to run behind
any headland for shelter; hence we were forced to keep out in this bloody
ocean, seething like a pot on a hot fire. Never did the sky look more 
terrible; for one whole day and night it blazed like a furnace, and the lightning broke with such violence that each time I wondered if it had carried off my spars and sails; the flashes came with such fury and frightfulness that we all thought that the ship would be blasted. All
this time the water never ceased to fall from the sky; I do not say it rained, for it was like another deluge. The men were so worn out that 
they longed for death to end their dreadful suffering.<ref>Morison, Samuel Eliot,''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', Boston, 1942, page 617.</ref>
</blockquote>

In Panama, Columbus learned from the natives of gold and a strait to another ocean.  After much exploration, in January 1503 he established a garrison at the mouth of the [[Rio Belen]]. On April 6 one of the ships became stranded in the river. At the same time, the garrison was attacked, and the other ships were damaged. Columbus left for Hispaniola on April 16, heading north.  On May 10 he sighted the [[Cayman Islands]], naming them "''Las Tortugas''" after the numerous [[sea turtle]]s there. His ships next sustained more damage in a storm off the coast of Cuba.  Unable to travel farther, on [[June 25]], [[1503]], they were beached in [[Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica|St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica]].

For a year Columbus and his men remained stranded on Jamaica. A Spaniard, Diego Mendez, and some natives paddled a [[canoe]] to get help from [[Hispaniola]].  That island's governor, [[Nicol<U+00E1>s de Ovando]], detested Columbus and obstructed all efforts to rescue him and his men.  In the meantime Columbus, in a desperate effort to induce the natives to continue provisioning him and his hungry men, successfully intimidated the natives by correctly predicting a [[lunar eclipse]] for [[February 29]], [[1504]], using the ''[[Ephemeris]]'' of the German astronomer [[Regiomontanus]].<ref>[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Christopher Columbus, Mariner'', 1955, pp. 184-92.</ref>  Help finally arrived, no thanks to the governor, on [[June 29]], [[1504]], and Columbus and his men arrived in [[Sanl<U+00FA>car de Barrameda|Sanl<U+00FA>car, Spain]], on November 7.

==Governorship and arrest==

During Columbus' stint as governor and viceroy, disgruntled Spaniards, who chafed at being governed by an Italian, had claimed that he had ruled his domain tyrannically {{Fact|date=March 2007}}. Columbus was physically and mentally exhausted; his body was wracked by arthritis and his eyes by [[ophthalmia]]. In October 1499, he sent two ships to Spain, asking the Court of Spain to appoint a royal commissioner to help him govern.

The Court appointed [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], a member of the [[Order of Calatrava]]; however, his authority stretched far beyond what Columbus had requested. Bobadilla was given total control as governor from 1500 until his death in 1502. Arriving in Santo Domingo while Columbus was away, Bobadilla was immediately peppered with complaints about all three Columbus brothers: Christopher, Bartolom<U+00E9>, and Diego. Consuelo Varela, a Spanish historian, states: "Even those who loved him [Columbus] had to admit the atrocities that had taken place."<ref name=newspaper1>{{cite news |author=Giles Tremlett |title=Lost document reveals Columbus as tyrant of the Caribbean |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/spain/article/0,,1838823,00.html?gusrc=rss&feed=12 | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | date=[[2006-08-07]] | accessdate=2006-10-10 | language=English }}</ref><ref>Bobadilla's 48-page report&mdash;derived from the testimonies of 23 people who had seen or heard about the treatment meted out by Columbus and his brothers&mdash;had originally been lost for centuries, but was rediscovered in 2005 in the Spanish archives in [[Valladolid]]. It contained an account of Columbus' seven-year reign as the first [[Governor of the Indies]].</ref> 

As a result of these testimonies and without being allowed a word in his own defense, Columbus upon his return, had manacles placed on his arms and chains on his feet and was cast into prison to await return to Spain. He was 53 years old. 

On [[October 1]], [[1500]], Columbus and his two brothers, likewise in chains, were sent back to Spain. Once in C<U+00E1>diz, a grieving Columbus wrote to a friend at court:
<blockquote>
It is now seventeen years since I came to serve these princes with the Enterprise of the Indies. They made me pass eight of them in discussion, and at the end rejected it as a thing of jest. Nevertheless I persisted therein... Over there I have placed under their sovereignty more land than there is in Africa and Europe, and more than 1,700 islands... In seven years I, by the divine will, made that conquest. At a time when I was entitled to expect rewards and retirement, I was incontinently arrested and sent home loaded with chains... The accusation was brought out of malice on the basis of charges made by civilians who had revolted and wished to take possession on the land....

<P>I beg your graces, with the zeal of faithful Christians in whom their Highnesses have confidence, to read all my papers, and to consider how I, who came from so far to serve these princes... now at the end of my days have been despoiled of my honor and my property without cause, wherein is neither justice nor mercy.<ref>Morison, Samuel Eliot ''"Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus"'' page 576, Boston, 1942</ref>
</blockquote>

According to testimony of 23 witnesses during his trial, Columbus regularly used barbaric acts of torture to govern Hispaniola. <ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/17/world/main2098785.shtml Christopher Columbus: Man Of Mystery, Not Much Is Known, And Some Of What's Been Discovered Isn't Good - CBS News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Columbus and his brothers lingered in jail for six weeks before the busy King Ferdinand ordered their release. Not long thereafter, the king and queen summoned the Columbus brothers to their presence at the [[Alhambra]] palace in [[Granada]]. There the royal couple heard the brothers' pleas; restored their freedom and their wealth; and, after much persuasion, agreed to fund Columbus' fourth voyage. But the door was firmly shut on Christopher Columbus's role as governor. From that point forward, [[Nicol<U+00E1>s de Ovando|Don Nicol<U+00E1>s de Ovando]] was to be the new governor of the West Indies.

==Later life==

[[Image:ColumbusHouseOfValladolid.jpg|thumb|left|A statue of the Santa Maria, Columbus' flagship in his first voyage. The statue is at the House of Columbus in [[Valladolid]], Spain, the city where Columbus died.]]

While Columbus had always given the conversion of non-believers as one reason for his explorations, he grew increasingly religious in his later years. He claimed to hear divine voices, lobbied for a new [[crusade]] to capture [[Jerusalem]], often wore [[Franciscan]] habit, and described his explorations to the "paradise" as part of [[God]]'s plan which would soon result in the [[Christian eschatology|Last Judgment]] and the end of the world.

In his later years, Columbus demanded that the Spanish Crown give him 10% of all profits made in the new lands, pursuant to earlier agreements. Because he had been relieved of his duties as governor, the crown did not feel bound by these contracts, and his demands were rejected. After his death his family later sued for part of the profits from trade with America in the ''pliegos colombinos''.

[[Image:Tomb-of-columbus.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Columbus's tomb in [[Seville Cathedral]]. It is borne by four statues of kings representing the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n|Leon]], [[Aragon]], and [[Navarre]].]]
On [[May 20]], [[1506]], at about the age of 55, Columbus died in [[Valladolid]], fairly wealthy from the gold his men had accumulated in Hispaniola. When he died he was still convinced that his journeys had been along the east coast of Asia. According to a study, published in February 2007, by Antonio Rodriguez Cuartero, Department of Internal Medicine of the [[University of Granada]], he died of a heart attack caused by [[reactive arthritis|Reiter's Syndrome]] (also called reactive arthritis). According to his personal diaries and notes by contemporaries, the symptoms of this illness (burning pain during urination, pain and swelling of the knees, and [[conjunctivitis]] of the eyes) were clearly visible in his last three years.<ref>[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/408828.html Cause of the death of Colombus (in Spanish)]</ref>

His remains were first buried in Valladolid and then at the monastery of La Cartuja in [[Seville]] (southern Spain), by the will of his son [[Diego Col<U+00F3>n|Diego]], who had been governor of Hispaniola. Then in 1542, his remains were transferred to [[Santo Domingo]], in eastern Hispaniola. In 1795, the French took over Hispaniola, and his remains were moved to [[Havana]], Cuba. After Cuba became independent following the [[Spanish-American War]] in 1898, his remains were moved back to the [[Cathedral of Seville]] in Spain<ref>[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/12368307610158273876213/p0000001.htm ''Crist<U+00F3>bal Col<U+00F3>n: traslaci<U+00F3>n de sus restos mortales a la ciudad de Sevilla'' at Fundaci<U+00F3>n Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes]</ref>, where they were placed on an elaborate [[catafalque]]. However, a lead box bearing an inscription identifying "Don Christopher Columbus" and containing fragments of bone and a bullet was discovered at Santo Domingo in 1877. 

To lay to rest claims that the wrong relics were moved to Havana and that the remains of Columbus were left buried in the cathedral of Santo Domingo, [[DNA]] samples were taken in June 2003 (''History Today'' August 2003).   The results are not definitively conclusive.  Initial observations suggested that the bones did not appear to belong to somebody with the physique or age at death associated with Columbus.<ref>Giles Tremlett, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/spain/article/0,2763,1280590,00.html Young bones lay Columbus myth to rest], ''[[The Guardian]]'', August 11, 2004</ref> DNA extraction proved difficult; only a few limited fragments of [[mitochondrial DNA]] could be isolated.  However, such as they are, these do appear to match corresponding DNA from Columbus's brother, giving support to the idea that the two had the same mother and that the body therefore may be that of Columbus.<ref name="remains">{{cite news |first=Rossella |last=Lorenzi |title= DNA Suggests Columbus Remains in Spain |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20041004/columbus.html | publisher=[[Discovery Channel|Discovery News]] |date=[[October 6]], [[2004]] | accessdate=2006-10-11 | language=English}}</ref><ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12871458/ DNA verifies Columbus<U+2019> remains in Spain], ''[[Associated Press]]'', 19 May 2006</ref> The authorities in Santo Domingo have not allowed the remains there to be exhumed, so it is unknown if any of those remains could be from Columbus's body. The location of the Dominican remains is in the "Columbus Lighthouse" or Faro A Colon which is in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

[[Amerigo Vespucci]]'s travel journals, published 1502-4, convinced [[Martin Waldseem<U+00FC>ller]] that the discovered place was not India, as Columbus always believed, but a new [[continent]], and in 1507, a year after Columbus' death, Waldseem<U+00FC>ller published a world map [[Americas#Naming|calling the new continent]] ''America'' from Vespucci's Latinized name "Americus".  Though he never set foot in what today is the [[United States]], Columbus is sometimes viewed as a hero in that country.

===Columbus ascendant===
The nascent countries of the [[New World]], particularly the newly independent United States, seemed to need a historical narrative to give them roots.  This narrative was supplied in part by [[Washington Irving]] in 1828 with ''[[The Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus]]'', which may be the true source of much of the associations held about the explorer.

Historically, the British had downplayed Columbus and emphasized the role of [[John Cabot]] as a pioneering explorer. But, for the emerging United States, Cabot made a poor national hero. Veneration of Columbus in America dates back to colonial times. America itself was sometimes referred to as [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]. The use of Columbus as a founding figure of New World nations and the use of the word Columbia spread rapidly after the American Revolution. During the last two decades of the 18th century the name "Columbia" was given to the federal capital [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], South Carolina's new capital city, [[Columbia, South Carolina]], the [[Columbia River]], and numerous other places. Attempts to rename the United States "Columbia" failed, but Columbia became a female [[national personification]] of America, similar to the male [[Uncle Sam]]. Outside the United States the name was used in 1819 for the [[Gran Colombia|Republic of Colombia]], a precursor of the modern nation of [[Colombia]].

Hero worship of Columbus perhaps reached a zenith around 1892 when the 400th anniversary of his first arrival in the Americas occurred. Monuments to Columbus like the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]] were erected throughout the United States and [[Latin America]] extolling him. Numerous cities, towns, counties, and streets have been named after him, including the [[capital city|capital cities]] of two U.S. [[State (United States)|states]] ([[Columbus, Ohio]] and [[Columbia, South Carolina]]). 

The story that Columbus thought the world was round while his contemporaries believed in a [[flat earth]] was often repeated despite the fact that the real issue was the ''size'' of the Earth rather than its roundness.<ref>[http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Scolumb.htm Round Earth and Christopher Columbus]</ref> (In fact even [[Aristotle]], a key Classical figure in the Church doctrine of the day, had argued that the Earth was a globe,<ref>[http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Saristot.htm Aristotle and the round Earth].</ref><ref>Compare also [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1001.htm book 1, question 1, article 1] of [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', where the roundness of the Earth is given as a standard example of a well-known scientific truth.</ref> and Columbus's failure to reach China would have meant that, had he been trying to prove the world was round, he actually would have failed). This tale was used to show that Columbus was enlightened and forward looking. {{Fact|date=October 2007}}

The admiration of Columbus was particularly embraced by some members of the Italian American, Hispanic, and Catholic communities. These groups point to Columbus as one of their own to show that Mediterranean Catholics could and did make great contributions to the U.S. The modern vilification of Columbus is seen by his supporters as being politically motivated. {{Fact|date=October 2007}}

In 1909, descendants of Columbus undertook to dismantle the Columbus family chapel in Spain and move it to a site near [[State College]], Pennsylvania, where it may now be visited by the public.  At the museum associated with the chapel, there are a number of Columbus relics worthy of note, including the armchair which the "Admiral of the Ocean Sea" used at his chart table.

===Modern day===

[[Image:ColumbuscircleNYC.png|275px|right|300px|thumb|[[Columbus Circle]] in [[New York City]]. Italian sculptor [http://columbus.vanderkrogt.net/us_ne/newyork1.html Gaetano Russo's] central monument was dedicated in 1892, 400 years after Columbus arrived in [[Americas|America]].]]

Culpability is sometimes placed on contemporary governments and their citizens for the hardship suffered by Native Americans during the time of Christopher Columbus. Columbus myths and celebrations are generally a positive affair, making less room for this concept in history books. Christopher Columbus was strongly criticised[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/html/20061003T220000-0500_113618_OBS_THE_LEGACIES_OF_CHRISTOPHER_COLUMBUS_.asp] in a song by Jamaican artiste [[Burning Spear]] titled 'A Damn Blasted Liar.'  The controversial song opened a strong opinionated debate across much of the Caribbean region on the effects that Christopher Columbus and his leadership had on the region's native peoples.[http://www.blackbritain.co.uk/news/details.aspx?i=2225&c=slavery&h=Christopher+Columbus+tortured+slaves%2C+say+official+historical+documents]

The Spanish colonization of the Americas, and the subsequent effects on the native peoples, were dramatized in the 1992 feature film ''[[1492: Conquest of Paradise]]'' to commemorate the 500th anniversary of his landing in the Americas. *In 2003, Venezuelan President [[Hugo Ch<U+00E1>vez]] urged Native American Latin Americans to not celebrate the Columbus Day holiday. Chavez blamed Columbus for leading the way in the mass genocide of the Native Americans by the Spanish.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3184668.stm |title=Columbus 'sparked a genocide' |accessdate=2006-10-21 |date=October 12, 2003 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

==Physical appearance==

Although an abundance of artwork involving Christopher Columbus exists, no [[authentic]] contemporary [[portrait]] has been found. There is a portrait painted by [[Alejo Fern<U+00E1>ndez]], between 1505 and 1536, titled [[Virgen de los Navegantes]] in the Royal Alcazar in Seville. In 1595 [[Theodore de Bry]] made an [[etching]] after a painting of Columbus, made in his lifetime.<ref>[http://www.historical-prints.co.uk/Theodore.htm#_ftnref20 Theodore de Bry<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The etching shows  resemblance with the portrait of [[Sebastiano del Piombo]], so this painting might depict Columbus with some accuracy. Over the years, artists who reconstruct his appearance have done so from written descriptions. These writings describe him as having reddish hair, which turned to white early in his life, as well as being a lighter skinned person with too much sun exposure turning his face red. 

In keeping with descriptions of Columbus having had auburn hair or (later) white hair, textbooks use the Sebastiano del Piombo painting (which in its normal-sized resolution shows Columbus's hair as auburn) so often that it has become the iconic image of Columbus accepted by [[popular culture]].

==Controversies==
===Nationality===

{{main|Origin theories of Christopher Columbus}} 
It is generally accepted that Columbus was born in the [[Republic of Genoa]], located in modern-day [[Italy]].<ref name="britannica"> Encyclopedia Britannica, 1993 ed., Vol. 16, pp. 605ff / Morison, ''Christopher Columbus'', 1955 ed., pp. 14ff</ref> 188 notarial, judicial, and administrative documents about Cristoforo Colombo (Christopher Columbus) and his family have been preserved in the "Archivio di Stato" (national record office) of Genoa, Italy.<ref>http://www.archivi.beniculturali.it/ASGE/asge.htm (In Italian)</ref>
Some writers hold that his background was Spanish, Portuguese or Greek,<ref>uth G. Durlacher-Wolper: ''Christophoros Columbus: A Byzantine Prince from Chios, Greece.'' The New World Museum, San Salvador, Bahamas. 1982.</ref> but no conclusive evidence has ever been offered. Clues to Columbus' origin such as learned languages and [[DNA]] samples have been [[Genetic genealogy|studied]], but to date, DNA tests show only that Columbus was Caucasian, and probably was not (as some have argued) a [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jew]] (Spanish/Portuguese).<ref>Prof. Jos<U+00E9> Lorente, Prof. University of Granada in "Secrets from the Grave" (Discovery Channel, 2004)</ref> DNA surveys of present-day individuals with similar names in various countries are continuing.<ref>Amy Harmon, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/08/us/08columbus.html Seeking Columbus<U+2019>s Origins, With a Swab], [[New York Times]], October 8, 2007.</ref>  There was one document, which was written in Spain and kept by the Spaniards, the Last Will and Testament of 1498, where Columbus said he was from Genoa, but it is said to have been falsified, by the Spaniards, in 1573 (67 years after Columbus's death, along with certain other documents that supported this theory). <ref>{{pt icon}} Rosa, Manuel, "O Mist<U+00E9>rio Colombo Revelado", pp. 157-166, Lisbon, 2006</ref> However, there is proof in the memoirs of England's King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] (who was prepared to finance Columbus's voyage but was beaten to it by the Spaniards) that Columbus's brother had visited him frequently regarding Columbus's planned exploration and that the king had used his Royal translator, familiar with the dialect spoken in Genoa, Italy, to communicate with the visitor. King Henry VII identified Columbus's brother as an Italian from Genoa {{Fact|date=November 2007}}. All Portuguese chronicles state that Columbus was Genoese. A gloss journal of Columbus's, written in Italian, was kept by the Royal Court of Spain {{Fact|date=November 2007}}. A study made on Columbus's Spanish letters concluded that he wasn't a native speaker of a dialect of Spain. His journals, which were written in an extremely substandard form of Spanish mixed with Catalan and Portuguese, are proof that he wasn't an original inhabitant of Spain. His combination of languages is generally accepted as a learned way that Columbus, an uneducated twelve-year old from Genoa who set sail on a ship to Portugal, had eventually (through travels in Portugal and Spain) created this pidgin form of Iberian languages. Columbus's wide knowledge of the sea led to his first marriage to a noble Portuguese woman, Felipa Moniz Perestrello, who was the daughter of Bartolomeu Perestrello, the Governor of [[Madeira]]. This type of "reward" marriage had been typical in Europe throughout the ages. Many such rewards (as well as fortunes and noble titles) had been bestowed on middle-class and impoverished peoples throughout time by European nobles as rewards for their ideas and accomplishments{{Verify source|date=January 2008}}. It is commonly accepted that Columbus was not a Spaniard nobleman as some have implied. Most people worldwide find it unimaginable that a noble, educated Spaniard would write in a pidgin form of Iberian languages instead of in proper Spanish. Many of the letters that Columbus wrote to Italian people, some of them even from Genoa, were not written in Italian, but in a substandard, pidgin form of Iberian languages.

===Language===
{{seealso|Origin theories of Christopher Columbus#Language}} In addition to Genoese documents which have been kept about the son of a wool weaver named Colombo, there exists some letters, which are said to have been written by Columbus, that are composed in an extremely nonstandard, pidgin form of Spanish  mixed with [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] [[phonetics]]. It is said that Columbus used this mixture when writing personal notes to himself, to his brother, Italian friends, and to the Bank of Genoa. Two of his brothers, accepted as being people from Genoa, could have possibly understood this pidgin language. Genoese Italian was a language generally written by Genoa's schooled people at that time; the average person from Genoa naturally spoke a Genoese variant of Italian. 

In later years, Columbus mastered the use of [[Latin]]. He kept a journal in Latin as well as a more private journal in Greek.
