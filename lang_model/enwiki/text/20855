The exhausted fantasy is that of Ukraine<U+2019>s geopolitical significance. Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych seems to believe, and he is not alone, that because Ukraine lies between the European Union and Russia, each side must have an interest in controlling it, and therefore that smart geopolitics involves turning them against each other [...] The dangerous fantasy is the Russian idea that Ukraine is not really a different country, but rather a kind of [[Slavic people|Slavic]] younger brother. This is a legacy of the late [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Russification]] policies of the 1970s. It has no actual historical basis: East Slavic statehood arose in what is now Ukraine and was copied in Moscow, and the early Russian Empire was itself highly dependent upon educated inhabitants of Ukraine."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/dec/05/ukraine-protests-way-out/ |title=A Way Out for Ukraine? by Timothy Snyder &#124; NYRblog &#124; The New York Review of Books |publisher=Nybooks.com |date=2013-12-03 |accessdate=2013-12-08}}</ref>
