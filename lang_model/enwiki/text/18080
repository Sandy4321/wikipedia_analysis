The '''Russian monitor ''Charodeika''''' was the [[lead ship]] of her [[Charodeika-class monitor|class]] of [[Monitor (warship)|monitor]]s built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in the 1860s. She served for her entire career with the [[Baltic Fleet]], mostly as a [[training ship]]. She was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in 1907, but was not [[ship breaking|broken up]] until 1911<U+2013>12.

==Design and description==
''Charodeika'' was {{convert|206|ft|m|1}} long at the [[waterline]]. She had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|42|ft|m|1}} and a maximum [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|12|ft|7|in|m|1}}. The ship was designed to [[Displacement (ship)|displace]] {{convert|1882|LT|t}}, but turned out to be overweight and actually displaced {{convert|2100|LT|t}}. Her crew numbered 13 officers and 171 crewmen in 1877.<ref name=m6>McLaughlin, p. 156</ref>

The ship had two simple horizontal [[Marine steam engine#Direct acting|direct-acting steam engines]], each driving a single propeller. The engines were designed to produce a total of {{convert|900|ihp|lk=in}} using steam provided by two coal-fired rectangular [[fire-tube boiler]]s, but only achieved {{convert|786|ihp|abbr=on}} and a speed of approximately {{convert|8.5|kn|lk=in}} during her [[sea trial]]s.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 156, 159<U+2013>60</ref> She carried a maximum of {{convert|250|LT|t|0}} of coal for her boilers.<ref>Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 176</ref>

''Charodeika'' was initially armed with a pair of {{convert|9|in|adj=on|0|spell=in}} [[rifling|rifled]] Model 1867 guns in the forward gun turret and a pair of {{convert|15|in|adj=on|0|spell=in}} [[smoothbore]] [[Rodman gun]]s in the aft turret. The Rodman guns were replaced by a pair of [[Obukhov State Plant|Obukhov]] {{convert|9|in|0|adj=on}} rifled guns in 1871 and all of the nine-inch guns were replaced in their turn by longer, more powerful nine-inch Obukhov guns in 1878<U+2013>79. No light guns for use against [[torpedo boat]]s are known to have been fitted aboard the ship before the 1870s when she received 4 four-pounder {{convert|3.4|in|adj=on}} guns mounted on the turret tops as well as a variety of smaller guns that included {{convert|45|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} Engstr<U+00F6>m [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF) gun]]s, {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=on}} [[Nordenfelt gun]]s, single-barreled QF {{convert|47|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Hotchkiss gun]]s, QF {{convert|37|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} Hotchkiss revolving cannon, and {{convert|25|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} Palmcrantz-Nordenfelt guns.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 158</ref>

The ship had a complete waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] of [[wrought iron]] that was {{convert|4.5|in|mm|0}} thick amidships and thinned to {{convert|3.75|in|mm|0}} at the bow and {{convert|3.25|in}} at the stern. The armor was backed by {{convert|12|to|18|in}} of [[teak]]. The circular turrets were protected by armor {{convert|5.5|in}} thick and the walls of the ship's oval [[conning tower]] were also 4.5 inches thick. Her [[deck (ship)|deck]] was {{convert|1|in}} thick [[amidships]], but reduced to {{convert|0.25|-|0.5|in}} at the ends of the ship.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 158<U+2013>59</ref>

==Construction and service==
''Charodeika'' ([[Witchcraft|Sorceress]])<ref>Silverstone, p. 373</ref> was ordered on 26 January 1865 and construction began on 10 June at the [[Admiralty Shipyard]], [[Saint Petersburg]], although the formal [[keel]]-laying was not until 6 June 1866. She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 12 September 1867 and completed in 1869 at the cost of 762,000 [[Russian ruble|rubles]]. Construction was considerably delayed by late deliveries of drawings, material, and the death of her original builder. The ship served her entire career with the Baltic Fleet and was later assigned to the Mine (Torpedo) Training Detachment. ''Charodeika'' was reclassified as a [[coast defense ship|coast-defense]] [[ironclad]] on 13 February 1892 and remained in service until 31 March 1907 when she was turned over to the Port of [[Kronstadt]] for disposal. The ship was stricken from the [[Navy List]] on 7 April and was finally scrapped in 1911<U+2013>12.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 152, 155<U+2013>56, 160, 163</ref>
