== History ==
In the early [[19th century]], due to hunting for sport and the demand for body parts thought to be medicinal, the Alpine ibex only survived in the Gran Paradiso area. Approximately 60 individual ibex lived here.<ref name=Nowak>{{cite book |last=Nowak |first=Ronald M. |title=Walker's Mammals of the World |url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=7W-DGRILSBoC&dq |year=1999 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=0801857899 |pages=1224 }}</ref> Ibex were intensively hunted because their body parts were thought to have therapeutic properties.<ref name=Riley/> [[Talisman]]s were made was made from a small cross-shaped bone in the ibex's heart in order to protect against violent death.<ref name=Price>{{cite book |last=Price |first=Gillian |title=Walking in Italy's Gran Paradiso |url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=FhxKsmQyHXUC |year=1997 |publisher=Cicerone Press Limited |isbn=1852842318 |pages=13-16 }}</ref> Due to the alarming decrease in the ibex population, [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel]], soon to be [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|King of Italy]], declared the Royal Hunting Reserve of the Gran Paradiso in 1856. A protective guard was created for the ibex. Paths laid out for the ibex are still used today as part of 724 [[kilometre]]s (450 [[mile|mi]]) of marked trails and mule tracks.<ref name=Riley/>

In 1920 Victor Emmanuel II's grandson [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel III]] donated the park's original 21 [[square kilometre]]s (5,189 [[acre]]s),<ref name=Riley/> and the park was established in 1922.<ref name=sea/> It was Italy's first national park.<ref name=Mose>{{cite book |last=Mose |first=Ingo |title=Protected Areas and Regional Development in Europe |url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=fl3dR_WiuKwC |year=2007 |isbn=075464801X |pages=132 }}</ref> There were approximately 4,000 ibex in the park when it was protected.<ref name=Akitt>{{cite book |last=Akitt |first=James Wells |title=The Gran Paradiso and Southern Valdotain: The Long Distance Walks |url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=3_IDLRL1CLwC |year=1997 |publisher=Cicerone Press Limited |isbn=1852842474 |pages=51 }}</ref> Despite the presence of the park, ibex were [[poaching|poached]] until 1945, when only 419 remained. Their protection increased, and there are now almost 4,000 in the park.<ref name=Riley/>

== Geography ==
[[Image:Gran Paradiso.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gran Paradiso mountain.]]
The park is located in the [[Graian Alps]] in the regions of [[Piedmont|Piemonte]] and [[Aosta Valley|Valle d'Aosta]] in north-west Italy.<ref name=sea/><ref name=Price/> It encompasses 703 square kilometres (173,715 acres) of alpine terrain.<ref name=Riley/> 10% of the park's surface area is wooded. 16.5% is used for agriculture and pasture, 24% is uncultivated, and 40% is classified as sterile. 9.5% of the park's surface area is occupied by 57 [[glacier]]s.<ref name=Price/> The park's mountains and valleys were sculpted by glaciers and streams.<ref name=environments>{{cite web |url=http://www.pngp.it/page.asp?ART=269%02PGE=1%02COD=A%02SEL=55%02TIT=The%20Park%20environments |title=The Parc environments |accessdate=2008-03-12 |publisher=Parco Nazionale Gran Paradiso}}</ref> Altitudes in the park range from 800-4,061 [[metre]]s (2,624-13,323 [[Foot (length)|ft]]), with an average altitude of 2,000 metres (6,561 ft).<ref name=sea/> Valley floors in the park are forested. There are [[alpine meadow]]s at higher altitudes. There are rocks and glaciers at altitudes higher than the meadows.<ref name=environments/> Gran Paradiso is only mountain entirely with within Italy that is over 4,000 metres (13,123 ft) high.<ref name=Guardian/> [[Mont Blanc]] and the [[Matterhorn]] can be seen from its [[summit (topography)|summit]].<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news |first= Peter|last=Beaumont |title=Have skis, will travel |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2005/jan/30/observerescapesection5?page=3 |work=The Observer |date=2005-01-30 |accessdate=2008-03-12 }}</ref> In 1860, John Cowell became the first person to reach the summit.<ref name=Gilpin>{{cite book |last=Gilpin |first=Alan |title=Dictionary of Environmental Law |url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=bYJ303f2Z34C&dq |year=2000 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=1840641886 |pages=208 }}</ref> To the west, the park shares a boundary with [[France]]'s [[Vanoise National Park]].<ref name=sea/> Combined, the two parks form the largest protected area in [[Western Europe]].<ref name=Riley/> They co-operate in managing the ibex population, which moves across their shared boundary seasonally.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sandwith |first=Trevor |title=Transboundary Protected Areas for Peace and Co-operation |url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=FxmXNURjpJMC |year=2001 |publisher=The World Conservation Union |isbn=2831706122 |pages=66 }}</ref>

== Flora ==
The park's woods are important because they provide shelter for a large number of animals. They are a natural defence against [[landslide]]s, [[avalanche]]s, and [[flood]]ing. The two main types of woods found in the park are [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] and [[deciduous]] woods.<ref name=forests/> The deciduous [[European Beech|European beech]] forests are common on the Piemonte side of the park, and are not found on the dryer Valle d'Aosta side. These forests are thick with dense foliage that lets in very little light during the summer. The beech leaves take a long time to decompose, and they form a thick layer on the woodland floor that impedes the development of other plants and trees.<ref name=forests/> [[Larch]]es are the most common trees in the forests on the valley floors. They are mixed with [[spruce]]s, [[Swiss Pine|Swiss stone pine]]s, and more rarely [[Abies alba|silver firs]].<ref name=environments/>  

[[Acer pseudoplatanus|Maple]] and [[Tilia platyphyllos|lime]] forests are found in gulleys. These forests are only present in isolated areas and are at risk of extinction. [[Downy Oak|Downy oak]] woods are more common in the Valle d'Aosta area than in the Piemonte area because of its higher temperatures and lower precipitation. Oak is not a typical species in the park and it is often found mixed with [[Scots Pine|Scots pine]]. The park's [[chestnut]] groves have been effected by human cultivation for wood and fruit. It rarely grows above 1,000 metres (3,280 ft), and the most important chestnut forests are in the park's Piemonte side. The park's conifer woods include Scots pine groves, [[spruce]] forests dominated by the [[Norway Spruce|Norway spruce]], often mixed with [[larch]]. Larch and Swiss stone pine woods are found up to the highest sub-alpine level (2200-2300 metres (7,217-7,546 ft)).<ref name=forests>{{cite web |url=http://www.pngp.it/page.asp?ART=275&PGE=1&COD=A&SEL=55&TIT=The%20woods |title=The woods |accessdate=2008-03-12 |publisher=Parco Nazionale Gran Paradiso}}</ref>

At higher altitudes the trees gradually thin out and there are alpine pastures. These pastures are rich in flowers in the late spring.<ref name=environments/> The wildflowers in the park's high meadows include [[Viola tricolor|wild pansies]], [[gentian]]s, [[Lilium martagon|martagon lilies]], and [[Rhododendron ferrugineum|alpenrose]]s. These flowers attract large numbers of butterflies including [[Apollo (butterfly)|apollo]]s, [[Pontia callidice|peak white]]s, and southern [[Limenitis camilla|white admiral]]s.<ref name=Riley/> The park has many rocky habitats. They are mostly located above the timberline and alpine pastures. These areas have rock and [[detritus]] on their surface. [[Alpine plant]]s have adapted to these habitats by assuming characteristics like [[dwarfism]], hairiness, bright coloured flowers, and highly developed roots.<ref name=rocky>{{cite web |url=http://www.pngp.it/page.asp?ART=272&PGE=1&COD=A&SEL=55&TIT=Rocky%20environments |title=The rocky environments |accessdate=2008-03-12 |publisher=Parco Nazionale Gran Paradiso}}</ref> About 1,500 plant species can be seen at Paradisia Bontanical Garden near [[Cogne]] inside the park.<ref name=Riley/>

== Fauna ==
[[Image:2006-08-06 31.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Alpine ibex in Valle d'Aosta.]]
Ibex graze in the abundant mountain pastures in summer, and descend to lower elevations in winter.<ref name=Riley/> Gran Paradiso's pairing with Vanoise National Park provides year-round protection to the ibex.<ref name=Kiss>{{cite book |last=Kiss |first=Alexandre Charles |coauthors=Dinah Shelton |title=Manual of European Environmental Law |url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=Fws4AAAAIAAJ&dq |year=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521591228 |pages=198 }}</ref> Along with the ibex, the animal species found in the park include [[stoat|ermine]], [[weasel]], [[hare]],<ref name=Gilpin/> [[Eurasian Badger|Eurasian badger]], and alpine [[chamois]].<ref name=Riley/> The ibex and chamois spend most of the year above the [[tree line]]. They descend to the valleys in the winter and spring.<ref name=Belford/> Alpine [[marmot]]s forage on plants along the [[snow line]].<ref name=Riley/> 

There are more than 100 bird species in the park, including [[Eurasian Eagle-owl]]s, [[Ptarmigan|Rock Ptarmigan]]s, [[Alpine Accentor]]s, and [[Chough]]s. [[Golden Eagle]]s nest on rocky ledges, and sometimes in trees. [[Wallcreeper]]s are found on steep cliffs. There are red-crested black [[Woodpecker]]s and speckled [[Nutcracker (bird)|Nutcracker]]s in the park's woodlands.<ref name=Riley/>

== Tourism ==
The park is easily accessed by high-speed motorways linked to France and [[Switzerland]]. There are hotels and restaurants close to the park's borders. April to October are the favoured times for visitors. Families and casual visitors prefer the northern part of the park because of its higher mountains, more spectacular views, and plentiful hotels and picnic areas. Serious hikers travel in the southern valleys. Visitors can see grazing ibex and chamois at the Gran Piano di Noasca. Visitors can stay at campgrounds, refuges and mountain huts both in summer and winter.<ref name=Riley/> The park has nature trails of varying lengths and difficulty.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pngp.it/page.asp?ART=300&PGE=4&COD=D&SEL=58&TIT=Nature%20trails |title=Nature trails |accessdate=2008-03-12 |publisher=Parco Nazionale Gran Paradiso}}</ref> The park has become so popular with summer visitors that litter has become a problem, along with noise pollution and damage to trails and fragile habitats.<ref name=Riley/> [[Cross-country skiing|Cross-country skiers]] use the park during the winter.<ref name=Belford>{{cite book |last=Belford |first=Ros |url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=guMWMVFhqzwC |year=2003 |title=The Rough Guide to Italy |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=1843530600 |pages=100-101 }}</ref> There are controversial proposed building developments in and just outside the park.<ref name=Riley/>
