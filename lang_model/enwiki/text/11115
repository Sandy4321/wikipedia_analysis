== Intel Legal Threat ==

In June 2005, [[Intel|Intel Corp]]'s UK division threatened [[legal action]] against FotoInsight for trademark infringement <ref name="Intel Legal">{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/30/intel_inside_nastygram/|title=Your insides belong to us, Intel tells FotoInside|last=Cullen|first=Drew|date=June 20th 2005|publisher=The Register|language=English|accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref> due to FotoInsight's use of the name slogan "The 'INSIDE' format" which Intel argued that it had coined when it started using the [[slogan]] "Intel Inside" for computers with their processors in 1991 <ref name="Intel Legal" />. FotoInsight eventually backed down and changed their slogan <ref name="Intel Legal" /> to "FotoInsight Limited" partially due to the differences of [[trademark law]] in the over 20 [[EU]] member countries they were attempting to set up business in <ref name="Intel Legal" />.  In addition, Intel's threat of legal action against FotoInsight resulted in a form of the [[Streisand effect]] for FotoInsight and resulted in a large increase of brand recognition, notoriety and business due to the press coverage of the action by Intel <ref name="Intel Legal" />.

== Google Earth Integration ==

FotoInsight also has the option to take images taken from [[Google Earth]] and print and ship them in individual photographic prints <ref name="Google Earth">{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2006/03/06/cartoline-postali-dalle-immagini-satellitari.html|title=Cartoline postali dalle immagini satellitari (English: Postcards from images satellite)|date=March 6th 2006|publisher=La Repubblica.it|language=Italian|accessdate=2 January 2010|location=Italy}}</ref>.  PhotoInsight also offers the options of taking Photographs from Google Earth and, making them into [[postcard]]s or [[greeting cards]], using other Google Earth photographs or user supplied [[photograph]]s <ref name="Google Earth" />.
