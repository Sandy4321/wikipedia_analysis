'''Barber<U+00EA>che''' is a [[Municipalities of Switzerland|municipality]] in the district of [[Lac (district)|Lac]] in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Fribourg (canton)|Fribourg]]. It lies on the "language boundary" between the [[French language|French]]- and German-speaking parts of [[Switzerland]], and so also bears a German name: '''B<U+00E4>rfischen'''. In [[2003]] its population was 574.

==Geography==
Barber<U+00EA>che lies 569 m above [[sea level]], and is 5.5 km north of the cantonal capital, [[Fribourg]] (Freiburg). The surrounding rural municipality stretches along the north shore of the [[Schiffenensee]], a small lake through which flows the river [[Saane/Sarine]], at the foot of the ''Grand Bois'' ("Great Wood") hill on the [[Swiss plateau]]. Barber<U+00EA>che's co<U+00F6>rdinates are {{coor dm|46|51|N|7|10|E|region:CH}}.

The municipality's area is [[1 E6 m<U+00B2>|9.1 km<U+00B2>]], and includes a part of the Swiss plateau's [[Swiss plateau#Geology|molasse uplands]]. The sprawling, yet narrow, area is bordered on the southeast by the Schiffenensee. All along this [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]]'s shoreline in the Barber<U+00EA>che area is a 20- to 50-m-high [[dike (construction)|dike]] topped with trees, broken here and there by [[sandstone]] [[cliffs]]. Several [[gully|gullies]] carved by [[erosion]] empty into the [[lake]]; these have been partially flooded owing to the creation of the reservoir. The gullies divide the terrace that Barber<U+00EA>che is built on into several small [[plateau]]x, which themselves are abutted in the northwest by the molasse hill.

In the farthest south and southwest, the municipality area reaches beyond the [[Courtepin Valley]] to the flats at the mouth of the stream La Sonnaz where it empties into the Schiffenensee. From here westwards, the district stretches to the Bois de la Corbaz (a wood), which reaches 650 m above sea level, and to the edge of the Bois de l'H<U+00F4>pital ("Hospital Wood") (660 m above sea level). Towards the northeast, the municipality stretches over the Breilles Heights &mdash; which at 668 m above sea level are Barber<U+00EA>che's highest point &mdash; the Bouley Forest, and the Grand Bois, as well as the Bulliardholz (another wood; 660 m), and on to the foot of the "Great Wood" (''Grossholz'') at [[Kleingurmels]].

French has been the majority language in Barber<U+00EA>che since about [[1860]].

==Economy==
Barber<U+00EA>che was until the second half of the [[20th century]] a village whose livelihood was firmly rooted in [[agriculture]]. Even today, tilling the soil, growing fruit, and raising cattle are important to the local economy. Other jobs are to be found in [[small business]] and the [[service sector]]. There is a commercial area in Pensier. Until [[1976]], there was a [[boarding school]] at Barber<U+00EA>che (Institut Saint-Dominique).

==History==
The Barber<U+00EA>che area was settled quite early on, as witnessed by [[archaeology|archaeological]] finds of graves from [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt times]] and foundations from [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]].

The first documentary mention of Barber<U+00EA>che dates from [[1154]] under the name ''Barbereschi''. Later names included ''Barberesche'' ([[1173]]), ''Barbaresche'' ([[1180]]), ''Barbareschi'' ([[1182]]) and ''Barbarica'' ([[1423]]). The placename goes back to an old family name ''Barbar(i)us''.

There is evidence to show that, as of the [[12th century]], there was a [[Nobility|noble]] family in Barber<U+00EA>che. The Barber<U+00EA>che [[Lord]]ship fell in the beginning under the [[Duke]]s of [[Z<U+00E4>hringen]], and then later became a [[fiefdom]] of the [[Counts of Thierstein]], before a series of changes in ownership in the [[15th century]]. In [[1442]], Barber<U+00EA>che became part of the ''Alte Landschaft'' ("Old Territory") of Fribourg (Spitalpanner). After the collapse of the ''[[Ancien R<U+00E9>gime]]'' in [[1798]], during the [[Helvetic Republic]] and the time following, the village belonged to the District of Fribourg, and from [[1831]] to the German District of Fribourg, before it was annexed to the Seebezirk ("Lake District") under the new cantonal [[constitution]] in [[1848]].

==Sightseeing==

The oldest parts of the [[parish]] [[church]] of Saint Maurice date back to the [[11th century]]. It was enlarged in [[1785]]-[[1786|86]] and underwent modifications in the 19th century. It has a [[quire]] with a semicircular [[apse]] and overhanging arcades in early [[mediaeval]] style. The church contains wall paintings from the 18th century, [[wood carving|woodcarvings]], and [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] in the [[stained glass]]. The [[parsonage]] next to the church dates from [[1566]].


On the edge of the plateau, right above the Schiffenensee, stands Barber<U+00EA>che Castle. It was built between [[1522]] and [[1528]], likely on the site of an earlier [[fortification]], under Petermann de Praroman's direction in the late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. From [[1839]] until [[1844]], the castle underwent considerable [[remodeling]], whereby the castle took its current shape in the [[neo-Gothic]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] styles. The castle is today privately owned.

Furthermore, over the dike surrounding the Schiffenensee, northeast of Barber<U+00EA>che, stands Petit-Vivy castle. It is among the oldest preserved castles in the region. The still-preserved, mighty, four-sided [[keep]] was built in the second half of the [[13th century]], and has 3.5-m-thick walls. Around the keep are the remains of former surrounding walls, arranged in triangular form. The residential buildings were built in the [[16th century]].

Farther northeast is Grand-Vivy castle on a narrow outcrop between the Schiffenensee and a small sidestream. This was also the site of a mediaeval castle, but this was replaced by today's late-Gothic structure with its semicircular stairway tower, and other tower construction. The [[chapel]] next to the castle was built in the 19th century.
