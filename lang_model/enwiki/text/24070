'''St Andrew's Church''' is a former [[Church of England|Anglican]] church in the [[Brunswick (Hove)|Brunswick Town]] area of [[Hove]], part of the English city of [[Brighton and Hove]].  Although declared redundant in 1990,<ref name="Redundant">{{cite web|title=The Church of England Statistics & Information: Lists (by diocese) of redundant church buildings whose futures have been settled as at April 2006|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/churchcommissioners/redchurches/stats/chichester.doc|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=Church of England|year=2006|work=The Church of England website}}</ref> it was one of the area's most fashionable places of worship in the 19th century, when it was built to serve the wealthy residents of the Brunswick estate and surrounding areas, and it is [[Listed building|listed]] at Grade I<ref name="IoEStAndrewWSH">{{cite web|title=Images of England <U+2014> detailed record, Church of St Andrew including walls, railings and gates, Waterloo Street (east side), Hove|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=365656&mode=quick|work=[[Images of England]]|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|year=2007|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref><U+2014>a designation used for buildings "of outstanding architectural or historic interest".  The church is unrelated to Hove's former parish church [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|of the same name]], on Church Road.

==History==
The area between Brighton, to the east, and the ancient centre of Hove, to the west, was farmland until the 1820s, when Brunswick Town was developed in response to the success of the [[Kemp Town]] estate in Brighton<U+2014>a planned estate of high-class houses, servants' quarters and other buildings, all in the [[Regency architecture|Regency style]].  Architect [[Charles Busby]] planned and built the Brunswick Town estate, which (together with other nearby residential development) helped the population of Hove to rise from 100 in 1801 to 2,500 in 1841.<ref name="Dale70">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p70 }}</ref>

The only church nearby was [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's, the ancient parish church]]; this was some distance away and had fallen into near-dereliction.  The curate of the (now demolished) St Margaret's Church in Cannon Place, Brighton, Rev. Edward Everard, owned some land near the former Wick Farm, on which the Brunswick Town estate had been built.  He was aware that there was no plan to build a church in the estate, so he decided to build a [[Chapel#Proprietary_chapels|proprietary chapel]] on his land.<ref name="Dale66">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p66 }}</ref><ref name="roughwood4">{{cite web|title=St Andrew, Waterloo Street, Hove, Sussex <U+2014> 4th May 2005|url=http://www.roughwood.net/ChurchAlbum/EastSussex/Hove/HoveWaterlooSt2005.htm|accessdate=2008-01-02|publisher=Mark Collins|year=2007|work=The Roughwood website}}</ref><ref name="EncH&P35">{{cite book |last=Middleton |first=Judy |title=The Encyclopaedia of Hove & Portslade |origyear=2002 |series=Volume 12: S Part 1 |publisher=Brighton & Hove Libraries |location=Brighton |pages=p35 }}</ref>  Rev. Everard knew [[Charles Busby]], but they had fallen out after a disagreement in 1824 over the commission for the [[Royal Sussex County Hospital|Sussex County Hospital]] (now the Royal Sussex County Hospital) in Brighton: Everard was overruled by other members of the planning committee and had to break his promise that Busby would be allowed to design it.  Therefore, Everard looked for a different architect to design and build the church, and [[Charles Barry]]<U+2014>who had already built the hospital and [[St Peter's Church, Brighton|St Peter's Church]] in Brighton<U+2014>was chosen.<ref name="EncH&P35"/>

Construction started in April 1827.  Everard was granted an [[Act of Parliament]] on [[3 April]] [[1828]] giving him and his successors ownership of the church, the right to appoint a [[curate]] for the next 40 years, and two-thirds of income from pew rents and other sources.  Everard himself acted as the first curate, from the church's consecration on [[5 July]] [[1828]] until 1838, one year before his death.<ref name="roughwood4"/><ref name="Dale67"/>  

St Andrew's immediately became popular with the fashionable set, helped by the regular presence of members of the Royal Family and the aristocracy.  Among the many [[Duke]]s and [[Duchess]]es to worship there in the mid-19th century was the elderly [[Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge]], who often made loud and sometimes eccentric comments and remarks during services.<ref name="EncH&P36">{{cite book |last=Middleton |first=Judy |title=The Encyclopaedia of Hove & Portslade |origyear=2002 |series=Volume 12: S Part 1 |publisher=Brighton & Hove Libraries |location=Brighton |pages=p36 }}</ref>  Between 300 and 350 people regularly worshipped at the church in 1851 according to a census taken during that year; there were 420 pews, 340 of which were subject to pew rents.<ref name="EncH&P36"/>

The interior was reordered in 1869, with new open benches installed in place of individual seats.<ref name="EncH&P36"/>  A more radical change took place in 1882,<ref name="IoEStAndrewWSH">{{cite web|title=Images of England <U+2014> detailed record, Church of St Andrew including walls, railings and gates, Waterloo Street (east side), Hove|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=365656&mode=quick|work=[[Images of England]]|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|year=2007|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref> when the church was extended at a cost of <U+00A3>7,000 (<U+00A3>2,000 to buy and demolish an adjacent stable block and <U+00A3>5,000 for the construction work);<ref name="Dale70">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p70 }}</ref><ref name="Dale68">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p68 }}</ref> Charles Barry's son [[Edward Middleton Barry]] added a chancel, a sanctuary with [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]], an illuminated dome and space for an organ.  Although the organ is no longer in place, its case has been retained.<ref name="roughwood4"/><ref name="Dale68"/>  A [[pulpit]] had been donated in 1918,<ref name="IoEStAndrewWSH"/> and more additions were made in the 1920s, including enlargements to the altar case, a pedimented [[Baldachin|baldacchino]] above the altar, a marble font with its own baldacchino, new stained glass windows and new, clearer [[Venice|Venetian]] glass surrounding these.  The changes cost <U+00A3>4,000.<ref name="IoEStAndrewWSH"/><ref name="Dale70"/><ref name="roughwood4"/>  The stated intention was to brighten the interior of the church and "create a little piece of Italy" within the [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] building.<ref name="EncH&P36"/>

The church remained in use until the late 20th century, but was declared redundant on [[14 February]] [[1990]] because of declining attendance at services.<ref name="Redundant">{{cite web|title=The Church of England Statistics & Information: Lists (by diocese) of redundant church buildings whose futures have been settled as at April 2006|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/churchcommissioners/redchurches/stats/chichester.doc|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=Church of England|year=2006|work=The Church of England website}}</ref><ref name="Dale70">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p70 }}</ref>  The decline had set in several decades earlier, and the Diocese were considering demolition; the granting of Grade I-listed status on [[24 March]] [[1950]] meant this could not happen.<ref name="EncH&P36"/>  The [[Churches Conservation Trust]] now owns and maintains the building.<ref name="EncH&P36"/> Damage was caused by squatters during the 1990s, but restoration work in 2001 and 2002, costing more than <U+00A3>100,000, allowed the building to be reopened for occasional services, special events and community activities.<ref name="EncH&P37">{{cite book |last=Middleton |first=Judy |title=The Encyclopaedia of Hove & Portslade |origyear=2002 |series=Volume 12: S Part 1 |publisher=Brighton & Hove Libraries |location=Brighton |pages=p37 }}</ref>

The church was always unparished, having been built as a [[chapel of ease]] to St Andrew's in Church Road.<ref name="Building14A">{{cite book |others=School of Architecture and Interior Design, Brighton Polytechnic |title=A Guide to the Buildings of Brighton |origyear=1987 |publisher=McMillan Martin |location=Macclesfield |isbn=1-869-86503-0 |pages=p113 }}</ref>

==Architecture==
The exterior, facing west, is the first example in England of the [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]] being used on a church.<ref name="IoEStAndrewWSH"/><ref name="EncH&P35"/><ref name="Dale67">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p67 }}</ref>  Originally, the interior was less grand, with no [[chancel]], simple [[pulpit]]s and a single gallery,<ref name="roughwood4"/><ref name="Dale67"/> making it a plain, box-like preaching-house.<ref name="EncH&P36"/>  The building materials used for the exterior are brick and [[ashlar]].  The entrance door is set beneath a round-headed arched opening between twin [[pilaster]]s, the outer pair of which serve as [[Quoin (architecture)|quoins]] for the adjacent recessed walls.<ref name="IoEStAndrewWSH"/>  There is a small domed bell tower with a lead roof and clock faces,<ref name="IoEStAndrewWSH"/> containing a bell cast in 1930 as a replacement for an early 19th-century predecessor (this bore an inscription dated 1811).<ref name="EncH&P39">{{cite book |last=Middleton |first=Judy |title=The Encyclopaedia of Hove & Portslade |origyear=2002 |series=Volume 12: S Part 1 |publisher=Brighton & Hove Libraries |location=Brighton |pages=p39 }}</ref>

In its present form, the interior consists of a gallery at the west end, [[nave]], [[transept]]s on two sides, a [[chancel]], a side chapel in the southeast corner and a [[vestry]] in the northeast, with Italianate top-lighting and domes.  The [[narthex]], from where a stone staircase leads up to the gallery, is also top-lit, and now contains most of the church's memorial stones;<ref name="IoEStAndrewWSH"/> these were moved there from the body of the church after it was declared redundant.  Five, including memorials commemorating [[Lord Charles Somerset]] and [[Sir George Dallas, 1st Baronet]], remain in the nave, however.<ref name="EncH&P37"/>

St Andrew's is the only church in Hove to have [[Burial vault (tomb)|burial vaults]] beneath it.  Space for burials was restricted in the Brunswick Town area by the time the church was built, because of the rapid residential development, and the churchyard at St Andrew's on Church Road was difficult to get to.  [[Lord Charles Somerset]], an [[Member of Parliament|M.P.]] who later became Governor of the [[Cape Colony]] in [[South Africa]], was the first person to be buried in the vault, in 1831.<ref name="EncH&P385">{{cite book |last=Middleton |first=Judy |title=The Encyclopaedia of Hove & Portslade |origyear=2002 |series=Volume 12: S Part 1 |publisher=Brighton & Hove Libraries |location=Brighton |pages=p38 }}</ref>  A court order in 1854 prevented any more burials being made, and the vaults were used as [[air raid shelter]]s during [[World War II]].<ref name="EncH&P39"/>
