The '''Urial''' ('''''Ovis orientalis vignei'' group'''<ref>ICZN ([[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]]) [http://www.iczn.org/BZNMar2003opinions.htm opinion 2027]</ref>), also known as the '''Arkars''' or '''Shapo''', is a subspecies group of the wild [[Ovis|sheep]] ''Ovis orientalis''. Noticeable features are the reddish-brown long fur that fades during winter; males are characterized by a black ruff stretching from the neck to the chest and large horns.  It is found in western [[central Asia]].  The other subspecies group of ''O. orientalis'' is the [[Mouflon]] (''Ovis orientalis orientalis'' group). The two groups have often been considered separate species.<ref>Grubb, Peter (2005). Order Perissodactyla. Pp. 708-710 in: Wilson, Don E., and DeeAnn, M. (2005). ''Mammal Species of the World. A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference''. 3d edition. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore. ISBN 0-8018-8221-4</ref> 

== Physical characteristics ==
Urial males have large horns, curling outwards from the top of the head turning in to end somewhere behind the head; females have shorter, compressed horns. The horns of the males may be up to {{Convert|100|cm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} long. The [[shoulder]] height of an adult male Urial is between {{Convert|80|and|90|cm|in|sigfi=2|abbr=on}}.

== Distribution ==
The Urial is found in western central [[Asia]] from northeastern [[Iran]] and  western [[Kazakhstan]] to [[Pakistan]]'s [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]] and [[Ladakh]]. 
To the east it is replaced by the bigger [[Argali]] and to the southwest by the [[Asiatic Mouflon]].
Its habitat consists of [[grass]]y slopes below the [[tree line|timberline]]. Urials rarely move to the rocky areas of the mountains.
For example in northern Iran they produce hybrids with Asiatic mouflon under natural conditions.
Urials feed mainly on grass but are able to eat leaves of trees and bushes if needed.

The [[conservation status]] of the Urial is threatened as their habitat is perfectly suitable for [[human]] development; however the Urial [[population]] has been recovering in recent years.

== Behaviour ==
The [[mating]] season begins in September. Rams (which live separately at other times) select four or five ewes, who will give each birth to a lamb after a [[gestation]] of five months.

== Subspecies ==
The ''vignei'' subspecies group consists of six individual subspecies:

*'''Afghan Urial''' or '''Turkmenian sheep''' (''Ovis orientalis cycloceros''): southern [[Turkmenistan]], eastern [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], north Balochistan<ref>http://www.un.org.pk/undp/sgp/green-pioneers/chap-13.htm</ref> and northern [[Pakistan]], [[Kashmir]]  
*'''Transcaspian Urial''' (''Ovis orientalis arkal''): Ustjurt-Plateau ([[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], northern [[Iran]]) and western [[Kazakhstan]] 
*'''Blanford Urial''' or '''Balochistan Urial''' (''[[Ovis orientalis blanfordi]]''): [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]] are often included in this subspecies.
*'''Bukhara Urial''' (''Ovis orientalis bochariensis''): [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], mountains around [[Amu Darya]]
*'''Punjab Urial''' (''[[Ovis orientalis punjabiensis]]''): the provincial animal of the [[Punjab (Pakistan)]]
*'''Ladakh Urial''' (''[[Ovis orientalis vignei]]''): [[Ladakh]] males have curly horns but the females have flat horns
