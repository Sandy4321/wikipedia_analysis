A '''high-pressure area''' is a region where the [[atmospheric pressure]] at the surface of the planet is greater than its surrounding environment.  Winds within high-pressure areas flow outward due to the higher density air near their center and friction with land.  Due to the [[Coriolis effect]], winds flow [[clockwise]] around a high-pressure area located in the [[northern hemisphere]] and [[counter-clockwise]] ([[British English|BE]]: anticlockwise) around one in the [[southern hemisphere]].  The resulting [[weather system]] is called an [[anticyclone]].  High-pressure areas are generally associated with cooler, drier air as well as clearing skies due to their formation within areas of atmospheric subsidence, or areas of large scale air descent.   The strongest high-pressure areas are associated with arctic air masses during the winter, which modify and weaken once they move over relatively warmer water bodies.  The area of high pressure associated with the descending branch of the [[Hadley cell]], known as the [[subtropical ridge]], steer [[tropical wave]]s and [[tropical cyclone]]s across the ocean and is strongest during the summer.  The subtropical ridge also helps form most the world's [[desert]]s.  Arctic high-pressure systems weaken with height, while subtropical ridges strengthen with height.  On [[English language|English-language]] [[weather map]]s, high-pressure centers are identified by the letter H.  Weather maps in other languages may use different letters or symbols.

High-pressure systems form due to downward motion through the [[troposphere]], the [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] layer where [[weather]] occurs.  Preferred areas within a [[synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic]] flow pattern in higher levels of the troposphere are beneath the western side of troughs.  On weather maps, these areas show converging winds (isotachs), also known as [[confluence]], or converging height lines near or above the level of non-divergence, which is near the 500 hPa pressure surface about midway up through the troposphere.<ref>Glossary of Meteorology (2009).

Some climatological high-pressure areas acquire regionally based names. The land-based [[Siberian High]] often remains quasi-stationary for more than a month during the most frigid time of the year, making it unique in that regard.  It is also a bit larger and more persistent than its counterpart in [[North America]].<ref>W. T. Sturges (1991).

==Connection to wind==
{{Main|Geostrophic wind}}
[[Wind]] flows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure.<ref>BWEA (2007). [http://www.bwea.com/edu/wind.html Education and Careers: What is wind?] British Wind Energy Association. Retrieved on 2009-02-16.</ref>  This is due to [[density]] differences between the two [[air mass]]es.  Since stronger high-pressure systems contain cooler or drier air, the air mass is more dense and flows towards areas that are warm or moist, which are in the vicinity of low pressure areas in advance of their associated [[cold front]]s.  The stronger the pressure difference, or pressure gradient, between a high-pressure system and a low pressure system, the stronger the wind. The [[coriolis force]] caused by the [[Earth]]'s rotation is what gives winds within high-pressure systems their clockwise circulation in the northern hemisphere (as the wind moves outward and is deflected right from the center of high pressure) and counterclockwise circulation in the southern hemisphere (as the wind moves outward and is deflected left from the center of high pressure).  Friction with land slows down the wind flowing out of high-pressure systems and causes wind to flow more outward, or flowing more [[geostrophic wind|ageostrophically]], from their centers.<ref>JetStream (2008).
