"'''Deepest Shame'''" is a hip-hop song composed and performed by British rapper [[Plan B (musician)|Plan B]]. The track was released in the [[United Kingdom]] on 9 September 2012 as the third official single from the ''[[Ill Manors (album)|ill Manors]]'' soundtrack, a film which [[Plan B (musician)|Plan B]] also directed. The track was originally composed as a freestyle rap, entitled "Michelle", and later reworked into a soul number for inclusion in ''[[Ill Manors]]''.

==Composition==
"Deepest Shame" was first composed as a freestyle rap entitled "Michelle". The track was first used in Ben Drew's 2008 short film ''Michelle'', and this version features beatboxer Faith SFX. The version of "Michelle" that was used in ''ill Manors'' has some elements similar to "Deepest Shame"; however, for the album release, the song was re-written as more of a soul number, although "Michelle" is included on the deluxe edition bonus disc. "Michelle" was originally a freestyle rap, featuring an extended rap verse and no "Deepest Shame" chorus. However, in the final version, the extension of the verse was taken out, replaced by a new first verse which is sung, rather than rapped, and some lyrics of the original rap were modified for radio use.

==Release==
The song was premiered on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]'' on 11 May 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGyAJSHRRtY |title=Plan B - Deepest Shame (Later... with Jools Holland) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-05-11}}</ref> The [[Andy C]] remix of the track, which serves as the official single remix, was uploaded to UKF Drum & Bass on 2 September 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy5uI4Rctuo |title=Plan B - Deepest Shame (Andy C Remix) |publisher=YouTube |date=2 September 2012 |accessdate=2012-09-03}}</ref> The Cinematic remix received its worldwide premiere on [[MistaJam]]'s [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] show on the same day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://soundcloud.com/cinematic/plan-b-deepest-shame-cinematic |title=Plan B 'Deepest Shame' (Cinematic Remix) - World exclusive BBC Radio 1Xtra rip |publisher=Soundcloud |date=3 September 2012 |accessdate=2012-09-08}}</ref> An [[iTunes Store]] pre-order link confirmed the final track listing of the digital single,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itunes.apple.com/gb/preorder/ill-manors-deluxe-version/id535592210 |title=iTunes - Music - ill Manors (Deluxe Version) by Plan B |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref> and in a similar format to the ''[[Ill Manors (song)|ill Manors]]'' EP, contains three remixes, an a cappella version and an instrumental.
