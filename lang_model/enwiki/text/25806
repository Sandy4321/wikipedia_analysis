Harwich was first settled in [[1670]] as the eastern parish of the town of Yarmouth.

The town is considered by some to be the birthplace of the cranberry industry, with the first commercial operation opened in 1846.  There are still many bogs in the town, although the economy is now more centered on tourism and as a residential/retirement community.  The town is also the site of the start/finish line of the "Sail Around the Cape," which rounds the Cape counter-clockwise, returning via the [[Cape Cod Canal]].<ref>''Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Street Atlas.''
