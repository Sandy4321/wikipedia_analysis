'''Marion Lois Jones''' (born October 12, 1975), also known as '''Marion Jones-Thompson''', is a former world champion [[Track and field|track and field athlete]], and a former professional basketball player for [[Tulsa Shock]] in the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]]. She won five medals at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in [[Sydney, Australia]], but forfeited all medals and prizes dating back to September 2000 after her October 2007 admission that she took performance-enhancing drugs as far back as the 2000 Summer Olympics, and that she had lied about it to a [[grand jury]] investigating performance-enhancer creations by Victor Conte and the [[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative]] (a.k.a. BALCO).<ref name="IOC Strips"/><ref name="JonesReturnsMedals">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/sports/jones+returns+2000+olympic+medals/896857|title=Jones Returns 2000 Olympic Medals|publisher=Channel4.com|accessdate=October 8, 2007}}</ref>

At the time of her admission and subsequent guilty plea, Marion Jones was one of the most famous people to be linked to the BALCO investigation.<ref name=NYT20071005/> 41 days later, [[Major League Baseball]] player [[Barry Bonds]] was indicted on one count of obstruction of justice and four counts of perjury linked to his own testimony before the BALCO grand jury in December 2003.<ref name="nytperjury">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/15/sports/baseball/15cnd-bonds.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&pagewanted=print|title=Barry Bonds Is Indicted for Perjury Tied to Drug Case|accessdate=2007-11-15|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 15, 2007|first=Michael S.|last=Schmidt}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Jones was born to Marion (who is [[Belizean]]) and George Jones (who is [[African American]]) in [[Los Angeles, California]]. She holds dual citizenship with the [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Belize]] (her mother's home
country).<ref name="fastestwoman">{{cite journal|accessdate=2008-02-10|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/marionjones1.html|title=Marion Jones: Fastest Woman on Earth|author=Rowen, Beth; Ross, Shmuel; Olson, Liz|year=2007|work=InfoPlease Database}}</ref> Her parents split when she was very young, and Jones' mother remarried a retired postal worker, Ira Toler, three years later; Toler became a [[stay-at-home dad]] to Jones and her older half-brother, Albert Kelly, until his sudden death in 1987.<ref name="FiveGolds">{{cite news|title=Jones Relays Thoughts on Chance for 5 Golds|last=Hersh|first=Philip|date=September 24, 2000|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|page=15}}</ref> Jones turned to sports (running, pickup basketball games, and anything else her brother Albert was doing athletically) as an outlet for her grief,<ref name="FiveGolds"/> and by the age of 15 she was routinely dominating California high school athletics both on the track and the basketball courts.

Jones is a 1997 graduate of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. While there, she met and began dating one of the track coaches, [[shot put]]ter [[C.J. Hunter]]. Hunter was forced to resign his position at UNC due to university rules prohibiting coach/athlete dating. Jones and Hunter were married October 3, 1998, and trained for the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics]] with their new athletic coach [[Trevor Graham]]. Graham would later gain notoriety for his role in providing both athletes with [[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative]] (BALCO) designer steroids ("The Cream" and "The Clear"), undetectable at the time, as well as providing a sample of BALCO's most successful product ("The Clear") to the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]] (USADA), where it was identified as [[tetrahydrogestrinone]] (THG) and a detection method was developed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Doping scandal has hushed side|date=August 24, 2004|first=John|last=Jeansonne|newspaper=The Chicago Tribune|page=5}}</ref>

In the run-up to the 2000 Olympics, all eyes were on Marion Jones, who had announced at a press conference during her pre-Olympic book-signing tour that she intended to win gold medals in all five of her competition events at Sydney. Lost in the hoopla and the publicity was a low-key announcement that Jones' husband C.J. Hunter had quietly withdrawn from the Shot Put competition due to a knee injury, though he was allowed to keep his coaching credentials and attend the games to support his wife. However, just hours after Marion Jones won her first of the planned five golds, the IOC announced that Hunter had failed no fewer than four pre-Olympic drug tests, testing positive each time for the banned anabolic steroid [[nandrolone]]. Hunter was immediately suspended from taking any role at the Sydney games, and he was ordered to surrender his on-field coaching credentials. At a press conference where Hunter broke down in tears as a subdued Marion Jones sat by his side, Hunter denied taking any performance enhancing drugs at all, much less the easily-detected nandrolone (which showed up in all four tests in amounts over 1000 times normal levels);<ref name="cjhunter">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-02-10|url=http://static.espn.go.com/oly/summer00/news/2000/0925/777764.html|title=IOC chief says Hunter failed four drug tests|date=2000-09-25|author=Associated Press|work=ESPN.com}}</ref> Victor Conte of BALCO, who was regularly supplying "nutritional supplements" to Graham's athletes, blamed the test results on "an iron supplement" that contained nandrolone precursors<ref name="fastestwoman" /> and tied previous positive nandrolone tests from Jamaican sprinter [[Merlene Ottey]] and British sprinter [[Linford Christie]] to the same supplement.<ref name="cjhunter">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-02-10|url=http://static.espn.go.com/oly/summer00/news/2000/0925/777764.html|title=IOC chief says Hunter failed four drug tests|date=2000-09-25|work=Associated Press}}</ref> As late as 2004, Hunter was still denying the charges and was attempting to gain access to the results to see if they could be analyzed further.<ref name=Webby2004>{{cite news |accessdate=2007-11-16

The couple divorced in 2002.

On June 28, 2003, Jones gave birth to a son (Tim Montgomery Jr.) with then-boyfriend [[Tim Montgomery]], a world class sprinter himself. Because of her [[pregnancy]], Jones missed the 2003 World Championships, but spent a year preparing for the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympics]]. Montgomery, who did not qualify for the 2004 Olympic Track and Field team due to poor performance, was charged by USADA, as part of the investigation into the [[BALCO]] doping scandal, with receiving and using banned performance enhancing drugs and sought a four-year suspension for Montgomery. Montgomery fought the ban but lost the appeal on December 13, 2005, receiving a two-year ban from track and field competition; the Court for Arbitration of Sport (CAS) also stripped Montgomery of all race results, records, medals, etc., from March 31, 2001 onward. Montgomery later announced his retirement. The investigation into Montgomery's illegal substance use once more called into question Marion Jones' own protests about not using steroids and never having been tested positive for steroids, especially in light of former trainer Trevor Graham's increasingly visible role in the BALCO case.

On February 24, 2007, Marion Jones married [[Barbados|Bajan]] sprinter and 2000 Olympic medalist (bronze, 100 m sprint) [[Obadele Thompson]].<ref name=Cherry2007>{{cite news|accessdate=|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idUSL0725699120070307|title=Sprinters Jones and Thompson married, says minister|date=March 7, 2007|author=Cherry, Gene|publisher=Reuters}}</ref> Their first child together was born in July 2007.<ref name=CNN20071005>{{cite news|accessdate=

== Sports career ==
===Track and field===
In high school, Jones won the [[CIF California State Meet]] in the [[100 metres|100 m sprint]] four years in a row, representing [[Rio Mesa High School|Rio Mesa]] the first two years and [[Thousand Oaks High School|Thousand Oaks high schools]] the last two. She was successfully defended by attorney [[Johnnie Cochran]] on charges of doping during her high school track career.<ref name=Patrick2007>{{cite news|accessdate=

She was invited to participate in the 1992 Olympic trials, and, after her showing in the [[200 meters]] finals, would have made the team as an alternate in the [[4 x 100 metres relay|4<U+00D7>100 meters relay]], but she declined the invitation. After winning further statewide [[Sprint (running)|sprint]] titles, she accepted a full scholarship to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] in [[North Carolina Tar Heels|basketball]], where she helped the team win the [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA championship]] in [[1994 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament|her freshman year]]. Jones [[Redshirt (college sports)|"red shirted"]] her 1996 basketball season to concentrate on track. After Jones lost her spot on the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympic]] team because of an [[injury]], she decided to concentrate on [[track and field]].

[[File:Tgalindo-100sevilla99.jpg|thumb|300px|Marion Jones (far left) during the [[1999 World Championships in Athletics|1999 World Championships]]]]

She excelled at her first major international competition, winning the 100&nbsp;m sprint at the [[1997 World Championships in Athletics|1997 World Championships]] in [[Athens]], while finishing 10th in the [[long jump]]. At the [[1999 World Championships in Athletics|1999 World Championships]], Jones attempted to win four titles, but injured herself in the 200&nbsp;m after a gold in the 100&nbsp;m and a long jump bronze.

Then in Sydney, Jones told the press that she was aiming for five gold medals. As it was considered a possibility by fans and pundits alike, she was a media darling during the Olympics. However, she finished with three golds and two bronzes, still an astonishing feat which had never been achieved by a female athlete before. She was later stripped of these medals after admitting that she used [[performance-enhancing drugs]] at the time. Her ex-husband Hunter, an Olympic [[Shot put|shot-putter]] and confessed steroid user, testified under oath that he had seen her inject drugs into her stomach in the [[Olympic Village]] in Sydney, and her coach [[Trevor Graham]] was involved in a major drug scandal that broke in 2005, which implicated baseball player [[Barry Bonds]], sprinters [[Tim Montgomery]], [[Chryste Gaines]], [[Kelli White]], and others, many of whom admitted to using illegal drugs while competing. Jones vehemently denied using performance-enhancing drugs until her confession in 2007.

A dominant force in women's sprinting, Jones was upset in the 100&nbsp;m sprint at the [[2001 World Championships in Athletics|2001 World Championships]], as [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Zhanna Pintusevich-Block]] beat her for her first loss in the event in six years; Pintusevich-Block was one of the names revealed by [[Victor Conte]] during the BALCO scandals. Jones, however, did claim the gold in both the 200&nbsp;m and 4x100&nbsp;m relay.

On her [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympics]] experience, Jones said "It's extremely disappointing, words can't put it into perspective."<ref name=SI2004Olympics>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/olympics/2004/08/28/bc.olympics/
|title=Friday: Bad day for U.S.; new dawn for China|author=Reuters|date=August 28, 2004|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]: 2004 Olympic Games|publisher=sportsillustrated.com}}</ref> She came in fifth in the [[Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Women's Long Jump|Long Jump]] and competed in the [[Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Women's 4 x 100 metres relay|women's 4x100&nbsp;m relay]] where they swept past the competition in the preliminaries only to miss a baton pass in the final race. Jones promised that her latest defeat would not be the end of her Olympic efforts, and reasserted in May 2005 that winning a gold medal at the 2008 Olympics remained her "ultimate goal."

[[File:Marion Jones 12.jpg|thumb|Jones running at the 2006 [[Meeting Gaz de France]] in Paris]]

May 2006 saw Jones run 11.06 at altitude but into a headwind in her season debut and beat [[Veronica Campbell]] and [[Lauryn Williams]] in subsequent 100m events. By July 8, 2006, Jones appeared to be in top form; she won the 100&nbsp;m sprint at [[Gaz de France]] with a time of 10.93&nbsp;seconds. It was her fastest time in almost four years. Three days later, Jones once more improved on her seasonal best time at the Rome IIAF Golden League (10.91&nbsp;seconds), but lost to [[Jamaica]]'s [[Sherone Simpson]], who clocked 10.87.

===WNBA===
In November 2009, it was reported that Jones was working out for the [[San Antonio Silver Stars]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]]. She had previously played basketball while in college at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], playing on the team that won a national championship in 1994. Her number 20 jersey had been honored by the school and hangs in [[Carmichael Auditorium]]. She had previously been selected in the 3rd round of the [[2003 WNBA Draft]] by the [[Phoenix Mercury]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nba.fanhouse.com/2009/11/30/marion-jones-attempting-comeback-as-pro-basketball-player/|title=Marion Jones Attempting Comeback as Pro Basketball Player|date=November 30, 2009|first=Kevin|last=Blackistone}}</ref> On March 10, 2010, the [[Tulsa Shock]] announced that Jones had signed to play with the team, making the professional minimum (about $35,000) in her first season.<ref name="TW20100310">{{cite news| title=Marion Jones signs with WNBA's Shock|date=March 10, 2010|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/wnba/news;_ylt=Asa57cBmhHNacgHrhuH_mM5bvrYF?slug=ap-shock-jones&prov=ap&type=lgns&print=1|accessdate=2010-03-10|first=Justin|last=Juozapavicius|agency=Associated Press|work=Yahoo!

==''Top Speed'' film==
Marion Jones was showcased in the 2003 film ''[[Top Speed (documentary film)|Top Speed]]'', which documents her talent and skill within sprinting. Directed by [[Greg MacGillivray]] and shot in [[IMAX]] format, it covers details from races to any mistakes she has made within her performances, Marion is profiled amongst other speed specialists like [[racing driver]] [[Lucas Luhr]], [[mountain bike]]r [[Marla Streb]], and [[Stephen Murkett]], one of the designers of the [[Porsche Cayenne]].

==Use of illicit performance enhancing drugs==
Throughout her entire athletic career&mdash;even in high school&mdash;Marion Jones had been accused, either outright or by implication, of taking performance enhancing drugs, a common allegation surrounding athletes involved in the sports under the "Track and Field" umbrella. Until 2007, Jones routinely denied&mdash;in almost every way possible and in almost any venue where the question arose&mdash;ever being involved with performance enhancers in any way, shape, or form. One of Jones's frequent statements in her own defense was that she had never tested positive for performance enhancing substances; in her autobiography, she blamed the 2002 breakup of her marriage to [[C.J. Hunter]] in part on the fact that Hunter ''had'' tested positive for steroids four times before the 2000 Olympics, tainting her own drug-free image. However, the rumors and accusations that started when Jones missed a random drug test in high school in the early 1990s (Jones claimed she never received the letter notifying her of the required test; attorney [[Johnnie Cochran]] successfully got the four-year ban from track and field competition, the penalty for missing a random drug test, overturned)<ref name=fastestwoman>{{cite journal|accessdate=2008-02-10|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/marionjones1.html|title=Marion Jones: Fastest Woman on Earth|last=Rowen|first=Beth|last2=Ross|first2=Shmuel|coauthors=Olson, Liz|year=2007|work=InfoPlease Database}}</ref> continued to follow her through two Olympiads and several championship meets. Soon, a pattern of Jones choosing to train with both coaches and athletes who were also being dogged by rumors and accusations of performance enhancement drugs began to emerge.

===The BALCO investigation===
On December 3, 2004, [[Victor Conte]], the founder of [[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative|BALCO]], appeared in an interview with [[Martin Bashir]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]''. In the interview, Conte told a national audience that he had personally given Jones five different illegal performance enhancing drugs before, during and after the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. In the course of investigative research, San Francisco based reporters [[Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada]] reported Jones had received banned drugs from BALCO, citing documentary evidence and testimony from Jones's ex-husband C.J. Hunter, who claims to have seen Jones inject herself in the stomach with the steroids.<ref name=Fainaru-Wada2006>{{cite book|last=Fainaru-Wada|first=M.|last2=Williams|first2=L.|title=Game of Shadows|publisher=Gotham Books|year=2006|pages=234<U+2013>235}}</ref>

According to Hunter's 2004 testimony before a federal grand jury, Jones' use of banned drugs began well before Sydney.<ref name=Williams20060819>{{cite news |accessdate=2008-08-04 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/08/19/MNGBGKLP8H1.DTL&hw=marion+jones&sn=003&sc=976 |title=Sprinter Jones failed drug test |author=Williams, Lance|date=August 19, 2006 |work=San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref> Hunter told the investigators that Jones first obtained [[Erythropoietin|EPO]] from Graham, who Hunter said had a [[Mexico|Mexican]] connection for the drug. Later, Hunter said, Graham met Conte, who began providing the coach with BALCO "nutritional supplements", which were actually an experimental class of "designer" steroids said to be undetectable by any drug screening procedures available at the time. Graham then distributed the performance enhancers to Jones and other Sprint Capitol athletes. Still later, Hunter told federal agents, Jones began receiving drugs directly from Conte.

Jones had never failed a drug test using the then-existing testing procedures, and insufficient evidence was found to bring charges regarding other untested performance enhancing drugs.

===2006 EPO tests===
''[[The Washington Post]]'', citing unidentified sources with knowledge of drug results from the [[USA Track and Field]] Championships in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana|IN]], reported that on June 23, 2006, an "A" sample of Marion Jones' urine tested positive for [[Erythropoietin]] (EPO), a banned performance-enhancer. Jones withdrew from the [[Weltklasse Z<U+00FC>rich|Weltklasse Golden League]] meet in [[Switzerland]], citing "personal reasons", and once more denied using performance-enhancing drugs. She retained lawyer [[Howard Jacobs]], who has represented many athletes in doping cases, including [[Tim Montgomery]] and cyclist [[Floyd Landis]]. On September 6, 2006, Jones' lawyers announced that her "B" sample had tested negative, which cleared her from the doping allegations.

===Admission of perjury during BALCO investigation===
On October 5, 2007, Jones admitted to lying to federal agents about her use of [[steroid]]s prior to the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] and pled guilty at the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]]).<ref name=NYT20071005/> She confessed to Judge Kenneth Karas that she had made false statements regarding the [[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative|BALCO]] case and a check-fraud case. She was released on her own [[recognizance]] but was required to surrender both her US and Belizean passports, pending sentencing in January. Although a maximum sentence of five years could be imposed, the prosecution recommended no more than six months as part of Jones' plea bargain.<ref name="NYT20071006">{{cite news|title=Jones Admits to Doping and Enters Guilty Plea|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=October 6, 2007|page=D1|first=Lynn|last=Zinser|first2=Michael S.|last2=Schmidt}}</ref>

After her legal admission of perjury, Jones held a press conference, where she finally publicly admitted taking [[steroids]] before the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics]] and acknowledged that she had, in fact, lied when she previously denied steroid use in statements to the press, to various sports agencies, and&mdash;most significantly&mdash;to two [[grand jury|grand juries]]. One was impaneled to investigate the [[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative]] (BALCO) "designer steroid" ring, and the other was impaneled to investigate a check fraud ring involving many of the same parties from the BALCO case. As a result of these admissions, Jones accepted a two-year suspension from track and field competition issued by the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]], and announced her retirement from track and field on October 5, 2007.<ref name=NYT20071005>{{cite news|accessdate=2007-10-05|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/05/sports/othersports/05cnd-balco.html?hp=&pagewanted=print|title=Jones Pleads Guilty to Lying About Drugs|first=Michael S.|last=Schmidt|first2=Lynn|last2=Zinser|date=October 5, 2007|work=New York Times}}</ref> She broke down in tears during the press conference as she tearfully apologized, saying "...with a great amount of shame...I stand before you and tell you that I have betrayed your trust...and you have the right to be angry with me... I have let my country down and I have let myself down."<ref name= "NYT20071006"/>

The US Anti-Doping Agency stated that their sanction "also requires disqualification of all her competitive results obtained after September 1, 2000, and forfeiture of all medals, results, points and prizes". On October 5, 2007, Jones formally pled guilty to lying to federal agents in the [[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative|BALCO]] steroid investigation in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|US District Court]]. On January 11, 2008, Jones was sentenced to 6 months in jail.<ref name = NYT20071005/> She began her sentence on March 7, 2008,<ref name=AFP20080307>{{cite news|accessdate=2008-07-30|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j45h2TXIPAcsLvMwWvwlDUeXuKVQ|title=Disgraced sprinter Jones reports to jail|date=March 7, 2008|work=AFP}}</ref> and was released on September 5, 2008.<ref name=Released/>

In the BALCO case, she had denied to federal agents her use of the steroid [[Tetrahydrogestrinone]], known as "The Clear", or "THG", from 1999, but claimed she was given the impression she was taking a [[flaxseed oil]] supplement for two years while coach Trevor Graham supplied her with the substance. In a published letter, Jones said she had used steroids until she stopped training with Graham at the end of 2002. She said she lied when federal agents questioned her in 2003 because she panicked when they presented her with a sample of "The Clear".<ref name=Shipley2007>{{cite news|last=Shipley|first=Amy|title=Marion Jones Admits to Steroid Use|work=The Washington Post|date=October 5, 2007|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/04/AR2007100401666_pf.html}}</ref>

===USOC demands return of Olympic medals===
[[Peter Ueberroth]], Chairman of the [[United States Olympic Committee|US Olympic Committee]], reacted to the news of Jones' confession and guilty plea on perjury charges by issuing a statement calling on Jones to "immediately step forward and return the Olympic medals she won while competing in violation of the rules". Ueberroth added that her admission "is long overdue and underscores the shame and dishonor that are inherent with cheating." [[IAAF]] president [[Lamine Diack]] said in a statement that, "Marion Jones will be remembered as one of the biggest frauds in sporting history."<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=IAAF decries Jones' tainted legacy|date=October 8, 2007}}</ref>

On October 8, 2007, a source confirmed that Marion Jones surrendered her five medals from the [[2000 Summer Olympics]].<ref name="JonesReturnsMedals" /> On the same day, Peter Ueberroth said that all the relay medals should be returned,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/13/sports/othersports/13jones.html?_r=1&ref=othersports&pagewanted=print|title=Jones's Teammate Braces for Worst|author=Associated Press|date=October 13, 2007|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref> and on April 10, 2008, the IOC voted to strip Jones' relay teammates of their medals, as well,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/trackandfield/news/story?id=3339267|title=IOC votes to strip Jones' teammates of medals from 2000 Games|author=Associated Press|date=April 10, 2008|publisher=ESPN}}</ref> though this decision would successfully be appealed by seven of Jones' teammates and overturned in 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=oly&id=5385884|title=US relay runners win Olympic medals appeal|author=Associated Press|date=April 10, 2008|publisher=ESPN}}</ref> Jones was ordered by the US Anti-Doping Agency to forfeit all awards and medals received after September 1, 2000. The IOC has yet to determine what will be done with the forfeited medals {{as of|2008|4|10|lc=on|df=US}}, pending the conclusion of the BALCO investigation.

===Formal IOC disqualification===
On December 12, 2007, the [[International Olympic Committee]] formally stripped Jones of all five Olympic medals dating back to September 2000, and banned her from attending the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in any capacity.<ref name="IOC Strips">{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/22170098/|title=IOC strips Jones of all 5 Olympic medals|date=December 12, 2007|author=Associated Press|work=MSNBC.com}}</ref> The IOC action also officially disqualified Jones from her fifth place finish in the Long Jump at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].<ref name="IOC Strips"/>

On October 28, 2008, Marion Jones was interviewed by [[Oprah Winfrey]] and stated that she would have won gold at the Sydney Olympics without the drugs that led to her disgrace.<ref>{{YouTube|id=3ewja4q0z7s|title=Oprah Interviews Marion Jones}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Daily Telegraph staff|title=Marion Jones tells Oprah Winfrey: I'd have won without the drugs|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=October 30, 2008}}</ref>

===Criminal sentencing, perjury case===
On January 11, 2008, US District Judge Kenneth Karas sentenced Jones to six months in prison and 200 hours of community service for [[perjury]] relating to her using of steroids and for a check-fraud scam. She was also sentenced to two years probation following her prison term.<ref name=Sentenced/> Jones reported to the Federal Medical Center-Carswell prison facility in Fort Worth, Texas, on March 7, 2008, and was assigned [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] Register no. 84868-054.<ref name=AFP20080307/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=IDSearch&needingMoreList=false&IDType=IRN&IDNumber=84868-054&x=4&y=12|title=Marion Jones (84868-054)|work=[[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]|accessdate=January 9, 2010}}</ref> She was released from prison on September 5, 2008.<ref name="Released">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=3570875&type=story|title=Marion Jones released from Texas federal prison|date=September 5, 2008|author=Associated Press|work=ESPN.com}}</ref>

==Check-counterfeiting scandal==
In conjunction with the performance enhancing drugs probe, Marion Jones was also under investigation for her involvement in a check-counterfeiting scheme that had already been linked to her former coach, Steve Riddick, her sports agent Charles Wells, and her ex-boyfriend, Tim Montgomery.

===Financial troubles===
Seven years after winning a women's record five Olympic track and field medals and receiving multi-million dollar endorsement deals, Marion Jones was broke.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://cbs.sportsline.com/worldsports/story/10236098|title=Former Olympian, track millionaire Jones now broke|publisher=CBS Sports}}</ref> According to the Associated Press, Jones is heavily in debt and fighting off court judgments, according to court records reviewed by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. In 2006, a bank foreclosed on her $2.5-million mansion near [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], where [[Michael Jordan]] was a neighbor. She was also forced to sell two other properties, including her mother's house, to raise money. In her prime, Jones was one of track's first female sports millionaires, typically earning between $70,000 and $80,000 a race, plus at least another $1 million from race bonuses and endorsement deals.

===Alleged involvement in check fraud===
In July 2006, Jones was linked to a [[check fraud|check-counterfeiting scheme]] that led to criminal charges against her coach and ex-boyfriend Montgomery.<ref name=BankRecords/> Documents showed that a $25,000 check made out to Jones was deposited in her bank account as part of the alleged multimillion-dollar scheme. Prosecutors allege that funds were sent to Jones' track coach, [[Steve Riddick]], in [[Virginia]], then funneled back to New York through a network of "friends, relatives and associates."<ref name=BankRecords>{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/13848653/|title=Bank records link Marion Jones to money scam|date=July 16, 2006|author=Associated Press|work=NBC Sports}}</ref> Riddick was arrested in February on [[money-laundering]] charges. According to the indictment and subsequent documents filed with the court, the link to Jones was made through one of Riddick's business partners, Nathaniel Alexander.

===Admission of perjury during check fraud investigation===
On October 5, 2007, Jones pled guilty to making false statements to IRS Special Agent [[Jeff Novitzky]] leading the ongoing BALCO investigation in California. Jones claimed she had never taken performance-enhancing drugs. "That was a lie, your honor," she said from the defense table. The federal government, through grand juries, had been investigating steroid abuse since 2003.

Jones also pled guilty to making false statements about her knowledge of a check-cashing scheme to New York US Department of Homeland Security Special Agent Erik Rosenblatt, who has been leading a broad financial investigation that has already convicted the father of Jones's child, former world record holder and "World's Fastest Man" [[Tim Montgomery]], sports agent [[Charles Wells]], and her coach, 1976 Olympic gold medalist [[Steve Riddick]].

===Criminal sentencing, check fraud case===
[[File:CarswellFMCFortWorthTX.jpg|thumb|[[Federal Medical Center, Carswell]], where Jones was incarcerated]]
On January 11, 2008, Marion Jones was sentenced to six months in prison for perjury, concerning her involvement in the check fraud case and her use of performance-enhancing drugs. She was ordered to surrender on March 11 to begin her jail term. Jones reported to the [[Federal Medical Center, Carswell]] prison facility in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] on March 7 and was assigned [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] register no. 84868-054.<ref name=AFP20080307/> She was released from prison on September 5.<ref name="Released" />

In legal filings prior to sentencing, lawyers for the defense requested US District Judge [[Kenneth Karas]] limit her penalty to probation and community service. Part of their argument was that Ms. Jones had been punished enough by apologizing publicly, retiring from track and field, and relinquishing her five Olympic medals. Lawyers for the prosecution had suggested any sentence between probation and six months would be fair (with the maximum penalty being five years in prison). Judge Karas sought advice as to whether he could go beyond the six-month sentence suggested by the prosecution.

During the sentencing hearing, Judge Karas admonished Jones in the courtroom, stating that she knew what she was doing and would be punished accordingly.<ref name=Sentenced>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7182969.stm|title=Six-month jail sentence for Jones|publisher=BBC News| accessdate=2008-01-11|date=January 11, 2008}}</ref> "The offences here are serious. They each involve lies made three years apart," said Judge Karas, also adding that Jones' actions were "not a one-off mistake... but a repetition in an attempt to break the law."<ref name=Sentenced/>
