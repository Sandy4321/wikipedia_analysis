The '''SpaceX reusable launch system development program''' is a [[private spaceflight|privately funded]] program to develop of a set of new technologies for an [[Orbital spaceflight|orbital]] launch system that may be [[reusable launch vehicle|reused]] many times in a manner similar to the reusability of [[aircraft]].  The company [[SpaceX]] is developing the technologies over a number of years to facilitate full and rapid reusability of space [[launch vehicle]]s. The project's long-term objectives include returning a launch vehicle [[multistage rocket|first stage]] to the launch site in minutes and to return a second stage back to the launch pad following orbital realignment with the launch site and [[atmospheric entry|atmospheric reentry]] in up to 24 hours. Both stages are designed to be available for reuse a few hours after return.<ref name="pm20120207">{{cite news |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/rockets/elon-musk-on-spacexs-reusable-rocket-plans-6653023 |title=Elon Musk on SpaceX's Reusable Rocket Plans |work=Popular Mechanics |last=Simberg |first=Rand |date=February 8, 2012 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}</ref>

The program was publicly announced in 2011 and the design for returning the rocket to its launchpad using only thrusters was completed in February 2012.<ref name="pm20120207" /> SpaceX's active test program began in late 2012 with testing low-altitude, low-speed aspects of the [[VTVL|landing]] technology.  High-velocity, high-altitude aspects of the booster atmospheric return technology began testing in late 2013.

The reusable launch system technology is under development for the [[Falcon (rocket family)|Falcon family]] of rockets. It is particularly well-suited to the [[Falcon Heavy]] where the two [[Modular rocket|outer cores]] separate from the rocket earlier in the flight, and are therefore moving more slowly at stage separation. If the technology is used on a reusable [[Falcon 9]] rocket, the first stage separation would occur at a velocity of approximately {{nowrap|2.0 km/s}} {{nowrap|(6,500 km/h; 4,100 mph; Mach 6)}} rather than the {{nowrap|3.4 km/s}} {{nowrap|(11,000 km/h; 7,000 mph; Mach 10)}} for an expendable Falcon 9, to provide the residual fuel necessary for the deceleration and turnaround maneuver and the controlled descent and landing.<ref name="pm20120207" />

The broad outline of the reusable launch system was first publicly described on September 29, 2011.  SpaceX said it would attempt to develop powered descent and recovery of both Falcon 9 stages{{mdash}}a fully vertical takeoff, vertical landing ([[VTVL]]) rocket.  The company produced a [[Computer animation|computer-animated video]] depicting a notional view of the first stage returning tail-first for a powered descent and the second stage with a heat shield, reentering head first before rotating for a powered descent.<ref name="wp20110929">{{cite news |title=SpaceX chief details reusable rocket |work=Washington Post |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=December 30, 2012 |quote=''Both of the rocket's stages would return to the launch site and touch down vertically, under rocket power, on landing gear after delivering a spacecraft to orbit.

== Technologies ==
Several new technologies need to be developed and tested to facilitate successful launch and recovery of both [[rocket stage|stages]] of the SpaceX reusable rocket launching system, including:

== Economic issues ==
In order to make the Falcon 9 reusable and return to the launch site, extra [[rocket propellant|propellant]] and [[landing gear]] must be carried on the first stage, requiring around a 30 percent reduction of the maximum payload to orbit in comparison with the expendable Falcon 9.<ref name="bbc20130930" /> Reflight of a previously-used stage on a subsequent flight is dependent on the condition of the landed stage, and upon introducing space launch customers to the very novel idea of putting a payload in space with a ''[[Used good|used]]'' stage. In September 2013, SpaceX said that if all aspects of the test program are successful and if a customer is interested, the first reflight of a Falcon 9 booster stage could happen as early as late 2014.<ref name="bbc20130930" />

If SpaceX is successful in developing the reusable technology, it is expected to significantly reduce the cost of access to space, and change the increasingly competitive market in space launch services.<ref name="bbc20130930">{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24331860 |title=Recycled rockets: SpaceX calls time on expendable launch vehicles |work=BBC News |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |date=September 30, 2013 |accessdate=October 2, 2013}}</ref>
Michael Belfiore wrote in [[Foreign Policy]] that at a published cost of {{USD|56.5 million}} per launch to [[low Earth orbit]], "Falcon 9 rockets are already the cheapest in the industry.

However, even if SpaceX is successful with the technology, they could lose profits due to reduced [[Demand (economics)|demand]] for their rockets as fewer new launch vehicles are ordered from their factory.  Additional demand to make up for this loss would need to come from new markets, and it is uncertain whether such demand would emerge.<ref name=mtr20140313>

== Technical feasibility ==
The return and rapid reuse of an orbital launch system has never been accomplished.  In fact, the physics of the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]] that describes the forces and physical movement of rockets nearly precludes it.<ref>{{cite web|title=Methods and apparatus for reusable launch platform and reusable spacecraft|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US5667167|publisher=USPTO|accessdate=2014-03-18}}</ref>  The challenge of creating a reusable rocket is almost impossible due to the small percentage of a rocket's mass that can make it to orbit.<ref name="sdc20110930"/> Typically, a rocket's payload is only about 3% of the mass of the rocket which is also roughly the amount of mass in fuel that is required for the vehicle's re-entry.<ref name="youtube20110929">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrVD3tcVWTY |title=National Press Club: The Future of Human Spaceflight |date=September 29, 2011}}</ref> 

Elon Musk said that he believes return, vertical landing and recovery is possible because the SpaceX manufacturing methodologies result in a rocket efficiency exceeding the typical 3% margin. A SpaceX rocket operating in the reusable configuration will have approximately 30% less payload lift capacity than the same rocket in an [[expendable rocket|expendable]] configuration.<ref name=pm20130930/>

Grasshopper is a set of experimental technology-demonstrator, [[suborbital]] [[Reusable launch system|reusable launch vehicles]] (RLV).  Two vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL) rockets are being built. The first, Grasshopper v1.0, was built in 2011-2012 for low-altitude, low-velocity hover testing in Texas that began in September 2012 and concluded in October 2013 after eight test flights. The second, Grasshopper v1.1, was built in 2013 for higher-altitude and higher-velocity flight testing in New Mexico.<ref name="nbf20130323" /><ref name="msnbc20110927">{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/44692930/ |title=A rocket that lifts off<U+2014>and lands<U+2014>on launch pad |work=NBC News |last=Klotz |first=Irene |date=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=November 23, 2011 }}</ref><ref name="nsw20121002" /><ref name="sfn20120924" />

=== Falcon 9 booster post-mission, controlled-descent tests ===
[[File:Launch of Falcon 9 carrying CASSIOPE (130929-F-IN231-103).jpg|[[Falcon 9 Flight 6|Falcon 9 v.1.1]] vehicle during launch ascent on September 29, 2013, three minutes before the first-ever retro-deceleration and descent flight test of the first-stage booster.|right|thumb]]

In an arrangement unusual for launch vehicles, some first stages of the SpaceX Falcon 9 v1.1 rockets are being used for propulsive-return controlled-descent flight tests after they complete the boost phase of an orbital flight.  These boosters would ordinarily just be discarded in the ocean once boost phase is complete.  The over-water tests will occur in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans south of [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] and east of [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]].  The first flight test occurred on September 29, 2013, after the second stage with the [[CASSIOPE]] and [[nanosat]] payloads separated from the booster. These descent and simulated landing tests are continuing in 2014, with the second flight scheduled for no earlier than March.<ref name="bbc20130930" /><ref name=dn20140224/>

Following analysis of the flight test data from the first booster-controlled descent in September 2013, SpaceX announced it had successfully tested a large amount of new technology on the flight, and that coupled with the technology advancements made on the Grasshopper low-altitude landing demonstrator, it believed is was ready to test a full recovery of the booster stage. The first flight test was successful; SpaceX said it was "able to successfully transition from vacuum through [[hypersonic]], through [[supersonic]], through [[transonic]], and light the engines all the way and control the stage all the way through [the atmosphere]".<ref name=pm20130930>{{cite news |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/rockets/musk-spacex-now-has-all-the-pieces-for-reusable-rockets-15985616 |title=Musk: SpaceX Now Has "All the Pieces" For Truly Reusable Rockets |work=Popular Mechanics |last=Belfiore |first=Michael |date=September 30, 2013 |accessdate=October 17, 2013 }}</ref> Musk said, "the next attempt to recovery [sic] the Falcon 9 first stage will be on the fourth flight of the upgraded rocket.

In the event, SpaceX announced in February 2014 that while they would test the [[Launch vehicle landing gear|landing legs]] on the second test flight, they would continue with the plan to descend over the ocean and attempt a simulated landing over the water, following the ignition of the second stage on the [[SpaceX CRS-3|third cargo resupply mission]] contracted to NASA.

==== Reusability test plan for post-mission testing ====
The post-mission Falcon 9 test plan for these flights calls for the first stage booster to do a retro-propulsion burn in the upper atmosphere to slow it down and put it on a descent ballistic trajectory to its target landing location, followed by a second burn in the lower atmosphere before the booster reaches the water.<ref name="pa20130910" /> SpaceX said in March 2013 that it intended to conduct such tests on every Falcon 9 v1.1 launch vehicle and would "continue doing such tests until they can do a return to the launch site and a powered landing". The company said it expected several failures before it can land the vehicle correctly.<ref name="nsw20130328">{{cite news |url=http://www.newspacewatch.com/articles/spacex-moving-quickly-towards-fly-back-first-stage.html |title=SpaceX moving quickly towards fly-back first stage |work=NewSpace Watch |last=Lindsey |first=Clark |date=March 28, 2013 |accessdate=March 29, 2013 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/3Yojk |archivedate=April 11, 2013 |subscription=yes }}</ref><ref name=dn20140224/> In September 2013, SpaceX announced a slight modification to this plan; the [[Falcon 9 Flight 7|second]] and [[Falcon 9 Flight 8|third]] flights of the Falcon 9 v1.1 rocket will not conduct booster-controlled descent tests, and that the [[Falcon 9 Flight 9|fourth]] v1.1 flight would be the second test of the booster controlled descent test profile.<ref name="bbc20130930" />

==== Test flight history ====
;Test flight 1

After the three-minute boost phase of September 29 launch{{mdash}}the first flight of the v1.1 version of the Falcon 9{{mdash}}the first stage was [[Attitude control|reoriented]], and three of the nine Merlin 1D engines reignited at high altitude to initiate a deceleration and controlled descent trajectory to the surface of the ocean. The first phase of the test "worked well and the first stage re-entered safely".<ref name="pa20130930" /> However, the stage began to roll because of aerodynamic forces during the descent through the atmosphere, and the roll rate exceeded the capabilities of the booster [[attitude control system]] (ACS) to [[Null (physics)|null]] it out. The fuel in the tanks "centrifuged" to the outside of the tank and the single engine involved in the low-altitude deceleration maneuver shut down.  SpaceX was able to retrieve some first stage debris from the ocean.<ref name="bbc20130930" /><ref name="pa20130930" /> The company did not expect a successful booster recovery on this flight<ref name=sdc20131017/> and, {{asof|2013|03|lc=y}}, had said that they did not expect booster recovery following the first several powered-descent tests.<ref name="pa20130328" /> The test was successful{{mdash}}with substantial test milestones achieved and a great deal of engineering test data collected{{mdash}}but the booster was not successfully recovered from the ocean.<ref name=sdc20131017>{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/23230-spacex-falcon9-reusable-rocket-milestone.html |title=SpaceX Hit Huge Reusable Rocket Milestone with Falcon 9 Test |work=Space.com |last=Wall |first=Mike |date=October 17, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref>
