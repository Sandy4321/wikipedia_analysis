== Plot ==

The episode's five flashbacks focus on the reactions and activities of the ''Kahana'' crew after Oceanic&nbsp;815 is discovered. [[Daniel Faraday]] ([[Jeremy Davies (actor)|Jeremy Davies]]) is shown crying while watching the news, although he is not sure why.  Miles is a [[mediumship|medium]] who is hired by an elderly woman to remove the ghost of her grandson from her home.  After conversing with the spirit, Miles finds a hidden cache of money and drugs.  Charlotte is an anthropologist who finds a polar bear skeleton bearing a [[Dharma Initiative]] collar buried in the Tunisian desert.  Frank, an alcoholic who is originally scheduled to fly 815, phones the Oceanic hotline, and claims that the wreckage of the plane is not authentic.  Finally, [[Naomi Dorrit]] ([[Marsha Thomason]]) is shown in a posthumous flashback, criticizing her employer [[Characters of Lost#Off-island characters|Matthew Abaddon]] ([[Lance Reddick]]) for his choice in her co-workers.<ref name=episode>[[Drew Goddard|Goddard, Drew]] (writer) & [[Brian K.

Daniel's third colleague, Frank, fires a flare into the sky, leading Jack's group to him.  Frank tells Jack's group that he managed to land the helicopter intact.  After finding out that [[Juliet Burke]] ([[Elizabeth Mitchell]]) is one of the [[Others (Lost)|Others]], Miles demands to know where Ben is, as locating him is the freighter crew's primary objective.<ref name=episode/>

Jeff Jensen of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' thought that "Confirmed Dead" "was downright alive with fascinating new characters, mind-blowing new possibilities, and exciting new theory fodder"; however, he had heard complaints from others who received the preview screeners that they found the episode to be flawed.  They considered the scene where 815 is found to be cheating because Daniel only experiences it by watching it on television, Frank's safe landing of the helicopter to be a mystery, Naomi's flashback to be cheating ''Lost'' rules because she is dead and Ben's manipulation of Locke to be an overused storyline.<ref>Jensen, Jeff "Doc", ([[February 7]], [[2008]]) "[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20177008,00.html Chute First, Ask Questions Later]", ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.
