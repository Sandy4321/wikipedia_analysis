==Family==
He is married to Marian Vallely and their son Private First Class Scott Paul Vallely died on [[April 20]], [[2004]] while in his fourth week of [[Special Forces Qualification Course]] Special Forces training.<ref>http://www.soldiersmemorialfund.org/soldiers-memorial-fund-biography.html</ref><ref>http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=46832</ref>

==Education==
He graduated from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] and was commissioned into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in 1961.  He graduated from Infantry School, Ranger and Airborne Schools, Jumpmaster School, the Command and General Staff School, The Industrial College of the Armed Forces and the Army War College. His combat service in [[South Vietnam]] included positions as infantry company commander, intelligence officer, operations officer, military advisor and aide-de-camp. He retired in 1993, at the rank of [[Major General (United States)|Major General]], from his position as Deputy Commanding General, Pacific.

==Center for Security Policy==
Vallely serves as the Military Committee Chairman for the [[Center for Security Policy]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and occasionally writes columns and lectures on the [[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]].  Some of his public statements have caused controversy, such as saying "we are not going to permit" a Shiite victory in an Iraqi election, and claiming that the war on terror is a war between [[Islam]] and [[Judeo-Christianity]]: "That's what's going on. If you don't understand that, then you don't get it."{{ref|val1}}

==Tour of Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp==
Vallely toured the [[Camp Delta]] detention camp at [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]], [[Cuba]] in 2006 while collecting material for a book titled ''The Myths of Gitmo: Torture, Abuse or the Truth'' with co-author LTC [[Gordon Cucullu]]. Vallely and Cucullu later participated in an interview with ''[[FrontPage Magazine]]'' in which he blasted allegations of [[detainee abuse]] as "myths of the [[left-wing]] press". He also voiced support for the [[force feeding]] of detainees attempting to undertake [[hunger strike]]s, claiming the detainees were "...simply restrained for 20 minutes so they can be fed [[Ensure]]. They get their choice of four flavors of Ensure. It<U+2019>s put in a very unobtrusive feeding tube smaller than a normal straw and it<U+2019>s put in there for 20 minutes, so they get breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They get to go back to their detention facility."<ref name="frontpagemag.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Read.aspx?GUID={49DE2543-29F8-4F6F-8372-85DF58E38ADD} |title=A View from Inside Gitmo |date=May 5, 2006 |publisher=[[FrontPage Magazine]] |accessdate = 2007-09-16}}</ref>

Force feeding of non-[[psychosis|psychotic]] prisoners has been banned by the [[World Medical Association]] since 1975, listing it alongside [[torture]] as a form of "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment".<ref>[http://www.wma.net/e/policy/c18.htm WMA - Policy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
Vallely later admitted in the same interview that neither he nor Cucullu had actually spoken with any of the detainees to corroborate official reports of their treatment.<ref name="frontpagemag.com"/>

When prompted further as to details of abuse, Cucullu stated that at least one prisoner "...may have been roughed up a little bit", but immediately clarified "We<U+2019>re not trying to do an exhaustive history of Gitmo in this thing."<ref name="frontpagemag.com"/>

==Jerusalem Summit organization==
Vallely is also a supporter of the [[Jerusalem]] Summit [http://www.jerusalemsummit.org/eng/ organization]
and an advocate of the organization's [http://www.jerusalemsummit.org/eng/hs_short_eng.htm proposal] to "relocate"/"resettle" [[Palestine]] and the [[Palestinian people]] to surrounding [[Arab]] countries as a solution to the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], and to bring about the organization's belief "that one of the objectives of Israel's divinely-inspired rebirth is to make it the center of the new unity of the nations, which will lead to an era of peace and prosperity, foretold by the Prophets."

==The Plame Affair==
Vallely interjected himself into the [[Plame Affair|Plame leak]] after two and a half years. He told the ''[[World Net Daily]]'' on [[November 5]], [[2005]] that 
<blockquote>
Maj. Gen. Paul Vallely told WorldNetDaily that [[Joseph C. Wilson]] mentioned Plame's status as a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] employee over the course of at least three, possibly five, conversations in 2002 in the Fox News Channel's "green room" in Washington, D.C., as they waited to appear on air as analysts.

Vallely says, according to his recollection, 'Wilson mentioned his wife's job in the spring of 2002' -- more than a year before [[Robert Novak]]'s [[July 14]], [[2003]], column identified her, citing senior administration officials, as "an Agency operative on [[weapons of mass destruction]]."{{ref|medval}}</blockquote>

Over that weekend Vallely supposedly recalled other times Wilson allegedly shared classified information on his wife's CIA status. As noted above Vallely said he was told once in Spring 2002, but the WND on [[November 9]], [[2005]] reported:

<blockquote>
After recalling further over the weekend his contacts with Wilson, Vallely says now it was on just one occasion <U+2013> the first of several conversations <U+2013> that the ambassador revealed his wife's employment with the CIA and that it likely occurred some time in the late summer or early fall of 2002.{{ref|weekend}}</blockquote>

<blockquote>
On Saturday, WorldNetDaily published a story based on an interview with Maj. General Paul Vallely, a distinguished career military man and Fox News analyst, who said Ambassador Joseph Wilson, the man at the center of the CIA leak case, had told him in casual conversations in the Fox News studios that his wife, Valerie Plame, was a CIA employee - more than a year before this was first disclosed publicly in a column written by journalist Robert Novak.{{ref|Vallie}}</blockquote>

This was a serious charge to make, especially since, at the time, there were five felony counts leveled against [[Lewis Libby]], then Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]'s Chief of Staff. Yet, there is currently no evidence that Wilson made such statements. Joseph Wilson has currently pursued legal action against ''World Net Daily'' and Vallely.{{ref|legalaction}}

==Works==
Together with Lt. Gen. [[Thomas McInerney]], Vallely co-authored a book published in 2004, entitled ''[[Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror]]''.

Vallely also co-authored a 1980 paper with then PSYOP analyst [[Michael Aquino]] entitled ''From PSYOP to MindWar: The Psychology of Victory.'' MindWar is defined as "the deliberate aggressive convincing of all participants in a war that we will win that war."  The paper contrasts a use of psychological operations such as propaganda with a new approach.  The paper contains this passage:

:Unlike PSYOP, MindWar has nothing to do with deception or even with "selected" - and therefore misleading - truth.  Rather it states a '''whole''' truth that, if it does not now exist, will be forced into existence by the will of the United States.  The examples of [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]]'s ultimatum to [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and [[Hitler]]'s stance at [[Munich]] might be cited. A MindWar message does not have to fit conditions of abstract credibility as do PSYOP there; its source makes it credible.  As Livy once said:
::''The terror of the Roman name will be such that the world shall know that, once a Roman army has laid siege to a city, '''nothing''' will move it - not the rigors of winter nor the weariness of the months and years - that it knows no end but victory and is ready, if a swift and sudden stroke will not serve, to preserve until that victory is achieved.''

:Unlike Ellul's cynical propagandist, the MindWar operative must '''know''' that he speaks the truth, and he must be '''personally committed''' to it.  What he says is only a part of MindWar; the rest - and the test of its effectiveness - lies in the conviction he projects to his audience, in the rapport he establishes with it.{{ref|mind}}  In practice, however, the difference between MindWar and cynical or deceptive propaganda, from the perspective of the audience, is difficult if not impossible to perceive.

==Work for the Pentagon==
In 2008, it was revealed that he had been one of a dozen "military analysts" recruited by the [[U.S. Department of Defense|Pentagon]] to spread favorable views of the [[Iraq war]] throughout the news media. <ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQP7ASBdwdo&feature=related</ref>
