{{Politics of Singapore}}
The '''2006 Singapore parliamentary general election''' was held on 6 May 2006. 1.22 million out of the 2.16 million eligible Singaporeans voted for [[Members of Parliament]] and elected their next government.<ref> {{cite news | title =  Singapore calls general election for May 6 | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 20 April 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/204032/1/.html}}</ref> The [[People's Action Party]] (PAP), in its first election under [[Lee Hsien Loong]], won 66.6% of the overall votes and gained 82 out of 84 seats.

The [[Parliament of Singapore|parliament]] was dissolved by [[President of Singapore|President]] [[Sellapan Ramanathan|S R Nathan]] on 20 April, three weeks before the election. On Nomination Day, the PAP gained 37 seats in divisions which were uncontested by other parties.<ref name="nominationbbc"> {{cite news | title = Singapore rulers face poll fight | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 27 April 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4949950.stm}}</ref> The main election issues included employment, cost of living, housing, transport, education, the need for an effective opposition voice in parliament, and the quality of the candidates.

==Background==
The 2006 General Election was the 15th General Election in Singapore and the 10th since independence. The governing [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) sought to secure their twelfth consecutive term in office since 1959. This would be the first election since [[Lee Hsien Loong]] became its Secretary-General. 

===Political parties===
Besides the ruling PAP, the other major political parties were the [[Workers' Party of Singapore]] (WP) led by [[Low Thia Khiang]], the [[Singapore People's Party]] (SPP) led by [[Chiam See Tong]], the [[National Solidarity Party]] (NSP) led by [[Steve Chia Kiah Hong]], and the [[Singapore Democratic Party]] (SDP) led by [[Chee Soon Juan]], who himself was ineligible to run in this election because of a 2002 conviction.<ref> {{cite news| title =  SDP's Chee Soon Juan declared bankrupt, cannot stand for elections till 2011  | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 10 February 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/192561/1/.html }} By Farah Abdul Rahim.</ref>

Four parties, including the SPP and the NSP, contested the election as members of the [[Singapore Democratic Alliance]] (SDA).

===Election deposit===
For this election, the deposit for each candidate was set at S$13,500 (approximately US$8590 or <U+00A3>4620) which was about 8% of the total annual salary to a Member of Parliament in the preceding year, rounded to the nearest S$500. The regulations of the elections stated that the deposit was to be forfeited if the candidate failed to obtain at least one-eighth of the votes.<ref name="cna_1mar06"> {{ cite news

===Electorate===
All citizens above 21 years of age, based on the [[electoral register|Registers of Electors]], were eligible to vote. The Elections Department had completed its revision of the Registers and made them available for public inspection from 17 January through 30 January 2006.<ref name="registers"> {{cite news | title =  Elections Dept completes revision of registers of electors | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 16 January 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/188481/1/.html }}</ref>   There were 2,158,439 eligible voters.<ref name="ed_17feb06"> [http://www.elections.gov.sg/pressrelease/20060217.pdf Press Release: Certification of Registers of Electors, 2006 (PDF)] - Election Department, February 17, 2006.</ref> The 2006 elections was the first election where more than half the electorate were of the post-independence generation, i.e., those born after [[History of the Republic of Singapore|Singapore's independence]] in 1965.

For the first time in Singapore's election history, Singaporeans living overseas were able to vote at designated polling stations located within Singapore's High Commissions, Embassies or Consulates in other countries.<ref> [http://www.elections.gov.sg/overseasvoting.htm Voting Overseas] Elections Department Singapore (Last updated on 7 September 2005)</ref> To be qualified to vote in overseas, they must have had either resided in Singapore for an aggregate of two of the past five years, or be overseas for reasons of employment or [[education]] related to the [[Government of Singapore|Singapore government]].<ref>[http://www.elections.gov.sg/overseasreg_faqs.htm#5] Elections Department Singapore</ref> There were several overseas polling stations, namely Tokyo, Canberra, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, London, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. 1,017 Singaporeans overseas had registered for overseas voting by 22 March 2006, although only 558 voted as the rest had a walkover in their constituencies.<ref name="ed_17feb06"/>

===Electoral divisions===
{{main|List of Singaporean electoral divisions|constituencies of Singapore}}

On 3 March 2006, the [[Electoral Boundaries Review Committee]] published the updated list of electoral divisions. There were fourteen [[Group Representation Constituency|Group Representation Constituencies]], each with five or six seats, and nine [[Single Member Constituency|Single Member Constituencies]]. The total number of seats remained the same at 84 as the previous [[Singapore general election, 2001|general election in 2001]]. The two opposition held SMCs i.e. [[Hougang SMC]] and [[Potong Pasir SMC]] were intact. Also unchanged was the [[Chua Chu Kang SMC]] which saw a close contest in the previous election between the ruling PAP's [[Low Seow Chay]] and NSP's [[Steve Chia]] who later became a [[Non-Constituency Member of Parliament]] until 2006.{{citation needed|February 2010}}

Two new Single Member Constituencies ([[Bukit Panjang SMC]] and [[Yio Chu Kang SMC]]) were created and two ([[Ayer Rajah SMC]] and [[Bukit Timah SMC]]) were absorbed into Group Representation Constituencies. [[East Coast Group Representation Constituency]] was reduced to five seats and [[Pasir Ris-Punggol Group Representation Constituency]] was increased to six.<ref> {{cite news | title =  Singapore unveils electoral map in hint polls could be near | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 3 March 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/196059/1/.html}}

Parts of [[Bedok New Town]], [[Bedok North Green]], [[Chai Chee Gardens]] and [[Kampong Chai Chee]] were transferred from East Coast to Marine Parade GRC. An area bounded by the [[Pan Island Expressway]], [[Jalan Eunos]] and [[Sims Avenue East]] were transferred from Aljunied to Marine Parade GRC. In return, the [[Serangoon]] division was transferred to Aljunied GRC.<ref> {{cite news | title = The numbers game | publisher = Today (Singapore newspaper) | date = 4 March 2006 | url = http://www.todayonline.com/articles/104599.asp }}</ref> In other changes, a part of [[Yishun]] from [[Sembawang GRC]] was transferred to [[Nee Soon East SMC]], and a section of [[Holland-Bukit Panjang GRC]] (now [[Holland-Bukit Timah GRC]]) was transferred to [[Tanjong Pagar GRC]].

{{main|Pre-election day events of the Singapore general election, 2006#Pre-nomination day events}}
===Dissolution of Parliament===
On 20 April 2006, Parliament was dissolved by [[President of Singapore|President]] [[Sellapan Ramanathan]] on the advice of [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] [[Lee Hsien Loong]].<ref> {{cite news | title = Singapore Parliament dissolved, paving way for general election | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 20 April 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/204025/1/.html }}</ref> Later that day, the President issued the [[writ of election|Writ of Election]] and the government announced that the election would be held on Saturday, 6 May 2006, with nomination day on Thursday, 27 April 2006. The [[Returning Officer]] was to be [[Tan Boon Huat]], Chief Executive Director of the [[People's Association]].<ref> {{cite news| url =  http://www.elections.gov.sg/pressrelease/20060420b.pdf | title = General Election 2006 | date = 20 April 2006 | publisher = Government of Singapore |format=PDF}}</ref>

===New candidates===
This election saw a large number of new candidates as the major political parties had undergone self-renewal in recent years.{{citation needed|February 2010}} Many of the new candidates belong to the post-1965 generation.{{citation needed|February 2010}} PAP introduced 24 new candidates, including 7 women. The opposition Workers' Party and the Singapore Democratic Alliance also introduced many first-timers for this election including three women from the Workers' Party.

===Budget day and progress package===
On 17 February 2006, [[Lee Hsien Loong]], Prime Minister of Singapore and Secretary General of the PAP delivered the country's Budget Statement to the Parliament. He released details of a S$2.6 billion on a "progress package" including S$500 million for [[Central Provident Fund]] top-ups, S$400 million for [[workfare]] bonuses, and S$200 million bonuses for [[National service in Singapore|national servicemen]]. Largely due to this package, the 2006 Budget incurred a deficit of S$2.86 billion.<ref> {{cite news | title = Singapore Boosts Welfare Spending, Offers Tax Breaks | publisher = Bloomberg | date = 17 February 2006 | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000080&sid=asT6laF3TxH8&refer=asia }}</ref><ref name="cna_24feb06_budget"> {{cite news | title =  Budget debate starts in Parliament on Monday  | publisher =Channel NewsAsia | date = 24 February 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/194811/1/.html }}</ref>

[[Low Thia Khiang]] (WP) came out strongly against the progress package which he said was no more than a vote-winning tool for the PAP. Low called for greater transparency on how the government intend to finance the package and to compensate for the budget shortfall. [[Wong Kan Seng]] (PAP) later dismissed claims that the ''progress package'' constitutes a form of vote buying.<ref> {{cite news| date = 7 April 2006 | title = PAP dismisses claims that Progress Package is vote buying | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/202053/1/.html | publisher = Channel NewsAsia }}</ref><ref> {{cite news | title = Too much of a good thing? | date = 28 February 2006 | publisher = Today (newspaper) | url = http://www.todayonline.com/articles/103693.asp }}</ref>

===Workers' Party manifesto===
The [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]] (WP) launched an update to its [[manifesto]] on 14 January 2006, becoming the first party to do so.<ref> {{cite news | title =  Workers' Party unveils manifesto, plans to contest 3 single wards & 4 GRCs | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 14 January 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/188214/1/.html }} - by Farah Abdul Rahim</ref> Amongst its policy proposals, WP called for the Presidency to revert to its former ceremonial role and the abolishment of the [[Group representation constituency|GRCs]], the [[Ethnic Integration Policy]] for [[Housing and Development Board]] flats, the [[Resident Committee]]s and the [[Citizen Consultative Committee]]s. It also revealed its intentions to establish a central agency in the provision of public transport, set up of a national [[unemployment insurance]] scheme and a more comprehensive [[national health insurance]] scheme among a host of other things.

On 21 January, PAP launched a coordinated attack on the WP's proposals, describing four of their proposals as "four time bombs...[which] will weaken and tear Singapore apart".<ref> {{cite news | title =  Workers' Party manifesto threatens social harmony: Dr Ng Eng Hen | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 21 January 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/189345/1/.html }} - by May Wong</ref> [[Khaw Boon Wan]], revealed various changes in medical policies, including the [[Medisave]] scheme, which had been a constant target for criticism by opposition parties. He also chided the WP for its "failure to understand what makes inter-racialism work in Singapore and why we are different from the rest of the world", referring the four points brought up by Ng Eng Hen as "poisons"<ref> Straits Times, 22 January 2006</ref> Workers' Party Chairman [[Sylvia Lim]] released a press statement<ref> {{cite news | title = Workers' Party Manifesto 2006 - Response to Ministers' Remarks | publisher = Workers' Party of Singapore | date = 22 January 2006 | url = http://www.wp.sg/news/press_releases/20060122_manifesto.htm }} - by [[Sylvia Lim]]</ref> on 22 January, responding to each of the four "time bombs" criticised by Ng and adding that the party was standing firmly by its manifesto.<ref> {{cite news | title =  The Workers' Party on those four 'time bombs' | publisher = Today (Singapore newspaper) | date = 23 January 2006 | url = http://www.todayonline.com/articles/96784.asp }} - by Lee U-Wen</ref>

===Goh Chok Tong's special assignment===
On 19 March, [[Lee Hsien Loong]] said that PAP was aiming to win all the constituencies including the two opposition wards in Hougang SMC and Potong Pasir SMC, stating that "We want to win, this is not masak-masak <nowiki>[a Malay term meaning a child's game]</nowiki>".{{citation needed|February 2010}} The PAP candidates for these two wards would be Eric Low and Sitoh Yih Pin respectively. Both lost in the previous elections but had been working the ground in these wards since. They were assisted by [[Goh Chok Tong]] who had been given the special assignment to help the PAP win the two wards.<ref> {{cite news | title =  SM Goh to help PAP candidates win back Hougang, Potong Pasir seats  | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 19 March 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/198700/1/.html }}</ref>

Goh had suggested that if Eric Low and Sitoh Yih Pin won the election, they would be given extra latitude when speaking and voting in parliament and not be subjected to the political [[Whip (politics)|Whip]]. Goh also said that he would help Sitoh to gain a post in the new Cabinet if he was elected.<ref> {{cite news | title =  I'll push for Sitoh in Cabinet if he wins, vows SM Goh  | date = 28 March 2006 | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/200228/1/.html }}</ref> Hougang and Potong Pasir residents were also been promised housing upgrades worth $100 million and $80 million dollars respectively if PAP was to retake the two seats. Since they were won by opposition parties, both of these constituencies have not been selected for housing upgrading or provided with lifts that stop on every floor. When the PAP shaved the Worker's Party's vote share from 58% to 55% in the 1997 General Election, then prime-minister Goh offered to upgrade Hougang estate if the WP's chief's share of vote was reduced to 52%.{{citation needed|February 2010}} Nonetheless, Hougang remains in opposition hands.

===Remarks in ''The New Democrat''===
In April 2006, the SDP published an article headlined "Govt's role in the NKF scandal" in the SDP party newspaper ''The New Democrat'' regarding the [[National Kidney Foundation Singapore scandal]].  On 22 April, [[letters of demand]] were served on twelve members of the SDP and the publisher. [[Drew and Napier]], the law firm acting for Lee Hsien Loong and Lee Kuan Yew, said that the newspaper article had alleged that the two Lees were "dishonest and unfit for office", that Lee Kuan Yew "devised a corrupt political system for the benefit of the political elite", and that he managed the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation in a "corrupt manner". In addition, according to the letter of demand, the newspaper also alleged that Lee Hsien Loong had "perpetuated a corrupt political system for the benefit of the political elite" and how he and his Government "had access to the information which has now been unearthed about NKF but corruptly concealed and covered up the facts to avoid criticism".<ref> {{cite news | title = PM, MM demand apology from SDP over NKF remarks | publisher = TODAY | date = 22 April 2006 | url = http://www.todayonline.com/articles/114121.asp }}</ref> The letters demanded that damages be paid and an apology made in the media by 25 April.<ref name="cna_210406_nkf"> {{cite news | title = PM Lee, MM Lee demand apology from SDP for NKF remarks | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 21 April 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/204256/1/.html }}</ref>

Four of SDP's eleven committee members later apologised, while the chairman of the party had refused to apologise as it would constitute "an admission of guilt". An apology had been formally rejected by the party, though the party would not oppose individual members from making personal apologies. M Ravi, the lawyer representing most of the accused, had rejected claims made in the letters that allegations made in the paper were "highly defamatory", and he "[does] not see how a government or public body could be defamed". On 27 April, Chee said that the threat of legal action was already seriously affecting SDP's campaign at Sembawang GRC: "Lawyers for Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Mr Lee Hsien Loong have gone as far as to sue the printer, so much so that he is so frightened he dares not publish our election material."<ref name="today_28april_sdp"> {{cite news | title = SDP papers over Ling-Chee cracks | publisher = Today | date = 28 April 2006 | url =  http://www.todayonline.com/articles/115309.asp }}</ref> SDP was still seen selling the publication, and the Lees were seeking aggravated damages.<ref> {{cite news | title =  Chee adamant, but SDP member apologises  | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 25 April 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/204776/1/.html }}</ref><ref> {{cite news | title =

===SDP podcast===

On 25 April, Elections Department warned SDP that it would take action against the party if they did not remove audio files and [[podcasts]] from the party's website as they were against election advertising regulations under the [[Parliamentary Elections Act]]. Within hours after the notice was issued, SDP posted a notice on its website that the podcast service was suspended.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/204846/1/.html | title =  	 SDP told to remove podcasts from website | date = 25 April 2006 | publisher = Channel NewsAsia}}</ref>

On 10 March 2006, the major opposition parties held a meeting, after which they announced their intention to contest 57 of the 84 seats in Parliament.<ref name= "cna_10mar06_opp"> {{cite news |  title = Opposition parties unveil plan to contest 57 seats in next General Election | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 10 March 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/197193/1/.html }}</ref> Nonetheless, the full detail of the opposition's plan was not revealed until Nomination Day itself. Steve Chia told reporters: "Any self-respecting politician will hold his cards close to his chest."<ref> {{cite news | title = All smiles, but what happened? | publisher = Today (Singapore newspaper) | date = 7 March 2006 | url = http://www.todayonline.com/articles/105058.asp }}</ref>

There were nine SMCs with 1 seat each for the election. For smaller political parties and independents who do not have sufficient candidates and resources to contest the GRCs, the SMCs were the only constituencies that they could afford to run. In addition, many believe that opposition candidates have a higher chance of winning in SMCs than in GRCs. Since there were only nine SMCs, all were expected to be contested. The opposition tried to avoid three-cornered fights by coordinating with each other. [[Chiam See Tong]] (SPP) said that "if we enter into one <nowiki>[</nowiki>three-cornered fight<nowiki>]</nowiki>, we're only going to kill ourselves. We're not that stupid."<ref name = "today_10mar06_opp"> {{cite news | title = Opposition should aim for a GRC win: Chiam | publisher =  Today (Singapore newspaper)  | date = 10 March 2006 | url = http://www.todayonline.com/articles/105822.asp }}</ref>

In March 2006, it was thought that there could be a potential three-cornered contest in MacPherson SMC, where both [[Mansor Rahman]], Chairman of Democratic Progressive Party, and [[Sin Kek Tong]], Chairman of Singapore People's Party had indicated their parties' interest to run for that seat. Later, the parties managed to reach an agreement and avoided the unfavourable contest. [[Tan Lead Shake]], previously a prominent member of DPP, later joined the [[Singapore Democratic Alliance]], and became a member of SDA's team contesting Tampines GRC.

By 26 April 2006, the opposition had indicated they would contest at least half of the seats in the 84 member Parliament. There were forty-seven candidates standing for election with ten new candidates facing the opposition. Candidates standing for election had only an hour to present their nomination papers, and must be accompanied by their proposers, seconders and assentors. Observers projected that 37 [[People's Action Party]] candidates from seven Group Representative Constituencies would return unopposed and the PAP would be denied a majority on nomination day,<ref> {{cite news | title = All eyes on whether PAP will stay in power on Nomination Day | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 26 April 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/205024/1/.html }}</ref> an eventuality that proved to be true.

===Early announcement of intention by parties ===
Some of the opposition parties, such as [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]] and [[Singapore Democratic Alliance]], adopted the strategy of announcing early their plans on which constituencies they intended to contest, even before changes in electoral boundaries were published. This was seen as a tactical move to earmark those divisions in order to discourage any third party from contesting in the same divisions leading to three-cornered fights.{{citation needed|February 2010}} Another cited reason was that, if the Government electoral commission redrew those boundaries, the opposition would be able to exploit such actions by accusing the PAP of gerrymandering to avoid the ballot challenge.<ref> {{cite news | title =HOT tactic HOT seats HOT air | publisher = Electric New Paper | date = 11 February 2006 | url = http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/error/0,6313,6,00.html? }}</ref>

=== Nomination day results===
[[File:Singapore GE 2006, contested seats.png|right|thumb|200px|Electoral map showing the various contests. The PAP fielded candidates in all 84 seats, with 37 seats (shown in blue) won as walkovers on nomination day. The battlegrounds were the remaining 47 seats contested by WP (yellow), SDA (red), and SDP (green).]]
On nomination day<ref name="nominationbbc" /> 7 GRCs totalling 37 seats, were uncontested and returned to the PAP. This was less than half the number of 84 seats, and for the first time since 1988, the PAP was not returned to power on nomination day. The Elections Department announced that over 1.2 million Singaporeans, 56.6% of eligible voters, would be able to cast votes. 

The opposition parties' 47 candidates for the 2006 election was a large increase from the 29 candidates in the previous election in 2001. In addition, there was no three-cornered fight as all contests were between the PAP and one opposition party. There was also no independent candidate participating in this election; this was a rare occurrence as independent candidates had participated in every election since 1955, except in 1980.{{citation needed|February 2010}}

===Diversity of candidates===

All eighteen candidates for the SMCs were male Chinese. On 28 April, Lee Kuan Yew (PAP) referred to this fact when defending the [[Group Representation Constituency]] (GRC) system on the grounds that it ensures minority and women representation in parliament.<ref> {{cite news| url = http://www.todayonline.com/articles/115561.asp | title = MM Lee explains his tough stance against Opposition, throws a challenge | publisher = Today | date = 29 April 2006}}</ref> Nonetheless, there is no requirement that GRCs should have at least one female candidate.

Over the years, each GRC team has been steadily increased by the government from 3 to 5 or 6 members. WP had called for the abolishment of the GRC system which it considered as a means introduced by the PAP to make it difficult for opposition who lack sufficient resource to contest the large electoral division.{{citation needed|February 2010}}

With the nominations completed, the opposition was contesting 47 seats with the remaining 37 returned to the PAP. The PAP was thus denied a walkover majority to form a government on nomination day, the first time since 1988.<ref name="nominationbbc" /><ref> {{cite news | url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-04/27/content_4483135.htm  | title = More contests in general election good for Singapore: PM | date = 27 April 2006 | publisher = Xinhuanet.com }}</ref><ref> {{cite news| title = Singapore's election - A rational choice | url = http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displayStory.cfm?story_id=6838543 | date = 20 April 2006 | publisher = The Economist }}</ref>

Between 28 April to 5 May, a total of 50 political rallies were held by the parties at 24 designated sites during nine days of campaign.  The "Lunchtime Rally Site" at [[Boat Quay]], next to [[UOB Plaza]], made a comeback in the election; it was removed from the list of rally sites in the [[Singapore general election, 2001|previous election]] due to fears of terrorist attacks after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].<ref> {{cite web| title = Media Release - Election Meeting Sites | date = 27 April 2006| publisher = Singapore Police Force | url = http://www.spf.gov.sg/mediarelease/2006/2006.htm#}}</ref>

The Workers' Party had put up their strongest team, consisting of its more prominent candidates led by Chairman Sylvia Lim, to contest [[Aljunied GRC]] challenging the PAP team led by [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Singapore)|Foreign Affairs Minister]] [[George Yeo]]. The constituency eventually had the fiercest GRC contest in the election. The strongest GRC team for the SDA was one contesting [[Jalan Besar GRC]]. It was led by [[Sebestian Teo]] and its members include former MP [[Cheo Chai Chen]].

The hotly contested Single Member Constituencies include [[Chua Chu Kang SMC]] where incumbent MP and [[Minister for Education|Minister of State for Education]] and [[Minister for Manpower|Manpower]] [[Gan Kim Yong]] was challenged by NSP's secretary-general [[Steve Chia]]. [[Low Thia Khiang]] (WP), the incumbent MP for [[Hougang SMC]] faced a strong challenged from PAP's [[Eric Low Siak Meng]]. [[Nee Soon East SMC]] was hotly contested with [[Minister for Law (Singapore)|Senior Minister of State for Law]] and [[Minister for Home Affairs (Singapore)|Home Affairs]] [[Ho Peng Kee]] against [[Poh Lee Guan]] (WP). [[Potong Pasir SMC]], another opposition seat held by [[Chiam See Tong]] since 1984 was also hotly contested by PAP's [[Sitoh Yih Pin]].

Workers' Party fielded a very young team in Ang Mo Kio GRC, with candidates mostly born after 1965, to compete with the flagship PAP team led by Lee Hsien Loong.<ref> {{cite news | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/205258/1/.html | title = The straight-forward fight | date = 27 April 2006 | publisher = Channel NewsAsia }}</ref> On 29 April 2006, Lee referred to his opponents at [[Ang Mo Kio GRC]] as "<U+6562><U+6B7B><U+961F>" (suicide squad) adding that even the bookies would not take bets on the outcome in that constituency contest.<ref> {{ cite news| url = http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4136,105715,00.html | title = PM Lee comes out boxing | publisher = Electric New Paper| date = 29 April 2006}}</ref> In response, Low Thia Kiang of the WP said that it was better to be a "<U+6562><U+6B7B><U+961F>" (suicide squad) and not a "<U+6015><U+6B7B><U+961F>" (squad that is scared to die).

===James Gomez saga===
{{main|James Gomez}}
Controversy arose during the election surrounding the application for a minority-race candidate certificate by [[James Gomez]] of [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]].{{citation needed|February 2010}} On the 24 April, Gomez went to the [[Elections Department]] to fill up the minority-race candidate certificate application form accompanied by the chairperson [[Sylvia Lim]]. Instead of handing in the application form to election official, Gomez slipped the form in his bag and went off for an interview. At the time, Sylvia Lim had gone to a waiting area and did not witness the event. 

On the eve of Nomination Day, James Gomez went to collect his minority-race candidate certificate claiming he had submitted the application form. After failing to get the certificate, Gomez warned an elections officer of the "consequences". At 1pm that day, an Elections Department staff called Gomez and told him that he did not submit the Indian and minority candidate certificate form. During the call, which was recorded, Gomez changed his story and said that he would get back to them. When the media asked him about the issue, Gomez initially refused to discuss about the issue, but later conceded.<ref> {{cite news | title = Elections Dept releases CCTV pictures on encounter with James Gomez | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 29 April 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/205555/1/.html }}</ref> Following two days of dispute between both sides, the Elections Department was able to produce video evidence showing that James Gomez did not submit the application form; a day later, James Gomez apologised to the Elections Department at a Worker's Party rally saying he was distracted by his busy schedule.<ref> {{cite news | title = WP's Gomez admits he did not submit form to Elections Dept | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 29 April 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/205664/1/.html }}</ref>

During the controversy, PAP raised questions about the credibility of Gomez. He was accused of attempting to discredit the Elections Department by claiming they misplaced the form. Two PAP leaders [[Wong Kan Seng]] and [[Lee Kuan Yew]] called Gomez a "liar" and Lee dared Gomez to sue him and Wong.<ref name="cna_020506_mmlee"> {{cite news | title =  MM Lee says Gomez is a liar, a bad egg in Workers' Party | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 2 May 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/206150/1/.html }}</ref> [[George Yeo]] (PAP) also suggested that the Worker's Party should sack Gomez and field a four-member team for the five-member Group Representation Constituency. This was rejected by Low who asserted that PAP was trying to divert public and media attention from main election issues.<ref> {{cite news | title =  Lose Gomez and get back on track: FM Yeo to WP | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 4 May 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/206457/1/.html }}</ref>

===Party political broadcast===
On both 29 April 2006 and 4 May 2006, the four contesting parties made their political broadcasts over television and radio in the four official languages &mdash; the English, [[Mandarin language|Mandarin]], [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] languages. Each party was given an allocated time based on the number of candidates it fielded. The People's Action Party (PAP) was given 12 minutes with 84 candidates fielded, the Workers' Party (WP) and Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) were given 4.5 minutes each with 20 candidates fielded, and the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) was given 2.5 minutes with 7 candidates fielded. The SDP was represented by [[Chee Siok Chin]], the Workers' Party by [[Sylvia Lim]] on the first broadcast and by [[Tan Hui Hua]] on the second broadcast, the SDA by [[Chiam See Tong]] on both broadcasts, with the PAP by Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] on the first broadcast and by PAP chairman [[Lim Boon Heng]] on the second broadcast.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=194575 | publisher = Bernama | title = S'pore Election: Parties Speak To S'poreans Via Political Broadcasts | author =  Jackson Sawatan | date = 30 April 2006 }}</ref>

===Debate on housing and lift upgrading===
The upgrading of public housing, including the [[Lift Upgrading Programme]] (LUP), was a major issue in this election.{{citation needed|February 2010}} As in previous elections, PAP had tied the scheduling of housing upgrades to the number of votes the party received in the election. The PAP argued that government was successful in raising the standard of living in the country, and those who supported its various policies, including the upgrading, should be given priority. In the hotly contested Aljunied GRC, George Yeo (PAP) placed lift upgrading the "top of [his] priority list" so that the lift would stop on every floor in as many blocks as possible.<ref>{{cite news | title = PAP team in Aljunied says lift upgrading tops priority list | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 28 April 2006 | author = Sithara Doriasamy | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/205449/1/.html }}</ref> Sylvia Lim (WP) accused the PAP of being selective in its upgrading programmes, arguing that this was a divisive policy.<ref>{{cite news | title = Looking out for workers | publisher = Today, Channel NewsAsia | date = 3 May 2006 | author = Val Chua and Loh Chee Kong | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/206223/1/.html }}</ref>

===Large turnout at opposition election rallies===
The election featured large turnouts at some of the election rallies of the opposition parties, which was unheard of since the 1980s. A report by Malaysian press ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'' estimated that around 10,000 people attended the Workers' Party rally on 30 April at Hougang.<ref name="star_rally">{{cite news | title = Taking on the mighty PAP | date = 2 May 2006 | author = Joceline Tan | publisher = The Star | url = http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/5/2/focus/14119745&sec=focus }}</ref> At the last rally of the Workers' Party at Serangoon Stadium on 5 May, the audience filled up most of the field and even spilled outside the stadium. However the local media did not report on the large turnout at all, this prompted widespread criticisms on the credibility of the Singapore media on local political issues.  

The PAP dismissed the significance of the crowds, suggesting that crowd size would not necessarily translate into votes.<ref name="star_rally"/>

===Victory parades===
[[File:Polling Centre, Nan Chiau Primary School, May 06.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Voters await to cast their votes at the polling centre at [[Nan Chiau Primary School]] for [[Ang Mo Kio GRC]].]]
To continue with tradition, the winning candidates toured their constituencies to thank voters for their victory in the election.<ref>{{cite news| title =  Singapore won big: SM Goh | publisher = Today, Channel NewsAsia | date = 8 May 2006 | author = Loh Chee Kong | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/207143/1/.html }}</ref> These parades were held in all contested seats as well as walkover [[Constituencies of Singapore|Group Representation Constituencies]]. Victory parades are usually held in the late morning and early afternoon in conjunction with other events organised by the [[grassroot]]s committee.{{citation needed|February 2010}} The candidates were driven on trucks as they broadcasted message of appreciation to the residents. Some losing candidates also toured their constituencies to thank their supporters although their parades were usually smaller than those of the winning candidates.

===Non-Constituency Member of Parliament===
The [[Elections Department]] announced that one member of the [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]] team for [[Aljunied GRC]] would be appointed as [[Non-Constituency Member of Parliament]]. The team had received 44% of the votes, the highest losing votes in the 2006 election. The Central Executive Committee voted for [[Sylvia Lim]] to be the NCMP with nine in favour and one objected. Lim would not represent any constituency but she said she was looking forward to the opportunity to fulfil her obligation to supporters and also to voice people's concerns. She took over from incumbent NCMP [[Steve Chia]].<ref>  {{cite news | title =  Singapore's Workers' Party names chairman Sylvia Lim as next NCMP | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 9 May 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/207449/1/.html }}</ref>

===Detaining and questioning of Gomez===
On 7 May 2006, a day after the elections, Gomez was detained by police at [[Singapore Changi Airport]] when he was about to take a flight to [[Sweden]] for work. The police was investigating an "alleged offences of criminal intimidation and providing false information".  The Elections Department had earlier filed a police report regarding the incident during the election period in which Gomez spoke to an election official in a threatening tone, an episode that was caught on [[closed-circuit television]]. Gomez was brought to the [[Criminal Investigations Department]] (CID) at [[Police Cantonment Complex]] for questioning and to file his statement, after which he was released at midnight.<ref>  {{cite news | title =  WP's Gomez detained over Elections Department complaint | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 7 May 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/207083/1/.html }}</ref> His [[passport]] was impounded by the police to prevent him from leaving the country and his [[air ticket]] was forfeited as it was non-refundable. He also suffered a loss of income due to his absence from work.

On that night, [[Sylvia Lim]] and [[Low Thia Khiang]] were also asked to give statements at the CID. On 9 May, Gomez was called again to CID for a questioning session that lasted five hours. Gomez later told the media that he was giving the police "the fullest cooperation."<ref>  {{cite news | title =  James Gomez questioned by police for second time  | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 9 May 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/207405/1/.html }}</ref>

After three questioning sessions, James was let off with a stern warning by the police who issued a statement stating that the public prosecutor was satisfied that Gomez had committed the offence of using threatening words towards a civil servant but the police decided to release Gomez as he had no prior criminal records.<ref>  {{cite news | title =  WP's Gomez let off with stern warning in run-in with Elections Dept | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 12 May 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/207972/1/.html }}</ref> His passport was returned to him and he left for Sweden on 16 May.

===Chee Siok Chin's challenge of polling results===
On 24 May 2006, SDP member Chee Siok Chin filed a [[summons]] on the High Court asking to declare the election results void. In her affidavit, Chee claimed that the PAP had used the HDB upgrading scheme and gave out shares and cash to induce voters to vote for the party and hence secure electoral victory. Chee also wanted the High Court to declare the ban on podcasting during election period as unconstitutional.<ref> {{cite news | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | title = SDP's Chee Siok Chin wants High Court to void GE results | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/210016/1/.html | date = 2006-05-24}}</ref> Chee did not pay the $5000 security costs on time, and the Elections Department did not accept her payment as a result. Senior State Counsel [[Jeffrey Chan]] said her petition would be deemed to have lapsed the moment she failed to meet the deadline to furnish the security amount for costs and asked the election [[judge]] to dismiss the matter.<ref> {{cite news | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | title = Judgment reserved on Attorney General's petition to dismiss Chee's suit on GE | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/213241/1/.html | date = 2006-06-12}}</ref> On 22 June, Election Judge [[Andrew Phang]] dismissed her application and awarded costs to the [[Attorney General]] whom Chee had named as defendant. Her attempt to extend her security deposit payment time was denied by the High Court. As a result, a hearing scheduled on 27 June did not take place. Chee had not follow the rules of the [[Parliamentary Elections Act]] which requires them to pay the security deposit within three days after filing the petition.<ref> {{cite news | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | title = SDP's Chee Siok Chin loses petition to extend time to pay deposit for GE court suit | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/215108/1/.html | date = 2006-06-22}}</ref>

===New cabinet===
The [[Cabinet of Singapore|new cabinet]] was sworn-in on 30 May 2006. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made few changes in his administration. In the only change at the ministerial level, [[Raymond Lim]] was promoted to be the [[Minister for Transport (Singapore)|Minister for Transport]] replacing [[Yeo Cheow Tong]]. Five new faces were sworn into political office, namely [[Lui Tuck Yew]], [[Lee Yi Shyan]], [[Grace Fu]], [[Teo Ser Luck]] and [[Masagos Zulkifli]]. They hold the roles of [[Minister of State]] or Parliamentary secretaries in political office. [[Minister for Education (Singapore)|Minister for Education]] [[Tharman Shanmugaratnam]] was given another role as Second Minister for Finance. Transport Minister Raymond Lim relinquished his roles as Second Minister for Finance and Minister in the [[Prime Minister's Office]]. [[Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports]] [[Vivian Balakrishnan]] also had a second post as [[Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts|Second Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts]] as he relinquished his Second Minister for Trade and Industry [[Portfolio (government)|portfolio]]. Senior Minister of State [[Balaji Sadasivan]] relinquished his position as Senior Minister of State for Ministry of Health for the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Singapore)|Foreign Affairs Ministry]]. However, he continued as Senior Minister for State for the MICA. [[Heng Chee How]] took Balaji's place as Senior Minister of State for Health; he relinquished his appointments in the [[Ministry of National Development (Singapore)|Ministry of National Development]] and Mayor for the [[Central Community Development Council]]. [[Zainul Abidin Rasheed]] was appointed Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and [[Koo Tsai Kee]] Minister of State for Defence. Re-elected MPs namely [[S Iswaran]], [[Amy Khor]] and [[Zainudin Nordin]] took political office as well.<ref> {{cite news | first=Hasnita A | last= Majid | title =  PM Lee announces changes to Cabinet line-up | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 22 May 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/209664/1/.html }}</ref>

==Influence of the Internet==
The [[Internet]] played a much more significant role compared to previous general elections. Singapore has a large number of computer users, with 74% of households owning computers and 2 in 3 households having Internet access.<ref> {{cite news | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | title =  More Singaporeans own computers, have internet access: survey | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/195176/1/.html | date = 26 February 2006 }}</ref> Podcasts, blogs, and online political discussions have become common in Singaporean cyberspace. A blog called "SGRally"<ref> [http://sgrally.blogspot.com/ SG Rally: The Singapore Elections Rally Archive]</ref> was set up to collect recorded rally speeches in this election. Opposition candidates had complained about insufficient rally sites allocated to them in past elections.

In August 2005, [[Singapore Democratic Party]] became the first political party in Singapore to launch a [[podcast]] called ''RadioSDP'' on its party website.<ref> {{cite news | title = Dr Chee takes his message on to the Internet | publisher = Today (Singapore newspaper) | date = 5 August 2005 | url = http://www.todayonline.com/articles/65131.asp }}</ref> Several members of the Workers' Party are active in [[blogsphere]]; the notable bloggers are [[James Gomez]], [[Goh Meng Seng]], and [[Melvin Tan]].

On 25 February 2006, the Department of Political Science, [[National University of Singapore]] organised a public forum on politics titled "The (In)Significance of Political Elections in Singapore?" Among the speakers were 2nd Assistant Secretary-General of [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]] [[James Gomez]], [[Nominated Member of Parliament]] (NMP) [[Geh Min]], and former NMP [[Chandra Mohan]]. A recording of the forum is available via podcast.<ref> [http://nuscast.nus.edu.sg/ NUScast: The (In)significance of Political Elections in Singapore.] - [[National University of Singapore]], 25 February 2006.</ref>

===Regulations===
[[File:Today, bloggers at elections dot net.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An article in ''Today'' newspaper on 18 March 2006 describes the issues concerning political websites during election period. Anonymous bloggers are depicted as faces covered by paper bags.]]

Regulation of political content online was an issue throughout the election period.
The [[Media Development Authority]] (MDA) had reminded Internet content providers to comply with the [[law of Singapore]], including those relating to political content. Online bloggers and podcasts are subject to the [[Parliamentary Elections Act]].<ref> {{cite news | title =  Bloggers, podcasts online may be subject to Parliamentary Elections Act | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 19 February 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/193907/1/.html }}</ref><ref name="statutes_chap218"> [http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/ Singapore Statutes Online] Parliamentary Elections Act (Chapter 218)</ref>

In a notification issued by MDA under the [[Broadcasting Act]],<ref>Singapore Statutes, Chapter 28, Section 9</ref><ref> [http://www.mda.gov.sg/wms.file/mobj/mobj.487.ClassLicence.pdf Broadcasting (Class Licence) Notification], (PDF) [[Media Development Authority]], 15 July 1996</ref> all political websites are required to register with the MDA. These websites include those belonging to political parties as well as to "individuals, groups, organisations and corporations engaged in providing any programme for the propagation, promotion or discussion of political or religious issues relating to Singapore on the World Wide Web through the Internet."<ref> [http://www.mda.gov.sg/wms.www/devnpolicies.aspx?sid=161#5 Internet Policies and Guidelines] Media Development Authority, Singapore.</ref> A MDA spokesperson said that only a handful of websites have registered and that they mostly belonged to political parties or registered political associations. 

Political analyst Cherian George noted that the regulation would hinder the development of [[citizen journalism]] in Singapore.<ref> [http://singaporemedia.blogspot.com/  Election Coverage & Commentary], Cherian George, 2 October 2005.</ref> A number of bloggers and political commentators had commented that the rules are too broadly defined and were unsure how they would be enforced. They protested that this was a violation of [[freedom of speech]]. A candidate [[Goh Meng Seng]] (WP) refused to register his blog, saying "I don't see the need to do so as an individual citizen. We have our rights to our political views."<ref> {{cite news | title = bloggers@elections.net | publisher = Today (Singapore newspaper) | date = 18 March 2006 | url = http://www.todayonline.com/articles/107441.asp }}</ref> 

In a parliament session on 3 April 2006, [[Balaji Sadasivan]], the senior minister of state for information, communications and the arts, made some clarification on the regulation in response to a question by [[Low Thia Khiang]]. Balaji said that podcasting and streaming of videos were prohibited during the election. On the other hand, pictures of election candidates, political party histories and manifestos were allowed to be used as election advertising on the Internet.
