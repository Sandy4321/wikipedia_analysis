'''HMS ''Active''''' was a {{Sclass|Volage|corvette}} built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the late 1860s. Launched in 1869, she entered service in 1873, and was the Commodore's ship on the [[South Atlantic Station|Cape of Good Hope and West Africa Station]]. Her crew served ashore in both the [[Anglo-Ashanti wars|Third Anglo-Ashanti]] and [[Anglo-Zulu War|Zulu Wars]]. From 1885 to 1898, the ship was the flagship of the Training Squadron. ''Active'' was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1906.

==Description==
''Active'' was {{convert|270|ft|m|1}} [[Length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|42|ft|1|in|m|1}}. Forward the ship had a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|16|ft|5|in|m|1}}, but aft she drew {{convert|21|ft|5|in|m|abbr=on|1}}. ''Active'' displaced {{convert|3078|LT|t}} and had a [[Builder's Old Measurement|burthen]] of 2,322 tons. Her iron hull was covered by a {{convert|3|in|adj=on}} layer of oak that was sheathed with copper from the waterline down to prevent [[biofouling]].<ref name=RW>Winfield, p. 265</ref> Watertight transverse [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s subdivided the hull.<ref>Ballard, p. 54</ref> Her crew consisted of 340 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=RW/>

The ship had one 2-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Back acting|horizontal return connecting rod-steam engine]] made by Humphreys and Tennant driving a single {{convert|19|ft|m|adj=on}} propeller.<ref name=RW/> Five rectangular [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s provided steam to the engine at a working pressure of {{convert|30|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref name=b5>Ballard, pp. 57<U+2013>58</ref> The engine produced a total of {{convert|4130|ihp|lk=in}} which gave ''Active'' a maximum speed of {{convert|15|kn|lk=in}}. The ship carried {{convert|410|LT|t}} of coal, enough to steam {{convert|2000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|knots}}.<ref name=RW/>

''Active'' was [[ship rig]]ged and had a sail area of {{convert|16593|sqft|sqm|0}}.<ref name=RW/> The lower masts were made of iron, but the other masts were wood. The ship's best speed under sail alone was {{convert|12.5|kn}}. Her [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] was semi-retractable to reduce wind resistance<ref name=b5/> and her propeller could be hoisted up into the stern of the ship to reduce drag while under sail.<ref name=RW/>

The ship was initially armed with a mix of [[RML 7 inch gun|7-inch]] and [[RML 64 pounder 64 cwt gun|64-pounder 64 cwt]]<ref group=Note>"cwt" is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 64 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.</ref> [[Muzzle-loading rifle|rifled muzzle-loading guns]]. The six {{convert|7|in|adj=on|0}} guns and two of the four 64-pounders were mounted on the broadside while the other two were mounted on the [[forecastle]] and [[poop deck]] as [[chase gun]]s.<ref>Ballard, pp. 55<U+2013>56</ref> In 1879, ten [[BL 6 inch 80 pounder gun|BL 6-inch 80-pounder]] [[Rifled breech loader|breech-loading guns]] replaced all the broadside weapons. Two carriages for {{convert|14|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedoes]] were added as well.<ref name=RW/>

==Service==
HMS ''Active'' was [[Keel|laid down]] in 1867 and launched on 13 March 1869. The ship was completed in March 1871 at a total cost of <U+00A3>126,156. Of this, <U+00A3>85,795 was spent on her hull and <U+00A3>40,361 on her machinery.<ref name=RW/> Unlike her [[sister ship]] {{HMS|Volage|1869|2}}, ''Active'' was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] after completion until 1873 when she was commissioned to serve as the [[flagship]] of the [[Commander-in-Chief]], Cape of Good Hope and West Coast of Africa Station, [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] [[William Nathan Wrighte Hewett|William Hewett]]. The ship participated in naval operations during the Third Anglo-Ashanti War of 1874 and some of her crew were landed to reinforce the forces ashore. Commodore [[Sir Francis Sullivan, 6th Baronet|Francis Sullivan]] replaced Hewett in 1876 and he retained command until 1879 when the ship returned home to refit.<ref name=b1>Ballard, p. 61</ref>

===Zulu War===
Between 19 November 1878 and 21 July 1879, during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], 173 men of ''Active'' (along with men from {{HMS|Tenedos|1870|2}}, {{HMS|Shah|1873|2}} and {{HMS|Boadicea|1875|2}}) served ashore as part of a 858-man [[Naval Brigade]]. The group from ''Active'' comprised 10 officers, 100 seamen, 5 idlers, 42 Marines, 14 [[Kroomen]], and 2 medical attendants.<ref name="Gazette24780">{{London Gazette|issue=24780|date=7 November 1879|startpage=6310|endpage=6312|accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref> In addition to [[small arms]], they were equipped with two [[RBL 12 pounder 8 cwt Armstrong gun|12-pounder breech-loading guns]], 24-pounder rockets, and a [[Gatling gun]]. The 12-pounders were exchanged for two of the Army's [[RML 7 pounder Mountain Gun|7-pounder mountain guns]] before entering [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hall |first=D.D. |year=1979 |month=January |title=Artillery in the Zulu War 1879 |journal=Military History Journal |volume=Vol.4 |issue=No.4 |location= |publisher=The South African Military History Society |id= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode= |doi= |accessdate=3 January 2012 |url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol044dh.html }}</ref>

Attached to the No.1 Column commanded by Colonel [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]], they crossed the [[Tugela River]] from [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] into Zululand on 12 January 1879.<ref name="Gazette24780"/> On 22 January they saw action in the [[Battle of Inyezane]], driving off an attacking force of Zulus with rockets, [[Martini-Henry]] [[rifle]]s and the Gatling gun.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=24693|date=11 March 1879|startpage=2047|endpage=2048|accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref> The same day the British main force was defeated at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]], and so Pearson's column advanced to [[Eshowe]], were it was [[Siege of Eshowe|besieged for two months]], until relieved on 3 April.<ref name="Gazette24780"/> During the campaign, ''Active''{{'}}s crew suffered only one man killed, and nine wounded in action against the enemy, while nine died of disease during the siege, and one man drowned while crossing the Tugela.<ref name="Gazette24780"/> In 1881 the [[South Africa Medal (1877)|South Africa Medal]] was awarded to those members of ''Active''{{'}}s crew that had served there.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=25007|date=23 August 1881|startpage=4340|accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref>

===Training Squadron===
''Active'' was rearmed and refitted in 1879 and placed in reserve until she was selected in 1885 to be the commodore's flagship in the newly-formed Training Squadron. ''Active'' was the last [[square-rigged]] naval ship to leave [[Portsmouth]] Harbour under sail. She was [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]] in 1898<ref name=b1/> and was sold for scrap on 10 July 1906.<ref name=RW/>

A memorial to the men of ''Active'' who lost their lives during the African campaigns can be found in [[Victoria Park, Portsmouth]].<ref name="inportsmouth">{{cite web |url= http://www.memorials.inportsmouth.co.uk/city-centre/active.htm |title=Memorials and Monuments in Portsmouth City Centre (HMS ''Active'') |work=memorials.inportsmouth.co.uk |year=2010 |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref>
