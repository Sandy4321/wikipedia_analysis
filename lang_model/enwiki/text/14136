'''Eaton Site''' is a historic [[archeological site]] located at [[West Seneca, New York|West Seneca]] in [[Erie County, New York]]. It contains a record of small, intermittently occupied campsites from the Early Archaic (c. 8,000 B.C.E.) though the Late Woodland (c. 1,200 C.E.) periods and an [[Iroquois|Iroquoian village]] dating to around 1550 C.E. The site also contains materials from the early 19th century, when it was part of the [[Buffalo Creek Reservation]], and traces of late 19th and 20th century materials. The land was sold in 1842 and the site was used as farmland until the early 1950's.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2007AM/finalprogram/abstract_130437.htm|title=ENIGMA OF A LEAD TOOTH: COMPOSITION OF LEAD ITEMS FROM THE HISTORIC PHASE OF THE EATON SITE|date=2009-07-30|work=Abstracts, 2007 GSA Denver Annual Meeting (28<U+2013>31 October 2007)|publisher=The Geological Society of America (GSA)}}</ref>
