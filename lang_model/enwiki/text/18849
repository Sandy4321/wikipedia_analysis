'''Ashby de la Launde''' is a small village, part of the [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] of [[Ashby de la Launde and Bloxholm]], in the [[North Kesteven]] district of [[Lincolnshire]], England.

The village is located just west of [[Digby, Lincolnshire|Digby]], and east of the [[A15 road (Great Britain)|A15]] and [[B1191 road]]s. The suffix reflects the family de la Launde, which held the [[Lord of the Manor|Lordship of the Manor]] here after the marriage of Cecily, sister and heiress of Jordan de Ashby with William de la Launde (died 1345).<ref>A.R. Maddison, ''Lincolnshire Pedigrees'', (Harleian Society) vol 4, 1906, pp1192ff.</ref>

In [[Domesday Book]] the village is called ''Ashebi'', comprising two manors, in the possession of Ralph Paynel and Kolsveinn of Lincoln.<ref>[http://domesdaymap.co.uk/place/TF0555/ashby-de-la-launde/ Domesday on-line].</ref> A later lord, William becoame a [[Knights Templar|Knight Templar]] and gifted lands to create the [[Temple Bruer]] preceptory, which in time became the second wealthiest in Britain, funding the Crusades from sheep rearing and wool exports to Europe.  The marriage between the Asherbie (Ashby) family and Laundes from Laceby created the Anglicised Ashby de la Launde title for the settlement. 

There is a [[church (building)|church]] dedicated to [[Saint Hybald]] and a [[hall]]. 

==Ashby Hall==

Ashby Hall was built in 1595 by Edward King. It remained in the King family until the late 19th century when it passed through the female line to [[William Vere Reeve King-Fane|Colonel William Vere Reeve King-Fane]]. Between the years 1814 and 1835 it was let to a Mrs Gardner as a girls' school. 

The hall was home to [[Edward King (Parliamentarian)|Colonel Edward King]] (c 1606 - 1681) Member of Parliament for [[Great Grimsby (UK Parliament constituency)|Great Grimsby]] as was his father-in-law [[Edward Ayscough (died 1668)|Sir Edward Ayscough]]. Colonel King was a strong supporter of [[Oliver Cromwell]], serving as a Captain in the Parliamentary army and as Governor of Boston during the Commonwealth. Despite his strong republican and nonconformist beliefs, he is credited as being the first Member of Parliament to call for the [[restoration of Charles II]].

In 1841 the Hall and estate passed to John William King who was also the [[parson]] of Ashby. Now [[Landed gentry|squire]] and parson he took over the [[stables]] and [[Stud farm|stud]] and set about breeding [[racehorses]]. In 1874 his [[filly]] [[Apology (horse)|Apology]] won the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]] of [[the Thousand Guineas]], [[Epsom Oaks|the Oaks]] and [[St. Leger Stakes|the St Leger]]. His activities came to the notice of [[Christopher Wordsworth|Bishop Wordsworth]] of Lincoln who demanded his resignation from his church positions. King resigned a year later and died shortly afterwards. 

The Hall was sold in 1925 by Colonel [[William Vere Reeve King-Fane]] of [[Fulbeck]] to [[Baron Garvagh|George Canning, Baron Garvagh]] who had sold his Irish estates in [[Garvagh]] near Londonderry and moved his family to Ashby Hall.  Lord Garvagh rebuilt and modernised parts of the Hall, and during the Great Depression, to keep his staff employed, he built a large wooden indoor Badminton court which in later years became the present Village Hall; it has been relocated today in the centre of the village. Lord Garvagh moved to Keswick at the beginning of World War 2, and by 1942 various fighter squadrons at [[RAF Digby]] had taken over Ashby Hall as their officer's mess. One of the most notable was [[No. 609 Squadron RAF|609 Squadron]] (White Rose). By the end of the war the house became derelict and stood empty until the estate were broken up in the late 1950s. The park was cleared of its magnificent oak trees, the walled garden and surrounding farms sold separately, leaving the Hall itself to become the Lake Rendezvous Club, featuring many famous acts in its cabaret including [[Diana Dors]], [[Bob Monkhouse]] and [[Ken Dodd]]. The Hall and Club was purchased by the Ward family in the late 1960s under the new name Ashby Country Club, eventually closing in 1992.  The Hall was then purchased by Eran Bauer and became the international headquarters of the defence and security manufacturing company Civil Defence Supply,<ref>[http://www.civil-defence.org Civil Defence Supply]</ref> who continue ownership to this day.
