[[Image:Vforvendettapubh.jpg|thumb|V (Hugo Weaving) and Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) in the Shadow Gallery. Evey is taken there after their escape from the BTN building.]]
'''''V for Vendetta''''' is a [[2006 in film|2006]] [[action movie|action]]-[[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] [[film director|directed]] by [[James McTeigue]] and produced by [[Joel Silver]] and the [[The Wachowski brothers|Wachowski brothers]], who also wrote the [[screenplay]]. The film is an adaptation of the [[graphic novel]] ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' by [[Alan Moore]] and [[David Lloyd (comic artist)|David Lloyd]]. Set in [[London]], [[England]] in a near-future [[dystopia]]n society, the film follows the mysterious [[V (comics)|V]], a [[freedom fighter]] seeking to effect [[sociopolitical]] change while simultaneously pursuing his own violent personal [[vendetta]]. The film stars [[Natalie Portman]] as [[Evey Hammond]], [[Hugo Weaving]] as [[V (comics)|V]], [[Stephen Rea]] as [[Eric Finch|Inspector Finch]] and [[John Hurt]] as [[Adam Susan|Chancellor Sutler]].

The film's release was originally scheduled for Friday, [[November 4]], [[2005]] (a day before the 400th [[Guy Fawkes Night]]), but was delayed; it opened on [[March 17]], [[2006]].  Alan Moore, facing his disappointment in both ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'' and ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', refused to view the film and subsequently distanced himself from it.  The filmmakers removed many of the [[anarchism|anarchist]] themes and [[illegal drugs|drug]] references present in the original story and also altered the political message to what they believed would be more relevant to a 2006 audience. 

==Plot==
<!-- Please do not add the date 2020 to the time of the film.  It has largely been agreed upon that that is not the correct date, it is closer to 2040 ("The Salt Flats" film was in 2015, followed by Valerie's 3 years of happiness with her lover, followed by an unknown time in Larkhill, followed by 20 years of V's work after the fire in Larkhill).  Also, please add no more images in here! -->
In the near future, Britain is ruled by a [[totalitarian]] regime called Norsefire. Evey Hammond, a young woman, is rescued from harassment by state police by a masked vigilante known as "V". After rescuing her, V takes Evey to a rooftop location to witness his spectacular destruction of the [[Old Bailey]] accompanied by [[Tchaikovsky]]'s [[1812 Overture]]. The regime explains the incident to the public as a planned demolition, but this is shown to be a lie when V takes over the state-run British Television Network (BTN) the same day. He broadcasts a message urging the people of Britain to rise up against the oppressive government on November 5 ([[Guy Fawkes Night]]); one year from that day, when V says he will destroy the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]].

Evey, who works at the BTN, helps V to escape, but in doing so, puts herself in danger. V saves Evey by bringing her to his lair, where she is told that she must stay in hiding with him for a year. She reluctantly stays for some time, but upon learning that V is killing government officials, she escapes to the home of one of her superiors, Gordon Deitrich, who is also a good friend (and, unlike in the comic, a homosexual who has hidden his true nature for fear of being arrested). However, the state police raid Gordon's home shortly afterwards, after Gordon satirises the High Chancellor in his talk show. Evey is captured as she tries to escape. She is incarcerated and tortured for days, including having her head shaved, finding solace only in notes left by another prisoner, Valerie. Evey is eventually told that she will be executed unless she reveals V's whereabouts. An exhausted Evey says she would rather die, and, surprisingly, is then released. V then reveals himself to have been her captor. Evey comes to realize that having faced her own death, she can now live without fear. She leaves V, promising to return before November 5.

Meanwhile, Chief Inspector Finch, while investigating V's activities, learns how Norsefire came to power, and about V<U+2019>s origins. Twenty years previously, Britain had suffered from war and terrorism. The socially-conservative and openly fascist Norsefire party led a reactionary purge to restore order; so-called enemies of the state disappeared during the night. The country was deeply divided over the loss of freedom until a [[bioterrorism|bioterrorist]] attack occurred, killing about 100,000 people (80,000 to be exact according to an article Finch is seen reading on his office computer). The fear generated by the attack allowed Norsefire to silence all opposition and win the next election by a landslide. A cure for the virus was discovered soon afterwards. With the silent consent of the people, Norsefire turned Britain into a bigoted totalitarian republic, with their leader Adam Sutler as High Chancellor.

From this revelation, the inspector predicts the chain of coming events. Narrated by him, he explains the brilliance of V's plan. His manipulation, hidden agenda, and finally the shipping out hundreds of thousands of Guy Fawkes masks to homes throughout Britain. The following scenes show a hold up in a store by a man in a Guy Fawkes mask, who yells "[[Anarchy in the U.K.]]" a reference to the [[Sex Pistols]] song as well as to the V of the comic book who thought himself more of an anarchist than a freedom fighter. Another shows a young girl playing in a mask, who is shot by a government agent. As angry citizens surround the agent and assault him regardless of his badge and gun, this event symbolizes the growing rebellion. 

However, the viral catastrophe had actually been engineered by Norsefire as a plot to gain power. The virus had been engineered through deadly experimentation on "social deviants" and political dissidents at [[Larkhill]] detention centre. V had been one of the prisoners, but instead of being killed by the experiments, he had gained heightened mental and physical abilities. V eventually destroyed the centre and escaped, vowing to take revenge on Norsefire's regime.

As November the fifth nears, V's various schemes cause chaos in Britain and the population grows more and more intolerant and [[Subversion (political)|subversive]] towards government authority. On the eve of November 5, Evey again visits V, who shows her a train that he has filled with explosives in order to destroy Parliament through an explosion in the abandoned [[London Underground]]. He delegates the destruction of Parliament to Evey, believing that the ultimate decision should not come from him. He then leaves to meet Party leader Creedy, who, as part of an earlier agreement, has agreed to bring V the Chancellor in exchange for V's surrender. Creedy kills the Chancellor in front of V, but V does not surrender. He takes a barrage of bullets from a dozen men, and remains standing thanks to a hidden armour plate he is wearing. He then proceeds to kill Creedy and his men before they can reload and with his hand around Creedy's neck just like he promised them. V, mortally wounded in the fight, returns to Evey. He confesses his love to her, thanks her, and then dies. His body is placed upon the train with the explosives.

Evey is about to send the train down the track, when she is discovered by Inspector Finch. However, Finch, having learned much about the corruption of the Norsefire regime, allows Evey to proceed. Meanwhile, thousands of Londoners, all wearing [[Guy Fawkes]] masks, march on Parliament to watch the event. Because Creedy and the Chancellor are dead, the military stands down in the face of a civil rebellion. Parliament is destroyed by the explosion. On a nearby rooftop Evey and Finch watch the scene together, and Finch asks who V was. Evey answers by saying that he is all the people of Britain. The camera shows the crowd again as they remove their Guy Fawkes masks and reveal characters from the film, including deceased characters such as the young girl, Gordon, Valerie and Ruth.

* '''[[Stephen Rea]]''' as '''[[Eric Finch|Chief Inspector Eric Finch]]''': Finch is the lead inspector in the V investigation, who, during his investigation, uncovers an unspeakable government crime. Rea is no stranger to politics and terrorism, as he was once married to [[Dolours Price]], a former member of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]], imprisoned for bombing the [[Old Bailey]]. When asked whether the politics attracted him to the film, Rea replied "Well, I don<U+2019>t think it would be very interesting if it was just comic-book stuff." "The politics of it are what gives it its dimension and momentum, and of course I was interested in the politics.

* '''[[Sinead Cusack]]''' as '''Dr. Delia Surridge''': Dr. Surridge was the head physician at the Larkhill detention centre. V states that the torture and death at Larkhill was only possible because of her research. Surridge, unlike the other victims of V, proves to have a [[conscience]] and feels guilty about the crimes she committed, this may explain why V gave her a painless poison, rather than a drug overdose like his other victims.
* '''[[John Standing]]''' as '''Bishop Anthony James Lilliman''': Lilliman is a corrupt [[paedophile]] bishop at [[Westminster Abbey]], installed into this position by Sutler. Lilliman was a Reverend at the Larkhill center. He was warned by Evey Hammond when she was undercover as a prostitute. He was wounded by V and was killed by a drug overdose.

He oversees random audio sweeps and massive surveillance vans. He gives several reports to Sutler. His fate is unknown but he was either killed or imprisoned when Norsefire collapsed.

==Development==
The film was made by many of the same filmmakers involved in [[The Matrix series|the ''Matrix'' trilogy]]. In 1988, producer Joel Silver acquired the rights to two of [[Alan Moore]]'s works: ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' and ''[[Watchmen]]''.<ref name="vendettasite">{{cite web | title=V for Vendetta news | publisher=Warner Brothers | work=vforvendetta.com | url=http://vforvendetta.warnerbros.com/index2.html | accessmonthday=31 March |accessyear=2006}}</ref> The Wachowskis were fans of ''V for Vendetta'' and in the mid-1990s, before working on ''[[The Matrix]]'', wrote a draft screenplay that closely followed the graphic novel. During the post-production of the second and third ''Matrix'' films, they revisited the screenplay and offered the director's role to [[James McTeigue]]. All three were intrigued by the themes of the original story and found them to be relevant to the current political landscape. Upon revisiting the screenplay, the Wachowskis set about making revisions to condense and modernize the story, while at the same time attempting to preserve its integrity and themes.<ref name="official production">{{cite web | title=Production Notes for V for Vendetta | work=official webpage | publisher=vforvendetta.com | url=http://vforvendetta.warnerbros.com/cmp/prod_notes_ch_02.html | accessmonthday=14 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref> James McTeigue cites the film ''[[The Battle of Algiers (film)|The Battle of Algiers]]'' as his principal influence in preparing to film ''V for Vendetta''.<ref name="official production" />

Moore explicitly disassociated himself from the film due to his lack of involvement in its writing or directing, as well as due to a continuing series of disputes over film adaptations of his work.<ref name="IGN">{{cite news |last=Goldstein |first=Hilary |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/696/696867p1.html |title=V for Vendetta: Comic vs. Film |publisher=IGN.com |date=2006-03-17 |accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref> He ended cooperation with his publisher, [[DC Comics]], after its corporate parent, [[Warner Bros.]], failed to retract statements about Moore's supposed endorsement of the film. Moore said that the script contained plot holes<ref name="comicbookresource">{{cite news |last=Johnston |first=Rich |url=http://comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?column=litg&article=2153 |title=MOORE SLAMS V FOR VENDETTA MOVIE, PULLS LoEG FROM DC COMICS |publisher=comicbookresources.com |date=2005-05-23 |accessdate=2006-01-03}}</ref> and that it ran contrary to the theme of his original work, which was to place two political extremes ([[fascism]] and [[anarchism]]) against one another. He argues his work had been recast as a story about "current [[neoconservatism|American neo-conservatism]] vs. current [[American liberalism]]".<ref name="mooreinterview">{{cite news |last=MacDonald |first=Heidi |url=http://www.comicon.com/thebeat/2006/03/a_for_alan_pt_1_the_alan_moore.html |title=A FOR ALAN, Pt. 1: The Alan Moore interview |publisher=GIANT Magazine |date=2006-03-15 |accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref> As per his wishes, Moore's name does not appear in the film's closing credits. Co-creator and illustrator [[David Lloyd (comic artist)|David Lloyd]] supports the film adaptation, commenting that the script is very good and that Moore would only ever be truly happy with a complete book-to-screen adaptation.<ref name="vendettasite"/>

==Production==
''V for Vendetta'' was filmed in London, [[United Kingdom|UK]], and in [[Potsdam]], [[Germany]], at [[Babelsberg Studios]]. Much of the film was shot on [[sound stage]]s and indoor sets, with location work done in [[Berlin]] for three scenes: the Norsefire rally flashback, Larkhill, and Bishop Lilliman's bedroom. The scenes that took place in the abandoned [[London Underground]] were filmed at the disused [[Aldwych tube station]]. Filming began in early March 2005 and principal photography officially wrapped in early June 2005.<ref name="vendettasite"/> ''V for Vendetta'' is the final film shot by [[cinematographer]] [[Adrian Biddle]], who died of a heart attack on [[December 7]], [[2005]].

The film was designed to have a future-retro look, with a heavy use of grey tones to give a dreary, stagnant feel to totalitarian London. The largest set created for the film was the Shadow Gallery, which was made to feel like a cross between a crypt and an [[undercroft]].<ref name="Unmasked">{{cite visual | crew=Warner Bros | date=2006 | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0775408 | title=V for Vendetta Unmasked | medium=TV-Special | location=United States|distributor=Warner Bros.}}</ref> The Gallery is V's home as well as the place where he stores various artifacts forbidden by the government. Some of the works of art displayed in the gallery include ''[[The Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' by [[Titian]], a ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' poster, ''[[St. Sebastian (Mantegna)| St. Sebastian]]'' by [[Andrea Mantegna]], and ''[[The Lady of Shalott]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]].

One of the major challenges in the film was how to bring V to life from under an expressionless mask. Thus, considerable effort was made to bring together lighting, acting, and Weaving's voice to create the proper mood for the situation. In order to prevent the mask from muffling Weaving's voice, a microphone was placed in his hairline to aid post-production, when his entire dialogue was re-recorded.<ref name="About the Production">{{cite web | work=Official Website | title=V for Vendetta - About the production | url=http://vforvendetta.warnerbros.com/cmp/prod_notes_ch_03.html | accessmonthday=4 January | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

To film the final scene at [[Westminster]], the area from [[Trafalgar Square]] and [[Whitehall]] up to Parliament and [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]] had to be closed for three nights from midnight until 5 a.m. This was the first time the security-sensitive area (home to [[10 Downing Street]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]) had ever been closed to accommodate filming.<ref name="About the Production" /> Prime Minister (at the time of filming) [[Tony Blair]]'s son [[Euan Blair]] worked on the film's production and is said (according to an interview with Stephen Fry) to have helped the filmmakers obtain the unparalleled filming access. This drew criticism of Blair from [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] due to the content of the film. However, the makers of the film denied Euan Blair's involvement in the deal,<ref name="tony blair's son">{{cite web | publisher=The Guardian | title=How E got the V in Vendetta | url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1737806,00.html | date=March 23, 2006 | accessmonthday=13 May | accessyear=2006}}</ref> stating that access was acquired through nine months of negotiations with 14 different government departments and agencies.<ref name="About the Production" />

==Publicity and release==
[[Image:Natalie Portman at Comic Con5 2005b.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Natalie Portman speaking at the 2005 [[Comic-Con|San Diego Comic-Con]].]]
The cast and film-makers attended several press conferences that allowed them to address issues surrounding the film, including its authenticity, Alan Moore's reaction to it and its intended political message. The responses given at the conferences{{Fact|date=April 2007}} made it clear that the film was intended to be a departure from some of Moore's original themes. In the words of Hugo Weaving: "Alan Moore was writing about something which happened some time ago. It was a response to living in [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcherite]] England... This is a response to the world in which we live today. So I think that the film and the graphic novel are two separate entities." Regarding the controversial political content in the film the filmmakers have said that the film is intended more to raise questions and add to a dialogue already present in society, rather than provide answers or tell viewers what to think.<ref name="v for vendetta interviews"/>

The film takes extensive imagery from the 1605 [[Gunpowder Plot]], where a group of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] conspirators plotted to destroy the Houses of Parliament in order to spark a revolution in England.<ref name="vendettasite"/> The film was originally scheduled for release on the weekend of [[November 5]], [[2005]], the 400th anniversary of the Plot, with the tag line "Remember, remember the 5th of November", taken from a traditional British rhyme memorialising the event. However, the marketing angle lost much of its value when the release date was pushed back to [[March 17]], [[2006]]. Many have speculated that the delay was due to the London tube bombing on [[7 July 2005 London bombings|July 7]] and the failed [[21 July 2005 London bombings|July 21 bombing]].<ref>[http://www.scifi.com/sfw/column/sfw12459.html/ C Is for Controversy | Columns | SCI FI Weekly<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The film-makers have denied this, saying that the delays were from the need for more time in order to finish the visual effects production.<ref name="Postponed">{{cite web | publisher=sfgate.com | title=Natalie Portman's 'V for Vendetta' Postponed | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=7&entry_id=452 | accessmonthday=25 April |accessyear=2006}}</ref> ''V for Vendetta'' had its first major premiere on [[February 13]] at the [[Berlin Film Festival]].<ref name="v for vendetta interviews"/> It opened for general release on [[March 17]], [[2006]] in 3,365 theatres in the [[United States]], the United Kingdom and six other countries.<ref name="boxofficemojo"/>

==Music==
{{main | V for Vendetta (soundtrack)}}
The ''V for Vendetta'' [[film soundtrack|soundtrack]] was released by [[Astralwerks|Astralwerks Records]] on [[March 21]], [[2006]]. The original scores from the film's composer, [[Dario Marianelli]], make up most of the tracks on the album. The soundtrack also features three vocals played during the film: "[[Cry Me a River]]" by [[Julie London]], a cover of [[The Velvet Underground]] song, "[[I Found a Reason]]" by [[Cat Power]] and "Bird Gerhl" by [[Antony and the Johnsons]]. As mentioned in the film, these songs are samples of the 872 [[Blacklisted#Political context|blacklisted]] tracks on V's [[Wurlitzer|Wurlitzer jukebox]] that V "reclaimed" from the Ministry of Objectionable Materials. The climax of [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[1812 Overture]]'' appears at the end of the track "Knives and Bullets (and Cannons too)". The Overture is played at key parts at the beginning and end of the film.

Three songs were played during the ending credits which were not included on the ''V for Vendetta'' soundtrack. The first was "[[Street Fighting Man]]" by [[The Rolling Stones]]. The second was a special version of [[Ethan Stoller]]'s "BKAB". In keeping with revolutionary tone of the film, excerpts from "On Black Power" by [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] leader [[Malcolm X]], and from "Address to the Women of America" by feminist-writer [[Gloria Steinem]] were added to the song. Gloria Steinem can be heard saying: "This is no simple reform... It really is a revolution. Sex and race, because they are easy and visible differences, have been the primary ways of organizing human beings into superior and inferior groups and into the cheap labour on which this system still depends." The final song was "Out of Sight" by [[Spiritualized]].

Also in the film were segments from two of [[Antonio Carlos Jobim]]'s classic [[bossa nova]] songs, "[[The Girl from Ipanema|The Girl From Ipanema]]" and "[[Corcovado (Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars)|Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars]]". These songs were played during the "breakfast scenes" with V and Deitrich and were one of the ways used to tie the two characters together. [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's ''Symphony No.5'']] also plays an important role in the film, with the first four notes of the song signifying the letter "V" in [[Morse code]].<ref name= "Graphic Novel">{{cite book |last= Moore |first= Alan |coauthors= David Lloyd |title= [[V for Vendetta]] |quote=Inspector Finch recognizes the background noise as Beethoven's Fifth, and states: "It's Morse code for the letter "V"" |publisher= [[DC Comics]] |year= 2005 |month= November |isbn= 1401207928 }}</ref><ref name="BBC News">{{cite web | work=news.bbc.co.uk | title=Newswatch 1940s | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/newswatch/history/noflash/html/1940s.stm | accessdate=21 Nov|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Gordon Deitrich's [[Benny Hill]]-styled comedy sketch of Chancellor Sutler includes the "[[Yakety Sax]]" theme.

''V for Vendetta'' sets the Gunpowder Plot as V<U+2019>s historical inspiration, contributing to his choice of timing, language and appearance.<ref name="official production"/> For example, the names [[Ambrose Rokewood|Rokewood]], [[Thomas Percy (plotter)|Percy]] and [[Robert Keyes|Keyes]] are used in the film, which are also the names of three of the Gunpowder conspirators. The film creates parallels to [[Alexandre Dumas, p<U+00E8>re|Alexandre Dumas']] ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', by drawing direct comparisons between V and [[Edmond Dant<U+00E8>s]].

According to the Official Website, "V<U+2019>s use of the Guy Fawkes mask and persona functions as both practical and symbolic elements of the story. He wears the mask to hide his physical scars, and in obscuring his identity, V becomes more than just a man with a revolutionary idea <U+2013> he becomes the idea itself":<ref name="official production"/>

[[Image:VforVendettaNorsefire.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Norsefire regime takes totalitarian imagery from many sources, fictional and non-fictional.]]
As a film about the struggle between freedom and the state, ''V for Vendetta'' takes imagery from many classic totalitarian icons both real and fictional, including [[Nazi Germany]] and [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[1984 (book)|1984]]''.<ref name="official production"/><ref name="v for vendetta interviews"/> For example, Adam Sutler (whose name evokes that of [[Adolf Hitler]])<ref name="v for vendetta interviews"/> primarily appears on large video screens and on portraits in people's homes, reminiscent of [[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]]. In another reference to Orwell's novel, the slogan "Strength through Unity. Unity through Faith" is displayed prominently across London, similar in cadence to "[[Ministry of Truth|War is peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength]]" in Orwell's [[Oceania (1984)|Oceania]].<ref name="LaTimes">{{cite web|last=Chocano |first=Carina |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/cl-et-vendetta17mar17,1,1139774.story?coll=la-promo-entnews |title='V for Vendetta'|accessmonthday=17 March |accessyear=2006 }}</ref> There is also the state's use of [[mass surveillance]], such as [[closed-circuit television]], on its citizens.

Norsefire has replaced [[St George's Cross]] with the [[Cross of Lorraine]] as their Nordic-style national symbol. This was a symbol used by [[Free French Forces]] during World War II, as it was a traditional symbol of French patriotism that could be used as an answer to the [[Swastika#Nazi Germany|Nazis' Swastika]]. The media is also portrayed as highly subservient to government propaganda, a characteristic of totalitarian regimes in general.

===Modern fears of totalitarianism===
{{quotation|We felt the novel was very prescient to how the political climate is at the moment. It really showed what can happen when society is ruled by government, rather than the government being run as a voice of the people. I don't think it<U+2019>s such a big leap to say that things like that can happen when leaders stop listening to the people.|Director James McTeigue<ref name="official production" />}}

With the intention of modernizing the film, the filmmakers added topical references relevant to a 2006 audience. According to the [[Los Angeles Times]], "With a wealth of new, real-life parallels to draw from in the areas of government surveillance, torture, [[Fear Mongering|fear-mongering]] and [[media manipulation]], not to mention [[corporate corruption]] and religious hypocrisy, you can't really blame the filmmakers for having a field day referencing current events." There are also references to an [[Global spread of H5N1|avian flu]] pandemic, as well as pervasive use of [[Biometrics|biometric identification]] and [[ECHELON|signal-intelligence gathering]] and analysis by the regime.<ref name="LaTimes"/>

Many film critics, political commentators and other members of the media have also noted the numerous references in the film to events surrounding the current [[George W. Bush administration|American administration]]. These include the "black bags" worn by the prisoners in Larkhill that have been seen as a reference to the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|black bags]] worn by prisoners at [[Abu Ghraib prison|Abu Ghraib]] in Iraq and in U.S.-administered [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]] in  Cuba, though the pre-Matrix draft of the screenplay also contains this reference to black bags.<ref name="The Age">{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/03/16/1142098594274.html |title=Gunpowder, treason and plot|work=The Age|publisher=Fairfax Digital |accessmonthday=19 March |accessyear=2006 }}</ref>

Bush]]. Finally, the film contains references to "America's war" and "the war America started" as well as real footage from the [[Iraq War]].

Despite the American specific references, the filmmakers have always referred to the film as adding dialogue to a set of issues much broader than the U.S. administration.<ref name="v for vendetta interviews"/> When James McTeigue was asked whether or not BTN was based on [[Fox News Channel controversies and allegations of bias|Fox News]] McTeigue replied, "Yes.

===The letter V and the number 5===

This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the ''[[vox populi]]'', now vacant and vanished.

The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it's my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V. | V's introduction to Evey}}

[[Image:VdaggersVforVendetta.JPG|300px|thumb|right|In his battle with Creedy, V primes his daggers into the letter "V" before throwing them.]]
Similar to the graphic novel, there is repeated reference to the letter "V" and the number five throughout the film ("V" is the [[roman numerals|roman numeral]] for "5"). <ref name="annotation">{{cite news |last=Boudreaux |first=Madelyn |url=http://www.enjolrasworld.com/Annotations/Alan%20Moore/V%20for%20Vendetta/V%20for%20Vendetta%20Revised%20-%20Complete.html |title=An Annotation of Literary, Historic, and Artistic References in Alan Moore's Graphic Novel, V for Vendetta |publisher=Madelyn Boudreaux |date=2004-08-13 |accessdate=2007-01-04}}</ref>  For example, V's introduction to Evey is a monologue containing 49 words beginning with the letter "V" (50 V's including the one he draws on the wall, and 53 V's in the entire monologue, with V and the V on the wall making 55). V also finds it appropriate that this person that he has just met is named Evey, which could be interpreted as E-V, with E being the fifth letter of the alphabet.  With implicit and explicit references to [[Guy Fawkes]] Day, "V" echoes the fifth of November 1605.  During his imprisonment at Larkhill, V was held in cell number "V". V's [[Zorro]]-like signature is also the letter "V". Before the destruction of the Old Bailey, the bell which is ringing out, presumably Big Ben, tolls 5 times before the music intervenes and the explosion commences. During said explosion involving the Old Bailey, the fireworks form a red V configuration, completed by a circular firework, thus resembling not only V but the V for Vendetta logo.  It is revealed that V's personal motto is "By the power of truth, I, while living, have conquered the universe", which according to the film translates into the 4 "V"ed [[Latin]] phrase: ''"[[Vi veri universum vivus vici|Vi Veri universum Vivus Vici]]"''. However the ancient Romans wrote the letter 'U' as 'V' just like they write 'J' as 'I'. Therefore, if his motto is written as the Romans would have done, all 5 words start with V. In a dance with Evey, the song V chooses is number five on his jukebox (although every song in his jukebox is number 5). When V confronts Creedy in his home, he plays [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]], whose opening notes have a rhythmic pattern that resembles the letter "V" in [[Morse code]]('''<U+00B7><U+00B7><U+00B7><U+2013>''').<ref name= "Graphic Novel"/><ref name="BBC News"/> The film<U+2019>s title itself is a reference to "V for Victory"<ref name="Dez Skinn">{{cite news | last=Skinn | first=Dez| work=qualitycommunications.com | title=CI #181: Special Web Preview of V FOR VENDETTA | url=http://www.qualitycommunications.co.uk/ci/preview181.htm |accessdate=2007-01-04 }}</ref><ref name="inside cover">{{cite book |last= Moore |first= Alan |coauthors= David Lloyd |title= [[V for Vendetta]] |publisher= [[DC Comics]] |pages = Inside Cover |year= 2005 |month= November |isbn= 1401207928 }}</ref>, the fifth symphony and the painting over Nazi posters with the V (as happens with Norsefire posters in the film) were both part of the [[V sign#Winston Churchill and the victory sign| Campaign]]. As V waits for night to fall, he arranges a complex domino pattern in black and red which forms the V logo.  In the battle with Creedy and his men at [[Victoria station (London)|Victoria station]], V forms a "V" with his daggers just before he throws them. As they fly through the air, they form the letter "V" five times before hitting their targets, who are standing in a "V" formation. After the battle, when V is mortally wounded, he leaves a "V" signature in his own blood.  After V battles Creedy the clock strikes 11:05 forming a "V", another Guy Fawkes reference given that the 11th month is November, and the 5 obviously being the fifth day. The destruction of Parliament results in a display of fireworks which form the letter "V", which is also an inverted [[Anarcho-punk#The DIY punk ethic|red-on-black "A" symbol]] for anarchy.<ref name="lewrockwell.com">{{cite web | work=lewrockwell.com | title=A for Anarchy, E for Execution | url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/chu/chu14.html | accessdate=21 Nov | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

===Comments from political sources===
''V for Vendetta'' deals with issues of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[religion]], [[totalitarianism]], and [[terrorism]]. Its controversial story line and themes have, inevitably, made it the target of both criticism and praise from [[sociopolitical]] groups.

Several [[anarchist]] groups have rejected the film, while others have used it as a means to promote anarchism as a political philosophy. On [[April 17]], [[2006]] the [[NYMAA|New York Metro Alliance of Anarchists (NYMAA)]] protested [[DC Comics]] and [[Time Warner]], accusing it of watering down the story<U+2019>s original message in favour of violence and special effects.<ref name="Columbia">{{cite news |last= Launder |first= William |url= http://jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2006-05-02/launder-anarchistfight |title= "V" stands for very bad anarchist movie|publisher=Columbia News Service |date=2006-05-02 |accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref><ref name="NYMAA">{{cite news |last= Inducer |first= Smile |url= http://nymaa.org/node/243 |title= V for Vendetta? A For Anarchy!|publisher=NYMAA |date=2006-09-28 |accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref> [[David Graeber]], an anarchist scholar and former professor at [[Yale University]], was not upset by the film. "I thought the message of anarchy got out in spite of Hollywood." However, Graeber went on to state: "Anarchy is about creating communities and democratic decision making. That<U+2019>s what is absent from Hollywood<U+2019>s interpretation."<ref name="Columbia"/>

Despite the lack of acceptance by some anarchists, the film has brought renewed interest to Alan Moore's original story, as sales of the original graphic novel rose dramatically in the United States.<ref name="Televisionpoint">{{cite web | work=televisionpoint.com | title=V for Vendetta Graphic Novel is a US Bestseller | url=http://www.televisionpoint.com/news2006/newsfullstory.php?id=1143785410 | accessmonthday=2 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref> According to [[Publishers Weekly]], by end of the March 2006 ''V for Vendetta'' was the number one graphic novel and number four fiction trade paperback at [[Barnes & Noble]] and was the number one graphic novel and the number three book on the overall bestseller list at [[Amazon.com]].<ref name="Publishers Weekly">{{cite news |last=Reid |first=Calvin |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6321550.html |title=B Is for Big Book Sales |publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=2006-04-04 |accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref>

Several [[libertarianism|libertarians]], including members from the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute|Mises Institute's]] [[LewRockwell.com]], see the film as a positive depiction in favour of a free society with limited government and free enterprise.

==Differences between the film and graphic novel==
:''For more information, see [[V for Vendetta]].''
The film's story was adapted from an Alan Moore comic originally published between 1982 and 1985 in the British comic anthology ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', and then reprinted and completed by DC. These comics were later compiled into a graphic novel and published again in the United States under DC's [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] imprint and in the United Kingdom under [[Titan Books]].
[[Image:Vendetta8comiccover.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Alan Moore's original story is darker, with a greater emphasis on anarchist themes.]]
There are several fundamental differences between the film and the original source material. For example, Alan Moore's original story was created as a response to British [[Thatcherism]] in the early 80s and was set as a conflict between a [[fascist]] state and anarchism, whereas the film's story has been changed by the Wachowskis to fit a modern political context.<ref name="mooreinterview"/> Alan Moore charges that in doing so, the story has turned into an American-centric conflict between [[liberalism (US)|liberalism]] and [[neo-conservatism]], and abandons the original anarchist-fascist themes. Moore states, "There wasn't a mention of anarchy as far as I could see. The fascism had been completely defanged. I mean, I think that any references to [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial purity]] had been excised, whereas actually, fascists are quite big on racial purity."<ref name="mooreinterview"/>  Furthermore, in the original story, Moore attempted to maintain moral ambiguity, and not to portray the fascists as caricatures, but as realistic, rounded characters.<ref name="mooreinterview"/> The time limitations of a film meant that the story had to omit or streamline some of the characters, details, and plotlines from the original story.<ref name="official production"/> Chiefly, whereas the original graphic novel has the fascists elected legally and kept in power through the general apathy of the public, the film introduces the "St. Mary's virus," a biological weapon engineered and released by the Norsefire party as a means of clandestinely gaining control over their own country.

Many of the characters from the graphic novel underwent significant changes for the film. For example, V is characterized in the film as a romantic freedom fighter who shows concern over the loss of innocent life. However, in the graphic novel, he is portrayed as ruthless, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way.{{Fact|date=November 2007}} Evey Hammond's transformation as V's [[Mentorship|prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>]] is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film. At the beginning of the film, she is already a confident woman with a hint of rebellion in her, whereas in the graphic novel she starts off as an insecure, desperate young woman forced into [[prostitution]]. In the end, she not only carries out V's plans as she does in the film, but also clearly takes on V's identity.<ref name="IGN"/> Whereas in the film Inspector Finch sympathizes with V, in the graphic novel he is determined to stop V and goes as far as taking [[LSD]] in order to enter into a criminal's state of mind.<ref name="IGN"/> Characters who were completely omitted from the film or had a significantly reduced role include Rose Almond, Alistair Harper, and Mrs. Heyer.

The graphic novel's main villains also underwent changes in the film adaptation. While the Chancellor within Moore's text is a brutal dictator, he is also a lonely, socially inept man who truly believes in fascism, and, in the end, wishes merely to be accepted and loved by his people. The film, however, presents none of these human qualities. Creedy, meanwhile, evolves from a relatively minor character in the graphic novel to one of the chief characters of the film adaptation; in the film, he is revealed to have been the brains behind the bioterror attack that Norsefire used to seize power. His personality is also somewhat revamped in the film; whereas he is a coarse, petty opportunist in the graphic novel, in the film he is an icy [[sociopath]] whom V calls "a man seemingly without a [[conscience]], for whom [[the ends justify the means|the ends always justify the means]]."

The setting and plot of the film were also changed from the original story. Whereas the film only mentions the United States' civil war and collapse, in the graphic novel, it is mentioned that a global [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] has destroyed much of the world outside of Britain. With a [[nuclear winter]] causing famine and massive flooding, there is a real fear that a collapse of the Norsefire government would lead to disaster. Whereas the film ends in a relatively peaceful overthrow, in the graphic novel there is a violent collapse of authority. Other differences include the computer system "Fate", which is completely missing from the film. (In the original story, Fate was a Big Brother-like computer which served as Norsefire's eyes and ears and also helped explain how V could see and hear the things he did.) V's terrorist targets are also different in the graphic novel, as he destroys Parliament and the Old Bailey in the beginning, and destroys [[10 Downing Street]] for the finale.

== DVD and high definition releases ==
''V for Vendetta'' was released on DVD in the US on [[August 1]], [[2006]] in three formats: a single-disc wide-screen version, a single-disc full-screen version, and a two-disc [[Widescreen|wide-screen]] special edition. The single disc versions contain a short (15:56) behind-the-scenes [[featurette]] titled "Freedom! Forever! Making V for Vendetta" and the film's [[theatrical trailer]], whereas the two-disc special edition contains three additional documentaries, and several extra features for collectors. On the second disc of the special edition, a short [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] clip of Natalie Portman on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' can be viewed by selecting the picture of wings on the second page of the menu. The film has also been released on the [[HD DVD]] [[High-definition video|high definition]] format, which features a unique 'in-movie experience' created exclusively for the disc. Warner Bros. announced on [[February 8]], [[2008]] that V for Vendetta will be released on [[Blu-Ray]] some time in 2008.

== Tie-ins ==
===Books===
The Moore/Lloyd graphic novel was re-released as a hardback collection in October 2005 to tie into the film's release (originally November 5, 2005). ''(Moore was reportedly furious to notice that the true first printing was marred by a spelling mistake on the back cover, and unceremoniously disposed of his complimentary copies.)''
*[[Alan Moore|Moore, Alan]] & [[David Lloyd (comic artist)|Lloyd, David]], ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' ([[Vertigo Comics]], October 12, 2005) ISBN 1401207928

A novelisation of the film was written by [[Steve Moore (comics)|Steve Moore]] (although the two Moores are often linked, they are not related), based on the Wachowski Brothers' script and released in January, 2006.
*[[Steve Moore (comics)|Moore, Steve]], ''V for Vendetta'' (Pocket Star, Jan 31, 2006) ISBN 1416516999

A behind-the-scenes book was written by Wachowski-collaborator Spencer Lamm (Lamm produced much of the content of [http://www.whatisthematrix.com TheMatrix.com]; edited ''The Art of The Matrix'' and volumes of [[The Matrix]] comics, and is also involved in the Brothers' [[Burlyman Entertainment]] comics venture) and published in August, 2006.
*Lamm, Spencer, ''V for Vendetta: From Script to Film'' (Universe, August 22, 2006) ISBN 0789315033

===CDs===
A soundtrack CD featuring music from the film was released by Astralwerks on Mar 21, 2006. Alongside [[Dario Marianelli]]'s score are songs by [[Julie London]], [[Cat Power]] and [[Antony & the Johnsons]]. The final track (by Marianelli) - "Knives and Bullets (and Cannons Too)" - incorporates the pivotal piece of music from the film: [[Tchaikovsky]]'s [[1812 Overture]].

[[David J]] (of [[Bauhaus]] fame)'s 1983 'soundtrack' to the [[V for Vendetta]] ''comic'' was re-released to tie-into the film, on June 13, 2006. Moore approached David J for help with setting "The Vicious Cabaret" (an episode of the comic which takes the form of a fully-scored musical piece) to music. J also wrote other musical pieces inspired by the comic series.

===Other===
As well as promotional items created to publicise the film (which included a shoulder bag and bust of the Guy Fawkes - 'V' -mask), replicas of the mask and action figures were released. Figures (released by NECA) include a 12" action figure which speaks phrases from the film, a 12" resin statue and a 7" figure.

(Semi-)Official V costumes have been created for [[Halloween]]. These range from the 'full' costume (cape, hat, mask and dagger-belt) to various individual aspects - gloves, hat, mask, hair, daggers, etc. - which are available both separately and in combinations.
