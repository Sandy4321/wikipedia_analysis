The '''Puerto Rican Amazon''' (''Amazona vittata''), also known as the '''Puerto Rican Parrot''' or '''''Iguaca''''', is a bird [[Endemism in birds|endemic]] to the [[archipelago]] of [[Puerto Rico]] belonging to the [[Neotropic ecozone|Neotropical]] genus ''[[Amazon parrot|Amazona]]''. Measuring 28&ndash;30&nbsp;cm (11&ndash;12&nbsp;in), the Puerto Rican Amazon is a predominantly green [[parrot]] with a red forehead and white rings around the eyes. Two subspecies have been described, although there are doubts regarding the distinctiveness of the form ''gracilipes'' from [[Culebra, Puerto Rico|Culebra Island]], extinct since 1912. Its closest relatives are believed to be the [[Cuban Amazon]] (''Amazona leucocephala'') and the [[Hispaniolan Amazon]] (''Amazona ventralis'').

The Puerto Rican Amazon reaches sexual maturity between three and four years of age. It reproduces once a year and is a [[Bird nest#Cavity|cavity nester]]. Once the female lays eggs she will remain in the nest and continuously incubate them until hatching. The chicks are fed by both parents and will [[fledge]] 60 to 65 days after hatching. This parrot's diet is varied and consists of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar obtained from the forest [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]].

The species is the only remaining native parrot in Puerto Rico and has been listed as [[critically endangered]] by the [[World Conservation Union]] since 1994. Initially widespread and abundant, the population declined drastically in the 19th and early 20th centuries with the removal of most of its native habitat; the species completely vanished from [[Vieques, Puerto Rico|Vieques]] and [[Mona, Puerto Rico|Mona Island]], nearby to the main island of Puerto Rico. Conservation efforts commenced in 1968 to save the bird from extinction. In 2006, the total estimated population was 34 to 40 individuals in the wild and 143 individuals in captivity.<ref name="Q & A"/>

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The Puerto Rican Amazon was described by Dutch ornithologist [[Pieter Boddaert]] in 1783. It belongs to the large [[Neotropic ecozone|Neotropical]] genus ''Amazona'', commonly known as [[Amazon parrot|amazons]]; these birds have also been given the generic epithet of 'parrot' by the [[American Ornithologists' Union]], hence Puerto Rican Parrot is an alternative common name in North America.<ref name=aud06/> The indigenous [[Ta<U+00ED>no]] people called it the ''Iguaca'', an [[onomatopoeic]] name that resembled the parrots' flight call.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/southeast/news/2000/r00-026.html |title=Captive-bred Puerto Rican Parrots released in El Yunque |accessdate=2008-06-02 |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |date=[[2000-06-28]]}}</ref>

There are two recognized subspecies:
*'''''A. v. vittata''''' is the [[Subspecies#Nomenclature|nominate]] and only extant subspecies, inhabiting Puerto Rico and formerly nearby [[Vieques, Puerto Rico|Vieques Island]] and [[Mona, Puerto Rico|Mona Island]].<ref name = CMI>{{Cite web|publisher=Conservation Management Institute| title=Taxonomy: Puerto Rican Parrot|url=http://fwie.fw.vt.edu/WWW/esis/lists/e104004.htm|accessdate=2008-06-18}}</ref>
*'''''A. v. gracilipes''''' inhabited [[Culebra, Puerto Rico|Culebra Island]] and is now extinct. It is unclear whether it was substantially different from the nominate subspecies ''vittata''.

===Evolutionary history===
There is no evidence that the West Indies were connected to a continent in the past, and thus the various native bird species are assumed to be descended from those that immigrated to the [[Caribbean]] at some point. Some small species would have encountered problems traversing large bodies of water, but parrots have flight strength and various behavioral characteristics that would facilitate "over-water" dispersion.<ref name="p.42">Snyder ''et al.'', p. 42</ref> Most Caribbean bird species originate from [[Central America|Central]], [[North America|North]] and [[South America]].<ref name="p.44">Snyder ''et al.'', p. 44</ref> The ''[[Amazon parrot|Amazona]]'' species found in the Caribbean are divided in two groups: five mid-sized species found in the [[Greater Antilles]] and seven large species in the [[Lesser Antilles]].<ref name="p.46">Snyder ''et al.'', p. 46</ref> All the Greater Antillean Amazons display characteristics leading to suppositions of relatedness, including predominantly green-toned color patterns and white rings around the eyes.<ref name="p.46"/> Russello and Amato conclude that all Greater Antillean ''Amazona'' descend from ''[[Amazona albifrons]]'' with ''Amazona vittata'', ''[[Amazona leucocephala]]'', and ''[[Amazona ventralis]]'' constituting a complex, a cluster of species so closely related that they intergrade.<ref>Russello and Amato, p. 433</ref>

British ornithologist [[David Lack]] considered that the Puerto Rican Amazon had evolved from the Hispaniolan Amazon (''A. ventralis'') found in [[Hispaniola]], but it has since been argued that he omitted some elements in his analysis, including the similarities found between the [[Black-billed Amazon]] (''A. agilis'') of [[Jamaica]] and the Puerto Rican Amazon.<ref name="p.47">Snyder ''et al.'', p. 47</ref> Subsequent studies showed that size and color patterns were not sufficient to assess evolutionary relationships, and that patterns changed with relative ease even within members of the same species.<ref name="p.47"/> The research concluded that the Puerto Rican Amazon may share a common ancestor with the Jamaican ''A. agilis''.<ref name="p.52">Snyder ''et al.'', p. 52</ref> Recent [[phylogenetic]] studies show that the Puerto Rican Amazon is more closely related to the Hispaniolan Amazon and the Cuban Amazon than to the Black-billed Amazon.<ref>Russello and Amato, p. 428</ref>

==Description==
The Puerto Rican Amazon measures {{convert|28|-|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} and weighs {{convert|250|-|300|g|oz|abbr=on}}, or {{convert|275|g|oz|abbr=on}} on average. Although small compared to Amazons in general, it is similar in size to other Greater Antilles ''Amazona'' species. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is not present. Both males and females have predominantly green plumage, though their feathers have blue edges. The [[Flight feather#primaries|primary flight feathers]] of the wings and the main [[Covert (feather)|covert]] feathers are dark blue. The color of the feathers on the underside varies depending on the body part: the feathers on the underside of the wings, which can be seen during flight, are bright blue; those in the tail have yellow-green tone. Their underparts are paler and yellow-tinged, their foreheads are red, and they have white ovals around the eyes. The iris is brown, the bill a horn color, and the legs yellow-tan.<ref name=Forshaw538>Forshaw and Cooper, p. 538</ref> Aside from DNA tests, males and females can only be distinguished by behavioral differences during the breeding season. Immature birds have plumage similar to adults.<ref name=Forshaw538/>

==Population and distribution==
The precise distribution of the Puerto Rican Amazon before the arrival of [[Spain|Spanish]] colonialists is uncertain, because of a lack of contemporary records and then the extermination of the indigenous Ta<U+00ED>no people, but the species was apparently widespread and abundant.<ref name="p.15">Snyder ''et al.'', p. 15</ref> There is also evidence the species may have inhabited other nearby islands, such as [[Antigua]], [[Barbuda]]<ref>{{Cite book|author=Charles A. Woods and Florence E. Sergile|title=Biogeography of the West Indies: Patterns and Perspectives |edition=2nd. ed. |location=Boca Raton |publisher=CRC |isbn= 0-8493200-1-1 |pages=p. 183}}</ref> and the [[Virgin Islands]].<ref name="Oberle">{{cite book|last= Oberle |first= Mark |year= 2003 |title= Las aves de Puerto Rico en fotograf<U+00ED>as |location= Washington |publisher= Humanitas |pages=13|isbn= 0-9650104-2-2 |language= Spanish}}</ref><ref name="p.18<U+2013>19">Snyder ''et al.'', pp. 18<U+2013>19</ref> Estimates of the parrot's early numbers vary greatly.

S. Fish and Wildlife Service |format=PDF| date=April 1999|accessdate=2008-06-18}}</ref> while others suggest a more modest population of 100,000. During the first 150 years of Spanish rule the human population was small, and in 1650, when the population of the island was 880 people<!--really?!?  including surviving natives?  wow, if so-->, the species was still abundant throughout the archipelago.<ref name="p.21<U+2013>22">Snyder ''et al.'', pp. 21<U+2013>22</ref> After 1650, human habitation increased exponentially, and by the 18th century the Puerto Rican Amazon population started to be affected.  Heinrich Moritz Gaede, a German naturalist, declared that by 1836 the parrot population had noticeably declined.<ref name="p.16"/> Even so, as late as 1864, British ornithologist Edward Cavendish Taylor noted that the parrots were still common near the island's capital, [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]].<ref name="p.16">Snyder ''et al.'', p. 16</ref> 

At first, human activity had not posed a significant threat to the Puerto Rican Amazon. The Ta<U+00ED>no hunted the parrot but without much effect on its population.<ref name="p.21">Snyder ''et al.'', p. 21</ref> In the past two hundred years, however, many factors have led to a drastic decrease in the birds' numbers: agricultural development, the construction of roads, hydroelectric development, and the adoption of young chicks as pets.<ref name="p.29<U+2013>36">Snyder ''et al.'', pp. 29<U+2013>36</ref> Especially during the latter half of the 19th century, most of Puerto Rico's virgin forests, a historical habitat of the species, were cleared for agricultural development, primarily for the production of sugar, cotton, corn and rice. The Amazon quickly came to rely on these crops as its main food source and so became seen as a pest; local farmers repelled or hunted the bird if possible.<ref name="p.22">Snyder ''et al.'', p. 22</ref> As agriculture expanded, the Amazon's habitat disappeared further and its population declined.

The species was historically found in mature or old-growth forests in Puerto Rico at all elevations, and in holes, cliffs, and other diverse habitats at lower elevations. The species could be found at medium elevations in the Guajataca State Forest (until 1910) and the Rio Abajo State Forest (until the 1920s), and at high elevations in the Carite State Forest (until the 1930s).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060104142436/http://www.fws.gov/endangered/i/b/sab02.html |title = Puerto Rican Parrot (''Amazona vittata'') - Species account|publisher = U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service| archived=2006-01-04| accessdate=2008-06-04}}</ref> Accounts from the early 1900s describe the parrots traveling away from the [[Luquillo]] forest and the Sierra de Cayey towards the main island's coast to find food.<ref name="p.15"/> At the same time, the species was extirpated from Puerto Rico's smaller islands<U+2014>Culebra, Vieques and Mona<U+2014>and became restricted to five locations: two in [[Karst topography|karst-limestone areas]], two in high montane rain forests and one in [[Mangrove|mangrove forest]] at the foot of the [[El Yunque National Forest]]. One of these karst regions, located in the northwestern part of Puerto Rico, was identified as a haven for the species. In particular, a region named ''Valle de las Cotorras'' ( Valley of the Parrots), located between [[San Sebasti<U+00E1>n, Puerto Rico|San Sebasti<U+00E1>n]] and [[Morovis, Puerto Rico|Morovis]], was home to a sizable population. Some Amazons survived in small pockets of degraded forest but these proved insufficient to support large colonies. Eventually their natural habitat was reduced to the [[Cordillera Central (Puerto Rico)|Cordillera Central]] and undisturbed forest areas, and by 1940 they were only to be found in primary forest at the Luquillo Mountains in the Caribbean National Forest. The species is currently found at elevations between 396 and 823&nbsp;m (1,300 and 2,700&nbsp;ft). Since the species requires mature forests with open-cavity trees for reproduction, it does not occur in dwarf and second growth forests. 

By the 1950s, there were only 200 parrots in the wild, and in 1975 the population reached an absolute low of 13 individuals. Numbers then recovered, and in August 1989 there were an estimated minimum of 47 individuals. But on [[September 18]], [[1989]], [[Hurricane Hugo]] struck the northeast coast of Puerto Rico inflicting heavy casualties on the remaining birds. In the aftermath of the hurricane the population was estimated at 23 individuals and at present, the wild population is estimated at between 34 and 40.<ref name="BirdLife">{{cite web|url= http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/search/species_search.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=1666&m=0 |title= Puerto Rican Parrot - BirdLife Species Factsheet |publisher= BirdLife International |accessdate=2008-06-18}}</ref><ref name="Q & A"/> The current range of the species is 16&nbsp;[[Square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]] (6&nbsp;[[Square mile|sq mi]]), 0.2% of what it once was.<ref name="iucn"/>

==Behavior==
The Puerto Rican Amazon is diurnal, typically beginning its day half an hour after sunrise.<ref name="p.71">Snyder ''et al.'', p. 71</ref> It is generally secretive when inside its nest, using its green plumage as camouflage. In contrast, it may be vocal and noisy when outside the nest. Upon taking flight, its color pattern provides some contrast to the forest. The flight mechanism of this species is similar the one found in other Amazons, and involves strokes below the body axis, unlike most birds whose wings flow above their bodies in flight. Amazons can fly moderately fast, reaching a top speed of approximately 30&nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]] (18&nbsp;[[Miles per hour|mph]]), and are fairly agile when evading predators in mid-air.<ref name=Sny67>Snyder ''et al.'', p. 67</ref> When in search of food, the parrots group in pairs. Couples and their [[fledge]]d young display a tendency to stay together.<ref name=Sny68>Snyder ''et al.'', p. 68</ref> The Amazon makes two flight calls, a take-off squawk which consist of a pattern of long squawks, and a loud "bugle", commonly used in flight and which may have several meanings depending on the circumstances when it is used.<ref name=Sny70>Snyder ''et al.'', p. 70</ref>

===Diet===
Like almost all Amazons, the Puerto Rican Amazon is a [[herbivore]]. Its diet consists of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar obtained from the forest's [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]]. The species has been recorded to consume more than 60 different materials, although its diet was historically more varied due to its larger [[Range (biology)|range]]. Among the items it consumes are the [[Exocarp|pericarp]] of the seeds of sierra palm (''Prestoea montana''), tabonuco (''[[Dacryodes excelsa]]''), and negra lora (''Matayba domingensis''); the fruits of ''bejuco de rana'' (''Marcgravia sintenisii''), camasey (''Miconia sintenisii''), cupey de altura (''Clusia gundlachii''), and ''palo de cruz'' (''Rheedia portoricensis''); the flowers of bejuco de rana, achiotillo (''Alchornea latifolia''), and ''Piptocarpha tetrantha''; the leaves and twigs of cupeillo (''Clusia grisebachiana''), laurel sabino (''[[Magnolia splendens]]''), caimitillo verde (''Micropholis garciniaefolia''), and ''Piptocarpha tetrantha''; the bark of bejuco de rana, cupeillo, and cachimbo cumun (''Psychotria berteriana''); and the [[bud]]s of cuaba (''[[Inga vera]]'').<ref name="p.81<U+2013>83">Snyder ''et al.'', pp. 81<U+2013>83</ref> It normally selects the fruits positioned directly in front of its eyes, picking them one at a time with some rare exceptions.<ref name=Sny79>Snyder ''et al.'', p. 79</ref> When feeding, it uses a foot to pick up the food.<ref name=Sny81>Snyder ''et al.'', p. 81</ref> The Amazon feeds in a slow, paused manner taking 8&ndash;60&nbsp;seconds to consume separate items.<ref name=Sny82>Snyder ''et al.'', p. 82</ref>

===Breeding===
The Puerto Rican Amazon usually mates for life, with pairs only changing mates if one bird perishes or abandons the nest.<ref name=Sny131>Snyder ''et al.'', p. 131</ref> A male may abandon the female if the latter is injured, re-mating with a more "physically perfect" subject.<ref name=Sny131/> The pairing process is unknown; however, new pairs tend to participate in mutual mating dances characterised by coordinated bows, partial extension of the wings and full tail expansion.<ref name=Sny132>Snyder ''et al.'', p. 132</ref>

The Puerto Rican Amazon is a secondary [[Bird nest#Cavity|cavity nester]], nesting in tree trunk cavities, both naturally occurring and excavated by other species. It prefers to nest in ''Palo colorado'' trees (''[[Cyrilla racemiflora]]''), but uses other trees, including the laurel sabino (''Magnolia splendens'') and tabonuco (''Dacryodes excelsa''), to a lesser extent. These trees are mature cavity-forming trees which provide protection against predators and the entry of water. Recently, the species has also nested in artificial wooden boxes designed as part of the recovery plan for the species. Nest height varies from 7&ndash;15&nbsp;m (23&ndash;50&nbsp;ft) above ground. The male usually leads the search for nest sites, although the final decision seems to be taken by the female.<ref name=Sny141>Snyder ''et al.'', p. 141</ref> Once a site is selected, the pair will spend some time inspecting and cleaning it. No lining material is added to the [[Bird nest|nest]].

The Puerto Rican Amazon reaches [[sexual maturity]] at 4&nbsp;years of age in the wild and at 3&nbsp;years in captivity. The species usually reproduces once a year between the months of January and July (the [[dry season]]). Copulation between pairs seems to be closely related to food transfers, with this possibly serving as a trigger for intercourse.<ref name=Sny149>Snyder ''et al.'', p. 149</ref> Amazons have a copulation pattern similar to that found in other parrots throughout the Americas, with the male gripping a perch with one leg while passively placing the other in the female's back.<ref name=Sny150>Snyder ''et al.'', p. 150</ref> As the time for egg-laying approaches the pair spends more time in the nest, with the male providing food to the female via regurgitation.<ref name=Sny148>Snyder ''et al.'', p. 148</ref> The female lays 2&ndash;4&nbsp;eggs that she exclusively incubates for a period of 24 to 28 days, while the male will be present in the vicinity of the nest when providing food.<ref name=Sny155>Snyder ''et al.'', p. 155</ref> Females rarely leave the nest, leaving it on rare occasions involving repelling predators or if the male has not brought food in an extended time frame.<ref name=Sny156>Snyder ''et al.'', p. 156</ref> The [[chick]]s are fed by both parents until they leave the nest, usually 60 to 65&nbsp;days after they hatch.<ref name="Q & A">{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/southeast/pubs/facts/PR_parrot_QA.pdf|title=Puerto Rican Parrots - Questions and Answers|publisher=[[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]]| format=PDF| accessdate=2008-06-04}}</ref> Nonetheless, they remain dependent on their parents and travel with them until the next breeding season.<ref name=aud06>{{cite web|title=Puerto Rican Parrot (''Amazona vittata'')|url=http://audubon2.org/webapp/watchlist/viewSpecies.jsp?id=168|publisher=National Audubon Society|accessdate=2008-06-18}}</ref>

Like other Amazons, the Puerto Rican Amazon is gregarious while performing daily activities, but territorial around its nest.<ref name=Forshaw541>Forshaw and Cooper, p. 541</ref> The size of the territory around the nest is usually around 50&nbsp;meters (164&nbsp;feet).<ref name = CMI/> Pairs are extremely cautious near their nest, usually moving in a slow manner when leaving the nest to avoid the attention of predators.<ref name=Sny157>Snyder ''et al.'', p. 157</ref> Although territorial defense is mostly composed of loud vocalizations there are instances of actual physical combat.<ref name=Sny136>Snyder ''et al.'', p. 136</ref> Pairs will defend their nest sites against invading couples, sometimes focusing on the location's defense instead of egg-laying. Pairs nesting in areas uninhabited by other parrots will remain mostly silent unless other parrots enter the zone.<ref name=Sny136/> Some pairs may display moderate territoriality even when not apparently intending to nest, with these tendencies beginning in the latter half of the breeding season. One hypothesis is that this would occur in young pairs that had still not reached full maturity, serving as "practice territoriality".<ref name=Sny139>Snyder et al., p. 139</ref>

==Threats and conservation==

On March&nbsp;11, 1967 the Puerto Rican Amazon entered the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species]] list.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/SpeciesReport.do?spcode=B00L| title=Species Profile: Puerto Rican parrot (Amazona vittata)| publisher=U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service| accessdate=2008-06-18}}</ref> At the time of inclusion the population was estimated at 70 individuals. In 1968, recovery efforts began to increase the population in the wild.<!--http://ecos.fws.gov/SpeciesProfile?spcode=B00L--><ref name="p.225">Snyder ''et al.'', p. 225</ref> In 1972, when the estimated population was 16 individuals, the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS) at the Luquillo Aviary began efforts to breed parrots in captivity. Conservation efforts have paid off remarkably. In June 2006, it was reported by the USFWS that its birds in captivity had successfully hatched 39 chicks (the yearly average is around 16). The total wild population is currently estimated between 34<U+2013>40 individuals.

The [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) lists the Puerto Rican Amazon as a [[critically endangered species]] since 1994.<ref name="iucn"/> The species is regulated under Appendix&nbsp;I of the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.shtml |title=Appendices I, II and III |accessdate=2008-07-14 |publisher=[[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]]}}</ref> rendering illegal international trade in specimens or parts. 

===Threats===
[[Image:RedtailedHawk23.jpg|right|thumb|[[Red-tailed Hawk]] (''B. j. jamaicensis''), known as ''Guaraguao'' in Puerto Rico, a natural predator of the Puerto Rican Amazon.]]
Human activity is arguably the main reason for the population decline of the Puerto Rican Amazon.<ref name=RecoveryPlan/> Early settlers of Puerto Rico, such as the Ta<U+00ED>no, hunted it for food consumption but managed to maintain a healthy ecological balance. Later, habitat destruction, capture of immature individuals for the pet industry, hunting and predation contributed to the sharp population decline. The clearing of mature forests for agricultural development is the main reason for the decline of population.

Natural predators of the Puerto Rican Amazon include the [[Red-tailed Hawk]] (''Buteo jamaicensis''), the [[Broad-winged Hawk]] (''Buteo platypterus''), the [[Peregrine Falcon]] (''Falco peregrinus'') and the [[Pearly-eyed Thrasher]] (''Margarops fuscatus'').<ref name="Q & A"/><ref name="Oberle"/> The thrasher invaded Puerto Rico in the mid-20th century and has been a problem for the parrot population since 1973; to combat this, specially designed deep nests were prepared for the parrots in subsequent years to prevent competition from the invaders.<ref name=Forshaw540>Forshaw and Cooper, p. 540</ref> Introduced [[Western honeybee|honeybees]] (''Apis mellifera''), the related Hispaniolan Amazon (''Amazona ventralis''), [[Black rat]]s (''Rattus rattus'') and [[Small Asian Mongoose|Indian mongooses]] (''Herpestes javanicus'') may compete for nesting cavities, and the latter two may eat eggs and chicks.<ref name="BirdLife"/>

Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, were not a threat to the Puerto Rican Parrot population when it was more readily self-maintaining, but as a result of the fragmentation and reduction of the population these disasters are now a threat as well. [[Hurricane Hugo]] passed through the species' range in September 1989, and reduced the population from 47 to 23 individuals.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=1011| title=Hurricane Effects on Wildlife and Ecosystems| publisher=U.S. Geological Survey| date=[[1998-12-08]]| accessdate=2008-05-18}}</ref>

===Recovery plan===
In response to the Puerto Rican Amazon's low population and endangered status, a recovery plan was drafted and implemented in 1968. Its main objective was to downlist the species to threatened status by the year 2020.<ref name=RecoveryPlan/> Other objectives included establishing two separate viable wild populations (each of which would consist of 500 or more individuals for a period of at least five years), protecting habitat for those populations, and controlling predators, parasites and competitors.

As part of the conservation efforts, a captive population was established in the Luquillo Aviary in 1973.<ref name=RecoveryPlan/> Another was established in 1993 when some individuals where transferred from the Luquillo Aviary to the Rio Abajo State Forest under the administration of the Puerto Rican Department of Natural Resources (''Departamento de Recursos Naturales y Ambientales'').<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.fws.gov/endangered/bulletin/2003/07-12/16-17.pdf| title=From Cage to Rainforest |author= Thomas H.
