The '''"Thin Man"''' [[nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]] was a proposed [[plutonium]] [[Gun-type fission weapon|gun-type]] nuclear bomb which the [[United States]] was developing during the [[Manhattan Project]]. Its development was aborted when it was discovered that the [[spontaneous fission]] rate of [[nuclear reactor]]-[[Breeder reactor|bred]] plutonium was too high for use in a gun-type design.

==Early decisions==
In 1942, prior to the Army taking over wartime atomic research, [[Robert Oppenheimer]] held conferences in Chicago in June and [[Berkeley, California]], in July at which various engineers and physicists discussed nuclear bomb design issues. A gun-type design was chosen, in which two sub-[[critical mass]]es would be brought together by firing a "bullet" into a "target".{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=42<U+2013>44}} The idea of an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]] was suggested by [[Richard Tolman]] but attracted scant consideration.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=55}}

Oppenheimer, reviewing his options in early 1943, gave priority to the gun-type weapon,{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=55}} but as a hedge against the threat of pre-detonation, he created the E-5 Group at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] under [[Seth Neddermeyer]] to investigate implosion. Implosion-type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms of explosive yield per unit mass of fissile material in the bomb, because compressed fissile materials react more rapidly and therefore more completely. It was decided that the plutonium gun would receive the bulk of the research effort, since it was the project with the least amount of uncertainty involved. It was assumed that the uranium gun-type bomb could be more easily adapted from it.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=87}}

The gun-type and implosion-type designs were codenamed "Thin Man" and "[[Fat Man]]" projects respectively. These code names were created by [[Robert Serber]], a former student of Oppenheimer's who worked on the Manhattan Project. He chose them based on their design shapes; the "Thin Man" would be a very long device, and the name came from the [[Dashiell Hammett]] detective novel ''[[The Thin Man]]'' and [[The Thin Man (film)|series of movies]] by the same name; the "Fat Man" bomb would be round and fat and was named after [[Sydney Greenstreet]]'s character in ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''. "[[Little Boy]]" would come last and be named only to contrast to the "Thin Man" bomb.{{sfn|Serber|Crease|1998|p=104}}

==Development==
[[File:Thin Man plutonium gun bomb casings.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.4|"Thin Man" plutonium gun test casings at [[Wendover Air Force Base|Wendover Army Air Field]], as part of [[Project Alberta]] in the [[Manhattan Project]]. "[[Fat Man]]" casings can be seen behind them.]]
Oppenheimer assembled a team at the Los Alamos Laboratory to work on plutonium gun design that included senior engineer [[Edwin McMillan]] and senior physicists [[Charles Critchfield]] and [[Joseph Hirschfelder]]. Critchfield had been working with [[sabot]]s, which Oppenheimer believed would be required by the Thin Man to achieve the high muzzle velocities that [[critical assembly]] would require. Hirschfelder had been working on [[internal ballistics]]. Oppenheimer led the design effort himself until June 1943, when Navy [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[William Sterling Parsons]] arrived took over the Ordnance and Engineering Division and direct management of the "Thin Man" project.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=83<U+2013>84}}

These four created and tested all the elements of the Thin Man design between April 1943 and August 1944. Parsons, who had developed the [[proximity fuze]] for the Navy, ran the division, and handled liaison with other agencies. As the head of the E-6 Projectile, Target, and Source Group, Critchfield calculated critical masses, and instituted a system of live testing with scale models using [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20 mm cannon]] and [[3"/50 caliber gun|3-inch gun]]s. While full-scale Thin Man tubes took months to produce, these  were readily and easily obtained.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=83<U+2013>84, 111<U+2013>112}} It was not possible to conduct tests with plutonium, as it was not yet available. Indeed, the actual physical characteristics of the metal were little more than educated guesses at this time.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=126<U+2013>128}}

Hirschfelder headed the E-8 Interior Ballistics Group. His group performed mathematical calculations, but he also had to identify a suitable [[gunpowder|powder]], [[igniter]] and [[Primer (firearm)|primer]]. His group conducted full-scale tests with their selections.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=112<U+2013>114}} Fixing the physical size of the bomb proved important when it came to selecting a suitable aircraft to carry it.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=126<U+2013>128}} The E-8 group estimated the muzzle velocity of the gun at around {{convert|3000|ft/s}}, close to the maximum achievable in 1944,{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=106}} and calculated that the pressure in the barrel would be up to {{convert|75000|psi}}.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=126<U+2013>128}}

Although it was felt that simply bringing a critical mass together would be sufficient, Serber suggested that the design should also include an [[Modulated neutron initiator|initiator]]. A [[polonium-210]]-[[beryllium]] initiator was chosen because [[polonium 210]] has a 140-day [[half life]], which allowed it to be stockpiled, and it could be obtained from naturally-occurring ores from [[Port Hope, Ontario]]. However, Oppenheimer requested that it also be manufactured in the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], or, when they became available, the reactors at the [[Hanford Site]].{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=119<U+2013>123}}

==Specifications==
The "Thin Man" design was an early nuclear weapon design proposed before plutonium had been successfully bred in a [[nuclear reactor]] from the irradiation of [[uranium-238]]. It was assumed that plutonium, like [[uranium-235]], could be assembled into a critical mass by a [[gun-type nuclear weapon|gun-type]] method, which simply involved shooting one sub-critical piece into another. To avoid pre-detonation or "[[Fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzle]]", a plutonium "bullet" would need to be accelerated to a speed of at least {{convert|3000|ft/s|m/s}}<U+2014>or a [[nuclear fission|fission]] reaction would begin before the assembly was complete, blowing the device apart prematurely.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=106}}

Thin Man was {{convert|17|ft|m}} long, with a {{convert|38|in|cm|adj=on}} wide tail and nose assemblies, and a {{convert|23|in|cm|adj=on}} midsection. The length was necessary for the plutonium "bullet" to pick up adequate speed before reaching the "target". Weight was around {{convert|8000|lb|kg}} for the final weapon model.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=76<U+2013>77}} There was only one aircraft in the Allied inventory that could carry a Thin Man unmodified: the British [[Avro Lancaster]]. However, the American B-29 could be modified to carry it by removing part of the main wing spar and some oxygen tanks located between its two bomb bays.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=107, 119}}

==Design issues==

===Aerodynamics===
The great length of the "Thin Man" bomb led to aerodynamic instabilities.  Subscale models of the bomb were dropped from a [[TBF Avenger]] at the US Navy test range at [[Dahlgren, Virginia]] starting in August, 1943.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=42}} The bombs would spin sideways after being dropped, and broke up when they hit the ground.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=380}}

Twenty four drops were carried out in March 1944 before tests were discontinued so that improvements could be made to Thin Man. The bombs failed to release immediately, frustrating [[calibration]] tests. In what turned out to be the last test flight of the series on 16 March, a Thin Man was prematurely released while the B-29 was still ''en route'' to the test range and fell onto the bomb bay doors, severely damaging the test aircraft.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=76<U+2013>77}}  The modified glider mechanisms used to suspend the bomb in the bomb bay had caused all four malfunctions, due to the great weight of the bombs. They were replaced with British Type G single-point attachments and Type F releases as used on the Lancaster to carry the {{convert|12000|lb|adj=on}} [[Tallboy bomb]].{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=8<U+2013>10}}

===Predetonation===
The feasibility of a plutonium bomb had been questioned in 1942. [[James Bryant Conant|James Conant]] heard on 14 November from [[Wallace Akers]], the director of the British [[Tube Alloys]] project, that [[James Chadwick]] had "concluded that plutonium might not be a practical fissionable material for weapons because of impurities."{{sfn|Nichols|1987|p=64}} Conant consulted [[Ernest Lawrence]] and [[Arthur Compton]], who acknowledged that their scientists at Berkeley and Chicago respectively knew about the problem, but could offer no ready solution. Conant informed the director of the Manhattan Project, [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], who in turn assembled a special committee consisting of Lawrence, Compton, Oppenheimer and McMillan to examine the issue. The committee concluded that any problems could be overcome by requiring higher purity.{{sfn|Nichols|1987|pp=64<U+2013>65}}

In April 1944, experiments by [[Emilio G. Segr<U+00E8>]] and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos on the newly reactor-produced [[plutonium]] from Oak Ridge and the Hanford site showed that it contained impurities in the form of the [[isotope]] [[plutonium-240]]. This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate and radioactivity than [[plutonium-239]]. The [[cyclotron]]-produced  isotopes on which the original measurements had been made has much lower traces of plutonium-240. Its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium appeared unavoidable. This meant that the spontaneous fission rate of the reactor plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely that it would [[predetonation|predetonate]] and blow itself apart during the initial formation of acritical mass.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=228}} The distance required to accelerate the plutonium to speeds where predetonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber. The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was thus implosion <U+2014> a far more difficult engineering task.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=240<U+2013>244}}

The impracticability of a gun-type bomb using plutonium was agreed at a meeting in Los Alamos on July 17, 1944. All gun-type work in the Manhattan Project was directed at the Little Boy enriched uranium gun design, and almost all of the research at the Los Alamos Laboratory was re-oriented around the problems of implosion for the Fat Man bomb.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=240<U+2013>244}}
