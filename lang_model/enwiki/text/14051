Fisk University features the world-famous [[Fisk Jubilee Singers]], originally a group of traveling students who set out from Nashville to earn enough money to save the school and raise sufficient funds to build the first permanent structure in the country solely built for the education of newly-freed slaves, the renowned and recently-restored Jubilee Hall.
