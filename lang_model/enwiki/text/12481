'''Samuel Gridley Howe''' ([[November 10]], [[1801]] - [[January 9]], [[1876]]) was a prominent [[19th century]] [[United States]] [[physician]], [[abolitionist]], advocate of education for the [[blindness|blind]]. He was the husband of [[Julia Ward Howe]] and the father of [[Pulitzer prize]]-winning writers [[Laura E. Richards]] and [[Maud Howe Elliott]].

==Biography==
Howe was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].<!--''Below from an old public domain encyclopedia; modify as necessary''--> His father, Joseph N. Howe, was a ship-owner and cordage manufacturer; and his mother, Patty Gridley, was one of the most beautiful women of her day. Young Howe was educated at Boston and at [[Brown University]], Providence, and in [[1821]] began to study medicine in Boston. He took the degree of [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] at [[Harvard Medical School]] in [[1824]].  But fired by enthusiasm for the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek revolution]] and by [[George Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron<U+2019>s]] example, he was no sooner qualified and admitted to practice than he abandoned these prospects and took ship for [[Greece]], where he joined the army as a [[surgery|surgeon]].  In Greece his services were not confined to the duties of a surgeon, but were of a more military nature, and his bravery, enthusiasm, and ability as a commander, as well as his humanity and nobility of character, won for him the title of "The Lafayette of the Greek Revolution."<ref name="NIE">[[New_International_Encyclopedia]]</ref> Then, to raise funds and supplies to alleviate the famine and suffering in Greece, he returned to America in [[1827]]; his fervid appeals enabled him to collect about $60,000, which he spent on provisions and clothing, and he established a relief depot near [[Aegina]], where he started works for the refugees, the existing quay, or American Mole, being built in this way. He formed another colony of exiles on the Isthmus of [[Corinth]]. He wrote a ''Historical Sketch of the Greek Revolution'', which was published in [[1828]].  He then spent some time in medical studies at [[Paris]], where his enthusiasm for a republican form of government led him to take part in the [[July Revolution|July Revolution]]. In [[1831]] he returned to America. Here a new object of interest engaged him. Through his friend Dr. John Dix Fisher (d.1850), a Boston physician who had started a movement there as early as 1826 for establishing a school for the blind, he had learned of a similar school founded in [[Paris]] by [[Valentin Ha&#252;y]]. It was proposed to Howe by a committee organized by Fisher that he should direct the establishment of a <U+201C>New England Asylum for the Blind<U+201D> at Boston. He took up the project with characteristic ardour, and set out at once for Europe to investigate the problem. There he was temporarily diverted from his task by becoming mixed up with the [[Poland|Polish]] revolt. He became chairman of the American&#45;Polish Committee at Paris, organized by himself, [[James Fenimore Cooper|J. Fenimore Cooper]], [[Samuel F. B. Morse|S. F. B. Morse]], and several other Americans living in the city, for the purpose of giving relief to the Polish political refugees who had crossed over the Prussian border into Prussia.  Dr. Howe undertook to distribute the supplies and funds personally and while in [[Berlin]] he was arrested and imprisoned at Berlin, but was released after five weeks through the intervention of the American minister at Paris.

Returning to Boston in July 1832, he began receiving a few blind children at his father<U+2019>s house in Pleasant Street, and thus sowed the seed which grew into the famous [[Perkins School for the Blind|Perkins Institution]]. In January 1833 the funds available were all spent, but so much progress had been shown that the legislature approved funding, later increased to $30,000 a year, to the institution on condition that it should educate gratuitously twenty poor blind from the state; money was also contributed from Salem and Boston. Colonel [[Thomas Handasyd Perkins]], a prominent Boston trader in slaves, furs, and opium, then presented his mansion and grounds in Pearl Street for the school to be held there in perpetuity. This building being later found unsuitable, Colonel Perkins consented to its sale, and in 1839 the institution was moved to the former Mount Washington House Hotel in South Boston.  It was henceforth known as the "Perkins Institution and Massachusetts Asylum (or, since 1877, School) for the Blind."

Howe was director, and the life and soul of the school; he opened a printing-office and organized a fund for printing for the blind <U+2014> the first done in America; and he was unwearied in calling public attention to tile work. The Institution, through him, became one of the intellectual centres of American philanthropy, and by degrees obtained more and more financial support. In 1837, Howe brought [[Laura Bridgman]], to the school, a young [[deaf-blind]] girl who later became a teacher at the school. She became famous as the first known deaf-blind person to be successfully educated.

Dr. Howe himself was the originator of many improvements in method as well as in the process of printing books in raised types.  Besides acting as superintendent of the Perkins Institution to the end of his life, he was instrumental in establishing a large number of institutions of a similar character throughout the country.  
==Antislavery activities==
He entered publicly into the antislavery struggle for the first time in 1846, when as a "Conscience Whig," he was an unsuccessful candidate for [[United States Congress|Congress]] against [[Robert Charles Winthrop|Robert C. Winthrop]].<ref name="NIE" /> In 1851 he was one of the founders and editor of an antislavery paper, the Boston ''Daily Commonwealth'', upon which his wife, Julia Ward Howe, assisted him.  Howe funded the abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and the [[Underground Railroad]] as a a member of the [[Secret Six]]. After Brown's arrest, Howe temporarily fled to Canada.

==Philanthropic activities==
Howe also brought about the establishment of the Massachusetts School for Idiotic Children (later renamed the [[Walter E. Fernald State School]]), the Western Hemisphere<U+2019>s oldest publicly-funded institution serving the mentally disabled. He founded the school in 1848 with a $2,500 appropriation from the Massachusetts Legislature. For nearly a century the school was viewed as a model educational facility for the congenitally retarded, but after 1950 it fell into much disrepute due to unconscionable conditions for the incarcerated children and a series of unethical radiological experiments performed upon some boys.

He was the originator of the State Board of Charities of Massachusetts, in 1863, the first board of the sort in America, and was its chairman from that time until 1874.  In 1866 he made a last trip to Greece to carry relief to the [[crete|Cretan]] refugees and in 1870 was a member of the commission sent by [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Grant]] to inquire into the practicability of the annexation of Santo Domingo.  He was a prominent member of the [[Bleeding Kansas|Kansas Committee]] in Massachusetts, and with Sanborn, Stearns, [[Theodore Parker]], and [[Gerrit Smith]], was interested in the plans of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], although he disapproved of the attack upon [[Harper's Ferry, West Virginia|Harper's Ferry]].  During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] Howe was one of the directors of the [[United States Sanitary Commission|Sanitary Commission]] and at its close entered into the work of the [[Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands|Freedmen's Bureau]].
