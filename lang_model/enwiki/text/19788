The '''Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey''' is an American multi-mission, military, [[tiltrotor]] [[aircraft]] with both a vertical takeoff and landing ([[VTOL]]), and short takeoff and landing ([[STOL]]) capability. It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional [[helicopter]] with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a [[turboprop]] aircraft. 

The V-22 originated from the [[United States Department of Defense]] Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental (JVX) aircraft program started in 1981.  The team of [[Bell Helicopter]], and [[Boeing Rotorcraft Systems|Boeing Helicopters]] was awarded a development contract in 1983 for the tiltrotor aircraft.  The Bell Boeing team jointly produce the aircraft.<ref name=Boeing_V22overview/>  The V-22 first flew in 1989, and began years of flight testing and design alterations; the complexity and difficulties of being the first tiltrotor intended for military service in the world led to many years of development. 

The [[United States Marine Corps]] began crew training for the Osprey in 2000, and fielded it in 2007; it is supplementing and will eventually replace the [[CH-46 Sea Knight]].  The Osprey's other operator, the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] fielded their version of the tiltrotor in 2009.  Since entering service with the U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force, the Osprey has been deployed for combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Flight testing of four full-scale development V-22s began in early 1997 when the first pre-production V-22 was delivered to the Naval Air Warfare Test Center, [[Naval Air Station Patuxent River]], [[Maryland]]. The first EMD flight took place on 5 February 1997. The first of four [[low rate initial production]] aircraft, ordered on 28 April 1997, was delivered on 27 May 1999.

===Controversy===
<!-- Consider moving parts of content here to other sections as appropriate.  See talk page. -->

The V-22's development process has been long and controversial, partly due to its large cost increases.<ref name= 'texasobs'>{{cite web |url = http://www.texasobserver.org/article.php?aid=1679 |title = Review of political forces that helped shape V-22 program |first = Robert |last = Bryce |publisher = Texas Observer |date = 17 June 2004}}</ref>  The V-22's development budget was first planned for $2.5 billion in 1986, then increased to a projected $30 billion in 1988.<ref name="Wired 200507"/> As of 2008, $27 billion have been spent on the Osprey program and another $27.2 billion will be required to complete planned production numbers by the end of the program.<ref name="V-22_CRS_RL31384"/>

The V-22 squadron's former commander at [[Marine Corps Air Station New River]], Lt. Colonel Odin Lieberman, was relieved of duty in 2001 after allegations that he instructed his unit that they needed to falsify maintenance records to make the plane appear more reliable.<ref name="V-22_CRS_RL31384"/><ref>{{cite web |url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/66970987.html?dids=66970987:66970987&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+19%2C+2001&author=Thomas+E.+Ricks&pub=The+Washington+Post&desc=Marines+Fire+Commander+Of+Ospreys%3B+Alleged+Falsification+Of+Data+Investigated&pqatl=google |title = Marines Fire Commander Of Ospreys; Alleged Falsification Of Data Investigated |first = Thomas E.|last = Ricks |publisher = Washington Post |date = 19 January 2001}}</ref> Three officers were later implicated in the falsification scandal.<ref name= 'texasobs'/>

The aircraft is incapable of [[autorotation]], and is therefore unable to land safely in helicopter mode if both engines fail. A director of the Pentagon's testing office in 2005 said that if the Osprey loses power while flying like a helicopter below {{convert|1600|ft|m|lk=on|sigfig=2}}, emergency landings "are not likely to be survivable". But Captain Justin (Moon) McKinney, a V-22 pilot, says there is an alternative, "We can turn it into a plane and glide it down, just like a [[C-130 Hercules|C-130]]".<ref name="time">{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1665835-1,00.html |title=V-22 Osprey: A Flying Shame |first=Mark |last=Thompson |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=26 September 2007 |accessdate=}}</ref> A complete loss of power would require the failure of both engines, as one engine can power both proprotors via interconnected drive shafts.<ref name=GlobalSecurity_prop>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/v-22-propulsion.htm |title=V-22 Osprey: Propulsion System |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |date= 8 February 2006 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref><ref name="Norton_p98-9"/> While [[Vortex ring state#Vortex ring effect in helicopters|vortex ring state]] (VRS) contributed to [[#Notable accidents|a deadly V-22 accident]], the aircraft is less susceptible to the condition than conventional helicopters and recovers more quickly.<ref name="AF_mag_finally"/> The Marines now train new pilots in the recognition of and recovery from VRS and have instituted operational envelope limits and instrumentation to help pilots avoid VRS conditions.<ref name="Wired 200507"/><ref name="Proceedings Sept2004"/>

The Osprey is the world's first production tiltrotor aircraft, with one three-bladed [[proprotor]], turboprop engine, and transmission [[nacelle]] mounted on each wingtip. It is classified as a [[powered lift]] aircraft by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]].<ref name="tilters">{{cite journal |last=Croft |first=John |date=1 September 2007 |title=Tilters |journal=Air & Space Magazine |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/osprey.html}}</ref>  For takeoff and landing, it typically operates as a helicopter with the nacelles vertical and rotors horizontal. Once airborne, the nacelles rotate forward 90<U+00B0> in as little as 12 seconds for horizontal flight, converting the V-22 to a more fuel-efficient, higher-speed turboprop airplane. [[STOL]] rolling-takeoff and landing capability is achieved by having the nacelles tilted forward up to 45<U+00B0>.  For compact storage and transport, the V-22's wing rotates to align, front-to-back, with the fuselage. The proprotors can also fold in a sequence taking 90 seconds.<ref name="USAF Study CV-22">{{cite paper |url=http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/docs/99-033.pdf |format=PDF |title=The CV-22 'Osprey' and the Impact on Air Force Combat Search and Rescue |last=Currie |first=Major Tom P., Jr., USAF |date=April 1999 |version=A Research Report Submitted to the Faculty, In Partial Fulfillment of the Graduation Requirements |publisher=Air Command and Staff College |accessdate= }}</ref>

The V-22's two [[Rolls-Royce T406|Rolls-Royce AE 1107C]] engines are connected by drive shafts to a common center gearbox so that one engine can power both proprotors if an engine failure occurs.<ref name="Norton_p98-9">Norton 2004, pp. 98<U+2013>99.</ref>  Most Osprey missions will use fixed wing flight 75 percent or more of the time, reducing wear and tear on the aircraft and reducing operational costs.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.examiner.com/x-11660-National-Security-Examiner~y2009m5d20-A-long-and-winding-military-procurement-road-The-V22-Osprey-story |title = A long and winding military procurement road: The V-22 Osprey story |first = Jack |last = Satterfield |publisher = National Security Examiner |date = 20 May 2009}}</ref> This fixed wing flight is higher than typical helicopter missions allowing longer range line-of-sight communications and so improved command and control.<ref name="V-22_CRS_RL31384"/>  Boeing has stated the V-22 design loses 10% of its vertical lift over a [[Tiltwing]] design when operating in helicopter mode because of airflow resistance due to the wings, but that the [[Tiltrotor]] design has better short takeoff and landing performance.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/the-dewline/2009/06/boeing-looks-ahead-to-a-v-23-o.html |title = Boeing looks ahead to a 'V-23' Osprey |first = Stephen |last = Trimble |publisher = Flight Global |date = 22 June 2009}}</ref>

The V-22 is equipped with a [[glass cockpit]], which incorporates four [[Multi-function display]]s (MFDs) and one shared Central Display Unit (CDU), allowing the pilots to display a variety of images including: digimaps centered or decentered on current position, [[Forward looking infrared|FLIR]] imagery, primary flight instruments, navigation ([[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]], [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]], [[Instrument landing system|ILS]], [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[Inertial Navigation System|INS]]), and system status. The flight director panel of the Cockpit Management System (CMS) allows for fully-coupled (autopilot) functions which will take the aircraft from forward flight into a 50-foot hover with no pilot interaction other than programming the system.<ref name=AIAA>{{Cite book |author = Ringenbach, Daniel P. and Scott Brick |contribution=Hardware-in-the-loop testing for development and integration of the V-22 autopilot system |title=AIAA Flight Simulation Technologies Conference Technical Papers (A95-39235 10-01) |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=AIAA |booktitle=Technical Papers (A95-39235 10-01) |url=http://pdf.aiaa.org/preview/1995/PV1995_3385.pdf |format=PDF |date=7 August 2005 |accessdate=3 August 2008 |pages= 28<U+2013>36}}</ref> The glass cockpit of the canceled [[CH-46 Sea Knight#US_versions|CH-46X]] was derived from the V-22.<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA251909 |title = Marine Corps Aviation Assault Support for the 21st Century: Is There a Case for the MV-22 |first = Donald B. |last = Beaver |publisher = Defense Technical Information Center |date = 8 April 1992}}</ref>

[[Naval Air Systems Command]] has devised a temporary fix for sailors to place portable heat shields under Osprey engines to prevent damage to the decks of some of the Navy's smaller amphibious ships.

The US Navy remains a potential user of the V-22, but its role and mission with the Navy remains unclear.  The latest proposal is to replace the [[C-2 Greyhound]] with the V-22 for [[Carrier Onboard Delivery]]. The V-22 would have the advantage of being able to land on and support non-carriers with rapid delivery of supplies and people between the ships of a taskforce, or to ships on patrol beyond helicopter range.<ref>Tilghman, Andrew.
