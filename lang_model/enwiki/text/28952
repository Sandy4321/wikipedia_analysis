"'''Goodbye Mr A'''" is the second single by [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[pop rock]] [[musical ensemble|band]] [[The Hoosiers]] from their debut album ''[[The Trick to Life]]''. The song, released on 8 October 2007, has been noted by ''[[Digital Spy]]''<U+2019>s [[Alex Fletcher]] for its similarities to [[Electric Light Orchestra]]'s single "[[Mr. Blue Sky]]".<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/a76521/the-hoosiers-goodbye-mr-a.html The Hoosiers: 'Goodbye Mr A']</ref> The song is the title track to the video game [[FIFA 08]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.consolemonster.com/newspost.php?id=0000002583 |title=EA Announce FIFA 08 Track List |last=Barker |first=Anthony |accessdate=2007-09-18 |date=2007-11-18 |publisher=Console Monster }}</ref>

The song is in memory of [[lead vocalist|frontman]] Irwin Sparkes' secondary school English teacher, Jonathan "Mr. A" Anderton. Sparkes said he was inspired to write the song upon hearing of Anderton's death in 2006. Many of the lyrics such as: "Too busy, showing me where I'm wrong - you forgot to turn your feelings on...", were reflective of Anderton's personality as a teacher, but Sparkes has described him as being a "really cool guy" in interviews with the media. Sparkes also says that Anderton requested his students call him "Mr. A", as he disliked being called "Mr. Anderton". It is from this that the songs title stems.

==Music video==
The music video to "Goodbye Mr A" is reminiscent of [[superhero]] [[comic books]] and popular culture, such as the 1960s ''[[Batman]]'' TV series. In the video, the band kidnaps the world's greatest hero, [[Mr. A]], a comic-book character, and take his place fighting crime as incompetent anti-heroes. Despite being fired into space at the end, Mr. A survives and opens his eyes, this is a reference to the film [[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]. The song is featured in the [[association football|football]] [[video game]] ''[[FIFA 08]]'', and the game can also be seen in the "Goodbye Mr A" [[music video]]. Lead singer [[Irwin Sparkes]], who is from [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], is playing on the game as [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. The song also appears in a trailer for the 2007 film, 'Juno'.
