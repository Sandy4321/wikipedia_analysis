'''Earvin''' "'''Magic'''" '''Johnson Jr.''' (born August 14, 1959) is a retired American professional [[basketball]] player who played [[point guard]] for the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). After winning championships in [[High school basketball#U.S. high school basketball|high school]] and [[College basketball|college]], Johnson was selected first overall in the [[1979 NBA Draft]] by the Lakers. He won a championship and an [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award]] in his rookie season, and won four more championships with the Lakers during the 1980s. Johnson retired abruptly in 1991 after announcing that he had [[HIV]], but returned to play in the [[1992 NBA All-Star Game|1992 All-Star Game]], winning the [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star MVP Award]]. After protests from his fellow players, he retired again for four years, but returned in 1996 to play 32&nbsp;games for the Lakers before retiring for the third and final time.

Johnson's career achievements include three [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|NBA MVP Awards]], nine [[NBA Finals]] appearances, twelve [[List of NBA All-Stars|All-Star]] games, and ten [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA]] First and Second Team nominations. He led the league in regular-season [[assist (basketball)|assists]] four times, and is the NBA's all-time leader in assists per game, with an average of 11.2.<ref name="alltimeassist">{{cite web|title=All Time Leaders: Assists Per Game|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|url=http://www.nba.com/statistics/default_all_time_leaders/AllTimeLeadersAPGQuery.html?topic=4&stat=10|accessdate=2008-05-08}}</ref> Johnson was a member of the "[[United States men's national basketball team#1992 The Dream Team|Dream Team]]", the U.S. basketball team that won the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Olympic]] gold medal in 1992.

==Amateur career==
===Early years===
Earvin Johnson Jr. was <!-- the sixth of ten children --> born to Earvin Sr., a [[General Motors]] assembly worker, and Christine, a school [[janitor|custodian]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/educate/college/careers/profile42.htm|title=Rebounding from basketball court to boardroom|last=Eldridge|first=Earle|date=November 8, 2004|work=USA Today|accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref> Johnson grew up in [[Lansing, Michigan]], and came to love basketball as a youngster, idolizing players such as [[Earl Monroe]] and [[Marques Haynes]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|coauthors=Novak|title=My Life|page=14}}</ref> and practicing "all day".<ref name="nbafullbio" />

Johnson was first dubbed "Magic" as a 15-year-old sophomore playing for Lansing's [[Everett High School (Michigan)|Everett High School]], when he recorded a [[triple-double]] of 36&nbsp;[[point (basketball)|points]], 18&nbsp;[[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] and 16&nbsp;assists.<ref name="nbafullbio" /> After the game, Fred Stabley Jr., a sports writer for the ''[[Lansing State Journal]]'', gave him the [[moniker]]<ref name="magic">{{cite news|first=Jeff|last=Zillgitt|title=Magic Memories of a Real Star|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/zillgitt/2002-09-27-zillgitt_x.htm|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Co.

===Michigan State University===
Although Johnson was recruited by several top-ranked colleges such as [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], he decided to play close to home.<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|coauthors=Novak|title=My Life|page=45}}</ref> He initially wanted to attend the [[University of Michigan]], but decided on [[Michigan State University]] in [[East Lansing]], after the school's basketball coach, [[Jud Heathcote]], promised that Johnson could play the [[point guard]] position.<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|coauthors=Novak|title=My Life|page=48}}</ref>

Johnson did not initially aspire to play professionally, focusing instead on his [[communication studies]] [[Academic major|major]] and on his desire to become a television commentator.<ref name="borkstars">{{cite book|last=Bork|publisher=Die gro<U+00DF>en Basketball Stars|date=1994|pages=56<U+2013>66}}</ref> Playing with future NBA draftees [[Greg Kelser]], [[Jay Vincent]] and [[Mike Brkovich]], Johnson averaged 17.0&nbsp;points, 7.9&nbsp;rebounds, and 7.4&nbsp;assists per game as a [[First year|freshman]], and led the [[Michigan State Spartans|Spartans]] to a 25<U+2013>5&nbsp;record, the [[Big Ten Conference]] title, and a berth in the [[1978 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1978 NCAA Tournament]].<ref name="nbafullbio" /> The Spartans reached the [[Elite Eight]], but lost narrowly to eventual national champion [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/mayhem/history/yearbyyear/1978

During the [[1979 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1978<U+2013>79 season]], Michigan State again qualified for the [[1979 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], where they advanced to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|championship game]] and faced [[Indiana State University]], which was led by senior [[Larry Bird]].

==Professional career==
===Rookie season in the NBA (1979<U+2013>80)===
Johnson was [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|drafted first overall]] in 1979 by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].

===Ups and downs (1980<U+2013>83)===
Early in the [[1980<U+2013>81 NBA season|1980<U+2013>81 season]], Johnson was sidelined after he suffered torn [[cartilage]] in his left knee. He missed 45&nbsp;games,<ref name="stats" /> and said that his [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]] was the "most down" he had ever felt.<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|coauthors=Novak|title=My Life|page=135}}</ref> Johnson returned before the start of the [[1981 NBA Playoffs|1981 playoffs]], but the Lakers' then-assistant and future head coach [[Pat Riley]] later said Johnson's much-anticipated return made the Lakers a "divided team".<ref>{{cite book|last=Riley|first=Pat|title=The Winner Within|publisher=G.P.

After a triple-double from Johnson in Game 6, the Lakers defeated the Sixers 4<U+2013>2, as Johnson won his second NBA Finals MVP award.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=NBA Encyclopedia: Playoff Edition|title=Lakers' Arduous Season Ends in Victory|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19811982.html|accessdate=2008-05-07}}</ref> During the championship series against the Sixers, Johnson averaged 16.2&nbsp;points on .533&nbsp;shooting, 10.8&nbsp;rebounds, 8.0&nbsp;assists, and 2.5&nbsp;steals per game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1982_finals.html|title=1982 NBA Finals Composite Box Score|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref> Johnson later said that his third season was when the Lakers first became a great team,<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|coauthors=Novak|title=My Life|page=148}}</ref> and he credited their success to Riley.<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|coauthors=Novak|title=My Life|page=149}}</ref>

During the [[1982<U+2013>83 NBA season]], Johnson averaged 16.8&nbsp;points, 10.5&nbsp;assists, and 8.6&nbsp;rebounds per game and earned his first All-NBA First Team nomination.<ref name="stats" /> The Lakers again reached the [[1983 NBA Finals|Finals]], and for a third time faced the Sixers, who featured [[center (basketball)|center]] [[Moses Malone]] as well as Erving.<ref name="1983finals">{{cite web|publisher=NBA Encyclopedia: Playoff Edition|title=Moses Helps Dr. J, Sixers Reach Promised Land|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19821983.html|accessdate=2008-05-08}}</ref> With Johnson's teammates [[Norm Nixon]], [[James Worthy]] and [[Bob McAdoo]] all hobbled by injuries, the Lakers were swept by the Sixers, and Malone was crowned the Finals MVP.<ref name="1983finals" /> In a losing effort against Philadelphia, Johnson averaged 19.0&nbsp;points on .403&nbsp;shooting, 12.5&nbsp;assists, and 7.8&nbsp;rebounds per game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1983_finals.html|title=1983 NBA Finals Composite Box Score|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref>

===Battles against the Celtics (1983<U+2013>87)===
[[Image:Magic_Bird_Lipofsky.jpg<U+200E>|thumb|upright|Johnson battles the Boston Celtics Larry Bird for rebounding position in Game two of the 1985 NBA Finals at the Boston Garden.]] 
In Johnson's [[1983<U+2013>84 NBA season|fifth season]], he averaged a [[Double (basketball)#Double-double|double-double]] of 17.6&nbsp;points and 13.1&nbsp;assists, as well as 7.3&nbsp;rebounds per game.<ref name="stats" /> The Lakers reached the [[1984 NBA Finals|Finals]] for the third year in a row, where Johnson's Lakers and Bird's Celtics met for the first time in the post-season.<ref name="1984finals">{{cite web|publisher=NBA Encyclopedia: Playoff Edition|title=Celtics Win First Bird-Magic Finals Showdown|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19831984.html|accessdate=2008-05-07}}</ref> The Lakers won the first game, and led by two points in Game 2 with 18&nbsp;seconds to go, but after a [[layup]] by [[Gerald Henderson]], Johnson failed to get a shot off before the final buzzer sounded, and the Lakers lost 124<U+2013>121 in overtime.<ref name="1984finals" /> In Game 3, Johnson responded with 21&nbsp;assists in a 137<U+2013>104 win, but in Game 4, he again made several crucial errors late in the contest. In the final minute of the game, Johnson had the ball stolen by Celtics center [[Robert Parish]], and then missed two free throws that could have won the game. The Celtics won Game 4 in overtime, and the teams split the next two games. In the decisive Game 7 in Boston, as the Lakers trailed by three points in the final minute, opposing point guard [[Dennis Johnson]] stole the ball from Johnson, a play that effectively ended the series.<ref name="1984finals" /> During the Finals, Johnson averaged 18.0&nbsp;points on .560&nbsp;shooting, 13.6&nbsp;assists, and 7.7&nbsp;rebounds per game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1984_finals.html|title=1984 NBA Finals Composite Box Score|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref> Johnson later described the series as "the one championship we should have had but didn't get".<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|coauthors=Novak|title=My Life|page=196}}</ref>

After announcing his infection in November 1991, Johnson created the [[Magic Johnson Foundation]] to help combat HIV,<ref name="lifeafterdeath">{{cite news|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1023368/1/index.htm|title=Life After Death|last=McCallum|first=Jack|date=August 20, 2001|work=Sports Illustrated|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref> although he later diversified the foundation to include other charitable goals.<ref name="espnaids">{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/gen/s/2001/1105/1274006.html|title=AIDS community misses old Magic act|last=Farrey|first=Tom|date=November 7, 2001|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref> In 1992, he joined the National Commission on AIDS, but left after eight months, saying that the commission was not doing enough to combat the disease.<ref name="lifeafterdeath" /> He was also the main speaker for the [[United Nations]] (UN) [[World AIDS Day]] Conference in 1999,<ref name="espnaids" /> and has served as a [[United Nations Messengers of Peace|United Nations Messenger of Peace]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901EEDA1131F935A2575AC0A96E958260|title=Sports of The Times; The Greatest Is Honored by The Diplomat|last=Rhoden|first=William C.|date=September 16, 1998|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref>

HIV had been associated with drug addicts and homosexuals,<ref name="lifeafterdeath" /> but Johnson's campaigns sought to show that the risk of infection was not limited to those groups. Johnson stated that his aim was to "help educate all people about what [HIV] is about" and teach others not to "discriminate against people who have HIV and AIDS".<ref name="espnaids" /> Johnson was later criticized by the AIDS community for his decreased involvement in publicizing the spread of the disease.<ref name="lifeafterdeath" /><ref name="espnaids" />

To prevent his HIV infection from becoming AIDS, Johnson takes a [[Antiretroviral drug|daily combination of drugs]].<ref name="misperception">{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-11-30-magic-aids_x.htm|title=Magic Johnson combats AIDS misperceptions|last=Sternberg|first=Steve|date=November 30, 2006|work=USA Today|accessdate=2009-02-16}}</ref> He has advertised [[GlaxoSmithKline]]'s drugs,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/drugs/2003-01-20-magic-glaxo_x.htm|title=Magic Johnson assists drugmaker to advertise HIV treatment|date=January 20, 2003|work=USA Today|accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref> and partnered with [[Abbott Laboratories]] to publicize the fight against AIDS in African American communities.<ref name="misperception" />

==Career achievements==
[[Image:LakersRetiredJerseys.jpg|upright|thumb|alt=A display of yellow basketball jerseys bearing the names and uniform numbers of players|Johnson's number 32 jersey was retired by [[Los Angeles Lakers|the Lakers]] in 1992.]]

In 905&nbsp;NBA games, Johnson scored 17,707&nbsp;points, 6,559&nbsp;rebounds, and 10,141&nbsp;assists, translating to career averages of 19.5&nbsp;points, 7.2&nbsp;rebounds, and 11.2&nbsp;assists per game.<ref name="stats" /> Johnson shares the single-game playoff record for assists (24),<ref name="assrec">{{cite web|publisher=NBA Encyclopedia: Playoff Edition|title=Magic Johnson Career Stats|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/johnsonm_stats.html|accessdate=2008-05-08}}</ref> holds the Finals record for assists in a game (21),<ref name="assrec" /> and has the most playoff assists (2,346).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=NBA Encyclopedia: Playoff Edition|title=All-Time Playoffs Individual Career Leaders|url=http://www.nba.com/history/records/alltime_playoffs_ind_career.html|accessdate=2008-05-08}}</ref> He holds the All-Star Game single-game record for assists (22), and the All-Star Game record for career assists (127).<ref name="assrec" />
Johnson introduced a fast-paced style of basketball called "Showtime", described as a mix of "no-look passes off the [[fast break|fastbreak]], pin-point [[Alley-oop (basketball)|alley-oops]] from [[half court|halfcourt]], spinning feeds and overhand bullets under the basket through [[double team|triple teams]]."<ref name="nbafullbio" /> Fellow Lakers guard [[Michael Cooper]] said, "There have been times when [Johnson] has thrown passes and I wasn't sure where he was going. Then one of our guys catches the ball and scores, and I run back up the floor convinced that he must've thrown it through somebody."<ref name="nbafullbio" /><ref name="espnshowtime" /> Johnson was exceptional because he played point guard despite being 6&nbsp;ft 9&nbsp;in (2.06&nbsp;m), a size reserved normally for [[frontcourt]] players.<ref name="nbafullbio" /> He combined the size of a power forward, the one-on-one skills of a [[swingman]], and the ball handling talent of a guard, making him one of the most dangerous [[triple-double]] threats of all time; his 138&nbsp;triple-double games are second only to [[Oscar Robertson]]'s 181.<ref name="tripledouble">{{cite web|last=Wojnarowski|first=Adrian|title=Making triple trouble|date=2006-11-18|publisher=Yahoo!

For his feats, Johnson was voted as one of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History|50 Greatest Players of All Time]] by the NBA in 1996,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/50greatest.html|title=The NBA at 50|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref> and was inducted into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://assets.espn.go.com/nba/news/2002/0605/1391196.html|title=Johnson, Brown elected to Hall of Fame|date=June 5, 2002|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref> ESPN's ''SportsCentury'' ranked Johnson #17 in their "50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th Century"<ref>"#17: Magic Johnson".

===Rivalry with Larry Bird===
Johnson and [[Larry Bird]] were first linked as rivals after Johnson's Michigan State squad defeated Bird's Indiana State team in the 1979 [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] finals. The rivalry continued in the NBA, and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in three out of four NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987. Johnson asserted that for him, the 82-game regular season was composed of 80 normal games, and two Lakers<U+2013>Celtics games. Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson's daily [[box score]] was the first thing he checked in the morning.<ref name="magiclarryquotes" />

Several journalists hypothesized that the Johnson<U+2013>Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness ("Showtime") and Boston/Indiana [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]] grit ("Celtic Pride"), and between blacks and whites.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bork|title=Basketball Sternstunden|date=1995|pages=49<U+2013>55}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/web/COM1057184/1/index.htm|title=The Stuff Dreams Are Made Of|last=Halberstam|first=David|date=1987-06-29|work=Sports Illustrated|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref> The rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA. Prior to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA had gone through a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/26/earlyshow/leisure/main523385.shtml|title='Magic' Time|publisher=CBS News|date=2002-09-27|accessdate=2008-05-08}}</ref> With the two future Hall of Famers, the league won a whole generation of new fans,<ref name="cbc">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2002/08/14/magic020814.html|title=Larry Bird inducting Magic Johnson|publisher=CBC Sports|date=2002-08-15|accessdate=2008-05-08}}</ref> drawing both traditionalist adherents of Bird's dirt court Indiana game and those appreciative of Johnson's public park flair. Sports journalist Larry Schwartz of ESPN asserted that Johnson and Bird saved the NBA from bankruptcy.<ref name="espnshowtime" />

Despite their on-court rivalry, Johnson and Bird became close friends during the filming of a 1984 [[Converse (company)|Converse]] shoe advertisement that depicted them as enemies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aamidor|first=Abraham|title=Chuck Taylor, All Star: The True Story of the Man Behind the Most Famous Athletic Shoe in History|date=2006|page=151|isbn=0253346983}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014103.html|title=Eye for victory|last=Schwartz|first=Larry|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2009-02-28}}</ref> Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony in 1992, and described Bird as a "friend forever";<ref name="magiclarryquotes">{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/Classic_NBA_Quotes_Magic_and_Larry.html|title=Classic NBA Quotes: Magic and Larry|publisher=NBA Encyclopedia: Playoff Edition|accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref> during Johnson's Hall of Fame ceremony, Bird formally inducted his old rival.<ref name="cbc" />
