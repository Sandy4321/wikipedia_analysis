'''Spacebus''' is the name given to a family of geostationary telecommunications satellites developed starting in the 1980s by [[Aerospatiale]], now [[Thales Alenia Space]], in its [[Cannes Mandelieu Space Center]].

They can be equipped with different payloads, but they are most often used as [[communications satellite]]s. Their typical [[orbit]] around [[Earth]] is [[geostationary]].

== History ==
During that period, [[Aerospatiale]] was allied with the German company [[Messerschmitt]] (MBB) for the manufacture of satellites, among which was the Franco-German [[Symphonie (Satellite)|Symphonie]] program.  After an in-house brainstorming within the two firms, it was [[Guy Leb<U+00E8>gue]], an engineer in the marketing department of Aerospatiale/Satellites, who invented the Spacebus name, with reference to the aeronautic program [[Airbus]]. The name is trademarked.

A '''franco-German Spacebus agreement''' was signed, on December 9, 1983 between [[:fr:Henri Martre|Henri Martre]], Aerospatiale's CEO and Hans Vogels, the MBB's President. The [[trademark]] was registered.

The '''Spacebus''' name becomes a [[Product (business)|product]]. Many dozens of them were built and sold on the [[Global Marketing|export market]], bringing a lot of [[Currency|curencies]] to the countries of the participating firms, increasing their [[Balance of trade]] as regard of the price of a Spacebus, close to the Airbus [[A 320]] price.

A number follows the name representing the weight class of the satellites.  1000 for the metric ton, 2000, etc.

The name Spacebus was also given to satellites which were being manufactured while the trademark was being registered, although they have a different architecture (but ''not the Symphonie satellites'' which had already been launched several years before, and ''are not therefore in the Spacebus family''.  

* Spacebus100for the first generation ''Arabsat'' satellites
* Spacebus 300 for the direct television satellites in the Franco-German program, and the Swedish [[Tele-X]] program.

== Architecture ==
{{main|Service module}}
A [[satellite]] is generally composed of two sections: the [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]], which is specific to the mission (telecommunications, Earth observation, navigation, science, etc.) and the platform (or service module) which provides the payload with all the necessary functions.

The idea was to develop a generic platform able to adapt itself to various future missions and to the evolutions in the capacity of [[launch vehicle]]s in order to reduce manufacturing costs and if possible to create a series effect.

And in fact, more than sixty Spacebuses have been built, since the SB1000 Arabsat satellites in the one-ton class in 1981 up to the SB4000, weighing more than four tons, of the years 2000.

The architecture of the platform is based on:

* A modular design with separate U-shaped payload module, allowing parallel integration between Aerospatiale for the Service Module and a telecom equipment manufacturer for the Communication Payload, followed by the final mating, and test in the Cannes Space Center.
* A central tube in [[composite material]] made of a [[composite honeycomb]] and [[carbon fibre]] sandwich, acting as the satellite<U+2019>s spinal column, interfacing with the launcher, housing two [[fuel]] tanks.  Several panels are attached to it caring equipment for servicing.  Also attached are three panels carrying the telecommunications payload equipment, two of which (in honeycomb sandwich with aluminium sides to let calories pass through) will act as [[thermal radiator]]s allowing the heat generated by the payload to dissipate into the cold of space by [[radiation]].  At the beginning, these elements were produced in the Les Mureaux centre of Aerospatiale.  After the separation of its satellite activity, the space centre in Cannes Mandelieu took over the manufacture of these elements in composite materials, and in particular, the production of the all the plane structures.  The central tube, requiring very special tooling remained in Les Mureaux, which had become [[EADS]].  A second source is [[SAAB]] in Sweden.

* A thermal control system necessitating very sophisticated computation programs and technologies which were developed in Cannes: dissipating radiators, super insulation, electric heaters, [[heat pipe]]s.
* Rigid [[solar cell]]s arrays, with various combinations of panels depending on the electrical power requirements
* An electric architecture developed by ETCA in Belgium, with [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] of evolving technology from Nickel-Hydrogen to [[Lithium-Ion]].
* [[Energy (chemistry)|Chemical propulsion]] based on bi-propellant technology developed by MBB in Germany. The [[electric propulsion]] was also studied, developed and introduced for two satellites: Stentor and [[Astra 1K]], both of which were unfortunately lost during launch.
* A three-axis [[Attitude control|attitude]] and [[Orbital Maneuvering System|orbit control]] system developed initially by MBB.
* Various [[Mechanism (technology)|mechanisms]] for opening solar arrays and antennas developed and built in Cannes.

== The Versions ==
The Spacebus evolution towards heavier satellites followed the capacity of launchers from [[Ariane 1]] to [[Ariane 5]].  But it should be noted that Spacebuses have always been designed to adapt to all available launchers on the commercial market: not only the various versions of Ariane, but also [[Thor Delta]], [[Atlas rocket]], [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz]], [[Proton]], [[Long March]] and even exceptionally for launch by the [[Space Shuttle]] Discovery for one of the Arabsat satellites launched on the [[STS-51-G]] mission.  These versions will be declined in the following charts.  The tables show the <U+201C>end of mission<U+201D> meaning the end of operational use; after which, the satellite is often uncontrolled, perhaps slightly de-orbited (a manoeuvre strongly recommended by the satellite operator), and will drift for eternity, its <U+201C>end of life<U+201D> not signifying very much. Please also note that certain satellites have changed operators, either before launch or during their orbital life. They can even in this case change their orbital position.

===Spacebus 100 ===
[[File:STS-51-G Arabsat 1-B deployment.jpg|right|thumb|Arabsat-1B going outside the [[Space Shuttle]] cargo bay]]
This was, in 1981, the first appearance of the definitive architecture with the production of the first three Arabsat-1 satellites for the 22 members of the [[Arab League]] and its [[Arab Satellite Communications Organization]] (Arabsat), with 2 kW of electrical power. Later on during the programme, the name ''Spacebus 1000'' may be used, to allow more easy comparison with the ''Spacebus 2000'' satellites.

;Launchers
* Two were launched by '''Ariane''' in its '''[[Ariane 3]]''' and '''[[Ariane 4]]''' versions
* [[Arabsat-1B]] was launched by the [[Space Shuttle]], [[STS-51-G]] mission to which [[Patrick Baudry]] was participating. It needs an additional rocket motor to transfer the satellite between the [[Low Earth orbit]] of the Shuttle to the [[geosynchronous transfer orbit]]: PAM-D.

=== Spacebus 2000 ===
The architecture evolves upwards with the availability of the new [[Ariane 4]] launcher. Electrical power supply is 3.5 kW.

The customers diversify.
* [[Image:Flag of Europe.svg|20px]] [[Eutelsat]]. It becomes the first customer of the Spacebus family, ordering 6 satellites.
* [[Image:Flag of Argentina.svg|20px]] Nahuelsat, an [[Argentina|Argentine]] company of which [[SES S.A.|SES]] became a shareholder.
* [[Image:Flag of Turkey.svg|20px]] [[T<U+00FC>rk Telekom]] and its series of Turksats for [[Turkey]], delivered on a [[turnkey]] basis.
* [[Image:Flag of the United States.svg|20px]] [[GE Americom]] which takes over the Nahuel 1B satellite which becomes GE-5 for the United States and which became AMC 5 when taken over by SES.
GE-5 is the '''First''' European satellite saled to USA.

;Launchers
* Ten amnong eleven of these satellites were launched by '''Ariane 4''', but unfortunately two of them were lost due to a launch failure of V63 on 1994-01-24. But especially, the Spacebuses become the number one customers of [[Arianespace]].
* A new launcher is used: [[Atlas (missile)]].

=== Spacebus 3000 ===
In the advent of [[Ariane 5]] launches the Spacebus 3000 appears with masses between 2 and 6 metric tons and electrical power supply of 5 to 16 kW.  It is declined into several versions profiting from the ever larger payload fairings.

In 1991 the cooperation was further extended with the creation of "Satellite Alliance" which brought in three partners: [[:fr:Alcatel Espace|Alcatel Espace]], [[Alenia]] and [[Space Systems/Loral]].

==== Spacebus 3000A ====
First version developed for the second generation for [[Arabsat]].  It was adopted by two new customers:
* [[Image:Flag of Thailand.svg|20px]] [[Shin Satellite|Shinawatra]] private customer from [[Thailand]] and its Thaicom satellites, the first Spacebus to cover Asia, becoming [[Shin Satellite|Thailand's Shin Satellite Ltd]] for the Thaicom 5
* [[Image:Flag of the People's Republic of China.svg|20px]] [http://www.sinosatcom.com/english/ Sinosat] for [[China]] and the satellite Sinosat-1.  The customer is EuraSpace, a common 50/50 subsidiary between DASA and China Aerospace Corporation (CASC).

;Launchers
* Always '''Ariane 4'''
* A first launch with '''Ariane 5''': Tha<U+00EF>com 5.
* A new launcher is used for Sinosat: the Chinese [[Long March Rocket]].

=== Spacebus 4000 ===
The 4000 family appears with mainly a modification to the [[avionics]] (Avionics 4000):
* Electrical architecture of the platform goes from 50 to 100 Volts
* [[On-board]] [[computer]] is very integrated, flexible and modular 
* [[Attitude control|Attitude]] and Orbit Control System (AOCS)with Star-tracker for use in geostationary orbit (a world first).

The family is declined like the B series according to the height of the satellite in 4000B2, 4000B3.  And a new C version appears whose basic dimensions are 2.2 x 2.0 meters.

;Spacebus ITAR-Free
Some of the satellites of this new series are designed to be [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations|Itar-Free]], allowing easy exportation to China to be launched by the [[Long March (rocket family)|Long March launchers]]<ref>ITAR free SPACEBUS 4000B2, 23 Jul 2008, [http://telecom.esa.int/telecom/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=28086 telecom.esa.int]</ref>.
