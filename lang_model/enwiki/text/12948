==Early life and education==
[[File:Mujaddid Ijaz with his mother, sisters and brother, circa 1957.png|thumb|left|240px|Ijaz with his mother and siblings, 1957]]
Mujaddid Ijaz was born on June 12, 1937 in [[Baddomalhi]], [[British Indian Empire]]. His father was a medical student who died in his mid-20s of brain cancer. His mother, a homemaker, remarried. He was the third of ten children in his family. Ijaz's early education was made at rural village schools near Baddomalhi. He attended [[Township, Lahore#Schools and colleges|Islamia High School]] in Lahore.<ref name="Floyd 1">{{cite news|title=Dr. Ijaz Promoted|author=Staff Report|publisher=''Floyd Press''|date=1972-07-06| accessdate=2014-05-02}}</ref> His early interest in science and physics was attributed to his step-father's work in the local meteorology department.

After graduating from high school and finishing college entrance exam requirements, Ijaz was admitted to [[Government College University, Lahore|Government College]] in Lahore.<ref name="MAI NYT"/> There, he majored in physics and graduated with a B.Sc. in 1957. He continued advanced studies under the tutelage of Prof. [[Rafi Muhammad Chaudhry]], widely considered a pioneer in Pakistani [[experimental physics]], until 1959 when he met Razia Begum Nazir. They later married and emigrated to the United States in 1960.<ref name="Floyd 2">{{cite news|title=Pakistan Couple Made American Citizens|author=Staff Report|publisher=''Floyd Press''|date= 1970-02-12|accessdate= 2014-05-02}}</ref>

Ijaz and his wife arrived in [[Tallahassee]], [[Florida]] in August 1960, where they settled as incoming graduate students at [[Florida State University]].<ref name="Floyd 2"/> He developed an early interest in particle physics and accelerator experiments while at [[Florida State University|Florida State]], from where he graduated in June 1962 with a Master's degree in Physics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.fsu.edu/alumni/default.asp?aclass=1962|title=Florida State Alumni, Class of 1962|publisher=[[Florida State University]]|author=Alumni Listing|accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref> His thesis was titled ''Study of Angular Distributions of Elastically Scattered 8 to 19 Mev Alpha Particles from Al27''<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uO1wPwAACAAJ&dq=mujaddid+ijaz&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1DpVU76GM-eS7QaL8YCgBw&redir_esc=y|title=Study of Angular Distributions of Elastically Scattered 8 to 19 Mev Alpha Particles from Al27|author=Mujaddid A.

===Virginia Polytechnic Institute===
Mujaddid Ijaz joined the faculty of the [[Virginia Tech]] Physics department in September 1964 as an Assistant Professor of Physics.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ch/books?id=JIpYAAAAMAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=mujaddid+ijaz|title=Directory of Physics Faculties: United States, Canada, Mexico|author=American Association of Physics Teachers|author2=American Institute of Physics|year=1965|accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref> In his early years as a faculty member, Ijaz devoted much of his time to his teaching responsibilities,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/28/12/10.1063/1.3069253|title=Motivating students|author=M.

He conducted his early research at the Physics department's newly installed nuclear reactor, which at the time was equipped with a [[neutron activation analysis]] laboratory.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.phys.vt.edu/about/history.shtml|title=Virginia Tech Department of Physics - History|publisher=[[Virginia Tech]], Department of Physics|accessdate= 2014-05-01}}</ref> Ijaz's early experimental results earned him an appointment as research collaborator at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratories]] in 1966 under a UNISOR ''(University Isotope Separator at Oak Ridge)'' grant funded by the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Energy Department]].<ref name="Roanoke Times"/>

In 1974, Ijaz launched a ''Distinguished Visitors Colloquium Series'' under the Physics department's sponsorship that brought world-renowned physicists to the [[Blacksburg, Virginia|Blacksburg]] campus for nearly a decade. Visiting scholars included Salam, [[Sheldon Lee Glashow|Sheldon Glashow]], and Nobel physics laureates [[Hans Bethe]], [[Robert Hofstadter]], [[Eugene Paul Wigner|Eugene Wigner]] and [[Richard Feynman]]. Noted Chinese physicist Luke W. Mo (whose group at the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator]] had won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1990) also lectured at Virginia Tech.<ref name="Quarta">{{cite web|url=http://www.phys.vt.edu/newsletters/QuantaSpring2003.pdf|title=2002-2003 Department Retirements - Professor Luke W.

Mujaddid Ijaz began his research work at the Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL) in 1966 under Virginia Tech funding contributed to the UNISOR program.<ref name="Roanoke Times"/> UNISOR was a consortium at that time of 13 institutions whose research scientists were collaborating at Oak Ridge supported by U.S. Energy Department grants together with [[Oak Ridge Associated Universities]], of which Virginia Tech was one. Ijaz's research focused on the discovery of new [[isotope]]s using ORNL's [[High Flux Isotope Reactor]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ameslab.gov/files/ric_news/RIC.News.V5/RIC.News.V5.N2.pdf|title=Rare Earth Information Center News|publisher= Institute for Atomic Research, [[Iowa State University]]|date=1970-06-01|accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref>{{brokenlink|date=April 2015}} The reactor was built in 1965 with the highest [[neutron flux]] of any reactor at the time. It produced more medical isotopes while allowing higher fidelity of materials research than any other reactor available in the U.S. Energy Department's science and energy laboratory system during the 1970s. Ijaz and his colleagues at Oak Ridge, led by Kenneth S.

===Notable collaborations===
Mujaddid Ijaz collaborated with notable physicists and mathematicians throughout his 27-year career. Most notable among these were his collaborations with [[Abdus Salam]]<ref name="Newsweek">{{cite news|url=http://newsweekpakistan.com/who-is-memogates-mansoor-ijaz/|title=Who in the World is Mansoor Ijaz?|author=Fasih Ahmed| publisher=''[[Newsweek Pakistan]]''|date=2011-12-02|accessdate=2012-05-12}}</ref> whose groundbreaking work in [[electroweak interaction]]s together with American physicists [[Steven Weinberg]] and [[Sheldon Glashow]] earned them the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979.

In 1976, Salam recommended creating an international forum for the advancement of science and technology to be hosted by Pakistan in the [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]] region while serving as [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)|Science Advisor]] to the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]]. Since then, the [[International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics|Nathiagali Physics Conferences]] has gathered notable scientists from around the world during summer breaks to break the intellectual isolation faced by Pakistani scientists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncp.edu.pk/insc/|title=International Nathiagali Summer College|publisher=National Centre for Physics and [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]]}}</ref> Ijaz participated in these conferences several times during the mid-1970s under [[National Science Foundation]] grants.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1976STATE152586_b.html|title=NSF/SFCP.

Mujaddid Ijaz married Razia Begum (''nee'' Nazir) in June 1960 prior to emigrating to the United States. Razia later took her husband's chosen name, Lubna, when they both became naturalized American citizens on January 5, 1970.<ref name="Messenger">{{cite news|title=Mr. & Mrs. Ijaz Became American Citizens Jan. 5, 1970|author=Staff Reporting|publisher=''Montgomery News Messenger''|date=1970-01-27}}</ref> They had five children: [[Mansoor Ijaz|Mansoor]], Farouk, Atif and Mujeeb. Neelam, their only daughter, was born in Pakistan.<ref name="Floyd 1"/>

The Ijazes initially settled in Blacksburg, where Virginia Tech was situated, and lived there from 1964 until 1969.<ref name="Messenger"/> After several years of living in the rural community of [[Floyd, Virginia]],<ref name="Floyd 1"/><ref name="Floyd 2"/> they returned to [[Christiansburg, Virginia|Christiansburg]], a township near Virginia Tech, in 1973, building a home in the Appalachian Mountains that today remains the family's homestead.<ref name="Newsweek"/> 

Mujaddid Ijaz died on July 9, 1992 at his home in [[Shawsville, Virginia]] of complications arising from a protracted battle with brain and lung cancer.<ref name="MAI NYT"/> He was buried in traditional Muslim rituals at the site of his most favored farm in Alum Ridge, surrounded by a large gathering of his family from around the United States and his physics colleagues and friends from southwestern Virginia. President [[George H. W. Bush]] consoled Ijaz's widow in a [[:File:President George H. W. Bush condolences on Mujaddid Ijaz's death, 1992.png|letter dated July 24, 1992]].
