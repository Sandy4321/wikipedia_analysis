'''The Most Ancient Ruling Clan of The World'''<ref>{{cite book | title = Kerala State Gazetteer, Volume 2, Part 1. | author = State Editor |publisher = Kerala Gazetteer | year = 1986 | page = 22}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = Premitive Civilizations or - Outlines of the History of Ownership In Archaic Communities, Volume 1 | author = Edith Jemima Simcox | page = 548}}</ref>

Nair Dynasty is considered as one of the archaic dynasty in the world and the only one archaic community which is still hailing and existing with its most ancient inheritance, customs, usages, practices, and Serpent Worship<ref>{{cite book | title = Premitive Civilizations or - Outlines of the History of Ownership In Archaic Communities, Volume 1 | author = Edith Jemima Simcox | page = 485}}</ref>.  Nair clan is well-known as supreme at endurance, rage, jurisprudence, special status to woman, and genetic expertise of weaponry<ref>{{cite book | title = Premitive Civilizations or - Outlines of the History of Ownership In Archaic Communities, Volume 1 | author = Edith Jemima Simcox | page = 211,457,563}}</ref>.  The glory of Nair dynasty was so radiant to emanate the terminologies as Nagarikatha(The Civilization), Nagara(The City), Nayaka(The Leader), Nagarika(The citizen), Devanagari<ref>{{cite book | title = Elements of South-Indian Paliography from the Fourth to the Seventeenth Century A.D. | author = Arthur Coke Burnell | page = 286-318}}</ref>(The Sanskrit script<ref>{{cite book | title = Alphabet: An Account Of The Origin And Development Of Letters | author = Isaac Taylor | page = 349}}</ref>)etc. towards all sects of Indian languages.


==Ancientness of the existence==

There was a period where vedas were not divided into four. Veda was only one.  The knowledge, in-depth knowledge about any specific subject.  It was technology, it was philosophy, it was literature, it was arts, it was medical science, it was every thing and strictly communicated in shruthi(verbal) manner, over that period (before the period when Veda was not divided into four, and not written in manuscripts) Nair Dynasty was called The Serpent Dynasty (Naga Dynasty)<ref>{{cite book | title = Matrilineal system in Malabar | author = P.

'''In the Manuscript written by Duarte Barbosa in 1510 AD, it is conjectured:'''

"Plato may have borrowed the family law of his Republic from that of the Nairs, who also bear a considerable resemblance to his class of guardians; and the undoubted resemblance between Cretan or Spartan and Malayali usage makes it almost certain that Plato had in his mind a phase of Cretan custom developed in a direction approaching more or less closely to that of Malabar"<ref>{{cite book | title = Description of The Coast of East Africa and Malabar | author = Duarte Barbosa (Manuscript is in Central Library of Barcelona) | publisher = printed for Hakluyt Society | year = 1790 }}</ref>


==The System of Government in Nair Dynasty==


'''The ancient system of Government in Nagaloka was called KULASANGHA VAZCHA(<U+0D15><U+0D41><U+0D32><U+0D38><U+0D02><U+0D18><U+0D35><U+0D3E><U+0D34><U+0D4D><U+0D1A>). This is a perplexed kind of ruling system where coordination and continuity is always assured. The references listed are amble enough to deduce the robustness of the system and how Nair Dynasty has pursued a long history from pre-vedic period up to AD 1700.'''<ref>{{cite book | title = The Eastern journal of international law | publisher = Eastern center of international studies | year = 1976 | page = 259}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = Glorious epoch:Svayambhuva Manu to Shakari Shalivahan, 29000 B.C to 135 A.D | author = Shripad Dattatraya Kulkarni | year = 1994 | page = 119}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = History of Travancore from the earliest times | author = P.

*In '''"A survey of Indian constitutionalism"''' Rajeswara Rao mentions;

'''"Kula-Sangha System"''' is hard to conquer and being free from the danger of anarchy, enjoys permanent existence on earth."

*In "'''A History of India" by Hermann Kulke, Dietmar Rothermund''', it is said;<ref>{{cite book | title = A History of India |	author = Hermann Kulke, Dietmar Rothermund | publisher = Croom Helm Australia Pvt. Ltd. | year = 1986 | page = 104}}</ref>

"The early south indian kings seems to have derived their legitimation from indegenous loyalties and network of their respective clan. This sometimes implied the division of power among many divisions of the clan. The kingdom of the southwest coast(Kerala) must have been such a large-scale family enterprise. Kautilya has refered to this system of government in his arthasastra; he mentioned it as '''"Kula-Sangha"''' and thought that it was quite efficient".

===Organization of The Government===
The system was divided in to two major sections on the aspect of intervention into the public and military administration.  Those are called KulaSangha Vazcha and DesaVazcha(<U+0D26><U+0D47><U+0D36><U+0D35><U+0D3E><U+0D34><U+0D4D><U+0D1A>). DesaVazcha is subordinate to the KulaSangha Vazcha. Topmost representation of the Dynasty was called KulaSekhara Perumal(<U+0D15><U+0D41><U+0D32><U+0D36><U+0D47><U+0D16><U+0D30> <U+0D2A><U+0D46><U+0D30><U+0D41><U+0D2E><U+0D3E><U+0D33><U+0D4D><U+200D>), KulaSekhara Alvar(<U+0D15><U+0D41><U+0D32><U+0D36><U+0D47><U+0D16><U+0D30> <U+0D06><U+0D34><U+0D4D><U+0D35><U+0D3E><U+0D30><U+0D4D><U+200D>) etc. Below that, there were a number of Naduvazhis(<U+0D28><U+0D3E><U+0D1F><U+0D41><U+0D35><U+0D3E><U+0D34><U+0D3F><U+0D15><U+0D33><U+0D4D><U+200D>) representing the subdivisions of same clan. Each Nadu is a collection of Desams. All kind of diplomatic relations and inter dynastic relations were dealt by this council(KulaSekhara Alwar and Naduvazhis). The 12-yearly Mamankam(<U+0D2E><U+0D3E><U+0D2E><U+0D3E><U+0D19><U+0D4D><U+0D15><U+0D02>) festival was the official meeting event with the presence of whole of the Naduvazhis in the Dynasty. As same as the history of Nair Dynasty, the history and origin of Mamankam also is unknown. The overseas international connections and trade relations to Roman Empire, Egyptian Empire, Malasian Empire, etc. evidentiate that The grand Trade fest Mamankam was the point of attraction of Kerala. The emperor and Naduvazhi will be a member of Nair clan by their own leniage. It is a peculiar specification about this Government system that the Emperor(KulaSekhara Alwar) and King(Naduvazhi) is not suppose to have sovereign authority over the armed force.<ref>{{cite book | title = The spirit and form of Indian polity | author = Aurobindo Ghose}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = A survey of Indian constitutionalism | author = P. Rajeswara Rao | publisher = Sree Panduranga Press | year = 1950 | page = 31}}</ref>

===Decentralized Military Administration===
The second level is "Desavazcha" where the military administration and public coordination is at its apex. The territorial area of the Desam was distinguished by the number of warriors provided from that desam. There will be number of desams in a nadu and each desham would be headed by the prominent nair family chief known as desavazhi. Each desavazhi is responsible to appoint, train, and provide services to the Naduvazhi at the consensus of other desavazhis of the Nadu. Therefore, naduvazhi is not the only person who decide to wage a war. Many early historians have mentioned wonderingly about nair kingdoms(nadu) living in peaceful atmosphere even though they are having large number of army and expertise in weaponry. Meetings of the "DesaVazhi Counsil" is conducted at the major temple at each desam.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Indian journal of public administration, Volume 43 | publisher = Indian Institute of public administration | year = }}</ref>

===Public Administration===
Each Desham(<U+0D26><U+0D47><U+0D36><U+0D02>) is divided in to number of "Thara(<U+0D24><U+0D31>)", Then each "Thara" would be divided in to number of "Kara(<U+0D15><U+0D30>)", each kara will be divided in to multiple Kazhakams(<U+0D15><U+0D34><U+0D15><U+0D02>) which will have 4 to 8 Nair families and one among them appointed as the head of the Kazhakam. Each divisional official meeting is called Tharakootam(<U+0D24><U+0D31><U+0D15><U+0D4D><U+0D15><U+0D42><U+0D1F><U+0D4D><U+0D1F><U+0D02>), Karayogam(<U+0D15><U+0D30><U+0D2F><U+0D4B><U+0D17><U+0D02>), and Kottil(<U+0D15><U+0D4A><U+0D1F><U+0D4D><U+0D1F><U+0D3F><U+0D32><U+0D4D><U+200D>) respectively. Still today thousands of places are there in Kerala suffixed with "Thara" and "Kara."<ref>{{cite book | title = The Decline of Nair Dominance | author = Robin Jeffrey | page = 272}}</ref>

==The Knowledge Domains Handled by Nair Dynasty in an Exponential Level==

Public Administration System<ref>{{cite book | title = The Indian journal of public administration, Volume 43 | publisher = Indian Institute of public administration | page = 79}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = The Decline of Nair Dominance | author = Robin Jeffrey | page = 272}}</ref>, Highly Sophisticated Military System<ref>{{cite book | title = Pracheena Malayalam | author = Sri.Chattampi Swamikal | year = 1913 | pages = 80<U+2013>88}}</ref>, [[Indian Astronomy|Astronomy]], [[Indian Mathematics|Mathematics]], [[jyotisa|Astrology]], [[Malayalam|Most clear and intricate linguistic system in the world]], Vital points pressure treatment in human body(marma chikitsa), Treatment using extracted herbal essence([[Siddha medicine|Sidha Vaidya]]), Anti-venom Treatment(Visha Vaidya), Highly organized and documented herbal treatment practice([[Ayurveda]]), Treatment using extracted metalic ingredients([[Rasayana|Rasaayana Chikitsa]]), [[Tantra|ThantraSaastra]], Architectural expertise([[Vastu Shastra|Vastu Sastra]]), The most advanced handheld and unheld weapons expertise(Dhanurveda), The most antient Martial arts([[Kalarippayattu]]).


==The region of Nair Dynasty==

When the civilized inhabitation was not present on other regions of the globe, the human inhabited regions were divided into three.  They were called heavenly world, The earthly world, and The nether world.  In Indian languages they are called SwarLoka, BhuvarLoka, and Bhoorloka. The region of Himalayas and Himalayan valley were called SwarLoka, and the region between Himalayan valley and Vindhya valley was called Bhuvarloka, and the Regions below or south from Vindhya Mountain were called PathaalaLoka(BhoorLoka).  PathalaLoka was divided into 7 regions as Athala, Vithala, Suthala, Thalaathala, Mahaathala, Rasaathala, and Pathala.  Pathala was the adobe of Nagas ruled by The Great Serpent Anantha.  So the same region hail with name '''Kerala, the God's Own Country'''<ref>{{cite book | title = The origin of Saivism and its history in the Tamil land, Section D | author = K. R. Subramanian | page = 13}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = Hindu culture in ancient India | author = Sekharipuram Vaidyanatha Viswanatha }}</ref>.

'''"Encyclopaedic dictionary of Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>as"''' quotes,<ref>{{cite book | title = Encyclopaedic dictionary of Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>as, Volume 3| author = Swami Parmeshwaranand | page = 762}}</ref>

"This is the region of Naagas(Serpents). At the out-place of this region there is a particular place having an area of 30,000 yojanaas. Vishnu Kala who has the attribute of 'tamasa' lives there under the name "Ananatha." The real Anantha or Aadishesha as the radiant embodiment of this Kala. History says that the Naagas were the early indigenous inhabitants of Kerala. The ancient word "ANANTHA" denotes "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM." The temple of Ananthapadmanaabha at Thiruvananthapuram answers to this description. On the whole the description of Pathaala fits well with that of Kerala. So it is not wrong to infer that the description of Pathaala in puraanaas is entirely about Kerala in all its aspects."

==The Great Serpent Anantha (Adishesha)==

Pathala is the abode of Ananta (Adisesha), a tamasic form of Mahavisnu, known to the Siddhas as Ananta. He has a thousand hoods and Svastika as his badge. Holding in one hand a plough and in the other a wooden pestle he sits worshipped by Sridevi and Varunidevi. At the time of the end of the world the Sankarsanamurti, Rudra, is born from the face of Adisesa shining brightly like poisonous fire and it consumes all the three worlds. Adisesha worshipped by all gods bears this earth on his head like a crown and sits in Patala. When Ananta yawns this wor1d begins to quake along with its oceans, rivers and forests. Nobody has seen an end of his qualities and that is why he is known as Ananta (no end). It was by worshipping this Ananta that the ancient sage Garga learned the truth about the results of Nimitta'sastra (predictions by omens) a division of Jyotisastra<ref>{{cite book | title = Vishnu Purana, Part 2, Chapter 5}}</ref>.

It is well-known that all the worlds are being borne on Ananta's head by the thousand-hooded Adisesha. Ananta is very beautiful with divine brilliance. Other serpent chiefs prostrate before him and at that time they see their reflection on the diamond-mirror-like nails on the toes of Ananta and for some time the serpent chiefs lie there pleasantly looking at the reflection of thier own faces in the nails. The earrings of dazzling brilliance worn by these serpent chiefs reflect on their cheeks and the serpents feel extremely happy when they see the reflection of their faces on the nails.

==Serpent Worship==

The serpent worship is one of the main religious practices in coastal Karnataka and Kerala.  The Pulluvar community is responsible for the ritualistic dance known as Sarpam Thullal and Pulluvan Pattu in Kerala during this worship. The similar dance known as Nagaradhane or Nagamandala is performed by a community called Baidya which is part of Pambada community in coastal Karnataka. Though in coastal karnataka known as Tulu Nadu Shivalli Brahmins also take part in snake worship rituals; in fact, they are indispensable to it.
