'''HMS ''Endeavour''''', also known as '''HM Bark ''Endeavour''''', was a [[Royal Navy]] [[research vessel]] commanded by Lieutenant [[James Cook]] on his [[First voyage of James Cook|first voyage of discovery]], to Australia and New Zealand from 1769 to 1771. 

Launched in 1764 as the [[Collier (ship type)|collier]] ''Earl of Pembroke'', she was purchased by the Navy in 1768 for a scientific mission to the  [[Pacific Ocean]], and to explore the seas for the surmised ''[[Terra Australis Incognita]]'' or "unknown southern land". Renamed and commissioned as ''His Majesty's Bark the Endeavour'', she departed [[Plymouth]] in August 1768, rounded [[Cape Horn]] and reached [[Tahiti]] in time to observe the 1769 [[transit of Venus]] across the Sun. She then set sail into the largely uncharted ocean to the south, stopping at the Pacific islands of [[Huahine]], [[Borabora]] and [[Raiatea]] to allow Cook to claim them for Great Britain. In September 1769, she anchored off New Zealand, the first European vessel to reach the islands since [[Abel Tasman]]'s ''Heemskerck'' 127 years earlier. In April 1770, ''Endeavour'' became the first seagoing vessel to reach the east coast of Australia, when Cook went ashore at what is now known as [[Botany Bay]].

''Endeavour'' then sailed north along the Australian coast. She narrowly avoided disaster after running aground on the [[Great Barrier Reef]], and was beached on the mainland for seven weeks to permit rudimentary repairs to her hull. On 10 October 1770, she limped into port in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] for more substantial repairs, her crew sworn to secrecy about the lands they had discovered. She resumed her westward journey on 26 December, rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 13 March 1771, and reached the English port of [[Dover]] on 12 July, having been at sea for nearly three years.

Largely forgotten after her epic voyage, ''Endeavour'' spent the next three years shipping Navy stores to the [[Falkland Islands]]. Renamed and sold into private hands in 1775, she briefly returned to naval service as a troop transport during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and was [[scuttling|scuttled]] in a blockade of [[Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island]] in 1778. Her wreck has not been precisely located, but relics including six of her cannons and an anchor are displayed at [[maritime museum]]s worldwide. A [[ship replica|replica]] of ''Endeavour'' was launched in 1994 and is berthed alongside the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]] in [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]].

==Construction==
''Endeavour'' was originally a merchant collier named ''Earl of Pembroke'', launched in June 1764 from the coal and whaling port of [[Whitby]] in [[North Yorkshire]].<ref name="EncyclopediaNZ"/> She was [[full rigged ship|ship-rigged]] and sturdily built with a broad, flat bow, a square stern and a long box-like body with a deep hold.<ref name="Hosty41">Hosty and Hundley 2003, p. 41</ref> Her length was {{convert|106|ft|m}}, and {{convert|97|ft|7|in}} on her lower deck, with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|29|ft|3|in|m}}.<ref name="Blainey17">Blainey 2008, p. 17</ref> Her [[burthen]] was 368 71/94&nbsp;tons.<ref name="EncyclopediaNZ">{{cite encyclopedia |year=1966 |title=Ships, Famous |encyclopedia=An Encyclopedia of New Zealand |editor=A.H. McLintock |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage/Te Manat<U+016B> Taonga, Government of New Zealand |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/S/ShipsFamous/Endeavour/en |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref>

A flat-bottomed design made her well-suited to sailing in shallow waters and allowed her to be [[Beach (nautical)|beached]] for loading and unloading of cargo and for basic repairs without requiring a [[dry dock]]. Her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]], internal floors and [[futtock]]s were built from traditional [[white oak]], her [[keel]] and [[stern post]] from [[elm]] and her masts from [[pine]] and [[fir]].<ref>Hosty and Hundley 2003, p. 19</ref> Plans of the ship also show a double [[keelson]] to lock the keel, floors and frames in place.<ref>Hosty and Hundley 2003, pp. 33<U+2013>41</ref>

Some doubt exists about the height of her masts, as surviving diagrams of ''Endeavour'' depict the body of the vessel only, and not the mast plan.<ref name="Marquardt"/> While her main and foremasts are accepted to be a standard {{convert|129|and|110|ft}} respectively, an annotation on one surviving ship plan records the mizzen as "16&nbsp;yards 29&nbsp;inches" ({{#expr:((16+29/36)*0.9144)round1}}&nbsp;m).<ref name="Marquardt"/> If correct, this would produce an oddly truncated mast a full {{convert|30|ft|m}} shorter than the standards of the day.<ref>Sutherland, Rushton, Cooper 1711</ref><ref>Davis and Edson 1985</ref> Modern research suggests the annotation may be a transcription error and should read "26&nbsp;yards&nbsp;29 inches" ({{#expr:((26+29/36)*0.9144)round1}}&nbsp;m), which would more closely conform with both the naval standards and the lengths of the other masts.<ref name="Marquardt">Marquardt 1995, pp. 19<U+2013>20</ref>

==Purchase and refit by Admiralty==
On 16 February 1768, the [[Royal Society]] petitioned [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] to finance a scientific expedition to the Pacific to study and observe the 1769 transit of Venus across the sun.<ref>Rigby and van der Merwe 2002, p. 24</ref> Royal approval was granted for the expedition, and the [[Admiralty]] elected to combine the scientific voyage with a confidential mission to search the south Pacific for signs of the postulated continent ''Terra Australis Incognita'' (or "unknown southern land").<ref>{{cite web |title=Secret Instructions to Lieutenant Cook 30 July 1768 (UK) |publisher=National Library of Australia |year=2005 |url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=34 |accessdate=26 August 2008}}</ref>

The Royal Society suggested command be given to Scottish geographer [[Alexander Dalrymple]], whose acceptance was conditional on a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] commission as a captain in the Royal Navy. However, [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[Edward Hawke]] refused, going so far as to say he would rather cut off his right hand than give command of a Navy vessel to someone not educated as a seaman.<ref name="gutenberg">{{gutenberg |no=14423 |name=A General History and Collection of Voyages and Travels, Vol. 12}}, editor [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]]'s introduction footnote 3</ref> In refusing Dalrymple's command, Hawke was influenced by previous insubordination aboard the sloop {{HMS|Paramour||6}} in 1698, when naval officers had refused to take orders from civilian commander Dr. [[Edmond Halley]].<ref name="gutenberg"/> The impasse was broken when the Admiralty proposed James Cook, a naval officer with a background in mathematics and [[cartography]].<ref name="Courier1878">{{cite news |last=McDermott |first=Peter Joseph |title=Pacific Exploration |work =The Brisbane Courier |page=5 |publisher=Brisbane Newspaper Company Ltd |date=6 November 1878 |url=http://ndpbeta.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/1376345?searchTerm=James+Cook |accessdate=27 August 2008}}</ref> Acceptable to both parties, Cook was promoted to [[Lieutenant]] and named as commander of the expedition.<ref>Rigby and van der Merwe 2002, p. 30</ref>

A [[longboat]], [[pinnace]] and [[yawl]] were provided as ship's boats, though the longboat was rotten and had to be rebuilt and painted with [[white lead]] before it could be brought aboard.<ref name="Hough56">Hough 1994, p. 56</ref> These were accompanied by two privately-owned skiffs, one belonging to the [[boatswain]] John Gathrey, and the other to Banks.<ref>Marquardt 1995, p. 17</ref> The ship was also equipped with a set of {{convert|28|ft|m|abbr=on}} sweeps to allow her to be rowed forward if becalmed or demasted.<ref name="Marquardt18"/> The refitted vessel was commissioned as ''His Majesty's [[Barque|Bark]] the Endeavour'', to distinguish her from another {{HMS|Endeavour|1763 sloop|2}} already commissioned in the Royal Navy, a 14-gun [[sloop of war|sloop]].<ref name="EncyclopediaNZ"/>

On 21 July 1768, ''Endeavour'' sailed to Galleon's Reach to take on armaments to protect her against potentially hostile Pacific island natives.<ref name="Hough56"/> Ten 4-pounder cannons were brought aboard, six of which were mounted on the upper deck and the remainder stowed in the hold.

==Voyage of discovery==
{{main|First voyage of James Cook}}
===Outward voyage===
''Endeavour'' departed Plymouth on 26 August 1768, carrying 94&nbsp;people and 18 months of provisions.<ref>Beaglehole 1968, p. 4</ref>{{ref|provisions|[b]}} Livestock on board included pigs, poultry, two greyhounds and a milking goat.<ref name="replica"/><ref>Marquardt 1995, p. 15</ref>

The first port of call was [[Funchal]] in the [[Madeira Islands]], which ''Endeavour'' reached on 12 September. The ship was recaulked and painted, and fresh vegetables, beef and water brought aboard for the next leg of the voyage.<ref name="Hough7576">Hough 1994, pp. 75<U+2013>76</ref> While in port, an accident cost the life of the master's mate Robert Weir, who became entangled in the anchor cable and was dragged overboard when the anchor was released.<ref>Beaglehole 1968, p. 7</ref> To replace him, Cook [[shanghaiing|shanghaiied]] a sailor from an American sloop anchored nearby.<ref name="Hough7576"/>{{ref|Thurman|[c]}}

''Endeavour'' then continued south along the coast of Africa and across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to South America, arriving in [[Rio de Janeiro]] on 13 November 1768. Fresh food and water were brought aboard and the ship departed for [[Cape Horn]], which she reached during stormy weather on 13 January 1769. However, attempts to round the Cape over the next two days were unsuccessful, with ''Endeavour'' repeatedly driven back by wind, rain and contrary tides. Cook noted that the seas off the Cape were large enough to regularly submerge the bow of the ship as she rode down the crests of waves.<ref name="Beaglehole41-44"/> At last, on 16 January the wind eased and the ship was able to pass the Cape and anchor in the Bay of Good Success on the Pacific coast.<ref name="Beaglehole41-44">Beaglehole 1968, pp. 41<U+2013>44</ref> The crew were sent to collect wood and water, while Banks and his team gathered hundreds of plant specimens from along the icy shore. On 17 January two of Banks' servants died from cold while attempting to return to the ship during a heavy snowstorm.<ref>Hough 1994, pp. 91<U+2013>97</ref>

''Endeavour'' resumed her voyage on 21 January 1769, heading west-northwest into warmer weather. She reached [[Tahiti]] on 10 April,<ref name="Courier1878"/> where she remained for the next two months. The transit of Venus across the Sun occurred on 3 June, and was observed and recorded by astronomer Charles Green from ''Endeavour''<U+2019>s deck.<ref name="Courier1878"/>

===Pacific exploration===
The transit observed, ''Endeavour'' departed Tahiti on 13 July and headed northwest to allow Cook to survey and name the [[Society Islands]].<ref name="Rigby34">Rigby and van der Merwe 2002, p. 34</ref> Landfall was made at Huahine, Raiatea and Borabora, providing opportunities for Cook to claim each of them as British territories. However, an attempt to land the pinnace on the [[Austral Island]] of [[Rurutu (Austral Islands)|Rurutu]] was thwarted by rough surf and the rocky shoreline.<ref>Hough 1994, pp. 133<U+2013>134</ref> On 15 August, ''Endeavour'' finally turned south to explore the open ocean for ''Terra Australis Incognita''.<ref name="Rigby34"/> 

In October 1769, ''Endeavour'' reached the coastline of New Zealand, becoming the first European vessel to do so since [[Abel Tasman]]'s ''Heemskerck'' in 1642.<ref name="Rigby34"/> Unfamiliar with such ships, the [[M<U+0101>ori]] people at Cook's first landing point in [[Poverty Bay]] thought the ship was a floating island, or a gigantic bird from their mythical homeland of [[Hawaiki]].<ref name="ANMM584">{{cite web |title=HMB Endeavour replica - Cook and Endeavour: Endeavour's People |publisher=Australian National Maritime Museum |year=2008 |url=http://www.anmm.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=584 |accessdate=28 August 2008}}</ref> ''Endeavour'' spent the next six months sailing close to shore,<ref name="Courier1878"/> while Cook mapped the coastline and reached the conclusion that New Zealand comprised two large islands and was not the hoped-for ''Terra Australis''. In March 1770, the longboat from ''Endeavour'' carried Cook ashore to allow him to formally proclaim British sovereignty over New Zealand.<ref name="Courier1878"/> On his return, ''Endeavour'' resumed her voyage westward, her crew sighting the east coast of Australia on 19 April.<ref>Beaglehole 1968, p. 299</ref> On 29 April, she became the first European vessel to make landfall on the east coast of Australia, when Cook landed one of the ship's boats on the southern shore of what is now known as [[Botany Bay]], [[New South Wales]].<ref>Hough 1994, pp. 168<U+2013>170</ref>

The line then moves south and west to New Zealand, west to the Australian coast and north to Cape York.|An 1893 chart showing ''Endeavour''<U+2019>s track]]

===Shipwreck===
For the next four months, Cook charted the coast of Australia, heading generally northward. Just before 11&nbsp;pm on 11 June 1770, the ship struck a reef,<ref name="Cook11June">Beaglehole 1968, pp. 343<U+2013>345</ref> today called [[Endeavour Reef]], within the [[Great Barrier Reef]] system. The sails were immediately taken down, a [[Anchor#Kedging|kedging anchor]] set and an unsuccessful attempt was made to drag the ship back to open water. The reef ''Endeavour'' had struck rose so steeply from the seabed that although the ship was hard aground, Cook measured depths up to {{convert|70|ft}} less than one ship's length away.<ref name="Cook11June"/>

Cook then ordered that the ship be lightened to help her float off the reef. Iron and stone ballast, spoiled stores and all but four of the ship's guns were thrown overboard, and the ship's drinking water pumped out.<ref name="Cook11June"/> [[Buoy]]s were attached to the discarded guns with the intention of retrieving them later,<ref name="Parkin317">Parkin 2003, p. 317</ref> but this proved impractical. Every man on board took turns on the pumps, including Cook and Banks.<ref>Parkin 2003, p. 313</ref>

When, by Cook's reckoning, about {{convert|40|to|50|long ton|t}} of equipment had been thrown overboard, on the next high tide a second unsuccessful attempt was made to pull the ship free.<ref>Hough 1994, p. 179</ref> In the afternoon of 12 June, the longboat carried out two large bower anchors, and block and tackle were rigged to the anchor chains to allow another attempt on the evening high tide. The ship had started to take on water through a hole in her hull. Although the leak would certainly increase once off the reef, Cook decided to risk the attempt and at 10:20&nbsp;pm the ship was floated on the tide and successfully drawn off.<ref name="Cook12June">Beaglehole 1968, pp. 345<U+2013>346</ref> The anchors were retrieved, except for one which could not be freed from the seabed and had to be abandoned.<ref name="Cook12June"/>

As expected the leak increased once the ship was off the reef, and all three working pumps had to be continually manned. A mistake occurred in [[Sounding line|sounding]] the depth of water in the hold, when a new man measured the length of a sounding line from the outside plank of the hull where his predecessor had used the top of the cross-beams. The mistake suggested the water depth had increased by about {{convert|18|in|cm}} between soundings, sending a wave of fear through the ship. As soon as the mistake was realised, redoubled efforts kept the pumps ahead of the leak.<ref name="Cook12June"/>

The prospects if the ship sank were grim. The vessel was {{convert|24|mi}} from shore<ref name="Courier1878"/> and the three ship's boats could not carry the entire crew.<ref>Parkin 2003, p. 311</ref> Despite this, the journal of Joseph Banks noted the calm efficiency of the crew in the face of danger, contrary to stories he had heard of seamen panicking or refusing command in such circumstances.<ref>Blainey 2008, p. 236</ref>

Midshipman Jonathon Monkhouse<!-- sometimes spelt Munkhouse, but Cook used "Monkhouse" in his journal. Brother of William Monkhouse, the gunner --> proposed [[fother]]ing the ship, as he had previously been on a merchant ship which used the technique successfully.<ref>Parkin 2003, p. 321</ref> He was entrusted with supervising the task, sewing bits of [[oakum]] and wool into an old sail, which was then drawn under the ship to allow water pressure to force it into the hole in the hull. The effort succeeded and soon very little water was entering, allowing two of the three pumps to be stopped.<ref>Parkin 2003, p. 322</ref>

A small boat carrying eight men rows away from the ship.|''Endeavour'' beached at [[Endeavour River]] for repairs after her grounding on the Great Barrier Reef in 1770. By Johann Fritzsch, published 1786.]]
''Endeavour'' then resumed her course northward and parallel to the reef, the crew looking for a safe harbour in which to make repairs. On 13 June, the ship came to a broad watercourse that Cook named the [[Endeavour River]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Shipping |work=The Brisbane Courier |page=2 |publisher=Brisbane Newspaper Company Ltd |date=13 October 1873 |url=http://ndpbeta.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/1329404?searchTerm=James+Cook |accessdate=27 August 2008}}</ref> Attempts were made to enter the river mouth, but strong winds and rain prevented ''Endeavour'' from crossing the [[sandbar|bar]] until the morning of 17 June. Briefly grounded on a sand spit, she was refloated an hour later and [[warping (sailing)|warped]] into the river proper by early afternoon. The ship was promptly beached on the southern bank and [[careening|careened]] to make repairs to the hull. Torn sails and rigging were also replaced and the hull scraped free of barnacles.<ref>Blainey 2008, pp. 252<U+2013>257</ref> 

An examination of the hull showed that a piece of coral the size of a man's fist had sliced clean through the timbers and then broken off. Surrounded by pieces of oakum from the fother, this coral fragment had helped plug the hole in the hull and preserved the ship from sinking on the reef.<ref name="Parkin335-336">Parkin 2003, pp. 335<U+2013>336</ref>

===Northward to Batavia===
After waiting for the wind, ''Endeavour'' resumed her voyage on the afternoon of 5 August 1770, reaching the northern-most point of [[Cape York Peninsula]] fifteen days later. On 22 August, Cook was rowed ashore to a small coastal island to proclaim British sovereignty over the eastern Australian mainland.<ref>Blainey 2008, pp. 299<U+2013>300</ref> Cook christened his landing place [[Possession Island National Park|Possession Island]], and the occasion was marked by ceremonial volleys of gunfire from the shore and ''Endeavour''<U+2032>s deck.<ref>Hough 1994, pp. 189<U+2013>190</ref> 

[[Image:Track of Endeavour.jpg|300px|thumb|alt=Map:A line runs from the Great Barrier Reef northward to Endeavour River and Cape York, then northwest through Torres Strait to the southern coastline of New Guinea. The line then heads west-southwest to Timor, westward parallel to but south of Java to Christmas Island, and northwest to Batavia.|Route of the Endeavour from the Torres Strait to Java, August and September 1770]]
''Endeavour'' then resumed her voyage westward along the coast, picking a path through intermittent shoals and reefs with the help of the pinnace which was rowed ahead to test the water depth.<ref>Beaglehole 1968, pp. 386<U+2013>389</ref> By 26 August she was out of sight of land, and had entered the open waters of the [[Torres Strait]] between Australia and [[New Guinea]], earlier navigated by [[Luis V<U+00E1>ez de Torres]] in 1606. To keep ''Endeavour''<U+2019>s voyages and discoveries secret, Cook confiscated the log books and journals of all on board and ordered them to remain silent about where they had been.<ref>Beaglehole 1968, p. 426</ref> 

After a three-day layover off the island of [[Savu]], ''Endeavour'' sailed on to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], the capital of the [[Dutch East Indies]], on 10 October.<ref>Beaglehole 1968, pp. 431<U+2013>432</ref> A day later the ship was struck by lightning during a sudden tropical storm, but serious damage was avoided thanks to the rudimentary "electric chain" or [[lightning rod]] that Cook had ordered rigged to ''Endeavour''<U+2019>s mast.<ref>Beaglehole 1968, p. 433</ref> 

The ship remained in very poor condition following her grounding on the Great Barrier Reef in June. The ship<U+2032>s carpenter John Seetterly<!-- or "Satterley", but Cook's log spells it the less traditional way ---> observed that she was "very leaky - makes from twelve to six&nbsp;inches an hour, occasioned by her main keep being wounded in many paces, [[false keel]] gone from beyond the [[wikt:amidships|midships]]. Wounded on her [[wikt:larboard|larbord]] side where the greatest leak is but I could not come at it for the water."<ref>Carpenter's Report, J. Seetterly, 10 October 1770, cited in Hosty and Hundley 2003, pp. 55<U+2013>56</ref> An inspection of the hull revealed that some unrepaired planks were cut through to within <U+215B>&nbsp;inch (3&nbsp;mm). Cook noted it was a "surprise to every one who saw her bottom how we had kept her above water" for the previous three-month voyage across open seas.<ref>Beaglehole 1968, p. 437</ref>

After riding at anchor for two weeks, ''Endeavour'' was heaved out of the water on 9 November and laid on her side for repairs. Some damaged timbers were found to be infested with [[shipworm]]s, which required careful removal to ensure they did not spread throughout the hull.<ref name="ANMM5558">Hosty and Hundley 2003, pp. 55<U+2013>58</ref> Broken timbers were replaced and the hull recaulked, scraped for shellfish and marine flora, and repainted.<ref name="ANMM5558"/> Finally, the rigging and pumps were renewed and fresh stores brought aboard for the return journey to England. Repairs and replenishment were completed by Christmas Day 1770, and the next day ''Endeavour'' weighed anchor and set sail westward towards the [[Indian Ocean]].<ref name="ANMM5558"/>

===Return voyage===
Though ''Endeavour'' was now in good condition, her crew were not. During the ship's stay in Batavia, all but 10 of the 94&nbsp;people aboard had been taken ill with [[malaria]] and [[dysentery]].<ref>Blainey 2008, pp. 338<U+2013>344</ref>{{ref|Disease|[d]}} By the time ''Endeavour'' set sail on 26 December, seven crew members had died and another forty were too sick to attend their duties.<ref name="ANMM5558"/> Over the following twelve weeks, a further 23 died from disease and were buried at sea, including Sp<U+00F6>ring, Green, Parkinson, and the ship's surgeon William Monkhouse.<!-- not to be confused with his brother midshipman Jonathon Monkhouse --><ref name="Courier1878"/> 

Cook attributed the sickness to polluted drinking water, and ordered that it be purified with [[lime (fruit)|lime]] juice, but this had little effect.<ref>Beaglehole 1968, p. 447</ref> Jonathan Monkhouse, who had proposed fothering the ship to save her from sinking on the reef, died on 6 February, followed six days later by ship's carpenter John Seetterly, whose skilled repair work in Batavia had allowed ''Endeavour'' to resume her voyage.<ref>Beaglehole 1968, pp. 449<U+2013>450</ref> The health of the surviving crew members then slowly improved as the month progressed, with the last deaths from disease being three ordinary seamen on 27 February.<ref>Beaglehole 1968, p. 452</ref>

On 13 March 1771, ''Endeavour'' rounded the Cape of Good Hope and made port in [[Cape Town]] two days later. Those still sick were taken ashore for treatment.<ref>Beaglehole 1968, p. 457</ref> The ship remained in port for four weeks awaiting the recovery of the crew and undergoing minor repairs to her masts.<ref>Beaglehole 1968, pp. 460<U+2013>461</ref> On 15 April, the sick were brought back on board along with ten recruits from Cape Town, and ''Endeavour'' resumed her homeward voyage.<ref>Beaglehole 1968, p. 597</ref><ref>Beaglehole 1968, pp. 463<U+2013>466</ref> The English mainland was sighted on 10 July and ''Endeavour'' entered the port of [[Dover]] two days later.<ref>Beaglehole 1968, p. 477</ref>

Approximately one month after his return, Cook was promoted to the rank of [[Commander]], and by November 1771 was in receipt of Admiralty Orders for a [[James Cook#Second voyage (1772<U+2013>75)|second expedition]], this time aboard [[HMS Resolution (1771)|HMS ''Resolution'']].<ref>Hough 1994, p. 217</ref> He was killed during an altercation with native Hawaiians at [[Kealakekua Bay]] on 14 February 1779.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Voyage of the Resolution 1776<U+2013>1780 |publisher=The University of Canterbury, New Zealand |year=2008 |url=http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/voyages/resolution/death.shtml |accessdate =16 November 2008}}</ref>

==Later service==
While Cook was feted for his successful voyage, ''Endeavour'' was largely forgotten. Within a week of her return to England, she was directed to [[Woolwich Dockyard]] for refitting as a naval transport.<ref name="Hough215"/> She then made two routine return voyages to the [[Falkland Islands]], the first to deliver provisions and the second to bring home the British garrison.<ref name="Hough215">Hough 1994, p. 215</ref> She was [[paid off]] in September 1774,<ref>Hosty and Hundley 2003, p. 62</ref> and in March 1775 was sold by the Navy to shipping magnate J. Mather for <U+00A3>645.<ref name="EncyclopediaNZ"/><ref name="CCSupdate">{{cite journal |last=Allan |first=John |title=The Fate of Cook's Ships: Cook's Ships - A Summary Update |journal =Cook's Log |volume=vol. 25 |issue= 3 |page=1929 |publisher=Captain Cook Society |location=United Kingdom |date=2002 |url=http://www.captaincooksociety.com/ccsu7120.htm |accessdate=16 September 2008}}</ref>

Mather renamed the increasingly decrepit ship ''Lord Sandwich''<ref name="CCSupdate"/> and returned her to sea for at least one commercial voyage to [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]] in Russia.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Fate of Cook's Ships: What Do We Know About The Endeavour? - Part 2 |journal=Cook's Log |volume= vol.20 |issue=2 |page=1377 |publisher=Captain Cook Society |location=United Kingdom |date=1997 |url=http://www.captaincooksociety.com/ccsu7113.htm |accessdate=16 September 2008}}</ref> In late 1775, he was asked by the Admiralty to provide one of his ships to transport soldiers to North America to help defeat the [[Militia (United States)#Revolutionary_War (1775-1783)|colonial militia]] during the [[American Revolution]].<ref name="Hosty16-17">Hosty and Hundley 2003, pp. 16<U+2013>17</ref> Mather offered to return the ageing ''Lord Sandwich'' to military service, but her condition was so poor that she was declared unseaworthy.

==Final resting place==
''Endeavour''<U+2019>s end came in August 1778, when the British settlement at [[Narragansett Bay]] was threatened by a fleet carrying French soldiers in support of the colonial militia. The British commander, Captain John Brisbane, determined to blockade the bay by sinking surplus vessels at its mouth. Between 3 and 6 August, a fleet of Royal Navy frigates and transports, including ''Lord Sandwich'', were scuttled at various locations in the Bay.<ref name="Hosty16-17"/>{{ref|scuttle|[e]}}

The owners of the sunken vessels were compensated by the Admiralty for the loss of their ships. The Admiralty valuation for the sunken vessel recorded the specifications of ''Lord Sandwich'' as matching those of the former ''Endeavour'', including construction in Whitby, a burthen of 368 and 71/94&nbsp;tons, and re-entry into Navy service on 10 February 1776.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Abbass |first=D.

In 1834 a letter appeared in the ''[[Providence Journal]]'' of Rhode Island, drawing attention to the possible presence of the former ''Endeavour'' on the seabed of the bay.<ref name="CCS">{{cite web |title=The Fate of Cook's Ships: What Do We Know About The Endeavour? - Part 1 |publisher=Captain Cook Society |year=2008 |url=http://www.captaincooksociety.com/ccsu7112.htm |accessdate=29 August 2008}}</ref> This was swiftly disputed by the British consul in Rhode Island, who wrote claiming that ''Endeavour'' had been bought from Mather by the French in 1790 and renamed ''La Liberte''. The consul later admitted he had heard this not from the Admiralty, but as hearsay from the former owners of the French ship.<ref name="CCS"/> It was later suggested the ''Liberty'', which sank off Newport in 1793, was in fact another of Cook's ships, the former HMS ''Resolution'',<ref>{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Francis |title=Captain Cook's Endeavour found off coast of America |work=The Telegraph (UK) |publisher =Telegraph Media Group Ltd |date=18 May 2006 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/1518741/Captain-Cooks-Endeavour-found-off-coast-of-America.html |accessdate=29 August 2008}}</ref> or another {{HMS|Endeavour|1775|2}}, a naval [[schooner]] sold out of service in 1782.<ref name="CCS"/> A further letter to the ''Providence Journal'' stated that a retired English sailor was conducting guided tours of a [[hulk (ship)|hulk]] on the [[River Thames]] as late as 1825, claiming that the ship had once been Cook's ''Endeavour.''<ref name="CCS"/> 

In 1991 the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project, or RIMAP, began research into the identity of the ten transports sunk as part of the Narragansett Bay blockade, including whether the ''Lord Sandwich'' recorded as having sunk there was originally Cook's ''Endeavour.'' Evidence from the [[Public Records Office]] in London confirmed that ''Endeavour'' had been renamed ''Lord Sandwich'', had served as a troop transport to North America, and had been scuttled as part of the blockade of Narragansett Bay.<ref name="Hosty16-17"/>

In 1999 a combined research team from RIMAP and the Australian National Maritime Museum began examining known wrecks in the Bay, to determine if any could be ''Endeavour''.<ref name="Hosty23-26">Hosty and Hundley 2003, pp. 23<U+2013>26</ref> In 2000, a site was identified containing the remains of one of the blockaded vessels, partly covered by a separate wreck of a twentieth-century barge. The older remains were those of a vessel of the same size, design and materials of ''Lord Sandwich'', the ex-''Endeavour''.<ref name="Hosty23-26"/>

Confirmation that Cook's former ship was indeed in Narragansett Bay sparked considerable media and public interest in confirming her location.<ref>{{cite news |title=Captain Cook's Endeavour 'found' |work=BBC World News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=18 May 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4994614.stm |accessdate=29 August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Shipwreck may be Cook's Endeavour |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=17 May 2006 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200605/s1640502.htm |accessdate=29 August 2008}}</ref>  However, while researchers were able to photograph relics at the site, including a cannon, an anchor and part of an eighteenth-century ceramic teapot, too little evidence existed to definitively establish that this particular wreck had been Cook's ship. In 2006, the Director of RIMAP announced that the wreck would not be raised.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Richard |title=Found, maybe!

==''Endeavour'' relics==
In addition to the search for the remains of the ship herself, there was considerable Australian interest in locating relics of the ship<U+2032>s south Pacific voyage. In 1886, the Working Men's Progress Association of [[Cooktown]] sought to recover the six&nbsp;cannons thrown overboard when ''Endeavour'' grounded on the Great Barrier Reef. A <U+00A3>300 reward was offered for anyone who could locate and recover the guns, but searches that year and the next were fruitless and the money went unclaimed.<ref name="Parkin317"/> Remains of equipment left at Endeavour River were discovered in around 1900, and in 1913 the crew of a merchant steamer erroneously claimed to have recovered an ''Endeavour'' cannon from shallow water near the Reef.<ref>{{cite news| last = |first = |coauthors = |title =Interesting Relics | work =The Advertiser | page = 4 | publisher =J.

In 1937, a small part of ''Endeavour''<U+2019>s keel was gifted to the [[Commonwealth of Australia|Australian Government]] by philanthropist [[Charles Wakefield]] in his capacity as President of the [[Arthur Phillip|Admiral Arthur Phillip Memorial]].<ref name="TCT">{{cite news |title=Cook relics for National Library |work=The Canberra Times |page= 3 |publisher=Federal Capital Press of Australia Ltd |date=16 May 1937 |url=http://ndpbeta.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/2432570?searchTerm=hms+endeavour | accessdate=12 September 2008}}</ref> Australian Prime Minister [[Joseph Lyons]] described the section of keel as "intimately associated with the discovery and foundation of Australia".<ref name="TCT"/> 

Searches were resumed for the lost Endeavour Reef cannons, but expeditions in 1966, 1967, and 1968 were unsuccessful.<ref name="Parkin317"/> They were finally recovered in 1969 by a research team from the American [[Academy of Natural Sciences]],<ref name="ANMM">{{cite web |title=Endeavour cannon |publisher=Australian National Maritime Museum |year=2008 |url=http://www.anmm.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=2&c=34 |accessdate=12 September 2008}}</ref> using a sophisticated [[magnetometer]] to locate the cannons, a quantity of iron ballast and the abandoned bower anchor.
