A cyclone's track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the cancer or subtropical [[jet stream]].

Weather fronts separate two [[air mass|masses of air]] of different [[density|densities]] and are associated with the most prominent [[meteorological phenomenon|meteorological phenomena]]. Air masses separated by a front may differ in [[temperature]] or [[humidity]]. Strong cold fronts typically feature narrow bands of [[thunderstorm]]s and [[severe weather]], and may on occasion be preceded by [[squall line]]s or [[dry line]]s.

[[Warm front]]s form east of the cyclone center and are usually preceded by [[stratiform]] [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[fog]]. They move [[Geographical pole|poleward]] ahead of the cyclone path. Occluded fronts form late in the cyclone life cycle near the center of the cyclone and often wrap around the storm center.

====Extratropical cyclone====
{{main|Extratropical cyclone}}

An '''extratropical cyclone''' is a [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic scale]] [[Low pressure area|low pressure]] weather system that does not have [[tropical cyclone|tropical]] characteristics, being connected with [[Surface weather analysis|fronts]] and horizontal [[gradients]] in [[temperature]] and [[dew point]] otherwise known as "baroclinic zones".<ref name="ExtraLessonMillUni">{{cite web

The descriptor "extratropical" refers to the fact that this type of cyclone generally occurs outside of the tropics, in the middle latitudes of the planet. These systems may also be described as "mid-latitude cyclones" due to their area of formation, or "post-tropical cyclones" where [[Extratropical cyclone#Extratropical transition|extratropical transition]] has occurred,<ref name="ExtraLessonMillUni">ExtraLessonMillUni</ref><ref name="ExtratropicalPhases">{{cite web

=====Polar low=====
{{main|Polar low}}
[[File:Polar low.jpg|thumb|Polar low over the [[Barents Sea]] on February 27, 1987]]
A '''polar low''' is a small-scale, short-lived atmospheric [[low pressure area|low pressure system]] (depression) that is found over the ocean areas poleward of the main [[polar front]] in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Polar lows are cold-core so they can be considered as a subset of extratropical cyclones. Polar lows were first identified on the meteorological satellite imagery that became available in the 1960s, which revealed many small-scale cloud vortices at high latitudes. The most active polar lows are found over certain ice-free maritime areas in or near the Arctic during the winter, such as the Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea, Labrador Sea and Gulf of Alaska. Polar lows dissipate rapidly when they make landfall. Antarctic systems tend to be weaker than their northern counterparts since the air-sea temperature differences around the continent are generally smaller. However, vigorous polar lows can be found over the Southern Ocean.During winter, when cold-core lows with temperatures in the mid-levels of the troposphere reach {{convert|-45|C|F}} move over open waters, deep convection forms which allows [[polar low]] development to become possible.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-tBa1DWYoDIC&pg=PA227|title=Polar lows: mesoscale weather systems in the polar regions|page=224|author=Erik A.

They are part of the larger class of [[mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] weather systems. Polar lows can be difficult to detect using conventional weather reports and are a hazard to high-latitude operations, such as shipping and gas and oil platforms. Polar lows have been referred to by many other terms, such as polar mesoscale vortex, Arctic hurricane, Arctic low, and cold air depression. Today the term is usually reserved for the more vigorous systems that have near-surface winds of at least 17&nbsp;m/s.<ref>{{cite book|author=E. A. Rasmussen and J.

They can form between the equator and the 50th parallel.<ref name = "A6"/> As early as the 1950s, meteorologists were unclear whether they should be characterized as tropical cyclones or extratropical cyclones, and used terms such as quasi-tropical and semi-tropical to describe the cyclone hybrids.<ref>{{cite journal|author=David B.

{{main|Tropical cyclone}}
[[File:2013 Atlantic hurricane season summary map.png|thumbnail|[[2013 Atlantic hurricane season|2013]] Atlantic hurricane season summary map]]
A '''tropical cyclone''' is a [[storm|storm system]] characterized by a [[low pressure system|low pressure]] center and numerous [[thunderstorms]] that produce strong winds and [[flood]]ing [[rain]]. A tropical cyclone feeds on heat released when moist [[air]] rises, resulting in [[condensation]] of [[water vapour]] contained in the moist air. They are fueled by a different heat mechanism than other cyclonic windstorms such as [[nor'easter]]s, [[European windstorm]]s, and [[polar low]]s, leading to their classification as "warm core" storm systems.<ref name = "AOML FAQ A7"/>

The term "tropical" refers to both the geographic origin of these systems, which form almost exclusively in [[tropics|tropical]] regions of the globe, and their formation in [[Air mass#Classification and notation|Maritime Tropical air masses]]. The term "cyclone" refers to such storms' cyclonic nature, with [[Clockwise and counterclockwise|counterclockwise]] rotation in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and clockwise rotation in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Depending on their location and strength, tropical cyclones are referred to by other names, such as hurricane, [[typhoon]], tropical storm, cyclonic storm, tropical depression, or simply as a cyclone. 

While tropical cyclones can produce extremely powerful winds and torrential [[rain]], they are also able to produce high waves and damaging [[storm surge]].<ref name="oxfo">{{cite web|author=James M.

As a result, tropical cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the Earth's [[troposphere]].

Many tropical cyclones [[tropical cyclogenesis|develop]] when the atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance in the atmosphere are favorable. Others form when [[#Related cyclone types|other types of cyclones]] acquire tropical characteristics. Tropical systems are then moved by [[#Steering winds|steering winds]] in the [[troposphere]]; if the conditions remain favorable, the tropical disturbance intensifies, and can even develop an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]]. On the other end of the spectrum, if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall, the system weakens and eventually dissipates. A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses;<ref name = "AOML FAQ A7"/> From an operational standpoint, a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.<ref name=PadgetDecember2000>{{cite web|author = Padgett, Gary|url = http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2001/summ0012.htm|title = Monthly Global Tropical Cyclone Summary for December 2000|year = 2001|accessdate = 2006-03-31}}</ref>

===Upper level types===

====Polar cyclone====
{{main|Polar cyclone}}
A '''polar''', '''sub-polar''', or '''Arctic cyclone''' (also known as a '''polar vortex''')<ref name = "glossvortex"/> is a vast area of low pressure which strengthens in the winter and weakens in the summer.<ref>{{cite web|author=Halld<U+00F3>r Bj<U+00F6>rnsson|date=2005-01-19|url=http://andvari.vedur.is/~halldor/HB/Met210old/GlobCirc.html|title=Global circulation|publisher=Ve<U+00F0>urstofa <U+00CD>slands|accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref> A polar cyclone is a low pressure [[weather system]], usually spanning {{convert|1000|km|mi}} to {{convert|2000|km|mi}}, in which the air circulates in a counterclockwise direction in the northern hemisphere, and a clockwise direction in the southern hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, the polar cyclone has two centers on average. One center lies near Baffin Island and the other over northeast Siberia.<ref name="glossvortex">{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=polar-vortex1|title=Polar vortex|accessdate=2008-06-15|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]}}</ref> In the southern hemisphere, it tends to be located near the edge of the [[Ross ice shelf]] near 160 west longitude.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rui-Rong Chen, Don L.

====TUTT cell====
{{Main|Upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex}}
Under specific circumstances, upper cold lows can break off from the base of the Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough (TUTT), which is located mid-ocean in the Northern Hemisphere during the summer months. These upper tropospheric cyclonic vortices, also known as TUTT cells or TUTT lows, usually move slowly from east-northeast to west-southwest, and generally do not extend below 20,000 feet in altitude. A weak inverted surface trough within the [[trade wind]] is generally found underneath them, and they may also be associated with broad areas of high-level clouds. Downward development results in an increase of [[cumulus clouds]] and the appearance of a surface vortex. In rare cases, they become warm-core, resulting in the vortex becoming a [[tropical cyclone]]. Upper cyclones and upper troughs which trail tropical cyclones can cause additional outflow channels and aid in their intensification process. Developing tropical disturbances can help create or deepen upper troughs or upper lows in their wake due to the outflow jet emanating from the developing tropical disturbance/cyclone.<ref name="CLARK">{{cite web|author = Clark Evans |url = http://flhurricane.com/cyclone/showflat.php?Cat=0&Number=64429&an=0&page=0|title = Favorable trough interactions on tropical cyclones|publisher = Flhurricane.com|date = January 5, 2006|accessdate = 2006-10-20}}</ref><ref name="AMSPAPER">{{cite journal|author = Deborah Hanley, John Molinari, and Daniel Keyser|title = A Composite Study of the Interactions between Tropical Cyclones and Upper-Tropospheric Troughs|month = October|year = 2001|journal = [[Monthly Weather Review]]|publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]]|volume = 129|issue = 10|pages = 2570<U+2013>84|doi = 10.1175/1520-0493(2001)129<2570:ACSOTI>2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 2001MWRv..129.2570H }}</ref>

==Mesoscale==
[[File:Mars cyclone.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Cyclone on Mars, imaged by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]]]

The following types of cyclones are not identifiable in synoptic charts.

===Mesocyclone===
{{main|Mesocyclone}}
A '''mesocyclone''' is a [[vortex]] of air, {{convert|2.0|km|mi}} to {{convert|10|km|mi}} in diameter (the [[mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale of meteorology]]), within a [[convection|convective]] [[storm]].<ref name="MesocyloneDef">{{cite web| title = Mesocyclone|author=Glossary of Meteorology|publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]]|date = June 2000|url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=mesocyclone1|accessdate = 2006-12-07}}</ref>
Air rises and rotates around a vertical axis, usually in the same direction as low pressure systems in both northern and southern hemisphere. They are most often cyclonic, that is, associated with a localized low-pressure region within a [[supercell]].<ref>{{cite web|author=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office State College, Pennsylvania|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/ctp/features/2006/07_10/|title=Splitting Storm and Anti-cyclonic Rotating Mesocyclone in a Thunderstorm over Elk County July 10th, 2006|date=2006-07-16|accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref> Such storms can feature strong surface winds and severe [[hail]]. Mesocyclones often occur together with updrafts in [[supercell]]s, where [[tornado]]es may form. About 1700 mesocyclones form annually across the [[United States]], but only half produce tornadoes.<ref name="FoN">Forces of Nature. [http://library.thinkquest.org/C003603/english/tornadoes/themesocyclone.shtml Tornadoes : the mesocyclone.] Retrieved on 2008-06-15.</ref>

===Tornado===
{{main|Tornado}}

A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. They are often referred to as twisters or cyclones, although the word cyclone is used in meteorology, in a wider sense, to name any closed low pressure circulation.

===Dust devil===
{{main|Dust devil}}

A dust devil is a strong, well-formed, and relatively long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a metre wide and a few metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. Dust devils are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to pose a threat to both people and property.

===Waterspout===
{{main|Waterspout}}

A columnar vortex forming over water connected to a [[cumuliform cloud]].  Similar to a tornado but usually weaker.

===Steam devil===
{{main|Steam devil}}

A gentle vortex over calm water or wet land made visible by rising water vapour.

==Other planets==
Cyclones are not unique to Earth. Cyclonic storms are common on [[gas giant|Jovian planets]], such as the [[Small Dark Spot]] on [[Neptune]]. Also known as the [[Wizard's Eye]], it is about one third the diameter of the [[Great Dark Spot]]. It received the name "Wizard's Eye" because it looks like an eye. This appearance is caused by a white cloud in the middle of the Wizard's Eye.<ref name="WIZ"/> [[Mars]] has also exhibited cyclonic storms.<ref name="Brand">{{cite web|author=David Brand|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/May99/mars.cyclone.deb.html|title=Colossal cyclone swirling near Martian north pole is observed by Cornell-led team on Hubble telescope|accessdate=2008-06-15|date=1999-05-19|publisher=[[Cornell University]]|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070613133949/http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/May99/mars.cyclone.deb.html |archivedate = June 13, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Jovian storms like the [[Great Red Spot]] are usually mistakenly named as giant hurricanes or cyclonic storms. However, this is inaccurate, as the Great Red Spot is, in fact, the inverse phenomenon, an [[anticyclone]].<ref name="HaydPlan">{{cite web
