'''Tuen Mun District''' ({{zh-t|t=<U+5C6F><U+9580><U+5340>}}) is one of the 18 [[districts of Hong Kong|administrative districts]] of [[Hong Kong]]. It is the westernmost continental district of Hong Kong, located about 32 km from the [[Kowloon Peninsula]], 7 km southwest of [[Yuen Long]] and 18 km west of [[Tsuen Wan]]. The population of the district is about 520,000 and is forecast to rise to about 542,000 in 2011. Part of the district is the Tuen Mun New Town, which contains one of the largest residential areas in the [[New Territories]].

==History==
According to [[archaeologist]]s, fishermen started settling in Tuen Mun since the [[New Stone Age]]. As a result, the predominant activities in Tuen Mun were fishing and agriculture during the 20th century. In the 1950s, [[pirate]] and [[smuggling]] activities were frequent.

Originally named Castle Peak New Town when planning, the new town was finally named Tuen Mun, adopting the historic name of the region.  ''Tuen Mun'' in the [[Chinese language]] means a gateway where military is stationed. The new town was built on [[land reclamation|reclaimed land]] from the [[Castle Peak Bay]], starting from the late 1970s. The district was subsequently named Tuen Mun after its establishment in the early 1980s.

==Transport==
It takes about 40 minutes by [[Transportation in Hong Kong|public transport]] to travel to Tuen Mun from downtown areas of Hong Kong such as [[Tsim Sha Tsui]] and [[Central and Western district|Central]].

===Rail===
[[Image:StrassenbahnGleisplanTuenMun1996.png|thumb|map of the KCR Light Rail]]
The first [[rapid transit]] line serving the district, [[KCR]] [[West Rail (KCRC)|West Rail]], went into service in [[December 2003]], connecting Tuen Mun with [[Kowloon]]. It takes 30 minutes to travel between the termini, Tuen Mun and [[Nam Cheong]] ([[Sham Shui Po]]) in [[Kowloon]]. There is another station, [[Siu Hong (KCRC)|Siu Hong]], located in the northern part of Tuen Mun. Both stations are connected by the [[Light Rail (KCRC)|KCR Light Rail]] (LRT) service.

The KCR Light Rail, which has been in service since 1988, is a light rail system which connects the two district in North West New Territories: Tuen Mun and Yuen Long.

===Road transport===
In the past, before its development into a new town, traffic between Tuen Mun and the city ([[Tsuen Wan]]) depended solely on [[Castle Peak Road]]. In 1977, [[Tuen Mun Road]] (Phase 1) was built. It was the first highway ever built in Hong Kong. Although the new highway facilitates transportation between Tuen Mun and the city, any traffic accident on the highway, regardless of magnitude, usually results in serious traffic congestion. Much of the road is built on concrete pillars, and the highway has many sharp bends, as it follows the mountain coastline along the sea. As a matter of fact, the highway is notorious for serious traffic accidents, being regarded as one of the most dangerous highways in Hong Kong, and having the highest accident rate. Tuen Mun Road holds the sordid record as host to the deadliest traffic accident in the history of Hong Kong; on the [[10 July|10th of July]] [[2003]], 21 people died when a lorry cut off a bus travelling towards Tuen Mun in the lane closest to the flyover edge, resulting in the bus driver losing control and veering over the edge, and onto the mountainside below.

===Ferry===
In the near future, Tuen Mun will also be linked to the neighbour cities in the [[Pearl River Delta]] such as [[Macau]] and [[Zhuhai]] in China by the ferry travelling to and from [[Tuen Mun Ferry Pier]].

===River Trade Terminal===
The trade terminal is operated by [http://www.rttc.com.hk/ River Trade Terminal Co. Ltd.], and is located in the Tuen Mun Area 38. It covers an area of 650,000 m<U+00B2>. Operations commenced on 14 October 1998. <ref>[http://www.rttc.com.hk/ River Trade Terminal Co. Ltd.]</ref>
