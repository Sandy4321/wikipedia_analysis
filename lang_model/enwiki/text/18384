The '''1998 Pacific hurricane season''' was a moderately active [[Pacific hurricane]] season with seven [[tropical cyclone]]s directly affecting land. The season officially started on [[May 15]] in the eastern Pacific, and on [[June 1]] in the central Pacific, and ended on [[November 30]]; these dates conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern [[Pacific Ocean]]. The first tropical cyclone developed on [[June 11]], which was about ten days later than the normal start of the season.<ref name="agathatcr">{{cite web|author=Lixion A. Avila|year=1998|title=Tropical Storm Agatha Preliminary Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-02-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998agatha.html}}</ref> The final storm of the year, Hurricane Madeline, dissipated on [[October 20]]. Storm activity in the [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center|Central Pacific Ocean]] was low, with just one tropical depression forming in the basin. Two tropical cyclones from the Eastern Pacific, Darby and Estelle, also entered the central Pacific, with the former entering as a hurricane.

The season produced 13 named storms, which was slightly below the average of 16&nbsp;named storms per season. However, the total of nine hurricanes during the season was equal to the average, and the total of six [[tropical cyclone scales|major hurricanes]] surpassed the average.<ref name="climo">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2007|title=Tropical Cyclone Climatology|accessdate=2007-02-25|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastprofile.shtml}}</ref>

The most notable tropical cyclone was [[Hurricane Isis (1998)|Hurricane Isis]], which killed fourteen people when it made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on southern [[Baja California Sur|Baja California]] and coastal [[Sinaloa]] in [[Mexico]]. Isis caused moderate damage in the nation, destroying more than 700&nbsp;homes and damaging dozens of cars.<ref name="ap9055">{{cite news|author=Associated Press|date=1998-09-05|title=At least 10 dead from Hurricane Isis|accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref> It later produced light rainfall and caused dozens of traffic accidents in the southwestern [[United States]]. In addition to Isis, Tropical Storm Javier made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on [[Mexico]]; the nation experienced the effects of other offshore storms, with six tropical cyclones having some impact on the country. One tropical cyclone, Hurricane Lester, affected [[Central America]], and caused two deaths in [[Guatemala]]. Three tropical cyclones produced light to moderate rainfall across the southwestern [[United States]], and one hurricane produced rough surf along the coast of [[California]]. Hurricane Madeline contributed to a costly and deadly flood in southern [[Texas]].

A poorly defined [[tropical wave]] crossed [[Central America]] into the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] on [[June 8]]. As it tracked westward under the influence of a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to its north, a broad circulation developed. However, convection remained sporadic and well-removed from smaller surface centers embedded in the system. Gradually, a dominant center of circulation became better defined, with increasingly organized convection and developing [[tropical cyclone#structure|banding features]].<ref name="agathatcr">{{cite web|author=Lixion A. Avila|year=1998|title=Tropical Storm Agatha Preliminary Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-02-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998agatha.html}}</ref> By early on [[June 11]], the center became sufficiently associated with the convection for the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) to classify the system as Tropical Depression One-E. This occurred while the area of unsettled weather was about 460&nbsp;miles (765&nbsp;km) south-southwest of [[Acapulco]], [[Mexico]].<ref name="td1edisc1">{{cite web|author=Guiney & Pasch|year=1998|title=Tropical Depression One-E Discussion One|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-02-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/dis/NEP0198.001}}</ref> 

The center of the depression was not initially well defined, with restricted [[tropical cyclone#structure|outflow]] in the eastern half of the circulation.<ref name="td1edisc1"/> As such, the depression failed to attain any significant organization in the days subsequent to its formation. Later, an approaching tropical wave merged with the depression, resulting in a trend of intensification and increased organization. By [[June 13]], the NHC upgraded the depression to [[tropical storm]] status, and gave it the name "Agatha". Agatha was about 650&nbsp;miles (1050&nbsp;km) south-southeast of [[Cabo San Lucas]] when it became a tropical storm.<ref name="agathatcr"/> As Agatha became a tropical storm, forecasters predicted that it would not strengthen further, due to its forecasted track passing over cooler waters.<ref name="agathadisc8">{{cite web|author=Jarvinen|year=1998|title=Tropical Storm Agatha Discussion Eight|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-02-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/dis/NEP0198.008}}</ref> However, Agatha quickly strengthened, developing a curved band of [[convection]] wrapping around its center,<ref name="agathadisc11">{{cite web|author=Avila|year=1998|title=Tropical Storm Agatha Discussion Eleven|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-02-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/dis/NEP0198.011}}</ref> and early on [[June 11]] it attained a peak intensity of 65&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) while about 615&nbsp;miles (985&nbsp;km) southwest of the southern tip of [[Baja California Peninsula|Baja California]]. Agatha maintained peak winds for about 12&nbsp;hours before moving over colder waters and gradually weakening. On [[June 15]], it degenerated back into a tropical depression, and a day later, it dissipated over the open waters of the Pacific Ocean. The storm never affected land.<ref name="agathatcr"/>

A few days later, another westward-moving tropical disturbance paralleled the southern coast of [[Central America]] and [[Mexico]]. Convection in the area organized steadily, and late on [[June 19]], the system developed into Tropical Depression Two-E about 260&nbsp;miles (420&nbsp;km) south-southwest of [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], [[Mexico]]. On becoming a tropical depression, the system maintained a large, elongated, low-level circulation with some [[tropical cyclone#structure|banding features]] and restricted [[tropical cyclone#structure|outflow]] due to [[wind shear]]. The [[National Hurricane Center]] first predicted that the depression would intensify, reaching winds of 50&nbsp;mph (80&nbsp;km/h), though two [[Tropical cyclone prediction model|computer models]] projected it to quickly dissipate. Under the influence of a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] over Mexico, the depression moved to the west-northwest,<ref name="td2edisc1">{{cite web|author=Guiney & Avila|year=1998|title=Tropical Depression Two-E Discussion One|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-02-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/dis/NEP0298.001}}</ref> and, under the influence of increasing wind shear, the depression failed to organize significantly. By [[June 20]], the circulation center was partially exposed, and was located to the northeast of the primary convection<U+2014>traits that signal a weak storm.

On [[June 8]], a [[tropical wave]] emerged off the coast of [[Africa]]. The wave remained weak and  nondescript as it crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and entered the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] on [[June 19]]. An area of convection developed and organized along the wave's axis, and the National Hurricane Center began to employ [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak classifications]] on [[June 20]]. Convective [[tropical cyclone#physical structure|banding features]] increased as the broad circulation became better defined, and on [[June 22]], the disturbance developed into Tropical Depression Three-E about 575&nbsp;miles (925&nbsp;km) south of the [[Gulf of Tehuantepec]]. Well-defined steering currents resulted in a general west-northwestward movement. Deep convection concentrated near the center, and about 12&nbsp;hours after becoming a tropical depression, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Blas about 400&nbsp;miles (640&nbsp;km) south of [[Puerto Angel, Mexico]].<ref name="blastcr">{{cite web|author=Max Mayfield|year=1998|title=Hurricane Blas Preliminary Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-02-17|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998blas.html}}</ref>

Tropical Storm Blas continued to organize as it moved parallel to the [[Mexico|Mexican]] coast. Banding features increased, and on [[June 23]] the storm attained [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|hurricane status]] about 345&nbsp;miles (555&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Acapulco]]. The next day, an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] developed and became apparent on satellite imagery, while [[tropical cyclone#physical structure|upper-level outflow]] became better defined. Blas quickly strengthened and reached its peak intensity on [[June 25]], with maximum sustained winds of 140&nbsp;mph (225&nbsp;km/h), while about 575&nbsp;miles (925&nbsp;km) south-southeast of the southern tip of [[Baja California Peninsula|Baja California]]. Temperatures warmed in the convection around the eye, though the eye remained visible for several days as Blas turned west under the influence of a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to its north. On [[June 28]], it degenerated into a tropical storm after entering an area of cooler water. Blas weakened to a tropical depression on [[June 30]], and a day later was considered to have dissipated due to a lack of convection near the center. A remnant low-level cloud swirl persisted for several days, passing well to the south of [[Hawaii]] on [[July 5]] before dissipating. The [[Associated Press]] attributed 4&nbsp;deaths from a [[mudslide]] in [[Michoac<U+00E1>n]] to Blas. However, as the primary convection remained offshore, the National Hurricane Center did not consider the deaths related to the hurricane.<ref name="blastcr"/> The threat of Blas prompted officials in [[Acapulco]] to close the port to all navigation.<ref name="aj623">{{cite news|author=Atlanta Journal|date=1998-06-23|title=Storm likely to become hurricane|accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref>

On [[July 1]], another [[tropical wave]] emerged off the coast of [[Africa]]. It moved westward due to strong [[wind shear]] without further organization, and crossed [[Central America]] into the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] on [[July 11]]. An area of organizing [[convection]] developed along the wave axis, and [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak classifications]] began on [[July 13]]<!--people began them-who?-->, while the tropical wave was south of the [[Gulf of Tehuantepec]]. The cloud pattern soon became disorganized, and the area of disturbed weather continued west-northwestward. On [[July 16]], convection increased and organized into [[tropical cyclone#structure|banding features]]; early on [[July 17]], the system developed into Tropical Depression Four-E about 150&nbsp;miles (240&nbsp;km) south of [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo, Mexico]]. Soon after becoming a tropical depression, the storm rapidly organized and intensified into Tropical Storm Celia six hours after becoming a tropical depression. The tropical storm initially moved northwestward, and briefly threatened southern [[Baja California Sur|Baja California]]. As a result, the government of [[Mexico]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] on [[July 18]] for [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]] southward. Shortly thereafter, a mid- to upper-level [[anticyclone]] turned Celia to the west-northwest and forced it to pass about 150&nbsp;miles (240&nbsp;km) south-southwest of [[Cabo San Lucas]]. On [[July 19]], Celia attained maximum sustained winds of 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h) before moving over cooler waters and diminishing in convection. The storm degenerated into a tropical depression on [[July 20]], and Celia dissipated early on [[July 21]], well away from the Mexican coastline.<ref name="celiatcr">{{cite web|author=Richard Pasch|year=1999|title=Tropical Storm Celia Preliminary Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-02-26|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998celia.html}}</ref>

A [[tropical wave]] moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on [[July 4]]. It tracked westward across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] with little increase in [[convection]], and crossed [[Central America]] into the [[Pacific Ocean]] on [[July 16]]. Three days later, convection began to increase along the wave axis while the wave was well to the south of [[Acapulco]], [[Mexico]]. On [[July 21]], [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak classifications]] began as the cloud pattern displayed curvature on satellite images. Convective [[tropical cyclone#structure|banding features]] gradually developed, and it is estimated that the system organized into Tropical Depression Five-E early on [[July 23]] about 720&nbsp;miles (1160&nbsp;km) south of the southern tip of the [[Baja California peninsula]]. Under the influence of a mid- to upper-level [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to its north, the depression tracked west-northwestward. Convection became more concentrated as [[tropical cyclone#structure|outflow]] organized further, and 18 hours after the depression first developed, it intensified into Tropical Storm Darby.<ref name="darbytcr">{{cite web|author=Rappaport|year=1999|title=Hurricane Darby Preliminary Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-02-25|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998darby.html}}</ref>

On [[July 18]], a [[tropical wave]] exited the western coast of [[Africa]], and moved westward across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] with sporadic convection but no development. The wave moved across the [[Caribbean Sea]] and the southern [[Gulf of Mexico]] before crossing [[Central America]] into the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] on [[July 28]]. Early on [[July 29]], [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak classifications]] began on the system, and subsequent to the formation of [[tropical cyclone#structure|banding features]] and a surface circulation, the system developed into Tropical Depression Six-E about 170&nbsp;miles (275&nbsp;km) southeast of [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo, Mexico]]. The depression continued to organize, with increasing [[convection]] and distinct upper-level [[tropical cyclone#structure|outflow]], and early on [[July 30]] the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Estelle.<ref name="estelletcr">{{cite web|author=Guiney|year=1999|title=Hurricane Estelle Preliminary Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-02-26|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998estelle.html}}</ref>

Tropical Storm Estelle gradually intensified as it tracked west-northwestward, a motion caused by a large [[anticyclone]] to its north. On [[July 31]], the storm attained hurricane status about 550&nbsp;miles (885&nbsp;km) south-southeast of the southern tip of [[Baja California Peninsula|Baja California]]. Its intensification continued as a well-defined [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] about 30&nbsp;miles (48&nbsp;km) in diameter became visible on satellite imagery, and on [[August 2]] Estelle reached its peak intensity of 135&nbsp;mph (215&nbsp;km/h). The hurricane soon began to weaken as deep convection diminished and the eye disappeared on satellite imagery. Two days after peaking in intensity, Estelle weakened to tropical storm status. Late on [[August 4]], the convection associated with the storm dissipated, and the next day the storm weakened to tropical depression status. Convection briefly re-developed on [[August 6]], though increased [[wind shear]] and cooler water weakened the depression further. Two days later, Estelle dissipated about 400&nbsp;miles (645&nbsp;km) east-northeast of the [[Hawaiian Islands]].<ref name="estelletcr"/> High surf from Estelle impacted southern [[California]], resulting in a number of lifeguard rescues.<ref name="kcal804">{{cite news|author=KCAL-TV|date=1998-08-04|title=Hurricane Estelle is hitting hard|accessdate=2007-02-26}}</ref> The storm disrupted the [[trade wind]]s around [[Hawaii]], resulting in light winds and rain showers on [[Kauai]] and [[Oahu]].<ref name="cphc">{{cite web|author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|year=1999|title=1998 Central Pacific Tropical Cyclone Season|accessdate=2007-02-18|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/1998.php}}</ref>

An area of convection developed in association with a northward bulge of the near-equatorial [[convergence zone]].

A [[tropical wave]] moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on [[August 7]]. As it moved across the [[Atlantic Ocean]], it failed to organize. On reaching the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] on [[August 17]], however, an area of [[convection]] developed along the wave axis. [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak classifications]] began the next day, and a broad center of circulation gradually formed. Convection was intermittent at first, though it gradually organized and persisted near the center, and on [[August 20]], the disturbance developed into Tropical Depression Nine-E about 345&nbsp;miles south of [[Puerto Angel, Mexico]]. It tracked generally west-northwestward, developing more pronounced [[tropical cyclone#structure|banding feature]]s, and on [[August 21]], the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Howard. The center of Howard became embedded within the deep convection, and the storm quickly strengthened to attain hurricane status late on the 21st. An [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] developed as [[tropical cyclone#structure|outflow]] organized further, and Howard began to [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensify]] to reach peak winds of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h) about 600&nbsp;miles (965&nbsp;km) south-southeast of the southern tip of [[Baja California Peninsula|Baja California]].

Shortly after peaking in intensity, the eye of Hurricane Howard gradually became larger, resulting in a slight weakening trend. After weakening to winds of 125&nbsp;mph (200&nbsp;km/h),<ref name="howardtcr"/> the eye reached a diameter of about 30 miles (50&nbsp;km), and the structure of the hurricane transitioned into that of an [[annular hurricane]], similar to that of Darby earlier in the season.<ref name="annular">{{cite web|author=John A.

Javier is believed to have originated from a [[tropical wave]] that moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on [[August 22]]. A convective disturbance along the northern portion of the wave developed into Atlantic [[Hurricane Danielle (1998)|Hurricane Danielle]] on [[August 24]], while the southern portion of the wave axis continued westward. The wave remained inactive and difficult to track as it crossed the Atlantic. On [[September 3]], an area of convection began to develop near [[Acapulco]], at the same time and location where the wave would have been based on extrapolation. The disturbance became better defined on [[September 5]] as it tracked west-northwestward, and on [[September 6]] the convection became sufficiently organized and persistent for the [[National Hurricane Center]] to classify it as Tropical Depression Eleven-E, while it was located about 200&nbsp;miles (330&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo, Mexico]].<ref name="javiertcr">{{cite web|author=Edward N. Rappaport|year=1999|title=Tropical Storm Javier Preliminary Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-02-13|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998javier.html}}</ref>

Easterly [[wind shear]] initially dislocated the circulation center to the eastern edge of the convection. The [[subtropical ridge]] to its north resulted in a general west-northwest motion,<ref name="td11disc1">{{cite web|author=Pasch|year=1998|title=Tropical Depression Eleven Discussion One|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-02-13|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/dis/NEP1198.001}}</ref> and the depression slowly intensified into Tropical Storm Javier late on [[September 7]]. [[Tropical cyclone#structure|Banding feature]]s in the system did not organize significantly, and on [[September 8]], Javier attained a peak intensity of 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h), which coincided with a sharp increase in convection over the center. Steering currents soon weakened, and the storm turned to the east while convection quickly decreased. By [[September 9]], the center was exposed from the diminishing deep convection, and that night it degenerated into a tropical depression. On [[September 11]], the [[National Hurricane Center]] issued its final advisory on Javier, though later analysis indicates that it remained a tropical cyclone as it turned southeastward. At times, it became difficult to distinguish Javier from the broader area of disturbed weather that persisted over the tropical eastern Pacific, though a brief increase in convection and a ship report of winds exceeding 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h) indicate that Javier strengthened again into a tropical storm late on [[September 12]]. It turned to the northeast, and reached winds of 50&nbsp;mph (80&nbsp;km/h) before weakening due to waning convection. Javier made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] about 35&nbsp;miles (55&nbsp;km) east-southeast of [[Cabo Corrientes]] early on [[September 14]], and dissipated within 12 hours of moving ashore. The National Hurricane Center advised small craft along coastal areas of Mexico to monitor the progress of the storm.<ref name="javiertcr"/> Javier produced moderate rainfall along coastal regions of Mexico, including a 24-hour peak of 7.36&nbsp;inches (187&nbsp;mm) in [[Colima]], 6.69&nbsp;inches (170&nbsp;mm) in [[Michoac<U+00E1>n]], and 3.34&nbsp;inches (85&nbsp;mm) in [[Jalisco]].

A small, low-level circulation separated itself from the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] on [[October 10]], several hundred miles southwest of [[Baja California Peninsula|Baja California]].

On [[October 12]], the convection increased greatly, and the system was sufficiently organized to be classified Tropical Depression Thirteen-E early on [[October 13]], about 715&nbsp;miles (1150&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Cabo San Lucas]]. [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak classifications]] also indicated winds of about 35&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;km/h).

A [[tropical wave]] moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on [[September 29]], and on [[October 5]], an area of convection along the wave developed into Atlantic [[1998 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Lisa|Hurricane Lisa]]. The wave axis continued westward, and after crossing [[Central America]] a low-level circulation developed on [[October 13]], about 170&nbsp;miles (275&nbsp;km) south of the border between [[El Salvador]] and [[Guatemala]]. Convection increased as it tracked northwestward, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on [[October 15]], about 200&nbsp;miles (320&nbsp;km) south of Guatemala. It moved northwestward through an area favorable to development, and late on the 15th it intensified into Tropical Storm Lester, about 115&nbsp;miles (185&nbsp;km/h) south of the border of [[Mexico]] and Guatemala. Lester generally paralleled the southern coast of Mexico for the next several days, attaining hurricane status late on [[October 16]]. As a 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) hurricane, the storm made its closest approach to land on [[October 18]], about 70&nbsp;miles (110&nbsp;km) south of [[Puerto Angel, Oaxaca]]. Lester continued westward and gradually moved away from Mexico due to a persistent [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to its north, and after remaining at moderate intensity for five days, it strengthened to reach a peak intensity of 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h) on [[October 22]], about 355&nbsp;miles (570&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Manzanillo, Colima]]. Coinciding with its peak intensity, a short-wave [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] caused Lester to stall before turning to the southwest and weakening. Late on [[October 13]], it degenerated into a tropical storm, and several days later, after resuming its motion to the northwest, Lester dissipated on [[October 26]], about 500&nbsp;miles (805&nbsp;km) southwest of the southern tip of [[Baja California Peninsula]].<ref name="lestertcr">{{cite web|author=Miles B.

The table on the right shows the [[Accumulated Cyclone Energy]] (ACE) for each storm in the 1998 season. The ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of a storm multiplied by its duration, so longer-lived hurricanes have higher ACEs. The total ACE for the season was 133.97 <U+00D7> 10<sup>4</sup> kt<sup>2</sup>.  Because several storms in 1998 were long-lasting or intense, the season's ACE was near-normal.<ref name="ACE">{{cite web|author=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|publisher=[[NOAA]]|year=2005|accessdate=2006-08-10|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/2005/ann/ace-epac-nov30.png|title=East North Pacific ACE: 1949<U+2014>2005}}</ref> Hurricane Howard had the highest ACE, measuring 29.27 x 10<sup>4</sup> kt<sup>2</sup>.

==1998 storm names==
The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1998. No names were retired, so the list was used again in the [[2004 Pacific hurricane season|2004 season]] (and had been used before, in the [[1992 Pacific hurricane season|1992 season]]). No central Pacific storms occurred; the first to develop would have been named Upana. Names that were not assigned are in <font color="gray">gray</font>.
