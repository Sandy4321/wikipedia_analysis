==Academic career==

Rice has spent most of his career in [[academia]], first appointed to the faculty of the [[University of Rhode Island]] (URI) in October 1987.  His academic research interests are in the area of [[environmental physiology]] and [[ecology]] of [[bivalve molluscs]],<ref>Rice, M.A. (2007).  Bivalvia.  pp. 141-144  In: Vol. 3, McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, 10th Edition.  McGraw-Hill, New York. [http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=085800 Web Access]</ref> and he has further research interests in the field of [[aquaculture]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uri.edu/cels/favs/FAV_Mrice.html |title= Michael A. Rice Biography Page, University of Rhode Island |accessdate=2009-January-31}}</ref>  His major contributions have been the demonstration that bivalve mollusks have the ability to absorb [[amino acids]] directly from seawater as a nutrition source, and that bivalves serve an important role in mediating the [[nitrogen cycle|cycling of nitrogen]] and other nutrients within [[marine ecosystems]]. Additionally, he has studied the effects of shellfishing on the [[population ecology]] of bivalves.   His research has led to refinements to the practice of managing shellfishery resources in coastal waters, [[estuary|estuaries]] and [[marine protected areas]].<ref>Rice, M.A., A. Valliere, and A.
