'''Marion duPont Scott''' (1894-1983) was an [[United States|American]] [[philanthropist]], internationally renowned [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse breeding|horsebreeder]] and the last owner of [[Montpelier (James Madison)|Montpelier]], the mansion and land estate of former United States President [[James Madison]]. At the time of her death, Mrs. Scott bequeathed Montpelier to the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] as a national landmark open to the general public, with the condition that the Madison home (which had been expanded to 55 rooms by the du Pont family) be restored to its original 22 room state as a historic landmark. 

While the [[Du Pont family|Du Pont family]] usually spell the family name as "du Pont," Marion and her brother [[William duPont, Jr.]] spelled it conjoined.

Mrs. Scott's important collection of books and periodicals on the history and practice of equestrian and related sports was donated to the [[University of Virginia|University of Virginia's]] Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library with an endowment fund to maintain and expand the collection. Her famous 'red room' with decorations and furniture at Montpelier, although removed permanently from Montpelier during restoration, was moved to Montpelier's visitor center where it is open for viewing by the general public. The visitor center also displays several walls of photographs from Mrs. duPont Scott's distinguished [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing]] career. She was married briefly to Hollywood actor [[Randolph Scott]]. 

==Thoroughbred and Steeplechase Racing==
In 1934, Mrs. Scott and her brother William duPont, Jr. founded the Montpelier Steeplechase Hunt Races, which are held at the Montpelier horse racing [[steeplechase]] course (which Montpelier overlooks) the first Saturday in November each year (a National Steeplechase Association event). The graves and tombstones of three of her beloved racehorses lie off to the left of Montpelier Mansion. Two of these are sons of [[Man o' War]], [[Battleship (horse)|Battleship]] and Annapolis. Battleship is the only horse in history to win both the [[American Grand National]] and the [[Grand National|English Grand National]] [[steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase races]]. Among her other horses, Mrs. Scott also owned [[Mongo (horse)|Mongo]] who was voted the 1963 [[American Champion Male Turf Horse]].

Following the creation of the [[Eclipse Award]]s in 1971, Mrs. Scott's horse [[Soothsayer]] was voted the 1972 [[Eclipse Award for Outstanding Steeplechase horse|American Champion Steeplechase Horse]] and in 1977 [[Proud Delta]] was voted [[American Champion Older Female Horse]]. Mrs. Scott was the recipient of the Thoroughbred Breeders of Kentucky Award in 1973, and in 1981 was voted the [[National Turf Writers Association]] [[Joe Palmer Award]] for meritorious service and outstanding achievement in racing.

[[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech's]] Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center in [[Leesburg, Virginia]], was created in 1984 through a gift from Mrs. Scott. The center is a full-service [[equine]] [[hospital]] that offers advanced specialty care, 24 hour emergency treatment and diagnostic services for all ages and breeds of horses. The hospital sees approximately three thousand patients annually, and employs one hundred twenty equine healthcare professionals.
