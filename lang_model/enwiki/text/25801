'''''Led Zeppelin II''''' is the second [[studio album]] by English [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Led Zeppelin]], released 22 October 1969 on [[Atlantic Records]]. Recording sessions for the album took place at several locations in the United Kingdom and North America from January to August 1969. Production was entirely credited to lead guitarist and songwriter [[Jimmy Page]], while it also served as Led Zeppelin's first album to utilise the recording techniques of engineer [[Eddie Kramer]]. The album furthered the lyrical themes established on their debut album, ''[[Led Zeppelin (album)|Led Zeppelin]]'' (1969). This progress helped create a work that became more widely acclaimed and influential than its predecessor. With elements of [[blues]] and [[folk music]], it also exhibits the band's evolving musical style of blues-derived material and their [[guitar]] and [[riff]]-based sound.

Upon release, ''Led Zeppelin II'' earned a considerable amount of sales and served as Led Zeppelin's first album to reach number 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. It also sold over 500,000 copies in its first year of release. In 1970, the album was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package]]. On 15 November 1999, it was certified [[RIAA certification|duodecuple platinum]] in sales by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), following sales in excess of twelve million copies. Following its initial reception, it has been recognized by writers and music critics as one of the greatest and most influential rock albums recorded. ''Led Zeppelin II'' has also been cited by critics as a blueprint for 1970s hard rock. In 2003, the album was ranked number 75 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].

==Conception==
===Background===
''Led Zeppelin II'' was conceived during a hectic and much-traveled period of the Led Zeppelin's career from January through August 1969, when they completed four [[Europe]]an and three [[North America|American]] [[Led Zeppelin concert tour chronology|concert tours]].<ref name="rosen"/> Each song was separately recorded, mixed and produced at various studios in the United Kingdom and the United States. The album was literally written on the road and, during periods of a couple of hours in between concerts, a studio was booked and the recording process begun, resulting in a sound with spontaneity and urgency through necessity.<ref name="rosen">{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Craig|year=1996|title=The Billboard Book of Number One Albums: The Inside Story Behind Pop Music's Blockbuster Records|edition=1st|location=New York|publisher=Billboard Books|page=118|isbn=0-8230-7586-9}}</ref> Some of the recording studios used by the band were not the most advanced. One studio in [[Vancouver]], credited as "a hut",<ref name="mixing">Cleveland, Barry.[http://www.guitarplayer.com/article/mixing-led-zeppelin/May-08/36033 Guitar Player: Mixing Led Zeppelin II]. New Bay Media, LLC. Retrieved on 2009-02-11.</ref> had an eight-track set up that did not even have proper headphone facilities.<ref name = Complete/><ref name=Schulps>Schulps, Dave. [http://www.iem.ac.ru/zeppelin/docs/interviews/page_77.trp Interview with Jimmy Page], ''[[Trouser Press]]'', October 1977.</ref> 

The group's lead singer [[Robert Plant]] later discussed the writing and recording process, stating "It was crazy really. We were writing the numbers in hotel rooms and then we'd do a rhythm track in London, add the vocal in New York, overdub the harmonica in Vancouver and then come back to finish mixing at New York."<ref name=lewispallett>Lewis, Dave and Pallett, Simon (1997) ''Led Zeppelin: The Concert File'', London: Omnibus Press. ISBN 0-7119-5307-4, p. 32.</ref> "Thank You", "The Lemon Song" and "Moby Dick" were overdubbed during the tour, while the [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] of "Whole Lotta Love" and "Heartbreaker" was also done on tour. Guitarist, songwriter and producer [[Jimmy Page]] later stated "In other words, some of the material came out of rehearsing for the next tour and getting new material together."<ref name = Schulps />

===Recording===
Recording sessions for the album took place at Olympic and Morgan Studios in [[London, England]], A&M, Quantum, Sunset, Mirror Sound and Mystic Studios in [[Los Angeles, California]], Ardent Studios in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], A&R, Juggy Sound, Groove and Mayfair Studios in [[New York City]], and a "hut" in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]].<ref name="mixing"/> The album was Led Zeppelin's first record to utilise the skills of recording engineer [[Eddie Kramer]], whose prior work with [[Jimi Hendrix]] had impressed the band's members, especially Page. Led Zeppelin expert Dave Lewis wrote of the album's production, stating "That the album turned out to be such a triumph, in particular for a production quality that still sounds fresh today, was in no small way due to the successful alliance with Page and Kramer in the control room."<ref name = Complete/> Kramer and Page formed a strong partnership, as exhibited in the central section of the track "Whole Lotta Love". Kramer later said, "The famous Whole Lotta Love mix, where everything is going bananas, is a combination of Jimmy and myself just flying around on a small console twiddling every knob known to man."<ref name = Complete/> In another interview, Kramer later gave great credit to Page for the sound that was achieved, despite the inconsistent conditions in which it was recorded, stating "We did that album piece-meal. We cut some of the tracks in some of the most bizarre studios you can imagine, little holes in the wall. Cheap studios. But in the end it sounded bloody marvellous. There was a unification of sound on ''[Led] Zeppelin II'' because there was one guy in charge and that was Mr. Page."<ref name=theirtime>"Their Time is Gonna Come", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', 2008, p. 21.</ref> Page and Kramer spent two days mixing the album at A&R Studios.<ref name =theirtime/>

==Album sleeve design==
The album sleeve design was from a poster by David Juniper, who was simply told by the band to come up with an idea that was "interesting". His design was based on an old photograph of the [[Jasta 11]] Division of the [[Luftwaffe|German Air Force]] during [[World War I]], the famed [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War 1)|Flying Circus]] led by [[Manfred von Richthofen]], the [[Red Baron]].<ref name = Complete/> After the picture was tinted, the faces of the four members of the band were airbrushed on from a 1969 publicity photograph, as well as the faces of band manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] and tour manager [[Richard Cole]].<ref name = Complete/> The woman in the picture is [[Glynis Johns]], the mother from ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''. Her presence in the photo is an obvious play on the name of recording engineer [[Glyn Johns]]. The other face added was that of bluesman [[Blind Willie Johnson]]. The cover also pictured the outline of a Zeppelin on a brown background, which gave the album its nickname "Brown Bomber".<ref name = Complete/>

==Music==

The finished tracks reflect the raw, evolving sound of the band and their ability as live performers. The album has been noted for featuring a further development of the lyrical themes established on their debut album, creating a work which would become more widely acclaimed and arguably more influential.<ref name="allmusicguide">[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:he61mpc39f8o allmusic: Led Zeppelin II].

Retrieved on 2009-02-09.</ref> ''Led Zeppelin II'' also features experimentation with other musical styles and approaches, as on the alternately soft-and-loud "[[What Is and What Should Never Be]]" and "[[Ramble On]]" (which featured Page's [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]]), or the pop-influenced ballad "[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]". With its mysterious atmospherics, "Ramble On" helped develop hard rock's association with [[fantasy]] themes, which had been partly derived from the [[psychedelic rock]] genre of two to three years before, but also from lyricist Robert Plant's personal interest in the writings of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].<ref name = Complete/> This musical direction would later culminate on the band's [[Led Zeppelin IV|untitled fourth album]] (and countless subsequent groups would later carry the influence to further extremes). Conversely, the instrumental "[[Moby Dick (song)|Moby Dick]]" features an extended drum solo by [[John Bonham]], which would be extended further during [[Led Zeppelin concert tour chronology|Led Zeppelin concert]] performances.<ref name = Complete/>

[[Jimmy Page]]'s contribution to this album was significant, as his [[electric guitar]] solo on the song "Heartbreaker" was emulated by many younger rock guitarists, and exemplifies the group's intense musical attack.<ref name = Complete/> ''Led Zeppelin II'' is the band's first album to feature Page playing a 1959 [[Gibson Les Paul]], the electric guitar he helped make famous. Page's innovative recording and drum [[microphone#microphone techniques|miking]] effects on tracks such as "Ramble On" and "Whole Lotta Love" also demonstrated his considerable skill, resourcefulness and originality as a [[Record producer|producer]].<ref name="Uncut09"/> ''Rolling Stone'' magazine later called Page's guitar riff for the latter song "one of the most exhilarating guitar riffs in rock & roll."<ref name="rs500"/> Band member and multi-instrumentalist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] later discussed Page's contributions, stating:

{{quote|Jimmy started coming into his own as a producer around "Whole Lotta Love". The [[backwards echo]] stuff. A lot of the microphone techniques were just inspired. Everybody thinks he goes into the studio with huge walls of amps, but he doesn't. He uses a really small amp and he just mic's it up really well, so it fits into a sonic picture.<ref name="Uncut09"><U+201C>I first met Jimmy on Tolworth Broadway, holding a bag of exotic fish...<U+201D>, ''[[Uncut magazine|Uncut]]'', January 2009, p. 40.</ref>|John Paul Jones}}

The album's material marked a certain honing of singer Robert Plant's vocal approach,<ref name=complete2>Liner notes by [[Cameron Crowe]] for ''[[The Complete Studio Recordings (Led Zeppelin album)|The Complete Studio Recordings]]'', p. 9.</ref> and also signaled his emergence as a serious songwriter.<ref name = Schulps /> Plant's name had previously been absent from the songwriting credits of the band's first album due to the previous contractual commitments that resulted from his earlier association with [[CBS Records]] as a solo artist. His influence on tracks such as "What Is and What Should Never Be" and "Ramble On" were pointers to the musical future of Led Zeppelin.<ref name = Complete/> Plant has commented that it was only during the sessions for ''Led Zeppelin II'' that he started to feel at home as a vocalist in the studio with Led Zeppelin. In a 2008 interview for ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'', he stated "[D]uring ''Led Zep I'' (1969) as far as I was concerned, I thought that I was going to [leave the band] anyway. I didn't feel that comfortable because there were a lot of demands on me vocally - which there were all the way though the Zeppelin thing. And I was quite nervous and didn't really get into enjoying it until ''II''."<ref name=plantuncut>Jones, Allan.

ISBN 0-85797-930-3, p. 40.</ref> The advertising campaign was built around the slogan 'Led Zeppelin II Now Flying'.<ref name = Complete/> Commercially, ''Led Zeppelin II'' was the band's first album to hit #1 in the U.S., temporarily knocking [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Abbey Road (album)|Abbey Road]]'' (1969) from the top spot, where it remained for seven weeks.<ref name = Complete/> By April 1970 it had registered three million American sales, whilst in Britain it enjoyed a 138 week residence on the LP chart, climbing to the top spot in February 1970.<ref name=Complete>Lewis, Dave (1994), ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin'', Omnibus Press, pp. 13<U+2013>19. ISBN 0-7119-3528-9</ref> The album also yielded Led Zeppelin's biggest hit, with the track "[[Whole Lotta Love]]". This song reached #4 on the Billboard Top 100 in January 1970, after [[Atlantic Records]] went against the group's wishes by releasing a shorter version on 45. The single's B-side, "[[Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)]]", also hit the Billboard chart, peaking at #65 in April 1970. The album helped establish Led Zeppelin as an international concert attraction, as for the next year, the group continued to tour relentlessly, initially performing in clubs and [[ballroom]]s, then in larger [[auditorium]]s and eventually [[stadium]]s as their popularity grew.<ref>[http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:wifexqe5ldde~T1 allmusic: Led Zeppelin - Bio].

In 1970 the album was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in the category of [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package|best album package]].<ref name = Complete/> On 10 November 1969, the album was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] in sales by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), and, in 1990, it earned platinum status after selling over one million copies.

==Influence==
''Led Zeppelin II'' has been cited by music writers as a blueprint for 1970s [[hard rock]].<ref name="allmusicguide"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|year=2007|title=All Music Guide Required Listening: Classic Rock<U+200E>|edition=1st|location=San Francisco|publisher=Backbeat Books|page=98|isbn=0-87930-917-2}}</ref> Blues-derived songs like "Whole Lotta Love", "Heartbreaker", "The Lemon Song" and "Bring It On Home" have been cited as standards of the genre, where the [[guitar]]-based [[riff]] (rather than [[vocal]] [[Refrain|chorus]] or [[Verse-chorus form|verses]]) defines the song and provides the key hook.<ref name = Complete/> Such arrangements and emphasis were at the time atypical in popular music.<ref name="allmusicguide"/> Page's guitar solo in "[[Heartbreaker (Led Zeppelin song)|Heartbreaker]]" featuring [[tapping|rapid-fire runs]] of notes tapped only by the left hand, was a major inspiration to the later work of metal soloists and "[[shred_guitar|shredders]]" such as [[Eddie Van Halen]] and [[Steve Vai]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Pete|year=1997|title=Legends of Rock Guitar: The Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists|edition=1st|location=San Francisco|publisher=Hal Leonard|page=165|isbn=0-7935-4042-9}}</ref> As such, the album is generally considered to be very influential on the development of rock music, being an early forerunner of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and inspiring a host of other rock bands including [[Van Halen]], [[Guns N' Roses]] and [[Aerosmith]].<ref name="allmusicguide"/><ref name="hoard">Hoard (2004), p. 479.</ref>
