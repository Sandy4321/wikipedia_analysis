==Reactions==
The state visit was closely followed by journalists and political commentators. [[The Boston Globe]] criticised Obama's decision to postpone a meeting with the Dalai Lama until after the visit to China. In an editorial, the newspaper suggested that the United States should be able to maintain good relations both with Beijing and the Dalai Lama, and that the president "should be using his persuasive powers to convince China's leaders that their interest would be best served if they granted cultural autonomy and religious freedom to Tibetans."<ref name="Boston Globe">{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2009/10/18/obama_pleasing_china_at_dalai_lamas_expense/|title=Obama: Pleasing China, at Dalai Lama<U+2019>s expense|date=18 October 2009|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=06 December 2009}}</ref> [[Fareed Zakaria]], editor of [[Newsweek|Newsweek International]], wrote that the Obama administration was "taking a strategic view that developing strong relationships with [China] will yield long-term benefits." At the same time he expressed a concern that the administration was failing in nurturing similar ties with [[India]]. He described India as "a natural ally of the United States", particularly in the context of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|war in Afghanistan]].<ref name="Zakaria">{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/223794|title=The Prize is India:   A relationship Obama should nurture|last=Zakaria|first=Fareed|date=21 November 2009|work=[[Newsweek]]|accessdate=06 December 2009}}</ref>

For the Chinese, the official visit from the United States' first black president presented an opportunity to confront the issue of racial prejudice in their own country. The number of Africans living in China is growing rapidly, creating a more racially diverse society, but the immigrants are often faced with police brutality and racism.<ref name="Richburg">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/14/AR2009111401147.html|title=Racial rethinking as Obama visits|last=Richburg|first=Keith B.|coauthors=Wang Juan, Zhang Jie|date=15 November 2009|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=06 December 2009}}</ref>

Direct telecast of Obama's arrival in Shanghai showing the President walking down from [[Air Force One]] had sparked many curious comments from Chinese netizens, one of the comment had even became the 2009 internet catch phrase:''A black man, wearing a black shirt, in a dark night, holding a black umbrella, walks into a black country.''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.peacehall.com/forum/200912/zx/2215.shtml|title=<U+4E00><U+4E2A><U+9ED1><U+4EBA><U+FF0C><U+7A7F><U+4E00><U+4EF6><U+9ED1><U+8863><U+FF0C><U+5728><U+4E00><U+4E2A><U+9ED1><U+591C><U+91CC><U+FF0C><U+6491><U+4E00><U+628A><U+9ED1><U+4F1E><U+FF0C><U+8D70><U+8FDB><U+4E86><U+4E00><U+4E2A><U+9ED1><U+8272><U+7684><U+56FD><U+5BB6><U+201D>|date=12/01/2009 |publisher=www.peacehall.com|accessdate=06 December 2009}}</ref>
