'''HMS ''Black Prince''''' was the third ship of that name to serve with the [[Royal Navy]]. She was the world's second ocean-going, iron-hulled, armoured [[warship]], following her [[sister ship]], {{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}}. For a brief period the two {{sclass|Warrior|ironclad}}s were the most powerful warships in the world, being virtually impregnable to the naval guns of the time. Rapid advances in naval technology left ''Black Prince'' and her sister obsolete within a short time, however, and she spent more time in reserve and training roles than in first-line service.

''Black Prince'' spent her active career with the [[Channel Fleet]] and was [[hulk (ship)|hulk]]ed in 1896, becoming a harbour training ship in [[Queenstown, Ireland]]. She was renamed ''Emerald'' in 1903 and then ''Impregnable III'' in 1910 when she was assigned to the training establishment in [[Plymouth]]. The ship was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1923.

==Design and description==
HMS ''Black Prince'' was {{convert|380|ft|2|in|m|1}} [[Length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and {{convert|420|ft|m|1}} long [[length overall|overall]]. She had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|58|ft|4|in|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|26|ft|10|in|m|1}}.<ref name=b1>Ballard, p. 241</ref> The ship displaced {{convert|9137|LT|t|lk=on}}. The hull was subdivided by watertight transverse [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s into 92 compartments and had a [[double bottom]] underneath the [[engine room|engine]] and [[boiler room (ship)|boiler room]]s.<ref name=p18>Parkes, p. 18</ref>

===Propulsion===
The ''Warrior''-class ships had one 2-cylinder [[Trunk engine|trunk steam engine]] made by [[John Penn (engineer)|John Penn and Sons]] driving a single {{convert|24|ft|6|in|m|1|adj=on}} propeller.<ref>Ballard, p. 246</ref> Ten rectangular [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s<ref>Gardiner, p. 7</ref> provided steam to the engine at a working pressure of {{convert|20|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The engine produced a total of {{convert|5772|ihp|lk=on}} during ''Black Prince''{{'}}s [[sea trial]]s in September 1862 and the ship had a maximum speed of {{convert|13.6|kn|lk=on}} under steam alone.<ref>Ballard, pp. 246<U+2013>47</ref> The ship carried {{convert|800|LT|t}} of coal, enough to steam {{convert|2100|nmi|lk=on}} at {{convert|11|knots}}.<ref name=p01>Parkes, pp. 20<U+2013>21</ref>

The ironclads were [[ship rig]]ged and had a sail area of {{convert|48400|sqft|sqm|0}}. ''Black Prince'' could only do {{convert|11|kn}} under sail, {{convert|2|kn}} slower than her [[sister ship|sister]] {{HMS|Warrior|1860|2}}.<ref name=p01/>

===Armament===
The armament of the ''Warrior''-class ships was intended to be 40 [[British ordnance terms#SBML|smoothbore, muzzle-loading]] [[68-pounder gun]]s, 19 on each side on the main deck and one each fore and aft as [[chase gun]]s on the upper deck. This was modified during construction to ten rifled [[RBL 7 inch Armstrong gun|110-pounder]] [[breechloader|breech-loading guns]], twenty-six 68-pounders, and four rifled breech-loading [[RBL 40 pounder Armstrong gun|40-pounder]] guns as [[Salute#Heavy arms: gun salutes|saluting guns]].<ref>Lambert, p. 85</ref>

The {{convert|7.9|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} [[roundshot|solid shot]] of the 68-pounder gun weighed approximately {{convert|68|lb|kg|1}} while the gun itself weighed {{convert|10640|lb|kg|1}}. The gun had a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|1579|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and had a range of {{convert|3200|yd}} at an elevation of 12<U+00B0>. The {{convert|7|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} shell of the 110-pounder Armstrong breech-loader weighed {{convert|107|-|110|lb|1}}. It had a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1150|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and, at an elevation of 11.25<U+00B0>, a maximum range of {{convert|4000|yd}}. The shell of the 40-pounder breech-loading gun was {{convert|4.75|in|0}} in diameter and weighed {{convert|40|lbs|1}}. The gun had a maximum range of {{convert|3800|yd}}<ref>Lambert, pp. 85<U+2013>7, 89</ref> at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1150|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.<ref>Textbook of Gunnery</ref> In 1863<U+2013>64 the 40-pounder guns were replaced by a heavier version with the same ballistics. All of the guns could fire both [[Round shot|solid shot]] and [[Shell (projectile)|explosive shells]].<ref>Lambert, pp. 86<U+2013>87, 89</ref>

''Black Prince'' was rearmed during her 1867<U+2013>68 refit with twenty-four 7-inch and four {{convert|8|in|0|adj=on}} [[Muzzle-loading rifle|rifled muzzle-loading guns]]. The ship also received four [[RBL 20 pounder Armstrong gun|20-pounder]] breech-loading guns for use as saluting guns.<ref name=p19>Parkes, p. 19</ref> The shell of the 15-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[RML 8 inch 9 ton gun|8-inch gun]] weighed {{convert|175|lb|kg|1}} while the gun itself weighed {{convert|9|LT|t}}. It had a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|1410|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal {{convert|9.6|in|mm|0}} of [[wrought iron]] armour at the [[muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]]. The 16-calibre [[RML 7 inch 6.5 ton gun|7-inch gun]] weighed {{convert|6.5|LT|t}} and fired a {{convert|112|lb|kg|1|adj=on}} shell. It was credited with the nominal ability to penetrate {{convert|7.7|in|mm|adj=on|0}} armour.<ref>Gardiner, p. 6</ref>

===Armour===
The sides of ''Black Prince'' were protected by an armour [[Belt armor|belt]] of [[wrought iron]], {{convert|4.5|in|mm|0}} thick, that covered the middle {{convert|213|ft|1}} of the ship. The ends of the ship were left entirely unprotected which meant that the steering gear was very vulnerable. The armour extended {{convert|16|ft|1}} above the [[waterline]] and {{convert|6|ft|1}} below it. 4.5-inch transverse bulkheads protected the guns on the main deck. The armour was backed by {{convert|16|in}} of [[teak]].<ref name=p19/>

==Service==
[[File:HMS Black Prince(1861) Masts Manned.jpg|thumb|left|''Black Prince'' with masts manned by sailors]]
''Black Prince'' was ordered on 6 October 1859<ref name=b0>Ballard, p. 240</ref> from [[Robert Napier (engineer)|Robert Napier & Sons]] in [[Govan]], [[Glasgow]] for the price of <U+00A3>377,954.<ref>Parkes, p. 16</ref><ref group=Note>Adjusted for inflation to 20{{CURRENTYEARYY}} pounds, <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|377954|1859}}}}.</ref> The ship was laid down on 12 October 1859 and launched 27 February 1861. Her completion was delayed by a [[drydock]] accident at [[Greenock]] while [[fitting out]], which damaged her masts. She steamed to [[Spithead]] in November 1861 with only [[jury-rig]]ged fore and mizzenmasts.<ref>Parkes, pp. 16, 24</ref> The ship was commissioned in June 1862, but was not completed until 12 September 1862.<ref name=b0/> ''Black Prince'' was assigned to the [[Channel Fleet]] until 1866, then spent a year as [[flagship]] on the Irish coast. Overhauled and rearmed in 1867<U+2013>68, she became [[guardship]] on the [[River Clyde]]. The routine of that duty was interrupted in 1869 when she and ''Warrior'' towed a large [[floating drydock]] from [[Madeira]] to [[Bermuda]].<ref>Ballard, pp. 56, 58</ref>

''Black Prince'' was again refitted in 1874<U+2013>75, gaining a [[poop deck]], and rejoined the Channel Fleet as [[flagship]] of [[Rear Admiral]] Sir [[Sir John Dalrymple-Hay, 3rd Baronet|John Dalrymple-Hay]], second-in-command of the fleet. In 1878 [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[H.R.H.]] [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Duke of Edinburgh]] took command and the ship crossed the Atlantic to participate in the installation of a new [[Governor General of Canada]]. Upon her return ''Black Prince'' was placed in reserve at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]], and, reclassified as an [[armoured cruiser]], she was reactivated periodically to take part in annual fleet exercises. ''Black Prince'' was hulked in 1896 as a harbour [[training ship]], stationed at Queenstown, and was renamed ''Emerald'' in 1903. In 1910 the ship was moved to Plymouth and renamed ''Impregnable III'' when she was assigned to the training school [[HMS Impregnable (training establishment 1862)|HMS ''Impregnable'']] before she was sold for scrap on 21 February 1923.<ref>Ballard, pp. 58<U+2013>59</ref>
