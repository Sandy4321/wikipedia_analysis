'''Alfred Aloysius "Allie" Clark''' (June 16, 1923 <U+2013> April 2, 2012) was an [[United States|American]] [[right fielder]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who played for seven seasons in the [[American League]] with the [[New York Yankees]], [[Cleveland Indians]], [[Philadelphia Athletics]] and [[Chicago White Sox]]. In 358 career games, Clark recorded a [[batting average]] of .262 and accumulated 32 [[home run]]s and 149 [[runs batted in]] (RBIs).

Clark was born in [[South Amboy, New Jersey]], where he attended St. Mary's High School, and joined the New York Yankees organization after graduating. He spent the next six seasons playing minor league baseball and serving in the U.S. Army during [[World War II]]. He made his major league debut in 1947, and after one year with the Yankees, he spent four seasons with the Cleveland Indians. He was a member of the World Champion Yankees and Indians after the two teams won the [[1947 World Series]] and [[1948 World Series]], respectively. He then played with the Philadelphia Athletics and Chicago White Sox through 1953, and played minor league baseball until 1958. After retiring, he returned to South Amboy and resided there until his death in 2012.

After graduating from high school, Clark was signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent.

The following year, Clark was promoted to the [[Newark Bears (1926<U+2013>1949)|Newark Bears]] of the [[International League]], having played one game for them the previous year. After playing in 24 games for the Bears, he was called to serve the [[United States Army]] in World War II. Clark served with the combat medical corps in England and France, and saw some active combat in Germany.<ref name=daniel/> After being discharged at the conclusion of the war, Clark returned to baseball in 1946. He was unable to stay in baseball shape due to combat duties, and as a result of having slowed down, the Yankees organization converted him to an outfielder and [[third baseman]].<ref name=daniel/> In 97 games for Newark, Clark hit .344 with 14 home runs and 70 runs batted in.<ref name=brm/>

==Major leagues==
Clark played well enough in 1946 to earn a tryout for the [[1947 New York Yankees season|1947 New York Yankees]], and competed with [[Frank Colman]] for the final outfield position. He lost the battle and began the season in Newark.<ref name=daniel/> Over the course of the 1947 season in Newark, he had a batting average of .334 with 23 home runs and 86 RBIs.<ref name=brm/> His efforts got him noticed by the Yankees, and he made his major league debut on August 5.
