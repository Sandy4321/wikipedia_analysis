'''Stacy Ann-Marie Keibler''' (born [[October 14]], [[1979]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[actor|actress]], former professional wrestler and [[manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] for [[World Championship Wrestling]] and [[World Wrestling Entertainment]].

==Early life==  
Born the only child of Gary and Patricia Keibler and raised in [[Rosedale, Maryland]], a community within [[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore County]], Keibler started dancing at the age of three and studied [[ballet]], [[jazz dance|jazz]] and [[tap dance|tap]] at a local studio, Jean Kettell Studio of Dance, in [[Dundalk, Maryland|Dundalk]]. Keibler attended Catholic High and [[Towson University]], earning near-perfect grades in [[Mass communication|Mass Communication]]{{fact}} at the latter. She later became a [[cheerleader]] for the [[Baltimore Ravens]] [[American football|football]] team, being the youngest of the group.

==Career==
===World Championship Wrestling===
In 1999, Keibler entered a contest held by [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] to find a new member of  [[Nitro Girls]] dance troupe, which she won. Initially a Nitro Girl, Keibler would perform dance routines every week on WCW's flagship show Monday Nitro under the name '''Skye'''. However, this didn't last long as she soon accepted a larger role and became a [[manager (professional wrestling)|valet]] using the provocative [[stage name]] '''Miss Hancock''' (originally Miss Handcock), briefly serving as an associate for the [[tag team]] of [[Leonard Carlson|Lenny Lane]] and [[Brad Cain|Lodi]] dubbed "Standards and Practices". Despite wearing [[Suit (clothes)|business suits]], her character would often climb on top of the announcers table and start dancing sensually, much to the announcers' and fans' delight. It was also during this period that she began using what would become her trademark ring entrance. [[Image:Stacy_Keibler_RingEntrance.jpg|frame|left|Keibler's trademark Ring Entrance]] At 5'11", Keibler was one of few women in professional wrestling tall enough to step over the middle of three ropes that surround the ring. She would do so while pausing momentarily to give the audience a peek of her famed "assets," as her ring attire usually included either hotpants or a miniskirt with a skimpy [[thong]] ([[G-string]]) underneath. This tease, among others, would remain a staple of Keibler's risque gimmick throughout the rest of her professional wrestling career. 
 
After Standards and Practices "fired" her, Keibler went on to become the manager for Los Fabulosos, a Latin American tag team consisting of [[C<U+00E9>sar Gonz<U+00E1>lez|Silver King]] and [[El Dandy]], leading them to their first major victories within WCW.

For a brief period, she dated [[David Flair]] (both on screen and off), who was already involved in a faux relationship with [[Shannon Spruill|Daffney]]. This led to Keibler's in-ring debut at the Bash at the Beach in a Wedding Gown Match, which she lost after she, as well as David Flair and the referee, were left in the ring in their underwear. Keibler removed her own gown. 

Hancock was next brought into a brief feud with [[Kimberly Page]], but Page quit the company at the beginning of the feud after problems with [[Scott Steiner]] and a refusal to wrestle Keibler on Pay-Per View.

Keibler and Flair began a feud with the Misfits in Action [[stable (professional wrestling)|stable]], which saw her fall to [[Tylene Buck|Major Gunns]] in a mud wrestling match at [[New Blood Rising]]. 

In another notable angle, Keibler feigned pregnancy and later broke up with Flair. Originally, the angle called for her to reveal the baby's father as [[Vince Russo]]. She began to use her real name and became the valet for [[Shawn Stasiak]].

===World Wrestling Entertainment===
====2001-2003====
When WCW was purchased by the WWF in 2001, her contract was one of 24 that were retained by the WWF. She portrayed a [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] character in [[The Alliance]]. She made her WWF TV debut on the [[June 14]], [[2001]] episode of [[Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown!]] when [[Shane McMahon]] brought her to the ring to distract [[Terry Gerin|Rhyno]], causing him to lose a match. Keibler originally teamed up with real-life friend [[Torrie Wilson]] and the pair feuded with WWF [[diva (professional wrestling)|divas]] [[Trish Stratus]] and [[Amy Dumas|Lita]]. During this feud, the four Divas competed in the first-ever tag team bra and panties match at the [[WWF InVasion]] pay-per-view. 

Towards the end of the [[The Invasion (pro wrestling)|WCW/ECW Invasion]], Keibler managed [[Dudley Boyz|The Dudley Boyz]], during which time she was [[nickname]]d the "[[Duke|Duchess]] of Dudleyville" by announcer [[Paul Heyman]]. She proved to be a fan favorite in this role, which lead to newfound popularity for the tag team. An early highlight of her career, Keibler made her WrestleMania debut at WrestleMania XVIII alongside the Dudleyz. Keibler's main angle at the time was getting [[pantsed]] by her opponent, revealing her lace panties. Jacqueline, Spike Dudley and Torrie Wilson were among those to strip Keibler. During this time, she also feuded with former ally Torrie Wilson after Wilson left The Alliance. Keibler helped The Dudley Boyz put Torrie through a table. However, Torrie got her revenge after first giving Keibler a [[wedgie]] and pantsing her on an episode of ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|Smackdown]]''. She then defeated Keibler in the the first-ever [[lingerie]] match at [[WWE No Mercy]]. Keibler's role with the Dudley Boyz came to an abrupt end when she was powerbombed through a table after accidentally costing the team a match. Keibler was still a heel after the Alliance broke up. She competed for the Women's Championship several times, usually coming up short in gimmick matches to then-champion Trish Stratus. [[Image:StacyvsTrish.jpg|thumb|right|Keibler loses a bra and panties paddle match to Trish.]]

Keibler was originally [[WWE Draft|drafted]] to the ''SmackDown!'' brand in 2002, where she participated in a comedy segment involving WWE Chairman [[Vince McMahon]] hiring a personal assistant. McMahon was ready to hire another attractive female until Keibler interrupted and demonstrated why she should get the job by giving him a [[table dance]] in the ring. Keibler became Vince's personal assistant as well as his on-screen mistress, frequently shown flirting and even 'making out' with him in backstage segments, until Stephanie McMahon became [[List of authority figures in professional wrestling|general manager]] of the ''SmackDown!'' brand. [[Dawn Marie Psaltis|Dawn Marie]] made her debut on ''SmackDown!'' as Vince's legal assistant, who competed with Keibler for McMahon's affections. 

A key [[angle (professional wrestling)|storyline]] for Keibler's on-screen character occured when she left ''SmackDown!'' for ''[[WWE Raw|RAW]]''. Keibler made her official ''RAW'' debut on [[August 12]], [[2002]]. After her acquisition was announced by then-General Manager Eric Bischoff, she greeted the cheering crowd and then removed her skirt as she performed one of her signature table dances on the ''RAW'' announcer's table. During her ensuing time on ''RAW'', Keibler managed [[Scott Steiner]] and [[Andrew Martin|Test]], the latter of which was her real-life boyfriend at the time. She was also involved in the eventual feud between these two. As Test's on-screen marketing agent, she came up with the idea that Test should call his fans "Testicles," cut his hair and reshape his image. However, Test became jealous of Keibler wanting to also be Steiner's manager. During a match on ''RAW'', Test turned heel and began verbally abusing Keibler. Steiner managed to defeat Test for Keibler's services, and Keibler seemed happy as Steiner's new manager, as the two characters even alluded to having more than a professional relationship. Test, however, was not happy at all, and petitioned for an intergender tag team match, pitting himself and former rival [[Chris Jericho]] against Scott and Keibler, to win back the services of Keibler. Test faked a leg injury to pick up the win. 

A match was set for [[WWE Unforgiven]], the stipulation being if Test won, he would not only retain Keibler's services, but acquire those of Scott Steiner as well. During the match, Keibler attempted to distract Test by lifting her skirt and shaking her bare butt for the crowd. This was unsuccessful. Keibler then attempted to whack Test with a chair, but he ducked and she accidentally hit Steiner instead. As a result, Test won the match and the services of both Keibler and Steiner. Steiner would then turn heel by attacking Keibler when she botched another interference on the next ''RAW''. For a time, Test and Steiner would work as a tag team, sharing the services of Keibler. Finally, General Manager [[Mick Foley]] put a stop to the abusive Test and Steiner and freed Keibler from her obligatory contracts with the pair by temporarily firing them.

====2004====
[[Image:Dvd-vivalasdivasofthewwe.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Keibler on the cover of the ''Viva Las Divas'' DVD.]]
Keibler was chosen to record a track on the album ''[[WWE Originals]]''. She and WWE music producer [[Jim Johnston (composer)|Jim Johnston]] recorded the track "Why Can't We Just Dance?" for the album. Other tracks were performed by Superstars such as [[Chris Jericho]], [[Lilian Garcia]] and [[John Cena]], each of which had their own music career. Her track was used on an episode of ''[[WWE Raw|RAW]]'' for herself, during the [[WWE Diva Search|2004 RAW Diva Search]] and even on the ''Viva Las Diva of the WWE'' DVD.    

As one of the more popular RAW face Divas, Keibler took over the 2004 RAW Diva Search for a few weeks. That was followed by a dance competition with [[Noreen Greenwald|Molly]]. This led to a push with her participating in several tag matches against the heel girls, then WWE Diva, [[Gail Kim]], then heel and then WWE Diva, [[Trish Stratus]] and then WWE Diva, [[Noreen Greenwald|Molly Holly]]. Her partners were WWE star, [[Nidia Guenard|Nidia]] and then babyface, [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]]. Keibler showed off much improved wrestling skills, managing to get upset victories over Molly, Gail and Trish. She even got herself a Women's Championship title match on [[October 11]], [[2004]]. However, Trish defeated her to retain the title.   

Keibler was voted as the 2004 [[Diva (professional wrestling)#WWE Babe of the Year|WWE Babe of the Year]], being the first WWE Diva to defeat [[Trish Stratus]] in the Babe of the Year competition (Stratus was 2001-2003 Babe of the Year). As a result of this, Keibler appeared on ''RAW'' following her victory and told everyone that she would bend over backwards to make the fans happy. Keibler's Babe of the Year photoshoots would be posted on WWE's official website on a monthly basis throughout 2005.

====2005====
[[Image:Superstacy.jpg|thumb|right|145px|Keibler had a brief run as Super Stacy, complete with her own superhero costume.]]
Keibler soon began an angle with popular superstar [[Randy Orton]]. After kissing him on the cheek during a backstage segment on ''RAW'', there looked to possibly be a romance there. Randy even saved her from receiving a Pedigree from the villainous [[Triple H]]. She supported him from backstage and was never considered his manager. The storyline never really made any advances, and as Randy challenged [[Mark Calaway|the Undertaker]] to a match at ''[[WrestleMania 21]]'', Randy ended the relationship by giving her an RKO, justifying this evil act by claiming he was demonstrating just how ruthless he could be in order to defeat the Undertaker. In the end, Keibler's involvement with Orton was a device for his inevitable heel turn. Orton was the third on-screen boyfriend to betray Keibler. 

Keibler would go on to join forces with [[Hurricane and Rosey]]. She became 1/3 of their trio as '''Super Stacy''', complete with her own superhero costume. During this time, Keibler was credited as having one of her best matches to date with [[Diva (professional wrestling)|WWE Diva]], [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]], on an international edition of [[WWE Heat]].

After a long tenure on Monday nights, Keibler and fellow ''RAW'' Diva [[Christy Hemme]] were moved to [[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|''SmackDown!'']] as part of a trade, bringing [[Torrie Wilson]] and [[Candice Michelle]] to ''RAW''. Upon their debut, the two former ''RAW'' Divas participated in a bra and panties pillow fight that was deemed too hot for television (the match could be viewed on WWE's official website.) After a short absence, Keibler started a short feud with [[Jillian Hall]], which lead to the two having a match on [[WWE Velocity|''Velocity'']], during which Hall captured the victory through cheating. The match represented Keibler's final match and final appearance on WWE television.

====2006====
Keibler appeared on the hit show ''[[Dancing with the Stars (US TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' (see [[#Outside of wrestling|Outside of wrestling]]), placing third.  Recaps were aired weekly on ''[[WWE Raw|RAW]]'', which was believed to be because of a conflict with ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown!]]'' and [[UPN]] not wanting to promote a rival network. After a few weeks, her profile was moved from ''SmackDown!'' back to ''RAW''.

In April 2006, Vegas Magazine reported that Keibler was done with WWE and moving on to other endeavors. Keibler posted a message on her official website saying that her WWE contract  expired on [[July 21]], [[2006]], and she went on to sign a contract with Touchstone Television, which is owned by Disney.

==Outside of wrestling==    
[[Image:Tony and Stacy Tango.jpg|right|thumb|140px|Keibler dancing the [[Tango (dance)|tango]] with partner [[Tony Dovolani]].]]   
For several months, Keibler wrote a monthly fitness column for ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff Magazine]]'' titled ''Getting Fit''. Although her legs are famed for their length and beauty, she has great strength as well. In one issue, she speaks of how she recently attempted a 450 lb leg press. Although unable to push it, she did manage a 405lb leg press. In addition to posing for a total of five full pictorials, Keibler has graced the cover of ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff Magazine]]'' twice, in [http://www.stuffmagazine.com/cover_girls/girl.aspx?id=470&src=wiki June 2005] and [http://www.stuffmagazine.com/cover_girls/girl.aspx?id=541&src=wiki March 2006]. ''Maxim'' named her #5 in their 2006 [http://www.maximonline.com/slideshows/index.aspx?slideId=1910&imgCollectId=94&src=wiki Hot 100] issue.

Keibler has refused at least three offers to pose for [[Playboy]], believing that it would be better if she "left something for the imagination."

She competed in the second season of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (US TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''. Her dance partner was [[ballroom dance]]r [[Tony Dovolani]]. Keibler managed to score a perfect 10 in the earliest round of the competition ever. Keibler received a perfect score of 30 from the three judges for her [[Samba (dance)|samba]] dance routine in week five. This prompted the judges to nickname her a "weapon of mass seduction." The following week, two perfect scores were awarded, one going to Keibler, the other to fellow contestant [[Drew Lachey]]. Overall, Keibler and Tony received four perfect scores. Keibler came in third to Jerry Rice, who placed second in the final round of the competition, and Lachey, the winner of the season. 

Keibler has also appeared on [[MTV]]'s [[Punk'd]] twice. Once, as an accomplice to [[Triple H]]'s punk, along with [[Stephanie McMahon]], in season five. Keibler was then seen again in season seven, this time being Punk'd herself by her boyfriend, [[Geoff Stults]].

Keibler (along with Stults) is part-owner of the [[Hollywood Fame]], a [[2006]] expansion franchise of the [[American Basketball Association (21st century)|American Basketball Association]].

In February 2007, Keibler began her recurring role on ABC's Monday night dramedy, [[What About Brian]]. She plays the role of Brian's new neighbor. This marks Keibler's first significant acting role, compared to her previous minor roles in both "Bubble Boy" and "Pecker".

Keibler also guest starred on [[The George Lopez Show]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] when the show returned in January. According to an interview on E! Television, she hopes to have her own sitcom soon and is also working on [[The Comebacks]], a comedy film produced by [[Punk'd]] producer Adam Goldberg.

==Personal life== 
During her days with WCW, Keibler was romantically linked with [[David Flair]], the son of legendary wrestler [[Ric Flair]]. After joining WWE, Keibler was in a relationship with Test for several years. The couple were reported to have separated shortly before Martin was fired by WWE while he recovered from neck surgery, but maintained a friendship. 

In [[June 2005]], Keibler was rumored to be in a relationship with actor [[Geoff Stults]], best known for his appearances on ''[[7th Heaven]]''. The couple were photographed at many places together and seen as an [[wiktionary:item|item]].  The pair also appeared together on [[MTV]]'s [[Punk'd]], with Keibler as the recipient of the prank. The [[September 2005]] edition of the tabloid, ''[[Star Magazine]]'', claimed that Keibler was involved in a [[love triangle]] with Geoff Stults and actress [[Jennifer Aniston]].  It was later announced that Aniston was in a relationship with the man that supposedly got her and Stults together, [[Vince Vaughn]]. Keibler denied rumors of a relationship with Stults in two interviews and gave a "no comment" to [[Todd Grisham]] when asked about it on [[WWE Byte This!|Byte This!]].

On [[May 16]], [[2006]], Keibler suffered a [[seizure]] at the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Upfront Presentation in [[New York City]], and was hospitalized. The seizure was said to be minor and Keibler was released from the hospital shortly after. Four days later, Keibler appeared on the [[ESPN]] pre-race telecast of the [[Preakness Stakes]], in an interview with [[Kenny Mayne]].
