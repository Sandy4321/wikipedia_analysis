[[Image:Vyborg s vody.jpg|right|thumb|275px|[[Vyborg Castle]] was founded by the Swedes in 1293.]]
The Russian [[Republic of Novgorod]] and medieval [[Sweden]] waged a number of wars for control of the [[Gulf of Finland]], an area vital for the lucrative [[Hanseatic]] trade, and part of the former [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]]. The Swedish attacks against [[Russian Orthodoxy|Orthodox Russians]] had religious overtones, but before the 14th century there is no knowledge of official [[Crusade]] [[papal bull|bull]]s given by the [[Pope]]. 

==Background==

The conflict was rooted in the [[Viking Age]] when the [[Varangians]] had a trade outpost in [[Ladoga]] and controlled the course of the [[Neva River]]. The Slavicization and Christianization of Northern Russia accounted for the deterioration of relations between the Vikings and Novgorod at the turn of the 11th century. [[Eir<U+00ED>kr H<U+00E1>konarson]] raided Ladoga in 997, followed by his brother [[Sveinn H<U+00E1>konarson]] in 1015. After [[Yaroslav I]]'s marriage to [[Ingegerd of Sweden]] in 1019 the conflict was settled by making Ladoga a [[jarl]]dom in the orbit of [[Kievan Rus]]. It was ruled by [[Ragnvald Ulfsson]], father of King [[Stenkil]]. Stenkil's granddaughter Christina married [[Mstislav I of Kiev|Mstislav of Novgorod]], upon whose death in 1132 [[Republic of Novgorod|Novgorod]] seceded from [[Kievan Rus]].

==Fighting resumes==

The 12th century is badly documented in Sweden, and Russian documents are fragmented. From the surviving sources it however seems evident, that the newly found republic and Sweden drifted into hostilities that could not be permanently settled ever again.

According to [[First Novgorod Chronicle]], the Swedish troops attacked the Novgorod merchants somewhere in the [[Baltic Sea]] region and killed 150 Novgorodians in 1142. It is the first known case of hostilities between Sweden and Novgorod. In 1164, a strong Swedish fleet approached Ladoga but was soundly defeated with most of its ships captured by Novgorod.<ref>The Novgorod "Karamzin's" Annals, the Full Collection of Russian Annals, vol. 42, St.-Petersburg 2002. See also online descriptions for [http://195.148.246.230/DF/detail.php?id=15 1142] and [http://195.148.246.230/DF/detail.php?id=23 1164] attacks, as maintained by University of Turku; in Swedish. The number of ships in the Swedish fleet participating in the attacks was 60 and 55, respectively. The theoretical maximum capacity of the ''[[ledung]]'' has been calculated to around 280 ships. Of this only a quarter was usually mobilized at any one time, which brings the expected figures close to what chronicles claimed. Number of men in such a fleet would have been around 2500. See Jokipii, Mauno: ''The ledung institution - the instrument of Scandinavian crusades.'' Published in Suomen museo 2002 (ISBN 951-9057-47-1), page 85.</ref>

It is also claimed that Novgorodians and their [[Karelia]]n allies launched [[pirate]] raids against mainland [[Sweden]] during the [[12th century]].<ref>[http://www.vokrugsveta.ru/telegraph/history/102 Article about Sigtuna raid by ''Vokrug Sveta'']. In Russian.</ref> During one of such raids, as a legend has it, they brought to Novgorod the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod|doors]] of the [[Sigtuna]] cathedral as a prize. However, there is no certainty on the background of the destroyers of Sigtuna. Swedish sources call them just "heathens" and Novgorodian sources say no word about the event, which would be least expected had they conducted it.<ref>The only source that claims the attackers to have been Karelians is the [[Eric's Chronicle]] written in early 14th century as anti-Novgorod propaganda. Most historians consider the attackers to have come from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coasts.</ref> {{Russo<U+2013>Swedish War Series}} Swedish sources also claim that [[Jon jarl]] spent 9 years fighting against Novgorodians and Ingrians at the end of the 12th century.<ref>''Suomen museo 2002''. See page 65.</ref> These expeditions are not documented in Russian sources.

==Battle of the Neva==

{{main|Battle of the Neva}}

After a long pause in open hostilities, Swedes undertook an attack against Novgorod in [[1240]].<ref>Only source of information on the attack is the First Primary Chronicle written 100 years after the attack. Famously Swedish sources leave it unnoticed. The attack has been speculated to have been led by [[Birger jarl|Birger Magnusson]], who was elevated to the position of [[jarl in Sweden|jarl]] in 1248. The only enemy leader named by the chronicle was "Spiridon" who was allegedly killed in the battle. Attempts to identify Spiridon with Birger have been made (see e.g. Riasanovsky, Nicholas V.: ''A History of Russia''. Oxford 1993). Chronicle also claims that a bishop accompanying the army was killed; however, no Swedish bishop is known to have died in 1240. Furthermore, no other important Swedes are known to have died that year either. See [http://195.148.246.230/DF/detail.php?id=83 related chronicle entry]; in Swedish.</ref> Soon after their fleet entered the mouth of the [[Neva River]], the Swedes were roundly defeated in the famous [[Battle of the Neva]] by a young prince, [[Alexander Nevsky|Alexander of Novgorod]], who would later be given the [[Victory title|epithet]] "Nevsky" to memorialize this victory.

From there on, Sweden seems to have moved its interest to Finland. Its troops did not return to Neva before the end of the 13th century, when it had gained solid control of Finland. Earlier, Swedes had also tried to establish a bridgehead in [[Estonia]], [[Battle of Lihula|in vain]].

==Focus moves to Finland==

Apart from Ladoga, Novgorodian interests clashed with Sweden's in [[Finland]], a country which Russian forces sacked on [[Prehistoric Finnish wars|numerous occasions]] from the 11th century onward. The raid in winter [[1226]]-[[1227]] led to heavy losses on the Finnish side. A Finnish retaliatory raid against Ladoga in [[1228]] ended in disaster, contributing to the Finns' subjugation by the Catholic Swedes during the [[Second Swedish Crusade]] in [[1249]]. Seven years later, the Novgorodians devastated Swedish Finland again. 

In [[1293]] the Swedes won a part of western Karelia and built the fortress of [[Vyborg]] there. This expedition has traditionally been dubbed as the [[Third Swedish Crusade]]. Seven years later, they founded the fortress of [[Landskrona (Neva)|Landskrona]] in the mouth of [[Neva]], on the river [[Okhta]], and ruined the Novgorod settlements on the Neva. Later that year the Novgorod troops retaliated by destroying Landskrona.

In the early [[14th century]], military tensions escalated and the two powers were continually at war.  In [[1311]], the Novgorodians devastated central [[Finland]], where the Swedes had recently built [[Hakoinen Castle|a new castle]]. In response, a Swedish fleet embarked towards Ladoga and set this trade emporium on fire. Three years later, the [[Karelian]]s' discontent with Novgorod's rule broke out into the open, as they killed Russian governors and sought for help in Sweden. After several months of hostilities, Karelia submitted to Novgorod's authority again. [[Image:Oreshek.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Oreshek]], one of fortresses built by the Novgorodians to contain the Swedish expansion.]] 

In [[1318]], Novgorod attacked [[Turku]] in southwestern Finland, burning the city and the [[Turku Cathedral|cathedral]] as well as the episcopal castle in [[Kuusisto Castle|Kuusisto]]. Four years later, they besieged [[Vyborg]] and founded [[Oreshek]], an important fortress dominating the entrance to Lake Ladoga.

==Treaty of N<U+00F6>teborg and its aftermath==

The famous [[Treaty of N<U+00F6>teborg]] on August 12, 1323 was the first and also the last treaty that the conflict counterparts could come in terms with. It was meant to bring "eternal peace", but turned out to provide but a temporary palliative.

Already in [[1328]], Sweden was encouraging settlers to take over the northern coasts of [[Gulf of Bothnia]] which should have been Novgorodian territory.<ref>Vahtola, Jouko. ''Tornionlaakson historia I''. Birkarlit, 'pirkkalaiset'. Malungs boktryckeri AB. Malung, Sweden. 1991.</ref> When [[Karelians]] rebelled against Novgorod in [[1337]], king [[Magnus Eriksson]] sent his troops in their support, managing to briefly occupy [[Korela Fortress]]. Next year Novgorod besieged Vyborg in return, and the armistice was soon agreed upon. Ten years later, the king was ready to renew hostilities. He first demanded Novgorodians to turn to Roman Catholism. After seeing his request ignored, he sent his army to Oreshek, setting it ablaze. Novgorod soon recovered the lost ground. The king attempted yet another fruitless attack in [[1350]]. In the same year, [[Black Death]] broke down in Northern Europe, effectively ending further hostilities.<ref>Kari, Risto: ''Suomalaisten keskiaika'', 2004. ISBN 951-0-28321-5. See page 163.</ref>

==Later developments==

Later skirmishes were more sporadic, as Novgorod was becoming increasingly weak to protect its interest in the north. Sweden's increased attempts to control Gulf of Bothnia provocated Novgorod to start constructing a castle near Oulu River delta in the 1370s. Sweden replied by establishing [[Oulu Castle|their own castle]] near-by, resulting in Novgorod assaulting it 1377, without being able to take it over. [[Pope Gregory XI]] gave a crusade bull against Novgorod in the following year. Russians seem to have retreated from Ostrobothnia soon thereafter.

Hostilities between the two powers were renewed in [[1392]] and [[1411]]. However, as Sweden had become a member state in the quarrelsome [[Union of Kalmar]] in the late 14th century, Swedes were more or less focused on the Scandinavian power struggle for the next 100 years. 

The last conflict ensued in [[1445]], several decades before Novgorod was absorbed into [[Muscovy]]. Novgorod's demise did not grant peace, and the conflict continued between [[Russia]] and Sweden until the early 19th century.
