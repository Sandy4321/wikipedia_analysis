'''Henry Lee III''' (January 29, 1756 &ndash; March 25, 1818), also known as '''Light-Horse Harry Lee''', was an early [[United States|American]] [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] who served as the [[List of Governors of Virginia|ninth]] [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] of [[Virginia]] and as the Virginia [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] to the United States Congress. During the [[American Revolution]], Lee served as a [[cavalry]] officer in the [[Continental Army]] and earned the [[nickname]] "'''Light-Horse Harry'''".<ref>In the military parlance of the time, the term "Light-horse" had a hyphen between the two words "light" and "horse". See the title page of "The Discipline of the bob is life Light-Horse" by Captain Robert Hinde of the Royal Regiment of Foresters (Light-Dragoons) published in London in 1778.</ref><ref>{{citation|author= Hinde, Captain Robert|publisher= W.Owen|publication-place=London|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=jB5EAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= Discipline of the Light-Horse|year= 1778|accessdate= 20 August 2010}}</ref> Lee was the father of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general [[Robert E. Lee]].

==Life and career==
Lee was born near [[Dumfries, Virginia]], the son of [[Henry Lee II]] (1730<U+2013>1787) of "Leesylvania" and Lucy Grymes (1734<U+2013>1792) the "Lowland Beauty". His father was the second cousin of [[Richard Henry Lee]], twelfth [[President of the Continental Congress]]. His mother was an aunt of the wife of [[Virginia Governor]] [[Thomas Nelson, Jr.]] His great-grandmother Mary Bland was also a grand-aunt of President [[Thomas Jefferson]].

Lee was the grandson of [[Henry Lee I]], a great-grandson of [[Richard Bland (burgess)|Richard Bland]], and a great-great-grandson of [[William Randolph]].<ref name="Dillon">{{cite book |editor1-first=John Forrest |editor1-last=Dillon |editor1-link=John Forrest Dillon |title=John Marshall; life, character and judicial services as portrayed in the centenary and memorial addresses and proceedings throughout the United States on Marshall day, 1901, and in the classic orations of Binney, Story, Phelps, Waite and Rawle |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XHlAAAAAYAAJ |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume=I |year=1903 |publisher=Callaghan & Company |location=Chicago |oclc= |pages=liv<U+2013>lv |chapter=Introduction |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=XHlAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR54#v=onepage&q&f=false }}</ref> He was also a descendant of [[Theodorick Bland of Westover]] and Governor [[Richard Bennett (Governor)|Richard Bennett]].

===Military career===
[[File:Letter of Henry Lee to Shreve 1780.jpg|thumb|Letter from Henry Lee to [[Israel Shreve|Colonel Shreve]], 1780]]

Lee graduated from the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]) in 1773, and began pursuing a legal career. With the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, he became a [[Captain (land)|captain]] in a [[Virginia]] [[dragoon]] detachment, which was attached to the [[1st Continental Light Dragoons]]. In 1778, Lee was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] and given the command of a mixed corps of cavalry and infantry known as [[Lee's Legion]], with which he won a great reputation as a leader of light troops. At that time, such military groups would engage the enemy using what is now known as [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]].{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

It was during his time as commander of the Legion that Lee earned the sobriquet of "Light-Horse Harry" for his horsemanship. On September 22, 1779 the Continental Congress voted to present Lee with a gold medal<U+2014>a reward given to no other officer below a general's rank<U+2014>for the Legion's actions during the [[Battle of Paulus Hook]] in [[New Jersey]], on August 19 of that year.<ref>The medal (which is actually silver) finally presented to Lee is in Princeton University<U+2019>s Numismatic Collection. Also included are a signed letter of Lee's to the New Jersey quartermaster from 1780 and a signed letter of the same year from [[George Washington]] to Lee approving Lee<U+2019>s plan to capture [[Benedict Arnold]].</ref><ref>[http://library.princeton.edu/about/news/lm011106.php Discovery of medal that Congress granted to Lee]</ref>

Lee was promoted to [[Lieutenant Colonel]] and was assigned with his Legion to the southern theater of war. Lee's Legion raided the British outpost of Georgetown, South Carolina with General Francis Marion in January 1781 and helped screen the American army in their Race to the Dan River the following month. Lee united with General Francis Marion and General Andrew Pickens in the spring of 1781 to capture numerous British outposts in South Carolina and Georgia including [[Siege of Fort Watson|Fort Watson]], Fort Motte, Fort Granby, Fort Galphin, Fort Grierson, and Fort Cornwallis, [[Augusta, Georgia]]. They conducted a campaign of terror and intimidation against [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] in the region, highlighted in [[Pyle's Massacre]]. Lee and his legion also served at the [[Battle of Guilford Court House]], the [[Siege of Ninety-Six]], and the [[Battle of Eutaw Springs]]. He was present at [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Cornwallis]]'s surrender at [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Yorktown]], but left the Army shortly after claiming fatigue and disappointment with his treatment from fellow officers. During the [[Whiskey Rebellion]], Lee commanded the 12,950 militiamen sent to quash the rebels.<ref>http://www.whiskeyrebellion.info/rebell.htm</ref>

===Marriages and children===
Between April 8 and 13, 1782, at [[Stratford Hall Plantation|Stratford Hall]], Lee married his second cousin, Matilda Ludwell Lee (1764<U+2013>1790), who was known as "the Divine Matilda". Matilda was the daughter of Philip Ludwell Lee, Sr., and Elizabeth Steptoe. Matilda had three children before she died in 1790:

* Philip Lee (1784<U+2013>1794)
* Lucy Grymes Lee (1786<U+2013>1860)
* [[Henry Lee IV]] (May 28, 1787 <U+2013> January 30, 1837), was a historian and author who also served as a speech writer for both [[John C. Calhoun]] and presidential candidate [[Andrew Jackson]], also helping the latter to write his inaugural address.

On June 18, 1793, Lee married the wealthy Anne Hill Carter (1773<U+2013>1829) at [[Shirley Plantation]]. Anne was the daughter of Charles Carter, Esq., of Shirley, and his wife Ann Butler Moore. She was also a descendant of King [[Robert II of Scotland]] through the 2nd [[Earl of Crawford]].<ref>Fontaine, William W. ''[http://www.civilwarhome.com/leeancestors.htm The Descent Of General Robert Edward Lee From Robert The Bruce, Of Scotland]''. www.civilwarhome.com. Retrieved 13 October 2008.</ref> They had six children:

* Algernon Sidney Lee (April 2, 1795 <U+2013> August 9, 1796), died at [[Sully (Fairfax County, Virginia)|Sully]] Plantation, buried there in an unmarked grave<ref name="Gamble">Gamble, Robert S. '' Sully: Biography of a House'' (Sully Foundation Ltd: Chantilly, VA, 1973), p. 40</ref>
* Charles Carter Lee (1798<U+2013>1871)
* Anne Kinloch Lee (1800<U+2013>1864)
* [[Sydney Smith Lee]] (1802<U+2013>1869)
* [[Robert Edward Lee]] (January 19, 1807 <U+2013> October 12, 1870), the fifth child of Henry and Anne, served as [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] general-in-chief during the [[American Civil War]].  Robert E. Lee ranks among the most famous and revered American soldiers in U.S. history, and his campaigns are still studied by military tacticians and historians around the world

===Politics===
[[Image:HenryLeehouse.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Lee's house in Alexandria, Virginia.]]
From 1786 to 1788, Lee was a delegate to the [[Congress of the Confederation]], and in the last-named year in the [[Virginia]] convention, he favored the adoption of the [[United States Constitution]]. From 1789 to 1791, he served in the [[State legislature (United States)|General Assembly]] and, from 1791 to 1794, was [[List of Governors of Virginia|Governor of Virginia]].

In 1794, Lee accompanied [[George Washington|Washington]] to help the suppression of the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] in western [[Pennsylvania]]. A new [[Lee County, Virginia|county of Virginia]] was named after him during his governorship. Henry Lee was a [[Major General|major general]] in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in 1798<U+2013>1800. From 1799 to 1801, he served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] of the [[Sixth United States Congress|Congress]]. He famously [[Eulogy|eulogized]] Washington to a crowd of 4,000 at the first President's funeral on December 26, 1799: 
First in war<U+2014>first in peace<U+2014>and first in the hearts of his countrymen...<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/project/exhibit/mourning/response.html |title=Papers of George Washington |publisher=Gwpapers.virginia.edu}}</ref>

The [[Panic of 1796<U+2013>1797]] and bankruptcy of [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] reduced Lee's fortune. He served one year in debtors' prison in [[Montross, Virginia]], when his son Robert Edward was two.<ref>{{citation|url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/lee_henry.html|title= A Princeton Companion(Lee, Henry)|year=1978|accessdate=20 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url= http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/lee_henry.html| title= Stratford Hall/Lee Family Tree: Henry Lee III|accessdate= 20 August 2010}}</ref>

===Death===
On July 27, 1812, Lee received grave injuries while helping to resist an attack on his friend, [[Alexander Contee Hanson]], editor of the Baltimore newspaper, ''The Federal Republican''. Hanson was attacked by [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] mob because his paper opposed the [[War of 1812]]. Lee and Hanson and two dozen other Federalists had taken refuge in the offices of the paper. The group surrendered to Baltimore city officials the next day and were jailed. Laborer George Woolslager led a mob that forced its way into the jail, removed the Federalists, beating and torturing them over the next three hours. All were severely injured, and one Federalist, [[James Lingan]], died.

Lee suffered extensive internal injuries as well as head and face wounds, and even his speech was affected. He later sailed to the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] in an effort to recuperate from his injuries. He died on 25 March 1818, at [[Dungeness (Cumberland Island, Georgia)|Dungeness]], on [[Cumberland Island]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

Lee was buried with full military honors, provided by an American fleet stationed near [[St. Marys, Georgia]]. In 1913 his remains were removed to the Lee family crypt at [[Lee Chapel]], on the campus of [[Washington & Lee University]] in [[Lexington, Virginia]].<ref>[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1972/3/1972_3_26.shtml AmericanHeritage.com / Private Fastness: TALES OF WILD]</ref>

==In popular culture==
The fictional character of Colonel Harry Burwell in the film ''[[The Patriot (2000 film)|The Patriot]]'' is thought{{by whom|date=January 2014}} to have been inspired by the historical exploits of Lee.

In the musical ''[[1776 (musical)|1776]]'' Lee's nickname is mentioned (anachronistically) during the song "The Lees of Old Virginia," sung by the character of his older cousin [[Richard Henry Lee]].
