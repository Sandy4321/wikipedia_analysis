'''Uro<U+0161> Drenovi<U+0107>''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|<U+0423><U+0440><U+043E><U+0448> <U+0414><U+0440><U+0435><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+045B>}}; 11 November 1911&nbsp;<U+2013> 29 May 1944) was a [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serb]] [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav Partisan]] then [[Chetnik]] commander (''vojvoda'') in the Central [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] region of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] puppet state, the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) during [[World War II]]. After distinguishing himself during the initial uprising against the NDH authorities through his capture of [[Mrkonji<U+0107> Grad]] in August 1941, he then led [[Serb]]-chauvinist agitation within the Partisan 3rd Krajina Detachment. After some vacillation, he eventually sided with the pro-Serb Chetniks and was militarily defeated by Partisan forces. In April 1942, he fled to [[Banja Luka]] and concluded an alliance with the NDH authorities to fight the Partisans. He continued to oppose the Partisans until his death during an Allied bombing raid on Banja Luka in May 1944.  

==Early life==
Prior to the outbreak of the war, Drenovi<U+0107> was a schoolmaster from the [[Banja Luka]] area.{{sfn|G-2 (PB)|1944|p=37}}{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=102}}

==Bosanska Krajina uprising==
A matter of months after the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, uprisings began to occur throughout the newly created Axis puppet state, the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-sh-Latn|Nezavisna Dr<U+017E>ava Hrvatska}}, NDH). These uprisings commenced in southwest [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] in late July, and spread across the NDH, with the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] ({{lang-sh-Latn|Komunisti<U+010D>ka partija Jugoslavije|links=no}}, KPJ) organisation being swept along rather than leading the rebellion.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=76}} On 29 August, Drenovi<U+0107> distinguished himself by planning and leading the capture of [[Mrkonji<U+0107> Grad]] by the rebels, but when the town was recaptured by NDH forces four days later, the KPJ blamed him and his troops, citing their poor discipline and anti-Muslim chauvinism.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=250}} In September, four [[battalion]]s of fighters were formed in the [[Ribnik, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ribnik]], Janj and [[Pliva (river)|Pliva]] region. One of these, the 3rd "Petar Ko<U+010D>i<U+0107>" Battalion, was commanded by Drenovi<U+0107>, who, unlike the other battalion commanders in the region, did not allow the KPJ to appoint political commissars to his companies.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|pp=76<U+2013>78}} In an area largely free of KPJ influence, but under the influence of the sectarian Serb elite of Mrkonji<U+0107> Grad, Drenovi<U+0107> arrested Muslim communists in the area, even confronting senior members of the Partisan staff for [[Bosanska Krajina]].{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=102}}  

On 26 September 1941 at Stolice in German-occupied [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|Serbia]], the Partisan leadership decided to standardise its military organisation across occupied Yugoslavia. As result, during October and November, three detachments were formed in the Bosanska Krajina from existing units such as the 3rd "Petar Ko<U+010D>i<U+0107>" Battalion, and Drenovi<U+0107> was appointed as deputy commander of the [[3rd Krajina Detachment (Yugoslav Partisans)|3rd Krajina Detachment]] responsible for the territory of central Bosnia. This region had strong pro-[[Chetnik]] currents, and of the 34 companies in the detachment, only 13 had KPJ organisations, only 11 had commanders that were members of the KPJ, and only 18 had a political commissar. Many KPJ activists in the region were Muslims or Croats, who were not easily accepted by the mass of the rank-and-file who were Serb-chauvinist peasants. Drenovi<U+0107> himself was the leading exponent of Chetnik ideology in Central Bosnia. He despised Muslims and Croats, but was "diplomatic enough to keep his feelings in check when necessary".{{sfn|Hoare|2006|pp=248<U+2013>249}} In October, the Staff of the 3rd Krajina Detachment attempted to win over the Muslim village of [[Crljeni]] by gaining the agreement of the headman to contribute five armed men to the detachment. When the headman reneged on the deal, the detachment attacked the village, but the rest of the detachment had to prevent Drenovi<U+0107>'s battalion from burning and looting it.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=251}}  

On 26 November, at a meeting of the Staff of the 3rd Krajina Detachment, Drenovi<U+0107> advocated collaboration with the Italian occupation forces on the basis that the Italians were protecting Serbs from the Usta<U+0161>e. This was rejected by the senior KPJ members of the staff, but they were not in a position to force him to abandon the idea. At the same meeting, Drenovi<U+0107> refused to commit the 3rd "Petar Ko<U+010D>i<U+0107>" Battalion to fight the Italians. Under pressure, he agreed to advise neighbouring battalions if the Italians moved through his territory. In return, the Staff of the 3rd Krajina Detachment agreed that Drenovi<U+0107> could refer to his force as a "Military-Chetnik Detachment".{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=250}} On 10 December, the senior KPJ members of the 3rd Krajina Detachment concluded that 50 percent of their command staff did not support the leading role of the KPJ in the uprising. The Partisan staff for Bosanska Krajina later observed that the Staff of the 3rd Krajina Detachment had made no effort to remove Chetnik elements from its ranks or stop their Serb-chauvinist agitation.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=250}} In early February 1942, Drenovi<U+0107> took a leading role in a conference intended to bring the 7th Glamo<U+010D> Battalion, which had declared itself as "Chetnik", back into the Partisan structure. Drenovi<U+0107> argued for the Chetnik side, and was expelled from the meeting along with his supporters, and the battalion returned to the fold.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|pp=252<U+2013>253}} On 6 February, a meeting of the leaders of the 1st, 2nd and 4th battalions of the 3rd Krajina Detachment met and decided to bring Drenovi<U+0107> back into the Partisan movement by organising an attack on the Italian and Usta<U+0161>e garrison of Mrkonji<U+0107> Grad. Under pressure from his own rank-and-file, Drenovi<U+0107> formally participated in the attack, but he was able to prevent its success through allowing the Italians to move past his battalion and attack the Partisan rear. According to Partisan sources, he forewarned the Italians and Usta<U+0161>e forces, and divulged the Partisan plan to them.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=254}}

==Alliance with the NDH==
[[File:<U+010C>etnici, domobrani i usta<U+0161>e zajedno piju.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Drenovi<U+0107> (far left) drinking with Croatian Home Guard and Usta<U+0161>e troops|alt=a black and white photograph of uniformed males seated arounf a table, several are holding glasses]]
In response to highly effective pro-Chetnik agitation from within, many Partisan units defected to the Chetniks. In the second half of April 1942, the Partisans responded with aggressive military action against the defectors. The unit that led this offensive was the Grme<U+010D> Shock Anti-Chetnik Battalion, formed earlier that month from wholly loyal and reliable troops. This offensive spelt the end of Drenovi<U+0107>'s "Petar Ko<U+010D>i<U+0107>" Chetnik Detachment, and Drenovi<U+0107> took refuge with the Usta<U+0161>e in Mrkonji<U+0107> Grad.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|pp=261<U+2013>262}} On 27 April, he and other defeated Chetnik commanders signed an agreement with the NDH. The agreement had eight points, requiring that hostilities between the Usta<U+0161>e and Drenovi<U+0107>'s Chetniks come to an end, that NDH forces protect Serb villages from the Partisans and that Usta<U+0161>e units assist the Chetniks in fighting the Partisans.{{sfn|Christia|2012|p=206}}{{sfn|Bari<U+0107>|2011|p=182}} Historian [[Enver Red<U+017E>i<U+0107>]] argues that the agreement was reached out of military and political necessity.{{sfn|Christia|2012|pp=206<U+2013>207}} He writes: "The Usta<U+0161>e<U+2013>Chetnik accords were driven neither by a confluence of Serbian and Croatian national interests nor by mutual desire for acceptance and respect, but rather because each side needed to obstruct Partisan advances. The Usta<U+0161>e and Chetniks, two long-time foes, sought help from one another at a time when the Usta<U+0161>e were facing national political disgrace among the Croats and the Chetniks were losing the support of the Serbs."{{sfn|Red<U+017E>i<U+0107>|2005|p=88}}
[[File:Grob Uro<U+0161>a Drenovi<U+0107>a i crkva Klisina.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Drenovi<U+0107>'s grave in the Klisina Monastery near Prijedor|alt=a grey polished stone grave with a stone-walled church in the background]] 
The NDH authorities considered that the alliance would mean that the Chetniks could continue to subvert Partisan units. On 30 April, the NDH authorities recognised the rights of Drenovi<U+0107> and his troops to remain armed in order to fight the Partisans.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|pp=261<U+2013>262}} The agreement between the NDH and Drenovi<U+0107>'s Chetniks was quickly made public by the entire Usta<U+0161>e press.{{sfn|Dedijer|1990|p=17}} Drenovi<U+0107> soon emerged as one of the most important Chetnik leaders in western Bosnia.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=77}} That summer, when order had been established in significant parts of the Italian occupation zone, Drenovi<U+0107> and other Chetnik detachment leaders and their principal political spokesmen with [[Italian Second Army]] headquarters were recognized by the Italians as [[auxiliaries]] and early in the summer Italian commander [[Mario Roatta]] allowed for the delivery of arms, munitions, and supplies to the Chetniks.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=77}} Other Chetnik leaders in Bosnia who had concluded alliances with the NDH by June 1942 included [[Mane Rokvi<U+0107>]], [[Branko Bogunovi<U+0107>]], [[Stevo Ra<U+0111>anovi<U+0107>]] and [[Mom<U+010D>ilo <U+0110>uji<U+0107>]]. Historian Sabrina P. Ramet observed that this co-operation must be seen as a function of their mutual fear of the Partisans, and emphasized the uncertainty and distrust that accompanied it.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=129}}   

In 1943, Drenovi<U+0107> was awarded the [[Order of the Star of Kara<U+0111>or<U+0111>e]] by King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia]], based on a recommendation by Chetnik leader [[Dra<U+017E>a Mihailovi<U+0107>]].{{sfn|Dedijer|1990|p=17}} There were about 950 Chetniks serving under Drenovi<U+0107> that year, positioned around [[Manja<U+010D>a]] and [[Glamo<U+010D>]].{{sfn|Red<U+017E>i<U+0107>|2005|p=236}} Drenovi<U+0107> had about 400 Chetniks under his command by the following year. His was the only Chetnik band that the Usta<U+0161>e trusted fully during the war.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=354}} According to BN Televizija, Drenovi<U+0107> is considered a Chetnik ''vojvoda''.{{sfn|BN Televizija|2014}}

==Death==
On 29 May 1944, Drenovi<U+0107> was killed in an Allied bombing raid on Banja Luka.{{sfn|Hoare|2013|p=254}} According to a July 2014 article by BN Televizija, the Ravna Gora Movement and [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in Klisina organise a ceremony each year to commemorate Drenovi<U+0107>'s actions in 1941. In 2014, the ceremony was not attended by any officials of the [[Republika Srpska]] entity of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], or by any representatives of the [[Prijedor]] municipality.{{sfn|BN Televizija|2014}}
