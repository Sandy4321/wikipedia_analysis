===Critical assessments===
Sunneg<U+00E5>rdh has a powerful voice that she has described as "like a wild horse"; coaching from her mother was important in enabling her to gain control of it.<ref name=DN1/><ref name=Stepping/> Her first appearance at the Metropolitan Opera was greeted warmly by the audience and most of the press,<ref name=DN2/><ref>Daniel J. Wakin, [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0715FC38540C718CDDAD0894DE404482 "Thrust Onto an Opera Stage, And Greeted by a 'Wall of Love'"], ''The New York Times'', April 2, 2006.</ref> although writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Anthony Tommasini]] found her hesitant, especially in Act One.<ref name=Pressure/> The following year, [[Bernard Holland]] wrote of her first scheduled appearance in ''Turandot'' that she "should be pleased with herself" and that "[s]he is the rare Turandot who both sings like an object of hopeless desire and looks like one".<ref name=Holland/>
