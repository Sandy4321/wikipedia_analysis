Some of her other songs have more modern popular sounds. Her work has been covered by such musicians as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Neko Case]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Chet Atkins]], [[The Indigo Girls]] and [[Joe Cocker]].

She has won recognition and many awards and honours for both her music and her work in education and social activism.

==Personal life==
Buffy Sainte-Marie was born February 20, 1941 on the Piapot [[Cree]] Indian reserve in the [[Qu'Appelle River|Qu'Appelle]] valley, Saskatchewan, Canada. She was orphaned and later adopted, growing up in [[Maine]] with parents Albert and Winifred Sainte-Marie, who were related to her biological parents.<ref name="encyc-great-plains">[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0803247877&id=f1bkxh3NVbIC&pg=PA547&lpg=PA547&ots=fhP7uKLS6t&dq=%22buffy+sainte-marie%22&sig=OrBLXyhEktYOu7J7oLIw4beDm7M Encyclopedia of the Great Plains] entry by Paula Conlon, University of Oklahoma, edited by David J Wishart.</ref> She attended the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], earning degrees in teaching and Oriental philosophy<ref name="moonshot">[http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/moonshot/buffysaintemarie/page4.html Buffy Sainte-Marie biography at www.buffysaintemarie.co.uk].</ref> and graduating in the top ten of her class.<ref name="profiles">[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0825128536&id=v1999R6lT2AC&pg=RA1-PA111&lpg=RA1-PA111&ots=5beFfo-wd5&dq=%22buffy+sainte-marie%22&sig=iqt3eJ3SFAhJvR_gQSADyPwmnIM 45 Profiles in Modern Music] by E.

In 1968 she married surfing teacher Dewain Bugbee of [[Hawaii]]. They divorced in 1971. She married Sheldon Wolfchild from Minnesota in 1975, and they have a son, Dakota "Cody" Starblanket Wolfchild. She married [[Jack Nitzsche]] in the early 1980s. Sainte-Marie has been in a committed relationship with Hawaiian Chuck Wilson since 1993, ("A blond boy raised in a tan community" as Sainte-Marie says).<ref name="DirectorsCut" /> She currently lives on [[Kauai]].<ref>[http://www.nysun.com/comments/29841 Buffy fans Tarantino and Morrissey - Reader comments at The New York Sun<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref>

She became an active friend of the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith]] by the mid-1970s when she is said to have appeared in the 1973 ''Third National Baha<U+2019>i Youth Conference'' at the Oklahoma State Fairgrounds, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and has continued to appear at concerts, conferences and conventions of that religion since then. In 1992 Sainte-Marie appeared in the musical event prelude to the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> World Congress]], a double concert "Live Unity: The Sound of the World" in 1992 with video broadcast and documentary.<ref>[http://info.bahai.org/article-1-9-2-2.html Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s and the Arts: Language of the Heart] by Ann Boyles, also published in 1994-95 edition of ''The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> World'', pp. 243-272.</ref> In the video documentary of the event Sainte-Marie is seen on the ''[[Dini Petty]] Show'' explaining the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> teaching of [[Progressive revelation (Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>)|Progressive revelation]].<ref>''Live Unity:The Sound of the World'' A Concert Documentary, VCR Video, distributed by Unity Arts Inc., of Canada, <U+00A9> Live Unity Enterprises, Inc., 1992.</ref>

In 1996 she received an honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] ''[[Honoris Causa]]'' degree from the [[University of Regina]] in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], Canada. She then gave the convocation address to the administration, education, and engineering graduates. As part of the address, Sainte-Marie sang a song about the [[Canadian Indian residential school system]].

In 2007 she received an honorary [[Doctor of Letters]] from [[Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada.<ref>[http://www.cradleboard.org/2000/press.html Cradleboard Biography of Buffy Sainte-Marie].</ref> On 13 June 2008, she received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from [[Carleton University]], in Ottawa, Canada,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.carleton.ca/duc/newsroom/archive/2008/june5.html | title=Human rights activists to be honoured at Spring Convocation (news release) | accessdate=2008-06-13 | date=5 June 2008 | publisher=[[Carleton University]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080608010412/http://www.carleton.ca/duc/newsroom/archive/2008/june5.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-08}}</ref> an honorary Doctor of Music from The University of Western Ontario on June 10, 2009, in London, Ontario, Canada, and an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts from the [[Ontario College of Art & Design]] on June 4, 2010, in [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ocad.ca/about_ocad/articles/news_releases/20100602_honorary_doctorates_convocation.htm | title=OCAD News Release: OCAD to confer honorary doctorates on Carole Cond<U+00E9>, Karl Beveridge, Anita Kunz and Buffy Sainte-Marie | accessdate=2010-06-06 | date=2 June 2010 }}</ref>

==Early career==
Sainte-Marie played piano and guitar, self-taught, in her childhood and teen years. In college some of her songs, "Ananias", the Indian lament, "Now That the Buffalo's Gone" and "Mayoo Sto Hoon" (in [[Hindi]]) were already in her repertoire.<ref name="moonshot" />

By 1962, in her early twenties, Sainte-Marie was touring alone, developing her craft and performing in various concert halls, folk music festivals and Native Americans reservations across the United States, Canada and abroad. She spent a considerable amount of time in the coffeehouses of downtown Toronto's old [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]] district, and New York City's [[Greenwich Village]] as part of the early to mid-1960s folk scene, often alongside other emerging Canadian contemporaries, such as [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Joni Mitchell]] (including introducing her to manager Eliot Roberts),<ref name="DirectorsCut" /> and [[Neil Young]].

She quickly earned a reputation as a gifted songwriter, and many of her earliest songs were covered, and often turned into chart-topping hits, by other artists including [[Chet Atkins]], [[Janis Joplin]] and [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]]. One of her most popular songs, "[[Until It's Time for You to Go]]", has been recorded by artists as diverse as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]], [[Roberta Flack]], [[Fran<U+00E7>oise Hardy]], [[Cher]], [[Maureen McGovern]], and [[Bobby Darin]], while "Piney Wood Hills" was made into a country music hit by [[Bobby Bare]]. Her vocal style features a frequently recurring, insistent, unusually sustained vibrato, one more prominent than can be found in the music of any other well-known popular music performer.

In 1963, recovering from a throat infection Sainte-Marie became addicted to [[codeine]] and recovering from the experience became the basis of her song "Cod'ine",<ref name="profiles" /> later covered by [[Donovan]], [[The Charlatans (American band)|The Charlatans]], [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], [[Gram Parsons]] as a part of his ''Another Side of This Life: The Lost Recordings of Gram Parsons 1965-1966'', and the songwriter Charles Brutus McClay.<ref>Charles Brutus McClay - "Bottled in France", released 1970 by CBS France, cat.nr.64478.</ref> Also in 1963 Sainte-Marie witnessed wounded soldiers returning from Vietnam at a time when the U.S. government was denying involvement - this inspired her protest song "[[Universal Soldier (song)|Universal Soldier]]"<ref name="blues">[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0312200579&id=9SiONFzWde0C&pg=PA528&lpg=PA528&ots=rmpzaCxcpM&dq=%22buffy+sainte-marie%22&sig=E1W6qGcYYFXqa2pBXR8umShjmuw ''Folk and Blues: The Premier Encyclopedia of American Roots Music''] by Irwin Stambler, Lyndon Stambler, pp. 528-530.</ref> which was released on her debut album, ''[[It's My Way]]'' on [[Vanguard Records]] in 1964, and later became a hit for [[Donovan]]. She was subsequently named [[Billboard Magazine]]'s Best New Artist. Some of her songs such as "[[Little Wheel Spin and Spin|My Country 'Tis of Thy People You're Dying]]" (1964, included on her 1966 album) addressing the plight of the Native American people created a lot of controversy at the time.<ref name="encyc-great-plains" />

In 1967, Sainte-Marie released the album ''Fire and Fleet and Candlelight,'' which contained her interpretation of the traditional [[Yorkshire dialect]] song "[[Lyke Wake Dirge]]". Sainte-Marie's other well-known songs include "[[Mister Can't You See]]," (a [[Top 40]] U.S. hit in 1972); "He's an Indian Cowboy in the Rodeo"; and the theme song of the popular movie ''[[Soldier Blue]]''. Perhaps her first appearance on TV was as herself on ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' in January 1966.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0724292/ "To Tell the Truth" Episode dated 1966-01-24].</ref> She also appeared on [[Pete Seeger]]'s ''Rainbow Quest with Pete Seeger'' in 1965 and several Canadian Television productions from the 1960s through to the 1990s,<ref name="DirectorsCut" /> and sang the opening song "The Circle Game" (written by [[Joni Mitchell]]<ref name="DirectorsCut" />) in Stuart Hagmann's film ''[[The Strawberry Statement]]'' (1970).

In the late sixties, Sainte-Marie used a [[Buchla]] [[synthesizer]] to record the album ''Illuminations'', which did not receive much notice. "People were more in love with the [[Pocahontas]]-with-a-guitar image," she commented in a 1998 interview.

In late 1975, Sainte Marie got a phone call from [[Dulcy Singer]], then [[Associate Producer]] of ''[[Sesame Street]]'', to appear on the show.  According to Sainte-Marie, she wanted her to count and recite the alphabet like everyone else, but instead, she wanted to teach the show's young viewers that "Indians still exist".  Sainte-Marie had been invited earlier that year to appear on another children's TV show which she would not name, but turned the invitation down since the program ran commercials for [[G.I. Joe]] war toys.  

Sainte-Marie regularly appeared on ''[[Sesame Street]]'' over a five year period from 1976<U+2013>1981, along with her first son, Dakota Starblanket Wolfchild whom she breast fed in one episode. ''[[Sesame Street]]'' even aired a week of shows from her home in [[Hawaii]] in December 1977; where Sainte-Marie and her family were joined by Bob ([[Bob McGrath]]), Maria ([[Sonia Manzano]]), Mr. Hooper ([[Will Lee]]), Olivia ([[Alaina Reed Hall]], who was Sainte-Marie's closest friend from the ''[[Sesame Street]]'' cast), Big Bird and Oscar (both portrayed by [[Carroll Spinney]]).

In 1979 the film ''Spirit of the Wind'', featuring Sainte-Marie's original musical score including the song "Spirit of the Wind", was one of three entries that year at Cannes, along with ''[[The China Syndrome]]'' and ''[[Norma Rae]]''. The film is a docudrama of George Attla, the 'winningest dog musher of all time,' as the film presents him, with all parts played by Native Americans except one by [[Slim Pickens]]. The film was shown on cable TV in the early 80's and was released in France in 2003 in 13 major theaters in Paris.  Sainte-Marie's musical score has been described as 'inspiring,'  'haunting', and 'perfection.'<ref>[www.film.com/movies/spirit-of-the-wind/21090379]</ref>  Sainte-Marie began using [[Apple Inc.]] [[Apple II]]<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5072/is_n5_v37/ai_12287153 Names under the sun: Buffy Sainte-Marie - multi-awarded native American singer makes a comeback] Los Angeles Business Journal, May, 1992 by Michael Logan.</ref> and [[Macintosh]] computers as early as 1981 to record her music and later some of her visual art.<ref name="moonshot" />

The song "[[Up Where We Belong]]" (which Sainte-Marie co-wrote with [[Will Jennings]] and musician [[Jack Nitzsche]]) was performed by [[Joe Cocker]] and [[Jennifer Warnes]] for the film ''[[An Officer and a Gentleman]]''. It received the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Best Song]] in 1982. The song was later covered by [[Cliff Richard]] and [[Anne Murray]] on Cliff's album of duets, ''Two's Company''.

In the early 1980s one of her inspirational native songs was used as the theme song for the [[CBC Television|CBC]]'s native series [[Spirit Bay (TV series)|Spirit Bay]]. She was cast for the [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] 1993 telefilm ''The Broken Chain''. It was shot entirely in [[Virginia]].

In 1989 she wrote and performed the music for ''[[Where the Spirit Lives]]'' a film about native children being abducted and forced into residential schools.

==Later career==
Sainte-Marie voiced the Cheyenne character, Kate Bighead, in the 1991 made-for-TV movie ''[[Son of the Morning Star]]'', telling the Indian side of the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], where [[George Armstrong Custer|Lt. Col. George Custer]] was killed.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102962/ IMDB entry, ''Son of the Morning Star'']</ref>

In 1992, after a sixteen-year recording hiatus, Sainte-Marie released the album ''[[Coincidence and Likely Stories]]''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Recorded in 1990 at home in Hawaii on her computer and transmitted via modem through the early Internet to producer Chris Birkett in London, England,<ref name="DirectorsCut" /> the album included the politically-charged songs "The Big Ones Get Away" and "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee" (which mentions [[Leonard Peltier]]), both commenting on the ongoing plight of Native Americans (see also the book ''[[Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee]]''.) Also in 1992, Sainte-Marie appeared in the television film ''The Broken Chain'' with [[Pierce Brosnan]] along with fellow First Nations Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> [[Phil Lucas]]. Her next album followed up in 1996 with ''Up Where We Belong'', an album on which she re-recorded a number of her greatest hits in more unplugged and acoustic versions, including a re-release of "[[Universal Soldier (song)|Universal Soldier]]".

A gifted [[digital artist]], Sainte-Marie has exhibited her art at the [[Glenbow Museum]] in [[Calgary]], the [[Winnipeg Art Gallery]], the [[Emily Carr]] Gallery in [[Vancouver]] and the American Indian Arts Museum in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]].

In 1969 she started a philanthropic non-profit fund [[Nihewan Foundation for American Indian Education]] devoted to improving Native American students participation in learning.<ref>http://www.nihewan.com Nihewan Foundation.</ref>  She founded the [[Cradleboard Teaching Project]] in October 1996 using funds from her Nihewan Foundation and with a two year grant from the [[W.K. Kellogg Foundation]] of [[Battle Creek, Michigan]]. With projects across [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], [[Cree]], [[Ojibwe]], [[Menominee]], [[Coeur D'Alene Tribe|Coeur D'Alene]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]], [[Quinault (tribe)|Quinault]], [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]], and [[Apache]] communities in eleven states, partnered with a non-native class of the same grade level for [[Elementary school|Elementary]], [[Middle school|Middle]], and [[High School]] grades in the disciplines of Geography, History, Social Studies, Music and Science and produced a multimedia curriculum CD, ''Science: Through Native American Eyes''.<ref>[http://www.cradleboard.org/2000/history.html Cradleboard History] by Buffy Sainte-Marie.</ref>

In 2000, Sainte-Marie gave the commencement address at [[Haskell Indian Nations University]].<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4179/is_20000513/ai_n11747327 New generation of Haskell family honored] Topeka Capital-Journal, The, May 13, 2000 by Andrea Albright Capital-Journal.</ref> In 2002 she sang at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] for Commander [[John Herrington]],USN, a [[Chickasaw]] and the first Native American astronaut.<ref>[http://www.mouthbow.org/buffycape.html posted at the Youth Council on Race site] by Buffy Sainte-Marie.</ref> In 2003 she became a spokesperson for the [[UNESCO]] [[UNESCO ASPNet|Associated Schools Project Network]] in Canada.<ref>[http://www.cradleboard.org/press/unesco.html Nihewan Foundation For Native American Education Cradleboard Teaching Project].</ref>

In 2004, a track written and performed by her and entitled "Lazarus" was sampled by [[Hip hop music|Hip Hop]] producer [[Kanye West]] and performed by [[Cam'Ron]] and Jim Jones of [[The Diplomats]]. The track is called "Dead or Alive". In June 2007, Sainte-Marie made a rare United States appearance at the [[Clearwater Festival]] in [[Croton-on-Hudson]], NY.

In 2008, a two-CD set titled ''Buffy/Changing Woman/Sweet America: The Mid-1970s Recordings'' was released, compiling the three studio albums that she recorded for [[ABC Records]] and [[MCA Records]] between 1974 and 1976 (after departing her long-time label [[Vanguard Records]]). This was the first re-release of this material.

In Sept 2008 in Canada, Sainte-Marie made a comeback onto the music scene with the release of her latest studio album ''[[Running For The Drum]]''. It was produced by Chris Birkett (producer of her 1992 and 1996 [[best of]] albums). Sessions for this latest project commenced in 2006 in Sainte-Marie's home studio in Hawaii and in part in France. They continued until spring 2007.

==Censorship==
Sainte-Marie claimed in a 2008 interview at the [[National Museum of the American Indian]]<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5_3IhqNZKI 2008 Native Writer's Series #3 - Buffy Sainte-Marie].</ref> that she had been blacklisted and that she, along with other Native Americans and native people in the Red Power movements, were put out of business in the 1970s.

"I found out 10 years later, in the 1980s, that President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had been writing letters on White House stationery praising radio stations for suppressing my music", Sainte-Marie said in a 1999 interview at [[Din<U+00E9> College]] given to Brenda Norrel, a staff writer with Indian Country Today ... "In the 1970s, not only was the protest movement put out of business, but the Native American movement was attacked."<ref>[http://bsnorrell.blogspot.com/2008/10/canadian-aboriginal-music-awards-is.html?showComment=1224884880000 Beyond images of women and Indians: Straight-talk from a Cree icon].</ref> According to Norrel, this article was initially censored by ''[[Indian Country Today]]'', and finally published only in part in 2006.

==Awards and honors==
In 1997, Sainte-Marie won a [[Gemini Award]] for her 1996 variety special, ''Up Where We Belong''.<ref>[http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0003082 Sainte-Marie, Buffy], ''The Encyclopedia of Music in Canada''.</ref>

In 1983-4, the song "[[Up Where We Belong]]" (music by [[Jack Nitzsche]] and Buffy Sainte-Marie; lyrics by [[Will Jennings]]) from ''[[An Officer and a Gentleman]]'' won an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a BAFTA Film Award for Best Original Song.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0756763/awards Buffy Sainye-Marie], IMDb</ref>
