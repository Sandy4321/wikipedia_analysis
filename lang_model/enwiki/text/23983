== Canada ==

In Canada, community colleges are usually simply referred to as "colleges". This is because in Canadian English, there is formal differentiation between the term "college" (referring to a community college) and a University, that is not present in American English. {{Fact|date=August 2007}} In the province of Quebec, they are called [[CEGEP|C<U+00E9>geps]] for Coll<U+00E8>ge d'enseignement g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ral et professionnel, meaning "College of General and Vocational Education"

In [[Canada]], and also in the [[United States]], a community college, sometimes called a '''county college''', '''junior college''', '''technical college''', or a '''city college''', is an educational institution providing [[higher education]] and lower-level [[tertiary education]], granting [[certificate]]s, [[diploma]]s, and in the United States [[associate's degrees]]; in Canada, the associates' degree is rare and community colleges increasingly offer limited selections of specialized [[bachelor's degrees]]. The name derives from the fact that community colleges primarily attract and accept students from the local [[community]], and are often supported by local tax revenue.

{{main|Community college (Malaysia)}}
Community colleges in Malaysia are a network of educational institutions whereby vocational and technical skills training could be provided at all levels for school leavers before they entered the workforce. The community colleges also provide an infrastructure for rural communities to gain skills training through short courses as well as providing access to a post-secondary education.

At the moment, most community colleges award qualifications up to Level 3 in the [[Malaysian Qualifications Framework]] (Certificate 3) in both the Skills sector (Sijil Kemahiran Malaysia or the Malaysian Skills Certificate) as well as the Vocational and Training sector but the number of community colleges that are starting to award Level 4 qualifications (Diploma) are increasing. This is two levels below a Bachelor's degree (Level 6 in the MQF) and students within the system who intend to further their studies to that level will usually seek entry into Advanced Diploma programs in public universities, polytechnics or accredited private providers.

The concept of community college dates back to the time of the former '''Minister of Education, Culture and Sports (MECS)''' that had under its wings the Bureaus of Elementary Education, Secondary Education, Higher Education and Vocational-Technical Education. MECS Secretary, Dr. Cecilio Putong, who in 1971 wrote that a community school is a school established in the community, by the community, an for the community itself. Dr. Pedro T. Orata of Pangasinan shared the same idea, hence the establishment of a Community College, now called the City College of Urdaneta.<ref name="alcu"/>

A community college like the one in [[Abuyog]], [[Leyte]] can operate with only [[PHP]] 124,000 annual budget in a 2-storey structure housing more than 700 students.<ref name="alcu"/>
