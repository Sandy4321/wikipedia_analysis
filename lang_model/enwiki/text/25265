== Biography ==
=== Early career ===
Fanning was born in [[Conyers, Georgia]], to Steven Fanning (a former [[baseball]] player who now works as an electronics salesman in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]) and Joy Fanning, who played [[tennis]] professionally. Her mother had wanted to name her "Hannah" and her father wanted to name her "Dakota"; she has always used Dakota among her friends and family. Her younger sister, [[Elle Fanning|Elle]], is also an actress. Fanning is of half [[German American|German]] descent and her last name is of [[Irish American|Irish]] origin.<ref name="timess">{{cite web | publisher=timessquare.com | title=Dakota Fanning Lives Out Her Dreams | url=http://www.timessquare.com/movies/dakota_fanning/index.html | accessdate=July 21 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Dakota and her family are [[Baptist]]s, members of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]].<ref name="lifeteen">{{cite web | publisher=lifeteen.com | title=Interview: Dakota Fanning | url=http://www.lifeteen.com/default.aspx?PageID=FEATUREDETAIL&__DocumentId=106317&__ArticleIndex=0 | accessdate=July 19 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Fanning began acting at the age of five after appearing with legendary musician [[Ray Charles]] in a [[television commercial]] for the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] State [[Lottery]]<ref name="georgia">{{cite web | publisher=Shoot magazine via findarticles.com | title=Winning Numbers | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DUO/is_13_41/ai_61693322  | accessdate=March 13 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and being chosen for a [[Tide (detergent)|Tide]] [[television commercial|commercial]]. Her first significant acting job was a [[guest star|guest-starring]] role in the [[NBC]] [[prime time|prime-time]] [[drama]], ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', which remains one of her favorite roles ("I played a car accident victim who has [[leukemia]]. I got to wear a neck brace and nose tubes for the two days I worked.")<ref name="jam">{{cite web | publisher=Jam!

Fanning subsequently had several guest roles on established television series, including ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'', ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[The Practice]]'', ''[[Spin City]]'' and ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]''. She also portrayed the title characters of ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' and ''[[The Ellen Show]]'' as young girls. In 2001, Fanning was chosen to star opposite [[Sean Penn]] in ''[[I Am Sam]]'', the story of a mentally impaired man who fights for the custody of his daughter (played by Fanning). This role made Fanning the youngest person (in 2002, at age eight) ever to be nominated for a [[Screen Actors Guild]] Award, for her supporting performance. When she won the Best Young Actor/Actress award from the [[Broadcast Film Critics Association]] for the film, she was too short to reach the microphone; presenter [[Orlando Bloom]] held her up for the duration of her acceptance speech.

=== 2002<U+2013>2003 ===
In 2002, director [[Steven Spielberg]] cast Fanning in the lead child role of Allison "Allie" Clarke/Keys in the [[science fiction]] [[miniseries]] ''[[Taken]]''. By this time, she had received positive notices by several film critics, including Tom Shales of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', who wrote that Fanning "has the perfect sort of otherworldly look about her, an enchanting young actress called upon ... to carry a great weight."<ref name="post">{{cite web | publisher=The Washington Post via virtuallystrange.net | title=Sci Fi's 'Taken' Grabs You and Doesn't Let Go | url=http://www.virtuallystrange.net/ufo/updates/2002/dec/m03-004.shtml | accessdate=March 13 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In the same year, Fanning appeared in three films: As a kidnap victim who proves to be more than her abductors bargained for in ''[[Trapped (film)|Trapped]]''; as the young version of [[Reese Witherspoon]]'s character in ''[[Sweet Home Alabama (film)|Sweet Home Alabama]]''. Fanning was featured even more prominently in two films released in 2003: Playing the uptight child to [[Brittany Murphy]]'s immature nanny in ''[[Uptown Girls]]'', and as Sally in ''[[The Cat in the Hat#Film|The Cat in the Hat]]''. She appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show With Jay Leno]]'' on [[November 10]] [[2003]], where she declared that she and her sister share a room, and described ''The Cat in the Hat'' co-star [[Mike Myers]] as "very funny."

Fanning did [[voice-over]] work for four [[animation|animated]] projects during this period: As Satsuki in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s [[English language]] release of ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'', as Kim Possible in [[nursery school|preschool]] in the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[Kim Possible]]'', as a little girl in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] series ''[[Family Guy]]'', and as young [[Wonder Woman]] in an episode of [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Justice League]]''.

=== 2004<U+2013>present ===
In 2004, Fanning appeared in ''[[Man on Fire (2004 film)|Man on Fire]]'' as Pita, a nine-year-old who wins over the heart of the retired [[assassination|assassin]] ([[Denzel Washington]]) hired to protect her from kidnappers. [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that Fanning "is a pro at only 10 years old, and creates a heart-winning character."<ref name="ebert">{{cite web | publisher=rogerebert.com | title=Man on Fire (review) | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040423/REVIEWS/404230302/1023 | accessdate=March 13 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> ''[[Hide and Seek (2005 film)|Hide and Seek]]'', was her first release in 2005, opposite [[Robert De Niro]]. Though the film was generally panned, critic Chuck Wilson called it "a fascinating meeting of equals<U+2014>if the child star [Fanning] challenged the master [De Niro] to a game of stare-down, the legend might very well blink first."<ref name="laweekly">{{cite web | publisher=laweekly.com | title=Hide and Seek review | url=http://www.laweekly.com/film/film_results.php?showid=3257 | accessdate=March 13 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Fanning voiced Lilo (succeeding [[Daveigh Chase]]) in the [[direct-to-video]] film ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]''. She also had a small part in the Rodrigo Garcia film ''[[Nine Lives (2005 film)|Nine Lives]]'' (released in October 2005), in which she shared an unbroken nine-minute scene with actress [[Glenn Close]], who had her own praise for Fanning:  "She's definitely an old soul.  She's one of those gifted people that come along every now and then."<ref name="close">{{cite web | publisher=monstersandcritics.com | title=Glenn Close raves about Dakota Fanning | url=http://movies.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1049828.php | accessdate=March 13 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

[[Image:WotW_pub.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Fanning in ''War of the Worlds''; Director Steven Spielberg praised her ability to show "how she would really react in a real situation".]]
Fanning completed filming on ''[[Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story]]'' (opposite [[Kurt Russell]]) in late October 2004. ([[Kris Kristofferson]], who plays her character's grandfather in the movie, said that she's like [[Bette Davis]] [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]].)<ref name="bette">{{cite web | publisher=reel.com | title= Dreamer: Inspired By a True Story (2005) DVD Review | url=http://www.reel.com/movie.asp?MID=141246&PID=10121575&Tab=reviews&CID=18 | accessdate=January 28 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> She then went directly to the set of ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'', starring alongside [[Tom Cruise]]. Released in reverse order (''War'' in June of 2005 and ''Dreamer'' in the following October), both films were critical successes.''War'' director [[Steven Spielberg]] praised "how quickly she understands the situation in a sequence, how quickly she sizes it up, measures it up and how she would really react in a real situation".<ref name="comingsoonet">{{cite web | publisher=comingsoon.net | title=War of the Worlds: Spielberg & Cruise - Part I  | url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news.php?id=10136 | accessdate=March 13 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

After filming was completed on ''War of the Worlds'', Fanning moved straight to another film, without a break: ''[[Charlotte's Web (2006 film)|Charlotte's Web]]'', which she finished filming in May 2005, in [[Australia]].  Released on December 15th, 2006, ''Web'' met generally warm critical acclaim.  Producer Jordan Kerner said, "...when she was so caught up in ''War of the Worlds'', we had to end up going on a search for other young actresses.  They would have been nothing compared to her."<ref name="Moviehole.net">{{cite web | publisher=moviehole.net | title=Exclusive Interview : Jordan Kerner | url=http://www.moviehole.net/interviews/20061204_exclusive_interview_jordan_ker.html | accessdate=December 15 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Announced in October 2005, Fanning is slated to provide voice work for ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'', scheduled for release sometime in 2008.<ref name="coraline">{{cite web | publisher=about.com | title=Dakota Fanning Signs on to "Coraline" | url=http://movies.about.com/od/moviesinproduction/a/coraline102505.htm | accessdate=March 13 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Over the summer of 2006, Fanning worked on the film ''[[Hounddog (2007 film)|Hounddog]]'', described in press reports as a "dark story of abuse, violence and [[Elvis Presley]] adulation in the rural South". Fanning's agent noted that the script is "challenging" to Fanning as an actress.<ref name="hounddog">{{cite web | publisher=nydailynews.com | title=All shook up over Dakota's Hounddog | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/436645p-367837c.html | accessdate=July 20 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Fanning's parents have been criticized for allowing her to film a scene in which her character is raped; Fanning called that an "attack". "It's not really happening," she told [[Reuters]]. "It's a movie, and it's called acting."<ref name="attack">{{cite web | publisher=cnn.com | title=Dakota Fanning: 'It's called acting' | url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/01/24/sundance.fanning.ap/ | accessdate=January 29 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Director Deborah Kampmeier addressed the controversy in the January 2007 edition of ''Premiere'': "The assumption that [Dakota] was violated in order to give this performance denies her talent."<ref name="premiere">{{cite news | title=No More Kid Stuff | publisher=Premiere | date=[[January 2007]]}}</ref>

In November 2006, Dakota said she had a small break and wanted to get busy once again.<ref name="LA Daily News">{{cite web | publisher=dailynews.com | title=With 'Six Feet' over, he's back | url=http://www.dailynews.com/celebrities/ci_4612005 | accessdate=November 17 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> During her ''[[Charlotte's Web (2006 film)|Charlotte's Web]]'' press run in December 2006, she mentioned two future films: they include ''[[The Secret Life of Bees]]'' and possibly ''[[Taking Sides]]'', a  follow-up project with [[Gary Winick]].<ref name="The Reeler">{{cite web | publisher=thereeler.com | title=NYC Premiere: Charlotte's Web | url=http://www.thereeler.com/premieres_events/nyc_premiere_charlottes_web.php | accessdate=December 5 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Dakota detailed her involvement in ''Bees'' in the January 2007 edition of [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]].
