'''KXSS-FM''' (96.9 [[FM broadcasting|FM]], "96.9 KISS-FM") is a [[Contemporary Hit Radio|Top 40 (CHR)]] formatted [[radio station]] serving the [[Amarillo, Texas]], market.  KXSS-FM is owned by [[Townsquare Media]].

The station primarily competes with [[Cumulus Media]]'s [[KQIZ]] in the [[Top 40]] format (KQIZ, by the way, offers a [[Rhythmic Contemporary|rhythmic]] direction).  Coincidentally, both stations transmit from the same tower site,<ref>{{cite web |title=KQIZ Radio-Locator |url=http://www.radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/info?call=KQIZ&service=FM |accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref> which is highly unusual.

The 96.9 frequency was, until 2008, home to a [[country music]] format as "96.9 KMML," under the ownership of [[Clear Channel Communications]], however it was one of close to 450 radio stations sold by Clear Channel in the process of privatization, beginning in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wikipedia Article on Clear Channel Communications |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear_Channel_Communications#Clear_Channel_Sale |accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref>  KXSS, along with its sister stations [[KPRF-FM]], [[KATP-FM]], [[KMXJ-FM]], and KIXZ-AM, was acquired along with approximately fifty other stations by [[Gap Broadcasting]] for a total price of $139M.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stations Close Sale 10/05/07 |url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/100507/bus_86232821.shtml |accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref>  What eventually became Gap Central Broadcasting (following the formation of [[GapWest Broadcasting]]) was folded into [[Townsquare Media]] on August 13, 2010.<ref name="rbr-gaptownsquare">{{cite news|title=Townsquare Media completes roll-up of GAP|url=http://www.rbr.com/radio/radio_deals/26710.html|accessdate=August 15, 2010|newspaper=Radio Business Report|date=August 13, 2010}}</ref>

The KMML call sign has been reissued to a radio station in Cimarron, Kansas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/finder?sr=Y&s=C&call=KMML |work=Radio-Locator |title=KMML-FM: Radio Station Information Page}}</ref>
