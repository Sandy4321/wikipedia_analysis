The '''Battle of Stony Point'''  was a battle of the [[American Revolutionary War]] fought on the night of July 15<U+2013>16, 1779. A select force of Continental Army infantry made a coordinated surprise night attack and stormed a fortified position of the [[British Army]] on the [[Hudson River]] near [[West Point, New York]]. The position was taken in 25 minutes with the loss to the British of nearly an entire regiment of infantry.

Although the position, commanding a key ferry crossing point of the Hudson, was abandoned three days after its capture, British commanders later in the year concluded that it was defensibly untenable and evacuated it permanently. The crossing was used by the [[Continental Army]] in its march to [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]], Virginia, two years later.

==Background==
===British dispositions===
In late May, 1779, British Lieutenant General [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton]] sent a force of about 8,000 men up the North (or Hudson) River with the intention of drawing General [[George Washington]]<U+2019>s [[Continental Army]] out of their mountain garrisons and into open battle. By June 1 British forces had seized and begun fortifying [[Stony Point Battlefield|Stony Point]] on the west side of the river and [[Verplanck, New York|Verplanck<U+2019>s Point]] on the east bank. This move effectively closed King<U+2019>s Ferry, a major river crossing at that narrow point in the river, about 10 miles (16&nbsp;km) south of [[United States Military Academy#History|West Point]] and 35 miles (56&nbsp;km) north of New York City.

Stony Point was garrisoned with elements of the [[17th Regiment of Foot]] under the command of Lt. Col. Henry Johnson. The 17th was reinforced there by a grenadier company belonging to one of the two battalions of the[[71st Regiment of Foot, Fraser's Highlanders|71st Regiment]], a company-strength detachment of the [[Loyal American Regiment]], and a detachment of the [[Royal Artillery]] manned fifteen field pieces that included five iron and two brass cannon, four mortars and four small howitzers. A [[Royal Navy]] gunboat was assigned to protect the river approaches to the fortifications, and the armed sloop ''Vulture'' was also anchored in that part of the river.

Washington observed construction of the fortifications through a telescope from atop nearby [[Buckberg]] Mountain. Historians also believe he used intelligence gathered from local merchants to get a better idea of the strength of the garrison, the types of watchwords in use, and the placement of sentries <U+2013> especially on the south side of the point, which could not be seen from Buckberg. During this time he formulated a plan of attack and selected a commander to lead it <U+2013> Major General [[Anthony Wayne]] of [[Pennsylvania]].

The British position at Stony Point was a fortified one, but it was never intended to be a true fort in the 18th Century European sense of the word. No stone was used and no walls were constructed. The defenses consisted of earthen fleches (cannon positions) and wooden [[abatis]] (felled trees sharpened to a point and placed in earthen embankments). The defenses were situated a rocky elevation approachable only from the west, protected in the front by a watery defile and on both flanks by extensive swampy areas.

===American forces and tactics===
To storm the position, the [[List of Continental Army units#Light infantry|Corps of Light Infantry]] was formed on June 12, 1779, with command assigned to Brigadier General Anthony Wayne, commander of the Pennsylvania Line, on July 11. The Corps of Light Infantry was a seasonal combat organization drafted in each of the years between 1777 and 1781 from the light infantry companies of each regiment of the Continental Line's Main Army.<ref>The Light Infantry Brigade of 1777 was formed on August 24 by selecting 100 men from each of ten brigades, commanded by Brig-Gen. [[William Maxwell]], to provide skirmishers at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] in the absence of [[Daniel Morgan]]'s riflemen. The Light Infantry Corps in 1778 was drawn on June 25 from companies of Virginia Continentals under the command of Brig-Gen. [[Charles Scott]] to harry the British retreat across New Jersey leading up to the [[Battle of Monmouth]].</ref> The 1779 Corps was organized into a brigade of four regiments, each composed of two battalions of four companies, with the following order of battle:<ref>Companies from New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire were serving in Pennsylvania with the [[Sullivan Expedition]] and were not available for the 1779 Corps.</ref>
*1st Regiment, commanded by Col. [[Christian Febiger]] of the [[2nd Virginia Regiment]], six companies of Virginia and two of Pennsylvania troops;
*2nd Regiment, Col. [[Richard Butler (general)|Richard Butler]] ([[9th Pennsylvania Regiment]]), four companies each of Pennsylvanians and of Marylanders;<ref>The Maryland companies included selected members of the Delaware Line.</ref>
*3rd Regiment, Col. [[Return J. Meigs, Sr.|Return Jonathan Meigs]] ([[6th Connecticut Regiment]]), eight companies of Connecticut troops;
*4th Regiment, a partially organized detachment of six companies of Massachusetts troops and two of North Carolina, temporarily commanded by Major [[William Hull]] ([[8th Massachusetts Regiment]]). The 4th Regiment was fully organized in August and assigned to the command of Col. [[Rufus Putnam]].<ref>The 1779 Corps of Light Infantry was dissolved in December 1779.</ref>

The attack plan called for a night attack on the fortifications to be carried out by the 1,350 men of the corps.<ref>Each regiment consisted of 300 to 340 men, and the total force included an artillery detachment to man captured British field pieces.</ref> According to 18th Century military doctrine, this was not enough men to take a well-prepared defensive position, but in addition to the element of surprise, Washington<U+2019>s plan exploited a fatal flaw in the fortifications. The wooden abatis along the southern shore of the point was not extended into the deep water of the Hudson and could be outflanked by attackers along a narrow beach at low tide. The main attack would be along this approach, but Washington advised that if practicable, secondary and diversionary attacks could also be made along the north shore of the point and across the causeway to the center. 

Washington gave Wayne his instructions, along with permission to modify the plan as necessary. This was an unusual act for Washington, and indicates the high opinion he had of Wayne<U+2019>s tactical abilities. The assault would be difficult: It would be carried out in the dead of night, called for the men to scale the steep, rocky sides of Stony Point, and required surprise. To accomplish this last element, Washington ordered that the men attack using only bayonets in order to prevent a [[musket]] blast from alerting British sentries. Despite the difficulty of the plan, Wayne ordered the two companies of North Carolina light infantry to detach themselves from the northern column, cross the causeway, and stage a demonstration attack at the center of the British defenses, where the British expected an attack to come. This battalion, commanded by Maj. [[Hardy Murfree]], was instructed to lay down a "gauling fire" with their weapons as a diversionary tactic. 

Wayne selected Butler's 2nd Regiment of approximately 300 men to conduct an assault along the northern shore of the point, while Wayne himself would lead the main column in the south, consisting of the 1st and 3rd Regiments, and Hull's detachment of Massachusetts light infantry. The columns deployed an advance force of 100 and 150 men respectively wielding axes to clear obstacles, with 20 men from each advance force assigned as the [[forlorn hope]]s, to protect the force and to be the first to enter the works.

==Battle==
[[File:Battle of Stony Point.USMA.edu.history.gif|thumb|left|300px|The Battle of Stony Point on 16 July 1779]]
After a morning muster, on July 15, 1779, the Corps of Light Infantry marched from Sandy Beach north of [[Fort Montgomery, New York|Fort Montgomery]] beginning at noon. Any civilians met along the route of march were to be taken into custody to prevent them from warning the British. The column, often forced to march single file over rough terrain and roads hardly more than paths, took a circuitous route west through Queensboro to the west and over Dunderberg Mountain to avoid detection by the British. The Corps began arriving at 8 p.m. at the Springsteel farm, a mile and a half west of the fortifications, and by 10 p.m. had been formed in the attack columns. The men were given a [[rum]] ration and their orders. They were also given pieces of white paper to pin to their hats in order to help them tell each other from the British in the darkness. The columns then moved out at 11:30 p.m. to their jump-off points, diverging immediately, to begin the assault at midnight.

Bad weather that night aided the Continentals. Cloud cover cut off moonlight and high winds forced the British ships in [[Haverstraw Bay]] to leave their posts off Stony Point and move downriver. At midnight, as scheduled, the attack began with the columns crossing the swampy flanks of the point. The southern column unexpectedly found its approach inundated in two to four feet of water and required thirty minutes to wade to the first line of abatis, during which it and Murfree<U+2019>s demonstration force were spotted by British sentries and fired upon. Under fire Wayne<U+2019>s column succeeded in getting inside the British first line of defenses. Wayne himself was struck in the head by a spent musket ball and fell to the ground, leaving Col. Febiger to take over command of Wayne<U+2019>s column. Meanwhile, Butler<U+2019>s column had succeeded in cutting its way through the abatis, sustaining the only loss of life on the American side while doing so. The two columns penetrated the British line almost simultaneously and seized the summit when six companies of the 17th Regiment of Foot took positions opposite the diversionary attack and were cut off. 

[[File:Battle of Stony Point - British Assuslt.Dean.USMA.edu.history.gif|thumb|right|300px|The British assault on Stony Point]]

The first man into the British upper works was Lt. Col. [[Francois de Fleury]], an aristocrat French [[combat engineer|engineer]] commanding a battalion of the 1st Regiment. He was followed by [[Peter Francisco]], Lt. Henry Knox,  Sgt. William Baker and George Dunlop <U+2013> all of whom earned cash prizes for their accomplishment. As the men entered the British works they called out, <U+201C>The fort<U+2019>s our own!<U+201D> <U+2013> the prearranged [[password|watchword]] to distinguish friend from foe. The action lasted 25 minutes and was over by 1 a.m., and proved to be the major engagement of 1779, one of the last major battles of the War in the Northern Theater.

Wayne's losses were 15 killed and 83 wounded<ref>Boatner, Mark Mayo, ''Cassell<U+2019>s Biographical Dictionary of the American War of Independence 1763-1783'', Cassell, London, 1966, ISBN 0 304 29296 6, page 1066</ref>. 546 prisoners were taken, 74 of whom were wounded <ref name="Boatner, page 1066">Boatner, page 1066</ref>. Some Patriot sources stated that there were 63 British dead <ref name="Boatner, page 1066"/> but military historian Mark M. Boatner accepts the official British report of 20 killed <ref name="Boatner, page 1066"/>. However, the report (from Lt-Col. Johnson to Sir Henry Clinton on July 24, 1779) also lists 58 missing separate from killed, wounded, and captured, many of whom may have drowned in the Hudson<ref>Johnston, Henry Phelps (1900). ''The Storming of Stony Point on the Hudson'', "Authorities: No. 9. Lieutenant-Colonel Johnson's Report on the Loss of Stony Point", James T. White & Co., New York City, pp. 127-129.</ref>.

==Aftermath==
Before dawn, Wayne sent a brief dispatch telling Washington, <U+201C>The fort and garrison, with Col. Johnson, are ours. The men behaved like men determined to be free.<U+201D> The next day, Washington rode into the works to inspect the battlefield and congratulate the troops. For his exploits, Wayne was awarded a medal by Congress, one of the few issued during the Revolution.

The Continentals, not having enough men to defend the site from being cut off to the west, chose to abandon it on July 18, after carrying off the cannon and supplies captured there. The British briefly reoccupied the site only to abandon it shortly afterward as untenable when Clinton redeployed troops to the southern states in anticipation of a French invasion.

Some of the captured officers were exchanged immediately after the battle, but the more than 400 prisoners of other ranks were marched off to a prison camp at [[Easton, Pennsylvania]]. An unsuccessful attempt by a small number of prisoners on July 17 to overpower their captors resulted in one British sergeant killed and about 20 other ranks wounded.

Contemporary Patriot accounts note that Wayne had given quarter to the garrison of Stony Point despite the alleged treatment of his own men at the "[[Paoli Massacre]]" in 1777. (One asserted that [[King George III]] fought back tears when he heard of the <U+201C>mercy<U+201D> that had been shown to his troops).<ref>Loprieno, Don, ''The Enterprise in Contemplation: The Midnight Assault of Stony Point'', Heritage Books Inc., 2004, ISBN 0788425749, ISBN 978-0788425745</ref> British reports also remarked that unanticipated clemency was immediately shown the garrison<ref>Johnston (1900).

===State Historic Site===
The [[Stony Point Battlefield|Stony Point State Historic Site]] is located at the former battlefield and has interpretive materials, tours, and demonstrations, primarily during the summer season. A museum on the site features artifacts from the battle, including a howitzer and two mortars.
