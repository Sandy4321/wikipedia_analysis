'''Antony Harold Curties "Tony" Windsor''' (born [[2 September]] [[1950]]), [[Australia]]n politician, has been an independent member of the 
[[Australian House of Representatives]] since [[2001]], representing the [[Division of New England]], [[New South Wales]]. He was born in [[Quirindi, New South Wales|Quirindi]], [[New South Wales]], and was educated at the [[University of New England, Australia|University of New England]]. He was a farmer before entering politics. 

In May [[1991]], Windsor was first elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] as the independent [[Electoral district of Tamworth|Member for Tamworth]]. Windsor was originally the preferred candidate of The Nationals for this seat, though was replaced at the last moment due to allegations in regards to a drink-driving incident on the day of his pre-selection.   He held this seat for ten years before resigning in September, [[2001]], to contest the [[Division of New England|federal seat of New England]]. He won the seat, and in doing so, defeated incumbent [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] MP [[Stuart St. Clair]]. The National Party and its predecessor, the Country Party, had held New England continuously since [[1922]].  

In September [[2004]], Windsor claimed that he had been approached by a figure associated with the National Party with the offer of a diplomatic position in exchange for retiring from politics. He said that he would name those he claims are involved if forced at an inquiry. The [[Australian Electoral Commission]] referred the matter to the [[Australian Federal Police]]. In November, speaking under [[parliamentary privilege]], Windsor said that National Party leader [[John Anderson (Australian politician)|John Anderson]] and National Party Senator [[Sandy Macdonald]] had made through the offer through an intermediary, [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]] businessman [[Greg McGuire]]. Anderson, MacDonald and McGuire denied the claims. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions found that there was no ''[[Prima facie]]'' case against the three men.
