'''Anna Wintour''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born November 3, 1949) is the British-born [[editor-in-chief]] of American ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', a position she has held since 1988. With her trademark [[pageboy]] [[bob cut|bob haircut]] and sunglasses, Wintour has become an institution throughout the fashion world, widely praised for her eye for fashion trends and her support for younger [[fashion designer|designers]]. Her reportedly aloof and demanding personality has earned her the nickname "Nuclear Wintour".

She is the eldest daughter of [[Charles Wintour]], editor of the London ''[[Evening Standard]]''. Anna became interested in fashion as a teenager. Her father consulted her on how to make the newspaper relevant to the youth of the era. Her career in [[fashion journalism]] began at two British magazines. Later she moved to the United States, with stints at ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' and ''[[House & Garden (magazine)|House & Garden]].'' She returned home for a year to turn around British ''Vogue'', and later assumed control of the franchise's magazine in New York, reviving what many saw as a stagnating publication. Her use of the magazine to shape the fashion industry has been the subject of debate within it. [[Animal rights]] activists have attacked her for promoting fur, while other critics have charged her with using the magazine to promote elitist views of femininity and beauty.

A former personal assistant, [[Lauren Weisberger]], wrote the 2003 bestselling ''[[roman <U+00E0> clef]]'' ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (novel)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'', later made into a successful [[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|film]] starring [[Meryl Streep]] as [[Miranda Priestly]], a fashion editor widely believed to be based on Wintour. In 2009 she was the focus of another film, [[R.J. Cutler]]'s documentary ''[[The September Issue]]''.

==Family==
Wintour was born in London in 1949 to [[Charles Wintour]] (1917<U+2013>1999), editor of the ''Evening Standard'', and Eleanor ("Nonie") Trego Baker, daughter of a Harvard law professor. The couple married in 1940 and divorced in 1979. Wintour was named after her maternal grandmother, Anna (Gilkyson) Baker, a merchant's daughter from Pennsylvania.<ref name="Oppenheimer2">Oppenheimer, 2.

==Early life==
The young Wintour was educated at the independent [[North London Collegiate School]], where she frequently rebelled against the [[Social aspects of clothing#Private dress codes|dress code]] by taking up the [[hemline]]s of her skirts.<ref name="Oppenheimer15">Oppenheimer, 15</ref> At the age of 14 she began wearing her hair in a [[bob cut|bob]].<ref name="Oppenheimer21">Oppenheimer, 21.</ref> She developed an interest in fashion as a regular viewer of [[Cathy McGowan]] on ''[[Ready Steady Go!]],''<ref name="Oppenheimer22">Oppenheimer, 22.</ref> and from the issues of ''[[Seventeen (magazine)|Seventeen]]'' her grandmother sent from America.<ref name="The September Issue 19:05">''The September Issue'', 0:19.</ref> "Growing up in [[Swinging London|London in the '60s]], you'd have to have had a sack over your head not to know something extraordinary was happening in fashion", she recalled.<ref name="September Issue 18:35">''The September Issue'', 0:18.</ref> Her father regularly consulted her when he was considering ideas for increasing readership in the youth market.<ref name="Oppenheimer22" />

===From fashion to journalism===
"I think my father really decided for me that I should work in fashion", she recalled in ''[[The September Issue]]''.<ref name="The September Issue 19:05"/> He arranged for his daughter's first job, at the influential [[Biba]] boutique, when she was 15.<ref name="Oppenheimer42-44">Oppenheimer, 42<U+2013>44.</ref> The next year, she left North London Collegiate and began a training program at [[Harrods]].

In 1970, when ''[[Harper's Bazaar|Harper's Bazaar UK]]'' merged with ''Queen'' to become ''Harper's & Queen'', Wintour was hired as one of its first editorial assistants, beginning her career in [[fashion journalism]].<ref name="Oppenheimer63">Oppenheimer, 63.</ref> She told her co-workers that she wanted to edit ''Vogue.''<ref name="Oppenheimer70">Oppenheimer, 70.</ref> While there, she discovered model Annabel Hodin, a former North London classmate.

===New York===
In her new home she became a junior fashion editor at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' in New York City in 1975.<ref name="Met bio" /> Wintour's innovative shoots led editor Tony Mazzola to fire her after nine months.<ref name="Oppenheimer109">Oppenheimer, 109.</ref> She was introduced to [[Bob Marley]] by one of Bradshaw's friends, and disappeared with him for a week.<ref name="Oppenheimer107">Oppenheimer, 107.</ref> A few months later, Bradshaw helped her get her first position as a fashion editor, at ''[[Viva (magazine)|Viva]]'', a women's adult magazine started by [[Kathy Keeton]], then wife of ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' publisher [[Bob Guccione]].

In late 1978, Guccione shut down the unprofitable magazine. Wintour decided to take some time off from work. She broke up with Bradshaw and began a relationship with French record producer [[Michel Esteban]], dividing her time with him between Paris and New York for two years.<ref name="Oppenheimer152">Oppenheimer, 152.</ref> She returned to work in 1980, succeeding [[Elsa Klensch]] as fashion editor for a new women's magazine named ''Savvy.''<ref name="Larson">Larson, Christina; April 2005; [http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2005/0504.larson2.html From Venus To Minerva]; ''[[Washington Monthly]]''.

The next year, she became fashion editor of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]].''<ref name="Met bio" /> There, the fashion spreads and photo shoots she had been putting together for years finally began attracting attention. Editor Edward Kosner sometimes bent very strict rules for her and let her work on other sections of the magazine. She learned through her work on a cover involving [[Rachel Ward]] how effectively celebrity covers sold copies.<ref name="Oppenheimer188">Oppenheimer, 188.</ref> "Anna saw the celebrity thing coming before everyone else did", Grace Coddington said three decades later.<ref name="September Issue 1:12:00">''The September Issue'', 1:12:00.</ref> A former colleague arranged for an interview with ''Vogue'' editor [[Grace Mirabella]] that ended when Wintour told Mirabella she wanted her job.<ref name="Kevin Gray profile 4">Gray, 4.</ref><ref name="Oppenheimer190">Oppenheimer, 190.</ref>

===Cond<U+00E9> Nast===
She went to work at ''Vogue'' later when Alex Liberman, editorial director for [[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications|Cond<U+00E9> Nast]], publisher of ''Vogue'', talked to Wintour about a position there in 1983. She eventually accepted after a bidding war that doubled her salary, becoming the magazine's first creative director, a position with vaguely defined responsibilities.<ref name="Oppenheimer207">Oppenheimer, 207.</ref> Her changes to the magazine were often made without Mirabella's knowledge, causing friction among the staff.<ref name="Oppenheimer208-10">Oppenheimer, 208-10.</ref> She began dating child psychiatrist [[David Shaffer]], an older acquaintance from London.<ref name="Oppenheimer193">Oppenheimer, 193.</ref> They married in 1984.<ref name="Oppenheimer223">Oppenheimer, 223.</ref>

A year later she attained her first editorship, taking over British ''Vogue'' after [[Beatrix Miller]] retired.<ref name="Oppenheimer230">Oppenheimer, 230.</ref> Once in charge, she replaced many staffers and exerted far more control over the magazine than any previous editor had, earning the nickname "Nuclear Wintour" in the process.<ref name="Oppenheimer243">Oppenheimer, 243.</ref> Those editors who were retained began to refer to the period as "The Wintour of Our Discontent."<ref name="Oppenheimer240">Oppenheimer, 240.</ref> Her changes moved the magazine from its traditional eccentricity to a direction more in line with the American magazine. Wintour's ideal reader was the same woman ''Savvy'' had tried to reach. "There's a new kind of woman out there", she told the ''Evening Standard.'' "She's interested in business and money. She doesn't have time to shop anymore. She wants to know what and why and where and how."<ref name="Larson" />

In 1987 Wintour returned to New York to take over ''[[House & Garden (magazine)|House & Garden]].'' Its circulation had long lagged rival ''[[Architectural Digest]],''<ref name="Oppenheimer269">Oppenheimer, 269.</ref> and Cond<U+00E9> Nast hoped she could improve it. Again she made radical changes to staff and look, canceling $2&nbsp;million worth of photo spreads and articles in her first week.<ref name="Time 1988">Zuckerman, Lawrence; June 13, 1988; [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967685-1,00.html The Dynamic Duo at Cond<U+00E9> Nast]; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. Retrieved February 8, 2007.</ref> She put so much fashion in photo spreads that it became known as ''House & Garment'', and enough celebrities that it was referred to as ''Vanity Chair'', within the industry.<ref name="Slate" />
[[File:November 1988 Vogue cover.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Wintour's first ''Vogue'' cover|alt=November 1988 cover of American Vogue magazine, showing model Michaela Bercu, shot from just below the waist in natural outdoor light, wearing a $10,000 jewel-encrusted Christian LaCroix T-shirt with faded 450 jeans. The top headline on the cover reads "The real cost of looking good"]]
Those changes worsened the magazine's problems. When the title was shortened to just ''HG'', many longtime subscribers thought they were getting a new magazine and put it aside for the real thing to arrive.<ref name="Oppenheimer269" /> Most of those subscriptions were eventually canceled, and while some fashion advertisers came over, most of the magazine's traditional advertisers pulled out.<ref name="Oppenheimer271">Oppenheimer, 271.</ref>

Ten months later she finally became editor of ''Vogue.'' Under Mirabella, it had become more focused on lifestyles as a whole and less on fashion.<ref name="Slate" /> Industry insiders worried that it was losing ground to the recently-introduced American edition of ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]''.<ref name="Larson" /><ref name="Slate" /> 

After making sweeping changes in staff, Wintour also changed the style of the cover pictures. Mirabella had preferred tight [[head shot]]s of well-known models in studios; Wintour's covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, like those [[Diana Vreeland]] had done years earlier.<ref name="Larson" /> She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive clothes with the high fashion<U+2014>the first issue she was in charge of, in November of that year, featured 19-year-old [[Michaela Bercu]] in a $50 pair of faded jeans and a bejeweled T-shirt by [[Christian Lacroix]] worth $10,000. It was the first time a Vogue cover model had worn jeans. "Wintour's approach hit a nerve<U+2014>this was the way real women put clothes together (with the likely exception of wearing multi-thousand-dollar T-shirts)", one reviewer says. On the June 1989 cover, another model was shown in wet hair, with just a bathrobe and no apparent makeup.<ref name="Slate" /> Photographers, makeup artists and hairstylists got credited along with the models.<ref name="Larson" />

===1990s===

Under her editorship, the magazine renewed its focus on fashion and returned to the prominence it had held under Vreeland. ''Vogue'' held its position as market leader against three contenders: ''Elle''; ''Harper's Bazaar'', which had lured away [[Liz Tilberis]], Wintour's most prominent deputy, and ''[[Mirabella]]'', a magazine [[Rupert Murdoch]] created for Wintour's fired predecessor. Her most serious competitor was within the company: [[Tina Brown]], editor of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' and later ''[[The New Yorker]]''.<ref name="Oppenheimer293-96">Oppenheimer, 293-96.</ref>

At the end of the decade, another of Wintour's inner circle left to run ''Harper's Bazaar''. [[Kate Betts]], seen as Wintour's likely successor, had broadened the magazine's reach by commissioning stories with a more hard-news edge, about women in politics, street culture and the financial difficulties of some major designers. She had also added the "Index" section, a few pages of tips meant to be torn out of the magazine. At staff meetings she earned Wintour's respect as the only person who publicly challenged her.<ref name="Kevin Gray profile 2">Gray, 2.</ref>

The two began to disagree about the magazine's direction. Betts felt ''Vogue''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s fashion coverage was getting too limited. Wintour in turn thought that the stories with [[popular culture]] angles Betts was assigning were beneath readers, and began pairing Betts with [[Plum Sykes]], whom Betts reportedly detested as a "pretentious airhead". Eventually she left, complaining to the ''New York Times'' that Wintour had not even sent her a baby gift. Wintour wrote an editor's letter that complimented Betts and wished her well.<ref name="Kevin Gray profile 3">Gray, 3.</ref>

===2000s===

Betts was one of several longtime editors to leave ''Vogue'' around the millennium. A year later, Sykes, another putative successor, left to concentrate on her bestselling novels set in the city's upper classes and a screenplay. A number of other editors also left to assume the top jobs at other publications. While some of their replacements didn't last, a new group of core editors formed.<ref name="NY Observer Plum Sykes story">{{cite news|last=Snyder|first=Gabriel|title=Bright Young Thing, Plum Sykes, Abandons Vogue, Sort Of|url=http://www.observer.com/node/43767|work=[[The New York Observer]]|date=December 17, 2000|accessdate=June 11, 2010}}</ref>

The September 2004 issue was 832 pages, the largest issue of a monthly magazine ever published at that time, since exceeded by the September 2007 issue Cutler's documentary covered.<ref name="Slate" /> She also oversaw the introduction of three spinoffs: ''[[Teen Vogue]]'', ''[[Vogue Living]]'' and ''[[Men's Vogue]].''

That year was generally difficult, as the [[Financial crisis of 2007<U+2013>2010|economy worsened]]. After ruffling feathers at Milan's shows in February, the April issue's cover image of [[LeBron James]] and [[Gisele B<U+00FC>ndchen]] brought criticism for its evocation of [[racial stereotypes]]. The next month a lavish [[Karl Lagerfeld]] gown she wore to the Met's Costume Institute Gala was called "the worst fashion ''[[faux pas]]'' of 2008." In the fall ''Vogue Living'' was suspended indefinitely, and ''Men's Vogue'' cut back to two issues a year as an [[outsert]] or supplement to the women's magazine. At the end of the year, December's cover highlighted a disparaging comment [[Jennifer Aniston]] made about [[Angelina Jolie]], to the former's displeasure. It seemed she had lost her touch.<ref name="NYPost 2009 story">{{cite news|last=Cardace|first=Sara|title= Will Fashion Queen Anna Wintour Lose Her Crown?|url=http://www.nypost.com/pagesixmag/issues/20090111/Will+Fashion+Queen+Anna+Wintour+Lose+Her+Crown|publisher=[[New York Post]]|work=[[Page Six]] Magazine|date=January 11, 2009|accessdate=June 14, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Men's Vogue folding">{{cite news|last=Mullaney|first=Tim|title=Cond<U+00E9> Nast to Fold Men's Vogue, Cut Back Portfolio|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=a3l1r3s.uPK0&refer=us|publisher=[[Bloomberg.com]]|date=October 30, 2008|accessdate=June 14, 2010|quote=Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications Inc. will fold Men's Vogue into the larger women's Vogue magazine ... because of faltering advertising sales.

In 2009, Wintour began making more media appearances. On a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' profile, she said she would not retire.

Wintour is also a philanthropist.

She claims to arise before 6 am, plays tennis and has her hair and makeup done, then gets to ''Vogue''{{'}}s offices two hours later. She always arrives at fashion shows well before their scheduled start. "I use the waiting time to make phone calls and notes; I get some of my best ideas at the shows", she says.<ref name="Bee" /> According to the [[BBC]] documentary series ''Boss Woman'', she rarely stays at parties for more than 20&nbsp;minutes at a time and gets to bed by 10:15 every night.<ref name="Boss Woman review">{{cite news|last=Money-Coutts|first=Sophia|title=Vogue documentary tries to get a read on the chilly Wintour|url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090803/ART/708029978/1209|publisher=[[Mubadala Development Company]]|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|date=August 2, 2009|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref> She exerts a great deal of control over the magazine's visual content.

===Personal fashion preferences===
Because of her position, Wintour's wardrobe is often closely scrutinized and imitated. Earlier in her career, she mixed fashionable T-shirts and vests with [[designer jeans]]. When she started at ''Vogue'' as creative director she switched to [[Chanel]] suits with miniskirts.<ref name="Oppenheimer207" /> She continued to wear them during both pregnancies,<ref name="Acid Queen" /> opening the skirts slightly in back and keeping her jacket on to cover up.<ref name="Oppenheimer229">Oppenheimer, 229.</ref>

Wintour reportedly said the film would probably go straight to [[DVD]].<ref name="Amiel" /> It made over US$300&nbsp;million in worldwide box office receipts. Later in 2006, in an interview with [[Barbara Walters]] that aired the day of the DVD's release, Wintour said she found the film "really entertaining" and praised it for making fashion "entertaining and glamorous and interesting ... I was 100 percent behind it."<ref name="Barbara Walters">{{cite news|last=Walter|first=Barbara|title=Anna Wintour: Always in Vogue|url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2716887&page=3|agency=[[ABC News]]|date=December 12, 2006|accessdate=December 18, 2006}}</ref>

That opinion of the movie has not yet led her to forgive Weisberger.<ref name="Oppenheimer328">Oppenheimer, 328.</ref> When it was reported that the novelist's editor told her to start her third novel over, Wintour's spokesman suggested she "should get a job as someone else's assistant."<ref name="Lloyd Grove">{{cite news|last=Grove|first=Lloyd|authorlink=Lloyd Grove|title=Author Goes From 'Prada' To Nada|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/2006/05/02/2006-05-02_author_goes_from__prada__to_.html|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=May 2, 2006|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}</ref>

Oppenheimer suggests ''The Devil Wears Prada'' may have done Wintour a favor by increasing her name recognition. "Besides giving Weisberger her [[15 minutes of fame|fifteen minutes]]", he says, "[it] ... place[d] Anna squarely in the mainstream celebrity pantheon. [She] was now known and talked about over Big Macs and french fries under the Golden Arches by young [[fashionista]]s in Wal-Mart denim in [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]] and [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]]."<ref name="Oppenheimer328" />

When ''The September Issue'' was released three years later, critics compared it with the earlier, fictional film. "For the past year or so, she's been on the media warpath to win back her image" said Paul Schrodt in ''[[Slant Magazine]]''.<ref name="Slant review">{{cite web|last=Schrodt|first=Paul|title=The September Issue|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/film_review.asp?ID=4472|date=August 27, 2009|accessdate=September 7, 2009}}</ref> Many considered the question of how similar she was to Streep's Priestly, and praised the film for showing the real person.

==Other criticism==

In 2005, two years after ''The Devil Wears Prada'', Oppenheimer's ''Front Row: The Cool Life and Hot Times of Vogue's Editor in Chief'' was published. It painted a similar portrait of the real woman. According to Oppenheimer, Wintour not only declined his requests for an interview but discouraged others from talking to him.<ref name="Oppenheimerxi">Oppenheimer, ''xi''</ref>

===Personality===
Wintour is often described as emotionally distant by those who have come to know her well, even her close friends. "At some stage in her career, Anna Wintour stopped being Anna Wintour and became 'Anna Wintour', at which point, like wings of a stately home, she closed off large sections of her personality to the public", wrote ''[[The Guardian]].''<ref name="What lies beneath" /> "I think she enjoys not being completely approachable. Just her office is very intimidating. You have to walk about a mile into the office before you get to her desk and I'm sure it's intentional", Coddington says.<ref name="60 Minutes 2" /> "I don't find her to be accessible to people she doesn't need to be accessible to", agrees ''Vogue'' publisher Tom Florio.<ref name="TSI 11:55">''The September Issue'', 0:11.</ref>

She has said she admired her father [[Charles Wintour|Charles]], known as "Chilly Charlie"<ref name="Kevin Gray profile 3" /><ref name="60 Minutes 3" /> for being "inscrutable".<ref name="Oppenheimer243" />  Former coworkers told Oppenheimer of a similar aloofness on her part. But she is also known for volatile outbursts of displeasure, and the widely-used "Nuclear Wintour" [[wikt:sobriquet|sobriquet]] is a result of both. She dislikes it enough to have asked ''The New York Times'' not to use it.<ref name="Oppenheimer243" /> "There are times I get quite angry", she admitted in ''The September Issue''.<ref name="TSI 1:11">''The September Issue'', 1:11.</ref>

"I think she has been very rude to a lot of people in the past, on her way up <U+2014> very terse", a friend told the ''Observer''. "She doesn't do small talk.

Once a junior editor saw her trip in the hallway, walked past without offering assistance, and was later told she "did ''absolutely'' the right thing."<ref name="Kevin Gray profile 2" />

Even friends admit to some trepidation in her presence. "Anna happens to be a friend of mine", says  [[Barbara Amiel]], "a fact which is of absolutely no help in coping with the cold panic that grips me whenever we meet."<ref name="Amiel" /> "I know when to stop pushing her", says Coddington. "She doesn't know when to stop pushing me".<ref name="TSI 32">''The September Issue'', 32:15.</ref>

Her attitude led [[Peter Braunstein]], the former ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'' media reporter later [[conviction|convicted]] of sexually assaulting a coworker, to plan her murder. After receiving only one ticket to the 2002 ''Vogue'' Fashion Awards, which he perceived as a snub, he became so angry that ''WWD'' fired him.<ref name="Braunstein NY Daily News">Ross, Barbara and Siemaszko, Corey; May 15, 2007; "[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2007/05/15/2007-05-15_fiend_dream_to_slay_the_style_queen-3.html Fiend dream to slay the style queen]"; ''[[New York Daily News]]''; retrieved May 15, 2007.</ref> At his 2007 trial, prosecutors introduced as evidence a journal he kept as a computer file in which he stated his intention to kill her.

On one occasion she has had to pay for her treatment of employees. In 2004, a court ruled that she and Shaffer were to pay $104,403, and Wintour herself an additional $32,639, to settle a lawsuit brought against them by the New York State [[Workers' Compensation]] Board. They had failed to pay the $140,000 it incurred on behalf of a former employee injured on the job who did not have the necessary insurance coverage.<ref name="TSG">Bastone, William; May 18, 2004; [http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0518043anna1.html Wintour In $140,000 Worker's Comp Default]; ''[[The Smoking Gun]]''.

In the 2000s, her relationship with Bryan was credited with softening her personality at work. "Even when she's in a bad mood, she has a different posture", someone described as a "Wintour watcher" told the ''[[New York Observer]]''. "The consensus is that she's so much more mellow and easier to work for because she's probably getting laid."<ref name="NY Observer Plum Sykes story" />

===Pro-fur stance===
She has often been the target of [[animal rights]] organizations like [[PETA]], who are angered by her use of fur in ''Vogue'', her pro-fur editorials and her refusal to run paid advertisements from animal rights organizations. Undeterred, she continues to use fur in photo spreads, saying there's always a way to wear it.<ref name="TSI 5:33">''The September Issue'', 0:05.</ref> "Nobody was wearing fur until she put it on the cover in the early 1990s", says [[Neiman Marcus Group]] CEO [[Burton Tansky]]. "She ignited the entire industry."<ref name="TSI 9:25">''The September Issue'', 0:09</ref>

===Elitism===
Another common criticism of Wintour's editorship focuses on ''Vogue''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s increasing use of celebrities on the cover, and her insistence on making them meet her standards.<ref name="Slate" /><ref name="Acid Queen" /><ref name="Celebrities on cover">Derrick, Robin; November 6, 2006; [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/in-vogue--for-90-years-423221.html In 'Vogue' for 90 Years]; ''[[The Independent]]''.

Retrieved March 2, 2007.</ref> She reportedly told [[Oprah Winfrey]] to lose weight before her cover photograph. Likewise, [[Hillary Clinton]] was told not to wear a blue suit.<ref name="Slate" /> At the 2005 Anglomania celebration, a ''Vogue''-sponsored salute to British fashion at the Met, Wintour is said to have personally chosen the clothes for prominent attendees such as [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Kate Moss]], [[Donald Trump]] and [[Diane von F<U+00FC>rstenberg]].<ref name="Acid Queen" /> "I don't think [[Diana Vreeland|Vreeland]] had that kind of concentration", says ''WWD'' publisher Patrick McCarthy. "She wouldn't have dressed [[Babe Paley]]. Nor would Babe Paley have let her." By persuading designers to loan clothes to prominent [[socialite]]s and celebrities, who are then photographed wearing the clothes not only in ''Vogue'' but more general-interest magazines like ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' and ''[[Us (magazine)|Us]]'', which in turn influence what buyers want, some in the industry believe Wintour is exerting too much control over it, especially since she is not involved in making or producing clothes herself. "The end result is that Anna can control it all the way to the selling floor", says Candy Pratts Price, executive fashion director at [[style.com]].<ref name="Citizen Anna 2" /> She has been credited with killing [[Grunge#Presentation and fashion|grunge fashion]] in the early 1990s, when it wasn't selling well, by telling designers that if they continued to avoid glamour their looks would not be photographed for ''Vogue''. All complied.<ref name="Kevin Gray profile 4" />
[[File:Anna Wintour 2.jpg|thumb|225px|left|Wintour (photographed by Ed Kavishe of [http://www.fashionwirepress.com Fashion Wire Press]<!-- inline credit is required under the release for this image -->) often insists on being seated apart from other fashion editors at shows.|alt=A seated woman wearing a white dress, holding a coffee cup and sunglasses, looking at the camera. The surrounding seats are empty.]]
Another ''Vogue'' writer has complained that Wintour excluded ordinary working women, many of whom are regular subscribers, from the pages. "She's obsessed only about reflecting the aspirations of a certain class of reader", she says. "We once had a piece about [[breast cancer]] which started with an [[flight attendant|airline stewardess]], but she wouldn't have a stewardess in the magazine so we had to go and look for a high-flying businesswoman who'd had cancer."<ref name="Slate" />

Wintour has been accused of setting herself apart even from peers. "I do not think fiction could surpass the reality", a British fashion magazine editor says of ''The Devil Wears Prada.'' "[A]rt in this instance is only a poor imitation of life." Wintour, the editor says, routinely requests to be seated out of sight of competing editors at shows. "We spend our working lives telling people which it-bag to carry but Anna is so above the rest of us she does not even have a handbag."<ref name="Acid Queen" />

Her successful request that key shows at the 2008 Milan Fashion Week be rescheduled for earlier in the week so that she and other U.S.-based editors could have time to return home before the Paris shows led to complaints. Other editors said they had to rush through the earlier shows, and lesser-known designers who had to show later were denied an important audience. [[Dolce & Gabbana]] said that Italian fashion was getting short shrift and that Milan was becoming a "circus without sense."<ref name="Italian fashion complaints">Moore, Malcolm; February 22, 2008; "[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/labels/dolcegabbana/3364542/Dolce-and-Gabbana-slams-Milan-Fashion-Week.html Dolce & Gabbana slams Milan Fashion Week]"; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.

[[Giorgio Armani]], who at the time was co-chairing a Met exhibition on [[superhero]]es' costumes with Wintour, drew some attention for his cutting personal remarks. "Maybe what she thinks is a beautiful dress, I wouldn't think was a beautiful dress", he said. While he claimed he couldn't understand why people disliked her, saying he himself was indifferent, he expressed hope that she hadn't made a comment once attributed to her that "the Armani era is over." He accused her of preferring [[French fashion|French]] and American fashion over Italian.<ref name="Armani comments">Peck, Sally; February 21, 2008; "[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1579440/Giorgio-Armani-attacks-Vogues-Anna-Wintour.html Giorgio Armani attacks Vogue's Anna Wintour]"; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.

Her remarks about [[obesity]] have caused controversy on more than one occasion. In 2005, Wintour was heavily criticized by the New York chapter of the [[National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance]] after ''Vogue'' editor-at-large [[Andr<U+00E9> Leon Talley]] said on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' that, at one point, Wintour demanded he lose weight. "Most of the ''Vogue'' girls are so thin, tremendously thin" he said, "because Miss Anna don't like fat people."<ref>Pittsburgh Tribune-Review; September 19, 2005; "[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_375745.html Vogue fat comment raises group's ire]"; United Press International.

===Responses===
Defenses of Wintour have often come from others. Amanda Fortini at ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' said she was comfortable with Wintour's elitism since that was intrinsic to fashion:
{{quote|Most of us read ''Vogue'' not with the intention of buying the wildly expensive clothes, but because doing so educates our eye and hones our taste, similar to the way eating gourmet food refines the [[palate]]. This is a pleasure enabled by Wintour's ruthless aesthetic, her refusal to participate in the democratizing tendency of most of her competitors. To deny her that privilege is to deny her readers the privilege of fantasy in the form of beautifully photographed Paris couture.<ref name="Slate" />}}
[[Emma Brockes]] sees this in Wintour herself: "[Her] unwavering ability to look as if she lives within the pages of her magazine has a sort of honesty to it, proof that, whatever one thinks about it, the lifestyle peddled by Vogue is at least physically possible."<ref name="What lies beneath"/>

Some friends see her purported coldness as just traditional British reserve,<ref name="Amiel Maclean's" /> or shyness.<ref name="Kevin Gray profile 2" /> Brockes says it may be mutual, "partly a reflection of how awkward people are with her, particularly women, who get preemptively chippy when faced with the prospect of meeting Fashion Incarnate."<ref name="What lies beneath">[[Emma Brockes|Brockes, Emma]]; May 27, 2006; "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/may/27/pressandpublishing.fashion What lies beneath]"; ''[[The Guardian]]''.

{{quote|I have so many people here, Morley, that have worked with me for 15, 20 years, and, you know, if I'm such a bitch, they must really be a glutton for punishment because they're still here ...  If one comes across sometimes as being cold or brusque, it's simply because I'm striving for the best<ref name="60 Minutes 2" />}}
She has made similar statements in defense of her reported refusal to hire fat people. "It's important to me that the people that are working here, particularly in the fashion department", she says, "will present themselves in a way that makes sense to the outside world that they work at ''Vogue''"<ref name="Kevin Gray profile 2" />

Her defenders have called criticism [[sexism|sexist]]. "Powerful women in the media always get inspected more thoroughly than their male counterparts", said ''The New York Times'' in a piece about Wintour shortly after ''The Devil Wears Prada''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release.<ref name="Times Wintour film piece">Carr, David; July 10, 2006; "[http://plainsfeminist.blogspot.com/2006/07/devil-you-say.html The Devil Wears Teflon]"; ''The New York Times'', retrieved from plainsfeminist.blogspot.com December 10, 2006.</ref> When she took over at ''Vogue'', gossip columnist [[Liz Smith (journalist)|Liz Smith]] reported rumors that she had gotten the job through an affair with [[Samuel Irving Newhouse, Jr.|Si Newhouse]]. A reportedly furious Wintour made her anger the subject of one of her first staff meetings.<ref name="Larson" /> She still complained about it when accepting a media award in 2002.<ref name="Oppenheimer286">Oppenheimer, 286.</ref>

She has been called a [[feminism|feminist]] whose changes to ''Vogue'' have reflected, acknowledged and reinforced advances in the status of women. Reviewing Oppenheimer's book in ''[[The Washington Monthly]]'', [[managing editor]] Christina Larson notes that ''Vogue'', unlike many other women's magazines,{{quote|...doesn't play to its readership's sense of inadequacy ... Instead, it reminds women to take satisfaction, parading all manner of fineries (clothes, furniture, travel destinations) that a successful woman might buy, or at least admire. While it surely exists to sell ads ... it does so primarily by exploiting ambition, not insecurity.<ref name="Larson" />}}
Wintour, unlike Vreeland, "...shifted ''Vogue'''s focus from the cult of beauty to the cult of the creation of beauty".<ref name="Larson" /> To her, the focus on celebrities is a welcome development as it means that women are making the cover of ''Vogue'' at least in part for what they have accomplished, not just how they look.<ref name="Larson" />

Complaints about her role as fashion ''[[eminence grise]]'' are dismissed by those familiar with how she actually exercises it. "She's honest. She tells you what she thinks. Yes is yes and no is no", according to [[Karl Lagerfeld]]. "She's not too pushy" agrees [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Henri Pinault]], [[chief executive officer]] of [[PPR (company)|PPR]], [[Gucci]]'s parent company. "She lets you know it's not a problem if you can't do something she wants." Defenders also point out that she continued supporting Gucci despite her strong belief PPR should not have let [[Tom Ford]] go. Designers such as [[Alice Roi]] and [[Isabel Toledo]] have flourished without indulging Wintour or ''Vogue.''<ref name="Citizen Anna 2" /> Her willingness to throw her weight around has helped keep ''Vogue'' independent despite its heavy reliance on advertising dollars. Wintour was the only fashion editor who refused to follow an [[Giorgio Armani S.p.A.|Armani]] ultimatum to feature more of its clothes in the magazine's editorial pages,<ref name="Acid Queen" /> although she has also admitted that if she has to choose between two dresses, one by an advertiser and the other not, she will choose the former every time. "Commercial is not a dirty word to me".<ref name="Kevin Gray profile 4" />

In response to criticisms like Beene's, she has defended the democratization of what were once exclusive luxury brands. "It means more people are going to get better fashion", she told [[Dana Thomas]]. "And the more people who can have fashion, the better".<ref name="Dana Thomas book">{{cite book |title=[[Deluxe: How Luxury Lost Its Luster]] |last=Thomas |first=Dana |authorlink=Dana Thomas |year=2007 |publisher=[[Penguin Group|The Penguin Press]] |location=New York |isbn=9781594201295 |page=322}}</ref>
