The '''Blue-winged Leafbird''', '' Chloropsis cochinchinensis'' also known as '''[[Thomas C. Jerdon|Jerdon]]'s Leafbird''', is a [[leafbird]]. Leafbirds are a family of [[bulbul]]-like small [[passerine]] [[bird]] [[species]] found in [[India]] and southeast [[Asia]]. They were formerly grouped with the [[iora]]s in the family Irenidae.

The Blue-winged Leafbird is a common resident breeder in southern [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], southeast [[Asia]] and [[Indonesia]]. Its habitat is forest and more open woodland, where it builds its nest in a tree, laying 2-3 eggs. This species eats insects, fruit and nectar.

They were earlier classified along with the bulbuls, but unlike the bulbuls, the sexes differ. The male is green-bodied with a yellow head, black face and throat. It has a blue moustachial line, wing patch and tail sides. The female differs in that it has a green head and blue throat, and young birds are like the female but without the blue throat patch.

The Sri Lankan race, '' C. c. jerdoni'', lacks the blue in the wings and tail. The females and young of this form have a yellow border to the blue throat patch.

The similar [[Golden-fronted Leafbird]] lacks blue in the flight feathers and tail, and has a golden forehead.

The call of this Leafbird like other Leafbirds consists of a rich mixture of imitations of the calls of various other species of bird.
