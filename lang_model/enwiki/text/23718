'''Marion Gordon "Pat" Robertson''' (born [[March 22]] [[1930]])<ref name="officialbio">{{cite web |url=http://www.patrobertson.com/Biography/index.asp |title=Official biography |accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref> is a [[televangelist]] from the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4805952.stm |title="Top US evangelist targets Islam" |date=[[2007-03-14]] |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref> He is the founder of numerous organizations and corporations, including the [[American Center for Law and Justice]] (ACLJ), [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] (CBN), the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]], Flying Hospital, International Family Entertainment, [[Operation Blessing International|Operation Blessing International Relief and Development Corporation]], and [[Regent University]].<ref name="officialbio" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.org/about.cfm |title="About Us" |publisher=[[Christian Coalition]] |accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref> He is the host of ''[[The 700 Club]],'' a Christian TV program airing on channels throughout the United States and on CBN affiliates worldwide.<ref name="officialbio" />

Robertson is a [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] and was active as an ordained minister with that denomination for many years, but holds to a [[charismatic movement|charismatic]] theology not traditionally common among Southern Baptists. He unsuccessfully campaigned to become the [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican Party]]'s nominee in the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mediamatters.org/issues_topics/people/patrobertson |title="Pat Robertson" |publisher=[[Media Matters for America]] |accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref> As a result of his seeking political office, he no longer serves in an official role for any church. His media and financial resources make him a recognized, influential, and controversial public voice for [[conservative Christianity]] in the United States.

==Life and career==
===Family===
Robertson was born in [[Lexington, Virginia]], into a prominent political family. His parents were [[Absalom Willis Robertson]], a conservative [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]], and his wife Gladys Churchill ([[n<U+00E9>e]] Willis). He married Adelia "Dede" Elmer in 1954. His family includes four children, among them [[Gordon P. Robertson]], and at the time of writing (mid-2005) fourteen grandchildren.

At a young age, Robertson was given the nickname of ''Pat'' by his six-year-old brother, Willis Robertson, Jr., who enjoyed patting him on the cheeks when he was a baby while saying "''pat, pat, pat''". As he got older, Robertson thought about which first name he would like people to use. He considered "Marion" to be effeminate, and "M. Gordon" to be affected, so he opted for his childhood nickname "Pat". His strong awareness for the importance of names in the creation of a public image showed itself again during his presidential run when he threatened to sue NBC news for calling him a "television evangelist", which later became "televangelist", at a time when [[Jimmy Swaggart]] and [[Jim Bakker]] were objects of scandal. He insisted upon being called a "religious broadcaster".

===Education and military service===
When he was eleven, Robertson was enrolled in the military preparatory [[McDonogh School]] outside [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. From 1940 until 1946 he attended [[The McCallie School]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. He graduated with honors and enrolled at [[Washington and Lee University]], where he majored in history. The claim that he was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]], a prestigious national honor society, is not substantiated by the Phi Beta Kappa membership directory.<ref>Phi Beta Kappa Membership Directory, Vol 1. 2000.</ref> He also joined [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity. Robertson has said, "Although I worked hard at my studies, my real major centered around lovely young ladies who attended the nearby girls schools."<ref>[http://www.patrobertson.com/education/ "Education"], The Official Site of Pat Robertson.</ref> 

In 1948, the [[Conscription|draft]] was reinstated and Robertson was given the option of joining the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] or being drafted into the army. He opted for the former, which allowed him to finish college under the condition that he attend [[Officer Candidates School (U.S. Marine Corps)|Officer Candidates School]] (OCS) in [[Marine Corps Base Quantico|Quantico]], [[Virginia]] during the summer. He graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree and was the first person to be [[Commissioned officer|commissioned]] as a [[Second Lieutenant]] at a graduation ceremony at Washington and Lee. In January 1951, Robertson served four months in Japan, "doing rehabilitation training for Marines wounded in [[Korea]]". 

In his words, "We did long, grueling marches to toughen the men, plus refresher training in firearms and bayonet combat." In the same year, he transferred to Korea, "I ended up at the headquarters command of the First Marine Division," says Robertson. "The Division was in combat in the hot and dusty, then bitterly cold portion of North Korea just above the 38th Parallel later identified as the 'Punchbowl' and 'Heartbreak Ridge.' For that service in the Korean War, the Marine Corps awarded me three battle stars for 'action against the enemy.'"<ref>[http://www.patrobertson.com/militaryservice/ "Military Service"], The Official Site of Pat Robertson.</ref>

However, former Republican Congressman [[Pete McCloskey|Paul "Pete" McCloskey, Jr.]], who served with Robertson in Korea, claimed that Robertson was actually spared combat duty when his powerful father, a U.S. Senator, intervened on his behalf, claiming that instead Robertson spent most of his time in an office in [[Japan]]. According to McCloskey, his time in the service was not in combat but as the "liquor officer" responsible for keeping the [[officers' clubs]] supplied with liquor. 

Robertson was promoted to First Lieutenant in 1952 upon his return to the United States. He then went on to receive a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree from [[Yale University Law School]] in 1955. However, he failed to pass the bar exam,<ref>[http://www.patrobertson.com/SpiritualJourney/SomethingMissing.asp "Spiritual Journey"], The Official Site of Pat Robertson.</ref> shortly thereafter underwent his religious conversion, and decided against pursuing a career in law. Instead, Robertson attended the [[New York Theological Seminary]], and was awarded a [[Master of Divinity]] degree in [[1959]].

===Religious career===
In 1956 Robertson found his faith through [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[missionary]] [[Cornelius Vanderbreggen]], who impressed Robertson both by his lifestyle and his message. Vanderbreggen quoted [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] (3:5, 6), "''Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths''", which Robertson considers to be the "''guiding principle''" of his life. Soon afterwards, he was ''filled with the [[Holy Spirit]]'' and [[Glossolalia|''spoke in tongues'']]{{Fact|date=August 2007}} for the first time. He was ordained as a minister of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] in 1961.

In 1960, Robertson established the [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]. He started it by buying a small UHF station in nearby [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]]. Later in 1977 he purchased a local-access cable channel in the Hampton Roads area and called it CBN. Originally he went door-to-door in Virginia Beach, Hampton Roads, and other surrounding areas asking Christians to buy cable boxes so that they could receive his new channel. He also canvassed local churches in the Virginia Beach area to do the same, and solicited donations through public speaking engagements at local churches and on CBN. One of his friends, the pastor of Rock Church Virginia Beach- John Giminez was influential in helping Robertson establish CBN with donations, as well as offering the services of volunteers from his church.

CBN is now seen in 180 countries and broadcast in 71 languages. he founded the CBN Cable Network, which was renamed the CBN Family Channel in 1988 and later simply the Family Channel. When the Family Channel became too profitable for Robertson to keep it under the CBN umbrella without endangering CBN's nonprofit status, he formed [[International Family Entertainment Inc.]] in 1990 with the Family Channel as its main subsidiary. Robertson sold the Family Channel to the [[News Corporation]] in 1997, which renamed it Fox Family. A condition of the sale was that the station would continue airing Robertson's television program, ''The [[700 Club]]'', twice a day in perpetuity, regardless of any changes of ownership. The channel is now owned by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] and run as "[[ABC Family]]". On [[December 3]], [[2007]], Robertson resigned as chief executive of CBN; he was succeeded by his son, Gordon.<ref>[http://www.splc.org/newsflash.asp?id=1655&year Student Press Law Center - News Flashes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Robertson founded CBN University in 1977 on CBN's Virginia Beach campus. It was renamed [[Regent University]] in 1989. Robertson serves as its [[chancellor]]. He is also founder and president of the [[American Center for Law and Justice]], a public interest law firm that defends Christians whose [[First Amendment]] rights have allegedly been violated. The law firm, headquartered in the same building that houses Regent's [[law school]], focuses on "[[pro-family]], pro-liberty and [[pro-life]]" cases nationwide.

===1988 presidential bid===
In September, 1986, Robertson announced his intention to seek the [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] nomination for [[President of the United States]]. Robertson said he would pursue the nomination only if three million people signed up to volunteer for his campaign by September, 1987. Three million responded, and by the time Robertson announced he'd be running in September 1987, he also had raised millions of dollars for his campaign fund. He surrendered his ministerial credentials and turned leadership of CBN over to his son, Tim. His campaign, however, against incumbent [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[George H. W. Bush]], was seen as a long shot. 

Robertson ran on a very [[American conservatism|conservative]] platform. Among his policies, he wanted to ban [[pornography]], reform the education system,<!--eliminate [[Conrail]] and [[Amtrak]], and --> and eliminate departments such as the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]. He also supported a [[Amendments to the Constitution of the United States|constitutional amendment]] requiring a [[Balanced Budget Amendment|balanced federal budget]].

During the start of the presidential [[primary election]] season in early 1988, Robertson's campaign was attacked because of a statement he had made about his military service. In his campaign literature, he stated he was a combat Marine who served in the [[Korean War]]. Other Marines in his battalion contradicted Robertson's version, claiming he had never spent a day in a combat environment. They asserted that instead of fighting in the war, Robertson's primary responsibility was supplying alcoholic beverages for his officers. (see Education and military service)

Robertson's campaign got off to a strong second-place finish in the [[Iowa caucus]], ahead of Bush.<ref>[http://iowapresidentialpolitics.com/caucus_info/bergenaswinebrenner.html "About the caucuses: Meaningful test"], Johan Bergenas, Iowa Presidential Politics.com.</ref>

Robertson did poorly in the subsequent [[New Hampshire primary]], however, and was unable to be competitive once the multiple-state primaries began. Robertson ended his campaign before the primaries were finished. His best finish was in [[Washington]], winning the majority of caucus delegates. However, his controversial win has been credited to procedural manipulation by Robertson supporters who delayed final voting until late into the evening when other supporters had gone home.<ref>[http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/story/273555.html "Primary versus caucus fight rolls on among state politicians"], Niki Sullivan, Tacoma News Tribune.</ref><ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2D81539F93AA35750C0A96E948260 " Bush routs Dole in primaries"], Michale Oreskes, New York Times.</ref> He later spoke at the [[1988 Republican National Convention]] in [[New Orleans]] and told his remaining supporters to cast their votes for Bush, who ended up winning the nomination and the election. He then returned to CBN and has remained there as a religious broadcaster.

===Books===
[[Image:NWO Pat Rob.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[The New World Order (Robertson)|The New World Order]]]]

Robertson's books have been both successful and controversial. ''[[The Secret Kingdom]],'' ''[[Answers to 100 of Life's Most Probing Questions]],'' and ''[[The New World Order (Robertson)|The New World Order]]'' were each in their respective year of publication the number one religious book in America. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Robertson's tome ''The New World Order'' was described as a 'catch all for conspiracy theories' by Christian academic Don Wilkey:  

<blockquote>Pat Robertson<U+2019>s work, NEW WORLD ORDER, is a catch all for conspiracy theories. It combines the paranoia of the Old Right with modern versions. A summary of Robertson<U+2019>s book is found on page 177 in which Pat says a conspiracy has existed in the world working through Freemasonry and a secret Order of the Illuminati, a group combining [[Freemasons|Masons]] and Jewish Bankers.<ref>Don Wilkey, [http://www.livingston.net/wilkyjr/link26.htm book review of ''New World Order''], "A Christian Looks At the Religious Right". Accessed 11 December 2006.</ref></blockquote>

Ephraim Radner also accuses Robertson of espousing anti-semitic beliefs in the same book:

<blockquote>In his published writings, especially his 1991 book The New World Order, Pat Robertson has propagated theories about a worldwide Jewish conspiracy. Michael Land raised the issue in February in the New York Times Book Review, and in April Jacob Heilbrun, writing in the New York Review of Books, cited chapter and verse of Robertson's borrowings from well-known anti-Semitic works.<ref>Ephraim Radner, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1058/is_n26_v112/ai_17497869 New world order, old world anti-Semitism <U+2014> Pat Robertson of the Christian Coalition], ''Christian Century'', [[September 13]], [[1995]]. Accessed 11 December 2006.</ref></blockquote>

===Business interests===
He is the founder and chairman of [[Christian Broadcasting Network|The Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) Inc.]], and founder of [[International Family Entertainment Inc.]], Regent University, Operation Blessing International Relief and Development Corporation, American Center for Law and Justice, The Flying Hospital, Inc. and several other organizations and broadcast entities. Robertson was the founder and co-chairman of [[International Family Entertainment Inc.]] (IFE). 

Formed in 1990, IFE produced and distributed family entertainment and information programming worldwide. IFE's principal business was The Family Channel, a satellite delivered cable-television network with 63 million U.S. subscribers. IFE, a publicly held company listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], was sold in [[1997]] to [[Fox Kids Worldwide, Inc.]] for $1.9 billion, whereupon it was renamed [[Fox Family Channel]]. [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] acquired FFC in 2001 and its name was changed again, to [[ABC Family]].

Robertson is a global businessman with media holdings in Asia, the United Kingdom, and Africa. He is the nation's number three cable operator, behind [[Ted Turner]] and [[Home Box Office|HBO]] {{Verify source|date=June 2007}}. He struck a deal with Pittsburgh, PA-based [[General Nutrition Center]] to produce and market a weight-loss shake he created and promoted on the 700 Club TV show.

In 1999, Robertson entered into a joint venture with the [[Bank of Scotland]] to provide financial services in the United States. However, the move was met with criticism in the UK due to Robertson's views on homosexuality. After Robertson commented that Scotland was "a dark land overrun by homosexuals", the Bank of Scotland canceled the venture.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/361736.stm BBC News | The Company File | Bank drops evangelist<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Robertson's extensive business interests have earned him a net worth estimated between $200 million and $1 billion.<ref>[http://www.sullivan-county.com/news/pat_quotes/palst.htm Palast investigates Pat Robertson<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Political activism==
After his unsuccessful presidential campaign, Robertson started the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]], a 1.7 million member [[Christian right]] organization that campaigned mostly for conservative candidates. It became, almost instantly, one of the most influential organizations in American politics and one of the largest and most powerful lobbying groups in the United States.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} However, the organization's popularity has faded somewhat.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} It was sued by the [[Federal Election Commission]] "for coordinating its activities with Republican candidates for office in 1990, 1992 and 1994 and failing to report its expenditures"<ref>[http://www.au.org/site/News2?JServSessionIdr005=ao8o141u41.app7b&abbr=pr&page=NewsArticle&id=6105&news_iv_ctrl=1523 "In Closed-Door Session with Christian Coalition State Leaders, Pat Robertson Unveils Plan to Control GOP Presidential Nomination"], September 18 1997, Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</ref>

In 1994, the Coalition was fined for "improperly [aiding] then Representative Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and [[Oliver North]], who was then the Republican Senate nominee in Virginia."<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1058/is_22_116/ai_55670890 "Christian Coalition wins on voter guides <U+2014> allowed to distribute guides, but can not support candidates"], Rns, ''Christian Century'', August 11 1999.</ref> Robertson left the Coalition in 2001.

While Robertson is primarily popular among evangelical Christians, his support extends beyond the Christian community. In 2002, he received the ''State of [[Israel]] Friendship Award'' from the [[Zionist Organization of America]] for his consistent support for a [[Greater Israel]]. In that year the [[Coalition for Jewish Concerns]] also expressed its gratitude to Robertson for "unwavering support for Israel" and "standing up to evil".

Robertson has also been a governing member of the [[Council for National Policy]] (CNP). Seekgod.ca, which describes itself as "an independent Christian research and apologetics ministry"<ref>[http://www.seekgod.ca Seekgod.ca homepage]</ref>  listed him on the CNP Board of Governors 1982, President Executive Committee 1985<U+2013>86, member, 1984, 1988, 1998.<ref>[http://www.seekgod.ca/cnp.r.htm Research > The Council for National Policy (CNP)] on Seekgod.ca.

Simon, Esq., [http://www.publiceye.org/ifas/fw/9611/cnp.html CNP's radical agenda], Institute for First Amendment Studies, Inc., which makes several mentions of Robertson's role in CNP</ref>

On November 7, 2007, Robertson announced that he was endorsing [[Rudy Giuliani]] to be the Republican nominee in the 2008 Presidential election.<ref>[http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8SOUT000&show_article=1&lst=1 Pat Robertson Backs Giuliani's Bid<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Controversies and criticisms==
{{main|Pat Robertson controversies}}
Robertson is outspoken in both his faith and his politics and controversies surrounding him have often made headlines.

==Predictions==
Several times near [[New Year]] Robertson has announced that God told him several truths or events that would happen in the following year. <U+201C>I have a relatively good track record,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>Sometimes I miss.<U+201D><ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16442877/ Pat Robertson warns of terrorist attack in <U+2019>07 - Life - MSNBC.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===2008: worldwide violence and American recession===
On the [[January 2]], [[2008]] episode of ''The 700 Club'', Pat Robertson predicted that 2008 would be a year of worldwide violence. He also predicted that a recession would occur in the United States that would be followed by a stock-market crash by [[2010]].<ref name = "FoxNews-Predicts">[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,319728,00.html Pat Robertson Predicts Worldwide Violence, U.S. Recession in 2008]</ref>

===2007: terror attack===
On the [[January 2]], [[2007]] broadcast of ''The 700 Club'', Robertson said that [[God]] spoke to him and told him that "mass killings" were to come during 2007, due to a terrorist attack on the United States.  He added "The Lord didn't say [[nuclear terrorism|nuclear]]. But I do believe it will be something like that."<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16442877/ "Pat Robertson warns of terrorist attack in 2007"], January 2 2007, MSNBC.com.</ref> No terrorist attacks against the United States in general, or its interests, ever occurred in 2007. When a terrorist attack failed to happen, Robertson responded by saying, <U+201C>All I can think is that somehow the people of God prayed and God in his mercy spared us.<U+201D><ref name = "FoxNews-Predicts"/>

===2006: Pacific Northwestern tsunami===
In May 2006, Robertson declared that storms and possibly a [[tsunami]] would hit America's coastline sometime in 2006. Robertson supposedly received this revelation from God during an annual personal prayer retreat in January. The claim was repeated four times on ''The 700 Club''. 

On [[May 8]] [[2006]] Robertson said, "If I heard the Lord right about 2006, the coasts of America will be lashed by storms." On [[May 17]] [[2006]] he elaborated, "There well may be something as bad as a tsunami in the [[Pacific Northwest]]."<ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003004452_pat19.html "God is warning of big storms, Robertson says"], May 19, 2006, The Associated Press.</ref> While this claim didn't garner the same level of controversy as some of his other statements, it was generally received with mild amusement by the Pacific Northwest media. It should also be noted that the [[History Channel]]'s initial airing of its new series, ''Mega Disasters: West Coast Tsunami'', was broadcast the first week of May.

It is worth noting that, while a tsunami obviously did not affect the United States, no hurricanes reached United States soil that year, and the [[2006 Atlantic hurricane season|2006 Hurricane Season]] was actually far tamer than the extremely active and dangerous [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005 Hurricane Season]].

===1982: Doomsday===
In late 1976, Robertson predicted that the end of the world was coming in November or October of 1982. In a May 1980 broadcast of ''The 700 Club'' he stated "I guarantee you by the end of 1982 there is going to be a judgment on the world."<ref>[http://www.abhota.info/end3.htm "Doomsday: 1971 - 1997"]</ref>
