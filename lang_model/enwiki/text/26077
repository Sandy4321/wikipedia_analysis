'''SS ''El Oriente''''' was a cargo ship built in 1910 for the [[Morgan Line]], a subsidiary of the [[Southern Pacific Company]]. During [[World War I]], she was known as '''USS ''El Oriente'' (ID-4504)''' in service with the [[United States Navy]]. At the end of war, she reverted to her original name of SS ''El Oriente''. During [[World War II]] she was [[ship chartering|chartered]] by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) as '''SS ''Henri Dunant''''' (sometimes also spelled '''''Henry Dunant'''''), but reverted to her original name of SS ''El Oriente'' at the end of the charter.

SS ''El Oriente'' was one of four sister ships that carried cargo and a limited number of passengers for the Morgan Line. She was acquired by the U.S. Navy in July 1918, and converted to carry horses and mules to France, and after the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]], was converted again to carry American troops home from Europe.

''El Oriente'' returned to the Morgan Line in 1919 and sailed with them until June 1941, when the entire Morgan Line fleet was purchased by the [[United States Maritime Commission]]. ''El Oriente'' served as a civilian-crewed cargo ship during [[World War II]], sailing primarily between the United States and the United Kingdom. In September 1944, she was chartered by the ICRC and sailed under the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] flag carrying food parcels to American [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] held in [[Germany|German]] camps. ''Henri Dunant'' continued to sail under Swiss charter until October 1945, when she was returned to the United States and reverted to her former name. ''El Oriente'' was placed in the [[James River Reserve Fleet]] in November 1945, and was sold for scrapping in July 1946.

== Early career ==
SS ''El Oriente'' was a cargo and passenger steamship [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 11 May 1910 by the [[Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co.]] of [[Newport News, Virginia]] (yard no. 132), and delivered to the Atlantic division of the Morgan Line on 24 October 1910. She was the third of four sister ships; the other three being {{SS|El Sol||2}}, ''El Mundo'', and {{SS|El Occidente||2}}.<ref name=NYT-el_oriente>{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9B0CEFDB1E39E333A25754C0A96E9C946196D6CF | format = pdf | title = El Oriente launched | work = The New York Times | date = 7 August 1910 | page = 3 }}</ref><ref name=Colton>{{cite web | last = Colton | first = Tim | url = http://www.shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/1major/active/newportnews.htm | title = Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., Newport News VA | date =  | publisher = Colton Company | accessdate = 2008-08-07 }}</ref> ''El Oriente'' was {{GRT|6,008|first=yes}},<ref name=Colton /> was {{convert|430|ft|2|in|m}} long by {{convert|53|ft|1|in|m}} [[beam (nautical)|abeam]], and made {{convert|16|knots|km/h}}.<ref name=DANFS>{{cite DANFS | author = [[Naval Historical Center]] | title = El Oriente | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/e2/el_oriente.htm | short = on }}</ref> The vessel sailed for the [[Morgan Line]], the brand name of the Southern Pacific Steamship Company (a subsidiary of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]), which employed her to carry cargo and a limited number of passengers between [[New York City|New York]]; [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], the eastern terminus of the Southern Pacific line; and [[Galveston, Texas]].<ref name=NYT-el_oriente />

== World War I ==
After the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, it's unclear what role, if any, ''El Oriente'' played early on in the war. Her sister ships {{USAT|El Occidente||2}} and {{USAT|El Sol||2}} were both requisitioned by the [[United States Shipping Board]] (USSB) on behalf of the [[United States Army]],<ref name=DANFS-sisters>See: {{cite DANFS | author = Naval Historical Center | title = El Occidente | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/e2/el_occidente.htm | short = on }} Also: {{cite DANFS | author = Naval Historical Center | title = El Sol | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/e2/el_sol.htm | short = on }}</ref> and both were designated as animal transport ships.<ref name=NNVet>Krenzelok</ref> If ''El Oriente'' were used by the Army as an animal transport ship, she would have needed a refit which typically meant that any second- or third-class passenger accommodations had to be ripped out and replaced with ramps and stalls for the horses and mules carried.<ref>Crowell and Wilson, pp. 313<U+2013>14.</ref> It is known that ''El Oriente'' sailed in an American convoy to France on 16 April 1918 with U.S. Navy transports {{USS|Maui|ID-1514|2}}, {{USS|Calamares|ID-3662|2}}, {{USS|Pocahontas|ID-3044|2}}, and {{USS|Madawaska|ID-3011|2}}, British transports [[HMT Czar|''Czar'']] and [[HMT Czaritza|''Czaritza'']], and U.S. cruiser {{USS|Seattle|CA-11|2}}, and reached France on 28 April.<ref>Crowell and Wilson, p. 607.</ref><ref group=Note>The convoy was joined by {{USS|Mount Vernon|ID-4508|2}}, which had sailed from [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], on 19 April. See: Crowell and Wilson, p. 607.</ref>

The next recorded activity of ''El Oriente'' was on 29 July, when she was acquired by the U.S. Navy and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] the same day with [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] William Delahanty, [[United States Naval Reserve Forces|USNRF]], in command. ''El Oriente'' was assigned to the [[Naval Overseas Transportation Service]] (<small>NOTS</small>) and carried animals and supplies for the U.S. Army,<ref name=DANFS /> joining her two sister ships, {{USS|El Sol|ID-4505|2}} and {{USS|El Occidente|ID-3307|2}} in that duty.<ref name=DANFS-sisters />

''El Oriente''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first Navy voyage to France began when she sailed from Newport News with 500 animals on 11 August. Unlike earlier animal transport crossings for the Army, where there was as much as a 4% mortality rate, the voyages in August 1918 and after carried a transport veterinarian and a permanent veterinary detachment to care for the animals while on board the ship. As part of this new program, ''El Oriente'' delivered her full load of horses and mules<U+2014> suffering no losses<U+2014>at [[Bordeaux]] on 2 September. ''El Oriente'' made an additional roundtrip with 500 more animals in October, losing only three of her equine cargo during the voyage.<ref name=NNVet /> ''El Oriente'' continued sailing for the <small>NOTS</small> through April 1919,<ref name=DANFS /> sometimes carrying a small numer of troops on return voyages to the United States.<ref>{{cite news | title = 4,067 Yanks back in U. S. | work = Chicago Daily Tribune | date = 6 April 1919 | page = 8 }}</ref> At that time ''El Oriente'' was converted to carry troops, and assigned to the [[Cruiser and Transport Force]] to help return larger numbers American servicemen from Europe.<ref name=DANFS />

She sailed on 11 June for Bordeaux and returned with officers and men of the [[6th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|6th Cavalry Regiment]] on 4 July. She made additional voyages in July and August, returning 978 members of the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] on the latter voyage.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A01E4D6133DE533A25756C2A96E9C946896D6CF | format = pdf | title = Third men arrive home | work = The New York Times | date = 25 August 1919 | accessdate = 2008-08-07 | page = 8 }}</ref> In all, ''El Oriente'' returned 2,986 healthy and wounded American servicemen from France in three voyages.<ref>Gleaves, pp. 254<U+2013>55</ref> On 15 September at Philadelphia, ''El Orente'' was decommissioned, and returned to the Morgan Line soon after.<ref name=DANFS /><ref group=Note>Gleaves (p. 255) reports that ''El Oriente'' was given to the [[Ward Line]] in August 1919, which contradicts the entry in the ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'', and the information in the Miramar Ship Index, a database of historical ship information (See: {{cite web | url = http://www.miramarshipindex.org.nz/ship/show/163624 | title = El Oriente | work = Miramar Ship Index | publisher = R.B.Haworth | accessdate = 2008-08-07 }}.)</ref>

== Interwar civilian service ==
''El Oriente'' resumed cargo service with the Morgan Line, and enjoyed a quiet career, typically sailing between New York and Galveston.<ref>See, for example: {{cite news | title = Shipping and mails  | work = The New York Times | date = 1 September 1936 | page = 43 }}</ref> One event of note occurred in February 1922 when, ''El Oriente'' came upon the wreck of the [[schooner]] ''Caldwell H. Colt'', which had run aground on a reef near the [[Dry Tortugas|Tortugas Light]] during a gale. When ''El Oriente'' came upon the hulk, only her captain remained alive, surviving without food or water for several days before his rescue. ''El Oriente'' continued on to Galveston and landed the man there.<ref>{{cite news | title = Seven perish at sea as vessel hits reef | work = The New York Times | date = 23 February 1922 | page = 8 }}</ref>

== World War II ==
In June 1941, the [[United States Maritime Commission]] (USMC) announced that it had requisitioned the entire Morgan Line fleet of ten ships, including ''El Oriente'' and her remaining sister ships, ''El Occidente'' and ''El Mundo''.<ref group=Note>The fourth sister, {{SS|El Sol||2}}, had been involved in a collision in 1927 and had been scrapped afterwards. See: Colton, [http://www.shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/1major/active/newportnews.htm Newport News Shipbuilding].</ref> The ships were to finish previously scheduled cargo runs and be handed over to the USMC over the following six weeks. The USMC had been charged with assembling a {{GRT|2,000,000}} U.S. fleet to "aid the democracies" fighting Germany in [[World War II]],<ref>{{cite news | title = Government takes Morgan Line ships | work = The New York Times | date = 11 June 1941 | page  = 43 }}</ref> and paid $4.7 million for the ships and a further $2.6 million for repairs and refits.<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Associated Press]] | title = House group finds U.S. lost in ship deal | work = The Washington Post | date = 9 December 1944 | page = 5 }}</ref>

''El Oriente'' was handed over to the USMC and assigned to [[United States Lines|United States Lines, Inc.]], for operation. The cargo ship was placed under [[Panama]]nian registry by U.S. Lines. Little is known of ''El Oriente''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s movements over the next eight months, but on 17 February ''El Oriente'' sailed from [[Houston, Texas]], to Philadelphia and on to [[Reykjavik]]. From Reykjavik, she sailed to the [[River Clyde|Clyde]], arriving there at the end of July. Over the next 5 months, ''El Oriente'' sailed around the [[British Isles]], calling at [[Kirkwall]], [[Belfast Lough]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]], and [[Liverpool]], and back to Clyde in late December. From there, she sailed on one trip to [[Murmansk]] where she arrived on 27 January 1943.<ref name=CPDB>{{cite web | title = Port Arrivals/Departures: El Oriente | url = http://convoyweb.org.uk/ports/index.html?search.php?vessel=EL+ORIENTE~armain | work = Arnold Hague's Ports Database | publisher = Convoy Web | date =  | accessdate = 2008-08-07 }}</ref> 

Murmansk had limited port facilities and slow unloading of cargo (often performed by Soviet women and political prisoners), which, coupled with inclement weather and long waits for convoy escorts, often required lengthy stays by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] cargo ships. ''El Oriente'' was no exception, staying in Murmansk for nearly five weeks. To compound the lengthy wait (and, often, accompanying boredom) faced by cargo ships waiting to unload, the nearest German airfield was {{convert|35|mi|km}} away<U+2014>about 7 to 10 minutes flying time<U+2014>which gave almost no advance warning of air raids. German dive bombers would silently glide in below Soviet anti-aircraft fire, drop their payloads, and fly away. ''El Oriente'' was caught in one such attack on 27 February, with four of the ship's [[Naval Armed Guard]]smen killed in the attack.<ref>Morison, pp. 370<U+2013>72.</ref>

''El Oriente'' departed [[Kola Inlet]] on 1 March and returned to Liverpool, from which she sailed in a convoy for New York on 6 April,<ref group=Note>''El Oriente''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sister ship ''El Mundo'' sailed in the same convoy, Convoy ON 177. See: {{cite AHCD | convoytype = ON | convoynumber = 177 | accessdate = 2008-08-07 }} The two sailed together in three more convoys<U+2014>HX 251, HX 286/WN 573, and EN 381/ON 236<U+2014>throughout the rest of the war. See: {{cite web | title = Port Arrivals/Departures: El Oriente | url = http://convoyweb.org.uk/ports/index.html?search.php?vessel=EL+ORIENTE~armain | work = Arnold Hague's Ports Database | publisher = Convoy Web | date =  | accessdate = 2008-08-07 }}</ref> and returned to Belfast Lough in late June. After calling at [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]] and [[Milford Haven]], ''El Oriente'' began two roundtrips to New York at the end of June. In October the ship visited [[Loch Ewe]], [[Methil]], and [[Immingham]] before returning to New York again in November. After another transatlantic crossing and circuit amongst British ports, ''El Oriente'' returned to New York in May 1944.<ref name=CPDB />

In June, the cargo vessel sailed to Cuba, calling at [[Havana]] and [[Puerto Tarafa]] before returning to New York. She next sailed to [[Gua<U+00ED>ra]], Brazil; [[Maracaibo]], Venezuela; and [[J<U+00FA>caro]], Cuba, before returning to New York in mid August. ''El Oriente'' sailed to Philadelphia in mid September in preparation for a [[ship chartering|charter]].<ref name=CPDB />

== Red Cross ship ==
On 28 September 1944, ''El Oriente'' was chartered by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], reflagged as a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] ship, and renamed SS ''Henri Dunant'' (sometimes spelled as ''Henry Dunant''), after Red Cross movement founder [[Henry Dunant]].<ref name=PMARS-C1F /><ref name=Swiss_ships>{{cite journal | last = Walser | first = H. | title = History of the Swiss flag at sea | url = http://www.swiss-ships.ch/berichte-buecher/berichte/artikel_h-walser.htm | format = reprint | month = April | year = 1999 | journal = Ships Monthly | accessdate = 2008-08-07 }}</ref> She was last of 14 ships chartered by Swiss interests to sail under the [[Flag of Switzerland|Swiss flag]] during World War II.<ref name=Swiss_ships /> On 5 October, ''Henry Dunant'' departed Philadelphia with a cargo of mail and 900,000 food parcels intended for [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] interned in [[Germany|German]] camps.<ref>{{cite news | title = More help to prisoners | work = The New York Times | date = 5 October 1944 | page = 8 }}</ref>

''Henri Dunant'' continued sailing for the ICRC through 24 October 1945. The ship returned to Norfolk, resumed her former name of ''El Oriente'', and entered the [[James River Reserve Fleet]] on 7 November 1945.<ref name=PMARS-C1F>{{cite web | url = http://www.pmars.imsg.com/NewCards/1390_2559AF.jpg | format = scan of record | title = Custody Card (front) | work = Property Management & Archive Record System (PMARS) | publisher = [[United States Maritime Administration]] | date = [[1946-07-03]] | accessdate = 2008-08-07 }}</ref><ref name=PMARS-D1B>{{cite web | url = http://www.pmars.imsg.com/DisposalCard/All/1390_AF.jpg | format = scan of record | title = Disposal Card (front) | work = Property Management & Archive Record System (PMARS) | publisher = [[United States Maritime Administration]] | date = [[1946-07-03]] | accessdate = 2008-08-07 }}</ref> On 3 July 1946, ''El Oriente'' was sold for scrapping to the Patapsco Scrap Co., of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], for $12,175.<ref name=PMARS-C1F />
