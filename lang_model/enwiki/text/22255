The '''Oregon State Capitol''' is the building housing the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly|state legislature]] and the offices of the [[Governor of Oregon|governor]], [[Oregon Secretary of State|secretary of state]], and [[Oregon State Treasurer|treasurer]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]]. It is located in the [[List of capitals in the United States|state capital]], [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]]. The current building, constructed from 1936 to 1938, and expanded in 1977, is the third to house the [[Government of Oregon|Oregon state government]] in Salem. Two former capitol buildings were destroyed by fire, one in 1855 and the other in 1935. 

New York architects [[Trowbridge & Livingston]] conceived the current structure's [[Art Deco]] design, in association with Francis Keally. Much of the interior and exterior is made of [[marble]].  The Oregon State Capitol was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988.<ref name=ORNRHP>{{citeweb|title=Oregon National Register List|url= http://www.oregon.gov/OPRD/HCD/NATREG/docs/oregon_nr_list.pdf |publisher=[[Oregon State Parks and Recreation Department]] |accessdate=2007-10-01|format=PDF}}</ref>

The [[Public Works Administration]], part of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]], partially financed construction, which was completed during the [[Great Depression]], in 1938. The building was erected at a cost of [[United States dollar|$]]2.5 million for the central portion of the building, which includes a [[dome]] of {{convert|166|ft|m|0}}. The wings, which doubled the floor space of the building to about {{ft2 to m2|233750|precision=0}}, were added later for $12.5 million. The grounds outside the capitol building contain artwork, fountains, and flora, including the state tree ([[Douglas-fir]]) and state flower ([[Oregon-grape]]).

On January 13, 1855, the [[Oregon Territorial Legislature]] passed a bill moving the seat of government from Salem to [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]]. Governor [[George Law Curry]] and many others objected to the move, since public buildings in Salem were already under construction. Curry sent the matter to the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], where Secretary [[James Guthrie (American politician)|James Guthrie]] declared the move invalid unless acted on by the [[United States Congress]]. Thereafter, Curry and Oregon Secretary of State [[Benjamin Harding]] moved back to Salem.<ref name="Horner"/>

On December 3, 1855, the legislature convened in Corvallis and quickly introduced legislation to move the capital back to Salem. This bill passed on December 15, 1855. Three days later, the legislature re-convened in Salem. However, the statehouse burned down on the 29th, and the legislature re-opened debate about where to seat the capital. They decided to ask the people of the territory to vote on the question. A vote was to be held in June 1856, after which the two cities receiving the most votes would have a [[Two-round system|runoff]]. The initial vote set up a runoff between [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]] and Corvallis, but after some ballots were invalidated due to not being cast in accordance with the law, the two winners were Eugene and Salem. An October runoff gave Eugene the most votes, but the earlier vote-tossing led to a low turnout. With such low public participation, the election was ignored, and the capital remained in Salem.<ref name="Horner"/>

A permanent resolution of the capital location issue came in 1864. In 1860, the legislature put the question once again to a popular vote. On a vote in 1862, no city received the 50 percent minimum required by law. In an 1864 election, Salem received 79 percent and was declared the state capital.<ref name="Horner"/> The [[Oregon Constitution]] lists the seat of state government in Article XIV as Marion County,<ref name=eoo>''The Encyclopedia of Oregon''.

On April 25 at 6:43 p.m., a custodial engineer called the Salem Fire Department to report smoke. Citizens helped to remove items from the smoky building, but when firefighters arrived, they ordered everyone to leave the structure, which was soon engulfed in flame. Among the helping citizens was twelve-year-old [[Mark Hatfield]], who later became governor. It was determined the fire started in the basement of the east wing and quickly spread to piles of old records. A strong updraft in the hollow columns enclosing the dome<U+2019>s eight supporting steel lattice girders pulled the flames through the rotunda to upper stories.<ref name=SOH/> The intense heat burned even the copper dome and lit the night sky.<ref name=capitol50>{{cite news | author = Filips, Janet | title = A capitol idea | work= [[The Oregonian]] | date = September 27, 1988}}</ref>

Construction of the newest building began on December 4, 1936.<ref name=belton/> The third state capitol was completed in 1938 and is the fourth-newest capitol in the United States. The capitol was dedicated on October 1, 1938, with speeches from [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Leslie M. Scott]], [[Robert W. Sawyer]], and Oregon Governor [[Charles Henry Martin]]. Chosen from 123 entries in a countrywide competition, the design of the new building deviated from the normal design of state capitol buildings. The design was labeled a combination of [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Egyptian]] simplicity and [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Greek]] refinement.<ref name=capitol50/> Overall it is Art Deco in style, and is one of only three state capitols in the United States constructed in that architectural style.<ref>Esteve, Harry. Capitol scene 2001 Oregon Legislature. ''[[The Oregonian]]'', January 8, 2001.</ref>

Controversy occurred before construction began when Governor Martin suggested the new building be sited on a hill south of downtown (Candelaria Heights) and away from the busy center of town. Another proposal called for the purchase of the Willamette University campus and relocation of the capitol to that site.<ref>[http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/50th/hutchinson/hutchinsoncapitol.html The Oregon State Capitol: What Could Have Been...] [[Oregon State Archives]]. Retrieved on October 8, 2007.</ref> However, downtown merchants were able to keep the capitol building in downtown at the original location, though some [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] homes were subsequently leveled to make way for the building. Another early complaint about the structure was that the [[cupola]] resembled a "paint can" rather than traditional domes on other capitols, including the earlier Oregon structures. It was even called a "squirrel cage", lacking in majesty. Additionally, the public was slow to admire the gold [[Oregon Pioneer]] atop the dome.<ref name=capitol50/> Installation of the statue began on September 17, 1938, and took several days and heavy-duty equipment.<ref>{{cite news | title = Oregon<U+2019>s Bronze <U+201C>Pioneer<U+201D> Rises to Resting Place on Capitol Top | work = [[Statesman Journal]] | date = September 18, 1938}}</ref>

The building cost $2.5 million, of which the federal government paid 45 percent through the [[Public Works Administration]]. Upon completion, the new capitol was {{convert|164|ft|m}} wide, {{convert|400|ft|m}} long, and {{convert|166|ft|m}} tall (50 by 122 by 51 m) and contained {{ft2 to m2|131750|precision=-1}} of usable space.<ref name=eoo/><ref name=belton/> The exterior was finished with Vermont [[marble]].

==Exterior and interior==
[[File:Oregon State Capital rotunda.JPG|thumb|left|Interior ceiling of the dome above the [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]]]]
The Oregon State Capitol is home to both branches of the state legislature, the House and Senate, and has offices for the governor, treasurer, and the secretary of state. In its center, the floor of the prominent [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] features an embedded [[Seal of Oregon|Oregon State Seal]] sculpted in bronze by [[Ulric Ellerhusen]]. Ellerhusen also sculpted the [[Oregon Pioneer (statue)|Oregon Pioneer]] that rests atop the capitol dome's exterior. The dome rises {{convert|106|ft|m|0}} above the state seal. The interior of the dome was painted by [[Frank H. Schwarz]] and features 33 stars, symbolizing Oregon's place as the 33rd state to join the Union. Eight medallions are painted near the top of the walls of the rotunda that represent the eight objects in the state seal.<ref name=osch/> Also encircling the interior of the rotunda are four murals depicting moments from Oregon history.<ref name=tour/> One mural depicts Captain [[Robert Gray (sea-captain)|Robert Gray]]'s [[Gray sails the Columbia River|exploration of the Columbia River]] in 1792, another shows the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], and two others portray [[Conestoga wagon|covered wagons]] from pioneer times. These four murals were painted by Schwarz and [[Barry Faulkner]]. Other murals include the [[Provisional Government of Oregon]]'s salmon and wheat seal, the [[Oregon Territory]]<U+2019>s seal, and depictions of Oregon's industries, all located in the rotunda's wings along the grand staircase. The capitol's galleria area on the first floor includes hearing rooms, display cases, and the visitor information area.<ref name=osch/>

Oregon<U+2019>s House chamber floor is covered with a custom carpet; the carpet's pattern incorporates a depiction of the state tree, Douglas-fir, representative of [[forestry]]. The furniture and paneling of the chamber is made of golden [[oak]]. A large mural painted by Faulkner, depicting the 1843 [[Champoeg Meetings]] at which the provisional government was formed, is behind the desk of the Speaker of the House. The Senate chambers use [[black walnut]] for the paneling and furniture. Another custom carpet lines the floor, featuring [[chinook salmon]] and [[wheat]], representative of [[fishing]] and [[agriculture]]. The Senate<U+2019>s large mural was painted by Schwarz and depicts a street scene showing news of statehood reaching Salem. Lining the walls of both chambers are 158 names, inscribed in [[frieze]]s, of prominent people in Oregon's history. On the second floor of the capitol is the Governor<U+2019>s suite, consisting of a ceremonial office and private offices for the state<U+2019>s chief executive. As in the Senate chamber, the paneling is of black walnut. The ceremonial office includes a fireplace with a painting by Faulkner. In the suite<U+2019>s reception area is a table made of 40 tree species.<ref name=osch/> This table is inlaid with a replica of Oregon's second capitol building, the state flower (Oregon-grape), and the state bird ([[Western Meadowlark]]).<ref name=capguide>Oregon Capitol Guide.

[[File:ORCapSteps.JPG|thumb|Main entrance [[relief]] sculpture]]
A variety of artwork is displayed on the exterior of the building. Sculptor [[Leo Friedlander]] used Vermont marble for the large relief sculptures on both sides of the main entrance. One sculpture depicts Meriwether Lewis, William Clark, and [[Sacagawea]], with a map of their expedition's route on the reverse; the other shows pioneers and a covered wagon, with a map of the [[Oregon Trail]] on the reverse. Additionally, Ellerhusen created five marble relief sculptures on the exterior, and a metal sculpture by Tom Morandi sits above the south entrance. Ellerhusen also cast six bronze sculptures arranged above the building's main entrance, three on the inside and three on the outside.<ref name=osch/>

The building measures 693 by 259.5&nbsp;ft (211.2 by 79.1 m). The older main portion of the building is {{convert|53.5|ft|m|1}} tall, while the newer wings added in 1977 are {{convert|68.7|ft|m|1}} tall. Inside, the building has approximately {{ft2 to m2|233750|precision=-1}} of floor area and 3.2&nbsp;million cubic feet (90,600&nbsp;cubic meters) of volume.<ref name=capguide/>

In 1997, the Legislative Assembly established the [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[Oregon State Capitol Foundation]] in order to "create a living history, enhance the dignity and beauty of the Capitol, and foster cultural and educational opportunities." In 2005, the foundation completed the Walk of the Flags project, a display in Willson Park on the capitol grounds of all 50 [[flags of the U.S. states]].<ref>{{cite web
