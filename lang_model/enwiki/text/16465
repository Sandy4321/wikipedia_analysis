An '''album''' is a musical recording originally in [[gramophone record|gramophone]] or [[LP record|vinyl]] format, then in other formats such as [[Compact Cassette]], [[Compact disc]], and increasingly in [[Digital recording|digital]] format such as [[MP3]]. Audio albums in physical form are often provided with decorative covers ([[cover art]]) and [[liner notes]] and inserts about the music and recording, giving background information and analysis of the recording, [[lyrics]] and [[libretto]]s, images of the performers, and other images and text, as well as thanking contributors.<ref name="Album Cover Art Series">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockartpictureshow.com/vinylgallery|accessdate=30 May 2012|title=Album Cover Art Series|publisher=Rock Art Picture Show}}</ref> When supplied with compact discs they are known as [[CD booklets]].<ref name="The history of the CD - The 'Jewel Case'">{{cite web|url=http://www.research.philips.com/technologies/projects/cd/jewelcase.html|accessdate=30 May 2012|title=The history of the CD - The 'Jewel Case'|publisher=Philips Research}}</ref>

Historically, the term "album" came from a collection of some form, and in musical usage the word was used for collections of short pieces of [[printed music]] from the early nineteenth century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldandsold.com/opera/music-3.shtml|title=''Mendelssohn And Schumann''|accessdate=29 May 2012|publisher=Old and Sold}}</ref> Later, collections of related [[78rpm record]]s were bundled in book-like albums<ref>http://www.alancross.ca/a-journal-of-musical-things/2012/7/15/life-after-the-album-is-going-to-get-weird.html</ref> (one side of a [[78 rpm#78 rpm recording time|78 rpm record]] could hold only about 3.5 minutes of sound). When [[long-playing record]]s were introduced, a collection of pieces on a single record was called an album; the word was extended to other recording media such as [[compact disc]], [[MiniDisc]], [[Compact audio cassette]], and digital or [[MP3]] albums, as they were introduced.<ref name="About Vinyl Records" />

The introduction of CDs to radio caused a bit of a crisis for a generation of DJs, who didn't know whether an album of music on a CD should still be called an ''album'', as they had all grown up with 33-rpm LPs, which they considered synonymous with albums.

==History ==
An album is a book used for the collection and preservation of miscellaneous items such as [[Photo album|photographs]], [[Stamp album|postage stamps]], [[Clipping (publications)|newspaper clippings]], visitors' comments, etc.<ref name=oed>Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed.</ref> The word later became widely used to describe a collection of [[audio recording]]s ([[Exempli gratia#exempli gratia|e.g.]], pieces of music) on a single [[gramophone record]],<ref name=oed/> [[compact Cassette|cassette]], [[compact disc]], or via [[digital distribution]] .{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}{{or|date=March 2014}}

== Vinyl records ==
[[Image:1980s albums by Uncle Bonsai.jpg|left|thumb|225px|Two vinyl records with inner and outer album sleeves]]
{{Main|LP record}}

Vinyl [[Long Play|LP]] records have two sides, each comprising one half of the album. If a [[pop music|pop]] or [[rock music|rock]] album contained tracks released separately as commercial [[single (music)|singles]], they were conventionally placed in particular positions on the album.<ref name="About Vinyl Records">{{cite web|url=http://www.recordcollectorsguild.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=44&page=1|accessdate=29 May 2012|title=About Vinyl Records|publisher=Record Collector's Guild}}</ref>
A common configuration was to have the album led off by the second and third singles, followed by a ballad. The ''first'' single would lead off side 2. In the past many singles (such as the [[Beatles]]' "[[Hey Jude]]" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[Positively 4th Street]]") did not appear on albums, but others (such as the Beatles' "[[Come Together]]" and Dylan's "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]") formed part of an album released concurrently. Today, many commercial albums of [[music track]]s feature one or more singles, which are released separately to radio, TV or the Internet as a way of promoting the album.<ref name="Chronology: Technology and the Music Industry">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/music/inside/cron.html|accessdate=30 May 2012|title=Chronology: Technology and the Music Industry|publisher=Callie Tainter}}</ref> Albums have also been issued that are compilations of older tracks not originally released together, such as singles not originally found on albums, [[b-sides]] of singles, or unfinished "demo" recordings.<ref name="About Vinyl Records" />

Album sets of the past were sequenced for [[record changers]]. In the case of a two-record set, for example, sides 1 and 4 would be stamped on one record, and sides 2 and 3 on the other. The user would stack the two records onto the spindle of an automatic record changer, with side 1 on the bottom and side 2 (on the other record) on top. Side 1 would automatically drop onto the [[Phonograph|turntable]] and be played. When finished, the tone arm's position would trigger a mechanism which moved the arm out of the way, dropped the record with side 2, and played it. When both records had been played, the user would pick up the stack, turn it over, and put them back on the spindle&mdash;sides 3 and 4 would then play in sequence.<ref name="About Vinyl Records" /> Record changers were used for many years of the LP era, but eventually fell out of use.

==Compact cassette==

{{Main|Compact Cassette}}

The Compact Cassette was a popular medium for distributing pre-recorded music in the late 1970s through to the 1990s. The very first "Compact Cassette" was introduced by [[Philips]] in August 1963 in the form of a prototype.<ref name="History of Compact Cassette" /> Compact Cassettes became especially popular during the 1980s after the advent of the [[Sony Walkman]], which allowed the person to personally control what they listen to.<ref name="History of Compact Cassette" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1907884,00.html|title=''A Brief History of The Walkman''|accessdate=31 May 2012|publisher=Time|first=Meaghan|last=Haire|date=1 July 2009}}</ref> The [[Sony Walkman|Walkman]] was convenient because of its size, the device could fit in most pockets and often came equipped with a clip for belts or pants.<ref name="History of Compact Cassette" /> Compact cassettes also saw the creation of [[Mixtape]]s, which are tapes containing a compilation of songs created by any average listener of music.<ref name="Mixtape History">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/mixtape/news_feature_021003/index8.jhtml|accessdate=5 July 2012|title=Mixtape History|publisher=MTV}}</ref> The songs on a Mixtape generally relate to one another in some way, whether it be a conceptual theme or an overall sound.<ref name="Mixtape History" /> The compact cassette used double-sided [[magnetic tape sound recording|magnetic tape]] to distribute music for commercial sale.<ref name="History of Compact Cassette">{{cite web|url=http://vintagecassettes.com/_history/history.htm|accessdate=30 May 2012|title=History of Compact Cassette|publisher=Vintage Cassettes}}</ref><ref name="The History of Recorded Music">{{cite web|url=http://www.soc.duke.edu/~s142tm01/history4.html|accessdate=30 May 2012|title=The History of Recorded Music|publisher=Music Cd Industry}}</ref> The music is recorded on both the "A" and "B" side of the tape, with cassette being "turned" to play the other side of the album.<ref name="History of Compact Cassette" /> Compact Cassettes were also a popular way for musicians to record "[[Demo (music)|Demos]]" or "Demo Tapes" of their music to distribute to various record labels, in the hopes of acquiring a [[recording contract]].<ref name="The Death of the Demo Tape (At Last)">{{cite web|url=http://wfmu.org/~davem/docs/demotape.html|accessdate=5 July 2012|title=Demo Tapes|publisher=Dave Mandl}}</ref> The sales of Compact Cassettes eventually began to decline in the 1990s, after the release and distribution [[Compact Disc]]s. After the introduction of Compact discs, the term "Mixtape" began to apply to any personal compilation of songs on any given format.<ref name="Mixtape History" /> Recently there has been a revival of Compact Cassettes by [[independent record label]]s and [[Do it yourself|DIY]] musicians who prefer the format because of its difficulty to [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|share over the internet]].<ref name="Cassette Revival">{{cite web|url=http://www.mediageek.net/tag/cassette-revival|accessdate=5 July 2012|title=Cassette Revival|publisher=Mediageek}}</ref>

==Compact disc==

{{Main|Compact disc}}

The Compact Disc's format replaced both the vinyl record and the cassette as the standard for the commercial mass-market distribution of physical music albums.<ref name="The history of the CD - The beginning">{{cite web|url=http://www.research.philips.com/technologies/projects/cd/index.html|accessdate=30 May 2012|title=The history of the CD - The beginning|publisher=Philips Research}}</ref> After the introduction of [[music download]]ing and the [[iPod]], US album sales dropped 54.6% from 2001 to 2009.<ref name="Us Album Sales">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/stories/012709album|accessdate=5 June 2012|title=Scary Stat: Album Sales Down 54.6 Percent Since 2000...|publisher=Digital Music Newss}}</ref> The CD is a digital [[data storage device]] which permits [[digital recording]] technology to be used to record and play-back the recorded music.<ref name="The History of Recorded Music" /><ref name="The history of the CD - The beginning" />

==Length==
According to the rules of the [[UK Album Chart|UK Charts]], a recording counts as an "album" if it either has more than four tracks or lasts more than 25 minutes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/docs/NEW_Album_Chart_Rules_2007_2.pdf |title=Rules For Chart Eligibility - Albums |accessdate=2007-04-20 |date=January 2007 |format=pdf |publisher=[[The Official UK Charts Company]]|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070627231755/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/docs/NEW_Album_Chart_Rules_2007_2.pdf |archivedate = June 27, 2007}}</ref> Sometimes shorter albums are referred to as "[[mini-album]]s" or [[Extended play|EPs]].<ref name="As albums fade away, music industry looks to shorter records">{{cite web|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2010/jan/04/albums-fade-away-music-industry-looks-shorter-reco/?breakingnews|accessdate=1 June 2012|title=As albums fade away, music industry looks to shorter records|publisher=Associated Press}}</ref> Albums such as ''[[Tubular Bells]]'', ''[[Amarok (Mike Oldfield album)|Amarok]]'', ''[[Hergest Ridge (album)|Hergest Ridge]]'' by [[Mike Oldfield]], and [[Yes (band)|Yes]]'s ''[[Close to the Edge (Yes album)|Close to the Edge]]'', include fewer than four tracks. Other artists such as [[Pinhead Gunpowder]] refer to their own releases under 30 minutes as "albums" despite the normal distinction.

If an album becomes too long to fit a single vinyl record or CD, a recording artist may make the decision to release a [[double album]] where two vinyl [[Long Play|LPs]] or compact discs are packaged together in a single case, or a [[triple album]] containing three LPs or compact discs.

Recording artists who have an extensive back catalog will often re-release several CDs in one single box with a unified design, often containing one or more albums, or a compilation of previously unreleased recordings. These are known as [[box set]]s. Some musical artists have also released more than three compact discs or LP records of new recordings at once, in the form of boxed sets, although in that case the work is still usually considered to be an album.

==MP3 albums, and similar==
The [[MP3]] audio format has come along, revolutionizing the concept of digital storage.  Early MP3 albums were basically CD-rips created by early CD-ripping software, and sometimes real-time rips from cassettes and vinyls.

The so-called "MP3 album" isn't necessarily just in MP3 file format, in which higher quality formats such as [[FLAC]] and [[WAV]] can be used on storage mediums that MP3 albums reside on, such as [[CD-R]]-ROMs, [[hard drive]]s, [[flash memory]] (e.g. [[thumbdrive]]s, [[MP3 player]]s, [[SD card]]s), etc.

==Studio album== 
A studio album is an album of [[audio recording]]s made up of tracks recorded in a [[recording studio]]. A studio album contains newly written and recorded or previously unreleased or remixed material, distinguishing itself from a [[compilation album|compilation]] or reissue album of previously recorded material, or [[live album|live recording]] made at a performance venue. A studio album is usually planned and scheduled in advance, and may take anywhere from a few days to several years to complete. Some studio albums may include one or more [[Cover version|covers]], occasionally as live tracks within the studio album. Studio albums may also feature guest [[performers]] or session musicians that would not usually perform live with the artist. A studio album may also be released or rereleased years after it has been recorded, or even posthumously, containing material recorded before the death of the artist. The majority of studio albums contain an abundance of editing, sound effects, voice adjustments, etc. With [[History of sound recording|modern recording technology]], musicians can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening to the other parts using [[headphones]]; with each part recorded as a [[Multitrack recording|separate track]]. With a theoretically infinite number of tracks available with many modern [[Digital audio workstation|computer]] and [[Hard disk recorder|hard disk]] based recording systems (the only limit being processing power and size of the recording medium), one song can consist of hundreds of recorded tracks, employing dozens of overdubs and complex layering of instruments. This allows studio albums to be considerably more complex than [[live album]]s, and can potentially be compiled of 'perfect' takes of the same part.

Although studio albums can be recorded using large multitrack systems with many overdubs and different takes of the same instrument, many albums are still recorded live by the musician(s), in order to reproduce the feel and energy of a live performance. Often basic parts such as [[drums]] and rhythm guitar will be recorded live, then overdubs such as solos and vocals recorded later. Studio albums are often recorded, [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] and [[Audio mastering|mastered]] at different facilities, often due to touring restrictions and time constraints of the artist or [[financial]] considerations.

A studio album will often consist of songs which will be played in a different order live, or in some cases rarely or never played at all after the album or its accompanying tour. Concept albums and rock operas, such as those by [[Pink Floyd]], are often played in their entirety live, usually in the same order as the album, and featuring the same instrumentation (and even the same [[sound effect]]s) in the album's accompanying tour. Though studio albums may not include [[Single (music)|singles]] released at the same time, the single is usually one of the album's songs, and is meant to promote sales of the album as well as the single itself.
