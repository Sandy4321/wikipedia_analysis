'''''The Slip''''' is the seventh studio album by American [[industrial rock]] band [[Nine Inch Nails]], released on July 22, 2008. It was the fourth consecutive Nine Inch Nails release to be produced by frontman [[Trent Reznor]] with collaborators [[Atticus Ross]] and [[Alan Moulder]].  The album was released for free under a [[Creative Commons]] ([[BY-NC-SA]]) license, with the message from Reznor, "this one's on me."<ref name="LA Weekly">{{cite web

''The Slip'' was originally intended to be an [[extended play|EP]], but eventually grew to be a full-length album.  It was recorded, performed, and released in three weeks; Reznor released the album's only single, "[[Discipline (Nine Inch Nails song)|Discipline]]", to radio stations himself, less than 24&nbsp;hours after it was mastered by Moulder. Critical reception of the album has been generally favorable, and its unorthodox method of release attracted significant media attention.  The album peaked at number&nbsp;13 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

==Production==
===Background and recording===
Nine Inch Nails front man [[Trent Reznor]] announced in 2007 that the band had completed its contractual obligations to its record label, [[Interscope Records]], and would no longer be working with the company.  Reznor also revealed that Nine Inch Nails would likely distribute any future material independently.<ref name="Interscope split">{{cite web

Reznor returned to writing soon after the release of ''Ghosts'', and after a month of work ''The Slip'' was performed and recorded in three weeks of studio time at Trent Reznor's  in-home studio.<ref name="Frustration and Fury">{{cite web

Many critics noted how tracks on ''The Slip'' echoed musical stylings from the band's past, and that the record contained musical allusions to older Nine Inch Nails records.  Anastasia Pantsios of the ''[[Cleveland Free Times]]'' said that "''The Slip'' more or less sums up the terrain Reznor's covered in his nearly two-decade career", and went on to compare the album sound with the "edgy but irresistible beats" of ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' and ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'', and "the elusive atmospherics" of ''[[The Fragile]]''.<ref name="Cleveland Free Times">{{cite journal

Lyrically, Eric Harvey of [[Pitchfork Media]] compared "Discipline" to one of Nine Inch Nails's first singles, "[[Head Like a Hole]]", saying "['Discipline'] comes from a long-established and now label-free artist trying to reflexively reassert his position in the pop landscape, on his own terms. [...] 'Discipline' evinces Reznor's desire for some sort of framework [...] In relative terms, 'I need your discipline/ I need your help' is sure a long way from the nearly 20-year-old 'Head Like a Hole' refrain 'I'd rather die/ Than give you control'."<ref name="Pitchfork review">{{cite web

In commenting on the album, Reznor has said that it derived from "a weird sense of being outside [himself] in isolation and watching [himself] getting older."<ref name="It's Fun"/>  He also described it as "a quickly assembled album", and as "more of a sketch than a painting."<ref>{{cite journal

[[Rob Sheridan]], in collaboration with Reznor, was the album's art director, as he had been for the previous three Nine Inch Nails studio albums, ''Ghosts I<U+2013>IV'' (2008), ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'' (2007), and ''[[With Teeth]]'' (2005).
