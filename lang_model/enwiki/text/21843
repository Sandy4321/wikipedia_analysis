'''Typhoon Agnes''' produced among the heaviest rains recorded during the 20th century in [[South Korea]], with {{convert|28|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=flip}} falling over a two-day span. The storm originated as a [[Tropical cyclone#Tropical depression|tropical depression]] near [[Guam]] on August&nbsp;25, 1981. Moving along a west-northwest to northwest track, the system gradually strengthened as deep [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] organized around it. The depression [[tropical cyclone naming|was assigned the name]] ''Agnes'' on August&nbsp;27 following the development of gale-force winds. Further intensification to typhoon-status occurred by August&nbsp;29. Agnes attained its peak intensity on August&nbsp;31 over the [[East China Sea]] as a [[SSHS|Category&nbsp;2-equivalent]] on the [[Saffir<U+2013>Simpson hurricane wind scale]] with winds of 175&nbsp;km/h (110&nbsp;mph).{{#tag:ref|All winds are one-minute sustained unless otherwise noted.|group="nb"|name="winds"}} Subsequent interaction with a [[Trough (meteorology)|mid-latitude trough]] induced an [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical transition]] as the cyclone slowed and turned north. The system had lost most of its tropical characteristics by September&nbsp;1, with the majority of convection [[wind shear|sheared]] northeast over [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]]. Agnes later accelerated northeast and completed its transition on September&nbsp;3. The remnants continued along this course, impacting northern Japan and the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] before last being noted on September&nbsp;6 near the [[International Dateline]].

Throughout the course of Agnes' existence, several countries were affected by torrential rains and typhoon-force winds. Hardest hit was South Korea where record-breaking rains triggered widespread flooding. More than 12,000&nbsp;structures were damaged or destroyed by the storm and 191,000&nbsp;acres of farmland was inundated. A total of 113&nbsp;people lost their lives in the country while damage reached $134&nbsp;million. Taiwan saw similarly destructive rains which left 32&nbsp;people dead of missing. A further 14&nbsp;lives were lost in mainland China where coastal flooding from the typhoon's slow movement coincided with the [[spring tide]], resulting in the greatest [[storm surge]] since 1949 along the [[Yangtze]] [[estuary]] and [[Hangzhou Bay]]. Much of Japan saw rains from the storm, though no significant damage or loss of life took place in the country.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Agnes 1981 track.png}}
On August&nbsp;23, 1981, following several days of tranquil weather, a [[Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough]] (TUTT) began building westward from the [[International Dateline]], near [[Wake Island]]. Over the following 36&nbsp;hours, an expansive area of [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] developed southwest of the organizing TUTT. On August&nbsp;25, surface observations on [[Guam]] in the [[Mariana Islands]] indicated the presence of a [[Low-pressure area|low pressure system]].<ref name="ATCR">{{cite report|author=[[Lieutenant (junior grade)|LTJG]] Robert C.

Following improvement in the convective structure, the JTWC began warning on the cyclone as ''Tropical Depression 18W'' at 18:00&nbsp;UTC, at which time the depression was situated roughly 665&nbsp;km (415&nbsp;mi) west-northwest of Guam.<ref name="ATCR"/>

Tracking west-northwest and later northwest around the southwestern edge of a [[subtropical ridge]], steady intensification of the cyclone ensued. Early on August&nbsp;27, a reconnaissance plane measured a central pressure of 994&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 29.36&nbsp;inHg) and flight-level winds of {{convert|53|mph|km/h|abbr=on|disp=flip}}, indicating the system had become a tropical storm.{{#tag:ref|The flight-level winds were measured at an altitude of {{convert|1500|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}}.<ref name="ATCR"/>|group="nb"|name="flight level"}} In light of this, the JTWC [[Tropical cyclone naming|assigned the name]] ''Agnes'' to the storm.<ref name="ATCR"/>{{#tag:ref|The Japan Meteorological Agency also referred to the system as Agnes, though maintains it as ''Typhoon 8118'' in their official database.<ref name="JMA"/>|group="nb"|name=""}} Additionally due to its proximity to the [[Philippines]], the [[PAGASA|Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] dubbed the system with the local name ''Pining''.<ref>{{cite report|author=Michael V.

A large, [[Rainband|banding]] [[Eye (cyclone)|eye-feature]] developed within the core of Agnes as it approached the [[Ryukyu Islands]] of southwestern [[Japan]]. The storm passed 170&nbsp;km (105&nbsp;mi) south of [[Okinawa]] around 06:00&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;30 and emerged over the [[East China Sea]]. Early on August&nbsp;31, Agnes achieved its peak strength with winds of 175&nbsp;km/h (110&nbsp;mph) and an estimated central pressure of 947&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 27.96&nbsp;inHg). This ranked it as a [[SSHS|Category&nbsp;2-equivalent]] on the [[Saffir<U+2013>Simpson hurricane wind scale]].<ref name="ATCR"/> The JMA estimated the system to have been slightly weaker, with ten-minute sustained winds of 150&nbsp;km/h (90&nbsp;mph) and a pressure of 950&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 28.05&nbsp;inHg).<ref name="JMA"/>

As the storm moved over the East China Sea on September&nbsp;1, Agnes began to interact with a mid-latitude trough situated south of [[South Korea]] and began a prolonged [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical transition]]. Increasing [[wind shear]] exposed the center of the typhoon and displaced convection to the north and east. Subsequent slowing of the cyclone's forward speed as it turned northward resulted in an extended period of heavy rain for much of South Korea. The JTWC estimated Agnes to have become predominantly extratropical by the end of September&nbsp;1, coinciding with the system weakening below typhoon intensity.<ref name="ATCR"/> The JMA, however, maintained the storm as a tropical system as it began moving northwest. The diminishing cyclone moved over the [[Korea Strait]] on September&nbsp;3 and completed its extratropical transition that afternoon. Accelerating over the [[Sea of Japan]], the remnant storm deepened slightly before striking the northern [[Japan]]ese island of [[Hokkaido]] on September&nbsp;4 with an estimated pressure of 976&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 28.82&nbsp;inHg). After moving over the [[Sea of Okhotsk]], Agnes impacted the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] of [[Russia]] on September&nbsp;5. The system then moved over the open waters of the North Pacific and was last noted near the [[International Dateline]] on September&nbsp;6.<ref name="JMA"/>

On August&nbsp;30, Typhoon Agnes moved through the southern Ryukyu Islands, bringing strong winds and heavy rain to the region. Several islands received more than {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain, and a peak value of {{convert|304|mm|in|abbr=on}} was measured on [[Ishigaki Island]].<ref name="JPrain">{{cite web|work=Digital Typhoon|publisher=National Institute of Informatics|year=2014|accessdate=July 8, 2014|title=Precipitation Summary|url=http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/cgi-bin/dt/summary_prec.pl?id=198118&lang=en&sort=total&order=dec&stype=number}}</ref> Despite passing through as a typhoon, only [[Tokashiki, Okinawa|Tokashiki]] received winds of such intensity with a peak gust of {{convert|122|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.

After moving over the Sea of Japan, the storm's remnants brought heavy rains to much of Japan the day after a 6.6&nbsp;''[[Seismic scale|M<sub>w</sub>]]'' [[earthquake]] rocked eastern parts of the country.

Though Agnes did not directly impact Taiwan, prolonged southwesterly flow associated with the typhoon brought torrential rains to the island.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Natural Hazards Earth System Sciences|publisher=Copernicus Publications|author=K.

===South Korea===
Between September&nbsp;1 and 3, torrential rains affected much of South Korea, with the heaviest falling well-ahead of the storm itself. Regarded as the heaviest on record in the 20th century, at least {{convert|28|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=flip}} fell over a two-day span in the country, resulting in tremendous [[flash flood]]ing and landslides.<ref name="ATCR"/> This surpassed the previous two-day record of {{convert|22.3|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=flip}} measured in 1928 in [[Seoul]].<ref name="ST1">{{cite news|agency=United Press International|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=September 4, 1981|accessdate=July 8, 2014|title=Typhoon Agnes Lashes S.
