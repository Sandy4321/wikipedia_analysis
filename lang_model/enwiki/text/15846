The '''Battle of the Tenaru''' (or  '''Battle of the Ilu River''') took place [[August 21]], [[1942]], on the island of [[Guadalcanal]], and was a land [[battle]] of the [[Pacific War|Pacific campaign]] of [[World War II]], between [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] (mainly [[United States Marine Corps|United States (U.S.) Marine]]) ground forces.  The battle was the first major Japanese land offensive during the [[Guadalcanal campaign]].

In the battle, U.S. Marines, under the overall command of U.S. [[Major General]] [[Alexander Vandegrift]], successfully repulsed an assault by the "First Element" of the "Ichiki" Regiment, under the command of Japanese Colonel [[Kiyono Ichiki|Kiyonao Ichiki]].  The Marines were defending the Lunga perimeter, which guarded [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]], which was captured by the Allies in landings on Guadalcanal on [[August 7]].  Ichiki's unit was sent to Guadalcanal in response to the Allied landings with the mission of recapturing the airfield and driving the Allied forces off of the island.  Underestimating the strength of Allied forces on Guadalcanal, which at that time numbered about 11,000 personnel, Ichiki's unit conducted a nighttime frontal assault on Marine positions at Alligator Creek on the east side of the Lunga perimeter.  Ichiki's assault was defeated with heavy losses for the Japanese attackers.  After daybreak, the Marine units counterattacked Ichiki's surviving troops, killing many more of them.  In total, all but 128 of the original 917 of the Ichiki Regiment's First Element were killed in the battle.

The battle was the first of three separate major land offensives by the Japanese in the Guadalcanal campaign.  After Tenaru, the Japanese realized that Allied forces on Guadalcanal were much greater in number than originally estimated and thereafter sent larger forces to the island for their subsequent attempts to retake Henderson Field.

==Background==
On [[August 7]], [[1942]], Allied forces (primarily U.S.) landed on Guadalcanal, [[Tulagi]], and [[Florida Islands]] in the [[Solomon Islands]].  The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as [[Military base|bases]] for threatening the [[materiel|supply]] routes between the U.S. and [[Australia]], and secure the islands as starting points for a [[Military campaign|campaign]] with the eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at [[Rabaul]] while also supporting the Allied [[New Guinea campaign]]. The landings initiated the six-month-long [[Guadalcanal campaign]].<ref>Hogue, ''Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal'', p. 235<U+2013>236.</ref>

Taking the Japanese by surprise, the Allied landing forces accomplished their initial objectives of [[Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo|securing Tulagi]] and nearby small islands, as well as an airfield under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal, by nightfall on [[August 8]].<ref>Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', pp. 14<U+2013>15.</ref>  That night, as the transports unloaded, the Allied warships screening the transports were surprised and defeated by a Japanese warship force of seven [[cruiser]]s and one [[destroyer]], commanded by Japanese Vice Admiral [[Gunichi Mikawa]].  Three U.S. and one Australian cruisers were sunk and one other U.S. cruiser and two destroyers were damaged in the [[Battle of Savo Island]].  Turner withdrew all remaining Allied naval forces by the evening of [[August 9]] without unloading all of the heavy equipment, provisions, and troops from the transports, although most of the divisional artillery was landed, consisting of 32 75 mm and 105 mm howitzers.  Only five days worth of rations were landed.<ref>Zimmerman, ''The Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 49<U+2013>56.</ref><ref>Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p. 11 & 16.</ref>

The Marines ashore on Guadalcanal initially concentrated on forming a defense perimeter around the airfield, moving the landed supplies within the perimeter, and finishing the airfield.  Vandegrift placed his 11,000 troops on Guadalcanal in a loose perimeter around the Lunga Point area.  In four days of intense effort, the supplies were moved from the landing beach into dispersed dumps within the perimeter.  Work began on the airfield immediately, mainly using captured Japanese equipment.  On [[August 12]], the airfield was named Henderson Field after Major [[Lofton Henderson]], a Marine aviator who had been killed at the [[Battle of Midway]].  Captured Japanese stock increased the total supply of food to 14 days worth.  To conserve the limited food supplies, the Allied troops were limited to two meals per day.<ref>Shaw, ''First Offensive'', p. 13.</ref><ref>Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p. 16<U+2013>17.</ref>

[[Image:JapaneseColIchiki.gif|175px|thumb|left|Japanese Colonel Kiyonao Ichiki, commander of the 28th Infantry Regiment.]]

In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese [[Imperial General Headquarters]] assigned the Imperial Japanese Army's 17th Army, a [[corps]]-sized command based at [[Rabaul]] and under the command of Lieutenant-General [[Harukichi Hyakutake]], with the task of retaking Guadalcanal from Allied forces.  The 17th Army, currently heavily involved with the Japanese campaign in New Guinea, had only a few units available to send to the southern Solomons area.  Of these units, the 35th Infantry Brigade under Major General [[Kiyotake Kawaguchi]] was at [[Palau]], the 4th (Aoba) Infantry Regiment was in the [[Philippines]], and the 28th (Ichiki) Infantry Regiment, under the command of [[Colonel]] Kiyonao Ichiki, was at sea enroute to Japan from [[Guam]].<ref>Miller, ''The First Offensive'', p. 96</ref>  The different units began to move towards Guadalcanal immediately, but Ichiki's regiment, being the closest, arrived first.<ref>Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p. 88, Evans, ''Japanese Navy'', p. 158, and Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 141<U+2013>143. The Ichiki regiment was named after its commanding officer. The Aoba regiment took its name from Aoba Castle in [[Sendai]], because most of the soldiers in the regiment were from [[Miyagi prefecture]] (Rottman, ''Japanese Army'', p. 52).  Although some histories state that Ichiki's regiment was at Truk, [[Raizo Tanaka]], in Evans' book, states that he dropped off Ichiki's regiment at Guam after the [[Battle of Midway]].  Ichiki's regiment was subsequently loaded on ships for transport elsewhere but were rerouted to Truk after the Allied landings.</ref>

An aerial [[reconnaissance]] of the U.S. Marine positions on Guadalcanal on [[August 12]] by one of the senior Japanese staff officers from Rabaul sighted few U.S. troops in the open and no large ships in the waters nearby, convincing Imperial Headquarters that the Allies had withdrawn the majority of their troops.  In fact, none of the Allied troops had been withdrawn.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 143<U+2013>144.</ref>  Hyakutake issued orders for an advance unit of 900 troops from Ichiki's regiment to be landed on Guadalcanal by fast warship to immediately attack the Allied position and reoccupy the airfield area at Lunga Point.  The remaining personnel in Ichiki's regiment would be delivered to Guadalcanal by slower transport later.  At the major Japanese naval base at [[Chuuk|Truk]], that was the staging point for delivery of Ichiki's regiment to Guadalcanal, Colonel Ichiki was briefed that 2,000<U+2013>10,000 U.S. troops were holding the Guadalcanal [[beachhead]] and that he should, "avoid frontal attacks."<ref>Evans, ''Japanese Navy'', p. 161, Griffith, ''Battle for Guadalcanal'', p. 98<U+2013>99 and Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p. 31.</ref>

Ichiki and 916 of his regiment's 2,300 troops, designated the "First Element" and carrying seven days' supply of food, were successfully delivered to Taivu Point, about 35 kilometers (22&nbsp;mi) east of Lunga Point, by six destroyers at 01:00 on [[August 19]].<ref>Evans, ''Japanese Navy'', p. 161, Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 145, Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 204, 212, Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p. 70, and Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p. 43.  The First Element troops were mainly from the 28th's 1st Battalion under a Major Kuramoto and were mostly from [[Asahikawa, Hokkaid<U+014D>]].  At Taivu Point was a Japanese outpost with about 200 naval personnel who assisted with the unloading of Ichiki's forces from the destroyers.</ref>  Leaving about 100 personnel behind as a rear guard, Ichiki marched west with the remaining 800 men of his unit and made camp before dawn about 14 kilometers (9&nbsp;mi) east of the Lunga perimeter.  The U.S. Marines at Lunga Point received [[military intelligence|intelligence]] that a Japanese landing had occurred and took steps to find out exactly what was happening.<ref>Griffith, ''Battle for Guadalcanal'', p. 99<U+2013>100 and Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p. 29 & 43<U+2013>44.</ref>

==Battle==
===Prelude===
[[Image:GuadCoastwatcher.gif|250px|thumb|right|British Solomons Island's Protectorate district officer and coastwatcher Martin Clemens (center standing) with members of the Solomon Islands police force, who served as scouts and guides for Allied forces throughout the Guadalcanal campaign.]]

Reports to Allied forces from patrols of Solomon Islanders, including retired Sergeant Major [[Jacob C. Vouza]] of the Native Constabulary, under the direction of [[Martin Clemens]], a [[coastwatchers|coastwatcher]] and officer in the [[British Solomon Islands Protectorate Defence Force]] (BSIPDF), along with Allied intelligence from other sources, indicated that Japanese troops were present east of Lunga Point.  To investigate further, on [[August 19]], a  Marine patrol of 60 men and four native scouts, commanded by U.S. Marine [[Captain (military)|Captain]] Charles H. Brush, marched east from the Lunga Perimeter.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 148, Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 205.</ref><ref>Zimmerman, ''The Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 62.</ref>  At the same time, Ichiki sent forward his own patrol of 38 men, led by his communication's officer, to reconnoiter Allied troop dispositions and establish a forward communications base.  Around 12:00 on [[August 19]] at Koli Point, Brush's patrol sighted and [[ambush]]ed the Japanese patrol, killing all but five of its members, who escaped back to Taivu.  The Marines suffered three dead and three wounded.<ref>Griffith, ''Battle for Guadalcanal'', p. 100, Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 205, and Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p.47.  The U.S. and Japanese soldiers killed in this engagement are included in the total casualty figures for the Tenaru battle.  Captain Yoshimi Shibuya was the leader of the Japanese patrol.  One of the five Japanese survivors later died of his wounds at Taivu Point.</ref>  Papers discovered on the bodies of some of the Japanese officers in the patrol revealed that they belonged to a much larger unit and showed detailed intelligence of U.S. Marine positions around Lunga Point.<ref>Zimmerman, ''The Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 62</ref>  The papers did not, however, detail exactly how large the Japanese force was or whether an attack was imminent.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 149.</ref>

Now anticipating an attack from the east, the U.S. Marine forces, under the direction of General Vandegrift, prepared their defenses on the east side of the Lunga perimeter.  Several official U.S. military histories identify the location of the eastern defenses of the Lunga perimeter as emplaced on the Tenaru River.  The Tenaru River, however, was actually located further to the east.  The river forming the eastern boundary of the Lunga perimeter was actually the Ilu River, called Alligator Creek by the local inhabitants.  Alligator Creek was not really a river but a tidal [[lagoon]] separated from the ocean by a [[Bar (landform)|sandbar]] about 7 to 15 meters (25<U+2013>50 ft) in width and about 30 meters (100 ft) long.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 150.</ref>  Along the west side of Alligator Creek, Colonel [[Clifton B. Cates]], commander of the [[U.S. 1st Marine Regiment|1st Marine Regiment]], deployed his 1st and 2nd battalions.<ref>Hammel, ''Carrier Clash'', p. 135.</ref><ref>Zimmerman, ''The Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 67.</ref>  To help further defend the Alligator Creek sandbar, Cates deployed 100 men from the 1st Special Weapons Battalion with two [[M3 37 mm gun|37mm]] anti-tank guns equipped with [[canister shot]].<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 151</ref>  Marine divisional artillery, consisting of both [[75 mm Gun (US)|75mm]] and [[M101 howitzer|105mm guns]], pre-targeted locations on the east side and sandbar areas of Alligator Creek, and forward artillery observers emplaced themselves in the forward Marine positions.<ref>Griffith, ''Battle for Guadalcanal'', p. 102.</ref>  The Marines worked all day on [[August 20]] to prepare their defenses as much as possible before nightfall.<ref>Hammel, ''Carrier Clash'', p. 135.</ref>

Learning of the annihilation of his patrol, Ichiki quickly sent forward a [[Company (military unit)|company]] to bury the bodies and followed with the rest of his troops, marching throughout the night of [[August 19]] and finally halting at 04:30 on [[August 20]] within a few miles of the U.S. Marine positions on the east side of Lunga Point.  At this location, he prepared his troops to attack the Allied positions that night.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 149 & 151, and Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p. 48.</ref>

===Action===
[[Image:GuadTenaruMap.gif|300px|thumb|left|Map of the battle of [[August 21]].]]

Just after midnight on [[August 21]], Ichiki's main body of troops arrived at the east bank of Alligator Creek and were surprised to encounter the Marine positions, not having expected to find U.S. forces located "so far from the airfield."<ref>Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p. 58.</ref>  Nearby U.S. Marine listening posts heard "clanking" sounds, human voices, and other noises before withdrawing to the west bank of the creek.  At 01:30 Ichiki's force opened fire with [[machine gun]]s and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]] on the Marine positions on the west bank of the creek, and a first wave of about 100 Japanese soldiers charged across the sandbar towards the Marines.<ref>Griffith, ''Battle for Guadalcanal'', p. 102, Hough, ''Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal'', p. 290, and Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p. 58<U+2013>59.</ref>  Marine machine gun fire and canister rounds from the 37 mm cannons killed most of the Japanese soldiers as they crossed the sandbar.  A few of the Japanese soldiers reached the Marine positions, engaged in [[hand to hand combat]] with the defenders, and captured a few of the Marine front-line emplacements.  Also, Japanese machine gun and rifle fire from the east side of the creek killed several of the Marine machine-gunners.<ref>Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 210, Hammel, ''Carrier Clash'', p. 137.</ref>  A company of Marines, held in reserve just behind the front line, attacked and killed most, if not all, of the remaining Japanese soldiers that had breached the front line defenses, ending Ichiki's first assault about an hour after it had begun.<ref>Zimmerman, ''The Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 68.</ref><ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 153.</ref>  At 02:30 a second wave of about 150 to 200 Japanese troops again attacked across the sandbar and was again almost completely wiped out.  At least one of the surviving Japanese officers from this attack advised Ichiki to withdraw his remaining forces, but Ichiki declined to do so.<ref>Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p. 62<U+2013>63.</ref>

As Ichiki's troops regrouped east of the creek, Japanese mortars bombarded the Marine lines.<ref>Griffith, ''Battle for Guadalcanal'', p. 103.</ref>  The Marines answered with 75 mm and mortar artillery barrages into the areas east of the creek.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 153, and Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p. 63.</ref>  About 05:00, another wave of Japanese troops attacked, this time attempting to flank the Marine positions by wading through the ocean surf and attacking up the beach into the west bank area of the creek bed.  The Marines responded with heavy machine gun and artillery fire along the beachfront area, again causing heavy casualties among Ichiki's attacking troops and causing them to abandon their attack and withdraw back to the east bank of the creek.<ref>Griffith, ''Battle for Guadalcanal'', p. 103<U+2013>104.</ref><ref>Hammel, ''Carrier Clash'', p. 141.</ref>  For the next couple of hours, the two sides exchanged rifle, machine gun, and artillery fire at close range across the sandbar and creek.<ref>Zimmerman, ''The Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 69.</ref>

In spite of the heavy losses his force had suffered in both night assaults, Ichiki's troops remained in place on the east bank of the creek, either unable or unwilling to withdraw.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 154 and Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p. 66.</ref>  At daybreak on [[August 21]], the commanders of the U.S. Marine units facing Ichiki's troops conferred on how best to proceed, and they decided to counterattack.<ref>Hough, ''Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal'', p. 290.</ref>  The 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, under [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Lenard B. Cresswell, crossed Alligator Creek upstream from the battle area, enveloped Ichiki's troops from the south and east, cutting off any avenue for retreat, and began to "compress" Ichiki's troops into a small area in a coconut grove on the east bank of the creek.<ref>Zimmerman, ''The Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 69.</ref>  Aircraft from Henderson Field strafed Japanese soldiers that attempted to escape down the beach and, later in the afternoon, five Marine [[Stuart tank|light tanks]] attacked across the sandbar into the coconut grove.  The tanks swept the coconut grove with machine gun and canister cannon fire, as well as rolling over the bodies, both alive and dead, of any Japanese soldiers unable or unwilling to get out of the way.  When the tank attack was over, Vandegrift wrote that, "the rear of the tanks looked like meat grinders."<ref>Gilbert, ''Marine Tank Battles'', p. 42<U+2013>43, Griffith, ''Battle for Guadalcanal'', p. 106, Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 212, and Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p. 66.  Some sources state that only four tanks were involved.</ref>

[[Image:GuadTanaruDeadJapanese.gif|300px|thumb|right|Dead soldiers from Ichiki's forces lie partially buried on the sandbar of Alligator creek after the battle.]]

By 17:00 on [[August 21]], Japanese resistance had ended.  Colonel Ichiki was either killed during the battle, or committed ritual suicide ([[seppuku]]) shortly thereafter, depending on the account.  As curious Marines began to walk around looking at the battlefield, some injured Japanese troops shot at them, killing or wounding several Marines.  Thereafter, Marines shot or bayonetted all of the Japanese bodies that they encountered, although about 15 injured and unconscious Japanese soldiers were taken prisoner.<ref>Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p. 71<U+2013>72.  Smith states that most Japanese survivors of the battle insist that Ichiki was killed in action, not by suicide.  After the battle, a wounded Japanese officer, apparently feigning death, shot and seriously wounded an inspecting Marine with a small pistol before being killed by another Marine, Andy Poliny. Poliny believes that this was Ichiki.</ref><ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 156.  Frank states that the official Japanese Defense Agency history of the battle says that Ichiki committed suicide in the seppuku manner.  However, one Japanese survivor's account states that Ichiki was last seen advancing towards the U.S. Marine lines.</ref>  About 30 of the Japanese troops escaped to rejoin their regiment's rear echelon at Taivu Point.<ref>Hough, ''Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal'', p. 291 and Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p. 43 and 73.  Since 100 troops were left behind as a rear guard and 128 of the unit survived the battle, that means that about 30 escaped from the engagement back to the rear guard area.</ref>

==Aftermath==
For the U.S. and its allies, the victory in the Tenaru battle was psychologically significant in that Allied soldiers, after a series of defeats to Japanese army units throughout the Pacific and east Asia, now knew that they could defeat Japanese troops in a land battle.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 157.</ref>  The battle also set another precedent that would continue throughout the war in the Pacific, which was the reluctance of defeated Japanese soldiers to surrender and their efforts to continue killing Allied soldiers, even as the Japanese soldiers lay dying on the battlefield.  On this subject [[Alexander Vandegrift|Vandegrift]] remarked, "I have never heard or read of this kind of fighting.  These people refuse to surrender.  The wounded wait until men come up to examine them...and blow themselves and the other fellow to pieces with a hand grenade."<ref>Griffith, ''Battle for Guadalcanal'', p. 107</ref>

By [[August 25]], most of Ichiki's survivors reached Taivu Point and radioed Rabaul to tell 17th Army headquarters that Ichiki's detachment had been "almost annihilated at a point short of the airfield."  Reacting with disbelief to the news, Japanese army headquarter's officers proceeded with plans to deliver additional troops to Guadalcanal to reattempt to capture Henderson Field.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 158 and Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p. 74.</ref>  The next major Japanese attack on the Lunga perimeter occurred at the [[Battle of Edson's Ridge]] about three weeks later, this time employing a much larger force than had been employed in the Tenaru battle.
