'''''Futurama''''' is an Emmy Award-winning [[United States|American]] [[animated television series|animated]] [[sitcom]] created by [[Matt Groening]] (creator of ''[[The Simpsons]]'') and [[David X. Cohen]] for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]]. The series follows the adventures of a former [[New York-style pizza|New York City pizza]] delivery boy, [[Philip J. Fry]] after he is [[Cryonics|cryogenically frozen]] at midnight, [[December 31]], [[1999]], and is revived one thousand years in the future. 

The series aired from [[March 28]], [[1999]] to [[August 10]], [[2003]]. Although ''Futurama'' was never officially canceled, Fox decided not to renew for a fifth season and the program fell apart soon after.<ref name="FuturamaCancelled">{{cite web|url=http://www.gotfuturama.com/Futurama/News/1053009995,66450,/|title=Can't Get Enough Futurama &mdash; "Remeber Me after my Death!" (sic)|accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref> However, Matt Groening has revealed that after the successful revival of the ''[[Family Guy]]'' series, [[20th Century Fox]] Television approached him to produce a direct to DVD Futurama movie. That one DVD turned into four and [[Comedy Central]] entered into an agreement with 20th Century Fox Television to syndicate the existing episodes and air the new movies as new episodes in an episodic format.<ref name=RottenTomatoesMattGroenigClarifiesFuture>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/comments/?entryid=397361|title="Groening's Bargain to Yield Four Futurama Movies"|publisher=Reuters|date=[[Jan 28]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-02-15}}</ref><ref name=reuters>{{cite web|author=Wallenstein, Andrew|url=http://entertainment.tv.yahoo.com/entnews/va/20060622/115104459800.html|title="Futurama" gets new life on Comedy Central|publisher=Reuters|date=[[June 22]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-10-08}}</ref>

The name "Futurama" comes from an exhibit from the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] of the [[Futurama (New York World's Fair)|same name]]. Designed by [[Norman Bel Geddes]], the exhibit depicted what he imagined the world to look like in 1959.

The 20th Century Fox logo at the end of each broadcast is altered for this series to read "30th Century Fox", as it is based in the 30th century. In the DVD commentary for the first season, the producers stated that they created the logo themselves when Fox refused to produce a new logo for them.

==Cast and characters==
{{Spoiler}}
{{seealso|List of recurring robot characters from Futurama|List of recurring human characters from Futurama|List of recurring alien characters from Futurama|List of Futurama animals|List of secondary characters from Futurama}}

[[Image:Futurama characters.jpg|thumb|right|300px|From left to right: [[Doctor Zoidberg|Dr. Zoidberg]], [[Professor Hubert Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]], [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]], [[Amy Wong|Amy]], [[Hermes Conrad|Hermes]] (in sand), [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]], and [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]].]]

* '''[[Philip J. Fry]]''' ([[Billy West (voice actor)|Billy West]]) &mdash; Fry was cryogenically frozen for one thousand years just after midnight on New Year's Day, 2000, reawakening on New Year's Eve, 2999. This makes him 1025 years old chronologically, yet physically he is merely 25. He got a job at Planet Express, a company owned by his closest living relative Professor Hubert Farnsworth, where he works as a delivery boy.

* '''[[Leela (Futurama)|Turanga Leela]]''' ([[Katey Sagal]]) &mdash; Leela is the competent, [[cyclops|one-eyed]] captain of the [[Planet Express Ship]]. Abandoned at birth, she grew up in the [[orphanage|Cookieville Minimum Security Orphanarium]] believing herself to be an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] from an unknown race. She eventually learns from her parents that she is, in fact, a [[List of recurring non-robot characters from Futurama#Sewer mutants|mutant]].

* '''[[Bender (Futurama)|Bender Bending Rodr<U+00ED>guez]]''' ([[John DiMaggio]]) &mdash; Bender is a [[profanity|foul-mouthed]], [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]], [[cigar]]-[[Tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[kleptomaniac]]al, [[misanthropy|human hating]], [[egocentrism|egocentric]], ill-tempered [[robot]] originally programmed to bend [[girder]]s. He is Fry's best friend and [[roommate]]. He has a dislike of almost all humans and other beings (excluding Fry and<U+2014>to a lesser extent<U+2014>Leela). Bender sometimes works as the ship's [[Cook (profession)|cook]], but is horrible at it. He primarily assists in delivering cargo from ship to planet. Bender was built on a production line in [[Tijuana, Mexico]]. He secretly wishes to be a folk singer which reveals itself on a few occasions when he becomes inadvertently attached to a magnet.

* '''[[Professor Hubert Farnsworth]]''' a.k.a. The Professor ([[Billy West (voice actor)|Billy West]]) &mdash; Born April 9, 2838, Professor Hubert Farnsworth is Fry's distant nephew. Biologically, he is older than Fry; however, chronologically, Fry is by far the elder of the two. Farnsworth founded Planet Express to fund his [[mad scientist]]-esque experiments and inventions. He eventually clones himself from one of his own warts, resulting in the creation of [[Cubert Farnsworth]].

* '''[[Doctor Zoidberg|Doctor John Zoidberg]]''' ([[Billy West (voice actor)|Billy West]]) &mdash; Zoidberg is a [[lobster]]-like alien from [[Decapod 10]], and is the staff doctor (of questionable competence) of Planet Express. He speaks with an accent most commonly associated with native [[Yiddish]] speakers (in commentaries, Billy West has cited [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]] and [[Lou Jacobi]] as inspirations for Zoidberg's voice), while being generally viewed with amusement and derision by his peers at Planet Express.  His knowledge of human anatomy and physiology is woefully inadequate.  He is penniless and usually eats the garbage that he finds in a [[Dumpster (term)|dumpster]] outside Planet Express headquarters, or anything else he can scrounge.

* '''[[Amy Wong]]''' ([[Lauren Tom]]) &mdash; Amy is an incredibly rich, spoiled, blunt, and extremely accident-prone [[intern]] at Planet Express.  She is an engineering student at Mars University and heiress to half of [[Mars]].  Born on [[Mars]], she is ethnically [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], prone to frequently cursing in [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]], and using 31st century slang. Her aging parents are obsessed with having a grandchild.

* '''[[Hermes Conrad]]''' ([[Phil LaMarr]]) &mdash; Hermes is the [[Jamaica]]n accountant of Planet Express. A [[bureaucrat]] and proud of it, he is a stickler for regulation. Hermes is also a former champion in Olympic Limbo, a sport derived from the [[Limbo (dance)|popular dance]] and similar to the track event of [[hurdling]]. He has a wife, LaBarbara, and a 12-year old son named Dwight.

==Setting==
[[Image:Futurama - The Future.jpg|thumb|right|Fry's first glimpse of New New York City]]
''Futurama'''s setting is first and foremost a backdrop, and the writers are not above committing [[continuity error]]s if they serve to further the gags. The world of tomorrow is used to highlight and lampoon issues of today, and to parody the science fiction genre. 

''Futurama'' is set at the beginning of the 31st century, in a time filled with technological wonders. [[Global warming]], inflexible [[bureaucracy]], and [[substance abuse]] are a few of the subjects given a 31st century exaggeration in a world where the problems have become both more extreme and more common. In a jab at segregation, for example, the show depicts the human prejudice against [[Mutation|mutants]] as being so great that the latter have been forced to live underground in the sewers. The characters' home on Earth is the city of [[List of Futurama places#New New York|New New York]], built over the ruins of present-day [[New York City]], referred to as "Old New York".

Numerous technological advances have been made by the 31st century. The ability to keep heads alive in jars was invented by [[Ron Popeil]] (who has a guest cameo in "[[A Big Piece of Garbage]]"), and has resulted in many political figures and celebrities being active; this became the writers' excuse to feature and poke fun at celebrities in the show. Curiously, several of the preserved heads shown are those of people who were already dead well before the advent of this technology.  The Internet, while being fully immersive and encompassing all senses and seeming to feature its own digital world (similar to [[Tron (film)|''Tron'']] or [[The Matrix series|''The Matrix'']]), is slow and consists mostly of [[pornography]], [[pop-up ad]]s, and "filthy" [[chat room]]s, though some of it is edited to include educational material ostensibly for youth. [[Television]] is a primary form of entertainment, though the resolution is much higher than modern day television. Robots, powered by either alcohol or mineral oil are commonplace, and most have free will and emotions. [[Wheel|The wheel]] is obsolete, having been forgotten and replaced by hovering vehicles and transportation tubes; these are reminiscent of old-style [[pneumatic tube]]s. In the episode "[[Mother's Day (Futurama)|Mothers Day]]," Fry builds a carriage employing wheels, albeit malformed, to carry his friends because of a robot rebellion, and none of the other characters recognize the wheels - although Leela suggests that they would work better if they were round.

===Galactic politics===
[[Image:Earth Flag.svg|thumb|left|Earthican flag, "Old Freebie"]]
[[Image:Doop logo.png|thumb|right|116px|The Democratic Order Of Planets logo]]
Earth has a [[Earth Government (Futurama)|unified government]], headed by the [[President of Earth]] (from season 2 onwards being [[Richard Nixon's Head]]). Earth's capital is [[Washington, D.C.]] and the flag of Earth looks similar to the [[flag of the United States]], only with planet Earth displayed in place of the fifty stars. Citizens of Earth are referred to as ''Earthicans''.

The ''Democratic Order Of Planets'' ([[D.O.O.P.]]) is the fictional organization in the ''Futurama'' universe which has been compared to both the [[United Nations]] and to the [[United Federation of Planets]] of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe. It includes Earth and many other worlds, though Earth sometimes acts unilaterally without the aid of other D.O.O.P. members. [[Omicron Persei VIII]] is frequently engaged in conflicts with the D.O.O.P.

Numerous other [[galaxy|galaxies]] have been colonized or have made contact by the year 3000. Much of the [[Solar System]] now operates under the Earth government's [[sphere of influence]]. Mars has been [[terraforming|terraformed]], and is home to [[Mars University]]. The Western Hemisphere of Mars is owned by the [[Amy Wong|Wong family]].

===Linguistics===
There are two alien languages that appear often in the background. The first language (Alienese<ref name="LeelasHomeworld">{{cite episode| episodelink=Leela's Homeworld| title=Leela's Homeworld| series= Futurama| serieslink=Futurama}}</ref>) is a simple [[substitution cipher]] from the [[Latin alphabet]].<ref name="AlienAlphabet1">{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/futurama.htm|title=Omniglot|accessdate=2006-06-13}}</ref> The second (Beta Crypt III<ref name="LeelasHomeworld" />) uses a more complex [[modulo|modular]] addition code.<ref name="TheDaytheEarthStoodStupid">{{cite episode| episodelink=The Day the Earth Stood Stupid| title=The Day the Earth Stood Stupid| series= Futurama| serieslink=Futurama| minutes=[[Audio Commentary]] 11}}</ref> They often provide additional jokes for fans dedicated enough to decode the messages. Aside from these languages, most of the displayed wording on the show is in English, and most of the alien species encountered speak English. 

[[Image:Alien decoder.PNG|right|thumbnail|220px|Alien Language 1 and its equivalent [[Latin alphabet|Latin characters]].]]
Additionally, several English expressions have evolved since the present day. For example, the word ''[[Christmas]]'' has been replaced with ''[[Xmas]]'', and ''ask'' has become an [[archaic]] pronunciation of ''aks'' ([[homophone|homophonous]] with ''axe''). According to multiple episodes (and the season one DVD commentary) [[French language|French]] is a [[extinct language|dead language]] in the ''Futurama'' universe, much like [[Latin]] is in the present.

==Humor==
Although the series utilized a wide range of styles of humor, including [[self-deprecation]], [[black comedy]], [[off-color humor]], [[slapstick]], and [[surreal humor]], its primary source of comedy was its [[Satire|satirical]] depiction of everyday life in the future, and its [[parody|parodical]] comparisons of which to the present.<ref name="locus">Cook, Lucius ([[April 26]], [[2004]]). [http://www.locusmag.com/2004/Reviews/04Cook_Futurama.html Hey Sexy Mama, Wanna Kill All Humans?: Looking Backwards at Futurama, The Greatest SF Show You've Never Seen]. [[Locus Online]]. Retrieved on [[January 27]], [[2007]].</ref> Matt Groening notes that from the show's conception, his goal was to take what was on the surface a goofy comedy and show that underneath were "legitimate literary science fiction concepts".<ref name="tvsquad">Keller, Joel ([[January 31]], [[2007]]). [http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/01/31/matt-groening-talks-about-futuramas-comeback/ Matt Groening talks about Futurama's comeback]. [[TV Squad]]. Retrieved [[February 1]], [[2007]].</ref> The series contrasted "[[high culture]]" and "[[low culture]]" comedy; for example, Bender's [[catchphrase]] (and his first line on the show) is the insult "''Bite my shiny metal [[arse|ass]]''," while his most terrifying nightmare is a vision of an [[Arabic alphabet#Numerals|Arabic numeral]] ''2'', a joke referencing the [[binary numeral system]].<ref name="locus"/>

[[Image:Kleins-beer (futurama).jpg|thumb|right|170px|"Klein's Beer" is sold in [[Klein bottle]]s, one of many [[mathematical joke]]s]]
The series developed a [[Cult television|cult following]] partially due to the large number of [[in-joke]]s, most of which were aimed at "[[nerd]]s".<ref name="locus"/> In [[Audio commentary|commentary]] on the [[DVD]] releases, David X. Cohen points out and sometimes explains his "nerdiest joke[s]." These jokes included [[mathematical joke]]s, such as the "(<math>\aleph_0</math>)plex" ([[aleph number|aleph-null]]<nowiki>plex</nowiki>) movie theater in "[[Raging Bender]]", as well as various forms of [[science humor]]. For example, Professor Farnsworth complains that judges of a [[Photo finish|"quantum" finish]] "''changed the outcome by measuring it''" in "[[Luck of the Fryrish]]," a reference to the [[Observer effect#Use in science|observer effect]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. Over its run, the series passed references to [[quantum chromodynamics]] (the appearance of [[Strong interaction|Strong Force]] brand glue in "[[30% Iron Chef]]"), [[computer science]] (two large books in a closet labeled [[Complexity classes P and NP|''P'' and ''NP'']] in "[[Put Your Head on My Shoulders]]"), and [[genetics]] (a mention of Bender's "[[RNA|robo-, or ''R''NA]]" in "[[Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles]]"). The show often featured subtle references to classic [[science fiction]], most often ''[[Star Trek]]'' - many [[soundbyte]]s are used in the series as [[homage]]<ref name="locus"/> - but also others, such as the reference to the origin of the word ''[[robot]]'' made in the existence of a robot-dominated planet named [[Karel <U+010C>apek|Chapek]] 9.

Mid-way through the production of the fifth season of ''Futurama'', FOX decided to let ''Futurama'' go out of production and told the writers and animators to look for new jobs.<ref name="FoxStopProduction">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20030419181300/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/02021902.shtml|title=BBC News &mdash; "Silver screen Simpsons, Futurama facing finish?"|accessdate=2006-06-14}}</ref> A Fox spokeswoman told website Zap2it that "Fox has decided not to order more episodes at this time, but we may do so in the future."

In October 2005, [[Comedy Central]] picked up the exclusive cable syndication rights to air ''Futurama'''s 72-episode run at the start of 2008, following the expiration of [[Adult Swim]]'s current deal.<ref name=variety>{{cite web|author=Dempsey, John|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117931802?categoryid=14&cs=1|title="Futurama" in Comedy Central's future via big deal|publisher=Variety|date=[[October 27]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2005-10-27}}</ref> It was cited as the largest and most expensive acquisition in the network's history.

===Future and DVD movies===
{{future film}}
On [[April 26]], [[2006]], [[The A.V. Club]] published an interview with ''Futurama'' co-creator Matt Groening, in which he discussed plans to create four straight-to-DVD movies. Groening noted that co-creator David X. Cohen and numerous writers from the original series would be returning to work on the movies.<ref name="DVDMovieAnnounced">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771/1|title=Matt Groening|accessdate=2006-06-14}}</ref>

On [[June 22]], [[2006]], Comedy Central announced that at least 13 new episodes were to be produced, to air with the reruns in 2008. Comedy Central also confirmed that [[Billy West (voice actor)|Billy West]], [[Katey Sagal]], and [[John DiMaggio]] would return for the new episodes, with a 2008 debut planned;<ref name="reuters"/>  however, an unofficial fan site reports that the new Comedy Central episodes would consist of the straight-to-DVD movies, each split into 4 episodes (making 16 new episodes) rather than additional new material.<ref name="gotfuturama">{{cite web|url=http://www.gotfuturama.com/|title=www.gotfuturama.com|accessdate=2006-11-06}}</ref>
According to an interview with David X. Cohen,<ref name="wizuniverse">{{cite web|url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/toyfare/002710592.cfm|title=www.wizarduniverse.com|accessdate=2006-12-14}}</ref> the ''Futurama'' team are around half way through writing the new season, and Rough Draft Studios have just started animating. The new season will be set two years after the events of the last season, and will re-visit Fry and Leela's relationship and unanswered questions about Nibbler, dark matter and Seymour the dog.

The first movie, currently under the working title ''[[Futurama: Bender's Big Score]]'', is in production. The film is written by [[Ken Keeler]] and David X. Cohen, and will include return appearances by the [[Nibblonians]], Seymour, Barbados Slim, [[List of recurring non-robot characters from Futurama#Morbo|Morbo]], [[List of recurring robot characters from Futurama#Robot Santa|Robot Santa]], [[Godfellas|the "God" space entity]], [[List of recurring non-robot characters from Futurama#Al Gore|Al Gore]], and [[Zapp Brannigan]].<ref name="AIC-BendersBigScore">{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=24076|title=Ain't It Cool News: "Ben Sinister Has Read The New FUTURAMA 'Movie'!!"|accessdate=2006-09-18}}</ref> In an appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', Al Gore confirmed that he would appear in the movie, playing his disembodied head. David X. Cohen later confirmed that he would also appear in the new season, and would be involved in a storyline which will show "what really determined the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election".

In January 2007, Futurama creator Matt Groening clarified speculation as to whether Futurama had been revived in episodic or feature-film form, telling the website rottentomatoes.com ''"We're writing them as movies and then we're going to chop them up, reconfigure them, write new material and try to make them work as separate episodes."''

:'''''Note:''''' ''The box sets represent the original lineup of the series, before FOX changed the order of the episodes. FOX split the series up into five seasons, while originally four were planned. The episodes airing as season five were made up of episodes originally from seasons three and four that weren't aired during the FOX run.''

==''Futurama'' in other media==
===Comic books===

{{mainarticle|Futurama Comics}}

First started in November 2000, ''Futurama Comics'' is a comic book series published by [[Bongo Comics]] based in the ''Futurama'' universe. The comic is the only part of the ''Futurama'' franchise which is still being published to date. While originally published only in the US, a UK and Australian version of the series is also available. Other than a different running order and presentation, the stories are the same in all versions.

Much like the TV series, each comic has a caption at the top of the cover. For example: "Made In The USA! (Printed in Canada)". Some of the UK and Australian comics have different captions on the top of their comics (for example, the Australian version of #20 says "A 21st Century Comic Book" across the cover, while the US version does not have a caption on that issue). All series contain a letters page, artwork from readers and previews of other Bongo Comics coming up.

The Futurama comics may not be "canonical" ''per se'', and while they do draw from the Futurama universe, the events portrayed within them do not necessarily have any effect upon the continuity of the show.

===Toys and figurines===

While relatively uncommon, several action and tin figurines of various characters and items from the show have been made and are being sold by various hobby/online stores. The collectible releases include a set of bendable action figures, including Lieutenant [[Kif Kroker]], Turanga Leela, and Bender. There have also been a few figures released by Moore Action Collectibles, including Fry, Turanga Leela, Bender, and the Planet Express Ship. Lastly, in late 2006, Rocket USA brought out a limited edition 'super' heavyweight die cast Bender. Another special edition Bender figure was released at the San Diego Comic Con (SDCC) in 2006. The figure was called "Glorious Golden Bender".

[[Toynami]] has recently announced new ''Futurama'' figures which are currently to be released in [[2007]].<ref name="Toynami Figurines">{{cite web|url=http://www.action-figure.com/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=19970|title=Futurama SDCC Exclusive and Toy news|accessdate=2006-09-05}}</ref>

==Futurama cameos and references==
