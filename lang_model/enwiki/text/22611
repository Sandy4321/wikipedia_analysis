'''St. Michael<U+2019>s Choir School''' is an all-boys' semi-private school located in downtown [[Toronto]], [[Canada]] that embodies a unique learning environment for its students. The school serves as a union between two distinct institutions: the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music]] and the [[Toronto Catholic District School Board]]. While providing rigorous academic instruction, the Choir School also trains choristers and musicians.

== History ==

St. Michael's Choir School was founded in [[1937]] by [[Msgr. John Edward Ronan]] to facilitate the training of a professional boys' [[choir]] for [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Toronto|St. Michael's Cathedral]] in [[Toronto, Canada]]. The official name of the school at the time was "Cathedral Schola Cantorum" and was a privately-run institution. On [[May 17]], [[1955]], St. Michael's Choir School was accorded an affiliation with the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music]] in Rome, one of only seven choirs and choir schools in the world with such an affiliation. With its affiliation with the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music, the school has the power to grant degrees in [[Sacred Music]]{{Fact|date=October 2007}}. In 1987, the Choir School completed fifty years of service, and in recognition of this milestone, [[Art Eggleton]], the mayor of Toronto at the time, declared [[June 15]], [[1987]] as the official "St. Michael<U+2019>s Choir School Day".

== Choral Excellence ==

From its beginning, the school has provided parishes in the Toronto Diocese and beyond with [[organist]]s, [[Cantor (church)|cantor]]s, [[conducting|conductors]], and professional vocalists. The Choir sings at St. Michael's Cathedral every weekend.

St. Michael's Choir School tours twice a year--a one-week tour in December, and a two to three week concert tour immediately following Easter. Touring commenced in 1971, with the choir performing in England and Italy, and competing in (and winning) the [[International Choral Festival]] in [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. Since then, the choir has toured across Canada and the continental United States, as well as making concert appearances throughout [[Western Europe]] and in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. 

Besides touring, the choir participates in many local events. The Choir School has given Christmas concerts every year since 1937; currently they are held at [[Massey Hall]] in downtown Toronto.  The two concerts that the choir performs are popular, and the concert hall is usually filled to capacity{{Fact|date=October 2007}}. These Christmas Concerts have become a vital tradition to life at St. Michael's Choir School.

The Choir School has performed for many notable individuals, including His Holiness [[Pope John Paul II]] during the 1984 Papal Visit and during [[World Youth Day]] 2002, Her Majesty [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in October 2003 and former Canadian Prime Minister [[Jean Chr<U+00E9>tien]] in 2003. The choir also participated in a charity performance at Toronto's [[Rogers Centre]] with [[Jackie Chan]], [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]], and [[Wayne Gretzky]] in November 2001.

The choir's tradition of excellence and high standards of musical achievement have drawn parallels with the [[Vienna Boys Choir]], which St. Michael's Choir defeated in competition at the International Choral Festival.

The choir was most recently on the international stage in April 2005. A two-week tour took a choir of nearly 150 to the western Canadian provinces of [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]]. After the Canadian portion of the tour, the choir travelled to [[California]]. They visited [[Salinas]], which recently, because of municipal [[deficit]]s, closed the [[public libraries]] in the city. The chair-elect of the Salias Chamber of Commerce had seen the choir perform at St. Michael's Cathedral. He arranged to have them visit the area in late April to give [[benefit concert]]s for the Salinas libraries. Two very successful benefits were given. The first was in the town of [[Carmel-by-the-Sea]], where the choir was introduced by the Canadian consul-general in California [[Alain Dudoit]]. The final concert of the tour was to a packed house in Salinas. The concerts raised enough money to re-open partially the libraries<ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/826461701.html?dids=826461701:826461701&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Apr+25%2C+2005&author=Isabel+Teotonio&pub=Toronto+Star&edition=&startpage=B.02&desc=Choir%27s+singing+to+save+Steinbeck%3B+Students+at+rally+to+fund+libraries+in+author%27s+home+Salinas%2C+Calif.%2C+planned+to+close+its+three+branches [[Toronto Star]] article]</ref>. The appearances generated press comment from [[Toronto]] to [[Los Angeles]]{{Fact|date=October 2007}}.

In the spring of 2006, the choir travelled to [[Philadelphia]] and [[Miami]] where they performed concerts. 

On October 15th 2007, the Senior and Junior Choir performed at Roy Thompson Hall with many of the Choir School alumni including Matt Dusk, Kevin Hearn and The Barenaked Ladies. This event was a success and made possible by the SMCS Alumni to help fundraise for the Choir School.

== House system ==
