'''Fatima Jinnah Dental College''', commonly referred to by the acronym '''FJDC''', is the oldest dental school in [[Karachi]] and one of the oldest in [[Pakistan]]. Established in [[1992]], it is run and managed by a duly registered Fatima Jinnah Dental College & Hospital Trust. It offers students a four-year undergraduate program leading to a degree of Bachelor of Dental Sciences (BDS) in addition to sponsoring graduate students to post-graduate qualification of [[M.S.]], [[M.Phil]] and [[Ph.D]].<ref name="futureplanning">[http://fjdc.edu.pk/fututreplanning.htm Future Planning]</ref>

The College is affiliated with the [[University of Karachi]] and is recognized by the [[Pakistan Medical and Dental Council]] (PMDC). It is also recognised for post-graduation by [[College of Physicians & Surgeons Pakistan]]<ref name="futureplanning"/>. The college is named after Dr. [[Fatima Jinnah]], sister of the founder of the nation, [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]], who was herself a [[dentist]], and to pay homage to the services she offered to the country.<ref>[http://fjdc.edu.pk/msfatimajinnah.htm Fatima Jinnah]</ref>

==Preamble==
[[Image:Fjdc preclincal campus.jpg|thumb|left|Main Entrance Hall inside the Pre-clinical Campus of the college]] 
FJDC was established in the backdrop of a disastrous dental scenario in 1992 during which the dentist-to-population ratio of 1 dentist to nearly 85,000 people, one of the lowest in the world. In 1993, there were just over 1,200 registered dentists in Pakistan compared to 70,000 medical doctors, serving a population of well over 100 million<ref name="prospectus1">FJDC Prospectus 2005-06, Page 1</ref>. 

Therefore, in 1989, Dr. Bakar Askary, then the President of the [[Dow Medical College]] [[Students' Union]] and President [[National Students Federation]], launched a campaign for the establishment of a dental college to serve the over 12 million people of [[Karachi]]. The aim initially was to persuade the [[Government of Pakistan|Federal Government]] and the Provincial Government of Sindh to establish a dental college attached to one of the existing medical colleges in the city, specifically either the Jinnah Post-Graduate Medical Centre, Sindh Medical College, [[Dow Medical College]], or [[Civil Hospital]] as dental departments already existed in these institutions <ref name="prospectus2">FJDC Prospectus 2005-06 Page 2</ref>. 

However, by mid 1989 it was made clear that the government had no intention of establishing a dental college at [[Karachi]], but the Federal [[Government of Pakistan]], did however, as a consolation, announced later that year, that it will allow such an institution to be established in the private sector<ref name="prospectus2"/>. 

Thereafter, with the intimation to the [[Government of Pakistan|Federal Government]], Provincial Ministries for [[Health]], The [[Pakistan Medical and Dental Council]] and the [[University of Karachi]], and with all other necessary documentation, the college finally begun its first academic session in the year [[1992]]-93. The college officials consider it significant that year [[1993]] was  also the [[centenary]] year of the birth of [[Fatima Jinnah]], in whose memory the college was established, and therefore consider the college as a "gift to the Nation" on that occasion <ref name="prospectus3">FJDC Prospectus 2005-06 Page 3</ref>.

==Location and facilities==
===Pre-Clinical campus===

[[Image:FJDC pre clinical campus.jpg|frame|right|The college's Pre-Clinical Campus in [[Korangi]] Creek]]
The college had its basic sciences section for the first and second professional years housed in a private building until August 2000, when the college was permanently shifted to its permanent custom built campus in [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]] Colony in [[Korangi]] Creek Cantonment Area on the outskirts of [[Karachi]]<ref name="prospectus9">FJDC Prospectus 2005-06 Page 9</ref>. This campus is well equipped with most modern facilities, including a new [[I.T.]] Department and an audio-visual [[library]]. 

However, the campus is found wanting in some of the more basic requirements of an educational institution. For instance, there are no separate common rooms for girls or boys, and only one of the two lecture halls, is big enough to keep up with the growing number of students applying. With the number of students per batch increasing every year, the need to expand this campus will become more serious in the near future. It is rumored that the property for another new campus has already been brought, some where on [[Karachi]] Super [[Highway]], but there is no official word on it yet from the Management.

===Clinical campus===

The third and fourth professional years are taught and trained at the Fatima Jinnah Dental Hospital located at [[Azam Basti]], adjacent Phase-1 [[DHA]].<ref name="prospectus9"/> The clinical dental teaching and training facilities here are adequate, complete with independent departments for [[Prosthodontics]], [[Endodontics]] and [[Orthodontics]]. But again, these facilities may prove to be insufficient in the coming years, keeping in mind the growing number of students expected to apply in future years. It is imperative therefore that the 2nd Preclinical campus building opposite to the Hospital which is currently under construction is completed soon.

The hospital itself, however, is one of the busiest dental hospitals in the city. Since it caters primarily for the middle and lower class, patients patients are abundant, giving students vital exposure to various kinds of extensive dental procedures. This advantage is not always available to students from other dental colleges in the city, where the number of patients is far limited because of the greater cost of treatment. In addition to training at its own hospital students are also trained at the [[General Medicine]] and [[Surgery]] departments at the Rafiquee Shaheed Hospital in line with a 25-year agreement reached between the college officials and the city government.<ref name="prospectus9"/>

==Statutory and management affairs==
The college is run by The Fatima Jinnah Dental College and Hospital Trust, which is a public, charitable, non-political, non-commercial Trust that was founded by the Late Syed Hashim Raza, a high-ranking civil servant and chair person<ref name="fjdctrust">[http://fjdc.edu.pk/fjdc_trust.htm FJDC Trust]</ref>. Dr. Manzoorudin Ahmed, former [[Vice Chancellor]] [[University of Karachi]] and an [[International Relations]] expert, is the Vice Chairman. Syed Ali Akhtar, an economist by profession, who has a wide range of experience in medical management and accounts is also one of the permanent trustees<ref name="fjdctrust"/>. Other trustees include a range of well-known personalities from both the private sector, as well as the government<ref name="fjdctrust"/>.

The financial affairs are conducted by Mr. S. Ali. Akhtar, who is also a Permanent Trustee and Director Finance of the college<ref name="fjdctrust"/>. The trust has been granted Tax Exemption under Section (1)(d) of the Income Tax Ordinance of 1979<ref name="fjdctrust"/>.

==Faculty==

The college has a diversified group of experienced and qualified faculty members, including members having foreign qualifications. Apart from permanent, full-time faculty, the college also has on its rolls several visiting professors, from other reputed private and state medical and dental colleges.<ref name="futureplanning"/> Guests speakers from various walks of life and of various academic standing are also invited at regular intervals to deliver lectures and workshops ([http://fjdc.edu.pk/future_perspective.htm] & [http://fjdc.edu.pk/workshop_mcqs.htm]) with a view to enhance specific and general knowledge of both the students and the faculty.<ref name="futureplanning"/>

==Academic standing==

===Undergraduate level===

Since its inception, the college has performed extremely well in its B.D.S. program, regularly securing the top positions in the [[Karachi University]] supervised annual professional examinations (or 'profs'), together with a record number of distinctions in various subjects and an over all pass rate of 90%,<ref name="futureplanning"/> making it one of the best dental colleges in Pakistan.

Its degree is accepted as a foreign qualification in most countries including the [[United Kingdom]], [[U.S.A.]], [[U.A.E.]] & [[Germany]]. Graduates from this college are also entitled to appear in Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board Tests Examinations ([[United Kingdom|U.K.]]) and the National & State Board Examinations of [[U.S.A.]]<ref name="futureplanning"/>. They can also directly enter post-graduate programs and take up internship and training positions in most countries. They also have access to short courses and hands-on workshops conducted by various Universities and Institutions internationally<ref name="futureplanning"/>.

The Academic year is divided into semesters (whose numbers vary for students of different professional years) and teaching sessions, at the end of which an assessment is carried out to judge the performance of both the teachers and the students<ref name="futureplanning"/>. At least once a year, invigilators and examinations are invited from outside the college's own faculty staff to conduct part of the overall assessment of the students<ref name="futureplanning"/> in order to provider a broader perspective and better prepare the students for their [[Karachi University|KU]]-supervised professional examinations. Efforts are now also underway to expand the B.D.S. program to a five year course, and in this vein a 9 month Pre-Foundation Course was offered for the first time in the year 2006 to 1st year students before the start of their regular B.D.S. course.

===Post-graduate level===

The college offers a post-graduate program of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] in Pakistan, in addition, the curriculum and training of the house officer, is being constantly expanded to allow fresh graduates to immediately take various foreign as well as national post-graduate examinations. Arrangements are also being made through a linkage program with Universities and Dental Colleges in the [[United Kingdom]] for on-job training in England under the ''Overseas Dentist Training Scheme''. Arrangements are also underway with [[McGill University]], [[Canada]] and the [[Loma Linda University Medical Center]], [[U.S.A.]] for transfer of technology, exchange of faculty, assistance for post-graduation and research for residencies. <ref>FJDC Prospectus Page 10</ref>
