The '''2011<U+2013>12 Australia women's national goalball team''', known as the Belles,  played in two Paralympic qualifying competitions and the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]]. The official announcement confirming the 2011<U+2013>12 team was made in May 2012. The team included [[Jennifer Blow]], [[Meica Christensen]],  [[Michelle Rzepecki]], [[Nicole Esdaile]], [[Rachel Henderson]] and [[Tyan Taylor]]. Most of the players, with the exception of Christensen, were relatively new. Their first competition was the [[International Blind Sports Federation]] (IBSA) World Goalball Games, with the top two teams qualifying for the Summer Paralympics. While Australia finished second in its pool, it ended the tournament in sixth place following a loss to Israel.  Their second major competition was the ISBA Oceania-Africa Goalball Regional Championships, where they beat New Zealand in the semi-final, and again in the final, to qualify for the [[London 2012 Paralympic Games]].

At the Paralympics, the Belles, in the same pool as China, Japan, Canada, the United States and Sweden, played Japan first, losing 1<U+2013>3.  In their second game of pool play, they lost to Canada 1<U+2013>3.  They lost their last two games in pool play by 0<U+2013>3 to the United States and 5<U+2013>8 to Sweden. This placed them last in the pool, and they did not qualify for the finals.
