The '''inauguration of Barack Obama''' as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|44th]] [[President of the United States]] took place on Tuesday, January&nbsp;20, 2009. The [[United States presidential inauguration|inauguration]], which set a record attendance for any event held in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington,&nbsp;D.C.]], marked the commencement of the four-year term of [[Barack Obama]] as President and [[Joe Biden|Joseph Biden]] as [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. Based on the combined attendance numbers, television viewership and Internet traffic, it was among the most observed events ever by the global audience. 

"A&nbsp;New Birth of Freedom", a phrase from the [[Gettysburg Address]], served as the inaugural theme to commemorate the 200th&nbsp;anniversary of the birth year of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. In his speeches to the crowds, Obama referred to ideals expressed by Lincoln about renewal, continuity and national unity. Obama mentioned these ideals in his speech to stress the need for shared sacrifice and a new sense of responsibility to answer America's challenges at home and abroad. 

Obama and others paid homage to Lincoln in the form of tributes and references during several of the events, starting with a commemorative train tour from {{city-state|Philadelphia|Pennsylvania}} to Washington,&nbsp;D.C. on January&nbsp;17, 2009. The inaugural events held in Washington,&nbsp;D.C. from January&nbsp;18 to January&nbsp;21, 2009 included concerts, a national day of community service on [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day|Martin&nbsp;Luther King,&nbsp;Jr. Day]], the swearing-in ceremony, luncheon and parade, inaugural balls, and the interfaith [[Inaugural ceremony prayers (US presidential)|inaugural prayer]] service. The [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|presidential oath]] as administered to Obama during his swearing-in ceremony on January&nbsp;20 strayed from the oath of office prescribed in the [[United States Constitution]], which led to its re<U+2011>administration the next evening. 

In addition to a larger than usual celebrity attendance, the [[Presidential Inaugural Committee]] increased its outreach to ordinary citizens to encourage greater participation in inaugural events compared with participation in recent past inaugurations. For the first time, the committee opened the entire length of the [[National Mall]] as the public viewing area for the swearing-in ceremony, breaking with the tradition of past inaugurations. Selected American citizens participated in the train tour and other inaugural events, and a philanthropist organized a People's Inaugural Ball for disadvantaged people who otherwise would be unable to afford to attend the inaugural festivities. Among the celebrations for the inauguration, the committee hosted a first-ever Neighborhood Inaugural Ball with free or affordable tickets for ordinary citizens.

The January 20 inauguration marked the formal culmination of the [[Presidential transition of Barack Obama]] that began when he won the United States [[United States presidential election, 2008|presidential election]] on [[Election Day (United States)|November 4, 2008]], and became the [[President-elect of the United States|President-Elect]].<ref name='NYT-Nagourney-2008-11-04'> {{cite news | first= Adam | last= Nagourney | authorlink=Adam Nagourney |coauthors= | title= Obama Wins Election | date= 4 November 2008 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/us/politics/05elect.html | work=U.S. Politics | publisher =[[New York Times]] | pages = | accessdate = November 5, 2008}}</ref>  In accordance with [[Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_6:_Compensation.2C_privileges.2C_and_restrictions_on_holding_civil_office|Article I, Section 6]] of the [[United States Constitution]], Obama resigned from the [[United States Senate]] effective November 16, 2008.<ref>Letter of resignation from Barack Obama to [[Richard Cheney]], Nov. 18, 2008; published in the ''[[Congressional Record]]'', Nov. 19, 2008, page S10609 ([http://frwebgate1.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/PDFgate.cgi?WAISdocID=557516393307+3+2+0&WAISaction=retrieve Communication from the Honorable Barack Obama])</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Obama sets date to leave Senate|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/us_elections_2008/7728466.stm|date=November 13, 2008|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-11-14}}

<!--Section is being added to address the following concern: An integral element missing to this article is why this was such a notable event, why it attracted the audience it did, which was a combination of the first black president the US has ever had, and the great sigh of relief that Bush was finally leaving. The raucous celebrations that took place throughout the world upon the Obama's elections were credited to both of these causes. I think the article should start with a brief overview of the campaigns and the results of the election, including a description of the running in the streets and honking of cars etc., that occurred in many locations on election night, plus the incredible problems Obama took on from the previous administration. This ties in with the new day themes of his speeches on the train rides and why he would address crisis issues in the inauguration speech. I think it's notable that Bush was the first president since Jimmy Carter, who surprised the Secret Service by walking from the Capitol to the White House, by not walking since his limo was pelted by eggs from parade attendees. As the first black president, there were some serious concerns about Obama's safety if he decided to get out and walk, which he did. Let me know if you have questions.
        I understand that, but the lead and the entire event surrounds the throng of people, the high price of tickets, the large global audience...for a presidential inauguration? As if Obama's just another president? Well he is, but he's also the first black president and the result of a massive political shove to the previous 8-year administration. I think these issues, with the political tone of his speeches in light of the 2 wars and the near-depression he inherited are integral to the article. An immense amount of pressure was placed on Obama to fix everything, to be the panacea for Americans and this came out ceremonially in his inauguration. Can you update this sentence: ''No one from the crowds at the swearing-in ceremony and parade was arrested as of 6:00 p.m. EST on Inauguration Day''-->

Obama, who originally campaigned using the slogan "Change We Can Believe In" and later "Change We Need",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/09/obamas-change-s.html|title=Obama's 'Change' Slogan Gets a Change|accessdate=2010-02-18|date=2008-09-13|publisher=[[ABC News]] Internet Ventures}}</ref> was widely-celebrated as the first [[African American]] president of the United States and a symbol of change from his [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] predecessor, [[George W. Bush]]. Obama also represented a generational change as the first man elected President who was born in the 1960s. He inherited what [[Peter Orzag]] termed an "economic mess" that became known as the [[financial crisis of 2007<U+2013>2010]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/03/08/Orszag-Obama-inherited-economic-woes/UPI-85971236559252/|title=Orszag: Obama inherited economic woes|accessdate=2010-02-18|date=2009-03-08|publisher=[[United Press International]]}}</ref>  According to a [[CNN]] poll, he embodied youthful energy and transition at a time of economic despair, and inspired more confidence than his immediate predecessors.<ref name=kdn/>

==Planning ==
[[File:ObamaInaugurationCapitolPreparation.jpg|thumb|left|250px|alt=U.S. Capitol at dusk, mostly darkened but with dome floodlit from within|Preparations at the [[United States Capitol]]]]
The inauguration was planned primarily by two committees: the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies]] and the 2009&nbsp;Presidential Inaugural Committee. Although the election was scheduled for November 4, 2008, the congressional committee began construction of the inaugural platform on September 24, 2008.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title= Construction of 2009 Inaugural Platform Begins with the Ceremonial Driving of the "First Nail" | date= 2008-09-24 | publisher=[[United States Congress Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|United States Congress Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies]] | url = http://inaugural.senate.gov/media/releases/release-09242008-inauguralwebsite.cfm | work = Press Release | pages = | accessdate = 2009-06-25}}</ref>

===Joint Congressional Committee===
The swearing-in ceremony and the inaugural luncheon for [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] Obama and Vice President-elect Biden were planned by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, a committee composed of [[United States Senator]]s [[Dianne Feinstein]], committee chair, [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]] and [[Harry Reid]], and [[United States Representative]]s [[John Boehner]], [[Steny Hoyer]] and [[Nancy Pelosi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inaugural.senate.gov/cmte/membershiphistory.cfm|title=Membership of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|accessdate=2010-02-11|publisher=[[United States Senate]]}}</ref> The committee is overseen by the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration|U.S.&nbsp;Senate Committee on Rules and Administration]].

The congressional committee released the full schedule of the January&nbsp;20 inaugural events on December&nbsp;17, 2008. The inauguration schedule referred to the President<U+2011>elect as "Barack&nbsp;H.

}}Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] administered the oath of office of the President of the United States to Obama. Michelle Obama held the [[Lincoln Bible|Bible]], which was used by Abraham Lincoln at his 1861 inauguration, as Barack Obama placed his hand on the Bible and recited the presidential oath.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/23/obama-to-take-oath-on-same-bible-as-lincoln/|title=Obama to Take Oath on Same Bible as Lincoln|author=Seelye, Katherine Q.|work=[[The New York Times|The&nbsp;New York Times]]|date=2008-12-23|accessdate=2009-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.usatoday.com/onpolitics/inauguration/page/2/|title=Obama to be sworn in on Lincoln Bible|last=Memmott|first=Mark|date=2008-12-23|work=USA Today|accessdate=2009-05-08}}</ref> 

During the swearing-in ceremony, Obama did not recite, and Roberts as the administering official did not execute, the 35<U+2011>word oath of office exactly as prescribed by the United States Constitution. The first misstep occurred during the first part of the oath. Roberts had not yet completed the first phrase when Obama began reciting the oath. After the correct recitation of the first phrase of the presidential oath, Roberts recited incorrectly the next part of the oath by saying "that I will execute the Office of President ''to'' the United States ''faithfully''", rather than "that I will ''faithfully'' execute the Office of President ''of'' the United States". Obama recited the words "I will execute", and then paused.<ref name=NYTretake/> Roberts then tried to correct his mistake in administering the oath by reciting "faithfully the Office of President of the United States", followed by Obama repeating Roberts' first incorrect phrase.<ref name="oathflub">{{cite news |first=Pete |last=Williams |title=About That oath flub |url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/01/20/1751351.aspx |publisher=[[MSNBC.com]] |date=2008-01-20 |accessdate=2009-01-21 }}</ref><ref name=OCJRSiRoPO>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/20/chief-justice-roberts-officiates-inauguration/|title=Obama, Chief Justice Roberts Stumble in Recitation of Presidential Oath: Chief Justice John Roberts officiated over his first inauguration Tuesday by swearing in President-elect Barack Obama as president of the United States.|accessdate=2009-02-01|date=2009-01-20|publisher=[[Fox News]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/01/21/obama-re-takes-oath-of-office-at-the-white-house/|title=Obama re-takes oath of office at the White House|accessdate=2009-02-01|date=2009-01-21|publisher=[[Cable News Network]]|work=Political Ticker|author=Mears, Bill}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/01/20/1751351.aspx|title=About That Oath Flub|accessdate=2009-02-01|date=2009-01-20|publisher=[[MSNBC.com]]|author=Montanaro, Domenico }}</ref>

Roberts ended the presidential oath by appending the phrase "so help you God" to the end of the constitutionally prescribed oath, and Obama responded "[[Oath of office of the President of the United States#"So help me God"|so help me God]]" when he was prompted.

====Inaugural address====
A central theme of President Obama's inaugural address was a call to restore responsibility<U+2014>both in terms of accountability in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved.<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/20/barack-obama-inauguration-us-speech|title=Obama inauguration: Words of history&nbsp;... crafted by 27-year-old in Starbucks|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=[[United Kingdom]]|date=2009-01-20|accessdate=2009-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/18/responsibility-theme-obamas-inauguration-speech-aides-say/|title=Responsibility is the Theme of Obama's Inauguration Speech, Aides Say"|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=2009-01-18|accessdate=2009-03-04}}</ref> Obama's address did not have memorable sound bite phrases. Instead, he used traditional references to connect his new administration with the nation's history in a speech that was understated deliberately, according to rhetoric expert James Mackin.<ref name=mackin>{{cite web|url=http://tulane.edu/news/newwave/012309_inaugural_address.cfm|title=Inaugural Speech Focuses on Tradition|work=New Wave|publisher=[[Tulane University]]|date=2009-01-23|accessdate=2009-03-04}}</ref>

Obama concluded the second paragraph of his address by saying, "we the people have remained faithful&nbsp;to&nbsp;the ideals of our forebears and true to our founding documents." The speech reinforced words such as "legacy" and "heritage", as well as values such as "honesty", "courage" and "patriotism", which "are old" values. Near the end of the speech, Obama referred to words written by [[Thomas Paine]] in ''[[The American Crisis]]'', which were ordered by [[George Washington]] to be read to his troops: "Let it be told to the future world&nbsp;... that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive&nbsp;... that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it]." Because Obama's [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|campaign]] message focused on the need for change, Mackin noted that Obama sought to reassure Americans that he would operate as President within the margins of the nation's traditions.<ref name=mackin/>

As part of Obama's call for responsibility, he said "what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility<U+2014>a recognition, on the part of every American" and "those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account." Obama quoted the lyrics of the [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Dorothy Fields]] song "[[Pick Yourself Up]]" from the [[musical film|musical]] [[comedy film|comedy]] [[Swing Time (1936 film)|''Swing Time'']], saying that "starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America."<ref name="boston_globe">{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2009/01/obama_calls_for_3.html|title=Obama calls for American renewal|author=Foon Rhee|date=2009-01-20|accessdate=2009-03-04|work=[[The Boston Globe|The&nbsp;Boston Globe]]}}</ref> In an article for the ''The New York Times'', columnist and former drama critic [[Frank Rich]] noted the link to the lyric in Field's song from the movie, writing that Obama offered in his address "one subtle whiff of the [[Great Depression]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/opinion/25rich.html?em|title=No Time for Poetry|author=Rich, Frank|work=[[The New York Times|The&nbsp;New York Times]]|date=2009-01-25|accessdate=2009-01-25|p. WK10 of NY edition.}}</ref>

Obama's speech contained several [[Bible|biblical]] references and was compared to oratory of the "[[black church]] tradition." Obama also highlighted the United States' religious diversity, referring to the country's "patchwork heritage" as a strength and saying, "We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and non-believers." This was the first time a United States President acknowledged [[Irreligion in the United States|American non-believers]] in an inaugural address.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-01-20-obama-non-believers_N.htm|title=An inaugural first: Obama acknowledges 'non-believers'|accessdate=2010-02-02|date=2009-01-22|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Grossman, Cathy Lynn}}</ref>

After the inaugural ceremony, President Obama, [[First Lady]] Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden escorted former President [[George W. Bush]] and former First Lady [[Laura Bush]] to a departure ceremony on the east side of the U.S.&nbsp;Capitol. Before the luncheon and in keeping with tradition, President Obama signed his first [[Executive order (United States)|presidential orders]] in the President's Room at the Capitol,<ref name=Osfpp/> and then signed the guest book for the luncheon.<ref name=LB/> The first order signed by Obama was a proclamation declaring his Inauguration Day a "National Day of Renewal and Reconciliation",<ref name=Osfpp/> in which he called "upon all of our citizens to serve one another and the common purpose of remaking this Nation for our new century".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=31715|title=President Obama's First Presidential Proclamation|date=2009-01-21|accessdate=2010-02-07|publisher=Catholic Online}}</ref> Obama signed orders to officially present the nominations for his [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] and several sub<U+2011>Cabinet officials to the U.S.&nbsp;Congress for its approval.<ref name=Osfpp>{{cite web|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/01/20/obama-signs-first-presidential-proclamation/|title=Obama signs first presidential proclamation|publisher=[[Cable News Network]]|date=2009-01-20|accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref> The Obamas and Bidens then attended an inaugural luncheon at the U.S.&nbsp;Capitol before traveling from there to the presidential reviewing stand at the White House to watch the parade.

====Luncheon====
As former President and Mrs. Bush began their journey to their [[Texas]] home, the Obamas and Bidens joined several congressional guests for the inaugural luncheon in [[National Statuary Hall]] at the U.S.&nbsp;Capitol. Guests included top Washington lawmakers as well as former Presidents and Vice Presidents. Commemorating the [[Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial]], the red and white china used during the luncheon were [[replica]]s of those used in the Lincoln White House.<ref name=thehill>{{cite news |first=Mike|last=Soraghan|title=Obama's Inauguration makes tourists out of lawmakers |url=http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/obamas-inauguration-makes-tourists-out-of-lawmakers-2009-01-20.html |work= [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |publisher=|date=2009-01-20 |accessdate=2009-02-13}}</ref>

A luncheon at the U.S.&nbsp;Capitol has been part of the inaugural program since 1953 (before that time, the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the outgoing President and First Lady). The menu for the 2009 inaugural luncheon, which often features dishes representative of the home states of the new President and Vice President, included seafood stew, duck and [[pheasant]] entrees with [[Pinot noir]] wine, and a dessert of apple cinnamon [[sponge cake]] with sweet cream [[Candied fruit|glac<U+00E9>]]. Since 1985, a painting has served as a backdrop for the head table. For the 2009 inaugural luncheon, the featured painting was [[Thomas Hill (painter)|Thomas Hill's]] 1865 ''View of the Yosemite Valley'', a painting that commemorated Abraham Lincoln's 1864 signing of the [[Yosemite National Park#Yosemite Grant|Yosemite Grant]], which was the first time the federal government protected park lands for public use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inaugural.senate.gov/luncheon/|title= Inauguration of the President: Luncheon|publisher=[[United States Congress Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|United States Congress Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies]]|accessdate=2009-02-16}}

No official count was taken of the number of people attending the inaugural ceremony, although multiple sources concluded that the ceremony had the largest audience of an event ever held in Washington,&nbsp;D.C. Government agencies and federal officials, who coordinated security and traffic management, determined the attendance count to be 1.8&nbsp;million people based on information collected by several cameras and individuals on the ground. ''[[The Washington Post|The&nbsp;Washington Post]]'' reported the estimated crowd size for the inaugural ceremony, and the [[National Park Service]] said it did not contest the estimate.<ref name="Washington Post">{{cite-news | last=Ruane | first=Michael | title=D.C.'s Inauguration Head Count: 1.8 Million | accessdate= 2009-01-22|date= 2009-01-20| work=[[The Washington Post|The&nbsp;Washington Post]] | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/21/AR2009012103884.html}}</ref><ref name="bostonglobe-attendance">{{cite-news | last= | first= | title=Inaugural crowd size reportedly D.C. record | accessdate= 2009-01-22|date= 2009-01-22| work=[[The Boston Globe|The&nbsp;Boston Globe]] | url = http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/01/22/inaugural_crowd_size_reportedly_dc_record/}}</ref>

===Security===
The inauguration took place in an era of enhanced security in the decade following the [[September 11 attacks]]. Because of the size of the crowds expected in Washington,&nbsp;D.C. for the inaugural activities, planners raised concerns about public safety and security. [[U.S. Army|Army]] [[General (United States)|General]] Richard Rowe, head of the joint military task force for the Washington, D.C. area, explained that security forces had to stretch their imagination to anticipate previously unthinkable security threats, especially in light of the [[2008 Mumbai attacks|Mumbai attacks]] in [[India]] that occurred in November 2008.<ref>{{cite news|http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/19/2469096.htm|title=Obama security team 'prepared for unthinkable'|date=2009-01-19|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting News]]|accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref>  Attention was heightened by terrorist threats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/magazine/17Terror-t.html?ref=magazine|title=Obama<U+2019>s War Over Terror |author=Baker, Peter|accessdate=2010-01-18|date=2009-01-04|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

No one from the crowds at the swearing-in ceremony or parade was arrested on Inauguration Day.

More than a dozen counter-sniper teams were stationed along the inauguration parade route in response, and the criminal records of nearby employees and hotel guests were scrutinized, but no such attack took place. Kessler also reported a number of perceived inadequacies in the security during the inauguration, including an instance in which more than 100 major campaign donors and VIPs were able to board "secure" buses without being checked.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Harnden |first=Toby |title=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2009-08-03 |title=Barack Obama faces 30 death threats a day, stretching US Secret Service |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/5967942/Barack-Obama-faces-30-death-threats-a-day-stretching-US-Secret-Service.html |accessdate=2009-08-09}}</ref>

The [[international community]] paid unprecedented attention to the inauguration of Barack Obama. Millions of people, including citizens of numerous countries around the world and American [[expatriate]]s living in those countries, watched the Obama inauguration live on television and on the Internet. In some countries, the Obama inauguration garnered as much viewership as the [[opening ceremony]] of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].<ref name=kdn>{{cite news |first=|last=|title= History made as Obama sworn in |url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/517048/-/u1bo54/-/index.html |work= [[Daily Nation]] |location=[[Kenya]] |date=2009-01-19 |accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref> 

Celebrations surrounding the inauguration, praise of the event's significance and congratulations to Obama on his inauguration were internationally diverse.

Leaders of some countries reserved enthusiasm for the Obama inauguration, with coverage of the inauguration even muted in some places. [[President of Cuba|Cuban President]] [[Ra<U+00FA>l Castro]], brother of former Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]], declared that "[Obama] looks like a good man, I hope he is lucky",<ref name=cubacongrats>{{cite news|url=http://www.topnews.in/raul-castro-calls-obama-good-man-wishes-him-luck-2113300|title=Raul Castro calls Obama "a good man", wishes him luck|date=2009-01-21|publisher=''TopNews Magazine'' (India)|accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref> while [[Ricardo Alarc<U+00F3>n]], president of the [[National Assembly of People's Power|Cuban legislature]], admitted in his comments about Obama that "the incoming [U.S.] president 'is a big question mark.'"<ref name=cubacongrats/> [[Foreign Minister of Iran|Iranian Foreign Minister]] [[Manouchehr Mottaki]] expressed hope for openness for a new direction, noting that "if Obama chooses the right path, compensates the past, lifts hostility and U.S.&nbsp;hegemony, and revises the previous political mistakes, we will have no hostility."<ref name="WLACoOI"/> State-owned [[Channel One Russia]], [[Russia]]'s flagship early evening news show, covered Obama's presidential inauguration as a minor news story, devoting much of the day's airtime instead to the gas war with Ukraine.<ref name=WwOi>{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117998807.html?categoryid=1064&cs=1|title=World watches Obama inauguration: International audiences have mixed views|accessdate=2009-03-11|date=2009-01-20|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|author=Thomas, Archie}}</ref> The [[People's Republic of China]] covered the Obama inauguration live on its state<U+2011>controlled [[China Central Television]], providing simultaneous translation into [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]] with a brief delay to allow [[Censorship in the People's Republic of China|censoring]] of Obama's comments.

Ordinary citizens in [[Iraq]] even offered comments about the new president with cautious optimism. One Iraqi citizen opined that "If [Obama] can do as well as he talks, then all our problems are over", adding a belief that "[Obama] is a good man, but many people in Iraq believe all American presidents are the same and that we are a playground for their interests."<ref name=iraqview>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/20/obama-inauguration-global-reaction|title=Jubilation and resignation as world reacts to arrival of new US president|last=Dehghan|first=Saeed Kamali|coauthors=Rice, Xan; Harding, Luke; Chulov, Martin; Carroll, Rory  and McCarthy, Rory |date=2009-01-21|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=[[United Kingdom]]|accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref> Another citizen noted that "Obama won't get the same treatment,'&nbsp;...
