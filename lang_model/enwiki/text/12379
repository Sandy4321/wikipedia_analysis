'''Edward Goldenberg Robinson, Sr.''' (born '''Emanuel Goldenberg'''; {{lang-yi|<U+05E2><U+05DE><U+05E0><U+05D5><U+05D0><U+05DC> <U+05D2><U+05D0><U+05B8><U+05DC><U+05D3><U+05E0><U+05D1><U+05E2><U+05E8><U+05D2>}}; December 12, 1893 &ndash; January 26, 1973) was an [[United States|American]] [[actor]] born in [[Romania]]. Although he has played a wide range of characters, he is best remembered for his roles as a gangster, most notably in his star-making film ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]''.<ref name="obit"/>

==Birth and education==
Born to a [[Yiddish]]-speaking [[Jew]]ish family in [[Bucharest]], he emigrated with his family to [[New York City]] in 1903. He had his [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] at [[First Roumanian-American congregation]],<ref name=Epstein2007p249>[[#refEpstein2007|Epstein (2007)]], p. 249.</ref> and attended [[Townsend Harris High School]] and then [[City College of New York]]. An interest in acting led to him winning an [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] scholarship, after which he changed his name to ''Edward G. Robinson'' (the G. signifying his original [[Family name|last name]]).{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

== Career ==
He began his acting career in 1913 and made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in 1915. He made his film debut in a minor and uncredited role in [[1916 in film|1916]]; in [[1923 in film|1923]] he made his named debut as ''E. G. Robinson'' in ''The Bright Shawl''. One of many actors who saw his career flourish in the new [[sound film]] era rather than falter, he made only three films prior to 1930 but left his stage career that year and made 14 films in 1930-32. 

An acclaimed performance as the gangster Rico Bandello in ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' ([[1931 in film|1931]]) led to him being typecast as a "tough guy" for much of his early career in works such as ''[[Five Star Final]]'' (1931), ''[[Smart Money (film)|Smart Money]]'' (1931; his only movie with [[James Cagney]]), ''Tiger Shark'' (1932), ''[[Kid Galahad (1937 film)|Kid Galahad]]'' (1937) with [[Bette Davis]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]], and ''A Slight Case of Murder'' and ''[[The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse]]'' (1938). In the 1940s, he expanded into psychological dramas including ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944), ''[[The Woman in the Window]]'' (1945) and ''[[Scarlet Street]]'' (1945); but he continued to portray gangsters such as Johnny Rocco in [[John Huston]]'s ''[[Key Largo (film)|Key Largo]]'' (1948), the last of five films he made with [[Humphrey Bogart]]. 

After a hiatus, Robinson returned to the screen in [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s 1956 [[Bible|Biblical]] epic, ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'', in which he played [[Dathan]]. Afterward, Robinson's most notable roles were in ''[[A Hole in the Head]]'' (1959) opposite [[Frank Sinatra]] and ''[[The Cincinnati Kid]]'' (1965), which showcased Robinson alongside [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]]. Director [[Peter Bogdanovich]] was considered as a possible director for ''[[The Godfather]]'' in 1972, but turned it down, later remarking that he would have cast Robinson in the role ultimately played by [[Marlon Brando]].  Robinson indeed tried to talk his way into the part (which was how he had won the role of ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' 40 years earlier), but [[Francis Coppola]] decided on Brando instead, over the initial objections of the studio.  

Robinson was popular in the 1930s and 1940s and was able to avoid many flops during a 50-year career that included 101 films.  His last scene was a [[euthanasia]] sequence in the [[science fiction]] [[Cult following|cult film]] ''[[Soylent Green]]'' (1973) in which he dies in a euthanasia clinic while watching nature films on a wall-sized screen.

Robinson was never nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], but in 1973 he was awarded an [[Academy Honorary Award|honorary Oscar]] in recognition that he had "achieved greatness as a player, a patron of the arts, and a dedicated citizen ... in sum, a Renaissance man".<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000064/awards] Awards for Edward G. Robinson at the International Movie Database</ref> He died from [[cancer]] at the age of 79, two months before the award ceremony.<ref name="obit">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Edward G.

Edward G. Robinson is buried in a crypt in the family mausoleum at Beth-El Cemetery in [[Ridgewood, Queens|Ridgewood, New York]]. 

==Personal life==
Robinson married his first wife, stage actress Gladys Lloyd, in 1927; born Gladys Lloyd Cassell, she was the former wife of Ralph L. Vestervelt and the daughter of Clement C. Cassell, an architect, sculptor, and artist. The couple had one son, Edward Goldenberg Robinson, Jr. (a.k.a Manny Robinson, 1933-1974), as well as a daughter from Gladys Robinson's first marriage.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Edward G.

His death was attributed to natural causes. |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=1974-02-27, Wednesday |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}</ref>

On three occasions in 1950 and 1952, he was called to testify in front of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] and was threatened with [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisting]].<ref>Sabin, Arthur J. ''In Calmer Times: The Supreme Court and Red Monday'', p. 35. Philadelphia: [[University of Pennsylvania]] Press, 1999.</ref> Robinson took steps to clear his name, such as having a representative go through his check stubs to ensure that none had been issued to subversive organizations.<ref>''ibid.''; Bud and Ruth Schultz, ''It Did Happen Here: Recollections of Political Repression in America'', p. 113. Berkeley: [[University of California Press]], 1989.</ref> He also gave names of [[Communist]] sympathizers and his own name was cleared, but thereafter he received smaller and less frequent roles. Still, [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] cast him in ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' in 1956.

Robinson built up a significant [[Collection (museum)|art collection]], especially of abstract modern art.  In 1956, he sold it to [[Greece|Greek]] shipping tycoon [[Stavros Niarchos]] to raise cash for his divorce settlement with Gladys Robinson; his finances had suffered due to underemployment in the early 1950s.

==Legacy and tributes==
*A character bearing his likeness, an earlier version of the gangster character [[Rocky and Mugsy|Rocky]], was featured in the [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoon ''[[Racketeer Rabbit]]'' (in that cartoon, Robinson was paired with a [[Peter Lorre]] caricature). His likeness also appeared in ''The CooCooNut Grove'', ''[[Thugs with Dirty Mugs]]'' and ''Hush My Mouse''.  Another character based on Robinson's gangster image was The Frog from the cartoon series ''[[Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse]]''.

*In Robinson's final film, ''[[Soylent Green]]'', he plays a depressed and disillusioned man who commits suicide to escape from the apocalyptic future world in which he lives; his death scene features him speaking with co-star [[Charlton Heston]] whose character weeps silently as he sees Robinson's videos of a pre-destroyed Earth. The tears were real; Heston was at that time the only one who knew of Robinson's terminal cancer. 

* The voice of ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' character police chief [[Chief Wiggum|Clancy Wiggum]] is based on Robinson.
