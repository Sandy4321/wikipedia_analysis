'''The Confederation of British Industry''' (CBI) was formed in [[1965]] as a [[pressure group]] and a [[lobbying]] organisation for British business owners. Officially neutral in party-politics, the CBI lobbies actively for the reduction of taxes and regulation on business and the curtailment of pay and conditions for workers. Its forerunner was the '''Federation of British Industries''', established in 1916.

== Membership ==

Approximately 80% of the [[FTSE 100]] and nearly half of the FTSE 350 are members of the '''CBI'''.

Most of its larger members and many of the medium-sized and smaller ones operate internationally.

Membership of the CBI is corporate: organisations and companies are members, not the individuals nominated to represent them.

== Lobbying ==
The CBI is able to lobby democratically elected representatives in order to gain concessions deemed favourable to the owners of UK businesses.

== Research ==
The CBI conducts numerous surveys and reports which are of particular use to its members. Research conducted is available to the relevant sections of its membership.
