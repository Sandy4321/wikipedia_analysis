'''St Edmund Hall''' is one of the [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|constituent colleges]] of the [[University of Oxford]] in [[England]].  Better known within the University by its nickname, "'''Teddy Hall'''", the college has a claim to being "the oldest academical society for the education of undergraduates in any university".<ref>Cowdrey (1988); p. 388, referencing A.B. Emden who in his 1927 (p. 236) work states: "...and St Edmund Hall now survives as the last lineal descendent of the oldest form of academical society designed for the residence of scholars studying in the Oxford Schools."
</ref> As of 2007 St Edmund Hall had an estimated [[financial endowment]] of <U+00A3>39m.<ref>St Edmund Hall (2007) [http://www.seh.ox.ac.uk/index.php?section=353 ''The College: Published Accounts'']</ref>  

== History ==
Like the [[University of Oxford]] itself, the precise date of establishment of St Edmund Hall is unknown; it is usually estimated at 1278.<ref name=a1278/> The college is named after [[Edmund Rich|St Edmund]] of [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire]], the first known Oxford [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|Master of Arts]] and the first Oxford-educated [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who lived and taught on the college site.

St Edmund Hall began life as one of Oxford's ancient [[Aularian house]]s, the mediaeval halls that laid the foundation of the University, preceding the creation of the first colleges.  As the only surviving mediaeval hall, its members are known as "[[Aularian]]s".  St Edmund Hall took on the status of a college in 1957, though retaining the historical moniker of "Hall". 

The college has a history of independent thought, which has brought it into regular conflict with both church and state.  During the late 14th century and early 15th century, it was a bastion of the [[John Wycliffe|Wycliffe]] heresy, for which college principal [[William Taylor (Lollard)|William Taylor]] was ultimately burnt at the stake, and principal [[Peter Payne]] fled the country.  In the 17th century, it incurred the wrath of the crown for fostering [[nonjuring schism|nonjurors]], men who remained loyal to the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[House of Stuart]] and who refused to take the oath to the [[Germany|German]] [[House of Hanover]], whom they regarded as having usurped the [[British throne]].

== College colours ==
Like most academic institutions, Oxbridge colleges commonly have a colour scheme used for college scarves, ties, sports clothing and so on. There is a great deal of confusion regarding the Hall's official college colours which seems to have arisen due to a discrepancy between "official college wear" and sporting wear. 

The college's official colours are "claret and cream"; while this is not stated explicitly anywhere on the college's official web-site, the "[http://www.seh.ox.ac.uk/index.php?section=19 College memorabilia]" section quotes these as the colours of official college merchandise, such as the [[Oxbridge Scarf Colours|college scarves]].

In the vast majority of sporting wear produced the "claret and cream" are often substituted by maroon and gold. This has naturally led to many people incorrectly assuming that these are the college colours. Confusion may also be caused by the fact that the college's [[coat of arms]] has a yellow/gold field.

== Coat of Arms ==
[[Image:SEHCrest.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Coat of Arms of St Edmund Hall, Oxford. This sculpture is found above the entrance to the [[Porters' Lodge]].]]

The College Coat of Arms depicts a red cross fleury against a yellow/gold field surrounded by four [[Chough|Cornish Choughs]] and is blazoned "''Or, a cross fleury gules between four Cornish choughs perched proper''".

In the image shown to the left, the College coat of arms is found above the following Latin dedication "''sanctus edmundus huius aulae lux''" which can be loosely translated as "''St Edmund, light of this Hall''". 

It is a very common practice within the University to use [[chronogram]]s for dedications - when transcribed into Latin, they are written in such a way that an important date, usually that of a foundation or the dedication itself, is embedded in the text. This is usually achieved by choosing certain letters in the text which correspond to [[Roman Numerals]] which when added, often disregarding the usual [[subtractive notation]], amount to the required date. These numerals are then indicated by being rendered in a larger size than that of the surrounding letters. 

In the above dedication, the text is rendered as <div style="font-variant:small-caps;">sanCtVs edMVndVs hVIVs aVLae LVX</div> and, in this case, adding the numerals naively gives:

:C + V + M + V + V + V + I + V + V + L + L + V + X = 1246

which is a popular, if conservative, estimate for the establishment of the Hall, but is in fact the date of the canonisation of St Edmund of Abingdon.

== Locations and buildings ==
St Edmund Hall is based on a small central site on the north side of the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]]. The front quadrangle (see picture) is bordered by the [[porters' lodge]], the old dining hall (1659), the college bar and buttery (containing a mid-15th-century fireplace), the chapel with the old library above (late 17th century), and accommodation for students and fellows. In the centre of the quadrangle is a medieval well. Passages from the quadrangle give access to modern accommodation blocks and dining hall to the east, and the college library (the deconsecrated church of St Peter in the East, 12th century) and gardens (St Peter's churchyard) to the north. The garden contains a seated bronze depicting St Edmund as an impoverished student. The college also owns annexes at [[Norham Gardens]], on [[Dawson Street, Oxford|Dawson Street]], and on [[Iffley Road]].

== Student life ==
The student body has long been known for prowess in [[sport]], especially [[Rugby football|rugby]]. In Hilary Term of 2008, the college made it to the finals of both the football and rugby cuppers competitions, winning in the rugby final against Keble college. More recently, it has also demonstrated strengths in [[journalism]], [[drama]], [[mathematics]] and [[student politics]]. In 2007 the college fielded a team in [[University Challenge]] scoring one of the three highest scores in the first round.

== College assets and artifacts ==

== College graces ==
The usual college grace given before [[Formal Hall]] is ''Benedictus, Benedicat per Jesum Christum Dominum Nostrum'' (Blessed is He and Blessed is this (food) through Jesus Christ Our Lord) to which the assembly responds ''Amen''. More extended forms of the grace are sometimes given but this is very rare.
