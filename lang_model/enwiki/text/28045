'''Innocent Anyanwu''' (born 25 September 1982) is a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] professional boxer from [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. He currently holds the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[BeNeLux]] [[Super Featherweight]] titles.

==Biography==
Innocent has a remarkable life story. He was born in [[Ekwerazu]], [[Imo State]], [[Nigeria]].
When he was 12 his mother died and Innocent quit school. Shortly thereafter he started to work as a carmechanic in his brother's garage. However he had a dream to practise sports in [[Germany]], even though he did not knew which sport.
He left [[Nigeria]] when he was 16 and went to [[Cameroon]] without a [[passport]] because he did not have one. Once in Cameroon (a [[French language|French]]-speaking country), the language barrier proved a problem. Still, after that he went to another French speaking country, [[Gabon]], where a brother of his was living.
Through [[Germans|German]] tourists he learned that he needed several visas in order to compete in sports there. Because he did not even have a passport, he never tried to head to Germany.

==Boxing career==

Innocent started his [[boxing]] career in [[Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]] in 2001. After promising his trainer Martin Jansen total dedication to the sport, an intense training regime started and the cooperation continued until today. After three months Innocent participated in his first boxing match which he won. The victory parade of Innocent continued through the amateur ranks in national and international boxing matches in The Netherlands. Innocent fought against boxers from not only the Netherlands but also from [[Belgium]], [[Russia]] and [[Germany]]. With only 3 losses (early in his boxing career) in 36 contests, and many wins by (T)KO, Innocent wanted to represent the Netherlands at the [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympics]] in [[Athens]] but was denied because he did not hold [[Dutch people|Dutch]] nationality. Innocent then went back to his native country [[Nigeria]] where he captured the national amateur title and Champion of Champions trophy at super-featherweight. That enabled Innocent to return to the Netherlands and reunite in 2005 with his long time boxing trainer Martin Jansen to continue his professional boxing career. 
 
In 2005, Innocent made his pro debut. He fought 20 times up to October 2009 in and outside the Netherlands and never lost a fight. He captured the Dutch national and smaller European (BeNeLux) crown. Innocent's goal is to support his people in Ekwerazu, Nigeria through his boxing career. His results as a sportsman and social human being were awarded by the Dutch Queen with a Dutch passport (with a radio chip and coil), which enables him to participate on short notice in a [[Europe]]an championship fight.
 
Innocent is ranked in September 2009 as the no. 1 with the ABU ([[African]] Boxing Union), the no. 40 with the WBC ([[World Boxing Council]]) and in Europe (EBU/EU and EBA) ranked as an official challenger for the European crown.

From the start of 2010 Martin Jansen stopped working as the trainer for Innocent, but Raymond Joval stepped in as the new trainer.
