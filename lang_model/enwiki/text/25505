The '''2010 New Year's Eve tornado outbreak''' was a three-day long [[tornado outbreak]] that impacted the central and lower [[Mississippi Valley]] from December&nbsp;30, 2010 to January&nbsp;1, 2011. Associated with a [[low-pressure area|low pressure system]] and a strong [[cold front]], 37&nbsp;tornadoes tracked across five states over the length of the severe event, killing nine and injuring several others. Activity was centered in the states of [[Missouri]] and later [[Mississippi]] on December&nbsp;31. Seven tornadoes were rated EF3 on the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]]; these were the strongest during the outbreak. Non-tornadic winds were recorded to have reached as high as 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) at eight locations on December&nbsp;31, while hail as large as 2.75&nbsp;in (7.0&nbsp;cm) was documented north-northeast of [[Mansfield, Missouri]]. Overall, damage from the outbreak totaled [[United States dollar|US$]]123.3&nbsp;million, most of which was related to tornadoes.<ref name=StormEventsTornadoes>{{cite web|title=Flash Flood, Flood, Hail, Heavy Rain, Thunderstorm Wind, and Tornado Events From December 30, 2010 to January 1, 2011|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/listevents.jsp?eventType=%28C%29+Flash+Flood&eventType=%28Z%29+Flood&eventType=%28C%29+Hail&eventType=%28C%29+Heavy+Rain&eventType=%28C%29+Thunderstorm+Wind&eventType=%28C%29+Tornado&beginDate_mm=12&beginDate_dd=30&beginDate_yyyy=2010&endDate_mm=01&endDate_dd=02&endDate_yyyy=2011&hailfilter=0.00&tornfilter=0&windfilter=000&sort=DT&submitbutton=Search&statefips=-999%2CALL#|website=National Climatic Data Center|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=February 14, 2015|location=Asheville, North Carolina}}</ref>

The United States [[Storm Prediction Center]] first noted a possible New Year's Eve severe weather event as early as [[Christmas|December&nbsp;25, 2010]]. These forecasts gained confidence as the event approached, with a focus on the [[Ozarks]] and adjacent areas. [[Supercell]]s developed in this area during the night of December&nbsp;30 and tracked across central [[Missouri]], producing several tornadoes and large hail. However, the bulk of activity during the outbreak was a result of a long line of supercells that tracked from [[Oklahoma]] to [[Illinois]], producing five EF3&nbsp;tornadoes. One of these tracked through northwestern Arkansas, killing four. Another tore through eastern sections of [[Fort Leonard Wood]] in Missouri, destroying 159&nbsp;homes and causing US$90&nbsp;million in damage, making it the costliest tornado of the outbreak. A separate cluster of storms later developed in [[Louisiana]] before tracking into Mississippi, producing several tornadoes across southern and central regions of the state on January&nbsp;1.

The [[Storm Prediction Center]]&nbsp;<small>(SPC)</small> began to note the possibility that a severe weather event could develop on December&nbsp;30 as early as December&nbsp;25, 2010.

[[File:31 Dec 2010 Cincinnati tornado damage.jpg|thumb|right|Damage in Cincinnati, Arkansas]] 
The deadliest tornado of the 2010 New Year's Eve tornado outbreak moved across extreme eastern Oklahoma and northwestern Arkansas, tracking {{convert|21.1|mi|km|abbr=on}} and damaging the unincorporated community of [[Cincinnati, Arkansas]].<ref name=SD2010 /> The first [[tornado warning]] associated was issued at 12:00&nbsp;UTC for portions of Adair County in Oklahoma and Benton and Washington counties in Arkansas by the [[National Weather Service Tulsa, Oklahoma]].<ref name=TornadoWarningCincinnati>{{cite web|last1=Lacy|first1=Michael|title=Tornado Warning 600 AM CST Fri Dec 31 2010|url=http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/vtec/#2010-O-NEW-KTSA-TO-W-0042/USCOMP-N0Q-201012311210|website=VTEC Browser|publisher=Iowa Environmental Mesonet|accessdate=February 7, 2015|location=Tulsa, Oklahoma|date=December 31, 2010}}</ref> At around the same time, damaging winds estimated at around {{convert|70|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} tore the roof off of a barn southwest of [[Westville, Oklahoma]]; these winds were likely a result of [[inflow (meteorology)|inflow]] caused by the developing tornado.<ref name=Toolkit>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service Damage Assessment Toolkit|url=http://54.243.139.84/StormDamage/DamageViewer/|website=National Weather Service|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=February 7, 2015}}</ref> Post-tornado survey teams concluded that the tornado touched down five minutes later northeast of Westville.<ref name=TSAsummary>{{cite web|author1=Tulsa, Oklahoma Weather Forecast Office|title=Event Summary&nbsp;<U+2013> December 30-31, 2010 Severe Thunderstorms/Tornadoes|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/tsa/?n=weather_event_30dec2010|website=National Weather Service|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=February 7, 2015|location=Tulsa, Oklahoma|date=April 18, 2014}}</ref> Quickly tracking northeast, the tornado snapped 13&nbsp;large wooden utility poles. Four cars were displaced by {{convert|20|-|50|yd|m|abbr=on}} and a nearby home sustained significant roof damage and broken windows; this resulted in an EF2&nbsp;rating for the tornado within Adair County.<ref name=Toolkit /> Damage in Adair County totaled $60,000. At 12:08&nbsp;UTC, the tornado crossed the Oklahoma-Arkansas border and moved into Benton County, Arkansas.<ref name=SD2010 />

At 12:10&nbsp;UTC, the tornado tracked into Cincinnati, Arkansas, where it reached its peak intensity. Winds were estimated as high as {{convert|142|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and the tornado widened to a width of {{convert|300|yd|m|abbr=on}}, making the tornado an EF3&nbsp;at this location.<ref name=Toolkit /><ref name=TSAsummary /> Several homes were destroyed or heavily damaged in the southwestern areas of the town. Numerous trees and power poles were knocked down or uprooted. Two people were killed when a mobile home was destroyed, while another person died as he was tending cattle when the barn he occupied collapsed. Seven others were injured in Cincinnati. The tornado continued to widen as it trekked northeastward, reaching a maximum width of {{convert|500|yd|m|abbr=on}}. Several permanent homes were heavily damaged northeast of Cincinnati, and a number of [[chicken house]]s, mobile homes, outbuildings, and power poles were destroyed. One woman was critically injured after her mobile home was destroyed; she died of her injuries at a hospital four days later.<ref name=TSAsummary /> Damage in Cincinnati and surrounding areas within Benton County reached $1.5&nbsp;million.<ref name=SD2010 />

After 12:17&nbsp;UTC, the tornado's position fluctuated between Benton and Washington counties in northwestern Arkansas. Permanent houses were damaged and mobile homes were destroyed. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped while many other power poles were snapped. Two people were injured following the destruction of a mobile home within the [[Ozark National Forest]] in Benton County, while another person was injured west of [[Tontitown, Arkansas]] in Washington County.<ref name=TSAsummary /> The tornado finally dissipated northwest of Tontitown at 12:27&nbsp;UTC after causing four deaths and ten injuries.<ref name=SD2010 /><ref name=TSAsummary /> Overall, the tornado caused $1.835&nbsp;million in damage, which was the sixth costliest total during the tornado outbreak.<ref name=SD2010 />

===Fenton<U+2013>Sunset Hills, Missouri tornado===
At 17:22&nbsp;UTC on December&nbsp;31, the [[National Weather Service St. Louis, Missouri]] issued a tornado warning for a severe [[squall line]] capable of producing rain-wrapped tornadoes and wind damage. The warning covered ten counties in Missouri and Illinois straddling the [[Mississippi River]] and included [[St. Louis]].<ref name=TornadoWarningStLouis>{{cite web|last1=King|first1=C.V.|title=Tornado Warning 1122 AM CST Fri Dec 31 2010|url=http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/vtec/#2010-O-NEW-KLSX-TO-W-0086/USCOMP-N0Q-201012311725|website=VTEC Browser|publisher=Iowa Environmental Mesonet|accessdate=February 9, 2015|location=St. Louis, Missouri|date=December 31, 2010}}</ref> Shortly after the warning's issuance, two EF1&nbsp;tornadoes tracked across Jefferson and St. Louis counties, causing extensive tree damage and minor property damage. However, the most destructive tornado from the passing squall line touched down at 17:48&nbsp;UTC east-northeast of [[Murphy, Missouri]] in northern Jefferson County. Initially, the tornado was an EF0 with a path width of {{convert|40|yd|m|abbr=on}} and lifted before touching down again just north of [[Missouri Route 30]] near the Jefferson-St. Louis county line. Small trees and minor roof damage occurred at the point of this second touch down before the tornado moved northeastward into St. Louis County, where the tornado caused a bulk of its damage and was at its strongest.<ref name=SD2010 />

A large subdivision near Route&nbsp;30 sustained minor roof and tree damage, which was rated as EF0&nbsp;intensity. However, as the tornado was intensifying through the neighborhood, three homes to the subdivision's east suffered more considerable roof and siding damage and was assigned an EF1&nbsp;damage intensity rating. The tornado then crossed [[Missouri Route 141]], where it blew a [[Honda CR-V]] into a highway barrier; the driver of the vehicle suffered critical injuries and died eleven days later from those injuries. After crossing the highway, a number of buildings were damaged including a church, elementary school, and [[parsonage]]. Damage in this area was rated as EF2 due to the partial debarking of a nearby tree. Minor tree damage occurred as the tornado moved through [[Fenton, Missouri|Fenton Park]] and tracked over the [[Meramec River]].<ref name=SD2010 />

After crossing the river, the tornado weakened to EF1&nbsp;strength, damaging several homes while also leaving behind an interrupted damage path. The tornado crossed [[Interstate 270 (Illinois<U+2013>Mississippi)|Interstate 270]] before rapidly intensifying at around 17:56&nbsp;UTC. Numerous trees were uprooted while many homes sustained considerable damage. Six homes were unroofed and one was destroyed and shifted from its foundation; this damage was rated high-end EF3. At the time, the tornado was {{convert|0.25|mi|km|abbr=on}} wide. The tornado weakened to EF1&nbsp;intensity afterwards, causing more minor damage to a strip mall and several homes. Six power poles were knocked down shortly before the tornado lifted at 18:00&nbsp;UTC in western [[Crestwood, Missouri]].<ref name=SD2010 />

==Non-tornadic impacts==
Beginning on December&nbsp;29 and continuing for three days, the storm system associated with the tornado outbreak caused strong winds across the [[Texas Panhandle]] and eastern [[New Mexico]]. The winds were further enhanced by isolated showers, and gusts peaked at 79&nbsp;mph (127&nbsp;km/h) in [[Tatum, New Mexico]]. Approximately 7&nbsp;mi (11&nbsp;km) west of [[Levelland, Texas]], the winds downed four power poles, sparking a fire that burned nearly 2,000&nbsp;acres (800&nbsp;hectares) of grassland before it was finally contained;<ref name=LUBsummary>{{cite web|author1=Lubbock, Texas Weather Forecast Office|title=Strong winds sweep across the South Plains, 30 December 2010|url=http://www.srh.weather.gov/lub/?n=events-2010-20101230|website=National Weather Service|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=February 14, 2015|location=Lubbock, Texas|date=January 2, 2011}}</ref> the fire caused US$20,000&nbsp;in damage.<ref name=LevellandTX-TSTMWind-1230-1919>{{cite web|author1=Lubbock, Texas Weather Forecast Office|title=Storm Event Report for Thunderstorm Wind Near Levelland, Texas|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=266371|website=National Climatic Data Center|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=February 14, 2015|location=Lubbock, Texas|date=December 30, 2010}}</ref> In [[Allen, Oklahoma]], strong winds associated with one supercell caused an estimated US$20,000 in damage after damaging the carport, chimney, and roof of a house.<ref name=AllenOK-TSTMWind-1230-0335>{{cite web|author1=Tulsa, Oklahoma Weather Forecast Office|title=Storm Event Report for Thunderstorm Wind Near Allen, Oklahoma|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=274086|website=National Climatic Data Center|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=February 16, 2015|location=Tulsa, Oklahoma|date=December 30, 2010}}</ref> Hail and strong winds were also reported elsewhere in eastern Oklahoma and southeastern [[Kansas]]. Widespread and damaging wind gusts and hail later crossed into northwestern Arkansas, causing US$175,000&nbsp;in damage. Several buildings and homes were destroyed by the strong winds; similar impacts were seen in Missouri and Illinois.<ref name=SD2010 />

In [[Mississippi]], rainfall totals between {{convert|1|<U+2013>|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} were widespread. The highest precipitation total was {{convert|5.58|in|mm|abbr=on}} south of [[Grace, Mississippi]].<ref name=JANsummary /> In [[Scott County, Oklahoma|Scott County]], residents were forced to evacuate out of [[Forest, Mississippi|Forest]] and [[Morton, Mississippi|Morton]] due to flash floods that caused $470,000&nbsp;in damage. Similarly, the inundation washed out roads and flooded cars in [[Winona, Mississippi|Winona]]. Overall, flood damage in Mississippi amounted to US$1.135&nbsp;million.<ref name=SD2010 />
