'''Hurricane Danny''' was the only [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]] to make [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in the [[United States]] during the [[1997 Atlantic hurricane season]], and the second hurricane and fourth tropical storm of the season. The system became the earliest 5th tropical or [[Subtropical cyclone|subtropical]] storm of the Atlantic season when it reached [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|tropical storm strength]] on [[July 17]], and held that record until the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]] when [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Tropical Storm Emily]] broke that record by several days. Like the previous four tropical or [[Subtropical cyclone|subtropical]] [[cyclones]] of the season, Danny had a non-tropical origin, after a trough spawned convection that entered the warm waters of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Danny had an extended northeast track through the Gulf of Mexico, caused by two [[high pressure area|high pressure systems]], a rare occurrence in the middle of July. The storm moved across the [[Southeastern United States|southeastern]] United States, after making landfall in the [[Gulf Coast]], and impacted parts of Massachusetts with rain and [[wind]].

Danny is noted for the extreme [[rainfall]], [[tornadoes]], and [[natural disaster|damage]] it produced on its path, causing four direct fatalities and $100&nbsp;million (1997&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]], $128&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD) in damage. The storm dropped a record amount of rainfall for Alabama, at least 36.71&nbsp;inches (932&nbsp;mm) on [[Dauphin Island]]. Flooding, power outages, and erosion occurred in many areas of the [[Gulf Coast]], and rescues from flooded roads had to be performed. Various tornadoes on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] caused a great amount of damage. Danny caused one death off the coast of [[Alabama]], four deaths in [[Georgia]], two deaths in [[South Carolina]], and two deaths in [[North Carolina]].

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Danny 1997 track.png}}
A broad [[troposphere|mid-tropospheric]] [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] over the southeastern United States spawned an area of [[convection]] over the lower [[Mississippi River Valley]] on [[July 13]], and drifted southward towards the warm [[Sea surface temperature|waters]] of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As it moved into the Gulf of Mexico, a weak and isolated surface [[low pressure area]] formed off of the coast of [[Louisiana]]. The [[Atmospheric circulation|circulation]] in the system steadily expanded, and initially the surface winds and convection were intermittent. On [[July 16]], deep convection increased and organized near the center, and [[oil rigs]] and [[buoy|surface buoys]] reported surface winds of 30&nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (50&nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]). Based on the observations, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Four on [[July 16]] while about 150&nbsp;[[mile]]s (240&nbsp;[[kilometer|km]]) south of the southwestern Louisiana coastline.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Richard J. Pasch|year=1998|title=Hurricane Danny Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2006-12-28|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1997danny.html}}</ref>

[[Image:Hurricanedanny09181997.JPG|200px|thumb|right|Hurricane Danny seen after passing over Southeastern Louisiana]]
The depression slowly organized for the next day, as it drifted to the northeast. On [[July 17]], the rate of organization and development of deep convection increased considerably, and the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Danny later that day. From the night of [[July 17]] through [[July 18]], Danny quickly developed deep [[convection]] and banding features in the favorable environment of the Gulf of Mexico, and reached hurricane status later on [[July 18]]. Located between two high pressure systems, Danny continued its unusual July track to the northeast, and crossed over southeastern Louisiana near the [[Mississippi River Delta]]. A small storm, Danny continued to strengthen after reaching the coastal waters off [[Mississippi]] on the night of the [[July 18]], and attained a peak of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) early on [[July 19]]. The hurricane force winds, however, were secluded to the [[eyewall]]. After stalling near the mouth of [[Mobile Bay]] on [[July 19]], Hurricane Danny turned to the east, and made its final landfall near [[Baldwin County|Mullet Point, Alabama]] later that day.<ref name="tcr"/>

The storm rapidly weakened as it continued northward, and degenerated into a tropical depression by [[July 20]]. The weak depression moved through [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[South Carolina]], and [[North Carolina]], maintaining a well-defined [[cloud]] signature.<ref name="tcr"/> Due to a [[Surface weather analysis|front]] behind the system, Danny strengthened baroclinically over North Carolina to a tropical storm on [[July 24]]. This is quite rare for a [[tropical cyclone]], but it occurred due to interaction with a developing trough and its associated barolinic zone.<ref name="tcr"/><ref name="extropclimate">{{cite web|author=Robert E. Hart and Jenni L. Evans|year=1999/2000|title=A Climatology of the Extratropical Transition of Atlantic Tropical Cyclones|publisher=[[Journal of Climate]]|accessdate=2007-12-14|url=http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0442/14/4/pdf/i1520-0442-14-4-546.pdf}}</ref> 
Danny entered the [[Atlantic Ocean]], north of the [[North Carolina]]-[[Virginia]] border, near [[Virginia Beach]]. It quickly reached a secondary peak of 60&nbsp;mph (96&nbsp;km/h), and continued rapidly northeastward towards the waters of the Atlantic. A strong mid to upper-level cyclone turned Danny northward, threatening [[Massachusetts]]. It stalled while just 30&nbsp;miles (48&nbsp;km) southeast of [[Nantucket, Massachusetts|Nantucket]] on [[July 26]], turned to the east out to sea, and became [[Extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] later that day. On [[July 27]], the former hurricane merged with a [[Surface weather analysis|frontal zone]].<ref name="tcr"/>

==Preparations==
[[Image:1997DannyNOLARadar.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Hurricane Danny just offshore of the Gulf Coast]]
The [[National Hurricane Center]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watch]] on [[July 17]], as Danny strengthened to a tropical storm, for the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.  When Danny strengthened to a hurricane on [[July 18]], a few hours before its landfall in far southeastern Louisiana, over a day before landfall in [[Alabama]], and the hurricane watch became upgraded to a hurricane warning.<ref name="tcr"/> [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]] mayor [[Arthur Ballenger]] ordered the [[Emergency evacuation|evacuation]] of the town's 1,500 residents, a decision made due to the large number of tourists on the island and to prevent anyone being unable to leave the island. With a 5&nbsp;foot (1.5&nbsp;meter) storm surge possibility, it could potentially flood the only highway out of the island. Officials distributed [[sandbags]] to residents in [[St. Bernard Parish]] to seal off roads easily flooded, with officials recommending that residents leave the area.<ref name="cnn91897">{{cite web|author=Valerie Voss, Charles Zewe, Reuters|year=1997|title=Hurricane Danny skims Louisiana tip, moves northeast|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=2006-12-28|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060617223342/http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9707/18/hurricane.danny/}} Accessed via the [[Wayback Machine]].</ref>

Prior to the arrival of the hurricane, the governors of [[Governor of Mississippi|Mississippi]] and [[Governor of Alabama|Alabama]] declared disaster emergencies, expecting a 9 foot storm surge and up to 20 inches of rain at that time. Six [[Emergency shelter|shelter]]s were opened in [[Mobile County]], though few attended. Officials also considered opening shelters near local casinos and beaches in [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], Mississippi.<ref name="cnn91997">{{cite web|author=Associated Press, Reuters|year=1997|title=Hurricane Danny heading for Alabama and Mississippi|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2006-12-29|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060620121555/http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9707/19/hurricane.danny.on/}} Accessed via the [[Wayback Machine]].</ref> 

Southeastern [[Massachusetts]] also had a tropical storm warning issued, a few hours before sustained tropical storm force winds affected the area and less than 12 hours before its closest approach to the coastline.<ref name="tcr"/>

==Impact==
[[Image:Danny-rainfall.gif|right|250px|thumb|Rainfall totals from Hurricane Danny]]
Being a small storm, Danny caused a damage toll of only $100&nbsp;million (1997&nbsp;USD, $128&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD). It caused a total of 4 direct and 5 indirect deaths.<ref name="tcr"/>

===Gulf Coast===
Heavy rain and winds impacted many [[Parish (country subdivision)|parishes]] located east of the city of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].<ref name="tcr"/><ref name="cnn91997"/> A small [[radius]] near the center of the storm had much of the extreme rainfall, and limited the flooding, which could have been disastrous if it were widespread.<ref name="tcr"/><ref name="NCDClouisiana">{{cite web|author=NCDC|year=1997|title=Event Record Details: Hurricane (Louisiana)|publisher=[[NCDC]]|accessdate=2007-01-01|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~296745}}</ref> Grand Isle and portions of the lower [[Plaquemines Parish]] were worst hit in Louisiana. Grand Isle reported a wind gust of 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) and a storm surge of 5.2&nbsp;feet (1.6&nbsp;meters). A gage reported a water level of 4.85&nbsp;feet (1.5&nbsp;meters) in [[Venice, Louisiana|Venice]]. Storm [[tides]] were 2 to 3&nbsp;feet (0.6 to 0.9&nbsp;meters) above normal on average.<ref name="NCDClouisiana"/>

At least 10,000 people lost electricity in Louisiana. Also, 130 [[boats]] were damaged or sunk at a large [[marina]] in [[Buras, Louisiana|Buras]], Louisiana, due to the storm surge of over 4 feet, in a matter of minuets.<ref name="cnn91997"/> Both [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]] and [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Grand Terre Island]] received erosion on their shores.<ref name="cnn92297">{{cite web|author=Charles Zewe, Associated Press|year=1997|title=Danny drifts north, leaving mayhem in its wake|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=2006-12-31|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050212093504/http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9707/22/danny.early/index.html}} Accessed via the [[Wayback Machine]].</ref> Around 160 [[household]]s and 80 [[business]]es reported damage on Grand Isle. [[Jefferson Parish]], on Grand Isle, had $1.5&nbsp;million (1997&nbsp;USD, $1.93&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD) total in damage. [[Plaquemines Parish]], on Grand Isle, had $3.5&nbsp;million (1997&nbsp;USD, $4.5&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD) in damage. [[Empire, Louisiana|Empire]] and [[Venice, Louisiana|Venice]] had the greatest damage in Plaquemines Parish. Within the hurricane protection levees in the parish, trees, power lines, house roofs, and mobile homes had damage inflicted, as well as the localized flooding that occurred in Plaquemines, after about 10 inches of rain. Some highways were flooded, due to storm tides, in lower [[Terrebonne Parish]], and a few [[roads]] in [[St. Bernard Parish|St. Bernard]] and [[Orleans Parish|Orleans]] parishes, which were outside the hurricane protection [[levees]]. Negligible damage occurred elsewhere in the extreme southeastern portion of Louisiana, due to Danny being a small tropical cyclone and a minimal hurricane.<ref name="NCDClouisiana"/>

Eastern [[Jackson County, Mississippi|Jackson County]] had the most impact throughout Mississippi. [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]] reported a wind gust of 35&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;km/h) on [[July 19]]. Pascagoula airport reported 7.87 inches (200&nbsp;mm) of rain from [[July 17]] through July 19. Some streets and a few homes were flooded in far southeastern Jackson County, in areas of poor drainage systems.  The coast of Mississippi had no significant damage according to emergency management officials.<ref name="NCDCmississippi">{{cite web|author=NCDC|year=1997|title=Event Record Details: Hurricane (Mississippi)|publisher=[[NCDC]]|accessdate=2007-01-01|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~299434}}</ref>

Extreme amounts of rainfall were produced over [[Alabama]].<ref name="tcr"/> Dauphin Island had the highest amount of rainfall, 37.75&nbsp;inches (959&nbsp;mm) reported by the [[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|HPC]].<ref name="HPCmap">{{cite web|author=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|year=1997|title=Hurricane Danny Rainfall Totals|publisher=[[NCDC]]|accessdate=2007-12-13|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/danny1997filledrainblk.gif}}</ref>  Dauphin Island Sea Lab recorded 36.71&nbsp;inches (932&nbsp;mm) of rain, but not all the rain may have recorded in the rain gauge at this location, so it is possible the rainfall may have been underestimated. [[Doppler radar]] estimates show that around 43&nbsp;inches (1,090&nbsp;mm) of rain fell off the coast of Dauphin Island. A storm surge of over 6.5&nbsp;feet (1.98&nbsp;[[Metre|m]]) occurred off of [[List of state highways in Alabama|Highway 182]], midway between [[Gulf Shores, Alabama|Gulf Shores]], and [[Fort Morgan, Alabama]], in addition to the rainfall. Unusually, when the storm stalled off the coast of Alabama, prevailing northerly winds forced the water out of [[Mobile Bay]], causing tides to be two&nbsp;feet (0.61&nbsp;m) below normal. Observers noted that, with the exception of river [[Channel (geography)|channels]], it would be possible to walk across the bay. In addition, three tornadoes occurred in Alabama, one being in [[Orange Beach, Alabama|Orange Beach]], another in [[Opelika, Alabama|Opelika]], while the other one occurred in [[Port Alabama]].<ref name="tcr"/> A couple of other tornadoes also caused minimal damage.<ref name="alabamatornadoes">{{cite web|author=NWS-Birmingham Internet Services Team|year=2006|title=NWS-Birmingham Internet Services Team|publisher=[[National Weather Service]]|accessdate=2006-12-31|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/bmx/tornadoes/1997.php}}</ref>

Despite its effects in the northern [[Gulf of Mexico]], only one person was directly killed from the storm there; a man [[drowning|drowned]] off the coast when he fell off his sailboat near [[Fort Morgan, Alabama|Fort Morgan]], Alabama. One indirect casualty also occurred in the area, when a man had a heart attack while trying to secure a boat off the Alabama coast during the storm.<ref name="tcr"/> Numerous roads became flooded and impassable for several days, south and along [[Interstate 10 in Alabama|I-10]] in [[Mobile County, Alabama|Mobile]], south and central [[Choctaw County, Alabama|Choctaw]], and [[Baldwin County, Alabama|Baldwin]] counties. Along the [[Fowl River|Fowl]] and [[Fish River, Alabama|Fish]] rivers, in Mobile and Baldwin counties respectively, significant damage to homes occurred due to flooding. Most roads on [[Dauphin Island]] were flooded in over a foot of water. A few homes were close to falling into [[Mobile Bay]], and one home had to be moved backwards towards land to prevent its destruction.<ref name="NCDCalabama">{{cite web|author=NCDC|year=1997|title=Event Record Details: Hurricane (Alabama)|publisher=[[NCDC]]|accessdate=2007-01-01|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~299512}}</ref> At the peak of the storm in [[Alabama]], at least 44,000 people were without power in [[Mobile County, Alabama|Mobile]] and [[Baldwin County, Alabama|Baldwin]] counties. In rural [[Choctaw County, Alabama|Choctaw County]], north of Mobile, several families were rescued from flooded roads and trapped cars.<ref name="cnn92297"/> The majority of houses and businesses on Dauphin Island and buildings from the western shore of [[Mobile Bay]], and from [[Fort Morgan, Alabama|Fort Morgan]] east to [[Orange Beach, Alabama|Orange Beach]] had [[roof]] damage. $60.5&nbsp;million (1997&nbsp;USD, $77&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD) in total property damage occurred in Alabama, in addition to [[pecan]] and [[pine tree]] damage costing $2.5&nbsp;million (1997&nbsp;USD, $3.21&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD).<ref name="NCDCalabama"/>

===East Coast===

The heavy rains caused two people to drown in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]. A girl drowned after being swept into a creek by the floodwaters. Another woman drowned from the floodwaters while in her car. Four indirect deaths occurred from traffic accidents during the storm's onslaught in Georgia.<ref name="tcr"/> The tornado in Portsmouth wiped out a car wash, caused six other businesses to suffer lesser damage, including a lumber company that had its roof torn off, and one large [[Semi-trailer truck|truck big-rig wheeler]] overturned. A severe drought had been in place in the [[Mid-Atlantic States]] during the month of July. Copious rainfall amounts helped bring a minor relief to the drought. Only minor damage occurred, despite strong winds experienced in southeastern [[Massachusetts]].<ref name="cox">{{cite web|author=|year=1997|title=Tropical Storm Danny Visits Portsmouth!|publisher=|accessdate=2006-12-28|url=http://members.cox.net/wxr/danny97.htm}}</ref> The minor damage included minimal flooding, power outages, and downed tree limbs.<ref name="usatoday"/>

==Aftermath and records==
Debris remained in the inland waters of [[Alabama]], at least up until [[August 12]], 1997. Endangered or threatened [[sea turtles]], which all within U.S waters are identified as, lived in these waters. Specialized turtle exclusion devices, known as TED's, or specialized [[Net (device)|nets]] that allowed the turtles to escape them, were required before Danny for shrimp trawlers. The Director of the [[Marine (ocean)|Marine]] Resources Division of the [[Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]] said that the "inordinate amount of [[debris]] is causing extraordinary difficulty with the performance of (TED's) in these areas." Therefore, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] allowed an alternative to the TED's, of shorter tow times of a maximum of 55 minutes from [[April 1]] through [[October 31]], and a maximum of 75 minutes from [[November 1]] through [[March 31]]. The EPA intended to minimize any sea turtle casualties as a result of allowing trawlers to remove the TED's.<ref name="epa1">{{cite web|author=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|year=1997|title=Sea Turtle Conservation; Shrimp Trawling Requirements|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=2006-12-29|url=http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-SPECIES/1997/August/Day-12/e21170.htm}}</ref>

The storm dropped 36.71&nbsp;inches (932&nbsp;mm) of rain on Dauphin Island, setting the new record for the most tropical or subtropical cyclone related rainfall in the state of Alabama, and is among the largest in the [[United States]].<ref name="tcr"/> The storm also became the earliest 5th tropical or subtropical storm of a season when it reached tropical storm strength on [[July 17]]. This record was broken in the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]] when [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Hurricane Emily]] first attained tropical storm status on [[July 12]], just five days earlier.<ref name="hurdat_1997_4">{{cite web| author=NHC Hurricane Research Division| title=Atlantic hurricane best track ("HURDAT")| publisher=NOAA| date=[[2006-02-17]]|accessdate=2007-01-02| url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/easyhurdat_5105.html#1997_4 }}</ref>

The name Danny was not retired by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] in the spring of 1998 and it was [[Hurricane Danny (2003)|re-used]] in the [[2003 Atlantic hurricane season]]. It is currently on the list of names to be used again in the [[2009 Atlantic hurricane season]].
