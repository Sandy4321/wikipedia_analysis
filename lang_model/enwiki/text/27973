"'''Open Arms'''" is a song originally recorded by American [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Journey (band)|Journey]] and written by [[Steve Perry (musician)|Steve Perry]] and [[Jonathan Cain]], two of the band's members. It is a ballad depicting the struggle of lovers who are trying to reconcile by starting anew with "open arms." It has been covered by the American [[Pop music|pop]]/[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Mariah Carey]], Korean singer [[Younha]], Taiwanese boyband [[5566 (band)|5566]], [[country music]] singer [[Collin Raye]], and the [[Contemporary R&B]] group [[Boyz II Men]].

==Journey version==
Journey recorded "Open Arms" for their seventh studio album, ''[[Escape (Journey album)|Escape]]'', which was produced by [[Kevin Elson]] and [[Mike "Clay" Stone|Mike Stone]]. Jonathan Cain had begun writing the song while he was still a member of the rock group [[The Babys]], but Babys vocalist [[John Waite]] turned down the melody as "sentimental rubbish." Cain eventually finished the song with Steve Perry during the writing sessions for ''Escape'', but it was almost left off the album; Journey's guitarist [[Neal Schon]] reportedly disliked the song because "it was so far removed from anything [Journey] had ever attempted to record before".<ref>VH1 - Behind the Music - Journey</ref> (drummer Steve Smith recalls that Schon noted that it "sounds kinda [[Mary Poppins]]"<ref>VH1 - Behind the Music - Journey</ref>).  Added to which the other members of the band were against the idea of performing ballads.<ref>[http://steveperry-thejourneybeyond.com/bio.html travel media shopping computers hardware at steveperry-thejourneybeyond.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Steve Perry later recalled of the song's recording: "I had to keep my head down on the console when "Open Arms" was on.  There is one line in the song that I always wanted to be a certain way. I have ideals about certain things. The line "wanting you near" <U+2014> I just wanted that line to go up and soar. I wanted it to be heartfelt.  Every time it would come by I would just have to keep my head down and try to swallow the lump in my throat.  I felt so proud of the song".<ref>[http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/Interviews05/steveperry05.htm]</ref> 

In the Journey episode of [[VH1]]'s [[Behind The Music]], Perry recalls the recording sessions for the song becoming an ordeal; Schon taunted Perry and Cain in the studio.  But when the band performed it in concert for the first time during their Escape Tour in the fall of 1981, the audience was thunderstruck, much to Schon's disbelief.  After two encores, the band left the stage and Schon suddenly said, "Man, that song really kicked ass!"  Perry recalled being incensed at Schon's hypocrisy.  "I looked at him, and I wanted to kill him," he later said.<ref>VH1 - Behind the Music - Journey</ref>

During an episode of the radio show ''[[In the Studio with Redbeard]]'' devoted to the album ''Escape'', Jonathan Cain said he was ill with a bad cold when he recorded the piano track to "Open Arms" and wanted to re-do the track. Everybody else disagreed and they used the track Cain recorded while "under the weather."

"Open Arms" was used on the soundtrack to the animated Canadian film ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (released to theatres in August 1981), and it was released as the third single from ''Escape'' in January 1982 in the United States. It was also featured on two occasions during scenes of the 1982 film ''[[The Last American Virgin]]''. It became one of Journey's biggest singles there, and the most successful of the five singles released from ''Escape'' (only one other, "Who's Crying Now," reached the top five). Although it never reached number 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart, it stayed at number 2 for six weeks, and it was also a top ten hit on [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]]. The single was less successful on the [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]], only reaching the top forty.

The song and its status as a [[power ballad]] has been remembered years following its original release. One critic praised "Open Arms" as "a lyrical rock ballad and one of the band's best-written songs",<ref>[http://www.steveperryfanclub.homestead.com/JourneyHasntLostItsPopularTouch.html "Journey Hasn't Lost Its Popular Touch"; December 1986<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> while the [[Associated Press]] wrote that the song was "fueled by Perry's operatic, high-flying vocal style."<ref>[http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/14308947 Steve Perry News on Yahoo! Music<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It has also been referred to as a "wedding anthem" (in a December 2005 ''[[Lumino Magazine]]'' article<ref>[http://www.luminomagazine.com/mw/content/view/916/10/ LuminoMagazine.com - Journey doesn't stop believin'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>), and [[VH1]] placed the song at number 1 on their "25 Greatest Power Ballads" list.<ref>http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/the_greatest/66390/episode_countdown.jhtml</ref> [[Allmusic]] said "One of rock's most beautiful ballads, "Open Arms" gleams with an honesty and feel only Steve Perry could muster,"<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:eif1zfoheh7k~T1 allmusic ((( Escape > Review )))<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and a review of a Journey concert in the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' characterized the song as a "classic ballad."<ref>[http://www.accessatlanta.com/blogs/content/shared-blogs/accessatlanta/musicmidtown/entries/2004/05/02/journey.html Journey | Music Midtown Live | AccessAtlanta<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Steve Perry told the ''[[Boston Globe]]'', "I can't tell you how many times I get a tap on the shoulder and somebody says...'This was my prom song'."<ref>[http://www.boston.com/ae/celebrity/articles/2005/11/05/he_never_stopped_believin/ He never stopped believin' - The Boston Globe<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The song was later included on Journey's box set ''[[Time 3]]'' (1992) and the compilation album ''[[The Essential Journey]]'' (2001).

In 2003 ''[[American Idol]]'' contestant [[Clay Aiken]] performed the song during a key semi-final round of the show, and later in a duet with fellow Idol [[Kelly Clarkson]] (the winner from the previous year) on their joint February<U+2014>April 2004 concert tour. The song was also chosen for third place [[American Idol (season 5)|''American Idol'' 5]] contestant [[Elliott Yamin]] by [[Clive Davis]] before being eliminated. UK ''[[The X Factor (UK)|X Factor]]'' contestant Joe McElderry sang the song in the semi-final of the 2009 series. "Open Arms" was included on the set list for [[Britney Spears]]' 1999 [[...Baby One More Time Tour]], and it was also used as the love theme for Japanese director Eiichiro Hasumi's film ''Umizaru'' (2004). Hasumi said that he wanted to call to mind a high school romance with the song's inclusion, and the film's screenwriter reportedly listened to it several times whilst writing the film.<ref>[http://www.midnighteye.com/reviews/umizaru.shtml Midnight Eye review: Umizaru (2004, Eiichiro HASUMI)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]], the creators of the animated television comedy ''[[South Park]]'', frequently reference and parody Journey and their music in their work. In Episode 909 of ''South Park'', entitled "[[Erection Day]]" (2005), a little girl playing piano in a talent competition begins to sing the opening to "Open Arms" ("Lying beside you, here in the dark...") before the scene ends. In the 2007 film ''[[I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry]]'' the song is played during a gay benefit costume party. "Open Arms" is one of twelve greatest hits re-recorded by Journey featuring current lead vocalist [[Arnel Pineda]] on the second disc of their latest 2008 album ''[[Revelation (Journey album)|Revelation]]''.

[[Mariah Carey]] co-produced her cover of the song with [[Walter Afanasieff]] for her fifth album, ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]''. Carey's career has crossed paths with Journey's: the band's drummer [[Steve Smith (musician)|Steve Smith]] played drums on many of her earlier singles, and its bassist for a short period in the mid-1980s, [[Randy Jackson]], has worked with her for a long time. 

It was released as the album's third single in 1996 in most markets outside the United States, and performed moderately. It became a top five hit in the United Kingdom, one of only a handful of countries that the song reached the top ten. The single's music video, directed by [[Larry Jordan]], is a live performance of the song by Carey at [[Madison Square Garden]]. The video for the Spanish version of the song, "El Amor Que So<U+00F1><U+00E9>", is also a live performance from that night.

A UK CD single for "Open Arms" included the ''Daydream'' track "I Am Free" and live versions of "[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]" and "[[Vision of Love]]" (1990). Another version of the CD single comprised the album cuts of "[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]" (1993) and "[[Without You (Badfinger song)#Mariah Carey version|Without You]]" (1994), and a radio edit of "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)#Mariah Carey version|I'll Be There]]" (1992).
