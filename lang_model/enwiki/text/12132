'''The Doon School''' is an [[independent school|independent]] [[boarding school]] located in [[Dehradun]] in the state of [[Uttarakhand]] in [[India]]. Established in 1935, it was founded by [[Satish Ranjan Das]]. Its first [[Head teacher|headmaster]] was Arthur E. Foot, a former science [[Schoolmaster|master]] at [[Eton College]].

The school has 480 students, graduating classes number about 80, and the total number of alumni who have graduated, since the school was founded, is estimated at 5,000. 

There are 67 teachers, of which 15 are women, with a teacher:student ratio of 1:8. The school offers 120 scholarships, including partial and full financial support, and approximately 25% of the students benefit from financial aid. Doon is a boys-only school; the only girls who have studied there have been the daughters of schoolmasters. Since 2008 the school has begun to teach the [[International Baccalaureate]] Diploma Programme following the trend set by other public schools.

The goal of the school is to provide young Indians with a [[liberal arts|liberal education]], and to instill in them a respect for the ideals of [[secularism]], [[discipline]] and [[egalitarianism|equality]].

== History ==
[[File:Doon School Logo.jpg|thumb|''Lamp of Knowledge'' is the official Doon School logo]]

Doon was founded by [[Satish Ranjan Das]], an eminent lawyer from [[Calcutta]]<ref>[http://www.ebc-india.com/lawyer/articles/77v4a1.htm Eastern Book Company - Practical Lawyer<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.bengalspider.com/resources/3490-deshbandhu-chittaranjan-das-profile-family-details.aspx Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das - Family, Career, Profile<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> who in 1927 became a member of [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Irwin's]] [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]] on the condition that he would use the prestige of this position to raise funds for a new type of [[Independent school|school]] in India. He traveled widely in India with a goal of collecting [[Rupees]] 40 [[lakhs]], but at the time of his death had raised only Rs. 10 lakhs in cash, and another Rs. 10 lakhs in promises. With the money, Das formed the Indian Public Schools Society (which "owns" the school in a technical sense although the school operates independently){{clarify|date=January 2012}} with the object of founding new public schools in India that would admit students without regard to caste, creed or social status. 

Following Das's death in 1928, the IPSS did not accomplish very much and by 1934 some of the original donors to the project had started to inquire about the return of their money. At this point, Sir Joseph Bhore, then Railway Minister of [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|Lord Willingdon's]] Council, became Chairman of the IPSS and, with [[Akbar Hydari|Sir Akbar Hydari]] as secretary, worked to obtain from the former estate of the [[Forest Research Institute]] in [[Dehra Dun]] on favorable terms. [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], then president of the Board of Education, lead a selection committee that picked Arthur E. Foot, a science master at [[Eton College]], to be the first headmaster.

The [[dormitory|houses]] at the new School were originally named for their respective [[housemaster]]s, but later renamed to honor the largest donors to the Indian Public School Society:
*Hyderabad House, after Sir Akbar Hydari secured a contribution of Rs. 2 lakhs from the [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad's]] Government.
*Kashmir House, after [[Maharajah]] [[Hari Singh]] promised a contribution of Rs. 1 lakh which was delivered in 1935.
*Tata House, after the [[Tata family|Tata]] and [[Wadia family|Wadia]] Trusts promised Rs. 1.5 lakhs, of which half was  delivered in 1935.
*Jaipur House, after [[Rai Bahadur]] Amarnath Atal arranged for contributions of Rs. 1 lakh from the [[Jaipur]] Durbar and smaller contributions from the tributary [[Thakur (Indian title)|Thikanas]].

(No building was named after [[Rai Bahadur]] Rameshwar Nathany whose donation of Rs. 1 lakh was initially made anonymously.)

On October 27, 1935, the [[Viceroy]], [[Lord Willingdon]], came to preside over the formal opening of the school.  There were 70 boys enrolled in the first [[semester|term]], and another 110 boys had signed up for the second term.

== Ethos ==
[[File:Arthur E. Foot.jpg|thumb|Arthur E. Foot, a former Science master at [[Eton College]], was the first Headmaster of The Doon School]]
[[File:The Main Building at Doon.jpg|thumb|The ''Main Building'' of the school.]]
Arthur Foot had never visited India before accepting the position, and knew little of [[Dehradun]] beyond what he found after consulting an [[atlas]]: he noted that it appeared to be surrounded by forests and close to mountains, and the possibilities of outdoor recreation and mountaineering appeared to have influenced his decision as much as the chance to create a completely new type of school in India.<ref name="sixtyyears">''The Doon School Sixty Years On'', published by the Doon School Old Boys' Society, October 1996.</ref>

Foot's first action upon being offered the position was to recruit John (J.A.K.) Martyn from [[Harrow School|Harrow]] as his deputy.  Doon's ethos and guiding principles were determined early in its life by Foot, Martyn, RL Holdsworth and Jack Gibson (who went on to become Principal of [[Mayo College]]).  While these masters all came from very traditional British schools, they were determined to create a uniquely Indian public school rather than a transplanted British institution, and they were soon joined in their efforts by equally influential Indians such as Sudhir Khastigir (the school's first art teacher, who had trained previously at [[Santiniketan]]) and Gurudial Singh (a pioneering mountaineer, who taught at Doon for several decades and acquired a reverential following among generations of alumni).

In an essay entitled ''The Objects of Education'' published in the school magazine, Foot outlined the basic template for a Doon education:
:''A complete education should teach a child:
:''1. to be able to distinguish between good and evil;
:''2. to form the habit of choosing good rather than evil;
:''3. to have his brain trained to think logically;
:''4. to have a reasonably wide general knowledge of important facts about the world in which we live;
:''5. to be able to express himself clearly in speech or in writing in the language or languages of the people with whom he will work;
:''6. to have a body that is healthy, strong and vigorous, and to know how to look after it;
:''7. to have developed a sensitiveness to beauty and taste and feeling that will strive to eradicate ugliness from his surroundings.''<ref name="sixtyyears" />

In other essays, Foot marked the milestones in the development of each student:
:''By 14 he should have learnt all the ordinary principles of social behavior.  He should know how to stand up and speak to a variety of different types of people -- to his own mother, to someone else's mother, to his father, to his schoolmasters, to servants, to [[Mahatma Gandhi]] or to the [[Viceroy]], and to do this without any self-consciousness...  At fourteen a boy should have constructed a framework of competence in language, in mathematical ability, and in social behavior.  After that age he is, as it were, filling in a design to the framework.  In short he learning to exercise taste... At 16, he acquired taste, a sense of the beautiful and the ugly, of the strong and the weak, of good and evil... At 17 must come another quality, less instinctive and requiring a maturer mind: he must acquire a capacity for judgement.''<ref name="sixtyyears" />

In a letter to parents, written in 1940 in the context of World War II, Jack Gibson wrote:
:''There are still too many boys blind to what they could see and deaf to what they could hear.  They leave their minds blank, to be filled by the unbeautiful and untruthful, by unscrupulous propaganda, by debased public taste, by flattery and by appeals to fears and prejudices, to which a person without a mind of his own turns for second-hand and usually second-class opinions...  When they leave school, they will join the ranks of those whose opinions are made for them by dictators, party leaders, or the writers of advertisements for patent medicines: it will depend upon what rut they get into... In these anxious times, it is more than ever important that each boy must train himself to think clearly so that he will be willing to come to conclusions that may be different from what he has expected and may point to something different from what we were brought up to believe to be the [[social order|accepted order]]. He must train his body to undergo hardships and be prepared for unexpected discomforts, and above all he must awaken and sharpen his sympathies for and understanding of people outside his own [[social class|class]] and [[social circle|circle]].<ref name="sixtyyears"/>''

Martyn, who became Doon's second Headmaster and had a continuing involvement with Doon over several decades, acknowledged the influence of [[Kurt Hahn]] in the development of Doon's ethos:
:''I do not think I would ever have come to India if it had not been for that very remarkable German Jew, Kurt Hahn...  When I first knew him I was teaching history at [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and he was head of [[Schule Schloss Salem|Salem]], a school he had established on the shores of [[Lake Constance]], based on the ideas of [[Plato]] and the principles of British public schools...  I longed to put his ideas into practice but at conservative Harrow I had no opportunity to do so.  When I read in [[The Times]] that A.E. Foot of Eton had been appointed headmaster of a new public school to be opened for Indian boys at Dehra Dun, I offered to come with him and my offer was accepted...  I had no previous interest in India; what interested me was the chance of starting a public school in a new environment... It was Arthur Foot who did the main planning, but luckily his ideas ran parallel to my own.  I would not have been as bold as he was in trying to eliminate punishments, but we were equally keen on providing as wide a range as possible of activities that were creative and challenging... The problem, as we saw it, was to create an atmosphere in which boys would learn the importance of public spirit at the same time as they acquired self-confidence and initiative.''<ref name="sahibs">''Sahibs who loved India'', edited by [[Khushwant Singh]], September 2009</ref>

== Campus ==
[[File:Centre Lawn in Doon.jpg|thumb|Lawns in front of ''Main Building'']]
[[File:Amphitheatre - The Rose Bowl - at Doon School.JPG|thumb|left|The Rose Bowl - Venue for school plays, functions and morning assembly.]]
The school consists of a single [[campus]], covering approximately {{convert|70|acre|m2}} in the city of [[Dehradun]] in the state of [[Uttarakhand]] in [[India]].

To house the School, the Indian Public Schools Society acquired Chandbagh Estate in Dehradun from the [[Forest Research Institute]]. Part of the estate, where the Central Dining Hall is now located, was once a deer park. The IPSS also acquired an adjoining estate from the descendants of [[James Skinner (East India Company officer)|James Skinner]], which forms the part of the campus known as ''Skinner's Field''. At the time of acquisition, Skinner's was an overgrown and somewhat neglected estate, and its most prominent features were two sheds formerly used for housing elephants.

The new Art and Media School, located at the site of the old Music School and inaugurated in October 2010 by [[Kapil Sibal]], was nominated for an international design award.<ref>[http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&upload_id=15859 World Architecture News February 13 2011]</ref> The school<U+2019>s South Garden has been mentioned in Inside Outside Magazine<U+2019>s Annual Awards for its green principles and [[GRIHA]] standards of environmental compatibility.

==== Nature ====

The Chandbagh estate is located in the greenest part of [[Dehradun]]<ref name="wsj" /> and a wide variety of [[flora]] and [[fauna]] may be found on the estate.  These include many rare trees that date back to the estate's original use by the [[Forest Research Institute]], while the immaculately-maintained formal gardens have long attracted a wide variety of birds.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books/about/Trees_of_Chandbagh.html?id=IRBFAAAAYAAJ Trees of Chandbagh, K.C. Sahni]</ref> (The ornithologist [[Salim Ali]] was a frequent visitor and speaker at Doon for several decades.<ref>''The Doon School Register'', published by The Doon School Old Boys Society every few years.  The 1998 edition, among others lists Dr. Ali.</ref>)

== Life at Doon ==
=== Pupils ===
[[File:Nehru in Kashmir House, The Doon School.jpg|thumb|[[Jawaharlal Nehru]] with the boys of the school]]
Pupils are known as ''Doscos''; the term is a contraction of "Doon" and "School".  (Alumni are often referred to in the press as "Doscos", although within Doon itself alumni are referred to as ex-Doscos, or simply as [[Old Boys]].)

The vast majority of alumni are Indians, but a dwindling number are from [[Pakistan]]: they studied at Doon before [[Partition of India|Partition]] forced them to leave in 1947. Relations between Indian and Pakistani Doscos have remained warm over the years, despite the long history of conflict between the two countries. Boys from [[Bangladesh]] and [[Nepal]] continue to study at Doon.

Doon remains a boys-only school despite continued pressure to become [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]].<ref name="president">''President leads assault on Doon School heritage'' The Pioneer, Oct 4 2010 [http://www.dailypioneer.com/291832/President-leads-assault-on-Doon-School-heritage.html]</ref>  A small number of girls, all daughters of schoolmasters, have studied at Doon over the years.

=== Terms ===

The academic year has always consisted of two [[semester|terms]]: the Spring Terms and the Autumn Term.  In the early decades, the academic year followed the calendar year; this changed in the late 1970s so that the Spring Term now runs from February through the end of May.  New pupils ("D-Formers") join Doon at the beginning of April.

The Autumn Term runs from August through November, with year-end examinations in November after which the boys are promoted to the new class beginning February.  Traditionally, year-end examinations were known as ''Trials'', with the examinations that granted various certificates such as the [[Indian School Certificate]] known as ''Finals''.

=== Houses ===
[[File:Kashmir House, Doon School.jpg|thumb|Kashmir House with its Quad]]
[[File:Tata House in Doon.jpg|thumb|Tata House at night]]
[[File:Jaipur House in Doon.jpg|thumb|Jaipur House on a misty morning]]
[[File:Oberoi House in Doon.jpg|thumb|Oberoi House behind the Skinner's Field]]
Doon follows the [[House System]], with five administrative units, or [[Dormitory|dorm]]-like ''houses'', named, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kashmir, Tata, and Oberoi. In addition, there are two "Holding Houses", Foot and Martyn, named after former [[Head teacher|Headmasters]], where "D-Formers" live for one year before they move into the main houses.

Each house is run by a [[Housemaster]], who is also an active member of the teaching staff.  Housemasters are assisted by a senior boy known as the House Captain. One senior boy serves as [[School Captain]] and is assisted by [[Prefect|School Prefects]] from each of the houses.  Boys are assigned to Houses at the time of admission, and develop great loyalty to their Houses since all [[intramural sports]] involve fierce competition between Houses.  Boys with even the most distant family connections to a particular House are invariably assigned to that House in order to further promote loyalty to the House. For some alumni, inter-House rivalry continues well into middle-age.

For many decades, Housemasters were always men but now there are Housemistresses as well.  Housemaster and Housemistresses are assisted by a [[matron]] known as "The Dame" of the House in providing important [[pastoral care]] for pupils, some of whom take several terms to fully adjust to life in a boarding school, particularly given Doon's monastic lifestyle and strict regimen for daily life.  Housemasters and Housemistresses live in homes that are adjacent or physically attached to their Houses so that they can remain close at hand for both supervision and support.

(For a couple of decades, beginning in 1970, each of the main Houses was divided into two smaller Houses, named "A" and B", so that Kashmir House, for example, became Kashmir-A and Kashmir-B. This was done to increase the level of [[pastoral care]]. The Houses were subsequently merged back together so that the "A" and "B" distinctions are no longer used.)

Each House also has a set of House Tutors who supervise ''Toye'' during the week, take the younger boys on mid-term hiking trips, and also tutor members of the house.

Each main House accommodates 80-90 boys, and the holding Houses are home to 40-45 newly-admitted boys.

== Daily life ==

Individual class periods are referred to as ''Schools''.  The school day begins with ''First Bell'' soon after 6:15AM. The boys get [[chhota haazri]] before doing [[calisthenics]] outdoors on the playing fields.<ref>[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-07-04/special-report/27149351_1_education-system-elite-schools-vikram-seth Chhota Hazri bell tolls for desi Etons - Times Of India<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  There are two schools before breakfast, followed by five schools before lunch.  All meals are served in a Central Dining Hall and boys from each table take turns acting as waiters for their table-mates.

The afternoon includes a rest period as well as time devoted to various extra-circular activities.  In the later afternoon there are compulsory sports before dinner.

Dinner is followed by ''Toye time'' when the students do homework and study on their own. ''Lights Out'' is at 9PM and ''breaking bounds'' to sneak into town late at night remains a tradition.

While the grounds are beautiful, with gardens and rare trees, life for boys is monastic: they sleep on narrow beds and study in unheated rooms; the floors are rough stone and the lights are fluorescent tubes.<ref>[http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/world/20070616-0926-indiaseton.htm Associated Press June 16, 2007]</ref>

Discipline has always been strict, and the school has expelled chidren from well-known families. In the 1950s Headmaster J.A.K. Martyn's suggestion that [[Sanjay Gandhi]] finish his senior year elsewhere was unquestioningly accepted by his mother, [[Indira Gandhi]]. In contrast, Doon's decision to expel a ward of Chief Minister [[Nityanand Swami]] of [[Uttarkhand]] in 2001 resulted in threats to cut off power and water<ref name="indiatoday">[[India Today]] April 23, 2001 [http://www.india-today.com/itoday/20010423/school2.shtml]</ref> (nothing came of these threats after Mr. Swami discovered that Doon had stronger political connections than he did).

== Sports ==

[[File:Cricket at Doon.jpg|thumb|A cricket game in progress]]
[[File:Marching in Doon.jpg|thumb|[[Marching]] marks the end of athletics season in Doon every year ]]
Doon hosts the annual Afzal Khan Memorial Basketball Tournament which is the biggest inter-school basketball tournament in the country,<ref>Uttarakhand Basketball Association (UABA) - Performance Report 22nd March, 2011 [http://www.indiabasketball.org/newsdetails.php?id=402&news=Uttarakhand%20%20Basketball%20Association%20(UABA)%20-%20Performance%20Report]</ref><ref>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020504/ncr3.htm Tribune Online Edition, May 4, 2002]</ref>
The tournament has since achieved international repute and is now popular among South-Asian countries.<ref>[[Woodstock School]] News Sprint 2010 [http://www.woodstock.ac.in/News/Spring2010/April/100412.htm]</ref> 
The school has over {{convert|30|acre|m2}} of playing fields. The two biggest playing fields are known as ''Skinner's'' and the ''Main Field''.
Sports are a compulsory part of school life: cricket, hockey, athletics, boxing and [[Association football|football]] are seasonal sports. Tennis, table tennis, badminton, squash, basketball, swimming and gymnastics tournaments are also available.
*During the Spring Term, the sport curriculum is dominated by [[Cricket]] and [[Field hockey|Hockey]].
*During the Autumn Term it is dominated by the [[Association football|Soccer]], [[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]] and [[Boxing]].
During the Terms, various Inter-house matches are played in Cricket, Hockey and Football.

;Facilities
Sports facilities include:
* 25-metre Swimming Pool
* Boxing Ring
* Multi-Purpose Hall with a [[gym]]nasium and facilities for indoor [[Badminton]], [[Basketball]], and [[Table Tennis]]
* 2 [[artificial turf]] [[Cricket pitch|Pitches]]
* 5 Basketball courts
* 6 Tennis courts
* 4 [[Squash (sport)|Squash]] courts
* 10 [[Cricket nets]]
* 7 Fields for [[Field hockey|hockey]] and [[Association football|soccer]], which can be converted to 4 Cricket pitches to accommodate seasonal sports, and a modern [[Cricket pavilion|Pavilion]]
* 2 400-metres Athletics track

;Overseas tours
The school also goes on overseas tours. Recent tours have included:

* 2008- [[Millfield]], UK - Cricket
* 2009- [[Stowe School]], UK - Cricket

A number of alumni have become national champions in [[Squash (sport)|squash]]. (See [[Doon_School alumni (Doscos)#Sports|main article]].)

== Clubs and societies ==
[[File:The Doon School Weekly.jpg|thumb|''The Doon School Weekly'' is the school newspaper and was established in 1936]]
[[Extracurricular activity|Extracurricular activities]] are also a compulsory element of school life, and there are around 23 clubs and societies including debating and chess, and magazines are published in English and Hindi. In many societies pupils come together to discuss a particular topic, presided over by a schoolmaster and often including a guest speaker. Some societies are dedicated solely to music, some to politics, some to drama, and so on. The school has often invited prominent figures to give speeches and talks to the students; these have included heads of state and politicians; ornithologists and naturalists; artists and writers; economists and diplomats; and industrialists.

''The Doon School Weekly'' is the official school newspaper and is distributed every Saturday morning. It chronicles school activities and is a platform for creative and political writing. It was founded in 1936 and is edited by boys at the school. Although liable to censorship, incidents of satire and criticism of school policies have surfaced in the past.  More subversive publications have been produced in the past, without official sponsorship, that were far more critical of teachers and the school establishment.

Other school magazines include ''The Yearbook'', ''The Doon School Information Review''; publications by academic departments include ''Echo'' (Science), ''The Econocrat'' (Economics), ''Infinity'' (Mathematics) and ''The Circle'' (Political Science).

There are societies for Photography, [[Model aircraft|Aeromodelling]], First-Aid, Dramatics, Painting, Sculpture, Music, Carpentry, [[Amateur radio|HAM Radio]], [[Trinity College, London|Trinity Guildhall]] Music Examinations, Senior and Junior English Debating Societies, [[Model United Nations]]<ref>http://www.tribuneindia.com/2011/20110820/dplus.htm#6</ref>, Chess<ref>http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20100424/dplus.htm</ref>, Paper Recycling, Quiz, Maths Colloquium and Astronomy.

== Social work ==

Social work, known formally as ''Socially Useful Productive Work'', is also part of school life, based upon Foot's precept that ''"the boys should leave Doon School as members of an aristocracy, but it must be an aristocracy of service inspired by ideas of unselfishness, not one of privilege, wealth or position."''<ref name="sixtyyears" />  All boys of the school must complete a mandatory quota of social service hours every term. 

Both pupils and alumni have frequently organized efforts, across India, to assist people affected by the earthquakes, tsunamis, landslides and floods. During the [[1991 Uttarkashi earthquake]], for example, when all communication lines were down, the school<U+2019>s [[HAM radio]] club joined hands with the state administration and aid-providers to set up channels of communication with the base station.<ref>http://www.doonschool.com/student-life/supw-social-a-community-service</ref><ref>http://books.google.co.in/books?id=oSbTJDwMFgAC&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=doon+school+uttarkashi+earthquake&source=bl&ots=auVRgAF83Q&sig=v_N_ehY83v5t3-4yNFqyYMG8G_I&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rQEIT8XKC8qWmQXU85X7Bw&ved=0CF8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=doon%20school%20uttarkashi%20earthquake&f=false</ref>  Following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], the ''Doon School Old Boys Society'' organized an extensive relief effort to deliver relief supplies in southern India.<ref>http://www.doonschool.com/student-life/supw-social-a-community-service</ref>

Doon runs a [[Panchayati raj|Panchayat Ghar]] where Doscos teach underprivileged children. Doon has, over the years, adopted villages and worked with the villagers in the construction of houses, community centres and school buildings; sanitation systems; energy efficiency systems; self-employment and small scale irrigation systems. Apart from village development, the school is actively involved with the Raphael Ryder Cheshire International Centre and the [[Cheshire Home]].<ref>http://www.doonschool.com/student-life/supw-social-a-community-service</ref> 

Doon is a regional leader of the [[Round Square]] group of schools and regularly participates and hosts international service projects.  [[The Duke of Edinburgh's Award]] programme, which is run by the School, provides additional incentive for pupils to undertake service projects.<ref>http://www.doonschool.com/student-life/supw-social-a-community-service</ref>

== Midterms and mountaineering ==
[[File:Mt. Everest Base Camp Expedition - 2008, The Doon School.jpg|thumb|Mt. [[Everest Base Camp]] and [[Kala Patthar]] Expedition 2008]]

Halfway through each term, the boys take a one-week ''Midterm'': a rugged trip often through the [[Siwalik Hills]] or [[Himalayas]] which senior boys take unaccompanied and which they plan themselves. This includes [[camping]] out in tents, cooking their own food and [[hiking]]. Alumni have credited these Midterms as being among their most formative and character-building experiences while at school since they require a great deal of self-determination, planning, effort and endurance, particularly for boys who go on five-day treks in the Himalayas unaccompanied by any teachers.<ref>[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2010-11-05/news/27596671_1_doon-school-dosco-batch How the playing fields of Doon nurture India Inc's best leaders]</ref><ref name="wsj">[http://online.wsj.com/ad/article/ii-andover-india.html?mod=sponsored_by_incredibleindia The Andover of India]</ref>

Expeditions by Doscos have had their own idiosyncrasies: after Gurudial Singh lead a successful climb of [[Trisul]], he performed a headstand [[asana]] on the summit as a tribute to the Hindu god [[Shiva]] who is said to abide within Trisul; Holdsworth has been described as holding the high-altitude record for smoking a pipe, which he did on the summit of [[Kamet]] after the first ascent in 1931; and, as a [[Larrikinism|lark]], two Doscos climbed [[Mont Blanc]] in 1951 wearing [[cricket]] boots.<ref name="alpinejournal">[http://www.alpinejournal.org.uk/.../AJ%202001%20197-201%20Anderson%20Doon%20School.pdf ''Climbing with the Doon School'' Richard Anderson, Alpine Journal (PDF)]</ref>

== Theatre and music ==

[[File:Waiting for Godot in Doon School.jpg|thumb|[[Waiting for Godot]] being staged in ''The Rose Bowl'' (Rosy)]]
;Theatre
An [[amphitheatre]] known as ''The Rose Bowl'' (and, today, nicknamed "Rosy") was built largely by pupils in the 1930s.  The Rose Bowl can seat up to 1,000 people and has been the setting for numerous Shakespearean plays, other classics of Western theatre as well as musical performances and speeches during important school ceremonies such as ''Founder's Day''.  The Multi-Purpose Hall is a more modern indoor theatre that can accommodate approximately 2,000 people.

Plays are staged in English and Hindi on a regular basis with 8-9 productions each year, including 2 major productions that are part of the Founder's Day celebrations. The Junior Dramatic Society stages one or two plays a year.

Every year all Houses participate in the Inter House One-Act Play Competition which is directed, produced and staged by boys of respective Houses. The Founder's School Plays, staged in the Autumn Term, are the most prominent events, and usually benefit from a larger cast and budget. The [[stage design]], [[sound design]], [[stage lighting]], and much of the [[set construction]] are the responsibility of the pupils. The Founder's Day plays are sometimes staged in other schools of the country. Plays which have toured the country include [[Macbeth]], [[The History Boys]] and [[The Sunshine Boys]].

In 2009, the Rose Bowl underwent a major structural change while retaining its [[amphitheatre]] style.

[[File:The Music School in Doon.jpg|thumb|The exterior of the Music School]]
;Music
In 2005, a new Music School (pictured) was build beside the Rose Bowl. It houses multiple practice and teaching rooms, a [[Music library]] and a [[Concert hall]]. In 2011, the school invested in the Music Department with a substantial number of new instruments both western and Indian with new [[Yamaha]] pianos and guitars. The Music School also has a [[Schiller Piano Company|Schiller]] [[Piano#Grand|Grand Piano]].
Instruments taught at the Music School include [[Piano]], [[Violin]], [[Classical Guitar]], [[Drum]]s, [[Saxophone]], [[Clarinet]], [[Flute]], [[Tabla]], [[Santoor]], [[Sitar]], [[Mridangam]], and [[Synthesizer]]. Other [[Percussion]], [[Wind]] and [[String]] instruments such as [[Tambourine]], [[Caxixi]], [[Triangle (instrument)|Triangle]], [[Xylophone]] etc. are available for practice by the pupils.

Ms. Priya Chaturvedi is the current [[Music director|Director of Music]]. The school participates in many national competitions; many pupils take the [[Trinity College, London|Trinity Guildhall]] Music Examinations in [[piano]], [[violin]], [[electronic keyboard]], [[classical guitar]] and [[drum]]s.

The School Choir practices daily after lunch in the Music School; sometimes, this is followed by ''[[a cappella]]'' rehearsals. Pupils are also responsible for the [[sound design]], [[set design]] and [[stage management]] for all music productions and competitions.

== Awards ==

The school awards include School Colours, House Colours, and various Sports Colours. The Games Blazer and the Scholar's Blazer are awarded to students who excel at sports and academics, respectively, and are much harder to achieve than the other Colours.

The school originally had no [[valedictorian]] or [[Graduation|commencement]] ceremony and boys would leave as soon as they had completed their [[board exams]].  In March 2011, an annual ceremony was established to celebrate the graduating class's departure from the School.

== School Songs ==
{{Listen|filename=Jana_Gana_Mana_instrumental.ogg<U+200E> |title=Song No. 1 - ''Jana Gana Mana'' (instrumental)|description=Song No. 1 later became the [[Jana Gana Mana|National Anthem of India]].}}
Morning Assembly requires attendance by all pupils and schoolmasters, and traditionally begins with a song from the school's Song Book:

*Song No. 1 - ''[[Jana Gana Mana]]'' (by [[Rabindranath Tagore]])
*Song No. 2 - ''Chisti Ne Jis Zamin Mein'' (by [[Muhammad Iqbal]])
*Song No. 3 - ''Anand Loke'' (by [[Rabindranath Tagore]])
*Song No. 4 - ''[[Saare Jahan Se Achcha]]'' (by [[Muhammad Iqbal]])
*Song No. 5 - ''Lab Pe Aati Hai Dua'' (by [[Muhammad Iqbal]])
*Song No. 6 - ''Vandana Ke In Swaron Mein'' (a [[Bhajan]])
*Song No. 7 - ''Ghungat Ke Pat Khol Re'' (attributed to [[Meerabai]])
*Song No. 8 - ''He Jagtrata Vishv Vidhata''
*Song No. 9 - ''Pitu Matu Sahayak'' (a [[Bhajan]])
*Song No. 10 - ''[[Vande Mataram]]'' (from a poem by [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]])

Although ''[[Jana Gana Mana]]'' is  India's [[National anthem]], it is traditionally referred to as "Song No. 1" at Doon since it was adopted as the School Song in 1935,<ref name="srivastava">''Constructing Post-Colonial India: National Character and the Doon School'' by Sanjay Srivastva [http://books.google.com/books?q=Constructing+PostColonial+India:+National+Character+and+the+Doon+School]</ref> fifteen years before it was adopted as India's National Anthem. The school songs were deliberately chosen to include both Urdu poetry and Hindu [[bhajan]]s as a way of emphasizing Doon's secular ethos; similarly, the school prayers include a mix of Anglican hymns and Indian poetry.

== Founder's Day ==

Doon's best-known celebration takes place on ''Founder's Day'', a 3<U+2013>4 days celebration of the founding of the school in 1935.  It is held in the Autumn Term, usually in the last week of October.

Many ex-Doscos come from all parts of the world to celebrate the event. Security on campus is tight since alumni attending the event frequently include senior politicians and government officials, and the Chief Guest is usually someone of considerable prominence in public life.<ref>The [[Dalai Lama]] at the Doon School Founder's Day in 2011 [http://dalailama.com/webcasts/post/215-doon-schools-founders-day-ceremonies]</ref> The major English Drama Productions are held as part of the event which is followed by a Orchestral Music Production organized by members of the School Music Society.

=== DS-75 celebrations ===

[[File:Doon 75th Founder's Day Logo.jpg|thumb|Doon School#DS-75 Celebrations|DS-75 Logo]]
Doon celebrated its 75th Founder's Day ([[Platinum Jubilee]]) in October 2010; the event was christened as ''DS-75'' ("Doon School 75").
The celebrations were widely reported to be of an unprecedented scale.<ref name="Doon school">[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2010-10-08/news/27591639_1_celebrations-doon-school-chief-guest Economic Times, Oct 8, 2010]</ref><ref name="Back to School">[http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/KaranThapar/Back-to-school/Article1-617070.aspx Hindustan Times, Oct 23, 2010]</ref><ref name="Founder's Day celebrations to begin at Doon School">[http://www.dailypioneer.com/state-editions/dehradun/15930-founders-day-celebrations-to-begin-at-doon-school.html Daily Pioneer October 26 2011]</ref> The Chief Guests included [[Pratibha Patil]] ([[President of India]]), [[Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck]] ([[King of Bhutan]]) and [[Kapil Sibal]] ([[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Union Minister for Human Resource Development]]).

The much-anticipated<ref>http://www.thefreelibrary.com/A+matter+of+debate+at+Doon+School+platinum+jubilee.-a0240443417</ref> Chandbagh Debates on the topic ''Can India Lead?'' were moderated by [[Karan Thapar]], and included fellow [[List of Doon School alumni|Doscos]] [[Vikram Seth]], [[Kanti Bajpai]], [[Kamal Nath]], [[Manpreet Singh Badal]] and [[Jyotiraditya Madhavrao Scindia]]. The discussion was frank, with a sardonic reference by Mr. Thapar to corruption charges that had been leveled against one of the panelists.<ref>http://www.garhwalpost.com/article/Dehradun/8546/</ref>

[[Ashvin Kumar]] made a film for the event entitled ''[[Ashvin Kumar#Dazed in Doon|Dazed in Doon]]'' using pupils for the cast and crew. Most of the film was shot in June<U+2013>July during the Summer Break, and the scenes which required the entire student body were filmed after the school re-opened in August.<ref>http://www.imaginox.co.uk/course/1718</ref>  

[[Shayan Italia]], another ex-[[Doscos|Dosco]], composed the song ''Doscos Forever, Brothers for Life'' to mark the event and gave a live performance of the song.<ref>http://issuu.com/unigross/docs/yearbook_sample</ref>

== Doon and other schools ==
=== Historic links ===

[[Welham Boys School]], from its foundation in 1937 through the early 1980s, acted a [[Preparatory School (UK)|preparatory school]] (i.e. [[feeder school]]) to Doon and [[Mayo College]]. This link ended when Surendra "Charlie" Kandhari, a Dosco and former Housemaster at Doon, became Principal of Welham and transformed it to a high school. As a result, many Doscos from the 1940s through the 1970s are also ''Welhamites''.

Doon has long had a familial relationship with [[Welham Girls School]]: several families who chose to send their boys to Doon also chose to send their daughters to Welhams, and many Doscos over the years have married alumni of Welham Girls.  An annual "dance social" with Welham Girls was the highlight of the senior year for many Doscos, and alumni events are sometimes coordinated by the alumni of both schools.

In 1998 the [[Chand Bagh School]] was established by Pakistani [[Doscos]] approximately 40&nbsp;km north of [[Lahore]], Pakistan, and modeled on the general structure of Doon.

=== Exchange programs ===

Doon has exchange programs with a number of overseas schools; at present, a small number of Doscos are attending [[Eton College]],  [[Harrow School]],  [[Millfield]],  [[Schule Schloss Salem]],  [[The Armidale School]],  [[Bridge House School]],  [[Deerfield Academy]],  [[King's Academy]],  [[Stowe School]] and [[St. Mark's School (Texas)]].<ref name="exchange">Doon School Old Boys Society Newsletter Sept 2011</ref>

Doon is current hosting students from  [[Ballarat Grammar School]],  [[Brunswick School]],  [[Groton School]],  [[St Edward's School, Oxford]],  [[St. Mark's School (Texas)]] and  [[Stowe School]].

=== Associations ===

[[File:HMC logo.jpg|thumb|HMC]]
The school is a member of the [[G20 Schools]], the [[Round Square]], the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]], and the [http://www.theibsc.org/ International Boys<U+2019> Schools Coalition]. The [[BBC]]'s World Olympic Dreams School Search twinned Doon with [[The Thomas Hardye School]] in Jan 2011.

=== Schools with similar names ===

As India's private schooling industry expanded, several schools were established that appear to have been named in a deliberately confusing manner: there is the Doon Global School, Doon Presidency School, Doon International School, Doon Preparatory School, Doon Cambridge School, Doon Girls School, [[Doon Public School]] (which is not even located in the [[Doon Valley]]), and even a Doon College of Spoken English, none of which are related to The Doon School.<ref name="indiatoday" />  Some schools have even adopted Doon's [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncrasies]] at face value: for example, the [[Delhi Public School, Mathura Road|Delhi Public School]] offers "Marker Cups" to those who get the highest "marks" in examinations; Doon's Marker Cups, which also are awarded to those who score the highest in particular subjects, were named for the Marker family of Pakistan who donated the Cups.

* ''The Dosco Record'' is a book of short biographies, similar to what may be found in a [[Who's Who]], which was first produced by J.A.K. Martyn who deliberately modeled it on the ''Harrow Record''.  (Martyn had been a schoolmaster at [[Harrow School]] before helping A.E. Foot start The Doon School.)  As a consequence, alumni are listed in the year in which they joined Doon, rather than the year in which they graduated; Martyn believed that this would make it easier for Doscos to look up their friends.  The book is updated every 8 years or so, and is published by the The Doon School Old Boys Society ("DSOBS") and distributed only to alumni.  It includes biographical information about every Dosco (even people like [[Sanjay Gandhi]] who was expelled before completing his studies); it also highlights family connections between Doscos such as whether a particular Dosco was the son of another Dosco, or married the sister or daughter of another Dosco.
