'''Crickets''', family '''Gryllidae''' (also known as "true crickets"), are [[insect]]s related to [[grasshopper]]s. The Gryllidae have mainly cylindrical bodies, round heads and long [[antenna (biology)|antennae]]. Behind the head is a smooth, robust pronotum. The abdomen ends in a pair of long cerci (spikes); females have a long cylindrical [[ovipositor]]. The hind legs have enlarged femora (thighs), providing power for jumping. The front wings are adapted as tough, leathery [[elytron|elytra]] (wing covers) and it is by rubbing parts of these together that some crickets chirp. The hind wings are membranous and folded when not in use for flight; many species however are flightless. The largest members of the family are the bull crickets, ''[[Brachytrupes]]'', which are up to {{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=on}} long.

There are more than 900 [[species]] of crickets; the Gryllidae are distributed all around the world except at latitudes 55<U+00B0> or higher, with the greatest diversity being in the [[tropics]]. They occur in varied habitats from grassland, bushes and forest to marshes, beaches and caves. Crickets are mainly [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]], and are best known for the loud persistent chirping song of males trying to attract females, although some species are mute. The singing species have good hearing, via the tympani (eardrums) on the tibiae of the front legs.

Crickets appear as characters in literature. The [[Talking Cricket]] features in [[Carlo Collodi]]'s 1883 children's book, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', and in films based on the book. The eponymous insect is central to [[Charles Dickens]]'s 1845 ''[[The Cricket on the Hearth]]'', as is the chirping insect in [[George Selden (author)|George Selden]]'s 1960 ''[[The Cricket in Times Square]]''. Crickets are celebrated in poems by [[William Wordsworth]], [[John Keats]], and [[Du Fu]]. They are kept as pets in countries from China to Europe, sometimes for cricket fighting. Crickets are used as food in Southeast Asia, where they are sold deep-fried in markets as snacks. They are also used to feed carnivorous pets and zoo animals. In Brazilian folklore, crickets feature as omens of various events.

==Description==
[[File:african.field.cricket.arp.jpg|thumb|right|African [[field cricket]] ''[[Gryllus bimaculatus]]'']]

Crickets are small to medium-sized insects with mostly cylindrical, somewhat vertically flattened bodies. The head is spherical with long slender antennae arising from cone-shaped scapes (first segments) and just behind these are two large compound eyes. On the forehead are three [[ocelli]] (simple eyes). The [[pronotum]] (first thoracic segment) is trapezoidal in shape, robust and well-[[sclerotin]]ized. It is smooth and has neither dorsal or lateral keels (ridges).<ref name=Otte2007>{{cite book|author=Otte, Daniel |title=Australian Crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae)|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PkvoRnAM6WUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Australian+Crickets+%28Orthoptera:+Gryllidae%29&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gAlNVY-iFfGP7AawwoGACw&ved=0CCQQuwUwAA#v=onepage&q=Morphological%20characteristics&f=false |year=2007 |publisher=Academy of Natural Sciences |isbn=978-1-4223-1928-4 |pages=17<U+2013>24}}</ref>

At the tip of the abdomen is a pair of long [[Cercus|cerci]] (paired appendages on rearmost segment), and in females, the [[ovipositor]] is cylindrical, long and narrow, smooth and shiny. The femora (third segments) of the back pair of legs are greatly enlarged for jumping. The tibiae (fourth segments) of the hind legs are armed with a number of moveable spurs, the arrangement of which is characteristic of each species. The tibiae of the front legs bear one or more tympani which are used for the reception of sound.<ref name=Otte2007/>

The wings lie flat on the body and are very variable in size between species, being reduced in size in some crickets and missing in others. The forewings are [[Elytron|elytra]] made of tough [[chitin]], acting as a protective shield for the soft parts of the body and in males, bear the [[stridulatory]] organs for the production of sound. The hind pair are membranous, folding fan-wise under the forewings. In many species the wings are not adapted for flight.<ref name=Resh/>

The largest members of the family are the {{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=on}}-long [[Brachytrupes|bull crickets]] (''[[Brachytrupes]]'') which excavate burrows a metre or more deep. The [[tree cricket]]s (Oecanthinae) are delicate white or pale green insects with transparent forewings while the [[field cricket]]s (Gryllinae) are robust brown or black insects.<ref name=Resh>{{cite book |author1= Resh, Vincent H. |author2= Card<U+00E9>, Ring T. |title=Encyclopedia of Insects |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Jk0Hym1yF0cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Encyclopedia+of+Insects&hl=en&sa=X&ei=EPJMVfOAE4eX7Qa5zYCABQ&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Grylloidea&f=false |year=2009 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-08-092090-0 |pages=232<U+2013>236}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
Crickets have a cosmopolitan distribution, being found in all parts of the world with the exception of cold regions at [[latitude]]s higher than about 55<U+00B0> North and South. They have colonised many large and small islands, sometimes flying over the sea to reach these locations, or perhaps conveyed on floating timber or by human activity. The greatest [[Biodiversity|diversity]] occurs in tropical locations, such as in Malaysia, where 88 species were heard chirping from a single location near [[Kuala Lumpur]]. There could have been a greater number than this present because some species are [[Muteness|mute]].<ref name=Resh/>

Crickets are found in many habitats. Members of several subfamilies are found in the upper [[Canopy (biology)|tree canopy]], in bushes and among grasses and herbs. They also occur on the ground and in caves, and some are subterranean, excavating shallow or deep burrows. Some make galleries in rotting wood, and certain beach-dwelling species can run and jump over the surface of pools.<ref name=Resh/>

==Biology==

===Defence===
Crickets are relatively defenceless, soft-bodied insects. Most species are [[nocturnal]] and spend the day hidden in cracks, under bark, inside curling leaves, under stones or fallen logs, in leaf litter or in the cracks in the ground that develop in dry weather. Some excavate their own shallow holes in rotting wood or underground and fold in their antennae to conceal their presence. Some of these burrows are temporary shelters, used for a single day, but others serve as more permanent residences and places for mating and laying eggs. Burrowing is performed by loosening the soil with the [[mandible]]s and then carrying it with the limbs, flicking it backwards with the hind legs or pushing it with the head.<ref name=Huber1989/>

Other [[antipredator adaptation|defensive strategies]] are the use of [[camouflage]], fleeing and [[aggression]]. Some species have adopted colourings, shapes and patterns that make it difficult for predators that hunt by sight to detect them. They tend to be dull shades of brown, grey and green that blend into their background, and desert species tend to be pale. Some species can fly but the mode of flight tends to be clumsy, so the most usual response to danger is to scuttle away to find a hiding place.<ref name=Huber1989/>

===Chirping===
[[File:Gryllus01.jpg|thumb|A male ''Gryllus'' cricket chirping. Its head faces its burrow; the leathery forewings ([[tegmen|tegmina]]) are raised (clear of the more delicate hindwings) and are being scraped against each other ([[stridulation]]) to produce the song. The burrow acts as a [[resonator]], amplifying the sound.]]
Most male crickets make a loud chirping sound by [[stridulation]] (a few species are mute). The stridulatory organ is located on the [[tegmen]], or forewing, which is leathery in texture. There is a large vein running along the centre of each tegmen, with comb-like [[serration]]s on its edge forming a file-like structure, and at the rear edge of the tegmen is a scraper. The tegmina are held at an angle to the body and rhythmically raised and lowered which causes the scraper on one wing to rasp on the file on the other. In the central part of the tegmen is the "harp". This is an area of thick, [[sclerotin]]ized membrane which resonates and amplifies the volume of sound, as does the pocket of air between the tegmina and the body wall. Most female crickets lack the necessary adaptations to stridulate, and these make no sound.<ref name=Chapman>{{cite book|author1=Chapman, R.F.|author2=Simpson, Stephen J. |author3=Douglas, Angela E.|title=The Insects: Structure and Function|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NXJEi8fo7CkC&pg=PA826 |year=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-11389-2 |pages=826<U+2013>833}}</ref>

There are several types of cricket song in the repertoire of some species. The calling song attracts females and repels other males, and is fairly loud. The courting song is used when a female cricket is near and encourages her to mate with the caller. A triumphal song is produced for a brief period after a successful mating, and may reinforce the mating bond to encourage the female to lay some eggs rather than find another male.<ref name=Berenbaum1996/> An aggressive song is triggered by contact [[chemoreceptor]]s on the antennae that detect the presence of another male cricket.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hardy, Tad N.; Shaw, Kenneth C. |year=1983 |title=The role of chemoreception in sex recognition by male crickets: ''Acheta domesticus'' and ''Teleogryllus oceanicus'' |journal=Physiological Entomology |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=151<U+2013>166 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3032.1983.tb00344.x }}</ref>

Crickets chirp at different rates depending on their species and the temperature of their [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Most species chirp at higher rates the higher the temperature is (approximately 62 chirps a minute at 13&nbsp;<U+00B0>C in one common species; each species has its own rate). The relationship between temperature and the rate of chirping is known as [[Dolbear's Law]]. According to this law, counting the number of chirps produced in 14 seconds by the [[Oecanthus fultoni|snowy tree cricket]], common in the [[United States]], and adding 40 will approximately equal the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.<ref name=Berenbaum1996>{{cite book|author=Berenbaum, May R. |title=Bugs in the System: Insects and Their Impact on Human Affairs |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-2XygvH9GBoC&pg=PA44 |year=1996 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02445-2 |pages=44<U+2013>45}}</ref>

[[File:Field cricket Gryllus pennsylvanicus.ogg|thumb|The calling song of a field cricket]]

In 1975, Dr. [[William H. Cade]] discovered that the [[parasitism|parasitic]] [[Tachinidae|tachinid]] [[fly]] ''[[Ormia ochracea]]'' is attracted to the song of the cricket, and uses it to locate the male in order to deposit her [[larva]]e on him. It was the first known example of a natural enemy that locates its host or prey using the mating signal.<ref>Cade, W. H. 1975. Acoustically orienting parasitoids: Fly phonotaxis to cricket song. Science 190: 1312-1313.</ref> Since then, many species of crickets have been found to be carrying the same parasitic fly, or related species. In response to this selective pressure, a mutation leaving males unable to chirp was observed amongst a population of [[Teleogryllus oceanicus|field crickets]] on the [[Hawaii]]an island of [[Kauai]], enabling these crickets to elude their [[parasitoid]] opponents.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tinghitella, R.M. |year=2008 |title=Rapid evolutionary change in a sexual signal: genetic control of the mutation 'flatwing' that renders male field crickets (''Teleogryllus oceanicus'') mute |journal=Heredity |volume=100 |pages=261<U+2013>267 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6801069 }}</ref>

===Flight===
Some species such as the ground crickets ([[Nemobiinae]]) are wingless, others have small forewings and no hind wings (''[[Copholandrevus]]''), others lack hind wings and have shortened forewings in females only, while others are macropterous, with the hind wings longer than the forewings. In ''[[Teleogryllus]]'', the proportion of macropterous individuals varies from very low to 100%. Probably most species with hind wings longer than forewings engage in flight.<ref name=Otte2007/>

Some species like ''[[Gryllus assimilis]]'' take off, fly and land efficiently and well, while other species are clumsy fliers.<ref name=Resh/> In some species, the hind wings are shed leaving wing stumps, usually after dispersal of the insect by flight. In other species they may be pulled off and consumed by the cricket itself or by another individual, probably providing a nutritional boost.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Walker, T.J. |year=1972 |title=Deciduous wings in crickets: a new basis for wing dimorphism |journal=Psyche |volume=79 |issue=4 |url=http://entomology.ifas.ufl.edu/Walker/buzz/k340lw72.pdf }}</ref>

''[[Gryllus firmus]]'' exhibits wing [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]; some individuals have fully functional, long hind wings and others have short wings and cannot fly. The short-winged females have smaller flight muscles, greater [[ovarian]] development and produce more eggs, so the polymorphism adapts the cricket for either dispersal or reproduction. In some long-winged individuals, the flight muscles deteriorate during adulthood and the insect's reproductive capabilities improve.<ref name=Devillers>{{cite book|author=Devillers, James |title=Juvenile Hormones and Juvenoids: Modeling Biological Effects and Environmental Fate |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4FDOBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA39 |year=2013 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-4665-1322-8 |pages=39}}</ref>

===Diet===
[[File:Crickets feeding on carrot.jpg|thumb|Two adult domestic crickets, ''[[Acheta domestica]]'', feeding on carrot]]

Captive crickets are [[Omnivore|omnivorous]]: when deprived of their natural diet, they will accept a wide range of different organic foodstuffs. Some species are completely [[Herbivore|herbivorous]], feeding on flowers, fruit and leaves, with ground-based species consuming seedlings, grasses, pieces of leaf and the shoots of young plants. Others are more [[Predation|predatory]] and include in their diet invertebrate eggs, larvae, pupae, moulting insects, [[scale insect]]s and [[aphid]]s.<ref name=Huber28/> Many are scavengers and consume various organic remains, decaying plants, seedlings and fungi.<ref name="cricket">{{cite web| url=http://insected.arizona.edu/cricketinfo.htm |publisher=University of Arizona |title=Cricket Information |accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> In captivity, many species have been successfully reared on a diet of ground up, commercial dry [[dog food]], supplemented with [[lettuce]] and aphids.<ref name=Huber28>{{cite book|author=Huber, Franz |title=Cricket Behavior and Neurobiology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nAP2LkQV0X0C&pg=PA28 |year=1989 |publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-2272-8 |page=28}}</ref>

Crickets have relatively powerful jaws, and several species have been known to bite humans.<ref>J.R.S.C. (1879). ''Journal of Horticulture and Practical Gardening, Volume 37'', p.503.</ref>

===Reproduction and life-cycle===

Male crickets establish their [[Dominance hierarchy|dominance]] over each other by aggression. They start by lashing each other with their antennae and flaring their mandibles. Unless one retreats at this stage, they resort to grappling, at the same time each emitting calls that are quite unlike those uttered in other circumstances. When one achieves dominance, it sings loudly while the loser remains silent.<ref name=Matthews/>

Females are generally attracted to males by their calls, though in non-stridulatory species, some other mechanism must be involved. After the pair have made antennal contact, there may be a courtship period during which the character of the call changes. The female mounts the male and a single [[spermatophore]] is transferred to the external genitalia of the female. Sperm flows from this into the female's [[oviduct]] over a period of a few minutes or up to an hour, depending on species. After [[copulation]] the female may remove or eat the spermatophore; males may attempt to prevent this with various ritualised behaviours. The female may mate on several occasions with different males.<ref name=Choe>{{cite book|author1= Choe, Jae C.|author2= Crespi, Bernard J.|title=The Evolution of Mating Systems in Insects and Arachnids |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=X3Iz-zXolVcC&pg=PA89 |year=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-58976-5 |pages=89<U+2013>105}}</ref>

[[File:Snodgrass Gryllus assimilis.png|thumb|Various [[instar]]s of ''[[Gryllus assimilis]]'', by [[Robert Evans Snodgrass]], 1930]]
Most crickets lay their eggs in the soil or inside the stems of plants, and to do this, female crickets have a long needle-like or scabre-like egg-laying organ called an [[ovipositor]]. Some ground-dwelling species have dispensed with this, either depositing their eggs in an underground chamber or pushing them into the wall of a burrow.<ref name=Resh/> The short-tailed cricket (''[[Anurogryllus]]'') excavates a burrow with chambers and a defecating area, lays its eggs in a pile on a chamber floor, and after the eggs have hatched, feeds the juveniles for about a month.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://entnemdept.ifas.ufl.edu/walker/buzz/g491a.htm |title=Genus Anurogryllus: Short-tailed crickets |author=Walker, T.J. |publisher=University of Florida |accessdate=14 May 2015}}</ref>

Crickets are [[Hemimetabolism|hemimetabolic]] insects, whose life cycle consists of an egg stage, a larval or [[Nymph (biology)|nymph]] stage that increasingly resembles the adult form as the nymph grows, and an adult stage. The egg hatches into a nymph about the size of a [[Drosophila|fruit fly]]. This passes through about ten larval stages, and with each successive [[Moulting|moult]] it become more like an adult. After the final moult, the genitalia and wings are fully developed, but a period of maturation is needed before the cricket is ready to breed.<ref name=Manning>{{cite book|author1=Manning, Aubrey |author2=Dawkins, Marian Stamp |title=An Introduction to Animal Behaviour|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=b3khAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA59 |year=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-37773-8 |pages=59<U+2013>60}}</ref>

===Inbreeding avoidance===

Female ''Teleogryllus oceanicus'' crickets from natural populations mate [[Polyandry|polyandrously]] and store sperm from multiple males.<ref>Simmons, L.W.; Beveridge, M.

Behav Ecol. 2010 21:1179-85. doi:10.1093/beheco/arg132</ref>  Female crickets exert a post-copulatory [[fertilization]] bias in favour of unrelated males to avoid the genetic consequences of [[Inbreeding depression|inbreeding]]. Fertilization bias depends on the control of sperm transport to the sperm storage organs. The inhibition of sperm storage by female crickets can act as a form of cryptic female choice to avoid the severe negative effects of inbreeding.<ref name="pmid23745826">{{vcite2 journal |vauthors=Tuni C, Beveridge M, Simmons LW |title=Female crickets assess relatedness during mate guarding and bias storage of sperm towards unrelated males |journal=J.

In controlled breeding experiments with the cricket ''Gryllus firmus'', seven inbred lines were tested, and it was found that during fourteen generations of brother<U+2013>sister matings nymphal weight and early [[fecundity]] declined substantially.<ref name=Roff>{{vcite2 journal |vauthors=Roff DA |title=Inbreeding depression: tests of the overdominance and partial dominance hypotheses |journal=Evolution |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=768<U+2013>75 |year=2002 |pmid=12038534 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  This observed inbreeding depression appeared to be due to an increased frequency of [[homozygous]] combinations of deleterious [[recessive allele]]s generated by the inbreeding (thereby decreasing fitness).<ref name=Roff />  These results support the general idea that the principal benefit of outcrossing is the masking of deleterious recessive alleles by wild-type alleles.<ref name="pmid3898363">{{vcite2 journal |vauthors=Bernstein H, Byerly HC, Hopf FA, Michod RE |title=Genetic damage, mutation, and the evolution of sex |journal=Science |volume=229 |issue=4719 |pages=1277<U+2013>81 |year=1985 |pmid=3898363 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Predators, parasites and pathogens===
Crickets have many natural enemies and are subject to various [[pathogen]]s and parasites. They are eaten by large numbers of vertebrate and invertebrate predators and their hard parts are often found when the contents of animal's guts are examined.<ref name=Huber1989/> [[Mediterranean house gecko]]s (''Hemidactylus turcicus'')  have learned that although a calling [[Gryllodes supplicans|decorated cricket]] (''Gryllodes supplicans'') may be safely-positioned out-of-reach in a burrow, female crickets attracted to the call can be intercepted and eaten.<ref name=Matthews>{{cite book|author1= Matthews, Robert W.|author2= Matthews, Janice R. |title=Insect Behavior |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HVz2Wztita8C&pg=PA319 |year=2009 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-90-481-2389-6 |pages=314<U+2013>319}}</ref>

[[File:Pterinochilus murinus sling.jpg|thumb|left|Crickets are reared as food for pets and zoo animals like this baboon spider, ''[[Pterinochilus murinus]]'', emerging from its den to feed]]

A phylogenetic study by Jost & Shaw in 2006 using sequences from 18S, 28S, and 16S [[Non-coding RNA|rRNA]] supported the monophyly of Ensifera. Most ensiferan families were also found to be monophyletic, and the superfamily Gryllacridoidea was found to include Stenopelmatidae, Anostostomatidae, Gryllacrididae and Lezina. Schizodactylidae and Grylloidea were shown to be sister taxa, and Rhaphidophoridae and Tettigoniidae were found to be more closely related to Grylloidea than had previously been thought. The authors stated that "a high degree of conflict exists between the molecular and morphological data, possibly indicating that much homoplasy is present in Ensifera, particularly in acoustic structures." They considered that tegmen stridulation and tibial tympanae are ancestral to Ensifera and have been lost on multiple occasions, especially within the Gryllidae.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jost, M.C,; Shaw, K.L. |year=2006 |title=Phylogeny of Ensifera (Hexapoda: Orthoptera) using three ribosomal loci, with implications for the evolution of acoustic communication |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=510<U+2013>530 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2005.10.004 }}</ref>

Crickets feature as major characters in novels and children's books. [[Charles Dickens]]'s 1845 novella ''[[The Cricket on the Hearth]]'', divided into sections called "Chirps", tells the story of a cricket which chirps on the hearth and acts as a [[guardian angel]] to a family.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kitton, Frederic G. |year=1900 |title=The Minor Writings of Charles Dickens |location=London |publisher=Elliot Stock |page=48}}</ref> [[Carlo Collodi]]'s 1883 children's book "Le avventure di Pinocchio" (''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'') featured "Il Grillo Parlante" (The [[Talking Cricket]]) as one of its characters.<ref>{{cite book| author=Collodi, Carlo |title=Le Avventure di Pinocchio | date=1883 |publisher=Biblioteca Universale Rizzoli}}</ref> [[George Selden (author)|George Selden's]] 1960 children's book ''[[The Cricket in Times Square]]'' tells the story of Chester the cricket from [[Connecticut]] who joins a family and their other animals, and is taken to see [[Times Square]] in New York.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Selden |first1=George |title=The Cricket in Times Square |date=1960 |publisher=Yearling |isbn=0-440-41563-2}}</ref> The story, which won the Newbery Honor,<ref>{{cite web |title=Newbery Medal and Honor Books, 1922-Present |url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberyhonors/newberymedal |publisher=American Library Association |accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref> came to Selden on hearing a real cricket chirp in Times Square.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060423081829/http://www.edupaperback.org/showauth.cfm?authid=155 | title=On-line biography of George Selden | publisher=The Educational Paperback Association | accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref>

The French entomologist [[Jean-Henri Fabre]]'s popular ''Souvenirs Entomoloqiques'' devotes a whole chapter to the cricket, discussing its construction of a burrow and its song-making. The account is mainly of the field cricket but also mentions the [[Oecanthus pellucens|Italian cricket]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fabre |first1=Jean-Henri |title=Fabre's Book of Insects -- Retold from Alexander Teixeira de Mattos' Translation of Fabre's "Souvenirs Entomologiques" |url=http://www.american-buddha.com/lit.fabreinsects.12.htm |accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>

Crickets have from time to time appeared in poetry. [[William Wordsworth]]'s 1805 poem ''The Cottager to Her Infant'' includes the couplet "The kitten sleeps upon the hearth, The crickets long have ceased their mirth".<ref>{{cite web |last=Wordsworth | first=William |title=The Cottager to her Infant |url=http://www.bartleby.com/145/ww283.html |publisher=Bartleby |accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref> [[John Keats]]'s 1819 poem ''[[Ode to Autumn]]'' includes the lines "Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft / The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft".<ref>{{cite web |last=Keats |first=John |title=Ode to Autumn |url=http://www.bartleby.com/106/255.html |publisher=Bartleby |accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref> The Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] poet [[Du Fu]] (712<U+2013>770) wrote a poem that in the translation by J. P. Seaton begins "House cricket... Trifling thing. And yet how his mournful song moves us. Out in the grass his cry was a tremble, But now, he trills beneath our bed, to share his sorrow."<ref>{{cite web |title=Tu Fu - translated by J.P.

[[Crickets as pets|Crickets are kept as pets]] and are considered good luck in some countries; in [[China]], they are sometimes kept in cages or in hollowed-out [[gourd]]s specially created in novel shapes.<ref>{{cite book |title=Insect Musicians & Cricket Champions: A Cultural History of Singing Insects in China and Japan |last=Ryan |first=Lisa Gail  |year=1996 |publisher=China Books |isbn=0-8351-2576-9 |page=30 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=25M5mMH4qfQC }}</ref> It is also common to have them as caged pets in some [[Europe]]an countries, particularly in the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

===As food===

Various species of crickets [[entomophagy|are a part of people's diets]] and are considered delicacies of high cuisine in certain countries. In [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]] and the southern part of [[Vietnam]], crickets are commonly eaten as a [[snack]], prepared by deep frying the soaked and cleaned insects.  In the [[United States of America]], farmed crickets are being incorporated into protein bars, baked goods, and protein powders aimed at consumers interested in losing weight or in reducing harm to the environment.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cricket-flour protein bars pass the taste test |url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/12/cricket-flour-protein-bars-pass-the-taste-test/index.htm |publisher=Consumer Reports |accessdate=10 May 2015 |date=10 December 2014}}</ref>
