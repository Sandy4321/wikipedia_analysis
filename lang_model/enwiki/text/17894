'''Jay Pritzker Pavilion''', also known as '''Pritzker Pavilion''' or '''Pritzker Music Pavilion''', is a [[bandshell]] in [[Millennium Park]] in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago]] in [[Cook County, Illinois]], United States. It is located on the south side of [[Randolph Street (Chicago)|Randolph Street]] and east of the [[Chicago Landmark]] [[Historic Michigan Boulevard District]]. The pavilion was named after [[Jay Pritzker]], whose [[Pritzker family|family]] is known for owning [[Hyatt Hotels]]. The building was designed by architect [[Frank Gehry]], who accepted the design commission in April 1999; the pavilion was constructed between June 1999 and July 2004, opening officially on July 16, 2004.

Pritzker Pavilion serves as the centerpiece for Millennium Park and is the new home of the [[Grant Park Symphony Orchestra|Grant Park Symphony Orchestra and Chorus]] and the [[Grant Park Music Festival]], the nation's only remaining free outdoor [[classical music]] series. It also hosts a wide range of music series and annual [[performing arts]] events. Performers ranging from [[mainstream rock]] bands to [[classical music]]ians and [[opera]] singers have appeared at the pavilion, which even hosts [[physical fitness]] activities such as [[yoga]]. All rehearsals at the pavilion are open to the public; trained guides are available for the music festival rehearsals, which are well-attended.

Millennium Park is part of the larger [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]]. The pavilion, which has a capacity of 11,000, is Grant Park's small event outdoor performing arts venue, and complements [[Petrillo Music Shell]], the park's older and larger bandshell. Pritzker Pavilion is built partially atop the [[Harris Theater (Chicago)|Harris Theater for Music and Dance]], the park's indoor performing arts venue, with which it shares a [[loading dock]] and backstage facilities. Initially the pavilion's lawn seats were free for all concerts, but this changed when [[Tori Amos]] performed the first rock concert there on August 31, 2005.

The construction of the pavilion created a legal controversy, given that there are historic limitations on the height of buildings in Grant Park. To avoid these legal restrictions, the city classifies the bandshell as a [[work of art]] rather than a building. With several design and assembly problems, the construction plans were revised over time, with features eliminated and others added as successful fundraising allowed the budget to grow. In the end, the performance venue was designed with a large fixed seating area, a Great Lawn, a [[Trellis (architecture)|trellis]] network to support the [[sound reinforcement system|sound system]] and a signature Gehry [[stainless steel]] headdress. It features a sound system with an acoustic design that replicates an indoor [[concert hall]] sound experience. The pavilion and Millennium Park have received recognition by critics, particularly for their [[accessibility]]; an accessibility award ceremony held at the pavilion in 2005 described it as "one of the most accessible parks&nbsp;<U+2013> not just in the United States but possibly the world".<ref name = "PVA"/>

The Jay Pritzker Pavilion is an outgrowth of a long-standing vision to create a world-class home for the [[Grant Park Music Festival]], which began in 1935 in the original Petrillo Music Shell.<ref>Macaluso, p. 8</ref> Lying between [[Lake Michigan]] to the east and the Loop to the west, [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] has been Chicago's front yard since the mid-19th century.

When the city first determined that a new pavilion should be built, the commission was supposed to go to [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]].<ref name=PaL/> The original pavilion design was much more modest than the structure that was eventually built, with a smaller shell structure and speakers affixed to poles interspersed throughout the seating area. However, two factors led to the cancellation of the original plans. First, the project's scope changed as a result of additional funds raised by [[John H. Bryan]], former [[CEO]] of the [[Sara Lee Corporation]]. The second factor was the intervention of the Pritzker family as potential donors. Unimpressed with the pavilion's original design, Cindy Pritzker "mandated that Frank Gehry be involved in its re-design".<ref name=JPMPSaGaiL>{{cite web|url=http://www.lares-lexicon.com/millenium/millenium.html|accessdate=2007-09-20|title=The Jay Pritzker Music Pavilion Sounds as Good as it Looks|publisher=LARES Associates|author=Delacoma, Wayne}}</ref> Jay Pritzker, a prominent Chicago businessman, had died in January 1999; his family own several businesses, including [[Hyatt Hotels]]. Jay and Cindy Pritzker had founded the [[Pritzker Prize]] in architecture in 1979, and the Pritzker family's Hyatt Foundation continues to award it annually.

In February 1999, the city announced it was negotiating with Gehry to design a [[proscenium]] arch and orchestra enclosure for a bandshell in the new park, as well as a [[pedestrian bridge]] over Columbus Drive (which became [[BP Pedestrian Bridge]]). The city sought donors to cover Gehry's work,<ref name=BffMasfp/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:ADHB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0ED0293A7773EBF9&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=The City|accessdate=2008-07-24|date=1999-02-18|publisher=NewsBank|work=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]}}</ref> and the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' dubbed him "the hottest architect in the universe" for his acclaimed [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]].

Millennium Park is built on top of a large underground [[parking garage]]. Construction started before the park's design was completed, and in January 2000, 17 additional [[Deep foundation|caissons]] had to be added to the partially built garage to support the weight of Gehry's pavilion. In April the tops of all these caissons had to be rebuilt for changes in the pavilion's foundation.<ref name = "flounders"/>

U.S. Equities Realty was responsible for negotiating contracts with Gehry and all [[General contractor|contractors]]. Walsh Construction and its [[subcontractor]]s were hired to execute three elements of Gehry's design: the structural steel supporting the stainless steel ribbons, the ribbons themselves and the trellis and associated sound system.<ref name=s18>Sharoff, p. 18</ref>

The LeJeune Steel Company of [[Minneapolis]] was the subcontractor for the structural steel.

The pavilion's construction was aided by the French [[CATIA]] software program and internet conferencing.<ref name=s27>Sharoff, p. 27</ref> Early plans to incorporate a surrounding [[waterfall]] and stairway were abandoned.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB4862A2DB2FB15&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=City Tweaks Millennium Park Design|accessdate=2008-07-24|date=2000-01-07|publisher=NewsBank|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Song, Lisa}}</ref> In the end, budget limitations led to compromises with the original architectural plan that left many elements in their most straightforward form, such as exposed pipes and conduits, or rough concrete.<ref name=s24>Sharoff, p. 24</ref>

=== Acoustics ===
[[File:20070919 Pritzker Pavilion speakers.JPG|thumb|upright|alt= A round, grey metal tube with two dark grey rectangular boxy speakers hanging from it. In the background are the tops of two skyscrapers. |Speakers close up]]
The Talaske Group of {{USCity|Oak Park|Illinois}}, was the subcontractor for Jay Pritzker Pavilion's [[LARES]] sound system,<ref name=s18/> which "generates the reflected and reverberant energy that surrounds and envelops the listener in an indoor performance venue".<ref name=JPMPSaGaiL/> The system, which effectively produces an even quality of sound throughout the entire venue, has received critical acclaim for its technological adaptations, such as signal processing in a variety of indoor and outdoor venues.<ref name=JPMPSaGaiL/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixfoundation.org/tec/1993.html|title=1993 TEC Awards|publisher=mixfoundation.org|accessdate=2009-09-21}}</ref> The Pritzker Pavilion is the first permanent outdoor installation of the LARES system in the United States.<ref name=JPMPSaGaiL/> The trellis has both acoustic and architectural functions; it allows for the precise placement of speakers for sound optimization without visual obstructions, while simultaneously providing a unifying visual canopy.<ref name=JPMPSaGaiL/>

The overall acoustic system is a distributed sound reinforcement system, which allows musicians on stage to hear each other clearly in a way that facilitates ensemble play. In addition, direct natural sound from the stage is reflected from architectural surfaces as well as being reinforced by two sound systems. The forward-facing reinforcement speakers time the relaying of sound so as to make it seem to have arrived directly from the stage with proper clarity and volume levels. Distributed speakers allow for lower sound volumes than would be necessary with centralized speakers, which would disturb neighboring residences and business.<ref name=JPMPSaGaiL/><ref name=JPP,MP>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/noise/docs/urbandes/16pritzkerpavillion.pdf|accessdate=2007-09-21|title=Jay Pritzker Pavilion, Millennium Park|format=PDF|publisher=Talaske|work=london.gov.uk|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070926061929/http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/noise/docs/urbandes/16pritzkerpavillion.pdf |archivedate = September 26, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

Instead of merely reinforcing the sound like a traditional public address system, the sound system on the trellis system seeks to replicate the acoustics of a concert hall, and create a clearly defined concert space.

The naming of Jay Pritzker Pavilion was a cause for protests. The new pavilion was built as a replacement for Grant Park's decades-old Petrillo Music Shell, which had a long history of hosting free music events and was named after [[James C. Petrillo]], a labor union leader who started free concerts in Grant Park. When the original bandshell was replaced and relocated a bit further north in Grant Park in 1978, the new structure retained the Petrillo name. In the early 2000s decade, the Petrillo family said naming the new music shell in Millennium Park after Jay Pritzker ignored Petrillo's legacy, and threatened legal action.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0FEA4948D70BB60A&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title='Pritzker' shell angers Petrillo kin&nbsp;<U+2013> Granddaughter may fight naming, OKd after $15 mil. gift|accessdate=2008-06-06|date=2003-10-30|publisher= NewsBank | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Herrmann, Andrew and Fran Spielman}}</ref><ref name = "steinberg">{{cite news | url = http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&p_topdoc=1&p_docnum=1&p_sort=YMD_date:D&p_product=NewsBank&p_text_direct-0=document_id=(%200FEA7F24A1764F67%20)&p_docid=0FEA7F24A1764F67&p_theme=aggregated5&p_queryname=0FEA7F24A1764F67&f_openurl=yes&p_nbid=R57A4CKKMTI2MzMwNDIzOS42NTUwMzU6MTo3OnJmLTg3MjU&&p_multi=CSTB | title = Time to face the music: No guarantee of immortality | publisher = NewsBank | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = 2003-10-31 | author = Steinberg, Neil | accessdate = 2010-01-12}}</ref> As of 2009, the Petrillo Music Shell was still in use, though ''Chicago Tribune'' arts critic Howard Reich described it as "dilapidated" and "dismal".<ref>{{cite news | url =http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=12BB5D88DBC880C8&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2| title = Creative thinking could save Chicago's music festivals | publisher = NewsBank | work = [[Chicago Tribune]] | date = 2009-11-01 | accessdate = 2010-01-12 | author = Reich, Howard}}</ref>
