'''''Uno''''' is an [[Xbox Live Arcade]] game based on the [[Uno (game)|''Uno'' card game]]. It was developed by [[Carbonated Games]] and released on [[May 9]], [[2006]]. The game is also included (as a download code) in the 12-month [[Xbox Live Vision]] [[Xbox 360]] package. A sequel, ''[[Uno Rush]]'' was announced at E3 2008.<ref name="e32008" />

==Gameplay==
The title is essentially a computerized version of the classic 4-player ''[[Uno (game)|Uno]]'' [[card game]].  The game offers three different game modes including Standard ''Uno'', Partner ''Uno'', and House Rules ''Uno''.  In Partner ''Uno'', players sitting across from each other join forces to form a team, so that a win by either player is a win for the team.  In House Rules ''Uno'', the rules can be tweaked and customized to the player's preference.

While only a single player can play at any point in time on a given console, ''Uno'' offers multiplayer for up to four players through [[Xbox Live]].  Players can join or drop-out of in-progress games at any time, with computer players automatically taking over for any missing humans.

Lastly, the title supports the [[Xbox Live Vision]] camera, allowing opponents to view an image of the player (or whatever the camera is pointed at) while playing the game. 

== Theme Decks ==
''Uno'' supports downloadable content through the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]]. This content takes the form of custom theme decks, which feature new visual appearances, sound effects, and game rules. Decks available for download from the Xbox Live Marketplace include:

* '''Project Gotham Racing Uno''': In this deck, the cards feature pictures of the cars seen in the [[Project Gotham Racing]] series of video games. The rule changes include a card called the "Gotham Live" card, which is based on the replay feature in ''[[Project Gotham Racing 3]]''. This card allows a player to look at the hand of any of the other players as well as functioning as a normal wild card.

* '''Kameo: Elements of Power Uno''': A custom deck with artwork from ''[[Kameo: Elements of Power]]''. In addition, a special play card allows a player to swap his or her entire hand with the hand of any other player in the game. 

* '''Uno 35th Anniversary''': A special deck made to celebrate the 35th Anniversary of the first edition of ''Uno'' released in the [[United States]] in 1971. In this deck, there are specialty "35" cards. If a "35" card is played only a 3 or 5 of any color can be played.

== Updates ==
The game itself was also updated on three separate occasions: 
*Support for the [[Xbox Live Vision]] camera.
*Support for the [[Scene_It%3F_Lights%2C_Camera%2C_Action#Big_Button_Pads|Big Button Pads]].
*Concentrated matchmaking pools for camera-enabled games.
