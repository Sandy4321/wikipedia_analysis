'''Stephen Grover Cleveland''' (March 18, 1837{{ndash}} June 24, 1908) was both the [[List of Presidents of the United States|22nd and 24th]] [[President of the United States|President]] of the [[United States]]. Cleveland is the only President to serve two non-consecutive terms (1885&ndash;1889 and 1893&ndash;1897) and therefore is the only individual to be counted twice in the numbering of the presidents. He was the winner of the [[Elections in the United States#Presidential elections|popular vote]] for President three times&mdash;in [[United States presidential election, 1884|1884]], [[United States presidential election, 1888|1888]], and [[United States presidential election, 1892|1892]]&mdash;and was the only [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] elected to the Presidency in the era of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political domination that lasted from 1860 to 1912. Cleveland's admirers praise him for his honesty, independence, integrity, and commitment to the principles of [[classical liberalism]].<ref>Jeffers, 8<U+2013>12; Nevins, 4<U+2013>5</ref>  As a leader of the [[Bourbon Democrats]], he opposed [[imperialism]], taxes, [[subsidy|subsidies]] and inflationary policies, but as a reformer he also worked against corruption, [[patronage]], and [[bossism]].

Some of Cleveland's actions caused controversy even within his own party. His intervention in the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894 in order to keep the railroads moving angered [[Trade union|labor unions]], and his support of the [[gold standard]] and opposition to [[free silver]] alienated the [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] wing of the Democrats.<ref name=tugwell>Tugwell, 220<U+2013>249</ref>  Furthermore, critics complained that he had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters&mdash;[[Depression (economics)|depressions]] and [[strike action|strikes]]&mdash;in his second term.<ref name=tugwell/>  Even so, his reputation for honesty and good character survived the troubles of his second term. Biographer [[Allan Nevins]] wrote, "in Grover Cleveland the greatness lies in typical rather than unusual qualities. He had no endowments that thousands of men do not have. He possessed honesty, courage, firmness, independence, and common sense. But he possessed them to a degree other men do not."<ref>Nevins, 4</ref>

==Family and early life==
===Childhood and family history===
Stephen Grover Cleveland was born on March 18, 1837 in [[Caldwell, New Jersey|Caldwell]], [[New Jersey]] to Richard Falley Cleveland and Ann Neal Cleveland.<ref>Nevins, 8<U+2013>10</ref>  Cleveland's father was a [[Presbyterian]] minister, originally from [[Connecticut]].<ref>Graff, 3<U+2013>4; Nevins, 8<U+2013>10</ref>  His mother (Judith Anderson) was from [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], the daughter of a bookseller.<ref name=graff3>Graff, 3<U+2013>4</ref>  On his father's side, Cleveland was descended from English ancestors, the first Cleveland having emigrated to [[Massachusetts]] from northeastern England in 1635.<ref>Nevins, 6</ref>  On his mother's side, Cleveland was descended from [[Anglo-Irish]] Protestants and [[German people|German]] [[Quaker]]s from Philadelphia.<ref>Nevins, 9</ref>  He was distantly related to General [[Moses Cleaveland]] after whom the city of [[Cleveland, Ohio]], was named.<ref>Graff, 7</ref>
[[Image:Grover Cleveland birthplace01.jpg|thumb|Cleveland's birthplace, in Caldwell, New Jersey]]

Cleveland was the fifth of nine children, five sons and four daughters.<ref name=graff3/>  He was named Stephen Grover in honor of the first pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Caldwell, where his father was pastor at the time, but he did not use the name ''Stephen'' in his adult life.<ref>Nevins, 10; Graff, 3</ref>  In 1841, the Cleveland family moved to [[Fayetteville, New York]], where Grover Cleveland spent much of his childhood.<ref>Nevins, 11; Graff, 8<U+2013>9</ref> Neighbors would later describe him as "full of fun and inclined to play pranks",<ref>Nevins, 11</ref> and fond of outdoor sports.<ref>Jeffers, 17</ref>  In 1850, Cleveland's father took a job in [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York]], and the family relocated there.<ref>Nevins, 17<U+2013>19</ref>  They moved again in 1853 to [[Holland Patent, New York]], near [[Utica, New York|Utica]].<ref name=nevins21>Nevins, 21</ref>  Not long after the family arrived in Holland Patent, Cleveland's father died.<ref name=nevins21/>

===Education and moving west ===
Cleveland's education began in grammar school at the Fayetteville Academy.<ref>Jeffers, 16<U+2013>17</ref>  When the family moved to Clinton, Cleveland was enrolled at the [[Clinton Liberal Academy]].<ref>Nevins, 18<U+2013>19; Jeffers, 19</ref>  After his father died in 1853, Cleveland left school and helped to support his family.<ref name=nevins23>Nevins, 23<U+2013>24</ref>  Later that year, Cleveland's brother William was hired as a teacher at the New York Institute for the Blind in [[New York City]], and William obtained a place for Cleveland as an assistant teacher.<ref name=nevins23/>  After teaching for a year, Cleveland returned home to Holland Patent at the end of 1854.<ref name=nevins27>Nevins, 27</ref>

Back in Holland Patent, the seventeen-year-old Cleveland looked for work unsuccessfully.<ref name=nevins27/>  An [[elder (Christianity)|elder]] in his church offered to pay for his college education if he would promise to become a minister, but Cleveland declined.<ref name=nevins27/>  Instead, the following spring Cleveland decided to make his way west to the city of [[Cleveland, Ohio]].<ref name=nevins27/>  He stopped first in [[Buffalo, New York]], where his uncle, Lewis W. Allen, lived. Allen dissuaded Cleveland from continuing west, and offered him a job arranging his [[Livestock]] herdbooks.<ref>Nevins, 28<U+2013>33</ref>  Allen was an important man in Buffalo, and he introduced his nephew to influential men there, including the partners in the [[law firm]] of Rogers, Bowen, and Rogers.<ref>Nevins, 31<U+2013>36; Graff, 10<U+2013>11</ref>  Cleveland later took a clerkship with the firm, and was admitted to the [[Bar association|bar]] in 1859.<ref name=graff14>Graff, 14</ref>

===Early career and the Civil War===
[[Image:PCLEV001-009.jpg|thumb|left|An early, undated photograph of Grover Cleveland<ref>From the Cleveland Family Papers at the New Jersey Archives.</ref>]]
After becoming a lawyer, Cleveland worked for the Rogers firm for three years, leaving in 1862 to start his own practice.<ref>Graff, 14<U+2013>15</ref>  In January 1863, he was appointed assistant [[district attorney]] of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]].<ref>Graff, 15; Nevins, 46</ref>  With the [[American Civil War]] raging, Congress passed the [[Conscription Act of 1863]], requiring able-bodied men to serve in the army if called upon, or else to hire a substitute.<ref name=graff14/>  Cleveland chose the latter course, paying George Benninsky, a thirty-two year-old [[Polish people|Polish]] immigrant, $150 to serve in his place.<ref>Graff, 14; Nevins, 51<U+2013>52. Benninsky survived the war.</ref>  As a lawyer, Cleveland became known for his single-minded concentration and dedication to hard work.<ref name=nevins52>Nevins, 52<U+2013>53</ref>  In 1866, he defended some participants in the [[Fenian raids#Niagara raid (1866)|Fenian raid]] of that year, doing so successfully and free of charge.<ref>Nevins, 54</ref>  In 1868, Cleveland attracted some attention within his profession for his successful defense of a [[libel]] suit against the editor of the ''Commercial Advertiser'', a Buffalo newspaper.<ref>Nevins, 54<U+2013>55</ref>  During this time, Cleveland lived simply in a [[boarding house]]; although his income grew sufficient to support a more lavish lifestyle, Cleveland continued to support his mother and younger sisters.<ref>Nevins, 55<U+2013>56</ref>  While his personal quarters were austere, Cleveland did enjoy an active social life and enjoyed "the easy-going sociability of hotel-lobbies and [[Western saloon|saloons]]."<ref>Nevins, 56</ref>

==Political career in New York==
===Sheriff of Erie County===
From his earliest involvement in politics, Cleveland had aligned himself with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref>Nevins, 44<U+2013>45</ref>  In 1865, he ran for [[District Attorney]], losing narrowly to his friend and roommate, [[Lyman K. Bass]], the Republican nominee.<ref name=nevins52/>  Cleveland then stayed out of politics until 1870 when, with the help of his friend, Oscar Folsom, he secured the Democratic nomination for [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] of Erie County.<ref name=nevins58>Nevins, 58</ref>  At the age of thirty-three, Cleveland found himself elected sheriff by a 303-vote margin, taking office on January 1, 1871.<ref>Jeffers, 33</ref>  While this new career took him away from the practice of law, it was rewarding in other ways: the fees were said to yield up to $40,000 over the two-year term.<ref name=nevins58/>  The most well-known incident of his term involved the [[Capital punishment in the United States|execution]] of a murderer, [[List of individuals executed in New York|Patrick Morrisey]], on September 6, 1872.<ref name=morrisey>Jeffers, 34; Nevins, 61<U+2013>62</ref>  Cleveland, as sheriff, was responsible for either personally carrying out the execution, or paying a deputy $10 to perform the task.<ref name=morrisey/> When subordinates refused, Cleveland once hanged a criminal in the [[Lafayette Square, Buffalo|Lafayette Square]] when it was still named Court House Square.<ref name=FDAROL>{{cite news|title=Familiar Downtown Area Retains Oldtime Laurels: Lafayetts Square, once Court House Square still center of activities|work=[[Buffalo Courier-Express]]|date=1934-09-30}}</ref>  Cleveland had qualms about the [[hanging]], but opted to carry out the duty himself.<ref name=morrisey/>  He hanged another murderer, [[List of individuals executed in New York|John Gaffney]], on February 14, 1873.<ref>{{cite web

After his term as sheriff ended, Cleveland returned to private practice, opening a law firm with his friends Lyman K. Bass and [[Wilson S. Bissell]].<ref>Jeffers, 36; Nevins, 64</ref>  Bass did not spend much time at the firm, being elected to Congress in 1873, but Cleveland and Bissell soon found themselves at the top of Buffalo's legal community.<ref>Nevins, 66<U+2013>71</ref>  Up to that point, Cleveland's political career had been honorable but unremarkable. As biographer [[Allan Nevins]] wrote, "probably no man in the country, on March 4, 1881, had less thought than this limited, simple, sturdy attorney of Buffalo that four years later he would be standing in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and taking the oath as President of the United States."<ref>Nevins, 78</ref>

===Mayor of Buffalo===
In the 1870s, the government of Buffalo had grown increasingly corrupt, with Democratic and Republican [[political machine]]s cooperating to share the [[Spoils system|spoils]].<ref>Nevins, 79; Graff, 18<U+2013>19; Jeffers, 42<U+2013>45; Welch, 24</ref>  When, in 1881, the Republicans nominated a slate of particularly disreputable machine politicians, the Democrats saw the opportunity to gain the votes of disaffected Republicans by nominating a more honest candidate.<ref>Nevins, 79<U+2013>80; Graff, 18<U+2013>19; Welch, 24</ref>  The party leaders approached Cleveland and he agreed to run for [[mayor]], provided that the rest of the ticket was to his liking.<ref name=nevins80>Nevins, 80<U+2013>81</ref>  When the more notorious politicians were left off the Democratic ticket, Cleveland accepted the nomination.<ref name=nevins80/>  Cleveland was elected [[List of mayors of Buffalo, New York|mayor]] with 15,120 votes, as against 11,528 for [[Milton C. Beebe]], his opponent.<ref>Nevins, 83</ref>  He took office January 2, 1882.

Cleveland's term as mayor was spent fighting the entrenched interests of the party machines.<ref>Graff, 19; Jeffers, 46<U+2013>50</ref>  Among the acts that established his reputation was a veto of the street-cleaning bill passed by the [[Buffalo Common Council|Common Council]].<ref name=street>Nevins, 84<U+2013>86</ref>  The street-cleaning contract was open for bids, and the Council selected the highest bidder, rather than the lowest, because of the political connections of the bidder.<ref name=street/>  While this sort of bipartisan graft had previously been tolerated in Buffalo, Mayor Cleveland would have none of it, and replied with a stinging veto message: "I regard it as the culmination of a most bare-faced, impudent, and shameless scheme to betray the interests of the people, and to worse than squander the public money".<ref>Nevins, 85</ref>  The Council reversed themselves and awarded the contract to the lowest bidder.<ref>Nevins, 86</ref>  For this, and several other acts to safeguard the public funds, Cleveland's reputation as an honest politician began to spread beyond Erie County.<ref>Nevins, 94<U+2013>95; Jeffers, 50<U+2013>51</ref>

===Governor of New York===

[[Image:DSCN4468 buffaloclevelandstatue e.jpg|right|thumb|Statue of Grover Cleveland outside City Hall in Buffalo, New York]]
As his reputation grew, state Democratic party officials began to consider Cleveland a possible nominee for governor.<ref name=nevins94>Nevins, 94<U+2013>99; Graff, 26<U+2013>27</ref>  [[Daniel Manning]], a party insider who admired Cleveland's record, promoted his candidacy.<ref>Nevins, 95<U+2013>101</ref>  With a split in the state Republican party, 1882 looked to be a Democratic year and there were several contenders for that party's nomination.<ref name=nevins94/>  The two leading Democratic candidates were [[Roswell P. Flower]] and [[Henry Warner Slocum|Henry W. Slocum]], but their factions deadlocked and the convention could not agree on a nominee.<ref>Graff, 26; Nevins, 101<U+2013>103</ref>  Cleveland, in third place on the first ballot, picked up support in subsequent votes and emerged as the compromise choice.<ref>Nevins, 103<U+2013>104</ref>  The Republican party remained divided against itself, and in the general election Cleveland emerged the victor, with 535,318 votes to Republican nominee [[Charles J. Folger]]'s 342,464.<ref>Nevins, 105</ref>  Cleveland's margin of victory was, at the time, the largest in a contested New York election, and the Democrats also picked up seats in both houses of the [[New York legislature|legislature]].<ref>Graff, 28</ref>

Continuing his opposition to unnecessary spending, Cleveland sent the legislature eight [[veto]]s in his first two months in office.<ref>Graff, 35</ref>  The first to attract attention was his veto of a bill to reduce the fares on [[History of the New York City Subway#Early steam and elevated railroads|New York City elevated trains]] to five cents.<ref>Graff, 35<U+2013>36</ref>  The bill had broad support because the el trains' owner, [[Jay Gould]], was unpopular and his fare increases were widely denounced.<ref>Nevins, 114<U+2013>116</ref>  Cleveland saw the bill as unjust<U+2014>Gould had taken over the railroads when they were failing and had made the system solvent again.<ref name=nevins116>Nevins, 116<U+2013>117</ref>  Moreover, Cleveland believed that altering Gould's franchise would violate the [[Contract Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution|federal Constitution]].<ref name=nevins116/>  Despite the initial popularity of the measure, the newspapers praised Cleveland's veto.<ref name=nevins116/>  [[Theodore Roosevelt]], then a member of the [[New York State Assembly|Assembly]], said that he had initially voted for the bill believing it was wrong, but wishing to punish the unscrupulous railroad barons.<ref name=nevins117>Nevins, 117<U+2013>118</ref>  After the veto, Roosevelt reversed himself, as did many legislators, and the veto was sustained.<ref name=nevins117/>

Cleveland's blunt, honest ways won him popular acclaim, but they also gained him the enmity of certain factions of his own party, especially the [[Tammany Hall]] organization in New York City.<ref>Nevins, 125<U+2013>126; Graff, 49<U+2013>51</ref>  Tammany, under its boss, [[John Kelly (U.S. politician)|John Kelly]], had not supported Cleveland's nomination as governor, and disliked him all the more when Cleveland openly opposed the re-election of one of their State Senators.<ref>Nevins, 133<U+2013>138</ref>  Losing Tammany's support was balanced, however, by gaining the support of Theodore Roosevelt and other reform-minded Republicans who helped Cleveland to pass several laws reforming municipal governments.<ref>Nevins, 138<U+2013>140</ref>

==Election of 1884==
{{main|United States presidential election, 1884}}
===Nomination for President===
[[Image:James G. Blaine - Brady-Handy.jpg|left|thumb|James G. Blaine, Cleveland's opponent in 1884]]
The Republicans convened in [[Chicago]] and nominated former Speaker of the House [[James G. Blaine]] of [[Maine]] for President on the fourth ballot. Blaine's nomination alienated many Republicans who viewed Blaine as ambitious and immoral.<ref name=nevins185>Nevins, 185<U+2013>186; Jeffers, 96<U+2013>97</ref>  Democratic party leaders saw the Republicans' choice as an opportunity to take back the White House for the first time since 1856 if the right candidate could be found.<ref name=nevins185/>

Among the Democrats, [[Samuel J. Tilden]] was the initial front-runner, having been the party's nominee in the [[United States presidential election, 1876|contested election of 1876]].<ref name=nevins146>Nevins, 146<U+2013>147</ref>  Tilden, however, was in poor health, and after he declined to be nominated, his supporters shifted to several other contenders.<ref name=nevins146/>  Cleveland was among the leaders in early support, but [[Thomas F. Bayard]] of [[Delaware]], [[Allen G. Thurman]] of [[Ohio]], and [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] of [[Massachusetts]] also had considerable followings, along with various [[favorite son]]s.<ref name=nevins146/>  Each of the other candidates had hindrances to his nomination: Bayard had spoken in favor of [[secession]] in 1861, making him unacceptable to Northerners; Butler, conversely, was reviled throughout the South for his actions during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]; Thurman was generally well-liked, but was growing old and infirm and his views on the [[Bimetallism|silver question]] were uncertain.<ref>Nevins, 147</ref>  Cleveland, too, had detractors<U+2014>Tammany remained opposed to him<U+2014>but the nature of his enemies made him still more friends.<ref>Nevins, 152<U+2013>153; Graff, 51<U+2013>53</ref>  Cleveland led on the first ballot, with 392 votes out of 820.<ref>Nevins, 153</ref>  On the second ballot, Tammany threw its support behind Butler, but the rest of the delegates shifted to Cleveland, and he was nominated.<ref name=nevins154>Nevins, 154; Graff, 53<U+2013>54</ref>  [[Thomas A. Hendricks]] of [[Indiana]] was selected as his running mate.<ref name=nevins154/>

===Campaign against Blaine===
[[Image:Blaine-tattoo5.jpg|thumb|right|An anti-Blaine cartoon presents him as the "tattooed man," with many indelible scandals.]]
[[Image:Ma ma wheres my pa.jpg|thumb|right|An anti-Cleveland cartoon highlights the Halpin scandal.]]

After Cleveland's nomination, reform-minded Republicans called "[[Mugwump]]s" denounced Blaine as corrupt and flocked to Cleveland.<ref name=mugwump>Nevins, 156<U+2013>159; Graff, 55</ref>  The Mugwumps, including such men as [[Carl Schurz]] and [[Henry Ward Beecher]], were more concerned with ideals than with party, and hoped that Cleveland would endorse their crusade for civil service reform and efficiency in government.<ref name=mugwump/>  At the same time that the Democrats gained support from the Mugwumps, they lost some to the [[United States Greenback Party|Greenback-Labor party]], led by ex-Democrat Benjamin Butler.<ref>Nevins, 187<U+2013>188</ref>

Each candidate's supporters cast aspersions on their opponents. Cleveland's supporters rehashed the old allegations that Blaine had corruptly influenced legislation in favor of the [[Little Rock & Fort Smith Railroad]] and the [[Northern Pacific Railway]], later profiting on the sale of bonds he owned in both companies.<ref name=blaine>Nevins, 159<U+2013>162; Graff, 59<U+2013>60</ref>  Although the stories of Blaine's favors to the railroads had made the rounds eight years earlier, this time Blaine's correspondence was discovered, making his earlier denials less plausible.<ref name=blaine/>  On some of the most damaging correspondence, Blaine had written "Burn this letter," giving Democrats the last line to their rallying cry: "Blaine, Blaine, James G. Blaine, the continental liar from the state of Maine, 'Burn this letter!"<ref>Graff, 59; Jeffers, 111; Nevins, 177, Welch, 34</ref>

To counter Cleveland's image of purity, his opponents reported that Cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child while he was a lawyer in Buffalo.<ref name=mama>Nevins, 162<U+2013>169; Jeffers, 106<U+2013>111; Graff, 60<U+2013>65; Welch, 36<U+2013>39</ref>  The derisive phrase "Ma, Ma, where's my Pa?" rose as an unofficial campaign slogan for those who opposed him.<ref name=mama/>  When confronted with the emerging scandal, Cleveland's instructions to his campaign staff were: "Tell the truth."<ref>Nevins, 163, Graff, 62</ref>  Cleveland admitted to paying child support in 1874 to Maria Crofts Halpin, the woman who claimed he fathered her child named Oscar Folsom Cleveland.<ref name=mama/>  Halpin was involved with several men at the time, including Cleveland's friend and law partner, Oscar Folsom, for whom the child was also named.<ref name=mama/>  Cleveland did not know which man was the father, and is believed to have assumed responsibility because he was the only bachelor among them.<ref name=mama/>

[[File:ElectoralCollege1884.svg|left|thumb|Results of the 1884 election]]
Both candidates believed that the states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and [[Connecticut]] would determine the election.<ref>Welch, 33</ref>  In New York, the [[Tammany Hall]], after vacillating, decided that they would gain more from supporting a Democrat they disliked than a Republican who would do nothing for them.<ref>Nevins, 170<U+2013>171</ref>  Blaine hoped that he would have more support from [[Irish American]]s than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine's mother was Irish Catholic, and he had been supportive of the [[Irish National Land League]] while he was Secretary of State.<ref>Nevins, 170</ref>  The Irish, a significant group in three of the [[swing state]]s, did appear inclined to support Blaine until one of his supporters, [[Samuel D. Burchard (clergyman)|Samuel D. Burchard]], gave a speech denouncing the Democrats as the party of "Rum, [[Romanism]], and Rebellion".<ref>Nevins, 181<U+2013>184</ref>  The Democrats spread the word of this insult in the days before the election, and Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states, including New York by just over one thousand votes.<ref name=leip1884>{{Leip PV source 2|year=1884| as of=January 27, 2008}}, {{National Archives EV source|year=1888| as of=January 27, 2008}}</ref>  While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219<U+2013>182.<ref name=leip1884/>  Following the electoral victory, the "Ma, Ma..." attack phrase gained a classic rejoinder: "Gone to the White House. Ha! Ha! Ha!"

==First term as President (1885&ndash;1889)==
===Reform===
[[Image:Cleveland Tariffs.jpg|thumb|Cleveland, portrayed as a tariff reformer]]
Soon after taking office, Cleveland was faced with the task of filling all of the government jobs for which the President had the power of appointment. These jobs were typically filled under the [[spoils system]], but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who was doing his job well, and would not appoint anyone based solely on party service.<ref>Nevins, 208<U+2013>211</ref>  He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers.<ref>Nevins, 214<U+2013>217</ref>  Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats.<ref>Graff, 83</ref>  While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.<ref>Nevins, 238<U+2013>241; Welch, 59<U+2013>60</ref>

Cleveland also reformed other parts of the government. In 1887 he signed an act creating the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]].<ref>Nevins, 354<U+2013>357; Graff, 85</ref>  He and [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[William C. Whitney]] undertook to modernize the [[United States Navy|navy]] and canceled construction contracts that had resulted in inferior ships.<ref>Nevins, 217<U+2013>223; Graff, 77</ref>  Cleveland angered railroad investors by ordering an investigation of western lands they held by government grant.<ref name=rrgrants>Nevins, 223<U+2013>228</ref> [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Lucius Q.C.

Cleveland faced a Republican Senate and often resorted to using his veto powers.<ref>Graff, 85</ref>  He vetoed hundreds of private pension bills for [[American Civil War]] veterans, believing that if their pensions requests had already been rejected by the [[Pensions Bureau]], Congress should not attempt to override that decision.<ref>Nevins, 326<U+2013>328; Graff, 83<U+2013>84</ref>  When Congress, pressured by the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], passed a bill granting pensions for disabilities not caused by military service, Cleveland also vetoed that.<ref>Nevins, 300<U+2013>331; Graff, 83</ref>  Cleveland used the veto far more often than any President up to that time.<ref>See [[List of United States presidential vetoes]]</ref>  In 1887, Cleveland issued his most well-known veto, [[s:Cleveland's Veto of the Texas Seed Bill|that of the Texas Seed Bill]].<ref name=nevins331>Nevins, 331<U+2013>332; Graff, 85</ref>  After a drought had ruined crops in several Texas counties, Congress appropriated $10,000 to purchase seed grain for farmers there.<ref name=nevins331/>  Cleveland vetoed the expenditure. In his veto message, he espoused a theory of limited government: "I can find no warrant for such an appropriation in the Constitution, and I do not believe that the power and duty of the general government ought to be extended to the relief of individual suffering which is in no manner properly related to the public service or benefit. A prevalent tendency to disregard the limited mission of this power and duty should, I think, be steadfastly resisted, to the end that the lesson should be constantly enforced that, though the people support the government, the government should not support the people. The friendliness and charity of our countrymen can always be relied upon to relieve their fellow-citizens in misfortune. This has been repeatedly and quite lately demonstrated. Federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character, while it prevents the indulgence among our people of that kindly sentiment and conduct which strengthens the bonds of a common brotherhood."<ref>{{cite book |title=The Writings and Speeches of Grover Cleveland

===Silver===

{{fixHTML|end}}
One of the most volatile issues of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by [[Bimetallism|gold and silver]], or by [[gold standard|gold alone]].<ref>Jeffers, 157<U+2013>158</ref>  The issue cut across party lines, with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver, and both parties' representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard.<ref name=nevins201>Nevins, 201<U+2013>205; Graff, 102<U+2013>103</ref>  Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply.<ref name=nevins201/>

Cleveland and [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Daniel Manning]] stood firmly on the side of the gold standard, and tried to reduce the amount of silver that the government was required to coin under the [[Bland-Allison Act]] of 1878.<ref>Nevins, 269</ref>  This angered Westerners and Southerners, who advocated for cheap money to help their poorer constituents.<ref>Nevins, 268</ref>  In reply, one of the foremost silverites, [[Richard P. Bland]], introduced a bill in 1886 that would require the government to coin unlimited amounts of silver, inflating the then-deflating currency.<ref name=nevins273>Nevins, 273</ref>  While Bland's bill was defeated, so was a bill the administration favored that would repeal any silver coinage requirement.<ref name=nevins273/>  The result was a retention of the status quo, and a postponement of the resolution of the free silver issue.<ref>Nevins, 277<U+2013>279</ref>

| style="text-align: left;" |"When we consider that the theory of our institutions guarantees to every citizen the full enjoyment of all the fruits of his industry and enterprise, with only such deduction as may be his share toward the careful and economical maintenance of the Government which protects him, it is plain that the exaction of more than this is indefensible extortion and a culpable betrayal of American fairness and justice... The public Treasury, which should only exist as a conduit conveying the people's tribute to its legitimate objects of expenditure, becomes a hoarding place for money needlessly withdrawn from trade and the people's use, thus crippling our national energies, suspending our country's development, preventing investment in productive enterprise, threatening financial disturbance, and inviting schemes of public plunder."

Another contentious financial issue at the time was the [[protective tariff]]. While it had not been a central point in his campaign, Cleveland's opinion on the tariff was that of most Democrats: that the tariff ought to be reduced.<ref name=nevins280>Nevins, 280<U+2013>282, Reitano, 46<U+2013>62</ref>  Republicans generally favored a high tariff to protect American industries.<ref name=nevins280/>  American tariffs had been high since the Civil War, and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue that the government was running a surplus.<ref>Nevins, 286<U+2013>287</ref>

In 1886, a bill to reduce the tariff was narrowly defeated in the House.<ref>Nevins, 287<U+2013>288</ref>  The tariff issue was emphasized in [[United States House elections, 1886|the Congressional elections that year]], and the forces of protectionism increased their numbers in the Congress.<ref>Nevins, 290<U+2013>296; Graff, 87<U+2013>88</ref>  Nevertheless, Cleveland continued to advocate tariff reform. As the surplus grew, Cleveland and the reformers called for a tariff for revenue only.<ref>Nevins, 370<U+2013>371</ref>  His message to Congress in 1887 (quoted at left) pointed out the injustice of taking more money from the people than the government needed to pay for its operating expenses.<ref>Nevins, 379<U+2013>381</ref>  Republicans, as well as protectionist northern Democrats like [[Samuel J. Randall]], believed that without high tariffs American industries would fail, and continued to fight reformers' efforts.<ref>Nevins, 383<U+2013>385</ref>  [[Roger Q. Mills]], the chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means, proposed a bill that would reduce the tariff burden from about 47% to about 40%.<ref name=graff88>Graff, 88<U+2013>89</ref>  After significant exertions by Cleveland and his allies, the bill passed the House.<ref name=graff88/>  The Republican Senate, however, failed to come to agreement with the Democratic House, and the bill died in the [[United States Congress Conference committee|conference committee]]. Dispute over the tariff would carry over into the 1888 Presidential election.

===Foreign policy===
Cleveland was a committed non-interventionist who had campaigned in opposition to expansion and imperialism. He refused to promote the previous administration's [[Nicaragua]] canal treaty, and generally was less of an expansionist in foreign relations.<ref>Nevins, 205; 404<U+2013>405</ref>  Cleveland's [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Thomas F. Bayard]], negotiated with [[Joseph Chamberlain]] of the United Kingdom over fishing rights in the waters off Canada, and struck a conciliatory note, despite the opposition of [[New England]]'s Republican Senators.<ref>Nevins, 404<U+2013>413</ref>  Cleveland also withdrew from Senate consideration the [[Berlin Conference|Berlin Conference treaty]] which guaranteed an open door for U.S. interests in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|the Congo]].<ref name=wealth>Zakaria, 80</ref>

[[Image:President cleveland wedding.png|left|thumb|Grover Cleveland and Frances Folsom were married in the Blue Room of the White House.]]

===Marriage===
Cleveland entered the White house as a bachelor, but did not remain one for long. In 1885, the daughter of Cleveland's friend Oscar Folsom visited him in Washington.<ref name=graff78>Graff, 78</ref> [[Frances Folsom Cleveland|Frances Folsom]] was a student at [[Wells College]], and when she returned to school Cleveland received her mother's permission to correspond with her.<ref name=graff78/> They were soon engaged to be married.<ref name=graff78/>
On June 2, 1886, Cleveland married Frances in the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]] in the White House.<ref>Graff, 79</ref> He was the second President to marry while in office, and the only President to have a wedding in the White House.<ref>The previous President to marry during his term was [[John Tyler]]. Graff, 80</ref>  This marriage was unusual because Cleveland was the executor of Oscar Folsom's estate and had supervised Frances' upbringing, but the public did not, in general, take exception to the match.<ref>Jeffers, 170<U+2013>176; Graff, 78<U+2013>81; Nevins, 302<U+2013>308; Welch, 51</ref>  At twenty-one years old, Frances was the youngest [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] in American history, but the public soon warmed to her beauty and warm personality.<ref>Graff, 80<U+2013>81</ref>  The Clevelands had five children: [[Ruth Cleveland|Ruth]] (1891<U+2013>1904); [[Esther Cleveland|Esther]] (1893<U+2013>1980); Marion (1895<U+2013>1977); Richard Folsom (1897<U+2013>1974); and Francis Grover (1903<U+2013>1995).  The British philosopher [[Philippa Foot]] was their granddaughter.

===Supreme Court appointments===
[[Image:Melville Weston Fuller Chief Justice 1908.jpg|125px|thumb|Chief Justice Melville Fuller]]
Cleveland successfully appointed two Justices to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. The first, [[Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar (II)|Lucius Q.C. Lamar]], was a former [[Mississippi]] Senator then serving in Cleveland's Cabinet as Interior Secretary. When [[William Burnham Woods]] died, Cleveland nominated Lamar to his seat in late 1887.<ref name=nevins399>Nevins, 339</ref>  While Lamar had been well-liked as a Senator, his service under the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] two decades earlier caused many Republicans to vote against him.<ref name=nevins399/>  Lamar's nomination was confirmed by the narrow margin of 32 to 28.<ref name=nevins399/>

[[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Morrison Waite]] died a few months later, and Cleveland nominated [[Melville Fuller]] to his seat on April 30, 1888.<ref name=nevins445>Nevins, 445<U+2013>447</ref>  Cleveland had previously offered to nominate Fuller to the [[Civil Service Commission]], but Fuller declined to leave his Chicago law practice.<ref>Nevins, 250</ref>  Fuller accepted the Supreme Court nomination, and the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] spent several months examining the little-known nominee.<ref name=nevins445/>  Finding him acceptable, the Senate confirmed the nomination 41 to 20.<ref name=nevins445/>

===President Cleveland on Vacation===

President Cleveland, the First Lady and their entourage visited Florida in February 1888. Their itinerary included Charleston SC, [[Savannah,_Georgia]] and then the Florida cities of [[Jacksonville,_Florida]](where they attended the Sub Tropical Expo,
St. Augustine (where they were guests of [[Henry_Flagler]]), Titusville, Rockledge, and [[Winter_Park,_Florida]]. They were well received in the South with many fun packed and memorable events. This trip helped him win the popular vote in the South later that year. But not the all important electoral vote. The President became quite fond of Florida and returned many times after his
administration. During which he also helped pass a bill in congress to have the Cape Canaveral Lighthouse moved back from the
shoreline.

{{main|United States presidential election, 1888}}
The debate over tariff reduction continued into the 1888 presidential campaign.<ref name=nevins418>Nevins, 418<U+2013>420</ref> 

The Republicans nominated [[Benjamin Harrison]] of [[Indiana]] for President and [[Levi P. Morton]] of New York for Vice President. Cleveland was easily renominated at the Democratic convention in [[St. Louis]].<ref name=graff90>Graff, 90<U+2013>91</ref>  Vice President [[Thomas A. Hendricks|Hendricks]] having died in 1885, the Democrats chose [[Allen G. Thurman]] of Ohio to be Cleveland's running mate.<ref name=graff90/>  The Republicans campaigned heavily on the tariff issue, turning out protectionist voters in the important industrial states of the North.<ref name=nevins418/>  Further, the Democrats in New York were divided over the gubernatorial candidacy of [[David B. Hill]], weakening Cleveland's support in that swing state.<ref>Nevins, 423<U+2013>427</ref>

As in 1884, the election focused on the swing states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Indiana. Unlike that year, when Cleveland triumphed in all four, in 1888 he won only two, losing his home state of New York by 14,373 votes.<ref name=leip1888>{{Leip PV source 2|year=1888| as of=February 18, 2008}}, {{National Archives EV source|year=1888| as of=February 18, 2008}}</ref>  More notoriously, the Republicans were victorious in Indiana, largely as the result of fraud.<ref>Nevins, 435<U+2013>439; Jeffers, 220<U+2013>222; Goldman, 143<U+2013>144; see also [[Blocks of Five]].</ref>  Republican victory in that state, where Cleveland lost by just 2,348 votes, was sufficient to propel Harrison to victory, despite his loss of the nationwide popular vote.<ref name=leip1888/>  Cleveland continued his duties diligently until the end of the term and began to look forward to return to private life.<ref>Nevins, 443<U+2013>449</ref>

===Private citizen for four years===
As Frances Cleveland left the White House, she told a staff member, "Now, Jerry, I want you to take good care of all the furniture and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now, when we come back again." When asked when she would return, she responded, "We are coming back four years from today."<ref>Nevins, 448</ref>  In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, [[Francis Lynde Stetson|Stetson]], Tracy, and MacVeigh, a predecessor to the current firm [[Davis Polk & Wardwell]].<ref>Nevins, 450.</ref>  Cleveland's income with the firm was not high, but neither were his duties especially onerous.<ref>Nevins, 450<U+2013>452</ref> While they lived in New York, the Clevelands' first child, Ruth, was born in 1891.<ref>Nevins, 450; Graff, 99<U+2013>100</ref>

The Harrison administration worked with Congress to pass the [[McKinley Tariff]] and the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]], two policies Cleveland deplored as dangerous to the nation's financial health.<ref>Graff, 102<U+2013>105; Nevins, 465<U+2013>467</ref>  At first he refrained from criticizing his successor, but by 1891 Cleveland felt compelled to speak out, addressing his concerns in an open letter to a meeting of reformers in New York.<ref>Graff, 104<U+2013>105; Nevins, 467<U+2013>468</ref>  The "silver letter" thrust Cleveland's name back into the spotlight just as the 1892 election was approaching.<ref>Nevins, 470<U+2013>471</ref>

==Election of 1892==
{{main|United States presidential election, 1892}}
===Democratic nomination===
Cleveland's stature as an ex-President and recent pronouncements on the monetary issues made him a leading contender for the Democratic nomination.<ref>Nevins, 468<U+2013>469</ref>  His leading opponent was [[David B. Hill]], who was by that time a Senator for New York.<ref name=nevins470>Nevins, 470<U+2013>473</ref>  Hill united the anti-Cleveland elements of the Democratic party<U+2014>silverites, protectionists, and Tammany Hall<U+2014>but was unable to create a coalition large enough to deny Cleveland the nomination.<ref name=nevins470/>  Despite some desperate maneuvering by Hill, Cleveland was nominated on the first ballot at the [[1892 Democratic National Convention|convention]] in Chicago.<ref>Nevins, 480<U+2013>491</ref>  For Vice President, the Democrats chose to balance the ticket with [[Adlai E. Stevenson I|Adlai E. Stevenson]] of Illinois, a silverite.<ref>Graff, 105; Nevins, 492<U+2013>493</ref>

===Campaign against Harrison===
[[File:ElectoralCollege1892.svg|thumb|Results of the 1892 election]]
The Republicans renominated President Harrison, making the 1892 election a rematch of the one four years earlier. Unlike the elections of 1884 and 1888, the 1892 election was "the cleanest, quietest, and most creditable in the memory of the post-war generation",<ref>Nevins, 498</ref> in part because Harrison's wife, Caroline, was dying of tuberculosis.<ref>Calhoun, 149</ref> Harrison didn't personally campaign and Cleveland followed suit.  The issue of the tariff had worked to the Republicans' advantage in 1888, but the revisions of the past four years had made imported goods so expensive that now many voters shifted to the reform position.<ref>Nevins, 499</ref>  Many westerners, traditionally Republican voters, defected to the new [[Populist Party]] candidate, [[James Weaver]], who promised free silver, generous veterans' pensions, and an [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]].<ref>Graff, 106<U+2013>107; Nevins, 505<U+2013>506</ref>  Finally, the Tammany Hall Democrats adhered to the national ticket, allowing a united Democratic party to carry New York.<ref>Graff, 108</ref>  The result was a victory for Cleveland by wide margins in both the popular and electoral votes.<ref>{{Leip PV source 2|year=1892| as of=February 22, 2008}}, {{National Archives EV source|year=1892| as of=February 22, 2008}}</ref>

==Second term as President (1893&ndash;1897)==
===Economic panic and the silver issue===
[[Image:Gorman.jpg|thumb|right|Cleveland's humiliation by Gorman and the sugar trust]]

Shortly after Cleveland's second term began, the [[Panic of 1893]] struck the stock market, and he soon faced an acute [[economic depression]].<ref>Graff, 114</ref>  The panic was worsened by the acute shortage of gold that resulted from the free coinage of silver, and Cleveland called Congress into session early to deal with the problem.<ref name=nevins526>Nevins, 526<U+2013>528</ref>  The debate over the coinage was as heated as ever, but the effects of the panic had driven more moderates to support repealing the free coinage provisions of the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]].<ref name=nevins526/>  Even so, the silverites rallied their following at a convention in Chicago, and the House of Representatives took fifteen weeks of debate before passing the repeal by a considerable margin.<ref>Nevins, 524<U+2013>528, 537<U+2013>540. The vote was 239 to 108.</ref>  In the Senate, the repeal of free coinage was equally contentious, but Cleveland convinced enough Democrats to stand by him that they, along with eastern Republicans, formed a 48<U+2013>37 majority.<ref>Nevins, 541<U+2013>548</ref>  With the passage of the repeal, the Treasury's gold reserves were restored to safe levels.<ref>Graff, 115</ref>  At the time the repeal seemed a minor setback to silverites, but it marked the beginning of the end of silver as a basis for American currency.<ref>{{cite book |title=Monetary Policy in the United States: An Intellectual and Institutional History |last=Timberlake|first=Richard H. |year=1993 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0226803848 |page=179}}</ref>

===Tariff reform===
Having succeeded in reversing the Harrison administration's silver policy, Cleveland sought next to reverse the effects of the [[McKinley tariff]]. What would become the [[Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act]] was introduced by West Virginian Representative [[William L. Wilson]] in December 1893.<ref>Nevins, 565</ref>  After lengthy debate, the bill passed the House by a considerable margin.<ref>Nevins, 567. The vote was 204 to 140</ref>  The bill proposed moderate downward revisions in the tariff, especially on raw materials.<ref name=nevins564>Nevins, 564<U+2013>566; Jeffers, 285<U+2013>287</ref>  The shortfall in revenue was to be made up by an [[income tax]] of two percent on incomes in excess of $4,000.<ref name=nevins564/>

The bill was next considered in the Senate, where opposition was stronger.<ref name=nevins567>Nevins, 567<U+2013>569</ref>  Many Senators, led by [[Arthur Pue Gorman]] of [[Maryland]], wanted more protection for their states' industries than the Wilson bill allowed.<ref name=nevins567/>  Others, such as Morgan and Hill, opposed partly out of a personal enmity to Cleveland.<ref name=nevins567/>  By the time the bill left the Senate, it had more than 600 amendments attached that nullified most of the reforms.<ref>Nevins, 572<U+2013>576. The income tax component of the Wilson-Gorman Act was partially ruled unconstitutional in 1895. ''See [[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.]]''</ref>  The [[American Sugar Refining Company|Sugar Trust]] in particular lobbied for changes that favored it at the expense of the consumer.<ref>Nevins, 577<U+2013>578</ref>  Cleveland was unhappy with the result, and denounced the revised measure as a disgraceful product of the control of the Senate by trusts and business interests.<ref>Nevins, 585<U+2013>587; Jeffers, 288<U+2013>289</ref>  Even so, he believed it was an improvement over the McKinley tariff and allowed it to become law without his signature.<ref>Nevins, 587<U+2013>588; Graff, 117</ref>

[[Image:John t morgan.jpg|left|thumb|[[John Tyler Morgan|John T. Morgan]], Senator from [[Alabama]], opposed Cleveland on free silver, the tariff, and the Hawaii treaty, saying of Cleveland that "I hate the ground that man walks on."<ref>Nevins, 568</ref>]]

===Labor unrest===
The Panic of 1893 had damaged labor conditions across the United States, and the victory of anti-silver legislation worsened the mood of western laborers.<ref name=coxey>Graff, 117<U+2013>118; Nevins, 603<U+2013>605</ref>  A group of workingmen led by [[Jacob S. Coxey]] began to march east toward Washington, D.C. to protest Cleveland's policies.<ref name=coxey/>  This group, known as [[Coxey's Army]], agitated in favor of a national roads program to give jobs to workingmen, and a weakened currency to help farmers pay their debts.<ref name=coxey/>  By the time they reached Washington, only a few hundred remained and when they were arrested the next day for walking on the grass of the [[United States Capitol]], the group scattered.<ref name=coxey/>  Coxey's Army was never a threat to the government, but it showed a growing dissatisfaction in the West with Eastern monetary policies.<ref>Graff, 118; Jeffers, 280<U+2013>281</ref>

The [[Pullman Strike]] had a significantly greater impact than Coxey's Army. A strike began against the [[Pullman Company]], and sympathy strikes, encouraged by [[American Railway Union]] leader [[Eugene V. Debs]], soon followed.<ref>Nevins, 611<U+2013>613</ref>  By June 1894, 125,000 railroad workers were on strike, paralyzing the nation's commerce.<ref>Nevins, 614</ref>  Because the railroads carried the [[U.S. Postal Service|mail]], and because several of the affected lines were in [[Bankruptcy in the United States|federal receivership]], Cleveland believed a federal solution was appropriate.<ref>Nevins, 614<U+2013>618; Graff, 118<U+2013>119; Jeffers, 296<U+2013>297</ref>  Cleveland obtained an [[injunction]] in federal court and when the strikers refused to obey it, he sent in federal troops to [[Chicago]] and other rail centers.<ref>Nevins, 619<U+2013>623; Jeffers, 298<U+2013>302. See also ''[[In re Debs]]''.</ref>  Leading newspapers of both parties applauded Cleveland's actions, but the use of troops hardened the attitude of organized labor toward his administration.<ref>Nevins, 624<U+2013>628; Jeffers, 304<U+2013>305; Graff, 120</ref>

In January 1893, a group of Americans living in [[Hawai'i]] [[Kingdom of Hawaii#Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai'i|overthrew]] Queen [[Liliuokalani]] and established a provisional government under [[Sanford Dole]].<ref name=nevins549>Nevins, 549<U+2013>552; Graff 121<U+2013>122</ref>  By February, the Harrison administration had agreed with representatives of the new government on a treaty of annexation and submitted it to the Senate for approval.<ref name=nevins549/>  Five days after taking office, Cleveland withdrew the treaty from the Senate and sent former Congressman [[James Henderson Blount]] to Hawai'i to investigate the conditions there.<ref name=blount>Nevins, 552<U+2013>554; Graff, 122</ref>

In his first term, Cleveland had supported free trade with Hawai'i and accepted an amendment that gave the United States a coaling and naval station in [[Pearl Harbor]].<ref name=wealth/>  Now, however, Cleveland agreed with Blount's report, which found the populace to be opposed to annexation.<ref name=blount/>  Liliuokalani refused to grant amnesty as a condition of her reinstatement and said she would execute the current government in Honolulu, and Dole's government refused to yield their position.<ref name=nevins558>Nevins, 558<U+2013>559</ref>  By December 1893, the matter was still unresolved, and Cleveland referred the issue to Congress.<ref name=nevins558/>  In his message to Congress, Cleveland rejected the idea of annexation and encouraged the Congress to continue the American tradition of non-intervention (see excerpt at right).<ref name=nevins560/>  Many in Congress, led by Senator [[John Tyler Morgan]] favored annexation, and the [[Morgan Report|report]] Congress eventually issued favored neither annexation of Hawaii nor the use of American force to restore the Hawaiian monarch.<ref>Graff, 123</ref>

[[Image:Grover Cleveland, painting by Anders Zorn.jpg|right|thumb|Oil painting of Grover Cleveland, painted in 1899 by [[Anders Zorn]].]]
Closer to home, Cleveland adopted a broad interpretation of the [[Monroe Doctrine]] that did not just simply forbid new European colonies but declared an American interest in any matter within the hemisphere.<ref name=wealth2>Zakaria, 145<U+2013>146</ref>  When Britain and [[Venezuela]] disagreed over the boundary between the latter nation and [[British Guiana]], Cleveland and Secretary of State [[Richard Olney]] pressured Britain into agreeing to arbitration.<ref>Graff, 123<U+2013>125; Nevins, 633<U+2013>642</ref>  A tribunal convened in [[Paris]] in 1898 to decide the matter, and issued its award in 1899.<ref>Graff, 125</ref>  The tribunal awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to British Guiana.<ref>Nevins, 647</ref>  By standing with a Latin American nation against the encroachment of a colonial power, Cleveland improved relations with the United States' southern neighbors, but the cordial manner in which the negotiations were conducted also made for good relations with Britain.<ref>Nevins, 550, 647<U+2013>648</ref>

===Cancer===
In the midst of the fight for repeal of free silver coinage in 1893, Cleveland sought the advice of the White House doctor, Dr O'Reilly about soreness on the roof of his mouth and a crater-like edge ulcer with a granulated surface on the left side of Cleveland's [[hard palate]]. Samples of the tumor were sent anonymously to the army medical museum.  The prognosis was not a [[malignant]] [[cancer]] but ''[[epithelioma]]''.<ref name="Renehan">{{cite journal

Because of the financial depression of the country, Cleveland decided to have surgery performed in secrecy to avoid further market panic.<ref>Nevins, 528<U+2013>529; Graff, 115<U+2013>116</ref>  The surgery occurred on July 1, to give Cleveland time to make a full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session.<ref>Nevins, 531<U+2013>533</ref>  Under the guise of a vacation cruise, Cleveland and his surgeon, Dr. Joseph Bryant, left for [[New York]]. The surgeons operated aboard the yacht ''Oneida'' as it sailed off [[Long Island]].<ref>Nevins, 529</ref>  The surgery was conducted through the President's mouth, to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery.<ref name=nevins530>Nevins, 530<U+2013>531</ref>  The team, sedating Cleveland with [[nitrous oxide]] and [[Diethyl ether|ether]], successfully removed parts of his [[Maxilla|upper left jaw]] and hard palate.<ref name=nevins530/>  The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland's mouth disfigured.<ref name=nevins532>Nevins, 532<U+2013>533</ref>  During another surgery, an [[Orthodontics|orthodontist]] fitted Cleveland with a hard rubber prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance.<ref name=nevins532/>

A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated.<ref>Nevins, 533; Graff, 116</ref>  Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation, the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland's vacation.<ref name=nevins532/>  In 1917, one of the surgeons present on the ''Oneida,'' Dr. William W. Keen, wrote an article detailing the operation.<ref name="Keen"/>

===Supreme Court appointments===
[[Image:DavidBHill.jpg|thumb|The objections of Senator [[David B. Hill]] defeated two of Cleveland's Supreme Court nominees.]]
Cleveland's trouble with the Senate hindered the success of his nominations to the Supreme Court in his second term. In 1893, after the death of [[Samuel Blatchford]], Cleveland nominated [[William B. Hornblower]] to the Court.<ref name=nevins569>Nevins, 569<U+2013>570</ref>  Hornblower, the head of a New York City law firm, was thought to be a qualified appointee, but his campaign against a New York machine politician had made Senator [[David B. Hill]] his enemy.<ref name=nevins569/>  Further, Cleveland had not consulted the Senators before naming his appointee, leaving many who were already opposed to Cleveland on other grounds even more aggrieved.<ref name=nevins569/>  The Senate rejected Hornblower's nomination on January 15, 1894, by a vote of 24 to 30.<ref name=nevins569/>

Cleveland continued to defy the Senate by next appointing [[Wheeler Hazard Peckham]] another New York attorney who had opposed Hill's machine in that state.<ref name=nevins570>Nevins, 570<U+2013>571</ref>  Hill used all of his influence to block Peckham's confirmation, and on February 16, 1894, the Senate rejected the nomination by a vote of 32 to 41.<ref name=nevins570/>  Reformers urged Cleveland to continue the fight against Hill and to nominate [[Frederic Ren<U+00E9> Coudert, Sr.|Frederic R. Coudert]], but Cleveland acquiesced in an inoffensive choice, that of Senator [[Edward Douglass White]] of [[Louisiana]], whose nomination was accepted unanimously.<ref name=nevins570/>  Later, in 1896, another vacancy on the Court led Cleveland to consider Hornblower again, but he declined to be nominated.<ref name=nevins572>Nevins, 572</ref>  Instead, Cleveland nominated [[Rufus Wheeler Peckham]], the brother of Wheeler Hazard Peckham, and the Senate confirmed the second Peckham easily.<ref name=nevins572/>

==Later life and death==
[[Image:Grover Cleveland portrait2.jpg|thumb|left|Official [[White House]] portrait of Grover Cleveland, painted in 1891 by [[Eastman Johnson|Jonathan Eastman Johnson]]]]
As the [[United States presidential election, 1896|1896 election]] approached, eastern pro-gold-standard Democrats wished Cleveland to run for a third term, but he declined.<ref name=graff128>Graff, 128<U+2013>129</ref>  Instead, the Democratic party turned to a silverite, [[William Jennings Bryan]], for its nominee.<ref>Nevins, 684<U+2013>693</ref>  Disappointed with the direction of their party, [[National Democratic Party (United States)|Gold Democrats]] even invited Cleveland to run as a third-party candidate, but he declined this offer, as well.<ref name=graff128/>  However, in the election  of 1896, Cleveland bolted party ranks to support [[John M. Palmer]], nominee of the Gold Democrats.<ref>William DeGregorio, ''The Complete Book of U.S. Presidents'', Gramercy 1997</ref> [[William McKinley]], the Republican nominee, triumphed easily over Bryan.<ref>{{Leip PV source 2|year=1896| as of=February 23, 2008}}</ref>

After leaving the White House, Cleveland lived in retirement at his estate, [[Westland Mansion]], in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].<ref name=graff131>Graff, 131<U+2013>133; Nevins, 730<U+2013>735</ref>  For a time he was a trustee of [[Princeton University]], and was one of the majority of trustees who preferred [[Andrew Fleming West]]'s plans for the Graduate School and undergraduate living over those of [[Woodrow Wilson]], then president of the University.<ref>Graff, p. 131; Alexander Leitch, ''A Princeton Companion'', Princeton Univ Press, 1978, " [http://etcweb.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/mfs/05/Companion/cleveland_grover.html?19#mfs Grover Cleveland]"</ref> Conservative Democrats hoped to nominate him for another presidential term in [[United States presidential election, 1904|1904]], but his age and health forced them to turn to other candidates.<ref>Graff, 134</ref>  Cleveland still made his views known in political matters. In a 1905 article in ''The Ladies Home Journal,'' Cleveland weighed in on the [[women's suffrage]] movement, writing that "sensible and responsible women do not want to vote. The relative positions to be assumed by men and women in the working out of our civilization were assigned long ago by a higher intelligence."<ref>''Ladies Home Journal'' 22, (October 1905), 7<U+2013>8</ref>

Cleveland's health had been declining for several years, and in the autumn of 1907 he fell seriously ill.<ref name=graff135>Graff, 135<U+2013>136; Nevins, 762<U+2013>764</ref>  In 1908, he suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and died.<ref name=graff135/>  His last words were "I have tried so hard to do right."<ref>Jeffers, 340; Graff, 135. Nevins makes no mention of these last words.</ref>  He is buried in the [[Princeton Cemetery]] of the [[Nassau Presbyterian Church]].

==Honors and memorials==
[[Image:1000-2f.jpg|left|frame|Cleveland on the $1000 bill]]

In his first term in office, Cleveland sought a summer house to escape the heat and smells of Washington, D.C., but needed to remain near the capital.  Acting in secret, he located a house, Oak View (or Oak Hill), in a rural upland part of the District of Columbia, and bought it in 1886.  Although he sold Oak View upon leaving the White House (the first time), the area became known as [[Cleveland Park, Washington, D.C.|Cleveland Park]], which name it still bears.  The Clevelands are depicted in local murals and the like.<ref>See, ''e.g.'', Cleveland Park Historical Society, "[http://www.clevelandparkdc.org/cphistory.htm A Brief History of Cleveland Park]"; accessed 2009.04.08.</ref>

Cleveland's portrait was on the U.S. [[Large denominations of United States currency|$1000 bill]] from 1928 to 1946. He also appeared on a $1000 bill of 1907 and the first few issues of the $20 [[Federal Reserve Note]]s from 1914.

Since he was both the 22nd and 24th President, he will be featured on two separate dollar coins to be released in 2012 as part of the [[Presidential $1 Coin Program|Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005]].

In 2006, Free New York, a nonprofit and nonpartisan research group, began raising funds to purchase the former Fairfield Library in [[Buffalo, New York]] and transform it into the Grover Cleveland Presidential Library & Museum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://groverclevelandlibrary.org |title=Grover Cleveland Library |accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref>
