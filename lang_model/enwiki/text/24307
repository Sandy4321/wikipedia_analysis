At the age of 15, Drake was a high school cutup who had a friend with a father who was an agent. He got him a role on the Canadian TV show ''[[Degrassi: The Next Generation]]'' as [[List of Degrassi: The Next Generation characters|Jimmy Brooks]].<ref name="Post">{{cite news |title=Preview: Drake rises from the rap pack with a moody, sensual style |author=post-gazette.com |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/ae/music/preview-drake-rises-from-the-rap-pack-with-a-moody-sensual-style-637301/?print=1 |newspaper= |date=24 May 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> In the show, Brooks is a basketball star who became physically disabled after he was shot by a classmate. Drake describes how his early acting career affected his family, "My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was off of Canadian TV, which isn<U+2019>t that much money when you break it down. A season of Canadian television is under a teacher<U+2019>s salary, I<U+2019>ll tell you that much. It<U+2019>s definitely not something to go fucking get."<ref name="Complex" /> He would continue his acting career on ''Degrassi: The Next Generation'' until 2009, when his character graduated from Degrassi. Overall, he appeared in a total of 138 episodes. Drake is mentioned in the 2010 television movie ''[[Degrassi Takes Manhattan]]'', making him one of two Degrassi actors (along with [[Shenae Grimes]]) who exist within the series' fictional universe independently of their characters. Besides Degrassi, between 2001-2009 Drake appeared on other various Television shows in smaller roles such as, [[Blue Murder (Canadian TV series)|Blue Murder]] as Joey Tamarin, [[Soul Food (TV series)|Soul Food]] as Fredrick, [[The Border (TV series)|The Border]] as PFC Gordon Harvey, and [[Beyond the Break]] as himself.

Looking back on his early life, Drake had to essentially live two different lives because of his parents' divorce; he lived in a very upper-class part of Toronto, and, when in Memphis, was told he was <U+201C>the furthest thing from hood.<U+201D> He witnessed many life-changing experiences because of this, one being his father's arrest, which he describes by saying <U+201C>The fact that I didn<U+2019>t have a father, because he was in jail two separate times. He did a two-year bid and a three-year bid, I was there when he got taken down. We had just gotten back from Memphis.<U+201D> However, Drake comments on his childhood experiences by saying <U+201C>I<U+2019>ve seen things that didn<U+2019>t make me happy. They were character building. That<U+2019>s why I think people in the hood can still connect with what I<U+2019>m saying even though I<U+2019>m not saying <U+2018>yeah I got crack in my pocket<U+2019> <U+2019>cause that wasn<U+2019>t my struggle necessarily, [but] I speak from a place that<U+2019>s just human emotion.<U+201D> Drake stated that his parents' divorce greatly affected him as a person, saying, <U+201C>I had to become a man very quickly and be the backbone for a woman who I love with all my heart, my mother." At the age of 24, Drake commented on his early life by saying "I<U+2019>ve seen a lot, man. I<U+2019>ve seen a lot of life, put it that way. I<U+2019>ve been with the most blessed kids in the world. I<U+2019>ve been with people whose life is right at the bottom of the barrel. I was on a TV show, I went to [[art school]], I went to hood schools. I<U+2019>ve lived. I<U+2019>ve lived a full 24 years man."<ref name="Complex" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://neonlimelight.com/2009/07/15/drake-reveals-childhood-struggles-i-had-to-become-a-man-very-quickly/|title=Drake Reveals Childhood Struggles: <U+2018>I Had To Become A Man Very Quickly<U+2019>|publisher=Neon Limelight|date=July 15, 2009|accessdate=December 7, 2010}}</ref>

===2006<U+2013>09: Mixtapes and ''So Far Gone''===
In 2006, Drake [[self-released]] his first mixtape ''[[Room for Improvement]]''. The [[mixtape]] features artists [[Trey Songz]] and [[Lupe Fiasco]]. He described it as "pretty straightforward, radio friendly, not much content to it." In a TeenNick interview from that time, he cited his influences as rappers [[Jay-Z]], [[Clipse]], [[Talib Kweli]], [[Mos Def]] and singers [[Anthony Hamilton (musician)|Anthony Hamilton]] and [[Maxwell (musician)|Maxwell]].<ref name="Post" /> In 2007, he released another mixtape, ''[[Comeback Season (mixtape)|Comeback Season]]'', spawning a single and a music video for "Replacement Girl" featuring [[Trey Songz]]. Also in 2007, Drake became the first unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video featured on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] when his first single, "Replacement Girl" was featured as the "New Joint of the Day" on April 30, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.str8hiphop.com/node/2462|title=Str8hiphop.com Alumni Artist Drake Has Made It to BET<U+2019>s 106 & Park|date=May 7, 2007|work=Str8 Hip Hop|accessdate=July 14, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref> It also contained a freestyle over a song with [[Lil Wayne]], a remix of "Man of the Year" originally by [[Brisco (rapper)|Brisco]] and [[Flo Rida]]. In 2008, Lil Wayne was given some of Drake's music from [[Rap-A-Lot]] founder, [[J. Prince]]'s son, Jas Prince, and he immediately called Drake to invite him to fly to [[Houston]] and tour with him. Drake and Wayne recorded a couple of songs during this time, including "Ransom", the original version of "I Want This Forever", and the remix to Drake's song, "Brand New". Though now part of Lil Wayne's crew, Young Money, Drake was not signed. On February 13, 2009, Drake released his third official mixtape, ''[[So Far Gone (mixtape)|So Far Gone]]'', for free download on his blog site which included Drake's mentor Lil Wayne, [[Bun B]], [[Omarion]], [[Lloyd (singer)|Lloyd]] and his friend, Trey Songz. It received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2 hours of release. It was extremely successful in the underground and eventually made its way to radio. Due to the success of the mixtape's two singles, "[[Best I Ever Had (Drake song)|Best I Ever Had]]" and "[[Successful (song)|Successful]]", it was released as an [[So Far Gone (EP)|EP]] featuring only five songs from the mix tape and one new song. MTV named it "The Hottest Mixtape of 2009 (So Far)".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1616357/20090715/drake.jhtml|title=MTV.com Drake's So Far Gone Is The Hottest Mixtape Of 2009 (So Far)}}</ref> Since ''So Far Gone'', Drake worked with [[Rihanna]], [[DJ Khaled]], [[Young Money]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Kanye West]], [[Eminem]], [[Young Jeezy]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Timbaland]], [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]], [[Trey Songz]], and [[Jamie Foxx]]. Drake has also written for [[Alicia Keys]], and [[Dr. Dre]]. ''So Far Gone'' is credited as being his commercial and critical breakthrough as it was much more critically acclaimed and commercially successful than his previous two releases.

He achieved success before signing to a major record label, according to his management [[Hip Hop Since 1978]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UPDATE: Drake Not Signed To Universal Motown, Close To Inking Deal|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=45502|work=XXL|date=May 5, 2009}}</ref> In June 2009, it was revealed that an unauthorized album entitled ''The Girls Love Drake'' and credited to Drake was up for sale on iTunes.

When you ask me, 'What do I think of Kanye West,' I'mma always have something positive to say."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1653947/drake-with-being-dropped-from-kanye-wests-all-lights.jhtml|title=Drake 'OK' With Being Dropped From Kanye West's 'All Of The Lights'|work=[[MTV]]|date=December 9, 2010}}</ref> Drake's musical abilities have often been compared to West. He commented on this by saying, "It's an honor, when I was a kid trying to figure out what I liked, it was 'Ye who I related to the most. He was an artist, in every sense, from his cover art to his music. Now, I would say, he is really great, competitor...and friend, at the same time. My goal is to surpass everything he<U+2019>s accomplished. I don't want to be as good as Kanye, I want to be better."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://youheardthatnew.com/2011/11/drake-i-dont-want-to-be-as-good-as-kanye-i-want-to-be-better/|title=Drake: "I Don<U+2019>t Want To Be As Good As Kanye, I Want To Be Better."|work=You Heard That New|date=November 10, 2012}}</ref> 

In an interview with SoulCulture TV Drake stated that [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Aaliyah]] has had the biggest influence on his career. "Aaliyah has had probably the most impact on my career," he states, "because when I made a choice to start [[singing]] it was because of something that my father had told me which was, 'There's no [[rapper]] out there that sings and raps and does both things well... and in order to be successful you're gonna need something other than just what everyone else is doing. I was rapping already at the time so I had an identity in rap, but when I started singing I needed something to reference. I needed someone to be like, 'I wanna be like that'. I didn't want it ever to be a male because then I would sound like that person, so I just found comfort in all of Aaliyah's music and her [[melody]] choices and the things that she talks about <U+2013> and how she always conveyed these amazing emotions but never got too sappy, she always kept it G. That had the biggest influence on my music because <U+2013> as much as my music may be geared towards women <U+2013> I try not to make it so that only women can sing it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soulculture.co.uk/videos/drake-reflects-aaliyah-had-the-biggest-influence-on-my-music-soulculture-tv/#axzz22Kc3Ih83|title=Drake reflects: "Aaliyah had the biggest influence on my music"|work=Soulculture.co.uk|date=January 16, 2011}}</ref>

===Musical style===
Most of Drake's lyricism are in regard to his riches, fame and past relationships. [[Allmusic]] describes Drake's moods as searching, thoughtful, introspective, brooding, confident, dramatic, earnest, energetic, humorous, intense, laid-back/mellow, literate, melancholy, nostalgic, playful, reflective, smooth, tender, warm and yearning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/drake-mn0001035294|title=Drake - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> Drake's sound is labeled as "soft" for his genuine, merciful lyrics and soulful melody to most hip hop listeners. He denied this by saying "I'm not soft. I'm just not one of those people who's closed off emotionally."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/mar/29/drake-why-hate-me-so-much|title=Drake: 'Why do you hate me so much?'|work=The Guardian|date=March 29, 2011}}</ref> A large portion of Drake's work incorporates elements of both [[rapping]] and [[singing]], which has led to him being unique as a recording artist. Drake has even described himself as "the first person to successfully rap and sing." He went on further about his statement by saying "I'm one of the few artists who gets to be himself every day. It doesn't take me six hours to get ready and I don't have to wake up in the morning and remember to act like this or talk like this. I just have to be me. That's one of the favourite parts of my life - I've done this purely by being myself."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/article/drake-crowns-himself-first-successful-rap-singer|title=Drake Crowns himself as the first successful rap-singer|work=Vibe.com|date=July 27, 2012}}</ref>

Drake has a unique musical style that has set him apart from his (Young Money) counterparts, especially on his latest effort ''[[Take Care (album)|Take Care]]''. [[Lil Wayne]] even commented on the project prior to its release saying "I can tell, you know, I don't know nothing else out there that can touch it, including my stuff. That kid is on another planet."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1672760/lil-wayne-drake-take-care-album.jhtml|title=Lil Wayne Says Nothing Can 'Touch' Drake's Take Care|work=[[MTV]]|date=Oct 18, 2011|accessdate=August 2, 2012}}</ref> Recently, Drake has been making a notable shift away from [[Young Money]]/[[Cash Money Millionaires|Cash Money]] collaborations and towards a new project, OVOXO. The OVO [[owl]] symbolizes OVOXO, which is a separate entity from [[Young Money]]/[[Cash Money Millionaires|Cash Money]] and represents a collaboration group between Drake and R&B singer [[The Weeknd]]. Its eyes and beak form the acronym for October's Very Own. Drake has been moving in this new direction after the release of ''Take Care'', which featured writing collaborations with The Weeknd on 5 tracks ranging from "[[Crew Love]]" to "Shot for Me" and 2 production collaborations on "Crew Love" and "The Ride", more than any Young Money/Cash Money collaborate.<ref name="Track listing">{{cite web|url=http://rapfix.mtv.com/2011/10/31/tracklist-features-revealed--take-care-album/|title=Tracklist And Features Revealed For 's 'Take Care'|publisher=MTV RapFix|date=October 31, 2011|accessdate=October 31, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Track listing2">{{cite web|url=http://www.soulculture.co.uk/blogs/music-blog/drake-take-care-tracklist-production-credits-features/|title=Drake <U+2013> Take Care | Tracklist + Production Credits + Features|publisher=SoulCulture.com|date=November 6, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-06}}</ref><ref name="Take Care iTunes">{{cite web|url=http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/take-care-deluxe-version/id479760323|title=iTunes - Music - Take Care (Deluxe Version) by Drake|publisher=iTunes Store|date=November 15, 2011|accessdate=November 15, 2011}}</ref>

The first artist to publicly diss Drake on a song was [[Pusha T]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/singles/id.16866/title.pusha-t-dont-fuck-with-me-dreams-money-can-buy|title=Don't Fuck With Me (Dreams Money Can Buy) |work=HipHopDX|accessdate=September 26, 2011}}</ref> He remixed Drake's "Dream Money Can Buy" and released a single called "Exodus 23:1" on [[Kanye West]]'s [[GOOD Music]] label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/trending/2012/05/24/pusha_t_s_exodus_23_1_starts_beef_with_lil_wayne_drake.html|title=Common Pusha T's "Exodus 23:1" Starts Beef With Lil Wayne, Drake |work=slate.com|accessdate=August 1, 2012}}</ref> Lil Wayne first responded to the Pusha T in a diss track titled "Ghoulish" where he raps "Fuck Pusha T and anybody that love him/ His head up his ass/ I'ma have to head-butt him, gut him" and tweeting to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2012/05/29/lil-wayne-responds-to-pusha-t-with-diss-track-goulish/|title=Lil Wayne Responds to Pusha T with Diss Track, "Goulish"|work=thefader.com|accessdate=August 1, 2012}}</ref> Drake then responded to the attack by Pusha T live at his [[Club Paradise Tour|Club Paradise]] show in [[Washington, D.C.]] by saying "If you was doing 16s when I was 16 and your shit still flopped and you switched teams, don't talk to me my nigga."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/05/drake-responds-to-pusha-t-at-live-show-in-washington-dc|title=Drake Responds To Pusha T At Live Show In Washington D.C.|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=August 1, 2012}}</ref> Pusha T has stated that he has failed to respond to Lil Wayne's diss because he felt it was not good enough to respond to.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2012/06/21/pusha-t-sounds-off-on-lil-wayne-beef-chris-brown-vs-drake/|title=PUSHA T SOUNDS OFF ON LIL WAYNE BEEF, CHRIS BROWN VS. DRAKE |work=Rap-Up.com|accessdate=August 1, 2012}}</ref> The beef between Drake and Pusha T has not been squashed.

===Common===
During the ''Take Care'' era, Drake had numerous attacks from other rappers. [[Common (entertainer)|Common]] made a song titled "Sweet" (See ''[[The Dreamer/The Believer]]'') although it was not specifically aimed at Drake.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rapradar.com/2011/12/20/common-responds-to-drake-shade-45/|title=Common Responds To Drake (Shade 45)|work=Rap Radar|accessdate=December 20, 2012}}</ref>. Drake took offense (as the song had lyrics critical of rappers who sing on their tracks) and released "[[Stay Schemin']]", a song with [[Rick Ross]] and [[French Montana]], with subliminal attacks such as "Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon/ Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record", which refers to Drake essentially saying that Common only dissed him to try and sell his album, which was to be released a month after the track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/is-drake-dissing-common-on-rick-ross-stay-schemin-/60283/|title=Is Drake Dissing Common On Rick Ross' "Stay Schemin'"? |work=Prefixmag.com|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}</ref> Common also made a controversial remix to [[Rick Ross (rapper)|Rick Ross]]'s song "Stay Schemin'" featuring [[French Montana]] and Drake from the mixtape ''[[Rich Forever]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rapradar.com/2012/01/09/new-music-common-stay-schemin-drake-diss/|title=New Music: Common "Stay Schemin" (Drake Diss)|work=Rap Radar|accessdate=January 9, 2012}}</ref> On February 13, 2012, Common commented on the feud by saying "It's over. But it was all in the art of hip hop. He said some things to me so I had to say some things back...I wouldn't say [he started it] but I know I heard something that I felt was directed to me so I addressed it. That's all. But you know, thank God we were able to move forward from it and all is good."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.18651/title.common-confirms-drake-beef-is-over-sends-prayers-to-whitney-houstons-family|title=Common Confirms Drake Beef Is "Over," Sends Prayers To Whitney Houston's Family |work=HipHopDx|accessdate=August 1, 2012}}</ref>

===Chris Brown===
Drake and [[Chris Brown (American entertainer)|Chris Brown]] were allegedly involved in a physical altercation on June 14, 2012, when Drake and his entourage allegedly threw glass bottles towards Chris Brown at a nightclub called WIP in the [[SoHo]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], [[New York]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2012/06/27/chris-brown-drake-fight-wip-nightclut-liquor-license/|title=Chris Brown / Drake Fight W.i.P.

In an interview in April 2013, Drake said about Brown: "Stop preying on his insecurities. His insecurities are the fact that I make better music than him, that I<U+2019>m more poppin<U+2019> than him, and that at one point in life, the woman that he loves fell into my lap. I did what a real ni**a would do and treated her with respect, so she not up there talking down on me....It shouldn<U+2019>t be about wanting to see me and him tear each other down; we have an issue and it<U+2019>s either gonna drag out or maybe in 10 years we<U+2019>ll laugh about it over drinks.
