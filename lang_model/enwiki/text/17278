'''Gottfried von Haberler''' ([[1900]] - [[May 6]], [[1995]]) was an economist. He worked in particular on [[international trade]].

Haberler was born in Austria in 1900, and was educated in the [[Austrian School]] of economics.  In 1936 he moved to the United States, joining the economics department at [[Harvard]]. Here he worked alongside [[Joseph Schumpeter]].  

Haberler's two major works were ''Theory of International Trade'' (1936) and ''Prosperity and Depression'' (1937).

In 1957 [[GATT]] commissioned a report on the terms of trade for primary commodities, and Haberler was appointed Chairman.  The report found that there was a decline in the terms of trade for primary producers, since 1955 commodity prices were said to have fallen by 5%, whilst industrial prices rose by 6%.  Haberler's report seems to prefigure the report written by [[Prebisch]] for [[UNCTAD]] in 1964, but when Prebisch's report came out Haberler denounced it.  His particular disagreement was with the idea that there was a systematic long-term (secular) decline in the terms of trade.

In 1971, Haberler left Harvard to become a resident scholar at the [[American Enterprise Institute]].
