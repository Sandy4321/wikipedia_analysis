===Development===
Prior to appearing in ''Casualty'', Sarker had played a guest role in spin-off show ''Holby City''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Sarker describes Zoe as: "strong, cheeky and rebellious", as well as "very selfish, very righteous, very rude and self-centred".{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Sarker commented that although Zoe initially began fostering Sharice out of guilt, as the story progressed, she adapted to the role more easily than she had expected, and: "underneath all the Zoe layers, I think there's quite a decent human being. She's just layered by a lot of selfishness, a lot of righteousness, a lot of pigheadedness, and those traits don't lend them to being a mother very easily. I think that once she's peeled off a few of those layers, she's quite liking being a mum.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Having given up Sharice, Zoe then embarks on a relationship with department head [[Nick Jordan (character)|Nick Jordan]]. Sarker explained that Zoe and Nick have  a very interesting dynamic" and that: "You can see that they're very similar people which would make them allies or enemies. [...] Zoe's the first female to meet Jordan's professional standards. She's no pussycat and Jordan knows that. He's got a certain amount of respect for her, as she has for him.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Characterising the relationship, Sarker explained: "They've both been single for a very long time through their own choices and neither of them feel any pressure or expectations, which is a good combination for something to happen. I think this is the grown-up version of a flirtation. It's a bit more factual with these two; there isn't much softness or gooeyness to them. They are more like steel on steel!"{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} 

In 2012, after the characters of Sam and Dylan got married, ''Casualty'' producer [[Nikki Wilson]] teased Zoe's relationship to ''[[Inside Soap]]'' with Dylan saying, "The relationship between Dylan and Zoe is very interesting, because when we first mentioned the obvious chemistry between the pair to the actors who play them [William Beck and Sunetra Sarker], they genuinely had no idea! So in one way it's great that they're not playing it in that way. But we really enjoy their banter, and there's definetly a lot more stuff to happen between them.

Lloyd is from a very strong, cultural black background and is very rooted in his origins, whereas Scarlett was brought up in a white family. So we're really interested in exploring the two differences in indentity between the two."<ref name="2012 NH"/>
