'''No. 82 Squadron RAAF''' was a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] fighter squadron that operated during World War&nbsp;II and its immediate aftermath. It was formed in June 1943, flying [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk]]s and, initially, [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]]s from bases in Queensland and New Guinea. The squadron became operational in September 1944, and undertook ground attack missions against Japanese targets in the [[Pacific theatre of World War II|Pacific theatre]]. Following the end of hostilities, No.&nbsp;82 Squadron was re-equipped with [[North American P-51 Mustang]]s and deployed to Japan, where it formed part of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]]. It remained there until October 1948, when it was disbanded.

==History==
===World War II===
During 1943, the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) received 399 [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighter aircraft. Their arrival allowed the service to expand its combat force by forming five new Kittyhawk-equipped squadrons to join the three squadrons that had operated the type in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific area]] since 1942.{{sfn|Wilson|1988|p=161}} No.&nbsp;82 Squadron was formed at [[Bankstown, New South Wales]], on 18&nbsp;June 1943.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|p=78}} It was the third of the new Kittyhawk squadrons to be established, following [[No. 84 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;84 Squadron]] in February and [[No. 86 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;86 Squadron]] in March; [[No. 78 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;78 Squadron]] was formed in July and [[No. 80 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;80 Squadron]] in September.{{sfn|Wilson|1988|p=161}} Commanded by [[Squadron Leader]] Stanley Galton, No.&nbsp;82 Squadron's original complement was 279, including fifteen officers. It was to have been equipped wholly with P-40M Kittyhawks but initially included a [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] of [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]]s. No.&nbsp;82 Squadron conducted training at Bankstown until April 1944, when personnel briefly moved to [[Hughes Airfield]] in the [[Northern Territory]], before being redeployed to [[Townsville, Queensland]], for further training.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|p=78}}

The squadron transferred to [[Port Moresby]], New Guinea, at the end of August 1944 and then on to [[Noemfoor|Noemfoor Island]] in mid-September, where it joined [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&nbsp;76]] and [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|77 Squadrons]] as part of [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;81 Wing]] under No.&nbsp;10 Operational Group (later the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]]).<ref name="RAAF1994">{{cite journal|title=81WG: then and now|work=RAAF News|date=July 1994|page=p. 15}}</ref>{{sfn|Odgers|1968|pp=298<U+2013>299}} Three of No.&nbsp;82 Squadron's Kittyhawks crashed due to engine trouble while staging through [[Lae Nadzab Airport|Nadzab]] and [[adji, Papua New Guinea|Tadji]].{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=213}} Operating from Kamiri strip, the squadron flew its first combat mission on 30&nbsp;September, bombing Samate airstrip with aircraft from No.&nbsp;77 Squadron.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|p=79}} On 18&nbsp;October, one aircraft was lost to ground fire during an attack on [[Kai Islands|Kai Island]], while another was reported missing.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=214}} No.&nbsp;82 Squadron found it difficult to remain operational as most of its ground crew remained in Townsville until moving forward the following month; in the meantime, the pilots took responsibility for arming and refuelling their aircraft.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=94}}{{sfn|Odgers|1968|p=304}} On 23&nbsp;November, they dive bombed Japanese airfields on [[Halmahera]] with aircraft of No.&nbsp;76 Squadron.{{sfn|Odgers|1968|p=312}}

No.&nbsp;82 Squadron continued to conduct ground attack missions in New Guinea until March 1945, when it relocated to [[Morotai Island]] in the [[Netherlands East Indies]] (NEI). From Morotai, the squadron conducted ground attack missions in the NEI and escorted Allied convoys carrying troops bound for the [[Borneo campaign (1945)|liberation of Borneo]].{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|pp=80<U+2013>81}} The relegation of First Tactical Air Force to areas of operation bypassed by the main Allied thrust towards the Philippines and Japan led to poor morale, culminating in the so-called "[[Morotai Mutiny]]" of April 1945.{{sfn|Odgers|1968|pp=386<U+2013>390}}{{sfn|Odgers|1968|pp=443<U+2013>450}} Squadron Leader Bert Grace, commanding officer of No.&nbsp;82 Squadron, was among eight senior pilots who tended their resignations in protest at what they saw as the waste of resources on targets of dubious military value. The officers were persuaded to continue on operations, and Grace oversaw the squadron's move to [[Labuan|Labuan island]] in June as part of Operation Oboe Six, the [[Battle of North Borneo|invasion of North Borneo]].{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|pp=80<U+2013>81}}{{sfn|Johnston|2011|pp=408<U+2013>409}} The Kittyhawks flew in support of [[Australian Army]] units until the end of the war. On one such mission on 8&nbsp;August 1945, No.&nbsp;82 Squadron made a {{convert|900|mi|km|adj=on}} round trip to attack targets around [[Kuching]] in [[Sarawak]]. During the first strike two Japanese aircraft were destroyed as they were taking off from the airstrip, while a transport was also destroyed and two more were damaged. The fighters then attacked several barges near Kuching Town and on the [[Sarawak River]].{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|pp=80<U+2013>81}} Fourteen members of the squadron were killed on operations during the war.{{sfn|Johnston|2011|p=448}}

Shortly after the end of the war, No.&nbsp;82 Squadron was selected to join the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF) in Japan.{{sfn|Stephens|1995|pp=211<U+2013>214}} It re-equipped with [[North American P-51 Mustang|North American P-51D Mustang]] fighters between 12&nbsp;September and 11&nbsp;January 1946, losing two aircraft to accidents in the process.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|p=81}} The squadron deployed to [[H<U+014D>fu, Yamaguchi|Bofu]], a former [[kamikaze]] base, during 13<U+2013>18&nbsp;March 1946, once again as part of No.&nbsp;81 Wing with Nos.&nbsp;76 and 77 Squadrons; Nos.&nbsp;381 and 481 Squadrons provided logistics and maintenance support, respectively. No.&nbsp;82 Squadron lost three of its twenty-eight Mustangs, along with an escorting [[de&nbsp;Havilland Mosquito]], in bad weather en route to Bofu, killing all crew members.{{sfn|Stephens|1995|pp=211<U+2013>214}} From April 1946, the squadron conducted surveillance patrols over Japan as well as participating in routine exercises and flypasts.{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|p=81}} The Australians found that, far from offering resistance, the Japanese went out of their way to be accommodating. No.&nbsp;82 Squadron's  commanding officer, Squadron Leader Graham Falconer, remarked following a dinner with Bofu's mayor, "I felt that we were being treated more as visitors than as an occupying force!"{{sfn|Eather|1996|pp=6<U+2013>7}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/people_1077839.asp|title=Squadron Leader Graham Falconer|publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate=2 January 2015}}</ref>

No.&nbsp;81 Wing transferred to [[Iwakuni]] in April 1948, the same month that the Federal government determined to reduce Australia's contribution to BCOF.{{sfn|Stephens|2006|pp=213<U+2013>216}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=176 |title=Occupation air group arrived in Japan|publisher=Air Power Development Centre|accessdate= 22 November 2014}}</ref> As part of this reduction, Nos.&nbsp;76 and 82 Squadrons were slated for disbandment, leaving No.&nbsp;77 Squadron as the sole RAAF fighter unit in the country.{{sfn|Eather|1996|p=15}} No.&nbsp;82 Squadron conducted further training and exercises until September, and was disbanded at Iwakuni on 29&nbsp;October 1948.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=215}}{{sfn|RAAF Historical Section|1995|p=82}}
