'''Tropical Storm Barry''' was a strong [[Tropical cyclone|tropical storm]] that made landfall on the [[Florida]] [[Florida Panhandle|Panhandle]] during August 2001. The third tropical cyclone and second named storm of the [[2001 Atlantic hurricane season]], Barry developed from a [[tropical wave]] that moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on July 24 and tracked westward. The wave entered the [[Caribbean]] on July 29 and sparked  [[convection]], which organized into Tropical Storm Barry on August 3. After fluctuations in intensity and track, the system attained peak winds of {{convert|70|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and headed northward before moving ashore on the Gulf Coast.

Unlike the devastating [[Tropical Storm Allison]] earlier in the season, Barry's effects were moderate. Nine deaths occurred, six in [[Cuba]] and three in [[Florida]]. As a tropical cyclone, rainfall peaked at {{convert|8.9|in|mm|abbr=on}} at [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], and winds gusts topped out at {{convert|79|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The wave that would become Barry dropped large amounts of rain across southern Florida, which led to significant flooding and structural damage. Moderate flooding occurred throughout the Panhandle, where damage was also reported as a result of high wind gusts. As the storm's remnants tracked inland, parts of the [[Mississippi Valley]] received light precipitation. Barry is estimated to have caused $30&nbsp;million (2001&nbsp;USD, $36.5&nbsp;million 2008&nbsp;USD) in damage.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Barry 2001 track.png}}
On July 24, 2001, a [[tropical wave]] emerged off the west coast of [[Africa]], and tracked westward across the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Little development occurred until July 28, when convective activity began to increase. The wave moved into the eastern [[Caribbean]] on July 29, and while tracking west-northwest [[convection]] continued to increase over the next few days. The disturbance emerged into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on August 1, with associated rainfall over southern [[Florida]] and the western tip of [[Cuba]]. A broad low pressure system with a [[Barometric pressure|minimum central pressure]] of 1014&nbsp;mb developed along the wave near the [[Dry Tortugas]], at the end of the Florida Keys, that same day, and began to intensify as it moved northwestward. At around 1800&nbsp;UTC on August 2, an [[Air Force Reserve]] [[Hurricane Hunter]] aircraft investigated the system and discovered that the low had organized into Tropical Storm ''Barry''. The low developed into a tropical depression six hours earlier, as revealed by post-season analysis.<Ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Tropical Storm Barry|date=April 22, 2001|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-07-17|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2001barry.html}}</ref> There is uncertainty as to whether the storm actually held tropical characteristics at the time of designation because an upper-level low was situated over the surface center.<Ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Tropical Storm Barry|year=2001|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-07-17|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2001barry.html}}</ref> 

Upon becoming a [[tropical cyclone]], convection wrapped around roughly half of the center. Outflow in the eastern semi-circle was good, although due to upper-level [[wind shear]], it was restricted to southeast of the circulation.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stewart|title=Tropical Storm Barry Discussion Number 2|date=August 2, 2001|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-07-17|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2001/dis/al032001.discus.002.html}}</ref> The cyclone became embedded within a [[Trough (meteorology)|mid- to-upper-level trough]] between the ridge over the central U.S. and the ridge over the northwestern Caribbean. A strong, upper-level cyclonic [[Wind shear#Horizontal component|shear axis]] extended from just south of [[Cape Hatteras]] to near [[Brownsville, Texas]], which prevented Barry from accelerating in forward speed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Beven|title=Tropical Storm Barry Discussion Number 3|date=August 2, 2001|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-07-17|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2001/dis/al032001.discus.003.html}}</ref> The ridge over the [[United States]] weakened, thus collapsing the steering pattern; this resulted in a west-southwestward drifting motion of the tropical storm by around August 3.<ref name="tcr"/> Early on August 3, strong westerly winds prevailed, and separated the center of circulation from what limited convection remained.<ref>{{cite web|author=Avila|title=Tropical Storm Barry Discussion Number 4|August 3, 2004|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-07-17|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2001/dis/al032001.discus.004.html}}</ref> The storm quickly regained some convection, although [[maximum sustained wind]]s remained weak, at about 40&nbsp;mph (60&nbsp;km/h).<ref>{{cite web|author=Stewart|title=Tropical Storm Barry Discussion Number 5|date=August 3, 2004|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-07-17|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2001/dis/al032001.discus.005.html}}</ref> Despite a slight drop in barometric pressure, post-season analysis revealed Barry weakened into a tropical depression early on August 4 due to the persistent wind shear and falling external pressure.<ref name="tcr"/>

==Preparations==
[[Image:Kevx radar 080801 0354.gif|right|thumb|Radar image of the storm making landfall on the Florida Panhandle]]
In advance of the storm, the National Hurricane Center issued tropical storm watches and warnings for much of the U.S. Gulf Coast. They were upgraded to a hurricane warning when the storm was predicted to reach hurricane intensity. Because that strengthening failed to occur, the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning shortly before landfall. Westward, the warnings for [[Louisiana]] and [[Mississippi]] were discontinued. After Tropical Storm Barry made landfall, all tropical storm warnings for the Florida Panhandle were discontinued.<ref name="tcr"/> Flood warnings were issued for parts of [[Leon County, Florida|Leon]] and [[Wakulla County, Florida|Wakulla]] counties, while a flash flood watch was in effect for parts of southern [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]].<ref name="hpc"/> A tornado watch was issued for the eastern Florida Panhandle, southern Georgia, as well as portions of central and eastern Alabama.<ref>{{cite web|author=Roth|title=HPC Storm Summary #19 for T.D.

==Impact==

=== Cuba and Florida ===
The wave that would eventually become Barry dropped widespread rainfall in western Cuba, though no damages were reported. Offshore, high seas sank a Cuban refugee boat, drowning six of its 28&nbsp;passengers.<ref name="tcr"/> 

Three people in Florida were killed by the storm, and total damage is estimated at around $30&nbsp;million (2001&nbsp;USD, $36.5&nbsp;million 2008&nbsp;USD).<ref name="ncdcreport1"/> In southern Florida, the precursor to Barry produced 3&nbsp;in (75&nbsp;mm) to {{convert|8|in|mm|abbr=on}}, with rainfall peaking at  {{convert|13|in|mm|abbr=on}}. The rain helped relieve persistent [[drought]] conditions,<ref name="tcr"/> though it caused significant flooding in [[Martin County, Florida|Martin County]] on August 2, where a total of 300&nbsp;homes received water damage.

Due to the initial slow movement of the storm, outer rain bands began affecting the Florida Panhandle on August 4, with the heaviest rainfall observed on August 5 &ndash; August 6. The storm dropped 5&nbsp;in (125&nbsp;mm) to 9&nbsp;in (225&nbsp;mm); the highest official report was {{convert|8.9|in|mm|abbr=on}} at Tallahassee, though unofficial reports ranged as high as 11&nbsp;in (175&nbsp;mm).<ref name="tcr"/> The rainfall inundated several structures in [[Bay County, Florida|Bay County]] due to roof damage. Flooding occurred in Leon County and parts of [[Apalachicola National Forest]], where torrential rains flowed into the [[Cascade Lakes]], Lake Bradford and Munson Slough; the Munson Slough rose to its highest level since 1994.
