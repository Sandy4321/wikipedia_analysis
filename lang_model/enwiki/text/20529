'''Charles Sydney Goldman''' ([[1868]] &ndash; [[7 April]] [[1958]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] businessman, author, and journalist who served as a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) from 1910 until 1918.

Born in [[Cape Colony]], Goldman was a [[uitlander]] who spent much of his life in the [[Transvaal]]. As a young man he built up a fortune in mining, using some of the profits to purchase an extensive estate known as Schoongezicht in the Middelburg District. During the [[Second Boer War]], Goldman was a [[war correspondent]] for ''[[Evening Standard|The Standard]]''. Initially attached to Sir [[Redvers Buller]]'s relief force, he traveled with them as far as [[Siege of Ladysmith|Ladysmith]] after which he transferred to the cavalry advancing north in order to report on their endeavors. These experiences served as the foundation for Goldman's subsequent book ''With General French and the Cavalry in South Africa''.

After the war, in an effort to gain political influence Goldman purchased the struggling weekly journal the ''[[The Outlook (London)|Outlook]]''.<ref>Stephen Koss, ''The Rise and Fall of the Political Press in Britain'', vol. 1:''The Nineteenth Century'' (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1981), p. 434</ref> Seeking to develop it into a prominent platform for the cause of [[Imperial Preference|tariff reformers]], he hired the journalist [[James Louis Garvin|J. L. Garvin]] as its editor. Garvin quickly transformed the journal into a publication of note, yet in spite of an increase in both prominence and circulation the paper failed to turn a profit. After a series of disagreements between the two men over business matters, Goldman sold the paper to [[Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh|Lord Iveagh]] in October 1906.<ref>Alfred M. Gollin, ''The Observer and J. L. Garvin, 1908-1914: A Study in a Great Editorship'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1960), p. 14-15</ref>

Still desiring a political role, Goldman involved himself in politics directly by entering Parliament, winning a seat in the [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|1910 general election]] as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Unionist]] and serving until the borough was abolished in 1918. During the [[World War I|First World War]], Goldman served as a major in the [[Cornwall]] [[Royal Garrison Artillery]]. In 1919 he purchased the Nicola Ranch and Town site in [[British Columbia]] which grew to some 300,000 acres. In England Goldman lived at Trefusis House, [[Falmouth]] until about 1929, after which he moved to the Jacobean mansion at Yaverland Manor.
