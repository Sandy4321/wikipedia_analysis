The '''Bramhope Tunnel''' is a railway [[tunnel]] {{convert|2.138|mi|km}} long, owned by [[Northern Rail]]. It was constructed during 1845&ndash;1849 on the [[Harrogate Line]], carrying rural and commuter passengers between [[Horsforth]] and [[Weeton, North Yorkshire|Weeton]] in [[West Yorkshire]], [[United Kingdom]]. It is notable for its length, for its [[crenellation|crenellated]] north portal, which is Grade II [[listed building|listed]], and for the deaths of 24&nbsp;men during its construction, commemorated in [[Otley]] churchyard with a [[crenellation|castellated]] replica of the north portal.

It was constructed by [[Thomas Grainger]], engineer and James Bray, overseer, who set up two sighting towers and then twenty [[shaft mining|shafts]] along the line of the tunnel.  Men dug horizontally from these shafts until the diggings joined up in 1848. Thousands of [[navvy|navvies]] lived locally in [[bothy|bothies]] with their families, and dug in dangerous and wet conditions to facilitate the grand opening in 1849.

== History ==
[[Image:Bramhope Tunnel south portal.jpg|thumb|left|South portal in 2009]]
The tunnel was first proposed in 1843 with an estimate of <U+00A3>800,000 approved in 1845, though the final cost by 1849 was <U+00A3>2,150,313 and the lives of 24 men. [[Thomas Grainger]]<ref name="listing" /> was the [[engineer]] and James Bray was the contracted overseer in 1845 for the construction of the Horsforth<U+2013>Weeton tunnel under [[Bramhope]] and the ridge between [[Airedale]] and [[Wharfedale]]. Bray was a [[Leeds]] iron and brass [[foundry|founder]], and previously constructed the [[Thackley Tunnel]], Bradford.<ref name="tunnel">{{cite web|url=http://www.bramhope.org/brtunnel.htm|title=Bramhope Tunnel|last=Sunderland|first=Cllr Philip|date=date unknown|publisher=Bramhope Parish Council|accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>

Two sighting towers were built for the engineers to keep the line true, then from 20 October 1845 twenty [[shaft mining|shafts]] were sunk to enable access for tunnelling.  Tunnelling started after the [[cornerstone|foundation stone]] was laid at the bottom of No. 1 airshaft in July 1846. The separate diggings first joined up into one long tunnel on 27 November 1848, and it was completed in summer 1849.<ref name="tunnel" />

The southern entrance or [[portal (architecture)|portal]] is usually described as plain, but is admired by some.  The north portal is castellated, and after it was finished was lived in for a while by railway workers.  The north portal was listed Grade II in 1988.<ref name="listing">{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=436540|title=Bramhope Tunnel: Grade II listing, 1988, with description|publisher=English Heritage National Monuments Record|accessdate=2009-07-19}}</ref> The  finished tunnel is 2&nbsp;miles, 243&nbsp;yd or {{convert|2.138|mi|km}} long; {{convert|25.5|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|25|ft|m}} high. It is a [[double track]] tunnel, with a [[slope|gradient]] of 1 in 94 (0.01%) down from Horsforth to [[Arthington]] and at its deepest point, just to the north of Breary Lane, it is {{convert|290|ft|m}} below the surface. The construction was for the Leeds Northern Railway and the East and West Yorkshire Junction Railway, which together later became the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]]. The grand opening was 9 July 1849, but the first train went through on 31 May in the same year, full of [[Leeds-Northallerton Railway|Leeds and Thirsk]] railway officials, and pulled by Bray's [[locomotive]] ''Stephenson''.<ref name="tunnel" />

=== Working conditions ===
[[Image:Bramhope 052.jpg|thumb|left|[[navvy|Navvies]] lived in [[bothy|bothies]] along the line of the tunnel, near the [[ventilation shaft]]s]]
There were possibly up to 2,300 [[navvy|navvies]] plus their families, with 400 horses brought in for the work. That is said to include 188 [[quarry]]men, 102 [[stonemasonry|stonemasons]], 732 tunnel men, 738 labourers and 18 [[carpentry|carpenters]]. For four years they lived in 200 wooden [[bothy|bothies]] with their families in a field opposite [[Bramhope]] cemetery, alongside offices and workshops. There were 100 more bothies elsewhere along the line of the tunnel. Day<U+2013> and night<U+2013>shifters were said to [[hot racking|take turns]] to use the beds, as was normal for sailors of the time. However, sailors had their own bedding to unroll onto the bare bunk or hammock, whereas many navvies may have had little of their own. This tunnel was built at the height of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Hungry Years]], and many poor [[Irish people|Irish]] refugees were working on the railways.<ref name="tunnel" />

Many of the navvies were farm labourers from the [[Yorkshire Dales]], [[North East England]], [[East Anglia]] and the [[The Fens|Fenlands]] as well as from [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]]. Men were lowered by bucket down the airshafts to dig by [[lantern|candlelight]]. They were paid <U+00A3>1.50 per week to shovel 20 tons (20.32 tonnes) of rock and earth per 12<U+2013>hour shift, seven days a week. Conditions were constantly wet, with foul air and [[gunpowder]] fumes plus the danger of roof<U+2013>collapse.<ref name="tunnel" /> This was because the tunnel cuts through hard sandstone, shale and clay, and there are seven major faults in the rock near the centre point.<ref name="timelines">{{cite web|url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=571|title=Bramhope Tunnel|year=2009|publisher=Engineering Timelines|accessdate=2009-07-19}}</ref> Metal sheets had to be used to divert water inside the tunnel.  A public [[water supply|waterworks]] scheme with [[reservoir]]s and [[aqueduct]] was proposed but not implemented.<ref name="bradfordarchive">{{cite web|url=http://archive.thisisbradford.co.uk/2003/9/4/108484.html|title=Tunnel vision was such a drain on cash and life: from the Telegraph & Argus, first published Thursday 4th Sep 2003.|publisher=Bradford & District archive|accessdate=2010-04-02}}</ref>

=== Human cost ===
[[Image:Bramhope Tunnel memorial.jpg|thumb|right|Bramhope Tunnel memorial, [[Otley]] churchyard]]
The work was dangerous because the rock at the Horsforth end was difficult to [[rock blasting|blast]], and there was frequent flooding and [[subsidence]]. It is suggested that up to 1,563,480,000 gallons (7,107,580,080 litres) of water were pumped out between 1845 and 1849. Five men died in 1846; 12 died in 1847; seven more had died by 1849, making 24 in total. In Otley churchyard is a [[headstone|monument]] in the shape of the north portal, dedicated to the 24 men who lost their lives. Records of death and injury were kept from 1847 to 1849, and [[Leeds General Infirmary|Leeds Infirmary]] had a special [[sprung cart|spring cart]] to ferry the injured to hospital from the site to Leeds.<ref name="tunnel" />

<blockquote>
The sadness of the harsh conditions of those days is captured by the simple epitaph on the gravestone of James Myers who is buried in the Methodist Cemetery at Yeadon behind the Town Hall. James was a married man just 22 years old who 'died by an accident in the Bramhope Tunnel on the 14th day of April, 1848'. Next to him lies the body of his 3 years old daughter who died two weeks later of some unspecified illness. <small>Cllr Philip Sunderland</small><ref name="tunnel" />

=== Alcohol and water ===
[[Image:Bramhope 003.jpg|thumb|left|North portal in 2009]]
Drunkenness and fighting was such that Jos Midgeley, a railway police inspector, was hired for <U+00A3>1.25 per week to keep order. At one time he was attacked by a group of men, and at another there was a riot at Wescoe Hill in which a man died, all because the contractors tried to cut off the beer supply.<ref name="tunnel" />

Water was taken at first from Bramhope's town well, opposite St Giles Church, but the excessive demand diminished the supply and spoiled the quality. The tunnellers' water was then pumped from a site near the Dyneley Arms crossroads. But at the same time the tunnel itself was draining away the local farmers' natural [[irrigation]], and the source of Bramhope town well. Litigation on this subject continued for some years.<ref name="tunnel" />

=== Education and religion ===
The number of workers' children overwhelmed that of the local children in [[Bramhope]]'s school <U+2013> however this was before the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]] which provided for education for all, up to the age of 12 years.<ref name="EducationAct1870">{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/elementaryeducat00greauoft/elementaryeducat00greauoft_djvu.txt|title=Internet Archive|date=1870|work=Full text of "The Elementary Education Act, 1870, with introduction, notes, and index, and appendix containing the inforporrated statutes"|publisher=Shaw & Sons, Fetter Lane, London|accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref> Poor children would have been educated at the [[parochial school]] in Eastgate, where the memorial gardens are now.<ref name="BramhopeSeals2000">{{cite web|url=http://www.bramhope.org/brhistry.htm|title=Bramhope.org (Bramhope & Carlton Parish Council)|last=Seals|first=W.F.|date=10 October 2000|publisher=A Brief History of Bramhope (source: "A History of the Township of Bramhope")|accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref> The workers and their families attended St Ronans Methodist chapel at Bramhope, and the [[Methodism|Methodist]] chapel at [[Pool-in-Wharfedale]]. The Leeds Mission spread Bibles and tracts in the shanty<U+2013>town.<ref name="tunnel" />

== What is visible today ==
[[Image:Bramhope Tunnel north portal with train.jpg|thumb|right|North portal in 2007]]
Four of the twenty shafts remain as [[ventilation shaft]]s.  These are: the first to the north of the Leeds<U+2013>Otley A660 near the [[Scouting|Scout hut]] in Bramhope; the second behind Park House, Bramhope; the third opposite Camp House Farm and the fourth near [[Cookridge]] and Horsforth. The ventilation shafts measure {{convert|40|ft|m}} by {{convert|30|ft|m}} <U+2013> wider than the tunnel itself.<ref Name=timelines/>  One of the two sighting towers remains, in the field opposite Bramhope cemetery.  The other one, now demolished, was behind Dyneley Hall. {{convert|250000|cuyd|m3}} of [[earthworks (engineering)|spoil]] still lies along the line of the tunnel. One of a number of tips is in an area around the scout hut to the north of the Leeds<U+2013>Otley road; a second is the Knoll near to Parklands and on to the field facing Bramhope cemetery; a third is on land adjacent to None<U+2013>Go<U+2013>Byes Farm.<ref name="tunnel" />

=== North and south portals ===
[[Image:Bramhope 046.jpg|thumb|right|Sighting tower with horses showing relative height]]
The [[Gothic revival|Gothic]] north portal was said to have been built to please the landowner William Rhodes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lostrailwayswestyorkshire.co.uk/Leeds%20Harrogate.htm|title=Leeds to Harrogate 1849 <U+2013> Present North Eastern Railway|publisher=Lost Railways West Yorkshire|accessdate=2009-07-19}}</ref> who wanted to use one of the towers as a [[Belvedere (structure)|belvedere]]. It is built of rock<U+2013>faced [[sandstone]] and has three side towers with [[turret]]s, and a horseshoe<U+2013>shaped archway.  The [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] features a portrait of a bearded man who is said to resemble the aforesaid landowner. There is a crenellated parapet with a carved [[cartouche]] in the centre featuring a wheatsheaf, [[wool|fleece]] and fish.<ref Name=listing/> Both portals are on [[Network Rail]] land with no public access.<ref>The north portal can be seen at a distance from the nearby [[Rights of way in England and Wales|public footpath]], and glimpsed from the Leeds<U+2013>bound train when entering the tunnel. The south portal has no public access as it is in a cutting with no easy viewing point, and is quite difficult to glimpse from a train, which can now go through at {{convert|60|mph|km/h}}.</ref><!-- Please not that this reference is absolutely necessary, as this type of article could otherwise encourage trespassing near the railway line, or could lead to the misunderstanding that there is public access. -->
