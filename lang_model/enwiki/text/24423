"'''A Rugrats Passover'''" is the 26th episode of the third season of the American [[animated television series]] ''[[Rugrats]]'', and its 62nd episode overall. It was broadcast originally on April 13, 1995, on the cable network [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]. The plot follows series regulars [[List of Rugrats characters#Adults|Grandpa Boris]] and the babies as they become trapped in the attic on [[Passover]]; to pass the time, Boris tells the [[Jewish]] story of [[the Exodus]]. During the episode the babies themselves reenact the story, with young [[Tommy Pickles|Tommy]] portraying [[Moses]], while his cousin [[Angelica Pickles|Angelica]] represents the [[Pharaoh of Egypt]].

"A Rugrats Passover" was directed by Jim Duffy, Steve Socki, and Jeff McGrath from the script by [[Peter Gaffney]], [[Paul Germain]], Rachel Lipman, and Jonathon Greenberg. The episode was conceived in 1992 when Germain responded to a Nickelodeon request for a ''Rugrats'' [[Hannukah]] special by creating a Passover episode instead. The episode scored a 3.1 [[Nielsen Rating]], making it "the highest-rated show in Nickelodeon's history",<ref name="ratings">{{cite journal|title=Nickelodeon on a roll; Learning Station's bright idea|date=1995-10-14|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|page=66}}</ref> and received overwhelmingly positive reviews, including from Jewish community publications. It was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award]], an [[Annie Award]], and a [[CableACE Award]]. The episode also, however, attracted controversy, when the [[Anti-Defamation League]] compared the artistic design of the older characters to [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] drawings from a 1930s [[Nazism|Nazi]] newspaper.

The episode made ''Rugrats'' one of the first animated series to focus on a Jewish holiday; its success precipitated the creation of another special, "[[A Rugrats Chanukah]]", which also attracted critical acclaim. A novelization of the episode was in 2007 exhibited at the [[Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].

==Plot==
As the episode opens the Pickles family is gathering to celebrate the [[Passover]] [[Passover Seder|Seder]] at the home of [[List of Rugrats characters#Adults|Grandpa Boris and Grandma Minka]]. Following an argument with Minka about the type of wine glasses they should use, Boris storms out of the room; [[Didi Pickles|Didi]] arrives with her husband Stu and son [[Tommy Pickles|Tommy]] and tries to comfort her mother Minka. Boris has not reappeared by the time Tommy's friend [[Chuckie Finster|Chuckie]] and his father arrive to join the celebration; when the Seder begins the children set off to search for Boris, eventually finding him in the attic. Boris explains that he had gone in search of Minka's favorite wine glasses but had become trapped when the door closed behind him. Angelica, Tommy's older cousin, tests the door, and inadvertently locks them all in again.

To pass the time Boris decides to tell the children the story of [[the Exodus]], hoping to improve their understanding of Passover. As he talks Angelica imagines herself as the [[Pharaoh of Egypt]], who commands the [[Hebrew]]s to throw their newborn children into the [[Nile River]]. One Hebrew defies the order, putting baby [[Moses]] (imagined in the episode as Tommy) into a basket and setting it afloat on the river. The basket and baby are discovered by a servant of the Pharaoh; Angelica, as the Pharaoh, shows Moses around her palace and declares him her partner. As Boris explains that the Pharaoh was unaware Moses was a Hebrew, Chuckie's father Chas enters the attic, looking for the children, and becomes locked in with the rest of them. He sits down and listens as Boris continues: years later, Boris says, Moses stood up for an abused Hebrew slave (imagined in the narrative as Chuckie), and was outed as a Hebrew. The episode then pictures Tommy as Moses fleeing to the desert, where he becomes a shepherd and forgets about Egypt and the Pharaoh, until the voice of [[God]] calls to him from a burning bush, telling him that he must free the Hebrews from slavery. 

Moses confronts the Pharaoh and demands that she let the Hebrews be free. She refuses and calls her guards to drag Moses away; he curses her kingdom with terrible [[Plagues of Egypt|plagues]] until she relents and allows Moses to leave with the enslaved Hebrews. As Boris is explaining how the Pharaoh deceives the Hebrews and prevents them from leaving, Angelica's parents Drew and Charlotte arrive and become locked in with the others. Boris resumes the story: the Pharaoh's treachery causes Moses to curse her once more, this time with a plague on the first-born children of Egypt. The Pharaoh, being a first-born child, bargains with Moses: he can leave if he calls off the divine plague. Moses complies and leads the Hebrews out of Egypt, but the Pharaoh reneges on her promise and leads out her remaining army to pursue the Hebrews.

Minka, Didi, and Stu arrive in the attic to find the group enthralled by the end of Boris's story: Moses, cornered, calls down the power of God to part the [[Red Sea]], which the Hebrews are approaching. They pass through the parted waters, which then crash back together behind them, engulfing the Pharaoh and her army. With the story over, the family gets up to finish the Seder: only to see the wind blow shut the door, locking them all in. Boris decides to tell them another story, this time about his relatives.

As with other ''Rugrats'' episodes, "A Rugrats Passover" depicts "the innocence of a baby's perception of the world," emphasizing the young characters' intense, childlike reactions to their environment.<ref name="ledger">{{cite news|title=The powerful appeal of Rugrats: Cable TV's top children's show relays comforting values|work=[[The Ledger]]|author=Loftus, Mary J.|date=1996-11-26|accessdate=2010-01-06|page=D6}}</ref> Creator Klasky identified the episode's depiction of the Pickles family as "very loving, [and] basically functional"<ref name="ledger"/> as strikingly different from the prevailing trends in contemporary television programming.<ref name="ledger"/> Another episode element common to the series' broader themes is its treatment of Angelica's mother Charlotte, who throughout the episode is glued to her cell phone and engrossed in her business life, despite her professed desire to provide Angelica with an educational environment.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Rugrats' Real Mom and Dad|work=[[BusinessWeek]]|date=1995-10-16|pages=143<U+2013>144}}</ref>

===Anti-Defamation League controversy===
"A Rugrats Passover," along with other ''Rugrats'' episodes featuring Boris and Minka, attracted controversy when the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) claimed that the two characters resembled [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] drawings that had appeared in a 1930s [[Nazism|Nazi]] newspaper. [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]'s then-president [[Albie Hecht]], himself Jewish, professed himself dumbfounded by the criticism, calling it absurd.<ref name="controversy">{{cite book|title=How The Left Lost Teen Spirit|author=Goldberg, Danny|year=2005|publisher=Akashic Books|page=216|isbn=0971920680}}</ref> The controversy resurfaced in 1998 when the ADL criticized another appearance of Boris, this time reciting the [[Mourner's Kaddish]] in a ''Rugrats'' comic strip published in newspapers during the [[Jewish New Year]]. Unlike Hecht, Nickelodeon's new president [[Herb Scannell]] agreed with the criticism and apologized, promising never to run the character or the strip again.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue3.9/3.9pages/3.9business.html|title=Rugrats Offends Media Watchdogs|work=[[Animation World Magazine]]|author=Jackson, Wendy; Amidi, Amid|date=1998-12|accessdate=2009-12-19}}</ref>
