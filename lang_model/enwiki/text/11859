'''Hurricane Hilda''' was a strong [[Saffir<U+2013>Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3]] [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricane]] that was the second in a succession of three hurricanes to strike near [[Tampico]], [[Mexico]]. The eighth [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]] of the [[1955 Atlantic hurricane season]], Hilda formed from a [[tropical wave]] on September&nbsp;10 near the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It quickly intensified while moving westward into a small hurricane, and it crossed over southeastern [[Cuba]] on September&nbsp;13. There, it dropped heavy rainfall and produced gusty winds that destroyed 80% of the coffee crop in [[Oriente Province]]. In the eastern Cuban city of [[Baracoa]], Hilda severely damaged the oldest church in the country. Damage totaled $2&nbsp;million in Cuba, and there were four deaths. Later, the hurricane moved across the Caribbean Sea, causing light damage in the sparsely-populated region of the eastern [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]]. 

After reaching the Gulf of Mexico, Hilda strengthened to reach peak winds of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h) late on September&nbsp;18. Before the hurricane moved ashore, there was residual flooding in Tampico from earlier [[1955 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Gladys|Hurricane Gladys]]. Hilda struck the city early on September&nbsp;19, with gusts estimated at {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. It dropped heavy rainfall that flooded 90% of Tampico, while its strong winds damaged half of the homes, leaving 15,000&nbsp;homeless. The storm killed 300&nbsp;people and caused over $120&nbsp;million (1955&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]) in Mexico. Ongoing flooding caused an outbreak of [[dysentery]], and about 10&nbsp;days after Hilda struck, [[Hurricane Janet]] struck the same region and caused further flooding and damage. Collectively, the damage from the storms represented about half of Mexico's budget in 1955.

The origins of Hurricane Hilda were from an [[tropical wave|easterly wave]],<ref name="mwr">{{cite report|author=Gordon E. Dunn|author2=Walter R. Davis|author3=Paul L.

It was a small cyclone, and the strongest winds were in a small region around the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]].<ref name="mwr"/> Hilda continued to the west about {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} offshore northern [[Hispaniola]].<ref name="clim"/> After reaching winds of 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h), the hurricane weakened slightly while off the north coast of [[Haiti]]. Turning to the west-southwest, Hilda made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near the southeastern tip of [[Cuba]] on September&nbsp;13. While crossing the island into the [[Caribbean Sea]], it weakened from a hurricane into a tropical storm.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

On September&nbsp;14, Hilda emerged into the Caribbean Sea. It quickly re-intensified, surpassing its previous strength to winds of {{convert|115|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} by September&nbsp;15.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} The hurricane weakened slightly as it neared the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]], and Hilda struck the sparsely-populated area between [[Chetumal]] and [[Cozumel]] on September&nbsp;16 with winds of about {{convert|110|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}<ref name="mwr"/> It weakened slightly over the Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula, emerging into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on September&nbsp;17 with winds of about 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h). Hilda again re-intensified, reaching its [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h) late on September&nbsp;18.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} Early the next day, the hurricane made landfall near [[Tampico, Tamaulipas]] in northeastern Mexico. Winds in the city reached {{convert|105|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and the eye was observed for 45&nbsp;minutes. The lowest pressure in Tampico was {{convert|952|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} on September&nbsp;19.<ref name="mwr"/> Hilda rapidly weakened over land, turning to the west-southwest and dissipating on September&nbsp;20.<ref name="mwr"/>

Before the hurricane struck, residents in Mexico expected that Hurricane Hilda would be weaker and strike near Tampico. When the storm was announced via radio about three hours before landfall, most people were already asleep and unable to prepare.<ref name="asa">{{cite web|publisher=As<U+00ED> es Tampico|title=1955, the year that marked Tampico's History|accessdate=2013-01-20|url=http://www.asiestampico.com.mx/ap_552.htm}}</ref> Tides rose in advance of the storm, and before it made landfall, 10% of Tampico was still flooded from previous [[1955 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Gladys|Hurricane Gladys]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|title=Ione is Bypassing Florida|agency=Associated Press|date=1955-09-18|accessdate=2013-01-20|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DooeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fcsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=683,2178066&dq=hurricane+yucatan&hl=en}}</ref> In Tampico, Hilda's strong winds blew away an anemometer after the instrument recorded winds of {{convert|105|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}; peak winds were later estimated at around {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name="mwr"/> At the city's port, Hilda damaged boats and ferries, some of which washed out to sea.<ref name="asa"/> The hurricane destroyed the roofs of about half of the the city's houses, as well as several schools and large buildings.

After the storm, Tampico was left without power or communications.<ref name="asa"/> About 15,000&nbsp;people became homeless due to the storm, or previously from Hurricane Gladys. The governor of Tamaulipas declared a state of emergency and requested assistance from the military to provide food and shelter. Within a day after the storm, water access was restored, although the city initially remained without power or telephone. Communications were cut to Tampico, except for the airport at the radio.<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|date=1955-09-20|title=Hilda Leaves 15,000 Homeless, 12 Dead, 350 Hurt in Tampico|newspaper=The Free Lance-Star|accessdate=2013-01-20|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=M95LAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3ooDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4489,1088530&dq=hurricane+hilda&hl=en}}</ref> The rail line from [[Laredo, Texas]] to Mexico City was cut during the storm, but was restored ten days later.<ref>{{cite news|title=Floods Delay Reports of Janet's Mexico Toll|agency=Associated Press|date=1955-09-30|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|accessdate=2013-01-21|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hngcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5GQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4051,70280&dq=hurricane+hilda&hl=en}}</ref> Due to ongoing flood conditions, there was an outbreak of [[dysentery]] that killed two children.
