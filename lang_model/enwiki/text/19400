'''Edward VII''' (Albert Edward; 9 November 1841 <U+2013> 6 May 1910) was [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and the [[British Dominions]] and [[Emperor of India]] from 22 January 1901 until his death on 6 May 1910. He was the first [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] of the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], which was renamed the [[House of Windsor]] by his son, [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]].

Before his accession to the throne, Edward held the title of [[Prince of Wales]] and was [[heir apparent]] to the throne for longer than anyone else in history.<ref>He was heir apparent for 59 years, 2 months and 14 days. The current heir apparent, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], could surpass this on 21 April 2011. He was Prince of Wales for 59 years, 1 month and 13 days; Charles could surpass this on 9 September 2017.</ref> During the long widowhood of his mother, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], he was largely excluded from political power and came to personify the fashionable, leisured elite.

The [[Edwardian period]], which covered Edward's reign and was named after him, coincided with the start of a new century and heralded significant changes in technology and society, including [[powered flight]] and the rise of [[History of socialism in Great Britain|socialism]] and the Labour movement. Edward played a role in the modernisation of the [[British Home Fleet]], the reform of the [[Army Medical Services]],<ref name="royal">{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensoftheUnitedKingdom/Saxe-Coburg-Gotha/EdwardVII.aspx|title=Edward VII|publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> and the reorganisation of the British army after the [[Second Boer War]]. He fostered good relations between Great Britain and other European countries, especially France, for which he was popularly called "Peacemaker", but his relationship with his nephew, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II of Germany]], was poor. Edward presciently suspected that Wilhelm would precipitate a war, and four years after Edward's death, World War I brought an end to the Edwardian way of life.

==Early life==
Edward was born at 10:48 a.m. on 9 November 1841 in [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref>{{citation|last=Magnus|first=Philip|authorlink=Sir Philip Magnus-Allcroft, 2nd Baronet|title=King Edward The Seventh|publisher=John Murray|location=London|year=1964|page=1}}</ref> His mother was [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], the only daughter of [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]] and [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]]. His father was [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], first cousin and [[prince consort|consort]] of Victoria. He was christened '''Albert Edward''' (after his father and maternal grandfather) at [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], on 25 January 1842. His godparents were [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|the King of Prussia]], [[Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|his paternal grandfather]]'s wife [[Marie of W<U+00FC>rttemberg|the Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (for whom [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|the Duchess of Kent]], his maternal grandmother, stood proxy), his great-uncle [[Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge|the Duke of Cambridge]], [[Augustus, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg|his great-grandfather]]'s wife [[Karoline Amalie of Hesse-Kassel|the Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Altenburg]] (for whom [[Princess Augusta of Hesse-Cassel|the Duchess of Cambridge]], his great-aunt, stood proxy), his great-aunt [[Princess Sophia of the United Kingdom|the Princess Sophia]] (for whom [[Princess Augusta of Cambridge]], his first cousin once-removed, stood proxy) and his great-uncle [[Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=20065|linkeddate=28 January 1842|startpage=224}}</ref> He was known as '''Bertie''' to the family throughout his life.<ref>{{citation|last=Bentley-Cranch|first=Dana|title=Edward VII: Image of an Era 1841<U+2013>1910|publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office|location=London|year=1992|isbn=0112905080|page=1}}</ref>

As the eldest son of a British sovereign, he was automatically [[Duke of Cornwall]] and [[Duke of Rothesay]] at birth. As a son of Prince Albert, he also held the titles of Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Duke of Saxony. Queen Victoria created her son [[Prince of Wales]] and [[Earl of Chester]] on 8 December 1841. He was created [[Earl of Dublin]] on 17 January 1850, a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] on 9 November 1858, and a [[Order of the Thistle|Knight of the Thistle]] on 24 May 1867.<ref>{{citation|last=Weir|first=Alison|authorlink=Alison Weir (historian)|title=Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy, Revised Edition|publisher=Random House|location=London|year=1996|isbn=0712674489|page=319}}</ref> In 1863, he renounced his succession rights to the Duchy of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] in favour of his younger brother, [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred]].<ref>{{citation|first=John|last=Van der Kiste|authorlink=John Van der Kiste|title=Alfred, Prince, duke of Edinburgh (1844<U+2013>1900)|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher= Oxford University Press|date=September 2004; online edition May 2007|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/346|accessdate=24 June 2009|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/346}} (Subscription required)</ref>

==Education==
Queen Victoria and Prince Albert determined that their eldest son should have an education that would prepare him to be a model [[constitutional monarch]]. At age seven, Edward embarked upon a rigorous educational programme devised by Prince Albert, and under the supervision of several tutors. However, unlike [[Victoria, Princess Royal|his elder sister]], Edward did not excel in his studies. He tried to meet the expectations of his parents, but to no avail. Although Edward was not a diligent student<U+2014>his true talents were those of charm, sociability and tact<U+2014>[[Benjamin Disraeli]] described him as informed, intelligent and of sweet manner.<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 4</ref>

After an educational trip to Rome, undertaken in the first few months of 1859, he spent the summer of that year studying at the [[University of Edinburgh]] under, amongst others, [[Lyon Playfair]]. In October he matriculated as an undergraduate at [[Christ Church, Oxford]].<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 18</ref> Now released from the educational strictures imposed by his parents, he enjoyed studying for the first time and performed satisfactorily in examinations.<ref name="dnb">{{citation|first=H. C. G.|last=Matthew|authorlink=Colin Matthew|title=Edward VII (1841<U+2013>1910)|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/32975|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32975|date=September 2004; online edition May 2006|accessdate=24 June 2009}} (Subscription required)</ref> In 1861, Edward transferred to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],<ref>{{Venn|id=WLS861AE|name=Wales, H.R.H.

==Early adulthood==
[[Image:H.R.H. Prince of Wales and Suite at Point View, Niagara.jpg|thumb|right|Prince Edward at [[Niagara Falls]], 1860]]

In 1860, Edward undertook the first tour of North America by an heir to the British throne. His genial good humour and confident ''bonhomie'' made the tour a great success.<ref name="bc">Bentley-Cranch, pp. 20<U+2013>34</ref> He inaugurated the [[Victoria Bridge, Montreal]], across the [[St Lawrence River]], and laid the cornerstone of [[Parliament Hill, Ottawa]]. He watched [[Blondin]] traverse [[Niagara Falls]] by highwire, and stayed for three days with President [[James Buchanan]] at the [[White House]]. Buchanan accompanied the Prince to [[Mount Vernon]], to pay his respects at the tomb of [[George Washington]]. Vast crowds greeted him everywhere. He met [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]]. Prayers for the royal family were said in [[Trinity Church, New York]], for the first time since 1776.<ref name="bc" /> The four-month tour throughout Canada and the United States considerably boosted Edward's confidence and self-esteem, and had many diplomatic benefits for Great Britain.<ref>Hough, pp. 39<U+2013>47</ref>

Upon his return, Edward hoped to pursue a career in the [[British Army]], but this was denied him because he was heir to the throne. His military ranks were honorary. In September 1861, Edward was sent to Germany, supposedly to watch military manoeuvres, but actually in order to engineer a meeting between him and Princess [[Alexandra of Denmark]], the eldest daughter of [[Christian IX of Denmark|Prince Christian of Denmark]] and his wife [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Louise]]. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert had already decided that Edward and Alexandra should marry. They met at [[Speyer]] on 24 September under the auspices of his elder sister, [[Victoria, Princess Royal|the Crown Princess of Prussia]].<ref>Bentley-Cranch, pp. 36<U+2013>38</ref> Edward's elder sister, acting upon instructions from their mother, had met Princess Alexandra at [[Neustrelitz|Strelitz]] in June; the young Danish princess made a very favourable impression. Edward and Alexandra were friendly from the start; the meeting went well for both sides, and marriage plans advanced.<ref>Hough, pp. 64<U+2013>66</ref>

From this time, Edward gained a reputation as a playboy. Determined to get some army experience, Edward attended manoeuvres in Ireland, during which an actress, [[Nellie Clifton]], was hidden in his tent by his fellow officers. Prince Albert, though ill, was appalled and visited Edward at [[Cambridge]] to issue a reprimand. Albert died in December 1861 just two weeks after the visit. Queen Victoria was inconsolable, wore mourning clothes for the rest of her life and blamed Edward for his father's death. At first, she regarded her son with distaste as frivolous, indiscreet and irresponsible. She wrote to her eldest daughter, "I never can, or shall, look at him without a shudder."<ref>{{citation|last=Middlemas|first=Keith|coauthors=Edited by [[Antonia Fraser]]|title=The Life and Times of Edward VII|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|year=1972|page=31|isbn=0297831895}}</ref>

==Marriage==
{{House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|edward7}}

Once widowed, Queen Victoria effectively withdrew from public life. Shortly after Prince Albert's death, she arranged for Edward to embark on an extensive tour of the Middle East, visiting [[Egypt]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Damascus]], [[Beirut]] and [[Constantinople]].<ref>Bentley-Cranch, pp. 40<U+2013>42</ref> As soon as he returned to Britain, preparations were made for his engagement, which was sealed at [[Laeken]] in Belgium on 9 September 1862.<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 44</ref> Edward and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]] married at [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], on 10 March 1863. Edward was 21; Alexandra was 18.

[[Image:King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra - Wedding -1863 -cropped.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Prince Albert Edward and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra]] at their wedding. [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], 1863]]

Edward and his wife established [[Marlborough House]] as their London residence and [[Sandringham House]] in [[Norfolk]] as their country retreat. They entertained on a lavish scale. Their marriage met with disapproval in certain circles because most of Queen Victoria's relations were German, and Denmark was at loggerheads with Germany over the territories of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. When Alexandra's father inherited the throne of Denmark in November 1863, the [[German Confederation]] took the opportunity to [[Second Schleswig War|invade and annex Schleswig-Holstein]]. Queen Victoria was of two minds whether it was a suitable match given the political climate.<ref>Middlemas, p. 35</ref> After the couple's marriage, she expressed anxiety about their socialite lifestyle and attempted to dictate to them on various matters, including the names of their children.

Edward had mistresses throughout his married life. He socialised with actress [[Lillie Langtry]]; [[Jennie Jerome|Lady Randolph Churchill]] (mother of [[Winston Churchill]]);<ref>Letters written by Edward to Lady Randolph may have "signified no more than a flirtation" but were "[w]ritten in a strain of undue familiarity" ({{citation|last=Hattersley|first=Roy|authorlink=Roy Hattersley|title=The Edwardians|publisher=Little, Brown|location=London|year=2004|page=21|isbn=0316725374}}).</ref> [[Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick]]; actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]]; noblewoman [[Susan Pelham-Clinton]]; singer [[Hortense Schneider]]; prostitute Giulia Barucci; wealthy humanitarian [[Agnes Keyser]]; and [[Alice Keppel]]. At least fifty-five liaisons are conjectured.<ref>{{citation|last=Camp|first=Anthony|title=Royal Mistresses and Bastards: Fact and Fiction, 1714<U+2013>1936|year=2007}}. They are listed at http://anthonyjcamp.com/page9.htm.</ref> How far these relationships went is not always clear. Edward always strove to be discreet, but this did not prevent society gossip or press speculation.<ref>Middlemas, pp. 74<U+2013>80</ref> One of Alice Keppel's great-granddaughters, [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla Parker Bowles]], became the wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], one of Edward's great-great grandsons. It was rumoured that Camilla's grandmother, [[Sonia Cubitt, Baroness Ashcombe|Sonia Keppel]] (born in May 1900), was the illegitimate daughter of Edward, but she was "almost certainly" the daughter of [[George Keppel (soldier)|George Keppel]], whom she resembled.<ref>{{citation|first=Diana|last=Souhami|title=Mrs Keppel and her daughter|location=London|publisher=HarpurCollins|year=1996|page=49}}</ref> Edward never acknowledged any illegitimate children.<ref>{{citation|first=Mike|last=Ashley|authorlink=Mike Ashley (writer)|title=The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens|publisher=Robinson|location=London|year=1998|pages=694<U+2013>695|isbn=1 841 19096 9}}</ref> Alexandra is believed to have been aware of many of his affairs and to have accepted them.<ref>Middlemas, p. 89</ref>

In 1869, [[Charles Mordaunt (1836-1897)|Sir Charles Mordaunt]], a British [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]], threatened to name Edward as co-respondent in his divorce suit. Ultimately, he did not do so but Edward was called as a witness in the case in early 1870. It was shown that Edward had visited the Mordaunts' house while Sir Charles was away sitting in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Although nothing further was proven and Edward denied he had committed adultery, the suggestion of impropriety was damaging.<ref name="dnb" /><ref>{{citation|last=Priestley|first=J. B.|authorlink= J.

==Heir apparent==
During Queen Victoria's widowhood, Edward represented her at public ceremonies and gatherings<U+2014>for example, opening [[Halifax Town Hall]] in 1863,<ref>{{citation|author=Holdsworth, David W.|date=January 2004|url=http://story.theholdsworths.org.uk/pages/halifax_town_hall.html|title=Halifax Town Hall|publisher=David W.

[[File:TeDeumIllust.jpg|thumb|right|Victoria visits Edward during his illness.]]
In 1870, republican sentiment in Britain was given a boost when the French Emperor, [[Napoleon III]], was defeated in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the [[French Third Republic]] was declared.<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 66</ref> However, in the winter of 1871, a brush with death led to an improvement both in Edward's popularity with the public as well as in his relationship with his mother. While staying at Londesborough Lodge, near [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire]], Edward contracted [[typhoid]], the disease that was believed to have killed his father. There was great national concern, and one of his fellow guests ([[George Stanhope, 7th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]]) died. Edward's recovery was greeted with almost universal relief.<ref name="dnb" /> Public celebrations included the composition of [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s [[Festival Te Deum]]. Edward cultivated politicians from all parties, including republicans, as his friends, and thereby largely dissipated any residual feelings against him.<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 67 and Middlemas, pp. 48<U+2013>52</ref>

In 1875, Edward set off for India on an extensive eight-month tour of the sub-continent. His advisors remarked on his habit of treating all people the same, regardless of their social station or colour. In letters home, he complained of the treatment of the native Indians by the British officials: "Because a man has a black face and a different religion from our own, there is no reason why he should be treated as a brute."<ref>Bentley-Cranch, pp. 101<U+2013>102</ref> At the end of the tour, his mother was given the title Empress of India by Parliament, in part as a result of the tour's success.<ref name=bc104>Bentley-Cranch, p. 104</ref>

Edward was a patron of the arts and sciences and helped found the [[Royal College of Music]]. He opened the college in 1883 with the words, "Class can no longer stand apart from class&nbsp;... I claim for music that it produces that union of feeling which I much desire to promote."<ref name=bc104/> At the same time, he enjoyed gambling and country sports and was an enthusiastic hunter. He ordered all the clocks at Sandringham to run half an hour fast to create more time for shooting. This so-called tradition of [[Sandringham Time]] continued until 1936, when it was abolished by [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]].<ref name="duke">{{citation|last=Windsor|first=HRH The Duke of|authorlink=Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|title=A King's Story|publisher=Cassell and Co|location=London|year=1951|page=46}}</ref> He also laid out a golf course at Windsor. By the 1870s the future king had taken a keen interest in horseracing and steeplechasing. In 1896, his horse [[Persimmon (horse)|Persimmon]] won both the [[Epsom Derby|Derby Stakes]] and the [[St. Leger Stakes]]. In 1900, Persimmon's brother, [[Diamond Jubilee (horse)|Diamond Jubilee]], won five races (Derby, St. Leger, [[2,000 Guineas Stakes]], [[Newmarket Stakes]] and [[Eclipse Stakes]])<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 110</ref> and another of Edward's horses, Ambush II, won the [[Grand National]].<ref>Middlemas, p. 98</ref>

He was regarded worldwide as an arbiter of men's fashions.<ref>{{citation|last=Bergner Hurlock|first=Elizabeth|title=The psychology of dress: an analysis of fashion and its motive|publisher=Ayer Publishing|year=1976|isbn=9780405086441|page=108}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last=Mansel|first=Philip|authorlink=Philip Mansel|title=Dressed to Rule|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=138|year=2005|isbn=0300106971}}</ref> He made wearing [[Tweed (cloth)|tweed]], [[Homburg hat]]s and [[Norfolk jacket]]s fashionable, and popularised the wearing of black ties with dinner jackets, instead of [[white tie]] and tails.<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 84</ref> He pioneered the pressing of trouser legs from side to side in preference to the now normal front and back creases,<ref>Middlemas, p. 201</ref> and was thought to have introduced the stand-up turn-down shirt collar.<ref>{{citation|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=OW18981103.2.164|title=Try our "98'Curzons!"

In 1891, Edward was embroiled in the [[Royal Baccarat Scandal]], when it was revealed he had played an illegal card game for money the previous year. The Prince was forced to appear as a witness in court for a second time when one of the players unsuccessfully sued his fellow players for slander after being accused of cheating.<ref>Hattersley, pp. 23<U+2013>25</ref> In the same year Edward was involved in a personal conflict, when [[Lord Charles Beresford]] threatened to reveal details of Edward's private life to the press, as a protest against Edward interfering with Beresford's affair with Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick. The friendship between the two men was irreversibly damaged and their bitterness would last for the remainder of their lives.<ref>Middlemas, p. 86</ref> Usually, Edward's outbursts of temper were short-lived, and "after he had let himself go&nbsp;... [he would] smooth matters by being especially nice".<ref>Sir [[Frederick Ponsonby, 1st Baron Sysonby]] quoted in Middlemas, p. 188</ref>

In 1892, Edward's eldest son, Albert Victor, was engaged to [[Mary of Teck|Princess Victoria Mary of Teck]]. Just a few weeks after the engagement, Albert Victor died of pneumonia. Edward was grief-stricken. "To lose our eldest son", he wrote, "is one of those calamities one can never really get over". Edward told Queen Victoria, "[I would] have given my life for him, as I put no value on mine".<ref>Middlemas, pp. 95<U+2013>96</ref> Albert Victor was the second of Edward's children to die. In 1871, his youngest son, John, had died just 24 hours after being born. Edward had insisted on placing John in his coffin personally with "the tears rolling down his cheeks".<ref>Battiscombe, p. 112</ref>

On his way to Denmark through Belgium on 4 April 1900 Edward was the victim of an attempted assassination, when [[Jean-Baptiste Sipido]] shot at him in protest over the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]]. Sipido escaped to France; the perceived delay of the Belgian authorities in applying for extradition, combined with British disgust at Belgian atrocities in the [[Belgian Congo|Congo]], worsened the already poor relationship between the United Kingdom and the Continent. However, in the next ten years, Edward's affability and popularity, as well as his use of family connections, assisted Britain in building European alliances.<ref>Middlemas, p. 65</ref>

==Accession==
[[File:Edward VII in coronation robes.jpg|thumb|right|King Edward VII in coronation robes. Note the Royal Sceptre in its original form, shortly before the addition of the [[Cullinan Diamond|Cullinan I Diamond]].]]
When Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901, Edward became King of the United Kingdom, Emperor of India and, in an innovation, King of the [[British Dominions]].<ref>Middlemas, p. 104</ref> He chose to reign under the name Edward VII, instead of Albert Edward<U+2014>the name his mother had intended for him to use,<ref>No English or British sovereign has ever reigned under a double name.</ref> declaring that he did not wish to "undervalue the name of Albert" and diminish the status of his father with whom among royalty the name Albert should stand alone.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27270|date=23 January 1901|startpage=547|supp=y}}</ref> The number VII was occasionally omitted in Scotland, even by the [[Church of Scotland|national church]], in deference to protests that the previous Edwards were English kings who had "been excluded from Scotland by battle".<ref name="dnb" /> [[J.

Edward VII and Alexandra were crowned at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 9 August 1902 by the 80-year-old [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Frederick Temple]], who died only four months later. Edward's coronation had originally been scheduled for 26 June, but two days before on 24 June, Edward was diagnosed with [[appendicitis]]. Thanks to developments in [[anaesthesia]] and [[antisepsis]] in the preceding 50 years, he underwent a life-saving operation, performed by Sir [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]]. This was at a time when appendicitis was generally not treated operatively and carried a high mortality rate.<ref>{{citation|author=Mirilas, P. ; Skandalakis, J.E.|year=2003|title=Not just an appendix: Sir Frederick Treves|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|volume=88|pages=549<U+2013>552|doi=10.1136/adc.88.6.549|pmid=12765932|issue=6|pmc=1763108}}</ref> Treves, with the support of [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Lord Lister]], performed a then-radical operation of draining the infected appendix through a small incision. The next day, Edward was sitting up in bed, smoking a cigar.<ref>The Duke of Windsor, p. 20</ref> Two weeks later, it was announced that the King was out of danger. Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which Edward had arranged before the operation)<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 127</ref> and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream.

Edward refurbished the royal palaces, reintroduced the traditional ceremonies, such as the [[State Opening of Parliament]], that his mother had forgone, and founded new [[Order (honour)|orders of honours]], such as the [[Order of Merit]], to recognise contributions to the arts and sciences.<ref>Bentley-Cranch, pp. 122<U+2013>139</ref> In 1902, the Shah of Persia, [[Mozzafar al-Din Shah|Mozzafar-al-Din]], visited England expecting to receive the [[Order of the Garter]]. Edward refused to give this high honour to the Shah because the order was meant to be his personal gift and the [[Foreign Secretary]], [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]], had promised the order without his consent. Edward also objected to inducting a [[Muslim]] into a [[Christian]] order of chivalry. His refusal threatened to damage British attempts to gain influence in Persia,<ref>Hattersley, pp. 39<U+2013>40</ref> but Edward resented his ministers' attempts to reduce the King's traditional powers. Eventually, he relented and Britain sent a special embassy to the Shah with a full Order of the Garter the following year.<ref>Middlemas, pp. 125<U+2013>126</ref>

=="Uncle of Europe"==
[[Image:EdwardVII at Balmoral.jpg|thumbnail|right|Edward VII relaxing at Balmoral, photographed by his wife, Alexandra]]

As king, Edward's main interests lay in the fields of foreign affairs and naval and military matters. Fluent in French and German, he made a number of visits abroad, and took annual holidays in [[Biarritz]] and [[Marienbad]].<ref name="duke" /> One of his most important foreign trips was an official visit to France in spring 1903 as the guest of President [[<U+00C9>mile Loubet]]. Following a visit to the [[Pope Leo XIII|Pope]] in Rome, this trip helped create the atmosphere for the Anglo-French [[Entente Cordiale]], an agreement delineating British and French colonies in North Africa, and ruling out any future war between the two countries. The Entente was negotiated between the French foreign minister, [[Th<U+00E9>ophile Delcass<U+00E9>]], and the British foreign secretary, [[Henry Charles Keith Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne, 6th Earl of Kerry|Lord Lansdowne]]. Signed on 8 April 1904 by Lansdowne and the French ambassador [[Paul Cambon]], it marked the end of centuries of Anglo-French rivalry and Britain's [[splendid isolation]] from Continental affairs, and attempted to counterbalance the growing dominance of the German Empire and its ally, Austria-Hungary.<ref>{{citation|author=Nicolson, Harold|authorlink=Harold Nicolson|date=October 1954|title=The Origins and Development of the Anglo-French Entente|journal=International Affairs|publisher=[[Royal Institute of International Affairs]]|volume=XXX|issue=4|pages=407<U+2013>416}}</ref>

Edward was related to nearly every other European monarch and came to be known as the "uncle of Europe".<ref name="royal" /> [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|The German Emperor Wilhelm II]], [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II of Russia]], [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse|Grand Duke Ernest Louis of Hesse]], [[Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Duke Charles Edward of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], and [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick|Duke Ernst August of Brunswick]] were Edward's nephews; [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg|Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain]], [[Princess Margaret of Connaught|Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden]], [[Marie of Edinburgh|Crown Princess Marie of Romania]], [[Sophie of Prussia|Crown Princess Sophia of Greece]], [[Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra of Russia]], [[Princess Alexandra of Hanover (1882<U+2013>1963)|Grand Duchess Alexandra of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], and [[Princess Charlotte of Prussia|Duchess Charlotte of Saxe-Meiningen]] were his nieces; [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII of Norway]] was both his nephew by marriage and his son-in-law; [[George I of Greece|King George I of Greece]] and [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|King Frederick VIII of Denmark]] were his brothers-in-law; [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert I of Belgium]], [[Charles I of Portugal|King Charles I]] and [[Manuel II of Portugal|King Manuel II of Portugal]], and [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria]] were his second cousins. Edward doted on his grandchildren, and indulged them, to the consternation of their governesses.<ref>The Duke of Windsor, p. 15</ref> However, there was one relation whom Edward did not like and his difficult relationship with his nephew, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], exacerbated the tensions between Germany and Britain.<ref>Middlemas, pp. 60<U+2013>61 and pp. 172<U+2013>175; Hattersley, pp. 460<U+2013>464</ref>

In 1908, Edward became the first British monarch to visit the [[Russian Empire]], despite refusing to visit in 1906, when Anglo-Russian relations were strained in the aftermath of the [[Dogger Bank incident]], the [[Russo-Japanese war]] and the Tsar's dissolution of the [[Duma]].<ref>Middlemas, pp. 167, 169</ref>

==Political controversies==
Edward involved himself heavily in discussions over army reform, the need for which had become apparent with the failings of the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]]. He supported the re-design of army command, the creation of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]], and the decision to provide an Expeditionary Force supporting France in the event of war with Germany.<ref>Middlemas, pp. 130<U+2013>134</ref> Reform of the Royal Navy was also suggested, partly due to the ever-increasing Naval Estimates, and because of the emergence of the [[Kaiserliche Marine|Imperial German Navy]] as a new strategic threat.<ref>{{citation|last=Kennedy|first=Paul M.|authorlink=Paul Kennedy|title=The Rise and Fall of British Naval Mastery|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|year=2004|pages=215<U+2013>216}}</ref> Ultimately a dispute arose between Admiral [[Lord Charles Beresford]], who favoured increased spending and a broad deployment, and the [[First Sea Lord]] Admiral Sir [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John Fisher]], who favoured efficiency savings, scrapping obsolete vessels, and a strategic realignment of the Royal Navy relying on torpedo craft for home defence backed by the new [[dreadnought]]s.<ref>See, principally, {{citation|last=Lambert|first=Nicholas A.|title=Sir John Fisher's Naval Revolution|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, South Carolina|year=2002|isbn=1570034923}} For a much shorter summary of Fisher's reforms, see {{citation|last=Grove|first=Eric J.|authorlink=Eric Grove|title=The Royal Navy since 1815|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|year=2005|isbn=0333721268|pages=88<U+2013>100}}</ref> Edward lent support to Fisher, in part because he disliked Beresford, and eventually Beresford was dismissed. Beresford continued his campaign outside of the navy and Fisher ultimately announced his resignation in late 1909, although the bulk of his policies were retained.<ref>Middlemas, pp. 134<U+2013>139</ref> The King was intimately involved in the appointment of Fisher's successor as the Fisher-Beresford feud had split the service, and the only truly-qualified figure known to be outside of both camps was [[Arthur Wilson (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Arthur Knyvet Wilson]], who had retired in 1907.<ref>Lambert, pp. 200<U+2013>201.</ref> Wilson was reluctant to return to active duty, but Edward persuaded him to do so, and Wilson became First Sea Lord on 25 January 1910.<ref>{{citation|last=Bradford|first=Admiral Sir Edward E.|authorlink=Edward Eden Bradford|title=Life of Admiral of the Fleet Sir Arthur Knyvet Wilson|publisher=John Murray|location=London|year=1923|pages=223<U+2013>225}}</ref>

In the last year of his life, Edward became embroiled in a constitutional crisis when the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] majority in the [[House of Lords]] refused to pass the "[[People's Budget]]" proposed by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government of Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]]. The King let Asquith know that he would only be willing to appoint additional peers, if necessary, to enable the budget's passage in the House of Lords, if Asquith won two successive general elections.<ref name="dnb" /><ref>Hattersley, p. 168</ref>

Edward was rarely interested in politics, although his views on some issues were notably liberal for the time. During his reign he said use of the word "[[nigger]]" was "disgraceful" despite it then being in common parlance.<ref>{{citation|last=Rose|first=Kenneth|authorlink=Kenneth Rose|title=King George V|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|year=1983|page=65}}</ref> While Prince of Wales, he had to be dissuaded from breaking with constitutional precedent by openly voting for [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]'s [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Representation of the People Bill]] in the [[House of Lords]]. On other matters he was less progressive<U+2014>he did not favour [[Irish Home Rule]] (initially preferring a form of [[dual monarchy]]) or giving [[Women's suffrage|votes to women]],<ref name="dnb" /><ref>Hattersley, pp. 215<U+2013>216</ref> although he did suggest that the social reformer [[Octavia Hill]] serve on the Commission for Working Class Housing.<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 98</ref> Edward lived a life of luxury that was often far removed from that of the majority of his subjects. However, his personal charm with people at all levels of society and his strong condemnation of prejudice went some way to assuage republican and racial tensions building during his lifetime.<ref name="dnb" />

==Death==
[[Image:Funeral of Edward VII -1910 -cropped.JPG|thumb|[[Funeral of Edward VII|Funeral procession of King Edward VII]]. Windsor, 1910]]

Edward usually smoked twenty cigarettes and twelve cigars a day. Towards the end of his life he increasingly suffered from [[bronchitis]].<ref name="dnb" /> In March 1910, the King was staying at [[Biarritz]] when he collapsed. He remained there to convalesce, while in London Asquith tried to get the Finance Bill passed. The King's continued ill-health was unreported and he attracted criticism for staying in France whilst political tensions were so high. On 27 April he returned to Buckingham Palace, still suffering from severe bronchitis. Alexandra returned from visiting her brother, King [[George I of Greece]], in [[Corfu]] a week later on 5 May.

The following day, the King suffered several heart attacks, but refused to go to bed saying, "No, I shall not give in; I shall go on; I shall work to the end."<ref name="p151">Bentley-Cranch, p. 151</ref> Between moments of faintness, the Prince of Wales (shortly to be [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]) told him that his horse, Witch of the Air, had won at [[Kempton Park Racecourse|Kempton Park]] that afternoon. The King replied, "I am very glad": his final words.<ref name="dnb" /> At half-past-eleven he lost consciousness for the last time and was put to bed. He died at 11:45 p.m.<ref name="p151" />

The story that Queen Alexandra invited Edward's last mistress, society beauty [[Alice Keppel]], to the King's death-bed<ref>Priestley, pp. 18, 180</ref> is a myth that Alice herself propagated. In reality Alice was, most reluctantly, asked at the King's request and, in a wild fit of hysterics, she was ejected shrieking, "I never did any harm, there was nothing wrong between us. What is to become of me?"<ref>{{citation|first=Theo|last=Aronson|authorlink=Theo Aronson|title=The King in Love: Edward VII's mistresses|location=London|publisher=John Murray|year=1988|pages=251<U+2013>253}}; {{citation|first=Raymond|last=Lamont-Brown|title=Edward VII's Last Loves|location=Stroud|publisher=Sutton Publishing|year=1998|page=131}}</ref>

[[File:King Edward VII 0918.jpg|thumb|Statue of Edward VII in [[Queen Victoria Gardens, Melbourne]]]]
[[Image:Parque Eduardo Setimo.JPG|thumb|The public park in Lisbon, named after Edward VII]]

Statues of Edward can be found throughout the former empire, such as those in Waterloo Place, London, [[Union Street, Aberdeen]], [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park, Toronto]], [[North Terrace, Adelaide]], Franklin Square, [[Hobart]], [[Queen Victoria Gardens, Melbourne]], and outside the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney]].

The [[HMS King Edward VII|lead ship]] of a new class of battleships, launched in 1903, was named in his honour. Many schools in England are named after Edward; two of the largest are in [[King Edward VII School (Melton Mowbray)|Melton Mowbray]] and [[King Edward VII School (Sheffield)|Sheffield]]. [[Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College and King Edward Memorial Hospital|King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital]] in India, the [[King Edward Medical University]] in Pakistan, [[King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women]] in [[Subiaco, Western Australia]], and [[King Edward VII Hall]] at the [[National University of Singapore]] carry King Edward's name. The [[Parque Eduardo VII]] in Lisbon, [[King Edward Avenue]] in [[Vancouver]], Rue Edouard VII in Paris and King Edward Cigars are also named after him.

As king, Edward VII proved a greater success than anyone had expected, but he was already an old man and had little time left to fulfil the role. In his short reign, he ensured that his second son and heir, George V, was better prepared to take the throne. Contemporaries described their relationship as more like affectionate brothers than father and son,<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 155</ref> and on Edward's death George wrote in his diary that he had lost his "best friend and the best of fathers&nbsp;... I never had a [cross] word with him in my life. I am heart-broken and overwhelmed with grief".<ref>King George V's diary, 6 May 1910. Royal Archives</ref> Edward received criticism for his apparent pursuit of self-indulgent pleasure but he received great praise for his affable and kind good manners, and his diplomatic skill. As his grandson wrote, "his lighter side&nbsp;... obscured the fact that he had both insight and influence."<ref>The Duke of Windsor, p. 69</ref> "He had a tremendous zest for pleasure but he also had a real sense of duty", wrote J. B. Priestley.<ref>Priestley, p. 25</ref> [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] wrote that Edward was "kind and debonair and not undignified <U+2013> but too human".<ref>Hattersley, p. 17</ref> Edward VII is buried at [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]]. As [[Barbara Tuchman]] noted in ''[[The Guns of August]]'', [[Funeral of Edward VII|his funeral]] marked "the greatest assemblage of royalty and rank ever gathered in one place and, of its kind, the last".

Edward had been afraid that his nephew, the German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], would tip Europe into war.<ref>Middlemas, pp. 176, 179</ref> Four years after Edward's death, World War I broke out. The naval reforms and the Anglo-French alliance he had supported, as well as the relationships between his extended royal family, were put to the test. The war marked the end of the Edwardian way of life.
