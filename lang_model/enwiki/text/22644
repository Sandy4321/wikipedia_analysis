'''''Searching for Bobby Fischer''''' is an acclaimed [[1993]] [[film]] based on the life of [[prodigy (chess)|prodigy]] [[chess]] player [[Joshua Waitzkin]], played by [[Max Pomeranc]]. Adapted from the book of the same name by Joshua's father Fred, the film was written and directed by [[Steven Zaillian]]. In the United Kingdom the film was released under the title '''''Innocent Moves'''''.

In this film, Josh Waitzkin's family discovers that he possesses a gift for [[chess]] and they seek to nurture it. They hire a strict instructor, [[Bruce Pandolfini]] (played by [[Ben Kingsley]]) who aims to teach the boy to be as aggressive as [[Bobby Fischer]].  The title of the film is a [[metaphor]] about the character's quest to adopt the ideal of Fischer and his determination to win at any price. The main conflict in the film arises when Josh refuses to adopt Fischer's misanthropic frame of reference.  Josh then goes on to win on his own terms with the kind of gracious [[sportsmanship]] that Fischer rejects.  

The film was nominated for Best Cinematography (Conrad L. Hall) at the 1993 [[Academy Awards]].  It won the category at the [[American Society of Cinematographers]] the same year.  The film also ranked #96 in [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Cheers]].

Some famous chess players have brief cameos in the film: [[Joel Benjamin]], [[Roman Dzindzichashvili]], [[Kamran Shirazi]], along with the real [[Joshua Waitzkin]], [[Bruce Pandolfini]], and Vincent Livermore. Chess master [[Asa Hoffmann]] is played by Austin Pendleton; the real Hoffman didn't like the way he was portrayed (his dialogue is taken almost verbatim from the nonfiction book, but the manner in which he delivers his line is different). Chess expert [[Poe McClinton]], still a park regular, is seen throughout the film. [[Pal Benko]] was supposed to be in the movie, but his part was cut out. Waitzkin's real mother and sister also have cameos in the film.

The Russian player in the park, played by Vasek Simek, who holds up the sign "For $5 a photo or a game with the man who beat [[Mikhail Tal|Tal]]," was based on the real life of [[Israel Zilber]].<ref>Wall, Bill.

At the end of the movie, Josh is seen playing a tough opponent named Jonathan Poe in the final tournament.  The character Jonathan Poe was not the actual name of Josh's opponent, however.  His real name was Jeff Sarwer (a boy younger than Josh).  Near the end of the game, where Josh offers Poe a [[draw (chess)|draw]], Poe rejects the draw and play continues.  Sarwer rejected the draw in the real world as well.  Josh played Sarwer to a draw (the two kings were the only pieces left on the board), and he kept the championship, as he was top seed.  The actual moves are available at http://jeffsarwer.com/chess.php .

Depicted to the right is the position of the game before Josh offers Poe the draw.  The position did not occur in the real Waitzkin-Sarwer game; it was contrived by Josh Waitzkin and Bruce Pandolfini specifically for the movie.  The following moves are executed:

#...gxf6
#Bxf6 Rc6+
#Kf5 Rxf6+!
#Nxf6 Bxf6
#Kxf6 Nd7+
#Kf5 Nxe5
#Kxe5?? a5
#h5 a4
#h6 a3
#h7 a2
#h8=Q a1=Q+
#Kf5 Qxh8 0-1

In the October 1995 issue of ''[[Chess Life]]'', [[International Grandmaster|Grandmaster]] [[Larry Evans]] stated that the position and sequence were unsound; Jonathan could still have drawn (note the double question marks after White's move 7, signifying a [[Blunder (chess)|serious blunder]]).  White could have drawn the game by advancing his [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] on move 7 instead of taking the [[knight (chess)|knight]].
