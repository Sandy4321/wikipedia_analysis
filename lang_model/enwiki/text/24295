The '''global warming controversy''' concerns the debate over the existence of [[global warming]], its causes and [[Effects of global warming|effects]], and what to do about it. In the [[scientific literature]], there is a [[scientific opinion on climate change|strong consensus]] that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused primarily by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.<ref name="OreskesBeyondTheIvoryTower"/><ref name = "AmericasClimateChoices-2010-SciPanel" /><ref name="USNAS-2008-ClimateChoices" /> No scientific body of national or international standing [[Scientific opinion on climate change#Statements by dissenting organizations|disagrees with this view]],<ref name=AQAonAAPG>{{cite journal|author=Julie Brigham-Grette|title=Petroleum Geologists' Award to Novelist Crichton Is Inappropriate|journal=[[Eos (journal)|Eos]]|volume=87|issue=36|quote=The AAPG stands alone among scientific societies in its denial of human-induced effects on global warming.|url=http://www.agu.org/fora/eos/pdfs/2006EO360008.pdf|month=September | year=2006|accessdate=23 January 2007|format=PDF|author-separator=,|display-authors=1|author2=<Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.>}}</ref> though a few organizations hold [[Scientific opinion on climate change#Non-committal statements|non-committal positions]].<ref name="The MIT Press">{{cite book |title= Climate Change: What It Means for Us, Our Children, and Our Grandchildren|last1= DiMento|first1= Joseph F.

Primary issues concerning the existence and cause of climate change include the reasons for the increase in [[instrumental temperature record|global average air temperature]], whether the warming trend is unprecedented or within normal climatic variations, whether [[attribution of recent climate change|humankind has contributed significantly to it]], and whether the increase is wholly or partially an artifact of poor measurements. Scientists have resolved many of these questions decisively in favour of the view that the warming trend is unprecedented, that human activity is the primary cause and that it has been accurately measured. Additional disputes have concerned estimates of [[climate sensitivity]], predictions of additional warming, and what the [[Effects of global warming|consequences of global warming]] will be. Although the primary issues are regarded in the scientific literature as settled, these secondary issues are still the subject of mainstream scientific debate. 

Global warming remains an issue of widespread political debate, sometimes split along party political lines, especially in the United States. Many of the largely settled scientific issues, such as the human responsibility for global warming, remain the subject of politically motivated attempts to downplay, dismiss or deny them <U+2013> a phenomenon widely known as [[climate change denial]]. The sources of funding for those involved with climate science <U+2013> both supporting and [[List of scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming|opposing mainstream scientific positions]] <U+2013> have been questioned by both sides. There are debates about the best [[Climate change mitigation|policy responses to the science]], their cost-effectiveness and their urgency. Climate scientists, especially in the US, have reported [[Politicization_of_science#Global_warming|official and oil-industry pressure]] to [[Climate change denial|censor or suppress their work]] and hide scientific data, with directives not to discuss the subject in public communications. Legal cases regarding global warming, its effects, and measures to reduce it, have reached American courts. The [[energy lobby]], oil industry advocates and [[free market]] [[think tank]]s have often been accused of overtly or covertly supporting efforts to undermine or discredit the scientific consensus on global warming.

=== Public opinion ===
{{Main|Public opinion on climate change|Media coverage of climate change}}
In the [[United States]], the mass media devoted little coverage to global warming until the [[drought]] of 1988, and [[James E. Hansen]]'s testimony to the [[United States Senate|Senate]], which explicitly attributed "the abnormally hot weather plaguing our nation" to global warming.<ref name = "McCrightDunlap2000p500">{{cite journal |author=McCright, A.M.; Dunlap R.E. |title=Challenging global warming as a social problem: An analysis of the conservative movement's counter-claims |journal=Social problems |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=499<U+2013>522 |year=2000 |jstor=3097132 |url=http://www.climateaccess.org/sites/default/files/McCright_Challenging%20Global%20Warming.pdf |format=PDF }} See p.&nbsp;500.</ref> 

The British press also changed its coverage at the end of 1988, following a speech by [[Margaret Thatcher]] to the [[Royal Society]] advocating action against human-induced climate change.<ref>Speech to the Royal Society (27 September 1988), [http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=107346 Public Statement, Speech Archive], ''Margaret Thatcher Foundation''.

Many European countries took action to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions before 1990. [[West Germany]] started to take action after the [[Green Party (Germany)|Green Party]] took seats in Parliament in the 1980s. All countries of the [[European Union]] ratified the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]]. 

Substantial activity by [[NGO]]s took place as well.<ref>{{cite book|pages=265<U+2013>272|title=Confronting climate change|first=Irving M.|last=Mintzer|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0-521-42091-4}}</ref> Both "global warming" and the more politically neutral "climate change" were listed by the [[Global Language Monitor]] as political buzzwords or [[catchphrase]]s in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/?page_id=27|title=The Top Politically inCorrect Words for 2006|publisher=Global Language Monitor|accessdate=14 April 2007}}</ref>

In 2007 the BBC announced the cancellation of a planned television special [[Planet Relief]], which would have highlighted the global warming issue and included a mass electrical switch-off.<ref>{{cite web|last=Black|first=Richard|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6979596.stm|title=BBC switches off climate special|publisher=BBC|date=5 September 2007|accessdate=15 December 2011}}</ref> The editor of BBC's [[Newsnight]] current affairs show said: "It is absolutely not the BBC's job to save the planet.

The authors of the 2010 book ''[[Merchants of Doubt]]'' accuse climate change "skeptics" of trying to sow seeds of doubt in public opinion in order to halt any meaningful social or political progress to reduce the impact of human carbon emissions. The fact that only half of the American population believe that global warming is caused by human activity could be seen as a victory for these so-called skeptics.<ref name="merchants_doubt"/> One of the authors' main arguments is that most prominent scientists who have been voicing opposition to the near-universal consensus are being funded by industries, such as automotive and oil, that stand to lose money by government actions to regulate [[greenhouse gas]]es.

* There is widespread recognition that the climate, irrespective of the cause, is changing<U+2014>88% believe this to be true.
* However, the public is out of step with the scientific community, with 41% believing that climate change is being caused by both human activity and natural processes. 46% believe human activity is the main cause.
* Only a small minority reject anthropogenic climate change, while almost half (44%) are very concerned. However, there remains a large proportion who are yet to be fully persuaded and hold doubts about the extent of the threat.
* There is still a strong appetite among the public for more information, and 63% say they need this to come to a firm view on the issue and what it means for them.
* The public continue to externalize climate change to other people, places and times. It is increasingly perceived as a major global issue with far-reaching consequences for future generations<U+2014>45% say it is the most serious threat facing the World today and 53% believe it will impact significantly on future generations. However, the issue features less prominently nationally and locally, indeed only 9% believe climate change will have a significant impact upon them personally.

The [[Canada|Canadian]] science [[Presenter|broadcaster]] and [[environmentalism|environmental]] activist, [[David Suzuki]], reports that focus groups organized by the [[David Suzuki Foundation]] showed the public has a poor understanding of the science behind global warming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidsuzuki.org/about_us/Dr_David_Suzuki/Article_Archives/weekly08180601.asp|title=Public doesn't understand global warming|author=[[David Suzuki]]|publisher=David Suzuki Foundation|date=18 August 2006|accessdate=18 August 2007}}</ref> This is despite publicity through different means, including the films ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' and [[The 11th Hour (film)|''The 11th Hour'']].

An example of the poor understanding is public confusion between global warming and [[ozone depletion]] or other environmental problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piercelaw.edu/risk/vol8/fall/bord+.htm|title=Is Accurate Understanding of Global Warming Necessary to Promote Willingness to Sacrifice?|author=Richard J.

A 15-nation poll conducted in 2006 by [[Pew Research Center|Pew Global]] found that there "is a substantial gap in concern over global warming<U+2014>roughly two-thirds of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] (66%) and Indians (65%) say they personally worry a great deal about global warming.

Just 19% of Americans and 20% of the Chinese who have heard of the issue say they worry a lot about global warming<U+2014>the lowest percentages in the 15 countries surveyed.

There are differences between the opinion of scientists and that of the general public. A 2009 poll by [[Pew Research Center]] found that "[w]hile 84% of scientists say the earth is getting warmer because of human activity such as burning fossil fuels, just 49% of the public agrees".<ref name="PEW_2009A">[[Pew Research Center]]: "[http://people-press.org/report/528/ Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media]" 9 July 2009.</ref> A 2010 poll in the UK for the BBC showed "Climate scepticism on the rise".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8500443.stm|title=Climate scepticism 'on the rise', BBC poll shows|date=7 February 2010|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> [[Robert Watson (scientist)|Robert Watson]] found this "very disappointing" and said that "We need the public to understand that climate change is serious so they will change their habits and help us move towards a low carbon economy".

A 2012 Canadian poll found that 32% of Canadians said they believe climate change is happening because of human activity, while 54% said they believe it<U+2019>s because of human activity and partially due to natural climate variation. 9% believe climate change is occurring due to natural climate variation, and only 2% said they don't believe climate change is occurring at all.<ref>http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/only-2-per-cent-of-canadians-dont-believe-in-climate-change-poll/article4482183/</ref>

=== Related controversies ===

Many of the critics of the consensus view on global warming have disagreed, in whole or part, with the scientific consensus regarding other issues, particularly those relating to environmental risks, such as [[ozone depletion]], [[DDT#Environmental impact|DDT]], and [[passive smoking]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Environmental skepticism: ecology, power and public life|series=Global environmental governance series|author=Peter Jacques|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7546-7102-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=George E.

Mooney says that the promotion of doubt regarding issues that are politically, but not scientifically, controversial became increasingly prevalent under the Bush Administration, which, he says, regularly distorted and/or suppressed scientific research to further its own political aims. This is also the subject of a 2004 book by environmental lawyer [[Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]] entitled ''Crimes Against Nature: How George W. Bush and Corporate Pals are Plundering the Country and Hijacking Our Democracy'' (ISBN 978-0060746872).  Another book on this topic is ''[[The Assault on Reason]]'' by former U.S. Vice-President [[Al Gore]]. Earlier instances of this trend are also covered in the book ''The Heat Is On'' by [[Ross Gelbspan]].

Some critics of the scientific consensus on global warming have argued that these issues should not be linked and that reference to them constitutes an unjustified [[ad hominem]] attack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sepp.org/Archive/NewSEPP/How%20to%20think%20about%20GW.htm|title=NEW ON THE SEPP WEB|accessdate=23 May 2007}}</ref> Political scientist [[Roger A.

{{Main|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change}}

The "standard" view of climate change has come to be defined by the reports of the IPCC, which is supported by many other [[Scientific opinion on climate change|science academies and scientific organizations]]. In 2001, sixteen of the world's national science academies made a joint statement on climate change, and gave their support for the IPCC<ref name=royalsoc01>{{cite web

Some of the controversy and criticism has originated from experts invited by the IPCC to submit reports or serve on its panels.

[[Scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming]] express varied opinions concerning the cause of global warming. Some say only that it has not yet been ascertained whether humans are the primary cause of global warming; others attribute global warming to natural variation; [[ocean current]]s; increased [[solar variation|solar activity]] or cosmic rays. The consensus position is that solar radiation may have increased by 0.12 W/m<U+00B2> since 1750, compared to 1.6 W/m<U+00B2> for the net anthropogenic forcing.<ref name= "4ARSPM">

=== On the reliability of temperature records ===

Skeptics have questioned the accuracy of the [[instrumental temperature record]] on the basis of the [[urban heat island]] effect, the quality of the surface station network and what they view as unwarranted adjustments to the temperature record.

Weather stations that are used to compute global temperature records are not evenly distributed over the planet. There were a small number of weather stations in the 1850s, and the number didn't reach the current 3000+ until the 1951 to 1990 period <ref>http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/#faq {{full}}</ref>

Skeptics contend that stations located in more populated areas could show warming due to increased heat generated by cities, rather than a global temperature rise.<ref>{{cite web

Parker (2006) found that there was no difference in warming between calm and windy nights. Since the urban heat island effect is strongest for calm nights and is weak or absent on windy nights, this was taken as evidence that global temperature trends are not significantly contaminated by urban effects.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Parker|last=David|title=A demonstration that large-scale warming is not urban|journal=Journal of Climate|year=2006|volume=19|issue=12|pages=2882<U+2013>95|doi=10.1175/JCLI3730.1|url=http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&doi=10.1175%2FJCLI3730.1|bibcode = 2006JCli...19.2882P }}</ref> Pielke and Matsui published a paper disagreeing with Parker's conclusions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pielke Sr., R.A., and T.

==== Tropospheric temperature record ====

General circulation models and basic physical considerations predict that in the tropics the temperature of the [[troposphere]] should increase more rapidly than the temperature of the surface. A 2006 report to the [[U.S. Climate Change Science Program]] noted that models and observations agreed on this amplification for monthly and interannual time scales but not for decadal time scales in most observed data sets. Improved measurement and analysis techniques have reconciled this discrepancy: corrected buoy and [[List of climate research satellites|satellite]] surface temperatures are slightly cooler and corrected satellite and [[radiosonde]] measurements of the tropical troposphere are slightly warmer.<ref>

=== Infrared iris hypothesis ===

In 2001, [[Richard Lindzen]] proposed a system of compensating meteorological processes involving clouds that tend to stabilize climate change; he tagged this the "[[Iris hypothesis]], or "Infrared Iris."<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1175/1520-0477(2001)082<0417:DTEHAA>2.3.CO;2|author=Richard S.

[[Roy Spencer (scientist)|Roy Spencer]] ''et al''. suggested that "a net reduction in radiative input into the ocean-atmosphere system" in tropical intraseasonal oscillations  "may potentially support" the idea of an "Iris" effect, although they point out that their work is concerned with much shorter time scales.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Cloud and radiation budget changes associated with tropical intraseasonal oscillations |author=Spencer, Roy W., Braswell, William D., Christy, John R. & Hnilo, Justin |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=34|issue=15 |pages=L15707 |doi=10.1029/2007GL029698 |year=2007 |url=http://www.weatherquestions.com/Spencer_07GRL.pdf|format=PDF |bibcode=2007GeoRL..3415707S}}</ref> 

Other analyses have found that the iris effect is a ''positive'' feedback rather than the negative feedback proposed by Lindzen.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Journal of Climate |year=2002 |volume=15| issue=1 |pages=3<U+2013>7 |title=The iris hypothesis: a negative or positive cloud feedback? |author=Bing Lin, Bruce A.

<blockquote>[...] mixing up of cause and effect when observing natural climate variability can lead to the mistaken conclusion that the climate system is more sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions than it really is. [...] it provides a quantitative mechanism for the (minority) view that global warming is mostly a manifestation of natural internal climate variability.</blockquote>

<blockquote>[...] low frequency, internal radiative forcing amounting to little more than 1 W/m<sup>2</sup>, assumed to be proportional to a weighted average of the southern oscillation and Pacific decadal oscillation indices since 1900, produces ocean temperature behavior similar to that observed: warming from 1900 to 1940, then slight cooling through the 1970s, then resumed warming up to the present, as well as 70% of the observed centennial temperature trend.</blockquote>

=== Temperature predictions ===
Hansen's 1984 climate model predictions versus observed temperatures <ref>http://www.columbia.edu/~mhs119/Temperature/T_moreFigs/PNAS_GTCh_Fig2.pdf {{full}}</ref> are updated each year by Dr Mikako Sato of Columbia University.

The IPCC climate model predictions versus observed temperatures up to 2010 are presented on the realclimate website.<ref>http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2011/01/2010-updates-to-model-data-comparisons/ {{full}}</ref>

Conventional predictions of future temperature rises depend on estimates of future GHG emissions (see [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios|SRES]]) and the [[climate sensitivity]]. Models referenced by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) predict that global temperatures are likely to increase by 1.1 to 6.4&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (2.0 to 11.5&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) between 1990 and 2100. Others have proposed that temperature increases may be higher than IPCC estimates. One theory is that the climate may reach a "[[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]]" where positive feedback effects lead to runaway global warming; such feedbacks include decreased reflection of solar radiation as sea ice melts, exposing darker seawater, and the potential release of large volumes of methane from thawing permafrost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0916-09.htm|title=Global Warming 'Past the Point of No Return'|author=Steve Connor|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=16 September 2005|accessdate=7 September 2007}}</ref> In 1959 Dr. Bert Bolin, in a speech to the National Academy of Sciences, predicted that by the year 2000 there would be a 25% increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere compared to the levels in 1859. The actual increase by 2000 was about 29%.<ref>Science News, 9 May 2009{{full}}</ref>

Some scientists, such as [[David Orrell]] or [[Henk Tennekes]], say that climate change cannot be accurately predicted. Orrell says that the range of future increase in temperature suggested by the IPCC rather represents a social consensus in the climate community, but adds that "we are having a dangerous effect on the climate".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.postpythagorean.com/FAQ.html|title=Frequently asked questions on Apollo's Arrow/The Future of Everything, by David Orrell|author=David Orrell  |accessdate=11 September 2007}}</ref>

A 2007 study by [[David Douglass]] and coworkers concluded that the 22 most commonly used [[global climate model]]s used by the IPCC were unable to accurately predict accelerated warming in the [[troposphere]] although they did match actual surface warming, concluding that "projections of future climate based on these models should be viewed with much caution". This result contrasts a similar study of 19 models which found that discrepancies between model predictions and actual temperature were likely due to measurement errors.<ref name="sciencedaily_1207">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071211101623.htm|title=New Study Increases Concerns About Climate Model Reliability|accessdate=4 April 2008 |date=20 December 2007 |publisher=Sciencedaily.com}}{{full}}</ref>

=== Forecasts confidence ===

The IPCC states it has increased confidence in forecasts coming from General Circulation Models or GCMs. Chapter 8 of AR4 reads:
<blockquote>''There is considerable confidence that climate models provide credible quantitative estimates of future climate change, particularly at continental scales and above. This confidence comes from the foundation of the models in accepted physical principles and from their ability to reproduce observed features of current climate and past climate changes. Confidence in model estimates is higher for some climate variables (e.g., temperature) than for others (e.g., precipitation). Over several decades of development, models have consistently provided a robust and unambiguous picture of significant climate warming in response to increasing greenhouse gases.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter8.pdf |title=Climate Models and Their Evaluation |format=PDF |accessdate=29 August 2010}}{{full}}</ref></blockquote>

Certain scientists, skeptics and otherwise, believe this confidence in the models<U+2019> ability to predict future climate is not earned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skeptic.com/the_magazine/featured_articles/v14n01_climate_of_belief.html|title=Skeptic: The Magazine: A Climate of Belief}}{{full}}</ref><ref>[http://climatesci.org/2008/04/23/comment-on-real-climates-post-on-the-relevance-of-the-sensitivity-of-initial-conditions-in-the-ipcc-models/ Climate Science: Roger Pielke Sr. Research Group News <U+00BB> Comment On Real Climate<U+2019>s Post On The Relevance Of The Sensitivity Of Initial Conditions In The IPCC Models] {{dead link|date=September 2010}}{{full}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itia.ntua.gr/getfile/864/2/documents/2008HSJClimPredictions.pdf|title=On the credibility of climate predictions|format=PDF|accessdate=29 December 2008}}{{full}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Warmaudit31%205.pdf | title = Global Warming: Forecasts by Scientists Versus Scientific Forecasts | author = Kesten C.

=== Data archiving and sharing ===
{{main|Hockey stick controversy}}
Scientific journals and funding agencies generally require authors of peer-reviewed research to provide information on [[Scientific data archiving|archives of data]] and share sufficient [[Data sharing|data and methods]] necessary for a scientific expert on the topic to reproduce the work.

In political controversy over the 1998 and 1999 [[Temperature record of the past 1000 years|historic temperature reconstructions]] widely publicised as the "hockey stick graphs", [[Michael E. Mann|Mann]], [[Raymond S. Bradley|Bradley]] and [[Malcolm K. Hughes|Hughes]] as authors of the studies were sent letters on 23 June 2005 from Rep. [[Joe Barton]], chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] and [[Ed Whitfield]], Chairman of the [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations|Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations]], demanding full records on the research.<ref name="CHE 505">{{cite web |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Congressman-Demands-Complete/121447/ |title=Congressman Demands Complete Records on Climate Research by 3 Scientists Who Support Theory of Global Warming <U+2014> Archives   |author=Richard Monastersky |date=1 July 2005 |publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |accessdate=4 March 2011}}</ref>

[[Sherwood Boehlert]], chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|House Science Committee]], told his fellow Republican Joe Barton it was a "misguided and illegitimate investigation" seemingly intended to "intimidate scientists rather than to learn from them, and to substitute congressional political review for scientific review." The [[United States National Academy of Sciences|U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) president [[Ralph J. Cicerone]] wrote to Barton proposing that the NAS should appoint an independent panel to investigate.

On 15 July, Mann wrote giving his detailed response to Barton and Whitfield. He emphasised that the full data and necessary methods information was already publicly available in full accordance with [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) requirements, so that other scientists had been able to reproduce their work. NSF policy was that computer codes "are considered the intellectual property of researchers and are not subject to disclosure", but notwithstanding these property rights, the program used to generate the original MBH98 temperature reconstructions had been made available at the Mann et al. public ftp site.

Climatologist [[Kevin E. Trenberth]] stated:

<blockquote>The [[Summary for policymakers|SPM]] was approved line by line by governments[...] .The argument here is that the scientists determine what can be said, but the governments determine how it can best be said. Negotiations occur over wording to ensure accuracy, balance, clarity of message, and relevance to understanding and policy. The IPCC process is dependent on the good will of the participants in producing a balanced assessment. However, in Shanghai, it appeared that there were attempts to blunt, and perhaps obfuscate, the messages in the report, most notably by Saudi Arabia. This led to very protracted debates over wording on even bland and what should be uncontroversial text... The most contentious paragraph in the IPCC (2001) SPM was the concluding one on attribution. After much debate, the following was carefully crafted: "In the light of new evidence, and taking into account the remaining uncertainties, most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse-gas concentrations".<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Journal of the Forum for Environmental Law, Science, Engineering, and Finance|year=2001|issue=8<U+2013>26|first=Kevin|last=Trenberth|authorlink=Kevin E.

As more evidence has become available over the existence of global warming debate has moved to further controversial issues, including:

# The social and environmental impacts
# The appropriate response to climate change
# Whether decisions require less uncertainty

The single largest issue is the importance of a few degrees rise in temperature:
<blockquote>Most people say, "A few degrees? So what? If I change my thermostat a few degrees, I'll live fine."&nbsp;... [The] point is that one or two degrees is about the experience that we have had in the last 10,000 years, the era of human civilization. There haven't been<U+2014>globally averaged, we're talking<U+2014>fluctuations of more than a degree or so. So we're actually getting into uncharted territory from the point of view of the relatively benign climate of the last 10,000 years, if we warm up more than a degree or two. ([[Stephen H. Schneider]]<ref>{{cite web|title=What's up with the weather: the debate: Stephen H. Schneider|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/warming/debate/schneider.html|publisher=[[PBS Nova]] & [[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]]|date=|accessdate=13 April 2007}}</ref>)</blockquote>

The other point that leads to major controversy<U+2014>because it could have significant economic impacts<U+2014>is whether action (usually, restrictions on the use of [[fossil fuel]]s to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions) should be taken now, or in the near future; and whether those restrictions would have any meaningful effect on global temperature.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Because of the economic ramifications of such restrictions, there are those, including the [[Cato Institute]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[think tank]], who feel strongly that the negative economic effects of emission controls outweigh the environmental benefits.<ref name="taylorspeech">{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/speeches/sp-jt011698.html|title=Global Warming, the Anatomy of a Debate: A speech by Jerry Taylor of the Cato Institute}}</ref> They state that even if global warming is caused solely by the burning of fossil fuels, restricting their use would have more damaging effects on the world economy than the increases in global temperature.<ref name="PBSpalmer" />

<blockquote>The linkage between coal, electricity, and economic growth in the United States is as clear as it can be. And it is required for the way we live, the way we work, for our economic success, and for our future. Coal-fired electricity generation.

Ultimately, however, a strictly economic argument for or against action on climate change is limited at best, failing to take into consideration other potential impacts of any change.

[[Council on Foreign Relations]] senior fellow [[Walter Russell Mead]] argues that the 2009 [[Copenhagen Summit]] failed because environmentalists have changed from "Bambi to Godzilla".  According to Mead, environmentalist used to represent the skeptical few who made valid arguments against big government programs which tried to impose simple but massive solutions on complex situations.  Environmentalists' more recent advocacy for big economic and social intervention against global warming, according to Mead, has made them, "the voice of the establishment, of the tenured, of the technocrats" and thus has lost them the support of a public which is increasingly skeptical of global warming.<ref>[[George Will|Will, George]], "[http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_15978060 When Bambi becomes Godzilla]", ''[[Denver Post]]'', 5 September 2010.</ref>

{{Main|Kyoto Protocol}}

The Kyoto protocol is the most prominent international agreement on climate change, and is also highly controversial. Some argue that it goes too far<ref>{{cite web|title=A Guide to Kyoto: Climate Change and What it Means to Canadians: Does the Kyoto treaty go far enough... or too far?|first=Ian|last=Darragh|publisher=[[International Institute for Sustainable Development]]|year=1998|url=http://www.iisd.org/pdf/kyotoprimer_en.pdf|accessdate=14 April 2007|format=PDF}}</ref> or not nearly far enough<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/kyoto_protocol/application/pdf/kpstats.pdf|publisher=UNFCCC|title=Kyoto protocol status|accessdate=7 November 2006|format=PDF}} ([[Niue]],The [[Cook Islands]], [[Nauru]] consider reductions "inadequate")</ref> in restricting emissions of greenhouse gases. Another area of controversy is the fact that China and India, the world's two most populous countries, both ratified the protocol but are not required to reduce or even limit the growth of carbon emissions under the present agreement even though when [[List of countries by greenhouse gas emissions per capita|listed by greenhouse gas emissions per capita]], they have rankings of 121st largest per capita emitter at 3.9 Tonnes of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}e]] and 162nd largest per capita emitter at 1.8 Tonnes of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}e]] respectively, compared with for example the US at position of the 14th largest per capita [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}e]] emitter at 22.9 Tonnes of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}e]].

Both sides of the controversy have argued that access to funding has played a role in the willingness of credentialed experts to speak out.

Documents obtained by [[Greenpeace]] under the US [[Freedom of Information Act]] show that the [[Koch Family Foundations|Charles G.

=== Debate over most effective response to warming ===
{{See also|List of scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming}}

In recent years some skeptics have changed their positions regarding global warming. [[Ronald Bailey]], author of ''Global Warming and Other Eco-Myths'' (published by the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] in 2002), stated in 2005, "Anyone still holding onto the idea that there is no global warming ought to hang it up".<ref>

"There are alternatives to its [the climate-change crusade's] insistence that the only appropriate policy response is steep and immediate emissions reductions.... a greenhouse-gas-emissions cap ultimately would constrain energy production. A sensible climate policy would emphasize building resilience into our capacity to adapt to climate changes.... we should consider strategies of adaptation to a changing climate.

In 2001 Richard Lindzen, asked whether it was necessary to try to reduce {{CO2}} emissions, said that responses needed to be prioritised. "You can't just say, 'No matter what the cost, and no matter how little the benefit, we'll do this'. If we truly believe in warming, then we've already decided we're going to adjust...The reason we adjust to things far better than Bangladesh is that we're richer.

The Bush administration also voiced support for an adaptation-only policy. "In a stark shift for the Bush administration, the United States has sent a climate report [''U.S. Climate Action Report 2002''] to the United Nations detailing specific and far-reaching effects it says global warming will inflict on the American environment. In the report, the administration also for the first time places most of the blame for recent global warming on human actions<U+2014>mainly the burning of fossil fuels that send heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere". The report however "does not propose any major shift in the administration's policy on greenhouse gases. Instead it recommends adapting to inevitable changes instead of making rapid and drastic reductions in greenhouse gases to limit warming".<ref>

Far from proposing solutions to the climate change problem, the Administration has been adopting energy policies that would actually increase greenhouse gas emissions. Notably, even as the Report identifies increased air conditioner use as one of the 'solutions' to climate change impacts, the Department of Energy has decided to roll back energy efficiency standards for air conditioners.<ref>

Some find this shift and attitude disingenuous and indicative of an inherent bias against prevention (i.e. reducing emissions/consumption) and for the prolonging of profits to the oil industry at the expense of the environment. "Now that the dismissal of climate change is no longer fashionable, the professional deniers are trying another means of stopping us from taking action. It would be cheaper, they say, to wait for the impacts of climate change and then adapt to them" says writer and environmental activist George Monbiot<ref>

=== Political pressure on scientists ===

Many climate scientists state that they are put under enormous pressure to distort or hide any scientific results which suggest that human activity is to blame for global warming. A survey of climate scientists which was reported to the US House Oversight and Government Reform Committee noted that "Nearly half of all respondents perceived or personally experienced pressure to eliminate the words 'climate change', 'global warming' or other similar terms from a variety of communications". These scientists were pressured to tailor their reports on global warming to fit the Bush administration's climate change scepticism. In some cases, this occurred at the request of former oil-industry lobbyist Phil Cooney, who worked for the American Petroleum Institute before becoming chief of staff at the White House Council on Environmental Quality (he resigned in 2005 before being hired by ExxonMobil).<ref>[http://environment.newscientist.com/article/dn11074 US climate scientists pressured on climate change], NewScientist, 31 January 2007</ref> In June 2008, a report by NASA's Office of the Inspector General concluded that NASA staff appointed by the White House had censored and suppressed scientific data on global warming in order to protect the Bush administration from controversy close to the 2004 presidential election.<ref>{{cite news |last=Goddard |first=Jacqui |url=http://news.scotsman.com/world/Nasa-39played-down39-global-.4147975.jp |title=Nasa 'played down' global warming to protect Bush|newspaper=The Scotsman |location=Edinburgh |accessdate=12 February 2010 |date=4 June 2008 <!-- http://www.webcitation.org/5nU8o9ZoY --> }}</ref>

U.S. officials, such as [[Philip Cooney]], have repeatedly edited scientific reports from US government scientists,<ref>Campbell, D.

Climate scientist [[James E. Hansen]], director of NASA's [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]], wrote in a widely cited ''New York Times'' article<ref>{{cite news|first=Andrew C.|last=Revkin|title=Climate Expert Says NASA Tried to Silence Him|publisher=New York Times|date=29 January 2006|accessdate=14 April 2007|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/science/earth/29climate.html?ei=5088&en=28e236da0977ee7f&ex=1296190800&pagewanted=all}}</ref>
in 2006 that his superiors at the agency were trying to "censor" information "going out to the public". [[NASA]] denied this, saying that it was merely requiring that scientists make a distinction between personal, and official government, views in interviews conducted as part of work done at the agency. Several scientists working at the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] have made similar complaints;<ref>Eilperin, J. (6 April 2006) [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/05/AR2006040502150_pf.html "Climate Researchers Feeling Heat From White House"] ''Washington Post''</ref> once again, government officials said they were enforcing long-standing policies requiring government scientists to clearly identify personal opinions as such when participating in public interviews and forums.

The [[BBC]]'s long-running current affairs series ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' recently investigated the issue, and was told that "scientific reports about global warming have been systematically changed and suppressed".<ref>{{cite news|title=Climate chaos: Bush's climate of fear|publisher=BBC Panorama|date=1 June 2006|accessdate=14 April 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/5005994.stm}}</ref>

On the other hand, some American climatologists who have expressed doubts regarding the certainty of human influence in climate change have been criticized by politicians and governmental agencies. Oregon Governor [[Ted Kulongoski]] publicly clarified that Oregon does not officially appoint a "state climatologist" in response to Oregon State University's George Taylor's use of that title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hinessight.blogs.com/hinessight/2007/02/facts_about_geo.html |title=HinesSight: Facts about George Taylor and the "state climatologist" |publisher=Hinessight.blogs.com |date=8 February 2007 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=July 2010}}<ref>[http://www.kgw.com/news-local/stories/kgw_020607_news_taylor_title.59f5d04a.html Local News|kgw.com|News for Oregon and SW Washington]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> 

Scientists who agree with the consensus view have sometimes expressed concerns over what they view as sensationalism of global warming by interest groups and the press. For example [[Mike Hulme]], director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Research, wrote how increasing use of pejorative terms like "catastrophic", "chaotic" and "irreversible", had altered the public discourse around climate change: "This discourse is now characterised by phrases such as 'climate change is worse than we thought', that we are approaching 'irreversible tipping in the Earth's climate', and that we are 'at the point of no return'. I have found myself increasingly chastised by climate change campaigners when my public statements and lectures on climate change have not satisfied their thirst for environmental drama and exaggerated rhetoric".<ref>{{cite news|title=Chaotic world of climate truth|first=Mike|last=Hulme|publisher=BBC News|date=4 November 2006|accessdate=14 April 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6115644.stm}}</ref>

According to an Associated Press release on 30 January 2007,

<blockquote>Climate scientists at seven government agencies say they have been subjected to political pressure aimed at downplaying the threat of global warming.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The groups presented a survey that shows two in five of the 279 climate scientists who responded to a questionnaire complained that some of their scientific papers had been edited in a way that changed their meaning. Nearly half of the 279 said in response to another question that at some point they had been told to delete reference to "global warming" or "climate change" from a report".<ref>{{cite news|title=Groups Say Scientists Pressured On Warming|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] and [[Associated Press]]|date=30 January 2007|accessdate=14 April 2007|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/30/politics/main2413400.shtml}}</ref></blockquote>

In addition to the pressure from politicians, many prominent scientists working on climate change issues have reported increasingly severe harassment from members of the public. The harassment has taken several forms. The US [[FBI]] told ''[[ABC News]]'' that it was looking into a spike in threatening emails sent to climate scientists, while a white supremacist website posted pictures of several climate scientists with the word "Jew" next to each image. One climate scientist interviewed by ''ABC News'' had a dead animal dumped on his doorstep and now frequently has to travel with bodyguards.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC World News Sunday|publisher=ABC News|date=23 May 2010}}</ref>

Exxon Mobil is also notorious for skewing scientific evidence through their private funding of scientific organizations. In 2002, Exxon Mobil contributed $10,000 to The Independent Institute and then $10,000 more in 2003. In 2003, The Independent Institute release a study that reported the evidence for imminent global warming found during the Clinton administration was based on now-dated satellite findings and wrote off the evidence and findings as a product of "bad science."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reddy|first=Sudhakara|title=The Great Climate Debate.|journal=Energy Policy|year=2009|volume=37|issue=8}}</ref> 

This is not the only consortium of skeptics that Exxon Mobil has supported financially. The George C. Marshall Institute received $630,000 in funding for climate change research from ExxonMobil between 1998 and 2005. Exxon Mobil also gave $472,000 in funding to The Board of Academic and Scientific Advisors for the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow from 1998 to 2005. Dr. Frederick Seitz, well known as "the god father of global warming skepticism," served as both Chairman Emeritus of The George C. Marshall Institute and a board member of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow from 1998 to 2005.<ref>{{cite web|last=de Granados|first=Oriana Zill|title=The Doubters of Global Warming|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/hotpolitics/reports/skeptics.html|publisher=PBS}}</ref>

=== Litigation ===

Several lawsuits have been filed over global warming. For example, [[Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency]] before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] allowed the [[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] to [[Regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act|regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act]].  A similar approach was taken by California Attorney General [[Bill Lockyer]] who filed a lawsuit [[California v. General Motors Corp.]] to force car manufacturers to reduce vehicles' emissions of carbon dioxide. This lawsuit was found to lack legal merit and was tossed out.<ref>[http://www.fresnobee.com/columnists/walters/story/142464.html ]{{Dead link|date=December 2008}}{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}</ref> A third case, [[Comer v.
