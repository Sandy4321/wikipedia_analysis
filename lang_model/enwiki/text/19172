''Desfado'' was met with generally positive reviews by music critics. Robin Denselow wrote for ''[[The Guardian]]'' that Moura performed in the album "exquisite as ever", but he considered the decision of using additional instruments to her [[fado]] [[Trio (music)|trio]] as a mistake. Denselow noted an exception with the song "Dream of Fire", where American pianist [[Herbie Hancock]] is featured, and Denselow thought his contribution was "fine".<ref name=guardian>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/04/ana-moura-desfado-review|date=4 April 2013|accessdate=8 February 2014|title=Ana Moura: Desfado <U+2013> review|first=Robin|last=Denselow|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]}}</ref> In her review for [[PopMatters]], Deanne Sole prasied Moura's voice saying it makes the album "good, [because of her] strong unwavering contralto, excellent on the sad-hopeful tone".<ref name=popmatters>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/170070-ana-moura-desfado/|title=Ana Moura: Desfado|date=12 April 2013|accessdate=8 February 2014|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|first=Deanne|last=Sole}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer, Nate Chinen, suggested ''Desfado'' to be "renovator" and wrote it presents Moura's "ambitions even if she had stuck to [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]".<ref name=nyt>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/26/arts/music/albums-from-atoms-for-peace-ana-moura-and-antonio-sanchez.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|title=Albums From Atoms for Peace, Ana Moura and Antonio Sanchez|date=25 February 2013|first=Nate|last=Chinen|accessdate=8 February 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref> While Mariano Prunes asserted to say Moura combines "tradition with modernity",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.htzfm.com/Music/Album.aspx?id=2718377|title=Ana Moura <U+2013> Desfado Album Review|first=Mariano|last=Prunes|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] (archived through [[List of assets owned by Bell Media|97.7 HTZ-FM]], owned by [[Bell Media]])|language=Spanish|accessdate=8 February 2014}}</ref> George W.
