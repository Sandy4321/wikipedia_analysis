{{Merge|Miroku (InuYasha)|date=May 2008}}
'''Mushin''' is a character in the [[manga]] and [[anime]] series [[InuYasha]]. He is an elderly Buddhist monk and a slightly fat man (h<U+014D>shi; <U+6CD5><U+5E2B>, <U+307B><U+3046><U+3057>) who became Miroku's guardian when the Kazaana (Wind Tunnel) consumed Miroku's father.

Mushin has a moderate level of supernatural powers; he is able to periodically repair the Kazaana if it becomes enlarged when something nicks it on the way through. He trained Miroku as a Buddhist monk and raised him as his own son. Mushin is overly fond of [[sake]] and is not above "making the most" of a situation. He maintains a secluded Buddhist temple which is also the site of the Wind Tunnel crater, where Miroku's father and grandfather died.
