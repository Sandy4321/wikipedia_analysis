===''Albertine''===
{{Main|Albertine (album)}}
In 2005, prior to writing and preparing her follow-up album, Fraser/Ligertwood took a trip to [[Africa]] to immerse herself in Rwanda before visiting her sponsor children in Tanzania, as she is an advocate for child sponsorship. In this trip, she was so moved that she wrote the song "Albertine" about a young child (named Albertine), whom she met while in Rwanda. It was later decided to make this song the album's title track.<ref>http://www.brookefraser.com/</ref>

For the second album, Fraser decided to enlist a new band, primarily constructed from [[United States|American]] musicians who'd worked with an array of notable artists, both live and recorded.<ref name=brookesband>[http://www.brookefraser.com/newsTours/home.do?newsId=20030829003408 The NewsTours Page] on Fraser's website indicates her band's history.</ref> In 2006, Fraser and the band went into the studio in [[Los Angeles]] to record the album. Later, Fraser also allowed her MySpace page to give visitors a listen to the album's first single "[[Deciphering Me]]", which was later released initially to radio and ultimately to CD single, and achieved number four in the [[RIANZ|New Zealand single charts]].

On 4 December 2006 ''[[Albertine (album)|Albertine]]'' was released in New Zealand, achieving double platinum status less than a month after its release and has remained, to date,  in the top 20 every week since. The album was released in Australia and internationally on 31 March 2007. In Australia, it charted at number twenty-nine in its first week on 9 April and has thus far achieved Gold sales status in Australia.

On 6 April 2007, Fraser performed "Deciphering Me" for the [[Good Friday Appeal]], an annual televised fundraising event to raise money for the [[Royal Children's Hospital]] in [[Melbourne]].

In 2008, Fraser appeared on the [[Dave Barnes]] song "Believe" from his album ''[[Me + You + the World]]'', performing backing vocals.

''Albertine'' was also Fraser's U.S. debut, released 27 May 2008 and entered the [[Billboard 200]] at number ninety on 19 July 2008. Her album propelled in success with online sales after being chosen as Editor's Choice on [[iTunes]]. On July 4, 2008 Fraser supported Canadian artist/U2 collaborator Daniel Lanois at the Montreal Jazz Festival.  In August she toured the southern U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=264&objectid=10522552|title=Brooke Fraser puts a Kiwi note into US charts|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=21 July 2008|accessdate=20 August 2008}}</ref> In September, she re-toured several major U.S. cities and completed the tour at the Shepherd's Bush Empire in London, UK.

===''Flags''===
Her third album, "Flags" was released on 12 October 2010.<ref>http://brookefraser.com/</ref> The making of the album is documented in a series of videos that can be found on her [http://www.brookefraser.com/ website].

==Personal life==
After the success of her first album, Fraser moved to [[Sydney]], where she has lived since 2004. She commutes to the U.S. for touring. On March 17, 2008 she married Scott Ligertwood, in Sydney, changing her name to Brooke Ligertwood.<ref>News of marriage in [http://www.nzgirl.co.nz/articles/9271 NZ Girl]</ref> "Brooke Fraser" has remained her stage name for her activity as a [[Sony BMG]] recording/touring artist.  She continues to contribute to writing songs for [[Hillsong Church]], now as "Brooke Ligertwood".  Among her notable worship songs are "Desert Song" and "Hosanna". Despite the Christian character of much of her music, she has been quite vocal of her discontent with the commercialized nature of some of the [[Contemporary Christian Music]] industry, wishing to disassociate herself with those simply making profit from the sacred nature of Christian music.<ref>http://www.aboutchristianmusic.com.au/brooke_fraser_interview.html</ref>

==Charity work==
Fraser has been a [[World Vision]] Artist Associate since 2001. She has visited [[Cambodia]] and [[Tanzania]] with World Vision, the [[Philippines]] with [[Opportunity International]] and independently traveled to [[Rwanda]] in June 2005, in June 2006 as part of charity event "Hope Rwanda", and in May 2007 when she filmed the music video for the song "Albertine". In 2006 she, along with [[Petra Bagust]] and Tau from [[Spacifix]], appeared advertising the [[40 Hour Famine|World Vision 40 Hour Famine]]; an event which raises funds for children in [[third world country|third world countries]].  She also sponsors a number of children through World Vision{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} and makes child sponsorship available to people at her shows in NZ, Australia and the U.S., in addition to providing her audiences with other ways of contributing to the work of World Vision (i.e. fundraising t-shirts etc.).
