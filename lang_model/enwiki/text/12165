The '''Grand Duchy of [[Lithuania]]''' was a European state from the 12th<ref name="Baranauskas"/> /13th century until 1569 and then as a constituent part of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] until 1791 when [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]] abolished it in favor of unitary state.

The pagan state was targeted in the [[Northern Crusade|religious crusade]] by the [[Teutonic Knights]] and the [[Livonian Order]].

The reign of [[Vytautas the Great]] marked both the greatest territorial expansion of the Grand Duchy and defeat of the Teutonic Knights in the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410. It also marked the rise of the [[Lithuanian nobility]].

=== Establishment of the state ===
{{Main|History of Lithuania (1219<U+2013>1295)}}
[[File:Baltic Tribes c 1200.svg|thumb|250px|[[Balts]] in the 12th century]]
The [[name of Lithuania|first written reference to Lithuania]] is found in the [[Quedlinburg Chronicle]], which dates from 1009.<ref>Encarta.[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555831_4/Lithuania.html Lithuania]. Accessed September 21, 2006. [http://www.webcitation.org/5kwqCLkjF Archived] 2009-10-31.</ref> In the 12th century, Slavic chronicles refer to Lithuania as one of the areas attacked by [[the Rus]]'. At first pagan Lithuanians paid [[tribute]] to [[Polotsk]], but soon grew in strength and organized their own small-scale raids. At some point between 1180 and 1183 the situation began to change, and the Lithuanians started to organize sustainable military raids on the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] provinces, raiding the [[Principality of Polotsk]] as well as [[Pskov]], and even threatening [[Novgorod]].<ref name="Lituanica"/> The sudden spark of military raids marked consolidation of the Lithuanian lands in [[Auk<U+0161>taitija]].<ref name=Baranauskas/>

The [[Livonian Order]] and [[Teutonic Knights]], crusading [[military order]]s, were established in [[Riga]] in 1202 and in [[Prussia]] in 1226. The Christian orders posed a significant threat to pagan Baltic tribes and further galvanized the formation of the state. The peace treaty with [[Galicia<U+2013>Volhynia]] of 1219 provides evidence of cooperation between Lithuanians and [[Samogitia]]ns. This treaty lists [[List of early Lithuanian dukes|21 Lithuanian dukes]], including five senior Lithuanian dukes from [[Auk<U+0161>taitija]] ([[<U+017D>ivinbudas]], [[Daujotas]], [[Vilikaila]], [[Dausprungas]] and [[Mindaugas]]) and several dukes from [[Samogitia]]. Although they had battled in the past, the Lithuanians and the Samogitians now faced a common enemy.<ref>Lithuania Ascending p.50</ref> Likely <U+017D>ivinbudas had most authority<ref name=Lituanica/> and at least several dukes were from the same families.<ref>A.Bumblauskas. Senosios Lietuvos istorija, 1009<U+2013>1795 (The Early History of Lithuania).Vilnius, 2005, p.33</ref> The formal acknowledgment of common interests and the establishment of a hierarchy among the signatories of the treaty foreshadowed the emergence of the state.

===Kingdom of Lithuania===

[[File:Novogrudok ruin.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ruins of [[Navahrudak Castle]]. Current state.]]
Mindaugas, duke<ref>By contemporary accounts, the Lithuanians called their early rulers  ''kunigas'' (''kunigai'' in plural). The word was borrowed from the [[German language]] <U+2013> ''kuning'', ''konig''. Later on ''kunigas'' was replaced by the word ''kunigaik<U+0161>tis'', used to describe to medieval Lithuanian rulers in modern Lithuanian, while ''kunigas'' today means ''priest''.</ref> of southern Lithuania,<ref name="Kiaupos"/> was among the five senior dukes, mentioned in the treaty with Galicia<U+2013>Volhynia. According to the [[Livonian Rhymed Chronicle]], by mid-1230s Mindaugas acquired supreme power in the whole of Lithuania.<ref name="LV"/> In 1236, the [[Samogitia]]ns, led by [[Vykintas]], defeated the [[Livonian Order]] in the [[Battle of Saule]]. The Order was forced to become a branch of the [[Teutonic Knights]] in Prussia. That meant that Samogitia, a strip of land that separated Livonia from Prussia, became the main target of both orders. The battle provided a break in the wars with the Knights and Lithuania exploited this situation, arranging attacks towards the Ruthenian provinces and annexing [[Navahrudak]] and [[Hrodna]].<ref name=LV/>

In 1248 a civil war broke out between Mindaugas and his nephews [[Tautvilas]] and [[Edivydas]]. The powerful coalition against Mindaugas included Vykintas, the Livonian Order, [[Daniel of Galicia]], and [[Vasilko of Volhynia]]. Mindaugas, taking advantage of internal conflicts, allied with the Livonian Order. He promised to convert to Christianity and gift some lands in western Lithuania in exchange for military assistance against his nephews and the royal crown. In 1251 Mindaugas was baptized and [[Pope Innocent IV]] issued a [[papal bull]], proclaiming the creation of the [[Kingdom of Lithuania]]. After the civil war ended, Mindaugas was crowned as [[King of Lithuania]] on July 6, 1253, starting a decade of relative peace. Mindaugas tried to expand his influence in [[Polatsk]], a major center of commerce in the [[Daugava]] River basin, and [[Pinsk]].<ref name=LV/> The Teutonic Knights used this period to strengthen its position in parts of [[Samogitia]] and [[Livonia]], but lost the [[Battle of Skuodas]] in 1259 and the [[Battle of Durbe]] in 1260. These losses encouraged conquered [[Semigallians]] and [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] to rebel against the Knights.

Encouraged by [[Treniota]], Mindaugas broke the peace with the Order, possibly relapsed into [[Lithuanian mythology|his old beliefs]], and allied with [[Alexander Nevsky]] of [[Novgorod]]. He hoped to unite all Baltic tribes under the Lithuanian leadership. As military campaigns were not successful, the relationships between Mindaugas and Treniota deteriorated. Treniota together with [[Daumantas of Pskov|Daumantas]] assassinated Mindaugas and his two sons, Ruklys and Rupeikis, in 1263.<ref name="SLI"/> The state lapsed into years of internal fights.

===Rise of the Gediminids===
[[File:Kaunas - Castle 01.jpg|thumb|left|The ruins of the [[Kaunas Castle]]]]
[[File:Trakai-Troki.jpg|thumb|left|[[Trakai Island Castle]]]]
From 1263 to 1269, Lithuania had three Grand Dukes <U+2013> [[Treniota]], [[Vai<U+0161>vilkas]], and [[Svarn]]. However, the state did not disintegrate and [[Traidenis]] came to power in 1269. He strengthened Lithuanian control in [[Black Ruthenia]] and fought with the Livonian Order, winning the [[Battle of Karuse]] in 1270 and the [[Battle of Aizkraukle]] in 1279. There is considerable uncertainty about the identities of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania between Traidenis' death in 1282 and [[Vytenis]]' assumption of power in 1295. During this time the Orders finalized their conquests. In 1274 the [[Great Prussian Rebellion]] ended, and the Teutonic Knights proceeded to conquer other Baltic tribes: the [[Nadruvians]] and [[Skalvians]] in 1274<U+2013>1277, and the [[Yotvingians]] in 1283; the Livonian Order completed its conquest of Semigalia, the last Baltic ally of Lithuania, in 1291.<ref name="kiaupa"/> The Orders could now turn their full attention to Lithuania. The "buffer zone" composed of other Baltic tribes had disappeared, and Grand Duchy of Lithuania was left to battle the Orders on its own.

[[Gediminids]] dynasty has ruled Grand Duchy of Lithuania for several centuries, and Vytenis was the first ruler from the dynasty.<ref>Lithuania Ascending p.55</ref> His reign saw constant warfare with the Order, the Kingdom of Poland, and Ruthenia. Vytenis was involved in succession disputes in Poland, supporting [[Boleslaus II of Masovia]], who was married to a Lithuanian duchess [[Gaudemunda of Lithuania|Gaudemunda]]. In Ruthenia, Vytenis managed to recapture lands lost after the assassination of Mindaugas and capture the principalities of [[Pinsk]] and [[Tura<U+016D>]]. In the struggle against the Order, Vytenis allied with citizens of [[Riga]]. Securing positions in Riga strengthened trade routes and provided a base for further military campaigns towards. Around 1307, Polotsk, an important trading center, was annexed by military force.<ref>New Cambridge p.706</ref> Vytenis also began the construction of defensive castle network along the [[Neman River]]. Gradually this network developed into the main defensive line against the Teutonic Order.

===Territorial expansion===
{{History of Belarus}}
[[File:Gediminas Tower in Vilnius (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Gediminas Tower]] in Vilnius]]
[[File:MirCastle1.JPG|thumb|left|[[Mir Castle Complex|Mir Castle]]]]
The expansion reached its heights under [[Gediminas]], who created a strong central government and established an empire, which later spread from the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Baltic Sea]]. In 1320, most of the principalities of Western Rus' were either vassaled or annexed by Lithuania. In 1321 Gediminas [[Battle on the Irpen' River|captured Kiev]] sending [[Stanislav of Kiev|Stanislav]], the last [[Rurikid]] to ever rule [[Kiev]], into exile. Gediminas also re-established the permanent capital of Grand Duchy of Lithuania in [[Vilnius]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}, which was presumably moved from [[Old Trakai|Trakai]] in 1323. Some researches, including 16th century [[Maciej Stryjkowski]]<ref name="Stryjkowski"/> claim that [[Navahrudak]] was the capital of the 13th century state.

Lithuania was in an ideal position to inherit the western and the southern parts of [[Kievan Rus']]. While almost every other state around it had been [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|plundered or defeated by the Mongols]], their hordes stopped at the modern borders of Belarus and most of the territory of Grand Duchy of Lithuania was left untouched.<!-- Ukrainian lands were in GLD and Mongols moved far in it --> The expansion of Lithuania was also accelerated because of the weak control the Mongols had over the areas they had conquered. Rus' principalities were never incorporated directly into the [[Golden Horde]]. Instead, they were always vassal states with a fair degree of independence. The rise of Lithuania occurred at the ideal time when they could expand while meeting very little resistance in the territories populated by East Slavs and only limited opposition from the Mongols. At the [[Battle at Blue Waters (1362)]] regiments of the United army of Grand Duchy successfully defeated the army of the [[Golden Horde]].<ref>[http://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/2011/12/30/66894/ Battle at Blue Waters (Ukrainian Pravda)]</ref> The battle took place almost 20 years before the infamous [[Battle at Kulikovo Field]].

But Grand Duchy of Lithuania was not built only on military aggression, as its existence always{{When|date=August 2010}} depended on diplomacy just as much as on arms.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Most, while not all, cities it annexed were never defeated in battle but agreed to be vassals of Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Since most of them were already vassals of the Golden Horde or of the [[Grand Prince of Moscow]], such a decision was not one of giving up independence but rather of exchanging one master for another. This can be seen in the case of [[Novgorod]], which was often brought into the Lithuanian sphere of influence and became an occasional dependency of Grand Duchy of Lithuania.<ref>Glenn Hinson. The Church Triumphant: A History of Christianity Up to 1300. 1995, p.438</ref>  Rather, Lithuanian control was the result of internal frictions within the city, which attempted to escape submission to [[Muscovy]]. This method of building the state was, however, unstable. The change of internal politics within a city could pull it out of Lithuania's control, as happened on a number of occasions with Novgorod and other East-Slavic cities.

===Union with Poland===

[[File:Chrzest Litwy 1387 Matejko.JPG|thumb|left|"[[Christianization of Lithuania#Christianization by Jogaila and Vytautas|Christianization of Lithuania]] in 1387", oil on canvas by [[Jan Matejko]], 1889, [[Royal Castle in Warsaw]]]]
Lithuania was Christianized in 1387. Christianization was led by Jogaila, who personally translated Christian prayers into the [[Lithuanian language]].<ref>Jerzy Kloczowski. ''A History of Polish Christianity''. Cambridge University Press, 2000. p.55</ref> The state reached a peak under [[Vytautas the Great]], who reigned from 1392 to 1430. Vytautas was one of the most famous rulers of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He was the [[Grand Duke]] from 1401<U+2013>1430, also the [[Prince]] of [[Hrodna]] (1370<U+2013>1382) and the Prince of [[Lutsk]] (1387<U+2013>1389). Vytautas was the son of [[K<U+0119>stutis]], cousin of [[Jogaila]], who became King of Poland in 1386, and grandfather of [[Vasili II of Moscow]]. In 1410, Vytautas himself commanded the forces of the Grand Duchy in the [[Battle of Grunwald]]. The battle ended in a decisive Polish-Lithuanian victory against the [[Teutonic Order]]. Vytautas backed economic development of his state and introduced many reforms. Under his rule, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania slowly became more centralized, as the governors loyal to Vytautas replaced local princes with dynastic ties to the throne. The governors were rich landowners who formed the basis for the nobility of Grand Duchy of Lithuania. During Vytautas' rule, the [[Radziwi<U+0142><U+0142>]] and [[Go<U+0161>tautas]] families started to gain influence.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The speedy expansion of [[Muscovy]]'s influence soon put it into a position to rival Grand Duchy of Lithuania, however, and after the annexation of Novgorod in 1478, Muscovy was unquestionably{{By whom|date=August 2010}} the preeminent state in [[Northeastern Europe]].  Between 1492 and 1508, [[Ivan III]], after winning the key [[Battle of Vedrosha]], regained such ancient lands of [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]] as [[Chernigov]] and [[Bryansk]].

{{Main|Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth}}
The loss of land to Moscow and the continued pressure threatened the survival of the state of Lithuania, so it was forced to ally more closely with [[Poland]], uniting with its western neighbor as the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (''Commonwealth of Two Nations'') in the [[Union of Lublin]] of 1569. According to the Union many of the territories formerly controlled by the largely Ruthenized<ref name="EB1"/> Grand Duchy of Lithuania were transferred to the [[Crown of the Polish Kingdom]], while the gradual process of [[Polonization]] slowly drew Lithuania itself under Polish domination.<ref name=EB1/><ref name="EB2"/><ref name="EB3"/> The Grand Duchy retained many rights in the [[federation]] (including a separate government, treasury and army) until the [[May Constitution of Poland]] was passed in 1791.

=== Partitions and the Napoleonic period ===
Following the [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], most of the lands of the former Grand Duchy were directly annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] rather than attached to the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], a rump state in personal union with Russia. However, in 1812, soon before the [[French invasion of Russia]], the lands of the former Grand Duchy revolted against the Russians. Soon after his arrival to Vilnius, Napoleon proclaimed the creation of a [[Commissary Provisional Government of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], which in turn renewed the [[Polish-Lithuanian Union]].<ref name="Sobczy<U+0144>ski">{{pl icon}} {{cite journal |author=[[Marek Sobczy<U+0144>ski]] |title=Procesy integracyjne i dezintegracyjne na ziemiach litewskich w toku dziej<U+00F3>w |version= |publisher=Zak<U+0142>ad Geografii Politycznej [[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A> University|Uniwersytetu <U+0141><U+00F3>dzkiego]] |date= |url=http://www.geo.uni.lodz.pl/~zgpol/sob/ziemie_litewskie.pdf |format=pdf |id= |accessdate=2007-10-11 }}</ref> However, the union was never formalized as only half a year later Napoleon's ''[[Grande Arm<U+00E9>e]]'' was pushed out of Russia and forced to retreat further westwards. In December 1812, Vilnius was recaptured by Russian forces, bringing all plans of recreation of the Grand Duchy to an end.<ref name="Sobczy<U+0144>ski"/>

==Demographics==

In the mid and late 17th century, due to Russian and Swedish invasions, there was much devastation and population loss on throughout the Grand Duchy of Lithuania,<ref name="Kotilaine"/> including ethnic Lithuanian population in [[Vilnius voivodeship|Vilnius surroundings]]. Besides devastation, Ruthenian population declined proportionally after the territorial losses to [[Russian Empire]]. By 1770 there were about 4.84 million inhabitants in the territory of 320 thousand km<sup>2</sup>, the biggest part of whom were inhabitants of Ruthenia and about 1.39 million or 29% <U+2013> of ethnic Lithuania.<ref name="Letukiene"/> During the following decades, the population decreased in a result of [[Partitions of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|partitions]].<ref name="Letukiene"/>

==Languages==
In the 13th century, the [[Lithuania Proper|center of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], was inhabited by a majority which spoke Lithuanian,<ref name="Stone2"/> but it was not a written language till 16th century.<ref name="OConnor"/> At the other parts of the duchy, especially in the economically better developed Belarus{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, the majority of population, including [[Ruthenian nobility|Ruthenian nobles]] and normal people used both spoken and written [[Ruthenian language]]s.<ref name="Stone2"/> Nobles who migrated from one place to another would adapt to a new locality and adopt the local religion and culture and those [[Lithuanian nobility|Lithuanian noble families]] which moved to Slavic areas, took up the local culture quickly over subsequent generations.<ref name=burzub4/> Ruthenians were native to the center and south-eastern part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and since they were the major population in a wider area than a half of a whole after the Union of Lublin and in larger portions of a whole before the union, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was a Slavic country in this sense.

The [[Ruthenian language]] was used to write laws alongside Latin and German. From the time of Vytautas, there are fewer remaining documents written in Ruthenian than there are in Latin and German, but later Ruthenian became the main language of documentation and writings. In 16th century at the time of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Lithuanian lands became increasingly [[polonization|polonized]] over time and started to use the [[Polish language]] instead of [[Ruthenian language]] and was officially changed by [[Polish language|Polish]] as the chancellery language of the Lithuanian-Polish Commonwealth in 1697.<ref name=burzub4/><ref name="Zinkevi<U+010D>ius"/><ref name="Stone"/><ref name="wiemer109"/>

The voivodeships with the predominant ethnic Lithuanian population were [[Vilnius voivodeship|Vilnius]], [[Trakai voivodeship|Trakai]] and [[Eldership of Samogitia|Samogitian]] voivodeships. In the southern part of Trakai voivodeship, and south-eastern part of Vilnius voivodeship there were many Belarusians too, in some of the south-eastern volosts they were the major linguistic group. In addition to [[Lithuanians]] and [[Ruthenians]], other important ethnic groups on throughout the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were [[Lithuanian Jews|Jews]] and [[Lipka Tatars|Tatars]].<ref name=burzub4/> Vilnius city population and its surroundings were multi-ethnic, among languages spoken here, there were [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[German language|German]] also [[Tatar language|Tatar]], [[Crimean Karaites|Karaim]] etc.{{When|date=August 2010}}

===Languages used for State and Academic Purposes Within the Grand Duchy===
[[File:Tribunal-1586.png|thumb|Tribunal of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, written in [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]], 1586]]
Numerous languages were used in state documents depending on which period in history and for what purpose.  These languages included [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] ([[East Slavic languages|East Slavonic]]; [[Old Belarusian]] or [[Old Ukrainian]]),<ref name=wiemer109/><ref>Stone, Daniel. ''The Polish-Lithuanian State, 1386-1795.''

The statutes of the Grand Duchy were later translated into Latin and Polish as well.

The Court used Ruthenian to correspond with Eastern countries while Latin and German were used in foreign affairs with Western countries.<ref name=wiemer109/><ref>Kamuntavi<U+010D>ius, Rustis.

Although usage of the [[Lithuanian language]] at Court after the death of [[Vytautas]] and [[Jogaila]] is disputed{{By whom|date=August 2010}}, it is believed{{By whom|date=August 2010}} Grand Duke [[Alexander Jagiellon|Alexander I]] could understand and speak Lithuanian, and the last Grand Duke [[Zygmunt August]] maintained both Polish- and Lithuanian-speaking courts.<ref name="Stone3"/>

From the beginning of the 16th century, and especially after a rebellion led by [[Michael Glinski]] in 1508, there were attempts by the Court to replace the usage of Ruthenian with Latin.<ref name="Dubonis"/> But the Ruthenian tongue had deep cultural roots.  Its use by academics in areas formerly part of Rus' and even in Lithuania proper was widespread.

Nonetheless, [[Mikalojus Dauk<U+0161>a]], writing in Polish, noted in his Postilla (1599) that many people, especially [[szlachta]], preferred to speak Polish rather than Lithuanian, but spoke Polish poorly.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Such were the linguistic trends in the Grand Duchy that by the political reforms of 1564<U+2013>1566 [[sejmik|parliaments]] local land courts, appellate courts and other State functions were recorded in Polish.<ref name="Dubonis"/> and Polish became increasingly spoken across all social classes.

===Lithuanian language situation===
[[File:Lithuanian language in the 16th century.png|thumb|Area of the [[Lithuanian language]] in the 16th century]]
Lithuanian, Ruthenian and Polish languages were used as state languages of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Vilnius, Trakai and Samogitian  were the core voivodeships of the state{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}, as evidenced by the privileged position of their governors in state authorities, such as the [[Council of Lords]]. Peasants in ethnic Lithuanian territories spoke exclusively Lithuanian, except transitional border regions, but the [[Statutes of Lithuania]] and other laws and documentation were written in Ruthenian. Following the royal court, there was tendency to replace [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] with Polish in the ethnic Lithuanian areas, whereas Ruthenian was stronger in ethnic Belarusian and Ukrainian territories. There is [[Sigismund von Herberstein]]'s note left, that there were in an ocean of [[Old East Slavic|Russian language]] in this part of Europe two non Russian regions: Lithuania and Samogitia.<ref name="Dubonis"/>

Following the expansion of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the mid 14th century the adjective "Lithuanian", besides denoting an ethnic Lithuanian, from early times denoted any inhabitant of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, irrespective of ethnicity: a Ruthenian, a Jew, a Lithuanian{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. In the 18th century "Litvin" (Polish: Litwin, Russian: <U+041B><U+0438><U+0442><U+0432><U+0438><U+043D>) meant Polish, Belarusian and Lithuanian speakers. Since an adjective Lithuanian was applied after a name of a state, the understanding of it varied depending on place. For example, in eastern Ukraine, around [[Poltava]], "Litvin" was a person living in the other side of [[Desna River]], Belarusian speaker.<ref name="Zinkevi<U+010D>ius">{{lt icon}} [http://viduramziu.istorija.net/socium/zinkevicius1995.htm Lietuvos Did<U+017E>iosios kunigaik<U+0161>tyst<U+0117>s kanceliarin<U+0117>s slav<U+0173> kalbos termino nusakymo problema] Z. Zinkevi<U+010D>ius</ref>

At one point of the history of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, higher strata of Lithuanian society from ethnic Lithuania mostly spoke Polish, and from Belarus <U+2013> [[Old Belarusian language|Old Belarusian]]. [[Eldership of Samogitia|Samogitia]] was exclusive through state in its economical situation <U+2013> it lain near ports and there were less people under [[corvee]], instead of that, many simple people were money payers. As a result, the stratification of the society was not as sharp as in other areas. Being more similar to a simple population the local [[szlachta]] spoke Lithuanian to a bigger extent than in the areas close to the capital Vilnius, which itself had become a center of intensive linguistic Polonization.
The last sermons in Lithuanian in one of Vilnius churches were stopped to say in 1738. In schooling, Latin language was being changed to Polish and Lithuanian language repudiated. It was not let into [[Vilnius University]] in the late 18th century, parochial and powiat school learning for Lithuanian speaking children through Lithuania was organized in Polish by people having [[Commission of National Education|offices in Vilnius]]. In such circumstances "Samogitians" were known as szlachta, besides Polish using Lithuanian too, and the mass of "Lithuanians", that is any citizens on throughout the state, were understood as mostly Polish speaking szlachta living in Vilnius and its surrounding area and Polish-Belarusian speaking Belarusian szlachta.{{Dubious|date=May 2009}}<ref name=burzub4/>

There were{{When|date=August 2010}} texts written{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} in the local Lithuanian language of the Vilnius area, lying south-eastwards from Vilnius, then called Lithuanian language, today called a dialect of Eastern [[Auk<U+0161>taitian]], appearing at the end of the 17th century, the beginning of the 18th century, but it did not become used widerly as a written language and disappeared.  The main written language, not including Polish, used by Lithuanians as their own one, became a language, which was then called Samogitian language, today <U+2013> a dialect of western Auk<U+0161>taitian, and was spoken in the area starting about [[Nev<U+0117><U+017E>is River]] lowland westwards from Auk<U+0161>taitija.

==Military==
[[File:Grunwald bitwa.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Grunwald]]. Center figures are [[Ulrich von Jungingen]] and [[Vytautas]]]]
Despite Lithuania's mainly peaceful acquisition of much of its Ruthenian holdings it could call upon military strength if needed and it was the only power in [[Eastern Europe]] that could effectively contend with the Golden Horde. When the Golden Horde did try to prevent Lithuanian expansion they were often rebuffed. In 1333 and 1339 Lithuanians defeated large Mongol forces attempting to regain [[Smolensk]] from the Lithuanian sphere of influence. By about 1355, the State of [[Moldavia]] had formed. The Golden Horde did little to re-vassalize the area. In 1387, Moldavia became a vassal of Poland and in a broader sense, Lithuania. By this time, Lithuania had conquered territory of the Golden Horde all the way to the Dnieper River. In a crusade against the Golden Horde in 1398, (in an alliance with [[Tokhtamysh]]), Lithuania invaded northern Crimea and won a decisive victory. Then in 1399, Lithuania (intent on placing Tokhtamish on the Golden Horde throne) moved against the Horde. In the [[Battle of the Vorskla River]] however, Lithuania was crushed by the Horde and lost the steppe region.

After the baptism in 1252 and coronation of King [[Mindaugas]] in 1253, Lithuania was recognized as a Christian state until 1260, when Mindaugas supported an uprising in [[Courland]] and (according to the German order) renounced Christianity. Up until 1387, Lithuanian nobles professed their own religion, which was [[polytheistic]]. Ethnic Lithuanians were very dedicated to their faith. The pagan beliefs needed to be deeply entrenched to survive strong pressure from missionaries and foreign powers. Until the seventeenth century there were relics of old faith, like feeding [[<U+017E>altys]] or bringing food to graves of ancestors.

The lands of modern-day [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]], as well as local [[duke]]s (princes) in these regions, were firmly [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] Christian (Greek Catholic after the [[Union of Brest]]), though. While pagan beliefs in Lithuania were strong enough to survive centuries of pressure from military orders and missionaries, they did eventually succumb. In 1387, Lithuania converted to [[Catholicism]], while most of the Ruthenian lands stayed [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]. There was an effort to polarize Orthodoxes after the [[Union of Brest]] in 1596, by which Orthodox Greek Catholics acknowledged papal authority and Catholic catechism, but preserved Orthodox liturgy. Country also became one of the major centers of reformation.

<!-- Somebody should write about Renaissance and Lithuanians studying in Italy and the culture, science and education that flourished-->
In the second half of the 17h century Calvinism spread in Lithuania, supported by the families of [[Radziwi<U+0142><U+0142>]], [[Chodkiewicz]], [[Sapieha]], [[Dorohostajski]] and others. By 1580s the majority of the senators from Lithuania were [[Calvinist]] or even Arians ([[Jan Kiszka]]).

In 1579, [[Stephen B<U+00E1>thory|Stefan Batory]], King of [[Poland]] and Grand Duke of Lithuania, founded [[Vilnius University]], one of the oldest universities in [[Eastern Europe]]. Due to the work of the [[Jesuits]] during the [[Counter-Reformation]] the university soon developed into one of the most important scientific and cultural centers of the region and the most notable scientific center of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.<ref>Vilniaus Universitetas. [http://www.vu.lt/site_files/InfS/Leidiniai/Vilnius_University_1579_2004.pdf History of Vilnius University]. Retrieved on 2007.04.16</ref> The work of the Jesuits as well as conversions from among the Lithuanian senatorial families turned the tide and by 1670s [[Polish Reformed Church|Calvinism]] lost its former importance though it still retained some influence among the ethnically Lithuanian peasants and some middle nobility, by then thoroughly Polonized.

According to some historians{{Who|date=October 2008}} (especially in [[Russia]]), one of the most crucial effects of Lithuanian rule was ethnic divisions amongst the inhabitants of former [[Kievan Rus']]. From this point of view, the creation of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania played a major role in the division of [[Eastern Slavs]]. After the Mongolian conquest of [[Rus' people|Rus']], Mongols attempted to keep  Eastern Slavs unified and succeeded in conquering most of Ruthenian lands.

[[Prussians|Prussian tribes]] (of [[Balts|Baltic]] origin) were attacking [[Masovia]], and that was the reason Duke [[Konrad of Masovia]] invited the [[Teutonic Knights]] to settle near the Prussian area of settlement. The fighting between Prussians and the Teutonic Knights gave the more distant Lithuanian tribes time to unite. Because of strong enemies in the south and north, the newly formed Lithuanian state concentrated most of its military and diplomatic efforts on expansion eastward.

The rest of former Ruthenian lands ([[Belarus]]ian principalities) joined the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the very beginning. Some other lands in Ukraine were vassalized by Lithuania later. The subjugation of Eastern Slavs by two powers created substantial differences that persist to this day. According to this claim, while under Kievan Ruthenia there were certainly substantial regional differences, it was the Lithuanian annexation of much of southern and western Ruthenia that led to the permanent division between [[Ukraine|Ukrainians]], [[Belarus]]ians, and [[Russians]]. <!-- [[Kiev]] and other southern cities of Ruthenia had not enough resources to avoid annexation by [[Russia]] like Novgorod, a city which also had strong regional differences to [[Vladimir-Suzdal']], but ones that were erased by total Moscow regional domination. However, presence of a strong empire prevented quick reunification of the land of Ruthenia before the separate national identities formed.-->

Others{{Who|date=October 2008}} argue, that the ethnic and linguistic divisions amongst inhabitants of Ruthenia were not initiated by division of this area between [[Mongols]] and [[Lithuania]], and are older than the creation of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. They state that until the twentieth century, ethnic and linguistic frontiers between Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Russians coincided with no political borders.

<!-- Although after union with Poland and creation of Republic of two nations, Krown acquired Halych and Volyn, until the end of Rzeczpospolita of both nations in those both lands First statute of GDL remained in rule as a codecs of law. -->
Notwithstanding the above, Lithuania was a Kingdom under Mindaugas I, who was conditionally crowned by authority of Pope Innocent IV in 1253. Gediminas and Vytautas the Great also assumed the title of King, although uncrowned. A failed attempt was made in 1918 to restore the Kingdom under German [[Mindaugas II of Lithuania|Prince Urach]].
