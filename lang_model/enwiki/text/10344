'''Grade''' was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] group. Grade's first release was the Grade/Believe split which was released in 1994 on a small Canadian label - Workshop Records. ''[[And Such Is Progress]]'' followed in 1997 and ''[[Separate the Magnets]]'' was released in 1998, earning them critical praise and high profile touring slots with groups such as [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[Hot Water Music]] and [[Fugazi]]. In 1999, they signed with [[Victory Records]] and released an EP, ''[[Triumph and Tragedy]]''.  Later that same year they released a full length album, ''[[Under the Radar (Grade album)|Under the Radar]]''.  In 2000, they released ''[[The Embarrassing Beginning]]'', a collection of their older works, as well as rarities. In 2001, original guitarist Greg Taylor left to pursue [[Jersey (band)|Jersey]] full time, and was replaced with Brad Casarin. Chris Danner subsequently left, with [[Charlie Moniz]] joining for the release of the album ''[[Headfirst Straight to Hell]]''. In their final incarnation, only [[Kyle Bishop]] remained, backed by members of the group [[Somehow Hollow]].
The band broke up in 2002.
