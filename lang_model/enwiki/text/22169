'''Gerald Grinstein''' is the current [[CEO]] of [[Delta Air Lines]], Inc. of [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], the airline that currently carries the second most passengers in the World. Grinstein came to the position after CEO [[Leo F. Mullin]] stepped down.

Previously, Grinstein served as CEO of [[Western Airlines]].  When Western and Delta merged in [[1987]], he was appointed to  Delta's Board of Directors, and has served on the board ever since.  Under his leadership, Delta Air Lines has undergone many cost-cutting measures due to pressure from new, low cost rivals, yet in its transformation Delta ultimately filed for bankruptcy protection in 2005.

From [[1985]] to [[1995]] Mr. Grinstein was also CEO of [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] (BN).  In this position he helped form the corporate entity that resulted in BN's merger which formed the [[BNSF Railway]].

Grinstein has announced that he plans to retire from Delta around the same time the company exits bankruptcy protection.
