[[Image:Pasta Venice.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Some different colours and shapes of pasta, in a pasta specialty store in Venice.]]

While the only basic difference between these names is the shape of the [[pasta]], each pasta is typically matched with a particular sauce based on cooking time, consistency, ability to hold sauce, ease of eating, etc. In the same way that [[hamburgers]] are generally not eaten on [[hot dog]] buns, pasta [[Sugo all'amatriciana|amatriciana]], for example, is not made with angel hair spaghetti, but with [[bucatini]]. Some pasta varieties are uniquely regional and not diffused throughout Italy. In other cases, the cut of pasta is present in more than one region, but the cut is called by another name.   For example, the cut [[rotelle]] is also called by the names [[ruote]] and [[wagon wheel]].
