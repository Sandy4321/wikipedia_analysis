"'''Irreplaceable'''" is a song by [[United States|American]] singer-songwriter [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]]. The song was written by Knowles, [[Ne-Yo]], Tor Erik Hermansen, Mikkel S. Eriksen, [[Espen Lind]], Amund Bj<U+00F8>rklund, and was co-produced by [[Stargate (production team)|Stargate]] for Beyonc<U+00E9>'s second solo studio album, ''[[B'Day]]'' (2006). "Irreplaceable" was not intended for Beyonc<U+00E9> because the tune was not fitted to her voice and was written from a male's viewpoint. After hearing the [[demo (music)|demo]], Beyonc<U+00E9> made her vocal arrangements and alterations, hence credited for the record. The [[country music|country]]-turned-R&B-pop oriented song utilizes a gently-strummed [[acoustic guitar]]. "Irreplaceable" was part of Beyonc<U+00E9> and Ne-Yo's vision of creating a record that people could relate. The lyrics celebrate breaking up with an unfaithful man and hooking with new one, considered as a female empowerment anthem.

Following the relatively mediocre chart performance of "[[Ring the Alarm]]", "Irreplaceable" was released as the album's third [[single (music)|single]] late in 2006, and as the second single on several international markets, preceded with the album's lead single "[[D<U+00E9>j<U+00E0> Vu (Beyonc<U+00E9> song)|D<U+00E9>j<U+00E0> Vu]]". "Irreplaceable" was a worldwide commercial success, becoming Beyonc<U+00E9>'s best-charting single in her entire solo career and ''B'Day''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s most successful single. "Irreplaceable" performed well, peaking within the top ten on most of the charts it entered. In the United States, the single peaked at number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]]. It remained on the top spot for ten consecutive weeks, beating "[[Baby Boy (song)|Baby Boy]]"'s record held. The single was certified multi-platinum. "Irreplaceable" emerged as the most successful single of 2007 in the United States and eighteenth best-selling singles worldwide. The feat held by the song propelled Beyonc<U+00E9> at number three on the list of most number-one single by a female artist.

"Irreplaceable" was lauded by contemporary critics, citing for its use of guitar and distinct production compared to most tracks of the album. The song won awards, and was nominated at the 2008 [[Grammy Award]]s for the Record of the Year. The single's [[music video]] equally performed well on video programs, and features the debut performance of her all-female band Suga Mama. The music video earned Beyonc<U+00E9> additional awards.

"Irreplaceable" is about putting out a boyfriend after he cheats and says that he was foolish to think that she would not find someone if he leaves.

And sometimes you feel like you're not being, you know, appreciated. And, you know, sometimes they forget that they can be replaced. And it's important to have songs like that, to remind us.

The song is constructed in the verse-pre-chorus-chorus form. The guitar strums giving way to the hook-intro "To the left, to the left". Beyonc<U+00E9> sings the phrase three times in alternating [[bar (music)|bars]]. In bar seven, she sings the first verse, arguing her man with the mess in their relationship and tells him to walk away. The pre-chorus enters followed with the main chorus. In the second verse, she recollects the moment she knew her man is unfaithful to her. The same pattern occurs, reaching the second chorus. Towards the end, Beyonc<U+00E9> mouths the [[bridge (music)|bridge]]. She repeats the intro and the chorus, ending with an ad-libbed chorus.

The video follows a simple story where Beyonc<U+00E9>'s boyfriend is packing his belongings, ready to leave the house after she kicked him out.

She pretentiously caresses the guy; only to find out she would get the stuffs she owns including the necklace and sweater she bought for him. Her guy left her and the car, about to ride on a taxi. Between cuts, Beyonc<U+00E9> manages herself in front of a mirror, putting on a lipstick, wearing huge curlers and a high-waisted skirt. She is preparing herself to welcome his new man. Towards the end of the video, she sings with her band. The video ends with Beyonc<U+00E9> greeting her new boyfriend at the house's front door.
