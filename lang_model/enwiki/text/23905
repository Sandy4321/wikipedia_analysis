'''Pompeia Magna''' (born between [[80 BC]] and [[75 BC]] - before [[35 BC]]) was the only daughter and second child born to [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] triumverate [[Pompey]] the Great or Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus from his third marriage to [[Mucia Tertia]]. Her eldest brother is [[Gnaeus Pompeius]] and her younger brother is [[Sextus Pompeius]]. 

Pompeia was born and raised in Rome. In [[59 BC]], Pompey had married [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|Julia Caesaris]], the daughter of [[Julius Caesar]], as his fourth wife. Julia before marrying her father was betrothed to politician Quintus Servilius Caepio. After Pompey and Julia had married, Pompeia was betrothed to Quintus Servilius Caepio, but in the end she didn<U+2019>t marry Caepio, instead Pompeia married [[Faustus Cornelius Sulla (senator)|Faustus Cornelius Sulla]] , a politician who was the son of Roman dictator [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] from his wife 
[[Caecilia Metella]]. Pompeia bore Faustus three children (they are listed below). Around [[47 BC]], Faustus had died in the African War against Julius Caesar. Her two sons fell into the hands of Julius Caesar, however Caesar dismissed them and pardon them safely. 

After [[46 BC]], Pompeia married for a second time to politician [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna (suffect consul 32 BC)|Lucius Cornelius Cinna]], who was brother of Julius Caesar<U+2019>s first wife [[Cornelia Cinna minor]] and the maternal uncle of Caesar<U+2019>s late daughter with Cornelia, [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|Julia Caesaris]]. Pompeia bore Cinna two children (they are listed below). 

For a time Pompeia, had accompanied her younger brother Sextus Pompeius to [[Sicily]]. It was in Sicily, that Pompeia made various presents for the younger future [[Roman Emperor]] [[Tiberius]], who fled with his parents there from the [[Second Triumvirate]]. Pompeia gave Tiberius as presents a cloak, a brooch and some gold plaques. The historian Suetonius, states that these presents were preserved and were exhibited in [[Baiae]], in his time. Her younger brother survived Pompeia as she died before 35 BC.
