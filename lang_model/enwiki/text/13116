'''Vladimir Kren''' (8 December 1903 <U+2013> 2 December 1948) was a Croatian [[major general]] and commander of the [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] (ZNDH) during [[World War II]]. He was an officer in the [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] (VVKJ) before the war. In April 1941, he defected to [[Nazi Germany]] and handed over the locations of many of the  VVKJ's dispersal airfields and exposed many of its codes. This made it easier for the [[Luftwaffe]] to destroy the VVKJ during the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]], which commenced shortly after Kren's defection.

Kren was named the commander of the ZNDH upon returning to [[Zagreb]] in mid-April 1941 and served in this capacity until September 1943, when he voluntarily retired. In June 1944, Croatian leader [[Ante Paveli<U+0107>]] ordered that Kren be returned to active service within the ZNDH and had him re-appointed as its commander. In May 1945, Kren fled to Italy via Austria and was arrested by [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]]. He escaped from Allied custody in early 1947, but was arrested by British forces in March of that year while trying to board a ship bound for [[Argentina]]. He was then extradited to [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and put on trial in Zagreb. The Zagreb municipal court found him guilty of various offences and sentenced him to death by [[firing squad]]. He was executed in December 1948.

==Early life==
Vladimir Kren was born on 8 December 1903 in the village of [[Va<U+0161>ka]], near [[Slatina, Croatia|Podravska Slatina]]. He attended the [[Military Academy (Serbia)|Military Academy]] in [[Belgrade]]. He initially served as an infantry officer in the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] before being transferred to serve with the [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] ({{lang-sh|Vazduhoplovstvo Vojske Kraljevine Jugoslavije}}, VVKJ). Before the outbreak of [[World War II]], he was promoted to the rank of [[captain (armed forces)|captain]] within the Royal Yugoslav Army and served as a battalion commander at [[Zagreb Airport]].{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=207}}

==World War II==
[[File:Potez 25 1 (MAE).JPG|thumb|left|A [[Potez 25]] [[biplane]], similar to the one that Kren used during his defection in April 1941.]]
Kren began communicating with [[Usta<U+0161>e]] leader [[Slavko Kvaternik]] during the winter of 1940<U+2013>41, and became a full member of the Usta<U+0161>e in February 1941.{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=207}} That month, he and five other Croat officers of the Royal Yugoslav Army signed a memorandum in which they pledged loyalty to "the great German people and the great German [[F<U+00FC>hrer]]".{{sfn|Novi List|7 September 2011}}

On 3 April, [[Major]] Kren flew a [[Potez 25]] aircraft to the Austrian city of [[Graz]] and defected to the Germans.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} He declared himself as a member of the Usta<U+0161>e{{sfn|Neulen|2000|p=171}} and handed over the locations of many of the VVKJ's dispersal airfields as well as codes used by the VVKJ, which had to be quickly changed.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}}{{efn|Some accounts contend that he merely travelled to Graz in order to plead with the Germans to spare [[Zagreb]] from aerial bombardment by the Luftwaffe.{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=207}}}}

Kren's actions directly led to the swift destruction of the VVKJ by the [[Luftwaffe]].{{sfn|Go<U+00F1>i|2003|p=236}}{{efn|Author Uki Go<U+00F1>i alleges that Kren personally directed German aircraft to bomb specific targets during [[Operation Retribution (1941)|Operation Retribution]].{{sfn|Go<U+00F1>i|2003|p=236}}}} Nevertheless, the Germans detained Kren and held him until 11 April. He returned to Zagreb not long after he was set free. There, he was promoted to the rank of [[colonel]] and named commander of the [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-hr|Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Dr<U+017E>ave Hrvatske}}, ZNDH). He was promoted to the rank of [[General officer|general]] shortly afterwards. Later that year, he accompanied Croatian leader [[Ante Paveli<U+0107>]] on an official visit to [[Berlin]].{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=207}} 

Kren was retired from the ZNDH at his own request on 13 September 1943. Paveli<U+0107> subsequently transferred him to serve as an officer within his personal bodyguard.{{efn|Paveli<U+0107>'s personal bodyguard was known as ''Poglavnikova tjelesna bojna'' (or PTB) in [[Croatian language|Croatian]].{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=207}}}} In the summer of 1944, Kren served as a mediator between the ZNDH and Croatian politicians [[Mladen Lorkovi<U+0107>]] and [[Ante Voki<U+0107>]], the main conspirators behind the [[Lorkovi<U+0107><U+2013>Voki<U+0107> plot]]. In June 1944, Paveli<U+0107> personally ordered that Kren be returned to active service within the ZNDH and had him re-appointed as its commander. That summer, Kren visited an academy for young ZNDH pilots in Italy and toured [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], Germany and the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. During his stay in Germany, he negotiated the sale of German aircraft to the NDH and was granted access to several facilities that were used to manufacture the [[V-1 flying bomb]] and the [[V-2 rocket]].{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=207}}

==Demise==
At the beginning of May 1945, Kren left Zagreb and began withdrawing towards Austria. He managed to evade capture by the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] and escaped across the Yugoslav border into Italy. He was captured by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] there and placed in a prisoner-of-war camp in [[Grumo Appula]], near [[Bari]]. He was then transferred to a camp in [[Grottaglie]], where he remained until 1947.{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=207}} That year, Kren escaped from Allied custody while being transported by [[locomotive]] to another prisoner-of-war camp. He then went to [[Rome]] and hid there for a few months.{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|pp=207<U+2013>208}} In March 1947, British intelligence discovered that Kren was staying in [[Genoa]] under the protection of Monsignor Karlo Petranovi<U+0107> and that he was planning to leave for [[Argentina]] under the [[Pseudonym|alias]] Marko Rubini. Kren was arrested by British authorities on 4 March 1947 while attempting to board a ship called ''Philippa'', which regularly carried suspected Croatian war criminals along the Genoa<U+2013>[[Buenos Aires]] route. Eight other suspected war criminals were arrested alongside Kren.{{sfn|Go<U+00F1>i|2003|p=236}} Kren was extradited to [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] that same month.{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=208}} He was tried in Zagreb and on 22 October 1948 the city's municipal court found him guilty of [[mass murder]], [[terrorism]], forced mobilization, forced religious conversion, aerial bombardment of civilian areas, and the forced expulsion of civilians. He was sentenced to death by [[firing squad]].{{sfn|Novi List|7 September 2011}} Kren appealed the decision to the supreme court of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], but his appeal was dismissed on 9 November 1948.{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=208}} He was executed in Zagreb on 2 December 1948. In 2011, his granddaughter submitted an unsuccessful request for rehabilitation to the Zagreb District court.{{sfn|Novi List|7 September 2011}}
