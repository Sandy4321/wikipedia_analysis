'''William Messing''' is an [[United States|American]] mathematician who works in [[arithmetic algebraic geometry]].

Messing received his doctorate in 1971 at [[Princeton University]] under supervisions of [[Alexander Grothendieck]] (and [[Nicholas Katz]]) <U+200B><U+200B>with the thesis entitled ''The Crystals Associated to Barsotti<U+2013>Tate Groups: With Applications to Abelian Schemes.''<ref>[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=11998 Mathematics Genealogy Project]</ref> In 1972, he was a [[C.L.E. Moore instructor]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. He is currently a professor at the [[University of Minnesota]] ([[Minneapolis]]).

In his thesis, Messing elaborated Grothendieck's lecture at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] Nice 1970 on p-divisible groups ([[Barsotti<U+2013>Tate group]]s) that are important in algebraic geometry in prime characteristic, which were introduced in the 1950s by Dieudonn<U+00E9> in his study of Lie algebras over fields of finite characteristic. Messing worked together with [[Pierre Berthelot]], [[Barry Mazur]] and [[Aise Johan de Jong]].
