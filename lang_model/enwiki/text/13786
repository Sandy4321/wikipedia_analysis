'''''Pop''''' is the ninth studio [[album]] by [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[rock music|rock]] band [[U2]], released in March 1997. The album was a continuation of the band's 1990s reinvention, as they pursued a new musical direction by combining [[alternative rock]], [[techno music|techno]], [[electronic dance music|dance]], and [[electronica]] influences. The album employs a variety of production techniques relatively new to U2, including [[Sampling (music)|sampling]], [[Music loop|loop]]s, [[Programming (music)|programmed]] [[drum machine]]s, and [[Music sequencer|sequencing]].

Recording sessions began in 1995 with various [[record producer]]s, including [[Nellee Hooper]], [[Flood (producer)|Flood]], [[Howard Bernstein|Howie B]], and [[Steve Osborne]], who were introducing the band to various electronica influences. At the time, drummer [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]] was inactive due to a back injury, prompting the other band members to take different approaches to songwriting. Upon Mullen's return, the band began re-working much of their material but ultimately struggled to complete songs. After the band allowed [[music manager|manager]] [[Paul McGuinness]] to book their upcoming 1997 [[PopMart Tour]] before the album was completed, U2 were rushed into completing the album. Even after delaying the album's release date from the 1996 [[Christmas and holiday season]] to March 1997, U2 ran out of time in the studio and the final product was not to their liking. Since the album's release, many of its songs have been re-recorded and remixed. 

Although it reached #1 in 32 countries, including the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], ''Pop''{{'}}s lifetime sales are among the lowest in U2's catalogue, and critical reaction was mixed. ''Pop'' was certified [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on May 5, 1997.<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web

==Background and pre-recording==
In the first half of the 1990s, U2 underwent a dramatic shift in musical style. The band had experimented with [[alternative rock]] and [[electronic music]] and the use of [[Sampling (music)|samples]] on their 1991 album, ''[[Achtung Baby]]'', and, to a greater extent, on 1993's  ''[[Zooropa]]''. In 1995, the group's side-projects provided them an opportunity to delve even deeper into these genres. Bassist [[Adam Clayton]] and drummer [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]] remixed [[Mission: Impossible (film)#Theme song|the ''Mission: Impossible'' theme]] in an [[electronica]] style. The recording was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for "[[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance|Best Pop Instrumental Performance]]" in 1997 and was an international Top Ten hit. In 1995, U2 and [[Brian Eno]] recorded an [[experimental music|experimental]] album, ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]]'', under the moniker "Passengers". The project included [[Howie B]], [[Chuck D]], [[Akiko Kobayashi (singer)|Akiko Kobayashi]] and [[Luciano Pavarotti]], among others.

Bono and The Edge had written a few songs before recording started in earnest. "Wake Up Dead Man",<ref>* {{Cite book  | last = Fallon  | first = BP  | authorlink = BP Fallon   | title = U2, Faraway So Close  | publisher = Virgin Publishing Ltd  | date = 1994  | location = London  | pages =   | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = ISBN 0-86369-885-9}}
</ref> "[[Last Night on Earth]]" and "[[If God Will Send His Angels]]" were originally conceived during the ''Zooropa'' sessions.<ref>http://www.bpfallon.com/bp_books.html</ref> "[[Mofo (song)|Mofo]]" and "[[Staring at the Sun (U2 song)|Staring at the Sun]]" were also partly written and "If You Wear That Velvet Dress" came out of pre-production sessions with [[Nellee Hooper]].<ref name="sound" />

==Recording and production==
For the new record, U2 wanted to continue their sonic experimentation, and employed multiple [[music producer|producer]]s in order to have additional personnel to share ideas with.<ref name="sound" /> [[Flood (producer)|Flood]] was principal producer, having previously worked with the group as [[audio engineering|engineer]] for ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' and ''Achtung Baby'', and co-producer of ''Zooropa''. [[Mark Stent|Mark "Spike" Stent]] and Howie B were principal engineers. Flood described his job on ''Pop'' as a "...creative coordinator. There were some tracks where I didn't necessarily have a major involvement... but ultimately the buck stopped with me. I had the role of the creative supervisor who judged what worked and didn't work."<ref name="sound" /> Howie B first worked with the band for ''Original Soundtracks 1'' supplying [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]], treatments and [[scratching]]. On ''Pop'', he was initially given the role of "DJ and Vibes". Later, his roles became more defined as co-producer, engineer, and mixer. One of his main tasks was to introduce the band to sounds and influences within electronica. The band and Howie B regularly went out to [[dance club]]s to experience club music and culture.<ref name="sound" /> The overall goal for the record was to create a new sound for the band that was still recognizable as U2.<ref name="sound" />

U2 began work on ''Pop'' in mid-1995 in London, France and Ireland with Nellee Hooper.<ref name="sound" /> In September, the band moved the recording sessions to Hanover Quay in Dublin to a studio the band had just converted from a warehouse.<ref name="ubu-265">McCormick (2006), p. 265.</ref> The studio was designed to be rehearsal space more so than an actual studio.<ref name="ubu-265" /> Flood, Howie B, Steve Osborne, and [[Marius de Vries]] joined Hooper and the band there, with each of the producers incorporating their influences and experiences in electronic dance.<ref name="sound"/> Flood described Howie's influence thus: "Howie would be playing all kinds of records to inspire the band and for them to improvise to. That could be anything from a jazz trumpet solo to a super groove funk thing, with no holds barred. We also [[Programming (music)|programmed]] drum [[Music loop|loop]]s, or took things from sample CDs; anything to get the ball rolling. U2 arrive in the studio with very little finished material." These sessions lasted until December, and around 30-40 pieces of music emerged during this period.<ref name="sound" />

Mullen, who had mostly been absent from the sessions to start a family and nurse a worsening back injury, had major surgery on his back in November.<ref name="ubu-262">McCormick (2006), p. 262.</ref> Mullen was unable to drum properly during this period, forcing U2 to abandon their usual methods of songwriting and allowing them to pursue different musical influences.<ref name="sound" /> Mullen admits that he was upset that the band entered the studio without him, cognizant that key decisions would be made in the early months of recording.<ref name="ubu-262" /> Eno sent notes to the other band members attempting to convince them to wait for Mullen, but as The Edge explains, "The thinking was that we were going to further experiment with the notion of what a band was all about and find new ways to write songs, accepting the influence, and aesthetics of dance music... we thought, 'Let's just start with Howie mixing drum beats and see where that gets us.'"<ref name="ubu-262" /> Mullen was back in the studio three weeks after his surgery, but his back prevented him from dedicating as much time to recording as he wanted. As he described, "I needed a little more time to recover. But we were struggling with some of the material and for the project to move ahead, I had to put a lot of time in."<ref name="ubu-266">McCormick (2006), p. 266.</ref> Sessions ceased temporarily in January 1996 to allow Mullen to rehabilitate.<ref name="sound">{{cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/jul97/flood_u2.html |title=Pop Art: Flood & Howie B |work=Sound on Sound |date=July 1997 |first=Paul |last=Tingen |accessdate=2009-09-29}}</ref>

| quote = "It was quite hard for the band to shift from having played to [[Music loop|loop]]s of other people to playing to loops of themselves. We felt it was essential to do that, though, because you can get very lazy with [[Sampling (music)|sample]]s. They're an easy way to get the ball rolling, but you're always in danger of sounding like some basic samples with the band on top. You're in danger of being dictated to by what's there, rather than saying: 'this is just our springboard'."

Following Mullen's return and the sessions' resumption in February 1996, there was a three-month period in which Flood, Howie B, and Hooper production team attempted to re-work much of the band's material and better incorporate loops and [[Sampling (music)|sample]]s with the music ideas the band had created in 1995, which proved to be difficult.<ref name="sound" /> Mullen, in particular, had to record drum parts to replace some sampled loops that Howie B had used without permission.<ref name="ubu-266" /> Flood said, "We took what we had and got the band to play to it and work it into their own idiom, whilst incorporating a dance ethic... The groove-orientated way of making music can be a trap when there's no song; you end up just plowing along on one riff. So you have to try to get the groove and the song, and do it so that it sounds like the band, and do it so that it sounds like something new." 

Despite the initial difficulties with sampling, the band and production team eventually became comfortable with it, even sampling Mullen's drumming, Edge's guitar riffs, Clayton's bass lines, and Bono's vocalisations.<ref name="sound" /> Howie B sampled almost anything he could in order to find interesting sounds. He created [[Music sequencer|sequenced]] guitar sample patterns of The Edge's guitar work, which The Edge found very interesting, having never done it before. Howie B explained, "I made a lot of loops of Larry's playing, as well as guitar loops. Sometimes I would sample, say, a guitar, but it wouldn't come back sounding like a guitar; it might sound more like a [[pneumatic drill]], because I would take the raw sound and filter it, really destroy the guitar sound, and rebuild it into something completely different."<ref name="sound" /> Although sequencing was used, mostly on [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s, guitar loops, and some percussion, they were used sparingly out of fear of becoming a "slave" to them.<ref name="sound" />

Nellee Hooper left the sessions in May 1996 due to his commitments to the ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'' film score. The recording sessions changed radically in the last few months, which is why Hooper was not credited on the album.<ref name="sound" />

According to Flood, the production team worked to achieve a "sense of space" on the record's sound by layering all the elements of the arrangements and giving them places in the [[frequency spectrum]] where they did not interfere with each other through the continual experimenting and re-working of song arrangements. Flood says, "We had three different mixes of 'Mofo', and during mastering in November '96 in New York, I edited a final version of 'Mofo' from these three mixes. So even during mastering, we were trying to push the song to another level. It was a long process of experimentation; the album didn't actually come together until the last few months."<ref name="sound" /> 

{{Quote box

| quote = "Edge has been given this tag of having a certain type of sound, which isn't really fair, because on the last two or three albums he's already moved away from it; but people still perceive him as the man with the echoey guitar sound. So he was up for trying out all sorts of ideas, from using cheap pedals and getting the most ridiculous sounds, like in '[[Discoth<U+00E8>que (song)|Discoth<U+00E8>que]]', to very straight, naked guitar sounds, like in 'The Playboy Mansion'."
| source = &mdash;Flood, describing Edge's guitar work on ''Pop''<ref name="sound" />
| style = padding:10px;
}}

By forcing the band members out of their individual comfort zones, the producers were able to change their approach to songwriting and playing their instruments.<ref name="sound" /> Mullen, in particular, was forced to do this, as he used samples of other records, sample CDs, or [[Programming (music)|programmed]] drums while recuperating. Although he eventually reverted to recording his own samples, the experience of using others' changed his approach to recording rhythms.<ref name="sound" /><ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO0jGN9hYxk</ref> Clayton's bass guitar was heavy [[Audio signal processing|processed]], to the point that it sounded like a [[keyboard bass]] (an instrument utilized on "Mofo").<ref name="sound" /> The Edge wanted to steer away from the image he had since the 1980s as having an echo-heavy guitar sound. As a result, he was enthusiastic about experimenting with his guitar's sound, hence the [[Distortion (music)|distorted]] guitar sounds on the album, achieved with a variety of [[effects pedal]]s, [[synthesiser]]s and [[Sampler (musical instrument)|knob twiddling]]. Bono was very conscious of avoiding the vocal style present on previous albums, characterized by his bombastic style and his use of falsetto singing. The production team made his voice sound more intimate, up-front and raw as possible. As Flood explained, "You get his emotional involvement with the songs through the lyrics and the way he reacts to the music -- without him having to [[Spinal Tap (band)|go to 11]] all the time... We only used extreme effects on his voice during the recording, for him to get himself into a different place, and then, gradually, we pulled most effects out."<ref name="sound" />

During the recording sessions, U2 allowed [[music manager|manager]] [[Paul McGuinness]] to book their upcoming [[PopMart Tour]] before they had completed the album, putting the tour's start date at April 1997.<ref name="ubu-270">McCormick (2006), p. 270.</ref> The album was originally planned to be completed and released in time for the 1996 [[Christmas and holiday season]], but the band found themselves struggling to complete songs,<ref name="ubu-270" /> necessitating a delay in the album's release date until March 1997. Even with the extended timeframe to complete the album, recording continued up to the last minute.<ref name="ubu-270" /> Bono devised and recorded the chorus to "[[Last Night on Earth]]" on, ironically enough, the last night of the album's recording and mixing.<ref name="ubu-270" /> When Howie B and The Edge took the album to [[New York City]] to be [[Audio mastering|mastered]], changes and additions to the songs were still being made. During the process, Howie B was adding effects to "[[Discoth<U+00E8>que (song)|Discoth<U+00E8>que]]", while The Edge was recording [[backing vocals]] for "The Playboy Mansion". Of the last minute changes, The Edge said, "It's a sign of absolute madness."<ref name="ubu-270" />

U2 ultimately felt that ''Pop'' was not finished like they had wanted. The Edge described the finished album as "a compromise project by the end. It was a crazy period trying to mix everything and finish recording and having production meetings about the upcoming tour... If you can't mix something, it generally means there's something wrong with it..."<ref name="ubu-270" /> Mullen remarked that "If we had two or three more months to work, we would have had a very different record. I would like someday to rework those songs and give them the attention and time that they deserve."<ref name="ubu-270" /> McGuinness disagrees that the band did not have enough time, saying, "It got an awful lot of time, actually. I think it suffered from too many cooks [in the kitchen]. There were so many people with a hand in that record it wasn't surprising to me that it didn't come through as clearly as it might have done... It was also the first time I started to think that technology was getting out of control."<ref name="ubu-270" /> The band ended up re-working and re-recording many songs for the album's singles, as well as for the band's 2002 compilation ''[[The Best of 1990-2000]]''.

''Pop'' features [[tape loop]]s, programming, [[music sequencing|sequencing]], sampling, and heavy, funky dance rhythms.<ref>{{cite book | last =Graham | first =Bill | authorlink = | coauthors =van Oosten de Boer | title =U2: The Complete Guide to their Music | publisher =Omnibus Press | date =2004 | location =London | isbn = 0-7119-9886-8 | pages = 63<U+2013>64}}</ref> The Edge said in U2's fan magazine Propaganda that, "It's very difficult to pin this record down. It's not got any identity because it's got so many." Bono has said that the album "begins at a party and ends at a funeral", referring to the upbeat and party-like first half of the album and sombre and dark mood of the second half.

"[[Discoth<U+00E8>que (song)|Discoth<U+00E9>que]]", the lead single, begins with a distorted acoustic guitar that is passed through a  loud [[Audio amplifier|amplifier]] and a filter [[effects pedal|pedal]], along with being processed through a [[ARP 2600]] synthesizer. The song's riff and techno dance rhythm are then introduced. The break in the song's rhythm section features guitar sounds utilizing "[[Lovetone Big Cheese|Big Cheese]]", an effects pedal made by [[Lovetone]].<ref name="sound" />
 
"Do You Feel Loved", which was considered for a single release,<ref name="sound" />, runs at a slower pace and features electronic elements.

"[[Mofo (song)|Mofo]]" is the most overtly "techno" track on the record. Bono's lyrics lament the loss of his mother. There are little guitar and vocal samples that the band played and the production team sampled. They selected the bits that they liked, and then Edge played them back in a keyboard. ''Pop'''s producer Flood also put some of guitar work through the ARP 2600 on this track.<ref name="sound" />

"[[If God Will Send His Angels]]" is a ballad with Bono pleading for God's help. Like the other singles, the single version is different to the album version.  

"[[Staring at the Sun (U2 song)|Staring at the Sun]]" features acoustic guitars and a distorted guitar riff from Edge, and a simple rhythm section from Mullen. The backing track was played to the ARP 2600 running in free time, playing an odd drum-like sequence.

"[[Last Night on Earth]]" is anthemic with fuzzy, layered, guitars a funk-inspired bass line, and vocal harmonies during the song's bridge. 

"[[Gone (U2 song)|Gone]]" features a "siren" effect from Edge's guitar, complex [[krautrock]] style drums from Mullen and a funk-inspired bass line. This track was also considered for release as a single.<ref name="sound" /> Flood applied [[EMS VCS 3|VCS3]] spring reverb and ring modulation in a few places, and used it a lot on the basic rhythm track of this song.

"Miami" has a [[trip rock]] style. It begins with a drum loop, with Mullen's [[hi-hat]]s playing backwards through a very extreme [[equalization filter]]. Howie b explains, "The main groove is actually just Larry's hi-hat, but it sounds like a mad engine running or something really crazy -- about as far away from a hi-hat as you can imagine... the task in 'Miami' was to make it unlike anything else on the album, and also unlike anything else you'd ever have heard before." Edge also comes in with a frenetic guitar riff and Bono's affected vocal style singing about Miami in metaphors and descriptions of loud, brash Americana. In 2005, Q magazine included the song "Miami" in a list of "Ten Terrible Records by Great Artists".

"The Playboy Mansion" starts out with mellow, kitsch{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} guitar playing from Edge. Along with Mullen's drumming, here are breakbeats and hip-hop beats on the rhythm track, which were recorded as loops by Mullen. Howie described the loops thus; "Larry went off into a side room and made some sample loops of him playing his kit, and gave the loops to me and Flood. It was the same with the guitars; there's a guitar riff which comes in in the verse and chorus, which is a sample of Edge playing." Bono's lyrics are a tongue-in-cheek account of [[pop culture]] icons.

"If You Wear That Velvet Dress" features a mellow, dark atmosphere. Marius De Vries played keyboards on this track, contributing to the ambient feel. Mullen uses brush stroke style drums for the most part.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

"[[Please (U2 song)|Please]]" features Bono lamenting [[The Troubles]] and the Northern Irish peace process, pleading with the powers that be{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} to "get up off their knees". Mullen uses martial-style drumming, similar to "[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (song)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]". Flood put guitar work through the ARP 2600 on the song. He explains, "For ages the rhythm track played all the way through the track. It's a fairly tight groove/bass thing, and then we suddenly decided to drop out the rhythm section in the middle and add a load of strings and these weird synthetic sounds at the end of that break." The single releases and live performances of the song were different from the album version, with more prominent guitar playing and a guitar solo to end the song.

"Wake Up Dead Man" began as an upbeat song from the ''Achtung Baby'' sessions in 1991. It evolved into a darker composition during the ''Zooropa'' sessions, but it was shelved until ''Pop''. One of the band's darkest songs,<ref>http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postrock/2009/09/u2_discographically_speaking.html</ref> "Wake Up Dead Man" features Bono pleading with [[Jesus]] to return and save mankind,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,286986,00.html | title=RATTLE AND HYMN (1997) |publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | first = David | last = Browne | date = 1997-03-07 | accessdate = 2009-09-29}}</ref> evident in the lyrics "Jesus / Jesus help me / I'm alone in this world / And a fucked-up world it is too".

==Release==
''Pop'' was originally scheduled for a November 1996 release date, but after the recording sessions went long, the album was delayed until March 1997. This significantly cut into the band's rehearsal time for the upcoming PopMart Tour that they had scheduled in advance, which impacted the quality of the band's initial performances on tour.<ref name="contactmusic">{{cite web | url = http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/u2%20set%20to%20rerecord%20pop | title = U2 Set to Re-Record Pop | publisher = contactmusic.com | accessdate = 2006-10-31}}</ref>

===Singles===
''Pop'' featured six international singles, the most the band has released for a single album. "Do You Feel Loved" and "Gone" were also considered for release.<ref name="sound" />

The album's first single, "[[Discoth<U+00E8>que (song)|Discoth<U+00E8>que]]", was released on February 3, 1997 and was a huge dance and airplay success in the U.S. and UK.  It also reached #1 in the singles charts of most of European countries including the United Kingdom, where it was their third #1 single. In the United States, "Discoth<U+00E8>que" is notable for being U2's only single since 1991 to crack the top ten of the [[Billboard Hot 100]], peaking at #10. However, the song's dance elements and more humorous video (featuring U2 in a [[discotheque]] and even imitating [[the Village People]]) limited its appeal. This started a backlash against U2 and ''Pop'', limiting sales, as many fans felt that the band had gone a bit too far over-the-top in the self-mocking and "ironic" imagery.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The follow-up single "[[Staring at the Sun (U2 song)|Staring at the Sun]]" was released April 15, 1997 and became a Top 40 success in the U.S., but to a lesser extent, peaking at #26 on the Billboard Hot 100. "[[Last Night on Earth]]" was released as the third single on July 14, 1997, but did not crack the top 40, peaking at #57. "[[Please (U2 song)|Please]]", "[[If God Will Send His Angels]]", and "[[Mofo (song)|Mofo]]" were subsequently released as singles, but none reached the Top 100.

The ''[[Please: Popheart Live EP]]'', featuring four live tracks from the PopMart Tour, was also released in most regions. In the [[United States]], the four live tracks were instead released on the "Please" single, along with the single version of "Please," itself.

Upon its release, the album debuted at #1 in 35 countries, and drew mainly positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.u2.com/music/index.php?mode=full&news_id=1111&news_type=review | title = (U2 have) relaxed sufficiently to allow a certain funk into their music... | publisher = NME | accessdate = 2006-10-31}}; {{cite web | url = http://www.u2.com/music/index.php?mode=full&news_id=1110&news_type=review | title = U2 have not reinvented themselves so much as rediscovered themselves... | publisher = Sunday Times (UK) | accessdate = 2006-10-31}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave ''Pop''  a 4/5 star rating, praising the band's use of technology on the album: "U2 know that technology is ineluctably altering the sonic surface <U+2013> and, perhaps, even the very meaning <U+2013> of rock & roll." The review also stated that U2 had "pieced together a record whose rhythms, textures and visceral guitar mayhem make for a thrilling roller-coaster ride" and that the band had "defied the odds and made some of the greatest music of their lives."<ref name="rs" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the album a B rating, stating, "Despite its glittery launch, the album is neither trashy nor kitschy, nor is it junky-fun dance music. It incorporates bits of the new technology -- a high-pitched siren squeal here, a sound-collage splatter there -- but it is still very much a U2 album". Others felt that the album was a disappointment. Neil Strauss of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that "From the band's first album, ''[[Boy (album)|Boy]],'' in 1980, through ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' in 1987, U2 sounded inspired. Now it sounds expensive."<ref name="nyt" /> He further commented that "U2 and techno don't mix any better than U2 and irony do."<ref name="nyt" />  Although an early commercial success at the time of its release <U+2014> it reached number one in 32 countries, including the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and the [[United States|US]] <U+2014>''Pop''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s lifetime sales are among the lowest in U2's catalogue, and critical reaction was mixed. It was certified [[RIAA]] platinum once, the lowest since the band's album ''[[October (album)|October]]''.

Following the PopMart Tour, the band expressed their dissatisfaction with the final product. Between the album's various singles and the band's ''[[The Best of 1990<U+2013>2000]]'' compilation (and disregarding dance remixes and the like), the band has re-recorded, remixed, and rearranged "Discoth<U+00E8>que", "If God Will Send His Angels", "Staring at the Sun", "Last Night on Earth", "[[Gone (U2 song)|Gone]]", and "Please".

The band took a considerably more conservative, stripped down approach with ''Pop'''s follow-up, ''[[All That You Can't Leave Behind]]'', along with the [[Elevation Tour]] that supported it. The few songs from ''Pop'' that were performed on the Elevation Tour ("Discoth<U+00E8>que", "Gone", "Please", "Staring at the Sun", and "Wake Up Dead Man") were often presented in relatively bare-bones versions. On the [[Vertigo Tour]], songs from ''Pop'' were even more rarely played; "Discoth<U+00E8>que" was played twice at the beginning of the third leg, while other ''Pop'' songs appeared merely as snippets. This trend would continue for future tours.

==PopMart Tour==
[[File:U2-LiveInReggioEmilia-19970920-Stage.jpg|thumb|200px|The PopMart stage, including the B-stage, the LED screen, the golden arch that supported the overhead sound system, the Lemon mirror ball, and the olive and martini stick]]
{{Main|PopMart Tour}}
In support of the album, the band launched the PopMart Tour. Consisting of four legs and a total of 94 shows, the tour took the band to [[stadium]]s worldwide from April 1997 to March 1998. Much like the band's previous [[Zoo TV Tour]], PopMart was elaborately-staged, featured a lavish set, and saw the band embrace an ironic and self-mocking image. The band's performances and the tour's stage design poked fun at the themes of [[consumerism]] and embraced [[pop culture]]. Along with the reduced rehearsal time that affected initial shows, the tour suffered from technical difficulties and mixed reviews from critics and fans over the tour's extravagance.

The Malaysian edition of ''Pop'' has a censored version of "Wake Up Dead Man", omitting the word "fucked (up)" from the song, a rare instance of the band using profanity in their music.
