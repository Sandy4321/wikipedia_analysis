'''Robert Earle Clarke''', [[Order of Canada|O.C.]] (born [[August 13]], [[1949]] in [[Flin Flon, Manitoba|Flin Flon]], [[Manitoba]]), better known as '''Bobby Clarke''', is a retired [[Canada|Canadian]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[Center (ice hockey)|center]] who played his entire [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) career with the [[Philadelphia Flyers]]. During his 15 season playing career, he led the Flyers to two [[Stanley Cup]]s and was awarded the [[Hart Trophy]] as league MVP three times. A 1987 inductee into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], Clarke was rated number 23 on [[The Hockey News]]' list of ''The Top 100 NHL Players of All-Time'' in 1998.<ref>Steve Dryden, [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0771041756/ The Top 100 NHL Players of All-Time], 1998</ref>

A talented playmaker, he had three 100-point seasons, twice led the league in assists,<ref name="BSBblogspot">{{Cite web|url=http://broadstreetbullies.blogspot.com/2006/05/bobby-clarke.html|title=Philadelphia Flyers Legends: Bobby Clarke|accessdate=2007-07-08|publisher=BroadStreetBullies.blogspot.com|year=2006}}</ref> and played in eight [[NHL All-Star Game]]s. He was also a great defensive player, a great checker, and one of the best in the face-off circle. One of the game's great leaders, Clarke was the captain of the notorious Broad Street Bullies during their heyday in the mid-[[1970s in sports|1970s]]. The Bullies were a reflection of their captain, who had a tireless work ethic, a strong will to win, and a willingness to do anything it took to win even if it meant bending the rules.<ref name="1972SummitSeries">{{Cite web|url=http://www.1972summitseries.com/clarke.html|title=Clarke Did What He Had To Do|accessdate=2007-07-08|publisher=1972summitseries.com|year=2007}}</ref> The latter, some say,<ref>Steve Simmons, [http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Columnists/Simmons/2005/11/08/1297735-sun.html Nobody will let Clarke forget slash], accessed July 8, 2007</ref> is exemplified best by Clarke's infamous slash to the ankle of [[Valeri Kharlamov]] during the [[Summit Series]] in 1972, which is still the source of controversy to the present day.<ref name="Slashof72">{{Cite web|url=http://proicehockey.about.com/library/blhenderson-clarke.htm|title=Classic Hockey Quotes - great hockey quotes past and present|accessdate=2007-07-08|publisher=proicehockey.about.com|year=2007}}</ref>

Clarke retired following the [[1983-84 NHL season|1983-84]] season with 358 goals and 852 assists for a total of 1210 points in 1144 games, and immediately became general manager of the Flyers. He spent 19 of the following 23 seasons as a GM of the Flyers, also briefly serving as GM of the [[Minnesota North Stars]] and [[Florida Panthers]], and reached the Stanley Cup Finals three times with the Flyers and once with Minnesota. His time as an NHL GM had its share of controversy, perhaps none greater than the rift between him and star player [[Eric Lindros]] during the late [[1990s]] and early [[2000s in sports|2000s]]. He resigned from the GM position less than a month into the [[2006-07 NHL season|2006-07]] season and is currently the Flyers Senior Vice President.

==Early life==
[[Image:Clarke bombers.JPG|thumb|right|Clarke's Bombers jersey on display at the [[2007 Memorial Cup]].]]Born in the small northern Manitoban mining town of Flin Flon,<ref name="Russia"/> Clarke began playing organized hockey when he was eight years old.<ref name="HonouredPlayer">{{Cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=P198701&type=Player&page=bio&list=ByName#photo|title=The Legends - Honoured Player - Bobby Clarke - Biography|accessdate=2007-07-08|publisher=LegendsofHockey.net|year=2007}}</ref> Around the time he was 12 or 13 years old, he learned he had [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]].<ref name="Spotlight">{{Cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/spot_oneononep198701.htm|title=Spotlight - One on One with Bobby Clarke|accessdate=2007-07-08|publisher=LegendsofHockey.net|year=2003}}</ref> Even though he progressed into a highly touted prospect playing for the [[Flin Flon Bombers]], leading the league in which the Bombers played in scoring in each of his last three years of junior hockey, NHL teams feared Clarke would never be able to play in the NHL because of his diabetes.<ref name="Russia">{{Cite web|url=http://english.sport-express.ru/articles/9_68/|title=Sport Express - Bobby Clarke: "I WAS NO FIGHTER..."|accessdate=2007-07-08|publisher=Sports Express Daily|year=2006}}</ref> Bombers coach [[Pat Ginnell]] took Clarke to the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Minnesota]] following the 1967-68 season and the doctors concluded that as long as he took care of himself he could play professionally.<ref name="HonouredPlayer"/> Ginnell asked the doctors to write that statement down and when NHL scouts came to watch the Bombers play during the 1968-69 season, Ginnell showed them the doctor's verdict.<ref name="HonouredPlayer"/>

Even with such assurances Clarke fell to the second round of the [[1969 NHL Amateur Draft]] and was finally selected by the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] 17th overall. After [[Gerry Melnyk]], a scout and administrative assistant with the Flyers, tried to convince general manager [[Bud Poile]] to draft Clarke with their first round pick and failed<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF">{{Cite web|url=http://www.flyershistory.net/cgi-bin/hofprof.cgi?002|title=Flyers History - Hall of Fame Profile - Bobby Clarke|accessdate=2007-07-08|publisher=FlyersHistory.net|year=2007}}</ref> &mdash; Poile drafted [[Bob Currier]] instead, a player who retired five years later and, ironically, never played a game in the NHL; Melnyk called a diabetes specialist in Philadelphia who said Clarke would be fine if he looked after his health.<ref name="Russia"/><ref name="Spotlight"/><ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/> Melnyk then successfully convinced Poile to draft Clarke when the Flyers second round pick came around.<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/> The [[Detroit Red Wings]] and [[Montreal Canadiens]] immediately offered the Flyers a deal for Clarke, Detroit offering two veteran players and Montreal offering a deal "Flyers management could hardly refuse."<ref name="HonouredPlayer"/> The Flyers refused both offers and made it clear Clarke was not for sale.<ref name="HonouredPlayer"/>

After he suffered two serious diabetic seizures during training camp that fall after eating light breakfasts,<ref name="HonouredPlayer"/> Flyers trainer and equipment manager [[Frank Lewis (ice hockey)|Frank Lewis]] came up with a pre-game diet plan that Clarke followed the rest of his career.<ref name="HonouredPlayer"/> He would drink a bottle of [[Coca-Cola]] with three spoons of dissolved sugar before a game, drink a half glass of orange juice with sugar added between periods, and then a full glass following the game.<ref name="HonouredPlayer"/> Lewis also kept chocolate bars and a tube of glucose in his bag on hand in case of an emergency.<ref name="HonouredPlayer"/>

==NHL career==
[[Image:Bobby_clark_jersey.jpg|thumb|right|Bobby Clarke's jersey hanging in the Hockey Hall of Fame.]]Wearing #16, Clarke made his NHL debut on [[October 11]], [[1969]] against the [[Minnesota North Stars]].<ref>FlyersHistory.net, [http://www.flyershistory.net/cgi-bin/boxscore.cgi?19690004 11-Oct-69 - Philadelphia Flyers 0 @ Minnesota North Stars 4]</ref> He recorded his first point on [[October 22]] against the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], an assist on [[Lew Morrison]]'s 3rd period goal,<ref>FlyersHistory.net, [http://www.flyershistory.net/cgi-bin/boxscore.cgi?19690028 22-Oct-69 - Philadelphia Flyers 4 @ Toronto Maple Leafs 3]</ref> and he scored his first goal on [[October 30]] against the [[New York Rangers]], beating Rangers goaltender [[Ed Giacomin]] 16:36 into the 3rd period.<ref>FlyersHistory.net, [http://www.flyershistory.net/cgi-bin/boxscore.cgi?19690047 30-Oct-69 - New York Rangers 3 @ Philadelphia Flyers 3]</ref> Clarke played the entire 76-game schedule his rookie season, recording 46 points (15 goals, 31 assists) and earning a trip to the [[NHL All-Star Game]].<ref name="FlyersHistoryStats"/> Clarke led the Flyers in scoring during his sophomore season, [[1970-71 NHL season|1970-71]], with 27 goals and 36 assists for a total of 63 points in 77 games. His efforts helped the Flyers make the playoffs, but Clarke was held scoreless in his first playoff action and the Flyers lost in four games to the [[Chicago Black Hawks]].<ref name="HonouredPlayer"/>

A [[tooth abscess]] was the cause of a slow start to the [[1971-72 NHL season|1971-72]] season;<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/> 20 pounds underweight, Clarke only managed 5 goals and 11 assists 31 games into the season.<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/> He rebounded over the final 47 games, scoring 30 goals and 35 assists<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/> and bringing his totals to 35 goals and 46 assists. His dedication was rewarded when he became the first Flyer to win a major NHL award, the [[Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy]],<ref name="HonouredPlayer"/> and the Flyers re-signed him to a 5-year contract worth $100,000 per season, a raise of $75,000 per season.<ref name="FlyersHistoryStats">{{Cite web|url=http://www.flyershistory.net/cgi-bin/player.cgi?Bobby_Clarke|title=Individual Player Stats - Bobby Clarke|accessdate=2007-07-11|publisher=flyershistory.net|year=2007}}</ref>

A few months following his strong play during the [[Summit Series]] for [[Canadian national men's hockey team|Team Canada]], Clarke was named the Flyers team captain at age 23, the youngest to ever assume that role in NHL history at the time.<ref name="BSBblogspot"/> As leader of the brawling Broad Street Bullies, Clarke became the first player from an [[1967 NHL Expansion|expansion team]] to score more than 100 points in a season,<ref name="BSBblogspot"/> 104 points (37 goals, 67 assists) total. Facing the [[Minnesota North Stars]] in the first round, the Flyers and Clarke received a scare. Clarke was hit in the eye with a stick which broke his contact lens and was rushed to the hospital.<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/> After removing parts of his broken contact from under the eye, Clarke returned to the lineup the next game despite having suffered a scratched cornea<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/> and the Flyers won their first playoff series. The Flyers lost to the [[Montreal Canadiens]] during the next round, but Clarke was later awarded the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] as the league's MVP.

Clarke's production fell to 87 points in 77 games during the [[1973-74 NHL season|1973-74]] regular season, but his leadership and [[Bernie Parent]]'s stellar goaltending led the Flyers to the second best record in the league and to the Stanley Cup Finals to play the team with the best record, the [[Boston Bruins]]. After losing Game 1, Clarke scored arguably the biggest goal of his career in overtime of Game 2, putting a rebound shot in over Bruins goaltender [[Gilles Gilbert]].<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/> The Flyers won three of the next four games and became the first expansion team to win the [[Stanley Cup]].<ref name="BSBblogspot"/> Clarke was later awarded the [[Lester B. Pearson Award]] as the players MVP. Clarke set the NHL record, at the time, for most assists by a centerman with 89<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/> during the [[1974-75 NHL season|1974-75]] season on his way to a 116 point season. The Flyers returned to the Stanley Cup Finals and defeated the [[Buffalo Sabres]] in six games, repeating as Stanley Cup champions. In addition to the second championship, Clarke was awarded the Hart Trophy for the second time.

[[1975-76 NHL season|1975-76]] was a record breaking season for Clarke. Playing on the LCB line with [[Reggie Leach]] and [[Bill Barber]], the trio set a record for most goals by a line with 141.<ref name="17thoverall">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hockeydraftcentral.com/1969/69017.html|title=1969 NHL Amateur Draft - Bobby Clarke|accessdate=2007-07-08|publisher=HockeyDraftCentral.com|year=2007}}</ref> He also tied his mark of the previous season with 89 assists and set a personal best and franchise record for most points in a single season with 119 (later broken by [[Mark Recchi]] in [[1992-93 NHL season|1992-93]]).<ref>FlyersHistory.net, {{Cite web|url=http://www.flyershistory.com/best.htm|title=Flyers History - Career and Season Records|accessdate=2007-07-12|publisher=FlyersHistory.net|year=2007}}</ref> The Flyers, without Parent and [[Rick MacLeish]],<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/> returned to the Finals, but were swept by Montreal. Clarke was awarded the Hart Trophy one final time as the league's MVP. Clarke's production would drop off over the next few seasons; in fact, his point total fell six seasons in a row. But the Flyers remained contenders, reaching the semifinals and losing to Boston in [[1976-77 NHL season|1976-77]] and [[1977-78 NHL season|1977-78]].

After a quarterfinal loss to the Rangers in [[1978-79 NHL season|1978-79]], Clarke was named an assistant coach.<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/> In order to become an assistant he had to give up the captaincy due to NHL rules,<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/> so [[Mel Bridgman]] was named the 4th captain in Flyers history. His first season as a playing assistant coach, [[1979-80 NHL season|1979-80]], saw the Flyers go on an undefeated streak of 35 games, not only the longest in NHL history, but the longest in North American professional sports history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.flyershistory.net/streak.htm|title=The Streak - 1979-80 Philadelphia Flyer 35 Game Undefeated Streak|accessdate=2007-07-12|publisher=flyershistory.net|year=2007}}</ref> The Flyers made it to the Stanley Cup Finals before losing to the [[New York Islanders]] in six games. During the playoffs, Clarke scored 8 goals and assisted on 12 others in 19 games, all 8 goals coming on the power play.<ref name="FlyersHistoryStats"/> Following the playoffs, Clarke was awarded the [[Lester Patrick Trophy]] along with Flyers owner [[Ed Snider]] and former Flyers coach [[Fred Shero]].

During the [[1980-81 NHL season|1980-81]] season, Clarke hit a personal milestone in memorable fashion. On March 19, 1981 during a game against the [[Boston Bruins]], a Reggie Leach slapshot struck Clarke.<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/> After leaving the ice, he re-appeared moments later stitched up and with his jersey covered in blood.<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/> 31 seconds into the third period Clarke beat Bruins goalie [[Marco Baron]] for his 19th goal of the season<ref name="1000thpoint">{{Cite web|url=http://www.flyershistory.com/cgi-bin/boxscore.cgi?19800073|title=19-Mar-81 - Boston Bruins 3 @ Philadelphia Flyers 5|accessdate=2007-07-12|publisher=flyershistory.net|year=2007}}</ref> and his [[List of NHL players with 1000 points|1000th career point]].<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/>

Despite his diabetes and hard-nosed play, Clarke proved to be remarkably durable. A broken foot suffered during the [[1981-82 NHL season|1981-82]] season<ref name="FlyersHistoryStats"/> limited him to 62 games, the only time in his career he played fewer than 70 games in a season.  No longer an assistant coach, Clarke reassumed the captaincy from Bill Barber during [[1982-83 NHL season|1982-83]]. He skated in his [[List of NHL players with 1000 games played|1000th career game]] on October 23, 1982 against the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]. Clarke had his best season since 1977-78, scoring 85 points in 80 games. He also won the [[Frank J. Selke Trophy]], given annually to the league's best defensive forward. After the Flyers were eliminated from the playoffs in the first round for the third straight season in [[1983-84 NHL season|1983-84]] and the general manager position opened up after [[Bob McCammon]] resigned,<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/> Clarke retired on [[May 15]], [[1984]] to become the General Manager of the Flyers.<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/>

==International play==
{{seealso|Canadian national men's hockey team}}

Clarke played for Team Canada three times during his career. He played a major role in defeating the Soviet Union during the [[Summit Series]] in 1972, captained the Canadian team to gold at the [[1976 Canada Cup]], and won a bronze medal at the 1982 World Championships. In addition, he led the Flyers to the only [[Flyers versus Red Army|outright victory]] over the Soviet Union's best team, Soviet Red Army, during the 1976 [[Super Series]], and took part in the [[1979 Challenge Cup]] with the NHL All-Stars. After his playing career, he served as one of Canada's four general managers during the [[1987 Canada Cup|1987]] and [[1991 Canada Cup]]s<ref name="17thoverall"/> and served as Canada's lone GM during the [[1998 Winter Olympics]].

===Summit Series===
Coming off his third NHL season, Clarke was the last player Team Canada selected to play in the Summit Series.<ref name="1972SummitSeries"/> His line with [[Ron Ellis]] and [[Paul Henderson]] turned out to be Canada's best during the series,<ref name="1972SummitSeries"/> Clarke tallying two goals and four assists in the eight game series won by Canada as well as being awarded Team Canada MVP in game one of the series.<ref name="1972SummitSeries"/> Clarke's play earned the respect of many during the series, Henderson saying, "The best thing that could have happened to Ronnie (Ellis) and me was to get this young kid making plays for us. He was terrific!"<ref name="1972SummitSeries"/> [[Wayne Cashman]] would add, "There were guys on Team Canada who took their game to new heights in that series. A perfect example would be Bobby Clarke."<ref name="1972SummitSeries"/> The Russian team's head coach, [[Boris Kulagin]], thought Clarke was Canada's best player.<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/> Though he earned much praise due to his play, he was also criticized for an incident during the sixth game which is often referred to as, "The Slash."<ref name="Slashof72"/>

Clarke's line played against the line of the Soviet's top player, [[Valeri Kharlamov]], during the entire series.<ref name="Russia"/> After being on the receiving end of some stick work from Kharlamov while going for the puck,<ref name="Russia"/> Clarke caught up with Kharlamov and laid a two-handed slash across his already sore ankle.<ref name="Russia"/> The slash broke Kharlamov's ankle<ref name="Kharlamov"/> and, though he finished the game, he missed the seventh game and was largely ineffective in the eighth.<ref name="Kharlamov"/> When asked about the slash years later, Clarke said, "If I hadn't learned to lay on a two-hander once in a while, I'd never have left Flin Flon."<ref name="1972SummitSeries"/> 30 years after the series, Henderson criticized Clarke, calling the slash, "the low point of the series."<ref name="Slashof72"/> Clarke responded saying that he thought it was, "improper to criticize a teammate 30 years later," and that he didn't, "understand why he would bring it up now."<ref name="Slashof72"/> Kharlamov, prior to his death in 1981, said he thought Clarke was tasked with, "taking me out of the game."<ref name="Kharlamov">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chidlovski.com/personal/1972/yroster/ru17.htm|title=The Summit in 1972: Players Info - Valery Kharlamov|accessdate=2007-07-13|publisher=chidlovski.com|year=2004}}</ref> [[John Ferguson, Sr.]], an assistant coach with Team Canada in 1972, said, "I called Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs a tap on the ankle.' I didn't think twice about it. It was Us versus Them. And Kharlamov was killing us. I mean, somebody had to do it. And I sure wasn't going to ask Henderson."<ref name="Slashof72"/> Clarke, however, does not recall Ferguson telling him this.<ref name="Russia"/>

===Nagano Olympics===
Named general manager of Team Canada on January 30, 1997,<ref name="17thoverall"/> Clarke was tasked with picking which NHLers would compete for Canada at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in Nagano, the first time NHLers would compete in the Olympics. A few of Clarke's choices were the source of some consternation, in particular omitting [[Mark Messier]] in favor of relative unknown [[Rob Zamuner]]<ref>canoe.ca, [http://www.canoe.ca/SlamNaganoHockey/zamuner.html SLAM! NAGANO PROFILE: Rob Zamuner]</ref> and choosing 24-year-old [[Eric Lindros]] as the team's captain over the likes of [[Wayne Gretzky]], [[Ray Bourque]], and [[Steve Yzerman]].<ref>canoe.ca, [http://www.canoe.ca/SlamNaganoHockey/lindros.html SLAM!

==NHL management==
{{seealso|History of the Philadelphia Flyers}}

Following his retirement, Clarke's first stint as Flyers general manager lasted six seasons and included two trips to the Stanley Cup Finals in [[1984-85 NHL season|1985]] and [[1986-87 NHL season|1987]]. After making the playoffs in each of his first five seasons in the front office, the Flyers fell off during the [[1989-90 NHL season|1989-90]] season and missed the playoffs. [[Jay Snider]] fired Clarke following the season<ref>nytimes.com, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDC163DF934A25757C0A966958260 SPORTS PEOPLE: HOCKEY, Flyers Dismiss Clarke]</ref> and Clarke moved on to the [[Minnesota North Stars]]<ref>nytimes.com, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3DC1739F93AA35755C0A966958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print SPORTS PEOPLE: HOCKEY, North Stars Hire Clarke As General Manager]</ref> and spent two seasons as the North Stars GM, one of which saw a surprise run to the Finals in [[1990-91 NHL season|1991]].<ref name="17thoverall"/> Leaving Minnesota, Clarke returned to Philadelphia to assume the role of Senior Vice President during the [[1992-93 NHL season|1992-93]] season, and served as a mentor for young phenom Eric Lindros during his first season.<ref name="17thoverall"/> Clarke moved on shortly after and took the general manager position with the expansion [[Florida Panthers]], a team which set the expansion team record for wins and points during a season in [[1993-94 NHL season|1993-94]]. He returned to the role of Flyers GM prior to the [[1994-95 NHL season|1994-95]] season (Florida was compensated with cash and the [[Ryan Johnson (ice hockey)|36th overall pick]] in the [[1994 NHL Entry Draft]]),<ref>nytimes.com, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E2DE173DF935A25755C0A962958260&n=Top%2fNews%2fSports%2fHockey%2fNational%20Hockey%20League%2fFlorida%20Panthers SPORTS PEOPLE: HOCKEY, Compensation for Clarke]</ref> and he rebuilt the team into a Cup contender. Though the Flyers only reached the Finals once ([[1996-97 NHL season|1996-97]]) during his second tenure as Flyers GM, the Flyers made the playoffs 11 seasons in a row. Following a poor start to the [[2006-07 NHL season|2006-07]] season, Clarke resigned citing a possible burnout and a lack of desire.<ref name="Resignation">{{Cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2634817|title=Flyers GM Clarke resigns; coach Hitchcock fired|accessdate=2007-07-26|publisher=ESPN.com|year=2006}}</ref> Clarke returned to the franchise on December 4, 2006 and was named Senior Vice President.

===Controversy and criticism===
Clarke failed to win a Stanley Cup over the 22 seasons he was a general manager. During his 19 seasons as Flyers GM, the Flyers were typically considered Stanley Cup contenders and amassed a regular season record of 714-443-199<ref>philadelphiaflyers.com, [http://flyers.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NHLPage&id=10858 Bob Clarke - Senior Vice President]</ref> but for one reason or another always came up short.<ref name="Doomed"/> While goaltending was a strength during his first stint with two [[Vezina Trophy]] winners between the pipes ([[Pelle Lindbergh]] and [[Ron Hextall]]), only Hextall in 1995, a combination of Hextall and [[Garth Snow]] in 1997, [[Brian Boucher]] in [[1999-2000 NHL season|2000]], and [[Robert Esche]] in [[2003-04 NHL season|2004]] got the Flyers past the second round of the playoffs during his second stint. To make matters worse, [[Martin Brodeur]] and the [[New Jersey Devils]], their [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division]] rivals, beat the Flyers twice on the way to that franchise's first two Stanley Cups in 1995 and 2000.<ref name="Doomed">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefourthperiod.com/columnists/wyshynski061023.html|title=The Legion of Doomed|accessdate=2007-07-26|publisher=The Fourth Period|year=2006}}</ref>

Clarke received his harshest criticism after first round playoff exits, including a string of four in five years from 1998 to 2002,<ref name="Resignation"/> and several coaching changes. After [[Terry Murray]] was fired following the team's disappointing showing in the Stanley Cup Finals in 1997, five more coaching changes were made in the next five years. Some suggested his handling of [[Roger Neilson]] in 2000, who took a medical leave to undergo cancer treatment and was replaced by [[Craig Ramsay]], was disrespectful. The firing of Bill Barber following a first round exit in 2002 led to calls for Clarke's dismissal. Clarke hired [[Ken Hitchcock]] shortly after and Hitchcock remained the head coach until Clarke's resignation four years later.<ref name="Resignation"/>

Following the [[2004-05 NHL Lockout]], Clarke signed 6'5" defensemen [[Derian Hatcher]] and [[Mike Rathje]] to four-year and five-year contracts respectively.<ref name="Doomed"/> While the moves were initially praised<ref name="Doomed"/> and even led some to label the Flyers Cup favorites in [[2005-06 NHL season|2005-06]],<ref name="Doomed"/> some suggested Clarke couldn't compete in the new NHL after the team was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Buffalo, a smaller, quicker team that skated circles around the slow-footed Hatcher and Rathje.<ref name="Resignation"/><ref name="Doomed"/> Such criticisms became louder after a poor start to the following season which led to his resignation.<ref name="Resignation"/>

====Eric Lindros====
Nothing was more controversial during Clarke's time as a general manager than his dispute with Eric Lindros and his parents. The trouble started following the [[1997-98 NHL season|1997-98]] season while negotiating a new contract for Lindros. Clarke threatened to trade him, saying, "If you want to be the highest-paid player in the game or close to it, you've got to play that way."<ref>ESPN.com, [http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Lindros_Eric.html ESPN Classic - Great expectations haunt talented Lindros]</ref> While Lindros wasn't traded and he played well during the [[1998-99 NHL season|1998-99]] season, his season was cut short after sustaining a collapsed lung during a game on April 1 against the [[Nashville Predators]].<ref name="Lindros">{{Cite web|url=http://apse.dallasnews.com/contest/2000/writing/over250.news.first.html|title=How it all began|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=Philadelphia Inquirer|year=2000}}</ref> Lindros' parents criticized team trainer John Worley and claimed Clarke tried to kill their son by trying to put him on a plane back to Philadelphia, which would have been fatal given his condition.<ref name="Lindros"/>

After Lindros criticized Worley in March 2000 for failing to diagnose a concussion<ref name="Lindros"/> (his second of the season),<ref name="88timeline">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2000/11/30/lindros001129.html|title=Eric Lindros timeline|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=CBC.ca|year=2000}}</ref> Clarke stripped Lindros of the role of team captain.<ref name="Lindros"/> A few weeks after suffering a third concussion during practice,<ref name="88timeline"/> Lindros returned to the Flyers lineup for Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals and sustained his fourth concussion of the season (his sixth in 27 months) during Game 7.<ref name="88timeline"/> Afterwards, Clarke said he didn't dislike Eric, but he had a problem with his parents, saying, "If he's going to come back, he can't have his dad calling us and telling us who to trade for and who he wants to play with Eric and who can't play with Eric."<ref>CNNSI.com, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/news/2001/08/17/lindros_history/ Eric Lindros' concussion history]</ref> Lindros never played for the Flyers again. He rejected the Flyers qualifying offer in the off-season and sat out the [[2000-01 NHL season|2000-01]] season. Clarke finally traded Lindros to the New York Rangers in August 2001. Following the trade, Clarke said, "I don't give a crap whether he ever plays again or if I ever see him again. All he ever did was cause aggravation to our team."<ref>About.com, [http://proicehockey.about.com/b/a/255971.htm Bob Clarke: A Farewell to Hockey's King of Quotes]</ref>

==Legacy==
On November 15, 1984, Bobby Clarke Night was held at the [[Wachovia Spectrum|Spectrum]]<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/>. The Flyers retired Clarke's #16 jersey and unveiled the [[Bobby Clarke Trophy]] which is awarded annually to the Flyers' Most Valuable Player.<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/> Three years later Clarke was a first ballot inductee into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]].<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/> The Flyers created a team Hall of Fame in 1988, and the first two inductees were Clarke and Bernie Parent.<ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/>

In addition to his NHL honors, Clarke was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] (O.C.). The trophy he won in 1968 and 1969 with the Bombers, given annually to the [[Western Hockey League]]'s top scorer, was re-named the [[Bob Clarke Trophy]]. He was inducted into two more halls of fame, the [[Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame]] in 2003 as a charter member and [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]] in 2005.

===Records===
Clarke finished his career 4th all-time in assists and 11th all-time in points,<ref>NHL.com, [http://www.nhl.com/features/clarke_qa101804.html Clarke's goal: Another Cup in Philly]</ref> but he has since fallen to 22nd all-time in assists and 40th all-time in points (as of completion of [[2006-07 NHL season]]). His back-to-back 89 assist seasons in 1974-75 and 1975-76 is still the Flyers team record<ref>flyershistory.net, [http://www.flyershistory.net/cgi-bin/rec-scoring.cgi Flyers Scoring Records - Single Season - Assists - All Players]</ref> and he also owns several other [[Philadelphia Flyers records]],<ref>flyershistory.net, [http://www.flyershistory.net/best.htm Flyers History - Career and Season Records]</ref> including:
