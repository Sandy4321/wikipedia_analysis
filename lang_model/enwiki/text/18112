The '''Houston Rockets''' are an [[Major North American professional sports teams|American professional]] [[basketball]] team based in [[Houston, Texas]]. They play in the [[Southwest Division (NBA)|Southwest Division]] of the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] in [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). The team was established in 1967, and played in [[San Diego]], [[California]] for four years, before being moved to [[Houston]], [[Texas]].

The Rockets first made the [[NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] in 1969, and the [[NBA Conference Finals|conference finals]] in 1977, but lost twice in the [[NBA Finals]], in [[1981 NBA Finals|1981]] and [[1985 NBA Finals|1985]], to the [[Boston Celtics]]. They did not win their first championship until they drafted future Hall-of-Famer [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], who led them to consecutive championships in [[1994 NBA Finals|1994]] and [[1995 NBA Finals|1995]]. However, the Rockets have not advanced past the first round of the playoffs in 13 years.<ref name="houstonindex" />

==Franchise history==
===San Diego Rockets===
The Rockets were founded in 1967 in [[San Diego]], and after being bought by Robert Breitbard for 1.75&nbsp;million [[United States dollar|dollars]],<ref name="chronhistory"/> they joined the NBA as an expansion team for the [[1967-68 NBA season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/uniforms_rockets.html|title=Going Retro: Houston Rockets|publisher=NBA.com|accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref> The San Diego franchise, which was named the Rockets due to the city calling itself "a city of motion",<ref name="chronhistory">{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/first100/1050922.html|title=Owners, fans waited years before Rockets took off|date=[[September 20]], [[2001]]|publisher=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref> played its games in the [[San Diego Sports Arena]].

Despite being coached by Hall-of-Fame coach [[Alex Hannum]], the Rockets only tallied a 57-97 record in the following two seasons, and did not make the playoffs in either season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SDR/1970.html|title=1969-70 San Diego Rockets|publisher=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SDR/1971.html|title=1970-71 San Diego Rockets|publisher=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref> Because of the low performance and attendance, Breitbard looked to sell the team,<ref name="chronhistory"/> and in 1971, Texas Sports Investments, which was led by real estate broker Wayne Duddleston and banker [[Billy Goldberg]], bought the franchise for $5.6 million, and moved the team to Houston.<ref name="chronhistory"/> The franchise became the first NBA team in Texas,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonhistory.com/decades/history5q.htm|title=Booming Economy|publisher=houstonhistory.com|accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref> and the team's nickname of "Rockets" took on even greater relevance after the move.<ref>Houston, whose nickname is "Space City" has been home to the [[Lyndon B.

===1970s===
Because the Rockets did not have their own arena in Houston, they were playing their first two years at various venues in Houston, including the [[Astrodome]], [[Reliant Park|AstroHall]], and [[Hofheinz Pavilion]]. They also had to play "home" game in other cities such as [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], and even [[San Diego]].<ref name="chronhistory"/> During their first season, the Rockets averaged less than 5,000 fans per game, and in one game in Waco, there were only 759 fans in attendance.<ref name="chronhistory"/>

Before the start of the [[1971-72 NBA season]], Hannum left for the [[Denver Nuggets]] of the [[American Basketball Association]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/coaches/hannual01c.html|title=Alex Hannum Coaching Record|publisher=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=2008-05-14}}</ref> and [[Tex Winter]] was hired in his place.<ref name="winterrecord">{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/coaches/wintete99c.html|title=Tex Winter Coaching Record|publisher=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=2008-05-14}}</ref> However, Winter, who said that Hayes had "the worst fundamentals of any player" he had ever coached,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/rosen/021009.html|title=True tales from the camp fires|last=Rosen|first=Charley|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2008-05-14}}</ref> applied a system that contrasted with the offensive style to which Hayes was accustomed.

At the beginning of the [[1975-76 NBA season]], the Rockets moved into their new arena, [[Lakewood Church Central Campus|The Summit]], where they won their first game 104-89 over the [[Milwaukee Bucks]].<ref name="dateincompaq">{{cite news|url=http://www.nba.com/rockets/news/This_Date_In_Compaq_Center_His-57797-34.html|title=This Date In Compaq Center History|publisher=nba.com|accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref>  Under Egan's guidance, and as Tomjanovich, Murphy, and [[Mike Newlin]] led the way, the Rockets continued on to finish over .500 for the first time in franchise history, and they made their first appearance in [[1975 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] since arriving in Houston.<ref name="houstonindex"/> The Rockets defeated the [[New York Knicks]], who were led by [[Walt Frazier]] and [[Earl Monroe]] in a three-game mini-series in the first round, but lost to the [[Boston Celtics]] 4-2 in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] semi-finals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/HOU/1975.html|title=1974-75 Houston Rockets|publisher=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref>

At the start of the [[1976-77 NBA season|1976&ndash;77 season]], the Rockets negotiated a trade with the [[Buffalo Braves]] to acquire [[Moses Malone]],<ref name="malonebio">{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/malonem_bio.html|title=Moses Malone Bio|publisher=NBA.com|accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref> who had previously become the first player to go straight from the high school to the professional level.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://inside.nikebasketball.com/news/2006/11/17/force-stories-moses-malone/|title=Force Stories: Moses Malone|date=[[November 17]], [[2006]]|publisher=NikeBasketball.com|accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref> After Malone led the Rockets in rebounding for the first of six straight times,<ref name="houstonindex"/> and established a then-NBA record for offensive rebounds in a season,<ref name="malonebio"/> the Rockets posted a franchise-best 49&nbsp;wins and finished on top of the Central Division. In the [[1977 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]], Houston defeated the [[Washington Wizards|Washington Bullets]] in six games in the Eastern Conference semi-finals, and advanced to the conference finals for the first time in their history, but they lost to the top-seeded [[Philadelphia 76ers]] 4-2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/HOU/1977.html|title=1976-77 Houston Rockets|publisher=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=2008-05-15}}</ref>

Early into [[1977-78 NBA season|1977-78 season]], at a game on December 9, 1977, [[Kevin Kunnert]] got into a fight with [[Kermit Washington]] of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. As Tomjanovich approached the altercation, Washington turned and threw a punch that landed squarely in the face of an approaching Tomjanovich, causing numerous fractures in his face.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1093209/1/index.htm|title=Shattered And Shaken|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Curry |date=[[January 2]], [[1978]]|publisher=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref> Tomjanovich spent the next five months in rehabilitation and returned to appear in the 1978 All-Star Game, but his averages significantly declined after the injury,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/ccovtue.htm|title=New start from old wounds|last=Moore|first=David Leon|date=[[November 26]], [[2002]]|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref> and Houston finished with just 28&nbsp;wins in the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/HOU/1978.html|title=1977-78 Houston Rockets|publisher=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref>
