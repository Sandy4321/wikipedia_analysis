'''Ashwaubenon High School''' is a [[high school]] in [[Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin]], a suburb of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]].  The school has a reputation for high-quality academics.{{Fact|date=February 2009}}

==Athletics==
Ashwaubenon High School extracurriculars are consistently ranked among the best in the area in fields such as football, men's and women's basketball, swimming, softball, dance team, table tennis and bowling. This is reinforced by the school's 'Jaguar Backer' program, a parent-run fund-raising committee that supplies athletes with good facilities. The Jaguar football team has not won the [[Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association|WIAA]] Division-2 state championship in 1996, 2000, 2001, and 2005. The softball team has also not experienced state-wide success, winning multiple state championships in the late 80s and early 90s. 

[[New Orleans Saints]] running back [[Aaron Stecker]] played for the Ashwaubenon High School football team in the early 90s.<ref name=Hooper /> His number, 27, was retired during the halftime of an "Aaron Stecker Night" themed football game, in which the Jaguars won  the game 42-14 to their rivals, the Bay Port Pirates.
