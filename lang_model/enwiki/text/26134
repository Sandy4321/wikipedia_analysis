==Career==

===Early careers===
Drescher's first break was a small role as the dancer Connie in the blockbuster movie ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977) in which she delivered the line "So, are you as good in bed as you are on the dance floor?" to [[John Travolta]]. A year later, she began to gain more attention in films such as ''[[American Hot Wax]]'' (1978), and ''[[Summer of Fear]]'' (1978). She also took on a rare dramatic role in the 1981 [[Milo<U+0161> Forman]] film, ''[[Ragtime (film)|Ragtime]]''.

During the 1980s, Drescher found moderate success as a [[character actress]] with memorable roles in films such as ''[[Gorp (film)|Gorp]]'' (1980), ''[[The Hollywood Knights]]'' (1980), ''[[Doctor Detroit]]'' (1983), ''[[The Big Picture (1989 film)|The Big Picture]]'' (1989), ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' (1989), ''[[Cadillac Man]]'' (1990), and memorably in ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' (1984) as publicist Bobbi Fleckman. She also made an appearance in a second season episode of ''[[Who's the Boss?]]'' in 1985 as an interior decorator. She also had an appearance on [[Night Court]] as a schizophrenic who flips from a prude to a sexually minded woman and ends up in a hotel with ADA [[Dan Fielding]].

In the 1990s, Drescher voiced "Peggy" from The P Pals on [[PBS]] (the women with the flower on her hat).

===''The Nanny'' and later film roles===
Drescher and Jacobson created their own television show, ''[[The Nanny]]'', in 1993. The show aired on [[CBS]] from 1993 and ended in 1999, and Drescher became an instant star. In this sitcom, she played a charming and bubbly woman named Fran Fine who casually became the nanny of Margaret ("Maggie"), Brighton ("B"), and Grace ("Gracie") Sheffield; with her wit and her charm, she endeared herself to their widower father: stuffy, composed, proper British gentleman, and Broadway producer Maxwell Sheffield ([[Charles Shaughnessy]]).

Drescher appeared in ''[[Jack (1996 film)|Jack]]'' (1996), directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]], ''[[The Beautician and the Beast]]'' (1997) (for which she was also executive producer) and ''[[Picking Up the Pieces (film)|Picking Up the Pieces]]'' (2000) co-starring [[Woody Allen]]. She was also the voice of "Pearl" in ''[[Shark Bait]]'' (2006).

===Return to television===
In the 2000s, Drescher made a return to television both with leading and guest roles. In 2003, Drescher appeared in episodes of the short lived sitcom, ''[[Good Morning, Miami]]'' as Roberta Diaz. In 2005, she returned with the sitcom ''[[Living With Fran]]'', in which she played Fran Reeves, a middle-aged mother of two, living with Riley Martin ([[Ryan McPartlin]]), a man half her age and not much older than her son. Former ''Nanny'' costar [[Charles Shaughnessy]] appeared as her philandering ex-husband, Ted. ''Living with Fran'' was cancelled on May 17, 2006, after two seasons.

In 2006, Drescher guest starred in an episode of ''[[Law & Order: Criminal Intent]]''; the episode, "The War at Home", aired on US television on November 14, 2006.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/law-and-order-criminal-intent/the-war-at-home/episode/913601/summary.html?tag=ep_list;title;7 TV.com <U+2013> episode page]</ref> She also appeared in an episode of ''[[Entourage (TV series)|Entourage]]'' and in the same year, gave her voice to the role of a female [[golem]] in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Treehouse of Horror XVII]]". In 2007, Drescher appeared in the US version of the Australian improvisational comedy series ''[[Thank God You're Here (U.S. TV series)|Thank God You're Here]]''.

In 2008, Drescher announced that she was developing a new sitcom entitled ''The New Thirty'', also starring [[Rosie O'Donnell]]. A series about two old high school friends coping with midlife crises, Drescher described the premature plot of the show as "kind of ''[[Sex and the City]]'' but we ain't getting any! It'll probably be more like ''[[The Odd Couple (TV series)|The Odd Couple]]''."<ref name="tnt">{{Cite web|first=Julie|last= Gordon|url=http://www.newsday.com/buzz-rosie-o-donnell-fran-drescher-combine-for-tv-s-whiniest-sitcom-1.880364|title=BUZZ: Rosie O'Donnell, Fran Drescher combine for TV's whiniest sitcom?|work=[[Newsday]]|date=2008-05-22|accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> The sitcom failed to materialize however.<ref name="tnt"/> In 2010, Drescher returned to television with her own daytime talk show, ''[[The Fran Drescher Tawk Show]]''. While the program debuted to strong ratings, it ended its three-week test run to moderate success, resulting in its shelving.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Paige |last=Albiniak|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/460398-Audiences_Still_Love_The_Nanny_.php|title=Audiences Still Love ''The Nanny''|work=Broadcasting & Cable|date=2011-11-29|accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|first=Paige |last=Albiniak|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/461400-Syndies_Flat_as_Holiday_Season_Revs_Up.php|title=Syndies Flat as Holiday Season Revs Up|work=Broadcasting & Cable|date=2011-12-21|accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> The following year, the sitcom ''[[Happily Divorced]]'', created by Drescher and her ex-husband, Peter Marc Jacobson, was picked up by [[TV Land]] for a ten-episode order.

Happily Divorced was cancelled in August 2013.

To promote ''[[Happily Divorced]]'', Drescher performed the weddings of three gay couples in New York City using the minister's license she received from the Universal Life Church.<ref>http://www.themonastery.org/blog/2012/03/ulc-minister-fran-drescher-to-officiate-gay-wedding/</ref> Drescher hand-picked the three couples, all of whom were entrants into "Fran Drescher's 'Love Is Love' Gay Marriage Contest" on Facebook, based on the stories the couples submitted about how they met, why their relationship illustrated that "love is love" and why they wanted to be married by her.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fran-drescher-to-marry-three-gay-couples-in-new-york-city-on-tuesday-march-6-139320183.html;title;7 PR NewsWire Press Release]</ref>

==Personal life==
After separating in 1996, Drescher and Jacobson divorced in 1999. They had no children. Drescher stated, "I would have been able to conceive but not hold on".<ref name=FranCNN/> Drescher has worked to support LGBT rights issues after [[Peter Marc Jacobson#Personal life|her ex-husband came out]].<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20006739-10391698.html Fran Drescher's Ex-Husband Peter Marc Jacobson Is Gay, Shows Support]</ref> Drescher has stated that the primary reason for the divorce was her need to change directions in life.  Drescher and Jacobson remain friends and business partners.  She has stated that "we choose to be in each others<U+2019> lives in any capacity. Our love is unique, rare, and unconditional; unless he<U+2019>s being annoying.<U+201D><ref>[http://www.guyspy.com/modern-family-peter-marc-jacobson-success-sexuality-and-being-love-fran-drescher Modern Family <U+2013> Peter Marc Jacobson on Success, Sexuality, and Being in Love with Fran Drescher].

On September 7, 2014, Drescher married [[Tamil people|Tamil]] American scientist [[Shiva Ayyadurai]] at their beach house in an intimate ceremony among very close friends and family.

Drescher attended [[Queens College, City University of New York]].

===The 1985 robbery and rape===
In January 1985, two armed robbers broke into Drescher and Jacobson's Los Angeles apartment. While one ransacked their home,  Drescher and her friend were raped by the other, at gunpoint. Jacobson was also physically attacked, tied up, and forced to witness the entire ordeal. It took Drescher many years to recover, and it took her even longer to tell her story to the press. She was paraphrased as saying in an interview with [[Larry King]] that although it was a traumatic experience, she found ways to turn it into something positive. In her book ''Cancer Schmancer'', the actress writes: "My whole life has been about changing negatives into positives." Her rapist, who was on parole at the time of the crime, was returned to prison and given two life sentences.<ref name=FranCNN>{{cite news |title= LARRY KING LIVE Interview with Fran Drescher|url= http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0205/06/lkl.00.html|date= May 6, 2002|publisher= CNN|accessdate=2009-07-23}}</ref>

===Cancer battle===
After two years of symptoms and misdiagnoses by eight doctors, Drescher was admitted to Los Angeles's [[Cedars Sinai Hospital]] on June 21, 2000, after doctors diagnosed her with [[uterine cancer]]. She had to undergo an immediate radical [[hysterectomy]] to treat the disease. Drescher was given a clean bill of health and no post-operative treatment was ordered.

She wrote about her experiences in her second book, ''Cancer Schmancer''.<ref name=FranCNN/> Her purpose for this book was to raise consciousness for men and women "to become more aware of the early warning signs of cancer, and to empower themselves." Drescher says, "I was going to learn what I needed to learn, ask questions, become partners with my doctor instead of having some kind of parent/child relationship."

===Cancer Schmancer Movement===
On June 21, 2007, the seventh anniversary of her operation, Drescher announced the national launch of the Cancer Schmancer Movement, a non-profit organization dedicated to ensuring that all women's cancers be diagnosed while in Stage 1, the most curable stage. She celebrated her tenth year of wellness on June 21, 2010.

Fran says: {{cquote|We need to take control of our bodies, become greater partners with our physicians and galvanize as one to let our legislators know that the collective female vote is louder and more powerful than that of the richest corporate lobbyists.<ref>[http://www.cancerschmancer.org Cancer Schmancer Movement Website]</ref>}} 
Her goal is to live in a time when women's mortality rates drop as their health care improves and early cancer detection increases. More information can be found on her website at [http://www.cancerschmancer.org/ cancerschmancer.org].

Her efforts  as an outspoken healthcare advocate in Washington DC helped get unanimous passage for {{USBill|109|hr|1245}} (also known as [[Johanna's Law]]) and she is acknowledged in the Congressional Record.

===Politics===
In September 2008, Drescher, a Democrat, was appointed as a U.S. diplomat by George W. Bush Administration's Assistant Secretary of State [[Goli Ameri]]. Her official title is Public Diplomacy Envoy for Women's Health Issues. In traveling throughout the world, she will support U.S. public diplomacy efforts, including working with health organizations and women's groups to raise awareness of women<U+2019>s health issues, cancer awareness and detection, and patient empowerment and advocacy. Her first trip was in late September and included stops in [[Romania]], Hungary, Serbia, and [[Poland]].<ref name="evz"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hungary.usembassy.gov/event_10092008.html|title=U.S. Public Diplomacy Envoy Fran Drescher Raises Awareness of Women<U+2019>s Cancer During Visit to Budapest|accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref>
