'''Jumbo King''' is a chain of fast food restaurants based primarily in [[Mumbai]], specialising in the [[Maharashtra|Maharashtrian]] regional dish [[vada pav]]. Established in 2001 by husband and wife Dheeraj and Reeta Gupta, the company was inspired by the fast food business model of [[McDonald's]] and [[Burger King]].<ref name=rediff1/><ref>{{cite web|title=The Story of Jumbo Vada Pav|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/the-story-jumbo-vada-pav-2311709.html?cat=3|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|accessdate=28 April 2012|date=12 December 2008}}</ref> Jumbo King Foods Pvt. Ltd is a [[franchisee]]-based company that operates across many areas of India. From its beginnings in [[Malad]], a suburb of Mumbai, it has spread across the whole [[Mumbai Metropolitan Region]] (MMR), as well as [[Bangalore]], [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] and [[Gujarat]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />

==History==
An earlier franchisee of [[Burger King]], the Guptas, on their visit to London, realised that fast food could also work in India. Vada pav was the their first idea, as the food had to be portable.<ref name=et2004>{{cite news|title=The magic of vada pav|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/874543.cms|accessdate=28 April 2012|newspaper=[[The Economic Times]]|date=6 October 2004}}</ref> In 2001 the Guptas opened their first restaurant at [[Malad]], with an initial investment of {{INRConvert|200000}}, which they borrowed from his family. The outlet was initially named [[Chaat]] Factory (Snack Factory), and vada pav was sold at {{Indian Rupee|link=Indian rupee}}5, despite street vendors selling the same product for {{Indian Rupee|link=Indian rupee}}2. The name was later changed to Jumbo King. Gupta faced opposition from his family, who thought he was wasting his [[MBA]] by selling vada pavs.<ref name=rediff1>{{cite web|title=Dheeraj Gupta: The vendor of vadas|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/2004/oct/30spec2.htm|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]|date=30 October 2004|accessdate=28 April 2012}}</ref>

[[Vada pav]] is a popular vegetarian dish native to the Indian state of [[Maharashtra]], although it has been losing its reputation in past few years. The places where the food is now cooked and sold are often polluted, and it is considered a "poor man's food".<ref name=asiaone>{{cite web|url=http://business.asiaone.com/Business/SME%2BCentral/Brand%2BMe%2521/Story/A1Story20080922-89272.html|title=Mumbai takes on McDonald's with veggie street food|publisher=[[AsiaOne]]|date=22 September 2008|accessdate=28 April 2012|author=AFP}}</ref> The people of Mumbai and [[Thane]] consume about 18<U+2013>lakh (1.8<U+2013>2 million) units of vada pav, with stiff competition mainly from the unhygienic street vendors in the city. In contrast, Jumbo King cooks and sells the food in hygienic conditions.<ref>{{cite web|title=The amazing story of vada pav chain Jumbo King|url=http://business.rediff.com/slide-show/2010/aug/27/slide-show-1-special-the-amazing-story-of-vada-pav-chain-jumbo-king.htm|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]|date=27 August 2010|accessdate=28 April 2012}}</ref>

As of 2010, the chain had 30 outlets in Mumbai, selling an average of 40,000 vada pavs everyday, priced between {{INR}}8 and {{INR}}16 apiece.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fast food chain Jumbo King plans 500 outlets by March 2010|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/todays-paper/tp-marketing/article1667016.ece?ref=archive|accessdate=28 April 2012|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=21 August 2007}}</ref>
