At the 49th [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]]'s general conference, Michelle Obama encouraged the attendees to advocate for political awareness, saying "To anyone who says that church is no place to talk about these issues, you tell them there is no place better&nbsp;<U+2013> no place better, because ultimately, these are not just political issues&nbsp;<U+2013> they are moral issues, they're issues that have to do with human dignity and human potential, and the future we want for our kids and our grandkids."<ref>{{cite press release|last=Obama|first=Michelle|title=Remarks by the First Lady at the African Methodist Episcopal Church Conference|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/28/remarks-first-lady-african-methodist-episcopal-church-conference|publisher=The White House|accessdate=February 22, 2013}}</ref>

==Early campaigns==

Although Obama has campaigned on her husband's behalf since early in his political career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not relish the activity at first. When she campaigned during [[Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama#Campaign for Bobby Rush's congressional seat|her husband's 2000 run]] for [[United States House of Representatives]], her boss at the University of Chicago asked if there was any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new [[Interior decoration|decorating]] ideas.<ref name="NYT0825">{{cite news | author=Kantor, Jodi | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/26/us/politics/26michelle.html?scp=2&sq=Michelle%20Obama&st=cse |title=Michelle Obama, reluctant no more |work=The New York Times |date=August 25, 2008 |accessdate=August 27, 2008}}</ref>

===LGBT rights===
[[File:Michelle Obama official portrait.jpg|thumb|Obama's first term official portrait]]
Both Michelle Obama and her husband have been committed advocates of [[LGBT]] rights. In the 2008 US presidential election, Michelle boasted, to gay Democrat groups, of her husband's record on LGBT rights. She was proud of his cosponsorship of a bill amending the [[Illinois Human Rights Act]] to protect LGBT people by prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in the workplace, housing, and all public places. Together they support many issues which he has acted upon politically including his support for the following: the Illinois gender violence act, the [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]], repealing [[Don't Ask Don't Tell]], full repeal of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], [[civil unions]], hate crimes protection for sexual orientation and gender identity and renewed effort to fight HIV and AIDS. They have both been opponents of constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage in the [[Federal Marriage Amendment|federal]], [[Proposition 8|California]], and [[Florida Amendment 2|Florida]] constitutions. She said that the US Supreme Court delivered justice in the ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' case and drew a connection between the struggles for gay rights and civil rights by stating "We are all only here because of those who marched and bled and died, from Selma to Stonewall, in the pursuit of a more perfect union."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/talesfromthetrail/2008/06/26/michelle-obama-speaks-to-gay-democrats/|title=Michelle Obama speaks to gay Democrats|accessdate=January 22, 2013|date=June 27, 2008|work=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/2008/06/the-audacity-of-hope-from-selm.php|title=The audacity of hope <U+2013> 'from Selma to Stonewall{{'-}}|accessdate=January 22, 2013|date=June 27, 2008|work=TMP|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307001621/http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/2008/06/the-audacity-of-hope-from-selm.php|archivedate=March 7, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.towleroad.com/2008/08/michelle-obama.html|title=Michelle Obama Speaks to LGBT Delegates at Convention Lunch|accessdate=January 22, 2013|date=August 27, 2008|work=Towleroad}}</ref>
