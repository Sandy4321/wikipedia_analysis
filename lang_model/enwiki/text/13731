==Plot==
Due to a tragic childhood accident, Emily Gilmore ([[Yasmine Bleeth]]) is left scarred both physically and mentally. The large scar on her face is a constant reminder to Emily that her career and love life are suffering. Lonely yet talented, Emily longs for a successful career and romance but is trapped by insecurity and fear.

The handsome Alec Dalton ([[James Wilder (actor)|James Wilder]]) turns Emily's life around and makes her feel truly happy and secure for the first time in her life.  Unfortunately, Alec talks Emily into stealing money from her employer. But the old man that Emily works for comes in during the heist and has a heart attack. Emily stays behind to help him while Alec runs off. He gets away with the money but Emily is sent to prison. She is so in love with Alec she does not say a word about Alec's involvement. 

While Emily is in prison she learns that Alec has run away with her own sister, Sheila Gilmore ([[Chandra West]]). Devastated, Emily gets in a fight with another inmate and because of the injuries she sustains she has to be seen by Dr. Matthew Sheridan ([[Richard Beymer]]). The doctor tells her that he can correct her scars for free with an experimental surgery. It's a great success and Emily is beautiful, almost unrecognizable. After the surgery Emily begins a relationship with the surgeon, who showers her in gifts and love. The two get engaged, but Emily leaves him when she discovers that Matthew had reconstructed her face to be identical to his dead wife's.

Emily attempts to begin again, changing her name and starting her own business as a fashion designer with her friend Claudia ([[Robin Givens]]). She reconnects with a kind man from her past, Paul ([[Ricky Paull Goldin]]), and starts a relationship with him (though he does not know her true identity.) But when Emily runs into Alec and he does not recognize her, she decides to take her revenge.
