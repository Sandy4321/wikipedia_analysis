Based on its most recent reported results, the assets acquired generated, for the year ended 31 March 2012, annual revenues of <U+00A3>39 million and delivered operating profit margins similar to those of the rest of the Ricardo group.

==AEA Technology==
'''AEA Technology plc''' was formed in 1996 as the privatised offshoot of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]]. It was a constituent of the [[FTSE Fledgling Index]]. Originally it consisted of divisions with expertise in a wide variety of areas, mostly the products of nuclear-related research. These included [[nuclear safety]], [[nuclear engineering]], [[environmental protection]], battery technology and non-destructive testing. It mainly acted as a contractor organisation for UKAEA and other governmental and private customers.

AEA Technology was an energy & environmental consultancy business.  The company divested all of the nuclear-related elements of the business and other non-core businesses such as its Rail business (now called [[DeltaRail Group|DeltaRail Group Ltd]]) through two portfolio sales to [[secondary private equity]] investment firms in September 2005 and in September 2006 respectively.<ref>[http://www.collercapital.com/assets/html/pressrelease.html?ID=65 AEA Technology: asset sale]</ref> In addition to environmental consultancy the company also works in the Knowledge Transfer <ref>[http://www.aeat.co.uk/ip_innovation_kt.htm AEA Knowledge Transfer]</ref> and Programme Management areas. The business is organised around a mesh style "communities" structure which includes Knowledge Leadership (key technical consultant), Project Management, IT,<ref>[http://www.aeat.co.uk/fp_it.htm AEA IT]</ref> Marketing and Sales.

The company's main UK operations are located at the [[Harwell Science and Innovation Campus]] in [[Oxfordshire]] (head office), [[London]], [[Risley, Warrington|Risley]] and [[Glasgow]] (Scotland). In August 2006, AEA established a Romania Subsidiary in Bucharest (AEA Mediu) and this was shut down in April 2009.<ref>[http://www.aeat.co.uk/mediu_eng.htm AEA Mediu website]</ref>
