'''Catherine Leigh "Cat" Osterman''' (born April 16, 1983), is an [[United States|American]] athlete and was one of the pitchers on the USA Women's Softball Team which won the gold medal at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] and the silver medal in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].
She started playing [[softball]] in first grade before quitting to play [[soccer]] and [[basketball]]. Cat found her way back to the diamond in fifth grade, when she was filling in as a backup pitcher for a little league team.  She completed her collegiate eligibility in 2006 at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where she was a starting [[pitcher]] for the [[Texas Longhorn Athletics|Longhorns]] since 2002. 

Osterman held the [[NCAA Softball Championship|NCAA Division I]] career [[strikeout]] record with 2,265 strikeouts over her four year career, surpassed by [[Monica Abbott]] on May 6, 2007. Cat is still the NCAA all-time leader for strikeouts per 7 innings, 14.34, as she pitched far fewer innings than Abbott (343 less).  Cat also holds the Big 12 record with 25 Pitcher of the Week awards and the Big 12 record with four Pitcher of the Year awards. Osterman pitched a total of 20 NCAA career [[no-hitter]]s and 10 NCAA career [[perfect game]]s.

==Early life and high school==
Osterman was born in [[Houston, Texas]] to parents Gary and Laura Osterman. Her younger brothers are Craig (born 1986) and Chris (born 1994). She attended [[Cypress Springs High School]] in [[Cypress, Texas]] from 1997 to 2001, where she set several records on the school's softball team.

In 2001, she struck out 33 batters in a 14-inning 1-0 shutout over [[Cy-Fair High School]]. The performance ranked 16th on the strikeouts-in-a-single-game (extra innings) list, behind:

*61, [[Alicia Hollowell]]; Fairfield Middle School 0, Woodland High School 1; May 25 & 29, 2001; 30 innings

As such, she set a national record for strikeouts in a game under 20 innings, beating Jenny Stallard's previous record of 31 in 19 innings in 1978; she also set a national record for strikeouts in a 14-inning game, breaking Michelle Granger's former record of 31 in 1985.

== University of Texas: Freshman and Sophomore years ==
===2002: Freshman year===
Osterman became the first UT freshman to be named [[Big 12 Conference]] Pitcher of the Week, for the week of February 19, a week in which she threw two no-hitters (a 3-0 win over the [[University of Utah]] on February 13 and a 4-0 win over Southwest Texas on February 15); they were only the third and fourth no-hitters by a UT freshman, and Cat became only the second Longhorns pitcher to throw a no-hitter, along with Natalie King's two freshman no-hitters in 2001).  Her February 13 no-hitter was the first of her NCAA career.

She also threw the first [[perfect game]] in UT history in a game against [[Stephen F. Austin State University]] on February 26; she proceeded to throw two more perfect games in her freshman season.  She struck out 554 batters to set an NCAA freshman record (which has since been eclipsed by Monica Abbott of the [[University of Tennessee|Tennessee Volunteers]] with 582 in 2004).

She set UT single-season records for wins (36), innings pitched (304<U+2153>), games started (40), [[shutouts]] (17), appearances (51), and consecutive innings without giving up an earned-[[Softball#Scoring runs|run]] (79<U+2154> from February 13 to March 13), as well as the UT single-game record for innings-pitched (14) and strikeouts-in-a-game (23) in a March 1 game against [[Mississippi State University]]. In a March 20 game against [[Texas State University|Texas State]], she broke her own UT record for strikeouts-in-a-game with 24 in a 12-inning match. She also tied the UT single-season record for complete games (27)..

===2003: Sophomore year===
Osterman threw four more no-hitters, including another perfect game<U+2014>on February 12, March 1, and March 20<U+2014>while setting new UT career records for wins (68), shutouts (35), strikeouts (1,042), and opponents-batting-average (.105).  She is so far the only pitcher in [[Big 12 Conference]] history to strike out 1,000 batters in only two seasons.  She also broke the record for strikeouts-per-game with an average of 14.1 per seven-innings, beating the previous mark of 13.9 by Danielle Henderson of the [[University of Massachusetts]] in 1999; she surpassed her own UT single-season record for shutouts with 18, and tied her own shared record for complete games (27).  From April 22 to May 22, she went a career-high and UT record 65 consecutive scoreless-innings.

On July 11, Osterman threw a no-hitter in the [http://www.usasoftball.com/Women/Canadacup/03CanadaCup/2003anadacupusschedule.html 2003 Canada Cup], striking out 10 batters to defeat Team Canada 8-0; on July 12, Osterman pitched her second no-hitter of the 2003 Canada Cup, striking out 16 of 24 batters to defeat the Stratford Brakettes 5-0.

On August 15, Osterman threw a perfect game to win [http://www.usasoftball.com/Women/Panam/03PanAms/03PanAmsboxscores/gam54.htm the Gold-Medal game] of the 2003 [[Pan American Games]] against Canada 4-0, securing Team USA's fifth consecutive PanAm Gold Medal.  She struck out 14 batters in a game that was delayed three-and-a-half hours due to rain.

==2004: XXVIII Olympiad==
Osterman redshirted from UT to participate with fellow college softball pitcher [[Jennie Finch]] in the [[Softball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in Athens.

===Aiming for Athens===
Osterman went undefeated in 24 appearances during the USA Softball National Team's 53-game schedule. On February 20, she struck out nine batters in four perfect innings and combined with Finch for a no-hitter. On May 17, she struck out seven of nine batters over three innings, after which Finch struck out the final six batters in a row to combine for a perfect game and defeat the Sonic Stars 10-0. On July 10, she struck out 13 batters over five innings for another no-hitter, this time missing perfection on a lone error by first-baseman [[Stacey Nuveman]] in a 16-0 win over the Fort Worth All-Stars.

===Olympic Games===
Osterman picked up two wins and a save in the Olympiad.  She followed Finch and Lori Harrigan of the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] by striking out the final two batters in Team USA's 7-0 victory over Italy on August 14; she gave up one hit and struck out 11 batters over eight innings in Team USA's 3-0 victory over Japan on August 16; and she gave up one hit and four walks while striking out 10 batters over six innings in Team USA's 3-0 victory over Chinese Taipei on August 20.

She also topped her previous UT single-season records for complete games (31) and shutouts (22), and broke her own NCAA single-season record for strikeouts-per-game with an average of 15.2 per seven innings.  She tied her own UT records for strikeouts-in-a-game with 24 (April 26) and strikeouts-in-a-seven-inning-game with 19 (May 1), and finished the season at third place on the all-time NCAA single-season strikeout list with 593 (behind [[Courtney Blades]]'s 663 in 2000, and [[Monica Abbott]]'s 603 in 2005).

On June 12, Osterman picked up the win in Team USA's [http://www.usasoftball.com/women/2005InternationalSportsInvitational/Box%20Scores/game10.htm Gold-Medal 9-0 victory] over Australia in the [http://www.usasoftball.com/women/2005InternationalSportsInvitational/homepage.html 2005 International Sports Invitational]; she gave up one hit and struck out ten batters over five innings.

On August 20, Osterman earned a save &mdash; her first for Team USA since the Athens Olympics &mdash; in a nine-inning [[Softball at the 2008 Summer Olympics#Semifinals|4-1 win]] over Japan.  She inherited a runner from Abbott before retiring three batters for a perfect ninth to preserve the victory and advance to the [[Softball at the 2008 Summer Olympics#Gold Medal Match|Gold Medal Match]], where Team USA faced Japan once again following Japan's 12-inning 4-3 win over Australia in the [[Softball at the 2008 Summer Olympics#Bronze medal match|Bronze Medal Match]].

On August 21, Osterman pitched the first five innings of a [[Softball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|3-1 loss]] to Japan in the [[Softball at the 2008 Summer Olympics#Gold Medal Match|Gold Medal Match]], ending Team USA's winning streak at 22 consecutive games and clinching the silver medal of the 2008 Summer Games.  The loss was Team USA's first since a 2-1 loss to Australia on [[Softball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|21 September 2000]], and marks the first time in four Olympiads that the US National Team has failed to win the gold.  Osterman gave up two runs on three hits while striking out nine batters; the runs and the loss were the first in her Olympic career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nowpublic.com/world/womans-softball-japan-upsets-usa-3-1 |title=Womans Softball, Japan Upsets USA 3-1 |publisher=Nowpublic.com |date=2008-08-21 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}</ref>
