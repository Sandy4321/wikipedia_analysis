"'''Suga Mama'''" is a song by American [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]]. It was written by Knowles, [[Rich Harrison]], and Makeba; Harrison and Knowles produced the track for her second solo album, ''[[B'Day]]''. It contains a [[sampling (music)|sample]] of [[Jake Wade and the Soul Searchers]]' song "Searching for Soul", which was written by [[Chuck Middleton]]. The song is influenced by 1970s [[funk]] and contains limited elements of 1980s [[go-go]], with sound that closely resembles live music.

The [[music video]] for the song was released in April 2007 on British television. Critical reviews of the song were generally positive.

==Recording, music and theme==
Knowles enlisted Harrison as one of the five co-producers of ''B'Day'', and she arranged for him, [[Sean Garrett]] and [[Rodney Jerkins]] to be given individual rooms at [[Sony Music Studios]] in [[New York City]]. Knowles said she fostered "healthy competition" between the producers by going into each of their rooms and commenting on the "great beats" the others were creating.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-09-11|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003087041|title=It's A Celebration |work=Billboard|date=2006-09-04 }}</ref> She and Harrison had previously collaborated on her 2003 single "[[Crazy in Love (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles song)|Crazy in Love]]", which uses a prominent [[soul music]] sample in a similar manner to "Suga Mama".<ref name=FOXNews/> [[Fox News]] said that "Suga Mama" and "Freakum Dress", Harrison's other contribution to ''B'Day'' "fall short of originality but mimic the [[The Chi-Lites|Chi Lites]]{{sic}} percussion section [of "Crazy in Love"] yet again", adding, "Harrison is like the [[Indiana Jones]] of soul, constantly pulling out forgotten gems of the past for sampling [...] You can't help but think: Thank God someone wrote music in the past that can be repurposed now."<ref name=FOXNews>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-09-11|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,208884,00.html|title=First Look: Beyonce's New Album 'B'Day' |publisher=FOX|date=2006-08-17|author=Friedman, Roger }}</ref>

==Reception==
The ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote that "Suga Mama" was the "best moment" on ''B'Day'', which it reviewed negatively, and that it "owes much of its charm to lifts from Jake Wade and the Soul Searchers".<ref>{{cite web|author=DeRogatis, Jim|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20060903/ai_n16710505|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071023221412/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20060903/ai_n16710505|archivedate=2007-10-23|title=Spins - Beyonce, "B'day" (Sony)|publisher=''Chicago Sun-Times''|date=2006-09-03|accessdate=2008-09-11}}</ref> According to a review of ''B'Day'' in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', "A piddly home [[hi-fi]] can hardly capture the thunderous grandeur of '[[Get Me Bodied]]' [...] or 'Suga Mama', a funky update of gutbucket '60s soul. Those songs showcase Beyonce's virtuosity, her mix of brute power and slick syncopation."<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-31|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1516025,00.html|title=B'Day (2006) |work=Entertainment Weekly|author=Rosen, Jody }}</ref> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said Rich Harrison "delivers again with 'Suga Mama', twisting a vintage Soul Searchers sample into a gritty, loping groove. Beyonce sounds right at home on this one [...] And while it doesn't quite eclipse 'Crazy in Love', it's still ''B'Day'''s finest moment."<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-09-11|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/05/AR2006090501475.html|title=Beyonce's 'B'Day' Is Nothing to Celebrate |work=The Washington Post|date=2006-09-06|author=Richards, Chris }}</ref>

''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' cited the song as an example of one of the "good moments" on ''B'Day'' being "followed by a dud [...] the slinky funk of 'Suga Mama' is trodden on by the mechanical '[[Upgrade U]]' and then trampled by the posturing and eventually annoying '[[Ring the Alarm]]'".<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-09-11|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/cd-reviews/bday/2006/09/08/1157222307561.html|title=B'Day |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=2006-09-08|author=Zuel, Bernard }}</ref> [[IGN Music]] criticized Knowles' vocals in the song, writing that she "comes in over the low-end track with too much earnestness, drowning out the funky grooves with her piercing dramatic [[mezzo-soprano]]. If she were a throaty [[alto]], she'd fit the beats that have been served up to her much more appropriately."<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-09-11|url=http://uk.music.ign.com/articles/730/730624p1.html|title=Beyonce - B'Day |publisher=IGN|date=2006-09-05|author=D., Spence }}</ref>

"Suga Mama" was included on the set list of Knowles' 2007 tour, [[The Beyonc<U+00E9> Experience]], and ''[[The Tennessean]]'' wrote that the song "was even sexier and more gutbucket than on record".<ref>{{cite web|author=Friskics-Warren, Bill|url=http://www.beyonceworld.net/tour2007/Reviews/July18_Nashville/001.htm|title=Review: Beyonc<U+00E9> and her all-female band inspire, uplift|work=[[The Tennessean]]|date=2007-07-19|accessdate=2008-08-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071211162822/http://www.beyonceworld.net/tour2007/Reviews/July18_Nashville/001.htm |archivedate = December 11, 2007}}</ref> A remix of the song features rapper American hip hop artist [[Consequence (rapper)|Consequence]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-09-11|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003612292|title=Consequence Snags DMC For Video, Preps New CD |work=Billboard|date=2007-07-16|author=Concepcion, Mariel}}</ref>

==Music video and promotion==

The "Suga Mama" [[music video]] was released to British music channels in April 2007.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-09-11|url=http://www.b-day.co.uk/www/news_view.php?content_id=84|title=Suga Mama |publisher=RCA Records|date=2007-04-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012102612/http://b-day.co.uk/www/news_view.php?content_id=84 |archivedate = October 12, 2007}}</ref> It is [[black-and-white]] and was co-directed by [[Melina (director)|Melina]] and Knowles for the ''[[B'Day Anthology Video Album]]'', which was released the same month;<ref name=MTVNews-Apr2007/> it was one of eight videos shot in two weeks for the album.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-09-11|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2007-04-05-beyonce-video-album_N.htm|title=Beyonce releases 'B'Day' video album |work=USA Today|date=2007-04-05 }}</ref> It begins with Knowles sitting in a chair, wearing men's clothing and smoking a cigar. She gets up and begins to [[pole dance]]. The remainder of the video presents Knowles dancing on top of a sugar cube, dancing with backing dancers whose faces are partially concealed, lying in a circle of light, and riding a [[mechanical bull]]. Knowles said she is meant to "slowly become a woman" during the video, adding "Well, a sexier woman <U+2014> I'm always a woman."<ref name=MTVNews-Apr2007/>

Knowles rehearsed the pole dancing using two ballet bars, which was when it was decided to add a pole above her head to form an arc. Though Knowles is from [[Texas]], she had never previously been on mechanical bull. There were no problems during warm-ups, but the man operating the bull during the video shoot programmed it to go faster, causing Knowles to fall off when she tried to perform tricks such as lifting up her foot, leaning back and turning around. To minimize the time Knowles spent on the bull, the director shot the sequence at twelve [[film frame|frame]]s per second (see [[frame rate]]) and Knowles sang twice as quickly, but it wasn't until 4:00 am that they completed work.<ref name=MTVNews-Apr2007>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-31|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/b/beyonce/videos_07/news_feature_040207/index.jhtml|title=Behind the B'Day Videos |publisher=MTV|author=Vineyard, Jennifer }}</ref>
