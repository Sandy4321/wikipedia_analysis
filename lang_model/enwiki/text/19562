'''[[Australia at the Summer Olympics|Australia]]''' has competed in '''[[Swimming at the Summer Olympics]]''' since the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], after only sending a runner, [[Edwin Flack]] to the [[1896 Summer Olympics]]. [[Frederick Lane]] was Australia's sole swimming representative at the the 1900 games, winning two individual gold medals. Women's events were added at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]], with [[Fanny Durack]] and [[Mina Wylie]] being Australia's first female representatives, winning gold and silver in the 100m freestyle, which was the first women's event on the program. At the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] and the [[1912 Summer Olympics]], Australia competed as [[Australasia at the Summer Olympics|Australasia]], sending a combined team with [[New Zealand]]. The table includes [[Malcolm Champion]], a New Zealander who was part of the 4x200m freestyle relay team which captured gold in 1912.<ref name = "all">{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Malcolm|title=Australia at the Olympics|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] Books|year=2000|id= ISBN 0-7333-0884-8|pages=412-423}}</ref>

Australia has won a total of 52 gold medals in the sport, second only to the [[United States at the Summer Olympics|United States]], who have won 205, almost four times as many. [[East Germany at the Summer Olympics|East Germany]] is in third place with 32 golds, although this is widely attributed to state-sponsored systematic doping programs.<ref> {{cite news |first = |last = |title = Swimming's big splash

Swimming is Australia's most prolific Olympic sport, having been responsible for 52 of Australia's 129 Olympic gold medals. In addition, a list of the top 50 Australian Olympians of all time, compiled by the [[Australian Olympic Committee]], named eighteen swimmers in the top 50, more than any other sport. Swimmers have been given the honour of carrying the Australian flag five times in eleven at the closing ceremony, which is traditionally reserved for the most successful athlete of the delegation.<ref name="aoc50">{{cite web |url= http://www.olympics.com.au/index.cfm?p=25 |title= 50 Of Our Finest Overview|accessdate=2006-11-20 |format= |publisher= [[Australian Olympic Committee]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.olympics.com.au/index.cfm?p=22 |title= Games at a Glance|accessdate=2006-11-20 |format= |publisher= [[Australian Olympic Committee]]}}</ref>

Australia's strongest ever performance in swimming was at the [[Swimming at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Olympics]] on home soil in [[Melbourne]]. Australia claimed eight of the thirteen gold medals available, including both relays and a clean sweep of the medals in the 100m freestyle, considered the blue-riband event for both men and women. This is the only time that Australia has topped the medal tally in swimming, and the tally of gold medals has not been surpassed despite the expansion of the swimming program to its current 32 events.<ref name ="all"/>

Australia has been most successful in the [[freestyle swimming|freestyle]] discipline, with 36 of the 52 golds coming in the stroke. Eight of the gold have come from the men's 1500m freestyle, the most victories in the event by any country, and have resulted in the event being dubbed ''"Australia's race"'' by Australian commentators. Australia's first medal outside of freestyle did not come until [[Swimming at the 1932 Summer Olympics|1932]] when [[Clare Dennis]] and [[Bonnie Mealing]] won gold and silver in the 200m [[breaststroke]] and 100m [[backstroke swimming|backstroke]] respectively. It was not until [[John Davies (swimmer)|John Davies]]' victory in the 200m breaststroke in [[Swimming at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952]] that a male swimmer had won a medal outside of freestyle. Backstroke is Australia's weakest discipline, with [[David Theile]]'s two consecutive golds in the 100m backstroke being the only victories in the discipline.<ref name = "all"/><ref name="Hackett">{{cite web |url= http://www.olympics.com.au/athletes.cfm?AthleteID=2586|title= Grant Hackett|accessdate=2006-11-17 |format= |publisher= [[Australian Olympic Committee]]}}</ref>

== All medalists ==
The following table includes all those who have won medals, including as part of relay teams. Since [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], swimmers who participated in the preliminary heats but not in the final were awarded medals if the final team went on to claim a medal, whereas those prior to 1984 did not. Those who swam in the heats only are marked with an asterisk, multiple times if multiple medals were awarded for swimming in heats only. [[Malcolm Champion]], a member of the 4x200m freestyle relay team in 1912, was a New Zealander, competing as part of the combined Australasia team. His team-mates in the combined relay team were [[Cecil Healy]], [[Les Boardman]] and [[Harold Hardwick]]. <ref name = "all"/>
*'''[[Ian Thorpe]]''' is the most decorated Australian Olympian of all time, in terms of gold and total medals. His three gold and two silver at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] are the largest in a single Olympics by an Australian.<ref name="Thorpe"/>
*'''[[Dawn Fraser]]''' and '''[[Murray Rose]]''' jointly held the previous records for gold medals, and Fraser the record of eight medals in total, prior to Thorpe.<ref name = "record">{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Malcolm|title=Australia at the Olympics|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] Books|year=2000|id= ISBN 0-7333-0884-8|pages=358-359}}</ref>
