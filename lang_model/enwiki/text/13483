'''Chatteris''' is one of four market towns in the [[Fenland]] district of [[Cambridgeshire]], situated in [[The Fens]]   between [[Huntingdon]], [[March, Cambridgeshire|March]] and [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]]. The town is in the [[North East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Cambridgeshire]] parliamentary constituency. 

Mentioned in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of 1086, the town has evidence of continuous settlement from the Neolithic period and is locally reputed to have been the last refuge of [[Boudica]] as she fled from the [[Roman Empire|Romans]].<ref name=enjoyengland>[http://www.enjoyengland.com/destinations/find/east-of-england/cambridgeshire/chatteris.aspx Enjoy England.com], URL accessed May 18, 2008</ref> The parish of Chatteris is large, covering 6099 hectares, and for much of its history was a raised island in the low-lying [[wetland]] of the Fens. Following the draining of the Fens, beginning in the 17th Century and completed in the 19th Century, the town has become a centre of agriculture and related industry. 

According to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]], the town has a population of 8,820 although this is likely to be much higher due to extensive housing developments in recent years. Indeed, due to its proximity to [[Cambridge]], [[Huntingdon]] and [[Peterborough]], the town has in recent years become popular as a [[commuter town]]. 

==Location and road network==
The town is situated in [[The Fens]] between [[Huntingdon]], [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St. Ives]], [[Peterborough]], [[March, Cambridgeshire|March]] and [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]]. It is a key turning point on the [[A141 road (Great Britain)|A141 road]] (known as the [[Isle of Ely]] way<ref>{{cite map |publisher= |title=Google Maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.456,0.055&spn=0.1,0.1&t=m&q=52.456,0.055 |edition= |year=2009 |cartography=Tele Atlas |scale= |series= |page= |section= |inset= |accessdate=2009-09-06 |isbn= |id= }}</ref>) and the starting point of the [[A142 road (Great Britain)|A142 road]] to Ely and Suffolk (known as [[Henry Ireton|Ireton's Way]]<ref>{{cite map |publisher= |title=Google Maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.456,0.055&ie=UTF8&ll=52.437909,0.082054&spn=0.037569,0.095358&z=14 |edition= |year=2009 |cartography=Tele Atlas |scale= |series= |page= |section= |inset= |accessdate=2009-09-06 |isbn= |id= }}</ref>). The town also has important links to Cambridge and the [[A14]] via the B1050 to [[Bar Hill]]. The town centre traffic was bypassed in 1986, with the disused route of the former [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St. Ives]] extension of the [[Great Eastern Railway]] being used to build the A141 to March and [[Guyhirn]].<ref>[http://www.fenland.gov.uk/assets/localplan/downloads/part2/Chatteris/Chatteris.pdf Fenland District Wide Local Plan: Chatteris]] (Adopted August 1993), Fenland District Council</ref>

==Government and policing==
The town is in the [[North East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Cambridgeshire]] parliamentary constituency, with the incumbent MP being the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Malcolm Moss]]. The constituency has traditionally been considered a [[safe seat|safe]] Conservative seat, although the Liberal MP [[Clement Freud]] held the seat from 1973 to 1987.<ref>[http://www.malcmoss.easynet.co.uk/constituencyprofile.htm Malcolm Moss] constituency profile, URL accessed August 20, 2009</ref> The town is locally governed by [[Cambridgeshire County Council]], [[Fenland|Fenland District Council]] and Chatteris Town Council, each performing separate functions.

The town is historically part of the [[Isle of Ely]], once under the secular juristriction of the [[Bishop of Ely]], a power ended by the Liberty of Ely Act, 1837.<ref>Liberty of Ely Act, 1837 (7 Will 4 & 1 Vict c.53)</ref> After various changes throughout the 19th and 20th Centiries, following the recommendations of the [[Local Government Commission for England (1958<U+2013>1967)|Local Government Commission for England]], on 1 April 1965 the bulk of the area was merged to form [[Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely]], and since the [[Local Government Act 1972]], Chatteris has been part of the wider [[Cambridgeshire County Council]]. 

Under the [[Police Act 1964]] and local government reform in 1974, the Isle of Ely Constabulary became part of the present [[Cambridgeshire Constabulary]].<ref>[http://www.theera.free-online.co.uk/index.htm Cambridgeshire Constabulary History] The Badgers Lair (retrieved [[11 December]] [[2005]])</ref> A small [[police station]] is situated in East Park Street, open on Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday.<ref>[http://www.cambs.police.uk/contactus/maps.asp Cambridgeshire Constabulary], URL accessed August 20, 2009</ref>

==History==
===Toponymy and early history===
Chatteris's name probably derives from the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''Caeteric'' - ''Ceto'' meaning a wood and ''Ric'', a river, although it may also derive from "cader", meaning [[hill fort]], suggesting a similar site to the nearby [[Stonea Camp]].<ref>''[http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/AE692FF2-3178-4C4E-AF17-F84157F9DF56/0/EUSFenlandChatteris.pdf The Historic Towns of Cambridgeshire, An Extensive Urban Survey: Chatteris]'', Cambridgeshire County Council publication (draft, 2001), 9</ref> The town was mentioned in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' as "Cetriz" and "Cateriz".<ref>''[http://hawkshome.net/history/chatteris/history_of_chatteris.htm Kelly's Directory of Cambridgeshire]'', (London: Kelly's Directories Limited, 1900), pp.99.</ref> 

Archeological evidence has been found of [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] settlements in the area, and Chatteris possesses what has been interpreted as the only upstanding Neolithic boundaries in Fenland.<ref>''[http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/AE692FF2-3178-4C4E-AF17-F84157F9DF56/0/EUSFenlandChatteris.pdf The Historic Towns of Cambridgeshire, An Extensive Urban Survey: Chatteris]'', Cambridgeshire County Council publication (draft, 2001), 14</ref> Saxon evidence is less well preserved, although in 679, Hunna, the chaplain to [[<U+00C6>thelthryth|<U+00C6>thelthryth of Ely]] built a [[hermitage]] on Honey Hill.<ref>''[http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/AE692FF2-3178-4C4E-AF17-F84157F9DF56/0/EUSFenlandChatteris.pdf The Historic Towns of Cambridgeshire, An Extensive Urban Survey: Chatteris]'', Cambridgeshire County Council publication (draft, 2001), 20</ref> More apocryphically, Chatteris is reputed to have been the last refuge of [[Boudica]] as she fled from the [[Roman Empire|Romans]].<ref name=enjoyengland/>

===Medieval period===
The miraculous story of the first known [[parishioner]] of the town, [[Bricstan|Bricstan of Chatteris]], is documented in the ''[[Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' by the Chronicler [[Orderic Vitalis]] (1075 - c.1142).<ref>[http://www.archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalhi02ordeuoft/ecclesiasticalhi02ordeuoft_djvu.txt Full text of ''The Ecclesiastical history of England and Normandy''] at the [[Internet Archive]] (note: unedited)</ref> According to the legend, Bricstan was a pious [[free tenant]] from the town who had joined the monastery at [[Ely Cathedral]] in 1115 to begin training as a monk. However, he was accused of theft and imprisoned in London. The legend recounts that one night he had a vision of [[Saint Etheldreda]] coming towards him, and as if by a miracle, his heavy chains fell from him and he was shackled no longer. When he awoke from his dream, he discovered that this was indeed true and he was free of his chains.<ref>Lois L. Huneycutt, ''Matilda of Scotland: a study in medieval queenship'' (Woodbridge: Boydell Press) 91.</ref> The wife of [[Henry I of England|Henry I]],  [[Matilda of Scotland]] heard of the miracle, and she assured herself that he was no rogue or thief, issued a writ of pardon and declared him a free man.<ref>Revd John Towers, "Bricstan Hall? Who was <U+201C>Bricstan<U+201D>?" ''Chatteris Parish Magazine''. Vol.33 Issue 6. June 2007</ref>  

During the Medieval period, the town was dominated by [[Chatteris Abbey]], a small [[Benedictine]] [[nunnery]] dedicated to St Mary, built in 980 by Alfwen the niece of King [[Edgar I of England|Edgar]] and one of only eight nunneries mentioned in the ''[[Domesday Book]]''. Throughout its existence, the Abbey was comparatively poor compared to other foundations, due to a lack of royal [[patronage]] and a consequent lack of [[Tithe#Tithing_in_the_Middle_Ages|tithe]] estates. As a result, the abbey survived the first wave of closures during the [[dissolution of the monasteries]], but was surrendered to the King's commissioners in 1538, by which time there were eleven nuns in residence.<ref>Claire Breay (ed.), <i>The Cartulary of Chatteris Abbey </i>, (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 1999). ISBN 0-85115-750-5. p.96</ref>
[[File:Park House, Chatteris.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A privately owned 1847 watercolour of Park House before its demolition. Elements of the [[Chatteris Abbey|dissolved abbey]] can be seen in the walls, including Norman arches.]]
At this date fourteen local families still used the abbey church as parochial but this, unusually, did not save it from demolition, the parishioners being transferred to nearby St Peter and St Paul's church in the area. It has been conjectured that due to the short space between them, the parish church may have been the abbey church,<ref>''[http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/AE692FF2-3178-4C4E-AF17-F84157F9DF56/0/EUSFenlandChatteris.pdf The Historic Towns of Cambridgeshire, An Extensive Urban Survey: Chatteris]'', Cambridgeshire County Council publication (draft, 2001), 19</ref> although Claire Breay's ''Cartulary of Chatteris Abbey'' discounts this idea, citing that historical documentation clearly defines two separate churches. A range of the cloister buildings survived as part of a mansion known as Park House. This was demolished in 1847 and the site has now completely vanished beneath streets and housing, although the "Park Streets" of Chatteris mark the boundary of its walls and several buildings contain stone originating from the abbey.<ref>Claire Breay (ed.), <i>The Cartulary of Chatteris Abbey </i>, (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 1999). ISBN 0-85115-750-5, p.92</ref> A large portion of the town was destroyed by a great fire in 1310, which destroyed the nunnery and a large portion of the church, leaving only sections of the base of the tower.<ref>{{Cite book |editor=Salzman, L.F. |title=

===Later history===
Later fires in 1706 and 1864 destroyed most medieval and Georgian architecture, and a large proportion of the town's [[listed building]]s date from the Victorian period onwards.<ref>''[http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/AE692FF2-3178-4C4E-AF17-F84157F9DF56/0/EUSFenlandChatteris.pdf The Historic Towns of Cambridgeshire, An Extensive Urban Survey: Chatteris]'', Cambridgeshire County Council publication (draft, 2001), 13</ref> However, many of the pasture fields on the outskirts of the town have evidence of [[ridge and furrow]] farming practices, although these are under threat by current building proposals.

To the north of the town runs the [[Forty Foot Drain]], a large river also called [[Cornelius Vermuyden|Vermuyden]]'s Drain, after the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] engineer whose name is associated with the fen drainage works of the middle of the 17th Century. Several of the older buildings of the town show evidence of the Dutch architectural style.<ref>[http://www.chatteris.org/chatteris Chatteris History], URL accessed May 18, 2008</ref>

Chatteris is a [[market town]] and has possessed this designation since 1834, although an earlier market existed in the town, which was discontinued due to poor roads in 1808.<ref>[http://www.fenland.gov.uk/ccm/content/technical/market-towns/chatteris-history.en;jsessionid=ajJITDmhM-J8 Fenland District Council website], URL accessed May 22, 2008</ref> A small market is still held every Friday. Following the [[Beeching Axe]], [[Chatteris railway station]], formerly on the [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St. Ives]] extension of the [[Great Eastern Railway]] was closed in March 1967.<ref>[http://hipweb.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/cgi-bin/cambscoll/history.pl?term=Chatteris&category=village&exact=exact Kelly's Directory of Cambridgeshire]'', (London: Kelly's Directories Limited, 1900), pp.99.</ref><ref>[http://www.empressgroup.co.uk/chatteris/index.html Chatteris Town History],  URL accessed May 22, 2008</ref>

==Population and demographics==
The [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]] found the population of Chatteris to be 8,820 people living in 3809 households, with the average number of people per dwelling 2.31.<ref name=census>[http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/7FC1F73F-DA35-4FB3-ACA4-8A14AABE2603/0/Chatteris.pdf Chatteris Parish] in the ''[[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]]''. The Research Group. Cambridgeshire County Council, October 2003</ref> However, since 2001, there have been significant housing developments which have substantially increased this number. The census found that 98.9% of the population of the town were of the white ethnic group.<ref name=census/> The parish of Chatteris is large, covering 6099 [[hectare]]s, equalling an average population density of 1.45, although most of the dwellings are concentrated in a smaller area, the outskirts of the town consisting of farmland.<ref name=census/> 

==Geography and climate==
Chatteris is situated in the middle of [[the Fens]], the lowest-lying area in the United Kingdom, with most of the land surrounding the town being below [[sea level]], although the highest point in the Fens (26 feet above sea level) is within Chatteris's parish boundaries.<ref>[http://www.malcmoss.easynet.co.uk/landscape.htm Malcolm Moss MP constituency page], URL accessed September 8, 2009</ref> The [[peat]]y land surrounding the town is largely used for agriculture, drained by numerous ditches and dykes, and there are two large drainage rivers near the town - the [[Forty Foot Drain]], also known as Vermuyden's Drain, and the Sixteen Foot Drain.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=21900 "North Witchford Hundred: Chatteris"], ''A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 4: City of Ely; Ely, N. and S. Witchford and Wisbech Hundreds'' (2002), pp. 103-109. URL accessed September 8, 2009.</ref>

There are no [[Met Office]] recording stations in the Fens, but an indication of rainfall and temperature of the county town [[Cambridge]] on the edge of the Fens shows that rainfall is below the national average, and in a wider study of [[East Anglia]], the region had temperatures comparible with London, the warmest part of the UK.<ref>[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/ee/ Climate: Eastern England], [[Met Office]].gov, URL accessed September 8, 2009.</ref>

==Religion==
[[Image:Church 193.jpg<U+200E>|thumb|right|The Parish Church of St Peter & St Paul, Chatteris]]
The 2001 Census found that 6596 (74.8%) of people in the town stated Christian to be their religion, with 54 (0.6%) of other religions and 2163 (24.5%) as having no religion.<ref name=census/>

The parish church of St Peter & St Paul is situated in the centre of the town. A church has been on the site since at least 1162, although the current tower dates from 1352. The building had fallen into disrepair during the 19th Century, and the majority of the building is the result of an intensive restoration in 1910. This included restoring a pitched roof and adding new aisles, although the nave arches are original.<ref>[http://www.druidic.org/camchurch/churches/chatteris.htm St Peter & St Paul Chatteris] at the Cambridgeshire Churches website, URL accessed August 27, 2009</ref> In 1935, a new two manual [[Harrison & Harrison]] organ was installed, a fine example of a pneumatic action instrument.<ref>[http://www.harrison-organs.co.uk/c.html Harrison & Harrison organ catalogue], URL accesssed August 27, 2009</ref> Recent years have seen the construction of several new facilities, such as the [[Bricstan]] room extension.<ref>[http://www.chatteris.org/parisg-church Chatteris Parish Church history], URL accessed May 19, 2008</ref> The church lists itself as being of the [[low church]] branch of the [[Church of England]].<ref>[http://www.achurchnearyou.com/chatteris-st-peter-st-paul/ St Peter & St Paul] at A Church Near You, URL accessed August 20, 2009</ref> The church also hosts the town's [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] congregation.<ref>[http://www.chatteris.org/services-at-the-church St Peter & St Paul website], URL accessed August 20, 2009</ref> 

The Emmanuel Church in East Park Street was created through the union of the [[Methodist]], [[United Reformed]], and [[Baptist Union]] churches in Chatteris in 1990. It is based in the former United Reformed building in East Park Street, although several of the former chapel buildings still exist around the town.<ref>[http://www.emmanuelchatteris.org/group/group.aspx?id=24476 Emmanuel Church], URL accessed May 19, 2008</ref> The town also has a [[Salvation Army]] citadel, also in East Park Street.<ref>[http://www1.salvationarmy.org.uk/uki/www_uki.nsf/vw-sublinks/15691D1DD9ED447F80256F030047439B?openDocument Salvation Army website], URL accessed May 19, 2008</ref>

==In popular culture==
In 2005, cult British indie band [[Half Man Half Biscuit]] - best known for "The Trumpton Riots" and "Dickie Davies Eyes", featured a song entitled "For What Is Chatteris" on their award-winning ''[[Achtung Bono]]'' album. The song extolled the virtues of the town offset against how little the best place in the world can suddenly become to someone when the one they love is no longer resident: "a market town that lacks quintessence/that's Chatteris without your presence".<ref>[http://www.halfmanhalfbiscuithalfhearted.com/2007/06/for-what-is-chatteris-achtung-bono.html halfmanhalfbiscuithalfhearted.com], URL accessed September 8, 2008</ref> News of the song made the headlines of the ''[[Archant#Weekly_Paid_Newspapers|Cambridgeshire Times]]'' and the ''[[Peterborough Evening Telegraph]]'' during September 2005, a month before the album's official release.<ref>"[http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=845&ArticleID=1200423 Does this inspire you to rock 'n' roll?]" ''Peterborough Evening Telegraph'', 23 September 2005.
