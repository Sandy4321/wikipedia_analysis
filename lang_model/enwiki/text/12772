'''''The Color of Money''''' is a 1986 [[drama film]] directed by [[Martin Scorsese]] from a screenplay by [[Richard Price (writer)|Richard Price]], based on the 1984 novel of the same name by [[Walter Tevis]]. The film stars [[Paul Newman]] and [[Tom Cruise]], with [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Helen Shaver]], and [[John Turturro]]. Newman won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance. The film featured an original score by [[Robbie Robertson]].

The film continues the story of [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]] [[Hustling|hustler]] and [[Glossary of cue sports terms#stake|stakehorse]] Edward "Fast Eddie" Felson from Tevis' first novel, ''[[The Hustler (novel)|The Hustler]]'' (1959), with Newman reprising his role from [[The Hustler (film)|its film adaptation]] (1961). The film begins at a point more than 20 years after the events of the previous film, with Eddie retired from the pool circuit. Although Tevis did author a screenplay for the film, the filmmakers decided not to use it, instead crafting a new one.<ref>LoBrutto, Vincent (November 30, 2007). ''Martin Scorsese: A Biography''.

==Plot==
Eddie Felson ([[Paul Newman]]) is a former pool shark turned successful liquor salesman.  One night he meets Vincent ([[Tom Cruise]]) a talented young charismatic pool player who hustles small time pool games while working as a clerk at a toy store.  Eddie meets with Vincent and Vincent's girlfriend/manager Carmen ([[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]]).  Eddie, who misses the excitement of pool hustling, convinces the pair to come on the road with him so that he can teach Vincent how to become a more successful pool hustler.

With Eddie providing the money for their bets, Vincent plays a series of pool halls where Eddie tries to teach him that "pool excellence is not about excellent pool".  Although Carmen is a quick study, Vincent chafes at Eddie's scams, which routinely require him to play well below his abilities.  Eventually, Eddie picks up a cue himself, and does well at several games before being taken in by a pool shark named Amos ([[Forest Whitaker]]).  Humiliated, Eddie leaves Vincent and Carmen with enough money to make it to the championships in [[Atlantic City]] and returns home.

Comforted by his girlfriend Janelle ([[Helen Shaver]]), Eddie gets new glasses and begins working out and practicing.  He eventually earns a spot in the championships and finds himself facing off against a more world wise Vincent.  Eddie beats Vincent, but later, when he is celebrating with Janelle, Vincent arrives and informs Eddie that he intentionally lost in order to collect on a bet.  He gives Eddie 8,000 dollars as his "cut" but Eddie returns the money, saying that he wants to beat Vincent legitimately.  The two set up a private match where Eddie informs Vincent that if he doesn't beat him now, he will in the future because "I'm back!"

Many top American pool players of the 1980s had speaking roles, including [[Steve Mizerak]], [[Grady Mathews]], and [[Keith McCready]], and there were many [[cameo appearance]]s, including [[Jimmy Mataya]], Mark Jarvis, Howard Vickery and Louie Roberts. Mike Sigel was technical director, and he and [[Ewa Mataya Laurance]] served as technical consultants and shot-performers on the film. A young [[Forest Whitaker]] makes an extended appearance as a pool hustler as well.

Director Scorsese has a cameo walking his dog, and another playing pool. Another notable cameo is that of [[Iggy Pop]], who plays one of the many contenders on the road.

==Production==
Scorsese has cited the influence of techniques and lighting in the 1947 Powell-Pressburger classic ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' in making the film. In particular he states that the extreme close ups of Tom Cruise around the pool table were inspired by those of the nuns in that film.<ref name="DVD">{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Black-Narcissus-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00004XQN4|title=Black Narcissus (The Criterion Collection) (2001) DVD commentary|publisher=Criterion|accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref> Newman said that the best advice he was given by Scorsese was to "try ''not'' to be funny". Cruise performed most of his own shots. An exception was a {{Cuegloss|Jump shot|jump shot}} over two balls to sink another. Scorsese believed Cruise could learn the shot, but that it would take too long, so the shot was performed for him by [[Mike Sigel]]. Standing in for the extremely valuable "[[George Balabushka|Balabushka]]" cue in the movie was actually a Joss J-18 (which later became the Joss N-07), made to resemble a classic Balabushka.<ref name="JossCue">[http://www.pooldawg.com/product/joss-n7-the-color-of-money-pool-cue-stick Commercial information about the Joss N7 model pool cue]</ref>

Absent from the film is the character Minnesota Fats, played by [[Jackie Gleason]] in ''The Hustler''. Newman later said that he had wanted the character to appear, but that none of the attempts to include him fit well into the story that was being written. According to Scorsese, Gleason apparently agreed with Newman's opinion that Minnesota Fats was not essential to the film's story. Scorsese said that Gleason was presented a draft of the script that had Fats worked into the narrative, but that upon reading it, Gleason declined to reprise the role because he felt that the character seemed to have been added as "an afterthought".<ref name=Forsberg /><ref>Levy, Shawn (May 5, 2009).

===Opening voiceover===
Reflecting the general theme of the film, director [[Martin Scorsese]] delivers an opening uncredited [[voiceover]], describing the game of [[nine-ball]], over a scene of cigarette smoke and a piece of cue chalk:

{{Quote|Nine-Ball is rotation pool, the balls are pocketed in numbered order. The only ball that means anything, that wins it, is the 9. Now, the player can shoot eight trick shots in a row, blow the 9, and lose. On the other hand, the player can get the 9 in on the break, if the balls spread right, and win. Which is to say, that luck plays a part in nine-ball. But for some players, luck itself is an art.}}

The soundtrack to the motion picture was released by [[MCA Records]] in 1986.<ref>The catalogue number for the original CD release was DMCG 6023. The soundtrack information was taken from the CD booklet.</ref>
