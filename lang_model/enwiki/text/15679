'''''Dry As a Bone''''' is the second [[extended play|EP]] by the American [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Green River (band)|Green River]]. It was released in July 1987 through [[Sub Pop]] Records.

==Overview==
The EP features the band's first material with guitarist [[Bruce Fairweather]], formerly of bassist [[Jeff Ament]]'s previous band, Deranged Diction. In June 1986, the band began production on its second EP with local producer [[Jack Endino]] at [[Reciprocal Recording]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington]]. Green River chose to record ''Dry As a Bone'' for [[Bruce Pavitt]]'s new label, [[Sub Pop]] Records. However, Pavitt couldn't afford to release it until the following year, and, as had happened with ''[[Come on Down]]'', the record was delayed. ''Dry As a Bone'' was finally released through Sub Pop Records in July 1987, a full year after it was recorded. It was the new label's first non-compilation release. ''Dry As a Bone'' was promoted by Sub Pop as "ultra-loose GRUNGE that destroyed the morals of a generation."<ref name="Azerrad">Azerrad, Michael. ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]''. Little, Brown and Company, 2001. ISBN 0-316-78753-1</ref> The album's cover art was photographed by [[Charles Peterson (photographer)|Charles Peterson]]. The song "Ozzie" was done originally by [[Tales of Terror (band)|Tales of Terror]]. Steve Huey of [[Allmusic]] has called it Green River's "strongest individual release...perfecting their sleazy, raucous fusion of '70s [[hard rock]] and post-[[hardcore punk]]."<ref name="allmusic"/> It was reissued in 1990 along with the album ''[[Rehab Doll]]'' (plus bonus tracks) as the ''[[Dry As a Bone/Rehab Doll]]'' compilation album.
