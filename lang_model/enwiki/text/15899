"'''Dream Logic'''" is the fifth [[List of Fringe episodes|episode]] of the [[Fringe (season 2)|second season]] of the American [[science fiction]] [[drama]] [[television program|television series]] ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', and the 25th episode overall. It was written by [[Josh Singer]] and directed by [[Paul A. Edwards]]. The episode follows several people seemingly dreaming while still awake, leading the Fringe team to investigate the dangerous side effects of a sleep study.

On its initial American broadcast on October&nbsp;15,&nbsp;2009 on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]], "Dream Logic" was watched by an estimated 5.78&nbsp;million viewers. It received mixed reviews, with multiple critics noting it was considerably worse in quality than the [[Momentum Deferred|previous week's episode]] while at the same time praising the case's ties to [[Peter Bishop|Peter]]'s past as well as the return of [[Sam Weiss]].

==Plot==
In [[Seattle]] a man named Greg Leiter (Jim Thorburn) hallucinates that his boss and coworkers are demons, leading Greg to attack and murder the boss. Greg is hospitalized and falls asleep for sixteen hours; when [[Olivia Dunham|Olivia]] ([[Anna Torv]]) and [[Peter Bishop|Peter]] ([[Joshua Jackson]]) interview him in the hospital, he tells them his boss was a demon out of a bad dream before suffering a seizure and having his hair turn white. [[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Walter]] ([[John Noble]]) posits that Greg died from "acute exhaustion". However, believing Seattle to be like the mental institution, Walter desires to go home in [[Boston]] and run tests on the corpse from there.

Olivia and Peter learn Greg was being treated for a sleep disorder, and that his dreams had involved demons until they stopped several months ago. Another hallucinating victim turns up in Seattle and dies. The Fringe team discover that both victims had a [[brain<U+2013>computer interface]] chip attached to their [[thalamus]], the part of the brain controlling dreams. [[Phillip Broyles|Broyles]] ([[Lance Reddick]]) and [[Nina Sharp|Nina]] ([[Blair Brown]]) reveal new information leading to the sleep researcher Dr. Nayak ([[Ravi Kapoor]]) who implanted the chips. Another victim named Diana (Jovanna Huguet) hallucinates at a restaurant and kills a coworker before similarly dying of exhaustion. 

Olivia and Peter first suspect Dr. Nayak's research assistant Zach (Jarrett Knowles) but find him dead. Back in Boston Walter believes the chips lead to [[mind control]] and tests this on the FBI agent assigned to him while Peter and Olivia are away. However, during these tests Walter soon changes his theory; the dreams are being stolen from their hosts to cause a "[[Substance intoxication|high]]" in Dr. Nayak, who is receiving them, and has two personalities. Peter and Olivia shut down the dream equipment before Nayak kills another victim, but the doctor dies in the process. The final scene shows Peter dreaming about his childhood when Walter kidnaps him, an event Peter normally has no memory of; Peter wakes up confused but still unaware of what his father did.

In a sideplot, Olivia is grieving for her partner [[Charlie Francis (Fringe)|Charlie]] ([[Kirk Acevedo]]), whom she discovered was murdered by a shapeshifter in the [[Momentum Deferred|previous episode]]. [[Sam Weiss]] ([[Kevin Corrigan]]) helps her work through it by giving her a "project" that requires her to collect business cards from people wearing the color red. She is told to grab random letters from the names, that once unscrambled read "you're gonna be fine".

===Reviews===
[[AOL TV]] writer Jane Boursaw wrote, "The whole storyline with the creepy dual-personality doc and the mind-control-dreams was good, though I sort of knew the doc must be involved from the beginning.

{{Quote box
 | quote  = "This latest episode was all about dreams, which was pretty ironic considering it nearly put me to sleep. Not that this was a particularly bad episode, just a bland one. I'm most intrigued by ''Fringe'' when the overarching plot is at play, like [[Momentum Deferred|last week's tremendously awesome episode]]. This week, I guess I was fine with it <U+2014> thanks largely due to the cool effects seen in the accidental killers' waking-dreams <U+2014> but I'm not satisfied with 'fine,' certainly not when it comes to ''Fringe.''"

[[MTV]] writer Josh Wigler thought the episode "nearly put [him] to sleep," as it was "bland" and "a bit of a dud".<ref name=mtvreview/> The episode however did lead Wigler to "start dig[ging]" Sam Weiss, and also to enjoying Olivia's subplot, but believed the episode's [[Villain of the week|monster-of-the-week]] could have been used to actually parallel her trauma; Wigler appreciated how the Fringe case tied into Walter and Peter's backstories.<ref name=mtvreview/> He concluded, "It wasn't bad enough to make me concerned for the future of ''Fringe'' or anything, but it certainly didn't keep me on the edge of my seat waiting for the next crazy twist like last week. I'm still loving this season, but tonight's episode was one of the weaker outings."<ref name=mtvreview>{{Cite web|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/10/15/fringe-episode-205-dream-logic/ |title='Fringe' Episode 2.05: 'Dream Logic' |publisher=[[MTV]] |last=Wigler |first=Josh |date=2009-10-15 |accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref>  [[Newsarama]]'s Chanel Reeder stated "Dream Logic" "certainly put the brakes on the speed that ''Fringe'' had gained in the previous" episode, but praised the connection with Peter's past as "one of the most interesting underlying parts".<ref name=newsarama/> Reeder's favorite part was Sam Weiss, calling him "a fantastic dimension to the show".<ref name=newsarama>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/tv/091020-Fringe-Post-Game.html |title=Post Game TV Recap: FRINGE S2E5: "Dream Logic" |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |last=Reeder |first=Chanel |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref> Josie Kafka of [[Open Salon]] was more positive than other reviewers, and in particular highlighted the episode's humor, "Almost all of the Cambridge scenes were funny: Astrid and Walter have a great rapport, especially when there's a rube in the room for them to play with."<ref name=opensalon/> She concluded "I liked this one, more for the great Peter/Olivia and Walter/Astrid stuff than the plot of the week," and gave the episode "Three out of four anagrams".<ref name=opensalon>{{Cite web|url=http://open.salon.com/blog/josie_kafka/2009/12/21/fringe_dream_logic_205 |title=Fringe: Dream Logic (2.05) |publisher=[[Open Salon]] |last=Kafka |first=Josie |date=2009-12-22 |accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref>

After the episode's broadcast, ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' published an article analyzing the science depicted. They concluded that the [[Brain<U+2013>computer interface]] (BCI) chips, like the ones used in the episode to tie the victims' brains to the computer used by Dr. Laxmeesh Nayak, have also been used on real-life human subjects, though not in relation to controlling sleep cycles. However, the article continued that it is "not currently possible" for BCI chips to "facilitate direct transfer of understandable information from one person's brain to another", nor is it possible for the chips to "directly read another person's thoughts or dreams" and steal them.<ref name=popmech/> In addition, ''Popular Mechanics'' noted that Walter's theory of the victims' deaths being caused by exhaustion is "pure bunk", as there are many long-term experiments that have safely tested humans' deprivation of [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]].<ref name=popmech/> According to one scientist interviewed, though chips shown in "Dream Logic" cause hallucinations, paranoid thoughts, and a disconnect from reality, these traits are "not even remotely possible" outside of fiction.<ref name=popmech>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/digital/fact-vs-fiction/4334189 |title=On Fringe, Brain-Computer Interface Chips Have Real-Life Inspiration |work=[[Popular Mechanics]] |last=McCarthy |first=Erin |date=2009-10-16 |accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref>
