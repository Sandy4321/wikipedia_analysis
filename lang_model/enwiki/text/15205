'''PNC Park''' is a [[baseball park]] located in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. It is the fifth home of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], the city's [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) franchise.<ref name="official"/><ref name="ESPN"/> It opened during the [[2001 Major League Baseball season]], after the [[building implosion|controlled implosion]] of the Pirates' previous home, [[Three Rivers Stadium]]. The ballpark is named for locally based [[PNC Financial Services]], which purchased the [[naming rights]] in 1998.<ref name=PNCfs>{{cite news |first= Lauren|last= Jaeger|title= PNC Bank Purchases Naming Rights To Pittsburgh Pirates' New Stadium|url= http://www.allbusiness.com/services/amusement-recreation-services/4578408-1.html|publisher= [[AllBusiness.com]]|date= 1998-09-17|accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref> PNC Park features a natural grass playing surface and seats 38,496 people for baseball, which as of 2008, is the second-smallest capacity of any Major League park.

Funded in conjunction with [[Heinz Field]], the $216&nbsp;million park stands along the [[Allegheny River]], on the [[Northside (Pittsburgh)|Northside]] of Pittsburgh with a view of [[Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Downtown Pittsburgh]]. Plans to build a new stadium for the Pirates originated in 1991, but did not come to fruition for five years. Built in the style of "classic" stadiums, such as Boston's [[Fenway Park]], PNC Park also introduced unique features, such as the use of [[limestone]] in the building's facade.<ref name="official"/> The park also features a riverside concourse, steel truss work, an extensive out-of-town scoreboard, and many local eateries. Constructed quicker than most modern stadiums, workers built PNC Park in a 24-month span.

Since completion, PNC Park has been hailed as one of the best ballparks in the country. It has the third-cheapest average ticket prices of any MLB stadium and has helped attract business to surrounding establishments, though the Pirates have not had a winning season since they moved to the stadium. PNC Park hosted the [[2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]], the fifth MLB All-Star Game held in Pittsburgh. 

==History==
===Planning and funding===
On September 5, 1991, [[Pittsburgh]] mayor [[Sophie Masloff]] proposed a new 44,000-seat stadium for the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] on the city's Northside.<ref name=OnDeck/> [[Three Rivers Stadium]], the Pirates' home at the time, had been designed for functionality rather than "architecture and aesthetics".<ref name=OnDeck/> The location of Three Rivers Stadium came to be criticized for being in a hard-to-access portion of the city, where traffic congestion occured before and after games.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Curt|authorlink=Curt Smith (author)|title=Storied Stadiums|year=2001|publisher=Carroll & Graf|location=New York City|isbn=0786711876}}</ref> Discussions about a new ballpark took place, but were never seriously considered until entrepreneur [[Kevin McClatchy]] purchased the team in February 1996. Until McClatchy's purchase, plans about the team staying in Pittsburgh were uncertain.<ref name=OnDeck>{{cite journal |last= Bouma|first= Ben|year= 1998|title= Heading for Home|journal= On Deck: The Official Magazine of the Pittsburgh Pirates|volume= 3|issue= 3|pages= pp. 42<U+2013>8|accessdate=2008-07-20}}</ref> In 1996, Masloff's successor, [[Tom Murphy (mayor)|Tom Murphy]], created the "Forbes Field II Task Force". Made up of 29&nbsp;political and business leaders, the team studied the challenges of constructing a new ballpark. Their final report, published on June 26, 1996, evaluated 13&nbsp;possible locations. The "North Side site" was recommended due to its affordable cost, potential to develop the surrounding area, and opportunity to incorporate the city skyline into the stadium's design.<ref name=OnDeck/> The site selected for the ballpark is just upriver from the site of early Pirates home field [[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A47798|title= Was there a baseball field that the Pittsburgh Pirates played in before Forbes Field in Oakland?|accessdate=2008-07-30 |author= Chris Potter|date= 2008-06-12|work= You Had To Ask|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh City Paper]]''}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06192/700663-341.stm|title= Exposition Park|accessdate=2008-07-30 |date= 2006-07-11|publisher= ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''}}</ref>

After a political debate, public money was used to fund PNC Park. Originally, a [[sales tax]] increase was proposed to fund three projects: PNC Park, [[Heinz Field]], and an expansion of the [[David L. Lawrence Convention Center]]. However, after the proposal was rejected in a [[referendum]], the city developed ''Plan&nbsp;B''.<ref>{{cite web|title= Plan B|publisher= ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''|url= http://www.post-gazette.com/planb/| accessdate= 2008-04-05}}</ref> Similarly controversial, the alternative proposal was labeled ''Scam&nbsp;B'' by opponents.<ref name="TD">{{cite news |last= Dvorchak|first= Robert|title= A TD for Plan B|publisher= ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''|date= 1998-06-21|url= http://www.post-gazette.com/regionstate/19980621bplanb5.asp|accessdate= 2008-04-05}}</ref> Some members of the [[Allegheny Regional Asset District]] felt that the Pirates' pledge of $40&nbsp;million toward the new stadium was too little, while others criticized the amount of public money allocated for Plan B.
