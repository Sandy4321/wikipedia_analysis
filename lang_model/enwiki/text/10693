"'''Forgive Me'''" is a song by British singer [[Leona Lewis]] featured on the North American version of her debut album ''[[Spirit (Leona Lewis album)|Spirit]]'' (2008). It was released as the fourth single of the album in the United Kingdom on 3 November 2008. The song was written by [[Akon|Aliaune "Akon" Thiam]], [[Claude Kelly]] and Giorgio Tuinfort, and produced by Akon. Lyrically, "Forgive Me" is a reference about a girl whom has found a new love and she is asking forgiveness to her old love.

The music video was inspired by several [[Musical theatre|Broadway musicals]]. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, but some of them criticised Lewis's voice for being very similar those of [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Mariah Carey]] voice. "Forgive Me" debuted at number five on the [[UK Singles Chart|British]] and [[Irish Singles Chart|Irish]] charts, making it Lewis's fourth single to achieve the top ten in the UK. It peaked at number one in the Slovak Airplay Chart and reached the top ten in [[Federation of the Italian Music Industry|Italy]] and [[Sverigetopplistan|Sweden]].
