'''Vincent Waggoner Carr''' (October 1, 1918 - February 25, 2004) was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[List of Speakers of the Texas House of Representatives|Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives]] and [[Attorney General of Texas]].

==Early years, education, military service==
Carr was born to Vincent Carr (1892<U+2013>1983) and the former Ruth Warlick (1897<U+2013>1985) in Fairlie in [[Hunt County, Texas|Hunt County]] east of [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]. In 1932, when the family [[bank]] in Fairlie closed, the Carrs moved to [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] just in time for Carr to graduate from [[Lubbock High School]] in 1936. The senior Carr found work at Stubbs Feed Seed Company and decided that he wanted his sons to attend college. As a youth, Carr worked as a farm hand, [[magazine]] salesman and [[theater]] usher. 

In 1940, he completed his [[bachelor of business administration]] degree at [[Texas Tech University]] (then Texas Technological College) in Lubbock. Although he immediately began his legal studies after Texas Tech, Carr did not graduate from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] law school until 1947. The delay came from his service in the [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]] as a [[Aviator|pilot]] during [[World War II]].

After they obtained their legal credentials, Carr and his brother, [[Warlick Carr|M. Warlick Carr]] (1921<U+2013>2008), established a law office in Lubbock. In 1948, Carr was appointed assistant district attorney for the 72nd Judicial District in Lubbock. He was also the elected county attorney for [[Lubbock County, Texas|Lubbock County]] from 1949 to 1951.

==Ten years in the legislature==
Carr was elected to the [[Texas House of Representatives]] from Lubbock District 19 in 1950. During his ensuing ten years of service, he focused on West Texas [[water quality]] and availability. Under his leadership, the legislature proposed a constitutional amendment and passed enabling legislation to establish the Texas Water Development Board. At its creation, the board was authorized to issue up to $200 million in water development bonds for the purpose of funding local water projects. Carr also helped to establish a [[code of ethics]] for legislators and [[lobbyist]]s. He promoted [[tourism]] and industrial development.

He was also [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the House for two consecutive terms, having served from 1957-1961. In his first election as Speaker, he won by eight votes 79-71 over his fellow Democratic member Joe Burkett, Jr. Through 1958, he was only the third person in Texas history to have been elected to two consecutive terms as Speaker. In the legislature Carr pushed for the creation of the [[Texas Youth Council]] and the recodification of juvenile laws, the modernization of [[workers' compensation]] statutes, the reorganization of the [[Texas Department of Insurance|State Insurance Board]], and the authorization and financing of a new [[Lorenzo de Zavala State Archives and Library Building|State Library and Archives Building]] in Austin.

==Attorney General of Texas==
In 1960, Carr ran, not for a sixth two-year term in the Texas House, but for attorney general. He lost the Democratic nomination to the [[incumbent]] [[Will Wilson|Will Reid Wilson, Sr.]], a native of [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] who since relocated to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. Wilson later became a Republican and in 1969 joined the [[Richard Nixon]] administration as an assistant U.S. attorney general in charge of the [[United States Department of Justice Criminal Division|Criminal Division of the U.S. Justice Department]]. Carr was elected attorney general in 1962<U+2014>he defeated Tom Reavley in the Democratic primary. He was reelected in 1964, as all statewide Republican candidates in Texas were again defeated in the Johnson-[[Hubert Humphrey|Humphrey]] landslide. As attorney general, he was involved in the prosecutions of swindler [[Billie Sol Estes]] of [[Pecos, Texas|Pecos]], and [[Jack Ruby]], or Jack Rubenstein, the Dallas [[nightclub]] owner who murdered [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], the [[assassination|assassin]] of [[U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]].

==Kennedy assassination==
On the morning of November 22, 1963, Carr and his wife, the former Ernestine Story (born April 22, 1920, in [[Wylie, Texas|Wylie]]), were among the dignitaries who ate breakfast with President and Mrs. Kennedy in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]. The president went on to [[Dealey Plaza]] in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], and the Carrs flew to the [[Texas Panhandle]] for a speaking engagement. Carr learned of the tragic consequences in Dallas as his plane landed. 

As fate intervened, Carr participated in the investigation of the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|JFK assassination]]. He sought to conduct a state probe, but that was blocked by the [[Warren Commission]], which was appointed by President Johnson to determine the circumstances leading to Kennedy's death. Carr testified that Oswald was working as an undercover agent for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and received $200 a month from September 1962 until his death in November 1963. However, the Warren Commission preferred to believe [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Director]] [[J. Edgar Hoover]], who denied Carr's affirmations.

Carr said that the combined state-federal probe was a success and that both teams worked well together. Years later, at the dedication of the [[Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum]] in Austin, Carr recalled that the investigation into the Kennedy assassination was thorough and professional: "It makes me sad that it [the assassination] happened, but it doesn't make me sad to share with the interested people of Texas about what this investigation revealed and how thorough it was and how nonpolitical it was."<ref>Carr's overall support for the Warren Commission's conclusions appears, among other sources, in this analysis: {{cite news

==U.S. Senate campaign, 1966==
As the sitting attorney general in 1966, Carr challenged [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[incumbent]] [[John Tower|John Goodwin Tower]] (1925<U+2013>1991) for the [[United States Senate]].  In doing so, Carr was unable to seek a third two-year term as Attorney General.  Carr was defeated, and was only the second Texas Democrat in state history to lose a statewide general election since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]; the first having been [[William A. Blakley]] of Dallas in his 1961 loss to Tower. Senator Tower received 842,501 votes (56.7 percent) to Carr's 643,855 (43.3 percent). In winning, Tower lost the majority of the [[rural]] districts to Carr, who had the strong support of both President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and [[Governor of Texas|Governor]] [[John B. Connally|John B. Connally, Jr.]], while Connally was still a Democrat. Tower, though, ran strongly in the larger urban areas. At the time of his loss to Tower, Carr had been voted the nation's best state attorney general by his peers.

==Last campaign, 1968==
After leaving public office in January 1967, Carr went into private practice and eventually joined the law firm of DeLeon and Boggins in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. In 1968, however, he was bitten again by the political bug and ran for governor in the Democratic primary in a race to succeed his friend, the retiring John Connally. He ran third in the primary, and the nomination and the election eventually went to his fellow Lubbockite, [[Preston Smith (governor)|Preston Smith]], who defeated the Republican attorney [[Paul Eggers]] of [[Wichita Falls, Texas|Wichita Falls]] and later Dallas in the first of two consecutive matches between the two.

==Sharpstown survivor==
In 1971, Carr was indicted and tried on charges of [[fraud]], [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], and filing false reports to the United States [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] in what was called the "Sharpstown scandal." [[Acquittal|Acquitted]] of all charges in 1974, he wrote the book, ''Waggoner Carr, Not Guilty'' (1977), with coauthor Jack Keever.

Carr had been considered part of the Connally wing of the Democratic Party prior to Connally's surprise defection in 1973 to the Republicans. A Distinguished Alumnus of [[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]], Carr was appointed by his former opponent, Governor Smith, to the university's board of regents and served from 1969 to 1972. He also was state commander of the [[American Legion]].

In 1989, Carr was selected to chair the Action for Metropolitan Government Committee in an attempt to unite the Austin municipal and [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] governments. He was awarded a certificate of appreciation from the Austin City Council in 1991, and that same year he was appointed by the [[Texas Supreme Court]] to serve on a citizens' commission examining the Texas judicial system.

==Death and legacy==

[[Image:Waggonner Carr gravestone, Texas State Cemetery IMG 2139.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Waggoner Carr tombstone at [[Texas State Cemetery]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]]]]

Carr died in Austin after a ten-year bout with [[cancer]]. He was preceded in death by his parents and his brother. He was survived by his wife Ernestine, whom he met as a student at Texas Tech. She graduated from Tech with a [[bachelor of science]] degree in [[home economics]]. They had one son, Dr. David William Carr (born 1949), a [[dentist]] in Austin, and his wife, Diana, and two granddaughters. He was also survived by two brothers, Warlick Carr and wife, Billilee "Bee" Regan Carr (both since deceased), and Dr. Robert L. Carr and wife Betty, and a sister, Virginia Campbell Carter and husband Bill, all of Lubbock. Carr was interred in the [[Texas State Cemetery]] in Austin. At the time of his death, Carr was working on books about [[Jesse James]] and the past attorneys general of Texas.

The ''[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]'' wrote on Carr's death: "He was a local boy made good, one who became a man of great power and responsibility in Texas but who never forgot his roots. And he was a loyal asset to Texas Tech who helped the university grow into what it is today."
