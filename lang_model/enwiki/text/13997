'''West Cape Howe National Park''' is a national park in [[Western Australia]] ([[Australia]]), {{convert|390|km}} southeast of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. The park is found between [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] and [[Denmark, Western Australia|Denmark]] within the [[City of Albany]] and in the [[Great Southern (Western Australia)|Great Southern]] region.

Torbay Head, the most southerly point of the mainland of Western Australia, is situated within the park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rainbowcoast.com.au/areas/albany/westcapehowe.htm|title=Rainbow Coast WA - West Cape Howe |year=2009|accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref>
The park is abutted against the coast of the [[Southern Ocean]] and takes up approximately {{convert|23|km|abbr=on}} of the coastline between Lowlands Beach and Forsythe Bluff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/component/option,com_hotproperty/task,view/id,101/Itemid,755/|title=Department of Environment - West Cape Howe National Park|year=2010|accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref>

== History ==

The park began as being vested in the Shire of Albany in 1977 for the purposes of recreation. By 1985 the area was gazetted as  C Class Reserve after agreement between the shire and vested in the [[Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia)|National Parks and Nature Conservancy Authority]]. Following the addition of an extra {{convert|41|ha|acre|abbr=on}} that was a timber reserve along the northern boundary the park was given an A Class status in 1987. The park is now a single reserve (26177) and is made up of an area of {{convert|3517|ha|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/pdf/nature/management/west_cape_howe.pdf|title=West Cape Howe Management Plan 1995-2005|year=1994|accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref>
The rare and ancient [[Archaeidae|Main's assassin spider]], currently listed as [[threatened]], was found to inhabit the park during a survey conducted in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verveenergy.com.au/documents/RARE_SPIDER_STUDY_AT_ALBANY_-_MEDIA_RELEASE.pdf|title=Verve Energy Media release - Exciting find of rare assassins spider found on WA South Coast|year=2008|accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref>

== Flora ==

The park is home to a range of habitats including [[Karri]] forest, coastal [[heath]] and [[wetland]]s each of which support a diverse array of vegetation and plant species. The area around Lake William supports a dense [[sedge]] scrub and rare species such as ''[[Amperea volubilus]]'' and an unnamed species of ''[[Melaleuca]]''. The Albany Pitcher Plant, ''[[Cephalotus follicularis]]'', is also found in the park.<ref>{{cite AHD|9358|West Cape Howe Area|date=1991|accessdate=14 October 2010}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Facilities==

Due to the sandy nature of many of the tracks, much of the park is accessible only to [[Four-wheel drive]] vehicles, although other vehicles may reach the popular Shelley Beach where a campground is located.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parks.dpaw.wa.gov.au/site/shelley-beach|title=Department of Parks and Wildlife - Shelley Beach|year=2013|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref> Shelley Beach also has a look-out, toilet and [[Barbecue]] facilities as well as prime spaces for launching [[Hang-gliders]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parks.dpaw.wa.gov.au/park/west-cape-howe|title=Department of Parks and Wildlife - West Cape Howe|year=2013|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref> The near-by Golden Gates Beach is also a popular location for [[Surfing|surfers]].

Western Australia's long-distance walking trail, the [[Bibbulmun Track]] passes through the park. The park has many facilities for bushwalkers, with a {{convert|15|km}} return trip spur-trail from the track to Torbay Head and a boardwalk section of the track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rainbowcoast.com.au/areas/albany/westcapehowe.htm|title=Rainbow Coast WA - West Cape Howe |year=2009|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref> In the West of the park, there is an overnight shelter for walkers that sleeps 12-15 persons, named 'West Cape Howe Campsite'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bibbulmuntrack.org.au/trip-planner/track-sections/denmark-albany/|title=Bibbulmun Track Denmark-Albany Section|year=2013|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref>
