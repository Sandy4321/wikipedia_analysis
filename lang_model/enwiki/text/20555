'''Paul Wyatt Caraway''' (December 23, 1905 &ndash; December 13, 1985) was a [[United States Army]] [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] and the 3rd [[United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands#High Commissioners|High Commissioner]] of the [[United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands]]. He was the son of two influential Arkansas Senators, [[Hattie Caraway]] and [[Thaddeus Caraway]]. Caraway graduated from the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1929. He also graduated from [[Georgetown University]] with a law degree and taught law at West Point. He served on the General Staff for the [[United States Department of War]] before becoming deputy chief-of-staff to General [[Albert Coady Wedemeyer]] during [[World War II]]. He served in numerous other positions, including accompanying [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]] on a tour of Asia. Following the [[Korean War]], he became head of Army Research and Development. He never saw combat.

Caraway held major influence as High Commissioner during the 1960s. He brought a new sense of economic prosperity to the island chain, turning it from one of the poorest area of Japan to one of the wealthier in east Asia. He lowered electric prices and arrested several prominent banking figures for fraud, revamping the local banking industry in the process. Despite this, many [[Okinawa]]ns saw him as autocratic. He refused to allow any increase in self-rule or autonomy, vetoing any bill from the local legislature that brought the islands closer to Japan and crushing autonomy movements. He resisted reform efforts from [[United States Ambassador to Japan|Ambassador to Japan]] [[Edwin O. Reischauer]] and [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]. He resigned from the office and the military in August 1964.

==Tenure as High Commissioner==
Caraway served as [[United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands#High Commissioners|High Commissioner]] of the [[United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands]] from February 16, 1961 to July 31, 1964. When Caraway arrived on the island, he wore the three-star insignia of a lieutenant general, despite the fact that the [[United States Senate]] had not yet approved his promotion to that rank. However, he felt that his need to establish immediate authority with the Okinawa public warranted his assumption of advancement; the Senate did not learn of this episode and confirmed him shortly thereafter.<ref name=vs/>

While Commissioner, Caraway considered [[Okinawa]] an essential area of United States military control that provided defense against [[China]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Eunson|first=Robert|title=Okinawa is Important Nuclear Base|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=79hNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=w4oDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7400,2737177&dq=paul-caraway&hl=en|accessdate=14 July 2011|newspaper=[[The Free Lance<U+2013>Star]]|date=30 April 1964|agency=The Free Lance<U+2013>Star Publishing Company|location=[[Fredericksburg, Virginia]]|page=12}}</ref> He further considered the occupation to be a positive force for Okinawa. The economy of the island grew under his governing, and he believed that a return of the island to Japan would result in authoritarian rule and discrimination against the natives. He viewed Ryukyu politicians as able but did not view them as equals in authority.<ref name=vs/>

Caraway ordered the lowering of [[electricity pricing|electricity rates]] and reformed the island banking system after having a number of prominent bankers arrested on charges of [[fraud]]. Before the war the Ryukyus had the lowest [[per capita income]] of all Japanese provinces; under Caraway, the island enjoyed one of the highest per capita incomes in all of [[Asia]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Grubnick|first=David|title=Growing Wages and Diversions in Ryukyus Reflect Aid of U.S.|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=13 January 1964|agency=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|pages=40}}</ref> Though he brought economic prosperity, many Okinawans and Japanese accused him of autocracy.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chapin|first=Emerson|title=Vow on Autonomy Given to Ryukyus|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=31 July 1964|agency=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|page=2}}</ref> He squelched a local autonomy movement, earning him criticism from the leftist movement and praise from local businessman.<ref>{{cite news|last=[[Associated Press]]|title=Caraway Backed by Businessmen on Okinawa|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FuscAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rmUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6666,4591742&dq=paul-caraway&hl=en|accessdate=14 July 2011|newspaper=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]|date=17 March 1963|agency=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[Sarasota, Florida]]|page=73}}</ref> He also combated and repressed any movements in favor of reverting the islands to Japanese rule.<ref>{{cite book|title=Public Diplomacy and Political Change: Four Case Studies: Okinawa, Peru, Czechoslovakia, Guinea|year=1973|publisher=[[Praeger Publishers]]|location=[[New York City]]|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8X_3k6saECcC&pg=PA146&dq=%22Paul+W+Caraway%22&hl=en&ei=dTAJTv3sF8uDtge6-OF4&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=caraway&f=false|editor=Gregory Henderson|accessdate=30 July 2011|page=46}}</ref> He vetoed bills from the Ryukyu legislature that would have brought the island closer to Japan, replacing them with directives distancing it.

Kennedy]] began an effort to give the residents of the Ryukyu islands. On of his methods was to restrict Caraway's power of veto by allowing him to overrule the Ryukyu Legislature only when necessary to protect the security interests of the United States.<ref>{{cite news|last=[[Associated Press]]|title=Kennedy Limits Military Rule over Ryukyu Islands|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GaFWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hecDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6805,1340280&dq=paul-caraway&hl=en|accessdate=30 July 2011|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|date=19 March 1962|agency=[[Cowles Publishing Company]]|location=[[Spokane, Washington]]|page=38}}</ref>
