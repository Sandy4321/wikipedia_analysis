It is {{convert|1.9|mi|km|1}} east of Rochdale's town centre, {{convert|10.4|mi|km|1}} north-northeast of the city of [[Manchester]], and spans across urban, suburban and rural locations<U+2014>from [[Windy Hill (Pennines)|Windy Hill]] in the east through to the [[Rochdale Canal]] in the west. Milnrow includes the villages of [[Tunshill]] and [[Newhey]],<ref name="RMBC32">Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council (N.D.), p.&nbsp;32.</ref> and is adjacent to junction 21 of the [[M62 motorway]].
 
[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] a part of [[Lancashire]], Milnrow during the [[Middle Ages]] was a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] located within the [[Butterworth (ancient township)|township of Butterworth]] and [[Rochdale (ancient parish)|parish of Rochdale]]. It was named by the [[Anglo-Saxons]], but the [[Norman conquest of England]] resulted in its ownership by minor [[Normans|Norman]] families, such as the Schofields and Cleggs. In the 15th century, the descendants of these families successfully agitated for a [[chapel of ease]] to be constructed in Milnrow by the banks of the River Beal, triggering its development as the main settlement in Butterworth. Despite this distinction, Milnrow did not increase much further in size or population until the dawn of the [[woollen]] trade in the [[Late Middle Ages]]. 

To supplement their income, the inhabitants of Milnrow entered the [[domestic system]], producing [[flannel]] and woollen cloth in purpose-built [[weavers' cottage]]s, some of which from the [[Early Modern Britain|Early Modern period]] have survived as [[listed building]]s.<ref>Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;149.</ref> Coalmining and metalworking also flourished in this period, but the [[Industrial Revolution]] supplanted the domestic industries and converted Milnrow into an urban [[mill town]] that mass-produced textile goods in [[cotton mill]]s, such as [[Ellenroad Ring Mill Engine|Ellenroad Ring Mill]] (now a museum). The [[Milnrow Urban District]] was established in 1894 and was governed thereafter by its own district council until its abolition in 1974.

Milnrow has been described as "the centre of the south Lancashire dialect".<ref>Joyce (1993), p.&nbsp;198.</ref> [[John Collier (caricaturist)|John Collier]] (who wrote under the pseudonym of Tim Bobbin) was an acclaimed 18th-century caricaturist and satirical poet from Milnrow who wrote in a broad [[Lancashire dialect and accent|Lancashire dialect]]. Rochdale-born poet [[Edwin Waugh]] was influenced by Collier's work, and wrote an extensive account of Milnrow during the mid-19th century in a tribute to Collier.<ref name="Waugh"/> Although Milnrow's heavy textile industries declined during the mid-20th century, the town has continued to grow as a result of [[suburbanisation]], [[urban renewal]] and its immediate proximity to road, rail and motorway networks.

[[Image:River Beal from Milnrow Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|The [[River Beal]] flowing through Milnrow, and by its banks, former [[weavers' cottage]]s. Handloom weaving of [[woollen]]s was Milnrow's historic staple industry.]]

The name Milnrow is derived from [[Old English]],<ref name=miln1/> but its meaning has not been deciphered with any certainty. The name may be a corruption of an old pronunciation of "Millner Howe", a water driven [[Gristmill|corn mill]] at a place called Mill Hill on the [[River Beal]] that was mentioned in deeds dating from 1568.<ref name="RMBC32"/><ref name="Hignett2"/><ref name="Ekwall"/> Another explanation is that it means a "mill with a row of houses", combining the Old English elements ''myne'' and ''raw''.<ref name=miln1/> Others have suggested that the name "Milnrow" is derived from a local family with the surname Milne, who owned a row of houses in the locality. A map from 1292 shows "Milnehouses" at Milnrow's present location, other spellings have included "Mylnerowe" (1545) and "Milneraw" (1577).<ref name="Hignett2"/><ref name="Ekwall">Ekwall (1972), p.&nbsp;56.</ref> 

Milnrow emerged as a settlement after the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066; the [[Normans|Norman]] families of "de Butterworths", "de Turnaghs", "de Schofields", "de Birchinleghs", "de Wylds" and "Cleggs" controlled the lands which formed the [[Butterworth (ancient township)|township of Butterworth]] from which Milnrow evolved as its main settlement.<ref name="Hignett2">Hignett (1991), p.&nbsp;2.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|author=[[Manchester City Council]]|url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/m_display.php?irn=240&sub=nwcotton&theme=places&crumb=Rochdale|publisher=spinningtheweb.org.uk|date=|accessdate=2008-04-20|title=Rochdale Towns}}</ref> In addition to the [[chapelry]] of Milnrow, Butterworth encompassed the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlets]] of Clegg, Wildhouse, Belfield, Butterworth Hall, Lowhouse, [[Newhey]], Ogden, [[Tunshill]], Haughs, and Bleaked-gate-cum-Roughbank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp?text_id=845610&word=NULL|title=Descriptive Gazetteer entry for Butterworth|publisher=visionofbritain.org.uk|accessdate=2008-04-22}}</ref> Butterworth was linked, ecclesiastically, with the [[Rochdale (ancient parish)|parish of Rochdale]].

Lying within the [[Historic counties of England|historic county boundaries]] of [[Lancashire]] since the early 12th century, Milnrow was a [[chapelry]] and component area of [[Butterworth (ancient township)|Butterworth]], an ancient [[Township (England)|township]] within the [[Rochdale (ancient parish)|parish of Rochdale]] and [[Salford (hundred)|hundred of Salford]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> Under [[feudalism]], Butterworth was governed by a number of ruling families, including the [[Baron Byron|Byrons]], who obtained the title of [[Lord of the Manor|Lords of the Manor]].<ref name="Hignett32"/> Throughout the [[Late Middle Ages]], local men acted as [[jurors]] and [[constables]] for the purposes of upholding law and order in Butterworth. Butterworth in the 19th century constituted a [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]], until its dissolution in 1894.<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/>

Milnrow's first [[local authority]] was a [[Local board of health]] established in 1870.<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> Milnrow Local Board of Health was a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation in the [[wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] of Belfield, Haugh and Milnrow.<ref name=fish122/> In 1879, a part of [[Castleton, Greater Manchester|Castleton]] and another part of Butterworth were included in the area of the Local board. Under the [[Local Government Act 1894]], the area of the local board broadly became the [[Milnrow Urban District]], a local government district in the Rochdale [[Poor Law Union]] and [[Administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of Lancashire.<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> Under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the Milnrow Urban District was abolished, and Milnrow has, since 1 April 1974, formed an [[unparished area]] of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale]], within the [[metropolitan county]] of [[Greater Manchester]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> In anticipation of the new local government arrangement, Milnrow Urban District Council applied for [[successor parish]] status to be granted to the locality after 1974, but the application was not successful.<ref>{{Harvnb|Clark|1973|p=106.}}</ref> 

From 1983 to 1997, Milnrow was represented in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] as part of the [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|parliamentary constituency]] of [[Littleborough and Saddleworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Littleborough and Saddleworth]].

In 1855, the poet [[Edwin Waugh]] said of Milnow:{{quote|Milnrow lies on the ground not unlike a tall tree laid lengthwise, in a valley, by a riverside.

Surrounded by open moor and grassland on its northern and eastern sides, Milnrow forms a continuous urban area with neighbouring Rochdale to the west, and, according to the [[Office for National Statistics]], is part of the [[Greater Manchester Urban Area]], the United Kingdom's third largest conurbation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/census2001/ks_urban_north_part_5.pdf|format=PDF| title=Census 2001:Key Statistics for urban areas in the North; Map 3|author=[[Office for National Statistics]]|publisher=statistics.gov.uk|accessdate=2008-04-22|year=2001}}</ref>

There are a number of small named-places in and around Milnrow, including Clegg, Firgrove, Gallows, Haugh, Newhey, Kitcliffe, Ogden, and [[Tunshill]]. [[Newhey]], at the south of Milnrow by [[Shaw and Crompton]], is the most distinct of these areas, and, with its own [[parish church]] and railway station, is invariably given as a separate village.
