'''Christian Charles Philip Bale''' (born [[January 30]], [[1974]]) (also known professionally as '''Christian Morgan Bale''') is a British actor. He is best known for his roles as [[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]] [[Patrick Bateman]], [[John Preston (character)|Grammaton Cleric John Preston]], and the masked [[vigilante]] [[Batman]]. Bale is also known for his versatility as an actor, including mimicking [[accent (linguistics)|accent]]s, harsh regimens of shedding and gaining weight (particularly for ''[[The Machinist]]'' and ''[[Batman Begins]]''), and generally inhabiting the characters he plays. Before he found success in playing Batman, he was heavily involved in [[independent film]].

Bale first caught the public eye when he was cast in the starring role of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Empire of the Sun]]'' at the age of 13, playing a British boy who becomes separated from his parents and subsequently find himself in a [[Japan|Japanese]] internment camp during [[World War II]]. Since then, he has portrayed a wide range of characters. Bale is especially noted for his [[cult figure|cult following]]. The tenth anniversary issue of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' hailed him as one of the "Top 8 Most Powerful Cult Figures of the Past Decade", citing his impressive cult status on the [[Internet]].<ref>Wilson, Cintra.

==Early life==
Christian Bale was born in [[Haverfordwest]], [[Pembrokeshire]], [[Wales|Wales]], the youngest of four children, to [[England|English]] parents, the [[businessperson|businessman]] [[David Bale]] and [[circus]] performer Jenny James.  Bale spent his childhood in several countries including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Portugal]], and the [[United States]].<ref name="Wills">Wills, Dominic.

Having a mother who made her living at a circus was an interesting experience for him; he recalled receiving his first kiss from an [[acrobat]] named Barta.<ref name="Wills" /> As a child, he trained in [[ballet]] and on the [[guitar]].<ref name="Wills" /> His sister Louise's work in theatre also influenced his decision to become an actor.<ref name="Wills" /> Bale's family settled for four years in [[Bournemouth]], where he attended the Bournemouth School for Boys and participated actively in [[Rugby union|rugby]].<ref name="Wills" />

Bale<U+2019>s first foray into acting was a [[Downy|Lenor]] [[television commercial|commercial]] in 1982, when he was 8.<ref name="Hotdog"> Hotdog.

==Career==
[[Image:Empire of the Sun.jpg|thumb|260px|13-year-old Bale with [[Nigel Havers]] in ''[[Empire of the Sun]]'' (1987).]]
He made his film debut as [[Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia]] in the [[television movie|made-for-television]] film ''Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna'' in [[1986 in film|1986]], which was followed by leading roles in the [[miniseries]] ''Heart of the Country'' and the [[fantasy film|fantasy]] [[adventure film|adventure]] ''[[Mio in the Land of Faraway]]'', in which he appeared for the first time with [[Christopher Lee]].

In [[1987 in film|1987]],  [[Amy Irving]], his co-star in ''Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna'', recommended Bale to her husband, [[Steven Spielberg]], for a role in ''[[Empire of the Sun]]'', adapted from the [[J.G. Ballard]] semi-[[autobiography]].<ref name="Wills" /> Bale's performance as James Graham earned him widespread critical praise and the first ever "Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor" award from the [[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]] (the Board created the award for him). The attention the press and his schoolmates lavished upon him after this took a toll on Bale, and he contemplated giving up acting, until [[Kenneth Branagh]] approached him, and persuaded him to appear in ''[[Henry V (1989 film)|Henry V]]'' in [[1989 in film|1989]].<ref name="Hotdog" />

===1990s===
He starred with [[Charlton Heston]], [[Oliver Reed]] and [[Christopher Lee]] in a television adaptation of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]<U+2019>s ''[[Treasure Island]]'', in [[1990 in film|1990]] and the following year, he starred in the television adaptation of [[John le Carr<U+00E9>]]<U+2019>s ''[[A Murder of Quality]]''.
[[Image:Bale_cowboyjack.jpg|thumb|left|Bale as<br> Jack "Cowboy" Kelly in 1992's ''[[Newsies]]''.]]
His next cinema performance was in the lead role in ''[[Newsies]]'', a [[family film|family]] [[musical film|musical]] based on [[The Newsboys Strike]] of the 1890s. For this role, Bale trained for ten weeks in [[dance|dancing]] and [[martial art|martial arts]].<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0512/29/sbt.01.html <U+201C>Showbiz Tonight<U+201D>] [[CNN|CNN.com]], [[December 29]], [[2005]], retrieved on [[May 16]], [[2006]].</ref>  ''Newsies'' was completely unprofitable for [[Walt Disney Pictures]], costing US$15,000,000 to produce and earning just shy of US$3,000,000, and it was nominated for "Worst Picture" at the [[1992 Golden Raspberry Awards]].

Bale next starred in ''[[Swing Kids (film)|Swing Kids]]'', a film about [[swing music]] in [[Nazi Germany]] as [[counterculture]], and a retelling of ''[[Hamlet]]'' entitled ''Prince of Jutland'', but neither of these films were well received.  

He was selected by [[Winona Ryder]] for a part in the [[Little Women (1994 film)|1994 adaptation]] of [[Louisa May Alcott]]<U+2019>s ''[[Little Women]]''. The film was warmly received by critics, and was a considerable success at the [[box office]]. The critic, James Berardinelli noted that Bale, "after a couple of extremely weak performances [in ''Newsies'' and ''Swing Kids''], finally displays some recognizable talent."<ref>Berardinelli, James. [http://movie-reviews.colossus.net/movies/l/little_women.html "Little Women"] ''ReelViews'', 1994, retrieved on [[June 4], [[2006]].</ref> Subsequently, Bale [[voice actor|voiced]] the character of Thomas in the [[1995 in film|1995]] [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Disney]] [[animated film]] ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]''. Thomas was an ally to [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]] in ''Pocahontas'', a characterization Bale would later defy in ''[[The New World]]'' where he would play tobacconist [[John Rolfe]], Smith<U+2019>s rival for Pocahontas<U+2019> affections.

He had minor parts in [[1996 in film|1996]]<U+2019>s ''[[The Secret Agent]]'' and ''[[The Portrait of a Lady]]'' before taking on his fifth lead role in ''Metroland'' as Chris, a young family man whose suppressed hellion lifestyle was re-incited by the resurgence of an old flame, forcing him to seriously consider keeping his present idyllic lifestyle or reverting to his carefree, hedonistic ways. ''Metroland'' received mixed reviews; Bale<U+2019>s performance polarized critics, some praising it<ref> Sanford, James.

[[Image:Arthurblue.jpg|thumb|250px|Bale as Arthur Stuart in ''[[Velvet Goldmine]]'' (1998).]]
In [[1998 in film|1998]], Bale starred with [[Jonathan Rhys-Meyers]] and [[Ewan McGregor]] in ''[[Velvet Goldmine]]'', a film based on [[David Bowie]]<U+2019>s [[concept album]], ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. Rhys-Meyers made his feature debut as Brian Slade, an over-the-top [[glam rock]] icon, and Bale played Arthur Stuart, a  [[journalist]] who reflected on his own past while researching Slade intensively for an article. Despite the subtler nature of his role compared to Rhys-Meyers and McGregor<U+2019>s, Bale was commended for his expressiveness.<ref>Edelstein, David.

In ''[[All the Little Animals]]'' (1998), Bale portrayed Bobby Platt, a [[mental retardation|mentally impaired]] young man fleeing from home to escape an irascible, abusive stepfather, who took his resentment for Bobby out on Bobby<U+2019>s pets, killing them one by one. Bale shared the screen with [[John Hurt]], whose character, a kindly old recluse, shared the same fondness for animals (and even insects) and forged a friendship with Bobby. The British production was helmed by first-time [[film director|director]] [[Jeremy Thomas]], known for producing a number of [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] films. It was praised by the likes of [[Roger Ebert]]<ref>Ebert, Roger. [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990903/REVIEWS/909030301/1023 <U+201C>All The Little Animals<U+201D>] ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[September 3]], [[1999]], retrieved on [[May 15]], [[2006]].</ref> and [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]]<ref>Rosenbaum, Jonathan.

Bale went on to play [[Demetrius]] in the [[1999 in film|1999]] [[Michael Hoffman]]-directed adaptation of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', which moved the time period to a more contemporary [[19th century]] and changed the location from [[Greece]] to [[Tuscany]]. Bale<U+2019>s co-stars included [[Kevin Kline]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Rupert Everett]], [[Stanley Tucci]], [[Calista Flockhart]], [[Dominic West]], [[Anna Friel]], [[David Strathairn]], and [[Sophie Marceau]]. The film opened to varied critical response but was fairly well-received by the public, taking in over US$16,000,000 in earnings while costing $11,000,000 to produce. Of Bale<U+2019>s performance, [[David Edelstein]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' acknowledged that while it was credible, he believed Bale to be <U+201C>more at home in naturalistic parts.<U+201D><ref>Edelstein, David.

===2000s===
[[Image:Batemanas.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Bale in ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]'' (2000), as [[Patrick Bateman]].]]
In 1999, Bale prepared to undertake what would arguably be his most acclaimed role. Director [[Mary Harron]], who had previously helmed the [[Valerie Solanas]] [[biographical film|biopic]] ''[[I Shot Andy Warhol]]'', was given the reins to the adaptation of [[Bret Easton Ellis]]<U+2019> controversial novel, ''[[American Psycho]]'', but dropped out of the project when she learned [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] was set to star instead of Bale, her first choice. Harron cited budget concerns, believing DiCaprio to be too expensive for the production.<ref name="Ebner" /> [[Oliver Stone]] replaced Harron as director, but when DiCaprio abandoned the project for ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]'', Stone left as well, and a pregnant Harron<ref name="Kaufman">Kaufman, Anthony.

Bale played [[Patrick Bateman]], the [[title role|title character]] of the novel and film. Bale had never read the novel before being contacted about the film, but took on the role because he was surprised and humoured by the [[screenplay|script]], which he described as <U+201C>the opposite of anything I<U+2019>d ever done before.<U+201D><ref name="Ebner"/> Harron<U+2019>s decision to cast Bale lay in that she thought he resembled a male [[Lili Taylor]] <U+201C>in the sense that there was a lot below the surface,<U+201D> and that <U+201C>he had a sense of mystery and depth in his face.<U+201D><ref name="Ebner"/>

The film diverged from the novel in some instances, but was generally faithful. Bateman was, on the outward, a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] [[yuppie]], but underneath the public image he had created for himself he was actually a [[murder|murderous]] [[psychopath]]. Bale researched Bateman by studying the novel.<ref name="Ebner"/> He prepared himself physically for the role by spending months [[sun tanning|tanning]] and [[exercise|exercising]] rigorously in order to achieve Bateman<U+2019>s [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] physique,<ref>Fischer, Paul. [http://www.crankycritic.com/qa/pf_articles/christianbale.html Unmasking an American Psycho] ''The Cranky Critic'', retrieved on [[May 15]], [[2006]].</ref> even going so far as to distance himself from the cast and crew in order to preserve the darker side of Bateman<U+2019>s character.<ref>Rubinstein, Julian.

On [[April 14]], [[2000]], [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lions Gate Film]] finally released ''American Psycho'' in theatres. The film<U+2019>s overall budget and marketing costs amounted to US$17,000,000. It made a tidy worldwide profit of US$34,266,564. More importantly, it strengthened Bale<U+2019>s reputation as a committed and capable actor, and further cemented his cult status. Bale was approached to make a [[cameo appearance]] in another Bret Easton Ellis adaptation, ''[[The Rules of Attraction (film)|The Rules of Attraction]]'', which was loosely connected to ''American Psycho''. He declined out of loyalty to Mary Harron<U+2019>s vision of Bateman, which he felt could not be properly expressed by anyone else.<ref name="Morris">Morris, Clint. [http://www.moviehole.net/news/201.html <U+201C>Interview: Christian Bale] ''Moviehole'', retrieved on [[May 16]], [[2006]]</ref>

In the [[2000 in film|2000]] [[Shaft (2000 film)|sequel]] to [[1971 in film|1971]]'s ''[[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]]'', Bale played a villainous character similar to Patrick Bateman, an unhinged [[racism|racist]] yuppie named Walter Wade, Jr., a decision which generated observations about the two roles being too alike. Bale acknowledged that perhaps taking on such a similar role so soon was a possible mistake on his part. <ref name="McCormick"/>

Sure enough, Bale played an assortment of diverse characters from [[2001 in film|2001]] onwards. His first role after ''American Psycho'' was in the [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] adaptation of the best-selling novel ''[[Captain Corelli's Mandolin]]'', which was a significant departure from the novel. Bale played Mandras, a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[fisherman]] who vied with [[Nicolas Cage]]<U+2019>s title character for the affections of the desirable Pelagia ([[Penelope Cruz]]). The Mandras of the novel was a more developed character with his own subplot; Bale<U+2019>s Mandras was relegated to a supporting character, and his subplot was eliminated, much of the camera being devoted to Corelli and Pelagia. ''Captain Corelli<U+2019>s Mandolin'' was Bale<U+2019>s second time working with John Hurt, after ''All the Little Animals''.

[[2002 in film|2002]] was a busy and disappointing year for Bale. He starred in three feature films, none of which were successful at the box office. ''[[Laurel Canyon (film)|Laurel Canyon]]'' (2002), an independent film about love and longing, divided critics. The film<U+2019>s script and the director<U+2019>s ego were questioned, but critics, by and large, agreed that [[Frances McDormand]] outshone the rest of the cast, including Bale.<ref>[http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/laurelcanyon <U+201C>Laurel Canyon<U+201D>], ''[[Metacritic]]'', retrieved on [[May 17]], [[2006]].</ref>
[[Image:Bale_preston.jpg|left|thumb|160px|Bale as [[John Preston (character)|Cleric John Preston]] in ''[[Equilibrium (2002 film)|Equilibrium]]'' (2002).]]

''[[Reign of Fire]]'' was Bale<U+2019>s first [[action movie|action]] [[star vehicle|vehicle]]. It had an immense budget (over US$90,000,000) compared to all his previous work. The film<U+2019>s plot involved a fire-breathing [[dragon]] that had been awakened from [[hibernation]], bringing with it thousands more that threatened the world. Bale entered into negotiations about starring in the film with reservations, but director [[Rob Bowman]] convinced him to take the lead role.<ref name="Chavel">Chavel, Sean.

''[[Equilibrium (2002 film)|Equilibrium]]'' was Bale<U+2019>s third film of 2002 and it landed a potentially severe blow to his career, costing US$20,000,000 to produce but earning just over US$5,000,000 worldwide. [[Dimension Films]] never issued ''Equilibrium'' a wide release, lacking faith in promoting it. Nevertheless, it gained a cult following that grew so large director [[Kurt Wimmer]] was granted a US$30,000,000 budget to direct ''[[Ultraviolet (film)|Ultraviolet]]''. Bale played [[John Preston (character)|John Preston]], an elite lawman in a [[dystopian]], [[post-apocalyptic]] society. ''Equilibrium'' featured a fictional martial art called [[Gun Kata]]<U+2014>inspired by ''[[The Matrix]]'' and [[John Woo]]<U+2019>s films<U+2014>that combined [[firearm|gunfighting]] with [[hand-to-hand combat]]. Preston was a master of Gun Kata, which made him a particularly memorable protagonist. Preston<U+2019>s [[fandom|fanbase]] was so strong a number of them banded together to develop a [[mod (computer gaming)#Total conversion|total conversion mod]] for the [[computer game]] ''[[Max Payne 2]]'' dubbed ''Hall of Mirrors''.<ref>[http://hom.paynereactor.com/ "Hall of Mirrors"], retrieved on [[June 4]], [[2006]].</ref>

After a year<U+2019>s hiatus, Bale returned in [[2004 in film|2004]] to play Trevor Reznik, the title character in the [[psychological thriller]] ''[[The Machinist]]''. Reznik was an [[insomnia|insomniac]], tormented by a mysterious stalker. Bale devoted himself to the role to an extent he had never gone to, sacrificing his mental and physical well being to achieve Reznik<U+2019>s skeletal appearance for the sake of an authentic, naturalistic performance. (In one scene, [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]<U+2019>s character quipped, <U+201C>If you were any thinner, you wouldn<U+2019>t exist.<U+201D>) He went without proper rest for prolonged periods, and placed himself on a [[crash diet]] that saw his weight dropping by a startling sixty pounds in a matter of months.<ref name="IGN">Gilchrist, Todd.

It was given only a limited U.S. release and made most of its profits overseas.
[[Image:BaleMachine.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Bale lost more than 60 pounds for his role in ''[[The Machinist]]'' (2004).]] 
Bale, an admirer of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Spirited Away]]'',<ref name="Morris" /> was cast as the voice of the title character, [[Wizard Howl|Howl]], in the [[English language]] [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] of the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] director's [[fantasy film|fantasy]] [[anime]] [[adventure film|adventure]] ''[[Howl's Moving Castle]]'', an adaptation of [[Diana Wynne Jones]]<U+2019> [[Howl's Moving Castle|children's novel]]. Its profits in the United States made up a mere US$4,711,096 in of its staggering worldwide gross (US$230,458,788). Bale<U+2019>s Howl, a wizard who lived in a spectacular walking castle, was debonair, princely and ostentatious, a quality shared with one half of Bale<U+2019>s next role.

Bale was cast as one of the two leads in the [[South Los Angeles|South Central]] [[David Ayer]]-hemled crime drama ''[[Harsh Times]]'', co-starring with [[Freddy Rodriguez]]. Bale played Jim David, a grim [[Gulf War]] veteran afflicted with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], inexplicably approached by the [[Department of Homeland Security]] and hired as a federal agent. ''[[Harsh Times]]'' premiered at the [[2005 Toronto International Film Festival]] and is slated for wide release on [[September 8]], [[2006]].

[[Terrence Malick]] directed ''[[The New World]]'', a [[period piece]] inspired by the stories of [[Pocahontas]], and Bale was cast as [[John Rolfe]], his second time participating in a [[dramatization]] of Pocahontas. He shared the screen with [[Colin Farrell]] and [[Q'Orianka Kilcher]], who played lovers [[John Smith]] and Pocahontas. The majority of screen time was devoted to Farrell and Kilcher; Bale was a secondary character, and only appeared during the last third. ''The New World'' left critics to contend whether its indulgence and the dramatic liberties it took over historical accuracy made the film a champion or a dud. Opinions were extremely divided. Filmgoers were uninterested. 'The film was a failure at the U.S. box office and its worldwide total (US$29,506,437) fell just short of turning a profit (the production budget was placed at US$30,000,000).

Bale has a trio of projects lined up for [[2006 in film|2006]]. ''[[Rescue Dawn]]'' by [[German people|German]] filmmaker [[Werner Herzog]] will have him playing a U.S. [[Fighter aircraft|Fighter]] [[aviator|pilot]] who has to fight  for his life after being shot down while on a mission during the [[Vietnam War]]. Bale left a strong impression on Herzog, with the director complimenting his acting abilities: "I find him one of the greatest talents of his generation. We made up our own minds long before he did Batman."<ref>[http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/entertainment/156062004.htm <U+201C>Herzog Hails Bale<U+201D>] ''Female First'', [[March 24]], [[2006]], retrieved on [[May 17]], [[2006]].</ref> In ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'', an adaptation of the [[Christopher Priest]] [[The Prestige|novel]] about a rivalry between two [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[magic (illusion)|stage magicians]], Bale reunites with Michael Caine and Christopher Nolan, who is directing the film. ''The Prestige<U+2019>s'' cast also includes [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Piper Perabo]], and [[David Bowie]]. ''[[I'm Not There]]'', a film that sees Bale working again with Colin Farrell, is an artistic reflection of the life of [[Bob Dylan]], and also includes [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Richard Gere]], [[Julianne Moore]], and [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]] as part of the cast.

====Batman====
[[Image:BBBale.jpg|right|thumb|180px|After ''The Machinist'', Bale regained his original weight plus 20 pounds more for ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005).]]
Bale had long been a contender to portray [[Batman]], from as early as 2002. Earlier on, he had auditioned for the role of [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] in ''[[Batman Forever]]'', but lost out to [[Chris O'Donnell]].<ref name="notstarring">[http://www.notstarring.com/actors/bale-christian/ "Christian Bale"] ''Not Starring'', retrieved on [[May 18]], [[2006]].</ref> In 2004, after completing filming for ''The Machinist'', Bale won the coveted role and was set to star with the predominantly British cast of [[Liam Neeson]], [[Katie Holmes]], [[Michael Caine]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Tom Wilkinson]], [[Gary Oldman]] and [[Cillian Murphy]] in the [[Christopher Nolan]]-helmed ''[[Batman Begins]]'', a complete restart of the Batman mythos without any ties to the [[Tim Burton|Burton]] or [[Joel Schumacher|Schumacher]] visions. Bale beat out [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], the closest competition.<ref>Otto, Jeff. [http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/495/495335p1.html <U+201C>David S. Goyer Talks Batman, Iron Man, Comics and More<U+201D>] [[IGN]] ''FilmForce'', [[February 27]], [[2004]], retrieved on [[May 16]], [[2006]].</ref> (Evening the score, Bale lost the part of [[Anthony Swofford]] in ''[[Jarhead (film)|Jarhead]]'' to Gyllenhaal.<ref name="notstarring"/>) Still fresh from ''The Machinist'', it became necessary for Bale to bulk up to match the powerful physique of Batman. He was given a deadline of six months to do this. Bale recalled it as far from a simple accomplishment: <U+201C><U+2026>when it actually came to building muscle, I was useless. I couldn<U+2019>t do one push up the first day. All of the muscles were gone, so I had a real tough time rebuilding all of that.<U+201D><ref name="IGN" /> With the help of a [[personal trainer]], Bale succeeded in meeting the deadline, gaining exactly one hundred pounds in six months. He then worked toward converting most of it into muscle.<ref>Jordan, Sean.

Bale had initial concerns about playing Batman, as he felt more ridiculous than intimidating in the Batman costume. He dealt with this by depicting Batman as a savage beast in his portrayal.<ref name="IGN" /> To attain a deeper understanding of the character, Bale perused various Batman [[comic book]]s. He explained his interpretation of the Dark Knight: <U+201C>Batman is his hidden, demonic rage-filled side. The Batman creature [Wayne] creates is an absolutely sincere creature and one that he has to control but does so in a very haphazard way. He's capable of enacting violence <U+2013> and to kill <U+2013> so he's constantly having to rein himself in.<U+201D> For Bale, the most grueling part about playing Batman was the costume. <U+201C>You stick it on, you get hot, you sweat and you get a headache in the cowl,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>But I'm not going to bitch about it because I get to play Batman.<U+201D><ref>Dawson, Angela.

[[Image:Batman_Bale.jpg|left|thumb|Bale as [[Batman]] in ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005).]]
''Batman Begins'' was released domestically on [[June 15]], [[2005 in film|2005]] to wide critical, fan and public approval. Nolan was commended for choosing to film most of ''Begins'' more traditionally by opting for [[live action|live-action]] [[special effect|special effects]] whenever possible in an age where [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] was economical and believable. The cast was praised for its effective portrayals, but Bale drew the most acclaim for his dual portrayal of both Batman and Bruce Wayne, the superficial [[billionaire]] playboy [[alter ego]]. He earned the Best Hero award at the [[MTV Movie Awards 2006|2006 MTV Movie Awards]] for his performance.
<!-- There is a whole body of text that covers critical perception of Batman Begins that had to be taken out because it cut the entire article off at this point for some reason. I<U+2019>m attempting to fix the problem.-->

''Batman Begins'' was a domestic and international triumph for [[Warner Bros.]], costing approximately US$135,000,000 to produce and taking in over US$370,000,000 in returns worldwide. ''[[The Dark Knight (film) |The Dark Knight]]'', the sequel to ''Batman Begins'', is in production, with Bale set to reprise his role as Batman and [[Heath Ledger]] set to play his famous archnemesis [[The Joker]]. It is expected to complete filming sometime in [[2008 in film|2008]]. A [[Batman Begins (video game)|''Batman Begins'' video game]] was also developed for the [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox]], [[Game Boy Advance]], and [[PlayStation Portable]]; Bale provided the voice of Batman.

==Personal life==
On [[January 29]], [[2000]], Bale married [[independent film]] [[film producer|producer]] [[Sibi Blazic]] (formerly a [[model (person)|model]], [[makeup artist]], and personal [[assistant]] of [[Winona Ryder]]). He now lives with her in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Together they have a daughter who was born on [[March 27]], [[2005]] in [[Santa Monica, California]]. Bale, notoriously private, has not publicly divulged her name. He reportedly name her Emmaline.<ref>[http://www.celebritywonder.com/html/christianbale.html "PROFILE"] ''Celebrity Wonder'', retrieved on [[June 4]], [[2006]].</ref>

Bale has three older sisters &ndash; Erin Bale, a [[musician]]; Sharon Bale, a [[computer]] professional; and Louise Bale, a [[theatre]] [[actor|actress]] and [[theatre direction|director]]. The Bale family is deeply rooted in [[entertainment industry|showbusiness]], especially theatre. Bale is a distant relative of British actress [[Lillie Langtry]], while his uncle, Rex Bale, and maternal grandfather were actors as well.<ref name="Wills" />

Like his father, Bale is known as a [[conservationist]] and an animal lover, and is a supporter of conservation and [[animal welfare]] groups like [[Greenpeace]] and the [[WWF (conservation organization)|World Wildlife Fund]].<ref name="Hotdog" /> Bale gained the famous [[feminism|feminist]] [[activism|activist]] [[Gloria Steinem]] as a stepmother through his father<U+2019>s marriage to her on [[September 3]], [[2000]], before his death in [[2003]].<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/09/05/steinem.marriage.ap/ "Feminist icon Gloria Steinem first-time bride at 66], [[CNN]].com, [[September 5]], [[2000]], retrieved on [[May 26]], [[2006]].</ref>
