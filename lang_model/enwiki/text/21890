The '''BOK Center''' is an 18,041 seat, 550,000 square-foot, multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] currently under construction. The $183 million arena should be completed by [[2008]]. It will be home to the [[Tulsa Oilers]] [[ice hockey]] team and perhaps an [[arena football]] team. Ground was broken for the arena on [[August 31]], [[2005]].

Naming rights for the arena were recently purchased by the Bank of Oklahoma. The arena is currently one of the Tulsa area's Vision 2025 long-range planning projects. When completed its size would rival that of the [[Ford Center]] arena in [[Oklahoma City]] and the [[Alltel Arena]] in [[North Little Rock, Arkansas]]. Tulsa is one of many midwestern cities participating in the latest arena-building boom.

The arena was designed by the world famous [[architect]] [[C<U+00E9>sar Pelli]]. The arena is on budget, thanks to some corporate monies, in exchange for interior advertising.  One of the corporations involved is the Dollar-Thrifty Auto Group known to the public as Dollar Rent A Car and Thrifty Car Rental whos headquarters is in Tulsa as well. It is due to open in September, 2008. Other then the Tulsa Oilers ice hockey team there is numerous talk of an arena football team playing there as well and there is currently a bid for a possible NBA team to have pre season games as well as a trial. Tulsa Oklahoma is one of the fastest growing corporate headquarter cities in the nation and the arena is just another goal for Tulsa to rival cross state town Oklahoma City.
