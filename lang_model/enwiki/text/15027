'''Thomas Michael''' "'''Tom'''" '''Menino''' (born December 27, 1942) is the [[List of mayors of Boston, Massachusetts|mayor]] of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]] and the city's first [[Italian-American]] [[mayor]].  He is the longest-serving mayor in the history of the city.

==Biography==
Born in [[Readville]], a part of Boston's [[Hyde Park, Boston, Massachusetts|Hyde Park]] neighborhood, Menino was educated at [[Chamberlayne Junior College]] ([[Associate's degree|AA]], Business Management, 1963) and the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]], Community Planning, 1988).  He currently resides in Hyde Park with his wife, Angela Faletra. They have two children: Susan and Thomas Jr. He has relatives in Panama City Florida

===Boston City Hall===
Menino had served nine years on Boston's city council when [[Ray Flynn]] left the mayor's seat to become US ambassador to the Vatican. The council president at the time, Menino became acting mayor for four months before being elected to his first term in November 1993, defeating State Representative [[James Brett]] with 64% of the vote and becoming the city's first non-[[Irish-American]] mayor since 1930. After running unopposed for a second term in 1997, Menino defeated Boston City Councilor [[Peggy Davis-Mullen]] in 2001 for a third term with 76% of the vote<ref>http://www.cityofboston.gov/elections/search/</ref> and in 2005 garnered 67% of the vote in beating [[Maura Hennigan]], another councilor.<ref>http://www.cityofboston.gov/elections/currentelections/</ref> On July 13, 2009 Menino became the longest-serving mayor in Boston history. On November 3, 2009 Menino garnered 57% of the vote, defeating Boston City Councilor [[Michael F. Flaherty]] and securing an unprecedented fifth term.{{wikinews|Tom Menino wins historic fifth term as Mayor of Boston; plus results from area cities}}

===Health===
Menino has been hospitalized several times since taking office.  He has been admitted for abdominal pain and intestinal inflammation, and was treated for [[kidney stones]] in 1995 and 1997.  In 2003, Menino underwent surgery at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] to remove a rare [[sarcoma]] ([[Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans|DFSP]]) on his back.  The [[tumor]] had not spread, and the mayor was able to return to work in a matter of days.  In 2004, the mayor's doctors confirmed he has been diagnosed with [[Crohn's disease]], helping to explain his recurring intestinal problems.  The condition requires life-long treatment with anti-inflammatory medication and careful monitoring of his diet.<ref>http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2004/08/20/menino_confirms_crohn146s_diagnosis/</ref>

== Mayoralty ==
[[Image:Diaz&Menino.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Massachusetts Senate|Massachusetts State Senator]] [[Sonia Chang-D<U+00ED>az]] and [[List of mayors of Boston, Massachusetts|Mayor]] Thomas Menino]]
According to Mayor Menino<U+2019>s official biography, <U+201C>Among his main priorities, are: providing every child with a quality education; creating affordable housing; lowering the crime rate; revitalizing Boston's neighborhoods; and promoting a healthy lifestyle for all city residents.<U+201D>

===Construction===
In 2006, Menino proposed two major construction projects that would have a major impact on the city.  [[Trans National Place]] is a proposed {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} tower to be built on the site of a city-owned parking garage in Boston's [[Financial District, Boston|Financial District]]. The second proposal calls for the city to sell Boston's [[Government Center, Boston, Massachusetts|City Hall]], a 1960's example of [[Brutalism]] architecture. Menino would then have the city use the proceeds from the sale to fund construction of a new seat of government on the [[South Boston]] waterfront, on the site of the current [[Bank of America]] Pavilion (Drydock 4). As of early 2011, neither project had moved forward.

In March 2011, Menino proposed renovating the abandoned Ferdinand's Furniture building in the [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] neighborhood of Boston and relocating 400 Boston Public School employees from the School Department's headquarters at 26 Court Street, a block from Boston's [[Government Center, Boston, Massachusetts|City Hall]]. The "Ferdinand" building is a circa-1895, [[Baroque Revival]] structure located in the [[Dudley Square]] area of Roxbury. The renovation is estimated to cost $100<U+2013>115 million, an amount raised by issuing municipal bonds that would be paid back by selling or leasing five of the city's municipal buildings.<ref>http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/03/04/mayor_plans_partnership_to_revive_dudley_sq/</ref>

===Mayors Against Illegal Guns===
On April 25, 2006, Menino and [[New York City]] mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] hosted a summit at [[Gracie Mansion]] in New York City, during which the [[Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition]] was formed. The coalition, of which Menino remains co-chair, stated its goal of "making the public safer by getting illegal [[gun politics|guns]] off the streets." The initial group consisted of 15 mayors; the 15 drafted and signed a statement of principles<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mayorsagainstillegalguns.org/html/about/principles.shtml| title=Mayors Against Illegal Guns: Coalition Principles}} Retrieved on June 18, 2007</ref> and set a goal to expand their membership to 50 mayors by the end of 2006. That goal was met six months ahead of schedule, and led to its current membership of 210 mayors, with members from both major [[political parties]] and 40 states.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mayorsagainstillegalguns.org/html/about/members.shtml| title=Mayors Against Illegal Guns: Coalition Members}} Retrieved on June 18, 2007</ref>


===United States Conference of Mayors===
Menino was president of the [[United States Conference of Mayors]] from 2002 to 2003.


===DNC 2004===
Menino is famous for bringing the [[Democratic National Convention]] to Boston in [[DNC 2004|2004]]. Though controversial in the beginning for fundraising difficulties, security concerns, protests by unions, and inconvenience to residents, Menino estimates the convention generated $150 million in business for the city.  Meanwhile, other estimates suggest the convention generated $14.8 million for the city.<ref>[http://www.beaconhill.org/BHIFaxSheetDNCFinal08094.pdf The Economic Impact of the Democratic National Convention on the Boston Economy: The Final Tally], The Beacon Hill Institute.</ref>

==="Beantown" to "Greentown"===
In 2008, the City of Boston was ranked as the third greenest city in the US by [[Popular Science Magazine]].<ref>http://www.popsci.com/environment/article/2008-02/americas-50-greenest-cities?page=1</ref> In the last decade, there have been new initiatives around planting more trees in the city, [[single-stream recycling]], increasing the solar power capacity of the city, investing in alternative energy, and biking. One of the most innovative ideas has been green building zoning, which requires large-scale private construction to be <U+201C>green<U+201D> by [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] standards. Boston is the first city to revise its building code to ensure green construction.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/20/us/20boston.html</ref> The documentary ''The Greening of Southie'' by Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis tells the story of the first green residential building in Boston.<ref>http://www.greeningofsouthie.com/</ref>

The city has partnered with other government agencies and local businesses to accomplish its goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 7% below 1990 levels by 2012, and to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.

Controversially, in recent years the Menino administration has been looking into selling the City's second largest public park, [[Mary Cummings Park]] for development.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2005/08/18/city_may_tap_30s_gift_to_aid_greenway/|title=Commission urges sale of 218-acre trust to pay for park maintenance|accessdate=2005-08-18| work=The Boston Globe | date=August 18, 2005 | first1=Thomas C. | last1=Palmer Jr}}</ref> Part of this {{convert|210|acre|km2}} of public park land has been designated by the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] as a Priority Habitat for Rare Species.

===Cities Are Neighborhoods===
Menino is also known for focusing on neighborhood development in Boston, organizing services by neighborhood and appointing [http://www.cityofboston.gov/neighborhoods/ Neighborhood Coordinators] who serve as ambassadors from the City in their areas, believing that development should happen in every neighborhood. In 2001, [[Governing magazine]] named Mayor Menino Public Official of the Year for effective neighborhood development in Boston. This model has spread to other cities as a result of its effectiveness.<ref>http://www.usmayors.org/usmayornewspaper/documents/11_12_01/Menino.asp</ref>

===Boston Youth Council===
The Mayor's Youth Council, started in 1994,<ref>http://www.bostonyouthzone.com/myc/about.asp</ref> meets with Mayor Menino twice a month to discuss Youth based issues in the city of Boston.

===Boston Soda Ban===
In April 2011, in an effort to battle obesity, Menino banned the sale and advertising of sugar-loaded drinks from city-owned buildings and city-sponsored events.<ref>http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/uploads/5742_40_7_25.pdf</ref>

== Quotes ==
Mayor Menino is known for his distinctive voice and [[malapropisms]], leading some (such as conservative radio show host and author [[Howie Carr]]) to call him "Mumbles Menino"<ref name="mumbles">http://www.mumblesmenino.us/</ref><ref>[http://www.nerepublican.com/index.php/2004/03/ "Howie Carr on Flipper<U+2019>s 5 Mansions", ''N.E. Republican''].</ref> or "Mayor Mumbles".  Typical examples involve references to Boston's parking shortage as "an [[Alcatraz]] around my neck" (meaning, instead, an ''[[albatross (metaphor)|albatross]]'' around his neck) and referred to former mayor [[John F. Collins]] as "a man of great statue" rather than stature.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZl6fU6WgUw&feature=related</ref> On a public service announcement about prostate cancer, Menino said, "Together, we can defeat prostrate (sic) cancer." At least one website has been developed to document Menino's verbal gaffes.<ref name="mumbles"/>

In 2004 during the MLB playoffs at a rally for the Boston Red Sox Mayor Menino said: <U+201C>Much like a cookie, I predict the Yankee dynasty will crumble and the results will be delicious for Red Sox fans."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2005/10/04/postseason_a_clean_slate_for_red_sox/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Postseason a clean slate for Red Sox | date=October 4, 2005 | first1=Bob | last1=Hohler}}</ref>

During the 2004 presidential race, Menino was asked if he would run for [[John Kerry]]'s Senate seat should the Senator win, and responded "I will not be candidation nor I'll seek, but I'll accept a draft," an apparent attempt to evoke [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s famous quote, "I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president."<ref>http://www.mumblesmenino.us/mumbling.htm</ref>

During a ceremony honoring Boston Bruins hockey legend Bobby Orr, Menino mentioned a number of "ionic" Boston sports figures, including "[[Jason Varitek|Varitek]] splitting the uprights."  Jason Varitek is a member of baseball's Red Sox; Menino probably had Varitek confused with [[Adam Vinatieri]], the [[New England Patriots]] ''football'' kicker known for game winning kicks in [[Super Bowl XXXVI|Super Bowls XXXVI]] and [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|XXXVIII]].  Also, at a dedication ceremony at the Tobin Community Center in 2010 when the Boston Celtics were in the NBA Finals, he mispronounced NBA Commissioner David Stern's name as "Donald Sterns."

On October 11, 2011, explaining his decision to order the Boston Police Department to use force on peaceful Occupy Boston demonstrators, Menino said, "I simplify [sic] with their issues, some of those issues we really have to look at in America, but when it comes to civil disobedience I will not tolerate civil disobedience in the city of Boston." <ref>http://www.necn.com/10/11/11/Mayor-Menino-on-Occupy-Boston-arrests/landing_newengland.html?blockID=575486&feedID=8505</ref>

==Public Opinion==
Mayor Menino enjoys high approval ratings among residents of Boston.  An April, 2008 [[Boston Globe]]-[[University of New Hampshire|UNH]] poll indicated that the city was <U+201C>smitten<U+201D> with the Mayor, with a 72% approval rating. 54% reported having personally met the Mayor.<ref>http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/04/20/city_worried_about_crime_but_smitten_with_menino/ Smitten with Menino</ref>  While he is not without his critics, Menino's perennial popularity has garnered him the [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[epithet]] "Mayor for Life."<ref>[http://www.boston.com/business/globe/articles/2007/11/30/meninos_a_game/ ''Boston Globe'': Menino's A-game (November 30, 2007)]</ref><ref>[http://bostonist.com/2008/04/22/is_mr_smooth_me.php Is "Mr. Smooth" Menino Mayor for Life? ]</ref><ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2007/11/01/menino_and_the_accountability_gap/ ''Boston Globe'': Menino and the accountability gap (November 1, 2007)]</ref><ref>[http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/top/features/documents/02654652.htm ''Boston Phoenix'': Don't underestimate Mr. Pothole (January 16 - 23, 2003)]</ref><ref>[http://www.dotnews.com/citywide%20run.html ''Dorchester Reporter'': Potentials give '09 citywide run a look (July 31, 2008)]</ref><ref>[http://www.baywindows.com/index.php?ch=columnists&sc=pressing_the_flesh&id=79181 ''Bay Windows'': Catching up with Jarrett Barrios (Wednesday Aug 20, 2008)]</ref><ref>[http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/bostonpride/page4 Boston Magazine: 61 New Best Things about Boston]</ref>

==Controversies==
On [[April Fool's Day]] 1998, radio personalities [[Opie and Anthony]], who were on station [[WAAF (FM)|WAAF]] at the time, told their listeners Menino died in a fiery car accident while vacationing solo in Florida. Many believed the story, leading Menino to file a complaint with the [[Federal Communications Commission]], as the FCC prohibits the broadcast of knowingly false information if it causes public harm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/eb/broadcast/hoaxes.html|title=FCC hoax policy|accessdate=2007-12-01|year=2005}}</ref> WAAF suggested that the duo have pies thrown at them while being held in town square stocks. The idea was summarily dismissed by the mayor's office. Facing a possible license challenge, WAAF fired them, but Opie and Anthony promised that they would return to Boston and get revenge. During the early days of [[XM Satellite Radio|XM]] Anthony stated that the intent of the April Fool's prank was to allow the duo to be released from their contract with WAAF. He also stated that the duo had been having illicit meetings with WNEW before the April fools prank.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E4DA1231F930A25754C0A96E958260|title= On-Air Prank Earns Pair A Shot at Radio Big Time|accessdate=2007-12-01|publisher=New York Times|date=1998-08-13|author=Andrea Adelson}}</ref>

In 2001, Menino personally intervened to help stop a chain drugstore from opening a few blocks from a pharmacy owned by a close friend and political supporter.  The case raised questions about favoritism and the city's zoning practices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.roslindale.net/news/07.20.01Mayorblockspharm.html|title= Mayor's role in blocking pharmacy eyed|publisher=Boston Globe|date=2001-07-20|author=Brian C. Mooney and Stephanie Ebbert}}</ref>

In 1993 when running for mayor, Menino pledged to serve "only two terms, and that's it for me."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/10/27/menino_says_this_may_not_be_his_final_campaign/|title= Menino says this may not be his final campaign|publisher=Boston Globe|date=2005-10-27|author= Lisa Wangsness}}</ref>  In 2001, when Menino ran for a third term, he clarified "I promised I'd serve two terms - in every century."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archive/features/00/03/23/TALKING_POLITICS.html|title= Talking Politics|publisher=Boston Phoenix|date=2000-03-23|author=Seth Gitell}}</ref>

In 2008, the Friends of Mary Cummings Park delivered a complaint to the [[Massachusetts Attorney General]] alleging breach of charitable trust by the Menino administration which had sought to sell over 200 acres of public parkland for development.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cummingspark.org/20080723agcomplaint|title=Friends of Mary Cummings Park delivers complaint to the Mass. Attorney General Martha Coakley seeking an investigation of misallocation of care and maintenance trust funds, breach of charitable trust|date=2008-07-23}}</ref> According to the Boston Business Journal, Joe Timilty, "the former Boston city councilor and developer who spent time in prison for his part in a 1980s real estate deal gone bad", was among those interested in acquiring the land from the City. "Timilty at one point looked closely at the Route 128 land owned by Boston, hoping to build an upscale golf community featuring a green surrounded by luxury homes".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/1999/12/27/story1.html|title=Route 128 properties coveted by developers|date=1999-12-27|author=Scott Van Voorhis}}</ref>

In 2009, the Boston Globe printed an article alleging questionable behavior in Menino's mayoral campaign race.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/09/13/menino_runs_a_well_tuned_political_machine_powered_by_zeal/?page=full|title= A well-tuned political machine, powered by zeal|publisher=Boston Globe|date=2009-09-13|author=Stephanie Ebbert, Michael Levenson, and Donovan Slack}}</ref> The article reported several instances of questionable behavior, including more than one case of Menino's associates monitoring Michael F. Flaherty's Facebook affiliations. According to the article, the Menino campaign sent out a campaign memo containing the name of at least one small business owner who supported Flaherty.

In 2011, Menino's former mayoral opponent, [[Michael Flaherty]], alleged that his former running mate [[Sam Yoon]] had to leave Boston after running against Menino because the mayor's allies made it difficult for Yoon to find a job locally.<ref>http://digboston.com/think/2011/05/one-on-one-with-michael-flaherty/</ref>

Later in 2011, controversy arose surrounding Menino's decision to evict members of the [[Occupy Boston]] protest, on the [[Rose Kennedy Greenway]]. Menino later commented that "...civil disobedience will not be tolerated."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/Boston/metrodesk/2011/10/boston-mayor-says-sympathizes-with-protesters-but-they-can-tie-the-city/GFmOU1qwApiGhBNsNSzMIL/index.html|title= Boston mayor says protesters can't tie up the city|publisher=Boston Globe|date=2011-10-11|author=Andrew Ryan}}</ref>
