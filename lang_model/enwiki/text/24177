'''''Joymati''''' or ''Joimoti'' ({{lang-as|<U+099C><U+09AF><U+09BC><U+09AE><U+09A4><U+09C0>}}, released on 10 March 1935, was the first-ever [[Cinema of Assam|Assamese film]]. Based on [[Lakshminath Bezbaruah]]'s play on the 17th-century story of [[Sati Joymati]], the film was produced and directed by the noted [[Assam]] poet [[Jyotiprasad Agarwala]], and starred  [[Aideu Handique]] and acclaimed stage actor and playwright [[Phani Sarma]]. The film was shot between 1933 and 1935,<ref>Tamuli, Babul (2002) [http://web.archive.org/web/20091027150630/http://www.geocities.com/bipuljyoti/cinema/joymoti.html "The making of Joymoti"], ''The Assam Tribune''.</ref> and released by Chitralekha Movietone in 1935, which marked the beginning of [[Assamese cinema]]. 

''Joymati'' is the first Assamese film to be screened in the U.S. Society of Cinema and Media Studies (SCMC) of Northwestern University in Evanston, Los Angeles, has invited Joymati for its 50th international conference to be held 17&ndash;21 March 2011.<ref>[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1100101/jsp/northeast/story_11929265.jsp The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Northeast |''Joymoti ''goes Hollywood]</ref>

Although never a commercial success, the film was noted for its political views and the use of a female [[protagonist]], which in [[Indian cinema]] at the time was almost unheard of.

==Plot summary==
Set in 17th-century [[Assam]], the film recounts the sacrifice of [[Sati Joymati|Joymati]], a [[medieval]] [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]] [[princess]] who was tortured and killed by the evil [[Borphukan]] for refusing to betray her husband. The event is interpreted in contemporary [[patriotic]] terms and calls for a greater harmony between the people of the hills and the plains. The hills are represented by the leader Dalimi, a Naga tribeswoman who shelters the fugitive Prince [[Gadapani]].

==Background ==
[[Image:Joymati3.jpg|thumb|right|Screenshot from ''Joymati'' (actress [[Swargajyoti Barooah]] as Dalimi)|200px]] 
On his way back from England, Jyoti Prasad Agarwala spent about six months at the [[Universum Film AG|UFA Studio]], learning filmmaking. After reaching Assam, he decided to make his first film. He established Chitraban Studios at Bholaguri Tea Estate.  Two camps were established: one near the Manager's Bungalow for the female artists and the other near the tea factory for the male artists. Tea was manufactured in the day, and at night artists performed rehearsals. The artists were made to perform physical exercises to keep them fit.

A special property room was constructed, in which Jyoti Prasad Agarwala collected traditional costumes, ornaments, props, hats, etc. This became a virtual museum. Technicians were brought from Lahore. Ice was transported from Calcutta for developing the film.  

The film was taken to Dhaka for editing, when he discovered that there was no sound for half. Due to constraints he could not collect the artists from their native places. He hired a sound studio and dubbed the voices of all male and female characters.  On a single day he recorded six thousand feet of film.<ref>Bora, Prafulla Prasad: "Film Making in Assam", ''The Brahmaputra Beckons'', 1982.</ref>

===Plot background===
Joymati was the wife of the [[Ahom Dynasty|Ahom]] prince [[Gadapani]].  During the purge of the princes from 1679 to 1681 under King [[Sulikphaa]] (Loraa Roja) instigated by Laluk Sola, Gadapani took flight. At times he took shelter at Sattras and the adjoining hills outside the Ahom kingdom. Failing to trace Prince Gadapani, Sulikphaa's soldiers picked up his wife Joymati. Despite brutal and inhuman torture, the princess did not reveal the whereabouts of her husband. After continuous torture for several days she expired. 

Joymati's self-sacrifice bore fruit later. Laluk was murdered in November 1680 by a disgruntled body of household retainers. The ministers were now roused to a sense of patriotism, they made a search for Gadapani. [[Gadapani]] gathered strength came back from his exile in [[Garo hills]] to oust [[Sulikphaa]] from the throne. Joymati knew that her husband was the only person who could end Sulikphaa-Laluk terror rule. For her love and supreme sacrifice for her husband and the country, folk accounts refer to her as a ''Sati''.

==Reception==
The film was released on 10 March 1935 at Raonak Theatre and was inaugurated by [[Laxminath Bezbarua]].  At [[Guwahati]] it was screened at Kumar Bhaskar Natya Mandir, the only cinema house with sound in the entire Assam.  The film was not well received, and it suffered a huge financial loss. The film was able to collect only INR 24,000 from its theatrical run in respect to the budget of INR 50,000 at that time, which is equal to present day INR 75,00,000.

==Overview==
[[Image:Joymati4.jpg|right|200px|thumb|]]
''Joymati'' is a study into the visual culture and history of the [[Assam]] region of [[North-East India]]. ''Joymati'' carried the bright possibility of a film tradition. The significant similarities with the [[Russia]]n montage, reflect an element of influence. The film is noted for its constantly changing camera angles, the unique sets, and other stylistics tactics, assembled from the imagination of Jyotiprasad in his film debut. His [[poetic]] and [[artistic]] demeanor can clearly be seen in this pioneering film.

==Technical specifics==
The film was shot on a 4267.20 m length film.

==Filming ==
For indoor shooting, Jyotiprasad set up a studio at Bholaguri Tea Estate, near [[Gohpur]] which was owned by the Agarwalla family. Named Chitraban, the studio was built using local materials such as wood, [[bamboo]] and [[banana]] stumps. The set was artistically designed by Jyotiprasad himself using bamboo mats, [[japis]] of different sizes, [[deer]] horns, [[Domestic buffalo|buffalo]] [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]s, and [[N<U+0101>ga]] spears. To decorate the Ahom royal court, he used royal utensils such as [[maihang]], [[hengdang]], [[bhogjara]], bata, [[sariya]] and [[banbata]]. He imported a Faizi sound recording system from [[Lahore]] and the first camera into [[Assam]] from Mehta of [[Kolkata]]. 

The unit arrived at Bholaguri Tea Estate to commence filming in December 1933 and camped in front of the garden factory. Jyotiprasad made all the accommodation arrangements and set up a laboratory for developing film by the side of his <U+2018>Chitraban<U+2019> studio. 

According to [[Natasurya Phani Sarma]], who acted an important role in the film, Chitraban was not only a studio, but was more like a film training institute. Apart from acting, Jyotiprasad taught the actors the techniques of filmmaking such as developing, processing, [[printing]] and [[editing]], whilst revealing his sound knowledge of different film shots like mixed shot, [[fade (filmmaking)|fade out]], [[zoom lens|zoom]], dissolve, back projection and model shooting. The 17th century costumes used in the film were designed by Jyotiprasad and the make-up was done by the actors themselves, assisted by Sonitkowar Gajen Borua. 
[[Image:Joymati5.jpg|thumb|left|The first ever Assamese film studio at the Bholaguri Tea Estate]]
The shooting at the Chitraban studio started in April 1934 but was initially delayed as director Jyotiprasad could not find a suitable young woman to play heroine or several other members which would be suited to the role. Jyotiprasad floated newspaper advertisements for actors and actresses, mentioning brief outlines of the film and descriptions of the characters. His idea was to get <U+2018>types<U+2019> for his characters, not seasoned artists, even offering remunerations for successful candidates. One of his preconditions was that potential actors needed to be from <U+2018>respectable<U+2019> family backgrounds, as opposed to those from red-light areas that had been used during the 1930s in [[Calcutta]]. After a prolonged search and detailed interviews, he discovered [[Aideu Handique]] to play the role of Joymoti in a remote village near [[Golaghat]]: She became the first actress of [[Assamese cinema]]. He then brought together the other chosen actors to acquaint them with his characters, few of who had ever even seen a film. He sought out a filmmaking trio, [[Bhupal Shankar Mehta]] and the Faizi Brothers, from Lahore as cameraman and sound-recordists. 

During filming, due to the rainy season, developments in the processes were inhibited, and he had to suspend shooting for several days due to insufficient light with no [[electricity]]. Shooting was done under sunlight by using reflectors. When the rain stopped, the banana stumps used to build the Ahom court dried under the sunlight, yet filming continued only by fastening [[japis]] in those places. Filming was eventually completed in August 1934 and released in early 1935 after Jyotiprasad used his editing skills.

==Film rediscovered==
After the [[Second World War]] the film was almost forgotten and lost; in the early 1970s, Jyotiprasad<U+2019>s youngest brother, Hridayananda Agarwalla, found seven reels of the lone print of ''Joymoti'' while cleaning junk out of his garage. Jyotiprasad<U+2019>s venture had cost his family<U+2019>s tea garden huge losses and had placed his family in difficulties. The condition of the reels was one of near-depletion, but his brother Hridayananda Agarwalla hired [[Bhupen Hazarika]], another famous Assamese director to conduct the long documentary, ''[[Rupkonwar Jyotiprasad aru Joymoti]]'' in 1976, in which the reels were incorporated. The documentary saved the reels which have been copied and remastered.

==The fate of the filming studio==
Situated about 10&nbsp;km west of [[Gohpur]], the temporary film studio at Bholaguri today looks deserted, bearing the nostalgia of its glorious past. Once owned by Jyotiprasad, the ownership of the garden passed on to the [[Assam Tea Corporation]] in 1978. The garden, where Jyotiprasad laid the foundation stone of Assamese cinema, lies abandoned. The bungalow, where Jyotiprasad composed the music of ''Joymati'' on his organ, still stands but in a dilapidated condition.
