He pioneered ''[[satyagraha]]''.  This is defined as resistance to [[tyranny]] through mass [[civil disobedience]], a philosophy firmly founded upon ''[[ahimsa]]'', or total [[nonviolence]]. This concept helped India to gain independence, and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. Gandhi is sometimes referred to as ''Mahatma Gandhi'' ({{IPA-hns|m<U+0259><U+0266>a<U+02D0>t<U+032A>ma<U+02D0>|}}; [[Sanskrit]]: <U+092E><U+0939><U+093E><U+0924><U+094D><U+092E><U+093E> ''[[Mahatma|mah<U+0101>tm<U+0101>]]'' or "Great Soul", an [[honorific]] first applied to him by [[Rabindranath Tagore]]),.<ref>{{Cite document|title=The Mahatma and the Poet|last=Bhattacharya|first=Sabyasachi|publisher=National Book Trust, India|place=New Delhi|year=1997|page=1|ref=harv|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>  In India he is also called '''Bapu''' ({{lang-gu|<U+0AAC><U+0ABE><U+0AAA><U+0AC1>}}, ''b<U+0101>pu'' or "Father").  He is officially honoured in India as the ''[[Father of the Nation]]''; his birthday, 2 October, is commemorated there as ''[[Gandhi Jayanti]]'', a [[holidays in India|national holiday]], and worldwide as the [[International Day of Non-Violence]].

Gandhi first employed [[civil disobedience]] while an expatriate lawyer in South Africa, during the resident Indian community's struggle there for civil rights. During this time, he wrote articles for Indian newspapers about [[black people]] that some modern readers consider [[racist]]. After his return to India in 1915, he organised protests by peasants, farmers, and urban labourers concerning excessive land-tax and discrimination.  After assuming leadership of the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns to ease poverty, expand women's rights, build religious and ethnic amity, end [[dalit|untouchability]], and increase economic self-reliance. Above all, he aimed to achieve ''[[Swaraj]]'' or the independence of India from foreign domination. Gandhi famously led his followers in the [[Non-cooperation movement]] that protested the British-imposed salt tax with the 400&nbsp;km (240&nbsp;mi) [[Salt Satyagraha|Dandi Salt March]] in 1930. Later, in 1942, he launched the ''[[Quit India Movement|Quit India]]'' [[civil disobedience]] movement demanding immediate independence for India. Gandhi spent a number of years in jail in both South Africa and India.

As a practitioner of ''[[ahimsa]]'', Gandhi swore to speak the [[truth]] and advocated that others do the same.  He lived modestly in a [[Sabarmati Ashram|self-sufficient residential community]] and wore the traditional Indian ''[[dhoti]]'' and shawl, woven from yarn that he had spun by hand himself.  He ate simple vegetarian food, experimented for a time with a [[fruitarian]] diet, and undertook long [[Fasting|fasts]] as a means of both self-purification and social protest.

==Early life and background==
[[File:Young Gandhi.jpg|upright|thumb|A young Gandhi, [[circa|c.]] 1876]]
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi<ref>Gandhi means "grocer" in Gujarati (''L. R. Gala, Popular Combined Dictionary, English-English-Gujarati & Gujarati-Gujarati-English, Navneet''), or "perfumer" in Hindi (''Bhargava's Standard Illustrated Dictionary Hindi-English'').</ref> was born on 2 October 1869 in [[Porbandar]], a coastal town which was then part of the [[Bombay Presidency]], [[British Raj|British India]].  His father, Karamchand Gandhi (1822<U+2013>1885), who belonged to the [[Hindu]] [[Modh]] community, served as the ''[[Diwan (title)|diwan]]'' (Prime Minister) of [[Porbandar|Porbander state]], a small [[princely state]] in the [[Kathiawar Agency]] of [[British Raj|British India]].<ref name=fischer1954>{{Cite document|title=Gandhi:His life and message for the world|last= Fischer|first= Louis|year= 1954|publisher=Mentor|ref= harv|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> His grandfather was Uttamchand Gandhi, fondly called Utta Gandhi. His mother, Putlibai, who came from the Hindu Pranami [[Vaishnava]] community, was Karamchand's fourth wife, the first three wives having apparently died in childbirth.<ref name=tendulkar/>  Growing up with a devout mother and the [[Jainism|Jain]] traditions of the region, the young Mohandas absorbed early the influences that would play an important role in his adult life; these included compassion for sentient beings, vegetarianism, [[fasting]] for self-purification, and mutual tolerance between individuals of different creeds.<ref>{{Cite web

The Indian classics, especially the stories of [[Shravan#In Hindu epics|Shravana]] and [[Harishchandra|Maharaja Harishchandra]] from the Indian epics, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood. The story of Harishchandra, a well known tale of an ancient Indian king and a truthful hero, haunted Gandhi as a boy. Gandhi in his autobiography admits that it left an indelible impression on his mind. He writes: "It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number." Gandhi's early self-identification with Truth and Love as supreme values is traceable to his identification with these epic characters.<ref>Pitirim Aleksandrovich Sorokin, [http://books.google.com/books?id=DGCleCxTkbIC&pg=PA169 The ways and power of love], Templeton Foundation Press 2002, p.169 ISBN 1890151866</ref><ref>Lloyd I. Rudolph  [http://books.google.com/books?id=JsPYNLAU9KYC&pg=PA48 Gandhi, the traditional roots of charisma], University of Chicago Press 1983 ISBN 0226731367</ref>

In May 1883, the 13-year old Mohandas was married to 14-year old [[Kasturba Gandhi|Kasturbai Makhanji]] (her first name was usually shortened to "Kasturba", and affectionately to "Ba") in an [[arranged marriage|arranged child marriage]], according to the custom of the region.<ref name=autobio-wedding>{{Harvnb|Gandhi|1940|pp=5<U+2013>7}}</ref> Recalling the day of their marriage he once said that " As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives." However, as was also the custom of the region, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gandhi|1940|p=9}}</ref>  In 1885, when Gandhi was 15, the couple's first child was born, but survived only a few days; Gandhi's father, Karamchand Gandhi, had died earlier that year.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gandhi|1940|pp=20<U+2013>22}}</ref> Mohandas and Kasturba had four more children, all sons: [[Harilal Gandhi|Harilal]], born in 1888; [[Manilal Gandhi|Manilal]], born in 1892; [[Ramdas Gandhi|Ramdas]], born in 1897; and [[Devdas Gandhi|Devdas]], born in 1900.  At his middle school in Porbandar and high school in Rajkot, Gandhi remained an average student academically.  He passed the [[Matriculation|matriculation exam]] for Samaldas College at [[Bhavnagar]], [[Gujarat]] with some difficulty. While there, he was unhappy, in part because his family wanted him to become a [[barrister]].
[[File:Gandhi and Kasturbhai 1902.jpg|left|thumb|Gandhi and his wife [[Kasturba Gandhi|Kasturba]] (1902)]]
On 4 September 1888, less than a month shy of his 19th birthday, Gandhi travelled to London, England, to study law at [[University College London]] and to train as a [[barrister]].  His time in London, the Imperial capital, was influenced by a vow he had made to his mother in the presence of the Jain monk Becharji, upon leaving India, to observe the Hindu precepts of abstinence from meat, alcohol, and promiscuity.<ref name=brown>{{Cite document|last=Brown|first=Judith M|title=Gandhi: Prisoner of Hope|publisher=Yale University Press|place=New Haven|year=1989|page=22|ref=harv|isbn=0300051255}}</ref> Although Gandhi experimented with adopting "English" customs<U+2014>taking dancing lessons for example<U+2014>he could not stomach the bland vegetarian food offered by his landlady and he was always hungry until he found one of London's few vegetarian restaurants. Influenced by [[Henry Stephens Salt|Salt's]] book, he joined the [[Vegetarian Society]], was elected to its executive committee,<ref name=brown/> and started a local Bayswater chapter.<ref name=tendulkar>{{Cite document|first=D. G.|last=Tendulkar|title=Mahatma volume 1|publisher=Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India|year=1951|place=Delhi|ref=harv|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Some of the vegetarians he met were members of the [[Theosophical Society]], which had been founded in 1875 to further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] literature. They encouraged Gandhi to join them in reading the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' both in translation as well as in the original.<ref name=brown/>  Not having shown a particular interest in religion before, he became interested in religious thought and began to read both [[Hinduism|Hindu]] as well as Christian scriptures.<ref name=tendulkar/><ref name=brown/>

Gandhi was called to the bar on 10 June 1891 and left London for India on 12 June 1891,<ref name=tendulkar/> where he learned that his mother had died while he was in London, his family having kept the news from him.<ref name=brown/> His attempts at establishing a law practice in [[Bombay]] failed and, later, after applying and being turned down for a part-time job as a high school teacher, he ended up returning to [[Rajkot]] to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants, a business he was forced to close when he ran afoul of a British officer. In his autobiography he refers to this incident as an unsuccessful attempt to lobby on behalf of his older brother.<ref name=tendulkar/><ref name=brown/> It was in this climate that, in April 1893, he accepted a year-long contract from Dada Abdulla & Co., an Indian firm, to a post in the [[Colony of Natal]], South Africa, then part of the [[British Empire]].<ref name=tendulkar/>

==Civil rights movement in South Africa (1893<U+2013>1914)==

{{Main|Gandhi's work in South Africa}}
[[File:Gandhi Boer War 1899.jpg|right|thumb|M.K. Gandhi while serving in the Ambulance Corps during the Boer War]]

In South Africa, Gandhi faced the discrimination directed at Indians. He was thrown off a train at [[Pietermaritzburg]] after refusing to move from the first class to a third-class coach while holding a valid first-class ticket.<ref name=essential>{{Cite document|title=Essential Gandhi|last=Fischer|first=Louis|publisher=Random House|place=New York|year=1962|ref=harv|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Travelling farther on by stagecoach he was beaten by a driver for refusing to travel on the foot board to make room for a European passenger.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gandhi|1940|p=99}}</ref> He suffered other hardships on the journey as well, including being barred from several hotels. In another incident, the magistrate of a [[Durban]] court ordered Gandhi to remove his [[turban]] <U+2013> which he refused to do.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gandhi|1940|p=93}}</ref> These events were a turning point in his life, awakening him to social injustice and influencing his subsequent social activism. It was through witnessing firsthand the [[racism]], [[prejudice]] and injustice against Indians in South Africa that Gandhi started to question his people's status within the [[British Empire]], and his own place in society.

Gandhi extended his original period of stay in South Africa to assist Indians in opposing a bill to deny them the right to vote. Though unable to halt the bill's passage, his campaign was successful in drawing attention to the grievances of Indians in South Africa. He helped found the [[Natal Indian Congress]] in 1894,<ref name=tendulkar/><ref name=essential/> and through this organisation, he moulded the Indian community of South Africa into a homogeneous political force. In January 1897, when Gandhi landed in Durban he was attacked by a mob of white settlers and escaped only through the efforts of the wife of the police superintendent. He, however, refused to press charges against any member of the mob, stating it was one of his principles not to seek redress for a personal wrong in a court of law.<ref name=tendulkar/>

In 1906, the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] government promulgated a new Act compelling registration of the colony's Indian population. At a mass protest meeting held in Johannesburg on 11 September that year, Gandhi adopted his still evolving methodology of ''[[satyagraha]]'' (devotion to the truth), or non-violent protest, for the first time, calling on his fellow Indians to defy the new law and suffer the punishments for doing so, rather than resist through violent means. The community adopted this plan, leading to a seven-year struggle in which thousands of Indians were jailed (including Gandhi), flogged, or even shot, for striking, refusing to register, burning their registration cards or engaging in other forms of non-violent resistance. While the government was successful in repressing the Indian protesters, the public outcry stemming from the harsh methods employed by the South African government in the face of peaceful Indian protesters finally forced South African General [[Jan Christiaan Smuts]] to negotiate a compromise with Gandhi. Gandhi's ideas took shape and the concept of ''satyagraha'' matured during this struggle.

===Racism and controversy===
Some of Gandhi's early South African articles are controversial. On 7 March 1908, Gandhi wrote in the ''[[Indian Opinion]]'' of his time in a South African prison: "[[Kaffir (racial term)|Kaffirs]] are as a rule uncivilised<U+2014>the convicts even more so. They are troublesome, very dirty and live almost like animals."<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi|volume=8|page=199}}</ref> Writing on the subject of immigration in 1903, Gandhi commented: "We believe as much in the purity of race as we think they do... We believe also that the white race in South Africa should be the predominating race."<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi|volume=3|page=255}}</ref> During his time in South Africa, Gandhi protested repeatedly about the social classification of blacks with Indians, whom he described as "undoubtedly infinitely superior to the Kaffirs".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi|volume=2|page=270}}</ref>  Remarks such as these have led some to accuse Gandhi of racism.<ref name="guardian_racist">Rory Carroll, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/oct/17/southafrica.india "Gandhi branded racist as Johannesburg honours freedom fighter"], ''The Guardian'', 17 October 2003.</ref> It is worth noting though that the word Kaffir had a different connotation in Gandhi's time than its current day meaning.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia

Two professors of history who specialise in South Africa, Surendra Bhana and Goolam Vahed, examined this controversy in their text, ''The Making of a Political Reformer: Gandhi in South Africa, 1893<U+2013>1914.'' (New Delhi: Manohar, 2005). They focus in Chapter 1, "Gandhi, Africans and Indians in Colonial Natal" on the relationship between the African and Indian communities under "White rule" and policies which enforced segregation (and, they argue, led to inevitable conflict between these communities). Of this relationship they state that, "the young Gandhi was influenced by segregationist notions prevalent in the 1890s."<ref>''The Making of a Political Reformer: Gandhi in South Africa, 1893<U+2013>1914.'' Surendra Bhana and Goolam Vahed, 2005: p.44</ref> At the same time, they state, "Gandhi's experiences in jail seemed to make him more sensitive to their plight...the later Gandhi mellowed; he seemed much less categorical in his expression of prejudice against Africans, and much more open to seeing points of common cause. His negative views in the Johannesburg jail were reserved for hardened African prisoners rather than Africans generally."<ref>''The Making of a Political Reformer: Gandhi in South Africa, 1893<U+2013>1914.'' Surendra Bhana and Goolam Vahed, 2005: p.45</ref> However, when plans to unveil a statue of Gandhi in [[Johannesburg]] was announced, a movement unsuccessfully tried to block it because of Gandhi's "racist" statements.<ref name="guardian_racist"/>

===Role in Zulu War of 1906===
{{Main|Bambatha Rebellion}}
In 1906, after the British introduced a new poll-tax, [[Zulu people|Zulus]] in South Africa killed two British officers.  In response, the British declared [[Zulu War of 1906|war against the Zulus]].  Gandhi actively encouraged the British to recruit Indians.  He argued that Indians should support the war efforts in order to legitimise their claims to full citizenship. The British, however, refused to commission Indians as army officers.  Nonetheless, they accepted Gandhi's offer to let a detachment of Indians volunteer as a stretcher-bearer corps to treat wounded British soldiers.  This corps was commanded by Gandhi. On 21 July 1906, Gandhi wrote in ''[[Indian Opinion]]'': "The corps had been formed at the instance of the Natal Government by way of experiment, in connection with the operations against the Natives consists of twenty three Indians".<ref>Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi Vol 5 Document#393 from Gandhi: Behind the Mask of Divinity p106</ref> Gandhi urged the Indian population in South Africa to join the war through his columns in ''Indian Opinion'': <U+201C>If the Government only realised what reserve force is being wasted, they would make use of it and give Indians the opportunity of a thorough training for actual warfare.<U+201D><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gandhism.net/sergeantmajorgandhi.php |title= Sergeant Major Gandhi |accessdate= 3 March 2009 |publisher=Gandhism.net}}</ref>

In Gandhi's opinion, the Draft Ordinance of 1906 brought the status of Indians below the level of Natives.  He therefore urged Indians to resist the Ordinance along the lines of ''[[satyagraha]]'' by taking the example of "[[Kaffir (ethnic slur)|Kaffirs]]".  In his words, "Even the half-castes and kaffirs, who are less advanced than we, have resisted the government. The pass law applies to them as well, but they do not take out passes."<ref>Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi, Vol. 5, p. 410</ref>

In 1927 Gandhi wrote of the event: "The [[Boer War]] had not brought home to me the horrors of war with anything like the vividness that the [Zulu] 'rebellion' did.  This was no war but a man-hunt, not only in my opinion, but also in that of many Englishmen with whom I had occasion to talk."<ref>{{Cite book|author=Desai, Mahadev H. |title=Autobiography: the story of my experiments with truth |publisher=Dover |location=Mineola, N.Y |year=1983 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=OXoRs7Kxs_YC&pg=PR1|isbn=0-486-24593-4 |page=313}}</ref>

==Struggle for Indian Independence (1915<U+2013>1945)==
{{See also|Indian Independence Movement}}
In 1915, Gandhi returned from South Africa to live in India.  He spoke at the conventions of the [[Indian National Congress]], but was primarily introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people by [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], a respected leader of the Congress Party at the time.

===Role in World War I===
In April 1918, during the latter part of World War I, the [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford|Viceroy]] invited Gandhi to a War Conference in Delhi<ref>
[[s:Chronology of Mahatma Gandhi's life/India 1918|Chronology of Mahatma Gandhi]]</ref> Perhaps to show his support for the Empire and help his case for India's independence,<ref>[http://wikilivres.info/wiki/The_Story_of_My_Experiments_with_Truth/Part_V/Recruiting_Campaign The Story of My Experiments with Truth/Part V/Recruiting Campaign], Gandhi's Autobiography</ref> Gandhi agreed to actively recruit Indians for the war effort.<ref name="wikilivres.info">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wikilivres.info/wiki/Day_to_Day_with_Gandhi/Volume_1/Preface |title=Day to Day with Gandhi by Mahadev Desai |publisher=Wikilivres.info |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}</ref> In contrast to the Zulu War of 1906 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when he recruited volunteers for the Ambulance Corps, this time Gandhi attempted to recruit combatants. In a June 1918 leaflet entitled "Appeal for Enlistment", Gandhi wrote "To bring about such a state of things we should have the ability to defend ourselves, that is, the ability to bear arms and to use them...If we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest possible despatch, it is our duty to enlist ourselves in the army."<ref>[http://www.gandhiserve.org/cwmg/VOL017.PDF 67.

===Champaran and Kheda===
{{Main|Champaran and Kheda Satyagraha}}
[[File:Gandhi Kheda 1918.jpg|right|thumb|Gandhi in 1918, at the time of the Kheda and Champaran satyagrahas]]
Gandhi's first major achievements came in 1918 with the [[Champaran]] agitation and ''Kheda Satyagraha'', although in the latter it was [[Indigo plant|indigo]] and other cash crops instead of the food crops necessary for their survival. Suppressed by the militias of the landlords (mostly British), they were given measly compensation, leaving them mired in extreme poverty. The villages were kept extremely dirty and unhygienic; and alcoholism, [[dalit|untouchability]] and [[purdah]] were rampant. Now in the throes of a devastating famine, the British levied a tax which they insisted on increasing. The situation was desperate. In [[Kheda]] in [[Gujarat]], the problem was the same. Gandhi established an [[ashram]] there, organising scores of his veteran supporters and fresh volunteers from the region. He organised a detailed study and survey of the villages, accounting for the atrocities and terrible episodes of suffering, including the general state of degenerate living. Building on the confidence of villagers, he began leading the clean-up of villages, building of schools and hospitals and encouraging the village leadership to undo and condemn many social evils, as accounted above.

But his main impact came when he was arrested by police on the charge of creating unrest and was ordered to leave the province. Hundreds of thousands of people protested and rallied outside the jail, police stations and courts demanding his release, which the court reluctantly granted. Gandhi led organised protests and strikes against the landlords who, with the guidance of the British government, signed an agreement granting the poor farmers of the region more compensation and control over farming, and cancellation of revenue hikes and its collection until the famine ended. It was during this agitation, that Gandhi was addressed by the people as ''Bapu'' (Father) and ''Mahatma'' (Great Soul). In Kheda, [[Sardar Patel]] represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners. As a result, Gandhi's fame spread all over the nation and because of this, he is now called "Father of the nation" in India.

===Non-cooperation===
{{Main|Non-cooperation movement}}
Gandhi employed non-cooperation, non-violence and peaceful resistance as his "weapons" in the struggle against the [[British Raj]]. In [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]] of civilians by British troops (also known as the [[Amritsar Massacre]]) caused deep trauma to the nation, leading to increased public anger and acts of violence. Gandhi criticised both the actions of the [[British Raj]] and the retaliatory violence of Indians. He authored the resolution offering condolences to British civilian victims and condemning the riots which, after initial opposition in the party, was accepted following Gandhi's emotional speech advocating his principle that all violence was evil and could not be justified.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', p. 82.</ref> But it was after the massacre and subsequent violence that Gandhi's mind focused upon obtaining complete self-government and control of all Indian government institutions, maturing soon into ''[[Swaraj]]'' or complete individual, spiritual, political independence.

[[File:Mahatma Gandhi's room at Sabarmati Ashram.jpg|right|thumb|Mahatma Gandhi's room at [[Sabarmati Ashram]]]]
[[File:Gandhi home.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sabarmati Ashram]], Gandhi's home in Gujarat]]

In December 1921, Gandhi was invested with executive authority on behalf of the [[Indian National Congress]]. Under his leadership, the Congress was reorganised with a new constitution, with the goal of ''Swaraj''. Membership in the party was opened to anyone prepared to pay a token fee. A hierarchy of committees was set up to improve discipline, transforming the party from an elite organisation to one of mass national appeal. Gandhi expanded his non-violence platform to include the [[Swadeshi movement|''swadeshi'' policy]]&nbsp;<U+2014> the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to this was his advocacy that ''[[khadi]]'' (homespun cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women, rich or poor, to spend time each day spinning ''khadi'' in support of the independence movement.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', p. 89.</ref> This was a strategy to inculcate discipline and dedication to weed out the unwilling and ambitious, and to include women in the movement at a time when many thought that such activities were not respectable activities for women. In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people to boycott British educational institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake [[British honours system|British titles and honours]].

"Non-cooperation" enjoyed widespread appeal and success, increasing excitement and participation from all strata of Indian society. Yet, just as the movement reached its apex, it ended abruptly as a result of a violent clash in the town of [[Chauri Chaura]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], in February 1922. Fearing that the movement was about to take a turn towards violence, and convinced that this would be the undoing of all his work, Gandhi called off the campaign of mass civil disobedience.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', p. 105.</ref> Gandhi was arrested on 10 March 1922, tried for sedition, and sentenced to six years' imprisonment. He began his sentence on 18 March 1922.  He was released in February 1924 for an [[appendicitis]] operation, having served only 2 years.

Without Gandhi's uniting personality, the Indian National Congress began to splinter during his years in prison, splitting into two factions, one led by [[Chitta Ranjan Das]] and [[Motilal Nehru]] favouring party participation in the legislatures, and the other led by [[Chakravarti Rajagopalachari]] and [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], opposing this move. Furthermore, cooperation among Hindus and Muslims, which had been strong at the height of the non-violence campaign, was breaking down. Gandhi attempted to bridge these differences through many means, including a three-week fast in the autumn of 1924, but with limited success.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', p. 131.</ref>

===Salt Satyagraha (Salt March)===
{{Main|Salt Satyagraha}}
[[File:Gandhi at Dandi 5 April 1930.jpg|thumb|Gandhi at Dandi, 5 April 1930, at the end of the [[Salt Satyagraha|Salt March]]]]
Gandhi stayed out of active politics and, as such, the limelight for most of the 1920s. He focused instead on resolving the wedge between the Swaraj Party and the Indian National Congress, and expanding initiatives against untouchability, alcoholism, ignorance and poverty. He returned to the fore in 1928. In the preceding year, the British government had appointed a new constitutional reform commission under Sir John Simon, which did not include any Indian as its member. The result was a boycott of the commission by Indian political parties. Gandhi pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928 calling on the British government to grant India dominion status or face a new campaign of non-cooperation with complete independence for the country as its goal. Gandhi had not only moderated the views of younger men like [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] and [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], who sought a demand for immediate independence, but also reduced his own call to a one year wait, instead of two.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', p. 172.</ref> The British did not respond. On 31 December 1929, the flag of India was unfurled in Lahore. 26 January 1930 was celebrated as India's Independence Day by the Indian National Congress meeting in Lahore. This day was commemorated by almost every other Indian organisation. Gandhi then launched a new satyagraha against the tax on salt in March 1930. This was highlighted by the famous Salt March to Dandi from 12 March to 6 April, where he marched 388 kilometres (241 miles) from Ahmedabad to Dandi, Gujarat to make salt himself. Thousands of Indians joined him on this march to the sea. This campaign was one of his most successful at upsetting British hold on India; Britain responded by imprisoning over 60,000&nbsp;people.

The government, represented by [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Edward Irwin]], decided to negotiate with Gandhi. The [[Gandhi<U+2013>Irwin Pact]] was signed in March 1931. The British Government agreed to free all political prisoners, in return for the suspension of the civil disobedience movement. Also as a result of the pact, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists, because it focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power. Furthermore, Lord Irwin's successor, [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|Lord Willingdon]], began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement. Gandhi was again arrested, and the government tried to negate his influence by completely isolating him from his followers. But this tactic failed.
[[File:Mahadev Desai and Gandhi 2 1939.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mahadev Desai]] (left) reading out a letter to Gandhi from the [[viceroy]] at Birla House, Bombay, 7 April 1939]]

In 1932, through the campaigning of the Dalit leader [[B. R. Ambedkar]], the government granted untouchables separate electorates under the new constitution. In protest, Gandhi embarked on a six-day fast in September 1932. The resulting public outcry successfully forced the government to adopt a more equitable arrangement via negotiations mediated by the Dalit cricketer turned political leader [[Palwankar Baloo]]. This was the start of a new campaign by Gandhi to improve the lives of the untouchables, whom he named Harijans, the children of God. On 8 May 1933, Gandhi began a 21-day fast of self-purification to help the Harijan movement.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', pp. 230<U+2013>32.</ref> This new campaign was not universally embraced within the [[Dalit (outcaste)|Dalit]] community, as prominent leader [[B. R. Ambedkar]] condemned Gandhi's use of the term ''Harijans'' as saying that Dalits were socially immature, and that privileged caste Indians played a paternalistic role. Ambedkar and his allies also felt Gandhi was undermining Dalit political rights. Gandhi, although born into the [[Vaishya]] caste, insisted that he was able to speak on behalf of Dalits, despite the presence of Dalit activists such as Ambedkar.

In the summer of 1934, three unsuccessful attempts were made on Gandhi's life.

When the Congress Party chose to contest elections and accept power under the Federation scheme, Gandhi resigned from party membership. He did not disagree with the party's move, but felt that if he resigned, his popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, that actually varied from communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, to those with pro-business convictions and that these various voices would get a chance to make themselves heard. Gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', p. 246.</ref>

Gandhi returned to active politics again in 1936, with the Nehru presidency and the Lucknow session of the Congress. Although Gandhi wanted a total focus on the task of winning independence and not speculation about India's future, he did not restrain the Congress from adopting socialism as its goal. Gandhi had a clash with [[Subhas Bose]], who had been elected president in 1938. Their main points of contention were Bose's lack of commitment to democracy, and lack of faith in non-violence. Bose won his second term despite Gandhi's criticism, but left the Congress when the All-India leaders resigned en masse in protest of his abandonment of the principles introduced by Gandhi.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', pp. 277<U+2013>81.</ref>

===World War II and ''Quit India''===
{{Main|Quit India Movement}}
[[File:Nehruwithgandhi1942.jpg|thumb|[[Jawaharlal Nehru]] sitting next to Gandhi at the AICC General Session, 1942]]
World War II broke out in 1939 when [[Nazi Germany]] invaded Poland. Initially, Gandhi favoured offering "non-violent moral support" to the British effort, but other Congressional leaders were offended by the unilateral inclusion of India in the war, without consultation of the people's representatives. All Congressmen resigned from office.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', pp. 283<U+2013>86.</ref> After long deliberations, Gandhi declared that India could not be party to a war ostensibly being fought for democratic freedom, while that freedom was denied to India itself. As the war progressed, Gandhi intensified his demand for independence, drafting a resolution calling for the British to ''[[Quit India]]''. This was Gandhi's and the Congress Party's most definitive revolt aimed at securing the British exit from India.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', p. 309.</ref>

[[File:Right against might.jpg|left|thumb|"I want world sympathy in this battle of [[might makes right|right against might]]" - [[Dandi, Gujarat|Dandi]] 5th Apr 1930]]
Gandhi was criticised by some Congress party members and other Indian political groups, both pro-British and anti-British. Some felt that not supporting Britain more in its struggle against Nazi Germany was unethical. Others felt that Gandhi's refusal for India to participate in the war was insufficient and more direct opposition should be taken, while Britain fought against Nazism yet continued to contradict itself by refusing to grant India Independence. ''Quit India'' became the most forceful movement in the history of the struggle, with mass arrests and violence on an unprecedented scale.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', p. 318.</ref>  Thousands of freedom fighters were killed or injured by police gunfire, and hundreds of thousands were arrested. Gandhi and his supporters made it clear they would not support the war effort unless India were granted immediate independence. He even clarified that this time the movement would not be stopped if individual acts of violence were committed, saying that the ''"ordered anarchy"'' around him was ''"worse than real anarchy."'' He called on all Congressmen and Indians to maintain discipline via [[ahimsa]], and ''Karo Ya Maro'' ("Do or Die") in the cause of ultimate freedom.

Gandhi and the entire Congress Working Committee were arrested in [[Bombay]] by the British on 9 August 1942. Gandhi was held for two years in the [[Aga Khan Palace]] in [[Pune]]. It was here that Gandhi suffered two terrible blows in his personal life. His 50-year old secretary [[Mahadev Desai]] died of a heart attack 6&nbsp;days later and his wife Kasturba died after 18 months imprisonment in 22 February 1944; six weeks later Gandhi suffered a severe [[malaria]] attack. He was released before the end of the war on 6 May 1944 because of his failing health and necessary surgery; the Raj did not want him to die in prison and enrage the nation. Although the Quit India movement had moderate success in its objective, the ruthless suppression of the movement brought order to India by the end of 1943. At the end of the war, the British gave clear indications that power would be transferred to Indian hands. At this point Gandhi called off the struggle, and around 100,000 political prisoners were released, including the Congress's leadership.

[[Stanley Wolpert]]'s words sum up Gandhi's role and views on the partition perfectly:

On 30 January 1948, Gandhi was shot while he was walking to a platform from which he was to address a prayer meeting.

==Principles, practices and beliefs==
{{See also|Gandhism}}

===Truth===
[[File:God is Truth.jpg|thumb|"God is truth. The way to truth lies through [[ahimsa]] (non-violence)" - [[Sabarmati]] 13 March 1927]]
Gandhi dedicated his life to the wider purpose of discovering [[truth]], or ''[[Satya]]''. He tried to achieve this by learning from his own mistakes and conducting experiments on himself. He called his autobiography ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth]]''.

Gandhi stated that the most important battle to fight was overcoming his own demons, fears, and insecurities. Gandhi summarised his beliefs first when he said "God is Truth". He would later change this statement to "Truth is God". Thus, ''Satya'' (Truth) in Gandhi's philosophy is "God".

===Nonviolence===
Although Mahatama Gandhi was not the originator of the principle of non-violence, he was the first to apply it in the political field on a huge scale.<ref>{{Cite book|last =Asirvatham|first =Eddy|title =Political Theory|publisher=S.chand| year =|isbn=8121903467}}</ref> The concept of [[nonviolence]] (''[[ahimsa]]'') and [[nonresistance]] has a long history in Indian religious thought and has had many revivals in Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Jewish and Christian contexts. Gandhi explains his philosophy and way of life in his autobiography ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth]]''. He was quoted as saying:

<blockquote>"When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won. There have been tyrants and murderers and for a time they seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall&nbsp;<U+2014> think of it, always."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans, and the homeless, whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or the holy name of liberty and democracy?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There are many causes that I am prepared to die for but no causes that I am prepared to kill for."</blockquote>
[[File:Gandhi leper.jpg|thumb|Gandhi nurses Parchure Shastri, a [[sanskrit]] scholar afflicted by [[leprosy]], at [[Sabarmati Ashram]], 1940 ]]
In applying these principles, Gandhi did not balk from taking them to their most logical extremes in envisioning a world where even government, police and armies were nonviolent. The quotations below are from the book "For Pacifists."<ref>Bharatan Kumarappa, Editor, "For Pacifists," by M.K. Gandhi, Navajivan Publishing House, Ahmedabad, India, 1949.</ref>

<blockquote>The science of war leads one to dictatorship, pure and simple. The science of non-violence alone can lead one to pure democracy...Power based on love is thousand times more effective and permanent than power derived from fear of punishment....It is a blasphemy to say non-violence can be practiced only by individuals and never by nations which are composed of individuals...The nearest approach to purest anarchy would be a democracy based on non-violence...A society organised and run on the basis of complete non-violence would be the purest anarchy</blockquote>

<blockquote>I have conceded that even in a non-violent state a police force may be necessary...Police ranks will be composed of believers in non-violence. The people will instinctively render them every help and through mutual cooperation they will easily deal with the ever decreasing disturbances...Violent quarrels between labor and capital and strikes will be few and far between in a non-violent state because the influence of the non-violent majority will be great as to respect the principle elements in society. Similarly, there will be no room for communal disturbances....</blockquote>

<blockquote>A non-violent army acts unlike armed men, as well in times of peace as in times of disturbances. Theirs will be the duty of bringing warring communities together, carrying peace propaganda, engaging in activities that would bring and keep them in touch with every single person in their parish or division. Such an army should be ready to cope with any emergency, and in order to still the frenzy of mobs should risk their lives in numbers sufficient for that purpose. ...Satyagraha (truth-force) brigades can be organised in every village and every block of buildings in the cities. [If the non-violent society is attacked from without] there are two ways open to non-violence. To yield possession, but non-cooperate with the aggressor...prefer death to submission. The second way would be non-violent resistance by the people who have been trained in the non-violent way...The unexpected spectacle of endless rows upon rows of men and women simply dying rather than surrender to the will of an aggressor must ultimately melt him and his soldiery...A nation or group which has made non-violence its final policy cannot be subjected to slavery even by the atom bomb.... The level of non-violence in that nation, if that even happily comes to pass, will naturally have risen so high as to command universal respect. </blockquote>

In accordance with these views, in 1940, when invasion of the British Isles by Nazi Germany looked imminent, Gandhi offered the following advice to the British people (''Non-Violence in Peace and War''):<ref>{{Cite book|last =Gandhi|first =Mahatma|title =Non-violence in peace and war, 1942<U+2013>[1949]|publisher=Garland Publishing|year =1972|isbn=0-8240-0375-6}}</ref>

<blockquote>"I would like you to lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or humanity. You will invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini to take what they want of the countries you call your possessions...If these gentlemen choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give you free passage out, you will allow yourselves, man, woman, and child, to be slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them."</blockquote>

In a post-war interview in 1946, he offered a view at an even further extreme:

<blockquote>"Hitler," Gandhi said, "killed five million Jews. It is the greatest crime of our time. But the Jews should have offered themselves to the butcher<U+2019>s knife. They should have thrown themselves into the sea from cliffs... It would have aroused the world and the people of Germany... As it is they succumbed anyway in their millions."<ref>{{Cite document|year=1950|title = The life of Mahatma Gandhi|author1=Louis Fischer|publisher=Harper|page=348|url=http://books.google.com/?id=pHcGAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA348&q=%22cliffs%22|ref=harv}}</ref></blockquote>

However, Gandhi realised that this level of nonviolence required incredible faith and courage, which he believed everyone did not possess. He therefore advised that everyone need not keep to nonviolence, especially if it were used as a cover for cowardice:

<blockquote>"Gandhi guarded against attracting to his ''satyagraha'' movement those who feared to take up arms or felt themselves incapable of resistance. 'I do believe,' he wrote, 'that where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence.'"<ref>Bondurant, p. 28.</ref></blockquote>

<blockquote>"At every meeting I repeated the warning that unless they felt that in non-violence they had come into possession of a force infinitely superior to the one they had and in the use of which they were adept, they should have nothing to do with non-violence and resume the arms they possessed before. It must never be said of the [[Khudai Khidmatgar]]s that once so brave, they had become or been made cowards under [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan|Badshah Khan]]'s influence. Their bravery consisted not in being good marksmen but in defying death and being ever ready to bare their breasts to the bullets."<ref>Bondurant, p. 139.</ref></blockquote>

Gandhi also came under some political fire for his criticism of those who attempted to achieve independence through more violent means. <!-- His refusal to protest against the hanging of [[Bhagat Singh]], [[Sukhdev]], [[Udham Singh]] and [[Rajguru]] were sources of condemnation among some parties.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}(I've a statement claiming otherwise in [[Bhagat_Singh#cite_note-Frontline-60]] ... it also have a credible citation. Therefore using it here) --> According to a report in the Frontline magazine, he did plead several times for the commutation of the death sentence of [[Bhagat Singh]], [[Rajguru]] and [[Sukhdev]] including a personal visit on 19 March 1931 and in a letter to the Viceroy on the day of their execution, pleading fervently for the commutation.<ref name="Frontline">[http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1808/18080910.htm Frontline - Of Means and Ends] ''by Paresh R. Vaidya''.]</ref>

<!-- Of this criticism, Gandhi stated, "There was a time when people listened to me because I showed them how to give fight to the British without arms when they had no arms...but today I am told that my non-violence can be of no avail against the [Hindu<U+2013>Moslem riots] and, therefore, people should arm themselves for self-defense."<ref>reprinted in ''[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0394714660/ The Essential Gandhi: An Anthology of His Writings on His Life, Work, and Ideas].'', Louis Fischer, ed., 2002 (reprint edition) p. 311.</ref> (already stated this under "Gandhi and the partition of India". This statement seems out of the blue and out of place here) -->

[[Winston Churchill]] said that it was "nauseating" to see Gandhi, "a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a type well-known in the Middle East, striding half-naked up the steps of the Vice-regal palace. .. to parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor".<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/kevin-myers/armistice-day-poppycock-threatens-our-free-speech-1925850.html Kevin Myers: Armistice Day poppycock threatens our free speech], Independent.ie, 28 October 2009</ref>

He continued this argument in a number of articles reprinted in Homer Jack's ''The Gandhi Reader: A Sourcebook of His Life and Writings''. In the first, "Zionism and Anti-Semitism," written in 1938, Gandhi commented upon the 1930s persecution of the Jews in Germany within the context of [[Satyagraha]]. He offered non-violence as a method of combating the difficulties Jews faced in Germany, stating,

<blockquote>If I were a Jew and were born in Germany and earned my livelihood there, I would claim Germany as my home even as the tallest Gentile German might, and challenge him to shoot me or cast me in the dungeon; I would refuse to be expelled or to submit to discriminating treatment. And for doing this I should not wait for the fellow Jews to join me in civil resistance, but would have confidence that in the end the rest were bound to follow my example. If one Jew or all the Jews were to accept the prescription here offered, he or they cannot be worse off than now. And suffering voluntarily undergone will bring them an inner strength and joy...the calculated violence of Hitler may even result in a general massacre of the Jews by way of his first answer to the declaration of such hostilities. But if the Jewish mind could be prepared for voluntary suffering, even the massacre I have imagined could be turned into a day of thanksgiving and joy that Jehovah had wrought deliverance of the race even at the hands of the tyrant. For to the God-fearing, death has no terror.<ref>Jack, Homer. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=XpWO-GoOhVEC&pg=PR13&lpg=PR11&dq=The+Gandhi+Reader:+A+Sourcebook+of+His+Life+and+Writings&sig=mu7B1to2ve7qqIYNmXQMd5jifsY The Gandhi Reader]'', pp. 319<U+2013>20.</ref> </blockquote>

Gandhi was highly criticised for these statements and responded in the article "Questions on the Jews" with "Friends have sent me two newspaper cuttings criticising my appeal to the Jews. The two critics suggest that in presenting non-violence to the Jews as a remedy against the wrong done to them, I have suggested nothing new...what I have pleaded for is renunciation of violence of the heart and consequent active exercise of the force generated by the great renunciation.<ref name="Homer-322">Jack, Homer.

Gandhi commented upon the 1930s persecution of the Jews in Germany within the context of [[Satyagraha]]. In the November 1938 article on the Nazi persecution of the Jews quoted above, he offered non-violence as a solution:

<blockquote>The German persecution of the Jews seems to have no parallel in history. The tyrants of old never went so mad as Hitler seems to have gone. And he is doing it with religious zeal. For he is propounding a new religion of exclusive and militant nationalism in the name of which any inhumanity becomes an act of humanity to be rewarded here and hereafter. The crime of an obviously mad but intrepid youth is being visited upon his whole race with unbelievable ferocity. If there ever could be a justifiable war in the name of and for humanity, a war against Germany, to prevent the wanton persecution of a whole race, would be completely justified. But I do not believe in any war. A discussion of the pros and cons of such a war is therefore outside my horizon or province. But if there can be no war against Germany, even for such a crime as is being committed against the Jews, surely there can be no alliance with Germany. How can there be alliance between a nation which claims to stand for justice and democracy and one which is the declared enemy of both?"<ref>Jack, Homer.

===Vegetarianism===
As a young child, Gandhi experimented with meat-eating. This was due partially to his inherent curiosity as well as his rather persuasive peer and friend [[Sheikh Mehtab]]. The idea of vegetarianism is deeply ingrained in Hindu and [[Jain]] traditions in India, and, in his native land of [[Gujarat]], most Hindus are vegetarian and so are almost all Jains.<ref>Laidlaw, James: Riches and Renunciation. Religion, economy, and society among the Jains, Oxford 1995, pp. 166<U+2013>169 ISBN 0198280319</ref><ref>[http://www.jainstudy.org/jsc4.00-Oct87-JainSoc-Discr.htm Jain Society: Some Discrepancies Between Principles And Practice]. Retrieved on 14 February 2009.</ref> The Gandhi family was no exception. Before leaving for his studies in London, Gandhi made a promise to his mother, [[Putlibai]] and his uncle, [[Becharji Swami]] that he would abstain from eating meat, taking alcohol, and engaging in promiscuity. He held fast to his promise and gained more than a diet: he gained a basis for his life-long philosophies. As Gandhi grew into adulthood, he became a strict [[Lacto vegetarianism|vegetarian]]. He wrote the book ''The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism''<ref>{{Cite book

Gandhi (1869<U+2013>1948)}}</ref> During this period, the young Gandhi became inspired by many great minds and was befriended by the chairman of the London Vegetarian Society, Dr. Josiah Oldfield.

Having also read and admired the work of Henry Stephens Salt, the young Mohandas met and often corresponded with the vegetarian campaigner. Gandhi spent much time advocating vegetarianism during and after his time in London. To Gandhi, a vegetarian diet would not only satisfy the requirements of the body, it would also serve an economic purpose as meat was, and still is, generally more expensive than grains, vegetables, and fruits. Also, many Indians of the time struggled with low income, thus vegetarianism was seen not only as a spiritual practice but also a practical one. He abstained from eating for long periods, using [[fasting]] as a form of political protest. He refused to eat until his death or his demands were met. Gandhi noted in his autobiography that vegetarianism was the beginning of his deep commitment to [[Brahmacharya]]; without total control of the palate, his success in Bramacharya would likely falter.

Gandhi also experimented with [[fruitarianism]], stating in his autobiography, "I decided to live on a pure fruit diet, and that too composed of the cheapest fruit possible ... Raw groundnuts, bananas, dates, lemons and olive oil composed our usual diet."<ref>[[s:The Story of My Experiments with Truth/Part IV/Gokhale's Charity|Gokhale's Charity]], ''My Experiments with Truth'', M.K. Gandhi.</ref> However, late in life he broke his discipline and started taking goat's milk on the advice of his doctor. This lapse of discipline bothered him to his dying day, and he wrote, "The memory of this action even now rankles my breast and fills me with remorse, and I am constantly thinking how to give up goat's milk." He never took dairy products obtained from cows because of his view initially that milk is not the natural diet of man, disgust for [[cow blowing]],<ref>[[s:The Story of My Experiments with Truth/Part V/The Rowlatt Bills and my Dilemma|The Rowlatt Bills and my Dilemma]], ''My Experiments with Truth'', M.K. Gandhi.</ref> and, specifically, because of a vow to his late mother.

===Nai Talim, Basic Education===
''See Main Article [[Nai Talim]]''

''Nai Talim'' is a spiritual principle which states that knowledge and work are not separate. [[Gandhi]] promoted an educational curriculum with the same name based on this pedagogical principle.<ref>{{cite|author=Richards, Glynn|title=[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BGxgNTBmFNEC&pg=PA202&dq=Nai+Talim&num=100 A Source-Book on Modern Hinduism]|publisher=Routledge|year=1996}}</ref>

It can be translated with the phrase 'Basic Education for all'<ref>Basic Education (Nai Talim)</ref>. However, the concept has several layers of meaning. It developed out of Gandhi's experience with the English educational system and with colonialism in general. In that system, he saw that Indian children would be alienated and 'career-based thinking' would become dominant. In addition, it embodied a series of negative outcomes: the disdain for [[manual work]], the development of a new elite class, and the increasing problems of industrialization and urbanization.

The three pillars of Gandhi's pedagogy were its focus on the ''life-long character'' of education, its ''social character'' and its form as a ''holistic process''. For Gandhi, education is 'the moral development of the person', a process that is by definition 'life-long'.<ref>Dinabandhu Dehury: Mahatma Gandhi<U+00B4>s Contribution to Education</ref>

===Brahmacharya===
[[File:Gandhi at Darwen with women.jpg|thumb|Gandhi with textile workers at [[Darwen]], [[Lancashire]], 26 September 1931.]]
When Gandhi was 16 his father became very ill. Being very devoted to his parents, he attended to his father at all times during his illness. However, one night, Gandhi's uncle came to relieve Gandhi for a while. He retired to his bedroom where carnal desires overcame him and he made love to his wife. Shortly afterward a servant came to report that Gandhi's father had just died. Gandhi felt tremendous guilt and never could forgive himself. He came to refer to this event as "double shame." The incident had significant influence in Gandhi becoming [[Celibacy|celibate]] at the age of 36, while still married.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/time100/poc/magazine/mohandas_gandhi12b.html |title=Time magazine people of the century |work=Time|accessdate=12 March 2009}}</ref>

This decision was deeply influenced by the philosophy of [[Brahmacharya]]&nbsp;<U+2014> spiritual and practical purity&nbsp;<U+2014> largely associated with celibacy and [[asceticism]]. Gandhi saw Brahmacharya as a means of becoming close with God and as a primary foundation for self realisation. In his autobiography he tells of his battle against lustful urges and fits of jealousy with his childhood bride, [[Kasturba Gandhi|Kasturba]]. He felt it his personal obligation to remain celibate so that he could learn to love, rather than lust. For Gandhi, Brahmacharya meant "control of the senses in thought, word and deed.".<ref>[[wikilivres:An Autobiography or The Story of my Experiments with Truth|The Story of My Experiments with Truth&nbsp;<U+2014> An Autobiography]], p. 176.</ref>

Towards the end of his life, it became public knowledge that Gandhi had been sharing his bed for a number of years with young women.<ref>Birkett, Dea; Susanne Hoeber Rudolph, Lloyd I Rudolph.

[http://books.google.com/books?id=ldfPVpnItXAC&pg=PA278 The Cultural construction of sexuality]. Routledge, 278. ISBN 0415040132</ref> He explained that he did this for bodily warmth at night and termed his actions as "nature cure". Later in his life he started experimenting with brahmacharya in order to test his self control. His letter to [[Ghanshyam Das Birla|Birla]] in April, 1945 referring to 'women or girls who have been naked with me' indicates that several women were part of his experiments.<ref name=parekh210>Parekh, Bhikhu C.

As part of these experiments, he initially slept with his women associates in the same room but at a distance. Afterwards he started to lie in the same bed with his women disciples and later took to sleeping naked alongside them.<ref name=parekh210/> According to Gandhi active-celibacy meant perfect self control in the presence of the opposite sex. Gandhi conducted his experiments with a number of women such as Abha, the sixteen year old wife of his grandnephew Kanu Gandhi. Gandhi acknowledged "that this experiment is very dangerous indeed", but thought "that it was capable of yielding great results".<ref name="Tidrick, Kathryn 2007">Tidrick, Kathryn (2007). [http://books.google.com/books?id=pp-gZ5OVkuUC&pg=PA302 Gandhi: A Political and Spiritual Life]. I.B. Tauris, pp. 302<U+2013>304. ISBN 1845111664.</ref> His nineteen year old grandniece, Manu Gandhi, too was part of his experiments. Gandhi had earlier written to her father, Jaisukhlal Gandhi, that Manu had started to share his bed so that he may "correct her sleeping posture".<ref name="Tidrick, Kathryn 2007"/> Gandhi saw himself as a mother to these women and would refer to Abha and Manu as "my walking sticks".

Gandhi called Sarladevi, a married woman with children and a devout follower, his "spiritual wife". He later said that he had come close to having sexual relations with her.<ref>Tidrick, Kathryn (2007). [http://books.google.com/books?id=pp-gZ5OVkuUC&pg=PA160 Gandhi: A Political and Spiritual Life]. I. B.Tauris, p. 160. ISBN 1845111664.</ref> He had told a correspondent in March, 1945 that "sleeping together came with my taking up of bramhacharya or even before that"; he said he had experimented with his wife "but that was not enough".<ref name="Tidrick, Kathryn 2007"/> Gandhi felt satisfied with his experiments and wrote to Manu that "I have successfully practiced the eleven vows taken by me. This is the culmination of my striving for last thirty six years. In this yajna I got a glimpse of the ideal truth and purity for which I have been striving".{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Gandhi had to take criticism for his experiments by many of his followers and opponents. His stenographer, R. P. Parasuram, resigned when he saw Gandhi sleeping naked with Manu.<ref name="Wolpert, Stanley 2001">Wolpert, Stanley (2001). [http://books.google.com/books?id=_gw1_OflNgoC&pg=PA226#v=onepage&q&f=false Gandhi's Passion: The Life and Legacy of Mahatma Gandhi]. Oxford University Press, pp. 226<U+2013>227. ISBN 019515634X.</ref> Gandhi insisted that he never felt aroused while he slept beside her, or with Sushila or Abha. "I am sorry" Gandhi said to Parasuram, "you are at liberty to leave me today." [[Nirmal Kumar Bose]], leading anthropologist and close associate of Gandhi, parted company with him in April, 1947 post Gandhi's tour of [[Noakhali district|Noakhali]], where some sort of altercation had taken place between Gandhi and Sushila Nayar in his bedroom at midnight that caused Gandhi to slap his forehead. Bose said, "there was no immorality on part of Gandhi. Moreover Gandhi tried to conquer the feeling of sex by consciously endeavouring to convert himself into a mother of those who were under his case, whether men or women". This maternal emphasis has also been pointed out by [[Dattatreya Balkrushna Kalelkar]], a revolutionary turned disciple of Gandhi.<ref>Ghose, Sankar (1991).

"[[Gandhi's]] relationships with women were, from beginning to end, as pure as mother's milk"</ref>

===Simplicity===
[[File:Gandhi and Mountbatten drink tea.jpg|thumb|Gandhi having tea with [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]]]]
Gandhi earnestly believed that a person involved in public service should lead a [[simple living|simple life]]. He first displayed this principle when he gave up wearing western-style clothing, which he associated with wealth and success. When he returned to India he renounced the western lifestyle he led in South Africa, where he had enjoyed a successful legal practice.

Gandhi dressed to be accepted by the poorest person in India, advocating the use of homespun cloth (''khadi''). He and his followers adopted the practice of weaving their own clothes from thread they themselves spun on a [[charkha]], and encouraged others to do so. While Indian workers were often idle due to unemployment, they had often bought their clothing from industrial manufacturers owned by British interests. The [[Swadeshi Movement]] held that if Indians made their own clothes, it would deal an economic blow to the British establishment in India. Gandhian simplicity was a sign and expression of ''swadeshi'' principles.  Consequently, the ''charkha'' was later incorporated into the flag of the Indian National Congress. He subsequently wore a [[dhoti]] for the rest of his life to express the [[simplicity]] of his life.

The practice of giving up unnecessary expenditure, embracing a simple lifestyle and washing his own clothes, Gandhi called "reducing himself to zero".<ref>[[wikilivres:An Autobiography or The Story of my Experiments with Truth|The Story of My Experiments with Truth&nbsp;<U+2014> An Autobiography]], p. 177.</ref> On one occasion he returned the gifts bestowed to him from the Natals for his diligent service to the community.<ref>[[wikilivres:An Autobiography or The Story of my Experiments with Truth|The Story of My Experiments with Truth&nbsp;<U+2014> An Autobiography]], p. 183.</ref>

Gandhi spent one day of each week in silence. He believed that abstaining from speaking brought him [[inner peace]] and made him a better listener. This influence was drawn from the Hindu principles of ''mauna'' ([[Sanskrit]]:{{lang|sa|<U+092E><U+094C><U+0928><U+0902>}}&nbsp;<U+2014> silence) and ''shanti'' ([[Sanskrit]]:{{lang|sa|<U+0936><U+093E><U+0902><U+0924><U+093F>}}&nbsp;<U+2014> peace). On such days he communicated with others by writing on paper. For three and a half years, from the age of 37, Gandhi refused to read newspapers, claiming that the tumultuous state of world affairs caused him more confusion than his own inner unrest.

After reading [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[Unto This Last]]'', he decided to change his lifestyle and create a commune called ''Phoenix Settlement''.

===Faith===
Gandhi was born a Hindu and practised [[Hinduism]] all his life, deriving most of his principles from Hinduism. As a common Hindu, he believed all religions to be equal, and rejected all efforts to convert him to a different faith. He was an avid theologian and read extensively about all major religions. He had the following to say about Hinduism:

{{quote|Hinduism as I know it entirely satisfies my soul, fills my whole being...When doubts haunt me, when disappointments stare me in the face, and when I see not one ray of light on the horizon, I turn to the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', and find a verse to comfort me; and I immediately begin to smile in the midst of overwhelming sorrow. My life has been full of tragedies and if they have not left any visible and indelible effect on me, I owe it to the teachings of the ''Bhagavad Gita''.}}

<!--attribution required: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/image:Gandhi Smriti.jpg-->

Gandhi wrote a commentary on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]. The Gujarati manuscript was translated into English by Mahadev Desai, who provided an additional introduction and commentary. It was published with a Foreword by Gandhi in 1946.<ref>Desai, Mahadev.

Jim Rankin, editor. The author is listed as M.K. Gandhi; Mahadev Desai, translator. (Dry Bones Press, San Francisco, 1998) ISBN 1-883938-47-3.</ref>

Gandhi believed that at the core of every religion was truth and love (compassion, nonviolence and [[Ethic of reciprocity|the Golden Rule]]). He also questioned what he saw as hypocrisy, malpractices, and dogma in all religions, including his own, and he was a tireless advocate for social reform in religion. Some of his comments on various religions are:

{{quote|Thus if I could not accept Christianity either as a perfect, or the greatest religion, neither was I then convinced of Hinduism being such. Hindu defects were pressingly visible to me. If untouchability could be a part of Hinduism, it could but be a rotten part or an excrescence. I could not understand the ''raison d'<U+00EA>tre'' of a multitude of sects and castes. What was the meaning of saying that the Vedas were the inspired Word of God? If they were inspired, why not also the Bible and the Koran? As Christian friends were endeavouring to convert me, so were Muslim friends. Abdullah Seth had kept on inducing me to study Islam, and of course he had always something to say regarding its beauty.|[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth|Gandhi's autobiography]]}}

{{quote|As soon as we lose the moral basis, we cease to be religious. There is no such thing as religion over-riding morality. Man, for instance, cannot be untruthful, cruel or incontinent and claim to have God on his side.}}

{{quote|The sayings of [[Muhammad]] are a treasure of wisdom, not only for Muslims but for all of mankind.}}

{{quote|I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians.  Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.}}

{{quote|God has no religion.}}

Later in his life, when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied, "Yes I am. I am also a Christian, a Muslim, a Buddhist and a Jew."

In spite of their deep reverence to each other, Gandhi and [[Rabindranath Tagore]] engaged in protracted debates more than once. These debates exemplify the philosophical differences between the two most famous Indians at the time. On 15 January 1934, an earthquake hit [[Bihar]] and caused extensive damage and loss of life. Gandhi maintained this was because of the sin committed by upper caste Hindus by not letting untouchables in their temples (Gandhi was committed to the cause of improving the fate of untouchables, referring to them as [[Harijan]]s, people of [[Krishna]]). Tagore vehemently opposed Gandhi's stance, maintaining that an earthquake can only be caused by natural forces, not moral reasons, however repugnant the practice of untouchability may be.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiatogether.org/2003/may/rvw-gndhtgore.htm |title=Overview of debates between Gandhi and Tagore |publisher=Indiatogether.org |date= |accessdate=12 March 2009}}</ref>

Gandhi took a keen interest in [[theosophy]]. He empathised with theosophy's message of "universal brotherhood and consequent toleration", as he put it in 1926.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gandhiserve.org/information/questions_and_answers/faq9/faq9.html |title=What about Gandhi and theosophy? |publisher=Gandhiserve.org |date=1948-01-30 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}</ref>

His idea was that true [[Swaraj|self-rule]] in a country means that every person rules his or herself and that there is no state which enforces laws upon the people.<ref>Murthy, Srinivas.

Rather than a system where rights are enforced by a higher authority, people are self-governed by mutual responsibilities. On returning from South Africa, when Gandhi received a letter asking for his participation in writing a world charter for human rights, he responded saying, "in my experience, it is far more important to have a charter for human duties."<ref>[[Eknath Easwaran|Easwaran, Eknath]].

==Literary works==
[[File:Young India.png|thumb|''Young India'', a journal published by Gandhi]]
Gandhi was a prolific writer. For decades he edited several newspapers including ''[[Harijan]]'' in Gujarati, in [[Hindi]] and in the English language; ''[[Indian Opinion]]'' while in South Africa and, ''[[Young India]]'', in English, and Navajivan, a Gujarati monthly, on his return to India. Later, Navajivan was also published in Hindi.<ref>[http://www.lifepositive.com/Spirit/masters/mahatma-gandhi/journalist.asp Peerless Communicator] by V.N. Narayanan. Life Positive Plus, October<U+2013>December 2002</ref> In addition, he wrote letters almost every day to individuals and newspapers.

Gandhi also wrote several books including his autobiography, ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth|An Autobiography of My Experiments with Truth]] ((Gujar<U+0101>t<U+012B> "<U+0AB8><U+0AA4><U+0ACD><U+0AAF><U+0AA8><U+0ABE> <U+0AAA><U+0ACD><U+0AB0><U+0AAF><U+0ACB><U+0A97><U+0ACB> <U+0A85><U+0AA5><U+0AB5><U+0ABE> <U+0A86><U+0AA4><U+0ACD><U+0AAE><U+0A95><U+0AA5><U+0ABE>"))'',  ''Satyagraha in South Africa'' about his struggle there, ''[[Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule]]'', a political pamphlet, and a paraphrase in Gujarati of [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[Unto This Last]]''.<ref name="Unto this last">{{Cite book|last= Gandhi |first= M.

He also wrote extensively on vegetarianism, diet and health, religion, social reforms, etc. Gandhi usually wrote in Gujarati, though he also revised the Hindi and English translations of his books.

Gandhi's complete works were published by the Indian government under the name ''[[s:The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi|The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi]]'' in the 1960s. The writings comprise about 50,000 pages published in about a hundred volumes. In 2000, a revised edition of the complete works sparked a controversy, as Gandhian followers argue that the government incorporated the changes for political purposes. The Indian government later withdrew the revised edition.<ref>[http://www.gandhiserve.org/cwmg/cwmg_controversy.html Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi (CWMG) Controversy] (gandhiserve)</ref>

The word ''[[Mahatma]]'', while often mistaken for Gandhi's given name in the West, is taken from the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] words ''maha'' meaning ''Great'' and ''atma'' meaning ''Soul''. [[Rabindranath Tagore]] is said to have accorded or popularised the title for Gandhi.<ref>Dutta, Krishna and Andrew Robinson, ''Rabindranath Tagore: An Anthology'', p. 2.</ref> In his autobiography, Gandhi nevertheless explains that he never valued the title, and was often pained by it.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Desai, Mahadev H. |title=Autobiography: the story of my experiments with truth |publisher=Dover |location=Mineola, N.Y |year=1983 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=OXoRs7Kxs_YC&pg=PR1|isbn=0-486-24593-4 |page=viii}}</ref>

In his early years, the former [[President of South Africa]] [[Nelson Mandela]] was a follower of the non-violent resistance philosophy of Gandhi.<ref name="Mandela-2000" /> Bhana and Vahed commented on these events as "Gandhi inspired succeeding generations of South African activists seeking to end White rule. This legacy connects him to [[Nelson Mandela]]...in a sense Mandela completed what Gandhi started."<ref>Surendra Bhana and Goolam Vahed, ''The Making of a Political Reformer: Gandhi in South Africa, 1893<U+2013>1914.''

Gandhi's life and teachings inspired many who specifically referred to Gandhi as their mentor or who dedicated their lives to spreading Gandhi's ideas. In Europe, [[Romain Rolland]] was the first to discuss Gandhi in his 1924 book ''Mahatma Gandhi,'' and Brazilian [[anarchist]] and [[feminist]] [[Maria Lacerda de Moura]] wrote about Gandhi in her work on pacifism. In 1931, notable European physicist [[Albert Einstein]] exchanged written letters with Gandhi, and called him "a role model for the generations to come" in a later writing about him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gandhiserve.org/streams/einstein.html |title=Einstein on Gandhi |publisher=Gandhiserve.org |date=18 October 1931 |accessdate=12 March 2009}}</ref> [[Lanza del Vasto]] went to India in 1936 intending to live with Gandhi; he later returned to Europe to spread Gandhi's philosophy and founded the [[Community of the Ark]] in 1948 (modelled after Gandhi's ashrams). [[Madeleine Slade]] (known as "Mirabehn") was the daughter of a British admiral who spent much of her adult life in India as a devotee of Gandhi.

In addition, the British musician [[John Lennon]] referred to Gandhi when discussing his views on non-violence.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/8898300/lennon_lives_forever Lennon Lives Forever]. ''Rolling Stone''. Retrieved on 20 May 2007.</ref> At the [[Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival]] in 2007, former U.S. Vice-President and environmentalist [[Al Gore]] spoke of Gandhi's influence on him.<ref>[http://www.exchange4media.com/Cannes/2007/fullstory2007.asp?section_id=13&news_id=26524&tag=21387&pict=2 Of Gandhigiri and Green Lion, Al Gore wins hearts at Cannes]. Taken from ''exchange4media.com''. Retrieved on 23 June 2007.</ref> Finally, prior to becoming President of the United States, then-Senator [[Barack Obama]] noted that:
<blockquote>Throughout my life, I have always looked to Mahatma Gandhi as an inspiration, because he embodies the kind of transformational change that can be made when ordinary people come together to do extraordinary things. That is why his portrait hangs in my Senate office: to remind me that real results will come not just from Washington<U+2014>they will come from the people.<ref>{{Cite web|author=|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2008071260521800.htm&date=2008/07/12/&prd=th& |title=Obama reluctant to seek changes in nuclear deal  |work=The Hindu |date=7 December 2008 |accessdate=12 March 2009}}</ref></blockquote>
Obama at the Wakefield High School speech in Sept 2009, said that his biggest inspiration came from Mahatma Gandhi. It was when a question posed on him as 'who was the one person, dead or live, that he would choose to dine with?' and his quick reply was 'Gandhi!'. He continued and said that <U+2013> "He's somebody I find a lot of inspiration in. He inspired Dr. King with his message of nonviolence. He ended up doing so much and changed the world just by the power of his ethics."

The [[Mahatma Gandhi District]] in [[Houston]], Texas, United States, an ethnic Indian enclave, is named after Gandhi. The district officially received its named on 16 January 2010 when the City of Houston held a naming ceremony.<ref name="MorenoCelebrates">Moreno, Jenalia.

===National holidays===
Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is a [[national holiday in India]], [[Gandhi Jayanti]]. On 15 June 2007, it was announced that the "[[United Nations General Assembly]]" has "unanimously adopted" a resolution declaring 2 October as "the [[International Day of Non-Violence]]."<ref>{{Cite news|first=Nilova| last=Chaudhury| url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/storypage/storypage.aspx?id=54580f5e-15a0-4aaf-baa3-8f403b5688fa&&Headline=October+2+is+Int'l+Non-Violence+Day| title=2 October is global non-violence day| work=hindustantimes.com|publisher=Hindustan Times| date=15 June 2007| accessdate=15 June 2007}}</ref> India observes  30 January  the day of his assassination, as [[Martyrs' Day (India)|Martyr's Day]], to commemorate those who gave up their lives in service of the Indian nation.

On 30 January every year, on the anniversary of the death of Mahatma Gandhi, in schools of many countries is observed the [[School Day of Non-violence and Peace]] ([[DENIP]]), founded in Spain in 1964. In countries with a Southern Hemisphere school calendar, it can be observed on 30 March or thereabouts.

===Awards===
''Time'' magazine named Gandhi the [[Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] in 1930. Gandhi was also the runner-up to [[Albert Einstein]] as "[[Person of the Century]]"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/time100/leaders/profile/gandhi.html |title= The Time 100 |accessdate= 3 March 2009 |work=Time Magazine  Online}}</ref>  at the end of 1999. ''Time Magazine'' named [[14th Dalai Lama|The 14th Dalai Lama]], [[Lech Wa<U+0142><U+0119>sa]], [[Martin Luther King]], [[Cesar Chavez]], [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]], [[Desmond Tutu]], and [[Nelson Mandela]] as ''Children of Gandhi'' and his spiritual heirs to non-violence.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,993026,00.html The Children Of Gandhi]. ''Time''. Retrieved on 21 April 2007.</ref> The [[Government of India]] awards the annual [[Mahatma Gandhi Peace Prize]] to distinguished social workers, world leaders and citizens. [[Nelson Mandela]], the leader of South Africa's struggle to eradicate racial discrimination and segregation, is a prominent non-Indian recipient.

Gandhi never received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], although he was nominated five times between 1937 and 1948, including the first-ever nomination by the [[American Friends Service Committee]],<ref>[http://www.afsc.org/about/nobel/past-nominations.htm AFSC's Past Nobel Nominations].</ref> though he made the short list only twice, in 1937 and 1947.<ref name=Tonnesson>{{Cite web|last=T<U+00F8>nnesson|first= <U+00D8>yvind |publisher=nobelprize.org| title=Mahatma Gandhi, the Missing Laureate|date=1 December 1999|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/index.html}}</ref> Decades later, the Nobel Committee publicly declared its regret for the omission, and admitted to deeply divided nationalistic opinion denying the award.<ref name="T<U+00F8>nnesson"/> Gandhi was nominated in 1948 but was assassinated before nominations closed. That year, the committee chose not to award the peace prize stating that "there was no suitable living candidate" and later research shows that the possibility of awarding the prize posthumously  to Gandhi was discussed and that the reference to no suitable living candidate was to Gandhi.<ref name=Tonnesson/> When the [[14th Dalai Lama]] was awarded the Prize in 1989, the chairman of the committee said that this was "in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi."<ref name=Tonnesson/>

===Film and literature===
Mahatma Gandhi has been portrayed in film, literature, and in the theatre. [[Ben Kingsley]] portrayed Gandhi in the 1982 film ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'', which was awarded the [[Academy Award]] for Best Picture.
