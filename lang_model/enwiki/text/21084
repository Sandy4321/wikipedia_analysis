'''Fauna & Flora International''' (FFI), formerly the '''Fauna and Flora Preservation Society''', is an international conservation charity and [[non-governmental organization]].

==History==
FFI was originally founded in 1903 as the '''Society for the Preservation of the Wild Fauna of the Empire''' by a group of [[United Kingdom|British]] naturalists and [[United States|American]] statesmen in [[Africa]]. It was then called the '''Fauna Preservation Society''', before being renamed ''[[Fauna]] and [[Flora]] Preservation Society'' in 1981. The goal of the society was to safeguard the future of southern Africa<U+2019>s large mammal populations, which had declined alarmingly due to over-hunting and habitat encroachment. Working in tandem with landowners, government and sport hunters, the Society helped pass legislation which controlled hunting in vast stretches of [[East Africa]] and [[South Africa]]. This ultimately paved the way for the formation of [[National Park]]s, such as [[Kruger National Park]] and [[Serengeti National Park]].

FFI has been referred to by many historians as the world's first conservation society, and the society's early work in Africa was also trend-setting in [[ecotourism]]. The organization also played a key role in establishing much of today<U+2019>s global conservation infrastructure <U+2013> including The [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN), The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF), and the [[Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna]] (CITES).

==Activities==
FFI has a seven-step approach to conserving biodiversity:
#Building local capacity for conservation
#Integrating biodiversity and human needs
#Direct protection of species and habitats
#Securing land for conservation
#Emergency response to conservation needs
#Influencing policy and the practice of conservation
#Bridging the gap between business and biodiversity

In line with its seven-step approach to conservation, Fauna & Flora International has recently endorsed the [[Forests Now Declaration]], which calls for new market based mechanisms to protect tropical forests.

==Structure==
Fauna and Flora International is constituted under English law as a company limited by guarantee<ref>Registered Company Number 2677068</ref> and is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] with its head office in Cambridge.<ref>{{EW charity|1011102}}</ref> FFI has sister organisations in the U.S. and Australia, and a subsidiary in [[Singapore]].

The logo of the society is the [[Arabian oryx]], after the very successful [[Arabian oryx reintroduction#Operation Oryx|Operation Oryx]], a flagship Arabian oryx captive breeding project undertaken by the society.

[[Queen Elizabeth II]] is FFI's Patron and [[Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands]] is the President of the organization. FFI also has a number of high profile Vice Presidents including [[Sir David Attenborough]], [[David Bellamy]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Charlotte Uhlenbroek]], [[Rove McManus]], and [[Lord Browne of Madingley]].<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/nov/13/stephen-fry-last-chance-to-see</ref>

==Significant landmarks==
*1903 - First publication of the society<U+2019>s journal, the precursor of ''Oryx - The International Journal of Conservation''
*1962 - [[Arabian oryx reintroduction#Operation Oryx|Operation Oryx]] helps rescue the Arabian oryx from [[extinction]] through a [[captive breeding]] program, with successful reintroductions into the wild in [[Jordan]], [[Oman]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]. This was one of the world's first successful captive breeding and reintroduction efforts for an endangered species.
*1966 - [[Peter Scott]], Chairman of ''IUCN Species Survival Commission'', becomes Chairman of FFI and devises the [[IUCN Red List|Red Data Book]]s, a systematic study of all endangered species.
*1971 - Launch of the 100% Fund (now the ''Flagship Species Fund''), set up to support small-scale projects where urgent conservation action is needed to protect endangered species around the world.
*1972 - [[Gerald Durrell]]'s initiative caused the society to start the [[World Conference on Breeding Endangered Species in Captivity as an Aid to their Survival]] at [[Jersey]], the first knowledge sharing among scientists regarding ideas of captive breeding.
*2000 - [[Alexander Peal]], President of the ''Society for the Conservation of Nature of Liberia'', whose work FFI has supported since 1996, receives the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]], one of the highest honours for a conservationist.
