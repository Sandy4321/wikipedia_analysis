==Background==
The [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]] scripted into Backlash on the [[WWE Raw|Raw]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]] was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Fatal Four Way match]] for the [[WWE Championship]], a standard match involving four wrestlers between [[John Cena]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], [[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Randy Orton]]. At the [[Royal Rumble (2007)|Royal Rumble]] in January, Michaels was one of the final two participants in the [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble match]], a multi-competitor [[Professional wrestling match types|match type]] in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner before being eliminated by [[The Undertaker]].<ref name="2007rumble">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/2007/matches/35535102/results/|title=A Phenom-enal Rumble|date=2007-01-28|first=Louie|last=Dee|publisher =WWE|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/matches|title=Royal Rumble 2007 results|date=2007-01-28|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref> On the February 5, 2007 edition of ''Raw'', Michaels earned the right to become the number-one contender to the WWE Championship at [[WrestleMania 23|WrestleMania]] after defeating Edge and Orton in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]], a standard match involving three wrestlers.<ref name="February 5">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/02052007|title=Tickets punched for WrestleMania|date=2007-02-05|first=Brett|last=Hoffman|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref> At WrestleMania, Cena defeated Michaels to retain the WWE Championship, after  [[Professional wrestling holds#STS|wrapping his arm around the neck of Michaels]] in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Sleeper hold|sleeper hold]], a submission referred to as an STFU.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wrestlemania23/matches/39161841/results/|title=Detroit, Champ City|date=2007-04-01| first=Louie|last=Dee|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref> On the April 9 edition of ''Raw'', a standard match between Michaels and Orton to determine the number-one contender to the WWE Championship ended in a [[No contest (boxing)|no-contest]], after both men's shoulders were on the mat while they were pinning one another.

Honorary General Manager Michael Pena, from the [[Make-a-Wish Foundation]], however, announced that Michaels, Orton, and Edge would face Cena for the title at Backlash in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Fatal Four-Way match]], a standard match involving four wrestlers.<ref name="April 9">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/04092007|title=Redemption|date=2007-10-28|first=Noah|last=Starr|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-11-16 }}</ref>

Another rivalry leading up to the event was between [[The Undertaker]] and [[Dave Batista|Batista]] over the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]. At the Royal Rumble in January, The Undertaker won the 2007 Royal Rumble match. As a result, he was given the right to a title match at WrestleMania for any of WWE's three major championships ([[ECW Championship|ECW World]], World Heavyweight, or WWE).<ref name="2007rumble"/> On the February 5 edition of ''Raw'', Undertaker teased all three World Champions (Bobby Lashley, Batista, and John Cena).

The main rivalry on the [[ECW on Syfy|ECW]] brand was between [[Bobby Lashley]] and [[Team McMahon]] ([[Eddie Fatu|Umaga]], [[Vince McMahon|Vince]] and [[Shane McMahon]]), in which Lashley and Vince were feuding over the ECW World Championship. The rivalry started on the February 26 edition of ''Raw'', when Lashley was selected by [[Donald Trump]] to compete at WrestleMania 23. Lashley was selected to compete against Vince's representative, Umaga, in  [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|Hair vs. Hair match]], a match in which the loser or the loser's representative would have to get his head shaved bald.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/02262007|title=Billionaire's brawlers|date=2007-02-26|first=Noah|last=Starr|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref> At WrestleMania, Lashley defeated Umaga, and after the match, Trump and Lashley shaved Vince's head bald.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wrestlemania23/matches/39161842/results/|title=The 'mane' event|date=2007-04-01|first=Craig|last=Tello|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref> On the April 9 edition of ''Raw'', Shane challenged Lashley to a Hair vs. Title match for the ECW World Championship. Shane got himself intentionally disqualified, but did not get his head shaved. After the match, Umaga and Vince and Shane attacked Lashley. After the beating, Vince announced that Lashley would have to defend the ECW World Championship against Team McMahon at Backlash in a 3-on-1 [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|Handicap match]], a match consisting of one team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with numerical superiority such as three against two, or three against one.<ref name="April 9"/>

Cade and Murdoch controlled a majority of the match; however, The Hardys won the bout when Matt pinned Murdoch after a [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Twist of Fate|Twist Of Fate]], which was followed by Jeff Hardy's [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#High-angle senton bomb|Swanton Bomb]].<ref name="hardyz">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/backlash/history/2007/matches/3960652/results/|title=The Hardys survive|date=2007-04-29|first=Andrew|last=Rote|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref>

The match that followed was [[Melina Perez|Melina]] versus [[Mickie James]] for the [[WWE Women's Championship]]. The match was short lived, as Melina performed an [[DDT_(professional_wrestling)#Swinging reverse DDT|Inverted DDT]] upon Mickie James and pinned her to retain the WWE Women's Championship.<ref name="melina">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/backlash/history/2007/matches/396065212/results/|title=Melina on top|date=2007-04-29|first=Noah|last=Starr|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref> The third match was between [[Chris Benoit]] and [[Montel Vontavious Porter]] for the [[WWE United States Championship]]. Benoit and MVP struggled throughout the match, attempting to gain the upper hand. In the end, Benoit pinned MVP after a series of coucnters from both superstars, culminating in a [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Cradle|small package]] to win the match and retain the WWE United States Championship.<ref name="benoit">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/backlash/history/2007/matches/396065211/results/|title=Rabid resiliency|date=2007-04-29|first=Lennie|last=Difino|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref>

===Main event matches===
[[Image:Shane-backlash.jpg|thumb|left|215px|[[Shane McMahon]] in the ring]]
The 3-on-1 Handicap [[ECW Championship|ECW World Championship]] match between champion [[Bobby Lashley]] and [[Team McMahon]] ([[Eddie Fatu|Umaga]], [[Vince McMahon|Vince]] and [[Shane McMahon]]) was next. Near the end of the match, Shane hit Lashley with the title belt, which was followed by Umaga landing a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Splash|top rope splash]] to Lashley. Umaga then [[Tag team|tagged]] in Vince, who attempted to pin Lashley. Lashley, however, kicked out. Vince then tagged in Umaga, who once again executed a diving splash on Lashley. After being tagged in again, Vince pinned Lashley to win the ECW World Championship and the match for his team.<ref name="Backlash - Lashley vs McMahons and Umaga"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/history/ecwchampionship/042907mcmahon|title=Mr. McMahon's first ECW Championship reign|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref>

The following match was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Last Man Standing match|Last Man Standing Match]] for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] between [[The Undertaker]] and [[Dave Batista|Batista]]. One [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Spot|spot]] in the match saw Undertaker perform a [[leg drop]] on Batista and through an announce table. Towards the end of the match, the two fought up the entrance ramp, where Batista gave a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spear]] to The Undertaker off the stage. Neither man was able to get to their feet before the referee counted to ten; as a result, the match was declared a no-contest. Due to WWE regulations, a title can not change hands in a Last Man Standing match via a no contest, so The Undertaker retained his title.<ref name="Backlash - Taker vs Batista"/>

Next was the main event, which saw [[John Cena]] defend the [[WWE Championship]] against [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], [[Randy Orton]], and [[Shawn Michaels]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Fatal Four-Way match]]. During the opening minutes of the match, Michaels performed a [[moonsault]] from the top turnbuckle onto Cena, Edge, and Orton outside the ring. Near the end of the match, Orton attempted to [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|RKO]] Cena. Cena, however, pushed Orton into Edge, which made Edge execute a Spear to Orton. Cena then performed an [[Professional wrestling throws#Fireman's carry takeover|FU]] to Edge. When Cena turned around, Michaels [[superkick]]ed Cena. When Cena fell, he landed on Orton and the referee counted the pinfall. Cena won the match and retained the WWE Championship.<ref name="Backlash - Fatal Four-Way"/>

Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch continued their rivalry with The Hardys until the two teams had a rematch at Judgment Day for the World Tag Team Championship, which The Hardys won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/history/2007/matches/41244022111/hardysvscademurdoch05202007/|title='By the book' couldn't beat the Hardys|date=2007-05-20|first=Corey|last=Clayton| publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref> Chris Benoit and Montel Vontavious Porter also continued their rivalry for the WWE United States Championship, which led to a [[Professional wrestling match types#Two out of three falls match|best 2 out of 3 falls match]] at Judgment Day, which Porter won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/history/2007/matches/41244023/results/|title=Third time's the golden charm for MVP|date=2007-05-20|first=Mike|last=McAvennie|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/unitedstates/4729814|title=Montel Vontavious Porter's first United States Championship reign|publisher=WWE| accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref>

On the May 11 edition of ''SmackDown!'', The Undertaker defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Batista in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Steel cage match]], a match fought within a cage formed by placing four sheets of mesh metal around, in, or against the edges of a wrestling ring. Both men escaped the steel cage at the same time, and The Undertaker was therefore declared still the champion. After the match, [[Mark Henry]] returned and attacked The Undertaker.
