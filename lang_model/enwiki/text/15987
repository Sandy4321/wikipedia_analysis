'''''Mack & Mabel''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with a book by [[Michael Stewart (playwright)|Michael Stewart]] and music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]].

The plot has as its origin the tumultuous relationship between [[Hollywood]] director [[Mack Sennett]] and [[Mabel Normand]] (transformed from an artist's model to a waitress from [[Flatbush]], [[Brooklyn]] for the musical), who became one of his biggest stars.  In a series of flashbacks, Sennett relates the glory days of [[Keystone Studios]] from 1911, when he discovered Normand and cast her in dozens of his early "two-reelers", through his invention of Sennett's Bathing Beauties and the [[Keystone Cops]] to Mabel's death from [[tuberculosis]] in 1930.

Although the show's original production did not catch on, subsequent productions, especially in Britain, have had success.  The score of the show is much admired. 

==Original production==
The show had pre-Broadway tryouts in [[San Diego]] and then [[Los Angeles]], opening to rave reviews and brisk box office sales in both cities.  Buoyed by the critical acclaim and initial public enthusiasm for the show, Herman and company ignored a number of critical warning signs.  

[[Image:Mack&Mabel.jpg|left|frame|Preston and Peters]]Neither Sennett nor Normand were particularly lovable characters, and their story was darker than that usually found in a musical.  As played by [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]] and [[Bernadette Peters]], the age difference between them was far greater than that in real life, and too noticeable on stage to ignore.  Director and choreographer [[Gower Champion]] devised a number of eye-catching visual effects and spectacular dance sequences, but their brightness proved to be too great a contrast with the somber mood of the piece.  His concept of setting the action in the corner of a huge studio soundstage created problems with the set and limited the staging to the extent that it was seen as static and boring.  Most importantly, audiences didn't want to invest two-and-a-half hours in a musical where the heroine dies tragically at the end.

Efforts were made to resolve the problems at [[The Muny]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], but the more changes that were made, the worse matters became.  By the time the show opened at the [[Majestic Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on [[October 6]] [[1974]], it was less successful than it had been four months earlier.  Reviews ranged from fair to middling, and the show closed after only 66 performances, Herman's first major flop.

Despite the reviews and short run, the show received eight [[Tony Award]] nominations - for the book, direction, set and costume design, choreography, lead actor, lead actress, and the production itself as Best Musical.  Ironically, Herman - whose melodic score had received the best notices - was snubbed.  Herman was deeply disappointed, since the project had been one of his favorites (and remains so, even now), and he felt producer [[David Merrick]] had done little to promote it.  Despite its failure, the show managed to develop a large cult following.

==Subsequent productions==
[[Image:Mack&Mabel2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|1995 London Album Cover]]
In 1982, when [[United Kingdom|British]] ice-skating team [[Torvill and Dean]] won the [[gold medal]] for ice dance in the [[World Figure Skating Championships]], they performed to the overture from the original cast album.  The event was broadcast by [[BBC Television]], and the station was inundated with calls from viewers wanting to know where they could find the music.  Demand was so great that the album was re-released in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where it shot to #6 on the charts, unprecedented for a show album, especially one ten years old.

Interest was such that in 1988, a one-time concert version - featuring [[George Hearn]], [[Georgia Brown (English singer)|Georgia Brown]] and [[Tommy Tune]] - was staged for charity at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].  Despite ecstatic reviews, it wasn't until seven years later, on [[November 7]] [[1995]], that a full-scale production opened at the [[Piccadilly Theatre]] in London, and ran for 270 performances. The book had been dramatically revised, and now had a happy ending, with Mabel back in Mack's arms at the final curtain. The cast, directed by Paul Kerryson and choreographed by [[Michael Smuin]], included [[Howard McGillin]] as Mack and Caroline O'Connor as Mabel, Kathryn Evans, and Alan Mosley.   

The show was revived once again at the [[Watermill Theatre]], Newbury in [[England]]. [[David Soul]] starred alongside Anna Jane Casey in the small scale production (with only eleven performers), which ran for a limited season between March and June 2005.  The show did not end there however, as it toured the UK from January 2006 prior to a [[West End of London|West End]] transfer, where it played the [[Criterion Theatre]] from [[April 10]] [[2006]] until [[July 1]] [[2006]]. It featured the trademark style of director [[John Doyle (director)|John Doyle]], with the cast members, except for Soul, playing musical instruments as well as acting and singing.

==Synopsis==
[[Silent movie]] director Mack Sennet returns to his old film studio in Brooklyn in 1938.  Things have changed considerably since he was last there -- he sees a group of actors shooting a scene for a talkie.  Mack reminisces about "when he ran the show", the glorious era of silent movies, with references to his Bathing Beauties and [[Keystone Cops]] ("Movies Were Movies").

A series of flashbacks returns Mack to 1911, and chronicles the story of Mack's involvement - both professionally and romantically - with one of the biggest stars of his movies, Mabel Normand.  When Mabel, a delicatessan worker, delivers a sandwich to Lottie, the actress that Mack is filming, Lottie is unable to pay, and Mabel reacts violently.  Mabel's behaviour catches Mack's eye, and he thinks she has potential as an actress.  He offers her a part in his next film.  She initially refuses, but when she looks back on the offer, she is dazzled by the career prospects ("Look What Happened To Mabel").

Mabel is very successful, and later, along with Mack's two accountants, Kleiman and Fox, who are helping to finance his projects, the film company moves to a new, larger studio ("Big Time").  Meanwhile, Mabel has become attracted to Mack.  When he comes up behind her while reciting an improvised poem, Mabel invites him into her train compartment for a meal.  Things escalate, and Mabel persuades a very reluctant Mack to take part in a mock wedding ceremony.  But Mack has no time for romance ("I Won't Send Roses"), and, when he wakes up the next morning in bed with Mabel, he leaves in a hurry.  Mabel, out of her love for Mack, resolves to do things his way ("I Won't Send Roses" (Reprise)).

Eventually, Mabel wants to move on from comedy to star in some serious dramas.  But Mack is only interested in comedy ("I Wanna Make The World Laugh") and tries to discourage her.  Mabel meets another movie director, William Desmond Taylor, who agrees to cast her in serious roles.  After a fiery argument with Mack, Mabel goes off to dinner with Taylor and finally leaves Mack altogether ("Wherever He Ain't").  Mack is confident that he can manage without Mabel. He made a star out of one ordinary girl, and he can make a star out of another.  This results in his creation of the Bathing Beauties ("Hundreds of Girls").

Mabel eventually returns to Mack of her own accord and is welcomed with open arms by the entire film company ("When Mabel Comes In The Room").  Mack agrees to film Mabel's new, serious drama, "Molly", at his studio.  But he attempts to jazz it up with a new comic creation, The Keystone Cops ("Hit 'Em On The Head"), and she returns to Taylor.  Later, Mack sees Mabel again as she is preparing to embark on a ship with Taylor.  Taylor shows up and Mack leaves, then Taylor, sensing that Mabel might still have feelings for Mack, persuades Mabel, who is complaining of tiredness, to take heroin, saying it is a pick-me-up, which works with the magic words, "Bye, Mack!".  Mabel is still in love with Mack, in spite of everything he has done to her ("Time Heals Everything").

Back at the studio, a happy Mack has realized the potential of sound in his movies, with singing and dancing.  Lottie Ames, another actress in Mack's company, has become a star following Mabel's demise, while Mabel has become a full-time drug addict ("Tap Your Troubles Away"), and her reputation is ruined.  To add further injury, her lover, William Desmond Taylor, is murdered.  By the time Mack is willing to try to patch things up between him and Mabel, it is too late - she's dead.  But musicals must end happily, so Mack imagines a happier ending to their story ("I Promise You A Happy Ending").
