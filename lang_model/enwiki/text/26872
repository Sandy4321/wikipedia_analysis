[[Image:Diegovel<U+00E1>zquezselfportrait.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Vel<U+00E1>zquez's 1643 [[self-portrait]]]]

'''Diego Rodr<U+00ED>guez de Silva y Vel<U+00E1>zquez''' (June, 1599 &ndash; [[August 6]], [[1660]]), commonly referred to as '''Diego Vel<U+00E1>zquez''', was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Art|painter]], the leading artist in the [[Noble court|court]] of King [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]]. He was an individualistic artist of the contemporary [[baroque]] period, important as a portrait artist. His two visits to [[Italy]] while part of the Spanish court are well documented. In addition to numerous renditions of scenes of historical and cultural significance, he created scores of portraits of the Spanish royal family, other notable European figures, and commoners, culminating in the production of his masterpiece, ''[[Las Meninas]]'' (1656).

Starting in the first quarter of the [[19th century|nineteenth century]], Vel<U+00E1>zquez's artwork proved a model for the [[realism (arts)|realist]] and [[impressionism|impressionist]] painters, in particular [[<U+00C9>douard Manet]]. Since that time, more [[modern]] artists, including Spain's [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Francisco Goya]] and [[Salvador Dal<U+00ED>]], have paid tribute to Vel<U+00E1>zquez by recreating several of his most famous works.

==Early life==
Vel<U+00E1>zquez, born in [[Seville]], [[Andalusia]] early in June 1599, and baptized on [[June 6]], was the son of Juan Rodr<U+00ED>guez de Silva, a lawyer of noble [[Portugal|Portuguese]] descent, and Jer<U+00F3>nima Vel<U+00E1>zquez, a member of Seville's [[Hidalgo (disambiguation)|''hidalgo'']] class, an order of minor [[aristocracy]] (it was a Spanish custom, in order to maintain a legacy of maternal inheritance, for the eldest male to adopt the name of his mother). He was educated by his parents to fear God and, intended for a learned profession, received good training in [[language]]s and [[philosophy]]. But he showed an early gift for art; consequently, he began to study under [[Francisco Herrera the Elder|Francisco de Herrera]], a vigorous painter who disregarded the Italian influence of the early Seville school. Vel<U+00E1>zquez remained with him for one year. It was probably from Herrera that he learned to use brushes with long bristles.

After leaving Herrera's studio when he was 11 years old, Vel<U+00E1>zquez began to serve as an apprentice under the pedantic [[Francisco Pacheco]], a founded artist and teacher in Seville. Though considered a generally dull, commonplace painter, at times Pacheco would express a simple, direct realism that is in contradiction to the style of [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]] that he was taught. Vel<U+00E1>zquez remained in Pacheco's school for five years, studying proportion and perspective and witnessing the trends in the literary and artistic circles of Seville.

==To Madrid (early period)==
[[Image:DiegoVelazquez Viejafriendohuevos.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''Vieja friendo huevos'' (1618, English: ''An Old Woman Frying Eggs'')]]

===The birth of realism in Seville===
Vel<U+00E1>zquez fell in love with Pacheco's daughter Juana, whom he married in 1618 with Pacheco's hearty approval. The young painter set himself to begin recreating in his art common things&mdash;earthenware jars of the country people, birds, fish, fruit and flowers of the marketplace. A notable piece from this early period of depicting common Spanish life is ''Vieja friendo huevos'' (1618, English: ''An Old Woman Frying Eggs'').
By the early 1620s his position and reputation were assured in Seville; Vel<U+00E1>zquez's wife in these years bore him two daughters&mdash;his only known family. The younger, Ignacia, died in infancy, while the elder, Francisca, in due time married [[Bautista del Mazo]], a painter.

Vel<U+00E1>zquez produced other notable works in this time. Sacred subjects are depicted in ''Adoraci<U+00F3>n de los Reyes'' (1619, English: ''The Adoration of the Magi''), and ''Jes<U+00FA>s y los peregrinos de Ema<U+00FA>s'' (1626, English: ''Christ and the Pilgrims of Emmaus''), both of which begin to express his more pointed and careful realism.

===Madrid and Philip IV===
Vel<U+00E1>zquez went to [[Madrid]] in the second half of April 1622, with letters of introduction to [[Don Juan de Fonseca]], himself from Seville, who was chaplain to the King. At the request of Pacheco, Vel<U+00E1>zquez painted the portrait of the famous poet [[Luis de G<U+00F3>ngora y Argote]]. Vel<U+00E1>zquez painted G<U+00F3>ngora crowned with a laurel wreath, but at some unknown later date painted over it. It is possible that Vel<U+00E1>zquez stopped in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] on his way from Seville, on the advice of Pacheco, or back from Madrid on that of G<U+00F3>ngora, a great admirer of [[El Greco]], having composed a poem on the occasion of his death.

In December 1622, Rodrigo de Villandrando, the King's favorite court painter, died. Don Juan de Fonseca conveyed to Vel<U+00E1>zquez the command to come to the Court from the [[Count-Duke of Olivares]], the powerful minister of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]]. He was offered 50 [[ducat]]s (175 g of [[gold]]&mdash;worth about '''[[euro|<U+20AC>]]'''2000 in 2005) to defray his expenses, and he was accompanied by his father-in-law. Fonseca lodged the young painter at his own home and sat for a portrait himself, which, when completed, was conveyed to the Royal palace. A portrait of the King was commissioned. On August 16, 1623, the King sat for Vel<U+00E1>zquez. Complete in one day the portrait was likely to have been no more than a head sketch, but both the King and Olivares were pleased. Olivares commanded Vel<U+00E1>zquez to move his home to Madrid, promising that no other painter would ever paint the King's portrait and all other portraits of the King would be withdrawn from circulation. In the following year, 1624, he received 300 ducats from the king to pay the cost of moving his family to Madrid, which became his home for the remainder of his life.

Through an equestrian portrait of the king, painted in 1623, Vel<U+00E1>zquez secured admission to the royal service with a salary of 20 ducats per month, besides medical attendance, lodgings and payment for the pictures he might paint. The portrait was exhibited on the steps of [[San Felipe]] and was received with enthusiasm. It is now lost. The [[Museo del Prado]], however, has two of Vel<U+00E1>zquez's portraits of the king (nos. 1070 and 1071) in which the severity of the Seville period has disappeared and the tones are more delicate. The modeling is firm, recalling that of [[Antonio Mor]], the Dutch portrait painter of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], who exercised a considerable influence on the Spanish school. In the same year the Prince of Wales (afterwards [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]) arrived at the court of Spain. Records indicate that he sat for Vel<U+00E1>zquez, but the picture is now lost.

[[Image:Philip IV by Velazquez.jpg|thumb|170px|left|A 1628 portrait of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]]]]

In September 1628 [[Peter Paul Rubens]] came to Madrid as an emissary from the Infanta Isabella, and Vel<U+00E1>zquez kept his company among the [[Titian]]s at the [[Escorial]]. Rubens was then at the height of his powers. The seven months of the diplomatic mission showed Rubens' brilliance as painter and courtier. Rubens had a high opinion of Vel<U+00E1>zquez, but he effected no great change in his painting. He reinforced Vel<U+00E1>zquez's desire to see [[Italy]] and the works of the great Italian masters. 

In 1627, Philip set a competition for the best painters of Spain the subject of the expulsion of the [[Moors]]. Vel<U+00E1>zquez won. His picture was destroyed in a fire at the palace in 1734. Recorded descriptions of it say that it depicted [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] pointing with his baton to a crowd of men and women driven off under charge of soldiers, while the female personification of Spain sits in calm repose. Vel<U+00E1>zquez was appointed gentleman usher as reward. Later he also received a daily allowance of 12 [[Real (currency)|real]]s, the same amount allotted to the court barbers, and 90 ducats a year for dress. Five years after he painted it, as an extra payment he received 100 ducats for the picture of [[Bacchus]] (''The Feast of Bacchus''), painted in 1629. The spirit and aim of this work are better understood from its Spanish name, ''Los borrachos'' or ''Los bebedores'' (the tipplers), who are paying mock homage to a half-naked ivy-crowned young man seated on a [[wine]] barrel. The painting is firm and solid, and the light and shade are more deftly handled than in former works. Altogether, this production may be taken as the most advanced example of the first style of Vel<U+00E1>zquez.

==Vel<U+00E1>zquez's Italian period==
It is canonical to divide the artistic career of Vel<U+00E1>zquez by his two visits to Italy, with his second grouping of works following the first visit and his third grouping following the second visit. This somewhat arbitrary division may be accepted though it will not always apply, because, as is usual in the case of many painters, his styles at times overlap each other. Vel<U+00E1>zquez rarely signed his pictures, and the royal archives give the dates of only his most important works. Internal evidence and history pertaining to his portraits supply the rest to a certain extent.

===First visit to Italy===
In 1629 Philip gave Vel<U+00E1>zquez permission to carry out his desire of visiting [[Italy]], without loss of salary, making him a present of 400 ducats to which Olivares added 200. He sailed from [[Barcelona]] in August in the company of the [[Ambrosio Spinola, marqu<U+00E9>s de los Balbases|Marqu<U+00E9>s de Spinola]], the conqueror of [[Breda (Netherlands)|Breda]], then on his way to take command of the Spanish troops at [[Milan]]. It was during this voyage that Vel<U+00E1>zquez must have heard the details of the surrender of Breda from the lips of the victor, and he must have sketched his fine head, known to us also by the portrait by [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyck]].

[[Image:DiegoVelazquez ForgeofVulcan.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''La fragua de Vulcano'' (1630, English: ''The Forge of Vulcan'')]]

In [[Venice]] Vel<U+00E1>zquez made copies of [[Tintoretto]]'s ''Crucifixion'' and ''Last Supper'' which he sent to the king, and in [[Rome]] he copied [[Michelangelo]] and Raphael, lodging in the Villa Medici till fever compelled him to retire into the city. Here he painted the ''La fragua de Vulcano'' (1630, ''The Forge of Vulcan''; no. 1171 of the Museo del Prado), in which [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]] narrates to the astonished [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], the [[blacksmith]] of the gods portrayed here as a village blacksmith, the news of the infidelity of [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]], while four others listen to the scandal. The mythological treatment is similar to that of ''The Drunks'': it is intimately realistic and innately Spanish, giving a picture of the interior of a smithy of Andalusia, with Apollo inserted to make the story tell. The conception is commonplace, yet the impression it produces is from the vividness of the representation and the power of expression. The modeling of the half-naked figures is extremely detailed. Altogether, this picture is much superior to his other work painted at the same time, ''La t<U+00FA>nica de Jos<U+00E9>'' (1630, English: ''Joseph's Bloody Coat''), which now hangs in the [[Escorial]]. Both of these works are evidently painted from the same models. Curiously absent from both of these works, however, is the influence of the Italians.
In Rome Vel<U+00E1>zquez also painted two beautiful landscapes of the gardens of the Villa Medici. Landscape was uncommon in Spanish art, but Vel<U+00E1>zquez showed how capable he was in this branch as well. The silvery views of [[Aranjuez]], which at one time passed under his name, are now considered the work of his pupil and son-in-law Mazo. After a visit to [[Naples]] in 1631, where he worked with his countryman [[Giuseppe Ribera|Jos<U+00E9> Ribera]] and painted a charming portrait of the Infanta Maria, sister of Philip, Vel<U+00E1>zquez returned early in the year to Madrid.

===Return to Madrid (middle period)===
Vel<U+00E1>zquez then painted the first of many portraits of the young prince and heir to the Spanish throne, Don [[Baltasar Carlos]], looking dignified and lordly even in his childhood, in the dress of a field marshal on his prancing steed. The scene is in the [[riding school]] of the palace, the king and queen looking on from a balcony, while Olivares attends as master of the horse to the prince. Don Baltasar died in 1646 at the age of seventeen, so, judging by his age in the portrait, it must have been painted in about 1641. 

[[Image:DiegoVelazquez SurrenderofBreda.jpg|thumb|300px|''La rendici<U+00F3>n de Breda'' (1634-1635, English: ''The Surrender of Breda'') was inspired by Vel<U+00E1>zquez's first visit to Italy, in which he accompanied Ambrosio Sp<U+00ED>nola, who conquered the Dutch city of Breda a few years prior. This masterwork depicts a transfer of the key to the city from the Dutch to the Spanish army during the [[Siege of Breda]].]]

The powerful minister Olivares was the early and constant patron of the painter. His impassive, saturnine face is familiar to us from the many portraits painted by Vel<U+00E1>zquez. Two are notable; one is a full-length, stately and dignified, in which he wears the green cross of [[Alcantara]] and holds a wand, the badge of his office as master of the horse, the other, a great equestrian portrait in which he is flatteringly represented as a field marshal during action. In these portraits, Vel<U+00E1>zquez has well repaid the debt of gratitude that he owed to his first patron, whom Vel<U+00E1>zquez stood by during Olivares's fall from power, thus exposing himself to the great risk of the anger of the jealous Philip. The king, however, showed no sign of malice towards his favorite painter.

The sculptor [[Montafles]] modeled a statue of one of Vel<U+00E1>zquez's equestrian portraits of the king, painted in 1636, which was cast in bronze by the [[Florence|Florentine]] sculptor [[Tacca]] and which now stands in the [[Plaza del Oriente]] at Madrid. The original of this portrait no longer exists, but several others do. Vel<U+00E1>zquez, in this and in all his portraits of the king, depicts Philip wearing the ''golilla'', a stiff linen collar projecting at right angles from the neck. It was invented by the king, who was so proud of it that he celebrated it by a festival followed by a procession to the church to thank God for the blessing. Thus, the ''golilla'' was the height of fashion, and appeared in most of the male portraits of the period.

Vel<U+00E1>zquez was in constant and close attendance on Philip, accompanying him in his journeys to [[Aragon]] in 1642 and 1644, and was doubtless present with him when he entered [[Lerida]] as a conqueror. It was then that he painted a great equestrian portrait in which the king is represented as a great commander leading his troops&mdash;a role which Philip never played except in pageantry. All is full of animation except the stolid face of the king. It hangs as a pendant to the great Olivares portrait&mdash;fit rivals of the neighboring Charles V by [[Titian]], which inspired Vel<U+00E1>zquez to excel himself, and both remarkable for their silvery tone and their feeling of open air.

====Vel<U+00E1>zquez's portraiture====
Besides the forty portraits of Philip by Vel<U+00E1>zquez, he painted portraits of other members of the royal family: Philip's first wife, [[Elisabeth of France|Isabella of Bourbon]], and her children, especially her eldest son, Don Baltasar Carlos, of whom there is a beautiful full-length in a private room at [[Buckingham Palace]]. Cavaliers, soldiers, churchmen and poets of the court, as, for example, the Quevedo at [[Apsley House]], sat to the painter and, even if forgotten by history, will live on his canvas. 

The Spaniards have always been cautious to commit to canvas the portraits of their beautiful women. Queens and infants may be painted and exhibited, but ladies rarely. One wonders who the beautiful woman can be who adorns the Wallace collection, a brunette so unlike the usual fair-haired female sitters to Vel<U+00E1>zquez. This picture is one of the ornaments of the Wallace collection. However, if few ladies of the court of Philip have been depicted, Vel<U+00E1>zquez painted several of his buffoons and dwarfs. Even these deformed or half-witted creatures attract sympathy in the portraits by Vel<U+00E1>zquez, who treats them gently and kindly, as in ''El Primo'' (1644, English: ''The Favorite''), whose intelligent face and huge folio with ink-bottle and pen by his side show him to be a wiser and better-educated man than many of the gallants of the court. ''Pablo de Valladolid'' (1635, English: ''Paul of Valladolid''), a buffoon evidently acting a part, and ''El Bobo de Coria'' (1639, English: ''The Buffoon of Coria'') belong to this middle period.

The greatest of the religious paintings by Vel<U+00E1>zquez also belongs to this middle period, the ''Cristo Crucificado'' (1632, English: ''Christ on the Cross''). It is a work of tremendous originality, depicting Christ immediately after death. The Savior's head hangs on his breast and a mass of dark tangled hair conceals part of the face. The figure stands alone. The picture was lengthened to suit its place in an oratory, but this addition has since been removed.

Vel<U+00E1>zquez's son-in-law Mazo had succeeded him as usher in 1634, and Mazo himself had received a steady promotion in the royal household. Mazo received a pension of 500 ducats in 1640, increased to 700 in 1648, for portraits painted and to be painted, and was appointed inspector of works in the palace in 1647.

[[Image:Pope Innocent X by Velazquez.jpg|thumb|300px|1650 portrait of [[Pope Innocent X]]]]

Philip now entrusted Vel<U+00E1>zquez with carrying out a design on which he had long set his heart: the founding of an [[academy]] of art in Spain. Rich in pictures, Spain was weak in statuary, and Vel<U+00E1>zquez was commissioned once again to proceed to Italy to make purchases.

===Second Visit to Italy===
Accompanied by his slave Pareja, whom he trained in painting, Vel<U+00E1>zquez sailed from [[M<U+00E1>laga]] in 1649, landing at [[Genoa]], and proceeded from Milan to Venice, buying paintings of [[Titian]], [[Tintoretto]] and [[Veronese]] as he went. At [[Modena]] he was received with much favor by the duke, and here he painted the portrait of the duke at the Modena gallery and two portraits that now adorn the [[Dresden]] gallery, for these paintings came from the Modena sale of 1746.

Those works presage the advent of the painter's third and latest manner, a noble example of which is the great portrait of [[Pope Innocent X]] in the [[Doria Pamphilj Gallery]] in Rome, where Vel<U+00E1>zquez now proceeded. There he was received with marked favor by the [[Pope]], who presented him with a medal and golden chain. Vel<U+00E1>zquez took a copy of the portrait&mdash;which Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] thought was the finest picture in Rome&mdash;with him to Spain. Several copies of it exist in different galleries, some of them possibly studies for the original or replicas painted for Philip. Vel<U+00E1>zquez, in this work, had now reached the ''manera abreviada'', a term coined by contemporary Spaniards for this bolder, sharper style. The portrait shows such ruthlessness in Innocent's expression that some in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] feared that Vel<U+00E1>zquez would meet with the Pope's displeasure, but Innocent was well pleased with the work, hanging it in his official visitor's waiting room.

In 1650 in Rome Vel<U+00E1>zquez also painted a portrait of his servant, ''Juan de Pareja'', now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]]. This portrait procured his election into the [[Academy of St. Luke]]. Purportedly Vel<U+00E1>zquez created this portrait as a warm-up of his skills before his portrait of the Pope. It captures in great detail  Pareja's countenance and his somewhat worn and patched clothing with an impressive economy of brushwork; it is one of his best known pieces of portraiture.

==Return to Spain (later period)==
King Philip wished that Vel<U+00E1>zquez return to Spain; accordingly, after a visit to [[Naples]], where he saw his old friend Jos<U+00E9> Ribera,he returned to Spain via [[Barcelona]] in 1651, taking with him many pictures and 300 pieces of statuary, which afterwards were arranged and cataloged for the king. Undraped sculpture was, however, abhorrent to the Spanish Church, and after Philip's death these works gradually disappeared.
[[Isabella of Bourbon]] had died in 1644, and the king had married [[Marie-Anne of Austria]], whom Vel<U+00E1>zquez now painted in many attitudes. He was specially chosen by the king to fill the high office of ''aposentador major'', which imposed on him the duty of looking after the quarters occupied by the court&mdash;a responsible function which was no sinecure and one which interfered with the exercise of his art. Yet far from indicating any decline, his works of this period are amongst the highest examples of his style.

===''[[Las Meninas]]''===

[[Image:Velazquez-Meninas.jpg|left|300px|thumb|''[[Las Meninas]]'', painted in 1656]]

One of the ''[[infanta]]s'', [[Infanta Margarita|Margarita]], the eldest daughter of the new Queen, is the subject of ''Las Meninas'' (1656, English: ''The Maids of Honor''), Vel<U+00E1>zquez's [[magnum opus]]. Created four years before his death, it is a staple of the European [[baroque]] period of art. An apotheosis of the work has been effected since its creation; [[Luca Giordano]], a contemporary Italian painter, referred to it as the "theology of painting," and the [[seventeenth century]] Englishman [[Thomas Lawrence]] cited it as the "philosophy of art," so decidedly capable of producing its desired effect. That effect has been variously interpreted; [[#References|Dale Brown]] points out an interpretation that, in inserting within the work a faded portrait of the king and queen hanging on the back wall, Vel<U+00E1>zquez has ingeniously prognosticated the fall of the [[Spanish empire]] that was to gain momentum following his death. Another interpretation is that the portrait is in fact a mirror, and that the painting itself is in the perspective of the King and Queen, hence their reflection can be seen in the mirror on the back wall.

It is said the king painted the honorary ''[[Cross of Saint James|Cruz Roja]]'' (''Red Cross'') of the ''Orden de Santiago'' (''[[Order of Santiago]]'') on the breast of the painter as it appears today on the canvas. However, Vel<U+00E1>zquez did not receive this honor of [[knighthood]] until three years after execution of this painting. Even the King of Spain could not make his favorite a belted knight without the consent of the commission established to inquire into the [[Limpieza de sangre|purity of his lineage]]. This aim of these inquiries would be to prevent the appointment to positions of anyone found to have even a taint of heresy in their lineage&mdash;that is, a trace of [[Jew]]ish or Moorish blood or contamination by trade or commerce in either side of the family for many generations. The records of this commission have been found among the archives of the ''Order of Santiago''. Vel<U+00E1>zquez was awarded the honor in 1659. His occupation as plebeian and tradesman was justified because, as painter to the king, he was evidently not involved in the practice of "selling" pictures.

In his book ''[[The Order of Things]]'', philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] devotes the entire opening chapter to a detailed analysis of ''Las Meninas''. He describes the ways in which the painting problematizes issues of representation through its use of mirrors, screens, and the subsequent oscillations that occur between the image's interior, surface, and exterior.

===Final years===
Had it not been for this royal appointment, which enabled Vel<U+00E1>zquez to escape the censorship of the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], he would not have been able to release his ''La Venus del espejo'' (1651, English: ''[[The Rokeby Venus|Venus at her Mirror]]'') also known as ''The Rokeby Venus''. It is the only surviving female [[nude]] by Vel<U+00E1>zquez.

[[Image:DiegoVelazquez MeninasDetail.jpg|200px|thumb|Detail of ''[[Las Meninas]]'' (Vel<U+00E1>zquez's self-portrait)]]

There were essentially only two patrons of art in Spain&mdash;the church and the art-loving king and court. [[Bartolome Esteban Murillo]] was the artist favored by the church, while Vel<U+00E1>zquez was patronized by the crown. One difference, however, deserves to be noted. Murillo, who toiled for a rich and powerful church, left little means to pay for his burial, while Vel<U+00E1>zquez lived and died in the enjoyment of good salaries and pensions.

One of his final works was ''Las hilanderas'' (''The Spinners''), painted circa 1657, representing the interior of the royal tapestry works. It is full of light, air and movement, featuring vibrant colors and careful handling. [[Anton Raphael Mengs]] said this work seemed to have been painted not by the hand but by the pure force of will. It displays a concentration of all the art-knowledge Vel<U+00E1>zquez had gathered during his long artistic career of more than forty years. The scheme is simple&mdash;a confluence of varied and blended red, bluish-green, grey and black.

In 1660 a peace treaty between France and Spain was to be consummated by the marriage of [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]] with [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], and the ceremony was to take place in the Island of Pheasants, a small swampy island in the [[Bidassoa]]. Vel<U+00E1>zquez was charged with the decoration of the Spanish pavilion and with the entire scenic display. Vel<U+00E1>zquez attracted much attention from the nobility of his bearing and the splendor of his costume. On [[June 26]] he returned to Madrid, and on the [[July 31]] he was stricken with fever. Feeling his end approaching, he signed his will, appointing as his sole executors his wife and his firm friend named Fuensalida, keeper of the royal records. He died on [[August 6]], 1660. He was buried in the Fuensalida vault of the church of [[Saint John the Baptist|San Juan Bautista]], and within eight days his wife Juana was buried beside him. Unfortunately this church was destroyed by the French in 1811, so his place of interment is now unknown. There was much difficulty in adjusting the tangled accounts outstanding between Vel<U+00E1>zquez and the treasury, and it was not until 1666, after the death of King Philip, that they were finally settled.

==Vel<U+00E1>zquez in modernity==

[[Image:PabloPicasso Meninas.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Picasso's 1957 recreation of ''Las Meninas'']]

Until the nineteenth century, little was known outside of Spain of Vel<U+00E1>zquez's work. His paintings mostly escaped being stolen by the [[France|French]] marshals during the [[Peninsular War]]. In 1828 Sir [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] wrote from Madrid that he felt himself in the presence of a new power in art as he looked at the works of Vel<U+00E1>zquez, and at the same time found a wonderful affinity between this artist and the English school of portrait painters, especially [[Henry Raeburn]]. He was struck by the modern impression pervading Vel<U+00E1>zquez's work in both landscape and portraiture.

Presently, his technique and individuality have earned Vel<U+00E1>zquez a prominent position in the annals of European art, and he is often considered a father of the Spanish school of art. Although acquainted with all the Italian schools and a friend of the foremost painters of his day, he was strong enough to withstand external influences and work out for himself the development of his own nature and his own principles of art.

Vel<U+00E1>zquez is often cited as a key influence on the art of [[<U+00C9>douard Manet]], important when considering that Manet is often cited as the bridge between realism and [[Impressionism]]. Calling Vel<U+00E1>zquez the "painter of painters," Manet admired Vel<U+00E1>zquez's use of vivid brushwork in the midst of the baroque academic style of his contemporaries and built upon Vel<U+00E1>zquez's motifs in his own art.
[[Image:RicardoPecharrom<U+00E1>n SurrenderofBreda.JPG|250px|thumb|One of Pecharrom<U+00E1>n's 1999 recreations of ''La rendici<U+00F3>n de Breda'']]
===Modern recreations of Vel<U+00E1>zquez's classics===
[[Image:FrancisBacon FigurewithMeat.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[Figure with Meat]]'' (1954)]]
The importance of Vel<U+00E1>zquez's art even today is evident in considering the respect with which [[twentieth century]] painters regard his work. [[Pablo Picasso]] presented the most durable homage to Vel<U+00E1>zquez in 1957 when he recreated ''Las Meninas'' in his characteristically [[cubism|cubist]] form. While Picasso was worried that if he copied Vel<U+00E1>zquez's painting, it would be seen only as a copy and not as any sort of unique representation, he proceeded to do so, and the enormous work&mdash;the largest he had produced since ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' in 1937&mdash;earned a position of relevance in the Spanish canon of art. Picasso retained the general form and positioning of the original in the framework of his [[avant-garde]] cubist style.

[[Salvador Dal<U+00ED>]], as with Picasso in anticipation of the tercentennial of Vel<U+00E1>zquez's death, created in 1958 a work entitled '' Vel<U+00E1>zquez Painting the Infanta Margarita''. The color scheme shows Dal<U+00ED>'s serious tribute to Vel<U+00E1>zquez; the work also functioned, as in Picasso case, as a vehicle for the presentation of newer theories in art and thought&mdash;[[nuclear mysticism]], in Dal<U+00ED>'s case.

The Anglo-Irish painter [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] found Vel<U+00E1>zquez's portrait of Pope Innocent X to be one of the greatest portraits ever made. He created several [[expressionism|expressionist]] variations of this piece in the 1950s; however, Bacon's paintings presented a more gruesome image of the pope, who had now been dead for centuries. One such famous variation, entitled ''[[Figure with Meat]]'' (1954), shows the pope between two halves of a bisected cow.

[[Ricardo Pecharrom<U+00E1>n]] celebrated the quadricentennial of Vel<U+00E1>zquez's birth in 1999 by recreating a number of Vel<U+00E1>zquez's works in a [[postmodernism|postmodern]] style.
