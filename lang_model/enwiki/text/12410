'''John Hodgins''' (born [[1961]] in [[Cork]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]) is a retired [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] sportsman. He played [[hurling]] with his local club [[St. Finbarr's GAA|St. Finbarr's]] and with the [[Cork GAA|Cork]] senior inter-county team from 1984 until 1986.

==Playing career==
===Club===

Hodgins played gis club [[hurling]] with the famous [[St. Finbarr's GAA|St. Finbarr's]] club in Cork.  He enjoyed much success in the 1980s, winning senior [[Cork Senior Hurling Championship|county titles]] in [[1980]], [[1981]], [[1982]], [[1984]], [[1988]] and [[1993]].

===Inter-county===

Hodgins first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the [[Cork GAA|Cork]] minor hurling team in the late 1970s.  He missed out on a Munster medal in this grade in [[1978]], however, he did win an [[All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship|All-Ireland]] following a victory over [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]].  In [[1979]] Hodgins won a [[Munster Minor Hurling Championship|Munster]] title with the Cork minor hurlers before collecting a second All-Ireland medal following another win over Kilkenny in the championship decider.  Hodgins subsequently joined the Cork under-21 hurling team.  He won a [[Munster Under-21 Hurling Championship|Munster]] title in this grade in [[1982]] before laer winning an [[All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship|All-Ireland]] medal following a victory over [[Galway GAA|Galway]] in the final.

Two years after this Hodgins was a regular on the Cork senior hurling team.  That year he won his first senior [[Munster Senior Hurling Championship|Munster]] title following a victory over [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] in a thrilling provincial decider.  Cork later lined out against [[Offaly GAA|Offaly]] in the centenary All-Ireland final at [[Semple Stadium]].  In the one hundred years of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] it was the first ever meeting of these two sides.  Cork were much too powerful for Offaly on the occasion and won the game on a score line of 3-16 to 1-12, giving Hodgins a coveted senior [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|All-Ireland]] medal.  In [[1985]] Hodgins won a second senior Munster title.  Cork, however, were later defeated by Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final.  In [[1986]] Cork retained their provincial crown for a fifth consecutive year.  It was Hodgins third Munster medal.  Hodgins was later dropped from the team for the All-Ireland final, which Cork won against Galway.  His involvement with the Cork senior hurling team ended shortly after this.
