'''''Equus''''' is a [[genus]] of mammals in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Equidae]], which includes [[horse]]s, [[donkey|asses]], and [[zebra]]s. Within Equidae, ''Equus'' is the only [[Extant taxon|extant]] genus. The term '''equine''' refers to any member of this genus, including horses. Like Equidae more broadly, ''Equus'' has numerous [[extinct]] [[species]] known only from [[fossil]]s. The genus likely originated in North America and spread quickly to the Old World. There are seven living species. Equines are [[odd-toed ungulate]]s with slender legs, long heads, relatively long necks, manes (erect in most subspecies) and long tails. All species are [[herbivorous]], and mostly [[grazing|grazers]] with simpler digestive systems than [[Ruminantia|ruminants]] but are able to subsist on lower quality vegetation.

While the domestic horse and donkey (along with their [[feral horse|feral]] descendants) exist worldwide, wild equine populations are limited to Africa and Asia. Wild equine social systems come in two forms; a [[Harem (zoology)|harem]] system with tight-kit groups consisting one adult male or [[stallion]], two to several females or [[mare]]s and their young or [[foal]]s; and a territorial system where males establish territories with resources that attract females, which associate very fluidly. In both systems, females take care of their offspring but males may play a role as well. Equines communicate with each other both visually and vocally. Human activities have threatened wild equine populations and out of the seven living species, only the [[plains zebra]] remains widespread and abundant.

==Etymology==
The word ''equus'' is [[Latin]] for "horse",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dequus equus], Charlton T.

{{further|Evolution of the horse}}
The genus ''Equus'' was first [[Species description|described]] by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758. It is the only recognized [[Extant taxon|extant]] genus in the family [[Equidae]].<ref name="MacDonald"/> The first equids were small, dog-sized mammals (e. g. ''[[Eohippus]]'') adapted for browsing on shrubs during the [[Eocene]], around 54 million years ago (mya). These animals had three toes on the hind feet and four on the front feet with small hooves in place of claws but also had [[Paw|soft pads]].<ref name="doi10.1126/science.1105458">{{Cite doi|10.1126/science.1105458 }}</ref> Equids developed into larger, three-toed animals (e. g.

The genus ''Equus'', which includes all extant equines, is believed to have evolved from ''[[Dinohippus]]'', via the intermediate form ''[[Plesippus]]''. One of the oldest species is ''[[Hagerman Horse|Equus simplicidens]]'', described as zebra-like with a donkey-shaped head. The oldest material to date was found in Idaho, USA. The genus appears to have spread quickly into the Old World, with the similarly aged ''E. livenzovensis'' documented from western Europe and Russia.<ref name=Azzaroli>{{cite journal |last=Azzaroli |first=A. |year=1992 |title=Ascent and decline of monodactyl equids: a case for prehistoric overkill |journal=Ann.

===Ecology and daily activates===
[[File:IndianWildAss.jpg|thumb|right|Group of onagers grazing]]
Extant wild equines have scattered ranges across Africa and Asia. The Plains zebra lives in lush grasslands and savannas of Eastern and Southern Africa, while the Mountain zebra inhabits mountainous areas of southwest Africa. The other equine species tend to occupy more arid environments with more scattered vegetation. The Gr<U+00E9>vy's zebra is found in thorny scrubland of East Africa, while the African wild ass inhabits rocky deserts of North Africa. The two Asian wild ass species live in the dry deserts of the Near East and Central Asia while the Przwelski's wild horse's habitat is the deserts of Mongolia. Only the range of the Plains and Gr<U+00E9>vy's zebras overlap.<ref name="MacDonald"/> In addition to wild populations, domesticated horses and donkeys are widespread thanks to humans. In certain parts of the world, populations of [[feral horse]]s and feral donkeys exist, which are descended from domesticated animals released into the wild.<ref name="BLM Facts">{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=Wild Horse and Burro Myths and Facts|url=http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/whbprogram/history_and_facts/myths_and_facts.html |publisher=Bureau of Land Management |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Dawson, Michelle|date=August 2009|title=Aerial survey of feral horses in the Australian Alps|publisher=Australian Alps National Parks|url=http://theaustralianalps.wordpress.com/the-alps-partnership/publications-and-research/aerial-survey-of-feral-horses-in-the-australian-alps/|accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref>

Equines are [[monogastric]] [[hindgut fermentation|hindgut fermenters]].<ref name=Waikato>{{cite web|title=Animal Structure & Function|url=http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/farm/content/animalstructure.html#Hindgut_fermenters|website=Science on the Farm|publisher=University of Waikato|accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref>  They prefer to eat grasses and sedges, but may also consume bark, leaves, buds, fruits and roots if their favored foods are scarce, particularly asses. Compared to [[Ruminantia|ruminants]], equines have a simpler and less efficient digestive system. Nevertheless, they can subsist on lower quality vegetation. After food is passed though the stomach, it enters the sac-like [[cecum]]. where cellulose is broken down by micro-organisms. Fermentation is quicker in equines than in ruminants; 30<U+2013>45 hours for a horse compared to 70<U+2013>100 hours for a cow. Equines may spend 60-80 percent of their time feeding, depending on the availability and quality of vegetation.<ref name="MacDonald"/><ref name="Estes 1991"/> In the African savannas, the plains zebra is a pioneer grazer; moving down the upper, less nutritious grass canopy and preparing the way for more specialized grazers like [[blue wildebeest]]s and [[Thomson's gazelle]]s which depend on shorter and more nutritious grasses below.<ref>{{cite book|author=Pastor, J.; Cohen, Y.;Hobbs, T.|year=2006|contribution=The roles of large herbivores in ecosystem nutrient cycles|editor=Danell, K.|title= Large Herbivore Ecology, Ecosystem Dynamics and Conservation|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=295|isbn=978-0-521-53687-5}}</ref>

Wild equines may spend seven hours a day sleeping. During the day, they sleep standing up while at night they lie down. They regularly  rub against trees, rocks and other objects and roll in around in dust for protection against flies and irritation. With the exception of the mountain zebra, wild equines can roll completely over.<ref name="Estes 1991"/>

===Social behavior===
[[File:Zebra Botswana edit02.jpg|thumb|Plains zebra group]]
Equines are social animals with two basic social structures. Horses, plains zebras and mountain zebras live in stable, closed family groups or [[Harem (zoology)|harem]]s consisting of one adult male, several females and their offspring. These groups have their own [[home range]]s which overlap and they tend to be nomadic. The stability of the group remains even when the family stallion dies or is displaced. Plains zebra groups gather into large herds and may create temporarily stable subgroups within a herd, allowing individuals to interact with those outside their group. Among harem-holding species, this has only been observed in primates like the [[gelada]] and the [[hamadryas baboon]]. Females of harem species benefit as males give them more time for feeding, protection of young, as well as protection from predators and harassment from outside males. Among females in a harem, a linear [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance hierarchy]] exists based on the time in which they join the group. Harems travel in a consistent filing order with the high-ranking mares and their offspring leading the groups followed by the next high-ranking mare and her offspring and so on. The family stallion takes up the rear. [[Social grooming]] (which involves individuals rubbing their heads against each other and nipping with the incisors and lips) is important for easing aggression and maintaining social bonds and social status. Young of both sexes leave their natal groups as they mature; females are usually abducted by outside males to be included as permanent members of their harems.<ref name="MacDonald"/><ref name="Estes 1991"/><ref name="Rubenstein 1986"/>

In Gr<U+00E9>vy's zebras and the wild ass species, adults have more fluid associations and adult males will establish large [[Territory (animal)|territories]] and monopolize the females that enter them. These species live in habitats with sparser resources and standing water and grazing areas may be separated. Groups of lactating females are able to remain in groups with non-lactating ones and usually gather at foraging areas. Among territorial males, the most dominant males establish territories near watering holes, where more sexually receptive females gather. Subdominants have territories farther away, near forage areas. Mares may wander through several territories but remain in one when they have young. Staying in a territory offers a female protection from harassment by outside males, as well as access to a renewable resource. Some feral populations of horse exhibit features of both the harem and territorial social systems.<ref name="MacDonald"/><ref name="Estes 1991"/><ref name="Rubenstein 1986"/>

In both equine social systems, excess males gather into bachelor groups. These are typically young males who are not yet ready to establish a harem or territory. With the plains zebra, the males in a bachelor group have strong bonds and have a linear dominance hierarchy. Fights between males usually occur over estrus females and involve biting and kicking.<ref name="MacDonald"/><ref name="Estes 1991"/><ref name="Rubenstein 1986">{{cite book|author=Rubenstein, D. I.|year=1986|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~dir/pdf_dir/1986_Rubenstein_bookChapt.pdf|contribution=Ecology and sociality in horses and zebras|pages=282<U+2013>302|title=Ecological Aspects of Social Evolution|editor=D.

===Communication===
[[File:France Loz<U+00E8>re Causse M<U+00E9>jean Chevaux de Przewalski 20.jpg|thumb|right|Przewalski's horses interacting]]
When meeting for the first time or after they have separated, individuals may greet each other by rubbing and sniffing their noses followed by rubbing their cheeks, moving their noses along their bodies and sniffing each other's genitals. They then may rub and press their shoulders against each other and rest their heads on one another. This greeting is usually preformed among harem or territorial males or among bachelor males playing.<ref name="Estes 1991"/>

Equines produce a number of vocalizations and acoustics. Loud snorting is associated with alarm. Squealing is usually made when in pain, but bachelors will squeal while play fighting. The contact calls of equines vary from the whinnying and nickering of the horse, the barking of plains zebras, and the braying of asses and Gr<U+00E9>vy's zebras. Equines also communicate with visual displays and the flexibility of their lips allows them to make complex facial expressions. Visual displays also incorporate the positions of the head, ears and tail. An equine may signal an intention to kick by laying back its ears and sometimes lashing the tail. Flattened ears, bared teeth and abrupt movement of the heads may be used as threatening gestures, particularly among stallions.<ref name="Estes 1991"/>

===Reproduction and parenting===
[[File:Grevy Zebra.jpg|thumb|right|Gr<U+00E9>vy's zebra foal]]
Among harem-holding species, the adult females mate only with their harem stallion, while in other species, such as the zebras, mating is more [[promiscuous]] and the males have larger testes for [[sperm competition]].<ref name="Ginsberg 1990">{{cite journal|author=Ginsberg, R., D. I. Rubenstein|year=1990|title= Sperm competition and variation in zebra mating behavior|journal= Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume= 26|issue= 6|pages= 427<U+2013>34|doi= 10.1007/BF00170901|url= http://www.princeton.edu/~dir/pdf_dir/1990_Ginsberg&dir_BehEcolSo.pdf}}</ref> [[Estrous cycle|Estrous]] in female equines lasts 5<U+2013>10 days; physical signs include frequent urination, flowing muscus, and a swollen, everted labia. In addition, estrous females will stand with their hind legs spread and raise their tails when in the presence of a male. Males assess the female's reproductive state with the [[flehmen response]] and the female will solicit mating by backing in. Length of gestation varies by species, roughly 11 to 13 months, and most mares will come into estrus again within a few days after foaling, depending on conditions.<ref name="Estes 1991"/> Usually only a single foal is born and it is capable of running in an hour. Within few weeks, foals will attempt to graze, but may continue to nurse for 8<U+2013>13 months.<ref name="MacDonald"/> Arid-living species like the Gr<U+00E9>vy's zebra have longer nursing intervals and wait until they are 3 months of age before they start drinking water.<ref name="Becker 1990">{{cite journal |last1=Becker |first1=C. D. |first2=J.

Among harem-holding species, foals are cared for mostly by their mothers. However, when threatened by predators, the entire group works together to protect all the young. The group forms a protective front with the foals in the center and the stallion will rush at predators that come too close.<ref name="Estes 1991"/> In territory-holding species, mothers may gather into small groups and leave their young in "[[Cr<U+00E8>che (zoology)|kindergartens]]" under the guard of a territorial male while searching for water.<ref name="Becker 1990"/>  Gr<U+00E9>vy's zebra stallions may look after a foal in his territory to ensure the mother stays, even though it may not be his.<ref name="Rubenstein 1986"/>

The Przewalski's horse has been conclusively shown not to be an ancestor of the domestic horse, even though the two can hybridze and produce fertile offspring. The split between Przewalskii's horse and ''E. ferus caballus'' is estimated to have occurred 120,000<U+2013> 240,000 years ago, long before domestication. Of the caballine equines, ''E. ferus,'' it is ''E. ferus ferus,'' also known as the European wild horse or "tarpan" that shares ancestry with the modern domestic horse.<ref name=Kefena>{{cite journal|author=Kefena, E.

Archaeological, biogeographical, and linguistic evidence suggest that the donkey was first domesticated by nomadic pastoral people in North Africa over 5,000 years ago. The animals were used to help cope with the increased aridity of the Sahara and the [[Horn of Africa|Horn]].

Humans have had a great impact on the populations of wild equines. Threats to wild equines include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people and livestock. Since the 20th century, wild equines have been decimated from much of their former ranges and their populations scattered and two subspecies, the quagga and the tarpan, became extinct. Only the plains zebra remains numerous and widespread.<ref name="MacDonald"/> The [[IUCN]] lists the African wild ass as [[Critically Endangered]], the Gr<U+00E9>vy's zebra, mountain zebra and Przewalski's horse as [[Endangered]], the Onager as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], the kiang as [[Lower Risk]] and the plains zebra as [[Least Concern]].<ref name=IUCN>{{IUCN2011.2|assessors=Boyd, L. & King, S.
