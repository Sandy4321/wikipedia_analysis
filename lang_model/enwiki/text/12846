==Background==

==Politics==
In [[Toronto municipal election, 2003|2003]], Grimes ran as a municipal councillor in Ward 6 Etobicoke-Lakeshore to replace [[Irene Jones]] who left the seat to run in the provincial election. He was one of nine candidates to run for the seat. During the campaign he and his closest rival Berardo Mascioli, accused each other of dirty tricks during the election campaign. Both camps complained that the other one was removing or vandalizing election signs. On election night phone lines to both campaign offices were cut. Grimes won the election by 1,352 votes.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Grimes replaces Jones in Ward 6 |last = Tamara | first = Shephard | publisher = Etobicoke Guardian | date = 2003-12-03}}</ref>

In 2005, Grimes was appointed to the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] board but he resigned in 2006 due to a conflict with board chair [[Howard Moscoe]]. Grimes seconded a motion of non-confidence in Moscoe over his handling of negotiations with the TTC union. When the vote lost, Grimes immediately resigned. He said continuing to serve on the board would be a waste of time. he said, "Obviously my voice isn't going to be heard."<ref>{{Cite news |title=TTC keeps Moscoe, Grimes resigns |last = Cowan | first = James | publisher =National Post | page = A15 | date = 2006-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Moscoe keeps job with TTC, Grimes steps down |last = Nickle | first = David | publisher =Etobicoke Guardian | page = 1 | date = 2006-07-20}}</ref>  

While Grimes was generally opposed to initiatives supported by Mayor David Miller, he became a key player in getting the land transfer tax passed in 2007. Grimes proposed a compromise that would see rebates for first time buyers. He said, "I'm not there for the mayor or to play the left wing against the right wing... Nobody likes new taxes, but I don't want to see libraries and ice rinks and community centres closing."<ref>{{Cite news |title=Compromise could tip tax vote; Councillor Mark Grimes suggests modifications to unite warring sides as new taxes go to council; mayor's allies grow optimistic proposal can pass |last = Byers | first = Jim | publisher =Toronto Star | page = A8 | date = 2007-10-18}}</ref>

After the 2010 election he was named chair of the Etobicoke-York Community Council.<ref name="citybio"/>
