Two years later, senior Jordan and teammate Rex Walters helped lead the Jayhawks to further success when they captured the 1993 [[Big Eight Conference|Big Eight]] Regular Season Championship and the second seed in the Midwest Region of the [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] with a 25-6 record.

Though Kansas eventually finished at 29-7 with a loss to [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] in the Final Four, the team's outstanding performance that year earned the squad a top ten nationwide ranking during the regular season, including a brief time spent at number one.<ref>{{cite news | last = Sung | first = Elaine | title = No Oz, Kansas at Home in Final Four | page = | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 1993-04-02 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-939943.html?refid=gg_x_02 | accessdate = 2009-04-21 }}</ref>  Jordan's legacy with Kansas is also recognized in holding the Jayhawks' number six spot for most assists in the school's history<ref name="Jordan Commits" /> and is 22nd on the school's all-time scoring list.<ref name="Jordan Commits" />

==Professional career==
Jordan was drafted by the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in the [[1993 NBA Draft]] after a storied basketball career at Kansas.
