'''Kaja Bordevich Ballo''' (1988 <U+2013> March 28, 2008) was a [[university student]] in the [[France|French]] town of Nice; her father was [[Olav Gunnar Ballo]], a member of the [[Stortinget|Norwegian Parliament]]. On March 28, 2008 Kaja Ballo took the [[Oxford Capacity Analysis|personality test]] run by the [[Church of Scientology]], and subsequently committed [[suicide]]. Family and friends stated that Ballo was happy prior to taking the test, and that her mood dramatically shifted after receiving the results. She committed suicide hours after getting the results of the test back; Ballo jumped from the fourth floor of her dorm room. In addition to a note, her family found the Scientology personality test among her belongings. [[French police]] investigated connections between Scientology and Ballo's death, and interviewed two leaders of the organization in France. Prosecutors stated in December 2008 that they were unable to establish a causative link between the Scientology test and Ballo's death.

A Scientology representative in France asserted that the Scientology personality test was not created by the Church of Scientology, and that it was not related to Ballo's death. The Church of Scientology's information chief in Norway, Matthias Fosse stated that the test was not dangerous and that the organization did not bear any responsibility for Ballo's death. Ballo's father retained a lawyer to investigate his daughter's death, and the family considered filing a lawsuit against Scientology. 500 people attended Ballo's funeral on April 11, 2008 at Grefsen Church in [[Oslo]], Norway.

The incident received significant media coverage in Norway, and  ''[[Verdens Gang]]'' and ''[[Dagbladet]]'' devoted multiple [[cover story|cover stories]] to investigating the controversy. The media faced criticism for its extensive coverage of Ballo's death.<ref name="kritikk"/> Norway parliament member [[Inga Marte Thorkildsen]] commented that she thought indications were that Scientology had a role in Ballo's suicide. [[Psychologist]] Rudy Myrvang told ''[[Aftenposten]]'' that the Scientology personality test was designed to break down an individual; he characterized the test as a form of recruitment tool for the organization. Scientology critic [[Andreas Heldal-Lund]] stated parents of those involved in Scientology contacted him with similar concerns. The Norwegian Psychological Association warned individuals against taking such types of personality tests.

Ballo's father wrote a book about his daughter's death, and refrained from interviews with the press until the book was published in 2009. Titled '''''Kaja: 1988<U+2013>2008''''', the book became a [[bestseller]] in Norway. It reached second place on the bestseller list of the Bestseller Association in Norway for general literature, in May 2009. The author stated he wrote the book as an expository method to both process his grief, inform his family about the controversy, and educate the public about suicide.
