==Plot==
{{further|[[The Prince of Tennis]]}}

Twelve year old [[Ryoma Echizen]] is the tennis prodigy from America who has the personal history of winning 4 successive victories at the American Junior Tennis tournaments. His father, Nanjiroh Echizen, a tennis player of legendary status, recalls Ryoma back to Japan to attend the distinguished school of Seishun Academy Middle School. Ryoma, a first year, has his eyes set on being on the regulars team of the tennis club, which the school is famous for. 

The members of the Seigaku regulars team include [[Kunimitsu Tezuka]], the captain of the tennis club, whose ranking is that on the National's level. The vice-captain, [[Shuichiro Oishi]], who has a calm and rational sense of playing sense, compliments the acrobatic plays of his double's partner, [[Eiji Kikumaru]]; making them the Golden Pair. Third year, [[Shusuke Fuji]], a formidable player, is known for his tactical skill on the tennis courts. Then there's [[Sadaharu Inui]], whose tennis style relies on what he calls, "data tennis" and [[Takashi Kawamura]] whose personality instantly changes when he grabs his tennis racket. While second years [[Takeshi Momoshiro]], known for his power plays and [[Kaoru Kaidoh]], whose perseverance is daunting, round off the Seigaku regulars team. 

Ryoma arrives in time for the monthly campus ranking tournament, but at first, due to his young age and his cool attitude, some club members do not take him seriously; however, during the ranking tournament, Ryoma is quick to prove his skill and become the only first year on the regulars team, just in time for the regional preliminary rounds. 

Then, there's the lone girl who watches Ryoma from the audience. Her name is Shioin Higaki, whose parents had died in accident. She is mute due to traumatic shock of her past. She first meets Ryoma when he helps her on the train from loud group of High School boys. 

While in a crucial match against Fudomine Middle School during the regionals, Ryoma injures his eye by accident, but his determination to finish the match helps bring victory to Seigaku as they can advance to the Kanto conference as regional champions.

==Alterations from the Anime/Manga==
The movie is a condensed version of the manga and anime series, thus a lot of the events that happen are condensed and characters were changed.
*For instance, the character of [[Sumire Ryuzaki]]'s age was changed so that instead of being a grandmother (and Nanjiroh's junior middle school coach), she became a year younger than Nanjiroh and became a former junior middle school student with him.
*In the movie, the character of Wakashi Hiyoshi from the Hyotei school was replaced by Egate Mcleod Higaki, whereas in the manga/anime, there was no Egate Mcleod Higaki, he was created as an original character for the movie.
*Similarly, Egate Mcleod Higaki's sister, Shioin Higaki, is also an original character that was not in the manga/anime series. Her purpose in the movie is to pretty much serve as the anime/manga character, [[Sakuno Ryuzaki]].
*In the movie, the Oishi/Kikumaru pair takes on the Oshitari/Mukahi pair, while originally it was the Momoshiro/Kikumaru pair who did so. Additionally, they lose and the Inui/Kaidoh pair win for Seigaku, while in the manga the opposite happened.
*The entire prefectural tournament, along with the matches against St. Rudolph and Yamabuki, are skipped over.
*In the anime, Echizen faces against senpais Arai and Momoshiro prior to becoming a regular.  In the movie, Kaido is the first to challenge Echizen.  Because of this change, when Echizen plays in the ranking matches, he faces against Momoshiro and Inui. In the anime, he did have a match with Inui, but the first match was with Kaido.
*In the ranking match, Momoshiro has already developed the Jack Knife.

== Trivia ==
*Only the 2nd [[Seigaku]] cast from [[The Prince of Tennis Musicals]] kept their respective roles for this movie, with the exception of [[Kotarou Yanagi]], who played Ryoma in the musicals.
*As well, [[Koji Date]] was the only [[The Prince of Tennis Musicals]] actor from the 2nd Hyotei cast to reprise his role as Choutarou Ohtori. 
*Everyone else was completely recast.
*The role of [[Ryoma Echizen]] was recasted so that instead of having [[Kotarou Yanagi]] reprise his role from the musicals for the movie, [[Kanata Hongo]] was cast to better portray Ryoma as Hongo, 15, was closer to the age of Ryoma (12) while Yanagi, 20 was much older. Furthermore, as Yanagi had been injured in a car accident, he was unable to perform the physical tennis plays that was required of the character.
*Cameos of graduated [[Tenimyu]] actors appear in the movie.
*Schools that appear in the movie besides Seigaku and Hyotei: Fudomine, Rokkaku, Higa-Chuu, Rikkaidai and Shitenhouji.
*[[Yasuka Saitou]], who played Shinji Ibu, also played Takashi in ''[[Mirrorman REFLEX]]'' and portrayed Masumi Inou/BoukenBlack in ''[[GoGo Sentai Boukenger]]''.  Also [[Ryuuji Sainei]], who plays Keigo Atobe, portrayed Ban/DekaRed in ''[[Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger]]''
*Hiroki Suzuki, who played [[Shuichiro Oishi]], currently portrays Jan Kando in ''[[Juken Sentai Gekiranger]]''
