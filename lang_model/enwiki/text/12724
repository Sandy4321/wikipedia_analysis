'''The Dragon's Call''' is the first episode of the first series of the British fantasy-adventure family television series ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]''. Written by Julian Jones and directed by [[James Hawes]], the episode was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 20 September 2008.

The episode tells the arrival of [[Merlin (Merlin character)|Merlin]] ([[Colin Morgan]]) as a young man in [[Camelot]], where magic is banned by King [[Uther Pendragon (Merlin character)|Uther Pendragon]] ([[Anthony Head]]). Taken under the wing of Camelot's physician, Gaius ([[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]]), he is warned that he must keep his innate magical ability a secret. In Camelot, he meets Uther's heir, the arrogant Prince [[List of Merlin characters#King Arthur Pendragon|Arthur]] ([[Bradley James]]), as well as Lady [[Morgana (Merlin character)|Morgana]] ([[Katie McGrath]]) and her handmaid, [[List of Merlin characters#Queen Guinevere "Gwen" Pendragon|Guinevere]] ([[Angel Coulby]]). As a witch ([[Eve Myles]]) plans revenge on the King's heir for the execution of her son, Merlin is informed by a cryptic [[The Great Dragon (Merlin)|dragon]] ([[John Hurt]]) that his destiny is to protect Arthur.

''Merlin'' was conceived by Julian Murphy and Johnny Capps to be an origin story for the characters of the Arthurian legends, with family-centered entertainment. Young actors with little experience were cast as the four lead characters, while better-known actors were cast in supporting roles. Many of the scenes in Camelot were filmed in France, at the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Pierrefonds]], while the rest was filmed in England and Wales. Special effects were done by [[The Mill (post-production)|The Mill]], who had the task of creating the talking dragon. "The Dragon's Call" was watched by 7.15 million viewers in the UK and 6.3 million in the US on [[NBC]]. Critical reception was mixed, with some feeling the show had promise but lacked imagination, and the actual plot of "The Dragon's Call" was deemed slight.

==Plot==
Young [[Merlin (Merlin character)|Merlin]] ([[Colin Morgan]]) arrives in [[Camelot]] and witnesses the execution of accused sorcerer Thomas Collins by the order of King [[Uther Pendragon (Merlin character)|Uther Pendragon]] ([[Anthony Head]]), who has banned the practice of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] in his kingdom. Thomas' mother Mary ([[Eve Myles]]) swears to kill Uther's son as revenge, before vanishing to avoid arrest. The King's ward, [[Morgana (Merlin character)|Morgana]] ([[Katie McGrath]]), warns that Uther may be making enemies.

Merlin reports to Camelot's physician Gaius ([[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]]) and saves the old man's life when he falls from a balcony by magically moving a mattress to cushion his fall. Though initially denying his abilities, Merlin later admits that he has had magical powers since birth, which Gaius warns him about. Reading a letter from Merlin's mother, Gaius realises that the boy was sent to Camelot for protection. Meanwhile, Mary kills Lady Helen (Myles), a singer who is to perform at Uther's court, with a [[poppet]]. Mary assumes Helen's appearance using an enchantment, though her true appearance can still be seen in mirrors.

Outside, Merlin stands up for a servant who is being bullied by his master, but as the master turns out to be the King's son, [[List of Merlin characters#King Arthur Pendragon|Arthur]] ([[Bradley James]]), Merlin is imprisoned. For the second night in a row, he hears a voice calling his name. Gaius frees him the next morning, though Merlin has to spend time in the [[stocks]]. There he meets Morgana's handmaiden [[List of Merlin characters#Queen Guinevere "Gwen" Pendragon|Guinevere]] or "Gwen" ([[Angel Coulby]]), who commends him for being brave. Merlin confronts Arthur after being released, who tricks him into a fight with [[Mace (club)|mace]]s. Merlin keeps Arthur away using magic, which is met with ridicule by Gaius. Hearing the same voice calling his name that night, Merlin follows it to a cave where a dragon ([[John Hurt]]) informs him that he is destined to protect Arthur with his powers.

Gaius instructs Merlin to deliver elixirs to Morgana and Lady Helen; in the latter's room he finds the poppet, but bluffs his way out of discovery. Later, Helen kills a handmaiden who glimpses her true form in a mirror. At the feast, Mary sings an enchantment as Lady Helen, causing all the guests to fall asleep. Merlin, realising what is going on, covers his ears. Mary attempts to kill Arthur, but Merlin drops a chandelier on her with magic before she releases the dagger. As she has stopped singing, the enchantment is lifted. In a last effort she throws the dagger at Arthur, but Merlin slows time to pull him out of the way. Uther rewards Merlin by making him Arthur's servant, though neither boy is thrilled with the idea. The next day, Gaius gives Merlin a book on magic, under condition that he keep it hidden.

==Production==

===Conception and development===
''Merlin'' was conceived by [[Shine Limited|Shine Television]] producers Julian Murphy and Johnny Capps, who had worked together on ''[[Hex (TV series)|Hex]]'', a fantasy series produced by Shine for [[Sky One]].<ref name="cues up ads">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/aug/29/bbc.television|title=Merlin: BBC cues up TV and cinema ads|first=Mark|last=Sweeney|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=29 August 2008|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> The two had enjoyed presenting a "high-concept" show, and wished to do more.<ref name="times article">{{cite web|first=Garry|last=Jenkins|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article4779531.ece|title=The BBC turns from Doctor Who to Merlin as knights draw in|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110615123644/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article4779531.ece|archivedate=15 June 2011|work=[[The Times]]|date=20 September 2008|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> The [[BBC]] had been interested in broadcasting a drama based on the character of Merlin for some time; a little over a year before the Shine series was initiated, writer and producer [[Chris Chibnall]] had been developing a project aimed at a BBC One Sunday night slot, which was ultimately not commissioned.<ref name="magic touch">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/dec/07/broadcasting.bbc|title=BBC1 seeks magic touch for Merlin drama|first=Jason|last=Deans|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=7 December 2006|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> The programme was intended for family entertainment and designed to appeal to a wide audience.<ref name="magic touch"/><ref name="bbcjuly"/>

As the Arthurian legends do not reflect genuine historical events, not being set in any one singular period in time, the show's creators were more interested in conveying a world that felt "real".<ref name="behind the magic"/> Not constrained by  historical accuracy, they had many opportunities to build the world in which they set their series; for example, tomatoes were included despite being absent from Europe in the Medieval era, and there was never a dragon in the earliest texts involving Merlin.<ref name="commentary"/> The series was intended to have an "epic scale" that would have a wide "cross-generational" appeal; films such as ''[[Raiders of the Lost Arc]]'' were cited as inspiration.<ref name="commentary"/> Despite this, the creators strived to have smaller moments that the audience could relate to and comedy to lighten the darker tone.<ref name="commentary"/> A fairy-tale aspect was also incorporated - highlighted in "The Dragon's Call" with the singing and cobwebs - to set the programme apart from others. ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' was an inspiration in this respect.<ref name="commentary"/> ''Merlin'' was also influenced by the US show ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', about the early years of [[Superman]]; Murphy and Capps said that ''Smallville'' helped provide the idea of a "Camelot that existed before its golden age".<ref name="cues up ads" /> The creators wanted to show Merlin, Arthur, Gwen and Morgana in their youth, "before they were famous".<ref name="behind the magic">{{cite video|people=[[James Hawes|Hawes, James]]; [[Anthony Head]]; [[Colin Morgan]]; Julian Murphy|date=2009|title=Behind the Magic|medium=DVD|publisher=BBC|location=''Merlin: The Complete Series One'' Disc 1}}</ref> Murphy and Capps intended for the four young characters and situations to be relatable to young viewers.<ref name="behind the magic"/> They also put the characters in unusual positions with respect to their later, well-known roles to make the audience wonder how they would reach those roles; for example, Guinevere, the future Queen of Camelot and wife of Arthur, is a servant with a romantic interest in Merlin.<ref name="commentary"/> Looking back at "The Dragon's Call", Murphy and Capps felt that it had so much to introduce in terms of world and characters that there was not enough of the main plot of the episode.<ref name="commentary"/>

===Casting===
[[File:EveMyles.JPG|thumb|left|"The Dragon's Call" guest-starred Eve Myles, who enjoyed playing the villain.]]
The producers were aware that they would be casting young actors with little experience in film and television.<ref name="behind the magic"/> Hundreds were seen for the part of Merlin, with the part going to to 22-year-old [[Colin Morgan]],<ref name="cues up ads"/> whom Murphy and Capps felt possessed a broad acting range with good comedic timing and wonder, and who they felt would most importantly be likable to the audience.<ref name="commentary"/> [[Bradley James]] was cast as Prince Arthur, whom the producers saw as a "medieval [[Prince Harry of Wales|Prince Harry]]". They felt that James' sense of comedy balanced the fact that the character was intended to first appear acting like an "idiot".<ref name="commentary"/> Murphy and Capps had previously worked with James on a pilot, and kept him in the "back of [their] minds" when casting Arthur.<ref name="commentary"/> [[Katie McGrath]] and [[Angel Coulby]], who play Morgana and Gwen respectively, also had little previous professional acting experience.<ref name="behind the magic"/> Despite this, it was noted that all four young actors took to their jobs maturely and with energy.<ref name="behind the magic"/>

The series also incorporates more experienced and well-known actors. [[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]] was cast as Gaius, who was conceived to have a dysfunctional father/son relationship with Merlin. Murphy and Capps had worked with Wilson before and considered him a broad actor with a "warmth" and "humanity" that would fit the character.<ref name="commentary"/> The voice of the Great Dragon was given to [[John Hurt]]; he was offered the part, though the producers did not expect him to accept.<ref name="commentary"/> The role of King Uther went to veteran actor [[Anthony Head]], who was best known for his role as [[Rupert Giles]] in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. Head had been one of the first choices for the part; Murphy and Capps felt that he was good with "high-concept" worlds.<ref name="commentary"/> Murphy and Capps had also previously worked with [[Caroline Faber]], who briefly appears as Merlin's mother. The two liked her sense of humanity, though her scene&nbsp;<U+2014> where Gaius reads her letter&nbsp;<U+2014> was almost cut from "The Dragon's Call".<ref name="commentary"/> [[Eve Myles]] guest stars in "The Dragon's Call" as the villain Mary Collins and her host body Lady Helen. Murphy and Capps remarked that Myles gave a "big" but "truthful" performance, and really "embraced" being a villain.<ref name="commentary"/> Myles sang during the filming of the climax, though her voice was replaced with a real operatic soprano in post-production. Composer Rob Lane was given little time to complete the song and, though he was given [[Old English]] texts, the lyrics do not make actual sense.<ref name="commentary"/>

===Filming===
[[File:Ch<U+00E2>teau de Pierrefonds vu depuis le Parc.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Ch<U+00E2>teau de Pierrefonds in France was used for filming Camelot scenes.]]

Castles in England had been looked at, but they were often in ruins and would require more [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) effects in post-production.<ref name="commentary"/> A medieval-era road was built around Pierrefonds for some scenes to give the sense of a town, as the castle was in isolation.<ref name="commentary"/> The execution scene was one of the first major scenes shot. As the production team had to be able to work with French extras, a bilingual crew was required.<ref name="commentary"/> The cell Merlin is imprisoned in and the banquet hall at the end were both filmed in English stately homes, with real medieval architecture.<ref name="commentary"/> Other studio filming took place in Wales.<ref name="bbcmarch"/> The scene at the camp where Lady Helen stays had to be reshot because the tent was seen as "too [[Monty Python]]" and distracting.<ref name="commentary"/>

Myles' Mary Collins prosthetic took six hours to accomplish, and the shot where she morphs into the younger Lady Helen took seven hours to complete because it required three stages of make-up.<ref name="commentary"/> Her first performance at the beheading scene was met with applause by the extras; Head requested that he redo his part of the scene because he felt that it was not good enough.<ref name="commentary"/> Gaius' fall from the balcony was done by a stuntman and filmed with a high-speed camera.<ref name="commentary"/> The mattress that Merlin magically moves across the floor was achieved with rigging it up to hidden wires and pulleys under the set.<ref name="effects blog">{{cite web|first=Colin|last=Gorry|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/tv/posts/Merlin-The-special-effects|title=Merlin: The special effects|publisher=BBC|date=6 December 2012|accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref> The knives Arthur throws were actually shot out of a nitrogen gun; James did throw them in a separate shot, but against a cloth that he still missed.<ref name="commentary"/> Fake fruit was made for the stocks scene, but it was deemed too fake-looking and was replaced with real tomatoes.<ref name="commentary"/> The mace fight was originally filmed with plastic maces, but they were not believable as they did not have enough weight. The scene was then shot with real steel maces; it was one of the most complex and hardest scenes to execute.<ref name="commentary"/> The climax, where the guests all fall asleep and are covered by cobwebs, took many days to complete. The chandelier falling was also considered difficult.<ref name="commentary"/>

CGI special effects for the series were provided by [[The Mill (post-production)|The Mill]].<ref name="bbcjuly">{{cite press release | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/07_july/23/merlin.shtml | title = Merlin's Secrets Revealed | publisher=BBC Press Office | date = 23 July 2008 | accessdate =18 December 2012}}</ref> The production team wanted a talking a talking dragon, but they were worried about the lip sync and did not think it would be believable until they saw the first test. The Mill created a software that would read Hurt's facial muscles and incorporated it into the animation.<ref name="commentary"/> Another concern was that the eyes would not convey the character, but this was corrected by the final version.<ref name="commentary"/> Additional sound effects, such as the clanging chain, were added to give the creature weight.<ref name="commentary"/> The knife Mary throws at Arthur was also completely CGI, though the shot of it hitting the chair was real.<ref name="commentary"/>

===Critical reception===
{{Quote box
|quote =The entire build up to [the climax] is bizarre at times, because it<U+2019>s like they couldn<U+2019>t decide if this was mythology or a fairytale. Parallels are draw with [[Snow White]], like that's meant to be relevant somehow. Others scenes are supposedly comic, accompanied with some of the campest incidental music that could have been borrowed from a [[Carry On (film series)|Carry-On]] movie. This hints at the mishmash that is ''Merlin'', it's all over the place. One minute it's legend, then slapstick, then panto, then drama, horror and then mystery [...].

The premiere of ''Merlin'' received generally mixed reviews. Sam Wollaston of ''[[The Guardian]]'' was optimistic towards the programme, despite the violent content. He wrote that "Morgan is a very likable young Merlin" and the show "looks splendid&nbsp;<U+2014> colourful, exciting, and yes, magic".<ref name="Wollaston">{{cite web|first=Sam|last=Wollaston|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2008/sep/22/television1|title=Last night's TV|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 September 2008|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> Daniel Martin of the same paper felt that the series had potential, though "The Dragon's Call" had "awful dialogue" and was "a flimsy caper memorable only for centring around the wonderful big-eyed Eve Myles".<ref name="guardian martin">{{cite web|first=Daniel|last=Martin|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/sep/19/merlin.bbcseries|title=It might take a magician to make Merlin work|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 September 2009|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reviewer Randee Dawn felt that it would "hurt [the] eyes" of those who were familiar with the Arthurian legends, but "for those new to the legend, this is a fresh, and delightfully [[Colour-blind casting|color-blind]], approach to the tale".<ref name="hollywood reporter">{{cite web|first=Randee|last=Dawn|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/tv-reviews/merlin-tv-review-1003986246.story|archivedate=21 June 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090621114142/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/tv-reviews/merlin-tv-review-1003986246.story|title=Merlin TV Review|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=19 June 2009|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> Alessandra Stanley, reviewing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', was pleased with the diversity of the cast and the chemistry between Morgan and James, though she felt it "would be better if its creators had taken more liberties and shown more imagination in coloring in the background of their young hero's world".<ref>{{cite news|first=Alessandra|last=Stanley|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/19/arts/television/19merlin.html?_r=0|title=Once and Future Sorcerer|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=18 June 2009|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref>

''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' gave the episode three out of five stars, writing that "Colin Morgan makes a likeable boy wizard but there<U+2019>s a bit too much formula&nbsp;<U+2013> and not in the magical sense".<ref name="metro"/> The review described the episode as a "test of patience" due to Merlin's inability to use magic and the "hideously jaunty, distinctly non-medieval soundtrack".<ref name="metro">{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2008/09/21/merlin-fails-the-spelling-test-508801/|title=Merlin fails the spelling test|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=21 September 2008|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> Tom Shales of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' criticised the "sluggish pace" of the premiere, noting that the episode was only "brightened" by the dragon, though similar creatures were common in the genre and it "lacks personality as well as panache".<ref name="washington post"/> Shales felt that the series took "the stuff of legend and imagination and makes it dry and commonplace".<ref name="washington post">{{cite web|first=Tom|last=Shales|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/19/AR2009061903307.html|title=Tom Shales's TV Preview of 'Merlin' on NBC|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=20 June 2009|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> Den of Geek reviewer Mark Pickavance felt that the episode was "uneven and often very stilted", and failed at introducing both the characters and telling the story of the first meeting of Arthur and Merlin.<ref name="den of geek"/> He was displeased with the deviation from established mythology and the lapses in logic.<ref name="den of geek">{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Pickavance|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/merlin/9035/merlin-episode-1-review|title=Merlin episode 1 review|publisher=Den of Geek|date=21 September 2008|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> ''[[The Times]]''{{'s}} AA Gill described ''Merlin'' as "bland", writing that it was for "a large untapped audience that yearns for [[Abercrombie & Fitch]] drama".<ref name="the times">{{cite web|first=AA|last=Gill|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article4774869.ece|archivedate=15 June 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110615123619/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article4774869.ece|title=The Family&nbsp;<U+2014> a template for reality TV|work=[[The Times]]|date=21 September 2008|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> Hermione Eyre of ''[[The Independent]]'' called it "horrible", disliking the "modern" feeling, the "awful" make-up, and commented that "Guinevere looks like a [[substitute teacher|supply teacher]]".<ref name="independent">{{cite news|first=Hermione|last=Eyre|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-and-tv/tv-radio-reviews/tess-of-the-durbervilles-bbc1brthe-family-channel-4brmerlin-bbc1-936711.html|archivedate=27 September 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080927085354/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-and-tv/tv-radio-reviews/tess-of-the-durbervilles-bbc1brthe-family-channel-4brmerlin-bbc1-936711.html|title=Tess of the D'Urbervilles, BBC1; The Family, Channel 4; Merlin, BBC1|work=[[The Independent]]|date=21 September 2008|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref>
