The '''Sandav<U+00E1>gur stone''' (FR 2 M) is a [[runestone]] that was discovered in the town of [[Sandav<U+00E1>gur]] on [[the Faroe Islands]] in 1917.<ref>According to the [[Sandav<U+00E1>gur]] article.</ref> The stone can today be seen in the [[Sandav<U+00E1>gur Church]].

The inscription speaks of <U+00DE>orkell, a man from [[Rogaland]], [[Norway]] who claims to have lived on that place first. He is presumably one of the first settlers, if not the very first one, in the Sandav<U+00E1>gur area. In both runes and language the Sandav<U+00E1>gur stone corresponds to what is known from Rogaland around the 13th century.<ref>[http://www.arild-hauge.com/vesterhavsruner.htm FR 2 - Sandavagur runesten]</ref>
