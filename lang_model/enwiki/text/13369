'''HMS ''Indefatigable''''' was a [[battlecruiser]] of the [[Royal Navy]], the [[lead ship]] of [[Indefatigable class battlecruiser|her class]]. She was essentially a lengthened version of [[HMS Invincible (1907)|HMS ''Invincible'']], with additional room added amidships to allow both 'P' and 'Q' turrets to fire on either broadside. When [[World War I]] began she was in the Mediterranean, where she pursued the German warships {{SMS|Goeben||2}} and {{SMS|Breslau||2}} as they fled towards Turkey. She bombarded Turkish fortifications defending the [[Dardanelles]] on 3 November 1914 before returning to the [[United Kingdom]] in February 1915 where she was assigned to the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron. She was part of Admiral Beatty's Battlecruiser Fleet in May 1916 and was destroyed by a magazine explosion during the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May.

==Design==
[[File:Indefatigable class battlecruiser diagrams Brasseys 1923.jpg|thumb|left|300px|<center>Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1923</center>]]
The ''Indefatigable'' was ordered as the lone battlecruiser of the 1908<U+2013>9 programme. Her outline design was prepared in March 1908, and the final design was approved in November 1908. This design was essentially an enlarged {{HMS|Invincible|1908|6}} with revised arrangements of protection and main armament.<ref>Roberts, p. 28</ref>

==Construction==
''Indefatigable'' was laid down at the [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport Dockyard]], [[Plymouth]] on 23 February 1909. She was launched on 28 October 1909 and was completed on 24 February 1911.<ref>Roberts, p. 41</ref> She had an [[length overall|overall]] length of {{convert|590|ft|m|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|80|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|29|ft|9|in|m|1|abbr=on}} at deep load. She displaced {{convert|18500|LT|MT}} at load and {{convert|22130|LT|MT}} at deep load.<ref>Roberts, pp. 43<U+2013>44</ref> Her turbines were designed to produce a total of {{convert|43000|ihp}}, but reached over {{convert|55000|ihp|lk=in|abbr=on}} during trials in 1911. They were designed for {{convert|25|kn|km/h|0}}, but she reached {{convert|26.89|kn|km/h|0}} during trials.<ref>Roberts, pp. 76, 80</ref>

''Indefatigable'' carried eight [[BL 12 inch Mk X naval gun|BL {{convert|12|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=4}} Mk X guns]] in four BVIII* twin [[turret]]s. Two turrets were mounted fore and aft on the centreline, identified as 'A' and 'X' respectively. Two turrets were mounted amidships en echelon between the funnels, identified as 'P' and 'Q'. 'P' and 'Q' turrets had some limited ability to fire to the opposite side. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen [[BL 4 inch naval gun Mk VII|{{convert|4|in|abbr=on|0}} BL Mk VII guns]] positioned in the superstructure.<ref>Roberts, pp. 81<U+2013>84</ref> She mounted two [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (450-mm)]] submerged [[torpedo tube]]s, one on each side aft of 'X' barbette, and twelve torpedoes were carried.<ref>Campbell, p. 14</ref>

During a prewar refit ''Indefatigable''{{'}}s 'A' turret was fitted with a {{convert|9|ft|adj=on}} rangefinder at the rear of the turret roof. It was also equipped to control the entire main armament to guard against this possibility of normal fire control positions being knocked out or rendered incommunicado.<ref>Roberts, pp. 90<U+2013>91</ref>

===Wartime modifications===
''Indefatigable'' received a single [[QF 3 inch 20 cwt]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] gun on a high-angle MKII mount that was added in March 1915.<ref name=c3/> This had a maximum depression of 10<U+00B0> and a maximum elevation of 90<U+00B0>. It fired a {{convert|12.5|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2500|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of fire of 12<U+2013>14 rounds per minute. It had a maximum effective ceiling of {{convert|23500|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_3-45_mk1.htm|title=British 12-pdr [3"/45 (76.2 cm)] 20cwt QF HA Marks I, II, III and IV |date=27 February 2007|accessdate=11 November 2009}}</ref> It was provided with 500 rounds. All of her 4-inch guns were enclosed in [[casemate]]s and given blast shields during a refit in November 1915 to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action, although two aft guns were removed at the same time.<ref name=c3>Campbell, p. 13</ref>

She received a [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire control director]] between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralized fire control under the director officer who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy as it was easier to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells as each turret fired on their own.<ref>Roberts, pp. 92<U+2013>93</ref>
 
==Career==
===Early career===
Upon commissioning, ''Indefatigable'' served in the 1st Cruiser Squadron, which in January 1913 was renamed the [[1st Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|1st Battlecruiser Squadron]]. In December 1913, she transferred to the [[Mediterranean]] where she served in the [[2nd Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|2nd Battlecruiser Squadron]].

===Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau===
{{Main|Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau}}
''Indefatigable'', accompanied by {{HMS|Indomitable|1907|2}}, under the command of [[Admiral]] [[Archibald Berkeley Milne|Sir Archibald Berkeley Milne]], encountered the battlecruiser ''Goeben'' and the light cruiser ''Breslau'' on the morning of 4 August 1914 headed east after a cursory bombardment of the French Algerian port of [[Philippeville, Algeria|Philippeville]], but Britain and Germany were not yet at war so Milne turned to shadow the Germans as they headed back to [[Messina]] to recoal. All three battlecruisers had problems with their boilers, but ''Goeben'' and ''Breslau'' were able to break contact and reached Messina by the morning of the 5th. By this time war had been declared, after the German invasion of Belgium, but an Admiralty order to respect Italian neutrality and stay outside a six-mile (10&nbsp;km) limit from the Italian coast precluded entrance into the passage of the [[Strait of Messina]] where they could observe the port directly. Therefore Milne stationed {{HMS|Inflexible|1907|2}} and ''Indefatigable'' at the northern exit of the Straits of Messina, still expecting the Germans to break out to the west where they could attack French troop transports, the light cruiser {{HMS|Gloucester|1909|2}} at the southern exit and sent ''Indomitable'' to recoal at [[Bizerte]] where she was better positioned to react to a German sortie into the Western Mediterranean.<ref>Massie, p. 39</ref>

The Germans [[sortie]]d from Messina on 6 August and headed east, towards [[Constantinople]], trailed by ''Gloucester''. Milne, still expecting [[Rear Admiral]] [[Wilhelm Souchon]] to turn west, kept the battlecruisers at Malta until shortly after midnight on 8 August when he set sail for [[Cape Matapan]], where Goeben had been spotted eight hours earlier, at a leisurely {{convert|12|kn|km/h|0}}. At 2:30 p.m. he received an incorrect signal from the Admiralty stating that Britain was at war with Austria <U+2014> war would not be declared until 12 August and the order was countermanded four hours later, but Milne followed his standing orders to guard the Adriatic against an Austrian breakout attempt, rather than seek ''Goeben''. Finally on 9 August Milne was given clear orders to "chase ''Goeben'' which had passed Cape Matapan on the 7th steering north-east." Milne still did not believe that Souchon was heading for the Dardanelles, and so he resolved to guard the exit from the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], unaware that the ''Goeben'' did not intend to come out.<ref>Massie, pp. 45<U+2013>46</ref>

On 3 November 1914, [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] ordered the first British attack on the Dardanelles following the opening of hostilities between Turkey and Russia. The attack was carried out by ''Indomitable'' and ''Indefatigable'', as well as the French [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s [[French battleship Suffren|''Suffren'']] and [[French battleship V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9> (1907)|''V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>'']]. The intention of the attack was to test the fortifications and measure the Turkish response. The results were deceptively encouraging. In a twenty minute bombardment, a single shell struck the magazine of the fort at [[Sedd el Bahr]] at the tip of the Gallipoli peninsula, displacing (but not destroying) 10 guns and killing 86 Turkish soldiers. The most significant consequence was that the attention of the Turks was drawn to strengthening their defences, and they set about expanding the mine field.<ref>Carlyon, p. 47</ref> This attack actually took place before a formal [[declaration of war]] had been made by Britain against the [[Ottoman Empire]] which didn't happen until 6 November. ''Indefatigable'' was remained in the Mediterranean until she was relieved by ''Inflexible'' on 24 January 1915 and proceeded to Malta to refit. Having completed her refit she sailed to England on 14 February where she joined the [[2nd Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|2nd Battlecruiser Squadron]] (BCS) upon her arrival. She was the temporary flagship of the 2nd BCS during April<U+2013>May 1916 while her half-sister ''Australia'' was under repair after having collided with her other half-sister ''New Zealand''.<ref>Burt, p. 103</ref>

===Battle of Jutland===  
{{Main|Battle of Jutland}}
[[Image:HMS Indefatigable sinking.jpg|thumb|left|200px|HMS ''Indefatigable'' sinking after being struck by shells from the German battlecruiser ''Von der Tann'']]
On 31 May 1916 the 2nd BCS consisted of ''New Zealand'' (Flagship of Rear Admiral [[William Christopher Pakenham]] and ''Indefatigable'' as ''Australia'' was still under repair following her collision with ''New Zealand'' on 22 April.<ref>Burt, p. 104</ref> It was assigned to Admiral Beatty's Battlecruiser Fleet which had put to sea to intercept a sortie by the [[High Seas Fleet]] into the North Sea. The British were able to decode the German radio messages and left their bases before the Germans put to sea. Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 3:20,<ref group=Note>The times used in this section are in [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], which is one hour ahead of [[Central European Time|CET]], which is often used in German works.</ref> but Beatty's ships didn't spot the Germans to their east until 2:30. Almost immediately afterwards, at 3:32, he ordered a course change to east south-east to position himself astride the German's line of retreat and called his ships' crews to action stations. He also ordered the 2nd BCS, which had been leading, to fall in astern of the 1st BCS. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to port, away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h}} to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, then about {{convert|60|mi}} behind him. Around this time Beatty altered course to the east as it was quickly apparent that he was still far too north to cut off Hipper.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 69, 71, 75</ref>

This began what was to be called the 'Run to the South' as Beatty changed course to steer east south-east at 3:45, paralleling Hipper's course, now that the range closed to under {{convert|18000|yd}}. The Germans opened fire first at 3:48, followed almost immediately afterwards by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships, {{HMS|Lion|1910|2}} and {{HMS|Princess Royal|1911|2}} had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The British formation was echeloned to the right with ''Indefatigable'' in the rear and the furthest to the west, and ''New Zealand'' ahead of her and slightly further east. The German fire was accurate from the beginning, but the British over-estimated the range as the German ships blended into the haze. ''Indefatigable'' aimed at {{SMS|Von der Tann||2}} while ''New Zealand'' aimed at {{SMS|Moltke|1910|2}} while remaining unengaged herself. By 3:54 the range was down to {{convert|12900|yd}} and Beatty ordered a course change two [[Boxing the compass|points]] to starboard to open up the range at 3:57. Around 4:00 ''Indefatigable'' was hit by two or three shells from ''Von der Tann'' around the rear turret and almost immediately fell off to starboard and was down by the stern and listing to port. She was hit twice more on the next volley, once on the forecastle and the other on the forward turret, and blew up at about 4:03 when her magazines exploded.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 80<U+2013>85</ref> The most likely cause of her loss was a low-order explosion in 'X' magazine that blew out her bottom and severed the control shafts between the steering engines and the steering gear, followed by the explosion of her forward magazines from the second volley.<ref>Roberts, p. 116</ref> ''Von der Tann'' only fired 52 {{convert|28|cm|abbr=on}} shells at ''Indefatigable'' before she exploded, taking 1017 men with her. Only two survivors were rescued by the German torpedo boat {{SMS|S68||2}}.<ref>Tarrant, p. 85</ref>

==''Indefatigable'' today==
The wreck today is one of the most difficult of all the Jutland wrecks to locate. Commercial salvage during the 1950s reduced the ship to nothing more than a mass of metal, with most chunks hardly bigger than a standard hatchback car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwpda.org/naval/jut07wrk.htm|title=The Wrecks of Jutland|accessdate=27 October 2009}}</ref> The ''Indefatigable'', along with the other Jutland wrecks, has belatedly been declared a ''protected place'' under the [[Protection of Military Remains Act 1986]] to discourage further damage to the resting place of 1,015 officers and men.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2006/20062616.htm|title=Statutory Instrument 2006 No. 2616  The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 (Designation of Vessels and Controlled Sites) Order 2006|publisher=Queen's Printer of Acts of Parliament|accessdate=20 November 2009}}</ref>
