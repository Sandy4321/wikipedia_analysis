'''Patrice <U+00C9>mery Lumumba''' (2 July 1925 <U+2013> 17 January 1961) was a Congolese independence leader and the first legally elected [[Prime Minister]] of the [[Republic of the Congo (L<U+00E9>opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] after he helped win its independence from [[Belgium]] in June 1960. Only ten weeks later, Lumumba's government was deposed in a coup during the [[Congo Crisis]].<ref name=Zeilig>{{cite book

==Path to Prime Minister==
Lumumba was born in Onalua in the [[Katakokombe]] region of the [[Kasai region|Kasai]] province of the [[Belgian Congo]], a member of the [[Tetela people|Tetela]] ethnic group. Raised in a Catholic family as one of four sons, he was educated at a Protestant primary school, a Catholic missionary school, and finally the government post office training school, passing the one-year course with distinction. He subsequently worked in Leopoldville (now [[Kinshasa]]) and Stanleyville (now [[Kisangani]]) as a postal clerk and as a travelling beer salesman. In 1951, he married Pauline Opangu. In 1955, Lumumba became regional head of the ''Cercles'' of Stanleyville and joined the [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal Party of Belgium]], where he worked on editing and distributing party literature. After traveling on a three-week study tour in Belgium, he was arrested in 1955 on charges of embezzlement of post office funds. His two-year sentence was commuted to twelve months after it was confirmed by Belgian lawyer Jules Chrome that Lumumba had returned the funds, and he was released in July 1956. After his release, he helped found the broad-based [[Mouvement National Congolais]] (MNC) in 1958, later becoming the organization's president. Lumumba and his team represented the MNC at the [[All-African Peoples' Conference]] in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]], in December 1958. At this international conference, hosted by influential [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-African]] President [[Kwame Nkrumah]] of Ghana, Lumumba further solidified his Pan-Africanist beliefs.

[[File:PatricelumumbaIISG.jpg|thumb|220px|Patrice Lumumba]]

In late October 1959, Lumumba as leader of the MNC was again arrested for allegedly inciting an anti-colonial riot in Stanleyville where thirty people were killed, for which he was sentenced to six months in prison. The trial's start date of 18 January 1960, was also the first day of a round-table conference in Brussels to finalize the future of the Congo. Despite Lumumba's imprisonment at the time, the MNC won a convincing majority in the December local elections in the Congo. As a result of pressure from delegates who were enraged at Lumumba's imprisonment, he was released and allowed to attend the [[Brussels]] conference. The conference culminated on January 27 with a declaration of Congolese independence setting June 30, 1960, as the independence date with [[Belgian Congo general election, 1960|national elections from 11<U+2013>25 May 1960]]. Lumumba and the MNC won this election and the right to form a government, with the announcement on 23 June 1960 of 34-year-old Lumumba as Congo's first prime minister and [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] as its president. In accordance with the constitution, on 24 June the new government passed a vote of confidence and was ratified by the Congolese Chamber and Senate.

Independence Day was celebrated on June 30 in a ceremony attended by many dignitaries including [[Baudouin of Belgium|King Baudouin]] and the foreign press. Patrice Lumumba delivered his famous independence speech after being officially excluded from the event programme, despite being the new prime minister.<ref name="speech">{{cite web|title = Independence Day Speech|publisher=Africa Within|url=http://www.africawithin.com/lumumba/independence_speech.htm| accessdate=15 July 2006}}</ref> The speech of King Baudouin praised developments under colonialism, his reference to the "genius" of his great-granduncle [[Leopold II of Belgium]] glossing over atrocities committed during the [[Congo Free State]].<ref name="dw">Adam Hochschild, 'King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa', 1999, Mariner Books, ISBN 0618001905, ISBN 978-0618001903.</ref> The King continued, "Don't compromise the future with hasty reforms, and don't replace the structures that Belgium hands over to you until you are sure you can do better... Don't be afraid to come to us.  We will remain by your side, give you advice."<ref name=chukw>Kamalu, Chukwunyere. ''The Little African History Book - Black Africa from the Origins of Humanity''. page 115</ref> Lumumba responded by reminding the audience that the independence of the Congo was not granted magnanimously by Belgium:<ref name=chukw />

<blockquote>For this independence of the Congo, even as it is celebrated today with Belgium, a friendly country with whom we deal as equal to equal, no Congolese worthy of the name will ever be able to forget that it was by fighting that it has been won, a day-to-day fight, an ardent and idealistic fight, a fight in which we were spared neither privation nor suffering, and for which we gave our strength and our blood. We are proud of this struggle, of tears, of fire, and of blood, to the depths of our being, for it was a noble and just struggle, and indispensable to put an end to the humiliating slavery which was imposed upon us by force.<ref name=chukw /></blockquote>

In contrast to the relatively harmless speech of President Kasa-Vubu, Lumumba's reference to the suffering of the Congolese under Belgian colonialism stirred the crowd while simultaneously humiliating and alienating the King and his entourage.  The media claimed at the time that he ended his speech by ad-libbing, ''Nous ne sommes plus vos [[macaca (slur)|macaques]]!'' (We are no longer your monkeys!) --referring to a common slur used against Africans by Belgians, however, these words are neither in his written text nor in radio tapes of his speech.<ref name="dw">Ludo De Witte, ''The Assassination of Lumumba'', Trans. by Ann Wright and Ren<U+00E9>e Fenby, 2002 (Orig. 2001), London; New York: Verso, ISBN 1-85984-410-3, pp. 1-3.</ref><ref name="marred">{{cite news | title = Marred: Lumumba's offensive speech in King's presence | publisher = Guardian Unlimited|url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/congo/story/0,,766933,00.html| accessdate = 14 August 2006 | location=London | date=1 July 1960}}</ref> Lumumba was later harshly criticised for what many in the West<U+2014>but virtually none in Africa<U+2014>described as the inappropriate nature of his speech.<ref>A History of the Modern World, Johnson P, Weidenfeld, London, (1991)</ref>

==Actions as Prime Minister==
A few days after Congo gained its independence, Lumumba made the fateful decision to raise the pay of all government employees except for the army. Many units of the army also had strong objections toward the uniformly Belgian officers; General Janssens, the army head, told them their lot would not change after independence, and they rebelled in protest. The rebellions quickly spread throughout the country, leading to a general breakdown in law and order.  Although the trouble was highly localized, the country seemed to be  overrun by gangs of soldiers and looters, causing a media sensation, particularly over Europeans fleeing the country.<ref name="devlin">Larry Devlin, ''Chief of Station Congo'', 2007, Public Affairs, ISBN 1-58648-405-2</ref>

The province of [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] declared independence under regional premier [[Moise Tshombe|Mo<U+00EF>se Tshombe]] on 11 July 1960 with support from the Belgian government and mining companies such as [[Union Mini<U+00E8>re du Haut Katanga|Union Mini<U+00E8>re]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Compatible Cultural Democracy |last= Osabu-Kle |first= Daniel Tetteh |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2000 |publisher= Broadview Press |location= |isbn= 1551112892 |page= 254 |url= }}</ref> Despite the arrival of [[United Nations|UN]] troops, unrest continued. Since the United Nations refused to help suppress the rebellion in Katanga, Lumumba sought [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] aid in the form of arms, food, medical supplies, trucks, and planes to help move troops to Katanga. Lumumba's decisive actions alarmed his colleagues and President Kasa-Vubu, who preferred a more moderate political approach.<ref>Johnson. P, ibid</ref>

==Deposition and arrest==
In September, the President dismissed Lumumba from government. Lumumba immediately protested the legality of the President's actions. In retaliation, Lumumba declared Kasa-Vubu deposed and won a vote of confidence in the Senate, while the newly appointed prime minister failed to gain parliament's confidence. The country was torn by two political groups claiming legal power over the country. On 14 September, a [[coup d<U+2019><U+00E9>tat]] organised by Colonel [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Joseph Mobutu]] and endorsed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] incapacitated both Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu.<ref name="devlin" /> Lumumba was placed under house arrest at the prime minister's residence, although [[UN]] troops were positioned around the house to protect him. Nevertheless, Lumumba decided to rouse his supporters in Haut-Congo. Smuggled out of his residence at night, he escaped to Stanleyville, where he attempted to set up his own government and army.<ref>Longman History of Africa, Snellgrove L. and Greenberg K., Longman, London (1973)</ref> Pursued by troops loyal to Mobutu he was finally captured in [[Port Francqui]] on 1 December 1960 and flown to [[Kinshasa|Leopoldville]] (now Kinshasa) in handcuffs. He desperately appealed to local UN troops to save him, but he was no longer their responsibility. Mobutu said Lumumba would be tried for inciting the army to rebellion and other crimes. [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[Dag Hammarskj<U+00F6>ld]] made an appeal to Kasa-Vubu asking that Lumumba be treated according to [[Due process|due process of law]]. The [[USSR]] denounced Hammarskj<U+00F6>ld and the [[Western countries|Western powers]] as responsible for Lumumba's arrest and demanded his release.

The [[UN Security Council]] was called into session on 7 December 1960 to consider Soviet demands that the UN seek Lumumba's immediate release, the immediate restoration of Lumumba as head of the Congo government, the disarming of the forces of Mobutu, and the immediate evacuation of Belgians from the Congo. Hammarskj<U+00F6>ld, answering Soviet attacks against his Congo operations, said that if the UN forces were withdrawn from the Congo "I fear everything will crumble."

The threat to the UN cause was intensified by the announcement of the withdrawal of their contingents by [[Yugoslavia]], the [[United Arab Republic]], [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], [[Indonesia]], [[Morocco]], and [[Guinea]]. The Soviet pro-Lumumba resolution was defeated on 14 December 1960 by a vote of 8-2. On the same day, a Western resolution that would have given Hammarskj<U+00F6>ld increased powers to deal with the Congo situation was vetoed by the Soviet Union.

Lumumba was sent first on 3 December, to [[Thysville]] military barracks Camp Hardy, 150&nbsp;km (about 100 miles) from Leopoldville. However, when security and disciplinary breaches threatened his safety, it was decided that he should be transferred to the [[Katanga Province]].

==Death==
Lumumba was forcibly restrained on the flight to Elizabethville (now [[Lubumbashi]]) on 17 January 1961.<ref name="bbc-wkl">{{cite news|title=Correspondent:Who Killed Lumumba-Transcript|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/audio_video/programmes/correspondent/transcripts/974745.txt|publisher=BBC | accessdate=21 May 2010}} 00.35.38-00.35.49</ref> On arrival, he was conducted under arrest to Brouwez House and held there bound and gagged while President Tshombe and his cabinet decided what to do with him.

Later that night, Lumumba was driven to an isolated spot where three firing squads had been assembled. According to David Akerman, Ludo de Witte and Kris Hollington,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Wolves, Jackals and Foxes: The Assassins Who Changed History |last=Hollington |first=Kris |year=2007 |publisher=True Crime |isbn=9780312378998 |pages= 50<U+2013>65 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I8LHU4f_hkQC&lpg=PP1&dq=isbn%3A9780312378998&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=2010-12-11 |quote= }}</ref> the firing squads were commanded by a Belgian, Captain Julien Gat, and another Belgian, Police Commissioner Verscheure, had overall command of the execution site.<ref name="bbc-wkl-1">{{cite news|title=Correspondent:Who Killed Lumumba-Transcript|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/audio_video/programmes/correspondent/transcripts/974745.txt|publisher=BBC | accessdate=21 May 2010}} 00.36.57</ref> The Belgian Commission has found that the execution was carried out by Katanga's authorities, but de Witte found written orders from the Belgian government requesting Lumumba's murder and documents on various arrangements, such as death squads. It reported that President Tshombe and two other ministers were present with four Belgian officers under the command of Katangan authorities. Lumumba and two other comrades from the government, Maurice Mpolo and Joseph Okito, were lined up against a tree and shot one at a time. The execution probably took place on 17 January 1961 between 21:40 and 21:43 according to the Belgian report. Lumumba's corpse was buried nearby.

No statement was released until three weeks later despite rumours that Lumumba was dead. His death was formally announced on Katangese radio when it was alleged that he escaped and was killed by enraged villagers. On January 18, panicked by reports that the burial of the three bodies had been observed, members of the murder team went to dig up the bodies and move them to a place near the border with Rhodesia for reburial. Belgian Police Commissioner Gerard Soete later admitted in several accounts that he and his brother led the first and a second exhumation. Police Commissioner Frans Verscheure also took part. On the afternoon and evening of January 21, Commissioner Soete and his brother dug up Lumumba's corpse for the second time, cut it up with a hacksaw, and dissolved it in concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] (de Witte 2002:140-143).<ref name=usnews>{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/doubleissue/mysteries/patrice.htm |title=Patrice Lumumba - Mysteries of History |publisher=Usnews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-17}}</ref> Only some teeth and a fragment of skull and bullets survived the process, kept as souvenirs. In an interview on Belgian television in a program on the assassination of Lumumba in 1999, Soete displayed a bullet and two teeth that he boasted he had saved from Lumumba's body.<ref name=usnews /> De Witte also mentions that Verscheure kept souvenirs from the exhumation: bullets from the skull of Lumumba.<ref>de Witte 2002: 140</ref>

After the announcement of Lumumba's death, street protests were organised in several European countries; in [[Belgrade]], capital of Yugoslavia, protesters sacked the Belgian embassy and confronted the police, and in London a crowd marched from [[Trafalgar Square]] to the Belgian embassy, where a letter of protest was delivered and where protesters clashed with police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/19/newsid_2748000/2748931.stm |title=BBC: "1961: Lumumba rally clashes with UK police" |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-02-19 |accessdate=2011-01-17}}</ref>

The Belgian Commission investigating Lumumba's assassination concluded that (1) Belgium wanted Lumumba arrested, (2) Belgium was not particularly concerned with Lumumba's physical well being, and (3) although informed of the danger to Lumumba's life, Belgium did not take any action to avert his death, but the report also specifically denied that Belgium ordered Lumumba's assassination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E4DF123BF934A25752C1A9679C8B63 |title=Report Reproves Belgium in Lumumba's Death |location=Belgium; Congo (Formerly Zaire) |publisher=New York Times |date=2001-11-17 |accessdate=2011-01-17}}</ref>

Under its own [[Good Samaritan law|'Good Samaritan' laws]], Belgium was legally culpable for failing to prevent the assassination from taking place and was also in breach of its obligation (under U.N. Resolution 290 of 1949) to refrain from acts or threats "aimed at impairing the freedom, independence or integrity of another state."<ref>{{cite book |title= Encyclopedia of the United Nations and international agreements|last= Osma<U+0144>czyk|first= Edmund Jan|coauthors= Mango, Anthony|year=2003|publisher= Taylor&Francis|isbn= 0415939240|page= 2571}}</ref>

It was revealed that U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] had said "something [to CIA chief [[Allen Dulles]]] to the effect that Lumumba should be eliminated".<ref name="grauniad">http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4049783,00.html</ref> This was revealed by a declassified interview with then-US National Security Council minutekeeper Robert Johnson released in August 2000 from Senate intelligence committee's inquiry on covert action. The committee later found that while the CIA had conspired to kill Lumumba, it was not directly involved in the actual murder.<ref name="grauniad"/> In 1975, the [[Church Committee]] went on record with the finding that Allen Dulles had ordered Lumumba's assassination as "an urgent and prime objective" (Dulles' own words).<ref>William Blum ''Killing Hope'', p. 158, MBI Publishing Co., 2007 ISBN 978-0760324578</ref> Furthermore, declassified CIA cables quoted or mentioned in the Church report and in Kalb (1972) mention two specific CIA plots to murder Lumumba: the poison plot and a shooting plot. Although some sources claim that CIA plots ended when Lumumba was captured, that is not stated or shown in the CIA records. Rather, those records show two still-partly-censored CIA cables from Elizabethville on days significant in the murder: January 17, the day Lumumba died, and January 18, the day of the first exhumation. The former, after a long censored section, talks about where they need to go from there. The latter expresses thanks for Lumumba being sent to them and then says that, had Elizabethville base known he was coming, they would have "baked a snake".<ref>FOIA declassified documents on Lumumba on the CIA website</ref> Significantly, a CIA officer told another CIA officer later that he had had Lumumba's body in the trunk of his car to try to find a way to dispose of it.<ref>John Stockwell ''In Search of Enemies: A CIA Story''. W.W. Norton, 1978: 105</ref> This cable goes on to state that the writer's sources (not yet declassified) said that after being taken from the airport Lumumba was imprisoned by "all white guards".<ref>CIA document #CO 1366116</ref>

==Plots by U.S. and Belgium==
The report of 2001 by the Belgian Commission mentions that there had been previous U.S. and Belgian plots to kill Lumumba.  Among them was a [[Central Intelligence Agency]]-sponsored attempt to poison him, which may have come on orders from U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|title = President 'ordered murder' of Congo leader| work = [[The Guardian]]|url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4049783,00.html|accessdate = 18 June 2006| location=London | first=Martin | last=Kettle | date=10 August 2000}}</ref> CIA chemist [[Sidney Gottlieb]] was a key person in this by devising a poison resembling toothpaste.<ref>[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/top06.pdf 6) Plan to poison Congo leader Patrice Lumumba (p. 464)], [[Family jewels (CIA)|Family jewels CIA documents]], on the [[National Security Archive]]'s website</ref><ref name="USN">{{cite web | title=A killing in Congo|work=[[US News]]|url = http://www.usnews.com/usnews/doubleissue/mysteries/patrice.htm|accessdate = 18 June 2006}}</ref><ref name="AWKILL">{{cite web|title = Who killed Lumumba| publisher ="Africa Within"|url = http://www.africawithin.com/lumumba/who_killed_lumumba.htm}}</ref><ref name = gottliebcp>Sidney Gottlieb "obituary" {{cite web|title = Sidney Gottlieb|publisher = Counterpunch.org|url = http://www.counterpunch.org/gottlieb.html}}</ref> However, the plan is said to have been scrapped because the local CIA Station Chief, [[Larry Devlin]], refused permission.<ref name="USN" /><ref name="AWKILL" /><ref name = garsincp>{{cite web|title = Interview with Mark Garsin|publisher =Counterpunch.org|url= http://www.counterpunch.org/mazur01292005.html}}</ref> However, as Kalb points out in her book, ''Congo Cables'', the record shows that many communications by Devlin at the time urged elimination of Lumumba (p.&nbsp;53, 101, 129-133, 149-152, 158-159, 184-185, 195). Also, the CIA station chief helped to direct the search to capture Lumumba for his transfer to his enemies in Katanga, was involved in arranging his transfer to Katanga (p.&nbsp;158, Hoyt, Michael P. 2009, "Captive in the Congo: A Consul's Return to the Heart of Darkness"), and the CIA base chief in Elizabethville was in direct touch with the killers the night Lumumba was killed.  Furthermore, a CIA agent had the body in the trunk of his car in order to try to get rid of it (p.&nbsp;105, Stockwell, John 1978 ''In Search of Enemies: A CIA Story''. Stockwell, who knew Devlin well, felt Devlin knew more than anyone else about the murder (71-72, 136-137).

In February 2002, the Belgian government apologised to the Congolese people, and admitted to a "moral responsibility" and "an irrefutable portion of responsibility in the events that led to the death of Lumumba." In July, documents released by the United States government revealed that while the CIA had been kept informed of Belgium's plans, it had no direct role in Lumumba's eventual death.<ref name="USN" />

This same disclosure showed that U.S. perception at the time was that Lumumba was a [[communist]].<ref>Blaine Harden, ''Africa: Dispatches from a Fragile Continent'', p. 50</ref> Eisenhower's reported call, at a meeting of his national security advisers, for Lumumba's elimination must have been brought on by this perception. Both Belgium and the US were clearly influenced in their unfavourable stance towards Lumumba by the [[Cold War]]. He seemed to gravitate around the Soviet Union, although this was not because he was a communist but the only place he could find support in his country's effort to rid itself of colonial rule.<ref>Sean Kelly, ''America's Tyrant: The CIA and Mobutu of Zaire'', p. 29</ref> The US was the first country from which Lumumba requested help.<ref>Kelly, p. 28</ref> Lumumba, for his part, not only denied being a Communist, but said he found colonialism and Communism to be equally deplorable, and professed his personal preference for neutrality between the [[Eastern bloc|East]] and [[Western world|West]].<ref>Kelly, p. 49</ref>

===Political===
The results of his time in office are both mixed and polarising in their subsequent interpretation. To his critics, Lumumba bequeathed very few positive results from his term of office. Their critiques include his inability to promote development and failure to stave off or quell a civil war that erupted within days of his appointment as prime minister. Instead, he behaved impetuously and followed expedients rather than policies that led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, including himself.<ref>Johnson, P. ibid. pp515-17</ref>

To his supporters, Lumumba was an altruistic man of strong character who pursued his policies regardless of opposing viewpoints.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} He favoured a unitary Congo and opposed division of the country along ethnic or regional lines.<ref>{{cite news |title=Lumumba Facing Separatist Bids |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10E14FC385916738DDDA00894D0405B808AF1D3 |agency=AP |newspaper=New York Times |date=9 August 1960 |page=1 |accessdate=2010-11-08 |quote= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Congo Troops Fly To Kasai To Stop Secession Effort; Lumumba Acts to Crush Bid to Create a New State in Area of Tribal Conflict |author= |first=Henry |last=Tanner |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0E16FE38541A7A93C7AB1783D85F448685F9 |agency= |newspaper=New York Times |date=25 August 1960 |page=1 |accessdate=2010-11-08 |quote= }}</ref> Like many other African leaders, he supported pan-Africanism and liberation for colonial territories.<ref>{{cite news |title=Lumumba Assails Colonialism as Congo Is Freed |author= |first=Harry |last=Gilroy |url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/world/africa/600701lumumba.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=1 July 1960 |page= |accessdate=2010-11-08 |quote= }}</ref> He proclaimed his regime one of "positive neutralism,"<ref>{{cite news |title=Lumumba Stops In Tunisia |author= |first= |last= |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F1071FF93D581A7A93C6A91783D85F448685F9 |agency= |newspaper=New York Times |date=3 August 1960 |page=3 |accessdate=2010-11-08 |quote='We want no part of the cold war,' he [Lumumba] continued..

===2006 Congolese elections===
Nevertheless, the image of Patrice Lumumba continues to serve as an inspiration in contemporary Congolese politics. In the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006|2006 elections]], several parties claimed to be motivated by his ideas, including the [[People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy]] (PPRD), the political party initiated by the incumbent President [[Joseph Kabila]].<ref name="PPRD">{{cite news | title = Kabila Party formed in DR Congo|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1907252.stm| accessdate= 30 July 2006| date=2 April 2002}}</ref> [[Antoine Gizenga]], who served as Lumumba's Deputy Prime Minister in the post-independence period, was a 2006 Presidential candidate under the Unified Lumumbist Party (Parti Lumumbiste Unifi<U+00E9> (PALU))<ref name="PALU">{{cite news|title=Profile: Congo opposition candidates|publisher=BBC News|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/5199518.stm|accessdate=30 July 2006| date=25 July 2006}}</ref> and was named prime minister at the end of the year. Other political parties that directly utilise his name include the [[Mouvement National Congolais-Lumumba]] (MNC-L) and the Mouvement Lumumbiste (MLP).

===Family and politics===
Patrice Lumumba's family is actively involved in contemporary Congolese politics. Patrice Lumumba was married to Pauline Lumumba and had five children; Fran<U+00E7>ois was the eldest followed by Patrice Junior, Julienne, Roland and [[Guy-Patrice Lumumba]]. Fran<U+00E7>ois was 10 years old when Patrice died. Before his imprisonment, Patrice arranged for his wife and children to move into [[exile]] in [[Egypt]], where Fran<U+00E7>ois spent his childhood, then went to Hungary for education (he holds a doctorate in political economics). He returned to Congo in 1992 to oppose [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Mobutu]] since which time he has been the leader of the Mouvement National Congolais Lumumba (MNC-L), his father's original political party.<ref name="Fran<U+00E7>ois">{{cite web | title = Interview with Fran<U+00E7>ois Lumumba by Andr<U+00E9> Soussan| publisher = African Geopolitics|url = http://www.african-geopolitics.org/show.aspx?ArticleId=3100|accessdate=30 July 2006}}</ref>
