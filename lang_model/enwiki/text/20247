'''BBC Essex''' is the [[BBC Local Radio]] service for the [[England|English]] [[Counties of England|county]] of [[Essex]]. It broadcasts from its studios on New London Road in [[Chelmsford, England|Chelmsford]] on 103.5 ([[Great Braxted]]) and 95.3 ([[South Benfleet]]) [[FM broadcasting|FM]], and on 729 ([[Manningtree]]), 765 (Bakers Wood), and 1530 ([[Rayleigh, Essex|Rayleigh]]) [[AM broadcasting|AM]].  It is also available on [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB]] and live streaming via the internet.

==History==
BBC Essex launched on 5 November 1986.  It broke from the naming convention of "BBC ''Radio'' (county name)" so as to avoid confusion with Essex Radio (later Essex FM, now [[Heart Essex]]). There had also been a pirate station called Radio Essex in the 1960s.

BBC Essex set out to be different from existing BBC local stations, which were often perceived as rather "stuffy" and "worthy". It launched with a more up-beat sound, an almost "tabloid" news style and younger presenters than most stations; the BBC Essex symbol also didn't feature the traditional BBC logo. However, over the years the style has been toned down and the format is now more in line with the rest of the BBC local radio family.

Current presenters include Ray Clark, Dave Monk and Steve Scruton. The station has also seen a number of high profile presenters pass through its doors including Jonathan Overend (BBC Radio 5 Live), Tim 'Timbo' Lloyd (twice winner of Best Local DJ at the Sony Radio Awards) and Mark Pougatch (BBC Sport).  

The station celebrated twenty years of broadcasting in November 2006.

==Transmitters==
The strongest signal is 103.5 FM, which comes from a small transmitter between [[Witham]] and [[Tiptree]]. It reaches into [[Hertfordshire]]. The 95.3FM signal is heard in most of the southern [[Thames Estuary]] as well. The South Benfleet transmitter also provides [[Essex FM]] on 96.3FM and DAB. The 500&nbsp;ft Manningtree transmitter, the highest of all five, also has national radio frequencies, [[Absolute Radio]], [[BBC National DAB]] (the only one in Essex) and [[Digital One]]. It is the main FM transmitter for [[BBC Radio Suffolk|Radio Suffolk]]. The Bakers Wood transmitter also has Essex FM on 102.6FM, and is one of the DAB transmitters. DAB signals, since 20 May 2002, have come from the Essex 12D multiplex, which has transmitters at Maitland House ([[Southend-on-Sea]] town centre), [[Colchester]], [[Sudbury transmitting station|Sudbury]] (in [[Suffolk]]), and Rye Hill (south of [[Harlow]] - on a water tower). Rye Hill also has [[Ten 17]] on 101.7FM.

==Pirate BBC Essex==
From 10 to 17 April 2004, BBC Essex marked the fortieth anniversary of offshore radio in Britain by launching their own ship-based radio station, Pirate BBC Essex. Broadcasting from an old light vessel, the station transmitted sixties music and memories twenty-four hours a day all week. This was followed in August 2007 by another broadcast marking the anniversary of the closing of the pirate stations by the [[Marine Offences Act]].

Over the Easter Weekend in April 2009, the popular ''Pirate Radio Essex'' programme was resurrected by popular demand from listeners,<ref name="bbc.co.uk">http://www.bbc.co.uk/essex/content/articles/2009/02/20/pirate_bbc_essex_feature.shtml</ref> occurring five days after the release of the comedy movie ''[[The Boat that Rocked]]''.<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/> This was broadcast on the AM frequencies, as well as on the Internet, which resulted in many calls from as far away as New Zealand. Presenters included [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]], [[Tony Blackburn]], [[Dave Cash (disc jockey)|Dave Cash]] and Keith Skues as well as the stations presenters: Steve Scruton; Ian Wyatt & Ray Clark.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/essex/local_radio/pirate_bbc_essex/pirate_presenters/index.shtml</ref>
