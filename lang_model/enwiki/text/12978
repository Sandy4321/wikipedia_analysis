The '''Rolex Kentucky Three Day Event''' is an [[eventing]] competition held at the [[Kentucky Horse Park]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. The Rolex Kentucky is a [[Concours Complet International|CCI****]] eventing competition, and the only four-star show in the Western Hemisphere. Four stars is the highest level of competition, the same level of competition as [[Eventing]] at the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The event is sponsored by Rolex watches and is known by many [[equestrians]] simply as Rolex. Prize money of $250,000 is distributed among the top placings with $80,000 as well as a [[Rolex]] watch being awarded to the first place horse and rider.

Competition takes place over four days (Thursday through Sunday), although the event's name says it continues to indicate a three day competition. [[Dressage]] competition is on Thursday and Friday (due to the large number of entries), [[cross country running|cross-country]] is on Saturday, and [[show-jumping]] is on Sunday.

Rolex is held the last weekend of April and is the week before the [[Kentucky Derby]].   

Rolex is one of the three events in the [[Grand Slam of Eventing|Rolex Grand Slam of Eventing]].

==The History of the Rolex Kentucky Three Day Event==
[[Image:R3DE_XCountry.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Rider and horse in Cross Country Course]]
 
In 1974, [[Bruce Davidson (equestrian)|Bruce Davidson]] and the United States Equestrian Team won individual and team gold at the World Championships held in [[Burghley Horse Trials|Burghley, England]]snd Bowers took 2nd place. This gave the United States the right to hold the next World Championships four years later, in 1978. The [[Kentucky Horse Park]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]] was due to open around the same time, and plans were made to hold the World Championships there.

Equestrian Events, Inc. (EEI) was formed to as a non-profit organization to help plan the competition and raise public awareness. The first horse trials at the Kentucky Horse Park was held in 1976, to prepare. In 1977, the National Pony Club Rally and the North American Junior Three-Day Event Championships was also held there.

The 1978 event had more than 170,000 spectators and added more than $4 million to the local economy. The event was broadcast worldwide, as well as nationally on CBS. The success of the World Championships helped to convince the EEU to continue the event annually. Today, the event is broadcast worldwide in 18 languages.

Although the event began as an advanced three-day, and later included open intermediate and preliminary competitions, today it only holds the highest level: the CCI****. Intermediate-level competition was held in 1979 and from 1985-1981. An Advanced-level CCI was held from 1980-1999 up to the *** level, with Advanced Horse Trials (non-CCI) also held from 1992-1996. The CCI**** was begun in 1998, and has been held annually since. Since 2000, the CCI**** is the only competition held during this time, and the preliminary, intermediate, and CCI*** levels are not offered.

Rolex Kentucky had also hoped to continue the [[eventing#Short vs. classic format|classic format]], despite the other major events around the world switching to the short format. Originally, the plan was to alternate years, offering the short format in even-numbered years as preparation for the [[Olympic games]] or the [[World Equestrian Games|World Championship]], while running the classic format in odd-numbered years. However, in 2006 it was announced that, due to lack of funds and interest from upper level riders, the event would only offer the short format. Therefore, all competition run before 2005 (excluding the 2004 Modified division) was run "classic format," and the 2006 event onward will be run in the "short format."

===The CCI****===
The CCI**** competition was first suggested in 1994 by [[Denny Emerson]], who believed [[The United States]] had enough competitors at this high level to warrant the development of a four star. Previously, American riders trained in England when they were preparing for international competition, as the country had the only two annual CCI**** at that time: [[Badminton Horse Trials|Badminton]] and [[Burghley Horse Trials|Burghley]]. The [[USET]] began making plans in 1996, and held the country's first and the world's third annual four-star competition at the [[Kentucky Horse Park]] in 1998.

==Physicality of the Sport==
This sport takes many different precautions concerning the horse<U+2019>s health. Two horses died of a heart attack on the course.<ref>Thomas, Katie. "Equestrians' Deaths Spread Unease in Sports Growing Ranks." New York Times. April 9, 2008.</ref>

Self-efficacy is a way to assess themselves and the horse using a scientific method. Evaluating the health of the horse is important because the horse could easily get injured.<ref>Beauchamp, Mark R. "Self-efficacy and Other-Efficacy in Dyadic Performance: Riding as one in Equestrian Eventing." Journal of Sported and Exercise Psychology. June 2008.</ref>

A study was done to compare the heart rate between a trained and untrained horse. The results show that trained horses do not have more stress or pain in comparison with untrained horses. However, if evaluated 30 minutes before competition, the trained horse would show less stress. According to this experiment the training method, <U+201C>Deep and Round<U+201D>, put more stress on the horse.<ref>van Breda, Eric. "A Nonnatural head-neck Position (Rollkur) during Training Results in Less Acute Stress in Elite, Trained, Dressage horses." Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science. 2006.</ref>
