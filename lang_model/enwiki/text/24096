'''Cricklade''' is a small town in north [[Wiltshire]] in [[England]], on the [[River Thames]], situated midway between [[Swindon]] and [[Cirencester]]. 

Cricklade is twinned with [[Suc<U+00E9>-sur-Erdre]] in France.  Cricklade's [[Latin]] [[motto]] is 'In Loco Delicioso', which means 'in a pleasant place'.<ref name="motto">{{cite web |url=http://www.cricklade-tc.gov.uk/ |title=Criclade town council}}</ref>

In the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]] the [[population]] of the town was 4,132.<ref name="census">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getcensus.php?id=86|title=Cricklade Census Information|accessdate=2006-12-13|publisher=Wiltshire County Council}}</ref>

There is a large clock, known as the [[Jubilee clock]], which was erected in 1898 in honour of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]] the preceding year. It stands outside The Vale Hotel in the High Street, where the Town Cross once stood. There are two replicas of the cross in Cricklade; one is in the churchyard of St Sampson's, the other at St Mary's, and there is local rivalry as to which one is now believed to be the original.

==History==
Cricklade was founded in the 9th century by the [[Anglo Saxons]], and was chosen for the fact that it is where the [[Roman road]] [[Ermin Street]] crosses the River Thames. It was the home of a Saxon royal mint.<ref name="Mint">{{cite web |url=http://www.northwilts-communityweb.com/site/Cricklade-Historical-Society/ |title=Criclade Historical Society}}</ref>


It is one of thirty [[burh]]s (fortresses or fortified towns) mentioned in the [[Burghal Hidage]] document, which describes a system of fortresses and fortified towns built around [[Wessex]] by [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]]. Recent research has suggested that these burhs were built in the short period 878-9 both to defend Wessex against the [[Vikings]] under [[Guthrum]], and to act as an offensive to the Viking presence in [[Mercia]]. It is argued that the completion of this system, of which Cricklade - situated only a little way down Ermin Street from [[Cirencester]], the Viking base for a year - was a key element, precipitated the retreat of the Vikings from Mercia and London to [[East Anglia]], according to the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] in late 879.

The square defences of the fortification were laid out on a regular module. They have been excavated in several places on all four of its sides by a number of [[archaeologist]]s since the 1940s, and is possibly the most extensively sampled fortification of the period. In the initial phase, a walkway of laid stones marked the rear of a bank of stacked turves and clay, which had been derived from the three external ditches.

In the second phase, the front of the bank, which after probably only a short period of time had become somewhat degraded, was replaced by a stone wall. This encircled the defences on all four of its sides. The manpower needed to build this was probably roughly the same as was needed to build the original turf and clay defences. This wall, which would have considerably strengthened the defensive capabilities of the burh, has recently been suggested as having been inserted in the 890s. That other burhs of the Burghal Hidage were also strengthened with stone walls suggests that this was part of a systematic upgrade of the original defensive provision for Wessex which was ordered at this time by the king.

The third phase is marked by the systematic razing of the stone wall, which was pulled down over the inner berm (the space between the wall and the inner ditch). Stones from the wall were used to fill the inner two ditches, which demonstrates that this process was deliberate. A similar phase can be observed in the archaeological record at [[Christchurch, Dorset]], another burh of the Burghal Hidage. Similar observations at other burhs suggests that this phase of destruction of the defences was implemented over the whole of Wessex, and must therefore have been the result of a concerted policy, again by inference on the part of the king. The most reasonable historical context for this seems to be accession of [[King Cnut]] in the early 11th century, in order to prevent the burhs being seized and used against him by his rivals.

The fourth phase is marked by the reuse of the original Anglo Saxon defences by the insertion of a timber palisade along the line of the original wall. This probably marks a phase of the redefence of the town during the [[The Anarchy|civil war]] of 1144 under [[Stephen of England]].

There is little archaeological evidence for the community who were protected by these defences in the Saxon period. There is some indication that streets were laid out in a regular fashion behind the main north-south High Street. This led through a gate in the northern line of the defences to a causeway over the floodplain of the Thames to a bridge over the river, which was probably of a defensive nature.

==Culture==
===Sport===
====Cricklade Fun Run====
Run annually in the first Sunday in October, the Cricklade Fun Run hosts a [[Half marathon]], [[10000 metres|10 km]] and Fun Run event for around 750 runners. This raises funds for a number local charities.<ref>[http://www.crickladefunrun.co.uk/ Cricklade Fun Run]</ref>

====Cricklade Triathlon====
The Cricklade [[Triathlon]] runs in the summer for both adult and Junior forms; for the last few years the events were held on different days. The first to coincide with the Leisure Centres open day, run to say thanks to the town for their support to keep it open. This year it returns to a single day event. <ref>[http://www.crickladetri.net Cricklade Triathlon]</ref>

====Cricklade Leisure Centre====
Towards the end of 2006, the local council (North Wiltshire District Council) tried to close the [[leisure centre]], having calculated a subsidy per visit of <U+00A3>4 for 2007/08. After a very active campaign, the local residents successfully managed to take over the running of the centre and were successful in turning its declining fortunes around. In 2008/09 expenditure was just <U+00A3>86,000 more than income (excluding NWDC Grant), translating into a subsidy per visit of around <U+00A3>1. <ref>[http://www.crickladeleisure.co.uk/ Cricklade Leisure Centre]</ref>

====Cricklade Cricket Club====
Cricklade [[Cricket]] Club has been established for over 100 years, located on the north side of Cricklade the ground (Southam) is sited on the edge of the river Thames. For the 2010 season the club is running 2 Senior Saturday League sides in the Cotswold District Cricket Association (CDCA)

====Cricklade Youth Football Club ====
Cricklade Youth Football Club exists to provide and promote the playing of [[Association Football]] for the youth of Cricklade from U7's to U16's. The club was the first club in Wiltshire to gain the Wiltshire FA Charter Standard - an award for clubs across the country that meet the very high standards required by the FA. We always welcome new players and any adults who wish to help in coaching or managing teams. Further details can be found on the club web site <ref>[http://www.crickladetownfootballclub.co.uk/ Cricklade Youth Football Club]</ref>.

===Nature===
====North Meadow====
Today, the town's main claim to fame is the large nature reserve, [[North Meadow, Cricklade|North Meadow]], which preserves some 80% of Britain's wild [[Fritillaria meleagris|Snake's Head Fritillaries]] in its 150 [[acre]]s (just over 60 [[hectare]]s), which flower in late April to early May. The [[meadow]] is situated between two rivers, the [[Thames]] and the [[River Churn|Churn]], and the unique habitat for the fritillary was created by winter flooding. Such meadows were once common in Britain, but with the advent of modern farming many were drained and ploughed for arable crops from the 1730s onwards. In the case of North Meadow, it escaped such a fate by virtue of the preservation of the [[Court Leet]], the Saxon system of town governance which made sure the land was held in common.

====Blakehill====
In 2000, a disused airfield called Blakehill was bought from the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] to form a second larger meadow of around {{convert|600|acre|ha|abbr=off}}, which was opened to the public in 2005. It rears a small quantity of organic grade beef, usually using rare breeds such as Longhorns.

===Schools===
====Prior Park Preparatory School====
There is an independent school called [[Prior Park Preparatory School]]. The school is a non-selective school and has around 200 pupils aged from 7 to 13 years. It provides both day and boarding places and is home to a number of children from overseas and Forces families. Children are prepared for [[Common Entrance]] and leave at 13 for a variety of independent schools including the school's own senior school, [[Prior Park College]] in Bath. Prior Park is a [[Roman Catholic]] School but has children from all faiths among its pupils. The school has particular strengths in sport, music and art as well as achieving high academic results with a large number of scholarships to senior schools awarded each year.

====St Sampson<U+2019>s C of E School====
There is a state primary school called [[Samson of Dol|St Sampson]]'s [[Church of England]] School, which is linked with the major local landmark, the [[Anglican]] St Sampson's [[parish church]]. It is separated into two parts; the Infant's school, for children aged 4<U+2013>7, and the Junior school, for children aged 7<U+2013>11. Mr Henstridge is the headteacher of the junior school, and Mrs Blundel the headteacher of the infants. But now Mr Henstridge, the headteacher for the junior school, has gone and the deputy, Mrs Bayne, is now the head teacher.

===Churches===
====St Sampson's====<!-- Church of St Sampson, Cricklade redirects here and is in category Grade I listed buildings in Wiltshire -->
Dating back to the 11th century, the church has the third longest [[Bell (instrument)|bellropes]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The present church was built on the remains of another, Saxon church, of 890AD.
The main part of the church was built between 1240 and 1280, though on closer inspection, earlier work can be found. The grand, four spired belltower, the dominating landmark of the town, was built much later, between 1551 and 1553, by the Duke of Northumberland, father in law to [[Lady Jane Grey]].

====St Mary<U+2019>s====
When St Mary's Church of England parish church (The Parish of North Meadow <U+2013> one of the smallest parishes in Britain) was declared redundant by the [[Anglican]] diocese of Bristol, it was leased in January 1984 for use by the local [[Roman Catholic]] community. The building was founded nearly 1,000 years ago and its features include a fine 12th century Chancel Arch and medi<U+00E6>val preaching cross. 
The Friends of St Mary's Cricklade was formed in 1998 to care for the building and a restoration appeal has been launched. A Latin rite mass has been celebrated at various places in Cricklade from about 1939.
====United Methodist Church====
In 1955, a former Baptist church was acquired and re-opened as the Church of St Augustine of Canterbury.

===Town Twinning===
Cricklade has been officially twinned with the French town of [[Suc<U+00E9>-sur-Erdre]] since 1990. In June 2010,  the Twentieth Anniversary was celebrated in Cricklade.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://newsletter.crickladetwinning.org.uk/?Letter=1&Type=2 | publisher = Cricklade and District Twinning Association | title= May 2010 Newsletter | accessdate= 6 July 2010}}</ref>
Suc<U+00E9> is located just north of Nantes in the Loire valley, {{convert|30|mi|km}} from the Atlantic coast. In alternate years Cricklade visit Suc<U+00E9> and the following year Suc<U+00E9> visit Cricklade. Cricklade Twinning Association also hold social events through out the year to raise funds towards hosting the visits by Suc<U+00E9> to Cricklade.

===Saxons Rest===
Cricklade Town Council with help from Cricklade Bloomers built a town garden on a green near Weylands called Saxons Rest which included two large flag poles. This caused controversy as it was built despite public opinion being firmly against it; this included a petition against the construction signed by many Cricklade residents. The Council went ahead with the project and Saxons Rest was completed in [[2009]]. Once completed, public opinion was still firmly against the project claiming that it did not fit with its surroundings. One of the reasons for the opposition was due to its construction being over the remains of a [[castle]] believed to be of [[ Medieval]]  origin.

==Business==
[[Alex Tew]] was a resident of Cricklade at the time of creating [[The Million Dollar Homepage]].

Cricklade Business Association was set up to represent the local business community, the association also has close links to other non-profit making businesses, such as the Rotarians.

Cricklade has many [[public houses]]; the list currently includes The Vale, The Old Bear, The White Hart, The White Lion, The Red Lion, The White Horse Member's Club and the Leisure Centre. 

There is also the local [[museum]] in Calcutt Street run by the Cricklade Historical Society housed in a former Baptist chapel. T.R. Thomson of Costorphine was a long-time resident of Cricklade and a moving spirit behind the establishment of the society. His book, Materials for a History of Cricklade, and various articles have served to preserve and enhance a study of local history in the town.

==Transport==
The [[Thames Path]] runs through Cricklade. It heads downstream on the southern bank, until it reaches [[Eysey Footbridge]], where it crosses to the other side. 

The [[North Wilts Canal]], opened in 1819, passed just to the west of the town. The canal was abandoned in the early twentieth century but parts are now being restored.<ref>[http://www.northwiltscanal.org.uk/ North Wilts Canal]</ref>

[[Cricklade railway station]] was on the [[Midland and South Western Junction Railway]], which linked [[Swindon Town railway station|Swindon]] with [[Cirencester Watermoor railway station|Cirencester]], but this was closed in 1961 and all trace of the station has now gone. Part of the railway route, though, has been opened as a cycle path (national cycle route 45). 

South of the town, however, the Swindon and Cricklade Railway is restoring the line as a leisure facility. As of 2007, passenger trains are being run between [[Blunsdon railway station]] and [[Hayes Knoll]] station, and the line was being actively extended towards Cricklade.

The [[A419]] Swindon to Circencester road by-passes the town to the north-east.
