The '''[[2001 in baseball|2001]] [[National League Division Series]]''' ('''NLDS'''), the opening round of the 2001 [[National League]] playoffs, began on Tuesday, [[October 9]], and ended on Sunday, [[October 14]], with the champions of the three NL divisions &ndash; along with a "wild card" team &ndash; participating in two best-of-five series. The teams were:

*(1) [[Houston Astros]] (Central Division champion, 93-69) vs. (3) [[Atlanta Braves]] (Eastern Division champion, 88-74): Braves win series, 3-0.
*(2) [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] (Western Division champion, 92-70) vs. (4) [[St. Louis Cardinals]] (Wild Card, 93-69): Diamondbacks win series, 3-2.

''The higher seed (in parentheses) had the home field advantage (Games 1, 2 and 5 at home), which was determined by playing record. As both teams had qualified for the postseason, Houston was awarded the Central Division title over St. Louis due to their 9-7 advantage in head-to-head play. Although the team with the best record was normally intended to play the wild card team, the Astros played the Braves, rather than the wild card Cardinals, because the Astros and Cardinals are in the same division.''

The Diamondbacks and Braves went on to meet in the [[2001 National League Championship Series|NL Championship Series]] (NLCS). The Diamondbacks became the National League champion, and defeated the [[2001 American League Championship Series|American League champion]] [[New York Yankees]] in the [[2001 World Series]].

The [[Atlanta Braves]] won their 10th straight division title. The [[Houston Astros]] were in the playoffs for the 7th time, hoping to avenge two postseason losses in the 1990s to the Braves. <br>
In Game 1, [[Greg Maddux]] faced [[Wade Miller]]. [[Brian Jordan]] drove in the first two runs of the game, hitting a sac fly in the first and a solo homer in the 4th. But the Astros would strike back against Maddux. [[Brad Ausmus]]'s two run homer tied the game in the 5th for the Astros. Then [[Moises Alou]]'s groundout in the 6th gave the Astros the lead. But the Braves refused to concede. They struck for 4 runs in the 8th, an inning capped by [[Chipper Jones]]'s dramatic three run homer. Both teams would homer in the 9th but [[John Smoltz]] got the save as the Braves won 7-4. <br>
In Game 2, [[Tom Glavine]] and [[Dave Mlicki]] started a classic pitching duel. In the top of the 2nd, [[B.J. Surhoff]] doubled to lead off the inning. Then [[Andruw Jones]] singled to the shortstop and an error by [[Julio Lugo]] put Surhoff on third. [[Rey Sanchez]] would then ground into a double play by Surhoff would score to make it 1-0 Braves. In all but 2 innings the Astros had a hit and they would strand 5 in the game. Glavine pitched 8 innings and Smoltz recorded his second consecutive postseason save. <br>
In Game 3, [[Shane Reynolds]] faced [[John Burkett]]. In the bottom of the 2nd, [[Paul Bako]]'s two run homer put the Braves up 2-0. In the 3rd, [[Julio Franco]] homered to make it 3-0. Then a squeeze play by Bako in the 4th made it 4-0. Reynolds only lasted 4 innings and Burkett cruised until giving up a two run homer to [[Daryle Ward]] in the 6th. [[Chipper Jones]]'s two run homer provided insurance in the bottom of the 8th and Smoltz once again dominated the ninth. Ausmus flied to center to end the series. Once again, the Astros had been denied by the Braves for their first ever postseason series win. This, to date, is the last postseason series win by the Braves.

The [[St. Louis Cardinals]] were making their second straight postseason appearance and they hoped to avenge their NLCS loss against the [[New York Mets]] in 2000. The [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] were making their second playoff appearance and they too were stunned by the Mets in 1999, having won 100 games that year. <br>
Game 1 was a game of excellent starting pitching. [[Matt Morris]] faced [[Curt Schilling]], who made the most of his first playoff start in 8 years. Both pitchers were on even terms until the bottom of the 5th when Arizona struck first when [[Steve Finley]] singled home [[Damian Miller]]. The game remained 1-0 as Schilling managed to pitch a complete game three hit shutout. <br>
In Game 2, [[Woody Williams]] faced [[Randy Johnson]]. Johnson seemingly had the Cardinals in the 1st when he got [[Placido Polanco]] to ground into a double play. But [[Edgar Renteria]] walked and up came the soon-to-be-named NL Rookie of the Year [[Albert Pujols]]. He then hit his first playoff homerun to make it 2-0 Cardinals in the top of the 1st. Then Polanco's sac fly made it 3-0 in the 3rd. The D'Backs would scratch out a run in the 8th, but an error by [[Miguel Batista]] gave the Cardinals a commanding 4-1 lead in the 9th. [[Steve Kline]] got the save in the bottom of the 9th to even the series. <br>
In Game 3, Batista returned to the mound to start. Opposing him would be [[Darryl Kile]]. Both pitchers worked their way through each inning and kept it scoreless into the 4th. But [[Jim Edmonds]]'s two run homer in the bottom of the 4th gave the Cardinals the lead. But [[Luis Gonzalez]] homered off the right field pole to make it a one run game in the 6th. Then the Diamondbacks would comeback in dramatic fashion. After Kile allowed a leadoff walk in the top of the 7th, [[Mike Matthews]] came on in relief. [[Greg Colbrunn]] would tie the game with an RBI single with one out. A fielder's choice put two men on for eventual NLCS MVP [[Craig Counsell]]. He then hit a three run homerun to right that put the D'Backs ahead by 3. However, Renteria would homer to make it a two run game. But [[Byung-Hyun Kim]] closed the door in the 9th. <br>
[[Albie Lopez]] looked to close the door on the Cards. Opposing him would be [[Bud Smith]]. Smith got into trouble in the top of the 1st when [[Steve Finley]] singled home a run to make it 1-0 Diamondbacks. But [[J.D. Drew]]'s RBI single tied the game in the bottom half of the inning. Then [[Jim Edmonds]] hit the go-ahead homerun in the bottom of the 2nd to put the Cardinals up for good. Then [[Fernando Vina]]'s two run homer in the 3rd gave the Cardinals insurance. Both bullpens held the other team to nothing for the rest of the game as the series was once again tied. <br>
In the clinching Game 5, [[Matt Morris]] once again faced [[Curt Schilling]]. Both pitchers were on their game, allowing only one run throughout the entire game. Morris was the first to falter in the bottom of the 4th when he gave up a solo homerun to [[Reggie Sanders]]. Schilling was masterful and was 4 outs away from winning the series. He was working on a 1-0 4 hit shutout when [[J.D. Drew]] tied the game with a solo homer of his own in the 8th. Schilling pitched a complete game and the D'Backs now had to get him the win. A leadoff double by [[Matt Williams (baseball)|Matt Williams]] gave the D'Backs a good chance. A sac bunt by [[Damian Miller]] put pinch runner [[Midre Cummings]] on third. After Colbrunn was walked intentionally, Cummings tried to steal home on the squeeze play attempt and got caught. Colbrunn went to second and [[Danny Bautista]] came on to pinch run. Then [[Tony Womack]] delivered the series winning single to leftfield. The Diamondbacks won their first postseason series ever and were now going to their first ever NLCS.
