The '''history of the [[Cleveland Browns]]''' [[American football]] team began in 1944  when taxi-cab magnate [[Arthur B. McBride|Arthur B. "Mickey" McBride]] secured a [[Cleveland, Ohio]] franchise in the newly formed [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC). [[Paul Brown]], who coach [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] once called the "father of modern football",{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=v}} was the team's namesake and first coach. From the beginning of play in 1946 at [[Cleveland Municipal Stadium]], the Browns were a great success. Cleveland won each of the AAFC's four championship games before the league dissolved in 1949. The team then moved to the more established [[National Football League]] (NFL), where it continued to dominate. Between 1950 and 1955, Cleveland reached the [[History of National Football League Championship|NFL championship game]] every year, winning three times. 

McBride and his partners sold the team to a group of Cleveland businessmen in 1953 for a then-unheard-of $600,000. Eight years later, the team was sold again, this time to a group led by New York advertising executive [[Art Modell]]. Modell fired Brown before the 1963 season, but the team continued to win behind running back [[Jim Brown]]. The Browns won the [[1964 NFL Championship Game|championship]] in 1964 and reached the [[1965 NFL Championship Game|title game]] the following season, losing to the [[Green Bay Packers]]. The team subsequently reached the playoffs three times in the late 1960s, but fell short of playing in the [[Super Bowl]], the inter-league championship game between the NFL and the rival [[American Football League]] (AFL) that started in 1966.

When the AFL and NFL [[AFL-NFL merger|merged]] before the 1970 season, Cleveland became part of the new [[American Football Conference]] (AFC). While the Browns made it back to the playoffs in 1971 and 1972, they fell into mediocrity through the mid-1970s. A revival of sorts took place in 1979 and 1980, when quarterback [[Brian Sipe]] engineered a series of last-minute wins and the Browns came to be called the "[[Kardiac Kids]]". Under Sipe, however, the Browns did not make it past the first round of the playoffs. Quarterback [[Bernie Kosar]], who the Browns drafted in 1985, led the team to three [[AFC Championship game]]s in the late 1980s but lost each time. In 1995, Modell announced he was relocating the Browns to [[Baltimore]], sowing a mix of outrage and bitterness among Cleveland's dedicated fan base. Negotiations and legal battles led to an agreement where Modell was allowed to move the team, but Cleveland kept the Browns' name, colors and history. After three years of suspension while the old municipal stadium was demolished and [[Cleveland Browns Stadium]] took its place, the Browns started play again in 1999 under new owner [[Al Lerner]]. Since resuming operations, the Browns have made the playoffs only once, as a [[Wild card (sports)#National Football League|wild-card team]] in 2002.

==Founding and dominance in the AAFC (1946<U+2013>1949)==

In 1944 [[Arch Ward]], the influential sports editor of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', proposed a new professional football league called the All-America Football Conference.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=7}} The AAFC was to challenge the dominant National Football League once it began operations at the end of [[World War II]], which had forced many professional teams to curtail activity, merge or go on hiatus as their players served in the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]].{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=8}} It was a bold proposition, given the failure of three previous NFL competitors and the dominance of college football, which was more popular than the professional game at the time.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=6<U+2013>8}} Ward, who had gained fame and respect for starting all-star games for baseball and college football, lined up deep-pocketed owners for the new league's eight teams in hopes of giving it a better chance against the NFL.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=5<U+2013>9}} One of them was Arthur B. "Mickey" McBride, a Cleveland businessman who grew up in Chicago and knew Ward from his involvement in the newspaper business.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=11<U+2013>12}} McBride spent his early career as a circulation manager for the ''[[Cleveland News]]'', and went into business for himself in the 1930s, buying  a pair of Cleveland taxi companies and running a wire service that supplied [[Bookmaker|bookies]] with information about the results of horse races.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=11<U+2013>12}} He had connections to organized crime in Chicago and Cleveland arising from the wire service.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=11<U+2013>12}}{{sfn|Schwarz|2010|p=85}}

McBride developed a passion for football attending games at [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], where his son went to college.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=11}} In the early 1940s he tried to buy the NFL's [[Cleveland Rams]], owned by millionaire supermarket heir [[Dan Reeves (NFL owner)|Dan Reeves]], but was rebuffed.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=11}} Having been awarded the Cleveland franchise in the AAFC, McBride asked ''[[Cleveland Plain Dealer]]'' sportswriter John Dietrich for head coaching suggestions.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=12}} Dietrich recommended Paul Brown, the 36-year-old [[Ohio State Buckeyes]] coach.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=12}} After consulting with Ward, McBride followed Dietrich's advice in early 1945, naming Brown head coach and giving him an ownership stake in the team and full control over player personnel.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=11<U+2013>12}} Brown, who had built an impressive record as coach of a [[Massillon Washington High School|Massillon, Ohio high school]] team and brought the Buckeyes their first national championship, at the time was serving in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and coached the football team at [[Naval Station Great Lakes|Great Lakes Naval Station]] near [[Chicago]].{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=13<U+2013>17}}

The name of the team was at first left up to Brown, who rejected calls for it to be christened the Browns.{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=10}} McBride then held a contest to name the team in May 1945; "Cleveland Panthers" was the most popular choice, but Brown rejected it because it was the name of an [[Cleveland Panthers|earlier failed football team]]. "That old Panthers team failed," Brown said. "I want no part of that name."{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=77}} In August, McBride gave in to popular demand and named the team the Browns, despite Paul Brown's objections.{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=76}}

As the war began to wind down with [[German Instrument of Surrender|Germany's surrender]] in May 1945, the team parlayed Brown's ties to college football and the military to build its roster.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=16<U+2013>18}} The first signing was [[Otto Graham]], a former star quarterback at [[Northwestern University]] who was then serving in the Navy.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=19}} The Browns later signed kicker and offensive tackle [[Lou Groza]] and wide receivers [[Dante Lavelli]] and [[Mac Speedie]].{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=21<U+2013>23}} Fullback [[Marion Motley]] and nose tackle [[Bill Willis]], two of the earliest [[African-American]]s to play professional football, also joined the team in 1946.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=29<U+2013>30}} Cleveland's first training camp took place at [[Bowling Green State University|Bowling Green University]] in northwestern Ohio.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=28}} Brown's reputation for winning notwithstanding, joining the team was a risk; the Browns and the AAFC were nascent entities and faced tough competition from the NFL. "I just went up there to see what would happen," center [[Frank Gatski]] said many years later.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=28}}

[[File:1948 Cleveland Browns football team.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Official portrait of the 1948 Cleveland Browns team|The official team portrait of the 1948 Cleveland Browns, who recorded professional football's first-ever unbeaten and untied season.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=105<U+2013>122}} The squad included seven future members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.]]

Cleveland's first regular-season game took place September 6, 1946 at Cleveland Municipal Stadium against the [[Miami Seahawks]] before a then-record crowd of 60,135.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=45<U+2013>46}} That contest, which the Browns won 44<U+2013>0, kicked off an era of dominance. With Brown at the helm, the team won all four of the AAFC's championships from 1946 until its dissolution in 1949, amassing a record of 52 wins, four losses and three ties.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=123<U+2013>150}} This included the 1948 season, in which the Browns became the first unbeaten and untied team in professional football history.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=105<U+2013>186}} The Browns had few worthy rivals among the AAFC's eight teams, but the [[New York Yankees (AAFC)|New York Yankees]] and [[San Francisco 49ers]] were their closest competition.{{sfn|Maxymuk|2007|p=102}}

While the Browns excelled on defense, Cleveland's winning ways were driven by an offense that employed Brown's version of the [[T formation]], which emphasized speed, timing and execution over set plays.{{sfn|Maxymuk|2007|p=102}} Brown liked his players "lean and hungry," and championed quickness over bulk.{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=45}} Graham became a star under Brown's system, leading all passers in each of the AAFC's seasons and racking up 10,085 passing yards.{{sfn|Maxymuk|2007|p=103}} Motley, who Brown in 1948 called "the greatest fullback that ever lived",<ref name="Brown says 1948 team best yet">{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Harry|title=Brown Calls His First Unbeaten and Untied Team Since '40 His Best Yet|accessdate=May 11, 2012|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=December 20, 1948|page=23|quote=[Brown said:] 'How that boy can run I think he's the greatest fullback that ever lived&nbsp;...

The Cleveland area showered support on the Browns from the outset.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=13<U+2013>16}} Meanwhile, the Browns unexpectedly had Cleveland to themselves; the NFL's Cleveland Rams, who had continually lost money despite winning the [[1945 NFL Championship Game|1945 NFL championship]], moved to [[Los Angeles]] after that season.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=14}} The Browns' on-field feats only amplified their popularity, and the team saw average attendance of 57,000 per game in its first season.{{sfn|Neft|1994|p=194}} The Browns, however, became victims of their own success. Cleveland's dominance exposed a lack of balance among AAFC teams, which the league tried to correct by sending Browns players including quarterback [[Y.A. Tittle]] to the [[Baltimore Colts (1947<U+2013>1950)|Baltimore Colts]] in 1948.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=108<U+2013>109}} Attendance at Browns games fell in later years as fans lost interest in lopsided victories, while attendance for less successful teams fell even more precipitously.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=137<U+2013>138}} The Browns led all of football during the undefeated season in 1948 with an average crowd of 45,517, but that was more than 10,000 less than the average per game the previous year.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=119}} These factors <U+2013> combined with a war for players between the two leagues that raised salaries and ate into owners' profits <U+2013> ultimately led to the dissolution of the AAFC and the merger of three of its teams, including the Browns, into the NFL in 1949.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=123<U+2013>150}} The NFL does not acknowledge AAFC statistics and records because these achievements <U+2013> including the Browns' perfect season <U+2013> did not take place in the NFL or against NFL teams, and not in a league fully absorbed by the NFL.<ref name="AAFC records unrecognized">{{cite web|last=Grossi|first=Tony|title=1948 Cleveland Browns still lacking NFL respect|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/sports/2008/02/1948_cleveland_browns_still_la.html|publisher=cleveland.com|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68UNk95vf|archivedate=June 17, 2012|accessdate=May 11, 2012|date=15|month=February|year=2008|quote=NFL Vice President Joe Browne stated that going undefeated and untied was 'a sterling achievement,' but 'it was not achieved in the NFL nor against NFL teams, nor in a league which became in its entirety part of the NFL.'

The AAFC proposed match-ups with NFL teams numerous times during its four-year existence, but no inter-league game ever materialized.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=10<U+2013>11}} That made Cleveland's entry into the NFL in the 1950 season the first test of whether its early supremacy could carry over into a more established league.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=160<U+2013>165}} The proof came quickly: Cleveland's NFL regular-season opener was against the two-time defending champion [[Philadelphia Eagles]] on September 16 in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=163}} The Browns quashed any doubt about their prowess in that game as Graham and his receivers amassed 246 passing yards in a 35<U+2013>10 win before a crowd of 71,237.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=163<U+2013>166}} Behind an offense that featured Graham, Groza, Motley, Lavelli and running back [[Dub Jones (American football)|Dub Jones]], Cleveland finished the 1950 season with a 10<U+2013>2 record, tied for first place in the eastern conference.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=151<U+2013>176}} After winning a playoff game against the [[New York Giants]], the Browns advanced to the [[1950 NFL Championship Game|NFL championship match]] against the [[History of the Los Angeles Rams|Los Angeles Rams]] in Cleveland.

After five straight championship wins in the AAFC and NFL, the Browns appeared poised to bring another trophy home in 1951. The team finished the regular season with 11 wins and a single loss in the first game of the season.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=223<U+2013>230}} Cleveland faced the Rams on December 23 in a [[NFL Championship Game, 1951|rematch]] of the previous year's title game.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=231}} The score was deadlocked 17<U+2013>17 in the final period, but a 73-yard touchdown pass by Rams quarterback [[Norm van Brocklin]] to wide receiver [[Tom Fears]] broke the tie and gave Los Angeles the lead for good. The 24<U+2013>17 loss was the Browns' first in a championship game.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=231<U+2013>235}}

The 1952 and 1953 seasons followed a similar pattern: Cleveland reached the championship game but lost both times to the [[Detroit Lions]].{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=237<U+2013>286}} In 1952's [[1952 NFL Championship Game|championship game]], Detroit won 17<U+2013>7 after a [[muffed punt]] by the Browns, several Lions defensive stands and a 67-yard touchdown run by [[Doak Walker]] scuttled Cleveland's chances.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=237<U+2013>254}} The team finished 11<U+2013>1 in 1953, but lost the [[1953 NFL Championship Game|championship]] to the Lions 17<U+2013>16 on a 33-yard [[Bobby Layne]] touchdown pass to [[Jim Doran]] with just over two minutes left.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=263<U+2013>286}} While the championship losses disappointed Cleveland fans who had grown accustomed to winning, the team continued to make progress. [[Len Ford]], who the Browns picked up from the defunct AAFC's [[Los Angeles Dons]] team, emerged as a force on the defensive line, making the [[Pro Bowl]] each year between 1951 and 1953.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=153<U+2013>154}} Second-year wideout [[Ray Renfro]] became a star in 1953, also reaching the Pro Bowl.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=237<U+2013>272}}

During the summer before the 1953 season, the Browns' original owners sold the team for a then-unheard-of $600,000.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=264}} The buyers were a group of prominent Cleveland men: Dave R.

While the Browns came into 1954 as one of the top teams in the NFL, the future was far from certain. Graham, whose leadership and throwing skills were instrumental in the Browns' championship runs, said he planned to retire after the season.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=310}} Motley, the team's best rusher and blocker, retired at the beginning of the season with a bad knee.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=306}} Star [[defensive lineman]] Bill Willis also retired before the season.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=306}} Still, Cleveland finished the regular season 9<U+2013>3{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=305<U+2013>326}} and met Detroit the day after Christmas in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1954|championship game]] for a third consecutive time.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=317<U+2013>326}} This time Cleveland dominated on both sides of the ball, intercepting Bobby Layne six times while Graham threw three touchdowns and ran for three more.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=317<U+2013>326}} The Browns, who lost the last game of the regular season to the Lions only a week before, won their second NFL championship 56<U+2013>10.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|pp=317<U+2013>326}} "I saw it, but still hardly can believe it," Lions coach [[Buddy Parker]] said after the game.

A conflict took shape between Paul Brown and Jim Brown; emboldened by his success, the fullback began to question his coach's disciplinarian methods. He called the coach "Little Caesar" behind his back. At halftime during a game in 1959, Paul Brown questioned the severity of an injury Jim Brown was sidelined for, which further inflamed tensions between the two.{{sfn|Dyer|2007|p=114}}

===Art Modell takes ownership===

[[Fred "Curly" Morrison]], a former Browns running back who worked as an advertising executive for [[CBS]] television, learned in 1960 that Dave Jones was looking to sell the Browns and told the story to [[Art Modell]], a 35-year-old advertising and television executive from [[Brooklyn]].{{sfn|Coughlin|2011|p=212<U+2013>213}} Modell was intrigued, partly because of the potentially lucrative television rights that one of the NFL's most successful franchises could bring as football began to challenge baseball as America's biggest sport.{{sfn|Coughlin|2011|pp=213<U+2013>214}} Having borrowed as much money as he could, Modell completed the purchase in March 1961 for $3.925 million. Bob Gries, who had a share in the Browns from the beginning, agreed to buy in again at the new valuation and take a stake of almost 40%, defraying Modell's costs substantially.{{sfn|Coughlin|2011|p=214}} As the previous owners did when they took over, Modell quickly assured Cleveland fans that Brown would "have a free hand" in running the organization and awarded him a new eight-year contract.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=37}} "As far as I'm concerned Paul Brown can send [plays] in by carrier pigeon," Modell said. "In my opinion he has no peer as a football coach. His record speaks for itself. I view our relationship as a working partnership."{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=43}}

The 1961 season was typical on the field: Jim Brown led the league in rushing for the fifth straight season and the team ended with an 8<U+2013>5<U+2013>1 record. That left Cleveland two games out of a berth in the championship.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=50}} During that year, however, players began to question Paul Brown's strict and often overbearing demeanor, while many challenged his control over the team's strategy. Milt Plum spoke out against Brown calling all the team's offensive plays, and Jim Brown said on a weekly radio broadcast that the coach's play-calling and handling of Plum were undermining the quarterback's confidence.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=48}}{{sfn|Lebovitz|2006|p=15}} They found a willing listener in Modell, a bachelor who was closer to their age than the coach's.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=43, 47}}

Further cracks appeared in the "working partnership" between Paul Brown and Modell before the 1962 season. Brown made a trade without informing Modell, giving up star halfback [[Bobby Mitchell]] to acquire the rights to Syracuse running back [[Ernie Davis]], the first African-American to win the [[Heisman Trophy]].{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=50}} Davis was chosen by the [[Washington Redskins]] with the first overall pick in the 1962 draft, but while Davis was the first black player ever selected by Washington, team owner [[George Preston Marshall]] made the move only after being given an ultimatum to add an African-American player or risk losing his stadium lease. Davis demanded a trade, leaving the door open to the Browns, who signed him to a three-year contract worth $80,000.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=51}} As Davis was preparing for the [[College All-Star Game]], however, he came down with a mystery illness and was later diagnosed with [[leukemia]]. Brown ruled Davis out for the season, but the running back returned to Cleveland and began a conditioning program after one of his doctors said playing football would not exacerbate his condition.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=52}} Modell thought Davis could be prepared to play, and Davis, who by then knew he was dying, wanted to be part of the team. Brown, however, continued to insist that he sit out, driving a deeper wedge between him and Modell. Davis died the following May.{{sfn|Lebovitz|2006|pp=15<U+2013>16}}

The rift between Brown and Modell only widened as the 1962 season progressed. [[Frank Ryan (American football)|Frank Ryan]] took Milt Plum's place as the team's starting quarterback by the end of the season, and the Browns finished with a 7<U+2013>6<U+2013>1 record. Jim Brown was not the NFL's leading rusher for the only time in his career.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=57}}

===Paul Brown is fired===

On January 9, 1963, Art Modell sent a statement to the newswires: "Paul E. Brown, head coach and general manager, will no longer serve the team in those capacities," it said.<ref name="Paul Brown fired">{{cite news|last=Friedman|first=Larry|title=Paul Brown Fired After 17 Years With Browns|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1908&dat=19630111&id=jmEfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ldQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3133,483230|accessdate=May 18, 2012|newspaper=Nevada Daily Mail|date=January 10, 1963|agency=Associated Press|page=8}}</ref> Immediate reaction to the decision was muted due to a newspaper strike that kept the [[Cleveland Plain Dealer]] and [[Cleveland Press]] off the newsstands until April. A printing company executive, however, got together a group of sportswriters and published a 32-page magazine fielding players' views on the firing. Opinions were mixed; Modell came in for his share of criticism, but tackle and team captain [[Mike McCormack (American football)|Mike McCormack]] said he did not think the team could win under Brown.{{sfn|Lebovitz|2006|p=13<U+2013>14}} Nonetheless, it was a shocking end to the 17-year Cleveland career of a coach who was already a seminal figure in the city's sports history.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=62<U+2013>63}} Among many innovations, Brown was the first coach to call plays for his quarterback, give players IQ and personality tests and use game film to evaluate opponents.{{sfn|Cantor|2008|p=3}} Even Jim Brown lauded his pioneering role in integrating the game:

<blockquote>Paul Brown integrated pro football without uttering a single word about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it.&nbsp;... [I]n his own way, the man integrated football the right way <U+2013> and no one was going to stop him.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=49}}</blockquote>

Modell named Brown's chief assistant, [[Blanton Collier]], as the team's new head coach.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=64}} Collier was a friendly, studious man who became a player favorite as an assistant on both offense and defense under Brown.{{sfn|Groza|2003|p=52}} He installed an open offense and allowed Ryan to call his own plays.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=67}} In Collier's first season, the Browns finished with a 10<U+2013>4 record but fell short of a division title.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=75, 77}} Jim Brown won the [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|MVP award]] in 1963 with a record 1,863&nbsp;yards rushing. Dominant blocking from the Browns' offensive line, which included guard [[Gene Hickerson]] and left tackle [[Dick Schafrath]], helped boost his totals.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=74, 78}}

===1964 championship===

[[File:Cleveland Browns quarterback Frank Ryan, 1964.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Cleveland quarterback Frank Ryan is mobbed after the 1964 championship.]]

Cleveland climbed back to the top of the eastern division in 1964 with a 10<U+2013>3<U+2013>1 record behind Jim Brown's league-leading 1,446&nbsp;yards of rushing.<ref name="1964 statistics">{{cite web|title=1964 Cleveland Browns Statistics & Players|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cle/1964.htm|publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68UXIe1c9|archivedate=June 17, 2012|accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref> Rookie wide receiver [[Paul Warfield]] led the team with 52 catches,{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=112, 198}} and Frank Ryan cemented his place as the team's starting quarterback, recording the best game of his career in the season closer against the New York Giants, a game the Browns needed to win to advance to the championship.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=118<U+2013>119}} Yet despite Cleveland's prowess, the Browns went into the [[NFL Championship Game, 1964|championship game]] as heavy underdogs against the Baltimore Colts. Most sportswriters predicted an easy win for the Colts, who led the league in scoring behind quarterback [[Johnny Unitas]] and halfback [[Lenny Moore]]. The Browns' defense, moreover, was suspect. The team gave up 20 more first downs than any other in the league.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=122<U+2013>124}} The teams, however, had not faced each other for three years. Before the game, Collier and Colts coach [[Don Shula]] agreed to give each other full access to video of regular-season games. Ever the student, Collier took full advantage of the opportunity. The Browns had run what was dubbed a "rubber band" pass defense, allowing short throws while trying to prevent big plays. The Colts' top receivers, however, [[Raymond Berry]] and [[Jimmy Orr]], were not fast. They tended to pick apart defenses with short, tactical completions, which led Collier to institute a man-to-man pass defense for the game. This, he figured, would buy more time for the defensive line and force Unitas to scramble <U+2014> not his forte.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=131<U+2013>132}}

The strategy paid off, and in the wind-whipped Cleveland Municipal Stadium two days after [[Christmas]], the Browns beat the Colts 27<U+2013>0. Neither team scored in the first half, prompting ''[[New York Times]]'' columnist [[Red Smith (sportswriter)|Red Smith]] to quip, "Never have so many paid so dearly <U+2013> $10, $8, and $6 <U+2013> and suffered so sorely to see so little."{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=148}} In the second half, the Browns' defense held on and the offense kicked into gear. Baltimore's cornerbacks were double-teaming Warfield, which Ryan exploited by throwing three touchdowns to his second wideout, [[Gary Collins (American football)|Gary Collins]]. The Browns scored 10 points in the third quarter and a further 17 in the fourth, clinching the first title since Otto Graham's departure after the 1955 season.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=150<U+2013>151}} Collins was named the game's MVP.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=158}}

The following year was a strong one as Jim Brown gritted out another league-leading rushing season.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=178}} The Browns ended with an 11<U+2013>3 record and comfortably won the eastern division.<ref name="1965 statistics">{{cite web|title=1965 Cleveland Browns Statistics & Players|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cle/1965.htm|publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68UXOrD2U|archivedate=June 17, 2012|accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref> That set up a second straight appearance in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1965|NFL Championship game]] against the Packers on a slippery, mucky [[Lambeau Field]] on January 2, 1966.

==Playoff disappointments (1966<U+2013>1973)==

In early 1966 Jim Brown, who had began an acting career two years before, was shooting for his second film in London.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=176<U+2013>178}} ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' cast Brown as Robert Jefferson, a convict sent to France during World War II to assassinate German officers meeting at a castle near [[Rennes]] in [[Brittany]]. Production delays due to bad weather meant he would miss at least the first part of training camp on the campus of [[Hiram College]], which annoyed Modell, who threatened to fine Brown $1,500 for every week of camp he missed.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=178<U+2013>179}} Brown, who had previously said that 1966 would be his last season, announced his retirement instead.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=179}} At the end of his nine-year career, Brown held records for most rushing yards in a game, a season and a career.

With Brown gone, halfback [[Leroy Kelly]] became the team's primary rusher in 1966. Kelly, an eighth-round draft choice who saw limited playing time in two years as a backup, ably filled his predecessor's shoes.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|pp=272<U+2013>276}} Cleveland missed the playoffs in 1966, but made it to the postseason the following year after a realignment of the NFL's divisions that placed the Browns in the new [[Century Division]].{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=50}} The Browns, however, lost the 1967 eastern conference championship to the [[Dallas Cowboys]].{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=50}} After a year in which he made just 11 of 23 field goal attempts, placekicker Lou Groza retired before the start of the 1968 season.{{sfn|Pluto|1997|p=190}} Groza, who had been on the roster for 21 seasons and was 44 years old when he hung up his spikes, said in his memoir that retiring was "the saddest day of my football life."{{sfn|Groza|2003|p=100}}

===Kardiac Kids===

[[File:Sipe1979bySherk.jpeg|thumb|right|Cleveland Browns quarterback Brian Sipe led the "Kardiac Kids" to a series of last-minute victories.]]

Rutigliano was a gambler: he tinkered with offenses, took chances on trick plays and was not afraid to break with the play-calling conventions of his time.{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=12<U+2013>13}} The coach, who earned the nickname "Riverboat Sam" for his risk-taking approach, once said that security was "for cowards". "I believe in gambling," he said. "No successful man ever got anywhere without gambling."{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=13}} This seat-of-your-pants philosophy began to manifest itself on the field in 1979. The campaign started with a nail-biter against the New York Jets that the Browns won in overtime on a Cockroft field goal as time expired. "If we continue to play 'em that way all year, I'll be gone before the 10th game because my heart just won't take it," Rutigliano said after the game.<ref name="Browns beat Jets in OT, 1979">{{cite news|last=Heaton|first=Chuck|title=Browns stun Jets in OT|url=http://www.cleveland.com/brownshistory/plaindealer/index.ssf?/browns/more/history/19790902BROWNS.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68Ub4u7Cx|archivedate=June 17, 2012|accessdate=May 25, 2012|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=September 2, 1979}}</ref> In the second week, Cleveland beat the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] 27<U+2013>24 on a Sipe touchdown to Rucker with 52 seconds left.{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=74}} The third game was an equally improbable 13<U+2013>10 win against the Baltimore Colts.{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=74}} ''Cleveland Plain Dealer'' sports editor [[Hal Lebovitz]] wrote after the game that these "[[Kardiac Kids]]" were lucky to have pulled off the win after Colts kicker [[Toni Linhart]] missed three field goals.<ref name="Lebovitz on Kardiac Kids">{{cite news|last=Lebovitz|first=Hal|title=Gift from Colts|accessdate=May 25, 2012|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=September 17, 1979|page=1<U+2013>C}}</ref>

After a string of four wins and three losses, the late-game heroics returned in an overtime victory on November 18 against the Miami Dolphins.{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=13}} "You should never pipe Browns games into an intensive care unit, expose them to anyone weak of pulse," wrote [[Toledo Blade]] columnist Jim Taylor.

===Red Right 88===

{{Main|Red Right 88}}

That was good for first place in the AFC Central and a trip to the postseason for the first time since 1972.{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=76}} The playoffs began against the [[Oakland Raiders]] on January 4, 1981 in a bitterly cold Cleveland Municipal Stadium.{{sfn|Knight|2003|pp=234<U+2013>236}} The game started slowly: each team scored only a touchdown in the first half, although Cockroft missed Cleveland's extra point because of a bad snap.{{sfn|Knight|2003|pp=238<U+2013>242}} In the third quarter, Cleveland went ahead 12<U+2013>7 on a pair of Cockroft field goals, but the Raiders came back in the final period, driving 80&nbsp;yards down the field for a touchdown. That put Oakland ahead 14<U+2013>12.{{sfn|Knight|2003|pp=243<U+2013>245}} The ball changed hands five times with no scoring from either side, and with 2:22 on the clock, Cleveland had a final shot to win the game.{{sfn|Knight|2003|pp=246<U+2013>247}} Sipe and the offense took over at the Browns' 15-yard line. In eight plays, Cleveland drove down to Oakland's 14, leaving 56 seconds on the clock.{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=250}}

[[File:Sam-Rutigliano-1979.jpg|thumb|left|Sam Rutigliano, the Browns' head coach during the Kardiac Kids years]]

After a one-yard [[Mike Pruitt]] run, Rutigliano called a timeout.{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=250}} A short field goal would have been the safe bet <U+2014> that was all Cleveland needed to win. Rutigliano, ever the risk-taker, decided to go for a touchdown. The coach was reluctant to stake the game's outcome on the usually sure-footed Cockroft, who had missed two field goals and an extra point earlier in the game.{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=250}} The play he called was [[Red Right 88]], a passing formation in which a slanting Logan would be Sipe's primary target, while Newsome was insurance. If everyone was covered, Rutigliano told Sipe on the sidelines, "if you feel you have to force the ball, throw it into Lake Erie, throw it into some blonde's lap in the bleachers."{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=251}} Sipe took the snap, dropped back and threw to Newsome as he crossed to the left. But Oakland safety [[Mike Davis (American football)|Mike Davis]] leaped in front and intercepted the ball, cementing the Oakland win. The Raiders went on to win [[Super Bowl XIV]], while Red Right 88 became an enduring symbol of Cleveland's postseason stumbles.{{sfn|Knight|2003|pp=252<U+2013>254, 261, 265}}

Despite 1980's playoff defeat, the Browns were widely expected to be even better the following year. But 1981 came with none of the comebacks or late-game magic the Kardiac Kids were known for. Several games were close, but most were losses. Sipe threw only 17 touchdowns and was intercepted 25 times.{{sfn|Knight|2003|pp=269<U+2013>270}} The team finished 5<U+2013>11.{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=272}} The [[1982 NFL strike]], which began in September and lasted until mid-November, shortened the regular season the following year to nine games.{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=276}} Coming off a poor year, Sipe split starts with his backup, [[Paul McDonald (American football)|Paul McDonald]], and neither was able to bring back the old Kardiac Kids spark.{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=276}} The team ended with a 4<U+2013>5 record, which qualified for an expanded Super Bowl playoff tournament created to accommodate the shorter season. The Browns faced the Raiders in a rematch of 1980's playoff thriller. This time, though, McDonald was the starter and the ending was far from tense. The Raiders won 27<U+2013>10.{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=276}}

The following two years brought the Sipe era and the short-lived success of the Kardiac Kids to an end.{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=277}} Sipe returned to form in 1983, and the team narrowly missed a spot in the playoffs after a loss to the Houston Oilers in the second-to-last game of the regular season.{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=78}} Sipe signed before the end of the season to play for the [[New Jersey Generals]], a team owned by real estate mogul [[Donald Trump]] in the upstart [[United States Football League]].{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=277}}

In training camp before the 1984 season, cornerback [[Hanford Dixon]] tried to motivate the team's defensive linemen by barking at them between plays in practice and calling them "the Dogs". "You need guys who play like dogs up front, like dogs chasing a cat," Dixon said.{{sfn|Knight|2006|p=26}} The media picked up on the name, which gained traction in part because of the improvement of the Browns' defense during the regular season. Fans put on face paint and dog masks, and the phenomenon coalesced in rowdy fans in Cleveland Stadium's cheap bleachers section close to the field.{{sfn|Knight|2006|p=26}} The [[Dawg Pound]], as the section was eventually nicknamed, is a continuing symbol of Cleveland's dedicated fan base.{{sfn|Boyer|2006|pp=101<U+2013>105}}

Despite the defensive improvement, Sipe's departure left Cleveland's offense in disarray in 1984. Browns began the season 1<U+2013>7 with McDonald at quarterback, and fans' frustration with the team and Rutigliano boiled over.{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=78}} The breaking point came in an October 7 game against the [[New England Patriots]] that bore an eerie resemblance to Cleveland's 1980 playoff loss to the Raiders. The Browns were down 17<U+2013>16 in the fourth quarter, and lost on an interception in New England's end zone as time expired.{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=278}} Chants of "Goodbye Sam" rung out from the stands after the New England game.

==Bernie Kosar years, The Drive and The Fumble (1985<U+2013>1990)==

The selection of [[University of Miami]] quarterback [[Bernie Kosar]] in 1985's [[supplemental draft]] ushered in a new, largely successful era for Cleveland. With Schottenheimer, Kosar and a cast of talented players on offense and defense, the team reached greater heights than Rutigliano and Sipe ever did. Though they became consistent playoff contenders in this era, the Browns did not reach the Super Bowl, falling one win short three times in the late 1980s.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=299<U+2013>300}}

Kosar, who wanted to play for Cleveland because his family lived in a suburb of nearby [[Youngstown, Ohio]], signed a five-year contract worth nearly $6 million in 1985 and was immediately embraced by the Browns organization and the team's fans.{{sfn|Knight|2006|p=16, 21}} "It's not an everyday occurrence that somebody ''wants'' to play in Cleveland," Modell said.

While not stellar, the Browns' record won first place in a weak AFC Central, and the team looked poised to shock the heavily favored Miami Dolphins in a divisional playoff game on January 4, 1986.{{sfn|Knight|2006|p=56}} Cleveland surged to a 21<U+2013>3 halftime lead, and it took a spirited second-half comeback by [[Dan Marino]] and the Dolphins to win it 24<U+2013>21 and end the Browns' season.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=58<U+2013>62}} Despite the loss, many people expected Cleveland to be back the following year. "The Browns' days, the good days, are here and ahead of us," radio personality Pete Franklin said.{{sfn|Knight|2006|p=62}}

The following year marked Cleveland's entry into the ranks of the NFL's elite as Kosar's play improved and the defensive unit came together. Kosar threw for 3,854&nbsp;yards to a corps of receivers that included [[Brian Brennan]], Newsome and rookie [[Webster Slaughter]].{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=93, 95, 98}} On defense, cornerbacks [[Frank Minnifield]] and Hanford Dixon emerged as one of the NFL's premiere pass-defending duos.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=28<U+2013>29}} After a slow start, the Browns rose to the top of the divisional standings, twice beating the Pittsburgh Steelers and ending a 16-game losing streak at [[Three Rivers Stadium]].{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=73, 79, 93}} A 12<U+2013>4 record earned Cleveland home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=89}}

The Browns' first opponents in the 1986 playoffs were the New York Jets.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=97<U+2013>98}} The Jets were ahead for most of the game and held a 20<U+2013>10 lead as time wound down in the final quarter. But Cleveland took over and began a march down the field, ending with a Kevin Mack touchdown.{{sfn|Knight|2006|p=100<U+2013>103}} The defense forced the Jets to punt after the ensuing kickoff, leaving the offense with less than a minute to get within field goal range and even the score at 20<U+2013>20. A pass interference penalty and a completion to Slaughter put the ball at the Jets' five-yard line, and kicker [[Mark Moseley]] booted through the tying score with 11 seconds left.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=103<U+2013>105}} In an initial 15-minute overtime period, Moseley missed a short field goal and neither team scored, sending the game into double overtime.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=106<U+2013>108}} This time, Moseley made a field goal and won the game for the Browns 23<U+2013>20. It was the team's first playoff victory in 18 years.{{sfn|Knight|2006|p=109}}

===The Drive===

{{Main|The Drive}}

The following week, the Browns matched up against the [[Denver Broncos]] in the AFC Championship game in Cleveland.{{sfn|Knight|2006|p=116}} Denver got out to an early lead, but Cleveland tied the game and then went ahead 20<U+2013>13 in the fourth quarter.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=116, 118<U+2013>119}} After the ensuing kickoff, the Broncos were pinned at their own two-yard line with 5:34 remaining.

Cleveland received the ball first in the sudden-death period but was stopped by the Denver defense. On Denver's first possession, Elway again led the Broncos on a long drive ending with a [[Rich Karlis]] field goal that sailed just inside the right upright and won the game.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=128<U+2013>130}} The drive that tied the game has since come to be seen as one of the best in playoff history, and is remembered by Cleveland fans as an historic meltdown.

===The Fumble===

{{Main|The Fumble}}

The win set up a rematch with the Broncos in the AFC Championship in Denver.{{sfn|Knight|2006|p=169}} The Broncos held a 21<U+2013>3 lead at halftime, but a pair of rushing touchdowns and another by receiver [[Reggie Langhorne]] brought Cleveland to within seven points.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=173<U+2013>177}} Cleveland scored again in the fourth quarter, but the Broncos went ahead again by seven points on a touchdown with four minutes left.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=178<U+2013>179}} After Denver's kickoff, Kosar and the offense reached the Brocos' eight-yard line with 1:12 remaining.{{sfn|Knight|2006|p=180}} Kosar handed the ball to Earnest Byner on a second down. Byner ran left and broke inside with a clear path to the end zone, but was stripped by Denver's [[Jeremiah Castille]] just before crossing the goal line. The Broncos ran down the clock before intentionally taking a [[Safety (American and Canadian football score)|safety]] and winning 38<U+2013>33.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=181<U+2013>183}} "[[The Fumble]]" quickly entered the lexicon of the Browns' modern-era disappointment, just as The Drive had a year before.{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=92}}

The 1988 season was marred by injuries to the Browns' quarterbacks.

==Bill Belichick and Modell's move (1991<U+2013>1995)==
===Belichick era===

Belichick, who came to the Browns after 12 years mostly with the Giants under [[Bill Parcells]], quickly made his mark by restricting media access to the team. He acted gruff or bored at press conferences, shrugging, rolling his eyes and often giving short answers to long questions.{{sfn|Holley|2011|p=1}} This bred the perception that the new coach was not a good communicator and lacked a vision for the team. Behind the scenes, however, he was trying to remake the Browns. He reformed Cleveland's scouting methods and, in conjunction with player personnel director [[Michael Lombardi (sportscaster)|Mike Lombardi]], tried to form a coherent identity: a big and strong cold-weather team.{{sfn|Holley|2011|pp=1<U+2013>2}} Belichick's new way forward, however, did not immediately translate to on-field success. Cleveland's record only improved slightly in 1991 to 6<U+2013>10 as the offense struggled to produce scoring drives and the defense was plagued by injuries.{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=101}} Kosar was a rare bright spot, passing for almost 3,500&nbsp;yards and 18 touchdowns.{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=101}} Bridging the end of the 1990 season and the beginning of 1991, the quarterback threw a then-record 307 straight passes without an interception.{{sfn|Gordon|2002|p=84}} Kosar broke his ankle twice and sat out for most of the 1992 season, leaving quarterback [[Mike Tomczak]] under center. The team finished with a 7<U+2013>9 record and did not make the playoffs.{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=101}}

By the end of 1992, Kosar's physical decline had long been apparent to Belichick, which left the coach with a difficult choice.{{sfn|Holley|2011|pp=7<U+2013>8}} Kosar was Cleveland's most popular athlete, a hometown boy who had forgone big money and a bigger profile to lead a struggling team back to the top.{{sfn|Holley|2011|pp=7<U+2013>8}} While he recognized it would be an unpopular decision, Belichick wanted to bench Kosar, and in 1992 the team picked up a potential replacement in [[Vinny Testaverde]] from the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].{{sfn|Holley|2011|pp=8<U+2013>9}} Belichick named Kosar the starter before the 1993 season,{{sfn|Holley|2011|p=13}} but in the third game against the Raiders, Belichick pulled Kosar after he threw his third interception of the night. Taking over with Los Angeles ahead 13<U+2013>0, Testaverde led two touchdown drives to win the game. Two weeks later, Belichick named Testaverde the starter. On the verge of tears after a loss to the Dolphins, Kosar said he was disappointed with the decision and felt he had done what he could with what was at his disposal.<ref name="Testaverde named starter">{{cite news|last=Cabot|first=Mary Kay|title=The Job is Testaverde's|url=http://www.cleveland.com/brownshistory/plaindealer/index.ssf?/browns/more/history/19931010BROWNS.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68UlYco7d|archivedate=June 17, 2012|accessdate=May 28, 2012|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=October 10, 1993}}</ref>

===Modell's Move===

{{Main|Cleveland Browns relocation controversy}}

[[File:Browns Old.JPG|thumb|right|Browns owner Art Modell's 25-year lease of Cleveland Municipal Stadium planted the seed of financial troubles that culminated in his decision to relocate the team in 1995.]]

As the Browns recaptured a hint of past success in 1994, all was not well behind the scenes. Modell was in financial trouble. The origins of Modell's woes dated to 1973, when he worked out a deal to lease Cleveland Municipal Stadium from the city for a pittance: only enough to service the facility's debt and pay property taxes.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|p=137}} Cleveland Browns Stadium Corporation, or Stadium Corp., a company Modell and a business associate created and owned, held the 25-year lease. Stadium Corp. then subleased the stadium to the Browns and the [[Cleveland Indians]], and rented it out for concerts and other events.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|pp=137<U+2013>138}} While the deal worked fine for the city and Modell early on, the owner was later dogged by excessive borrowing and lawsuits.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|pp=137<U+2013>145}}

[[File:1980-modell-browns crop.jpg|thumb|right|Cleveland owner Art Modell in 1983. Lawsuits by Browns minority owner Bob Gries and the Indians in the early 1980s exacerbated his financial problems.]]

When the stadium was profitable, Modell had used Stadium Corp. to buy land in [[Strongsville, Ohio|Strongsville]] that he had previously acquired as the potential site for a future new stadium. Modell originally paid $625,000 for the land, but sold it to his own Stadium Corp. for more than $3 million. Then, when the stadium was taking losses in 1981, he sold Stadium Corp. itself to the Browns for $6 million. This led to a fight the following year with Bob Gries, whose family had been part of the Browns' ownership group since its founding and had 43% of the team to Modell's 53%. Gries's complaint was that Modell treated the Browns and Stadium Corp. as his own fiefdom, rarely consulting him about the team's business. The sale of Stadium Corp. to the Browns, he argued, enriched Modell at the team's expense.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|pp=139<U+2013>140}} Gries's case went to the [[Supreme Court of Ohio|Ohio Supreme Court]], where he won. In 1986, Modell had to reverse the Browns' purchase of Stadium Corp. and pay $1 million in Gries's legal fees. This left Modell in need of financial help, and it came in the form of [[Al Lerner]], a cigar-chomping banking and real estate executive who bought half of Stadium Corp. and 5% of the Browns in 1986.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|p=139}}

His reputation damaged by the lawsuits, Modell was eager to get out of Cleveland. He met with Baltimore officials about selling the Browns to Lerner and buying an expansion team to replace the Colts, who had left for Indianapolis in 1984. He also discussed moving the Browns.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|p=143}} Proposals were made to spend $175 million on a stadium renovation after the Indians and [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] got new facilities in downtown Cleveland, but it was not enough.{{sfn|Morgan|1997|pp=143<U+2013>145}} As the Browns started the 1995 season with a 4<U+2013>4 record, word leaked that Modell was moving the team.<ref name="NYT on Browns move">{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Timothy W.|title=Baltimore Browns May Be a Done Deal|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/04/sports/football-baltimore-browns-may-be-a-done-deal.html?src=pm|accessdate=May 31, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 4, 1995}}</ref> Beset by rising player salaries and political indifference to the team's financial plight, he said he was forced to move.<ref name="SI on Browns move">{{cite journal|last=Munson|first=Lester|title=A Busted Play|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=December 4, 1995|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1007507/index.htm|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68UlqeldI|archivedate=June 17, 2012|accessdate=May 31, 2012}}</ref> The day after Modell formally announced the move, Cleveland voters overwhelmingly approved the $175 million of stadium renovations.

The city immediately sued to prevent the move, on the basis that the lease of the stadium was active until 1998. Fans were in an uproar, staging protests, signing petitions, filing lawsuits and appealing to other NFL owners to block the relocation. Advertisers pulled out of the stadium, fearing fans' ire.<ref name="NYT on Modell's move reaction">{{cite news|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|title=A City Fights To Save The Browns|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/12/sports/pro-football-a-city-fights-to-save-the-browns.html?ref=art_modell&pagewanted=all|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68Ulvzp8V|archivedate=June 17, 2012|accessdate=May 31, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 12, 1995}}</ref> Talks between the city, Modell and the NFL continued as the Browns finished the season with a 5<U+2013>11 record.

==Inactivity (1996<U+2013>1998)==

Preparations for a reactivated franchise began shortly after Modell, the city and the NFL struck their compromise. The NFL established the Cleveland Browns Trust to direct the Browns' return in early 1996, and in June  appointed Bill Futterer as its president.

Cleveland fans' hopes were high upon the arrival of the new team. Having made poor choices in both the expansion draft and the regular NFL draft, however, the Browns floundered.

A 2<U+2013>14 season in 1999 was followed by a 3<U+2013>13 record in 2000 after Couch suffered a season-ending thumb injury. Early in 2001, Policy and Lerner fired Palmer.
