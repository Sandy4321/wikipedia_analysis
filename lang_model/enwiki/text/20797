The '''Miles Merchantman''' was a scaled up and four-engined development of the [[Miles Aerovan]] light [[Cargo aircraft|freighter]].  It flew in 1947 but the design was abandoned when Miles Aircraft was taken over by [[Handley Page]] in 1948.

==Design and development==
The Miles M.71 Merchantman<ref name="Jackson">{{Harvnb|Jackson|1960|page=390}}</ref><ref name="Flight">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1947/1947%20-%201433.html ''Flight'' 28 August 1947 pp. 221-5]</ref> was intended to follow the successful  [[Miles Aerovan|Aerovan]] freighter as a larger aircraft built along similar lines.  Miles aimed to provide a simple, sturdy high-wing monoplane with an easily accessible and configurable cargo or passenger space.  This was achieved, as in the Aerovan by mounting the tail unit on a boom from the fuselage top, making access via the rear of the fuselage straightforward.  Intended for greater loads the Merchantman was bigger, heavier and more powerful than its predecessor: its span was larger by a factor of 1.33, all up weight by 2.2 and power by 3.2.<ref name="Jackson"/><ref name="JacksonA">{{Harvnb|Jackson|1960|page=168<U+2013>71}}</ref>

Unlike the Aerovan the Merchantman was intended to be a largely all metal framed aircraft,<ref name="Jackson"/> though the first prototype and only example built had wooden tail surfaces for speed of construction.<ref name="Flight"/>  The wing trailing edges behind the rear spar were fabric covered.<ref name="Flight"/>  The inner part of this trailing edge carried the usual Miles type flaps, hinged below the wings;
the ailerons on the outer sections were, unusually, mounted below the wing in the same way.<ref name="Flight"/>  The benefits of this latter mounting were that they could act as flaps as well as ailerons, drooping when the flaps were lowered; and that, mounted in the lower wing airstream they produced less [[adverse yaw]] than a conventional aileron.  The overall effect was rather like the Junkers "second wing", familiar from the Ju-52.  The Merchantman's extra power came from both the number and choice of engines: it had four 250&nbsp;hp (187&nbsp;kW) [[de Havilland Gipsy Queen]] inverted inline motors.  These were mounted in long cowlings on the underside of the wing, with fuel tanks behind the engine firewall.

The Merchantman had a similar boom mounted tail to the Aerovan, with an almost straight leading edge to the horizontal stabiliser, carrying elevators with trim tabs on a strongly tapered trailing edge.  There were three vertical surfaces, one central with a rudder and two endplate fins with large moveable surfaces that acted as trim tabs.<ref name="Flight"/>  The outer fins had the same shape found on many Miles aircraft: symmetrical and elliptical at the top but blunted below.  The Aerovan's central fin was semi-elliptical, but the initial arrangement on the Merchantman continued the ellipse below the boom.  This form was changed quite soon after the first flight tests, when a dorsal fin above the boom replaced the lower surface.<ref name="FlightA"/>

The flat sided fuselage did present a large keel area to be compensated by the fins.  On the other hand it produced a large uncluttered space that could be readily accessed via rear doors that included an integral ramp<ref name="Flight"/>  to the fuselage floor.  It had a volume of 780 cu ft (22.1 m<sup>3</sup>)<ref name="FlightC"/>  and the aircraft could carry loads of up to 5000&nbsp;lbs (2,268&nbsp;kg).<ref name="Flight"/>   Configured as a passenger aircraft, this space could seat twenty in five rows of four,<ref name="FlightA">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1947/1947%20-%201609.html ''Flight'' 18 September 1947 p.327]</ref> though there is no record that seats were installed.  It had a tricycle
undercarriage with stub axles mounted under the fuselage floor carrying short legs that bore a pair of small fixed main wheels, keeping the aircraft close to the ground for loading; the fuselage floor was only 2&nbsp;ft (610&nbsp;mm) above the ground.<ref name="Flight"/>  The nosewheel was steerable via the rudder bar as in the Aerovan.<ref name="FlightC"/>

The Merchantman first flew in mid-August 1947,<ref name="FlightC">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1947/1947%20-%201542.html ''Flight'' 11 September 1947 pp. 280]</ref> appearing at the 1947 [[Society of British Aerospace Companies|SBAC]] show at [[Radlett]] the following month with its new fin.<ref name="FlightA"/>  Only one was built, registered as ''G-AILF'' and flown under B class conditions as U-21<ref name="Jackson"/> at least as late as November<ref name="FlightB">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1947/1947%20-%202041.html ''Flight'' 20 November 1947 p.587]</ref>  1947.  Miles Aircraft ceased trading in 1947 and their assets were taken over by Handley Page; the Merchantman was scrapped in 1948. The wing of the Merchantman and the Marathon had much in common and so the former survived for a time.
