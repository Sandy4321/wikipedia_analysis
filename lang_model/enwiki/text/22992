'''State Route&nbsp;150''' (SR&nbsp;150) is a {{convert|11.76|mi|km|2|adj=on}} long [[State highways in Washington|state highway]] serving [[Chelan County, Washington|Chelan County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The highway begins in the [[unincorporated community]] of [[Manson, Washington|Manson]] and travels southeast along the north shore of [[Lake Chelan]] into [[Chelan, Washington|Chelan]], where it is briefly [[Concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with [[U.S. Route 97 Alternate (Washington)|U.S. Route&nbsp;97&nbsp;Alternate]] (US&nbsp;97&nbsp;Alternate). It ends at [[U.S. Route 97 in Washington|US&nbsp;97]] north of the [[Beebe Bridge]] on the [[Columbia River]] north of [[Chelan Falls, Washington|Chelan Falls]]. The road, which has existed since the 1890s, was signed as '''Secondary State Highway&nbsp;10C''' (SSH&nbsp;10C) and part of SSH&nbsp;10D in 1937. SSH&nbsp;10C became SR&nbsp;151 and SSH&nbsp;10D became SR&nbsp;150 in the [[1964 highway renumbering (Washington)|1964 highway renumbering]], the latter being renumbered in 1987 as part of US&nbsp;97.

Every year the [[Washington State Department of Transportation]] (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of [[average annual daily traffic]] (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 2,300 and 10,000 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly in Downtown Chelan on Woodin Avenue.<ref name="ATR">{{citation |author=Staff |year=2011 |title=2011 Annual Traffic Report |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/mapsdata/travel/pdf/Annual_Traffic_Report_2011.pdf |format=PDF |page=144 |accessdate=January 18, 2013}}</ref>
