The '''Solar Orbiter''' is a [[Sun]]-observing [[satellite]], in development by the [[ESA|European Space Agency]]. It is to be launched on a [[Soyuz launch vehicle|Soyuz-ST Fregat 2-1B]] from the [[Guiana Space Center]] in [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]] in May [[2015]]. It will perform close observations of the polar regions of the Sun, which is difficult to do from [[Earth]]. The Solar Orbiter will make observations of the Sun from distances as close as 45 solar radii, or 0.21 [[AU]]. It is predicted that the images obtained will be up to ten times as sharp as any images that can be taken today.
