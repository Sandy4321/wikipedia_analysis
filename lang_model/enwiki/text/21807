'''Johnny Pulado Estrada III''' (born June 27, 1976 in [[Hayward, California|Hayward]], [[California]]) was a [[Major League Baseball]] [[catcher]].

Estrada was selected in the 17th round of the [[1997 Major League Baseball Draft]] by the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. His major league career started in {{mlby|2001}} with the Phillies after an injury to the regular starting catcher, [[Mike Lieberthal]]. In {{mlby|2002}}, he became a part time player. Estrada was acquired by the [[Atlanta Braves]] from the Phillies on December 20, 2002, for [[Kevin Millwood]] in a move that was said to be financially motivated, since the Braves couldn't pay Millwood's salary. During the {{mlby|2003}} season, Estrada spent most of the year on Atlanta's [[AAA (baseball)|Triple-A]] team, the [[Richmond Braves]]. After [[Javy L<U+00F3>pez]] left due to free agency, Estrada became Atlanta's starting catcher in {{mlby|2004}}. He [[Batting average|hit]] .314 with 9 [[home run]]s and 76 [[Run batted in|RBI]]. Estrada also made the [[All-Star]] team and helped Atlanta win their 13th division title in a row. After a slightly disappointing {{mlby|2005}} season, Estrada was traded by the Braves to the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] for [[pitcher]]s [[Lance Cormier]] and [[<U+00D3>scar Villarreal]] on December 7, 2005.

The {{mlby|2006}} season saw Estrada return to his All-Star form. He hit .302 with 11 home runs and 71 RBI in 115 games. After the 2006 season, Estrada was traded to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] along with pitchers [[Claudio Vargas]] and [[Greg Aquino]] for pitchers [[Doug Davis (pitcher)|Doug Davis]] and [[Dana Eveland]] and [[outfielder]] [[Dave Krynzel]]. 

On November 20, {{mlby|2007}}, Estrada was traded from the Brewers to the [[New York Mets]] for pitcher [[Guillermo Mota]]. Estrada was not offered a new contract by the Mets and became a [[free agent]] on December 12, 2007. On January 31, {{mlby|2008}}, Estrada signed a one-year contract with the [[Washington Nationals]] worth approximately $1.25 million.<ref>[http://washington.nationals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080131&content_id=2360899&vkey=news_was&fext=.jsp&c_id=was The Official Site of The Washington Nationals: News: Estrada, Nationals finalize deal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On July 24, Estrada was designated for assignment,<ref>[http://washington.nationals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080724&content_id=3188111&vkey=news_was&fext=.jsp&c_id=was The Official Site of The Washington Nationals: News: Milledge returns as Estrada departs]</ref> and released on July 31.
