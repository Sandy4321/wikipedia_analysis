'''Southern Cross Campus (Te Taki o Autahi)''' is a composite school that caters for students Years 1-13 in the suburb of Mangere East in Manukau City, South Auckland. The school (affectionately referred to as SCC, <U+2018>The Campus<U+2019> or 'The Cross') has deep ties to the Mangere East community by providing excellent education, facilities, and programmes for the wider use of the whole school. It is a Maori and Pacific Islands ethnic school, with students of European (Pakeha), Asian, and other ethnicities as a 0.5% minority.

Southern Cross Campus is a fairly-new school to the Mangere ward of Manukau City, by being an institute amalgamated with three previous schools in the area: Southern Cross Primary School, Mangere Intermediate School, and Nga Tapuwae College. Now, the schools have all joined together to form Southern Cross Campus, a name in which surpasses all the traumatic histories that could have possibly affected the new point of direction for Southern Cross Campus. Southern Cross Campus was founded by Terry Bates (MA (Hons), MPhil (Hons), DipTchg (NZ)), the first Campus Director of the school.

Southern Cross Campus is made up of four schools which replace the three founding schools of the Campus: Southern Cross Junior School (Primary, Years 1-6), Southern Cross Middle School (Intermediate, Years 7-9), Southern Cross Senior School (Years 10-13), and Te Kura Maori o Nga Tapuwae (a total-immersion school for Maori education, Years 1-13). The educational aim of the Campus is <U+201C>to provide a seamless education for [their] students, so that school transitions are easy and that the student will have total confidence in moving from each level of schooling <U+2013> providing them with environmental confidence that would improve academic attainment in the classroom as they progress to senior levels of education.<U+201D>

The formation of the Campus began to take shape after a decision made by the New Zealand government's Ministry of Education concern for the school. Mr Terry Bates, an educational advisor of the Ministry, implemented an idea that the three schools in the area should integrate to create a seamless branch of education to cater for the students of this community. The decision was taken to the Ministry, and was then passed, seeing that this school would be the first of its kind in New Zealand.

After years of planning from the early 1990s the faulty Board Members of all the schools were disbanded, and a new Board was set to cater for all four schools, chaired by the late Ms Levuana Tanuvasa. Mr Bill McCook was the Commissioner of the Campus, and his role was to oversee the plans for the new school and to also make sure that the school was meeting government standards and satisfaction. Southern Cross Campus was born in 1995, and officially opened in 1998.

Southern Cross Campus is headed by Mr Robin Staples (Campus Director). The Campus Director is assisted by three other Directors: Director of Teaching and Learning Dir. Karen Mose, Director of Pastoral Care and Well-being Dir. Warren Waetford, and Director of Matauranga Maori and Te Kura Maori o Nga Tapuwae Ma Arihia Stirling.

== Southern Cross Junior School ==
Southern Cross Junior School is the primary education sector of the Campus that provides for students Years 1-6. The Junior School is situated in the northern most point of the Campus and is separated from the upper levels of the school and divided by the Junior/Middle School fields.

Junior School provides a strong education programme for its primary students, as these are the critical and foundation years in terms of primary education. They give their students an advanced head start at entry year levels (Years 1 and 2) so that they can have the confidence of obtaining new skills and ideas as they mature throughout Junior School. There are strong and expansive learning programmes to cater for their young pupils, as high literacy and numeracy grades are a must. Reading programmes, mathematic programmes, literacy programmes, and learning support for students who are second-language English speakers are offered at Junior School for students in the younger Year levels. The Life Education Trust, sponsored by the Auckland Airport, is a programme that outreaches to young pupils to engage them in further thinking of the natural world. School excursions to forest, nautical, zoology parks and museums are a must in exploring the real environment for social science and science topics taught in the curriculum.

At Years 5 and 6, students are encouraged to engage themselves in leadership and advanced academic study. The senior levels in Junior School participate in Junior School Prefects, Peer Mediation, House Leaders, Sports Leaders, School Road Patrols and the Advanced Learning Academy (SCJSALA). Students are also encouraged to join sports teams, playing a wide variety of primary sports, such as Rugby, Touch Rugby, Netball, Soccer, Athletics, Swimming, Cross-Country, Cricket, and Hockey. Cultural groups are also a must in Junior School to endorse cultural pride. The school offers Maori, Cook Islands Maori, Tongan, Samoan, Niuean, and Indian/Fijian clubs. They perform at the Mangere Primary Schools Cultural Festivals.

School House competitions are a highlight on the school calendar, as the four houses compete in an array of events to build unity and pride within the student body. The four houses are named after the first four letters of the Greek alphabet: Alpha (Blue and White), Beta (Gold and Brown), Gamma (Red and Black) and Delta (Green and Silver). Competitions include Sports, Athletics, Academic, and Swimming Carnivals. When the students move to Middle School they move in to the upper year level houses with the same colour, e.g. Alpha House students move in to Bates House.

Junior School has maintained a strict discipline of being a <U+201C>water-only and healthy eating school.<U+201D> Students and parents are encouraged to bring a water bottle and healthy lunch to school. Junk food and confectionery items are not permitted as student lunch. The Campus bucket sunhats are a compulsory item as students are to be outside with their sunhats on, as this is for sun-safety and awareness of being smart in the sun. 

The Junior School is managed by two Deputy Directors who take care of the two aspects of school life: Mrs Brenda Woolley is Deputy Director of Pastoral Care and Mrs Lesley Pether is Deputy Director of Teaching and Learning.

== Southern Cross Middle School ==

SCC Middle School, is the intermediate level of the Campus. Replacing Mangere Intermediate since the amalgamation of the Campus, the Middle School still continues to make impressive changes which have influence the progression of the Campus dramatically. Along with the Campus Motto the Middle School also emphasizes the phrase "Search for the hero inside yourself", which contemplates with the idea of self-reliance and leadership - a strong concept in the Campus.

The Middle School caters for students from Years 7-9. At Year 7 they accept students from the surrounding primary schools, as well as their own Junior School. The Middle School is the founding school on which binds the students from within the area who have not attended SCC Junior School for primary education. At the Year 9 level, which is meant to be entry year level for secondary school, students are accepted from accepting intermediate schools. From Middle School, students are automatically sent to Senior School.

The Middle School is the school of the Campus that teaches them to <U+201C>wise up<U+201D> rather than <U+201C>grow up<U+201D>. This concept suits the school ideals as students are taught to be more physically and mentally disciplined. Across the school, Deans take charge of their respective year groups and remain with them until their last year of Middle School. Alongside their Tutor Class teachers the Dean provides Pastoral Care and management of their Year.

The Middle School<U+2019>s curriculum has been shaped to meet the demands of higher learning that can be compared with the curriculum of other advancing schools. This is to provide the students with educational motivation to show that they can equally succeed with other schools from outside their communities. The advances of the learning programme of the Middle School has been a major benefit to ERO Reports as they continue to positively progress each report.

Middle School activities include inter-house Swimming, Athletics, and Academic challenges, as well as inter-class and inter-Year challenges. This is to provide that sense of whanau as they settle in to the Southern Cross fold of learning and community. Highlights of the School Calendar include Year 9 Camp, the Strings Project (Violin and Cello lessons), Drama productions, school bands, Nature trips, and the annual cultural festival and performance night.

The Middle School is co-ordinated by the two Deputy Directors and Senior Management <U+2013> Mr Taoro Taia is Deputy Director of Pastoral Care and Mr David Valgre is the Deputy Director of Teaching and Learning.

== Southern Cross Senior School ==

SCC Senior School caters for the eldest students of the student body from Years 10-13. The school itself is the reincarnation of the old Nga Tapuwae College, however historical aspects of the old school do not exist in the modern Senior School of today. The Senior School, along with the School Motto <U+2018>Ina Te Mahi He Rangatira<U+2019>, also aspire themselves with two other adages: <U+2018>if it is to be, it is up to me<U+2019> to contemplate the idea of leadership and perseverance; as well as a line from the School<U+2019>s alma mater <U+2018>Honour, Strength, and Pride<U+2019>, which empowers the students to motivate and achieve.

Historically, Nga Tapuwae College was the symbol of <U+201C>drop out, put down, no good nonsense<U+201D> of this growing community. However, since the amalgamation of the Campus the Senior School has gone through many changes, including the school structure, policies, conduct, and student atmosphere. Now, the school provides motivation, determination, and self-perseverance <U+2013> a symbol of opportunity for the Campus.

Academically, the Senior School continues to grow with pleasing results, as well as advanced expectations and surprising achievement. Since the educational programme of national secondary schools changed from School Certificate to the new National Certificate in Educational Achievement (NCEA), the school has steadfastly attained overwhelming results and academic achievement, which has brought a positive light on to this learning community. School leavers who go without any qualification (NCEA Levels 1-3/School Cert, Sixth Form Cert, and Bursary) has dropped from 70% to an outstanding 2%. This has been a long-term goal in which has been attained, thanks to structured motivation and positive peer pressure. In Senior School students are given two opportunities: To pass or not to pass. However, they use this as a motivation tool to see whether or not they will make the right choices. This has worked sufficiently as many students choose for the <U+201C>passing<U+201D> option in fear of being nothing and worthless. A obscure tiny few choose the other option, but they do not compare to those who choose the viable path.

In the sporting arena Senior School has made a name for themselves, especially in the Netball, Rugby Union, Rugby League, and Waka<U+2019>ama (Outrigging) fields. The school prides itself in its accomplishments, and the participating students are hugely supported by their fellow peers who watch from the sidelines. A notable alumnus, Valerie Vili (n<U+00E9>e Adams) is a world champion athlete in the sport of Shot Put. 

The Senior School has a strong Pasifika heritage, contributed by the diverse Pacific Islands student body. The Senior School has no students of European descent (probably due to the strength and population of the Pacific atmosphere) and a probable six students (or less) of South-east Asian decent. The students participate in the annual ASB Bank Maori and Pacific Islands Cultural Festivals held in Manukau each year, sending performers of Tongan, Samoan, Cook Islands, and Niuean heritage to compete in the competition. Musically, the school has a strong tradition in string, guitar, and singing instrument, as well as a growing brass and percussion bands. The school is new to the Drama concept; however deliver productions that are of a congratulatory calibre.

The Senior School also participate in regional and local youth events, such as Speech Competitions, debates, symposia, and international health forums. Students are also given the chance to participate in student tutoring programmes run by the University of Auckland, called the MATES Programme. The school is well known for their orators, who have represented New Zealand at regional, national and international levels.

A Senior Management Team and the Senior School Prefects maintain the pastoral care of the students. The Senior Management Team, which consists of the two Deputy Directors, Campus Directors, and Deans of each level engage themselves in providing proper well-being and services for a functional school. The Senior School Prefects, who consist of the two Head Prefects, two Deputy Head Prefects, two Sports Captains and six School Prefects, maintain playground duties, morning and afternoon gate patrolling, lifting school and spirit morale, managing student programmes and activities, manage School Assemblies, and are responsible to each respective Year Group. The student leaders in the Senior School do not just come from the Prefects core group. Students from the Senior Levels (Years 12 and 13) also provide leadership for programmes in the school. However, the Prefects are responsible for any activity that the student body wishes to do. The Student Representative to the Board of Trustees is usually chosen from the Year 12 class (who move on to Year 13 the following year, in which they carry out their term) but it can be chosen from anyone Years 7-13.)

The Senior Management Team for the Senior School is Mr Colin Gray, Deputy Director of Pastoral Care, and Ms Heather Muir, Deputy Director of Teaching and Learning.

== Te Kura Maori o Nga Tapuwae ==
[[Image:TKM_MARAE.jpg]]
<br />''Kororia ki te Matua i te Rangi,''
<br />''Nana nei nga katoa''
<br />''Ka maharatia te hunga kua wehe atu ki tua o te Arai, haere koutou, haere koutou haere ki te tonuitanga o te ra, haere ki te tinitanga o te po, te hunga mate ki te hunga mate. 
<br />''Apiti hono tatai hono te hunga ora, ki te hunga ora Tihei Mauri Ora!''
<br />''Ki nga Reo, ki nga Mana, ki nga karangatanga maha, tena koutou, tena koutou, tena koutou katoa.
<br />''Ko te tumanako - kia tau nga manaakitanga o te Runga Rawa ki runga i a koutou katoa.''

Te Kura Maori o Nga Tapuwae are a part of an exciting new educational development called Southern Cross Campus. The Campus consists of Te Kura Maori o Nga Tapuwae (Rumaki Reo, Takawaenga, Tuarua), a Junior School, a Middle School and a Senior School.

The Campus is increasingly integrating all its management, staffing resources and curriculum requirements on to the one site. Our ambition at Southern Cross Campus is to create an effective and high quality <U+201C>One Stop Education Stop<U+201D>.

The majority of the students are from a Maori background. At Te Kura Maori o Nga Tapuwae they are developing curriculum pathways in Te Reo Rangatira, Sports, Science, recreation, The Arts, Business Studies and Engineering while emphasising a quality core programme and Academic excellence. Extra curricular activities in Sport, Music, Theatre Sports, Drama and Culture are well supported. With the addition of an ex-student Culture Group Te Kura Maori o Nga Tapuwae is also supported by the Marae Committee, which holds monthly meetings from 7:00pm to 8:00pm.
 
Te Kura Maori o Nga Tapuwae is an integral part of Southern Cross Campus. The Kura has classes ranging from New Entrants (Year 0) to Form 7 (Year 13). Having classes available in all age groups allows Te Kura Maori o Nga Tapuwae to foster the philosophy of whanau. Here at Te Kura Maori o Nga Tapuwae we take the concept of whanau very seriously and this is embedded in our daily routines, which ensures our students a safe place for learning.

There are two expectations that make the Kura different from other areas of the Campus and they are:

1. Students must take Te Reo Maori as a compulsory subject like English, Maths and Science.
2. Students must do Culture as this is also a compulsory activity, which is not only an extension of the language but also an enhancement.

Te Kura Maori o Nga Tapuwae prides itself on providing an excellent <U+2018>one stop<U+2019> school where parents do not have to worry about going from one school to another to <U+2018>drop off<U+2019> or <U+2018>pick up<U+2019> their other children. The School's focus is on quality programmes and encouraging student excellence. They  expect a strong relationship with parents and believe that the parent support group is the best in the country.

Te Kura Maori o Nga Tapuwae is headed by Ma Arihia Stirling, who is also the Campus Director of Matauranga Maori (Maori Education). She is assisted by Mereana Anderson and Renae Maxwell.

== Campus Uniforms ==

The Southern Cross Campus uniforms are subjected to the approval of the Campus Board of Trustees. They are designed for community identity and to encourage school pride and unity. All students on Campus agree to wear the correct uniforms daily as prescribed in their enrolment. All students are to maintain and manage their own uniforms, and have each item clearly labelled.

Jewellery is not to be worn at all times. The only jewelleries that can be worn are two small studs in the earlobes alone and a watch. Bracelets, bangles, and necklaces/chains are not permitted. Items of family/cultural significance are to be worn under the uniform and must not be visible. 

Parents are advised as to when uniform changes are required between seasons: Terms 1 and 4 are Summer Uniforms, Terms 2 and 3 are Winter Uniforms. Students are to abide by the strict regulations regarding uniforms.

Formal uniforms for senior students are to be strictly abided by, or else they will not be able to participate in formal events.

==SCC House Systems==
The House/Whare systems of Southern Cross Campus start in the Junior School right through to Senior School. However, as students move from Junior School to Middle School their houses are swapped to the senior Houses of the same colour. From Middle School to Senior School the students in that House remain in the same House. For example, if a Junior School student was in Beta House (Gold and Brown) they would move in to Graham House (Gold and Brown), and stay there until they finish school. This is to enhance student morale, belonging, and the concept of legacy. The students of each school are randomly selected in to their Houses, but are also divided based on heritage of older or former family lines. The Houses of Southern Cross Campus are as follows:

In the Middle and Senior Schools each house is run by three Prefects <U+2013> two School Prefects and one of either the Head Boy/Girl or the Deputy Head Boy/Girl. They help lead each house and are given responsibilities such as organising events, competitions, student advocacy, house war chants, and endorse House pride. Each House has a House Dean who is assisted by other tutor teachers belonging to that house. 

House Competitions are run twice a term - Swimming and Athletics in the first term, Winter Sports and Academic House Challenges in the second term, and performing arts in the third term.
