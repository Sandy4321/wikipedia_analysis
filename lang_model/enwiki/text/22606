[[Image:PeriplusMap.jpg|thumb|500px|Roman trade with India according to the ''Periplus Maris Erythraei,'' [[1st century CE]].]]'''Roman trade with India''' started around the beginning of the [[Common Era]] (CE) following the reign of [[Augustus]] and [[<U+00C6>gyptus|his conquest]] of [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Egypt]].<ref name=Shaw1/> The use of [[monsoon]] winds, which enabled a voyage safer than a long and dangerous coastal voyage, helped enhance trade between [[India]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]].<ref name=Young1/> Roman trade diaspora stopped in [[Southern India]], establishing trading settlements which remained long after the fall of the [[Roman empire]]<ref name=Curtin1>Curtin 1984: 100</ref> and Rome's loss of the [[Red Sea]] ports,<ref name=Holl1>Holl 2003: 9</ref> which had previously been used to secure trade with India by the [[Greco-Roman world]] since the time of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]].<ref name=Lindsay1/>

==Background==
[[Image:Diadochen1.png|thumb|right|float|500px|The Seleucid and the Ptolemaic dynasties controlled trade networks to India before the establishment of Roman Egypt.
{{legend|#787CAD|Kingdom of [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]]}}{{legend|#C3B933|Kingdom of [[Seleucus]]}}]]
The [[Seleucid dynasty]] controlled a developed network of trade with India which had previously existed under the influence of the [[Persian]] [[Achaemenid dynasty]].<ref name=Potter1>Potter 2004: 20</ref> The Greek Ptolemaic dynasty, controlling the western and northern end of other trade routes to [[Arabia|Southern Arabia]] and India,<ref name=Potter1/> had begun to exploit trading opportunities with India prior to the Roman involvement but according to the historian [[Strabo]] the volume of commerce between India and Greece was not comparable to that of later Indian-Roman trade.<ref name=Young1/>

The ''[[Periplus Maris Erythraei]]'' mentions a time when sea trade between India and Egypt did not involve direct sailings.<ref name=Young1>Young 2001: 19</ref> The cargo under these situations was shipped to [[Aden]]:<ref name=Young1/>

<blockquote>Eudaimon Arabia was called fortunate, being once a city, when, because ships neither came from India to [[Egypt]] nor did those from Egypt dare to go further but only came as far as this place, it received the cargoes from both, just as [[Alexandria]] receives goods brought from outside and from Egypt.</blockquote>

The Ptolemaic dynasty had developed trade with India using the Red Sea ports.<ref name=Shaw1>Shaw 2003: 426</ref> With the establishment of Roman Egypt, the Romans took over and further developed the already existing trade using these ports.<ref name=Shaw1/> 

==Establishment==
[[Image:AugustusCoinPudukottaiHoardIndia.jpg|thumb|Coin of the Roman emperor [[Augustus]] found at the [[Pudukottai]] hoard. [[British Museum]].]]

The replacement of [[Greece]] by the Roman empire as the administrator of the [[Mediterranean]] basin led to the strengthening of direct maritime trade with the east and the elimination of the taxes extracted previously by the middlemen of various land based trading routes.<ref name=Lach1>Lach 1994: 13</ref> Strabo's mention of the vast increase in trade following the Roman annexation of Egypt indicates that monsoon was known and manipulated for trade in his time.<ref>Young 2001: 20</ref>

The trade started by [[Eudoxus of Cyzicus]] in 130 BCE kept increasing, and according to Strabo (II.5.12.):<ref name=Strabo1>{{cite web| title = The Geography of Strabo published in Vol. I of the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1917|url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html| format = HTML}}</ref>

<blockquote>
"At any rate, when [[Cornelius Gallus|Gallus]] was prefect of Egypt, I accompanied him and ascended the [[Nile]] as far as [[Aswan|Syene]] and the frontiers of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Ethiopia]], and I learned that as many as one hundred and twenty vessels were sailing from [[Myos Hormos]] to India, whereas formerly, under the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemies]], only a very few ventured to undertake the voyage and to carry on traffic in Indian merchandise."
</blockquote>

By the time of Augustus up to 120 ships were setting sail every year from Myos Hormos to India.<ref name=Strabo1/> So much gold was used for this trade, and apparently recycled by the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] for their own coinage, that [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (NH VI.101) complained about the drain of specie to India:<ref>"minimaque computatione miliens centena milia sestertium annis omnibus India et Seres et paeninsula illa imperio nostro adimunt: tanti nobis deliciae et feminae constant. quota enim portio ex illis ad deos, quaeso, iam vel ad inferos pertinet?" Pliny, Historia Naturae 12.41.84.</ref>

<blockquote>
"India, China and the Arabian peninsula take one hundred million [[sesterce]]s from our empire per annum at a conservative estimate: that is what our luxuries and women cost us. For what percentage of these imports is intended for sacrifices to the gods or the spirits of the dead?" - <small>Pliny, Historia Naturae 12.41.84.</small>
</blockquote>

==Ports==
===Roman Ports===
The three main Roman ports involved with eastern trade were [[Arsinoe]], [[Berenice Troglodytica|Berenice]] and [[Myos Hormos]]. Arsione was one of the early trading centers but was soon overshadowed by the more easily accessible Myos Hormos and Berenice.

====Arsinoe====
[[Image:Egypt-region-map-cities.gif|thumb|260px|right|Sites of Egyptian Red Sea ports, including Alexandria and Berenice.]]
The Ptolemaic dynasty exploited the strategic position of [[Alexandria]] to secure trade with India.<ref name=Lindsay1>Lindsay 2006: 101</ref> The course of trade with the east then seems to have been first through the harbor of Arsinoe, the present day [[Suez]].<ref name=Lindsay1/> The goods from the East African trade were landed at one of the three main Roman ports, Arsinoe, Berenice or Myos Hormos.<ref>O'Leary 2001: 72</ref> The Romans cleared out the canal from the Nile to harbor center of [[Arsinoe]] on the Red Sea, which had silted up.<ref name=Fayle1>Fayle 2006: 52</ref>  This was one of the many efforts the Roman administration had to undertake to divert as much of the trade to the maritime routes as possible.<ref name=Fayle1/>

Arsinoe was eventually overshadowed by the rising prominence of Myos Hermos.<ref name=Fayle1/> The navigation to the northern ports, such as Arsinoe-Clysma, became difficult in comparison to Myos Hermos due to the northern winds in the [[Gulf of Suez]].<ref name=Freeman1>Freeman 2003: 72</ref> Venturing to these northern ports presented additional difficulties such as [[shoals]], [[reef]]s and treacherous [[Ocean current|currents]].<ref name=Freeman1/>

====Myos Hormos and Berencie====

Myos Hormos and Berencie appear to have been important ancient trading ports, possibly used by the [[Pharaonic]] traders of ancient Egypt and the Ptolemaic dynasty before falling into Roman control.<ref name=Shaw1/>

The site of Berenice, since its discovery by Belzoni (1818), has been equated  with the ruins near [[Ras Banas]] in Southern Egypt.<ref name=Shaw1/> However, the precise location of Myos Hormos is disputed with the latitude and longitude given in [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' favoring Abu Sha'ar and the accounts given in [[classical literature]] and [[satellite images]] indicating a probable identification with Quesir el-Quadim at the end of a fortified road from [[Koptos]] on the [[Nile]].<ref name=Shaw1/> The Quesir el-Quadim site has further been associated with Myos Hormos following the excavations at el-Zerqa, halfway along the route, which have revealed [[ostraca]] leading to the conclusion that the port at the end of this road may have been Myos Hormos.<ref name=Shaw1/>

===Indian ports===
In India, the ports of [[Barbaricum]] (modern [[Karachi]]), [[Bharuch|Barygaza]], and [[Muziris]] and [[Arikamedu]] on the southern tip of India were the main centers of this trade. The ''Periplus Maris Erythraei'' describes Greco-Roman merchants selling in Barbaricum "thin clothing, figured linens, [[topaz]], [[coral]], [[storax]], [[frankincense]], vessels of glass, silver and gold plate, and a little wine" in exchange for "[[costus]], [[bdellium]], [[boxthorn|lycium]], [[spikenard|nard]], [[turquoise]], [[lapis lazuli]], Seric skins, cotton cloth, [[silk]] yarn, and [[indigo dye|indigo]]".<ref name=Periplus1/> In Barygaza, they would buy wheat, rice, sesame oil, cotton and cloth.<ref name=Periplus1/>

====Barigaza====
Trade with Barigaza, under the control of the [[Indo-Scythian]] [[Western Satrap]] [[Nahapana]] ("Nambanus"), was especially flourishing:<ref name=Periplus1>{{cite web| last = Halsall | first = Paul | title = Ancient History Sourcebook: The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: Travel and Trade in the Indian Ocean by a Merchant of the First Century| publisher = Fordham University| url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/periplus.html| format = HTML}}</ref>

<blockquote>
There are imported into this market-town ([[Barigaza]]), wine, Italian preferred, also Laodicean and Arabian; copper, tin, and lead; coral and topaz; thin clothing and inferior sorts of all kinds; bright-colored girdles a cubit wide; storax, sweet clover, flint glass, realgar, antimony, gold and silver coin, on which there is a profit when exchanged for the money of the country; and ointment, but not very costly and not much. And for the King there are brought into those places very costly vessels of silver, singing boys, beautiful maidens for the harem, fine wines, thin clothing of the finest weaves, and the choicest ointments. There are exported from these places spikenard, costus, bdellium, ivory, agate and carnelian, lycium, cotton cloth of all kinds, silk cloth, mallow cloth, yarn, long pepper and such other things as are brought here from the various market-towns. Those bound for this market-town from Egypt make the voyage favorably about the month of July, that is Epiphi. - <small>Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, paragraph 49.</small>
</blockquote>

====Muziris====
[[Image:TabulaPeutingerianaMuziris.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Muziris, as shown in the in the [[Tabula Peutingeriana]].]]
[[Muziris]] is a lost port city in the South Indian state of [[Kerala]] which was a major center of trade with the Roman Empire.<ref name=BBC1>{{cite news | title = Search for India's ancient city| publisher = BBC| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4970452.stm}}</ref> Large hoards of coins and innumerable shards of [[amphora]]e found in the town of [[Pattanam]] have elicited recent archeological interest in finding a probable location of this port city.<ref name=BBC1/>

According to the Periplus, numerous Greek seamen managed an intense trade with Muziris:<ref name=Periplus1/>

<blockquote>
"Muziris and Nelcynda, which are now of leading importance (...) Muziris, of the same kingdom, abounds in ships sent there with cargoes from Arabia, and by the Greeks; it is located on a river, distant from Tyndis by river and sea five hundred stadia, and up the river from the shore twenty stadia." - <small>The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, 53-54</small>
</blockquote>

[[Pliny the Elder]] also matter-of-factly commented on the qualities of Muziris, although in not very favorable term:<ref>Pliny the Elder, Historia Naturae 6.26</ref>

<blockquote>
"If the wind, called Hippalus, happens to be blowing, it is possible to arrive in forty days at the nearest market of India, called Muziris. This, however, is not a particularly desirable place to disembark, on account of the pirates which frequent its vicinity, where they occupy a place called Nitrias; nor, in fact, is it very rich in products. Besides, the road-stead for shipping is a considerable distance from the shore, and the cargoes have to be conveyed in boats, either for loading or discharging." - <small>Pliny the Elder, Historia Naturae 6.26</small>
</blockquote>

====Arikamedu====
The ''Periplus Maris Erythraei'' mentions a marketplace named Poduke (ch. 60), which G.W.B. Huntingford identified as possibly being [[Arikamedu]] (now part of [[Ariyankuppam]]), about 2 miles from the modern [[Pondicherry]].<ref name=Huntingford1>Huntingford 1980: 119.</ref> Huntingford further notes that Roman pottery was found at Arikamedu in 1937, and [[archeology|archeological]] excavations between 1944 and 1949 showed that it was "a trading station to which goods of Roman manufacture were imported during the first half of the 1st century AD".<ref name=Huntingford1/>

==Cultural exchanges==
[[Image:AugustusIndianImitation1stCenturyCE.jpg|thumb|A 1st century CE Indian imitation of a coin of Augustus, [[British Museum]].]]
The Rome-India trade also saw several cultural exchanges which had lasting effect for both the civilizations and others involved in the trade. The [[Ethiopia|Ethiopian]] kingdom of [[Aksum]] was involved in the [[Indian Ocean]] trade network and was influenced by Roman culture and Indian architecture.<ref name=Curtin1/> Traces of Indian influences are visible in Roman works of silver and ivory, or in Egyptian cotton and silk fabrics used for sale in [[Europe]].<ref name=Lach2>Lach 1994: 18</ref> The Indian presence in Alexandria may have influenced the culture but little is known about the manner of this influence.<ref name=Lach2/> [[Clement of Alexandria]] mentions the [[Buddha]] in his writings and other [[Indian religion]]s find mentions in other texts of the period.<ref name=Lach2/>

[[Christian]] and [[Jew]] settlers from the Rome continued to live in India long after the decline in bilateral trade.<ref name=Curtin1/> Large hoards of Roman coins have been found throughout India, and especially in the busy maritime trading centers of the south.<ref name=Curtin1/> The South Indian kings reissued Roman coinage in their own name after defacing the coins in order to signify their sovereignty.<ref name=Kulke1>Kulke 2004: 108</ref> Mentions of the traders are recorded in the [[Tamil]] [[Sangam literature]] of India.<ref name=Kulke1/> One such mention reads: "The beautifully built ships of the [[Yavanas]] came with gold and returned with pepper, and Muziris resounded with the noise."<ref name=Kulke1/>

==Decline==
[[Image:Age-of-caliphs.png|thumb|350px|Egypt under the rule of the [[Rashidun]]. {{legend|#a1584e|Prophet Mohammad, 622-632}} {{legend|#ef9070|Patriarchal Caliphate, 632-661}} {{legend|#fad07d|Umayyad Caliphate, 661-750}}|right]]Following the [[Roman-Persian Wars]] the areas under the Roman [[Byzantine Empire]] were captured by [[Khosrow I]] of the [[Persian]] Sassanian Dynasty.<ref>Farrokh 2007: 252</ref> The Arabs, led by [['Amr ibn al-'As]], crossed into Egypt in late 639 or early 640 CE.<ref name=Meri1>Meri 2006: 224</ref> This advance marked the beginning of the [[Islamic conquest of Egypt]]<ref name=Meri1/> and the fall of ports such as Alexandria,<ref name=Holl1/> used to secure trade with India by the Greco Roman world since the Ptolemaic dynasty.<ref name=Lindsay1/>

The decline in trade saw Southern India turn to [[Southeast Asia]] for international trade, where it influenced the native culture to a greater degree than the impressions made on Rome.<ref>Kulke 2004: 106</ref>

The [[Ottoman Turks]] conquered [[Constantinople]] in the [[15th century]], marking the beginning of Turkish control over the most direct trade routes between Europe and Asia.<ref>The Encyclopedia Americana 1989: 176</ref>
