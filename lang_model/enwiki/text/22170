After this round, the contestants were separated into 4 groups, and 3 groups went though with 44 contestants chosen.  In the [[Pasadena Civic Center]], each were individually taken via elevator to the judges where the verdict if they would be chosen or not was announced.  20 were cut and the final 24, 12 men and 12 woman, selected.

===Elimination song===
A new feature this year, the show now uses a special song to make a tribute to an eliminated contestant's journey on the show, as opposed to before when various different melodic music compositions were played. This year, the song used for an eliminated contestant's flashback tribute was "[[Bad Day (Daniel Powter song)|Bad Day]]" by [[Daniel Powter]].

===The finale===
On the finale, [[Carrie Underwood]] sang "[[Don't Forget to Remember Me]]" solo along with the song "Through the Rain" with the 12 finalists. Also, the finalists performed two medleys: one medley was for the female finalists and the other for the male finalists. Several special guests performed with one of the top five Idols: [[Al Jarreau]] ([[Paris Bennett]]), [[Live (band)|Live]] ([[Chris Daughtry]]), [[Meat Loaf]] ([[Katharine McPhee]]), [[Mary J. Blige]] ([[Elliott Yamin]]) and [[Toni Braxton]] ([[Taylor Hicks]]). [[Clay Aiken]] performed with lookalike auditioner Michael Sandecki, who resembled Aiken [[circa]] his 2005 audition. Also, [[Prince (artist)|Prince]] performed without an Idol. Towards the end of the program, the finalists performed "That's What Friends Are For" with [[Dionne Warwick]] as well as other songs in the [[Burt Bacharach]] canon, with Burt Bacharach playing the piano. Several auditioners from the first round returned to accept "Golden Idol" awards, and to sing. A parody of ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' (though there was no mention of [[homosexuality]]) called "Brokenote Mountain," featuring a group of three failed auditioners (Layne Johnson, Michael Evans, and Matthew Buckstein) was replayed from the Hollywood round.  The trio "The Brokenote Cowboys" then performed the [[Waylon Jennings]] & [[Willie Nelson]] song "[[Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to be Cowboys]]".  In a pre-taped segment, finalist [[Kellie Pickler]] ate lunch with [[Wolfgang Puck]] at his [[brasserie]] as a way of making fun of Kellie's admitted lack of culinary savvy. Finally, just before the results were announced, Hicks and McPhee performed "[[(I've Had) The Time of My Life]]".

The chairman of [[TeleScope Inc.]], the company which manages the ''American Idol'' results, came at the end of the show with the result card. 578 million votes were cast for the season with 63.5 million votes in the finale,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telescope.tv/press_idol_06.html |title=Telescope Inc |publisher=Telescope.tv |date= |accessdate=August 25, 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080216190533/http://www.telescope.tv/press_idol_06.html |archivedate = February 16, 2008}}</ref>  and Taylor Hicks was named the winner, the second ''American Idol'' winner from the city of [[Birmingham, Alabama]] (the first being [[Ruben Studdard]]), and the fourth finalist with close ties to the city.

==DialIdol==
{{Main|DialIdol}}
''DialIdol'' is both the name of a [[computer program]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] and its associated website that began tracking contestants during Season 4 and sprang to prominence at the start of Season 5. The program allows users to automatically vote for the ''American Idol'' contestants of their choice using their PC's [[modem|phone modem]]. The program then reports back to the main website, which keeps track of the results based on the percentage of calls for each contestant that result in a [[busy signal]]. Based on the data received, the website then predicts which contestants may be eliminated or may be in danger of being eliminated. As of May 25, 2006, its predictions for Season 5 were 87% accurate.<ref>[http://www.dialidol.com/asp/predictions/Predictions.asp Predictions for elimination of contestants]</ref>

This was the first season in which the free U.S. public service website, [[Zabasearch.com]], started to openly present voting results (starting with the top 12 and onward) that it claims are from Cingular and American Idol. It has experienced controversy over the fact that its results change throughout the day until (and often through) the results show.

==Controversy==
{{Main|American Idol controversy}}
* In January 2006, twins Derrell and Terrell Brittenum were charged with forgery and theft after allegedly using a false identity to purchase a car. <!-- Reference no longer available at http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/19/idol.twins.ap/index.html --> This occurred after the "Hollywood" portion of the show was filmed, and the twins were subsequently disqualified.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,183020,00.html 'Idol' Twins Booted for Alleged ID Theft]</ref>
* [[Simon Cowell]] said that he did not like "last year's winner" as much as Kellie Pickler. He has since said that it was a heat of the moment thing, as Carrie Underwood had performed on the show the week before and was not very fond of the performance.
* In January 2006, the [[Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD) expressed concern about the show's portrayal of some contestants: "The real offense here was in the producer's decision to add insult to injury by turning a contestant's gender expression into the butt of a joke." Damon Romine, Entertainment Media Director, on January 20.<ref>[http://www.glaad.org/media/release_detail.php?id=3860 Some Online Media Inaccurately Report GLAAD's Concerns About American Idol]</ref>
* In January 2006 [[NAAFA|The National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance]], NAAFA accused the show of being discriminatory towards its plus sized contestants.  <!-- Reference unavailable at http://tmz.aol.com/article2?id=20060124161509990001] -->
* In February 2006, it was discovered that [[Jos<U+00E9> "Sway" Penala]] was reportedly signed to E-Real Records with his band 6th Day, at the time of his audition. <!--ref (previously at http://tv.yahoo.com/news/article/urn:newsml:tv.ap.org:20070302:tv_american_idol__ER:1;_ylt=AgMNwCOhz5HVRE.M3tzvdx36o9EF) doesn't point where it should. Removed for now -->
* Two rumors about finalist [[Katharine McPhee]] circulated during early March and throughout the season. The first was that she was quitting the show and would not show up for the March 7th airing. The second was sparked by the loose fitting blouses she had been wearing, leading viewers to suspect she was pregnant. Katharine denied both rumors when interviewed by host Ryan Seacrest on the March 7th show.<ref>[http://www.realitytvmagazine.com/blog/2006/03/american_idol_k.html Rumors Circulate That Katharine McPhee Quit American Idol]</ref>
* During the March 28 show while Mandisa Hundley was singing, her name and phone number came up, but changed for a few seconds and showed Taylor Hicks' name and phone number. At the end of the show the numbers were right.<ref>[http://www.realitytvmagazine.com/blog/2006/03/more_american_i.html More American Idol Phone Number Madness, Wrong Number For Mandisa]</ref>
* Mandisa Hundley was voted out after country week, whereby her rendition of "Any Man of Mine" was not well received as a good song choice. The reason behind her elimination was speculated to be what she said before she began to sing her rendition of "Shackles (Praise You)" by [[Mary Mary]]: "This song goes out to everybody that wants to be free. Your addiction, lifestyle and situation may be big, but God is bigger." Many viewers believed that the "lifestyle" stated was regarding the homosexual lifestyle, which she denied, clarifying that the lifestyle she was referring to was her lifestyle of addiction to food.  Mandisa is a former employee of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], having joined the Convention in 2000 as a telephone sales representative for their LifeWay book division, and later in their women's enrichment events area, and later Beth Moore's ''Living Proof Live'' events. (Moore's books are published by LifeWay.)<ref>[http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?ID=22994 Mandisa, off 'Idol,' says fans' prayers will have 'full force']</ref>
* On the April 25 show, the theme of which was Greatest Love Songs and featured guest coaches Andrea Bocelli and David Foster, executive producer Nigel Lythgoe forced contestant Taylor Hicks to change his song a day before air time (and the same day as the dress rehearsal). Hicks' chosen song was "Try a Little Tenderness," but Lythgoe, in a radio interview, claimed the song was more appropriate for a Blues Brothers week and was not a song that Andrea Bocelli would sing. Hicks changed his song at the last minute to "Just Once" (James Ingram) and appeared very uncomfortable on stage. Hicks fans were distressed, feeling that a) Hicks' original choice of song was very appropriate to the theme; b) The producers changed the song at the last minute even though they must have known Hicks' choice the previous week as they must obtain clearance for all songs; c) Lythgoe's statement that it was not a song Andrea Bocelli would sing was dubious, as other song choices that were approved were songs sung by Bryan Adams ("Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman," sung by Chris Daughtry) and Donny Hathaway ("A Song for You," sung by Elliott Yamin).<ref>[http://www.tvweek.com/docs/docs/Idol_4_26.mp3 Lythgoe on the radio]</ref>
* During the East Coast transmission of the May 2 show, Paris Bennett was bleeped while singing Mary J. Blige's "Be Without You" at the exact point where an obscenity appears in the lyrics.  However, Fox confirmed that the song was not bleeped when it was broadcast on the West Coast. Forum posters on the West Coast said Bennett sang the radio edit of the song which excludes the obscenity, leaving viewers nationwide wondering why Bennett was precensored during the earlier live transmission. Paris was eliminated in the results show the day after.<ref>[http://www.realitytvmagazine.com/blog/2006/05/american_idol_w.html American Idol: Will Bleep Controversy Send Paris Bennett Home?]</ref>
* Following [[Chris Daughtry]]'s elimination, many Idol fans claimed calls they dialed to Daughtry's line during the first few minutes of voting were misdirected. According to them, the first of his two numbers was answered by a recording of [[Katharine McPhee]] (who was also in the bottom two that night) giving thanks for their vote rather than Daughtry.<ref>http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12748906</ref> Others reported similar behavior dialing other lines, such as dialing [[Elliott Yamin]]'s line and hearing a recording of Daughtry giving thanks for their vote.<ref>[http://dialidol.com/asp/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=375 Elliott's votes going to Chris on DI]</ref>
* On Top 5 night (May 3), [[Elliott Yamin]] performed first, with [[Taylor Hicks]] going out last. Next week (May 10) [[Katharine McPhee]] went out last. It was expected that Yamin would go out last on Top 3 night (May 17), but he was again the first one to sing, losing what is called the "pimp spot", while Hicks was the last one to perform that night. Yamin's fans were distressed stating it was Yamin's right to go out last, while Hicks should have been first, and that the show producers arranged it to have Yamin eliminated next night (May 18), which actually happened.

==US Nielsen ratings==
