'''Penllyn Castle''' is a [[Norman architecture]] [[castle]], located in [[Cowbridge]], {{convert|4|mi}} south-east of [[Bridgend]], [[South Wales]].

Built by [[Robert Fitzhamon]] in 1135, the [[sheriff]] [[Earl of Gloucester]], it shares an oblong tower like contemporary [[Ogmore Castle]].<ref name=CasWal/><ref name=GatGaz/> The high-location was chosen as it gave clear-view over both the [[River Thaw]] and [[Ewenny River]] valleys.<ref name=GatGaz/>

Reportedly attacked by [[Owain Glynd<U+0175>r]],<ref name=GatGaz/> today the two surviving main walls of the original castle stand on the edge of a low cliff above the River Thaw. They include near the base six courses of "herringbone" masonry, a feature of early Norman construction. These add to the accademic theory that the castle was one of the first Norman structures built during Fitzhamon's occupation of Glamorgan.<ref name=CasWal/><ref name=GatGaz/>

In [[Tudor]] times, the Turbeville family built a manor house in the residual grounds, for which the former castle keep forms one corner. In the 1790s, a new manor house was built by Miss Gwinnett between 1780-1790, and the old house which now lies derlict converted into a stable block.<ref name=CasWal>{{cite web|url=http://www.castlewales.com/penllyn.html|title=Penllyn Castle|publisher=CastleWales.com|accessdate=19 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=GatGaz/>

In 1833, after his return from [[Boulogne]], [[France]], the castle was bought by John Homfray, the son of [[ironmaster]] [[Jeremiah Homfray]]. Using a "Tudorbethan"-style to match the previous works undertaken by the Turbeville family, he rebuilt the estate between 1846-60. This included the construction of a new entrance lodge, which today itself is a [[listed building|Grade I listed building]] as part of the estates group value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valeofglamorgan.gov.uk/files/Living/Planning/Policy/County_Treasures/Penllyn.pdf|title=County Treasures - Penllyn parish|publisher=Bridgend Borough Council|accessdate=19 July 2012}}</ref> Homfray demolished most of Miss Gwinnett's manor house, and rebuilt it in a contemporary Victorian architecture style with stucco-plaster walls, which itself today is only Grade II listed.<ref name=GatGaz>{{cite web|url=http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/Welshsites/451.html|title=Penllyn Castle|publisher=Gatehouse Gazetteer|accessdate=19 July 2012}}</ref>

Still owned to this day privately by descedents of the Homfray family, the castle is not accessible to the public.

In 2005, the semi-derelict castle stable block and manor house were both used as the main shooting location for ''[[Tooth and Claw (Doctor Who)|Tooth and Claw]]'', the second episode of the [[Doctor Who (series 2)|second series]] of the resurected [[BBC One]] television series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. The castle was set as a Victorian-era Scottish castle, home to some monks who were playing host to [[Queen Victoria]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwholocations.net/locations/penllyncastle|title=Penllyn Castle|publisher=DoctorWhoLocations.net|accessdate=19 July 2012}}</ref>
