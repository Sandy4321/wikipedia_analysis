'''Mario Gabriele Andretti''' (born [[February 28]], [[1940]] in Montona d'Istria, [[Italy]], now [[Motovun]], [[Croatia]]) is an [[Italian American]] racecar driver, and one of the most successful [[United States|Americans]] in the history of auto racing. 

He has competed and won in many different types of auto racing, including stock cars, [[midget car racing|midget cars]], [[Sprint car racing|sprint cars]], [[IndyCar]]s, [[Drag racing|drag racing cars]], [[sports car racing|sports cars]], and single-seater [[Formula One]] cars. During his career, Andretti won four [[Champ car|IndyCar]] titles, the [[1978 Formula One season|1978]] [[Formula One]] [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Championship]], and [[IROC VI]] (the 1978 - 1979 [[International Race of Champions|IROC]]). To date, he remains the only driver ever to win the [[Indianapolis 500]] ([[1969 Indianapolis 500|1969]]), [[NASCAR]]'s [[Daytona 500]] (1967), and the [[Formula One]] World Championship, and, along with [[Juan Pablo Montoya]], the only driver to have won a race in the NASCAR Cup series, Formula 1, and an Indianapolis 500. No American has won a Formula One race since Andretti at the [[1978 Dutch Grand Prix]].<ref>{{cite web | title=U.S. GRAND PRIX; Feel the need for Speed; Formula One racer tops

Andretti had a long career in racing.

The name ''Mario Andretti'' has become synonymous with speed in the United States,<ref name=C16>{{cite web | title=Mario Andretti: Living Legend (an interview) | work=C16 Magazine | url=http://www.c16mag.com/pacenote_item.aspx?cid=1410 | date=[[May 22]] [[2007]] | accessdate=2007-06-14 }}</ref> similar to [[Barney Oldfield]] in the early twentieth century and [[Stirling Moss]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

== Early life ==
Mario Andretti was born in the town of Montona d'Istria in the then [[Italy|Italian]] province of [[Istria]]. He was born with a twin brother, [[Aldo Andretti]]. Istria was occupied and annexed by [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] after [[World War II]]. His family, like many other Italian [[Istria]]ns, [[Istrian exodus|fled]] in 1948. They lived in a [[refugee camp]] in [[Lucca]] from 1948 to 1955. The five members of the Andretti family resettled in [[Nazareth, Pennsylvania|Nazareth]] in [[Pennsylvania]]'s [[Lehigh Valley]] in June 1955 with [[U.S. dollar|$]]125.<ref name=sportscentury /> Andretti became a [[naturalization|naturalized]] United States citizen in 1964.<ref name=ESPNclassic>{{cite-web | title=Andretti's only Indy 500 win came in 1969 | work=ESPN classic | url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/add_andretti_mario.html | accessdate=2007-04-21 }}</ref>

==Racing career==
===Childhood involvement in motorsports===
The twin's mother Rina said that when they were two years old, they would take pot lids out of the cupboards and run around the kitchen, going "Vroom, vroom," like they were driving cars - this before they had seen a car.<ref name=sportscentury /> In 1945, at the age of five, he and Aldo were racing their hand-crafted wooden cars through the steep streets of their hometown.<ref name=milwaukee>{{cite web | title=Appreciating Andretti | work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] | author=Garu D'Amato | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20030802/ai_n10897303 | date=2003-08-02 | accessdate=2007-04-12 }}</ref> Later, the brothers were hired by a garage to park cars. Andretti described the experience in his book ''What's It Like Out There'': "The first time I fired up a car, felt the engine shudder and the wheel come to life in my hands, I was hooked. It was a feeling I can't describe. I still get it every time I get into a race car."<ref>{{cite web | title=Mario Andretti - Began Racing In Italy | work=sports.jrank.org | url=http://sports.jrank.org/pages/146/Andretti-Mario-Began-Racing-in-Italy.html | accessdate=2007-04-12 }}</ref>  Andretti's first racing experience was in a new youth racing league called Formula Junior <!-- likely not the same series as the article in Wikipedia --> in [[Ancona, Italy]] when he was thirteen years old.<ref name=texaco>{{cite web | title=Texaco/Havoline CART History Mario Andretti | work=[[Texaco]]/[[Havoline]] | url=http://www.texacohavoline42.com/media/history/cart/mario_andretti.asp | accessdate=2007-04-12 }}</ref> He had a fond childhood memory of watching a stretch of the [[Mille Miglia]] race in 1954.

===Stockcar racing===
====Start in racing====
Mario and Aldo were surprised to find a half mile dirt racing track when they moved to Nazareth.<ref name=sportscentury /> The twins worked on a 1948 [[Hudson Hornet]] Sportsman [[stock car racing|stock car]] funded by money that they earned their uncle's garage in 1959.<ref name=sportscentury /> They took turns racing the car on oval [[dirt track racing|dirt tracks]] near Nazareth in 1959 in the old [[Hudson Motor Car|Hudson]].

Andretti competed in fourteen [[NASCAR]] Grand National/Winston Cup (now [[NEXTEL Cup]]) events in his career. He competed in [[Holman Moody]] cars for his final ten events.  Holman Moody was one of NASCAR's most successful teams at that time, as the team won NASCAR championships in 1968 and 1969 with driver [[David Pearson]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Holman Moody owner's statistics | work=racing-reference.info | url=http://www.racing-reference.info/owner?id=holmamo01 | accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref> Andretti won the [[1967 Daytona 500]] for [[Holman Moody]].<ref name=racing-reference>{{cite web | title=NASCAR and IROC driving statistics | work=racing-reference.info | url=http://racing-reference.info/driver?id=andrema01 | accessdate=2007-03-10 }}</ref>

====International Race of Champions====
Andretti was invited to race in six [[International Race of Champions]] (IROC) series in his career. His best years were his first three years. He finished second in the final points standings in [[IROC III]] (1975-1976) and [[IROC V]] (1977-1978). He won the [[IROC VI]] (1978-1979) points championship with finishes of third, first, and second. He won three races in twenty events.<ref name=racing-reference />

===Open wheel racing===
====Early open wheel racing====
Andretti raced [[sprint car racing|sprint cars]] in the [[United Racing Club]] on the eastern circuit from 1961 until mid-1962. <ref name=ESPNclassic /> Andretti moved to the [[American Racing Drivers Club]] [[midget car racing|midget car]] series in 1963, where he again toured the East coast of the U.S.<ref name=ESPNclassic /> He competed in over one hundred events in the season. Some days he competed and won three events in a single day.<ref name=8W />

====IndyCar career====
From 1956 to 1979, the top [[open wheel racing]] series in North America was the [[United States Automobile Club]] (USAC) National Championship. It was often referred to as [[Champ car]] racing, or Indycar racing, referring to the famous [[Indianapolis 500]] race which was the centerpiece of the championship. The races were run on a mixture of paved and dirt ovals, and in later years also included some road courses. Andretti made his Champ Car debut in 1964, taking over the driving duties for the injured [[Chuck Hulse]] at [[Trenton, New Jersey]]. He started sixteenth and finishing eleventh for [[Al Dean]]'s team. The move teamed Andretti with [[Crew chief|chief mechanic]] Clint Brawner, and the two quickly forged a winning combination. Andretti won his first championship car race at the Hoosier Grand Prix in 1965. His third place finish at the [[1965 Indianapolis 500]] earned him the race's [[List of Indianapolis 500 Rookies of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] award, and helped Andretti win the series championship. He was the youngest national champion in series history at age 25.<ref name=8W /> He repeated as series champion in 1966.<ref name=texaco /> Andretti finished second in the IndyCars in 1967 and 1968. He also won a single non-championship [[drag racing|drag race]] in 1967 in a [[Ford Mustang]].

Andretti won nine races in 1969, the [[1969 Indianapolis 500]], and the season championship. He also won the [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb]], which was part of the USAC National Championship.<ref name=ESPN /> He was named [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Wide World of Sports]] Athlete of the Year. Between 1966 and 1969 he won 29 of 85 USAC championship races.<ref name=sportscentury />

While continuing to compete in the USAC National Championship, Andretti also competed two full seasons in the North American [[Formula 5000]] series in 1973 and 1974, and finished second in the championship in both seasons.<ref name=sportscentury /> He also competed in USAC's dirt track division in 1974, and won the dirt track championship while competing in both series.<ref name=sportscentury />

==== Formula One career ====

[[Image:Lotus79.jpg|left|thumb|Andretti's [[Lotus 77]] racecar]]
[[Formula One]] is the highest form of open wheel racing sanctioned by the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA), motorsport's international governing body. Although originating in Europe, by the 1960s it included races worldwide. At Andretti's first Indianapolis 500, in [[1965 Indianapolis 500|1965]], he met [[Colin Chapman]], owner of the [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] Formula One team, who was running eventual race winner [[Jim Clark]]'s car. Andretti told Chapman of his ambition to compete in Formula One and was told "When you're ready, call me."<ref>{{Cite  journal  | last = Taylor  | first = Simon  | title = Lunch with ... Mario Andretti  | journal = Motorsport  | volume = LXXXIII | pages = 36  | month = March  | year = 2007 }}</ref> By 1968 Andretti felt he was ready. Chapman gave him a car, and the young American took the pole position on his debut at the [[1968 United States Grand Prix]] at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]].<ref>{{Cite  journal  | last = Taylor  | first = Simon  | title = Lunch with ... Mario Andretti  | journal = Motorsport  | volume = LXXXIII | pages = 33 - 42  | month = March  | year = 2007 }}</ref>

Andretti drove sporadically in Formula One over the next four years for Lotus, [[March Engineering|March]], and [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], while continuing to focus on his racing career in America. At the [[1971 South African Grand Prix]], on his debut for Ferrari,  he won his first Grand Prix. Three weeks later, at the non-championship Questor Grand Prix in the U.S., he brought the Italian team a second victory.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Questor Grand Prix | work=forix.com | author=Tom Prankerd 
| url=http://www.forix.com/8w/questor.html | accessdate=2007-04-15 }}</ref>

It wasn't until [[1975 Formula One season|1975]] that Andretti drove a full Formula One season, for the American [[Parnelli]] team. The team was new to Formula One, although it had been successful in both [[Formula 5000]] and [[Championship Car|IndyCar]] racing in America with Andretti driving. The team had run Andretti in the two North American end-of-season races in 1974 with promising results. Andretti qualified fourth and led the [[1975 Spanish Grand Prix]] for nine laps before his suspension failed. He scored five championship points in the season. Andretti continued to compete in IndyCar, missing two Formula One races in the middle of the season to do so.<ref>{{cite book | last = Gill | first = Barrie (ed.) | coauthors = | title = The World Championship 1975 - [[John Player & Sons|John Player]] Motorsport yearbook 1976 | publisher = Queen Anne Press Ltd. | date = 1976 | id = ISBN 0-362-00254-1 |pages=pp.37 & 120 }}</ref>

When the Parnelli team pulled out of Formula One after two races of the [[1976 Formula One season|1976 season]], Andretti returned to Chapman's Lotus team, for whom he had already driven at the season-opening [[1976 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian Grand Prix]]. Lotus was then at a low point, having failed to produce a competitive car to replace 1970's [[Lotus 72]]. Andretti's ability at developing a racing car contributed to Lotus' return to the front of the Formula One grid, culminating in lapping the field in his victory at the season ending race at the [[Fuji Speedway|Mount Fuji]] circuit in Japan. Since mid-1975 Lotus had been developing the use of [[ground effect]], shaping the underside of the car to generate [[downforce]] with little penalizing [[drag (physics)|drag]]. For his part, Andretti worked at setting up his cars for the races, exploiting subtle differences in tire size ('stagger') and suspension set up ('cross weighting') on each side of the car to optimize it for each track, an approach imported from his extensive oval racing experience in the United States.<ref>{{cite book | last = Nye | first = Doug | coauthors = | title = Autocourse History of the Grand Prix car 1966 - 1985 | publisher = Hazleton Publishing | date = 1986 | id = ISBN 0-905-138-37-6 |pages=pp.95-97 }}</ref> In 1977, at [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], he became the only American to win the [[United States Grand Prix West]]<ref>{{cite web | title=United States Grand Prix history | publisher=[[Formula One]] | url=http://www.formula1.com/news/features/2004/6/1739.html | accessdate=2007-07-12 }}</ref>  in the [[Lotus 78]] "wing car", which proved to be the most competitive car of 1977.<ref name=ddavid>{{cite web | title=Lotus - Ford 79 | url=http://www.ddavid.com/formula1/lotus79.htm | accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> Despite winning four races, more than any other driver, reliability problems and collisions with other drivers meant he finished only third in the championship.<ref name=ddavid /> The following year, [[Lotus 79]] exploited ground effect even further and Andretti took the title with six wins.<ref name=ddavid /> He clinched the championship at the [[Italian Grand Prix]].<ref name=sportscentury /> There was no championship celebration because his teammate and close friend [[Ronnie Peterson]] died that day from injuries suffered in a crash in the first lap of the race.<ref name=sportscentury />

Andretti would find little success after 1978 in Formula One - he failed to win another grand prix. He had a difficult year in 1979, as the new [[Lotus 80]] was not competitive, and the team had to rely on the Lotus 79 which had been overtaken by the second generation of ground effect cars.<ref>Nye (1986) p.100</ref> In 1980, he was paired with Italian [[Elio de Angelis]], and briefly with the young [[Nigel Mansell]], but the team was again unsuccessful.<ref>Nye (1986) p.196</ref>

Andretti had an unsuccessful [[1981 Formula One season|1981]] with the [[Alfa Romeo (Formula One)|Alfa Romeo]] team. Like other drivers of the period he did not like the [[ground effect]] cars of the time: "the cars were getting absurd, really crude, with no suspension movement whatever. It was toggle switch driving with no need for any kind of delicacy...it made leaving Formula One a lot easier than it would have been."<ref>{{cite book | last = Roebuck | first = Nigel | coauthors = | title = Grand Prix Greats | publisher = Patrick Stephens Ltd | date = 1986 | id = ISBN 0-85059-792-7 | pages=p.24}}</ref> The next year Andretti raced once for the [[Williams F1|Williams]] team, after their driver [[Carlos Reutemann]] suddenly quit, before replacing the seriously injured [[Didier Pironi]] at Ferrari for the last two races of the year. Suspension failure dropped him out of the last race of the season, but at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza he took the pole position and finished third in the race.<ref>Roebuck (1986) pp.21-22</ref>

==== Return to IndyCar racing ====
Andretti had continued to race, and occasionally win, in the USAC National Championship during his time in the Formula One world championship. In 1979 a new organization, [[Championship Auto Racing Teams]], had set up the Indycar world series as a rival to the USAC National Championships that Andretti had won three times in the 1960s. The new series had rapidly become the top open wheel racing series in North America.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hamilton (ed.) | first = Maurice | coauthors = | title = Autocourse 1983 - 1984 | publisher = Hazleton Publishing | date = 1983 | id = ISBN 0-905138-25-2 |pages=p.219 }}</ref>

It was to this arena that Andretti returned full time in 1982, driving for [[Patrick Racing]]. In 1983 he joined the new [[Newman/Haas Racing]] team, set up by [[Carl Haas]] and actor [[Paul Newman]] using cars built by British company [[Lola Racing Cars|Lola]]. Andretti took the team's first win at [[Road America|Elkhart Lake]] in [[1983 CART World Series Season|1983]].<ref>Hamilton (ed.) (1983) p.226</ref> He won the pole for nine of sixteen events in [[1984 CART World Series Season|1984]], and claimed his fourth [[American Championship Car Racing|Champ Car]] title at the age of 44. He edged out [[Tom Sneva]] by 13 points. It was the first series title for the second year team.

Mario's son Michael joined Newman/Haas in 1989. Together, they made history as the first father/son team to compete in both [[IMSA GT Championship|IMSA GT]] and Champ Car racing,<ref name=texaco /> as for the former, it was their fourth time in an endurance race together as co-drivers. Mario finished seventh in points for the 1991 season, the year that Michael won the championship. Mario's last victory in IndyCar racing came in 1993 at [[Phoenix International Raceway]], the year that Michael left Newman/Haas to race in Formula One. The win made Mario the oldest recorded winner in an IndyCar event (53 years, 34 days old).<ref>{{cite-web | title=The Andrettis | work=www.superspeedway.com | url=http://www.superspeedway.com/eng/andretti.html | accessdate=2007-02-28 }}</ref> Andretti qualified on the pole at the [[Michigan 500]] later that year with a speed of 234.275 [[miles per hour|mph]] (377.028 [[kilometers per hour|kph]]). The speed was a new closed course world record.<ref name=8W>{{cite-web | title=THE CHAMPIONS / Mario Andretti | work=8W | author=Mattijs Diepraam, Rainer Nyberg  | url=http://www.forix.com/8w/andretti.html | accessdate=2007-06-14 }}</ref> Andretti's final season, in 1994, was dubbed "The Arrivederci Tour." He raced in the last of his 407 Indy car races that September.

==== Indianapolis 500 ====
[[Image:Mario and aldo.jpg|thumb|right|Mario (left) and his brother [[Aldo Andretti|Aldo]] (right) at pole day for the [[2007 Indianapolis 500]]]]
Andretti won once at the [[Indianapolis 500]] in 29 attempts. Andretti has had so many incidents and near victories at the track that critics have dubbed the family's performance after Mario's [[1969 Indianapolis 500]] victory the "[[Andretti Curse]]".<ref name=KnightRidder>{{cite web | title=What curse? Andretti is back at Indy  | work=[[Knight Ridder]] | author=Steve Crowe | url=http://archive.southcoasttoday.com/daily/05-01/05-26-01/c05sp125.htm | accessdate=2007-07-11 }}</ref> <ref>{{cite web | title='I didn't miss this': Andretti survives difficult weekend to get in field | date = [[May 14]] [[2001]] | work=[[CNN]]/[[Sports Illustrated]] | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/motorsports/2001/indy500/news/2001/05/14/andretti_difficulty_ap/ | accessdate=2007-07-11 }}</ref>

Mario finished all 500 miles just five times, including his [[1969 Indianapolis 500]] victory. Andretti was the first driver to exceed 200 miles per hour while practicing for the [[1977 Indianapolis 500]].<ref name=ESPNclassic />

Andretti finished second in the [[1981 Indianapolis 500]] by eight seconds behind [[Bobby Unser]]. The following day Unser was penalized one lap for passing cars under a caution flag, and Andretti was declared the winner. Unser and his car owner [[Roger Penske]] appealed the race stewarts' decision. USAC overturned the one lap penalty four months later, and penalized Unser with a [[U.S. dollar|$]]40,000 fine.

In the [[1985 Indianapolis 500]], he was passed by [[Danny Sullivan]]. Sullivan subsequently spun in front of Andretti, pitted on his own caution, and then passed Mario again to go on for the win. Andretti dominated the [[1987 Indianapolis 500]] testing, led for 170 of the first 177 laps of the race, but his race was ended with electrical failure before the finish on lap 200. Andretti suffered broken ankles in the [[1992 Indianapolis 500]] when he crashed hard in turn four during the race. Andretti's last race at Indy was the [[1994 Indianapolis 500]].<ref name=KnightRidder /> 

After retiring, Andretti was testing for his son Michael's IndyCar on [[April 24]] [[2003]] in place of the injured [[Tony Kanaan]] at Indianapolis. At 5:58 pm -- two minutes before the scheduled end of the session -- Andretti powered out of the first turn onto the "south chute" of the circuit. In his path lay a chunk of debris from [[Kenny Brack]]'s car, which had crashed seconds earlier. The object forced the nose of Andretti's car to become airborne, and Andretti's car went into a rapid double reverse somersault at speeds estimated to be above 200 miles per hour. Television footage from a local TV station's helicopter showed that the car was nearly high enough to clear the debris fence mounted atop the circuit's outer retaining wall. Andretti's car fell back to earth, having been slowed by its mid-air tumble, and slid to a stop. Luckily, the car landed right side up and Andretti walked away from the crash with very minor injuries.<ref name=8W />

===Sports cars===
Andretti won three [[12 Hours of Sebring]] endurance races (1967, 1970, 1972),<ref name=sportscentury /> and the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] in 1972. In early sportscar races he competed for the Holman Moody team, but later often drove for [[Ferrari]]. In 1972, driving for the Italian Ferrari team, he shared wins in the three North American rounds of the championship and at [[Brands Hatch]] in the UK, contributing to Ferrari's dominant victory in [[1972 World Sportscar Championship season|that year's World Championship for Makes]]. He also competed in the popular North American [[Can-Am]] series in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

====Le Mans====
Andretti competed at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] in four decades. In [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans|1966]] he shared a [[Holman Moody]] [[Ford GT40|Ford MKII]] with [[Lucien Bianchi]]. They retired after their car dropped a valve at 10:30p.m.<ref>{{cite web | title=Le Mans 1966 | work=GT40.org | url=http://www.gt40.org.uk/Le%20Mans/1966.htm | accessdate=2007-06-15 }}</ref> In [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans|1967]] his front brake locked, causing him to crash his [[Holman Moody]] [[Ford GT40|Ford MKIV]] at the Esses. His teammates, [[Jo Schlesser]] and [[Roger McCluskey]], crashed while managing to avoid Andretti's GT40. McCluskey pulled Andretti to safety, and Andretti was taken to hospital for [[X-ray]]s.<ref>{{cite web | title=Ford Again at Le Mans

Andretti did not return to Le Mans until his full time Formula One career was over. In 1982, he partnered with son Michael in a Mirage M12 Ford. They qualified in ninth place, but the pair found their car being removed from the starting grid 80 minutes before the start of the race,<ref name="ian">Ian Briggs. (1991), ''Endurance Racing 1981-1991'': Osprey Automotive. ISBN 1-85532-228-5</ref> as an official discovered an oil cooler that was mounted behind the gearbox, which was against the rules. The car had passed initial inspection four days before the race.<ref name="ian" /> Despite protests and complaints, the Andretti's entry was removed altogether, replaced by a [[Porsche 924]] Carrera GTR. Their return in the [[1983 24 Hours of Le Mans|following year]] was more successful as they finished third. The father/son team returned in {{24hLM|1988}} with John Andretti. They finished sixth in a factory [[Porsche 962]]. Following Mario's retirement from full-time racing, he decided on a return to the circuit to add a Le Mans victory to his achievements. He returned in {{24hLM|1995}} with a second place finish. He said in a 2006 interview that he feels that the [[Courage Comp<U+00E9>tition]] team "lost [the 1995] race five times over" through poor organization. He had unsuccessful efforts in the following years with a thirteenth place in {{24hLM|1996}}, and then a DNF (Did Not Finish) for {{24hLM|1997}}. Andretti's final appearance at Le Mans was at the [[2000 24 Hours of Le Mans|2000 race]], six years after his retirement from full-time racing, when he drove the [[Panoz]] LMP-1 Roadster-S at the age of 60, finishing 16th.<ref>{{Cite  journal  | last = Watkins  | first = Gary  | title = The dream isn't over  | journal = Motorsport  | volume = LXXXII No. 6 | pages = 39 - 42  | month = June  | year = 2006 }}</ref>

=== Awards and honors ===
In 2000, the [[Associated Press]] and RACER magazine named him "Driver of the Century."<ref name=CCWScommendatore>{{cite web | title=Legendary race car driver Mario Andretti received commendatore honor from the Republic of Italy | work=[[Champ Car World Series]] | date = [[October 24]] [[2006]] | url=http://www.champcarworldseries.com/News/Article.asp?ID=11020 | accessdate=2007-07-11 }}</ref> The same year, he was inducted into the [[International Motorsports Hall of Fame]].<ref name=IMHoF /> He was inducted into the United States [[National Sprint Car Hall of Fame & Museum|National Sprint Car Hall of Fame]] in 1996,<ref name=NSCHoF>{{cite web | title=inductees | work=[[National Sprint Car Hall of Fame & Museum|National Sprint Car Hall of Fame]] | format = PDF | url=http://www.sprintcarhof.com/FileGet.aspx?ID=144 | accessdate=2007-07-10 }}</ref> and the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 1990.<ref name=mshf />

==Mario Andretti Grand Prix of Road America==
Mario was instrumental in keeping championship car racing at [[Road America]]. [[Champ Car|CART]] severed its ties with the track as a legal resolution of payment issues from the 2002 and 2003 series [[Champcar Grand Prix of Road America|events]] at the track. Andretti was an intermediary between CART President Chris Pook and Road America President George Bruggenthies. After six weeks both sides came to terms and signed a two year contract. The event was renamed the "Mario Andretti Grand Prix of Road America".<ref name=milwaukee />

==Elder of Andretti racing family==
[[Image:MarioAndrettiAndJohnAndrettiMay2007.jpg|thumb|right|Mario (left) with nephew [[John Andretti|John]] (right) at the [[2007 Indianapolis 500]]]]
Both of Mario Andretti's sons, [[Michael Andretti|Michael]] and [[Jeff Andretti|Jeff]], were auto racers. Michael followed in his father's footsteps by winning the IndyCar title. In 1991, the Andrettis were joined by Mario's nephew [[John Andretti]]. The Andrettis became the first family to have four relatives compete in the same series.<ref name=ESPN /> Mario's grandson Marco completed his first full season in the [[Indy Racing League]] (IRL) in 2006, driving for his father Michael's [[Andretti Green Racing]] team. Marco finished second in the [[2006 Indianapolis 500]], became the first third-generation-recipient of the race's [[List of Indianapolis 500 Rookies of the Year|Rookie of the Year Award]].

==Later life==
Mario and his wife Dee Ann live near their son Michael in mansions overlooking the town of Nazareth, Pennsylvania, Mario's home city since the 1950s. Dee Ann is a native of Nazareth who taught English to Andretti in 1961.<ref name=ESPNclassic />

Andretti has kept active after his retirement from full-time racing. He makes numerous speaking engagements before corporate audiences. He is a spokesman for long time sponsors [[Texaco]]/[[Havoline]] and [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]]. He is also occasionally a spokesman for the [[Champ Car|Champ Car World Series]], although he frequently attends IRL races watching Marco compete. Andretti is [[Chairman|vice chairman]] of a [[winery]] named Andretti Winery in [[Napa Valley, California]]. Andretti has a chain of gasoline stations and a distributorship, a car dealership, car washes, car-care productes, [[karting|go-kart]] tracks, a clothing line, video games and replica cars. He also test drives cars for [[Road & Track]] and [[Car and Driver ]] magazines.<ref name=C16 />

In July 2006 Mario took part in the Bullrun race across America.<ref name=C16 /> The first pitstop was at the [[Pocono Raceway]] (in Andretti's state of Pennsylvania), with Gate #5 aptly named Andretti Road.
