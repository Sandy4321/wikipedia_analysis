'''Incarnation Camp''' is a nonprofit, traditional [[Summer Camp]] located in [[Essex, Connecticut]]. The camp was established in 1886. It is the oldest, co-ed, continually operated summer camp in the USA.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. OLDEST CAMPS|url=http://www.ottertooth.com/Camps/camps-us.htm|accessdate=21 January 2014}}</ref>
== Early history ==

In 1886, the [[Church of the Incarnation, Episcopal (Manhattan)|The Church of the Incarnation in Manhattan]], located on Madison Ave. and 35th Street, NYC, rented a farmhouse in Mohegan Lake from R. Horne as part of a <U+201C>fresh air<U+201D> program sponsored by the New York Tribune. Children from the tenements of New York<U+2019>s lower East Side, many of whom immigrated here from Europe with their families during the 1880<U+2019>s,  were taken from often squalid living conditions to spend a week in the fresh country air of upstate New York. The Rev. Arthur Brooks of Incarnation persuaded his parishioners to rent the furnished farmhouse, and on June 19, 1886 25 young boys and girls from the east side of Manhattan became the first campers. Each summer, some 230 children benefited from the experience.

Eight years later, in 1894, Incarnation parish raised $7000 for the purchase of the farmhouse, plus an adjacent barn and a total of five acres <U+201C>to be used for the purposes of a summer home for the poor of the parish.<U+201D> Also that year, a parishioner made a contribution to have a swimming pool installed, complete with pumps that replenished it with water from Lake Mohegan, half a mile away. A second home was built in 1895, called Brooks Cottage, which was used specifically for the parish<U+2019>s Bethlehem Day Nursery.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kiederer|first=Linda|title=INCARNATION CAMP 1886-1924|url=http://yorktownhistory.org/wp-content/archives/homepages/april01.htm|accessdate=21 January 2014}}</ref>
In 1925 Incarnation Camp was relocated to St. Johnsland in [[Kings Park, New York]]<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Incarnation Conference Center|url=http://www.incarnationcenter.org/history.htm|accessdate=21 January 2014}}</ref>
== Later history ==

In 1929, Incarnation Camp was relocated to its permanent site on the border between [[Ivoryton]] and [[Deep River, Connecticut|Deep River]] in Connecticut.

In 1949, Incarnation Camp was incorporated as a non-profit. The first Chairman of the Board was John A. Bell.

The lake at the center of the camp property was created in 1873, when the Clarke family which owned the land at the time allowed the Comstock, Cheney and Co. piano makers to build a 20-foot dam that impounded a brook flowing through the property.

Water flowing from the lake powered the main shop of the company, which became Pratt, Read and Co. after a 1936 merger with a similar operation in Deep River.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stannard|first=Charles|title=Finding Peace In Wooded Connecticut|url=http://articles.courant.com/2001-09-04/community/hc-attractions-ivorytonessex0904_1_summer-camp-wooded-connecticut-deep-river|accessdate=21 January 2014}}</ref>
In early June of 1982 the dam which held the mile long Bushy Hill Lake gave way due to heavy rain and drained the lake.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Woodside|first=Christine|title=The 100 Year Storm|journal=Connecticut Woodlands|date=Spring 2008|year=2008|volume=73|issue=1|pages=8-9|url=http://www.ctwoodlands.org/docs/woodlands/woodlands_2008_spring.pdf|accessdate=21 January 2014}}</ref> That summer the camp operated successfully using remote swimming and boating facilities at Lake Messerschmidt. The following year Incarnation Camp was able to rebuild the dam because of a massive fund raising effort garnering donations from alumni and the local community including [[Katherine Hepburn]] <ref>{{cite news|title=Connecticut Journal|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/17/nyregion/connecticut-journal.html|accessdate=21 January 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 April 1983}}</ref>

== Programs ==

Incarnation Camp hosts Pequot Sherwood Day Camp (co-ed [[day camp]] for campers aged 6-13), Pequot Sherwood Overnight Camp (co-ed [[Sleepaway Camp|sleepaway camp]] camp for campers aged 7-13), and Pioneer Village (co-ed [[Sleepaway Camp|sleepaway camp]] camp for campers aged 14-16)

== Naming ==

Although founded originally and currently known as "Incarnation Camp", Incarnation has also been known as: "ECCC", & "The Episcopal Camp & Conference Center".

== Camp life ==

Campers at Incarnation range from age 6 to 16. Overnight campers sleep in 16 foot platform tents with their tent mates and counselors. Meals are served in Gibney Dining Hall.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gibney Dining Hall|url=http://www.incarnationcenter.org/accomodations.htm#Gibney_|accessdate=21 January 2014}}</ref>
If a Pioneer Village (see Programs, below) graduate is 16 or older at the start of the summer season, they may apply to become a [[Counselor-in-Training|Counselor's Assistant]] (CA) in an area of their choice. Many CAs go on to become Counselors once they are 18 or older.
