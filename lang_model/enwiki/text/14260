The '''Milbanke Sound Group''', also called the '''Milbanke Sound Cones''', is an enigmatic group of five small [[basalt]]ic volcanoes in the [[Kitimat Ranges]] of the [[Coast Mountains]] in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. Named for [[Milbanke Sound]], this [[volcanic group]] straddles on at least four small uninhabited islands, including [[Swindle Island|Swindle]], [[Price Island|Price]], [[Lady Douglas Island|Lady Douglas]] and [[Lake Island]]. Not much is known about this group of volcanoes and they remain undated.<ref name="JK"/> However, they all likely formed in the past 10,000 years after the [[last glacial period]] as evidenced by a small amount of erosion.<ref name="KL"/> The age of the most recent volcanic activity is also unknown.<ref name="SI"/> Most of the Milbanke Sound Cones are covered by mature [[forest]]. [[Kitasu Hill]] and [[Helmet Peak (British Columbia)|Helmet Peak]] are the only two cones that are officially named.

This group of volcanoes is unlike many other volcanic groups in Canada as it resides on islands instead of on the [[mainland]]. The volcanoes form a northwest-southeast trend along the [[British Columbia Coast]]. To the west the Milbanke Sound Group is bounded by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and elsewhere it is surrounded by adjacent islands that form an [[archipelago]]. Although not related, the Milbanke Sound Group is close to the remains of a much older magmatic feature that was formed during the [[Tertiary]] period.<ref name="SI"/>

==Geology==
===Volcanoes===
Just south of Kitasu Bay on the southwestern shore of Swindle Island, Kitasu Hill rises with an elevation of {{Convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a [[topographic prominence]] of {{Convert|230|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This is a small symmetrical [[monogenetic volcanic field|monogenetic]] [[cinder cone]] and the best preserved volcano associated with the Milbanke Sound Group.<ref name="KL"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Kitasu Hill|work=Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes|publisher=[[Geological Survey of Canada]]|date=2009-03-10|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/volcano_e.php?id=avb_khl_031|accessdate=2010-01-30}}</ref> It is the northernmost and most prominent volcano of the Milbanke Sound Cones with a circular [[volcanic crater]] at its summit.<ref name="KL"/> The volcano produced basaltic lava flows that extend to the north.<ref name="SI">{{cite gvp|vnum=1200-12-|title=Milbanke Sound Group|accessdate=2010-01-30}}</ref> Subaerial [[tephra]] and [[volcanic bomb]]s are the main volcanics comprising the volcano.<ref name="KL"/> These volcanics surround eroded remains of the basalt lava flows and are composed of the mineral [[olivine]].<ref name="KL"/> Kitasu Hill rests on till that overlies glacially scoured bedrock.<ref name="JK"/>

Near the northeastern shore of Price Island, a small eroded monogenetic cinder cone composed of basalt is covered by mature forest.<ref name="JK"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Price Island|work=Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes|publisher=[[Geological Survey of Canada]]|date=2009-03-10|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/volcano_e.php?id=avb_pis_029|accessdate=2010-01-30}}</ref> It has an elevation of {{Convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} and is the source of a basaltic lava flow.<ref name="JK"/><ref name="AQ">{{cite gvp|vnum=1200-12-&volpage=synsub|title=Milbanke Sound Group|accessdate=2010-01-30}}</ref> This lava flow extends down to the northeastern shoreline of Price Island where it covers beach gravel.<ref name="JK"/>

Helmet Peak on the northern end of Lake Island just off the southwestern side of the [[Don Peninsula]] is a steep-sided monogenetic cinder cone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Helmet Peak|work=Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes|publisher=[[Geological Survey of Canada]]|date=2009-03-10|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/volcano_e.php?id=avb_hpk_030|accessdate=2010-01-30}}</ref><ref>{{BCGNIS|29287|Helmet Peak}}</ref> It is composed of welded [[volcanic block]]s and basaltic feeder [[dike (geology)|dikes]].<ref name="JK"/> With an elevation of {{Convert|335|m|ft|abbr=on}}, Helmet Peak is the highest volcano in the Milbanke Sound Group.<ref name="KL"/> During its eruption, basaltic [[tuff]] breccia was sent throughout the surrounding landscape that deposited on glaciated granitic rock and unconsolidated beach gravel near the volcano.<ref name="JK"/> This basaltic tuff breccia covers parts of Lake Island and nearby Lady Douglas Island.<ref name="KL"/> Blocks of basement [[granodiorite]], some up to {{Convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, are randomly suspended within the breccia.<ref name="JK"/> Basalt on Lake Island is characterized by abundant {{Convert|0.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|1|cm|in|abbr=on}} [[labradorite]] and [[clinopyroxene]] [[phenocryst]]s.<ref name="JK"/>

At the southern end of the Milbanke Sound Group, a small monogenetic cinder cone with an elevation of {{Convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} resides on Dufferin Island.<ref name="AQ"/><ref name="GH"/> It sent basaltic lava flows to the north where they reached the island's shoreline to cover beach gravel.<ref name="JK"/> Since its formation, the cinder cone has been eroded and covered by forest.<ref name="GH">{{cite web|title=Dufferin Island|work=Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes|publisher=[[Geological Survey of Canada]]|date=2009-03-10|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/volcano_e.php?id=avb_dis_028|accessdate=2010-01-30}}</ref> Finngal Island, south of Dufferin Island, contains one or more basaltic lava flows that form well-preserved columar jointing.<ref name="KL"/><ref name="KR">{{cite web|title=Finngal Island|work=Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes|publisher=[[Geological Survey of Canada]]|date=2009-03-10|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/volcano_e.php?id=avb_fis_033|accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref> Like other volcanic deposits in the Milbanke Sound Group, little is known about these lava flows.<ref name="KR"/>

===Origins===
The relationship of the Milbanke Sound Cones and to other volcanoes throughout British Columbia is not clear.<ref name="KL">{{cite web|title=Anahim Volcanic Belt: Milbanke Sound cones|work=Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes|publisher=[[Geological Survey of Canada]]|date=2009-04-14|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/feature_milbanke_e.php|accessdate=2010-01-30}}</ref> In some classifications, they are grouped with the [[Anahim Volcanic Belt]] because they are parallel with its east-west trend.<ref name="KL"/> However, this grouping is not widely accepted because the volcanoes are much younger than other magmatic features at the western end of the Anahim Volcanic Belt.<ref name="KL"/> The cause of this significant age change is because the Anahim Volcanic Belt has its origins from the [[North American Plate]] moving over the hypothesized [[Anahim hotspot]].<ref name="KL"/> This is a [[mantle plume]] that is likely responsible for [[volcanism]] throughout the Anahim Volcanic Belt.<ref name="KL"/> Individual Anahim volcanoes generally become older west of [[Nazko Cone]], indicating that the North American Plate is moving in a westerly direction with respect to the [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]], carrying the volcanoes along with it at a rate of {{Convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|3.3|cm|in|abbr=on}} per year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bevier|first=Mary Lou|coauthors=Armstrong, Richard Lee; Souther, J. G.|title=Miocene peralkaline volcanism in west-central British Columbia <U+2014> Its temporal and plate-tectonics setting|journal=Geology|volume=7|issue=8|pages=389<U+2013>392|publisher=[[Astrophysics Data System]]|date=Augest 1979|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979Geo.....7..389B|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1979)7<389:MPVIWB>2.0.CO;2|accessdate=2008-02-02|year = 1979}}</ref> Thus the hotspot model can not be used to explain the formation of the Milbanke Sound Group.<ref name="KL"/> However, the volcanic group is near the remnants of a 14&nbsp;to 12&nbsp;million year old magmatic feature that is interpreted to define the westernmost end of the Anahim hotspot track.<ref name="JK">{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Charles A.|coauthors=Kienle, J<U+00FC>rgen|chapter=|pages=130|title=Volcanoes of North America: United States and Canada|year=2001|edition=|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=[[Cambridge]], [[England]]|isbn=9780521438117|oclc=27910629}}</ref>

A possible explanation for the origin of the Milbanke Sound Group is that it reflects a northern extension of the north-west trending [[subduction]]-related [[Garibaldi Volcanic Belt]] further south.<ref name="KL"/> This in turn is a segment of the [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade Volcanic Arc]] in the [[United States]], which includes [[Mount Baker]] and [[Mount St. Helens]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Garibaldi Volcanic Belt|work=Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes|publisher=[[Geological Survey of Canada]]|date=2009-04-02|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/belt_garibaldi_e.php|accessdate=2010-02-04}}</ref> However, there is currently not enough data to support this suggestion.<ref name="KL"/> Its origins might also result from other tectonic processes that are currently not understood.<ref name="KL"/>

==Monitoring==
Currently, the Milbanke Sound Cones are not monitored closely enough by the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] to ascertain how active their magma chambers are.<ref name="ZPQ">{{cite web|title=Monitoring volcanoes|work=Volcanoes of Canada|publisher=[[Geological Survey of Canada]]|date=2008-02-12|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/mon_e.php|accessdate=2009-01-22}}</ref> An existing netwok of [[seismometer|seismographs]] has been established to monitor earthquakes, but is too far away to provide a good indication of what is happening beneath the cones.<ref name="ZPQ"/> It may sense an increase in activity if a volcano becomes very restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption.<ref name="ZPQ"/> It might detect activity only once a volcano has started erupting.<ref name="ZPQ"/>

The [[Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan]], Canada's volcanic emergency notification program, was established to outline the notification procedure of some of the main agencies that would be involved in response to a volcanic eruption in Canada, an eruption close to Canada's borders, or an eruption significant enough to have an effect on Canada and its people.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan: Western Canada|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]]|date=2008-05-01|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/pdf/ivenp_e.pdf|format=PDF|page=7|accessdate=2009-02-19}}</ref> It focuses primarily on aviation safety because jet aircraft can quickly enter areas of volcanic ash.<ref name="HEPO">{{cite web|title=Volcanoes|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]]|date=2007-09-05|url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/environment/naturalhazards/volcanoes/1|accessdate=2009-01-22}}</ref> The program notifies all impacted agencies that have to deal with volcanic events.<ref name="HEPO"/> Aircraft are rerouted away from hazardous ash and people on the ground are notified of potential ash fall.<ref name="HEPO"/>
