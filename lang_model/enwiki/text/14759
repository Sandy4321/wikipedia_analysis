'''Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.''' (born '''Leslie Lynch King, Jr.''') (July 14, 1913{{ndash}} December 26, 2006) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|38th]] [[President of the United States]], serving from 1974 to 1977, and the [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|40th]] [[Vice President of the United States]] serving from 1973 to 1974. As the first person appointed to the vice-presidency under the terms of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]], when he became President upon [[Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon's]] resignation on August 9, 1974, he also became the only President of the United States who was elected neither President nor Vice-President.

Before ascending to the vice-presidency, Ford served nearly 25 years as [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] from [[Michigan's 5th congressional district]], eight of them as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Leader]].

As President, Ford signed the [[Helsinki Accords]], marking a move toward [[d<U+00E9>tente]] in the [[Cold War]]. With the [[Fall of Saigon|conquest of South Vietnam]] by North Vietnam nine months into his presidency, US involvement in [[Vietnam]] essentially [[Vietnam War#Exit of the Americans: 1973<U+2013>1975|came to an end]].  Domestically, Ford presided over what was then the worst economy since the [[Great Depression]], with growing [[inflation]] and a [[recession]] during his tenure.<ref name="'70s">{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|coauthors= |year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0465041957|page= 14|pages= |url= }}</ref> One of his more controversial acts was to grant a [[presidential pardon]]  to President [[Richard Nixon]] for his role in the [[Watergate scandal]]. During Ford<U+2019>s incumbency, foreign policy was characterized in procedural terms by the increased role Congress began to play, and by the corresponding curb on the powers of the President.<!-- (Please keep hidden until fully developed below) "This was made clear by developments in two major substantive issues during Ford<U+2019>s presidency: the Cyprus crisis and Arab Israeli relations." --><ref name="Lenczowski">{{cite book|author=[[George Lenczowski]]|title=American Presidents, and the Middle East|year=1990|isbn=0822309726|pages=142-143|publisher=Duke University Press}}</ref>  In [[1976]], Ford narrowly defeated [[Ronald Reagan]] for the Republican nomination, but ultimately lost the [[United States presidential election, 1976|presidential election]] to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Jimmy Carter]].

Following his years as president, Ford remained active in the Republican Party. After experiencing health problems and being admitted to the hospital four times in 2006, Ford [[Death and state funeral of Gerald Ford|died in his home]] on December 26, 2006. He lived to an older age than any other U.S. president in history, dying at the age of 93.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Ford was born as '''Leslie Lynch King, Jr.''' on July 14, 1913, at [[3202 Woolworth Avenue]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], where his parents lived with his paternal grandparents. His father was [[Leslie Lynch King, Sr.]], a wool trader and son of prominent banker [[Charles Henry King|Charles Henry]] and Martha King. 
His mother was the former [[Dorothy Ayer Gardner Ford|Dorothy Ayer Gardner]]. Dorothy separated from King Sr. just sixteen days after her son's birth. She took her son with her to the [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]], [[Illinois]] home of her sister Tannisse and her husband, Clarence Haskins James. From there she moved to the home of her parents, Levi Addison Gardner and his wife, the former Adele Augusta Ayer, in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]]. Dorothy and Leslie King divorced in December 1913; she gained full custody of their son. Ford's paternal grandfather Charles Henry King paid child support until shortly before his death in 1930.<ref>{{cite book|author=Young, Jeff C.|title=The Fathers of American Presidents|year=1997|isbn=0-7864-0182-6|publisher=McFarland & Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.}}</ref>

Gerald Ford later said his biological father had a history of hitting his mother.<ref name="ford-Nebraska"> {{cite news|title=Nebraska-born Ford Left State as Infant|author=Funk, Josh|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Fox News|date=2006-12-27|url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Dec27/0,4670,FordNebraska,00.html|accessdate=2009-09-02}}</ref> James M. Cannon, a member of the Ford administration, wrote in a Ford biography that the Kings' separation and divorce were sparked when, a few days after Ford's birth, Leslie King threatened Dorothy with a butcher knife and threatened to kill her, Ford, and Ford's nursemaid. Ford later told confidantes that his father had first hit his mother on their honeymoon for smiling at another man.<ref name="pbs-knife"> {{cite web |last=Cannon |first=James |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/character/essays/ford.html |title=Gerald R. Ford |work=Character Above All|publisher=Public Broadcasting System |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref>

After two and a half years with her parents, on February 1, 1916 Dorothy King married [[Gerald Rudolff Ford]], a salesman in a family-owned paint and varnish company. They then called her son ''Gerald Rudolff Ford, Jr''. The future president was never formally [[adoption|adopted]], however, and he did not legally change his name until December 3, 1935; he also used a more conventional spelling of his middle name.<ref name="utexas"> {{cite web |url=http://www.ford.utexas.edu/grf/genealog.asp|title=Gerald R. Ford Genealogical Information |work=Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library & Museum |publisher=University of Texas |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref>  He was raised in [[East Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] with his three half-brothers by his mother's second marriage: Thomas Gardner Ford (1918&ndash;1995), Richard Addison Ford (born 1924), and James Francis Ford (1927&ndash;2001).

Ford also had three half-siblings from his father's second marriage: Marjorie King (1921&ndash;1993), Leslie Henry King (1923&ndash;1976), and Patricia Jane King (born 1925). They never saw each other as children and he did not know them at all. Ford was not aware of his biological father until he was 17, when his parents told him about the circumstances of his birth. That same year his father Leslie King, whom Ford described as a "carefree, well-to-do man," approached Ford while he was waiting tables in a Grand Rapids restaurant. The two "maintained a sporadic contact" until Leslie King, Sr.'s death.<ref name="ford-Nebraska" /><ref>{{cite news |title="A Common Man on an Uncommon Climb"|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 19, 1976|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=2&res=F10F10FF3E5D14768FDDA00994D0405B868BF1D3|page=28|accessdate=2009-04-26}}</ref>

Ford maintained his distance emotionally, saying, "My stepfather was a magnificent person and my mother equally wonderful. So I couldn't have written a better prescription for a superb family upbringing."<ref name="kunhardt"> {{cite book |last=Kunhardt, Jr. |first=Phillip |url=http://www.americanpresident.org/history/geraldford/biography/resources/ArticlesCopy1/KunhardtFordBio.article.shtml |title=Gerald R.

===Scouting and athletics===
Ford was involved in The [[Boy Scouts of America]], and attained that program's highest rank, [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].<ref name="honor">{{cite book |last=Townley |first=Alvin |origdate= [[2006-12-26]] |url=http://us.macmillan.com/legacyofhonor|title=Legacy of Honor: The Values and Influence of America's Eagle Scouts |publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York |pages=12<U+2013>13 and 87|isbn=0-312-36653-1 |accessdate=2006-12-29 |year=2007}}</ref> In subsequent years, Ford received the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] in May 1970 and [[Silver Buffalo Award]] from the Boy Scouts of America. He is the only US president who was an Eagle Scout.<ref name="honor" /> [[Scouting]] was so important to Ford that his family asked that Scouts participate in his funeral. About 400 Eagle Scouts were part of the funeral procession, where they formed an honor guard as the casket went by in front of the museum. <ref>{{cite web |last=Ray |first=Mark |year=2007 |url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0703/a-ford.html |title=Eagle Scout Welcome Gerald Ford Home |work=Scouting Magazine|publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2007-03-05}}</ref>

Ford attended Grand Rapids South High School and was a star athlete and [[captain (sports)|captain]] of his [[American football|football]] team. In 1930, he was selected to the All-City team of the [[Grand Rapids City League]]. He also attracted the attention of college recruiters.<ref name="kunhardt" />

Attending the [[University of Michigan]] as an undergraduate, Ford played [[center (football)|center]] and [[linebacker]] for the school<U+2019>s football team<ref>{{cite news|last=Wertheimer|first=Linda|title=Special Report: Former President Gerald Ford Dies; Sought to Heal Nation Disillusioned by Watergate Scandal|date=December 27, 2006|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4529638|accessdate=2009-04-26}}</ref> and helped the [[Michigan Wolverines football|Wolverines]] to undefeated seasons and [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|national titles]] in 1932 and 1933. The team suffered a steep decline in his 1934 senior year, however, winning only one game. Ford was the team<U+2019>s star nonetheless, and after a game during which Michigan held heavily favored [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]] (the eventual national champion) to a scoreless tie in the first half, assistant coach [[Bennie Oosterbaan]] later said, <U+201C>When I walked into the dressing room at half time, I had tears in my eyes I was so proud of them. Ford and [Cedric] Sweet played their hearts out. They were everywhere on defense.<U+201D> Ford himself later recalled, <U+201C>During 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934. Remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation, take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds.<U+201D> His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player, with one assistant coach noting, <U+201C>They felt Jerry was one guy who would stay and fight in a losing cause.<U+201D><ref name="perry">{{cite book |last=Perry |first=Will |url=http://www.aafla.org/SportsLibrary/FootballStudies/1999/FS0202h.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Wolverines: A Story of Michigan Football|chapter=No Cheers From the Alumni |pages=150<U+2013>152 |publisher=The Strode Publishers |location=Huntsville, Alabama|isbn=0-87397-055-1|accessdate=2006-12-28 |year=1974}}</ref>

During the same season, in a game against the [[University of Chicago]], Ford <U+201C>became the only future U.S. president to tackle a future [[Heisman Trophy]] winner when he brought down running back [[Jay Berwanger]], who would win the first Heisman the following year.<U+201D><ref>{{cite news |title=Ford one of most athletic Presidents |publisher=Associated Press via [[MSNBC]] |date=[[2006-12-27]] |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16367165/ |accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref> In 1934 Gerald Ford was selected for the Eastern Team on the Shriner<U+2019>s East West Crippled Children game at San Francisco (a benefit for crippled children), played on January 1, 1935.

Ford was also an avid [[golf]]er. In 1977, he shot a [[hole in one]] during a Pro-am held in conjunction with the [[Danny Thomas Memphis Classic]] at [[Colonial Country Club (Memphis)|Colonial Country Club]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. He received the 1985 [[Old Tom Morris Award]] from the [[Golf Course Superintendents Association of America]], GCSAA's highest honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gcsaa.org/cm/contentm/modules/display_dynamic.ahtml?params=MSw3ODEs|title=Old Tom Morris Award Recipients|publisher=Golf Course Superintendents Association of America|accessdate=2009-09-02}}</ref>

===Education===
At [[University of Michigan]], Ford became a member of the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity (Omicron chapter) and washed dishes at his fraternity house to earn money for college expenses. Following his graduation in 1935 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[economics]], he turned down contract offers from the [[Detroit Lions]] and [[Green Bay Packers]] of the [[National Football League]] in order to take a coaching position at [[Yale University|Yale]] and apply to its law school. Each team was offering him a contract of $200 a game, but he wanted a legal education.<ref name="proball"> {{cite web |last=Smith|first=Michael David|year=2006 |url=http://nfl.aolsportsblog.com/2006/12/27/lions-packers-had-their-chance-but-gerald-ford-chose-law-and-p/ |title=Lions, Packers Had Their Chance, But Gerald Ford Chose Law and Politics |work=NFL Fanhouse |publisher=AOL Sports Blog |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> Ford continued to contribute to football and boxing, accepting an assistant coaching job for both at Yale in September 1935.<ref name="utexas-grf-timeline"> {{cite web |url=http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/grf/timeline.asp |title=Timeline of President Ford's Life and Career |work=Gerald R.

Ford hoped to attend Yale's law school beginning in 1935 while serving as boxing coach and assistant varsity football coach; and also teaching JV cheerleading, which he was very good at, as he knew how to do several tucks and back handsprings but Yale officials initially denied his admission to the law school, because of his full-time coaching responsibilities. He spent the summer of 1937 as a student at the [[University of Michigan Law School]]<ref name="umlaw">{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.edu/ford/timeline.html |title=The U-M Remembers Gerald R. Ford |publisher=The University of Michigan |accessdate=2007-01-02}}</ref> and was eventually admitted in the spring of 1938 to Yale Law School.<ref name="librarybio"> {{cite web |url=http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/grf/timeline.asp |title=Gerald R.

His introduction to politics came in the summer of 1940 when he worked in [[Wendell Willkie]]'s presidential campaign.
While attending [[Yale Law School]], he joined a group of students led by R. Douglas Stuart, Jr., and signed a petition to enforce the 1939 [[Neutrality Act]]. The petition was circulated nationally and was the inspiration for the [[America First Committee]], a group determined to keep the U.S. out of [[World War II]].<ref name="onlinereader"> {{cite web |last=Doenecke|first=Justus D.|year=1990 |url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0817988416/ |title=In Danger Undaunted: The Anti-Interventionist Movement of 1940<U+2013>1941 As Revealed in the Papers of the America First Committee (Hoover Archival Documentaries) |publisher=Hoover Institution Press |accessdate=2006-12-28}} p. 7</ref>

Ford graduated from law school in 1941, and was admitted to the Michigan [[bar (law)|bar]] shortly there after. In May 1941, he opened a Grand Rapids law practice with a friend, Philip Buchen,<ref name="utexas-grf-timeline" /> who would later serve as Ford's White House counsel. But overseas developments caused a change in plans, and Ford responded to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] by enlisting in the Navy.<ref name="navy"> {{cite news |last=Naughton |first=James M. |coauthors=Adam Clymer |date=2006-12-26 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/27/washington/27webford.html?pagewanted=4 |title=Gerald Ford, 38th President, Dies at 93 years and 165 day |work=[[New York Times]] |publisher=Naval Historical Center |accessdate=2007-10-19}}</ref>

==Naval service in World War II==
[[Image:GeraldFord1945.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The head and shoulders of a man in a World War Two-era uniform of the United States Navy.|Ford in [[United States Navy|Navy]] uniform, 1945]]
Ford received a commission as [[Ensign (rank)#United States|ensign]] in the [[United States Navy Reserve|U.S. Naval Reserve]] on April 13, 1942. On April 20, he reported for active duty to the V-5 instructor school at [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], [[Maryland]]. After one month of training, he went to Navy Preflight School in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[North Carolina]], where he was one of 83 instructors and taught elementary seamanship, ordnance, gunnery, first aid and military drill. In addition, he coached in all nine sports that were offered, but mostly in swimming, boxing and football. During the one year he was at the Preflight School, he was promoted to [[Lieutenant, Junior Grade|Lieutenant Junior Grade]] on June 2, 1942, and to [[Lieutenant]] in March 1943.

Applying for sea duty, Ford was sent in May 1943 to the pre-commissioning detachment for the new aircraft carrier [[USS Monterey (CVL-26)|USS ''Monterey'']], at New York Shipbuilding Corporation, [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], [[New Jersey]]. From the ship's commissioning on June 17, 1943 until the end of December 1944, Ford served as the assistant navigator, Athletic Officer, and antiaircraft battery officer on board the ''Monterey''. While he was on board, the carrier participated in many actions in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific Theater]] with the [[United States Third Fleet|Third]] and [[United States Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleets]] during the fall of 1943 and in 1944. In 1943, the carrier helped secure [[Makin Island]] in the Gilberts, and participated in carrier strikes against [[Kavieng]], New Ireland in 1943. During the spring of 1944, the ''Monterey'' supported landings at [[Kwajalein]] and [[Eniwetok]] and participated in carrier strikes in the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]], [[Caroline Islands|Western Carolines]], and northern [[New Guinea]], as well as in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]].<ref name="hove"> {{cite book |last=Hove |first=Duane |title=American Warriors: Five Presidents in the Pacific Theater of World War II |publisher=Burd Street Press |isbn=1-57249-307-0|accessdate= |year=2003}}</ref> After overhaul, from September to November 1944, aircraft from the ''Monterey'' launched strikes against [[Wake Island]], participated in strikes in the Philippines and [[Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyus]], and supported the landings at [[Leyte Island|Leyte]] and [[Mindoro]].<ref name="hove" />

Although the ship was not damaged by [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces, the ''Monterey'' was one of several ships damaged by the [[typhoon]] that hit [[Admiral]] [[William Halsey, Jr.|William Halsey's]] Third Fleet on [[Typhoon Cobra (1944)|December 18<U+2013>19, 1944]]. The Third Fleet lost three [[destroyer]]s and over 800 men during the typhoon. The ''Monterey'' was damaged by a fire, which was started by several of the ship's aircraft tearing loose from their cables and colliding on the hangar deck. During the storm, Ford narrowly avoided becoming a casualty himself. As he was going to his battle station on the bridge of the ship in the early morning of December 18, the ship rolled twenty-five degrees, which caused Ford to lose his footing and slide toward the edge of the deck. The two-inch steel ridge around the edge of the carrier slowed him enough so he could roll, and he twisted into the catwalk below the deck. As he later stated, "I was lucky; I could have easily gone overboard."

Because of the extent of the fires, Admiral Halsey ordered Captain Ingersoll to abandon ship. Instead Captain Ingersoll ordered Ford to lead a fire brigade below. After five hours he and his team had put out the fire.

On December 24, 1944 at Ulithi, Ford was detached from the ship and sent to the Athletic Department of the Navy Pre-Flight School at [[Saint Mary's College of California]], where he was assigned to the Athletic Department until April 1945. One of his duties was to coach football. From the end of April 1945 to January 1946, he was on the staff of the Naval Reserve Training Command, [[Naval Air Station Glenview|Naval Air Station, Glenview, Illinois]] as the Staff Physical and Military Training Officer. On October 3, 1945 he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander. In January 1946, he was sent to the Separation Center, [[Naval Station Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] to be processed out. He was released from active duty under honorable conditions on February 23, 1946. On June 28, 1946, the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] accepted Ford's resignation from the Naval Reserve.

For his naval service, Gerald Ford earned the [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]] with nine engagement stars for operations in the [[Gilbert Islands]], [[Bismarck Archipelago]], [[Marshall Islands]], Asiatic and Pacific carrier raids, [[Battle of Hollandia|Hollandia]], Marianas, Western Carolines, Western New Guinea, and the Leyte Operation. He also received the [[Philippine Liberation Medal]] with two bronze stars for Leyte and Mindoro, as well as the [[American Campaign Medal|American Campaign]] and [[World War II Victory Medal]]s.<ref name="navy"/>

Ford was a member of several civic organizations, including the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks]], [[American Legion]], [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]], and [[AMVETS]]. Gerald R.

==Marriage and children==
[[Image:Fords wedding 1948.gif|right|thumb|alt=A man in a suit leads a flower-carying woman by the hand, walking out of a chapel.|The Fords on their wedding day, October 15, 1948]]
On October 15, 1948, at Grace [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] in Grand Rapids, Ford married [[Betty Ford|Elizabeth Bloomer Warren]], a department store fashion consultant. Warren had been a [[John Robert Powers]] fashion model and a dancer in the auxiliary troupe of the [[Martha Graham]] Dance Company. She had previously been married to and divorced from William G. Warren.

At the time of his engagement, Ford was campaigning for what would be his first of thirteen terms as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. The wedding was delayed until shortly before the elections because, as [[The New York Times]] reported in a 1974 profile of Betty Ford, "Jerry was running for Congress and wasn't sure how voters might feel about his marrying a divorced ex-dancer."<ref>{{cite news |first=Jane|last=Howard |title=The 38th First Lady: Not a Robot At All |work=The New York Times|date=1974-12-08}}</ref>

The Fords had four children:

*[[John Gardner Ford|John Gardner]], known as Jack, born in 1952

After returning to [[Grand Rapids]], Ford became active in local Republican politics, and supporters urged him to take on [[Bartel J. Jonkman]], the incumbent Republican congressman. Military service had changed his view of the world; "I came back a converted internationalist", Ford wrote, "and of course our congressman at that time was an avowed, dedicated [[United States non-interventionism|isolationist]].

Ford was a member of the House of Representatives for twenty-five years, holding the Grand Rapids [[congressional district]] seat from 1949 to 1973. It was a tenure largely notable for its modesty. As an editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' described him, Ford "saw himself as a negotiator and a reconciler, and the record shows it: he did not write a single piece of major legislation in his entire career."<ref name="nyt-editorial"> {{cite web |year=[[2006-12-28]] |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/character/essays/ford.html |title=Gerald R.

Appointed to the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]] two years after being elected, he was a prominent member of the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense|Defense Appropriations Subcommittee]]. Ford described his philosophy as "a moderate in domestic affairs, an internationalist in foreign affairs, and a [[fiscal conservatism|conservative]] in fiscal policy."

Mahon]], and NASA Administrator [[James E. Webb]] visit the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] for a briefing on the Saturn program, 1964]]
In November 1963, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] appointed Ford to the [[Warren Commission]], a special task force set up to investigate the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]]. Ford was assigned to prepare a biography of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], the accused assassin.<ref>In 1997 the [[Assassination Records Review Board]] (ARRB) released a document that revealed that Ford had altered the first draft of the report to read: "A bullet had entered the base of the back of [Kennedy's] neck slightly to the right of the spine." Some believed that Ford had elevated the location of the wound from its true location in the back to the neck to support the single bullet theory. ({{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAfordG.htm |title=Gerald Ford |publisher=Spartacus Schoolnet |accessdate=2006-12-29}}) The original first draft of the Warren Commission Report stated that a bullet had entered Kennedy's "back at a point slightly above the [[shoulder]] and to the right of the [[vertebral column|spine]]." Ford replied in an introduction to a new edition of the Warren Commission Report in 2004:
<blockquote>I have been accused of changing some wording on the Warren Commission Report to favor the lone-assassin conclusion. That is absurd. Here is what the draft said: "A bullet had entered his back at a point slightly above the shoulder and to the right of the spine.<U+201D> To any reasonable person, <U+201C>above the shoulder and to the right<U+201D> sounds very high and way off the side <U+2014> and that<U+2019>s what it sounded like to me. That would have given the totally wrong impression. Technically, from a medical perspective, the bullet entered just to the right at the base of the neck, so my recommendation to the other members was to change it to say, <U+201C>A bullet had entered the back of his neck, slightly to the right of the spine.<U+201D> After further investigation, we then unanimously agreed that it should read, <U+201C>A bullet had entered the base of his neck slightly to the right of the spine.<U+201D> As with any report, there were many clarifications and language changes suggested by several of us.</blockquote>
Ford's description matched a [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh16/html/WH_Vol16_0501a.htm drawing] prepared for the Commission under the direction of Dr. James J.

Kennedy.
He said the commission's probe put "certain classified and potentially damaging operations in danger of being exposed." The CIA's reaction, he added, "was to hide or destroy some information, which can easily be misinterpreted as collusion in JFK's assassination."

According to a 1963 [[FBI]] memo released in 2008, Ford secretly provided the FBI with information regarding two of his fellow commission members, both of whom were dubious about the FBI's conclusions regarding the assassination. The FBI position was that President Kennedy was shot by a single gunman firing from the Texas Book Depository. Another 1963 memo released in 1978 stated that Representative Ford volunteered to advise the FBI regarding the content of the commission's deliberations, provided that his involvement with the bureau was kept confidential, a condition which the bureau approved.<ref name="WPostFBI">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/07/AR2008080702757.html|title=Ford Told FBI of Skeptics on Warren Commission|last=Stephens|first=Joe|date=August 8, 2008|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref> Ford generally believed in the single assassin theory.<ref name="FBI File">{{cite news|title=Ford told FBI about panel's doubts on JFK murder|publisher=USA Today|date=2008-08-09|accessdate=2009-09-02}} </ref> According to the same reports, Ford generally had strong ties to the FBI and [[J.

===House Minority Leader===

A sixth man is visible from behind, facing the speaker.| Ford meets with President Richard Nixon as [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]]]]
In 1964, Democratic President [[Lyndon Johnson]] led a landslide victory for his party, securing another term as president and taking 36 seats from Republicans in the House of Representatives. Following the election, members of the Republican delegation looked to select a new [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Leader]]. Three members approached Ford to see if he would be willing to serve; after consulting with his family, he agreed. After a closely contested election, Ford was chosed to replace [[Charles Halleck]] of [[Indiana]] as Minority Leader.<ref name="mastersDavidson">{{cite book|title=Masters of the House: Congressional leadership over two centuries|authors=Roger H. Davidson, Susan Webb Hammond, Raymond Smock|publisher=Westview Press|date=1988|pages=267-275}}</ref>

Ford had 140 votes compared to the 295 seats held by the Democrats. As a result, the Johnson Administration was able to propose and pass a series of programs termed by President Johnson as the "[[Great Society]]". During the first session of the of the [[89th United States Congress|Eighty-ninth Congress]] alone, the Johnson Administration submitted eighty-seven bills to Congress, and Johnson signed eighty-four, or 96%, arguably the most successful legislative agenda in U.S. Congressional history.<ref name="unger104">Unger, Irwin, 1996: 'The Best of Intentions: the triumphs and failures of the Great Society under Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon': Doubleday, p. 104.</ref> 

Criticism over the Johnson Administration's handling of the [[Vietnam War]] began to grow in 1966, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1966|1966 midterm elections]] saw a 47-seat swing in favor of the Republicans. This was not sufficent to give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory did give Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.<ref name="mastersDavidson" />

Ford's private criticism of the Vietnam war became public following a speech from the floor of the House, in which he questioned whether the White House had a clear plan to bring the conflict to a successful conclusion.<ref name="mastersDavidson" /> The speech angered President Johnson, who accused Ford of playing "too much football without a helmet."<ref name="mastersDavidson" /><ref name="Timesteady">{{cite news|title=Gerald Ford: Steady Hand for a Nation in Crisis|publisher=Time Magazine|author=Gray, Paul|date=2006-12-27|accessdate=2009-09-16|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1572927,00.html}}</ref> 

As Minority Leader in the House, Ford appeared in a popular series of televised [[press conference]]s with famed [[Illinois]] Senator [[Everett Dirksen]], in which they proposed Republican alternatives to Johnson's policies. Many in the press jokingly called this "The Ev and Jerry Show".<ref name="ussenate"> {{cite web |last=Ford |first=Gerald |year=[[2001-05-23]] |url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Leaders_Lecture_Series_Ford.htm |title=Address by President Gerald R.

Ford's role shifted under [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]] to being an advocate for the White House agenda. Congress passed several of Nixon's proposals, including the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] and the [[Tax Reform Act of 1969]]. Another high-profile victory for the Republican minority was the State and Local Fiscal Assistance act. Passed in 1972, the act established a [[Revenue Sharing]] program for state and local governments.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Handbook of Social Policy|authors=James Midgley, Michelle Livermore|publisher=SAGE|year=2008|isbn=1412950767|page=162}}</ref> Ford's leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through congress, and culminated in a bipartisan coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor (compared to 185 against).<ref name="mastersDavidson" /><ref>{{cite book|title=Nixon Reconsidered|author=Hoff, Joan|publisher=Basic Books|year=1995|page=69|isbn=0465051057}}</ref>
 
During the eight years (1965&ndash;1973) he served as Minority Leader, Ford won many friends in the House because of his fair leadership and inoffensive personality.<ref name="nlhistory"/> An office building in the U.S. Capitol Complex, House Annex 2, was renamed for Gerald Ford as the [[Ford House Office Building]].

==Vice Presidency, 1973&ndash;74==
On October 10, 1973, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Spiro Agnew]] resigned and then pleaded [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] to criminal charges of tax evasion and money laundering, part of a negotiated resolution to a scheme wherein he accepted $29,500 in bribes while governor of Maryland. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "Nixon sought advice from senior Congressional leaders about a replacement. The advice was unanimous. 'We gave Nixon no choice but Ford,' [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Carl Albert]] recalled later".<ref name="nyt-editorial" />

Ford was nominated to take Agnew's position on October 12, the first time the vice-presidential vacancy provision of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]] had been implemented. The [[United States Senate]] voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford on November 27. Only three Senators, all Democrats, had voted against Ford's confirmation: [[Gaylord Nelson]] of [[Wisconsin]], [[Thomas Eagleton]] of [[Missouri]] and [[William Hathaway]] of [[Maine]]. On December 6, the House confirmed Ford by a vote of 387 to 35. One hour after the confirmation vote in the House, Ford took the oath of office as Vice President of the United States.

Ford's brief tenure as Vice-President was little noted by the media. Instead, reporters were preoccupied by the continuing revelations about criminal acts during the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential election]] and allegations of cover-ups within the [[White House]].

Following Ford's appointment, the Watergate investigation continued until [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] [[Alexander Haig]] contacted Ford on August 1, 1974, and told him that "[[smoking gun]]" evidence had been found. The evidence left little doubt that President Nixon had been a part of the Watergate cover-up. At the time, Ford and his wife, Betty, were living in suburban Virginia, waiting for their expected move into the newly designated [[Number One Observatory Circle|vice president's residence]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] However, "Al Haig [asked] to come over and see me," Ford later related, "to tell me that there would be a new [[Watergate tapes|tape]] released on a Monday, and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation. And he said, 'I'm just warning you that you've got to be prepared, that things might change dramatically and you could become President.' And I said, 'Betty, I don't think we're ever going to live in the vice president's house.'"<ref name="kunhardt" />

When Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal on August 9, 1974, Ford assumed the presidency, making him the only person to assume the vice-presidency and the presidency without having been voted into either office. Immediately after taking the oath of office in the [[East Room (White House)|East Room]] of the [[White House]], he spoke to the assembled audience in a speech broadcast live to the nation. Ford noted the peculiarity of his position: "I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your president by your ballots, and so I ask you to confirm me as your president with your prayers."<ref name="ISP">{{cite web |year=1974 |url=http://watergate.info/ford/ford-swearing-in.shtml|title=Remarks By President Gerald Ford On Taking the Oath Of Office As President |publisher=Watergate.info |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> He went on to state:

<blockquote>
I have not sought this enormous responsibility, but I will not shirk it. Those who nominated and confirmed me as Vice President were my friends and are my friends. They were of both parties, elected by all the people and acting under the Constitution in their name.

On August 20, Ford nominated former [[New York]] Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] to fill the vice presidency he had vacated. Rockefeller's top competitor had been [[George H. W. Bush]]. Rockefeller underwent extended hearings before Congress, which caused embarrassment when it was revealed he made massive gifts to senior aides, such as [[Henry Kissinger]]. Although conservative Republicans were not pleased that Rockefeller was picked, most of them did vote for his confirmation, and his nomination passed both the House and Senate. However, some, including [[Barry Goldwater]], voted against him.<ref>{{cite web|author=Monday, May. 12, 1975 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917422,00.html |title=THE VICE PRESIDENCY: Rocky's Turn to the Right |publisher=TIME |date=1975-05-12 |accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref>

===Pardon of Nixon===
On September 8, 1974, Ford issued [[:wikisource:Proclamation 4311|Proclamation 4311]], which gave Nixon a full and unconditional [[pardon]] for any crimes he may have committed against the United States while President.<ref name="pardonspeech">{{cite web |last=Ford |first=Gerald |year=[[1974-09-08]] |url=http://www.ford.utexas.edu/library/speeches/740061.htm|title=President Gerald R.

The Nixon pardon was highly controversial. Critics derided the move and claimed, a "[[corrupt bargain]]" had been struck between the men.<ref name="kunhardt" /> They claimed Ford's pardon was ''[[quid pro quo]]'', in exchange for Nixon's resignation that elevated Ford to the Presidency. According to [[Bob Woodward]], Nixon Chief of Staff [[Alexander Haig]] proposed a pardon deal to Ford. In his book ''Shadow'', Woodward states that Haig entered Ford's office on August 1, 1974 while Ford was still Vice President and Nixon had yet to resign. Haig told Ford that there were three pardon options: (1) Nixon could pardon himself and resign; (2) Nixon could pardon his aides involved in Watergate and then resign; or (3) Nixon could agree to leave in return for an agreement that the new president would pardon him. After listing these options, Haig handed Ford various papers; one of these papers included a discussion of the president's legal authority to pardon, and another sheet was a draft pardon form that only needed Ford's signature and Nixon's name to make it legal. Woodward summarizes the setting between Haig and Ford as follows: "Even if Haig offered no direct words on his views, the message was almost certainly sent. An emotional man, Haig was incapable of concealing his feelings; those who worked closely with him rarely found him ambiguous."

{{wikisource|Proclamation 4311|The Nixon Pardon}}
Despite the situation, Ford never accepted any offer from Haig. He later decided to pardon Nixon for other reasons, primarily the friendship he and Nixon shared.<ref name="shanescott">{{cite news|first=Scott |last=Shane |title=For Ford, Pardon Decision Was Always Clear-Cut|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/29/washington/29pardon.html|publisher=The New York Times|page=A1 |accessdate=2006-12-29 |accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref> Regardless, historians believe the controversy was one of the major reasons Ford lost the [[United States presidential election, 1976|election in 1976]], an observation with which Ford concurred.<ref name="shanescott" /> In an editorial at the time, ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that the Nixon pardon was "a profoundly unwise, divisive and unjust act" that in a stroke had destroyed the new president's "credibility as a man of judgment, candor and competence."<ref name="nyt-editorial" />

After Ford left the White House in 1977, intimates said that the former President privately justified his pardon of Nixon by carrying in his wallet a portion of the text of ''[[Burdick v. United States]]'', a 1915 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt.<ref name="shanescott"/> In 2001, the [[John F.

Kennedy]] [[Profile in Courage Award]] to Ford for his pardon of Nixon.<ref name="anoun"> {{cite web |year=[[2001-05-01]]|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Education+and+Public+Programs/Profile+in+Courage+Award/Award+Recipients/Gerald+Ford/Award+Announcement.htm|title=Award Announcement |publisher=JFK Library Foundation |accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref>  In presenting the award to Ford, Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon of Nixon, but admitted that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision.{{CN|date=September 2009|I don't see that.

===Administration and cabinet===
Upon assuming office, Ford inherited Nixon's [[United States Cabinet|cabinet]]. Over the course of Ford's relatively brief administration, only [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[William E. Simon]] remained. Ford appointed [[William T.

===Midterm elections===
{{Main|United States House elections, 1974|United States Senate elections, 1974}}
The 1974 Congressional midterm elections took place less than three months after Ford assumed office and in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The Democratic Party was able to turn voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the [[United States House elections, 1974|House elections]], taking 49 seats from the Republican Party, and increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats. This was one more than the number needed (290) for a 2/3rds majority, necessary in order to over-ride a Presidential [[veto]] (or to submit a Constitutional Amendment). Perhaps due in part to this fact, the [[94th United States Congress|94th Congress]] overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since [[Andrew Johnson]] was President of the United States (1865<U+2013>1869).<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/POLITICS/blogs/politicalticker/2007/05/bush-vetoes-less-than-most-presidents.html Bush vetoes less than most presidents], CNN, May 1, 2007.

The [[Economy of the United States|economy]] was a great concern during the Ford administration. In response to rising [[inflation]], Ford went before the American public in October 1974 and asked them to "'''W'''hip '''I'''nflation '''N'''ow."

Ford was confronted with a potential [[swine flu]] [[pandemic]]. Sometime in the early 1970s, an [[influenza]] strain [[H1N1]] shifted from a form of flu that affected primarily pigs and crossed over to humans. On February 5, 1976, an [[United States Army|Army]] recruit at [[Fort Dix, New Jersey|Fort Dix]] mysteriously died and four fellow soldiers were hospitalized; [[Centers for Disease Control|health officials]] announced that "swine flu" was the cause. Soon after, public health officials in the Ford administration urged that every person in the United States be [[vaccination|vaccinated]].<ref>[http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.htm?programID=06-P13-00009&segmentID=1 Pandemic Pointers.] [[Living on Earth]], March 3, 2006.

Ford was an outspoken supporter of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], issuing Presidential Proclamation 4383.
<blockquote>
In this Land of the Free, it is right, and by nature it ought to be, that all men and all women are equal before the law.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Now, THEREFORE, I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, to remind all Americans that it is fitting and just to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment adopted by the Congress of the United States of America, in order to secure legal equality for all women and men, do hereby designate and proclaim August 26, 1975, as Women's Equality Day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=23839 |title=Proclamation 4383 - Women's Equality Day, 1975 |accessdate=2008-04-08 |work=Larry King Live Weekend |publisher=The American Presidency Project}}</ref>

====Budget====
Ford ran a budget [[deficit]] (which he had inherited from his predecessors) every year he was President.<ref name="crs">[http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL33305_20060309.pdf CRS Report RL33305, The Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax of the 1980s: Implications for Current Energy Policy], by Salvatore Lazzari, p. 5.</ref> Despite his reservations about how this program ultimately would be funded in an era of tight public budgeting, Ford still signed the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] of 1975, which established [[special education]] throughout the United States.

The economic focus began to change as the country sank into a mild [[recession]], and in March 1975, Congress passed and Ford signed into law [[income tax]] rebates as part of the [[Tax Reduction Act of 1975]] to boost the economy. When [[New York City]] faced [[bankruptcy]] in 1975, [[List of mayors of New York City|Mayor]] [[Abraham Beame]] was unsuccessful in obtaining Ford's support for a federal bailout.

Ford attended the inaugural meeting of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized nations (initially the G5) in 1975 and secured membership for Canada. Ford supported international solutions to issues. "We live in an interdependent world and, therefore, must work together to resolve common economic problems," he said in a 1974 speech.<ref name="canadaG7"> {{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/12/27/ford-canada.html |title=President Ford got Canada into G7 |date=December 27, 2006 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Company|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref>

In his Presidential memoir, Ford writes, <U+201C>No foreign-policy challenges occupied more of my time in the early months of 1975 than the deteriorating situations in both the [[Middle East]] and [[Indochina]].<U+201D><ref>Gerald Ford, A Time to Heal, 1979, p.238</ref> In Indochina, Ford faced a foreign policy crisis with the [[Mayaguez Incident]]. In May 1975, shortly after the [[Khmer Rouge]] took power in [[Cambodia]], Cambodians seized the American merchant ship ''Mayaguez'' in international waters. Ford dispatched [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] to rescue the crew, but the Marines landed on the wrong island and met unexpectedly stiff resistance just as, unknown to the U.S., the ''Mayaguez'' sailors were being released. In the operation,Two Military transport helocopters carrying the Marines for the Assault operation were shotdown, 41 U.S. servicemen were killed and 50 wounded while approximately 60 Khmer Rouge soldiers were killed.<ref name="marinemerchants"> {{cite web |year=2000 |url=http://www.usmm.org/mayaguez.html |title=Capture and Release of SS Mayaguez by Khmer Rouge forces in May 1975 |publisher=United States Merchant Marine |accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref>

In the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean, two on-going international disputes developed into crises.  The ongoing [[Cyprus dispute#Peacemaking efforts, 1964-1974|Cyprus dispute]] turned into a crisis with the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], causing extreme strain within the [[NATO]] alliance.  In mid-August, the [[Greek military junta of 1967<U+2013>1974|government]] withdrew Greece from the NATO military structure; in mid-September 1974 the Senate and House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to Turkey. Ford, concerned with both the effect of this on Turkish-American relations and the deterioration of security on NATO<U+2019>s eastern front, vetoed the bill. A second bill was passed by the house, and also vetoed, although a compromise was accepted to continue aid until the end of the year.<ref name="Lenczowski" />  As Ford expected, Turkish relations were [[United States-Turkey relations#Invasion of Cyprus|considerably disrupted until 1978]].

In the continuing [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], although the initial [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338|cease fire]] had been implemented to end active conflict in the [[Yom Kippur War]], Kissinger<U+2019>s continuing [[shuttle diplomacy]] was showing little progress.  Ford considered it <U+201C>stalling<U+201D> and wrote, <U+201C>Their [Israeli] tactics frustrated the Egyptians and made me mad as hell.<U+2019><ref>Gerald Ford, A Time to Heal, 1979, p.240</ref>  During Kissinger<U+2019>s shuttle to Israel in early March 1975, a last minute reversal to consider further withdrawal, prompted a cable from Ford to Prime Minister [[Yitzak Rabin]], which included;<blockquote>I wish to express my profound disappointment over Israel<U+2019>s attitude in the course of the negotiations<U+2026> Failure of the negotiation will have a far reaching impact on the region and on our relations.  I have given instructions for a reassessment of United States policy in the region, including our relations with Israel, with the aim of ensuring that overall American interests<U+2026> are protected.  You will be notified of our decision<ref>Yitzak Rabin, The Rabin Memoirs, ISBN 0-520-20766-1 , p256</ref></blockquote>
On March 24, Ford received congressional leaders of both parties and informed them of the reassessment of the administration policies in the Middle East.  There was only one way a <U+201C>reassessment<U+201D> could have a practical meaning: to cancel or suspend further aid to Israel.  And this indeed was what happened.  For six months between March and September 1975 the United States refused to conclude any new arms agreements with Israel.  Rabin notes it was <U+201D>an innocent-sounding term that heralded one of the worst periods in American-Israeli relations.<U+201D><ref>Yitzak Rabin, The Rabin Memoirs, ISBN 0-520-20766-1 , p261</ref>  As could be expected, the announced reassessments upset the American Jewish community and Israel<U+2019>s well-wishers in Congress.  On May 21, Ford <U+201C>experienced a real shock,<U+201D> seventy six senators wrote him a letter urging him to be <U+201C>responsive<U+201D> to Israel<U+2019>s request for $2.59 billion in military and economic aid.  Ford felt truly annoyed and thought the chance for peace was jeopardized.  It was, since the September 1974 ban on arms to Turkey, the second major congressional intrusion upon the President<U+2019>s [foreign policy] prerogatives.<ref>[[George Lenczowsk]], American Presidents, and the Middle East, 1990, p.150</ref>  The following summer months were described by Ford as an American-Israeli <U+201C>war of nerves<U+201D> or <U+201D>test of wills,<U+201D><ref>Gerald Ford, A Time to Heal, 1979, p.298</ref> and after much bargaining, the [[Sinai Interim Agreement]] (Sinai II), was formally signed on September 1 and aid resumed.

====Vietnam====
One of Ford's greatest challenges was dealing with the continued Conflict in Vietnam. American offensive operations against North Vietnam had ended with the [[Paris Peace Accords]], signed on 27 January 1973. The accords declared a cease fire across both North and South Vietnam, and required the release of American prisoners of war. A cease-fire was declared across North and South Vietnam. U.S. [[POW]]s were released. The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of [[Vietnam]] and, like the [[Geneva Conference]] of 1954, called for national elections in the North and South. The Paris Peace Accords stipulated a sixty-day period for the total withdrawal of U.S. forces.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Peter Church|title=A Short History of South-East Asia.|country=Singapore|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2006|pages=193<U+2013>194}} </ref>

The accords had been negotiated by [[United States National Security Advisor]] Dr. [[Henry Kissinger]] and North Vietnamese [[politburo]] member [[Le Duc Tho]]. South Vietnamese President [[Nguyen Van Thieu]] was not involved in the final negotiations, and publicly criticized the proposed agreement. However, anti-war pressures within the United States forced Nixon and Kissinger to pressure Thieu to sign the agreement and enable the withdrawal of American forces. In multiple letters to the South Vietnamese president, Nixon had promised that the United States would defend his government, should the North Vietnamese violate the accords.<ref name="Brinkley1">{{cite book |author=Brinkley, Douglas |year=2007 |title=Gerald R. Ford|isbn=0-805-06909-7 |publisher=Times Books |location=New York, NY|pages=89-98}}</ref>

In December 1974, just months after Ford took office, North Vietnamese forces invaded the province of [[Phuoc Long]].

===Assassination attempts===
Ford faced two [[assassination]] attempts during his presidency, occurring within three weeks of each other: while in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[California]] on September 5, 1975, [[Lynette Fromme|Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme]], a follower of [[Charles Manson]], pointed a [[M1911 Colt pistol|Colt 45]]-caliber [[handgun]] at Ford. As Fromme pulled the trigger, [[Larry Buendorf]],<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1026_041026_tv_secret_service2_2.html Election Is Crunch Time for U.S. Secret Service.] National Geographic News. Retrieved on [[2008-03-02]]. </ref> a Secret Service agent, grabbed the gun and managed to insert the webbing of his thumb under the hammer, preventing the gun from firing. It was later found that, although the gun was loaded with four cartridges, it was a [[semi-automatic pistol]] and the slide had not been pulled to place a round in the firing chamber, making it impossible for the gun to fire. Fromme was taken into custody; she was later convicted of attempted assassination of the President and was sentenced to life in prison.<ref name="squeakeyparole"> {{cite news |last=McLaren |first=Janet|date=2005-06-26 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/322697p-275745c.html |title='Squeaky' up for parole |work=New York Daily News |accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref>

[[Image:AV89-26-14 600d.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A chaotic scene of motorcade vehicles surrounded by crowd of people including police and press|Reaction immediately after the second assassination attempt.]]
In reaction to this attempt, the Secret Service started to keep Ford at a more secure distance from anonymous crowds, a strategy that may have saved his life seventeen days later: as he left a hotel in downtown [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[Sara Jane Moore]], standing in a crowd of onlookers across the street, pointed her pistol at him.<ref name="Secret Service">{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/ustreas/usss/t1pubrpt.html |title=Public Report of the White House Security Review |author=United States Secret Service |accessdate=2007-01-03|publisher=United States Department of the Treasury}}</ref>  Just before she fired, former Marine [[Oliver Sipple]] grabbed at the gun and deflected her shot; one person was injured.

===Supreme Court appointment===
In 1975, Ford appointed [[John Paul Stevens]] as [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]] to replace retiring Justice [[William O. Douglas]]. Stevens had been a judge of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]], appointed by President Nixon.<ref name="stephensJP"> {{cite web |url=http://www.oyez.org/oyez/resource/legal_entity/101/biography |title=John Paul Stevens |publisher=OYEZ|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref> During his tenure as House Republican leader, Ford had led efforts to have Douglas impeached.

==Post-presidential years, 1977<U+2013>2006==
===Activity===
The Nixon pardon controversy eventually subsided. Ford's successor, Jimmy Carter, opened his 1977 [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugural address]] by praising the outgoing President, saying, "For myself and for our Nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land."<ref name="JC">{{cite web |date=1977-01-20 |url=http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres60.html |title=Jimmy Carter |work=U.S. Inaugural Addresses |publisher=Bartleby.com |accessdate=2009-08-14}}</ref>

Ford remained relatively active in the years after his presidency and continued to make appearances at events of historical and ceremonial significance to the nation, such as presidential inaugurals and memorial services. In 1977, he reluctantly agreed to be interviewed by James M. Naughton, a ''New York Times'' journalist who was given the assignment to write the former President's advance obituary, an article that would be updated prior to its eventual publication.<ref name="poynterX">{{cite web |last=Naughton |first=James M |date=2006-12-27 |url=http://www.poynter.org/content/content_view.asp?id=115796|title=The Real Jerry Ford |publisher=PoynterOnline |accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref>  In 1979, Ford published his autobiography, ''A Time to Heal'' (Harper/Reader's Digest, 454 pages). A review in ''Foreign Affairs'' described it as, "Serene, unruffled, unpretentious, like the author. This is the shortest and most honest of recent presidential memoirs, but there are no surprises, no deep probings of motives or events. No more here than meets the eye."<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Gaddis|title=A Time to Heal|work=[[Foreign Affairs]]|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|year=1979|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19790901fabook14015/gerald-r-ford/a-time-to-heal.html|accessdate=2009-04-26}}</ref>

During the term of office of his successor, Jimmy Carter, Ford received monthly briefs by President Carter<U+2019>s senior staff on international and domestic issues, and was always invited to lunch at the White House whenever he was in Washington, D.C. Their close friendship developed after Carter had left office, with the catalyst being their trip together to the funeral of [[Anwar el-Sadat]] in 1981.<ref name="NYTobit">{{cite news |last=Kornblut |first=Anne |date=2006-12-29 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/29/washington/29funeral.html?ex=1325048400&en=44d6cd10bbdba342&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss |title=Ford Arranged His Funeral to Reflect Himself and Drew in a Former Adversary |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref> Until Ford's death, Carter and his wife, [[Rosalynn Carter|Rosalynn]], visited the Fords' home frequently.<ref>Updegrove, Mark K.

"Certainly few observers in January 1977 would have predicted that Jimmy and I would become the closest of friends," Ford said in 2000.</ref> In 2001, Ford and Carter served as honorary co-chairs of the [[National Commission on Federal Election Reform]].

Like Presidents Carter, H. W. Bush and [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], Ford was an honorary co-chair of the [[Council for Excellence in Government]], a group dedicated to excellence in government performance and which provides leadership training to top federal employees.

After securing the Republican nomination in 1980, Ronald Reagan gave serious consideration to his former rival Ford as a potential vice-presidential running mate, but negotiations between the Reagan and Ford camps at the [[1980 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] were unsuccessful. Ford conditioned his acceptance on Reagan's agreement to an unprecedented "co-presidency",<ref name="meeteye">{{cite web |last=Thomas|first=Evan |year=2007 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/56688 |title=The 38th President: More Than Met the Eye|publisher=Newsweek National News |accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref> giving Ford the power to control key executive branch appointments (such as [[Henry Kissinger]] as Secretary of State and [[Alan Greenspan]] as Treasury Secretary).

After his presidency, Ford joined the [[American Enterprise Institute]] as a distinguished fellow. He founded the annual [[AEI World Forum]] in 1982. Ford was awarded an [[Commencement at CCSU | honorary doctorate at Central Connecticut State University]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=15404901&BRD=1641&PAG=461&dept_id=17739&rfi=6|title=A $3m gift |last=WHIPPLE|first=SCOTT|date=10/18/2005|publisher=The New Britain Herald|accessdate=2009-09-09}}</ref> on March 23, 1988.

In 1977, he established the [[Gerald R. Ford Institute of Public Policy]] at [[Albion College]] in [[Albion, Michigan|Albion]], [[Michigan]], to give undergraduates training in public policy. In April 1981, he opened the [[Gerald R.

In October 2001, Ford broke with conservative members of the Republican party by stating that gay and lesbian couples "ought to be treated equally. Period." He became the highest ranking Republican to embrace full equality for gays and lesbians, stating his belief that there should be a federal amendment outlawing anti-gay job discrimination and expressing his hope that the Republican Party would reach out to gay and lesbian voters.<ref> Price, Deb.

On November 22, 2004, New York Republican Governor [[George Pataki]] named Ford and the other living former Presidents (Carter, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton) as honorary members of the board rebuilding the [[World Trade Center]].

In a pre-recorded [[news embargo|embargoed interview]] with [[Bob Woodward]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in July 2004, Ford stated that he disagreed "very strongly" with the Bush administration's choice of Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction as justification for its decision to [[Iraq War|invade Iraq]], calling it a "big mistake" unrelated to the national security of the United States and indicating that he would not have gone to war had he been President.

Ford was the [[List of United States Presidents by age|longest-lived U.S. President]], his lifespan being 45 days longer than [[Ronald Reagan]]'s. He was the [[List of United States Vice Presidents by longevity|third-longest-lived Vice President]], falling short only of [[John Nance Garner]], 98, and [[Levi P. Morton]], 96. Ford had the second-longest post-presidency (29 years and 11 months) after [[Herbert Hoover]] (31 years and 7 months).

On November 12, 2006 upon surpassing Ronald Reagan's lifespan, Ford released his last public statement:
<blockquote>The length of one<U+2019>s days matters less than the love of one<U+2019>s family and friends. I thank God for the gift of every sunrise and, even more, for all the years He has blessed me with Betty and the children; with our extended family and the friends of a lifetime. That includes countless Americans who, in recent months, have remembered me in their prayers. Your kindness touches me deeply.
