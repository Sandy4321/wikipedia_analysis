The '''Army of the [[Alps]]''' (''Arm<U+00E9>e des Alpes'') was one of the [[French Revolutionary armies]].  It existed from 1792-97 and from July to August 1799, and the name was also used on and off right up until 1939 for France's army on its border with Italy.

==1792-7==
The Arm<U+00E9>e des Alpes was created by a decree of the [[French Convention]] on 1 October 1792 which divided the [[arm<U+00E9>e du Midi]] into the arm<U+00E9>e des Alpes and [[arm<U+00E9>e des Pyr<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>es]], and on 1 November the following year it was itself divided into the [[arm<U+00E9>e de Savoie]] and [[arm<U+00E9>e d'Italie]] by a conseil ex<U+00E9>cutif decree.  

Following the decrees of 27-29 November 1793 which brought [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]] back into the [[First French Republic|France]] under the name of "the d<U+00E9>partement of Le Mont-Blanc", the arm<U+00E9>e de Savoie was renamed the arm<U+00E9>e des Alpes, before having a ''camp before Lyon'' split off from it between 8 August and 29 October 1793.  The 1793 Arm<U+00E9>e des Alpes was finally suppressed by a decree of 21 August 1797 (21 fructidor year V), put into effect on 13 September, with its men and theatre transferred to the [[arm<U+00E9>e d'Italie]]

==1799==
Created on 27 July 1799, this incarnation of the Arm<U+00E9>e des Alpes only lasted until 29 August 1799, when it was merged into the arm<U+00E9>e d'Italie.
