'''''Stygimoloch''''' (meaning "horned devil from the Styx (river of death)") is a putative [[genus]] of [[Pachycephalosauria|pachycephalosaurid]] [[dinosaur]] from the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period, roughly 65&nbsp;million years ago. It is currently known from the [[Hell Creek Formation]], [[Ferris Formation]],  and [[Lance Formation]] of the Western Interior ([[United States]]), where it lived alongside ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' and ''[[Triceratops]]''. It may represent a sub-adult form of ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]''. 

The [[type species]], ''S. spinifer'', was described by British [[vertebrate paleontology|vertebrate paleontologist]] [[Peter Galton]] and German paleontologist [[Hans-Dieter Sues]] of the [[National Museum of Natural History]] in 1983. 
==Description==
It is a relatively large pachycephalosaur, with the skull being about 46&nbsp;[[centimetre|centimeters]] long (18&nbsp;[[inch|in]]). Among North American pachycephalosaurs, only ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'' is larger. Unlike other pachycephalosaurs, the domed skull is relatively small, slightly flattened from side to side, and pear-shaped; even when isolated this unusual dome can easily be distinguished from the broader, larger domes of ''Pachycephalosaurus''.
While the dome is reduced in size, the ornamentation over the skull is more elaborate than in any other pachycephalosaur. Short, conical hornlets covered the nose, and the back corners of the skull bore an enormous pair of massive, backward-pointing spikes, up to 5&nbsp;centimeters in diameter (2&nbsp;in) and 15&nbsp;centimeters long (6&nbsp;in); these are surrounded by two or three smaller spikes. The function of this unusual ornamentation is unknown. Even if other pachycephalosaurs did butt heads (which is a subject of continuing debate), the small dome of ''Stygimoloch'' suggests that this behavior was not as important. Instead, the skull ornament might have functioned for display, may have been used for self-defense, or perhaps were locked together and used in shoving matches, like the horns of deer. More likely, however, is that the squamosal horns were used to inflict pain during flank-butting.<ref name=KC97>{{cite journal |last=Carpenter |first=Kenneth  |authorlink=Kenneth Carpenter |year=1997 |title=Agonistic behavior in pachycephalosaurs (Ornithischia:Dinosauria): a new look at head-butting behavior |journal=Contributions to Geology |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages= 19<U+2013>25 |url=https://scientists.dmns.org/sites/kencarpenter/PDFs%20of%20publications/pachy%20head%20butting.pdf |format=pdf}}</ref>

==Classification==
The pachycephalosaur ''[[Dracorex]]'' may actually be an individual of ''Stygimoloch'' or ''Pachycephalosaurus'' in which the dome and horns are not well-developed, either because the animal was a juvenile or a female. This consideration was supported at the 2007 annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.<ref>Erik Stokstad,"SOCIETY OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY MEETING: Did Horny Young Dinosaurs Cause Illusion of Separate Species?", ''Science'' Vol. 18, 23 Nov. 2007, p. 1236; http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5854/1236</ref> Jack Horner of [[Montana State University - Bozeman|Montana State University]] presented evidence, from analysis of the skull of the single existing ''Dracorex'' specimen, that this dinosaur may well be a juvenile form of ''Stygimoloch''. In addition, he presented data that indicates that both ''Stygimoloch'' and ''Dracorex'' may be juvenile forms of ''Pachycephalosaurus''. Horner and M.B. Goodwin published their findings in 2009, showing that the spike/node and skull dome bones of all three 'species' exhibit extreme plasticity, and that both ''Dracorex'' and ''Stygimoloch'' are known only from juvenile specimens while ''Pachycephalosaurus'' is known only from adult specimens. These observations, in addition to the fact that all three forms lived in the same time and place, lead them to conclude that ''Dracorex'' and ''Stygimoloch'' were simply juvenile ''Pachycephalosaurus'', which lost spikes and grew domes as they aged.<ref name=horneretal2009>Horner J.R. and Goodwin, M.B.

[http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0007626 Online full text]</ref> A 2010 study bu Nick Longrich and colleagues also supported the hypothesis that all flat-skulled pachycephalosaurs were juveniles, suggesting that flat-skulled forms like ''Goyocephale'' and ''Homalocephale'' represent juveniles of dome-skulled adults.<ref name=longrichetal2010>Longrich, N.R., Sankey, J. and Tanke, D.
