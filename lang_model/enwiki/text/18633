'''Mary Main''' is a researcher at [[University of California, Berkeley]] who with colleagues identified and empiricized a fourth [[attachment in children|attachment style in children]], namely an insecure [[Attachment_in_children#Disorganized_attachment|disorganized]] attachment style. It can be characterized by a lack of a coherent 'organized' behavioral strategy for dealing with the stresses during the [[Attachment_in_children#Attachment_classification_in_children:_The_Strange_Situation_Protocol|Strange Situation Protocol]]. <ref name="Main & Solomon 1986"/><ref name="Main, M & Solomon, J., 1990"/>

There is a growing body of research on the links between abnormal parenting, disorganized attachment and risks for later psychopathologies.<ref name="Zeanah et al. (2003)"/> Abuse is associated with disorganized attachment.<ref name="Van Ijzendoorn M. H., Schuengel C., Bakermans Kranenburg M. J."/><ref name="Carlson, V., Cicchetti, D., Barnett, D., & Braunwald, K."/> The disorganized style is a risk factor for a range of psychological disorders although it is not in itself considered an attachment disorder under the current classification.<ref name="Lyon-Ruth &amp; Jacobvitz (1999)"/><ref name="Lyons-Ruth et al. (2005)"/>
