The '''Lillesand<U+2013>Flaksvand Line''' ({{lang-no|Lillesand<U+2013>Flaksvandbanen}}) was a {{convert|16.59|km|mi|sp=us|adj=on}} [[railway]] between [[Flaksvand]] and [[Lillesand]] in [[Aust-Agder]], [[Norway]]. The line was built in {{RailGauge|1067}} [[narrow gauge]]  and not connected to the [[rail transport in Norway|national railway network]]. The line opened on 4 June 1896 and remained in use until 15 June 1953. It was built to carry lumber, but also featured a passenger service. Since 1908 the line was unprofitable and only had a limited service. Plans to connect it to the [[S<U+00F8>rland Line]] was rejected.

==Route==
[[File:Lillesand-Flaksvand map.jpg|thumb|Map of the route]]
The {{convert|16.59|km|mi|sp=us}} line was built at a minimum standard and as cheap as possible. It had {{RailGauge|1067}} narrow gauge, with the steepest gradien at 3.33 percent, a minimum curve radius of {{convert|60|m|sp=us}} and a track weight of 60 kilograms per meter.<ref name=a204>Aspenberg (1994): 204</ref>

In Lillesand, the right-of-way has been converted to a road around the city center, although parts have been converted to a pedestrian path. Other parts have been reverted to agricultural land. From Storemyr, {{convert|5|km|sp=us}} from Lillesand, the route went through a forest, and has become an overgrown forestry road. From Eikeland to Teveite, the line has been converted to a hiking trail. At Birkleland, there are few remains of the line, although when leaving the village part of the line is used as a pathway. Further along, the route is disused, but fenced in. The station buildings at Tveite and Flaksvand have been kept, the building at Lillesand has been preserved, while the station at Birkeland was dismounted because it was in the way of a new road.<ref name=a207>Aspenberg (1994): 207</ref>

==History==
Public debate about constructing a railway from Lillesand up the valley following the river [[Torvdalselven]] started in the mid 1880s.<ref name=a203>Aspenberg (1994): 203</ref> At the time, lumber was being floated down the river, but low levels of water was causing irregular operations and the piling of lumber in Flaksvand.<ref>Aspenberg (1994): 203<U+2013>204</ref> In 1889, a group of local investors applied to the government for [[concession (contract)|concession]]. Costs were estimated at NOK&nbsp;462,000 and concession was granted by the [[Parliament of Norway]] on 22 June 1891. At the same time, the line received a state grant of NOK&nbsp;200,000. The line opened on 4 June 1896.<ref name=a203 />

The line started with two [[steam locomotives]] from [[Hartmann]], which were delivered in May 1895 and given the names ''Lillesand'' and ''Flaksvand''. Three passenger cars were bought along with thirty-four freight cars. Most of the rolling stock remained in use until the closing of the line, at which time they were scrapped.<ref name=a204 /> The initial service was two daily round trips, shortly afterwards increasing to three. The peak freight transport was reached in 1902, when 53,207 tonnes were transported.<ref name=a205>Aspenberg (1994): 205</ref> It fell rapidly, and from 1906 it was never higher than 20,000 tonnes. Also the passenger traffic fell, with the peak reached in 1900, with 26,000 passengers.<ref name=a204 /> By 1908, the railway was loosing money, of which two-thirds was covered by the state and one-third by the municipalities.<ref name=a205 />

During the planning of the [[S<U+00F8>rland Line]], it was proposed that the Lillesand<U+2013>Flaksvand Line be converted to standard gauge and extended to [[Oggevatn]], allowing the two lines to connect.<ref name=a205 /> Other proposals involved extending the line from Flaksvand to [[Vennesla]] and from Lillesand to [[Roresand]].<ref name=a207 />

In 1928, the operating company, A/S Lillesand<U+2013>Flaksvandbanen, started a parallel bus route. By 1930, only 845 passengers were transported by rail, with ridership falling further in the following years. By then, there was only a single, combined freight and passenger round trip. From 2 March 1942, this was reduced to when needed, and eventually transport was only done during summer. In 1951, the railway transported 269 passengers and 4,915 tonnes. The last train ran on 15 June 1953, and the line was officially closed on 1 July.<ref name=a205 />
