The '''Red-vented Bulbul''' (''Pycnonotus cafer'') is a member of the [[bulbul]] family of [[passerine]]s.  It is resident breeder across the [[Indian Subcontinent]], including [[Sri Lanka]] extending east to [[Burma]] and parts of [[Tibet]]. It has been introduced in many other parts of the world and has established itself in the wild on several Pacific islands including [[Fiji]], [[Samoa]], Tonga, and [[Hawaii]]. It has also established itself in parts of [[Dubai]], the United Arab Emirates and [[New Zealand]]. It is included in the [[List of the world's 100 worst invasive species|list of the world's 100 worst]] [[invasive species|invasive alien species]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Lowe S., Browne M., Boudjelas S., De Poorter M.|year=2000|title=100 of the World<U+2019>s Worst Invasive Species:A selection from the Global Invasive Species Database.|publisher=The Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG)|url=http://www.issg.org/database/species/reference_files/100English.pdf}}</ref>

The Red-vented Bulbul was originally described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in 1766. Several populations of this widespread species have been named as [[subspecies]] (or races). The nominate race is found in southern India.<ref name=whistler/> The [[Type locality (biology)|type locality]] of [[Puducherry]] was designated by [[Erwin Stresemann]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Stresemann, E.|year=1952 |title=On the birds collected by Pierre Poivre in Canton, Manila, India and Madagascar (1751<U+2013>1756)|journal= Ibis |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=499<U+2013>523|doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1952.tb01847.x}}</ref> The race in the western part is ''intermedius'' and is found in Kashmir and [[Kohat District|Kohat]] down to the [[Salt Range]] and along the Himalayas to Kumaon. The race ''bengalensis'' is found in the Himalayas from Nepal east to Assam. South of these two forms are ''pallidus'' to the west south to [[Ahmednagar]] and ''saturatus'' along the east, south to the [[Godavari]].  There are no distinct boundaries to these racial forms and recent works do not recognize ''pallidus'' and ''saturatus'' (designated by Whistler & Kinnear, 1932 for the northeastern Peninsular India) but accept the desert form ''humayuni'' from Sindh and northwestern India, northeast Indian ''stanfordii'' (=''stanfordi'' Deignan, 1949) and the Sri Lankan race ''haemorrhous'' (=''haemorrhousus'' (J.

==Description==
[[File:Red vented Bulbul I IMG 6303.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Underside of race ''bengalensis'']]
The Red-vented Bulbul is easily identified by its short crest giving the head a squarish appearance. The body is dark brown with a scaly pattern while the head is darker or black. The rump is white while the vent is red. The black tail is tipped in white. The Himalayan races have a more prominent crest and are more streaked on the underside. The Race ''intermedius'' of the Western Himalayas has a black hood extending to the mid-breast. Population ''bengalensis'' of Central and Eastern Himalayas and the Gangetic plain has a dark hood, lacks the scale like pattern on the underside and instead has dark streaks on the paler lower belly. Race ''stanfordi'' of the South Assam hills is similar to ''intermedius''. The desert race ''humayuni'' has a paler brown mantle. The nominate race ''cafer'' is found in Peninsular India. Northeast Indian race ''wetmorei'' is between ''cafer'', ''humayuni'' and ''bengalensis''. about 20&nbsp;cm in length, with a long tail. Sri Lankan race ''haemorrhous'' (=''haemorrhousus''<ref name=ecd/>) has a dark mantle with narrow pale edges. Race ''humayuni'' is known to hybridize with ''[[Pycnonotus leucogenys]]'' and these hybrids were once described as a subspecies ''magrathi'' marked by their pale rumps and yellow-orange or pink vents.<ref>{{cite journal|year=1959|title= Hybridization in some Indian Bulbuls ''Pycnonotus cafer'' x ''P. leucogenys''|journal=Ibis|volume= 101|issue=2|pages=177<U+2013>182|doi= 10.1111/j.1474-919X.1959.tb02373.x|author1=Sibley, CB|author2=Short, LL}}</ref> In eastern Myanmar there is some natural hybridization with ''[[Pycnonotus aurigaster]]''.<ref name=rasmussen>{{cite book|author=Rasmussen PC & Anderton, JC|isbn=8487334679 |year=2005|title=Birds of South Asia: The Ripley Guide|publisher=Smithsonian Institution and Lynx Edicions|page=338}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=A Note on ''Molpastes magrathi'' Whitehead| journal= Ibis| volume=51| issue=2| pages= 302<U+2013>304 | year= 1909| author=Sharpe, R B|url= http://www.archive.org/stream/ibis39brit#page/302/mode/1up| doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1909.tb05264.x}}</ref>

Sexes are similar in plumage, but young birds are duller than adults.<ref name=rasmussen/> The typical call has been transcribed as ''ginger beer'' but a number of sharp single note calls likened as ''pick'' are also produced. Their alarm calls are usually responded to and heeded by many other species of bird.<ref name=hbk/>

==Habitat and distribution==
This is a bird of dry scrub, open forest, plains and cultivated lands.<ref name=rasmussen/> In its native range it is rarely found in mature forests. A study based on 54 localities in India concluded that vegetation is the single most important factor that determines the distribution of the species.<ref>{{cite book|author=Vijayan, VS|year=1975|title= The ecological isolation of Bulbuls (Pycnonotidae) with special reference to ''Pycnonotus cafer cafer'' and ''P. luteolus luteolus'' at Point Calimere, Tamil Nadu.

It has been introduced into Hawaii, Fiji and New Zealand. They were introduced to Samoa in 1943 and became common on Upolu by 1957.
