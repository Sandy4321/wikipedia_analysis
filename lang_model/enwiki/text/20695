'''Premarin''' is the commercial name for compound drug consisting primarily of conjugated [[estrogen]]s. Isolated from [[horse|mare's]] [[urine]] ('''PRE'''gnant '''MAR'''es' ur'''IN'''e), it is manuactured by [[Wyeth]] [[Pharmaceutical]]s and has been marketed since 1942. It is available in both oral (0.4/0.625/1.25mg) and topical form.

==Pharmacology==

The major forms of estrogen in Premarin are [[estrone]] (>50%), [[equilin]] (15-25%) and [[equilenin]]. The estrogens in Premarin are often called "conjugated equine estrogens" (CEE) because the estrogen [[molecule]]s are generally present with [[hydrophilic]] side-groups attached such as [[sulfate]]. Thus, [[estrone sulfate]] is actually the major molecule in Premarin.  Estrone sulfate is easily [[absorption|absorbed]] into the [[blood]] after Premarin [[tablet|pill]]s are taken by [[women]]. Estrone sulfate is [[conversion|converted]] to [[estradiol]], an active estrogen normally found in women. It is not clear if estrogens such as equilin that are foreign to the human body have effects in women that are significantly different from the estrogens like estradiol that are normally made in the human body.

==Indications==

Premarin is indicated for the treatment of mild to severe vasomotor symptoms of the menopause, prevention of [[osteoporosis]], and treatment of vaginal and vulvar atrophy. Premarin has been one of the most widely used drugs in the [[U.S.|United States of America]]. Premarin became the form of estrogen most commonly used for [[hormone replacement therapy]].

==Controversy==

{{POV-section}}
Premarin is the subject of some [[contention]]. [[Animal rights]] activists claim that animal husbandry and urine collection methods used in Premarin's production cause undue stress and suffering to the [[Mare (horse)|mare]]s involved.<ref>[http://premarin.org/ premarin.org site]</ref> Additionally, it is proposed that there is an overabundance of poorly bred foals produced by Pregnant Mare Urine (PMU) farms each year. Since larger horses produce more urine, most Premarin mares are [[draft horse]]s. PMU farmers want to produce smaller [[foal]]s to reduce feed costs therefore most Premarin mares are bred to lighter saddle horse [[stallion]]s rather than draft stallions. The draft cross foals that result are poorly bred and while often make good riding horses are not in great demand by the general riding public. As with cross bred dogs ([[Mixed-breed dog|mutts]]), there are more cross-bred horses than there is demand for them. Some PMU farms attempt to increase the value of their foals by breeding their production mares with good quality and/or "colored" stallions (stallions which are likely to produce interestingly colored offspring like [[American Paint Horse|paint]]s or [[palomino]]s). However, some PMU horses - colored or not - end up bound for [[slaughter house]]s to become [[horse meat]] for human or animal consumption. Although commonly eaten in Europe and Asia, horse meat is considered [[taboo]] in many [[Anglophone]] countries.
