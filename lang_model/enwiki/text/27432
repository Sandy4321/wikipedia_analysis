'''Choudrant''' is a [[village (Louisiana)|village]] in [[Lincoln Parish, Louisiana]], United States. The population was 582 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. It is part of the [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]] [[Ruston micropolitan area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]].

Former [[U.S. Representative]] [[Jerry Huckaby]] has retired to Choudrant.

==Geography==
Choudrant is located at {{Coord|32|31|49|N|92|30|45|W|type:city}} (32.530269, -92.512405){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the village has a total area of {{convert|1.8|mi2|km2|abbr=on}}, all land.

==Economy==
As a village, Choudrant has limited business opportunity. There are several "home grown" businesses within the village limits. Some of the more notable are Parnell's Station, Ken's Mini Mart, Spiller's Service Station, Morrison's Building Supply, Choudrant Appliance, and Doody's Diner. The most prominent of local businesses is Community Trust Bank, originally founded as the Bank of Choudrant. It has since grown to become one of the largest banks in both Lincoln Parish and the neighboring [[Ouachita Parish]]. Despite its growth though, the FDIC still recognizes the original Choudrant branch as its home office. Community Trust also sponsored the [[Louisiana Peach Festival]] in Ruston until 2005, whence sponsorship was taken up by [[Squire Creek Country Club]].

A [[Pilgrim's Pride]] [[poultry]] hatchery in Choudrant was marked for closure early in 2009, along with other company operations in nearby [[Arcadia, Louisiana|Arcadia]] in [[Bienville Parish]], [[Athens, Louisiana|Athens]] in [[Claiborne Parish, Louisiana|Claiborne Parish]], and [[Farmerville, Louisiana|Farmerville]] in [[Union Parish, Louisiana|Union Parish]]. The closures cost this part of North Louisiana some 1,300 jobs.<ref name=pilpr>{{cite web|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/article/20090301/NEWS05/903010307&referrer=FRONTPAGECAROUSEL|title=Greg Hilburn and Robbie Evans, "Pilgrim's Pride decision a bombshell: Sites closing in Arcadia, Athens, Choudrant, Farmerville|work=[[The Times (Shreveport)|Shreveport Times]]|accessdate=March 1, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Several weeks later, however, Pilgrim's Pride accepted an $80 million offer from [[Foster Farms]] of [[California]] to purchase the operations. In addition, to the 1,300 direct jobs in Farmerville, the purchase spares the small farms of some three hundred independent growers. Foster Farms put up $40 million and the State of Louisiana a matching $40 million. Foster Farms will further invest $10 million in capital improvements at the Farmerville plant, to be matched by the state, in an agreement announced by [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Bobby Jindal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20090321/NEWS01/903210309 |title=Saved: 1,300 jobs |publisher=Monroe News Star |date=March 21, 2009|accessdate=March 21, 2009 |author=Greg Hilburn}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Government==
Choudrant is served by four elected officials&mdash;a mayor and three village aldermen. Other public employees include a town clerk and a small police force. For many years, Choudrant was served by only one law enforcement officer, its police chief, but the force has grown in recent years adding additional officers and a canine unit. The Lincoln Parish Sheriff's Office also provides law enforcement services as needed.

Fire protection in the Village is provided by the Choudrant Volunteer Fire Department.

==Education==
Choudrant is located within the fifth district of the [http://www.lincolnschools.org Lincoln Parish School System]. There are two schools within the Choudrant district&mdash;Choudrant Elementary and Choudrant High. The elementary school services between 400 and 450 students in grades K-6 while the high school contains approximately 350 students in grade levels 7-12. Both schools are well known as having high academic achievement under the state's school improvement plan and No Child Left Behind. One sore point for the community is the fact that both school facilities are falling into decline. The high school was rebuilt in 1937 after a fire and has had no substantive renovations or updates since that time. Choudrant Elementary was similarly rebuilt and expanded after a fire in the 1970s, but the student population has outgrown its walls. However, attempts to renovate the high school and rebuild the elementary school were halted in 2007 when citizens of the school district voted by a 2-1 majority against passage of a bond issue to fund such changes.
