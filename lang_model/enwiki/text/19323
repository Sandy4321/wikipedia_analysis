{{other|Haridasa (disambiguation)}}
The '''Haridasa''' ([[Kannada]]: [[wikt:<U+0CB9><U+0CB0><U+0CBF><U+0CA6><U+0CBE><U+0CB8>|<U+0CB9><U+0CB0><U+0CBF><U+0CA6><U+0CBE><U+0CB8>]]) devotional movement is considered as one of the turning points in the cultural history of [[India]]. Over a span of nearly six centuries, several saints and mystics helped shape the culture, philosophy and art of [[South India]] and [[Karnataka]] in particular by exerting considerable spiritual influence over the masses and kingdoms that ruled South India.<ref name="spread">Sharma (1961), p514</ref>

This movement was ushered in by the ''Haridasas'' ({{lang-kn|<U+0CB9><U+0CB0><U+0CBF><U+0CA6><U+0CBE><U+0CB8><U+0CB0><U+0CC1>}}, literally meaning 'servants of Lord [[Hari]]') and took shape in the 13th century - 14th century CE, period, prior to and during the early rule of the [[Vijayanagara]] empire.  The main objective of this movement was to propagate the [[Dvaita]] philosophy of [[Madhvacharya]] (''Madhva Siddhanta'') to the masses through a literary medium known as ''Dasa Sahitya'' (literature of the servants of the Lord).<ref name="hari1"/>

Prominent [[Hindu]] philosophers, poets and scholars like [[Sripadaraya]], [[Vyasathirtha]], [[Vadirajatirtha]], [[Purandara Dasa]] and [[Kanaka Dasa]] played an important role during this time.<ref name="hari1">Kamath (2001), p155</ref> Though the movement found its roots in the  [[Kannada]] country and later spread to other parts of South India, it was a net result of earlier devotional movements like the [[Veerashaiva]] movement (of [[Vachana|Vachana literature]] in Kannada) of northern Karnataka led by [[Basavanna]] in the 12th century and the [[Alvar]] saints of [[Tamil Nadu]] during the 10th century.<ref name="hari4"/><ref name="imm">Krishna Rao M.V.

Their devotees started the worldwide [[ISKCON]] movement.<ref name="hari2">Kamath (2001), p156</ref>

The Haridasas were saints, some of who were wandering bards, and considered themselves as slaves of the supreme Lord - [[Hari]]. While the movement was mainly heralded by the [[Brahmins]], it was a [[devotional]] one whose ideals and thoughts pervaded and received noteworthy contributions from all sections of society.<ref name="kan">According to some accounts, Kanakadasa came from a family of hunters (''beda'') and from other accounts, from a family of Shepherds (''kuruba'') (Sastri 1955, p365)</ref> The Haridasa movement can be considered as a part of a larger ''[[Bhakti]]'' movement whose devotional inspiration to the masses lasted over a millennium making significant contribution to Kannada devotional literature.<ref name="bhak">Sastri (1955), p381</ref>

==Origin==
The origin of the Haridasa movement is not clearly known, with some legends indicating that there were holy men and kings who espoused this form of devotion as early as the 9th century. However it is well known that the great [[Vaishnava]] religious devotionalism called ''Dasa Kuta'' found its organizational base and started to produce large congregation of devotees in the [[Karnataka]] region, largely due to the [[Vedanta]] propounded in the 13th century by [[Madhvacharya]] of [[Udupi]] (1238 - 1317 CE).<ref name="hari4">{{cite web|title=History of Haridasas|url=http://www.dvaita.org/haridasa/overview/hist.html|author=Madhusudana Rao CR|publisher=Dvaita Home Page|work=|accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref>

The Haridasas' who propagated the philosophy (''Vedanta'') of Madhvacharya belonged to two groups; the ''Dasakuta'', who conveyed the philosophy of Madhvacharya in simple and lucid [[Kannada]] to the masses and the ''Vyasakuta'', who were required to be proficient in the [[Vedas]], [[Upanishad]]s and other ''Darshanas''{{Clarifyme|date=April 2008}}.<ref name="Kuta">{{cite web|title=The Haridasa Movement|url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/states/history/historyofkarnataka37.htm|author=Arthikaje|publisher=ourKarnataka.com|work=History of Karnataka|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> During this period, this movement became a strong [[Spirituality|spiritual]] force which helped a resurgence of a strong [[Hindu]] sentiment in Southern India, when Northern India was already under [[Muslim]] rule. The Haridasas' found state patronage in the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] which ruled over entire [[South India|Southern India]] at its peak.<ref name="hari3">Kamath (2001), p178</ref> Vyasatirtha was intimately associated with the empire and was considered the family deity (''Kuladevata'') by King [[Krishnadevaraya]].<ref name="raj1">{{cite web|last=Pujar|first=Narahari S.|coauthors=Shrisha Rao and H.P.

Haridasas' belonged to the [[Vaishnava]] school of [[Hinduism]] and worshipped [[Vitthala]], a manifestation of [[Vishnu]] and all forms of [[Krishna]].<ref name="vai">{{cite web|title=Dasa Sahitya or Slave Literature|url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/kar/literature/dasa.htm|author=Kamat, Jyotsna|publisher=Kamat's Potpourri|work=History of Kannada literature|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> The Vittalanatha temple at [[Pandharapur]]a on the bank of the river [[Bhima]] in present day [[Maharashtra]], the Vittala Swami temples at [[Hampi]] in [[Karnataka]] and the [[Srinivasa]] temple on [[Tirumala]] hills in [[Andhra Pradesh]] are considered the holiest of places in the Haridasa context.

==Preachers==
The Haridasas' generally hailed from places in present day [[Karnataka]], but there were some exceptions like [[Jayatirtha]] who came from Mangalvedhe near  [[Pandharapur]]a in modern [[Maharashtra]]<ref name="mangal">{{cite web|title=Sri Jaya Tirtha|url=http://www.dvaita.org/scholars/jayatirtha/|author=Pujar, Rao and Budihal|work=Online Webpage of Haridasa (dvaita.org)|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> and Sri [[Naraharitirtha]] (a disciple of Madhvacharya) who was a native of either [[Andhra Pradesh]] or [[Orissa]].<ref name="hail1">{{cite web|title=Sri Narahari Tirtha|url=http://www.dvaita.org/haridasa/yathi/narahari.html|author=Mahushudhana Rao C R|work=Online Webpage of Haridasa (dvaita.org)|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> Naraharitirtha (1281), a minister in the court of Kalinga was inducted into the Madhvacharya order. He composed many early devotional hymns in praise of Vishnu in Kannada language, some of which are available today.<ref name="nara">Sastri (1955), p364</ref> While the Srikurmam inscription indicates that Naraharitirtha may have been the originator of this devotional movement, the songs of the Haridasas' give credit to [[Sripadaraya]] as the real founder of the movement in the 15th century.<ref name="hail1"/>   

Famous haridasas from the Madhvacharya order during the [[Vijayanagar empire]] period were:
* Madhavatirtha 
* Akshobhyatirtha
* Vijayindratirtha 
* Raghottamatirtha
* Naraharitirtha
* Jayatirtha
* Sripadaraya (1404 - 1502 CE.)
* Vyasatirtha (1447 - 1539 CE.)
* Purandara Dasa (1480 - 1564 CE.)
* Kanaka Dasa (1508 - 1606 CE.) (non-brahmin saint)
* Vadirajatirtha (1480 - 1600 CE.) (lived for 120 years).

==Growth and Patronage==
Sripadaraya, Vyasatirtha and Vadirajatirtha are called "three great saints" (''yathi trayaru'') in Haridasa movement where as the epithet "great trinity of Vaishnava composers" from Karnataka goes to Sripadaraya, Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa, though it is difficult to separate literature, music, devotion from their composite writings.<ref name="trin">{{cite web|title=Dasa Sahitya or Slave Literature|url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/kar/literature/dasa.htm|author=Kamat, Jyotsna Dr.|publisher=Kamat's Potpourri|work=History of Kannada Literature|accessdate=2007-06-02}}</ref> The center of their activity in the 15th century and 16th century was [[Hampi]], the sacred centre of [[Vijayanagara]], the regal capital of Vijayanagara empire.

The Haridasa movement gained further impetus in the 17th century and 18th century in and around [[Raichur District]] and some of the great saints from this era were [[Guru Raghavendra]], [[Vijaya Dasa]], Gopala Dasa, Jagannatha Dasa, Prasanna Venkata Dasa, Pranesha Dasa, Venugopala Dasa, Mahipathi Dasa, Mohana Dasa, Helevanakatte Giriamma and Harapanhalli Bhimavva.<ref name="renai">{{cite web|title=The Haridasa Movement|url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/states/history/historyofkarnataka38.htm|author=Arthikaje|publisher=ourKarnataka.com|work=History of Karnataka|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref><ref name="renai1">{{cite web|title=History of the Haridasas|url=http://www.dvaita.org/haridasa/overview/hist.html|author=Rao, Madhusudana C.R.|publisher=www.dvaita.org|work=|accessdate=2007-06-02}}</ref>

The history of the Haridasa movement from the 13th century to the present day is the history of spreading ''[[Bhakti|Hari bhakti]]'' (devotion to ''Hari''-God) to the common man and in that purpose has contributed immensely to [[Kannada literature]] and to the development of Kannada language. Both the Haridasa and Veerashaiva movements pervade the length and breadth of Karnataka and exert ennobling influences upon the neighboring provinces of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Maharashtra]].<ref name="nam"/>

==Contribution to Kannada Literature==
[[Image:Purandara.jpg|thumb|right|Purandara Dasa]]
Haridasa movement has made a significant contribution towards [[Kannada literature]] by spawning a whole corpus of devotional literature in the form of verses, hymns and musical compositions, rendering the spread of the [[Dvaita]] philosophy (''Vedanta'') postulated by Madhvacharya.<ref name="spread"/><ref name="hari5">Their poems were in ''ragale'' metre (Sastri 1955, p365)</ref>  The literature that originated from this devotional movement is called ''Dasa Sahitya'' (or ''dasara padagalu'' - literature of the ''dasas''). These various compositions are generally called as ''Devaranamas'' (literally meaning ''names of the Lord'') and are sung in the praise of the Lord [[Hari]]. All these compositions have the concept of ''[[Bhakti|Hari Bhakti]]'' (devotion to God) at their core and they usually revolve around references to [[Hindu]] mythology and the Dvaita philosophy. Some Haridasas like Purandara Dasa and Kanaka Dasa also composed several ''Devaranamas'' using the day-to-day happenings, morals and virtues as the central theme.<ref name="nam">Kamath (2001), p155</ref> These compositions were in the Kannada language since the main objective of this movement was to take the devotional philosophy to the common man.<ref name="common">Sharma (1961), p515</ref><ref name="nam"/> In doing so, the common people were also educated in the importance of consciousness (''jnana''), devotion (''bhakti''), ethics and Hindu religion. Their hymns (''padas'') set to various musical tones (''ragas'') aroused the frevor among the masses. As advocates of religious reform, the Haridasas' propounded the virtues of detachment (''vairagya''). [[Similes]] and [[metaphors]] were used to great effect in achieving this and they are found in abundance in songs and hymns.<ref name="vai">Sharma (1961), p515</ref> In addition to devotional songs, Kanaka Dasa authored five literary classical writings in the [[kavya]] style.<ref name="kav">{{cite web|title=Kanakadasa - Poet among Saints |url=http://www.kamat.com/indica/faiths/bhakti/kanakadasa.htm|author=Kamat, Jytosna Dr.|work=Kamats Potpourri-Path of devotion|accessdate=2007-06-02}}</ref> Jagannathadasa, [[Vijaya Dasa]] and Gopaladasa etc., are more well known among a galaxy of composers who made rich contributions to Kannada literature.<ref name="gal">{{cite web|title=Haridasa Lineage|url=http://www.dvaita.org/haridasa/general/das_map.html|author=Madhusudana Rao CR|publisher=Dvaita Home Page (www.dviata.org)|work=|accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref><ref name="gal1">{{cite web|title=Yathidasa Lineage|url=http://www.dvaita.org/haridasa/general/yathi_map.html|author=Madhusudana Rao CR|publisher=Dvaita Home Page (www.dviata.org)|work=|accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref>

The compositions can be broadly classified under one of the following three types:
:* Kavya or poetic compositions
:* Tatva or philosophic compositions
:* General compositions.

==Contribution to Carnatic music==
The Haridasa movement developed the [[Carnatic music]] tradition as a distinct art form from the [[Hindustani music|Hindustani]] style thereby heralding a renaissance in the world of Indian [[classical music]]. [[Purandara Dasa]], one of the foremost of Haridasas' is known as the "Father of carnatic music" (''Karnataka Sangeeta Pitamaha'') for his invaluable contributions to this art form.<ref name="father">Owing to his contributions to carnatic music, Purandaradasa is known as ''Karnataka Sangita Pitamaha'' {{cite web|title=Purandara Dasa|url=http://www.kamat.com/indica/faiths/bhakti/purandara.htm|author=Dr. Jytosna Kamat|publisher=Kamats Potpourri|work=|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref><ref name="father1">{{cite web|title=Sri Purandara Dasaru|url=http://www.dvaita.org/haridasa/dasas/purandara/purandara.html|author=Madhusudana Rao CR|publisher=Dvaita Home Page|work=|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref><ref name="father2">{{cite web|title=History of Music|url=http://carnatica.net/origin.htm|author=S.

He codified and consolidated the teaching of Carnatic music by evolving several steps like ''sarali'', ''jantai'', ''thattu varisai'', ''alankara'' and ''geetham'' and laid down a framework for imparting formal training in this art form.<ref name="tattu">Iyer (2006), p93</ref> The structure and lessons he formulated four centuries ago remain the foundation for all students of carnatic music. Apart from Purandara Dasa, several later Haridasas' composed songs adhering to the same musical and philosophical traditions. Their compositions usually fell in one of the following categories: ''Padagalu'' (or ''Devaranama''- devotional hymns), ''Kriti'', ''Ugabhoga'', ''Suladi'', ''Vruttanama'', ''Dandaka'', ''Tripadi'' (three line poetry), ''Pattadi'', ''Sangathya''<ref name="sang"> Sangatya composition is meant to be sung to the accompaniment of a musical instrument (Sastri 1955, p359)</ref> and ''[[Ragale]]'' (lyrical verses in blank verse). These forms of composition are still prevalent in [[South India]] and especially in [[Karnataka]].

Though these compositions usually adhere to the carnatic style of music, some of these compositions have also been sung in the [[Hindustani music|Hindustani]] style by musicians such as [[Bhimsen Joshi]] and [[Gangubai Hangal]].
