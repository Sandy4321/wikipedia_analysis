{{Music of Final Fantasy}}

The ''[[Chocobo (series)|Chocobo]]'' [[video game]] series is a [[spin-off]] series composed of over a dozen games developed by [[Square Co.]] and later by [[Square Enix]] featuring a [[super deformed]] version of the [[Chocobo]], a ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series [[mascot]] and fictional [[bird]], as the [[protagonist]]. Several of the titles have received separate album releases of music from the game.  The '''discography of the ''Chocobo'' series''' includes soundtrack albums for the ''Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon'' sub-series<U+2014>comprising ''[[Chocobo (series)#Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon|Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon]]'', ''[[Chocobo (series)#Chocobo's Dungeon 2|Chocobo's Dungeon 2]]'', and ''[[Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo's Dungeon]]''<U+2014>and soundtrack albums of music from ''[[Chocobo Racing]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo Tales]]'', and ''[[Chocobo (series)#Chocobo to Mah<U+014D> no Ehon: Maj<U+014D> to Sh<U+014D>jo to Gonin no Y<U+016B>sha|Chocobo and the Magic Picture Book: The Witch, The Maiden, and the Five Heroes]]'', as well as an album of [[arrangement|arranged]] music from ''Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon'' and a [[single (music)|single]] entitled ''Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Toki Wasure No Meikyuu: Door Crawl'' for the vocal theme song of ''Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo's Dungeon''.

The first album of the discography released was the soundtrack to ''Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon'', ''Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Original Soundtrack''. It was released by [[DigiCube]] in 1997 and was reprinted by Square Enix in 2006. An arranged album of music from that game was released in under the title ''Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Coi Vanni Gialli'' by DigiCube in 1998, and soundtrack albums to ''Chocobo's Dungeon 2'' and ''Chocobo Racing'' were released the following year, also by DigiCube. There were no further album releases in the series until 2006, when Square Enix produced a download-only soundtrack to ''Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo Tales''.  The latest releases in the series are the soundtrack to ''Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo's Dungeon'' and a combined soundtrack for ''Chocobo Tales'' and ''The Witch, The Maiden, and the Five Heroes'', both of which were released by Square Enix in 2008.

== Concept and creation ==

[[Masashi Hamauzu]], the composer for ''Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon'', was not expecting to be assigned the soundtrack to the game.  In the liner notes for the original soundtrack album, he states that he was "still in high school when that lovable character first made his debut in Final Fantasy", but that the "Chocobo Theme" made a big impression on him, leading him to often think to himself that he would "love to try doing this kind of work".<ref name="liner1">Hamauzu, Masashi. ''Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Original Soundtrack'' Liner Notes. [[DigiCube]]. SSCX-10014. December 21, 1997</ref> The soundtrack was the first solo album that Hamauzu had produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/composers/hamauzu/sep03interview.shtml|title=Interview with Masashi Hamauzu (RocketBaby - September 2003)|publisher=Square Enix Music Online|accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> When he wrote his own Chocobo themes for the ''Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Original Soundtrack'', he decided to arrange the opening and ending of the album for a fifty-piece orchestra, which lead to the creation of the orchestrated ''Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Coi Vanni Gialli'' album.  In the liner notes for that album, he explains that his motivation for creating the orchestral works was because "Demand for [[classical music]] in Japan is still low compared with other countries" and he wanted "to spread the word on this style of music by any means necessary". He ends the note by exhorting his listeners to "take your time" with classical music such as the album, so that one day they will appreciate it.<ref name="liner2">Hamauzu, Masashi. ''Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Coi Vanni Gialli'' Liner Notes. [[DigiCube]]. SSCX-10016. December 21, 1997</ref>

Hamauzu has not been involved in the production of any other ''Chocobo'' soundtracks. ''Chocobo's Dungeon 2'''s soundtrack was composed by a group of five composers, and was the last ''Chocobo'' game soundtrack to not be mainly composed of remixes of previous ''Final Fantasy'' and ''Chocobo'' songs.<ref name="RPGFCMD2"/> Hamauzu was not involved in the creation of either the remixes or original tracks for these albums. His role was filled by [[Kumi Tanioka]] for ''Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo's Dungeon'', [[Kenji Ito]] for ''Chocobo Racing'', and Yuzo Takahashi for ''Chocobo and the Magic Picture Book: The Witch, The Maiden, and the Five Heroes''.<ref name="RPGFFFF"/><ref name="SEMOCR"/><ref name="SEMOMB"/>

Unlike the soundtracks to the numbered ''Final Fantasy'' games, no songs from the ''Chocobo'' soundtracks have appeared in any [[List of Final Fantasy compilation albums|compilation albums]] produced by Square Enix. Songs from the series have also not appeared in any of the official ''Final Fantasy'' music concerts.

The album included a bonus [[mini-CD]] containing two orchestral arrangements of the main theme.  Both the opening and ending themes of the soundtrack are orchestrated, while the rest of the tracks use a [[synthesizer]]; the songs have been described as "very upbeat" and "fun-lovin' light-hearted".<ref name="RPGFCMD1">{{cite web | author=Gann, Patrick| title=Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon OST | publisher=[[RPGFan]] | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/chocod/index.html | date=2000-12-19 | accessdate=2009-02-19}}</ref> Five of the tracks incorporate the "Chocobo Theme" from the ''Final Fantasy'' series as part of the song, namely "Chocobo's House", "Chocobo Village", "After the Battle", "Let's Have a Dream", and "Courage".

''Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Original Soundtrack'' was well received by critics; Patrick Gann of [[RPGFan]] praised it, saying that it could be "some of the most creative musical work to come from Squaresoft" and that the album was full of "very upbeat and fun-lovin' light-hearted goodness from Hamauzu."<ref name="RPGFCMD1"/> He especially liked the included mini-CD, claiming that it made the album "a worthwhile purchase on its own".<ref name="RPGFCMD1"/> Kero Hazel of Square Enix Music Online agreed, terming the album a "solid winner" and praising its ability to be enjoyed both as background music and with active listening.<ref name="SEMOCMD1">{{cite web | author=Hazel, Kero| title=Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon Original Soundtrack: Review by Kero Hazel | publisher=Square Enix Music Online| url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/reviews/kerohazel/chocobodungeon.shtml | accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> Hazel also praised Hamauzu's "flexible" use of the "Chocobo" theme.<ref name="SEMOCMD1"/> Dave of Square Enix Music Online, however, while still recommending the album as a "good score", felt that the lighter themes of the soundtrack were lacking in depth, leaving the darker themes to "provide the listener with any substance".<ref name="SEMOCMD12">{{cite web | author=Dave| title=Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon Original Soundtrack: Review by Dave | publisher=Square Enix Music Online| url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/reviews/dave/chocobodungeon.shtml | accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>

==== Chocobo's Dungeon 2 ====

''Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon 2 Original Soundtrack'' is the soundtrack for ''[[Chocobo's Dungeon 2]]''. It was composed by [[Kumi Tanioka]], Yasuhiro Kawakami, [[Tsuyoshi Sekito]], [[Kenji Ito]], and [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. It was released by DigiCube on January 21, 1999. The album contains all of the tracks from the game, as well as two tracks used in television commercials for ''Chocobo's Dungeon 2''. The album has been described as "light-hearted", with "no real driving songs".<ref name="RPGFCMD2">{{cite web | author=Gann, Patrick| title=Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon 2 OST | publisher=[[RPGFan]] | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/chocod2/index.html | date=2000-10-15 | accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref> The album is 45 tracks on only one disc, and has a duration of 1:05:40.<ref name="RPGFCMD2"/>

''Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon 2 Original Soundtrack'' was moderately well received by reviewers.  Patrick Gann said that despite the flaws of the game, the soundtrack "held strong" and claimed that anyone could enjoy the album, "given the right atmosphere".<ref name="RPGFCMD2"/> Chris of Square Enix Music Online termed it "a decent effort" and a "coherent and thorough work".<ref name="SEMOCMD2">{{cite web | author=Chris| title=Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon 2 Original Soundtrack: Review by Chris | publisher=Square Enix Music Online| url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/reviews/chris/chocobodungeon2.shtml | accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> He especially praised the contributions of Sekito and Ito, though he was termed the tracks from Kawakami and Tanioka "unmemorable". He concluded that while there were no poor tracks on the album, several of the themes were "limited thematically and emotionally" and he could not recommend the soundtrack to a wide audience.<ref name="SEMOCMD2"/>

==== Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo's Dungeon ====

''Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Toki Wasure No Meiky<U+016B> Original Soundtrack'' is the soundtrack for {{nihongo|''[[Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo's Dungeon]]''|<U+30C1><U+30E7><U+30B3><U+30DC><U+306E><U+4E0D><U+601D><U+8B70><U+306A><U+30C0><U+30F3><U+30B8><U+30E7><U+30F3> <U+6642><U+5FD8><U+308C><U+306E><U+8FF7><U+5BAE>|Chokobo no Fushigi na Danjon Toki Wasure no Meiky<U+016B>|lit. ''Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon: The Labyrinth of Forgotten Time''}}, which features remixes of various ''Final Fantasy'' music. It was arranged by Yuzo Takahashi of Joe Down Studio, a [[Hokkaido]]-based music development studio. The title track and opening theme<U+2014>both original to the soundtrack<U+2014>were composed by [[Kumi Tanioka]], while the final track "Door Crawl" was written and sung by [[Ai Kawashima]]. Other composers whose works were used are Nobuo Uematsu, Naoshi Mizuta, Masashi Hamauzu, Junya Nakano, and Kenji Ito.<ref name="RPGFFFF">{{cite web | author=Jeriaska| title=Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon ~Labyrinth of Forgotten Time~ OST | publisher=[[RPGFan]] | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/chocod-time/index.html | date=2008-03-14 | accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref>

The album was well received by critics such as Jeriaska of RPGFan, who enjoyed the arrangements, particularly those of songs from games early in the ''Final Fantasy'' series.<ref name="RPGFFFF"/> He praised Joe Down Studios for not falling into the trap of "introducing a veneer of self-importance" that he felt was common in remakes of early ''Final Fantasy'' songs.<ref name="RPGFFFF"/> Chris of Square Enix Music Online also liked the album, saying that the arrangements "make many tracks sound better than they've ever sounded before".<ref name="SEMOFFF">{{cite web | author=Chris| title=Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon: Labyrinth of Forgotten Time Original Soundtrack: Review by Chris | publisher=Square Enix Music Online| url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/reviews/chris/chocobodungeon3.shtml | accessdate=2009-03-20}}</ref> His largest complaint about the album was that it does not include every track from the game, some of which he was interested in hearing.  He ascribed the exclusions to the publisher's desire to release the soundtrack as a single disc, and concluded that the album was still a "very enjoyable overall experience".<ref name="SEMOFFF"/>

"Door Crawl", the vocal theme song of ''Chocobo's Dungeon'', was released as a single entitled ''Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Toki Wasure No Meikyuu: Door Crawl''. The album was released by [[Toshiba EMI]] on December 12, 2007. It has a length of 14:18, and contains three tracks.  The title track, {{nihongo|"Door Crawl"|<U+30C9><U+30A2><U+30AF><U+30ED><U+30FC><U+30EB>|}}, is joined by {{nihongo|"Colorless Thing"|<U+8272><U+306E><U+306A><U+3044><U+3082><U+306E>|"Iro no Nai Mono"}} and {{nihongo|"Light"|<U+706F>|"Tomoshibi"}}, both unrelated to ''Chocobo's Dungeon''.  The disc was Kawashima's 15th single; it reached #20 on the [[Oricon]] Weekly Charts and sold 6,520 copies in its first week.<ref name="SEDC">{{cite web | author=Lex | title=Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon: Door Crawl - Ai Kawashima: Review by Lex | publisher=Square Enix Music Online | url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/reviews/lex/chocobodungeonsingle.shtml | date=2000-10-15 | accessdate=2009-02-24}}</ref> Lex of Square Enix Music Online had mixed feelings about the single, saying that "Door Crawl" was "a pleasant and laid back listen", but that "Colorless Thing" was "nothing special" and that "Light" was "ruined" by the synth instruments.<ref name="SEDC"/>

The album is 30 tracks and 57:00 long.<ref name="SEMOCR">{{cite web | author=Kie| title=Chocobo Racing Original Soundtrack: Review by Kie | publisher=Square Enix Music Online | url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/reviews/kie/chocoboracing.shtml | accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref> The only original theme in the soundtrack is "Treasure Chest of the Heart", a Japanese vocal song orchestrated by [[Shirou Hamaguchi]] and performed by [[Hiromi Ohta]]. In the English version of the game, it is performed by Vicki Bell.<ref name="SCSOUND">{{cite web | author=Lau, Aaron | title=Chocobo Racing Original Soundtrack | publisher=Soundtrack Central | date= 1999-08-25 | url=http://www.soundtrackcentral.com/cds/chocoboracing_ost.htm | accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref> The remaining tracks are arrangements of ''Final Fantasy'' songs.  The predominant theme to the tracks selected is the Chocobo theme from the ''Final Fantasy'' series, with eight of the tracks based on it.<ref name="SEMOCR"/> The album was appreciated by Kie of Square Enix Music Online, who felt that Ito's "arrangements of classic themes are done with great skill".<ref name="SEMOCR"/> He especially liked "Mithril Mines" and "Treasure Chest of the Heart", but felt that many of the tracks did not match up to the quality of the best few.<ref name="SEMOCR"/>

=== Chocobo and the Magic Books ===

The ''Chocobo and the Magic Books'' mini-series comprises ''Chocobo to Mahou no Ehon'', released in North America as ''[[Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo Tales]]'' and literally translating to ''Chocobo and the Magic Picture Book'', as well as its to-date Japan-only sequel, ''Chocobo to Mah<U+014D> no Ehon: Maj<U+014D> to Sh<U+014D>jo to Gonin no Y<U+016B>sha'', translated as ''Chocobo and the Magic Picture Book: The Witch, The Maiden, and the Five Heroes''. Neither game has received a separate full soundtrack release; ''Chocobo Tales'' produced a download-only album on [[iTunes]] titled ''The Best of Chocobo and the Magic Book Original Soundtrack'', while together their soundtracks were released in full as the two-disc ''Chocobo and the Magic Books Original Soundtrack''.  The majority of the tracks are either unchanged versions or arrangements of ''Final Fantasy'' and ''Chocobo'' songs; ''Chocobo Tales'' contains only two original tracks<U+2014>one of which is only eight seconds long<U+2014>while its sequel has 12 original tracks out of 33.  The soundtracks for both games were composed by Yuzo Takahashi.  ''Magic Books'' contains 61 tracks across two discs, with a total length of 1:51:57; ''Best of'''s 10 tracks span 26:16.  The tracks in ''Best of'' correspond to tracks 8, 1, 3, 9, 19, 25, 12, 18, 27, and 28 of the first disc of ''Magic Books'', in that order.<ref name="SEMOMB">{{cite web | author=Chris| title=Chocobo and the Magic Books Original Soundtrack: Review by Chris | publisher=Square Enix Music Online | url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/reviews/chris/chocobods.shtml | accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref><ref name="SEMOBOMB">{{cite web | author=Chris| title=The Best of Chocobo and the Magic Book Original Soundtrack: Review by Chris | publisher=Square Enix Music Online | url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/reviews/chris/chocobopicturebook.shtml | accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref>

While neither album has seen much attention from critics, ''The Best of Chocobo and the Magic Book Original Soundtrack'' was dismissed by Chris of Square Enix Music Online as "not a worthwhile sampler" of the soundtrack.<ref name="SEMOBOMB"/> Terming it a "truncated compilation", he criticized the track selection as including what were in his opinion some of the weakest arrangements while excluding the strongest, and concluded that the album serves no purpose given the subsequent release of the full soundtrack as part of ''The Best of Chocobo and the Magic Book Original Soundtrack''.<ref name="SEMOBOMB"/> He was much more complimentary of the ''Magic Books'' album, saying that it "confirmed that Yuzo Takahashi is a bright young composer" and calling the arrangements and original songs "both melodically engaging and stylistically versatile".<ref name="SEMOMB"/>
