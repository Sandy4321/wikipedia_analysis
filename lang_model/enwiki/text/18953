==Life==

===Early life===
George Juskalian was born in [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts|Fitchburg]], [[Massachusetts]] on June 7, 1914 and was the youngest son of Armenian parents Kevork Juskalian (1861<U+2013>1938) and Maritza Ferrahian (1876<U+2013>1960).<ref name=Mirror>{{cite news|last=Melkonian|first=Hovsep M.|title=US Government Honors the Late Col.

He was then invited to serve in the Persian Consulate in Mezire until he was recalled by the Turkish government to serve as supervisor of eleven villages in the region of Kharpert. However, Kevork Juskalian felt that there was no securing future for him in the Ottoman Empire and subsequently fled the Ottoman Empire to United States arriving in [[Ellis Island]] on November 15, 1887. Consequently, the Juskalian family became one of the first Armenians to come to the United States.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=340}} Kevork would find a job at the Iver Johnson Arms & Cycle Works in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] Massachusetts. He was also instrumental in the establishment of the Armenian Church of Our Savior on January 18, 1891. In 1893 Kevork returned to Kharpert and Married Maritza Ferrahian, daughter of Krikor and Yeghisapet (Yesayan) Ferrahian. Due to the [[Hamidian Massacres]], Kevork and Maritza returned to the United States and Kevork rejoined the Iver Johnson Arms & Cycle Works company.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=341}} George Juskalian was also the cousin of famed Medal of Honor recipient of the U.S. Army,  [[Ernest Dervishian]].

Juskalian, who grew up in [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts|Fitchburg]], attended the local schools and graduated from Fitchburg High School in 1932. In 1936 he continued his education at [[Boston University]] graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in journalism.

===Active service===
While studying at the [[Boston University]], as a 2nd Lieutenant in the [[US Army Reserve]], Juskalian was earning a commission through the [[Reserve Officers Training Corps]].<ref name=Mirror />

In June 1936, Juskalian was assigned to [[Fort Devens]], [[Massachusetts]] for a year of active duty with the regular army's 13th Regiment.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=342}}

After a year at Fort Devens, he was assigned administrative officer of a [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] camp at [[Brewster, Massachusetts|Brewster]], [[Massachusetts]]. At Brewster, Juskalian and others were instrumental in the building of a national park.<ref name=Connection1 /> In 1938 after taking a government exam, Juskalian became a fingerprint classifier for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations]] (FBI). Among his most notable searches were of the top 10 Most Wanted such as [[John Dillinger]].<ref name=Connection1 />
[[File:George Juskalian and son.jpg|thumbnail|left|George Juskalian and his son Kevork]]
After returning from active service and when in the midst of pursuing a law degree at the [[American University]], Juskalian's father died.<ref name=Connection1>{{cite news|title=Recollections of a War Veteran|url=http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/news/2004/jun/09/recollections-of-a-war-veteran/|accessdate=31 March 2013|newspaper=The Virginia Connection|date=June 9, 2004}}</ref> Juskalian was ultimately obliged to give up his plans to become a law student and returned to Fitchburg in 1939 to reunite with his mother and assist his brother-in-law in his dry-cleaning business.<ref name=Connection1 /> Thereafter, he decided to volunteer for active service for the [[United States Army]] in the same year.

George Juskalian was assigned as 1st lieutenant and in November 1940 was called to active duty at [[Fort Devens]], [[Massachusetts]] with a salary of $120 a month.<ref name=Connection1 /> With the establishment of the 1st Infantry Division, Juskalian was given command of a 200 man company.<ref name=Connection1 /> The Division would eventually be famous for conducting the Carolina Maneuvers which was a preparatory exercise for the World War II effort.<ref name=Connection1 />

In the summer of 1941 Col. [[Theodore Roosevelt Jr.]], [[Teddy Roosevelt]]'s oldest son, became commander of Juskalian's 26th Infantry Regiment.<ref name=Connection1 />

In February 1942 Juskalian's rank was promoted to Captain and his group was put under test in [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (state)|Georgia]]. In August 1942, Juskalian was one of the 20,000 soldiers of the Division that would board the [[RMS Queen Mary]] and be sent to participate in the war effort.<ref name=Connection1 />

Juskalian would eventually serve in the military and participate in the Korean War, Vietnam War and World War II. He would retire in 1967 with the rank of [[Colonel]].

George Juskalian married Beatrice MacDougall, the widow of his former first company commander Lt. Jack W. Kirk.<ref>{{cite news|title=Beatrice Juskalian|accessdate=30 March 2013|newspaper=The Berkshire Eagle|date=March 29, 2011|quote=There she met and married Lt. Jack W. Kirk who was subsequently killed in action in Africa during World War II. Lt. Kirk was the recipient of two Silver Stars and the Purple Heart. She later married Col. George Juskalian who passed away July 4, 2010. Col. Juskalian was Lt. Kirk's first company commander and was also awarded two Silver Stars and the Legion of Merit for service during World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. They were divorced in 1958.}}</ref> The marriage would ultimately end in divorce in 1958.

When returning to the United States after the war, Juskalian accepted an appointment in the regular army and was promoted to lieutenant colonel.<ref name=International>{{cite journal|last=Mooradian|first=Moorad|title=Military: Arms and the Man|journal=Armenian International Magazine|date=November 30, 1991|volume=2|issue=10|accessdate=28 March 2013|location=Glendale, CA|issn=10503471}}</ref> He was then reported to the Pentagon for duty in the Office of the Secretary of the Army Chief of Staff, General [[Dwight D.

====Visit to Kharpert====
After his mission from Iran, Juskalian visited Kharpert, his father's birthplace. He wrote an article about the trip entitled "Harput Revisited," which appeared in the Spring, April 1959 issue of the Armenian Review, published by the Hairenik Association.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Juskalian|first=George|title=Harput Revisited|journal=Armenian Review|year=1959|month=Spring|volume=12|issue=1|pages=3<U+2013>14|accessdate=1 April 2013|language=Hairenik}}</ref> Juskalian describes his trip in brief:{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=372}}
{{quotation|I tried in vain to locate my parents' home. Mezireh, as a community, was alive and well. Harput (Kharpert), on the other hand was dead, a bleak landscape of debris where once proudly stood a college, schools, churches, shops and homes. There was not even a grave over which to weep and pray for the souls of those from whom I came.}}

===Post-retirement from Army===
[[File:Colonel-Juskalian.jpg|thumbnail|right|George Juskalian with his wife Lucine in 2008]]
After retiring from the Army in 1967, Juskalian settled in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]], [[Virginia]]. In 1970 he would eventually marry his second wife Lucine Barsoumian, an Armenian from [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]].<ref name=Bonnie2 /> They had a son named Kevork and a daughter Elissa.

Juskalian became the graduate admissions director at the [[Southeastern University (Washington, D.C.)|Southeastern University]] of [[Washington D.C.]] for eight years and attained a master's degree in business and public administration with honors from there in 1977 at the age of sixty.<ref name=Bonnie2 />

He was a member of many veterans organizations including the American Legion, the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]], the [[Disabled American Veterans]], the [[American Ex-Prisoners of War]], the [[Retired Officers Association]], the 1st Infantry Division Association for the Uniformed Services (NAUS).{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=378}} He served for a term as first vice president of NAUS and was commander of the Northern Virginia Chapter of the American Ex-Prisoners of War.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=378}}

In 1983, he was appointed to the Editorial Advisory Board of the newly established [[Washington Times]] daily newspaper.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=379}}

===Later life===
The Juskalian family would eventually move to [[Centreville, Virginia|Centreville]], [[Virginia]] in 1989.<ref name=Bonnie2>{{cite news|last=Hobbs|first=Bonnie|title=Post Office Dedicated in Juskalian's Honor|url=http://connectionarchives.com/PDF/2011/052511/Centreview%20South.pdf|accessdate=31 March 2013|newspaper=CentreView|date=May 26 <U+2013> June 1, 2011|page=1/4}}</ref>

==Military service==

===World War II===
[[File:George Juskalian military.jpg|thumbnail|right|Juskalian during Reserve Officer training camp]]
====North African Campaign====

The 20,000 soldiers of the Division that would board the [[RMS Queen Mary]] were amongst the first American troops shipped out for WWII.<ref name=Patch /> The Division first landed near [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] and would proceed to a British army base near London to continue training.<ref name=Connection1 /> Juskalian, who became the assistant Plans and Operations officer on the regimental staff, went to [[Inveraray]], [[Scotland]] in order to conduct training for the [[North African Campaign]].<ref name=Connection1 />

On October 20, 1942 Juskalian and the convoy set sail through the Atlantic ocean in a westward direction to distract the enemy. On November 7, the convoy turned towards the east and went through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].

Juskalian, who was initially assigned as Lieutenant, took part in [[Operation Torch]] of the North Africa Campaign as part of the 26th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division.<ref>{{cite news|title=Society of 1st ID Mark Operation Torch|url=http://www3.ausa.org/webpub/DeptAUSANews.nsf/byid/CCRN-6CGM5J?OpenDocument&Print=1|accessdate=29 March 2013|newspaper=Association of the United States Army|date=January 1, 2002|quote=Standing in front of the 1st Infantry Division Monument after the commemoration ceremony ended, George Juskalian, an Operation Torch veteran with the 1st Infantry Division's 26th Regiment, told his wife and daughter why it was important that he attended.}}</ref> The Allies, who have organized three amphibious task forces, aimed to seize the key ports and airports of Morocco and Algeria while simultaneously targeting [[Casablanca]], [[Oran]] and [[Algiers]]. Juskalian was part of the task force that invaded through the port of [[Oran]] with Col. Roosevelt Jr. as brigadier general and assistant 1st Infantry Division commander.<ref name=Connection1 />

When landing in Oran on November 8, 1942, the American soldiers met resistance from the [[Afrika Korps]] under the command of [[Erwin Rommel]] as they began climbing Mount Jabal.<ref name=International /> The soldiers managed to break through the resistance and scale the mountain.<ref name=Connection1 /> After heavy fire from the British battleships, Oran would eventually fall under Allied control on November 10.

After the fall of Oran, Juskalian and the task force moved towards the east into [[Tunisia]] and reached the border of Algeria and Tunisia by January 15, 1943. Upon reaching the border, the task force met resistance from German and Italian troops who were already present there.<ref name=Connection1 />

Due to his efforts in the campaign, Juskalian distinguished himself in battle and earned the Silver Star.<ref name=Paramus />

====German Prisoner of War====

=====Capture=====
Juskalian was stationed in the regimental headquarters as the battle continued in the Makthar Valley.<ref name=Connection1 />
When attempting to save the life of a fellow soldier following heavy fighting, he was captured by German troops at [[Kasserine Pass]] in [[Tunisia]] on January 28.<ref name=Patch /><ref name=Paramus /><ref>{{cite news|title=N.E. Men Win Citations For Heroic Acts|accessdate=29 March 2013|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=August 5, 1943}}</ref><ref name=agbu>{{cite book|title=Armenian-American veterans of World War II|year=1951|publisher=Published and compiled by "Our Boys" Committee|page=99|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Lu2EAAAAIAAJ&q|author=[[Armenian General Benevolent Union]]|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref> Juskalian described his capture as follows:<ref name=Connection1 />

{{quotation|One of our intelligence officers had gone out to check on the situation, and word came back that he'd been wounded and was out there somewhere. So another officer and I went out in a Jeep and found him, but he was dead. Then we came under fire, so we couldn't drag him out of there.}}

After telling the driver to return to the command post, Juskalian checked up to see the conditions of the other U.S. soldiers.

<center>{{quotation|I thought they were all right because we hadn't heard anything from them, but they'd been overrun by the Germans.}}</center>

Having lost his glasses, Juskalian couldn't distinguish the soldiers that were approaching him from 50 feet away. The soldiers would turn out to be German and would subsequently take him in as a prisoner.

Juskalian would eventually express his discontent regarding the capture by saying, "I was irritated with myself for being so foolhardy, I shouldn't have been there."<ref name=Connection1 />

=====Oflag IX-A/Z in Rotenburg, Germany=====
Juskalian would eventually become POW for 27 months and be sent to various locations in Europe such as [[Italy]], [[Poland]] and [[Germany]].<ref name=Patch /><ref name=Reporter>{{cite news|last=Melkonian|first=Hovsep|title=Farewell to a patriot and an American hero|url=http://www.reporter.am/go/article/2010-07-27-farewell-to-a-patriot-and-an-american-hero|accessdate=29 March 2013|newspaper=The Armenian Reporter|date=July 27, 2010}}</ref> Juskalian, was promoted to Major two days after becoming a prisoner.<ref name=International /><ref name=agbu />

After being interrogated in [[Kairouan]], they were sent to [[Tunis]] and flown to [[Naples]]. The planes flew at a very low altitude as Juskalian described:<ref name=Connection1 />

{{quotation|They flew about 100 feet above the Mediterranean because they were afraid that, if they flew higher, the American fighter planes <U+2014> not knowing POWs were inside <U+2014> would see us and shoot us down.}}

The POWs were sent to the [[Oflag]] IX-A/Z British POW camp in [[Rotenburg an der Fulda]], where they remained until June 6, 1943 when they were transferred to the [[Oflag 64]] in [[Szubin]], [[Poland]].<ref name=Connection1 /><ref name=Connection2 />

======Escape tunnel======
The British POWs provided the Americans with necessary advice regarding the camp life and shared British Red Cross food rations and clothing.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=347}} The British, who were in the process of digging an escape tunnel, requested help from the Americans. Juskalian would later describe the operation:{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=347}}

{{quotation|I volunteered, although I have had claustrophobia ever since a boyhood friend shut me up in a wood bin for a prank. When I look back at it, I wonder how I did it. Some nights when I think about it, I break out in a cold sweat. Somehow, I was able to summon up the will to do it. The tunnel already was some 80 to 100 feet long. It extended underground beyond the barbed wire fence, but those in charge wanted to lengthen it so that the opening would come out below ground level on the steep side near the bank of the Fulda River. In that way when the tunnel was broken open, the escapees could not be seen by the guards in the towers.}}

The tunnel was about 3 feet high by 3 feet wide. Lighting in the tunnel was provided by makeshift candles; digging tools and shovels were improvised out of British biscuit cans with handles made from the wooden slats of their beds.<ref name=Connection1 /> The tins were also used to create a pipe which would funnel in fresh air with the assistance of a hand-cranked fan at the beginning of the tunnel.<ref name=Connection1 /> The sandbags were hauled back on a sled made of wooden slats with a tine base to make it slide easier over the earthen tunnel floor. Juskalian described the method used to dispose the sand:{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=347}}
{{quotation|The method used to conceal the sand was ingenious. The sand was poured into burlap bags made surreptitiously from Red Cross parcel wrappings then passed rapidly along a makeshift fire brigade line through the building and up into the attic. There it was dumped between the outer and inner walls where there was a wide space for insulation. Literally tons of sand could be disposed of there before the space would be filled.}}

Before the tunnel had been completed, the American POWs were transferred to [[Oflag 64]] in [[Szubin]], [[Poland]]. Juskalian estimated that if the tunnel had been dug for another 100 feet, it would reach its destination at the bank of the [[Fulda River]]. Two American POWs pretended to be sick in order to remain in the Rotenburg camp and continue working on the tunnel and ultimately escape. The two Americans, who eventually rejoined the rest of the American POWs in the Oflag 64, relayed the news that the tunnel was discovered by the German guards who had learned of its existence after planting a spy among the POWs.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=350}}

=====Oflag 64 in Szubin, Poland=====
[[File:Szubin.zak<U+0142>ad.poprawczy.JPG|thumbnail|The Oflag 64 where George Juskalian spent 19 1/2 months out of his 27 months as a POW.]]
Juskalian would eventually spend 19 1/2 of his entire 27 months as a POW in the [[Oflag 64]] in [[Szubin]], [[Poland]].<ref name=Connection2>{{cite news|title=Recollections of a War Veteran Part II|url=http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/news/2004/jun/16/recollections-of-a-war-veteran/|accessdate=31 March 2013|newspaper=The Virginia Connection|date=June 16, 2004}}</ref> The POWs would partake in various activities such as organizing a theater group, orchestra, library, athletics, language school and etc.<ref name=Connection2 /> Juskalian would become an editor to a monthly newspaper which was published with the assistance of a guard who owned a local printing shop.<ref name=Connection2 /> The newspaper featured "stories from home, cartoons, pictures of pin-up girls and girlfriends and articles about camp sports and activities."<ref name=Connection2 />

The American POWs had planned a party in observance of their one-year anniversary of being in the camp.<ref name=Paramus>{{cite journal|title=Military Hero Reminisces at St. Mary's/Ararat Foundation Lecture|journal=Armenian Reporter International|date=December 10, 1994|volume=28|issue=10|accessdate=29 March 2013|location=Paramus, NJ|issn=10741453}}</ref> During this time, they were informed of the [[Normandy landings]]. The German captors were convinced that the American POWs had planned the party because they knew in advance that the Allies were going to invade on that day.<ref name=Paramus />

The German Gestapo entered into the rooms of the American's in order to search for evidence or some sort of communicator device. The Gestapo was tempted to blow up the room in order to get rid of any sort of chance of communication. Juskalian gave one of his cigars that were gifted from his brother-in-law Hagop Chiknavorian, to the Gestapo who were soon "distracted and softened".{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=353}}

=====Oflag XIII B in Hammelburg, Germany=====
On January 21, 1945, the German troops moved the POWs westward into Germany in order to be clear of the Soviet advance from the east.<ref name=Bonnie>{{cite news|last=Hobbs|first=Bonnie|title=George Juskalian, in His Own Words|url=http://connectionarchives.com/PDF/2011/052511/Centreview%20South.pdf|accessdate=29 March 2013|newspaper=Centre View|date=May 26 <U+2013> June 1, 2011|page=4}}</ref> The Juskalian and other American POWs were transferred to [[Parchim]], northeast of [[Berlin]], on March 1, 1945. Eventually, the POWs traveled a 350 miles journey for 48 days from [[Parchim]] to the Oflag XIII B in [[Hammelburg]] with box cars which according to Juskalian, were "packed like sardines."<ref name=International /> During his time in Hammelburg, Juskalian met another Armenian POW, Captain Peter Mirakian of Philadelphia.<ref name=International /> Together, the two Armenian Americans found out that among the Soviet POWs, one Armenian had been captured.<ref name=Paramus /> In order to assist the Soviet Armenian captive, Mirakian and Juskalian snuck food to him from their limited rations.<ref name=Paramus />

The camp at [[Hammelburg]] had many American POWs from the [[Battle of the Bulge]] including [[George S. Patton]]'s son-in-law.<ref name=Bonnie /> In an attempt to save [[George S. Patton]]'s son-in-law, a military task force from the 4th Armored Division was sent out to liberate the camp.<ref name=Bonnie /> When the task force arrived, the German guards fled the camp. The task force did not have the number of vehicles needed to carry back the number of POWs in the camp. Consequently, both Peter and George walked through an opening in the prisoner compound fence and ran towards Frankfurt in the hopes of reaching the American lines. However, they were picked up by a German patrol and taken to [[Nuremberg]].<ref name=International /> Juskalian would later describe:<ref name=Connection1 />

{{quotation|They arrived the end of March, and the German guards fled, but there weren't enough trucks to take us all out there. German infantry soldiers were all around and my buddy Pete and I were recaptured, we were tired and depressed but thankful to be alive.}}

====Liberated as a POW====
During their time in Nuremberg, the Americans began their [[Battle of Nuremberg (1945)|bombardment]] of the city. Juskalian describes the moment in his own words:<ref name=Bonnie />

{{quotation|We were cheering, and our guards were getting irritated, but the bombs came down on us, too, and I was sure we were going to get it. About 30 of us were killed. I was thinking of my mother and how ironic it would be to be killed at the end of the war <U+2013> and by your own aircraft.}}

After surviving the bombardments in Nuremberg, the POWs were resettled in a camp near [[Munich]]. However, they were given the opportunity to return to Nuremberg as wounded soldiers to attain treatment.<ref name=Bonnie /> The POWs agreed to return to Nuremberg because it was closer to the American lines.

The American troops secured the city in April 17 and subsequently freed the POWs.<ref name=International /><ref name=Paramus /> Juskalian described the event:<ref name=Bonnie />

{{quotation|When the Germans tried to see if we were really wounded, the British erected a sign on the gate saying 'Plague,' and that kept them out, three or four days later, the 45th U.S. Infantry Division overran Nuremburg and we were liberated.}}

Juskalian would be eventually flown to [[Paris]], [[France]] where he would present himself at the military post and request financial assistance.<ref name=Connection1 /><ref name=Paramus /> However, he did not have official identification and was subsequently refused. An officer, who was already acquainted with George's older brother Richard (Dikran), who lived in Watertown, overheard him and recognized the last name of Juskalian. When asked if he was related to Richard, George responded by saying Richard was his older brother and upon hearing this, he was given all the provisions he needed.<ref name=Paramus />

Lt. Col. Juskalian's battalion was assigned to carry out a counterattack on a hill 300 feet high known as Old Baldy which would be eventually known as the [[Battle of Old Baldy]].{{sfn|Hermes|1966|p=395}} When the offensive came to a halt, Juskalian reorganized the forces under his command and sent both A and B companies under 1st Lt. Jack L. Conn on a second offensive.{{sfn|Hermes|1966|p=394}} The offensive proved successful as they regained a quarter of the hill.{{sfn|Hermes|1966|p=394}} On March 25 Juskalian ordered the C Company under 1st Lt. Robert C. Gutner to attack from the northeast. The offensive failed as the Chinese enemy forces halted the advance.{{sfn|Hermes|1966|p=394}} Many members of the C Company were trapped on the right flank of Old Baldy. Juskalian requested tank support to advance onto the Chinese bunkers and knock them down to free 30 to 40 troops of the C Company.{{sfn|Hermes|1966|p=394}}

On the night of March 26, Juskalian received orders from Colonel Kern for a withdrawal of his forces.{{sfn|Hermes|1966|p=395}}

Due to his efforts in the Korean War and a successful withdrawal of troops, he earned his second Silver Star for gallantry.<ref name=International /> The citation of the medal reads:<ref name=Connection2 />
{{quotation|The battalion encountered a mine field blocking the only route of approach, but Col. Juskalian <U+2014> with complete disregard for his personal safety <U+2014> placed himself at the front of his unit and led them through the field. Often exposing himself to the enemy, [he] moved from position to position. The gallantry [he] displayed is in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service.}}
