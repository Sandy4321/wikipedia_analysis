The monastery is located on the right bank of the [[Dnieper River]] on the edge of a bluff northeast of the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|Saint Sophia Cathedral]]. The site is located in the historic administrative Uppertown and overlooks the city's historical commercial and merchant quarter, the [[Podil]] neighbourhood.

Originally built in the [[Middle Ages]] by [[Sviatopolk II of Kiev|Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych]],<ref name="Kyiv">{{harvnb|Malikenaite|2003|p=147.}}</ref><ref name="EoU">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\S\A\SaintMichaelsGolden6DomedMonastery.htm|title=Saint Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery|accessdate=2006-08-18|last=Pavlovsky|first=Viktor|coauthors=A.

The exterior of the structure was rebuilt in the [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style in the 18th century while the interior remained in its original [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] style.<ref name="Hewryk-15">{{harvnb|Hewryk|1982|p=15.}}</ref> The original cathedral was demolished by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities in the 1930s, but was reconstructed and opened in 1999 following Ukrainian independence.

==History==
===11th to 19th centuries===
Some scholars do not believe that Prince [[Iziaslav I of Kiev|Iziaslav Yaroslavych]], whose Christian name was Demetrius, first built the Saint Demetrius's Monastery and Church in the Uppertown of Kiev near Saint Sophia Cathedral in the 1050s.<ref name="Kyiv"/><ref name="EoU"/> Half a century later, his son, [[Sviatopolk II of Kiev|Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych]], is recorded as commissioning a monastery church (1108<U+2013>1113) dedicated to his own patron saint, [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]]. One reason for building the church may have been Svyatopolk's recent victory over the nomadic [[Polovtsians]], as Michael the Archangel was considered a patron of warriors and victories.
[[Image:Michael of salonica.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The [[Mosaic]] of [[St. Demetrius]] was installed by Sviatopolk II in the monastery cathedral to glorify the patron saint of his father.]]
The monastery was regarded as a family cloister of Svyatopolk's family; it was there that members of Svyatopolk's family were buried. (This is in contrast to the [[Vydubychi Monastery]] patronized by his rival, [[Vladimir Monomakh]]). The cathedral [[dome]]s were probably the first in [[Kievan Rus]] to be gilded,<ref name="Brockhaus">{{cite web|url=http://gatchina3000.ru/brockhaus-and-efron-encyclopedic-dictionary/042/42113.htm|title=Zlatoverkhy Mikhailovsky monastyr|accessdate=2007-10-26|work=[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]|language=Russian}}</ref> a practice that became regular with the passage of time and acquired for the monastery the nickname of "golden-domed" or "golden-roofed", depending on the translation.

During the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol invasion]] in 1240, the monastery is believed to have been damaged seriously. The Mongols damaged the cathedral and removed its gold-plated domes.<ref>{{harvnb|Chobit|2005|p=147.}}</ref> The cloister subsequently fell into disrepair and there is no documentation of it for the following two and a half centuries. By 1496, the monastery had been revived and its name was changed from St. Demetrius' Monastery to St. Michael's after the cathedral church built by Sviatopolk II.{{#tag:ref|Historians are not certain which church survived the Tatar invasion, Saint Demetrius's or Saint Michael's.|group="nb"}} After numerous restorations and enlargements during the sixteenth century, it gradually became one of the most popular and wealthiest monasteries in Ukraine.<ref name="EoU"/><ref name="Brockhaus"/> In 1620, Iov Boretsky made it the residence of the renewed [[Metropolitan bishop#Orthodox|Orthodox metropolitan]] of Kiev, and in 1633, Isaya Kopynsky was named a supervisor of the monastery.{{#tag:ref|Both Iov Boretsky and Isaya Kopynsky were buried within the monastery.|group="nb"}}

The monastery enjoyed the patronage of [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|hetmans]] and other benefactors throughout the years. The chief magnet for pilgrims were the relics of [[Saint Barbara]], alleged to have been brought to Kiev from [[Constantinople]] in 1108 by Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych's wife and kept in a silver reliquary donated by Hetman [[Ivan Mazepa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zerkalo-nedeli.com/nn/show/612/54340/|title=Cathedral of outstanding deeds |accessdate=2006-09-17|last=Chervonozhka|first=Valentyna|date=September 2<U+2013>8, 2006|work=[[Zerkalo Nedeli]]|language=Russian/Ukrainian}}</ref><ref name="Little Kiev">{{harvnb|Makarov|2002|p=558.}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Starting from the late seventeenth century a song honoring St. Barbara was sung in the cathedral of the monastery on each Tuesday just before the liturgy ({{harvnb|Makarov|2002|p=558}}).|group="nb"}} Although most of the monastery grounds were [[Secularity|secularized]] in the late eighteenth century, as many as 240 [[monks]] resided there in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The monastery served as the residence of the bishop of [[Chernihiv|Chernigov]] after 1800. A precentor's school was located on the monastery grounds; many prominent composers, such as [[Kyrylo Stetsenko]] and [[Yakiv Yatsynevych]], either studied or taught at the school.

In 1870, about 100,000 pilgrims paid tribute to St. Barbara at St. Michael's Monastery.<ref name="Little Kiev"/> Before the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution in 1917]], rings manufactured and blessed at St. Michael's Monastery, known as St. Barbara's rings, were very popular among the citizens of Kiev. They usually served as good luck charms and, according to popular beliefs, occasionally protected against witchcraft but were also effective against serious illnesses and sudden death.<ref name="Little Kiev"/> These beliefs reference the facts that the Monastery was not affected by the [[bubonic plague|plague]] epidemics in 1710 and 1770 and [[cholera]] epidemics of the nineteenth century.

===Demolition of the cathedral and belltower===
[[File:Mykhalovsky Zlatoverkhy Cathedral 1930s.jpg|thumb|275px|View of the original St. Michael's Golden-Domed Cathedral prior to demolition.]]
[[File:Kyiv-Michael-monastery.jpg|thumb|275px|St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery in the early 1900s.]] 

During the first half of the 1930s, various [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] publications questioned the known historical facts regarding the age of the Cathedral. The publications stressed that the medieval building had undergone major reconstructions and that little of the original Byzantine-style cathedral was preserved. This wave of questioning led to the demolition of the monastery and its replacement with a new administrative centre for the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (previously located in the city of [[Kharkiv]]). Before its demolition (June 8<U+2013>July 9, 1934), the structure was carefully studied by T.M. Movchanivskyi and K. Honcharev from the recently [[Great Purge|purged and re-organized]] Institute of Material Culture of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine|Ukrainian Academy of Sciences]]. On the basis of their survey, the cathedral was declared to belong primarily to the [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style, rather than to the twelfth century as was previously thought, and thus did not merit preservation due to its lack of historical and artistic value. This conclusion backed up the Soviet authorities' plans to demolish the entire monastery. Local historians, archaeologists, and architects agreed to the monastery's demolition, although reluctantly. Only one professor, Mykola Makarenko, refused to sign the demolition act; he later died in a Soviet prison.<ref name="Kyiv"/>{{#tag:ref|There is a memorial plate dedicated to him, hanging on the monastery's walls.|group="nb"}}

On June 26, 1934, work began on the removal of the twelfth century Byzantine mosaics. It was conducted by the Mosaic Section of the Leningrad [[Imperial Academy of Fine Arts|Academy of Fine Arts]]. Specialists were forced to work in haste on account of the impending demolition and were thus unable to complete the entire project.<ref name="Hewryk-15"/> Despite the care and attention shown during the removal of the mosaics from the cathedral's walls, the relocated mosaics cannot be relied upon as being absolutely authentic.<ref name="Hewryk-16">{{harvnb|Hewryk|1982|p=16.}}</ref>

The remaining mosaics, covering an area of 45 square metres (485&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft), were partitioned between the [[State Hermitage Museum]], the [[Tretyakov Gallery]], and the [[State Russian Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/11/2004/hm11_2_141.html|title=The Transfer to the Ukraine of Fragments of Frescoes from Kiev<U+2019>s Mikhailovo-Zlatoverkh Monastery|accessdate=2006-08-06|work=The State Hermitage Museum}}</ref> The other remaining mosaics were installed on the second floor of the Saint Sophia Cathedral, where they were not on display for tourists. Those items that remained in Kiev were seized by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] during [[World War II]] and taken to [[Germany]]. After the war ended, they fell into [[United States|American]] hands and were later returned to Moscow.

During the spring of 1935, the golden domes of the monastery were pulled down. The cathedral's silver royal gates, Mazepa's reliquary (weighing two [[pood]]s of silver) and other valuables were sold abroad or simply destroyed.<ref name="Hewryk-16"/> Master Hryhoryi's five-tier [[iconostasis]] was removed (and later destroyed) from the cathedral as well. St. Barbara's relics were transferred to the [[Church of the Tithes]] and upon that church's demolition, to the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]] in 1961.

During the spring-summer period of 1936, the shell of the cathedral and belltower were blown up with [[dynamite]]. The monastery's Economic Gate ({{lang|uk-Latn|''Ekonomichna Brama''}}) and the monastic walls were also destroyed. After the demolition, a thorough search for valuables was carried out by the [[NKVD]] on the site.<ref name="Hewryk-16"/>

The only building completed on the former monastery grounds before World War II currently houses the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ukraine)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. The construction of the second building ("the capital center"), planned to be built on the site where the Cathedral had once stood, was delayed in the spring of 1938 as the authorities were not satisfied with the submitted design. This building failed to materialize. Some time after demolition, the site where the former cathedral used to be located was transformed into a sport complex, including [[tennis]] and [[volleyball]] courts. The Refectory ({{lang|uk-Latn|''Trapezna''}}) of [[St. John the Divine]] was used for changing rooms.

===Preservation and reconstruction===
In August 1963, the preserved refectory of the demolished monastery without its Baroque cupola was designated a monument of architecture of the Ukrainian SSR. In 1973, the [[Kiev City Council]] established several "archaeological preservation zones" within the city; these included the territory surrounding the monastery. However, the vacant site of the demolished cathedral was excluded from the proposed Historic-Archaeological Park-Museum, ''The Ancient Kiev'', developed by architect A. M. Miletskyi and consultants M. V. Kholostenko and P. P. Tolochko.

During the 1970s, Ukrainian architects I. Melnyk, A. Zayika, V. Korol, and engineer A. Kolyakov worked out a plan of reconstruction of the St. Michael's Monastery. However, these plans were only considered after the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985<U+2013>1991)|fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.<ref>{{harvnb|Chobit|2005|p=24.}}</ref>

[[File:St. Michael's Golden-Domed mosaic.jpg|thumb|250px|The Eucharist mosaic is installed on the second floor of the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|Saint Sophia Cathedral]].]]

After [[Ukraine]] regained independence in 1991, the demolition of the monastery was deemed a crime and voices started to be heard calling for the monastery's full-scale reconstruction as an important part of the cultural heritage of the Ukrainian people. These plans were approved and carried out in 1997<U+2013>1998, whereupon the cathedral and belltower were transferred to the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate|Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchate]]. Yuriy Ivakin, the chief archaeologist for the site, said that more than 260 valuable ancient artifacts were recovered during excavations of the site before reconstruction. In addition, a portion of the ancient cathedral, still intact, was uncovered; this today makes up a part of the current cathedral's crypt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/1998/489803.shtml|title=Historic St. Michael's Golden-Domed Sobor is rebuilt|accessdate=2006-08-29|last=Woronowycz|first=Roman |authorlink= |coauthors=|date=November 29, 1998|work=[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]|publisher=Kyiv Press Bureau|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060427214210/http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/1998/489803.shtml |archivedate = April 27, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref> 

With support of the [[Kiev City Council|Kiev city authorities]], architect-restorer Y. Lositskiy and others restored the western part of the stone walls. The belltower was restored next and became an observation platform. Instead of the original chiming clock, a new electronic one with hands and a set of chimes (a total of 40)<ref>{{harvnb|Chobit|2005|p=26.}}</ref> was installed from which today the melodies of famous Ukrainian composers can be heard.{{#tag:ref|The bells chime every hour and play 23 different melodies ({{harvnb|Chobit|2005|p=26}}).|group="nb"}} The Cathedral was reconstructed last and decorated with a set of wooden baroque icons, copies of former mosaics and frescoes, and new works of art by Ukrainian artists.<ref name="Kyiv"/>

The newly rebuilt St. Michael's Golden-Domed Cathedral was officially opened on May 30, 1999. However, interior decorations, mosaics, and frescoes were not completed until May 28, 2000. The side chapels were consecrated to [[Saint Barbara|SS. Barbara]] and [[Catherine of Alexandria|Catherine]] in 2001. During the following four years, 18 out of 29 mosaics and other [[work of art|objets d'art]] from the original cathedral were returned from Moscow after years of tedious discussion between Ukrainian and Russian authorities.<ref name="EoU"/> However, by the end of 2006, the remaining frescoes of the monastery are going to be transferred from the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] to Kiev.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.korrespondent.net/main/172090/|title=The frescoes of the Michael's Monastery are going to be returned to Ukraine|accessdate=2006-12-02|work=[[Korrespondent]]|language=Russian}}</ref> They are placed in a special preserve that is owned by the municipality rather than the church body.

The [[religious architecture]] of St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery incorporates elements that have evolved from styles prevalent during [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] periods. The St. Michael's Golden-Domed Cathedral ({{lang-uk|<U+041C><U+0438><U+0445><U+0430><U+0439><U+043B><U+0456><U+0432><U+0441><U+044C><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0417><U+043E><U+043B><U+043E><U+0442><U+043E><U+0432><U+0435><U+0440><U+0445><U+0438><U+0439> C<U+043E><U+0431><U+043E><U+0440>}}) is the monastery's main church, built in 1108<U+2013>1113 at the behest of [[Sviatopolk II of Kiev|Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych]]. The cathedral was the largest of three churches of St. Demetrius Monastery.

The ancient cathedral was modeled on the Assumption Cathedral of the [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra|Kiev Monastery of the Caves]]. It used the [[Greek cross]] plan prevalent during the time of the [[Kievan Rus]], six pillars, and three apses. A miniature church, likely a [[baptistery]], adjoined the cathedral from the south. There was also a tower with a staircase leading to the choir loft; it was incorporated into the northern part of the [[narthex]] rather than protruding from the main block as was common at the time. It is likely that the cathedral had a single dome, although two smaller domes might have topped the tower and baptistery. The interior decoration was lavish as its high-quality shimmering mosaics, probably the finest in Kievan Rus, still testify.<ref>{{harvnb|Makarov|2002|p=558.}}</ref>

When the medieval churches of Kiev were rebuilt in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries in the [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style, the cathedral was enlarged and renovated dramatically. By 1746, it had acquired a new baroque exterior, while maintaining its original Byzantine interior. Six domes were added to the original single dome, but the added pressure on the walls was counteracted by the construction of [[buttress]]es.<ref name="Kyiv"/> The remaining medieval walls, characterised by alternative layers of limestone and flat brick, were covered with [[stucco]]. [[Ivan Hryhorovych-Barskyi]] was responsible for window surrounds and stucco ornamentation.

Inside the church, an intricate five-tier [[iconostasis|icon screen]] funded by [[Hetman]] [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]] and executed by Hryhoryi Petriv from [[Chernihiv|Chernigov]] was installed in 1718. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, almost all of the original Byzantine mosaics and frescoes on the interior walls were painted over. Some restoration work on the mosaics and frescoes that remained unpainted was carried out towards the end of the nineteenth century. However, there were no major and serious investigations of the walls done, so it is possible that medieval frescoes or mosaics were preserved under the newer coats of plaster.

The refectory of the monastery is a rectangular brick building which contains a dining hall for the brethren as well as several kitchens and pantries. The church of [[St. John the Divine]] adjoins it from the east. The outside is segmented by [[pilaster]]s and displays window surrounds reminiscent of traditional [[Russian architecture|Muscovite architecture]]. The refectory was erected in 1713 in place of the wooden one. Its interior was overhauled in 1827 and 1837 and restoration work was undertaken in 1976<U+2013>1981. The monastery belltower was built in three tiers in 1716<U+2013>1720, and is surmounted by a pear-shaped dome.
