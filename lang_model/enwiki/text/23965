'''Karunakara Thondaiman''' alias '''''Karunakara Pallavaraiyan''''' alias '''''Karunakara-Kon''''' was the Pallavan king, the prime minister and the undaunted general of [[Kulottunga Chola I|Ko Rajakesarivarman Abaya Kulottunga Chola]]<ref>''The Imperial and asiatic quarterly review and oriental and colonial record'', page 328.</ref><ref>''History of the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi, 610-1210 A.D.'', page 446.</ref>.

After the period of [[Kulottunga Chola I]], he will continue to serve as the prime minister of the former's son [[Vikrama Chola]] as well<ref>''The Cholas: mathematics reconstructs the chronology'', page 171</ref>

==Personal life==

He was born as a Pallavan prince and becomes the prime minister and a vassal of [[Kulottunga Chola I]]. He is married to one Alagiyamanavalini. Another notable member of his family is his brother, Pallavaraiyan who also accompanies him to Kalinga. His brother is the flag bearer and it is he who hoists the flag at the pillar of victory in Kalinga<ref>Kallidaikurichi Aiyah Nilakanta Sastri: ''The C<U+014D><U+1E37>as'', page 334.</ref>.

==Lankan War==

The [[Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan]] vassal of the Chola kingdom during the reign of [[Kulottunga Chola I]] will betray the [[Chola]] sovereign and will pledge allegiance to the Sinhala king in order to become the sole ruler of the Chola province in [[Ceylon]]. When this is brought to the attention of [[Kulottunga Chola I]], the furious king will term the traitor - ''Siva Drohin'' figuratively meaning ''traitor of the (Saivite) Cholas''<ref>''The Ty<U+0101>gar<U+0101>ja cult in Tamiln<U+0101><U+1E0D>u: a study in conflict and accommodation'', page 322: '''The close link between Saivism and politics can be seen when the Ceylonese general is described as a Sivadrohin'''</ref>. Karunakara Thondaiman will take this opportunity to show his loyalty and go on to plunder Lanka. The Karunakara Pillaiyar temple in the Jaffna peninsula was built after him. The Thondaiman aaru (river) in [[Ceylon]] was also named after him<ref>''Tamil culture, Volume 4'', page 242.</ref><ref>''The Tamils in early Ceylon'', page 116.</ref>.

==Kalinga War==

The Kalinga kingdom was then ruled by the Chalukya king Anantavarman Chodaganga. When [[Kulottunga Chola I]] holds his court at [[Kanchi]], it is brought to his attention that Anantavarman has failed to pay tribute on two occasions to the Chola sovereign. This is taken as a sign of slight for not recognizing the Chola superiority and the King would dispatch Karunakara Thondaiman to bring the Chalukya to his knees. [[Kulottunga Chola I]] stays back at [[Kanchi]], directing the war while ordering Karunakara Thondaiman to capture Anantavarman alive. [[Vikrama Chola]], a young prince then, will tag along to learn the ropes of war as Karunakara Thondaiman will go on to create history in the process<ref>''A comprehensive history of India, Volume 4, Part 1'', By Kallidaikurichi Aiyah Nilakanta Sastri, Indian History Congress.</ref>.

According to tradition and the Vaishnava point of view, the god on the hill ([[Tirupati]]) had parted with his conch and the [[Sudarshana chakra]] to Karun<U+0101>kara Perum<U+0101>l, the conqueror of [[Kalinga]] and the true hero of the [[Kalingathuparani]]<ref name="Ancient India: collected essays on the literary and political history of Southern India, page 215">''Ancient India: collected essays on the literary and political history of Southern India, page 215''</ref>. Karunakara Thondaiman will defeat the Kalinga armies of Anantavarman and plant a pillar of victory in Kalinga (modern day [[Orissa]]). Anantavarman will flee never to be found again<ref>''Sri Varadarajaswami Temple, Kanchi: A Study of Its History, Art and Architecture'', page 13.</ref>. The war is described by [[Jayamkondar]], the poet-laureate of [[Kulottunga Chola I]] in graphic detail in the poem ''[[Kalinkkattuparani]]''. Here is an excerpt:

Vandaiyar, now identified with Vandalur is an area in [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]]<ref>''Ancient India: collected essays on the literary and political history of Southern India'', page 146</ref>
