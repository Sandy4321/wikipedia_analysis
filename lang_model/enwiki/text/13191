==Musical career==
===2006<U+2013>11: Formation and career beginnings===
Jordan and Harley both attended [[Brit School]] where Jordan studied Media and Harley studied Theatre. Jordan was in the process of making his mixtape ''Minor Breaches of Discipline'' where he rapped over samples of some of their favourite artists ([[Gorillaz]], [[Lily Allen]], [[Arctic Monkeys]]) and asked Harley to sing over some of the tracks. Realizing how well their styles fitted together, they formed Rizzle Kicks in 2008.<ref name="rizzlekicks1">{{cite web|author=Rizzle Kicks |url=http://www.rizzlekicks.com/about |title=Biography www.rizzlekicks.com/ |publisher=Rizzle Kicks |date= |accessdate=2011-10-13}}</ref> The name stems from 'Green [[Rizla]]', an early nickname given to Stephens by a [[association football|football]] teammate after a crew of the same name from the school that he attended at the time. That nickname evolved into 'Rizzle' and the duo decided on the suffix 'kicks' due to their shared love of football.<ref>{{cite web|author=Music |url=http://www.pyromag.com/music/13551/rizzle-kicks-interview/ |title=Rizzle Kicks Interview |publisher=PyroMag.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref>

As a newly formed duo, they hustled for beats from local producers, honing their sound, and created several bedroom demos, three of which ended up on their debut album. They soon started to garner a presence online; blogging on their website "Your Daily Kicks" as well as posting lo-fi music videos to their [[YouTube]] channel.<ref>{{cite news|author=Rizzle Kicks |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/youtube-and-the-modern-road-to-stardom-2373499.html |title=YouTube and the modern road to stardom/ |publisher=Independent |date= |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref> The videos were co-directed by the band and made by Toby Lockerbie, a wedding photographer they met at a party. A video was made for a demo of "[[Down with the Trumpets]]" in the Summer of 2010, closely followed by the video for "Miss Cigarette". During that time, they finished college and Harley went on to work as an assistant drama teacher, whilst Jordan was flipping burgers at the Corals Greyhound Stadium in [[Hove]].

Their YouTube videos caught the attention of several record labels and in November 2010, they signed to [[Island Records]], part of [[Universal Music]]. They continued work on their debut album and worked with several producers including [[Ant Whiting]], [[Norman Cook]], The Rural, Futurecut and Craigie Dodds.''
