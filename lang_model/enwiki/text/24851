==Structure==

None of the property remains.  Architectural fragments have been built into farm buildings.  The left hand part of a gun loop is built into the east-north-east gable of the farmhouse, while a carved fragment of stone is built into the north wall of the farm outbuilding to its east.<ref name="Stravaiging around Scotland">{{cite web|url=http://www.stravaiging.com/history/castle/dumbreck-castle|title=Dumbreck Castle|accessdate=2015-01-10}}</ref>
