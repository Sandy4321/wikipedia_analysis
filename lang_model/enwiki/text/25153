'''''Burger's Daughter''''' is an [[historical novel|historical]] and [[Political fiction|political novel]] by the South African [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]-winner [[Nadine Gordimer]], first published in the United Kingdom in 1979 by [[Jonathan Cape]]. The book was expected to be banned in South Africa, and a month after publication in London the import and sale of the book in South Africa was prohibited by the Publications Control Board. Three months later, the Publications Appeal Board overturned the banning and the restrictions were lifted.

''Burger's Daughter'' details a group of white [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-apartheid]] activists in South Africa seeking to overthrow the South African government. It is set in the mid-1970s, and follows the life of Rosa, the title character, as she comes to terms with her father Lionel Burger's legacy as an activist in the [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP). The perspective shifts between Rosa's [[internal monologue]] (often directed towards her father or her lover Conrad), and the omniscient narrator. The novel is rooted in the history of the anti-apartheid struggle and references to actual events and people from that period, including [[Nelson Mandela]] and the 1976 [[Soweto uprising]].

Gordimer herself was involved in South African struggle politics, and she knew many of the activists, including [[Bram Fischer]], Mandela's treason trial defence lawyer. She modelled the Burger family in the novel loosely on Fischer's family, and described ''Burger's Daughter'' as "a coded homage" to Fischer.<ref name=Wastberg/> While banned in South Africa, a copy of the book was smuggled into Mandela's prison cell on [[Robben Island]], and he reported that he "thought well of it".<ref name=NovelRights/>

The novel was generally well-received by critics. A reviewer for ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that ''Burger's Daughter'' is Gordimer's "most political and most moving novel",<ref name=Sampson/> and a review in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' described the style of writing as "elegant", "fastidious" and belonging to a "cultivated upper class".<ref name="O'Brien"/> A critic in ''[[The Hudson Review]]'' had mixed feelings about the book, saying that it "gives scarcely any pleasure in the reading but which one is pleased to have read nonetheless".<ref name="jstor3850722"/> ''Burger's Daughter'' won the [[Central News Agency Literary Award]] in 1980.

==Plot summary==
The novel begins in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1974 during [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]]. Rosa is 26, and her father, Lionel Burger, a white [[Afrikaner]] [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-apartheid]] activist, has died in prison after serving three years of a life sentence for treason. When she was 14, her mother, Cathy Burger, also died in prison. Rosa had grown up in a family that actively supported the overthrow of the apartheid government, and the house they lived in opened its doors to anyone supporting the struggle, regardless of colour. Living with them was "Baasie" (little boss),<ref name=Turgeon/> a black boy Rosa's age the Burgers had "adopted" when his father had died in prison. Baasie and Rosa grew up as brother and sister. Rosa's parents were members of the outlawed [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP), and had been arrested several times when she was a child. When Rosa was nine, she was sent to stay with her father's family; Baasie was sent elsewhere, and she lost contact with him.

With the Burger's house now empty, Rosa sells it and moves in with Conrad, a student who had befriended her during her father's trial. Conrad questions her about her role in the Burger family and asks why she always did what she was told. Later Rosa leaves Conrad and moves into a [[apartment|flat]] on her own and works as a [[Physical therapy|physiotherapist]]. In 1975 Rosa attends a party of a friend in [[Soweto]], and it is there that she hears a black university student dismissing all whites' help as irrelevant, saying that whites cannot know what blacks want, and that blacks will liberate themselves. Despite being labelled a Communist and under surveillance by the authorities, Rosa manages to get a passport, and flies to [[Nice]] in France to spend several months with Katya, her father's first wife. There she meets Bernard Chabalier, a visiting academic from Paris. They become lovers and he persuades her to return with him to Paris.

Before joining Bernard in Paris, Rosa stays in a flat in London for several weeks. Now that she has no intention of honouring the agreement of her passport, which was to return to South Africa within a year, she openly introduces herself as Burger's daughter. This attracts the attention of the media and she attends several political events. At one such event, Rosa sees Baasie, but when she tries to talk to him, he starts criticising her for not knowing his real name (Zwelinzima Vulindlela). He says that there is nothing special about her father having died in prison as many black fathers have also died there, and adds that he does not need her help. Rosa is devastated by her childhood friend's hurtful remarks, and overcome with guilt, she abandons her plans of going into exile in France and returns to South Africa.

Back home she resumes her job as a physiotherapist in Soweto. Then in [[1976 in South Africa#June|June 1976]] Soweto school children start protesting about their inferior education and being taught in [[Afrikaans]]. They go on a rampage, which includes killing white welfare workers. The police brutally put down the [[Soweto uprising|uprising]], resulting in hundreds of deaths. In October 1977, many organisations and people critical of the white government are banned, and in November 1977 Rosa Burger is detained. Her lawyer, who also represented her father, expects charges to be brought against her of furthering the aims of the banned SACP and [[African National Congress]] (ANC), and of aiding and abetting the students' revolt.

==Background==
In a 1980 interview, Gordimer stated that she was fascinated by the role of "white hard-core Leftists" in South Africa, and that she had long envisaged the idea for ''Burger's Daughter''.{{sfn|Gardner|1990|p=161}} Inspired by the work of [[Bram Fischer]], she published an essay about him in 1961 entitled "Why Did Bram Fischer Choose to Go to Jail?"{{sfn|Marsh-Lockett|2012|p=193}} Fischer was the Afrikaner [[advocate]] and Communist who was [[Nelson Mandela]]'s defence lawyer during his 1956 [[1956 Treason Trial|Treason Trial]] and his 1965 [[Rivonia Trial]].<ref name=Wits-Law-School/> As a friend of many of the activist families, including Fischer's, Gordimer knew these families' children were "politically groomed" for the struggle, and were taught that "the struggle came first" and they came second.<ref name=achievement-int1/> She modelled the Burger family in the novel loosely on Fischer's family,<ref name=Steele/> and Lionel Burger on Fischer himself.{{sfn|De Lange|1997|p=82}}{{sfn|Yelin|1991|p=221}} While Gordimer never said the book was about Fischer, she did describe it as "a coded homage" to him.<ref name=Wastberg/> Fischer's daughter said later that she "recognised their lives" in the book.<ref name=Wastberg/>

Gordimer's homage to Fischer extends to using excerpts from his writings and public statements in the book.{{sfn|De Lange|1997|p=83}} Lionel Burger's treason trial speech from the dock{{sfn|Gordimer|1979|pp=24<U+2013>27}} is taken from the speech Fischer gave at his own trial in 1966.{{sfn|Yelin|1991|p=221}}{{sfn|De Lange|1997|p=83}} Fischer was the leader of the banned SACP who was given a life sentence for furthering the aims of communism and conspiracy to overthrow the government. Quoting people like Fischer was not permitted in South Africa.{{sfn|De Lange|1997|p=83}} All Gordimer's quotes from banned sources in ''Burger's Daughter'' are unattributed, and also include writings of [[Joe Slovo]], a member of the SACP and the outlawed ANC, and a pamphlet{{sfn|Gordimer|1979|pp=346<U+2013>347}} written and distributed by the Soweto Students Representative Council during the Soweto uprising.{{sfn|Yelin|1991|p=221}}

Gordimer herself became involved in South African struggle politics after the arrest of a friend, Bettie du Toit, in 1960 for trade unionist activities and being a member of the SACP.<ref name=Wastberg/><ref name=achievement-int5/> Just as Rosa Burger in the novel visits family in prison, so Gordimer visited her friend.<ref name=achievement-int1/> Later in 1986, Gordimer gave evidence at the [[Delmas Treason Trial]] in support of 22 ANC members accused of treason. She was a member of the ANC while it was still an illegal organization in South Africa, and hid several ANC leaders in her own home to help them evade arrest by the security forces.<ref name=Wastberg/><ref name=Steele/>

The inspiration for ''Burger's Daughter'' came when Gordimer was waiting to visit a political detainee in prison, and amongst the other visitors she saw a school girl, the daughter of an activist she knew. She wondered what this child was thinking and what family obligations were making her stand there.<ref name=Turgeon/> The novel opens with the same scene: a 14-year-old Rosa Burger waiting outside a prison to visit her detained mother.{{sfn|Gordimer|1979|p=9}} Gordimer said that children like these, whose activist parents were frequently arrested and detained, periodically had to manage entire households on their own, and it must have changed their lives completely. She stated that it was these children who encouraged her to write the book.{{sfn|Cooke|2003|p=84}}

''Burger's Daughter'' took Gordimer four years to write, starting from a handful of what she called "very scrappy notes", "half sentences" and "little snatches of dialogue".<ref name=Paris-Review-int/> Once she got going, she said, the writing became an "organic process".<ref name=Paris-Review-int/> The Soweto riots in 1976 happened while she was working on the book, and she changed the plot to incorporate the uprising. Gordimer explained that "Rosa would have come back to South Africa; that was inevitable", but "[t]here would have been a different ending".{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=182}} During those four years she also wrote two non-fiction articles to take breaks from working on the novel.<ref name=Paris-Review-int/>

Gordimer remarked that, more than just a story about white communists in South Africa, ''Burger's Daughter'' is about "commitment" and what she as a writer does to "make sense of life".<ref name=Paris-Review-int/> After Mandela and Fischer were sentenced in the mid-1960s, Gordimer considered going into exile, but she changed her mind and later recalled "I wouldn't be accepted as I was here, even in the worst times and even though I'm white".<ref name=Steele/> Just as Rosa struggles to find her place as a white in the anti-apartheid liberation movement, so did Gordimer. In an interview in 1980, she said that "when we have got beyond the apartheid situation<U+2014>there's a tremendous problem for whites, unless whites are allowed in by blacks, and unless we can make out a case for our being accepted and we can forge a common culture together, whites are going to be marginal".{{sfn|Gardner|1990|p=168}}

==Publication and banning==
Gordimer knew that ''Burger's Daughter'' would be banned in South Africa.<ref name=achievement-int1/> After the book was published in London by [[Jonathan Cape]] in June 1979,<ref name=Mitgang/> copies were dispatched to South Africa, and on 5 July 1979 the book ''was'' banned from import and sale in South Africa.{{sfn|Karolides|2006|p=72}} The reasons given by the Publications Control Board included "propagating Communist opinions", "creating a psychosis of revolution and rebellion", and "making several unbridled attacks against the authority entrusted with the maintenance of law and order and the safety of the state".{{sfn|Gardner|1990|p=161}}

[[File:NadineGordimer Burger'sDaughter inscribed.jpg|thumb|left|Title page inscription by Nadine Gordimer to Nelson Mandela (Madiba{{#tag:ref|In South Africa, as a sign of respect and affection, [[Nelson Mandela]] is referred to by many as the "Father of the Nation", and is often called "Madiba", after his [[Xhosa clan names|Xhosa clan name]].<ref name=BBC/>|group="nb"}}) in a copy of ''Burger's Daughter''|alt=Title page of Burger's Daughter with a hand-written inscription by Nadine Gordimer addressed to Madiba (Nelson Mandela)]]
In October 1979 the Publications Appeal Board, on the recommendation of a panel of literary experts and a state security specialist, overruled the banning of ''Burger's Daughter''.{{sfn|Karolides|2006|p=72}} The state security specialist reported the book posed no threat to the security of South Africa, and the literary experts had accused the censorship board "of bias, prejudice, and literary incompetence", and that "[i]t has not read accurately, it has severely distorted by quoting extensively out of context, it has not considered the work as a literary work deserves to be considered, and it has directly, and by implication, smeared the authoress [sic]."{{sfn|Karolides|2006|p=72}} Notwithstanding the unbanning, the chairman of the Appeal Board told a press reporter, "Don't buy [the book]<U+2014>it is not worth buying. Very badly written ... This is also why we eventually passed it."<ref name="jstor3818653"/> The Appeal Board described the book as "one-sided" in its attack on whites and the South African Government, and concluded, "As a result ... the effect of the book will be counterproductive rather than subversive."<ref name="jstor3818653"/>

Gordimer's response to the novel's unbanning was, "I was indifferent to the opinions of the original censorship committee who neither read nor understood the book properly in the first place, and to those of the committee of literary experts who made this discovery, since both are part of the censorship system."<ref name="jstor3818653"/> She attributed the unbanning to her international stature and the "serious attention" the book had received abroad.<ref name=Paris-Review-int/> A number of prominent authors and literary organisations had protested the banning, including [[Iris Murdoch]], [[Heinrich B<U+00F6>ll]], [[Paul Theroux]], [[John Fowles]], [[Frank Kermode]], [[Association of American Publishers|The Association of American Publishers]] and [[PEN International|International PEN]].<ref name="jstor3818653"/> Gordimer objected to the unbanning of the book because she felt the government was trying placate her with "special treatment", and said that the same thing would not have happened had she been black.<ref name=Kirsch/> But she did describe the action as "something of a precedent for other writers" because in the book she had published a copy of an actual pamphlet written and distributed by students in the 1976 Soweto uprising,{{sfn|Gordimer|1979|pp=346<U+2013>347}} which the authorities had banned. She said that similar "transgressions" in the future would be difficult for the censors to clamp down on.<ref name=Paris-Review-int/>

[[File:Nelson Mandela.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Nelson Mandela in 1993|alt=A head-and-shoulders photograph of an elderly man]]
While ''Burger's Daughter'' was still banned in South Africa, a copy was smuggled into Nelson Mandela's prison cell on [[Robben Island]], and later a message was sent out saying that he had "thought well of it".<ref name=NovelRights/> Gordimer said, "That means more to me than any other opinion it could have gained."<ref name=NovelRights/> Mandela also requested a meeting with her, and she applied several times to visit him on the Island, but was declined each time. She was, however, at the prison gates waiting for him when he was released in 1990,<ref name=achievement-int5/> and she was amongst the first he wanted to talk to.<ref name=achievement-bio/> In 2007 Gordimer sent Mandela an inscribed copy of ''Burger's Daughter'' to "replace the 'imprisoned' copy", and in it she thanked him for his opinion of the book, and for "untiringly leading the struggle".<ref name=MandelaArchives/>

===''What Happened to Burger's Daughter''===
{{Main|What Happened to Burger's Daughter or How South African Censorship Works}}
To voice her disapproval of the banning and unbanning of the book, Gordimer published ''[[What Happened to Burger's Daughter or How South African Censorship Works]]'', a book of essays written by her and others.{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=177}} It was published in Johannesburg in 1980 by Taurus, a small [[Underground press|underground]] publishing house established in the late-1970s to print anti-apartheid literature and other material South African publishers would avoid for fear of censorship. The books were generally distributed privately or sent to bookshops to be given to customers free to avoid attracting the attention of the South African authorities.<ref name=achievement-int1/><ref name="jstor3818653"/>

''What Happened to Burger's Daughter'' has two essays by Gordimer and one by [[University of the Witwatersrand]] law professor [[John Dugard]]. Gordimer's essays document the publication history and fate of ''Burger's Daughter'', and respond to the Publications Control Board's reasons for banning the book. Dugard's essay examines censorship in South Africa within the country's legal framework. Also included in the book is the Director of Publications's communiqu<U+00E9> stating its reasons for banning the book, and the reasons for lifting the ban three months later by the Publications Appeal Board.<ref name="jstor40135909"/>

}}
The [[narrative mode]] of ''Burger's Daughter'' alternates between Rosa Burger's [[internal monologue]]s and the anonymous narrator, whom Gordimer calls "Rosa's conscious analysis, her reasoning approach to her life and to this country, and ... my exploration as a writer of what she doesn't know even when she ''thinks'' she's finding out".{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=178}} Abdul R. JanMohamed, professor of English and American Literature at [[Emory University]],<ref name=EmoryU/> calls this change of perspective a "stylistic bifurcation",{{sfn|JanMohamed|1983|p=128}} which allows the reader to see Rosa from different points of view, rendering her a complex character who is full of contradictions.<ref name="jstor3831565"/> The two narratives, the subjective and the objective viewpoints, complement each other. JanMohamed explains that while the objective, [[third-person narrative]] is factual and neutral, the subjective [[first-person narrative]], Rosa's voice, is intense and personal. Rosa's monologues are directed towards Conrad, her lover, in the first part of the story, her father's former wife, Katya, while Rosa is in France, and her father after she returns to South Africa. Because her imagined audience is always sympathetic and never questions her, Rosa's confessions are honest and open.{{sfn|JanMohamed|1983|pp=127<U+2013>128}}

According to academic Robin Ellen Visel, Rosa is a complicated person, with roles thrust on her by her parents, which suppresses her own goals and desires. Gordimer explains how she constructed the book's narrative structure to convey this struggle and explain Rosa: "[T]he idea came to me of Rosa questioning herself as others see her and whether what they see is what she really is. And that developed into another stylistic question<U+2014>if you're going to tell the book in the first person, to whom are you talking?"{{sfn|Gardner|1990|pp=170<U+2013>171}} This led to Gordimer creating Conrad and Katya for Rosa to use as [[sounding board]]s to question and explain herself.{{sfn|Visel|1987|p=182}}

Irene Kacandes, professor of German Studies and Comparative Literature at [[Dartmouth College]], calls Rosa's internal monologues [[apostrophe (figure of speech)|apostrophe]]s, or "intrapsychic witnessing",{{sfn|Kacandes|2001|p=103}} in which "a character witnesses to the self about the character's own experience".{{sfn|Kacandes|2001|p=97}} Kacandes points out that Rosa believes she would not be able to internalise anything if she knew someone was listening. In an apostrophe addressed to Conrad, Rosa remarks, "If you knew I was talking to you I wouldn't be able to talk".{{sfn|Gordimer|1979|p=16}} But because Rosa is not vocalising her monologues, no one can hear her, and she is able to proceed with her self-analysis unhindered. Kacandes says "Rosa imagines an interlocutor and then occupies that place herself."{{sfn|Kacandes|2001|p=104}}

Gordimer uses [[Non-English usage of quotation marks#Quotation dash|quotation dashes]] to punctuate her dialogue in ''Burger's Daughter'' instead of traditional [[quotation mark]]s. She told an interviewer in 1980 that readers have complained that this sometimes makes it difficult to identify the speaker, but she added "I don't care. I simply cannot stand he-said/she-said anymore. And if I can't make readers ''know'' who<U+2019>s speaking from the tone of voice, the turns of phrase, well, then I've failed."<ref name=Paris-Review-int/>

Visel says that the use of dashes for dialogue "conveys the sense of conversation set within the flow of memory" and "is congruent with the sense of Rosa speaking essentially to herself, speakers and listeners in her conversations being dead or unreachable."{{sfn|Visel|1987|pp=180<U+2013>181}}

==Genre==
Some commentators have classified ''Burger's Daughter'' as an [[historical novel|historical]] and [[Political fiction|political novel]]. In their book ''Socialist Cultures East and West: A Post-Cold War Reassessment'', M. Keith Booker and Dubravka Juraga call Gordimer's work one of the "representative examples of African historical novels", saying that it is an "intense engagement with the history of apartheid in South Africa".{{sfn|Juraga|Booker|2002|p=18}} Academic Robert Boyers calls it "one of the best political novels of our period",{{sfn|Boyers|1984|p=65}} and an historical novel because of its "retrospective homage to generations past".{{sfn|Boyers|1984|p=67}} Gordimer herself describes ''Burger's Daughter'' as "an historical critique",{{sfn|Gray|1990|p=182}} and a political novel, which she defines as a work that "explicates the effects of politics on human lives and, unlike a political tract, does not propagate an ideology".{{sfn|Yelin|1998|pp=126<U+2013>127}}

Visel calls the novel "fictionalised history" that shadows the history of anti-apartheid activism in South Africa, from 1946 and the [[1946 African Mine Workers' Union strike|African Mine Workers' Strike]] (Lionel and Cathy's marriage), to 1977 and the clampdown on dissidents (Rosa's detention).{{sfn|Visel|1987|pp=200<U+2013>201}} Other notable events include the coming to power of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] in 1948 (Rosa's year of birth), the Treason Trial of Nelson Mandela and others in 1956, the [[Sharpeville massacre]] in 1960, and the Soweto uprising in 1976 (Rosa's return to South Africa).{{sfn|Visel|1987|pp=200<U+2013>201}} Dominic Head writes in his book ''Nadine Gordimer'' that in ''Burger's Daughter'' "the life of ... Rosa ... runs in parallel with the history of modern South Africa".{{sfn|Head|1994|p=15}}

Several critics have called ''Burger's Daughter'' a ''[[Bildungsroman]]'', or [[coming-of-age story]],{{sfn|Visel|1987|p=179}}{{sfn|Marsh-Lockett|2012|p=192}}{{sfn|Gardner|2003|p=177}} although not the traditional ones which, according to Susan Gardner in her essay "Still Waiting for the Great Feminist Novel", are dominated by male protagonists.{{sfn|Gardner|2003|p=173}} While Gordimer is not a feminist author and ''Burger's Daughter'' is not a feminist novel,{{sfn|Gardner|2003|p=181}} Gardner suggests that the book has "a discernible woman-concerned subtext", making it "impossible for feminists to dismiss or ignore".{{sfn|Gardner|2003|p=173}} She says it has "a potential feminist awareness" that is "obscured by more conventional patriarchal writing codes".{{sfn|Gardner|2003|p=173}} Yelin writes that after the death of Rosa's mother, the statement "Already she had taken on her mother's role in the household, giving loving support to her father"{{sfn|Gordimer|1979|p=12}} illustrates "the continuing hegemony of bourgeois-patriarchal ideology" in the novel.{{sfn|Yelin|1991|p=222}} Yelin suggests that this inconsistency is responsible for Rosa's struggle, the "contradiction between feminism (Rosa's liberation as a woman) and the struggle for justice in South Africa".{{sfn|Yelin|1991|p=222}}

==Themes==
Gordimer says Rosa's role in society is imprinted on her from a young age by her activist parents,{{sfn|Gardner|1990|p=170}} and she grows up in the shadow of her father's political legacy.<ref name=Coetzee/> Scholar Carol P. Marsh-Lockett writes that everyone sees Rosa as Lionel Burger's daughter with duties and responsibilities to her father, and not Rosa the individual. In fulfilling these expectations, she denies herself an identity of her own.{{sfn|Marsh-Lockett|2012|p=193}} JanMohamed says it is only when Conrad encourages her to look beyond her self-sacrifices that Rosa starts examining the conflicts in her life, namely her commitment to help others versus her desire for a private life.{{sfn|JanMohamed|1983|pp=126<U+2013>127}} In an attempt to resolve these conflicts, Rosa contemplates turning to blacks, but she is wary of this because, according to the book's anonymous narrator, white South Africans tend to use blacks as a way "of perceiving sensual redemption, as romantics do, or of perceiving fears, as racialists do".{{sfn|Gordimer|1979|p=135}} JanMohamed notes that Rosa's father was a romantic who established genuine friendships with blacks to overcome his "sensual redemption", but she is unsure of where she stands.{{sfn|JanMohamed|1983|p=132}} Visel says that Rosa's only way to free herself from these commitments to her family and the revolution is to "defect"{{sfn|Gordimer|1979|p=264}} and go to France.{{sfn|Visel|1987|p=186}} John Cooke, in his essay "Leaving the Mother's House", notes that "By putting her defection in such stark terms, Gordimer makes her strongest statement of the need, whatever the consequence, of a child to claim a life of her own".{{sfn|Cooke|2003|p=91}}

Many of Gordimer's works have explored the impact of apartheid on individuals in South Africa.<ref name=Turgeon/> Journalist and novelist [[George Packer]] writes that, as in several of her novels, a theme in ''Burger's Daughter'' is of racially divided societies in which well-meaning whites unexpectedly encounter a side of black life they did not know about.<ref name=Packer/> Literary critic Carolyn Turgeon says that while Lionel was able to work with black activists in the ANC, Rosa discovers that with the rise of the [[Black Consciousness Movement]], many young blacks tend  to view white liberals as irrelevant in their struggle for liberation.<ref name=Turgeon/> Rosa witnesses this first hand listening to the black university student in Soweto (Duma Dhladhla) and, later, in London, her childhood friend "Baasie" (Zwelinzima Vulindlela), who both dismiss her father as unimportant.<ref name=Turgeon/>

Author and academic Louise Yelin says that Gordimer's novels often feature white South Africans opposed to apartheid and racism who try to find their place in a multiracial society. Gordimer suggested options for whites in a 1959 essay "Where Do Whites Fit In?", but the rise of Black Consciousness in the 1970s{{sfn|De Lange|1997|p=83}} questioned whites' involvement in the liberation struggle.{{sfn|Yelin|1998|p=111}} Stephen Clingman has suggested in ''The Novels of Nadine Gordimer: History from the Inside'' that ''Burger's Daughter'' is Gordimer's response to the Black Consciousness Movement and an investigation into a "role for whites in the context of Soweto and after".{{sfn|Clingman|1993|pp=7,170}}

Gordimer wrote in an essay in ''What Happened to Burger's Daughter'' that "The theme of my novel is human conflict between the desire to live a personal, private life, and the rival claim of social responsibility to one's fellow men".{{sfn|Gordimer|1980|p=20}} Dominic Head says that Gordimer's novels often experiment with the relation of "public and private realms", and that ''Burger's Daughter'' "represents one of the peaks in this experimentation".{{sfn|Head|1994|p=15}} Boyers notes that the theme of "public and private", and the relation between them, is balanced in the book "so as to privilege neither one not the other".{{sfn|Boyers|1984|p=66}}

According to Packer, another common theme in Gordimer's novels is the choices ordinary people who live in oppressive regimes are forced to make.<ref name=Packer/> Literary critics Turgeon and Carli Coetzee explain that when she realises that whites are not always welcome in the anti-apartheid liberation movements, Rosa repudiates her father's struggle and leaves the country.<ref name=Turgeon/><ref name=Coetzee/> Marsh-Lockett says that part of Rosa's struggle is forging her own identity,{{sfn|Marsh-Lockett|2012|p=193}} and this decision to rebel against her dead father is a bold step, although she does return later to South Africa to become a committed activist and ultimately a political prisoner.<ref name=Chambers/> But, according to Coetzee, what Rosa achieves is what her father never could: to have a life of her own while still remaining politically committed.<ref name=Coetzee/>

==Reception==
''Burger's Daughter'' was generally well-received by critics. [[Anthony Sampson]], a British writer, journalist and former editor of ''[[Drum (South African magazine)|Drum]]'', a magazine in Johannesburg in the 1950s, wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that this is Gordimer's "most political and most moving novel".<ref name=Sampson/> He said that its "political authenticity" set in the "historical background of real people" makes it "harshly realistic", and added that the blending of people, landscapes and politics remind one of the great Russian pre-revolutionary novels.<ref name=Sampson/> In ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', Irish politician, writer and historian [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]] compared Gordimer's writing to that of Russian novelist [[Ivan Turgenev]], and described ''Burger's Daughter'' as "elegant" and "fastidious" and belonging to a "cultivated upper class".<ref name="O'Brien"/> He said this style is not at odds with the subject matter of the story because Rosa Burger, daughter of a revolutionary, believes herself to be an "aristocrat of the revolution".<ref name="O'Brien"/>

Tess Lemmon writing in the ''[[New Internationalist]]'' magazine called ''Burger's Daughter'' "arguably [Gordimer's] best novel", and complimented her on her [[Characterization|characterisation]], attention to detail, and ability to blend "the personal and the political".<ref name=Lemmon/> Lemmon noted that the book's "subtle, lyrical writing" brings the reader into the characters' minds, which "is an enlivening but uncomfortable place to be".<ref name=Lemmon/> In an essay published in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', American novelist and critic A. G. Mojtabai stated that despite the troubled times Gordimer was living through at the time, in ''Burger's Daughter'' she remains "subdued" and "sober", and even though she "scarcely raises her voice", it still "reverberates over a full range of emotion".<ref name=Mojtabai/>

In a review of the book in ''[[World Literature Today]]'', Sheila Roberts said that Gordimer's mixture of first- and third-person narrative is "an interesting device" which is "superbly handled" by the author.<ref name="jstor40137154"/> She commented that it allows the reader to get inside Rosa, and then step back and observe her from a distance. Roberts described Gordimer's handling of Rosa's predicament, continuing the role her father had given her versus abandoning the struggle and finding herself, as "extremely moving and memorable".<ref name="jstor40137154"/> In ''[[The Sewanee Review]]'' Bruce King wrote that ''Burger's Daughter'' is a "large, richly complex, densely textured novel".<ref name="jstor27543883"/> He said that it "fill[s] with unresolvable ironies and complications" as Gordimer explores the dilemmas faced by her characters in the South African political landscape.<ref name="jstor27543883"/>

American writer [[Joseph Epstein (writer)|Joseph Epstein]] had mixed feelings about the book. He wrote in ''[[The Hudson Review]]'' that it is a novel that "gives scarcely any pleasure in the reading but which one is pleased to have read nonetheless".<ref name="jstor3850722"/> Epstein complained about it being "a mighty slow read" with "off the mark" descriptions and "stylistic infelicities".<ref name="jstor3850722"/> He felt that big subjects sometimes "relieve a novelist of the burdens of nicety of style".<ref name="jstor3850722"/> Epstein said that reading the book is like "looking at a mosaic very close up, tile by tile", and that the big picture only emerges near the end.<ref name="jstor3850722"/> But he complimented Gordimer on the way in which she unravels Rosa's fate, saying that it is "a tribute to her art".<ref name="jstor3850722"/>

==Honours and awards==
Despite being banned in South Africa, ''Burger's Daughter'' won the 1980 [[Central News Agency Literary Award|Central News Agency (CNA) Literary Award]], a prominent literary award in that country.{{sfn|Karolides|2006|p=72}}{{sfn|Marsh-Lockett|2012|p=197}} Italian writer and media analyst [[Piero Scaruffi]] listed the novel as one of the best works of literature since 1000,<ref name=Scaruffi/> and it was named one of South Africa's top 10 books in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in the United Kingdom by author [[Gillian Slovo]] in 2001.<ref name=Slovo/>

In 1991 Gordimer was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] for her works of "intense immediacy" and "extremely complicated personal and social relationships in her environment".<ref name=Nobel-press-release/> During the award ceremony speech by [[Sture All<U+00E9>n]], Permanent Secretary of the [[Swedish Academy]], ''Burger's Daughter'' was cited as one of Gordimer's novels in which "artistry and morality fuse".<ref name=Sture/>
