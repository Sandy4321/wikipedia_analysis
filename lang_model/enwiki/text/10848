The '''2007 Dr. Pepper Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Championship Game''' featured the [[2007 Boston College Eagles football team|Boston College Eagles]] and the [[2007 Virginia Tech Hokies football team|Virginia Tech Hokies]] in a regular-season [[college football]] game that determined the conference's champion for the [[2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2007 season]]. Virginia Tech defeated Boston College 30&ndash;16 to win the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] football championship. The game, held at [[Jacksonville Municipal Stadium]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], was a rematch of a regular-season game that took place on October 25, in [[Blacksburg, Virginia]]. In that game, Boston College, courtesy of a late-game comeback by [[quarterback]] [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]], won 14&ndash;10.

Following the loss, Virginia Tech won five straight games to win the Coastal Division of the ACC, while Boston College stumbled, losing two games before defeating the Clemson Tigers to win the Atlantic Division and representation in the Championship Game. Most pre-game media coverage of the event cast the game as an opportunity for Virginia Tech to avenge its earlier loss. In addition, the winner of the game would be awarded an automatic bid to the [[Bowl Championship Series]] [[2008 Orange Bowl]] game in [[Miami, Florida]] on January 3, 2008. Despite Boston College's earlier win over Virginia Tech, [[spread betting|spread bettors]] favored Virginia Tech by five points.

In the opening quarter of the game, the Eagles took a 7&ndash;0 lead on a 51-yard [[fumble]] [[Glossary of American football#R|return]] for a [[touchdown]]. The Eagles' offense dominated the first half of the game statistically, but failed to add to its early lead until the second quarter, when a [[field goal]] made it 10&ndash;0. Virginia Tech answered with a touchdown of their own, but Boston College responded with a seven-play, 74-yard touchdown drive of its own. Then came perhaps the most pivotal play of the game. During the [[extra point]] kick following the Boston College touchdown, Virginia Tech's Duane Brown blocked the kick, which was caught by the Hokies' [[cornerback]] Brandon Flowers, who returned it 75&nbsp;yards for a defensive [[two-point conversion]].

The play changed the momentum of the game. Virginia Tech added a tying touchdown before [[halftime]], and after a scoreless third quarter, two Matt Ryan [[interception (football)|interception]]s resulted in 14&nbsp;points for Virginia Tech and a 30&ndash;16 Virginia Tech win. With the victory, the Hokies earned their second Atlantic Coast Conference football championship in four&nbsp;years and their first [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] bid since 1996.

==Pre-game buildup==
In the weeks leading up to the game, there was much media discussion of the future site of the game due to Jacksonville's expiring contract to host the ACC Championship.<ref name="AP Slumping"/> The media also discussed whether Virginia Tech would be out for revenge against Boston College after its last-second defeat in Blacksburg on October 25.<ref name="AP Rematch">[http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/WireStory?id=3938892&page=1 Rebounding Hokies Ready for Rematch] Mark Long, The Associated Press, November 30, 2007.

Media attention was also directed at the teams' offensive capabilities.

On the ground, Taylor's offensive [[scramble|scrambling]], while effective, was not Virginia Tech's primary [[Rush (American football)|rushing]] weapon.

The Boston College ground offense was led by [[running back (American football)|running back]] Andre Callender, who had perhaps his biggest game of the year during the division-clinching match against Clemson two weeks earlier.

===Defensive matchups===
Virginia Tech's defense was considered stronger than that of Boston College. For the ACC Championship Game, Virginia Tech returned senior [[linebacker]] [[Vince Hall]] to the starting lineup. Hall had sat out four straight games, including the previous Boston College match, after suffering a broken [[forearm]] and [[wrist]].<ref name="AP Rematch"/><ref>The Associated Press, "Virginia Tech's Hall to return vs. Miami".

On Virginia Tech's defensive secondary, [[Brandon Flowers]], one of Tech's starting [[cornerback (American football)|cornerback]]s, was a second-team All-ACC defensive selection and had five&nbsp;interceptions in the season.<ref name="VT Game Notes"/> Assisting Flowers would be [[Victor Harris|Victor "Macho" Harris]], who had also netted five&nbsp;interceptions during the regular season. During the 2007&nbsp;season, [[Sports Illustrated]] called the two "maybe the finest cornerback duo in America."<ref name="VT Game Notes"/>

At the end of the regular season, Boston College was ranked 26th nationally in total defense, and 2nd nationally in run defense.<ref name="TSL preview"/> Its pass defense, however, was ranked 106th in the country, and since Boston College was without senior cornerback DeJuan Tribble, who was recovering from a [[sprain]]ed knee [[ligament]],<ref name="AP Rematch"/> it was expected that the Eagles' linebackers would have to play a very good game to stop Virginia Tech's passing offense. Jo-Lonn Dunbar, who had been named to the preseason watch list for the [[Bronko Nagurski Trophy]] (awarded to the top defensive player in the country) was expected to fill the gaps and stop both rushing and passing elements of Virginia Tech's offense.<ref name="Champs Bowl Game Notes"/>

In addition, [[safety (American football)|safety]] [[Jamie Silva]] would have to play a strong game to support the Boston College cornerback replacing the injured Tribble. Silva, an All-ACC defensive selection, led the team with five interceptions and was very good in moving up to stop the run as well.<ref name="TSL preview"/> On the [[defensive line]], [[defensive end (American football)|defensive end]] Nick Larkin was a quarterfinalist for the [[Lott Trophy]], an award given to the defensive player with the most "defensive impact" nationally.<ref name="Champs Bowl Game Notes">"2007 Champs Sports Bowl Game Notes", Boston College Athletics Communications Office, December 2007.

===First quarter===
[[Image:ACC Championship 2007 opening play.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]] (#12, far right) and the Boston College Eagles line up on offense on the opening play]]
Virginia Tech won the opening coin toss and deferred its option to the second half. Boston College received the opening [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]], which was downed in the [[end zone]] for a [[touchback]]. Starting at their own 20-yard line, the Eagles advanced down the field as quarterback Matt Ryan completed several passes and running back Andre Callender contributed several long runs. A [[pass interference]] call against Virginia Tech, coupled with a 10-yard run by Callender, put Boston College at the Virginia Tech 26-yard line. After three consecutive [[incomplete pass]]es, Eagles kicker [[Steve Aponavicius]] attempted a 36-yard [[field goal]]. During the field goal, Virginia Tech [[special teams]] player [[Duane Brown]] broke through the Eagles' line and blocked the kick, giving Virginia Tech possession of the ball.<ref name="1st"/>

Virginia Tech's offense, led by quarterback Sean Glennon, began their first possession at their own 37-yard line. However, a [[quarterback sack|sack]], a [[Tackle (football move)|tackle]] for loss, and an incomplete pass denied the Hokies' offense positive yardage and they were forced to [[Punt (football)|punt]]. Tech punter [[Brent Bowden]] managed a 54-yard kick that forced the Eagles to start at their own 14-yard line, but three big plays of 16, 19, and 19&nbsp;yards drove the Eagles deep into Virginia Tech territory. As before, however, Virginia Tech's defense stiffened and Boston College was forced into a [[Down (American football)|fourth down]]. Instead of attempting a long field goal, the Eagles instead attempted to convert the fourth down but were foiled by an incomplete pass.<ref name="1st"/>

On the Hokies' second offensive possession, quarterback Tyrod Taylor took the field in place of Sean Glennon. Two successful passes and two short runs resulted in two [[Down (American football)|first downs]] and Virginia Tech advanced the ball across the 50-yard line and into Boston College territory. As Taylor attempted to scramble for yet another short run, however, he was tackled behind the [[line of scrimmage]] and [[fumble]]d the ball. The loose ball was scooped up by Boston College defender Jamie Silva, who returned it 51&nbsp;yards for a touchdown. The touchdown and subsequent extra point were the first points of the game and gave Boston College a 7&ndash;0 lead with 4&nbsp;minutes remaining in the quarter.<ref name="1st"/>

After the kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense again failed to advance the ball. After a [[three-and-out]], the Hokies again punted. The ball traveled 44&nbsp;yards, forcing the Eagles to start at their own 21-yard line. As the quarter came to a close, the Eagles drove the ball deep into Virginia Tech territory.<ref name="1st"/> At the end of the first quarter, Boston College led 7&ndash;0.<ref name="1st">[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=273350103 1st Qtr Play-by-Play] ESPN.com, December 1, 2007. Accessed December 9, 2007.</ref>

===Second quarter===
At the beginning of the second quarter, the Hokies' defense began to stiffen. Aided by a 10-yard holding penalty against the Eagles, Matt Ryan was forced to complete a 14-yard pass on 4th-and-9 to earn a first down and keep the drive alive. Three incomplete passes followed, however, and the Eagles again settled for a field goal attempt. This time, the 37-yard kick sailed through the [[goalposts|uprights]], giving Boston College a 10&ndash;0 lead with 11:20 remaining in the first half.<ref name="2nd"/>

Virginia Tech's first offensive drive of the second quarter began on an auspicious note as quarterback Sean Glennon completed a 16-yard pass to [[wide receiver (American football)|wide receiver]] [[Josh Morgan]]. Following the play, a Boston College player committed a [[American football rules#Fouls and their Penalties|personal foul]], which added 15&nbsp;yards to the end of the pass. Another long pass by Glennon, coupled with yet another Boston College penalty, put Virginia Tech deep into the [[red zone]], and the Hokies scored on a 5-yard touchdown pass to Morgan. With 8:15 remaining in the first half, Virginia Tech narrowed Boston College's lead to just three&nbsp;points.<ref name="2nd"/>

[[Image:Ryan backed up on goaline.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]] and the Boston College offense (dark [[uniform]]s) are backed up deep in their own territory as the first half comes to an end.]]

On the ensuing possession, Boston College needed only seven plays and just under three minutes to travel 74&nbsp;yards. The drive culminated in a 14-yard quarterback scramble for a touchdown.<ref name="Instant Analysis">[http://cfn.scout.com/2/707296.html Instant Analysis: ACC Championship Game] Matt Zemek, Scout.com, December 1, 2007. Accessed December 10, 2007.</ref> Duane Brown, who had blocked the first Boston College field goal attempt, again charged through the Boston College [[offensive line]] and blocked the extra point attempt. This time, the ball bounced into the hands of Virginia Tech's Brandon Flowers, who returned it 75&nbsp;yards for a defensive [[two-point conversion]]. The play kept Boston College's lead within a single touchdown and extra point.<ref name="Instant Analysis"/> With 5:27 remaining in the half, the score was now 16&ndash;9 in favor of Boston College.<ref name="2nd"/>

Tech quarterback Sean Glennon's first pass of the new possession, long throw downfield, was intercepted by Boston College defender [[Jamie Silva]]. The length of the pass meant that Boston College did not have good field position following the [[turnover (football)|turnover]]. After earning a quick first down, the Eagles were stopped and forced to punt. With 2:13 remaining before halftime, the Hokies had one more offensive opportunity.<ref name="2nd"/>

Beginning at their own 20-yard line, the Virginia Tech offense marched down the field. Running back Branden Ore ran 11&nbsp;yards for a first down, and two long passes from Sean Glennon to wide receiver [[Eddie Royal]] put the Hokies into scoring position. After failing to gain first downs with short runs, Virginia Tech was forced to use its [[timeout]]s to stop the clock and the first half from ending before they had a chance to score. On a 3rd-and-7 from the Boston College 13-yard line, Glennon finally connected with wide receiver Josh Hyman, who crossed into the end zone for a touchdown. The extra point tied the game, 16&ndash;16.<ref name="2nd"/>

With no time left to mount an answering drive, Boston College received the kickoff and let time run out. Heading into [[halftime]], the two teams were tied, 16&ndash;16.<ref name="2nd">[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=273350103&period=2 2nd Qtr Play-by-Play] ESPN.com, December 1, 2007.

===Third quarter===
[[Image:Glennon under center ACC championship.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sean Glennon]] (far right, [[Center (American football)|under center]]), was the game's MVP.]]
Because they deferred their selection to the second half during the opening coin toss, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the half. The Hokies continued to rotate between quarterbacks Sean Glennon and Tyrod Taylor during the possession, and picked up two first downs, one through the air and the other on the ground. After Glennon was sacked at the 50-yard line, however, the drive sputtered and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball.<ref name="3rd"/>

Boston College, in their first possession of the second half, fared even worse than Virginia Tech did. Two incomplete passes and a 5-yard [[delay of game]] penalty forced Boston College into a three-and-out possession that resulted in a punt. On its second possession, Virginia Tech had a three-and-out drive, thanks in part to an 11-yard sack of Sean Glennon by Boston College's Kevin Atkins.<ref name="3rd"/>

After receiving the punt, Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan connected on a 31-yard pass to wide receiver Brandon Robinson. As before, however, the offense stalled. On 4th-and-1 from the Virginia Tech 30-yard line, Ryan attempted a pass that fell incomplete, [[down (American football)|turning the ball over on downs]]. As a result of pressure applied by the Boston College defense, the Hokies continued to have difficulty moving the ball.<ref name="3rd"/>

The Hokies were forced to punt again, and Brent Bowden's 50-yard punt stuck the Eagles deep in their own territory. The drive began with a five-yard penalty against Boston College and culminated two plays later in a six-yard loss on a sack of Matt Ryan by Hokie defender Barry Booker. Boston College punted, but the kick by Johnny Ayers traveled just 34&nbsp;yards before sailing [[out of bounds]].<ref name="3rd"/>

Virginia Tech had good starting field position at their own 44-yard line. One quick first down later, the clock ran out on the third&nbsp;quarter.<ref name="3rd"/> As neither team had scored in the quarter, the score remained tied at 16&ndash;16.<ref name="3rd">[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=273350103&period=3 3rd Qtr Play-by-Play], ESPN.com, December 1, 2007.

===Fourth quarter===
[[Image:07ACCCG VT Touchdown.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Virginia Tech fans celebrate as [[Hokie]] [[wide receiver]] Eddie Royal (center, prone) catches a go-ahead touchdown pass halfway through the fourth quarter]]
Despite starting almost at midfield, the offensive drive that began at the end of the third quarter failed to reach field goal range, and the Hokies were forced to punt. Boston College's offense fared no better, however, and punted after a [[three-and-out]] possession. The ball was downed at the Virginia Tech 16-yard line, and the Hokies began their first full offensive possession of the fourth&nbsp;quarter.<ref name="4th"/>

After an incomplete pass from quarterback Tyrod Taylor, the Hokies got their first big offensive break of the second half. On a designed play, Taylor scrambled for 31&nbsp;yards, the largest play in the game for the Hokies. Two successful runs by running back Branden Ore followed, earning the Hokies 23&nbsp;more yards and pushing the offense deep into Boston College territory. A false-start penalty set the Hokie offense back, but on the next play, quarterback Sean Glennon connected with wide receiver Eddie Royal on a 24-yard strike for a touchdown. The touchdown and extra point were the first points of the second half and gave Virginia Tech a 23&ndash;16 lead with 6:30 remaining in the game.<ref name="4th"/>

Boston College began its second possession of the fourth quarter knowing it had to score a [[touchdown]] to tie the game. Quarterback Matt Ryan had his best success of the day, connecting on seven&nbsp;of ten&nbsp;passes during the drive and picking up 58&nbsp;yards. All of the Eagles' yardage on the drive came through the air, and with 2:25 remaining, the Eagles found themselves at the Virginia Tech 14-yard line. Facing a fourth down and needing four&nbsp;yards for a first down, Matt Ryan fell back to attempt a pass. The throw was intercepted by Virginia Tech's Vince Hall.<ref name="4th"/>

Starting at its own 10-yard line, Virginia Tech ran three straight running plays in an effort to run the clock down and prevent Boston College from having enough time to conduct another offensive drive. After the third run was stopped for no gain, however, the Hokies were forced to punt the ball. Boston College now had 28&nbsp;seconds to score a touchdown and either tie the game with an extra point or win it with a two-point conversion.<ref name="4th"/> 

[[Image:07ACCCG Scoreboard final.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The final scoreboard of the 2007 ACC Championship Game records the 30&ndash;16 final score and congratulates Virginia Tech on its victory.]]
The Boston College drive began on its own 35-yard line. With little time remaining, Boston College would have to complete one or more [[Hail Mary pass]]es. Although the odds of completing one such pass, let alone several, were very low, many Virginia Tech fans remained worried, as Boston College had previously beaten the Hokies in similar circumstances earlier in the season.<ref name="1BC"/> Matt Ryan's first two passes fell incomplete, and his third was [[interception|intercepted]] by Virginia Tech's [[Xavier Adibi]] and returned 40&nbsp;yards for a Virginia Tech touchdown.<ref name="4th"/>

The score came with 11&nbsp;seconds remaining and gave Virginia Tech its final lead, 30&ndash;16. With no chance to win, Boston College elected to let the clock run out after receiving the [[kickoff]]. Virginia Tech won the 2007 ACC Championship, 30&ndash;16.<ref name="4th">[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=273350103&period=4 4th Qtr Play-by-Play] ESPN.com, December 1, 2007.

Two-thirds of Virginia Tech's 300&nbsp;[[total offense|total offensive]] yardage came via passes from quarterbacks Sean Glennon (174&nbsp;yards) and Tyrod Taylor (28&nbsp;yards).<ref name="team stats"/><ref name="game notes"/>  Glennon's three passing [[touchdown]]s tied an ACC Championship Game record set by former Virginia Tech quarterback [[Marcus Vick]] in [[2005 ACC Championship Game|2005]].<ref name="game notes"/> Glennon also set the ACC Championship Game record for pass completion percentage (66.7%) by completing 18 of his 27&nbsp;passes. Taylor, meanwhile, set ACC Championship Game records for longest run and longest quarterback run with a 31-yard scramble in the second quarter that helped set up the tying touchdown for Virginia Tech.<ref name="game notes"/> Taylor finished the game with 36&nbsp;[[Rush (American football)|rushing]] yards, the third-most of any player in the game.<ref name="Indy stats"/>

On the ground, Taylor's performance was supplemented by Tech [[running back]] Branden Ore, who led all rushers with 55&nbsp;yards on 19&nbsp;[[Rush (American football)|rushes]].<ref name="Indy stats"/> Fourteen&nbsp;of Ore's 55&nbsp;yards came on a single play halfway through the fourth quarter when the Boston College's defensive line gave way, admitting Tech's runner into the [[Defensive back|defensive secondary]].<ref name="4th"/> The run helped set up Virginia Tech's go-ahead touchdown later in the fourth quarter. Capping Tech's ground game were complimentary performances by Kenny Lewis and Sean Glennon, each of whom earned fewer than 10&nbsp;yards, but picked up first downs on two plays.<ref name="Indy stats"/>

Leading all Tech [[Wide receiver|receivers]] was Josh Morgan, who caught eight passes for 55&nbsp;yards and a touchdown.<ref name="Indy stats"/> Eddie Royal also had an excellent game for the Hokies, catching two&nbsp;long passes of 18&nbsp;yards and 11&nbsp;yards on subsequent plays in the second quarter. Royal's 2&nbsp;catches drove the Hokies deep into Boston College territory, setting up a 13-yard touchdown pass to Josh Hyman that tied the game at [[halftime]].<ref name="2nd"/> Royal's biggest play, however, came halfway through the fourth quarter when he caught the go-ahead touchdown pass from Sean Glennon. The 24-yard reception was Royal's longest catch of the day, and the touchdown gave the Hokies a lead they would not relinquish for the rest of the game.<ref name="2nd"/>

Though its offense performed well, it was Virginia Tech's [[special teams]] and [[American football strategy#Defensive strategy|defense]] that earned it the win. Duane Brown's twin [[Field goal (football)#Missed and blocked field goals|blocked kick]]s were the first blocks recorded in ACC Championship Game history and were the 116th and 117th blocked kicks recorded at Virginia Tech under head coach [[Frank Beamer]].<ref name="game notes"/> In addition to the blocks, Tech special teams excelled on punts and [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]]s. Tech punter Brent Bowden finished the day with seven punts for a total of 324&nbsp;yards.<ref name="Indy stats"/> A 54-yard kick in the first quarter was the fourth-longest punt in ACC Championship Game history.<ref name="game notes"/>

On [[American football strategy#Defensive strategy|defense]], [[linebacker]] Vince Hall, in his second game after recovering from a broken [[forearm]], led all defensive players with 11&nbsp;[[Tackle (football move)|tackle]]s. Hall also recorded an interception in the late stages of the fourth quarter that allowed Virginia Tech to run down the clock and force Boston College into a hasty offense. Tied for third overall was Tech's Xavier Adibi, who recorded nine tackles (one for loss) and caught the game-ending interception. Adibi returned the interception 40&nbsp;yards for a defensive touchdown that sealed the victory for the Hokies.<ref name="defensive stats">[http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/acc/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/07fbchamp_box.pdf Defensive Statistics (Final) (PDF)] The Atlantic Coast Conference, December 1, 2007.

Though Boston College lost the game on the scoreboard, it won almost every statistical category. Quarterback Matt Ryan outperformed both Hokie quarterbacks combined in passing yardage, throwing for 305&nbsp;yards.<ref name="Indy stats"/> Ryan was extremely accurate through the air in the fourth quarter, throwing eight straight complete passes, an ACC Championship Game record.<ref name="game notes"/> Ryan also was surprisingly successful on the ground, [[Rush (American football)|rushing]] for Boston College's touchdown of the game&mdash;a 14-yard sprint in the second quarter that put Boston College ahead 16&ndash;7.<ref name="2nd"/> 

In the first half, the Eagles offense recorded 20&nbsp;first downs. In the second half, it managed just four first downs, three of which came in one drive in the fourth quarter.<ref name="game notes"/> As a result of second-half pressure from Virginia Tech, Ryan was forced into two late-game [[interception (football)|interception]]s, including one that was returned for a Virginia Tech defensive touchdown.<ref name="4th"/>

Ryan finished the game with 35&nbsp;rushing yards, just one short of Hokie quarterback Tyrod Taylor, who had been highly promoted as a runner heading into the game.<ref name="Indy stats"/> Ryan finished fourth among all rushers, and Eagle running back Andre Callender, the sole running back on the Eagles' roster, finished second, rushing for 51&nbsp;yards in the game. Callender game-long 11-yard run helped set up the Eagles for a field goal attempt early in the second quarter.<ref name="2nd"/>

Callender's true success, however, was in the passing game, where he accrued 92&nbsp;yards, putting him first among all receivers in the game.<ref name="Indy stats"/> Callender's 13&nbsp;catches were an ACC Championship Game record and were the fourth-highest total for a receiver in any game in ACC history.<ref name="game notes"/> Wide receiver Kevin Challenger finished the game with 4&nbsp;catches for 45&nbsp;yards, while the Eagles' Rich Gunnell finished the game with 54&nbsp;yards. Surprisingly for the number of [[Reception (American football)|receiving]] yards recorded by the Eagles in the game, no Boston College receiver caught a touchdown.<ref name="Indy stats"/>

Boston College punter Johnny Ayres kicked four&nbsp;[[pun]]ts a total of 159&nbsp;yards, including one long kick that traveled 55&nbsp;yards and set the mark for the third-longest punt in ACC Championship Game history.<ref name="Indy stats"/> Kicker Steve Aponavicius successfully kicked a 37-yard [[field goal]] early in the second quarter. but after his second&nbsp;kick was blocked, Boston College head coach [[Jeff Jagodzinski]] seemed reluctant to try long field goals and instead sent in the offense to attempt to convert the fourth down. Out of four tries, only one fourth down was converted into a first down.<ref name="team stats"/>

On [[American football strategy#Defensive strategy|defense]], Boston College had more success than predicted by pre-game coverage. Jamie Silva's fumble return for a touchdown was the first defensive score in ACC Championship Game history.<ref name="game notes"/> Silva finished the game with five [[Tackle (football move)|tackle]]s (one for loss), one&nbsp;[[interception (football)|interception]], the forced fumble, and the defensive touchdown. DeLeon Gause, meanwhile, was the Eagles' leading tackler, recording 10&nbsp;stops including one tackle for loss. Altogether, the Eagles recorded four&nbsp;sacks and nine&nbsp;tackles for loss, holding the [[Hokie]] offense in check for most of the game.<ref name="defensive stats"/>

==Post-game effects==
Virginia Tech's victory in the ACC Championship Game had far-reaching sporting consequences for the [[NCAA football bowl games, 2007-08|2007&ndash;2008 college football bowl season]] and in the future site of the ACC Championship Game. The 2007&nbsp;game injected approximately $10&nbsp;million into the Jacksonville economy. Thousands of hotel rooms were filled by fans traveling to the game, and the impact they created was larger than that of the previous year's game, which featured teams that had shorter distances to travel and whose fans had generated less demand for overnight accommodation.<ref>[http://www.bizjournals.com/triad/stories/2007/12/03/daily46.html Jacksonville sees bigger boost from ACC football championship] The Business Journal of the Greater Triad Area, December 7, 2007. Accessed December 12, 2007.</ref> Despite the fact that fans spent more in 2007 than at any previous ACC Championship Game, poor ticket sales at the box office necessitated a move.

===2008 ACC Championship Game===

[[Image:Raymondjamesstadium.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Raymond James Stadium]] in [[Tampa, Florida]] was selected as the site of the 2008 ACC Championship Game following poor attendance in Jacksonville.]]
After poor attendance in the ACC Championship Game at Jacksonville for the second straight year, ACC officials and representatives of the conference's member schools elected not to extend the Gator Bowl Association's contract to host the game.<ref name="2008 site">[http://www.theacc.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/121207aaa.html ACC Announces Future Sites for Football Championship Game] The Atlantic Coast Conference, December 12, 2007. Accessed December 12, 2007.</ref> On December 12, the ACC announced that [[Tampa, Florida]] would host the game in 2008 and 2009 and [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] would host the game in 2010 and 2011.<ref name="2008 site"/>

The cities were chosen based on bids presented to the ACC and its member schools. Each city requested and was granted a two-year contract, locking the ACC into the locations well in advance of the actual games. Tampa was chosen as the site of the 2008&nbsp;game because Charlotte was scheduled to hold the annual [[convention]] of the [[Association for Career and Technical Education]] at the same time as the game, and adequate hotel space would not be ready in time for the two events.<ref>[http://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2007/12/10/daily20.html ACC title game going to Tampa and Charlotte] Tony Quesada, ''Jacksonville Business Journal'', December 12, 2007.

===Bowl effects===
With its win, Virginia Tech clinched an automatic bid to the [[2008 Orange Bowl]].<ref>[http://www.hokiesports.com/football/recaps/20071202aaa.html Hokies to face Kansas in FedEx Orange Bowl] Virginia Tech Sports Information Department, December 3, 2007. Accessed December 10, 2007.</ref> This caused ripple effects in the bowl destinations for virtually every bowl-eligible ACC team.<ref name="ACC bowl games hinge">[http://www.newsadvance.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=LNA%2FMGArticle%2FLNA_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1173353678564&path=!sports Multiple bowl destinations hinge on ACC title game] Andy Bitter, the ''News-Advance'', November 30, 2007. Accessed December 13, 2007.</ref> In the 2007 season, the ACC had guaranteed tie-ins with eight bowl games.<ref>[http://www.theacc.com/sports/m-footbl/07-acc-bowls.html 2007-08 Atlantic Coast Conference Bowl Tie-Ins and BCS Bowl Schedule] The Atlantic Coast Conference. Accessed December 13, 2007.</ref> 

The ACC's representatives to these bowls were picked in a hierarchical system that allowed the [[2007 Chick-fil-A Bowl|Chic-fil-A Bowl]] to have the first selection after the Orange Bowl's automatic pick of the winner of the ACC Championship Game. Following the Chick-fil-A Bowl were the Gator Bowl, [[Champs Sports Bowl]], [[Music City Bowl]], [[Meineke Car Care Bowl]], [[Emerald Bowl]], and [[Humanitarian Bowl]], in that order. The ACC's agreement with the bowls dictated that the bowls would select the highest-ranking ACC team left after the bowls with higher selections made their pick. Bowls would be allowed to skip the highest remaining team only if the next team was within one conference win of the highest remaining team. Therefore, a bowl could select a 5&ndash;3 team over a 6&ndash;2 team, but could not select a 4&ndash;4 team over a 6&ndash;2 team.<ref>[http://www.theacc.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/100107aaa.html 2007 Bowl Selection Process for Atlantic Coast Conference Teams] The Atlantic Coast Conference, October 1, 2007.

With Virginia Tech earning an automatic bid to the Orange Bowl, the Chick-fil-A Bowl had the first pick of the remaining ACC teams. Boston College, by virtue of its loss in the ACC Championship Game, was the highest remaining team, but Chick-fil-A Bowl representatives instead chose to invite Clemson, which had finished behind Boston College in the Atlantic Division standings.<ref name="bowl bids">[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2836420 2007-08 Bowl schedule] ESPN.com, December 2, 2007. Accessed December 13, 2007.</ref> In making their decision, Chick-fil-A Bowl representatives cited Boston College's poor attendance at the ACC Championship Game in Jacksonville.<ref name="CFA Bowl selection">[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=schlabach_mark&id=3142612 Team selection an extended process for Chick-fil-A Bowl] Mark Schlabach, ESPN.com, December 6, 2007. Accessed December 13, 2007.</ref> The Gator Bowl, which is also held in Jacksonville, was reluctant to choose a team that had participated in the ACC Championship Game out of feat that the team's fans would be unwilling to return to Jacksonville so quickly. The Gator Bowl Association requested and received a waiver from the league's strict bowl selection rules and selected Virginia over Boston College.<ref name="bowl bids"/><ref>[http://jacksonville.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2006/12/18/story1.html ACC gives Gator Bowl more flexibility] Tony Quesada, Jacksonville Business Journal, December 15, 2006.

The Champs Sports Bowl was thus forced to select Boston College.<ref name="bowl bids"/> Boston College players and fans, owing to the decreased status of the Champs Sports Bowl when compared with the Orange, Chick-fil-A, and Gator Bowls, were disappointed with the selection and match against Michigan State.<ref>[http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071211/SPORTS07/71211061/1162/COL11 Champs Sports Bowl: Boston College didn't want to face Michigan State] The Detroit Free Press, December 11, 2007. Accessed December 13, 2007.</ref> Had Boston College won the ACC Championship Game, it would have earned the automatic bid to the Orange Bowl, and Virginia Tech would have been selected by the Chick-fil-A Bowl, which had earlier expressed an interest in inviting the Hokies to the game for a [[2006 Chick-fil-A Bowl|second straight year]].<ref name="CFA Bowl selection"/> Clemson would have been bumped down to the Gator Bowl, and Virginia would have been forced into the Champs Sports Bowl.<ref name="ACC bowl games hinge"/>
