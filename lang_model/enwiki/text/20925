==Career==
Born in [[South Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], the son of [[New Zealand national soccer team|New Zealand]] [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]] representative [[Dave Bright]], Kris Bright started his football career with [[Manurewa AFC]] in his home city.<ref>{{cite web| title=2005 NZ U20 Profiles| url=http://www.nzsoccer.com/page/2005_u20_profiles.html| work=NZ Soccer| accessdate=October 4, 2006}}</ref> Bright then played for several clubs throughout New Zealand, including a stint with [[North Shore United]] in early 2004, before joining [[Waitakere City F.C.|Waitakere City]] in late April. Whilst with Waitakere, Bright was the 2004 top scorer in the [[Northern League (New Zealand)|Northern Premier League]], and played in the club's 0-1 loss to [[Miramar Rangers]] in the final of the 2004 [[Chatham Cup]].<ref name="apprenticeship">{{cite web| title=Knights confirm apprenticeship scheme and finalise squad of 20| url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060822015538/www.nzknights.com/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=1067&pageid=432| date=June 21, 2005| accessdate=October 4, 2006}}</ref> Over two seasons, as a semi-professional with Waitakere City, Bright scored a total of 29 goals before heading to [[England]] to trial for [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham FC]].<ref name="sittard">{{cite web| title=Twee spitsen vanaf maandag op proef| url=http://www.fortunasittard.nl/index.jsp?content=1070&archive=1| language=[[Dutch language|Dutch]]| date=August 20, 2006| accessdate=October 4, 2006}}</ref> The trial was unsuccessful, and Bright returned home to play for [[Canterbury United]] in the [[New Zealand Football Championship]] during 2005.<ref name="NZu20">{{cite web| title=New Zealand squad named to play in Oceania qualifiers| url=http://www.nzsoccer.com/files/u20_final_squad.pdf| work=NZ Soccer| format=pdf| accessdate=October 4, 2006}}</ref>


In mid-2005, Bright was named as one of three players (alongside [[Sam Jasper]] and [[Jeremy Christie]]) in the [[New Zealand Knights]]' apprenticeship scheme through the [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic Youth Academy]].<ref name="apprenticeship"/> He did not join the full-time squad of the [[A-League]] club, and in the meantime had transferred to [[Waitakere United]] for the 2005&ndash;06 NZFC season.<ref>{{cite web| title=New Zealand &ndash; National League preview| url=http://www.oceaniafootball.com/index.cgi?det=1&intArticleID=1771&sID=12| work=Oceania Football Confederation| date=October 22, 2005| accessdate=October 4, 2006}}</ref> Shortly after the start of the season, though, Knights player [[Neil Emblen]] suffered a [[knee]] injury and was forced onto the injured list, which would allow the club to sign Bright as a replacement for four weeks.<ref>{{cite web| title=Bright gets big chance as Emblen ruled out| url=http://www.nzknights.com/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=2129| date=October 27, 2005| accessdate=October 4, 2006}}</ref> Bright was rushed into the squad to play the [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]] at [[North Harbour Stadium]],<ref>{{cite web| title=Knights look on the Bright side| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=242&ObjectID=10352555| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| last=Maddaford| first=Terry| date=October 29, 2005| accessdate=October 4, 2006}}</ref> and played the full 90 minutes on debut as the New Zealand side went down 1-3.<ref>{{cite web| title=Match Summary: New Zealand Knights FC vs Central Coast Mariners FC| url=http://www.a-league.com.au/scoreboard/0000260089/scoreboard.html| date=October 29, 2005| accessdate=October 4, 2006}}</ref> Bright's performance in his first match earned praise from Knights manager [[John Adshead]], and he was rewarded with a starting place in the following match against the [[Newcastle United Jets]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Knights build Kiwi contingent| url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411749/624348| work=One Sport| date=November 3, 2005| accessdate=October 4, 2006}}</ref> Again Bright played the full match, and received an early [[Misconduct (football)#Cautionable offences (yellow card)|yellow card]] in the 2-4 loss.<ref>{{cite web| title=Match Summary: New Zealand Knights FC vs Newcastle Jets FC| url=http://www.a-league.com.au/scoreboard/0000260092/scoreboard.html| date=November 4, 2005| accessdate=October 4, 2006}}</ref> Bright appeared in the Knights's following four games up until Emblen's return from injury, but had done enough to retain his position in the squad, having signed another short-term contract, this time to cover for [[Joshua Rose]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Emblen back to face Sydney| url=http://www.nzknights.com/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=2804| date=December 29, 2005| accessdate=October 4, 2006}}</ref> By the end of the [[A-League 2005-06|2005&ndash;06 season]], Bright had made a total of 12 appearances, three from the interchange bench.

Although he was not signed by Kilmarnock, Bright remained in Europe, and in late August began trialling with [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Eerste Divisie]] club [[Fortuna Sittard]],<ref name="sittard"/> including a match against FC Geleen-Zuid scoring 1 goal.<ref name="sittard2">{{cite web| title=Kris Bright voor <U+00E9><U+00E9>n jaar Fortunees| url=http://www.fortunasittard.nl/index.jsp?content=1297&archive=1| language=Dutch| date=August 31, 2006| accessdate=October 4, 2006}}</ref> Bright subsequently landed a one year contract with the club, with the option of a further year; despite earlier reports, the deal was only finalised as the transfer window closed.<ref name="sittard2"/><ref>{{cite web| title=Fortuna Sittard land Kiwi striker Bright| url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/article.php?id=9968| work=Tribal Football| date=August 31, 2006| accessdate=October 4, 2006}}</ref>

Bright managed to gain a spot in the starting line-up for the struggling Dutch side. He played in eleven league games, in which he scored one goal, against HFC Haarlem. He also played part in Fortuna's dramatic Cup loss to non-league Rijnsburgse Boys.

After his contract with the Dutch side was not renewed for the 2007 season, he signed a six month contract with Norwegian Division 2 club Kristiansund BK. There he scored 11 goals in seven games, against Levanger (1), Lillestrom (2), Hodd (1), Baerum (1), Valarenga (2) & Steinkjer (4).

With two games remaining in the season and several Norwegian Tippeligaen & Addecoligaen clubs following his progress, Bright suffered a broken leg. Bright then renewed his contract with Kristiansund BK until July 2009.

After 6 months of recovery, Bright then made his return in the 2008 season opener against Strindheim. He continued his goal scoring form with 2 goals including a 25 metre free-kick to help Kristiansund to a 3-1 win. After playing 12 games, he was 2nd top goal-scorer in the league with 10 goals. Also, in the 3rd round of the Norwegian Cup, Bright scored KBK's only goal against [[Tippeligaen]] club & close rivals [[Molde F.K.]] in a 2-1 extra-time loss.

In January 2009 Bright signed a 1 and a 1/2 year contract with [[Greek Super League]] side [[Panserraikos F.C.]], he was given the #32 shirt. He left the Club in July 2009 by mutual consent with a year remaining on his contract, and joined English [[League Two]] side [[Shrewsbury Town]] on August 3, 2009. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/shrewsbury/8182184.stm | work=BBC News | title=Shrewsbury secure double signing | date=August 3, 2009 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref>
