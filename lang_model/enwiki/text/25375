[[Image:Latin_letter_<U+00C5>.png|right|<U+00C5><U+00E5>]]

'''"<U+00C5>"''', or '''"<U+00E5>"''', is a [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]], representing a [[vowel]], in the [[Swedish alphabet|Swedish]], [[Danish alphabet|Danish]], [[Norwegian alphabet|Norwegian]], [[Walloon language|Walloon]], [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]] and [[Istro-Romanian language]] [[alphabet]]s. In  [[Finnish alphabet|Finnish]], "<U+00C5>" is used only in Scandinavian names. Other alphabets using the letter include [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]], [[Lule Sami]], [[Skolt Sami]] and [[Southern Sami|Southern Sami alphabet]].

The letter "<U+00C5>" is often perceived as an "[[A]]" with a [[ring (diacritic)|ring]], interpreting the ring as a [[diacritic]]al mark. However, the ring is not a diacritic. Rather, the letter developed as a form of semi-[[Ligature (typography)|ligature]] of an "A" with a small "a" above it to denote the changed sound value, similar to how the [[umlaut mark]] "<U+00A8>" is developed from a small "e" written above the letter in question. The letter "<U+00C5>" replaced "Aa" in 16th century in [[German alphabet|German]] and Swedish. However, "<U+00C5>" is no longer used in German.

== Nordic languages ==
The letter ''<U+00C5>'' in Nordic alphabets represents two sounds, a short and a long.
* The short version ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|/<U+0254>/}}) is similar in quality to, but shorter than, the vowel as pronounced in the words ''hall'' or ''dawn'' by speakers of [[Received Pronunciation]] and some conservative varieties of [[General American]].
* The long version ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|/o<U+02D0>/}}) is like the 'o' in ''bored.''
According to [[Historical-comparative linguistics|historical linguistics]] ''<U+00C5>-''sound has the same origin as the long {{IPA|/a<U+02D0>/}} sound in [[German language|German]] ''[[Aachen]]'' and ''Haar'' ([[Scandinavian language|Scandinavian]] ''h<U+00E5>r'', [[English language|English]] "hair").

The letter has been used in [[Scandinavian language]]s since [[Middle Ages|medieval]] times when the [[Runic alphabet|futhark]] was exchanged for the [[Latin alphabet]] and it is remnant of [[Odal rune|Odal-rune]]. In [[Old Norse]] the sound was written ''<U+00E1>''. Although it was abandoned in Danish and Norwegian owing to [[German (language)|German]] influence, it was retained in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. The letter ''<U+00C5>'' was re-introduced in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] in [[1917]] and in [[Danish language|Danish]] in [[1948]].

In Danish and Norwegian languages, "Aa" is considered equivalent to "<U+00C5>", inasmuch as "Aa" is the old symbol for ''<U+00C5>'', and a fully functional transcription for "<U+00C5>" when using a foreign typewriter.  In [[surname]]s, and occasionally in names of geographical places, the old symbol "Aa" is retained.  Correct alphabetisation in Danish and Norwegian places "Aa" along with "<U+00C5>" as the last letter in the alphabet. <U+00C5> is sometimes transliterated as <U+00C1> in the [[Faroese alphabet|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic alphabet]]s (usually in proper [[name]]s), even though <U+00C1> represents different [[diphthong]]s in their respective languages.

In the [[Swedish alphabet]], "<U+00C5>" is [[Collation|sorted]] immediately after "[[Z]]", as the third letter from the end. (The sequence after "Z" is "<U+00C5>, [[<U+00C4>]], [[<U+00D6>]]".) In the Finnish alphabet, "<U+00C5>" is treated as in Swedish, but its usage is limited to names of Swedish origin. In Norwegian and Danish, "Z" is followed by the sequence "[[<U+00C6>]], [[<U+00D8>]], <U+00C5>".

In the Norwegian, Danish and Swedish languages, ''<U+00E5>'' is also a word, meaning a rivulet, a stream or a small [[river]], like the rivers [[Aa River|Aa]], [[Au]] and [[Aue]] on the European continent. (See also [[Bourne Eau]].) In standard Norwegian and frequently in spoken Swedish it is also the mark for [[infinitive]]: ''<U+00E5> ta'' = "to take".

== Walloon writing ==
''<U+00C5>'' was introduced to some local variants of eastern-Walloon dialect at the beginning of the [[20th century]], initially to note the same sound as in Danish. Its use quickly spread to all the eastern-Walloon dialects, through the cultural influence of the city of [[Li<U+00E8>ge (city)|Li<U+00E8>ge]], and covered three different sounds, a long open ''o'', a long close ''o'', or a long ''a'', depending on the local varieties. The use of a single ''<U+00E5>'' letter to cover those different pronunciations has been embraced by the new pan-Walloon [[orthography]], that systemizes a unique orthography for words that are the same, regardless of the local phonetic variations.

In non-standardized writings outside the Li<U+00E8>ge area, words containing the ''<U+00E5>'' letter are written with ''au'', ''<U+00E2>'' or ''<U+00F4>'' depending on the pronunciation.
For example the word ''m<U+00E5>jhon'' (house) in standardized orthography is written ''m<U+00F4>jo'', ''m<U+00E2>hon'', ''mohone'', ''maujon'' in dialectal writings.

== Istro-Romanian writing ==

The [[Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian]] alphabet is based on the standard [[Romanian language|Romanian]] alphabet with three additional letters used to mark sounds specific only to this dialect '''<U+00E5>''', '''<U+013E>''' and '''<U+0144>'''. The third sound '''<U+00E5>''' is a uniquely IstroRomanian sound close to the English sound '''wa''' in water.

== Symbol for <U+00E5>ngstr<U+00F6>m ==
The letter "<U+00C5>" is also used throughout the world as the international symbol for the non-[[SI]] unit [[<U+00E5>ngstr<U+00F6>m]], a [[physical unit]] of [[length]] named after the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[physicist]] [[Anders Jonas <U+00C5>ngstr<U+00F6>m]]. It is always [[upper case]] in this context. Unicode also has encoded U+212B for the <U+00C5>ngstr<U+00F6>m symbol. However, that is canonically equivalent to the ordinary letter <U+00C5>. The duplicate encoding at U+212B is due to round-trip mapping compatibility with an East-Asian [[character encoding]], and should be seen as a mistake not to be used.

== On computers ==
[[Image:Illuminated keyboard 2.JPG|thumb|right|A Danish keyboard which features <U+00C6>, <U+00D8> and <U+00C5> keys.]]
For [[computer]]s, when using the [[ISO 8859-1]] or [[Unicode]] sets, the codes for "<U+00C5>" and "<U+00E5>" are respectively 197 and 229, or C5 and E5 in [[hexadecimal]].

In (X)[[HTML character entity reference]]s, required in cases where the letter is not available by ordinary coding, the codes are <code>&amp;Aring;</code> and <code>&amp;aring;</code>; or <code>&amp;#xC5;</code> and <code>&amp;#xE5;</code>,
which also can used in any XML application (when the letter is not directly available in the [[character encoding]] used).

On an [[X window system]] with [[Compose key]] enabled, press Compose and then ''aa'', or Compose and then ''a*''.

To type "<U+00E5>" with an US-International [[keyboard layout]] on [[Microsoft Windows]], hold the right-Alt and the "w" key, and the <U+00C5> in the same way with the addition of the [[Shift key]] . Or hold the [[Alt key]] and type 0197 or 143 on the [[numeric keypad]] for "<U+00C5>", and for "<U+00E5>" hold the Alt key and type 0229 or 134 on the numeric keypad.

To type "<U+00C5>" with an [[Apple Computer]] using a US keyboard layout,
hold the [[Option key]] and the [[Shift key]] simultaneously and type the A key. To type "<U+00E5>" with an Apple Computer, hold the [[Option key]] and type the A key.
