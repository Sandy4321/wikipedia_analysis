{{PoliticsUK}}
The '''Politics of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland''' takes place in the framework of a constitutional monarchy in which the [[British monarchy|Monarch]] is [[head of state]] and the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] of the [[United Kingdom]] is the [[head of government]]. It is a pluriform [[multi-party system]] with a partial [[devolution]] of power in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the [[government]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the two chambers of Parliament, the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature, though several [[Law Lord|senior judges]] are members of the [[House of Lords]], which is currently the highest court of the UK.

Since the 1920s, the two largest political parties in British politics have been the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. Though coalition and minority governments have been an occasional feature of [[Parliamentary]] politics, the [[Plurality electoral system|first-past-the-post]] electoral system used for [[Elections in the United Kingdom|general elections]] tends to maintain the dominance of these two parties, though each has in the past century relied upon a third party to deliver a working majority in Parliament.<ref name="BBC2005">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2005/past_elections/html/default.stm |title=General Election results through time, 1945<U+2013>2001 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2006-05-19}}</ref> 

The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], a party formed by the merger of the former [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] in 1988, is the third largest party in the British parliament. It seeks a reform of the electoral system to address the dominance of the two-party system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libdems.org.uk/media/documents/policies/22Constitution.pdf |title=Constitutional Reform |publisher=Liberal Democrats election change proposals |accessdate=2006-05-19}}</ref> Though 'nationalist' (as opposed to 'unionist') tendencies have shifted over time in Scotland and Wales, with [[Plaid Cymru]] (the Party of Wales) founded in 1925, the [[Scottish National Party]] in 1934, and [[Mebyon Kernow]] (the Party of Cornwall) in 1951, a serious political crisis threatening the integrity of the United Kingdom as a state has not occurred since the 1970s. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland each possess a legislature and government alongside that of the United Kingdom. However, this increased [[autonomous entity|autonomy]] and [[devolution]] of executive and legislative powers has not contributed to a reduction in support for independence from the United Kingdom, with the rise of new pro-independence parties. For example, the [[Scottish Green Party]] and the [[Scottish Socialist Party]] have gained popularity in recent years but have not significantly dented the parliamentary dominance of the three main parties.
The [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitution]] is uncodified, being made up of [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]s, [[statute]]s and other elements.

This system of government, known as the ''[[Westminster system]]'', has been adopted by other countries as well, such as [[Canada]], [[India]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Jamaica]], countries which make up part of the [[British Empire]].

==Monarch==
{{main|British monarchy}}

[[Image:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007 edit.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], the current monarch of the United Kingdom]]

The [[head of state]], ''theoretical'' and nominal source of [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[judiciary|judicial]] and [[legislature|legislative]] power in the UK is the [[British monarch]], currently Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]]. However, sovereignty in the UK no longer rests with the monarch, since the [[Bill of Rights 1689|English Bill of Rights in 1689]], which established the principle of [[Parliamentary sovereignty]]. Nonetheless, the monarch is still known as the Sovereign.

The British Sovereign possesses many hypothetical powers, including the right to choose any British citizen to be her [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and the right to call and dissolve [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] whenever she wishes. However, in accordance with the current uncodified constitution, the Prime Minister is the leader of the largest party in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], and Parliament is [[Dissolution of the United Kingdom Parliament|dissolved]] at the time suggested by the PM. The monarch retains the ability to deny giving a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] [[Royal Assent]], although in modern times this becomes increasingly more unlikely, as it would cause a constitutional crisis. [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] was the last monarch to exercise this power, which she did on [[11 March]] [[1708]] with regard to a bill "for the settling of Militia in [[Scotland]]". Other royal powers called [[royal prerogative]], such as patronage to appoint ministers and the ability to declare war, are exercised by the Prime Minister and the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]], with the formal consent of the Queen. 

Today the Sovereign has an essentially [[ceremonial]] role restricted in exercise of power by [[Convention (norm)|convention]] and [[public opinion]]. However the monarch does continue to exercise three essential rights: the ''right to be consulted, the right to advise and the right to warn''.<ref>As argued by the [[19th century]] British constitutional author [[Walter Bagehot]]</ref> As a consequence of these ideals, Prime Ministers hold weekly confidential meetings with the monarch in which the Sovereign holds the right to express her opinions. 

In formal terms, the ''Crown in Parliament'' is sovereign even though in practical terms the political head of the UK is the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] ([[Gordon Brown]] since [[27 June]] [[2007]]). However, the real powers of position of the Monarch in the British Constitution should not be downplayed. The monarch does indeed retain some power, but it has to be used with discretion. She fulfills the necessary constitutional role as head of state, and with the absence of a distinct separation of powers as in the American model and a strong second chamber, acts as a final check on executive power. If a time came to pass, for instance, when a law threatened the freedom or security of her [[British subject|subjects and citizens]], the Queen could decline royal assent, free as she is from the eddies of party politics. Furthermore, armed removal of her by Parliament or Government would be difficult, as the Monarch remains [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces, who swear an [[oath of allegiance]] to her.

==Executive==
{{main|Her Majesty's Government}}
{{seealso|Departments of the United Kingdom Government|List of British Governments}}

The [[Her Majesty's Government|Government]] performs the [[Executive (government)|Executive]] functions of the United Kingdom on behalf of the Sovereign, in whom executive power is theoretically and nominally vested. The monarch appoints a [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] as the head of Her Majesty's Government, guided by the strict convention that the Prime Minister should be the member of the House of Commons most likely to be able to form a Government with the support of the House.  In practice, this means that the leader of the [[political party]] with an absolute majority of seats in the House of Commons is chosen to be the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister then selects the other [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] which make up the Government and act as political heads of the various [[Ministry (government department)|Government Departments]]. About twenty of the most senior government ministers make up the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]].  In total, there are approximately 100 ministers that comprise the government.  In accordance with [[constitutional convention]], all ministers within the government are either [[Members of Parliament]] or [[peers]] in the [[House of Lords]].  

As in some other [[parliamentary system]]s of government (especially those based upon the [[Westminster System]]), the executive (called "the government") is drawn from and is answerable to Parliament - a successful [[Motion of No Confidence|vote of no confidence]] will force the government either to resign or to seek a [[Dissolution of parliament|parliamentary dissolution]] and a [[United Kingdom general elections|general election]]. In practice, members of parliament of all major parties are strictly controlled by [[Whip (politics)|whips]] who try to ensure they vote according to party policy. If the government has a large majority, then they are very unlikely to lose enough votes to be unable to pass legislation. 

In November 2005, the Blair government suffered its first defeat, on a [[Terrorism Act 2006|proposal]] to extend the period for detaining terrorist suspects to 90 days. Before this, the last bill proposed by a government that was defeated in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] was the [[Shop Hours Bill]] in 1986, one of only three in the 20th century. Governments with a small [[majority]], or [[coalition government]]s are much more vulnerable to defeat. They sometimes have to resort to extreme measures, such as "wheeling in" sick MPs, to get the necessary majority. [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1983 and [[Tony Blair]] in 1997 were swept into power with such large majorities that even allowing for dissent within their parties, they were assured of winning practically all parliamentary votes, and thus were able to implement radical programmes of legislative reform and innovation. But other Prime Ministers, such as [[John Major]] in 1992, who enjoy only slender majorities can easily lose votes if relatively small numbers of their [[backbencher|backbench]] MPs reject the whip and vote against the Government's proposals. As such, Governments with small majorities find it extremely difficult to implement controversial legislation and tend to become bogged down cutting deals with factions within their party or seeking assistance from other political parties.

===Government departments===
{{main|Departments of the United Kingdom Government}}
[[Image:HM Government Arms.png|thumb|left|200px|Arms of the British Government (a variation of the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Royal Arms]])]]

The Government of the United Kingdom contains a number of [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]] known mainly, though not exclusively as departments, e.g. [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. These are politically led by a [[Minister (government)|Government Minister]] who is often a [[Secretary of State]] and member of the [[Cabinet]]. He or she may also be supported by a number of junior Ministers.

Implementation of the Minister's decisions is carried out by a permanent politically neutral organization known as the [[civil service of the United Kingdom|civil service]]. Its constitutional role is to support the Government of the day regardless of which political party is in power. Unlike some other democracies, senior civil servants remain in post upon a change of Government. Administrative management of the Department is led by a head civil servant known in most Departments as a [[Permanent Secretary]]. The majority of the civil service staff in fact work in [[Executive agency|executive agencies]], which are separate operational organizations reporting to Departments of State. 

"Whitehall" is often used as a synonym for the central core of the Civil Service. This is because most Government Departments have headquarters in and around the former Royal Palace of [[Whitehall]].

==Legislature==

[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] is the centre of the political system in the United Kingdom. It is the supreme legislative body (i.e., there is [[parliamentary sovereignty]]), and Government is drawn from and answerable to it. Parliament is [[bicameral]], consisting of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords]].

===House of Commons===
[[Image:Palace of Westminster - Clock Tower and New Palace Yard from the west - 240404.jpg|thumbnail|right|Parliament meets at the [[Palace of Westminster]]]]
{{main|British House of Commons}}

The UK is divided into parliamentary [[Constituency|constituencies]] of broadly equal population (decided by the [[Boundary Commission]]), each of which elects a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) to the House of Commons. Of the 646 MPs there is currently only one who does not belong to a [[political party]]. In modern times, all Prime Ministers and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leaders of the Opposition]] have been drawn from the Commons, not the Lords. [[Alec Douglas-Home]] resigned from his peerages days after becoming Prime Minister in 1963, and the last Prime Minister before him from the Lords left in 1902 (the [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]]).

One party usually has a majority in Parliament, because of the use of the [[First Past the Post electoral system]], which has been conducive in creating the current [[two party system]]. The monarch normally asks a person commissioned to form a government simply whether it can ''survive'' in the House of Commons, something which majority governments are expected to be able to do. In exceptional circumstances the monarch asks someone to 'form a government' ''with a parliamentary minority''<ref>The formal request from the monarch is either to (a) form a government capable of ''surviving'' in the House of Commons (which by implication does not require a majority behind it, given that skilled minority governments can and do survive for long periods); or (b) form a government capable of ''commanding'' a majority in the Commons, which by implication requires a majority behind it</ref> which in the event of no party having a majority requires the formation of a [[coalition government]]. This option is only ever taken at a time of national emergency, such as war-time. It was given in 1916 to [[Andrew Bonar Law]], and when he declined, to [[David Lloyd George]]. It is worth noting that a government is not formed by a vote of the House of Commons, merely a commission from the monarch. The House of Commons gets its first chance to indicate confidence in the new government when it votes on the [[Speech from the Throne]] (the legislative programme proposed by the new government).

===House of Lords===
{{main|House of Lords}}

The [[House of Lords]] was previously a [[hereditary]], [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] chamber. Major reform has been partially completed and it is currently a mixture of hereditary members, [[bishop]]s of the [[Church of England]] known as [[Lords Spiritual]] and appointed members (life peers, with no hereditary right for their descendants to sit in the House). It currently acts to review legislation formed by the House of Commons, with the power to propose amendments, and exercises a [[suspensive veto]]. This allows it to delay legislation if it does not approve for twelve months. However, the use of vetoes is limited by convention and the operation of the [[Parliament Acts]]: the Lords may not veto the "money bills" or major manifesto promises (see [[Salisbury convention]]).  Persistent use of the veto can also be overturned by the [[Parliament Act]] by the Commons. Often governments will accept changes in legislation in order to avoid both the time delay, and the negative publicity of being seen to clash with the Lords. 

The House of Lords is currently also the final court of appeal within the United Kingdom, although in practice only a small subset of the House of Lords, known as the [[Law Lords]], hears judicial cases. In accordance with the legal doctrine of [[stare decisis]], the House of Lords supersedes all civil and criminal courts in England & Wales. However, the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] outlines plans for a [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] to replace the role of the Law Lords.

==Judiciary==
{{seealso|Courts of the United Kingdom|Law of the United Kingdom}}
The [[Lord Chancellor]] (prior to the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]]) was the head of the judiciary in [[England and Wales]]. He appointed [[judges]] and [[magistrates]] for criminal courts on behalf of the [[British monarchy|Sovereign]].  Since 2005, the [[Lord Chief Justice]] has assumed the role as head of the judicial branch of government. The Lord Chancellor fell into all the three branches of government, taking roles in the [[executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature]] and [[judiciary]], which is a peculiarity amongst many [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] in the world today. However, the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] removes much of the power in this role and gives it to others in the British government, mainly the newly created post of [[Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs]].  Another part of The Lord Chancellor's duties in the House of Lords has been replaced by a dedicated "Lord/[[Lord Speaker|Lady Speaker]]", who acts as a permanent [[presiding officer]] for the House of Lords.

The highest court of appeal within the UK at present is the [[House of Lords]].  In practice, only the [[Law Lords]] hear cases.  After 2009, the highest court of appeal will be a new dedicated [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]].

==Devolved powers==
{{update|date=May2007}}
In addition to the House of Commons, [[Scotland]] now has its own parliament and [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] have assemblies. 

The Scottish and Welsh devolved bodies are elected by [[Additional_Member_System|AMS]], and the Northern Ireland Assembly by [[Single_Transferable_Vote|STV]], both forms of [[proportional representation]]. The [[devolved government]]s have some legislative and other powers, but no ''right'' to exist.  [[De_jure|De jure]], they can have their powers broadened, narrowed or changed by an Act of the UK Parliament.

The UK is therefore a [[unitary state]] with a devolved system of government. This contrasts with a [[Federal republic|federal]] system, in which sub-parliaments or state parliaments and assemblies have a clearly defined constitutional ''right'' to exist and a ''right'' to exercise certain constitutionally guaranteed and defined functions and cannot be unilaterally abolished by Acts of the central parliament.

Tendencies to devolution with the wider United Kingdom have had only little resonance in England. There is little appetite for a [[devolved English parliament]], although senior Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have voiced concerns in regard to the [[West Lothian Question]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Jones |first=George |date=[[2006-01-17]] |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/01/17/nscot17.xml |title=Baker seeks end to West Lothian question |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=[[2006-03-10]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4792120.stm |title=No English parliament <U+2014> Falconer |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref> which is raised where certain policies for England are set by MPs from all four constituent nations whereas similar policies for Scotland or Wales might be decided in the devolved assemblies by legislators from those countries alone. Alternative proposals for English [[English regions|regional]] government have stalled, following a poorly received referendum on devolved government for the [[North East England|North East of England]], which had hitherto been considered the region most in favour of the idea, with the exception of [[Cornwall]], where there is widespread support for a [[Cornish Assembly]], including all five Cornish MPs.<ref>
[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1704112.stm BBC News 2001 - Blair gets Cornish assembly call]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2810789.stm BBC news 2003 - Prescott pressed on Cornish Assembly poll]</ref> England is therefore governed according to the balance of parties across the whole of the United Kingdom.

The resurgence in [[Modern Celts|Celtic]] language and identity, as well as 'regional' politics and development, has contributed to forces pulling against the unity of the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manxman.co.im/cleague/ |title=The Celtic League |accessdate=2006-05-20}}</ref> This was clearly demonstrated when- although some argue it was influenced by general public dillusionment with Labour- the [[Scottish National Party]] became the largest party in the Scottish Parliament by one seat. Alex Salmond (leader of SNP) has since made history by becoming the first First Minister of Scotland from a party other than Labour. The SNP rule as a minority government at Holyrood. Nevertheless, recent opinion polls have suggested that nationalism (i.e. a desire to break up the UK) is rising within Scotland and England. However, the polls have been known to be inaccurate in the past (for example, in the run up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 General Election]]). Moreover, polls carried out in the 1970s and the 1990s showed similar results, only to be debunked at elections. While support for breaking up the UK was strongest in Scotland, there was still a clear lead for unionism over nationalism.<ref>{{cite news |title=Welsh firmly back Britain's Union |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6263807.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=[[2007-01-16]] |accessdate=2007-02-05}}</ref> In Northern Ireland, there has been a significant decrease in violence over the last twenty years, though the situation remains tense, with the more hard-line parties such as [[Sinn F<U+00E9>in]] and the [[Democratic Unionist]]s now holding the most parliamentary seats (see [[Demographics and politics of Northern Ireland]]).

===England===
{{main|Politics of England}}
The government has no plans to establish an English parliament or assembly although several pressure groups<ref>including [http://www.thecep.org.uk/ The Campaign for an English Parliament]</ref> are calling for one. One of their main arguments is that MPs (and thus voters) from different parts of the UK have inconsistent powers. Currently an MP from Scotland can vote on legislation which affects only England but MPs from England (or indeed Scotland) cannot vote on matters devolved to the Scottish parliament. Indeed, the current [[Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]], who is an MP for a Scottish constituency, introduces some laws that only affect England and not his own constituency. This anomaly is known as the [[West Lothian question]].

The policy of the UK Government in England was to establish elected [[Regional Assemblies in England|regional assemblies]] with no legislative powers. The [[London Assembly]] was the first of these, established in 2000, following a [[London referendum, 1998|referendum]] in 1998, but further plans were abandoned following rejection of a proposal for an elected assembly in [[North East England]] in a [[Northern England referendums, 2004|referendum]] in 2004. Unelected regional assemblies remain in place in eight [[regions of England]].

===Northern Ireland===
{{main|Politics of Northern Ireland}}
The current government of Northern Ireland was established as a result of the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]]. This created the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]. The Assembly is a [[unicameral]] body consisting of 108 members elected under the [[Single Transferable Vote]] form of [[proportional representation]]. The Assembly is based on the principle of power-sharing, in order to ensure that both communities in Northern Ireland, [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionist]] and [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]], participate in governing the region. It has power to legislate in a wide range of areas and to elect the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] (cabinet). It sits at [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Parliament Buildings]] at Stormont in [[Belfast]]. 

The Assembly has authority to legislate in a field of competences known as "transferred matters". These matters are not explicitly enumerated in the Northern Ireland Act 1998 but instead include any competence not explicitly retained by the Parliament at Westminster. Powers reserved by Westminster are divided into "excepted matters", which it retains indefinitely, and "reserved matters", which may be transferred to the competence of the Northern Ireland Assembly at a future date. Health and education are "transferred" but criminal law and police are "reserved" and royal succession, defence and international relations are all "excepted".

While the Assembly was in suspension, due to scandals involving the main parties and the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), its legislative powers were exercised by the UK government, which effectively had power to legislate by decree. Laws that would normally be within the competence of the Assembly were passed by the UK government in the form of [[Order in Council|Orders-in-Council]] rather than legislative acts.

===Scotland===
{{main|Politics of Scotland}}
[[Image:Scotparialmentinside.jpg|thumb|200px|The debating chamber of the [[Scottish Parliament]].]]
The current [[Scottish Parliament]] was established by the [[Scotland Act 1998]] and its first meeting as a [[devolved]] legislature was on [[12 May]] [[1999]]. The parliament has the power to pass laws and has limited tax-varying capability. Another of its jobs is to hold the [[Scottish Government]] to account. The "devolved matters" over which it has responsibility include [[Education in Scotland|education]], [[Health in Scotland|health]], agriculture, and [[Scots law|justice]]. A degree of domestic authority, and all foreign policy, remains with the UK Parliament in [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]].

The public take part in Parliament in a way that is not the case at Westminster through Cross Party Groups on policy topics which the interested public join and attend meetings of alongside [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Members of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSPs).

===Wales===
{{main|Politics of Wales}}
[[Image:Senedd.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The Welsh Assembly Building]]
The [[National Assembly for Wales]] is a [[devolved]] [[National Assembly|assembly]] with power to make legislation in [[Wales]], and is also responsible for [[Welsh Assembly Government]] departments in Wales. The Assembly was formed under the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]], by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government, after a [[Wales referendum 1997|referendum]] in 1997 (also supported by [[Plaid Cymru]] and the [[Liberal Democrats]]) approved its creation.

There is now a legal separation of the legislative and executive functions of the National Assembly, since the passing of the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]]. The Act created a separate executive called the "[[Welsh Assembly Government]]" which performs the day to day running of government affairs and contains members of the highest elected party of the Assembly chamber. The act also made the National Assembly for Wales a separate entity from the Welsh Assembly Government, and this entity scrutinizes the government in power. The "[[Assembly Commission]]" was also created to ensure the smooth running of resources and gathering of accurate facts for the Assembly to deal with.


As of the passing of the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]], the National Assembly for Wales now has it's own legislative powers known as [[Assembly Measures]]. Each Assembly Measure derives it's power from a [[Legislative Competency Order]] which has to be passed by the Assembly and two [[Houses of Parliament]]. Before the 2006 Act, the Assembly did not have such legislative power and only had the right to develop Subordinate legislation off primary legislation made by the UK Parliament.

==Elections and parties==
{{main|Elections in the United Kingdom}}

Unlike many [[Europe]]an nations, the United Kingdom uses a [[first-past-the-post]] system to elect members of Parliament. Therefore, elections and political parties in the United Kingdom are affected by [[Duverger's Law]], which causes the agglomeration of related political ideologies into a few large parties with many small parties rarely winning representation. 

Historically, the United Kingdom had two major political parties, though currently three parties dominate the political landscape. Originally, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] dominated British politics, but the Liberal Party collapsed in the early twentieth century and was largely replaced by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. In the 1980s, the Liberals merged with the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] and have recently experienced a resurgence as the [[Liberal Democrats]], enough so to again be considered a major party. In addition to the three major parties, many minor parties contest elections. Of these, few except for regional parties such as the [[Scottish National Party]] and [[Democratic Unionist Party]] win seats in Parliament.

In the most recent [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|general election in 2005]], the Labour Party won re-election on a reduced majority, with both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats making gains at the expense of Labour.

===Electoral systems===
Various electoral systems are used in the UK:

*The [[First Past the Post electoral system|First Past the Post]] system is used for [[United Kingdom general elections|general elections]], and also for some [[Local Government in the United Kingdom|local government]] elections in England and Wales (previously in Scotland).
*The [[Bloc vote|Bloc Vote]] system is also used for some [[Local Government in the United Kingdom|local government]] elections in England and Wales (previously in Scotland).
*[[Mixed member proportional representation|Additional member systems]] have been in use, since [[devolution]] in 1999, for the [[Scottish Parliament]], [[Welsh Assembly]] and [[London Assembly]]. 
*The [[Single Transferable Vote]] system is used to elect the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], Northern Ireland's local councils, and Northern Ireland's members of the European Parliament. Scottish local councils started using the STV system in 2007.
*The [[Party-list proportional representation|party list]] is used for [[European Parliament]] elections in Great Britain (but not Northern Ireland).
*The [[Supplementary Vote]] is used to elect [[Mayors in the United Kingdom|directly-elected mayors]], such as the [[Mayor of London]].

In the last few general elections, voter mandates for Westminster in the 40% ranges have been swung into 60% parliamentary majorities. No government has won a majority of the popular vote since the [[UK National Government|National Government]] of [[Stanley Baldwin]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935]]. Twice since [[World War II]] (in [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1951]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1974 (February)|February 1974]]) the party with fewer popular votes actually came out with the larger number of seats. One reason for all the quirks is that Britain has many political parties, making it possible to win individual constituencies on less than 50% of the vote due to the opposition votes being divided. 

[[Electoral reform]] has been considered for [[United Kingdom general elections|general elections]] many times, but after the [[Jenkins Commission (UK)|Jenkins Commission]] report in October 1998, which suggested the [[Alternative vote top-up]] for [[United Kingdom general elections|general elections]] was effectively ignored by the government, there have been no further government proposals for reform. It is highly unlikely that electoral reform will happen unless there is a significant change in the balance of power and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] loses its large majority.

Low turnout is a concern, as the percentage of the electorate who voted in the [[united Kingdom general election, 2005|last general election]] was just 61%.

===History of political parties===
{{splitsection}}
UK political parties originated in 1662 in the aftermath of the [[English Civil War#Aftermath|English Civil War]], with the creation of the Court Party and the Country Party.

== Conservatives (Tories) ==

The Country Party soon became known as the [[Tory|Tories]] (now the Conservative party, still commonly referred to as "the Tories") and the [[Whig Party (UK)|Whigs]]. The two remained the main political parties until the 20th century.

The term "Tory" originates from the Exclusion Bill crisis of 1678-1681 - the Whigs were those who supported the exclusion of the Roman Catholic [[James II of England|Duke of York]] from the thrones of England, Ireland and Scotland, and the Tories were those who opposed it. Both names were originally insults: a "whiggamor" was a cattle driver, and a "tory" was an [[Irish language|Irish]] term for an outlaw. 

Generally, the Tories were associated with lesser gentry and the Church of England, while Whigs were more associated with trade, money, larger land holders (or "land magnates"), expansion and tolerance. Both were still committed to the political system in place at that time. Neither group could be considered a true political party in the modern sense.

The Rochdale [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]] were a group of more extreme reformists who were also heavily involved in the [[cooperative movement]]. They sought to bring about a more equal society, and are considered by modern standards to be left-wing.
[[Image:Peelpic1.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Robert Peel]]]]
After becoming associated with repression of popular discontent in the years after 1815, the Tories underwent a fundamental transformation under the influence of [[Robert Peel]], himself an industrialist rather than a landowner, who in his [[1834]] "[[Tamworth Manifesto]]" outlined a new "Conservative" philosophy of reforming ills while conserving the good.

Though Peel's supporters subsequently split from their colleagues over the issue of free trade in 1846, ultimately joining the Whigs and the [[Radical Party (UK)|Radicals]] to form what would become the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], Peel's version of the party's underlying outlook was retained by the remaining Tories, who adopted his label of Conservative as the official name of their party.

The term '[[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]' was first used officially in 1868, though it had been in use colloquially for decades beforehand. The Liberal Party formed a government in 1870 and then alternated with the Conservative Party as the party of government throughout the late 19th century and early 20th century.

The [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] was set up to replace the [[Home Rule League]] in 1882. It remained the third-largest party in British politics until 1918, often holding the [[balance of power (politics)|balance of power]].

== Labour ==

In 1900, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Representation Committee]] was established and it changed its name to '''The Labour Party''' in 1906. After the [[World War I|First World War]], this led to the demise of the Liberal Party as the main reformist force in British politics. The existence of the Labour Party on the left of British politics led to a slow waning of energy from the Liberal Party, which has consequently assumed third place in national politics. After performing poorly in the elections of 1922, 1923 and 1924, the Liberal Party was superseded by the Labour Party as the party of the left.

== History ==

Following two brief spells in minority governments in 1924 and 1929-1931, the Labour Party had its first true victory after [[World War II]] in the [[1945]] "[[United Kingdom general election, 1945|khaki election]]". Throughout the rest of the twentieth century, Labour governments alternated with Conservative governments. The Conservatives were in power for most of the time, with the Labour Party suffering the "wilderness years" of 1951-1964 (three straight General Election defeats) and 1979-1997 (four straight General Election defeats).

During this second period, [[Margaret Thatcher]], who became leader of the Conservative party in 1975, made a fundamental change to Conservative policies, turning the Conservative Party into an economic neoliberal party. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|General Election of 1979]] she defeated [[James Callaghan]]'s troubled Labour government after the [[Winter of Discontent|winter of discontent]].

For most of the 1980s and the 1990s under her successor [[John Major]], Conservative governments pursued policies of [[privatization]], anti-[[Trade Union|trade-union]]ism, and, for a time, [[Monetarism]], now known collectively as [[Thatcherism]].

The Labour Party elected left-winger [[Michael Foot]] as their leader after their 1979 election defeat, and he responded to dissatisfaction with the Labour Party by pursuing a number of radical policies developed by its grass-roots members. In 1981 several right-wing Labour MPs formed a breakaway group called the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP), a move which split Labour and is widely believed to have made Labour unelectable for a decade. The SDP formed an alliance with the Liberal Party which contested the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987]] general elections as a centrist alternative to Labour and the Conservatives. After some initial success, the SDP did not prosper (partly due to its unfavourable distribution of votes in the FPTP electoral system), and was accused by some of splitting the anti-Conservative vote.

The SDP eventually merged with the Liberal Party to form the Liberal Democrats in 1988. Support for the new party has increased since then, and the Liberal Democrats (often referred to as LibDems) in 1997 and 2001 gained an increased number of seats in the House of Commons.

The Labour Party was badly defeated in the Conservative landslide of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], and Michael Foot was replaced shortly thereafter by [[Neil Kinnock]] as leader. Kinnock expelled the [[far left]] [[Militant tendency]] group and moderated many of the party's policies. Yet he was in turn replaced by [[John Smith (UK politician)|John Smith]] after Labour defeats in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1987]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992]] general elections. 

[[Tony Blair]] became leader of the Labour party after John Smith's sudden death from a heart attack in 1994. He continued to move the Labour Party back towards the 'centre' by loosening links with the [[trade union|union]]s and embracing many of Margaret Thatcher's liberal economic policies. This, coupled with the [[profession]]alising of the party machine's approach to the media, helped Labour win a historic landslide in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 General Election]], after 18 years of Conservative governent. Some observers say the Labour Party had by then morphed from a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party to a [[social democracy|social democratic]] party, a process which delivered three general election victories but alienated some of its core base.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

====Main political parties====
*[[British Whig Party|Whigs]]
*[[Tories]]
*[[Radical Party (UK)]]
*[[Conservative Party (UK)]]
*[[Liberal Party (UK)]]
*[[Irish Parliamentary Party]]
*[[Labour Party (UK)]]
*[[Social Democratic Party (UK)]]
*[[Liberal Democrats]]

===Current political landscape===
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 General Election]], [[Tony Blair]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] won an unprecedented (for Labour) third consecutive term, albeit with a reduced majority.

After the Labour victory senior Conservative figures indicated that their party needed to change both its outlook and, perhaps more importantly, its image.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} The Conservative Party's legacy of its difficulties in the early- and mid-1990s appeared to have alienated many middle-class voters, and its aging membership (average age 65) also posed problems. 

Leader [[Michael Howard]] tendered his resignation soon after the election, and his resigning was followed by a review of the leadership election rules and the leadership campaign. The campaign culminated with speeches by the two lead candidates, David Davis and David Cameron, at the 2005 party conference. Following his well received speech [[David Cameron]] was elected by the party membership with large majority of votes cast.

The Conservatives under David Cameron have seen their popularity grow, as shown by their success at the Local Elections in May 2006 and May 2007 and opinion polls which have largely, but not always, shown a small lead over Labour since early 2006.[http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/index.php] These poll leads are their first since the early 1990s.

Conversely, since the 2005 election the Labour Government has suffered from internal power-struggles over when Tony Blair would step down as Prime Minister and party leader, as well as the on-going issue of Iraq. Individual Labour government departments have also come under increasing criticism, especially the [[Home Office]], which is in charge of U.K prisons, as well as the country's immigration and asylum policies. In June 2007 [[Gordon Brown]] took over from Tony Blair as leader of the Labour party.

Major national issues in current British national politics, in descending order of voter concern (as of MORI poll September 2006), are:

* Race relations / [[Immigration to the United Kingdom|immigration]]
* [[Defense (military)|Defence]] / [[Terrorism]]
* [[English law|Law]] and [[British Police|order]]
* The [[National Health Service]] (NHS)
* [[Education in the United Kingdom|Education]]
* [[Pollution]] and the [[Natural environment|environment]]
* The state of the [[Economy of the United Kingdom|economy]]
* [[house|Housing]] and house prices
* [[Pensions]] and [[Welfare state|benefits]]
* [[Taxation]]

There are also specific regional issues, not listed above.

===Minor parties===
====Small parties====
The [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect]] party, a [[left-wing]] group that came out of the [[anti-war movement]] has one MP, [[George Galloway]], and a small number of seats on local councils across the country.

====Non-Parliamentary political parties====
Two parties have no seats in Parliament, but multiple seats in the [[European Parliament]] and a number of seats on local councils.

*[[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]]
*[[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP)

The Greens also have two seats in the [[London Assembly]]; UKIP elected two members to the London Assembly, but they subsequently quit the party and now sit as [[One London]] members. [[Veritas (political party)|Veritas]] has one [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP), its founder and former leader [[Robert Kilroy Silk]], though he was elected for UKIP (which he later left). The [[Scottish National Party]] has formed a [[minority government]] in the Scottish Parliament, and [[Plaid Cymru]] have seats in the Welsh Assembly, as well as each having a number of council seats. A number of other parties have local councillors including the [[British National Party]] (BNP), the [[Liberal Party (UK, 1989)|Liberal Party]] (in Liverpool, Peterborough and elsewhere), [[Mebyon Kernow]] (Cornish nationalist party) in Cornwall, and the Communist [[Left Alliance (Scotland)|Left Alliance]] (in Fife).

====Regional parties====
Other political parties contest elections in [[constituent parts]] of the United Kingdom, seeking [[autonomy]] or [[Sovereignty|independence]], for example:

* [[Mebyon Kernow]] (''Sons of [[Cornwall]]'')
* [[Plaid Cymru - Party of Wales]]
* [[Scottish Green Party]]
* [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP, advocating independent [[Scottish statehood]] within the [[European Union]])
* [[Scottish Socialist Party]] (campaigning for a socialist Scottish [[republic]])
* [[English Democrats]] (campaigners for a separate English Parliament)

The SNP and Plaid Cymru work as a single parliamentary group in the UK and European parliaments.

Several local parties contest only within a specific area, a single county, borough or district. Examples include the [[Better Bedford Independent Party]], one of the dominant parties in [[Bedford Borough Council]], led by Bedford's current Mayor, [[Frank Branston]]. The most notable local party is [[Health Concern]], which controls a single seat in the UK Parliament.

====The far-left and far-right====
Other [[list of political parties in the United Kingdom|minor UK political parties]] exist, but generally do not succeed in returning MPs to Parliament. There is a tendency on the far left and right for a proliferation of tiny groups (also known by the French term '[[groupuscule]]s'), sometimes characterized by extremely rigid ideologies or built around personalities. The largest of these groups probably is the [[Socialist Workers Party]] with a few thousand members.

====Independents====
There are also a few independent politicians with no party allegiance. This normally occurs only when an MP decides to break with his party in mid-session. Since 1950 only two MPs have been elected as genuine independents, though others have been elected after breaking away from their party:
*[[Martin Bell]] represented the [[Tatton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tatton]] constituency in [[Cheshire]] between 1997 and 2001. He was elected following a "sleaze" scandal involving the sitting Conservative MP, [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] -- Bell, a [[BBC]] journalist, stood as an anticorruption independent candidate, and the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties withdrew their candidates from the election.
*Dr. [[Richard Taylor (UK politician)|Richard Taylor]] MP was elected for the [[Wyre Forest (UK Parliament constituency)|Wyre Forest]] constituency in the 2001 on a platform opposing the closure of Kidderminster hospital. He later established [[Health Concern]], the party under which he ran in 2005.

==Local Government==
{{main|Local Government in the United Kingdom}}

The UK is divided into a variety of different types of [[Local authority|Local Authorities]], with different functions and responsibilities, which are further subdivided in rural areas and some urban areas into [[Civil parish|parishes]].  

Local Authorities are responsible for such matters as administering education, public transport, and the management of public spaces. Local authorities are often engaged in [[community politics]].

Parishes have councils too and some are known as city or town councils. These councils are either made up of elected parish councilors, or in very small parishes, they use [[direct democracy]].

There are two common systems of local government in the UK: the old-style two-tier and newer single-tier system. The older (and far more complex) two-tier system consists of [[Non-metropolitan district|District Councils]] and [[County Council]]s. The District Councils are responsible for rubbish collection, granting planning permission and council housing. County Councils are  responsible for education, social services, welfare, some public transport and other local functions. 

[[Unitary Authority|Unitary Authorities]], which are in use throughout the whole of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and in some areas in England, have a single tier of local government, and combine District and County Council functions into one body. 

In [[Greater London]], a unique two-tier system exists, with power shared between the [[London borough]] councils, and the [[Greater London Authority]] which is headed by an [[Mayor of London|elected mayor]].

Unitary authorities often share common public safety authorities with other neighboring councils. For example, [[Luton]] shares services with Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire and [[Milton Keynes (borough)]] shares services with Buckinghamshire.

==European Union==
The United Kingdom is a member of the [[European Union]] (EU). As such, UK citizens elect [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] to represent them in the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]] and [[Strasbourg]]. The UK elects 78 MEPs.

In recent years, there have been divisions in both major parties as to whether the UK should form greater ties within the EU, leave things as they are, or reduce the EU's supranational powers. Opponents of greater European integration are known as [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s, supporters Europhiles. Divisions over Europe run deep in both major parties, and though the Conservative Party is seen to split over this issue, whilst in Government up to 1997 and today in opposition. The Labour Party also faces conflicting views within Cabinet over UK adoption of the [[euro]], and whether to ratify the new [[European Constitution]] (for which see [[United Kingdom Reform Treaty referendum]]).

[[British nationalism|British nationalists]] have long campaigned against EU integration. The strong showing of the eurosceptic United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) in the [[European Parliament Election 2004|2004 European Parliament elections]] has shifted the debate over UK relations with the EU.
