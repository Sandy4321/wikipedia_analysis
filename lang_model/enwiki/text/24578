The '''Battle of Suoi Chau Pha''' was fought on 6 August 1967 during the [[Vietnam War]] between Australian troops and the [[Viet Cong]]. The battle took place during ''Operation Ballarat'', an Australian search and destroy operation in the eastern Hat Dich area, north-west of [[Nui Dat]] in [[Phuoc Tuy Province|Phuoc Tuy province]]. Following a covert insertion the day before which had caught a number of Viet Cong sentries by surprise, [[7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|A Company, 7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] had patrolled forward unaware of the presence of a large Viet Cong main force unit nearby. Clashing with a reinforced company from ''3 Battalion, 274 Regiment'', a classic encounter battle ensued between two forces of roughly equal size. Fought at close quarters in dense jungle amid a heavy monsoon rain, both sides suffered heavy casualties as neither was able to gain an advantage. Finally after a lengthy battle lasting several hours, the Australian artillery proved decisive and the communists were forced to withdraw, dragging many of their dead from the battlefield having suffered crippling casualties.

==Background==
By the second half of 1967 the Viet Cong seemed to have melted away in [[Phuoc Tuy Province|Phuoc Tuy province]], abandoning many of their bunker systems and avoiding the main roads and towns. The [[Battle of Long Tan]] and [[Operation Bribie]] had weakened the communist forces in the province, while further operations had restricted their movement and logistics. This prompted the new commander of the [[1st Australian Task Force]] (1ATF)<U+2014>Brigadier Stuart Graham<U+2014>to speculate that the Viet Cong may have fled to the border, perhaps leaving the province altogether.<ref name=Ham315>{{harvnb|Ham|2007|p=315}}.</ref><ref group="Note"> Viet Cong units normally operating in the province included Main Forces from the ''5th Division'', under the command of Senior Colonel Nguyen The Truyen, consisting of ''274 Regiment'' and ''275 Regiment'', each of three infantry battalions, supported by a number of artillery, engineer, medical and logistic units. Group 89 (Artillery) was equipped with recoilless rifles, medium mortars and heavy machine guns. Local Forces included ''D445 Battalion'', a provincial unit normally operating in the south of the province and in Long Khanh, while guerrilla forces included two companies in the Chau Duc district, one in Long Dat and a platoon in Xuyen Moc; in total around 4,500 men. See {{harvnb|MacGarrigle|1998|p=380}} and {{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|pp=44<U+2013>49}}.</ref> A succession of operations in the south-east of the province and the completion of the [[minefield|barrier minefield]] at [[Dat Do]] meant that no single, sizable threat remained to the populated areas of Phuoc Tuy. ''D445 Battalion'' had suffered heavy casualties and posed a diminished threat, while the headquarters of the Viet Cong ''5th Division'' was located near the northern border, west of the May Tao mountains and its fighting formations were widely dispersed. ''275 Regiment'' was reported to have moved north to [[War Zone D]] for retraining and refitting, while ''274 Regiment'' had eventually moved from its scattered locations in the north-west Hat Dich area to replace ''275 Regiment'' in the north-east of the province and was now operating in unfamiliar terrain. Meanwhile casualties, illness and poor local recruitment meant that the Viet Cong were now largely reliant on reinforcements from North Vietnam.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|p=187}}.</ref> Such an assessment may have been overly optimistic however, and rather than having left Phuoc Tuy the communists were more likely reinforcing and consolidating in preparation for future operations, avoiding battle with the Australians in order to preserve their strength.<ref name=Ham315/>

Based at based at [[Nui Dat]] in the [[III Corps (South Vietnam)|III Corps Tactical Zone]], 1ATF now included two infantry battalions plus armour, aviation, engineers and artillery support, with total Australian troop strength in Vietnam now reaching 6,300 men.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|p=26}}.</ref> [[5th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|5RAR]] and [[6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment |6RAR]] returned to Australia in May and June 1967 and were replaced by [[2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment |2RAR]] and [[7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment |7RAR]].<ref name=Kuring330>{{harvnb|Kuring|2004|p=330}}.</ref> While the war had become a series of big unit search-and-destroy operations in an a war of [[attrition]] for the Americans, the Australians had continued to operate independently within Phuoc Tuy province, pursuing their own [[counter-insurgency]] campaign.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|p=35}}.</ref> Differences of opinion between Australian and American methods had produced friction between the allies however, and, increasingly impatient with the Australian approach, the American commander, [[General (United States)|General]] [[William Westmoreland]], had subsequently complained to the Commander Australian Forces Vietnam, Major General Tim Vincent in early-1967, demanding a more aggressive approach. Convinced that deliberate patrolling techniques were more effective in separating communist forces from the population in the villages while working towards slowly extending government control, such urgings went largely unheeded however.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|p=89 and 196}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ham|2007|p=317}}.</ref>

The highway to Xuyen Moc in the east had been reopened by the Australians in March&nbsp;<U+2013> April, and with ''275 Regiment'' believed to have been severely weakened following Long Tan, a series of operations aimed at destroying ''274 Regiment'' were subsequently launched by 1ATF.<ref name=Ham315/><ref group="Note">Australian assessments of ''275 Regiment'' were reinforced by its unsuccessful attempt to ambush a convoy from US [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (United States)|11th Armoured Cavalry Regiment]] (11ACR) on 2 December 1966, see {{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|p=48}}.</ref> After Westmoreland had again pressed Vincent on what he saw as the limited results achieved by Australian tactics, a large joint US-Australian operation was mounted against the May Tao mountains in Phuoc Tuy, moving against the communist bases in the area.<ref name=Ham315/> The largest search and destroy operation mounted by the Australians to that point, ''Operation Paddington'' (9<U+2013>15 July) was carried out in co-operation with American and [[ARVN|South Vietnamese]] units based in Bien Hoa province, and targeted the Viet Cong ''5th Division''. Mounted on a large scale under American command and involving nearly 15,000 troops, Paddington failed to result in significant contact, in spite of the employment of well co-ordinated search techniques and blocking forces. A large number of Viet Cong camps, bunkers and storage areas were however uncovered and destroyed, resulting in significant disruption to the communist logistic system.<ref name=Kuring330/> The results were disappointing nonetheless, and the communists continued to allude the Australians.<ref name=Ham315/><ref group="Note">Under the overall command of Major General George G. O'Connor, commander [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|US 9th Infantry Division]], allied forces for ''Operation Paddington'' included US 1st Brigade, 9th Infantry Division, 2nd Battalion, US 47th Infantry Regiment (Mechanised), US 11th Armoured Cavalry Regiment, Task Force B Marine Corps (RVN) and 1st Australian Task Force, as well as various supporting arms including two artillery batteries and more than a thousand armoured vehicles and helicopters. Viet Cong casualties included 92 killed, including 31 by 1ATF for the loss of one Australian killed and another wounded, see {{harvnb|Ham|2007|p=317}} and {{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|p=435}}.</ref>

Unsure of the next move however, the Viet Cong ''5th Division'' adopted a cautious posture, with only the ''1st Battalion, 275 Regiment'' remaining in the May Tao mountains while ''274 Regiment'' dispersed east of Route 2 for the remainder of the month.<ref>{{harvnb|MacGarrigle|1998|p=380}}.</ref> The province now seemed secure and Graham saw the opportunity to continue pacification on a more methodical basis in Phuoc Tuy.<ref name=Ham317_318>{{harvnb|Ham|2007|pp=317<U+2013>318}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|p=209}}.</ref> Planning to attack the remaining Viet Cong where they were most vulnerable, the Australians returned to interdicting communist supply lines and bases, with 2RAR conducting two search-and-destroy operations to the east of Dat Do<U+2014>''Operation Cairns'' in late-July followed by ''Operation Atherton'' in mid-August, both of which resulted in only minor contact.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|p=210}}.</ref>

==Prelude==
The Hat Dich area had been quiet since US forces had swept of the area in June as part of ''Operation Akron'' (9<U+2013>29 June), and Australian intelligence assessed that it was free of Viet Cong main force combat units.<ref group="Note">''Operation Akron'' had preceded ''Operation Paddington'' with US 1st Brigade, 9th Infantry Division clearing the Hat Dich itself, driving east from Highway 15 with engineers in support, while 11ACR worked with a South Vietnamese ranger battalion in the eastern Hat Dich. Largely successful for the Americans, it resulted in Viet Cong losses of 80 killed or captured, see {{harvnb|MacGarrigle|1998|pp=379<U+2013>383}}.</ref> By late-July communist rear services units and other supporting units were believed to have begun moving back into the area however, in an attempt to rehabilitate their base areas that had been destroyed in the earlier fighting.<ref name=McNeill211>{{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|p=211}}.</ref> Yet in reality the location of communist forces was largely unknown to the Australians. In mid-July, ''274 Regiment''<U+2014>now believed to be commanded by Ut Thoi<U+2014>had been forced to move from the Hat Dich towards its north-eastern base areas due to ''Operation Paddington'' and Australian [[signals intelligence]] had effectively tracking the regiment's movement.<ref group="Note">According to another source ''274 Regiment'' may have been commanded Nguyen Duong, see {{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|p=48}}.</ref> However, 1ATF intelligence officers had then lost track of the unit.<ref name=McNeill215>{{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|p=215}}.</ref>
	
''Operation Ballarat'' would assess the extent of the Viet Cong's efforts to re-establish their supply lines and to repair bunkers and camps in the eastern Hat Dich that had been destroyed by recent operations.<ref name=McNeill211/> The [[concept of operations]] envisioned 7RAR, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Eric Smith, creating a series of company patrol bases, from which [[platoon]] fighting patrols would gather intelligence on Viet Cong activities. An ambush plan would then be developed.<ref name=McNeill211/> The twelve day battalion search and destroy operation subsequently commenced on 4 August 1967, within AO Lion, {{convert|9|km|mi}} north-west of Nui Dat. In an attempt to achieve surprise the rifle companies moved into their respective areas of operation, rather than by helicopter, carrying five days rations and supplies to reduce the need for resupply and the likelihood of detection by the Viet Cong.<ref name=Kuring330/> With stealth considered key to the operation it was intended that any bunkers and camps located during the patrol phase of the operation would not be destroyed until after the ambush phase. Regardless, the Australians expected only to encounter rear guard elements.<ref name=McNeill211/>

Fire Support Base Giraffe was subsequently established with the {{convert|105|mm|in|adj=on}} [[M2A2 Howitzer]]s of 106 Field Battery and {{convert|81|mm|in|adj=on}} mortars from Mortar Platoon, 7RAR providing indirect fire support, while elements of the ''Australian Reinforcement Holding Unit'' provided protection.<ref name=Kuring330/> Further support was provide by {{convert|155|mm|in|adj=on}} medium guns from the American 2/35th Artillery Battalion, while American {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} and {{convert|175|mm|in|adj=on}} heavy artillery were also available if required.<ref name=McNeill214>{{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|p=214}}.</ref> Meanwhile, elements of 1 Field Squadron, Royal Australian Engineers had been tasked with clearing Route 2 of vegetation and rubber north of Nui Dat and D Company, 2RAR was attached for the operation, providing security for the engineers and additional protection to the fire support base in conjunction with a troop of [[M113 armoured personnel carrier]]s from [[3rd Cavalry Regiment (Australia)|A Squadron, 3rd Cavalry Regiment]] which would support the infantry during the day.<ref>{{harvnb|Newman|1995|p=14}}.</ref><ref group="Note">V Company, 2RAR later relieved D Company in support of ''Operation Ballarat'', see {{harvnb|Newman|1995|p=14}}.</ref>

==Battle==
A Company, 7RAR had already been patrolling in the Hat Dich since 3 August when the orders for the operation were issued, and they were subsequently re-supplied by helicopter early on the evening of 5 August with the supplies successfully unloaded and the helicopters departed within three minutes utilising an insertion technique perfected by the [[Special Air Service Regiment]].<ref name=McNeill211/> The covert infiltration of the infantry companies went undetected, and on the morning of 6 August A Company began to patrol towards the intended site of their initial patrol base. Under the command of Major Ewart O'Donnell, by-mid morning the Australians were approximately {{convert|10|km|mi}} east of [[Ph<U+00FA> M<U+1EF9>, Ba Ria-Vung Tau|Phu My]]. At 1040, moving north-west with 2 Platoon leading, the Australians crossed a creek, the Suoi Chau Pha, and shortly afterwards located a fresh track which had only recently been used. O'Donnell ordered the lead platoon into [[ambush]] positions astride the track, while he moved forward to conduct a reconnaissance.<ref name=McNeill212>{{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|p=212}}.</ref> Minutes later two Viet Cong sentries walked into the ambush with their weapons slung, and they were killed instantly by a short burst from an [[M60 machine gun]], likely surprised by the silent insertion of the Australians.<ref name=Horner192>{{harvnb|Horner|2008|p=192}}.</ref>

The incident alerted the remainder of the Australians and the company prepared for action. Considering it unlikely that the dead men had been alone, O'Donnell assessed that the remainder of a Viet Cong [[squad]] was located somewhere further along the track and he subsequently requested artillery fire to block any escape, while 2 Platoon was ordered to sweep forward.<ref name=McNeill212/> Under the command of Second Lieutenant Graham Ross, 2 Platoon commenced its advance before coming under automatic fire {{convert|100|m|yd}} along the track by a Viet Cong squad which then went to ground after the Australians returned fire.<ref name=McNeill212/><ref name=Horner192/> Attempting to take the initiative, Ross began to manoeuvre for a quick attack, moving two sections to the high ground on the right flank, while the third section provided fire support.<ref name=McNeill212/><ref name=Horner192/> Meanwhile the Viet Cong force, which turned out to be larger than first thought by the Australians, also attempted a flanking manoeuvre, moving one squad into a defensive position while two squads moved to their left flank. Deploying to the high ground at about the same time the two assault groups came face to face and a fierce fire-fight followed at close range, with both sides throwing grenades in an attempt to gain the initiative. Two Australians were killed and several more were wounded in the initial clashes.<ref name=McNeill213>{{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|p=213}}.</ref>

2 Platoon was in trouble and the Australians were forced to fight hard in order to survive.<ref name=McNeill213/> Repeatedly exposing himself to the fire to throw grenades and direct his platoon's fire, Ross dragged two of his wounded men to safety during the fighting and despite being wounded in the leg by shrapnel he refused to be treated until the other wounded had received treatment. Meanwhile Private Dennis Bathersby, although wounded in the right arm, remained behind his M60 throwing two grenades with his left arm and only withdrawing in order to drag another wounded Australian to safety. Finally after his right arm went numb Ross ordered him to hand over his machine gun and he was evacuated to the rear.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|pp=215<U+2013>216}}.</ref> Elsewhere, Private Keith Downward, one of the forward scouts, after edging forward to within {{convert|10|m|yd}} then single handedly charged one of the Viet Cong machine guns, killing the operator and capturing the weapon before then dragging a wounded Australian soldier out of danger despite himself being wounded.<ref name=McNeill214/><ref name=Ham320>{{harvnb|Ham|2007|p=320}}.</ref> Amid the chaos a wasp nest in a nearby tree was disturbed, and a number of Australians were so badly stung that they were incapacitated and also needed to be evacuated.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|1995|p=60}}.</ref>

O'Donnell then attempted to probe the Viet Cong flank, and after locating it on the high ground he committed 1 Platoon<U+2014>under Second Lieutenant Rod Smith<U+2014>to conduct a right flanking attack. Beginning at 1130 the Australian assault soon ran into another Viet Cong platoon conducting a similar manoeuvre, and they became involved in an intense battle at close quarters with each side blocking the manoeuvre of the other.<ref name=McNeill213/> A heavy monsoon rain began, drenching the men as they faced each other at a range of just {{convert|30|m|yd}}, with seven Viet Cong machine guns facing six Australian machine guns at the height of the battle as the two Viet Cong platoons clashed with two Australian platoons.<ref name=Ham320/> The Australians suffered heavily, losing two section commanders killed and a dozen men wounded in the first few minutes.<ref name=McNeill213/> The fighting continued for another two hours as both forces traded shots, with neither the Australians nor the Viet Cong able to achieve a decisive advantage.<ref name=McNeill213/>

A Company's [[forward observation officer|forward observer]], Lieutenant Neville Clark, calmly directed artillery from the guns at Fire Support Base Giraffe on to the Viet Cong throughout the fighting, and as they had began massing for an all-out attack he had adjusted the artillery to within {{convert|50|m|yd}} of his own position, disregarding his own safety in order to break up the attack.<ref name=McNeill214/> The Viet Cong attempted to use "hugging tactics" to remain in close contact and remain under the Australian artillery barrage, while utilising rockets, grenades, machine-guns and small arms.<ref name=McNeill213/> Firing from over {{convert|10000|m|yd}} away, the Australian 105-mm howitzers were nearly at their {{convert|11000|m|yd|adj=on}} maximum range,<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|1995|p=58}}.</ref> yet they proved to be highly accurate and the rounds caused heavy casualties among the assaulting troops. A few Australians were also slightly wounded after one of the rounds struck a tree.<ref name=Horner193>{{harvnb|Horner|2008|p=193}}.</ref> In total, 106 Field Battery and the supporting American battery of the 2/35th Artillery Battalion fired 1,026 rounds in support of A Company during the fighting, while American 8-inch and 175-mm heavy artillery fired another 156 rounds.<ref name=McNeill214/> A number of airstrikes had also supported the Australians.<ref name=McNeill213/>

By 1430 the Viet Cong commander finally made the decision to withdraw, with the artillery deciding the battle in favour of the Australians.<ref name=Horner193/> O'Donnell had commanded the battle with cool resolve under constant fire throughout, setting the standard for his men and on one occasion he had run {{convert|30|m|yd}} through heavy fire to drag a wounded medic to safety.<ref name=McNeill213/>  Withdrawing through the barrage and a number of airstrikes called in to pursue them, the Viet Cong proceeded to drag their dead from the battlefield, having suffered crippling casualties.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|1995|p=61}}.</ref> B Company, 7RAR was subsequently inserted by helicopter into blocking positions to the north, however they made no contact.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|1995|p=62}}.</ref> Numerous blood trails were later found as the Australians attempted to follow up the Viet Cong.<ref name=McNeill214/>

Meanwhile, even as the battle had continued the evacuation of the Australian casualties had began, with a number of [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois |Iroquois helicopters]] from [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF]] under Squadron Leader Jim Cox, flying through heavy ground fire to complete the dust-off. Hindered by the artillery fire and the dense foliage the operation proved difficult and Cox's aircraft was hit by heavy machine gun fire, wounding him and an orderly on board. Safely landing the damaged aircraft he then directed the operation by radio from the ground.<ref name=McNeill214/> Among the worst of the casualties was Sergeant Alexander Sutherland, from 2 Platoon. Losing an eye and suffering heavy blood loss from multiple shrapnel wounds after a Viet Cong rocket exploded within a metre of him, he was evacuated to 8 Field Ambulance in [[Vung Tau]] with no pulse. His left leg later amputated, his wounds were so bad he had to be given a general anaesthetic each time his bandages were changed. Making a miraculous recovery however he was later personally recommended for the [[Medal of Honor]] by Westmoreland for his resolute spirit, although this was later reduced to a lesser Australian award. Many casualties were beyond help however, and the battalion padre was inserted by winch from a helicopter to administer last rites.<ref name=Ham320/>

On the basis of documents captured by the Australians during the battle the Viet Cong were identified as being from ''C12 Company, 3 Battalion, 274 Regiment'', probably assisted by the battalion ''Reconnaissance Platoon'' and a number of local force guides.<ref name=McNeill215>{{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|p=215}}.</ref><ref name=Horner192/> It was assessed that at least a second company of ''274 Regiment'' had helped in the recovery of many of the Viet Cong dead. Later, during operations the following day, a recently occupied battalion-sized camp was subsequently located about {{convert|900|m|yd}} from the site of the battle, and it was considered likely that the Viet Cong company had fought the vigorous action in order the delay the Australians and enable the withdrawal of the remainder of 3 Battalion from their base camp.<ref name=Kuring331/> Meanwhile elements of the ''Chau Duc District Company'' were also believed to located in the area.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|1995|p=63}}.</ref><ref group="Note">Two Viet Cong soldiers from the ''Chau Duc District Company'' were later killed and two wounded during a subsequently contact with 4 Platoon, B Company on 13 August. See {{harvnb|O'Brien|1995|p=63}}.</ref>

==Aftermath==
Australian casualties had been heavy with five killed, one died of wounds and 20 wounded.<ref name=McNeill215/><ref group="Note">Some discrepancies in Australian casualties exist between sources. The figures given are from the official history, while other figures include 17 or 19 wounded, see {{harvnb|Kuring|2004|p=331}} and {{harvnb|Horner|2008|p=193}}.</ref> Meanwhile the extent of Viet Cong casualties were difficult to assess, as most had been removed from the battlefield by the communists as they had during previous battles.<ref name=McNeill215/> A sweep of the area by the Australians subsequently resulted in the recovery of only five dead Viet Cong, however drag marks and extensive blood trails indicated that they had suffered heavily, with perhaps another 33 killed or wounded in the contact. A further 200 casualties were estimated to have occurred from artillery and mortar fire, as well as a number of airstrikes.<ref name=McNeill215/><ref group="Note">Most sources state that only five Viet Cong bodies were recovered, although one states that 10 were located during the sweep, see {{harvnb|Horner|2008|p=225}}. Terry Burstall, in his controversial book ''Vietnam&nbsp;<U+2013> The Australian Dilemma'', lists these casualties as 'possibles' only, questioning the efficacy of the Australian reporting. However Burstall's agenda and research methodology have been widely criticised, and official records make it clear that five bodies were indeed counted, while a further five bodies were observed but not recovered, see {{harvnb|O'Brien|1995|p=61}}.</ref> Among the dead were one officer, believed to have been the platoon commander, and two non-commissioned officers.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|1995|p=61}}.</ref> Also recovered were a light machine gun, a 40-mm recoilless rifle and three AK 47 assault rifles, while other weapons, a quantity of rice and a battalion-sized bunker system were subsequently also captured.<ref name=McNeill215/>

A classic encounter battle, the action had been fought between two forces of roughly equal size in the heavy monsoon rain at close quarters. Both companies had deployed to the high ground at around the same time in a bid to outflank the other, with the Australian infantry skilfully using their supporting artillery while the Viet Cong had attempted to nullify the Australian tactics by remaining in close contact. Ultimately the artillery had decided the outcome in favour of the Australians however, and the Viet Cong had been forced to withdraw with heavy casualties.<ref name=McNeill213/><ref name=Kuring331>{{harvnb|Kuring |2004|p=331}}.</ref> In this way the fighting bore many similarities to the Australian victory twelve months earlier at Long Tan, yet it remained largely unheralded in Australia.<ref>{{harvnb|Horner|2008|p=195}}.</ref> Eight Australian soldiers received gallantry awards for their actions, including [[Military Cross]]es to O'Donnell, Ross and Clark, while Sutherland was awarded the [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]]. A number of awards were also made to the RAAF pilots and aircrew, including Cox who was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross]].<ref name=Ham320/><ref name=McNeill214/> Meanwhile the bravery evident by the Viet Cong during the battle had made an impression on the Australians also, who later acknowledged their tight fire discipline and the skilfulness of their battle drills. The battle had also demonstrated that many of the Viet Cong tactics were similar to those used by the Australians themselves, and they learned a lot about their opponents as a result of the fighting.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|p=216}}.</ref>

A month after disappearing ''274 Regiment'' had emerged without warning and had caught 7RAR by surprise with the unexpected presence of a Viet Cong Main Force regiment in the Hat Dich forcing the Australians to change their tactics for the remainder of ''Operation Ballarat'', becoming more cautious as a result.<ref name=McNeill215/> 7RAR continued its search and destroy mission, however only two companies patrolled while the other two remained on standby in fire support bases nearby to provide support if required. Additional artillery support was also made available, with [[Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery|161 Field Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery]] airlifted into Fire Support Base Giraffe.<ref name=McNeill215_216>{{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|pp=215<U+2013>216}}.</ref> Meanwhile Graham placed 2RAR on standby to fly into the area if needed and US forces were also positioned to the north.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|1995|p=62}}.</ref> In this manner Ballarat continued until 16 August, however there was only minor contact which resulted in two more Viet Cong killed, two wounded and one captured for no further loss to the Australians.<ref name=McNeill215_216/>

Australian operations in Phuoc Tuy province continued throughout the remainder of 1967, and although they were largely successful at the tactical level, the Viet Cong were still capable of accessing most of the villages in the province and causing increasingly heavy Allied casualties with mines lifted from the controversial barrier minefield laid by the Australians. ''Operation Santa Fe'', a further large-scale joint US-Australian operation, took place in October&nbsp;<U+2013> November, but it too ended with only limited success in comparison to the resources committed.<ref name=Kuring331/><ref group="Note">Australian involvement in ''Operation Santa Fe'' (27 October&nbsp;<U+2013> 18 November) resulted in 38 Viet Cong killed, nine wounded and one captured. Australian casualties included three killed and eight wounded. By the time American forces ended the operation on 5 January 1968 a total of 126 Viet Cong had been killed and 32 captured, while the communist logistic network had been heavily disrupted, tonnes of supplies captured and thousands of bunkers and installations destroyed. See {{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|pp=260<U+2013>261}}.</ref> Meanwhile, South Vietnam's presidential elections in September proved an extraordinary success, with 83% of eligible voters turning out nationwide, while in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at 91%; the highest percentage in any province.<ref name=Ham317_318/> However, with the war approaching a stalemate strategically, the Australians were substantially reinforced following the trend of further American troop increases, with a third infantry battalion arriving in December, while a [[squadron (cavalry)|squadron]] of [[Centurion tank]]s and additional Iroquois helicopters were added in early-1968.<ref>{{harvnb|Kuring|2004|pp=331<U+2013>332}}.</ref> Total Australian strength in Vietnam grew to over 8,000 men, its peak during the war, effectively doubling the combat power available to the task force commander.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|p=249}}.</ref> By the end of the year American military strength in Vietnam had risen to 486,000 men while South Vietnamese forces had expanded to 643,000.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|p=285}}</ref>

In spite of this build up North Vietnamese strength in South Vietnam also increased growing to 278,000 men, and although communist strategy remained fundamentally one of protected war, preparations for a strategic offensive had reached an advanced stage.<ref>{{harvnb|Van Thai |2002|pp=207<U+2013>211}}.</ref> Culminating in the [[Tet Offensive]] in early-1968, the offensive would aim to provoke a popular general uprising among the South Vietnamese people against the government and its American supporters and would take the form of a massive simultaneous surprise attack on population centres through out South Vietnam.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Ekins|2003|p=287}}.</ref> 1ATF would later be heavily involved in the fighting during Tet, deploying astride communist [[lines of communication]] in support of American and South Vietnamese forces defending the [[Long Binh]]-[[Bien Hoa]] complex north-east of [[Saigon]] during [[Operation Coburg]], while also repelling repeated Viet Cong attacks against [[Ba Ria]] and [[Long Dien]] in Phuoc Tuy province.<ref>{{harvnb|Horner|2008|pp=197<U+2013>198}}.</ref>
