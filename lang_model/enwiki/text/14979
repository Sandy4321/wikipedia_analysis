'''''New Super Mario Bros.''''' is a [[side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platform]] [[video game]] published and developed by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo DS]] [[handheld game console]]. The game was released in North America and Japan in May 2006, in Australia and Europe in June 2006, and in Korea in March 2007. It is the first original side-scrolling platform game starring [[Mario]] since ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins]]'' in 1992, and it is the first game to be a part of the main ''[[Mario (series)|Mario]]'' series of video games since ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' in 2002.

The game's story is similar to those of other side-scrolling ''Mario'' games. ''New Super Mario Bros.'' follows the titular Mario as he fights his way through [[Bowser (Nintendo)|Bowser]]'s henchmen to rescue [[Princess Peach]]. Mario has access to several [[power-up]]s that help him complete his quest, including the Super Mushroom, the Fire Flower, and the Starman, each giving him unique abilities. While traveling to eight worlds with ten levels in each, Mario must defeat [[Bowser Jr.]] and Bowser before finally saving Princess Peach.

Reviews were generally favorable towards the game, which received an aggregated score of 89% from [[Metacritic]]. Praise focused on improvements made to the ''Mario'' franchise, while criticism targeted the game's simplicity. ''New Super Mario Bros.'' received several honors, including Game of the Month awards from ''[[Game Informer]]'' and ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'', and Editors' Choice Awards from [[IGN]] and [[GameSpot]]. In Japan, the game broke the record for the best-selling debut for a Nintendo DS game. A month after its release in the United States, over half a million copies of the game were sold there.

==Plot==
At the beginning of the game, [[Princess Peach]] and [[Mario]] are walking together, when lightning suddenly strikes Peach's castle nearby. As Mario runs to help, [[Bowser Jr.]] appears and kidnaps Peach. Realizing what has happened, Mario quickly rushes back and chases after Bowser Jr. Mario must venture through eight worlds to rescue the Princess from Bowser Jr. Mario chases Bowser Jr. through the eight worlds while Bowser Jr. drags the princess behind him. Mario confronts Bowser Jr. occasionally, but is unable to save the princess from his clutches. At the end of the first world, Bowser Jr. retreats to a castle, where his father [[Bowser (Nintendo)|Bowser]] awaits on a bridge. Mario activates a button behind Bowser to defeat him, and the bridge underneath Bowser collapses, causing him to fall into the lava pit below and kill him.<ref name=game>{{cite video game |title=New Super Mario Bros |developer=Nintendo EAD |publisher=Nintendo |platform=Nintendo DS |date=May 15, 2006 }}</ref><ref name=manual />

Mario continues chasing Bowser Jr. through the remaining worlds and conquers more bosses until he reaches a castle in the Koopa Kingdom. There, Bowser Jr. animates Bowser's skeleton, but once again Mario defeats Bowser by dropping him into a deep pit. Bowser Jr. flees once more across a lava chasm to a larger castle, where he throws Bowser's bones into a cauldron and reincarnates Bowser into a more powerful form. Together, they attack Mario in tandem, but Mario drops the pair into the pit below. In the game's final sequence, Mario rescues Princess Peach, who kisses him on the cheek.<ref name=game /><ref name=manual />

More than 20 years after ''Super Mario Bros.'' was released, [[Nintendo]] announced on February 21, 2006 that ''New Super Mario Bros.'' would launch for the [[Nintendo DS]] on May 7, 2006. The game's new power-ups were also introduced at the same time, including the Blue Shell and the Mega Mushroom. Nintendo further mentioned that the game would be played in 2D but use 3D models to create a 2.5D look and feel.<ref name=gamezone-new /><ref name=nwr-preview /> The game's release date was eventually pushed back slightly, to May 15; Nintendo planned to release it around the same time that the [[Nintendo DS Lite]] launched, on June 11, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2008-12-28 |url=http://www.gamezone.com/news/05_04_06_07_06AM.htm |title=New Nintendo DS Lites the Way for Mario  |publisher=GameZone |date=2006-05-04 }}</ref>

The game's designers were given much more freedom with designs in ''New Super Mario Bros.'' compared to previous 2D ''Mario'' games. Characters, enemies, and objects could now be created with much more detailed animations, without requiring that they be designed by hand. To provide visual cues, the developers made the game's camera more dynamic; it zooms in and out of action depending on the situation to provide focus where necessary.<ref name=e32005>{{cite web |accessdate=2008-12-28 |url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/616/616760p1.html |title=E3 2005: New Super Mario Bros.

Physics plays an important role in ''New Super Mario Bros.''{{'}}s improved game mechanics. Without the rigid restrictions of [[Tile-based game|tile-based]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] and backgrounds, the designers were free to explore new [[game mechanics|gameplay mechanics]]; when Mario lands on top of a tree, it teeters over and eventually falls if Mario is stationary for too long. Mario can also swing on ropes and walk on wires that bend and stretch under his weight.<ref name=e32005 />

Early in the game's development, the developers planned not to use voice acting to stay true to the spirit of the original ''Super Mario Bros.'' However, voice acting was eventually embraced by the developers, who decided that it would serve the game in a positive manner. Although voice acting was used in earlier 2D ''Mario'' [[enhanced remake|remakes]], ''New Super Mario Bros.'' is the first original 2D ''Mario'' game to use voice acting. [[Charles Martinet]] returned to voice Mario and Luigi, along with [[Nicole Mills]] as Princess Peach, [[Scott Burns (voice actor)|Scott Burns]] as Bowser, and [[Dolores Rogers]] as Bowser Jr.<ref name=np-sizing>{{cite journal|author=Thomason, Steve|journal=Nintendo Power|issue=202|title=Sizing Up Mario|page=41<U+2013>42}}</ref> ''New Super Mario Bros.'' features original music composed by [[Asuka Ohta]] and [[Hajime Wakai]], under the direction of the original ''Super Mario Bros.'' composer, [[Koji Kondo]].<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2008-12-28 |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/nintendo-ds/new-super-mario-bros/credits |title=Staff Credits |publisher=MobyGames }}</ref>

The game was praised by numerous reviews, several of which noted that ''New Super Mario Bros.'' was one of the best games available for the Nintendo DS. [[GameZone]] believed that it was the "hot game" to purchase for any DS owner, noting its "huge exploration potential" and reinvention of the [[platform game]] genre.<ref name=gamezone /> Tom Bramwell of [[Eurogamer]] stated, "I've done this sort of thing before hundreds of times across thousands of days in what feels like a dozen Mario games. I still love it."<ref name=eurogamer /> Believing that experienced players would require very little time to complete the game, [[GameSpot]] nevertheless considered ''New Super Mario Bros.'' a "completely awesome" game that was an "absolutely necessary" video game to own.<ref name=gamespot /> [[GamesRadar]] considered the game a bargain, noting that it included "a completely solid solo game, a simple-but-exciting two-player, and then a collection of super-quick stylus games".<ref name=gamesradar />

Several reviewers drew comparisons between ''New Super Mario Bros.'' and their favorite ''Mario'' games. Although some found that other ''Mario'' games were better, most reviewers were still pleased with the overall experience of the game. Craig Harris of [[IGN]] was enthused with ''New Super Mario Bros.'', claiming that it was his new favorite [[platform game]], beating out his previous favorite, ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]''.<ref name=ign /> Even though ''[[Super Mario World]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' were considered the best 2D ''Mario'' games by ''[[GamePro]]''{{'}}s Mr. Marbles, he decided to add ''New Super Mario Bros.'' as his third favorite ''Mario'' game, which he admitted had much more [[replay value]] than the other two.<ref name=gamepro /> Despite including new features such as a versus mode, the game made [[Game Revolution]] disconcertedly ask the question, "Can Mario ever truly be new again?"<ref name=gamerev /> It also disappointed Greg Sewart of [[X-Play]], who found that the game did not live up to the standards set by its predecessors, but still considered the game the best [[side-scrolling video game]] available for the Nintendo DS.<ref name=xplay />

The game's graphics and audio received praise in a number of reviews. The ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' magazine was entertained by the "finely-crafted slice of [...] Mario", along with the extra minigames offered. They believed that the audio was very good for a Nintendo DS game, predicting that "it'd still scare the pants of {{sic}} the hard-of-hearing."<ref name=cvg /> Despite being a 2D game, [[GameSpy]] still found that the 2D and 3D elements blended together perfectly in ''New Super Mario Bros.''<ref name=gamespy /> The game's overall experience pleased [[1UP.com]], which applauded Nintendo's ability to once again create an enjoyable, solid, and challenging portable experience. However, they were disappointed in the lack of imagination for this remake.<ref name=1up />

''New Super Mario Bros.'' received numerous awards and accolades. It was given Game of the Month awards from ''[[Game Informer]]''<ref>{{cite journal |title=Game of the Month |date=July 2006 |page=110 |journal=Game Informer }}</ref> and ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'',<ref>{{cite journal |title=Game of the Month |journal=Electronic Gaming Monthly |issue=205 }}</ref> and it received Editors' Choice Awards from [[IGN]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ds.ign.com/index/choice.html |title=Editors' Choice Awards |publisher=IGN |date= |accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref> and [[GameSpot]].<ref name=gamespot /> The game was voted Best Handheld Game at the 2006 [[Spike TV Video Game Awards]]<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2008-12-28 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6161328.html |title=Spike TV's 2006 game awards detailed |publisher=GameSpot |date=2006-11-08 |author=Sinclair, Brendan }}</ref> and Best Nintendo DS Game by GameSpot,<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2008-12-28 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/special_features/bestof2006/platform/index.html?page=3 |title=Best Nintendo DS Game |publisher=GameSpot }}</ref> and it won Best Platformer awards from [[X-Play]]<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2008-12-28 |url=http://www.g4tv.com/g4/press/162/G4s_XPLAY_Unveils_Nominations_for_Best_Video_Games_of_2006.html?detectflash=false |title=G4<U+2019>s <U+2018>X-PLAY<U+2019> Unveils Nominations for Best Video Games of 2006   |publisher=G4 |date=2006-12-08 }}</ref> and ''[[Nintendo Power]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Nintendo Power Awards 2006 |journal=Nintendo Power |date=May 2007 }}</ref> The game was awarded Choice Video Game at the 2006 [[Teen Choice Awards]]<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2008-12-28 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1538972/20060821/spears_britney.jhtml |title=Britney Introduces K-Fed, Nick Lachey Scores 'Awkward' Award At Teen Choice 2006 |publisher=MTV |date=2006-08-21 |author=Moss, Corey}}</ref> and Nintendo Game of the Year at the 2006 [[Golden Joystick Award]].<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2008-12-28 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6160584.html |title=Oblivion, Nintendo win Golden Joysticks |publisher=GameSpot |date=2006-10-27 |author=Jenner, Laura }}</ref>
