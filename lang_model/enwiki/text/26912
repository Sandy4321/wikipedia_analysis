Meanwhile, Marge sends Lisa to a performing arts camp for a week.

The episode was written by [[Tim Long]] and directed by [[Mark Kirkland]]. Upon airing, it was met with mixed reception from television.

==Plot==
As Homer, Lisa, and her friends watch the announcement of the year's [[Nobel Prize]] winners, they are astounded to hear that [[Krusty the Clown]] has won the Peace Prize. Krusty picks Homer to accompany him to [[Oslo]] for the awards ceremony, and Homer decides to take Bart with him. Their plane lands in [[The Hague]], and it is revealed that the Peace Prize announcement was a ruse to bring Krusty there so he could be tried by the [[International Court of Justice]] for his deplorable public behavior over the years. Homer and Bart search desperately for any evidence to show that Krusty has made a genuine [[Humanitarianism|contribution to humanity]], and eventually argue that his refusal to perform at a particular show led directly to the [[South Africa]]n [[Government of South Africa|government]]'s decision to [[Nelson Mandela#Release|release Nelson Mandela]] from prison. Even though it is obvious that these two incidents were coincidental and irrelevant, the court accepts this argument and frees Krusty, who immediately seeks out the nearest place to buy [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] <U+2014> the courthouse cafeteria.

Meanwhile, Marge surprises Lisa by sending her to a performing arts camp for a week. She eagerly immerses herself there in music and theater, meeting several campers who love to break into song and two guitar-playing hipster counselors, Ethan and Kurt. When Marge takes her home at the end of the week, Lisa has trouble readjusting to normal life and looks for a chance to express her newly awakened creative side. She runs away from home and seeks out Ethan and Kurt in "Sprooklyn", described by the counselors as the "artistic hotbed of Springfield". However, she soon learns that they have grossly exaggerated the area, which is really a run-down slum, and that Ethan and Kurt actually work at a sandwich shop. They encourage her to return to her family and think about trying to make an artistic name for herself when she is older. As Marge arrives to take Lisa home, Ethan and Kurt show off a mural that they have painted in her honor, which takes up an entire side of a building.

Television critics were polarized with "Elementary School Musical". Todd VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a 'C+' grade. Although he expressed satisfaction towards many aspects of the episode, such as the character development of Lisa Simpson, VanDerWerff criticized the songs performed in the episode. In response to the appearance of [[Jemaine Clement]] and [[Bret McKenzie]] of the [[Flight of the Conchords]], he stated: "I have no idea if the writers wrote new songs for the two guys in Flight of the Conchords to sing [...] but the songs they sang were pretty weak."<ref name="a.v."/> Similarly, VanDerWerff was critical of the guest appearances of Michele, Riley, and Monteith, and stated: "Bringing in the ''Glee'' kids to sing a take on "[[Good Vibrations]]" that was, frankly, awful mostly just felt like an attempt to have guest stars in nothing parts so they could be promoted.<ref name="a.v."/> In contrast, Brad Trechak of ''[[TV Squad]]'' felt that the "Elementary School Musical" was an enjoyable start to the twenty-second season of the series, and retorted that the appearances of Clement and McKenzie was the highlight of the episode.<ref name="tvsquad"/> Similarly, Eric Hochberger of ''TV Fanatic'' wrote, "We actually loved Bret and Jemaine doing what they do best last night: playing characterized versions of themselves.  Unlike the ''Glee'' kids, our favorite duo from New Zealand were given decent songs and some pretty great lines."<ref name=tvfan/> Hochberger gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars.<ref name=tvfan>{{cite web |title=The Simpsons Season Premiere Review: "Elementary School Musical"|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2010/09/the-simpsons-review-elementary-school-musical/|first=Eric|last=Hochberger|work=TV Fanatic|date=2010-09-27|accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref>
