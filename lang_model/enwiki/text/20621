'''''The Best of George Harrison''''' is a 1976 compilation album by [[George Harrison]], released following the expiration of his [[EMI]] recording contract. Uniquely among all the four [[Beatles]]' solo releases, it mixes a selection of the artist's Beatles-era songs with later hits recorded under his own name.

''The Best of George Harrison'' was the first of three Harrison compilation albums, and was followed by 1989's ''[[Best of Dark Horse 1976<U+2013>1989]]'' and the posthumous ''[[Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison]]'', in 2009.

== Background ==
With all the former Beatles' contracts with EMI and US distributor [[Capitol Records]] having expired in January 1976, and only [[Paul McCartney]] choosing to re-sign with Capitol, the two record companies were free to license releases featuring songs from the band's back catalogue and the individual members' solo work, without the need for artist's approval.<ref name=autogenerated1>Nicholas Schaffner, ''The Beatles Forever'', McGraw-Hill (New York, NY, 1978), p. 188.</ref> Along with accompanying [[single (music)|singles]], the [[double album]] ''[[Rock 'n' Roll Music (album)|Rock 'n' Roll Music]]'' was Capitol's first venture under this new arrangement, in June 1976, containing 28 previously released tracks from throughout The Beatles' career.<ref name=autogenerated2>Keith Badham, ''The Beatles Diary Volume 2: After the Break-Up 1970<U+2212>2001'', Omnibus Press (London, 2002), p. 186.</ref> [[John Lennon]] and [[Ringo Starr]] both expressed dissatisfaction with the compilation, particularly Capitol's choice of packaging.<ref>Keith Badham, ''The Beatles Diary Volume 2: After the Break-Up 1970<U+2212>2001'', Omnibus Press (London, 2002), p. 195.</ref> Nevertheless, after what the record company had promised would be "the largest selling campaign in the history of the music business", the recycled product was a major commercial success.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

Late the previous year, EMI/Capitol had issued greatest-hits collections for Lennon and Starr <U+2212> ''[[Shaved Fish]]'' and ''[[Blast from Your Past]]'' <U+2212> both of which sold reasonably well. For George Harrison, though, due to the long delays between releases following his ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' post-breakup triumph, he had only completed his quota of studio albums in the autumn of '75, with ''[[Extra Texture (Read All About It)]]''. Come the second half of 1976, thanks partly to the success of ''Rock 'n' Roll Music'', nostalgia for all things Beatles continued to fill the airwaves.<ref>Keith Badham, ''The Beatles Diary Volume 2: After the Break-Up 1970<U+2212>2001'', Omnibus Press (London, 2002), pp 190<U+2212>91.</ref> Increasingly generous offers from rival promoters Bill Sargent and [[Sid Bernstein]] for a one-off Beatles reunion concert,<ref>Roy Carr & Tony Tyler, ''The Beatles: An Illustrated Record'', Trewin Copplestone Publishing (London, 1978), pp 118, 122.</ref><ref>Keith Badham, ''The Beatles Diary Volume 2: After the Break-Up 1970<U+2212>2001'', Omnibus Press (London, 2002), p. 191.</ref> [[20th Century Fox]]'s musical documentary ''[[All This and World War II]]'' (for which, as with the earlier stage play ''[[John, Paul, George, Ringo <U+2026> and Bert]]'', Harrison would refuse permission for any of his songs to appear)<ref>Keith Badham, ''The Beatles Diary Volume 2: After the Break-Up 1970<U+2212>2001'', Omnibus Press (London, 2002), p. 196.</ref><ref>Alan Clayson, ''George Harrison'', Sanctuary (London, 2003), p. 362.</ref> and [[Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel]] hitting the UK top ten with their cover of "[[Here Comes the Sun]]" were all examples of this heightened interest.<ref>Alan Clayson, ''George Harrison'', Sanctuary (London, 2003), p. 285.</ref><ref>Nicholas Schaffner, ''The Beatles Forever'', McGraw-Hill (New York, NY, 1978), pp 171<U+2212>72, 190.</ref> Sensing the mood, Capitol chose to combine the idea of a Harrison greatest-hits compilation with an experiment whereby Beatles tracks were mixed with solo hits on the one package.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Predictably, the artist immediately disavowed the venture<ref name=autogenerated1 /> <U+2212> he being the least attached to the Beatles legacy of all his former bandmates<ref>The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', ''Harrison'', Rolling Stone Press/Simon & Schuster (New York, NY, 2002), p. 40.</ref> <U+2212> and it was a concept that would never be repeated for further Beatle-related releases.

== Song selection ==
To fill one side of the [[LP record|LP]], Capitol selected Harrison-penned songs that had been released by [[The Beatles]] between 1965 and 1970. As with the unimaginative album title, a risk-free approach prevailed<ref name=autogenerated1 /> <U+2212> nowhere was [[Music of India|Indian music]] represented, for instance, a musical genre with which Harrison was synonymous and with which he had helped revolutionise Western culture during the mid and late '60s.<ref>Paul Theroux's introduction, in Olivia Harrison, ''George Harrison: Living in the Material World'', Abrams (New York, NY, 2011), p. 12.</ref><ref>The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', ''Harrison'', Rolling Stone Press/Simon & Schuster (New York, NY, 2002), pp 34, 36.</ref> In this way, "landmark" songs<ref>Michael Simmons, "Paul McCartney on George Harrison: Part 2", ''Mojo'', September 2011, http://www.mojo4music.com/blog/2011/09/paul_mccartney_on_george_harri.html (retrieved 18 April 2012).</ref> such as "[[Within You, Without You]]" and "[[The Inner Light (song)|The Inner Light]]" were overlooked while "[[Taxman]]" received its second album release in six months (having been included on the ''Rock 'n' Roll Music'' compilation).

Side two was made up of Harrison's biggest solo hits: "[[My Sweet Lord]]" and "[[What Is Life]]" from ''All Things Must Pass'' (1970), "[[Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)|Give Me Love]]" from ''[[Living in the Material World]]'' (1973), the [[Dark Horse (song)|title track]] from ''[[Dark Horse (George Harrison album)|Dark Horse]]'' (1974), and "[[You (George Harrison song)|You]]" from ''Extra Texture'' (1975). The sixth solo offering was the non-album single "[[Bangla Desh (song)|Bangla Desh]]", released in 1971. 

Aside from the obvious commercial value of repackaging Beatles-era selections, part of the reason for Capitol reducing Harrison's (mostly) successful solo years thus far into a mere half-dozen tracks was due to his tendency to limit single releases to a minimum. He'd been reluctant to issue any [[Gramophone record#Speeds|45]] from ''All Things Must Pass'' originally,<ref>Keith Badham, ''The Beatles Diary Volume 2: After the Break-Up 1970<U+2212>2001'', Omnibus Press (London, 2002), p. 15.</ref> and the scheduled second single from ''Living in the Material World'', "[[Don't Let Me Wait Too Long]]", was cancelled altogether.<ref>Chip Madinger & Mark Easter, ''Eight Arms to Hold You: The Solo Compendium'', 44.1 Productions (Chesterfield, MO, 2000), pp 440<U+2212>41, 456.</ref><ref>Simon Leng, ''While My Guitar Gently Weeps: The Music of George Harrison'', Hal Leonard (Milwaukee, WI, 2006), pp 128<U+2212>29.</ref>

In November 1976, while promoting his new, [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner]]-distributed ''[[Thirty Three & 1/3]]'' album, Harrison reported that he'd offered Capitol a suggested track list and an alternative title for the collection.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=autogenerated3>Keith Badham, ''The Beatles Diary Volume 2: After the Break-Up 1970<U+2212>2001'', Omnibus Press (London, 2002), p. 197.</ref> Although he did not elaborate, notable omissions from ''The Best of George Harrison'' were "[[Isn't It a Pity]]" <U+2212> one half of the [[A-side_and_B-side#Double_A-side|double A-side]] single with "My Sweet Lord", and a number 1 hit in Canada in its own right <U+2212> and "[[Ding Dong, Ding Dong]]", only a modest success in the main markets of America and Britain, but a top ten hit in Europe.<ref>GfK Dutch Charts, [[http://dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=George+Harrison&titel=Ding+Dong%2C+Ding+Dong&cat=s|George Harrison: Ding Dong, Ding Dong]] (retrieved 17 April 2012).</ref> In addition, following the precedents set by both ''Shaved Fish'' and ''Blast from Your Past'' (as Harrison noted)<ref name=autogenerated3 /> <U+2212> where non-hits, B-sides and album highlights appeared <U+2212> the songs "[[All Things Must Pass (song)|All Things Must Pass]]", "[[Awaiting on You All]]", "[[Beware of Darkness (song)|Beware of Darkness]]", "[[Bangla Desh (song)|Deep Blue]]" and "[[Sue Me, Sue You Blues]]" would all appear to have been worthy of inclusion.

''The Best of George Harrison'' was released in November 1976 on EMI's [[Parlophone]] label in Britain (catalogue number PAS 10011) and as Capitol DT 11578 in America.<ref>Nicholas Schaffner, ''The Beatles Forever'', McGraw-Hill (New York, NY, 1978), pp 209, 212.</ref> Some sources give the UK date as 14 January 1977, however, implying that the Harrison compilation was delayed there to make way for the release of The Beatles' ''[[Magical Mystery Tour]]'' <U+2212> an album cobbled together by Capitol in 1967 but a consistent seller overseas on import ever since.<ref>Roy Carr & Tony Tyler, ''The Beatles: An Illustrated Record'', Trewin Copplestone Publishing (London, 1978), pp 121, 122.</ref>

In the US, with Harrison on the campaign trail and enjoying some of his best reviews in years for the concurrent ''Thirty Three & 1/3'',<ref>Nicholas Schaffner, ''The Beatles Forever'', McGraw-Hill (New York, NY, 1978), p. 192.</ref> the compilation reached number 31 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. By 15 February 1977, it had earned a [[Gold record|gold disc]] in America for sales of over 500,000 units.<ref name=autogenerated6>RIAA <U+2212> Recording Industry Association of America, "RIAA's Gold & Platinum Program", http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database (retrieved 18 April 2012); ''search by album title''.</ref> 

No doubt not helped by the much-hyped competing Beatles release, ''The Best of George Harrison'' failed to place at all on the UK's Top 60 Albums Chart. EMI, in an attempt to capitalise on recent publicity from the ruling on Bright Tunes' [[My Sweet Lord#Legal controversy|plagiarism suit]] against Harrison, also reissued "My Sweet Lord" (backed with "What Is Life") as a single on 25 December.<ref>Roy Carr & Tony Tyler, ''The Beatles: An Illustrated Record'', Trewin Copplestone Publishing (London, 1978), p. 122.</ref>

The album's content drew further criticism from critics and fans alike, since the overall effect obviously diminished the significance of Harrison's solo years.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Sometime ''[[The Village Voice|Village Voice]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' contributor Nicholas Schaffner observed a couple of minor positives, however: "''The Best of George Harrison'' does confirm that George's big production numbers from ''All Things Must Pass'' more than hold their own alongside the seven featured Beatles tunes (even if some of the subsequent output doesn't). And the album is undeniably better looking than ''[[Rock 'n' Roll Music (album)|Rock 'n' Roll Music]]''."<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Regarding the controversial choice of tracks, but rather missing the issue of what had passed as a hit song on Starr's best-of compilation, in particular, [[Allmusic]]'s Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes: "But all this is down to a matter of timing and circumstance: Harrison needed to have a hits collection out in 1976, he didn't have enough big hits to fill out 13 tracks (even if he certainly had enough great album tracks to do so), and so the Fabs were brought in to fill in the cracks. The result might be a little underwhelming in retrospect, but it's undeniably entertaining."<ref name=autogenerated4>Stephen Thomas Erlewine, "George Harrison ''The Best of George Harrison''", [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r8996/review|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic review] (retrieved 17 April 2012).</ref>

Despite the more recent Harrison compilation albums, and the 2005 re-release of the ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh (album)|Concert for Bangladesh]]'' live set and [[The Concert for Bangladesh|documentary film]], ''The Best of George Harrison'' remains the only release featuring [[Pop music|pop]]'s first-ever charity single, "Bangla Desh".

== Cover art ==
The North American and British versions of the album were released with wildly different covers. In the United States and Canada, the front and back cover had small black-and-white pictures of Harrison against an image of the cosmos;<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Roy Kohara was responsible for art design (as he had been for ''Extra Texture''), while the illustrations were the work of Michael Bryan.<ref name=autogenerated5>Graham Calkin's Beatles Pages, "The Best of George Harrison", http://www.jpgr.co.uk/pas10011.html (retrieved 17 April 2012).</ref> The UK edition contained [[Bob Cato]]'s colour photo of Harrison sitting in front of an antique car, with art direction for the package being credited to Cream designs.<ref name=autogenerated5 /> The international CD release of the album uses the latter cover.<ref>{{cite web|title=George Harrison - The Best Of George Harrison (CD) at Discogs|url=http://www.discogs.com/George-Harrison-The-Best-Of-George-Harrison/release/1080703|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=18 April 2012}}</ref>  

The inner sleeve of the original LP in Britain contained a picture by [[Michael Putland]], showing Harrison on a wintry beach in [[Cannes]], where he was attending the Midem music-industry trade fair in January 1976.<ref>Keith Badham, ''The Beatles Diary Volume 2: After the Break-Up 1970<U+2212>2001'', Omnibus Press (London, 2002), pp 175<U+2212>76.</ref>

A third front-cover option came with [[Music for Pleasure (record label)|MFP]]'s budget reissue during the '80s, which reproduced Harrison's 1968 ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]'' portrait.<ref>{{cite web|title=George Harrison - The Best Of George Harrison (Vinyl, LP) at Discogs|url=http://www.discogs.com/George-Harrison-The-Best-Of-George-Harrison/release/1545150|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=18 April 2012}}</ref>
