'''Lonny Leroy Baxter''' (born [[January 27]] [[1979]] in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]]) is an [[United States|American]] professional [[basketball]] player. 

While attending the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], he won the 2002 [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Championship]] along with teammates and future NBA players [[Juan Dixon]], [[Steve Blake]] and [[Chris Wilcox]] by defeating [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana]]. He was selected by the [[Chicago Bulls]] with the 15th pick of the second round (43rd overall) of the [[2002 NBA Draft]].

During the 2004-05 season he played some games for the Greek giants [[Panathinaikos BC|Panathinaikos]], before getting injured and agreeing with the club for his release.

On February 9, 2006, Baxter was traded by the [[Houston Rockets]] to the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] for [[Keith Bogans]].

On August 8, 2006, Baxter signed with [[Italy|Italian]] League team [[Montepaschi Siena]].

On August 16, 2006, Baxter was arrested in [[Washington, DC]], only a few blocks from the [[White House]] after firing a .40 caliber [[Glock]] handgun into the air.  On August 23, 2006, Baxter was sentenced to 60 days in prison after pleading guilty to possession of an unregistered firearm and unregistered ammunition charges.  The judge in the case did not accept the plea bargain that had been arranged with the prosecution for a sentence of time served.  

"There's no good reason for a person who's not working in law enforcement or presidential protection to be in possession of a loaded weapon within blocks of the White House, let alone to fire it into the air," Iscoe said.

Baxter was later charged with shipping four guns via [[FedEx]] in July 2006 without notifying them that the shipment contained firearms.  Baxter [[plea bargain|pled guilty]] to this crime on [[July 19]], [[2007]].<ref>[http://www.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/story/10261990 Ex-Terp, former Bull Baxter pleads guilty to illegally shipping guns]</ref> He has been sentenced to 60 days in jail, two years of supervised release and a $2,000 fine on [[August 31]], [[2007]].<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/31/AR2007083101175.html Former Terp Baxter Sentenced to 60 Days in Prison]</ref>
