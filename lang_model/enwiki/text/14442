"'''There's No Disgrace Like Home'''" is the fourth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 1)|first season]]. It first aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on January 28, 1990.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season1/page4.shtml|title=There's No Disgrace Like Home|accessdate=2008-01-14|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |year=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref> In the episode, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] becomes ashamed of his family after a catastrophic company picnic and decides to enroll them in therapy. The therapist struggles to solve their problems but eventually gives up and refunds their payment. It was an early episode, showing early designs for a few recurring characters. The episode is inspired by the comedy of [[Laurel and Hardy]] and features cultural references to films such as ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' and ''[[Freaks]]'' as well as the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series. Critics noted that the characters acted differently from the way they would in later seasons. In the UK, the BBC chose it as the first episode to be aired when they started showing the series.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season1/page4.shtml}}</ref>

==Plot==
[[Homer Simpson|Homer]] takes his family to the company picnic at the expansive estate of his boss, [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]], who fires any employee whose family members are not enjoying themselves. Homer sees that Burns is drawn towards a family that treats one another with love and respect and tells his family to behave themselves. However, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] run wild on the grounds, and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] gets drunk on the alcoholic punch. Homer laments his unruly family as they leave the picnic.

Homer tells everyone that he is going to turn them into a respectable family. He insists they sit at the dinner table to eat instead of the couch in front of the TV. When the rest of the family insist that they aren't really so bad, Homer takes them on a walk around the neighborhood, where they see other families living in harmony, except for one family who mistake them for prowlers. Depressed, Homer goes to [[Moe's Tavern]], where he sees a commercial for [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Dr. Marvin Monroe|Dr. Marvin Monroe's]] Family Therapy Center. When he hears that Dr. Monroe guarantees "family bliss or double your money back," Homer immediately sets an appointment.

To pay for the expensive treatment, Homer spends the kids' college funds and [[pawnbroker|pawns]] the TV. Dr. Monroe attempts to engage the family in traditional treatments, but they seem untreatable. Dr. Monroe suggests a radical treatment, and hooks the family up to [[electrode]]s, telling them to send an electrical shock to each other when they feel upset, in the hopes that they will begin to associate hurtful behavior with the painful shocks. However, the family immediately begins shocking each other mercilessly, overloading the machine and causing the lights to dim (and shortly cause Springfield to lose power). Dr. Monroe unplugs the machine, admits that he cannot help the Simpsons, and gives them double their money back. Homer uses the money to purchase a better TV than the one they pawned, finally earning his family's love and respect.

==Production==
The episode shows telltale signs of being one of the earliest produced.<ref name="jean">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|date=2001|title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "There's No Disgrace Like Home"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref name="groening">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|date=2001|title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "There's No Disgrace Like Home"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The characters act completely differently to how they do in later seasons; Lisa, for example, is undisciplined and short-tempered, while Homer is the voice of reason; these roles are reversed in later episodes.<ref name="reiss">{{cite video | people=Reiss, Mike|date=2001|title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "There's No Disgrace Like Home"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

It was an early episode for [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]], who was voiced by [[Christopher Collins]] in the previous episode, "[[Homer's Odyssey (The Simpsons)|Homer's Odyssey]]". Originally, the character was influenced by [[Ronald Reagan]], a concept which was later dropped. The idea that he would greet his employees using index cards was inspired by the way Reagan would greet people.<ref name="reiss"/> The episode marks the first time Burns says "release the hounds".<ref name="jean"/>

It is also the first appearance of [[Dr. Marvin Monroe]] and [[Itchy & Scratchy]]; the latter had previously appeared in the [[The Simpsons shorts|shorts]].<ref name="BBC"/><ref name="jean"/>  The episode also marks the first appearance of [[List of recurring characters from The Simpsons#Eddie and Lou|Eddie and Lou]], although Lou is yellow instead of black, as he would later become. Lou was named after [[Lou Whitaker]], a former [[Major League Baseball]] player.<ref name="jean"/>

The idea behind the shock-therapy scene was based on [[Laurel and Hardy]] throwing pies at each other.<ref name="groening"/> The scene was rearranged in the editing room; it played out differently when first produced. The edits to this scene were preliminary, but well-received, and remained unchanged in the finished product.<ref name="groening"/>

==Cultural references==
The scene in which the family enters Burns' Manor contains two cultural references. The Manor resembles [[Charles Foster Kane]]'s mansion from the [[1941 in film|1941]] film ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.<ref name="BBC"/> The family refer to it as "stately Burns Manor", a reference to the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series.<ref name="jean"/> In addition, there is a reference to ''[[Freaks]]'', the [[Tod Browning]] [[cult film|cult]] [[horror film]], in the repetition of the line "one of us".<ref name="groening"/> When Marge gets drunk, she sings [[Dean Martin|Dean Martin's]] "[[Hey, Brother, Pour the Wine]]". The shock-therapy scene is reminiscent of the 1971 film ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''.<ref name="book"/>

==Reception==
The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, note: "It's very strange to see Homer pawning the TV set in an attempt to save the family; if this episode had come later Marge would surely have taken this stance." They continue, "A neat swipe at [[Family therapy|family counseling]] with some great set pieces; we're especially fond of the perfect version of the Simpsons and the electric-shock aversion therapy."<ref name="BBC"/> In a [[DVD]] review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 2.0/5.0, placing it as one of the worst of the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdbgproductions.com/cinerama/reviews/simpsonsseason1.htm|title=The Simpsons: The Complete First Season|accessdate=2008-01-14|year=2003|author=Grelck, David B|publisher=WDBG Productions}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In its original broadcast it finished 45th in the [[Nielsen ratings]] for the week.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nielsens|date=February 4, 1990|accessdate=2008-05-09|page=8|publisher=''[[Austin American-Statesman]]''|author=AP}}</ref>

This episode was one of the first seen by [[British people|British]] viewers.<ref name="BBC"/> It was the first episode to be broadcast on terrestrial television by the [[BBC]] on November 23, 1996 on a Saturday at 5:30pm, because the episodes were shown out of order. The episode was screened with five million viewers, slightly less than the show, ''[[Dad's Army]]'', which previously held the timeslot. The episode also faced competition from [[ITV]]'s screening of ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/comedy/simpsons/bbc.htm|title=THAT IS SO 1991!
