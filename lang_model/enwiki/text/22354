The '''Transportation Worker Identification Credential''' (or '''TWIC''') program is a [[Transportation Security Administration]] and [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] initiative in the [[United States]]. The TWIC program provides a tamper-resistant biometric credential to maritime workers requiring unescorted access to secure areas of port facilities, outer continental shelf facilities, and vessels regulated under the [[Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002]], or MTSA, and all U.S. Coast Guard [[Merchant Mariner Credential|credentialed]] [[United States Merchant Marine|merchant mariners]]. An estimated 750,000 individuals will require TWICs. Enrollment and issuance will take place over an 18 month period. Those seeking unescorted access to secure areas aboard affected vessels, and all Coast Guard credentialed merchant mariners must possess a TWIC by September 25, 2008.[http://dmses.dot.gov/docimages/pdf100/444554_web.pdf] To obtain a TWIC, an individual must provide biographic and biometric information such as fingerprints, sit for a digital photograph and successfully pass a security threat assessment conducted by TSA.

==Maritime Sector==

While TWIC may be implemented across other transportation modes in the future, the TWIC Final Rule, published in the [[Federal Register]] on January 25, 2007, sets forth regulatory requirements to implement this program in the maritime mode first.

The program's goals are:

*Positively identify authorized individuals who require unescorted access to secure areas of the nation's maritime transportation system;
*Determine the eligibility of an individual to be authorized unescorted access to secure areas of the maritime transportation system;
*Enhance security by ensuring that unauthorized individuals are denied unescorted access to secure areas of the nation's maritime transportation system; and,
*Identify individuals who fail to maintain their eligibility qualifications after being permitted unescorted access to secure areas of the nation's maritime transportation system and revoke the individual's permissions.

==Rollout issues==
The [[Government Accountability Office]] has said the TWIC program has suffered from lack of oversight and poor coordination.  Supporters of the program say TWIC card production could be delayed until issues with shipboard card readers are resolved. Alternatively, TWIC cards now in use would have to be reprogrammed with new applications, requireing cardholders to visit enrollment centers a second time.
