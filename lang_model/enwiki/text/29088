'''King's Highway 402''', commonly referred to as '''Highway 402''' and historically as the '''Blue Water Bridge Approach''', is a [[400-series highways|400-series highway]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]] that connects the [[Blue Water Bridge]] international crossing near [[Sarnia]] to [[Highway 401]] in [[London, Ontario|London]]. It is one of two vital trade links between Ontario and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] [[United States]]. The [[Controlled-access highway|controlled access]] freeway is four-laned for nearly its entire length, except on the approach to the Blue Water Bridge, where it widens.

Although Highway&nbsp;402 was one of the original 400-series highways when it was designated in 1953, it was not completed until 1982, when the final link between [[Ontario Highway 81|Highway&nbsp;81]] and [[Ontario Highway 2|Highway&nbsp;2]] opened to traffic. The freeway originally did not exit the Sarnia city limits, and merged into [[Ontario Highway 7|Highway&nbsp;7]] near the present [[Ontario Highway 40|Highway&nbsp;40]] interchange. In 1972, construction began to extend Highway&nbsp;402 between Sarnia and London; this work was carried out over a decade. The removal of an intersection at Front Street in Sarnia made the entire route a controlled-access highway.

Motorists crossing into [[Michigan]] at the western end have direct access to [[Interstate 69 in Michigan|Interstate 69]] (I-69) and [[Interstate 94 in Michigan|Interstate 94]] (I-94) into [[Port Huron, MI|Port Huron]]; motorists crossing onto the Canadian side from the east end of I-69 and I-94 have access to [[Toronto]] via Highway&nbsp;401, and onwards to [[Montreal]] via [[Quebec Autoroute 20|A-20]] in [[Quebec]]. The only town along Highway&nbsp;402 between Sarnia and London is [[Strathroy, Ontario|Strathroy]].

== History ==
Planning for the route that would become Highway&nbsp;402 began following the completion of the Blue Water Bridge in 1938. A divided highway was constructed through Sarnia following [[World War II]]; it was completed and designated in 1953.<ref name="Christina heritage" /> The Department of Highways announced its intent to extend the route to Highway&nbsp;401 in 1957.<ref name="intent" /> However, while some preliminary work began in the early 1960s, it would take until 1968 for a preferred route to be announced,<ref name="official" /> and until 1972 for construction to begin.<ref name="begin" /> Work was carried out through the remainder of the 1970s, and the freeway was completed and ceremonially opened in late 1982.<ref name="ceremony" /> Since completion as a four-lane route, expansion work has been concentrated on the portion of the freeway in Sarnia approaching the border crossing.<ref name="widening" />

Highway&nbsp;402 is one of the original 400-series highways. It was numbered in 1953, a year after [[Ontario Highway 400|Highway&nbsp;400]] and Highway&nbsp;401.<ref name="Christina heritage">{{cite report

As such, the highway was named the Blue Water Bridge Approach. Construction began in 1939. However, like many other road projects, World War II halted construction. In 1947, a new survey was undertaken; construction resumed by 1952. The approach road was opened in 1953, at which point the route was designated Highway&nbsp;402. It featured an interchange with Christina Street and [[at-grade]] intersections with Front Street, Indian Road and Modeland Road (the [[Ontario Highway 40|Highway&nbsp;40]] Sarnia bypass).<ref name="Christina heritage" />

Ultimately, Highway&nbsp;402 was designated with the intent of extending it to Highway&nbsp;401. This was formally announced by the Department of Highways in late 1957.<ref name="intent">{{cite news

It was decided to construct the extension on a new [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]], as had been done with most freeways constructed after Highway 400. East of the Murphy Road overpass, Highway&nbsp;402 was re-aligned to bypass the interchange with Highway&nbsp;40 constructed in 1964; Exmouth Street was redirected to connect with Highway&nbsp;7 (London Line) at that junction, and Quinn Street now follows the former route of the highway.<ref>{{Google maps

For the new Highway&nbsp;402, an overpass crossing was required with the then-[[Canadian National Railway|CNR]] line (now the Howard Watson Nature Trail) and an interchange with the newly [[twinning (roads)|twinned]] Highway&nbsp;40 just north of the 1964 interchange.

On January 5, 2013, a temporary vehicular [[blockade]] was created at the [[Blue Water Bridge]] as part of the "Idle No More" protests by [[First Nations]] groups.  The blockade was known in advance and was planned to occur during the noon hour. Lambton [[Ontario Provincial Police|OPP]] monitored the protest by walking alongside the protestors.  Traffic resumed flowing normally by 1:30 p.m.  While Highway 402 itself was not closed, the protest did back up traffic onto the highway causing congestion in the areas of Front Street and Christina Street.<ref>{{cite news

Later that year, another protest was held west of Strathroy on October&nbsp;19, advocating against wind turbine construction due to the health effects experienced by those living near them. The rolling protest of about 150 vehicles, including farm equipment, was monitored by the OPP and required intermittent ramp closures to the westbound lanes.<ref>{{cite news
