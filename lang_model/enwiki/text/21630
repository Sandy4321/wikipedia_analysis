'''Aert van den Bossche''' (also known as '''Aert Panhedel''', or by his own 1505 signature: ''Harnoult van den Boske''),<ref name="NAi" /> was a [[Early Netherlandish Painting|Early Netherlandish painter]], active in [[Brussels]] and [[Bruges]] in the late 15th Century. He was a member of the Bruges painters' [[Guild of Saint Luke]] (named after [[Luke the Evangelist]], the [[patron saint]] of all artists). Bossche had registered himself by name in its [[annals]] in the year 1505.<ref name="NAi" />

== Life ==
Little is known about the life of Aert van den Bossche. He is recorded to have painted in Brussels in 1499 as ''"Aert van Panhedel alias van den Bossche, schilder"''.<ref name="NAi"/> The document implies that Aert Panhedel was from the town of [['s-Hertogenbosch]] colloquialy referred to as Den Bosch (hense ''den Bossche'').<ref name="NAi"/>  It is also known that Aert's father, the painter Yanne van den Bossche, had received some orders from the Brussels {{nobreak|shoe-makers'}} guild as well. Aert van der Bossche had a son Gielis, a.k.a. [[Gielis Panhedel]] ([[:nl:Gielis Panhedel|nl]]) signed ''Gilken van den Booeske'', who was also an accomplished painter.<ref name="NAi">{{cite book| oclc=| quote= we need to mention the painters Aert and Gielis van den Bossche alias (van) Panhedel. His father, Aert van den Bossche, had already worked in Brussels in 1490, and is recorded there in 1499 as `Aert van Panhedel alias van den Bossche, schilder' (painter). (...) In 1505, Aert Panhedel also registered in the Bruges painters' guild under the name 'Harnoult van den Boske'. The same entry states that he had a 15-year-old son called `Gilken van den Booeske'.  | publisher=NAi Publishers|location= Rotterdam | title=Hieronymus Bosch.

The authorship of some paintings now attributed to Aert van den Bossche has been disputed for years by scholars, including the famous ''Virgin and Child in a Landscape'', {{nobreak|c. 1492-1498}} unsigned, on view at the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]];<ref name="artsconnected">{{cite web | url=http://www.artsconnected.org/resource/1100/virgin-and-child-in-a-landscape | title=Master of the Embroidered Foliage, Netherlandish, active 1480 - 1500 | publisher=Minneapolis Institute of Arts | work=Artist(s) Unknown, possibly Master of the Madonna Grog or Aert van den Bossche, formerly Master of the Embroidered Foliage | date=February 28, 2009 | accessdate=February 28, 2013 | author=Collection Minneapolis Institute of Arts | quote=Gift of the Groves Foundation.

The only written proof of a specific artwork commissioned from him personally is a receipt of 1490 of the [[remuneration]] paid by the Brussels shoemakers' guild for the triptych, the ''Martyrdom of Christian Saints [[Crispin and Crispinian]]'', the patron saints of cobblers and leather workers.<ref name="rkd.nl"/> The saints were born to a noble Roman family as twin brothers in the 3rd century AD. They were allegedly persecuted, tortured and put to death for their faith by [[Rictus Varus]] in [[Belgic Gaul]].<ref name="cathency">{{CathEncy|wstitle=Sts. Crispin and Crispinian |first=Gabriel |last=Meier}}</ref>  The discovery of this receipt led to the identification of the so-called "Master of the Legend of St. Barbara" with Aert van den Bossche.<ref name="rkd.nl"/>

== Martyrdom of Saints Crispin and Crispinian ==
The long-unidentified ''martyrdom'' [[triptych]] did not survive in its original form. In the early 19th century, the central part (or the largest middle panel) of the triptych was purchased in [[St. Petersburg]] from private hands by Count [[Aleksander Stanis<U+0142>aw Potocki|Stanis<U+0142>aw Potocki]], [[Master of the Horse]] (''Konyushy'') at the court of the Russian Tsar during the foreign [[Partitions of Poland]].<ref name="wilanow-palac">{{cite web | url=http://www.wilanow-palac.pl/aleksander_potocki.html | title=Aleksander Potocki | publisher=Muzeum Pa<U+0142>ac w Wilanowie | work=Polski S<U+0142>ownik Biograficzny | accessdate=February 28, 2013 | author=Palace Museum in Wilan<U+00F3>w | language=English}}</ref> It was put on display at his [[Wilan<U+00F3>w Palace]] adapted into an art centre by Potocki himself. Unlike other Polish nobles at the time, Potocki did not take part in the [[November Uprising]] against Russia.<ref name="wilanow-palac" />

For over a hundred years since the last verified purchase, it was not known what the painting depicts.<ref name="polskieradio" /> Speculations included the ''[[Ten thousand martyrs]]'' among other themes [[Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand|known already]] from [[Albrecht D<U+00FC>rer|D<U+00FC>rer]]. However, the truth was finally deducted by [[Jan Bia<U+0142>ostocki]] ([[:pl:Jan Bia<U+0142>ostocki|pl]]) from the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], professor of the [[Warsaw University]] and one-time curator at the National Muzeum in Warsaw. Some 13 plants were identified in the painting, most of them used in leather [[tanning]]. The shoemakers' guild was a "connective tissue" in his subject-matter analysis.<ref name="polskieradio">{{cite web | url=http://www.polskieradio.pl/8/406/Artykul/749774,Straszliwa-smierc-swietych-braci | title=Straszliwa <U+015B>mier<U+0107> <U+015B>wi<U+0119>tych braci | publisher=[[Polskie Radio]] S.A | work=Obraz niderlandzkiego malarza, o kt<U+00F3>rym opowiedzieli<U+015B>my w Dw<U+00F3>jce, przedstawia m<U+0119>cze<U+0144>stwo Kryspina i Kryspinina <U+2013> rzymskich szewc<U+00F3>w, kt<U+00F3>rzy zas<U+0142>yn<U+0119>li dobroci<U+0105> i mi<U+0142>osierdziem | date=22.12.2012 | accessdate=March 1, 2013 | author=Micha<U+0142> Montowski, interview with dr Gra<U+017C>yna Bastek | language=Polish | quote=The painting of a Danish master revealed to show the Martyrdom of Saints Crispin and Crispinian <U+2013> two Roman cobblers famous for their compassion and goodness.}}</ref> The written record confirms that the masterpiece was donated by the guild as an altar to St. Nicholas Church, next to the [[Brussels Stock Exchange|Bourse]], in Brussels to secure their own prosperity.<ref name="codart.nl">{{cite web | url=http://www.codart.nl/exhibitions/details/2871/ | title=Painting in Brussels 1450-1520 | publisher=Codart.nl Exhibitions | work=Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels | date=2013 | accessdate=March 1, 2013 | author=International network for curators of art from the Low Countries.}}</ref> The subject matter had to be related.
