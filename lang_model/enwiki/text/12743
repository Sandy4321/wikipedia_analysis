'''State Road 878''' ('''SR 878'''), named the '''Snapper Creek Expressway''' for its entire length, is a {{convert|2.7|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} east&ndash;west [[open road tolling|electronic toll road]] south of [[Miami]], [[Florida]]. The expressway is named for the nearby [[Snapper Creek]] which runs parallel to SR 878. It acts as a [[spur route]] of the [[Florida State Road 874|Don Shula Expressway]] (SR 874), providing access to [[U.S. Route 1 (Florida)|U.S. Route 1]] (US 1) near [[South Miami, Florida|South Miami]] and local access to the eastern [[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]] area while bypassing the [[Dadeland]] district. The road is maintained and tolled by the [[Miami-Dade Expressway Authority]] (MDX).

[[Image:MetroPath_Snapper_Creek_bridge.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Metrorail (Miami)#MetroPath|MetroPath]] footbridge marks the entrance to SR 878 at its eastern terminus at US 1, near [[South Miami, Florida|South Miami]].]] SR 878's western terminus is integrated into the Don Shula Expressway's interchange with [[Florida State Road 94|Kendall Drive]] (SR 94) across the boundary of the Kendall and Sunset [[Census-designated place|districts]].<ref name="CensusMapFLMiDa85">{{cite map |url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/pl10map/cou_blk/st12_fl/c12086_miami-dade/PL10BLK_C12086_085.pdf |publisher=[[U.S. Census Bureau|U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, U.S. Census Bureau]] |title=P.L. 94-171 County Block Map (2010 Census): Miami-Dade County, FL |date=January 7, 2011 |cartography=U.S. Census Bureau Geography Division |at=Sheet 85 |accessdate=September 20, 2013}}</ref> Motorists entering the Don Shula Expressway northbound from Kendall Drive are given the option of continuing onto SR 874 via a [[overpass|flyover]], or else merging into the traffic leaving SR 874 for the Snapper Creek Expressway, which then heads under the Kendall Drive<U+2013>Don Shula Expressway flyover. The westbound lanes of SR 878, however, pass over SR 874's mainline, and are then given an exclusive carriageway beside the southbound lanes for {{convert|0.46|mi|km}}, before merging into SR 874 just north of the Kendall Drive overpass. Southbound motorists from the Don Shula Expressway wishing to exit to Kendall Drive merge into this carriageway before leaving for SR 94 with those vehicles originating from the Snapper Creek Expressway.<ref name="SLD1.1" /> There is no direct connection for southbound motorists on SR 874 to head east on SR 878; likewise, westbound motorists on SR 878 cannot head north along SR 874 directly.<ref name="Google Maps">{{Google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=FL-874+N&daddr=Snapper+Creek+Exd&geocode=FQkIiAEdmwA2-w%3BFb0MiAEdHK02-w&hl=en&mra=ls&sll=25.693078,-80.303578&sspn=0.004805,0.006899&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=14 |title=Map of Florida State Road 878 |accessdate=September 20, 2013}}</ref>

From here, SR 878 heads predominantly eastwards as a four-lane-wide expressway through residential neighborhoods for the remainder of its length, generally lying {{convert|0.5|mi|km}} north of Kendall Drive. After approximately {{convert|0.4|mi|km}}, the Snapper Creek Expressway passes through the 87th Avenue [[Open road tolling|toll gantry]].<ref name="Google Maps" /><ref name="tollschedule">{{cite web |url=http://www.mdxway.com/pdf/Toll_Rate_Schedule.pdf |title=Toll Rate Schedule |publisher=[[Miami-Dade Expressway Authority]] |date=July 1, 2013 |accessdate=September 20, 2013}}</ref> It then meets [[Florida State Road 973|Galloway Road]] (SR 973) shortly afterwards with a [[diamond interchange]].

About {{convert|0.3|mi|km}} east of the Palmetto Expressway, SR 878 has a partial diamond interchange with Southwest 72nd Avenue, which only allows westbound entry to and eastbound exit from the Snapper Creek Expressway. Immediately afterwards, SR 878 turns to the southeast and prepares to meet its eastern terminus at the South Dixie Highway (US 1) at a surface intersection {{convert|0.6|mi|km}} later, passing under the [[Metrorail (Miami)|Metrorail]] line and associated [[Metrorail (Miami)#MetroPath|MetroPath]] just before doing so. Traffic heading south along US 1 from eastbound SR 878 moves into a [[slip lane]], while that wishing to head north along US 1 enters it at an oblique angle, aided by traffic signals. The only access onto SR 878 westbound from US 1 is for southbound traffic; motorists heading north along US 1 are guided to SR 878 by signage along Southwest 67th Avenue and Southwest 80th Street.<ref name="SLD1" /><ref name="Google Maps" /><ref name="dademap">{{cite map |publisher=Florida Department of Transportation |title=General Highway Map Miami-Dade County, Florida |url=http://www.dot.state.fl.us/surveyingandmapping/geomap/mida_c.pdf |edition=May 2010 |year=April 2007 |cartography=Surveying and Mapping Office, State of Florida, Department of Transportation |accessdate=September 20, 2013}}</ref>

==Tolls==
SR 878's tolls are entirely [[Electronic toll collection|electronic]]: cash cannot be accepted along its length. Payment is done either via [[SunPass]] transponders or via toll-by-plate billing, the latter of which attracts a higher cost. Two toll gantries are located along the Snapper Creek Expressway, the first between the Don Shula Expressway and Galloway Road, and the second between Galloway Road and Southwest 72nd Avenue. The relationship between the tolling points and interchanges along SR 878 and SR 874 is that all motorists are charged at least one toll for using the road; there are no "free sections".<ref name="tollcard">{{cite web |url=http://www.mdxort.com/pdf/1740_MDXRateCard_874-878.pdf |title=Welcome to Open Road Tolling <U+2013> SR 874 Don Shula Expressway & SR 878 Snapper Creek Expressway |publisher=Miami-Dade Expressway Authority |accessdate=September 21, 2013}}</ref> As of July 1, 2013, the cost for a two-axle vehicle to travel the entire length of the Snapper Creek Expressway is $0.50 with a SunPass transponder, or $1.00 via the toll-by-plate program. Each additional axle on a vehicle attracts an extra $0.25 via SunPass or $0.50 via toll-by-plate for each toll gantry passed.<ref name="tollschedule" />

==History==
Planning by [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]] for a road named the "Snapper Creek Expressway" was underway as early as 1958, with a final completion date set as late as 1975.<ref name="1958plan">{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fyYzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=huoFAAAAIBAJ&dq=snapper%20creek%20expressway&pg=1347%2C2786005 |last=Einstein |first=Paul |title=Dade Maps 17-Year Road Program at Cost of 358 Million |newspaper=The Miami News |edition=Final Home Edition |date=February 7, 1958 |page=1A |accessdate=September 21, 2013}}</ref> Funding for SR 878's construction was made available in 1971 by the [[Florida Department of Transportation]] as part of plans to construct the Snapper Creek Expressway along with the South Dade Expressway (now known as the Don Shula Expressway) and the West Dade Expressway (now known as the [[Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike]]), with an expected completion date of early 1973.<ref name="1971plan">{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MsQlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FPQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1386%2C3923961 |last=Holland |first=Dick |title=X-Ways top list for funds |newspaper=The Miami News |edition=Afternoon |date=June 30, 1971 |page=5A |accessdate=September 21, 2013}}</ref> Construction was halted in 1974 due to money issued from county bonds for expressway building running out and the road was left partially completed;<ref name="1980open">{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VsslAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WPMFAAAAIBAJ&dq=snapper%20creek%20expressway&pg=1442%2C3367747 |last=Williams |first=Verne |title=Snapper Creek: U.S. 1-South Dade connection finally open |newspaper=The Miami News |edition=Metropolitan |date=March 19, 1980 |page=5A |accessdate=September 21, 2013}}</ref> however, $8 million in federal emergency funds was directed to completing the expressway in late 1977.<ref name="1977fund">{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nQk0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=1usFAAAAIBAJ&dq=snapper%20creek%20expressway&pg=1735%2C4391363 |title=Aqueduct won't suffer |newspaper=The Miami News |edition=Metropolitan |date=November 10, 1977 |page=5A |accessdate=September 21, 2013}}</ref> The Snapper Creek Expressway, designated SR 878, finally opened in early 1980, with the Southwest 72nd Avenue interchange opening a few weeks later.<ref name="1980open" />

No tolls were collected along SR 878 until [[Miami-Dade Expressway Authority|MDX]]'s initial roll-out of [[open road tolling]] from late 2009 to mid-2010 on its road network,<ref name="orthistory">{{cite web |url=http://www.mdxort.com/schedule0910.php?time=0 |title=Schedule 09/10 &#124; Miami-Dade Expressway ORT |publisher=Miami-Dade Expressway Authority |accessdate=September 21, 2013}}</ref> with tolling along the Snapper Creek Expressway beginning on July 17, 2010. The move to toll the Snapper Creek Expressway angered local residents, but was tempered by MDX's move to investigate toll rebates.<ref name="2010toll">{{cite news |url=http://www.mdxort.com/press/11.pdf |last=Chardy |first=Alfonso |title=Don Shula, Snapper Creek expressways to get electronic toll collection |newspaper=The Miami Herald |date=July 15, 2010 |publisher=Miami-Dade Expressway Authority |accessdate=September 21, 2013}}</ref> Initially, tolls were $0.25 for SunPass users, with a $0.15 surcharge for motorists using the toll-by-plate system.<ref name="tollcard" /> The toll-by-plate rate increased by ten cents on July 1, 2013 to $0.50 per toll gantry passed, while the SunPass rate was unaffected.<ref name="tollschedule" />
