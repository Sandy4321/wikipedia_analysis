The McCartneys became outspoken vegetarians and [[animal rights]] [[activist]]s.

As a strong advocate for animal rights, Linda lent her support to many organizations such as [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA), [[Campaign to Protect Rural England|The Council for the Protection of Rural England]] and [[Friends of the Earth]].
