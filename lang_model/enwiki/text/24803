This is a list of the '''extreme points of the [[United Kingdom]]''': the points that are farther [[north]], [[south]], [[east]] or [[west]] than any other location. Traditionally the extent of the [[island]] of [[Great Britain]] has stretched "from [[Land's End]] to [[John o' Groats]]" (that is, from the extreme [[Ordinal directions|southwest]] of [[England]] to the far [[Ordinal direction|northeast]] of [[Scotland]]).  

This article assumes that [[Rockall]] is included in the United Kingdom, although that claim is not recognised by any international authority and is disputed by some.  The [[Channel Islands]] are excluded as being a [[Crown dependency]] rather than a constitutional part of the United Kingdom.
