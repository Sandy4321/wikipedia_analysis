'''Acoma Pueblo''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|<U+00E6>|k|<U+0259>|m|<U+0259>}}; [[Keres language|Western Keresan]]: '''''Aa'ku'''''; [[Zuni language|Zuni]]: '''''Hakukya'''''; [[Navajo language|Navajo]]: '''''Haak<U+02BC>oh''''') is a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[pueblo]] approximately 60 miles west of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] in the [[United States]]. Three [[Indian reservation|reservations]] make up Acoma Pueblo: Sky City (Old Acoma), Acomita, and McCartys. The Acoma Pueblo tribe is a federally recognized tribal entity<ref name="Pritzker2000E"/>. The historical land of Acoma Pueblo totaled roughly 5 million acres; now only 10% of this land is in the hands of the community.<ref name="Pritzker2000A"/> According the 2010 United States Census, 4,989 people identified as Acoma.<ref name="Census1">U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000 Census 2000 American Indian and Alaska Native Summary File (AIANSF) - Sample Data, Acoma alone, H38</ref> The Acoma have continuously occupied the area for over 800 years<ref name="Pritzker2000D"/>, making it one of the oldest continuously inhabited communities in the United States.<ref name="NYT1"/> 

==Synonymy==

The word "Acoma" is from the Acoma and Spanish word ''Acoma'', or Ac<U+00FA>, which means "the place that always was" or "People of the White Rock". "Pueblo" is Spanish for "village". Pueblo refers to both the people and the unique architecture of the Southwest.<ref name="Pritzker2000A">{{cite book|author=Barry Pritzker|title=A Native American encyclopedia: history, culture, and peoples|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nQObO0Rzg1UC|accessdate=22 November 2011|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513897-9|page=6}}</ref>

==Language==

{{Main|Keresan language}}

The Acoma language falls in the [[Keresan language]] group.<ref name="Pritzker2000A"/> In Contemporary Acoma Pueblo culture, most people speak both Acoma and English. Elders might also speak Spanish.<ref name="Pritzker2000E"/>

==History==

===Origins and early history===

Pueblo people are believed to have descended [[Anasazi]], [[Mogollon culture|Mogollon]], and other ancient peoples. These influences are seen in the architecture, farming style and artistry of the Acoma. In the 1200s the Anasazi abandoned their canyon homelands due to climate change and social upheaval. For upwards of two centuries migrations occurred in the area, and Acoma Pueblo would emerge by the 13th century.<ref name="Pritzker2000A"/> This early founding date makes Acoma Pueblo one of the earliest continuously inhabited communities in the United States.<ref name="NYT1">{{cite web | author= | year=1992 | title=Lucy M. Lewis Dies; Self-Taught Potter, 93 | work=Obituaries | publisher=[[New York Times]] | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/26/obituaries/lucy-m-lewis-dies-self-taught-potter-93.html | accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="SI1">{{cite web | author=David Zax | year=2008 | title=Ancient Citadel  | work=Travel | publisher=[[Smithsonian Magazine]] | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/da-ancient-citadel.html | accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref>

The Pueblo lies on a 365-foot [[mesa]], about 60 miles west of Albuquerque, New Mexico. The isolation and location of the Pueblo has sheltered the community for over 1,200 years, seeking to avoid conflict with neighboring [[Navajos]] and [[Apaches]].<ref name="SI1"/> 

===European contact===

The Acoma Pueblo had contact with Spanish explorers heading north from Central America; all generally peaceful interactions.<ref name="SI1"/> [[Francisco V<U+00E1>squez de Coronado]]'s [[Francisco_V<U+00E1>squez_de_Coronado#Mounting_the_expedition|expedition]] described the Pueblo in 1540 as "one of the strongest places we have seen." Upon visiting the Pueblo the expedition "repented having gone up to the place." The only access to the Acoma Pueblo during this time was a set of almost vertical stairs cut into the rock face. It is believed Coronado's expedition was the first European contact with the Acoma.<ref name="SI1"/>  
[[Image:Ansel Adams - National Archives 79-AA-A03.jpg|thumb|right|Mission San Esteban Rey, ca. 1641, photo by [[Ansel Adams]], c.1941]]
[[Image:St Stephens Church at Acoma Pueblo.jpg|thumb|right|More recent view of the same building: architectural modifications are apparent.]]
By 1598, relationships with the Spaniards had declined. In December of that year, the Acoma heard that [[Juan_de_O<U+00F1>ate]] had intended on colonizing the area. The Acoma ambushed a group of O<U+00F1>ate's men, killing 11 of them, including O<U+00F1>ate's nephew. The Spanish took revenge on the Acoma, burning most of the village and killing over 600 people and imprisoning approximately 500 others. [[Prisoners of war]] were forced into [[slavery]] and men over 25 years old had their right foot [[amputation|amputated]]. A row of houses on the north side of the mesa still retain marks from the fire started by a cannon during the Acoma War.<ref name="SI1"/> 

Survivors of the [[Acoma Massacre]] would recover and rebuild their community and O<U+00F1>ate would proceed to force the Acoma and other local Indians to pay taxes in crops, cotton and labor. Spanish rule also brought [[Catholic missionaries]] into the area. The Spanish renamed the pueblos with the names of saints and started to construct churches at them. New crops were also introduced to the Acoma, including peaches, peppers and wheat. A [[royal decree]] in 1620 created civil offices in each pueblo, including Acoma, with a [[governor]] to go along with the office. In 1680 the [[Pueblo Revolt]] took place, with Acoma participating.<ref name="SI1"/> The revolt brought refugees from other pueblos. Those that eventually left Acoma would go on to form [[Laguna Pueblo]].<ref name="Laguna">{{cite web | author= | year= | title=Acoma | work=Pueblo | publisher=Holmes Anthropology Museum | url=http://www.holmes.anthropology.museum/southwestpottery/acomapueblo.html | accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref>

The Acoma would suffer from [[Smallpox_epidemics_in_the_Americas#Epidemics_in_the_Americas|smallpox epidemics]] and raiding from the Apache, [[Comanche]] and [[Ute people|Ute]]. On occasion, the Acoma would side with the Spanish to fight against nomadic tribes. The Acoma would proceed to practice their religion in secrecy. [[Intermarriage]] and intraction also became common between the Acoma, other pueblos and [[Hispanic]] villages. These communities would collide to form the [[Culture_of_New_Mexico#Culture|culture of New Mexico]].<ref name="Pritzker2000B"/> 

====San Esteban Del Rey Mission====

{{Main|San Estevan Del Rey Mission Church}}

Between 1629 and 1641 Father Juan Ramirez oversaw construction of the [[San Estevan Del Rey Mission Church]] church. The Acoma were ordered to build the church, moving 20,000 tons of adobe, straw, sandstone and mud to the mesa for the church walls. [[Ponderosa pine]] was brought in by community members from [[Mount Taylor (New Mexico)|Mount Taylor]], over 40 miles away. At 6,000-square-feet, with an altar flanked by 60-foot-high wood pillars handcarved in red and white designs representing Christian and Indigenous beliefs, the structure is considered a cultural treasure by the Acoma, despite the slave labor used to build it. In 1970 it was placed on the [[National_Trust_for_Historic_Preservation#National_Trust_Historic_Sites|National Register of Historic Places]]<ref name="nrhpinv2">{{Cite document|title={{PDFlink|[http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/70000417.pdf National Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings: San Estevan del Rey Mission Church (Acoma)]|32&nbsp;KB}}|date=April 30, 1968 |author=Charles W.

===19th and 20th century===

During the 19th century, the Acoma people, while trying to uphold traditional life, also adopted aspects of the once-rejected Spanish culture and religion. By the 1880s, railroads brought the pueblos out of isolation. In the 1920s, the [[All Indian Pueblo Council]] gathered for the first time in over 300 years. Responding to congressional interest in appropriating Pueblo lands, the [[U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Pueblo Lands Act]] in 1924. Despite successes in retaining their land, the 20th century proved culturally hard for the Acoma. [[Protestant]] missionaries and schools came into the area and the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] forced Acoma children into [[Native_American_education_and_boarding_schools|boarding schools]]. By 1922, most children from the community were in boarding schools.<ref name="Pritzker2000B">{{cite book|author=Barry Pritzker|title=A Native American encyclopedia: history, culture, and peoples|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nQObO0Rzg1UC|accessdate=22 November 2011|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513897-9|page=7}}</ref>

===Present day===

Today, about 300 two and three-story adobe buildings reside on the mesa, with exterior ladders used to access the upper levels where residents live. Access to the mesa is by a road blasted into the rock face during the 1950s. Approximately 30<ref name="Laguna"/> or so people live permanently on the mesa, with the population increasing on the weekends as family members come to visit and tourists, some 55,000 annually, visit for the day. Acoma Pueblo has no electricity, running water or sewage disposal<ref name="Laguna"/>. A reservation surrounds the mesa, totally 600-square-miles. Tribal members live both on the reservation and outside it.<ref name="SI1"/> However, contemporary Acoma culture remains relatively closed.<ref name="Pritzker2000E"/> According to the 2000 United States census, 4,989 people identify as Acoma.<ref name="Census1"/> 

To this today, many Acoma people disapprove of Juan de O<U+00F1>ate being called New Mexico's founder. In 1998, after a statue was erected as a tribute to O<U+00F1>ate at the [[O<U+00F1>ate Monument Center]] in [[Alcalde, New Mexico|Alcalde]], someone cut off the bronze statue's right foot with a [[chainsaw]].<ref name="SI1"/>

==Culture==

===Governance & reservation===
[[File:Acoma Pueblo Sky City.jpg|thumb|right|A view from the Acoma Pueblo mesa.]]
Acoma government was maintained by two individuals: a ''cacique'', or head of the Pueblo, and a war captain, both who would serve until their deaths. Both individuals maintained strong religious connections to their work, representing the [[theocracy]] of Acoma governance. The Spanish would eventually impose a group to oversee the Pueblo, but, their power was not taken seriously by the Acoma's matters. The Spanish group would work with external situations and comprised of a governor, two lieutenant governors, and a council. The Acoma also participated in the All Indian Pueblo Council, which started in 1598 and arose again in the 20th-century.<ref name="Pritzker2000C">{{cite book|author=Barry Pritzker|title=A Native American encyclopedia: history, culture, and peoples|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nQObO0Rzg1UC|accessdate=22 November 2011|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513897-9|pages=7<U+2013>8}}</ref>

Today, the Acoma maintain approximately 500,000 acres of their traditional land. Mesas, valleys, hills and [[arroyos]] dot the landscape which averages about 7,000 feet in altitude with about 10 inches of rain each year. Since 1977, the Acoma have acquired land through several land purchases, increasing their land base. On the reservation, only tribal members can own land and almost all enrolled members live on the property. The cacique is still active in the community, and is from the Antelope clan. The cacique appoints [[tribal council]] members, staff and the governor.<ref name="Pritzker2000E">{{cite book|author=Barry Pritzker|title=A Native American encyclopedia: history, culture, and peoples|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nQObO0Rzg1UC|accessdate=22 November 2011|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513897-9|pages=8<U+2013>9}}</ref>

In 2011 Acoma Pueblo and the [[Santa Clara Pueblo|Pueblo of Santa Clara]] were victims of heavy [[flooding]]. New Mexico supplied over $1 million to fund emergency preparedness and damage repair for victims and governor [[Susana Martinez]] requested additional funding from the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]].<ref name="Flood1">{{cite web | author=Shaun Griswold | year=2011 | title=Gov. Susana Martinez requests federal funding for flood victims | work= | publisher=[[KOB]] | url=http://www.kob.com/article/stories/S2369475.shtml?cat=517 | accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref>

===Warfare and weaponry===

Historically, engagements in warfare were common for Acoma, like other Pueblos. Weapons used included [[club (weapon)|clubs]], stones, spears and darts. The Acoma would go on to serve as [[auxiliaries]] for forces under Spain and Mexico, fighting against raids and protecting merchants on the Santa Fe Trail. After the 19th-century raiding tribes were less of a threat and Acoma military culture began to decline. The war captain position would eventually change to a civil and religious function.<ref name="Pritzker2000D"/>

===Architecture===
[[File:Acoma Pueblo - Wooden Ladders.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional wooden ladder on an dwelling. To the right is a set of stairs which is used to access the building in contemporary times.]]
Acoma Pueblo has three rows of three-story, apartment-style buildings which face south on top of the mesa. The buildings are constructed from [[adobe brick]] with beams across the roof that were covered with poles, brush and then plaster. The roof for one level would serve as the floor for another. Each level is connected by ladders, serving as a unique defensive aid; the ladders are the only way to enter the buildings, as the traditional design has no windows or doors. The lower levels of the buildings were used for storage. Baking ovens are outside the buildings, with water being collected from two natural [[cisterns]]. Acoma also has seven rectangular [[kivas]] and a village plaza which serves as the spiritual center for the village.<ref name="Pritzker2000C"/>

===Family life===

Traditional child raising involved very little discipline. Couples were generally [[monogamous]] and divorce was rare. Funerary rites involved ceremony and quick burial after death, followed by 4 days and nights of [[vigil]]. About 20 [[matrilineal]] clans were recognized by the Acoma. Education was overseen by kiva headmen who taught about human behavior, spirit and body, astrology, ethics, child psychology, [[oratory]], history, dance and music.<ref name="Pritzker2000D">{{cite book|author=Barry Pritzker|title=A Native American encyclopedia: history, culture, and peoples|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nQObO0Rzg1UC|accessdate=22 November 2011|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513897-9|page=8}}</ref> Horses would come to the Pueblo in the 17th century, introduced by the Spanish. Traditional clothing for men involved cotton [[kilt]]s and leather sandals. Women would wear cotton dresses and sandals or high [[moccasin]] boots. Rabbit and deer skin was used for clothing and robes, as well.<ref name="Pritzker2000D"/>

Since the 1970's Acoma Pueblo has retained control over education services, which have been keys in maintaining traditional and contemporary lifestyles. They share a high school with [[Laguna Pueblo]]. Alcoholism, drug use, and other health issues are prominent on the reservation and [[Indian Health Service]] hospitals and native healers cooperate to battle health problems. Alcohol is banned on the Pueblo<ref name="Casino1"/>. The nearest hospital is at Laguna Pueblo. Today, 19 clans still remain active.<ref name="Pritzker2000E"/>

===Religion===

Traditional Acoma religion stresses harmony between life and nature. The sun is a representative of the [[Creator deity]]. Mountains surrounding the community, the sun above and the earth below help to balance and define the Acoma world. Traditional religious ceremonies may revolve around the weather, including seeking to ensure healthy rainfall. The Acoma also use [[kachinas]] in rituals. The Pueblos also had one or more [[kivas]], which served as religious chambers. The leader of each Pueblo would serve as the community religious leader, or ''cacique''. The cacique would observe the sun and use it as a guide for scheduling ceremonies, some which were kept secret.<ref name="Pritzker2000B"/>

Many Acoma are [[Catholic]], but blend aspects of Catholicism and their traditional religion. Many old rituals are still performed.<ref name="Pritzker2000E"/> In September, the Acoma honor their [[patron saint]], [[Saint Stephen]]. For [[feast day]], the mesa is opened to the public for the celebration. Over 2,000 pilgrims attend the San Esteban Festival. The celebration beings at San Esteban Del Rey Mission and a carved pine [[effigy]] of Saint Stephen is removed from the altar and carried into the main plaza with people chanting, shooting rifles, and the ringing of [[steeple]] bells. The procession then proceeds past the cemetery, down narrow streets, and to the plaza. Upon arriving at the plaza, the effigy is placed in a [[shrine]] lined with woven blankets, which is guarded by two Acoma men. A celebration follows with dancing and feasting. During the festival vendors sell goods like traditional pottery and cuisine.<ref name="SI1"/>

===Subsistence===

Before contact with the Spanish, Acoma people ate corn, beans and squash, primarily. ''Mut-tze-nee'' was a popular thin [[corn bread]]. They also raised turkeys, tobacco and sunflowers. The Acoma hunted antelope, deer, and rabbits. Wild seeds, berries, nuts and other foods were gathered. After 1700 new foods are noted in the historical record. [[Blue corn]] drink, [[pudding]], [[corn mush]], corn balls, wheat cake, peach-bark drink, paper bread, flour bread, wild berries and [[Opuntia|prickly pear]] fruit all became staples. After contact with the Spanish, goats, horses, sheep and donkeys were raised.<ref name="Pritzker2000D"/> In contemporary Acoma, other foods are also popular such as apple pastries, corn [[tamale]]s, green-chili stew with lamb, fresh corn and wheat pudding with brown sugar.<ref name="SI1"/>

[[Irrigation]] techniques such as dams and terraces were used for agricultural purpose. Farming tools were made of wood and stone. Harvested corn would be ground with hands and [[mortar]].<ref name="Pritzker2000D"/>

===Economy===

Historical Acoma economic practices are described as [[socialistic]]. Labor was shared and produce was distributed equally. Trading networks were extensive, spreading thousands of miles throughout the region. During fixed times in the summer and fall trading fairs were held. The largest fair was held in [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] by the Comanche. Nomadic traders would exchange slaves, buckskins, buffalo hide, [[jerky]], and horses. Pueblo people would trade for copper and shell ornaments, [[macaw]] feathers, and [[turquoise]]. The Acoma would trade via the [[Santa Fe Trail]] starting in 1821, and with the arrival of railroads in the 1880s, the Acoma became dependent on American made goods. This dependency would cause traditional arts such as weaving and pottery making to decline.<ref name="Pritzker2000D"/>
[[File:Sky City Cultural Center, Acoma.jpg|thumb|right|The Sky City Cultural Center]]
Today, the Acoma produce a variety of goods for economic benefit. Agriculturally they grow [[alfalfa]], [[oats]], wheat, chilies, corn, melon, squash, vegetables and fruit. They raise cattle and have natural reserves of gas, [[geothermal]] and coal resources. [[Uranium mine]]s in the area provided work for the Acoma until their closings in the 1980s, after that, the tribe has provided most employment opportunities, however, high unemployment rates trouble the Pueblo. The legacy of the uranium mines have left [[radiation]] pollution, causing the tribal fishing lake to be drained and some health problems within the community.<ref name="Pritzker2000E"/>

====Tourism====

Tourism is a major source if income for the tribe.<ref name="Pritzker2000E"/> In 2008 Pueblo Acoma opened the [[Sky City Cultural Center and Haak'u Museum]] at the base of the mesa, replacing the original which was destroyed by fire in 2000. The center and museum seek to sustain and preserve Acoma culture. Films about Acoma history are shown and a cafe serves traditional foods. The architecture was inspired by pueblo design and Indigenous architectural traditions with wide doorways in the middle, which in traditional homes make the bringing of supplies easier, and flecks of [[mica]] are in the windowpanes, a mineral which mesa windows are made of. The complex is also fire resistant, unlike traditional pueblos, and they are painted light pinks and purples, to match the landscape surrounding it. Traditional Acoma artwork is exhibited and demonstrated at the Center, including ceramic [[chimneys]] crafted on the rooftop.<ref name="SI1"/> Arts and crafts also bring income into the community.<ref name="Pritzker2000E"/> 

Acoma Pueblo is open to the public by guided tour the majority of the year. Photography of the Pueblo and surrounding land is restricted. Tours and camera permits are purchased at the Sky City Cultural Center<ref name="Pritzker2000E"/>. While photography may be produced with permit, video recordings, drawings and sketching is prohibited.<ref>[http://www.frommers.com/destinations/print-narrative.cfm?destID=1583&catID=1583010002 "Acoma and Laguna Pueblos: Planning a Trip"], ''Frommers Guide''</ref>

The Acoma Pueblo also has a [[casino]] and hotel, the Sky City Casino Hotel. The casino and hotel are alcohol-free and is maintained by the Acoma Business Enterprise, which oversees most Acoma businesses.<ref name="Casino1">{{cite web | author=Neala Schwartzberg | year=2006 | title=Acoma Pueblo, Sky City Cultural Center and Haak'u Museum | work= | publisher=Offbeat Travel | url=http://www.offbeattravel.com/acoma-pueblo.html | accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref>

==Arts==
[[Image:Acoma seed pot.jpg|thumb|right|Acoma seed pot by B. Aragon. Traditionally seeds were stored inside pots like these, and the pots broken as needed.]]
At Acoma, pottery remains one of the most notable artforms. Men created weavings and silver jewelry, as well.<ref name="Pritzker2000D"/> 

===Acoma pottery===

Acoma pottery dates back to over 1,000 years ago. Dense local clay, dug up at a nearby site, is essential to Acoma pottery. The [[clay]] is dried and strengthened by the addition of pulverized pottery [[Sherd|shards]]. The pieces are then shaped, painted and fired. Geometric patterns, [[thunderbird]]s, and [[rainbows]] are traditional designs, which are applied with the spike of a [[yucca]]. Upon completion, a potter would lightly strike the side of the pot, and hold it to their ear. If it pot did not ring, then the pot cracked during firing. If this was found, the piece would be destroyed and ground into shards for future use.<ref name="SI1"/>
