'''Emilia Plater''' (Broel-Plater) (13 November 1806 <U+2013> 23 December 1831) was a [[Polish-Lithuanian (adjective)|Polish-Lithuanian]]<ref name="europeans"/><ref name="Russia, the non-Russian peoples of the Russian Federation, and the successor states of the Soviet Union"/> [[szlachta|noblewoman]] and revolutionary<ref name="international"/> from the lands of the [[partitions of Poland|partitioned]] [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. She fought in the [[November Uprising]] and is considered a national hero in [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Belarus]], which were former parts of the Commonwealth. She was venerated by a number of Polish artists as a symbol of women fighting for the Polish cause.

==Biography==
Emilia Plater was born in [[Vilnius]] (Wilno) into a [[szlachta|noble]] [[Polish-Lithuanian (adjective)|Polish-Lithuanian]] [[Plater family]] of the [[Plater coat of arms]].<ref name=lerski/> Her family traced its roots to [[Westphalia]], but was thoroughly [[Polonized]].<ref name="Heart of Europe">{{cite book|title=Heart of Europe|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yWi-WLvY_v0C&pg=PT248|accessdate=6 September 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-164713-0|pages=248<U+2013>249}}</ref> Originating in [[Westphalia]], much of the family relocated to [[Livonia]] during the 15th century and later to [[Lithuania]].<ref name="lerski"/> She is described by her nationality as either Polish, Polish-Lithuanian, Lithuanian<ref name="ethnologia"/> or by the place of her birth, as "from Lithuania".<ref name="genealogii"/><ref name="Zirin2007"/><ref name="LaFont1998"/> Her parents, [[Franciszek Ksawery Plater]] and [[Anna von der Mohl]], divorced when she was nine years old, in 1815.<ref name="psb652"/>

She was brought up by distant relatives, the [[Plater-Zyberk]] family, in their family's manor [[L<U+012B>ksna]] near [[Daugavpils]], contemporary [[Latvia]] ([[Inflanty]]).<ref name="psb652"/> Well-educated, Plater was brought up to appreciate the efforts of [[Tadeusz Ko<U+015B>ciuszko]], and the Prince [[J<U+00F3>zef Poniatowski]].<ref name="Berry1995"/> Emilia was fascinated by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], who she could read in the original German language. She was raised in an environment that valued the [[history of Poland]], and her literary heroes included [[Princess Wanda]] and [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s ''[[Gra<U+017C>yna (poem)|Gra<U+017C>yna]]''.<ref name="psb652"/> She also admired [[Laskarina Bouboulina|Bouboulina]], a woman who became one of the icons of the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek uprising against the Ottomans]],<ref name="psb652"/> a Polish fighter [[Anna Dorota Chrzanowska]],<ref name="psb652"/> as well as [[Joan of Arc]].<ref name="Berry1995"/> These pursuits were accompanied by an early interest in [[equestrianism]] and [[marksman]]ship, quite uncommon for early 19th century girls from aristocratic families.<ref name="psb652"/> She was also deeply interested in the [[Ruthenian]] (Belorussian) folk culture.<ref name="psb652"/> She had contacts and friends in the [[Filaret Association]].<ref name="psb652"/>

Painting by [[Wojciech Kossak]], oil on canvas.]][[File:Emilia Plater oswiadczenie.jpg|left|thumb|Statement of 25 March 1831, by Emilia Plater on joining the November Uprising.]]

In 1823 one of her cousins was forcibly conscripted into the [[Russian Army]] as a punishment for celebrating the [[Constitution of 3 May]]; this incident is said to be one of the key events in Emilia's life, and one that galvanized her pro-Polish and anti-Russian attitude.<ref name="Heart of Europe"/> In 1829, Emilia Plater began a [[grand tour]] throughout the historical [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], visiting [[Warsaw]] and [[Krak<U+00F3>w]], and the battlefield of [[Battle of Raszyn (1809)|Raszyn]]. Her mother died a year later; her father remarried and refused to even meet his daughter.<ref name="psb652"/> After the outbreak of the [[November Uprising]] against [[Imperial Russia]], she became a vocal supporter of the anti-Tsarist sentiments in the lands of the former [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].<ref name="psb652"/> She quickly became one of a dozen or so females to join the Uprising, and the most famous of them all.<ref name="psb652"/>

A document from 25 March contains her note that joining the uprising was her sole idea, and that she had hoped that such a moment would come her entire life.<ref name="psb652"/> She cut her hair, prepared a uniform for herself and organized and equipped a group of volunteers, speaking passionately after a mass on 29 March.<ref name="psb652"/> On 4 April she signed a document marking her access to the local uprising forces.<ref name="psb652"/> Her unit was composed of roughly 280 infantry, 60 cavalry and several hundred peasants armed with [[war scythe]]s.{{Cn|date=September 2012}}

From the area of [[Daugavpils]] (D<U+017A>wina) she entered [[Lithuania]], where in April 1831 her unit is rumored to have seized the town of [[Zarasai]], although the historians are not sure this event really occurred.<ref name="psb652"/> She planned to take Daugavpils, but after a reconnaissance mission discovered that the city was defended by a strong garrison and was impregnable to attack by such a small force as her own unit, that plan was abandoned.<ref name="psb652"/> She then returned to [[Samogitia]] and headed for [[Panev<U+0117><U+017E>ys]], where on 30 April she joined forces with the unit commanded by [[Karol Za<U+0142>uski]].<ref name="psb652"/> On May 4 she fought at the [[battle of Prestowiany]]; shortly afterwards, with [[Konstanty Parczewski]], she fought at [[Mai<U+0161>iagala]] (Mejszago<U+0142>a).<ref name="psb652"/> On 5 May she witnessed General [[Dezydery Ch<U+0142>apowski]] entering the area with a large force and taking command over all units fighting in the former Grand Duchy.<ref name="psb652"/>

Ch<U+0142>apowski advised Emilia Plater to stand down and return home. She allegedly replied that she had no intention of taking off her uniform until her fatherland was fully liberated. Her decision was accepted and she was made a (honorary, most likely) commanding officer of 1st company of the Polish-Lithuanian 25th Infantry Regiment.<ref name="psb652"/> She was promoted to the rank of [[Captain (land and air)|captain]],<ref name="Heart of Europe"/> the highest rank awarded to a woman at that time. She spent some time in [[Kaunas]] (Kowno), before the insurgents were forced to retreat from it in late June.<ref name="psb652"/>

After the Polish units were defeated by the Russians at [[<U+0160>iauliai]] (Szawle), Gen. Ch<U+0142>apowski decided to cross the border into [[Prussia]] and become interned there.<ref name="psb652"/> Emilia Plater vocally criticized that decision, refused to follow orders and instead decided to try to break through to Warsaw and continue the struggle.<ref name="psb652"/>

However, soon after separating from the main force, accompanied only by a two others, including her cousin (or uncle, sources vary), [[Cezary Plater]], she became seriously ill.<ref name="psb652"/> She never recovered, and she died on 23 December 1831 in a manor of the Ab<U+0142>amowicz family in [[Justinavas]] (Justiani<U+00F3>w).<ref name="psb652"/> She was buried in the small village of [[Kap<U+010D>iamiestis]] (Kopciowo) near [[Lazdijai]] (<U+0141>o<U+017A>dzieje).<ref name="psb653"/> After the defeat of the uprising, her estate was confiscated by the Russian authorities.<ref name="psb653"/>

==Legacy==
Her death was widely publicised shortly afterwards by the Polish press, which contributed to her growing fame.<ref name="psb653"/> Emilia Plater became one of the symbols of the uprising. The symbol of the fighting girl became quite widespread both in Poland, Lithuania and abroad. [[Adam Mickiewicz]] immortalized her in one of his poems, ''<U+015A>mier<U+0107> pu<U+0142>kownika'' (''Death of a Colonel''), although the description of her death is a pure poetical fiction and was only loosely based on her real life.<ref name="psb653"/><ref name="Berry1995"/> Mickiewicz has also idealized her personality and skills, portraying her as the ideal commander, worshiped by her soldiers.<ref name="psb653"/> That poem has entered the elementary [[curriculum]] in the independent Poland.<ref name="Berry1995"/>

Other literary works based on her life were published, mostly abroad, both by Polish emigres and by foreigners.<ref name="psb653"/> Among them were [[Georg B<U+00FC>chner]], [[Konstanty Gaszy<U+0144>ski]],<ref name="psb653"/> [[Wac<U+0142>aw G<U+0105>siorowski]],<ref name="psb653"/> [[Tadeusz Korczy<U+0144>ski]],<ref name="psb653"/> [[Antoni Edward Odyniec]]<ref name="psb653"/> and [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Buchner]]. [[J<U+00F3>zef Straszewicz]] most notably published three successive versions of her biography in French.<ref name="psb653"/>

She also became the theme of paintings by several artists of the epoch, among them [[Hyppolyte Bellange]], [[Achille Deveria]],<ref name="psb653"/> [[Philipp Veit]], [[Francois de Villain]] and [[Wojciech Kossak]].<ref name="psb653"/> In 1842 J. K. Salomo<U+0144>ski published a short biography of Emilia Plater in [[New York]], under the title of ''Emily Plater, The Polish Heroine; Life of the Countess Emily Plater''. A [[lithograph]] by F. De Villaine, based on Deveria's work, became one of the most recognizable portraits of her, popularizing her image as a delicate and noble female noble warrior.<ref name="psb653"/>

She was shown on the [[Second Polish Republic]]'s notes (20 [[zloty]]), and a Polish infantry regiment the [[Emilia Plater 1st Independent Women's Battalion]], was named after her.<ref name="psb653"/> During [[World War II]], a Polish female support unit, (''1 Samodzielny Battalion Kobiecy im. Emilii Plater'') in [[Polish 1st Tadeusz Ko<U+015B>ciuszko Infantry Division]] was named in her honor;<ref name="psb653"/> its former members founded a village ([[Plater<U+00F3>wka]]) in [[Lower Silesia]].<ref name="Cook2006">{{cite book|author=Bernard A. Cook|title=Women and War: A Historical Encyclopedia from Antiquity to the Present|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lyZYS_GxglIC&pg=PA476|accessdate=6 September 2012|date=1 May 2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-770-8|page=476}}</ref> Several streets in Poland are named after her, including [[Emilia Plater Street, Warsaw|one in Warsaw]].<ref name="psb653"/> In 1959 she was made the name-sake of a ship, the [[MS Emilia Plater|MS ''Emilia Plater'']]

Her life has also been a subject to studies from a [[feminist]] perspective, by scholars to point out the significance of her participation in the military conflict as a female going against the stereotype that only males can fight.<ref name="ChesterForrester1996">{{cite book|author1=Pamela Chester|author2=Sibelan Elizabeth S.

[[Stefan Kieniewicz]] in a more critical treatment in the [[Polish Biographical Dictionary]] notes that a lot of her exploits are poorly documented, and it is not always possible to separate legend from facts.<ref name="psb652"/> He notes it is not certain she ever commanded any unit, and that her role was more honorary than real; he also notes that she is known to have fainted on the battlefield, distracting her comrades, and in at least one instance (at the battle [[<U+0160>iauliai]]), she was purposefully held behind front lines, as her comrades tried to ensure she would not endanger herself.<ref name="psb652"/>
