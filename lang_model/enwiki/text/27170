== Background ==
While touring the [[United Kingdom]] in support of ''Take Care'', Drake announced in an interview that he had begun work on his third studio album.<ref name="UpdatesThird">{{cite web |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.19189/title.drake-updates-on-third-album-speaks-on-work-with-2-chainz-jamie-xx-noah-40-shebib|title=Drake Updates On Third Album, Speaks On Work With 2 Chainz, Jamie xx & Noah "40" Shebib|publisher=HipHopDX|accessdate=August 1, 2012}}</ref> In April 2012 Drake had stated that the album will have a different style and tempo than that of ''[[Take Care (album)|Take Care]]''.

On February 10, 2013, the night Drake won a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for [[Best Rap Album]] at the [[55th Grammy Awards]], he announced the title of his third album would be ''Nothing Was the Same''. During an interview with [[Ryan Seacrest]] on the red carpet, Drake told [[E!]], "I think music, it's a process we all go through," he said. "It's an evolution. You're constantly figuring out what works for you."<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.22872/title.drake-announces-title-of-third-album|title=Drake Announces Title Of Third Album|publisher=HipHopDX|accessdate=August 1, 2013}}</ref> He explained the difference between ''Nothing Was the Same'' and ''[[Take Care (album)|Take Care]]'' to ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' saying, <blockquote>"''Take Care'' was about connecting with my city and connecting with my past and sort of still feeling guilty that I<U+2019>m not in love with one of these girls that cared about me from back in the day.

Drake also said that [[Marvin Gaye]]'s 1978 double album ''[[Here My Dear|Here, My Dear]]'' had been a big influence on his current musical direction and he had been doing recording in Gaye's old studio "Marvin's Room".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/new-drake-song-on-my-way-surfaces-20130619|title=New Drake Song 'On My Way' Surfaces|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media LLC]]|accessdate=August 1, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/07/drake-nothing-was-the-same/marvin-gaye-influence |title=It's heavily influenced by Marvin Gaye's 1978 album Here, My Dear.

So I just want to sing the world's triumphs and problems on one record."<ref name="autogenerated6"/> In the same interview he explained more about the differences beween ''Nothing Was the Same'' and ''Take Care'' saying; "The music I'm making is more concise, more clear, I've been able to get my thoughts across a lot better on this album. Take Care is a great album but I listened to it and realized where I could do better and I think I've done better on this album."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/09/drake-says-nothing-was-the-same-is-better-than-take-care |title=Drake Says Nothing Was The Same Is Better Than Take Care |publisher=Complex |date=September 6, 2013 |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}</ref>

== Cover artwork ==
On August 21, 2013, Drake revealed the album's cover artwork was an oil painting by Southern California's [[Kadir Nelson]], the designer behind [[Michael Jackson]]'s posthumous album, ''[[Michael (Michael Jackson album)|Michael]]''. The two versions of the cover feature illustrations of profiles of Drake as a child, while the other shows the rapper as an adult. His younger self is adorned only with an [[afro]] comb in his hair, and his older self has a gold chain. Both covers are set against a blissful blue sky.<ref>{{cite web|author=By&nbsp;Erin Coulehan |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/drake-shares-cover-art-for-nothing-was-the-same-20130822 |title=Drake Shares Cover Art for 'Nothing Was the Same' &#124; Music News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date= |accessdate=August 25, 2013}}</ref> The cover artwork was compared to iconic hip hop albums [[Nas]]' ''[[Illmatic]]'', [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]'s ''[[Ready to Die]]'', and [[Lil Wayne]]'s ''[[Tha Carter III]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/art-design/2013/08/kadir-nelson-drake/ |title=Kadir Nelson Drake |publisher=Complex |date=June 15, 2013 |accessdate=August 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/08/xxl-discusses-drakes-new-cover/ |title=This Is What XXL Thinks Of Drake's New Cover - XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date= |accessdate=August 25, 2013}}</ref> "What that album art is to me, is the fact that this is my most clear, concise thoughts from now, and my best recollection of then", Drake explained. Both covers will be available side by side in stores, so consumers may choose which one they want.<ref>{{cite web|author=8/26/13 |url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/949860/drake-explains-nothing-was-the-same-album-art.jhtml#id=1713036 |title=Drake Explains Nothing Was The Same Album Art &#124; News Video |publisher=MTV |date=August 29, 2013 |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}</ref>

The artist, Kadir Nelson told MTV, "Drake wanted a signature painting, he didn't want something that looked like a hip-hop album cover. He wanted something that was a little bit more artsy and had more weight to it, so I did a number of sketches, and when we picked out what he liked, I sculpted it together." He said he listed to Drake's music in the studio to gain inspiration and he also gave Drake a full sized painting of the album cover.<ref>{{cite web|last=Alexis |first=Nadeska |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1712858/drake-kadir-nelson-nothing-was-the-same-cover.jhtml |title=Drake's Nothing Was The Same Cover Explained! - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV.com |date=August 22, 2013 |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}</ref>

''Nothing Was the Same'' was met with generally positive reviews from [[music criticism|music critic]]s. Simon Vozick-Levinson of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the album four out of five stars, saying "Drake reveals so much of himself on ''Nothing Was the Same'' that it's easy to poke holes in his tortured-player persona: After a while, his confessions start to sound like sneaky boasts about all the beautiful hearts he's broken. And maybe he wants you to see that contradiction. After all, hiding his flaws has never been Drake's style <U+2013> they're the whole point."<ref name="rollingstone2"/> Elysa Gardner of ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the album three out of four stars, saying "On his latest album Canada's leading hip-hop export continues to juggle bravado with brooding, though he sounds more empowered in the latter."<ref name="usatoday1"/>
