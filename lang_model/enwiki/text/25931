'''Fort Firelands''' is a recreation of an [[nineteenth century|1800s]]-style [[frontier]] [[fort]] located in [[Lakeside, Ohio|Lakeside]]-[[Marblehead, Ohio|Marblehead]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]].  It was built in 1968 and includes stockade fencing, corner blockhouses with gun ports, and barracks were included in the original construction.  A pioneer village and early western-style museum were some of the original attractions. Today, what remains of the original structures are being repaired and rehabilitated. An RV Resort is located behind the fort complex. 

Renewed interest in the unique, neo-historical structure is being shown and events are again to be held in the fort complex. Several postcards were issued that illustrate the initial construction.
