 |OriginalAirDate=[[January 13]] [[2008]]
 |ShortSummary=Astral is contacted by [[Rental Magica#Others (magic related)|Kei Isurugi]], a member of the school of ''[[Onmy<U+014D>d<U+014D>]]'' that Nekoyashiki once attended, to perform a ceremony at a mountain. Itsuki accompanies Nekoyashiki and Mikan, but they are attacked by Kei during the ceremony. Kei remarks that he lost his sister, [[Rental Magica#Others (magic related)|Sakuya Isurugi]] during a similar ceremony three years prior because Nekoyashiki left the school at the time to take Mikan to Astral. Nekoyashiki challenges Kei to a personal duel, and Itsuki upholds this, stopping the arriving Honami and Adelicia from interfering. Despite Kei's use of ''[[kuda-gitsune]]'', Nekoyashiki manages to defeat him, with Kei pleased that he was able to pose some level of challenge for Nekoyashiki, his idol at the school. As Kei lies in defeat, Nekoyashiki reminisces on his last experience with Sakuya as the group watches an [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] in the sky.

 |ShortSummary=Shinogi and Moroha Minagi request that the Astral members return a ''funadama'' they found to a shrine on a beach. When Itsuki and Kuroha attempt to return it, they are sucked into the past due to the magical pollution in the area. They meet a fisherman, Hy<U+014D>d<U+014D>, who explains that he has been attempting to find a [[mermaid]] due to the miraculous healing abilities their flesh gives when it is consumed. In the present, Honami, Adelicia, Mikan, and Nekoyashiki are told the legend of the mermaids from an old woman, who recounts that mermaids return to eat those that consumed them. Itsuki and Kuroha are subsequently attacked, and Kuroha manages to call upon the spirit of Hy<U+014D>d<U+014D>'s wife, which materializes in a ''funadama'', causing the mermaids to chase after it instead, and Itsuki and Kuroha return to their own time. Later, Shinogi recounts that the shrine is being worshipped again, and Itsuki realizes it is likely one of Hy<U+014D>d<U+014D>'s descendants.

 |ShortSummary=Adelicia is forced by the Association to either appoint a new head of Goetia or get married to legitimize her claim. To resolve this, she offers a marriage proposal to Honami. She explains to a bewildered Itsuki that they will only be married as mages, which does not have the same weight as an actual marriage. With aid from Diana, Adelicia and Honami pick out the clothing and jewelry for their wedding while a disgruntled Itsuki accompanies them. At the marriage ceremony, Daphne administers the rites, but before the final stages are concluded, Itsuki takes both Adelicia and Honami and leaves the church. He explains to both of them that he realized that both did not have their hearts in the ceremony, and were doing it against their wishes. Adelicia subsequently contacts the Association to inform them that the marriage is canceled, and she and Honami throw their rings into the river, which Itsuki is later forced to retrieve.
