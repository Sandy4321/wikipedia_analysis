'''Kampfgeschwader 6''' (KG 6) (Battle Wing 6) was a Luftwaffe bomber unit during the [[Second World War]]. The unit was formed in between 1942. The unit operated the [[Dornier Do 217]] and [[Junkers Ju 188]] and [[Junkers Ju 88]] bombers.

==History==
While officially formed on or about the 1 September 1942 at [[Dinard]]/[[Brittany]] in northern France, the history of the ''Geschwader'' dates back to 11 October 1941. On that date the ''Luftwaffenfuhrungssab'' in Berlin ordered ''[[Luftflotte 3]]'' in Paris to form a ''Stab'' unit for a new ''Kampfgeschwader'' which was to cary the number 6. The new bomber formation was to comprise ''Kustenfliegergruppe 106'', ''Kampfgruppe 606'' and stab./Kustenfliegergruppe 406 with its subordinated ''staffeln''.<ref name="de Zeng ''et al'' Vol. 1 2007, p. 61.">de Zeng ''et al'' Vol. 1 2007, p. 61.</ref>
The first date that KG 6 is mentioned was 30 April 1942, when ''Luftflotte 3'' documents recorded its formation construction, at Dinard under ''[[Fliegerf<U+00FC>hrer Atlantik]]'' with noe aircraft or crews. On 3 June 1942 the new unit ''Geschwaderkommodore'' ''[[Oberstleutnant]]'' Joachim Hahn, former ''Kommandeur'' of ''Kampfgruppe 606'' was shot down by an [[Royal Air Force]] fighter in his [[Messerschmitt Bf 108]] near [[Dieppe]] and was killed.<ref name="de Zeng ''et al'' Vol. 1 2007, p. 61.">de Zeng ''et al'' Vol. 1 2007, p. 61.</ref> 
In August 1942 Berlin ordered a full ''Geschwader'' to be formed. It stated that the unit was to be a special bomber force and was to operate against key British industrial and energy targets as well as command and communication centres. To this end it was to have its own pathfinder capability.<ref name="de Zeng ''et al'' Vol. 1 2007, p. 61.">de Zeng ''et al'' Vol. 1 2007, p. 61.</ref>
