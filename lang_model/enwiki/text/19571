In 2004 [[Iran]] produced 5.1 percent of the world<U+2019>s total crude oil (3.9 million barrels per day), which generated revenues of US$25 billion to US$30 billion and was the country<U+2019>s primary source of [[foreign reserves|foreign currency]].<ref name=loc1/><ref>[http://www.irantradelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Irans-Foreign-Trade-Regime-Report.pdf Iran's Foreign Trade Regime Report]</ref> At 2006 levels of production, oil proceeds represented about 18.7 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). However, the importance of the [[hydrocarbon]] sector to [[Economy of Iran|Iran<U+2019>s economy]] has been far greater.

[[File:465700356 7224b8bd14 o.gif|thumb|left|Prime Minister [[Mosaddegh]] with U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]]]]

===The era of international control, 1901<U+2013>79===
The history of Iran<U+2019>s oil industry began in 1901, when [[United Kingdom|British]] speculator [[William Knox D'Arcy|William D<U+2019>Arcy]] received a concession from Iran to explore and develop southern Iran<U+2019>s oil resources. The discovery of oil in 1908 led to the formation in 1909 of the London-based [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company|Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC). By purchasing a majority of the company<U+2019>s shares in 1914, the British government gained direct control of the Iranian oil industry, which it would not relinquish for 37 years. After 1935 the APOC was called the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] (AIOC). A 60-year agreement signed in 1933 established a flat payment to Iran of four British pounds for every ton of crude oil exported and denied Iran any right to control oil exports.<ref name=loc1/>

In 1950 ongoing popular demand prompted a vote in the [[Majlis of Iran|Majlis]] to nationalize the petroleum industry. A year later, the government of Prime Minister [[Mohammad Mossadeq]] formed the [[National Iranian Oil Company]] (NIOC). [[1953 Iranian coup d'<U+00E9>tat|A 1953 coup d<U+2019><U+00E9>tat]] led by [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency|U.S. intelligence]] agencies ousted the Mossadeq government and paved the way for a new oil agreement.<ref>Kinzer, ''All the Shah's Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror'' (John Wiley & Sons, 2003), p.166</ref><ref>The Ford presidency: a history
 By Andrew Downer Crain, p.124</ref> In 1954 a new agreement divided profits equally between the NIOC and a multinational consortium that had replaced the AIOC. In 1973 Iran signed a new 20-year concession with the consortium.<ref name=loc1/>

Beginning in the late 1950s, many of Iran<U+2019>s international oil agreements did not produce the expected outcomes; even those oil companies that managed to extract oil in their designated areas contributed very little to the country<U+2019>s total oil production. By the time of the [[Islamic Revolution]] of 1978<U+2013>79, the five largest international companies that had agreements with the NIOC accounted for only 10.4 percent of total oil production.{{clarify|date=November 2010}} During this period, [[Industry of Iran#Oil, gas and petrochemicals|Iran<U+2019>s oil industry]] remained disconnected from other industries, particularly manufacturing. This separation promoted inefficiencies in [[Industry of Iran|the country<U+2019>s overall industrial economy]].<ref name=loc1/>
[[File:IRAN oil&gas production.jpg|thumb|Iran's oil & gas production since 1970.]]

===The era of nationalized oil, 1979<U+2013>===
Following the Revolution, the NIOC took control of Iran<U+2019>s petroleum industry and canceled Iran<U+2019>s international oil agreements. In 1980 the exploration, production, sale, and
export of oil were delegated to the [[Ministry of Petroleum (Iran)|Ministry of Petroleum]]. Initially Iran<U+2019>s post-revolutionary oil policy was based on foreign currency requirements and the long-term [[Environmental issues in Iran|preservation of the natural resource]]. Following the [[Iran<U+2013>Iraq War]], however, this policy was replaced by a more aggressive approach: maximizing exports and accelerating [[economic growth]]. From 1979 until 1998, Iran did not sign any oil agreements with foreign oil companies. Early in the first administration of President [[Mohammad Khatami]] (in office 1997<U+2013>2005), the government paid special attention to developing the country<U+2019>s oil and gas industry. Oil was defined as inter-generational capital and an indispensable foundation of [[Economic history of Iran#Review of Iran's successive economic plans (1991-2010)|economic development]]. Thus, between 1997 and 2004 Iran invested more than US$40 billion in expanding the capacity of existing oil fields and discovering and exploring new fields and deposits. These projects were financed either in the form of [[Foreign Direct Investment in Iran|joint investments with foreign companies]] or domestic contractors or through direct investment by the NIOC. In accordance with the law, foreign investment in oil discovery was possible only in the form of [[Foreign Direct Investment in Iran#Buy-Back|buyback agreements]] under which the NIOC was required to reimburse expenses and retain complete ownership of an oil field. Marketing of crude oil to potential buyers was managed by the NIOC and by a government enterprise called [[National Iranian Oil Company#Subsidiary Companies|Nicoo]]. Nicoo marketed Iranian oil to Africa, and the NIOC marketed to Asia and Europe.<ref name=loc1/>

==Oil production and reserves==
{{Main|National Iranian Oil Company|Oil reserves in Iran}}
[[File:Iran Petroleum Production.gif|right|thumb|Iran's Petroleum Production and Consumption (1976-2008)]]
Total oil production reached a peak level of 6.6 million bpd in 1976. By 1978, Iran had become the second-largest [[OPEC]] producer and exporter of crude oil and the fourth-largest producer in the world. After a lengthy decline in the 1980s, production of crude oil began to increase steadily in 1987. In 2008 Iran produced 3.9 million [[barrel per day]] (bpd) and exported 2.4 million bpd.<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Iran/Oil.html Energy Information Administration: Iran's entry] Retrieved November 21, 2010</ref> Accounting for 5 percent of world production, it returned to its previous position as OPEC<U+2019>s second-largest producer. According to estimates, in 2005 Iran had the capacity to produce 4.5 million bpd; it was believed that production capacity could increase to 5 million bpd by 2010, but only with a substantial increase in [[Foreign Direct Investment in Iran|foreign investment]]. Iran<U+2019>s long-term sustainable oil production rate is estimated at 3.8 million bpd.<ref name=loc1/>

In 2006 Iran reported crude oil reserves of 132.5 billion barrels, accounting for about 15 percent of OPEC<U+2019>s proven reserves and 11.4 percent of [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|world proven reserves]]. While the estimate of world crude oil reserves remained nearly steady between 2001 and 2006, at 1,154 billion barrels, the estimate of [[National Iranian Oil Company|Iran<U+2019>s oil reserves]] was revised upward by 32 percent when a [[NIOC Recent Discoveries|new field was discovered]] near [[Bushehr]]. Market value of Iran's total [[oil]] reserves at [[Price of petroleum|international crude price]] of $75 per barrel stands at ~US $10 trillion.<ref>{{cite web |work=IMFSurvey Magazine |title=Interview: ''Iran to Cut Oil Subsidies in Energy Reform'' |publisher=International Monetary Fund |date=September 28, 2010 |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2010/INT092810A.htm |accessdate=18 November 2010}}</ref>

In the early 2000s, leading international oil firms from [[China]], [[France]], [[India]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Russia]], [[Spain]], and the [[United Kingdom]] had agreements to develop [[National Iranian Oil Company|Iran<U+2019>s oil and gas fields]]. In 2004 China signed a major agreement to buy oil and gas from Iran, as well as to develop Iran<U+2019>s [[Yadavaran Field|Yadavaran oil field]]. The value of this contract was estimated at US$150 billion to US$200 billion over 25 years.<ref name=loc1/><ref>{{cite web |first=Marc |last= Wolfensberger |title=Iran Invites Sinopec Head to Sign $100 Billion Oil, Gas Deals |publisher=Bloomberg |date=November 25, 2006<!-- 05:57 EST -->|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&sid=aEGZ4sBCjHQE&refer=asia |accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> A more modest yet important agreement was signed with [[India]] to explore and produce oil and natural gas in southern Iran. In 2006 the rate of production decline was 8 percent for Iran<U+2019>s existing onshore oil fields (furnishing the majority of oil output) and 10 percent for existing offshore fields. Little exploration, upgrading, or establishment of new fields occurred in 2005<U+2013>6.<ref name=loc1/> However, the [[Iran-Libya Sanctions Act|threat of American retaliation]] kept the investment way below the desired levels.<ref>[http://www.treasury.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/programs/iran/iran.pdf US Department of the Treasury: An overview of O.F.A.C.

==Oil refining and consumption==
{{Main|National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company}}
[[File:Iran Oil Products.jpg|left|thumb|Iran's Refining Capacity (2007-2013).]]
In 2006 [[National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company#Installations and capabilities|Iran<U+2019>s refineries]] had a combined capacity of 1.64 million bpd. The largest refineries have the following capacities: Abadan, 400,000 bpd; Esfahan, 265,000 bpd; Bandar-e Abbas, 232,000 bpd; Tehran, 225,000 bpd; Arak, 150,000 bpd; and Tabriz, 112,000 bpd. In 2004 pipelines conveyed 69 percent of total refined products; trucks, 20 percent; rail, 7 percent; and tankers, 4 percent. Oil refining produces a wide range of oil products, such as [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG), [[gasoline]], [[kerosene]], [[fuel oil]], and [[lubricants]].<ref name=loc1/>

Between 1981 and 2004, domestic consumption of oil products increased from 0.6 million bpd to 1.1 million bpd<U+2014>an average annual growth rate of 2.6 percent. Most of this growth in consumption occurred between 1980 and 2001. Between 1981 and 2004, consumption of gasoline grew by 6 percent annually, but domestic production met only 75 percent of demand for this product. In 2004 the country imported US$1.6 billion worth of gasoline. By 2006 it imported 41 percent of its gasoline. Most imported gasoline is purchased at very high prices from the [[Middle East]] and [[Venezuela]]. Iran had invested between US$100 million and US$150 million to expand gasoline production to 42 million liters per day by 2007.<ref name=loc1/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/07/apr/1337.html |title=Foreign investment in Iran's oil industry up by 9.1 percent last year |publisher=Payvand.com |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Refining Status |publisher=NIORDC|url=http://en.niordc.ir/index.aspx?siteid=77&siteid=77&pageid=963 |accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref>

==Trade in oil and oil products==
{{See also|Iranian Oil Bourse|National Iranian Tanker Company}}
[[File:Iranoilandgas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ministry of Petroleum (Iran)#Revenues from crude oil|
Iran's projected oil and gas revenues]].]]
In 2006 exports of crude oil totaled 2.5 million bpd, or about 62.5 percent of the country<U+2019>s crude oil production. The direction of crude oil exports changed after the [[Iranian Revolution|Revolution]] because of the [[Iran-Libya Sanctions Act|U.S. trade embargo on Iran]] and the marketing strategy of the [[National Iranian Oil Company|NIOC]]. Initially, Iran<U+2019>s post-revolutionary crude oil export policy was based on foreign currency requirements and the need for long-term preservation of the natural resource. In addition, the government expanded oil trade with other developing countries. While the shares of Europe, Japan, and the United States declined from an average of 87 percent of oil exports before the Revolution to 52 percent in the early 2000s, the share of exports to East Asia (excluding Japan) increased significantly. In addition to crude oil exports, Iran exports oil products. In 2006 it exported 282,000 barrels of oil products, or about 21 percent of its total oil product output.<ref name=loc2>{{cite book |title= Iran, a country study |last= Kurtis|first= Glenn |authorlink= |coauthors= Eric Hooglund|year= |publisher= [[Library of Congress]] |location= Washington D.C. |isbn= 978<U+2013>0<U+2013>8444<U+2013>1187<U+2013>3|page= |pages= 163<U+2013>166|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/pdf/CS_Iran.pdf |accessdate= November 21, 2010}}{{PD-notice}}</ref> Iran plans to invest $500 billion in the oil sector until 2025.<ref name="nitc.co.ir"/>

==Natural gas==
{{Main|National Iranian Gas Company|Natural gas reserves in Iran}}
[[File:Iran-Pakistan-India.JPG|right|thumb|Projected [[Peace pipeline|Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline]].]]
In addition to the [[natural gas]] associated with oil exploration and extraction, an estimated 62 percent of Iran<U+2019>s 32.3 trillion cubic meters of proven natural gas reserves in 2006 were located in independent natural gas fields, an amount second only to those of Russia.<ref>{{cite web |title=Country Comparison:: Oil - proved reserves |work=The World Factbook |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2179rank.html?countryName=Iran&countryCode=ir&regionCode=me&rank=2#ir |accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> In 2006 annual production reached 105 billion cubic meters, with fastest growth occurring over the previous 15 years. In 2006 natural gas accounted for abut 50 percent of [[Energy in Iran|domestic energy consumption]], in part because domestic gas prices were heavily subsidized.<ref name=loc2/>

Since 1979, infrastructure investment by Iranian and foreign oil firms has increased pipeline capacity to support the Iranian gas industry. Between 1979 and 2003, pipelines to transport natural gas to refineries and to domestic consumers increased from 2,000 kilometers to 12,000 kilometers. In the same period, natural gas distribution pipelines increased from 2,000 kilometers to 45,000 kilometers in response to growing domestic consumption. Gas processing plants are located at Ahvaz, Dalan, Kangan, and Marun, in a corridor along the northern [[Persian Gulf]] close to the major gas fields. [[South Pars]], Iran<U+2019>s largest natural gas field, has received substantial foreign investment. With its output intended for both export and domestic consumption, South Pars is expected to reach full production in 2015. The output of South Pars is the basis of the [[Asalouyeh#PSEEZ|Pars Special Economic Energy Zone]], a complex of petrochemical and natural gas processing plants and port facilities established in 1998 on the Persian Gulf south of Kangan.<ref name=loc2/>

In the 1980s, Iran began to replace oil, coal, charcoal, and other fossil-fuel energy sources with natural gas, which is environmentally safer. The share of natural gas in household energy consumption, which averaged 54 percent in 2004, was projected to increase to 69 percent by 2009. Overall, natural gas consumption in Iran was expected to grow by more than 10 percent per annum between 2005 and 2009.<ref name=loc2/>

With international [[oil price]]s increasing and projected to continue increasing, international demand for natural gas and investment in production and transportation of natural gas to consumer markets both increased in the early 2000s. Iran set a goal of increasing its natural gas production capacity to 300 billion cubic meters by 2015 while keeping oil production stable.<ref>{{cite web|last=Marinho |first=Helder |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=ae.wXwOwwqQI |title=Iran Says It Is Ready for Foreign Energy Investment (Update2) |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}</ref> To achieve this capacity, the government has planned a joint investment worth US$100 billion in the oil and gas industry through 2015. In 2004 Iran signed a contract with France and Malaysia for production and export of natural gas and another agreement with European and Asian companies for expansion and marketing of its natural gas resources. In 2005 Iran exported natural gas to [[Turkey]] and was expected to expand its market to Armenia, China, Japan, other East Asian countries, India, Pakistan, and Europe. The first section of a new line to Armenia opened in spring 2007, as a much-discussed [[Peace pipeline|major pipeline to India and Pakistan]] remained in the negotiation stage.<ref name=loc2/>

[[File:CIAIranKarteOelGas.jpg|thumb|left|Iran holds 10% of the world's proven [[oil reserves]] and 15% of its [[gas]]. It is [[OPEC]]'s second largest exporter and the world's fourth oil producer.]]
Among some more recent deals, Switzerland<U+2019>s energy company EGL, signed a 25-year LNG export deal with Iran<U+2019>s National Iranian Gas Export Company on March 17, 2007, reportedly valued at 18 billion. [[Switzerland]] will buy 5.5 billion cubic meters of Iranian natural gas each year, beginning in 2011. In April 2007, [[OMV]], the [[Austria]]n partially state-owned energy company, signed letters of intent with Iran, worth an estimated $22.8 billion (22 billion euros), for Iran
to supply Europe with gas. The United States has expressed strong opposition to both the Swiss and Austrian deals with Iran.<ref name="Congress1">{{cite report |last= Ilias |first=Shayerah |year=2008 |title=Iran<U+2019>s Economy |publisher=Congressional Research Service |url=http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/107234.pdf|pages=17-18 }}{{PD-notice}}</ref>

The [[National Iranian Gas Company]] (NIGC) is expected to finalize a natural gas export deal with [[Pakistan]], with exports set to begin in 2011. The gas would be transported through a <U+201C>[[Peace pipeline]]<U+201D>, worth about $7.4 billion. The plan initially also included exporting gas to [[India]], but negotiations have stalled over pricing. Iran also is discussing a gas production and export deal with [[Turkey]]. Under the plan, Turkey would assist in developing Iran<U+2019>s South Pars field in exchange for cash or natural gas. Gas would be shipped from Iran to Turkey and Europe [[Persian pipeline|via a new pipeline]] that Turkey plans to build.<ref name="Congress1"/>

Other notable petroleum sector development deals include those with [[Russia]] and [[China]]. On February 19, 2008, Russian state gas company [[Gazprom]] announced a deal to establish a joint venture company to develop the offshore Iranian [[South Pars gas field]]. A [[China National Offshore Oil Corporation]] (CNOOC) investment deal, valued at $16 billion, to develop Iran<U+2019>s [[North Pars]] gas field and to build a [[liquid natural gas]] (LNG) plant, was supposed to be signed on February 27, 2008 but has been delayed.<ref>{{cite web|author=By BENO&#238;T FAUCON And SPENCER SWARTZ |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704216804575423212231718960.html |title=Iran Curbs LNG-Export Ambitions - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2010-08-12 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}</ref> The state-operated National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) and CNOOC signed a memorandum of understanding in December 2006 for the project, under which CNOOC would purchase 10 million metric tons per year of LNG for 25 years.<ref name="Congress1"/> Market value of Iran's total [[natural gas]] reserves at comparative international energy price of $75 per barrel of [[oil]] stands at ~US $4 trillion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Iran to Cut Oil Subsidies in Energy Reform |work=IMFSurvey Magazine |publisher=International Monetary Fund  |date=September 28, 2010 |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2010/INT092810A.htm |accessdate=21 November 2010}}</ref>

==Petrochemicals==
{{Main|National Iranian Petrochemical Company}}
In the early 2000s, an ambitious state [[petrochemicals]] project called for expansion of annual output in that industry from 9 million tons in 2001 to 100 million tons in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=212109 |title=Iran to build 46 new petchem units |publisher=Tehran Times |date=2010-01-13 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}</ref> Output capacity in 2006 was estimated at 15 million tons. The goal of this expansion is to increase the percentage of Iran<U+2019>s processed petroleum-based exports, which are more profitable than raw materials. In 2005 Iran exported US$1.8 billion of petrochemical products (about one-third of total nonoil exports in that year). Receiving 30 percent of Iran<U+2019>s petrochemical exports between them, [[China]] and [[India]] were the major trading partners in this industry. Iran<U+2019>s domestic resource base gives it a unique comparative advantage in producing petrochemicals when international crude oil prices rise. The gain has been greatest in those plants that use liquid gas as their main input. For FY 2006, the petrochemical industry<U+2019>s share of GDP was projected to be about 2 percent.<ref name=loc3>{{cite book |title= Iran, a country study |last= Kurtis|first= Glenn |authorlink= |coauthors= Eric Hooglund|year= |publisher= [[Library of Congress]] |location= Washington D.C. |isbn= 978<U+2013>0<U+2013>8444<U+2013>1187<U+2013>3|page= |pages= 166<U+2013>167|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/pdf/CS_Iran.pdf |accessdate= November 21, 2010}}{{PD-notice}}</ref> Iran plans to invest $500 billion in the oil sector until 2025.<ref name="nitc.co.ir"/> 

Iran<U+2019>s petrochemical industries have absorbed a large amount of private and public investment. In the early 2000s, 43 percent of these investments was financed by [[National Iranian Petrochemical Company|Iran<U+2019>s National Petrochemical Company]], a subsidiary of the [[Ministry of Petroleum of Iran|Ministry of Petroleum]], which administers the entire petrochemical sector. Another 53 percent is owned by foreign creditors (more than 100 foreign banks and foreign companies), 3 percent by banks, and 1 percent by the capital market. Most of the petrochemical industry<U+2019>s physical capital is imported, and the industry does not have strong backward linkages to manufacturing industries. In 2006 new petrochemical plants came online at [[Marun petrochemical complex|Marun]] and [[Asaluyeh]], and construction began on three others.<ref name=loc3/>
