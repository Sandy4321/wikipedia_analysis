It was later discovered that Prophet was not always in stasis after World War II, and had been used as "a mindless weapon of war" in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].<ref name="Wizard" /> Stephen Platt, ''Prophet'' artist from 1994 to 1996, explained that the character "feel[s] responsible for the things that people forced him to do, even though he can't remember them. He's always thought of himself as a good person, and now he's discovering that the things he did were hideous by all standards of human decency. He's going to [...] take a spiritual journey to discover who he really is." <ref name="Wizard" /> 

Despite his enhanced DNA and ability to communicate in all languages, Prophet was described as "very childlike" by Platt. "He doesn't know the social workings of the world that most of us take for granted: he can't hail a cab, and he eats ice cream too fast and gets a headache," Platt described to ''Wizard''.<ref name="Wizard" />

==Publication history==
===Creation and introduction (1992-2000)===
[[Rob Liefeld]] told ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine in 1994 that he was inspired by [[Gene Roddenberry]] and [[Steven Spielberg]] to create Prophet.<ref name="Wizard" /> The character first appeared in ''Youngblood'' #2, released by [[Image Comics]] in July 1992. Prophet was originally intended to appear in the pages of [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[X-Force]]''. Liefeld explained to ''Wizard'': "He was going to show up around #6 or #7 in my original plans, and the cover to ''Youngblood'' #2 originally had X-Force members looking on instead of Youngblood members. I soon decided that I was going to work on stuff that was creator-owned, so I pulled the character of Prophet and saved him for later."<ref name="Wizard" /> 

The storyline in ''Youngblood'' led directly into Prophet's own title, which lasted eleven issues (including a zero issue). A second series, written by [[Chuck Dixon]], premiered in 1995 and lasted eight issues. A [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] was released in 2000 by [[Awesome Comics]].

===Image revival (2012)===
[[Image:Prophet 21.jpeg|thumb|right|''Prophet'' #21 cover. Art by Marian Churchland.]]Image Comics announced at the 2011 [[New York Comic Con]] that Liefeld's line of Extreme Studios comics would return with the revival of five titles, including ''Prophet''. Written by [[Brandon Graham (comics)|Brandon Graham]] with art by Simon Roy, ''Prophet'' continued the numbering of the previous series and launched with issue #21 in January 2012.<ref name="Dietsch">

The book takes place approximately ten thousand years in the future. Graham said, "In the first issue, Prophet has to blend into an alien city and find his contract to get orders. The city is in a living spaceship that died after it landed and is slowly rotting. The aliens that live in it are a fermentation-based caste society. In the second issue, in order to cross a desert, Prophet joins an alien caravan where each of these giant alien beasts feeds off the waste of the creature in front of it until eventually the waste becomes a refined product that they go around selling. Prophet gets mixed up in an assassination plot of the caravans leader." Graham added that one of his main goals of the series is to "out '[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]]' the current run of '[[Conan (Dark Horse Comics)#Conan the Barbarian|Conan]]'".<ref name="Dietsch1">

''Prophet'' features a four-man rotation of artists: Roy, who drew the first three issues of the revival; Farel Dalrymple, who drew issues #24 and #25; Giannis Milonogiannis, who is illustrating six issues; and Graham, who drew issue #26.<ref name="Truitt" /> Each artist, Graham told [[Newsarama]], will focus on one main Prophet. "So when [Roy] returns on #32 he'll be drawing the same Prophet that he drew in his first issue. [Milonogiannis] will draw the old man Prophet's story and Farel Dalrymple is doing all the issues about the Prophet with a tail. I like the idea of each artist's style representing how the character they're drawing sees the world(s) around them."<ref name="Arrant">

====Critical reception====
In a review of ''Prophet'' #21, Newsarama's Scott Cederlund wrote that "Graham and Roy's revamping of an old Rob Liefeld character has a wild, untamed vibrancy that makes it more of a comic of today and not a rehash of a 15 year old concept that only lasted for under 20+ issues."<ref name="Cederlund">

Charles Hatfield of ''[[The Comics Journal]]'', in a review of issues #21 and #22, remarked that despite the book's "many obvious points of reference, Prophet casts its own spell, evoking its own fantastical reality."<ref name="Hatfield">

Oliver Sava of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' said that issue #26 "shows the stunning storytelling possibilities that arise when an established character is paired with an innovative creator." Sava added that "the main lesson that Marvel and DC can take away from the success of ''Prophet'' is that the best way to revitalize a property is by finding people who create good comics and allowing them to do whatever the hell they want with it."<ref name="Sava">
