'''Ludlow Castle''' is a ruined medieval fortification in the [[Ludlow|town of the same name]] in the English county of [[Shropshire]], standing on a [[promontory]] overlooking the [[River Teme]]. The castle was probably founded by [[Walter de Lacy (died 1085)|Walter de Lacy]] after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] and was one of the first stone castles to be built in England. During the [[The Anarchy|civil war]] of the 12th century the castle changed hands several times between the de Lacy's and rival claimants, and was further fortified with a [[keep|Great Tower]] and a large [[outer bailey]]. In the mid-13th century, Ludlow was passed on to [[Geoffrey de Geneville, 1st Baron Geneville|Geoffrey de Geneville]] who rebuilt part of the [[inner bailey]], and the castle played a part in the [[Second Barons' War]]. [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]] acquired the castle in 1301, further extending the internal complex of buildings, and the Mortimer family went on to hold Ludlow for over a century. 

[[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard]], the [[Duke of York]], inherited the castle in 1425, and it became an important symbol of [[Yorkist]] authority during the [[Wars of the Roses]]. When Richard's son, [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], seized the throne in 1461 it passed into the ownership of [[the Crown]]. Ludlow Castle was chosen as the seat of the [[Council in the Marches of Wales]], effectively acting as the capital of Wales, and it was extensively renovated during throughout the 16th century. By the 17th century the castle was luxuriously appointed, hosting cultural events such as the first performance of [[John Milton]]'s [[masque]] ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]''. Ludlow Castle was held by the [[Cavalier|Royalists]] during the [[English Civil War]] of the 1640s, until it was besieged and taken by a [[Roundheads|Parliamentarian]] army in 1646. The contents of the castle were sold off and a garrison was retained there for much of the [[Interregnum (1649<U+2013>1660)|interregnum]]. 

With the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration of 1660]], the Council was reestablished and the castle repaired, but Ludlow never recovered from the civil war years and when the Council was finally abolished in 1689 it fell into neglect. [[Henry Herbert, 1st Earl of Powis|Henry Herbert]], the [[Earl of Powis]], leased the property from the Crown in 1772, extensively landscaping the ruins, and his brother-in-law, [[Edward Clive, 1st Earl of Powis|Edward Clive]], bought the castle outright in 1811. A [[mansion]] was constructed in the outer bailey but the remainder of the castle was left largely untouched, attracting an increasing number of visitors and becoming a popular location for artists. After 1900, Ludlow Castle was cleared of vegetation and over the course of the century it was extensively repaired by the Powis Estate and government bodies. In the 21st century it is still owned by the Earl of Powis and operated as a tourist attraction.

The architecture of Ludlow reflects its long history, retaining a blend of several styles of building. The castle is approximately {{convert|500|by|435|ft}} in size, covering almost {{convert|5|acre}}. The outer bailey includes the Castle House building, now used by the Powis Estate as offices and accommodation, while the inner bailey, separated by a trench cut out of the stone, houses the Great Tower, Solar block, Great Hall and Great Chamber block, along with later 16th century additions, as well as a rare, circular chapel, modelled on the shrine in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]. [[English Heritage]] notes that the ruins represent "a remarkably complete multi-phase complex" and considers Ludlow to be "one of England's finest castle sites".

==History==
===11th century===
[[File:Ludlow Castle overlooking river.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Seen here across the [[River Teme]], the castle was built on a rocky [[promontory]].]]
Ludlow Castle was probably founded by [[Walter de Lacy (died 1085)|Walter de Lacy]] around 1075.<ref>{{harvnb|Renn|1987|pp=55<U+2013>58}}; {{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000a|pp=21}}</ref> Walter had arrived in England in 1066 as part of [[William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford|William fitzOsbern's]] household during the [[Norman conquest of England]].<ref name="a21">{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000a|p=21}}</ref> FitzOsbern was made the [[Earl of Hereford]] and tasked with settling the area; at the same time, several castles were founded in the west of the county, securing its border with Wales.<ref name="a21"/> Walter de Lacy was the earl's second in command, and was rewarded with 163&nbsp;[[manorialism|manors]] spread across seven counties, with 91 in Herefordshire alone.<ref name="a21"/> 

Walter began building a castle within the manor of [[Stanton Lacy]]; the fortification was originally called Dinham Castle, before it acquired its later name of Ludlow.<ref>{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000a|pp=21<U+2013>22}}</ref> Ludlow was the most important of Walter's castles: as well as being at the heart of his new estates, the site also lay at a strategic crossroads over the Teme River, on a strong defensive [[promontory]].<ref>{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000a|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Pounds|1994|p=69}} </ref> Walter died in a construction accident at Hereford in 1085 and was succeeded by his son, [[Roger de Lacy]].<ref>{{harvnb|Renn|1987|p=57}}</ref> 

The castle's [[Norman architecture|Norman]] stone fortifications were added possibly as early as the 1080s onwards, and were finished before 1115, based around what is now the [[inner bailey]] of the castle, forming a stone version of a [[ringwork]].<ref>{{harvnb|Renn|2000|pp=125<U+2013>126}}; {{harvnb|Goodall|2011|p=79}}; {{harvnb|Pounds|1994|p=11}}; {{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1291698 | | separator = ,| postscript =none | title=List Entry  | accessdate=26 November 2014 | publisher=English Heritage}}</ref> It had four towers and a [[gatehouse]] tower along the walls, with a ditch dug out of the rock along two sides, the excavated stone being reused for the building works, and would have been one of the very first masonry castles in England.<ref>{{harvnb|Renn|2000|pp=125<U+2013>126}}; {{harvnb|Goodall|2011|p=79}}; {{harvnb|Creighton|2012|p=83}}</ref> With its circular design and grand entrance tower, it has been likened to the earlier Anglo-Saxon ''[[Burh|burgheat]]'' designs.<ref>{{harvnb|Pounds|1994|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Liddiard|2005|pp=21<U+2013>22}}</ref> In 1096, Roger was stripped of his lands after rebelling against [[William II of England|William II]] and they were reassigned to Roger's brother, Hugh.<ref name="a22">{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000a|p=22}}</ref>

===12th century===
[[File:Ludlow Castle gatehouse, 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[keep|Great Tower]], constructed in the mid-12th century (centre), and the late-12th century entrance to the [[inner bailey]] (right)]]
Hugh de Lacy died childless around 1115, and [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] gave Ludlow Castle and most of the surrounding estates to Hugh's niece, [[Sybil (wife of Pain fitzJohn)|Sybil]], marrying her to [[Pain fitzJohn]], one of his household staff.<ref name="a22"/> Pain used Ludlow as his ''[[caput baroniae|caput]]'', the main castle in his estates, using the surrounding estates and [[knight's fee]]s to support the castle and its defences.<ref name="a25">{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000a|p=25}}</ref> Pain died in 1137 fighting the Welsh, triggering a struggle for the inheritance of the castle.<ref name="a25"/> [[Roger Fitzmiles, 2nd Earl of Hereford|Robert fitzMiles]], who had been planning to marry Pain's daughter, laid claim to it, as did [[Gilbert de Lacy]], Roger de Lacy's son.<ref>{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000a|pp=25<U+2013>26}}</ref> By now, King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] had seized the English throne, but his position was insecure and he therefore gave Ludlow to fitzMiles in 1137, in exchange for promises of future political support.<ref>{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000a|p=26}}</ref>

A [[the Anarchy|civil war]] between Stephen and the [[Empress Matilda]] soon broke out and Gilbert took his chance to rise up against Stephen, seizing Ludlow Castle.<ref>{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000a|pp=26<U+2013>27}}</ref> Stephen responded by taking an army into the [[Welsh Marches]], where he attempted to garner local support by marrying one of his knights, [[Josce de Dinan|Joce de Dinan]], to Sybil and granting the future ownership of the castle to them.<ref>{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000a|p=27}}</ref> Stephen took the castle after several attempts in 1139, famously rescuing his ally Prince [[Henry of Scotland]] when the latter was caught on a hook thrown over the walls by the garrison.<ref>{{harvnb|Renn|1987|p=55}}; {{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000a|p=28}}</ref> Gilbert still maintained that he was the rightful owner of Ludlow, however, and a private war ensued between Joce and himself.<ref>{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000a|pp=30<U+2013>33}}</ref> Gilbert was ultimately successful and retook the castle around a few years before the end of the civil war in 1153.<ref>{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000a|p=34}}</ref> He ultimately left for [[the Levant]], leaving Ludlow in the hands of firstly, his eldest son, Robert, and then, after Robert's death, his younger son, [[Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Hugh de Lacy]].<ref>{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000a|p=34}}; {{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000b|p=35}}</ref> 

During this period, the  Great Tower, a form of [[keep]], was constructed by converting the entrance tower, probably either around the time of the siege of 1139, or during the war between Gilbert and Joce.<ref>{{harvnb|Renn|2000|p=133}}</ref> The old Norman castle had also begun to become too small for a growing household and, probably between 1140 and 1177, an [[outer bailey]] was built to the south and east of the original castle, creating a large open space.<ref>{{harvnb|Renn|Shoesmith|2000|pp=191<U+2013>194}}</ref> In the process, the entrance to the castle shifted from the south to the east, to face the growing town of Ludlow.<ref>{{harvnb|Renn|Shoesmith|2000|p=191}}</ref> Gilbert probably built the circular chapel in the inner bailey, resembling the churches of the [[Templar order]] which he later joined.<ref>{{harvnb|Coppack|2000|p=150}}</ref>

Hugh took part in the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] and in 1172 was made Lord of Meath; he spent much time away from Ludlow, and [[Henry II of England|Henry&nbsp;II]] confiscated the castle in his absence, probably to ensure that Hugh stayed loyal while in Ireland.<ref name="b35">{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000b|p=35}}</ref> Hugh died in Ireland in 1186 and the castle passed to his son, [[Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Walter]], who was a minor and did not take charge of the property until 1194.<ref name="b35"/> During Prince [[John of England|John]]'s rebellion against [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] in 1194, Walter joined in the attacks against the prince; Richard did not approve of this and confiscated Ludlow and Walter's other properties.<ref name="b35"/> Walter de Lacy offered to buy back his land for 1,000&nbsp;[[Mark (money)|marks]], but the offer was rejected until in 1198 the vast sum of 3,100&nbsp;marks was finally agreed.<ref>{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000b|pp=35<U+2013>36}}</ref>{{efn|name=Medievalmoney|The medieval mark was worth two-thirds of an English pound; 400, 1,000 marks and 3,100 marks were the equivalent of <U+00A3>240, <U+00A3>666 and <U+00A3>2,066 respectively.

Walter de Lacy travelled to Ireland in 1201 and the following year his properties, including Ludlow Castle, were once again confiscated to ensure his loyalty and placed under the control of [[William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber|William de Braose]], his father-in-law.<ref>{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000b|p=36}}</ref> Walter's lands were returned to him, subject to the payment of a fine of 400&nbsp;marks, but in 1207 his disagreements with royal officials in Ireland led to King John seizing the castle and putting it under the control of William again.<ref name="b37">{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000b|p=37}}</ref>{{efn|name=Medievalmoney|The medieval mark was worth two-thirds of an English pound; 400, 1,000 marks and 3,100 marks were the equivalent of <U+00A3>240, <U+00A3>666 and <U+00A3>2,066 respectively.

In 1223, King [[Henry III of England|Henry&nbsp;III]] met with the Welsh prince [[Llywelyn ab Iorwerth]] at Ludlow Castle for peace talks, but the negotiations were unsuccessful.<ref name="b38"/> The same year Henry became suspicious of Walter's activities in Ireland and, among other measures to secure his loyalty, Ludlow Castle was taken over by [[the Crown]] for a period of two years.<ref>{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000b|p=39}}</ref> This was cut short in May 1225 when Walter carried out a campaign against Henry's enemies in Ireland and paid the King 3,000&nbsp;marks for the return of his castles and lands.<ref>{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000b|pp=38<U+2013>39}}</ref> During the 1230s, however, Walter had accumulated a thousand pounds of debt to Henry and private moneylenders which he was unable to repay.<ref name="b40">{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000b|p=40}}</ref> As a result, in 1238 he gave Ludlow Castle as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] to the King, although the fortification was returned to him sometime before his death in 1241.<ref name="b40"/>

Walter's grand-daughters [[Maud de Lacy, Baroness Geneville|Maud]] and Margaret were due to inherit Walter's remaining estates on his death, but they were still unmarried, making it hard for them to hold property in their own right.<ref name="b40"/> Henry informally divided the lands up between them, giving Ludlow to Maud and marrying her to one of his royal favourites, Peter de Geneva, cancelling many of the debts they had inherited from Walter at the same time.<ref>{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000b|pp=40<U+2013>42}}</ref> Peter died in 1249 and Maud married a second time, this time to [[Geoffrey de Geneville, 1st Baron Geneville|Geoffrey de Geneville]], a friend of the [[Edward I of England|Prince Edward]], the future king.<ref>{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000b|p=41}}</ref> In 1260, Henry officially split up Walter's estate, allowing Geoffrey to retain the castle.<ref>{{harvnb|Coplestone-Crow|2000b|p=42}}</ref>

Castle House in the outer bailey was leased to the diplomat [[Alexander Condie Stephen|Sir Alexander Stephen]] in 1901, who carried out extensive work on the property in 1904, extending and modernising the north end of the house, including constructing a [[billiard room]] and a library; he estimated the cost of the work to be around <U+00A3>800.<ref>{{harvnb|Lloyd|n.d.|pp=10<U+2013>11}}; {{harvnb|Shoesmith|2000c|p=220}}</ref> Castle House continued to be leased out by the Powis estate to wealthy individuals up until the [[Second World War]].<ref name="lloyd11">{{harvnb|Lloyd|n.d.|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Shoesmith|2000c|p=222}}</ref> One such lessee, Richard Henderson observed that he had spent around <U+00A3>4,000 maintaining and upgrading the property, and the rentable value of the property rose from <U+00A3>76 to <U+00A3>150 over the period.<ref name="lloyd11"/>{{efn|name=20thcenturymoney|<U+00A3>800 in 1904 would be worth between <U+00A3>86,000 and <U+00A3>673,000 in 2013 terms, depending on the financial measure used. <U+00A3>4,000 in 1928 would be worth between <U+00A3>630,000 and <U+00A3>1.4 million; <U+00A3>2,000 in 1945 would be worth between <U+00A3>230,000 and <U+00A3>320,000; <U+00A3>4,000 in 1956 would be worth between <U+00A3>81,000 and <U+00A3>300,000.<ref name=MeasuringWorth>{{cite web | url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/relativevalue.php | title=Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1270 to Present| author1 = Lawrence H.

==Architecture==
Ludlow Castle sits on a rocky promontory, overlooking the modern town of Ludlow on lower ground to the east, while the ground slopes steeply from the castle to the rivers [[River Corve|Corve]] and [[River Teme|Teme]] to the south and west, about {{convert|100|ft}} below.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|1877|p=166}}</ref> The castle is broadly rectangular in shape, and approximately {{convert|500|by|435|ft}} in size, covering almost {{convert|5|acre}} in total.<ref name=Hope1909P258>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|p=258}}</ref> The interior is divided into two main parts: an inner bailey which occupies the north-west corner and a much larger outer bailey.<ref name=Shoessmith15-6>{{harvnb|Shoesmith|2000a|p=15-16}}</ref> A third enclosure, known as the innermost bailey, was created in the early 13th&nbsp;century when walls were built to enclose the south-west corner of the inner ward.<ref>{{harvnb|Renn|2000|p=135}}; {{harvnb|Shoesmith|2000a|p=16}}</ref> The castle's walls are linked to Ludlow's medieval town wall circuit on the south and east sides.<ref name=Hope1909P258/> The castle is built from a range of different types of stone; the Norman stone work is constructed from greenish-grey [[siltstone]] rubble, with the [[ashlar]] and [[quoin]] features carved from [[red sandstone]], with the later work primarily using local red sandstone.<ref>{{harvnb|Renn|2000|p=126}}; {{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1291698 | | separator = ,| postscript =none | title=List Entry  | accessdate=26 November 2014 | publisher=English Heritage}}</ref> 

===Outer bailey===
[[File:Mortimer's Tower at Ludlow Castle.jpg|thumb|Mortimer's Tower with the towers of the inner bailey in the distance]]
The outer bailey is entered through a gatehouse; inside, the space within the curtain walls is divided into two. On the north side of the outer bailey is Castle House and its gardens; the house is a two-storeyed property, based around the old walls of the tennis court and the Castle Inn, and the curtain wall.<ref>{{harvnb|Shoesmith|2000c|pp=213, 227}}</ref> The north end of Castle House butts onto Beacon Tower, overlooking the town.<ref>{{harvnb|Shoesmith|2000c|p=213}}</ref>

The other half of the outer bailey houses the 16th-century porter's lodge, prison and stable block which run along its eastern edge.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|p=262}}; {{harvnb|Stone|2000|p=206}}</ref> The porter's lodge and prison comprise two buildings, {{convert|40|ft}} and {{convert|58|by|23|ft}} across, both two-storeyed and well built in ashlar stone, with a stable block on the far end, more crudely built in stone and {{convert|66|by|21|ft}} in size.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|pp=261<U+2013>262}}; {{harvnb|Stone|2000|p=206}}</ref> The exterior of the prison was originally decorated with the coats of arms of Henry, the Earl of Pembroke, and Queen Elizabeth I, but these have since been destroyed, as have the barred windows which once protected the property.<ref>{{harvnb|Stone|2000|p=208}}</ref>

Along the south of the bailey are the remains of St Peter's, a former 14th-century chapel, approximately {{convert|21|by|52|ft}} in size, later converted to a courthouse by the addition of an extension reaching up to the western [[Curtain wall (castle)|curtain wall]].<ref name="autogenerated263">{{harvnb|Hope|1909|pp=263<U+2013>264}}; {{harvnb|Remfry|Halliwell|2000|pp=202<U+2013>204}}</ref> The courtroom occupied the whole of the combined first floor with records kept in the rooms underneath.<ref name="autogenerated263"/> The south-west corner of the outer bailey is cut off by a modern wall from the rest of the bailey.<ref>{{harvnb|Remfry|Halliwell|2000|p=201}}</ref> 

The western curtain wall is approximately {{convert|6|ft|5|in|adj=on}} thick, and guarded by the 13th-century Mortimer's Tower, {{convert|18|ft}} across externally, with a ground floor [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] chamber inside, {{convert|12|ft|9.5|ft|adj=on}} large.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|pp=263, 265<U+2013>266}}</ref> When first built, Mortimer's Tower was a three storey gateway with an unusual D-shaped design, possibly similar to those at Trim Castle in Ireland, but in the 15th century the entrance way was blocked up to turn it into a conventional mural tower, and in the 16th century an additional internal floor was inserted.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|p=266}}; {{harvnb|Curnow|Kenyon|2000|pp=196, 199<U+2013>200}}</ref> The tower is now roofless, although it was roofed as late as the end of the 19th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Curnow|Kenyon|2000|p=198}}</ref>

===Inner bailey===

The inner bailey represents the extent of the original Norman castle and is protected by a curtain wall between {{convert|5|ft|adj=on}} and {{convert|6|ft|adj=on}} thick.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|p=267}}</ref> On the south and west sides the wall is protected by a ditch, originally up to {{convert|80|ft|adj=on}} deep, cut out of the rock and navigated by a bridge which still contains part of the ashlar stone of its 16th century predecessor.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|pp=259, 267}}</ref> Within the inner bailey, a separate area, called the innermost bailey, was created by the addition of a {{convert|5|ft|adj=on}} thick stone wall around the south-west corner in the early 13th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|p=301}}</ref> 

The gatehouse to the inner bailey has the coats of arms of Sir Henry Sidney and Queen Elizabeth I displayed over it, dating to 1581, and was originally a three-storeyed building with [[Transom (architectural)|transomed]] windows and fireplaces, probably used as the lodgings for the judges.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|pp=268<U+2013>269, 271}}</ref> There were probably additional heraldic supporters displayed alongside the arms, since lost.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleming|2000|p=187}}</ref> A porter's lodge would have been on the right hand side of the entrance to control access, with the rooms accessed by a [[spiral staircase]] in a protruding tower, with prominent triple chimneys, since lost.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleming|2000|pp=187<U+2013>180}}</ref> Alongside the gatehouse was originally a half-timbered building, possibly a laundry, approximately {{convert|48|by|15|ft}}, which has since been lost.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|p=271}}</ref>

On the east side of the bailey is the 12th-century chapel of Saint Mary Magdalene. The circular, [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] design of the chapel is unusual, with only three similar examples existing in England, at [[Castle Rising (castle)|Castle Rising]], [[Hereford Castle|Hereford]] and [[Pevensey Castle|Pevensey]].<ref>{{harvnb|Coppack|2000|p=145}}</ref> Built from sandstone, the circular design imitates the shrine at the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].<ref>{{harvnb|Coppack|2000|pp=147, 149<U+2013>150}}</ref> Originally the chapel had a [[nave]], a square [[Presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]], {{convert|3.8|by|3.8|m}} in size, and a [[chancel]], but this design was heavily altered in the 16th century and only the nave survives.<ref>{{harvnb|Coppack|2000|pp=145<U+2013>146, 151}}</ref> Although roofless, the nave survives to its full height and is {{convert|26|ft|3|in}} in diameter, visibly divided into two sections by different bands of stonework, and with some plaster surviving on the lower level.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|pp=271<U+2013>272}}; {{harvnb|Coppack|2000|p=145}}</ref> Around the inside of the nave are 14 [[Arcade (architecture)|arcaded]] bays in the walls.<ref>{{harvnb|Coppack|2000|p=148}}</ref>

The north end of the bailey is occupied by a range of buildings, the Solar block, the Great Hall and the Great Chamber block, with the Tudor Lodgings in the north-east corner. The Tudor Lodgings take the form of two [[rhomboid]]s to fit into the space provided by the [[curtain wall (castle)|curtain wall]], divided by a [[cross-wall]], the west side being approximately {{convert|33|by|15|ft}}, and the east side {{convert|33|by|21|ft}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|pp=295, 297}}</ref> They were entered by a shared spiral staircase, a design used in various episcopal palaces in the 16th century, and originally provided sets of individual offices and personal rooms for the court officials, later being converted into two distinct apartments.<ref>{{harvnb|Shoesmith|2000b|p=175}}</ref> 

The Great Chamber block adjoining the Tudor Lodgings dates from around 1320.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|p=288}}</ref> Another rhomboid design, approximately {{convert|53|by|34|ft}} across, this originally had its main chamber on the first floor, but has been much altered over the subsequent years.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|pp=288<U+2013>289}}</ref> The carved [[corbel]] heads that survive on the first floor may represent Edward II and Queen Isabella.<ref>{{harvnb|Thompson|2000|p=172}}</ref> Behind the Great Chamber block is the Guardrobe Tower, a four storeyed construction, providing a combination of bed chambers and guardrobes.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|p=294}}</ref>

In the 13th-century Great Hall, the hall itself was also positioned on the first floor, originally fitted with a wooden floor supported by stone pillars in the basement, and a massive wooden roof.<ref name="autogenerated276">{{harvnb|Hope|1909|pp=276, 279}}; {{harvnb|Thompson|2000|p=167}}</ref> It was {{convert|60|by|30|ft}} across: this 2:1 ratio between length and width was typical for castle halls of this period.<ref name="autogenerated276"/> The hall was reached by a flight of stone steps at the west end, and lit by three tall, trefoiled windows, each originally with its own window seat and south-facing to receive the sunlight.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|pp=276, 277<U+2013>279}}; {{harvnb|Thompson|2000|p=167}}</ref> Originally the hall had an open fire in the centre, which was normal for the 13th century, but the middle window was turned into a more modern fireplace around 1580.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|pp=277<U+2013>279}}; {{harvnb|Shoesmith|2000b|pp=180<U+2013>181}}</ref>

To the west of the Great Hall is the three-storeyed Solar block, an irregular oblong measuring up to {{convert|26|by|39|ft}} in size.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|pp=281<U+2013>283}}</ref> The first floor chamber would probably have been used as a solar, with the cellar being used as a service area.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|p=286}}</ref> The Great Hall and Solar block were built at the same time in the 13th century, the builders carving out the inside of the old Norman tower behind them in the process.<ref>{{harvnb|Morriss|2000|pp=155, 163<U+2013>166}}</ref> They were probably built in two phases and were originally intended to be smaller, less grand buildings, only for the design to be changed about half-way through construction; they were finished in a rushed manner, the traces of which can still be seen, along with other changes made in the 16th and 17th centuries.<ref>{{harvnb|Morriss|2000|pp=164<U+2013>166}}</ref>

[[File:Great Kitchen at Ludlow Castle.JPG|thumb|left|The Great Kitchen (right), in front of the innermost bailey, and the entrance to the inner bailey (left)]]
The North-West and North-East towers behind the northern range are Norman in origin, from the 11th and early 12th century. When first built, they were created by pushing or folding the line of the curtain wall outwards to create the desired external shape, and then adding timber floors and a timber wall at the back, rather than being designed as individual buildings.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodall|2011|p=79}}</ref> The timber parts of the towers were later replaced in stone, and incorporated into the later range of buildings. The North-East Tower, also known as the Pendover Tower, was originally two-storeys high, with a third floor added on in the 14th century, followed by an extensive remodelling of the inside in the 16th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|pp=298<U+2013>299}}; {{harvnb|Renn|2000|p=127}}</ref> It has [[chamfer]]ed angles on the external corners to make it harder to attack the stonework, although this has weakened the structural strength of the tower as a whole.<ref>{{harvnb|Renn|2000|p=127}}</ref> The North-West Tower had similar chamfered corners, but the Closet Tower was built alongside it in the 13th century, altering the external appearance.<ref>{{harvnb|Renn|2000|p=127}}; {{harvnb|Shoesmith|2000b|p=180}}</ref> Two more Norman towers survive in the innermost bailey, the West Tower, also known as the Postern Tower, because it contained a postern gate, and the South-West tower, also called the Oven Tower, on account of its cooking facilities.<ref>{{harvnb|Renn|2000|pp=128<U+2013>129}}</ref> The Norman towers looked out towards Wales, probably to make a symbolic statement.<ref>{{harvnb|Liddiard|2005|p=129}}</ref>

A range, now lost, once stretched from the innermost bailey towards the Great Hall, including a large stone house running along the curtain wall, {{convert|54|by|20|ft}} in size, and on the other side of the innermost bailey, the Great Kitchen, {{convert|31|by|23|ft}} in size, built around the same time as the Great Hall, and an oven building, since lost, {{convert|21|by|27|ft}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|pp=299<U+2013>301}}</ref> 

The Great Tower, or keep, is on the south side of the innermost bailey. A roughly square building, four storeys tall, most of its walls are {{convert|8|ft|6|in|adj=on}} thick, with the exception of its newer northern facing wall, only {{convert|7|ft|6|in|adj=on}} thick.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|p=306}}; {{harvnb|Renn|2000|p=133}}</ref> The Great Tower was constructed in several stages. Originally it was a relatively large gatehouse in the original Norman castle, probably with accommodation over the gateway, before being extended to form the Great Tower in the mid-12th century, although still being used as a gatehouse for the inner bailey.<ref>{{harvnb|Renn|2000|p=133}}; {{harvnb|White|2000|p=140}}</ref> When the innermost bailey was created in the early 13th century, the gateway was then filled in and a new gateway cut into the inner bailey wall just to the east of the Great Tower.<ref>{{harvnb|White|2000|pp=140}}</ref> Finally, the north side of the tower was rebuilt in the mid-15th century to produce the Great Tower that appears today.<ref>{{harvnb|Renn|2000|p=138}}</ref> The keep has a vaulted basement, {{convert|20|ft|adj=on}} high, with Norman wall arcading, and a row of windows along the first floor, since mostly blocked.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|p=305}}; {{harvnb|Renn|2000|p=136}}; {{harvnb|Creighton|2012|p=83}}</ref> The arcading echoes that in the chapel, and probably dates from around 1080.<ref>{{harvnb|Renn|2000|p=130}}</ref> The windows and large entrance-way would have looked impressive, but would also have been very hard to defend; this form of tower probably reflected earlier Anglo-Saxon high-status towers and was intended to display lordship.<ref>{{harvnb|Renn|2000|p=136}}; {{harvnb|Creighton|2012|pp=82<U+2013>83}}; {{harvnb|Liddiard|2005|pp=31<U+2013>32}}</ref> The first floor originally formed a tall hall, {{convert|29|by|17|ft}} across, which was subsequently subdivided into two separate floors.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope|1909|p=310}}</ref>
