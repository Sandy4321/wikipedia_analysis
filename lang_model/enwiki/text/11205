'''Buckwheat''' refers to plants in two genera of the [[dicot]] family [[Polygonaceae]]: the Eurasian genus ''[[Fagopyrum]]'', and the North American genus ''[[Eriogonum]]''. The crop plant, common buckwheat, is ''Fagopyrum esculentum''. [[Tartary Buckwheat|Tartary buckwheat]] (''F. tataricum'' Gaertn.) or "bitter buckwheat" is also used as a crop, but it is much less common. Despite the common name and the grain-like use of the crop, buckwheat is not a [[cereal]] or [[Poaceae|grass]]. It is called a [[pseudocereal]] to emphasize that it is not related to [[wheat]].

The agricultural weed known as [[Wild Buckwheat]] (''Fallopia convolvulus'') is in the same family, but not closely related to the crop species.
Within ''Fagopyrum'', the cultivated species are in the cymosum group, with ''F. cymosum'' L. (perennial buckwheat), ''F. giganteum'' and ''F. homotropicum''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=T. Sharma, S.

''F. homotropicum'' is interfertile with ''F. esculentum'' and the wild forms have a common distribution, in [[Yunnan]]. The wild ancestor of tartary buckwheat is ''F. tataricum'' ssp. ''potanini''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ohnishi, O., Matsuoka, Y.|year=1996|title=Search for the wild ancestor of buckwheat II.

== Etymology ==
The name "buckwheat" or "beech wheat" comes from its triangular seeds, which resemble the much larger seeds of the beech nut from the [[beech|beech tree]], and the fact that it is used like wheat. The etymology of the word is explained as partial translation of Middle Dutch ''boecweite'' : ''boek'', beech; see [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''bhago''- + ''weite'', wheat.<ref>http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=buckwheat Online Etymology Dictionary</ref>
It is also referred to "bleech wheat".

== History ==
[[Image:Fagopyrum esculentum1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Common Buckwheat in flower]]
Common buckwheat was domesticated and first cultivated in [[southeast Asia]], possibly around 6000 BC, and from there spread to Europe and to [[Central Asia]] and [[Tibet]]. Domestication most likely took place in the western Yunnan region of China.<ref>{{cite journal

}}</ref> Buckwheat is documented in Europe in the [[Balkans]] by at least the [[Middle Neolithic]] (circa 4000 BC) and the oldest known remains in China so far date to circa 2600 BC, and buckwheat pollen has been found in Japan from as early as 4000 BC. It is the world's highest elevation domesticate, being cultivated in [[Yunnan]] on the edge of the [[Tibetan Plateau]] or on the Plateau itself. Buckwheat was one of the earliest crops introduced by Europeans to North America. Dispersal around the globe was complete by 2006, when a variety developed in Canada was widely planted in China.

Buckwheat is a short season crop that does well on low-fertility or acidic soils, but the soil must be well drained. Too much fertilizer, especially nitrogen, will reduce yields. In hot climates, it can only be grown by sowing late in the season, so that it will bloom in cooler weather. The presence of [[pollinator]]s greatly increases the yield. The nectar from buckwheat flower makes a dark colored honey. Buckwheat is sometimes used as a [[green manure]], as a plant for [[erosion]] control, or as wildlife cover and feed.

== Agricultural production ==
[[Image:2006buckwheat.PNG|250px|thumb|right|Buckwheat output in 2006]]
Common buckwheat is by far the most important buckwheat species, economically, accounting for over 90% of the world's buckwheat production.

A century ago, [[Russia]] was the world leader in buckwheat production.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> In 1970 the [[Soviet Union]] grew an estimated 4.5 million acres (18,000&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of buckwheat. Then [[China]] has been the world's top producer until 2005, with Russia coming once again the top producer since 2007.

[[Ukraine]], [[France]], [[Poland]], [[Kazakhstan]], the [[United States]] and [[Brazil]] are also significant producers  of buckwheat. In the northeastern [[United States of America|United States]], buckwheat was a common crop in the 18th and 19th centuries. Cultivation declined sharply in the 20th century due the use of nitrogen fertilizer, to which maize and wheat respond strongly. Over a million acres (4,000&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) were harvested in the United States in 1918. By 1954 that had declined to 150,000 acres (600&nbsp;km<U+00B2>), and by 1964, the last year that production statistics were gathered, only 50,000 acres (200&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) were grown.

[[Japan]], [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], [[Latvia]], [[Bhutan]], [[Canada]], and [[Moldova]] also grow significant quantities of buckwheat, for the production of both food wheat and agricultural seed. Other producers of lower quantities include [[South Korea]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovenia]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[South Africa]], [[Croatia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], but they no longer produce the seed needed for their harvested areas.

The fruit is an [[achene]], similar to [[sunflower]] seed, with a single seed inside a hard outer hull. The starchy endosperm is white and makes up most or all of buckwheat flour. The seed coat is green or tan, which darkens buckwheat flour. The hull is dark brown or black, and some may be included in buckwheat flour as dark specks. The dark flour is known as "bl<U+00E9> noir" ("black wheat") in French, along with the name ''sarrasin'' ("saracen").

Soba noodles are the subject of deep cultural importance in Japan. In [[Korea]], [[guksu (dish)|guksu]] (noodles) were widely made from buckwheat before it was replaced by wheat.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} The difficulty of making noodles from flour that has no gluten has resulted in a traditional art developed around their manufacture by hand.

Buckwheat [[groats]] are commonly used in western [[Asia]] and eastern [[Europe]]. The porridge was common, and is often considered the definitive peasant dish. It is made from roasted groats that are cooked with broth to a texture similar to rice or [[bulgur]]. The dish was brought to America by [[Russians|Russian]] and [[Poles|Polish]] [[Jewish]] immigrants who called it "[[kasha]]" and mixed it with pasta or used it as a filling for [[knish]]es and [[blintz]]es, and hence buckwheat groats are most commonly called ''kasha'' in America.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} Groats were the most widely used form of buckwheat worldwide during the 20th century, with consumption primarily in Russia, Ukraine and Poland.

Buckwheat [[pancakes]], sometimes raised with [[yeast]], are eaten in several countries. They are known as buckwheat [[Blintz|blini]]s in [[Russia]], [[galette]]s in [[France]] (savoury  cr<U+00EA>pes which are especially associated with [[Brittany]]), [[ploye]]s in [[Acadia]] and ''bo<U+00FB>ketes'' (that is, named the same as the plant they are made of) in [[Wallonia]]. Similar pancakes were a common food in American pioneer days.{{Verify source|date=November 2008}} They are light and foamy. The buckwheat flour gives them an earthy, mildly mushroom-like taste. In Ukraine, yeast rolls called ''hrechanyky'' are made from buckwheat.

[[Farina]] made from groats are used for breakfast food, [[porridge]], and thickening materials in [[soup]]s, [[gravy|gravies]], and dressings. In [[Korea]], buckwheat [[starch]] is used to make a jelly called [[memilmuk]]. It is also used with [[wheat]], [[maize]] or [[rice]] in [[bread]] and [[pasta]] products.

and can thus be eaten by people with [[coeliac disease]] or gluten allergies. Many bread-like preparations have been developed. However, Buckwheat can be a potent and potentially fatal allergen by itself. In sensitive people, it provokes IgE-mediated anaphylaxis<ref>Anaphylaxis to buckwheat. Schiffner R, Przybilla B, Burgdorff T, Landthaler M, Stolz W. Allergy. 2001 Oct;56(10):1020-1. PMID: 11576091 </ref>. While this allergy is rare in the west, it is quite common in Japan and Korea<ref>Murine model of buckwheat allergy by intragastric sensitization with fresh buckwheat flour extract.

=== Upholstery filling ===

Buckwheat hulls are used as filling for a variety of [[upholstery|upholstered]] goods, including [[pillow]]s and [[zafu]]. The hulls are durable and do not conduct or reflect heat as much as synthetic fills. They are sometimes marketed as an alternative natural fill to feathers for those with allergies. However, medical studies to measure the health effects of buckwheat hull pillows concluded that buckwheat pillows do emit a potential allergen that may trigger asthma in susceptible individuals <ref>{{cite journal

=== Buckwheat and beer ===

In recent years, buckwheat has been used as a substitute for other grain in [[gluten free beer]]. Although it is not a [[cereal]], buckwheat can be used in the same way as [[barley]] to produce a [[malt]] that can form the basis of a [[mashing|mash]] that will brew a [[beer]] without [[gliadin]] or [[hordein]] (together [[gluten]]) and therefore can be suitable for [[coeliacs]] or others sensitive to certain [[glycoproteins]].<ref>{{cite web

=== Festivals ===
The buckwheat plant is celebrated in [[Kingwood, West Virginia]] at their [http://www.buckwheatfest.com Buckwheat Festival] where people can participate in swine, cow, and sheep judging contests, vegetable contests, and craft fairs. The area fire departments also play an important role in the series of parades that occur there. Each year there is a King and Lady Fireman elected. Also there are many rides and homemade, homegrown buckwheat cakes and sausage.

On Hindu fasting days ([[Navaratri]] mainly, also [[Maha Shivaratri]]), people eat items made of buckwheat flour. The preparation varies across [[India]]. The famous ones are [http://www.indobase.com/recipes/details/kuttu-ki-puri.php Kuttu Ki Puri] and [http://www.indobase.com/recipes/details/kuttu-ke-pakore.php Kuttu Pakoras]. In most of northern and western states they call this'' Kuttu ka atta ''.

== Biocontrol ==
Buckwheat is currently being researched, and actively used, as a pollen and nectar source to increase natural predator numbers to control crop pests in New Zealand<ref> http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118927753/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0</ref>

== Agricultural Use ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}
Buckwheat is raised for grain where a short season is available, either because it is used as a second crop in the season, or because the climate is limiting.

Buckwheat can be reliable cover crop in summer to fit a small slot of warm season for establishment.  It establishes quickly, which suppresses summer weeds.
