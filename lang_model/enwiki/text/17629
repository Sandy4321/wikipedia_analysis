'''Moritz Carri<U+00E8>re''' (March 5, 1817 in [[Griedel]] near [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]] <U+2013> January 19, 1895 in [[Munich]]) was a German [[philosopher]] and [[historian]].

After studying at [[University of Giessen|Giessen]], [[University of G<U+00F6>ttingen|G<U+00F6>ttingen]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], he spent a few years in [[Italy]] studying the fine arts, and established himself in 1842 at Giessen as a teacher of philosophy. In 1853 he was appointed professor at the [[university of M<U+00FC>nich]], where he lectured mainly on [[aesthetics]]. In the academy in Munich, he lectured on [[art history]].

He contributed in no small degree to making the idea of [[Germany|German]] unity more palatable to the South Germans. Carri<U+00E8>re identified himself with the school of the younger [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] as one who held the theistic view of the world which aimed at reconciling [[deism]] with [[pantheism]], and Christianity with science, art, and history, and who were opposed to [[ultramontanism]]. He urged the conversion of the [[cathedral of Cologne]] into a free church. Although no obstinate adherent of antiquated forms and prejudices, he firmly upheld the fundamental truths of [[Christianity]]. 

== Works ==
* ''Aesthetik'' ([[Leipzig]], 1859; 3rd ed., 1885), supplemented by 
** ''Die Kunst im Zusammenhang der Kulturentwicklung und der Ideale der Menschheit'' (3rd ed., 1877-1886) This is cited by some has his most celebrated work.
* ''Die philosophische Weltanschauung der Reformalionszeit'' ([[Stuttgart]], 1847; 2nd ed., Leipzig, 1886)
* ''Die sittliche Weltordnung'' (Leipzig, 1877; 2nd ed., 1891) Here he recognized both the immutability of the laws of nature and the freedom of the will. He described his view of the world and life as real-idealism. 

He translated the letters of [[H<U+00E9>loise and Abelard|Ab<U+00E9>lard and H<U+00E9>loise]] into German, and composed a poem on the last night of the [[Girondists]]. His essay on [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] (in ''Lebensskizzen'', 1890) develops his liberal ideas and may be considered his political confession of faith. He has prepared annotated editions of [[Goethe's Faust|Goethe's ''Faust'']] and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s [[Wilhelm Tell]]. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]], he delivered lectures on ''Die sittliche Weltordnung in den Zeichen und Aufgaben unserer Zeit'' (Munich, 1870), and on ''Deutsche Geisteshelden im Elsass ''(1871). His complete works were published at Leipzig, 14 vols., in 1886-1894.
