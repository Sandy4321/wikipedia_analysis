==Early career==
After he received his [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]], Tenet became research director of the American Hellenic Institute from 1978 to 1979.<ref>http://hellenicnews.com/readnews.html?newsid=1648&lang=US</ref> He then began working for the [[United States Senate|Senate]], first as a legislative assistant and later as Legislative Director to former Senator [[H. John Heinz III]] of [[Pennsylvania]] (1982-1985). He was a staff member of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] (SSCI) from 1985-1988, then Staff Director of the SSCI from 1988-1993. He had no military service.  Later, Tenet joined President-elect [[Bill Clinton]]'s national security transition team. Clinton appointed Tenet Senior Director for Intelligence Programs at the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (1993-95).<ref>http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2002-10-09-tenet_x.htm</ref><ref>http://www.militaryfactory.com/generals/george_tenet.asp</ref>

==CIA career==
Tenet was appointed [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director of Central Intelligence]] in July 1995. After [[John M. Deutch|John Deutch]]'s abrupt resignation in December 1996, Tenet served as acting director until he was officially appointed the position on [[July 11]], [[1997]], after a unanimous confirmation vote in the Senate. This was followed by the withdrawal of [[Anthony Lake]], whose nomination had been blocked by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in [[United States Congress|Congress]]. While the Director of Central Intelligence has typically been replaced by an incoming administration ever since [[Jimmy Carter]] replaced DCI [[George H. W. Bush]], Tenet served through the end of the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] and well into the term of [[George W. Bush]].

Bush]] in the [[Oval Office]] along [[White House]] [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] [[Andrew Card]] and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] (face not seen).]]

On [[September 15]], [[2001]], at [[Camp David]], Tenet presented the [[Worldwide Attack Matrix]], an outline of an [[War on Terrorism|anti-terrorism]] campaign in 80 countries. However, after the [[September 11 attacks]], many observers criticized the [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]] for numerous "intelligence failures" as one of the major reasons why the attacks were not prevented.<ref>http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/si/sept02/homeland.asp</ref>

===Tenet and Iraq WMD controversy===
According to a report by veteran [[Investigative journalism|investigative journalist]] [[Bob Woodward]] in his book ''[[Plan of Attack]]'', Tenet privately lent his personal authority to the intelligence reports about [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs) in [[Iraq]]. At a meeting on [[December 12]], [[2002]], he assured Bush that the evidence against [[Saddam Hussein]] amounted to a "[[slam dunk]] case" After several months of refusing to confirm this statement, Tenet later stated that this remark was taken out of context. (Tenet indicated that the comment was made pursuant to a discussion about how to convince the American people to support invading Iraq, and that, in his opinion, the best way to convince the people would be by explaining the dangers posed by Iraq's WMD i.e., the public relations sale of the war via the WMD, according to Tenet, would be a "slam dunk").<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/27/washington/27intel.html?ex=1335326400&en=e6f2a5232d75afb5&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss</ref> The search following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] by [[United States|U.S.]], [[United Kingdom|British]] and international forces yielded no stockpiles of WMDs, however.

===Resignation===
Citing "personal reasons," Tenet submitted his resignation to President Bush on [[June 3]], [[2004]]. [[James Pavitt]], his [[Director of the National Clandestine Service|Deputy Director for Operations]] at the CIA, announced his resignation the following day, leading to speculation that the exit of both senior intelligence officials was related to the controversy over alleged Iraqi WMDs and the decision to go to war. [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Stansfield Turner]], director of the CIA under President [[Jimmy Carter]], said, "I think the president feels he's in enough trouble that he's got to begin to cast some of the blame for the morass that we are in Iraq on to somebody else and this was one subtle way to do it." (''[[Boston Herald]]'', [[June 4]], [[2004]])  However, Bush voiced support for Tenet's efforts, stating, "George Tenet did a superb job for America. It was a high honor to work with him, and I'm sorry he left." (''[[Reuters]]'', [[June 5]], [[2004]])

===Awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom===

Tenet's seven-year term as Director of Central Intelligence was the second-longest in U.S. history. On [[December 14]], [[2004]], President Bush awarded Tenet the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. This was a decision that some senior [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] questioned, citing intelligence failures to find WMDs in Iraq. A spokesperson for Senator and 2004 [[United States presidential election, 2004|presidential candidate]] [[John Kerry]] said that "George Bush wasn't using the same standard when honoring Tenet and <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Coalition Provisional Authority]] head [[L. Paul Bremer|L. Paul] Bremer]] that was applied to previous honorees."  Democratic Senator [[Carl Levin]] of [[Michigan]], in response to the award said that he "would have reached a different conclusion" on Tenet. "I don't think [he] served the president or the nation well."<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A63623-2004Dec14.html</ref>

==Recent activities==
===QinetiQ===
In [[October]] [[2006]] Tenet joined [[QinetiQ]] as an independent non-executive director.<ref>http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/article1927199.ece</ref>

===Memoir===
{{Main|At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA}}
[[Image:GeorgeTenetBook.jpg|thumb|right|110px|[[At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA|At the Center of the Storm]]]]
In [[April]] [[2007]] Tenet released his [[memoir]] titled ''[[At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA]]''. He appeared on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' on [[April 29]] [[2007]], making several accusations against the Bush administration. The book was the top-selling book in sales in the first week after publication. It has received some discussion in the media from former government officials.

Critics pointed out one factual error in Tenet's book. A key conversation with then-[[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] advisor [[Richard Perle]] on [[September 12]], [[2001]] in which Tenet claims Perle told him in person that "Iraq had to pay for the attack" could not have occurred; Perle was stranded in [[Paris]] [[France|[France]]] and didn't return to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] until three days later. However, in an interview with [[CNN]]'s [[Wolf Blitzer]] during an episode of ''[[The Situation Room]]'' Perle admitted that the two men indeed crossed each other one morning, as claimed by Tenet, but only later in the same week and not on September 12. In addition, Perle insisted that in that encounter no words have been exchanged between him and Tenet. <ref>{{cite news | author = Associated Press | title = Tenet Memoir Draws Heat From Key Players | url = http://www.losangeleschronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=25702 | accessdate = 2007-04-30}}</ref>
