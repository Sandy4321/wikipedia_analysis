{{for|the music theorist|Patricia Carpenter (music theorist)}}

'''Patricia Carpenter''' is Lee and Marge Gregg [[Professor]] of [[Psychology]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]].  Her research focuses on the organization of the [[cognitive system]]s in immediate [[thought]], for example, the [[cognitive process|processes]] that underlie [[problem solving]] and [[sentence comprehension]]. Her specific interest is in how these processes are organized, what constrains them, and how their functional organization relates to their cortical representation. To address these questions, she uses [[functional imaging]] (fMRI) studies of people while they perform complex cognitive tasks and relates the imaging data to more traditional behavioral studies of [[cognition]] and [[computational theory of mind|computational models]]. In addition, her research extends to understanding how language comprehension and problem solving are approached by individuals with unusual characteristics, including those who have had a [[stroke]] or who have [[autism]].

In recent years, Carpenter has begun to explore the field of [[embodied cognition]] through her research.  Her primary starting point is a biologically-grounded account of cognition called the '[[fractal catalytic model]].' In this model, it is proposed that, to understand the mind/brain relation, one should first explore 'what is life' and what enables a living process to persist as an organized entity; this exploration deepens and changes our understanding of cognition and provides a new framework for the [[Mind-body dichotomy|mind-brain relation]].
