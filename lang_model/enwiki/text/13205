'''''Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!''''' is the debut studio album by American [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Megadeth]], released in June 1985 through [[Combat Records|Combat]] and [[Relativity Records]]. During the beginning of 1985, the band was given $8,000 by Combat to record and produce their debut album, but this proved to not be enough and so the band were given a further $4,000. Instead, a majority of the budget was spent on drugs, alcohol, and food so thus the band was forced to fire their original producer and produce it themselves. Despite the resulting poor production, the album was a well-received effort that was credited for blending elements of [[thrash metal|thrash]] and [[speed metal]]. It explores themes of death, violence and social commentary, and received positive reviews from most music critics.

The album featured a controversial cover of "[[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']]" and the track "[[The Mechanix|Mechanix]]", a song [[Dave Mustaine]] originally wrote for [[Metallica]]. A deluxe edition, completely [[remix]]ed and [[remaster]]ed with several bonus tracks, was released through [[Loud Records]] in 2002. It features vastly different artwork, with its cover based on the version originally designed by Mustaine in 1985. Several songs from the album have been performed by Megadeth during their various tours. As of 2005, Killing Is My Business had sold over 254,000 copies in the U.S since the beginning of the Soundscan era.<ref>http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=45667</ref>

==Overview==
Two months after Dave Mustaine was fired from Metallica due to [[Alcoholism|drinking]], drug use, violent behavior and personality conflicts with [[James Hetfield]] and [[Lars Ulrich]], Mustaine and bassist [[Dave Ellefson]] formed [[Megadeth]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].<ref>Mustaine, p. 234</ref> Mustaine later said, "After getting fired from Metallica, all I remember is that I wanted blood. Theirs. I wanted to be faster and heavier than them".<ref name="pop">{{cite web |work=[[PopMatters]] |author=Begrand, Adrien |date=2002-04-01 |url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/m/megadeath-killing.shtml |title=Killing is My Business... and Business is Good! (Loud) |accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref>

Fueled by the desire for revenge, Mustaine elevated the intensity of Megadeth's music, speeding up existing songs such as "Mechanix", which Metallica's new line-up adapted into the slower paced "[[Kill 'Em All#"The Four Horsemen"|The Four Horsemen]]."<ref>Mustaine, p. 236</ref> Mustaine included his original version of the song on the album to "straighten Metallica up", as Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and said he could not play guitar.<ref name="Metal Forces">{{cite web |title=Love it to Death <U+2013> Bernard Doe speaks to Dave Mustaine about life after Metallica |last=Doe |first=Bernard |publisher=[[Metal Forces]] |url=http://www.metalforcesmagazine.com/site/feature-megadeth-mf12/ |accessdate=June 16, 2012}}</ref> Also, the song "Last Rites/Loved to Deth" reinterprets the introduction of [[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], speeding up the [[tempo]].<ref>{{cite web |work=[[Last.fm]] |author=mveers |date=2005-08-29 |url=http://www.last.fm/user/mveers/journal/2005/08/29/1awh_megadeth's_%22last_rites%22_and_j.s._bach's_%22toccata_and_fugue_in_d_minor%22 |title=Megadeth's "Last rites" and J.S. Bach's "Toccata and Fugue in D minor" |accessdate=2010-11-13}}</ref>

After unsuccessfully searching for a vocalist for nearly six months, Mustaine decided to handle lead vocal duties himself, while also serving as the band's primary lyricist, main songwriter and co-lead and rhythm guitarist.<ref>{{cite web |work=Bravewords.com |author=Artsen, Mike |date=2010-06-08 |url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/142370 |title=MEGADETH - More Dave Mustaine Autobiography Release Details Revealed |accessdate=2010-11-11}}</ref> Early in 1984, Megadeth recorded a three song demo, and on the strength of their demo, Megadeth was asked to be signed with the New York based independent label Combat Records.<ref>{{cite web |work=Tartanddesire.com |date=2009-10-14 |url=http://www.tartareandesire.com/bands/Megadeth/1020/ |title=Megadeth Band Biography |accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref> Early in 1985, the band was given $8,000 by Combat to record and produce their debut album.<ref name="storm">{{cite web |work=Metalstorm.com |author=Totalis, Arian |date=2009-01-04 |url=http://www.metalstorm.net/pub/review.php?review_id=6256 |title=Megadeth - Killing Is My Business...

The album features the first of many covers performed by Megadeth: a speed metal version of [[Nancy Sinatra]]'s classic "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'", with lyrics altered by Mustaine.<ref name="boots">{{cite web |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=2009-06-05 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=121403 |title=MEGADETH's 'Killing Is My Business' Digipack LP Miniature CD Available |accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref> The song sparked controversy in later years when the song's original author, [[Lee Hazlewood]], deemed Mustaine's changes to be "vile and offensive" and demanded that the song be removed from the album. Under threat of legal action, the song was removed from all pressings released after 1995.<ref>{{cite web |work=Blogspot.com |author=Demonicmatta |date=2010-04-22 |url=http://demonicmatta-thesoutherncross.blogspot.com/2010/04/megadeth-killing-is-my-business-and.html |title=Megadeth - Killing Is My Business...

==Release and promotion==
The album's artwork, featuring a plastic skull with tinfoil, was not intended to be the original artwork.<ref>Mustaine, p. 239</ref> Both Mustaine and Ellefson had many phone conversations with Combat records to get the cover artwork properly reproduced from a sketch given to them by Mustaine of a picture of Megadeth mascot [[Vic Rattlehead]] on the cover.<ref name="killing2">{{cite web |work=Friedalive.com |author=Friedalive |date=2010-06-24 |url=http://www.friedalive.com/2010/09/24/megadeth-killing-is-my-business-and-business-is-good-original-uk-2x45rpm-dmm-mastering-music-for-nations-label/ |title=Megadeth <U+2013> Killing Is My Business<U+2026> And Business Is Good! |accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref> However the studio lost the artwork, and instead made their own improvised and low-budget replacement, with which Mustaine and the whole band were mortified.<ref name="killing2"/>

In the summer of 1985, the group toured the United States and Canada for the first time, supporting ''Killing Is My Business...'' with [[Exciter (band)|Exciter]].<ref>{{cite web |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=2010-10-12 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=123557 |title=Ex-MEGADETH Touring Guitarist MIKE ALBERT Releases 'Weapons' |accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref> During the tour, new guitarist [[Chris Poland]] abruptly left the band, and was replaced by touring guitarist Mike Albert.

The album was released in June 1985, and to date remains the only Megadeth album that did not chart on the [[Billboard 200]], primarily because it was released through an independent label with little promotion.<ref name="Billboard Albums">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4885|pure_url=yes}} |title=Megadeth > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums |work=[[Allmusic]] |publisher=[[Macrovision]] |accessdate=July 31, 2008}}</ref> Nevertheless, the album still went on to become one of Combat Records' highest selling releases.<ref name="combat">{{cite web |work=Avahome.ws |author=Necromandus |date= 2008-12-20 |url=http://avaxhome.ws/music/metal/thrash_metal/megadeth_-_peace_sells_whos.html |title=Megadeth - Peace Sells...

''Killing is My Business... and Business Is Good!'' received generally positive reviews from critics. Megadeth's official website refers to ''Killing Is My Business'' as "undoubtedly, their rawest-sounding, most intense, fastest, angriest, and overall thrashiest album they've ever released."<ref>{{cite web |work=Megadeth.com |url=http://www.megadeth.com/discography.php?era_id=1 |title=Killing Is My Business... And Business Is Good! |accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref> Steve Huey from [[Allmusic]] said that the album is "raw as Megadeth gets, and that can be both good and bad -- Megadeth's later precise, complex riffing and composition aren't completely developed, but the music is performed with a great deal of energy, while Mustaine's vocals (never his strong point) are amateurish at best."<ref name="AM"/>

Adrien Begrand of [[PopMatters]] dismissed the original recording, but praised the re-release, writing "the album blazes on at a furious pace, and being a 1985 metal album, the subject matter, though now a bit dated, is such a refreshing change from the [[suburban]] angst that dominates today's [[nu-metal]]. Instead, we're treated to fun scenarios like a song based on [[The Punisher]] [[comic book]] ("Killing Is My Business"), the [[occult]] ("The Skull Beneath the Skin"), and the deliriously [[bombastic]] Christ point-of-view on "Looking Down the Cross".<ref name="pop"/> [[Sputnikmusic]] staff member Mike Stagno agreed with the praise for the remaster, writing that "the remaster is greatly appreciated, for it removes the fuzzy, hard to hear sounds of the 1985 version, replacing them with a crisper, cleaner tone. But don't fret; the album still retains that raw, thrashy sound that one would expect from an 80's thrash band."<ref name="sputnik"/> The album is also rated "excellent" by the review score on the site.<ref name="sputnik"/>

==Legacy==
"Mechanix" became a live staple of the band during the 80's and 90's, and was the only song on the album to be featured on ''[[Greatest Hits: Back to the Start]]'', a 2005 [[compilation album|compilation]] record where fans voted on the track listing.<ref name="allmusic3">{{cite web |work=[[Allmusic]] |author=Jason, Birchmeier |date=2005-06-28 |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r785002|pure_url=yes}} |title=Greatest Hits: Back to the Start [Bonus DVD] |accessdate=2010-11-09}}</ref> Mustaine would sometimes perform the song in concert, differentiating between "their (Metallica's) way" (referring to "The Four Horsemen") and "our way".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0615962/bio |title=Dave Mustaine - Quotes |publisher=[[IMDb.com]] |accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref>

With the exception of "Mechanix", songs from ''Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!'' are rarely performed live. However, on October 21, 2010, the final date of the [[J<U+00E4>germeister Music Tour]] in the fall of 2010, [[Kerry King]] of thrash metal band [[Slayer]] joined Megadeth on stage at the Gibson Amphitheater in [[Hollywood, California]] to perform Megadeth's song "Rattlehead". This was the first time in 26 years that Kerry King has shared the stage with Megadeth since he played with the band during Megadeth's very first shows in 1984.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=148091 |title=Blabbermouth.Net - Slayer'S Kerry King To Perform With Megadeth Tonight! |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref> Furthermore, thrash metal band [[Austrian Death Machine]] covered the song "Killing Is My Business...and Business Is Good!" on the second disc of the album ''[[Double Brutal]]''.<ref>{{cite web |work=[[Allmusic]] |author=Freeman, Phil |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1639546|pure_url=yes}} |title=Double Brutal |accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref>
