'''John Sinclair, 1st Baron Pentland''', [[Order of the Star of India|GCSI]], [[Order of the Indian Empire|GCIE]] (July 7, 1860 <U+2013> January 11, 1925) was a [[Scottish Liberal Party]] politician, soldier, peer, administrator and Privy Councillor who served as the Secretary of Scotland from 1905 to 1912 and the [[Governor of Madras]] from 1912 to 1919.

Baron Pentland was born John Sinclair to Sir John Sinclair, 6th baronet of [[Dunbeath]]. He studied in the United Kingdom and in 1892, entered the United Kingdom House of Commons as an elected member of parliament for Dunbartonshire from the Liberal Party. He was elected for a second term from Forfar in 1897 and served in the British Parliament from 1892 to 1895 and 1897 to 1909. He also served as an [[Aide-de-Camp]] and secretary to Lord Aberdeen. Sinclair was appointed to the [[Privy Council]] in 1905. He served as the Secretary for Scotland from 1905 to 1912 and as the Governor of Madras from 1912 to 1919. Baron Pentland died in 1925.

Pentland was Secretary of State for Scotland during the Oscar Slater miscarriage of justice in 1909. Although he commuted Slater's death penalty to life imprisonment he did not investigate concerns, raised by many including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, that the Glasgow Police, James Neil Hart (the Procurator Fiscal) and the Lord Advocate Ure conspired to protect the then influential Charteris and Birrell families of Glasgow. Slater's appeal was upheld in 1928.

In February 1912, Pentland retired as the Secretary for Scotland and was succeeded by [[Thomas McKinnon Wood|T.

== As Governor of Madras ==

Pentland served as the [[Governors of Madras|Governor of Madras]] from 1912 to 1919. For the most part of his tenure as Governor of Madras, [[British India]] was embroiled in the [[First World War]].

=== Construction of the Pamban Bridge ===
{{See also|Pamban Bridge}}

In June 1911, [[Arthur Lawley]] had commissioned the construction of a railway bridge connecting [[Pamban Island]] with the Indian mainland. The existing railway line ended with the town of [[Ramanathapuram]] and it was felt that its extension to Pamban island would boost trade and tourism. It would also make it easier for pilgrims to travel to the sacred [[Ramanathaswamy Temple, Rameswaram|Hindu shrine]] of [[Rameswaram]]. The construction of the 2.06&nbsp;km long cantilever railway bridge was undertaken by the German engineer Scherzer and completed in 2 years at a cost of Rs. 2,000,000 by 600 workers with no loss of life.<ref name="pambanbridge">{{cite news|title=Efforts to get Pamban bridge in UNESCO list|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2205006.cms|work=[[Times of India]]|date=July 15, 2007}}</ref> The bridge was opened by Lord Pentland for traffic on February 24, 1914.<ref name="pambanbridge"/>

The Pamban bridge is India's largest sea bridge and an UNESCO World Heritage monument.<ref name="pambanbridge" />

=== Pentland and Geddes ===

In 1914, Pentland invited the Scottish botanist and architect [[Patrick Geddes]] to conduct an exhibition on town-planning in Madras city. He reached Madras on December 20, 1914 after journeying overland from Calcutta through Vizagapatam, Guntur and Bellary.<ref name="geddesp256">[[#Geddes|Geddes]], Pg 256</ref> Pentland had been interacting with Geddes and was fascinated with his models  since 1890.<ref name="ladypentlandp213">[[#Lady Pentland|Lady Pentland]], Pg 213</ref>

Geddes had prepared for a detailed exhibition at Madras with a series of illustrations and maps. However, the ship by which they were slated to arrive in Madras, the "Clan Grant", was sunk to the south of [[Cape Comorin]] by the German ship ''[[SMS Emden (1906)|Emden]]''.<ref name="geddesp253">[[#Geddes|Geddes]], Pg 253</ref> This calamity delayed Geddes' visit to Madras by a couple of months and he had to recreate his presentations and illustrations.

The Cities and Town Planning Exhibition opened in the senate of the [[Madras University]] on January 17, 1915 and was inaugurated by the Governor who also gave an introductory speech.<ref name="geddesp260">[[#Geddes|Geddes]], Pg 260</ref> Patrick Geddes, then, gave a detailed lecture on cost-effective town planning and sanitation with the aid of real-life examples and a presentation with detailed illustrations and maps.<ref name="geddesp260" /> Geddes spent the next few months in Madras touring the countryside and making reports and illustrations of the different towns in the Presidency. He persuaded Pentland to appoint a town planning advisor and suggested the name of H. V. Lancaster who was a Vice-President of the Royal Institute of British Architects.<ref name="townplanning_foundingfather">{{cite news|title=Founding father of town planning in Madras|url=http://newstodaynet.com/2006sud/06jan/0301ss1.htm|work=News Today|date=January 3, 2006|first=V.|last=Sundaram}}</ref> Accordingly, in October 1915, Lancaster joined the service of the Madras government. <ref name="townplanning_foundingfather" />

=== During the First World War ===

Pentland set up a hospital ship which plied regularly between [[Africa]] and India and then, between India and the [[Middle East]], caring for sailors injured at sea and treating them. This hospital ship was paid for and maintained by some of the prominent citizens of Madras.<ref name="newstoday">{{cite news|url=http://newstodaynet.com/printer.php?id=7165|title=News Today|date=May 5, 2008|work=News Today}}</ref>

In 1914, the Department of Industries, which had earlier been disbanded in face of protests from the Madras Chamber of Commerce, was re-established.<ref name="colonialeconomyp30">{{cite book|title=A Colonial Economy in the Great Depression, Madras (1929-1937)|first=K.

; Shelling of Madras by ''SMS Emden''

On September 22, 1914, the German cruiser ''[[SMS Emden (1906)|Emden]]'' which was patrolling the Bay of Bengal launched a surprise attack on Madras <ref name="emden_nytimes1">{{cite news|title=The Emden shells Madras|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9407E1DA1430E733A25756C2A96F9C946596D6CF|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 25, 1914 | format=PDF}}</ref> shelling the oil tanks of the Burmah Oil Company that we set up on the shore.<ref name="historyofwar">{{cite news|title=Madras raid, 22 September 1914|first=J.|last=Rickard|date=September 27, 2007|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/raid_madras.html}}</ref> Five tanks were hit out of which two caught fire.<ref name="historyofwar" /> Nearly, 425,000 gallons of oil were lost in the attack.<ref name="historyofwar" /> Three Indians were killed and the Indian liner ''Chupra'' was damaged in the attack.<ref name="emden_nytimes1"/> The battle lasted fifteen minutes and ''Emden'' sailed away towards Pondicherry when the coastal defenses of Madras started to retaliate.<ref name="emden_nytimes1"/>

Though the casualties due to the attack were minimal, there was a great deal of material damage caused by the shelling. The people of Madras were terrified by these attacks that ''SMS Emden'' has carved out a place for itself in local folklore.

; Home Rule Movement

In 1915, the Home Rule Movement was started in order to demand home rule for India. In Madras, it was led by the Irishwoman [[Annie Besant]] and [[Sir S. Subramania Iyer]]. As the movement gathered strength, Pentland responded with Annie Besant's arrest in June 1917 for hoisting the provisional flag of free India and a crackdown on the leaders of the movement.<ref name="bgtilak">{{cite book|title=Bal Gangadhar Tilak: Struggle for Swaraj|first=Sri Ram|last=Bakshi|pages=107|publisher=Anmol Publications PVT LTD|year=1990|id=ISBN 81-7041-262-5, ISBN 978-81-7041-262-5}}</ref> Other freedom-fighter as [[George Arundale]] and B.

=== Pentland and Rameswaram ===

Lord Pentland and Lady Pentland were deeply interested in Hindu religion and philosophy.<ref name="newstoday" /> He appeared captivated by the [[Ramanathaswamy Temple, Rameswaram|Hindu shrine]] at Rameswaram which he visited during the inauguration of Pamban Bridge and recommended to the Viceroy to establish a committee to conduct a detailed undersea exploration at the site.<ref name="newstoday" />

{{quotation|For me Rameshwaram, very much like India as a whole is the real world. We English men live in a mad house of abstractions. Vital life in Rameshwaram has not yet withdrawn into the capsule of the head. It is the whole body that lives. No wonder the English man feels dreamlike: the complete life of Rameshwaram is something of which he merely dreams.... I did not see an English man in India who really lived there. They are all living in England, that is, in a sort of bottle filled with English air.... History can be events or memory of events.... along the Bay of Bengal the Madras Presidency runs, with the well-governed city of Madras at its center and the sublime and glorious temples of Tanjore, Tiruchi, Madurai and Rameshwaram adorning its Southern boundaries. And then Adam<U+2019>s Bridge- a reef of sunken islands<U+2019> beckons us across the Palk Straits to Ceylon, where civilization flourished more than 2000 years ago....Linga stones may be seen in many places on the highways in my Presidency. Hindus break upon them the coconuts which they are about to offer in sacrifice. Usually the phallic ritual is simple and becoming; it consists in anointing the stone with consecrated water or oil, and decorating it with leaves. At the Rameshwaram temple, the Linga stone is daily washed with Ganga water, which is afterwards sold to the pious, as holy water or mesmerized water has been sold in Europe. All these are a little part of my beloved Presidency - indeed my favourite India. Right from the dawn of history, India is extraordinarily continuous in time. In space, on the other hand, it is extraordinarily discontinuous.... from early times in India, it is ethnology, philology, and archaeology that give and will give us some notions of the truth. From archaeology much can be expected. I would earnestly request you to direct the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to undertake an extensive and intensive survey of Rameshwaram and its beautiful environs, particularly with reference to the historic and primordial Adam<U+2019>s Bridge|John Sinclair|Letter to Viceroy of India, Lord Hardinge, December 1, 1914<ref name="newstoday" />}}

=== Pentland's policy ===

Pentland was one of the classical British Indian politicians who shared their views on appeasing Indians and that words were more important than actions. The half-measures at industrial development were primarily undertaken to sustain the wartime economy of the First World War.

In 1917, he is believed to have told [[Edwin Samuel Montagu|Lord Montagu]], the [[Secretary of State for India]],

{{quotation|We ought to play with them (Indians), humour them in politics and discuss with them industrial development, education and social reform; but there is no necessity for doing anything<ref name="colonialeconomyp29">{{cite book|title=A Colonial Economy in the Great Depression, Madras (1929-1937)|first=K.

Lord Pentland is also remembered for having assisted the Indian mathematician [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] make his journey to [[England]].<ref name="ramanujan">{{cite book|title=Ramanujan: Letters and Commentary|pages=100|first=Srinivasa|last=Ramanujan|authorlink=Srinivasa Ramanujan|coauthors=Bruce C. Berndt, Robert Alexander Rankin|publisher=AMS Bookstore|year=1995|id=ISBN 0-8218-0287-9, ISBN 978-0-8218-0287-8}}</ref>

On the general poverty of the masses, Pentland remarked that laborers of Madras city had the habit of frequenting cinema halls to watch movies and suggested that this could be one of the possible reasons for their poverty.<ref name="folklorep119">{{cite book|title=Folklore, Public Sphere, and Civil Society|pages=119|first=M.

== Death ==

John Sinclair died in 1925, and was succeeded to the [[barony]] by his son.<ref name="csac" /><ref name="peerage_bio"/>

== Honours ==

Pentland was made a [[Order of the Indian Empire|Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire]] in 1912 and a [[Order of the Star of India|Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India]] in 1918.<ref name="guide_cabinetministersp330" />
