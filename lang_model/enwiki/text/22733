On November 11, 1960, a failed [[Coup d'<U+00E9>tat|coup]] attempt against President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] of [[South Vietnam]] was led by Lieutenant Colonel [[Vuong Van Dong]] and Colonel [[Nguyen Chanh Thi]] of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN). The rebels launched the coup in response to Diem's autocratic rule and the negative political influence of his brother [[Ngo Dinh Nhu]] and his sister-in-law [[Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu]]. After initially being trapped inside the [[Reunification Palace|Independence Palace]], Diem stalled the coup by holding negotiations and promising reforms. However, his real aim was to buy time for loyalist forces to enter [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] and relieve him. The coup failed when the [[Fifth Division|Fifth]] and [[Seventh Division]]s of the ARVN entered Saigon and defeated the rebels. More than four hundred people<U+2014>many of whom were civilian spectators<U+2014>were killed in the ensuing battle. Dong and Thi fled to [[Cambodia]], while Diem berated the United States for a perceived lack of support during the crisis. Afterwards, Diem ordered a crackdown, imprisoning numerous anti-government critics and former cabinet ministers. A trial for those implicated in the plot was held in 1963. Seven officers and two civilians were sentenced to death ''[[in absentia]]'', while 14 officers and 34 civilians were jailed.

== Background ==

The revolt was led by 28-year-old Lieutenant Colonel [[Vuong Van Dong]],<ref name="j117"/> a northerner, who had fought with the [[French Union]] forces against the [[Vietminh]] during the [[First Indochina War]]. Later trained at [[Fort Leavenworth]] in the [[United States]], Dong was regarded by American military advisers as a brilliant tactician and the brightest military prospect of his generation.<ref name="j117"/> Back in Vietnam, Dong became discontented with Diem's arbitrary rule and constant meddling in the internal affairs of the army. Diem promoted officers on loyalty rather than skill, and played senior officers against one another in order to weaken the military leadership and prevent them from challenging his rule. Years after the coup, Dong asserted that his sole objective was to force Diem to improve the governance of the country.<ref name="k"/> Dong was clandestinely supported by his brother-in-law Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Trieu Hong and Hong's uncle Hoang Co Thuy.<ref name="h131"/> Thuy was a wealthy Saigon-based lawyer.<ref name=m109>[[#refMoyar|Moyar]], p. 109.</ref>

Many Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) officers were members of other anti-communist nationalist groups that were opposed to Diem, such as the [[Dai Viet Quoc Dan Dang]] (''Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam'') and the [[Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang]] (VNQDD, ''Vietnamese Nationalist Party''), which were both established before [[World War II]]. The VNQDD had run a military academy in [[Yunnan]] near the [[China|Chinese]] border with the assistance of their nationalist Chinese counterparts, the [[Kuomintang]]. Diem and his family had crushed all alternative anti-communist nationalists, and his politicisation of the army had alienated the servicemen. Officers were promoted on the basis of political allegiance rather than competence, meaning that many VNQDD and Dai Viet trained officers were denied such promotions.<ref name="hback">[[#refHammer|Hammer]], pp. 131&ndash;133.</ref>

Planning for the coup had gone on for over a year, with Dong recruiting disgruntled officers. This included his commander, Colonel [[Nguyen Chanh Thi]]. In 1955, Thi had fought for Diem against the [[Binh Xuyen]] [[organized crime|organised crime syndicate]] in the [[Battle for Saigon]] in 1955. This performance so impressed Diem that the president thereafter referred to Thi as "my son".<ref name = "j117"/><ref>[[#refHalberstam|Halberstam]], p. 23.</ref> The [[CIA]] described Thi as <U+201C>an opportunist and a man lacking strong convictions<U+201D>.<ref name=m109/> An American military advisor described Thi as <U+201C>tough, unscrupulous, and fearless, but dumb<U+201D>.<ref name=m109/> The coup was organised with the help of some VNQDD and Dai Viet members, civilians and officers alike.<ref name="h131"/> Dong enlisted the cooperation of an armoured regiment, marine unit and three paratrooper battalions. The operation was scheduled to launch on November 11 at 05:00.<ref name="k"/><ref name="h131"/> However, the airborne soldiers were not aware of what their officers had in store. They were told that they were heading into the countryside to attack the [[Vietcong]].<ref name=m108>[[#refMoyar|Moyar]], p. 108.</ref> Once they were on their way, the officers claimed that the [[Presidential Guard (South Vietnam)|Presidential Guard]], who were meant to guard the presidential palace, had mutinied against Diem.<ref name=m108/>

== Coup ==
According to [[Stanley Karnow]], the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author of ''Vietnam: A History'', the coup was ineffectively executed;<ref name="k"/> although the rebels captured the headquarters of the Joint General Staff at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base]],<ref name="h131"/> they failed to follow the textbook tactics of blocking the roads leading into [[Saigon]]. They also failed to disconnect phone lines into the palace, which allowed Diem to call for aid from loyal units.<ref name=k/>

The paratroopers headed down the main thoroughfare of Saigon towards Independence Palace.<ref name=m109/> At first, the forces encircled the compound without attacking, believing that Diem would comply with their demands. Dong attempted to call on US ambassador [[Elbridge Durbrow]] to put pressure on Diem. Durbrow, although a persistent critic of Diem, maintained his government's position of supporting Diem, stating "We support this government until it fails".<ref name="k">[[#refKarnow|Karnow]], pp. 252&ndash;253.</ref> Most of the rebel soldiers had been told that they were attacking in order to save Diem from a mutiny by the Presidential Guard. Only one or two officers in any given rebel unit knew the true situation.<ref name="h131"/>

A high wall, a fence and a few guard posts, surrounded the palace grounds. The mutinous paratroopers disembarked from their transport vehicles and moved into position for an attack on the main gate. Some ran forward and others raked automatic gunfire at the front of the palace, shattering most of the windows and puncturing the walls.<ref name=m109/> Diem was nearly killed in the opening salvoes. A rebel machine gun fired into Diem<U+2019>s bedroom window from the adjacent Palais de Justice and penetrated his bed, but the president had arisen just a few minutes earlier.<ref name=m109/>
 
The paratroopers' first assault on the palace met with surprising resistance. The Presidential Guardsmen who stood between the rebels and Diem were estimated at between 30 and 60,<ref name=j117/><ref name=m109/> but they managed to repel the initial thrust and kill seven rebels who attempted to scale the palace walls and run across the grass. The rebels cordoned off the palace and held fire.<ref name="j117"/><ref name=m109/> They trucked in reinforcements and the attack restarted at 7:30, but the Presidential Guard continued to resist. Half an hour later, the rebels brought in five armored vehicles and circumnavigated the palace. They fired at the perimeter posts, and mortared the palace grounds. However, the exchange had petered out by 10:30.<ref name=m109/> In the meantime, the rebels had captured the national police offices, Radio Saigon and the barracks of the Presidential Guard. They had also put most of the Saigon-based generals under house arrest, meaning that Diem<U+2019>s saviours would have to come from outside Saigon.<ref name=m110>[[#refMoyar|Moyar]], p. 110.</ref>  

Diem headed for the cellar, joining his younger brother and confidant [[Ngo Dinh Nhu]], and his wife [[Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu]].<ref name=m109/> Brigadier General [[Nguyen Khanh]], at the time the Chief of Staff of the ARVN, climbed over the palace wall to reach Diem during the siege.<ref name=h132/> Khanh lived in the city center, close to the palace, and awoken by the gunfire, he drove towards the action. The plotters had tried to put him under house arrest at the start of the coup, but were unaware that he moved house. Khanh proceeded to coordinate the loyalist defenders, along with Ky Quan Liem, the deputy director of the Civil Guard.<ref>[[#refMoyar|Moyar]], pp. 109&ndash;110.</ref> 

At daybreak, civilians began massing outside the palace gates, verbally encouraging the rebels and waving banners advocating regime change. Saigon Radio announced that a "Revolutionary Council" was in charge of South Vietnam<U+2019>s government. Diem appeared lost, while many Saigon-based ARVN troops rallied to the insurgents. According to Nguyen Thai Binh, an exiled political rival, "Diem was lost. Any other than he would have capitulated."<ref name="j117"/> However, the rebels hesitated as they decided their next move. Dong felt that the rebels should take the opportunity of storming the palace and capturing Diem. Thi on the other hand, was worried that Diem could be killed in an attack. Thi felt that despite Diem's shortcomings, the president was South Vietnam's best available leader, believing that enforced reform would yield the best outcome.<ref name = "j118"/> The rebels wanted Nhu and his wife out of the government, although they disagreed over whether to kill or deport the couple.<ref name="j117">[[#refJacobs|Jacobs]], p. 117.</ref>

[[Image:Lbj mnhu.jpg||thumb|right|The rebels demanded the removal of First Lady [[Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu]] (pictured left, with [[Lyndon Johnson]]).]]
Thi demanded that Diem appoint an officer as Prime Minister and that Diem remove [[Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu]] from the palace. Saigon Radio broadcast a speech authorised by Thi's Revolutionary Council, claiming that Diem was being removed because he was corrupt and suppressed liberty. Worried by the uprising, Diem sent his private secretary [[Vo Van Hai]] to negotiate with the coup leaders.<ref name="l">[[#refLangguth|Langguth]], pp. 108&ndash;109.</ref> In the afternoon, Khanh left the palace to meet with rebel officers to keep abreast of their demands, which they reiterated.<ref name=m111>[[#refMoyar|Moyar]], p. 111.</ref>

[[Phan Quang Dan]], became the rebels' spokesman. The most prominent political critic of Diem, Dan had been disqualified from the [[1959 South Vietnamese legislative election|1959 legislative election]] after winning his seat by a ratio of 6:1 despite Diem having organised votestacking against him. He cited political mismanagement of the war against the Vietcong and the government's refusal to broaden its political base as the reason for the revolt.<ref name="j118"/> Dan spoke on Radio Vietnam and staged a media conference during which a rebel paratrooper pulled a portrait of the president from the wall, ripped it and stamped on it.<ref name=m114>[[#refMoyar|Moyar]], p. 114.</ref>

Khanh returned to the palace and reported the result of his conversation to the Ngos. He recommended that Diem resign due to the demands of the rebel forces and protestors outside the palace.<ref name=m111/> Madame Nhu railed against Diem agreeing to a power-sharing arrangement, asserting that it was the destiny of Diem and his family to save the country.<ref name="l"/> Madame Nhu<U+2019>s aggressive stance and persistent calls for Khanh to attack, prompted the general to threaten to leave. This forced Diem to silence his sister-in-law, and Khanh remained with the president.<ref name=m111/>

During the standoff, Durbrow ambivalently noted "We consider it overriding importance to Vietnam and Free World that agreement be reached soonest in order avoid continued division, further bloodshed with resultant fatal weakening Vietnam<U+2019>s ability [to] resist communists."<ref name="h131">[[#refHammer|Hammer]], p. 131.</ref> American representatives privately recommended to both sides to reach a  peaceful agreement to share power.<ref name=m111/>

[[Image:Nguyen Van Thieu with map (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The Fifth Division of Colonel Nguyen Van Thieu (pictured) helped rescue Diem from the rebels.]]

In the meantime, the negotiations allowed time for loyalists to enter Saigon and rescue the president.<ref name=j118/> Khanh used the remaining communication lines to message senior officers outside Saigon.<ref name=m110/> The [[Fifth Division]] of Colonel [[Nguyen Van Thieu]], a future president, brought infantry forces from [[Bien Hoa]], a town north of Saigon. The [[Seventh Division]] of Colonel [[Tran Thien Khiem]] brought in tanks from the Second Armored Battalion from [[My Tho]], a town in the [[Mekong Delta]] south of Saigon.<ref name=m110/><ref name="j118"/> Khanh also convinced [[Le Nguyen Khang]], the acting head of the [[Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps]] to send the 1st and 2nd Marrine Battalions.<ref name=m110/> Assistant Secretary of Defense [[Nguyen Dinh Thuan]] phoned Durbrow and discussed the impending standoff between the incoming loyalists and the rebels. Durbrow said <U+201C>I hope that the Revolutionary Committee and President Diem can get together and agree to cooperate as a civil war could only benefit communists. If one side or the other has to make some concessions in order [to] reach an agreement, I believe that would be desirable to ensure unity against the communists.<U+201D><ref name=m110/> Durbrow was worried that if he sided with one faction over the other, and that group was defeated, the United States would be saddled with a hostile regime.<ref name=m110/>

Diem advised Khanh to continue to negotiate with the paratroopers and seek a rapprochement.<ref name=m111/> After consenting to formal negotiations, the parties agreed to a ceasefire.<ref name=m112>[[#refMoyar|Moyar]], p. 112.</ref> In the meantime, loyalist forces continued to head towards the capital, while the rebels publicly claimed on radio that Diem has surrendered in an apparent attempt to attract more troops to their cause.<ref name=m112/> Diem promised to end press censorship, liberalise the economy, and hold free and fair elections. Diem refused to sack Nhu, but he agreed to dissolve his cabinet and form a government that would accommodate the Revolutionary Council. In the early hours of November 12, Diem taped a speech detailing the concessions, which the rebels broadcast on Saigon Radio.<ref name="j118">[[#refJacobs|Jacobs]], p. 118.</ref><ref name=m112/>

As the speech was being aired, two infantry divisions and supporting loyal armour approached the palace grounds. Some of the Saigon-based units that had joined the rebellion sensed that Diem had regained the upper hand and switched sides for the second time in two days. The paratroopers became outnumbered and were forced to retreat to defensive positions around their barracks, which was an ad hoc camp that had been set up in a public park approximately {{convert|1|km|mi}} away.<ref name="j118"/><ref name=m113>[[#refMoyar|Moyar]], p. 113.</ref> After a brief but violent battle that killed around 400 people, the coup attempt was crushed.<ref name="l"/> This included a large number of civilians, who had been engaging in anti-Diem protests outside the palace grounds. Thi exhorted them to bring down the Ngos by charging the palace, and 13 were gunned down by the loyalist soldiers as they invaded the grounds. The others dispersed quickly.<ref name=m112/>

== Aftermath ==
[[Image:Major-general-lansdale.jpg|right|thumb|Colonel Lansdale (pictured here as a [[Major General]]), a CIA agent who assisted Diem in the past, called for the removal of the US ambassador to Saigon.]]
After the failed coup, Dong, Thi and several other prominent officers fled to Tan Son Nhut and climbed aboard a [[C-47]].<ref name=m113/> They fled to [[Cambodia]], where they were given asylum by Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]].<ref name="h132"/> Diem promptly reneged on his promises, and began rounding up scores of critics, including several former cabinet ministers and some of the [[Caravelle Group]] of 18 who had released a petition calling for reform.<ref name="k"/> One of Diem's first orders after re-establishing command was to order the arrest of Dan, who was imprisoned and tortured.<ref name="j119">[[#refJacobs|Jacobs]], p. 119.</ref>

In the wake of the failed coup, Diem blamed Durbrow for a perceived lack of US support, while his brother Nhu further accused the ambassador of colluding with the rebels. Durbrow denied this, saying that he had been "100% in support of Diem".<ref name="h133"/> In May 1961, Nhu said "[t]he least you can say . . . is that the State Department was neutral between a friendly government and rebels who tried to put that government down . . . and the official attitude of the Americans during that coup was not at all the attitude the President would have expected".<ref name="h133"/> Durbrow called for Diem to treat the remaining rebel leaders leniently, stressing the need for Diem to <U+201C>unify all elements of the country<U+201D>, but Diem was adamantly opposed to this, angrily rebuffing the ambassador.<ref name=m113/>

The American military establishment strongly backed Diem. Colonel [[Edward Lansdale]], a [[CIA]] agent who helped entrench Diem in power in 1955, ridiculed Durbrow's comments and called on the [[Eisenhower administration]] to recall the ambassador.<ref name="j119"/> Lansdale said that <U+201C>It is most doubtful that Ambassador Durbrow has any personal stature remaining. Diem must feel that Durbrow sided with the rebels emotionally. Perhaps he feels that Durbrow<U+2019>s remarks over the months helped incite the revolt.<U+201D><ref name=m115/> Lieutenant General [[Lionel McGarr]], the new commander of the [[Military Assistance Advisory Group]], agreed with Lansdale.<ref name=j119/> McGarr had been in contact with both the rebel and loyalist units during the standoff and credited the failure of the coup to the <U+201C>courageous action of Diem coupled with loyalty and versatility of commanders bringing troops into Saigon<U+201D>.<ref name=m115>[[#refMoyar|Moyar]], p. 115.</ref> McGarr asserted that <U+201C>Diem has emerged from this severe test in position of greater strength with visible proof of sincere support behind him both in armed forces and civilian population.<U+201D><ref name=m115/> General [[Lyman Lemnitzer]], the chairman of the [[US Joint Chiefs of Staff]] said that <U+201C>When you have rebellious forces against you, you have to act forcibly and not restrain your friends. The main point is that sometimes bloodshed can<U+2019>t be avoided and that those in power must act decisively.<U+201D><ref name=m115/> 

Diem later implicated two Americans, [[George Carver (CIA officer)|George Carver]] and [[Russ Miller (official)|Russ Miller]] for involvement in the plot. Both had spent the coup attempt with the rebel officers. Durbrow had sent them there to keep track of the situation, but Diem felt that they were there to encourage the uprising.<ref name="m114"/> It was later revealed that Carver had friendly relations with the coup leaders and then arranged for Thuy to be evacuated from South Vietnam when the loyalists overwhelmed the paratroopers.<ref name=m114/> The Ngo brothers indicated to the Americans that Carver should be deported, and soon after, Carver received a death warrant. The threat was supposedly signed by the coup leaders, who were ostensibly angry because Carver had abandoned them and withdrawn American support for them.<ref name=m114/> The Americans thought that Nhu was the real culprit, but told the Ngo family that they were removing Carver from the country for his own safety, thereby allowing all parties to avoid embarrassment.<ref name=m114/> 

The rift between American diplomatic and military representatives in South Vietnam began to grow. In the meantime, Durbrow continued his policy of pressuring Diem to liberalize his regime. Durbrow saw the coup as a sign that Diem was unpopular and with the South Vietnamese president making only token changes, the ambassador informed Washington that Diem might have to be removed.<ref name=m115/> This was mirrored in the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] and Diem. The paratroopers had been regarded as the most loyal of the ARVN's units, so Diem intensified his policy of promoting officers based on loyalty rather than competence.<ref name="j119"/> Khiem was made a general and appointed Army Chief of Staff.<ref name="h133">[[#refHammer|Hammer]], p. 133.</ref> The Ngo brothers were so paranoid that they felt that Khanh was suspect as he had broken through the rebel lines too easily.<ref>[[#refHalberstam|Halberstam]], p. 180.</ref> Khanh<U+2019>s action gained him a reputation of having helped the president, but he was later criticised for having a foot in both camps. Critics claimed that Khanh had been on good terms with the rebels and decided against rebelling when it was clear that Diem would win.<ref name="h132">[[#refHammer|Hammer]], p. 132.</ref> Khanh was later dispatched to the [[Tay Nguyen|central highlands]] as the commander of the [[II Corps (South Vietnam)|II Corps]].<ref>[[#refHammer|Hammer]], pp. 127&ndash;128.</ref> General [[Duong Van Minh]], who did not come to Diem<U+2019>s defense during the siege and instead stayed at home. Diem responded by appointing Minh to the post of Presidential Military Advisor, where he had no influence or troops to command in case the thought of coup ever crossed his mind.<ref name=m114/><ref>[[#refHammer|Hammer]], p. 126.</ref>

== Trial ==

The trial of those charged with involvement in the coup occurred more than two years later in mid-1963. Diem scheduled the hearing in the middle of the [[Buddhist crisis]], a move that was interpreted as an attempt to deter the populace from further dissent. Nineteen officers and 34 civilians were accused of complicity in the coup and called before the Special Military Court.<ref name="htrial">[[#refHammer|Hammer]], pp. 154&ndash;155.</ref>

Diem's officials gave the Americans an unsubtle warning not to interfere. The official prosecutor claimed to have documents proving that a foreign power was behind the failed coup but said that he could not publicly name the nation in question. It was later revealed in secret proceedings that he pinpointed two Americans: [[George Carver (CIA officer)|George Carver]], an employee of the United States Operations Mission (an economic mission) who was later revealed to be a [[CIA]] agent, and [[Howard C. Elting]], described as the deputy chief of the American mission in Saigon.<ref name="htrial"/>

One of the prominent civilians summoned to appear before the military tribunal was a well-known novelist who wrote under the pen name of Nhat Linh. He was the VNQDD leader [[Nguyen Tuong Tam]], who had been [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s foreign affairs minister in 1946. Tam had abandoned his post rather than lead the delegation to the [[Fontainebleau Conference]] and make concessions to the [[French Union]]. In the 30&nbsp;months since the failed putsch, the police had not taken the conspiracy claims seriously enough to arrest Tam, but when Tam learned of the trial, he committed suicide by ingesting [[cyanide]]. He left a death note stating "I also will kill myself as a warning to those people who are trampling on all freedom", referring to [[Thich Quang Duc]], the [[bhikkhu|monk]] who self-immolated in protest against Diem's persecution of Buddhism.<ref name="htrial"/> Tam's suicide was greeted with a mixed reception. Although some felt that it upheld the Vietnamese tradition of choosing death over humiliation, some VNQDD members considered Tam's actions to be romantic and sentimental.<ref name="htrial"/>

The brief trial opened on July 8, 1963. The seven officers and two civilians who had fled the country after the failed coup were found guilty and sentenced to death in absentia. Five officers were acquitted, while the remainder were imprisoned for terms ranging from five to ten years. Another VNQDD leader [[Vu Hong Khanh]] was given six years in prison. Former Diem cabinet minister [[Phan Khac Suu]]  was sentenced to eight years, mainly for being a signatory of the [[Caravelle Group]] which called on Diem to reform. Dan, the spokesman was sentenced to seven years. Fourteen of the civilians were acquitted, including Tam.<ref name="htrial"/> 

However, the prisoners<U+2019> time in prison was brief, as Diem was [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|deposed]] and [[arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem|killed in a coup]] in November 1963.<ref>[[#refBlair|Blair]], p. 70.</ref> On November 8, political opponents who had been imprisoned on the island of [[Poulo Condore]] were released by the military junta. Dan was garlanded and taken to military headquarters, and on November 10, Suu was released and welcomed by a large crowd at the town hall.<ref>[[#refBlair|Blair]], p. 81.</ref> Thi returned to South Vietnam and resumed his service in the ARVN.<ref>[[#refKarnow|Karnow]], pp. 460&ndash;464.</ref>
