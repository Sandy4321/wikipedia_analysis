In [[statistics]], a '''histogram''' is a [[graphical display]] of tabulated [[frequency (statistics)|frequencies]], shown as [[Bar chart|bars]]. It shows what proportion of cases fall into each of several [[Categorization|categories]]: it is a form of [[data binning]].  The categories are usually specified as non-overlapping [[interval]]s of some variable. The categories (bars) must be adjacent. The intervals (or bands, or bins) are generally of the same size,<ref>Howitt, D. and Cramer, D. (2008) "Statistics in Psychology". Prentice Hall</ref> but not necessarily so.

Histograms are used to plot density of data, and often for [[density estimation]]: estimating the [[probability density function]] of the underlying variable. The total area of a histogram used for probability density is always normalized to 1. If the length of the intervals on the ''x''-axis are all 1, then a histogram is identical to a [[relative frequency]] plot.

An alternative to the histogram is [[kernel density estimation]], which uses a [[kernel (statistics)|kernel]] to smooth samples. This will construct a [[smooth function|smooth]] probability density function, which will in general more accurately reflect the underlying variable.

The histogram is one of the seven basic tools of [[quality control]], which also include the [[Pareto chart]], [[check sheet]], [[control chart]], [[cause-and-effect diagram]], [[flowchart]], and [[scatter diagram]].

== Etymology ==

[[Image:Black cherry tree histogram.svg|thumb|left|An example histogram of the heights of 31 [[Prunus serotina|Black Cherry]] trees.]]
The word ''histogram'' derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''histos'' 'anything set upright' (as the masts of a ship, the bar of a loom, or the vertical bars of a histogram);  and ''gramma'' 'drawing, record, writing'. The term was introduced by [[Karl Pearson]] in 1895.<ref>{{cite journal

== Examples ==
As an example we consider data collected by the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] on time to travel to work (2000 census, [http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-33.pdf], Table 2). The census found that there were '''124 million people''' who work outside of their homes. An interesting feature of this graph is that the number recorded for "at least 30 but less than 35 minutes" is higher than for the bands on either side. This is likely to have arisen from people rounding their reported journey time. This rounding is a common phenomenon when collecting data from people.

This histogram shows the number of cases per [[unit interval]] so that the height of each bar is equal to the proportion of total people in the survey who fall into that category. The area under the curve represents the total number of cases (124 million). This type of histogram shows absolute numbers.

This histogram differs from the first only in the [[vertical direction|vertical]] scale. The height of each bar is the decimal percentage of the total that each category represents, and the total area of all the bars is equal to 1, the decimal equivalent of 100%. The curve displayed is a simple [[density estimation|density estimate]]. This version shows proportions, and is also known as a unit area histogram.

In other words a histogram represents a frequency distribution by means of rectangles whose widths represent class intervals and whose areas are proportional to the corresponding frequencies. The intervals are placed together in order to show that the data represented by the histogram while being exclusive is also continuous. (E.g., in a histogram it is possible to have two connnecting intervals of 10.5-20.5 and 20.5-33.5, but not two connecting intervals of 10.5-20.5 and 22.5-32.5.  Empty intervals are represented as empty and not skipped.)<ref>Dean, S., & Illowsky, B. (2009, February 19). Descriptive Statistics: Histogram.

==Activities and demonstrations==
The [[SOCR]] resource pages contain a number of hands-on interactive activities demonstrating the concept of a histogram, histogram [http://wiki.stat.ucla.edu/socr/index.php/SOCR_EduMaterials_ModelerActivities_MixtureModel_1 construction] and [http://wiki.stat.ucla.edu/socr/index.php/SOCR_EduMaterials_Activities_PowerTransformFamily_Graphs manipulation] using Java applets and [http://www.socr.ucla.edu/htmls/SOCR_Charts.html charts].

== Mathematical definition ==
[[Image:Cumulative vs normal histogram.svg|thumb|350px|An ordinary and a cumulative histogram of the same data. The data shown is a random sample of 10,000 points from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.]]
In a more general mathematical sense, a histogram is a mapping ''m''<sub>''i''</sub> that counts the number of observations that fall into various disjoint categories (known as ''bins''), whereas the graph of a histogram is merely one way to represent a histogram. Thus, if we let ''n'' be the total number of observations and ''k'' be the total number of bins, the histogram ''m''<sub>''i''</sub> meets the following conditions:

: <math>n = \sum_{i=1}^k{m_i}.</math>

=== Cumulative histogram ===
A cumulative histogram is a mapping that counts the cumulative number of observations in all of the bins up to the specified bin. That is, the cumulative histogram ''M''<sub>''i''</sub> of a histogram ''m''<sub>''i''</sub> is defined as:

: <math>M_i = \sum_{j=1}^i{m_j}.</math>

=== Number of bins and width ===
There is no "best" number of bins, and different bin sizes can reveal different features of the data.  Some theoreticians have attempted to determine an optimal number of bins, but these methods generally make strong assumptions about the shape of the distribution.  You should always experiment with bin widths before choosing one (or more) that illustrate the salient features in your data.

The number of bins ''k'' can be calculated directly, or from a suggested bin width&nbsp;''h'':

:<math>k = \left \lceil \frac{\max x - \min x}{h} \right \rceil.</math>

The braces indicate the [[Floor function#The ceiling function|ceiling function]].

;Sturges' formula<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sturges |first=H. A. |year=1926 |title=The choice of a class interval |journal=J. American Statistical Association | pages=65<U+2013>66}}</ref>:

:<math>k = \lceil \log_2 n + 1 \rceil, \, </math>

which implicitly bases the bin sizes on the range of the data, and can perform poorly if&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;<&nbsp;30.

;Scott's choice<ref>{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=David W. |year=1979 |title=On optimal and data-based histograms |journal=Biometrika |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=605<U+2013>610 |doi=10.1093/biomet/66.3.605 }}</ref>:

:<math>h = \frac{3.5 \sigma}{n^{1/3}},</math>

where <math>\sigma</math> is the sample [[standard deviation]]. 

;Freedman<U+2013>Diaconis' choice<ref>{{cite journal |last=Freedman |first=David |coauthors=Diaconis, P. |year=1981 |title=On the histogram as a density estimator: ''L''<sub>2</sub> theory |journal=Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und verwandte Gebiete |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=453<U+2013>476 |doi=10.1007/BF01025868 }}</ref>:

:<math>h = 2 \frac{\operatorname{IQR}(x)}{n^{1/3}},</math>

which is based on the [[interquartile range]]. A good discussion of this and other rules for choice of bin widths is in <ref>  W. N. Venables and B. D. Ripley: "Modern Applied Statistics with S", Springer, in (4thedition) section  5.6: "Density Estimation" </ref>
