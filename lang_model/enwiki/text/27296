The '''American butterfish''', ''Peprilus triacanthus'', is a [[butterfish]] of the family [[Stromateidae]]. It is also known as a [[dollarfish]], [[Shiner (fish)|shiner]], [[Skipjack tuna|skipjack]], [[sheepshead]], or [[harvestfish]].  It is closely related to a number of fish, including Black Cod, Sablefish and Chilean Sea Bass.

==Appearance==
Fish of this species are usually deep-bodied, flattened sideways and somewhat circular or rounded, with blunt noses and small mouths with weak teeth. Some other characteristics of this fish are the absence of [[ventral]] fins, one long continuous [[dorsal fin]], long [[pectoral fin]]s, and tiny [[cycloid]] scales. The tail fin is nearly as long as the dorsal fin and deeply forked. The American Butterfish is similar in appearance to its close relative, the [[harvestfish]] (''Peprilus alepidotus''), but can be distinguished by its much lower dorsal and tail fin.

This fish is a lead blue color above with pale sides and a silvery belly. It often has dark, irregular spots.

It is generally six to nine [[inch]]es long, though some individuals have been as long as 12 inches. They can weigh anywhere from 1&frac34; [[ounce]]s (50 g) to 1<U+00BC> [[pound (mass)|pounds]] (570 g) if particularly fat.

==Range==
From [http://www.gma.org/fogm/Poronotus_triacanthus.htm gma.org]:

''Atlantic coast of North America from the offing of South Carolina and from coastal North Carolina waters to the outer coast of Nova Scotia and Cape Breton; northward as a stray to the Gulf of St. Lawrence and to the south and east coasts of Newfoundland; southward to Florida in deep water.'' 

==Habits==
Relatively little is known about the American butterfish considering that it is an important food source and a common species. It travels in small bands or loosely organized [[school]]s, preferring sandy-bottomed areas to muddy ones, and often coming close to shore. During summer months, it does not swim deeper than ten to fifteen [[fathom]]s (20 to 30 m), but in the winter and early spring it may be found 100 to 115 fathoms (200 to 230 m) below the surface.

It feeds on small [[fish]], [[crustacean]]s, and [[annelid]]s.

==Breeding==
The American butterfish spawns in the [[Gulf of Maine]] during the summer months, peaking in July. It appears to spawn a few miles out to sea and return to the coast when finished. Incubation lasts less than 48 hours in water at 65 degrees [[Fahrenheit]] (18 <U+00B0>C). Fry are two [[millimeter]]s long at birth and by autumn, have grown to a length of three to four inches. The American butterfish appears to reach maturity at about two years of age.
