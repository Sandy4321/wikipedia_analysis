It was the first wrestling game published on this platform.<ref name="Suplexes">{{cite web | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/074/074368p1.html | title=Square Suplexes PlayStation 2 | accessdate=2007-07-19 | author=Zdyrko, Dave | date=January 19, 2000 | work=[[IGN]] | publisher=[[News Corporation]]}}</ref>

''All Star Pro-Wrestling'' was released in a period in which Square sought to diversify its catalog by producing various non-[[role-playing game]]s for the PlayStation 2. The game was notable for its control relying exclusively on the [[Dual Shock#Dual Shock 2|Dual Shock 2]]'s analog sticks, although a second mode using the normal buttons was also available.

While the quality of the game's graphics was lauded and sales were good during its month of release, the control was received negatively by critics, who felt it was awkward and unintuitive. Nevertheless, the game spawned two sequels in the following years.

==Gameplay==

''All Star Pro-Wrestling'' is based on [[Professional wrestling in Japan|Japanese wrestling]] rather than American. The game can be played in several modes selected in the "Match Make" menu; these include exhibition matches, championships, tournaments, or leagues separated by weight.<ref name="IGN review">{{cite web | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/080/080753p1.html | title=Import Review: All Star Pro Wrestling | accessdate=2007-07-19 | author=Williamson, Colin | coauthors=Horst, Timothy | date=June 12, 2000 | work=[[IGN]] | publisher=[[News Corporation]]}}</ref> Depending on the mode chosen, different [[boxing ring|wrestling rings]] can be chosen to battle, as well as the referee and the time limit.<ref name="GameSpot review">{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/adventure/allstarprowrestling/review.html | title=All Star Pro-Wrestling for PlayStation 2 Review | accessdate=2007-07-20 | author=Gerstmann, Jeff | date=June 21, 2000 | work=[[GameSpot]] | publisher=[[CNET Networks]]}}</ref> 26 real-life wrestlers are initially available, notably [[Keiji Mutoh|The Great Muta]], [[Don Frye]], [[Antonio Inoki]], and [[Masahiro Chono]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ps2.ign.com/objects/013/013971.html | title=All Star Pro-Wrestling | accessdate=2007-07-20 | work=[[IGN]] | publisher=[[News Corporation]]}}</ref>

Each battle begins with the wrestlers' entrance sequence. Two types of controls can be chosen to fight. The default one uses the [[Dual Shock#Dual Shock 2|Dual Shock 2]]'s analog sticks exclusively; the left one being pressed for movements and the right one for attacks. [[Pin (wrestling)|Pins]] are executed by tilting both sticks up; and pressing both sticks grabs the opponent, who can then be attacked or thrown depending on the way the right stick is tilted. The second type of controls, called "Type B", is closer to other fighting games and assigns pinning to the triangle button, grabbing to the square button, and punches and moves to the cross button. With Type B, the power of each move is determined by the level of pressure applied on the buttons. In both modes, the precise techniques available depend on the position and distance of the opponent, as well as a personal "tension meter" which builds up during battle. At any time, the [[D-pad]] can be used to change the angle of the camera.<ref name="IGN review" />

Wrestlers return to full health after each match, and the game keeps track of the time of victories and records with the PlayStation 2 internal clock. A [[memory card]] can be used to save progress, battle snapshots, and match videos; the latter of which can either be ten-second long [[instant replay]]s or up to three entire "Best Bout" matches. Hidden features include collectible autograph pictures of the defeated wrestlers; and a few unlockable characters, among whom are two female models in bikinis.<ref name="IGN review" />

==Development==
''All Star Pro-Wrestling'' was announced in January [[1999 in video gaming|1999]] as part of Square's desire to expand into more diverse game genres on the PlayStation 2 than their usual [[role-playing games]].<ref name="Suplexes" /> While [[Dream Factory]] developed most of Square's previous fighting games (namely ''[[Tobal No. 1]]'', ''[[Tobal 2]]'', and ''[[Ehrgeiz]]''), Square decided to develop a wrestling game internally as Dream Factory was already working on ''[[The Bouncer]]'', another Square title.<ref name="IGN review" /> The game was produced by [[Yusuke Hirata]] of ''[[Parasite Eve 2]]'' fame, head of Square's [[Osaka]]-based fifth production team.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/news/2005/1568.html | title=Square Enix Producer Joins Aquaplus | accessdate=2007-07-20 | author=RPGFan Staff | date=June 6, 2005 | work=[[RPGFan]] | publisher=Cerberus Media Group}}</ref> The score, which was never released in album form, consists mostly of [[rock music]] and was composed by [[Tsuyoshi Sekito]], [[Kenichiro Fukui]], and [[Kumi Tanioka]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/composers/fukui.html | title=Kenichiro Fukui :: Composer Information | accessdate=2007-07-25 | author=Z-Freak | co-author=Chris | work=[http://www.squareenixmusic.com/ Square Enix Music Online]}}</ref>

Square's aim with the title was to create some of the most realistic wrestlers seen in video games, with accurate details such as a faithful replication of body-muscle physics and facial expressions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2446210.html | title=First Details On New Square PS2 Titles | accessdate=2007-07-25 | author=Sato, Yukiyoshi Ike | date=January 19, 2000 | work=[[GameSpot]] | publisher=[[CNET Networks]]}}</ref> Screenshots of the game were shown during the Square Millenium Event in Japan in [[2000 in video gaming|2000]]; and a battle was played in demonstration by Yusuke Hirata and a young [[Japanese idol]] later in the same year at the [[Tokyo Game Show]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/133/133971p1.html | title=All Star Pro-Wrestling Preview | accessdate=2007-07-20 | author=IGN Staff | date=June 12, 2000 | work=[[IGN]] | publisher=[[News Corporation]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/077/077405p1.html | title=TGS 2000: The Square Booth | accessdate=2007-07-20 | author=Horst, Timothy | date=April 3, 2000 | work=[[IGN]] | publisher=[[News Corporation]]}}</ref>

==Reception==
[[Image:ASPW entrance.jpg|220px|right|thumb|Lightning effects during a ring entrance.]]
''All Star Pro-Wrestling'' topped the Japanese sale charts in its week of release with 107,331 copies sold, and continued to top the charts for the rest of the month of June.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/080/080970p1.html | title=Japanese Sales Charts | accessdate=2007-07-20 | author=IGN Staff | date=June 16, 2000 | work=[[IGN]] | publisher=[[News Corporation]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.squarehaven.com/news/?id=0035 | title=All Star Pro Wrestling Tops June Sales Charts | accessdate=2007-07-20 | author=Berti, Matt | date=July 12, 2000 | work=[[Square Haven]]}}</ref> It scored 31 out of 40 in the Japanese gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'', with the four reviewers highly praising the graphics but feeling that the controls, while not bad, could have been better implemented.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/080/080295p1.html | title=Now Playing in Japan | accessdate=2007-07-20 | author=IGN Staff | date=June 1, 2000 | work=[[IGN]] | publisher=[[News Corporation]]}}</ref>

The American gaming website [[GameSpot]] rated the game 4 out of 10, and criticized the battle system more severily along with [[IGN]], which stated that the default analog controls are "mind-boggling"; with [[pin (wrestling)|pins]] being very difficult to execute whereas some other maneuvers can be chained with single button presses. The second type of controls was judged easier to play with by IGN, although one reviewer felt that it wears out the thumb quickly. On the contrary, GameSpot felt that the second type is even more difficult to use than the default one. The amount of moves available has been described as low even compared to lackluster titles such as ''[[WWF Attitude]]''. Regarding the game's fluidity, GameSpot and one IGN critic compared it to the speed of an "underwater soccer match", with smooth moves coexisting with simple, three-second long movements. The second IGN critic noted that the game is more of a wrestling simulation than an arcade title focused on entertainment.<ref name="IGN review" /><ref name="GameSpot review" />

Still, both GameSpot and IGN lauded the realism of the wrestlers' appearances, their faithfulness to those of their real-life counterparts, and the efficient use of the PlayStation 2 [[Emotion Engine]]. The spectacular ring entrance scenes and the amount of blood visible during battles was also appreciated. One IGN critic noted that the referee is always present on-screen, unlike many other wrestling games. However, the other one stated that the outdoor arenas "look like they were ripped out of a [Sega] [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] game". He also criticized the presence of only two facial expressions for each wrestler; and both IGN reviewers criticized the inconsistent [[collision detection]] and the lack of diversity in the crowd, who sometimes "look like they were made out of [[Lego]]s". GameSpot added that the walking looks particularly unrealistic, in contrast with the other animations.<ref name="IGN review" /><ref name="GameSpot review" />

While both IGN reviewers noted the sparcity of the audio commentary and crowd shouting, one critic felt the sound was adequate albeit less impressive than the graphics. GameSpot called the sound decent and well executed. Finally, the omission of features such as weapons and modes such as "create-a-wrestler", [[steel cage match]], [[battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]], and multiplayer [[tag team]], was felt as a very noticeable weak point compared to American wrestling games present on the market.<ref name="IGN review" /><ref name="GameSpot review" />

==Legacy==
A sequel titled ''[[All Star Pro-Wrestling II]]'' was released in [[2001 in video gaming|2001]] for the PlayStation 2. It addressed the controls issue by replacing it with a new, more standard battle system, and featured three real-life Japanese wrestling federations: [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]], [[Pro Wrestling NOAH]], and [[Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX|Pro Wrestling ZERO-ONE]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/adventure/allstarprowrestling2/news.html?sid=2802566 | title=Square plans All-Star Pro Wrestling sequel this winter | accessdate=2007-07-23 | author=Sato, Yukiyoshi Ike | date=August 8, 2001 | work=[[GameSpot]] | publisher=[[CNET Networks]]}}</ref>  A third installment, ''[[All Star Pro-Wrestling III]]'' was released in [[2003 in video gaming|2003]] for the same platform.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.square-haven.com/news/?gid=aspw3 | title=All Star Pro-Wrestling III News | accessdate=2007-07-23 | author=Rahul | work=[[Square Haven]]}}</ref>
