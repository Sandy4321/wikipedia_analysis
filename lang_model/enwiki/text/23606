The '''10.5 cm leFH 18''' ([[German language|German]]: ''leichte FeldHaubitze'' "light field howitzer") was a German light [[howitzer]] used in the [[Second World War]].

==History==
The 10.5 cm leFH 18 was the standard [[Division (military)|divisional]] field howitzer used during the Second World War. It was designed and developed by [[Rheinmetall]] in 1929-30 and entered service with the [[Wehrmacht]] in 1935.  The leFH18 remained in service with the German Army until 1945.  Generally it did not equip independent artillery battalions until after the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1943. Before 1938 the leFH 18 was exported to [[Hungary during the Second World War|Hungary]] and [[Spain under Franco|Spain]]. 53 units were also exported to Finland, where they were known as '''105 H 33'''.

==Description==
It has a heavy, simple breech mechanism with a hydro-pneumatic recoil system.  The 10.5 cm leFH 18 was mounted on a towed chassis, with large metal or wood wheels rimmed with rubber.  Initially, it was not fitted with a [[muzzle brake]].  In 1941 a muzzle brake was fitted to allow longer range charges to be fired. This increased the range by about 1,800 yards and was known as the [[leFH 18M]]. In March 1942 a requirement was issued for a lighter howitzer.  This led to a second modification, known as the [[leFH 18/40]]. This modification consisted of mounting the barrel of an leFH 18M on the carriage for a [[7.5 cm PaK 40]] antitank gun. The new carriage increased the rate of fire as well as making the howitzer lighter.  Additionally, a more efficient muzzle brake was added, decreasing the recoil.  Ballistically, the 10.5 cm leFH 18M and the leFH 18/40 are identical.
