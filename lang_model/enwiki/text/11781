'''Hilda Campbell Vaughan''' (married name Morgan; 12 June 1892 <U+2013> 4 November 1985) was a Welsh novelist and short story writer. She was the author of ten varied novels, set mostly in her native [[Radnorshire]] and concerning rural communities and heroines, beginning with ''[[The Battle to the Weak]]'' in 1925. Her last novel was ''[[The Candle and the Light]]'', published in 1954. She was married to the writer [[Charles Langbridge Morgan]], who was an influence on her writings. Although favourably received by her contemporaries, Vaughan received minimal critical attention in subsequent years. A rediscovery of her work began in the 1980s and 90s particularly, as part of a renewed analysis of [[Welsh literature in English]].

==Life==
===Early years===
Vaughan was born in [[Builth Wells]], [[Powys]], then the [[Historic counties of Wales|county]] of [[Breconshire]], into a prosperous family, the youngest daughter of Hugh Vaughan Vaughan and Eva (''n<U+00E9>e'' Campbell). Her father was a successful country solicitor and held various public offices in the neighbouring county of [[Radnorshire]].<ref name=stephens>{{cite web|last=Stephens|first=Meic|title=Vaughan, Hilda Campbell (1892<U+2013>1985)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101062359/Hilda-Vaughan Vaughan, Hilda Campbell (1892<U+2013>1985)|work=[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=12 March 2014|authorlink=Meic Stephens|editor=[[Lawrence Goldman]]}} {{subscription required}}</ref> She was a descendant of 17th century poet [[Henry Vaughan]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=byQgAQAAMAAJ |page=680 |volume=141 |year=1960 |journal=Country Life |title=Writers as they see themselves}}</ref>

Vaughan was educated privately, and remained at home until the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914, after which she served in a [[Red Cross]] hospital and for the [[Women's Land Army]] in Breconshire and Radnorshire. Her work brought her into contact with women living on the local farms, and would become an influence on her writing.<ref name="Thomas 2008, p. 7.">Thomas 2008, p. 7.</ref> At the end of the war she left home for London, and whilst attending a writing course at [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]] met the novelist [[Charles Langbridge Morgan]]. They married on 6 June 1923 and afterwards took a flat together in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], where they lived for nine years.<ref name=stephens /> In December of the following year, Vaughan gave birth to the couple's first child, [[Shirley Paget, Marchioness of Anglesey|Elizabeth Shirley]].

===First major writings===
On her husband's advice, Vaughan decided not to publish ''[[The Invader (Hilda Vaughan novel)|The Invader]]'' as her [[Debut novel|first novel]]. Instead she opted to publish ''[[The Battle to the Weak]]'' (1925), whose manuscript Morgan had extensively edited; being both writers, the couple offered guidance and advice on each other's work.<ref name="Thomas 2008, p. 10.">Thomas 2008, p. 10.</ref> According to Christopher Newman, though her literary technique would develop throughout her career, this novel contains "virtually all the themes developed in her later works", especially those of duty and self-sacrifice.<ref name="Newman p. 24.">Newman p. 24.</ref> The novel was very favourably received, with reviews noting the accomplished character of the work, in spite of it being her first.<ref name="Thomas 2008, p. 12.">Thomas 2008, p. 12.</ref>

In 1926, Vaughan gave birth to the couple's second child, Roger. The success of her first novel was repeated in this same year with the publication of the novel ''[[Here Are Lovers]]''; when ''The Invader'' was finally published in 1928, it was also favourably received, considered by ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' to be 'one of the best novels of the year'.<ref name="Thomas 2008, p. 12." /> Her next two novels, ''[[Her Father's House (Hilda Vaughan novel)|Her Father's House]]'' (1930) and ''[[The Soldier and the Gentlewoman]]'' (1932) were also critically acclaimed.<ref name="Thomas 2008, p. 12." /> The latter, probably her most successful novel, was dramatised and shown at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]], London.<ref name=stephens />

===Later writings===
Her subsequent novels, ''The Curtain Rises'' (1935), ''Harvest Home'' (1936), ''The Fair Woman'' (1942), ''Pardon and Peace'' (1945)  and ''[[The Candle and the Light]]'' (1954) were also favourably received, although with less fervour than her earlier novels.<ref name="Thomas 2008, p. 12." /> With the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Charles sent Vaughan along with their children to the United States. They stayed there from 1939 to 1943, and ''The Fair Woman'' was published whilst there,<ref name=stephens /> though it was later published in England under the title ''[[Iron and Gold]]'' (1948). An exception to this more muted success was the [[short story]] or [[novella]] ''[[A Thing of Nought]]'' (1934; revised edition 1948), which returns to some of the same themes as ''The Battle to the Weak'';<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Hilda|title=The Battle to the Weak|publisher=Parthian|location=Cardiff|page=xiv|editor=Fflur Dafydd|chapter=Foreword}}</ref> as well as being critically acclaimed, it was also an unexpected commercial success to the extent that it was [[out of print]] within four days of publication.<ref name="Thomas 2008, p. 13.">Thomas 2008, p. 13.</ref> During this time she also wrote two plays with Laurier Lister: ''She Too was Young'' (1938), which was performed at [[Wyndham's Theatre]], London; and ''Forsaking All Other'', which was never performed.<ref name=stephens />

===Final years and death===
The 1950s and 60s were a time of disappointment for Vaughan who, though she had not written any new material, sought in vain to have her previous work re-issued by publishers.<ref name="Thomas 2008, p. 18.">Thomas 2008, p. 18.</ref> In 1957 she visited the [[West Indies]] with Charles, as it was thought the climate might benefit his ailing health. However, the visit proved ineffectual, and he died the following year. Her own health being also affected, Vaughan would publish no more novels, and only minimal writing for the remainder of her life. Her final piece of writing was an introduction to [[Thomas Traherne]]'s ''Centuries'' published in 1960, in which she offers an account of her religious faith in terms that are "quasi-mystical".<ref name="Newman pp. 81<U+2013>82.">Newman pp. 81<U+2013>82.</ref> In 1963 she was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]].<ref name=stephens />

Hilda Vaughan died on 4 November 1985 at a nursing home in [[Putney]], London, and was buried at Diserth, Radnorshire.<ref name=stephens />

Vaughan and her husband were survived by their daughter and son. The former married the Marquess of Anglesey in 1948, thereby becoming the Marchioness of Anglesey. Their son, Roger Morgan, is the former [[House of Lords Library|librarian of the House of Lords]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/lln-2011-024.pdf |title=History of the House of Lords Library |publisher=parliament.uk |accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Vaughan's work was favourably received by her contemporaries, and her works were reviewed by publications across the world.<ref name="Thomas 2008, p. 15.">Thomas 2008, p. 15.</ref> During her own lifetime her reputation was overshadowed by that of her husband,<ref name="Thomas 2008, p. 11.">Thomas 2008, p. 11.</ref> especially after the publication in 1932 of his novel ''[[The Fountain (novel)|The Fountain]]''.<ref name="Thomas 2006">{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Lucy|year=2006|chapter=Vaughan, Hilda 1892<U+2013>1985|title=Encyclopedia of British Women's Writing 1900-1950|editors=Faye Hammill, Ashlie Sponenberg and Esme Miskimmin|location=Houndsmill|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}</ref> However, her reputation declined towards the end of her life, and she has received minimal critical attention in subsequent years.<ref name="Newman p. 6.">Newman p. 6.</ref> As an example of her status, Vaughan's entry for the ''Encyclopedia of British Women's Writing 1900<U+2013>1950'' is as one of the "'recovered' writers", whose entries are briefer than the "better known writers".<ref name="Thomas 2006" /><ref name="Hammill p. xi.">Hammill p. xi.</ref>

For some time, Gustav Felix Adam<U+2019>s ''Three Contemporary Anglo-Welsh Novelists: Jack Jones, Rhys Davies and Hilda Vaughan'' (1950) constituted the last critical analysis of her work, and was not entirely complimentary.<ref name="Thomas 2008, p. 19.">Thomas 2008, p. 19.</ref> In Glyn Jones' ''The Dragon Has Two Tongues'' (1968), considered a seminal analysis of the tradition of [[Welsh literature in English]], Vaughan is mentioned only once, as one of those writers who "write about the [[Landed gentry|squirearchy]] and its anglicized apers".<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Glyn|title=The Dragon Has Two Tongues: Essays on Anglo-Welsh Writers and Writing|year=2001|publisher=U of Wales P|location=Great Britain|isbn=0-7083-1693-X|edition=Rev.|editor=Tony Brown}}</ref> A significant contribution to her legacy was Christopher Newman's biography of her, published in 1981. On this subject, Newman considers "her claims to be remembered <U+2026> are two: first she extended the English regional novel to the 'Southern Marches', to the land ''[[rhwng Gwy a Hafren]]''; secondly, that in doing so, she made a significant addition to Anglo-Welsh writing.<ref name="Newman p. 79.">Newman p. 79.</ref></blockquote> During the 1980s and 90s, Vaughan became incorporated into a renewed analysis of Anglo-Welsh writers and writing; concurrently, she was also considered as part of analysis of Welsh women's writing.<ref name="Thomas 2008, p. 20.">Thomas 2008, p. 20.</ref>
