'''Nayda Collazo-Llorens''' is a visual artist whose work spans drawing, painting, printmaking, installation, video, and public art. Her work combines images, sound, and text to investigate how the mind processes information. While themes of displacement, alienation, and synchronicity permeate her videos and interventions, her most recent text-based works explore post-alphabetic communication, hyperconnectivity and <U+201C>noise<U+201D> as systems of information.<ref>Artist statement, [http://www.lmakprojects.com/artists?id=7 LMAK projects]</ref> Collazo-Llorens is the granddaughter of the Puerto Rican literary critic, linguist, and lexicographer, [[Washington Llorens]]. Though born and raised in Puerto Rico, she attended college and graduate school in the United States, receiving her BFA in printmaking and graphic design from the Massachusetts College of Art in 1990 and her MFA from New York University in 2002. She has taught at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University School of Art, Kalamazoo College, and, from fall 2014, holds the position of Stuart and Barbara Padnos Distinguished Artist in Residence at Grand Valley State University. 

Exhibited throughout the United States, Latin America, Europe, and Puerto Rico, her work has been reviewed in the New York Times, Art Net, Art US, Art Nexus, Art News, Arte al Dia International, and BOMB Daily, among others. She has participated in the 12th International Media Art Biennale, Wroclaw, Poland (2007), the X Bienal de la Habana, Havana, Cuba (2009), and the Trienal Poli/Gr<U+00E1>fica de San Juan: <i>El Panal/The Hive,</i> San Juan, Puerto Rico (2012). In 2011, she was included in a major exhibition of Latin American art <U+2013> <i>Ya se leer: Imagen y texto en el arte latinoamericano</i> <U+2013> at the Centro de Arte Contempor<U+00E1>neo Wilfredo Lam, Havana, Cuba. Her work is represented by LMAK projects, New York.

==Early work and influences==
Nayda Collazo-Llorens worked as studio assistant to the conceptual artist [[Antoni Muntadas]] from 2001 until 2006. His interest in the relationship between public and private space and the ways in which channels of information are used to censor or promulgate ideas<ref>Antoni Muntadas, [http://act.mit.edu/people/professors/antoni-muntadas/ Faculty Profile], MIT Program in Art, Culture, and Technology, </ref> influenced the direction Collazo-Llorens would take her own work; but while Muntadas addresses social, political, and communication issues largely through a practice of visual appropriation, Collazo-Llorens maintains a practice of meditative and repetitive drawing through which she <U+201C>probes the processes of seeing, remembering, and communicating.<U+201D><ref name=autogenerated2>Deborah Cullen, <U+201C>Mindscapes by Nayda Collazo-Llorens: The Poetics of Opposition,<U+201D> companion essay to <i>Mindscapes at Space Other,</i> Boston, January, 2006, unpaginated.</ref>

Other influences include the non-linear narratives of authors such as [[Julio Cort<U+00E1>zar]], [[Mark Z. Danielewski]], and [[Don Delillo]], as well as theories of perception <U+2013> based on the dislocation of time and place through travel <U+2013> espoused by [[Wolfgang Schivelbusch]] and [[Mitchell Schwarzer]].<ref name=autogenerated1>Kathleen MacQueen, <U+201C>[http://www.naydacollazollorens.com/RCVA_COLLAZOLLORENS.pdf Nayda Collazo-Llorens: The Consistency of Chaos],<U+201D> a companion essay to the exhibition <i>An Exercise in Numbness & Other Tales,</i> Richmond Center for Visual Arts, September 6-October 5, 2012, unpaginated.</ref> Her interest in the non-hierarchical, rhizomatic arrangement of data is reflective of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari<U+2019>s emphasis on the nomadic nature of knowledge: <U+201C>To be rhizomorphous is to produce stems and filaments that seem to be roots, or better yet connect with them by penetrating the trunk, but put them to strange new uses.<U+201D><ref>Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, <i>A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,</i> trans. Brian Massumi (University of Minnesota Press, 1987).</ref> It is these <U+201C>strange new uses<U+201D> that infiltrate an art derived from her bifurcated existence between Puerto Rico and the United States. <U+201C>Collazo-Llorens builds a text of alienation <U+2013> of being alien,<U+201D> writes art critic and theorist Kathleen MacQueen, <U+201C>as an existential process of identifying what it means to be human.<U+201D><ref>Kathleen MacQueen, "Subtle Intensities of the Unexpected," [http://www.avideoshow.org/kathleenmacqueen/ <i>By Chance, A Video Show.</i>] 80WSE Galleries, 25 Jan. 2011.</ref>

==Works on paper and canvas==
An accomplished printmaker, Collazo-Llorens is, according to curator Deborah Cullen, <U+201C>a sophisticated draftsperson who<U+2026>has been producing personal, visceral drawings on a daily basis over several years. Small but intensely powerful, they are compact expressionistic worlds comfortable simultaneously in the language of the bodily and the schematic.<U+201D><ref>Deborah Cullen, <U+201C>Mindscapes by Nayda Collazo-Llorens: The Poetics of Opposition,<U+201D> companion essay to <i>Mindscapes at Space Other,<i> Boston, January, 2006, unpaginated.</ref> Curator Laura Roulet sees Collazo-Llorens<U+2019>s paintings as revealing <U+201C>a post-minimalist aesthetic, with the systematic organization of [[Hanne Darboven]] or [[Eva Hesse]], and the calligraphic mark making and erasures of [[Cy Twombly]] or [[Brice Marden]].<U+201D><ref>Laura Roulet, <U+201C>[http://project4gallery.com/exhibitions/nayda-collazo-llorens-navigable-zones/ Navigable Zones],<U+201D> a companion essay to the exhibition <i>Navigable Zones,</i> Project 4 Gallery, Washington, D.C., 2007, unpaginated.</ref> The methodology of these subjective and intimate drawings broadens into expansive mappings either on canvas or directly on the wall. Since 2012, her on-going <i>Test</i> series consist of map-like structures that function as systems of visual information while marks can be <U+201C>read<U+201D> as hyperlinked terrains or mindscapes.<ref>Nayda Collazo-Llorens [http://www.naydacollazollorens.com/canvas.htm website.]</ref> MacQueen sees <U+201C>this unfolding of space between geographical coordinates [as] an exposure of the vectors that chart personal experience.<U+201D><ref>Kathleen MacQueen, "Subtle Intensities of the Unexpected," [http://www.avideoshow.org/kathleenmacqueen/ <i>By Chance, A Video Show.]</i> 80WSE Galleries, 25 Jan. 2011.</ref>

==Video and installation==
For Collazo-Llorens drawing does not remain confined to or isolated by the sheet of paper or canvas but merges with mixed media and video into elaborate installations. Cullen understands Collazo-Llorens<U+2019>s installation work as a <U+201C><i>[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]</i>, or total work, in which all the individual pieces of the project relate to and amplify one another.<U+201D> In her <i>Unfolding the Triangle</i> <U+2013> a series of three separate installations representing different geographical areas, created in 2009, 2011, and 2012 <U+2013> <U+201C>directional lines, numerical symbols and words activate the space and engage the visitor in the unfolding, a situational mapping in which the viewer collaborates in <U+2018>reading<U+2019> the physical installation space.<U+201D><ref name=autogenerated2 />

<i>Unfolding the Triangle <U+2013> Lake Michigan</i> (2012) was included in a major solo exhibition of the artist<U+2019>s work at the Richmond Center for Visual Arts, Kalamazoo, Michigan, entitled <i>An Exercise in Numbness and Other Tales.</i>  Also included was an installation reflecting both the tradition of monumental history painting and media billboard display <U+2013> <i>Comfortably Numb</i> (2012) <U+2013> an archive of over 1,500 framed images collected from magazines and newspapers. Virginia Harbin appreciates this work as <U+201C>a collection not of hierarchical information, but rather an experiential archive of the everyday.<U+201D><ref>Virginia Allison Harbin, <U+201C>Navigating the Rhizomatic Archive: Temporal Leaps and Loops in Nayda Collazo-Llorens<U+2019> Recent Works,<U+201D> <i>ARC Magazine</i> May 2013: 16-23.</ref> Though the work references obsolete technology, it also intimates the barrage of images and words <U+201C>that comes through our digital devices, constantly pushing information,<U+201D> which is understood by the artist as being responsible for an increasingly fragmented and dissociated existence. In her video work, she expresses these ideas through non-linear means: for example, in <i>Reverb,</i> a 2012 site-specific video installation for <i>Medios y Ambientes,</i> Museo Universitario del Chopo in Mexico City, <U+201C>the idea of the loop is taken further by the fact that there are multiple video loops of different lengths that are engaged by the installation<U+2019>s video feedback. This effect repeats the video images exponentially and infinitely<U+2026>these repetitions layer and decay with every loop, to the point of being un-viewable/unreadable.<U+201D><ref>Nayda Collazo-Llorens in Virginia Allison Harbin, <U+201C>Navigating the Rhizomatic Archive: Temporal Leaps and Loops in Nayda Collazo-Llorens<U+2019> Recent Works,<U+201D> <i>ARC Magazine</i> May 2013: 16-23.</ref>

==Interventions and public art==
Though much of the artist<U+2019>s work considers the indiscriminate assortment of thought, memory, and data within a technological society, not all of it is existentially nihilistic. Recent work includes a temporary textual intervention on the paths of the Miami Beach Botanical Gardens based on testimonies collected from Miami Beach locals and visitors. Commissioned by the Bass Museum of Art, <i>Pleasure, Fear, and the Pursuit of Happiness</i> (2013), marks the pathways with dozens of colorful, round, text decals. The narrative of these <U+201C>sampled<U+201D> words and phrases serves more as a trigger for new thought than as a reservoir of random recollections. <i>Wave / Onda</i> (2004 to 2010) is the artist<U+2019>s first permanent public art installation. Created in collaboration with Toro Ferrer Architects for the University of Puerto Rico<U+2019>s General Studies building, it uses color to evoke a series of waves crossing the building<U+2019>s fa<U+00E7>ade, <U+201C>formally organizing this once haphazard access to the university grounds.<U+201D><ref>[http://www.toroferrer.com/home.html Toro Ferrer Arquitectos.]</ref>

<i>Revol<U+00FA>*tion</i> is a site-specific text-based work on the fa<U+00E7>ade of a chapel in San Juan, commissioned for the 3rd Poly/Graphic Triennial.<ref>Nayda Collazo-Llorens [http://www.naydacollazollorens.com/installationsrevolution.htm website.]</ref> It is solely composed of found text arbitrarily selected from Internet sites that cover the wall in what MacQueen refers to as <U+201C>a turbulence of conflicting verbal conditions.<U+201D><ref>Kathleen MacQueen, <U+201C>Ever Tried. Ever Failed. A Politics of Intimacy,<U+201D> a talk given at the School of Visual Arts, October 23, 2013.</ref> Cullen finds language to be <U+201C>a critical element in her works, [that] shifts easily between Spanish and English, and incorporates counterpoints that range from diaristic, poetic snippets to snatches from advertising, signage, or the news.<U+201D><ref name=autogenerated2 /> The context of her work, writes MacQueen, <U+201C>is the human psyche, disparate and unknowable, yet manifest in the actions we undertake.<U+201D><ref name=autogenerated1 /> Whether through visual or textual signs, throughout her work, there is a consistent emphasis on the relation between perception and the technological environment and its impact on human relations. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m neither critiquing technology nor supporting it,<U+201D> says the artist, <U+201C>rather, exploring the contemporary reality it has produced.<U+201D><ref>Nayda Collazo-Llorens quoted in Virginia Allison Harbin, <U+201C>Navigating the Rhizomatic Archive: Temporal Leaps and Loops in Nayda Collazo-Llorens<U+2019> Recent Works,<U+201D> <i>ARC Magazine</i> May 2013: 16-23.</ref>
