'''Paul S. Kromer''' (September 24, 1917 <U+2013> February 8, 2008) was an [[American football]] player.  A native of [[Lorain, Ohio]], Kromer enrolled at the [[University of Michigan]] where he played [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] for the [[Michigan Wolverines football]] teams from 1938 to 1927.  With Kromer at left halfback and [[Tom Harmon]] at right halfback, Michigan's backfield pair became known in 1938 as the "Touchdown Twins."

==Early years==
Kromer was born in [[Lorain, Ohio]] in approximately 1917.  His father, Frank T. Kromer, was an Ohio native and a motor man for an electric railway.  His mother, Olive Kromer, was also an Ohio native.<ref>Census entry for Frank T. Kromer and family. Ancestry.com. 1930 United States Federal Census [database on-line].

==University of Michigan==
Kromer enrolled at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1937.  He came to Michigan as a heralded football star from Ohio.<ref name=What>What It Means TO Be A Wolverine, by Kevin Allen, Nate Brown, and Art Regner, 2011, p. 9.</ref>  As a freshman in 1937, Kromer played for Michigan's All-Freshman football team.  

As a sophomore, Kromer was given jersey No. 83, the number assigned to one of Michigan's famed plays, and played left halfback for the [[1938 Michigan Wolverines football team]].  He became known as the "Lorain tornado."<ref>One Game Season, by Steve White, 2007, p. 125.</ref>  Under first-year head coach [[Fritz Crisler]], the 1938 Wolverines finished with a 6<U+2013>1<U+2013>1 record and outscored opponents 131 to 40.  Crisler called sophomores [[Tom Harmon]] and Kromer "the finest halfbacking combination he has ever coached."<ref name=CRIS>{{cite news|title=Crisler Calls Harmon and Kromer Best Backs He Has Ever Coached|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=October 7, 1939|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HKxQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UiIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4936,6669214&dq=paul-kromer&hl=en}}</ref>  Crisler called Kromer "the more instinctive runner of the two."<ref name=CRIS/>  Harmon and Kromer did much of the ball-carrying for Michigan in 1938, and some observers recalled that "Paul probably played as well, if not better, than Harmon."<ref name=What/>  A profile of Harmon and Kromer noted: "Kromer, 5 feet 10 and 160 pounds, is just the opposite.  He's the shifty type the kind who'll give you a leg and take it away while you're grabbing at thin air. ...  He's just as fast as Harmon and equally able on the pitching end of the pigskin."<ref name=CRIS/>  The backfield duo of Kromer and Harmon gave the Michigan offense a spark in 1938, as the two became known as the "Touchdown Twins."  ''The Michigan Alumnus'' in November 1940 recalled the efforts of Kromer and Harmon: "In that season of two years ago two boys flashed brilliantly across the gridiron horizon. Tom Harmon and Paul Kromer, Sophomores, halfbacks, teamed to give to Michigan the promise of the greatest backfield combination in football history."<ref name=GREAT>{{cite news|title=One of the Greatest Football Teams in All Michigan's Glorious Grid Iron History Ends Season By Crushing Ohio State by Overwhelming Score.

As a junior in 1937, Kromer was injured in the first game of the season with the result that "his football effectiveness was over" for the 1939 season.<ref name=GREAT/> He started only three games during the 1940 season.<ref>{{cite web|title=1939 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1939fbt.htm}}</ref>  Kromer left school for a time in the fall of 1939 after suffering his injury.  His departure led to speculation in the national media that he was leaving the Michigan football team, but he returned in late November and said he had gone home to get some money from his parents.<ref>{{cite news|title=Paul Kromer Back in Michigan Camp|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=November 22, 1939|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=u7NQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=USIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6652,5789483&dq=paul-kromer&hl=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Kromer Went Home To Get Some Money|newspaper=Youngstown Vindicator|date=November 22, 1939|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yi1KAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_oUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6678,6914587&dq=paul-kromer&hl=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Kromer Returns, Clears "Mystery"|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=November 21, 1939|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=k1cbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=akwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2016,1427052&dq=paul-kromer&hl=en}}</ref>

Kromer announced in the spring of 1940 that he intended to retire from active competition due to the knee injury he sustained in the 1939 season opener.<ref>{{cite news|title=Injury Wrecks Touchdown Duo|newspaper=The Miami News|date=May 7, 1940|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8gsvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XNgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3590,1714155&dq=paul+kromer+lorain+ohio&hl=en}}</ref> However, Kromer did return to football during the 1940 season. Though his playing time was limited, Kromer had the most spectacular play of his career in the final game of the 1940 season, Kromer's final appearance with the Michigan Wolverines. Playing against Ohio State in [[Columbus, Ohio]], Kromer got the start at left halfback. He returned a punt 80 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter, as the Wolverines shut out the Buckeyes 40 to 0. The 1940 Michigan team finished the season with a 7<U+2013>1 record and was ranked No. 3 in the final [[Associated Press]] poll.<ref>{{cite web|title=1940 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1940fbt.htm}}</ref> ''The Michigan Alumnus'' described Kromer's run as follows: "He grabbed Scott's fine punt on his own 20-yard line, feinted to the left and then cut over toward the center of the field. Harmon spilled the nearest Buckeye with a strenuous block and Rogers put another one out of action. Kolesar swung into action and two more Buckeyes went out of action. Wistert disposed of another <U+2014> and then it was just a case of Kromer's outrunning the hopelessly pursuing remainder. Though lacking about fifty percent of his old speed and agility, Kromer sped down the side of the field and over for the score <U+2014> the climax of his Varsity career."<ref name=GREAT/> The 1941 Michiganensian called him "the touchdown twin who came back despite a gelatin knee."<ref>1941 Michiganensian, p. 190.</ref>

==Military service and professional football==
In June 1941, Kromer joined the [[United States Navy]] and was appointed as an aviation cadet.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kromer in Navy|newspaper=Toledo Blade|date=June 28, 1941|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KMcwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Hv8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2189,4414937&dq=paul-kromer&hl=en}}</ref>  He was assigned to the athletic office at the Naval Air Station in [[Pensacola, Florida]].<ref name=Neck/>  He suffered a broken neck in an automobile accident near [[Tupelo, Mississippi]], on Christmas Eve 1941, and was hospitalized at the Marine Corps hospital at [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref name=Neck>{{cite news|title=Paul Kromer Injured: Former Michigan Grid Star Is Suffering From Broken Neck|newspaper=The Portsmouth Times|date=December 27, 1941|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YdhQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ac8MAAAAIBAJ&pg=1947,3155254&dq=paul-kromer&hl=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Pensacola Grid Star Injured|newspaper=Herald-Journal|date=December 27, 1941|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DFEsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2MoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2118,5651037&dq=paul-kromer&hl=en}}</ref>  In 1942, he was assigned to the Navy's inactive list because of the injuries he sustained in the accident.<ref name=Lio/>
