The hospital is named after Mazhar Osman, who is also considered as the founder of modern psychiatry in Turkey.<ref name="bh"/><ref name="h"/>

==History==
It was established with the initiative of Dr. [[Mazhar Osman]] (1884<U+2013>1951) and approval of [[Ministry of Health (Turkey)|Minister of Health]] [[Refik Saydam]] (1881<U+2013>1942) in the premises of Re<U+015F>adiye Barracks at [[Bak<U+0131>rk<U+00F6>y]], [[Istanbul]] on October 15, 1924.<ref name="bh"/><ref name="h"/><ref name="ref name="mm"/> It was an extension of Topta<U+015F><U+0131> Asylum, which was situated inside the Atik Valide Complex in [[<U+00DC>sk<U+00FC>dar]] on the Asian side of the city.<ref name="bh"/><ref name="h"/> After the completion of the mental hospital in Bak<U+0131>rk<U+00F6>y on June 15, 1927 and transfer of all the inpatients, Topta<U+015F><U+0131> Asylum closed.<ref name="bh"/><ref name="ref name="mm"/>

The facility in Bak<U+0131>rk<U+00F6>y was initially named Istanbul Hospital of Mental Disorders and Neurology ({{lang-tr|<U+0130>stanbul Emraz-<U+0131> Akliye ve Asabiye Hastanesi}}). The hospital was further developed by [[Fahrettin Kerim G<U+00F6>kay]] (1900<U+2013>1987), <U+015E><U+00FC>kr<U+00FC> Haz<U+0131>m Tiner, Ahmet <U+015E><U+00FC>kr<U+00FC> Emet and [[<U+0130>hsan <U+015E><U+00FC>kr<U+00FC> Aksel]] (1899<U+2013>1987), who all were students of Mazhar Osman.<ref name="bh"/> Main departments of the hospital was [[psychiatry]], [[neurology]] and [[neurosurgery]].<ref name="h"/> Mazhar Osman, who served as the hospital's chief physician until 1940, is the first in Turkey to apply [[brain surgery]].<ref name="bh"/>

With worsening of the economic situation in Turkey during the 1940s, the number of patients rose from 3,000 up to 5,000.<ref name="bh"/><ref name="h"/> Due to insufficient state budget, no other institutions could be established.<ref name="bh"/> These conditions led to the circumstance that many inpatients had to share the same beds.<ref name="bh"/> As a result, the mortality in the hospital increased.<ref name="bh"/>

The hospital complex underwent structural improvements such as in [[landscaping]] and renovation of the buildings.<ref name="bh"/> The inner courtyard was encircled by a {{convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on}}<U+2013>long wall.<ref name="bh"/> A copy of [[Auguste Rodin]]'s famous statue [[The Thinker]] was placed inside the courtyard, which became a symbol of psychiatry in Turkey.<ref name="bh"/> A second storey was added to some of wards.<ref name="bh"/>

In the 1960s, modern psychiatry methods were put into service.<ref name="bh"/> Inpatients were inspired to join newly-established various workshops for handcraft and outdoor sporting activities.<ref name="bh"/> Three types of treatment conditions were formed as open door, semi-open door and closed door services.<ref name="bh"/> As a remedy to the existing problem of overcapacity bedding, a mental health [[dispensary]] was opened in Istanbul, which was followed by more units throughout the city in later years.<ref name="bh"/>

In the 1980s, emphasis was placed on outpatient services by founding an outpatient psychiatric therapy unit as a countermeasure to the increasing number of patients.<ref name="bh"/><ref name="h"/> The number of inpatients could be held limited through shortened bedding time by speedy examination and effective treatment, as well as discharge of patients with better conditions outside.<ref name="bh"/> Efforts of the Chief physician [[Y<U+0131>ld<U+0131>r<U+0131>m Aktuna]] (1930<U+2013>2007) in fundraising played a major role in the improvement of the hospital's treatment and healthcare facilities.<ref name="bh"/><ref name="mm"/> In addition, scientific activities were initiated also in the hospital.<ref name="bh"/>

In the 1990s, the scientific work, which began in the former decade, continued when new services and equipment were introduced diversifying the specialization areas in psychiatry, neurology and neurosurgery.<ref name="bh"/><ref name="h"/> The "International Bak<U+0131>rk<U+00F6>y Days" were organized and brought to international level up.<ref name="bh"/> 

==Today==
The 2000s saw the establishment of many new units such as the centers for [[mood disorder]], [[substance dependence|drug addiction]] therapy, sleep and [[epilepsy]] research and [[psychosis|psychotic disorder]] as well as therapy and training centers for children and adolescents, for adolescents and young adults.<ref name="bh"/> 

Currently, the Bak<U+0131>rk<U+00F6>y Psychiatric Hospital is the country's largest and most developed health facility for mental disorders and neurology.<ref name="bh"/><ref name="h"/> It is also an important scientific institution in clinic research.<ref name="bh"/> [[Physician assistant]]s are educated in the neurology clinic since the department's foundation in 1927.<ref name="mm"/> Ten academic staff personnel serve in the neurology clinic.<ref name="mm"/>
