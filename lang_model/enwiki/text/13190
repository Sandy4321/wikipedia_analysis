'''Shenandoah''' is a [[Grammy Award]]-winning American [[country music]] band known for its [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]-influenced [[neotraditionalist country]] sound. It was founded in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]] in 1984 by [[Marty Raybon]] (lead vocals, [[acoustic guitar]]), Ralph Ezell ([[bass guitar]], backing vocals), Stan Thorn ([[keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), Jim Seales ([[lead guitar]], backing vocals), and Mike McGuire ([[Drum kit|drums]], background vocals). Ezell was replaced by Rocky Thacker in 1996, shortly before the band broke up and Raybon pursued a solo career as a country-gospel artist. Seals, Thacker and McGuire re-established the band in 2000 with keyboardist Stan Munsey and vocalists [[Curtis Wright]] and Brent Lamb. Ezell later rejoined on bass, with Mike Folsom taking over after Ezell's 2007 death, and following Lamb's and Wright's departures, Jimmy Yeary became the fourth lead vocalist.

Shenandoah has released nine [[studio album]]s, of which two have been certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. The band has also charted twenty-six [[single (music)|singles]] on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including the Number One hits "[[The Church on Cumberland Road]]," "[[Sunday in the South]]" and "[[Two Dozen Roses]]" from 1989, "[[Next to You, Next to Me]]" from 1990, and "[[If Bubba Can Dance (I Can Too)]]" from 1994. The late 1994-early 1995 single "Somewhere in the Vicinity of the Heart," which featured guest vocals from [[Alison Krauss]], won both artists a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals.

[[Lead guitar]]ist Jim Seales and [[drummer]] Mike McGuire formed Shenandoah in 1984 as a house band in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], with [[bass guitar]]ist Ralph Ezell and [[keyboardist]] Stan Thorn, as well as lead singer [[Marty Raybon]], who had been in his father's [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] band since childhood.<ref name="gibson">{{cite web |url=http://www.gibson.com/player/apr03/raybon.html |title=Marty Raybon scratches his bluegrass itch |accessdate=2009-10-12 |last=Nikolai |first=Michelle |work=Gibson Guitar Corporation}}</ref> McGuire invited songwriting friend Robert Byrne to one of the session band's shows.

===1987{{ndash}}1990: ''Shenandoah'' and ''The Road Not Taken''===
In 1987, Shenandoah released its [[Shenandoah (album)|self-titled]] debut [[studio album]], which Byrne and Rick Hall produced.

''[[The Road Not Taken (Shenandoah album)|The Road Not Taken]]'' was the band's second album, released in 1988.
