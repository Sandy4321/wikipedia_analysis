'''''Mastiglanis asopos''''' is a [[species]] of [[three-barbeled catfish]].  It is the only recognized species in its genus.

This species has a broad distribution, mainly throughout the left side tributaries of the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] basin and the [[Capim River]] basin in [[Brazil]], as well as in the right tributaries of the Amazon basin in Brazil, [[Orinoco]] basin of [[Venezuela]], and drainages in [[Guyana]].<ref name="Zuanon"/>

''M. asopos'' is a strictly sand-dwelling species. It spends the daytime buried in the top layer of sand.<ref name="Zuanon"/> It forages mostly at night and sometimes in the morning. As an [[ambush predator]], when foraging, it poises in the streamlet channel where water is flowing, supported by a [[tripod]] formed by its [[fish anatomy#Fins|pelvic]] and [[fish anatomy#Fins|anal fins]], spreading both its very long [[barbel (anatomy)|barbels]] and the filamentous [[fish anatomy#Fins|dorsal]] and [[fish anatomy#Fins|pectoral-fin rays]], thus forming a kind of "drift-trap". When the fish intercepts food, it will lunge at these food particles; after lunging for a short distance, it will return to its previous hunting spot. This behavior is similar to that seen in the [[tripod fish]].<ref name="Zuanon">{{cite journal|journal=Neotropical Ichthyology|volume=4|issue=1|pages=107<U+2013>118|year=2006|title=A remarkable sand-dwelling fish assemblage from central Amazonia, with comments on the evolution of psammophily in South American freshwater fishes|first=Jansen|last=Zuanon|coauthors=Bockmann, Fl<U+00E1>vio A.; Sazima, Ivan}}</ref> Small [[trichoptera]]n [[larva]]e (ingested with the sand cases) and [[ephemeroptera]]ns constituted a considerable portion of the gut contents in a study of ''Mastiglanis asopos'', but their foraging behavior allows a varied diet which includes large [[chironomidae|chironomid]] larvae and small adult [[beetle]]s that would not be consumed by other sand-dwelling animals.<ref name="Zuanon"/>
