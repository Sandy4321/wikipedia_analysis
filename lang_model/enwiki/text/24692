'''Harry McLeary Wurzbach''' (May 19, 1874 <U+2013> November 6, 1931) was the first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] to represent [[Texas]] for more than two terms in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. Rep. [[Robert B. Hawley]] had previously served as a Republican for a Galveston based congressional district from 1897-1901. He held [[Texas's 14th congressional district]] seat from 1921<U+2013>1929 and from 1930<U+2013>1931.

== Early life ==
Wurzbach was born in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] to Charles Louis Wurzbach and the former Kate Fink. He attended public schools and graduated in 1896 from [[Washington and Lee University School of Law]] in [[Lexington, Virginia]]. That same year, he was admitted to the bar, established his practice in San Antonio, and married the former Frances Darden Wagner. Wurzbach volunteered as a private in Company F, First Regiment, Texas Volunteer Infantry during the [[Spanish-American War]]. After the war, he relocated to [[Seguin, Texas|Seguin]] and continued his law practice. He was the [[Guadalupe County, Texas|Guadalupe County]] [[prosecuting attorney]] from 1900<U+2013>1902 and County Judge from 1904<U+2013>1910.

== Political career ==
First elected to Congress in the [[general election]] of 1920, Wurzbach unseated the freshman [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Representative [[Carlos Bee]] of San Antonio, 17,265 (55.6 percent) to 13,777 (44.4 percent). In 1922, 1924, and 1926, Wurzbach won by margins of 54.8, 62.4, and 57.2 percent, respectively. He won his seat even as the Republican presidential candidates in 1920 and 1924 were losing the [[electoral vote]] of Texas. Wurzbach was a delegate to the [[1924 Republican National Convention]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. 

In 1928, Wurzbach lost reelection even though Republican [[Herbert Hoover]] won Texas over Democratic candidate [[Al Smith]]. Wurzbach polled 27,206 (49.7 percent) to 29,055 (50.3 percent) for the Democrat [[Augustus McCloskey]] of San Antonio. Wurzbach claimed irregularities in the election and appealed his case to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. The House ultimately reversed McCloskey's election (after eleven months of congressional service) and seated Wurzbach on February 10, 1930. Wurbach then won another term in November 1930, when he polled an impressive 27,206 (59.3 percent) to Democrat Henry B. Dielmann's 18,707 (40.7 percent).

== Wurzbach's legacy ==
Wurzbach was the only representative from Texas to vote for the [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill]] in 1922. 

Wurzbach served until his death in San Antonio in 1931. He is buried in the [[San Antonio National Cemetery]].

Wurzbach, of German extraction (see also [[Wurzbach]], [[Germany]]), was the first native Texan to win election to Congress as a Republican. After Wurzbach, no other Republicans represented Texas in Congress until 1950, when [[Ben H. Guill|Ben Guill]] was elected.

Former Democratic Congressman [[Bob Eckhardt]] of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] was a nephew of Wurzbach.

Wurzbach Road, Harry Wurzbach Road, and [[Wurzbach Parkway]] in San Antonio honor his memory.
