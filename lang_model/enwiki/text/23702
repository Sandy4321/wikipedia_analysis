'''Glenn Gilberti''' (born [[November 12]], [[1968]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], best known for his appearances with [[World Championship Wrestling]] as '''Disco Inferno'''.

==Career==
After graduating from [[Marist High School]],Gilberti started wrestling in 1991 on the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] independent circuit.

Gilberti made his name in [[World Championship Wrestling]] as '''Disco Inferno'''. He annoyed fans with his [[disco]] dancer character (which included dancing on the way to the ring and in between moves during matches) and rose to mid-card status as a [[Tweener (professional wrestling)|tweener]]. His stay in WCW included a feud with [[Jacqueline Moore|Jacqueline]], which caused him to briefly leave WCW in a dispute over being pinned by a woman. He was in a tag team with [[Alex Wright]] called the "Dancing Fools" and "Boogie Knights" at various times. He was a regular guest on [[WCW Live!]] where he would tell off-color jokes and pitch ideas about evolving his character. He would extend this persona on screen to where he would try to reference [[pop culture]] in his [[promo (professional wrestling)|promos]] looking to get a [[pop (professional wrestling)|pop]] or a laugh, but was unsuccessful more often than not. He was also a member of [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo Wolfpac]] and a member of the [[Filthy Animals]] near WCW's last days as "Disqo". 

In the late 1990s into the early 2000s, he also appeared on WCW Announcer [[Mark Madden]]'s sports radio talk show on ESPN Radio 1250 in Pittsburgh as "Mr. Friday Afternoon", usually in an extended routine which involved Glenn's football picks and Mark's allusions to Glenn's drug problems. 

Gilberti then went on to join [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]], changing his alias to his real name. He was a member of [[Sports Entertainment Xtreme|S.E.X.]] and even became their leader near the end of that angle. He was also a member of the New York Connection (also known as the "N-Y-C") with [[Vito LaGrasso|Big Vito]], [[Joseph Dorgan|Johnny Swinger]] and [[Stephanie Finochio|Trinity]].

In [[2005]], he went back to working the independent circuit in Georgia and Minnesota. He also wrestled for the Southern Wrestling Alliance and [[Vince Russo]]'s [[Ring Of Glory]].
