'''Eastern Methodist Cemetery''', also known as '''Old Ebenezer Cemetery'' and '''Ebenezer Cemetery'', was a {{convert|4|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[cemetery]] located in the [[Barney Circle]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]], in the United States. 

It was founded in 1824 as a privately-owned [[Methodism|Methodist]] cemetery open to the public.<ref name=oldeben>{{cite news|title=The Old Ebenezer Burial Ground|newspaper=The Evening Star|date=September 29, 1892|page=5}}</ref>{{sfn|Proctor|Black|Williams|1930|page=538}} (The earliest internment at Eastern Methodist came before the cemetery was incorporated. That was Ely Drown, who was buried there on August 18, 1823.)<ref name=trouble /> Its owner was the Fourth Street Methodist Church at Ebenezer Station (hence the nickname "Ebenezer Cemetery"). The cemetery was located one a city block bounded by D, E, 17th, and 18th Streets NE.<ref name=oldeben /> It was across the street from and north of [[Congressional Cemetery]].<ref name=oldeben />{{sfn|Proctor|Black|Williams|1930|page=538}} The cemetery was designed to hold 1,830 burial plots.<ref name=oldeben /> But because of the cemetery's popularity, there were multiple burials in each grave, and by the 1890s the cemetery held more than 3,000 bodies.<ref name=trouble /><ref name=oldeben />

During the roughly 70 years in which the cemetery was in operation, many of the leading citizens of the Barney Circle, [[Capitol Hill]], [[Kingman Park]], and [[Atlas District]] were buried at Eastern Methodist Cemetery. The cemetery was never in good financial condition, however. The price of burial plots was too low to permit the cemetery to establish a perpetual care fund.<ref name=trouble /> 

Eastern Methodist Cemetery was built on marshy ground, however, and it was not very suitable as a burial ground. About 1890, the cemetery's trustees proposed closing the cemetery. To finance the disinterral of remains, the cemetery would be subdivided and sold for building lots. Lotholders, however, rejected the proposal. The trustees then sought a legal solution. In 1891, Congress enacted legislation allowing Eastern Methodist Cemetery to remove all bodies in the cemetery and subdivide and sell the land to finance their reinterrment elsewhere.<ref name=trouble>{{cite news|title=Trouble Over the Dead|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 4, 1892|page=5}}</ref> Some remains were claimed by family members. The Fourth Street Methodist Church agreed to disinter and box these remains, and reinter them at church expense at whatever local cemetery the family chose. Remains which went unclaimed were interred in mass graves at Congressional Cemetery.<ref name=oldeben /> Although there initially was opposition among lotholders against the cemetery's closure,<ref name=trouble /> no lawsuit emerged.<ref name=backtomb />

Disinterrals commenced at the cemetery on October 1, 1892.<ref name=backtomb>{{cite news|title=Back From the Tomb|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 4, 1892|page=8}}</ref> By October 4, about 50 bodies had been removed from Eastern Methodist Cemetery, and cemetery officials were predicting that the cemetery would be cleared by the end of the year.<ref name=trouble /> Cemetery officials said that they had located nearly every grave listed in the cemetery's lotbook, and full clearance of bodies from the grounds was almost certain. As of November 3, about 1,000 bodies remained to be unearthed, but officials said they were sure to have the work finished within three more weeks.<ref name=backtomb />
