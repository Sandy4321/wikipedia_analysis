'''Malvern''' is a [[town]] and [[civil parish]] in [[Worcestershire]], [[England]]. It includes the major centre of population [[Great Malvern]] on the steep eastern flank of the [[Malvern Hills]], together with many suburbs and areas often collectively referred to  as ''The Malverns''. Several of these settlements are separated by large tracts of open [[common land]]. The civil parish of Malvern Town Council has a population of 28,749 ([[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]]<ref>[http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=800846&c=Malvern&d=16&e=15&g=499174&i=1001x1003x1004&o=1&m=0&enc=1&dsFamilyId=779 Neighbourhood Statistics, UK gov.]</ref>).

Malvern is the largest town in the [[parliamentary constituency]] of [[West Worcestershire (UK Parliament constituency)|West Worcestershire]]. As of May 2005 it is represented by Sir [[Michael Spicer]]. Malvern is also the administrative seat of the area governed by [[Malvern Hills (district)|Malvern Hills District Council]] (MHDC) and lies adjacent to the [[Malvern Hills AONB|Malvern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]. The MHDC also governs several neighbouring towns<ref>[[Malvern Hills (district)|Malvern Hills Distric Council]] web site</ref> and a great many villages.

==Suburbs==
Besides the town centre of Great Malvern, Malvern comprises a number of areas and other named places.
<br>Some are within the civil parish of Malvern Town, and all are in the surrounding urban area. The names and locations of these suburbs are in general usage but, except where some of the outer suburbs correspond to [[civil parish]]es,  Malvern as a name on  its own is unparished and is informally defined. The six Malvern Town Council electoral [[Ward (politics)|ward]]s at the lowest level of local government generally ignore the accepted suburbs and use invented names: Chase, Dyson Perrins, Link, North Malvern, Pickersleigh, and Priory, and correspond to the limits of the civil parish  of Malvern Town, (ward 06 of the Malvern Hills District).<ref>[http://www.malverntowncouncil.org/councillors.php Ward map of Malvern Town Council]</ref>

==History==
{{Expand-section|date=May 2009}}
The name Malvern probably comes from the ancient [[British language (Celtic)|British language]] meaning 'Bare-Hill', the nearest modern equivalent being the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] 'Moelfryn' (meaning 'bald hill'). Ancient legends have it that the [[British Iron Age|British]] chieftain [[Caractacus]] took his last stand against the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] on the [[Malvern Hills]], but this has been disputed in modern times. 

The [[medieval]] poem [[Piers Plowman]] begins on the Malvern hillside. Starting from the [[Middle Ages]], Malvern was the site of a [[Benedictine]] [[monastery]] which first arose in 1085 from a [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] endowed by [[Edward the Confessor]], of which, beside [[Malvern Priory]] [[church (building)|church]], part survives as Malvern Museum. This building dates back to about 1470. Back in the 12th century [[Walcher of Malvern|Walcher]] (the second [[Prior]] of Malvern) was a notable [[astronomer]] and [[mathematician]] - his gravestone inside the priory church records this fact.

Malvern is a famous [[destination spa|spa]], known for its bottled water since 1622 at the Holy Well and later from other spouts and sources. Dr. [[James Manby Gully]] made the "water cure" popular in the early 19th century. Several hotels in Great Malvern date from the hey-day of Malvern as a residential spa.

The Emperor of [[Ethiopia]], [[Haile Selassie]], spent some of his exile here, in the Abbey Hotel.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/westmidlands/series2/haile_selassie_malvern.shtml BBC Inside Out - Haile Selassie]</ref>

==Governance==
{{rellink|See also [[Malvern Hills (district)]]}}

Malvern Hills is an administrative district of the County of Worcestershire, and comprises 54 civil parishes and 21 electoral council wards.

==Population development==
The area remained a cluster of small villages until the early 1800s, when the 'taking of the water' in Malvern became popularised by Dr. Wall in 1756. By the 1820s the Baths and the Pump Room were opened and  Dr James Wilson and Dr  Gully 1842 opened up  water cure establishments in the town centre. 

By the middle of the 19th century with the arrival of the railway, bath houses, and other establishments catering for the health tourists had flourished. By the early 20th century Malvern had rapidly developed from a small village centred around its priory, to  a bustling  town with  many  large hotels, and impressive [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian]] country villas of the newly rich citizenry  of the the [[Industrial Revolution]] from nearby [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]].

Malvern experienced a further boost to its population in 1942 when a large government research faciity was relocated from the south of England to Malvern for safety from [[air raids]] and espionage during [[World War II]]. In the early 1950s several large and (at that time) modern [[housing estates]] were built in  Malvern on similar lines to [[council estates]] to  provide accommodation for the staff and their families. A significant proportion  of the population of Malvern today is comprised of present and former employees and their successive families, and of its previously attached military contingent. 

Malvern had already become an overspill for the nearby city of Worcester, and the new motorways constructed in the early 1960s brought the industrial Midlands within commuting distance and with it, the construction of large private housing developments.
Malvern continues to swell, as increasingly more farmland especially on the line between the villages of Guarlford and Newland is turned over to new housing projects since the beginning of the 21st century, creating brand new communities and suburbs yet to be named.

'''Private Education''' is especially represented in Malvern by two famous [[public school]]s, [[Malvern College]] founded in  1865, and [[Malvern Girls College]] now renamed [http://www.malvernstjames.co.uk/ Malvern St. James] after its 2006 merger with St. James's School. There are also many other private day and boarding schools. Famous people who were educated at these schools include [[Jeremy Paxman]], [[A.J.P. Taylor]], [[C. S. Lewis]], [[Denholm Elliott]], [[Barbara Cartland]], and [[Aleister Crowley]].

'''Automobiles''' have been contructed in Malvern since 1910 <ref>[http://www.morgan-motor.co.uk/about_morgan/1910.html Morgan website. Retrieved 19 May 2009]</ref> by The [[Morgan Motor Company]], one of the world's longest existing private constructors of series-built automobiles.  The Morgan Motor Car is a traditional [[sports car]] [[roadster]] and over the years has become a 'cult' vehicle, exported all over the world. 

'''[[Pipe organ]] building''' has been carried out in Malvern since the famous company  of Nicholson Organs was founded by John Nicholson in 1841. The Nicholson company is one of the most innovative in the field of organ technology and the firm's organs can be found in Worcester, Gloucester and Birmingham (UK) Cathedrals, and abroad in Madrid, Hong Kong and Long Island, U.S.A.<ref>[http://malvern.whub.org.uk/home/mhcindex/mhc-businit/mhc-businit-experience/mhc-businit-nicholson.htm Organ building] Malvern Hills District Council.

'''Glassware''' is produced by [[Chance Brothers]], an early pioneer of glass making technology, in their factory in Malvern next door to the Morgan Motor works.

===Malvern Water===
{{main | Malvern Water}}
The [[Malvern Water]] became famous for containing "nothing at all". It was the main reason for Malvern becoming a spa town and has formed a part of both local and national culture since [[Queen Elizabeth I]] made a point of drinking it in public in the 16th century, and [[Queen Victoria]] refused to travel without it. It is the only bottled water used by [[Queen Elizabeth II]], which she takes on her travels around the world.<ref>[http://malvern.whub.org.uk/home/mhcindex/mhc-businit/mhc-businit-exper0ience/mhc-businit-cocacola.htm Malvern water] Malvern Hills District Council. Retrieved 20 May 200</ref> Millions of litres of [[Malvern Water]] are bottled annually by [[Schweppes]] in a factory near Malvern and distributed worldwide.

===Music===
'''Sir Edward [[Elgar]]''', the famous British composer and ''Master of the King's Musick'' lived much  of his life around Malvern and is buried in Little Malvern cemetery. 
There is evidence to suggest{{Fact|date=May 2009}} that Elgar composed part of the [[Enigma Variations]] in All Saint's, the parish church of [[Malvern Wells]], but his offer of the original manuscript of his oratorio ''The Apostles'', as a gift to the church, was refused by the [[Anglican]] church authorities because Elgar was a [[Roman Catholic]] and the oratorio was heavily based in that tradition.  ''[[Land of Hope and Glory]]'', set to Elgar's [[Pomp and Circumstance]] March No. 1, and often used as a national anthem for England,<ref>Anthem 4 England - [http://anthem4england.co.uk/modules/news/article.php?storyid=1 Land of Hope and Glory]</ref><ref>[http://blog.wonkosworld.co.uk/2006/03/bbc-survey-on-english-national-anthem.html BBC survey on English national anthem]</ref>  was first performed in the Wyche School next to  the church in the presence of Elgar. 

A statue of Elgar stands gazing over [[Great Malvern]] from Belle Vue Terrace in the town centre. The ''Elgar Route'', a 40-mile drive passing some key landmarks from Elgar's life, passes through Malvern.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/herefordandworcester/content/articles/2007/05/09/elgar_route_feature.shtml Elgar Trail map]</ref>

===Dramatic Arts===
====Mainstream Theatre====
Malvern is a leading provincial centre for theatre<ref>http://www.malvern-theatres.co.uk Malvern Theatre web site</ref>.The theatre is housed in the Malvern Winter Gardens complex.
The first Malvern Drama Festival<ref>Gerald Morice 1979: ''A Brief History of the Malvern Festival Theatre''</ref> was planned by Sir Barry Jackson and took place in 1929 and was dedicated to [[Bernard Shaw]]. Many  premiers of works by famous playwrites had their first performances at Malvern, including two by Bernard Shaw. In 1956, on the occasion of the dramatist's 100th birthday, Malvern held a Shaw centenary week.

In February 1965 a Malvern Festival Theatre Trust was set up, and extensive refurbishment  was undertaken. [[J B Priestley]] presided over the opening ceremony of the first summer season. In 1998 a further <U+00A3>7.2 million major redesign and refurbishment took place with the help of contributions from the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|The National Lottery Distribution Fund (NLDF)]], administered by the government Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

====Fringe Festival====

These are accompanied by musical and other live events throughout the year.

===Malvern in Literature===
[[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] used to walk on the [[Malvern Hills]]. The story goes that, after drinking in a Malvern pub one winter evening, they were walking home when it started to snow. They saw a lamp post shining out through the snow and Lewis turned to his friends and said "that would make a very nice opening line to a book". Lewis' book ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' later used that image as the characters enter the realm of [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]].

The poet [[W. H. Auden]] taught for three years in the 1930s at the [[The Downs School (Herefordshire)|The Downs School]], in the Malvern Hills. He wrote many poems there, including: ''This Lunar Beauty''; ''Let Your Sleeping Head''; ''My Love, Fish in the Unruffled Lakes''; and ''Out on the Lawn I Lie in Bed''. He also wrote the long poem about the hills and their views, called simply ''The Malverns''

[[William Langland]]'s The famous 14th century poem ''The Visions of [[Piers Plowman]]'' (1362) was inspired by  the [[Malvern Hills]] and The earliest poetical allusion to them occurs in the poem:<ref>W. W. Skeat (1886): ''Langland, Piers the Plowman'' Clarendon Press</ref> ''And on a Maye mornynge on Malverne hylles''. William Langland, the reputed writer, was possibly educated at the priory of Great Malvern. Several roads and buildings in Malvern are named after Langland.

===Agriculture===
Malvern is the centre for a significant [[agricultural industry]] in the area immediately  surrounding  the town, essentially comprising [[mixed farming]] (livestock, dairy, cereals, and [[market gardening]]). Sheep graze on the hills immediately to the west of the town centre, and on  the [[common land]] that separates the various urban centres. Significant crops are fruit (apples, cider apples, pears, damsons, plums), vegetables, and the monoculture of hops and Christmas trees.

The [http://www.threecounties.co.uk/ Three Counties Showground], a few miles to the south of Malvern on the road to the town of [[Upton upon Severn]] (part of the Malvern District), is the venue for the famous annual Three Counties Show held each year in  June, which while traditionally representing the three counties of [[Worcestershire]], [[Herefordshire]] and [[Gloucestershire]], it is one of the country's most important [[agricultural show]]s and events. It also hosts the Spring Gardening Show, and many other events throughout the year including regular [[Royal Horticultural Society]] Gardening Shows.

==Health Facilities==
A hospital in the  town centre, built in 1911, now serves mainly for the elderly and convalescence although consultants from major Worcester [[NHS]] hospitals hold clinics there. Work on a new hospital for the area began in early 2009 away  from the town centre.<ref>NHS Executive Summary 12 March 2009</ref> In 2006 a large, modern health complex was opened on the edge of Malvern Link from which a large GPs practice now operates.

==Employment and Scientific Research==
Apart from working in its hospitality industry, schools, local services, and a modern commercial estate for small factories and warehouses and its nearby  retail park, most town residents commute either to the nearby city of Worcester or to the vast agglomeration of [[Birmingham]] - [[Wolverhampton]] at  less than forty minutes by train or motorway. The major single employer is [[QinetiQ]], a scientific research  facility. Outside the town, many people are employed in the important farming community.

===QinetiQ===

*[[DERA]] Defence Evaluation & Research Agency April 1995 July 2001
*[[QinetiQ]] & [[DSTL]] July 2000 - present
</ref>, with about 2,300 employees, the centre has remained the largest single employer in the Malvern area to the present day. Primarily concerned with defence technology, some of which is top secret, the organisation has been administered over the years by several government ministries. Notable major  contributions to global science and technology include [[RADAR]], the cavity [[magnetron]], and [[liquid crystal displays]] (LCD).
It has been said that [[World War II]] was won on the playing fields of Malvern, home of the [[cavity magnetron]]; from a building that still exists today<ref>[http://www.lhi.org.uk/docs/Draft_Guarlford_Parish_Walk_Two.doc | Guarlford Parish Walks]</ref> that housed a radio  listening  post in the hamlet of Guarlford near the TRE South Site, TRE was also instrumental in providing the RAF with the location of [[Peenem<U+00FC>nde]], the [[V2 rocket]] base in [[Germany]] that that was subsequently bombed by the RAF in the [[World War II]] [[Operation Crossbow]].

In 2001 the facility was partly privatised ([[QinetiQ]]) to  become a world leader in electronics and telecommunications research while a part was retained by the Ministry of Defence to become [[Dstl]], the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory. Malvern's Dstl contingent has since closed down<ref>[[Dstl]]</ref> with a tiny number of the few remaining staff moving to other Dstl sites.

Different generations of Malvern people often still refer to the establishment by any of its former names.
