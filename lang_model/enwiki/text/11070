'''''The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse''''' is a children's book written and illustrated by [[Beatrix Potter]], and first published by [[Frederick Warne & Co]]. in [[1910 in literature|1910]]. Mrs. Tittlemouse is a [[wood mouse|wood-mouse]] whose efforts to keep her home in a bank under a hedge tidy are thwarted by insect intruders. After Mr. Jackson, a [[toad]], removes an unwanted nest of bees from a storeroom, Mrs. Tittlemouse gives her dwelling a thorough spring cleaning, polishes her little tin spoons, and invites her friends to a party.

In 1909, Mrs. Tittlemouse made her debut in ''[[The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies]]'', and, the following year, became the heroine of her own book. The tale reflects Potter's pride in her own home, [[Hill Top Farm]], and her pleasure in keeping her home tidy. Critically, the book is appreciated today for Potter's meticulous depictions of the intrusive insects rather than the humanized Mrs. Tittlemouse, Mr. Jackson, and the party guests. Potter has been charged with drawing the insects simply for their own sake, or to produce an effect of horror and disgust in her readers.  In 1992, the book was adapted as an episode in the animated television series, ''[[The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends]]''.

== Plot ==
Mrs. Tittlemouse lives in a "funny house" of extensive passages and storerooms in a bank under a hedge. She tries to keep her house tidy but insect intruders leave dirty footprints on the floors and a variety of messes about the place. Several interlopers are given short shrift and turned away with little ceremony. In a distant passage, she meets a bumble bee, and, in an unused storeroom, discovers a nest of bees, whom she is unable to expel. Upon returning to her parlour, she finds her toad neighbour Mr. Jackson sitting in her rocking chair, all wet and dripping. He stays for dinner, but the food is not to his pleasing, and he rummages about the cupboard searching for the honey he can smell. When Mr. Jackson finds the bees, he makes a dreadful mess pulling out their nest. Mrs. Tittlemouse takes refuge in a storeroom and, when she peeps out, discovers everybody has gone away. She spends a fortnight spring cleaning, remodels her front entry to keep Mr. Jackson outside, and holds a party for five other little wood-mice. Mr. Jackson is forced to sit outside drinking honeydew, but takes no offence with being excluded from the parlour.

== Composition and publication ==

Potter was an unsentimental naturalist who thought no creature either good or bad, and had no qualms describing [[earwig]]s in Mrs. Tittlemouse's passage or [[woodlice]] in her pantry, but her publisher Harold Warne &ndash; always sensitive to the public's reaction &ndash; had different ideas about what was appropriate for a children's book. Though he had become accustomed to Potter's unusual choice of animal subjects through the years, it was thought she had gone a bit too far in ''Mrs. Tittlemouse'' with the woodlice and the earwig.  The earwig was transmogrified into a beetle and the woodlice into "creepy-crawly people".<ref>Taylor, pp. 143-4</ref> Potter argued for the generic term "slaters" for the woodlice, but was overruled.<ref>Lear, p. 234</ref>

The tale was written in a small leather-covered notebook as a New Year's gift for Warne's youngest daughter, Nellie, and was published in a trade edition in July 1910. Potter was pleased with the bound copies she received, and thought the book would be popular with little girls.  Her father Rupert wrote the Warne girls that he thought his daughter's sense of humour ever-fresh and never dull.<ref>Lear, p. 235</ref>

== Characters ==
In 1909, '''Mrs. Thomasina Tittlemouse''' debuted in ''[[The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies]]''. There, she rescued the six Flopsy Bunnies from [[Mr. McGregor]] by nibbling a hole in the sack where he had put them.  In gratitude, the bunnies  sent her a quantity of rabbit wool from which she fashioned a cloak and muff. In 1910, Mrs. Tittlemouse was given her own book and is described there as a "most terribly tidy little mouse always sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors" in the "yards and yards" of passages and storerooms, nut-cellars, and seed-cellars in her home amongst the roots of a hedge. She has a kitchen, a parlour, a pantry, a larder, and a bedroom where she keeps her dust-pan and brush next to her little box bed.  She fears she "shall go distracted" as a result of the hubbub produced in her house when Mr. Jackson rummages about looking for honey. Exhausted, she goes to bed wondering if her house will ever be tidy again. Mr. Tittlemouse is never mentioned.

[[File:Mr. Jackson in Mrs Tittlemouse.jpg|thumb|left|Mr. Jackson sits in Mrs. Tittlemouse's rocking chair with his feet on the fender. Like Mrs. Tittlemouse (but unlike the insects), Mr. Jackson is humanized: he wears clothes and walks upright on his hind legs.]]

'''Mr. Jackson''' is a toad who lives in "a drain below the hedge, in a very dirty wet ditch". His coat tails drip with water and he leaves wet footmarks on Mrs. Tittlemouse's parlour floor.  She follows him about with a mop and dish-cloth. He rummages in the cupboard looking for the honey he can smell.  He eventually rids the house of am unwanted bees' nest in the storeroom. Mrs. Tittlemouse remodels her front entry to keep him out, but he takes no offense and enjoys her party by sitting outside drinking honeydew from acorn cups passed to him through the window.

'''Babbitty Bumble''' is a [[bumble bee]] who has taken up residence in Mrs. Tittlemouse's empty storeroom &ndash; much to the homeowner's annoyance. Mr. Jackson snaps her up but spits her out, complaining of her bristles. When he clears the storeroom of a bee nest, Babitty is never seen or mentioned again.

The '''insect intruders''' in Mrs. Tittlemouse's home are a [[beetle]] lost in a passage, a [[ladybird]] ("little old woman in a red, spotty cloak"), a "big bold [[spider]]" seeking shelter from the rain, bees nesting in a storeroom, three [[woodlice]] ("creepy crawly people") hiding in the plate-rack, and a [[Red Admiral]] butterfly in the sugar bowl.  The [[nursery rhymes]] "[[Ladybird, Ladybird]]" and "[[Little Miss Muffet]]" are alluded to in connection with the ladybird and the spider respectively.

Mrs. Tittlemouse's '''party guests''' are three gentlemen wood-mice and two gentlewomen wood-mice who are humanized and wear clothing like their hostess.  They are nameless, have no dialogue, and appear only in the illustrations at the end of the tale dancing in her parlour and drinking honeydew from acorn cups.

== Illustrations ==
[[File:Mrs Tittlemouse and the beetle.jpg|thumb|Mrs. Tittlemouse clatters her dust-pan and brush at a beetle. The chief attraction of the book's illustrations are not the humanized central characters but the microscopic and meticulous detail Potter lavished on the insects.]]

Potter's source for the wildlife and the insect drawings in ''Mrs. Tittlemouse'' were those she had executed in her early adulthood, either directly from nature or by observing specimens in the collections of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].<ref>MacDonald, p. 119</ref>  The interest in the book's illustrations lies in the microscopic accuracy of the insects rather than in any human qualities exhibited by Mrs. Tittlemouse or Mr. Jackson.  Potter is uncharacteristically careless in the depiction of the insects however. They appear to be drawn for their own sake, or seem to be out of scale with the heroine, or to change scale without reason. The ladybird seems larger than Mrs. Tittlemouse, and the spider appears first larger than Mrs. Tittlemouse and then smaller than the mouse. The bees are sometimes out of scale with both the toad and the mouse. The nature artist and the fantasy artist in Potter are at odds: the mouse, the toad, and the insects share the same habitat but there seems no logical reason for the mouse and the toad to be humanized while the insects remain their natural selves. Logically, they should be humanized, too. While the toad is an invader like the insects, he does Mrs. Tittlemouse the service of ridding her house of the bees yet is inexplicably excluded from the party, an affront to the reader's sense of social right and wrong. It is possible Potter's carelessness in the details of ''Mrs. Tittlemouse'' can be attributed to a desire on her part to simply display her ability to draw from nature or to her interest in book production being supplanted by a growing interest in farming and local politics.<ref>Kutzer, pp. 123-4</ref>

== Critical commentary ==
[[File:Bold Bad Spider.jpg|thumb|The insects tapped Potter's keen observation, but have been criticized for appearing either too small or too large in scale. Potter may have wished to produce a sense of horror and disgust with insects for the reader.]]

''Mrs Tittlemouse'' is a book in which no humans play a part and one in which events are treated as though they have occurred since time immemorial and far from human observance. It is a simple story and one likely to appeal to young children.<ref>Taylor, p. 143</ref>  The book tapped Potter's keen observation of various insects and amphibians, and her youthful experience drawing them.  Their depictions reflect Potter's microscopic understanding of insect anatomy, colouration, and behaviour; they are depicted in text and illustration with accuracy, humour, and true to their individual natures &ndash; she knew that toads only seek water during the spawning season, for example, and that they can smell out honey.  The spider and the butterfly are very much like those she drew from microscopic studies in the 1890s.<ref>Lear, pp. 234-5</ref>

The humanization of mice and stories about mice such as ''[[The Tailor of Gloucester]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Two Bad Mice]]'' came easily to Potter. Unlike Potter's urban house mouse characters however, Mrs. Tittlemouse is a country mouse living in a hedge somewhere near Potter's [[Sawrey]]. Her house is similar to Potter's cottage at [[Hill Top]] with its narrow passages, small rooms, low ceilings, and well-stocked storerooms.  Potter's obvious approval of Mrs. Tittlemouse's fastidious housekeeping has its source in her own pleasure in keeping [[Hill Top]] cottage tidy and demonstrate her pleasure (like Mrs. Tittlemouse's) in being the mistress of her domain.  Mrs. Tittlemouse's horror with insect intruders reflects Potter's own abhorrence of pests in her home but she nevertheless preserves their beauty in the book's illustrations. She doesn't censor their antennae, their groping limbs, or other grotesqueries.  Potter thought girls would like the story best and the insects such as the woodlice and the spider would produce in her audience exactly the effect she consciously or unconsciously wished to achieve &ndash; namely, complete disgust with insect pests.<ref>MacDonald, pp. 118-20</ref>

== Adaptations ==
In 1992, ''Mrs. Tittlemouse'' and ''[[The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies]]'' were integrated into a single animated episode and telecast on the [[BBC]] series, ''[[The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends]]''.
