'''Palisade Avenue''' is the name given to a historic road which parallels the eastern crest of [[Hudson Palisades]] in [[Gateway Region|northeastern New Jersey]]. It travels between in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] and [[Fort Lee, New Jersey|Fort Lee]], passing through [[Jersey City Heights]], [[North Hudson, New Jersey|North Hudson]], and [[Cliffside Park, New Jersey|Cliffside Park]], various parts carrying [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson]] and [[Bergen County|Bergen]] county route designations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/sldiag/09000685__-.pdf|format=PDF|title=Hudson County 685 straight line diagram|publisher=[[New Jersey Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=2010-01-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/sldiag/09000719__-.pdf|format=PDF|title=Hudson County 719 straight line diagram|publisher=[[New Jersey Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=2010-01-14}}</ref><ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/sldiag/02000027__-.pdf Bergen County Road 27] [[Straight Line Diagram]] from the [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]]</ref><ref name="sld">{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/sldiag/00000067__-.pdf|title=Route 67 straight line diagram|location=[[Trenton, New Jersey]]|publisher=[[New Jersey Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=November 13, 2009}}</ref>The avenue re-aligns itself at at several places along its route as it crosses traditional municipal boundaries created in the 19th century. As the primary route running along the top of the [[Hudson Palisades]], many segments offer scenic views of the [[Hudson River]] and the [[New York Skyline|New York skyline]].

The southern end of Palisade Avenue begins at [[Newark Plank Road|Newark Avenue]], just east of the [[Hudson County Courthouse]]. Running between the historic [[Jersey City High School]] and the 1942 Hudson Gardens Housing project<ref>[http://www.jcha.us/hudson_gardens.htm Hudson Gardens]</ref>, it crosses over [[Bergen Arches]] and [[Long Dock Tunnel]], both which served the [[Erie Railroad]]'s [[Pavonia Terminal]] and [[New Jersey Route 139|Divided Highway]] (connecting the [[Pulaski Skyway]] and the [[Holland Tunnel]]). At this point, the avenue enters [[Jersey City Heights]] and passes Christ Hospital.

Upon crossing a steep natural [[Ravine|ravine]] over a road traveling down the hill to [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], Palisade Avenue intersects with Ferry Street, the location where the [[North Hudson County Railway]]'s Wagon Lift and Elevated (the latter used by the [[Public Service Railway]] and dismantled in 1947) transported Heights residents to the top of the cliffs. Two office buildings, one formerly [[Public Service Electric and Gas Company|PSE&G]], and another now used North Hudson Commuity Action Group  <ref>[http://www.nhcac.org/nhcacsites.html North Hudson Community Action Group]</ref> are at the intersection of Ferry Street<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=Be5fjmQXCEcC&pg=PA59#v=onepage&q=&f=false</ref> (named for the connection possible) at the end of which is [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Hudson County, New Jersey|Pohlmann's Hall]].

Proceeding north the avenue creates the border for Riverview Park and the top of Holland Street (one of the few cobbled streets left in Hudson County) connecting to [[Paterson Plank Road]]. At 524, a farmhouse built in 1742 by the family [[Van Vorst Park|Van Vorst]] is considered to be the 2nd oldest building in [[Hudson County]].<ref>[http://www.cityofjerseycity.org/vanvorstfarmhouse.shtml Van Vorst House in Bergen Woods]</ref> is located. At Congress Street the [[9th Street-Congress Street (HBLR station)|9th Street-Congress Street Station]] which serves the [[Hudson Bergen Light Rail]] is one block to the east.

[[Paterson Plank Road]], which crosses Washington Park represents a line dividing Jersey City from [[Union City, New Jersey|Union City]], the southern part of which was at one time called [[West Hoboken, New Jersey|West Hoboken]]. A [[Yardley Soap]] factory recalls the city's manufacturing past.<ref>[http://www.wikimapia.org/#lat=40.754834&lon=-74.0365353&z=19&l=0&m=b&search=palisades%20avenue%2C%20%20jersey%20city Wikimapia:Yardley soap Building]</ref> [[Union City, New Jersey#Landmarks|Firefighters Memorial Park]].<ref>Rappaport, Melissa. "Now open: Firefighters Memorial Park" ''The Union City Reporter''; August 16, 2009; Pages 1 & 8</ref> was built partially as memorial to [[9/11]].

As the route passes the [[Hackensack Water Company Complex|Hackensack Water Company Reservoir #2]] it becomes a border between Union City and [[Weehawken, New Jersey|Weehawken Heights]], until it reaches [[New Jersey Route 495|Lincoln Tunnel Approach]], [[cut (earthmoving)|cut]] built in conjunction with the [[Lincoln Tunnel|tunnel]]. The Main Post Office at the intersection with 495 is a major stop for east-bound bus travel to [[Manhattan]]. 

After crossing over the highway and [[Hackensack Plank Road]] and entering the northern part of Union City formerly known as [[Union Hill, New Jersey|Union Hill]], the avenue becomes a one lane, one-way street traveling southbound. [[Union City, New Jersey|Union City City Hall]] is located on Palisade between 37th and 38th Streets.
Just south of the border at [[West New York, New Jersey|West New York]] the avenue makes an [[S curve]] and continues as a one-way southbound street through the municipality. In this segment the route approaches the highest point in [[Hudson County, New Jersey]] at 260 feet.<ref>[http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=7139 Hudson High Point]</ref>

In [[Gutenberg, New Jersey|Gutenburg]] the avenue once again realigns and becomes a two-way street which continues through the [[Woodcliff, North Bergen|Woodcliff Section]] of [[North Bergen, New Jersey|North Bergen]] where it meets [[North Hudson, New Jersey|North Hudson]]-[[James J. Braddock]] Park. The avenue resumes inside the park at [[Boulevard East]] traveling a short distance before crossing the Hudson-Bergen light rail line tunnel cut, then entering [[Cliffside Park, New Jersey|Cliffside Park]]. Taking a more meandering course the route passes the Cliffside Park Municipal Complex<ref>[http://www.cliffsideparknj.gov/Departments/MunicipalCourt.html Cliffside Park]</ref>, Cliffside Park Public Library<ref>[http://cliffsidepark.bccls.org/ Cliffside Park Public Library]</ref> and [[Cliffside Park High School]], then intersects with [[New Jersey Route 5|Gorge Road]], one of the few roads which travel downward along the face of the [[Hudson Palisades]] to the [[Hudson River]] in [[Edgewater, New Jersey|Edgewater]]. 

At the northern end of the borough the avenue passes the former site of [[Palisades Amusement Park]], demolished in the 1970s for the construction of high-rise residential complexes.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Palisades Park Expected To Close After Season |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00F15FE3D5F107B93C2AB178AD85F458785F9 |quote=Palisades Amusement Park, one of the last of the playgrounds that once dotted the outer reaches of the city and the nearby suburbs, may close after the 1971 season. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=January 20, 1971 |accessdate=2009-01-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Carousel, Anyone?
