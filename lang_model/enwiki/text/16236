'''''Strombus canarium''''', [[common name]] the '''dog conch''', is a [[species]] of medium-sized sea [[snail]], a [[marine (ocean)|marine]] [[gastropod]] [[mollusk]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Strombidae]], the true [[conch]]s. It is considered an [[economy|economically]] important species in the [[Indo-West Pacific]], and may be currently suffering [[population]] declines due to [[overfishing]] and [[overexploitation]].<ref name="Cob">Cob, Z.

This sea snail is lives in mud and sandy bottoms, grazing on [[algae]] and [[detritus]]. The shell of adult individuals is colored light yellowish brown or golden to grey. It has a characteristic inflated [[body whorl]], a flared and thick [[gastropod shell|outer lip]], and a shallow [[stromboid notch]]. Although it is considered a valuable ornamentation, the shell is often utilized as sinker for fishing nets. The anatomy of this species is similar to other [[strombidae|strombid]] snails, with a elongate [[snout]], thin [[eyestalk]]s containing well developed eyes and sensory tentacles, and a narrow, strong foot with a sickle-shaped [[operculum (gastropod)|operculum]] attached.

== Etymology ==

The [[specific name]] ''canarium'' is a derivative of the [[Latin]] word ''cani'' or ''can'', which means [[dog]].

== Shell description ==

''Strombus canarium'' has a very heavy shell, with a rounded outline. The maximum shell length of this species is up to 100&nbsp;mm, commonly to 65&nbsp;mm.<ref name="Poutiers">Poutiers, J. M. (1998). [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/w7191e/w7191e40.pdf '''Gastropods''' in: ''FAO Species Identification Guide for Fishery Purposes: The living marine resources of the Western Central Pacific Volume 1.'' Seaweeds, corals, bivalves and gastropods]. Rome, FAO. page 471.</ref> The outer surface of the shell is almost completely smooth, and unlike many species pertaining to the ''[[Strombus]]'' genus, its [[stromboid notch]] is rather inconspicuous, even difficult to distinguish. Assuming the shell is viewed ventrally, with its anterior end pointing downwards, the stromboid notch is visible as a shallow secondary anterior indentation in the [[Gastropod shell#Morphology|outer lip]], to the right of the [[siphonal canal]] in an adult [[Gastropod shell#Chirality in gastropods|dextral]] specimen.  The siphonal canal itself is straight, short and ample, and the [[columella]] is smooth, and completely devoid of [[plait (gastropod)|folds]].<ref name="Poutiers" /> Adult specimens present a moderately flared outer lip<ref name="Jawa"/>, considerably thickened and completely devoid of marginal spikes or [[Aperture (mollusc)#Terminology|plicae]]. The [[body whorl]] is roundly swollen at the shoulder, with a few anterior spiral grooves. It has a medium to high conoidal [[spire]], with at least five<ref name="Cob4">Cob, Z. C. ''et al.''(2009).[http://pkukmweb.ukm.my/~jsm/pdf_files/SM-PDF-38-1-2009/05%20Zaidi.pdf "Species Description and Distribution of ''Strombus'' (Mollusca: Strombidae) in Johor Straits and its Surrounding Areas".]''Sains Malaysiana'' 38(1): 39<U+2013>46.</ref> delicate furrowed and varicate [[whorl]]s.

The shell color is highly variable, from light yellowish brown or golden to grey. It is rarely dark, frequently paler or totally white ventrally, yet the [[aperture]] is always white. Mature specimens may present a metallic grey or golden brown gloss on the outer lip's margin and callus.<ref name="Poutiers" /> A zig-zag network of darker brown lines may be observed, but it is considered to be uncommon.<ref name="Cob4"/>
This species [[periostracum]], an organic coating covering the shell's surface, is yellowish brown in color, and usually thick and reticulated, with fimbriated sutures.<ref name="Cob4"/> The [[corneous]] [[Operculum (gastropod)|operculum]] has a dark brown color and a slightly bent [[Strombidae|stromboid]] [[sickle]] shape, presenting seven to eight weak lateral serrations.<ref name="Cob4"/>

Drawings from ''Index Testarum Conchyliorum'' (published in 1742 by the Italian [[physician]] and [[malacologist]] [[Niccol<U+00F2> Gualtieri]]) and photographs depict the morphology of dog conch shells, in both subadult and juvenile stages, from different perspectives.

== Anatomy ==

Like many other [[Strombidae]] (such as ''[[Lambis chiragra]]''), the [[female]] individuals of ''S. canarium'' are generally larger than [[male]] ones.<ref name="cob7">Cob, Z. C; Arshad, A; Bujang, J. S; Ghaffar, M. A. (2009).[http://scialert.net/fulltext/?doi=jas.2009.3287.3297 "Age, Growth, Mortality and Population Structure of ''Strombus canarium'' (Gastropoda: Strombidae): Variations in Male and Female Sub-Populations".] ''Journal of Applied Sciences'' 9 (18), 3287-3297.</ref> It's overall external anatomy is very similar to other [[Strombidae|Strombid]] snails; It possesses a long snout and thin [[eyestalk]]s containing well developed eyes and smaller sensory tentacles. Its foot is narrow and strong, and allows it to execute the leaping motion which other species of [[Strombidae]] also perform.<ref name="Jawa"/>

== Distribution ==

''Strombus canarium'' is native to the coastal waters of the [[Indo-Pacific]] region.<ref name="Cob">Cob, Z. C. ''et al. '' (2008).[http://www.insinet.net/rjfh/2008/71-77.pdf "Growth, Mortality, Recruitment and Yield-per-recruit of ''Strombus canarium'' Linnaeus, 1758 (Mesogastropoda: Strombidae) from the West Johor Straits, Malaysia".] ''Research Journal of Fisheries and Hydrobiology'' 3(2): 71-77. INSInet Publication.</ref> It occurs in the Indo-Pacific from [[India]] and [[Sri-Lanka]] to [[Melanesia]], and also in southern [[Japan]] and northern [[Australia]].<ref name="Poutiers"/>

==Behavior==

''Strombus canarium'' has a rather unusual mean of locomotion, which is common only among other [[Strombidae]], such as the queen conch ''[[Eustrombus gigas]]''. This curious series of maneuvers was first described by the American zoologist George Howard Parker (1864-1955)<ref name="2400YoM">{{cite book|last=Coan|first=E. V.|coauthors=Kabat, A. R.; Petit, R.

The animal first fixes the posterior end of the foot by having the point of the sickle-shaped operculum thrust into the substrate. Then it extends of the foot anteriorly, further lifting and throwing of the shell forward in a so called leaping motion.<ref name="Jawa"/><ref name="parker">{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=G. H.|year=1922|title=The leaping of the stromb (''Strombus gigas'' Linn.)|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|volume=36|pages=205<U+2013>209}}</ref>

== Ecology ==
=== Habitat ===

This sea snail dwells on muddy sand and algae bottoms of [[island|insular]] and continental [[shores]].<ref name="Poutiers"/> It can be found both in [[littoral]] and [[sublittoral]] zones, from shallow waters to 55 m depths.<ref name="Poutiers"/> ''S. canarium'' is normally found in large [[colony (biology)|colonies]]<ref name="Cob3">Cob, Z. C. ''et al. '' (2009).[http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/48.1/1.pdf "Development and Growth of Larvae of the Dog Conch, ''Strombus canarium'' (Mollusca: Gastropoda), in the Laboratory".] ''Zoological Studies'' 48(1): 1-11</ref>, and is usually abundant wherever it occurs.<ref name="Cob2">Cob, Z. C. ''et al. '' (2008).[http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/47.3/318.pdf "Sexual Polymorphism in a Population of ''Strombus canarium'' Linnaeus, 1758 (Mollusca: Gastropoda) at Merambong Shoal, Malaysia".] Zoological Studies 47(3): 318-325</ref>

=== Life cycle ===

''Strombus canarium'' is [[dioecious]]<ref name="Cob2"/>, which means  each individual organism belonging to this species is distinctly male or female. Its breeding season starts in late November, and continues until early March.<ref name="Cob6">Cob, Z. C. ''et al.'' (2008).[http://www.scialert.net/pdfs/jbs/2008/616-621.pdf "Sexual Maturity and Sex Determination in ''Strombus canarium'' Linnaeus, 1758 (Gastropoda: Strombidae)".] ''Journal of Biological Sciences'' 8(3): 616-621.</ref> After [[internal fertilization]], the female of ''S. canarium'' produces and [[Spawn (biology)|spawns]] a long gelatinous tubular structure containing multiple [[egg (biology)|egg]]s. It then coils itself and compacts to form an egg mass, and each one of them may contain about 50-70 thousand eggs.<ref name="Cob3"/> In approximately 110-130 hours, the [[embryo]] of ''S. canarium'' grows from a single [[Cell (biology)|cell]] to a [[veliger]], a larval form common to various marine and fresh-water gastropod and [[bivalve]] mollusks<ref name="Brusca&Brusca">{{cite book|last=Brusca|first=R. C.|coauthors=Brusca, G. J.|title=Invertebrates|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc.|date=2003|edition=2nd|pages=936|isbn=0878930973}}</ref>,  and then [[egg (biology)|hatches]]. The hatching process requires 12<U+2013>15 hours to occur.<ref name="Cob3"/> After hatching, ''S. canarium'' [[larvae]] can be assigned to 4 distinct developmental stages throughout their short [[planktonic]] life, based on morphological features and other proeminent characters. Larvae with 0<U+2013>3 days of age are Stage I veligers; 4-8 day old larvae are Stage II; 9-16 day old larvae are Stage III, and 17 day old until [[metamorphosis]] are Stage IV.<ref name="Cob3"/> The [[metamorphosis]] in ''S. canarium'' can be recognized by the loss of the larval [[veliger#Veliger of gastropods|velar lobes]], and also by the typical propodium crawling movement of [[juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] [[conch]]s.<ref name="Cob3"/>

Recent studies indicate that [[sexual dimorphism]]s occur very early during this species [[ontogeny]]. Additionally, ''S. canarium'' males reach their [[sexual maturity]] at a lower shell length compared to females.<ref name="Cob6"/> Individuals are usually considered to be [[adult]] by the time the [[gastropod shell|outer lip]] of their shell is notably thickened and flared.<ref name="Cob6"/>

=== Feeding habits ===

As is the case in other [[Strombidae]], ''Strombus canarium'' is known to be an [[herbivore]]<ref name="Cob2"/>, feeding on [[algae]], and also occasionally on [[detritus]]<ref name="Jawa">{{cite web|url=http://www.wildsingapore.com/wildfacts/mollusca/gastropoda/strombidae/canarium.htm|title=Online guide to Check Jawa: Gong-gong|accessdate=2009-11-03}}</ref>.

=== Interactions ===

Many [[carnivorous]] marine gastropod snails are known [[predator]]s of ''S. canarium'', such as the [[volutidae|volutes]] ''[[Cymbiola nobilis]]'' and ''[[Melo melo]]''<ref name="cob7"/>, and the cone snail ''[[Conus textile]]''.<ref name="AB1966">{{cite journal|last=Kohn|first=A.

== Human uses ==

The flesh of ''Strombus canarium'' is edible. It constitutes an important food staple for locals living along the seashore, and is fished in many parts of [[South East Asia]].<ref name="Cob"/>  The meat of ''S. canarium'' may be used in a wide variety of common recipes, such as [[soup]]s, cutlets, [[noodles]], [[curry]], and [[chilli]].<ref name="FoodJournal">{{cite journal|last=Arularasan|first=S.|coauthors=''et al''|year=2010|title=Recieps for the Mesogastropod - ''Strombus canarium''|journal=Advance Journal of Food Science and Technology|publisher=Maxwell Scientific Organization|volume=2|issue=1|pages=31<U+2013>35|issn=2042-4876|url=http://maxwellsci.com/print/ajfst/v2-31-35.pdf}}</ref>

== Conservation ==

Studies indicate that ''S. canarium'' has been [[overexploited]] and [[overfished]] recently in many areas, and specialists have recommended the reduction of exploitation rates as to maintain the availability of this resource.<ref name="Cob"/><ref name="cob7"/> ''Strombus canarium'' is now considered rare in [[Singapore]], probably as a result of unsustainable exploitation.<ref name="Jawa"/>
