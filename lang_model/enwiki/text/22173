'''Hague''' is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|town]] in northeastern [[Warren County, New York|Warren County]], [[New York]], [[United States]] located on the scenic [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]]. It is part of the [[Glens Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Metropolitan Areas and Components, 1999, with FIPS Codes |url= http://www.census.gov/population/estimates/metro-city/99mfips.txt |accessdate= July 7, 2009 |publisher= US Census Bureau}}</ref> The population was 854 at the 2000 census.{{GR|2}} The town was named after the city [[Hague]] in [[Holland]].

== History ==
In 1757, during the [[French and Indian War]],  [[Sabbath Day Point]] was used as an encampment and staging area for the French Army and nearly two thousand Ottawa Indians in an expedition to capture the British Fort William Henry at the southern end of Lake George.     While at the Sabbath Day Point camp, they conducted an ambush of a group of British soldiers and captured many.   Later at the Sabbath Day Point base camp, the Indians cannibilized some of the captured British  prisoners.

Sabbath Day Point was used a landing place in 1758 for [[Great Britain|British]] armies en route to attack the [[France|French]] at Fort Carillion and again in 1759 when General Jeffery Amherst finally succeeded in capturing Fort Carillon.  It was then renamed Fort Ticonderoga.

During the American Revolution, Benjamin Franklin twice encamped there traveling to and from Canada as an emissary of the Continental Congress in an unsuccessful attempt to have Canada join the Colonies in the revolution.  He was Postmaster General and in this capacity, he conducted temporary postal processing functions on each of his stays at Sabbath Day Point.

The town was first settled around 1796.
The Town of Hague was originally part of the [[Bolton, New York|Town of Bolton]] and was created in 1807 as the Town of Rochester.  In 1808 it changed its name to Hague.<ref name="smith">[http://www.rootsweb.com/~nywarren/countyhistory/smith/xxxi.htm History of Warren County, edited by H. P. Smith - Chapter XXXI: History of the Town of Hague]</ref>

In 1904 the waters of Hague bay were home of the [[Lake George Monster]].<ref name=csicop>{{cite web |title=The Lake George Monster Hoax |author=Nickell, Joe |work=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |month=December | year=2007 |url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/2004-12/i-files.html }}</ref><ref name=holg>{{cite web |title=Lake George Monster |work=Hague on Lake George Chamber of Commerce |url=http://www.visithague.com/monster.htm }}</ref>  The "monster" was the creation of Harry Watrous, and was part of a practical joke.<ref name=csicop/><ref name=holg/>

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|79.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|64.0|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|15.6|sqmi|km2}} of it (19.58%) is water.

[[New York State Route 8]] ends at [[U.S. Highway 9|NYS Route 9N]], which joins the lakeside communities on the east side of the town.

The east town line is the border of [[Washington County, New York|Washington County]], [[New York]].  The town and county include the surface of [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] so that only the opposite shore is part of Washington County.  The north town line is the border of [[Essex County, New York|Essex County]], [[New York]].

==Hague Central School==
The Town of Hague had its own centralized school district from 1927 to 1979. The former Hague Central School, razed in 1985, stood on the site of the current Hague Community Building, and was constructed in two sections in 1927 and 1930. The centralization of the school districts in Hague came nearly a decade before other towns in the region centralized their schools.

Throughout the 1970s, a bitter battle raged between seasonal and year-round residents over the viability of the school, with a student population of about 200 in grades K-12. Several annexation votes were held between 1971 and 1979. Many argued that consolidation with the Ticonderoga Central School District to the north would reduce taxes in the Town. Ironically, three decades after consolidation, the same segment of seasonal residents that originally pushed for consolidation now are protesting that Hague is taxed disportionately.

Through the last decades of its existence, Hague athletic teams were known as the Raiders, using various depicitions of Indians as their mascot. Originally sporting red and gray colors, those team colors had morphed into red and white by the 1970s.

Hague competed in the old Marcy League, which included teams from Bolton Landing, Chestertown, Horicon, Pottersville, Keene Valley, Indian Lake, Minerva, Newcomb, Long Lake, and Wells. Hague competed in soccer, basketball, and baseball.

In 1977-78 and again in 1978-79, Hague's basketball team advanced in the post-season beyond the sectionals. Competing in Section VII as a Class D school, the Hague Raiders won the Section VII title both years, advancing to the State Semi-Finals in 1978. In 1979 the Raiders advanced to the Capital District Semi-Finals.
