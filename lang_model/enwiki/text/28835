'''''Dommoc''''', a place not certainly identified but probably within the modern county of [[Suffolk]], was the original seat of the bishops of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Kingdom of East Anglia]]. It was established by King [[Sigeberht of East Anglia]] for Saint [[Felix of Burgundy]] in c. 629&ndash;31<ref>Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History'', Book II, Ch.15 (''accepitque sedem episcopatus in ciuitate Dommoc''), who stipulates Felix's mission in relation to Sigeberht's rule. The date is calculated as shown in ''Early Chronology'' below.</ref> It remained the bishopric of all East Anglia until c. 673, when [[Theodore of Tarsus]], Archbishop of Canterbury, divided the see and created a second bishopric at [[Helmham]] ([[North Elmham]], Norfolk, or [[South Elmham]], Suffolk). The see of ''Dommoc'' continued to exist until the time of the Viking Wars of the 860s, after which it lapsed.

== Foundation ==
The primary authority for the foundation of the see of ''Dommoc'' is [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Historia ecclesiastica]]'', ii.15. Following the assassination of King [[Eorpwald of East Anglia]] by [[Ricberht of East Anglia|Ricberht]] in c 627 the kingdom fell back into 'error' for three years, before Sigeberht, brother or half-brother of Eorpwald, took possession of the kingdom. Sigeberht had lived in exile in [[Gaul]] during his brother's lifetime, and had been initiated in the sacraments of the Faith, becoming a very Christian and very learned man. On his accession he resolved to ensure that the whole kingdom shared his faith, and he was very ably supported by Saint Felix. Felix had been born and consecrated in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. He came to Archbishop Honorius of Canterbury ([[Saint Honorius]]), and unfolded to him his desire to preach the Gospel of Life. Honorius sent him to the East Angles, where he found a fruitful multitude of believers, and brought that whole province to the faith and works of righteousness. He accepted the episcopal seat in the city (civitas) of ''Dommoc'', and when he had governed it for seventeen years he died there in peace. An alternative account surviving in the much later work of [[William of Malmesbury]] relates that Sigeberht and Felix came to the kingdom together from Gaul.

== Early chronology ==
The date of the foundation of ''Dommoc'' is estimated from the foregoing events, and from the duration of tenure of the first three bishops. [[Edwin of Northumbria]] was baptised by [[Paulinus of York]] at Easter 626, and they then undertook the conversion of [[Lindsey]] and of Eorpwald and his kingdom. Eorpwald was slain soon after his baptism, after which there was a reversal of faith for three years. Felix was bishop for seventeen years, his successor Thomas for five, and his successor [[Berhtgisl Boniface]] for a further seventeen (a total of 39 episcopal years). Both Thomas and Berhtgisl were consecrated by Archbishop Honorius, who died in 653 (Historia Ecclesiastica iii.20). After Berhtgisl's death Archbishop Theodore, who reached [[Canterbury]] in 668-9, appointed [[Bisi]] to ''Dommoc'', and Bisi attended the [[Council of Hertford]] in 673. By then Bisi's health was declining so that he was unable to administer the diocese, and soon afterwards Theodore divided the see (Historia Ecclesiastica, iv.5). Since Berhtgisl cannot have died later than 670 the foundation of ''Dommoc'' should date to c630-31, and the assassination of Eorpwald to c 627. This would place the death of Felix c647 and of Thomas c 652. That would accord with the ''Liber Eliensis'' tradition that Felix baptized Saint [[<U+00C6>thelthryth|Etheldreda]] in or soon after 631 at [[Exning]], and with William of Malmesbury's statement that he baptized [[Cenwalh of Wessex]] in East Anglia before that king was restored to Wessex by [[King Anna]] in c647.

== Location ==
Despite its former importance, the original location of ''Dommoc'' has been lost for many centuries and forms the subject of scholarly debate. This reflects rival claims staked during the 13th century by the monks of [[Eye]], Suffolk, (for [[Dunwich]], Suffolk) and of [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] in Kent (for [[Walton, Suffolk]]) . The uncertainty therefore arose between the tenth and twelfth centuries. [[William Camden]], in his ''Britannia'', promoted general acceptance of the identification with Dunwich, formerly a splendid city on the Suffolk coast between [[Aldeburgh]] and [[Southwold]], all but a tiny part of which has now been swept out to sea. The Rochester claim for Walton refers to the place near or in [[Felixstowe]], Suffolk, at the tip of the [[Colneis]] peninsula between the [[River Deben]] and the [[River Orwell]]. This Walton is not to be confused with [[Walton-on-the-Naze]], Essex, which stands on the south side of the Orwell and [[Stour]] estuary mouth, and which has never been seriously considered as a candidate for ''Dommoc''. The scholarly revival of the claim for Walton as ''Dommoc'' was the work of Stuart Rigold.

Bede records that Sigeberht ruled East Anglia together with [[Egric of East Anglia|Ecgric]], his relative or ''cognatus'', who until Sigeberht's abdication had ruled over part of the Kingdom, and afterwards succeeded to the rule of all of it. The meaning of the arrangement is not clear, but there is no difficulty in accepting that during his own reign Sigeberht had the power to grant a coastal site to Felix either at Dunwich or Felixstowe, since it was he who granted the shore fort at Cnobheresburg to [[Saint Fursey]] (Historia Ecclesiastica, iii.17-18).

Bede's use of the term ''civitas'' for ''Dommoc'', (which is also occasionally called ''Domnoc'' or ''Dommoc-ceastre''), suggests that the site had once been a Roman settlement, possibly fortified. The re-use of [[Roman fort]]s or fortified enclosures for early Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical and monastic purposes is well-attested, for instance at ''Othona'' ([[Bradwell-on-Sea]], [[Essex]]), [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] and [[Reculver]] ([[Kent]]), ''Durobrivae'' ([[Castor, Cambridgeshire]]), and in East Anglia at Fursey's monastery (probably [[Burgh Castle]] or [[Gariannonum]]). It is certain that there was a stone fort at Walton, like other shore-forts of about {{convert|6|acre|m2}} enclosure, and that it was adjacent to a large Roman settlement, most of which (including the fort) is now lost into the sea. The nature of Roman Dunwich is less well understood, for although some important [[Roman road]]s lead towards it, the site was lost to the sea too early for archaeological records. However it formerly had an important harbour which might have been protected by a fort. (Similarly Aldeburgh (which means 'old burgh' in Old English) may also have possessed a fort defending the Alde estuary.) The placename evidence is also indecisive.

G.E. Fox and C.E. Stevens suggested that the fort at Walton might be the ''Portus Adurni'' of the [[Notitia Dignitatum]], usually identified as [[Portchester]]. Be that as it may, the existence of additional forts not mentioned in the ''Notitia'' presents no difficulty since that is not a list of all fortresses, but of military units and their stations under the command of the [[Count of the Saxon Shore]].

==Dunwich==
The similarity of sound between ''Dommoc'' and Dunwich may be misleading. ''Dommoc'' is a difficult name to construe, but could derive from the Latin ''dominicum'', a church, possibly in an Irish-assimilated form ''domnhac'', as Fletcher notes. The name ''Dunwich'' (in c 1200 ''Donewic'' or ''Donewiz'') should mean the ''wic'' (''market'', possibly from ''vicus'', often riverine or estuarine) at the hill. The important ''wic'' names of [[Ipswich]] and [[Norwich]] are comparable. If the name ''Dommoc'' became Dunwich, its original meaning was lost in the shift and a different etymological structure was adopted to explain and replace it, between the tenth and twelfth centuries.

There was no known church dedicated to Saint Felix at Dunwich, but that is no objection since the founder could not have commemorated himself and would likely have made an apostolic dedication. Dunwich was thriving at [[Domesday Book|Domesday]], but following sea encroachments many of its ecclesiastical possessions were granted to the rising Priory of Eye in north Suffolk. The seal-matrix of the last-known bishop of ''Dommoc'', Ethilwald, was discovered about two hundred years ago at Eye. Eye also possessed in post-mediaeval times a book now lost, known as the 'Red Book of Eye', written in [[Lombard language|Lombard]]ic [[majuscule]] and presumably with purple-stained pages, reputed to have belonged to Saint Felix. These may have reached Eye from Dunwich, but they might also have been taken to [[Hoxne]], close to Eye, during the tenth or eleventh centuries from any centre in East Anglia, when Hoxne was temporarily the episcopal seat.

During the fifteenth century, when the Dunwich identification had taken hold, a series of glass windows depicting Saint Fursey, Saint Felix, Saint Etheldreda, and other Anglo-Saxon subjects existed at [[Blythburgh]] church, not far from Dunwich. However that site had its own independent [[Wuffing]] tradition connected with the grave of King [[Anna of East Anglia]] (d. 653), but (conversely) its position at the fordable headwaters of the [[River Blyth, Suffolk|Blyth]] estuary, controlling the Blyth and its watershed hinterland suggests the likely existence of a royal dwelling in that neighbourhood in the time of Anna himself, and of Saint Felix. If so, the siting of an episcopal seat at Dunwich would be readily explicable.

==Felixstowe==
The apparent connection between Felixstowe and the name of Felix is suggestive, but the placename Felixstowe is not recorded before the thirteenth century and its origin is disputed. A Stow may be a holy site, but the Domesday name for the Walton fort is ''Burch'', a form of the word ''Burgh''. A priory dedicated to St Felix was founded within the fort at Walton around the end of the eleventh century by [[Roger Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk]], who invited monks from Rochester to establish themselves there. During the twelfth century the powerful Bigod family also had a castle at Walton and a separate large residence there (the Manor, or Old Hall), at which [[John of England|King John]] issued the [[Ipswich]] Town Charter in 1200.

The church site at nearby [[Falkenham]] (overlooking the river Deben between [[Hemley]] and Felixstowe Ferry) may have early Wuffing associations, for it is dedicated to the royal martyr [[Saint <U+00C6>thelberht]] (d.794). Falkenham was at Domesday a sub-manor or berewick of Walton, and in the time of Archbishop [[Lanfranc]] it was claimed by Rochester as one of a group of possessions which had been taken from it into royal keeping during the [[Viking]] Wars.

The situation of Walton fort, overlooking the seaward reaches of the Deben estuary towards the former island of [[Bawdsey]] on the north bank, was of prime importance to the control of that river and lay directly within the sphere of [[Rendlesham]], the Wuffinga royal dwelling known to have existed a little above the fordable headwaters of the Deben estuary in c 660. The [[Sutton Hoo]] cemetery demonstrates the outstanding importance of this river as a seat of regnal power shortly before Sigeberht's time, during the period of [[R<U+00E6>dwald]]'s reign, and as the centre of a regio or province spreading from the [[River Orwell|Orwell]] to beyond the [[River Alde]] and across the tributary hinterlands of the Alde and Deben rivers.

It is strongly inferred that St Paulinus, from the [[Canterbury]] mission, was present in East Anglia at R<U+00E6>dwald's court in around 616, and it seems likely that the dedication of Rendlesham church to Saint [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] belongs to the early phases of that mission into East Anglia. After his escape from [[York]] in 632-3, Paulinus became Bishop of Rochester until his death in c644, during the first decade of Felix's episcopacy of ''Dommoc''. Bede records that Felix obtained teachers from [[Kent]] to supply the school founded in East Anglia by Sigeberht. Rochester was then the closest bishopric to East Anglia by the sea-route to Kent from the Deben. It is therefore possible that when Roger Bigod founded a priory at Walton fort he was consciously renewing a connection between Rochester and Walton which had been developed in the time of Felix and Paulinus.

Rochester's claim is expressed thus: 'b. Felix fundavit eccl'iam q'e m'o Felixstowe uocatur et in ea sedit xvji annis' (''The blessed Felix founded the church which is now called Felixstowe and sate in that (place) 17 years''). It appears in the monastic register compiled before 1251 (Harleian MS 261), under the annal for 633. The 16th century [[antiquary]] [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] noted sources supporting both the claims of Eye for Dunwich and of Rochester for Walton. However it must be remembered that there are several East Anglian sites associated with the work of Saint Felix. Although one of these two seems most likely, there is no absolute certainty that it was either.
