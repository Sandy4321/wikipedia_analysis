Sanjeeb wrote a number of songs including <U+201C>Rani Ghumay<U+201D>, <U+201C>Chokkhu Khule Dekho<U+201D> and <U+201C>Hattimatimtim<U+201D> for Bappa<U+2019>s inaugural solo album. They worked together in the Aashok Karmokar photo exhibition '' 'Kalratri' '', which impressed the audiences and encouraged the duo to form a band. Sanjeeb proposed Bappa to form a musical group. Bappa agreed and Sanjeeb named the Band ''Dalchhut'' As a result, Dalchhut was formed in November 1996.<ref>{{cite news
