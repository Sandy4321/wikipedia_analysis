The '''Felsenau power plant''' ({{lang-de|Kraftwerk Felsenau}}) is a [[hydroelectric power plant]] located on the river [[Aar]] in [[Berne]], Switzerland. It was built in 1909 by the city's utility company, [[Energie Wasser Bern]]. After a 1989 modernisation, the turbine hall is now used as a museum. The plant's current power output is 11.5 [[megawatt]]s.

The main building was designed by [[Eduard Locher]] and [[Alfred Brunschwyler]] in a then-popular historicising style as a "palace of technology". The 1989 expansion is by [[Vladimir Grossen]] and [[Bea Baumann]].
