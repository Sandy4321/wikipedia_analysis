The '''British Baltic Fishery Protection Service''' (BBFPS) was a front organization of the British intelligence service [[MI6]]. It was founded in 1949 - ostensibly to monitor the fisheries within the maritime borders of the [[British occupation zone]] in the [[Baltic Sea]] as a part of the [[Royal Navy]], but in reality to carry out covert operations in the Baltic region.
