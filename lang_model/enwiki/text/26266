}}</ref> The episode originally aired August 28, 1995 on the [[UPN]] network. Directed by [[James L. Conway]], it was written by producers [[Jeri Taylor]] and [[Brannon Braga]]. It was originally intended to be a two part episode to bridge between the first and second seasons, but was subsequently re-written to be a single part. Due to late changes to the final act of the episode, special effects shots of the settler's cities could not be completed, which Braga and series creator [[Michael Piller]] were unhappy with.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the [[Starfleet]] and [[Maquis (Star Trek)|Maquis]] crew of the starship [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']] after they were stranded in the [[Delta Quadrant]] far from the rest of the [[Federation (Star Trek)|Federation]]. In this episode, ''Voyager''{{'}}s crew discovering a group of [[Human (Star Trek)|Human]]s<U+2014>including [[Amelia Earhart]] ([[Sharon Lawrence]])<U+2014>who were abducted from Earth in 1937.<ref name="STepisode" />

Sharon Lawrence was cast as Amelia Earhart, after she had previously worked with ''Voyager''{{'s}} casting director on ''[[NYPD Blue]]''.  The episode shows the first time that a Federation [[starship]] lands on a planet's surface. CGI was used to show the landing struts unfold, and feet were added to the ''Voyager'' model for filming; however the production crew weren't pleased with these and obscured them during filming. The episode received [[Nielsen Ratings]] of 7.5 percent, and was given a mixed response by critics. Amongst the criticisms were the density of the ideas in the episode and the gimmicky appearance of Earhart. But it was also said to be redeemed by the vignettes showing the crew discussing whether to leave the ship, and that the episode contained a "powerful feminist narrative".<ref name="GASIST"/>

==Plot==
On stardate 48975.1,<ref name="STepisode" /> the crew of {{USS|Voyager|Star Trek|2}} follow an ancient [[SOS]] to a [[Class L]] planet whose atmospheric interference requires landing the ship to investigate.  On the surface, [[Kathryn Janeway|Captain Janeway]] ([[Kate Mulgrew]]) leads an away team to discover the source of the transmission: a [[Lockheed Model 10 Electra]]<ref name="textcommentary" /> with an alien generator added to sustain the SOS.  Joining Commander [[Chakotay]]'s ([[Robert Beltran]]) team, the crew finds a "[[cryopreservation|cryostasis]] chamber" containing eight humans preserved since the 1930s, including [[Amelia Earhart]] ([[Sharon Lawrence]]) and her [[navigator]], [[Fred Noonan]] ([[David Graf]]).<ref name="VoyagerCompanion" />

After resuscitation, Noonan leads a rebellion and holds the ''Voyager'' officers hostage, disbelieving their story and insisting to speak to [[J. Edgar Hoover]].  After Janeway speaks to Earhart and explains her significance to not only Human history, but her own life as well, the displaced Earhart disarms Noonan and leads some of them out of the caves.  Outside however, a firefight breaks out between the [[Starfleet]] officers and three hooded figures.  After [[Flanking maneuver|flanking]] the aliens, both they and Janeway are surprised to learn each is Human.

In 1937, over 300 Humans were abducted from Earth by the Briori, an alien species.  The Humans were brought as slaves to this planet in the [[Delta Quadrant]], but rose up against their slavers and took what was theirs.  Fifteen generations later, there are over 100,000 Humans living in three cities on the planet.  The last eight un-revived Humans in cryostasis were thought dead by their contemporaries and descendants who came to revere "the 37s" as "monuments to [their] ancestors".

After the settlers offer to accept any ''Voyager'' crew into their society, Janeway faces a crisis of conscience.  Can she decide, for all 152 people on ''Voyager'', to condemn them to the 70-year journey home to [[Earth]]; yet, if the choice is presented to the crew, the ship cannot be staffed by less than 100.  In the end, Janeway allows the crew to decide for themselves and none of them choose to leave.

"The 37's" was written by [[Jeri Taylor]] and [[Brannon Braga]].<ref name="CinefantastiqueEpisode" />  One of four season two episodes produced during season one (the others being "[[Projections (Star Trek: Voyager)|Projections]]", "[[Elogium]]", and "[[Twisted (Star Trek: Voyager)|Twisted]]"),<ref name="textcommentary">{{cite AV media

Both writers wanted to end the first season by showing the Starfleet and Maquis factions aboard the ship banding together as a crew, accepting their long journey home, and "whining less about home."<ref name="CinefantastiqueEpisode" /><ref name="supplemental" />  The landing of ''Voyager'' was also intended to take advantage of the last episode of the season as an opportunity to really wow the audience.<ref name="voyager5braga">{{cite journal

Braga wanted the episode to be broken into a [[story arc|two-part episode]] due to what he called "a wealth of material",<ref name="voyager5braga" /> what Kate Mulgrew would later describe as "every scene" containing a monologue.<ref name="voyager5mulgrew" />  However, because the episode was to end the first season, nobody else on the staff wanted to end the first season on a cliffhanger.  Condensing it into one episode, Braga admitted to struggling with the story, pointing out dramatically different tones in the first three acts as compared to the final two.  Ultimately though, he was satisfied with the end result and how the story came back around to focus on the ''Voyager'' crew in the end.<ref name="voyager5braga" />

The colonists' cities, which are described in the episode as "[something] to be proud of", "amazing", and impressive, were never actually seen in the episode.<ref name="itself" />  Jeri Taylor explained that the last act of the episode was developed very late, and between budgetary considerations and time constraints, they simply couldn't be realized.<ref name="Cinefantastique28">{{cite journal

The actress was excited to be portraying a version of Earhart, saying that she relishes the professional relationships roles like these have<U+2014>as opposed to ones featuring "domestic or familial relationship[s]."<ref name="textcommentary" />  In "The 37's", Lawrence was drawn to the relationship Earhart has with Janeway: two women, two processional pilots who've risen to great heights in their chosen fields.  Not only did the historical character appeal to her, but Lawrence also reveled in the "what-if" twist, the [[alternate history|alternate historical]] story about what happened.<ref name="voyager5lawrence" />

Lawrence grew up watching Mulgrew as Mary Ryan on the [[soap opera]] ''[[Ryan's Hope]]''.  As Lawrence came from a family where women more often than not became [[homemaker]]s, Mary Ryan was an "exotic" character<U+2014>with her career and life in [[New York City]]<U+2014>who served as inspiration.  On the set of ''Star Trek: Voyager'' the two actresses spoke frequently about their careers, their backgrounds in theater, and the struggles of balancing home and professional requirements.<ref name="voyager5lawrence" />  Lawrence felt that her relationship with Mulgrew influenced the relationship between their characters on screen.  Mulgrew would go on to praise Lawrence's performance in "The 37's", saying that "[she] really played the hell out of that role".<ref name="textcommentary" />

Though she specifically remarked on her pleasure at seeing Robert Beltran (Chakotay) again, Lawrence praised all the cast's professionalism and their ability to cope with the "vast amount of virtually unreferenced text that they have on ''Star Trek''.<ref name="voyager5lawrence" />

===Landing the USS ''Voyager''===

====Background====
For [[Star Trek: The Original Series|the original ''Star Trek'']], to avoid the tremendous costs of landing the {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701|2}} every week, [[Gene Roddenberry]] invented the transporter to get the crew to and from planets cheaply and quickly.<ref name="textcommentary" />  For ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' however, the concept of landing the ''Voyager'' was considered from the beginning as a way to differentiate the new series from those that preceded it.<ref name="AVOTF14">{{cite book

"The 37's" is the first time in [[Star Trek canon|''Star Trek'' canon]] that a [[starship]] is landed on a planet's surface.<ref name="VoyagerCompanion" /><ref name="textcommentary" />  This was accomplished with a combination of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) and [[physical model]]ing.

Scenes with the landed ship [[filming location|were shot in]] [[Bronson Canyon]].  Prior to filming, shots were plotted out with a [[styrofoam]], "foam-core ''Voyager'' mockup for scale and perspective."  Since the canyon couldn't provide enough space to show the entire landed ship, the ''Voyager'' set down with the fore of the ship visible outside the mouth of the canyon against a [[matte painting]] backdrop.  Visual effects supervisor [[Ronald B. Moore]] would later admit that the [[compositing|composited]] ''Voyager'' in the canyon was far too small with respect to the shooting location, though without any visible references for the audience, and by keeping the cast between the ship and camera, it wasn't obvious to anybody except the visual effects crew.<ref name="Communicator105" /><ref name="redalert" />

==Reception==
"The 37's" was first aired in the United States on UPN on August 28, 1995.

''[[Cinefantastique]]''{{'}}s Dale Kutzera felt that "The 37's" had too many disparate ideas crammed into one episode.
