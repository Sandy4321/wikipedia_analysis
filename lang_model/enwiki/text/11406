==2008 election and sexual abuse scandal==
In the 2008 election, Ellis was dropped from the Republican ticket because of an incident with former fiancee Lisa Whalen who filed a [[protection from abuse]] order against him.<ref name=report>{{Cite news | last = Neri| first = Al| authorlink = Albert J. Neri| title =  Special Report on Montco| newspaper = [[The Insider (newspaper)|The Insider]]| date = February 2007| url = http://www.insiderpa.com/archive/insider2-2007.htm}}</ref> As a result, Ellis was unable to secure the county GOP's endorsement for a second four-year term in 2007, resulting in a bitter split in the county GOP. Whalen subsequently withdrew that request. While Ellis denied physically abusing Whalen as she alleged in her petition, he did publicly apologize to her at a county commissioners meeting. Ellis unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the Republican nomination independent of the party apparatus, losing to [[Bruce Castor]] and Jim Matthews.<ref name=report />

==2010 Sexual Harassment Charges==
On April 13, 2010, Montgomery County Web editor Marina Bradley accused Ellis of threatening her job. Bradley, who had recently broke off her relationship with Ellis, alleged that Ellis made multiple phone calls to Bradley, including some to her county office, and sent multiple e-mails to her 

Two sources familiar with the complaint said Ellis threatened Bradley's job and that one e-mail warned her that "you do not want to be my enemy." Under an EOO agreement, Ellis is forbidden to have any contact with Bradley, who was hired in July 2007 when Ellis served as chairman of the county commissioners. 

Montgomery County commissioners were advised of the accusation in a closed-door meeting. Shortly afterwards, solicitor [[Barry M. Miller]] confirmed that Ellis violating the agreement restrictions and allegedly tried to contact Bradley again by phone when he learned the commissioners had been briefed. Ellis denies contacting Bradley. 

Asked to respond to the allegations in the complaint, Ellis responded by e-mail, stating, "Any comment would have to come from Bev Jackson as I can't violate Marina's confidentiality. Can tell you case was closed without consequence?" 

However, Ellis, releasing a letter Monday evening that he sent Saturday to county Chief Operating Officer Robert W. Graf, denies violating the agreement. The letter, in part, states: "As for Ms. Bradley and myself, that case was amicably closed April 1 and never violated by either party. As I told Ms. Jackson, I did mistakenly dial Ms. Bradley on her cell when trying to call someone with a very close number and I dialed too quickly...after four years, it was an old habit. Nothing was said and I immediately hung up when I realized my mistake. That happened one time in a month. I have said nothing to Ms. Bradley nor seen her in or out of the county workplace."<ref>[http://www.phillyburbs.com/news/local/courier_times/courier_times_news_details/article/28/2010/april/13/montco-worker-charges-harassment.html Montgomery County Worker Charges Ellis with Harassment]</ref><ref>[http://www.timesherald.com/articles/2010/04/15/news/doc4bc69cd34e7f2637605766.txt Montgomery County employee goes on record against treasurer]</ref>

When asked if he would call for the treasurer<U+2019>s resignation, Montgomery County commissioner [[Joe Hoeffel]] said he was still looking into the matter. "I<U+2019>m waiting to get more information from our staff,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m very troubled by it.<U+201D><ref>[http://www.thereporteronline.com/articles/2010/04/14/news/doc4bc59afd119ed325555268.txt Harassment complaint to air Thursday]</ref>
