"'''The Ex-Girlfriend'''" is the sixth episode of [[NBC]]'s [[sitcom]] ''[[Seinfeld]]'', and the first episode for the show's [[Seinfeld (season 2)|second season]]. It was first broadcast on NBC in the [[United States]] on January 23, 1991, after being postponed one week due to the commencement of the [[First Gulf War]]. In the episode, written by series co-creators [[Larry David]] and [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and directed by [[Tom Cherones]], [[George Costanza]] ([[Jason Alexander]]) breaks up with his girlfriend Marlene (Tracy Kolis). However, afterwards, he realizes he left some books in her apartment and convinces his friend [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry Seinfeld]] (Jerry Seinfeld), the show's [[protagonist]], to retrieve them. Jerry starts dating Marlene, but, after realizing that he finds her just as annoying as George did, finds himself unable to break up with her because she has a "psycho-sexual" hold on him.

The episode was inspired by one of David's personal experiences, and contained various cultural references. Starting with this episode, filming of the show took place on [[CBS Studio Center]] in [[Studio City, Los Angeles, California]], as opposed to [[Ren-Mar Studios|Desilu Cahuenga]] in [[Hollywood, California]], where the first season had been filmed. "The Ex-Girlfriend" featured one new set, a [[chiropractor]]'s office. The rest of the sets that appeared had been used on the show earlier. The episode gained a [[Nielsen Rating]] of 10.9/17 and was positively received by critics.

==Plot==
[[George Costanza|George]] decides he wants to break up with his girlfriend Marlene ([[Tracy Kolis]]), whom he finds extremely annoying because she leaves long messages on his answering machine and is always talking. After the emotional break-up, however, he realizes that he left some books in her apartment. [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry]] tries to convince George that he does not need the books because he has already read them, but George pursuades Jerry to get them for him. In order to retrieve the books, Jerry has to go on a date with Marlene, during which she tells him that, though she is no longer in a relationship with George, she and Jerry can still be friends. Jerry and Marlene start dating, but Jerry realizes that he finds her just as annoying as George did. He wants to break up with her but finds he is unable to because she has a "psycho-sexual hold" on him. 

Jerry finds it hard to tell George he his dating her, but after hearing a story from his ex-girlfriend [[Elaine Benes]] ([[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]]), who confronted a man that did not greet her on the street, Jerry decides to tell him. George has no problem with Jerry dating his ex-girlfriend. The following night, Jerry asks Marlene to come up to his apartment, but she tells him that it might be better not to date him anymore. Jerry asks her why, to which she replies that she did not think his stand-up comedy act was funny.

==Cultural references==
[[File:Tony Bennett LoC 2003.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A song by singer [[Tony Bennett]] is referenced in the episode.]]
The episode contained a small amount of references to [[pop culture]]. Elaine mentions that a man she knows used to nod at her whenever he saw him, but suddenly stopped, and she states "{{interp|...}} he went from nods to nothing." This prompts George to hum the [[Tony Bennet]] song "[[Rags to Riches (song)|Rags to Riches]]", replacing the chorus with "nods to nothing".<ref name="NAN"/> During a discussion with Elaine, Jerry mentions the 1958 film ''[[The Blob]]'', which starred [[Steve McQueen]].<ref name="NAN"/> Jerry also mentiones the novel ''[[Moby Dick]]'', jokingly stating that "when you read ''Moby Dick'' the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends".<ref name="NAN"/> After George receives a bill from his [[chiropractor]], he states "75 [[wiktionary:Buck|buck]]s? What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?" This is a reference to singer and actor [[Frank Sinatra]],<ref name="NAN">{{cite video|title=Seinfeld Seasons 1 & 2: Notes about Nothing - "The Ex-Girlfriend"|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]|date2=November 3, 2004}}</ref> who, coincidentally, died the same day the [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|last episode of ''Seinfeld'']] was aired on NBC.<ref name="NAN"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Sinatra and Seinfeld: Something and Nothing|author=Norman, Tony|date=May 19, 1998|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|page=G1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Sinatra's Death Muzzles Seinfeld Hype|author=Saunders, Dusty|date=May 18, 1998|work=[[The Rocky Mountain News]]}}</ref>

==Production==
The episode was written by series co-creators [[Larry David]] and [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and directed by [[Tom Cherones]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Lavery, David; Dunne, Sara Lewis|title=Seinfeld, master of its domain: revisiting television's greatest sitcom|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|year=2006|ISBN=9780826418036|page=232}}</ref> It was based on one of David's experiences, when he gave a ride home to a woman whom had recently dated a friend of his. On ''Seinfeld'', David would frequently come up with the idea for an episode and would make it into a teleplay with Seinfeld's help; in a 1991 interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Seinfeld stated: "Most of the stories are from [David's] life. He just has a tremendous wellspring of ideas. I mean, he just fills notebooks with ideas and I try to help him, but Larry is really the designer of the show."<ref name="NAN"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Tiny Issues, Big Laughs `Seinfeld' Earns Right to Weekly Berth to Toy With Life's Little Dilemmas|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=[[Los Angeles, California]]|author=Weinstein, Steve|date=September 4, 1991|page=F1}}</ref> A small amount of scenes in the episode were cut prior to broadcast; before George's break-up with Marlene, George has a discussion with Jerry in his car about breaking up with her. This scene originally featured George proposing to Jerry that he stage his own kidnapping while walking down the street with Marlene and hide out until she had given up on him. Though it was cut before the episode's broadcast, the scene was later included on the ''Seinfeld Volume 1'' [[DVD]] set. Another scene that was cut featured Jerry's neighbour [[Cosmo Kramer]] ([[Michael Richards]]) entering Jerry's apartment carrying a plate with [[cantaloupe]] on toothpicks.<ref name="NAN"/><ref>{{cite video|title=Seinfeld Seasons 1 & 2: Deleted Scenes - "The Ex-Girlfriend"|medium=DVD|publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|date2=November 3, 2004}}</ref> Originally, the scene in which Jerry tells George that he is dating Marlene took place in a library, with a librarian repeatably shushing George and Jerry and kicking them out of the library at the end of the scene. This was changed because Jerry and George's dialogue had nothing to do with a library.<ref name="NAN"/>

The first [[table read]] of the episode took place on October 17, 1990. It was filmed in front of a studio audience six days later, on October 23. Seinfeld's stand-up performances were filmed on October 29, 1990, along with the performances used in "[[The Pony Remark]]" and "[[The Busboy]]"; Seinfeld would change wardrobe between takes. Filming of the episode took place on stage 19 of the [[CBS Studio Center]] in [[Studio City, Los Angeles, California]].<ref name="NAN"/> "The Ex-Girlfriend" was the first episode to be filmed there, as the majority of season one was filmed in a studio called [[Ren-Mar Studios|Desilu Cahuenga]], in [[Hollywood, California]], where ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' had also been filmed.<ref>{{cite video|people=[[Rob Reiner|Reiner, Rob]]; Ludwin, Rick; [[Jerry Seinfeld|Seinfeld, Jerry]]; [[Larry David|David, Larry]]; [[Jason Alexander|Alexander, Jason]]|title=Seinfeld Seasons 1 & 2: Inside Looks - "The Seinfeld Chronicles"|medium=DVD|publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|date2=November 3, 2004}}</ref> [[Tom Azzari]] designed the sets for the second season of the show, including this episode. He was able to re-use various sets used in the [[Seinfeld (season 1)|first season]], because [[Castle Rock Entertainment]], which produced the show, had rented a large storage facility so the sets did not have to be rebuilt from scratch every week. The chiropractor's waiting room, in which George finds he was charged too much for a visit to the chiropractor, was the only new set that appeared in the episode.<ref name="NAN"/>

[[File:Restaurant.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Tom's Diner]], a real diner in New York, served as the exterior for [[Monk's Cafe]].]]
Though the scenes in [[Monk's Cafe]] were filmed at CBS Studio Center, the exterior of [[Tom's Diner]], a diner at [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]] and [[112th Street]] in [[Manhattan]], was used as the exterior for the cafe.<ref>{{cite news|title=Monk's Cafe Part of Museum's ''Seinfeld'' Exhibit|work=[[Hartford Courant]]|date=October 4, 1998|author=Stansbury, Robin|location=[[Hartford, Connecticut]]|page=F3}}</ref> The second scene of the episode, which takes place on a street, was filmed on CBS Studio Center's "New York Street", a set that consists of four very small store fronts. During seasons one to five, "New York Street" was the only set the writers could use to replicate [[New York City]]. This scene, and additional scenes that take place in Jerry's car, were filmed on October 22 from 5:00 to 8:30 [[Post meridiem|p.m]]. One or two members of the crew would shake the car to give the impression that it was moving, though it never actually was. Other crew members would move lights around the set to simulate street lights or headlights of other cars. Behind the car, two lights on a wheeled stand were placed to give the impression that there was a car behind it. This technique is called "Poor man's process", because it is cheaper than other ways of achieving the effect.<ref name="NAN"/> The show had previously experimented with this technique in the season one episode "[[The Stake Out]]".<ref>{{cite video|people=[[Jerry Seinfeld|Seinfed, Jerry]]; [[Larry David|David, Larry]]|title=Seinfeld Seasons 1 & 2: Audio Commentary for "The Stake Out"|medium=DVD|publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|}}</ref> 

Auditions were held for the part of Marlene; actresses who auditioned for the part included [[Amy Yasbeck]], [[Jeri Ryan]], who would go on to star in ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', and [[Heidi Swedberg]]. Swedberg was cast later as [[Susan Ross]] for ''Seinfeld''{{'}}s [[Seinfeld (season 4)|fourth season]]. Tracy Kolis, who at the time was known for her appearance in the [[soap opera]] ''[[All My Children]]'', was eventually cast for the part.<ref name="NAN"/> She reappeared later in the [[Seinfeld (season 6)|season six]] episode "[[The Soup]]", in which she portrayed a waitress named Kelly.<ref name="NAN"/><ref>{{cite news|title=It's about nothing, but I've learned a lot|author=[[Richard Roeper|Roeper, Richard]]|date=November 21, 2004|location=[[Chicago, Illinois]]|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|page=1}}</ref> Norman Brenner, who worked as Richards' [[stand-in]] on the show for all its nine seasons,<ref>{{cite video|title=Seinfeld Seasons 1 & 2: Notes about Nothing - "The Stake Out"|medium=DVD|publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment}}</ref> appears as an [[Extra (actor)|extra]]; he walks by twice, in different clothing, during the second scene of the episode.

==Reception==
"The Ex-Girlfriend" was first broadcasted on [[NBC]] on January 23, 1991, after being postponed one week due to the commencement of the [[First Gulf War]]. The episode gained a [[Nielsen Rating]] of 10.9 and an audience share of 17, meaning that 10.9% of American households watched the episode, and that 17% of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it. Although ''Seinfeld'' would be considered a hit show by todays standards, NBC was disappointed with its ratings, and, after three weeks, put the show on [[Recess (break)|hiatus]].<ref name="NAN"/> 

Critics reacted positively to the episode.<ref name="NAN"/> Joseph P. Kahn, a critic for the ''[[Wilmington Morning Star]]'', called the episode's writing and acting "anything but hackneyed" and stated "One safe prediction, ''Seinfeld'' will be here for a good long run this time around" (referring to how its first season only had five episodes).<ref>{{cite news|author=Kahn, Joseph|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5dEVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RBQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4789,232918&dq=seinfeld+tracy+kolis|work=[[Wilmington Morning Star]]|date=January 16, 1991|title=Seinfeld Sitcom has solid start|page=5B|accessdate=August 16, 2009}}</ref> Joyce Millman of [[Salon.com]] stated that she disliked [[The Seinfeld Chronicles|''Seinfeld''{{'}}s pilot episode]], but after seeing a scene from "The Ex-Girlfriend" in which Jerry and Kramer discuss returning fruit, she was "...awed by Seinfeld and co-creator/writer Larry David's brilliant grasp of, A) working-class Jewish craziness, and, B) the absurd humor of the deeply mundane."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/ent/tv/mill/1998/05/cov_04mill.html|author=Millman, Joyce|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|date=May 4, 1998|title=Cheerio, "Seinfeld"|accessdate=August 16, 2009}}</ref> In a review of the episode, Jon Burlingame of ''[[The Spokesman-Review]]'' stated "''Seinfeld'' is an offbeat take on the standard sitcom concept. While rarely hilarious, it's often smart and amusing."<ref>{{cite news|author=Burlingame, Jon|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sTwVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fAgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2501,4013478&dq=seinfeld|work=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|date=January 16, 1991|title=Seinfeld steps smartly back on to schedule|page=C3|location=[[Spokane, Washington]]|accessdate=August 16, 2009}}</ref> In his review of the episode, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' critic Rick Kogan stated: "Hip without posing, it delivers its comedy in sharp and spectacular style".<ref>{{cite news|title=Good, clean fun Jerry Seinfeld's summer series gets a chance where it counts|author=Kogan, Rick|date=January 16, 1991|page=5|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|location=[[Chicago, Illinois]]}}</ref>
