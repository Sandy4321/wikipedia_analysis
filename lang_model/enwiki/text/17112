'''Geothermal power''' (from the Greek roots ''geo'', meaning earth, and ''thermos'', meaning heat) is [[power (physics)|power]] extracted from heat stored in the earth. This [[geothermal (geology)|geothermal energy]] originates from the original formation of the planet, from [[radioactive decay]] of minerals, and from solar energy absorbed at the surface. It has been used for bathing since [[Paleolithic]] times and for [[space heating]] since ancient Roman times, but is now better known for generating electricity. Worldwide, geothermal plants have the capacity to generate about 10 [[gigawatt]]s of electricity as of 2007, and in practice supply 0.3% of global electricity demand. An additional 28 gigawatts  of direct [[geothermal heating]] capacity is installed for district heating, space heating, spas, industrial processes, desalination and agricultural applications.

Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly, but has historically been limited to areas near [[tectonic plate boundaries]]. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels. As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate [[global warming]] if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels.

The Earth's geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity's energy needs, but only a very small fraction of it may be profitably exploited. Drilling and exploration for deep resources costs tens of millions of dollars, and success is not guaranteed. Forecasts for the future penetration of geothermal power depend on assumptions about technology growth, the price of energy, subsidies, and interest rates.

{{Main|Geothermal heating|geothermal heat pump}}
Approximately 70 countries made direct use of a total of 270&nbsp;[[petajoules]]&nbsp;(PJ) of [[geothermal heating]] in 2004. More than half of this energy was used for space heating, and another third for heated pools. The remainder supported industrial and agricultural applications. The global installed capacity was 28&nbsp;GW, but capacity factors tend to be low (30% on average) since heat is mostly needed in the winter. The above figures are dominated by 88&nbsp;PJ of space heating extracted by an estimated 1.3&nbsp;million [[geothermal heat pump]]s with a total capacity of 15 GW.<ref name="IPCC" /> Heat pumps are the fastest-growing means of exploiting geothermal energy, with a global annual growth rate of 30% in energy production.<ref>{{Citation

</ref> Most of these new heat pumps are being installed for home heating.

Direct heating in all its forms is far more efficient than electricity generation and places less demanding temperature requirements on the heat resource. Heat may come from [[co-generation]] with a geothermal electrical plant or from smaller wells or heat exchangers buried in shallow ground. As a result, geothermal heating is economic over a much greater geographical range than geothermal electricity. Where natural [[hot springs]] are available, the heated water can be piped directly into [[radiators]]. If the ground is hot but dry, [[earth tubes]] or [[downhole heat exchanger]]s can collect the heat. But even in areas where the ground is colder than room temperature, heat can still be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than it can be produced by conventional furnaces.<ref name="strategic" /> These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques, and they frequently combine a variety of other functions, including [[air conditioning]], [[seasonal energy storage]], [[solar energy]] collection, and electric heating. Geothermal heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere in the world.

Geothermal heat supports many applications. [[District heating]] applications use networks of piped hot water to heat buildings in whole communities. In [[Reykjav<U+00ED>k]], Iceland, spent water from the district heating system is piped below the pavement and sidewalks to melt snow.<ref>{{Citation

Direct geothermal heating systems will contain pumps and compressors, and the electricity they consume may come from a polluting source. This [[parasitic load]] is normally a fraction of the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fuels, then the net pollution of geothermal heating may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a [[combined cycle]] [[natural gas]] plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas [[condensing furnace]] of the same size.<ref name="strategic">{{Citation | last1 = Hanova | first1 = J | last2 = Dowlatabadi | first2 = H | date =9 November 2007 | title =Strategic GHG reduction through the use of ground source heat pump technology | periodical =Environmental Research Letters | place =UK | publisher =IOP Publishing | volume =2 | pages = 044001 8pp | url =http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1748-9326/2/4/044001/erl7_4_044001.pdf?request-id=dd247af1-1eb0-4c8d-a20b-426d37d8ee5f | issn =1748-9326 | doi =10.1088/1748-9326/2/4/044001 | accessdate =2009-03-22}}</ref> Therefore the environmental value of direct geothermal heating applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring electric grid.

Geothermal has minimal land and freshwater requirements. Geothermal plants use 3.5&nbsp;square&nbsp;kilometres per&nbsp;gigawatt of electrical production (not capacity) versus 32 and 12&nbsp;square&nbsp;kilometres for coal facilities and wind farms respectively.<ref name="utilization" /> They use 20&nbsp;litres of freshwater per MW<U+00B7>h versus over 1000&nbsp;litres per&nbsp;MW<U+00B7>h for nuclear, coal, or oil.<ref name="utilization" />

== Economics ==
Geothermal power requires no fuel, and is therefore immune to fuel cost fluctuations, but capital costs tend to be high. Drilling accounts for over half the costs, and exploration of deep resources entails significant risks. A typical well doublet in Nevada can support 4.5 [[megawatt]]s (MW) of electricity generation and costs about $10&nbsp;million to drill, with a 20% failure rate.<ref name="econ101">{{Citation

Beneath the seasonal variations, the [[geothermal gradient]] of temperatures through the crust is 25<U+2013>30&nbsp;<U+00B0>C per [[kilometre]] (km) of depth in most of the world. The conductive heat [[flux]] is approximately 0.1&nbsp;MW/km<sup>2</sup> on average. These values are much higher near tectonic plate boundaries where the crust is thinner. They may be further augmented by fluid circulation, either through [[magma conduit]]s, [[hot springs]], [[hydrothermal circulation]] or a combination of these.

A geothermal heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground anywhere in the world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources.<ref name="utilization" /> The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The more demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a [[hot spring]].

Even though geothermal power is globally sustainable, extraction must still be monitored to avoid local depletion.<ref name="sustainability" /> Over the course of decades, individual wells draw down local temperatures and water levels until a new equilibrium is reached with natural flows. The three oldest sites, at Larderello, Wairakei, and the Geysers have all reduced production from their peaks because of local depletion. Heat and water, in uncertain proportions, were extracted faster than they were replenished. If production is reduced and water is reinjected, these wells could theoretically recover their full potential. Such mitigation strategies have already been implemented at some sites. The long-term sustainability of geothermal energy has been demonstrated at the Lardarello field in Italy since 1913, at the Wairakei field in New Zealand since 1958,<ref name="Wairakei">{{Citation

In 1892, America's first district heating system in [[Boise, Idaho]] was powered directly by geothermal energy, and was copied in [[Klamath Falls, Oregon]] in 1900. A deep geothermal well was used to heat greenhouses in Boise in 1926, and geysers were used to heat greenhouses in Iceland and Tuscany at about the same time.<ref name="Dickson">{{Citation

In the 20th&nbsp;century, demand for electricity led to the consideration of geothermal power as a generating source. Prince [[Piero Ginori Conti]] tested the first geothermal power generator on 4 July 1904, at the same Larderello dry steam field where geothermal acid extraction began. It successfully lit four light bulbs.<ref>Tiwari, G. N.; Ghosal, M. K. ''Renewable Energy Resources: Basic Principles and Applications.'' Alpha Science Int'l Ltd., 2005 ISBN 1842651250</ref> Later, in 1911, the world's first commercial geothermal power plant was built there. It was the world's only industrial producer of geothermal electricity until New Zealand built a plant in 1958.

By this time, [[Lord Kelvin]] had already invented the [[heat pump]] in 1852, and [[Heinrich Zoelly]] had patented the idea of using it to draw heat from the ground in 1912.<ref name="zogg">{{Citation
