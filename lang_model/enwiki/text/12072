'''Perdita Felicien''' (born August 29, 1980 in [[Oshawa, Ontario]], [[Canada]]) is a noted [[Canadian]] [[hurdling|hurdler]]. 

==Early life==
Felicien carries her mother's maiden name, whose origins are in the tiny [[Caribbean]] [[island nation]] of [[Saint Lucia]].  Her  mother named her "Perdita" after a contestant on the television game show, ''[[The Price is Right]]''.

Felicien grew up in [[Pickering, Ontario]], where, as a student, she began competing in track and field events at her school. At first, she competed in the 100m dash. Inspired by the success of World and [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] champions [[Donovan Bailey]] and [[Bruny Surin]] from Canada, Felicien dedicated herself to hurdling and won the [[Ontario]] high-school hurdling championship in 1997. She repeated as the Ontario champion in 1998 and that year added the first of two consecutive Canadian junior championships. Her performance at a scholastic meet in [[Ohio]] brought offers of athletic scholarships from a number of U.S. universities from which she chose the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] where she enrolled in the study of [[kinesiology]].

==Career==
Coached by Gary Winckler, in her first year competing at the university level, Perdita Felicien earned All-American honors and in the 100m hurdles set the record for the fastest time by a freshman in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] history for the event. The following year she was ranked No. 1 in the 100&nbsp;m hurdles by the NCAA for the entire outdoor season and was the first Illinois athlete to ever win a national championship during both the indoor and outdoor seasons. Her performance earned her the first of three consecutive University of Illinois Female Athlete of the Year awards and she was voted the U.S. Track Coaches Association National Female Outdoor Athlete of the Year.

In 2003, an undefeated Perdita Felicien won her second consecutive 100&nbsp;m hurdles national title en route to becoming the first University of Illinois female athlete to be named the [[Big Ten Conference]] "Athlete of the Year" while earning NCAA Female Track & Field Athlete of the Year honors. Felicien blossomed into a major force on the international scene in hurdling, topping off her season by winning the women's 100&nbsp;m Hurdles Final at the [[2003 World Championships in Athletics]] in [[Paris]], [[France]]. With her win, Felicien became Canada's first ever female world gold medallist and the first female in [[Illinois]] track & field history to win a gold medal in an individual event at the World Championships. She was named Canada's female athlete of the year <U+2013> the first track athlete to capture that honor in 25 years.

In March 2004, in a much-anticipated showdown with hurdling great [[Gail Devers]], Perdita Felicien set a new record in defeating the three-time hurdles world champion in the 60&nbsp;m hurdle final at the [[2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships]] in [[Budapest, Hungary]]. She chalked up six straight wins leading up to the [[2004 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens, Greece]], where she was expected to win gold in the 100&nbsp;m hurdles on August 24, especially after Devers pulled out with an injury. Unexpectedly, in the event final, Felicien failed to clear the first hurdle and fell into the adjacent lane knocking down the Russian competitor, [[Irina Shevchenko]] and taking her out of the race and a chance at an olympic medal, much to the obvious dismay of Shevchenko.

Felicien has returned to the track, and has had some success, winning medals at the world championships, alongside her teammate [[Priscilla Lopes-Schliep]]. In 2007, she won a silver medal at the world championships in the 100 metre hurdles.
s
On July 14, 2008, Felicien did not compete in the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], due to a foot injury. In August 2008, Felicien was a guest commentator for [[CBC Television]]'s 2008 Olympics coverage of hurdles. <ref> CBC Television, ''Olympic Morning'', 19 Aug 2008 </ref>
