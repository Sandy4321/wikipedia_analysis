The '''Spanish conquest of Pet<U+00E9>n''' was the last stage of the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|conquest of Guatemala]], a prolonged conflict during the [[Spanish colonisation of the Americas]]. A wide lowland plain covered with dense rainforest, Pet<U+00E9>n contains a central drainage basin with a series of lakes and areas of savannah. It is crossed by a number of ranges of low [[karst]]ic hills and rises to the south as it nears the [[Guatemalan Highlands]]. The conquest of [[Pet<U+00E9>n Department|Pet<U+00E9>n]], a region now incorporated into the modern republic of [[Guatemala]], climaxed in 1697 with the capture of [[Nojpet<U+00E9>n]], the island capital of the [[Itza people|Itza]] kingdom, by [[Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a|Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a y Arizmendi]]. With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the [[Americas]] fell to the European colonisers.

Sizeable [[Maya peoples|Maya]] populations existed in Pet<U+00E9>n before the conquest, particularly around the central lakes and along the rivers. Pet<U+00E9>n was divided into a number of different Maya polities engaged in a complex web of alliances and enmities. The most important groups around the central lakes were the Itza, the [[Yalain]] and the [[Kowoj]]. Other groups with territories in Pet<U+00E9>n included the [[Kejache]], the Acala, the [[Lakandon Ch'ol]], the Xocmo, the Chinamita, the Icaiche and the Manche Ch'ol.

Pet<U+00E9>n was first penetrated by [[Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s]] with a sizeable expedition that crossed the territory from north to south in 1525. In the first half of the 16th century [[Spain]] established neighbouring colonies in [[Yucat<U+00E1>n]] to the north and Guatemala to the south. Spanish missionaries laid the groundwork for the extension of colonial administration in the extreme south of Pet<U+00E9>n from 1596 onwards, but no further Spanish entry of central Pet<U+00E9>n took place until 1618 and 1619 when missionaries arrived at the Itza capital, having travelled from the Spanish town of [[M<U+00E9>rida, Yucat<U+00E1>n|M<U+00E9>rida]] in Yucat<U+00E1>n.

In 1628 the Manche Ch'ol of the south were placed under the administration of the colonial governor of Verapaz within the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]]. In 1622 a military expedition set out from Yucat<U+00E1>n led by Captain Francisco de Mirones and accompanied by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado; this expedition was a disaster, and the Spanish were massacred by the Itza. The Manche Ch'ol unsuccessfully rebelled against Spanish control in 1633. In 1695 a military expedition tried to reach Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> from Guatemala; this was followed in 1696 by missionaries from M<U+00E9>rida and in 1697 by Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a's expedition from Yucat<U+00E1>n that resulted in the final defeat of the independent kingdoms of central Pet<U+00E9>n and their incorporation into the Spanish Empire.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Guatemala}}
[[File:Pet<U+00E9>n savannah 1.jpg|thumb|right|alt=View across a flat grassy plain dotted with palm trees|Pet<U+00E9>n savannah]]
The modern [[Departments of Guatemala|department]] of Pet<U+00E9>n is located in northern Guatemala. It is bordered on the west by the [[Political divisions of Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Chiapas]]; this border largely follows the course of the [[Usumacinta River]]. On the north side Pet<U+00E9>n is bordered by the Mexican state of [[Campeche]] and on the northwest by the Mexican state of [[Tabasco]]; Pet<U+00E9>n is bordered on the east by [[Belize]]<ref>ITMB 1998.<br>ITMB 2000.</ref> and on the south side by the Guatemalan departments of [[Alta Verapaz Department|Alta Verapaz]] and [[Izabal Department|Izabal]].<ref>ITMB 1998.</ref>

The Pet<U+00E9>n lowlands are formed by a densely forested low-lying [[limestone]] plain featuring [[karstic]] topography.<ref>Lovell 2005, p. 17.</ref> The area is crossed by low east<U+2013>west oriented ridges of [[Cenozoic]] limestone and is characterised by a variety of forest and soil types; water sources include generally small rivers and low-lying seasonal swamps known as ''bajos''.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p46">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 46.</ref> A chain of fourteen lakes runs across the [[Pet<U+00E9>n Basin|central drainage basin]] of Pet<U+00E9>n; during the [[rainy season]] some of these lakes become interconnected. This [[drainage area]] measures approximately {{convert|100|km|mi}} east<U+2013>west by {{convert|30|km|mi}} north<U+2013>south.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 46<U+2013>47.</ref> The largest lake is [[Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itza]], near the centre of the drainage basin; it measures {{convert|32|by|5|km|mi}}. A broad [[savanna]]h extends south of the central lakes;  it has an average altitude of {{convert|150|m|ft}} [[above mean sea level]] with karstic ridges reaching an average altitude of {{convert|300|m|ft}}. The savannah features a compact red clay soil that is too poor to support heavy cultivation, which resulted in a relatively low level of [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] occupation. It is surrounded by hills with unusually steep southern slopes and gentler northern approaches; the hills are covered with dense tropical forest. To the north of the lakes region ''bajos'' become more frequent, interspersed with forest. In the far north of Pet<U+00E9>n the [[Mirador Basin]] forms another interior drainage region.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p47">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 47.</ref> To the south Pet<U+00E9>n reaches an altitude of approximately {{convert|500|m|ft}} as it rises towards the Guatemalan Highlands and meets [[Paleozoic]] metamorphic rocks.<ref name="RiceRice09p5">Rice and Rice 2009, p. 5.</ref>

===Climate===
The climate of Pet<U+00E9>n is divided into [[Wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s,<ref name="Schwartz90p17"/> although these seasons are not clearly defined in the south.<ref name="Schwartz90p18"/> The climate varies from [[Tropical climate|tropical]] in the south to [[Subtropics|semitropical]] in the north; temperature varies between {{convert|12|and|40|C|F}}, although it does not usually drop beneath {{convert|18|C|F}}.<ref name="Schwartz90p17">Schwartz 1990, p. 17.</ref> Mean temperature varies from {{convert|24.3|C|F}} in the southeast around [[Popt<U+00FA>n]] to {{convert|26.9|C|F}} around [[Uaxact<U+00FA>n]] in the northeast. Highest temperatures are reached from April to June, while January is the coldest month; all Pet<U+00E9>n experiences a hot dry period in late August. Annual precipitation is high, varying from a mean of {{convert|1198|mm|in}} in the northeast to {{convert|2007|mm|in}} in central Pet<U+00E9>n around [[Flores, El Pet<U+00E9>n|Flores]] (Nojpet<U+00E9>n). The extreme southeast of Pet<U+00E9>n experiences the largest variations in temperature and rainfall, with precipitation reaching as much as {{Convert|3000|mm|in}} in a year.<ref name="Schwartz90p18">Schwartz 1990, p. 18.</ref>

==Pet<U+00E9>n before the conquest==
The first large [[Maya city|Maya cities]] developed in PetEn as far back as the Middle Preclassic (c.&nbsp;600<U+2013>350&nbsp;BC),<ref>Estrada-Belli 2011, p. 52.</ref> and Pet<U+00E9>n formed the heartland of the ancient [[Maya civilization]] during the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic Era|Classic period]] (c.&nbsp;AD&nbsp;250<U+2013>900).<ref>Coe 1999, p. 31.<br>Webster 2002, p. 45.</ref> The great cities that dominated Pet<U+00E9>n had fallen into ruin by the beginning of the 10th century AD with the onset of the [[Classic Maya collapse]].<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 499<U+2013>500.</ref> A significant Maya presence remained into the [[Postclassic period]] after the abandonment of the major Classic period cities; the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 613, 616.</ref>

[[File:Contact Period lowland Guatemala.gif|thumb|left|350px|alt=Northern Guatemala is a flat lowland plain dropping off from the Cuchumatanes mountain range sweeping across in an arc to the south. To the east of the mountains is the large lowland Lake Izabal, with an outlet into the Amatique Bay to the east, which itself opens onto the Gulf of Honduras. Immediately north of the mountains is the Lacandon forest, with Pet<U+00E9>n to the northeast. Ystapalap<U+00E1>n was a settlement in the western Cuchumatanes, in the territory of the Chuj. Cob<U+00E1>n was in Q'eqchi' territory, in the foothills halfway between Ystapalap<U+00E1>n in the west and Lake Izabal in the east. Xocolo was at the northeastern extreme of Lake Izabal, where it flows out towards the sea. Nito, also known as Amatique, was on the coast where the river flowing out of the lake opened into the Amatique Bay. The area south of the lake was Toquegua territory. The Manche occupied the lands to the northwest of the lake, with the Acala to their west between the Manche and the Chuj. The Lacandon were northwest of the Acala, straddling the border with Mexico. Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> was in the centre of Pet<U+00E9>n, to the north. It was the location of Nojpet<U+00E9>n, with the Itza lands stretching southwards from the lake. To the east of the Itza and northeast of the Manche were the Mopan, on the border with Belize. North of the Mopan were the Yalain, east of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>. The Kowoj were to the northeast of the lake and the Kejache to the northwest. The "Tierra de Guerra" ("Land of War") covers a broad northern swathe of the mountains and the southern portion of the lowlands.|Map of the northern lowlands of Guatemala at the time of Spanish contact]]
Although there is insufficient data to accurately estimate population sizes at the time of contact with the Spanish, early Spanish reports suggest that sizeable Maya populations existed in Pet<U+00E9>n, particularly around the central lakes and along the rivers.<ref>Jones 2000, p. 351.</ref> Before their defeat in 1697 the Itza controlled or influenced much of Pet<U+00E9>n and parts of Belize. The Itza were warlike, and their martial prowess impressed both neighbouring Maya kingdoms and their Spanish enemies. Their capital was Nojpet<U+00E9>n, an island city upon [[Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>]]; it has developed into the modern town of Flores, which is the capital of the Pet<U+00E9>n department of Guatemala.<ref name="Jones00p353">Jones 2000, p. 353.</ref> The Itza spoke a variety of [[Yucatecan languages|Yucatecan Maya]].<ref name="Jones00p352">Jones 2000, p. 352.</ref>

The [[Ko'woj|Kowoj]] were the second in importance, and they were hostile towards their Itza neighbours. The Kowoj were located to the east of the Itza, around the eastern lakes: Lake Salpet<U+00E9>n, Lake Macanch<U+00E9>, [[Laguna Yaxh<U+00E1>|Lake Yaxh<U+00E1>]] and Lake Sacnab.<ref>Rice and Rice 2009, p. 10.<br>Rice 2009b, p. 17.</ref> Other groups are less well known, and their precise territorial extent and political makeup remains obscure; among them were the Chinamita, the Kejache, the Icaiche, the Lakandon [[Ch'ol people|Ch'ol]], the [[Mopan people|Mopan]], the Manche Ch'ol and the Yalain.<ref>Rice 2009b, p. 17.<br>Feldman 2000, p. xxi.</ref>

The Yalain appear to have been one of the three dominant polities in Postclassic central Pet<U+00E9>n, alongside the Itza and the Kowoj. The Yalain territory had its maximum extension from the east shore of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> eastwards to Tipuj in Belize.<ref name="Cecil99p788">Cecil et al 1999, p. 788.</ref> In the 17th century the Yalain capital was located at the site of that name on the north shore of [[Lake Macanch<U+00E9>]].<ref name="SharerTraxler2006p617">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 617.</ref> At the time of Spanish contact the Yalain were allied with the Itza, an alliance cemented by intermarriage between the elites of both groups.<ref name="Cecil99p788"/> In the late 17th century Spanish colonial records document hostilities between Maya groups in the lakes region, with the incursion of the Kowoj into former Yalain sites including [[Zacpeten]] on Lake Macanch<U+00E9> and [[Ixlu]] on [[Lake Salpet<U+00E9>n]].<ref name="RiceRice05p149">Rice and Rice 2005, p. 149.</ref>

The Kejache occupied a territory to the north of the Itza, between the lakes and what is now Campeche. To the west of them was [[Acalan]], inhabited by a [[Chontal Maya language|Chontal Maya]]-speaking group with their capital in the south of what is now Campeche state. The [[Ch'olan languages|Cholan Maya]]-speaking Lakandon (not to be confused with the modern inhabitants of Chiapas by that name) controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning southwestern Pet<U+00E9>n in Guatemala and eastern Chiapas.<ref name="Jones00p353"/> The Lakandon had a fierce reputation amongst the Spanish.<ref name="Houwald84p257">Houwald 1984, p. 257.</ref> The Xocmo were another Cholan-speaking group; they occupied the remote forest somewhere to the east of the Lakandon.<ref name="Jones00p353"/> Never conquered, the Xocmo escaped repeated Spanish attempts to locate them and their eventual fate is unknown. However, they may be ancestors of the modern [[Lacandon people]].<ref>Feldman 2000, p. 221.</ref> The Manche Ch'ol held territory in the extreme south of what is now the Pet<U+00E9>n department.<ref name="Jones00p353"/> The Mopan and the Chinamita had their polities in the southeastern Pet<U+00E9>n.<ref>Rice 2009b, p. 19.</ref> The Manche territory was to the southwest of the Mopan.<ref>Feldman 2000, p. xxi.</ref>

==Background to the conquest==
{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas}}
[[Christopher Columbus]] discovered the Americas for the [[Kingdom of Castile and Leon]] in 1492. By 1580 this had unified with a number of neighbouring kingdoms to form one Spanish kingdom. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule.<ref name="Feldman 2000, p. xix">Feldman 2000, p. xix.</ref> In the first decades after the discovery, the Spanish colonised the [[Caribbean]] and established a centre of operations on the island of [[Cuba]]. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the [[Aztec]]s on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast.<ref>Smith 1996, 2003, p. 272.</ref> By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish.<ref>Smith 1996, 2003, p. 276.</ref> Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]. The newly conquered territory became [[New Spain]], headed by a [[List of viceroys of New Spain|viceroy]] who answered to the Spanish Crown via the [[Council of the Indies]].<ref>Coe and Koontz 2002, p. 229.</ref> Cort<U+00E9>s despatched [[Pedro de Alvarado]] with an army to conquer the [[Mesoamerica]]n kingdoms of the Guatemalan [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas|Sierra Madre]] and neighbouring Pacific plain; the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541.<ref>Lovell 2005, pp. 58, 60.</ref> The Captaincy General of Guatemala had its capital at [[Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala]] (modern [[Antigua Guatemala]]) and covered a wide territory that also included the Mexican state of Chiapas as well as [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]] and [[Costa Rica]].<ref>Hardoy 1991, pp. 9, 10n6.</ref> The Spanish imposed colonial rule over Yucat<U+00E1>n between 1527 and 1546, and over Verapaz from the 16th to the 17th centuries, leaving the area between&nbsp;<U+2013> essentially Pet<U+00E9>n and much of Belize&nbsp;<U+2013> independent long after surrounding peoples had been subjugated.<ref>Schwartz 1990, p. 33.</ref>

==Impact of Old World diseases==
A single soldier arriving in Mexico in 1520 was carrying [[smallpox]] and thus initiated the devastating plagues that swept through the native populations of the Americas.<ref>Smith 1996, 2003, p. 279.</ref> The European diseases that ravaged the indigenous inhabitants of the Americas also severely affected the various Maya groups of Pet<U+00E9>n. It is estimated that there were approximately 30,000 Ch'ol and [[Ch'olti' language|Ch'olti']] Maya in western Pet<U+00E9>n at the start of the 16th century. Between 1559 and 1721 they were devastated by a combination of disease, war and enforced relocations.<ref name="Schwartz90p34"/>

When Nojpet<U+00E9>n fell in 1696 there were approximately 60,000 Maya living around Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>, including a considerable number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of the inhabitants died during the first decade of colonial rule because of disease and war.<ref name="Jones00p364">Jones 2000, p. 364.</ref> Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, internecine warfare between rival Maya groups and Spanish expeditions also took their toll.<ref name="Jones09p60">Jones 2009, p. 60.</ref>

==Weaponry and armour==

Conquistadors often wore steel armour that included chainmail and helmets.<ref>MacQuarrie, 2007, 2012, loc. 2362.</ref> The Spanish were sufficiently impressed by the quilted cotton armour of their Maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armour.<ref>Phillips 2006, 2007, p. 94.</ref> Maya weaponry was not sufficiently powerful to justify the discomfort of wearing European armour. Quilted cotton armour, although still uncomfortably hot, was flexible and weighed much less. The Maya armour was adapted by the Spanish, who used knee-length quilted cotton tunics and Spanish-style caps. Horsemen wore long quilted cotton leg protectors; their horses were also protected with padded cotton armour.<ref>Clendinnen 1988, 2003, p. 27.</ref> After the final push to the Pet<U+00E9>n lakes in early 1697, the Spanish recorded that they left with their garrison over 50 Dutch- and French-made [[musket]]s, three {{convert|1|lb|kg|adj=on}} calibre light [[History of cannon|cannons]] (''piezas'') cast from iron and mounted on carriages, four iron and two bronze ''[[Bombard (weapon)|pedreros]]'' (2-chambered stone-launchers) and six of at least eight bronze light cannons (known as ''esmiriles'').<ref name="Jones  1998 268 269">Jones  1998, pp. 268<U+2013>269.</ref>

===Native weaponry===
{{Rquote|left|...&nbsp;The two [Itza] Captains bore their Lances with points of Flint, like ours, which differ from them only in being of Steel, and at the heads of them are many Plumes of divers and beautiful colors like the Ribbons our Standard-bearers use on their darts; and the points are as much as a quarter of a [[Spanish customary units|vara]] long and have two cutting-edges, and the point is like a very sharp Dagger.

The other Itzaex Indians bore their Bows and Arrows with which they always march when they come forth from their Island&nbsp;... in case they meet the Chinamitas, a Nation for whom they have always had enmity, and continual wars; for they hold themselves as brave warriors like the Itzas themselves.<ref>Means 1917, p. 66.</ref>|Juan de Villagutierre Soto-Mayor, 1701<br>Book II, Chapter II, p. 92.}}
The Spanish described the weapons of war of the Pet<U+00E9>n Maya as bows and arrows, [[Fire hardening|fire-sharpened]] poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords known as ''hadzab'' that were crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]];<ref>Rice et al. 2009, p. 129.</ref> these were similar to the Aztec ''[[macuahuitl]]''. They had a thin, wide wooden shaft with obsidian or flint blades set into channels in the wood. The shaft was up to {{convert|80|cm|in}} long and was crafted from the hard, dark wood of a flowering tree (''[[Apoplanesia]] paniculata'') called ''chulul'' by the Maya. The bows used by the Maya were described as almost as high as a man and were made from the same ''chulul'' wood as the ''hadzab'', with the bowstring fashioned from [[henequen]] fibre; the bow was called a ''chuhul''.<ref>Rice et al. 2009, p. 130.</ref> Arrows were made from reeds with flint, bone or fishtooth arrowheads and flights crafted from feathers.<ref>Rice et al. 2009, pp. 130<U+2013>131.</ref> In hand-to-hand combat the Maya used daggers with obsidian or flint blades set into a ''chulul''-wood handle, they were about {{convert|20|cm|in}} long. Maya spears were referred to as ''nabte''; sometimes the tip was fire-hardened, sometimes they were set with a stone blade. Spears were mainly used to thrust and slash but they could also be thrown as a javelin. The Maya used several different sizes of spear with the smaller spears probably employed as a missile; the longer spears were a similar size as those used by the Spanish.<ref>Rice et al. 2009, p. 131.</ref>

Distinguished Maya warriors entered battle wearing armour. The upper body was covered by a short jacket that was filled with rock salt, and the forearms and legs were protected with tight bindings of cloth or leather. The salt-packed cotton armour was tough enough that even arrows could not penetrate it. Armour could be decorated and was often adorned with feathers. Commoners did not wear armour in battle, usually only wearing a loincloth and warpaint. Warriors carried shields made from two right-angled wooden bars with deerskin stretched across them.<ref>Rice et al. 2009, p. 132.</ref>

==Strategies and tactics==
The Spanish were aware that the Itza Maya had become the centre of anti-Spanish resistance and engaged in a policy of encircling their kingdom and cutting their [[Trade in Maya civilization|trade routes]] over the course of almost two hundred years. The Itza resisted this steady encroachment by recruiting their neighbours as allies against the Spanish advance.<ref name="Jones00p361">Jones 2000, p. 361.</ref> The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or ''[[Indian Reductions|reducciones]]'' (also known as ''congregaciones'').<ref>Rice 2009a, p. 83.</ref> Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements  took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish.<ref>Pugh 2009, p. 191.<br>Houwald 1984, p. 256.</ref> Those that remained behind in the ''reducciones'' often fell victim to contagious diseases.<ref name="Houwald84p256"/>

In addition to military expeditions, a contract for conquest was issued to the [[Dominican Order]], which engaged missionaries for the peaceful pacification of native populations so they would accept Roman Catholicism and submit to Spanish rule. This tactic worked in the neighouring mountains of Verapaz to the south, although their success there was aided by the threat of Spanish garrisons stationed within striking distance. In the lowland Pet<U+00E9>n this approach was not so successful, since the Maya could disappear easily into the rainforest leaving the Spanish with deserted settlements.<ref name="Feldman 2000, p. xix"/> Likewise, the [[Franciscan Order]] engaged in generally peaceful attempts to incorporate the Maya into the Spanish Empire via the attempted Christian conversion of native leaders.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 290<U+2013>291.</ref> However, the Franciscan Order routinely embraced the practice of missionary violence, including [[corporal punishment]] and the defence of the idea of "[[religious war|holy war]]" against non-Christians.<ref name="Webre04p6"/> In many cases the Maya remained Christian only while the missionaries were present, and they would immediately become  [[apostasy|apostate]]  as soon as the friars left.<ref name="Houwald84p256"/> In Guatemala in the late 17th century, the Franciscan friar Francisco de As<U+00ED>s V<U+00E1>zquez de Herrera argued that war against apostate Indians was obligatory.<ref name="Webre04p6">Webre 2004, p. 6.</ref> Missionary penetration of Pet<U+00E9>n was not risk-free, and many missionaries were killed in the region.<ref name="Houwald84p256">Houwald 1984, p. 256.</ref>

In 1525, after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s led an expedition to Honduras over land, cutting across the Itza kingdom in what is now the northern Pet<U+00E9>n Department of Guatemala.<ref name="Jones00p358">Jones 2000, p. 358.</ref> His aim was to subdue the rebellious [[Crist<U+00F3>bal de Olid]], whom he had sent to conquer Honduras; Olid had, however, set himself up independently on his arrival in that territory.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 761.</ref> Cort<U+00E9>s had 140 Spanish soldiers, 93 of them mounted, 3,000 Mexican warriors, 150 horses, a herd of pigs, artillery, munitions and other supplies. He also had with him 600 [[Chontal Maya people|Chontal Maya]] carriers from Acalan. They arrived at the north shore of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> on 13 March 1525.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p761762">Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 761<U+2013>762.</ref>

The Roman Catholic priests accompanying the expedition celebrated mass in the presence of [[Kan Ek'|Aj Kan Ek']], the king of the Itza, who was said to be so impressed that he pledged to worship the cross and to destroy his idols.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p762">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 762.</ref> Cort<U+00E9>s accepted an invitation from Kan Ek' to visit Nojpet<U+00E9>n (also known as Tayasal), and crossed to the Maya city with 20 Spanish soldiers while the rest of his army continued around the lake to meet him on the south shore.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 762.<br>Jones 2000, p. 358.</ref> On his departure from Nojpet<U+00E9>n, Cort<U+00E9>s left behind a cross and a lame horse that the Itza treated as a deity, attempting to feed it poultry, meat and flowers, but the animal soon died.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 773.<br>Jones 2000, p. 358.</ref> The Spanish did not officially contact the Itza again until the arrival of [[Franciscan]] priests in 1618, when Cort<U+00E9>s' cross was said to still be standing at Nojpet<U+00E9>n.<ref name="Jones00p358" />

From the lake, Cort<U+00E9>s continued south along the western slopes of the [[Maya Mountains]], a particularly arduous journey that took 12 days to cover {{convert|32|km|mi}}, during which he lost more than two-thirds of his horses. When he came to a river swollen with the constant torrential rains that had been falling during the expedition, Cort<U+00E9>s turned upstream to the Gracias a Dios rapids, which took two days to cross and cost him more horses.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p762"/>

On 15 April 1525 the expedition arrived at the Maya village of Tenciz. With local guides they headed into the hills north of [[Lake Izabal]], where their guides abandoned them to their fate. The expedition became lost in the hills and came close to starvation before they captured a Maya boy who led them to safety.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p762" /> Cort<U+00E9>s found a village on the shore of Lake Izabal, perhaps Xocolo. He crossed the [[Dulce River (Guatemala)|Dulce River]] to the settlement of Nito, somewhere on the [[Amatique Bay]],<ref name="Feldman98p6">Feldman 1998, p. 6.</ref> with about a dozen companions, and waited there for the rest of his army to regroup over the next week.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p762" /> By this time the remnants of the expedition had been reduced to a few hundred; Cort<U+00E9>s succeeded in contacting the Spaniards he was searching for, only to find that Crist<U+00F3>bal de Olid's own officers had already put down his rebellion. Cort<U+00E9>s then returned to Mexico by sea.<ref>Webster 2002, p. 83.</ref>

==Prelude to conquest==
From 1527 onwards the Spanish were increasingly active in the Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula, establishing a number of colonies and towns by 1544, including [[Campeche, Campeche|Campeche]] and [[Valladolid, Yucat<U+00E1>n|Valladolid]] in what is now Mexico.<ref>Jones 2000, pp. 358<U+2013>360.</ref> The Spanish impact on the northern Maya, encompassing invasion, epidemic diseases and the export of up to 50,000 Maya slaves, caused many Maya to flee southwards to join the Itza around Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>, within the modern borders of Guatemala.<ref>Jones 2000, pp. 360<U+2013>361.</ref>

Dominican missionaries were active in Verapaz and the southern Pet<U+00E9>n from the late 16th century through the 17th century, attempting non-violent conversion with limited success. In the 17th century, the Franciscans came to the conclusion that the pacification and Christian conversion of the Maya would not be possible as long as the Itza held out at Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>. The constant flow of escapees fleeing the Spanish-held territories to find refuge with the Itza was a drain on the workforce managed by the ''[[encomienda]]'' system.<ref name="Jones00p361" />

===Missions in southern Pet<U+00E9>n===
{{Maya civilization}}
The first Catholic missionaries entered southern Pet<U+00E9>n in 1596 to convert the Manche Ch'ol and the Mopan.<ref name="Schwartz90p35"/> The Q'eqchi' of Verapaz long had close ties with the Manche Ch'ol.<ref name="CasoBarrera&Aliphat07p48"/> The colonial Maya towns of [[Cob<U+00E1>n]] and [[Santa Mar<U+00ED>a Cahab<U+00F3>n|Cahab<U+00F3>n]], in Alta Verapaz, traded [[Resplendent Quetzal|quetzal]] feathers, [[copal]], chile, cotton, salt and Spanish-produced iron tools with their lowland Lakandon and Manche Ch'ol neighbours, receiving [[Cocoa bean|cacao]] and [[Bixa orellana|achiote]] in exchange.<ref>Caso Barrera and Aliphat 2007, pp. 49, 51.</ref> Many Q'eqchi' from Verapaz fled Spanish control to settle among the Lakand<U+00F3>n and Manche Ch'ol. These fugitives strengthened the existing ties between the independent Ch'ol and the Spanish-controlled Maya of Verapaz;<ref>Caso Barrera and Aliphat 2007, p. 51.</ref> the constant flow of Maya between colonial Verapaz and independent Pet<U+00E9>n led to religious [[syncretism]] that the Spanish religious authorities were unable to prevent.<ref>Caso Barrera and Aliphat 2007, p. 53.</ref> This relationship did not hinder the Spanish from using the Q'eqchi' to help conquer and reduce the Manche Ch'ol.<ref name="CasoBarrera&Aliphat07p48">Caso Barrera and Aliphat 2007, p. 48.</ref>

From the middle of the 16th century the Dominican Order had been tasked with the peaceful conversion of the Ch'ol of Verapaz and southern Pet<U+00E9>n, and their concentration into new colonial towns.<ref>Webre 2004, pp. 1<U+2013>2.</ref> The Itza became fearful that the newly converted Manche Ch'ol would lead the Spanish to Nojpet<U+00E9>n.<ref name="Schwartz90p35"/> In 1628 the towns of the Manche Ch'ol were placed under the administration of the governor of Verapaz, with Dominican friar Francisco Mor<U+00E1>n as their ecclesiastical head.<ref>Feldman 2000, pp. xxii, 234.</ref> Mor<U+00E1>n favoured a more robust approach to the conversion of the Manche and moved Spanish soldiers into the region to protect against raids from the Itza to the north.<ref name="Feldman00pxxii"/>  The new Spanish garrison in an area that had not previously seen a heavy Spanish military presence provoked the Manche to revolt, which was followed by abandonment of the indigenous settlements.<ref name="Feldman00pxxii">Feldman 2000, p. xxii.</ref> The Itza, worried about the southern approaches to their territory, may have instigated a Manche rebellion that took place in Lent 1633.<ref name="Schwartz90p35"/>

Towards the end of the 17th century Spanish priorities changed, and the failure of the peaceful efforts of the Dominicans to convert the Ch'ol combined with the increasing British presence in the Caribbean led the colonial authorities to end the Dominican monopoly and allow the Franciscans and other orders to enter the region;<ref>Webre 2004, pp. 2, 7.</ref> military options were also viewed more favourably.<ref name="Webre04p2">Webre 2004, p. 2.</ref>  Between 1685 and 1689, the Q'eqchi' of Cob<U+00E1>n and Cahab<U+00F3>n were forced to assist the Spanish in their armed expeditions against the Manche Ch'ol and in forcibly relocating them to Verapaz. These actions depopulated the southern Pet<U+00E9>n and led to the breakdown of the trade routes linking colonial Guatemala with the independent Maya of Pet<U+00E9>n.<ref>Caso Barrera and Aliphat 2007, p. 57.</ref> From 1692 to 1694, Franciscan friars [[Antonio Margil de Jes<U+00FA>s|Antonio Margil]] and Melchor L<U+00F3>pez were active among the Manche and Lakandon Ch'ol. They were eventually expelled by the Ch'ol;<ref>Webre 2004, p. 11.</ref> upon their return to Santiago de Guatemala they proposed three invasion routes into southern Pet<U+00E9>n and neighbouring Chiapas.<ref>Webre 2004, p. 12.</ref> Throughout the 17th century, Spanish missionaries encountered considerable reticence among the Manche, until the Spanish finally decided to move them to an area where they could be more easily controlled. At the time of contact there were perhaps 10,000 Manche; these were devastated by war and disease, with the survivors relocated to [[Rabinal]] in the modern department of [[Baja Verapaz Department|Baja Verapaz]]. After 1700 the Manche Ch'ol ceased to play any part in the history of Pet<U+00E9>n.<ref name="Schwartz90p35">Schwartz 1990, p. 35.</ref>

The Mopan population has been estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 people at the time of contact. In 1692 the Council of the Indies ordered that the Manche Ch'ol and the Mopan be dealt with decisively. The population suffered the effects of war and disease, and the few survivors were moved into Spanish ''reducciones'' in southeastern Pet<U+00E9>n, before being moved to colonial settlements in other parts of Pet<U+00E9>n.<ref name="Schwartz90p35"/> In 1695 the colonial authorities decided to act upon a plan to connect the province of Guatemala with Yucat<U+00E1>n, and soldiers commanded by [[Jacinto de Barrios Leal]], president of the [[Royal Audiencia of Guatemala]],<ref>Jones 1998, p. 120.</ref> conquered a number of Ch'ol communities.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 232.<br>Jones 2000, p. 362.</ref> The most important of these was Sakb'ajlan on the [[Lacant<U+00FA>n River]] in eastern Chiapas, now in Mexico, which was renamed as Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de Dolores, or Dolores del Lakandon, in April 1695.<ref>Jones 2000, p. 362.<br>Jones 1998, pp. 132<U+2013>133.</ref> This was one part of a three-pronged attack against the independent inhabitants of Pet<U+00E9>n and neighbouring Chiapas; a second group joined up with Barrios Leal having marched from [[Huehuetenango]]. The third group, under Juan D<U+00ED>az de Velasco, marched from Verapaz against the Itza.<ref name="Houwald84p257"/> Barrios Leal was accompanied by Franciscan friar Antonio Margil who served as an advisor as well as his personal confessor and chaplain to his troops.<ref name="Webre04p13">Webre 2004, p. 13.</ref> The Spanish built a fort and garrisoned it with 30 Spanish soldiers. [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy|Mercederian]] friar Diego de Rivas was based at Dolores del Lakandon, and he and his fellow Mercederians baptised several hundred Lakandon Ch'ols in the following months and established contacts with neighbouring Ch'ol communities.<ref name="Jones 1998, p. 232">Jones 1998, p. 232.</ref>

Resistance against the Spanish continued, and hostile Ch'ol killed a number of newly baptised Christian Indians.<ref name="Webre04p13"/> In early March 1696 such was the success of the friars that captain Jacobo de Alzayaga and the Mercederians decided to try to reach Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>. They headed eastwards towards the [[Pasi<U+00F3>n River]] with 150 heavily armed soldiers plus native guides, travelling in five large canoes. They got as far as the savannah to the southeast of the lake before turning back for unknown reasons.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 243.</ref> Antonio Margil remained in Dolores del Lakandon until 1697.<ref name="Webre04p13"/> The Ch'ol of the [[Lacandon Jungle]] were resettled in [[Huehuetenango Department|Huehuetenango]] in the early 18th century.<ref name="Jones00p365">Jones 2000, p. 365.</ref>

Nojpet<U+00E9>n fell to a Spanish assault on 13 March 1697, more than 150 years after the conquest of the rest of the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]] and more than 160 years after the conquest of the Guatemalan Highlands.<ref>Jones 1998, p. xix.<br>Lovell 2005, p. 66.<br>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 618.</ref> The lengthy delay in conquering the Pet<U+00E9>n region was due to a combination of its geographical remoteness and inhospitality and the fierce reputation of its Maya inhabitants.<ref name="Jones98pxix"/> During this time the Itza used the Yalain as an eastern buffer against Spanish approach from Belize.<ref name="Cecil99p788"/> The lengthy indirect contact between the Itza and the Spanish invaders allowed the Itza to develop an understanding of Spanish strategy and tactics that was honed over the period of almost two centuries that the Itza were surrounded by European-dominated territories. This understanding distinguished the conquest of Pet<U+00E9>n from the 16th-century conquests of the Aztecs, Maya and [[Inca Empire|Incas]]. In contrast, the Spanish had a very poor understanding of the Itza and their neighbours and viewed them as ignorant savages  whose kingdom was protected by Satan from the Christianising efforts of the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].<ref name="Jones98pxxi">Jones 1998, p. xxi.</ref> From the time that Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s crossed Pet<U+00E9>n in the early 16th century, the Spanish mistakenly believed the king of the Itza (the ''Aj Kan Ek''') was the overlord of the entire central Pet<U+00E9>n region.<ref name="SharerTraxler2006p617"/>

Following Cort<U+00E9>s' visit, no Spanish attempted to visit the warlike Itza inhabitants of Nojpet<U+00E9>n for almost a hundred years. In 1618 two Franciscan friars set out from M<U+00E9>rida in Yucat<U+00E1>n on a mission to attempt the peaceful conversion of the still pagan Itza in central Pet<U+00E9>n. Bartolom<U+00E9> de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita were accompanied by some Christianised Maya.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p773"/> Andr<U+00E9>s Carrillo de Pern<U+00ED>a, a ''[[Criollo people|Criollo]]'' who was the ''[[alcalde]]'' of [[Bacalar, Quintana Roo|Bacalar]] (a colonial official),{{refn|group=nb|Two Spanish colonial settlements in Quintana Roo bore the name Bacalar.

They stayed at Nojpet<U+00E9>n for some days in an attempt to evangelise the Itza, but the Aj Kan Ek' refused to renounce his [[Maya religion]], although he showed interest in the masses held by the Catholic missionaries. Kan Ek' informed them that according to ancient Itza prophecy it was not yet time for them to convert. In the time since Cort<U+00E9>s had visited Nojpet<U+00E9>n, the Itza had made a statue of the deified horse. Juan de Orbita was outraged when he saw the idol and he immediately smashed it into pieces. Fuensalida was able to save the lives of the visitors from the infuriated natives by means of a particularly eloquent sermon that resulted in them being forgiven. Attempts to convert the Itza failed, and the friars left Nojpet<U+00E9>n on friendly terms with Kan Ek'.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p773">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 773.</ref>

The friars returned in 1619, arriving in October and staying for eighteen days. Again Kan Ek' welcomed them in a friendly manner, but this time the [[Maya priesthood]] were hostile and jealous of the missionaries' influence upon the king. They persuaded Kan Ek's wife to convince him to expel the unwelcome visitors. The missionaries' lodgings were surrounded by armed warriors, and the friars and their accompanying servants were escorted to a waiting canoe and instructed to leave and never return.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p773"/> Juan de Orbita attempted to resist and was rendered unconscious by an Itza warrior. The missionaries were expelled without food or water but survived the journey back to M<U+00E9>rida.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p774">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 774.</ref>

Before the early 17th century, the western Pet<U+00E9>n had been heavily populated by Ch'ol and Ch'olti' Maya and was an important trade route for the Itza. By the mid-17th century, these populations had been devastated by war, disease and the enforced movement of the inhabitants into colonial settlements, negating the economic importance of the region for the Itza.<ref name="Schwartz90p34">Schwartz 1990, p. 34.</ref> At the same time the Kejache were becoming important intermediaries between the Itza and Yucat<U+00E1>n. The Putun Acalan subgroup of the Kejache had previously traded directly with the Itza but had been relocated by the Spanish. The remaining Kejache, devastated by disease and subject to the intense attentions of Spanish missionaries, were no longer able to supply the Itza directly and became middlemen instead.<ref>Schwartz 1990, pp. 34<U+2013>35.</ref>

====Spanish setbacks in the 1620s====
In March 1622, governor of Yucat<U+00E1>n [[Diego de Cardenas]] ordered captain Francisco de Mirones Lezcano to launch an assault upon the Itza; he set out from Yucat<U+00E1>n with 20 Spanish soldiers and 80 Mayas from Yucat<U+00E1>n.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 774.<br>Jones 1998, p. 46.<br>Chuchiak IV 2005, p. 131.</ref> His expedition was later joined by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p774"/> The expedition first camped at IxPimienta; in May they moved to Sakalum, southwest of Bacalar, where there was a lengthy delay while they waited for reinforcements.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 42, 47.</ref> En route to Nojpet<U+00E9>n, Delgado believed that the soldiers' treatment of the Maya was excessively cruel, and he left the expedition to make his own way to Nojpet<U+00E9>n with eighty Christianised Maya from [[Tipu, Belize|Tipuj]] in Belize.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p774"/> In the meantime the Itza had learnt of the approaching military expedition and had become hardened against further Spanish missionary attempts.<ref>Chuchiak IV 2005, p. 132.</ref> When Mirones learnt of Delgado's departure, he sent 13 soldiers to persuade him to return or continue as his escort should he refuse. The soldiers caught up with him just before Tipuj, but he was determined to reach Nojpet<U+00E9>n.<ref>Means 1917, p. 79.</ref> From Tipuj, Delgado sent a messenger to Kan Ek', asking permission to travel to Nojpet<U+00E9>n; the Itza king replied with a promise of safe passage for the missionary and his companions. The party was initially received in peace at the Itza capital,<ref>Means 1917, p. 80.</ref> but as soon as the Spanish soldiers let their guard down, the Itza seized and bound the new arrivals.<ref name="Means1917p81">Means 1917, p. 81.</ref> The soldiers were [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrificed]] to the [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|Maya gods]], with their hearts cut from their chests and their heads impaled on stakes around the town.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 774.<br>Means 1917, p. 81.</ref> After the sacrifice of the Spanish soldiers, the Itza took Delgado, cut his heart out and dismembered him; they displayed his head on a stake with the others.<ref>Means 1917, p. 81.<br>Jones 1998, pp. 47<U+2013>48.</ref> The fate of the leader of Delgado's Maya companions was no better. With no word from Delgado's escort, Mirones sent two Spanish soldiers with Bernadino Ek, a Maya scout, to learn their fate. When they arrived upon the shore of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>, the Itza took them across to their island capital and imprisoned them. They escaped to a canoe by the lakeshore but the two Spanish, slowed by their bonds, were soon recaptured. Ek escaped and returned to Mirones with the news.<ref name="Means1917p81"/>

Soon afterwards, on 27 January 1624, an Itza war party led by AjK'in P'ol caught Mirones and his soldiers off guard and unarmed in the church at Sakalum<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 774.<br>Jones 1998, p. 48.</ref> and slaughtered them.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p774"/> Spanish reinforcements led by Juan Bernardo Casanova arrived too late; the Spanish soldiers had been hanged and beheaded, with their corpses burned; Mirones had been sacrificed with his heart cut out. A number of local Maya men and women had also been hanged but not decapitated, and the attackers had burned the town.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 48.</ref>

Following these massacres, Spanish garrisons were stationed in several towns in southern Yucat<U+00E1>n, and rewards were offered for the whereabouts of AjK'in P'ol. The Maya governor of [[Oxkutzcab Municipality|Oxkutzcab]], Fernando Kamal, set out with 150 Maya archers to track the warleader down; they succeeded in capturing the Itza captain and his followers, together with silverware from the looted Sakalum church and items belonging to Mirones. The prisoners were taken back to the Spanish captain Antonio M<U+00E9>ndez de Canzo, interrogated under torture, tried, and condemned to be [[hanged, drawn and quartered]]. They were decapitated, and the heads were displayed in the plazas of towns throughout the colonial ''Partido de la Sierra'' in what is now Mexico's Yucat<U+00E1>n state.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 48<U+2013>49.</ref> These events ended all Spanish attempts to contact the Itza until 1695.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p774"/> In the 1640s internal strife in Spain distracted the government from attempts to conquer unknown lands; the Spanish Crown lacked the time, money or interest in such colonial adventures for the next four decades.<ref>Feldman 2000, p. 151.</ref>

In 1692 [[Basque people|Basque]] nobleman Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a y Arizmendi proposed to the Spanish king the construction of a road from M<U+00E9>rida southwards to link with the Guatemalan colony, in the process "reducing" any independent native populations into colonial ''congregaciones''; this was part of a greater plan to subjugate the Lakandon and Manche Ch'ol of southern Pet<U+00E9>n and the upper reaches of the Usumacinta River.

In December 1695 the Spanish colonial authorities in M<U+00E9>rida received a diplomatic visit sent by the Aj Kan Ek'.<ref name="Jones98p168">Jones 1998, p. 168.</ref> The diplomatic contact had been negotiated by Spanish captain Francisco Hariza y Arruyo, ''alcalde'' of Bacalar-at-Chunjujub'. Hariza had sent a Christian Maya ambassador to Nojpet<U+00E9>n from Tipuj in April 1695,<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 168<U+2013>169.</ref> who arrived around the same time that the Itza were preparing to defend themselves against a Spanish party entering from Guatemala; nonetheless the emissary was received in peace and despatched back to Hariza with promises of submission to Spain.<ref name="Jones98p171-172"/> In August Hariza travelled to M<U+00E9>rida in the company of a group of seven Tipuj natives offering submission to Spain.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 169<U+2013>170.</ref> However, in reality four members of this party were not from Tipuj at all, but were Itza diplomats sent incognito from Yalain to discuss possible peaceful contacts with the colonial authorities.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 170<U+2013>171.</ref> The leader of the Itza delegation was AjChan,<ref>Jones 1998, p. 170.</ref> a nephew of the Itza king.<ref name="Jones98p167"/> When friar Avenda<U+00F1>o was in M<U+00E9>rida in September 1695 between attempts to reach Nojpet<U+00E9>n, he met with the Itza<U+2013>Yalain delegation and was able to give an account of them when he travelled through Yalain after visiting Nojpet<U+00E9>n in January 1696.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 170, 187, 216<U+2013>217.</ref> AjChan and his companions returned to Nojpet<U+00E9>n in November but did not stay long before leaving for M<U+00E9>rida again.<ref name="Jones98p175">Jones 1998, p. 175.</ref>

In December, Kan Ek' despatched AjChan to negotiate peace with Spain,<ref name="Jones98p167-168">Jones 1998, pp. 167<U+2013>168.</ref> with three Itza companions. They were accompanied to M<U+00E9>rida by a small number of Mopans from the Tipuj region.<ref name="Jones98p175"/> AjChan, through family ties and marriage, had a key role as a middleman between the Itza, Yalain and Kowoj; he also had family ties with the semi-Christianised Maya at Tipuj, and his mother was from [[Chichen Itza]] in the northern Yucat<U+00E1>n. His marriage to a Kowoj woman had been an attempt, ultimately unsuccessful, to defuse Itza<U+2013>Kowoj hostility. Kan Ek' sent AjChan to M<U+00E9>rida with a message of peaceful submission to the Spanish Empire in an attempt to solidify his own position as sole ruler of the Itza, even if this meant sacrificing Itza independence from Spain.<ref name="Jones98p167">Jones 1998, p. 167.</ref> The Itza king's uncle and the Kowoj were fundamentally opposed to any negotiations with the Spanish and viewed AjChan's embassy as treachery.<ref name="Jones98p167-168"/> The Spanish were unaware of the tensions between different Maya factions in central Pet<U+00E9>n, which by now had escalated into a state of inter-Maya warfare. AjChan was baptised as Mart<U+00ED>n Francisco on 31 December 1695, with Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a, governor of Yucat<U+00E1>n, acting as his godfather.<ref name="Jones98p168"/>

The arrival of AjChan and his subsequent baptism was an important diplomatic coup for Urs<U+00FA>a, who used the visit for his own political advancement, promoting the embassy as the peaceful final submission of the Itza kingdom to the Spanish Crown.<ref name="Jones98p168"/> This formal submission of the Itza kingdom to Spain was a critical turning point, since from a Spanish legal viewpoint the Itza were now subjects and the royal prohibition on military conquest could be sidestepped.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 186.</ref> AjChan left M<U+00E9>rida with his companions and a Spanish escort in the middle of January 1696 and arrived back at Tipuj around the end of the month. After a few days at Tipuj he learnt of violent events unfolding around Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> including the battle at Ch'ich' and the subsequent killing of two Franciscans. Fearing the response of his Spanish escort, he abandoned them and fled back to Yalain.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 230<U+2013>231.</ref>

====Garc<U+00ED>a de Paredes' entry from Yucat<U+00E1>n, March <U+2013> April 1695====
The governor of Yucat<U+00E1>n, [[Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a y Arizmendi]], began to build the road from Campeche south towards Pet<U+00E9>n.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p774"/> At the beginning of March 1695, Urs<U+00FA>a ordered captain Alonso Garc<U+00ED>a de Paredes to explore this road; Garc<U+00ED>a led a group of 50 Spanish soldiers, accompanied by native guides, muleteers and labourers. Garc<U+00ED>a had previous experience from military expeditions around Sajkab'chen (near modern Xcabacab in southern Campeche state).<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 129<U+2013>130.<br>ITMB 2000.</ref> The expedition advanced some way south of Sajkab'chen into Kejache territory, which began at Chunpich, about {{convert|5|km|mi}} north of the modern border between Mexico and Guatemala.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 130<U+2013>131.<br>ITMB 2000.</ref> He rounded up some natives to be moved into colonial settlements, but met with armed Kejache resistance. A skirmish ensued at a Kejache village, resulting in the deaths of eight Kejache warriors. Prisoners taken during the skirmish informed Garc<U+00ED>a that many independent Maya lived in the area, both Kejache and others. Garc<U+00ED>a decided to retreat around the middle of April, probably to escort captured Kejache back to Sajkab'chen to be put to work on Garc<U+00ED>a's ''encomienda''. Captain Garc<U+00ED>a reported back to Urs<U+00FA>a on 21 April 1695.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 131.</ref>

====D<U+00ED>az de Velasco and Cano's entry from Verapaz, March <U+2013> April 1695====
[[File:San Luis, Pet<U+00E9>n.jpg|thumb|right|alt=View across a wide, shallow valley with scattered buildings interspersed with dense patches of trees, and a number of open, grassy spaces. The valley rises to a low, forested ridgeline. One of the hills supports a tall broadcasting mast.|The modern town of San Luis, founded upon the Mopan capital]]
In March 1695, captain Juan D<U+00ED>az de Velasco set out from [[Cahab<U+00F3>n]] in [[Alta Verapaz]] with 70 Spanish soldiers, accompanied by a large number of Maya archers from Verapaz, and native muleteers; four Dominican friars led by ''Criollo'' friar Agust<U+00ED>n Cano accompanied the expedition.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 132, 134.<br>Means 1917, p. 97.</ref> Theoretically the Spanish soldiers were provided solely as an escort for the Dominicans.<ref name="Jones1999p141"/> The Guatemalan expedition, under orders of President Jacinto de Barrios Leal, were secretly trying to reach the Itzas before Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a could reach them from Yucat<U+00E1>n; the existence of the expedition was carefully concealed during all communications between Guatemala and the governor of Yucat<U+00E1>n.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 133.</ref> It formed a part of a three-pronged attack against the independent inhabitants of Pet<U+00E9>n and neighbouring Chiapas; the other two expeditions were launched against the Lakandon.<ref name="Houwald84p257"/>

The expedition proceeded northwards through Ch'ol territory and into Mopan territory; there they camped at Mopan town (modern [[San Luis, El Pet<U+00E9>n|San Luis]]). Due to their fear of their warlike Itza neighbours, both the Ch'ol and the Mopans claimed not to know of any paths to Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 134.</ref> The Spanish were held up at Mopan for several days by supply problems and desertions amongst their native carriers. The Dominicans took advantage of the delay to proselytise the Mopans and Cano wrote that he had converted four ''[[cacique]]s'' (native chiefs) there, although Taxim Chan, king of the Mopans, had fled with many of the local inhabitants. Cano believed that the Mopans were ruled by the king of the Itzas.<ref name="Jones1998p135">Jones 1998, p. 135.</ref>

=====First skirmish=====
The Spanish believed that by pressing ahead to Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> they would link up with a simultaneous expedition headed by President Barrios himself, unaware that Barrios had not reached the region. D<U+00ED>az de Velasco sent out a scouting party of 50 musketeers accompanied by native archers on 6 April. They soon found evidence of recent Itza camps in the area, estimated to be a month old. The scouts found a clear road heading north to the Itza kingdom, and the army set off along it. The main force camped about ten [[league (unit)|leagues]]{{refn|group=nb|The Spanish ''legua'' unit of measurement was equal to 5000 ''[[Spanish customary units#Vara (unit of length)|varas]]''. This was approximately {{convert|2.6|mi|km}}.<ref>Rowlett 2005.</ref> All distances in this article are based upon this conversion but are subject to often very approximate estimates given in the sources.}} (26&nbsp;miles or 42&nbsp;km) south of the lake, while a smaller scouting party was sent off ahead; this consisted of two Spanish soldiers, two archers and two muleteers from Verapaz, with two Ch'ol-speaking native interpreters. The scouting party advanced to the savannah just to the south of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>, where they encountered about 30 Itza hunters armed with spears, shields and bows, accompanied by hunting dogs. The hunters drew their weapons and prepared to fight, but the Mopan interpreter was instructed to explain that the Spanish party were traders who came in peace, accompanied by missionaries.<ref name="Jones1998p135"/> The Spanish began to suspect that the interpreter was plotting against them with the Itza hunters, and one of the Verapaz archers dragged him out from amongst the hunters.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 135<U+2013>136.</ref> The encounter degenerated into a scuffle, and the Itzas once again drew weapons. The Spanish fired their muskets, fatally wounding two hunters, and a Verapaz Indian charged the Itzas with a machete. The hunters fled, leaving the scouting party in possession of the food and arrows at the hunting camp.<ref name="Jones1998p136">Jones 1998, p. 136.</ref>

=====Second skirmish=====
Five days after this skirmish,<ref name="Jones1998p136"/> Antonio Machuca led a party of 12 musketeers, 25 archers and 13 muleteers to try to find President Barrios, to scout a river route to the lake and to capture another interpreter, the previous one no longer being trusted. The main party arrived on the savannah near the lake. The following night one of the advance party came back into camp with an Itza prisoner, captured after a fierce struggle with the scouts. Interrogation of the prisoner revealed that he was from a high-ranking Itza lineage, and that he had been sent out to find the Spanish party and to see if they came as traders or invaders.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 137<U+2013>138.</ref> The rest of Machuca's scouting party soon returned to the main camp, reporting that they had camped four leagues (approximately 10.4&nbsp;miles or 16.7&nbsp;km) from the lake, where they encountered another hunting party of about "a dozen" Itzas. The Spanish tried to use their interpreter to talk to them but the Itzas responded with a volley of arrows. The Spanish musketeers tried to respond with musketfire, but found their gunpowder too wet to fire properly. The Itza warriors charged upon them with spears, axes and machetes, and the ensuing hand-to-hand battle lasted an hour, during which six of the Itzas were killed; the rest finally retreated. Thanks to their padded cotton armour, the Spanish party received no injuries from the skirmish. The Spanish pursued the fleeing Itzas and another fierce skirmish ensued, lasting another hour during which most of the remaining Itzas were killed.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 139.</ref> Three Itzas escaped, and their leader was rendered unconscious with machete blows to the head; he was taken prisoner and later made a full recovery.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 139<U+2013>140.</ref> Machuca's party reached the lakeshore and could see Nojpet<U+00E9>n across the water, but saw such a large force of Itzas that they retreated south, back to the main camp.<ref name="Jones1999p141">Jones 1998, p. 141.</ref>

An Itza account of this encounter reached the colonial authorities in Yucat<U+00E1>n via Tipuj. The Itza reported that the Guatemalan party approached on horseback to within sight of Nojpet<U+00E9>n, and about thirty curious Itzas gathered to talk to the intruders, whereupon they were attacked by the Spanish, resulting in the deaths of thirty Itzas, the capture of one and yet more wounded. A Christian Maya emissary from Bacalar-at-Chunjujub', Yucat<U+00E1>n, was in Nojpet<U+00E9>n around this time, and reported that the Itza gathered 3,000<U+2013>4,000 warriors ready to repulse D<U+00ED>az de Velasco's party.<ref name="Jones98p171-172"/>

=====Retreat to Guatemala=====
On 24 April, the first prisoner escaped from the main camp; the same day that the injured second prisoner was taken in by Machuca and his men.<ref name="Jones 1998, pp. 140-141">Jones 1998, pp. 140<U+2013>141.</ref> Interrogation of the new prisoner, who turned out to be an Itza nobleman, revealed that the Itza kingdom was in a state of high alert to repel the Spanish.<ref name="Jones1998p140"/> Friar Cano met with his fellow Dominicans to discuss what should be done, having had information from both Machuca and his prisoner that the Itza were ready for war.  The Dominicans were highly critical of the Spanish soldiers' readiness to open fire on poorly armed natives who offered no real threat to them, and suspected that President Barrios was nowhere near the lake; furthermore the Spanish were beginning to succumb to sickness,<ref name="Jones1999p141"/> and the Verapaz Indian recruits were deserting daily. D<U+00ED>az agreed with the Dominicans; two muleteers had already died from sickness, and he recognised that the size of his expedition was not sufficient for a full confrontation with the Itza nation. The expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahab<U+00F3>n.<ref name="Jones1998p142">Jones 1998, p. 142.</ref> The new prisoner, AjK'ixaw was later taken back to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, where the Dominicans questioned him in detail.<ref name="Jones1998p140">Jones 1998, p. 140.</ref> In Guatemala AjK'ixaw learnt Spanish and returned to Pet<U+00E9>n in 1696 as a guide and interpreter for another expedition, before turning on his captors.<ref name="Jones 1998, pp. 140-141"/> After the Spanish retreated to Guatemala, rumours ran rife among the Itza and Kowoj that they would return to engage in wholesale slaughter of the Maya population; large tracts of territory were abandoned in response, including many towns in an area stretching from Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> eastwards to Tipuj and southwards to Mop<U+00E1>n.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 173.</ref>

When captain Garc<U+00ED>a de Paredes unexpectedly returned to Campeche in early May 1695, governor Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a was already preparing reinforcements for his expedition. With Garc<U+00ED>a's arrival, he was immediately allocated the extra soldiers.<ref name="Jones1998p142"/> On 11 May Urs<U+00FA>a ordered Garc<U+00ED>a to begin a second expedition southwards and was allotted 100 salaried Maya to accompany him. These workers were to be paid three pesos per month and received a suspension of their obligations to supply ''encomienda'' work and tribute.<ref name="Jones1998p143"/> Garc<U+00ED>a paid for additional Spanish soldiers from his own funds, as did Jos<U+00E9> Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Estenos, a Campeche resident who was to serve as second-in-command.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 143<U+2013>144.</ref> The final force numbered 115 Spanish soldiers and 150 Maya musketeers, plus Maya labourers and muleteers; the final tally was more than 400 people, which was regarded as a considerable army in the impoverished Yucat<U+00E1>n province.<ref name="Jones1998p143">Jones 1998, p. 143.</ref> Urs<U+00FA>a also ordered two companies of Maya musketeers from [[Tekax|Tek'ax]] and Oxk'utzkab' to join the expedition at B'olonch'en Kawich, some {{convert|60|km|mi}} southeast of the city of Campeche.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 130, 144.</ref> Bonifacio Us was captain of the Tek'ax company; Diego Uk was that of the Oxk'utzkab' company. Marcos Pot was overall "cacique captain" of these two Maya companies; all three officers were Maya. A Maya company from Sajkab'chen served as elite musketeers charged with rounding up forest Maya into the ''reducciones''; this company was excused from heavy labour duties. Non-Maya soldiers were a mix of Spanish, [[mestizo]]s (mixed race Spanish and native) and [[mulatto]]s (mixed race Spanish and black).<ref name="Jones1998p144">Jones 1998, p. 144.</ref>

On 18 May Urs<U+00FA>a requested three missionaries to support the expedition from the Francisan [[provincial superior]], friar Antonio de Silva; by 30 May three friars were ready to join the Spanish force, accompanied by a lay brother who had not yet taken vows. In addition, Silva sent another group of Franciscans led by friar Andr<U+00E9>s de Avenda<U+00F1>o, who was accompanied by another friar and a lay brother.<ref name="Jones 1998 148">Jones 1998, p. 148.</ref> This second group was only to remain with Garc<U+00ED>a while convenient for them to do so, and were to continue onwards independently to Nojpet<U+00E9>n to make contact with the Itzas, with the tacit approval of Urs<U+00FA>a.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 148<U+2013>149.</ref> In fact Avenda<U+00F1>o and his party left M<U+00E9>rida on 2 June, a week before the party assigned to Garc<U+00ED>a.<ref name="Jones1998p149">Jones 1998, p. 149.</ref> On 23 June Urs<U+00FA>a received a message informing him of the occupation of Sakb'ajlan (Dolores del Lakandon) by Guatemalan troops.<ref name="Jones1998p144"/> By this time Garc<U+00ED>a was at Tzuktok', near the Kejache border.<ref name="Jones1998p145">Jones 1998, p. 145.</ref> Although Urs<U+00FA>a's purported plan, as authorised by the Spanish crown, was to build a road uniting Yucat<U+00E1>n with Guatemala, he now realised that he was in a race to conquer the Itza kingdom; President Barrios of Guatemala had reached Sakb'ajlan and was returning to Santiago to prepare another expedition, and Guatemalan soldiers had already reached the lakeshore of Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>. Any linking road to Dolores del Lakandon would have passed through sparsely inhabited territory; instead the Yucatecan surveyor plotted a route due south directly to the lake where it could connect with the south road via Cahab<U+00F3>n in Verapaz. This route would leave Dolores del Lakandon and the Lakandon Ch'ol isolated to the west.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 132<U+2013>133, 145.</ref> Urs<U+00FA>a issued new orders to Garc<U+00ED>a dissimulating his desire to conquer the Itza. His letter ordered Garc<U+00ED>a to link up with President Barrios at Dolores del Lakandon while giving him a precise route that would take him instead to the lake.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 145<U+2013>146.</ref> A short time after receiving these orders, Garc<U+00ED>a ordered the construction of a fort at Chuntuki, some 25 leagues (approximately 65&nbsp;miles or 105&nbsp;km) north of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>. This would serve as the main military base for the ''Camino Real'' ("Royal Road") project;<ref name="Jones1998p147">Jones 1998, p. 147.</ref> the supply base was at Kawich, under the command of Juan del Castillo y Arru<U+00E9>.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 144, 147.</ref> On 27 July Urs<U+00FA>a authorised the creation of three new militia companies of 25 men apiece to reinforce Garc<U+00ED>a.

=====Skirmish at Chunpich=====
The Sajkab'chen company of native musketeers pushed ahead with the road builders from Tzuktzok' to the first Kejache town at Chunpich, which the Kejache had fled, leaving behind a substantial amount of food. The company's officers sent for reinforcements from Garc<U+00ED>a at Tzuktok' but before any could arrive some 25 Kejache returned to Chunpich with baskets to collect their abandoned food. The nervous Sajkab'chen sentries feared that the residents were returning en masse and discharged their muskets at them, with both groups then retreating. The musketeer company then arrived to reinforce their sentries and charged into battle against approaching Kejache archers. Several musketeers were injured in the ensuing skirmish and, the Kejache retreated along a forest path without injury, mocking the invaders. The Sajkab'chen company followed the path and found two more deserted settlements with large amounts of abandoned food. They seized the food and retreated back along the path.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 154.<br>Means 1917, pp. 117<U+2013>118.</ref>

=====Reinforcements=====
Around 3 August Garc<U+00ED>a moved his entire army forward to Chunpich,<ref name="Jones1998p154">Jones 1998, p. 154.</ref> and by October Spanish soldiers had established themselves near the source of the [[San Pedro River (Guatemala)|San Pedro River]].<ref name="Jones98p163">Jones 1998, p. 163.</ref> By November Tzuktok' was garrisoned with 86 soldiers and more at Chuntuki; in that month Garc<U+00ED>a once again returned to Campeche. By December 1695 Urs<U+00FA>a was under pressure to complete the conquest of the Itza, and he approved the despatch of reinforcements along the ''Camino Real'' to join the main garrison. The reinforcements included 150 Spanish and pardo soldiers and 100 Maya soldiers, together with labourers and muleteers.<ref name="Jones 1998, p. 162">Jones 1998, p. 162.</ref> An advance group of 150 mixed Maya and non-Maya soldiers met up with Garc<U+00ED>a at Campeche and proceeded southwards along the ''Camino Real''  towards the San Pedro River. The rest of the reinforcements did not leave Campeche until March 1696.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 162<U+2013>163.</ref>

====Avenda<U+00F1>o's entry from Yucat<U+00E1>n, June 1695====
In May 1695 Antonio de Silva had appointed two groups of Franciscans to head for Pet<U+00E9>n; the first group was to join up with Garc<U+00ED>a's military expedition. The second group was to head for Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itza independently. This second group was headed by friar Andr<U+00E9>s de Avenda<U+00F1>o. Avenda<U+00F1>o was accompanied by friar Antonio P<U+00E9>rez de San Rom<U+00E1>n, lay brother Alonso de Vargas and six Maya Christians recruited from M<U+00E9>rida and towns en route to Campeche.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 148, 150.</ref> This latter group left M<U+00E9>rida on 2 June 1695 and made its way to Juan del Castillo y Arru<U+00E9>'s supply base at Kawich, set up to support Garc<U+00ED>a's military expedition.<ref>Jones 1998 pp. 149<U+2013>150</ref> On 24 June Avenda<U+00F1>o's party left Kawich and set off across sparsely inhabited territory.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 150.</ref> On 29 June they arrived at an abandoned Maya temples, which he referred to by the name Nojku, meaning "Big Temple". The Spanish had already passed through and had broken many "idols" but the friars climbed the temple and managed to find about 50 additional ceremonial sculptures, which they destroyed; they also placed a cross inside. The other group of friars, on their way to join Garc<U+00ED>a, passed through Nojku a few days later and found that local Maya had already placed new offerings within.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 151.</ref> Avenda<U+00F1>o's group continued southwards and found increasing signs of habitation and arrived at the military camp of captain Jos<U+00E9> Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Estenos at the deserted Maya town of Nojt'ub', which had been cleared by the Spanish under Garc<U+00ED>a some sixteen years previously.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 130, 151<U+2013>152.</ref>

Avenda<U+00F1>o continued south along the course of the new road, finding increasing evidence of Spanish military activity, with the rounding up of local inhabitants and raiding of fields and orchards for provisions by Spanish troops. The Franciscans overtook Garc<U+00ED>a at B'uk'te, about {{convert|12|km|mi}} before Tzuktok'.<ref name="Jones1998p152"/> Avenda<U+00F1>o's party arrived at Tzuktok', near the Kejache border, by 10 July and left two weeks later, around the same time that Garc<U+00ED>a arrived there with his captives rounded up at B'uk'te for forced labour. Before leaving, the Franciscans protested to Garc<U+00ED>a and his officers about the poor treatment of the local inhabitants; the officers promised better treatment of the Maya in future.<ref name="Jones1998p153">Jones 1998, p. 153.</ref> On 3 August Garc<U+00ED>a advanced to Chunpich but tried to persuade Avenda<U+00F1>o to stay behind to minister to the prisoners from B'uk'te. Avenda<U+00F1>o instead split his group and left in secret with just four Christian Maya companions,<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 150, 154.</ref> seeking the Chunpich Kejache that had attacked one of Garc<U+00ED>a's advance companies and had now retreated into the forest.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 154<U+2013>155.</ref> He was unable to find the Kejache but did manage to get information regarding a path that led southwards to the Itza kingdom. He met four exhausted Sajkab'chen musketeers who were carrying a letter addressed to him from captain Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Estenos. This letter explained that further south there were various deserted Maya towns with only rotten maize abandoned by their occupiers. Avenda<U+00F1>o returned to Tzuktok' and reconsidered his plans; the Franciscans were short of supplies, and the forcefully congregated Maya that they were charged with converting were disappearing back into the forest daily. Additionally, the Spanish officers ignored the concerns of the friars and Garc<U+00ED>a was abducting local Maya women and children to be taken back to his ''encomienda'' for forced labour.<ref>Jones 1998, p.  155.</ref> The Franciscans set upon a different, ultimately unsuccessful, plan; they would follow the road back north to Jop'elch'en near Campeche city and attempt to reach the Itza via Tipuj.<ref>Jones 1998, pp.  130, 155<U+2013>156.</ref> This route was blocked when the [[secular clergy]] prevented the Franciscans from attempting it. Antonio de Silva ordered Avenda<U+00F1>o to return to M<U+00E9>rida, and he arrived there on 17 September 1695.<ref>Jones 1998, p.  156.</ref> Meanwhile the other group of Franciscans, led by Juan de San Buenaventura Ch<U+00E1>vez, continued following the roadbuilders into Kejache territory, through IxB'am, B'atkab' and Chuntuki (modern Chuntunqui near [[Carmelita, Pet<U+00E9>n]]).<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 148, 157.<br>Quezada 2011, p. 23.<br>ITMB 1998.</ref>

====San Buenaventura among the Kejache, September <U+2013> November 1695====

Juan de San Buenaventura's small group of Franciscans had arrived in Chuntuki on 30 August 1695, and found that the army had opened the road southwards for another seventeen leagues (approximately 44.2&nbsp;miles or 71.1&nbsp;km), almost half way to Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>, but returned to Chuntuki due to the seasonal rains.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 157.</ref> San Buenaventura was accompanied by friar Joseph de Jes<U+00FA>s Mar<U+00ED>a, lay friar Tom<U+00E1>s de Alcoser and lay brother Lucas de San Francisco.<ref name="Jones 1998 148"/> With Avenda<U+00F1>o's return to M<U+00E9>rida, provincial superior Antonio de Silva despatched two additional friars to join San Buenaventura's group: Diego de Echevarr<U+00ED>a and Diego de Salas. One of these was to convert the Kejache in Tzuktok', and the other was to do the same at Chuntuki. Although initially reluctant to permit the group to continue into Itza territory, by late October Garc<U+00ED>a de Paredes had relented and acquiesced to de Silva's instructions for San Buenaventura and his original companions to continue to Nojpet<U+00E9>n,<ref>Jones 1998, p. 158.</ref> although it appears that this never happened.<ref name="Jones 1998, p. 162"/>  On 24 October San Buenaventura wrote to the provincial superior reporting that the warlike Kejache were now pacified and that they had told him that the Itza were ready to receive the Spanish in friendship.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 158<U+2013>159.</ref> On that day 62 Kejache men had voluntarily come to Chuntuki from Pak'ek'em, where another 300 Kejache resided. San Buenaventura sent lay brother Lucas de San Francisco to convince them to relocate to the Chuntuki mission. Lucas de San Francisco destroyed the idols in Pak'ek'em but the inhabitants were not brought to the mission because of worries about feeding the new arrivals.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 159<U+2013>160.</ref> Instead, in early November 1695, friar Tom<U+00E1>s de Alcoser and brother Lucas de San Francisco were sent to establish a mission at Pak'ek'em, where they were well received by the cacique and his pagan priest. Pak'ek'em was sufficiently far from the new Spanish road that it was free from military interference, and the friars oversaw the building of a church in what was the largest mission town in Kejache territory. A second church was built at B'atkab' to attend to over 100 K'ejache refugees who had been gathered there under the stewardship of friar Diego de Echevarr<U+00ED>a;<ref>Jones 1998, p. 160.</ref> a further church was established at Tzuktok', overseen by Diego de Salas.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 160<U+2013>161.</ref>

====Avenda<U+00F1>o's entry from Yucat<U+00E1>n, December 1695 <U+2013> January 1696====
Franciscan Andr<U+00E9>s de Avenda<U+00F1>o left M<U+00E9>rida on 13 December 1695, and arrived in Nojpet<U+00E9>n around 14 January 1696;<ref>Jones 1998, p. 187.</ref> he followed the new road as far as possible then continued towards Nojpet<U+00E9>n with local Maya guides.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 774<U+2013>775.</ref> He was accompanied by friars Antonio P<U+00E9>rez de San Rom<U+00E1>n, Joseph de Jes<U+00FA>s Mar<U+00ED>a and Deigo de Echevarr<U+00ED>a, and by lay brother Lucas de San Francisco; some of these he collected on his journey south along the ''Camino Real''. On 5 January they caught up with and passed the main contingent of the army at B'atkab', continuing to Chuntuki.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 189.</ref> From Chuntuki they followed an Indian trail that led them past the source of the San Pedro River and across steep karst hills to a watering hole by some ruins, which was recorded as Tanxulukmul by Avenda<U+00F1>o.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 189<U+2013>190.<br>Means 1917, p. 128.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Tanxulukmul was also the name of an Itza refuge recorded in the ''[[Chilam Balam|Book of Chilam B'alam of Chumayel]]''. This was probably the same place, and has been tentatively identified as the ruins of [[Motul de San Jos<U+00E9>#Akte|Akte]], near the large Classic period site of [[Motul de San Jos<U+00E9>]], {{convert|3|km|mi}} from the north shore of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itza.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 190, 471n15.<br>Foias 2000, p. 773.</ref>}} From Tanxulukmul they followed the small Act<U+00E9> River to a Chak'an Itza town called Saklemakal.<ref name="Jones98p190">Jones 1998, p. 190.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|This Saklemahal can probably be identified with the ruins of [[Motul de San Jos<U+00E9>#Kantetul|Kantetul]], {{convert|2|km|mi}} north of Motul de San Jos<U+00E9>.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 190.<br>Emery 2003, p. 34.</ref>}} They arrived at the western end of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> to an enthusiastic welcome by the local Itza.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p775"/>

Unknown to the Franciscans, the northern Chak'an Itza province of the Itza kingdom was allied with the Kowoj and was at war with the Itza king. The Chak'an Itzas carried off most of the gifts that the Spanish party had brought for the Itza king, in an effort to hinder friendly relations developing.<ref name="Jones98p190"/>  The following day, the current Aj Kan Ek' travelled across the lake with eighty canoes to greet the visitors at the Chak'an Itza port town of Nich, on the west shore of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itza.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 775.<br>Jones 1998, p. 192.</ref> The Franciscans returned to Nojpet<U+00E9>n with Kan Ek' and baptised over 300 Itza children over the following four days. Avenda<U+00F1>o tried to convince Kan Ek' to convert to Christianity and surrender to the Spanish crown, without success.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p775"/> The Franciscan friar tried to convince the Itza king that the K'atun 8 Ajaw, a twenty-year [[Maya calendar|Maya calendrical cycle]] beginning in 1696 or 1697, was the right time for the Itza to finally embrace Christianity and to accept the king of Spain as overlord.<ref name="Jones00p362"/> The king of the Itza, like his forebear, cited Itza prophecy and said the time was not yet right. He asked the Spanish to return in four months, at which time the Itza would convert and swear fealty to the King of Spain.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p775">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 775.</ref>

On 19 January AjKowoj, the king of the Kowoj, arrived at Nojpet<U+00E9>n and spoke with Avenda<U+00F1>o,<ref>Jones 1998, p. 205.</ref> arguing against the acceptance of Christianity and Spanish rule.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 207.</ref> The discussions between Avenda<U+00F1>o, Kan Ek' and AjKowoj exposed deep divisions among the Itza <U+2013> and the apparent treachery of the Itza king in offering his kingdom to the Spanish undermined Kan Ek's power over his own people.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 209<U+2013>210.</ref> Kan Ek' learnt of a plot by the Kowoj and their Chak'an Itza allies to ambush and kill the Franciscans, and the Itza king advised them to return to M<U+00E9>rida via Tipuj.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 775.<br>Jones 1998, pp. 214<U+2013>215.</ref> The Itza king's efforts to save his Spanish guests effectively ended his power to rule; from that point on anti-Spanish sentiment governed Itza responses to the Spanish.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 216.</ref> The Franciscans were guided to Yalain where they were well received but while they were there the Yalain heard rumours of battle and a Spanish advance towards Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 216<U+2013>217.</ref> The Franciscans were shown a path that lead to Tipuj but their Yalain guides soon abandoned them.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 217<U+2013>218.</ref> The Spanish friars became lost and suffered great hardships, including the death of one of Avenda<U+00F1>o's companions,<ref>Vayhinger-Scheer 2006, 2011, p. 383.</ref> but after a month wandering in the forest found their way back to Chuntuki and from there made their way back to M<U+00E9>rida.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 775<U+2013>776.<br>Jones 1998, pp. 218<U+2013>219.</ref>

====Battle at Ch'ich', 2 February 1696====
Kan Ek' had sent emissaries to M<U+00E9>rida in December 1695 to inform Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a that the Itza would peacefully submit to Spanish rule.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p776"/> By mid-January captain Garc<U+00ED>a de Paredes had advanced from B'atkab' to the advance portion of the ''Camino Real'' at Chuntuki.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 189, 226.</ref> By now he only had 90 soldiers plus labourers and porters, with many of his soldiers deserting as the force advanced towards Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>; they were further delayed by the necessity of building an oar-powered longboat (or ''[[Pirogue|piragua]]'') to cross the San Pedro River.<ref name="Jones98p226">Jones 1998, p. 226.</ref> Soon after Avenda<U+00F1>o's flight eastward from Nojpet<U+00E9>n, a group of 60 Maya warriors entered Chuntuki in full warpaint and bearing weapons; they claimed to have been sent by Avenda<U+00F1>o to collect religious regalia and another friar. This was not the case, and they were almost certainly a scouting party sent by the Kowoj and their Chak'an Itza allies to see what progress the Spanish army was making along the road.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 226<U+2013>227.</ref> They spoke with Garc<U+00ED>a and then rapidly departed without taking any of the items that they had supposedly been sent to collect.<ref name="Jones98p226"/> Garc<U+00ED>a despatched two Kejache scouts to the lakeshore to discover Avenda<U+00F1>o's whereabouts; at the same time Avenda<U+00F1>o's Kejache guides were returning to Chuntuki from Nojpet<U+00E9>n with news of Avenda<U+00F1>o's flight.<ref name="Jones98p227">Jones 1998, p. 227.</ref> The Itzas at the lake handed over an open letter written by Avenda<U+00F1>o before his departure from Nojpet<U+00E9>n as a token of friendship between the Itza and the Spanish.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 211<U+2013>212, 227.</ref> Friar Juan de San Buenaventura was enthused by the letter and wished to travel on to Nojpet<U+00E9>n himself.<ref name="Jones98p227"/>

Garc<U+00ED>a sent captain Pedro de Zubiaur, his senior officer, on towards the lake. He arrived at Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itza with 60 musketeers, friar San Buenaventura and another Franciscan and allied Yucatec Maya warriors.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 227.<br>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 776.</ref> They were also accompanied by about 40 Maya porters. On 2 February the expedition was approached by two Itza warriors who told them of a recent battle between a Guatemalan expedition and the Itza;<ref name="Jones98p227"/> these two Itzas guided the party to a nearby Itza settlement, and the letter from Avenda<U+00F1>o was shown to captain Zubiaur, convincing him that he could advance safely.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 227<U+2013>228.</ref> The port town of Ch'ich' was abandoned but a large number of canoes approached, judged to be as many as 300 by the Spanish captain, bearing perhaps 2,000 Itza warriors.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 228.<br>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 776.</ref> The warriors began to mingle freely with the Spanish party and began to load the Spanish supplies into the canoes with a promise of transporting the expedition across to Nojpet<U+00E9>n, with one soldier in each canoe. The Franciscans readily boarded the canoes, with two soldiers as an escort. A scuffle then broke out; a dozen more of the Spanish party were forced into canoes, and two porters were beaten to death. One of the captured Spanish soldiers was immediately decapitated. At this point the Spanish soldiers opened fire with their muskets, and the Itza retreated across the lake with their prisoners.<ref name="Jones98p228">Jones 1998, p. 228.</ref>

The Spanish party retreated from the lake shore and regrouped on open ground where they were surrounded by about 2,000 Itza warriors who attempted to disarm them; the Itzas managed to seize another Spaniard and immediately struck off his head. At this point about 10,000 Itza archers appeared from canoes concealed among the lakeside mangroves, and Zubiaur ordered his men to fire a volley that killed between 30 and 40 Itzas. Realising that they were hopelessly outnumbered, the Spanish retreated towards Chuntuki, abandoning their captured companions to their fate.<ref name="Jones98p229">Jones 1998, p. 229.</ref> A Christian Maya musketeer and six other Indians fled at the start of the battle and took news to Garc<U+00ED>a that the entire expedition had been slaughtered;<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 227, 229.</ref> however Zabiaur and the survivors of his expedition marched back into the base camp at Chuntuki two days later.<ref name="Jones98p229"/> Urs<U+00FA>a later reported that the Spanish prisoners were taken back to Nojpet<U+00E9>n where they were all killed; this was also confirmed by AjChan at a later date. The bones of the dead were said to have been found by the Spanish after the final assault on Nojpet<U+00E9>n in 1697;<ref name="Jones98p230">Jones 1998, p. 230.</ref> AjK'in Kan Ek', the Itza high priest, later reported that he had bound San Buenaventura and his companion into cross shapes and cut out their hearts.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 303.</ref>

This turn of events convinced Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a that Kan Ek' would not surrender peacefully, and he began to organise an all-out assault on Nojpet<U+00E9>n.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p776">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 776.</ref> The enlistment of previously authorised reinforcements was now urgent, but was hindered when 70 of 100 soldiers mutinied and never reached Garc<U+00ED>a's camp.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 229<U+2013>230.</ref> Work on the road was redoubled and about a month after the battle at Ch'ich' the Spanish arrived at the lakeshore, now supported by artillery. Again a large number of canoes gathered, and the nervous Spanish soldiers opened fire with cannons and muskets; no casualties were reported among the Itza, who retreated and raised a white flag from a safe distance.<ref name="Jones98p229"/>

====Am<U+00E9>squeta's entry from Verapaz, February <U+2013> March 1696====
The Guatemalan authorities were unaware of ongoing contacts between the colonial authorities in Yucat<U+00E1>n and the Itza. In the second half of 1695 President Barrios began planning another expedition against the Itza from Verapaz, following harsh criticism of Juan D<U+00ED>az de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> in April of that year.<ref name="Jones 1998, p. 232"/> Barrios died in November, and ''[[oidor]]'' Jos<U+00E9> de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed ''oidor'' Bartolom<U+00E9> de Am<U+00E9>squeta to lead the next expedition against the Itza.<ref name="Jones 1998, p. 233">Jones 1998, p. 233.</ref> Am<U+00E9>squeta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahab<U+00F3>n to Mop<U+00E1>n, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between Garc<U+00ED>a's forces and the Itza. Am<U+00E9>squeta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mop<U+00E1>n.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 232<U+2013>233.</ref> Captain D<U+00ED>az de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Crist<U+00F3>bal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjK'ixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on D<U+00ED>az's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator. They set out from Mop<U+00E1>n on 7 March and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days, they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at R<U+00ED>o Chakal. The two forces combined, giving D<U+00ED>az a force of 49 soldiers and 34 porters and archers from Verapaz.<ref name="Jones 1998, p. 233"/> Once they arrived at IxB'ol, near the shore of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>, AjK'ixaw was sent ahead as an emissary to Nojpet<U+00E9>n.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 233<U+2013>234.</ref>

=====Am<U+00E9>squeta's attempt to locate D<U+00ED>az de Velasco=====
Back in Mop<U+00E1>n, Am<U+00E9>squeta had received additional supplies and decided to catch up with his advance party. He left Mop<U+00E1>n on 10 March 1696 with friar Agust<U+00ED>n Cano and about 10 soldiers. He arrived at Chakal a week later but there was still no word from D<U+00ED>az or AjK'ixaw. On 20 March Am<U+00E9>squeta left Chakal with 36 men and four days' supplies to find D<U+00ED>az's party, whom he assumed would be nearby. After two days travelling in intense heat they met up with some Verapaz porters that D<U+00ED>az had left behind. They followed D<U+00ED>az's trail to the shore of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> near to the Itza capital. As they scouted along the south shore they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes,<ref>Jones 1998, p. 234.</ref> and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance. There were plentiful signs that D<U+00ED>az's party had passed that way, and Am<U+00E9>squeta assumed that they had crossed to Nojpet<U+00E9>n. He wrote a letter to D<U+00ED>az, which was passed to an Itza onlooker who indicated he would deliver it. Various Itzas now approached the party, including a nobleman who exchanged gifts with Am<U+00E9>squeta.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 235.</ref> During various attempts at communication to verify D<U+00ED>az's whereabouts the Itza became agitated and responded angrily, although no-one in the Spanish party could understand the Itza language. The Itzas indicated that the Spanish should proceed to the lakeshore along a narrow path and embark in the small canoes that were stationed nearby. One of Am<U+00E9>squeta's officers recognised an Indian among the Itzas as a Mopan who had served as a soldier in D<U+00ED>az's first expedition and thought that the Mopan was trying to tell him not to trust the Itzas.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 236.</ref>

Am<U+00E9>squeta was extremely suspicious of the small canoes being supplied, knowing that the Itza had 30-man canoes; he was also aware that tricking enemies into small canoes was a favoured tactic among the lowland Maya to separate and kill Spanish intruders. He suspected that AjK'ixaw had betrayed them and that this was precisely what had happened to D<U+00ED>az and his men.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 237.</ref> As nightfall approached, low on rations, in a vulnerable location and with no sign of D<U+00ED>az and his men, Am<U+00E9>squeta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 237<U+2013>238.</ref> In the early hours of the morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight, using just a few torches.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 238<U+2013>239.</ref> They arrived back at Chakal on 25 March and from there retreated to San Pedro M<U+00E1>rtir on 9 April, beset by worsening conditions, a hurricane, sickness and rumours of enemies.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 239<U+2013>240.</ref> The battered expedition set up a base camp nine leagues (approximately 23.4&nbsp;miles or 37.7&nbsp;km) north of Mopan.<ref name="Jones98p240"/>

=====Fate of D<U+00ED>az de Velasco's expedition=====
Writing after the fall of Nojpet<U+00E9>n, friar Cano described the ultimate fate of D<U+00ED>az de Velasco and his companions; he claimed to have received the information from interviews with the soldiers from Yucat<U+00E1>n who had stormed the Itza capital and from Ch'ol witnesses, although there were no Ch'ol at Nojpet<U+00E9>n. D<U+00ED>az's party arrived at the lakeshore and were told by local Itza that Franciscan friars were at Nojpet<U+00E9>n. They were wary at first and asked for proof, upon which an Itza messenger brought them a [[rosary]] as a token. Looking across the lake they saw men dressed as friars calling to them to come across, these were Itza dressed in the habits of the two Franciscans who had recently been killed at the island. D<U+00ED>az and his companions then boarded the Itza canoes, leaving thirty Maya porters with their mules and supplies.<ref name="Jones 1998, p479n59."/>

Once on the lake the Itza overturned some of the canoes and killed some of D<U+00ED>az's men; others were wounded and dragged ashore to be killed. D<U+00ED>az, the Dominicans and two other men were in a large canoe that was not overturned and were taken to Nojpet<U+00E9>n where a fierce struggle ensued as D<U+00ED>az attempted to defend himself with his sword, killing a number of Itzas. The two other men were immediately killed while the friars were beaten and tied to X-shaped crosses before having their hearts cut out. Across the lake, the Itza attacked the porters guarding the expedition supplies and killed them to a man. The Itza killed a total of 87 expedition members, including 50 soldiers, two Dominicans and about 35 Maya helpers. The remains of the small group that were killed on Nojpet<U+00E9>n were later retrieved by the Spanish after the fall of the city and were taken back to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala for burial.<ref name="Jones 1998, p479n59.">Jones 1998, p. 479n59.</ref>

=====Aftermath of Am<U+00E9>squeta's entry=====
Over the following weeks scouts were sent out to try to make contact with local Mopan and Ch'ol communities, including Chok Ajaw, AjMay, IxB'ol and Manche without success <U+2013> most of the natives had fled, leaving the forest deserted. At San Pedro Mart<U+00ED>r he received news of AjChan's embassy to M<U+00E9>rida in December 1695 and the formal surrender of the Itza to Spanish authority.<ref name="Jones98p240">Jones 1998, p. 240.</ref> Unable to reconcile the news with the loss of his men at Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>, and with appalling conditions in San Pedro M<U+00E1>rtir, Am<U+00E9>squeta abandoned the unfinished fort.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 241<U+2013>242.</ref> Friar Cano recommended to the new Guatemalan president that the Ch'ol be moved to Verapaz where they could be properly administered. As a result of the failed expedition, Cano's recommendation was accepted, the fort was dismantled and any Maya that could be captured across a wide swathe of southern Pet<U+00E9>n was forcibly relocated to Bel<U+00E9>n near Rabinal in Verapaz. This relocation was brutal and ruthless and was condemned by several high-ranking colonial officials, including ''oidor'' Jos<U+00E9> de Escals and even by Am<U+00E9>squeta.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 242<U+2013>243.</ref>

===Fall of Nojpet<U+00E9>n===
[[File:Lake Peten Itza at conquest 1697.gif|thumb|right|400px|alt=Map showing Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> extending east-west. Two smaller lakes lie a short distance to the east, first Lake Salpet<U+00E9>n and then Lake Macanch<U+00E9>. The town of Yalain is on the north shore of Lake Macanch<U+00E9>; Zacpet<U+00E9>n is on the north shore of Lake Salpet<U+00E9>n. Ixl<U+00FA> is on the east shore of the main lake, Uspet<U+00E9>n is on its north shore. Chakok'ot and Chak'an are on the northwest shore, Ch'ich' is on a small peninsula on the southwest side of the lake. Nojpet<U+00E9>n is on an island in an extension of the lake branching southeast. Beyond this branch are two small lakes, Petenxil and Eckixil. The {{lang|es|Camino Real}} route to Guatemala extends south from the south shore opposite Nojpet<U+00E9>n. The {{lang|es|Camino Real}} route to Yucat<U+00E1>n runs north around the west shore of the lake from Ch'ich' to Chak'an and then heads north away from the lake to Tanxulukmul and onwards. Kantetul is a short way to the east of Tanxulukmul. The Itza territory covered the almost the entire western half of the lake and extended further westwards, it also included the two small lakes extending from the southern branch of the lake. The area south of the main lake was Itza-dominated. The Kowoj territory covered the area northeast of the lake, and the easternmost portion of the south shore. It extended around Lake Zacpet<U+00E9>n. Yalain territory surrounded the small Macanch<U+00E9> lake.|Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itza at the time of the conquest]]
The Itzas' continued resistance had become a major embarrassment for the Spanish colonial authorities, and soldiers were despatched from Campeche to take Nojpet<U+00E9>n once and for all.<ref name="Jones00p362">Jones 2000, p. 362.</ref> The final assault was made possible by the gradual opening of a road from M<U+00E9>rida to Pet<U+00E9>n;<ref name="Fialko03p72">Fialko Coxemans 2003, p. 72.</ref> by December 1696 this road had reached the lake shore although it was unfinished and still almost impassable in places.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 249.</ref> By this time the deep divisions between the political leaders of the Itza were such that a unified defence of the Itza kingdom had become impossible.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 245<U+2013>246.</ref>

====Final preparations====
In late December 1696 the Chak'an Itza attacked the large Kejache mission town of Pak'ek'em; they abducted almost all the inhabitants and burned the church. The demoralised Spanish garrison at Chuntuki buried their weapons and ammunition and retreated five leagues (approximately 13&nbsp;miles or 21&nbsp;km) back towards Campeche.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 253, 256.</ref> From late December 1696 to the middle of January 1697 Urs<U+00FA>a sent a number of parties of soldiers and workmen along the road towards the lake; the first group was commanded by Pedro de Zubiaur and had instructions to begin building a ''[[Galiot|galeota]]'', a large oar-powered warship.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. xxvi, 252<U+2013>253, 265.</ref> This group was followed by reinforcements bringing supplies, including light and heavy weapons, gunpowder and food. On 23 January Urs<U+00FA>a left Campeche with more soldiers and muleteers, bringing the total number of soldiers arriving as reinforcements to 130.<ref name="Jones98p253">Jones 1998, p. 253.</ref> The Spanish fortified their positions at Ch'ich' and deployed heavy artillery for its defence.<ref name="Jones98p267">Jones 1998, p. 267.</ref>

Mart<U+00ED>n de Urz<U+00FA>a y Arizmendi arrived on the western shore of lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> with his soldiers on 26 February 1697, and once there built the heavily-armed ''galeota'' attack boat, which was assembled at Ch'ich' over a space of 12 days in early March.<ref>Jones 2009, p. 59.<br>Jones 1998, pp. 253, 265<U+2013>266.</ref> The ''galeota'' had a [[keel]] of 30 cubits or {{convert|14.4|m|ft}}; it had 12 oars on each side and a rudder with an iron screw. The ''galeota'' carried 114 men and at least five artillery pieces, including a ''pieza'' (light cannon) and four ''pedreros'' (mortars).<ref name="Jones  1998 268 269"/> The ''piragua'' longboat used to cross the San Pedro River was also transported to the lake to be used in the attack on the Itza capital; this boat had 6 oars and a rudder.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 252, 268.</ref>

From 28 February onwards the Spanish expedition was repeatedly approached by hostile Itzas, who sometimes shot arrows in the direction of the intruders but inflicted no casualties.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 266<U+2013>267.</ref> At the same time, small groups of curious Itzas mingled freely with the Spanish and received trinkets from them such as belts, necklaces and earrings.<ref name="Jones98p267"/>

====Assault on Nojpet<U+00E9>n====
On 10 March a number of Itza and Yalain emissaries arrived at Ch'ich' to negotiate with Urs<U+00FA>a; first came AjChan who had already met him in M<U+00E9>rida; he was followed by Chamach Xulu, the ruler of the Yalain.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 269<U+2013>270.</ref> Kan Ek' then sent a canoe with a white flag raised bearing emissaries, including the Itza high priest, who offered peaceful surrender. Urs<U+00FA>a received the embassy in peace and invited Kan Ek' to visit his encampment three days later. On the appointed day Kan Ek' failed to arrive; instead Maya warriors amassed both along the shore and in canoes upon the lake.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p777">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 777.</ref>

Urs<U+00FA>a decided that any further attempts at peaceful incorporation of the Itza into the Spanish Empire were pointless, and a waterbourne assault was launched upon Kan Ek's capital on the morning of 13 March.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 777.<br>Jones 1998, p. 295.</ref> The encampment at Ch'ich' was left defended by 25 Spanish soldiers, three Maya musketeers and several artillery pieces.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 296<U+2013>297.</ref> Urs<U+00FA>a boarded the ''galeota'' with 108 soldiers, two secular priests, five personal servants, the baptised Itza emissary AjChan and his brother-in-law and an Itza prisoner from Nojpet<U+00E9>n. The attack boat was rowed east from Ch'ich' towards the Itza capital; half way across the lake it encountered a large fleet of canoes spread in an arc across the approach to Nojpet<U+00E9>n, covering about {{convert|600|m|ft}} from one shore to another <U+2013> Urs<U+00FA>a simply gave the order to row through them. A large quantity of defenders had gathered along the shore of Nojpet<U+00E9>n and on the roofs of the city. As the ''galeota'' approached, more canoes put out from the shore and the Spanish were surrounded.<ref name="Jones98p297">Jones 1998, p. 297.</ref> Once they had surrounded the ''galeota'', Itza archers began to shoot at the invaders. Urs<U+00FA>a gave orders to his men not to fire but arrows wounded a number of the soldiers; one of the wounded soldiers discharged his musket and at that point the officers lost control of their men. The defending Itza soon fled from the withering Spanish gunfire.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 298<U+2013>299.</ref>

The city fell after a brief but bloody battle in which many Itza warriors died; the Spanish suffered only minor casualties. The Spanish bombardment caused heavy loss of life on the island;<ref name="Jones09p59" /> the surviving Itza abandoned their capital and swam across to the mainland with many dying in the water.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 777<U+2013>778.</ref> After the battle the surviving defenders melted away into the forests, leaving the Spanish to occupy an abandoned Maya town.<ref name="Jones00p362" /> Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a planted his standard upon the highest point of the island and renamed Nojpet<U+00E9>n as ''Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza'' ("Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul, Lake of the Itza").<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 778.<br>Jones 2009, p. 59.</ref> The Itza nobility fled, dispersing to Maya settlements throughout Pet<U+00E9>n; in response the Spanish scoured the region with search parties.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 295.</ref> Kan Ek' was soon captured with help from the Yalain Maya ruler Chamach Xulu;<ref name="Jones 1998, p. 306">Jones 1998, p. 306.</ref> The Kowoj king (Aj Kowoj) was also soon captured, together with other Maya nobles and their families.<ref name="Jones09p59">Jones 2009, p. 59.</ref> With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the Americas fell to the European colonisers.<ref name="Jones98pxix">Jones 1998, p. xix.</ref>

====Aftermath====
Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a had little interest in administering the newly conquered territory and delegated its control to military officers who he did very little to support, either militarily or financially.<ref name="Jones1998p117">Jones 1998, p. 117.</ref> With Nojpet<U+00E9>n safely in the hands of the Spanish, Urs<U+00FA>a returned to M<U+00E9>rida, leaving Kan Ek' and other high-ranking members of his family as prisoners of the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de los Remedios y San Pablo, isolated amongst the hostile Itza and Kowoj who still dominated the mainland. The garrison was reinforced in 1699 by a military expedition from Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, accompanied by mixed-race ''[[ladino people|ladino]]'' civilians who came to found their own town around the military camp. The settlers brought disease with them, which killed many soldiers and colonists and swept through the indigenous population. The Guatemalans stayed just three months before returning to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, taking the captive Itza king with them, together with his son and two of his cousins. The cousins died on the long journey to the colonial capital; Ajaw Kan Ek' and his son spent the rest of their lives under house arrest in the capital.<ref name="Jones09p59" />

When the Spanish conquered the Pet<U+00E9>n lakes in 1697, the Yalain were initially cooperative and assisted in the capture of the king of the Itza. At this time Yalain was ruled by Chamach Xulu. The Yalain leadership encouraged Christian conversion as a means of maintaining peace with the occupying Spanish forces. As time went on, Yalain cooperation with the Spanish appears to have decreased.<ref name="Jones 1998, p. 306"/> Soon after the conquest, the Yalain fled their settlements to avoid foraging Spanish parties that were abducting Maya women for "service" at their barracks. At this time, such was the hostility that was felt towards the occupying forces that the inhabitants of the Yalain settlements preferred to burn their fields and break all their pottery rather than leave anything for the Spanish.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 367<U+2013>368.</ref> The Yalain capital is recorded as having been burned in 1698.<ref name="Rice&c97p550">Rice et al 1997, p. 550.</ref>

==Final years of conquest==
[[File:Iglesia de Dolores, Pet<U+00E9>n.jpg|thumb|right|alt=An open field with patchy, worn grass extending towards a low church with a simple white facade. The facade has three short spires, with the middle spire taller than the flanking spires. The central spire supports a cross. The shorter spires sit above arched openings, a bell is visible in the left-hand arch. An arched wooden door is set into the facade; a square window is above it. The main body of the church only stands about half the height of the facade and extends back to the left. The wall is bare except for a smaller doorway and a small window. The roof is rusty corrugated metal. A lower building with a shaded balcony extends to the left of the church. Two poles support a power line running across the field to the church. The base of each pole is painted white. A line of trees runs across behind the church.|Spanish colonial church in Dolores]]
In the late 17th century, the small population of Ch'ol Maya in southern Pet<U+00E9>n and Belize was forcibly removed to Alta Verapaz, where the people were absorbed into the Q'eqchi' population.<ref name="Jones00p365"/> After the conquest, the colonial administration of Pet<U+00E9>n was divided between the ecclesiastical authorities in Yucat<U+00E1>n and secular administration as part of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. There was never a strong Spanish presence in the area, which remained remote, although the Spanish built a fortress-prison, the [[Castillo de Arismendi]]; it was finished in 1700.<ref>Arrivillaga Cort<U+00E9>s 1998, p. 53.</ref>

The distance from Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de los Remedios y San Pablo (formerly Nojpet<U+00E9>n) to M<U+00E9>rida, combined with the difficult terrain and the hostility of the natives led to the road from Yucat<U+00E1>n falling into a state of disrepair.<ref name="Fialko03p72"/> In 1701 Urs<U+00FA>a y Arezmendi realised that the road was in such a poor state that the Spanish garrison could not be supplied from Yucat<U+00E1>n. He wrote to the King of Spain, requesting that Pet<U+00E9>n be transferred from the jurisdiction of Yucat<U+00E1>n to the ''[[Audiencia Real]]'' of Guatemala.<ref>Fialko Coxemans 2003, pp. 72<U+2013>73.</ref> In 1703 Urs<U+00FA>a's petition was granted, with the condition that the ecclesiatical authority over Pet<U+00E9>n would pass to the Dominican Order.<ref name="Fialko03p73">Fialko Coxemans 2003, p. 73.</ref>

Between 1703 and 1753, ''reducciones'' were established at San Jos<U+00E9> and San Andr<U+00E9>s on Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>, Santa Ana just south of the lake, and at San Luis, Santo Toribio and [[Dolores, Pet<U+00E9>n|Dolores]] in the south (not to be confused with Dolores del Lakandon).<ref>Fialko Coxemans 2003, p. 73.<br>ITMB 1998.<br>Laporte Molina 1998, pp. 136<U+2013>137.</ref> Each of these mission towns had its own minister who answered to the ''[[vicar general|vicario general]]'' with the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de los Remedios y San Pablo.<ref name="Fialko03p73"/> In the first decades of the 18th century, churches were built in five colonial towns: Dolores, Remedios, San Andr<U+00E9>s, San Jos<U+00E9> and Santo Toribio.<ref name="Schwartz90p46">Schwartz 1990, p. 46.</ref> The church in Dolores was built in 1708; the construction was probably overseen by Juan Antonio Ruiz y Bustamante.<ref>Choc<U+00F3>n and Corzo 2009, p. 92.</ref> In 1699 there were nine priests in Pet<U+00E9>n but thereafter there was usually a shortage of clergy in colonial Pet<U+00E9>n. In spite of the objections of the Dominicans who had been working in southern Pet<U+00E9>n, the Franciscans continued to provide clergy from Yucat<U+00E1>n, and it was the Franciscans who oversaw the spiritual welfare of Pet<U+00E9>n during the colonial period.<ref name="Schwartz90p48">Schwartz 1990, p. 48.</ref>

AjTut was one of the lords of the northern Chak'an Itza province of the conquered Itza kingdom; friar Avenda<U+00F1>o had met him during his expedition to Nojpet<U+00E9>n. After the conquest he relocated from the north shore of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> to Mompana, a region lying between Lake Yaxha and the Classic period ruins of [[Tikal]]. For some years after the conquest he established the Mompana region as a refuge from the Spanish and engaged in internecine war against the surviving Kowoj to the south.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 6, 95.</ref>

===Reductions around Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>===
At the time of the fall of Nojpet<U+00E9>n, there are estimated to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>, including a large number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of them died during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war.<ref name="Jones00p364"/> Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, Spanish expeditions and internecine warfare between indigenous groups also played their part<ref name="Jones09p60"/>

Catholic priests from Yucat<U+00E1>n founded several mission towns around Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> in 1702<U+2013>1703.<ref name="Jones09p59"/> The first towns to be concentrated into colonial ''reducciones'' were Ixtutz, which became the new town of [[San Jos<U+00E9>, El Pet<U+00E9>n|San Jos<U+00E9>]], and neighbouring San Andr<U+00E9>s, both on the north shore of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>.<ref>Fialko Coxemans 2003, p. 73.<br>ITMB 1998.</ref> They were first subjugated by one of Urs<U+00FA>a's officers, Cristobal de Sologaistoa, before being passed into the care of the Dominican friars for the Christian conversion of the inhabitants.<ref name="Fialko03p73"/> Surviving Itza and Kowoj were resettled in the new colonial towns by a mixture of persuasion and force. Kowoj and Itza leaders in these mission towns rebelled against their Spanish overlords in 1704 and almost retook Nojpet<U+00E9>n,<ref>Jones 1998, p. xxi.<br>Jones 2009, p. 59.</ref> but although well-planned, the rebellion was quickly crushed. Its leaders were executed, and most of the mission towns were abandoned; by 1708 only about 6,000 Maya remained in central Pet<U+00E9>n.<ref name="Jones09p59" /> The reductions failed in large part because the missionaries charged with converting the inhabitants could not speak the [[Itza language]].<ref name="Fialko03p73"/>

==Legacy of the conquest==
Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a used his conquest of the Itza as a stepping stone to achieving the coveted post of [[Governor-General of the Philippines]], which he took up in 1709.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. xxi<U+2013>xxii, 115.</ref> European-introduced diseases devastated the native population of Pet<U+00E9>n, with the effects of disease compounded by the psychological impact of defeat. The population around Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> numbered between 20,000 and 40,000 in 1697. By 1714, a census recorded just over 3,000 individuals in Spanish Pet<U+00E9>n, including non-Indians. This number would not have included the so-called "wild" Maya living in the forest far from Spanish administration and control. By 1700 the new colonial capital of Pet<U+00E9>n was mainly inhabited by colonists, soldiers and convicts.<ref name="Schwartz90p38">Schwartz 1990, p. 38.</ref> During the second half of the 18th century, adult male Indians were heavily taxed, often being forced into [[Debt bondage|debt peonage]]. Western Pet<U+00E9>n and neighbouring Chiapas remained sparsely populated, and the Maya inhabitants avoided contact with the Spanish.<ref name="Schwartz90p39">Schwartz 1990, p. 39.</ref>

San Jos<U+00E9>, on the northwest shore of lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>, is the home of the last surviving speakers of the [[Itza' language|Itza language]]. The surname Kowoj still survives, but the Kowoj and Itza have fully merged and no longer exist as separate ethnicities. In modern times there is a history of conflict between San Jos<U+00E9> (the former Itza town of Chakok'ot) and neighbouring San Andr<U+00E9>s (the former Kowoj-allied town of Chak'an), and this mutual hostility probably represents ancient hostility between the Itza and the Kowoj.<ref>Hofling 2009, p. 79.<br>Jones 1998, p. 8.<br>Jones 2009, p. 60.</ref>

This was first published in Madrid in 1701 and detailed the history of Pet<U+00E9>n from 1525 through to 1699.<ref>Wauchope and Cline 1973, pp. 104<U+2013>105.</ref>

==Archaeology==
Urs<U+00FA>a referred to the western port town of Ch'ich' as ''Nich''. The modern name for a point on the south side of the bay is Punta Nijt<U+00FA>n, which is probably derived from the colonial Yucatec ''nix tun'', meaning stone ramp.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 266.<br>McNair et al 1997, p. 559.</ref> Archaeologists carried out excavations at the lake shore at Punta Nijt<U+00FA>n and discovered a stone ramp there, which was probably built by Urs<U+00FA>a's troops to launch his ''galeota''.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 266.</ref>
