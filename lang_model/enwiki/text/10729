'''''Is This It''''' is the debut [[studio album]] by American [[indie rock]] band [[The Strokes]]. Recorded at Transporterraum in New York City with [[Record producer|producer]] [[Gordon Raphael]], the album was first released on July&nbsp;30, 2001 in Australia, with [[RCA Records]] as the primary label. The record entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number two and peaked at number&nbsp;33 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard''&nbsp;200]], going on to achieve [[platinum record|platinum]] status in several markets. "[[Hard to Explain]]", "[[Last Nite]]", and "[[Someday (The Strokes song)|Someday]]" were released as [[single (music)|singles]].

For the album, The Strokes strived to capture a simple [[rock music|rock]] sound that was not significantly enhanced in the studio. Building on the work of their 2001 debut [[extended play|EP]], ''[[The Modern Age]]'', the band members molded compositions largely through live takes during the recording sessions, while lyricist [[Julian Casablancas]] continued to detail the lives and relationships of urban youth. Following the completion of ''Is This It'', The Strokes embarked on a promotional world tour before its release. The album's cover photograph courted controversy for being too sexually explicit and was replaced for the U.S. market. The American track listing was also amended in light of the [[September&nbsp;11 terrorist attacks]].

Promoted by the music press for a melodic [[pop music|pop]]-influenced sound, The Strokes garnered critical acclaim and commercial attention. ''Is This It'' was praised for its charisma and rhythm, which often referenced the works of 1970s [[garage rock]] bands.  The record is considered crucial in the development of other alternative bands and of the post-millennial music industry. It has featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 2000s and of all time.

== Origins ==
In 1997, The Strokes consisted of singer Julian Casablancas, guitarist [[Nick Valensi]], bassist [[Nikolai Fraiture]], and drummer [[Fabrizio Moretti]]. Casablancas's stepfather and Moretti's and Fraiture's older brothers introduced the quartet to the music of [[reggae]] artist [[Bob Marley]], [[protopunk]] group [[The Velvet Underground]], and [[alternative rock]] band [[Jane's Addiction]]. Discussing the formative stages of the group, Moretti noted, "Our music was, like, [<nowiki/>[[The Doors]]'<nowiki/>], but trying to be classical. We all took music classes and tried writing songs, and when we put them together they were this crazy amalgam of insane ideas that we thought was really cool." In 1998, [[Albert Hammond, Jr.]], who Casablancas knew from his time at a Swiss boarding school, moved to New York City to attend film school and joined The Strokes as a second guitarist.<ref name=RSINT>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5933812/the_strokes_of_genius/|title=The Strokes of Genius|author=Eliscu, Jenny|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=April 11, 2002|accessdate=November 20, 2009}}</ref> His arrival provided the catalyst for the band's musical and emotional evolution.<ref>Roach, p. 25</ref>

By 2000, all band members had part-time jobs and were practicing new material several nights a week in a small hired recording space. In the fall of that year, their [[demo (music)|demo]] caught the attention of [[Ryan Gentles]], a talent booker at New York City's [[Mercury Lounge]]. He scheduled The Strokes for four December gigs.<ref name=RSINT/> With support from personal mentor JP Bowersock and producer Gordon Raphael, the band recorded three tracks which later appeared on ''Is This It'': "The Modern Age", "Last Nite", and "Barely Legal". British label [[Rough Trade Records]] was impressed by the songs and released them as a January 2001 EP titled ''The Modern Age''. Music press reaction was very positive and The Strokes embarked on a sold-out UK tour, followed by U.S. support slots for alternative rock groups [[Doves (band)|Doves]] and [[Guided by Voices]].<ref name=rough>{{cite book |title=The Rough Guide to Rock|year=2003 |editor=Buckley, Peter|publisher=[[Rough Guides]]|isbn=1-84353-105-4 |page=1025}}</ref> Gentles quit his job to manage the band full-time and, in March 2001, The Strokes signed to RCA Records after a protracted bidding war.<ref name=RSINT/>

== Recording and production ==

After the deal with RCA, The Strokes started working with [[Gil Norton]], who had produced recordings for alternative rock group [[Pixies]]. Although a rapport developed between the two parties, the band remained unhappy at the results of preliminary sessions which sounded "too clean" and "too pretentious"; the three songs recorded with Norton were scrapped.<ref>Roach, p. 68</ref> Like ''The Modern Age'', ''Is This It'' was eventually recorded with Gordon Raphael at Transporterraum in [[East Village, Manhattan|Manhattan's East Village]] in New York City.<ref name=SOS/> The studio is located in a basement with poor lighting, but despite its poor infrastructure, it includes modern [[Pro Tools]] [[Digital Audio Workstation]] hardware. The Strokes liked Raphael's lack of ego and formed a good collaborative relationship with the producer.<ref name=bio70/>

{{quote box|quote="I just wanted to write music that could touch people. [As] a songwriter, you play a few [[chord (music)|chords]] and sing a melody that's been done a thousand times, and now you're a [[singer-songwriter]]. I think it takes a little more than that to do something that matters. And I wish I could write a song where all the parts work. When you hear a song like that, it's like finding a new friend."<ref name=RSINT/>|source=<U+2014>Julian Casablancas, on his philosophy of creating songs and his aim for the music of ''Is This It''|width=25%|align=right}}

Before recording started, both parties organized a listening session with the musical material Hammond and Casablancas had brought to show the tone and energy they liked. One of the prerequisites mentioned at the meeting was to take what was happening in music at the time, and go in a completely different direction. Casablancas wanted ''Is This It'' to sound like "a band from the past that took a time trip into the future to make their record". The approach for the album became more studied than that of ''The Modern Age''. The group wanted the majority of songs to sound like them playing live, while they requested a few others to be like "a weird, in-studio production with a [[drum machine]], even though no drum machine was used". The songs of the latter type were done track-by-track and were crafted into non-standard rock arrangements. Raphael's background in [[industrial music]] played a large part in the album's conception.<ref name=SOS/>

During six weeks in the studio, The Strokes' gritty sound became the emphasis of the sessions.<ref name=bio70>Roach, p. 70</ref> The band usually recorded songs only once, based on Casablancas's preference for "raw efficiency".<ref name=bio71/> [[Pro Co RAT|RAT]] [[effects pedal]]s and [[overdrive (music)|overdriving]] [[amplifier]]s were used at times, "taking sounds, disintegrating them and then bringing them back". The band wanted things to be only slightly [[stress (music)|stressed]], with no heavy-handedness in terms of studio effects; only [[distortion (music)|distortion]] and [[reverse echo]] were widely used. Throughout the process, Raphael improvised off the reactions that he got from the group. At one point, he had to cope with the threat of eviction from his Transporterraum studio, but once The Strokes received backing from RCA, time and money were no longer pressing concerns. The label's [[A&R]] delegate initially did not like what had been recorded and felt that the album was not going to be professional enough. The producer and the band were given complete control only when Casablancas persuaded the delegate by playing him some of the new material on a [[boom box]].<ref name=SOS/>

Inspired by The Velvet Underground's production and the direct approach of [[punk rock]] band [[Ramones]], the miking scheme for the [[drum kit]] included only three microphones: one above it, one for the [[bass drum]], and one in the corner of the studio.<ref>Roach, p. 61</ref> It was crafted to capture "a compressed, explosive sound". On Moretti's advice, the transfer from the two loud guitars and the rumble of the bass picked up by the drum-kit microphones was not eliminated. The guitars were recorded more simply; Hammond and Valensi both used [[Fender]] DeVille amps on opposite sides of the room, while Raphael positioned a mic on each. The sound was then fed directly into a [[preamp]] with no [[equalization]].<ref name=SOS/> Valensi commented that guitar teacher and mentor Bowersock was invaluable because he was articulating things to the producer that the group could not.<ref name=bio71>Roach, p. 71</ref> While the rest of The Strokes played to a [[click track]], Casablancas sang through a small [[Peavey Electronics|Peavey]] practice amp to retain a sense of [[low fidelity]] on the album. Raphael [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] as he went along to maintain control of the record until the final [[audio mastering|mastering]] stage; the producer aimed to show The Strokes a final product as soon as the band finished performing a track.<ref name=SOS/>

Following the album's completion, The Strokes performed at Philadelphia music venues on every Wednesday of May 2001.<ref name=MAY>{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-strokes/7572|title=The Strokes 'Explain' All|work=[[NME]]|date=April 27, 2001|accessdate=November 20, 2009}}</ref> The band revealed the track listing of ''Is This It'' on May&nbsp;15.

There's a lot of people here in America who think we've had it too easy, but they have never really heard the music."<ref name=BR/>

Following The Strokes' June&nbsp;20 show in Glasgow, Moretti suffered an awkward fall and was hospitalized with a broken hand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-strokes/8282|title=Strokes Liverpool Gig Postponed|work=[[NME]]|date=June 22, 2001|accessdate=November 20, 2009}}</ref> Two of the last five UK gigs were canceled and a friend of the group, Matt Romano, flew to England to replace the injured drummer in the remaining concerts.

''Is This It'' was released in Australia on July&nbsp;30, 2001 to capitalize on The Strokes' recent tour of the country. The record was streamed on Australian websites by the band's distributor [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] and remained available for listening even after the CD release. [[Geoff Travis]], head of The Strokes' UK label Rough Trade, commented that the Australian continent had "special dispensation" and that an export ban was put in place to ensure no interferences with release plans in the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-strokes/8788|title=Hear 'It'!|work=[[NME]]|date=July 31, 2001|accessdate=November 20, 2009}}</ref> The Japanese release date of August&nbsp;22 was timed to occur after two one-off shows by the band at the [[Summer Sonic Festival]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-strokes/8541|title=This Is It!|work=[[NME]]|date=July 12, 2001|accessdate=November 20, 2009}}</ref> while the UK release of August&nbsp;27 coincided with the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-strokes/8455|title=Fab!

== Packaging ==

The July and August 2001 [[cover art]] of ''Is This It'' is by Colin Lane and features a photograph of a woman's nude bottom and hip, with a leather-gloved hand suggestively resting on it.<ref name=cover>{{cite book |editor=Miles, Barry; Scott, Grant; Morgan, Johnny|title=The Greatest Album Covers of All Time|year=2008 |page=251|publisher=[[Anova Books]]|isbn=1-8434-0481-8}}</ref> The model was later revealed to be Lane's then-girlfriend, who explained that the photoshoot was spontaneous and happened after she came out of the shower naked. Lane recalled that a stylist had left the glove in his apartment and noted, "We did about 10 shots. There was no real inspiration, I was just trying to take a sexy picture."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-strokes/33930|title=The Strokes' 'Is This It' cover model revealed|work=[[NME]]|date=January 28, 2008|accessdate=November 20, 2009}}</ref> The result was included in the book ''The Greatest Album Covers of All Time'', in which Grant Scott, one of the editors, noted influences from the daring works of [[Helmut Newton]] and [[Guy Bordin]] in its design. Scott concludes, "It<U+2019>s either a stylish or graphically strong cover or a sexist ''[[Smell the Glove]]'' travesty." Although British retail chains [[HMV]] and [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]] objected to the photograph's controversial nature, they stocked the album without amendment.<ref name=cover/>

The group deliberately left out the grammatically correct question mark from the album title because aesthetically, "it did not look right".<ref name=bio77>Roach, p. 77</ref> The booklet insert contains stylized separate portraits of The Strokes, Raphael, Gentles, and Bowersock, all photographed by Lane.<ref name=bio71>Roach, p. 71</ref> For the American market and the October 2001 release, the cover art of ''Is This It'' was changed to a microscopic close-up of [[particle accelerator|particle collisions]]. RCA product manager Dave Gottlieb commented that "it was straight up a band decision", while Gentles indicated that Casablancas had wanted it to appear globally. According to the band's manager, the frontman phoned him before the Japan and Europe release and said, "I found something even cooler than the a ... picture." At the time, the Lane photograph was already at the presses and was included in the July and August 2001 versions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,254810,00.html|title=Hear & Now|author=Willman, Chris|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 14, 2001|accessdate=November 20, 2009}}</ref> The Strokes' 2003 biography mentions the fear of objections from America's conservative retail industry and right-wing lobby as reasons for the artwork's alteration.<ref name=bio77/>

 |description  = "Barely Legal" references a girl who has just achieved legal sexual age. It also includes simple upbeat drumming similar to a drum machine's output and guitars in the style of Britpop.<ref name=bio33/>
}}

Casablancas's writing observes life in New York City and the relationships formed in such a metropolis. Exemplifying this theme, "The Modern Age" is a rant about the oddness of modern life.<ref>Roach, p. 32</ref> "Barely Legal" concerns the subject matter of a girl who has just arrived at the [[age of consent]]. Discussing its risqu<U+00E9> nature, Moretti has stated, "It should be taken the way you interpret it. The lyrics mean different things to different people."<ref name=bio33>Roach, p. 33</ref> "Alone, Together" continues the sexual theme by dropping hints about [[cunnilingus]],<ref name=bio76>Roach, p. 76</ref> while the yelp at the start of "New York City Cops" was created as a pastiche of rock band [[Aerosmith]]. During the studio sessions, Casablancas introduced tracks with comic lines and some quips were used when the album was mixed.<ref name=bio77/>

=== Music ===
All songs on ''Is This It'' were mixed using 11&nbsp;audio tracks or less.<ref name=SOS/> According to Valensi, the album contains "no gimmicks, no tricks" to try to get the listener to like the compositions.<ref name=cmj>{{Cite news |author = Ridenour, Shelly|title=Stroke It|work=[[CMJ New Music Monthly]]|page=68|date=October 2001}}</ref> It opens with the title track, which features a simple, [[metronome|metronomic]] [[drum line]], a recurring feature in the rest of the record. Containing one of the slowest [[tempo]]s, "Is This It" is The Strokes' attempt at a [[ballad]].<ref name=bio76/> "The Modern Age" follows and includes a prominent guitar [[riff]] accompanied by a complementary drum line. Its [[staccato]] verse is followed by an upbeat, singalong chorus and a technically difficult [[guitar solo]].<ref name=bio33/> Discussing the album's simplicity and measured approach, Valensi has commented, "We don't put in a guitar solo just to have one."<ref name=cmj/> "Soma" incorporates jerky rhythms and starts and ends with the same guitar and drum chimes,<ref name=bio76/> while "Barely Legal" contains some of the album's softer guitar melodies inspired by [[Britpop]] as well as drumming patterns that evoke the sound of primitive 1980s drum machines.<ref name=bio33/>

The fifth track on the record, "Someday", is infused with [[rockabilly]] elements and interlocking guitar lines, the latter a recurring element of ''Is This It''. "Alone, Together" is driven by a staccato rhythm, and climaxes first with a guitar solo, then a repeat of the central guitar [[hook (music)|hook]].<ref name=bio76/> "Last Nite" is also a guitar-driven song, but leans towards pop music influences. At its core, there are reggae-inspired [[rhythm guitar]] lines played by Hammond, and studio [[white noise|noise]] effects. The [[rhythm section]] plays simple interlocking notes and beats.<ref name=bio33/> Like "Soma", "Hard to Explain" contains processed drum tracks using [[dynamic range compression]] and equalization studio techniques to make them sound like a drum machine.<ref name=SOS>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Apr02/articles/gordonraphael.asp|title=Different Strokes|author=Buskin, Richard|work=[[Sound on Sound]]|date=April 2002|accessdate=November 30, 2009}}</ref> The song incorporates spliced [[ad-libbing]] extras from Casablancas, a feature also used on "New York City Cops". "Trying Your Luck", the album's mellowest point, follows and shows more melancholic vocals. The last track on ''Is This It'', "Take It or Leave It", is the only song in which Hammond used the [[bridge (guitar)|bridge]] [[pickup (music technology)|pickup]] of his [[Fender Stratocaster]] guitar.<ref name=bio77/>
