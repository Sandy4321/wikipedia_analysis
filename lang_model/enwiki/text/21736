Retrieved 10 July 2014.</ref>) were climbing and caving pioneers. They are credited with establishing many classic climbs in areas like [[Carderock Recreation Area|Carderock]] in [[Maryland]], [[Seneca Rocks]] in [[West Virginia]], [[Cannon Mountain (New Hampshire)|Cannon Cliff]] in [[New Hampshire]] and [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]]. They are also well known as cave explorers who in 1960's and 70's discovered and mapped over 60 miles of [[Jewel Cave]], making it the world<U+2019>s third [[List of longest caves|longest cave system]].

During [[World War II]], Herb served as an electrical engineer for the Navy Department in Washington, DC.<ref name=nps/> Jan and Herb spent their spare time exploring the rocks surrounding Washington DC, most notably [[Carderock Recreation Area|Carderock]] where they began climbing in 1942. They climbed and named lots of the routes at Carderock, including ''Herbie<U+2019>s Horror'', ''Spider Walk'' and ''Ronnie<U+2019>s Leap'', which was named after their dog. ''Herbie<U+2019>s Horror'', first climbed by Herb, was one of the first [[Yosemite Decimal System|5.9]] routes in the eastern United States.<ref name=Green>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Stewart|title=Carderock Rock Climbing: Climbing Near Washington DC|url=http://climbing.about.com/od/wheretoclimb/fr/Carderock-Rock-Climbing-Climbing-Near-Washington-Dc.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref> They also made the first documented ascents of the routes ''Conn's East'' and ''Conn's West'' at [[Seneca Rocks]],<ref name=senecarocksmuseum>{{cite web|title=Herb and Jan Conn Inducted Into South Dakota Hall of Fame|url=http://www.senecarocksmuseum.org/2011/11/22/herb-and-jan-conn-inducted-into-south-dakota-hall-of-fame/|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref> following the pitons left by the mountain troops who trained there.  In a letter to the [[Potomac Appalachian Trail Club]] Mountaineering Section the Conns describe a visit to Seneca with [[Don Hubbard]]: "Don and the two of us climbed the south peak on a gorgeous moonlit evening, carrying sleeping bags, and spent the night on the narrow summit ridge.

== Traveling climbers ==
[[File:Conn - We work in out spare time - Summit Nov 1957 - 1.jpg|thumb|Jan and Herb Conn in their camper]]
In 1946, Herb was discharged from the US army and the Conns began five year period of traveling and climbing around the US with short forays into Canada and Mexico. They become pioneers of what is now praisingly refereed to as [[wiktionary:en:Special:Search/dirtbag|dirtbag]] climbing, which they described in the ''We work in out spare time'' article:<ref name=spare/> "''it is a simple matter of mathematics - two people working six months a year are just as good as one person working twelve months to support two people''".  They lived in self equipped camper converted from a "panel delivery truck".<ref name=spare>Conn, Jan and Herb (November 1957). ''We work in our spare time'' - Summit ([[:File:Conn - We work in our spare time - Summit Nov 1957.pdf|PDF]])</ref> For several years they worked odd jobs and climbed from Yosemite in California to Katahdn in Maine, making scattered first ascents along the way.  In 1952, Jan and her partner [[Jane Showacre]], become the first all woman team to free-climb  [[Devils Tower]].<ref name=nps/>  Before the development of specialized shoes, harnesses and the use of chalk, Herb and Jan climbed in cheap tennis shoes with a single strand of nylon rope about the waist and used heavy iron pitons for protection.<ref name=Climbing>{{cite news|last=Blackwell|first=David|title=Herb Conn Dies at 91|url=http://www.climbing.com/climber/herb-conn-dies-at-91/|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=Climbing|date=9 February 2012}}</ref><ref name=Green2/>

It was then that they discovered [[Needles (Black Hills)|the Needles]], with a seemingly unlimited quantity of excellent climbing.  They settled in the Black Hills and made around 220 first ascents in the Needles, and published a climbing guidebook to the area.  With no other climbers in the area they felt as Herb put it, <U+201C>like a couple of cats in an untended fish market.<U+201D><ref name=Green2>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Stewart|title=The Needles Rock Climbing: Climbing in South Dakota|url=http://climbing.about.com/od/wheretoclimb/fr/The-Needles-Rock-Climbing-Climbing-In-South-Dakota.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=26 January 2014}}</ref><ref name="Conns53">Conn, Herb (June 1953).

In 1959, geologist, mountaineer and caver [[Dwight Deal]] had done some exploration in a small cave called [[Jewel Cave]], a little known monument in the National Park System . He needed some companions who might help him continue his exploration trips there and turned to his friends, Herb and Jan. He asked if they would be interested in grubbing around underground and, after thinking it over, they replied they would try it "once". That one trip turned into a passion of exploring Jewel Cave that lasted for over 22 years, and took over 6,000 volunteer hours on 700 trips.<ref name=RapidCity>{{cite news|last=Garrigan|first=Mary|title=Jewel Cave pioneer Herb Conn dies|url=http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/jewel-cave-pioneer-herb-conn-dies/article_400b3f62-4ee6-11e1-bb4d-0019bb2963f4.html|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=Rapid City Journal.|date=4 February 2012}}</ref> From 1959 to 1979, Herb and Jan mapped 62.36 miles of the interior of Jewel Cave.<ref name=nps>{{cite web|title=Cave Explorers: Herb & Jan Conn|url=http://www.nps.gov/jeca/naturescience/caveexplorers.htm|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref> The Conns discovered what is now the Scenic Cave Tour route in 1961. The National Park Service was intrigued by their reports of high, narrow passageways, huge rooms and unusual speleothems (cave decorations) and opened a new tour route.  In addition to assisting with the construction of this trail, Herb also designed the lighting system and dramatic placement of lights still in use today. The cave winds that enticed the explorers further into the cave fascinated Herb, and in 1966 he produced an important scientific paper explaining reasons for these barometric winds. The Conn's book, "The Jewel Cave Adventure" serves not only as a record of their years of cave exploration here, but as an exciting tale of adventure even for non-cavers.

In years 1963-1965, when exploration trips into [[Jewel Cave]] were restricted, Conns joined [[David Schnute]], exploring [[Wind Cave]]. In 1963 the trio found new passages breaking-away from the known portion of the cave and allowing them to discover, name, and survey 15,740 feet of virgin cave.<ref>{{cite web|last=Conn|first=Jan and Herb|title=Diaries of Wing Cave Trips|url=http://www.nps.gov/wica/historyculture/upload/WICA_15961-Conn-Diary-of-WICA-Trips.pdf|accessdate=17 January 2014|year=1987}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cave Exploration - Herb and Jan Conn and Dave Schnute|url=http://www.nps.gov/wica/historyculture/cave-exploration-herb-and-jan-conn-and-dave-schnute.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref> They largely retired from caving by the early 1980s.
