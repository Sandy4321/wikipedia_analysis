Muni '''Jambuvijay''' was a [[Jain monasticism|monk]] belonging to the [[Svetambara]] sect of [[Jainism]]. He was known for his pioneering work in research, cataloging and translations of [[Jain Agamas]] and ancient texts. He was responsible for discovering and publishing many ancient [[Jains texts]] lying in different forgotten Jain ''jnana bhandaras'' (ancient Jain libraries). He was a disciple of Muni Punyavijay. Both Muni Punyavijay and Jambuvijay had worked all their life in the compilation and publication of our ancient [[Jain Agama]] literature and cataloging ancient Jain jnana bhandaras. 

Muni Jambuvijay was a scholar who devoted his entire life to critically editing the Jain scriptures. His death is a great loss to Indological studies and especially the academic study of Jainism. 

==Revival of ancient scriptures==
Prof. Dr. John Cort mentions the difficulties faced and the persistence shown by Muni Jambuvijay in ensuring that ancient manuscripts which were under lock and key were brought to light. Many bhandaras like the one at Patan were under unopened for decades or centuries and Muni Jambuvijay had to often use his mendicant charisma to convince the trustee to open up the libraries.<ref>{{cite journal
