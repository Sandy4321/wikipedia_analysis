'''Paul Craig Roberts''' (born April 3, 1939) is an American [[economist]] and a columnist for [[Creators Syndicate]]. He served as an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the [[Reagan Administration]] earning fame as a co-founder of [[Reaganomics]].<ref name=nationalreview>Roberts, Paul Craig (June 10, 2004). [http://www.nationalreview.com/reagan/roberts200406101413.asp The Real Reagan Record (August 31, 1992)]. ''National Review''. Retrieved on February 27, 2010.</ref>  He is a former editor and columnist for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]], [[Business Week]]'', and [[Scripps Howard News Service]] who has testified before congressional committees on 30 occasions on issues of economic policy. 

Roberts has written extensively that during the 21st century the Bush and Obama administrations have destroyed the US Constitution's protections of Americans' civil liberties, such as habeas corpus and due process in the name of "the war on terror." Roberts has been a critic of both Democratic and Republican administrations. Roberts has compared supporters of George W. Bush to "brownshirts with the same low intelligence and morals as Hitler's enthusiastic supporters." He has opposed the War on Drugs and the [[War on Terror]] stating it has "made widows and orphans of millions of Muslims". Roberts is a critic of Israel's policy toward [[Gaza]] "the world's largest concentration camp" populated by people who were "driven out of Palestine so that Israel could steal their land."{{fact|date=November 2012}} 

==Biography==
Roberts is a graduate of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] and holds a Ph.D. from the [[University of Virginia]]. He was a post-graduate at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and at [[Merton College]], [[Oxford University]].<ref name=vdare/> His first scholarly article (Classica et Mediaevalia) was a reformulation of "The [[Henri Pirenne|Pirenne]] Thesis."

In ''Alienation and the Soviet Economy'' (1971), Roberts explained the [[Soviet]] economy as the outcome of a struggle between inordinate aspirations and a refractory reality. He argued that the Soviet economy was not centrally planned, but that its institutions, such as material supply, reflected the original [[Marxist]] aspirations to establish a non-market mode of production. In ''Marx's Theory of Exchange'' (1973), Roberts argued that [[Marx]] was an organizational theorist whose materialist conception of history ruled out good will as an effective force for change.

From 1975 to 1978, Roberts served on the congressional staff. As economic counsel to Congressman [[Jack Kemp]]<ref name=bulletin>''[[The Bulletin (Bend)|The Bulletin]]'', 30 January 1981, "Roberts nominated"</ref> he drafted the Kemp-Roth bill (which became the [[Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981]]) and played a leading role in developing bipartisan support for a supply-side economic policy.<ref name=vdare/> His influential 1978 article for ''[[Harper's]]'',<ref>Paul Craig Roberts, "[http://www.harpers.org/archive/1978/03/0023812 Disguising the tax burden: Little-known facts beneath the rhetoric of reform]", ''[[Harper's]]'', March 1978</ref> while economic counsel to Senator [[Orrin Hatch]],<ref>Bruce Bartlett, ''Human Events'', 28 January 2002, "'Rich' Pay More Than What's Fair.", 58(4), p14</ref> had ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' editor [[Robert L. Bartley]] give him an editorial slot, which he had until 1980.<ref>Paul Craig Roberts, ''[[Washington Times]]'', 17 December 2003, "Two who made a difference"</ref> He was a senior fellow in political economy at the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], then part of [[Georgetown University]].<ref name=bulletin/>

From early 1981 to January 1982 he served as [[United States Assistant Secretary of the Treasury|Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy]]. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Donald Regan]] credited him with a major role in the [[Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981]], and he was awarded the Treasury Department's Meritorious Service Award for "outstanding contributions to the formulation of United States economic policy."<ref name=vdare/> Roberts resigned in January 1982 to become the first occupant of the [[William E. Simon]] Chair for Economic Policy at the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], then part of [[Georgetown University]].<ref>''Toledo Blade'', 19 January 1982, ''Treasury Dept. Economist Quits Post: Advocate of Tax-Cut Plan Going To Georgetown U''</ref> He held this position until 1993. He went on to write ''The Supply-Side Revolution'' (1984), in which he explained the reformulation of [[macroeconomic theory]] and policy that he had helped to create.

He was a Distinguished Fellow at the [[Cato Institute]] from 1993 to 1996. He was a Senior Research Fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]].<ref name=vdare/>

In ''The New Color Line'' (1995), Roberts argued that the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] was subverted by the bureaucrats who applied it and, by being used to create status-based privileges, became a threat to the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in whose name it was passed. In ''The Tyranny of Good Intentions'' (2000), Roberts documented what he saw as the erosion of the [[Blackstone's formulation|Blackstonian legal principles]] that ensure that law is a shield of the innocent and not a weapon in the hands of government.

==Recognition==
In 1987 the French government recognized him as "the artisan of a renewal in economic science and policy after half a century of state interventionism" and inducted him into the [[L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur|Legion of Honor]] on March 20, 1987. The French Minister of Economics and Finance, [[Edouard Balladur]], came from France to present the medal to Roberts.  President Reagan sent OMB Director [[James C. Miller III|Jim Miller]] to the ceremony with a letter of congratulation.<ref name=vdare/>

In 1992 he received the Warren Brookes Award for Excellence in Journalism from the free-market [[American Legislative Exchange Council]]. In 1993 the Forbes Media Guide ranked him as one of the top seven journalists in the United States.<ref name=vdare>[http://www.vdare.com/roberts/bio.htm Biography - Paul Craig Roberts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Views==
===Criticism of Bush===
Roberts opposed the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]] and writes frequently on the subject. On May 18, 2005, in response to the publication of the "[[Downing Street memo]]," Roberts wrote an article calling for Bush's [[impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] for lying to Congress about the case for war.

Roberts was also a critic of a potential Bush administration attack on [[Iran]]. In an August 15, 2005 article, he states "Bush...dismisses all facts and assurances and is willing to attack Iran based on nothing but [[Israel]]'s paranoia."

Although his criticisms of Bush often seem to align him with the [[political left]], Roberts continues to explain [[Ronald Reagan]]'s two goals--to end [[stagflation]] and the cold war. Roberts has written that "true conservatives" were the "first victims" of the [[Neoconservatism|neoconized]] Bush administration.<ref>[http://www.CounterPunch.org/roberts02062006.html Paul Craig Roberts: Who Will Save America?]</ref> He has said that supporters of George W. Bush "are [[Sturmabteilung|brownshirts]] with the same low intelligence and morals as [[Hitler]]'s enthusiastic supporters."<ref>[http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2006/7/5/130853.shtml The Reality Beneath the Flag-Waving]</ref>

===Israel===
In an article for ''Counterpunch'' magazine titled "Pirates of the Mediterranean", Roberts wrote that for 60 years, Israel  has replicated "the 17th, 18th, and 19th century theft of [[Indigenous people of the United States|American Indian]] lands by US settlers."  Roberts repeated charges that [[Gaza]] is "the world largest concentration camp" populated by people who were "driven out of Palestine so that Israel could steal their land." He called the [[U.S. State Department]] a "puppet" of the Israelis and the U.S. itself a [[puppet state]]" of the Israelis. He concludes that "there<U+2019>s no money for California, or for Americans<U+2019> [[health care]], or for the several million Americans who have lost their homes and are homeless, because Israel needs it."<ref>[http://www.counterpunch.org/roberts07012009.html Counterpunch]</ref>

The [[Anti-Defamation League]], a Jewish organization, has criticized  Roberts as promoting [[anti-semitism]] for his increasing focus on "criticism of Israel and Jews" making his writings "popular with fringe publications on both the left and the right".<ref>[http://www.adl.org/main_Extremism/paul-craig-roberts-promotes.htm Syndicated Columnist Paul Craig Roberts Promotes Anti-Semitism Syndicated Columnist Paul Craig Roberts Promotes Anti-Semitism]</ref> Roberts nominated Israeli peace activist [[Jeff Halper]] for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] and he cautions against confusing a right-wing Zionist government with world Jewry.  In one of his columns, "What Became of Western Morality?" (January 2005), he noted that it is Israeli newspapers, not American ones, that protest the Israeli government's "atrocities" against Palestinians:

"It is the goyim moralists who are silent, not the Jews. It is the Israeli newspaper<U+00A0>Haaretz, not the goyim media, that provides reports of Israel<U+2019>s abuse of Palestinians. Gideon Levy<U+2019>s <U+201C>The Neighborhood Bully Strikes Again<U+201D> was published in<U+00A0>''Haaretz''<U+00A0>on Dec. 29, not in the goyim press. Levy<U+2019>s words<U+2014><U+201D>Once again, Israel<U+2019>s violent responses, even if there is justification for them, exceed all proportion and cross every red line of humaneness, morality, international law and wisdom<U+201D><U+2014>are not words that can appear in American print or TV media. Such words, printed in Israeli newspapers, never reach the goyim."

Roberts cautions against blaming all Jews for crimes of a right-wing government:

"The world will need to remember that although Israel is a Jewish state, it is a state whose policies many Jews find objectionable, just as a majority of American Jews oppose President Bush<U+2019>s wars of aggression in the Middle East and his unconstitutional policies at home. We must not confuse Israel<U+2019>s Zionist government with world Jewry, just as we must not confuse the American people with the war criminals in the Bush regime.

"Consider, who do you trust with your civil liberties, the U.S. Department of Justice or the ACLU<U+2019>s phalanx of Jewish attorneys? [In Who's Who In America, Roberts lists himself as a member of the ACLU.]

"We must avoid the mistake that was made by blaming the German people for Adolf Hitler. It was the aristocratic German military that tried to remove Hitler. In contrast, Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi blocked the attempt to impeach George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. Pelosi is a discredit to California, but shall we blame all of America for Pelosi<U+2019>s defense of war criminals? How can we do so when U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich courageously read out the articles of impeachment on the House floor?

"Are all Americans guilty because Kucinich did not prevail?" <ref>[http://radioislam.org/eng/duble-standard.htm 09-01- 2009  article]</ref>

===The South Ossetia War===
In an interview on August 27, 2008, on a broadcast of [[Alex Jones (radio host)|The Alex Jones Show]], Roberts stated that he believed that influential [[neoconservatives]] affiliated with the [[George W. Bush administration]] were leading the United States into a [[Mutually Assured Destruction|nuclear confrontation]] with [[Russia]] over the [[2008 South Ossetia war|situation in Georgia and South Ossetia]]. Roberts gave the conflict <U+201C>almost total certainty if John McCain gets in office" and stated that the [[wikt:conflict|conflict]] would be in a timeframe of about two or three years.<ref>[http://www.infowars.com/?p=4191 Infowars]</ref>

===2009<U+2013>2010 Iranian election protests===
In a June 19<U+2013>21, 2009 article in ''[[CounterPunch]]'' about the [[2009<U+2013>2010 Iranian election protests]] following the re-election of [[Ahmadinejad]], Robert stated that while "the protests ... no doubt have many sincere participants," they "also have the hallmarks of the CIA orchestrated protests in Georgia and Ukraine. "<ref>Paul Craig Roberts, "Is This the Culmination of Two Years of Destabilization" [http://www.counterpunch.org/2009/06/19/are-the-iranian-protests-another-us-orchestrated-quot-color-revolution-quot/]</ref>

===September 11, 2001 attacks===

Of the 9/11 Commission Report, he wrote in 2006, "One would think that if the report could stand analysis, there would not be a taboo against calling attention to the inadequacy of its explanations." (see [[Criticisms of the 9/11 Commission Report]]). He has reported  findings by experts that conclude there is a large energy deficit in the official account of the collapse of the three WTC buildings, and says that this deficit remains unexplained.

Roberts comments on the "scientific impossibility" of the official explanation for the events on 9/11. On August 18, 2006, he wrote:
<blockquote>I will begin by stating what we know to be a solid incontrovertible scientific fact. We know that it is strictly impossible for any building, much less steel columned buildings, to <U+201C>pancake<U+201D> at free fall speed. Therefore, it is a non-controversial fact that the official explanation of the collapse of the WTC buildings is false... Since the damning incontrovertible fact has not been investigated, speculation and <U+201C>[[conspiracy theories]]<U+201D> have filled the void.<ref name="ICH">{{cite news | first=Paul Craig | last=Roberts | coauthors= | title=What we know and don<U+2019>t know about 9/11 | date=2006-08-16 |  url =http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article14566.htm | work =Information Clearing House  | accessdate = 2007-12-06  }}</ref></blockquote>

=== Anwar al-Awlaki ===

When [[Anwar al-Awlaki]], who was linked to some of the hijackers, was killed by a drone attack, Roberts objected, calling it "The Day America Died". He wrote that although Awlaki was critical of "indiscriminate assaults on Muslim peoples" and "told Muslims that they did not have to passively accept American aggression", the US lacked evidence that either Awlaki was a real threat or an Al Qaeda operative<ref>{{cite news| url=http://lewrockwell.com/roberts/roberts328.html | location=London | work=lewrockwell | title=the day america died | date=October 3, 2011}}</ref>

===US media ===
*"Anyone who depends on print, TV, or [[right-wing]] talk radio media is totally misinformed. The Bush administration has achieved a de facto [[Ministry of propaganda|Ministry of Propaganda]]."<ref name="counterpunch.org">[http://www.counterpunch.org/roberts02062006.html Paul Craig Roberts: Who Will Save America?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
*"The uniformity of the US media has become much more complete since the days of the cold war. During the 1990s, the US government permitted an unconscionable concentration of print and broadcast media that terminated the independence of the media. Today the US media is owned by 5 giant companies in which pro-Zionist Jews have disproportionate influence. More importantly, the values of the conglomerates reside in the broadcast licenses, which are granted by the government, and the corporations are run by corporate executives<U+2014>not by journalists<U+2014>whose eyes are on advertising revenues and the avoidance of controversy that might produce boycotts or upset advertisers and subscribers."<ref>[http://www.vdare.com/roberts/060816_what_know.htm VDARE.com: 08/16/06 - What We Know And Don<U+2019>t Know About 9/11<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Society===
"If I had time to research my writings over the past 30 years, I could find examples of partisan articles in behalf of Republicans and against Democrats. However, political partisanship is not the corpus of my writings. I had a 16-year stint as ''[[Business Week]]'s first outside columnist, despite hostility within the magazine and from the editor's New York social set, because the editor regarded me as the most trenchant critic of the George H.W. Bush administration in the business. The White House felt the same way and lobbied to have me removed from the William E. Simon Chair in Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies... In their hatred of "the rich," the left-wing overlooks that in the 20th century the rich were the class most persecuted by government. The class genocide of the 20th century is the greatest genocide in history."<ref name="counterpunch.org"/> Here he is referring to the mass murders in the Soviet Union and Maoist China of people for being members of the wrong class. His point is that as bad as Hitler's race genocide policies were, more people died as a result of the communists' class genocide policies.

===Outsourcing jobs===
Roberts testified before the US<U+2013>China Commission and written many articles saying  that the offshoring of high productivity, high value-added jobs in manufacturing and professional services is dismantling the ladders of upward mobility that made the U.S. an opportunity society.  Consequently, he is an opponent of [[Global labor Aarbitrage]].  His latest book, published in German (2012) and Chinese, ''The Failure of Laissez-Faire Capitalism and the Economic Erosion of the West'' (Weltbuch, Dresden, 2012) critiques and reformulates large areas of economic theory.

===War on Drugs===
Though Roberts worked for the Reagan administration, which implemented a "[[zero tolerance]]" and "[[Just Say No]]" policy on [[illegal drug]]s and increased spending to combat drugs, in 2007, he penned an article on the web site VDare.com criticizing the excess of the [[War on Drugs]] which he termed the "[[militarization]] of local [[police]]".<ref name="vdare1">Paul Craig Roberts, [http://www.vdare.com/roberts/070123_swat.htm Drug War Has Militarized Your Local Police]</ref>

===War on Terror===
Roberts asked "Is the War on Terror a Hoax", and claims it has "killed, maimed, dislocated, and made widows and orphans of millions of Muslims in six countries". Roberts called the attacks "naked aggression" on civilian populations and infrastructure which constitute war crimes.".<ref name="vdare1"/>

===Republican Party===
Roberts is seriously dismayed by what he considers the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s disregard for the [[United States Constitution]]. He has voiced his regret that he ever worked for it, avowing that, had he known what it would become, he would never have contributed to the [[Reagan Revolution]].<ref>[http://www.counterpunch.org/roberts07232008.html The mother of all messes]</ref>

===American democracy and oligarchy===
Roberts has been increasingly critical of what he deems as the lessening of [[democracy]] in the U.S.; instead accusing it of being run by [[oligarchy|oligarchs]] by stating:
{{quote|"The west prides itself that it is the standard for the world, that it is a democracy. But nowhere do you see democratic outcomes: not in Greece, not in Ireland, not in the UK, not here, the outcomes are always to punish the innocent and reward the guilty. And that's what the Greeks are in the streets, protesting. We see this all over the west. There is no democracy, there are oligarchies, some of these smaller European countries are not even run by their own governments, they are run by Wall Street... There is probably more democracy in China than there is in the west. Revolution is the only answer... We are confronted with a curious situation. Throughout the west we think we have democracy, we hold ourselves up high, we demonize China, we talk about the mafia state of Russia, we talk about the Arabs and so on, but where is the democracy here?" <ref>Paul Craig Roberts, "There Is Probably More Democracy In China Than There Is In The West" Video Interview, May 2011 [http://www.zerohedge.com/article/co-founder-reagonomics-paul-craig-roberts-there-probably-more-democracy-china-there-west Co-Founder Of Reaganomics]</ref>}}

===Cessation and resumption of journalism===
On March 26, 2010, Roberts announced he was "signing off" as a journalist in a column titled  "Truth Has Fallen and Taken Liberty With It".<ref>"Good-Bye: Truth Has Fallen and Taken Liberty With It" counterpunch.org March 24, 2010 [http://www.counterpunch.org/roberts03242010.html] </ref> However, after  receiving thousands of emails demanding that he continue to write. {{citation needed |date=November 2012}}  Two months later he resumed writing.

In January 2012, his website, www.paulcraigroberts.org, appeared with a decade-long archive of his 21st century columns.

===Financial crisis and the Federal Reserve===
Roberts has argued that the [[Libor scandal]] completes the picture of public and private financial institutions manipulating [[interest rate]]s in order to prop up the prices of bonds and other [[fixed income]] instruments, and that <U+201C>the motives of the Fed, Bank of England, US and UK banks are aligned, their policies mutually reinforcing and beneficial. The Libor fixing is another indication of this collusion.<U+201D> <ref name="OpEd News ">{{Cite news|author=Paul Craig Roberts and Nomi Prins|title= The Real Libor Scandal|url= http://www.opednews.com/articles/The-Real-Libor-Scandal-by-Paul-Craig-Roberts-120714-763.html| work=OpEd News |date= July 14, 2012  |accessdate= 15 July 2012  | location=.}}</ref> Roberts recommends stricter [[bank regulation]], and a profound reform of the [[Federal Reserve System]].

==Published works==
He has written or co-written ten books, contributed chapters to numerous books and has published many articles in journals of scholarship.

His writings frequently appear on [[OpEdNews]],  [[Antiwar.com]], . [[LewRockwell.com]], ''[[CounterPunch]]'', [[Global Research]], [[Foreign Policy Journal]] and in foreign translation around the world,
including Germany, Russia, and China.
