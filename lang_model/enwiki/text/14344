'''St. Michael's Cathedral''' (Chinese: {{lang|zh|<U+5723><U+5F4C><U+683C><U+723E><U+4E3B><U+6559><U+5EA7><U+5802>}}) in [[Qingdao]], (formerly ''Tsingtao''), Shandong Province, China, is the seat of the Bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Qingdao]].  It is located in the oldest part of [[Qingdao]], at 15 Zhejiang Road, on the east side of Zhongshan Road in [[Shinan District]]. Built by German missionaries, the cathedral stands at the top of a hill in the center of the old German-built part of the city. It is the largest example of [[Romanesque architecture#Romanesque Revival|Romanesque Revival architecture]] in the province, resembling a German cathedral of the 12th century.  

St. Michael's Cathedral is the product of a strong German presence in Shandong Province in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the mid-19th century the European powers forcibly opened China to foreign trade. The [[Divine Word Missionaries]] built a church in the [[Jiaozhou Bay concession]] in Shandong in 1902, and in 1934 erected the cathedral, which remained nominally under their administration until 1964. In 1942 it came under the control of the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]], returning to Chinese control when the Japanese left Qingdao in 1945. In the early 1950s, all foreign missionaries, including the Bishop of Qingdao, were either imprisoned or expelled from China, and during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966&ndash;1976) the cathedral was defaced and abandoned.  In 1981, it was repaired by the government and reopened for services, and in 1992 it was listed as a Provincial Historic Building by the government of Shandong Province.

==History==
After China's defeat in the [[First Opium War]], the country was forcibly opened to foreign trade by a number of treaties collectively referred to as the [[Unequal Treaties]]. Following the [[Treaty of Nanjing]] (1842), the British established the first [[treaty ports]]. Following China's [[Concession (territory)|concession]] to the British Empire, other foreign powers including France, the United States, Portugal, Germany, Japan, and Russia won concessions as well.<ref name="Britannica">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/603897/treaty-port |title=Treaty Port|author=Zhihou Xia |date=September 5, 2008 |work=www.britannica.com |publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica |accessdate=April 29, 2010}}</ref> Foreigners, who were centered in foreign sections of the cities, enjoyed legal [[extraterritoriality]] as stipulated in the Unequal Treaties. Foreign clubs, racecourses, and churches were established in major treaty ports. Some of these port areas were directly leased by foreign powers, such as the [[concessions in China]], effectively removing them from the control of local governments.<ref name="Britannica" />

===German presence in Qingdao===
{{Main|Jiaozhou Bay concession}}
In the early 1890s, the German Empire had been considering occupying [[Jiaozhou Bay]] ("Jiaozhou" was formerly romanized as Kiaochow, Kiauchau or Kiao-Chau in English and Kiautschou in German) for building its first naval base in East Asia in order to expand into the interior of Shandong.<ref name="Gerber">{{cite web |url=http://www.pacificrim.usfca.edu/research/perspectives/app_v5n1_gerber.pdf |title=The Role of German Missionaries in Post-Boxer North China |last1= |first1=Lydia |last2=Gerber |first2= |date=December 2004 |work=Asia Pacific: Perspectives |publisher=University of San Francisco |accessdate=June 22, 2010}}</ref> In 1891 the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing government]] decided to make Qingdao (commonly spelled "Tsingtao" until well into the 20th century) defensible against naval attack and began to improve the existing fortifications of the town. German naval officials observed and reported on this Chinese activity during a formal survey of Jiaozhou Bay in May 1897. In November 1897, the German Navy seized Jiaozhou Bay under the pretext of ensuring that reparations were paid for the murder of two German Catholic missionaries in the province.<ref name="Gerber" /><ref>{{cite book |title=By Order of the Kaiser, Otto von Diederichs and the Rise of the Imperial German Navy 1865<U+2013>1902 |last=Gottschall |first=Terrell |year=2003 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis |isbn=978-1557503091 |page=146 }}</ref> In the spring of 1898, the German government signed a treaty that allowed the Germans to lease an area of 540 square km for 99 years, to construct a railway to [[Jinan]], the capital of Shandong province, and to exploit coalfields along the railroad.<ref name="Gerber" />

The [[Jiaozhou Bay concession]], as it became known, existed from 1898 to 1914. With an area of {{convert|552|km2|acre sqmi|lk=off}}, it was located in the imperial province of [[Shandong]] (alternatively romanized as Shantung or Shan-tung) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula in northern China. Qingdao was its administrative center. According to Dr. Wilhelm Matzat, of the University of Bonn, "The so-called ''Marktstrasse'' (Market street) was nothing more than the old main street of the Chinese village of Tsingtao, and the buildings lining it were the former homes of fishermen and farmers. Having sold their property, they resettled their homes and fields in the villages further east."<ref name="Matzat1">{{cite web |url=http://www.tsingtau.org/landmann-gottfried-1860-1926-uhrmacher-optiker-bierbrauer/ |title=Landmann Gottfried 1860<U+2013>1926 Uhrmacher, Optiker, Bierbrauer |language=German |trans_title=Gottfried Landmann, 1860<U+2013>1926: Watchmaker, Optician, Beer Brewer |last1=Matzat |first1=Wilhelm |date= May 2003 |work=tsingtau.org |publisher=Wilhelm Matzat |accessdate=June 9, 2010}}</ref> On gaining control of the area, the Germans outfitted the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao with wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply.<ref name="Flagge">{{cite book |last1=Schultz-Naumann |first1=Joachim  |authorlink1= |title=Unter Kaisers Flagge: Deutschlands Schutzgebiete im Pazifik und in China einst und heute |trans_title=Under the Kaiser's Flag: Germany's protected areas in the Pacific and in China then and now |date=1985 |publisher=Universitas |language=German |isbn=978-3800410941 |page=183}}</ref> The buildings were built in a European style.<ref name="Matzat1" /> The area had the highest density of schools and per capita student enrollment in all of China; primary, secondary and vocational schools were funded by the [[German Empire|Imperial German]] treasury and [[Protestant]] and Roman Catholic missions.<ref name="Flagge" />

[[File:Qingdao Catholic Mission.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A black and white photograph, taken from an oblique view of the SVD Mission Hall|Society of the Divine Word Mission Hall in 1902]]
The cathedral was built by the [[Divine Word Missionaries]] (abbreviated "SVD," from their Latin name: ''Societas Verbi Divini''), the first German Catholic missionary society. The order was founded in 1875 "for the propagation of the Catholic religion among pagan nations," at Steyl (today in the [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg Province]] of the Netherlands), by German Catholic priests fleeing the [[Kulturkampf]].<ref name=CE>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05054a.htm |title=Society of the Divine Word in the Catholic Encyclopedia|author=Limbrock, E. |date=1909 |work=www.newadvent.org |publisher=New Advent |accessdate=March 8, 2010}}</ref> The society's first mission was established in 1882 in southern Shantung, a district of more than 10&nbsp;million people, which contained 158 Catholics.<ref name=CE /> At the time, the area was part of the [[Apostolic Vicariate]] of Shantung, managed by Italian [[Franciscan]]s, who were tasked with rebuilding the earlier Catholic mission work.

{{quote|One day, scaffolding was tied to the church steeples. People said that the crosses would be removed. The news spread throughout the city. Numerous people watched from windows, from the streets, from the beaches, and from the mountaintops as several small, ghostlike figures climbed upto the crosses. Against the blue sky they opened a saw. It was said that by evening, two people had fallen from the tower and died on the spot. People also say that this church held one of the greatest [[pipe organ]]s in China. They say that when it played, the whole city could hear its music. But this rare treasure was also destroyed by the Red Guards.

The next morning, seeing the towers of the church, the steeple had been denuded, and the towers were bald, like the shaved heads of criminals. The onlookers felt extremely uncomfortable, as if the whole area had been corrupted; made evil. Not long after that, I occasionally passed by the church and was astonished to see the topped crosses: what originally appeared to be two thin needles [when viewed from the towers] was actually the size of two coarse, heavy men, one taller than the other.

===Restoration===
<p>The Chinese government subsequently repudiated the Cultural Revolution. A major document presented at the September 1979 Fourth Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee, gave a "preliminary assessment" of the entire 30-year period of Communist rule. At the plenum, party Vice Chairman [[Ye Jianying]] declared the Cultural Revolution "an appalling catastrophe" and "the most severe setback to [the] socialist cause since [1949]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-chaos.umd.edu/history/prc4.html |title=The People's Republic Of China: IV |author=Poon, Leon |work=History of China |accessdate=April 4, 2010}}</ref> [[File:Bishop of Qingdao Cathedra.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A polished wooden chair on a raised dais, under a polished wooden canopy trimmed with crimson curtains.|The ''[[cathedra]]'' of the Bishop of Qingdao]]The Chinese government's condemnation of the Cultural Revolution culminated in the ''Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China'', adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This stated that "Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist and theorist. It is true that he made gross mistakes during the "cultural revolution", but, if we judge his activities as a whole, his contributions to the Chinese revolution far outweigh his mistakes. His merits are primary and his errors secondary."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idcpc.org.cn/english/maozedong/comments.htm |title=Comrade Mao Zedong's Historical Role and Mao Zedong Thought --Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China (abridged) |author=Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China |date=June 27, 1981 |publisher=Communist Party of China |accessdate=April 4, 2010}}</ref>

The change in prevailing political views was favorable to St. Michael's Cathedral; the Chinese government funded the cathedral's restoration efforts.<ref name="chinaculture.org" /> New crosses were manufactured for the cathedral's restoration,<ref name="88gogo" /><ref name="mafengwo" /><ref name="Qingdao News" /> and "after several years of repair, [the cathedral] was re-opened in April 1981"<ref name="sign">{{Cite sign |title=St. Michael's Cathedral|medium=Sign|distributor=Roman Catholic Church|location=St. Michael's Cathedral Courtyard, Qingdao}}</ref> for religious services.

They are currently stored in the north [[transept]]. The cathedral has been listed on the register of Provincial Historic Buildings by the government of Shandong Province since 1992.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Flath |first1=James |year=2002 |title=Managing Historical Capital in Shandong: Museum, Monument, and Memory in Provincial China |journal=The Public Historian |publisher=UC Press |volume=24 |issue=2 |doi=10.1525/tph.2002.24.2.41 }}</ref></p>

The change in prevailing political views also allowed for rapprochement with Chinese clergy formerly imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution. In 1985 Li Mingshu was allowed an official post teaching at the seminary of Jinan. In 1994 he was transferred to the service of the Diocese of Qingdao, and was appointed the Bishop of Qingdao in 2000. Upon his consecration as Bishop, he took the name "Joseph".<ref name="Li" />

The cathedral stands atop a hill in the center of what was the original settlement of the city of Qingdao, at 15 Zhejiang Road (formerly Bremen Strasse<ref name="Old Qingdao" />) on the east side of Zhongshan Road in Shinan District. The church is built in the historic style of German Romanesque. It is [[cruciform]] in plan, having a nave flanked by a lower single aisle on either side, crossed by a transept, and with a semi-circular apse projecting at the east end. 

The cathedral is {{convert|65.9|m|ft}} long and the transept is {{convert|37.6|m|ft|adj=on}} wide, with an exterior height of {{convert|18|m|ft}}.

In his book, ''German Architecture in China'', Warner Torsten writes of the cathedral: {{quote|[According to residents] the cathedral is far too large for the scale of Qingdao. Its position on top of a hill makes this even more evident. Perhaps the idea was to produce a powerful building to hold its own with the Protestant Church, which for 20 years had been the largest religious building in Qingdao, or perhaps the intention was to outstrip the 46&nbsp;metre-high towers of the Franciscan church in Jinan. The towers of the cathedral in Qingdao were higher than all the other churches in the major cities of Northern China <U+2013> [[Tianjin]], Beijing, [[Dalian]], or [[Jinan]]. They dominate the silhouette of Qingdao; they are particularly impressive from a ship entering the harbour.<ref name="Warner">Warner Torsten, ''German Architecture in China: Architectural Transfer'' </ref>}}

===Interior===
[[File:St Michaels Cathedral Qingdao Interior.jpg|thumb|alt:The sanctuary of a cathedral. On a raised dais, the low altar stands, flanked by Christmas trees. Behind it, the high altar is visible, with the tabernacle on it. A ciborium is over the high altar, directly under an arch with a domed apse behind it.|Sanctuary of St. Michael's Cathedral, decorated for Christmas]]

The total floor area of St. Michael's Cathedral is {{convert|2740|m2|sqft}}.<ref name="chinaculture.org" /> While the exterior of the cathedral is neo-Romanesque, the interior has [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and [[arch]]es of a [[Classical revival]] style. Above the {{convert|12|m|ft|adj=on}} high nave and transept is an unvaulted [[Coffer|coffered ceiling]]. Narrow vaults over the two aisles are so much lower than the nave that they function like [[ambulatory|ambulatories]].<ref name="Warner" /><ref name="Old Qingdao" /> The nave can hold 1,000 people.<ref name="{{lang|zh|<U+9752><U+5C9B><U+4F18><U+79C0><U+5EFA><U+7B51>}}" /> The [[baptismal font]] and statues have captions in English and Chinese.<ref name="LP" />

The nave extends into a high vaulted [[apse]] (pictured right) at the [[Architectural development of the eastern end of cathedrals in England and France|east end]]. The aisles on either side of the nave are continued around the apse, making an ambulatory. Seven chandeliers are suspended from the ceiling over the the main aisle.<ref name="88gogo" /> Beneath the chancel arch stands the high altar, under an ornate [[baldachin]]. The [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]] over the high altar bears the Latin words ''VENITE ADOREMUS DOMINUM'',<ref name="Interior1" /> "Come adore the Lord." Within the sanctuary stands a second, portable, altar, upon which most masses are celebrated.

According to [[Lonely Planet]], "The interior is splendid, with white walls, gold piping...and a marvellously painted apse."<ref name="LP" />

In 2006, the construction and installation of a massive {{convert|12|x|12|m|ft|adj=on}} J<U+00E4>ger & Brommer pipe organ (pictured at left) was commissioned for St. Michael's Cathedral at a cost of 700,000 euros, to be ready in time for the [[2008 Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=58239&sid=16635739&con_type=1 |title=Most-loved Yuletide melody in spotlight |author=Pang, Damon |date=2007-12-07 |publisher=The Standard |accessdate=January 2, 2010}}</ref> The pipe organ sits upon the choir loft over the [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe#West front|west front]] entrance.<ref name="Old Qingdao" />

==Services==
The church is active and as of 2008 more than 10,000 Catholics in Qingdao attend services there.<ref name="CCTV" /> According to December 2009 and January 2010 church bulletins, mass is celebrated daily by Bishop Li Mingshu at 6&nbsp;am, with additional masses on Sunday and festivals on Easter and Christmas. Services are held in Korean and Chinese, with one Korean and several Chinese priests on site.<ref>St. Michael's Cathedral. December 25, 2009. Church Bulletin.</ref><ref>St. Michael's Cathedral.
