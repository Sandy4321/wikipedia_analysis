In 2009, the Gwawaenuk collaborated on a local pilot project to fight [[diabetes]], called "Diabetes and My Nation," which proved to be unusually successful, according to a report at the World Diabetes Congress in Montreal. The program coupled education on medical checkups and healthy eating, including traditional foods, with community events promoting physical activity, such as a "young warriors program that had youth build and race a canoe."<ref>{{Cite news
