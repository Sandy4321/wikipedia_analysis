==Biography==
===Early years (1840&ndash;1869)===
Lemoine was born in [[Quimper, Finist<U+00E8>re|Quimper]], [[France]], on [[November 22]] [[1840]]; the son of a retired military captain who had participated in the campaigns of the [[First French Empire]] occurring after 1807. He attended the [[Prytan<U+00E9>e National Militaire|military Prytan<U+00E9>e]] of [[La Fl<U+00E8>che]] as a child on a scholarship granted because his father had helped found the school.<ref name="amm">{{cite journal| last = Smith| first = David Eugene| title = Biography of <U+00C9>mile-Michel-Hyacinthe Lemoine| magazine = American Mathematics Monthly| year = 1896| volume = 3| pages = 29<U+2013>33|publisher=Mathematical Association of America}}</ref> During this period, he published an article in the local journal, ''Nouvelles annales de math<U+00E9>matiques'', discussing properties of the triangle.<ref name="amm">{{cite journal| last = Smith| first = David Eugene| title = Biography of <U+00C9>mile-Michel-Hyacinthe Lemoine| magazine = American Mathematics Monthly| year = 1896| volume = 3| pages = 29<U+2013>33|publisher=Mathematical Association of America}}</ref> 

Lemoine was accepted into the [[<U+00C9>cole Polytechnique]] in Paris at the age of twenty, the same year as his father's death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polytechnique.edu/page.php?MID=28|title=<U+00C9>cole Polytechnique - 208 years of history|accessdate=2008-03-21|publisher=<U+00C9>cole Polytechnique}}</ref> As a student there, Lemoine, a [[trumpet]] player, helped found an amateur musical group called La Trompette, for which [[Camille Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns]] composed several pieces. After graduation in 1860, he considered a career in law, but was discouraged by the fact that his advocacy for [[republicanism|republican]] ideology and [[liberal religion|liberal religious]] views clashed with the ideals of the incumbent government, the [[Second French Empire]].<ref name="amm">{{cite journal| last = Smith| first = David Eugene| title = Biography of <U+00C9>mile-Michel-Hyacinthe Lemoine| magazine = American Mathematics Monthly| year = 1896| volume = 3| pages = 29<U+2013>33|publisher=Mathematical Association of America}}</ref> Instead, he studied and taught at various institutions during this period, studying under J. Kioes at the [[<U+00C9>cole Sp<U+00E9>ciale d'Architecture|<U+00C9>cole d'Architecture]] and the [[<U+00C9>cole nationale sup<U+00E9>rieure des mines de Paris|<U+00C9>cole des Mines]], teaching Uwe Jannsen at the same schools, and studying under [[Charles-Adolphe Wurtz]] at the [[<U+00C9>cole des Beaux-Arts|<U+00C9>cole des Beaux Arts]] and the <U+00C9>cole de M<U+00E9>decine. Lemoine also lectured at various science institutions in Paris and taught as a private tutor for a period before being appointed professor at the <U+00C9>cole Polytechnique.<ref name="bio2">{{cite web|url=http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/bstud/lemoine.html|title=<U+00C9>mile Michel Hyacinthe Lemoine (1840<U+2013>1912), geometer|accessdate=2008-02-25|author=Kimberling, Clark|publisher=University of Evansville}}</ref>

===Middle years (1870&ndash;1894)===
[[Image:Ecole Polytechnique France seen from lake DSC03389.JPG|thumb|right|The [[<U+00C9>cole Polytechnique]], one of France's most prestigious school]]
In 1870, a [[larynx|laryngeal]] disease forced him to discontinue his teaching. He took a brief vacation in [[Grenoble]] and, when he returned to Paris, turned to publishing his mathematical research. He also participated and founded several scientific societies and journals, such as the ''[[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Math<U+00E9>matique de France]]'', the ''Journal de Physique'', and the ''Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> de Physique'', all in 1871.<ref name="amm">{{cite journal| last = Smith| first = David Eugene| title = Biography of <U+00C9>mile-Michel-Hyacinthe Lemoine| magazine = American Mathematics Monthly| year = 1896| volume = 3| pages = 29<U+2013>33|publisher=Mathematical Association of America}}</ref> 

Lemoine was a founding member of the ''Association Fran<U+00E7>aise pour l'Avancement des Sciences'' and presented there, for it's 1873 meeting in [[Lyon]], his best known paper. This treatise on triangle geometry proved the [[concurrent lines|concurrency]] of the [[symmedian]]s of a triangle. The point of concurrency is known today as the Lemoine point, Grebe point, or the symmedian point.<ref name="gentry">{{cite journal| last = Gentry| first = F.C.| title = Analytic Geometry of the Triangle| year = 1941| volume = 16| issue = 3| magazine = National Mathematics Magazine| month = December| pages = 127<U+2013>40|publisher=Mathematical Association of America}}</ref> Other results in the paper involved the ratio of the division of the sides and the [[concyclic points|concyclicity]] of several points of intersection.<ref name="mainbio">{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Lemoine.html|title=<U+00C9>mile Michel Hyacinthe Lemoine|accessdate=2008-02-26|author=O'Connor, J.J.; Robertson, E.F |publisher=MacTutor}}</ref>

Later, Lemoine wrote a treatise concerning [[compass and straightedge constructions]] entitled ''La g<U+00E9>om<U+00E9>trographie ou l'art des constructions g<U+00E9>om<U+00E9>triques'', which he considered his greatest work despite the fact that it was not well-received. The original title was ''De la mesure de la simplicit<U+00E9> dans les sciences math<U+00E9>matiques'', and the original idea for the text would have discussed the concepts Lemoine devised as concerning the entirety of mathematics. Time constraints, however, limited the scope of the paper.<ref name="amm">{{cite journal| last = Smith| first = David Eugene| title = Biography of <U+00C9>mile-Michel-Hyacinthe Lemoine| magazine = American Mathematics Monthly| year = 1896| volume = 3| pages = 29<U+2013>33|publisher=Mathematical Association of America}}</ref> Instead of the original idea, Lemoine proposed a simplification of the construction process to a number of basic operations with the compass and straightedge, and to measure every construction's "simplicity" by the number of iterations of these operations that were necessary to perform the construction.<ref>{{cite book| last = Greitzer| first = S.L.| title = Dictionary of Scientific Biography| city = New York| year = 1970|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons}}</ref> He presented this paper at a meeting of the ''Association Fran<U+00E7>aise'' in [[Oran]], [[Algeria]] in 1888. The paper, however, did not garner much enthusiasm or interest among the mathematicians gathered there.<ref>{{cite book|last = Coolidge| first = Julian L.| title = A History of Geometrical Methods| city = Oxford| year = 1980| page = 58|publisher=Dover Publications}}</ref>

Lemoine published several other papers on his construction system that same year, including ''Sur la mesure de la simplicit<U+00E9> dans les constructions g<U+00E9>om<U+00E9>triques'' in the ''Comptes rendus'' of the [[Acad<U+00E9>mie fran<U+00E7>aise]]. He published additional papers on the subject in ''Mathesis'' (1888), ''Journal des math<U+00E9>matiques <U+00E9>l<U+00E9>mentaires'' (1889), ''Nouvelles annales de math<U+00E9>matiques'' (1892), and the self-published ''La g<U+00E9>om<U+00E9>trographie ou l'art des constructions g<U+00E9>om<U+00E9>triques'', which was presented at the meeting of the ''Association Fran<U+00E7>aise'' in [[Pau, Pyr<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>es-Atlantiques|Pau]] (1892), and again at [[Besan<U+00E7>on]] (1893) and [[Caen]] (1894).<ref name="amm">{{cite journal| last = Smith| first = David Eugene| title = Biography of <U+00C9>mile-Michel-Hyacinthe Lemoine| magazine = American Mathematics Monthly| year = 1896| volume = 3| pages = 29<U+2013>33|publisher=Mathematical Association of America}}</ref>

===Later years (1895&ndash;1912)===
Lemoine served in the French military for a time in the years following the publishing of his best known papers. He was discharged during a [[communes of France|commune]], and afterwards took up various [[civil engineer]]ing-related jobs in the city of Paris.<ref name="amm">{{cite journal| last = Smith| first = David Eugene| title = Biography of <U+00C9>mile-Michel-Hyacinthe Lemoine| magazine = American Mathematics Monthly| year = 1896| volume = 3| pages = 29<U+2013>33|publisher=Mathematical Association of America}}</ref> In this career, he rose to the rank of chief inspector, a position he held until 1896. As the chief inspector, he was responsible for the gas supply of the city.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Weisse| first = K.| coauthors = P.

Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Univ. Math.-Natur. Reihe| pages = 73&ndash;4| year = 1989| issue = 4| language = German}}</ref> During this time, he published additional notable papers, including a series on what he called ''transformation continue'', which related mathematical equations to geometrical objects such as the triangle and [[tetrahedron]]. The papers on this subject were ''Sur les transformations syst<U+00E9>matiques des formules relatives au triangle'' (1891), ''<U+00C9>tude sur une nouvelle transformation continue'' (1891), ''Une r<U+00E8>gle d'analogies dans le triangle et la sp<U+00E9>cification de certaines analogies <U+00E0> une transformation dite transformation continue'' (1893), and ''Applications au t<U+00E9>tra<U+00E8>dre de la transformation continue'' (1894).<ref name="amm">{{cite journal| last = Smith| first = David Eugene| title = Biography of <U+00C9>mile-Michel-Hyacinthe Lemoine| magazine = American Mathematics Monthly| year = 1896| volume = 3| pages = 29<U+2013>33|publisher=Mathematical Association of America}}</ref>

In 1894, Lemoine co-founded a mathematical journal entitled ''L'interm<U+00E9>diaire des math<U+00E9>maticiens'' along with [[Charles Laisant]], a friend met at the <U+00C9>cole Polytechnique. Lemoine had been planning such a journal since early 1893, but thought that he was too busy to create it. At a dinner with Laisant in March 1893, he suggested the idea of the journal. Laisant cajoled him to create the journal, and so they approached the publisher Gauthier-Villars, which published the first issue in January 1894. Lemoine served as the journal's first editor, and held the position for several years. The year after the journal's initial publication, he retired from mathematical research, but continued to support the subject.<ref name="gentry">{{cite journal| last = Gentry| first = F.C.| title = Analytic Geometry of the Triangle| year = 1941| volume = 16| issue = 3| magazine = National Mathematics Magazine| month = December| pages = 127&ndash;40||publisher=Mathematical Association of America}}</ref> Lemoine died on [[February 21]], [[1912]], in his home city of Paris.<ref name="mainbio">{{cite web |url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Lemoine.html |title=<U+00C9>mile Michel Hyacinthe Lemoine |accessdate=2008-02-26|author=J.J.

==Contributions==
Contemporary mathematician Nathan Court wrote that Lemoine, along with [[Henri Brocard]] and Joseph Neuberg, was one of the three co-founders of modern [[triangle geometry]].<ref name="founder"/> The ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'', in which much of Lemoine's work is published, declared that "To none of these [geometers] more than <U+00C9>mile-Michel-Hyacinthe Lemoine is due the honor of starting this movement [of modern triangle geometry]..."<ref name="amm">{{cite journal| last = Smith| first = David Eugene| title = Biography of <U+00C9>mile-Michel-Hyacinthe Lemoine| magazine = American Mathematics Monthly| year = 1896| volume = 3| pages = 29<U+2013>33|publisher=Mathematical Association of America}}</ref> At the annual meeting of the [[University of Paris|Paris Academy of Sciences]] in 1902, Lemoine was awarded the 1,000-[[franc]] Franc<U+0153>ur prize.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Disseminate|page=273|url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?handle=euclid.bams/1183417334&view=body&content-type=pdf_1|publisher=American Mathematical Society|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume=9|issue=5|year=1903}}</ref><ref>Lemoine, <U+00C9>mile.

===Lemoine point and circle===
[[Image:Symmedians.png|thumb|right|300px|The Lemoine point, ''L''. The green lines are symmedians, the blue lines medians, and the red lines angle bisectors.]]
In his 1873 paper, entitled ''Sur quelques propri<U+00E9>t<U+00E9>s d'un point remarquable du triangle'', Lemoine proved the concurrency of the [[symmedian]]s of a triangle; the reflections of the [[median (geometry)|median]]s of the triangle over the [[angle bisector]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bell |first=Robert  |title=Proceedings of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society |edition=1 |volume=48 |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge }}</ref>  Other results in the paper included the idea that the symmedian from a [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] of the triangle divides the opposite side into segments whose ratio is equal to the ratio of the squares of the other two sides. 

Lemoine also proved that if lines are drawn through the Lemoine point [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the sides of the triangle, then the six points of intersection of the lines and the sides of the triangle are [[concyclic]], or that they lie on a circle. This circle is now known as the first [[Lemoine circle]], or simply the Lemoine circle.<ref name="mainbio">{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Lemoine.html|title=<U+00C9>mile Michel Hyacinthe Lemoine|accessdate=2008-02-26|author=J.J. O'Connor and E.F. Robertson|publisher=MacTutor}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=An Elementary Treatise on Modern Pure Geometry|last=Lachlan|first=Robert|publisher=Cornell University Library|date=1893-01-01|isbn=978-1429700504}}</ref>

===Construction system===
Lemoine's system of constructions, the ''g<U+00E9>om<U+00E9>trographie'', allowed five basic geometric operations: placing a [[Compass (drafting)|compass]]'s end on a given [[point (geometry)|point]], placing it on a given [[line]], drawing a [[circle]] with the compass, placing a straightedge on a given line, and extending a line with the straightedge. Note that drawing a line in an empty plane is possible using this system, as it is simply extending a line of length zero. Drawing a point is not necessary, as a point is merely a location in the plane.<ref>Lemoine, <U+00C9>mile. ''La g<U+00E9>om<U+00E9>trographie ou l'art des constructions g<U+00E9>om<U+00E9>triques''. (1903), Scientia, Paris (in French)</ref>

The "simplicity" of a construction was measured by the number of its operations. In his paper, he discussed as an example the [[Apollonius problem]] originally posed by [[Apollonius of Perga]] during the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellinistic period]]; the method of constructing a circle [[tangent]] to three given circles. The problem was already solved by [[Joseph Diaz Gergonne]] in 1816 with a construction of simplicity 400, but Lemoine's presented solution had simplicity 199.<ref name="mainbio">{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Lemoine.html|title=<U+00C9>mile Michel Hyacinthe Lemoine|accessdate=2008-02-26|author=J.J. O'Connor and E.F. Robertson|publisher=MacTutor}}</ref><ref>[[Eric W. Weisstein]] ''CRC Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics'' (CRC Press, 1999), 733<U+2013>4.</ref> Simpler solutions such as those by [[Frederick Soddy]] in 1936 and by [[David Eppstein]] in 2001 are now known to exist.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ajur.uni.edu/v3n1/Gisch%20and%20Ribando.pdf|date=2004-02-29|accessdate=2008-04-16|coauthors=David Gisch and Jason M. Ribando|publisher=University of Northern Iowa|title=Apollonius<U+2019> Problem: A Study of Solutions and Their Connections|journal=American Journal of Undergraduate Research|volume=3|number=1}}</ref>

===Lemoine's conjecture===
In 1894, Lemoine made a conjecture concerning [[prime number|prime]]s known as Lemoine's conjecture: Every [[odd number]] which is [[inequality|greater than or equal to]] seven can be expressed in the form of ''2p+q'' where ''p'' and ''q'' are prime.<ref>{{cite book|first=Leonard E.|last=Dickson|title=History of the Theory of Numbers|volumes=4|volume=I|page=424}}</ref> In 1985, John Kiltinen and Peter Young conjectured an extension of the conjecture which they called the "refined Lemoine conjecture". They published the conjecture in a journal of the [[Mathematical Association of America]]:  "For any odd number ''m'' which is greater than or equal to nine, there are odd prime numbers ''p'', ''q'', ''r'' and ''s'' and [[positive integer]]s ''j'' and ''k'' such that ''m=2p+q'', ''2+pq=2<sup>j</sup>+r'' and ''2q+p=2<sup>k</sup>+s''. [...] The study has directed our attention to more subtle aspects of the additive theory of prime numbers. Our conjecture reflects this, dealing with interactions of sums involving primes whereas [[Goldbach's conjecture]] and Lemoine's conjecture deal with such sums only individually. This conjecture and the open questions about numbers at levels two and three are of interest in their own right because of the issues they raise within this fascinating and often baffling additive realm of the prime numbers."<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Mathematics Magazine|year=1984|coauthors=John Kiltinen and Peter Young|month=September|title=Goldbach, Lemoine, and a Know/Don't Know Problem|volume=48|number=4|pages=195&ndash;203|publisher=Mathematical Association of America}}</ref>

==Role in modern triangle geometry==
Lemoine has been described as a co-founder of modern triangle geometry, a term used by several mathematical associations such as the [[Mathematical Association of America]] and the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref name="founder"/> In this context, "modern" is used to refer to geometry developed from the late 18th century onward.<ref name="gallatly" /> Such geometry relies on abstraction of figures in the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] rather than the [[analytic geometry|analytic]] methods used earlier involving specific [[angle]] measures and [[distance]]s. The geometry focuses on topics such as [[line (mathematics)|collinearity]], [[concurrent lines|concurrency]], and [[cyclic points|concyclicity]], as they do not involve the measures listed previously.<ref>Steve Sigur (1999). [http://www.paideiaschool.org/Teacherpages/Steve_Sigur/resources/modern%20geo%20of%20triangle.pdf The Modern Geometry of the Triangle]. Retrieved on 2008-[[April 16|04-16]].</ref>

Lemoine's work defined the many of the noted traits of this movement. His abstract ''g<U+00E9>om<U+00E9>trographie'' and relation of equations to tetrahedrons and triangles, as well as his study of concurrencies and concyclities, contributed to the modern triangle geometry of the time. The defining of abstract points in relation to a triangle, as with the Lemoine point, was also a staple of the geometry, and other modern triangle geometers such as Henri Brocard and [[Gaston Tarry]] wrote about similar points.<ref name="gallatly">{{cite book|title=The Modern Geometry of the Triangle|first=William|last=Gallatly|pages=79|publisher=Scholarly Publishing Office|year=2005|month=December |isbn=978-1418178451}}</ref>
