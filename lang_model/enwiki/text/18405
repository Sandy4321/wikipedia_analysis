==History==

The church was built between 1821 and 1826.  The architect [[John Soane|Sir&nbsp;John Soane]] was invited to design the church to accommodate about 1,800&nbsp;people, and to cost no more than <U+00A3>12,000.  He declined and passed the commission to [[Charles Barry]].<ref name=hist1>{{Citation | url = http://www.allsaintsmanchester.org/history1819-25.htm| title = History 1819<U+2013>25| accessdate = 15&nbsp;December 2011| publisher = Parish Church of All Saints, Stand}}</ref>  This church was Barry's first commission.<ref name=pev/><ref name=nhl/>  Its design was similar to his design for St Matthew, Campfield.

==Architecture==
===Exterior===
All Saints is constructed in [[millstone grit]] from the [[Pennines]].<ref name=hist2>{{Citation | url = http://www.allsaintsmanchester.org/history%201826%20on.htm| title = History 1826 on| accessdate = 15&nbsp;December 2011| publisher = Parish Church of All Saints, Stand}}</ref>  The architectural style is described as "fanciful" [[English Gothic architecture|Gothic]].<ref name=pev/><ref name=nhl/>{{ref label|Location|B|B}}  The plan of the church is rectangular in five [[bay (architecture)|bays]], with a [[Cant (architecture)|canted]] [[apse]] at the east end, and a west porch and tower.  The lowest stage of the tower forms the porch, which is entered through tall narrow pointed arches.  The bell openings are pairs of [[lancet window|lancet]]s.  Along the sides of the church are two tiers of windows.  The tower and the body of the church have [[battlement|embattled]] [[parapet]]s and [[crocket]]ed [[pinnacle]]s.<ref name=nhl/>

===Interior===
Inside the church are galleries on three sides carried on slender [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]] [[pier (architecture)|piers]].  The plaster ceilings are [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]].  The altar, screen and [[pulpit]] date from 1921, the choir stalls and side screens date from 1937; all of these were designed by the [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] architects [[Sharpe, Paley and Austin#Austin and Paley (1925<U+2013>1944)|Austin and Paley]].  The stained glass in the east window dates from 1841 and is by D.&nbsp;Evans of [[Shrewsbury]].  Elsewhere are windows by [[Lavers, Barraud and Westlake]], and by [[A. L. Moore|A.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;Moore]], the latter dating from 1921.  The monuments include one by [[Robert William Sievier|Sievier]] dating from 1826 depicting a lady lying on a ''[[chaise longue]]''.<ref name=pev/>  The original organ was built by [[Samuel Renn]] in 1827 and situated in the west gallery.  It was moved in 1880 to the north aisle.  This organ was removed from the church in 1957.<ref name=hist2/>  It was replaced by the present three [[manual (music)|manual]] organ made by Charles A.&nbsp;Smethurst.  This organ was rebuilt in 1997 by Nicholson of [[Worcester]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=R00073| title = Lancashire (Manchester, Greater), Stand, All Saints (R00073)| accessdate = 15&nbsp;December 2011| publisher = [[British Institute of Organ Studies]]}}</ref>  The [[ring of bells|ring]] consists of eight bells, all of which were cast in 1912 by [[Gillett & Johnston|Gillett and Johnston]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=whitefield&Submit=+Go+&DoveID=STAND| title = Stand, Whitefield, All Saints| accessdate = 15&nbsp;December 2011| publisher = [[Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers]]}}</ref>

==Notes==
{{note label|Location|A|A}}In some cases, as in this one, the size of the grant was greater than the actual construction cost (as shown in the infobox) because it also included contributions towards the cost of the site, legal fees, etc.<ref name=port/><br>
{{note label|Location|B|B}}The term fanciful in this context means that although the design was loosely based on Gothic features, these were not accurate reproductions of Gothic features.<ref name=pev/><ref>{{Citation | last = Price| first = James| author-link = | publication-date = | date = | year = 1998| title = Sharpe, Paley and Austin: A Lancaster Architectural Practice 1836<U+2013>1942| publication-place = Lancaster| place = | publisher = Centre for North-West Regional Studies| pages = 38<U+2013>39| page = | id = | isbn = 1-86220-054-8| doi = | oclc = }}</ref>
