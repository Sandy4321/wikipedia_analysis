'''Robert Lindblom Math & Science Academy''' is a [[Public school (government funded)|public]] [[Secondary school|secondary]] school which is part of the [[Chicago Public School]] system.  It is a selective enrollment, [[university-preparatory school|university-preparatory]] high school in the [[West Englewood]] neighborhood of Chicago. The school, originally named ''Lindblom Technical High School'' is named for Robert Lindblom, a nineteenth century Swedish<U+2013>born trader on the [[Chicago Board of Trade]].

==History==
Lindblom Technical High School was completed in 1919 and was designed by architect Arthur Hussander.<ref>City of Chicago Department of Community Development, Lindblom High School proposed for landmark status, Available online at http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/webportal/portalContentItemAction.do?blockName=Planning+And+Development%2fI+Want+To&deptMainCategoryOID=&channelId=0&programId=0&entityName=Planning+And+Development&topChannelName=Dept&contentOID=537022695&Failed_Reason=Invalid+timestamp,+engine+has+been+restarted&contenTypeName=COC_EDITORIAL&com.broadvision.session.new=Yes&Failed_Page=%2fwebportal%2fportalContentItemAction.do&context=dept</ref>

==The Building==
Lindblom Technical High School was built prior to 1919 and was designed in a [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style and has a neo-classical facade with Roman columns. Within the building is a 2,000 seat auditorium with 2 balconies, 2 gymnasiums, a large study hall/ballroom on the third floor with a barrel-vaulted ceiling and large skylights, a swimming pool, and a greenhouse. Lindblom also has [[Access Community Health Network|Access]], a community health network located inside of lindblom for students and the community.

The "Seven Pilars"
The seven pilars that are placed in front of the school were condensed from the 144 "Rules of Conduct" written by the class of 2009 on August 30, 2009. This was established  in order to remind students what is expected from them by attending Lindblom. Each of the seven pilars represent the following :

1) We will set realistic goals and will "begin with the end in mind" ([[7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens]], Sean Covey).We will keep track of our progress and seek help as soon as it is neeeded. We will be determined to stay focused until our goals are achieved.

2) We will come to school on time and be prepared for all class and colloquia.

3)When involved in group projects, each will do his /her part and will speak audibly and effectively to enhance peer understanding.

4)We will help others who struggle and will be respectful of their needs. We will be positive, considerate, and open-minded as we interact with staff and students.

5)We will believe in ourselves and each other.

6) We will take an initiative and responsibility for a clean campus environment.

7) We will pursue success with a positive attitude and with a willingness to help and encourage others.

In 2003, Lindblom underwent a 2-year, $42 million renovation. BauerLatoza Studio was hired by Chicago Public Schools to develop the entire project, that consisted of modernized forms of architecture, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems. BauerLatoza Studio had also designed brand new computer and science labs throughout the building.<ref>http://www.bauerlatozastudio.com/hp-proj5.shtm</ref> The grand reopening was held by the Lindblom Alumni Association and the Board of Education on October 14, 2005. The occasion featured alumna [[Cheryl Burton]], as the Mistress of Ceremonies.

The school reopened in the fall of 2005 as Lindblom Math & Science Academy welcoming its first class of freshmen along with the final class of Lindblom College Prep High School graduating in spring of 2006.

In December, 2008, Lindblom received preliminary landmark status from the Commission on Chicago Landmarks <ref>City of Chicago, "Lindblom High School proposed for landmark status", December 4, 2008</ref>.  In June 2010, the [[Chicago City Council]]'s Landmarks Committee approved the designation of the school as a city landmark, citing ''<U+201C>distinctive and exceptional example<U+201D> of the Beaux Arts Style of architecture <U+201C>with its monumental classical fa<U+00E7>ade, light-colored masonry and symmetry.<U+201D>''<ref>{{Citation| last = Spielman| first = Fran| title = Lindblom High in Englewood declared landmark| newspaper = Chicago Sun-Times| pages = | year = 2010| date = 3 June| url = http://www.suntimes.com/news/cityhall/2352040,lindblom-made-landmark--060310.article| accessdate =4 June 2010| quote = Lindblom Technical High School and its most striking  interior elements <U+2014> the front-entrance vestibule, auditorium and study hall with its barrel vaulted ceiling <U+2014> are about to become Chicago landmarks.  The City Council<U+2019>s Landmarks Committee approved the designation Thursday after being told the 91-year-old school that occupies an entire West Englewood block is a <U+201C>distinctive and exceptional example<U+201D> of the Beaux Arts Style of architecture <U+201C>with its monumental classical fa<U+00E7>ade, light-colored masonry and symmetry.<U+201D>}}</ref>

===Colloquium===
Colloquium is a mini-course that meets for three hours a day during every five day week. There are two areas of focus:
1) '''Rare engaging opportunities in math and science education'''
We are a math and science school. For us, it means offering courses that are unique to any school.

2)'''Services to Englewood Community'''
The second group of offerings focuses on our service to the community in which we reside. We work throughcommunity organizations to provide service that the community has identified.Our service opportunity bring real academic skills to their views of service.

===Partnership with Baxter===
In October, 2008 Lindblom became partners with [[Baxter International]] as part of their SCIENCE@WORK initiative.<ref>Baxter International, "Chicago Public Schools Receive Major Corporate Donation for Science Education", Available online at http://www.baxter.com/about_baxter/press_room/press_releases/2008/10_23_08_science_at_work.html, Cited September 15, 2009</ref>

The objective of the Baxter Initiative is twofold. First, Baxter is provided support for Lindblom's biotechnology courses. The second was the creation of the teacher professional development program, the Biotechnology Center of Excellence. Teachers from other Chicago high schools can attend professional development at Lindblom in order to create their own biotechnology programs. The initiative also provides support for Chicago's Renaissance 2010 program and the Illinois Institute of Technology<U+2019>s (IIT) Instructional Development System.<ref>Ibid</ref>

==Schedule==
Lindblom Math & Science Academy is on a block schedule. Students have four classes per day:Three that last 100 minutes; one that lasts 50, and one 50 minute lunch period. This allows us to focus on depth over breadth. 100-minute classes meet two days a week and 50 minute classes meet four. The school also offers Advanced Placement (AP) courses, where students can earn college credit after the completion of the course and an AP exam at the end of the school year.

Lindblom operates on the year round schedule. Instead of the traditional 12 week break in the summer, students are out of school for the months of June, November, and March. The winter break is the same as all other schools in the CPS system. The spring break is included in the march break. There are three trimesters instead of four quarters, that occur in between each intersesion.

==Student life==
===Activities===
The Lindblom Debate Team competes in the [[Chicago Debate League]] at both the high school and middle school levels.

===Athletics===
Lindblom features a variety of sports, including football, basketball, baseball, softball, soccer, water polo, volleyball, cross country/track, swimming, golf, and bowling.  In the 2008-2009 school year, LMSA started its first Girls' Swim Team, and Boys' Swim Team.  That same year, Lindblom started its Water polo team. The Girls' Swim Team won the conference championship in the 2010-2011 school year.

==Security==
Lindblom has a shuttle bus service before and after school that goes to the orange, red, and green lines. The bus picks students up from the train stations and also accommodates sports teams.
