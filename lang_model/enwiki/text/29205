'''''Diy<U+0101>r Mudar''''' ("abode of [[Mudar]]") is the medieval [[Arabic]] name of the westernmost of the three provinces of the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] (Upper [[Mesopotamia]]), the other two being [[Diyar Bakr]] and [[Diyar Rabi'a]]. According to [[al-Baladhuri]], all three provinces were named after the main Arab tribes that were settled there by [[Mu'awiyah]] in the course of the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century. The Diyar Mudar was settled by the [[Mudar]] tribe.

Diyar Mudar encompasses the region on both banks of the middle course of the river [[Euphrates]], from the area of [[Samosata]] to the town of [[Anah]], and includes the are of the river [[Balikh]] and the lower reaches of the river [[Khabur]]. Its main city was [[al-Raqqah]] (Amid in Arabic), and other major settlements included [[Harran]], [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] (al-Ruha in Arabic), and [[Saruj]]. Geographically and politically, in early Islamic times the Diyar Bakr was usually part of the Jazira. In the mid-10th century, the region came under [[Hamdanid]] control, and under [[Sayf al-Dawla]] it was detached from the Jazira and subordinated to the Syria-based [[Emirate of Aleppo]]. In the same period, the region came under attack by the resurgent [[Byzantine Empire]], who seized Edessa in the 1032. Thereafter the region became divided into a mostly Christian-ruled northern portion, subject to [[Armenians|Armenian]] colonization, and an Arab-influenced south. [[Seluq Turks|Seljuq]] raids began in the 1060s and 1070s, but it was not until 1086 that the Seljuq [[sultan]] [[Malikshah]] unified the province under his control. The advent of the [[Crusades]] re-established the division between a Christian north (the [[County of Edessa]]) and a Muslim south, which lasted until the mid-12th century. The [[Ayyubids]] gained control of the region under [[Saladin]], and kept it until the [[Mongol]] conquest in 1260.
