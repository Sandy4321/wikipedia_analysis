Herbet was arrested together with the ''[[Schutzhaftlagerf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' and the ''[[Kapo (concentration camp)|Lager<U+00E4>ltester]]'' of [[Warsaw concentration camp]] in the wake of a corruption scandal in this concentration camp in the spring of 1944.  They were accused by the prisoners of [[extortion]] of valuables.  All three defendants were detained in [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]].  But, Herbet was soon able to return to the concentration camp service.<ref>Benz, Wolfgang. ''Der Ort des Terrors: Geschichte der nationalsozialistischen Konzentrationslager.'', Vol. 7, p. 101</ref>
