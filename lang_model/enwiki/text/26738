'''USS ''Naubuc'' (YN-109/AN-84/YRST-4)''' was a [[Cohoes-class net laying ship|''Cohoes''-class]] [[net laying ship]] which was assigned to protect [[U.S. Navy]] ships and harbors during [[World War II]] with her anti-[[submarine]] nets. Her World War II career was short due to the war coming to an end, and she was inactivated only to be commissioned again some time later as a [[Ship<U+2019>s tender|tender]] for salvage craft.

==Constructed in Duluth, Minnesota ==
The second ship to be so named by the Navy, ''Naubuc'' (AN<U+2013>84) was laid down [[31 December]] [[1943]] as (''YN<U+2013>109'') by the Marine Iron arid Shipbuilding Co., [[Duluth, Minnesota]]; launched [[15 April]] [[1944]]; sponsored by Mrs. Harold E. Ford; and commissioned [[15 March]] [[1945]], Lt. (jg.) W. M. Bauer in command.
 
==World War II related service ==
Following a delayed [[Shakedown (testing)|shakedown]] off the [[U.S. East Coast]], ''Naubuc'' departed [[Boston, Massachusetts]], [[24 April]] [[1945]], en route to [[California]]. Arriving at [[San Pedro, California]], [[7 June]], she completed intensive net training drills and headed west, anchoring in [[Pearl Harbor]] [[17 July]]. 

By [[1 August]] she was at [[Eniwetok]], whence she continued on to the [[Philippines]], performing her specialized services of laying and tending protective nets around ships arid across harbor entrances at [[Leyte]] until after the cessation of hostilities. Encoute to [[CONUS]] in October, she stopped at [[Kwajalein]] and [[Pearl Harbor]], arriving at [[San Francisco, California]], [[1 December]].
 
On completion of an abbreviated tour in the [[Panama Canal Zone]], ''Naubus'' reported at [[San Diego, California]], [[2 January]] [[1946]], for duty in the [[11th Naval District]]. 

== Post-war inactivation ==
Ordered to [[Seattle, Washington]], for inactivation the following month, she decommissioned and entered the [[19th Fleet]], at [[Astoria, Oregon]], [[6 September]] [[1946]]. She remained in the [[Columbia River]] Group, [[Pacific Reserve Fleet]], until struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] [[1 September]] [[1962]]. She was then transferred to the custody of the [[U.S. Maritime Administration]] and placed in the [[National Defense Reserve Fleet]].
 
==Reinstatement as a tender ==
Reaquired five years later, ''Naubuc'' was reinstated to the Naval Vessel Register [[1 June]] [[1967]] arid scheduled to be converted to a Salvage Craft [[Ship's tender|Tender]]. In March [[1968]] she was reclassified (''ARST<U+2013>4'') and assigned to the [[13th Naval District]] for conversion.

== Final decommissioning ==
On [[1 September]] [[1975]] ''Naubuc'' was struck from the [[Navy list]] and sold.
