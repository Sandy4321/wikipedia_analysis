The '''Buena Vista Palace''' is a 1,014-room resort located on 27 acres directly across from the [[Downtown Disney]] Marketplace.  The 23-acre hotel, which opened in November 1983, is among seven hotels that make up the [[Downtown Disney Resort Area Hotels]].  The Downtown Disney Resort Area Hotels are located on the property of the [[Walt Disney World Resort]] in [[Lake Buena Vista]], [[Florida]], but are not owned by Disney.

== Branding history ==
The Buena Vista Palace Resort & Spa was re-branded and renamed as the Wyndham Palace Resort & Spa in November 1998 (the hotel's owners, who had acquired the hotel a year earlier, had purchased Wyndham earlier in the year).  In 2005, the [[Blackstone Group]] acquired [[Wyndham]] and announced plans to launch a new brand LXR Luxury Resorts.  LXR Luxury Resorts would consist of 21 premium properties wholly owned by the [[Blackstone Group]], including the former Wyndham Palace which reverted back to its original name in 2006.
