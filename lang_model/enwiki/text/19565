'''''A Plumm Summer''''' is a {{fy|2007}} [[Adventure film|adventure]]-[[family film]] directed by Caroline Zelder. It starred Owen Pearce, [[Chris Massoglia]] (appearing under the name "Chris J. Kelly"), Morgan Flynn, [[William Baldwin]], [[Henry Winkler]], and [[Lisa Guerrero]].<ref name="Guerrero" /> The film follows a teenage boy, his young brother, and a new-to-town teenage girl as they try to find a marionette from a local television show which has been stolen and held for ransom. Meanwhile, the brothers' father struggles with alcoholism and their mother tries to hold her marriage together.

==Plot synopsis==
The film is based on a real event that occurred in 1968 in [[Billings, Montana]], the hometown of screenwriter [[T. J. Lynch]].<ref name="Kemmick">[http://www.mtstandard.com/articles/2006/08/26/newsstate/hjjdjbhdjjjafe.txt Kemmick, Ed. "Who Snatched Froggy Doo?

A popular locally-produced children's television show, ''Happy Herb & Froggy Doo,'' features magician Happy Herb (Henry Winkler) and his wisecracking marionette sidekick, Froggy Doo. Froggy Doo is stolen and held for ransom, and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) is called in to investigate. Elliott Plumm (Chris Massoglia) used to watch the show, but now feels he is too grown up to do so any longer. His five-year-old brother, Rocky, is a ''Froggy Doo'' fan, however. Their father, Mick Plumm (William Baldwin), is a recovering alcoholic and unemployed ex-[[boxing|boxer]] who believes Elliott's birth prevented him from going to the [[Olympic Games]] 12 years earlier. Mick's emotionally distant relationship with Elliott is causing Elliott to become emotionally troubled. Their mother, Roxie Plumm (Lisa Guerrero), is the only breadwinner in the family, and keeping her husband sober and attending to her job means she has little time for her children.

Elliott shows little interest in the kidnapping. Shortly thereafter, however, Haley Dubois (Morgan Flynn) and her father arrive in their run-down mobile home and move in next door. Haley's father is the new deputy sheriff in town, and Haley is entranced by the mystery surrounding the kidnapping of Froggy Doo. Elliott quickly begins to fall in love with Haley, and soon he agrees to help Haley and Rocky find Froggy Doo in order to win Haley's heart. The three kids have to find the marionette before the two bumbling FBI agents, Hardigan (Peter Scolari) and Brinkman (Rick Overton) can do so. Elliott, Haley, and Rocky's list of suspects include the local bully, a store clerk, Happy Herb's wife, Viv (Brenda Strong). As the kids pursue the case, Elliott and Rocky's brotherly bond strengthens, and Elliott realizes he might not only win back the love of his father but provide his family with the substantial reward money and help his parents' marriage, too.

==Production==
T.J. Lynch grew up in Billings, where the real-life ''Happy Herb and Froggy Doo'' show originated, and watched the show as a child. Lynch used the kidnapping of Froggy Doo as the basis for a screenplay, and interviewed Herb McAllister (the actor who played Happy Herb and provided Froggy Doo's voice) to gain background information for the script.<ref name="Kidnapping" /> Lynch and McAllister agreed to a contract which gave exclusive story rights to Lynch and permitted the use of the original Froggy Doo character design in the final film.<ref name="Kidnapping" /> Lynch contacted Caroline Zelder, a director/producer friend of his, and Zelder agreed to produce the film.<ref name="Kidnapping" /> Work on the script took roughly two-and-a-half to three years.<ref name="Filming">[http://www.helenair.com/news/state-and-regional/article_21c582f7-1fb9-5b32-9fbf-69a14ec76828.html "'Plumm Summer' Filming to Begin Next Month."] ''Associated Press.''

==Release==
''A Plumm Summer'' screened at a number of film festivals around the world (including the [[Heartland Film Festival]]<ref>[http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?ID=26182 "Film Festival Concludes With 22,000 Attendees."] ''Inside INdiana Business.'' October 30, 2007.</ref> and [[Chicago International Children's Film Festival]]<ref name="First" />) and won several awards,<ref name="Guerrero" /><ref name="Birmingham">[http://www.al.com/entertainment/birminghamnews/index.ssf?/base/entertainment/120911136445020.xml&coll=2 "Birmingham One of 4 Cities to Open Family Film 'Plumm Summer'."] ''[[Birmingham News]].'' April 25, 2008.</ref> but the picture was unable to find a major American studio willing to release the family-friendly film.<ref name="Guerrero" /> Fairplay Pictures eventually self-distributed the picture on 58 screens<ref name="Thin">"'Baby Mama' Legit at the Box Office." ''The Hollywood Reporter.'' April 27, 2008.</ref><ref>"'Baby,' 'Kumar' Vie for Box Office." ''Variety.'' April 24, 2008.</ref> in 10 cities in the United States on April 20, 2008.<ref name="Guerrero" /> Cities in the limited release included [[Minneapolis]]-[[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], and some towns in Montana.<ref name="Curve" /><ref name="NPRRadio" /><ref name="Birmingham" /> The film's opening weekend box office receipts totalled $60,668, a "thin" $1,046 per venue.<ref name="Thin" />

Nonetheless, the self-distribution strategy led several major motion picture companies to express interest in releasing the film on DVD.<ref name="Guerrero" /> [[Paramount Pictures]] won the right to do so,<ref name="Guerrero" /> and released the DVD in North America on May 5, 2009.

A sequel, ''A Plumm Summer Adventure,'' and possibly a third "Plumm" movie were planned.<ref name="NPRRadio" />

==Critical reception==
Critics gave the film very mixed reviews. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote, "This family film is willing to tackle important issues such as burgeoning sexuality, alcoholism and a troubled home life but does so in a bland and unconvincing story."<ref name="Reporter" /> However, the film's technical qualities were praised.<ref name="Reporter" /> Both ''The Hollywood Reporter'' and the ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]'' felt the story was slow and contrived.<ref>"'70s-Style Family Melodrama Offers Hugs But Little Depth." ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]].'' April 25, 2008.</ref> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the film flawed, and placed the blame squarely on the screenplay for not knowing whether to depict a Disney-esque innocent adventure or a real world that confronted a teenager's emerging sexuality, a father's alcoholism, and the break-up of a marriage.<ref>Olsen, Mark. "It's Plum Refreshing, But 'Plumm' Is Flawed Too." ''[[Los Angeles Times]].'' April 28, 2008.</ref> The ''[[Deseret News]]'' called the film "hokey" and felt the direction and some of the performances were amateurish.<ref name="Deseret">[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,700226175,00.html Vice, Jeff. "'A Plumm Summer' Amateurish, Hokey But Not Awful."] ''[[Deseret News]].'' May 15, 2008.</ref> The newspaper labeled the score as "one of the worst musical scores in recent memory", and felt the period songs were "ill-chosen".<ref name="Deseret" /> The ''[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]]'' was particularly harsh in its criticism. The newspaper felt the picture was "insulting to your child's intelligence, veer<nowiki>[ed]</nowiki> wildly between broad humor (and I should mention that there is literally not one funny scene in this whole movie), sugary nostalgia and the worst melodrama", and "fraught with leaden direction and horrible acting".<ref name="Star">Schilling, Peter. "Don't Waste Your Time With 'Plumm Summer'." ''Minneapolis Star Tribune.'' April 24, 2008.</ref>

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave a much more positive review. The industry trade journal called Owen Pearce's performance "scene-stealing," and felt all the performances were "at a very high level across the board."<ref name="Loewenstein">[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117936255.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 Loewenstein, Lael. "'A Plumm Summer'."] ''Variety.'' February 19, 2008.</ref> The magazine also praised Zelder's direction: "<nowiki>[A]</nowiki>ction, comedy and a touch of sweetness ... <nowiki>[are]</nowiki> exactly what distingushes Caroline Zelder's debut feature.... Zelder has a way of imbuing even the smallest gestures -- like a teenager's slump or a 5-year-old's intractable stare -- with meaning."<ref name="Loewenstein" /> ''Variety'' also gave high marks to the film's technical production. "Lenser Mark Vargo bathes the Montana locations in glorious natural light; Alan Muraoka's production design and Nola Roller's costumes mostly nail the 1968 aesthetic, but could have been even more consistent."<ref name="Loewenstein" />
