"'''Showdown'''" is the fourth [[single (music)|single]] and first track from the album ''[[In Silico]]'' by Australian [[drum and bass]] band [[Pendulum (band)|Pendulum]]. It has been remixed by several artists, including DJ Clipz, Excision, and Redlight. It is also the first single taken from ''In Silico'' not to use the album logo prominently on its cover.

The single was originally released through various [[online music store]]s on 5 January 2009. It was not available in any physical format until 9 February, when [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music UK]] released the [[12-inch single|12"]] [[picture disc]] of "Showdown". To help promote the single, Pendulum also released a ''[[Space Invaders]]'' themed video game which offered players a chance of winning an official framed [[gold disc]] of ''In Silico''.<ref name=gold>[[Pendulum (band)|Pendulum]] (24 December 2008).

== Critical reception ==
"Showdown" has received generally positive reviews from music critics. Angry Ape reviewer David Adair described the single as "a snappy and slightly abrasive number that will keep their new found fans amongst the [[Kerrang!|Kerrang]] reading community, very happy".<ref>Adair, David (24 December 2008).

Retrieved on 9 February 2009.</ref> David Knight observed that "you won't hear a better [[riff]] on a [[electronic dance music|dance]] track without a great amount of searching", but described the [[remix]]es released with the single as "absolutely terrible".<ref name=Altsounds /> It was chosen as "Single of the Week" on 12 January by the British [[tabloid]] newspaper ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]''.<ref>James, Sarah-Louise.

== Music video ==
[[File:Pendulum - Showdown Video.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Part of the ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'' style [[stage combat|fight scene]] taken from the "Showdown" music video.]]

The music video for "Showdown", directed by Nick Bartleet, was released on [[MySpaceTV]] on 12 December 2008 to promote Pendulum's upcoming single.<ref>[[Pendulum (band)|Pendulum]] (12 December 2008). [http://www.pendulum.com/news,the-next-single-showdown_19.htm The Next Single: "Showdown"]. Official website. Retrieved on 7 February 2009.</ref> It was originally intended to be Internet-only, but was subsequently A-listed on the television channel [[MTV Dance]].<ref name=Promo>Knight, David.

The video draws parallels from [[dog fighting]], focussing on a [[stage combat|fight scene]] in which the dogs are replaced by two young women, and culminates in the escape of one woman at the end of the video. It also depicts controversial scenes of women being kept in [[cage (enclosure)|cages]] and men [[gambling]] on the outcome of fights, which contributed to Knight describing the video as "highly problematic".<ref name=Promo /> Some scenes of the video have been compared with the movie ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'' by various sources, including Bartleet.<ref name=Promo /><br clear=left />

== Promotional video game ==
[[File:Pendulum Showdown game.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The "Showdown" video game.]]

On 24 December, shortly after the release of their music video, Pendulum presented a ''[[Space Invaders]]'' themed [[video game]] on their website to further promote "Showdown". By scoring more points, players who submitted their details could unlock more of the "Live at the [[Brixton Academy]]" version of "Showdown". They also had a chance of winning an official framed [[gold disc]] of ''[[In Silico]]''.<ref name=gold />

The game was a modified version of ''Space Invaders'', in which the aliens had been replaced with different coloured variants of the ''In Silico'' logo, and the bunkers were replaced with pairs of letters spelling out the band's name. Players had three lives to score as many points as possible, after which their score was logged on a [[high score]] table.<ref>[http://www.rocksound.tv/news/article/pendulum-versus-space-invaders Pendulum Versus Space Invaders]. ''[[Rock Sound|Rock Sound TV]]'' (6 January 2009). Retrieved on 8 February 2009.</ref> The album version of "Showdown" was played during the game.

== Marketing and release ==
"Showdown" was first released on 5 January 2009 through various [[online music store]]s, including [[7digital]], [[Amazon.com]], and [[iTunes Store|iTunes]].<ref name=iTMS>[http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=300058543&s=143444 Pendulum <U+2013> Showdown]. UK [[iTunes Store]]. Retrieved 4 February 2009. '''Note:''' Requires [[iTunes]] software with UK iTunes Store.</ref> Along with the album version and [[radio edit]] of the song, the download bundle included a live recording and several [[remix]]es by other artists. The single was later released on a [[12-inch single|12"]] [[picture disc]], containing the album version and Excision remix of "Showdown", on 9 February by [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music UK]].

The song "Showdown" was featured on ''[[In Silico]]'' as the opening track. It was the first single from the album not to use the ''In Silico'' logo prominently on its [[album cover|cover]], although most of the logo can be seen on a [[bass drum]] in the [[cover art]]. Live versions of the song have appeared on ''iTunes Live: London Festival '08'', as a [[B-side]] on "[[The Other Side (Pendulum song)|The Other Side]]", as well as in the single download bundle. It was also featured in the [[soundtrack]] of [[Disney Interactive Studios]]' off-road racing video game ''[[Pure (video game)|Pure]]''.<ref>[http://uk.music.ign.com/articles/906/906584p1.html Pure to Rock Hard].
