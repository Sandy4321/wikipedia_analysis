'''Eric Radomski''' is a [[Television producer|producer]] most closely linked with [[Warner Bros.]] Animation. He is perhaps best known as co-creator and co-producer of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.

Radomski was working as a background artist on the [[animated series]] ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' when the success of [[Tim Burton]]'s first ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' film prompted Warner Bros. to consider a [[Batman]] animated series. Radomski and character animator [[Bruce Timm]] each separately applied to work on the new series, and were assigned to work together on a short showcase animation, which resulted in them being made producers and put in charge of the series.

Other series Radomski has worked on as a producer include the [[Emmy Award]]-winning ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' and another comic book adaptation, ''[[Spawn (TV series)|Spawn]]'' (for [[HBO]]). He has worked as a Animation Producer for the theatrically released movies ''[[The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys]]'', and ''[[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm]]'' (based on the Animated Series).

==Trivia==

* Radomski came up with the initial innovation that created the overall "look" of [[Batman: The Animated Series]] by ordering that all backgrounds be painted on black paper with lighter colors, instead of using darker colors on white paper as was the industry standard.
