The '''Seven Buildings''' were seven [[townhouse]]s constructed on the northwest corner of [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] NW and 19th Street NW in Washington, D.C., in 1796.<ref>Gutheim, p. 103.</ref> They were some of the earliest residential structures built in the city. One of the Seven Buildings was the home of President [[James Madison]] and his wife [[Dolley Madison|Dolley]], and later the residence of [[Martin Van Buren]] shortly before and after he became President. Most of the buildings were demolished in 1959. The facades of two buildings were incorporated into a modern office building in 1986.

==About the Seven Buildings==
The Residence Act of 1790, which established the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] as the site for the capital of the United States, provided for the appointment of three commissioners by the President (and without the need for Senate confirmation) to govern the District of Columbia, survey its land, purchase property from private landowners, and construct federal buildings.<ref>Pinheiro, p. 212.</ref> On December 24, 1793, [[James Greenleaf]] and [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] purchased 6,000 lots from the commissioners and began marketing them for sale and development.<ref>Abbot, et al., p. 16.</ref> In November 1794, General [[Walter Stewart (general)|Walter Stewart]] purchased the seven lots at  1901 to 1913 Pennsylvania Avenue and constructed seven three-story townhouses on the property.<ref>Bryan, p. 244.</ref> They were not the first residences to be constructed in the District of Columbia.  Many of the residences in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], Hamburgh Village (the current neighborhood of [[Foggy Bottom]]), and on the many farms in what became D.C. preceded them. However, they may have the earliest residential homes to be constructed in the new "Federal City" in the Distric of Columbia.<ref>Webb and Wooldridge, p. 182.</ref> They were certainly among the finest: They were exquisitely detailed, and an ornamental lintel with a sculpted woman's head was above each door.<ref name="Goode">Goode, p. 169.</ref>

1901 Pennsylvania Avenue NW was the most famous of the seven structures. After the [[Burning of Washington]] by British troops in 1814, President James Madison and his wife, Dolley, lived in the building. They were residents there from October 1815 to March 1817 while the [[White House]] was restored.<ref>Haas, p. 30.</ref> It had the nickname of "Huse of a Thousand Candles" after the Madisons hosted a reception for General [[Andrew Jackson]] and his wife in the building in late 1815.<ref>Gary, p. 34.</ref> [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Martin Van Buren]] lived for a short period in this house as well, just before he was elected. He stayed in it until shortly after his inauguration.<ref>Bryan, p. 251.</ref>

The [[United States Department of State]] occupied one of the Seven Buildings for a few months in 1800,<ref>Tinkler, p. 52.</ref> and the [[United States Constitution]] was housed there for 10 months that same year.<ref>Berges, p. 43.</ref> The British Embassy was also housed in one of them in 1811.<ref>Perkins, p. 279.</ref> [[Elbridge Gerry]] lived there from 1813 to 1814 while he was Vice President,<ref>Bergheim, p. 199.</ref> and [[Stephen Decatur]] purchased 1903 Pennsylvania Avenue in 1817. It was his first home in D.C.<ref>Allison, p. 190-191.</ref>

==Demolition and remaining facades==
During the [[American Civil War]], General [[George B. McClellan]] and General [[Martin Davis Hardin]] both had their headquarters in the Seven Buildings.<ref>Eberlein and Hubbard, p. 329; Brand, p. 99.</ref> Some time after 1865, 1903 Pennsylvania Avenue NW had a fourth story built on top.
<ref>Kelly, p. 75.</ref>

During their first 50 years, the Seven Buildings were some of the most fashionable addresses in the city.  But by the 1890s, they were being used as commercial buildings rather than homes. 1913 Pennsylvania Avenue NW was razed in 1898, and a new four-story structure built there. [[Peoples Drug]] was founded in 1904 at 1901 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, and a Peoples Drug occupied the building until it was demolished.  1901, 1903 and 1905 Pennsylvania Avenue NW were razed in 1959 and a large, modern office building was constructed on the site. By 1979, only 1909 and 1911 Pennsylvania Avenue NW remained.<ref name="Goode" />

In 1986, the last two remaining buildings were butted and their facades incorporated into a $4.5 million, nine-story office building.<ref>McGuire, Kim. "The Oldest on the Avenue." ''Washington Post.'' March 13, 1986.</ref> The office building now houses the [[Embassy of Mexico, Washington, D.C.|Embassy of Mexico]].<ref>Wang, p. 41.</ref>
