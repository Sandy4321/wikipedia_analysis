==Character history==
Astrid appears only in the episode "Voyage of the Damned". She is introduced aboard the starship ''Titanic'' as a waitress from the planet [[List of Doctor Who planets#S|Sto]] with a dream of seeing the stars. Meeting the Tenth Doctor aboard ''Titanic'', she quickly befriends him. She accompanies the Doctor on a trip organised by ''Titanic'''s resident historian, Mr Copper, [[teleporting]] with some ''Titanic'' passengers down to [[List of Doctor Who planets#E|Earth]] where she and the Doctor meet [[Wilfred Mott]]. Upon their return to the ship, she and the Doctor discover the plan of [[List of Doctor Who villains#Max Capricorn|Max Capricorn]] to destroy the ''Titanic'', its passengers and the nearby people of Earth with his villainous angelic robots, [[List of Doctor Who robots#The Host|the Host]]. As they attempt to save the ship, Astrid grows increasingly fond of the Doctor, kissing him as part of what she assures is an "old tradition" on Sto. In the episode's climax, Astrid sacrifices herself to save the Doctor from Capricorn by driving Capricorn off a platform with a [[forklift truck]] and both appear to fall to their peril. Later, realising Astrid was still wearing a teleporter bracelet, the Doctor attempts to recall her atoms in an attempt to resurrect her, but there is insufficient power aboard the damaged ''Titanic'' to do so. Astrid reappears [[spectre|spectral]] and bewildered, as the Doctor kisses her a goodbye before freeing her sentient atoms (described as "stardust") to roam space as energy.<ref name="Episode">{{cite episode | title = [[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Russell T.

==Casting==
The BBC officially announced that Minogue was to feature as Astrid in the episode "Voyage of the Damned" on [[3 July]] [[2007]]. The official announcement followed rumours regarding Minogue's casting having already circulated in the press, although the episode's writer Russell T. Davies had denied these rumours in in-house BBC publication ''[[Ariel (newspaper)|Ariel]]'' in an attempt to keep the news secret for longer. Furthermore, Minogue herself had confirmed that she would be appearing in the episode in ''[[InStyle]]'' magazine, whilst the [[London]] paper ''[[Standard Lite]]'' published a photograph of Minogue's creative director Will Baker carrying a 'to do list' with a note about a Doctor Who script on it, thus indicating that Minogue would be in the episode. Minogue had also been sighted filming for ''Doctor Who'' by members of the public before the official announcement of her casting.<ref name="Gallifreyone">{{cite web
