The '''Barn Swallow''' (''Hirundo rustica'') is the most widespread species of [[swallow]] in the world.<ref name=Turner/> It is a distinctive [[passerine]] bird with blue upperparts, a long, deeply forked [[tail]] and curved, pointed [[Bird flight#Wing|wings]]. It is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas.<ref name="Turner">{{cite book |title=Swallows & martins: an identification guide and handbook |last=Turner |first=Angela K |coauthors= Rose, Chris |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1989 |isbn= 0-395-51174-7 }} p164<U+2013>169</ref> In [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] Europe it is just called the '''Swallow'''; in Northern Europe it is the only common species called a "swallow" rather than a "martin".<ref name="GillAndWright">See Gill, Frank, and Wright, Minturn, ''[[Birds of the World: Recommended English Names]]'' (Princeton 2006), ISBN 978-0-691-12827-6</ref>

There are six subspecies of Barn Swallow, which breed across the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Four are strongly [[bird migration|migratory]], and their wintering grounds cover much of the [[Southern Hemisphere]] as far south as central [[Argentina]], the [[Cape Province]] of South Africa, and northern Australia.<ref name= Turner/> Its huge range means that the Barn Swallow is not endangered, although there may be local population declines due to specific threats.

The Barn Swallow is a bird of open country which normally uses man-made structures to breed and consequently has spread with human expansion. It builds a cup [[bird nest|nest]] from mud pellets in barns or similar structures and feeds on insects caught in flight.<ref name="BWP" /> This species lives in close association with humans, and its insect-eating habits mean that it is tolerated by man; this acceptance was reinforced in the past by superstitions regarding the bird and its nest. There are frequent cultural references to the Barn Swallow in literary and religious works due to both its living in close proximity to humans and its annual migration.<ref name="Cocker" /> The Barn Swallow is the [[list of national birds|national bird]] of [[Austria]] and [[Estonia]].

The adult male Barn Swallow of the nominate subspecies ''H. r. rustica'' is {{convert|17|<U+2013>|19|cm|in|abbr=on}} long including {{convert|2|<U+2013>|7|cm|in|abbr=on}} of elongated outer tail feathers. It has a wingspan of {{convert|32|<U+2013>|34.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} and weighs {{convert|16|<U+2013>|22|g|oz|abbr=on}}. It has steel blue upperparts and a rufous forehead, chin and throat, which are separated from the off-white underparts by a broad dark blue breast band. The outer tail feathers are elongated, giving the distinctive deeply forked "swallow tail." There is a line of white spots across the outer end of the upper tail.<ref name="BWP">{{cite book|last = Snow |first = David |coauthors = Perrins, Christopher M (editors) |title = The Birds of the Western Palearctic concise edition (2 volumes) |publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 1998 |location = Oxford |isbn = 0-19-854099-X}} p1061<U+2013>1064</ref> The female is similar in appearance to the male, but the tail streamers are shorter, the blue of the upperparts and breast band is less glossy, and the underparts paler. The juvenile is browner and has a paler rufous face and whiter underparts. It also lacks the long tail streamers of the adult.<ref name="Turner" />

The song of the Barn Swallow is a cheerful warble, often ending with ''su-seer'' with the second note higher than the first but falling in pitch. Calls include ''witt'' or ''witt-witt'' and a loud ''splee-plink'' when excited (or trying to chase intruders away from the nest).<ref name= BWP/> The [[alarm call]]s include a sharp ''siflitt'' for predators like cats and a ''flitt-flitt'' for [[bird of prey|birds of prey]] like the [[Hobby (bird)|Hobby]].<ref name = Mullarney/> This species is fairly quiet on the wintering grounds.<ref name = Hilty/>

The distinctive combination of a red face and blue breast band render the adult Barn Swallow easy to distinguish from the African ''Hirundo'' species and from the [[Welcome Swallow]] (''Hirundo neoxena'') with which its range overlaps in [[Australasia]].<ref name = Turner/> In Africa the short tail streamers of the juvenile Barn Swallow invite confusion with juvenile [[Red-chested Swallow]] (''Hirundo lucida''), but the latter has a narrower breast band and more white in the tail.<ref name= Barlow/>

== Taxonomy ==
The Barn Swallow was described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' in 1758 as ''Hirundo rustica'', characterised as ''H. rectricibus, exceptis duabus intermediis, macula alba notat<U+00EE>s''.<ref>{{la icon}} {{cite book |last=Linnaeus |first=Carolus |authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus |title=[[Systema Naturae|Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

This genus of blue-backed swallows is sometimes called the "barn swallows."<ref name=Turner/><ref name="GillAndWright"/>

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates the English [[common name]] "barn swallow" to 1851, though an earlier instance of the collocation in an English-language context is in Gilbert White's popular book ''[[The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne|The Natural History of Selborne]]'', originally published in 1789:
<blockquote>
The swallow, though called the chimney-swallow, by no means builds altogether in chimnies {{sic}}, but often within barns and out-houses against the rafters... In ''Sweden'' she builds in barns, and is called ''ladu swala'', the barn-swallow.<ref name= white>{{cite book |last=White |first=Gilbert |authorlink=Gilbert White|title=[[The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]] |year=1789 |location=London |publisher=T. Bensley |pages=167<U+2013>68 |isbn=0-905418-96-4}}</ref>
</blockquote>
This suggests that the English name may be a [[calque]] on the Swedish term.

There are few [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] problems within the genus, but the Red-chested Swallow<U+2014>a resident of West Africa, the [[Congo River|Congo basin]] and [[Ethiopia]]<U+2014>was formerly treated as a subspecies of Barn Swallow. The Red-chested Swallow is slightly smaller than its migratory relative, has a narrower blue breast-band, and the adult has shorter tail streamers. In [[bird flight|flight]], it looks paler underneath than Barn Swallow.<ref name= Barlow>{{cite book |title=A Field Guide to birds of The Gambia and Senegal |last=Barlow |first=Clive |coauthors=Wacher, Tim; Disley, Tony |location=Robertsbridge |publisher=Pica Press |year=1997 |isbn=1-873403-32-1 }} p279</ref>

== Behaviour ==

=== Habitat and range ===
The preferred habitat of the Barn Swallow is open country with low vegetation, such as pasture, meadows and farmland, preferably with nearby water. This swallow avoids heavily wooded or precipitous areas and densely built-up locations. The presence of accessible open structures such as barns, stables, or culverts to provide nesting sites, and exposed locations such as wires, roof ridges or bare branches for perching, are also important in the bird's selection of its breeding range.<ref name="BWP" />

It breeds in the Northern Hemisphere from sea level to typically {{convert|2700|m|ft|abbr=off}},<ref name=BirdLife>{{cite web|title = BirdLife International Species factsheet: ''Hirundo rustica'' |publisher =BirdLife International |accessdate = 6 December 2007 |url =http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=7116&m=1}}</ref> but to {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=off}} in the [[Caucasus]]<ref name=BWP/> and North America,<ref name= umich/> and it is absent only from deserts and the cold northernmost parts of the continents. Over much of its range, it avoids towns, and in Europe is replaced in urban areas by the [[House Martin]]. However, in [[Honsh<U+016B>]], the Barn Swallow is a more urban bird, with the [[Red-rumped Swallow]] (''Cecropis daurica'') replacing it as the rural species.<ref name= Turner/>

In winter, the Barn Swallow is cosmopolitan in its choice of habitat, avoiding only dense forests and deserts.<ref name=SASOL>{{cite book |title=SASOL Birds of Southern Africa |last= Sinclair |first=Ian |coauthors= Hockey, Phil; Tarboton, Warwick |location=Cape Town |publisher=Struik |year=2002 |isbn= 1-86872-721-1 }} p294</ref> It is most common in open, low vegetation habitats, such as [[savanna]] and ranch land, and in [[Venezuela]], South Africa and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] it is described as being particularly attracted to burnt or harvested [[sugarcane]] fields and the waste from the cane.<ref name = Hilty/><ref name = mercy/><ref name = ffrench>{{cite book |last = ffrench<!--this name should not be capitalized--> |first = Richard |title = A Guide to the Birds of Trinidad and Tobago |edition = 2nd |year = 1991 |location=Ithaca, New York |publisher = Comstock Publishing |isbn = 0-8014-9792-2 }} p315<U+2013>6</ref> In the absence of suitable roost sites, they may sometimes roost on wires where they are more exposed to predators.<ref>{{cite journal|author=George,PV |year=1965|title= Swallows ''Hirundo rustica'' Linnaeus roosting on wires|journal=J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc.|volume=62|issue=1|page=160}}</ref> Individual birds tend to return to the same wintering locality each year<ref name= burton/> and congregate from a large area to [[communal roosting|roost]] in reed beds.<ref name=mercy/> These roosts can be extremely large, one in Nigeria had an estimated 1.5 million birds.<ref name=Bijlsma/> These roosts are thought to be a protection from predators, and the arrival of roosting birds is synchronised in order to overwhelm predators like [[African Hobby|African Hobbies]]. The Barn Swallow has been recorded as breeding in the more temperate parts of its winter range, such as the mountains of [[Thailand]] and in central Argentina.<ref name= Turner/><ref name= Lekagul>{{cite book |last = Lekagul |first = Boonsong |coauthors= Round, Philip |title = A Guide to the Birds of Thailand |year = 1991 |location=Bangkok |publisher = Saha Karn Baet |isbn = 9789748567365}} p234</ref>

Migration of Barn Swallows between Britain and South Africa was first established on 23 December 1912 when a bird that had been ringed by James Masefield at a nest in Staffordshire, was found in Natal.<ref name=MigrationAtlas>{{cite book |title=The Migration Atlas: Movements of the Birds of Britain and Ireland |publisher=[[T & AD Poyser]] | year=2002 |isbn= 0-7136-6514-9 |author=Wernham, Chris (editor)|page = 462 }}</ref> As would be expected for a long-distance migrant, this bird has occurred as a vagrant to such distant areas as Hawaii, [[Bermuda]], Greenland, [[Tristan da Cunha]] and the [[Falkland Islands]].<ref name= Turner/>

=== Feeding ===
[[File:Swallow August 2013-2.jpg|thumb|Chicks in the nest waiting for being fed]]
The Barn Swallow is similar in its habits to other aerial [[insectivore]]s, including other swallow species and the unrelated [[swift]]s. It is not a particularly fast flier, with a speed estimated at about 11&nbsp;[[metre per second|m/s]], up to 20&nbsp;[[metre per second|m/s]] and a wing beat rate of approximately 5, up to 7<U+2013>9 times each second,<ref name= flight>{{cite journal|last= Liechti |first= Felix |coauthors= Bruderer, Lukas |date=15 August 2002|url= http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/205/16/2461| publisher = The Company of Biologists |title = Wingbeat frequency of barn swallows and house martins: a comparison between free flight and wind tunnel experiments|journal= The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume= 205|issue= 16|pages= 2461<U+2013>2467|pmid= 12124369}}</ref><ref name= Park>{{cite journal |last=Park |first=Kirsty |coauthors=Ros<U+00E9>n, Mikael; Hedenstr<U+00F6>m, Anders |year= 2001|title=Kinematics of the barn swallow (''Hirundo rustica'') over a wide range of speeds in a wind tunnel |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=204 |issue=15 |pages=2741<U+2013>2750 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/204/15/2741 |accessdate=1 December 2007 |pmid=11533124 |first2=M |first3=A |issn=0022-0949| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071109084723/http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/204/15/2741| archivedate= 9 November 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> but it has the manoeuvrability necessary to feed on flying insects while airborne. It is often seen flying relatively low in open or semi-open areas.

The Barn Swallow typically feeds {{convert|7|<U+2013>|8|m|ft}} above shallow water or the ground, often following animals, humans or farm machinery to catch disturbed insects, but it will occasionally pick prey items from the water surface, walls and plants. In the breeding areas, large [[fly|flies]] make up around 70% of the diet, with [[aphid]]s also a significant component. However, in Europe, the Barn Swallow consumes fewer aphids than the [[House Martin|House]] or [[Sand Martin]]s.<ref name=BWP/> On the wintering grounds, [[Hymenoptera]], especially flying [[ant]]s, are important food items. When egg-laying, Barn Swallows hunt in pairs, but will form often [[Group size measures|large flocks]] otherwise.<ref name=Turner/>

=== Breeding ===
[[File:Cr<U+00ED>asHirundorustica.JPG|thumb|right]]
[[File:Hirundo rustica -West Sussex, England -chick-8.jpg|right|thumb|Juvenile in England]]
The male Barn Swallow returns to the breeding grounds before the females and selects a nest site, which is then advertised to females with a circling flight and song. The breeding success of the male is related to the length of the tail streamers, with longer streamers being more attractive to the female.<ref name=BWP/><ref name = Saino>{{cite journal |last=Saino |first=Nicola|coauthors=Romano, Maria; Sacchi; Roberto; Ninni, Paola; Galeotti, Paolo; M<U+00F8>ller, Anders Pape |month=September |year=2003 |title=Do male barn swallows (''Hirundo rustica'') experience a trade-off between the expression of multiple sexual signals? |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=54 |issue=5 |pages=465<U+2013>471 |doi=10.1007/s00265-003-0642-z}}</ref> Males with longer tail feathers are generally longer-lived and more disease resistant, females thus gaining an indirect fitness benefit from this form of selection, since longer tail feathers indicate a genetically stronger individual which will produce offspring with enhanced vitality.<ref name= Moller/> Males in northern Europe have longer tails than those further south; whereas in Spain the male's tail streamers are only 5% longer than the female's, in Finland the difference is 20%.

Males with long streamers also have larger white tail spots, and since feather-eating [[chewing louse|bird lice]] prefer white feathers, large white tail spots without [[Parasitism|parasite]] damage again demonstrate breeding quality; there is a positive association between spot size and the number of offspring produced each season.<ref name= Kose>{{cite journal |last=Kose |first=Mati |coauthors=M<U+00E4>nd, Raivo: M<U+00F8>ller, Anders Pape |month=December |year=1999 |title=Sexual selection for white tail spots in the barn swallow in relation to habitat choice by feather lice |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=1201<U+2013>1205 |doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1249 |pmid=10600140  |issn=0003-3472}}</ref>

As its name implies, the Barn Swallow typically nests inside accessible buildings such as barns and stables, or under bridges and wharves. The neat cup-shaped nest is placed on a beam or against a suitable vertical projection. It is constructed by both sexes, although more often by the female, with mud pellets collected in their beaks and lined with grasses, feathers, algae<ref>{{cite journal|last=Duffin|first=K.|year=1973|title=Barn Swallows use freshwater and marine algae in nest construction|journal=Wilson Bull.|volume=85|pages=237<U+2013>238}}</ref> or other soft materials.<ref name=Turner/> Barn Swallows may nest colonially where sufficient high-quality nest sites are available, and within a colony, each pair defends a territory around the nest which, for the European subspecies, is four to eight square metres (45 to 90 square feet) in size. [[Group size measures|Colony size]] tends to be larger in North America.<ref name= umich/>

In North America at least, Barn Swallows frequently engage in a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualist]] relationship with [[Osprey]]s. Barn Swallows will build their nest below an Osprey nest, receiving protection from other birds of prey which are repelled by the exclusively fish-eating Ospreys. The Ospreys are alerted to the presence of these predators by the alarm calls of the swallows.<ref name= umich/>

Before man-made sites became common, the Barn Swallow nested on cliff faces or in caves, but this is now rare. The female lays two to seven, but typically four or five, reddish-spotted white eggs. The eggs are 20&nbsp;x&nbsp;14&nbsp;millimetres (0.6&nbsp;x&nbsp;0.8 in) in size, and weigh 1.9&nbsp;grammes (0.07&nbsp;oz), of which 5 percent is shell. In Europe, the female does almost all the [[avian incubation|incubation]], but in North America the male may incubate up to 25% of the time. The incubation period is normally 14<U+2013>19 days, with another 18<U+2013>23 days before the [[altricial]] chicks fledge. The fledged young stay with, and are fed by, the parents for about a week after leaving the nest. Occasionally, first-year birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood.<ref name=Turner/>

The Barn Swallow will [[mobbing behavior|mob]] intruders such as cats or [[accipiter]]s that venture too close to their nest, often flying very close to the threat.<ref name = Moller>
{{cite book |last=M<U+00F8>ller |first=Anders Pape |year=1994 |title=Sexual Selection and the Barn Swallow |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-854028-0| page=245}}</ref> Adult Barn Swallows have few predators, but some are taken by accipiters, [[falcon]]s, and [[owl]]s. [[Brood parasite|Brood parasitism]] by [[cowbird]]s in North America or [[cuckoo]]s in Eurasia is rare.<ref name=BWP/><ref name= umich/>

There are normally two broods, with the original nest being reused for the second brood and being repaired and reused in subsequent years. Hatching success is 90% and the fledging survival rate is 70<U+2013>90%. Average mortality is 70<U+2013>80% in the first year and 40<U+2013>70% for the adult. Although the record age is more than 11 years, most survive less than four years.<ref name=Turner/> Barn Swallow nestlings have prominent red gapes, a feature shown to induce feeding by parent birds. An experiment in manipulating brood size and immune system showed the vividness of the gape was positively correlated with T-cell<U+2013>mediated immunocompetence, and that larger brood size and injection with an antigen led to a less vivid gape.<ref name="Saino03">{{cite journal|last=Saino, Nicola; Ambrosini, Roberto; Martinelli, Roberta; Ninni, Paola;; M<U+00F8>ller, Anders Pape|year=2003|title=Gape coloration reliably reflects immunocompetence of barn swallow (''Hirundo rustica'') nestlings|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=14|issue=1|pages=16<U+2013>22|url=http://www.georgealozano.com/papers/Saino2K03.pdf|accessdate=27 June 2010|doi=10.1093/beheco/14.1.16|first1=N.}}</ref>

The Barn Swallow has been recorded as [[hybrid (biology)|hybridising]] with the [[Cliff Swallow]] (''Petrochelidon pyrrhonota'') and the [[Cave Swallow]] (''P. fulva'') in North America, and the House Martin (''Delichon urbicum'') in Eurasia, the cross with the latter being one of the most common passerine hybrids.<ref name = Moller/>

== Parasites and predators ==
[[File:Feather hole.jpg|thumb|right| A feeding trace of ''Brueelia'' lice on the tail feather of a Barn Swallow]]
Barn Swallows (and other small [[passerines]]) often have characteristic [[feather holes]] on their wing and tail feathers. These holes were suggested as being caused by [[Phthiraptera|avian lice]] such as ''[[Machaerilaemus malleus]]'' and ''[[Myrsidea rustica]]'', although other studies suggest that they are mainly caused by species of ''[[Brueelia]]''. Several other species of lice have been described from Barn Swallow hosts, including ''Brueelia domestica'' and ''Philopterus microsomaticus''.<ref>{{cite book|author=M<U+00F8>ller, A P|year=1991 |chapter= Parasites, sexual ornaments and mate choice in the Barn Swallow ''Hirundo rustica''|title=Bird-parasite interactions: Ecology, evolution, and behaviour|editor= Loye, J E and Zuk, M |publisher=Oxford University Press|location = Oxford| pages=328<U+2013>343}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|year=2008|url=http://www.zoologia.hu/list/Vas_et_al.pdf |format=pdf|title=The feather holes on the barn swallow ''Hirundo rustica'' and other small passerines are probably caused by ''Brueelia'' spp. lice|journal=Journal of Parasitology|volume=94|issue=6|pages=1438<U+2013>1440|doi=10.1645/GE-1542.1|pmid=18576840|month= |last1=Vas|first1=Z|last2=Cs<U+00F6>rgo|first2=T|last3=M<U+00F8>ller|first3=A P|last4=R<U+00F3>zsa|first4=L|issn=0022-3395}}</ref> In Texas, the swallow bug (''[[Oeciacus vicarius]]'') which is common on species such as the [[Cliff Swallow]] is also known to infest Barn Swallows.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=J.

== Status ==
The Barn Swallow has an enormous range, with an estimated global extent of 51.7&nbsp;million&nbsp;square kilometres (19.96&nbsp;million square miles) and a population of 190 million individuals. The species is evaluated as "least concern" on the 2007 IUCN Red List,<ref name=IUCN2012/> and has no special status under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ([[CITES]]), which regulates international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants.<ref name= umich>{{cite web |last=Dewey |first=Tanya |coauthors=Roth, Chava |title=''Hirundo rustica'' |url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Hirundo_rustica.html |year=2002 |work=Animal Diversity Web |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology |accessdate=19 November 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071210232505/http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Hirundo_rustica.html| archivedate= 10 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

This is a species which has greatly benefited historically from forest clearance, which has created the open habitats it prefers, and from human habitation, which have given it an abundance of safe man-made nest sites. There have been local declines due to the use of [[DDT]] in Israel in the 1950s, competition for nest sites with [[House Sparrow]]s in the US in the 19th century, and an ongoing gradual decline in numbers in parts of Europe and Asia due to agricultural intensification, reducing the availability of insect food. However, there has been an increase in the population in North America during the 20th century with the greater availability of nesting sites and subsequent range expansion, including the colonisation of northern [[Alberta]].<ref name=Turner/>

A specific threat to wintering birds from the European populations is the transformation by the South African government of a light aircraft runway near [[Durban]] into [[King Shaka International Airport|an international airport]] for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]. The roughly {{convert|250|m|yd|abbr=off}} square Mount Moreland reed bed is a night roost for more than three million Barn Swallows, which represent one percent of the global population and eight percent of the European breeding population. The reed bed lies on the flight path of aircraft using the proposed La Mercy airport, and there were fears that it would be cleared because the birds could threaten aircraft safety.<ref name= Guardian>{{cite news|title=World Cup airport 'threatens swallow population' |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2006/nov/16/travelnews.conservationandendangeredspecies.environment |date=16 November 2006 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=27 November 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071203201940/http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2006/nov/16/travelnews.conservationandendangeredspecies.environment| archivedate= 3 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name = BirdLife2>{{cite press release

[[Climate change]] may affect the Barn Swallow; drought causes weight loss and slow feather regrowth, and the expansion of the Sahara will make it a more formidable obstacle for migrating European birds. Hot dry summers will reduce the availability of insect food for chicks. Conversely, warmer springs may lengthen the breeding season and result in more chicks, and the opportunity to use nest sites outside buildings in the north of the range might also lead to more offspring.<ref name= BB102>{{cite journal| last=Turner | first=Angela | month= January| year= 2009 | title= Climate change: a Swallow's eye view| journal= British Birds| volume=102 | issue=1 | pages= 3<U+2013>16 }}</ref>

== Relationship with humans ==
[[File:Hirundo rustica young male spring NRM.jpg|thumb|upright|A male]]
The Barn Swallow is an attractive bird which feeds on flying insects and has therefore been tolerated by humans when it shares their buildings for nesting. As one of the earlier migrants, this conspicuous species is also seen as an early sign of summer's approach.<ref name=Welldon/>

In the [[Old World]], the Barn Swallow appears to have used man-made structures and bridges since time immemorial. An early reference is in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Georgics]]'' (29 BC) ''...garrula quam tignis nidum suspendat hirundo'' (...the twittering swallow hangs its nest from the rafters).<ref name=Virgil>{{la icon}} Virgil, ''The Georgics'' [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/virgil/geo/geol04.htm Text Book IV line 307]. Retrieved 28 November 2007</ref>

It is believed that the Barn Swallow began attaching its nest to Native American habitations in the early 19th century, and the subsequent spread of settlement across North America is thought to have resulted in a dramatic population expansion of the species across the continent.<ref name = Williams/>

Many cattle farmers believed that swallows spread ''[[Salmonella]]'' infections, however a study in Sweden showed no evidence of the birds being reservoirs of the bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Haemig|first=Paul D. |coauthors=Hernandez J., Waldenstr<U+00F6>m J., Bonnedahl J. & Olsen B|journal=Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases |title=Barn swallows (''Hirundo rustica'') test negative for ''Salmonella'' | year=2008 |volume=8 |issue=4 | pages=451<U+2013>454| doi=10.1089/vbz.2007.0233| pmid=18266565| issn=1530-3667}}</ref>

=== In literature ===
Many literary references are based on the Barn Swallow's northward migration as a symbol of spring or summer. The [[proverb]] about the necessity for more than one piece of evidence goes back at least to [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'': "For as one swallow or one day does not make a spring, so one day or a short time does not make a fortunate or happy man."<ref name=Welldon>{{cite book |last=Welldon |first=James Edward Cowell (translator) |year=1987 |origyear=1897 |title=The Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle |chapter=Book 1, chapter 6 |publisher=Prometheus |location=Buffalo |isbn=0-87975-378-1}}</ref>

The Barn Swallow symbolizes the coming of spring and thus love in the ''[[Pervigilium Veneris]]'', a late [[Latin]] poem. In "[[The Waste Land]]", [[T. S. Eliot]] quoted the line ''"Quando fiam uti chelidon [ut tacere desinam]?"'' ("When will I be like the swallow, so that I can stop being silent?") This refers to a version of the myth of [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomela]] in which she turns into a [[Nightingale]] and her sister Procne into a [[Swallow]]; in less familiar versions, the two species are reversed.<ref>{{cite book |last = Nims |first = John Frederick |authorlink = John Frederick Nims |year = 1981 |title = The Harper Anthology of Poetry |publisher = Harper and Row |location=New York |isbn = 0-06-044846-6}}</ref> On the other hand, an image of the assembly of Swallows for their southward migration concludes [[John Keats]]'s ode "[[To Autumn]]".

There are mentions of the Barn Swallow in the Bible, although it seems likely that it is confused with the [[swift]]s in many translations,<ref name = bible>{{cite news |title=Swallow |url=http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/S/SWALLOW/ |work=International Standard Bible Encyclopedia |publisher=Bible History Online |accessdate=18 November 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071117224841/http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/S/SWALLOW/| archivedate= 17 November 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> or possibly other [[swallow|hirundine species]] which breed in [[Israel]].<ref name= Mullarney/> However, "Yea, the sparrow hath found her a house, And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young" from {{bibleverse||Psalms|84:3|!}} likely applies to the Barn Swallow.<ref name = bible/>

The swallow is also notably cited in several of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays for the swiftness of its flight; for example: "True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings ..." from Act 5 of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', and "I have horse will follow where the game Makes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain." from the second act of ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''. Shakespeare also references the annual migration of the species poetically in ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', Act 4: "Daffodils, That come before the swallow dares, and take The winds of March with beauty; violets dim, ...".

=== In culture ===


[[Gilbert White]] studied the Barn Swallow in detail in his pioneering work ''The Natural History of Selborne'', but even this careful observer was uncertain whether it migrated or hibernated in winter.<ref name= white>{{cite book |last=White |first=Gilbert |title=The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne |year=1887 |origyear=1789 |location=London |publisher=Cassell & Company |oclc=3423785 |pages=38<U+2013>39 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20933/20933-h/20933-h.htm |isbn=0-905418-96-4}}</ref> Elsewhere, its long journeys have been well observed, and a [[swallow tattoo]] is popular amongst nautical men as a symbol of a safe return; the tradition was that a mariner had a tattoo of this fellow wanderer after sailing 5,000 nautical miles (9,260&nbsp;km, 5,755 statute miles). A second swallow would be added after 10,000&nbsp;nautical miles (18,520&nbsp;km, 11,510&nbsp;statute miles) at sea.<ref name =mmbc>{{cite web |title=Hardtack and marlinspikes&nbsp;<U+2013> life and work aboard ship |work= Sailors' tattoos post-visit activity, teachers' handout |url=http://mmbc.bc.ca/downloads/educational_materials/Tatoos/tattoo%20activity%20text.pdf |format=pdf |publisher=Maritime Museum of British Columbia |accessdate=2007-12-01}}</ref>
In the past, the tolerance for this beneficial [[insectivore]] was reinforced by superstitions regarding damage to the Barn Swallow's nest. Such an act might lead to cows giving bloody milk, or no milk at all, or to hens ceasing to lay.<ref name= Cocker >{{cite book |last=Cocker |first=Mark |coauthors=Mabey, Richard |title=Birds Britannica |year=2005 |location=London |publisher=Chatto & Windus |isbn=0-7011-6907-9}}</ref> This may be a factor in the longevity of swallows' nests. Survival, with suitable annual refurbishment, for 10<U+2013>15 years is regular, and one nest was reported to have been occupied for 48 years.<ref name= Cocker/>

It is depicted as the ''Martlet'', ''Merlette'' or ''Merlot'' in [[heraldry]], where it represents younger sons who have no lands. It is also represented as lacking feet as this was a common belief at the time.<ref name = "Cooper92">{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=JC |title=Symbolic and Mythological Animals |pages=218<U+2013>19 |year=1992 |publisher=Aquarian Press |location=London |isbn=1-85538-118-4}}</ref> As a result of a campaign by [[ornithology|ornithologists]], the Barn Swallow has been the national bird of [[Estonia]] since 23 June 1960.<ref name="Estonia">{{cite web |title=The State&nbsp;<U+2014> Structure and Symbols |work=Estonia |url=http://www.estonia.gov.uk/estonia/state |publisher=Estonian Embassy in London |accessdate=27 November 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071115000710/http://www.estonia.gov.uk/estonia/state| archivedate= 15 November 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name = Estonia2>{{cite web |title=National symbols of Estonia |url=http://www.einst.ee/publications/symbols/ |publisher=The Estonia Institute |accessdate=27 November 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071109221700/http://www.einst.ee/publications/symbols/| archivedate= 9 November 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref>
