[[File:SFMM- Full Throttle 3.JPG|thumb|Full Throttle's dive into the tunnel.]]
==Ride experience==
The [[train (roller coaster)|train]] is launched from 0 to {{convert|70|mph}} out of the [[station (roller coaster)|station]] into the record-breaking {{convert|160|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} [[vertical loop]]. Riders then enter into a high-banked curve to the right and then another to the left as they approach the second inversion, a [[dive loop]].<ref name="Magic Mountain Announces Next Mega-Coaster"/> This inversion drops down into a tunnel previously used for the park's [[monorail]] system, where the train comes to a halt.<ref name="Six Flags Magic Mountain Launches World Record Coaster for 2013">{{cite news|last=Peralta|first=Mark|title=Six Flags Magic Mountain Launches World Record Coaster for 2013|url=<!--Link blocked by Wikipedia spam filter-->|accessdate=August 31, 2012|newspaper=Examiner|date=August 30, 2012}}</ref> The train is then launched backwards out of the tunnel and partially up the dive loop. Once it loses its backward momentum, the train returns forward into the tunnel and is launched out of the tunnel and straight into a high-G turn to the left.<ref name="Six Flags Magic Mountain Cranks It Up: Full Throttle In 2013">{{cite news|title=Six Flags Magic Mountain Cranks It Up: Full Throttle In 2013|url=http://hometownstation.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=30980:six-flags-magic-clarita-2012-08-30-09-38&catid=26:local-news&Itemid=97|accessdate=August 31, 2012|newspaper=KHTS Radio|date=August 30, 2012}}</ref> Riders then go up the [[Top hat (roller coaster element)|top hat]] that is located on top of the loop.<ref name="Six Flags Magic Mountain to open world<U+2019>s tallest looping coaster in 2013">{{cite news|title=Six Flags Magic Mountain to open world<U+2019>s tallest looping coaster in 2013|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/losangeles/news/2012/08/30/magic-mountain-to-open-tallest-coaster.html|accessdate=August 31, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Business|date=August 30, 2012}}</ref> Riders drop from the hill and reach the [[brake run]] before entering a 180-degree turn to the left back into the station.<ref name="Magic Mountain Announces Next Mega-Coaster">{{cite news|title=Magic Mountain Announces Next Mega-Coaster|url=http://scvnews.com/?p=35098|accessdate=August 31, 2012|newspaper=SCVNews|date=August 30, 2012}}</ref>

==Height Requirements==
In order for guests to ride Full Throttle, riders must be at least 54 inches. While some Premier Ride's coasters normally have their height restriction at 48 inches, Full Throttle's is 54 inches due to the one inversion at 160 feet. Each seat includes an individual lap bar for the guest. There are no seat beats for guests as it would slow down dispatch operations and it would take longer to dispatch each train. Due to the aggressiveness and high speeds of this ride, it is labeled by Six Flags Magic Mountain as a maximum rating ride and is not a family friendly ride.

==Records==
Full Throttle features the world's tallest vertical loop on a roller coaster at {{Convert|160|ft}} high, surpassing [[Superman: Krypton Coaster]] at [[Six Flags Fiesta Texas]]' {{Convert|145|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} vertical loop.<ref name="Six Flags Magic Mountain spills plans for record-setting coaster"/>

It has the first top hat attached directly onto the back of the vertical loop.  As of 2013 no other looping roller-coaster has this type of top hat.
