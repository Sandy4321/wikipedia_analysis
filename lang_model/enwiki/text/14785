The rebellion originated in [[Kronstadt]], a naval fortress on [[Kotlin Island]] in the [[Gulf of Finland]] that served as the base of the Russian [[Baltic Fleet]] and as a guardpost for the approaches to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], 55 kilometres away.

==Economic background==
By 1921 the Bolsheviks were winning the Russian Civil War<ref name="Morcombe, Smith 2010. p. 165">Morcombe, Smith. ''The Spirit Of Change: Russia in Revolution'', 2010. p. 165.</ref> and although foreign troops were beginning to withdraw, Bolshevik leaders continued to keep tight control of the economy through the policy of [[War Communism]]. As a result{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}, the [[Bolshevik Russia|bolshevik economy]] started to collapse, although it had never truly recovered from the economic crises caused by World War I and the Russian Civil War.<ref name="Morcombe, Smith 2010. p. 165"/> Industrial output fell dramatically; it is estimated that the total output of mines and factories fell in 1921 to 20% of the pre-World War I level, with many crucial items experiencing an even more drastic decline. Production of cotton, for example, fell to 5%, and iron to 2%, of the prewar level. This coincided with the extreme droughts of 1920 and 1921 and the severe [[Russian famine of 1921|famine in 1921]]. This brought about large-scale discontent among the Russian populace, particularly amongst the peasantry, who felt disadvantaged by Communist grain requisitioning (''[[prodrazvyorstka]]'', forced seizure of large portions of the peasants grain crop used to feed urban dwellers) and as a result often refused to till their land. In February 1921 alone, there were over one hundred peasant uprisings. The workers in [[Petrograd]] were also involved in a series of strikes sparked by the reduction of bread rations by one third over a 10 day period.<ref>[http://www.johndclare.net/Russ8_Kronstadt.htm "The Kronstadt Mutiny notes on Orlando Figes, A People's Tragedy (1996)"],</ref>

==Petropavlovsk resolution==
On February 26, delegates from the Kronstadt sailors visited Petrograd to investigate the situation.  On February 28, in response to the delegates' report of heavy-handed Bolshevik repression of strikes in Petrograd (claims which might have been inaccurate or exaggerated<ref>Kronstadt, 1921, Paul Avrich ISBN 0-691-08721-0, Princeton University Press</ref>), the crews of the battleships ''[[Russian battleship Petropavlovsk (1914)|Petropavlovsk]]'' and ''[[Russian battleship Sevastopol (1911)|Sevastopol]]'' held an emergency meeting, which approved a resolution raising fifteen demands:<ref>http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/russia/mett/petro_eve.html</ref>

On March 1, a general meeting of the garrison was held, attended also by [[Mikhail Kalinin]] and Commissar of the [[Soviet Baltic Fleet]] [[Nikolai Kuzmin]], who made speeches for the Government. The general meeting passed a resolution including the fifteen demands given above. On March 2 a conference of sailor, soldier and worker organization delegates, after hearing speeches by Kuzmin and Vasiliev, President of the Kronstadt Executive Committee, arrested these two, and amid incorrect rumors of immediate attack approved formation of a Provisional Revolutionary Committee.<ref>http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mhuey/TOC/IZV.frame.html</ref> The Government responded with an ultimatum the same day. This alleged that the revolt had "undoubtedly been prepared by French counterintelligence" and that the ''Petropavlovsk'' resolution was an "SR-Black Hundred" resolution. SR stood for [[Social Revolutionaries]], a democratic socialist party that had been dominant in the soviets before the return of [[Vladimir Lenin]], and whose right wing had refused to support the Bolsheviks. The [[Black Hundreds]] were a reactionary [[Nationalism#Ultranationalism|ultranationalist]] movement in Russia in the early 20th century, that were supporters of the [[House of Romanov]] and opposed any retreat from the [[autocracy]] of the reigning monarch.

==Suppression of the revolt==
[[Image:Map of St. Petersburg (Einseitige Farbkarte).jpeg|thumb|right|300px|1888 German map showing [[Kronstadt]] Bay and later [[Petrograd]].]]
The Bolshevik government began its attack on Kronstadt on March 7.<ref name="Figes, 763">Figes, 763.</ref> Some 60,000 troops under command of [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] took part in the attack.<ref name="Figes, 767">Figes, 767.</ref> The workers of Petrograd  were under [[martial law]] and could offer little support to Kronstadt.<ref>Orlando Figes, ''A People's Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891-1924'' (New York: Viking Press 1997), 760.</ref>
There was a hurry to gain control of the fortress before the melting of the bay as it would have made it impregnable for the land army.<ref name="Figes, 763"/>  On March 17, the [[Bolshevik]] forces finally entered the city of Kronstadt after having suffered over 10,000 fatalities.<ref name="Figes, 767"/> On March 19, the Bolshevik forces took full control of the city of Kronstadt after having suffered fatalities ranging from 527 to 1,412 (or higher if the toll from the first assault is included.) The day after the surrender of Kronstadt, the Bolsheviks celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Paris Commune]].

Although there are no reliable figures for the rebels' battle losses, historians estimate that 1,200 to 2,168 were executed in the days following the revolt, and a like number were jailed, many in the [[Solovki prison camp]].<ref name="Figes, 767"/> Official Soviet figures claim approximately 1,000 rebels were killed, 2,000 wounded, and between 2,300 to 6,528 captured, with 6,000 to 8,000 defecting to Finland, while the Red Army lost 527 killed and 3285 wounded.<ref>Pukhov, A. S. ''Kronshtadtskii miatezh v 1921 g.'' Leningrad, OGIZ-Molodaia Gvardiia.</ref> Later on, 1,050 to 1,272 prisoners were freed and 750 to 1,486 sentenced to five years' forced labour.
More fortunate rebels managed to escape to [[Finland]], their large number causing the first major refugee problem for the newly-independent state.<ref name="pilotkustannus.fi">[http://www.pilotkustannus.fi/etu.php?action=hae&haku=wessman&id=952-464-213-1&sivu=kirjat&ryhma=historia Kronstadtin kapina 1921 ja sen perilliset Suomessa (Kronstadt Rebellion 1921 and Its Descendants in Finland)] by Erkki Wessmann.</ref> The refugees in Finland were later pardoned through an amnesty. Among them was Petrichenko himself, who lived in Finland and worked as a spy for the Soviet [[Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie|GPU]].<ref name="pilotkustannus.fi"/> He was arrested by the Finnish authorities in 1941 and was expelled to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1944. Some months after his return, he was arrested on espionage charges and sentenced to ten years in prison. He died in [[Vladimir prison]] in 1947.<ref>"Kapinallisen salaisuus" ("The Secret of a Rebel"), Suomen Kuvalehti (a Finnish magazine, http://www.suomenkuvalehti.fi/), page 39, issue SK24 / 2007, 15.6.2007</ref>

Although Red Army units suppressed the uprising, the general dissatisfaction with the state of affairs could not have been more forcefully expressed. Vladimir Lenin stated that Kronstadt "lit up reality like a lightning flash". Against this background of discontent, Lenin concluded that [[world revolution]] was not imminent and proceeded in the spring of 1921 to replace the [[War communism|War Communism]] with his New Economic Policy.

== Charges of international and counter-revolutionary involvement in the rebellion ==
{{Anarchism sidebar |History}}

Claims that the Kronstadt uprising was instigated by foreign and counter-revolutionary forces extended beyond the March 2 government ultimatum. The [[anarchist]] [[Emma Goldman]], who was in Petrograd at the time of the rebellion, described in a retrospective account from 1938 how "the news in the Paris Press about the Kronstadt uprising two weeks before it happened had been stressed in the [official press] campaign against the sailors as proof positive that they had been tools of the Imperialist gang and that rebellion had actually been hatched in Paris. It was too obvious that this yarn was used only to discredit the Kronstadters in the eyes of the workers."<ref name="goldman">"[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Goldman/Writings/Essays/trotsky.html Trotsky Protests Too Much]" by Emma Goldman</ref> In 1970 the historian Paul Avrich published a comprehensive history of the rebellion including analysis of "evidence of the involvement of anti-Bolshevik <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9> groups."<ref name="Smele2006">{{cite book|author=Jonathan Smele|title=The Russian Revolution and Civil War 1917-1921: An Annotated Bibliograpy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XN1k1M2I060C&pg=PA628&lpg=PA628&dq=Jonathan+Smele+bibliography&source=bl&ots=lC1CmdadbI&sig=r0pWc4L-pqD1x4PGbym_jCwMgJA&hl=en#v=onepage&q=Avrich%20336&f=false 2006|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-1-59114-348-2|page=336}}</ref> An appendix to Avrich's history included a document titled ''Memorandum on the Question of Organizing an Uprising in Kronstadt'', the original of which was located in "the Russian Archive of Columbia University" (today called the Bakhmeteff Archive of Russian & East European Culture). Avrich says this memorandum was probably written between January and early February 1921 by an agent of an exile opposition group called the National Centre in [[Finland]].<ref name="Avrich1970">{{cite book|author=Paul Avrich|title=Kronstadt 1921|url=|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-08721-0}}</ref> The "Memorandum" has become a touchstone in debates about the rebellion.

Those debates started at the time of the rebellion. Because Leon Trotsky was in charge of the Red Army forces that suppressed the uprising, with the backing of Lenin, the question of whether the suppression was justified became a point of contention on the revolutionary left, in debates between anarchists and Leninist Marxists about the character of the Soviet state and Leninist politics, and more particularly in debates between anarchists and Trotsky and his followers. It remains so to this day.  On the pro-Leninist side of those debates, the memorandum published by Avrich is treated as a "smoking gun" showing foreign and counter-revolutionary conspiracy behind the rebellion, for example in an article from 1990 by a Trotskyist writer, [[Abbie Bakan]]. Bakan says "[t]he document includes remarkably detailed information about the resources, personnel, arms and plans of the Kronstadt rebellion. It also details plans regarding White army and French government support for the Kronstadt sailors' March rebellion."<ref>Abbie Bakan, "Kronstadt: A Tragic Necessity" *Socialist Worker Review* 136, November 1990; reproduced at http://www.marxisme.dk/arkiv/bakan/90-krons.htm</ref>

Bakan says the National Centre originated in 1918 as a self-described "underground organization formed in Russia for the struggle against the Bolsheviks." After being infiltrated by the Bolshevik Cheka secret police, the group suffered the arrest and execution of many of its central members, and was forced to reconstitute itself in exile.<ref name="Service2012">{{cite book|author=Robert Service|title=Spies and Commissars: The Early Years of the Russian Revolution|url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1610391403/ref=sib_dp_kd#reader-link|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=1610391403 (ebook reprint ed. 2012)|page=51}}</ref> Bakan links the National Centre to the White army [[General Wrangel]], who had evacuated an army of seventy or eighty thousand troops to Turkey in late 1920.<ref>Bakan, op. cit.</ref> However, Avrich says that the "Memorandum" probably was composed by a National Centre agent in Finland. Avrich reaches a different conclusion as to the meaning of the "Memorandum":

:[R]eading the document quickly shows that Kronstadt was not a product of a White conspiracy but rather that the White "National Centre" aimed to try and use a spontaneous "uprising" it thought was likely to "erupt there in the coming spring" for its own ends. The report notes that "among the sailors, numerous and unmistakable signs of mass dissatisfaction with the existing order can be noticed." Indeed, the "Memorandum" states that "one must not forget that even if the French Command and the Russian anti-Bolshevik organisations do not take part in the preparation and direction of the uprising, a revolt in Kronstadt will take place all the same during the coming spring, but after a brief period of success it will be doomed to failure."<ref>quoted by Avrich, op. cit., pp. 235, 240, cited in [http://www.infoshop.org/faq/append42.html What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?]</ref>

Avrich rejects the idea that the "Memorandum" explains the revolt:

:Nothing has come to light to show that the Secret Memorandum was ever put into practice or that any links had existed between the emigres and the sailors before the revolt. On the contrary, the rising bore the earmarks of spontaneity... there was little in the behaviour of the rebels to suggest any careful advance preparation. Had there been a prearranged plan, surely the sailors would have waited a few weeks longer for the ice to melt... The rebels, moreover, allowed [[Mikhail Kalinin|Kalinin]] (a leading Communist) to return to Petrograd, though he would have made a valuable hostage. Further, no attempt was made to take the offensive... Significant too, is the large number of Communists who took part in the movement.(...)

:The Sailors needed no outside encouragement to raise the banner of insurrection... Kronstadt was clearly ripe for a rebellion. What set it off was not the machination of emigre conspirators and foreign intelligence agents but the wave of peasant risings throughout the country and the labour disturbances in neighboring Petrograd. And as the revolt unfolded, it followed the pattern of earlier outbursts against the central government from 1905 through the Civil War." <ref>Avrich, op. cit., pp. 111<U+2013>12, cited in [http://www.infoshop.org/faq/append42.html What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?]</ref>

:Moreover, whether the Memorandum played a part in the revolt can be seen from the reactions of the White "National Centre" to the uprising. Firstly, they failed to deliver aid to the rebels or to get French aid to them. Secondly, Professor Grimm, the chief agent of the National Centre in Helsingfors and General Wrangel's official representative in Finland, stated to a colleague after the revolt had been crushed that if a new outbreak should occur then their group must not be caught unawares again. Avrich also notes that the revolt "caught the emigres off balance" and that "nothing... had been done to implement the Secret Memorandum, and the warnings of the author were fully borne out." <ref>Avrich, op. sit., pp. 212, 123, cited in [http://www.infoshop.org/faq/append42.html What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?]</ref>

(A 2003 bibliography by a historian of the Russian Civil War characterizes Avrich's history as "the only full-length, scholarly, non-partisan account of the genesis, course and repression of the rebellion to have appeared in English.")<ref>Smele, op. cit., p. 336</ref>

==Composition of the garrison==
{{Debate|date=January 2011}}
{{Unreliable sources|date=October 2009}}
A contentious debate is over the composition of the garrison of sailors at kronstadt. Some proclaim they were a different group, others proclaim they were the same revolutionary sailors of 1917. [[Emma Goldman]] criticized [[Leon Trotsky]] for his role in the suppression of the rebellion, arguing that it made his later criticism of Stalinism hypocritical.<ref name="goldman" /> Trotsky responded that Goldman's criticisms were mainly perfunctory, and that they ignored the differing social composition between the [[October Revolution#Background|pro-Bolshevik Kronstadt Uprising of 1917]] and the mainly "petty bourgeois" Kronstadt Uprising of 1921.<ref>"[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/01/kronstadt.htm Hue and Cry Over Kronstadt] by Leon Trotsky.</ref>
[[File:<U+041A><U+0440><U+043E><U+043D><U+0448><U+0442><U+0430><U+0434><U+0442>. <U+0412><U+0435><U+0447><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439> <U+043E><U+0433><U+043E><U+043D><U+044C>.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial to the victims of the 1921 Kronstadt Uprising.]]

Defenders of the Bolshevik policy, such as [[Abbie Bakan]], have claimed that the Kronstadt rebels were not the same sailors as those who had been revolutionary heroes in 1917.<ref name="bakan">[http://www.marxisme.dk/arkiv/bakan/90-krons.htm "Kronstadt - A Tragic Necessity"] <U+2013> by Abbie Bakan</ref> In response, [[Israel Getzler]] presents detailed evidence that the vast majority of the sailors had been in the Navy since 1917:<ref>Getzler (2002), pp. 207<U+2013>208. Mawdsley and Saul present similar evidence.</ref>

:(...)that the veteran politicized Red sailor still predominated at Kronstadt at the end of 1920 is borne out by the hard statistical data available regarding the crews of the two major battleships, the [[Russian battleship Petropavlovsk (1911)|Petropavlovsk]] and the [[Russian battleship Sevastopol (1911)|Sevastopol]], both renowned since 1917 for their revolutionary zeal and Bolshevik allegiance. Of 2,028 sailors whose years of enlistment are known, no less than 1,904 or 93.9% were recruited into the navy before and during the 1917 revolution, the largest group, 1,195, having joined in the years 1914-16. Only some 137 sailors or 6.8% were recruited in the years 1918-21, including three who were conscripted in 1921, and they were the only ones who had not been there during the 1917 revolution. As for the sailors of the Baltic Fleet in general (and that included the ''Petropavlovsk'' and ''Sevastopol''), of those serving on 1 January 1921 at least 75.5% are likely to have been drafted into the fleet before 1918. Over 80% were drawn from [[Great Russia]]n areas (mainly central Russia and the [[Volga]] area), some 10% from the [[Ukraine]], and 9% from [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Poland]].<br>...

:Nor, as has so often been claimed, did new recruits, some 400 of whom [[Yasinsky]] had interviewed, arrive in numbers large enough to dilute or even 'demoralize' Kronstadt's Red sailors. As [[Evan Mawdsley]] has found, 'only 1,313 of a planned total of 10,384 recruits had arrived' by 1 December 1920, and even they seem to have been stationed in the barracks of the Second Baltic Crew in Petrograd.

[[Tony Cliff]] defends the Bolshevik policy, stating that "the number of industrial workers in Russia, always a minority, fell from 3 million in 1917 to 1,240,000, a decline of 58.7%, in 1921<U+2013>22. So was there a decline in the agricultural proletariat, from 2,100,000 in 1917, to 34,000 only two years later (a decline of 98.5%). But the number of peasant households (not individuals which is many times greater) had risen with the parcelization of land from 16.5 million in early 1918 to over 25 million households by 1920, an increase of some 50%."<ref>Cliff, vol. 3, p. 143.</ref>

According to this view, the majority of the sailors in the Baltic Fleet stationed at Kronstadt were recent recruits of peasant origin. [[Stepan Petrichenko]] was himself a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] peasant.<ref>Lincoln, p. 498.</ref> He later acknowledged that many of his fellow mutineers were peasants from the south, who were in sympathy with the peasant opposition movement against the Bolsheviks. In the words of Petrichenko: "When we returned home our parents asked us why we fought for the oppressors. That set us thinking."<ref>Lincoln, p. 495.</ref>

==Impact of Kronstadt==

===Walter Krivitsky's concept of "Kronstadt"===
In 1939, [[Isaac Don Levine]] introduced [[Whittaker Chambers]] to [[Walter Krivitsky]] in [[New York City]].  First, Krivitsky asked, "Is the Soviet Government a fascist government?" to which Chambers assented, "You are right, and Kronstadt was the turning point."  Chambers explained:  <blockquote>From Kronstadt during the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the sailors of the Baltic Fleet had steamed their cruisers to aid the Communists in capturing Petrograd.  Their aid had been decisive.... They were the first Communists to realize their mistake and the first to try to correct it.  When they saw that Communism meant terror and tyranny, they called for the overthrow of the Communist Government and for a time imperiled it.  They were bloodily destroyed or sent into Siberian slavery by Communist troops led in person by the Commissar of War, Leon Trotsky, and by Marshal Tukhachevsky, one of whom was later assassinated, the other executed, by the regime they then saved.

Krivitsky meant that by the decision to destroy the Kronstadt sailors, and by its cold-blooded action in doing so, Communism had made the choice that changed it from benevolent socialism to malignant fascism.<ref name=Witness>

===Louis Fischer's concept of "Kronstadt"===
The 1949 book ''[[The God That Failed]]'' contains [[Louis Fischer]]'s definition of "Kronstadt" as the moment in which communists or [[fellow-traveler]]s decide not just to leave the Communist Party but to oppose it as [[anti-communism|anti-communists]].  Editor [[Richard Crossman]] said in the book's introduction:  "The Kronstadt rebels called for Soviet power free from Bolshevik dominance"  (p. x).  After describing the actual Kronstadt rebellion, Fischer spent many pages applying the concept to subsequent former-communists <U+2014> including himself:  "What counts decisively is the 'Kronstadt.'  Until its advent, one might waver emotionally or doubt intellectually or even reject the cause altogether in one's mind, and yet refuse to attack it.  I had no 'Kronstadt' for many years." (p.&nbsp;204).

===Others===
Writers who subsequently picked up the term have included [[Clark Kerr]], [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]], [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]], and [[Norman Podhoretz]].
