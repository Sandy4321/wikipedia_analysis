'''Crater Lake''' is a [[caldera]] [[lake]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]]. It is the main feature of [[Crater Lake National Park]] and famous for its deep blue color and water clarity. The lake partly fills a nearly 4,000 feet (1,220&nbsp;m) deep caldera that was formed around 5,677 (&plusmn; 150) BC<ref>{{cite web | title = Crater Lake | publisher = Global Volcanism Program, Smithsonian Institution | url = http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=1202-16- | accessdate = 2006-12-26}}</ref> by the collapse of the volcano [[Mount Mazama]]. 

On [[June 12]], [[1853]], [[John Wesley Hillman]] was reportedly the first [[European American]] to see what he named "Deep Blue Lake" in Oregon. The lake was renamed at least three times, as Blue Lake, Lake Majesty, and finally Crater Lake.<ref>{{cite book

Crater Lake is known for its famous piece of [[driftwood]] named the "[[Old Man of the Lake]]." It is a full-sized tree that has been bobbing vertically in the lake for more than a century.<ref> Kartchnerand, W.E. & Doerr, J.E., Jr., "Wind Currents In Crater Lake As Revealed By The Old Man Of The Lake," ''[http://www.nps.gov/archive/crla/notes/vol11-3c.htm Nature Notes from Crater Lake National Park]'', Vol. XI, No. 3 (September 1938).</ref> Due to the cold water of the lake, the tree has been rather well preserved.

While having no indigenous fish population, the lake was stocked from 1888 to 1941 with a variety of fish.  Several species have formed self sustaining populations.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Fish of Crater Lake | publisher = National Park Service | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/crla/fish.htm | accessdate = 2007-02-23}}</ref>

The commemorative Oregon [[State Quarters|State Quarter]], which was released by the [[United States Mint]] in [[2005]], features an image of Crater Lake on its reverse side. <ref>{{cite web | title = The Oregon Quarter: The United States Mint | publisher = U.S. Department of the Treasury  | url = http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/50sq_program/states/index.cfm?state=OR | accessdate = 2007-06-29}}</ref>

==Dimensions and depth==
The lake is 5 by 6 miles (8 by 9.6&nbsp;km) across with an average depth of 1,148 feet (350&nbsp;m). Its deepest point has been measured at 1,949 feet (594&nbsp;m) deep,<ref>{{cite web | title = Facts about Crater Lake | publisher = U.S. Geological Survey | url = http://craterlake.wr.usgs.gov/facts.html | accessdate = 2006-11-23}}</ref> though as with any lake its depth fluctuates with the climate, particularly rainfall.<ref>{{cite web | first = Helen | last = Gibbons | title = CMG Maps Bottom of Crater Lake, Oregon | publisher = U.S. Geological Survey  | date = September, 2000 | url = http://soundwaves.usgs.gov/2000/09/fieldwork.html | accessdate = 2006-11-23}}</ref>  This makes Crater Lake the deepest lake in the [[United States]], the second deepest lake in [[North America]] ([[Great Slave Lake]] is the deepest) and the seventh deepest lake in the world ([[Lake Baikal]] is the deepest).  It also holds the honor of being the deepest lake in the world that is completely above sea level.  The caldera rim ranges in elevation from 7,000 to 8,000 feet (2,130 to 2,440&nbsp;m).

==Geology==
:<div class="noprint">''Main article&#58; [[Mount Mazama#Geology|Mount Mazama]]</div>
[[Image:Geologic map of Crater Lake floor.png|thumb|left|Geologic map of the lake floor]]
[[Mount Mazama]], part of the [[Cascade Range]] [[volcanic arc]], was built up mostly of [[andesite]], [[dacite]], and [[rhyodacite]] over a period of at least 400,000 years. The [[caldera]] was created in a massive [[volcanic eruption]] that lead to the subsidence of Mount Mazama around [[6th millennium BC|5700 BC]]: about 50 cubic kilometers (12&nbsp;cubic&nbsp;miles) of [[rhyodacite]] was erupted in this event. Since that time, all eruptions on Mazama have been confined to the caldera.

Lava eruptions later created a central platform, [[Wizard Island]], Merriam Cone, and other, smaller volcanic features, including a [[rhyodacite]] dome that was eventually created atop the central platform. Sediments and [[landslide]] debris also covered the caldera floor. 

In time, the caldera cooled, allowing [[rain]] and [[snow]] to accumulate and eventually form a lake. Landslides from the caldera rim thereafter formed debris fans and [[turbidite]] sediments on the lake bed. [[Fumarole]]s and [[hot spring]]s remained common and active during this period. 

Also after some time, the slopes of the lake's caldera rim more or less stabilized, [[stream]]s restored a radial drainage pattern on the [[mountain]], and dense [[forest]]s began to revegetate the barren landscape. 

Some hydrothermal activity remains along the lake floor, suggesting that at sometime in the future Mazama may erupt once again.<ref>{{cite web | title = Geologic History of Crater Lake | publisher = U.S. Geological Survey | url = http://craterlake.wr.usgs.gov/geology.html | accessdate = 2006-11-23}}</ref>

==Water quality==
[[Image:Aerial Crater Lake.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Crater Lake]]
Due to several unique factors, most prominently that it has no inlets or tributaries, the waters of Crater Lake are some of the purest in terms of the absence of pollutants in North America.

[[Secchi disk]] clarity readings have consistently been in the high-20&nbsp;meter to mid-30&nbsp;meter (80-115&nbsp;ft) range, which is very clear for any natural body of water.  In  1997, scientists recorded a record clarity of 43.3 meters (142&nbsp;ft).

The lake traditionally has relatively high levels of dissolved salts, total alkalinity, and conductivity. The average [[pH]] has generally ranged between 7 and 8. <ref>{{cite web | title = Facts and Figures about Crater Lake | publisher = U.S. National Park Service | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/crla/brochures/facts.htm | accessdate = 2007-06-24}}</ref>

==Sacred significance==

The local [[Klamath]] tribe of [[Native Americans]] who witnessed the collapse of [[Mount Mazama]] and formation of Crater Lake have long regarded Crater Lake as a sacred site. Their legends and lore tells us the story of two chiefs who were engaged in a battle against each other. That battle resulted in the destruction of one of the chiefs' home, Mt. Mazama, and the creation of Crater Lake. The Klamath people also used Crater Lake in [[vision quests]] which often involved climbing the caldera walls and other dangerous tasks. Those who were successful in such quests were often regarded as having more spiritual powers. Even today, the tribe still holds Crater Lake in high regard as a spiritual site.
