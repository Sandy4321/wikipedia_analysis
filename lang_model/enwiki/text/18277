'''''The Wedding March''''' ([[1928 in film|1928]]) is a [[silent film]] directed by and starring [[Erich von Stroheim]]. It also stars [[Fay Wray]] and [[ZaSu Pitts]]. [[Paramount Pictures]] forced von Stroheim to create two films from the footage, the second being ''The Honeymoon'' (eventually re-edited back into one film for a re-release). ''The Honeymoon'' is now a [[lost film]], the only known copy destroyed in a fire in [[France]] in 1957. <ref>[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/W/WeddingMarch1928.html ''The Wedding March'' at silentera.com database]</ref> <ref>''The American Film Institute Catalog Feature Films: 1921-30'' by The American Film Institute, c. 1971</ref>

==Production==
===Pre-production===
Shortly after completing ''[[The Merry Widow (1925 film)|The Merry Widow]]'' and having had a bad working experience at [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer]], Stroheim met independent film producer [[Pat Powers (businessman)|Pat Powers]] and convinced Powers to finance ''The Wedding March''.<ref> Lennig, Arthur. Stroheim. The University Press of Kentucky. 2000. ISBN 0-8131-2138-8. pp. 238-239.</ref> Stroheim's script was completed by March 1926 and was 154 pages long. The currently available version of the film depicts the first 67 pages of the original script.<ref>Lennig. pp. 239.</ref>

As was often the case with films directed by Stroheim, the films accuracy resulted in high expenses and production value. Stroheim rebuilt huge sets for [[St. Stephen's Cathedral]], the streets surrounding it, various palatial rooms and an entire apple orchard with thousands of blommons individually tied to the trees. Stroheim defended his elaborate set choices by stating "They say I give them sewers <U+2014> and dead cats! This time I am giving them beauty. Beauty <U+2014> and apple blossoms! More than they can stand!"<ref>Lennig. pp. 240.</ref>

===Filming===
Shooting began in June 1926 and lasted until Stroheim was finally shut down by Powers in january 1927. A reporter allowed onto the films set reported about stroheim's perfectionism and indifference to time and money, and stated that Stroheim once told his cast and crew that if necessary they would film 24,000 takes of a scene until they got it right.<ref>Lennig. pp. 240.</ref> Over the six months of filming, Stroheim shot over 200,000 feet of film.<ref>Lennig. pp. 241.</ref>

===Editing===
In January 1927 Stroheim screened the footage for Powers and began to edit the film, wanted to release two separate films that would be shown on consecutive nights. His initial cut of part 1 was 25,795 feet long (a little over four hours), after which he refused to cut the film further and Powers took control of the film. Powers had convinced [[Paramount Studios]] to distribute the film and, after not being sure how to release it after twelve months of editing, they finished a shorter cut of the entire two-part film in January 1928. Paramount hired film director [[Joseph von Sternberg]] to re-edit the film to a more manageable length. Studio records show that Stroheim approved of Sternberg, but Stroheim later partially blamed Sternberg for the film's re-cutting.<ref>Lennig. pp. 244.</ref> Stroheim's first cut of part two was 22,484 feet. he then cut the it down to between 15,000 and 20,000 feet before the studio and Sternberg made their cut. Only 4,500 feet of Stroheim's original cut was used in the final film.<ref>Lennig. pp. 262.</ref> In 1947 Stroheim claimed that he had finished editing the first part of the film, but never completed the second part after it was given to Sternberg. He also said that the film's final budget was $900,000 and that powers and Paramount made a profit from the film, while he was denied his contractural 25% of the film's gross.<ref>Lennig. pp. 243.</ref> This statement is untrue and the film's final budget, taking two years of interest, the film's color sequences, and creating sound disks for the release into account, was well over a million dollars.<ref>Lennig. pp. 244.</ref>

''The Wedding March'' was previewed at the Egyptian Theater in Long Beach, CA the following March.<ref>Lennig. pp. 242.</ref> After the disastrous preview Paramount decided to release ''The Wedding March'' as two films after all, with part two being re-titled ''The Honeymoon''. ''The Wedding March'' was 14 reels long and ''The Honeymoon'' was 8 reels long. The first 3 reels of ''The Honeymoon'' was footage from ''The Wedding March'' that was used as exposition. Only 5 reels of Stroheims original footage of the second half of ''The Wedding March'' was used, which amounted to approximately 50 minutes and was only one fifth of Stroheim's original cut.<ref>Lennig. pp. 243.</ref>

==Reception==
''The Wedding March'' was released in october 1928, while ''The Honeymoon'' was only released in Europe and South America several months later. <ref>Lennig. pp. 243.</ref> It was a box office failure and was released just as silent films were beginning to become unsuccessful after "[[sound films|talkies]]" had taken over the film market. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "a ponderous, slow moving production."<ref>Lennig. pp. 245.</ref>

==Legacy==
In 1950 [[Henri Langlois]] of the [[Cin<U+00E9>math<U+00E8>que Fran<U+00E7>aise]] gave Stroheim the opportunity to re-edit ''The wedding March'' and ''The Honeymoon'' from prints that he owned. Stroheim added sound effects and put certain scenes back in his original order.<ref>Lennig. pp. 246.</ref> The last known copy of ''The Honeymoon'' was destroyed in a fire at Cin<U+00E9>math<U+00E8>que Fran<U+00E7>aise in 1957, five days after Stroheim had died. Langlois claimed that the film "died voluntarily."<ref>Lennig. pp. 243.</ref>

The film's reputation began to grow after Stroheim's death. Langlois presented the film at the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] in 1965, calling it a film "like a torso without a head."<ref>Lennig. pp. 246.</ref> The film was screened at the 3rd [[New York Film Festival]], where it was mostly received favorably. However [[Bosley Crowther]] called it "disappointing".<ref>Lennig. pp. 260.</ref> It was screened at the Lincoln Center again in 1970 and received a standing ovation.<ref>Lennig. pp. 246.</ref>

Paramount first released the film on VHS in 1987. However they replaced [[J. S. Zamecnik]]'s full orchestral score with a new pipe organ score.<ref>Lennig. pp. 246.</ref> 

In 2003, ''The Wedding March'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant".
