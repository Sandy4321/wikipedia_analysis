Messi began playing football at a young age and his potential was quickly identified by FC Barcelona. He left [[Rosario]]-based [[Newell's Old Boys]]'s youth team in 2000 and moved with his family to Europe, as Barcelona offered treatment for his [[growth hormone deficiency]]. Making his debut in the [[La Liga 2004<U+2013>05|2004<U+2013>05 season]], he broke the [[Football records in Spain|La Liga record]] for the youngest footballer to play a league game, and also the youngest to score a league goal. Major honours soon followed as Barcelona won La Liga in Messi's debut season, and won [[The Double|a double]] of the league and [[UEFA Champions League 2004<U+2013>05|UEFA Champions League]] in 2006. His breakthrough season was in 2006<U+2013>07: he became a [[first team]] regular, scoring a [[Hat-trick#Association_football|hat-trick]] in [[El Cl<U+00E1>sico]] and finishing with 14 goals in 26 league games. Perhaps his most successful season was the [[La Liga 2008<U+2013>09|2008<U+2013>09 season]], in which Messi scored 38 goals to play an integral part in a [[The treble|treble]] winning campaign.

Messi was the top scorer with six goals, including two in the final game of the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship]]. Shortly thereafter, he became an established member of Argentina's senior international team. In 2006 he became the youngest Argentine to play in the [[FIFA World Cup]] and he won a runners-up medal at the [[Copa Am<U+00E9>rica 2007|Copa Am<U+00E9>rica]] tournament the following year. In Beijing in [[2008 Olympics|2008]] he won his first senior international honour, an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medal, with the [[Argentina Olympic football team]].

==Early life==
Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in [[Rosario]], [[Argentina]], to parents Jorge Messi, a [[factory worker]], and Celia (n<U+00E9>e Cuccitini), a part-time [[cleaner]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/deportes/8-121094-2009-03-07.html | last = Veiga | first = Gustavo | publisher = Pagina 12 | title = Los intereses de Messi | accessdate = 2009-05-31|language= Spanish}}</ref><ref name="mission">{{cite web | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article3779961.ece | publisher = Times Online | title = Lionel Messi on a mission| last = Hawkey | first = Ian | date = 2008-04-20| accessdate = 2009-05-30}}</ref> His paternal family originates from the [[Italy|Italian]] city of [[Ancona]] where his ancestor, Angelo Messi, emigrated to Argentina in 1883.<ref name="El origen de los Messi"/><ref name="Las ra<U+00ED>ces italianas de Leo Messi"/> He has two older brothers named Rodrigo and Mat<U+00ED>as as well as a sister named Maria Sol.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nbcolympics.com/athletes/athlete=1246/bio/ | publisher = NBC | title = Lionel Messi bio | accessdate = 2009-05-30}}</ref> At the age of five, Messi started playing football for Grandoli, a local club coached by his father Jorge.<ref name=Williams/> In 1995, Messi switched to [[Newell's Old Boys]] who were based in his home city Rosario.<ref name=Williams>{{cite web | last = Williams | first = Richard | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2006/feb/24/championsleague1 | publisher = The Guardian | title = Messi has all the qualities to take world by storm | accessdate = 2008-05-03 | date = 2006-02-26}}</ref> At the age of 11, he was diagnosed with a [[growth hormone deficiency]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/championsleague/5099857/Franck-Ribery-the-man-to-challenge-Lionel-Messi-and-Barcelona.html | title = Franck Ribery the man to challenge Lionel Messi and Barcelona | publisher = Daily Telegraph | last = White | first = Duncan | date = 2009-04-04 | accessdate = 2009-07-07}}</ref> [[Primera Divisi<U+00F3>n Argentina|Primera Divisi<U+00F3>n]] club [[Club Atl<U+00E9>tico River Plate|River Plate]] showed interest in Messi's progress, but did not have enough money to pay for the treatment, as it cost $900 a month.<ref name="mission"/> [[Carles Rexach]], the sporting director of [[FC Barcelona]], had been made aware of his talent as Messi had relatives in [[Catalonia]], and Messi and his father were able to arrange a trial.<ref name="mission"/> FC Barcelona signed him after watching him play,<ref name=fifa.com/> offering to pay for the medical bills if he was willing to move to Spain.<ref name=Williams/> His family moved to Europe and he started in the club's youth teams.<ref name=fifa.com>{{cite news |url=http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=107/edition=248388/news/newsid=103182.html |title=The new messiah
