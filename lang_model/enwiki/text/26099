'''''Butterfly''''', the sixth [[studio album]] by American singer-songwriter [[Mariah Carey]], was released on September 16, 1997, by [[Columbia Records]]. It contained both [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] sounds, as well as some softer and more contemporary melodies. Throughout the project, Carey worked with [[Walter Afanasieff]], with whom she had written and produced most of the material from her previous albums. She also worked with many famed hip-hop producers and [[Rapping|rappers]], such as [[Sean Combs|Sean "Puffy" Combs]], [[Kamaal Fareed]], [[Missy Elliott]] and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from [[Trackmasters]]. With the latter acts producing most of the album, ''Butterfly'' deviated from the formula of Carey's older work, and was hailed as a defining album of the 1990s and of hip-hop and R&B music.

Upon release, the album received positive reviews from music critics, who embraced Carey's musical transition. Reviewers complimented the album for its mature sound and production, and commended Carey's musical direction, calling the work a "transitional album, one that makes her a rarity of the 90s."<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r314312/review|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic ((( Butterfly > Review )))|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2010-09-07}}</ref> ''Butterfly'' was a life-altering album for Carey, continuing the transformation that began with her previous release, ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]''. The album pushed her music into a hip-hop and R&B sound, leading her away from her contemporary-pop background. Though released during Carey's conflict with [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]], the album became a commercial success, topping the charts in Australia, Japan and the Netherlands. On the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], it debuted at number one, spending one week atop the chart. ''Butterfly'' was nominated for three [[40th Grammy Awards|Grammy Awards]], but did not win any. The album was certified five-times [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), and received the [[List of best-selling albums in Japan|Million Award]] in Japan.

Five singles were released from the album. "[[Honey (Mariah Carey song)|Honey]]", the album's lead single, topped the charts in the US and Canada, and reached the top-five in New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom. The album's fourth single, "[[My All]]", became a top-ten hit throughout Europe. When "My All" topped the chart in the US, it became her thirteenth number-one single surpassing [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] as the female with the most chart toppers on the [[Hot 100]]. To support the album, Carey embarked on the "[[Butterfly World Tour]]", which visited Australia, Japan and Taiwan, with one show in the United States. According to the booklet from Carey's twelfth studio album, ''[[Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel]]'',  she considered ''Butterfly'' her ''[[magnum opus]]'' and a serious turning point in both her life and career.

== Background ==
During ''Butterfly'''s development in mid-1997 Carey separated from  her  husband, music executive [[Tommy Mottola]], who had guided her career since 1988; the couple later divorced. Press speculation on the break-up had been fueled as Carey began to take personal control of her career.<ref name="shapiro2">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|p=99<U+2013>100}}</ref> Throughout the project, she worked with a cast of various rappers and hip-hop producers, including [[Sean Combs|Sean "Puffy" Combs]], [[Kamaal Fareed]], [[Missy Elliott]] and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from [[Trackmasters]].<ref name="shapiro2"/> Critics claimed that  Carey's new production team was her way of seeking revenge on Mottola and [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]].<ref name="shapiro2"/> In an interview with [[What's on TV|What's On]] magazine, Carey denied that the direction she was taking was radically new, and insisted that her new album's direction was of her own choosing. Her actions caused a commotion in Sony's headquarters, where there were fears that Carey was jeopardizing the success of their "best-selling act".<ref name="shapiro3">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|p=101}}</ref> Carey expressed resentment  that despite her successful career, Sony, at that time  run by Mottola, did not allow her to make music she was passionate about.<ref name="shapiro3"/>

{{Quote box|width=35%|align=right|style=padding:8px|quote="In the past, people were scared to let me explore different types of music that I loved and enjoyed. They [the studio heads] saw me as having this instrument, and they wanted to get the most use out of it. There were allot<!--sic?--> of people around me who were afraid of change. I was a valuable commodity, and they didn't want to lose that. I was encouraged to act drab, because drab sells records."|source=<U+2014>Carey, on her conflict with Sony Music.<ref name="shapiro2"/>
 }}
The pressure of facing life on her own, and becoming a constant "media fodder," began taking its toll on Carey. Due to stress and growing creative differences, Carey and Afanasieff stopped collaborating during this period.<ref name="shapiro3"/> Reportedly, one night after a long recording session at the Hit Factory, they began a heated argument over the album's direction; their relationship "ended broken."<ref name="shapiro2"/> In addition to the problems arising from this fall-out, Carey found herself under media criticism for her "new crowd of rappers and producers".<ref name="shapiro2"/> Stories appeared in tabloids, linking Carey to several rappers and claiming her decisions had been made purely for sexual purposes.<ref name="shapiro2"/> In an interview with ''[[France Soir]]'', she denied the allegations and said that the only man she had slept with was her husband.<ref name="shapiro4">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|p=104}}</ref>

''Butterfly'' proved to be Carey's most expressive and mature album at that point. With a new musical direction and a slew of different writers and producers, the album was "set to be a hit."<ref name="shapiro3"/> Carey and Combs wrote the lead single, "[[Honey (Mariah Carey song)|Honey]]". Combs was very confident with the song, calling it "slammin{{'"}}, but because of its heavy hip-hip influence, he felt only cautiously optimistic about the song's commercial success.<ref name="shapiro3"/> The remix for "Honey" featured [[rapping|rap]] leads from [[Da Brat]] and [[Mase]], with some verses rapped by Combs himself. The track was very different than anything Carey had ever recorded, and was described as "street Hip-Hop music, with a booming [[Bass (sound)|bass]]."<ref name="nickson">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=166}}</ref> The song's melody was driven by [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]]'s [[drum]] programming and [[Stevie J]]'s [[Musical keyboard|keyboard]] notes. Combs's production gave the song a "light and airy" effect, further distancing it from Carey's [[Contemporary classical music|contemporary sound]].<ref name="nickson"/> "Honey" featured [[Sampling (music)|musical samples]] from [[Treacherous Three]]'s "The Body Rock", and "Hey DJ" from the [[World's Famous Supreme Team]].<ref name="nickson"/> The track united hip-hop and R&B with traces of pop music and was described as a "[song with a] catchy chorus, combining hip-hop and pop into something that simply wasn't going to be denied by anyone, and offering a powerful start to a record."<ref name="nickson"/>

The album's second single, "[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey song)|Butterfly]]", was one of the [[ballad]]s Carey wrote with Afanasieff.<ref name="nickson"/> Carey described the song as her "favorite ballad she had ever written", one that was different and more personal than anything she had  produced in the past.<ref name="nickson2">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=167}}</ref> Afanasieff, who composed the music with [[Dan Shea (record producer)|Dan Shea]], handled the song's [[instrumental]]s, and added a few personal R&B touches. Another ballad Carey wrote with Afanasieff was "[[My All]]", one written as a contrast to the album's general hip-hop flavor.<ref name="nickson2"/> Carey described the song as having "a lush sound and intense styling".<ref name="nickson2"/> It featured guitar [[arpeggios]], which were synthetically created with the clever use of sampling and playing keyboard notes.<ref name="nickson"/> "[[The Roof (song)|The Roof]]", the album's European release, enhanced the album's palette. The song incorporated fragments from [[Mobb Deep]]'s "[[Shook Ones (Part II)]]" into its sound, and was produced by Carey, [[Trackmasters|Poke & Tone]] and [[Cory Rooney]].<ref name="nickson2"/>
{{Quote box|width=22%|align=left|style=padding:8px|quote="I had the hook already, as well as a melody and lyric for the chorus. Then she and I collaborated on a new melody for the verses, and we did the first verse, and the second half of the second verse together."|source=<U+2014>Carey, on working with Elliott on "Babydoll."<ref name="shapiro2"/>
 }}
"Fourth of July", one of the album's slower ballads, was also written solely by Carey and Afanasieff.<ref name="nickson2"/> Though not a single, the song received notice for its [[jazz]]y sound. It was compared to some of Carey's older work such as "Vanishing" and "The Wind", but was said to be "less straight-forward, with more of a swing and even a touch of class."<ref name="nickson2"/> The next two tracks on the album, "[[Breakdown (Mariah Carey song)|Breakdown]]" and "Babydoll", were described as "the album's backbone, its real declaration of independence".<ref name="nickson2"/>  "Breakdown" was written by Carey and Puffy and  included rap verses from Wish and Krayzie Bone from [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]].<ref name="nickson3">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=168}}</ref> Author Chris Nickson wrote that "'Breakdown' showed Mariah treading forcefully into territory that was new for her and making it her own."<ref name="nickson3"/> For "Babydoll", Carey teamed up with Elliott. The track was recorded in Atlanta, where Elliott resided, and included background vocals from Carey's long-time friend, [[Trey Lorenz]]. "Babydoll" was described as "a vocally driven piece", with some "inventive drum programming" provided by Rooney.<ref name="nickson3"/> Other songs which incorporated R&B influence into "exquisite balladry" were "Whenever You Call" and "Close My Eyes", which were personally important to Carey. While both were standard ballads in comparison to what Carey had done in the past, Nickson had the following to say regarding them.<ref name="nickson3"/>
<blockquote>
"While up to to the standard of anything Mariah had ever done before, [they] suffered in comparison. But even here you could hear the new Mariah in the spareness of the arrangements and the way it was her voice, rather than any instrument, that controlled the song. She'd grown to the point where having less behind her really proved to be more, for the song and for her. It was notable, too, that like the other ballads on the record, these two leaned very much towards R&B."<ref name="nickson3"/>
</blockquote>

Carey wrote the song "Fly Away (Butterfly reprise)" with famed [[house music]] producer [[David Morales]].<ref name="nickson4">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=169}}</ref> When she wrote the concept for "Butterfly", it was was intended to be a house music record, but after writing the lyrics and making the song with Morales, she preferred to make it a ballad. Carey expressed a desire to feature her concept both on the house record, alongside the ballad that would become "Butterfly".<ref name="nickson4"/> Morales took Carey's lyrics, concept and melody and added a "thumping house beat," to it "propelling some inventive keyboard and vocal work, and showing yet another new facet of Mariah."<ref name="nickson4"/> For the album, Carey recorded a version of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s "[[The Beautiful Ones]]", featuring [[Dru Hill]]'s lead singer [[Sisq<U+00F3>]]. The song was one of the last recorded tracks and was the only non-original song on the album.<ref name="nickson4"/> ''Butterfly'' came to a close with "Outside", a ballad that was written by Carey, Afanasieff and Rooney.<ref name="nickson4"/>

The album received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised Carey's musical transformation and direction.<ref name="allmusic"/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from [[Allmusic]] complimented it for its mature sound as well as its powerful and well-crafted balladry, writing that "Carey's vocals are sultrier and more controlled than ever, and that helps 'Butterfly', 'Break Down', 'Babydoll', and the Prince cover, 'The Beautiful Ones', rank among her best; also, the ballads do have a stronger urban feel than before."<ref name="allmusic"/> Erlewine went on to proclaim ''Butterfly'' as one of Carey's best records and said that "Carey is continuing to improve and refine her music, which makes her a rarity among her '90s peers."<ref name="allmusic"/> [[Nathan Brackett]], senior editor of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', praised ''Butterfly'', complimenting the album's producers and Carey's "more controlled" vocals.<ref name="rs">{{cite book |last= Brackett |first= Nathan |coauthors= |title= The new Rolling Stone album guide|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster|Fireside]] |page=138|year= 2004 |month= November |isbn= 978-0743201698}}</ref> While recognizing the album's positive facets, Brackett noticed a connection between much of Carey's lyrics and her separation from Mottola.<ref name="rs"/> Rich Juzwiak from ''[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]'' awarded the album a score of four and a half out of five stars, calling it "elegant" and praising Carey's mature vocals.<ref name="slant">{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=339|title=Music Review: Mariah Carey: Butterfly|last=Juzwiak|first=Rich|publisher=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=2003-12-18|accessdate=2010-09-07}}</ref> Juzwiak particularly praised "Breakdown", which he called one of the album's best tracks. Regarding Carey's [[Breathy voice|breathy vocals]], he wrote, "The relatively high and thin register that she sings in when not belting (and that's often) could be the most important of Butterfly's changes, as it marks the first time that Mariah the vocalist seems consistently real. She's utterly soulful."<ref name="slant"/>

[[David Browne]] from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave ''Butterfly'' a B- in his review.<ref name="ew">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,289461,00.html|title=Music Review&nbsp;<U+2013> Mariah Carey: Butterfly|last=Browne|first=David|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=1997-09-19|accessdate=2010-09-07}}</ref> Browne commented on Carey's vocals: "In ''Breakdown'', she demonstrates she can match the [[staccato]], lite-reggae phrasing of her guests, two members of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony."<ref name="ew"/> However, Browne commented negatively on Carey's outlook on a "more mature" sound, writing, "Oddly, Carey's attempt at musical maturity ends up backfiring. The very-slow-jam grooves have an intimacy lacking in her previous work. But the arrangements&nbsp;<U+2013> especially the oozing vocal harmonies on many tracks&nbsp;<U+2013> mute the impact of her lyrics. How are we supposed to connect with Carey's renewal when we can barely understand what she's singing? Butterfly is undeniably pleasant, with little of the all-conquering bombast usually associated with Carey. But it's also the last thing anyone would have expected from her: blandly self-effacing."<ref name="ew"/> In his consumer guide for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', critic [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album a "dud" rating,<ref name="rc">{{cite web|url=http://robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=mariah+carey|title=Robert Christgau: CG: Mariah Carey|last=Christgau|first=Robert|publisher=RobertChristgau.com|year=1997|accessdate=2010-09-07}}</ref> indicating "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg90/grades-90s.php|title=CG Grades: 1990s-|last=Christgau|first=Robert|publisher=RobertChristgau.com|date=|accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref>

<Blockquote>
"The song of Carey's career, where the lyrical strokes are as broad and obvious as they are naked. Mariah the chanter flawlessly adapts to their singsong style, largely boxing her multi-octave range into a sly, hypnotic melody so that when she really wails at the end, you really feel it. Carey lunges toward musical maturity by embracing, not shunning hip-hop. This is the height of her elegance and maybe hip-hop-soul's, too."<ref name="slant"/>

Originally, Carey had not planned to tour, as she had received a mixed response in the US with her [[Music Box Tour]], and prior to that, she had already successfully toured through Europe and Asia with the [[Daydream World Tour]]. However, after the album's release, many fans asked Carey to tour, especially in Asia and Australia.<ref name="nickson5"/> Accordingly, Carey embarked on the [[Butterfly World Tour]]; her third head-lining tour. The tour dated eleven shows, four in Japan's largest stadium, [[Tokyo Dome]], one in Taiwan, five in Australia and one in the United States.<ref name="nickson6">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=171}}</ref> The tickets for her shows in Japan sold out, with all 200,000 tickets being sold in under one hour.<ref name="nickson6"/> The rest of the tour was also very successful, selling out each of its eleven dates.<ref name="nickson6"/> As part of her most extensive tour until that point, Carey performed a sold out show at the 50,000-capacity [[Aloha Stadium]] in Hawaii, where she filmed her concert video, ''[[Around the World (video)|Around the World]]''. The video was a one tour-compilation DVD which included parts of Carey's shows in Japan, Australia and Hawaii.<ref name="nickson6"/> The tour became a critical and commercial success, with fans and critics alike raving about the tour's quality and Carey's vocals.<ref name="shapiro6">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|p=110}}</ref>

== Awards and accolades ==
''Butterfly'' was declared "one of Carey's best records to date", and received many prestigious awards throughout the industry. At the [[Billboard Music Award]]s, Carey received an honorary award, recognizing her achievement of earning "The Most Number-one Singles Ever by a Female Solo Artist in History".<ref name="shapiro7"/> "Honey" was nominated at the 1998 [[Grammy Awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance|Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]], while "Butterfly" was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]].<ref name="shapiro7">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|p=161<U+2013>163}}</ref> The album won a [[Japan Gold Disc Award]] in the "International Pop Album of the Year" category. For ''Butterfly'', Carey won the [[American Music Award]] for [[American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Female Artist|Favorite Soul/R&B Female Artist]] in 1998. Additionally, the album won the [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Pop Award for "Songwriter of the Year" and the "Songwriter" awards for "Honey", "Butterfly" and "My All".<ref name="shapiro7"/> At the [[Soul Train Music Awards]] in 1998, Carey won the awards for "Entertainer of the Year" and "Soul Train Lady of Soul", which were presented to her by [[Aretha Franklin]].<ref name="shapiro7"/>

''Butterfly'' was nominated at the 1998 [[NAACP Image Awards]], in the "Outstanding Female Artist" category.<ref name="nickson5"/> At the [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster Entertainment Awards]], Carey was named the "Song-writer of the Year", and received the "Song of the Year" award. At the 1998 [[World Music Awards]], Carey won two of night's top awards; the "World's Best-selling R&B Artist" and the "World's Best-selling Recording Artist of the 90s".<ref name="shapiro7"/> Carey expressed resentment towards the Grammys, having been shut out again from any wins. However, during this period, Carey was in the midst of her tour, something she claimed helped her cope with the loss. According to author Marc Shapiro, "she was on tour, her fans loved her, and at least she didn't have to sit through the whole awards ceremony and then come away empty-handed. No amount of awards could replace the popular acceptance of ''Butterfly'' and the feeling she was now free to live her own life&nbsp;<U+2013> creatively and personally."<ref name="shapiro6"/> In a recent list voted in by various rock critics, ''Butterfly'' was selected as one of the [[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/steveparker/1001albums.htm |title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die |publisher=Rocklistmusic.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-09-26}}</ref>

=== Reaction to "Honey" video ===
The lead single from the album, "[[Honey (Mariah Carey song)|Honey]]", gained worldwide attention for pushing Carey farther into [[hip hop|hip-hop]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] than ever before.<ref name="nickson8">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=161<U+2013>162}}</ref> Aside from the attention surrounding the song, the music video garnered much speculation. For the first time in her career, Carey was featured provocatively dressed, giving viewers a "taste of the freer Mariah".<ref name="nickson8"/>
{{Quote box|width=35%|align=right|style=padding:8px|quote="It was a grueling process; I'm not going to say it was easy. I got up at 3 A.M. every day, and worked until 9 in the morning the next day <U+2013> for four hours in a row, swimming in my Gucci pumps! I can't say that I really jumped off the roof, but [I did] dive into the pool. But I did wear and swim in those pumps, and I was not happy"|source=<U+2014>Carey, on her exhausting experience on the set of "Honey."<ref name="nickson8"/>
 }}
The [[Puerto Rico]]-filmed video's concept was created by Carey with [[Paul Hunter (director)|Paul Hunter]] filling in as the director.<ref name="nickson8"/> Serving a [[James Bond]] theme, Carey was cast as "the very sexy agent M", a woman who escapes a large mansion in which she has been held captive.<ref name="nickson8"/> Carey said of the video that "I don't really think the video is overtly sexual, but for me-I mean people used to think I was the nineties version of Mary Poppins!"<ref name="nickson"/>
[[Image:Mariah-carey-the-roof.jpg|thumb|left|240px|A still from "The Roof" showing a wet Carey in the back of a limousine]]
During the time of the video's release, Carey and Mottola were in the midst of their divorce which led to speculation on the video's message. Tabloids and critics were linking the video's theme to Carey's marriage, writing how Mottola would lock her in their mansion.<ref name="nickson8"/> While she denied the allegations, many found it to be very obvious. Carey's writing partner of six years, Afanasieff, felt the video was undeniably about Mottola.<ref name="nickson8"/> While speculation about the video grew, Carey continued to deny any intention of portraying her marriage in the video.<ref name="nickson8"/> In an interview, Carey said that "Tommy loves the video, he says it's my best video yet."<ref name="nickson8"/>

=== Music videos ===
The music video for "[[The Roof (song)|The Roof]]" garnered critical acclaim, and was ranked 18th on ''[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]'s'' "100 Greatest Music Videos".<ref name="100video">{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/feature/100-greatest-music-videos/205/page_9|title=100 Greatest Music Videos|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|publisher=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=2003-06-30|accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref> Sal Ciquemani, from ''Slant'', gave the video a positive review, complimenting Carey's choice to pair the sultry song with a "sophisticated tale of a sexy rooftop encounter."<ref name="100video"/> The video re-tells a story of Carey reminiscing a past love and a night they shared together on a rainy roof-top. The video's setting revolves around a dark limousine, a decrepit NYC apartment, and a rainy roof-top, where "Carey is featured at her most vulnerable, with runny mascara and drenched in the cold rainy night."<ref name="100video"/> In the conclusion of his review of the video, Ciquemani wrote: "When Carey rises through the limo's sunroof and relishes the warm November rain, she's not drunk on the bubbly but on the memory of past delights."<ref name="100video"/> The video for "My All" was also one of the more notable videos from ''Butterfly''.<ref name="nickson8"/> The video featured Carey in various scenery, such as a submerged vessel, a lighthouse and a large conch shell floating the shore.<ref name="nickson8"/> In each of the scenes, Carey is shown lamenting her love and yearning to be re-united with him once more.<ref name="nickson8"/> In the video's climax, Carey meets her love in the lighthouse, where they caress and drift into the "nights abyss."<ref name="nickson8"/> According to author Chris Nickson, the scenes of Carey on the overturned vessel showed her vulnerability without her loved one, truly emphasizing the yearning featured in the song.<ref name="nickson8"/>
