FFD was awarded a Phase I SBIR in 2011 and developed pressure garment glove technology under this contract. 

In July 2011, Final Frontier Design won third place in the ''2011 NewSpace Business Plan Competition'' in [[Silicon Valley]], sponsored by the [[Space Frontier Foundation]].<ref name="biznews">{{cite news|last=Wall|first=Mike|title=Satellite Grappler Snags Top Space Business Prize|url=http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/1297-altius-satellite-grapple-newspace-business-competition.html|accessdate=12 Jun 2012|newspaper=Business News Daily|date=4 Aug 2011}}</ref>[[File:Spacesuit-glove-final-front.jpg|thumb|EVA prototype glove with first in the world anthropomorphic fingertips, methacarpal joint and advanced gimbals wrist joint]]

Final Frontier Design was founded in 2010 <ref>[http://www.space.com/8782-private-spacesuit-unveiled-york-flair.html Article in space.com about releasing in July 2010 Prime Suit of FFD]</ref> by "artist and designer Ted Southern" and his partner Nikolay Moiseev, "a Russian mechanical engineer," with the intent to "craft affordable yet highly capable spacesuits for a burgeoning [[Private spaceflight|commercial spaceflight]] industry."<ref name=wired20120709>

Southern is a sculptor and costume designer who has built angel wings for Victoria<U+2019>s Secret; Moiseev boasts 20 years of experience working as a space suit designer for Zvezda, Russia<U+2019>s national space suit supplier. They placed second in the Astronaut Glove Challenge 2009, pulling in $100,000 in prize money for their pressurized glove technology.[[File:TedInSuit.jpg|thumb|FFD Second generation suit suit]]

==Intra-vehicular activity suit==

Final Frontier is developing a low-cost [[private spaceflight|commercial]] inside-the-spacecraft [[spacesuit]] called an ''Intra-Vehicular Activity suit'' (IVA) which can be pressurized in the event of an emergency, and is projecting to sell the suit at a price of about a fifth of the NASA cost for its existing line of IVA suits that cost around $250,000 each.  With the suit weighing a bit under {{convert|15|lbs}}<U+2014>versus 30 pounds with the NASA suit<U+2014>could result in economically significant reduction in fuel costs for a flight with a number of astronauts.<ref name=TBP20120706>

Final Frontier Design is building its third-generation spacesuit, according to the NASA flight certification standards. Its improvements over the second-generation spacesuit include the ability to withstand greater operating pressure, a carbon fiber waist ring, a retractable helmet, and improved gloves and glove disconnects.<ref>http://www.space.com/16197-spaceflight-startup-fund-spacesuits.html</ref>
The pair took to Kickstarter in June 2012 to raise money for the design and construction of a prototype commercial space suit for intra-vehicular travel <U+2014> meaning activities that take place inside a spacecraft. Final Frontier had raked in more than $27,000 in July 2012 from 386 backers, exceeding their $20,000 fundraising goal.  The goal of the Kickstarter project is to prep a third-generation suit to present to NASA for flight certification by 2013.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/post/next-level-spacesuits-brought-to-you-by-a-victorias-secret-designer-and-russian-engineer/2012/07/19/gJQAwkofvW_blog.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Gregory | last=Thomas | title=Next-level spacesuits, brought to you by a Victoria's Secret designer and Russian engineer | date=2012-07-20}}</ref>

==Space suit gloves==
Final Frontier Design developed, manufactured and tested space suit gloves:{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
*EVA glove for 4.3 psi (0.3 atm) operating pressure,
*EVA prototype glove for 8 psi (0.54 atm) operating pressure,
*IVA glove for 6 psi (0.4 atm) operating pressure.

All gloves have anthropomorphic fingertips excluding mitigating{{clarify|date=December 2012}} of nails, metacarpal joints, adjustable palm bar.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
