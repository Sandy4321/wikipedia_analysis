The '''2013<U+2013>14 season''' was the 92nd season of competitive association football and 77th season in [[the Football League]] played by [[York City F.C.]], an English football club based in [[York]], North Yorkshire. Their 17th place finish in the [[2012<U+2013>13 Football League Two|2012<U+2013>13 season]] meant it was their second consecutive season in [[Football League Two|League Two]]. The season ran from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014.

[[Nigel Worthington]], starting his first full season as York [[Manager (association football)|manager]], made eight permanent summer signings. By the turn of the year York were only above the relegation zone on [[goal difference]], before a 17 match unbeaten run saw the team finish in seventh position in the 24-team [[2013<U+2013>14 Football League Two]]. This meant York qualified for the [[2014 Football League play-offs#League Two|play-offs]], and they were eliminated in the semi-final by [[Fleetwood Town F.C.|Fleetwood Town]]. York were knocked out of the [[2013<U+2013>14 FA Cup]], [[2013<U+2013>14 Football League Cup|Football League Cup]] and [[2013<U+2013>14 Football League Trophy|Football League Trophy]] in their opening round matches.

35 players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were 12 different goalscorers. Defender [[Ben Davies (footballer, born 1995)|Ben Davies]] missed only five of the 52 competitive matches played over the season. [[Wes Fletcher]] finished as leading scorer with 13 goals, of which 10 came in league competition and three came in the FA Cup. The winner of the [[York City F.C. Clubman of the Year|Clubman of the Year]] award was [[Lanre Oyebanjo]].
