The '''Kingdom of Qocho''', (traditional Chinese: <U+754F><U+5140><U+5152>; simplified Chinese: <U+754F><U+5140><U+513F> ; pinyin: w<U+00E8>iw<U+00F9><U+00E9>r) (Mongolian {{MongolUnicode|<U+1826><U+1836><U+182D><U+1826><U+1837>}} ''{{lang|mvf-Latn|Uihur}}'') also called the '''Idiqut state''' ("Holy Wealth, Glory"), was an [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] state created during AD 856<U+2013>866, based in the cities of [[Gaochang|Qocho]] (also called Kara-Khoja) near [[Turpan]], [[Beshbalik]], [[Kumul (city)|Kumul]], and [[Kucha]].  Qocho serves as the winter capital with Beshbalik its summer capital.  It was also called '''Uyghuristan''' in its later period.

The kingdom was a Buddhist state, with state-sponsored [[Buddhism]] and [[Manichaeism]], and it can be considered the center of Uyghur culture.  The Uyghurs sponsored the construction of many of the temple caves in nearby [[Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves|Bezeklik]]. They abandoned their [[Old Turkic alphabet|old alphabet]] and adopted and modified the [[Sogdian alphabet|script of the Sogdians]], which later came to be known as the [[Old Uyghur alphabet|Uyghur script]].<ref>{{cite book |title=A history of Inner Asia |author=Svatopluk Soucek |chapter=Chapter 4 - The Uighur Kingdom of Qocho |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-521-65704-0 }}</ref> The Idiquts (title of the Karakhoja rulers) ruled independently until they become a [[vassal]] state of the [[Kara-Khitan]]s. In 1209, the Kara-Khoja ruler [[Baurchuk Art Tekin|Idiqut Barchuq]] declared his allegiance to the Mongols under [[Genghis Khan]], and the kingdom existed as a vassal state until 1335.  After submitting to the Mongols, the Uyghurs went into the service of the Mongol rulers as bureaucrats, providing the expertise that the initially illiterate nomads lacked.<ref>{{cite book |title=A history of Inner Asia |author=Svatopluk Soucek |chapter=Chapter 7 - The Conquering Mongols |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-521-65704-0 }}</ref> Qocho continued exist as a vassal to the Mongols of the [[Yuan dynasty]]. Qocho was finally conquered by the [[Chagatai Khanate]] in the 1390s.
