==Human history==
[[Image:Giuseppe Garibaldi (1866).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mount Garibaldi was named after [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] in 1860]]To the local [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|indigenous peoples]], the [[S<U+1E35>wxw<U+00FA>7mesh]], the mountain is called '''Nch'kay'''.  In their [[Skwxwu7mesh language|language]] it means "Dirty Places" or "Grimy One".<ref>[http://www.wildernesscommittee.org/campaigns/wildlands/stoltmann_wilderness/reports/Vol24No06/places2 Wilderness Committee - Kwa Kwayexwelh-Aynexws: Wild Spirit Places.] Retrieved [[2008-04-29]]</ref><ref>[http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/PubDocs/bcdocs/414673/d24044/1181338763782_401d3802844e42babeb6eb41577ab95b.pdf First Heritage Archaeological Consulting - Squamish Traditional Use Study] - Retrieved on [[2008-04-29]]</ref> The S<U+1E35>wxw<U+00FA>7mesh call Garibaldi ''Nch'kay'' because the water in the [[Cheekye River]] was muddy.<ref>[http://ilmbwww.gov.bc.ca/bcgn-bin/bcg10?name=5329 BCGNS Geography Name Details: Mount Garibaldi] Retrieved on [[2008-04-28]]</ref>

British Explorer [[Captain]] [[George Vancouver]] reached [[Howe Sound]] in June 1792 and became the first European to see the mountain. During this time George Vancouver met and traded with the local natives in the area.<ref>[http://www.bctravel.com/squamish/ Squamish BC Canada - Squamish and the Howe Sound Hotels, Resorts, Condos, Family Accommodations] Retrieved on [[2008-04-26]]</ref>

In 1860, while carrying out a survey of Howe Sound on board the [[Royal Navy]] survey ship ''[[HMS Plumper]]'', Captain [[George Henry Richards]] was impressed by a gigantic mountain<!--did he use that term?--> dominating the view to the northeast. Captain Richards, and his officers, re-named the mountain after the Italian military and political leader [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], who that year had succeeded in unifying [[Italy]] by patriating [[Sicily]] and [[Naples]].<ref name="DF">[http://www.garibaldipark.com Garibaldi Park BC - Whistler, Vancouver, Squamish - GaribaldiPark.com] Retrieved on [[2008-04-27]]</ref> In Augest 1907, the [[Vancouver]] mountaineers A. Dalton, W. Dalton, A. King, T. Pattison, J.J. Trorey, and G. Warren reached the summit of Mount Garibaldi.<ref name="AS"/> The mountain was probably the first of the truly alpine peaks in the [[Coast Mountains]] to be climbed by non-[[Indigenous peoples of North America|indigenous]] persons.<ref name="AS"/> The views from the peak inspired the establishment of summer climbing camps at [[Garibaldi Lake]]. This early interest led to the creation in 1920 of a park reserve.<ref name="DF"/>

In 1927, Garibaldi was made into a large wilderness park called [[Garibaldi Provincial Park]]. Named after Mount Garibaldi, this 194,650 hectare park was established to protect the rich geological history, diverse vegetation, iridescent waters, abundant wildlife, and rugged mountains, many of which are capped by glaciers.<ref>[http://www.britishcolumbia.com/parks/?id=49 BC Parks - Garibaldi Provincial Park, Sea to Sky Hwy, Whistler, British Columbia] Retrieved on [[2008-04-27]]</ref>

==Subsidiary peaks==
[[Image:MtGaribaldi-NorthFace-TheTable.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The north face of Mount Garibaldi rises above [[The Table]] and [[Garibaldi Lake]] ]]

The broad top of Mount Garibaldi contains three named peaks, the highest of which is the {{Unit m|2678|0}} main summit named Mount Garibaldi. The second highest peak is the rounded [[Dalton Dome]], {{Unit m|2633|0}}, west of the main summit. The lowest of the three is the sharp pyramid of [[Atwell Peak]], {{Unit m|2620|0}}, at the southern edge of the summit plateau. This peak is commonly called "Mount Garibaldi" when viewed from [[Squamish]], since the main peak is hidden behind it.<ref>[http://www.bivouac.com/MtnPg.asp?MtnId=5018 Atwell Peak] in the Canadian Mountain Encyclopedia. Retrieved on [[2008-04-27]]</ref> 

A feature on the north side of the mountain is known as The Tent, {{Unit m|2465|0}}, which is often climbed as part of Garibaldi N<U+00E9>v<U+00E9> traverse. Another minor summit on the south side of the mountain is known as Diamond Head, {{Unit m|2056|0}}, (sometimes Little Diamond Head) for its pyramid shape. Diamond Head was the site of a ski proposal and small lodge, now derelict. A feature on the west side of Mount Garibaldi is known as Brohm Ridge. Popular with snowmobilers and Garibaldi summiteers. Another minor summit on the northeast side of the mountain is known as The Sharkfin, a sharp rock fin sticking up out of the Warren Glacier just south of the Warren-Pitt River pass in Garibaldi Provincial Park.

==Glaciers and icefields==

Two pocket glaciers lie right below the east side of [[Atwell Peak]], the Diamond Glacier to the southeast and the upper Bishop Glacier to the northeast. Straight north of Atwell toward Mount Garibaldi lies a small, high-elevation ice cap called the Cheekeye Glacier.<ref>[http://www.bivouac.com/PhotoPg.asp?PhotoId=434 Atwell Peak - North Ridge] Retrieved on [[2008-04-27]]</ref>

An [[icefield]] lies on the eastern flanks of Mount Garibaldi called the [[Garibaldi N<U+00E9>v<U+00E9>]], which is a popular objective with the ski touring crowd.<ref name="QW">[http://www.bivouac.com/ArxPg.asp?ArxId=1318 Garibaldi Neve] in the Canadian Mountain Encyclopedia.

==Climbing and recreation==
[[Image:Mount Garibaldi3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mount Garibaldi and The Table as seen from Black Tusk]]

[[Mountain climbing]] on Mount Garibaldi is fairly difficult; it is fairly steep-sided and involves climbing very loose and rotten [[lava]] and [[volcanic ash]]. Fortunately, Mount Garibaldi has large areas of massive glaciation. The eastern and northern flanks of the mountain are smothered by the [[Garibaldi N<U+00E9>v<U+00E9>]], making the easiest route a [[glacial]] travel or snow climb.<ref>[http://alavigne.net/Outdoors/ImageGallery/2006/07-17-19-Garibaldi/ Mount Garibaldi - July 2006 - Andrew'w Website] Retrieved on [[2008-04-28]]</ref> Routes keep mostly to the [[glacier]]s and snow slopes, which are abundant in winter and spring, but eventually melt in late spring and commonly vanish after June or July of most years.<ref name="QQ">[http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.asp?trailid=XFA054-001 Mount Garibaldi | British Columbia Climbs] Retrieved on [[2008-04-28]]</ref> After the snow and ice melts, fissures and fractures can pose difficulty and danger, and rockfall is always a hazard. For this reason, early season, cold-weather ascents are recommended for most routes up Garibaldi.<ref name="QQ"/>

[[Hiking]], [[photography]], and [[camping]] are popular in the Garibaldi area. Hiking trails, including the [[Garibaldi Lake Trail]], a {{Unit km|6|0}} circumnavigation of the peak provide access to the backcountry. Mount Garibaldi is also popular for winter sports, including cross-country skiing. In summer, visitors pass through meadows of wildflowers, on trails emanating from Garibaldi Provincial Park.

==Geology==
[[Image:Atwell Peak 2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Atwell Peak]] ]]
Mount Garibaldi lies within the [[Coast Plutonic Complex]], which is the single largest contiguous [[granite]] outcropping in the world.<ref name="ZZ">[http://www.bivouac.com/ArxPg.asp?ArxId=1357 Coast Mountains] in the Canadian Mountain Encyclopedia. Retrieved on [[2008-04-26]]</ref> The [[intrusion|intrusive]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s extend approximately {{Unit km|1800|0}} along the coast of British Columbia, the [[Alaska Panhandle]] and southwestern [[Yukon]]. This is a remnant of a once vast [[volcanic arc]] called the ''Coast Range Arc'' that formed as a result of [[subduction]] of the [[Farallon Plate|Farallon]] and [[Kula Plate]]s during the [[Jurassic]]-to-[[Eocene]] periods.<ref>[http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/geo_history_wa/Coast%20Range%20Episode.htm The Coast Range Episode (115 to 57 million years ago)] Retrieved on [[2008-04-09]]</ref> In addition, Garibaldi, [[Mount Meager|Meager]], [[Mount Cayley|Cayley]] and [[Silverthrone Caldera|Silverthrone]] areas are of recent volcanic origin and are associated with the present-day [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade Volcanic Arc]].<ref name="ZZ"/>

Mount Garibaldi is a volcano in the [[Garibaldi Volcanic Belt]] of volcanic centers in southern British Columbia, and is one of the few Cascade volcanoes that is made exclusively of [[dacite]] ([[Glacier Peak]] is the other).<ref name="88Harris284">88Harris 1988, 284</ref> The [[mountain]] has a unique asymmetrical shape because its main cone was constructed atop part of a large [[glacier]] system that has since melted away.<ref name="88Harris283">Harris 1988, 283</ref> Unlike many of the other Cascade volcanoes to the south, Garibaldi does not dominate the surrounding landscape, which consists of many high, rugged peaks. Many residents of Vancouver are therefore not aware that there is a volcano closer to the city than the more easily visible [[Mount Baker]] in Washington State.

[[Image:Garibaldi Volcanic Belt-en.svg|thumb|right|350px|Map of the [[Garibaldi Volcanic Belt]] centers, including the Mount Garibaldi area.]]
The mountain grew in three phases. Garibaldi's first phase resulted in the creation of a broad composite cone made of dacite and [[breccia]] that has been [[potassium-argon dating|potassium-argon dated]] to 250,000 years old.<ref name="88Harris284"/> Parts of this ancestral volcano are exposed on Garibaldi's lower northern and eastern flanks and on the upper {{Unit m|240|0}} of Brohm Ridge. Around where Columnar Peak and possibly Glacier Pikes are now located, a series of coalescing dacite [[lava dome]]s were constructed.  During the ensuing long period of dormancy, the [[Cheekye River]] cut a deep valley into the cone's western flank that was later filled with a glacier.<ref name="88Harris284"/>

After reaching its maximum extent the Cheekye glacier along with part of the area's [[ice sheet]] were covered with [[volcanic ash]] and fragmented debris from Garibaldi. This period of growth began with the eruption of a dacite dome from a ridge surrounded by the  several thousand foot ice sheet. As the plug dome rose, massive sheets of broken lava crumbled as [[Scree|talus]] down its sides. Numerous  [[pyroclastic flow]]s (super-heated mix of [[gas]], ash, and [[pumice]]) accompanied these cooler avalanches, forming a fragmental cone 6.3&nbsp;cubic kilometres (1.5&nbsp;mi<U+00B3>) in volume and an overall slope of 12 to 15 degrees ([[erosion]] has since steepened this slope).<ref name="88Harris284"/> Some of the glacial ice was melted by the eruptions, forming a small [[lake]] against Brohm Ridge's southern arm. The volcanic [[sandstone]]s seen today atop Brohm Ridge were created by ash settling in this lake.<ref name="88Harris285">Harris 1988, 285</ref> 

Glacial overlap was most significant on the west and somewhat to the south.<ref name="88Harris285"/> Subsequent melting of the ice sheet and its component glaciers initiated a series of avalanches and [[mudflow]]s on Garibaldi's western flank that moved nearly half of the original cone's volume into the [[Squamish Valley]].<ref name="CD">[http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=1200-20- Global Volcanism Program (Garibaldi)] Retrieved on [[2008-04-27]]</ref> These series of [[debris flow]]s carried 2.5&nbsp;[[cubic kilometre|cubic kilometer]]s (0.6&nbsp;[[Cubic mile|mi<U+00B3>]]) of the mountain into the Squamish Valley where it covers 26&nbsp;[[square kilometre|square kilometer]]s (10&nbsp;[[Square mile|mi<U+00B2>]]) to a thickness of about {{Unit m|90|0}}.<ref>Given as 10&nbsp;mi<U+00B2> and 300&nbsp;feet in Harris 1988, 286</ref> Gaps left by melting ice caused minor to moderate cone distortion where the ice sheet was thin and major distortion where it was thick (the ice was thickest in and thus cone distortion was greatest over the buried Cheekye valley).  

Soon before or after the buried ice had melted away, dacite lava quietly erupted from [[Opal Cone]] north of the [[Atwell Peak]] plug dome and flowed down Garibaldi's north and northwestern flanks.<ref name="88Harris286">Harris 1988, 286</ref> One of the lava flows traveled down a 30 to 35% grade over the landslide scar on the western flank.<ref name="88Harris286"/> About 0.6&nbsp;cubic kilometers (0.15&nbsp;mi<U+00B3>) of dacite erupted in Garibaldi's third period of activity.<ref>Given as 0.15&nbsp;mi<U+00B3> in Harris 1988, 286</ref> This lava forms a thin layer of solid rock on the north and western sides of the volcano.

About 3.3&nbsp;cubic kilometers (0.8&nbsp;mi<U+00B3>) of material remains in the volcano.<ref>Given as 0.8&nbsp;mi<U+00B3> in Harris 1988, 286</ref> In modern times, the apron of material from the volcano's main vent extends at least {{Unit km|4.8|0}} from its source in places that were covered by ice and in other  areas its extent is less and its slope is steeper. 

==Volcanic hazards==
Mount Garibaldi is one of the top 11 Canadian volcanoes associated with recent [[Seismology|seismic activity]], the others include: [[Castle Rock (volcano)|Castle Rock]], [[Mount Edziza]], [[Mount Cayley]], [[Hoodoo Mountain]], [[Lava Fork]], [[Crow Lagoon]], [[Mount Silverthrone]], [[Mount Meager]], [[Wells Gray-Clearwater Volcanic Field]]<ref>[http://www.bcminerals.ca/pdf/CanadianVolcanoes-CH2005.pdf Volcanoes of Canada] Retrieved on [[2007-01-10]]</ref> and [[Nazko Cone]].<ref>[http://earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/nazko/nazko_chronology_e.php Chronology of Events in 2007 at Nazko Cone] Retrieved on [[2008-04-27]]</ref> The mountain is informally described as "dormant" ("asleep") or "extinct" ("dead") by the general public, because the mountain has not erupted in historic times, nor does it display [[fumarole|fumarolic]] activity like nearby [[Mount Baker]].<ref>[http://www.freewebs.com/tarachirico/explanation.htm Mount Garibaldi By: Tara Chirico] Retrieved on [[2008-04-28]]</ref> However, seismic data suggests that these volcanoes still contain living [[magma]] plumbing systems, indicating future eruptive activity. Although the existing data do not allow a clear conclusion, these observations are further indications that some of Canada's volcanoes are potentially active, and that their associated hazards may be significant. It is noteworthy that the seismic activity correlates with some of Canada's most youthful volcanoes, and with long-lived volcanic centers with a history of significant explosive behavior, such as Mount Garibaldi.  No [[hot spring]]s are known in the Garibaldi area like those found at [[Mount Meager]] and [[Mount Cayley]], the other major volcanic complexes in the Garibaldi belt, although there are hints of local anomalously high heat flow in [[Table Meadows]] and elsewhere.<ref>[http://www.empr.gov.bc.ca/DL/ARISReports/27299.pdf Geology and Geothermal Potential of the AWA Claim Group, Squamish, British Columbia] Retrieved on [[2008-04-27]]</ref>

Future volcanic activity from Mount Garibaldi would pose a severe threat to the nearby communities of [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]] and [[Squamish]]. Although there are no [[Plinian eruption]]s known, even [[Pelean eruption]]s could create large amounts of ash that could significantly affect these local communities.<ref name="AW"/> Ash columns may rise to several hundred meters above the volcano whose close proximity to [[Vancouver]] would make this a threat for air traffic. The hazard from lava flows would be low to moderate because the nature of the lavas would prevent them from travelling far from their source, even though the [[Ring Creek]] lava flow ends only {{Unit km|6|0}} from Squamish.<ref name="AW"/> Melting of leftover glacial ice covering the Mount Garibaldi area may cause [[flood]]s, [[lahar]]s, or [[debris flow]]s that could possibly threaten small communities such as [[Brackendale, British Columbia|Brackendale]].<ref name="AW"/> [[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] is already plagued by [[landslide]]s and debris flows from the steep rugged Coast Mountains.<ref name="AW">

An unusual volcanic structure called [[The Table]] is located {{Unit km|5|0}} north of Garibaldi.<ref name="XD">[http://www.bivouac.com/MtnPg.asp?MtnId=32 The Table] in the Canadian Mountain Encyclopedia. Retrieved on [[2008-04-27]]</ref> This several hundred foot high flat-topped volcano is made of layers of [[andesite|andesitic]] dacite that are arranged like a stack of more or less equal sized [[pancake]]s. The Table was formed in the early [[Holocene]] at a time when the Cordilleran [[ice sheet]] covered the region.<ref name="AH"/> As the volcano's lava rose it melted the part of the ice sheet above The Table's vent, creating space for the lava to move into. Repeated eruptions constructed the steep-walled stack of lava seen today.<ref name="XD"/>

It is considered to be the remnant of an [[extinct volcano|extinct]] [[andesite|andesitic]] [[stratovolcano]] which formed between about 1.3 and 1.1 million years ago.<ref name="AH"/>

[[Mount Price]], west of Garibaldi Lake, 5 km south of Black Tusk, was formed in three stages of activity, dating back 1.1 million years, the latest of which produced two large [[lava|lava flow]]s from [[Clinker Peak]] during the early Holocene that ponded against the retreating continental [[ice sheet]] and formed [[The Barrier]], containing Garibaldi Lake.<ref name="AH">[http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=1200-19- Global Volcanism Program: Garibaldi Lake] Retrieved on [[2008-04-27]]</ref>
