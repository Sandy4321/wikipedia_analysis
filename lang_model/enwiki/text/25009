The horse has [[evolution of the horse|evolved]] over the past 45 to 55&nbsp;million years from a small multi-toed creature into the large, [[odd-toed ungulate|single-toed]] animal of today. Humans began to [[Domestication|domesticate]] horses around 4000&nbsp;BCE, and their [[domestication of the horse|domestication]] is believed to have been widespread by 3000&nbsp;BCE. Although most horses today are domesticated, there are still endangered populations of the [[Przewalski's Horse]], the only remaining true [[wild horse]], as well as more common populations of [[feral horse]]s which live in the wild but are descended from domesticated ancestors. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from [[anatomy]] to life stages, size, [[equine coat color|colors]], [[horse markings|markings]], [[List of horse breeds|breeds]], [[animal locomotion|locomotion]], and behavior.

Horses' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed [[Equilibrioception|sense of balance]] and a strong [[Fight-or-flight response|fight-or-flight]] instinct. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down. Female horses, called [[mare]]s, carry their young for approximately 11&nbsp;months, and a young horse, called a [[foal]], can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under [[saddle]] or in [[Horse harness|harness]] between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30&nbsp;years.

Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods", such as [[draft horse]]s and some [[Pony|ponies]], suitable for slow, heavy work; and "[[warmblood]]s", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are over 300&nbsp;breeds of horses in the world today, developed for many different uses.

Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits, as well as in working activities such as [[Mounted police|police work]], [[working animal|agriculture]], entertainment, and therapy. Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of [[equestrianism|riding]] and [[driving (horse)|driving]] techniques developed, using many different styles of [[Horse tack|equipment]] and methods of control. Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water and shelter, as well as attention from specialists such as [[veterinarian]]s and [[farrier]]s.

==Biology==
{{Main|Equine anatomy}}
[[Image:Dessin_cheval_grand.jpg|right|thumb|Parts of a horse|upright=1.5|alt=Diagram of a horse with some parts labeled.]]

[[Horse anatomy]] is described by a large number of specific terms, as illustrated by the chart to the right. Specific terms also describe various ages, colors and [[list of horse breeds|breeds]].

===Age===
Depending on breed, management and environment, the domestic horse today has a life expectancy of 25 to 30&nbsp;years.<ref name=Ensminger46/> It is uncommon, but a few animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/horses/facts/info_age.htm|title=The Age of a Horse|publisher=Government of Ontario|work=Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs|author=Wright, B.|date=March 29, 1999|accessdate=2009-10-21}}</ref> The oldest verifiable record was "[[Old Billy]]", a 19th-century horse that lived to the age of 62.<ref name=Ensminger46/><ref name="horsefacts">{{cite web |url= http://www.fbresearch.org/HorseFacts/Facts/|title= The Mane Facts About Horse Health|accessdate=2007-01-22 |work= Horsefacts.org |publisher= Foundation for Biomedical Research}}</ref> In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had been listed in the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]] as the world's oldest living pony, died in 2007, aged 56.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thehorse.com/viewarticle.aspx?ID=9708|title= World's Oldest Living Pony Dies at 56|accessdate=2007-05-31 |author= Ryder, Erin |work= TheHorse.com |publisher= The Horse}}</ref>

Regardless of a horse's actual birth date, for most competition purposes an animal is considered a year older on January&nbsp;1 of each year in the northern hemisphere<ref name=Ensminger46/><ref>British Horse Society ''The Manual of Horsemanship of the British Horse Society'' p. 255</ref> and August&nbsp;1 in the southern hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.studbook.org.au/DisplayPDF.aspx?ty=RULES |format=PDF |title= Rules of the Australian Stud Book |accessdate=2008-07-09 |year= 2007 |publisher=Australian Jockey Club |page=7}}</ref> The exception is in [[endurance riding]], where the minimum age to compete is based on the animal's calendar age.<ref name=Endurance>{{cite web |url= http://www.aerc.org/horseage.asp|title= Age Matters (Your Horse's Age, That Is!)|accessdate=2008-04-05|work= |publisher= American Endurance Riding Conference}}</ref> A very rough estimate of a horse's age can be made from looking at its [[Horse teeth|teeth]].<ref name=Ensminger46/>

The following terminology is used to describe horses of various ages:
* [[Foal]]: a horse of either sex less than one year old. A nursing foal is sometimes called a ''suckling'' and a foal that has been weaned is called a ''weanling.''<ref name=Ensminger418>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 418</ref> Most domesticated foals are weaned at 5 to 7&nbsp;months of age, although foals can be weaned at 4 months with no adverse effects.<ref>Giffen, et al., ''Horse Owner's Veterinary Handbook'', p. 431</ref>
* [[Yearling (horse)|Yearling]]: a horse of either sex that is between one and two years old.<ref>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 430</ref>
* [[Colt (horse)|Colt]]: a male horse under the age of four.<ref>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 415</ref> A common terminology error is to call any young horse a "colt", when the term actually only refers to young male horses.<ref>Becker, et al., ''Why Do Horses Sleep Standing Up?'', p. 23</ref>
* [[Filly]]: a female horse under the age of four.<ref name=Ensminger418/>
* [[Mare]]: a female horse four years old and older.<ref>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 422</ref>
* [[Stallion]]: a non-castrated male horse four years old and older.<ref>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 427</ref> Some people, particularly in the UK, refer to a stallion as a "horse".<ref name=Ensminger420>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 420</ref>
* [[Gelding]]: a [[castration|castrated]] male horse of any age.<ref name=Ensminger418/>

In [[horse racing]], these definitions may differ: For example, in the British Isles, [[Thoroughbred]] horse racing defines colts and fillies as less than five years old.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.equibase.com/newfan/glossary-full.cfm|title= Glossary of Horse Racing Terms|accessdate=2008-04-03 |work= Equibase.com|publisher= Equibase Company, LLC}}</ref> However, for Australian Thoroughbred racing, colts and fillies are<!--and American--> less than four years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studbook.org.au/DisplayPDF.aspx?ty=RULES|title=Rules of the Australian Stud Book|accessdate=2010-02-05|page=9|date=July 2008|publisher=Australian Jockey Club Ltd and Victoria Racing Club Ltd}}</ref><!--the harness racing bit somehow was scrambled, so tossed as not really needed-->

===Size and measurement===
{{See also|Hand (length)}}
The height of horses is measured at the highest point of the [[withers]], where the neck meets the [[back (horse)|back]]. This point was chosen as it is a stable point of the anatomy, unlike the head or neck, which move up and down.

The English-speaking world measures the height of horses in [[Hand (length)|hands]] (abbreviated "h" or "hh", for "hands high") and [[inch]]es. One hand is equal to {{convert|101.6|mm|in|0}}. The height is expressed as the number of full hands, followed by a decimal point, then the number of additional inches. Thus, a horse described as "15.2 h" is 15&nbsp;hands ({{convert|60|in|cm|1}}) plus {{convert|2|in|cm|1}}, for a total of {{convert|62|in|cm|1}} in height.<ref name=Ensminger51>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 51</ref>

[[Image:Horse-and-pony.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Size varies greatly among horse breeds, as with this full-sized horse and a miniature horse.|alt=A large brown horse is chasing a small horse in a pasture.]]

The size of horses varies by [[list of horse breeds|breed]], but also is influenced by [[equine nutrition|nutrition]]. Light riding horses usually range in height from {{hands|14|to|16}} and can weigh from {{convert|380|to|550|kg}}.<ref>Bongianni ''Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses & Ponies of the World'' entry 1,68,69</ref> Larger riding horses usually start at about {{hands|15.2}} and often are as tall as {{hands|17}}, weighing from {{convert|500|to|600|kg}}.<ref>Bongianni ''Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses & Ponies of the World'' entry 12,30,31,32,75</ref> Heavy or [[draft horse]]s are usually at least {{hands|16|to|18}} high and can weigh from about {{convert|700|to|1000|kg}}.<ref>Bongianni ''Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses & Ponies of the World'' entry 86, 96, 97</ref><!--tossed the breed examples here, just leaving, "light" "draft" etc., which we explain later anyway, this was also a magnet for laundry-listing -->

The largest horse in recorded history was probably a [[Shire horse]] named [[Sampson (horse)|Mammoth]], who was born in 1848. He stood 21.2<U+00BD> hands high ({{convert|86.5|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=/}}), and his peak weight was estimated at {{convert|1500|kg}}.<ref name=Whitaker60>Whitaker ''The Horse'' p. 60</ref> The current record holder for the world's smallest horse is [[Thumbelina (horse)|Thumbelina]], a fully mature [[miniature horse]] affected by [[dwarfism]]. She is {{convert|17|in|cm}} tall and weighs {{convert|27|lb|kg}}.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=409317&in_page_id=1770|title=Meet Thumbelina, the World's Smallest Horse |accessdate=2006-10-08 |author= Martin, Arthur |work= Daily Mail}}</ref>

====Ponies====
{{Main|Pony}}
The general rule for height between a horse and a [[pony]] at maturity is {{hands|14.2}}. An animal 14.2&nbsp;h or over is usually considered to be a horse and one less than 14.2&nbsp;h a pony.<ref name=EnsmingerHT11>Ensminger ''Horses and Tack'' pp. 11<U+2013>12</ref> However, there are many exceptions to the general rule. In Australia, ponies measure under {{hands|14}}.<ref>Howlett, ''Ponies in Australia'', p. 14</ref> The [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports]], which uses [[metric system|metric]] measurements, defines the cutoff between horses and ponies at {{convert|148|cm|in|2}} (just over 14.2 h) without shoes and {{convert|149|cm|in|2}} (just over 14.2-1/2 h) with shoes.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fei.org/sites/default/files/Annex%20XVII%20-%20Extracts%20Ponies.pdf | title=Annex XVII: Extracts from Rules for Pony Riders and Children, 9th edition |publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Equestre Internationale | date =2009| accessdate= 2010-03-07}}</ref> Some breeds which typically produce individuals both under and over 14.2&nbsp;h considered all animals of that breed to be horses regardless of their height.<ref>For example, the [[Missouri Fox Trotter]] or the [[Arabian horse]]. See McBane ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Horse Breeds'' pp. 192, 218</ref> Conversely, some pony breeds may have features in common with horses, and individual animals may occasionally mature at over 14.2&nbsp;h, but are still considered to be ponies.<ref>For example, the [[Welsh Pony]]. ''See'' McBane ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Horse Breeds'' pp. 52<U+2013>63</ref>

The distinction between a horse and pony is not simply a difference in height, but other aspects of ''[[phenotype]]'' or appearance, such as [[Equine conformation|conformation]] and temperament. Ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails, and overall coat. They also have proportionally shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, shorter and thicker necks, and short heads with broad foreheads. They may have calmer temperaments than horses and also a high level of equine intelligence that may or may not be used to cooperate with human handlers.<ref name=EnsmingerHT11/> In fact, small size, by itself, is sometimes not a factor at all. While the [[Shetland pony]] stands on average {{hands|10}},<ref name=HorseTack12>Ensminger ''Horses and Tack'' p. 12</ref> the [[Falabella]] and other [[miniature horse]]s, which can be no taller than {{convert|30|in|cm}}, the size of a medium-sized dog, are classified by their respective [[breed registry|registries]] as very small horses rather than as ponies.<ref>McBane ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Horse Breeds'' p. 200</ref>

===Colors and markings===
{{Main|Equine coat color|Equine coat color genetics|Horse markings}}
[[File:Horsescd1l-095.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|[[Bay (horse)|Bay]] (left) and [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] (sometimes called "sorrel") are two of the most common coat colors, seen in almost all breeds.|alt=Two horses in a field. The one on the left is a dark brown with black mane and tail. The one on the right is a light red all over.]]

Horses exhibit a diverse array of [[Equine coat color|coat colors]] and distinctive [[horse markings|markings]], described with a specialized vocabulary. Often, a horse is classified first by its coat color, before breed or sex.<ref>Vogel, ''The Complete Horse Care Manual'', p. 14</ref>  Horses of the same color may be distinguished from one another by white [[horse markings|markings]],<ref>Mills, et al., ''A Basic Guide to Horse Care and Management'', pp. 72<U+2013>73</ref> which, along with various spotting patterns, are inherited separately from coat color.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=4354|title=A Horse of a Different Color|journal=The Horse|format=Registration required|accessdate=2010-02-11|author=Corum, Stephanie J.|date=May 1, 2003}}</ref>

Many [[Equine coat color genetics|genes]] that create horse coat colors have been identified, although research continues to further identify factors that result in specific traits. One of the first genetic relationships to be understood was that between recessive  "red" ([[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]]) and dominant "black", which is controlled by the "red factor" or [[Melanocortin 1 receptor|extension gene]]. Additional [[allele]]s control spotting, graying, suppression or [[dilution gene|dilution]] of color, and other effects that create the dozens of possible coat colors found in horses.<ref name=UCVGL>{{cite web |url= http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/coatcolorhorse.php|title= Horse Coat Color Tests|accessdate=2008-05-01 |work= Veterinary Genetics Laboratory |publisher= University of California}}</ref>

[[Chestnut (coat)|Chestnut]], [[bay (horse)|bay, brown]], and [[Black (horse)|black]] are the basic equine coat colors. These colors are modified by at least ten other genes to create all other colors, including dilutions such as [[palomino]] and spotting patterns such as [[pinto horse|pinto]].<ref name=UCVGL/>  Horses which are white in coat color are often mislabeled as "white" horses. However, a horse that looks white is usually a middle-aged or older [[gray (horse)|gray]]. Grays are born a darker shade, get lighter as they age, and usually have black skin underneath their white hair coat (with the exception of pink skin under white [[horse markings|markings]]). The only horses properly called [[white (horse)|white]] are born with a white hair coat and have predominantly pink skin, a fairly rare occurrence.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/coatcolor.php|title= Introduction to Coat Color Genetics|accessdate=2008-05-01|work= Veterinary Genetics Laboratory |publisher= University of California}}</ref> There are no truly "[[Albinism|albino]]" horses having both pink skin and red eyes.<ref name=Duplicatetest>{{cite journal |url= http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1439-0388.2004.00481.x?journalCode=jbg |title= Genetic mapping of dominant white (W), a homozygous lethal condition in the horse (Equus caballus) (2004)|accessdate=9 January 2009 |author= Mau, C., Poncet, P.

===Reproduction and development===
{{Main|Horse breeding}}
[[Gestation]] lasts for approximately 335<U+2013>340&nbsp;days<ref name=HorseTack129>Ensminger ''Horses and Tack'' p. 129</ref> and usually results in one [[foal]]. Twins are rare.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www2.okstate.edu/pio/twinfoals.html|accessdate=2008-09-23|title=Rare Twin Foals Born at Vet Hospital: Twin Birth Occurrences Number One in Ten Thousand| author=Johnson, Tom|work= Communications Services, Oklahoma State University|publisher= Oklahoma State University}}</ref> Horses are a [[precocial]] species, and foals are capable of standing and running within a short time following birth.<ref>Miller, ''Revolution,'' pp. 102<U+2013>103</ref>

Horses, particularly colts, sometimes are physically capable of reproduction at about 18&nbsp;months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed before the age of three, especially females.<ref name=HorseTack129/> Horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, and quality of care. Also, if the horse is larger, its bones are larger; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to actually form [[Osseous tissue|bone tissue]], but the [[epiphyseal plate]]s are also larger and take longer to convert from [[cartilage]] to bone. These plates convert after the other parts of the bones, and are crucial to development.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.equineortho.colostate.edu/questions/dod.htm |title=Developmental Orthopaedic Disease: Problems of Limbs in young Horses|accessdate=2008-04-20|author= McIlwraith, C.W.|publisher=Colorado State University|work=Orthopaedic Research Center}}</ref>

Depending on maturity, breed, and work expected, horses are usually put under saddle and [[horse training|trained]] to be ridden between the ages of two and four.<ref name=Train163>Thomas ''Storey's Guide to Training Horses'' p. 163</ref> Although [[Thoroughbred]] [[Horse racing|race horses]] are put on the track at as young as two years old in some countries,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jockeyclub.com/factbook.asp?section=11|title= 2-Year-Old Racing (US and Canada)|accessdate=2008-04-28 |work= Online Fact Book|publisher= Jockey Club}}</ref> horses specifically bred for sports such as [[dressage]] are generally not put under saddle until they are three or four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed.<ref>Bryant, ''The USDF Guide to Dressage'', pp. 271-272</ref> For [[endurance riding]] competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60&nbsp;calendar months (5 years) old.<ref name=Endurance/>

===Anatomy===

{{See also|Muscular system of the horse|Respiratory system of the horse|Circulatory system of the horse}}
====Skeletal system====
{{Main|Skeletal system of the horse}}
[[Image:Horseanatomy.png|thumb|upright=1.4|The skeletal system of a modern horse|alt=Diagram of a horse skeleton with major parts labeled.]]

Horses have a skeleton that averages 205 bones.<ref name=Evans90>Evans ''The Horse'' p. 90</ref> A significant difference between the horse skeleton and that of a human, is the lack of a [[Clavicle|collarbone]]<U+2014>the horse's [[Equine forelimb anatomy|forelimbs]] are attached to the [[Vertebral column|spinal column]] by a powerful set of muscles, tendons, and ligaments that attach the [[Scapula|shoulder blade]] to the torso. The horse's legs and hooves are also unique structures. Their leg bones are proportioned differently from those of a human. For example, the body part that is called a horse's "knee" is actually made up of the [[Carpus|carpal]] bones that correspond to the human [[wrist]]. Similarly, the [[hock (zoology)|hock]] contains bones equivalent to those in the human [[ankle]] and [[heel]]. The lower leg bones of a horse correspond to the bones of the human hand or foot, and the [[Equine anatomy|fetlock]] (incorrectly called the "ankle") is actually the proximal [[sesamoid bone]]s between the [[Equine anatomy|cannon]] bones (a single equivalent to the human [[Metacarpus|metacarpal]] or [[Metatarsus|metatarsal]] bones) and the [[proximal phalanges]], located where one finds the "knuckles" of a human. A horse also has no muscles in its legs below the knees and hocks, only skin, hair, bone, [[tendon]]s, [[ligament]]s, [[cartilage]], and the assorted specialized tissues that make up the [[horse hoof|hoof]].<ref name=Ensminger21>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' pp. 21<U+2013>25</ref>

====Hooves====
{{Main|Horse hoof}}
{{See also|Horseshoe|Farrier}}
The critical importance of the feet and legs is summed up by the traditional adage, "no foot, no horse".<ref name=Ensminger367>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 367</ref> The [[horse hoof]] begins with the [[distal phalanges]], the equivalent of the human fingertip or tip of the toe, surrounded by [[cartilage]] and other specialized, blood-rich soft tissues such as the [[Horse hoof#Internal structures|laminae]]. The exterior hoof wall and horn of the sole is made of essentially the same material as a human [[Nail (anatomy)|fingernail]].<ref>Giffin ''Horse Owner's Veterinary Handbook'' p. 304</ref> The end result is that a horse, weighing on average {{convert|500|kg}},<ref>Giffin ''Horse Owner's Veterinary Handbook'' p. 457</ref> travels on the same bones as would a human on tiptoe.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cvm.uiuc.edu/petcolumns/showarticle_pf.cfm?id=118|title= Yes, The Shin Bone Is Connected to the Ankle Bone|accessdate=2008-04-05 |author= Fuess, Ph.D., Theresa A.|work= Pet Column|publisher= University of Illinois}}</ref> For the protection of the hoof under certain conditions, some horses have [[horseshoe]]s placed on their feet by a professional [[farrier]]. The hoof continually grows, and needs to be trimmed (and horseshoes reset, if used) every five to eight weeks.<ref>Giffin ''Horse Owner's Veterinary Handbook'' pp. 310<U+2013>312</ref>

====Teeth====
{{Main|Horse teeth}}
Horses are adapted to grazing. In an adult horse, there are 12&nbsp;[[incisor]]s, adapted to biting off the grass or other vegetation, at the front of the mouth. There are 24&nbsp;teeth adapted for chewing, the [[premolar]]s and [[Molar (tooth)|molars]], at the back of the mouth. Stallions and geldings have four additional teeth just behind the incisors, a type of [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]] that are called "tushes". Some horses, both male and female, will also develop one to four very small [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] teeth in front of the molars, known as "wolf" teeth, which are generally removed because they can interfere with the [[bit (horse)|bit]]. There is an empty interdental space between the incisors and the molars where the bit rests directly on the bars (gums) of the horse's mouth when the horse is [[bridle]]d.<ref>Kreling ''Horses' Teeth and Their Problems'' pp. 12<U+2013>13</ref>

The incisors show a distinct wear and growth pattern as the horse ages, as well as change in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. The [[horse teeth|teeth]] continue to erupt throughout life as they are worn down by grazing, so a very rough estimate of a horse's age can be made by an examination of its teeth, although diet and veterinary care can affect the rate of tooth wear.<ref name=Ensminger46>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' pp. 46<U+2013>50</ref>

====Digestion====
{{Main|Equine anatomy#Digestive system|Equine nutrition}}
Horses are [[herbivore]]s with a digestive system adapted to a [[forage]] diet of grasses and other plant material, consumed steadily throughout the day. Therefore, compared to humans, they have a relatively small stomach but very long intestines to facilitate a steady flow of nutrients. A {{convert|450|kg|adj=on}} horse will eat {{convert|7|to|11|kg}} of food per day and, under normal use, drink {{convert|38|L}} to {{convert|45|L}} of [[water]]. Horses are not [[ruminant]]s, so they have only one stomach, like humans, but unlike humans, they can also digest [[cellulose]] from grasses due to the presence of a "hind gut" called the [[cecum]], or "water gut", which food goes through before reaching the [[large intestine]]. Unlike humans, horses cannot vomit, so digestion problems can quickly cause [[horse colic|colic]], a leading cause of death.<ref>Giffin ''Horse Owner's Veterinary Handbook'' p. 175</ref>

====Senses====
{{See also|Equine vision}}
[[File:Pferdeauge.jpg|thumb|A horse's eye|alt=Close up of a horse eye, with is dark brown with lashes on the top eyelid]]
The horse's senses are generally superior to those of a human. As [[predation|prey animals]], they must be aware of their surroundings at all times.<ref name=Ensminger309>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' pp. 309<U+2013>310</ref> They have the largest eyes of any land mammal,<ref name=Sellnow>Sellnow, ''Happy Trails'', p. 46</ref> and are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=15938  | title=Eye Position and Animal Agility Study Published|journal = The Horse | date =March 07, 2010 |note=Press Release, citing  February 2010 Journal of Anatomy, Dr. Nathan Jeffery, co-author, University of Liverpool|accessdate=2010-03-11}}</ref>  This means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350<U+00B0>, with approximately 65<U+00B0> of this being [[binocular vision]] and the remaining 285<U+00B0> [[monocular vision]].<ref name=Sellnow/> Horses have excellent day and [[night vision]], but they have two-color, or [[Dichromacy|dichromatic vision]]; their [[color vision]] is somewhat like [[Color blindness#Red-green color blindness|red-green color blindness]] in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear more green.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.thehorse.com/viewarticle.aspx?ID=9670|title= In Living Color |format=registration required|accessdate=2007-07-27 |author= McDonnell, Sue |work= The Horse |date= June 1, 2007|publisher= The Horse, Inc.}}</ref>

Their hearing is good,<ref name=Ensminger309/> and the [[Pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] of each ear can rotate up to 180<U+00B0>, giving the potential for 360<U+00B0> hearing without having to move the head.<ref>Myers ''Horse Safe'' p.7</ref> Their [[Olfaction|sense of smell]], while much better than that of humans, is not their strongest asset; they rely to a greater extent on vision.<ref name=Ensminger309/>

Horses have a great sense of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly developed [[Proprioception|proprioceptive]] abilities <!--do we need all these parenthetical explanations when they are wikilinked?--> (the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thoroughbredtimes.com/horse-health/1998/October/17/True-horse-sense.aspx|title= True Horse Sense|accessdate=2008-07-08 |author= Thomas, Heather Smith |work= Thoroughbred Times |publisher= Thoroughbred Times Company}}</ref> A horse's [[Somatosensory system|sense of touch]] is well developed.

Horses have an advanced sense of taste that allows them to sort through [[fodder]] to choose what they would most like to eat,<ref>Miller, ''Understanding the Ancient Secrets of the Horse's Mind'', p. 28</ref> and their [[Prehensility|prehensile]] lips can easily sort even the smallest grains. Horses generally will not eat poisonous plants. However, there are exceptions and horses will occasionally eat toxic amounts of poisonous plants even when there is adequate healthy food.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cvm.uiuc.edu/petcolumns/showarticle.cfm?id=16|title= Horse Pasture is No Place for Poisonous Plants|accessdate=2008-07-09 |author= Gustavson, Carrie |work= Pet Column July 24, 2000 |publisher= University of Illinois}}</ref>

===Movement===
{{Main|Horse gait|Trot (horse gait)|Canter|Ambling}}
[[File:Muybridge race horse animated.gif|thumb|left|The gallop|upright=1.4|alt=Film showing a horse running.]]
All horses move naturally with four basic [[horse gait|gaits]]: the four-beat [[Horse gait#Walk|walk]], which averages {{convert|6.4|km/h}}; the two-beat [[Trot (horse gait)|trot or jog]] at {{convert|13|to|19|km/h}} (faster for [[harness racing]] horses); the [[Canter|canter or lope]], a three-beat gait that is {{convert|19|to|24|km/h}}; and the [[Horse gait#Gallop|gallop]].<ref name=HorseGaits32>Harris ''Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement'' p. 32</ref> The gallop averages {{convert|40|to|48|km/h}},<ref name=Harris47>Harris, ''Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement'' p. 47<U+2013>49</ref> but the world record for a horse galloping over a short, [[Sprint (race)|sprint]] distance is {{convert|88|km/h}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racing.aqha.com/racing/dyn_content.aspx?FQD=http://www.aqha.com/aqharacing.com/gettingstarted/firsttimersguide/thehorse.html|title=About the Horse|work=First Timers Guide|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=American Quarter Horse Association}}</ref> Besides these basic gaits, some horses perform a two-beat [[Horse gait#Pace|pace]], instead of the trot.<ref name=HorseGaits50>Harris ''Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement'' p. 50</ref> There also are several four-beat "[[ambling]]" gaits that are approximately the speed of a trot or pace, though smoother to ride.

===Behavior===
{{Main|Horse behavior|Stable vices}}
Horses are prey animals with a strong [[Fight-or-flight response|fight-or-flight]] instinct. Their first response to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is not possible, or if their young are threatened. They also tend to be curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses..<ref name=Natural226>McBane ''A Natural Approach to Horse Management'' pp. 226<U+2013>228</ref> Horses are herd animals, with a clear hierarchy of rank, led by a dominant animal (usually a mare). They are also social creatures who are able to form companionship attachments to their own species and to other animals, including humans. They communicate in various ways, including vocalizations such as nickering or whinnying, mutual [[Social grooming|grooming]], and [[body language]]. Many horses will become difficult to manage if they are isolated, but with training, horses can learn to accept a human as a companion, and thus be comfortable away from other horses.<ref name=Ensminger305>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' pp. 305<U+2013>309</ref> However, when confined with insufficient companionship, exercise, or stimulation, individuals may develop [[stable vices]], an assortment of bad habits, mostly [[psychology|psychological]] in origin, that include wood chewing, wall kicking, "weaving" (rocking back and forth), and other problems.<ref name=Prince214>Prince ''Basic Horsemanship'' pp. 214<U+2013>223</ref>

====Intelligence and learning====
In the past, horses were considered unintelligent, with no [[concept|abstract thinking]] ability, unable to generalize, and driven primarily by a [[herd mentality]]. However, modern studies show that they perform a number of [[Cognition|cognitive]] tasks on a daily basis, with mental challenges that include [[foraging|food procurement]] and [[Social structure|social system]] identification. They also have good [[Spatial visualization ability|spatial discrimination]] abilities.<ref name=Hanggi>{{cite web|url=http://www.horsetalk.co.nz/features/horseintelligence-119.shtml|title=Understanding horse intelligence|author=Hanggi, Evelyn B.|date=2007-04-16|accessdate=2008-09-16|work=Horsetalk 2007|publisher=Horsetalk}}</ref> Studies have assessed equine intelligence in the realms of [[problem solving]], learning speed, and knowledge retention. Results show that horses excel at simple learning, but also are able to solve advanced cognitive challenges that involve [[categorization]] and [[concept learning]]. They learn from [[habituation]], [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]], [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovian conditioning]], and [[operant conditioning]]. They respond to and learn from both positive and negative [[reinforcement]].<ref name=Hanggi/> Recent studies even suggest horses are able to count if the quantity involved is less than four.<ref name="count">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=15396 | title=Horses Demonstrate Ability to Count in New Study |author=Lest<U+00E9>-Lasserre, Christa |accessdate=2009-12-06|work=The Horse, Online Edition|publisher=Blood-Horse Publications}}</ref>

Domesticated horses tend to face greater mental challenges than wild horses, because they live in artificial environments that stifle [[instinct]]ual behavior while learning tasks that are not natural.<ref name=Hanggi/> Horses are creatures of [[Habit (psychology)|habit]] that respond and adapt well to regimentation, and respond best when the same routines and techniques are used consistently. Some trainers believe that "intelligent" horses are reflections of intelligent trainers who effectively use response conditioning techniques and positive reinforcement to train in the style that fits best with an individual animal's natural inclinations. Others who handle horses regularly note that personality also may play a role separate from intelligence in determining how a given animal responds to various experiences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.bloodhorse.com/blogs/nicanor/archive/2008/06/17/equine-iq-what-big-brown-couldn-t-tell-you-and-mr-ed-kept-to-himself.aspx|title=What Big Brown Couldn't Tell You and Mr. Ed Kept to Himself (part 1)|author=Coarse, Jim|date=2008-06-17|accessdate=2008-09-16|work=The BloodHorse|publisher=Blood-Horse Publications}}</ref>

====Temperament====
{{Main|Draft horse|Warmblood|Oriental horse}}

Horses are [[mammal]]s, and as such are "[[warm-blooded]]" creatures, as opposed to [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] [[reptile]]s. However, these words have developed a separate meaning in the context of equine terminology, used to describe temperament, not [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]]. For example, the "hot-bloods", such as many [[horse racing|race horses]], exhibit more sensitivity and energy,<ref name=Belknap255>Belknap ''Horsewords'' p. 255</ref> while the "cold-bloods", such as most [[draft horse|draft breeds]], are quieter and calmer.<ref name=Belknap112>Belknap ''Horsewords'' p. 112</ref> Sometimes "hot-bloods" are classified as "light horses" or "riding horses",<ref name=Ensminger71>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' pp. 71<U+2013>73</ref> with the "cold-bloods" classified as "draft horses" or "work horses".<ref name=Ensminger84>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 84</ref>

[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary b35 043-0.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Illustration of hotbloods, warmbloods and coldblood breeds|alt=a sepia-toned engraving from an old book, showing 11 horses of different breeds and sizes in nine different illustrations]]
"Hot blooded" breeds include "[[oriental horse]]s" such as the [[Akhal-Teke]], [[Barb (horse)|Barb]], [[Arabian horse]] and now-extinct [[Turkoman horse]], as well as the [[Thoroughbred]], a breed developed in England from the older oriental breeds.<ref name=Belknap255/> Hot bloods tend to be spirited, bold, and learn quickly. They are bred for agility and speed.<ref name=Catalog18/> They tend to be physically refined<U+2014>thin-skinned, slim, and long-legged.<ref>DeFilippis ''The Everything Horse Care Book'' p. 4</ref> The original oriental breeds were brought to Europe from the Middle East and North Africa when European breeders wished to infuse these traits into racing and light [[cavalry]] horses.<ref name=Whitaker43>Whitaker ''The Horse'' p. 43</ref><ref name=Whitaker194>Whitaker ''The Horse'' pp. 194<U+2013>197</ref>

Muscular, heavy [[draft horse]]s are known as "cold bloods", as they are bred not only for strength, but also to have the calm, patient temperament needed to pull a plow or a heavy carriage full of people.<ref name=Belknap112/> They are sometimes nicknamed "gentle giants".<ref name=Catalog15>Price ''Whole Horse Catalog'' p. 15</ref> Well-known draft breeds include the [[Belgian (horse)|Belgian]] and the [[Clydesdale (horse)|Clydesdale]].<ref name=Catalog15/> Some, like the [[Percheron]] are lighter and livelier, developed to pull carriages or to plow large fields in drier climates.<ref name=Guide87>Bongianni ''Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses & Ponies of the World'' entry 87</ref> Others, such as the [[Shire horse|Shire]], are slower and more powerful, bred to plow fields with heavy, clay-based soils.<ref name=Ens124>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' pp. 124<U+2013>125</ref> The cold-blooded group also includes some pony breeds.<ref>Bennett, ''Conquerors,'' p. 7</ref>

"[[Warmblood]]" breeds, such as the [[Trakehner]] or [[Hanoverian (horse)|Hanoverian]], developed when European carriage and [[horses in warfare|war horses]] were crossed with Arabians or Thoroughbreds, producing a riding horse with more refinement than a draft horse, but greater size and milder temperament than a lighter breed.<ref>Edwards, ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', pp. 122<U+2013>123</ref> Certain [[pony]] breeds with warmblood characteristics have been developed for smaller riders.<ref>Examples are the [[Australian Riding Pony]] and the [[Connemara pony|Connemara]], see Edwards, ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', pp. 178<U+2013>179, 208<U+2013>209</ref> Warmbloods are considered a "light horse" or "riding horse".<ref name=Ensminger71/>

Today, the term "Warmblood" refers to a specific subset of [[sport horse]] breeds that are used for competition in [[dressage]] and [[show jumping]].<ref name=Lyons231>Price et al. ''Lyons Press Horseman's Dictionary'' p. 231</ref> Strictly speaking, the term "[[Warmblood|warm blood]]" refers to any [[crossbreeding|cross]] between cold-blooded and hot-blooded breeds.<ref name=Belknap523>Belknap ''Horsewords'' p. 523</ref> Examples include breeds such as the [[Irish Draught]] or the [[Cleveland Bay]]. The term was once used to refer to breeds of light riding horse other than Thoroughbreds or Arabians, such as the [[Morgan horse]].<ref name=Catalog18>Price, et al. ''Whole Horse Catalog'' p. 18</ref>

====Sleep patterns====
{{See also|Horse behavior#Sleep patterns|l1=Horse sleep patterns|Sleep (non-human)|l2=Sleep in non-humans}}
[[Image:Biandintz eta zaldiak - modified2.jpg|thumb|left|When horses lie down to sleep, others in the herd remain standing, awake or in a light doze, keeping watch.|alt=Two horses in a pasture, one is standing beside the other that is laying down.]]
Horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down. In an adaptation from life in the wild, horses are able to enter light sleep by using a "stay apparatus" in their legs, allowing them to doze without collapsing.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/eqzzz629/|title= How Horses Sleep |accessdate=2007-03-23 |author= Pascoe, Elaine |work= Equisearch.com |publisher= EquiSearch}}</ref> Horses sleep better when in groups because some animals will sleep while others stand guard to watch for predators. A horse kept alone will not sleep well because its [[instinct]]s are to keep a constant eye out for danger.<ref name="Horse sleep pt. 2"/>

Unlike humans, horses do not sleep in a solid, unbroken period of time, but take many short periods of rest. Horses spend four to fifteen hours a day in standing rest, and from a few minutes to several hours lying down. Total sleep time in a 24-hour period may range from several minutes to a couple of hours,<ref name="Horse sleep pt. 2">{{cite web |url= http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/eqpowernap1771/|title= How Horses Sleep, Pt. 2&nbsp;<U+2013> Power Naps|accessdate=2007-03-23 |author= Pascoe, Elaine|work= Equisearch.com |publisher= EquiSearch}}</ref> mostly in short intervals of about 15&nbsp;minutes each.<ref name=Ensminger310>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 310.</ref>

Horses must lie down to reach [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]]. They only have to lie down for an hour or two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements.<ref name="Horse sleep pt. 2"/> However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may suddenly collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/sleepdisorder_121506/|title= Equine Sleep Disorder Videos|accessdate=2007-03-23 |author=EQUUS Magazine Editors |work= Equisearch.com |publisher= EquiSearch}}</ref> This condition differs from [[narcolepsy]], although horses may also suffer from that disorder.<ref name="Smith">Smith ''Large Animal Internal Medicine'' pp. 1086<U+2013>1087</ref>

==Taxonomy and evolution==

{{Main|Evolution of the horse|Equus (genus)|Equidae}}

The horse adapted to survive in areas of wide-open terrain with sparse vegetation, surviving in an [[ecosystem]] where other large grazing animals, especially [[ruminant]]s, could not.<ref name="Budiansky">Budiansky ''The Nature of Horses'' p. 31</ref> Horses and other equids are [[odd-toed ungulate]]s of the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Odd-toed ungulate|Perissodactyla]], a group of mammals that was dominant during the [[Tertiary]] period. In the past, this order contained 14&nbsp;[[Family (biology)|families]], but only three<U+2014>[[Equidae]] (the horse and related species), the [[tapir]], and the [[rhinoceros]]<U+2014>have survived to the present day.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Perissodactyla.html|title= Order Perissodactyla|accessdate=2008-07-09 |author= Myers, Phil|work= Animal Diversity Web |publisher= University of Michigan}}</ref>
<!--new para, new idea, also refined structure a bit, some rephasing and rearranging-->
The earliest known member of the Equidae family was the ''[[Hyracotherium]]'', which lived between 45 and 55&nbsp;million years ago, during the [[Eocene]] period. It had 4&nbsp;toes on each front foot, and 3&nbsp;toes on each back foot.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fhc/hyraco1.htm|title= Hyracotherium|accessdate=2008-07-09 |work= Fossil Horses in Cyberspace |publisher= Florida Museum of Natural History}}</ref> The extra toe on the front feet soon disappeared with the ''[[Mesohippus]]'', which lived 32 to 37&nbsp;million years ago.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fhc/mesoh1.htm|title= Mesohippus|accessdate=2008-07-09|work= Fossil Horses in Cyberspace |publisher= Florida Museum of Natural History}}</ref> Over time, the extra side toes shrank in size until they vanished.

Thus proto-horses changed from leaf-eating forest-dwellers to grass-eating inhabitants of semi-arid regions worldwide, including the [[steppe]]s of Eurasia and the [[Great Plains]] of North America.

By about 15,000 years ago, ''Equus ferus'' was a widespread [[holarctic]] species.

===Wild species surviving into modern times===

Two horses nip and paw at each other, while the third moves towards the camera. They stand in open, rocky grassland, with forests in the distance.]]
A truly wild horse is a species or subspecies with no ancestors that were ever domesticated. Therefore, most "wild" horses today are actually [[feral horse]]s, animals that escaped or were turned loose from domestic herds and the descendants of those animals.<ref name=Olsen46>Olsen, "Horse Hunters of the Ice Age", ''Horses Through Time'', p. 46</ref> Only one truly wild horse species (''Equus ferus'') with two subspecies, the [[Tarpan]] and the [[Przewalski's Horse]], survived into recorded history. 

The only true wild horse alive today is the [[Przewalski's Horse]] (''Equus ferus przewalskii''), named after the Russian explorer [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]]. It is a rare Asian animal, also known as the Mongolian Wild Horse; [[Mongolia]]n people know it as the ''taki'', and the [[Kyrgyz]] people call it a ''kirtag''. The species was presumed extinct in the wild between 1969 and 1992, while a small breeding population survived in zoos around the world. In 1992, it was reestablished in the wild due to the conservation efforts of numerous zoos.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.zsl.org/info/media/press-releases/null,1790,PR.html|title= An extraordinary return from the brink of extinction for worlds last wild horse|date=2005-12-19|accessdate=2008-04-29|work= ZSL Press Releases|publisher= Zoological Society of London}}</ref> Today, a small wild breeding population exists in Mongolia.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.treemail.nl/takh/|title= Home|accessdate=2008-04-03 |publisher= The Foundation for the Preservation and Protection of the Przewalski Horse}}</ref><ref name=Dohner298>Dohner "Equines: Natural History" ''Encyclopedia of Historic Livestock and Poultry Breeds'' pp. 298<U+2013>299</ref> There are additional animals still maintained at zoos throughout the world.

The [[Tarpan]] or European Wild Horse (''Equus ferus ferus'') was found in Europe and much of Asia. It survived into the historical era, but became [[Extinction|extinct]] in 1909, when the last captive died in a Russian zoo.<ref name=Dohner300>Dohner "Equines: Natural History" ''Encyclopedia of Historic Livestock and Poultry Breeds'' p. 300</ref> Thus, the genetic line was lost. There have been attempts have been made to recreate the Tarpan,<ref name=OSU>{{cite web|url=http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/tarpan/|title=Tarpan|publisher=Oklahoma State University|work=Breeds of Livestock|accessdate=January 13, 2009}}</ref><ref name=Dohner300/><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=894&dat=20020621&id=YiALAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yFIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6481,3069519|journal=The Daily Courier|date=June 21, 2002|accessdate=2009-10-21|title=Ponies from the past?: Oregon couple revives prehistoric Tarpan horses}}</ref> which resulted in horses with outward physical similarities, but nonetheless descended from domesticated ancestors and not true wild horses.

Periodically, populations of horses in isolated areas are speculated to be relic populations of wild horses, but generally have been proven to be feral or domestic.

===Other modern equids===
{{Main|Equus (genus)}}
Besides the horse, there are seven other species of [[genus]] ''Equus'' in the Equidae [[family]]. These are the ass or [[donkey]], ''Equus asinus''; the [[mountain zebra]], ''Equus zebra''; [[plains zebra]], ''Equus burchelli''; [[Gr<U+00E9>vy's Zebra|Gr<U+00E9>vy's zebra]], ''Equus grevyi''; the [[kiang]], ''Equus kiang''; and the [[onager]], ''Equus hemionus''.<ref>http://www.bucknell.edu/MSW3/browse.asp?id=14100020</ref>

Horses can [[crossbreed]] with other members of their genus. The most common [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] is the [[mule]], a cross between a "jack" (male donkey) and a [[mare]]. A related hybrid, a [[hinny]], is a cross between a stallion and a [[jenny (donkey)|jenny]] (female donkey).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishmulesociety.org.uk/|title= Mule Information|accessdate=2008-07-10 |work= BMS Website|publisher= British Mule Society}}</ref> Other hybrids include the [[zorse]], a cross between a zebra and a horse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1408717.stm|title=Zebra hybrid is cute surprise|date=June 26, 2001|accessdate=2010-02-06|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> With rare exceptions, most hybrids are [[infertility|sterile]] and cannot reproduce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12260255 |title=Befuddling Birth: The Case of the Mule's Foal|accessdate=2008-08-16|author= |work=All Things Considered|publisher=National Public Radio}}</ref>

==Domestication==
{{Main|Domestication of the horse}}
Domestication of the horse most likely took place in central Asia prior to 3500&nbsp;BCE. Two major sources of information are used to determine where and when the horse was first domesticated and how the domesticated horse spread around the world. The first source is based on [[Paleontology|palaeological]] and [[archaeological]] discoveries, the second source is a comparison of DNA obtained from modern horses to that from bones and teeth of ancient horse remains. 

The earliest archaeological evidence for the [[domestication of the horse]] comes from sites in [[Ukraine]] and [[Kazakhstan]], dating to approximately 3,500<U+2013>4,000&nbsp;BCE.<ref>Outram, A.K., Stear, N.A., Bendrey, R., Olsen, S., Kasparov, A., Zaibert, V., Thorpe, N. and Evershed, R.P. 2009 The Earliest Horse Harnessing and Milking Science. 323(5919): 1332-1335</ref><ref>Matossian ''Shaping World History'' p. 43 See also: {{cite web |title=Podcast |url=http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/archives/08-09/qq-2009-03-07.html|work=Quirks and Quarks Podcast with Bob Macdonald |publisher= CBC Radio |date=2009-03-07|accessdate=2009-09-14}}</ref> By 3000&nbsp;BCE, the horse was completely domesticated and by 2000&nbsp;BCE there was a sharp increase in the number of horse bones found in human settlements in northwestern Europe, indicating the spread of domesticated horses throughout the continent.<ref>Evans ''Horse Breeding and Management'' p. 56</ref> The most recent, but most irrefutable evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse remains were interred with chariots in graves of the [[Sintashta]] and [[Petrovka settlement|Petrovka]] cultures circa 2100 BCE.<ref name="Kuznetsov2006">{{ cite journal | last = Kuznetsov | first = P.

Domestication is also studied by using the genetic material of present day horses and comparing it with the genetic material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations. The variation in the genetic material shows that very few wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse,<ref name=Lau>{{cite journal|author=Lau, A. N., Peng, L., Goto, H., Chemnick, L., Ryder, O.

Before the availability of DNA techniques to resolve the questions related to the domestication of the horse, various hypothesis were proposed. One classification was based on body types and conformation, suggesting the presence of four basic prototypes that had adapted to their environment prior to domestication.<ref name="Bennett7">Bennett, ''Conquerors'', p.7</ref> Another hypothesis held that the four prototypes originated from a single wild species and that all different body types were entirely a result of [[selective breeding]] after domestication.<ref>Edwards, G. ''The Arabian,'' pp 1, 3</ref>  However, the lack of a detectable substructure <!--huh?  what's that? Can we explain in everyday language?--> in the horse has resulted in a rejection of both hypotheses.<!--I will add the ref for it once I find the book back--><!--OK-->

===Breeds===
{{Main|Horse breed||List of horse breeds|Horse breeding}}
Horse breeds are groups of horses with distinctive characteristics that are transmitted consistently to their offspring, such as [[equine conformation|conformation]], color, performance ability, or disposition. These inherited traits result from a combination of natural crosses and [[artificial selection]] methods. Horses have been [[Selective breeding|selectively bred]] since their [[domestication of the horse|domestication]]. Breeds developed due to a need for "form to function", the necessity to develop certain characteristics in order to perform a particular type of work.<ref name=Sponenberg155>Sponenberg, "The Proliferation of Horse Breeds", ''Horses Through Time'', p. 155</ref> Thus, powerful but refined breeds such as the [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]] developed as riding horses that also had a great aptitude for [[dressage]],<ref name=Sponenberg155/> while heavy draft horses such as the [[Clydesdale (horse)|Clydesdale]] developed out of a need to perform demanding [[farm]] work and pull heavy wagons.<ref>Sponenberg, "The Proliferation of Horse Breeds", ''Horses Through Time'', pp. 156<U+2013>57</ref> Other horse breeds developed specifically for light agricultural work, carriage and road work, various sport disciplines, or simply as pets.<ref name=Spon162>Sponenberg, "The Proliferation of Horse Breeds", ''Horses Through Time'', p. 162</ref> Some breeds developed through centuries of crossings with other breeds, while others, such as [[Tennessee Walking Horse]]s and [[Morgan horse|Morgans]], descended from a single [[foundation bloodstock|foundation sire]]. There are more than 300&nbsp;horse breeds in the world today.<ref>Hedge ''Horse Conformation'' pp. 307<U+2013>308</ref>

However, the concept of [[purebred]] bloodstock and a controlled, written [[breed registry]] only became of significant importance in modern times. Sometimes purebred horses are called [[Thoroughbred]]s, which is incorrect; "Thoroughbred" is a specific breed of horse, while a "purebred" is a horse (or any other animal) with a defined [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]] recognized by a breed registry.<ref name=Ensminger424>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 424</ref> An early example of people who practiced selective [[horse breeding]] were the [[Bedouin]], who had a reputation for careful practices, keeping extensive pedigrees of their [[Arabian horse]]s and placing great value upon pure bloodlines.<ref>Edwards ''The Arabian'', pp. 22<U+2013>23</ref>These pedigrees were originally transmitted via an [[oral tradition]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.waho.org/History.html|title= Is Purity the Issue? |accessdate=2008-04-29 |work= WAHO Publication Number 21 January 1998|publisher= World Arabian Horse Organization}}</ref> In the 14th century, [[Carthusian]] monks of southern Spain kept meticulous pedigrees of bloodstock lineages still found today in the [[Andalusian horse]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/andalusian/index.htm|title= Andalusian |accessdate=2008-04-29|work= Breeds of Livestock|publisher= Oklahoma State University}}</ref> One of the earliest formal registries was [[General Stud Book]] for Thoroughbreds, which began in 1791 and traced back to the [[foundation bloodstock]] for the breed.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.britishhorseracing.com/goracing/racing/racehorses/history.asp|title= History of Thoroughbreds |accessdate=2008-04-03|work= Britishhorseracing.com|publisher= British Horseracing Authority}}</ref>

==Interaction with humans==
Worldwide, horses play a role within human cultures. Horses are used for leisure activities, sports, and working purposes. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) estimates that in 2008, there were almost 59,000,000 horses in the world, with around 33,500,000 in the Americas, 13,800,000 in Asia and 6,300,000 in Europe and smaller portions in Africa and Oceania. There are estimated to be 9,500,000 horses in the United States alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/573/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=573#ancor|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|date=December 16, 2009|accessdate=2010-02-05|title=FAO Stat&nbsp;<U+2014> Live Animals}}</ref> The [[American Horse Council]] estimates that horse-related activities have a direct impact on the economy of the United States of over $39 billion, and when indirect spending is considered, the impact is over $102 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cthorsecouncil.org/AHC2005JuneEconStudy.pdf|format=PDF|title= Most Comprehensive Horse Study Ever Reveals A Nearly $40 Billion Impact On The U.S. Economy|accessdate=2005-06-20|work= American Horse Council Press Release|publisher= American Horse Council}}</ref> In a 2004 "poll" conducted by [[Animal Planet]], more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries voted for the horse as the world's 4th favorite animal.<ref name=IOL>{{cite web |url= http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?newslett=1&em=28164a99a20041206ah&click_id=29&art_id=qw1102325040750B216&set_id=1|title=Tiger tops dog as world's favourite animal |accessdate=2008-04-03 |work= Independent Online|publisher= Independent}}</ref>

Communication between human and horse is paramount in any equestrian activity;<ref name="Olsen"/> to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a [[saddle]] on their backs to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a [[bridle]] or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control.<ref>Edwards, ''Horses'', pp. 32<U+2013>34</ref> Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle,<ref>Self, ''Riding Simplified'', p. 55</ref> and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear.<ref>Thorson "Rugged Lark" ''Legends 7'' p. 218</ref> Many horses are also [[Driving (horse)|driven]], which requires a [[horse harness|harness]], bridle, and some type of [[horse-drawn vehicle|vehicle]].<ref>Mettler, ''Horse Sense'', pp. 47<U+2013>54</ref>

===Sport===
<!-- There is a whole article about Equestrianism for all details about every possible sport. This article should only give the bare summary. So, please do not add elaborate sections of your own favorite horse sport here. -->

{{Main|Equestrianism|Horse racing|Horse training|Horse tack}}
Historically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races. Equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and honed the excellent horsemanship that was needed in battle. Many sports, such as [[dressage]], [[eventing]] and [[show jumping]], have origins in [[horses in warfare|military training]], which were focused on control and balance of both horse and rider. Other sports, such as [[rodeo]], developed from practical skills such as those needed on working [[ranch]]es and [[Station (Australian agriculture)|stations]]. Sport hunting from horseback evolved from earlier practical hunting techniques.<ref name="Olsen">Olsen, "In the Winner's Circle", ''Horses Through Time'', pp. 105, 111<U+2013>113, 121</ref> [[Horse racing]] of all types evolved from impromptu competitions between riders or drivers. All forms of competition, requiring demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment for each sport. The popularity of equestrian sports through the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have disappeared after horses stopped being used in combat.<ref>Olsen, "In the Winner's Circle", ''Horses Through Time'', p. 105</ref>

Horses are trained to be ridden or driven in a variety of sporting competitions. Examples include [[show jumping]], [[dressage]], three-day [[eventing]], [[combined driving|competitive driving]], [[endurance riding]], [[Gymkhana (equestrian)|gymkhana]], [[rodeo]]s, and [[fox hunting]].<ref>Edwards, ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', pp. 346<U+2013>356, 366<U+2013>371</ref> [[Horse show]]s, which have their origins in medieval European fairs, are held around the world. They host a huge range of classes, covering all of the mounted and harness disciplines, as well as [[halter (horse show)|"In-hand"]] classes where the horses are led, rather than ridden, to be evaluated on their conformation. The method of judging varies with the discipline, but winning usually depends on style and ability of both horse and rider.<ref>Edwards, ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', pp. 376<U+2013>377</ref>
Sports such as [[polo]] do not judge the horse itself, but rather use the horse as a partner for human competitors as a necessary part of the game. Although the horse requires specialized training to participate, the details of its performance are not judged, only the result of the rider's actions<U+2014>be it getting a ball through a goal or some other task.<ref name=Edwards360>Edwards, ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', p. 360</ref> Examples of these sports of partnership between human and horse include [[jousting]], in which the main goal is for one rider to unseat the other,<ref>Collins, ''Encyclopedia of Traditional British Rural Sports'', pp. 173<U+2013>174</ref> and [[buzkashi]], a team game played throughout [[Central Asia]], the aim being to capture a goat carcass while on horseback.<ref name=Edwards360/>

[[Horse racing]] is an equestrian sport and major international industry, watched in almost every nation of the world. There are three types: "flat" racing; [[Steeplechase|steeplechasing]], i.e. racing over jumps; and [[harness racing]], where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a small, light cart known as a [[sulky]].<ref>Edwards, ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', pp. 332<U+2013>337</ref> A major part of horse racing's economic importance lies in the [[Gambling#Gambling on horse races|gambling]] associated with it.<ref>Campbell, ''National Gambling Impact Study Commission Final Report'', p. 111</ref>

There are certain jobs that horses do very well, and no technology has yet developed to fully replace them. For example, [[mounted police]] horses are still effective for certain types of patrol duties and crowd control.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/uspp/fhorsepage.htm |title= Horse Mounted Unit|accessdate=2008-04-07|work= United States Park Police|publisher= National Park Service}}</ref> Cattle [[ranch]]es still require riders on horseback to round up cattle that are scattered across remote, rugged terrain.<ref>Edwards, ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', pp. 226<U+2013>227</ref> [[Search and rescue]] organizations in some countries depend upon [[mounted search and rescue|mounted]] teams to locate people, particularly hikers and children, and to provide disaster relief assistance.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sbcsheriff.org/msru_job.html|title= Volunteer Mounted Search and Rescue Unit|accessdate=2008-07-08|work= Employment|publisher= San Benito County Sheriff's Office}}</ref> Horses can also be used in areas where it is necessary to avoid vehicular disruption to delicate soil, such as nature reserves. They may also be the only form of transport allowed in [[wilderness area]]s. Horses are quieter than motorized vehicles. [[Law enforcement officer]]s such as [[park ranger]]s or [[game warden]]s may use horses for patrols, and horses or mules may also be used for clearing trails or other work in areas of rough terrain where vehicles are less effective.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/publications/success_story_updates/2003-05.pdf |format=PDF|title=Success Stories |accessdate=2008-04-20 |author=US Forest Service |year=2003 |month=May |chapter=Mules Key in Accomplishing Trail Work |publisher=US Department of Agriculture |pages=4 }}</ref>

Although machinery has replaced horses in many parts of the world, an estimated 100&nbsp;million horses, donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas.

Therapeutic riding is used to mentally and physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through improved balance and coordination, increased self-confidence, and a greater feeling of freedom and independence.<ref>Bush, et al., ''The Principles of Teaching Riding'', p. 58</ref> The benefits of equestrian activity for people with disabilities has also been recognized with the addition of equestrian events to the [[Paralympic Games]] and recognition of para-equestrian events by the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports]] (FEI).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fei.org/disciplines/dressage/about-para-equestrian-dressage|title= About Para Equestrian Dressage|accessdate=2010-03-07 |publisher= Federation Equestre Internationale}}</ref> [[Hippotherapy]] and [[therapeutic horseback riding]] are names for different physical, occupational, and speech therapy treatment strategies that utilize equine movement. In hippotherapy, a therapist uses the horse's movement to improve their patient's cognitive, coordination, balance, and fine motor skills, whereas therapeutic horseback riding uses specific riding skills.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.narha.org/PDFFiles/FAQ_Hippotherapy.pdf|format=PDF|title= Frequently Asked Questions About Hippotherapy|accessdate=2008-07-08 |work= FAQ&nbsp;<U+2013> AHA, April 2005|publisher= American Hippotherapy Association}}</ref>

Horses also provide psychological benefits to people whether they actually ride or not. "Equine-assisted" or "equine-facilitated" therapy is a form of experiential [[psychotherapy]] that uses horses as companion animals to assist people with mental illness, including anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, mood disorders, behavioral difficulties, and those who are going through major life changes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.narha.org/SecEFMHA/FactSheet.asp|title=Equine Facilitated Psychotherapy (EFP) Fact Sheet|accessdate=2008-07-08 |publisher= Equine Facilitated Mental Health Association}}</ref> There are also experimental programs using horses in [[prison]] settings.
