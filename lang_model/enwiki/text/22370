'''U.S. Route 70''' is an east-west [[United States highway]] that runs for 2,385 miles (3,838 km) from eastern [[North Carolina]] to east-central [[Arizona]]. As can be derived from its number, it is a major east-west highway of the [[Southern United States|Southern]] and Southwestern United States.  It formerly ran from coast to coast, with the current Eastern terminus near the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in [[North Carolina]], and the former Western terminus near the [[Pacific Ocean]] in [[California]].
Prior to the completion of the [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate system]], Highway 70 was sometimes referred to as the "Broadway of America", due to its status as one of the main east-west thoroughfares in the nation.

===Arizona===
U.S. 70 begins in [[Globe, Arizona|Globe]] at a junction with [[U.S. Route 60 (Arizona)|U.S. Route 60]], concurrent with [[Arizona State Route 77|State Route 77]]. SR 77 splits off east of town. U.S. 70 then enters the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation and runs southeast for 17&nbsp;miles<ref name="rmcn-07-az">{{cite map|publisher=Rand McNally|title=The Road Atlas `07|year=2007|page=8-9}}</ref> (27&nbsp;km) to [[Peridot, Arizona|Peridot]], where it crosses [[State Route 170 (Arizona)|Indian Route 9]]. It has no other highway junctions until [[Safford, Arizona|Safford]], where it begins a ten-mile<ref name="rmcn-07-az"/> (16&nbsp;km) overlap with [[U.S. 191]]. U.S. 70 then runs an additional {{convert|37|mi|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name="rmcn-07-az"/> (59&nbsp;km) before crossing into New Mexico east of [[Franklin, Arizona|Franklin]].

===New Mexico===
After entering the state of New Mexico, U.S. 70 heads southeast. Five&nbsp;miles<ref name="rmcn-07-nm">{{cite map|publisher=Rand McNally|title=The Road Atlas `07|year=2007|page=68}}</ref> (8&nbsp;km) after crossing the state line, it serves as the southern terminus for [[New Mexico State Road 92]]. U.S. 70 does not have another highway junction for 21&nbsp;mi (34 km)<ref name="rmcn-07-nm"/>, where it meets [[New Mexico State Road 464|State Roads 464]] and [[New Mexico State Road 90|90]] three&nbsp;miles<ref name="rmcn-07-nm"/> (5&nbsp;km) north of [[Lordsburg, New Mexico|Lordsburg]]. At Lordsburg, U.S. 70 joins with [[Interstate 10]] eastbound, splitting off in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]]. In Las Cruces, U.S. 70 also meets [[Interstate 25]]. 

Upon departing Las Cruces, U.S. 70 crosses the [[White Sands Missile Range]]. Overhead missile tests can close the highway for a few hours; this generally happens once or twice a week.<ref>{{cite web|last=Crossley|first=John|url=http://www.americansouthwest.net/new_mexico/white_sands/national_monument.html|title=White Sands National Monument, Alamogordo, New Mexico|work=The American Southwest|accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref><ref>[http://www.arizonaroads.com/wrong/missilexing.jpg Signage indicating closings]</ref> It then runs concurrent with [[U.S. 54]] between [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]] and [[Tularosa, New Mexico|Tularosa]]. After splitting off to the northeast, U.S. 70 runs across the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation and near the resort town of [[Ruidoso, New Mexico|Ruidoso]]. In [[Hondo, New Mexico|Hondo]], it begins another concurrency, this time with [[U.S. 380]]. U.S. 70 then bypasses [[Roswell, New Mexico|Roswell]] to the northwest, together with [[U.S. 285]]. U.S. 70 then heads off to the northeast, running through [[Portales, New Mexico|Portales]] and [[Clovis, New Mexico|Clovis]] before entering Texas at [[Texico, New Mexico|Texico]].

===Texas===
US 70 enters Texas joined with [[U.S. Highway 60 (Texas)|US 60]] and [[U.S. Highway 84 (Texas)|US 84]]. US 60 splits off to the northeast in [[Farwell, Texas]], just over the state line. US 70/84 then angle southeast to [[Muleshoe, Texas|Muleshoe]], where the two routes split. US 70 heads due east, meeting [[U.S. Highway 385 (Texas)|US 385]] at [[Springlake, Texas|Springlake]], and having an interchange with [[Interstate 27 (Texas)|Interstate 27]] in [[Plainview, Texas|Plainview]]. US 70 then arcs toward the south to begin a concurrency with [[U.S. Highway 62 (Texas)|US 62]] in [[Floydada, Texas|Floydada]]. The two routes head east to [[Paducah, Texas]], where US 62 splits off to the north to join with [[U.S. Highway 83 (Texas)|US 83]]. US 70 then proceeds to [[Vernon, Texas|Vernon]], where it overlaps [[U.S. Highway 287 (Texas)|US 287]] and [[U.S. Highway 183 (Texas)|US 183]] (and has a junction with [[U.S. Highway 283 (Texas)|US 283]]). Near [[Oklaunion, Texas]], US 70/183 split off to the north to cross the [[Red River (Mississippi watershed)|Red River]] into [[Oklahoma]].

===Oklahoma===
US-183 splits off US-70 three&nbsp;miles<ref name="odot-map-2005">{{cite map|publisher=Oklahoma Department of Transportation|title=Official State Map|edition=2005-2006}}</ref> (5&nbsp;km) north of the state line, in the town of [[Davidson, Oklahoma|Davidson]]. It then has an interchange (Exit 5) with [[Interstate 44 (Oklahoma)|Interstate 44]], serving as the southern terminus of the [[H.E. Bailey Turnpike]]. US-70 then heads south of [[Waurika, Oklahoma|Waurika]]. US-70 then becomes a four-lane divided highway near [[Wilson, Oklahoma|Wilson]] and runs through [[Lone Grove, Oklahoma|Lone Grove]] before entering the city of [[Ardmore, Oklahoma|Ardmore]], where it briefly heads south on [[Interstate 35 (Oklahoma)|Interstate 35]], bypassing the central business district. US-70 serves as the southern terminus of [[U.S. Highway 177 (Oklahoma)|US-177]] in [[Madill, Oklahoma|Madill]]. US-70 then heads to [[Durant, Oklahoma|Durant]], where it has an interchange with the [[U.S. Highway 69 (Oklahoma)|US-69]]/[[U.S. Highway 75 (Oklahoma)|75]] freeway. 

East of [[Soper, Oklahoma|Soper]], US-70 joins with [[U.S. Highway 271 (Oklahoma)|US-271]]. The two routes then approach [[Hugo, Oklahoma|Hugo]], where they serve as the southern terminus of the [[Indian Nation Turnpike]]. US-271 also splits off at this interchange, continuing the freeway southbound from the turnpike. US-70 then heads through downtown Hugo. It then bypasses [[Idabel, Oklahoma|Idabel]] to the north (with Bypass US-70 providing a western and southern bypass). It then meets [[U.S. Highway 259 (Oklahoma)|US-259]] and [[Oklahoma State Highway 3|State Highway 3]] northeast of town and overlaps them into [[Broken Bow, Oklahoma|Broken Bow]], forming a [[wrong-way concurrency]] with SH-3. US-70 then splits off to the east in Broken Bow before leaving the state.

===Arkansas===
U.S. 70 enters Arkansas eight&nbsp;miles<ref name="ar-07-map">{{cite map|publisher=[[Arkansas Highway Transportation Department]]|title=Arkansas State Highway Map|edition=2007}}</ref> (13&nbsp;km) west of [[DeQueen, Arkansas|DeQueen]]. U.S. 70 bypasses the town to the north. Northeast of the city, it meets [[U.S. 71]] and overlaps with it for {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}}. It then heads northwest for to [[Dierks, Arkansas|Dierks]], where it begins a concurrency with [[U.S. 278]]. U.S. 70 then heads east-northeast to [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]], which it bypasses to the south on a freeway alignment shared with [[U.S. 270]]. U.S. 70 then heads east to join with [[Interstate 30]] at Exit 111 south of [[Benton, Arkansas|Benton]]. The two highways remain joined to the state capital, [[Little Rock]], where U.S. 70B splits off from I-30 and U.S. 70 at Exit 132, and runs through downtown Little Rock, having an interchange with [[Interstate 630]] before crossing the [[Arkansas River]] in to [[North Little Rock, Arkansas|North Little Rock]]. U.S. 70 remains with I-30 through Little Rock, crossing the Arkansas River into North Little Rock. It then splits off from I-30, and is rejoined by U.S. 70B at Exit 141B, and serves as the northern terminus of [[U.S. Route 165]]. U.S. 70 then crosses [[Interstate 440]] and leaves the Little Rock area, paralleled by [[Interstate 40]].

U.S. 70 continues its alignment near I-40 throughout eastern Arkansas, generally about two or three miles (5 km) apart. I-40 bypasses [[Forrest City, Arkansas|Forrest City]] to the north, while U.S. 70 serves the city center. The two routes remain close through [[West Memphis, Arkansas]], where U.S. 70 runs along Broadway Blvd. Finally, U.S. 70 joins with [[Interstate 55]] to cross the [[Mississippi River]] into Tennessee.

===Tennessee===
[[Image:US64 US70 US79 Memphis.jpg|thumb|250px|US64/US70/US79 overlap on Summer Ave in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. ([[2008]])]]
US 70 enters [[Tennessee]], as well as the city of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], concurrent with [[Interstate 55]], [[U.S. Route 61|US 61]], [[U.S. Route 64|US 64]], and [[U.S. Route 79|US 79]]. At exit 12, the northernmost exit on I-55 in the state, I-55 turns south; however, the four US routes continue east onto the at-grade Crump Boulevard. US 61 splits from the concurrency soon afterward, heading south along 3rd Street to exit the city. US 64, 70 and 79, however, remain overlapped through downtown Memphis, following Danny Thomas Boulevard north to Union Avenue, Union east to East Parkway (briefly overlapping with [[U.S. Route 51]] along the western portion of Union), then East Parkway north to Summer Avenue, where the triple concurrency turns east. Near the city line, US 64/70/79 interchanges with [[Interstate 40]] at exit 12A.

Past the Memphis city limits in the suburb of [[Bartlett, Tennessee|Bartlett]], US 64 separates from US 70/79, taking a more southerly routing through the state. US 70 and US 79, meanwhile, head to the northeast, paralleling I-40 to [[Brownsville, Tennessee|Brownsville]]. East of city, US 79 breaks from US 70, following US 70 Alternate out of the city to the northeast. US 79, now concurrent with only its unsigned designation of [[Tennessee State Route 1|State Route 1]], heads east, interchanging with I-40 at exit 66 before entering [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]]. The route continues northeast from the city, meeting I-40 once more at exit 87 just outside the city limits. At [[Huntingdon, Tennessee|Huntingdon]], US 70 Alternate rejoins US 70 as the main route turns to the east toward [[New Johnsonville, Tennessee|New Johnsonville]], where it crosses the [[Tennessee River]].

From the river, US 70 continues eastward through [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]] and [[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]] to the [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] area. Southwest of the city near [[Pegram, Tennessee|Pegram]], [[U.S. Route 70S]] splits off from US 70; however, US 70 continues to be signed as US 70 instead of US 70N. US 70 follows I-40 into Nashville, meeting the concurrent I-40/[[Interstate 65|I-65]] immediately west of the city center. The route turns south, acting as [[collector/distributor roads]] for I-40/I-65 for two blocks before joining [[U.S. Route 431|US 431]] and US 70S on a brief overlap. At an intersection with the concurrent [[U.S. Route 31|US 31]]/[[U.S. Route 41|US 41]], US 431 and US 70S split from US 70. US 70 progresses eastward, roughly paralleling the [[Cumberland River]] to an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 155|State Route 155]] east of downtown. US 70, now paired with [[Tennessee State Route 24|State Route 24]], heads east out of Nashville to [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]], where [[U.S. Route 70N]] breaks from the main US 70. US 70 heads southeast, passing through [[Smithville, Tennessee|Smithville]] before rejoining US 70S in [[Sparta, Tennessee|Sparta]] and US 70N to the east in [[Crossville, Tennessee|Crossville]].

From Crossville eastward to the [[North Carolina]] state line, US 70 closely parallels I-40, passing through the [[Roane County, Tennessee|Roane County]] cities of [[Rockwood, Tennessee|Rockwood]] and [[Kingston, Tennessee|Kingston]]. At [[Dixie Lee Junction, Tennessee|Dixie Lee Junction]] in eastern [[Loudon County, Tennessee|Loudon County]] US 70 (also known as the [[Dixie Highway]]) intersects [[U.S. Route 11|US 11]] (the [[Lee Highway]]) and the two highways are concurrent from the junction intersection eastward through [[Farragut, Tennessee|Farragut]] and into [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]. In Farragut and west of downtown Knoxville US 70 carries the name [[Kingston Pike]]. On the east side of Knoxville it becomes concurrent with [[U.S. Route 25W|US 25W]] and [[U.S. Route 11E|US 11E]] and carries the name Asheville Highway from Knoxville to the community of [[Trentville, Tennessee|Trentville]] in eastern [[Knox County, Tennessee|Knox County]]. At Trentville, US 11E separates from the concurrency. US 25W remains overlapped with US 70 to [[Newport, Tennessee|Newport]], where US 70 is joined by [[U.S. Route 25E|US 25E]], which becomes [[U.S. Route 25|US 25]]. US 25 and US 70 remain concurrent into [[North Carolina]].

===North Carolina===
U.S. 70 enters North Carolina on a two-lane road, also signed as [[U.S. Route 25]].  The duplex is signed along a divided highway from [[Marshall]] to [[U.S. Route 19]] north of [[Asheville]] where it splits off from U.S. 25.  From here, U.S. 70 parallels [[Interstate 40]], passing through the towns of [[Marion, North Carolina|Marion]], [[Hickory, North Carolina|Hickory]], [[Statesville, North Carolina|Statesville]] and [[Salisbury, North Carolina|Salisbury]], where it changes course and heads northeast.

U.S. 70 parallels [[Interstate 85]] to [[High Point]], sharing a divided highway with [[U.S. Route 29]]. The two roads separate in [[Greensboro]], and U.S. Route 70 continues east along the Interstate 40 corridor. Halfway to the Research Triangle, US 70 passes through the major retail district for Burlington. It then becomes a two lane road until it reaches [[Durham]] where U.S 70 turns southeast as a divided highway.  The road passes straight through downtown [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], before heading back east and away from Interstate 40.

A divided highway from Raleigh to the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]], U.S. 70 traverses Eastern North Carolina in an east by southeasterly direction. As of 2008, the [[Clayton Bypass]] carries US 70 around [[Clayton, North Carolina]]. It is signed along as bypass roads around [[Smithfield, North Carolina|Smithfield]] (through [[Selma, North Carolina|Selma]]) and [[Goldsboro]] and a [[freeway]] around [[New Bern]] and is a divided highway again through the [[Croatan National Forest]]and [[Havelock]], passing [[Atlantic Beach]] in [[Carteret County]], the eastern terminus of [[North Carolina Highway 24|NC 24]].  From here, U.S. 70 maintains a two-lane road with a widened shoulder, to the town of [[Lola]] and the southern terminus of [[North Carolina Highway 12|NC 12]].  The last few miles of U.S. 70 are signed along a road from Lola to its eastern terminus in the town of [[Atlantic]].

== History ==
{{Expand-section|date=June 2008}}
Originally it reached downtown [[Los Angeles]] even though it was concurrent with U.S Route 99 and/or U.S. Highway 60 throughout its course west of Globe, Arizona. Beginning in 1964 it was [[decommissioned highway|decommissioned]] in favor of [[Interstate 10]] or US 60.

[[Bruce Springsteen]]'s 1975 song, [[Thunder Road (song)]] immortalizes the 1958 [[Robert Mitchum]] film, [[Thunder Road]] about a family of anarchistic moonshiners who engage in run-ins with the police. The Mitchum film is based on a real life incident in which a moonshiner perished on the road whilst on the run from the police.

== Bannered routes ==
{{main|Bannered routes of U.S. Route 70}}

===Branch routes===
US 70 has two additional branches in Tennessee, '''US 70N''' and [[US 70S]].  This split is unique, in that it is the only existing instance of a N/S split of a U.S. highway.  Further, US 70 does not "disappear" at these splits; thus, these two highways serve as additional branches of the main route.  US 70N begins in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]], just east of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and ends in [[Crossville, Tennessee|Crossville, TN]]; US 70S begins in [[Pegram, Tennessee|Pegram, TN]], just west of Nashville, and ends in [[Sparta, Tennessee|Sparta, TN]] (a few miles west of Crossville).  Historically, both split routes began in Pegram and ended in Crossville.

===Alternate routes===
Additionally, there is an Alternate US 70 between [[Brownsville, Tennessee|Brownsville]] and [[Huntingdon, Tennessee|Huntingdon]]. Signage along this route and most maps show it as '''US 70A'''.

There is another US 70A, approximately {{convert|9|mi|km}} long, from [[Selma, North Carolina]] to near [[Princeton, North Carolina]].  Its western terminus in Selma lies on US-70 in between the endpoints of the US 70 Business Route through [[Smithfield, North Carolina]].
