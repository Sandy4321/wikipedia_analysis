==History==
[[File:Gerard philips.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gerard Philips]]]]
The Philips Company was founded in 1891 by [[Gerard Philips]] and his father [[Frederik Philips|Frederik]]. Frederik, a banker based in [[Zaltbommel]], financed the purchase and setup of a modest, empty factory building in Eindhoven, where the company started the production of carbon-filament lamps and other electro-technical products in 1892. This first factory has been adapted and is used as a Museum devoted to [[light sculpture]]<ref>[http://www.kunstlichtkunst.nl/ Kunstlichtkunst.nl], Centrum Kunstlicht</ref>

In 1895, after a difficult first few years and near bankruptcy, the Philipses brought in [[Anton Philips|Anton]], Gerard's younger brother by sixteen years.  Though he had earned a degree in engineering, Anton started work as a sales representative; soon, however, he began to contribute many important business ideas. With Anton's arrival, the family business began to expand rapidly, resulting in the founding of Philips Metaalgloeilampfabriek N.V. (Philips Metal Filament Lamp Factory Inc.) in Eindhoven in 1907, followed in 1912 by the foundation of Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken N.V. (Philips Lightbulb Factories Inc.). After Gerard and Anton Philips changed their family business by founding the Philips incorporation, they laid the foundations for the later electronics multinational.

In the 1920s, the company started to manufacture other products, such as [[vacuum tubes]]. In 1939 they introduced their electric [[razor]], the ''[[Philishave]]'' (marketed in the USA using the [[Norelco]] brand name). The "Chapel" is a radio with built-in loudspeaker, which was designed during the early 1930s.

===Philips Radio===
[[File:Philips 930.jpg|thumb|upright|Philips chapel radio model 930A, 1931|alt=Curved, triangular radio with brown wooden cabinet]]
On 11 March 1927 Philips went on the air with shortwave radio station [[PCJJ]] (later PCJ) which was joined in 1929 by sister station PHI. PHI broadcast in Dutch to the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]) while PCJJ broadcast in English, Spanish and German to the rest of the world.

The international program on Sundays commenced in 1928, with host Eddie Startz hosting the ''[[Happy Station]]'' show, which became the world's longest-running shortwave program.  Broadcasts from the Netherlands were interrupted by the German invasion in May 1940. The Germans commandeered the transmitters in Huizen to use for pro-Nazi broadcasts, some originating from Germany, others concerts from Dutch broadcasters under German control.

Philips Radio did not resume after [[Emancipation|liberation]]. Instead' the two shortwave stations were nationalised in 1946 and renamed as [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]], the Dutch International Service.  Some PCJ programs, such as ''[[Happy Station]]'', continued on the new station.

===Stirling Engine===
Philips was instrumental in the revival of the [[Stirling engine]] when, in the early 1930s, the management decided that offering a low-power portable generator would assist in expanding sales of its radios into parts of the world where mains electricity was unavailable and the supply of batteries uncertain. Engineers at the company's research lab carried out a systematic comparison of various power sources and determined that the almost forgotten Stirling engine would be most suitable, citing its quiet operation (both audibly and in terms of radio interference) and ability to run on a variety of heat sources (common lamp oil&nbsp;<U+2013> "cheap and available everywhere"&nbsp;<U+2013> was favoured).<ref>C.M. Hargreaves (1991). The Philips Stirling Engine. Elsevier Science. ISBN 0-444-88463-7. pp.28<U+2013>30</ref> They were also aware that, unlike steam and internal combustion engines, virtually no serious development work had been carried out on the Stirling engine for many years and asserted that modern materials and know-how should enable great improvements.<ref>Philips Technical Review Vol.9 No.4 page 97 (1947)</ref>

Encouraged by their first experimental engine, which produced 16&nbsp;W of shaft power from a bore and stroke of {{nowrap|30mm <U+00D7> 25mm}},<ref>C.M. Hargreaves (1991), Fig. 3</ref> various development models were produced in a program which continued throughout World War II. By the late 1940s the 'Type 10' was ready to be handed over to Philips' subsidiary Johan de Witt in Dordrecht to be productionised and incorporated into a generator set as originally planned. The result, rated at 180/200&nbsp;W electrical output from a bore and stroke of {{nowrap|55 mm x 27 mm}}, was designated MP1002CA (known as the "Bungalow set"). Production of an initial batch of 250 began in 1951, but it became clear that they could not be made at a competitive price besides which the advent of transistor radios with their much lower power requirements meant that the original rationale for the set was disappearing. Approximately 150 of these sets were eventually produced.<ref>C.M. Hargreaves (1991), p.61</ref>

In parallel with the generator set Philips developed experimental Stirling engines for a wide variety of applications and continued to work in the field until the late 1970s, though the only commercial success was the 'reversed Stirling engine' [[Applications of the Stirling engine#Stirling cryocoolers|cryocooler]]. However, they filed a large number of patents and amassed a wealth of information, which they later licensed to other companies.<ref>C.M. Hargreaves (1991), p.77</ref>

===World War II===
On 9 May 1940, the Philips directors learned that the German [[Battle of the Netherlands|invasion]] of the [[Netherlands]] was to take place the following day. Having prepared for this, [[Anton Philips]] and his son in law Frans Otten, as well as other Philips family members, fled to the United States, taking a large amount of the company capital with them. Operating from the US as the North American Philips Company, they managed to run the company throughout the war. At the same time, the company was moved (on paper) to the [[Netherlands Antilles]] to keep it out of American hands.

[[Frits Philips]], the son of Anton, was the only Philips family member to stay in the Netherlands.  He saved the lives of 382 Jews by convincing the Nazis that they were indispensable for the production process at Philips.<ref>[http://www.newscenter.philips.com/about/news/section-13674/article-14959.html About Philips&nbsp;<U+2013> Royal Philips<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref> In 1943 he was held at the internment camp for political prisoners at [[Vught]] for several months because a strike at his factory reduced production. For his actions in saving the hundreds of Jews, he was recognized by [[Yad Vashem]] in 1995 as a "[[Righteous Among the Nations]]".<ref>''The Encyclopedia of the Righteous Among the Nations: Rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust: The Netherlands''], Jerusalem: Yad Vashem, 2004, pp. 596<U+2013>597</ref>

===1945 to 2001===
After the war the company was moved back to the Netherlands, with their headquarters in [[Eindhoven]]. Many secret research facilities had been locked and successfully hidden from the invaders, which allowed the company to get up to speed again quickly after the war.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In 1949, the company began selling [[television set]]s.<ref name=waarom>{{cite news|title=Waarom stopt Philips met zelf televisies maken?|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2680/Economie/article/detail/1876925/2011/04/18/Waarom-stopt-Philips-met-zelf-televisies-maken.dhtml?utm_source=VK_bronNULL&utm_medium=vknieuwsbrief&utm_campaign=vknieuwsbrief|accessdate=18 April 2011|newspaper=[[de Volkskrant]]|date=18 April 2011}}</ref> In 1950, it formed [[Philips Records]].

Philips introduced the audio [[Compact Cassette|Compact Audio Cassette]] tape in 1963, and it was wildly successful. Compact cassettes were initially used for dictation machines for office typing [[shorthand|steno]]graphers and professional journalists. As their sound quality improved, cassettes would also be used to record sound and became the second mass media alongside [[vinyl records]] used to sell recorded music.

Philips introduced the first combination [[portable radio]] and cassette recorder, which was  marketed as the "radiorecorder," and is now better known as the [[boom box]]. Later, the cassette was used in telephone [[answering machine]]s, including a special form of cassette where the tape was wound on an endless loop. The C-cassette was used as the first [[mass storage device]] for early personal computers in the 1970s and 1980s. Philips reduced the cassette size for the professional needs with the [[Mini-Cassette]], although it would not be as successful as the [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] [[Microcassette]].  This became the predominant dictation medium up to the advent of fully digital dictation machines.{{citation needed}}

In 1972 Philips launched the world's first home [[video cassette recorder]], in England, the N1500.  Its relatively bulky video cassettes could record 30 minutes or 45 minutes. Later one-hour tapes were also offered. As competition came from [[Sony]]'s [[Betamax]] and the [[VHS]] group of manufacturers, Philips introduced the N1700 system which allowed double-length recording. For the first time, a 2-hour movie could fit onto one video cassette.  In 1977, the company unveiled a special promotional film for this system in the UK, featuring comedian [[Denis Norden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/105150|title=BFI <U+2013> Film & TV Database <U+2013> The Philips Time Machine (1977)|work=The [[British Film Institute]] Web Database|accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref>

The concept was quickly copied by the Japanese makers, whose tapes were significantly cheaper. Philips made one last attempt at a new standard for video recorders with the [[Video 2000]] system, with tapes that could be used on both sides and had 8 hours of total recording time. As Philips only sold its systems on the PAL standard and in Europe, and the Japanese makers sold globally, the scale advantages of the Japanese proved insurmountable and Philips withdrew the V2000 system and joined the VHS Coalition.{{citation}}

Philips had developed a [[laser disk]] early on for selling movies, but delayed its commercial launch for fear of cannibalizing its video recorder sales. Later Philips joined with MCA to launch the first commercial laser disk standard and players. In 1982, Philips teamed with Sony to launch the [[Compact Disc]]; this format evolved into the [[DVD]] and later [[Blu-ray]], which Philips launched with Sony in 1997{{citation}} and 2006 respectively.

In 1991, the company's name was changed from N.V. Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken to Philips Electronics N.V. At the same time, North American Philips was formally dissolved, and a new corporate division was formed in the U.S. with the name Philips Electronics North America Corp.{{citation}}

In 1997 the company officers decided to move the headquarters from Eindhoven to [[Amsterdam]] along with the corporate name change to [[Koninklijk]]e Philips Electronics N.V.{{citation}} The move was completed in 2001. Initially, the company was housed in the [[Rembrandt Tower]], but in 2002 they moved again, this time to the [[Breitner Tower]]. Philips Lighting, Philips Research, Philips Semiconductors (spun off as NXP in September 2006) and Philips Design, are still based in Eindhoven. Philips Healthcare is headquartered in both [[Best, Netherlands]] (just outside Eindhoven) and [[Andover, Massachusetts]], United States (near Boston).

===2001 to 2011===
[[File:Siege Philips Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|upright|The current Philips headquarters in Amsterdam, [[Netherlands]]]]
In 2004, Philips abandoned the slogan "Let's make things better" in favour of a new one: "Sense and simplicity".

In December 2005 Philips announced its intention to sell or demerge its semiconductor division. On 1 September 2006, it was announced in Berlin that the name of the new company formed by the division would be [[NXP Semiconductors]]. On 2 August 2006, Philips completed an agreement to sell a controlling 80.1% stake in NXP Semiconductors to a consortium of [[private equity]] investors consisting of [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.]] (KKR), [[Silver Lake Partners]] and [[AlpInvest Partners]]. On 21 August 2006, [[Bain Capital]] and [[Apax Partners]] announced that they had signed definitive commitments to join the acquiring consortium, a process which was completed on 1 October 2006.

The [[Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium|Philips physics laboratory]] has scaled down.  As of 2010, the company does not try to be innovative in consumer electronics through [[fundamental research]], but continues to improve its many consumer lifestyle products.<ref>NRC Handelsblad, 4 Sep 2010 ''Het nieuwe Philips wordt blij van een iPad-hoesje/The new Philips becomes happy from an iPad cover, Dutch original:" 'We zijn geen high-tech bedrijf meer, het gaat erom dat de technologie<U+00EB>n introduceren die breed gedragen worden door de consument', zegt Valk [..] Consumer Lifestyle is nu zodanig ingericht dat er geen jaren meer gewerkt wordt aan uitvindingen die weinig kans van slagen hebben. [..]De Philips staf windt er geen doekjes om dat het bedrijf niet altijd voorop loopt bij de technologische ontwikkelingen in consumentengoederen."</ref>

===2011 to present===
Due to the fact that net profit slumped 85 percent in Q3 2011, Philips has announced to cut 4,500 jobs to match part of an <U+20AC>800 million ($1.1 billion) cost-cutting scheme to boost profits and meet its financial target.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/oct/17/philips-cut-4500-jobs-profits |title=Philips to cut 4,500 jobs |date=17 October 2011}}</ref>

Philips has recently made gains in [[corporate social responsibility]]: in its 2012 report on progress relating to [[conflict minerals]], the [[Enough Project]] rated Philips the fourth highest of 24 consumer electronics companies.

In March 2012 Philips announced its intention to sell, or demerge its television manufacturing operations to TPV Technology.

In 2011, the company posted a loss of 1.3 billion euros, but earned a net profit in Q1 and Q2 2012, however the management want 1.1 billion euros cost-cutting which will be an increase from 800 million euros and may cut another 2,200 jobs until end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19554444 |title=Philips Electronics cuts another 2,200 jobs |date=September 11, 2012}}</ref>

Philips also forayed into the pharmaceuticals market in a company best known as Philips-Duphar (Dutch Pharmaceuticals). Philips-Duphar made products for crop protection, veterinary medicine and products for human use. Duphar was sold to [[Solvay (company)|Solvay]], now Solvay Pharmaceuticals. In subsequent years divisions have been sold of, by Solvay, to other companies (crop protection was sold to UniRoyal, now [[Chemtura Corporation|Chemtura]] and the veterinary division was sold to Fort Dodge, a division of [[Wyeth]]).
Philips also acquired Dynalite, an Australia based lighting control company in 2009, in order to provide its customer a complete lighting solution.

Its record division, [[PolyGram]], was sold to [[Seagram]] in 1998 and was merged into [[Universal Music Group]]. [[Philips Records]] continues to operate as part of UMG, its name licenced from its former parent.

===Green Initiatives===
Philips is running the EcoVision4 initiative in which it committed to a number of environmentally positive improvements by 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philips.com/sites/philipsglobal/about/sustainability/environmentalresponsibility/ecovision4program/index.page|title=Philips <U+2013> EcoVision4| publisher=Philips |accessdate=7 January 2011}}</ref>

Also Philips marks its "green" products with the Philips Green Logo, identifying them as products that have a significantly better environmental performance than their competitors or predecessors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philips.com/about/sustainability/ourgreenproducts/index.page |title=Philips <U+2013> Our Green Products| publisher=Philips |accessdate=7 January 2011}}</ref>

===L-Prize competition===
In 2011, Philips won a $10 million cash prize from the [[US Department of Energy]] for winning its [[L Prize|L-Prize]] competition, to produce a high-efficiency, long operating life replacement for a standard 60-W incandescent lightbulb.<ref name="L-prize">Margery Conner, EE Times. "[http://eetimes.com/electronics-news/4218485/-10M-L-Prize-goes-to-Philips-for-60W-replacement-LED-bulb $10M L Prize goes to Philips for 60W replacement LED bulb]." 3 August 2011. Retrieved 5 August 2011.</ref> The winning LED lightbulb, which was made available to consumers in April 2012, produces slightly more than 900 lumens at an input power of only 10 W.<ref name="philwin">{{cite web |url=http://www.lightingprize.org/philips-winner.stm |title= DOE Announces Philips as First Winner of the L Prize Competition |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60jS9wT6Q |archivedate=6 August 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref>

===Greenpeace ranking===
In [[Greenpeace]]'s 2012 Guide to Greener Electronics that ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, climate and energy and how green their products are, Philips ranks 10th place with a score of 3.8/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/ |title=Guide to Greener Electronics &#124; Greenpeace International |publisher=Greenpeace.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-24}}</ref> The company was the top scorer in the Energy section due to its energy advocacy work calling upon the EU to adopt a 30% reduction for greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. It is also praised for its new products which are free from [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] plastic and [[Brominated flame retardant|BFRs]]. However, the guide criticizes Phillips' sourcing of fibres for paper, arguing it must develop a paper procurement policy which excludes suppliers involved in deforestation and illegal logging.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/ |title=Guide to Greener Electronics <U+2013> Greenpeace International| publisher=Greenpeace International |accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref>

Philips have made some considerable progress since 2007 (when it was first ranked in this guide), in particular by supporting the Individual Producer Responsibility principle, which means that the company is accepting the responsibility for the toxic impacts of its products on e-waste dumps around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/companies/Philips/ |title=Philips Greenpeace International| publisher=Greenpeace International |accessdate=7 January 2011}}</ref>
