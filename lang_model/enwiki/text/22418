The '''A1500''' is an 'A' road entirely within the [[English county]] of [[Lincolnshire]]. It links the [[A156 road|A156]] at [[Marton, Lincolnshire|Marton]] with the [[A15 road (England)|A15]] south of [[RAF Scampton]] via [[Sturton by Stow]].<ref name=OS121>{{cite map |publisher=Ordnance survey of Great Britain |title=Lincoln & Newark-on-Trent |date=02/06/2011  |scale=1:50 000  |series=OS Landranger  |section=121 |edition=C3 |isbn=9780319229422}}</ref>

The A1500 follows the [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman road]] Till Bridge Lane and at the very end at Scampton, Horncastle Lane.
 
==Route==
The A1500 starts in the village of Marton, at SK840820, and  runs south of east along the Roman alignment.  The junction in the Village is actually a crossroads: The Roman alignment is maintained toward the west, crosses the [[River Trent]] to [[Littleborough, Nottinghamshire]], and can be intermittently discovered nearly to Bawtry.  (None of this is part of the A1500.)

The A1500 follows the Roman Road through [[Sturton by Stow]]  at SK890803, crosses the [[River Till]] by ''Till Bridge Farm'' at SK908797, until SK947784 near [[Scampton]] village.  From here the modern road deviates almost due east, and ends at SK973781, the junction with the modern A15, Roman Ermine street, south of RAF Scampton.

The whole length along the Roman Road is known as ''Till Bridge Lane''.  The section from the deviation at SK947784 to the roundabout on the A15 is named ''Horncastle Lane''.  The name Horncastle Lane continues on the other side of the A15, but that is a minor road not part of the A1500 designation.

The A1500 is single carriageway throughout.  

The Roman Road alignment from SK947784 near Scampton is maintained across fields, and also makes a junction with the A15 Ermine street at SK973774.  This is the main entrance to the [[Lincolnshire Showground]], which is based around the Roman Road.
