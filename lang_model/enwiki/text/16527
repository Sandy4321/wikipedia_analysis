'''Interstate 8''' (I-8) is an [[Interstate Highway]] in the southwestern [[United States]]. It runs from the southern edge of [[Mission Bay, San Diego, California|Mission Bay]] at Sunset Cliffs Blvd. in [[San Diego, California]], almost at the [[Pacific Ocean]], to the junction with [[Interstate 10]], just southeast of [[Casa Grande, Arizona]].<ref name="Google">{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=2863822521104466740,32.754740,-117.235610&saddr=I-8+E+%4032.754740,+-117.235610&daddr=32.820893,-111.690445&mra=mi&mrsp=1,0&sz=14&sll=32.812382,-111.692848&sspn=0.032606,0.05785&ie=UTF8&ll=32.87036,-114.345703&spn=4.17026,7.404785&z=7 |title=overview map of I-8 |accessdate=2008-02-15}}</ref> In California, especially from eastern [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]] to points east, Interstate 8 runs very close to the [[United States-Mexico border]].  At points in eastern [[Imperial County, California|Imperial County]], the border is no more than half a mile (1&nbsp;km) south of the Interstate.

I-8 at the Mountain Springs/In Ko Pah grade is routed down two separate canyons, as the freeway descends 4,000 vertical feet in 11 miles. This is one of the widest [[central reservation|medians]] on the entire Interstate Highway System. In places, the median is over {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} wide. I-8 also has the lowest above-ground elevation of any interstate at {{convert|52|ft|m}} below sea level near [[El Centro, California]]. (The lowest point on the entire [[interstate highway system]] is in the [[Fort McHenry Tunnel]] while crossing under the [[Inner Harbor]] of [[Baltimore, Maryland]] on [[I-95]].  The highway bottoms out at {{convert|-107|ft|m}}.)

Interstate 8 begins at the intersection of Sunset Cliffs Boulevard and Nimitz Boulevard. For its first few miles, it parallels the San Diego River Floodway east. Near Old Town, I-8 intersects with [[Interstate 5 (California)|Interstate 5]] as well as with the former [[State Route 209 (California)|State Route 209]]. I-8 continues eastward, bisecting the area known as "Hotel Circle." As I-8 enters Mission Valley, it has junctions with [[State Route 163 (California)|State Route 163]], [[Interstate 805]] ([[Jack Schrade Interchange]]), and [[Interstate 15 (California)|Interstate 15]] and its continuation, [[State Route 15 (California)|State Route 15]]. In [[La Mesa, California|La Mesa]], I-8 interchanges with [[State Route 125 (California)|State Route 125]]. I-8 continues into [[El Cajon, California|El Cajon]], where it intersects with [[State Route 67 (California)|State Route 67]] before it ascends into the mountains and the [[Cleveland National Forest]], traveling through towns such as [[Alpine, California|Alpine]] and [[Pine Valley, California|Pine Valley]]. I-8 intersects with [[State Route 79 (California)|State Route 79]] in the national forest before descending into the [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial Valley]] and passing through the [[La Posta Indian Reservation|La Posta]] and [[Campo Indian Reservation|Campo]] [[Indian reservation]]s. In [[Boulevard, California|Boulevard]], I-8 intersects with the eastern end of [[State Route 94 (California)|State Route 94]].<ref name="rmcn">{{Cite map | publisher=Rand McNally | title=The Road Atlas | year=2008 | page=15,17 }}</ref><ref name="tg">{{Cite map | publisher=Thomas Brothers | title=California Road Atlas and Driver's Guide | year=2000 | page=107,111,112,212,213,214,V}}</ref>

Interstate 8 straddles the San Diego-Imperial county line for a few miles before turning east. While going over the mountain pass into the Imperial Valley, I-8's roadways are separated by a considerable distance. This is because the eastbound lanes traverse the pass on the former roadbed of US-80. The westbound lanes were placed on a different routing. In the Imperial Valley, I-8 intersects with [[State Route 98 (California)|State Route 98]], a highway leading to [[Calexico, California|Calexico]]. I-8 then goes through [[Coyote Wells, California|Coyote Wells]] before entering the city of [[El Centro, California|El Centro]] several miles later. In El Centro, I-8 intersects with [[State Route 86 (California)|State Route 86]] and [[State Route 111 (California)|State Route 111]], both north<U+2013>south routes which connect to [[Interstate 10 (California)|Interstate 10]] in the [[Coachella Valley]] (north of the [[Salton Sea]]), before [[State Route 115 (California)|State Route 115]] and [[State Route 98 (California)|State Route 98]] merge with I-8. The freeway then traverses the [[Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area]] and intersects with [[State Route 186 (California)|State Route 186]] leading to [[Mexico]]. Interstate 8 then passes through [[Felicity, California]] and [[Winterhaven, California|Winterhaven]] before crossing the [[Colorado River]] into [[Yuma, Arizona]]<ref name="rmcn" /><ref name="tg" /> on a bridge built in 1978.<ref name="cah">[http://www.cahighways.org/001-008.html#008 California Highways]</ref>

===Arizona===
I-8 enters Arizona from California at the [[Colorado River]] bridge at Yuma. Heading westbound out of Arizona, the highway continues on to [[San Diego, California|San Diego]]. It initially heads south through Yuma until the interchange with US 95 where the freeway begins to makes the turn to the east.  I-8 closely follows the alignment of the old US 80 route and in some locations, the US 80 alignment was upgraded and became I-8.  West of [[Wellton, Arizona|Wellton]], the highway curves towards the north to take a northeasterly course.  Through this part of Arizona, I-8 passes along the northern edge of the [[Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range]] and to the south of the [[Yuma Proving Ground]].  It keeps a northeastern heading until it reaches [[Gila Bend, Arizona]] where it intersects [[Arizona State Route 85|SR 85]] which leads to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].  After leaving Gila Bend, I-8 takes a southeastern heading as it passes through the [[Sonoran Desert National Monument]].  After exiting the monument, the highway continues on an easterly heading to a junction with [[Arizona State Route 84|SR 84]] that will parallel I-8 to the north and go through [[Casa Grande, Arizona|Casa Grande]] while I-8 will pass to the south of the city.  I-8 reaches its eastern terminus at an interchange with [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|I-10]] which continues on to [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]].<ref name="ADOT Highway Log"/><ref>{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=12292208217460437544,32.728310,-114.617480%3B401209425362210788,32.817011,-111.683029&saddr=I-8+E+%4032.728310,+-114.617480&daddr=Exit+178A+%4032.817011,+-111.683029&doflg=ptm&sll=32.795685,-113.150255&sspn=3.181171,5.119629&ie=UTF8&z=8 |title=overview map of I-8 in Arizona |accessdate=2008-04-11}}</ref>

==History==
I-8 was part of the original 1957 plan of Interstates, following [[U.S. Route 80|US-80]] from San Diego to [[Gila Bend, Arizona]], then [[Arizona State Route 84|AZ-84]] from there to Casa Grande.

===California===
Interstate 8 replaced California's section of [[U.S. Route 80 (California)|U.S. Route 80]], which had existed from around 1929 until 1964. The original designations of US-80 in California were as LRN 12 (since 1909) from San Diego to El Centro, and as LRN 27 (since 1915) from El Centro to Arizona. I-8 was accepted as a [[Interstate Highway System#Chargeable and non-chargeable Interstate routes|chargeable interstate]] in 1957,<ref name="cah" /> and was signed as Interstate 8 in 1964.<ref name="gbc">[http://www.gbcnet.com/ushighways/history/1964_hwy_renumbering_contents.html 1964 California Highway Renumbering]</ref> The "Ocean Beach Freeway" section west of I-5 was completed by 1967<ref name="wcr">[http://www.westcoastroads.com/california/i-008_ca.html WestCoastRoads]</ref> as LRN 286 and was later designated as SR 109; it was later added to Interstate 8 in 1972.<ref name="cah" />

With the coming of the Interstate Highways, the corridor was to be upgraded to Interstate standards.  By 1963, this process was in progress with portions of the highway between [[Mohawk, Arizona|Mohawk]] and Gila Bend, and between Gila Bend and [[Stanfield, Arizona|Stanfield]] having been upgraded.<ref name="1963 map">{{cite map|url=http://www.rockymountainroads.com/maps/1963-az.html|title=Road Map of Arizona|year=1963|publisher=[[Rand McNally]]|accessdate=2008-05-04}}</ref>  By 1971, I-8 was nearly complete including a new alignment east of Yuma built parallel and to the south of the original US 80 alignment.  A new alignment was also built to the south of the SR 84 alignment at the eastern end of the highway from southwest of Stanfield to the eastern terminus at I-10 southeast of Casa Grande.  The only portions of I-8 not completed at this time were the Casa Grande bypass and the western end near Yuma.<ref name="1971 map">{{cite map|url=http://www.rockymountainroads.com/maps/1971-az.html|title=Road Map of Arizona|year=1971|publisher=Arizona Highway Department|accessdate=2008-05-04}}</ref>  As the Interstate was completed, the highways that it replaced were removed from the state highway system.  In 1973, the SR 84 designation was removed from the highway from Gila Bend to the split where I-8 followed a new alignment southwest of Stanfield.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Arizona Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=2008-05-04|url=http://www.azhighwaydata.com/resolutions/?resnum=1973-%20-075|title=ADOT Right-of-Way Resolution 1973-20-075}}</ref>  In 1977, the US 80 designation was removed from this stretch in favor of I-8.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Arizona Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=2008-05-04|url=http://www.azhighwaydata.com/resolutions/?resnum=1977-16-A-048|title=ADOT Right-of-Way Resolution 1977-16-A-048}}</ref>

==El Centro business loop==
{{Infobox road small

|location=[[El Centro, California]]
}}
Business Loop Interstate 8 is a business loop route that diverges from [[Interstate 8 (California)|Interstate 8]] in [[El Centro, California]] to pass through the downtown area.  Business Interstate 8 originates and terminates with I-8 and acts as a direct link to El Centro as I-8 bypasses the downtown area.

Business Interstate 8's path through El Centro traces roughly three sides of a rectangle with I-8 constituting the fourth side. Bus-8 begins at its western terminus with I-8 by going north along Imperial Avenue. When Bus-8 reaches the intersection of Adams Avenue it turns east along that road. Along this stretch Bus-8 is joined by [[California State Route 86|State Route 86]] which approaches from the north along Imperial Ave, and by [[Imperial County Route S80]] which approaches from the west along Adams Ave. The three routes continue joined as Adams Ave ends and turns south along Fourth Ave where S80 then turns to continue east. Bus-8 and SR 86 continue south running concurrent until Bus-8 reaches its eastern terminus with I-8.

The Imperial Ave section of Bus-8 is city maintained by El Centro, the rest of Bus-8 is state maintained due to its concurrency with SR 86.

Along its concurrency with SR 86, Bus-8 is part of the [[Juan Bautista De Anza National Historic Trail]].
