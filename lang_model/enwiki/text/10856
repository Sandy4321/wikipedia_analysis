'''Antoine de F<U+00E9>vin''' (c.[[1470]] &ndash; late [[1511]] or early [[1512]]) was a [[France|French]] composer of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]].  He was active at the same time as [[Josquin Desprez]], and shares many traits with his more famous contemporary.

==Life==

F<U+00E9>vin was most likely born in [[Arras]], the son of an alderman.  His brother [[Robert de F<U+00E9>vin]] was also a composer.  Most likely Antoine left Arras in the late [[1480s]], though there is no evidence that he went to Italy, the commonest destination for Franco-Flemish composers of the time.  Sometime during the [[1490s]] it is likely he became a priest (although there is no known documenation of that today), and he also may have obtained a master's degree at a university, since he is commonly known as ''maistre'' later in his life.  By [[1507]] he was working as a singer and composer for [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] of France, who praised him highly.  He died at [[Blois]].

The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[music theory|music theorist]] and biographer [[Heinrich Glarean]], writing in [[1547]], noted that F<U+00E9>vin was a follower of Josquin, and that he died young; he also mentioned him as being a composer of Orleans, though this most likely referred to the association of that city with the court of Louis XII.

==Works==

All of F<U+00E9>vin's surviving music is vocal.  He wrote [[mass (music)|masses]], [[motet]]s and [[chanson]]s.  Stylistically his music is similar to Josquin's in its clarity of texture and design, and its relatively progressive nature:  F<U+00E9>vin evidently wrote in the most current styles, adopting the method of contrasting [[imitation (music)|imitative]] sections with [[homophony|homophonic]] sections which came into prominence around [[1490]].  Unlike Josquin, he was less concerned with the careful setting of text than with formal structure; his setting of individual words is occasionally clumsy, though his larger-scale structures are easy to follow.  He also particularly liked the device of using vocal duets to contrast with the full sonority of the choir.

Some of F<U+00E9>vin's music uses the technique of free [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] fantasy, later perfected by Josquin, where strict imitation is absent;  fragments of a [[cantus firmus]] pervade the texture, giving a feeling of overall unity and complete equality of all the voices.

Of his music, 14 masses, 3 [[lamentation (music)|lamentations]], 3 [[magnificat]]s, 14 motets and 17 chansons survive.
