'''''Weather Machine''''' is a [[Lumino kinetic art|lumino-kinetic]] [[bronze sculpture]] and columnar machine that serves as a [[weather beacon]], displaying a [[Weather forecasting|weather prediction]] each day at noon. Designed and constructed by Omen Design Group Inc., the approximately {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on|sigfig=1}} tall sculpture was installed in 1988 in the northwest corner of [[Pioneer Courthouse Square]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], in the United States. Two thousand people attended its dedication, which was broadcast live nationally from the square by ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' weatherman [[Willard Scott]]. The machine cost $60,000.

During its daily two-minute sequence, which includes a trumpet [[fanfare]], mist and flashing lights, the machine displays one of three metal symbols as a prediction of the weather for the following 24-hour period: a sun for clear and sunny weather, a [[Great Blue Heron|blue heron]] for [[drizzle]] and transitional weather, or a [[dragon]] and mist for rainy or stormy weather. The sculpture includes two [[bronze]] [[Anemometer|wind scoops]] and displays the temperature via vertical colored lights along its stem. The [[air quality index]] is also displayed by a light system below the [[stainless steel]] globe. Weather predictions are made based on information obtained by employees of Pioneer Courthouse Square from the [[National Weather Service]] and the Department of Environmental Quality. Considered a tourist attraction, ''Weather Machine'' has been called "bizarre",<ref name=Carlin>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/23/travel/what-s-doing-in-portland-ore.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|title=What's Doing In: Portland, Ore.|accessdate=May 9, 2013|date=April 23, 1989|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Peter|last=Carlin|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|issn=0362-4331|oclc=1645522}}</ref> "playful",<ref name=Rotarian>{{Cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QDIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=May 1990|work=The Rotarian|title=Pioneer Courthouse Square|pages=26<U+2013>27|publisher=Rotary International|volume=156|issn=0035-838X|issue=5}}</ref> "unique"<ref name=Hunt>{{Cite news|title=Downtown Portland Public Art|date=April 12, 1991|first=Phil|last=Hunt|work=[[The Oregonian]]|page=R26|location=Portland, Oregon|issn=8750-1317}}</ref> and "wacky",<ref name=McInerny>{{Cite news|title=63-Year-Old Local Scribe Rises From Bedridden, Troubled Youth to Dance Literary Waltz of Words|date=October 16, 1988|first=Vivian|last=McInerny|work=The Oregonian|location=Portland, Oregon|page=L01}}</ref> and has been compared to a giant [[Sceptre|scepter]].

The machine, whose height is reported to be between {{convert|25|and|33|ft|m}},<ref name=Carlin/><ref name=Rotarian/><ref name=Garcia/> includes two bronze [[Anemometer|wind scoops]] that turn in opposite directions.<ref name=Bella/><ref name=Garcia/> It also indicates the temperature (when 20 [[Fahrenheit|<U+00B0>F]] or above)<ref name=Richard/> via vertical colored lights along the sculpture's stem.<ref name=Hortsch/><ref name=Garcia/><ref name=PPR/> Measured by an internal gauge, the machine displays blue lights for below freezing, white lights for above freezing and red lights to mark every ten degrees (<U+00B0>F).<ref name=Garcia/> Referring to an additional light system (below the [[stainless steel]] globe) that indicates air quality, ''The Oregonian'' reported in 1988 that a green light indicates good air quality, amber reflects "semismoggy"<ref name=Bella/> air and a red light indicates poor air quality.<ref name=Garcia/> However, in 1998 one writer for ''The Oregonian'' warned: "you don't want to breathe so much when the white light is on".<ref name=Hortsch/> Pioneer Courthouse Square employees enter air quality information into the machine's computer following routine checks with the Department of Environmental Quality.<ref name=Garcia/>

In addition to its pre-dawn national dedication on television, ''Weather Machine'' had a public dedication at noon on August 24, attended by Mayor [[Bud Clark]] and other city officials.<ref name=Scott/><ref name=Sunshine/> On that day, the machine displayed the sun symbol and a green light for good air quality, and indicated a temperature of {{convert|82|F|C|0}}. Following the fanfare, known officially as "Fanfare for Weather Machine with Four Trumpets", jazz singer Shirley Nanette led the crowd in a rendition of "[[You Are My Sunshine]]".<ref name=Sunshine/> Portland had good weather in the days following its dedication, preventing visitors from seeing all three symbols for an extended length of time (though all three symbols are displayed briefly during the daily two-minute sequence). This prompted the executive director of Pioneer Courthouse Square to consider altering the machine's schedule so that the public would have a chance to see all three symbols.<ref name=Garcia/> The sculpture maintained good health until winter 1995, when its mechanical performance temporarily began deviating from noon and the temperature gauge had difficulties working properly.<ref name=Under>{{Cite news|title=Under the Weather|date=December 1, 1995|page=C01|work=The Oregonian|location=Portland, Oregon}}</ref> In 2012, the machine stopped operating for about one week due to a malfunction.<ref name=Saker/>

In the weeks following ''Weather Machine''{{'s}} dedication, an estimated 300 to 400 people gathered at the square daily to witness the noon sequence.<ref name=Garcia/> Following the dedication, ''The Oregonian'' published: "It takes nothing from its fascination to know that a human on the staff of the square will be making the daily phone calls to the Weather Service and the Department of Environmental Quality, and pushing the necessary buttons to cue the pillar's performance&nbsp;... They have given Portland an attraction no other city has. We're going to like it."<ref name=Sunshine/>

Ponzi described the machine as "light-hearted&nbsp;... active, distinctive <U+2013> and fun".<ref name=Bella/> O'Donnell, who inspired the sculpture, called it a "gentle spectacle" and described the work as "a cartoon contraption, an odd little thingamajig. It has bells and whistles and other mechanized wonders that confirm rain sometime after the downpour and proudly announce sunshine in the bright light of day."<ref name=TO/> In 1994, ''The Oregonian'' reported that O'Donnell regarded ''Weather Machine'' with a "mixture of wonder and embarrassment" and stated that he "[didn't] think it's all that attractive".<ref name=Nokes>{{Cite news|title=Are We All Wet?|date=March 3, 1994|first=R. Gregory|last=Nokes|work=The Oregonian|page=D01|location=Portland, Oregon}}</ref> The publication's Vivian McInerny said of O'Donnell and the machine: "Practical people may wonder why the square needs such a silly weather machine when a glance out the window works as well&nbsp;... And these practical people may be the very ones who make the world go 'round. But it is the less practical people, the dreamers like O'Donnell, who make it worth going 'round."<ref name=McInerny/><ref name=TO/>

In 1995, ''The Oregonian''{{'s}} Jonathan Nicholas wrote: "To this day, nobody is exactly sure what happens when the thing sounds off each day at noon. It's like having a governor in blue jeans. We can't really explain it: It just happens."<ref name=Ponzi/> Grant Butler of ''The Oregonian'' gave the machine's trumpet fanfare as one of three examples ways in which people could be certain it was noon in Portland.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Dining Cheap Eats Saigon Kitchen Cart|date=June 28, 2002|first=Grant|last=Butler|work=The Oregonian|page=17|location=Portland, Oregon}}</ref>
