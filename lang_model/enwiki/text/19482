'''Ho Yinsen''' is a [[fiction]]al [[supporting character]] of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Iron Man]] (Tony Stark), who is key to Iron Man's [[origin story]] and was a [[mentor]] to the younger man.

The character has appeared in nearly all Iron Man [[continuity (fiction)|continuities]], though sometimes with a slightly different name; among the alternate names are '''Yinsen''' (with no [[first name]] given), '''Gia-Bao Yinsen''', '''Ho Yen''', and '''Wellington Yinsen'''.

Actor [[Shaun Toub]] portrayed Yinsen's character in the 2008 superhero film, ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]''.

==Fictional character history==
===Original character history===
Ho Yinsen was a [[pacifist]]ic [[physicist]], [[engineer]], and [[professor]] from the fictional city of Timbetpal;<ref>The name is similar to Dingbeibao ({{zh-cp|c=<U+5B9A><U+5317><U+5821>|p=D<U+00EC>ngb<U+011B>ib<U+01CE>o}}), a fictional place name in Chinese, modelled after the name of Zhengbeibao ({{zh-cp|c=<U+9547><U+5317><U+5821>|p=Zh<U+00E8>ngb<U+011B>ib<U+01CE>o}}), in [[Ningxia]]. Both names mean "Fortress of Pacifying the North".</ref> while Tony Stark was in [[college]], Stark had greatly admired the older man's work. In his old age, Yinsen is captured in [[Vietnam]] by the [[Communist]] [[warlord]] [[Wong-Chu]] before [[United States|American]] [[arms manufacturer]] and engineer [[Tony Stark]] is also captured. Stark had tripped a [[land mine]] and been injured with [[shrapnel]] that was slowly moving toward his [[heart]]. Yinsen builds a [[magnetism|magnetic]] chest plate and affixes it to Stark's chest, thus preventing the shrapnel from reaching Stark's heart, thereby saving Stark's life and keeping him alive. Wong-Chu then orders Yinsen and Stark to build [[weapon]]s for him. Instead, Yinsen helps Stark secretly build the first [[Iron Man armor]], which includes a device for Stark's heart to keep him alive. Yinsen sacrifices his life distracting Wong-Chu in order to buy time for Stark to power up his armor. Stark dons the armor, becoming [[Iron Man]]; defeats Wong-Chu, apparently killing him in the explosion of a munitions shed; and frees all of Wong-Chu's prisoners.<ref>''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #39 (March 1963).</ref>

Twelve of Wong-Chu's former prisoners were disciples of Yinsen; one of these disciples, Sun-Tao, leads them to establish a quasi-religious [[cult]] called the '''Sons of Yinsen'''. The Sons of Yinsen develop very advanced technology from notes in Yinsen's journal that he had written before his death; they use this technology to create the apparent [[utopia]] of New Timbetpal and to create a separate floating, ambulatory, usually-[[cloaking device|cloaked]] city in the sky. It is revealed that Wong-Chu survived the munitions shed explosion and that Yinsen's [[brain]] was preserved alive, [[salvage]]d by an interdimensional merchant called [[Doctor Midas]]. Doctor Midas sold Yinsen's brain in an [[auction]] to Wong-Chu. Iron Man helps the Sons of Yinsen defeat Wong-Chu, who is [[decapitation|beheaded]] by one of the Sons of Yinsen, and recover Yinsen's brain.<ref>''[[Invincible Iron Man]]'' vol. 3 #31-32 (August-September 2000) and ''Invincible Iron Man Annual'' 2000.</ref>

The Sons of Yinsen attempt to [[resurrection|resurrect]] Ho Yinsen by placing his brain inside a [[sentient]] Iron Man armor, which, unknown to them, is actually under [[Ultron]]'s control. Falsely believing Ultron to be a resurrected Ho Yinsen, the Sons of Yinsen follow his directives toward planning for a war; only Sun-Tao refuses to obey, for which he is displaced as leader of the Sons of Yinsen by a man named Tyger Minn. Ultron leads the Sons of Yinsen to reveal themselves to the public and establish the '''Church of Yinsen'''. Sun-Tao recovers Yinsen's brain, and then Iron Man, Sun-Tao, and [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]] work together to defeat Ultron and the Sons of Yinsen and free Ultron's prisoner [[Antigone (comics)|Antigone]]. Ultron attempts to blow up the floating city of the Sons of Yinsen to kill all of them as well as Iron Man; however, the sentient armor has apprently absorbed enough of the thoughts of Yinsen that part of it acts to save Iron Man and Sun-Tao from the destruction of the city.<ref>''[[Invincible Iron Man]]'' vol. 3 #46-48 (November 2001-January 2002).</ref>

===Character history after the Afghanistan retcon===

In the "Execute Program" [[story arc]] of ''Invincible Iron Man'' vol. 4, a [[retcon]] establishes that Tony Stark and Ho Yinsen had been captured not by Communists in Vietnam, but rather by the [[Taliban]] in [[Afghanistan]], and that Ho Yinsen was murdered under orders from five [[terrorist]]s named Dennis Kellard, Ara Tanzerian, Zakim Karzai, Aftaab Lemar, and Kareem Mahwash Najeeb. Before he died, Yinsen had been coerced into implanting a "bio-magnetic receiving unit" inside Stark's brain. In a failed attempt to recover the device, the terrorists send a [[hitman]] named Andrei Gorlovich after Yinsen's family; Gorlovich murders Yinsen's wife.<ref name="ExecuteProgram">''[[Invincible Iron Man]]'' vol. 4 #7-12 (June-November 2006).</ref>

Years later, some of the five terrorists have become [[diplomat]]s. Yinsen's grieving teenage son (whose name is never revealed), blaming Stark for the deaths of his parents, takes control of the device in Stark's brain and uses it to [[mind-control]] him into [[assassination|assassinating]] all five of the former terrorists. Thus framed for the assassinations, when Stark, in order to try to prove his innocence, confronts Yinsen's son, Yinsen's son is shot and killed with a [[sniper rifle]] by a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent acting by order of [[Nick Fury]].<ref name="ExecuteProgram"/>

==Other versions==

===Marvel Adventures===

In the [[Marvel Adventures]] continuity, '''Gia-Bao Yinsen''' was a [[pacifist]]ic [[inventor]] and [[professor]] from the fictional city of [[Madripoor]] who criticizes Tony Stark for allowing weapons Stark designed to fall into the hands of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] (A.I.M.), who are using the weapons to attack Madripoor. While flying an experimental plane, Stark is brought down and captured by A.I.M., who also is holding Yinsen prisoner. Using the wreckage from Stark's plane, Stark and Yinsen work together to design a pair of Iron Man armors, one gold and the other red, which both don. Yinsen is killed during their escape from A.I.M.<ref>''Marvel Adventures Iron Man'' #1 (July 2007).</ref>

===In cartoons===
[[Image:03 Wellington Yinsen The Origin of Iron Man.jpg|thumb|right|Yinsen on the 1994 ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' animated series.]]
In the 1994 [[cartoon]] [[television series]] ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'', the name of the character is changed to '''Wellington Yinsen''', and he is voiced by [[voice actor]] [[Neil Ross]]. He works with Arnold Rock before Arnold becomes the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]. The Mandarin later captures Wellington Yinsen to use him to help Tony Stark build an invincible armor for his minions. When Tony Stark becomes Iron Man for the first time, he manages to escape, but Yinsen is killed by the Mandarin.

In the 2007 [[straight-to-DVD]] animated film ''[[The Invincible Iron Man]]'', the name of the character is changed to '''Ho Yen'''; in addition to the scientific background of the original version, Ho Yen also has knowledge of the [[mysticism|mystic arts]], especially the legend of [[Mandarin (comics)#Film|The Mandarin]] which plays a crucial role in the film. He, [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]] and Tony Stark are captured by a terrorist named Wong-Chu in [[China]] rather than in Vietnam. Otherwise, his role in the story is almost identical to the original version. Ho Yen is shot in the head and killed by Wong-Chu.

===In live-action film===

In the 2008 film ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'', '''Yinsen''' (his [[first name]] is never given in the film) is portrayed by actor [[Shaun Toub]]. In the film, he is a doctor and engineer from a small fictional village in [[Afghanistan]] called Gulmira and is captured by the local branch of an international [[terrorist]] group called "[[Mandarin (comics)#Film|The Ten Rings]]" sometime before the film. Yinsen meets Tony Stark when he too is kidnapped by the group.  Yinsen constructs a makeshift electromagnet, powered by a car battery, which he implants into Stark's chest as a way to prevent shrapnel, lodged into Tony's chest during his kidnapping, from entering his [[heart]] and killing him. Under captivity, Stark and Yinsen are ordered by the terrorists to build a missile similar to the kind Stark was demonstrating to the US military or they will be killed. However, both men know that they will be murdered either way and plan an escape instead.

Yinsen assists Stark in secretly creating his prototype Iron Man armor as a means of escape and also helps Stark to build a prototype power source for the electromagnet that is more powerful and compact. While working together the two men bond. Yinsen notes that he and Tony actually met briefly at a conference in [[Bern]], though he understands that Stark doesn't remember as he was so drunk. When Tony asks about Yinsen's family, Yinsen merely notes, "I will see them when I leave this place." Yinsen also points out the damage wreaked upon the region by the terrorists, using Stark's own weapons, and asks if this is what he wishes "the legacy of the great Tony Stark" to be. 

When the armor is finally completed, Yinsen helps Tony into the suit and preps it for activation. However, when the terrorists get wind of their plan, Yinsen realizes that they need more time for the suit's software to fully load. In order to buy Stark extra time, Yinsen grabs an [[assault rifle]] and chases the terrorists away from their workshop but quickly finds himself surrounded and out-gunned. When the suit is fully powered up, Stark easily fights his way through the cave, but finds a gravely wounded Yinsen lying near the entrance. With his dying breath Yinsen explains to Stark that his family had already died and that he is now going to meet them. When Tony thanks him for saving his life, Yinsen tells Stark "Don't waste your life." He dies immediately after, and an enraged Stark destroys the terrorist camp and their stockpile of Stark Industries weapons before escaping. 

Like the comics, Stark's experience in captivity along with Yinsen's sacrifice force him to reevaluate his moral stance. Later in the film, when Stark sees a news report detailing the Ten Rings's raid of Gulmira, Yinsen's village, Stark dons the completed version of his Iron Man armor for the first time and drives them out.
