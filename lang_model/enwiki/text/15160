'''Emil Lawrence Sodersten''' (30 August 1899 - 14 December 1961) was an [[Australian]] [[architect]] active in the second quarter of the [[20th Century]]. His work encompassed the [[Australian architectural styles]] of [[Australian non-residential architectural styles|Art Deco]] and [[Australian non-residential architectural styles|Functionalist & Moderne]]. His deign for the [[Australian War Memorial]] was "the first national architectural monument in Australia". <ref>[http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A160337b.htm Australian Dictionary of Biography - Sodersten, Emil Lawrence (1899 - 1961]</ref> The [[Australian Institute of Architects]] presents the Emil Sodersten Interior Architecture Award annually in his honour. <ref>[http://www.archmedia.com.au/aa/aaissue.php?article=16&issueid=200711&typeon=2 Architecture Australia]</ref>

==Family==
Sodersten was born in the inner-[[Sydney]] suburb of [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]], the second of seven children born to Julia (n<U+00E9>e Dolleen) and Emil Sodersteen. Emil Junior and his brothers, Erik and Karl, later changed their [[surname]]s by [[deed poll]] to Sodersten.

==Education==
In 1915 Sodersten was [[Articled clerk|articled]] in architecture to Ross & Rowe and in the ensuing five years studied at [[Sydney Technical College]]. During 1921 he attended lectures at the [[University of Sydney]] given by the new Dean of Architecture, [[Wilkinson Award|Leslie Wilkinson]].

==Architectural career==
The [[Queensland]] firm Hall & Prentice were commissioned to design [[Brisbane City Hall]] in the early 1920s and Sodersten worked on the project with [[Bruce Dellit]] and [[Peter Kaad]]. He returned to Sydney in 1923 and was registered as an architect whilst working for John P. Tate & Young. Two years later Sodersten went into private practice. In 1927-28 he became a council-member of the Institute of Architects of New South Wales and was made a fellow of the [[Royal Australian Institute of Architects]] in 1931. He entered the  international competition to design the [[Australian War Memorial]] in [[Canberra]]. His design was considered exceptional but, as with most of those entered, was over budget. The only entry within budget was by John Crust and so the two architects were commissioned to work together on an amended design. Crust project managed the new building to Sodersten's even more monumental design. After conflict arose with Crust, Sodersteen withdrew in 1938. In Sydney he designed numerous apartment blocks, including Birtley Towers at Elizabeth Bay, and office buildings, including the City Mutual Life Assurance Society.  During the 1930s he worked in association with his brothers Erik Sodersten, an architect, and Karl Sodersten, a structural engineer. When Emil visited [[Europe]] in 1935 he was impressed with the work of [[Willem Marinus Dudok]] and [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage]] and from then on worked in the [[Functionalism (architecture)|fuctionalist style]]. In the late 1930s Nesca House, Newcastle was his major project.

==War Service==
During [[World War II]], Sodersten served with the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] in [[Papua and New Guinea]] and Queensland as a [[flight lieutenant]]. <ref>[http://cas.awm.gov.au/photograph/P05077.001 Australian War Memorial Record]</ref>

==Later life==
Sodersten married a 37-year-old secretary, Elsie Vera Wynn, in the [[Catholic Church]] in 1951. After World War II he rarely designed any new buildings. In 1951, he designed a Canberra chancellery and residence for the [[High Commissioner]] of Pakistan but the project remains unbuilt. He died of a [[coronary occlusion]] at home in [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]] and was survived by his wife.
