'''Lincolnshire''' is an affluent [[United States|American]] village in [[Vernon Township, Lake County, Illinois|Vernon Township]], a southern [[Lake County, Illinois|Lake County]], [[Illinois]] locale, and is a suburb of [[Chicago]], which is located in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] just to the south. The population was 6,108 at the 2000 census, the ethnicity of village inhabitants largely Caucasian. Lincolnshire was incorporated on [[August 5]], [[1957]] from land in the unincorporated [[Half Day, Illinois|Half Day]] area when land was purchased to build a residential subdivision, and underwent an aggressive era of expansion from 1983 to the 1990s. The [[Des Plaines River]] splits the village in half; geographically, it is halved again by a major traffic artery at its border that it shares with neighboring [[Vernon Hills, Illinois|Vernon Hills]]. It also experiences a humid temperate climate similar to most other communities within miles of the [[Great Lakes]].

Lincolnshire is home to [[Stevenson High School (Lincolnshire, Illinois)|Adlai E. Stevenson High School]] and is the home for the entirety of the elementary [[Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103]], two districts that are academically advanced in comparison to the majority of American schools. It is the headquarters of a variety of corporations including global [[outsourcing]] company [[Hewitt Associates]], and is the base of operations for the [[Newman-Haas Racing]] team. The village of Lincolnshire holds several festivals (including one mirroring the [[Taste of Chicago]]) annually in either commercial establishments such as City Park and the Village Green, or in one of the nine public parks and nature reserves that it has set up for recreation purposes; many of these parks contain tennis courts and other sports facilities. Lincolnshire also maintains a police department that works closely with the local school districts. It is also maintained by a public works system that incorporates public services and storm drain networks, both at the direct expense of the village. Lincolnshire retrieves all of its water from the city of [[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]], which lies on the coast of Lake Michigan. The village is governed by a [[Council-manager government]], and is a [[Home rule]] municipality. The mayor of the village is Brett Blomberg.

==History==
===Early History===

The first inhabitants of what would become the village of Lincolnshire were Native American [[Potawatomi]] migrants from Canada and Wisconsin who left in the sixteenth century searching for a warmer, more temperate climate.<ref name=Bookypoo1 /> These native American bands dominated present-day [[Lake County, Illinois|Lake County]] by 1768.<ref name=Bookypoo1 /> The first non-Native Americans to arrive in Lake County were the French [[Jesuit]] explorers Father [[Jacques Marquette]] and [[Louis Jolliet]], who, shortly after arriving at what is now [[Waukegan, Illinois|Waukegan]] in 1673,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A9565635|title=Waukegan, Illinois, USA|accessdate=2008-10-25 |work=BBCOnline|publisher=''[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]''|date=2006}}</ref> sailed down the [[Des Plaines River]] and made contact with the local Potawatomi in the area.<ref name=Bookypoo1>{{cite book|last = Dretske|first = Diana|authorlink = Diana Dretske |title = Lake County, Illinois: An Illustrated History|publisher = Heritage Media Corporation|date = May 2002|location = Dallas, TX|pages =16|isbn = 1886483612}}</ref> One of the Potawatomi villages that they encountered stretched along the west bank of the Des Plaines River, from present-day [[Illinois Route 22]] south to present-day Aptakisic Road, the first real settlement in the Lincolnshire and Half Day region. A "Council Tree" (actually a group of three trees) was located on the east side of the Des Plaines River just south of present-day Illinois Route&nbsp;22. The leaders of most of the Aptakisic tribes in the Midwest met under the "Council Tree" every two years to settle any differences and issues among them.<ref name=history1 /><ref name=history2 />

The Lincolnshire area was originally a part of the town of [[Half Day, Illinois|Half Day]], the first region settled by non-Native American peoples in present-day Lake County.<ref name="reichelt">{{cite book | last = Reichelt | first = Marie Ward | authorlink = Marie Ward Reichelt | title = History of Deerfield | publisher = Glenview Press | year = 1928}}</ref> Many people mistakenly believe that it was named Half Day because it was a half day's journey from [[Chicago]] on the way to [[Milwaukee]]. In reality, at the time a trip from Chicago to the area would have taken much longer. The area was actually named after Potawatomie Chief Halfda, the chief at the time the area was settled. A [[cartographer]] spelled it "Half Day", and the misnomer stuck, giving rise to the reputed, but erroneous, derivation of the name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dupagehistory.org/dupage_roots/Chapter2.htm|title=''DuPage Roots''|accessdate=2008-09-11 |author=Richard A. Thompson|date=1985|work=History of DuPage County|publisher=County of DuPage, Illinois}}</ref><ref> "Early Chicago", based off of ''A Compendium of the Early History of Chicago to the Year 1835, When the Indians Left'' (2000). [http://www.earlychicago.com/encyclopedia.php?letter=H]</ref><ref name=halfda /> The first European settler in the Lincolnshire area was Captain Daniel Wright, who arrived in 1834. Chief Halfda allowed Wright to build his cabin at the south end of the Potawatomi village at the site of the intersection of present-day [[Milwaukee Avenue]] and Aptakisic Road. The Potawatomi tribesmen were ousted a year later in the [[Treaty of Chicago|1833 Treaty of Chicago]], which was implemented two years after its conception, and faced relocation.<ref>{{cite book|last = Dretske|first = Diana|authorlink = Diana Dretske |title = Lake County, Illinois: An Illustrated History|publisher = Heritage Media Corporation|date = May 2002|location = Dallas, TX|pages =16<U+2013>17|isbn = 1886483612}}</ref>

The Half Day area experienced an economic boom with the arrival of a number of new settlers within the two decades following Wright's arrival. Among these pioneers were Seth Washburn, the first [[postmaster]] of the [[Vernon Township, Lake County, Illinois|Vernon Township]] who would settle in what is now the location of School District 103's Half Day Intermediate School, and Laura Sprague, the first teacher to reside in the area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vernontownship.com/history.html|title=History|accessdate=2008-09-13 |work=Township of Vernon, Lake County, Illinois|publisher=County of Lake, Illinois|date=2008}}</ref> By 1855, twenty-one years since the settling of the Half Day area by Wright, the town was a thriving community with a [[blacksmith]]'s shop, [[sawmill]], country store, and a church. At this time, the [[Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad]] connected Milwaukee to the county seat of [[Waukegan, Illinois|Waukegan]], and would expand throughout the Lake County area over the course of the next few decades; this also contributed to the town's temporal prosperity.<ref>{{cite book|last = Dretske|first = Diana|authorlink = Diana Dretske |title = Lake County, Illinois: An Illustrated History|publisher = Heritage Media Corporation|date = May 2002|location = Dallas, TX|pages =33<U+2013>34|isbn = 1886483612}}</ref> [[Henry Ford]]'s invention of the [[automobile]] in the early twentieth century made Half Day a more accessible destination to other communities within the [[Chicago metropolitan area]], and the village became a popular recreation area, prompting the opening of numerous businesses catering to the increasing influx of visitors; the era saw the erection of an amusement park, a race track, a bowling alley, a dance hall, and a number of taverns.<ref name=history1 /><ref name=history2 />

===Recent History===

After the end of [[World War I]], [[Vernon Township, Lake County, Illinois|Vernon Township]], in which the village of [[Half Day, Illinois|Half Day]] lay, was carved up between wealthy farmers. [[Edward Ryerson]], [[Adlai E. Stevenson II]], [[Samuel Insull]], and [[Louis Leverone]] bought the majority of the territory within Vernon Township borders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ryersonwoods.org/p/general.html|title=General Information - Historical Facts|accessdate=2008-08-20 |work=Ryerson Woods|publisher=Pustelnik Designs and Friends of Ryerson Woods|date=2001-2008}}</ref> Leverone, who had purchased the Half Day area, sold the village to developer Roger Ladd and his eponymous company in 1955. The company organized a residential subdivision out of the ceded town of Half Day and dubbed it "Lincolnshire", the precursor to the present-day village of the same name. However, life in the village was problematic, as the new subdivision was serviced by [[dirt road]]s and had neither a sufficient communal sewage and sanitation system nor a gas line. Lincolnshire's police coverage was weakened by the fact that officers patrolling the area had to be dispatched from [[Waukegan]] to the north. As a result, the Cambridge Forest Association (CFA) was formed to lobby for improvement in the livelihoods of the people of Lincolnshire. With sponsorship from the Cambridge Forest Association, Lincolnshire was incorporated as a village on [[August 5]], [[1957]]. The CFA was later renamed the Lincolnshire Community Association, and continues to play a large role in the political life of the village.<ref name=history1>{{cite web |url=http://www.village.lincolnshire.il.us/community/history.php|title=Lincolnshire Village History|accessdate=2008-08-18 |work=Village of Lincolnshire Website|publisher=Village of Lincolnshire|date=2008}}</ref><ref name=history2>Various authors: "Lincolnshire Information Report", ''A History of Lincolnshire'', 2004.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.village.lincolnshire.il.us/community/links/clinks-lca.php |title=Lincolnshire Community Links: LCA |accessdate=2008-08-20 |work=Village of Lincolnshire Website|publisher=Village of Lincolnshire Website|date=2008}}</ref>

Lincolnshire's government supported a conservative and cautious approach, and refused the annexations of two corporate park divisions in the 1980s; however, opposition to the village government's methods, which supported a quick growth to rival that of the surrounding villages' increasing affluence, won out in later years, overseeing the cessions of the Marriott Lincolnshire Resort and [[Lincolnshire Corporate Center]] to the village over a period of years starting in 1983. Lincolnshire sought to annex the old remnants of Half Day from which it was created but lost in a court battle with the village of [[Vernon Hills, Illinois|Vernon Hills]] to the north in 1994; this created the present day border between Lincolnshire and Vernon Hills, which lies along [[Illinois Route 22|Route 22]] until it meets [[Milwaukee Avenue (Chicago)|Milwaukee Avenue]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1301.html|title=Vernon Hills, IL|accessdate=2008-08-23|author=Marilyn Elizabeth Perry |work=Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |date=1990 }}</ref> To consolidate all these new acquisitions, Lincolnshire set to work on a new village hall and completed it in 1993, and built downtown area in what would become the Lincolnshire Corporate Center, City Park, and the Lincolnshire Commons, centered around the intersection of Aptakisic Road and Milwaukee Avenue.<ref name=CP>{{cite web |url=http://www.gocitypark.com/location.html|title=City Park Location|accessdate=2008-08-23 |work=Go City Park!.com |publisher=Village of Lincolnshire |date=2008}}</ref><ref name=LNCC>{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnshirecommons.com/html/mallinfo.asp|title=Mall Information|accessdate=2008-08-23|work=Lincolnshire Commons.com|publisher=GGP.com|date=2007}}</ref> These facilities were planned and constructed from the mid-1990s to the mid 2000s.<ref name=LINC>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/748.html|title=Lincolnshire, IL|accessdate=2008-08-23 |author=Douglas Knox|date=1995|work=Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago Historical Society}}</ref>

In 2005, [[Buffalo Grove, Illinois|Buffalo Grove]] and Lincolnshire reached a boundary agreement concerning with respect to the allocation of properties and of the unincorporated [[Prairie View, Illinois|Prairie View]] area, which lay in between the two Lake County villages. The agreement equalized the acreage for the two separate settlements in the area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.village.lincolnshire.il.us/services/comdev/news-boundaryAgreement.php|title=Boundary Agreement with the Village of Buffalo Grove|accessdate=2008-09-13 |work=Department of Community Development (Lincolnshire)|publisher=Villages of Lincolnshire and Buffalo Grove|date=2005}}</ref>

==Geography==
Lincolnshire is located at {{coor dms|42|11|47|N|87|55|2|W|city}} (42.196435, -87.917263).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/tiger/tms/gazetteer/places.txt|title=Places|accessdate=2005-05-03 |work=1990s Gazeteer Files |publisher=[[US Census Bureau]] |date=1990 }}</ref>

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the village has a total area of 4.4&nbsp;[[square mile]]s (11.5&nbsp;[[km<U+00B2>]]), of which, 4.4&nbsp;square miles (11.4&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of it is land and 0.04&nbsp;square miles (0.1&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of it (0.68%) is water.

The [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] village is a suburb of the city of [[Chicago]], being situated in the southern reaches of [[Lake County, Illinois|Lake County]], and therefore located in the extreme northeast of the state of [[Illinois]]. The [[Des Plaines River]] meanders through the eastern part of the village, dividing the town in half vertically at the village hall, while [[Half Day Road]] (Illinois Route 22) splits the village in half in an east<U+2013>west direction. [[Milwaukee Road]] becomes Illinois Route&nbsp;45 in nearby [[Vernon Hills, Illinois|Vernon Hills]], running in a north<U+2013>south direction through Lincolnshire and into the village of [[Buffalo Grove, Illinois|Buffalo Grove]].<ref name=mappymap>{{cite web |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1T4ADBF_enUS229US230&q=Lincolnshire+IL+map&um=1&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&resnum=1&ct=title|title=Map of Lincolnshire, Illinois|accessdate=2008-08-18 |work=Google Maps|publisher=Google, Inc.|date=2008}}</ref> 

Lincolnshire has been a [[Tree City USA]] every year since 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arborday.org/programs/treeCityUSA/TreeCities.cfm?chosenState=Illinois&orderBy=Years|title=Tree Cities in Illinois |accessdate=2008-08-31 |work=Arborday.org|publisher=Arbor Day Foundation |date=2008}}</ref> It has won the Tree City Growth Award for 13 consecutive years. To maintain Lincolnshire's trees the village passed the "Tree Preservation Ordinance" which puts strict restrictions on tree removal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.village.lincolnshire.il.us/services/forestry/ordinance.php|title=Tree Preservation Ordinance|accessdate=2008-08-18 |work=Lincolnshire Forestry Services|publisher=Village of Lincolnshire|date=2008}}</ref> and is working towards the eradication of [[gypsy moth]]s in their area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.village.lincolnshire.il.us/services/forestry/gypsy_moths.php|title=Information Concerning Gypsy Moths|accessdate=2008-08-18 |work=Lincolnshire Forestry Services|publisher=Village of Lincolnshire|date=2008}}</ref> 

Lincolnshire lies on the border of two Chicago-area watersheds, with one pertaining to the Des Plaines River, and the other involving the nearby north fork of the [[Chicago River]]. This situation is due in part to the presence of the Des Plaines River in the village.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.co.lake.il.us/smc/images/maps/SubShedMap_0805.jpg|title=Subwatershed Map of Lake County|accessdate=2008-09-11 |work=Stormwater Management Commission|publisher=County of Lake, Illinois|date=2004}}</ref>

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of Chicago}}

Due to its proximity to the city, Lincolnshire's climate shares many of the same traits as Chicago, across the southern county line in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]]. Similar to Chicago, Lincolnshire is in the [[humid continental climate]] zone and experiences four clearly discernible seasons. Lincolnshire receives an average of 36.28 inches of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] each year;<ref name=TIEMPO>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/60069|title=Monthly Weather Averages for the Village of Lincolnshire|publisher=[[The Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]]|accessdate=2008-10-01}}</ref> approximately 110 days every year are dominated by precipitation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://climate.fizber.com/illinois-city-lincolnshire-climate.html|title=Lincolnshire, Illinois Climate, Weather|accessdate=2008-08-18|work=Fizber.com|publisher=Fizber.com|date=2008}}</ref>

==Sports and recreation==

Lincolnshire, despite its relatively small size, is home to nine public park areas. Spring Lake Park, which is centered around the eponymous lake and sports a small beachhead, hosts Lincolnshire's festivities during the Fourth of July and is renowned throughout the area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.village.lincolnshire.il.us/services/parks/parkspaths/springlake.php|title=Parks and Paths - Spring Lake Park|accessdate=2008-08-30 |work=Department of Parks and Recreation|publisher=Village of Lincolnshire|date=2008}}</ref> North Park, a major sporting field and nature reserve in northeastern Lincolnshire, collaborated with [[Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103]] to meet both the growing need for youth sports teams and extra recreational public park space;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.village.lincolnshire.il.us/services/parks/parkspaths/northpark.php|title=Parks and Paths - North Park and North Park Nature Preserve|accessdate=2008-08-30 |work=Department of Parks and Recreation|publisher=Village of Lincolnshire|date=2008}}</ref> North Park and Spring Lake Park are important enough to the village's vitality that they are considered Lincolnshire's "jewels."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.village.lincolnshire.il.us/services/parks/news_jewels.php|title=Jewels of Lincolnshire - Our Parks!|accessdate=2008-08-30 |work=Department of Parks and Recreation|publisher=Village of Lincolnshire|date=August 2007}}</ref> School District 103 also collaborated with the village of Lincolnshire to create an educational nature center called Rivershire Park, which is located in southeastern Lincolnshire.

==Government==

[[Image:Lincolnshire IL Village Hall 2.JPG|thumb|right|The village hall, where the government of Lincolnshire meets regularly.]]

The government of Lincolnshire is constituted as a [[Council-manager government|Council-manager form government]] with elements of [[Home rule]],<ref name=gubby>{{cite web |url=http://www.village.lincolnshire.il.us/community/demographics/index.php|title=Demographics|accessdate=2008-09-13 |work=Demographics of Lincolnshire|publisher=Village of Lincolnshire|date=2008}}</ref> which it adopted via ordinance in 1976.<ref name=history1 /> The village is headed by a [[mayor]] who presides over a board of six [[trustee]]s at every meeting, although the daily functions of the village are carried out by a professional salaried village manager. Once elected, the mayor serves a four-year term; the elected trustees serve four year terms that are staggered. The mayor is appoints a village manager, although the manager cannot take office until the Board of Trustees have approved of the mayor's choice.<ref name=Gobierno>{{Cite book

</ref>

Government meetings are generally conducted on the second and fourth Monday of the month. In the case of a tie, the mayor has the [[casting vote]]. Mayors of Lincolnshire can veto propositions set forth by the Board of Trustees, although this move may be overridden by a two-thirds vote of the trustees.<ref name=Gobierno />

===Safety===

Lincolnshire is served by its own [[police|police department]], which is based in the village hall.<ref>'''''Note:''''' This is so because both apparently have the same address.</ref> This police force is staffed by twenty-seven full-time members, with twenty-five of them being sworn police officers and the other two community service personnel. The Lincolnshire Police Department runs an emergency center that accepts [[9-1-1|911]] calls in the area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.village.lincolnshire.il.us/services/police/index.php|title=Police Department Home Page|accessdate=2008-09-07 |work=Department of the Police|publisher=Village of Lincolnshire|date=2008}}</ref>

The Lincolnshire Police Department collaborates with Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103's junior high school, Daniel Wright, to form a chapter of the [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education]] program. This program has graduated sixth graders from the school every year since 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.village.lincolnshire.il.us/services/police/news_dare.php|title=DARE News|accessdate=2008-09-07 |work=Department of the Police|publisher=Village of Lincolnshire|date=2008}}</ref>

Because of increasing incidents of speeding within Lincolnshire village limits, the police department now enforces speeding laws more strictly, increasing the cost of a speeding ticket to $75 and setting up [[speed traps]] involving both [[Police car#Functional types|patrol]] and [[Police car#Functional types|unmarked]] vehicles to catch more offenders who break the twenty mile per hour speed limit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.village.lincolnshire.il.us/services/police/news_speeding.php|title=Speeding in Lincolnshire|accessdate=2008-09-07 |work=Department of the Police|publisher=Village of Lincolnshire|date=2008}}</ref> The Lincolnshire Police Department also charges those who break the speed limit within village parks with [[reckless driving]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.village.lincolnshire.il.us/services/police/news_speedingParks.php|title=Double Trouble when Speeding in Parks|accessdate=2008-09-07 |work=Department of the Police|publisher=Village of Lincolnshire|date=2008}}</ref>

The village is served by the [[Lincolnshire-Riverwoods Fire Protection District]], which employs forty sworn [[firefighters]], four civilian firefighters, and six contract workers; thirty-four district employees are certified [[paramedic]]s. The Fire Protection District is formed by two stations: one located in central Lincolnshire, slightly to the west of the village hall, the other in [[Riverwoods, Illinois|Riverwoods]]. The Fire Protection District runs free services and programs, including fire safety surveys of houses in the area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.village.lincolnshire.il.us/services/fire/index.php|title=Fire Department|accessdate=2008-09-13 |work=Department of Fire Protection|publisher=Village of Lincolnshire|date=2008}}</ref>

Lincolnshire lies in a [[floodplain]] region, a consequence of the presence of the Des Plaines River and the proximity a fork of the [[Chicago River]] on the far east border and of the small Indian Creek, which runs to the north of Lincolnshire. The village participates in the [[National Flood Insurance Program]], a [[FEMA]] project, to alleviate a portion of the costs of flood damage that may overtax affected village residents. The village also implements the Community Rating System, a disaster readiness plan.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jennifer|last=Hughes|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Lincolnshire Flood Warning Pamphlet|url= |work=Engineering Division|publisher=Village of Lincolnshire|date=June 2004|accessdate=2008-09-13 }}</ref>

==Education==

[[Image:Stevenson High School Lincolnshire IL.JPG|thumb|right|Adlai E. Stevenson High School]]

Lincolnshire has two school districts: [[Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103]] and [[Adlai E. Stevenson High School District 125]], although a few students living in the village also attend school in [[Aptakisic-Tripp Community Consolidated School District 102]], which is based in neighboring [[Buffalo Grove, Illinois|Buffalo Grove]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.co.lake.il.us/about/communities/lincolnshire.asp|title=About Lincolnshire|accessdate=2008-09-06 |work=About Lake County|publisher=County of Lake, Illinois|date=2008 }}</ref> District&nbsp;103, which feeds into District 125, is home to three schools: Laura B. Sprague Elementary School, Half Day Intermediate School, and [[Daniel Wright Junior High School]]; District&nbsp;125 comprises only [[Stevenson High School (Lincolnshire, Illinois)|Adlai E. Stevenson High School]]. Both are [[Public school|public school districts]], funded by the government.

[[Image:VAPLD Lincolnshire IL.JPG|thumb|right|The Vernon Area Library, which is located within Lincolnshire.]]

The first school to be built in what is now Lincolnshire was Half Day Intermediate School, which initially served all grades for the small town; it was originally a one-room [[schoolhouse]] before a major expansion project was undertaken to accommodate the district's increasing population. Numerous changes were made to Half Day School between 1958 and 1965, but it remained too small to take in all prospective students; in 1983, Half Day School was closed because of the growth of Laura B. Sprague Elementary School and Daniel Wright Junior High School. It was, however, reopened nine years later as Daniel Wright and Laura Sprague began to fill to capacity.<ref name=halfda>{{cite web |url=http://www.halfday.district103.k12.il.us/about+school.htm|title=About Our School|accessdate=2008-08-23 |work=Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103 Webring|publisher=Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103|date=2001-2008}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

[[Image:Route 22 Lincolnshire IL.jpg|thumb|right|Illinois Route 22 within Lincolnshire borders on a sunny afternoon.]]

Lincolnshire lies on three arterial roads: [[Illinois Route 22]], which is known as Half Day Road in this area; Milwaukee Road, which appears as [[U.S. Route 45 in Illinois|Illinois Route 45]]; and Aptakisic Road, which meets Milwaukee in the southern region of Lincolnshire. Lincolnshire shares its eastern border with the village of [[Bannockburn, Illinois|Bannockburn]] at [[Interstate 94]] when it is considered a portion the [[Tri-State Tollway]]. Route 22 crosses the Des Plaines River before bridging Bannockburn and Lincolnshire by arching over Interstate Highway 94.<ref name=mappymap />

Lincolnshire has two primary [[Segregated cycle facilities|bike paths]] that cover a large expanse of the village, with one running in a north-south direction alongside Riverwoods Road in the eastern half of the village, and the other running in a east-west direction from the eastern half of the village across the Des Plaines River to the village hall on the west side of the village. Smaller bike paths connect individual neighborhood areas within and around Lincolnshire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.village.lincolnshire.il.us/services/parks/parkspaths/index.php|title=Parks and Paths|accessdate=2008-09-07 |work=Department of Parks and Recreation|publisher=Village of Lincolnshire|date=2008}}</ref>

[[O'Hare International Airport]] is eighteen miles to the southwest of the village of Lincolnshire. Travel between Lincolnshire and the airport is facilitated by the Tri-State Tollway,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marriott.com/hotels/maps/travel/chiln-lincolnshire-marriott-resort/|title=Maps and Transportation|accessdate=2008-09-08 |work=Lincolnshire Marriott Resort|publisher=Marriott International, Inc.|date=2008}}</ref> although travel by railway is also possible because of the proximity to the village of the [[Prairie View (Metra)|Prairie View metra station]], which is in the eponymous unincorporated community just off of Lincolnshire's western borders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://metrarail.com/Sched/ncs/prairie_view.shtml|title=Prairie View Station Information |accessdate=2008-09-13 |work=Metra North Central Service|publisher=Commuter Rail Division of the Regional Transportation Authority|date=1995-2008}}</ref>

===Utilities===

The village of Lincolnshire negotiated and signed an agreement with the village of [[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]] in 1982 to create a more efficient means of obtaining water by purchasing filtered water from [[Lake Michigan]]. The village also monitors the public pumps and [[water meter]]s of private residents. Lincolnshire is serviced by a [[sanitary sewer]] that connects to the Lake County Sewage Treatment Plant, which lies on the Des Plaines River outside the village limits; the disposal of wastewater is left to the government of Lake County rather than the village of Lincolnshire itself. Lincolnshire also runs a network of storm drains that run directly into the Des Plaines River; to protect the river's cleaniness, the village government has outlawed dumping of most chemicals into the network of [[storm drain]]s.<ref name=sewages>{{cite web|url=http://www.village.lincolnshire.il.us/services/pw/divisions/water.php|title=Water and Sewer Division|accessdate=2008-09-13 |work=Department of Public Works|publisher=Village of Lincolnshire|date=2008}}</ref> A plan to repair city streets was also implemented in 1982, and continues; the village also offers public services to clear the streets during the fall and winter from fallen leaves and snow respectively, although on its arterial roads (Illinois Routes 22, 45, and Aptakisic Road) residents are provided with bags to clear their curbs during autumn months as it is not possible for the village to safely clear the roads of leaf debris. The village of Lincolnshire regularly sweeps the streets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.village.lincolnshire.il.us/services/pw/divisions/streets.php|title=Streets and Drainage Division|accessdate=2008-09-13 |work=Department of Public Works|publisher=Village of Lincolnshire|date=2008}}</ref>
