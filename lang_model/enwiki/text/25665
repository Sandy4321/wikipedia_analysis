}}'''Tatiana Avenirovna Proskouriakoff''' ([[January 23]], [[1909]] <U+2013> [[August 30]], [[1985]]) was a [[Russian-American]] [[Mayanist]] scholar and [[archaeologist]] who contributed significantly to the decipherment of [[Maya script|Maya hieroglyphs]], the [[writing system]] of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]] of [[Mesoamerica]]. 

==Early life==
She was born in [[Tomsk]], [[Russian Empire]], to a chemist and his physician wife. The family travelled to the [[United States]] in 1915, her father being asked by [[Czar Nicholas II]] to oversee the production of munitions for [[World War I]]. The [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] forced the family to remain permanently. She was to visit Russia only once after that, to meet the Mayanist [[Yuri Knorozov]].

They lived for a while in [[Ohio]], moved to the [[Philadelphia]] area, before settling down in [[Lansdowne, Pennsylvania]]. Tatiana did very well at school, was the editor of the school yearbook, and graduated valedictorian of her class.

She spent a year studying at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], before graduating from the [[Pennsylvania State University]] in 1930. Initially educated as an architect, she later went on to work for [[Linton Satterthwaite]] and for the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]] at the Maya site of [[Piedras Negras, Guatemala|Piedras Negras]] in 1936<U+2013>37. She made a reconstruction drawing of the Piedras Negras Acropolis on her return to [[Philadelphia]]. She was buried there in the F group, a plaque in her honor shows her tomb.

==Reconstructive archaeology==
[[Image:Proskouriakoff Structure I at Xpuhil.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Proskouriakoff's reconstructive drawing of Structure 1 at [[Xpuhil]] (1943)]]When [[Sylvanus Morley]] saw the panoramic reconstruction on a visit to the Museum, he was impressed, and prevailed upon her to make more, for the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]]. Unable to get the institution to hire her, he raised funds to enable Proskouriakoff to travel to [[Cop<U+00E1>n]] and [[Yucat<U+00E1>n]], which she did in 1939. Returning after she completed the drawings, she was given the post of a research associate at the Institution in the early 1940s. 

She soon became involved in [[Maya hieroglyphs]] and made significant contributions to the understanding of Mayan written language. Her greatest contribution was considered the breakthrough for Maya hieroglyphic decipherment in the late 1950s and early 1960s. She discovered that the writing on the monumental stela and other buildings was actually historical, dealing with the birth, accession, and death dates for the Maya rulers. Analyzing the pattern of dates and hieroglyphs, she was able to demonstrate a sequence of seven rulers who ruled over a span of two hundred years. Knowing the context of the inscriptions, Maya epigraphers were then able to decipher the hieroglyphs.

She became honorary curator, [[Maya art]], of the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]] in 1958. 
Tatiana Proskouriakoff died in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] on [[August 30]], [[1985]]. She was 76 years old.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news |first=Sullivan |last=Walter |title=Tatiana Proskouriakoff dies; key figure in Mayan studies |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A14FD385F0C728DDDA00894DD484D81 |publisher=New York Times |page=27 |date=1985-09-11 |accessdate=2008-09-14 }}</ref>
