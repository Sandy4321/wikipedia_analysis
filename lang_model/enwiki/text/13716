"'''I See the Light'''" is a song written by composer [[Alan Menken]] and lyricist [[Glenn Slater]] for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Pictures]]' 50th animated feature film ''[[Tangled]] ''(2010). A duet originally recorded by American recording artist and actress [[Mandy Moore]] and American actor [[Zachary Levi]] in their respective film roles as main characters [[Rapunzel (Disney)|Rapunzel]] and Flynn Rider, the [[Folk music|folk]]-inspired [[pop music|pop]] [[Ballad music|ballad]] serves as both the film's [[Love song|love]] and [[theme song|theme song.]] Lyrically, "I See the Light" describes the developing romantic relationship between Rapunzel and Flynn.

''Tangled ''was originally conceived by Disney animator [[Glen Keane]]. Subsequently, the studio hired veteran Disney composer Alan Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater to collaborate on writing the film's songs. Initially, Menken and Slater had written a more[[anthem| anthemic]] version of "I See the Light" before finally reworking it into a gentler, simpler and more folk-oriented song. Menken would later reveal that, out of ''Tangled''<nowiki/>'s eight songs and [[Number (music)|musical numbers]], he is most proud of "I See the Light".

"I See the Light" has inspired a generally mixed reception from film and music critics, who were mostly ambivalent towards the song's content and originality, describing it as passable but predictable. However, the musical sequence during which "I See the Light" is performed by Rapunzel and Flynn has enjoyed widespread acclaim, with commentators praising the scene's visuals, specifically its use of [[3D film|3D technology]]. Critically, both the song and scene have received comparisons to "[[Kiss the Girl]]" from ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]] ''(1989) and "[[A Whole New World]]" from ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]] ''(1992), both of which are also love songs composed by Menken. 

"I See the Light" has garnered numerous awards and accolades. The song was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Golden Globe awards for Best Original Song]] in 2011, losing each, the former to "[[We Belong Together (Randy Newman song)|We Belong Together]]" from ''[[Toy Story 3]] ''(2010) and the latter to "[[You Haven't Seen the Last of Me]]" from ''[[Burlesque (2010 American film)|Burlesque]] ''(2010). The song won both the [[Las Vegas Film Critics Society Award]] for [[Las Vegas Film Critics Society Award for Best Song|Best Song]] and the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media|Best Song Written for Visual Media]]. Since it's release, "I See the Light" has been covered by a variety of musical artists, including classical singer [[Jackie Evancho]].

== Background and writing ==
The concept of an animated film based on the [[Brothers Grimm]] fairy tale "[[Rapunzel]]" originated from Disney animator [[Glen Keane]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/tangled-glen-keane-interview|title = Tangled - Glen Keane interview|website = IndieLondon|publisher = IndieLondon.co.uk|year = 2010|accessdate = December 17, 2013}}</ref> Veteran Disney composer [[Alan Menken]] had just recently completed scoring [[Walt Disney Pictures]]' ''[[The Shaggy Dog (2006 film)|The Shaggy Dog]] ''(2006) and ''[[Enchanted (film)|Enchanted]] ''(2007) when he received a telephone call from [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]], inviting him to score the studio's then-upcoming animated [[Musical film|musical]] ''[[Tangled]]''.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url = http://collider.com/alan-menken-interview-tangled/|title = Alan Menken Exclusive Interview TANGLED|year = 2010|website = Collider|publisher = Collider.com|accessdate = December 15, 2013|last = Graham|first = Bill}}</ref> As his lyricist, Menken selected frequent collaborator [[Glenn Slater]].<ref name=":10" /> Aware that ''Tangled ''is "not a [traditional] musical like ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' or [''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The]]''] ''[[Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''", both for which Menken composed, he labeled the film a "hybrid"<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://movies.about.com/od/rapunzel/a/Alan-Menken-Interview.htm|title = Exclusive Interview with Alan Menken on 'Tangled'|accessdate = December 15, 2013|website = About.com|publisher = About.com|first = Rebecca|last = Murray|year = 2010}}</ref> because it is "far from [a] classic break into song musical."<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/725326/alan_menken_interview_tangled_movie_scores_musicals_enchanted_2_snow_queen_and_more.html|title = Alan Menken interview: Tangled, movie scores, musicals, Enchanted 2, Snow Queen and more|date = January 11, 2011|website = Den of Geek|last = Brew|first = Simon|accessdate = December 15, 2013|publisher = Dennis Publishing Limited}}</ref> For ''Tangled'', Menken challenged himself to create a unique sound that differed from his previous work, explaining that both ''Tangled ''and ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame ''(1996) are essentially about a "young-protagonist-trapped-in-a-tower".<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://insidemovies.ew.com/2010/11/24/alan-menken-tangled/|title = Alan Menken discusses 'Tangled' and the past, present, and future of the animated musical|date = November 24, 2010|accessdate = December 15, 2013|publisher = Entertainment Weekly Inc|website = Entertainment Weekly|last = Blauvelt|first = Christian}}</ref> Inspired by [[Rapunzel (Disney)|Rapunzel]]'s "long hair and the freedom she wanted", Menken drew influence from the genre of 1960s [[folk rock]], citing Canadian singer-songwriter [[Joni Mitchell]] as a major source of inspiration.<ref name=":8" /><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/11/unwrapping-the-music-in-tangled-it-all-begins-with-joni-mitchell-says-alan-menken.html|title = Unwrapping the music in 'Tangled': It all begins with Joni Mitchell, says Alan Menken|date = November 24, 2010|website = Los Angeles Times|publisher = Los Angeles Times|accessdate = December 15, 2013|last = Martens|first = Todd}}</ref> Menken also emphasized the use of the [[acoustic guitar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.mouseclubhouse.com/Interviews/alan-menken/alan-menken.htm|title = Alan Menken talks about "Tangled," and his other Disney work|website = Mouse Clubhouse|last = Wolf|first = Scott|accessdate = December 15, 2013|year = 2010}}</ref><ref name=":9">{{Cite web|url = http://www.scottholleran.com/old/interviews/alan-menken.htm|title = Alan Menken on Disney's Tangled|website = Scott Holleran|accessdate = December 15, 2013|last = Holleran|first = Scott|year = 2010}}</ref>

When writing the film's songs and [[Number (music)|musical numbers]], Menken and Slater "looked for what is going to be an appropriate song moment for the main characters." In the case of "I See the Light", Menken explained, "The lantern song, again, flows pretty much out of the sense of completion and [Rapunzel] finally sees the lanterns and has this moment. It<U+2019>s more of a montage number."<ref name=":8" /> Originally, "I See the Light" was intended to sound more "anthem-like" until Menken and Slater decided to write a "gentler", more [[Folk music|folk]]-oriented rendition of the song. Menken elaborated, "we began throwing melodies up, doing songs and riffs and harmonies, and we waited for something to stick". Menken eventually admitted that, out of the film's eight musical numbers, he is "most proud" of "I See the Light",<ref name=":9" /> elaborating, "The song is a great moment in the film and I am very happy with the beauty and simplicity of the song."<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.mediamikes.com/2011/01/interview-with-alan-menken/|title = Interview with Alan Menken|date = January 12, 2011|accessdate = December 16, 2013|website = Mania.com|publisher = Media Mikes|last = Gencarelli|first = Mike}}</ref>

Technically, the reflection of the floating lanterns in the rippling water is amazing, but aesthetically, it is a marvel. There is a perfect confluence of emotion and music and visuals as Flynn and Rapunzel drift through a field of stars and burst into song as they fall in love."
