== History ==
=== Formation and early years (1994<U+2013>1996) ===

[[File:1-sadds.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Otto (drummer)|John Otto]] studied [[jazz]] drumming and played in local [[avant garde music|avant garde]] bands before joining Limp Bizkit.]]

[[Fred Durst]] grew up in [[Gastonia, North Carolina]], where he took an interest in [[breakdancing]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[punk rock]] and [[heavy metal music]]. He began to [[rapping|rap]], [[skateboard|skate]], [[beatboxing|beatbox]] and [[disc jockey|deejay]]. While mowing lawns and working as a tattoo artist, he developed an idea for a band that combined elements of [[rock music|rock]] and hip hop.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Devenish |first1=Colin |title=Limp Bizkit |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's |isbn=031226349X |pages=1-20}}</ref> Durst played with three other bands, Split 26, Malachi Sage, which were unsuccessful, and 10 Foot Shindig, which Durst left to form a new band.<ref name=Devenish21>{{cite book |last1=Devenish |first1=Colin |title=Limp Bizkit |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's |isbn=031226349X |pages=21-51}}</ref> Durst told [[Sam Rivers (bassist)|Sam Rivers]], the bassist for Malachi Sage, "You need to quit this band and start a band with me that's like this: rappin' and rockin'."<ref name=Devenish21/> Rivers suggested that his cousin, [[John Otto (drummer)|John Otto]], who was studying [[jazz]] drumming at the Douglas Anderson School of the Arts and playing in local [[avant garde music|avant garde]] bands, become their drummer.<ref name=Devenish21/> Durst, Rivers and Otto jammed and wrote three songs together, and [[Wes Borland]] later joined as a guitarist.<ref name=Devenish21/>

Durst named the band Limp Bizkit, because he wanted a name that would repel listeners. According to Durst, "The name is there to turn people's heads away. A lot of people pick up the disc and go, 'Limp Bizkit. Oh, they must suck.' Those are the people that we don't even want listening to our music."<ref name=Devenish21/> Every record label that showed an interest in the band pressured its members to change its name.<ref name=Devenish21/> Unbeknownst to the band, the phrase "limp biscuit", known alternatively as "[[soggy biscuit]]", is a phrase used in the United Kingdom and Australia for a game in which teenage boys stand around a biscuit or a piece of bread masturbating; the player who [[ejaculation|ejaculates]] last has to eat the bread.<ref name=Devenish21/>

Limp Bizkit developed a [[cult following]] in the [[underground music]] scene, particularly at the Milk Bar, an underground punk club in Florida. The band's local popularity was such that [[Sugar Ray]], who had a major label contract, opened for a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit at this club.<ref name=Devenish21/> The club's owner, Danny Wimmer, stated that Limp Bizkit "had the biggest draw for a local band. They went from playing [for] ten people to eight hundred within months. Fred [...] was always marketing the band. He would go to record stores and get people involved, he was in touch with high schools."<ref name=Devenish21/> However, the band knew that to achieve national success, they would have to distinguish themselves in their live performances.<ref name=Devenish21/> Attracting crowds by [[word of mouth]], the band gave energetic live performances, covering [[George Michael]]'s "[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]" and [[Paula Abdul]]'s "[[Straight Up (Paula Abdul song)|Straight Up]]", and featuring Borland in bizarre costumes.<ref name=Devenish21/> Borland's theatrical rock style was the primary attraction for many concert attendees.<ref name=Devenish21/>

Durst unsuccessfully tried to attract attention from A&R representatives at various labels by pretending to be the band's manager.<ref name=Devenish21/> Later, when [[Korn]] performed in town as the opening act for [[Sick of It All]], Durst invited Korn to drink beer and tattoo them. Although Durst's tattoos were unimpressive, he was able to persuade [[Reginald Arvizu]] to listen to a [[demo (music)|demo]], consisting of the songs "Pollution", "[[Counterfeit (song)|Counterfeit]]" and "Stuck". Korn added a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit to two tours, which exposed the band to a new audience.<ref name=Devenish21/><ref name="amg">{{cite web |last=Bush |first=John |title=Limp Bizkit&nbsp;<U+2013> Biography |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p213327/biography|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=Allmusic |year=2006 |accessdate=January 27, 2008}}</ref> The band attempted to expand their sound by auditioning an additional guitarist, but Borland soon determined that another guitarist wasn't the answer, and [[DJ Lethal]], formerly of the [[hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[House of Pain]], joined the band as a [[turntablist]] after a successful practice performance. Joining the band gave Lethal an opportunity to experiment with his turntable technique in ways that hip hop had not allowed him to do, helping shape the band's style. However, Borland left the band over creative differences.<ref name=Devenish21/>

=== ''Three Dollar Bill, Yall$'' (1997<U+2013>1998) ===

[[File:Fred Durst at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival.JPG|thumb|Following the release of ''Three Dollar Bill, Yall$'', vocalist Fred Durst was appointed Senior Vice President of A&R at Interscope.]]

After a impressive performance when they opened for Korn at the Dragonfly in Hollywood, Limp Bizkit signed with [[Mojo Records|Mojo]], a subsidiary of [[MCA Records]]. While heading to California to record their first album, the band wrecked their van. As a result of the near death experience, Durst made amends with Borland, who rejoined the band.<ref name=Devenish21/> After a dispute with Mojo, Limp Bizkit signed with [[Flip Records (1994)|Flip]], a subsidiary of [[Interscope Records]]. Arvizu persuaded [[Ross Robinson]] to listen to the demo, who finally listened to the tape after it was appraised by Robinson's girlfriend. Impressed by the band's motivation and sound, Robinson produced Limp Bizkit's debut, which was recorded at Indigo Ranch. Durst's problems with his girlfriend inspired him to write the song "Sour".<ref name=Devenish21/> The mood and tone set by Robinson in the studio allowed the band to improvise; a recording of the band improvising appeared as the last track on the album, "Everything".<ref name=Devenish21/>

Despite the success of live performances of the band's cover of the song "Faith", Robinson was opposed to recording it, and tried to persuade the band not to play it on the album. However, the final recording, which incorporated heavier guitar playing and drumming, as well as DJ scratching, impressed him.<ref name=Devenish21/> Robinson also bonded with Borland, who he perceived as not taking the band seriously.<ref name=Devenish21/> The [[progressive metal]] band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] provided a strong influence in shaping the album's sound, particularly in the song "Nobody Loves Me", which contains a breakdown in which Durst imitated the singing style of [[Maynard James Keenan]].<ref name=Devenish21/> Durst was also inspired by ''[[Church of Realities]]'', an EP by the punk band [[Hed PE]], which he listened to during the production of Limp Bizkit's debut.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beat.com.au/music/2011/01/24/hed-pe/coming-out-commercial-label-territory-corner-hotel-countless-times-difficult-changes-drastic-change |title=(HED) P.e. |author=Dillinger, Moses |date=January 24, 2011 |work= |publisher=Beat Magazine |accessdate=14 December 2011}}</ref>

Continuing the band's policy of using names that would repulse potential listeners, the band named the album by using part of the phrase "queer as a three dollar bill" and adding the word "Y'all" for Florida flavor, naming the album, ''[[Three Dollar Bill, Yall$]]''<ref name=Devenish21/> The completed album featured an abrasive, angry sound which Limp Bizkit used to attract listeners to their music.<ref name=Devenish21/> After the band completed recording, they toured with Korn and [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]]. Critics reacted unfavorably to performances of Korn and Limp Bizkit; ''Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel'' music critic Jon M. Gilbertson criticized Durst's performance, stating "The one attention-grabbing moment of Limp Bizkit's [[rap metal|rap/thrash]] show was when the lead singer expressed a desire for [[Homosexuality|gay]] men to be 'stomped'. Which isn't remotely rebellious. It's just puerile."<ref name=Devenish21/>

Interscope proposed to the band that the label pay $5,000 to guarantee that a Portland radio station play the song "Counterfeit" fifty times, preceded and concluded with an announcement that the air time was paid for by Interscope.<ref name=Devenish51>{{cite book |last1=Devenish |first1=Colin |title=Limp Bizkit |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's |isbn=031226349X |pages=51-78}}</ref><ref name=MTVJuly1998>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1431305/limp-bizkit-pays-counterfeit-play.jhtml |title="Limp Bizkit Pays For 'Counterfeit' Play" |author= |date=July 1, 1998 |work= |publisher=[[MTV News]] |accessdate=14 December 2011}}</ref> The paid air time was criticized by the media, who saw it as "[[payola]]".<ref name=Devenish51/><ref name=MTVJuly1998/> The band's manager Jeff Kwatinetz later termed the plan as a "brilliant marketing move".<ref name=Devenish51/> Durst stated, "It worked, but it's not that cool of a thing."<ref name=Devenish51/> Following the release of "Counterfeit" as a single, ''Three Dollar Bill, Yall$'' was released on July 1, 1997, and was met with minimal response. [[Allmusic]] writer [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote, "They might not have many original ideas [...] but they do the sound well. They have a powerful rhythm section and memorable hooks, most of which make up for the uneven songwriting."<ref name=ErlewineThreeDollarBill>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r278011/review |title=''Three Dollar Bill Y'All'' - Limp Bizkit |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=14 December 2011}}</ref> However, [[Robert Christgau]] panned the album.<ref name=Christgau>{{cite web |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Limp+Bizkit |title=Limp Bizkit Reviews |author=Christgau, Robert |accessdate=14 December 2011}}</ref> Despite the minimal response to his band's album, Durst was appointed Senior Vice President of A&R at Interscope.<ref name=Devenish127/> 

Limp Bizkit joined the [[Warped Tour]], performing alongside the bands [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]], [[Mighty Mighty Bosstones]], Sick of It All, [[Lagwagon]] and [[Blink 182]].<ref name=Devenish51/> Preceding their first tour with DJ Lethal, Otto became familiar with Lethal's contributions to collaborate with him better on stage.<ref name=Devenish51/> In addition to touring with [[Primus (band)|Primus]] and [[Deftones]], Limp Bizkit headlined the Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour, which was intended to diversify the band's fanbase, which was largely male, by offering free tickets to female attendees. This plan successfully increased the band's female fanbase.<ref name=Devenish51/>

In 1998, Limp Bizkit toured with Soulfly and Cold on Soulfly's first European tour.<ref name=Devenish51/> Touring consistently increased Limp Bizkit's success, and the third single from ''Three Dollar Bill, Yall$'', "Faith", became a radio hit, leading to a slot on [[Ozzfest]], a tour organized by [[Ozzy Osbourne|Ozzy]] and [[Sharon Osbourne]].<ref name=Devenish51/> In July, [[Snot (band)|Snot]] singer [[Lynn Strait]] was arrested after he emerged nude from Limp Bizkit's prop toilet, and was charged with indecent exposure.<ref name=Devenish51/><ref>{{cite news |title=Snot Singer Charged With Indecent Exposure |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1432993/07101998/snot.jhtml |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=July 10, 1998 |accessdate=2008-08-23 }}</ref> Because Limp Bizkit's fans would often break through the barricades, the band was almost kicked off the tour after two days.<ref name=Devenish51/> In August, John Otto spent the night in jail in Auburn Hills, Michigan, on a misdemeanor charge of carrying a concealed weapon, after allegedly firing a [[BB gun]] and being arrested for carrying a switchblade.<ref name=Devenish51/>

After completing Ozzfest, Limp Bizkit took a break from performing, and later performed on Korn's [[Family Values Tour]]. Durst also directed a music video for the band's single "Faith" in promotion for its appearance in the film ''[[Very Bad Things]]'', but was unsatisfied with it, and directed a second video which paid tribute to tourmates like Primus, Deftones and [[M<U+00F6>tley Cr<U+00FC>e]], who appeared in the video.<ref name=Devenish51/> Borland stated in an interview that George Michael, the writer of the song, hated the cover and "hates us for doing it".<ref name=Devenish51/>

=== ''Significant Other'' (1999<U+2013>2000) ===

[[File:DJ Lethal 2011.jpg|left|thumb|Beginning with ''[[Significant Other]]'' (1999), DJ Lethal expanded his role as [[sound design]]er for the band.]]

Following the radio success of "Faith", the band was determined to record the follow-up to their first album in order to show that they weren't a Korn ripoff or a cover band; the band began writing an album which dealt with issues deriving from their newfound fame.<ref name=Devenish79/> [[Terry Date]], who had produced albums for [[Pantera]], [[White Zombie]] and [[Deftones]], was chosen to produce the album.<ref name=Devenish95>{{cite book |last1=Devenish |first1=Colin |title=Limp Bizkit |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's |isbn=031226349X |pages=95-113}}</ref> The band allowed Durst and Lethal to explore their hip hop origins by recording a song with [[Method Man]]. The song was originally titled "Shut The Fuck Up", but was retitled "[[N 2 Gether Now]]" for marketing purposes.<ref name=Devenish95/> Durst also recorded with [[Eminem]], but the collaboration, "Turn Me Loose", was left off the album.<ref name=Devenish95/> The album also featured guest appearances by [[Stone Temple Pilots]] singer Scott Weiland, Korn's Jonathan Davis and Staind singer Aaron Lewis, and interludes by [[Les Claypool]] and [[Matt Pinfield]].<ref name=Devenish95/>

''[[Significant Other]]'' saw Limp Bizkit reaching a new level of commercial success; the band was featured on the covers of popular music magazines, including ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', and now found themselves repeatedly mobbed for autographs; the band was allowed to interact directly with their fans on a website established by Dike 99.<ref name=Devenish115/> Durst also moved from Jacksonville to Los Angeles. However, the band continued to be highly criticized by the media; an article profiling the band in ''Spin'' and discussing ''Significant Other'' claimed that "Limp Bizkit had yet to write a good song", and musicians [[Marilyn Manson]] and [[Trent Reznor]] criticized the band.<ref name=Devenish115>{{cite book |last1=Devenish |first1=Colin |title=Limp Bizkit |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's |isbn=031226349X |pages=115-125}}</ref>

The band promoted the album by playing unannounced concerts in Detroit and Chicago, as radio stations received a strong amount of requests for the album's first single, "Nookie".<ref name=Devenish127>{{cite book |last1=Devenish |first1=Colin |title=Limp Bizkit |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's |isbn=031226349X |pages=127-153}}</ref> ''Significant Other'' climbed to No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard 200|200]], selling 643,874 copies in its first week of release.<ref name=Devenish127/> In its second week of release, the album sold an additional 335,000 copies.<ref name=Devenish127/> On the opening night of the bnad's Limptropolis tour with [[Kid Rock]], Sam Rivers smashed his bass in frustration over the venue's poor sound, cutting his hand. After his hand was stitched up at a hospital, Rivers returned to finish the set.<ref name=Devenish127/> On July 12, Durst allegedly kicked a security guard in the head during a performance in St. Paul, Minnesota, and was later arrested on assault charges.<ref name=Devenish127/> Further criticisms of the band appeared in ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]''; ''New York Times'' writer Ann Powers wrote, "DJ Lethal used his turntables as a metal guitar, riffing expansively and going for effects instead of rhythm. John Otto on drums and Sam Rivers on bass never even tried to get funky, instead steering hip-hop's break-beat-based structure into a backbone for power chords. This makes for a hybrid that would be more interesting if the band did not constantly mire itself in boring tempos, and if Mr. Durst had any talent as a singer".<ref name=Devenish127/>

In the summer of 1999, Limp Bizkit played at the highly anticipated [[Woodstock 1999|Woodstock '99]] show in front of approximately 200,000 people. Violent action sprang up during and after their performance, including fans tearing plywood from the walls during a performance of the song "[[Break Stuff]]". Several [[sexual assault]]s were reported in the aftermath of the concert.<ref name=Devenish127/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/july99/woodstock29.htm |title=Police Investigate Reports of Rapes at Woodstock |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=July 29, 1999 |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref><ref name="amg"/> Durst stated during the concert, "People are getting hurt. Don't let anybody get hurt. But I don't think you should mellow out. That's what [[Alanis Morissette]] had you motherfuckers do. If someone falls, pick 'em up. We already let the negative energy out. Now we wanna let out the positive energy".<ref name=Devenish127/> Durst later stated in an interview, "I didn't see anybody getting hurt. You don't see that. When you're looking out on a sea of people and the stage is twenty feet in the air and you're performing, and you're feeling your music, how do they expect us to see something bad going on?"<ref name=Devenish127/> Les Claypool told the ''San Francisco Examiner'', "Woodstock was just Durst being Durst. His attitude is 'no press is bad press', so he brings it on himself. He wallows in it. Still, he's a great guy."<ref name=Devenish127/>

Durst saw the band as being scapegoated for the event's controversy, and reflected on the criticisms surrounding the band in his music video for the single "Re-Arranged", which depicted the band members receiving death sentences for their participation in the concerts. The video ended with angry witnesses watching as the band drowning in milk while performing the song.<ref name=Devenish127/> Durst later stated that the promoters of Woodstock '99 were at fault for booking his band, due to their reputation for raucous performances.<ref name=Devenish127/> Despite this controversy, ''Significant Other'' remained at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' charts, and the band headlined the year's [[Family Values Tour 1999|Family Values Tour]].<ref name=Devenish127/> Durst directed a music video for "N 2 Gether Now" which featured Method Man and [[Pauly Shore]], and was inspired by [[Inspector Clouseau]]'s fights with his butler, Cato Fong, in the ''[[The Pink Panther|Pink Panther]]'' film series.<ref name=Devenish127/>

=== ''Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water'' (2000<U+2013>2001) ===

In 2000, Durst announced that the band's third studio album would be titled ''[[Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water]]''. The press thought he was joking about this title.<ref name=diPerna>{{cite book|last=di Perna |first=Alan |title=Guitar World Presents Nu-Metal |chapter=Wild Wild Wes |page=104 |year=2002 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn=0634032879}}</ref> The album title is intended to sound like a fictional band; the phrase "Chocolate Starfish" referred to Durst himself, as he had frequently been called an asshole.<ref name=diPerna/> Borland contributed the other half of the album's title when the band was standing around at a truck stop, looking at bottles of flavored water, and Borland joked that the truck stop didn't have hot dog or meat-flavored water.<ref name=diPerna/> 

In June 2000, Limp Bizkit performed at the [[WXRK]] [[Dysfunctional Family Picnic]], but showed up an hour late for their set.<ref name=Manning>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427590/limp-creed-trade-barbs-at-krock-show.jhtml |title=Limp, Creed Trade Barbs At KROCK Show |author=Manning, Kara |date=June 26, 2000 |work= |publisher=MTV News |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref> An Interscope spokesman stated that there was confusion over the band's set time.<ref name=Manning/> During the band's performance, Durst criticized [[Creed (band)|Creed]] singer [[Scott Stapp]], calling him "an egomaniac".<ref name=Manning/> Creed's representatives later presented Durst with an autographed anger management manual during a later appearance on ''[[Total Request Live]]''.<ref name=Manning/> In the summer, Limp Bizkit's tour was sponsored by the controversial [[file sharing]] service [[Napster]]. Durst was an outspoken advocate of file sharing.<ref name="amg"/>

During the 2000 [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, Durst performed a song from the upcoming album, "Livin' It Up", as a duet with [[Christina Aguilera]]. In response to the performance, [[Filter (band)|Filter]] frontman [[Richard Patrick]] called Durst a "pop-lovin' piece of frozen dog shit" and claimed that "Fred getting onstage with Christina Aguilera embarrassed us all."<ref name=MTVNewsAguilera/> In response to the negative reactions to the performance, Durst remarked, "I already told you guys before, I did it all for the nookie, man."<ref name=MTVNewsAguilera>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1424786/20001003/aguilera_christina.jhtml |title=Limp's Durst Explains Aguilera Duet |author= |date=October 3 2000 |work= |publisher=MTV News |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref> In response to Durst's remark, Aguilera commented, "He got no nookie."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1424784/20001010/aguilera_christina.jhtml |title=Aguilera Responds To Durst's "Nookie" Comment |author= |date=October 10, 2000 |work= |publisher=MTV News |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref>

Released on October 17, ''Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water'' set a record for highest week-one sales of a rock album with over one million copies sold in the U.S. in its first week of release, with 400,000 of those sales coming on its first day, making it the fastest-selling rock album ever, breaking the record held for 7 years by [[Pearl Jam]]'s ''[[Vs.

=== Departure of Borland, Mike Smith and ''Results May Vary'' (2001<U+2013>2003) ===

In October 2001, Durst released a statement on their website stating that "Limp Bizkit and Wes Borland have amicably decided to part ways. Both Limp Bizkit and Borland will continue to pursue their respective musical careers. Both wish each other the best of luck in all future endeavors."<ref name=CMJ>{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year= |title=Borland bids adieu to Bizkit |journal=CMJ New Music Report |volume=69 |issue=737 |page=6 |publisher=CMJ Network |doi=October 29, 2001 |url= |accessdate= }}</ref> Durst also stated that the band would "comb the world for the illest guitar player known to man" to replace Borland.<ref name=CMJ/> After holding a nationwide audition for a new guitarist, called "Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth Is",<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451596/20011221/story.jhtml "Limp Bizkit Scouring 99 Cities For New Guitarist"].

The album, released on September 23, 2003, received poor reviews,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/limpbizkit/resultsmayvary |title=Results May Vary Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic |publisher=Metacritic.com |date= |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> but peaked at #3 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref name=AllmusicCharts/> Durst later had a falling out with Smith, and told a fan site, "We are the type of people that stay true to our family and our instincts and at any moment will act on intuition as a whole. Mike wasn't the guy. We had fun playing with him but always knew, in the back of our minds, that he wasn't where we needed him to be mentally."<ref name=DAngelo/>

=== Borland's return, ''The Unquestionable Truth Pt. 1'' and hiatus (2004-2008) ===

In August 2004, Borland rejoined Limp Bizkit, which began recording another album, ''[[The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)]]''.<ref name=DAngelo>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1490229/wes-borland-back-with-limp-bizkit.jhtml |title=Wes Borland Back With Limp Bizkit |author=D'Angelo, Joe |date=August 16 2004 |work= |publisher=MTV News |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref> In March 2005, Limp Bizkit participated on the [[Summer Sanitarium Tour]], headlined by [[Metallica]].<ref>{{cite news |first=James |last=Montgomery |title=Mudvayne Lose The Makeup, Find Inspiration In Isolation |url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1497672/03022005/mudvayne.jhtml |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=March 2, 2005 |accessdate=5 January 2009 }}</ref> At the tour's stop in [[Chicago, IL]], attendees of the concert threw items and heckled Durst from the moment he walked on stage. With the crowd chanting "Fuck Fred Durst" and continuing their assault on him, Durst threw the mic down after six songs and walked off stage, but not before heckling the crowd back.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Gil |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1474912/20030728/limp_bizkit.jhtml |title=Limp Bizkit Walk Offstage After Chicago Crowd Gets Hostile <U+2013> Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV |date=July 28, 2003 |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> An article in the ''Sun-Times'' stated that the hostility was started by radio personality [[Mancow]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Susman |first=Gary |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,471517,00.html |title=Throw Stuff |publisher=EW.com |date=July 29, 2003 |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref>

In May, ''The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)'' was released. [[Sammy Siegler]] took over drumming duties for the band for much of the album. At Durst's insistence, the album was released as an underground album, without any advertising or promotion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1514094/20051118/limp_bizkit.jhtml |title=Music Ruined Wes Borland's Life, So He's Formed A New Band |last1=Harris |first1=Chris |date=November 18, 2005 |work= |publisher=MTV News |accessdate=14 December 2011}}

=== Return and ''Gold Cobra'' (2009 onward) ===

In 2009, the original lineup of Limp Bizkit reunited and began touring. Durst announced that they had begun to record a new album, which would be titled ''[[Gold Cobra]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.kerrang.com/2009/11/world_exclusive_limp_bizkit_na.html |title=World exclusive!

== Style and legacy ==

[[File:Wes Borland.jpg|thumb|Guitarist Wes Borland is known for his visual performance style, and often performs wearing costumes or [[body paint]].]]

=== Music and lyrics ===

Durst wanted Limp Bizkit to be a "megaband" which could cross over into as many different styles of music as possible.<ref name=Devenish21/> Limp Bizkit's music has predominately been described as [[nu metal]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Apter |first1=Jeff |title=Never Enough: The Story of The Cure |year=2009 |publisher=Music Sales Group |isbn=0857120247 |page=468 |chapter= }}</ref> Their music is noted for "kinetic, frenzied energy".<ref name=ErlewineThreeDollarBill/> Otto is adept in drumming in a variety of styles ranging from [[Music of Brazil|Brazilian]] and [[Music_of_Cuba#African_heritage|Afro-Cuban music]] to [[bebop]] and [[funk]].<ref name=Devenish21/> DJ Lethal functions as a [[sound design|sound designer]] for the band, shaping their sound. According to Lethal, "I try and bring new sounds, not just the regular chirping scratching sounds. [...] It's all different stuff that you haven't heard before. I'm trying to be like another guitar player."<ref name=Devenish21/> 

Borland's guitar playing is experimental and nontraditional, and he is noted for his creative use of six and [[seven-string guitar]]s.<ref name=KittsTolinski/> ''Three Dollar Bill, Yall$'' features him playing without a [[guitar pick]], performing with two hands, one playing melodic notes, and the other playing chord progressions.<ref name=Devenish21/> His guitar playing has made use of octave shapes, and choppy, eighth-note rhythms, sometimes accompanied by muting his strings with his left hand, creating a percussive sound.<ref name=HurwitzRiley>{{cite book |last1=Hurwitz |first1=Tobias |authorlink1= |last2=Riley |first2=Glenn |title=7-String Guitar |date=June 1, 2002 |publisher=Alfred Music Publishing |isbn=0739028073 |pages=30-2 |chapter=Rhythm guitar riffs in the style of Wes Borland }}</ref> Borland has also made use of unevenly accented syncopated sixteenth notes to create a disorienting effect, and hypnotic, droning [[Lick (music)|licks]].<ref name=HurwitzRiley/> The song "Stuck" uses a sustain pedal in the first bar, and muted riffs in the second bar.<ref name=HurwitzRiley/>

[[Allmusic]] writer [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] said that their album, ''Significant Other'', contains "flourishes of [[neo-psychedelia]] on pummeling metal numbers" and "swirls of [[Strings (music)|strings]], even [[Crooner|crooning]], at the most unexpected background".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/significant-other-r421388/review |title=''Significant Other'' - Limp Bizkit |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |date= |work= |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref> The band is generally opposed to the use of [[solo (music)|solos]]. However, during the recording of ''Significant Other'', they allowed drummer John Otto to perform an extended solo in the middle of the song "Nobody Like You".<ref name=Devenish95/> 

Durst's lyrics are often profane, scatological or angry.<ref name=ErlewineChocolateStarfish>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/chocolate-starfish-and-the-hot-dog-flavored-water-r500737/review |title=''Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water'' - Limp Bizkit |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |date= |work= |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref><ref name=ErlewineGoldCobra>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/gold-cobra-r2210421/review |title=''Gold Cobra'' - Limp Bizkit |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |date= |work= |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref> Much of Durst's lyrical inspiration came from growing up and his personal life.<ref name=Devenish21/> The song "Sour", from the album ''Three Dollar Bill, Yall$'', was inspired by Durst's problems with his girlfriend.<ref name=Devenish21/> His breakup with her inspired the ''Significant Other'' songs "[[Nookie (song)|Nookie]]" and "[[Re-Arranged]]".<ref name=Devenish79>{{cite book |last1=Devenish |first1=Colin |title=Limp Bizkit |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's |isbn=031226349X |pages=79-95}}</ref> ''The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)'' focuses on darker lyrical subject matter, including [[Catholic sex abuse cases]], [[terrorism]] and fame.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-unquestionable-truth-pt-1-r740966/review |title=''The Unquestionable Truth, Pt. 1'' - Limp Bizkit |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |date= |work= |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref>

=== Live performances ===

Borland is known for performing in costumes and [[body paint]] during concerts, appearing in bunny and kung fu suits,<ref name=Devenish21/> and painted as a skeleton and what he describes as a "burnt match". Describing the character, he stated, "I go onstage wearing almost nothing. I have underwear and my boots on, and I paint my whole head black<U+2014>from the neck up<U+2014>and I have the black contacts. All you can see is these glowing teeth."<ref name=KittsTolinski>{{cite book |last1=Kitts |first1=Jeff |last2=Tolinski |first2=Brad |title=The 100 Greatest Guitarists Of All Time |year=2002 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn=0634046195 |pages=3-4 |chapter=Lords Of Hard Rock: Wes Borland }}</ref> Borland's black contacts were customized for him by a company noted for making contacts for the [[science fiction]] TV series ''[[Babylon 5]]''.<ref name=KittsTolinski/> 

In addition to Borland's visual appearance, the band has also used elaborate stage setups in their performances. Their Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour visually paid tribute to the film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', with an elaborate stage setup which featured an empty Jeep, camouflage mesh and palm trees.<ref name=Devenish51/> During the band's tour with Primus, Limp Bizkit took inspiration from Primus' trademark self-deprecatory slogan "Primus sucks": Durst, Borland, Rivers, Otto and Lethal took the stage with [[the finger|middle fingers]] raised. According to Borland, "they finger us back <U+2014> and you know what that means to us <U+2014> that they love us. It's kind of like saying something is bad when you really mean good. Les Claypool came out the first night of the tour and got a big kick out of it. We figured it was the right idea. It makes hecklers go 'huh.'"<ref name=Devenish51/> During the band's sets at Ozzfest, audience members at the tour heckled Limp Bizkit, leading the band to use a 30 foot toilet as a stage prop, which they would emerge from during each performance; the band punctuated their sets by "flushing" cardboard cutouts of [[pop music|pop]] stars like [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]] and the [[Spice Girls]].<ref name=Devenish51/> During their appearance at the first [[Family Values Tour]], Limp Bizkit performed on a set which the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described as "a mix of ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' and ''[[Mars Attacks!|Mars Attacks]]''". The band emerged from a spaceship during the tour, and Borland continued to experiment with visual appearances.<ref name=Devenish51/> During the band's [[Halloween]] performance on the tour, each of the band's members dressed as [[Elvis Presley]] at various stages in his career.<ref name=Devenish51/>
