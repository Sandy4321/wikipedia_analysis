On the morning of August 13, 2006, an argument between Studebaker and her husband, Sam, began over the amount of time Studebaker was spending on the campaign. Her husband claimed that she was not spending enough time with their two young daughters, who were present during the incident. According to the sheriff report, Studebaker claimed that Sam proceeded to mock her political aspirations, threatened to take their children, and then pushed her and struck her shoulders and arms.

The sheriff's department became involved when it received almost simultaneous calls from Studebaker and her father-in-law.  The father-in-law had become involved after receiving a call from his son during the escalation of the incident.  When the deputies arrived, they were unable to determine who was at fault, as Sam had marks on his right upper arm and back. Both spouses were therefore taken into custody, and each was released later that day on a $25,000 bond. [http://www.daytondailynews.com/localnews/content/localnews/daily/081506studebaker.html]. The legal case ended when the parties involved chose not to press charges. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

On Friday, August 18, 2006, Sam Studebaker filed for divorce in the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court. [http://www.daytondailynews.com/search/content/localnews/daily/082106notebook.html]

===Political consequences===
On August 15, 2006, Studebaker released the following statement: "After deciding to focus my efforts entirely on my family, I am withdrawing my name from the ballot as a candidate for Ohio's Third Congressional District, effective immediately.  Ohio families are ready for a change, and this is a seat Democrats can and will win in November." [http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/content/shared-gen/ap/House_Elections/Candidate_Arrested.html]

A special primary election to fill the vacancy caused by Studebaker's resignation was held on September 15, 2006.  Initially four candidates announced their intentions to run in the special primary: [[Jane Mitakides]], the 2004 Democratic Nominee for the seat; [[Charles W. Sanders]], a former mayor of [[Waynesville, Ohio]]; Roosevelt Chapman, an educator; and [[J. Richard Chema]], a former Assistant US Attorney.  Mitakides and Chapman dropped out with Mitakides endorsing Chema. [http://www.daytondailynews.com/n/content/oh/story/news/local/ddn082506janeweb.html]   Sanders was the runner up to Studebaker in the May 2 primary. [http://www.sos.state.oh.us/SOS/ElectionsVoter/results2006.aspx?Section=1700] Richard Chema then won the primary but then lost the congressional election.
