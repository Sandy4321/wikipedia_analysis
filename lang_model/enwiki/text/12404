'''''Plastic Beach''''' is the third [[studio album]] by English virtual band [[Gorillaz]], released 3 March 2010 on [[Parlophone]] and [[Virgin Records]]. Conceived from an unfinished Gorillaz project called ''Carousel'', the album was recorded during June 2008 to November 2009 and produced primarily by group co-creator [[Damon Albarn]]. It features guest appearances by several artists, including [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Gruff Rhys]], [[Bobby Womack]], [[Mos Def]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]], [[Mark E. Smith]], [[Paul Simonon]], [[Kano (rapper)|Kano]], and the [[Hypnotic Brass Ensemble]].

The album debuted at number two on the [[UK Albums Chart]], selling 74,000 copies in its first week. In the United States, it debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 112,000 copies, and it also charted within the top-ten in several other countries. Upon its release, ''Plastic Beach'' received generally positive reviews from most music critics.

==Background==
===''Carousel''===
Creators of Gorillaz, musician [[Damon Albarn]] and artist [[Jamie Hewlett]], began working on a new Gorillaz project in November 2007 called ''Carousel'',<ref name="Q 2007" /> which evolved into ''Plastic Beach'', the group's third studio album.<ref name="guardian 2009">{{cite news |title = Paul Morley's Showing Off...

Those were presented as by 'The Who' even though none of the members of the band were in the movies. I don't think anyone from The Who was in ''Quadrophenia''. But it's the same people working on it, that's the principle."<ref name="Hewlett 2008 Interview">{{cite web |url = http://gorillaz-unofficial.com/Jamie08/jamie.html |title = Jamie Hewlett: The Gorillaz-Unofficial 2008 Interview |accessdate = 5 October 2008 |date = February 2008 |work = Gorillaz-Unofficial |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mqx5KHTW |archivedate = 17 January 2010}}</ref> In a July 2008 interview with ''[[The Observer]]'' he also said, "Gorillaz now to us is not like four animated characters any more&nbsp;<U+2014> it's more like an organisation of people doing new projects. [...] That's my ideal model&nbsp;<U+2014> Gorillaz is a group of people who gave you this, and now want to give you new stuff."<ref name="Observer 2008">{{cite web |url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2008/jul/20/art |title = The year of the monkey |accessdate = 5 October 2008 |last = Kermode |first = Mark |date = 20 July 2008 |work = [[The Observer]] |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5my1cqY65 |archivedate = 22 January 2010}}</ref>

In the ''Observer'' interview, Hewlett said that there is "a new project which Damon and I are working on now, called Carousel, which is even bigger and more difficult than ''[[Monkey: Journey to the West|Monkey]]'', and it isn't going to fit anywhere and no one's going to like it, ha ha ha! We've started work&nbsp;<U+2014> I've done a lot of visuals and Damon's done a lot of music but we haven't figured out how they're going to fit together. I can't say much about it yet but it's sort of like a film, but not with one narrative story. There's many stories, told around a bigger story, set to music, and done in live action, animation, all different styles, well... originally it was a film but now we think it's a film and it's a stage thing as well and... look, it's basically us doing what the fuck we want without worrying about whether it's for a record company or a film company or whatever. So I'm not sure how it'll pan out, or even if it will happen. But Damon's written around 70 songs for it, and I've got great plans for the visuals, but right now, at this moment, it's still just a really good idea."<ref name="Observer 2008" /> ''Carousel'' was to be about the mystical aspects of Britain.<ref name="guardian 2009" />

===Concept===
Damon Albarn got the idea for ''Plastic Beach'' while on a beach next to his house: "I was just looking for all the plastic within the sand", he said.<ref name="guardian 2009" /> On 17 September 2008, Albarn and Jamie Hewlett announced that they would be doing another Gorillaz album in an interview with [[CBC News]].<ref name=CBC>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2008/09/17/f-albarn-hewlett-monkey.html |title=Simian city |accessdate=10 January 2010 |last=Liss |first=Sarah |date=17 September 2008 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5my1k7zcN |archivedate = 22 January 2010}}</ref> Hewlett said that from their work on ''Monkey'', "we just learned more about what we do, musically and artistically. That's a great place to come at when we come to another Gorillaz album. It doesn't have to be animation and music".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/theampersand/archive/2008/09/22/gorillaz-monkey-around-damon-albarn-and-jamie-hewlett-on-their-new-album.aspx |title = Gorillaz Monkey around: Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett on their new album |accessdate = 5 October 2008 |last = Frenette |first=Brad |date = 22 September 2008 |work = [[National Post]] |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5my1XyBOY |archivedate = 22 January 2010 }}</ref> Hewlett also expressed annoyance at having to draw the band members again: "I'm so fucking bored of drawing those characters. But then we had a moment where we had a new angle on it... I'm gonna adapt them".<ref name=CBC/> In a later interview Hewlett said: "they'll be the same characters, but a little bit older and told in a different way".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/monkey-business-artist-jamie-hewlett-reveals-how-he-created-his-antihero-997071.html |title=Monkey business: Artist Jamie Hewlett reveals how he created his anti-hero |accessdate=23 December 2008 |last=Birrell |first=Ian |date=7 November 2008 |work = [[The Independent]] |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5my254OFa |archivedate = 22 January 2010}}</ref>

Albarn said in September 2008 that he wanted "to work with an incredibly eclectic, surprising cast of people".<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/504003 |title = Gorillaz pair collaborates on Mandarin-language opera |accessdate = 5 October 2008 |last = Rayner |first=Ben |date = 23 September 2008 |work = [[Toronto Star]] |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mxyKQAES |archivedate = 22 January 2010 }}</ref> As with previous Gorillaz albums, ''Plastic Beach'' features a number of collaborations with other musicians and music groups.

==Recording==
Albarn began recording material for a new Gorillaz album around June 2008.<ref name="nme jan2010">{{cite journal |first = Paul |last = Stokes |date = 23 January 2010 |title = Unfinished monkey business |journal = [[NME]] |pages = 6<U+2013>7 |accessdate = 21 January 2010 }}</ref> He travelled to [[Beirut]] in March 2009 to record with the National Orchestra for Oriental Arabic Music.<ref name="q2010">{{cite journal |first = Johnny |last = Davis |month = March |year = 2010 |title = Yo Ho Ho |journal = [[Q (magazine)|Q]] |issue = 284 |pages = 44<U+2013>52 |publisher = [[Bauer Media Group]] |accessdate = 31 January 2010 }}</ref> The following month, he recorded with [[Derby]]-based orchestra sinfonia ViVa.<ref name="q2010" /> [[Grime (music)|Grime]] rappers Kano and Bashy, who feature on "White Flag", both had the flu during recording. Kano said "We weren't feeling great, the music was out of our comfort zone, it could have been a complete disaster".<ref name="q2010" /> Bobby Womack knew nothing about Gorillaz and was initially unsure about the collaboration, however, his daughter liked Gorillaz and convinced him to do it.<ref>{{cite news |title = Gorillaz Attempt to Draft Bobby Womack For Upcoming Album |first = Andy |last = Greene |url = http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/04/09/gorillaz-attempt-to-draft-bobby-womack-for-upcoming-album/ |work = [[Rolling Stone]] |date = 9 April 2009 |accessdate = 22 January 2010 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mxwTXJIW |archivedate = 22 January 2010 }}</ref> Womack was told to sing whatever was on his mind during the recording of "Stylo". "I was in there for an hour going crazy about love and politics, getting it off my chest", said Womack.<ref name="q2010" /> After an hour of recording, Womack, a [[diabetic]], started to pass out. He was sat down and given a banana, before waking up minutes later.<ref name="q2010" /> "Sweepstakes", the first song Mos Def recorded with Gorillaz,<ref name="semtex mosdef">{{cite video |people = [[DJ Semtex]] (interviewer); [[Mos Def]] (musician) |date = 11 December 2009 |title = 50 Cent & Mos Def Drop In On Semtex |url = http://vimeo.com/8200106 |work = Hip Hop With Semtex |publisher = BBC Radio 1Xtra |accessdate = 22 January 2010 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5nBeZkIlh |archivedate = 31 January 2010 }}</ref> was done in one take.<ref name="q2010" /> Mos Def described the song as "one of the greatest things as an MC that I've ever done".<ref name="semtex mosdef" /> Mick Jones and Paul Simonon completed their portion of the title track "Plastic Beach" in a day.<ref name="q2010" />

Several musicians who collaborated on songs for the album did not end up having all or any of their songs appear on the final album; some guests announced to have collaborated with the band do not feature on the album. British [[garage rock]] band [[The Horrors]] were invited to play on the album after Albarn heard their 2009 album ''[[Primary Colours (album)|Primary Colours]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/gorillaz/47069 |title=Damon Albarn enlists The Horrors for new Gorillaz album |date=1 September 2009 |work= [[NME]] |accessdate=17 January 2010 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5my1syGni |archivedate = 22 January 2010}}</ref> They recorded a track with Albarn,<ref>{{cite video |people = Mar, Pete (interviewer); Furse, Tomethy (band member); Webb, Spider (band member) |date =14 June 2009 |title = The Horrors Interview with B-Sides |url = http://bsides.myx.tv/artist-spotlight-the-horrors |format = flv |publisher = B-Sides |accessdate = 14 June 2009 }}</ref> but no songs with the band appear on the final album. In an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', [[Kelvin Mercer|Posdnuos]] of [[De La Soul]] said that the group had provided vocals on two songs for the album, "Electric Shock" and "Sloped Tropics".<ref name="Posdnuos">{{cite web |url = http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/05/de-la-nike.html |title = De La Soul's Posdnuos on their Nike mix, their next album, and working again with Gorillaz |accessdate = 29 May 2009 |last = Vozick-Levinson |first=Simon |date = 28 May 2009 |work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5my2Cslzb |archivedate = 22 January 2010}}</ref> De La Soul only features on one song on the album, titled "[[Superfast Jellyfish]]". [[Gruff Rhys]] recorded two songs&nbsp;<U+2014> "Superfast Jellyfish" and "Leviathan". The latter, described by Rhys as "more of a night-time song, a three o'clock in the morning, speeding down the [[autobahn]] evading West German police-type track", does not feature on the album.<ref name="q2010" /> [[Mos Def]] said that he collaborated with Albarn on three songs;<ref name="semtex mosdef" /> however, Def only appears on two songs on the album. Albarn had previously announced that musician [[Barry Gibb]] would feature on the album but Gibb did not turn up to any recording sessions.<ref name="guardian 2009" /> Animated Gorillaz bassist [[Murdoc Niccals|Murdoc]] said the band had collaborated with actress [[Una Stubbs]],<ref name="nme jan2010" /> however, she too does not appear on any of the album's tracks.

==Music==
Albarn said in an interview, "I'm making this one the most [[pop music|pop]] record I've ever made in many ways, but with all my experience to try and at least present something that has got depth."<ref name="guardian 2009" /> He added, "I suppose what I've done with this Gorillaz record is I've tried to connect pop sensibility with ... trying to make people understand the essential melancholy of buying a ready made meal in loads of plastic packaging. People who watch ''[[The X Factor (UK)|X Factor]]'' might have some emotional connection to these things, this detritus that accompanies what seems to be the most important thing in people's eyes, the celebrity [[voyeurism]]."<ref name="guardian 2009" />

The first time Albarn went to [[Mali]], he was taken to a landfill where he saw people "taking every little bit, a little bit of fabric to the fabric regenerators, or the metal and the cans to the ironsmiths and the aluminium recyclers, and it goes on and by the time you get to the road, they're selling stuff."<ref name="guardian 2009" /> When Albarn went to a landfill outside of London to record the sound of seagulls for the album, he noticed a [[wikt:juxtaposition|juxtaposition]] between the way the two countries dealt with rubbish.<ref name="guardian 2009" /> "They've got more snakes... like adders, grass snakes, slow worms, toads, frogs, newts, all kinds of rodents, all kinds of squirrels, a massive amount of squirrels, a massive amount of foxes, and obviously, seagulls. [...] This is part of the new [[ecology]]. And for the first time I saw the world in a new way. I've always felt, I'm trying to get across on this new record, the idea that plastic, we see it as being against nature but it's come out of nature. We didn't create plastic, nature created plastic. And just seeing the snakes like living in the warmth of decomposing plastic bags. They like it. It was a strange kind of optimism that I felt... but trying to get that into pop music is a challenge, anyway. But important."<ref name="guardian 2009" />

Albarn says the album maintains a lot of the melancholy from ''Carousel''.<ref name="guardian 2009" /> He worked hard on making his lyrics and melodies clear on the album.<ref name="guardian 2009" /> "Loads of orchestral stuff" was recorded but only a fraction made it onto the final album.<ref name="guardian 2009" />

==Release and promotion==

A new picture of the band was published on 9 December 2009 on the cover of the UK edition of [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'' magazine]]. On 14 January 2009, Albarn made an appearance as a guest DJ on [[BBC Radio 1]], premiering demos of three new Gorillaz songs&nbsp;<U+2014> "Electric Shock", "Broken" and "Stylo".<ref name=Newsbeat>{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/music/newsid_7829000/7829878.stm |title = Gorillaz tracks debuted by Damon |accessdate = 17 January 2009 |last = Cochrane |first=Greg |date = 15 January 2009 |work = [[Newsbeat]] |publisher = [[BBC Radio 1]] |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5my25IejA |archivedate = 22 January 2010}}</ref>. "Stylo" went to be heavily edited in its final version, while "Broken" remained mostly unchanged. "Electric Shock" did not make the album, though samples of the song were used in "Rhinestone Eyes", as well as the intro orchestral separated into bonus track "Three Hearts, Seven Seas, Twelve Moons".

On 20 January 2010, the official Gorillaz website was heavily revamped to fit the ''Plastic Beach'' theme. Over a period of time, a numerous amount of short clips were posted on the site, mainly showing various shots of a large Plastic Beach<!-- The place, not the album --> model backed by segments of new Gorillaz music. Out of the 13 short clips, only 2 of the clips had audio that would eventually end up on the album. The tracks were "White Flag" and "Pirate's Progress" (an extended version of the Orchestral Intro found on the album). Also on the website was a countdown timer, which on 23 February 2010 counted down to zero. After a significant delay, a new full Kong studios-esque interactive ''Plastic Beach'' "Beachsite" was uploaded onto the website, opening certain sections of Plastic Beach<!-- The place, not the album --> to be visited by guests.

On 21 January 2010, Gorillaz member Murdoc "took over" [[NME Radio]] and [[Yahoo!]] Radio. He played a 45 minute set of songs while providing exposition on the story of Gorillaz. A total of four broadcasts were uploaded online, leading to the release of the album. All four are now available on the official Gorillaz website.

Short animated "idents" have been released for fictional band members Murdoc, 2D, Russel, and the Noodle cyborg. The first depicts Murdoc fleeing from an unknown, rifle-wielding assailant (featuring a clip of "Three Hearts, Seven Seas, Twelve Moons" in the background), and the second depicts 2D's abduction and transportation to Plastic Beach by a masked figure featuring (with a snippet of the instrumental version of "Rhinestone Eyes"). The track can be found as a bonus track along with "Pirate's Progress" on the iTunes Deluxe edition. Russel's ident has him stomping off of the edge of a pier and diving into the ocean, presumably headed to Plastic Beach for reasons unknown. The fourth feature a zoom in on the cyborg, its face plate open. A fifth ident has been released, showing a luxury cruise sail being bombarded by torpedoes coming from planes flying above it. A crew member rushes over to cabin 13 to warn a passenger, who is revealed to be Noodle (wearing the Oni Mask), that the cruise is under attack by pirates and he was told to escort her to the lifeboats. Noodle then grabs her briefcase and opens it, revealing a gun, and passes the crew member while heading out, presumably to face the pirates. Noodle's ident acts as a trailer to the "On Melancholy Hill" music video, which was released on June 15.

On 26 February 2010, a "minimix" of the album was made available on the official website to download for free.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gorillaz.com/f/album-mix/ |title=Plastic Beach - Album Mixtape 2010 |publisher=Gorillaz |date= |accessdate=28 February 2010}}</ref> The minimix is an eight-minute composition of songs from the album, a number of which had not been previously released.

"Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach", "Rhinestone Eyes" and "White Flag" were premiered on the [[Australian]] [[radio station]] [[Triple J]] on 28 February 2010, in respective order, at one hour intervals. On 1 March 2010, [[National Public Radio|NPR]] debuted the entire album via streaming.<ref>{{cite web|author=Daniel Kreps |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2010/02/26/gorillaz-debut-new-plastic-beach-track-superfast-jellyfish/ |title=Gorillaz Debut New <U+201C>Plastic Beach<U+201D> Track <U+201C>Superfast Jellyfish<U+201D> : Rolling Stone : Rock and Roll Daily |publisher=Rolling Stone |date= |accessdate=28 February 2010}}</ref> Later on in the day, the album also become available for streaming at [[Guardian.co.uk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2010/mar/01/gorillaz-plastic-beach|title=Gorillaz - Plastic Beach: Exclusive album preview | Music | guardian.co.uk |date=1 March 2010 |work=guardian.co.uk |publisher= Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=10 March 2010}}</ref>
