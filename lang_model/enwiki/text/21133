The '''Kingdom of Cambodia''' (for various names in the [[Khmer language]], see [[Cambodia#Naming|below]]) is a country in [[Southeast Asia]] with a population of more than 13 million. Cambodia is the [[successor state]] of the once powerful [[Khmer empire|Khmer Empire]], which ruled most of the [[Indochina|Indochinese Peninsula]] between the 11th and 14th centuries.

A citizen of Cambodia is usually identified as "Cambodian". "Khmer", which strictly only refers to [[Khmer people|ethnic Khmers]], is also used. Most Cambodians are [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhists]] of Khmer extraction, but the country also has a substantial number of predominantly [[Muslim]] [[Cham people|Cham]], as well as small hill tribes. 

The country shares a border with [[Thailand]] to its west and north, with [[Laos]] to its northeast, and with [[Vietnam]] to its east. In the south it faces the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. The geography of Cambodia is dominated by the [[Mekong]] river (colloquial [[Khmer language|Khmer]]: ''Tonle Thom'' or "the great river") and the [[Tonle Sap Lake|Tonle Sap]] ("the fresh water river"), an important source of fish. 

==Naming== 
''Cambodia'' is the traditional [[English language|English]] [[transliteration]], taken from the [[French language|French]] ''Cambodge'', while ''Kampuchea'' is the direct transliteration, more faithful to the Khmer pronunciation.  The [[Khmer language|Khmer]] ''Kampuchea'' is derived from the ancient Khmer kingdom of [[Kambuja]] (''Kambujadesa'').  Kambuja or [[Kamboja]] is the ancient Sanskrit name of the [[Kambojas]], an early tribe of north [[India]], named after their founder [[Kambu Svayambhuva]], believed to be a variant of [[Cambyses]]. See [[Etymology of Kamboja]].

The official name of the country in Khmer is, in the [[Khmer alphabet#Styles|Khmer Mul script]] [[Image:Cambodia5.png|150px]] ([[Khmer alphabet#Styles|regular script]] [[Image:Cambodia3.png|130px]]), ''Preahreachanach<U+00E2>k Kampuchea'', meaning "Kingdom of Cambodia". The etymology of ''Preahreachanach<U+00E2>k'' is: ''Preah-'' ("sacred"); ''-reach-'' ("king, royal, realm", from Sanskrit); ''-ana-'' (from [[P<U+0101>li|Pali]] ''{{IPA|<U+0101><U+1E47><U+0101>}}'', "authority, command, power", itself from Sanskrit ''{{IPA|<U+0101>j<U+00F1><U+0101>}}'', same meaning) ''-ch<U+00E2>k'' (from Sanskrit ''cakra'', meaning "wheel", a symbol of power and rule).

The name used on formal occassions such as political speeches and news programs is [[Image:Cambodia4.png|100px]] (regular script [[Image:Cambodia1.png|80px]]), ''Pr<U+00E2>teh Kampuchea'', literally "the Country of Cambodia". ''Pr<U+00E2>teh'' is a formal word meaning "country".   

The informal and colloquial name most used by Khmer people, is [[Image:Cambodia2.png|55px]], ''Srok Khmae'', literally "the Khmer Land". ''Khmer'' is spelled with a final "r" in the Khmer alphabet, but this "r" is not pronounced in standard Khmer; final "r" disappeared from most dialects of Khmer pronunciation in the 19th century. ''Srok'' is a [[Mon-Khmer]] word and considered more colloquial than ''pr<U+00E2>teh'', but both words are roughly equal in meaning.

Since independence, the official name of Cambodia has changed several times, following the troubled history of the country. The following names have been used in English and French since 1953.
[[Image:Postagestamp-etat du cambodge-remise armes.jpg|thumb|1993 stamp showing the name ''<U+00C9>tat du Cambodge'']]
*''Kingdom of Cambodia''/''Royaume du Cambodge'' under the rule of the monarchy from 1953 through 1970;
*''Khmer Republic''/''R<U+00E9>publique Khm<U+00E8>re'' (a [[calque]] of [[French Republic]]) under the [[Lon Nol]] led government from 1970 to 1975;
*''Democratic Kampuchea''/''Kampuchea d<U+00E9>mocratique'' under the rule of the communist [[Khmer Rouge]] from 1975 to 1979;
*''People's Republic of Kampuchea''/''R<U+00E9>publique populaire du Kampuchea'' (a calque of [[People's Republic of China]]) under the rule of the Vietnamese-sponsored government from 1979 to 1989;
*''State of Cambodia''/''<U+00C9>tat du Cambodge'' (a neutral name, while deciding whether to return to monarchy) under the rule of the United Nations transitional authority from 1989 to 1993;
*''Kingdom of Cambodia''/''Royaume du Cambodge'' (return to the pre-1970's name) used after the restoration of the monarchy in 1993.

==History==
[[Image:Bayon Angkor Relief1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] army going to war against the [[Champa|Cham]], from a relief on the [[Bayon]].]]{{main|History of Cambodia}}

The first advanced civilizations in present day Cambodia appeared in the [[1st millennium]] [[Anno Domini|AD]]. During the [[third century|3rd]], [[fourth century|4th]], and [[fifth century|5th]] centuries AD the Indianized states of [[Funan]] and [[Chenla]] coalesced in what is now present-day Cambodia and southwestern Vietnam. These states, which are assumed by most scholars to have been Khmer,<ref name="CS">[http://www.country-studies.com/cambodia/early-indianized-kingdom-of-funan.html Country-Studies.com information taken from US Dept of the Army ''Country Studies Handbook''; accessed July 25, 2006]</ref> had close relations with [[China]] and [[India]].<ref name="BRIT">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-52477 Britannica.com History of Cambodia; accessed July 25, 2006]</ref> Their collapse was followed by the rise of the [[Khmer Empire]], a civilization which flourished in the area from the [[ninth century|9th century]] to the [[thirteenth century|13th century]].

Though declining after this period, the [[Khmer Empire]] remained powerful in the region until the [[15th century]]. The empire's center of power was [[Angkor]], where a series of capitals was constructed during the empire's zenith. [[Angkor Wat]], the main religious temple at the site, is a symbolic reminder of Cambodia's past as a major regional power.

After a long series of wars with neighboring kingdoms, Angkor was sacked by the [[Thai people|Thai]] and abondoned in 1432. The court moved the capital to [[Lovek]] where the kingdom sought to regain its glory through maritime trade.  The attempt was short-lived, however, as continued wars with the Thai and [[Vietnam|Vietnamese]] resulted in the loss of more territory and the conquering of Lovek in 1594. The Khmer kingdom, during the next three centuries, alternated as a vassal state of the Thai and Vietnamese kings, with short-lived periods of relative indepenence between.

In 1863 King Norodom, who had been installed by Thailand,<ref name="CHANDLER">{{cite book | last = Chandler | first = D.P. | authorlink = William Shawcross | title = A history of Cambodia (2nd ed.) | publisher = Westview Press | date = 1993 | location = Boulder, CO }}</ref> sought the protection of France.  In 1867, the Thai king signed a treaty with France, renouncing suzerainty over Cambodia in exchange for the control of Batdambang and Siem Reap Provinces which officially became part of Thailand. The provinces were ceded back to Cambodia by a border treaty between France and Thailand in 1906.

During the colonial period, Cambodia was a [[protectorate]] of [[France]] from 1863 to 1953.  It was administered as part of the French [[colony]] of [[Indochina]]. After war-time occupation by the [[Japanese empire]] from 1941 to 1945, Cambodia gained independence from France in November [[1953]]. It become a constitutional monarchy under [[Norodom Sihanouk|King Norodom Sihanouk]].  

Sihanouk quickly abdicated in favor of his father in order to be elected Prime Minister. Upon his father's death in 1960, Sihanouk again became head of state, taking the title of Prince.  As the [[Vietnam War]] progressed, Sihanouk ruled Cambodia with an official policy of [[Neutral country|neutrality]] until [[Cambodian coup of 1970|ousted]] by a military [[coup d'etat|coup]] led by Prime Minister General [[Lon Nol]] in 1970. From [[Bejing]], Sihanouk realigned himself with the [[communist]] [[Khmer Rouge]] rebels who had been slowly gaining territory in the remote mountain regions and urged his followers to help in overthowing the pro-[[United States]] government of Lon Nol, hastening the onset of [[Cambodian Civil War|civil war]].<ref name="SIHNK">{{cite book | last = Sihanouk | first = Norodom | authorlink = Norodom Sihanouk | title = My War with the CIA, The Memoirs of Prince Norodom Sihanouk as related to Wilfred Burchett | publisher = Pantheon Books | date = 1973}}</ref>

The bombing continued and, as the Cambodian communists began gaining ground, eventually included strikes on suspected Khmer Rouge sites until halted in 1973.

==Politics==

{{main|Politics of Cambodia}}
[[Image:Seihamuni.jpg|thumb|200px|The current King of Cambodia, HM [[Norodom Sihamoni]]]]
The politics of Cambodia formally take place, according to the nation's [[constitution]] of 1993, in the framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]], [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[monarchy]]. The [[Prime Minister of Cambodia]] is the [[head of government]], and of a pluriform multi-party system, while the [[King of Cambodia|king]] is the [[head of state]]. The Prime Minister is appointed by the King, on the advice and with the approval of the [[National Assembly of Cambodia|National Assembly]]; the Prime Minister and his or her ministerial appointees exercise [[executive power]] in government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the executive and the two chambers of parliament, the [[National Assembly of Cambodia]] and the [[Senate of Cambodia|Senate]].

On [[October 14]], [[2004]], King [[Norodom Sihamoni]] was selected by a special nine-member throne council, part of a selection process that was quickly put in place after the surprise abdication of King Norodom Sihanouk a week before. Sihamoni's selection was endorsed by Prime Minister [[Hun Sen]] and National Assembly Speaker Prince [[Norodom Ranariddh]] (the new king's brother), both members of the throne council. He was crowned in Phnom Penh on [[October 29]].  The monarchy is symbolic and does not exercise political power.  Norodom Sihamoni was trained in Cambodian classical dance and is unmarried.

[[Image:Cambodia sm04.png|right|thumb|300px|Map of Cambodia]]

Cambodia is divided into 20 [[province]]s (''khett'', singular and plural) and 4 municipalities (''krong'', singular and plural). Cambodia is further subdivided into [[district]]s (srok), communions (khum), great districts (khett), and also islands (koh).

==Foreign relations==
{{main|Foreign relations of Cambodia}}

Cambodia has [[diplomatic relations]] with most countries and is a member of most major international organizations, including the [[United Nations]] and its specialized agencies such as the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]]. Cambodia is an [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB) member, a member of [[ASEAN]], and joined the [[WTO]] on [[13 October]] [[2004]].  In 2005 Cambodia attended the inaugural [[East Asia Summit]].

The country has several [[border dispute]]s with its neighbours, including disagreements over some offshore islands and sections of the boundary with [[Vietnam]], and undefined maritime boundaries and border areas with [[Thailand]].

In January 2003, there were [[2003 Phnom Penh riots|riots in Phnom Penh]] prompted by rumored comments about [[Angkor Wat]] by a Thai actress wrongly attributed by Reaksmei Angkor, a Cambodian newspaper, and later quoted by Prime Minister [[Hun Sen]].<ref name="USDOS2">[http://www.state.gov/p/eap/rls/rpt/20565.htm ''Report to the Congress on the Anti-Thai Riots in Cambodia on January 29, 2003'', Released by the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs of the US Department of State]</ref> The Thai government sent military aircraft to evacuate Thai nationals and closed its border with Cambodia while Thais demonstrated outside the Cambodian embassy in [[Bangkok]]. The border was re-opened on [[March 21]], after the Cambodian government paid $6 million [[USD]] in compensation for the destruction of the Thai embassy and agreed to compensate individual Thai businesses for their losses.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Cambodia}}
[[Image:Phnom_Penh_Climate.png|right|thumb|400px|Climate of Phnom Penh]]

Cambodia has an area of about 181,040 [[square kilometer]]s (69,900&nbsp;[[square mile|sq.&nbsp;mi]]), sharing an 800&nbsp;[[kilometer]] (500&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) border with [[Thailand]] on the north and west, a 541&nbsp;kilometer (336&nbsp;mi) border with [[Laos]] on the northeast, and a 1,228&nbsp;kilometer (763&nbsp;mi) border with [[Vietnam]] on the east and southeast. It has 443&nbsp;kilometers (275&nbsp;mi) of coastline along the [[Gulf of Thailand]].

The most distinctive geographical feature is the [[lacustrine plain]] formed by the inundations of the [[Tonle Sap]] (Great Lake), measuring about 2,590 square kilometers (1,000&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;mi) during the dry season and expanding to about 24,605 square kilometers (9,500&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;mi) during the rainy season. This densely populated plain, which is devoted to wet rice cultivation, is the heartland of Cambodia. Most (about 75%) of the country lies at elevations of less than 100 [[meter]]s (330&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) above sea level, the exceptions being the [[Cardamom Mountains]] (highest elevation 1,813&nbsp;m&nbsp;/&nbsp;5,948&nbsp;ft) and their southeast extension the [[D<U+00E2>mrei Mountains]] ("Elephant Mountains") (elevation range 500-1,000&nbsp;m or 1,640&ndash;3,280&nbsp;ft), as well the steep escarpment of the [[D<U+00E2>ngr<U+00EA>k Mountains]] (average elevation 500&nbsp;m&nbsp;/&nbsp;1,640&nbsp;ft) along the border with Thailand's [[Isan]] region. The highest elevation of Cambodia is [[Phnom Aoral]], near [[Pursat]] in the center of the country, at 1,813 meters (5,948 feet) above sea-level.

Temperatures range from 10<U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]] to 38<U+00B0>C (50<U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]]&ndash;100<U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]]) and Cambodia experiences tropical [[monsoon]]s. Southwest monsoons blow inland bringing moisture-laden winds from the Gulf of Thailand and [[Indian Ocean]] from May to October, and the country experiences the heaviest precipitation from September to October. The northeast monsoon ushers in the dry season, which lasts from November to March, with the driest period from January to February.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Cambodia}}

Despite recent progress, the Cambodian economy continues to suffer from the effects of decades of [[civil war]], internal strife and rampant corruption. The [[per capita income]] is rapidly increasing, but is low compared with other countries in the region. Most rural households depend on [[agriculture]] and its related sub-sectors. [[Rice]], [[fish]], [[timber]], [[garments]] and [[rubber]] are Cambodia's major exports, and the [[United States]], [[Singapore]], [[Japan]], [[Thailand]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] are its major export partners.

The recovery of Cambodia's economy slowed dramatically in 1997-1998 due to the [[Asian financial crisis|regional economic crisis]], civil violence, and political infighting. [[Foreign Direct Investment|Foreign investment]] and [[tourism]] also fell off drastically. Since then however, growth has been steady. In 1999, the first full year of peace in 30 years, progress was made on economic reforms and [[economic growth|growth]] resumed at 5.0%. Despite severe flooding, GDP grew at 5.0% in 2000, 6.3% in 2001, and 5.2% in 2002. [[Tourism]] was Cambodia's fastest growing industry, with arrivals increasing from 219,000 in 1997 to 1,055,000 in 2004. During 2003 and 2004 the growth rate remained steady at 5.0%, while in 2004 inflation was at 1.7% and exports at $1.6 billion [[United States Dollar|US dollars]]. As of 2005, [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per Capita was $2,200 [[USD]], which ranked it 178th (out of 233) countries.<ref name="CIARANK">[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html CIA Factbook GDP per Capita rankings; accessed July 24, 2006]</ref>

The population lacks education and productive skills, particularly in the poverty-ridden countryside, which suffers from an almost total lack of basic [[infrastructure]]. Fear of renewed political instability and corruption within the government discourage foreign investment and delay foreign aid. The government is addressing these issues with assistance from bilateral and multilateral donors.{{cite needed}}

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Cambodia}}
[[Image:Cambodia-demography.png|thumb|300px|Number of inhabitants between 1961 and 2001 in thousands. Note the decrease during the Khmer Rouge years (1975-1979). FAO Data,Cambodia]]

Cambodia is ethnically homogeneous. More than 90% of its population is of [[Khmer people|Khmer]] origin and speaks the [[Khmer language]], the country's official language. The remainder include [[Chinese Cambodian|Chinese]], Vietnamese, [[Cham people|Cham]],[[Khmer Loeu]], and [[Indians]].  

The Khmer language is a member of the [[Mon-Khmer]] subfamily of the [[Austroasiatic language]] group. [[French language|French]], once the [[lingua franca]] of [[Indochina]] and still spoken by some, mostly older Cambodians as a second-language, remains the language of instruction in various schools and universities that are often funded by the government of France. [[Cambodian French]], a remnant of the country's colonial past, is a dialect found in Cambodia and is frequently used in government. However, in recent decades, many younger Cambodians and those in the business-class, have favored learning [[English language|English]] which is gradually becoming more widely-spoken.

[[Theravada Buddhism]], suppressed by the Khmer Rouge but now revived, is the dominant religion, but [[Islam]] (5%) and [[Christianity]] (2%) are also practiced.<ref name="USDOS">[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51507.htm ''International Religious Freedom Report 2005'', Released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor of the US Department of State; accessed July 24, 2006]</ref>

Civil war and its aftermath have had a marked effect on the Cambodian population. The median age is a low 20.6 years with 35.6% younger than 15. In the population over 65, the female to male ratio is 1.6:1.<ref name="CIACB">[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/cb.html CIA FactBook; accessed July 25, 2006]</ref> [[UNICEF]] has designated Cambodia the third most [[landmine|mined]] country in the world,<ref name="UNICEF"/> attributing over 60,000 civillian deaths and thousands more maimed or injured since 1970 to the unexploded landmines left behind in rural areas.<ref name="PBSORG"/>  The majority of the victims are children herding animals or playing in the fields.<ref name="UNICEF">[http://www.unicef.org/sowc96/9ldmines.htm UNICEF "The Legacy of Landmines"; accessed July 25, 2006]</ref> Adults that survive landmines often require amputation of one or more limbs and have to resort to begging for survival.<ref name="PBSORG">[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week647/cover.html PBS.org ''Cambodia Land Mines'' July 25, 2003; accessed July 24, 2006]</ref>

==Culture and sport==
{{main|Culture of Cambodia}}
[[Image:Srokkmae.png|thumb|150px|right|"Cambodia" in [[Khmer alphabet|Khmer writing]]]]

Khmer culture, as developed and spread by the [[Khmer empire]], has distinctive styles of dance, architecture and sculpture which have strongly influenced neighbouring [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]]. Notable recent artistic figures include the singers [[Sinn Sisamouth]], who introduced new musical styles to the country, and later [[Meng Keo Pichenda]]. [[Angkor Wat]] (''Angkor'' means "city" and ''Wat'' "temple") is the best preserved example of Khmer architecture from the Angkorian era, although hundreds of other temples have been discovered in and around the region. The  [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]], the infamous prison of the Khmer Rouge, and [[Choeung Ek]], one of the main [[The Killing Fields|Killing Fields]] are other important historic sties.

''Bonn Om Teuk'' (Festival of Boat Racing), the annual boat rowing contest, is the most attended Cambodian national festival. Held at the end of the rainy season when the Mekong river begins to sink back to its normal levels allowing the Tonle Sap River to reverse flow, approximately 10% of Cambodia's population attends this event each year to play games, give thanks to the moon, watch fireworks, and attend the boat race in a carnival-type atmosphere.<ref name="KMGOV">[http://www.cambodia.gov.kh/unisql1/egov/english/news.view.html?doc_oid=@140%7C1%7C1 Government of Cambodia Webpage, ''Bonn Om Touk, the Water and Moon Festivals''; accessed July 24, 2006]</ref> Popular games include [[Cockfight|cockfighting]], [[soccer]], and kicking a ''sey,'' which is similar to a [[hacky sack]].

Rice, as in other South East Asian countries, is the staple grain, while fish from the Mekong and Tonle Sap also form an important part of the diet. The Cambodian per capita supply of fish and fish products for food and trade in 2000 was 20 [[kilogram]]s of fish per year or 2&nbsp;[[avoirdupois|ounces]] per day per person.<ref name="EARTH">[http://earthtrends.wri.org/pdf_library/country_profiles/Coa_cou_116.pdf Earthtrends.org Cambodia Counrtry Profile]</ref> Some of the fish can be made into [[prahok]] (a Khmer delicacy) for longer storage. Overall, the [[cuisine of Cambodia]] is similar to that of its [[Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian]] neighbours. The cuisine is relatively unknown to the world compared to that of its neighbors [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]], but has been described not as spicy as [[Thai cuisine]] and similar to other Southeast Asia cuisines.

Football (soccer) is one of the more popular sports, although professional organized sports are not as prevelant in Cambodia as in western countries due to the economic conditions.  The [[Cambodia national football team]] managed fourth in the [[Asian Cup 1972|1972 Asian Cup]] but development has slowed since the civil war.  Western sports such as volleyball, bodybuilding, field hockey, [[rugby]] and baseball are gaining popularity while traditional boat racing  maintains its appeal as a national sport.  Martial Arts is also practiced in Cambodia, the most popular being [[Pradal Serey]], which is similar to Muay Thai and also considered a national sport. Other styles such as [[Karate]], [[Kung Fu]] and [[Taekwondo]] are rapidly catching on.

The civil war severely damaged the transportation system, despite the provision of [[USSR|Soviet]] technical assistance and equipment. Cambodia has two rail lines, totalling about 612 kilometers (380&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) of single, one&nbsp;[[meter]]&nbsp;gauge track. The lines run from the capital to [[Sihanoukville]] on the southern coast, and from Phnom Penh to [[Sisophon]] (although trains often run only as far as [[Battambang]]). Currently only one passenger train per week operates, between Phnom Penh and Battambang.

The nation's extensive inland waterways were important historically in domestic trade. The [[Mekong]] and the [[Tonle Sap]] River, their numerous tributaries, and the [[Tonle Sap]] provided avenues of considerable length, including 3,700 kilometers (2,300&nbsp;mi) navigable all year by craft drawing 0.6 meters (2&nbsp;ft) and another 282 kilometers (175&nbsp;mi) navigable to craft drawing 1.8 meters (6&nbsp;ft). Cambodia has two major ports, [[Phnom Penh]] and [[Sihanoukville]], and five minor ones. Phnom Penh, located at the junction of the [[Basak River|Basak]], the [[Mekong]], and the [[Tonle Sap]] rivers, is the only [[river port]] capable of receiving 8,000&nbsp;[[ton]] ships during the wet season and 5,000&nbsp;[[ton]] ships during the dry season.

The country possesses six commercial [[airport]]s: [[Pochentong International Airport]] near Phnom Penh is the largest, while the others are at [[Siem Reap]], [[Battambang]], [[Mondulkiri]], [[Ratanakiri]], and [[Stung Treng]].

The locals normally use [[automobile]]s, [[motorbike]]s and [[bus]]es. [[Cycle rickshaw]]s ("cyclos") are an additional option often used by visitors.
