Slayer's musical traits involve fast [[tremolo picking]], atonal [[guitar solo]]s, [[double bass drumming]], and shouting vocals. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as [[serial killers]], [[Satanism]], [[religion]] and [[war]]fare, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and strong criticism from religious groups and the public.

Since their [[Show No Mercy|debut album]] in 1983, the band has released two [[live album]]s, one [[box set]], six [[music video|videos]], two [[extended play]]s, and eleven [[studio album]]s, four of which have received gold [[RIAA certification|certification]] in the United States. The band has received four [[Grammy]] nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song "[[Eyes of the Insane]]", and one in 2008 for the song "Final Six". They have played music festivals worldwide, including [[The Unholy Alliance Tour|Unholy Alliance]], [[Download festival|Download]] and [[Ozzfest]].

==History==
===Early days (1981<U+2013>1982)===
Slayer was founded in 1981, when guitarist [[Kerry King]] met [[Jeff Hanneman]] while auditioning for a band.<ref name="Knac.com interview with Jeff Hanneman">{{cite web|title = Knac.com interview with Jeff Hanneman|author = Davis, Brian |publisher = Knac.com|url = http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=3153|accessdate = 13 December 2006 }}</ref> They recruited bassist and vocalist [[Tom Araya]], who had played with King before in the band Quits (previously known as Tradewinds). Drummer [[Dave Lombardo]] was recruited when he met King while delivering a [[pizza]].<ref name="Drummerworld - Dave Lombardo"/> The band played [[cover version]]s of [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Judas Priest]] songs at clubs and parties in [[Southern California]]. Early shows relied on a [[Satanism|Satanic]] image, which featured [[pentagram]]s, make-up, spikes, and inverted crosses.<ref name="Allmusic Biography of Slayer">{{cite web| title = Allmusic Biography of Slayer| author = Huey, Steve | publisher = Allmusicguide.com| date = | url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:97yvad5kv8w3~T1| accessdate = 10 December 2006 }}</ref> Rumors that the band was originally known as Dragonslayer, after the 1981 movie of the same [[Dragonslayer|name]], were denied by King, as he stated "We never were; it's a myth to this day."<ref name="Kerry King about the Dragonslayer myth, Christ Illusion, previous albums and experimenting">{{cite web

The band was invited to open for [[Bitch (band)|Bitch]] at the Woodstock Club in [[Los Angeles]], performing eight songs <U+2014> six being covers. While playing Iron Maiden's "[[Phantom of the Opera (song)|Phantom of the Opera]]" the band was spotted by [[Brian Slagel]], a former [[music journalist]] who, at the time, recently founded the label [[Metal Blade Records]]. Impressed with Slayer's performance, Slagel met with the band backstage and asked them to record an original song, "Aggressive Perfector" ({{Audio|Aggressive Perfector clip.ogg|sample}}) for his upcoming ''[[Metal Massacre#Metal Massacre III 1983|Metal Massacre III]]'' compilation. The band agreed and the song created underground buzz, which led to Slagel offering the band a [[recording contract]] with Metal Blade.<ref name="INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN SLAGEL">{{cite web|title = Interview with Brian Slagel|author = German, Eric|publisher = Metalupdate.com|url = http://www.metalupdate.com/interviewmetalblade.html|accessdate = 4 December 2006}}</ref>

The album was rushed into release, hitting shelves three weeks after tracks were completed. ''[[Show No Mercy]]'', released in December 1983 by Metal Blade Records, generated underground popularity for the band, and they began their first national club tour in 1984 to promote the album traveling in Araya's [[Camaro]] towing a [[U-Haul]] trailer.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> The tour gave the band additional popularity; sales of ''Show No Mercy'' reached more than 20,000 in the US and another 20,000 worldwide.<ref name="INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN SLAGEL"/>

In August 1984, Slayer released a three song [[extended play|EP]] titled ''[[Haunting the Chapel]]''. The EP featured a darker, more [[thrash metal|thrash]]-oriented style than its predecessor, and laid the groundwork for the future direction of the band.<ref name="Slayer : Haunting the Chapel">{{cite web|title=Slayer:Haunting the Chapel|author=Rivadavia, Eduardo|publisher=Allmusic|url = http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,164341,00.html|accessdate=1 December 2006}}</ref> The opening track, "Chemical Warfare," has become a live staple, played at nearly every show since 1984.

Slayer released its first live [[home video]] in 1985, dubbed ''Combat Tour: The Ultimate Revenge''. The video featured live footage filmed at [[New York]]'s [[Studio 54]] club, on the band's 1984 tour with Venom and Exodus. By early 1985, ''Show No Mercy'' had sold over 40,000 copies,<ref name="INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN SLAGEL"/> which led to the band returning to the studio to record a second full length album. Metal Blade financed a recording budget, which allowed the band to hire producer [[Ron Fair]].<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>

Released in September 1985, Slayer's second full length release ''[[Hell Awaits]]'' expanded on the darkness of ''Haunting the Chapel'', with [[hell]] and [[Satan]] as common song subjects. The album was the band's most [[progressive rock|progressive]] offering, featuring longer and more complex song structures.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> The intro is a [[Backmasking|backwards recording]] of a demonic-sounding voice repeating "Join us," ending with "Welcome back" before the track begins. The album was a hit, with fans choosing Slayer for best band, best live band, ''Hell Awaits'' as 1985's best album, and Dave Lombardo as best drummer in the British magazine ''[[Metal Forces]]''' 1985 Readers Poll.<ref name="Rockdetector Biography - Years 85 to 86">{{cite web

===''Reign in Blood'' (1986<U+2013>1987)===
Following the success of ''Hell Awaits'', Slayer was offered a recording contract with [[Russell Simmons]] and [[Rick Rubin]]'s newly founded [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam Records]], a largely [[hip hop music|rap]]-based label.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> The band accepted and with an experienced producer and [[major label]] recording budget, the band underwent a sonic makeover resulting in shorter, faster songs with clearer production. Gone were the complex arrangements and long songs featured on ''Hell Awaits'', ditched in favor of stripped down, [[thrash metal]] influenced song structures.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>

Def Jam's distributor, [[Columbia Records]], refused to release the album ''[[Reign in Blood]]'' due to its graphic cover art and lyrical themes.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> For example, "[[Angel of Death (song)|Angel of Death]]" detailed [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] [[concentration camp]]s and the [[human experiments]] conducted by Nazi physician [[Josef Mengele]]. The album was distributed by [[Geffen Records]] on October 7, 1986. However, due to the controversy, ''Reign in Blood'' did not appear on Geffen Records<U+2019> release schedule.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> Although the album received virtually no radio airplay, it became the band's first to enter the [[Billboard 200]], debuting at #94,<ref name="Billboard">{{cite web|title=Slayer's album chart history|publisher= Billboard.com|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=5692&model.vnuAlbumId=789249|accessdate=1 December 2006}}</ref> and the band's first album certified gold in the United States.<ref name="RIAA"/>

In October 1986, Slayer embarked on the ''Reign in Pain'' world tour, with [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]] in the US, and [[Malice (metal band)|Malice]] in Europe. The band was added as the opening act on [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]]'s US tour, but just one month in, drummer Lombardo left the band: "I wasn't making any money. I figured if we were gonna be doing this professionally, on a major label, I wanted my rent and utilities paid."<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> To continue with the tour, Slayer enlisted [[Tony Scaglione]] of [[Whiplash (band)|Whiplash]]. However, Lombardo's wife convinced Dave to return in 1987.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> At the insistence of Rubin, Slayer recorded a [[cover version]] of [[Iron Butterfly]]'s "[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (song)|In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida]]" for the film ''[[Less Than Zero (film)|Less Than Zero]]''.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> Although the band was not happy with the final product, Hanneman deeming it "a poor representation of Slayer" and King labeling it "a hunk of shit," it was one of their first songs to garner [[radio airplay]].<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>

===''South of Heaven'' (1988<U+2013>1989)===
Slayer returned to the studio to record their fourth studio album. To contrast the speed of ''Reign in Blood'', the band consciously decided to slow down the [[tempo]]s, and incorporate more melodic singing. According to Hanneman, "We knew we couldn<U+2019>t top ''Reign in Blood'', so we had to slow down. We knew whatever we did was gonna be compared to that album, and I remember we actually discussed slowing down. It was weird<U+2014>we<U+2019>ve never done that on an album, before or since."<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>

When writing new material, the band writes the music before incorporating lyrics. King or Hanneman will use a [[Multitrack recording|24-track]] and [[drum machine]] to show band members the riff they have created, and to get their opinion. Either King, Hanneman or Lombardo will mention if any alterations can be made. The band will play the riff to get the basic song structure, and figure out where the lyrics and solos will be placed.<ref name="Knac.com interview with Jeff Hanneman"/> Hanneman, King and Araya tend to have different lyrical influences. Hanneman's lyrics deal with Nazis, religion, warfare and similar topics. King's lyrics are generally just very anti-religious. Araya's lyrics usually deal with less controversial topics than Hanneman and King such as serial killers and warfare.
