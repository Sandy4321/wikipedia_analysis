The award included this citation:
:In its decision the circle celebrates the advent of the first distinguished fantasy by an American in many years. Imaginative and as comic as it is poetic in both spirit and expression, ''High Tor'' is a singular accomplishment, giving rare grace to this theatrical season in New York.<ref><U+201C>Award of Critics Given to <U+2018>High Tor<U+2019><U+201D>, ''The New York Times'', March 29, 1937, p. 21.</ref>

In 1942, Anderson helped organize and served as the chairman of the Rockland County Committee To Save High Tor, which helped raise money to purchase the property in 1943 for the creation of a public park.<ref>''Dramatist in America'', pp. liv, 126.</ref>

==Television adaptations==
The play was broadcast as an episode of ''[[The Philco Television Playhouse]]'' on [[NBC]], September 10, 1950, with [[Alfred Ryder]] and Felicia Monteleagre in the lead roles.<ref>"Sunday Night Drama", ''The New York Times'', September 10, 1950, p. 109.</ref>

===Musical===
Anderson first considered a musical adaptation of ''High Tor'' for television in 1949.<ref>''Dramatist in America'', p. lxii.</ref> He and [[John Cherry Monks, Jr.|John Monks Jr.]] adapted the play as a made-for-television [[musical film|musical]] fantasy in 1955, with music by [[Arthur Schwartz]] and lyrics by Anderson.  ''High Tor'' was filmed in November 1955 by [[Desilu Productions]] at the [[RKO Pictures|RKO-Path<U+00E9> Studio]],<ref>"Desilu Producing 2 More TV Films", ''The New York Times'', October 19, 1955, p. 67.</ref><ref>"Historic Peak: 'High Tor' Reproduced For TV Presentation", ''The New York Times'', November 27, 1955, p. 153.</ref> and broadcast March 10, 1956 on the [[CBS]] television network, as a 90-minute episode of the series ''[[Ford Star Jubilee]]''. [[Bing Crosby]], [[Julie Andrews]], [[Nancy Olson]], [[Hans Conreid]], and [[Keenan Wynn]] starred in the film, produced by Arthur Schwartz, and directed by [[James Neilson]].

[[Bing Crosby]] had seen [[Julie Andrews]] in her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in ''[[The Boy Friend]]'', and invited her to appear in ''High Tor''.{{Fact|date=January 2009}} It was Andrews' first work in a filmed production, and her American television debut.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000267/ Julie Andrews], at [[Internet Movie Database]].</ref> Because Crosby was uncomfortable with the exigencies of [[live television]], he insisted that it be filmed instead.<ref>Other reasons it was filmed: "''High Tor'' will not be telecast live, the usual form for a large-scale show. It will be produced as a color film, which will permit later theatrical exhibition overseas and this will bring additional revenue to its originators." Oscar Godbout, "Hollywood Notes", ''The New York Times'', September 4, 1955, p. X9. It was actually shot in black and white. "Christmas Can Stay <U+2014> Radio and TV Are for It", ''The Washington Post'', December 11, 1955, p. J3.</ref> For this reason, ''High Tor'' is often considered the first [[TV movie]].

Maxwell Anderson had little interest in television, and considered his adaptation a "[[potboiler|potboiling]] job".<ref>''Dramatist in America'', p. 315.</ref> Julie Andrews later wrote that she thought her performance was "very stilted", and, "Alas, ''High Tor'' was not a memorable piece, and received only lukewarm reviews."<ref>Julie Andrews, ''Home: A Memoir of My Early Years'', Hyperion, 2008, pp. 185<U+2013>186. ISBN 9780786865659.</ref>

The song score of the show, with story narration by Bing Crosby, was released by [[Decca Records]] in 1956.<ref>"Ford Star Jubilee Presents Bing Crosby" (advertisement), ''The Washington Post'', March 10, 1956, p. 47.</ref>

====Plot of the musical version====
Van Van Dorn (Crosby) owns a summit ("High Tor") overlooking the Hudson River in New York. Van Dorn is under pressure to sell his real estate, and, at the same time, is having doubts about his impending marriage to Judith (Olson). Judith leaves him because she feels that he should sell High Tor, as the profits would provide for their future. A freak rock slide traps Van Dorn and the real estate agents on High Tor; as Van searches for help, he meets the spirit of a Dutch girl by the name of Lisa (Andrews). Lisa and the spirits of Dutch sailors have inhabited High Tor for over 300 years since they were killed in a shipwreck. Of course, Lisa falls in love with Van. Songs include "Once Upon a Long Ago", a duet for Crosby and Andrews, "Sad is the Life of a Sailor's Wife", a solo for Andrews, and "When You're in Love".
