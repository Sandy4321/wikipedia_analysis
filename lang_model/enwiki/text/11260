'''Fell running''', also known as '''mountain running''' and '''hill running''', is the sport of [[running]] and racing, off road, over upland country where the gradient climbed is a significant component of the difficulty. The name arises from the origins of the English sport on the [[fell]]s of northern Britain, especially those in the [[Lake District]].

Fell races are organized on the premise that contenders possess mountain [[navigation]] skills (see [[Orienteering]]) and carry adequate survival equipment as prescribed by the organizer. 

==History==
The first recorded hill race took place in Scotland<ref name="smith">Smith, B:  Studmarks on the Summits: A History of Amateur Fell Racing. Preston, 1985</ref>.  King Malcolm Canmore organised a race in Braemar in 1040 or perhaps as late as 1064, reputedly to find a swift messenger. This event appears to have been a precursor to the [[Braemar|Braemar Gathering]]. Little is known of hill and fell running between this single event and the mid-nineteenth century.  By the nineteenth century records begin to appear of fell races taking place as a part of community fairs and games.  The sport was a simple affair and was based upon the community's values for physical ability.  Fell races would take place alongside other sports such as wrestling, sprint races and, especially in Scotland, heavy events such as throwing the hammer. These fairs or games events were often commercial as well as cultural, with livestock shows and sales taking place alongside music, dancing and sports. In a community of shepherds and agricultural labourers comparisons of speed and strength would be interesting to spectators and a source of professional pride for competitors. A fast shepherd or a strong labourer would be as respected, one imagines, as any top ranking colleague in a more modern employment.  The most famous of these events in England is the [[Grasmere]] Sports meeting in the [[Lake District]], with its ''Guide's Race''.  This event still takes place every year in August.  

Early fell races were mostly professional, in that cash prizes were awarded to the winners.  They also attracted bookmakers and gambling.  In the nineteenth century the majority of races were professional, although there were amateur races such as the Hallam Chase in Sheffield<ref name="smith"/>.  The rise of amateur sport in the Victorian era, and the formation of the [[Amateur Athletic Association]] in 1880 brought changes to athletic sports, that would eventually create the modern sport of Fell Running.  The amateur sport developed, in part from the professional, but it also came from a quite different tradition, associated with mountaineering and the Youth Hostel Association.  A formative event in Fell Running history is the [[Lake District Mountain Trial]], inaugurated in 1952.  This long distance, endurance event was the first of a number of more complex and longer courses that make less of a spectacle for spectators but a more modern endurance running sport. Over the next few years more long fell races in lakeland followed, such as Ennerdale (1968) and Wasdale (1972).  While these endurance races emerged, professional racing continued much as before.  Though still under the banner of "professional", at best the prize money would only pay a week<U+2019>s wages. During the major part of the 20th century the two categories ran as separate sports where a runner could only move to the amateur code after withdrawing from competition for a period of quarantine. Professional racing continued, in parallel with amateur events, right up until 1992, when all fell running was declared open <ref>Asquith, R:  Feet in the Clouds.  London, 2004.</ref>. The professional sport has evolved into open fell running and is administered by the [[British Open Fell Runners Association]] (BOFRA) who run regular short-distance events with a strong emphasis on junior races.  

The [[Fell Runners Association]] was inaugurated in April 1970 to organise the duplication of event Calendars for the amateur sport.  It now administers the amateur fell running in England, in affiliation with UK athletics.  Separate governing bodies exist for each country of the United Kingdom and each country has its own tradition of fell running, though the sport is largely the same.  Among the most important races of the year are the [[Ben Nevis]] race in Scotland, run regularly since 1937, and the [[Snowdon]] Race in Wales.  

==Overlap with other sports==
Modern fell running has common characteristics with [[cross country running]]. Courses are often longer, steeper, unmarked when out on the hills (with a few exceptions) and these longer races can demand mountain navigational techniques. Nevertheless, cross country seems fast and furious to many fell runners. Fell running also overlaps with [[orienteering]]. Courses are again longer but demand different techniques from orienteering.{{Fact|date=October 2008}} However, fell running does require navigational skills in a wild, mountainous environment, particularly in [[Route choice (orienteering)|determining and choosing between routes]]. [[#additional categories|Category O]] events and [[Mountain Marathon]]s ([[#additional categories|see also below]]), test navigational ability &mdash; attracting both orienteers and fell runners. Other multi-terrain events, such as the [[Cotswold Way Relay]] and the [[Longmynd hike]] for example, also qualify as fell races under Fell Runners Association rules

==Rocks==
Fell running does not involve [[rock climbing]].<!-- bouldering? --> Races avoid rock climbs and are subject to change when any ground nearby becomes unstable. A small number of fell runners who are also rock climbers nevertheless do attempt records traversing ridges that allow running and involve scrambling and rock climbing &mdash; particularly where the record is 24 [[h]] or less. Foremost of these in the UK is probably the traverse of the [[Cuillin]] Main Ridge on [[Isle of Skye|Skye]], and the Greater Traverse, including [[Blaven]]. Nor does fell running involve expeditions. Race records vary from minutes to, generally, a few hours.  Some of the '''mountain marathons''' do call for pairs of runners to carry equipment and food for [[camping]] overnight. Even the most extreme fell runners will tend to <U+201D>bite<U+201D> at a record that stands 24 h or less &mdash; often a "round" that ends at the start line. The exceptions to the extreme fell runner are attempts at a continuous round of [[Munros]].  [[Mountaineering|Mountaineers]] who traverse light and fast over high Alpine, Himalayan or through other such continental, high altitudes are considered alpine style mountaineers.

==Time and course==
Fell races are generally run annually and over an established sequence of checkpoints.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} A marked route may lead runners from the start onto the open hill and back from the hill to the finish.  Where the route is unmarked, a runner may choose their own route between the ordered checkpoints. Even so, routes between checkpoints tend to be well established for fell runners in fine weather, if not the popular route, and may involve a choice. The runners decision when there is a choice of routes will generally depend on the weather, visibility, surface conditions and their ability to ascend at that point in the race.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

==Organizations==
The [[#External links|organizations]] that organize fell running are as follows. The [[Fell Runners Association]] publishes a calendar of 400 to 500 races per year. Additional races, less publicised, are organised in UK regions. The [[British Open Fell Runners Association]] (BOFRA) publishes a smaller calendar of races - mostly derived from the professional guide races - in England and Scotland and organises a championship series. In Scotland, all known hill races (both professional and amateur) are listed in the annual calendar of [[Scottish Hill Runners]]. In Wales, the [[Welsh Fell Runners Association]] provides a similar service. Northern Ireland events are organised by [[Northern Ireland Mountain Running Association]]. Again, races are run on the premise that a contender possesses mountain navigational skills and carries carry adequate survival equipment. In Ireland events are organised by the Irish Mountain Running Association.
The WMRA - World Mountain Running Association - is the governing body for Mountain Running and as such is sanctioned by and affiliated to the IAAF, the International Association of Athletics Federations.

==Novices==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2008}}
Fell running is a reasonably accessible sport, requiring little in the way of expensive equipment and facilities. As with all running sports a reasonable level of fitness is required to participate. However, unlike other endurance running sports, there is an additional small but very real risk of death on longer races where exhaustion and poor weather in remote areas infrequently leads to death from [[exposure]]. Unlike most distance running where really severe exhaustion means sitting on a pavement waiting for help; help might be hours away and temperatures may plummet in the mountains whilst the fell runner wears only light clothing.

Most fell runners begin by initially trying a short fell run and may then decide to enter a race. Even the most fit and fast road, track or cross country runners can benefit from a couple of weeks of including sharp climbs and descents in their training to prepare untrained muscle groups.

==Race categories==
Courses are categorised by the amount of ascent and distance.

===Ascent categories===
====Category A====
*at least 250 ft (76.2 m) of ascent per mile (1.6&nbsp;km)
*should not have more than 20% of the race distance on road
*should be at least one mile in length

====Category B====
*at least 125 ft (38.1 m)  of ascent per mile (1.6&nbsp;km)
*should not have more than 30% of the race distance on road

====Category C====
*at least 100 ft (30.5 m) of ascent per mile (1.6&nbsp;km)
*should not have more than 40% of the race distance on road
*should contain some genuine fell terrain

===Distance Categories===
====Category L====
*for Long - over 12 miles (19.3&nbsp;km)
====Category M====
*for Medium - over 6 miles (9.6&nbsp;km)
====Category S====
*for Short - less than 6 miles (9.6&nbsp;km)

===Additional categories===
====Category O====
*also known as a '''Long O''' event
*checkpoints are revealed to each competitor when they come up to a <U+201C>staggered<U+201D> start
*entry by choosing an '''orienteering''' type class, such as a [[orienteering#Score-O|Score-O]] event and often as a team of two ('''pairs''')

====Category MM====
*events also known as [[Mountain Marathon]]s and Mountain Trials
*similar to '''Category O''', but multi-day events, in wild, mountainous country. Competitors must carry all the equipment and food required for the overnight camp and subsequent days. Entry is usually as a pair.

===Three example "classic A" races===
*''Wasdale Fell Race'' '''AL''' 21 miles (34&nbsp;km) 9,000 ft (2750 m) - male record 3:25:21 (Billy Bland, 1982), female record 4:12:17 (Janet McIver and Jackie Lee, 2008)
*''Ben Nevis Race'' '''AM''' 10 miles (16&nbsp;km) 4,400 ft (1340 m) - male record 1:25:34 (Kenny Stuart, 1984), female record 1:43:25 (Pauline Haworth 1984)
*''Blisco Dash'' '''AS''' 5 miles (8.1&nbsp;km) 2,000 ft (610 m) - male record 36:01 (Jack Maitland, 1987), female record 47:25 (Louise Sharp, 2004)

==Footwear==
Modern fell running trainers use light, non waterproof material to eject water and dislodge peat after traversing boggy ground. While the trainer needs to be supple, to grip an uneven, slippery surface, a degree of side protection against rock and scree (loose stones) may be provided. Rubber studs have been the mode for two decades, preceded by ripple soles, spikes and the flat soled <U+2018>pumps<U+2019> of the fifties.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

[[Walshes]] are extensively used by many UK runners, especially in the [[Lake District]], where their sole pattern gives excellent grip on steep grass.  Shoe manufacturers such as [[Montrail]] are also leading the chasing pack to try to make better and better shoes to compete with the classic Norman Walsh's design. {{Fact|date=April 2008}} County Durham (UK) based manufacturer [[Inov-8]] have gained a whole swath of awards in recent years and have an extensive array of shoes ranging from studded fell shoes to ones designed for [[parkour]] running.

==24 hour challenges==
Fell runners have set many of the [[peak bagging]] records in the UK. In 1932 the Lakeland runner Bob Graham set a record of 42 Lakeland peaks in 24 hours. His feat, now know as the [[Bob Graham Round]], was not repeated for many years (in 1960); by 2003, however, it had become a fell-runner's test-piece, and had been repeated by over 1060 people. Building on the basic 'Round' later runners such as Eric Beard (56 tops in 1963) and [[Joss Naylor]] (72 tops in 1975) have raised the 24 hour Lakeland record considerably. The present record is 77 peaks, and was set by Mark Hartell in 1997<ref>http://www.mh.k313.com/mh/fell/bg/24HourRecord.html</ref>. The ladies record is 62 peaks, set in 1994 by Anne Stentiford<ref>http://www.mh.k313.com/mh/fell/bg/Womens24HourRecord.html</ref>.

Most fell running regions have their own challenges or "rounds":
*Lake District <U+2013> [[The Bob Graham Round]]
*Scotland <U+2013> The Ramsay Round
*North Wales <U+2013> The [[Paddy Buckley Round]]
*South Wales - [[South Wales Traverse]]
*Ireland <U+2013> [http://www.imra.ie/wicklowround The Wicklow Round]
