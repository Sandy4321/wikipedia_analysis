''Mario & Sonic'' on the Wii and DS is a collection of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. Players can assume the role of a Nintendo or Sega character while competing against the others in these events. Players use the Wii Remote to mimic actions performed in real life sports, such as swinging a [[Paddle tennis|paddle]]. The DS version utilize the stylus and button controls. Both games closely follow rules and regulations of the specific sports.<ref name="1up review"/> Sega adopted the IOC's mission of promoting a sporting spirit and its desire to interest young people in the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] by using its characters. Due to the aforementioned and the atmosphere of competitive sportsmanship the Olympics had to offer, Sega received approval by Nintendo to include Mario in the game with Sonic.<ref name="Q&A"/><ref name="cvg interview1"/> Sonic the Hedgehog is the protagonist of the video game series released by Sega in order to provide the company with a mascot to rival Nintendo's flagship character Mario in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://uk.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/hist_sonic/index.html|title= The History of Sonic the Hedgehog|accessdate= 2008-08-25 |last= Davis|first= Cameron|coauthors= Shoemaker, Brad|date= 2000-11-01|publisher= GameSpot|pages=p. 1}}</ref>

Overall, critics praised the multiplayer interaction of the Wii game and variety of events of both versions. However, reviewers criticized the Wii version for its lack of simplicity and its DS counterpart for not offering the same interaction between players. The Wii title was awarded the "Best Wii game of 2007" at the [[Games Convention]] in [[Leipzig]].<ref name="leipzig">{{cite web|url= http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/best-of-gc-titles-winners-announced|title=Best of GC titles winners announced|accessdate=2008-04-18|last=Elliot|first=Phil|date=2007-08-28|publisher=[[GamesIndustry.biz]]}}</ref> Both versions have sold approximately ten million units combined as of July 2008.<ref name=worldwide/>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Wii Mario & Sonic trampolining event.jpg|left|thumb|The player twists the [[Wii Remote]] and press various buttons as instructed to perform tricks in the [[trampolining]] event.]]

''Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games'' is a collection of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games.<ref name="September PR"/><ref name="1up DSreivew"/> On the Wii, the events consist of using the motion sensor capabilities of the Wii Remote and [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk]] attachment to control the actions of the on-screen character. The player moves the remote in a manner similar to the method the separate games are played in real life;<ref>{{cite news|first=John |last=Gaudiosi| title = Athletes play video games as Olympics go virtual| publisher = [[Reuters]]| location = [[London]]| date = 2008-08-07| url = http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSN8729423320080807?sp=true| accessdate = 2008-04-26}}</ref> for example, swinging the Wii Remote to replicate [[hammer throw]] or pulling back the remote and tilting the Nunchuk like a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] and [[arrow]]. While the Nunchuck is required for [[archery]], it is optional for most of the events. There are also events that are more physically demanding, such as the five running events which require rapid drumming of the controller.<ref name="IGN Wiiview"/> Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. For example, in table tennis the player movement is controlled by the Wii, while the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player.<ref name="GS review"/> The DS game is the same in design, but its events are less physically demanding than those on the Wii. For example, instead of drumming the controller, players have to quickly stroke the touchscreen.<ref name="IGN dsreview"/>
 
''Mario & Sonic'' brings together the two titular characters and fourteen more from both franchises to participate in environments based on the official venues of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]].<ref name="press release"/> These environments are stylized to fit the futuristic and cartoon-like art styles of the ''Sonic'' and ''Mario'' franchises respectively.<ref name="September PR"/><ref name="proG Wiiview">{{cite web|url= http://www.videogamer.com/wii/mario_sonic_at_the_olympic_games/review.html|title= Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Review |accessdate= 2008-08-06 |last= Freeman|first= Will |date= 2007-11-15 |work= [[Pro-G]]|publisher= VideoGamer.com}}</ref> Each playable character has his or her own statistics which can serve as an advantage or disadvantage depending on the event. The characters are divided into four categories: all-around, speed, power, and skill.<ref name="September PR"/> The Wii version has additional in-game characters taken from the console's [[Mii Channel]], which allows the user to create a Mii, a customized avatar, that can be imported into games that support the feature.<ref name="IGN Wiiview"/> Both games have [[non-player characters|non-playable characters]] who serve as [[referee]]s for particular events.
 
[[Image:DS M&S Dream Canoe.jpg|right|thumb|The player strokes the touchscreen to row in Dream Canoe. Players try to collect the most coins and can use items from the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' games.]]
Both versions of ''Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games'' have three similar modes of gameplay: Circuit mode, Single Match, and Mission mode. Circuit mode is where players compete for the highest overall score in a pre-determined series of events or design their own circuit.<ref name="September PR"/> In the Single Match, players can choose to compete in each event individually. Mission mode is a single-player option where each of the competitors has six character-specific missions to complete, although the characters' statistics are not as balanced as in the main game, making missions more difficult.<ref name="IGN Wiiview"/> The Wii version's Circuit and Single Match can have an additional one to three players competing simultaneously while its DS counterpart has a extra option dedicated to multiplayer called Versus Play.<ref name="Wii manual"/><ref name="DS manual"/> Versus supports up to four people to use the wireless capabilities of the Nintendo DS to play events. [[DS Download Play]] is possible for those without a individual copy of the game, however the number of sports available is limited.<ref name="IGN dsreview"/><ref name="proG DSreview"/>

Both versions feature a gallery mode where brief facts about the Olympics can be found. There are five categories of Olympics-related trivia organized by history and athletes, with corresponding [[minigame]]s that will unlock the answer to trivia questions once completed. Classic music from both series is available in the gallery once all levels in a category are cleared.<ref name="Wii manual">{{cite book | editor=Sega | title=Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games (Wii) instruction manual | pages=pp. 8, 13|publisher=Nintendo |date=2007-11-06}}</ref><ref name="DS manual">{{cite book | editor=Sega | title=Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games (DS) instruction manual | pages=pp. 10, 21|publisher=Nintendo |date=2008-01-22}}</ref> The two versions also have leaderboards that uses the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] to display the best times and scores in each event.<ref name="IGN Wiiview"/><ref name="IGN dsreview"/>
 
===Events===
''Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games'' features authentic Olympic events for the single match and circuit modes.<ref name="September PR"/> The types of events are classified as [[Athletics (track and field)|athletics]], [[gymnastics]], [[shooting]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[archery]], [[aquatics]], [[fencing]], and [[table tennis]].<ref name="IGN Wiiview"/> Similar events have varying gameplay aspects; for example, getting a starting boost in the [[100 metres|100&nbsp;m dash]] is more important than in the longer relay races, since the initial short burst of greater speed would play less of a role in winning the longer distance runs. In relay events, such as the [[4 x 100 metres relay|4&nbsp;<U+00D7>&nbsp;100&nbsp;metres relay]] and 4&nbsp;<U+00D7>&nbsp;100&nbsp;metres aquatics relay, players can assemble teams comprising any four characters.

Besides these regular events, there are alternate versions of Olympic events called "Dream Events". Unlike the regular events, the gameplay in Dream Events is exaggerated. Taking place in locations and using objects from older games of the ''Mario'' and ''Sonic'' series, Dream Events allow players to use the special abilities of characters and display dramatic moments in slow motion.<ref name="IGN Wiiview"/><ref name="gold/events"/>
 
Although the Wii and DS versions of the game feature mostly the same events, each version has events that are not found in the other. The relay races are exclusive to the Wii version. In contrast, the DS version has five Dream Events&mdash;canoeing, boxing, basketball, long jump, and skeet shooting&mdash;not featured on the Wii version.<ref name="Eurogamer DSreview"/> The sports available in both versions unless otherwise noted are listed below.

=== Critical response ===
Although the Wii version of ''Mario and Sonic'' was awarded the "Best Wii game of 2007" at the [[Games Convention]] in [[Leipzig]],<ref name="leipzig" /> it received mixed reactions from game critics; the DS version had a similar reception. A common complaint was that Sega and Nintendo failed to set the first matchup between their mascots in the genre that made them famous&mdash;[[platform games]].<ref name="GS review"/><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=82581|title= First Impressions: Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games |accessdate= 2008-04-18|last= Gibson|first= Ellie |date=2007-09-03 |publisher=[[Eurogamer]]}}</ref>  Instead, the two companies threw Mario and Sonic into an Olympic-themed [[Party game#party video game|party video game]],<ref name=EGM223/><ref name="Neur wiiview"/> a move which ''[[GamePro]]'' criticized as "a marketing tool" to popularize the XXIX Olympic Games.<ref name="GamePro Wiiview"/> Although the Wii version of the game was praised for being an entertaining multiplayer experience,<ref name="Wii meta"/> it was criticized for shallow gameplay and complex rules and instructions.<ref name=EGM223/><ref name="x-play review"/> [[GameTrailers]] concluded that ''Mario & Sonic's'' lack of "polish and simplicity" leaves the improbable grouping of mascots as its main attraction when compared to other party video games released for the platform.<ref>{{cite video|date2= 2007-11-20 |title = Mario & Sonic Olympics Review|url = http://www.gametrailers.com/player/28185.html |publisher= [[GameTrailers]]|location = California |accessdate = 2008-01-02|time= 5:03}}</ref>

[[GameSpot]] rated the Wii version's motion control scheme as "uninteresting and occasionally frustrating".<ref name="GS review"/> [[X-Play]] agreed, calling the controls "non-intuitive" and commenting that the minigames required players to "wave their Wiimotes frantically while pressing several buttons at the same time".<ref name="x-play review"/> An ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' editor mentioned that the controls were complicated for a game that should be a "pure pick-up-and-play party game".<ref name=EGM223/> ''GamePro'' said the events were "short and fairly shallow" and mostly required players to move the "Wii Remote and Nunchuks in specific ways&mdash;rapidly up and down for running events, for example".<ref name="GamePro Wiiview"/> IGN called ''Mario & Sonic'' a success due to the entertainment value derived from the slight variety of competitions offered in the game. However, it and several other critics felt that events within the same classification were similar; IGN noted that diversity was lacking as "five or six [events felt] nearly identical", and GameSpot found the gameplay of several events to be overly similar to one another despite the reviewer praising the game for its number of events. Both review sites favored the more complex objectives found in the fantasy events of the game, which shared attributes with that of the [[List of Mario games by genre#Sports series|Mario sport games]] and archery.<ref name="GS review"/><ref name="IGN Wiiview"/>

On the Nintendo DS, ''Mario & Sonic'' was regarded as virtually the same game in design as its Wii counterpart; however, opinions on its control scheme varied greatly. Andrew Fitch of [[1UP.com]] assured readers in his review that the less physically demanding gameplay of the DS version made the game accessible for extended periods of time. Fitch further stated that in nearly "every case, events [were] far more enjoyable on the DS" due to the requirement of the human body's finer [[motor skill]] abilities to control the characters.<ref name="1up DSreivew"/> However, [[Eurogamer]] noted that the lack of physical demand reduced the players' engrossment with the game.<ref name="Eurogamer DSreview"/> IGN had a similar opinion, stating, "Rapidly drumming the controllers is far more challenging than quickly stroking the touchscreen."<ref name="IGN dsreview"/>
   
For both versions, critics preferred the remixed Nintendo and Sega music, and IGN thought the general Olympic-related music "[could] be a bit generic".<ref name="IGN Wiiview"/> [[GameDaily]] called the background music "mostly forgettable",<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gamedaily.com/games/mario-and-sonic-at-the-olympic-games/wii/game-reviews/item/5933/1857/?page=2|title= Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Review (WII)|accessdate= 2008-08-17 |last=Workman |first=Robert |date= 2007-11-12 |work= [[AOL]]|publisher= [[GameDaily]]}}</ref> and ''GamePro'' thought that "most of the music [wasn't] too interesting".<ref name="GamePro DSreview"/> Most publications agreed that the Wii counterpart of ''Mario & Sonic'' had clean textures and well-done animations; [[N-Europe]] thought that each character was pleasingly [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]],<ref name="Neur wiiview">{{cite web|url= http://n-europe.com/review.php?rid=336|title= Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games (Wii)|accessdate= 2008-08-05|last= Hockley|first= Iun|date= 2007-11-24 |work=Advanced Media Network|publisher=[[N-Europe]]}}</ref> and GameSpot added that the graphics were "crisp and colorful".<ref name="GS review"/> Compared to the Wii version, the DS version's visuals are of the same style and its graphics are nearly on the same level.<ref name="IGN dsreview"/><ref name="Eurogamer DSreview"/> Due to the inability to compete against other players online, IGN regarded ''Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games''{{'}} use of the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection on the DS as a "missed opportunity".<ref name="IGN dsreview"/> Many reviewers, including Eurogamer and [[Pro-G]], found the uploading of best times and scores to be a cumbersome process.<ref name="proG DSreview">{{cite web|url= http://www.videogamer.com/ds/mario_sonic_at_the_olympic_games/review.html|title= Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Review |accessdate= 2008-08-06 |last= Orry|first= James |date= 2008-02-25 |work= [[Pro-G]]|publisher= VideoGamer.com}}</ref><ref name="Eurogamer DSreview"/> Although the home console version also has online rankings, it lacks direct competition between players. Disappointed with the aforementioned aspect, IGN rationalized that the leaderboards "certainly [made] sense for a game like this".<ref name="IGN Wiiview"/>
