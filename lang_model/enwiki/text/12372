He was appointed as [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Georgia)|Minister of Internal Affairs of Georgia]] in the [[cabinet of Bidzina Ivanishvili]] on October 25, 2012.

==Early career==
Irakli Gharibashvili graduated from the [[Tbilisi State University]] (TSU) with a degree in International Relations in 2004. He also studied at the [[Pantheon-Sorbonne University]] from 2002 to 2004 and obtained a master's degree in International Relations from the TSU in 2005. Since 2004, he has worked with the multi-billionaire [[Bidzina Ivanishvili]], becoming Director General of Ivanishvili's charity foundation Cartu in 2005, a member of the supervisory board of Ivanishvili's Cartu Bank in 2007 and director of the label Georgian Dream founded by Ivanishvili's pop-star son [[Bera Ivanishvili|Bera]] in 2009.<ref>[http://www.government.gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&sec_id=124&info_id=200 Irakli Garibashvili]. Government of Georgia. Accessed December 8, 2012.</ref>

Gharibashvili became involved in the politics of Georgia when Ivanishvili founded his political party [[Georgian Dream<U+2013>Democratic Georgia]] in February 2012. He was included in the party list of [[Member of Parliament|MP]] candidates for the October 1 [[Georgian parliamentary election, 2012|parliamentary election]].

==Minister of Internal Affairs==
After the Georgian Dream's victory in the 2012 parliamentary election, Gharibashvili was appointed as Minister of Internal Affairs in the cabinet of now-[[Prime Minister of Georgia|Prime Minister]] Ivanishvili on October 25, 2012. Gharibashvili, then 30 years old and described by the [[Georgian media]] as "Ivanishvili's right-hand man", became the youngest member of Georgia's new government. Reforming the Interior Ministry, a powerful agency overseeing [[Georgian police|police]], security and intelligence services, as well as the border guard and [[Coast Guard of Georgia|navy]], was a part of the Georgian Dream's pre-election agenda.<ref>[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=25403 New Interior Minister Names his Deputies]. [[Civil Georgia]]. October 30, 2012. Accessed December 8, 2012.</ref>  

In November 2012, the Interior Ministry arrested several high-ranking officials from the previous government, including the former minister [[Bachana Akhalaia]]. This led to concerns regarding selective justice and political vengeance and drew criticism from the domestic opposition and the international media.<ref>[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=25495 Ivanishvili: Saakashvili's Lobbying 'Will Not Stop Restoring Justice']. Civil Georgia. November 30, 2012. Accessed December 8, 2012.</ref> Gharibashvili's agency also faced the post-election spike in crime in Georgia. Gharibashvili defended the arrests as being in strict accordance with the law and justice and claimed that the rate of minor crime, albeit increased, was not alarming.<ref>[http://georgiaonline.ge/news/a1/politics/1353376810.php Interior Minister: Recent arrests are fair].
