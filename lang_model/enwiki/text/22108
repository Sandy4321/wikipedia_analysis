The '''Oslo Metro rolling stock''' consists of three classes: [[T1000|T1000/T1300]], [[T2000]] and [[MX3000]]. The T1000 was built as 162 single cars from 1964 to 1978. From 1979 to 1985, 33 new T1300 trains were built, followed by the conversion of 16 T1000s. Six two-car T2000 units were delivered in 1994. Since 2005, 83 three-car MX3000 units have been replacing the older stock, and the last T1000 was retired in 2007. From 2010, only MX3000-trains will be in use. The T1000/T1300 and T2000 were built by [[Str<U+00F8>mmens V<U+00E6>rksted]], with motors from [[Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri]] (NEBB) and [[AEG]], respectively, and the MX3000 were built by [[Siemens AG|Siemens]].

All trains receive 750&nbsp;V DC from a [[third rail]] shoe, while the T1300 and T2000 also have [[pantograph (rail)|pantographs]]. This allows the latter to also operate on the suburban lines of the [[Oslo Tramway]], which the western part of the current metro was part of until 1995. All trains feature [[automatic train protection]] and [[accessibility|step-free access]] from the platforms. Trains can operate up to six cars in length. The T1000/T1300 and MX3000 are capable of {{convert|70|km/h}}, while the T2000 can operate at {{convert|100|km/h}}. The T2000 introduced [[articulated car]]s, while the MX3000 introduced [[regenerative brake]]s and [[air conditioning]]. The T1000/T1300 and MX3000 can be run [[multiple-unit train control|in multiple]] with each other, but not with the T2000. The MX3000 replaced the red color scheme with a white livery.

==History==
{{main|History of the Oslo Tramway and Metro}}

In 1954, the Oslo City Council decided to build a four-line metro to the new suburbs to the east of the city center. The plans called for the system to open in 1966, with the conversion of the [[<U+00D8>stensj<U+00F8> Line]] and the [[Lambertseter Line]] of the [[Oslo Tramway]], and the new [[Furuset Line]] and [[Grorud Line]]. The system would feature higher and longer platforms, allowing step-free access to six-car trains, automatic train protection and third-rail power supply. This would make the metro incompatible with the existing tramways in Oslo.<ref name=a29>Aspenberg, 1994: 29</ref> The first units in the T1000 series were two single-car prototypes designated T. They were test-run on the existing tramways from 1959 to 1960, and were then put into service on the [[Kols<U+00E5>s Line]]. Prone to technical faults, they were taken out of regular service in 1982.<ref>{{cite journal |title=N.Teatret <U+2013> Kols<U+00E5>s |journal=[[Lokaltrafikk]] |year=1998 |volume=37 |pages=4<U+2013>18 |author=Andersen, Bj<U+00F8>rn and Bj<U+00F8>rn O.

[[File:T1300, T5 1313, Valler HKG.JPG|thumb|left|T1300 unit near [[Valler (station)|Valler]]]]
Serial production of the T1000 started in 1964 by Str<U+00F8>mmens V<U+00E6>rksted, NEBB and AEG. Until 1978, 162 cars were delivered to Oslo Sporveier. These were manufactured in four series, designated T1 through T4, with minor changes to specifications. During the late 1970s, the western suburban lines which were part of the tramway needed new rolling stock. Oslo Sporveier was at the time considering connecting the metro with these lines, and between 1978 and 1981, 33 new T1300 cars were built. The only difference from the T1000 was that they had a pantograph that allowed them to operate on the tramways. They also retained the necessary technical appliances to run on the metro. The new T1300 were designated T5 and T6. From 1985 to 1989, 16 T4s were rebuilt to T1300 and designated T7 and T8.<ref name=a63 />

Oslo Sporveier was highly satisfied with the [[SL79]] [[articulated tram]]s that had been delivered during the 1980s. In 1985, work started on the development of a modified version for the western suburban lines. The stock on the [[Holmenkoll Line|Holmenkollen]] and [[Kols<U+00E5>s Line]]s were the first that needed to be replaced. At the same time, the company wanted to make the trains compatible with the metro so they could operate on both systems. The new stock was considered to be a trial; if it met performance expectations, future orders could be made to replace the T1000 stock, after the latter reached the end of its economical life in about 2000. The required specification for the new train was published in October 1988.<ref name=johansson>{{cite journal |author=Johansson, Erik W. |title=T2000 - AS Oslo Sporveiers nyte T-banevogner |year=1995 |volume=81 |journal=[[P<U+00E5> Sporet]] |pages=44<U+2013>46}}</ref>

In the late 1980s, it was decided to upgrade the [[R<U+00F8>a Line|R<U+00F8>a]] and [[Sognsvann Line]]s to metro standard. This would allow them to use T1000 stock. Twelve T2000 were ordered in 1991, and would be sufficient to operate the services on the Holmenkollen and Kols<U+00E5>s Lines, that would retain an [[overhead wire]]. The development costs for the T2000 were in part subsidized by the government, as the high-tech product from Str<U+00F8>mmens Verksted (by then part of the [[ABB Group]]) and AEG was seen as a future export product. The trains were delivered in 1994 and taken into use in 1995.<ref name=johansson /> The same year, the metro started operating all services through the city center, connecting the western and eastern networks.<ref>Aspenberg, 1995: 46</ref>

In 1996, the work to establish a financing package for new investments in public transport in [[Akershus]] and Oslo started. [[Oslo Package 2]] was passed in 2001 and allowed municipal and state grants to be supplemented by increased fare and [[Fjellinjen|toll road]] revenue to finance, among other things, new trains for the metro. The initial order by [[Oslo Sporveier]] in 2003 from [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] was for 33 units (99 cars), plus options for further orders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/oslo/article572928.ece |last= |first= |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=28 June 2003 |title=Oslo Sporveier kj<U+00F8>per 99 nye T-banevogner |accessdate=28 March 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/oslo/article573973.ece |last=Tajik |first=Hadia |authorlink=Hadia Tajik |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=30 June 2003 |title=Oslo f<U+00E5>r 99 nye T-banevogner |accessdate=28 March 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref name=slik>{{cite web |url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=225953  |last=Jacobsen |first=Lars |work=[[Verdens Gang]] |date=3 May 2005 |title=Slik blir T-banens nye metro-vogner |accessdate=28 March 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In 2005, the city council voted to replace all existing T1000 and T1300 stock with the MX3000, increasing the quantity by another 30 units.<ref name=nye /> Two test units were delivered in October 2005, with the first serial deliveries in April 2007. With the delivery of the new white and gray trains, Oslo Sporveier received criticism that they had been disloyal to the old red color of the metro, and that they did not follow up on their former design concept from the 1960s through the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tu.no/nyheter/samferdsel/article40776.ece |last=Kronstad |first=Ragna |work=[[Teknisk Ukeblad]] |date=22 June 2005 |title=Ny fargepalett for T-bane |accessdate=28 March 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Following the 2006 decision to convert the Kols<U+00E5>s Line to metro standard, Akershus County Municipality announced they would order five units.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/sec_nyheter/article78914.ece |last= |first= |work=[[Budstikka]] |date=28 March 2006 |title=Klart for metro og trikk |accessdate=28 March 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Unlike the Oslo-owned units, Akershus' five units will be owned by the transit authority [[Ruter]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.budstikka.no/sec_nyheter/article78914.ece |last=Svenningsen |first=Jens |work=[[Budstikka]] |date=5 April 2008 |title=Kj<U+00F8>per nye vogner |accessdate=28 March 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

In November 2006, the city government proposed that the maintenance of the new trains be [[privatization|privatized]]. This resulted in protests from the employees, who campaigned by refusing to work overtime. As a result, after a few weeks, the company lacked 57 trains to provide adequate service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/oslo/article1530466.ece |last=Olsen |first=Thomas |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=13 November 2006 |title=Kaos p<U+00E5> T-banen - mangler 57 vogner    |accessdate=28 March 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The issue was solved when the socialist opposition parties along with the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] agreed to postpone the matter until after all the new trains were delivered in 2009. As part of the agreement, a new limited company, Oslo Vognselskap, wholly owned by Kollektivtransportproduksjon, would take ownership of all metro trains and trams used by the operating companies. Responsibility for the debt accumulated for buying the trains is to be managed by Oslo Vognselskap, while operation and management of the maintenance contracts was transferred to Oslo T-banedrift.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/oslo/article1530466.ece |last=Ensby |first=Anne Linn |work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=22 November 2006 |title=T-baneprivatisering utsatt |accessdate=28 March 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> 

In 2008, the city council in Oslo decided to upgrade the Holmenkollen Line to metro standard, to allow six-car MX3000 trains to be the main mode of transport to [[Holmenkollen ski jump|Holmenkollen Ski Jump]] during the [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011]].

The Oslo Metro uses 750&nbsp;volt direct current fed to the train via a third rail,<ref name=bremseenergi /> along a [[standard gauge]] track. The system is not compatible to the Oslo Tramway, but the T1300 and T2000 have been built to run on both the suburban lines of the tramway and the metro. The platforms are {{convert|110|m}} long, and the height of the train floors are {{convert|1.12|m|sp=us}} above the track, allowing step-free access to the platforms.<ref name=nye>{{cite web |url=http://ruter.no/Reiseinformasjon/Din-sikkerhet/Sikkerhet-pa-T-banen/Nye-T-banevogner-/ |author=[[Ruter]] |date=10 March 2008 |title=MX3000 - nye T-banevogner |accessdate=28 March 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> 

The trains' speed are controlled by an automatic train protection (ATP) system. The speed codes are transferred from the ATP points in the infrastructure, using 75&nbsp;hertz pulses in the tracks. The trains pick up the signals via antennas. The speed codes are {{convert|15|km/h|abbr=on|0}}, {{convert|30|km/h|abbr=on}}, {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}} and {{convert|70|km/h|abbr=on}}. They are communicated to the engineer via signals in the driver's cab; in addition, the system will automatically reduce the speed, should the limit be exceeded. The driver can put the trains in an automatic mode, where the train itself adjusts its speed to the limit. The driver is always responsible for starting and halting the train at stations.<ref name=bremseenergi>{{cite news |url=http://www.tu.no/nyheter/samferdsel/article39779.ece |last=Kronstad |first=Ragna |work=[[Teknisk Ukeblad]] |date=18 October 2005 |title=Bremseenergi fra T-banen |accessdate=28 March 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref name=siemens>{{cite web | title=  References Mass Transit Vehicles: Metro System, Three-Car Train Modules, Oslo, Norway | url= http://references.transportation.siemens.com/refdb/showReference.do?r=2097&div=5&l=en| work= | publisher=Siemens AG |format= | date= 2009 |accessdate=11 May 2009}}</ref>
