'''Samuel Lyde''' (1825&ndash;1860) was an [[English people|English]] writer and [[Church of England]] missionary who worked in [[Syria]] in the 1850s and wrote a pioneering book on the [[Alawite]] sect. In 1856, he sparked months of anti-Christian rioting in [[Ottoman Palestine]] when, during a visit there, he killed a beggar.

Lyde was persuaded by the idea. From 1853 to 1859, he lived among the Alawite community of the [[Kalbiyya]] district, and established a mission and school in Bhamra,<ref name= Moosa>{{cite book |title=Extremist Shi'ites: The Ghulat Sects |last=Moosa |first=Matti |coauthors= |year=1987 |isbn=978-0815624110 |page=277}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference|first =Dick|last =Douwes|title = Knowledge and Oppression: The Nusayriyya in the Late Ottoman Period|booktitle = Convegno sul tema La Shia nell<U+2019>impero ottomano|pages =149-169, (p.158)|publisher = Accademia nazionale dei Lincei, Fondazione Leone Caetani |date =1993|isbn=978-8821804373|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZF7YAAAAMAAJ&q=bhamra+samuel+lyde&dq=bhamra+samuel+lyde&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1i3vUMe-LajQ0QX7yYCIBw&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ|accessdate=9 January 2013}}</ref> a village overlooking the [[Mediterranean]] port of [[Latakia]].<ref name=gua05>{{cite news|last=Joffe|first=Lawrence|title=Major-General Ghazi Kanaan|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/oct/18/syria.lebanon|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 October 2005}}</ref> However, he later wrote that living among them convinced him that the Alawites fulfilled [[St Paul]]'s description of the heathen: "filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness".<ref name= Telegraph/>

==Publications and influence==

Lyde wrote two books on the Alawites: ''The Anseyreeh and Ismaeleeh: A Visit to the Secret Sects of Northern Syria with a View to the Establishment of Schools'' (1853) and ''The Asian Mystery Illustrated in the History, Religion and Present State of the Ansaireeh or Nusairis of Syria'' (1860).<ref>{{cite book |title=Paschal Beverly Randolph: A Nineteenth-century Black American Spiritualist, Rosicrucian and Sex Magician |last=Denney  |first=John Patrick |coauthors= |year=1996 |isbn=978-0791431191 |page=486}}</ref> The latter is considered to be a pioneering work, and was the first [[monograph]] to be written on the Alawite-Nusayri religion.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bar-Asher, M. M. |year=2003 |title=The Iranian Component of the Nusayri Religion |journal=Iran: journal of the British Institute of Persian Studies |volume=41 |issue= |page=223}}</ref><ref name= Seale>{{cite book |title=Asad: The Struggle for the Middle East |last=Seale |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick Seale |year=1992 |isbn=978-0520069763 |page=10}}</ref> It remained the only Western book on the subject until 1900, when [[Ren<U+00E9> Dussaud]] published his ''Histoire et religion des Nosair<U+00EE>s''.<ref name= Seale/>

His description of Alawite doctrines was based on a document called ''Kitab al-mashyakha'' ("The Manual of the Shaykhs"),<ref name= friedman>{{cite book |title=The Nusayri-Alawis: An Introduction to the Religion, History and Identity of the Leading Minority in Syria |last=Friedman  |first=Yaron  |authorlink= |year=2009 |isbn=978-9004178922 |pages=68, 220, 271}}</ref> which he said he had bought from a Christian merchant from Latakia.<ref name= Seale/> This document appears to have differed in certain respects from other sources on Alawite doctrine.<ref name= friedman/> For many years it was thought to have been lost and only available through the extracts quoted in translation by Lyde.<ref name= friedman/> In 2013, it was announced that the document Lyde had used had been discovered in the archives of the Old Library of Jesus College, Cambridge.<ref name=Kriegler1and5>{{cite journal |author=Bella Tendler Kriegler |year=2013|title=The Rediscovery of Samuel Lyde's Lost Nusayr<U+012B> Kit<U+0101>b al-Mashyakha (Manual for Shaykhs) |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society]] | pages=1-16 (pages 1 and 5) |doi =10.1017/S135618631300059X |accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> Lyde had bequeathed it to his old college, and, apparently, had sent it to Cambridge shortly before his death.<ref name=Kriegler1and5/>  

His writing reveals a negative view of the Alawites and, in particular, he was critical of what he saw as their brigandage, feuds, lying and divorce.<ref name= Telegraph/>  He went as far as saying that "the state of [Alawi] society was a perfect hell upon earth".<ref>{{cite book |title=Greater Syria: The History of an Ambition |last=Pipes  |first=Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Pipes |year=1992 |isbn=978-0195060225 |page=165}}</ref> ''The Asian Mystery'' became a popular book and has been described as "colourful" but "unreliable" in some respects.<ref name= Telegraph/> Nevertheless, Lyde's account remains an influential source on Alawites, and, for instance, is widely quoted on the internet.<ref name= Telegraph/>
