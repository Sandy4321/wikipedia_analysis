'''Sacro Cuore di Cristo Re''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] church ([[Basilica minor|minor basilica]]) in Rome, designed between the 1920s and 1930s by [[Marcello Piacentini]].

== History ==
The idea for a new church in the new district of Della Vittoria (literally ''Of Victory'', named for the victory in [[World War I]]) came from Ottavio Gasparri, member of the Sacred Heart of Jesus  [[religious institute]]. At first the church was to be named '''Tempio della Pace''',<ref>{{it icon}} ''Roma - Guide Rosse d'Italia'', Touring Editore, 1999, page 723</ref> to remember and honour the fallen of [[World War I]]. Construction began in May 1920.<ref>1924, according to {{it icon}} ''Roma - Guide Rosse d'Italia'', Touring Editore, 1999, page 723</ref> The original design proposed by [[Marcello Piacentini]] was inspired by the churches built in Rome in the 16th century.

Construction halted with the death of Ottavio Gasparri, in 1929. In the next two years Piacentini worked for radical changes, following the emerging [[Rationalism (architecture)|Rationalism]] that became [[fascist architecture|Italian rationalism]], and the Sacro Cuore di Ges<U+00F9> became the braeking point of the [[sacred architecture]] in the Rome context.
The construction started again in 1931 and the church was inaugurated in 1934.

The church was made a parish church by [[Pope Pius XI]] on 31 October 1926 with the [[apostolic constitution]] ''Regis pacifici''. On 5 February 1965 was appointed [[Titulus (Roman Catholic)|titular church]] by [[Pope Paul VI]] with the apostolic constitution ''Sacrum Cardinalium Collegium''. Later that year, with the [[motu proprio]] ''Recentioris architecturae'' it was given the title of [[minor basilica]].

== Design ==


The church has a bricks facing, the facade with brick rows of different projection alternated; facade upper side, portals and windows are boarded with [[travertine]]. The floor plan, with a [[nave]] flanked byt two [[aisle]]s, is between a  [[christian cross|Latin cross]] and [[greek cross]], with a length of about 70 m. The church present a [[dome]] of 20 meters of diameter.
Over the main portal an [[high relief]] by [[Arturo Martini]], that depicts the [[Sacred Heart|sacred heart of Jesus]]. In the inside the [[Stations of the Cross]] made by Alfredo Biagini.
