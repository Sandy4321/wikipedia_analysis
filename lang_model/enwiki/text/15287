"'''Running'''" is a [[synthpop]] song written by [[Tony Kanal]] and [[Gwen Stefani]] for [[No Doubt]]'s fourth [[studio album]] ''[[Rock Steady (album)|Rock Steady]]'' ([[2001 in music|2001]]) and was released worldwide as the album's fourth and final [[single (music)|single]] on [[July 1]], [[2003 in music|2003]]. The song was also used on the last episode of Sabrina the Teenage Witch in 2003.

The song received mixed reviews from music critics and was compared to [[Depeche Mode]]-style songs. The song only charted on the official charts of [[Billboard Hot 100|United States]], where it became the band's lowest charting single, [[German Singles Chart|Germany]], where it had  longest charting period. It was the least successful single of the album, peaked at number thirty-eight on the United World Chart. The song was accompanied by a [[music video]] which was directed by Chris Hafner, which featured many old and new pictures as well as clippings of the band members.

==Background==
The song was written by Stefani and [[bassist]] Tony Kanal in Kanal's living room.<ref name="singles">Montoya, Paris and  Lanham, Tom.  "Running".  ''[[The Singles 1992-2003]]'' (liner notes).

Retrieved [[October 22]], [[2007]].</ref> and developed the song's [[harmony]] first and then wrote the lyrics. The band worked on the track to give it a "spacier sound" but were displeased with the result so took the song to producer [[Nellee Hooper]], who stripped ''Running'' down to the basics.<ref name="singles"/>The song was then produced by her, with whom Stefani collaborated again for her solo project a year later.  Whatever the intent, the end result was a track that resonated with a catchy Nintendo "Mario Brothers" background throughout the entire song.<ref>Vineyard, Jennifer[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1480948/20031205/no_doubt.jhtml "Gwen Stefani Turns To Bandmate For Aid After Freak-Out"] ''[[MTV]]'' Retrieved on [[April 19]], [[2008]]</ref>

==Reception==
===Critical===

''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' characterized the song as "twenty-first-century [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]" and compared its [[synthesizer]]s and restrained vocal to the work of [[Depeche Mode]].<ref>Howe, Rupert.
