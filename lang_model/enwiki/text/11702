The '''Battle of Midway''' ({{lang-ja|<U+30DF><U+30C3><U+30C9><U+30A6><U+30A7><U+30FC><U+6D77><U+6226>}}) is widely regarded as the most important naval battle of the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific Campaign]] of [[World War II]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq81-1.htm |title=Battle of Midway: June&nbsp;4-7,1942 |publisher=Naval History & Heritage Command |date=27 April 2005 |accessdate=20 February 2009}} "...considered the decisive battle of the war in the Pacific."</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last=Dull | first=Paul S | title=Battle History of the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1941-1945 | date= | publisher=US Naval Institute Press |isbn=1-59114-219-9 | pages=}} "Midway ''was'' indeed "the" decisive battle of the war in the Pacific.", [http://books.google.ca/books?id=SLfti-Dc1AcC&pg=PA145&lpg=PA145&dq=Midway+decisive+battle&source=bl&ots=wRGD-EQNKv&sig=Qx7UryTe62zBfpbra_SQBu6w2mk&hl=en&ei=B6-gSbTqE5HItQO3-ajdCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result#PPA166,M1 p. 166]</ref><ref name="Midway Decisive">{{Cite web| last = | first = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/carriers/midway.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070612040835/http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/carriers/midway.html | archivedate = 2007-06-12 | title = A Brief History of Aircraft Carriers: Battle of Midway | work = | publisher = U.S. Navy | accessdate = 12 June 2007}}</ref> Between 4 and 7 June 1942, approximately one month after the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] and six months after [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the [[United States Navy]] decisively defeated an [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) attack against [[Midway Atoll]], inflicting irreparable damage on the Japanese fleet.<ref name="U.S">U.S. Naval War College Analysis, p.1; Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp.416<U+2013>430.</ref> Military historian [[John Keegan]] has called it "the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare."<ref>Keegan, John. "The Second World War." New York: Penguin, 2005. (275)</ref>

The Japanese operation, like the earlier attack on Pearl Harbor, aimed to eliminate the United States as a strategic power in the Pacific, thereby giving Japan a free hand in establishing its [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. The Japanese hoped that another demoralizing defeat would force the U.S. to capitulate in the [[Pacific War]].<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 33; Peattie & Evans, ''Kaigun''.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>

The Japanese plan was to lure the United States' few remaining [[aircraft carrier]]s into a trap.<ref>H.P. Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin''; Lundstrom, ''First South Pacific Campaign''; Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 19<U+2013>38.</ref> The Japanese also intended to occupy Midway Atoll as part of an overall plan to extend their defensive perimeter in response to the [[Doolittle Raid]]. This operation was considered preparatory for further attacks against [[Fiji]] and [[Samoa]].

The plan was handicapped by faulty Japanese assumptions of American reaction and poor initial dispositions.<ref>Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin''{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> Most significantly, American [[Station HYPO|codebreakers]] were able to determine the date and location of the attack, enabling the forewarned U.S. Navy to set up an ambush of its own. Four Japanese aircraft carriers and a [[heavy cruiser]] were sunk in exchange for one American aircraft carrier and a [[destroyer]]. After Midway, and the exhausting attrition of the [[Solomon Islands campaign]], Japan's shipbuilding and pilot training programs were unable to keep pace in replacing their losses while the U.S. steadily increased output in both areas.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 416-419.</ref>

==Strategic context==
Japan had been highly successful in swiftly securing its initial war goals, including the conquest of the [[Philippines]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore]], and the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]) with its vital resources. As such, preliminary planning for a second phase of operations commenced as early as January 1942. However, because of strategic differences between the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Army]] and Imperial Navy, as well as infighting between the Navy's [[Imperial General Headquarters|GHQ]] and [[Admiral]] [[Yamamoto Isoroku|Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s [[Combined Fleet]], the formulation of effective strategy was hampered, and the follow-up strategy was not finalized until April 1942.<ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'', pp.13<U+2013>15, 21<U+2013>23; Willmott, ''The Barrier and the Javelin,'' pp. 39<U+2013>49; Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 22<U+2013>38.</ref> Admiral Yamamoto succeeded in winning a bureaucratic struggle, placing his operational concept<U+2014>further operations in the Central Pacific<U+2014>ahead of other contending plans. These included operations either directly or indirectly aimed at Australia and into the Indian Ocean. In the end, Yamamoto's thinly veiled threat to resign unless he got his way carried his agenda forward.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 33; Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'', p. 23.</ref>

Yamamoto's primary strategic concern was the elimination of America's remaining carrier forces, which he perceived as the principal obstacle to the overall Pacific campaign.{{#tag:ref|In fact, U.S. submarines were more dangerous to Japan's efforts. Blair, ''Silent Victory'' ''passim''; Parillo, ''Japanese Merchant Marine''.|group=nb}} This concern was acutely heightened by the [[Doolittle Raid]] (18 April 1942) in which [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-25 Mitchell|B-25]]s launched from {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}} bombed targets in Tokyo and several other Japanese cities. The raid, while militarily insignificant, was a severe [[psychological operations|psychological]] shock to the Japanese and showed the existence of a gap in the defenses around the Japanese home islands.<ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'', pp. 22<U+2013>26.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Apparently, in light of how poor IJN [[Anti-submarine warfare|ASW]] training and doctrine was the Japanese ignored the presence of American submarines off their coast, beginning with Joe Grenfell's {{USS|Gudgeon|SS-211|2}} some three weeks after Pearl Harbor. Blair, ''Silent Victory'', p.110; Parillo, ''Japanese Merchant Marine''; Peattie & Evans, ''Kaigun''.|group=nb}} Sinking America's aircraft carriers and seizing Midway, the only strategic islands besides Hawaii in the eastern Pacific, was seen as the only means of nullifying this threat. Yamamoto reasoned an operation against the main carrier base at [[Pearl Harbor]] would induce the U.S. to fight. However, given the strength of American land-based air power on Hawaii, he judged the powerful American base could not be attacked directly.<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 33.</ref> Instead, he selected Midway, at the extreme northwest end of the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian Island]] chain, some {{convert|1300|mi|km}} from [[Oahu]]. Midway was not especially important in the larger scheme of Japan's intentions, but the Japanese felt the Americans would consider Midway a vital outpost of Pearl Harbor and would therefore strongly defend it.<ref>Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin,'' pp. 66<U+2013>67; Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 33<U+2013>34.</ref> The U.S. did consider Midway vital; after the battle, establishment of a U.S. [[submarine]] base on Midway allowed submarines operating from Pearl Harbor to refuel and reprovision, extending their radius of operations by {{convert|1200|mi|km|abbr=on}}. An airstrip on Midway served as a forward staging point for bomber attacks on [[Wake Island]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/midway/postwar.html |title=After the Battle of Midway |publisher=Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge}}</ref>

===Yamamoto's plan===
[[File:Midway Atoll.jpg|thumb|Midway Atoll, several months before the battle. Eastern Island (with the airfield) is in the foreground, and the larger Sand Island is in the background to the west.]]

Typical of Japanese naval planning during World War II, Yamamoto's battle plan was exceedingly complex.<ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway,'' pp. 375<U+2013>379, Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin'', pp. 110<U+2013>117; Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 52.</ref> Additionally, his design was predicated on optimistic intelligence suggesting {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}  and {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}}, forming Task Force 16, were the only carriers available to the U.S. Pacific Fleet at the time. At the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] just a month earlier, {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|6}} had been sunk and {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|6}} damaged severely enough that the Japanese believed it also to  have been sunk. The Japanese were also aware that {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}} was undergoing repairs on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] after suffering [[torpedo]] damage from a submarine.

However, more important was Yamamoto's belief the Americans had been demoralized by their frequent defeats during the preceding six months. Yamamoto felt deception would be required to lure the U.S. fleet into a fatally compromised situation.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 53, derived from Japanese War History Series (''Senshi S<U+014D>sh<U+014D>''), Volume 43 ('Midowei Kaisen'), p. 118.</ref> To this end, he dispersed his forces so that their full extent (particularly his [[battleship]]s) would be unlikely to be discovered by the Americans prior to battle. Critically, Yamamoto's supporting battleships and cruisers would trail Vice-Admiral [[Ch<U+016B>ichi Nagumo|Nagumo Ch<U+016B>ichi]]'s carrier striking force by several hundred miles. Japan's heavy surface forces were intended to destroy whatever part of the U.S. fleet might come to Midway's relief, once Nagumo's carriers had weakened them sufficiently for a daylight gun duel;<ref name="Tully, pp. 51, 55">Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 51, 55.</ref> this was typical of the battle doctrine of most major navies.<ref name="parshall_43-45">Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 43<U+2013>45, derived from ''[[Senshi S<U+014D>sh<U+014D>]]'', p. 196.</ref>

Unbeknownst to Yamamoto, the United States had broken the main Japanese naval code (dubbed [[JN-25]] by the Americans). Yamamoto's emphasis on dispersal also meant that none of his formations could support each other. For instance, the only significant warships larger than destroyers that screened Nagumo's fleet were two battleships and three cruisers, despite his carriers being expected to carry out the strikes and bear the brunt of American counterattacks. By contrast, the flotillas of Yamamoto and Kondo had between them two light carriers, five battleships, and six cruisers, none of which would see any action at Midway.<ref name="Tully, pp. 51, 55" /> Their distance from Nagumo's carriers would also have grave implications during the battle, since the larger warships in Yamamoto and Kondo's forces carried [[scout plane]]s, an invaluable reconnaissance capability denied to Nagumo.<ref>Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin''.</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">Lord, ''Incredible Victory''; Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin''; Layton, ''And I Was There: Pearl Harbor and Midway<U+2014>Breaking the Secrets''.</ref>

===Aleutian invasion===
{{Main|Aleutian Islands Campaign}}

Likewise, the Japanese operations in the [[Aleutian Islands]] (Operation AL) removed yet more ships that could otherwise have augmented the force striking Midway. Whereas prior historical accounts have often characterized the Aleutians operation as a feint to draw American forces away, recent scholarship on the battle has suggested that AL was supposed to be launched simultaneously with the attack on Midway.<ref name="parshall_43-45" /> However, a one-day delay in the sailing of Nagumo's task force meant that Operation AL began a day before the Midway attack.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 43<U+2013>45, derived from ''Senshi S<U+014D>sh<U+014D>'', pp. 119<U+2013>121.</ref>

==Prelude to battle==
===American reinforcements===
[[File:G13065 USS Yorktown Pearl Harbor May 1942.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|6}} at [[Pearl Harbor]] days before the battle.]]

To do battle with an enemy force anticipated to muster four or five carriers, Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]], Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas, needed every available U.S. flight deck. He already had [[Vice Admiral]] [[William Halsey]]'s two-carrier (''Enterprise'' and ''Hornet'') [[task force]] at hand, though Halsey was stricken with [[psoriasis]] and had to be replaced by [[Rear Admiral]] [[Raymond A. Spruance]], Halsey's escort commander.<ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'', pp. 80<U+2013>81; Cressman ''et al.'', ''A Glorious Page in Our History,'' p. 37.</ref> Nimitz also hurriedly recalled Rear Admiral [[Frank Jack Fletcher]]'s task force, including the carrier [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|''Yorktown'']] (which had suffered considerable damage at the Battle of the Coral Sea), from the [[South West Pacific Area]]. It reached Pearl Harbor just in time to provision and sail.

Despite estimates that ''Yorktown'' would require several months of repairs at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]], her elevators were intact, and her flight deck largely so.<ref>Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin'', p.337.</ref> The [[Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard]] worked around the clock and in 72 hours, she was restored to a battle-ready state,<ref>Cressman ''et al.'', ''A Glorious Page in Our History'', pp.37<U+2013>45; Lord, ''Incredible Victory'', pp.37<U+2013>39.</ref> judged good enough for two or three weeks of operations, as Nimitz required.<ref>Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin'', p.338.</ref> Her flight deck was patched, whole sections of internal frames cut out and replaced, and several new squadrons were drawn from ''Saratoga''; they did not, however, get time to train.<ref>Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin''; p.337-40?</ref> Nimitz disregarded established procedure in getting his third and last available carrier ready for battle. Just three days after putting into dry dock at Pearl Harbor, ''Yorktown'' was again under way. Repairs continued even as she sortied, with work crews from the repair ship {{USS|Vestal|AR-4|6}}, herself damaged in the attack on Pearl Harbor six months earlier, still aboard.<ref>Lord, ''Incredible Victory'', p.39; Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin'', p.340.</ref>

On Midway Island, the USAAF stationed four squadrons of [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es, along with several [[B-26 Marauder]]s. The Marine Corps had 19 [[SBD Dauntless]]es, seven [[F4F Wildcat|F4F-3 Wildcats]], 17 Vought [[SB2U Vindicator|SBU-3 Vindicators]], 21 Brewster [[Brewster Buffalo|F2A-3]]s, and six Grumman [[TBF Avenger|TBF-1 Avenger]]s, the latter a detachment of VT-8 from ''Hornet''.

===Japanese shortcomings===

Meanwhile, as a result of her participation in the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Japanese carrier {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}} was in port in [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]], awaiting a replacement air group. That there were none immediately available was a failure of the IJN crew training program, which already showed signs of being unable to replace losses.<ref name=Willmott101>Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin'', p.101.</ref> Instructors from the [[Yokosuka Air Corps]] were employed in an effort to make up the shortfall.<ref name=Willmott101/> The heavily damaged {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh<U+014D>kaku||2}} had suffered three bomb hits at Coral Sea, and required months of repair in [[drydock]]. Despite the likely availability of sufficient aircraft between the two ships to re-equip ''Zuikaku'' with a composite air group, the Japanese made no serious attempt to get her into the forthcoming battle.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 65<U+2013>67.</ref> Consequently, Admiral Nagumo would only have four fleet carriers: {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Kaga||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}} forming [[Carrier Division 1]]; {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiry<U+016B>||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>||2}} as [[Carrier Division 2]]. At least part of this was a product of fatigue; Japanese carriers had been constantly on operations since 7 December 1941, including raids on [[Bombing of Darwin (February 1942)|Darwin]] and [[Indian Ocean raid|Colombo]].

The main Japanese strike aircraft to be used were the [[Aichi D3A]]1 [[dive bomber]] and the [[Nakajima B5N]]2, which was capable of being used either as a [[torpedo bomber]] or as a level attack bomber. The main carrier fighter was the fast and highly maneuverable [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Mitsubishi A6M2 Zero]].{{#tag:ref|The code names "Val", "Kate" and "Zeke", which are often applied to these aircraft, were not introduced until late 1943 by the Allied forces. The D3A was normally referred to as Type 99 navy dive bomber, the B5N as the Type 97 navy torpedo bomber and the A6M as the Type 0 navy fighter; it was also known as the "Zero". Parshall and Tully ''Shattered Sword'' pp.78-80.|group=nb}} However, the carriers of the ''[[Kido Butai]]'' were suffering from a shortage of frontline aircraft. For various reasons, production of the D3A had been drastically reduced, while that of the B5N had been stopped completely.<ref>Parshall and Tully ''Shattered Sword'' p.89.</ref> As a consequence, there were none available to replace losses. This also meant that many of the aircraft being used during the June 1942 operations had been operational since late November 1941; although well maintained, they were almost worn out and had become increasingly unreliable. These factors meant that all carriers had fewer than their normal aircraft complement and few spare aircraft.<ref>Parshall and Tully ''Shattered Sword'' pp. 89-91.</ref>

Japanese strategic scouting arrangements prior to the battle were also in disarray. A picket line of Japanese [[submarine]]s was late getting into position (partly because of Yamamoto's haste), which let the American carriers reach their assembly point northeast of Midway (known as "Point Luck") without being detected.<ref>Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin,'' p. 351; Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 98<U+2013>99.</ref> A second attempt at reconnaissance, using four-engine [[Kawanishi H8K]] [[flying boat]]s to scout Pearl Harbor prior to the battle (and thereby detect the absence or presence of the American carriers), part of [[Operation K]], was also thwarted when Japanese submarines assigned to refuel the search aircraft discovered that the intended refueling point<U+2014>a hitherto deserted bay off [[French Frigate Shoals]]<U+2014>was occupied by American warships (because the Japanese had carried out an identical mission in March).<ref>Lord, ''Incredible Victory'', pp. 37<U+2013>39; Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 99; Holmes, ''Double-Edged Secrets''.</ref> Thus, Japan was deprived of any knowledge concerning the movements of the American carriers immediately before the battle.

Japanese radio intercepts did notice an increase in both American submarine activity and message traffic. This information was in Yamamoto's hands prior to the battle. However, Japanese plans were not changed; Yamamoto, at sea on {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}}, did not dare inform Nagumo for fear of exposing his position and assumed that Nagumo had received the same signal from Tokyo.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 102<U+2013>104; Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin''.</ref> Nagumo's radio antennae, however, were unable to receive such long-wave transmissions, and he was left unaware of any American ship movements.<ref>Isom, ''Midway Inquest: Why the Japanese Lost the Battle of Midway'', pp.95-99</ref>

===Allied code-breaking===
Admiral Nimitz had one priceless asset: cryptanalysts had broken the [[JN-25]] code.<ref name=MS-134>Michael Smith, p.134</ref> Commander [[Joseph J. Rochefort]] and his team at [[Station Hypo]] were able to confirm Midway as the target of the impending Japanese strike, to determine the date of the attack as either 4 or 5 June, and to provide Nimitz with a complete [[Imperial Japanese Navy|IJN]] [[order of battle]].<ref name=MS-138-141>Michael Smith, pp. 138-141</ref> Japan's efforts to introduce a new codebook had been delayed, giving HYPO several crucial days; while it was blacked out shortly before the attack began, the important breaks had already been made.<ref>Holmes, ''Double-Edged Secrets''; Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin''.</ref>{{#tag:ref|There are occasional references to "deception", notably in the film [[Midway (film)|''Midway'']], referring to the false traffic before [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]; this reflects a complete misunderstanding of the issue.|group=nb}}

As a result, the Americans entered the battle with a very good picture of where, when, and in what strength the Japanese would appear. Nimitz was aware, for example, that the vast Japanese numerical superiority had been divided into no less than four task forces. This dispersal resulted in few fast ships being available to escort the Carrier Striking Force, limiting the [[anti-aircraft guns]] protecting the carriers. Nimitz thus calculated that his three carrier decks, plus Midway Island, to Yamamoto's four, gave the U.S. rough parity, especially since American carrier air groups were larger than Japanese ones. The Japanese, by contrast, remained almost totally unaware of their opponent's true strength and dispositions even after the battle began.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Initial air attacks===
The first air attack took off at 12:30 on 3 June, consisting of nine [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17s]] operating from Midway. Three hours later, they found the Japanese transport group {{convert|570|nmi|mi km|0|abbr=on}} to the west.<ref name=nimitz>Admiral Nimitz's [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/rep/Midway/Midway-CinCPac.html CinCPac report] of the battle.

Though hits were reported,<ref name=nimitz/> none of the bombs actually landed on target and no significant damage was inflicted.<ref name=toyama>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/USSBS/IJO/IJO-60.html Interrogation of: Captain TOYAMA, Yasumi, IJN; Chief of Staff Second Destroyer Squadron, flagship Jintsu (CL), at MIDWAY] USSBS From Hyperwar. Retrieved 14 February 2008.</ref> Early the following morning, Japanese oil tanker ''Akebono Maru'' sustained the first hit when a torpedo from an attacking [[PBY Catalina|PBY]] [[flying boat]] struck her around 01:00.<ref name=toyama/>

At 04:30 on 4 June, Nagumo launched his initial attack on Midway itself, consisting of 36 Aichi D3A dive-bombers and 36 Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers, escorted by 36 [[A6M Zero|Zero fighters]]. At the same time, he launched [[combat air patrol]] (CAP), as well as his eight search aircraft (one from the [[heavy cruiser]] [[Japanese cruiser Tone (1937)|''Tone'']] launched 30 minutes late due to technical difficulties).

Japanese reconnaissance arrangements were flimsy, with too few aircraft to adequately cover the assigned search areas, laboring under poor weather conditions to the northeast and east of the task force.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 107<U+2013>112, 132<U+2013>133.</ref> Yamamoto's faulty dispositions had now become a serious liability.<ref>Willmott, ''Barrier''.</ref>

American [[radar]] picked up the enemy at a distance of several miles and [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptors]] were soon scrambled. Unescorted bombers headed off to attack the Japanese carrier fleet, their fighter escorts remaining behind to defend Midway. At 06:20, Japanese carrier aircraft bombed and heavily damaged the U.S. base. Midway-based [[United States Marine Corps Aviation|Marine]] fighter pilots, flying obsolescent [[F4F Wildcat|F4F-3s]] and obsolete<ref>Stephen, Martin. ''Sea Battles in Close-up: World War Two'' (Shepperton, Surrey: Ian Allan, 1988), Volume 1, pp.166 & 167.</ref> [[Brewster Buffalo|F2A-3s]], intercepted the Japanese and suffered heavy losses, though they managed to destroy four bombers and at least three Zeros. Most of the U.S. planes were downed in the first few minutes; several were damaged, and only two remained flyable. In all, three F4Fs and 13 F2As were shot down. American anti-aircraft fire was accurate and intense, damaging many Japanese aircraft and claiming a third of the Japanese planes destroyed.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 200<U+2013>204.</ref>

The initial Japanese attack did not succeed in neutralizing Midway. American bombers could still use the airbase to refuel and attack the Japanese invasion force; another aerial attack would be necessary if troops were to go ashore by 7 June.<ref>Lord, ''Incredible Victory'', p. 110; Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 149.</ref>

Having taken off prior to the Japanese attack, American bombers based on Midway made several attacks on the Japanese carrier fleet. These included six [[TBF Avenger|TBFs]] from [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|''Hornet'']]{{'}}s [[VT-8]], their crews on their first combat operation, and four [[USAAF]] [[B-26 Marauder]]s armed with torpedoes. The Japanese shrugged off these attacks with almost no losses (as few as two fighters lost), while destroying all but one TBF and two B-26s. One B-26, hit by anti-aircraft fire from [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']], made no attempt to pull out of its run and narrowly missed crashing directly into the carrier's bridge. This experience may well have contributed to Nagumo's determination to launch another attack on Midway, in direct violation of Yamamoto's order to keep the reserve strike force armed for anti-ship operations.<ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'', pp. 207<U+2013>212; Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 149<U+2013>152.</ref>

This was one of several CAPs (Combat Air Patrols) launched during the day.<ref>Parshall and Tully ''Shattered Sword'' p.182</ref>]]

===Nagumo's decision===
Admiral Nagumo, in accordance with Japanese carrier [[military doctrine|doctrine]] at the time, had kept half of his aircraft in reserve. These comprised two squadrons each of dive bombers and torpedo bombers, the latter armed with torpedoes, should any American warships be located. The dive bombers were, as yet, unarmed.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp.130<U+2013>132.</ref> As a result of the attacks from Midway, as well as the morning flight leader's recommendation of a second strike, at 07:15, Nagumo ordered his reserve planes to be re-armed with contact-fused general purpose bombs for use against land targets. Some sources maintain that this had been underway for about 30 minutes when, at 07:40<ref>Lord, Walter. ''Incredible Victory''; Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin''; Fuchida & Okumiya, ''Midway''</ref> the delayed scout plane from ''Tone'' signaled the discovery of a sizable American naval force to the east; however, new evidence suggests Nagumo did not receive the sighting report until 08:00, so the rearming operation actually proceeded for 45 minutes.<ref>Isom, ''Midway Inquest: Why the Japanese Lost the Battle of Midway'', pp.129-139</ref> Nagumo quickly reversed his order and demanded the scout plane ascertain the composition of the American force. Another 40 minutes elapsed before ''Tone'''s scout finally radioed the presence of a single carrier in the American force, [[Task Force 16|TF 16]] (the other carrier being missed).<ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'', pp.216<U+2013>217; Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp.159<U+2013>161 & 183.</ref>

Nagumo was now in a quandary. Rear Admiral [[Tamon Yamaguchi]], leading Carrier Division 2 (''Hiry<U+016B>'' and ''S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>''), recommended Nagumo strike immediately with the forces at hand: 18 [[Aichi D3A]]2 dive bombers each on ''S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>'' and ''Hiry<U+016B>'', and half the ready cover patrol aircraft.<ref>Bicheno, Hugh. ''Midway'' (London: Orion Publishing Group, 2001), p.134.</ref> Nagumo's seeming opportunity to hit the American ships,<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp.165<U+2013>170.</ref> however, was now limited by the fact his Midway strike force would be returning shortly and needing to land promptly or ditch (as is commonly believed).<ref>Fuchida and Okumiya, ''Midway''; Willmott, ''Barrier & the Javelin''.</ref> Because of the constant flight deck activity associated with combat air patrol operations during the preceding hour, the Japanese never had an opportunity to "spot" (position) their reserve for launch. The few aircraft on the Japanese flight decks at the time of the attack were either defensive fighters, or (in the case of ''S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>'') fighters being spotted to augment the task force defenses.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 231, derived from ''Senshi S<U+014D>sh<U+014D>'', pp. 372<U+2013>378.</ref> Spotting his flight decks and launching aircraft would have required at least 30<U+2013>45 minutes.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp.121<U+2013>124.</ref> Furthermore, by spotting and launching immediately, Nagumo would be committing some of his reserve to battle without proper anti-ship armament; he had just witnessed how easily unescorted American bombers had been shot down.<ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway,'' p.233.</ref> (In the event, poor discipline saw many of the Japanese bombers ditch their bombs and attempt to dogfight interceptor F4Fs.)<ref>Bicheno, p.163.</ref> Japanese carrier doctrine preferred fully constituted strikes, and without confirmation (until 08:20) of whether the American force included carriers, Nagumo's reaction was doctrinaire.<ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway,'' pp.217<U+2013>218 & 372<U+2013>373; Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp.170<U+2013>173.</ref> In addition, the arrival of another American air strike at 07:53 gave weight to the need to attack the island again. In the end, Nagumo chose to wait for his first strike force to land, then launch the reserve, which would by then be properly armed and ready.<ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'', pp.231<U+2013>237; Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp.170<U+2013>173; Willmott, ''Barrier & the Javelin''; Fuchida & Okumiya, ''Midway''.</ref>

In the final analysis, it made no difference; Fletcher's carriers had launched beginning at 07:00, so the aircraft which would deliver the crushing blow were already on their way. There was nothing Nagumo could do about it. This was the fatal flaw of Yamamoto's dispositions: they followed strictly traditional battleship doctrine.<ref>Willmott, ''Barrier & the Javelin''; Fuchida & Okumiya, ''Midway''.</ref>

===Attacks on the Japanese fleet===
[[File:Vt8-g-gay-may42.jpg|thumb|[[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] [[George H. Gay, Jr.|George Gay]] (right), sole survivor of VT-8's [[TBD Devastator]] squadron, in front of his aircraft, 4 June 1942.]]
[[File:VT-6TBDs.jpg|thumbnail|right|Devastators of VT-6 aboard {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} being prepared for take off during the battle.]]

Meanwhile, the Americans had already launched their carrier aircraft against the Japanese. Admiral Fletcher, in overall command aboard ''Yorktown'', and benefiting from [[PBY Catalina|PBY]] patrol bomber sighting reports from the early morning, ordered Spruance to launch against the Japanese as soon as was practical, while initially holding ''Yorktown'' in reserve should there be any other Japanese carriers discovered.<ref>[http://www.cv6.org/1942/midway/default.htm Battle of Midway: June 4 - 6, 1942<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Fletcher's directions to Spruance were relayed via Nimitz who, unlike Yamamoto, had remained ashore. Spruance gave the order "Launch the attack" at around 06:00 and left Halsey's Chief of Staff, Captain [[Miles Browning]], to work out the details and oversee the launch. It took until a few minutes after 07:00 before the first plane was able to depart from Spruance's carriers, ''Enterprise'' and ''Hornet.'' Fletcher, upon completing his own scouting flights, followed suit at 08:00 from ''Yorktown''.<ref name="Cressman pp. 84">Cressman ''et al.'', ''A Glorious Page in Our History,'' pp. 84<U+2013>89; Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 215<U+2013>216; 226<U+2013>227; Buehl, ''The Quiet Warrior'' (1987), p. 494ff.</ref>

Ironically, Fletcher, ''Yorktown'' commanding officer Captain Elliott Buckmaster, and their staffs had acquired first-hand experience in organizing and launching a full strike against an enemy force from [[Battle of Coral Sea|Coral Sea]], but there was no time to pass these lessons to ''Enterprise'' and ''Hornet'' which were tasked with launching the first strike.<ref name="cv6.org">[http://www.cv6.org/1942/midway/midway_2.htm Battle of Midway: June 4 - 6, 1942<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Spruance gave his second crucial command, to run toward the target quickly, as neutralizing an enemy carrier was the key to their own carriers' survival. He judged that the need to throw something at the enemy as soon as possible was greater than the need for a coordinated attack among the different types of aircraft (fighters, bombers, torpedo planes). Accordingly, American squadrons were launched piecemeal and proceeded to the target in several different groups. The lack of coordination was expected to diminish the overall impact of the American attacks as well as increasing their casualties. However, Spruance calculated that this risk was worth it, since keeping the Japanese under aerial attack hampered their ability to launch a counterstrike (Japanese doctrine preferred fully constituted attacks), and he gambled that he could find Nagumo with his decks at their most vulnerable.<ref name="Cressman pp. 84"/><ref name="cv6.org"/>

American carrier aircraft had difficulty locating the target, despite the positions they had been given. The strike from ''Hornet'', led by Commander Stanhope C. Ring, followed an incorrect heading of 263 degrees rather than the 240 heading indicated by the contact report. As a result, Air Group Eight's dive bombers missed the Japanese carriers.<ref>Mrazek, Robert, "A Dawn Like Thunder", testimony from surviving pilots</ref> [[Torpedo Squadron 8]] (VT-8, from ''Hornet''), led by Lieutenant Commander [[John C. Waldron]] broke formation from Ring and followed the correct heading.  Waldron's squadron sighted the enemy carriers and began attacking at 09:20, followed by [[Torpedo Squadron 6]] (VT-6, from ''Enterprise'') at 09:40.<ref>Cressman ''et al.'', ''A Glorious Page in Our History'', pp. 91<U+2013>94.</ref> Without fighter escort, every [[TBD Devastator]] of VT-8 was shot down without being able to inflict any damage, with Ensign [[George H. Gay, Jr.]] the only survivor. VT-6 met nearly the same fate, with no hits to show for its effort, thanks in part to the abysmal performance of their [[Mark 13 torpedo|Mark 13]] aircraft torpedoes;<ref>Blair, ''Silent Victory'', p.238.</ref> senior Navy and [[Bureau of Ordnance|BuOrd]] officers never questioned why half a dozen torpeodes, released so close to the Japanese carriers, produced no results.<ref>Crenshaw Jr., Russell S. <U+2018><U+2019>The Battle of Tassafaronga<U+2019><U+2019>,  p. 158.</ref> The Japanese combat air patrol, flying the much faster [[Mitsubishi Zero|Mitsubishi A6M2 "Zeros"]], made short work of the unescorted, slow, under-armed TBDs. A few TBDs managed to get within a few ship-lengths range of their targets before dropping their torpedoes, being close enough to be able to strafe the enemy ships and force the Japanese carriers to make sharp evasive maneuvers.<ref name="ReferenceB">[http://www.cv6.org/1942/midway/midway_3.htm Battle of Midway: June 4 - 6, 1942<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Despite their losses, the American torpedo attacks indirectly achieved three important results. First, they kept the Japanese carriers off balance, with no ability to prepare and launch their own counterstrike. Second, their attacks pulled the Japanese combat air patrol out of position. Third, many of the Zeros ran low on ammunition and fuel.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 215<U+2013>216; 226<U+2013>227.</ref> The appearance of a third torpedo plane attack from the southeast by [[Torpedo Squadron 3]] (VT-3) at 10:00 very quickly drew the majority of the Japanese CAP to the southeast quadrant of the fleet.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 226<U+2013>227.</ref> Better discipline, and employment of all the Zeroes aboard, might have enabled Nagumo to succeed.<ref>Bicheno, ''Midway'', p.62.</ref>

By chance, at the same time VT-3 was sighted by the Japanese, two squadrons of American [[SBD Dauntless]] dive bombers from ''Enterprise'' and ''Yorktown'', VB-6 and VB-3 respectively, were approaching the Japanese fleet from the northeast and southwest. They were running low on fuel because of the time spent looking for the enemy. However, squadron commander [[C. Wade McClusky, Jr.]] decided to continue the search and by good fortune saw the wake of the Japanese destroyer ''Arashi''. The destroyer was steaming at full speed to rejoin Nagumo's carrier force after having unsuccessfully [[depth-charge]]d the U.S. submarine {{USS|Nautilus|SS-168|2}}, which had earlier unsuccessfully attacked the battleship {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kirishima||2}}.<ref name="kirishimamove">{{Cite web| last = | first = year = 2006 | url = http://www.combinedfleet.com/Kirishima.html | title = IJN KIRISHIMA: Tabular Record of Movement | work = Senkan! | publisher = combinedfleet.com | accessdate = 6 June 2007}}</ref>  Some bombers were lost from fuel exhaustion before the attack commenced.<ref>Tillman (1976) pp.69-73</ref>

''Enterprise''{{'}}s VB-6 air group split up and attacked two targets. Beginning at 10:22, McCluskey and his wingmen scored hits on ''Kaga'', while to the north ''Akagi'' was attacked four minutes later by three bombers.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> ''Yorktown''{{'}}s VB-3 commanded by [[Max Leslie]] went for ''S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>'' scoring hits. Simultaneously, VT-3 targeted ''Hiry<U+016B>'', which was sandwiched between ''S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>'', ''Kaga'', and ''Akagi'', but scored no hits. The dive-bombers, within six minutes, left ''S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>'' and ''Kaga'' ablaze. ''Akagi'' was hit by just one bomb, which penetrated to the upper hangar deck and exploded among the armed and fueled aircraft there. One bomb exploded underwater very close astern, the resulting geyser bending the flight deck upward and also causing crucial rudder damage.{{#tag:ref|Other sources claim a stern hit, but Parshall and Tully in ''Shattered Sword'', pp.253<U+2013>354 and 256<U+2013>259, make a case for a near miss, because of rudder damage from a high explosive bomb.|group=nb}} ''S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>'' took three bombs in her hangar deck; ''Kaga'', at least four, possibly five.

===Japanese counterattacks===
[[File:USS Yorktown hit-740px.jpg|thumb|''Yorktown'' hit by an air-launched torpedo.]]

''Hiry<U+016B>'', the sole surviving Japanese aircraft carrier, wasted little time in counterattacking. The first wave of Japanese dive bombers badly damaged ''Yorktown'' with three bomb hits that snuffed out her boilers, immobilizing her, yet her damage control teams patched her up so effectively (in about an hour) that the second wave's torpedo bombers mistook her for an undamaged carrier.<ref>Ballard, Robert D. and Archbold, Rick. ''Return to Midway.'' Madison Press Books: Toronto ISBN 0792275004</ref> Despite Japanese hopes to even the odds by eliminating two carriers with two strikes, ''Yorktown'' absorbed both Japanese attacks, the second wave mistakenly believing ''Yorktown'' had already been sunk and that they were attacking ''Enterprise''. After two torpedo hits, ''Yorktown'' lost power and developed a 26<U+00B0> list to port, which put her out of action and forced Admiral Fletcher to move his command staff to the heavy cruiser {{USS|Astoria|CA-34|2}}. Both carriers of Spruance's Task Force 16 were undamaged.
<ref>Parshall and Tully ''Shattered Sword'', p. 318.</ref>

News of the two strikes, with the reports that each had sunk an American carrier, greatly improved morale in the ''[[Kido Butai]]''. Its few surviving aircraft were all recovered aboard ''Hiry<U+016B>'', where they were prepared for a strike against what was believed to be the only remaining American carrier.<ref>Parshall and Tully ''Shattered Sword'', p. 323.</ref>
[[File:Hiryu burning.jpg|thumb|''Hiry<U+016B>'', shortly before sinking]]

Late in the afternoon, a ''Yorktown'' scout aircraft located ''Hiry<U+016B>'', prompting ''Enterprise'' to launch a final strike of dive bombers (including 10 bombers from ''Yorktown''). This delivered a killing blow, leaving ''Hiry<U+016B>'' ablaze, despite being defended by a strong cover of more than a dozen Zero fighters. Vice Admiral Yamaguchi chose to go down with his ship when she sank on June 5, costing Japan perhaps her best carrier sailor. ''Hornet''{{'}}s strike, launching late because of a communications error, concentrated on the remaining escort ships, but failed to score any hits.<ref>Parshall and Tully ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 328-329.</ref>

As darkness fell, both sides took stock and made tentative plans for continuing the action. Admiral Fletcher, obliged to abandon derelict ''Yorktown'' and feeling he could not adequately command from a cruiser, ceded operational command to Spruance. Spruance knew the United States had won a great victory, but was still unsure of what Japanese forces remained and was determined to safeguard both Midway and his carriers. To aid his aviators, who had launched at extreme range, he had continued to close with Nagumo during the day, and persisted as night fell. Fearing a possible night encounter with Japanese surface forces,<ref>Potter & Nimitz 1960 p.682</ref> Spruance changed course and withdrew to the east, turning back west towards the enemy at midnight.

For his part, Yamamoto initially decided to continue the engagement and sent his remaining surface forces searching eastward for the American carriers. Simultaneously, a cruiser raiding force was detached to bombard the island. The Japanese surface forces failed to make contact with the Americans due to Spruance's decision to briefly withdraw eastward, and Yamamoto ordered a general retirement to the west.<ref>Parshall and Tully ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 382-383.</ref>

American search planes failed to detect the retiring Japanese task forces on 5 June. An afternoon strike narrowly missed detecting Yamamoto's main body and failed to score hits on a straggling Japanese destroyer. The strike planes returned to the carriers after nightfall, prompting Spruance to order ''Enterprise'' and ''Hornet'' to turn on searchlights in order to aid their landings.{{#tag:ref|[[Marc Mitscher]], commanding ''Hornet'', would two years later issue the same order as the carrier force commander under similar circumstances during the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]].|group=nb}}

At 02:15 on 5/6 June, Commander John Murphy's {{USS|Tambor|SS-198|2}}, lying some {{convert|90|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} west of Midway, made the second of the Submarine Force's two major contributions to the battle's outcome. Sighting several ships, he (along with his exec, Ray Spruance, Jr.) could not identify them (and feared they might be friendly, so he held fire), but reported their presence, omitting their course. This went to Admiral Robert English, Commander, Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet ([[COMSUBPAC]]), and from him through Nimitz to the senior Spruance. Unaware of the exact location of Yamamoto's "Main Body" (a persistent problem since PBYs had first sighted the Japanese), Spruance presumed this was the invasion force. Thus, he moved to block it, taking station some {{convert|100|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} northeast of Midway; this frustrated Yamamoto's efforts, and the night passed without any contact between the opposing forces.<ref name="prange_320">Prange, ''Miracle at Midway,'' p. 320; Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 345.</ref>

Actually, this was Yamamoto's bombardment group of four cruisers and two destroyers, which at 02:55 was ordered to retire west with the rest of his force.<ref name="prange_320" /> ''Tambor'' was sighted around the same time; turning to avoid her, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Mogami|1934|2}} and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Mikuma||2}} collided, inflicting serious damage to ''Mogami''{{'}}s bow, the most any of the 18<ref>Blair, ''Silent Victory'', chart p.240.</ref> submarines deployed for the battle achieved. Only at 04:12 did the sky brighten enough for Murphy to be certain the ships were Japanese, by which time staying surfaced was a hazard, and he dived<!--this is the correct Sub Force usage, don't change it--> to approach for an attack. This was unsuccessful, and at around 06:00, he finally reported two ''Mogami''-class cruisers, westbound, placing Spruance at least {{convert|100|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} out of position.<ref>Blair, ''Silent Victory'', pp.246<U+2013>7.</ref> It may have been fortunate Spruance did not pursue, for had he come in contact with Yamamoto's heavy ships, including ''Yamato'', in the dark, his cruisers would have been overwhelmed, and his carriers helpless.<ref>Blair, ''Silent Victory'', pp.246<U+2013>7; Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin''.</ref> (At that time, only Britain's [[Fleet Air Arm]] was capable of night carrier operations.){{#tag:ref|Thanks in part to the slow speed of the [[Fairey Aviation Company|Fairey]] [[Fairey Swordfish|Swordfish]].

Over the following two days, first Midway and then Spruance's carriers launched several successive strikes against the stragglers. ''Mikuma'' was eventually sunk by Dauntlesses,<ref name="NatlGeo1999">{{Cite journal| last = Allen | first = Thomas B. | title = '''Return to the Battle of MIDWAY''' | journal = National Geographic, ''Journal of the National Geographic Society'', Wash.

Meanwhile, salvage efforts on ''Yorktown'' were encouraging and she was taken in tow by USS ''Vireo'', until late afternoon on 6 June when ''Yorktown'' was struck by two torpedoes from {{Ship|Japanese submarine|I-168||2}}. There were few casualties aboard ''Yorktown'', since most of the crew had already been evacuated, but a third torpedo from this salvo also struck and sank the destroyer {{USS|Hammann|DD-412|6}}, which had been providing auxiliary power to ''Yorktown''. ''Hammann'' broke in two with the loss of 80 lives, most due to her own depth charges exploding. ''Yorktown'' lingered until just after 05:00 on 7 June.<ref>Parshall and Tully ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 374-375, 383.</ref>

==Casualties==
By the time the battle ended, 3,057 Japanese had died. The four carriers sunk and their casualties were:
''Akagi'': 267; ''Kaga'': 811; ''Hiryu'': 392; ''Soryu'': 711; a combined total of 2,181.<ref>Parshall  and Tully, ''Shattered  Sword'', p. 476.</ref> The heavy cruisers ''Mikuma'' (sunk): 700; and ''Mogami'' (badly damaged): 92; between them took a total of 792 casualties.<ref>Parshall  and Tully, ''Shattered  Sword'', pp.378, 380.</ref>

In addition, the destroyers ''Arashio'' (bombed): 35; and ''Asashio'' (strafed by aircraft): 21; were both attacked while escorting the damaged heavy cruisers. Floatplanes were lost from the cruisers ''Chikuma'': 3; and ''Tone'': 2. Dead aboard the destroyers ''Tanikaze'': 11; ''Arashi'': 1; ''Kazagumo'': 1; and the fleet oiler ''Akebono Maru'': 10; make up the remaining 23 casualties.{{#tag:ref|Japanese casualty figures for the battle were compiled by Sawaichi Hisae for her book ''Midowei Kaisen: Kiroku'' p. 550: the list was compiled from Japanese prefectural records and is the most accurate to date.<ref name="ParTulcas"/>|group=nb}}

==Aftermath==
After winning a clear victory, and as pursuit became too hazardous near Wake,<ref name=Blair247>Blair, ''Silent Victory'', p.247.</ref> American forces retired. Historian Samuel E. Morison wrote in 1949 that Spruance was subjected to much criticism for not pursuing the retreating Japanese, and allowing the retreating Japanese surface fleet to escape.<ref>Morison, Coral Sea, Midway and Submarine Actions: May 1942<U+2013>August 1942. (History of United States Naval Operations in World War II), Volume IV, p. 142</ref> Clay Blair argued in 1975 that had Spruance pressed on, he would have been unable to launch his aircraft after nightfall, and his cruiser escorts would have been overwhelmed by Yamamoto's larger and more powerful surface units, including {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}}.<ref name=Blair247/> And with his torpedo bombers lost it is doubtful that his aircraft would have been effective against battleships.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}<!-- fact tag for just the last sentence -->

On 10 June, the Imperial Japanese Navy conveyed to the military liaison conference an incomplete picture of the results of the battle, on the ground the real extent of damage was a military secret not to be entrusted to all members. Japanese news announced a great victory. Only a few such as Emperor [[Hirohito]] were accurately informed of the carrier and pilot losses, so Army planners continued to believe (for at least a short time) that the fleet was in good condition.<ref>[[Herbert Bix]], ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan'', 2001, p. 449</ref>

On the return of the Japanese fleet to [[Hashirajima]] on 14 June the wounded were immediately transferred to naval hospitals; most were classified as "secret patients", placed in isolation wards and quarantined from other patients and their own families to prevent the secret of this major defeat from getting out to the general populace.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p.386.</ref> The remaining officers and men were quickly dispersed to other units of the fleet and, with no chance to see family or friends, were shipped to units in the South Pacific where the majority died.<ref>Parshall  and Tully, ''Shattered  Sword'', pp.386-387.</ref> By contrast none of the flag officers or staff of the Combined Fleet were penalized, with Nagumo being placed in command of the new carrier force.<ref>Parshall  and Tully, ''Shattered  Sword'', p.388.</ref>

The Japanese Navy did learn some lessons from Midway: new procedures were adopted whereby more aircraft were refueled and re-armed on the flight deck, rather than in the hangars, and the practice of draining all unused fuel lines was adopted. The new carriers being built were redesigned to incorporate only two flight deck elevators and new firefighting equipment. More carrier crew members were trained in damage-control and firefighting techniques, although the losses later in the war of {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh<U+014D>kaku||2}}, ''{{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiy<U+014D>||2}}'' and ''{{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Taih<U+014D>||2}}'' showed that there were still problems in this area.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp.388-389.</ref> Replacement pilots went through an abbreviated training regimen, meeting the short-term needs of the fleet; however, this led to a decline in the quality of training.  These inexperienced pilots were fed into front-line units, while the veterans who remained after Midway and the Solomons campaign were forced to share an increased workload in increasingly desperate conditions, with few being given a chance to rest in rear areas or in the home islands. As a result, Japanese naval air groups progressively declined in overall quality during the war.<ref>Parshall   and Tully, ''Shattered   Sword'', pp.390-391.</ref>

Barde, "Midway: Tarnished Victory", ''Military Affairs'', v. 47, no. 4 (December 1983), pp. 188<U+2013>192.</ref> The report filed by Admiral Nagumo states of Ensign Osmus, "He died on 6 June and was buried at sea". Nagumo recorded obtaining seven items of information, including the enemy's strength, but did not mention the death of O'Flaherty or Gaido.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 563.</ref>

==Impact==
The battle has often been called "the turning point of the Pacific".<ref>Dull, p.166; Prange, p.395.</ref> However, the Japanese continued to try to advance in the South Pacific, and it was many more months before the U.S. moved from a state of naval parity to one of increasingly clear supremacy.<ref>Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin,'' pp.522<U+2013>523; Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp.416<U+2013>430.</ref> Thus, although Midway was the [[Allies of World War II|Allies']] first major victory against the Japanese, it did not change the course of the war in the same sense as [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]]; instead, it was the cumulative attrition of Midway, combined with that of the inconclusive [[Battle of Coral Sea|Coral Sea battle]], which reduced Japan's ability to undertake major offensives.<ref name="U.S" /> Midway also paved the way for the landings on [[Guadalcanal]] and the prolonged [[attrition warfare|attrition]] of the [[Solomon Islands campaign]], which allowed the Allies to take the strategic initiative and swing to the offensive for the rest of the [[Pacific War]].<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 422-423.</ref>

The battle showed the worth of pre-war naval cryptologic training and efforts. These efforts continued and were expanded throughout the war in both the Pacific and Atlantic theaters. Successes were numerous and significant. For instance, the [[Operation Vengeance|shooting down of Admiral Yamamoto's airplane]] was only possible because of navy cryptanalysis.

Some authors have stated heavy losses in carriers and veteran aircrews at Midway permanently weakened the Imperial Japanese Navy.<ref>Dull, ''The Imperial Japanese Navy: A Battle History,'' p.166; Willmott, ''The Barrier and the Javelin,'' pp.519<U+2013>523; Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'' p.395.</ref> Parshall and Tully, however, have pointed out that the losses in veteran aircrew, while heavy (110, just under 25% of the aircrew embarked on the four carriers),<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 432.</ref> was not crippling to the Japanese naval air-corps as a whole: the Japanese navy had some 2,000 carrier qualified aircrew at the start of the Pacific war.<ref name="Partull417">Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'',  p.417.</ref> A few months after Midway, the JNAF sustained similar casualty rates at both the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]] and [[Battle of Santa Cruz]], and it was these battles, combined with the constant attrition of veterans during the Solomons campaign,  which were the catalyst for the sharp downward spiral in operational capability.<ref name="Partul4167">Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp.416-417, 432.</ref> However, the loss of four large fleet carriers, and over 40% of the carriers' highly trained aircraft mechanics and technicians, plus the essential flight-deck crews and armorers, and the loss of organizational knowledge embodied by such highly trained crew, were heavy blows to the Japanese carrier fleet.<ref name="Partul4167"/>{{#tag:ref|Because pre-war Japan was less mechanised than America, the highly trained aircraft mechanics, fitters and technicians lost at Midway were all but impossible to replace and train to a similar level of efficiency.<ref name="Partull417"/>|group=nb}} The loss of the carriers meant that only {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh<U+014D>kaku||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}} were left for offensive actions. Of Japan's other carriers, {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Taih<U+014D>||2}} was the only Fleet carrier worth teaming with ''Sh<U+014D>kaku'' and ''Zuikaku'', while {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Junyo||2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiy<U+014D>||2}}, were second-rate ships of comparatively limited effectiveness.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 421.</ref> By the time of the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], while the Japanese had somewhat rebuilt their carrier forces, the planes were largely flown by inexperienced pilots so the carrier fleet was not as potent a striking force as it was before Midway. {{#tag:ref|{{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shinano||2}}, commissioned on 19 November 1944, was only the fourth fleet carrier commissioned by Japan during the war, after ''Taih<U+014D>'', ''Unry<U+016B>'', and ''Amagi''.Chesneau (ed.) ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1922-1946'' pp. 169-170, 183-184.|group=nb}}

In the time it took Japan to build three carriers, the U.S. Navy commissioned more than two dozen fleet and light fleet carriers, and numerous escort carriers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/economic.htm |title=Why Japan Really Lost The War - War Production |publisher=combinedfleet.com}}</ref> By 1942, the United States was already three years into a shipbuilding program, mandated by the [[Second Vinson Act]], intended to make the navy larger than Japan's.<ref>Hakim, ''A History of Us: War, Peace and all that Jazz''</ref> The greater part of USN aviators survived the Battle of Midway and subsequent battles of 1942, and combined with growing pilot training programs, the US was able to develop a large number of skilled pilots to complement its material advantages in ships and planes.

==Discovery of sunken vessels==
[[File:Sinking of japanese cruiser Mikuma 6 june 1942.jpg|thumb|left|{{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Mikuma||2}} shortly before sinking]]

Because of the extreme depth of the ocean in the area of the battle (more than {{convert|17000|ft|m|abbr=on}}), researching the battlefield has presented extraordinary difficulties. However, on 19 May 1998, [[Robert Ballard]] and a team of scientists and Midway veterans (including Japanese participants) located and photographed ([http://www.amvetsww2.org/Assets/images/docimage/discovery_1-1.jpg artist's rendering]) ''Yorktown''. The ship was remarkably intact for a vessel that sank in 1942; much of the original equipment and even the original paint scheme were still visible.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/science/9806/04/yorktown.found/index.html|title=Titanic explorer finds Yorktown|date=4 June 1998|accessdate=1 July 2007|publisher=CNN}}</ref>

Ballard's subsequent search for the Japanese carriers was ultimately unsuccessful. In September 1999, a joint expedition between Nauticos Corp. and the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office searched for the Japanese aircraft carriers. Using advanced renavigation techniques in conjunction with the ship's log of the submarine USS ''Nautilus'', the expedition located a large piece of wreckage, subsequently identified as having come from the upper hangar deck of ''Kaga''.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 491<U+2013>493.</ref> The main wreck, however, has yet to be located.

==Other remembrances==
Chicago Municipal Airport, important to the war efforts in World War II, was renamed [[Chicago Midway International Airport]] (or simply Midway Airport) in 1949 in honor of the battle.

Waldron Field, an outlying training landing strip, at [[Corpus Christi NAS]] as well Waldron Road leading to the strip, was named in honor of the commander of [[USS_Hornet_(CV-8)|USS Hornet]]'s [[Torpedo Squadron 8]]. Yorktown Blvd leading away from the strip was named for the U.S. carrier sunk in the battle.

An [[escort carrier]], [[USS St. Lo (CVE-63)|USS Midway (CVE-63)]] was commissioned on 17 August 1943. She was renamed ''St. Lo'' on 10 October 1944 to clear the name ''Midway'' for a large fleet aircraft carrier, {{USS|Midway|CV-41}}, commissioned on 10 September 1945 (eight days after the Japanese surrender). The latter ship is now docked in [[San Diego]], California and is in use as the USS Midway Museum.
