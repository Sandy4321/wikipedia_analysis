'''Richard Nigel Cullen''' [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (5&nbsp;June 1917 &ndash; 4&nbsp;March 1941) was an Australian  [[flying ace|fighter ace]] of [[World War&nbsp;II]]. Serving with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), he was credited with sixteen aerial victories before being killed in action during the [[Battle of Greece]]. Born in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], New South Wales, Cullen was living in [[London]] and had already seen action in the [[Spanish Civil War]] when he joined the RAF in 1937. Following the outbreak of World War&nbsp;II, he served initially with No.&nbsp;267 Squadron in the [[Middle East Theatre of World War II|Middle East]], before seeking reassignment to fighters. He was then posted to [[No. 80 Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;80 Squadron]], flying [[Gloster Gladiator]] biplanes, and shot down six [[Axis powers|Axis]] aircraft before the unit converted to [[Hawker Hurricane]]s. Nicknamed "Ape" due to his physical bulk, Cullen was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for destroying five enemy aircraft in a single [[sortie]] on 28&nbsp;February 1941. He was credited with another four victories in the one engagement on 3&nbsp;March; the next day, he was  shot down and killed while on escort duty over [[Albania]], at the age of twenty-three.

==Early career==
Born in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], New South Wales on 5&nbsp;June 1917,<ref name="Newton">Newton, ''Australian Air Aces'', p. 83</ref> Nigel Cullen was the son of Horace David Cullen (originally Horace David Cohen) and his wife Hero.<ref>Baker, ''Paul Cullen, Citizen and Soldier'', p. 72</ref><ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=33967|startpage=32|date=8 August 1933|accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> The boy's uncle was future Major General [[Paul Cullen (general)|Paul Alfred Cullen]].<ref name="Pynt">Pynt; Epstein, ''Australian Jewry's Book of Honour'', pp. 19&ndash;22</ref>  Nigel was taken to England at an early age by his parents and attended [[Sherborne School]] in [[Dorset]], before studying at the College of Aero Engineering, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]. Fired by a love of adventure, he competed in motorbike racing at [[Brooklands]] in 1934, and later saw action as a member of the [[International Brigades]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]], suffering a wound to the stomach that necessitated repatriation to England.<ref name="Newton"/><ref name="Garrisson">Garrisson, ''Australian Fighter Aces'', p. 129</ref> When he caught up again with his friends from Brooklands, he was reticent to talk about the conflict except to say that "the wars of the future would be fought in the air".<ref name="Pynt"/>

Cullen was living in [[Putney]] when he joined the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in 1937, and was granted a short-service commission as an acting [[Pilot Officer]] on 9&nbsp;August.<ref name="Shores">Shores, ''Aces High'', p. 129</ref><ref>{{LondonGazette|issue= 34429 |startpage=5388|date=24 August 1937|accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> Completing his probation the following May, he was promoted to [[Flying Officer]] on 31&nbsp;December 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War&nbsp;II.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue= 34521 |startpage=3833|date=14 June 1938|accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{LondonGazette|issue= 34769 |startpage=164|date=9 January 1940|accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> Posted to the [[Middle East Theatre of World War II|Middle East]], his early wartime service was with No.&nbsp;267 Squadron, a transport unit ferrying passengers and freight to and from Egypt.<ref name="Newton"/><ref>[http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/267squadron.cfm 267 Squadron] at [[Royal Air Force]]. Retrieved on 12 May 2010.</ref> "[[Wikt:browned off|Browned off]]" with transport duties, however, he sought reassignment to fighters and before long was able to wangle a transfer to [[No. 80 Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;80 Squadron]], flying [[Gloster Gladiator]] biplanes, a type that was obsolescent well before the war began.<ref name="Newton"/><ref name="Pynt"/>

==Fighter pilot==
===Gladiators===
After joining No.&nbsp;80 Squadron in the [[Western Desert Campaign]], Cullen was schooled in fighter tactics by [[Marmaduke Pattle|"Pat" Pattle]], one of the leading British aces of the war.<ref name="Garrisson"/> Nicknamed "Ape" by his colleagues due to his imposing physique,<ref name="Newton"/><ref name="Mordike">Mordike, ''The RAAF in Europe and North Africa 1939&ndash;1945'', p. 111</ref> Cullen was described by a fellow pilot as "a big, smiling, long-armed giant from Putney, with an irresistible offensive spirit and quite fearless".<ref>Holmes, ''Gloster Gladiator Aces'', p. 64</ref> He was "[[Wikt:blooded|blooded]]" on 9&nbsp;October, after being detailed to search single-handedly for a missing Allied truck. Failing to locate the vehicle, he spotted five Italian [[Breda Ba.65]] ground-attack aircraft south of [[Sidi Barrani]] and immediately engaged them, gaining credit for probably destroying one. The squadron redeployed to Greece the following month, to assist in resisting the [[Battle of Greece|Italian invasion]]. There Cullen achieved his first confirmed victory, over a [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.81]] three-engined bomber near the [[Pallene, Chalcidice|Kassandra Peninsula]] on 30&nbsp;December.<ref name="Newton"/><ref name="Pynt"/> He was promoted to [[Flight Lieutenant]] the next day.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue= 35076 |startpage=901|endpage=902|date=14 February 1941|accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> 

[[File:ZZZ 003915 E Gladiator.jpg|thumb|left|325px|RAF Gloster Gladiator based in the Mediterranean theatre, 1940|alt=Single-engined military biplane parked on airfield]]
Cullen claimed his second "kill", a [[CANT Z.1007]] bomber, on 28&nbsp;January 1941, before  destroying a [[Fiat CR.42]] fighter and a [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]] bomber on successive days, 9 and 10&nbsp;February respectively. He then recorded two victories in one mission on 20&nbsp;February, over [[K<U+00EB>lcyr<U+00EB>|Kelcyre]], Albania. After sending a [[Fiat G.50]] down in flames while escorting Allied bombers, he discovered two formations of CR.42s nearby and shot down one of them as well. Cullen later remarked, "The others made off at once. Just as well&mdash;I hadn't any ammo left." He had also been slightly wounded in the hand by a bullet.<ref name="Newton"/><ref name="Pynt"/> On 23&nbsp;February, he attacked a [[CANT Z.506]] three-engined floatplane as it was taking off at [[Preveza]] in Greece, at first simply attempting to prevent it from getting airborne but then, when it refused to stop, destroying it on a second pass. The result did not add to his official score, however, as the Italian plane was not in full flight at the time of its destruction.<ref name="Newton"/><ref name="Garrisson"/> 

===Hurricanes===
By the time No.&nbsp;80 Squadron began re-equipping with [[Hawker Hurricane]]s in February 1941,<ref>[http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/80squadron.cfm 80 Squadron] at Royal Air Force. Retrieved on 12 May 2010.</ref> Cullen's total stood at six enemy aircraft destroyed, plus one probable.<ref>Holmes, ''Gloster Gladiator Aces'', p. 83</ref> He had earned a reputation for extreme aggression and doggedness in the air. His favourite tactic was to duel head-on with his intended victim, two aircraft firing at each other with a closing speed of over {{convert|500|mph|kph}}; he was quoted as saying, "It's always interesting to see who will pull away first". His colleagues reportedly said of him, "He never came out of a fight while a single enemy aircraft was left in the sky to give battle. He came home only when his guns were empty."<ref name="Pynt"/> Cullen opened his score in the Hurricane on 27&nbsp;February, shooting down a Fiat CR.42 while escorting [[Bristol Blenheim]] light bombers to [[Vlor<U+00EB>|Valona]], Albania.<ref name="Newton"/> The day after, in what has been described as "the greatest air battle of this period", he was officially credited with shooting down five Italian planes in the one engagement, a record for his unit.<ref name="Garrisson"/><ref name="Herington">Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/01.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', p. 20]</ref> His combat report read:<ref name="Hurricane Aces">Holmes, ''Hurricane Aces 1941&ndash;45'', p. 34</ref> 
{{quote|The battle exended right across Albania. First, I found four Breda 20s. I got one, which went down in flames. There we found three formations of SM.79s. I took on one and aimed at the starboard engine. It caught fire and crashed in flames. I climbed and dived on the next. He too crashed in flames. Then we attacked ten CR.42s, climbing to get above them. I got behind one, and he caught fire and went down in flames. Up again immediately &ndash; dived, fired into the cockpit and another one took fire, rolled over and crashed. I had to come home then &ndash; no more ammo.}}

For his achievements on 28&nbsp;February, the RAF's most successful day of the campaign, Cullen was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC).<ref name="Hurricane Aces"/>  He achieved further success on 3&nbsp;March, when he and one of his comrades chased a group of CANT Z.1007s that had just bombed [[Larissa]], Greece. Catching the retreating bombers south-west of [[Corfu]], Cullen destroyed four of them and was also credited with one probable.  The following day he was escorting a group of Blenheims near [[Himar<U+00EB>]] in southern Albania when he was attacked by Fiat G.50s, shot down and killed.<ref name="Newton"/><ref name="Pynt"/><ref name="Herington"/>  He was twenty-three years old.<ref name="Garrisson"/> The citation for his DFC was promulgated in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 14&nbsp;March:<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue= 35106|startpage=1523|date=14 March 1941|accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref>
{{quote|Flight Lieutenant Richard Nigel CULLEN (39967), No. 80 Squadron.
In February, 1941, this officer was pilot of one of a formation of aircraft which attacked a large force of enemy bombers escorted by at least 30 fighters. Displaying remarkable skill, Flight Lieutenant Cullen shot down five of the enemy's aircraft in the ensuing action. He has now destroyed 11 enemy aircraft and has consistently shown great resource and courage.}}

Although the [[Australia in the War of 1939<U+2013>1945|official history of Australia in the war]] puts the number of Cullen's victories at thirteen,<ref name="Herington"/> his total score is more commonly estimated as sixteen,<ref name="Newton"/><ref name="Pynt"/><ref name="Garrisson"/> or sixteen-and-a-half.<ref name="Newton"/><ref name="Shores"/> He is buried in Tirana Park Memorial Cemetery, [[Tirana]], Albania.<ref name="CWGC">[http://www.cwgc.org/search/casualty_details.aspx?casualty=2241608 Casualty Details: Cullen, Richard Nigel] at [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]].
