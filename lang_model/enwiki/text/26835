'''Heart Warming''' was a [[gospel music|gospel]] [[record label]] started by [[Bob Benson (record producer)|Bob Benson]] and his father, John T. Benson Jr. Heart Warming and their chief rival [[Canaan Records]] (owned by [[Word Records]]) were arguably the two biggest and best gospel labels in their time. The [[Oak Ridge Boys]], [[Stamps Quartet]], [[The Imperials|Jake Hess & The Imperials]], [[Dottie Rambo]], [[Bill Gaither Trio]] and [[Speer Family]] all signed to it and had many recordings on it. The [[Cathedral Quartet]] produced two of their most popular albums on it [[With Brass]] and [[With Strings]].

Producers for the label included Bob Benson, Bob MacKenzie, and Don Light. Bob MacKenzie in particular produced some of the best gospel albums of that era and some of the best albums of the groups above.

Eventually the Benson company dropped the Heart Warming label instead having [[RiverSong]] be the southern gospel division and [[Impact Records (gospel)|Impact Records]] and later [[Benson Records|Benson]] labels be their contemporary labels.

Finally in [[2006]] it was announced that Heart Warming, along with [[RiverSong]] was sold to [[Homeland Entertainment Group]], former President of [[Zondervan Music Group]], Bob Jones Jr is part owner of the company.
