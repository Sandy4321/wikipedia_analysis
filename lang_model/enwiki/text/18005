==Plot==
When [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] finds his mother educating Cartman on [[Passover]], because of a claimed interest in Jewish culture on [[Cartman]]'s part, Kyle is suspicious. Cartman tells Kyle and his other schoolmates of a blood-sucking creature called "[[chupacabra|Jewpacabra]]" that preys on children, and mentions reports of incidents that he implies are the result of the creature. Kyle denounces this idea, and accuses Cartman of spreading lies, as there is no such creature. Cartman does not relent in his efforts, taking [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] with him to hunt the Jewpacabra, and showing video tape of their efforts to the executives of Sooper Foods, in an attempt to convince them to cancel their Easter egg hunt. 

The executives show the video to a team of experts at the [[Cryptozoology|Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization]] (BFRO), who confirm that it is evidence of an actual Jewpacabra, and tell Cartman that the creature will come after him because he exposed its existence. This frightens Cartman into hiding in a church with [[Token Black|Token]], [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] and Butters, whom Cartman pays to protect him. Cartman is nonetheless abducted by the Sooper Foods executives, who dress him in an Easter bunny costume and chain him to a cement block in a field in order to sacrifice him to the Jewpacabra, which will make the Easter egg hunt possible. When Kyle appears before Cartman, Cartman pleads with him to help him escape, but when Kyle says he will only do so if Cartman admits he lied about the Jewpacabra, Cartman's inability to be honest about what caused his predicament causes Kyle to abandon him. BFRO then see Cartman and think he is a real life "Bunny-Man", so they shoot him with a [[Ketamine|tranquilizer]] and hope to make an [[Animal Planet]] program documenting their capture, but instead of taking Cartman as their evidence, they take the gun with which they shot him.

Cartman then experiences a tranquilizer-induced [[dream]] about the [[Plagues of Egypt]], in which he is the son of the [[Pharaoh]], and eventually dies from the [[Plagues of Egypt#10. Death of the firstborn (<U+05DE><U+05B7><U+05DB><U+05B7><U+05BC><U+05EA> <U+05D1><U+05B0><U+05BC><U+05DB><U+05D5><U+05B9><U+05E8><U+05D5><U+05B9><U+05EA>): Ex. 11:1<U+2013>12:36|tenth plague]]. Meanwhile, Kyle has a change of heart and frees the unconscious Cartman from his captivity, takes him home, and puts him to bed. When Cartman awakens with no knowledge of how he got home, he experiences a religious epiphany, and announces to everyone at the Easter egg hunt that he has converted to Judaism. When he tells everyone that they should convert too by recognizing Jehovah as their true God and [[Judaism's view of Jesus|denying Christ]], the assembled Christians label Cartman as a heathen and return to their hunt. Cartman apologizes to Kyle, saying he now knows what he feels like to be mocked by others for being Jewish, and the two wish each other a Happy [[Passover]]. The camera then pans up to a [[Star of David]] shining at the center of the Sun.

==Critical reaction==
Jacob Kleinman of the ''[[International Business Times]]'' though the episode was generally "solid", though not as funny as [[Faith Hilling|the previous week's episode]]. Kleinman singled out the ancient Egypt sequence as his favorite, and also thought that the manner in which Cartman's Jewpacabra stories backfired on him were "hilarious, historic and extremely shocking".<ref name="ibt">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/324593/20120405/south-park-jewpacabra-new-episode-cartman-video.htm|title=New South Park Episode 'Jewpacabra' Takes On Easter, Passover, Chupacabra|publisher=[[International Business Times]]|date=April 5, 20122|author=Kleinman, Jacob}}</ref>
