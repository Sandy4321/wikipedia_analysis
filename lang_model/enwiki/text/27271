The '''eighth season''' of the American [[science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]'' commenced airing in the United States on November 5, 2000, concluded on May 20, 2001, and consisted of twenty-one episodes. Season eight takes place after [[Fox Mulder]]'s [[Colonist (The X-Files)|alien abduction]] in the [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh season]]. The [[story arc]] for the search of Mulder continues until the second half of the season, when a new arc about [[Dana Scully]]'s [[pregnancy]] is formed. This arc would continue, and end, with the [[The X-Files (season 9)|next season]]. The season explores various themes such as life, death, and belief.

Season eight was received well by critics but got more mixed reviews by fans and viewers, since [[David Duchovny]] elected not to return as a [[main character]]. Duchovny was initially replaced by [[Robert Patrick]] who played new central character [[John Doggett]]. Duchovny appeared for only twelve episodes in season eight, and reduced his time on ''The X-Files'' dramatically in [[The X-Files (season 9)|season 9]]. "[[This Is Not Happening]]" marked the first appearance of [[Annabeth Gish]] as [[Monica Reyes]], who would become a main character in [[The X-Files (season 9)|season 9]] as Doggett's new partner in [[X-File|the X-Files office]]. 

Series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] believed that the series could continue for another ten years with new leads, and the opening credits were accordingly redesigned in both seasons eight and nine. During the airing of season eight, Carter and ''The X-Files'' production team created and aired a [[spin-off (media)|spinoff]] titled ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|The Lone Gunmen]]''.

Reluctantly accepting Krycek's assistance, Mulder, Doggett and Skinner learn that an alien virus recently created in secret by members of the [[United States government]] have replaced several humans, including Miles and several high-ranking FBI personnel, with so-called alien "[[Super Soldiers (The X-Files)|Super Soldiers]]". Krycek claims that the soldiers are virtually unstoppable aliens who want to make sure that humans will not survive the colonisation of [[Earth]].

=== Themes ===
''The X-Files'' season 8 takes place in a [[science fiction]] environment and employs the common science fiction concepts of strongly differentiated characters fighting an unequivocally evil enemy, in this case, the alien [[Colonist (The X-Files)|Colonist]]s. The first episode of the season, "[[Within (The X-Files)|Within]]" explored "loss", "loneliness" and "pain" after the disappearance of Mulder.<ref name="book_part_one">Kessenich (2002), pp. 149.</ref> "[[Per Manum]]" included basic themes common in the series, such as "dark, foreboding terror", the" overriding sense of [[paranoia]]", and "the fear of the unknown", among others.<ref name="book_part_two">Kessenich (2002), pp. 156.</ref> Later on, death and resurrection emerged as a major sub-theme during the season, starting with "[[The Gift (The X-Files)|The Gift]]", wherein [[John Doggett]] is killed and resurrected, and later in "[[Deadalive]]" when Mulder is brought back to life after apparently being dead for three months. This sub-theme would continue well into the [[The X-Files (season 9)|ninth season]].<ref name="book_part_three">Kellner (2003), p. 155.</ref>

The [[Mythology of The X-Files|main story arc]] of the season dealt with the idea that, at times,  [[human]]ity is a greater danger to itself. This theme also explores the notion of human resurrection and [[salvation]] from ourself, symbolized by the [[Syndicate (The X-Files)|Syndicate and the human conspiracy]], and from the threat outside, represented by the aliens. Some other themes explored in the season include rebirth, life, and belief, as illustrated in the episode "[[This Is Not Happening]]" and "Deadalive".<ref name="book_part_three"/>

== Production ==
=== Development ===
[[File:Opening Sequence TXF.jpg|thumb|400px|The new opening sequence for season eight, featuring [[Robert Patrick]]]]
The [[original]] opening sequence was made in 1993 for the [[The X-Files (season 1)|first season]] and remained unchanged throughout the series, until [[David Duchovny]] partially left the show after the [[The X-Files (season 7)|season seven]]. The premiere episode of season eight, "[[Within (The X-Files)|Within]]", marked the first major change to the opening credits. The opening sequence now included new images, updated FBI badge photos for [[David Duchovny]] and [[Gillian Anderson]] and the addition of [[Robert Patrick]] to the main cast. Duchovny only features in the opening credits when he appears in an episode. The opening contains images of Scully's [[pregnancy]] and, according to [[Frank Spotnitz]], showed an "abstract" explanation of [[Fox Mulder]]'s absence in this season, with him falling into an eye.<ref name="The_Truth_Behind_Season_Eight">{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]], [[Robert Patrick|Patrick, Robert]], [[Frank Spotnitz|Spotnitz, Frank]] and [[Annabeth Gish|Gish, Annabeth]] |date=2002 |title=The Truth Behind Season 8 |medium= DVD |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>

"[[Patience (The X-Files)|Patience]]" was the first episode of the series without Duchovny. "[[Salvage (The X-Files)|Salvage]]" contains a reference to actor Patrick's (Doggett) perhaps most well-known role prior to ''The X-Files'', that of the liquid-metal [[T-1000]] [[android (robot)|android]] in ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991) &ndash; Doggett: "What<U+2019>re you saying? Ray Pearce has become some kind of metal man? <U+2018>Cause that only happens in the movies, Agent Scully." The title of the episode "[[This Is Not Happening]]" is said four times in the episode, three times at the start of the episode, and the fourth time by Scully.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Salvage (The X-Files) | title=Salvage | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Rod Hardy]] | writers = [[Jeffrey Bell]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 8 | number = 9}}</ref>

After the partial departure of Duchovny, Carter decided to focus almost solely on the character of Doggett during the first half of the season. This led to some unhappiness from the cast and critics, most notably Duchovny and Gillian Anderson.<ref name="kesss81"/><ref name="kesss82"/> According to Tom Kessenich in his book ''Examinations'', Anderson reportedly "wasn't thrilled" with the lack of attention her character was getting; instead, the writers were crafting episodes solely for Doggett because he was the show's new "voice".<ref name="kesss81"/><ref name="kesss82">Kessenich (2002), p. 144</ref> Duchovny, on the other hand, was unhappy because Mulder's abduction was never properly examined. Reportedly, Duchovny offered to write and direct an episode based around the conceit of Mulder being trapped in the alien spaceship, as seen in the season opener "[[Within (The X-Files)|Within]]" and "[[Without (The X-Files)|Without]]". Carter, however, nixed the idea because "it was not about Doggett."<ref name="kesss81">Kessenich (2002), p. 145</ref>

=== Casting ===
[[File:Robert Patrick.jpg|160px|thumb|right|[[Robert Patrick]] played [[John Doggett]] on the show]]
The [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh season]] was a time of closure for ''[[The X-Files]]''. Characters within the show were written out, including [[The Smoking Man]] and [[List of The X-Files characters#Teena Mulder|Mulder's mother]], and several plot threads were resolved, including the fate of Fox Mulder's sister [[Samantha Mulder|Samantha]]. After settling his contract dispute, Duchovny quit full-time participation in the show after the seventh season.<ref name=bbcnews>{{cite web |author=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1337685.stm |title=Duchovny quits X-Files |work=BBC News |date=May 18, 2001 |accessdate=July 5, 2009}}</ref> This contributed to uncertainties over the likelihood of an eighth season.<ref name=salon>{{cite web |author=Spencer, Russ |url=http://www.salon.com/2000/04/28/chriscarter/ |title=A close encounter with Chris Carter |work=Salon |date=April 28, 2000 |accessdate=July 5, 2009}}</ref> Carter and most fans felt the show was at its natural endpoint with Duchovny's departure, but it was decided Mulder would be [[alien abduction|abducted]] at the end of the seventh season, leaving it open for the actor's return in 11 episodes the following year.<ref name=space>{{cite web |author=Elber, Lynn |url=http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/tv/xfiles_duchovny_000518_wg.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040924004848/http://space.com/sciencefiction/tv/xfiles_duchovny_000518_wg.html |archivedate=September 24, 2004 |title=Fox Mulder 'Ready to Get Back to Work' |work=Associated Press / Space |date=May 18, 2000 |accessdate=July 5, 2009}}</ref> "[[Requiem (The X-Files)|Requiem]]", the [[season finale]], was written by Carter as a possible series finale. The producers found it difficult to write Duchovny's character out of the [[Script (performing arts)|script]], and explain Mulder's absence in the episodes of the upcoming season.<ref name="The_Truth_Behind_Season_Eight"/>

Hoping to continue the series, Carter introduced a new central character to replace Mulder: [[John Doggett]]. More than 100 actors auditioned for the role, with only about ten considered by the producers. [[Lou Diamond Phillips]] and [[Hart Bochner]] were among the auditionees, and Phillips, Bochner and [[Bruce Campbell]] (who played Wayne Weinsider in a previous episode of ''The X-Files'') were considered for the role, but the producers eventually choose [[Robert Patrick]].<ref name=doggettjohn>{{cite web |author=Fleming, Michael |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117784003 |title=Patrick marks 'X-Files' spot |work=Variety Magazine |date=July 20, 2000 |accessdate=July 5, 2009}}</ref> The season also introduced [[Monica Reyes]] (portrayed by [[Annabeth Gish]]), who would become a main character in the [[The X-Files (season 9)|following, and ultimately final, season]].

=== Crew ===
Series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] who also served as [[executive producer]] and [[showrunner]], along with executive producer [[Frank Spotnitz]] wrote the bulk of the episodes for the season, with 13 of the 21 episodes. Carter wrote five episodes solo, Spotnitz wrote four episodes solo, and they co-wrote four episodes together, including important mytharc episodes. The rest of the writing staff contributed one or two episodes. [[Vince Gilligan]] was promoted to executive producer and wrote one episode. [[John Shiban]] was promoted to co-executive producer and wrote one episode. David Amann was promoted to producer and wrote one episode. [[Jeffrey Bell]] was promoted to executive story editor and wrote one episode. Greg Walker was promoted to executive story editor and wrote two episodes. [[Steven Maeda]] was promoted to story editor and wrote two episodes. [[Daniel Arkin]], who wrote a freelance episode for the series previously, returned to contribute to the story for one episode.

[[Kim Manners]] was promoted to co-executive producer and directed the most of episodes of the season with seven. Directors who directed multiple episodes for the season included [[Tony Wharmby]] who directed four, [[Rod Hardy]] directed three, and [[Richard Compton]] directed two. [[Peter Markle]], [[Terrence O'Hara]], and Barry K. Thomas each directed one episode. Series creator Chris Carter directed a single episode, while writer Frank Spotnitz made his directorial debut.

During 2000, companies were paying Fox $225,000 for every 30-second spot that would air between acts of ''The X-Files''. Many [[Information technology]] (IT) companies were buying commercials during the show, largely due to the fact that "many ['coders IT geeks'] get their weekly fix of science fiction from this prime-time show."<ref name=deadaliveratings/>

===Reviews===
The show's eighth season received mixed to positive reviews from critics. ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' noted that the first eight seasons of ''The X-Files'' were "good-to-great", and that the eighth season of the show was "revitalized by the new 'search for Mulder' story-arc."<ref>{{cite web|author=Adams, Sam; Dyess-Nugent, Phil; Handlen, Zack; Harris, Will; Heller, Jason; Hyden, Steven; Keller, Joel; McGee, Ryan; Modell, Josh; Phipps, Keith; Rabin, Nathan; Semley, John; Teti, John; VanDerWerff, Todd; [[Claire Zulkey|Zulkey, Claire]]|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/one-bad-apple-we-can-live-with-that-31-rotten-part,73536/2/|title=One bad apple...we can live with that: 31 rotten parts of otherwise fantastic wholes|work=[[The A.V.
