The '''United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management''' (also known as the '''McClellan Committee''') was a [[Select or special committee (United States Congress)|select committee]] created by the [[United States Senate]] on January 30, 1957,<ref name="Hilty">Hilty, James.

The select committee's work led directly to the enactment of the [[Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act]] (Public Law 86-257, also known as the Landrum-Griffin Act) on September 14, 1959.<ref name="Senate" /><ref name="Witwer">Witwer, David Scott.

==Background and creation==
In December 1952, [[Robert F. Kennedy]] was appointed assistant counsel for the Government Operations by the then-chairman of the Committee on Government Operations, Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]].<ref name="Schlesinger">Schlesinger, Arthur M., Jr. ''Robert Kennedy and His Times.''

Lexington, Ky.: University Press of Kentucky, 1990. ISBN 081311683X</ref> Kennedy resigned in July 1953,<ref>Robert Kennedy's resignation was prompted by concerns over the McCarthy committee's procedures, which he felt did not sufficiently protect the rights of witnesses and skirted both federal law and legal ethics.

A small percentage of each committee's budget and staff are devoted to the institutional needs of the committee.  The staff employed in this capacity are known as "committee staff," and are nonpartisan career employees. Under the rules established by the majority party in each chamber, the remaining budget and staff are allocated to the majority and largest minority party, respectively.  These staff are known as "majority staff" and "minority staff," although many commentators refer to all committee staff as "committee staff" (leading to some confusion). The tradition of "firm party control" in the House of Representatives usually means that the majority party will control as much as 80 percent of a committee's staff and budget, while the minority party and nonpartisan committee staff control 10 percent each.  In the Senate, the tradition of comity and unanimous consent has led to distribution of staff and budgetary resources on a basis closer to each party's representation in that chamber. There is wide variety in the titles and functions of committee, majority, and minority staff.  As Chief Minority Counsel, Kennedy led a small legal staff employed to provide legal and strategic advice the minority party on the committee. See: Congressional Management Foundation.

[[Image:John l mcclellan.jpg|thumb|left|Senator John L. McClellan (D-Ark.), chair of the Select Committee.]]
Much of the Permanent Subcommittee's work focused on a scandal which emerged in 1956 in the powerful [[trade union]], the [[Teamsters|International Brotherhood of Teamsters]].  In the mid-1950s, [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] Teamster leader [[Jimmy Hoffa]] began an effort to unseat [[Dave Beck]], the union's international president. In October 1955, mobster [[Johnny Dio]] met with Hoffa in [[New York City]] and the two men conspired to create as many as 15 [[paper local]]s (fake [[local union]]s which existed only on paper) to boost Hoffa's delegate totals.<ref>"No Ordinary Hoodlum," ''New York Times,'' August 30, 1956.</ref><ref name="TopBeckAide">Loftus, Joseph A.

The charter is similar to a constitution, and establishes the membership requirements, work and/or geographical jurisdiction, and structure of the new local union. Early in American history, a parent union would issue a charter, and organize workers into the new union. Since the mid-20th century, more frequently unions have organized workers first and then issued a charter. See: Doherty, Robert Emmett. ''Industrial and Labor Relations Terms: A Glossary.'' 5th ed.

To solve its jurisdictional and political problems, the Senate established on January 30, 1957, an entirely new committee, the Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management, and gave it broad subpeona and investigative powers.<ref>"New Senate Unit to Widen Inquiry In Labor Rackets."

==Investigations==
The Select Committee focused its attention for most of 1957 on the Teamsters union. Teamsters President Dave Beck fled the country for a month to avoid its subpoenas before returning in March 1957.<ref>"Beck Visiting in the Bahamas." ''New York Times.''

As the Hoffa hearings occurred in August 1957, the Select Committee met in executive session to restructure its organizations and set its agenda for the future.<ref name="Witwer" /> The Select Committee had succeeded in securing the removal of Dave Beck as Teamsters president and seemed on the verge of sending Jimmy Hoffa to jail as well, but the Committee had also been strongly criticized for its handling of witnesses and its apparent one-sidedness in exposing union but not management corruption.<ref name="Lee" /><ref>Fones-Wolf, Elizabeth.

''The National Labor Relations Board.'' Santa Barbara, Calif.: Praeger Publishers, 1974; Finkelman, Paul. ''Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties.'' New York: CRC Press, 2006. ISBN 0415943426</ref> To guide the Select Committee's investigations in the future, McClellan established a set of 11 areas of investigation for the committee, nine of which involved labor misdeeds and only one of which involved management misbehavior (preventing workers from organizing unions).<ref name="Witwer" /> The management-oriented area came last on the committee's list of priorities, and there were no staff assigned to investigate the issue.<ref>Only one set of hearings were ever held on the topic of management misdeeds, in mid-fall 1957. See: Witwer, ''Corruption and Reform in the Teamsters Union,'' 2003.</ref>

Under the new guidelines, the Select Committee's schedule of hearings slowed. In January 1958, Chairman McClellan asked for and received permission from the Senate to extend the deadline for completing the committee's work for another year.<ref name="Charge" /> For a short time early in the year, the Select Committee investigated the [[International Union of Operating Engineers]], and uncovered a limited financial scandal at the top of the union.<ref>Loftus, Joseph A. "Union Head Cited on Expense Funds." ''New York Times.'' January 31, 1958; Raskin, A.H. "A.F.L.-C.I.O. Starts Engineer Inquiry." ''New York Times.'' February 5, 1958.</ref> But the main focus of the committee for the first half of the year was the United Auto Workers.  Republicans on the Select Committee, notably Barry Goldwater, had for several months in late 1957 accused Robert Kennedy of covering up extensive corruption in the UAW.<ref name="Hilty" /><ref name="Schlesinger" /><ref name="Lee" /><ref name="Savage" /> The Republicans pointed to a lengthy, ongoing, and sometimes violent strike which the UAW was conducting against the [[Kohler Company|Kohler]] plumbing fixtures company in Wisconsin.<ref name="Hilty" /><ref name="Schlesinger" /><ref name="Lee" /><ref name="Savage" /> [[Walter Reuther]], President of the Auto Workers, told Select Committee investigators that the Kohler Company was committing numerous [[unfair labor practice]]s against the union and that the union's books were in order.<ref name="Lee" /> Despite no evidence of any mismanagement or organized crime infiltration, Kennedy and McClellan went ahead with hearings on the UAW in February 1958. The five-week series of hearings produced no evidence of corruption.<ref name="Lee" /><ref>Baltakis, Anthony.

''United Press International.'' April 2, 1958.</ref>  A second set of hearings into the UAW in September 1959 lasted just six days, and once more uncovered no evidence of UAW malfeasance.<ref name="Hilty" /><ref>"Inquiry on U.A.W. Opened to Public." ''Associated Press.'' August 19, 1959; "M'Clellan Group Ends U.A.W. Study." ''United Press International.'' September 10, 1959.</ref> The September 1959 hearings were the last public hearings the embarrassed committee ever held.<ref name="Lee" />

As the UAW hearings were winding down, the Select Committee issued its first Interim Report on March 24, 1958. The report roundly condemned Jimmy Hoffa (by now President of the Teamsters) and accused the Teamsters of gathering enough power to destroy the national economy.<ref name="OBrien" /> Refocusing its attention back on the Teamsters, the Select Committee held a short set of hearings in August 1958 intended to expose corruption by the Hoffa regime.  But a number of witnesses recanted their written testimony and the hearings led nowhere.<ref>The Select Committee would seek to prosecute 13 witnesses for contempt of Congress because of the recantments. See: Loftus, Joseph A. "Senators Balked in Effor to Link Hoffa to Pay-Off." ''New York Times.'' August 6, 1958; Drury, Allen. "Rackets Unit Asks Prosecution for 13." ''New York Times.'' August 9, 1958.</ref>

In February 1959, the Select Committee's attention turned to an investigation of organized crime.<ref name="Hilty" /><ref name="Witwer" /><ref>Drury, Allen. "M'Clellan Calls Mobs Peril to U.S." ''New York Times.'' February 26, 1959.</ref> McClellan had won yet another one-year extension of the Select Committee's existence in January, giving it additional time for more investigations.<ref name="PartyRatio" /> This new focus was a natural outgrowth of the committee's previous investigations, but it also reflected the committee's frustration at uncovering no additional scandals like the one which had rocked the Teamsters. Through much of the spring and summer of 1959, the committee held a series of public hearings which brought a number of organized crime figures to the public's attention, including [[Anthony Corrallo]], [[Vito Genovese]], [[Anthony Provenzano]], [[Joey Glimco]], [[Sam Giancana]], and [[Carlos Marcello]].<ref name="Hilty" /> Although more muted and less frequent, criticisms of the Select Committee and Robert Kennedy continued. Kennedy's moralism about labor racketeering, several high-profile critics concluded, even endangered the Constitution.<ref>A noted attorney, speaking before the New York Bar Association, concluded that the Select Committee purposefully asked witnesses about issues it knew they could not answer without incriminating themselves. This led witnesses to rely on their Fifth Amendment rights repeatedly, and the Select Committee utilized this reliance to imply that the witnesses were guilty. This undercut the public's support for the Fifth Amendment, and endangered the right. See: Weaver, Jr., Warren. "Fifth Amendment Declared Abused." ''New York Times.'' June 27, 1959.</ref> Although McClellan wanted to further investigate organized crime, the Select Committee had reached the limits of its jurisdiction and no further investigations were made.

By September 1959, it was clear that the Select Committee was not developing additional information to justify continued operation.<ref>"M'Clellan Group Ends U.A.W. Study." ''United Press International.'' September 10, 1959.</ref>  A second interim report was released in August 1959 once again denouncing the Teamsters and Jimmy Hoffa.<ref> Loftus, Joseph A. "Hoffa Denounced in Senate Report for Union Abuses." ''New York Times.'' August 5, 1959.</ref> Robert F. Kennedy resigned as the Select Committee's chief counsel on September 11, 1959, and joined Senator John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign as campaign manager.<ref name="Schlesinger" /><ref>"Kennedy Quits as Inquiry Aide." ''New York Times.'' September 11, 1959.</ref>  Committee members became more involved in passing legislation to deal with the abuses uncovered.

==Disbandment and legislative and other outcomes==
The final report of the Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management was issued on March 31, 1960. At that time, the authority granted by the Senate to the Select Committee was transferred to the Committee on Government Operations.<ref name="Senate" /><ref>"Report Declares Hoffa Pretender." ''New York Times.'' March 29, 1960; Loftus, Joseph A. "Vending Devices Linked to Racket." ''New York Times.'' April 1, 1960.</ref>

During its existence, the Select Committee conducted 253 active investigations, served 8,000 subpoenas for witnesses and documents, held 270 days of hearings with 1,526 witnesses (343 of whom invoked the Fifth Amendment), compiled almost 150,000 pages of testimony, and issued two interim and one final report.<ref name="Hilty" /><ref name="Senate" /> At its peak, 104 persons were engaged in the work of the committee,<ref name="Hilty" /> including 34 field investigators.<ref name="Hilty" /><ref name="Senate" /> Another 58 staffers were delegated to the committee by the Government Accounting Office and worked in [[Detroit]], [[Chicago]], New York City, and southern [[Florida]].<ref name="Hilty" /><ref name="Senate" /> To accommodate the huge staff, a corridor was blocked off in the [[Russell Senate Office Building|Old Senate Office Building]] and turned into a suite of offices.<ref name="Hilty" />

Some observers continued to criticize the Select Committee. In 1961, [[Yale University]] law professor [[Alexander Bickel]] accused Kennedy of being punitive and battering witnesses, compared his tactics to those of Joseph McCarthy, and declared Kennedy unfit to be Attorney General.<ref>Bickel, Alexander M. "Robert F. Kennedy: The Case Against Him for Attorney General." ''The New Republic.'' January 9, 1961.</ref> At the turn of the century, historians and biographers continued to criticize the Select Committee's lack of respect for the constitutional rights of witnesses brought before it.<ref name="Hilty" /><ref name="Goldfarb" /><ref name="Mills" /><ref name="Newfield" />

===Legislative and legal outcomes===
Several historic legal developments came out of the select committee's investigation, including a [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision and landmark labor legislation. The right of union officials to exercise their Fifth Amendment rights was upheld and a significant refinement of constitutional law made when the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed the right of union officials to not divulge the location of union records in ''[[Curcio v. United States]],'' [[case citation|354 U.S. 118]] (1957).<ref>"Teamster Wins Contempt Test." ''New York Times.'' June 11, 1957; Goldstein, Howard W. ''Grand Jury Practice.''

The scandals uncovered by the Select Committee led directly to passage of the [[Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act]] (also known as the Landrum-Griffin Act) in 1959. Calls for legislation and drafts of bills began circulating in the Senate as early as May 1957.<ref name="Jacobs">Jacobs, James B.

"Conquering the Enemy Within: The Case for Reform of the Landrum-Griffin Act." ''Journal of Labor Research.'' 26:1 (December 2005).</ref> Among the more prominent bills was one submitted in 1958 by Senators John F. Kennedy and Irving Ives (with assistance from nationally-known [[Labour law|labor law]] professor [[Archibald Cox]]) which covered 30 areas, including union recordkeeping, finances, and democratic organizational structures and rules.<ref name="OBrien" /> The Kennedy-Ives bill proved immensely controversial, leading to the longest Senate debate of the year, and the greatest number of amendments and floor votes any piece of legislation that year.<ref name="OBrien" /> But President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] opposed the bill and it died when the Congressional session ended in December 1958.  Kennedy reintroduced the bill, with some additional provisions, in 1959. Although Ives had retired from the Senate, Senator Sam Ervin agreed to co-sponsor the revised bill.<ref name="OBrien" /> The Kennedy-Ervin bill also encountered stiff opposition, and Republicans were able to win Senate approval of a management "bill of rights" to the bill which labor strongly denounced.<ref>Loftus, Joseph A. "Kennedy Suffers Setback As Labor Bill Is Amended." ''New York Times.'' April 23, 1959.</ref> But with this and other Republican-backed amendments, the bill passed the Senate overwhelmingly.<ref name="OBrien" />

By 1959 the Eisenhower administration had crafted its own bill, which was co-sponsored in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by [[Phillip M. Landrum]] (Democrat from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]) and [[Robert P. Griffin]] (Republican from [[Michigan]]). The Landrum-Griffin bill contained much stricter financial reporting and fiduciary restrictions than the Kennedy-Ervin bill as well as several unrelated provisions restricting union organizing, picketing, and boycott activity.<ref>For example, the Landrum-Griffin bill also barred members of the Communist Party and convicted felons from holding union office, prohibited [[secondary boycott]]s, prohibited collective bargaining agreement allowing union members to refuse to handle cargo which had been handled by [[strikebreaker]]s, and restricted picketing to obtain recognition of the union.

''New York Times.'' August 18, 1959.</ref> On September 3 and 4, the House and Senate passed the conference committee bill, which was far closer to the original Landrum-Griffin bill than the Kennedy-Ervin bill, and President Eisenhower signed the bill into law on September 14, 1959.<ref name="OBrien" /><ref>Loftus, Joseph A. "New Labor Bill With Wide Curbs Set for Passage." ''New York Times.'' September 3, 1959.</ref>

After the Select Committee's mandate expired, Senator McClellan and others advocated that the Senate expand the jurisdiction of one or more committees not only to provide oversight of the new labor law but also to continue the Senate's investigations into organized crime. McClellan originally sought jurisdiction for his own Committee on Government Operations, but members of his committee balked at the request.<ref>Loftus, Joseph A. "Watchdog Urged in Labor Reform."

March 25, 1960.</ref> However, McClellan was able to convince the full Senate to impose jurisdiction on Government Operations, and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations began making inquiries into matters pertaining to syndicated or organized crime.<ref>"Senate Rules Committee Backs Extension of Rackets Inquiry."

The hearings had positive benefits for other key participants as well.  The Kennedy-Ives bill was Senator John F.

McClellan devoted significant time and resources of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (of which he was chair) to pushing anti-organized crime agenda in 1960s, and his efforts kept the issue alive despite the prominence of other issues such as the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|civil rights movement]] and [[Vietnam War]].<ref name="Reppetto" /><ref name="Kelly" /><ref name="Arkansas">Williams, Nancy A. and Whayne, Jeannie M.
