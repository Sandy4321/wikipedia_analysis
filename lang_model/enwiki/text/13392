'''Ashlee Nicole Simpson''' (born [[October 3]], [[1984]]) is an [[United States|America]]n [[pop rock]] [[singer]]&ndash;[[songwriter]] and [[actor|actress]], and sister of pop singer [[Jessica Simpson]]. 
Simpson rose to prominence in mid-2004 through the success of her number-one [[debut album]] ''[[Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album)|Autobiography]]'' and the accompanying [[reality television|reality series]] ''[[The Ashlee Simpson Show]]''. Simpson received widespread criticism when she used a pre-recorded vocal track for a performance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in [[October 2004]]. Following a North American [[concert tour]] and a film appearance, Simpson released a second number-one album, ''[[I Am Me]]'', in late [[2005]]. 

==Biography==
===Early life===
Simpson was born in [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], [[Texas]],<ref name="TXBI" /> and raised in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]. She is the daughter of [[Joe Simpson (manager)|Joe Truett Simpson]] (a former [[Baptist]] youth minister who is now her [[manager]]) and Tina Ann Drew (a former Sunday School teacher who [[Homeschooling|homeschooled]] Ashlee).{{Fact|date=February 2007}} An accomplished dancer, Simpson began studying classical [[ballet]] at the age of three, and was admitted to the [[School of American Ballet]] in [[New York City]] at the age of eleven.<ref>Although the minimum age for admission was technically 12, Joe Simpson said that he lied about his daughter's age to get her into the school in an October 2004 interview. (Jeff Leeds, ''[[The New York Times]]'', [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60C12FA3F5C0C708CDDA90994DC404482 "Who Wants to Be a New Simpson?"], Section 2, Page 1, [[October 3]] [[2004]].)</ref> Around that time, she suffered from an eating disorder; the condition lasted about six months, and she dropped to about 31 kg (70 pounds) at 159&nbsp;cm (5ft 2in), but her parents then stepped in and got her to eat more.<ref>Stephen M.

Later, she began appearing in films and television series, including an episode of the sitcom ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'' in 2001, a minor role in the 2002 [[film]] ''[[The Hot Chick]]'' and a recurring role on the family drama series ''[[7th Heaven]]''. In the summer of 2003, recorded a song titled "Just Let Me Cry" for the [[soundtrack]] of the film ''[[Freaky Friday (2003 film)|Freaky Friday]]''. Eventually, Simpson signed a record deal with [[Geffen Records]].

===Debut album and reality television===
Ashlee Simpson's first album, ''Autobiography'', debuted at number one in the U.S. in [[July 2004]] with first week sales numbering around 398,000 copies. The album was certified triple [[platinum album|platinum]] in September 2004. Simpson co-wrote all of the album's tracks and described it as "very true to my emotion"<ref>[[September 15]] [[2004]] [[Capital FM]] ([[London]]) radio interview.</ref> in one interview, but critical reviews were mixed.<ref>{{cite web | title=Metacritic Autobiography review collection | url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/simpsonashlee/autobiography | accessmonthday=September 7 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's Peter Relic characterised ''Autobiography'' as a "mundane melange of [[Avril Lavigne|Avril]]-ish brat pop and [[Sheryl Crow]] cod rock".<ref>{{cite web | title=Rolling Stone review of Autobiography | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/_/id/6222372/ashleesimpson?rnd=1123894912500&has-player=true&version=6.0.12.1040 | accessmonthday=August 27 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> [[E!

Simpson occasionally appeared on ''[[Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica]]'', a reality show about the married life of Jessica and her then-husband [[Nick Lachey]]. To accompany the beginning of her own music career, she got her own MTV reality show entitled ''[[The Ashlee Simpson Show]]'', which aired in a subsequent time slot to ''Newlyweds''. It ran in the U.S. for eight weekly episodes over the summer of [[2004]], and a second season of ten episodes aired from January-[[March 2005]]. The show dealt with the process of writing, recording, and performing Simpson's music as well as aspects of her personal life.

When appearing for live performances, Simpson performs live with a backing band consisting of Ray Brady (guitar), Braxton Olita (guitar), Joey Kaimana (bass guitar&mdash;from [[2004]]-[[2005]] Zach Kennedy filled this role), Chris Megert (keyboards and vocals&mdash;from late 2004-2005 Lucy Walsh filled this role), and Chris Fox (drums).

In addition to her own first album, Simpson sang "Christmas Past, Present, and Future" on the 2004 holiday album ''[[Radio Disney Jingle Jams]]'' and a [[duet (music)|duet]] of the [[Christmas song]] "[[Little Drummer Boy]]" with her sister Jessica for the album ''[[Rejoyce: The Christmas Album|Rejoyce]]'', which they had sung together during the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[variety show|variety hour]] special "Nick & Jessica's Family Christmas".<ref>{{cite web | title=Press (and awards) from Ashlee's official website | url=http://ashleesimpsonmusic.com/about/features.asp?page=all | accessmonthday=September 7 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=ABC's Nick & Jessica's Family Christmas | url=http://abc.go.com/specials/nickjess_xmas.html | accessmonthday=August 27 |accessyear=2005 }}</ref> In 2004 Simpson received the "Song of the Summer" [[Teen Choice Award]] for "Pieces of Me," as well as the "Fresh Face" award. In addition, she also won a [[Billboard Music Award|Billboard Award]] for New Female Artist of the Year in December,<ref>Charlie Amter, [http://web.archive.org/web/20060110005559/http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,15489,00.html ""Billboard" Awards Usher in Victory"], ''E! Online News'', December 9, 2004.</ref> and was later named [[Entertainment Weekly|''Entertainment Weekly'']]'s "Breakout Star of 2004" in January 2005. Simpson also co-hosted ''[[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin Eve]]'' along with [[Regis Philbin]] (in [[Dick Clark (entertainer)|Dick Clark]]'s absence) at the end of the year, hosting the West Coast portion of the show and performing three songs.

===The ''Saturday Night Live'' incident===
[[Image:Cryingafterlipsync.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Simpson crying due to vocal difficulties after a rehearsal for her controversial ''Saturday Night Live'' appearance in 2004.]]
Simpson appeared as a musical guest on Episode 568 of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' ([[October 23]]&ndash;[[October 24|24]], [[2004]]), and as is customary for the show's format, she was scheduled to perform two songs. Her first song, "Pieces of Me", was performed without problems. However, when she began her second song, "Autobiography", the vocals for the song "Pieces of Me" were heard again&mdash;before she had raised the microphone to her mouth. Simpson began to dance spasmodically and then left the stage, while the band (not a recording) continued playing. During the closing of the show Simpson appeared with the guest host [[Jude Law]] stating that her band performed the wrong song in the opening on the performance and commenting that she thought she'd "do a [[hoedown]]" following the musical number. Others, however, criticized her for what they saw as evidence that she was [[lip sync]]hing.

On [[October 25]], Simpson called in to the [[music video]] show ''[[Total Request Live]]'' and explained that due to complications arising from a "severe" variation of [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease|acid reflux]] (which had previously been seen in ''[[The Ashlee Simpson Show]]'') she had completely lost her voice and her doctor had advised her not to sing. She claimed that because of the acid reflux, her father required her to use a [[guide track]] for the performance. She said of the incident, "I made a complete fool of myself." According to Simpson, the drummer hit the wrong button, which caused the wrong track to be played.<ref>{{cite news | last=Vineyard | first=Jennifer | title=Ashlee Blames Gastric Distress For 'SNL' Lip-Synch Snafu | date= [[25 October]] [[2004]] | publisher=MTV News|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1492993/10252004/simpson_ashlee.jhtml}}</ref> During the [[October 25]] [[Radio Music Awards]] broadcast, Simpson pretended, as a joke, to make the same mistake as she did in the ''SNL'' incident, but then began to perform "Autobiography" without using a pre-recorded vocal track as she had done during the prior ''SNL'' performance.  On [[October 31]], the [[CBS]] news program ''[[60 Minutes]]'' aired footage from Simpson's rehearsals before the ''SNL'' performance in which Simpson is shown to be disturbed by voice trouble.

===Early 2005===
On [[January 4]], [[2005]], Simpson performed "La La" at the halftime show for the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]]; after her performance, many of the 72,000-plus spectators [[booing|booed]]. Representatives for the Orange Bowl stated that they were pleased with her performance and felt that it was a belated reaction to the ''SNL'' incident, while others have speculated that it may have been because the audience of the Orange Bowl was outside of Simpson's target age bracket. Still others disagree, however ([[Kelly Clarkson]] had performed before Simpson in the show to a far more positive reaction), and assert that her performance was poor and very off-key.<ref name="daddydearest">{{cite news | last=Graham | first=Ren<U+00E9>e | title=Ashlee Simpson's career comes courtesy of Daddy dearest | date=[[11 January]] [[2005]] | publisher=Boston Globe | url=http://www.boston.com/ae/celebrity/articles/2005/01/11/ashlee_simpsons_career_comes_courtesy_of_daddy_dearest/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Pulskamp | first=Andrew | title=Ashlee Simpson's Halftime Performance Falls Flat|date=[[5 January]] [[2005]] | publisher=Local10.com | url=http://www.local10.com/entertainment/4048912/detail.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=MTV - Orange Bowl halftime show story | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1495731/20050111/index.jhtml?headlines=true | accessmonthday=August 27 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Audio of Orange Bowl performance (MP3) | url=http://graphics.boston.com/audio/ae/ashlee_simpson_orange_bowl.mp3 | accessmonthday=September 7 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref>

Following her Orange Bowl performance, an [[Internet petition]] at PetitionOnline.com complaining about Simpson's singing was among the most active of the site's petitions.<ref>{{cite web | title=Yahoo News - Online petition story | url=http://launch.yahoo.com/read/news/14285421 | accessmonthday=August 27 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> Simpson later said: "That's cool.

Simpson's first U.S. headlining tour (with two dates in [[Canada]] as well) ran from mid-February-late [[April 2005]], and its opening acts were [[Pepper's Ghost (band)|Pepper's Ghost]] and [[The Click Five]].<ref>{{cite news | last=Moss | first=Corey | title=Ashlee Simpson Soldiers On, Like Always, Through Tour-Launch Snafus | date=[[17 February]] [[2005]] | publisher=MTV | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1497210/20050217/simpson_ashlee.jhtml?headlines=true}}</ref> In addition to material from ''Autobiography'', Simpson performed her own unreleased song "Hollywood", [[The Pretenders]]' "[[Brass in Pocket]]", [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s "[[Call Me (Blondie song)|Call Me]]", and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Burning Up]]". She said that the tour would be "stripped down", without [[pyrotechnics]], and that "it's going to be me and my band getting out there and having fun".<ref>{{cite news | last=Bird | first=Rick | title=Ashlee Simpson at the Taft | date=[[8 March]] [[2005]] | publisher=Cincinnati Post | url=http://www.cincypost.com/2005/03/08/ashlee030805.html}}</ref> In [[March 2005]], Simpson said that ''The Ashlee Simpson Show'' would conclude at the end of its second season,<ref name="MTVGoing80s">{{cite news | last=Vineyard | first=Jennifer | title=Ashlee Simpson Going '80s, Getting Personal On Next Album|date=[[25 March]] [[2005]] | publisher=MTV | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1499052/20050325/simpson_ashlee.jhtml?headlines=true}}</ref> the last episode of which aired at the end of the month.

===Film, second album, and theater===
Simpson had a supporting role as an aspiring actress named Clea in ''[[Undiscovered]]'' (originally titled ''Wannabe''), an [[independent film]] that was released in theaters in [[August 2005]]. Simpson filmed her scenes in late [[2004]]. While Simpson's performance was met with acceptable reviews,<ref>{{cite news | last=Rechtshaffen | first=Michael | title=Michael Rechtshaffen's review of Undiscovered | date=26 August 2005 | publisher=Hollywood Reporter | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001021909}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Elder | first=Robert K. | title=Robert K.

Simpson's second album, ''[[I Am Me]]'', was released in the U.S. on [[October 18]], [[2005]]. Simpson said that she had wanted to incorporate the feel of music from the 1980s on the album, and that unlike her debut it would focus less on relationships and more on herself.<ref name="MTVGoing80s"/> ''I Am Me'' debuted at number one with roughly 220,000 copies sold,<ref>{{cite web | title=It's All About Ashlee: Simpson Scores Another #1 With ''I Am Me'' | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1512238/10262005/simpson_ashlee.jhtml?headlines=true|accessmonthday=October 26 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> but sales quickly deteriorated; by April 2006, it had sold a little less than 900,000 copies.<ref>Jonathan Cohen, [http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002385824 "Ashlee Simpson Hitting The Road This Summer"], Billboard.com, April 25, 2006.</ref> Its first single, "[[Boyfriend (song)|Boyfriend]]", became a top twenty hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and performed similarly elsewhere. The second single, "[[L.O.V.E.]]", reached the U.S. top twenty-five, its success aided by a remix by R&B/hip-hop producer [[Missy Elliott]] and [[MTV]]'s heavy rotation of the single's [[music video]] (it has been her most successful video to date on ''[[Total Request Live]]'').

Simpson began a concert tour in late September in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] and appeared on the [[October 8]], [[2005]] episode of ''SNL'' to promote the album. The first of Simpson's two performances on the show was of the ballad "Catch Me When I Fall", which was written about her previous ''SNL'' experience, and she thanked the crowd after her second performance. In mid-December, Simpson collapsed after performing in [[Japan]], possibly due to exhaustion. She was briefly hospitalized, and consequently cancelled an appearance at the [[Radio Music Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1518506/20051219/story.jhtml|title=Ashlee Simpson's Collapse Due To Exhaustion|first=Jennifer|last=Vineyard|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=[[2005-12-19]]|accessdate=2006-04-02}}</ref>

===Third album===
In [[November 2006]], Simpson said that she was going to meet with record executives soon and begin working on her third album. Simpson also stated that she would like to work with [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] from [[The Cure]], who attended her last performance as Roxie Hart in the musical "Chicago".<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/simpson_ashlee/artist.jhtml#/news/articles/1545866/11152006/jackson_michael.jhtml "For The Record: Quick News On Michael Jackson, Beyonce, Chris Brown, Ashlee, Cure, Clipse, Nicky Hilton & More"], MTV News, November 15, 2006.</ref>

Producer [[Ron Fair]] said in [[December 2006]] that working on Simpson's next album would be "very tricky" because of press scrutiny and "prejudices", but that Geffen would work with her to overcome that, "because she deserves to be heard and she deserves a shot."<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/#/news/articles/1547396/20061206/stefani_gwen.jhtml "or The Record: Quick News On Gwen, Good Charlotte, Christina, Katharine McPhee, Ashlee, Rihanna & More"], MTV News, December 6, 2006.</ref>

On [[January 17]], [[2007]], Simpson sent out a message to her fans, saying "I am starting to write and record a new album which I am so excited about", and "I have a good feeling about 2007, and I can't wait for you guys to hear my new album later on this year". Simpson's third album is expected to be released before 2008.

On [[February 1]], [[2007]], MTV's ''TRL'' spoke about Simpson's new music, saying such top artists as [[Tom Petty]], [[Pharrell Williams]], [[Linda Perry]], [[India Arie]], and [[Will.I.Am]] want to help Simpson with her third album.

On [[March 6]], [[2007]] MTV reported that Simpson's next album would have "a more soulful sound" and could be released in [[October 2007]]. Simpson said she was writing with many different people.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1553956/20070306/carey_mariah.jhtml "For The Record: Quick News On Mariah, Jennifer Hudson, Jay-Z, Ashlee, K-Fed, Lily Allen, Chili Peppers & More"], MTV News, March 6, 2007.</ref>

In an [[April 2007]] issue of US Magazine, Simpson was quoted to say her album will have a more "mature" sound, yet still remain "rock."

==Image and personal life==
When she first broke onto the scene, Simpson had a decidedly different image from that of her sister. Previously [[blonde]] like Jessica, she dyed her hair dark during the recording of the MTV reality show after she finished filming for the ''7th Heaven'' television series, although after a year with dark hair she returned to blonde in [[2005]]. Simpson's songs also have rock elements absent from her sister's music, and, particularly during the time of her initial stardom, Simpson would often wear shirts with the type of designs that are described as "[[punk fashion|punk]]"-style, sometimes emblazoned with band names. Her fingernails and toenails are often painted black, and has at least three [[tattoos]]: a star on one wrist, two cherries on her ankle, and the word "love" on her other wrist.<ref>{{cite web | title=MTV interview | url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/s/simpson_ashlee/news_feature_050328/ | accessmonthday=August 27 | accessyear=2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Ashlee Simpson Celebrates Her New Album With A Tattoo - Softpedia | url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Ashlee-Simpson-Celebrates-Her-New-Album-With-A-Tattoo-7307.shtml | accessmonthday=September 4 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> Simpson has changed her style significantly over time; she now is often seen favoring girlier, "preppier" looks, though her more "punk"-oriented look is still displayed at concerts. She has also been seen sporting long blond hair extensions.

Her vocals, while generally not thought to equal her sister's range, have been praised by some as fitting the style of her music, and are usually described as "raspy" or "throaty." Simpson and her sister were tied for third on oft-quoted celebrity-fashion critic [[Mr. Blackwell]]'s list of the worst-dressed celebrities of [[2004]]. Blackwell wrote that "from gaudy to grim to downright frenetic these two prove that bad taste is positively genetic."

She has refused to discuss her sex life, in contrast with her sister, who openly stated her intention to practice [[sexual abstinence]] until [[marriage]]. "I decided that I didn't want to talk about that because it's super personal," Simpson said of the situation.<ref>Patty Adams, "The Sister Who Rocks", ''[[YM (magazine)|YM]]'', [[September 2004]], pages 112&ndash;117.</ref> Simpson's relationship with actor [[Josh Henderson]] lasted for nearly two years and ended during the first episode of ''The Ashlee Simpson Show''. Soon after, she began dating fellow musician [[Ryan Cabrera]]. That relationship was also featured on the show, and Simpson appeared as Cabrera's love interest in the [[music video]] for his song "On the Way Down." The two were reported to have split in August 2004 due to their hectic schedules, but they resumed their relationship for a while afterward, before ending it again in early [[2005]]; Simpson says they are still friends, although rumors suggested that Ashlee did not like the fact that Ryan had moved on to [[Lisa Origliasso]] of [[The Veronicas]].

In [[2005]], rumors began circulating that Simpson had stolen [[Wilmer Valderrama]] from [[Lindsay Lohan]]. Simpson's single "Boyfriend" was reported to be about the situation, but she said that the song "is about [how] every girl out there sometimes thinks you stole her boyfriend. It's just making fun of that."<ref>{{cite news | last=Moss | first=Corey | title=Ashlee Says New Single Isn't Directed At Lindsay Lohan | date=[[15 August]] [[2005]] | publisher=MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1507602/08152005/simpson_ashlee.jhtml?headlines=true}}</ref> Valderrama has since said on [[Howard Stern]]'s radio program that he did have sex with Ashlee Simpson, but claimed the incident was unrelated to his break-up with Lohan. Later that year, rumours arose that Simpson was secretly dating another Joe Simpson-managed actor, ''[[Viva La Bam]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Chris Raab]]. In February 2006, she told ''[[Seventeen (magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine that she was dating bandmate Braxton Olita and went on a 10-day vacation with him to Hawaii.<ref name="MTVteen">{{cite web | title=Ashlee Simpson Explains 'Tipsy' Behavior, Reveals New Boyfriend | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1523128/20060203/simpson_ashlee.jhtml?headlines=true | accessmonthday=February 3 |accessyear=2006 }}</ref> 

In [[November 2005]], [[eTalk Daily]] broadcast a video of a late-night visit made by Simpson to a [[McDonald's]] fast-food restaurant in Toronto, Canada. Simpson appeared to be intoxicated in the video, and was shown arguing with a member of the staff, as well as rejecting a customer's attempt to get an autograph from her because he wouldn't kiss her feet. According to Simpson in a 2006 ''[[ELLE]]'' interview, she was "a little [[tipsy]]", and the customer had first called her "gross" before he had realized who she was, at which point he asked her for an autograph.<ref name="MTVteen"/> She has said that she told herself to "grow up" after the incident.

In [[February 2006]], Simpson was honored by MTV's ''[[Total Request Live]]'' (''TRL''), as the "Bounce-Back" artist. The award was given to her for being able to recover from her many ups and downs of her career, and still manage to release another #1 platinum album.

Simpson reportedly had a [[rhinoplasty|nose job]] in [[April 2006]]. When asked about it in an interview in May, Simpson neither confirmed nor denied it.<ref>[http://www.accesshollywood.com/news/ah225.shtml "Ashlee Simpson Coy On Rumors Of New Nose"], Associated Press (Access Hollywood), May 10, 2006.</ref> In the May 2007 issue of ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', she said that she was not insecure about her appearance and had not been beforehand. She that plastic surgery was a "personal choice" that one should only decide to do for oneself and not for others.<ref>Jenny Hontz, ''Harper's Bazaar'', May 2007.</ref> There have also been claims that Simpson had chosen to surgically enhance her lips and to reduce her chin.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}  In June 2006, it was reported that Simpson seriously considered<ref>[http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/ashlee%20simpson%20to%20pose%20for%20playboy_1000966 "Ashlee Simpson to Pose for Playboy?"], Contactmusic.com, June 27, 2006.</ref> but later turned down a $4 million offer to pose nude for Playboy.<ref>[http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/simpson%20snubs%20chance%20to%20pose%20for%20playboy_1000983 "Simpson Snubs Chance to Pose for Playboy"], Contactmusic.com, June 28, 2006.</ref>

In early [[September 2006]], ''Us Weekly'' reported that Simpson and Braxton Olita have split up. Simpson's rep said that the couple <U+201C>broke up about a week ago. They have decided to take a break.<U+201D> Simpson has reportedly been seen with [[Fall Out Boy]] bassist [[Pete Wentz]],<ref> [http://www.usmagazine.com/blog/2006/09/05/ashlee-and-longtime-boyfriend-split/ http://www.usmagazine.com/blog/2006/09/05/ashlee-and-longtime-boyfriend-split/] ''USmagazine.com'' </ref> but later in an interview for ''[[OK!]]'' magazine she denied this.<ref>''OK!'', November 6, 2006.</ref> In an interview with Pete Wentz on Ryan Seacrest's American Top 40 live, Ryan asked if Wentz and Simpson were "on" or "off." Wentz laughed and said "off." 

Simpson was ranked as one of the "Hottest Women in Pop/R&B" by [[Blender (magazine)|''Blender'' magazine]] in January 2007.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=2454&src=cl13 |title=Hottest Women of Pop/R&B |publisher=Blender Magazine Online |date=January 2007 |accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Simpson is sometimes criticized as being a "manufactured" artist with little singing talent.<ref> JENNY ELISCU, Rolling Stone Magazine, [http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ashleesimpson/albums/album/7688283/review/7702860/i_am_me http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ashleesimpson/albums/album/7688283/review/7702860/i_am_me]</ref> Her critics cite incidents like the ''SNL'' episode and the Orange Bowl performance as evidence for their claims.

Even prior to her lip synching incident, Simpson was parodied on a ''[[MadTV]]'' skit. During the skit the actress portraying Simpson made statements such as "Enjoy the commercial... I mean the show!" (referring to ''The Ashlee Simpson Show''), and "The best thing about being a product... I mean an artist!", and goes to a recording session where her vocals have to be mechanically enhanced.

Some allege that Simpson has lip-synched on occasions other than the ''SNL'' episode, comparing the impact of the ''SNL'' incident to the 1990 [[Milli Vanilli]] incident in which their guide track skipped during a live MTV performance, revealing that they were lip-synching.<ref>{{cite news | last=Walls | first=Jeannette | title=Ashlee Simpson just paying lip service to fans|date=[[26 October]] [[2004]] | publisher=MSNBC | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6329101}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Ashlee Simpson criticism from ishkar.com | url=http://www.ishkur.com/editorials/ashleesimpson.php | accessmonthday=September 8 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref><ref name="daddydearest"/> 

In [[January 2006]], Simpson was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzie Award]] for "Worst Supporting Actress" for her role in ''[[Undiscovered]]''; Ashlee's sister Jessica was also nominated in the same category for ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]''. The sisters both lost to [[Paris Hilton]].

In mid-[[2006]], Simpson gave an interview to ''[[Marie Claire]]'' magazine, in which she was said to have "had it with Hollywood's twisted view of feminine beauty" and was photographed painting a pro-female mural with a group of underprivileged girls from Los Angeles's Green Dot Public School. However, by the time the magazine hit newsstands, Simpson had already had her alleged nose job and had been seen sporting long blonde hair extensions. Some ''Marie Claire'' readers complained about this as being hypocritical; the magazine received over 1,000 angry letters and the magazine's new editor expanded the letters section of the September issue of the magazine to give readers a chance to vent their frustrations.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2006/07/31/marie-claire-goes-edgy-and-anti-simpson/ "Marie Claire Goes Edgy and Anti-Simpson"], Rollingstone.com, July 31, 2006.</ref><ref>Jennifer Vineyard, [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1537872/08032006/simpson_ashlee.jhtml "''Marie Claire'' Editor, Readers Lash Out At Ashlee Simpson"], MTV News, August 4, 2006.</ref>
