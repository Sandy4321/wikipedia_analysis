The '''Bulgarian coup d'<U+00E9>tat of 1944''', also known as the '''9 September coup d'<U+00E9>tat''' ({{lang-bg|<U+0414><U+0435><U+0432><U+0435><U+0442><U+043E><U+0441><U+0435><U+043F><U+0442><U+0435><U+043C><U+0432><U+0440><U+0438><U+0439><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438> <U+043F><U+0440><U+0435><U+0432><U+0440><U+0430><U+0442>}}, ''Devetoseptemvriyski prevrat'') and called in [[History of the People's Republic of Bulgaria|pre-1989 Bulgaria]] the '''National Uprising of 9 September''' or the '''Socialist Revolution of 9 September''' was a change in the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]]'s administration and government carried out on the eve of 9 September 1944. The government of [[List of Prime Ministers of Bulgaria|Prime Minister]] [[Konstantin Muraviev]] was overthrown and replaced with a government of the [[Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)|Fatherland Front]] led by [[Kimon Georgiev]]. While the Soviet Union supported the coup, their forces (the [[Soviet Southwestern Front|Third Ukrainian Front]]) were not directly involved in it, as they had only entered northeastern Bulgaria at this point. Following that date, large-scale political, economic and social changes were introduced to the country, with Bulgaria quitting the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] and coming into the [[Soviet sphere of influence]].

==Background==
On 26 August 1944, the government of [[Ivan Bagryanov]] had orally declared Bulgaria's neutrality in the war under the threat of the Red Army's offensive in neighbouring [[Romania]]. At the same time, in [[Egypt]] the government had entered separate peace talks with the United Kingdom and the United States, hoping to secure the dispatch of British and American troops in Bulgaria. On that same day, the Central Committee of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party|Bulgarian Workers' Party]] (BWP) proclaimed the assumption of power by means of a popular uprising to be its official task.

A government of the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]] (BANU) "Vrabcha 1", until then in [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]], was formed on 2 September 1944, headed by Konstantin Muraviev. It continued the peace talks, declared its support for [[democracy|democratic]] reforms and ordered the withdrawal of [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] troops from Bulgaria. At the same time, the [[guerrilla]] actions of the [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] did not cease, the alliance with [[Nazi Germany]] was not disbanded and no attempts were made to normalize the relations with [[Moscow]], forcing the Soviet Union to treat the new government with suspicion. On 5 September 1944, the Soviet Union [[declaration of war|declared war]] on Bulgaria.

On 5 September, the Central Committee of the BWP and the general staff of the Popular Liberation Revolutionary Army commenced the planning of a coup d'<U+00E9>tat . The plan was further detailed on 8 September. According to the plan, the coordinated actions of the partisans, the BWP combat groups and the pro-Fatherland Front army detachments would assume power and effective control of government during the night of 9 September. The stated goal of the coup d'<U+00E9>tat was the "overthrowing of the [[fascism|fascist]] authorities and the establishment of popular-democratic power of the Fatherland Front".

Unrest began all around Bulgaria on 6 September and 7 September, with the strikes of the [[Pernik]] miners and the [[Sofia]] tram employees, as well as the general strikes in [[Plovdiv]] and [[Gabrovo]]. The prisons in [[Pleven]], [[Varna]] and [[Sliven]] had their political prisoners released; 170 localities were entered by partisan detachments between 6 September and 8 September. In many cities and villages, the strikes and meetings grew into armed clashes with the [[police]], with victims on both sides. On 8 September,<ref>History of Bulgaria, Petar Delev et al., 2001, p.364</ref> the Red Army entered Bulgaria meeting with no opposition on the order of the new Bulgarian government.

==The coup d'<U+00E9>tat==
On the eve of 9 September, army units together with Fatherland Front detachments captured key locations in Sofia, such as the Ministry of War, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the [[Bulgarian Posts|post]], the telegraph, the [[Bulgarian National Radio|radio]], the [[Sofia Central Railway Station|railway station]], etc. Early in the morning, the new [[List of Prime Ministers of Bulgaria|Prime Minister]] Kimon Georgiev informed the people on the radio of the shuffle:

{{cquote|With the complete awareness that it is a true and full voice of the popular will, the Fatherland Front assumes in that fateful hour and difficult conditions the government of the country in order to save it from destruction.}}

On 9 September, on the order of the Popular Liberation Revolutionary Army commander-in-chief [[Dobri Terpeshev]], all partisan units descended from the mountains and assumed power in the villages and cities. In most places, this was not met with much resistance, but in other cases army and police detachments loyal to the old government put up violent resistance to the Fatherland Front forces. In Sofia, Plovdiv, the region of Pernik, [[Shumen]] and [[Haskovo]], the old regime's supporters were defeated by military means, with the army coming under the effective control of the Fatherland Front. The establishment of the new leadership happened at the latest in Haskovo, where partisans and other [[antifascism|antifascists]] seized the artillery barracks on 12 September, but suffered many casualties, as the negotiations with the commanding officers failed to reach a compromise.

As of 9 September, the Red Army had not reached Sofia but remained in northeastern Bulgaria. As the Bulgarian [[communism|communists]] were capable of assuming power without any aid, the Red Army commanders decided not to hurry with a seizure of the capital.

==The new government==
The Fatherland Front government included representatives of the BWP, BANU "Pladne", the Bulgarian Workers' Social Democratic Party (Wide Socialists) and [[Zveno]]. The former Prime Minister Konstantin Muraviev was arrested, as were [[List of Bulgarian monarchs|Tsar]] [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Simeon II]]'s regents, members of the former government, and some army detachment heads. On 10 September, the police was abolished and replaced with a popular [[militia]] consisting mainly of recent partisans; 8,130 political prisoners were released from the prisons, and the [[concentration camp]]s of the former regime (e.g. Gonda voda, Krasto pole, Lebane) were closed down. The fascist organizations were banned, as were their publications. The former regents, [[Prince Kyril of Bulgaria|Prince Kyril]], [[Bogdan Filov]], and [[List of Bulgarian generals in the Kingdom of Bulgaria|Nikola Mihailov Mihov]], were executed in February. On 15 September 1946, a [[Bulgarian republic referendum, 1946|referendum]] was held and [[monarchy]] was abolished.

==Aftermath==

After 9 September 1944, the [[Bulgarian Army]] joined the Third Ukrainian Front and contributed to the defeat of Nazism in [[Europe]], helping drive out the Germans from much of [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Hungary]], reaching as far as [[Klagenfurt]] in [[Austria]] by April 1945. Although Bulgaria was not recognized as a true member of the Allies, it still managed to retain [[Southern Dobruja]] which it had acquired in 1940 per the [[Treaty of Craiova]].
