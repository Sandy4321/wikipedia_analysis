{{about|the wife of Harold II|his unwedded consort, also named Ealdgyth or Edith|Edith the Fair}}
'''Ealdgyth''' (''fl. c''. 1057<U+2013>1066), also '''Aldgyth''' or anglicized, '''Edith''', was a daughter of [[<U+00C6>lfgar, Earl of Mercia]], the wife of [[Gruffudd ap Llywelyn]] (d. 1063), ruler of all Wales, and later the wife and queen consort of [[Harold Godwineson]], king of England in 1066.<ref name=ODNB>Maund, "Ealdgyth (''fl. c''.1057<U+2013>1066)"</ref>

==Family==
Ealdgyth was the daughter of [[<U+00C6>lfgar, Earl of Mercia|<U+00C6>lfgar]], who had been earl of East Anglia a number of times in the 1050s and was appointed earl of Mercia in ''c''. 1057, in succession of his father [[Leofric, Earl of Mercia|Earl Leofric]]. <U+00C6>lfgar's wife <U+00C6>lfgifu was probably her mother, and [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Eadwine, the later earl of Mercia]], and [[Morcar]], earl of Northumbria, were her brothers.<ref name=ODNB /> <p>
In 1055, <U+00C6>lfgar was exiled on the charge of treason. He went to Ireland to muster troops and formed an alliance with [[Gruffudd ap Llywelyn]], who had been king of Gwynedd (1039-1055) but assumed the sovereignty of all Wales in 1055. <U+00C6>lfgar and Gruffudd invaded England and plundered Hereford, bringing great humiliation to [[Ralph the Timid|Earl Ralph]], who needed to call in external support to repel the invaders. When peace was made, <U+00C6>lfgar resumed office before succeeding his father as earl of Mercia in ''c''. 1057.<ref name=Aelfgar>Williams, "<U+00C6>lfgar, earl of Mercia (d. 1062?)".</ref>

==Marriages and issue==

It was presumably in the year of her father's appointment (''c''. 1057) that Ealdgyth married his political ally, King Gruffudd ap Llywelyn. [[William of Jumi<U+00E8>ges]] describes her as a woman of considerable beauty.<ref name=ODNB /> [[Walter Map]] also wrote of a beautiful lady much beloved by the king and so he may have had Ealdgyth in mind.<ref name=Walker>Walker, "Gruffudd ap Llywelyn (d. 1063)"</ref> On her marriage, she was given a modest amount of land in England, though the only estate which can be certainly identified as having belonged to her is one at [[Binley, Warwickshire]]. She bore the king a daughter called [[Nest]]. Nest later became the wife of [[Osbern fitz Richard]], a marcher lord on the Herefordshire border, who acquired Binley.<ref name=ODNB /><ref>Edith appears in the [[Domesday Book]] as ''Algid uxor Grifin''. Dictionary of National Biography 1885-1900, Volume 01</ref> Nest and Osbern had a daughter who married [[Bernard de Neufmarch<U+00E9>]], also a marcher lord.<ref name=Walker /> The chronicles also record two of Gruffudd's sons, Maredudd and Ithel, probably for Idwal, who died in 1069, and a third son may be Owain ap Gruffudd (d. 1059).<ref name=Walker />

The alliance between Ealdgyth's father and husband was of great significance in resisting the growing power of the Godwinesons. On the death of Earl Ralph in 1057, Hereford was added to Harold's earldom. The following year, <U+00C6>lfgar was outlawed for a second time, but he was restored to office before long. <U+00C6>lfgar is last heard of in 1062 and seems to have died by 1063, when Harold Godwineson invaded Wales. Gruffudd was killed in the event.<ref name=Aelfgar />

===Harold Godwineson===
:''See also: [[Battle of Hastings]]''

Ealdgyth later became the wife and queen consort of her late husband's enemy Harold. The date of the marriage is unknown, but it must have taken place at some stage before the Conquest, whether before or after Harold's coronation as king of England (January 1066). It seems that Harold's choice of bride was "aimed not only at securing the support of the Mercian house for himself in his royal ambitions, but also at weakening the links between that same house and the rulers of north Wales".<ref name=ODNB /> In any event, Ealdgyth was soon to be widowed for a second time. In October that year, Harold was defeated and died in the [[Battle of Hastings]], which was fought against the invading forces of [[William the Conqueror|William, Duke of Normandy]], who would subsequently ascend the English throne. At the news of Harold's death, Ealdgyth's brothers went to London to fetch her and immediately sent her to [[Chester]] for shelter. It is unknown what happened to her thereafter.<ref name=ODNB /> Harold had a number of children with his common law wife [[Edith the Fair]], but his marriage to Ealdgyth may not have produced any offspring. It has been suggested that Ealdgyth may have been the mother of Harold's son Harold, but this possibility is not universally accepted.<ref name=ODNB /><ref name=Aelfgar /><ref>Fleming, "Harold II (1022/3?<U+2013>1066)"</ref>

==In fiction==
Edith is the main character in the historical romance ''The Wind From Hastings'', which was written by Morgan Llywelyn, and published in 1978.

Eadgyth's story is told in 'Peaceweaver', a novel by Judith Arnopp published in November 2009.
