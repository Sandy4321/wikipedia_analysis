'''''Scooby-Doo''''' is a long-running [[United States|American]] [[animated television series]] produced for [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday morning]] [[television]] by [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] (while the animation studio that was Hanna-Barbera is now [[Cartoon Network Studios]], production of the series is now under [[Warner Bros.]]) in several different versions from 1969 to the present. Though the format of the show and the cast (and ages) of characters have varied significantly over the years, the most familiar versions of the show feature a talking [[Great Dane]] named [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]] and four [[teenager]]s: [[Fred Jones (fictional character)|Fred "Freddie" Jones]], [[Daphne Blake]], [[Velma Dinkley]], and [[Shaggy Rogers|Norville "Shaggy" Rogers]]. 

These five characters (officially referred to collectively as "Mystery, Inc.", but never referred to as such in the original series) drive around the world in a [[van]] called the "Mystery Machine," and solve mysteries typically involving tales of ghosts and other supernatural forces. At the end of each episode, the supernatural forces turn out to have a rational explanation (usually a criminal of some sort trying to scare people away so that they can commit crimes). Later versions of the show featured different variations on the supernatural theme of the show, and include additional characters, such as Scooby's cousin [[Scooby-Dum]] and nephew [[Scrappy-Doo]], in addition to or instead of some of the original characters.

''Scooby-Doo'' was originally broadcast on [[CBS]] from 1969 to 1976, when it moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. ABC cancelled the show in 1986, but presented a spin-off, ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'', from 1988 until 1991. A new ''Scooby-Doo'' series, ''[[What's New, Scooby-Doo?]]'', aired on the [[WB Network]] during the [[Kids' WB!]] programming block from 2002 until 2005. The current ''Scooby-Doo'' series, ''[[Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!]]'', airs Saturday mornings on [[The CW]] network. Repeats of the original series, as well as second-run episodes of ''What's New, Scooby-Doo?'', are broadcast frequently on the [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Boomerang (TV Channel)|Boomerang]] in the [[United States]] and other countries.
==Production history==
===Creation and development===
[[Image:Scooby-doo-early-designs-1968.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Very early designs by [[Iwao Takamoto]] for the ''Mysteries Five'' characters. Left to right, top row: Kelly (Daphne) and Geoff (Fred). Left to right, bottom row: W.W. (Shaggy) and Linda (Velma). ]]
In 1968, [[Fred Silverman]], executive in charge of children's programming for the [[CBS]] network, was looking for a show that would revitalize his Saturday morning line-up and please the watchdog groups at the same time. The result was ''[[The Archie Show]]'', based upon [[Bob Montana]]'s teenage humor comic book ''[[Archie comics|Archie]]''. Also successful were the musical numbers [[The Archies]] performed during each program (one of which, "[[Sugar, Sugar]]", was the most successful ''[[Billboard]]'' number-one hit of 1969). Silverman was eager to expand upon this success, and contacted producers [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] about possibly creating another show based around a teenage rock-group, but with an extra element: the kids would solve mysteries in-between their gigs. Silverman envisioned the show as a cross between the popular ''[[I Love a Mystery]]'' radio serials of the 1940s and the popular early 1960s TV show ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]''.<ref>Laurence Marcus & Stephen R. Hulce (October, 2000). "Scooby Doo, Where Are You". ''Television Heaven''. Retrieved from http://www.Televisionheaven.co.uk/scooby.htm on June 9, 2006.</ref>.

Hanna and Barbera passed this task along to two of their head storymen, [[Joe Ruby]] and [[Ken Spears]], and artist/character designer [[Iwao Takamoto]]. Their original concept of the show bore the title ''Mysteries Five'', and featured five teens (Geoff, Mike, Kelly, Linda, and Linda's brother "W.W.") and their dog, Too Much, who were all in a band called "The Mysteries Five" (even the dog; he played the [[bongos]]). When "The Mysteries Five" weren't performing at gigs, they were out solving spooky mysteries involving ghosts, zombies, and other supernatural creatures.  Ruby and Spears then had to decide what to make their dog. At first, they chose between a large cowardly dog, and a small fiesty dog. When the former was chosen, then the options became a large goofy [[Great Dane]] or a big shaggy [[sheepdog]]. After consulting with Barbera on the issue, Too Much was finally set as a Great Dane, primarily to avoid a direct correlation to The Archies (who had a sheepdog, [[Hot Dog]], in their band. They had feared the great dane would be too similar to [[Marmaduke]] of the [[comic strip]]s, but Barbera assured them it would not be a problem). <ref>Ruby and Spears, "Scooby Doo...The History of a Classic"</ref> 

Takamoto consulted a studio colleague who happened to be a [[dog breeder|breeder]] of Great Danes. After learning the characteristics of a prize-winning Great Dane from her, Takamoto proceeded to break most of the rules and designed Too Much with overly bowed legs, a double-chin, and a sloped back, among other abnormalities.<ref>Ignacio, Cynthia Quimpo (2002). "[http://www.yolk.com/v093/iwao1.html Iwao Takamoto: Scooby-Doo and Iawo, Too]". ''Yolk 2.0.'', vol. 9, issue 3. Los Angeles, CA: Informasian Media Group, Inc.</ref><ref>(2006). Interview with Iwao Takamoto. ''Eerie Mystery of Scooby-Doo and Dynomutt's History'' [documentary featurette from ''The Scooby-Doo/Dynomut Hour: The Complete Series'' DVD bonus features.]. New York, Los Angeles, CA: Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. Excerpt: "The Great Dane was supposed to be the biggest dog around...and there was a woman [at the studio] who actually bred and reared Great Danes. So, she came over, and spent a solid hour describing all of the positive things that makes a prize-wining Great Dane. And I selected about five things, I think, and went in the opposite direction. For instance, a good, strong straight back, so I sloped his back. A strong chin, so I under-swung his chin...and I think straight hind legs she mentioned. So I bowed them..."</ref>

By the time the show was ready for presentation by Silverman, a few more things had changed: Geoff and Mike were merged into one character called "Ronnie" (later renamed "[[Fred Jones (fictional character)|Fred]]", at Silverman's behest<ref>(2006). Interview with Ken Spears. ''Eerie Mystery of Scooby-Doo and Dynomutt's History''. Excerpt: "That character [Fred] started out...I think his name was 'Geoff'...and then he became 'Harvey'. And then all of a sudden, Fred [Silverman] came in and said [the character] was going to be 'Fred'. So, I guess he had something to do with that."</ref>), Kelly was renamed to "[[Daphne Blake|Daphne]]", Linda was now called "[[Velma Dinkley|Velma]]", and [[Norville "Shaggy" Rogers|Shaggy]] (formerly "W.W.") was no longer her brother. Also, Silverman, not being very fond of the name ''Mysteries Five'', had rechristened the show ''Who's S-S-Scared?'' Using storyboards, presentation boards, and a short completed animation sequence, Silverman presented ''Who's S-S-Scared?'' to the CBS executives as the centerpiece for the upcoming 1969&ndash;1970 season's Saturday morning cartoon block. The executives felt that the presentation artwork was far too frightening for young viewers, and, thinking the show would be the same, decided to pass on it.<ref>Ruby and Spears, "Scooby Doo...The History of a Classic"</ref> 

Now without a centerpiece for the upcoming season's programming, Silverman turned to Ruby and Spears, who reworked the show to make it more comedic and less frightening. They dropped the rock band element, and began to focus more attention on Shaggy and Too Much. According to Ruby and Spears, Silverman was inspired by an ad-lib he heard in [[Frank Sinatra]]'s interpretation of [[Bert Kaempfert]]'s song "Strangers in the Night" on the way out to one of their meetings, and decided to rename the dog "[[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]]" and re-rechristened the show ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where are You!]]''<ref>Ruby and Spears, "Scooby Doo...The History of a Classic"</ref> The revised show was re-presented to CBS executives, who approved it for production.

===''Scooby-Doo'' television series===
====The CBS years====
[[Image:Shaggy-scooby-scared-1969.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Shaggy and Scooby-Doo register mutual fear after being confronted by a typical ''Scooby-Doo'' villain, a ghost from outer-space. From ''Scooby-Doo, Where are You!'' season one, episode fourteen ("Spooky Space Kook", [[December 20]], [[1969]]).]]

''[[Scooby-Doo, Where are You!]]'' made its CBS network debut on Saturday, [[September 13]], [[1969]] with its first episode, "What a Night for a Knight". The original voice cast featured [[Don Messick]] as Scooby-Doo, [[Casey Kasem]] as Shaggy, [[Frank Welker]] as Fred, [[Nicole Jaffe]] as Velma, and [[Stefanianna Christopherson]] as Daphne.<ref>(2005) "Scooby Doo, Where are You!" ''IMDb.com'' Retrieved from http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063950/ on August 12, 2006</ref> Seventeen episodes of ''Scooby-Doo'' were produced in 1969.

The influences of ''I Love a Mystery'' and ''Dobie Gillis'' were especially apparent in these early episodes; [[Mark Evanier]], who would write ''Scooby-Doo'' teleplays and comic book scripts in the 1970s and 1980s, identified each of the four teenagers with their corresponding ''Dobie Gillis'' character: "Fred was based on Dobie, Velma on Zelda, Daphne on Thalia and Shaggy on [[Maynard G. Krebs|Maynard]]." <ref>[[Mark Evanier|Evanier, Mark]]. (July 10, 2002). Post on "News from Me" blog for ''Povonline.com''. Retrieved from http://povonline.com/2002/News060902.htm on March 27, 2006.</ref> The similarities between Shaggy and Maynard are the most noticeable; both characters share the same [[beatnik]]-style [[goatee]], similar hairstyles, and demeanours. The roles of each character are strongly defined in the series: Fred is the leader and the determined detective, Velma is the intelligent analyst, Daphne is danger-prone and vain, and Shaggy and Scooby-Doo are cowardly types more motivated by hunger than any desire to solve mysteries. Later versions of the show would make slight changes to the characters' established roles, most notably in the character of Daphne, shown in 1990s and 2000s ''Scooby-Doo'' productions as knowing many forms of karate and being able to defend herself.

The plot of each ''Scooby-Doo'' episode followed a formula that would serve as a template for many of the later incarnations of the series. At the beginning of the episode, the Mystery, Inc. gang bump into some type of evil [[ghost]] or a monster, which they learn has been terrorizing the local populace. The teens offer to help solve the mystery behind the creature, but while looking for clues and suspects, the gang (and in particularly Shaggy and Scooby) run into the monster, who always gives chase. However, after analyzing the clues they have found, the gang determines that this monster is simply a mere mortal in disguise. They capture the monster and have the criminal behind the mask or costume arrested.

''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' was a major ratings success for CBS, and they renewed it for a second season in [[1970 in television|1970]]. The eight 1970 episodes of ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' differed slightly from the first-season episodes in their uses of more [[slapstick]] humor, ''Archie Show''-like "chase songs" during climactic sequences, [[Heather North]] performing the voice of Daphne in place of Christopherson, and a re-recorded theme song. Both seasons contained a [[laugh track]], which was the standard practice for U.S. cartoon series during the 1960s and 1970s.

In [[1972 in television|1972]], after 25 half-hour episodes, the program was doubled to a full hour and called ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]''; each episode of which featured a different guest star helping the gang solve mysteries. Among the most notable of these guest stars were [[The Harlem Globetrotters]], [[The Three Stooges]], [[Don Knotts]], and [[Batman]] & [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], who all appeared at least twice on the show. After two seasons and 24 episodes of the ''New Movies'' format from 1972 to 1974, the show went to reruns of the original series until ''Scooby'' moved to ABC in 1976.

====The ''Scooby'' clones====
[[Image:Scooby-doo-meddling-kids-1970.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Every episode of the original ''Scooby-Doo'' format contains a penultimate scene in which the kids unmask the ghost-of-the-week to reveal a real person in a costume. From ''Scooby-Doo, Where are You!'' season two, episode one ("Nowhere to Hyde", [[September 12]], [[1970]]).]]
Having established a successful formula, Hanna-Barbera then proceeded to repeat it many times over.<ref>Burke, Timothy and Burke, Kevin. ''Saturday Morning Fever''. pg. 110 - 111.</ref> By the time ''Scooby-Doo'' had its first format change in 1972, Hanna-Barbera had produced three other teenager-based shows that were very similar to ''Scooby'' in concept and execution: ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (cartoon)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' (1970), which resurrected the idea of the rock band to the teenage-crime-fighter formula; ''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]'' (1971), which re-imagined the toddlers from ''[[The Flintstones]]'' as high-school students; and the most blatant ''Scooby'' clone, ''[[The Funky Phantom]]'' (also 1971), which featured three teens, a real ghost and his ghostly cat solving spooky mysteries.

Later cartoons such as ''[[The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan]]'' (1972); ''[[Goober and the Ghost Chasers]]'', ''[[Speed Buggy]]'', ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids]]'', and ''[[Inch High, Private Eye]]'' (all 1973); ''[[Clue Club]]'' and'' [[Jabberjaw]]'' (both 1976); ''[[Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels]]'' (1977); ''[[Buford and the Galloping Ghost]]'' (1978); and the ''Pebbles, Dino, and Bamm-Bamm'' segments of ''[[The Flintstones|The Flintstone Funnies]] (1980)'' would all involve groups of teenagers solving mysteries or fighting crime in the same vein as ''Scooby-Doo'', usually with the help of a wacky animal, ghost, etc. For example, ''Speed Buggy'' featured three teens and a talking dune buggy in the role of "Scooby", while ''Jabberjaw'' used four teens and a talking shark.  Some of these shows even used the same [[voice actor]]s and score cues.  Even outside studios got in on the act: when Joe Ruby and Ken Spears left H-B in 1977 and started [[Ruby-Spears Productions]], their first cartoon was ''[[Fangface]],'' yet another mystery-solving ''Scooby'' clone.

During the 1970s, the imitating programs successfully coexisted alongside ''Scooby'' on Saturday mornings. Most of the mystery-solving Hanna-Barbera shows made before 1975 were featured on CBS, and when Fred Silverman moved from CBS to ABC in 1975, the mystery-solving shows, including ''Scooby-Doo'', followed him.

[[Image:Scoob-scrap-1980.jpg|right|thumb|230px|The addition of [[Scrappy-Doo]] (right) to the series in 1979 would coincide with a change in the ''Scooby-Doo'' formula. From the opening credits of ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo''.]]

====The ABC years====
On ABC, the show went through almost yearly format changes. For their 1976 - 1977 season, new episodes of ''[[Scooby-Doo (1976-1979 television series)|Scooby-Doo]]'' were joined with a new H-B show, ''[[Dynomutt, Dog Wonder]]'', to create ''[[The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour]]'' (It became ''[[The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Show]]'' when a bonus ''Scooby-Doo, Where are You!'' rerun was added to it in November 1976). This hour-long package show later evolved into the longer programming blocks ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics]]'' (1977 - 1978) and ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics|Scooby's All-Stars]]'' (1978 - 1979).

New ''Scooby'' episodes, in the original ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' format, were produced for each of these three seasons. Four of these episodes featured Scooby's dim-witted country cousin [[Scooby-Dum]] as a semi-regular character. The ''Scooby-Doo'' episodes produced during these three seasons were later packaged together for syndication as ''The Scooby-Doo Show'', under which title they continue to air. 

In 1979, Scooby's tiny nephew [[Scrappy-Doo]] was added to both the series and the billing, in an attempt to boost ''Scooby-Doo's'' slipping ratings. The 1979&ndash;1980 episodes, aired under the title ''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979 - 1980)|Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo]]'', succeeded in regenerating interest in the show, and as a result, the entire show was overhauled in 1980 to focus on Scrappy-Doo. Fred, Daphne, and Velma were dropped from the series, and the [[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1980 - 1983)|new ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' format]] was now comprised of three seven-minute comedic adventures starring Scooby, Scrappy, and Shaggy instead of one half-hour mystery. This version of ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' aired as part of ''[[The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show]]'' from 1980 to 1982, and as part of ''[[The Scooby-Doo/Scrappy-Doo/Puppy Hour]]'' from 1982 to 1983. Most of the supernatural villains in the seven-minute ''Scooby and Scrappy'' cartoons, who in previous ''Scooby'' series had been revealed to be human criminals in costume, were now "real" within the context of the series.

Daphne returned to the cast for ''[[The All-New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show]]'', which comprised two 11-minute episodes in a format reminiscent of the original ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' mysteries. This version of the show lasted for two seasons, with the second season airing under the title ''The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries'' and featuring semi-regular appearances from Fred and Velma.

1985 saw the debut of ''[[The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo]]'', which featured Daphne, Shaggy, Scooby, Scrappy, and new characters Flim-Flam and Vincent Van Ghoul (based upon and voiced by [[Vincent Price]]) traveling the globe to capture "thirteen of the most terrifying ghosts and ghouls on the face of the earth." ''The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo'' was cancelled in March 1986, and no new ''Scooby'' series aired on the network for the next two years.

Hanna-Barbera reincarnated the original ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' cast as junior high school students for ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'', which debuted on ABC in 1988. ''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'' was an irreverent, zany re-imagining of the series, heavily inspired by the classic cartoons of [[Tex Avery]] and [[Bob Clampett]], and eschewed the quasi-reality of the original ''Scooby'' series for a more ''[[Looney Tunes]]''-like style. The retooled show was a success, and lasted until 1991.

====Reruns and revivals====

[[Image:Shaggy scooby wnsd2.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Scooby-Doo and Shaggy, in a scene from ''[[What's New, Scooby-Doo?]]'']]
Reruns of the show have been in [[television syndication|syndication]] since the mid-1980s, and have also been shown on [[cable television|cable]] [[television network]]s such as [[TBS Superstation]] (until 1989), and [[USA Network]] (as part of the [[USA Cartoon Express]] from 1990 to 1994). In 1993, ''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'', having just recently ended its network run on ABC, began reruns on the [[Cartoon Network]]; the other versions of ''Scooby-Doo'' joined it the following year and became exclusive to Turner networks such as the Cartoon Network, TBS Superstation, and [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]. [[Canadian]] network [[Teletoon]] began airing ''Scooby-Doo, Where are You!'' in 1997, with the other ''Scooby'' series soon following. When TBS and TNT ended their broadcasts of H-B cartoons in 1998, ''Scooby-Doo'' became the exclusive property of both Cartoon Network and sister station [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]].

In 2002, following the successes of the Cartoon Network reruns and four late-1990s [[direct-to-video]] ''Scooby-Doo'' releases, the original version of the gang was updated for the 21st century for ''[[What's New, Scooby-Doo?]]'', which aired on [[Kids WB]] from [[2002 in television|2002]] until [[2005 in television|2005]], with second-run episodes also appearing on Cartoon Network. Unlike previous ''Scooby'' series, the show was produced at [[Warner Bros. Television|Warner Bros. Television Animation]], which had absorbed Hanna-Barbera in 2001. The show returned to the familiar format of the original series for the first time since 1978, with modern-day technology and culture added to the mix to give the series a more contemporary feel, along with new, digitally-recorded sound effects and music. With Don Messick having died in 1997, Frank Welker took over as Scooby's [[voice actor]], while continuing to provide the voice of Fred as well, and [[Casey Kasem]] returned as Shaggy.  [[Grey DeLisle]] now provides the voice of Daphne (she first took the role on ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase]]'', replacing [[Mary Kay Bergman]], who committed suicide shortly before the release of ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders]]'') and former ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|Facts of Life]]'' star [[Mindy Cohn]] voices Velma. However, Scooby-Doo himself was very rarely focused on in most of the show's episodes.

After three seasons, ''What's New, Scooby-Doo'' was replaced in September 2006 with ''[[Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!]]'', a major revamping of the series which debuted on [[The CW]] (a merger of The WB with the [[UPN]] Network). The premise centers around Shaggy inheriting money and a [[mansion]] from an uncle, an inventor who has gone into hiding from villains trying to steal his secret invention. The villains, led by "Dr. Phibes" (based primarily upon [[Dr. Evil]] from the [[Austin Powers]] series), then use different schemes to try to get the invention from Shaggy and Scooby, who handle the plots alone. Fred, Daphne, and Velma are normally absent, but do make appearances at times to help. The characters were redesigned and the art style revised for the new series.

[[Image:Scooby-doo-on-zombie-island.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The direct-to-video film ''[[Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island]]'' marked the first time the original quintet of ''Scooby'' characters had appeared together in their original forms since 1984.]]

===Televisions specials, telefilms, and direct-to-video features===
The ''Scooby-Doo'' characters first appeared outside of their regular Saturday morning format in ''[[Scooby Goes Hollywood]]'', an hour-long ABC television special aired in prime-time on [[December 13]], [[1979]]. The special revolved around Shaggy and Scooby's attempts to have the network move Scooby out of Saturday morning and into a prime-time series ,and featured spoofs of then-current TV shows and films such as ''[[Happy Days]]'', ''[[Superman: The Movie]]'', ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'', and ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''.

From 1986 to 1988, Hanna-Barbera Productions produced ''[[Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10]]'', a series of [[television syndication|syndicated]] [[telefilm]]s featuring their most popular characters, including [[Yogi Bear]], [[Huckleberry Hound]], [[The Flintstones]], and [[The Jetsons]].  Scooby-Doo, Scrappy-Doo, and Shaggy starred in three of these movies: ''[[Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers]]'' (1987), ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf]]'' (1988), and ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School]]'' (1988). In addition, Scooby-Doo and Shaggy appeared as the narrators of the made-for-TV movie ''[[Scooby-Doo in Arabian Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', originally broadcast by [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] in 1994 and later released on video as ''Scooby-Doo in Arabian Nights''.

Starting in 1998, [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Hanna-Barbera]] (by then a subsidiary of [[Warner Bros.]]), began producing one new ''Scooby-Doo'' [[direct-to-video]] movie a year. These movies featured a slightly older version of the original five-character cast from the ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' days, and disregards the later [[Scrappy-Doo]] years as [[canon (fiction)|non-canonical]]. The movies include ''[[Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island]]'' (1998), ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Witch's Ghost]]'' (1999), ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders]]'' (2000), and ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase]]'' (2001). Also in 2001, the Cartoon Network produced ''Night of the Living Doo'', a half-hour parody of the ''New Scooby-Doo Movies'' format featuring "Special guest stars" [[David Cross]], [[Gary Coleman]], and [[Big Bad Voodoo Daddy]].

The success of the direct-to-video movies led to Scooby's return to Saturday morning, ''What's New, Scooby-Doo?'', and Hanna-Barbera based later entries in this series of ''Scooby'' movies on it rather than the previous editions. The series continued with ''Scooby-Doo and the Legend of the Vampire'' (2003), ''Scooby-Doo and the Monster of Mexico'' (2003), ''Scooby-Doo and the Loch Ness Monster'' (2004), ''Aloha, Scooby-Doo!'' (2005), ''[[Scooby Doo in Where's My Mummy?]]'' (2005) and ''[[Scooby-Doo! Pirates Ahoy!]]'' (2006).

{{spoiler}}
A number of these ''Scooby-Doo'' telefilms and direct-to-video features, as well as many of the early-1980s shows featuring Scrappy-Doo, feature the gang encountering actual supernatural beings. In ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School]]'' (1988), Shaggy, Scooby, and Scrappy sign up as gym teachers for Miss Grimwood's school for girls, only to find it is actually a school for [[ghoul]]s, where the trio end up teaching the daughters of the [[Frankenstein]] Monster, [[Dracula]], The [[Werewolf]], [[The Mummy]], and the stereotypical [[ghost]] monster (called the [[Phantom]]). ''[[Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island]]'' (1998) featured the original 1969 gang, reunited after years of being apart, battling [[voodoo]]-worshiping cat creatures in the [[Louisiana]] bayou. The later ''What's New, Scooby-Doo''-based entries in the direct-to-video series returned to the original formula, and are basically extended episodes of the ''What's New, Scooby-Doo'' series. Ironically, in the later movies, Scooby-Doo is not featured as much as the older cartoons, as they tend to focus more on Fred, Daphne and Velma.

===Live-action Warner Bros. feature films===
A [[Scooby-Doo (film)|feature-length live-action film version]] of ''Scooby-Doo'' was released by [[Warner Bros.]] in [[2002 in film|2002]]. The cast included [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]] (Fred), [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] (Daphne), [[Matthew Lillard]] (Shaggy) and [[Linda Cardellini]] (Velma). Scooby-Doo was created on-screen by [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] [[special effect]]s. ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' was extremely successful, with a domestic box office gross of over $130 million.<ref>Chris Suellentrop. (March 26, 2004). "Hey Dog!

[[Image:Scooby doo.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Warner Bros]]' 2002 live-action ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' feature film was a box office success, and resulted in a sequel two years later.]]
Both of these films followed the standard ''Scooby-Doo'' formula, while at the same time parodying various elements of that formula. While the first film had generally original characters as the villains (except for one villain revealed as a surprise plot twist), the second film featured several of the monsters from the television series, including the Black Knight, the 10,000 Volt Ghost, the Pterodactyl Ghost, and the Miner 49er. One could also see Chickenstein, a villain from ''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo.''

==The ''Scooby'' influence==
===Critical reaction and awards===
While a successful series during its three separate tenures on Saturday morning, ''Scooby-Doo'' won no awards for artistic merit during its original series runs. The series has received only two [[Emmy]] nominations in its four-decade history: a 1989 Daytime Emmy nomination for ''A Pup Named Scooby Doo'', and a 2003 Daytime Emmy nomination for ''What's New, Scooby-Doo's'' Mindy Coln in the "Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program" category.<ref> "Awards for ''What's New, Scooby-Doo?''" ''IMDb.com'' Retrieved from http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306274/awards on August 13, 2006.</ref> Like many Hanna-Barbera shows, ''Scooby-Doo'' was criticized for poor production values and formulaic storytelling. In 2002, Jamie Malanowski of the ''New York Times'' commented that "[''Scooby-Doo's''] mysteries are not very mysterious, and the humor is hardly humorous. As for the animation -- well, the drawings on your refrigerator may give it competition."<ref> Malanowski, Jamie (May 12, 2002). "One for the Scooby Cognoscenti". ''The New York Times''.</ref> Even proponents of the series often comment negatively about the formula inherent in most ''Scooby'' episodes. <ref>Burke, Timothy and Burke, Kevin. ''Saturday Morning Fever''. pg. 108.</ref>

Nevertheless, ''Scooby-Doo'' has maintained a significant fan base, which has grown steadily since the 1990s due to the show's popularity among both young children and nostalgic adults who grew up with the series. <ref> Berardinelli, James (June 2002). Review for ''Scooby-Doo'' [feature film]. ''James Berardinelli's Movie Reviews.'' Retrieved from http://movie-reviews.colossus.net/movies/s/scooby-doo.html on August 13, 2006. Excerpt: "Unfortunately, there is an audience out there for Scooby-Doo. It is comprised primarily of Generation X'ers, who wax nostalgic about the "classic" cartoon series, and their children, who are too young to know any better."</ref> The show's mix of the comedy-adventure and horror genres is often noted as the reason for its widespread success.<ref> Elias, Justine (Feb. 24, 2002). "Scooby-Doo Forever: The Curious Cachet of a Cowardly Dog." ''The New York Times''. Excerpt: "Both the [Cartoon Network] and children's TV critics point to ''Scooby's'' mix of thrills, gas and reassurance as the key to its longevity."</ref> As Fred Silverman and the Hanna-Barbera staff had planned when they first began producing the series, ''Scooby-Doo's'' ghosts, monsters, and spooky locales tend more towards humor than horror, making them easily accessible to younger children. "Overall, [''Scooby-Doo'' is] just not a show that is going to over stimulate kids' emotions and tensions," offered American Center for Children and Media executive director David Kleeman in a 2002 interview. "It creates just enough fun to make it fun without getting them worried or giving them nightmares." <ref>Elias, Justine. "Scooby-Doo Forever."</ref> Many teenage and young adult audiences enjoy ''Scooby-Doo'' because of presumed subversive themes which involve theories of drug use and sexuality.<ref>Burke, Timothy and Burke, Kevin.

In recent years, ''Scooby-Doo'' has received recognition for its popularity by placing in a number of "top cartoon" or "top cartoon character" polls. The August 3, 2002 issue of ''[[TV Guide]]'' featured its list of the "50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time", in which Scooby-Doo placed twenty-second <ref> (Aug. 22, 2002). 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time". ''TV Guide''.</ref> Scooby also ranked thirteenth in [[Animal Planet]]'s list of the "50 Greatest TV Animals".<ref>(Jun 20, 2003). "Animal Planet Picks Top 50 TV Animals". ''Scoop''. Retrieved from http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/scoop_article.asp?ai=2787&si=121 on August 13, 2006.</ref> ''Scooby-Doo, Where are You!'' ranked forty-ninth in the UK network [[Channel 4]]'s 2005 list of the "100 Greatest Cartoons of All Time". <ref>(2005). "The 100 Greatest Cartoons of All Time". ''Channel4.com''. Retrieved from http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/cartoons/results.html on August 13, 2006. </ref> For one year from 2004 to 2005, ''Scooby-Doo'' held the Guinness World Record for having the most episodes of any animated television series ever produced, a record previously held by and later returned to ''[[The Simpsons]]''. ''Scooby-Doo'' was published as holding this record in the 2006 edition of the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]''. <ref>(25 Oct. 2004). "''Scooby-Doo'' breaks cartoon record". ''BBC News''. Retrieved from http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3949579.stm on March 27, 2006.</ref>.

Subsequent television shows and films often make reference to ''Scooby-Doo'', for example ''[[Wayne's World  (film)|Wayne's World]]'' and the television series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', in which Buffy and her monster-slaying friends refer to themselves as the "[[Scooby Gang]]" or "Scoobies," a knowing reference to ''Scooby-Doo''. (Coincidentally, [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], who played Buffy, later played Daphne in the live-action movies.) Even ''[[South Park]]'' paid homage to Scooby-Doo in an episode entitled "[[Korn|Ko<U+042F>n]]'s Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery". The [[Kevin Smith]] film ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'' included a scene where Jay and Silent Bob are picked up in the Mystery Machine while hitchhiking and both they and Mystery, Inc. get "high" off of "dooby snacks". A plethora of other media properies have referenced or parodied ''Scooby-Doo'', among them the ''[[TV Funhouse]]'' segment of [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' , the online comic ''[[Sluggy Freelance]]'', the FOX animated series ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and the Cartoon Network programs ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy]]'', and ''[[The Venture Bros.]]''.

===Assumed "adult themes"===
As with many Saturday morning cartoons, ''Scooby-Doo'' is often proposed by sectors of the public to have hidden subtexts, in this case involving sex and drug use. Such assumptions often find their way into ''Scooby-Doo'' parodies done by comedians, musicians, and film/television producers.

Drug use is the most prominent of these charges, in particular because of Shaggy's [[beatnik]] origins. He and Scooby-Doo are shown to have voracious appetites, which has been interpreted as being evidence of a case of "the munchies" resulting from [[cannibis|marijuana]] use. Some parodies go on to propose that the "Scooby Snacks" present in many episodes contain drugs instead of typical dog treat ingredients.<ref>Larsen, Dana (Jan. 8, 2003). "Celebrity stoners." ''Cannabis Culture Magazine''. Retrieved from http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/2606.html on August 11, 2006.</ref> The most direct references to the ''Scooby-Doo'' drug use theory were produced by Warner Bros. and Cartoon Network themselves. A ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' episode finds Shaggy and Scooby-Doo arrested for "possession", while the first ''Scooby-Doo'' film makes several joking references to Shaggy and Scooby's proposed drug use, and has Shaggy fall in love with a girl named "Mary Jane" (a name also used as a slang term for marijuana). Or in Scooby-Doo 2: Monster's Unleashed, it shows that Shaggy's fans were stoners and Shaggy recognized them by sniffing the air when he smelled smoke.<ref>Larsen, Dana. "Celebrity stoners."</ref>. Another speculation is that Scooby-Doo's full name is Scooby Dooby Doo; a "doobie" is slang term for marijuana when it is wrapped in cigarette paper. These "drug use" themes seem to be misplaced due to an episode of ''[[A Pup Named Scooby Doo]]'' showing Scooby and his friends finding drugs. When Velma finds the drugs, Scooby says "Drugs?! Yuck!" 

Also discussed and parodied are the presumed sexual activities going on among the ''Scooby-Doo'' characters. While working on the original series, Joe Ruby and Ken Spears often wrote their "[[Double act|straight men]]", Fred and Daphne, out of the episode so that they could focus on their "comedians": Shaggy, Scooby, and Velma.<ref>Ruby and Spears, "Scooby Doo...The History of a Classic"</ref> As a result, Fred and Daphne are missing from a significant amount of the action in most episodes, leading to assumptions that the two are off having sexual intercourse instead of finding clues.<ref>Burke, Timothy and Burke, Kevin. ''Saturday Morning Fever''. pg. 106.</ref> Like the drug use, this assumed theme has also been self parodied, with the "Bravo Dooby Doo" episode of ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', and both live-action and direct-to-video ''Scooby-Doo'' features making light of Fred and Daphne's presumed sexual relationship.

Another debated topic of the series centers around whether or not the tomboyish Velma is a [[lesbian]]. The character has a considerable fan base among real-life lesbians, who see her as one of their own.<ref>Burke, Timothy and Burke, Kevin. ''Saturday Morning Fever''. pg. 106.</ref> The idea of Velma as a lesbian is parodied in the [[2001]] motion picture ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'', as well as in both ''Scooby-Doo'' live action films. Many, but not all, of the lesbian-themed gags from the first ''Scooby-Doo'' film, which center around a hinted crush Velma has on Daphne, were excised from the final release print to secure a [[MPAA rating system|"PG" rating]]. Also, in [[Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]], Velma has a crush on Patrick, this giving much more sign that she is not [[lesbian]].

[[Image:IMG 1794.JPG|240px|thumb|right|A 1968 Chevrolet Sportvan 108, painted to look like the Mystery Machine from ''Scooby-Doo''. A number of ''Scooby'' fans have decorated vans in this fashion.]]

==Merchandising==
The first ''Scooby-Doo''-related merchandise came in the form of ''Scooby-Doo, Where are You!'' [[comic books]] by [[Gold Key Comics]], which initially contained adaptations of episodes of the cartoon show when publication began in December 1969. The book soon moved to all-original stories, with many of the stories published up to December, 1974. [[Charlton Comics|Charlton]] published ''Scooby'' comics, many drawn by Bill Williams, from February 1975 to October 1975. Since then, ''Scooby-Doo'' comics have been published by [[Marvel Comics]] (written by [[Mark Evanier]] and drawn by [[Dan Spiegle]]) , [[Archie Comics]] (reprints of the Charlton stories), and by [[DC Comics]], who continue to publish a monthly ''Scooby-Doo'' series.

Other early ''Scooby-Doo'' merchandise included a 1973 [[Milton Bradley]] [[board game]], decorated [[lunch box]]es, iron-on transfers, [[coloring books]], story books, [[vinyl record|records]], underwear, and other such goods.<ref>"Scooby-Doo according ot Wingnut: Collectables". ''Wingnuttoons.com.'' Retrieved from http://www.wingnuttoons.com/Scooby-Doo_Collection2.html on August 12, 2006. Contains an extensive illustrated list of ''Scooby-Doo''-related merchandise, from the 1970s to the present.</ref> When Scrappy-Doo was introduced to the series in 1979, he, Scooby, and Shaggy became the sole foci of much of the merchandising, including a 1983 Milton-Bradley ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' board game. The first ''Scooby-Doo'' video game appeared in arcades in 1986, and has been followed by a number of games for both home-consoles and personal computers. ''Scooby-Doo'' [[multivitamins]] also debuted at this time, and have been manufactured by [[Bayer]] since 2001.

''Scooby-Doo'' merchandising tapered off during the late 1980s and early 1990s, but increased after the series' revival on Cartoon Network in 1995. Today, all manner of ''Scooby-Doo''-branded products are available for purchase, including ''Scooby-Doo'' [[breakfast cereal]], plush toys, action figures, car decorations, and much more. Real "Scooby Snacks" dog treats are produced by Del Monte Pet Products. [[Hasbro]] has created a number of ''Scooby'' board games, including a ''Scooby''-themed edition of the popular mystery board game ''[[Cluedo|Clue]]''.

From 1990 to 2002, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo appeared as characters in the ''[[Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera]]'' simulator ride at [[Universal Studios Florida]] <ref>Stokes, Trey (2002). "The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera". Retrieved from http://www.trudang.com/simulatr/hbsim.html on August 12, 2006. Article on the creation of the ride, written by one of its programmers.</ref> The ride was restructured in the early 2000s as a ''[[Jimmy Neutron]]'' attraction. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo are costumed characters at Universal Studios Florida, and can be found driving the Mystery Machine around the park.
