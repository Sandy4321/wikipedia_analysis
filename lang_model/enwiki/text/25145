'''''Fight Club''''' is a 1999 American film based on the 1996 [[Fight Club (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Chuck Palahniuk]]. The film was directed by [[David Fincher]] and stars [[Edward Norton]], [[Brad Pitt]], and [[Helena Bonham Carter]]. Norton plays the unnamed protagonist, an "[[everyman]]" who is discontented with his [[white-collar worker|white-collar job]] in American society. He forms a "fight club" with soap maker Tyler Durden, played by Pitt, and becomes embroiled in a relationship with him and a dissolute woman, Marla Singer, played by Bonham Carter.

Palahniuk's novel was [[option (filmmaking)|optioned]] by [[20th Century Fox]] producer [[Laura Ziskin]], who hired [[Jim Uhls]] to write the film adaptation. Fincher was one of four directors the producers considered; they hired him because of his enthusiasm for the film. Fincher developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. The director and the cast compared the film to ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955) and ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967). Fincher intended ''Fight Club''{{'}}s violence to serve as a metaphor for the conflict between a generation of young people and the [[value system]] of advertising. The director copied the [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] overtones from Palahniuk's novel to make audiences uncomfortable and keep them from anticipating the [[twist ending]].<ref name="fiction" />

Studio executives did not like the film, and they restructured Fincher's intended marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses. ''Fight Club'' failed to meet the studio's expectations at the box office, and received polarized reactions from critics. It was cited as one of the most controversial and talked-about films of 1999. However, the film later found commercial success with its DVD release, which established ''Fight Club'' as a [[cult film]]. Critical reception of ''Fight Club'' has since become more positive as well.
== Plot ==
The nameless narrator (Norton) is a traveling automobile company employee who suffers from [[insomnia]]. His doctor refuses to give him medication and advises him to visit a [[support group]] to witness more severe suffering. The narrator<!-- his name is not Jack --> attends a support group for [[testicular cancer]] victims and, after fooling them into thinking that he is a fellow victim, finds an emotional release that relieves his insomnia. He becomes addicted to attending support groups and pretending to be a victim, but the presence of another impostor, Marla Singer (Bonham Carter), disturbs him, so he negotiates with her to avoid their meeting at the same groups.

After a flight home from a business trip, the narrator finds his apartment destroyed by an explosion. He calls Tyler Durden (Pitt), a soap salesman whom he befriended on the flight, and they meet at a bar. A conversation about [[consumerism]] leads to Tyler inviting the narrator to stay at his place; outside the bar he requests that the narrator hit him. The two engage in a fistfight, and the narrator subsequently moves into Tyler's dilapidated house. They have further fights outside the bar, and these attract a crowd of men. The fighting moves to the bar's basement where the men form a "fight club".

Marla overdoses on pills and telephones the narrator for help; he ignores her, but Tyler answers the call and saves her. Tyler and Marla become sexually involved, and Tyler warns the narrator never to talk to Marla about him. More fight clubs form across the country, and under Tyler's leadership, they become the anti-materialist and anti-corporate organization called "Project Mayhem". The narrator complains to Tyler that he wants to be more involved in the organization, but Tyler suddenly disappears. When a member of Project Mayhem is killed by the police during a botched sabotage operation, the narrator tries to shut down the project, and follows evidence of Tyler's national travels to track him down. In one city, a Project member greets the narrator as Tyler Durden. The narrator calls Marla from his hotel room and discovers that Marla also believes him to be Tyler. He suddenly sees Tyler Durden in his room, and Tyler explains that they are [[Dissociative identity disorder|dissociated personalities]] in the same body. Tyler controls the narrator's body when the narrator is asleep.

The narrator blacks out after the conversation. When he wakes, he discovers from his telephone log that Tyler made calls during his blackout. He uncovers Tyler's plans to erase debt by destroying buildings that contain credit card companies' records. The narrator tries to contact the police but finds that the officers are members of the Project. He attempts to disarm explosives in a building, but Tyler subdues him and moves to a safe building to watch the destruction. The narrator, held by Tyler at gunpoint, realizes that in sharing the same body with Tyler, he himself is actually holding the gun. He fires it into his mouth, shooting through the cheek without killing himself. Tyler collapses with an exit wound to the back of his head, and the narrator stops mentally projecting him. Afterward, Project Mayhem members bring a kidnapped Marla to him, believing him to be Tyler, and leave them alone. The explosives detonate, collapsing the buildings, and the narrator and Marla watch the scene, holding hands.

{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="We're designed to be hunters and we're in a society of shopping. There's nothing to kill anymore, there's nothing to fight, nothing to overcome, nothing to explore. In that societal emasculation this everyman [the narrator] is created."|source=<U+2014>David Fincher<ref name="smith64" />}}
Fincher said ''Fight Club'' was a [[coming of age]] film, like the 1967 film ''[[The Graduate]]'' but for people in their 30s. Fincher described the narrator as an "[[everyman]]";<ref name="smith64">{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|p=64}}</ref> the character is identified in the script as "Jack", but left nameless in the film.<ref>{{cite journal | title = 100 DVDs You Must Own | pages = 31 | journal = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | month=January | year=2003 }}</ref> Fincher outlined the narrator's background: "He's tried to do everything he was taught to do, tried to fit into the world by becoming the thing he isn't." The narrator cannot find happiness, so he travels on a path to enlightenment in which he must "kill" his parents, his god, and his teacher. At the start of the film, he has killed his parents. With Tyler Durden, he kills his god by doing things they are not supposed to do. To complete the process of maturing, the narrator has to kill his teacher, Tyler Durden.<ref name="smith60">{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|p=60}}</ref>

The character is a 1990s inverse of ''The Graduate'' archetype: "a guy who does ''not'' have a world of possibilities in front of him, he has ''no'' possibilities, he literally cannot imagine a way to change his life". He is confused and enraged, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] ''[[<U+00DC>bermensch]]'', in his mind. While Tyler is who the narrator would want to be, he is not empathetic and does not help the narrator face decisions in his life "that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications". Fincher explained, "[Tyler] can deal with the concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn't have anything to do with the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: You're not really necessary to a lot of what's going on. It's built, it just needs to run now."<ref name="smith64" /> While studio executives worried that ''Fight Club'' was going to be "sinister and seditious", Fincher sought to make it "funny and seditious" by including humor to temper the sinister element.<ref name="empire" />

Uhls described the film as a "romantic comedy", explaining, "It has to do with the characters' attitudes toward a healthy relationship, which is a lot of behavior which ''seems'' unhealthy and harsh to each other, but in fact does work for them<U+2014>because both characters are out on the edge psychologically."<ref>{{cite web | first=Michael | last=Sragow | url=http://www.salon.com/ent/col/srag/1999/10/14/fincher/index1.html | title=Testosterama | work=[[Salon.com]] | date=October&nbsp;14, 1999 | accessdate=December&nbsp;2, 2007 }}</ref> The narrator seeks intimacy, but he avoids it with Marla Singer, seeing too much of himself in her.<ref name="DVDcom" /> While Marla is a seductive and negativist prospect for the narrator, he instead embraces the novelty and excitement that comes with befriending Tyler Durden. The narrator is comfortable being personally connected to Tyler Durden, but he becomes jealous when Tyler becomes sexually involved with Marla. When the narrator argues with Tyler about their friendship, Tyler tells him that being friends is secondary to pursuing the philosophy they have been exploring.<ref name="reel" /> Tyler also suggests doing something about Marla, implying that she is a risk to be removed. When Tyler says this, the narrator realizes that his desires should have been focused on Marla and begins to diverge from Tyler's path.<ref name="DVDcom" />

The violence of the fight clubs serves not to promote or glorify physical combat, but for participants to experience [[feeling]] in a society where they are otherwise numb.<ref>{{cite web | first=Michael | last=Moses | url=http://www.drdrew.com/article.asp?id=198 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071211235459/http://www.drdrew.com/article.asp?id=198 | archivedate=December&nbsp;11, 2007 | title=Fighting Words: An interview with Fight Club director David Fincher | work=DrDrew.com | publisher=[[Drew Pinsky|Dr. Drew]] | year=1999 | accessdate=May 13, 2009}}</ref> The fights tangibly represent a resistance to the impulse to be "cocooned" in society.<ref name="calgary" /> Norton believed that the fighting between the men strips away the "fear of pain" and "the reliance on material signifiers of their self-worth", leaving them to experience something valuable.<ref name="showbiz" /> When the fights evolve into revolutionary violence, the film only half-accepts the revolutionary [[dialectic]] by Tyler Durden; the narrator pulls back and rejects Durden's ideas.<ref name="reel" /> ''Fight Club'' purposely shapes an ambiguous message, the interpretation of which is left to the audience.<ref name="talk">{{cite journal | first=Graham | last=Fuller | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_11_29/ai_57590231 | title=Fighting Talk | journal=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] | month=November |year=1999 | volume=24 | issue=5 | pages=1071<U+2013>7 | pmid=10509287 | doi=10.1053/jhsu.1999.1281 | accessdate=July&nbsp;19, 2009 | last2=Eidelman | first2=D | last3=Thomson | first3=JG }}</ref> Fincher elaborated, "I love this idea that you can have [[fascism]] without offering any direction or solution.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
The novel ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' by [[Chuck Palahniuk]] was published in 1996. Before its publication, a [[20th Century Fox]] book scout sent a [[galley proof]] of the novel to creative executive Kevin McCormick. The executive tasked a studio reader to review the proof as a candidate for a film adaptation, but the reader discouraged it. McCormick then forwarded the proof to producers [[Lawrence Bender]] and [[Art Linson]], who also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell saw potential and expressed interest. They arranged unpaid screen readings with actors to determine the script's length, and an initial reading lasted six hours. The producers cut out sections to reduce the running time, and they used the shorter script to record its dialogue. Bell sent the recording to [[Laura Ziskin]], head of the division [[Fox 2000]], who listened to the tape and purchased the rights to ''Fight Club'' from Palahniuk for $10,000.<ref name="mav1">{{Harvnb|Waxman|2005|pp=137<U+2013>151}}</ref>

Ziskin initially considered hiring [[Buck Henry]] to write the adaptation, finding ''Fight Club'' similar to the 1967 film ''[[The Graduate]]'', which Henry had adapted. When a new screenwriter, Jim Uhls, lobbied Donen and Bell for the job, the producers chose him over Henry. Bell contacted four directors to direct the film. He considered [[Peter Jackson]] the best choice, but Jackson was too busy filming the 1996 film ''[[The Frighteners]]'' in New Zealand. [[Bryan Singer]] received the book but did not read it. [[Danny Boyle]] met with Bell and read the book, but he pursued another film. [[David Fincher]], who had read ''Fight Club'' and tried to buy the rights himself, talked with Ziskin about directing the film. He hesitated to accept the assignment with 20th Century Fox at first because he had an unpleasant experience directing the 1992 film ''[[Alien 3]]'' for the studio. To repair his relationship with the studio, he met with Ziskin and studio head Bill Mechanic.<ref name="mav1" /> In August 1997, 20th Century Fox announced that Fincher would direct the film adaptation of ''Fight Club''.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Michael | last=Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116678264.html?categoryid=3&cs=1 | title=Thornton holds reins of 'Horses' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=August&nbsp;19, 1997 | accessdate=March&nbsp;23, 2007 }}</ref>

Producer Ross Bell met with actor [[Russell Crowe]] to discuss his candidacy for the role of Tyler Durden. Producer Art Linson, who joined the project late, met with another candidate, Brad Pitt. Linson was the senior producer of the two, so the studio sought to cast Pitt instead of Crowe.<ref name="mav1" /> Pitt was looking for a new film after the failure of his 1998 film ''[[Meet Joe Black]]'', and the studio believed ''Fight Club'' would be more commercially successful with a major star. The studio signed Pitt and offered him a $17.5&nbsp;million salary.<ref name="mav2" />

For the role of the nameless narrator, the studio desired a "sexier marquee name" like [[Matt Damon]] to increase the film's commercial prospects; it also considered [[Sean Penn]]. Fincher instead considered Edward Norton a candidate for the role, based on the actor's performance in the 1996 film ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]''.<ref name="vanity">{{cite journal | first=Peter | last=Biskind | url= | title=Extreme Norton | journal=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | year=1999 | month=August }}</ref> Other studios were approaching Norton for leading roles in developing films like ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'' and ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]''. The actor was cast in ''[[Runaway Jury]]'', but the film did not reach production. 20th Century Fox offered Norton a $2.5&nbsp;million salary to attract him to ''Fight Club''. Norton could not accept the offer immediately since he still owed [[Paramount Pictures]] a film. He signed a contractual obligation with Paramount to appear in one of the studio's future films for a smaller salary. (Norton satisfied the obligation with his role in the 2003 film ''[[The Italian Job (2003 film)|The Italian Job]]'').<ref name="mav2" />

In January 1998, 20th Century Fox announced that Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were cast in the film.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Chris | last=Petrikin | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117434297.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Studio Report Card: Fox | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=January&nbsp;7, 1998 | accessdate=March&nbsp;23, 2007 }}</ref> The actors prepared for their roles by taking lessons in [[boxing]], [[taekwondo]], [[grappling]],<ref name="details">{{cite journal | first=Stephen | last=Garrett | url= | title=Freeze Frame | journal=[[Details (magazine)|Details]] | year=1999 | month=July }}</ref> and [[soapmaking]].<ref>{{cite journal | first=Johanna | last=Schneller | url= | title=Brad Pitt and Edward Norton make 'Fight Club' | journal=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]] | year=1999 | month=August}}</ref> Pitt voluntarily visited a dentist to have pieces of his front teeth chipped off so his character would not have perfect teeth.

=== Writing ===
Screenwriter Jim Uhls started working on an early draft of the adapted screenplay, which excluded a [[voice-over]] because the industry perceived at the time that the technique was "hackneyed and trite". When Fincher joined the film, he thought that the film should have a voice-over, believing that the film's humor came from the narrator's voice.<ref name="mav2">{{harvnb|Waxman|2005|pp=175<U+2013>184}}</ref> The director described the film without a voice-over as seemingly "sad and pathetic".<ref name="smith61">{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|p=61}}</ref> Fincher and Uhls revised the script for six to seven months and by 1997 had a third draft that reordered the story and left out several major elements. When Pitt was cast, he was concerned that his character, Tyler Durden, was too one-dimensional. Fincher sought the advice of writer-director [[Cameron Crowe]], who suggested giving the character more ambiguity. Fincher also hired screenwriter [[Andrew Kevin Walker]] for assistance. The director invited Pitt and Norton to help revise the script, and the group drafted five revisions in the course of a year.<ref name="mav2" />

Chuck Palahniuk praised the faithful film adaptation of his novel and applauded how the film's plot was more streamlined than the book's. Palahniuk recalled how the writers debated if film audiences would believe the plot twist from the novel. Fincher supported including the twist, arguing, "If they accept everything up to this point, they'll accept the plot twist. If they're still in the theater, they'll stay with it."<ref name="dvdtalk">{{cite web | last=Kleinman | first=Geoffrey | url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/interviews/chuck_palahniuk.html | title=Interview With Fight Club Author Chuck Palahniuk | work=DVD Talk | accessdate=March&nbsp;23, 2007 }}</ref> Palahniuk's novel also contained [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] overtones, which the director included in the film to make audiences uncomfortable and accentuate the surprise of the film's twists.<ref name="fiction">{{cite news | first=Louis B. | last=Hobson | url= | title=Fiction for real | work=[[Calgary Sun]] | date=October&nbsp;10, 1999 }}</ref> The bathroom scene where Tyler Durden bathes next to the narrator is an example of the overtones; the line, "I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need," was meant to suggest personal responsibility rather than homosexuality.<ref name="DVDcom" /> Another example is the scene at the beginning of the film in which Tyler Durden puts a gun barrel down the narrator's mouth.<ref>{{cite web | first=Stephen | last=Schaefer | url=http://mrshowbiz.go.com/news/Todays_Stories/991013/fightclubauthor101399.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010416022913/mrshowbiz.go.com/news/Todays_Stories/991013/fightclubauthor101399.html | title=Fight Club's Controversial Cut | work=MrShowbiz.com | publisher=ABC News Internet Ventures | archivedate=April&nbsp;16, 2001 | date=October&nbsp;13, 1999 | accessdate=December&nbsp;2, 2007 }}</ref>

=== Filming ===

Studio executives Mechanic and Ziskin planned an initial budget of $23&nbsp;million to finance the film,<ref name="mav1" /> but by the start of production, the budget was increased to $50&nbsp;million. Half was paid by [[New Regency]], but during filming, the projected budget escalated to $67&nbsp;million. New Regency's head and ''Fight Club'' executive producer [[Arnon Milchan]] petitioned Fincher to reduce costs by at least $5&nbsp;million. The director refused, so Milchan threatened Mechanic that New Regency would withdraw financing. Mechanic sought to restore Milchan's support by sending him tapes of [[dailies]] from ''Fight Club''. After seeing three weeks of filming, Milchan reinstated New Regency's financial backing.<ref name="mav3">{{harvnb|Waxman|2005|pp=199<U+2013>202}}</ref> The final production budget was $63&nbsp;million.<ref name="mojo" />

There was far too much transportation going on."<ref>{{cite news | first=Colin | last=Covert | url= | title=Fear factor is Fincher's forte | work=[[Star Tribune]] | date=March&nbsp;29, 2002 }}</ref>

=== Cinematography ===
Fincher used the [[Super 35]] format to film ''Fight Club'' since it gave him maximum flexibility in composing shots. He hired [[Jeff Cronenweth]] as cinematographer; Cronenweth's father [[Jordan Cronenweth]] was the cinematographer who worked for Fincher on the 1992 film ''[[Alien 3]]'' but died midway through its production. Fincher explored visual styles in his previous films ''[[Seven (film)|Seven]]'' and ''The Game'', and he and Cronenweth drew elements from these styles for ''Fight Club''.<ref name="anarchy" />

They applied a lurid style, choosing to make people "sort of shiny".<ref name="comment65" /> The appearance of the narrator's scenes without Tyler Durden were bland and realistic. The scenes with Tyler were described by Fincher as "more hyper-real in a torn-down, deconstructed sense<U+2014>a visual metaphor of what [the narrator is] heading into". The filmmakers used heavily desaturated colors in the costuming, makeup, and art direction.<ref name="anarchy" /> Helena Bonham Carter wore opalescent makeup to portray her romantic nihilistic character with a "[[Heroin|smack]]-fiend patina". Fincher and Cronenweth drew influences from the 1973 film ''[[American Graffiti]]'', which applied a mundane look to nighttime exteriors while simultaneously including a variety of colors.<ref name="comment65">{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|p=65}}</ref>

The crew took advantage of both natural and practical light at filming locations. The director sought various approaches to the lighting setups, for example choosing several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. He and the crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light the prostheses depicting the characters' injuries.<ref name="anarchy" /> On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were less visible, citing cinematographer [[Gordon Willis]]'s technique as the influence.<ref name="DVDcom" />

''Fight Club'' was filmed mostly at night and Fincher purposely filmed the daytime shots in shadowed locations. The crew equipped the bar's basement with inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes in the basement and instead placed the camera in a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera from the viewpoint of a distant observer to that of the fighter.<ref name="anarchy" />

The scenes with Tyler Durden were staged to conceal that the character was a mental projection of the nameless narrator. The character was not filmed in [[two shot]]s with a group of people, nor was he shown in any [[over the shoulder shot]]s in scenes where Tyler gives the narrator specific ideas to manipulate him. In scenes before the narrator meets Tyler, the filmmakers inserted Tyler's presence in single frames for [[subliminal message|subliminal effect]].<ref name="comment65" /> Tyler appears in the background and out of focus, like a "little devil on the shoulder".<ref name="DVDcom" /> Fincher explained the subliminal frames: "Our hero is creating Tyler Durden in his own mind, so at this point he exists only on the periphery of the narrator's consciousness."<ref name="cinefex" />

While Cronenweth generally rated and exposed the Kodak [[film stock]] normally on ''Fight Club'', several other techniques were applied to change its appearance. [[Flashing (cinematography)|Flashing]] was implemented on much of the exterior night photography, the [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] was stretched to be purposely ugly, the print was adjusted to be [[exposure (photography)|underexposed]], [[Technicolor]]'s ENR [[bleach bypass|silver retention]] was used on a select number of prints to increase the [[optical density|density]] of the film's blacks, and high-contrast print stocks were chosen to create a "stepped-on" look on the print with a dirty [[patina]].<ref name="comment65" />

=== Visual effects ===
Fincher hired [[visual effects supervisor]] Kevin Tod Haug, who worked for him on ''The Game'', to create visual effects for ''Fight Club''. Haug assigned the visual effects artists and experts to different facilities that each addressed different types of visual effects: CG modeling, animation, compositing, and scanning. Haug explained, "We selected the best people for each aspect of the effects work, then coordinated their efforts. In this way, we never had to play to a facility's weakness." Fincher visualized the narrator's perspective through a "[[mind's eye]]" view and structured a [[myopia|myopic]] framework for the film audiences. Fincher also utilized [[previsualization|previsualized]] footage of challenging main-unit and visual effects shots as a problem-solving tool to avoid making mistakes during the actual filming.<ref name="cinefex">{{cite journal | first=Kevin H. | last=Martin | url= | title=A World of Hurt | journal=[[Cinefex]] | year = 2000 | month = January }}</ref>

The network was mapped using an [[L-system]] and drawn out by a medical illustrator.]]
The film's title sequence is a 90-second visual effects composition that depicts the inside of the narrator's brain at a microscopic level; the camera pulls back to the outside, starting at his fear center and following the thought processes initiated by his fear impulse.<ref name="comment61<U+2013>62">{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|pp=61<U+2013>62}}</ref> The sequence, designed in part by Fincher, was budgeted separately from the rest of the film at first, but the sequence was awarded by the studio in January 1999.<ref name="cinefex" /> Fincher hired [[Digital Domain]] and its visual effects supervisor Kevin Mack, who won an [[Academy Award for Visual Effects]] for the 1998 film ''[[What Dreams May Come (film)|What Dreams May Come]]'', for the sequence. The company mapped the computer-generated brain using an [[L-system]],<ref>{{cite journal | first=Mark | last=Frauenfelder | authorlink=Mark Frauenfelder | url= | title=Hollywood's Head Case | journal=[[Wired magazine|Wired]] | year=1999 | month=August }}</ref> and the design was detailed using renderings by medical illustrator Katherine Jones. The pullback sequence from within the brain to the outside of the skull included [[neuron]]s, [[action potential]]s, and a [[hair follicle]]. Haug explained the artistic license that Fincher took with the shot, "While he wanted to keep the brain passage looking like [[electron microscopy|electron microscope photography]], that look had to be coupled with the feel of a night dive<U+2014>wet, scary, and with a low depth of field." The shallow [[depth of field]] was accomplished with the [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] process.<ref name="cinefex" />

Other visual effects include an early scene in which the camera flashes past city streets to survey Project Mayhem's destructive equipment lying in underground parking lots; the sequence was a three-dimensional composition of nearly 100&nbsp;photographs of [[Los Angeles]] and [[Century City]] by photographer Michael Douglas Middleton. The final scene of the demolition of the credit card office buildings was designed by Richard Baily of Image Savant; Baily worked on the scene for over fourteen&nbsp;months.<ref name="cinefex" />

Midway through the film, Tyler Durden points out the [[cue mark]]<U+2014>nicknamed "cigarette burn" in the film<U+2014>to the audience. The scene represents a turning point that foreshadows the coming rupture and inversion of the "fairly subjective reality" that existed earlier in the film. The director explained, "Suddenly it's as though the projectionist missed the changeover, the viewers have to start looking at the movie in a whole new way."<ref name="cinefex" />

=== Musical score ===
Fincher was concerned that bands experienced in writing [[film score]]s would be unable to tie the movie's themes together, so he sought a band which had never recorded for film. He pursued [[Radiohead]],<ref name="DVDcom" /> but ultimately chose the [[breakbeat]] producing duo [[Dust Brothers]] to score the film. The duo created a post-modern score that included drum loops, electronic scratches, and computerized samples. Dust Brothers performer [[Michael Simpson (producer)|Michael Simpson]] explained the setup: "Fincher wanted to break new ground with everything about the movie, and a nontraditional score helped achieve that."<ref>{{cite news | first=Amanda | last=Schurr | url= | title=Score one for musicians turned film composers | work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] | date=November&nbsp;19, 1999}}</ref> During the end credits, the song "[[Where Is My Mind?]]" by the [[Pixies]] is featured.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Spitz | first=Marc | month=September | year=2004 | title=Life to the Pixies | journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] | page=77 }} "[Kim] Deal: I think [that last scene in] ''Fight Club'' got 'Where Is My Mind?' popular.

=== Marketing ===
Filming concluded in December 1998, and David Fincher edited the footage in early 1999 to prepare ''Fight Club'' for a screening with senior executives. They did not receive the film positively and were concerned that there would not be an audience for the film.<ref name="mav4">{{harvnb|Waxman|2005|pp=253<U+2013>273}}</ref> Executive producer [[Art Linson]], who supported the film, recalled the response: "So many incidences of ''Fight Club'' were alarming, no group of executives could narrow them down."<ref>{{harvnb|Linson|2002|p=152}}</ref> Nevertheless, ''Fight Club'' was originally slated to be released in July 1999,<ref name="blood">{{cite journal | first=Benjamin | last=Svetkey | url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,271117,00.html| title=Blood, Sweat, and Fears | journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=October&nbsp;15, 1999 | accessdate=April&nbsp;30, 2008 }}</ref> later changed to August&nbsp;6, 1999.

Marketing executives at 20th Century Fox faced difficulties in marketing ''Fight Club'' and at one point considered marketing it as an [[art film]]. They considered that the film was primarily geared toward male audiences because of its violence and believed that not even Brad Pitt would attract female filmgoers. Research testing showed that the film appealed to teenagers. Fincher refused to let the posters and trailers focus on Pitt and encouraged the studio to hire the advertising firm [[Wieden+Kennedy]] to devise a marketing plan. The firm proposed a bar of pink soap with the title "Fight Club" embossed on it as the film's main marketing image; the proposal was considered "a bad joke" by Fox executives. Fincher also released two early trailers in the form of fake [[public service announcement]]s presented by Pitt and Norton; the studio did not think the trailers marketed the film appropriately. Instead, the studio financed a $20&nbsp;million large-scale campaign to provide a press junket, posters, billboards, and trailers for TV that highlighted the film's fight scenes. The studio advertised ''Fight Club'' on cable during [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] broadcasts, which Fincher protested, believing that the placement created the wrong context for the film.<ref name="mav4" /> Linson believed that the "ill-conceived one-dimensional" marketing by marketing executive Robert Harper largely contributed to ''Fight Club''{{'}}s lukewarm box office performance in the United States.<ref name="what">{{harvnb|Linson|2002|p=155}}</ref>

The [[British Board of Film Classification]] reviewed ''Fight Club'' for its November&nbsp;12, 1999 release in the United Kingdom and removed two scenes involving "an indulgence in the excitement of beating a (defenseless) man's face into a pulp". The board assigned the film an 18 certificate, limiting the release to adult-only audiences in the UK. The BBFC did not censor any further, considering and dismissing claims that ''Fight Club'' contained "dangerously instructive information" and could "encourage anti-social (behavior)". The board decided, "The film as a whole is<U+2014>quite clearly<U+2014>critical and sharply parodic of the amateur fascism which in part it portrays. Its central theme of male machismo (and the [[anti-social behaviour]] that flows from it) is emphatically rejected by the central character in the concluding reels."<ref>{{cite journal | first=Adam | last=Dawtrey | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117757863.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=UK to cut 'Club' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=November&nbsp;9, 1999 | accessdate=March&nbsp;23, 2007 }}</ref> The scenes were restored in a two-disc DVD edition released in the UK in March 2007.<ref>{{cite web | first=Philip | last=French | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2007/mar/04/3 | title=Fight Club | work=[[The Observer]] | date=March&nbsp;4, 2007 | accessdate=March&nbsp;30, 2007 }}</ref>

=== Home media ===
Fincher supervised the composition of the DVD packaging and was one of the first directors to participate in a film's transition to home media. The film was released in two DVD editions.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Scott | last=Kirsner | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117963617.html?categoryid=20&cs=1 | title=How DVDs became a success | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=April&nbsp;23, 2007 | accessdate=April&nbsp;28, 2007 }}</ref> The single-disc edition included a commentary track,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.foxstore.com/detail.php?item=105 | title=Fight Club | work=foxstore.com | publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] | accessdate=March&nbsp;23, 2007 }}</ref> while the two-disc special edition included the commentary track, behind-the-scenes clips, deleted scenes, trailers, fake public service announcements, the promotional music video "This is Your Life", Internet spots, still galleries, cast biographies, [[storyboard]]s, and publicity materials.<ref name="special">{{cite web | url=http://www.foxstore.com/detail.php?item=986 | title=Fight Club Special Edition | work = foxstore.com | publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] | accessdate=March&nbsp;23, 2007 }}</ref> The director worked on the DVD as a way to finish his vision for the film. Julie Markell, 20th Century Fox's senior vice president of creative development, said the DVD packaging complemented the director's vision: "The film is meant to make you question. The package, by extension, tries to reflect an experience that you must experience for yourself. The more you look at it, the more you'll get out of it." The studio developed the packaging for two months.<ref name=package>{{cite journal | first=Marla | last=Misek | title=For ''Fight Club'' and ''Seven'', package makes perfect | journal=EMedia Magazine | month=November | year=2001 | volume=14 | issue=11 | pages=27<U+2013>28 }}</ref> The two-disc special edition DVD was packaged to look covered in brown cardboard wrapper.

== Critical reception ==
When ''Fight Club'' premiered at the [[Venice International Film Festival]], the film was debated fiercely by critics. A newspaper reported, "Many loved and hated it in equal measures."

[[Janet Maslin]], reviewing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', praised Fincher's direction and editing of the film. She wrote that ''Fight Club'' carried a message of "contemporary manhood", and that, if not watched closely, the film could be misconstrued as an endorsement of violence and [[nihilism]].<ref name="maslin">{{cite news | first=Janet | last=Maslin | authorlink=Janet Maslin | url= http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/15/movies/film-review-such-a-very-long-way-from-duvets-to-danger.html | title=Film Review; Such a Very Long Way From Duvets to Danger | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=October&nbsp;15, 1999 |accessdate=April&nbsp;30, 2008 }}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]], reviewing for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', called ''Fight Club'' "visceral and hard-edged", and "a thrill ride masquerading as philosophy" that most audiences would not appreciate.<ref>{{cite news | first=Roger | last=Ebert | authorlink=Roger Ebert | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19991015/REVIEWS/910150302/1023 | title= Fight Club | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=October&nbsp;15, 1999 | accessdate=March&nbsp;23, 2007 }}</ref> Ebert later acknowledged that the film was "beloved by most, not by me".<ref>{{cite news | first=Roger | last=Ebert | authorlink=Roger Ebert | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070823/REVIEWS/708230308/-1/REVIEWS01 | title=Zodiac | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=August&nbsp;24, 2007 | accessdate=April&nbsp;30, 2008 }}</ref> Jay Carr of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' opined that the film began with an "invigoratingly nervy and imaginative buzz", but that it eventually became "explosively silly".<ref>{{cite news | first=Jay | last=Carr | url= | title='Fight Club' packs a punch but lacks stamina | work=[[Boston Globe]] | date=October&nbsp;15, 1999 }}</ref> ''[[Newsweek]]''{{'}}s David Ansen described ''Fight Club'' as "an outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload" and thought that the ending was too pretentious.<ref>{{cite journal | first=David | last=Ansen | url= | title=A Fistful of Darkness | journal=[[Newsweek]] | date=October&nbsp;18, 1999 }}</ref> Richard Schickel of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the director's [[mise en sc<U+00E8>ne]] as dark and damp: "It enforces the contrast between the sterilities of his characters' aboveground life and their underground one.

Schickel applauded the performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, but he criticized the film's "conventionally gimmicky" unfolding and the failure to make Helena Bonham Carter's character interesting.<ref name=time>{{cite journal | first=Richard | last=Schickel | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,992235,00.html | title=Conditional Knockout | journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=October&nbsp;11, 1999 | accessdate=January&nbsp;7, 2008 }}</ref>

''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]''{{'}}s Gary Crowdus reviewed the critical reception in retrospect: "Many critics praised ''Fight Club'', hailing it as one of the most exciting, original, and thought-provoking films of the year." He wrote of the negative opinion, "While ''Fight Club'' had numerous critical champions, the film's critical attackers were far more vocal, a negative chorus which became hysterical about what they felt to be the excessively graphic scenes of fisticuffs&nbsp;... They felt such scenes served only as a mindless glamorization of brutality, a morally irresponsible portrayal, which they feared might encourage impressionable young male viewers to set up their own real-life fight clubs in order to beat each other senseless."<ref>{{cite journal | last=Crowdus | first=Gary | title=Getting Exercised Over ''Fight Club'' | journal=[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]] | year=2000 | month=September | volume=25 | issue=4 | pages=pp. 46<U+2013>48 }}</ref>
