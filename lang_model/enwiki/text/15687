'''Julia O'Hara Stiles''' (born [[March 28]], [[1981]]) is an [[United States|American]] stage and [[film|screen]] [[actor|actress]]. After beginning her [[theatre|theater]] career in small parts in a [[New York City]] theatre troupe, she has moved on to leading roles in plays by writers as diverse as [[William Shakespeare]] and [[David Mamet]]; her film career has included both commercial and critical successes, ranging from teen [[romantic comedy|romantic comedies]] such as ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]'' (1999) to dark [[art film|art house pictures]] such as ''[[The Business of Strangers]]'' (2001). When Stiles is not acting, she actively supports a variety of progressive causes.

==Early life==
Stiles was born in [[New York City]] to John O'Hara, an [[Irish American]] teacher and businessman, and Judith Stiles, a [[pottery|potter]] of [[English people|English]] and [[Italian American|Italian]] ancestry. She has two younger siblings - Jane and Johnny.  Stiles was raised in [[SoHo]] by liberal, lapsed [[Catholic]] parents. She started acting at age eleven, performing with New York's La MaMa Theatre Company and securing work by submitting photographs of herself in costume to the company and asking that she be kept in mind for juvenile roles.<ref>[http://www.juliastiles.net/theater.html JulaStile.net - Theatre]</ref>

==Career==
===Television career===
Stiles began her acting career in [[television]] roles.  After two appearances as the computer punk "Erica" on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series ''[[Ghostwriter (television series)|Ghostwriter]]'' in 1993 and 1994, she appeared as a guest star on the medical drama ''[[Chicago Hope]]''. She has been seen in two [[made-for-TV movie|made-for-TV movies]]: in ''Before Women Had Wings'' (1997) on [[CBS]], she played opposite [[Ellen Burstyn]] and [[Oprah Winfrey]] in an adaptation of the novel by Connie May Fowler; and she played a teenage girl who finds herself [[pregnant]] and runs away from her unforgiving father ([[Bill Smitrovich]]) in [[NBC]]'s miniseries ''The '60's'' (1999), a film Caryn James of ''The New York Times'' dismissed as "conspicuously idiotic." Stiles was the public face of the film, with NBC using her face, painted with a [[peace symbol|peace sign]] and the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]], both in its advertising and on the cover of the soundtrack album.

===Film career===
[[Image:JuliaStilesWicked.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Stiles' first lead role was in ''Wicked'' (1998)]]
Stiles' first film was a non-speaking part in ''I Love You, I Love You Not'' ([[1996 in film|1996]]), with [[Claire Danes]] and [[Jude Law]].  She also had small roles as [[Harrison Ford]]'s daughter in [[Alan J. Pakula]]'s ''[[The Devil's Own]]'' ([[1997 in film|1997]]) and in [[M. Night Shyamalan]]'s ''[[Wide Awake]]'' ([[1998 in film|1998]]).  Her first lead was in ''Wicked'' (1998), playing a teenage girl who murders her mother so she can have her father all to herself.  Critic Joe Balthai wrote she was "the darling of the 1998 [[Sundance Film Festival]]" and Internet movie writer [[Harry Knowles]] said she was the "discovery of the fest," but the film was not commercially released in the [[U.S.]] and went [[direct-to-video]] in 2001, after Stiles had become better known.

The role that gained Stiles renown was Kat Stratford, opposite [[Heath Ledger]], in Gil Junger's ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]'' ([[1999 in film|1999]]), an adaptation of ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' set in a [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] high school.  She won an [[MTV Movie Award]] for "Breakthrough Female Performance" for the role, and the Chicago Film Critics voted her the most promising new actress of the year.  Foreign critics applauded her work as well, including Adina Hoffman, who praised her as "a young, serious looking [[Diane Lane]]" and Martin Hoyle, who commented that Stiles played Kat "with bloody-minded independent charm from the beginning with hints of wistfulness beneath the determination."

Her next starring role was in ''[[Down to You]]'' ([[2000 in film|2000]]), which was heavily panned by critics, but earned Stiles and her co-star [[Freddie Prinze, Jr.]] a ''Teen Choice Award'' nomination for their on-screen chemistry. She subsequently appeared in two more [[Shakespeare]]an adaptations. The first was as the [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]] in Michael Almerayda's ''[[Hamlet (2000 film)|Hamlet]]'' (2000), with [[Ethan Hawke]] in the lead. The second was in the [[Desdemona (Othello)|Desdemona]] role, opposite [[Mekhi Phifer]] in [[Tim Blake Nelson]]'s ''[[O (film)|O]]'' ([[2001 in film|2001]]), a version of ''[[Othello]]'' set in a private boarding school. Neither film was a great success; ''O'' had been subjected to many delays and a change of distributors and ''Hamlet'' was an art house film shot on a minimal budget.

Stiles' next commercial success was in ''[[Save the Last Dance]]'' (2001), as an aspiring [[ballet|ballerina]] forced to leave her small town in downstate [[Illinois]] to live with her struggling musician father in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], after her mother is killed.  At her new, nearly all-black school, she falls in love with the character played by [[Sean Patrick Thomas]], who teaches her [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] dance steps that get her into [[The Juilliard School]].  The role won her two more MTV awards for "Best Kiss" and "Best Female Performance", and a ''Teen Choice Award'' for best fight scene, for her battle with [[Bianca Lawson]].  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' pronounced her "the coolest co-ed", putting her on the cover of its [[April 12]], [[2001]] issue.  She told ''Rolling Stone'' that she performed all her own dancing in the film, though the way the film was shot and edited might have made it appear otherwise.

[[Image:MattDamonJuliaStilesBourneSupremacy.jpg|right|thumb||250px|With [[Matt Damon]] in ''The Bourne Supremacy'' (2004)]]
In David Mamet's ''[[State and Main]]'' (2000), about a film shooting on location in a small town in [[Vermont]], she played a teenage girl who seduces a film actor ([[Alec Baldwin]]) with [[ephebophilia|a weakness for young girls]].  Stiles also played opposite [[Stockard Channing]] in the dark art house film ''[[The Business of Strangers]]'' (2001) as a conniving, amoral secretary who exacts [[revenge]] on her cold boss.  Channing was impressed by her co-star: "In addition to her talent, she has a quality that is almost feral, something that can make people uneasy.  She has an effect on people."  Stiles also had small roles as a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative in ''[[The Bourne Identity (film)|The Bourne Identity]]'' ([[2002 in film|2002]]) and its sequel ''[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|The Bourne Supremacy]]'' ([[2004 in film|2004]]).  Producer Lynda Obst was quoted as saying that Stiles was "turning into the next [[Meryl Streep]]". 

Her next film role was in ''[[Mona Lisa Smile]]'' ([[2003 in film|2003]]) as Joan, a student at [[Wellesley College]] in 1953, whose art professor ([[Julia Roberts]]) encourages her to pursue a career in [[law]] rather than becoming a wife and mother.  Critic Stephen Holden referred to her as one of cinema's "brightest young stars," but the film met with generally unfavorable reviews.

Stiles played a [[Wisconsin]] college student who is swept off her feet by a [[Denmark|Danish]] prince in ''[[The Prince and Me]]'' ([[2004 in film|2004]]), directed by [[Martha Coolidge]].  Stiles told an interview that she was very similar to the character, Paige Morgan, but critic Scott Foundas said while she was, as always, "irrepressibly engaging" the film was a "strange career choice for Stiles". This echoed criticism in reviews of ''[[A Guy Thing]]'' (2003), a romantic comedy with [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] and [[Selma Blair]]; critic Dennis Harvey wrote that Stiles was "wasted," and Stephen Holden called her "a serious actress from whom comedy does not seem to flow naturally".

In [[2005 in film|2005]], Stiles was cast opposite [[Liev Schreiber]] in ''[[The Omen (2006 film)|The Omen]]'', a remake of the [[The Omen|1976 horror film]]. The film was released on [[June 6]], 2006. She will also be reprising her role as Nicky in ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'', alongside [[Matt Damon]]. The role will be much larger than in the previous films, as Stiles' character will be Damon's love interest. Filming will start on [[August 1]] [[2006]], for a 2007 release.

===Stage Career===
Stile's first theatrical roles were in works by author/composer [[John Moran]] with the group [[Ridge Theater]], in Manhattan's lower East side from 1993-1998.  She later performed on stage in [[Eve Ensler]]'s ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'', in the summer of 2002, and appeared as Viola, the lead role in [[Shakespeare in the Park]]'s production of ''[[Twelfth Night (play)|Twelfth Night]]'' with [[Jimmy Smits]].  Reviewing the production, Ben Brantley of ''[[The New York Times]]'' saluted Stiles as "the thinking teenagers' movie goddess" who put him in mind of a "young [[Jane Fonda]]".

In the spring of 2004, she made her [[West End of London|London]] stage debut opposite [[Aaron Eckhart]] in a revival of [[David Mamet]]'s play ''[[Oleanna (play)|Oleanna]]'' at the [[Garrick Theatre]].

===Other work===
On [[March 17]] [[2001]],  Stiles hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and eight days later introduced a music nominee at the [[73rd Academy Awards]]. She returned to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on [[May 5]] in a [[cameo role|cameo]] as President [[George W. Bush]]'s daughter [[Jenna Bush]] in a skit that poked fun at the two first daughters being arrested for underage drinking.  [[MTV]] profiled her in its ''Diary'' series in 2003, and she was "''[[Punk'd]]''" by [[Ashton Kutcher]] at a [[Washington DC]] museum in the spring of 2004.

==Personal life==
Stiles attended Friends Seminary, a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] prep school in [[Manhattan]], and graduated from the [[Professional Children's School]] in New York in 1999. She then was an [[English literature|English]] major at [[Columbia University]], though she had several times interrupted her studies to pursue her career. During her first year (2000-2001), Stiles caused a minor uproar on campus when she mocked cafeteria workers in Columbia's dining halls while appearing on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''. Stiles later apologized for her comments in the campus newspaper, the ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]''. She graduated in May 2005, five years after entering.  

Stiles is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who supported [[John Kerry]]'s candidacy for [[President of the United States]],<ref>[http://www.juliastiles.net/news.html# GOING UPRIVER - A Letter From Julia]. JuliaStiles.net. 26 October 2004.</ref> and her official site, which her mother helps to maintain, provides a link to [[MoveOn|Moveon.org]].

Stiles has also worked for [[Habitat for Humanity]], building housing in [[Costa Rica]]<ref>[http://www.habitat.org/newsroom/2000archive/1insitedoc004229.htm]</ref>, and has worked with [[Amnesty International]] to try to raise awareness of the harsh conditions of immigration detention of unaccompanied juveniles; ''[[Marie Claire]]'' magazine, in January 2004, featured Stiles' trip to see conditions at the [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]] Youth Center in [[Leesport, Pennsylvania]]<ref>[http://www.amnestyusa.org/artistsforamnesty/feb2004.html Julia Stiles visits children in detention]. Amnesty International. Retrieved 27 February 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.amnestyusa.org/artistsforamnesty/july2004.html On the Front Lines]. Amnesty International. Retrieved 27 February 2006.</ref>. Additionally, Stiles serves on the Board of Directors of [http://www.amend.org Amend.org], a New York-based nonprofit that implements childhood injury prevention programs in [[Africa]].

Stiles is also an ex-[[vegan]]. When interviewed by [[Conan O'Brien]], she said the word "[[orgasm]]" came to mind when she had her first cheeseburger after giving up veganism. The actress has described herself as a [[feminism|feminist]] and wrote on the subject in ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>Julia Stiles. [http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,4120,1240843,00.html Who's afraid of the 1950s?] The Guardian. 17 June 2004. Retrieved 27 February 2006.</ref>  Stiles told ''[[Gotham Magazine]]'' in 2005 that "I'd never be in ''[[Playboy]]'' or anything close to that, not that anyone would ask" and in fact hates being photographed.

Stiles has dated actors [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] (in 1999) and [[Joshua Jackson]] (in 2000).  She is also a fan of the rock band [[Phish]].

Julia is also an avid baseball fan. Her favorite team is the [[Celebrity Mets Fans|New York Mets]]
