{{Template:Cannon}}
'''[[Cannon]]''' are large tubular [[firearm]]s designed to fire a heavy [[projectile]] over a long distance. They were first used in China and Europe, and were the archetypical form of [[artillery]]. The first cannon in Europe probably appeared in Moorish and Christian Spain. [[English cannon]] were first used during the [[Hundred Years War]], when primitive cannon were used at the [[Battle of Cr<U+00E9>cy]] in [[1346]].

The [[Old French]] word "cannon" was derived from [[Italian language|Old Italian]] ''cannone'', ultimately from [[Latin]] ''canna''&mdash;a tube.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/61/5/C0070500.html American Heritage Dictionary]</ref> The Latinised word ''canon'' was used for a gun since 1326 in Italy, and 1418 in England. ''Bombardum'', or "bombard", was earliest used for "cannon", but from 1430 it came to refer only to the largest weapons.<ref name="Nitrates">[http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/cannon.htm Cannons and Gunpowder]</ref>

The end of the [[Middle Ages]] saw the construction of larger and more powerful cannon, and their spread in warfare throughout the world. Forts featuring [[Artillery battery|cannon batteries]] were built during and after the [[Renaissance]], such as the [[trace italienne]] of [[Italy]], [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]]s' [[Device Forts]] in England and [[Vauban]]'s [[Star fort]]s in France.

The [[Age of Discovery]] brought cannon to the Americas, with European colonies and navies vying for supremacy. East Asia saw the construction of some of the world's largest cannon, such as the [[India]]n [[Jaivana cannon]]. The "giant gun" trend was by then disappearing in Europe, in favor of lighter, more manoeuvrable pieces in larger numbers, and the early use of true field artillery. [[Cannon operation]] during the [[18th century]] required as many as a dozen men, including two gunners, while during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] five gunners were used.

In modern military use, '''cannon''' generally refers to a high velocity, low trajectory, direct fire weapon, such as the main gun on most modern main battle [[tank]]s. The United States has also experimented with the use of cannon in modern warfare, such as with [[MGM-51 Shillelagh]], the [[Super High Altitude Research Project]], and [[Operation Upshot-Knothole]].

==Early history==

[[Ctesibius of Alexandria]] invented a primitive form of a cannon, operated by compressed air, before 200 BC.<ref>[http://www.tmth.edu.gr/en/aet/1/31.html Ctesibius of Alexandria]</ref>

Like firearms, cannon are a descendant of the [[fire-lance]],<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Needham|1986|pp=263<U+2013>275}}</ref> a gunpowder-filled tube attached to the end of a spear and used as a flamethrower; shrapnel was sometimes placed in the barrel so that it would fly out together with the flames.<ref name=crosby>{{Harvcolnb|Crosby|2002|p=99}}</ref> The earliest depiction of a gunpowder weapon is the illustration of a [[fire-lance]] on a mid-10th century silk banner from [[Dunhuang]].<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Needham|1986|pp=8<U+2013>9}}</ref> The ''T<U+00EA>-An Shou Chh<U+00EA>ng Lu'' records that [[Song Dynasty|Song]] forces used fire-lances against the [[Jurchens]] at the siege of De'an in 1132.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Needham|1986|p=222}}</ref> January 28 of that same year saw the first documented battlefield use of artillery with gunpowder propellant when [[Song Dynasty|Song]] General [[Han Shizhong]] used [[escalade]] and [[Huochong]] to capture a city in [[Fujian]].

{{Harvtxt|Needham|1986}} suggests that the proto-[[Shell (projectile)|shell]]s described in the ''[[Huolongjing]]'' may be among the first of their kind. In the year 1161 the Song Dynasty navy employed [[trebuchet]] catapults to launch gunpowder bombs against the opposing Jin Dynasty navy on the Yangtze River.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 476">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 476.</ref> In [[1221]], cast iron bombs thrown by hand, [[sling (weapon)|sling]], and catapult are mentioned.

Eventually, the paper and bamboo of which fire-lance barrels were originally made came to be replaced by metal.<ref name=chase/> The earliest depiction of a gun is a sculpture from a cave in Sichuan dating to the 1100s of a figure carrying a vase-shaped [[bombard]] with flames and a cannonball coming out of it.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Lu|Needham|Phan|1988}}</ref><ref name=chase>{{Harvcolnb|Chase|2003|pp=31-32}}</ref> The oldest surviving gun, dated to 1288, has a muzzle bore diameter of 2.5 cm; the second oldest, dated to 1332, has a muzzle bore diameter of 10.5 cm.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Needham|1986|p=290}}</ref>

In his 1341 poem 'The Iron Cannon Affair', one of the first accounts of the use of gunpowder artillery in China, Zhang Xian wrote that a cannonball fired from an eruptor could 'pierce the heart or belly when it strikes a man or horse, and can even transfix several persons at once'.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Norris|2003|p=11}}</ref>

During wartime, the Chinese used the early gunpowder weapons in defence against the [[Mongols]], mounting more than 3,000 bronze and iron casted cannons on the [[Great Wall of China]]. The weapon was taken up by the Mongol conquerors later, and was also used in [[Korean cannon|Korea]]. An account of a 1359 battle near Hangzhou records that both the Ming Chinese and Mongol sides were equipped with cannon.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kelly|2004|p=17}}</ref>

==Medieval Europe and the Middle East==
{{main|Cannon in the Middle Ages}}
[[Image:Cannoniere_1652.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The parts of a cannon described, John Roberts, ''The Compleat Cannoniere'', London 1652.]]
The first mention of the composition of gunpowder in express terms in Europe appeared in [[1216]], in [[Roger Bacon]]'s "''De nullitate magi<U+00E6>''" at Oxford.<ref>{{cite book 
 |title=Encyclopedia Britannica
 |year=1771
 |location=London
 |chapter=Gunpowder
 |quote = <!-- original uses Long s  --> frier Bacon, our countryman, mentions the compo<U+017F>ition in expre<U+017F>s terms, in his treati<U+017F>e ''De nullitate magi<U+00E6>'', publi<U+017F>hed at Oxford, in the year 1216.
}}; Note the [[Long s]]</ref>  Later in [[1248]], his "''Opus Maior''" describes a recipe and recognized military use:
{{long quotation|"We can, with saltpeter and other substances, compose artificially a fire that can be launched over long distances... By only using a very small quantity of this material much light can be created accompanied by a horrible fracas. It is possible with it to destroy a town or an army ... In order to produce this artificial lightning and thunder it is necessary to take saltpeter, sulfur, and Luru Vopo Vir Can Utriet".}}

Bacon described firecrackers, "used in certain parts of the world". Bacon's mixture resembles the assumed composition of Chinese slow-burning powder as used in fire arrows and rockets, but will probably not function well as cannon gunpowder - the saltpeter content is too low. Gunpowder was first used in Spain by Moorish cannon at the siege of [[Seville]] in [[1248]], and the siege of [[Niebla, Huelva|Niebla]] in 1262.<ref name="ArabRockets">[http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%203.htm Gunpowder Composition for Rockets and Cannon in Arabic Military Treatises In Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries]</ref> By 1260, "coal and sulphur" had been recognised as the best weapon for [[naval warfare|ship-to-ship combat]],<ref>[http://www.mediumaevum.com/75years/mirror/sec2.html#XXXIX King's Mirror, Chapter XXXVII: The duties, activities and amusements of the Royal Guardsmen]</ref> while hand guns were probably in use at this time, such as against the [[Mongols]], and Italian ''scopettieri'' ("gun bearers") were mentioned in conjunction with crossbowmen in [[1281]]. The Spanish historian [[Jeronimo Zurita y Castro|Zurita]] recorded cannon at the  siege of [[Alicante]] in [[1331]],<ref>Partington,  J. R., A History of Greek Fire and Gunpowder, reprint by Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 191 (Latin text of Zurita)</ref><ref name="ArabRockets"/> and by [[1340]], light cannon were widespread enough in the Islamic world to end up in military inventories. The Spanish Kings enlisted "the first artillery-masters on the Peninsula" in the mid-14th century.<ref>Ada Bruhn de Hoffmeyer, ''Arms and Amour in Spain'', p. 217.</ref>

[[Image:Arrow fireing cannon1.jpg|thumb|right|A reconstruction of the vase cannon that fired arrows.]]
[[Juan de Mariana]] recalled further use of cannon during the capture of [[Algeciras]] in [[1342]], and also related that the English Earl of [[Derby]] and Earl of [[Salisbury]] had both participated in the siege.<ref>Mariana,.Juan de, Historia general de Espana, 2 volumes,  Madrid, 1608, ii, 27; English tr. by Capt. John Stephens, The General History of Spain, 2 parts., London, 1699. Part one, p.2 64.</ref><ref name="ArabRockets"/> They could have conceivably transferred the knowledge about the effectiveness of cannon to England.<ref>Watson, R., Chemical Essays, vol. I, London,1787, 1999. p.331</ref> Cannon certainly saw its first real use on the European battlefield during the [[Hundred Years War]], being only used in small numbers by a few states during the 1340s. "Ribaldis" were first mentioned in the English Privy Wardrobe accounts during preparations for the [[Battle of Cr<U+00E9>cy]] between 1345 and 1346.<ref name="Nicolle21">Nicolle, p 21</ref> These were believed to have shot large arrows and simplistic grapeshot, but they were so important they were directly controlled by the Royal Wardrobe.<ref name="Nicolle21"/> According to the contemporary [[Jean Froissart]], the English cannon made "two or three discharges on the [[Genoese]]", which is taken to mean individual shots by two or three guns because of the time taken to reload such primitive artillery.<ref name="Nicolle">Nicolle</ref> The Florentine [[Giovanni Villani]] recounts their destructiveness on the field, indicating that by the end of the battle, "the whole plain was covered by men struck down by arrows and cannon balls."<ref name="Nicolle65">Nicolle, p 65</ref>

Similar cannon appeared also at the [[Siege of Calais]] in the same year, although it would not be until the 1380s that the "ribaudekin" clearly became mounted on wheels.<ref name="Nicolle21"/> Around the same period, the [[Byzantine Empire]] began to accumulate its own cannon to face the [[Ottoman]] threat, starting with medium-sized cannon 3 feet long and of 10" calibre.<ref name="Constantinople39">Turnbull, p 39-41</ref> The first definite use of artillery in the region was against the Ottoman siege of [[Constantinople]] in [[1396]], as the attackers did not yet have any gunpowder of their own. These loud Byzantine weapons, possibly operated by the Genoese or "[[Franks]]" of [[Galata]], forced the Turks to withdraw.<ref name="Constantinople39"/>
[[Image:Dardanelles Gun Turkish Bronze 15c.png|thumb|250px|left|The [[Great Turkish Bombard|Dardanelles Gun]], used by the Turks at Constantinople.]] 
The Turks acquired their own cannon by the siege of [[1422]], using "[[Falconet (cannon)|falcons]]", which were short but wide cannon. The two sides were evenly matched technologically, and contemporary sources credit the lifting of the siege to an apparition of the Theotokos upon the city walls.<ref name="Constantinople39"/> Pius II promoted the affordable donation of cannon by European monarchs as a means of aid to the Empire, which was facing economic problems at the time, but aside from these no other advances were made to the Byzantine arsenal.<ref name="Constantinople39"/> The Turks, on the other hand, saw that they needed heavy cannon to breach the [[Walls of Constantinople]], using 68 Hungarian-made cannon in 1453. The largest required an operating crew of 200 men,<ref name="Trivia Library">[http://www.trivia-library.com/b/military-and-war-weapons-the-cannon.htm Military and War Weapons the Cannon]</ref> and 70 oxen and 10,000 men just to transport them.<ref name="Constantinople39"/> They were extremely loud, adding to their psychological impact, and the 55-day bombardment of [[Constantinople]] left massive destruction; the Greek chronicler Kritovoulos recorded that cannonballs "hit the wall, which it immediately shook and knocked down and was itself broken into many fragments and scattered, hurling the pieces everywhere and killing those who happened to be nearby."<ref name="Constantinople39"/>

Byzantine counter artillery allowed them to repel any visible Turkish weapons, and the defenders repulsed any attempts to storm any broken points in the walls and hastily repaired any damage. However, the walls could not be adapted for artillery, and there was even worry that the largest Byzantine cannon could cause more damage to their own walls than the Turkish cannon.<ref name="Constantinople39"/> Gunpowder had also made the formerly devastating [[Greek fire]] obsolete, and with the final fall of what had once been the strongest walls in Europe on [[May 29]], "it was the [[Late Middle Ages|end of an era]] in more ways than one".<ref name="Constantinople43">Turnbull, p 43</ref>

==Post-Medieval Use==
[[Image:Tsar-Pushka.jpg|thumb|left|[[1586]] [[Tsar Cannon]], the largest [[howitzer]] ever made, by [[Andrey Chokhov]].]]
{{see also|Trace italienne|Star fort||}}
The end of the Middle Ages saw the construction of larger and more powerful cannon, and their spread in warfare throughout the world. The ''[[Tsar Cannon|Tsar Pushka]]'' (''<U+0426><U+0430><U+0440><U+044C>-<U+043F><U+0443><U+0448><U+043A><U+0430>'' in [[Russian language|Russian]], literally "[[Tsar]]-cannon"), [[foundry|founded]] by Russian founding master [[Andrey Chokhov]] in [[1586]], was the largest [[howitzer]] ever made. The cannon, which still survives today, was intended to fire [[grapeshot]] and to defend [[the Kremlin]], but was never used. In fact, with such a large cannon, it may have been intended as a showpiece of military might and engineering from the beginning.

Most notable in this period, however, is the effect of cannon on conventional fortifications. [[Niccol<U+00F2> Machiavelli]] wrote in ''[[The Art of War (Machiavelli)|The Art of War]]'': "There is no wall, whatever its thickness that artillery will not destroy in only a few days".  Although [[castle]]s were not immediatedly made obsolete by cannon, their importance declined.<ref name="Castles81">Wilkinson, p 81</ref> Instead of majestic [[tower]]s and [[merlon]]s, the walls of new fortresses were thicker and angulated, while towers became lower and stouter.<ref name="Castles81"/>
[[Image:Fortbourtange.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Vauban]]-style [[Star fort]], showing the influence of cannon on fort design.]]
Forts featuring [[Artillery battery|cannon batteries]] were built during the [[Renaissance]], such as the ''[[trace italienne]]'' of [[Italy]] and the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]]s' [[Device Forts]] in England.<ref name="Castles81"/> To guard against artillery and gunfire, increasing use was made of earthen, brick and stone [[Breastwork (fortification)|breastworks]] and [[redoubt]]s, such as the geometric "[[Star fort]]s" of the 17th century French [[Marquis de Vauban]]. These soon replaced castles in Europe, and eventually castles in the Americas were superseded by bastions and forts.<ref name="SpanishMain">Chartrand, ''Spanish Main 1492-1800''</ref>

Like castles, conventional siege artillery, such as [[siege tower]]s and trebuchets, became vulnerable and obsolete with the development of large cannon and changes in fortification. However, constructions known as "battery-towers" took on a similar role as siege towers in the [[gunpowder]] age. These were built out of wood on site and were used for concentrating siege cannon on a particular point in a fortification. One of these was built by the [[Russians|Russian]] [[military engineer]] [[Ivan Vyrodkov]] during the [[siege of Kazan]] in [[1552]] (as part of the [[Russo-Kazan Wars]]), and could hold ten large-calibre cannon and 50 lighter cannon.<ref name="Kazan">Nossov, p 53-55</ref>

==Cannon in East Asia==
[[Image:RajaGopalaCannon.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A 17th century forge-welded iron cannon, at [[Thanjavur]]'s eastern entrance.]]
East Asia also saw the construction of massive cannon. During [[Japanese invasions of Korea]],1592-1599, the Korean ([[Joseon dynasty]]) battleships equipped with many cannons played a critical role in stopping Japanese supply by defeating the Japanese navy. The Japanese had [[musket]], which was more effective than any other Korean individual firearm. But the superiority of Korean cannon enabled the Korean navy to defeat the invaders with a few casualties. 

The invention of [[gunpowder]] spread into [[India]] prior to the Mongol intrusion in China. In India, gunpowder was manufactured and used in both [[rocket]]ry and for powering cannon. Even before this however, the Indians used rudimentary projectile weapons to launch stones and explosive/incendiary objects at besieging armies. The [[Arthashastra]] mentions a tubular weapon, the Sataghni. Indigenous gunpowder was called ''agnicurna''. By the [[16th Century]], the world's largest and heaviest cannon were being cast in India. The best examples of this are the [[Jaivana cannon]] of [[Jaipur]], considered the largest wheel mounted cannon ever made, and the Thanjavur Cannon in [[Thanjavur]] armories in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. The "giant gun" trend was by then disappearing in Europe, in favor of lighter, more manoeuvrable pieces in larger numbers, and the early use of true field artillery.

==18th and 19th century==
{{main|Naval artillery in the Age of Sail|Field artillery in the American Civil War}}
[[Image:HMS Victory 68lb Carronade.png|thumb|left|68-pounder naval carronade.]]
The lower tier of 17th century English [[Ship of the Line|ships of the line]] were usually equipped with demi-cannon <U+2014> a [[navy|naval]] [[gun]] which fired a 32-pound solid shot. A full cannon at this time fired a 42-pound shot, but these were discontinued by the 18th century as they were seen as too unwieldy. By the end of the century, principles long adopted in Europe specified the characteristics of cannon of the British Ship design and the types and sizes of acceptable defects.  The U.S. Navy tested guns by measurement, proof by powder (two or three firings), and using compressed water for leak detection.<ref name="NavyBarbaryI">Knox, ''Naval Documents related to the United Stats Wars with the Barbary Powers'', Volume I</ref>

The [[carronade]] was adopted by the Royal Navy in 1779, and the lower muzzle velocity of the [[round shot]] was intended to create many more of the deadly wooden [[wikt:splinter|splinter]]s when hitting the structure of an enemy vessel. It was much shorter and a third to a quarter of the weight of an equivalent [[long gun]]: for example, a 32 pounder carronade weighed less than a [[ton]], but a 32 pounder long gun weighed over 3 tons. The guns were thus easier to handle and also required less than half the gunpowder of long guns mounted on naval garrison carriages, allowing fewer men to crew them.<ref>[http://www.hms.org.uk/nelsonsnavycarronade.htm The Historical Maritime Society]</ref> Carronades were manufactured in the usual naval gun [[calibre]]s<!--12, 18, 24, 32 and 42&nbsp;[[pound (weight)#Imperial_pound|pounders]], but 6&nbsp;pdr and 68&nbsp;pdr versions are known-->, but they were not counted in a [[ship of the line]]'s rated number of guns.  As a result, the classification of Royal Navy vessels in this period can mislead, since they would often be carrying more pieces of ordnance than were listed.

The Turkish cannons of the siege of Constantinople, after being on permanent display for four centuries, were used to battle a British fleet in [[1807]]. The artillery hit a British ship with two 700 pound cannonballs, killing 60 sailors. In 1867, Sultan Abdul Aziz gifted [[Queen Victoria]] the 17 ton "Dardanelles Gun" - one of the cannons used at the siege of Constantinople.<ref name="Trivia Library"/>
[[Image:Utah Battery San Juan Bridge.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|U.S. troops fire during [[1899]] [[Battle of Manila (1899)|Battle of Manila]].]]
But in contrast to this antiquited weapons, later western guns during the 19th century became massive, destructive, more accurate, and covered a very long range - such as the American 3 inch wrought-iron muzzle-loading [[howitzer]] used during the [[American Civil War]] with an effective range of over 1.83km. In the 1810s and 1820s, greater emphasis was placed on the accuracy of long-range gunfire, and less on the weight of a broadside. The carronade, although initially very successful and widely adopted, disappeared from the Royal Navy from the 1850s after the development of steel, jacketed cannon by [[William George Armstrong]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]]. Nevertheless, carronades were used in the [[American Civil War]] in the 1860s.

The superior cannon technology of Westerners in later years would bring them tremendous advantages in warfare. For example, in the [[Opium War]] in China during the 19th century, the British battleships bombarded the coastal areas and fortifications safe from the reach of the Chinese cannon. Similarly, the shortest war on the record, the [[Anglo-Zanzibar War]] of 1896, was brought to a swift conclusion by shelling from British battleships.<ref>Guinness Book of World Records, 2002 edition, p 112</ref>

==Modern cannon==
[[Image:British 39th Siege Battery RGA Somme 1916.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Royal Artillery]] [[Howitzer]]s at the [[First day on the Somme|Somme]].]]

A modern artillery piece is generally referred to either as a "gun", or by the name of its specific type, such as a [[Howitzer]]. "Cannon" generally refers to a high velocity, low trajectory, direct fire weapon, such as the main gun on most modern main battle [[tank]]s. Since [[World War II]], the term has been used to refer to a gun of around 20 mm to 125 mm calibre, sometimes with an automatic loading [[Firearm action|action]] capable of firing explosive [[ammunition]], an ''[[auto-cannon]]''. (A howitzer typically means a weapon using a lower velocity than a cannon, which fires on a higher trajectory, and provides indirect fire.)

The minimum calibre of a cannon, 20 mm, has been a ''[[de facto]]'' standard since World War II, when heavy machine guns of 12.7 mm (0.5 inches) and 13.2 mm calibre were used side by side with 20 mm and larger guns, the latter using explosive ammunition (''eg.'' [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] fighters with 20 mm Hispano cannon and [[Luftwaffe]] with 20 mm and [[30 mm caliber|30 mm]] cannon). The [[Bofors 40 mm gun]] and [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon]] are two examples largely used during World War II, and still in use today.
[[Image:5-54-Mark-45-firing edit.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An American 5-inch Mark 45 gun, immediately after the shell has left the barrel.]]
Most nations use these modern cannon on their lighter vehicles. Typical of the type is the [[25 mm caliber|25 mm]] [[M242|'Bushmaster']] [[chain gun]] mounted on the [[LAV 25|LAV]] and [[M2 Bradley|Bradley]] [[Infantry fighting vehicle|armoured vehicles]].<ref>[http://www.army-technology.com/projects/bradley/ Bradley M2 / M3 Tracked Armoured Fighting Vehicles, USA]</ref> At the same time, the guns used aboard the [[Iowa class battleship|Iowa class]] [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|USS ''Wisconsin'']] and [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] were capable of firing projectiles a distance of 39 km.<ref>Guinness Book of World Records, 2002 edition, p 184</ref>

Significant innovations have been made regarding the cannon's place in modern warfare. "[[Supergun]]s" have been developed since the early 20th century, and the 20 cm calibre "[[Paris Gun]]" of [[World War I]] had the greatest range of a gun, achieving 122 km.<ref>Guinness Book of World Records, 2002 edition, p 113</ref> Testing has also been carried out on [[Nuclear artillery|nuclear cannon]] in the [[1950s]], as in the [[United States]]' [[Operation Upshot-Knothole]]. Today, [[United States]] 152 mm artillery fires [[MGM-51 Shillelagh|Shillelagh missiles]], which are guided to their targets by [[infra-red]] beams, while the [[Super High Altitude Research Project]] artillery can fire shells 75.75 mi. above the earth's surface.<ref name="Trivia Library"/>
