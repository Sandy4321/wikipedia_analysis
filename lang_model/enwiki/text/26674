'''Pinkham Notch''' (elevation 2032 ft. / 619 m) is a [[mountain pass]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] of north-central [[New Hampshire]], [[United States]]. The notch is a result of extensive erosion by the [[Laurentide ice sheet]] during the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Wisconsinian ice age]]. Pinkham Notch was eroded into a glacial U-shaped valley whose walls are formed by the Presidential, Wildcat, and Carter-Moriah Ranges. Due to the volatility of the area's climate and rugged character of the terrain, a number of rare or endemic ecosystems have developed throughout the notch.

The notch was discovered in 1784 by Jeremy Belknap, but its isolation prevented further development for several years. The construction of [[New Hampshire Route 16]] has led to increased accessibility and a rise in tourism. Its location makes it a hub for hiking and skiing.

==Geography==
The notch separates the [[Presidential Range]], which forms the western wall, from the [[Wildcat Mountain (New Hampshire)|Wildcat Range]], which forms the eastern wall. Two rivers drain the notch; the [[Ellis River]] drains the south end and is a tributary of the [[Saco River|Saco]], and the [[Peabody River]] drains the north end and is a tributary of the [[Androscoggin River|Androscoggin]].<ref name="USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Map Series: Mount Washington, Stairs Mountain, Carter Dome, Jackson Quadrangles">USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Map Series: Mount Washington, Stairs Mountain, Carter Dome, Jackson Quadrangles.</ref>

[[Image:Mountwashingtonview.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Mount Washington, which forms the western wall of Pinkham Notch, holds several glacial cirques. From left to right are [[Tuckerman Ravine]], the Ravine of Raymond Cataract, and [[Huntington Ravine]].]]The bulk of the western slope of the notch is formed by [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]], the highest peak in the northeast United States, reaching 6,288&nbsp;ft (1,917&nbsp;m) above sea level.<ref>Daniell, Gene, and Smith, Steven D.

The [[Great Gulf]] and its tributary cirques form the largest cirque in the White Mountains.<ref name="Daniell and Smith 11">Daniell and Smith, p. 11.</ref> South of the Great Gulf is [[Huntington Ravine]], with a rocky, precipitous headwall renowned for its rock and ice climbing.<ref>Randall, Peter.

The eastern slope of the notch consists of the Wildcat and [[Carter-Moriah Range]]s, slightly lower than the Presidential Range to the west. The Wildcat Range consists of five peaks, named A, B, C, D, and E from northeast to southwest in order of height.<ref>Daniell and Smith, p. 384.</ref> Wildcat&nbsp;A is the highest, at 4,422&nbsp;feet (1,348&nbsp;m).<ref name="USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Map Series: Mount Washington, Stairs Mountain, Carter Dome, Jackson Quadrangles"/>  From the main ridge, the slopes drop very steeply, but not precipitously, to the floor of the notch. The [[Wildcat Mountain Ski Resort]] occupies the western slopes of Wildcat up to the [[Mountain pass|col]] between D and E&nbsp;peaks.<ref name="Wildcat Mountain">[http://www.skiwildcat.com/history.html] History of Wildcat Mountain Ski Resort. Wildcat Mountain. 2001. Retrieved 9 Sept 2006</ref> As the notch rounds E&nbsp;peak, the slope becomes extremely steep, and Wildcat Ridge begins to drop to the end of the notch.

The Carter-Moriah Range lies to the north of Wildcat Ridge, forming the eastern side of Pinkham Notch all the way to the Androscoggin River.<ref>Daniell and Smith, p. 384<U+2013>385.</ref>  From south to north, the peaks overlooking the notch are [[Carter Dome (New Hampshire)|Carter Dome]] (4,832&nbsp;ft / 1,473&nbsp;m), [[Mount Hight]] (4,675&nbsp;ft / 1,425&nbsp;m), [[South Carter Mountain]] (4,420&nbsp;ft / 1,347&nbsp;m), [[Middle Carter Mountain]] (4,600&nbsp;ft / 1,402&nbsp;m), [[North Carter Mountain]] (4,530&nbsp;ft / 1,381&nbsp;m), [[Imp Mountain]] (3,720&nbsp;ft / 1,134&nbsp;m), and [[Mount Moriah (New Hampshire)|Mount Moriah]] (4,049&nbsp;ft / 1,234&nbsp;m).<ref>Daniell and Smith, p. 385.</ref>

==Environment==
The climate, and as a result, the flora and fauna, of Pinkham Notch varies greatly with elevation. As elevations increase on the walls of the notch, climate and ecosystems change to those of increasingly northern occurrence. [[Biome]]s range from a low-elevation northern [[hardwood forest]] at the base of Mount Washington to alpine-arctic vegetation near the summit comparable to vegetation found at the latitude of [[Labrador]].<ref>Stier, Maggie and McAdow, Ron. ''Into the Mountains''. AMC Books, 1995. ISBN 1-878239-30-9. p. 240.</ref>

===Below 2500 ft. <U+2014> Northern hardwood forest===
[[Image:Mtwashingtonautoroadsrsteel.jpg|400px|thumb|right|The floor of Pinkham Notch, looking toward Mount Washington]]
The lowest elevations of Pinkham Notch are occupied by a northern [[hardwood]] forest. This forest type is primarily deciduous and consists mostly of [[sugar maple]], [[American beech]], and [[yellow birch]].<ref>Slack, Nancy G. and Bell, Alison W. ''Field Guide to the New England Alpine Summits''. AMC Books, 1995. ISBN 1-878239-38-4. pp. 19<U+2013>21.</ref> There is also a proliferation of understory and forest floor plants; common examples include [[sasparilla|wild sasparilla]], [[trillium|painted trillium]], [[viburnum|hobblebush]], and Indian cucumber-root.<ref>Slack and Bell, p. 20.</ref>

The northern hardwood forest also contains the greatest diversity of animal life in the notch.<ref name="Slack and Bell 21">Slack and Bell, p. 21.</ref> Mammals include [[chipmunks]], [[raccoons]], [[white-tailed deer]], [[American black bear|black bears]], and [[moose]].<ref name="Slack and Bell 21"/> There are also a large number of birds in this forest; frequently seen are red-eyed vireos, [[hermit thrush]]es, and [[ovenbird]]s.<ref name="Slack and Bell 21"/> Amphibians are also found in the northern hardwood forest. Red efts, the terrestrial stage of development for the [[Eastern Newt|red-spotted newt]], congregate in large numbers after heavy rains; also present are [[American toad]]s, [[spring peeper]]s, and [[Wood Frog|wood frogs]].<ref name="Slack and Bell 21"/>

At around 2000 ft (600 m), species from higher forest zones begin to mix with the northern hardwoods in what is known as the "transition zone". As elevation within this zone increases, species from the lower hardwood forest begin to drop out. By 2,500&nbsp;feet (750&nbsp;m), yellow birch is the only deciduous species that remains, and the forest becomes a spruce-fir forest.<ref>Slack and Bell, p. 15.</ref>

===2500 ft. to 4000 ft. <U+2014> Spruce/fir forest===
As elevation increases, the forest is subjected to colder temperatures, increased moisture, and acidic, infertile soils. As a result, conifers, or "[[softwood]]s" become the dominant species. Two trees, [[red spruce]] and [[balsam fir]], are present throughout this zone, with [[paper birch]], [[striped maple]] and [[mountain]] ash present in its lower levels.<ref name="Slack and Bell 22<U+2013>24">Slack and Bell, pp. 22<U+2013>24.</ref> Like the hardwood forest below it, the spruce-fir forest also holds understory plants; commonly found are [[wood sorrel]], [[Indian Pipe|Indian pipes]], [[Maianthemum canadense|Canada mayflowers]], and [[blue-bead lily|bluebead lilies]].<ref name="Slack and Bell 22<U+2013>24"/> Fungi are also common in the moist environment.

Most of the animals in the spruce-fir forest have ranges that extend into the balsam fir forest higher up.<ref name="Slack and Bell 24<U+2013>25">Slack and Bell 24<U+2013>25</ref> [[Warbler]]s are abundant; more than ten species exist in this forest type.<ref name="Slack and Bell 24<U+2013>25"/> Other common birds include [[boreal chickadee|brown-capped chickadees]], [[spruce grouse]], and yellow-capped woodpeckers. Mammals include the [[red squirrel]] and the [[pine marten]].<ref name="Slack and Bell 24<U+2013>25"/>

===4000 ft. to timberline <U+2014> Balsam fir forest===
As elevation continues to increase, only the hardiest trees remain in the forest, which is composed almost exclusively of balsam fir.<ref name="Slack and Bell 24-29">Slack and Bell, pp. 24<U+2013>29.</ref> Most of the understory plants and animals from the upper spruce-fir zone, however, can be found in this forest. Moisture causes nutrients to be stripped from the soil and brought to lower elevations, and decomposition takes place at a rate that is too slow to replenish them.<ref name="Slack and Bell 24-29"/>

In the upper reaches of the balsam fir zone, winds and temperatures are extreme enough to force the trees into stunted, "bonsai-like" shapes. Known as [[krummholz]], from the German word for "crooked wood", trees in this area are often bent into bizarre shapes by the combined effects of wind, temperature, and airborne ice particles.<ref name="Slack and Bell 24-29"/> Branches that are perpendicular to the prevailing winds are often killed, leaving "flag trees" that point in the direction of the wind.<ref name="Slack and Bell 24-29"/> Eventually, conditions become extreme enough to prevent any tree growth; the elevation at which this occurs is known as [[treeline]], and usually occurs at around 4,500&nbsp;ft (1,400&nbsp;m) in the White Mountains, depending on wind exposure.<ref>Monkman, Jerry and Monkman, Marcy. ''Discover the White Mountains of New Hampshire''. AMC Books, 2001. ISBN 1-878239-88-0</ref>

===Above timberline <U+2014> The alpine zone===
On the highest slopes of the west wall of the notch, trees are unable to grow, and an "alpine zone" of alpine-arctic vegetation exists.<ref name="Slack and Bell 30<U+2013>32">Slack and Bell, pp. 30<U+2013>32.</ref> Vegetation in this zone tends to be [[lichen]]s, sedges or small, low-lying plants that can resist the constant exposure to the wind. Most plants in this area are perennial; the growing season is far too short to allow for annuals. 

Alpine plants usually occur in communities spaced between barren [[scree|talus]] slopes. Cushion-shaped [[diapensia]] usually grows in communities in the windiest areas, and in less exposed sites [[sedge]], [[Ericaceae|heath]], snowbank, and alpine bog communities can be found.<ref> Slack and Bell, pp. 69<U+2013>78.</ref>

==History==
Pinkham Notch was originally a riverine, "V-shaped" valley until the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] shaped it into its current form, a "U-shaped" valley.<ref>Randall, p. 115.</ref> This shaping occurred during the [[Wisconsin Glaciation|Wisconsinian Ice Age]], 25<U+2013>50,000 years ago.<ref>Alden, Peter and Cassie, Brian ''National Audubon Society Field Guide to New England''. Chanticlear Press, 1998. ISBN 0-679-44676-1. pp 18<U+2013>19.</ref> The geology of the region became greatly altered by this event; much of the weaker rock was stripped from the region, leaving only highly-resistant mica [[schist]].<ref>Randall, p. 115.</ref> As the [[glacier]]s retreated, a layer of glacial till was deposited, including several glacial erratics.<ref>Randall, pp. 115<U+2013>116.</ref> A notable glacial erratic in the area is Mount Washington's Glen Boulder.<ref>Daniell and Smith 29</ref>

[[Image:Pinkhamgerry.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Artist Samuel Lancaster Gerry's 1877 depiction of Pinkham Notch, entitled "Tuckerman Ravine and Lion's Head".]]The notch first appears in recorded history in 1784, when an expedition led by [[Jeremy Belknap]] camped in the notch before ascending to the summit of Mount Washington through Huntington Ravine.<ref>Stier and McAdow, p. 248.</ref>. Pinkham Notch was far more isolated than neighboring [[Crawford Notch]]; as a result, the first settler of Pinkham Notch came in 1827, 43&nbsp;years after habitation of Crawford Notch.<ref name="Randall 9">Randall, p. 9.</ref> The first settler, Hayes Copp, built a homestead in the then-uninhabited area, near where the Dolly Copp campground stands today.<ref name="Randall 9"> Copp and his wife lived alone in the wilderness until Daniel Pinkham completed the first road through the notch between in 1836, finally providing a link between the Copp homestead and civilization.<ref name="Randall 9"/> In 1851, a railroad was built through Pinkham Notch to [[Gorham, New Hampshire|Gorham]], and a hotel, the Glen House, was constructed to accommodate passengers.<ref>Randall, p. 12.</ref> Mount Washington was the main attraction in the area; a bridle path was constructed from the Glen House to hotels on the summit, which was later improved into what would become the [[Mount Washington Auto Road]]. Completion of the road in 1861 led to a massive increase in tourism.<ref>Randall, p. 15.</ref>

Meanwhile, logging began in the Pinkham area. After almost total deforestation of the White Mountain region, the [[White Mountain National Forest]] was created in 1911, and the Mount Washington area was added to the national forest in 1914.<ref>Randall, p. 16.</ref> With the preservation of the area, emphasis shifted from logging to recreation. The [[Appalachian Mountain Club]] converted a logging camp near the [[water divide|height-of-land]] into what is now the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center in 1921.<ref>Randall, p. 142.</ref> The [[Appalachian Trail]] was built through the visitor center, making it an important trailhead for ascents of Mount Washington. Meanwhile, ski trails began to be constructed by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] on Wildcat Mountain, and the ski resort was opened in 1958.<ref name="Wildcat Mountain"/>

==Recreation==
Pinkham Notch is easily accessible by [[New Hampshire Route 16]].  Numerous opportunities for recreation exist in the area.

===Hiking===
[[Image:LostPond.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lost Pond in Pinkham Notch]]
[[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]] is a common objective, and is often climbed from Pinkham Notch. There are numerous trail approaches from the [[Appalachian Mountain Club]]'s visitor's center. Although trail distances seem short, the trip to the summit should not be underestimated; most trail approaches involve at least 4,000 vertical feet (1,200&nbsp;m) of climbing, including an ascent of the rocky summit cone and the boulder-strewn upper slopes.<ref>Daniell and Smith, p. 3.</ref> Weather changes very quickly, and one must be prepared for extreme conditions. The Tuckerman Ravine Trail is the most popular trail in the notch, ascending to the summit via the headwall of Tuckerman Ravine.<ref>Daniell and Smith, pp. 20<U+2013>21.</ref> The Huntington Ravine Trail is widely considered the most difficult trail in New Hampshire, making its way up the precipitous headwall of neighboring Huntington Ravine, where there are several rock climbing opportunities.<ref>Daniell and Smith, p. 24<U+2013>26.</ref>

On the other side of the notch, the Wildcat Range is a popular objective. The five summits can be reached via the Wildcat Ridge Trail; the first two miles are extremely difficult, and require skill on short, yet exposed, rock [[scrambling|scrambles]].<ref>Daniell and Smith, pp. 389<U+2013>391.</ref> This part of the trail is frequently bypassed by following the ski area's Polecat Trail to the summit of D&nbsp;Peak.<ref>Daniell and Smith, p. 390.</ref>

The [[Appalachian Trail]], which extends over 2,150&nbsp;miles (3,450&nbsp;km) from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to [[Maine]],<ref>The Appalachian Trail changes in length from year to year due to reroutes and other changes in the trail. An exact length is almost impossible to ascertain. For more information, see [http://www.outdoors.org/conservation/trails/at/at-faq.cfm] "Frequently Asked Questions Reveal Details on Thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail" ''Appalachian Mountain Club''. Accessed 2 October 2006.</ref> runs along the Presidential Range before crossing the notch and ascending to the summits of the Wildcat Range.<ref>Daniell and Smith, pp. 2 and 384.</ref>

There are also less challenging hikes that are equally scenic, yet better suited for families with young children. Popular objectives include Glen Ellis Falls, a waterfall on the Ellis River, and Square Ledge, with an impressive view of Mount Washington for modest effort.<ref>Daniell and Smith, pp. 11 and 432.</ref>

===Skiing===
[[Image:Pinkham.jpg|thumb|275px|The Wildcat Range, as seen from Tuckerman Ravine, forms the eastern slope of Pinkham Notch. A ski area operates on the range's northwestern face.]]The area also has many opportunities for both [[skiing|alpine]] and [[cross-country skiing|nordic]] skiing. The bowl of Tuckerman Ravine is famous for its extremely steep backcountry skiing.<ref>Randall, p. 131.</ref> Long lines are common during the peak spring-skiing season of April and May. Wildcat Mountain offers groomed ski trails and lifts, and is a better choice for less-experienced skiers. The centerpiece of the ski-area is the [[gondola lift|gondola]], which runs during the summer, and offers views of the Presidentials with no expended effort.<ref name="Wildcat Mountain"/>

For Nordic skiing, Great Glen Trails offers a large, groomed trail system that also includes the lower half of the Auto Road.<ref>Daniell and Smith, p. 6.</ref> Several warming huts are scattered around the trail system, including scenic Great Angel Cabin, with views of the Great Gulf and surrounding peaks.<ref>[http://www.greatglentrails.com] "Mountain Biking" Great Glen Trails Outdoor Center. Retrieved 29 September 2006.</ref> Great Glen also permits biking on the trails during the summer, and is the only mountain bike facility in the notch. Another cross-country trail system exists in the town of [[Jackson, New Hampshire|Jackson]], extending as far as the summit of Wildcat Mountain.<ref>[http://www.jacksonxc.org] "Jackson, New Hampshire: The Number 1 Cross-Country Ski Area in the Eastern United States" Jackson XC.
