==Pioneer family==

Holstead was descended from a pioneer [[Lincoln Parish, Louisiana|Lincoln Parish]] family. His paternal grandfather, '''John Burnham Holstead''', was born on December 18, 1849, in [[Bienville Parish, Louisiana|Bienville Parish]] and settled as a young man in [[Farmerville, Louisiana|Farmerville]], the seat of [[Union Parish, Louisiana|Union Parish]], where he became the editor of the [[newspaper]] ''Junior Record''. In 1874, he moved to the community of [[Vienna, Louisiana|Vienna]] in Lincoln Parish near Ruston to assume operations of ''The Vienna Sentinel''.<ref name=genea>{{cite web|url=http://74.125.45.132/search?q=cache:eVIj7R5RyuMJ:freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~halstead/lemuel/d1.html+George+B.+Holstead,+Jr.&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us|title=Descendants of Lemuel Holstead|publisher=freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=April 25, 2010}}</ref> He was married to the former Elizabeth T. Tanner (1868<U+2013>1934).  

Meanwhile, the self-educated John B. Holstead studied law independently by reading in the library of an attorney in Vienna. In 1878, at the age of twenty-nine, he was admitted to the practice of law. John B. and Elizabeth Holstead had two daughters, Kay (born 1878) and Bernice Holstead (born 1882). The family moved to Ruston in 1884, and two sons followed, Clyde B. Holstead (1886<U+2013>1937) and George B. Holstead, Sr. (January 12, 1895-1946). John Holstead had a successful law practice in Ruston, and in 1912, he was elected [[judge]] of the Fourth Judicial District and served until 1916. He was one of the founders of [[Louisiana Tech University]], established in 1894 as '''Louisiana Polytechnic Institute'''. Holstead died at his Ruston residence on December 13, 1933. George Holstead, Sr. (1895<U+2013>1946), married the former Lois Oliver (1895<U+2013>1993).<ref>Greenwood Cemetery records, Ruston, Louisiana</ref> In addition to George, Jr., the couple had an older son, James Oliver Holstead, who died in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]].<ref name=genea/>

==Holstead's early years==
George Holstead, Jr., attended Louisiana Tech for a year after high school and then enlisted in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] in the [[United States Army]]. He served in the [[United States Army Air Corps]], forerunner of the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], as part of the 63rd Bomb Squadron, [[Fifth Air Force]], with action in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations]]. He was also a [[general aviation]] [[aviator|pilot]] during much of his adult life. After military service, Holstead returned to Louisiana Tech, where he was an outstanding [[track and field]] athlete, having won the conference championship in the 100- and 220-yard dashes. He was an invited participant in the 1948 [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] trials held in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].<ref name=genea/>

Holstead obtained his law degree from the [[Louisiana State University Law Center]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]].<ref name=genea/>

==Legislative service==

Holstead's legislative tenure in District 12, which became a single-member district in 1972, corresponded with the administration of [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[John J. McKeithen]] and the first two of four nonconsecutive terms of [[Edwin Washington Edwards]]. Holstead succeeded [[L.D. "Buddy" Napper]], a Ruston attorney and a former semi-professional [[baseball]] player from Ruston, who had served from 1952-1964. In 1980, [[Joe Bleich]] of Ruston assumed the House seat, but he resigned in 1983<ref name=house/> to become an associate justice of the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]] from Place 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northlalaw.com/attorneys_joe.php|title=Joe Bleich|publisher=northlalaw.com|accessdate=April 25, 2010}}</ref>Bleich was unseated in 1996 by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] state district Court Judge [[Chet D. Traylor]] of [[Winnsboro, Louisiana|Winnsboro]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://electionresults.sos.louisiana.gov/graphical/|title=Louisiana primary election returns, September 21, 1996|publisher=electionresults.sos.louisiana.gov|accessdate=July 10, 2010}}</ref>

During his latter tenure, Holstead was the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. He was instrumental in obtaining state appropriations to foster the growth of his ''[[alma mater]]'', Louisiana Tech, and nearby [[historically black]] [[Grambling State University]] in [[Grambling, Louisiana|Grambling]] in Lincoln Parish.<ref name=genea/>
