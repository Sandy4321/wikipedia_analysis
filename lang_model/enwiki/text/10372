==Background==
{{further|Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egyptian constitutional referendum, 2011|Egyptian presidential election, 2012}}
Amid growing anger towards the regime, President [[Hosni Mubarak]], whose reign was marked by increasing corruption and authoritarianism, resigned on 11 February 2011 following [[Timeline of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011|18 days of mass protests]] that marked the beginning of a new era of political instability in Egypt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/11/hosni-mubarak-resigns-egypt-cairo|title=Hosni Mubarak resigns <U+2013> and Egypt celebrates a new dawn|date=February 11, 2011|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref> The subsequent transitional period, which saw the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]] (SCAF) taking power under Field Marshal [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]] immediately after Mubarak's ouster, saw [[Timeline of the 2011<U+2013>12 Egyptian civil unrest under the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces|renewed deadly clashes]] and [[Human rights in Egypt under the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces|human rights abuses]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/26220.aspx|title=SCAF: A brief history of injustice|date=November 10, 2011|publisher=Al-Ahram}}</ref> A round of elections started to take place in the country starting with the [[Egyptian constitutional referendum, 2011|2011 referendum]], in which a majority approved of reforms drafted by a [[Egyptian constitutional review committee of 2011|military-formed committee]]. The election however proved to be highly controversial despite some positive reforms such limiting the president's time in office to two four-year terms. Many opposition figures and activists were upset with the reforms as they were drafted in just ten days and were offered to the public for only three weeks before the referendum. Leading figures such as [[Amr Moussa]] and [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] wanted a new constitution to be drawn up from scratch before any elections are held, which would have occurred in case of a "no" vote. However, two of the country's largest political forces back then, the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and remnants of the former [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party]], have endorsed the reforms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12763313|title=Q&A: Egypt's constitutional referendum|date=March 17, 2011|publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/12/egypt-a-constitution-first|title=Egypt: a constitution first|date=June 12, 2011|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref> This turnout proved highly beneficial for the Brotherhood in the following months as they achieved nearly all of their political ambitions including a majority win for the Islamist current in the [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2011<U+2013>12|2011<U+2013>12 parliamentary election]], during which the Brotherhood was accused by many opposition figures of making deals with the military while protesters [[November 2011 Cairo clashes|were being killed]] by security forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/31403/Egypt/Politics-/Details-emerge-about-a-SCAF-deal-with-parties-duri.aspx|title=Details emerge about a SCAF 'deal' with parties during Mohamed Mahmoud clashes |date=January 10, 2012|publisher=Al-Ahram}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amb-marc-ginsberg/unholy-alliance-egypts-mi_b_1109534.html|title=Unholy Alliance: Egypt's Military & The Muslim Brotherhood|date=November 23, 2011|publisher=The Huffington Post}}</ref> Their efforts culminated with [[Mohamed Morsi]] winning against [[Ahmed Shafik]] by 51.7% in the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/24/us-egypt-election-idUSBRE85G01U20120624|title=Islamist joy as Morsy elected Egypt president|date=June 24, 2012|publisher=Reuters}}</ref>

===Constituent Assembly of 2012===
{{main|Egyptian Constituent Assembly of 2012}}
In April, a couple of months prior to Morsi's inauguration, the Administrative Court suspended a constituent assembly previously appointed in March without giving any clear reasons for this decision and which the Brotherhood claimed was politically-motivated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17665048|title=Egypt court suspends constitutional assembly|date=April 10, 2012|publisher=BBC}}</ref> In mid-June however, another [[Egyptian Constituent Assembly of 2012|100-member assembly]] was officially selected a week after a deal was reached between the ruling military council and representatives of 22 parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18360403|title=Egypt parties end deadlock over constitutional panel|date=June 8, 2012|publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/44696.aspx|title=Official: The 100 members of Egypt's revamped Constituent Assembly|date=June 12, 2012|publisher=Al-Ahram}}</ref> Tensions later resumed after a court ruled that the entire Islamist-dominated parliament was illegally elected and ordered the body to dissolve, which angered the Brotherhood and [[Mohamed Beltagy]] called it a "full-fledged coup".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/egypt-court-rules-entire-parliament-illegally-elected-orders-body-to-dissolve-after-unconstitutional-vote/|title=Egypt court rules entire parliament illegally elected, orders body to dissolve after unconstitutional vote|date=June 14, 2012|publisher=CBS News}}</ref> On 18 June, the SCAF issued a supplementary constitutional declaration that limits the to-be president's power over the military and gives it complete control over all army decisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18494178|title=Q&A: Egypt's new constitutional declaration|date=June 18, 2012|publisher=BBC}}</ref> However, those controversial moves never changed the status of the constituent assembly as it was elected by the [[Shura Council]] not by parliament.

Amid a climate of dissent and division, '''Tamarod''' (Arabic for "rebellion"), a grassroots movement, was founded in April 2013 by five young activists with ages ranging between 22 and 30 years old. They orchestrated a door-to-door, street-level campaign collecting signatures from Egyptians across the country calling for, among other demands, President Morsi<U+2019>s resignation, early presidential elections and the start of a renewed constituent process.<ref name="Jadaliyya Tamarod">{{cite web|url=http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/12516/tamarod_egypts-revolution-hones-its-skills|title=Tamarod: Egypt's Revolution Hones its Skills|date=June 30, 2013|publisher=Jadaliyya}}</ref> Tamarod was supported by various opposition parties and autonomous social movements.  The campaign, reminiscent of 1919<U+2019>s collection of petitions [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919|against British occupation]], called for massive protests all over the country on 30 June 2013, which was the first anniversary of Morsi's inauguration, to create popular pressure on the government to see through their demands. The campaign<U+2019>s leading members [[Mahmoud Badr]], [[Hassan Shahin]], [[Mohamed Abdel Aziz (activist)|Mohamed Abdel Aziz]], [[Mai Wahba]] and [[Mohamed Heikal (activist)|Mohamed Heikal]], initially unfamiliar to the public, started to continuously gain strong popularity among Egyptians reflected in the people<U+2019>s eagerness to publicly register their names, ID card numbers and signatures on the petition form.<ref name="Jadaliyya Tamarod"/> The movement was also intensifying its political activity, uniting all anti-Brotherhood parties and most political factions in its mission. Among the groups supporting it were the [[National Salvation Front (Egypt)|National Salvation Front]], the [[Kefaya|Kefaya Movement]] and the [[April 6 Youth Movement]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Reactions vary to the Rebel movement's 30 June plans|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/06/05/reactions-vary-to-tamarods-30-june-plans/|agency=Daily News Egypt|date=June 5, 2013}}</ref> These also included members of the former National Democratic Party who, as stated by [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], were allowed to participate as long as they weren<U+2019>t convicted of any crimes such as Morsi's 2012 rival candidate [[Ahmed Shafik]] who supported the protests.<ref>{{cite news|title=Egypt opposition opens to former autocrat's party|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/06/22/Egypt-opposition-opens-to-former-autocrat-s-party.html|agency=Al-Arabiya|date=June 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Tamarod clarifies Shafiq endorsement|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/05/18/tamarod-clarifies-shafiq-endorsement/|agency=Daily News Egypt|date=May 18, 2013}}</ref> However, the presidency and its supporters had a different reaction to Tamarod which was far from appeasing the population. A counter-campaign called "Tagarod" (Arabic for "impartiality") was started by [[Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]] member [[Assem Abdel Maged]], who called on Morsi's supporters to sign this petition to keep the "legitimately elected president in his post".<ref>{{cite news|title=Tagarod campaign to counter Tamarod|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/05/13/tagarod-campaign-to-counter-tamarod/|agency=Daily News Egypt|date=May 13, 2013}}</ref> Abdel Maged's campaign however, proved unsuccessful in terms of impact compared to Tamarod which was able to penetrate and mobilize the "[[Couch Party]]", the silent majority of Egyptians who usually avoid participating in political events but prominently joined anti-Morsi demonstrations this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/16279|title=Egypt<U+2019>s Tamarrud: A Revolution for the Lazy?|date=June 29, 2013|publisher=Al Akhbar}}</ref> The movement's effectiveness in sparking the uprising against Morsi had organizations like the ''[[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]]'' dubbing the events as the "Tamarod Revolution".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/about/campaign/egypts-tamarod-revolution-faq|title=Egypt's Tamarod Revolution: A Video FAQ|publisher=Washington Institute for Near East Policy}}</ref> Not only this, but it directly inspired many other copycat campaigns throughout the Arab world such as [[Gaza]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/politics/2013/10/gaza-tamarod-protests-oust-hamas.html|title=Gaza<U+2019>s Tamarod Calls for Nov. 11 Protests to Oust Hamas|date=October 9, 2013|publisher=Al-Monitor}}</ref> [[Morocco]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/moroccos-islamists-rescued-from-early-elections|title=Morocco's Islamists Rescued from Early Elections|date=September 6, 2013|publisher=Washington Institute for Near East Policy}}</ref> [[Tunisia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://northafricapost.com/4075-tunisia-condemns-its-version-of-tamarod.html|title=Tunisia condemns its version of Tamarod|date=July 23, 2013|publisher=The North Africa Post}}</ref> and [[Yemen]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/07/yemen-divided-egypt-crisis-morsi.html|title=Yemen Divided Over Egypt|date=July 12, 2013|publisher=Al-Monitor}}</ref> as well as [[Bahrain Tamarod|a new wave of protests]] in [[Bahrain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/bahrain-in-egypt-s-shadow|title=Bahrain in Egypt<U+2019>s Shadow|date=September 27, 2013|publisher=Atlantic Council}}</ref>

===Allegations of previous military involvement ===
Egypt's [[Egyptian Armed Forces|military]] has long showed discontent at Morsi's policies and viewed the political tensions between the government and its opponents as a threat to the nation's stability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/72030.aspx|title=Sinai crisis heightens tension between Egypt president, army chief: Sources|date=May 21, 2013|publisher=Al-Ahram}}</ref><ref name="Huff Post Sisi June 23">{{cite news|title=Egypt Morsi Protests: Army Ready To Save Nation From 'Dark Tunnel,' Defense Minister Says |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/23/egypt-morsi-protests-army-ready-to-save-nation-dark-tunnel_n_3486903.html|agency=AP|date=23 June 2013}}</ref> This had had come to light following a huge Islamist rally in support of the [[Syrian Civil War|Syrian uprising]] sponsored by the Brotherhood in [[Cairo Stadium]]. The conference was meant to warn those hoping to push Mohamed Morsi out of office, and was aimed at forging stronger ties with extremist Islamist groups. Morsi shocked the nation then by cutting diplomatic ties with [[Syria]] and by remaining silent while hardliners were calling for jihad to combat the Syrian regime and [[Shiite]] fighters and when they were using sectarian speech towards Shiite Muslims. What worried the army though, is that Morsi, while not explicitly calling himself for holy war, delivered a speech in which he called for a foreign intervention against [[Bashar al-Assad]]'s government by establishing a [[no-fly zone]] over Syria. The military responded by issuing a statement where it argued that its only role is to guard Egypt's borders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/75564/Egypt/Politics-/Morsi-role-at-Syria-rally-seen-as-tipping-point-fo.aspx|title=Morsi role at Syria rally seen as tipping point for Egypt army|date=July 3, 2013|publisher=Al-Ahram}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/06/15/syria_egypts_morsi_cuts_diplomatic_ties_calls_for_nofly_zone.html|title=Syria: Egypt<U+2019>s Morsi cuts diplomatic ties, calls for no-fly zone|date=June 15, 2013|publisher=Toronto Star}}</ref>

On 23 June, [[General]] [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] issued a statement warning all sides saying that the [[Egyptian Army|army]] will not allow the country to fall into a <U+201C>dark tunnel of conflict<U+201D>. He also added:<ref name="Huff Post Sisi June 23"/>
<blockquote>"Those who think that we (the military) are oblivious to the dangers that threaten the Egyptian state are mistaken. We will not remain silent while the country slips into a conflict that will be hard to control"</blockquote>

After Morsi was ousted on July 3, most of the country's energy crises, that were very common during Morsi's presidency, were surprisingly diminished following the coup d'<U+00E9>tat. ''[[The New York Times]]'' (NYT) claims there might have been a campaign orchestrated by members of the old Mubarak regime and top military generals that was meant to undermine Mohamed Morsi's one-year rule. The reason for this belief is that state agencies responsible for providing electricity and ensuring gas supplies failed so fundamentally so gas lines and [[rolling blackouts]] fueled widespread anger at the government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/11/world/middleeast/improvements-in-egypt-suggest-a-campaign-that-undermined-morsi.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|title=Sudden Improvements in Egypt Suggest a Campaign to Undermine Morsi|date=July 10, 2013|publisher=The New York Times}}</ref> NYT also claims that a smear media campaign against Morsi, that began immediately following Morsi's inauguration, helped feed popular discontent towards the authorities by adopting a contradictory stance through favoring the military while honoring Morsi's position as president of the republic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/14/world/middleeast/president-morsi-of-egypt-is-undercut-by-state-run-media.html|title=Egypt<U+2019>s New President Is Being Undercut by State-Run Media|date=July 13, 2012|publisher=The New York Times}}</ref>

==Preparation and security precautions==
During security measures in [[Upper Egypt]], the [[Luxor]] security directorate announced that it had transferred all those jailed in the local police station to Qena prison as a mean of avoiding the 2011 scenario due to the risk of violence. [[Aswan]] saw heavy security presence and the police chief announced that he will personally head the operation room to receive complaints and information during the demonstrations and said that security personnel will protect their stations as well as state property, and added that the people will be protected, not the regime or any political party. Members of the FJP have gathered in front of their party headquarters to secure the complex. These procedures took place on June 30, the day of protests.<ref name="Al-Ahram June 30 Live">{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/75297.aspx|title=Live updates: Millions join anti-Morsi protests in Egypt|date=30 June 2013|publisher=Al-Ahram}}</ref><ref name="Aswat Masriya updates">{{cite web|url=http://en.aswatmasriya.com/news/view.aspx?id=2cddf5c7-9402-4b14-8920-9e0d8da52e0c|title=Updates on protests against Mursi after his first year in office|date=June 30, 2013|publisher=Aswat Masriya}}</ref><ref name="Al Ahram June 30 Live 2">{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/75341.aspx|title=Live updates 2: Millions on streets for anti-Morsi protests; 4 dead in Upper Egypt|date=30 June 2013|publisher=Al-Ahram}}</ref>

According to information that came out after the removal of Morsi, officials claimed that Morsi stopped working at the [[Egyptian Presidential Palace|presidential office]] as early as June 26 in anticipation to the protests and moved with his family to [[Koubbeh Palace]], just a few blocks away from the main palace.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hendawi|first=Hamza|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/his-final-days-morsi-was-isolated-defiant|title=In his final days, Morsi was isolated but defiant|publisher=Associated Press|date=July 4, 2013}}</ref>

===Fears of violence against Copts===
Weeks prior to the protests, [[Coptic Christians]], particularly in [[Upper Egypt]], received threats from Morsi's Islamist supporters, pressuring them not to take part in the protests. Sheikh Essam Abdulamek, a member of parliament's [[Shura Council]], said in an interview on television that Christians should not participate in the protests and warned them "do not sacrifice your children [since the] general Muslim opinion will not be silent about the ousting of the president." Letters were delivered to Christian families in [[Minya]] where they were threatened not to join the protests, otherwise their "businesses, cars, homes, schools, and churches" might "catch fire".<ref name="Human Events">{{cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/2013/07/03/pro-morsi-terrorists-threaten-christians-against-protesting/|title=Pro-Morsi forces threaten Christians against protesting|publisher=Human Events|date=July 3, 2013}}</ref> The letters, signed by "Peaple zealous of the nation", read:
<blockquote>"If you are not worried about any of these, then worry about your children and your homes. This message is being delivered with tact. But when the moment of truth comes, there will be no tact."<ref name="Human Events"/></blockquote>
There have been incitements against Copts by some of Morsi's staunchest allies such as [[Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]]'s leading hardline cleric [[Assem Abdel Maged]] directly threatened the country's Christian community by saying "if you go down into the streets on 30 June, you will bring black days onto yourselves." President Mohamed Morsi himself invited [[Pope Tawadros II of Alexandria|Pope Tawadros II]] to a meeting at the country's presidential palace in what has been seen as an attempt to put pressure on him while the pope told Morsi to do what is necessary to bring the nation together and work for the peace of Egypt, not to stir up quarrels. "I am still hoping to see improvements in the economic and social life of the country," he said, while Morsi suggested that the church should advise Egypt<U+2019>s Christian community not to participate in the protests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/3146/17/Egypt%E2%80%99s-Copts-defiant-.aspx|title=Egypt<U+2019>s Copts defiant|date=June 17, 2013|publisher=Al-Ahram}}</ref> Another pro-Morsi cleric [[Safwat Hegazi]] addressed the country's Christians by saying:"You share this country with us, but there are red lines, and one red line is the legitimacy of Dr. Morsi.

===June 28===
[[File:Anti Morsi protest march at 28th June 2013.jpg|thumb|Anti-Morsi demonstrators marching in Cairo on June 28]]
On Friday 28 June, protests against Morsi started to build throughout Egypt including in such cities as [[Cairo]], [[Alexandria]], [[Dakahlia Governorate|Dakahlia]], [[Gharbiya]] and [[Aswan]] as a "warm up" for the massive protests expected on 30 June that were planned by Tamarod. Pro-Morsi and Muslim Brotherhood supporters started counterdemonstrations at the [[Rabia Al-Adawiya Mosque]] in Nasr City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/75483.aspx |title=Egypt warms up for a decisive day of anti- and pro-Morsi protests |publisher=English.ahram.org.eg |date=7 February 2013 |accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref>

===June 29===
Deadly clashes broke out this day in several Egyptian cities, most notably [[Alexandria]], where armed confrontations between Morsi's supporters and his opponents, with both sides in the fighting armed with different kinds of firearms, left many injured and three dead, a 14-year old boy, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood who was shot dead and an American student, Andrew Pochter, was killed after being stabbed in the chest during an anti-Morsi rally. Protesters stormed the headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood's ruling [[Freedom and Justice Party (Egypt)|Freedom and Justice Party]] (FJP) and set the building ablaze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/06/egypt-violence-ahead-of-june-30-protests.html#|title=Deadly Violence Breaks out in Egypt Ahead of June 30 Protests|date=June 29, 2013|publisher=Al-Monitor}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/us-student-stabbed-to-death-during-egypt-protests-was-in-the-country-teaching-children-english-8679669.html|title=US student stabbed to death during Egypt protests was in the country teaching children English|date=June 29, 2013|publisher=The Independent}}</ref> In [[Port Said]], a bomb detonated in the city's Martyrs Square where protesters had gathered to protest against Mohamed Morsi.

In Cairo, the president's opponents started building up in anticipation for June 30's uprising as thousands of anti-Morsi demonstrators took to [[Tahrir Square]] with the number of tents increasing to 150. At the presidential palace, protesters set up 18 tents and erected a stage at the entrance of [[Heliopolis Sporting Club]]. Five [[Central Security Forces|CSF]] trucks and a fire-fighting vehicle went to reside in the location as a security precaution.<ref name="Al-Ahram June 29 protests">{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/75217/Egypt/Politics-/Protesters-around-Cairo-build-up-sitins-for--June.aspx|title=Protesters around Cairo build up sit-ins for 30 June|date=June 29, 2013|publisher=Al-Ahram}}</ref> This day, Tamarod claimed to have collected more than 22 million signatures their petition caling for Morsi to step down. The numbers were announced in a press conference statement in which the group's leaders described the 30 June protests as a new wave of the 2011 revolution that and stressed that "Morsy has lost legitimacy after millions of signatures calling for his removal were collected, and after he refused to respect the constitution and the law". The statement also urged protesters to remain peaceful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/tamarod-petition-has-22-million-signatures|title=Tamarod petition has 22 million signatures|date=June 29, 2013|publisher=Egypt Independent}}</ref> On the other hand, thousands staged an open-ended rally since Friday which was called for by 40 Islamist parties and groups led by the FJP and was held under the banner "Democratic legitimacy is a red line".<ref name="Al-Ahram June 29 protests"/>

===June 30: Revolution Day===
{{Expand section|date=January 2014}}<!--Whole paragraph(s) needed about death toll and overall number of protesters in each location that day-->
The much anticipated day begins with several marches throughout [[Cairo]] on Sunday heading to either [[Tahrir Square]] or [[Heliopolis Palace|Ittihadiya Palace]] with other comparatively smaller protests taking place at [[Rabaa Al-Adawiya Mosque|Rabaa al-Adawiya square]], where pro-Morsi demonstrators are mainly centered, and another around the Ministry of Culture in [[Zamalek]] with artists and intellectuals staging a sit-in chanting against the Morsi-appointed Culture Minister. The [[30 June Front]] announced that open-ended sit-ins have been staged in Tahrir and across the country until President Mohamed Morsi steps down and until the people's legitimate demands have been answered.<ref name="Al-Ahram June 30 Live"/> Tahrir started filling with protesters as early as 8:00 AM with street emptied of traffic and nearly all shops were closed for the day. The people started chanting "Down, down with the rule of the Morshed (Supreme Guide of the Muslim Brotherhood)" and "He will leave, we won't leave".<ref name="WSJ June 30 Live">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/middleeast/2013/06/30/live-egypt-protests/|title=Live: Egypt Protests|date=30 June 2013|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref> By 11:00 AM, thousands had already gathered in the square and organizers claimed in advance the support of millions to come.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2013/jun/30/egypt-mohamed-morsi-protests-live|title=Egypt's Mohamed Morsi faces mass protests: live updates|date=30 June 2013|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref> Two main marches that headed to Tahrir came from [[Giza]] with tens of thousands rallying along [[Dokki]]'s Tahrir Street joined by opposition leader [[Hamdeen Sabahi]] and prominent filmmaker [[Khaled Youssef]].

Although Morsi opponents had staged protest camps outside [[Heliopolis Palace|Ittihadiya Palace]], one of the country's main presidential palaces, in Cairo's [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis]] suburb two days prior to the revolution, the number of protesters was relatively low with only a few hundred demonstrators present at the vicinity around 5:30 PM, compared to the huge masses staged in Tahrir Square and [[Sidi Gaber]] in Egypt's second city of [[Alexandria]] at the time. At the beginning, this was surprising to some who considered the location to be a second focal point of anti-Morsi protests in Cairo along with Tahrir. Most of the palace's gates were left unguarded except for gate 5 which saw a high concentration of armoured vehicles and police was nowhere to be seen but three were reportedly arrested by night in possession of weapons including blades and firearms, according to state news agency ''[[MENA (news)|MENA]]''.<ref name="Al-Ahram June 30 Live"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/06/30/in-pictures-pro-morsi-rally-at-rabaa-al-adaweya/|title=In Pictures: Pro-Morsi Rally at Raba<U+2019>a Al-Adaweya|date=30 June 2013|publisher=Daily News Egypt}}</ref> By 5:45 PM however, demonstrators started pouring in with tens of thousands coming individually or in rallies such as the march coming from [[El-Quba|Saray el-Qubba]] carrying Egyptian flags, red cards and waving banners of previously slain protesters such as [[Khalid Said]] while chanting anti-Morsi slogans, most notably ''"[[Ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam|The people demand the fall of the regime]]"''.<ref name="Al-Ahram June 30 Live"/><ref name="Al Ahram June 30 Live 2"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/06/egyptians-demonstrate-in-large-numbers-against-morsi.html#|title=Millions of Egyptians Demand Morsi<U+2019>s Downfall|date=June 30, 2013|publisher=Al-Monitor}}</ref> At around 7:30 PM, the palace's surroundings were reportedly packed with protesters filling a broad boulevard for blocks and spilling into nearby avenues and ''Al-Ahram'' reported that the site was extremely crowded with even moving small distances taking a long time and according to the Health Ministry, one protester suffocated to death as a result of a [[Human crush|crowd crush]].<ref name="Al Ahram June 30 Live 2"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/crowds-march-egypt-pushing-morsi-removal-154031220.html|title=Crowds march in Egypt, pushing for Morsi removal|date=June 30, 2013|publisher=Yahoo News}}</ref><ref name="BBC MB HQ">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23125387|title=Egypt protesters storm Muslim Brotherhood headquarters|date=July 1, 2013|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The demonstrations' mood was seemingly jovial with fireworks keeping the atmosphere upbeat and protesters cheering patrolling military helicopters the vicinity with laser lights.<ref name="Al Ahram June 30 Live 2"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/egypt-protest-pictures-2013-6|title=These Photos Show Just How Massive The Protests In Egypt Have Become|date=June 30, 2013|publisher=Business Insider}}</ref> ''[[MENA (news)|MENA]]'' reported that political forces present there announced that they will stage an open-ended sit-in till the president steps down.<ref name="Al Ahram June 30 Live 2"/>

Like many scenarios that occurred in the Delta on Sunday, Upper Egypt also had demonstrators occupying government buildings, most notably in Assiut and Sohag.

Simultaneously, residents in three villages held the funeral of the second victim, Mohamed Nasef, who belonged to one of the biggest families in Assiut.

The army issued a statement on live television in response to the huge protest marches and violent clashes that have swept Cairo and other cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/10152780/Egypt-protests-Army-issues-48-hour-ultimatum-for-agreement-amid-clashes.html|title=Egypt protests: Army issues 48-hour ultimatum for agreement amid clashes|date=July 1, 2013|publisher=The Telegraph}}</ref> General [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] said that the country's "political forces" involved in the crisis have 48 hours to meet the people's demands or else the armed forces would intervene to impose a road map. An hour later, five military helicopters trailing with huge national flags flew in broad circles over Cairo as thousands of demonstrators in Tahrir Square and in the vicinity of the presidential palace applauded them. In celebration of the announcement, millions of Egyptians started re-flooding the streets, where thousands still remained from Sunday's mass protests against Morsi. The crowds appeared to believe that this was the end for Morsi and according to some, the timing of the military declaration, coming only 24 hours before the next round of opposition protests, seemed certain to encourage the president<U+2019>s opponents. A Morsi aide told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that el-Sisi's ultimatum was "a military coup". But the army denied it insisted that it was seeking to stop Egypt from entering a "dark tunnel of conflict". The National Salvation Front also endorsed the ultimatum and supported the military's decision as a defense of the will of the people. Finally, late in the day the Muslim Brotherhood said the army action was not a coup but a security measure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2013/jul/01/egypt-stanoff-millions-protest|title=Egypt protests: army issues 48-hour ultimatum - as it happened|date=July 1, 2013|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/07/egyptian-military-threatens-intervention-following-protests.html|title=Egypt<U+2019>s Military Steps In, Issues Ultimatum|date=July 1, 2013|publisher=Al-Monitor}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/egyptians-react-to-armys-ultimatum/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0|title=Egyptians React to Army<U+2019>s Ultimatum|date=July 1, 2013|publisher=The New York Times}}</ref>

Groups of people wearing high-visibility jackets were spreading out patrolling the demonstration. Qubba<U+2019>s vicinity, one of this day<U+2019>s highlights, became a major location for protests only this weekend because [[2012<U+2013>13 Egyptian protests|during the previous months]] anti-Morsi marches usually headed to Tahrir Square or to Ittihadiya instead. The reason behind that is because the president moved from the Egypt<U+2019>s official presidential palace to Quba Palace, and as a result, the site became a popular rallying point for demonstrations during this uprising.<ref name="LU Ahram July 2"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elwatannews.com/news/details/217037|title=<U+0645><U+0633><U+064A><U+0631><U+0627><U+062A> "<U+0627><U+0644><U+0632><U+0627><U+0648><U+064A><U+0629> <U+0627><U+0644><U+062D><U+0645><U+0631><U+0627><U+0621>" <U+0648>"<U+0627><U+0644><U+062A><U+062D><U+0631><U+064A><U+0631>" <U+062A><U+062A><U+0648><U+0627><U+0641><U+062F> <U+0639><U+0644><U+0649> <U+0642><U+0635><U+0631> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0642><U+0628><U+0629>|date=July 2, 2013|publisher=Al-Watan (Arabic)}}</ref> Many protesters were chanting in favour of the military and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, as chants of "the people and the army are one hand" were very common and spray-painted <U+201C>Game Over<U+201D> on the gates of the palace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/07/02/protests-continue-at-presidential-al-qobba-palaces-and-tahrir-square/|title=Protests continue at presidential, Al-Qobba palaces and Tahrir Square|date=July 2, 2013|publisher=Daily News Egypt}}</ref> Another wave of resignations similar to Monday's included Foreign Minister [[Mohamed Kamel Amr]] who decided to step down in response to the unrest, along with presidential spokesman Ehab Fahmy and cabinet spokesman Alaa al-Hadidi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/75458/Egypt/Politics-/Egypts-foreign-minister-resigns-following-antiMors.aspx|title=Egypt's foreign minister resigns following anti-Morsi rallies|date=July 2, 2013|publisher=Al-Ahram}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/latest-wave-resignations-cabinet-presidency-spokesmen-quit|title=Latest wave of resignations as Cabinet, Presidency spokesmen quit|date=July 2, 2013|publisher=Egypt Independent}}</ref>

This day saw significant numbers of pro-Morsi marches across the country as many started to suspect a coup would take place. Hundreds of Morsi supporters gathered in front of [[Cairo University]] in Al-Nahda Square as nationwide demonstrations entered their third consecutive day. The protesters, whose numbers were increasing, blocked roads leading to the front gates of the campus and erected a stage in a show of support for the embattled president<U+2019>s legitimacy following a statement issued by the armed forces on Monday. The rallies, along with many other similar ones in several parts of Egypt, were organized by Salafist groups such as Al-Gamaa al-Islamiyya which stated that pro-Morsi demonstrations this day would take place in 11 different governorates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/07/02/cairo-university-demonstration-fears-armed-forces-return-to-politics/|title=Cairo University demonstration fears Armed Forces<U+2019> return to politics|date=June 2, 2013|publisher=Daily News Egypt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/07/02/al-jamaa-al-islamiya-organises-nationwide-demonstrations/|title=Al-Jamaa Al-Islamiya organises nationwide demonstrations|date=July 2, 2013|publisher=Daily News Egypt}}</ref> Around Rabaa Al-Adawiya Mosque in Nasr City, the president<U+2019>s supporters gathered in their hundreds of thousands, a clear defiance of the millions of anti-Morsi demonstrators who gathered in dozens of squares across Egypt.<ref name="LU Ahram July 2"/> In Upper Egypt, thousands of Morsi supporters prominently gathered in the cities of Minya, Assiut and Qena among others.

====Morsi's speech====
Later that night, President Mohamed Morsi made his first official speech since the events began on Sunday where he appeared defiant to the military's ultimatum and refused to back down. He admitted that me made mistakes but insisted that he was the legitimate democratically elected president and hinted that any effort to remove him by force would plunge the nation into chaos. He also seemed to disregard the record numbers of Egyptians who took to the streets demanding his resignation:<ref name="NYC Morsi speech">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/03/world/middleeast/egypt-protests.html?pagewanted=all|title=Morsi Defies Egypt Army<U+2019>s Ultimatum to Bend to Protest|date=July 2, 2013|publisher=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/egypts-morsi-says-he-wont-step-down-vows-protect-his-v19246354|title=Egypt's Morsi says he won't step down, vows to protect his legitimacy|date=July 2, 2013|publisher=NBC News}}</ref>
<blockquote>"The people empowered me, the people chose me, through a free and fair election,

Legitimacy is the only way to protect our country and prevent bloodshed, to move to a new phase,... Legitimacy is the only thing that guarantees for all of us that there will not be any fighting and conflict, that there will not be bloodshed.

If the price of protecting legitimacy is my blood, I<U+2019>m willing to pay it,... And it would be a cheap price for the sake of protecting this country."<ref name="NYC Morsi speech"/></blockquote>
The speech was immediately denounced by opposition activists who viewed it as delusional and made them feel instead that their battle was largely won. On the other hand, thousands of Morsi<U+2019>s supporters kept demonstrating across the country and chanting their slogan "Legitimacy", a word that repeated by Morsi at least two dozen times in the speech, to counter their opponents<U+2019> "Leave". Some Muslim Brotherhood members said that if a coup did happen, they would await orders from the group's leaders. Many remained convinced, however, that the military would stand back and change its mind to avoid bloodshed and violence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/egypts-morsi-under-increasing-pressure-as-deadline-looms/2013/07/02/fcb11aa0-e315-11e2-a11e-c2ea876a8f30_story.html|title=Egypt<U+2019>s Morsi defiant under pressure as deadline looms|date=July 2, 2013|publisher=The Washington Post}}</ref>

There were violent clashes that erupted in other parts of the city when a rally by estimated hundreds of Morsi's Islamist supporters, who were chanting "The people want to apply the law of God!", was intercepted by residents of the [[Agami]] district who tried to obstruct the march in objection to the demonstration's slogans.
