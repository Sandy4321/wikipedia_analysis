'''''The X-Files''''' is a [[Peabody_Award|Peabody]]- and [[Emmy Award]]-winning [[science fiction]] [[television]] series, created by [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], which [[premiere|first aired]] on [[September 10]], [[1993]] and ended on [[May 19]], [[2002]]. The show was one of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] network's first major hits, and its main characters and slogans (e.g. "The Truth Is Out There," "Trust No One," "Deny Everything," "I Want to Believe") became [[pop culture]] touchstones. ''The X-Files'' was seen as a defining series of the [[1990s]], coinciding with the era's widespread distrust of [[governments]], interest in [[conspiracy theories]] and [[spirituality]], and belief in the existence of [[extraterrestrial life]].<ref name="ST JAMES">St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture entry on X-Files.

In the series, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) are tasked with investigating the eponymous "X-Files," marginalized cases often involving [[paranormal phenomena]]. In one flashback episode, it is explained that the reason the "X-Files" were used is that there was no more room in the "U" file, for "unsolved case" files. Mulder plays the role of the "[[belief|believer]]," having faith in the existence of [[space aliens|aliens]] and the paranormal, while Scully is a [[skeptic]], initially assigned by her departmental superiors to [[debunker|debunk]] Mulder's unconventional work. As the show progressed both agents became embroiled in the same larger conflicts (termed "the mythology" or "[[Story arc|mytharc]]" by the show's creators) and developed a close and ambiguous friendship<U+2014>which some fans, known as "[[shipping (fandom)|shippers]],"<ref name="study">Scodari, Christine, and Jenna L.

''The X-Files'' also featured stand-alone episodes ranging in tone from [[Horror fiction|horror]] to [[comedy]], in which Mulder and Scully investigated uniquely bizarre cases without long-term implications on the storyline. These so-called "[[List of MOTW characters|monster of the week]]" episodes made up the bulk of the series.

The show's popularity peaked in the mid-to-late '90s, even inspiring an international hit [[The X-Files: Fight the Future|movie]] in 1998. However, in the last two seasons, Anderson became the star as Duchovny appeared rarely, and new central characters were introduced: FBI Agents John Doggett ([[Robert Patrick]]) and Monica Reyes ([[Annabeth Gish]]). At the time of its final episode, ''The X-Files'' was the longest running [[Science fiction television|sci-fi show]] ever on [[United States|American]] TV (a title since lost to ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''). The show was declared by ''[[TV Guide]]'' to be the second greatest [[cult television]] show<ref>

Other important characters throughout most of the show's run included the mysterious '''[[Cigarette Smoking Man]]''', or '''"Cancer Man"''' (played by [[William B. Davis]]); "[[counterculture]] patriot" research trio '''[[The Lone Gunmen]]'''; the loyalty-shifting '''[[Alex Krycek]]''' ([[Nicholas Lea]]); the '''families of Scully and Mulder''', including Fox Mulder's disappeared sister '''[[Samantha Mulder|Samantha]]'''; and the agents' '''[[List of X-Files informants|informants]]''', beginning with '''[[Deep Throat (The X-Files)|Deep Throat]]''' ([[Jerry Hardin]]) and '''[[X (The X-Files)|X]]''' ([[Steven Williams]]).

Additionally, the [[Alien Bounty Hunter]] ([[Brian Thompson]]) appeared frequently beginning in season two; the [[Well-Manicured Man]] ([[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]]) and the [[First Elder (The X-Files)|First Elder]] ([[Don S. Williams]]) beginning in season three; [[Marita Covarrubias]] ([[Laurie Holden]]) beginning in season four; and [[Cassandra Spender]] ([[Veronica Cartwright]]), [[Jeffrey Spender]] ([[Chris Owens]]) and [[Diana Fowley]] ([[Mimi Rogers]]) beginning in season five. Some of these characters were eventually written out of the show. Many other characters were important for more limited periods.

==Plot and mythology==
''The X-Files'' was considered unique for a popular TV show of the 1990s, in combining continuing, [[serial drama]] elements (such as those often found in [[miniseries]] and [[soap operas]]) with individual stories which did not require a viewer to understand the show's history.<ref name="study"/> Fans and the show's producers commonly divide ''X-Files'' stories into two categories: "''Mythology''" or "''Mytharc''" episodes, which concerned the ongoing tale of a governmental conspiracy regarding the extraterrestrial, and [[stand-alone]] episodes (sometimes called "''[[List of MOTW characters|Monster-of-the-Week]]''" or "''Freak-of-the-Week''" episodes), which dealt with unusual creatures and situations relating to the paranormal, generally being unrelated to the series mythology. Some fans have even gone so far as to write up the entire storyline of the show, including every important date,<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/Studio/9013/myth.html The Mythology]</ref> while others have examined its internal consistencies and contradictions.<ref>[http://www.entil2001.com/series/x-files/reviews/season3/3-2.html Review of "Paper Clip" and other episodes from standpoint of mythology consistency]</ref>

===Mytharc episodes===
Major mythology episodes were typically presented as season premieres and finales each year, as well as several times throughout most seasons, making up about one third of the episodes. They often occurred as two-part stories during [[sweeps]] months (beginning with "Duane Barry"/"Ascension" and "Colony"/"End Game" in the second season).

Below is a list of episodes that directly concern the mythology of ''The X-Files'' in broadcast order. <!--This section does NOT list all alien-related episodes, or all the "best" or "essential" episodes. Episodes which tangentially involve the conspiracy (i.e. "Ghost in the Machine", "Triangle"), or involve the main characters in emotional situations relating to it (i.e. "Paper Hearts", "Leonard Betts", "Demons"), but in the end do not "directly concern" the PLOT of the mythology, are not considered mythology episodes for the purposes of this list. That means comedy episodes (i.e. "Jose Chung's From Outer Space", "Dreamland") are also not counted as mythology; neither are the Lone Gunmen-centered episodes; or historical episodes that don't center around main characters, such as "Travelers" and "The Unnatural". One could make an argument for several of the above, and many more, to be listed as mythology, but it would open many other "stand alones" to question (for explanation, see "Other types of episodes"). The purpose of this section is not to debate why the distinction exists, but to summarize the common view of what is "mythology" in The X-Files.

However, there are several differences between what is included on the official DVDs released by FOX in 2005- Abduction, Black Oil, Colonization, Super Soldiers- and what was widely considered a mythology episode by fans and critics at the time of its airing, which should determine the episodes listed here. FOR EXAMPLE, "Conduit", "Sleepless", "Wetwired", "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man", "Christmas Carol" and "Emily" ARE currently listed, despite not being on the official DVDs, while "Red Museum" is NOT included despite being on the DVDs. If you edit the list, please reflect your changes here as well.-->

===Other types of episodes===
[[Image:Walterskinner.jpg|thumb|left|<small>Several episodes were centered on Mulder and Scully's boss at the FBI, Assistant Director [[Walter Skinner]] (played by [[Mitch Pileggi]]).</small>]]

Several installments explored the relationship between Mulder and Scully, while some episodes focused on supporting characters such as [[Walter Skinner]] or the [[The Lone Gunmen|Lone Gunmen]]. Such episodes sometimes fell in a gray area between "mythology" and stand-alone. Chris Carter said the producers "wanted to avoid the '[[Freak of the week|monster of the week]]' syndrome,"<ref name="INT CARTER"/> so even stand-alone episodes sometimes involved aliens and government conspiracies (particularly during the show's first and sixth seasons), and many "monster" episodes also had important developments for the characters and plot of the show (particularly early episodes in the second and fourth seasons). There is disagreement about whether episodes ranging from season 1's "Beyond the Sea" to season 6's "The Unnatural" may properly be counted as mythology, as the producers did try for a degree of [[continuity]]. However, most viewers considered episodes to be mythology only if they involved the specific conspiracy around alien life that was considered central to ''The X-Files''.

For example, "Sleepless" and "Wetwired" feature the close involvement of ongoing conspiracy elements and characters in certain scenes. However, these two episodes, along with several other episodes in the above list, were not included on the officially released ''X-Files'' "mythology" [[DVD]]s. Alternately, the episodes "Soft Light" and "Leonard Betts" have rarely been considered mythology, although the former is an episode about a government conspiracy involving an important side character, and the latter is a monster episode with pivotal character revelations connecting to the larger plot. Likewise, the "Dreamland" two-parter is about a [[Men in Black (The X-Files)|man in black]] working at [[Area 51]], but the story is more of a [[parody]] than a mythology episode that ties in with others.
[[Image:Lonegun.jpg|thumb|right|<small>...while others centered around [[The Lone Gunmen]], a trio of conspiracy theorists who eventually merited their own [[The Lone Gunmen (TV Series)|spinoff]].</small>]]

===Non-paranormal episodes===
In many cases [[paranormal]] "X-File" elements were only a backdrop to [[characterization|character-driven]] plots, but nonetheless, nearly every episode of ''The X-Files'' involved [[supernatural]] or [[science fiction themes]] in some way. However, a small number of episodes were seen to depart from the show's central theme, involving bizarre, horrific or vaguely explained events, without being conventionally implausible. These include the popular episodes "Irresistible"<ref>Autumn Tysko. Review of "Irresistible". [http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Vault/1411/irresisA.html]</ref> and "Home", although in the first case some have seen supernatural elements in the episode as well. The episode "Hell Money" has also sometimes been included. Some have remarked on the strange fact that out of all the hundreds of cases Mulder and Scully investigate in ''The X-Files'' universe, nearly all of them actually turn out to involve the paranormal, possibly vindicating Mulder's desire to "believe" in anything and everything.<ref name="Anderson"/><ref>"Field Trip" reviews.

===Idea and pilot===
California native [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], who had previously met with limited success writing for television, was given the opportunity to [[television producer|produce]] new shows for the struggling [[FOX]] network in the early 1990s. Tired of the comedies he had been working on,<ref name="details">Edwards, Gavin. "Be Afraid, Be Very Afraid." Interview with Carter. ''Details'', November 1996.

Chicago Tribune. Interview with Gillian Anderson, January 19, 2006.  [http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2006/01/gillian_anderso.html]</ref> Nevertheless, the pilot with both Anderson and [[David Duchovny]] was successfully shot in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Canada]] in early [[1993]], and the show was picked up for the Friday night 9 pm slot on the American fall TV schedule. Carter started a new company named after his birthday, [[Ten Thirteen Productions]], to oversee ''The X-Files''.

The unique idea was to present [[FBI]] agents investigating [[extraterrestrials]] and [[paranormal]] events throughout the [[United States]], but Carter also wanted to deal directly with the characters' beliefs. Carter said, "I think of myself as a non-[[religion|religious]] person looking for [[religious experience]], so I think that's what the characters are sort of doing too."<ref name="CBC">Chris Carter interview.

Carter said, "Scully's point of view is the point of view of the show. And so the show has to be built on a solid foundation of [[science]], in order to have Mulder take a flight from it...

[[Image:The X-Files season 1 episode 0.jpg|thumb|left|<small>Scene from the "Pilot," written by show creator [[Chris Carter]]. Initial episodes for ''The X-Files'' dealt with [[alien abduction]].</small>]]

In the "[[Pilot (The X-Files)|Pilot]]," Scully is unwittingly set up to serve as a check on Mulder, in order that the government conspirators can contain the implications of his work on the X-File cases, which they view as a danger to their plans. Notably, the powerful [[shadow government]] official played by Canadian [[playwright]] and [[William Davis Centre for Actors Study|acting teacher]] [[William B. Davis]] and known only as the [[Cigarette Smoking Man]], or "Cancer Man", appears without speaking in the first and last scenes of the pilot episode, though his ongoing importance to the series was not yet established.<ref name="Vanc1">Vancouver Province interview with Carter, February 8, 1998. [http://www.mjq.net/xfiles/prov-carter.htm]</ref> The "unresolved [[sexual tension]]" between Mulder and Scully was also central from the beginning, although the agents were often openly at odds during the first season, and they were each given other brief romantic interests in certain episodes, such as "[[The Jersey Devil (The X-Files)|The Jersey Devil]]," "[[Fire (The X-Files)|Fire]]," and "[[Lazarus (The X-Files)|Lazarus]]." Carter thought the show should be "[[plot (narrative)|plot]]-driven," saying, "I didn't want the relationship to come before the cases."<ref name="Anderson">Interview with Gillian Anderson. ''Wrapped in Plastic'', August 1994. [http://www.gilliananderson.ws/transcripts/94_95/94wrapped.shtml]</ref> Thus, throughout ''The X-Files'', Mulder and Scully call each other by their last names, with rare exceptions.

Carter's boss at Fox, Peter Roth, brought on more experienced staff members from the start, many of whom had previously worked with him at [[Stephen J. Cannell]]'s production company.<ref>Lowry, Brian. ''The Truth is Out There: The Official Guide to The X-Files''. HarperPrism, 1995. pages 9-23.</ref> Two of the most highly-regarded [[screenwriter|writers]] were [[Glen Morgan]] and [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]]. Their contributions to the first two seasons, such as the episode "[[Beyond the Sea (The X-Files)|Beyond the Sea]]" (guest starring [[Brad Dourif]] as a condemned killer with psychic visions pivotal to Scully and to an X-file Mulder is investigating), were exceptionally popular and influential among fans<ref name="xwr">"X-Writers".

April 18, 1994.</ref> as well as the show's actors and Carter himself.<ref name="FAQ">Chris Carter [[FAQ|frequently asked questions]]. [http://www.turning-pages.com/carterconnection/faqb.htm]</ref> Morgan and Wong also returned for the first half of the fourth season. Prior to coming to ''The X-Files'', Wong and Morgan had worked extensively with [[David Nutter]], [[Rob Bowman]], and [[Kim Manners]] on [[cop drama]]s (such as ''[[The Commish]]'' and ''[[21 Jump Street]]'') produced for Cannell in the Vancouver area, where Chris Carter had also set up production for the low costs<ref name="CBC"/> and an array of natural environments. Nutter, Bowman and Manners all became frequent ''X-Files'' [[television director|directors]], with Nutter working on many of the darker episodes in the first three seasons. The duo of Wong and Morgan also had an important role in hiring several supporting actors on the show, as well as John Bartley, the [[cinematographer]] who gave ''The X-Files'' its early dark atmospheric look, and who won an [[Emmy Award]] in 1996 for his work<ref name="bartley">

The show, which made a big move to California in its sixth season, was originally going to be filmed there in the first place. Carter said, "we originally intended to film the pilot [in March 1993] in [[Los Angeles]]. When we couldn't find a good forest, we made a quick decision to come to Vancouver. As it turned out, it was three weeks that turned into five years.

===Seasons 1 &ndash; 2 (1993-1995)===
{{spoiler}}
In the first two seasons, [[executive producer]] [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter]] and co-executive producers [[Glen Morgan|Morgan]] and [[James Wong (producer)|Wong]], along with other writers, helped to define the show's fledgling [[story arc]].<ref name="xwr"/> The "[[mythology]]," as the producers called it, was initially established as a [[cover-up|government plot]] to cover up anything pertaining to the existence of extraterrestrial life, and Mulder's attempts to discover the fate of his sister, [[Samantha Mulder|Samantha]]. She had apparently been abducted years prior when Mulder was a child, profoundly affecting him and igniting his obsession with the paranormal. Carter himself had written the show's second episode after the pilot, the Daniel Sackheim-directed "[[Deep Throat (The X-Files episode)|Deep Throat]]," introducing the character of the same name (played by [[Jerry Hardin]]), the first of several secret government [[List of X-Files informants|informants]] who would alternately help and hinder Mulder and Scully.

"[[Conduit (The X-Files)|Conduit]]," the first of many episodes to deal with Mulder's [[repressed memory|repressed memories]] of his sister's abduction, was written by [[Howard Gordon]] and Alex Gansa. Gordon became another key writer/producer in the show's first four years, also writing "[[Fallen Angel (The X-Files)|Fallen Angel]]" and other episodes in the first season with Gansa. That early mythology episode centered on Mulder's futile efforts to discover a crashed [[UFO]] which was being covered up by the government. It also introduced [[ufology|UFO enthusiast]] and abduction victim Max Fenig, one of many idiosyncratic outsiders portrayed on the show, which helped attract an "intensely loyal" [[cult following|cult audience]] of fans.<ref name="cult">The [[The Virginian-Pilot|Virginian-Pilot]]. 1994. [http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1994/vp941215/12150051.htm]</ref> Fenig, played by Scott Bellis, returned for two episodes in the fourth season. Ironically, "Fallen Angel" also received the lowest [[Nielsen ratings]] of the first season. Another early and influential mythology effort, the Wong and Morgan-written episode "[[E.B.E.]]" (for "extraterrestrial biological entity," with Mulder and Scully tracking another crashed UFO led by [[Deep Throat (The X-Files)|Deep Throat]]), did almost as poorly; it was the fourth least watched episode of the series overall until its final, ninth season.<ref name="RATINGS">X-Files Nielsen ratings 1993-2002. [http://x-files.host.sk/nielsens.php]</ref>

Carter and his writers were mostly left to their own devices because FOX was concentrating on ''[[The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.]]'' and other shows considered more commercially promising at the time, but the crew ran into early opposition on some key episodes, among them "[[Beyond the Sea (The X-Files)|Beyond the Sea]]",<ref name="xwr"/> "E.B.E.", and the popular "[[Ice (The X-Files)|Ice]]".<ref name="MWNG">Stevens, Kevin. "Space Cadets Glen Morgan and James Wong reflect on their X tenure." ''Sci-Fi Universe'' magazine, October 1995. [http://www.morganandwongonline.com/xmen.htm]</ref> According to Carter, "the issue of closure has been an ongoing dialogue with the network, because we've always resisted wrapping up each episode with a neat little bow at the end. You can't do that... because pretending to explain the unexplainable is ridiculous and our audience is too smart for that." Eventually FOX backed down and it was decided "X-File stories would not have forced plot resolutions, but would conclude with some emotional resolution."<ref name="INT CARTER"/>

[[Image:Toomsx.jpg|thumb|right|<small>Doug Hutchinson as [[Eugene Victor Tooms]] in "Squeeze," the first of many "[[List of MOTW characters|Monster-of-the-week]]" episodes.</small>]]

Morgan and Wong's early influence on ''X-Files'' mythology led to their introduction of popular [[List of recurring characters from The X-Files|secondary characters]] who would continue for years in episodes written by others, such as the Scully family - Dana's father William ([[Don Davis]]), mother Margaret ([[Sheila Larken]]) and sister Melissa ([[Melinda McGraw]]) - as well as [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]]-buff trio [[The Lone Gunmen]],<ref name="SALON">Stark, Jeff. Interview with Chris Carter, 2001. [http://archive.salon.com/ent/tv/int/2001/03/13/carter/print.html]</ref> named after the [[Warren Commission]]'s disputed [[lone gunman theory|theory]] on the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]].

However, the duo's first episode for ''The X-Files'' was only the third aired, "[[Squeeze (The X-Files)|Squeeze]]", and it was not a part of the mythology. The episode instead featured [[Eugene Victor Tooms]], an elastic, [[liver]]-eating [[mutant]] [[serial killer]] who emerged from [[hibernation]] every 30 years. After the first two episodes and the show's marketing had dealt explicitly with [[alien abductions]] and conspiracy theories, the writing staff wanted to broaden the concept of ''The X-Files'' (indeed, executives had initially rejected Carter's idea for a series centered only around aliens, conspiracies and UFOs, as they already had one at the time, ''[[Sightings]]''<ref name="mill"/>). "Squeeze" became the template for the [[paranormal]] "[[List of MOTW characters|Monster-of-the-Week]]" episodes that would be a mainstay of the series over the next nine years. Wong and Morgan followed it up with a direct sequel, "[[Tooms]]", later in the season, one of the only times a monster returned in a later episode. "Tooms" was also the episode where the writers gave the Cigarette Smoking Man his first lines, and introduced FBI Assistant Director [[Walter Skinner]], Mulder and Scully's boss (played by [[Mitch Pileggi]]), who was to have a central supporting role in the series until its end.

Initially, ''The X-Files'' was fighting for its life in the ratings. As a result, there was no long-term plan or "bible" from the start to guide writers,<ref>[http://www.scifi.com/xfiles/chris2.html The Dominion - An Interview with Chris Carter]</ref> simply a guideline from Chris Carter that each episode should take place "within the realm of extreme possibility".<ref name="cyber">John Winston. 1993 Cyberspace Vanguard Magazine interview with Chris Carter. [http://www.skepticfiles.org/skeptic/x-filesj.htm]</ref> The show's first season thus featured numerous stand-alone stories involving monsters, and also aliens and government cover-ups of diverse types, with no apparent consistency<U+2014>such as the [[Arctic]] space worms in "Ice", based on ''[[The Thing]]'', and the conspiracy of [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] twins in "[[Eve (The X-Files)|Eve]]," both among Carter's favorite episodes.<ref name="INT CARTER"/> Carter himself wrote "[[Space (The X-Files)|Space]]", a low-budget affair about the manifestation of an alien "ghost" in the [[NASA]] [[Space Shuttle program|space shuttle program]], which was subject to cost overruns and became the most expensive of the first season;<ref>Anna Johns, review of "Space" [http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/07/30/the-x-files-space/]</ref> he later disavowed as one of the worst hours ever produced for the show.<ref name="transcr"/> According to Glen Morgan, the writers were inspired by a glowing ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' review noting the show's exploration of "suburban paranoia", and planned for more thematic unity in the second season: "the whole year was to be about the [[little green men]] that you and I create for ourselves... because there<U+2019>re not nuclear missiles pointed at our heads, you can<U+2019>t consolidate your fears there anymore."<ref name="MWNG"/> However, the plan fell through quickly due to the "controlled chaos" and pressure of the network TV schedule.

But by the end of the first season, Carter and his staff had come up with many of the general concepts of the mythology that would last throughout all nine seasons, whose outlines first appeared in Carter's [[Edgar Award]]-nominated [[season finale]] "[[The Erlenmeyer Flask]]", written in early [[1994 in television|1994]] before he knew whether the show was going to be canceled.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} The X-Files are closed in the episode, and it ends with a shot mirroring the end of the pilot. The finale was the first episode directed by R. W. Goodwin, a senior producer (as well as husband of Sheila Larken, who played Scully's mother on the show) who went on to direct every season opening and closing episode for the next four years in Vancouver.

To much relief from fans, ''The X-Files'' was picked up for a second year, despite finishing 102 out of 118 shows in the U.S. Nielsen ratings.<ref name="xffaq"/> It also received its first [[Emmy Awards|Emmy]] nod, for best [[title sequence]]. The [[electronic music|electronic]] [[theme song]] in the sequence, featuring eerie whistling sounds, was by [[Mark Snow]] and became very well known.

The show's mix of [[genre]]s, stressful schedule<U+2014>24 or 25 episodes per season to begin with<U+2014>and its format of shooting in different settings each week required a large and experienced [[technical crew]]. At least 300 in Vancouver were under the supervision of producer Goodwin, who called ''The X-Files'' "the most difficult show on television" and "the equivalent of making a feature film every eight days".<ref name="RWG">Strachan, Alex.

Carter often talked about the show's "cinematic look",<ref name="bartley"/> while directors themselves also said they were granted more freedom to express their own personal styles in ''The X-Files'' than on much other TV work.<ref name="adv"/>

However, as the series ended its first season, a problem had arisen for the producers: the impending [[pregnancy]] of Gillian Anderson, who played Dana Scully. Some network executives wanted the role recast, which Chris Carter refused to do.<ref name="BIO">Gillian Anderson biography. [http://www.gilliananderson.ws/about/bio1.shtml]</ref> Another problem arose for Carter, who was unable to finish his planned season opening extravaganza. Morgan and Wong were asked to come up with a lower-key replacement,<ref name="xwr"/> and their "[[Little Green Men (The X-Files)|Little Green Men]]" was nevertheless the first episode to actually show an alien (Mulder travels to [[SETI]]'s [[Arecibo Observatory]] in [[Puerto Rico]] to try to find evidence for his beliefs) and got the show's best ratings so far with a 19% audience share.<ref name="RATINGS"/> The early part of the second season solidified Mulder and Scully's close relationship, even as the two had been separated on drudgery assignments in different departments when the X-Files had been closed at the end of season one. Due to her pregnancy, Anderson was largely demobilized from active scenes with Duchovny, which matched her character's confinement to teaching medical students at [[FBI Academy|Quantico]]. During early episodes of season two, Scully is typically pictured only in closeup, at a desk, or conducting [[autopsies]] (one of her usual roles on ''The X-Files'', due to her training).

[[Image:Flukeman.jpg|thumb|right|<small>[[Flukeman]] in "The Host," played by future writer [[Darin Morgan]] under prosthetics. The episode, like several others, was inspired by classic [[science fiction]] B-movies.</small>]]

Mulder was increasingly hopeless, having had his prior [[informant]] taken away, and replaced by the far more reluctant Mr. [[X (The X-Files)|X]], played by [[Steven Williams]], who never revealed his true allegiances. Mulder is frequently seen conducting tedious [[wiretaps]] and chewing his favorite snack of [[sunflower seeds]] during this period. Carter's script "[[The Host (The X-Files)|The Host]]" tried to symbolize Mulder's frustration and loss of hope. In the episode, he is given what he thinks is a dead end assignment in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Jersey]], literally sifting through [[sewage]], which actually turns out to be a legitimate X-file<U+2014>a giant mutant [[Flukeman]] who breeds in post-[[Radioactive waste|nuclear waste]].

Notably, "Blood" was the first episode whose story credit went to [[Darin Morgan]], the actor who had portrayed Flukeman and the brother of writer/producer Glen Morgan. "Sleepless", on the other hand, was the second ''X-Files'' episode directed by [[Rob Bowman]] after "[[Gender Bender (The X-Files episode)|Gender Bender]]" the previous season. Bowman would become one of the most prolific ''X-Files'' staff members behind the scenes, directing dozens of episodes as well as the 1998 feature film.

[[Image:One Breath 2x08.jpg|thumb|left|<small>[[Dana Scully]] in "[[One Breath]]." The episode was the conclusion of a story arc in the second season devised to deal with star [[Gillian Anderson]]'s pregnancy.</small>]]

On screen, "Sleepless" introduced Agent [[Alex Krycek]] ([[Nicholas Lea]], a [[bit player]] in "Gender Bender") as Mulder's new FBI partner. Their partnership would last only into the next two episodes, "[[Duane Barry (episode)|Duane Barry]]" and "[[Ascension (The X-Files)|Ascension]]," which proved crucial to the fate of the series. Searching for a solution to the now acute problem of Anderson's pregnancy, Carter and his writers decided to have her abducted by [[Duane Barry]] ([[Steve Railsback]]), himself a likely alien abductee, in the episode of the same title. The October 1994 episode was both written and directed by Carter (his debut) and received several [[Emmy]] nominations the following year.<ref name="awards"/>

Anderson would not appear at all in the episode "[[3 (The X-Files)|3]]", and then mysteriously returned in Morgan and Wong's "[[One Breath]]" (directed by R. W. Goodwin), an episode which consistently scores among the highest in fan ratings.<ref>Assortment of unofficial reviews of "One Breath." [http://haebo.hihome.com/rv/breath.htm]</ref> Scully's abduction provoked an [[existential crisis]] in Mulder. Although the show left it up in the air for years who was directly responsible, aliens or the government or some combination of both, the earlier episode "Sleepless" had [[foreshadowing|foreshadowed]] the events with the Cigarette Smoking Man's declaration, of Scully, that "every problem has a solution". Scully was now seen to be firmly on Mulder's side in the larger conflicts, regardless of her original role as a [[debunker]] and her continued skepticism about Mulder's beliefs.

After Scully's health recovery (and the birth of Anderson's daughter Piper), Mulder and Scully returned to work on the re-opened X-Files, investigating cases ranging from [[Haiti]]an [[zombies]] at an exploitative [[U.S. military]] [[Internment|internment camp]] ("[[Fresh Bones]]") to animal abductions ("[[Fearful Symmetry (The X-Files)|Fearful Symmetry]]") and Christian [[exorcism]] ("[[The Calusari]]"). This period would see the show begin to appeal to a larger audience on Friday nights, often winning its timeslot<ref name="powers">Powers, William F. "'X-Files': Signs of Intelligent Life; Cult Favorite Gains a Following Among the Masses." ''The Washington Post'', September 17, 1995.</ref> as its Nielsen ratings rose to their highest peaks so far with the [[tongue-in-cheek]], occult-themed "[[Die Hand Die Verletzt]]" and the epic "[[Colony (The X-Files)|Colony]]"/"[[End Game (The X-Files)|End Game]]".<ref name="RATINGS"/> The latter was a two-part, [[sweeps]] episode introducing the [[Alien Bounty Hunter]], the idea of "[[colonist (The X-Files)|colonization]]", and Mulder's father (Bill, played by [[Peter Donat]]), mother (Teena, played by Rebecca Toolan; note, the show used alternate spellings of her name) and grown-up "sister".

[[Image:Die Hand Die Verletzt 2x14.jpg|thumb|right|<small>The [[occult]]-themed "Die Hand Die Verletzt" was the final script for the show by popular writers [[James Wong]] and [[Glen Morgan]], until their return in ''The X-Files''<nowiki>'</nowiki> fourth season.</small>]]

"Die Hand Die Verletzt" was Morgan and Wong's final ''X-Files'' script until the fourth season, as they departed to start their own series ''[[Space: Above and Beyond]]'', but at the same time there was new involvement behind the scenes. The episode also marked the ''X-Files'' directorial debut of [[Kim Manners]], who would stay with the show until its end and direct the largest number of episodes of the series. On "Colony", star David Duchovny collaborated with Chris Carter on the story, the first of Duchovny's involvements in writing for the show. [[Frank Spotnitz]], a new [[script editor|story editor]] brought on by Chris Carter, wrote "End Game", the second of the two-part episode; Spotnitz would be a producer and writer on ''The X-Files'' and other Ten Thirteen projects for years and had a key role in shaping the mythology. The middle of the second season also saw "[[Irresistible (The X-Files)|Irresistible]]", an episode directed by [[David Nutter]] and written by Chris Carter, which Carter later credited as a blueprint for his even darker show ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]''.<ref name="SALON"/> The episode was the first non-"paranormal" episode of ''The X-Files'', dealing with the trauma of investigating [[Donnie Pfaster]], a "[[necrophilia|death fetishist]]", so named to get past the FOX censors<ref>Patterson, Kevin. X-Files Season 2 reviews. [http://members.aol.com/KTPattersn/xf2.html]</ref> (a sequel, "Orison", was made in the seventh season).

During its second season, ''The X Files'' finished 64th out of 141 shows, a marked improvement from season one. Despite the less than spectacular ratings, the series had attracted enough fans to be classed as a "cult hit," particularly by Fox standards, making great gains among the 18-to-49 demographic sought by [[television commercial|advertisers]].<ref name="powers"/><ref name="cult"/> The show was chosen as Best Television Show of 1994 by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and named best drama by the [[Television Critics Association]], and it received seven Emmy nominations<U+2014>mostly in [[film technique|technical]] categories, but also its first nomination for best [[television drama|drama series]].<ref name="xffaq"/> In [[1995 in television|1995]], ''The X-Files'' won a [[Golden Globe Award]] for best television drama over more established series such as ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', ''[[Picket Fences]]'' and ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', a surprise given that this was its only nomination.<ref>Oldenburg, Ann. ''USA Today'', review of Golden Globe Awards. January 23, 1995.</ref>

The last weeks of season two brought more changes, beginning what some saw as ''The X-Files''<nowiki>'</nowiki> peak period.<ref name="wei">Wei, Eugene. Amazon.com editorial review, Season 3. [http://www.amazon.com/X-Files-Complete-Third-Season/dp/B000059TQ9]</ref> The [[Edgar Award]]-nominated episode, "[[Humbug (The X-Files)|Humbug]]", an unconventional stand-alone outing about [[sideshow]] performers or "circus freaks" in a [[Florida]] town, was the first full script by Darin Morgan. At the time it was also considered a risky experiment, the first outright [[comedy]] episode of the show. Gillian Anderson famously swallowed a real cricket in one [[ad-lib]]bed scene.<ref>Vitaris, Paula. "Making 'Humbug'", ''Cinefantastique'', October 1995. [http://www.morganandwongonline.com/paula6.htm]</ref> Eventual senior writer Vince Gilligan also offered his first episode, the darker sci-fi "[[Soft Light (The X-Files)|Soft Light]]", guest starring [[Tony Shalhoub]] as a remorseful [[particle physics|physicist]] whose shadow kills people. 

Season two ended in May 1995 with "[[Anasazi (The X-Files)|Anasazi]]" (co-scripted by Carter with David Duchovny) which attracted widespread attention with its [[cliffhanger]] ending<ref name="powers"/> putting the future of the series up in the air. In the episode, Mulder and Scully were contacted by a [[computer hacker]], apparently the erstwhile fourth member of The Lone Gunmen, ultimately drawing them and their families further into the targets of the conspiracy. Now-[[free agent]] Alex Krycek also made his first reappearance since "Ascension". The episode began a three-part arc, the show's most ambitious mythology episodes so far, extending into the third season, and centering around [[Navajo]] former [[code talkers]] such as the character of Albert Hosteen (played by [[Floyd Red Crow Westerman]]), who says "nothing disappears without a trace", a line repeated by the Cigarette Smoking Man in another context.<ref name="code">Hersey, Eleanor.

[[Image:Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man 4x07.jpg|thumb|left|<small>The [[Syndicate (The X-Files)|Syndicate]] and its mysterious member the [[Cigarette Smoking Man]], played by [[William B. Davis]], became increasingly important to ''X-Files'' "mythology" as the show progressed.</small>]]

===Seasons 3 &ndash; 5 (1995-1998)===
{{spoiler}}
Continuing from "Anasazi", the episodes "[[The Blessing Way (The X-Files)|The Blessing Way]]" and "[[Paper Clip (The X-Files episode)|Paper Clip]]" opened the third season, bringing in the involvement of former [[Nazi]] scientists, formally introducing leading conspiracy member the [[Well-Manicured Man]] (played by British actor [[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]]), and containing revelations and events involving both Mulder and Scully's families. "The Blessing Way" was the most successful ''X-Files'' episode thus far in the Nielsen TV ratings, which were increasing steadily.<ref name="RATINGS"/>

The third season confirmed the existence of [[extraterrestrial life]] within the show<ref>Review of "The Blessing Way" and "Paper Clip". [http://www.munchkyn.com/xf-rvws/paperclip.html]</ref> and suggested that a shadowy, international sub-governmental consortium known as the [[Syndicate (X-Files)|Syndicate]]<U+2014>one of the members being the [[Cigarette Smoking Man]]<U+2014>were in co-operation with these aliens, in order to allow them to colonize Earth. This would be achieved via use of the so-called [[black oil]], introduced late in the season in the two-part "[[Piper Maru]]"/"[[Apocrypha (The X-Files)|Apocrypha]]", along with another reappearance by homme fatale [[Alex Krycek]], played by [[Nicholas Lea]]. However, the season's other main mythology episodes "[[Nisei (The X-Files)|Nisei]]" and "[[731 (The X-Files)|731]]", in which Scully confronted her own abduction experience while Mulder investigated the role of [[WWII]]-era [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] scientists from [[Unit 731]], continued to call some of these conclusions into question. Series creator Carter began to receive criticism for posing as many questions as answers in the mythology, while the mythology episodes were also praised for their increasingly [[Hollywood]]-like [[production values]].<ref>Uhlich, Keith. review of "Mythology: Black Oil" DVD, ''Slant Magazine'', 2005. [http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/dvd_review.asp?ID=720]</ref> "Nisei" received two [[Emmy Award]]s for its [[sound editing]] and [[sound mixing|mixing]].

[[Image:Nisei_3x09.jpg|thumb|right|<small>

Season three's "[[Nisei (The X-Files)|Nisei]]" began a story arc with Mulder investigating an [[alien autopsy]] tape, and Scully confronting the possible effects of her abduction, which would play out in the following two seasons.</small>]]

Season three was noted for its wide variety of "monster of the week" episodes. "[[Pusher (The X-Files)|Pusher]]", the second effort by writer Vince Gilligan, depicted the cold blooded [[Robert Patrick Modell]], a man who could mentally "push" people into doing his will (a sequel, "[[Kitsunegari]]", came two years later in the fifth season). Simultaneously, the show continued to yield dark efforts like "[[The Walk (The X-Files)|The Walk]]" (about a mysterious force killing generals in a veterans hospital, and the first outing for longtime ''X-Files'' writer John Shiban), "[[Oubliette (The X-Files)|Oubliette]]" (about a metaphysical connection between a recently kidnapped girl and another woman) and "[[Grotesque (The X-Files)|Grotesque]]" (about Mulder's descent into the world of a gargoyle-possessed killer, written by Howard Gordon and recipient of an Emmy for John Bartley's [[cinematography]]), while for the first time [[self-reflexive]] episodes also became a more frequent occurrence.

Behind the scenes, [[Darin Morgan]] continued his involvement with the show, becoming ''The X-Files''<nowiki>'</nowiki> most critically acclaimed writer and helping to break a pattern of establishment ignorance of [[genre fiction|genre]] television.<ref>"Darin Morgan, The X-Files' Leading Genre Emmy winner." ''Cinefantastique'' [http://www.morganandwongonline.com/paula1.htm]</ref> Despite intense perfectionism and having been unsatisfied with his well-received prior effort "Humbug",<ref name="darin"/> Morgan managed in addition to serving as a [[script editor]] in season three, to turn in three [[dark comedy]] episodes which were considered quite original for the show. The first of these, "[[Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose]]," concerned a [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] [[insurance]] salesman (played by [[Peter Boyle]]) who could predict death. It won Emmys for best writing and for guest actor Boyle, and comes in very high in fan polls of favorite episodes.<ref>Global Episode Opinion Survey. [http://www.geos.tv/index.php/statistics/txf/053]</ref> "[[War of the Coprophages]]" was Morgan's parody/tribute to [[H.G. Wells]]/[[Orson Welles]]' ''[[War of the Worlds]]'', this time with an infestation of [[cockroach]]es driving a town to hysteria, and it also mocked the sexual tension between Mulder and Scully by introducing attractive [[entomologist]] Dr. Bambi Berenbaum. A similar technique was also used in Chris Carter's own "[[Syzygy (The X-Files)|Syzygy]]" episode, only one week later, leading to a comedy overdose for some viewers.<ref>Sarah Stegall review of "Syzygy" [http://www.munchkyn.com/xf-rvws/syzygy.html]</ref>

[http://www.morganandwongonline.com/darin2.html]</ref></small>]]

Morgan's third effort of the season, and his final episode as a writer of ''The X-Files''<U+2014>out of only four total<U+2014>was the [[postmodern]] "[[Jose Chung's "From Outer Space"|Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space']]", which presented multiple [[perspective (cognitive)|perspectives]] as in [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Rashomon]]'', and made fun of the X-Files mythology itself while remaining internally consistent with it. Graeme Murray and Shirley Inget were nominated for an Emmy for art direction on the episode. (Morgan would later write a sequel also involving the writer [[Jose Chung]], played by [[Charles Nelson Reilly]], for Chris Carter's series ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'' in 1998.)

In spring of [[1996 in television|1996]], ''The X-Files'' began to achieve wide recognition. In addition to its eight Emmy nominations for its third season, of which it won five, it was awarded a [[George Foster Peabody Award]] for excellence in television broadcasting. Both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were nominated for [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]] for the first time; Anderson won. Both actors were also nominated for [[Golden Globe Awards]]. Guest stars in season 3 included [[Jesse Ventura]] and [[Alex Trebek]] (both "[[Men in Black (The X-Files)|men in black]]" in "Jose Chung's"), [[Giovanni Ribisi]] and [[Jack Black]] (in "[[D.P.O.]]", about a young man who can control [[lightning]]), [[Lucy Liu]] and [[B.D. Wong]] (in "[[Hell Money]]", about mysterious and deadly occurrences in the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] immigrant community), [[JT Walsh]] (in "[[The List (The X-Files)|The List]]", the second episode both written and directed by Chris Carter, about the reincarnation of a [[death row]] prisoner), and [[R. Lee Ermey]] (in "[[Revelations (The X-Files)|Revelations]]", about a [[stigmatic]] boy, the first of several episodes in the series to deal directly with Scully's [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] faith). Black, Ribisi and Liu were not widely known at the time they appeared on ''The X-Files''. [[Dave Grohl]] also had a [[cameo]] in the episode "Pusher"; his [[rock music|rock]] band the [[Foo Fighters]] were fans of the show, and contributed songs to the compilation soundtrack album ''[[Songs in the Key of X]]'', released that spring, and to ''The X-Files'' movie two years later (see [[#Pop culture|below]] for other pop culture inspirations).

The final part of the season brought the episode "[[Avatar (The X-Files)|Avatar]]" (the first episode centered mostly around [[Mitch Pileggi]]'s Assistant Director [[Walter Skinner]], who was beginning to be punished by superiors for his reluctant efforts on behalf of Mulder and Scully), "[[Quagmire (The X-Files)|Quagmire]]" (about a [[lake monster]]; the famous "conversation on the rock" between Mulder and Scully was added by script editor Darin Morgan as his last contribution<ref>Morgan and Wong Online, facts about "Quagmire." [http://www.morganandwongonline.com/quagmire.html]</ref>), "[[Wetwired]]" (a semi-mythology episode involving Mr. [[X (The X-Files)|X]] and a possible conspiracy to send [[subliminal messages]] of violence in TV reception), and season finale "[[Talitha Cumi (The X-Files)|Talitha Cumi]]", introducing [[Jeremiah Smith]] (played by [[Roy Thinnes]]), apparently an alien with healing powers. The finale had a complex plot, tying back to Mulder's mother's past with the Cigarette Smoking Man and to the future foreseen by Smith and the [[Alien Bounty Hunter]] (played by [[Brian Thompson]]) trying to kill him. One scene was directly modeled by writers Chris Carter and David Duchovny on "[[The Grand Inquisitor]]" chapter from [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''.<ref name="DUCHOVNY"/> The episode was again a [[cliffhanger]] "to be continued" in the next season.

The next season, four, again began with ''The X-Files''<nowiki>'</nowiki> highest ratings success to that point, with "[[Herrenvolk (The X-Files)|Herrenvolk]]".<ref name="RATINGS"/> The [[season premiere]] introduced several new elements to the conspiracy: "[[killer bees]]" designed to unleash [[smallpox]], [[clones]] and alien [[hybrid]]s, [[United Nations]] [[Diplomatic rank|Special Representative]] [[Marita Covarrubias]] (played by [[Laurie Holden]]), and the removal of a previous important character. Covarrubias became an informer to Mulder and Scully in several episodes in the season, such as "[[Teliko (The X-Files episode)|Teliko]]" and "[[Unrequited (The X-Files episode)|Unrequited]]." However it was the [[horror fiction|horror]] episode "[[Home (The X-Files)|Home]]," signaling the return of Morgan and Wong as writers after their canceled ''Space: Above and Beyond'', that was most noticed. "Home" told the story of an [[inbreeding|inbred]] family of murderers in rural [[Pennsylvania]], with references to ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' and grisly violence contrasted with calm, becoming a hit with many fans ("X-Philes") and dividing others.<ref name="first">Cinefantastique, Oct. 1997 (part 1) [http://www.morganandwongonline.com/paula8.htm]</ref> [[FOX]]'s [[Standards and Practices]] department granted it a rare [[TV-MA]] "Parental Advisory" rating and refused to ever air it again,<ref>Morgan and Wong Online, information about the episode "Home."

[[Image:Unruhe 4x02.jpg|thumb|left|<small>"Unruhe," about a deranged man who performs "[[trans-orbital lobotomy|icepick lobotomies]]" to cure women of their "unrest," was one of many dark episodes in season 4, and the first episode to air in ''The X-Files''<nowiki>'</nowiki> new Sunday night time.</small>]]

Two major changes occurred behind the scenes in the autumn of [[1996]], during the early part of the fourth season. Chris Carter's new series ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'', also produced in Vancouver, debuted on Friday nights. As a result, ''The X-Files'' was moved from Friday night to Sunday, seen as a key to better ratings success, although Carter was initially wary and the decision was controversial with some of the show's devoted audience.<ref>Discussion from alt.tv.x-files news group, 1996. [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.tv.x-files/browse_thread/thread/3a5bea2b4d5cfc4b/3a0fc6423c8bed68]</ref> The first episode to air in the new time period was "[[Unruhe]]", written by Vince Gilligan and directed by [[Rob Bowman]]. It was one of the series' darkest episodes, dealing with a man (played by [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]]) who [[lobotomy|lobotomizes]] women and can project his fantasies in "thought photography". Gilligan also wrote "[[Paper Hearts]]", an emotional episode for Mulder, twisting his memories of his [[Samantha Mulder|sister]]'s disappearance with a case involving an unrepentant child killer.

Wong and Morgan contributed their own, possibly non-[[canon (fiction)|canon]] addition to the mythology,<ref name="musings"/> "[[Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man]]", which referenced [[Shakespearian]] [[Henry IV, Part 1|history]], tied ''The X-Files'' to real life [[conspiracy theories]] about the [[JFK]] and [[MLK]] assassinations and was the first episode in which neither Mulder or Scully appears on screen (except in [[flashback]]). [[Chris Owens]], later to play other roles for the show, first appeared in this episode as the young CSM. The action-oriented "[[Tunguska (The X-Files)|Tunguska]]" and "[[Terma (The X-Files)|Terma]]" were the more traditional mythology episodes for the autumn [[sweeps]] period, sending Mulder and Krycek to a Russian [[gulag]] and involving the black oil and the Syndicate closely. ''X-Files'' ratings by the middle of the fourth season were as high as they had ever been,<ref name="RATINGS"/> and by autumn 1996 it was the FOX network's most popular show.<ref name="details"/>

[[Image:Terma 4x10.jpg|thumb|right|<small>Renegade agent [[Alex Krycek]], played by [[Nicholas Lea]], was central to the ''X-Files'' mythology, such as in the two-part "Tunguska" and "Terma" episodes set partly in [[Russia]].</small>]]

Many episodes of the fourth season were [[characterization|character driven]], such as "[[The Field Where I Died]]" and "[[Demons (The X-Files)|Demons]]," both about Mulder trying to recover his past, or [[Reincarnation|past lives]]. "[[Never Again (The X-Files)|Never Again]]", Morgan and Wong's final episode of the series, centered on Scully's personal life. [[Jodie Foster]] provided the voice of a tattoo. It had originally been planned as a collaboration with director [[Quentin Tarantino]],<ref name="last"/> but Tarantino was not allowed to work in network television because he was not a member of the [[Directors Guild of America]].<ref name="GUILD">{{citeweb|url = http://www.slate.com/id/2116501|title = Slate: Why not quit the Directors Guild?|author = Daniel Engber|date = 2005-04-08|accessdate = 2007-01-12}}</ref> The episode was ultimately directed by Rob Bowman, with an homage to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Frenzy]]''. FOX had attained rights to broadcast [[Super Bowl XXXI]] in January [[1997 in television|1997]] and planned to showcase ''The X-Files'' in the premier post-game slot. As a result, "Never Again" was bumped to the next week, and "[[Leonard Betts]]", a stylish and gory monster-of-the-week episode about an [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]] (played by [[Paul McCrane]]) who was [[decapitation|decapitated]] and could [[regeneration (biology)|regrow]] his body, received the coveted spot (episodes of ''The X-Files'' were often aired slightly out of production order). "Leonard Betts" became the all time most-watched ''X-Files'' episode, with 17.2 Nielsen rating and 29% audience share.<ref name="RATINGS"/> It was also the first episode to be written by the team of Vince Gilligan, John Shiban and Frank Spotnitz, who were responsible for many episodes during the show's middle-to-late era.

The air date of "Leonard Betts" became relevant because the final scenes of the episode were central to the ongoing [[story arc|mytharc]] of the show and led directly into the events of "[[Memento Mori (The X-Files)|Memento Mori]]", in which it is revealed that Dana Scully has contracted terminal [[brain cancer]]. When originally aired, however, the episode "Never Again" came between these, implying Scully's behavior in that episode was a result of her diagnosis; Gillian Anderson said she would have played the role completely differently if that had been the case.<ref name="last">Cinefantastique, Oct. 1997 (part 3) [http://www.morganandwongonline.com/paula14.htm]</ref> Nevertheless, Anderson's performances during the fourth season "cancer arc" were praised. She won an Emmy for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress - Drama Series|Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series]] in 1997, as well as her second straight [[Screen Actors Guild]] award and a [[Golden Globe]]. "Memento Mori" relied on extended emotional [[voiceover]]s, a technique that had become increasingly common in the show over the years, as Scully came to grips with her illness while simultaneously investigating its origins, leading back to her own abduction. Mulder, Walter Skinner and the Cigarette Smoking Man all became dramatically involved, which played out in the later episode "[[Zero Sum (The X-Files episode)|Zero Sum]]", one of the few episodes of the show not to feature Anderson's involvement, although the events were driven by Scully's worsening condition, as well as the Syndicate's plans for unleashing killer bees.

[[Image:Redux II 5x03.jpg|thumb|left|<small>[[Dana Scully]] contracted cancer in season four, an acting challenge for [[Gillian Anderson]], who won an [[Emmy]] for the role in 1997. Her illness was central to "[[Memento Mori (The X-Files)|Memento Mori]]" and was resolved in the "[[Redux (The X-Files)|Redux]]" episodes, beginning the fifth season.</small>]]

Once Scully had contracted cancer, she continued to work in her former capacity as Mulder's partner investigating X-Files, apparently debilitated only by occasional [[nosebleeds]], though the issue of mortality was again addressed in "[[Elegy (The X-Files)|Elegy]]" late in the season. In the intervening time, notable episodes included the two-part "[[Tempus Fugit (The X-Files episode)|Tempus Fugit]]" and "[[Max (The X-Files episode)|Max]]", in which Max Fenig from season one's "Fallen Angel" returned briefly as the agents investigated mysterious "lost time" in a deadly [[plane crash]], loosely modeled on [[TWA Flight 800]].

Amidst what was considered the show's darkest year, "[[Small Potatoes (The X-Files episode)|Small Potatoes]]" provided a lighter tone.<ref>Review of "Small Potatoes." [http://www.entil2001.com/series/x-files/reviews/season4/4-20.html]</ref> The episode was written by Vince Gilligan, and featured departed ''X-Files'' writer and former Flukeman Darin Morgan in the role of Eddie Van Blundht, a shape-shifting self-described "loser" who becomes the focus of Scully and Mulder's investigation of a [[West Virginia]] town where children are being born with tails. The final scenes of the episode provided "[[shipping (fandom)|shippers]]" with the sight of "Mulder" and Scully finally together, the first of many such jokes by the writers in later seasons. Season 4 ended with "[[Gethsemane (The X-Files)|Gethsemane]]," a resolution which appeared to leave one main character near death and kill off the other one, as well as turning his entire belief system into a house of cards.

However, when season 5 opened, to the show's best numbers ever<ref name="RATINGS"/> (with the exception of "Leonard Betts"), it turned out Fox Mulder was still alive, having gone into hiding after becoming involved with Michael Kritschgau, a renegade [[Department of Defense]] employee. The continuation of the three-part arc with "[[Redux (The X-Files)|Redux]]" and "[[Redux II (The X-Files episode)|Redux II]]" brought Scully's [[metastasizing]] cancer to the fore, as Mulder continued to question his own ideas about aliens and government conspiracies, while working to find a cure to a disease he believes the government gave Scully. Scully is finally cured, though it's unclear what has caused the intervention, and what sacrifices have been made for the end. Skinner's loyalties are in question, and the Cigarette Smoking Man is seemingly put out of commission by the Syndicate.

These events were soon followed by Chris Carter's "[[The Post-Modern Prometheus]]", which he both wrote and directed. It was the show's only episode filmed entirely in [[black-and-white]], a retelling of the story of ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (subtitled by author [[Mary Shelley]], ''The Modern Prometheus''), mixed with allusions to ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', ''[[The Jerry Springer Show|Jerry Springer]]'', [[comic books]], [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[The Elephant Man]]'', and [[Cher]]. Carter earned his second [[Directors Guild of America|DGA]] nomination for his work. A few months earlier in 1997, ''The X-Files'' had received its largest awards recognition yet for its fourth season, with 12 Emmy nominations including best drama series, [[sound mixing]], [[makeup]], [[composer|music]], [[television director|directing]], [[screenwriting|writing]], two nominations for [[film editing|editing]], and wins for [[sound editing]], [[art direction]], and Anderson. Duchovny was also nominated at both this event and at the Golden Globes, where along with Anderson's win, he won best actor in a [[Television drama series|TV drama]] and the show itself won that category for a second year<U+2014>taking all three top awards. ''The X-Files'' also won a second [[Saturn Award]] for best genre television series, and Anderson won for best actress; these awards were given by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror Films.<ref name="awards"/>

[[Image:Spender.png|thumb|right|<small>[[Jeffrey Spender]] ([[Chris Owens]]) was a new character in season 5. Owens also played "The Great Mutato" in Chris Carter's "Post-Modern Prometheus," a black-and-white ''[[Frankenstein]]'' adaptation.</small>]]

Chris Carter's contract with FOX ran through the fifth season,<ref name="xffaq"/> and he and the stars had originally preferred to stop there, turning ''The X-Files'' into a series of films; but the show was such a hit that FOX was intent to continue it on TV in some form, and Carter was convinced to sign a new contract, retaining creative control.<ref name="carter">Review of "Redux II". [http://www.entil2001.com/series/x-files/reviews/season5/5-2.html]</ref> In a very rare move for a show still in production,<ref name="ST JAMES"/> a [[feature film]] of ''The X-Files'' had been planned by Carter ever since the show achieved commercial success in season two.<ref name="transcr"/> The movie's scripts were printed in red ink to ensure secrecy,<ref name="tvg">Ceron, Daniel Howard. "Great Expectations", TV Guide, Nov 15-21, 1997. [http://www.gilliananderson.ws/transcripts/96_97/97tvg.shtml]</ref> and it was largely filmed in [[California]] between season four's "Gethsemane" and season five's resumption of the plot with "Redux", pushing back the debut date for the season to November 1997 and resulting in the fifth being (until the ninth) the shortest season, only 20 episodes.<ref name="spotnitz">Frank Spotnitz interview. [http://www.scifi.com/xfiles/frank.html]</ref>

As a result, several episodes in season five featured either Scully or Mulder at the expense of the other, to make time for personal projects or re-shoots on the film throughout the season (both stars were now reportedly receiving the same pay, $100,000 per episode<ref name="tvg"/>). "[[Christmas Carol (The X-Files)|Christmas Carol]]" and "[[Emily (The X-Files)|Emily]]", written by the team of Spotnitz, Gilligan and Shiban, were the first mythology episodes mostly centered around Scully. In "Christmas Carol", she receives further information about her abduction, coinciding with the mysterious arrival of a young child into her life.

Another result was that two episodes of the season, "[[Unusual Suspects]]" and "Travelers", focused on the origins of [[The Lone Gunmen]] in 1989 and the origin of the X-File cases at the [[FBI]] during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]] in the 1950s, respectively. Duchovny appears only briefly in the episodes, and Anderson is in neither. [[Richard Belzer]] guest starred in "Unusual Suspects," playing Detective [[John Munch]] of ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street|Homicide]]'' and many other series. "Unusual Suspects" was later followed up in the sixth season with "Three of a Kind," and these episodes about Lone Gunmen [[John Fitzgerald Byers]] ([[Bruce Harwood]]), [[Richard Langly|Richard "Ringo" Langly]] ([[Dean Haglund]]), and [[Melvin Frohike]] ([[Tom Braidwood]]) later became the basis for a short-lived [[The Lone Gunmen (TV Series)|spinoff]] in 2001.

Early in [[1998 in television|1998]], the show, largely written by a staff of regulars, aired its first episodes by well known guest writers. [[Stephen King]] contributed "[[Chinga]]", about a demonic doll, which was co-written with Chris Carter and featured Scully investigating the case, between tongue-in-cheek phone conversations with Mulder. The episode, directed by Kim Manners, received mixed reviews. Next up was "[[William Gibson's "The X-Files" episodes|Kill Switch]]", written by [[cyberpunk]] author [[William Gibson]] along with [[Tom Maddox]]. The episode covered issues of [[virtual reality]] and received better reception.<ref>[http://www.streettech.com/archives_Special/maddoxSpecial.html Tom Maddox chat transcript], March 3-9, 1998.</ref> Then an episode aired where both Mulder and Scully's diverging viewpoints on a [[vampire]] case were presented, and humorously contrasted. Vince Gilligan's "Bad Blood", another pairing with "Small Potatoes" director [[Cliff Bole]], was a fan favorite<ref name="chart">Chart of highest rated episodes from X-Files Ratings and Reviews, statistics project. [http://web.archive.org/web/20050830010736/xfiles.amaroq.com/chart.html web archive (site offline)]</ref> and featured [[Luke Wilson]] in a guest role as a young [[Texas]] sheriff with or without "buck teeth".

[[Image:Gibson sprawl.jpg|thumb|right|<small>Several famous authors contributed ''X-Files'' episodes in the fifth season. [[William Gibson]] wrote the [[artificial intelligence]] episode "[[William Gibson's "The X-Files" episodes|Kill Switch]]" along with [[Tom Maddox]], and [[Stephen King]] contributed "[[Chinga]]".</small>]]

In February, the fifth season continued a tradition of mythology episodes in [[sweeps]] month and aired the dramatic two-part episodes "Patient X" and "The Red and the Black", the latter of which was again directed by Carter. These dealt with the beginning of [[colonist (The X-Files)|colonization]], and introduced two new characters, [[Cassandra Spender]] (a chronic alien abductee, played by [[Veronica Cartwright]], who was nominated for two Emmys in the role) and her estranged son [[Jeffrey Spender]] (a colleague of Mulder and Scully at the FBI, played by [[Chris Owens]]). The episodes also juxtaposed Mulder's ongoing crisis of belief in the existence of aliens, with the machinations of the Syndicate and Scully's own personal experiences. Krycek and Covarrubias were involved, while the [[Cigarette Smoking Man]] continued to be largely out of the picture during the fifth season. Leading up to the end of the year, more monster of the week episodes were aired, including "Mind's Eye" (guest starring [[Lili Taylor]] as a blind woman suspected of murder, and written by season 5 story editor [[Tim Minear]]), "The Pine Bluff Variant" (about Mulder's involvement in a plot to spread deadly [[biological terrorism]], with tie-ins to the ongoing mythology) and "Folie a Deux" (about Mulder and Scully's investigation into a [[telemarketing]] employee who claimed his boss could turn into an insect).

David Duchovny had been unhappy with his geographical separation from his wife [[T<U+00E9>a Leoni]], as well as with climatic conditions in [[Vancouver]]. Gillian Anderson also wanted to return home to the United States,<ref name="Vanc">Strachan, Alex. "X-Files creator bids B.C. sad adieu." [[The Vancouver Sun|Vancouver Sun]], March 30, 1998. [http://www.mjq.net/xfiles/cc-farewell.htm]</ref> and Carter decided to move production to [[Los Angeles]] following the fifth season. The season ended in May 1998 with "The End", the final episode shot in Vancouver and the final episode with the involvement of many of the original crew members who had worked on the show for its previous five years, including director and producer R. W. Goodwin and his wife [[Sheila Larken]] (who played Margaret Scully and would later return briefly). "The End" introduced [[Diana Fowley]], a new character who had apparently once worked with Mulder on early X-Files, but it focused largely on the efforts of the Syndicate to get control of mind-reading [[chess]] prodigy Gibson Praise.

[[Image:Stanley Park 1999 Rain.jpg|thumb|left|<small>"The End" was the last episode to be filmed in rainy [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] (pictured), closing season 5. The show produced 117 episodes in [[Canada]] before moving to [[Los Angeles]] in its sixth season.</small>]] 

The X-Files were closed for a second time in this episode (following season 2). This set up the events of the movie, ''[[The X-Files (film)|The X-Files]]'', which had just completed post-production and was to open in theatres one month later. The show finished its fifth season with a season Nielsen average of 12.1, its all time peak viewership,<ref name="RATINGS"/> and an ''X-Files'' record of 16 Emmy nominations (winning two), in addition to winning the Golden Globe for best drama series for the third year in a row. Overall, seasons three to five appear to have marked the show's most popular and acclaimed period.

===Movie and Season 6 (1998-1999)===
{{spoiler}}
{{main|The X-Files (film)}}
[[Image:The X Files film.jpg|thumb|right|<small>''[[The X-Files (film)|The X-Files]]'' movie, also known as ''Fight the Future'', had a worldwide theatrical [[box office]] total of $189 million. The movie's production cost was close to $66 million,<ref name="bowman">Interview about ''Fight the Future'' with Rob Bowman. [http://www.scifi.com/xfiles/rob.html]</ref> and its advertising budget was similar.</small>]]
In summer [[1998]] the series produced a feature length [[motion picture]], ''[[The X Files (film)|The X-Files]]'', also known as ''The X Files: Fight the Future''. It was intended as a continuation of the season five finale "The End" (5x20), but was also meant to stand on its own.<ref name="spotnitz"/> The season six opener "The Beginning" picked up where the movie left off. (Although the events are supposed to occur between the fifth and sixth seasons, the majority of the film was actually shot in the break between the show's fourth and fifth seasons.)

The movie, written by [[Chris Carter]] and [[Frank Spotnitz]] and directed by series regular [[Rob Bowman]], was more [[action adventure|action]]-oriented than a typical episode, but it dealt with the central mythology and conspiracy of the show. In addition to [[Mulder]], [[Dana Scully|Scully]], [[Walter Skinner]] and the [[Cigarette Smoking Man]], it featured guest appearances by [[Martin Landau]], [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]], and [[Blythe Danner]] as characters that only appeared in the movie (though Mueller-Stahl's [[Conrad Strughold]] is later mentioned in the series). It also had the last ''X-Files'' appearance by John Neville as the [[Well-Manicured Man]]. [[Jeffrey Spender]], [[Diana Fowley]] and [[Gibson Praise]] do not appear in the film. The film had a strong domestic opening and got mostly positive reviews from critics, however, its box office dropped sharply after the first weekend. Although it failed to make a profit during theatrical release, due to a very high promotional budget,<ref>E Online news, 1998. [http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=d8f5136e-2107-4c67-9fd8-d70c6d59771a]</ref> ''The X-Files'' film was more successful internationally. Anderson and Duchovny both received equal pay for the film, unlike their original contracts for the series.<ref name="tvg"/>

Over the course of the previous two years, the show had built upon the [[story arc|mythology]] storylines that grew in complexity and prominence (and confusion, especially for new viewers<ref name="NYT"/>) as the show progressed. The loyalties of the Cigarette Smoking Man and [[Alex Krycek|Krycek]] were continually shifting and the influence of CSM appeared to be waning. Above all, the [[Syndicate (The X-Files)|Syndicate]]'s co-operation with the [[colonist (The X-Files)|colonizers]] was proven to be a ploy, as they were secretly attempting to develop a [[Purity Control|vaccine]] to the [[black oil]] (also known as "purity") which was shown to be an agent which would allow for the transportation of [[extraterrestrial|alien]] beings, and which would be spread through [[bees]] come the time for colonization. However, another alien faction was proven to exist, and these rebels opposed the colonists and the Syndicate for their co-operation. Consequently, in mid-season 6 "full disclosure" episodes "Two Fathers" and "One Son", the rebels destroyed the Syndicate.

[[Image:Syndicate008.jpg|thumb|right|<small>The Syndicate, or Consortium, "represents certain global interests," according to member the [[Well-Manicured Man]]. After impeding Mulder and Scully in the movie and successfully making an alien-human hybrid, [[Cassandra Spender]], the group was destroyed in season six.</small>]]

At the end of ''The X-Files'' movie, the X-Files had again been re-opened, however, Agents Spender and Fowley were assigned to them rather than Mulder and Scully, who were reassigned from Walter Skinner<U+2014>who continued to appear on the show, nevertheless<U+2014>to a new boss, Assistant Director [[Alvin Kersh]] (played by [[James Pickens, Jr.]]). Gibson Praise was dispatched in the first episode of season 6, "The Beginning" (which also posited a possible [[extraterrestrial|alien]] source for humanity), and Jeffrey Spender was also written out of the show during season 6, while [[Mimi Rogers]]' Diana Fowley continued to play a role and appeared quite close to the Cigarette Smoking Man. The latter character was finally given a name, CGB Spender, and an identity<U+2014>father of Jeffrey and ex-husband of Cassandra.

With the move to [[L.A.]] in season 6, many changes behind the scenes occurred, as much of the original ''X-Files'' crew was gone. New [[production designer]] Corey Kaplan, [[film editor|editor]] Lynne Willingham, writer David Amann, and director and [[television producer|producer]] Michael Watkins would stay on for several years. Bill Roe became the show's new [[director of photography]], and episodes generally had a drier, brighter look due to the sunshine and climate of [[California]], as compared with the rain, fog and [[temperate]] forests of [[Vancouver, Canada]]. Early in the sixth season, the producers took advantage of the new location, setting the show in parts of the country they had not been able to write episodes in previously.<ref name="dir">Hurwitz, Matt. "Directing ''The X-Files''", ''DGA Monthly'', March 2002. [http://www.dga.org/news/v26_6/feat_kimmanners.php3]</ref> For example, Vince Gilligan's "Drive" (about a man subject to an unexplained illness) was a frenetic action episode, unusual for ''The X-Files'',<ref>X-Files 6th Season Guide. [http://www.geocities.com/earl20xx/X61.html]</ref> not least due to its setting on roads in the stark desert of [[Nevada]]. The "Dreamland" two-parter was also set in Nevada, this time in the legendary [[Area 51]]. It marked another [[comedy]] outing for the show, in a season increasingly light in tone, with [[guest star]] [[Michael McKean]] playing [[man in black]] Morris Fletcher, who switches bodies with Fox Mulder during the course of the episodes. It is the only non-mythology two part episode of ''The X-Files''.

[[Image:Gillian anderson.jpg|thumb|left|<small>[[Gillian Anderson]] (pictured) and [[David Duchovny]] became more involved behind the scenes of ''The X-Files'', even as their characters' relationship remained as close and ambiguous as ever. Duchovny wrote and directed "The Unnatural" in the sixth season and "Hollywood A.D." in the seventh, while Anderson's "all things" appeared in season seven.</small>]]

The sixth season also explored the ever-deepening bond between Mulder and Scully. The episode "Triangle" was Chris Carter's fifth try at [[film director|directing]] as well as writing ''The X-Files''. With its ambitious [[mise-en-scene]] featuring [[tracking shot|continuous takes]] and [[split screen]]s, and its setting on an [[ocean liner]] on the eve of [[World War II]] (played by the ''[[HMS Queen Mary]]'' anchored in [[Long Beach, California]]), it was widely seen as a bid for an [[Emmy Award]], which Carter did not receive, though the episode was up for [[sound editing]]. "Triangle" concerned Mulder's rebellious trip to the [[Bermuda Triangle]] to investigate an X-File there, disobeying superiors such as Kersh, in parallel with Scully and [[The Lone Gunmen]]'s dogged efforts to locate him, contrasting this with [[time warp]] versions of all the main characters in [[September]] [[1939]], and ending with a pivotal "[[shipping (fandom)|shipper]]" moment while leaving both the preceding events and the agents' relationship ambiguous.<ref name="TRI"/> Whether they "should" or "should not" consummate their "[[platonic]]" love was a matter of immense debate among the fan community for years, and is still subject to scrutiny, since even after abundant hints Carter refuses to substantiate whether the two characters ever had sex.<ref name="study"/> Other episodes that season, such as "The Rain King", "Monday", "Field Trip", and Carter's "Milagro" and "How the Ghosts Stole Christmas" (guest starring [[Ed Asner]] and [[Lily Tomlin]]), also dealt primarily with romantic relationships and alternate realities, using these to comment on Mulder and Scully's status.<ref>Review of "Milagro". [http://www.angelfire.com/ga/wkb/xfmilagro.html]</ref>

Late in the season, David Duchovny<U+2014>who had a [[master's degree]] in [[English literature|English]] and considered a career as a writer before joining the cast<ref name="DUCHOVNY"/><U+2014>contributed his first solo ''X-Files'' script, "The Unnatural", which he also directed. It was about Josh "Ex" Exley, a [[baseball]]-loving alien who played in the [[Negro Leagues]] after the fabled [[Roswell UFO incident|Roswell]] crash in 1947. A baseball announcer in "The Unnatural" was voiced by famous [[L.A. Dodgers]] announcer [[Vin Scully]], Chris Carter's original inspiration for the name of Dana Scully.<ref>CNN. [http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Movies/9807/08/chris.carter/]</ref> The episode was also originally set to feature the involvement of [[Darren McGavin]], star of early ''X-Files'' inspiration ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]''. McGavin had to pull out due to illness,<ref name="DUCHOVNY">Paula Vitaris. "[http://www.morganandwongonline.com/paula16.htm David Duchovny on 'The Unnatural' and 'Hollywood AD', interview]," ''Cinefantastique'', April 2002.</ref> but he does appear as original X-File investigator Agent Arthur Dales in season five's "Travelers" and season six's "Agua Mala" (about Mulder and Scully's discovery of a dangerous water-based [[Organism|life form]] during a [[hurricane]] in Florida).

Some longtime fans were alienated by the show in season 6, due to the different tone taken by most stand-alone episodes after the move to L.A.<ref name="alienated">Parks, Jo-Ann.

[http://haebo.hihome.com/rv/begin.htm#Katie]</ref> Rather than adhering to the previous style of "monsters of the week", they were often romantic or gently humorous or both, such as "Arcadia", where Mulder and Scully pose as a married couple in a [[gated community]] in order to solve a case, or the darker, [[campy]] "Terms of Endearment", starring [[Bruce Campbell]] as a demon. Meanwhile, some felt there was no coherent plan to the mytharc, that Carter was "making it all up as he goes along".<ref name="alienated"/> The show ended season 6 with solid ratings, but its lowest average since season two, beginning a decline that would continue for the final three years of its run.<ref name="RATINGS"/> This may have been due to different competition on Sunday nights, or because viewers felt the show was burning out or even "[[jumping the shark]]"<ref>Documentation from Jumptheshark.com: The X-Files [http://www.jumptheshark.com/x/xfiles.htm]</ref> (the show would actually reference the concept in its episode "Jump the Shark" three years later). The show's producers acknowledged they had been trying to do something different from previous years in season six. ''The X-Files'' was nevertheless FOX's highest rated show that year,<ref name="latimes"/> and was nominated for eight Emmys in 1999, winning one for [[makeup]]. It was also nominated for [[SAG Awards]] for Anderson, Duchovny and [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Ensemble - Drama Series|Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble Cast]], recognizing Pileggi, Pickens, Owens and Davis' continuing contributions.

As compared with other seasons, relatively few mythology episodes were made during season 6, only "The Beginning", the stand-alone "S.R. 819" (in which Walter Skinner's health is compromised by a mysterious [[nanotechnology]] affliction as possible blackmail to force him to turn against Mulder and Scully), "Two Fathers" and "One Son", and the season finale "Biogenesis", the first of a three-part story continued into season 7, about Scully's investigation of an [[ancient astronauts|ancient UFO]] discovered off the coast of [[West Africa]] and effects on Mulder from it.

===Seasons 7 &ndash; 9 (1999-2002)===
{{spoiler}}

In November [[1999 in television|1999]], "The Sixth Extinction" and its second part "Amor Fati" continued the [[story arc]] begun in the previous year. New sixth season director [[Michael Watkins]] oversaw the latter episode, which was a writing collaboration between [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] and [[David Duchovny]], harkening back to the themes and characters of previous ''X-Files'' history<U+2014>"Anasazi/The Blessing Way/Paper Clip" and Carter's "Redux" trilogy<U+2014>as well as to ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]''.<ref>Stegall, Sarah. Review of "Biogenesis", "Sixth Extinction", and "Amor Fati". [http://www.munchkyn.com/xf-rvws/6thextinction.html]</ref> However, it was the lowest [[Nielsen ratings|rated]] season premiere since 1994's "Little Green Men".<ref name="RATINGS"/> Subsequent offerings like "Millennium" (a [[crossover episode|crossover]] with Carter's recently canceled [[Millennium (TV series)|other series]]), and Vince Gilligan's "Hungry" (a sardonic "[[List of MOTW characters|monster of the week]]" in which Mulder and Scully barely appeared) and "X-Cops" (an experimental merging with FOX's [[reality television|reality]] show ''[[COPS (TV series)|COPS]]''), did not substantially improve viewership.<ref name="RATINGS"/> "Millennium", however, as well as featuring [[Lance Henriksen]] reprising his role of Frank Black for the final time, also made waves for showing the first consensual mouth-to-mouth kiss of [[Fox Mulder|Mulder]] and [[Dana Scully|Scully]].<ref>"Millennium" episode reviews from fans. [http://haebo.hihome.com/rv/millenni.htm]</ref> The occasion was [[New Year]]'s [[2000 in television|2000]].

[[Image:Donniex2.jpg|thumb|left|<small>For season seven's "Orison", Nick Chinlund reprised his role of [[Donnie Pfaster]], the "escalating death fetishist" first seen in "[[Irresistible (The X-Files)|Irresistible]]".</small>]]

[[Nick Chinlund]] also reprised his role of [[Donnie Pfaster]] in "Orison", a sequel to season two's "[[Irresistible (The X-Files)|Irresistible]]", while [[Ricky Jay]] played a [[magician (illusion)|magician]] in "The Amazing Maleeni", which contrasted with the generally more emotional tone of season seven. Novelists [[Tom Maddox]] and [[William Gibson]] returned with a second episode, "[[William Gibson's "The X-Files" episodes|First Person Shooter]]", this time directed by Chris Carter. There were reports of friction between cast and crew, however. David Duchovny, who had filed a [[lawsuit]] with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] that also alleged Carter was paid "hush money" to approve an unfair [[TV syndication|syndication]] contract, was reputed to be bored with ''The X-Files'' a year after relocating. The show's production costs since the move from Vancouver<U+2014>typically over $3 million per episode<U+2014>were also a matter of concern to the network, as it both financed and distributed the show and could not pass off costs to itself without hurting the corporate bottom line.<ref name="latimes">Brownfield, Paul. "Exploring the Unknown: 'X-Files' Future." ''Los Angeles Times'', August 28, 1999. [http://duchovny.net/articles/lawsuit.htm]</ref>

Breaking the formula of standard stand-alone episodes were several efforts written and directed by the show's stars. [[Gillian Anderson]] directed her own script for the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] "all things", further exploring Scully's character. It was the first ''X-Files'' to be directed by a woman,<ref name="BIO"/> though the show had had several female writers for periods during seasons 2, 3 and 4 (Carter himself was subject to a harassment lawsuit over the supposed atmosphere that existed among the writing staff years earlier,<ref name="mill">Svetke, Benjamin. "The Next Files" interview with Carter. ''Entertainment Weekly'', October 18, 1996. [http://www.millenniumdesktop.co.uk/html/interviews/chris_carter_entertainment_weekly3.htm]</ref> which was dismissed). Duchovny followed up his prior episode "The Unnatural" with the over-the-top [[satire]], "Hollywood A.D." The title referenced both the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] scandal uncovered therein, and the prospect of [[Mitch Pileggi]]'s [[Walter Skinner|Assistant Director Skinner]] as a [[Hollywood]] player; the [[self-reflexive]] episode concerned Skinner's effort to get a blockbuster movie made about Mulder and Scully's X-Files investigations, but the "stars" playing the agents are actress [[T<U+00E9>a Leoni]], Duchovny's real life wife as Scully, and comedian [[Garry Shandling]] as Mulder. Finally, [[William B. Davis|William Davis]], known for his ongoing role as the [[Cigarette Smoking Man]], wrote an episode examining his character, called "En Ami". It was one of Davis' final appearances in the show.

"En Ami" was also director Rob Bowman's final episode for the show. Before the seventh season finale, longtime writer Vince Gilligan also got the chance to direct his first episode, "Je Souhaite" (about a reluctant [[genie]]), and Chris Carter turned in the dark [[slapstick]] "Fight Club", a return to Carter's roots in comedy. The episode, guest starring [[Kathy Griffin]], did not go over well,<ref>Autumn Tysko, review of "Fight Club". [http://www.geocities.com/area51/vault/1411/reviews/seventh/club.html]</ref> particularly so close to what fans expected would be final revelations to the mythology; it holds the record for all time lowest voted episode of the whole series in a survey of viewers.<ref name="chart"/>

[[Image:X-Pilot.jpg|thumb|right|<small>In 2000, the season finale "Requiem" returned [[Dana Scully|Scully]] and [[Fox Mulder|Mulder]] to the setting of the "[[Pilot (The X-Files)|Pilot]]" (pictured) of seven years earlier. When it completed shooting, the producers were unsure if they would come back for an eighth year.</small>]]

The final three seasons were a time of closure for ''The X-Files''. Characters within the show were written out, including the Cigarette Smoking Man and [[Teena Mulder|Mulder's mother]], and several plot threads were resolved, including the fate of Fox Mulder's sister [[Samantha Mulder|Samantha]], who had been a long running [[plot device]] within the show, in the episodes "[[Being and Time|Sein Und Zeit]]" and "Closure". After settling his contract dispute, David Duchovny quit full-time participation in the show after the seventh season.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1337685.stm</ref> This contributed to uncertainties over the likelihood of an eighth season. Carter and most fans felt the show was at its natural endpoint with Duchovny's departure, but it was decided Mulder would be [[alien abduction|abducted]] at the end of the seventh season, leaving things open for the actor's return in 11 episodes the following year.<ref>Elber, Lynn. "Fox Mulder 'Ready to Get Back to Work.'" Associated Press. 18 May 2000. [http://ww.space.com/sciencefiction/tv/xfiles_duchovny_000518_wg.html]</ref> Season finale "Requiem" was written by Chris Carter as a possible [[series finale]], but the show was again renewed by FOX, despite lower ratings.

For the next two years, Carter was offered incentives to continue the show, which he did despite reservations, concluding there were "more stories to tell."<ref name="SALON"/> Executive producer and screenwriter [[Frank Spotnitz]] was largely responsible, with Carter, for running the show in its final two years, introducing new central characters. With Duchovny's involvement reduced (and in anticipation of Anderson's possible absence in the future), the show's eighth season introduced two new X-Files agents, [[John Doggett]] and [[Monica Reyes]] (played by [[Robert Patrick]] and [[Annabeth Gish]], respectively). Doggett was initially the primary character with Anderson, playing off her in a now-reversed dynamic from ''The X-Files''<nowiki>'</nowiki> earliest seasons, with Scully the "believer" and Doggett the "skeptic", once again investigating [[paranormal]] monsters of the week. Carter, Spotnitz, John Shiban and Vince Gilligan continued to serve as writers, with Kim Manners frequently directing, but otherwise the behind the scenes staff experienced turnover.

[[Image:X-Files Season 9 Cast.jpg|thumb|left|<small>Main cast of Season 9.</small>]]

It was Chris Carter's belief that the series could continue for another ten years with new leads, and the opening credits were accordingly redesigned for the first time in season 9 to emphasize the new actors (along with Pileggi, who was finally listed). This was not to be the case, however, as over the course of the final two seasons, Doggett and Reyes did not provide the ratings boost the producers had hoped for. Following the launch and failure of [[spin-off (media)|spinoff]] show ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV Series)|The Lone Gunmen]]'', whose early [[2001 in television|2001]] debut episode had dealt humorously with an airplane being hijacked and flown into the [[World Trade Center]], writers were also finding it hard to deal with stock ''X-Files'' themes in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name="NYT"/> The show received meager Emmy attention in its final years, nevertheless picking up a nomination for Bill Roe's [[cinematography]] in "This is Not Happening", and a win for [[makeup]] in the stand-alone "Deadalive". Robert Patrick won a [[Saturn Award]] for [[Saturn Award for Best Actor on Television|Best Actor]], however, and the mythology continued to develop, with a new "super soldiers" concept, and the informer [[Knowle Rohrer]], who interacted with Doggett. Jeff Gulka's [[Gibson Praise]] and [[Chris Owens]]' [[Jeffrey Spender]] eventually made a return, as well as Scully's mother Margaret, played by Sheila Larken (who had not appeared since the show moved from Vancouver in season 5). The show also alluded to religious [[allegory]] in a story line about Scully's pregnancy.<ref name="NYT"/> It was a seeming reversal of earlier seasons' mythology, in which experiments that had given the character her cancer had also left Scully [[infertility|infertile]].

Duchovny returned over the eighth season for several dramatic episodes, and [[flashbacks]] were seen in the ninth. Duchovny also directed an episode. Anderson was nominated for her final [[Screen Actors Guild]] award as Dana Scully in 2001. The Mulder/Scully relationship by this point reflected what some "[[shipping (fandom)|shippers]]" had imagined for years, although others were dissatisfied or offended by the characterizations.<ref>Opinions for episode "William", X-Files ratings and reviews statistics [http://web.archive.org/web/20050425080709/xfiles.amaroq.com/9.17/review.html]</ref> In the end, the apparent result of the partnership was [[Baby William]], while the crew also offered a tribute to an Internet [[fan fiction]] writer who had passed away from cancer in 2001, creating the character of young FBI Agent [[Leyla Harrison]] (a self-professed admirer of Mulder and Scully) to honor her memory in the season 8 episode "Alone" and Season 9 episode "Scary Monsters."

[[Image:finale.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Anderson and Duchovny filming the finale in [[2002 in television|2002]].]]

''The X-Files'' completed its ninth and final season with the two-hour episode "[[The Truth (The X-Files episode)|The Truth]]", which reunited David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, and much of the original cast. It first aired on [[May 19]], [[2002]], finishing third in its [[timeslot]] in the [[Nielsen ratings]], with a slightly lower audience share than the original ''X-Files'' pilot episode.<ref name="RATINGS"/> The show ceased production at the end of the ninth season<U+2014>on a [[cliffhanger]], though Carter knew that this would be the final episode. Carter's [[Ten Thirteen Productions]] also went into hibernation, and actors, writers, producers and technical staff all moved on to other projects. The show's final Emmy nomination in 2002 went to composer [[Mark Snow]].<ref name="awards"/>

===Future of the show===
Plans for [[The X Files 2 (film)|another movie]] are announced periodically but have yet to come to fruition. While Carter, Duchovny and Anderson have expressed their desire for involvement, there is still no script and no official [[shooting schedule]]. According to Bowman, director of the first film, and producer Frank Spotnitz, the plot for a second film would most likely be a stand-alone story, rather than focus on the alien conspiracy storylines.<ref>
{{cite web| url = http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/709/709340p1.html| title = No Aliens for X-Files 2: The sequel is still on.| accessdate = 2006-06-10}}</ref> Although Bowman has commented about the film's status, and Spotnitz was apparently commissioned to write a script in 2006, recent comments by David Duchovny suggest there is "no script" yet for the film, and it is unknown whether Bowman and Spotnitz would reprise their directing and writing roles if a second film was made.

In early 2004, Duchovny stated his belief that the sequel would start shooting in 'the next year or so'.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.filmfodder.com/mt-weblog/archives/001026.shtml| title = X-Files 2 Has a Pulse|author = Unknown author|accessdate = 2006-10-21}}</ref> In January of 2005, Duchovny confirmed that a sequel was in the works and that it would be a "stand-alone horror film." In an article in ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]'' published on [[August 6]], 2006, David Duchovny said he still believed that there would be a sequel to the first X-Files movie, ''Fight the Future''. "We're all signed on," he said of the movie. "I think it could work very well as a sequel, an authentic franchise that will hold up<U+2014>much more so than ''Mission: Impossible''."<ref>
{{cite web| url = http://parade.com/articles/editions/2006/edition_08-06-2006/In_Step_With| title = PARADE Magazine | In Step With...David Duchovny| accessdate = 2006-08-06}}</ref>

One issue seen to be holding up production is a lawsuit filed in late 2005 by Chris Carter against [[20th Century Fox]] Television over [[TV syndication|syndication]] profits of the show,<ref name="LAWSUIT"/> which has only recently been resolved.<ref> [http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=20576 Exclusive: Scully Talks X-Files Sequel] </ref> 

In a 2006 posting on her website, Gillian Anderson stated that she was very much willing to take part in the project: ''"And as far as the X-F movie? I have no f****** clue. I think there's still a law suit, as far as I know the script has not been written, and as much as we all want it to take place as soon as possible, AND YES THAT INCLUDES ME, AND ALWAYS HAS, SO STOP WITH THE NONSENSE! It is out of my hands. Completely. Write to Fox guys, tell them to make it happen!"''<ref>

David Duchovny mentioned an ''X-Files'' sequel again in late March 2007. In an interview with IESB.net about another of the actor's films, Duchovny said that negotations for the sequel were in their final stages, and filming would probably start in 2008. He described the film as a "supernatural thriller" and has said that "there is no script completed, they are still developing the entire story."<ref>
{{cite web| url = http://www.latinoreview.com/news.php?id=1713| title = LatinoReview| X-Files 2 A Go For 2008| accessdate = 2007-03-28}}</ref> In an interview with ComingSoon.net given around the same time, he said he "thought" Carter and Spotnitz were talking to 20th Century Fox about another ''X-Files'' movie that week, saying, "I guess there are things to figure out."<ref>[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=19588]</ref>

In an interview published online by [[Empire magazine|Empire Magazine]] on April 2nd 2007, Anderson confirmed that "it seems like it might be for real this time. Somehow it seems like somebody<U+2019>s really serious about it. I know that Chris<U+2019> lawsuit with Fox is over, so maybe now it can be done." Regarding the plot for the new sequel, "all Chris says is that he wants to make a really scary horror, like a stand-alone episode. I don<U+2019>t think they<U+2019>re interested in touching on any of the conspiracy stuff."<ref> [http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=20576 Exclusive: Scully Talks X-Files Sequel] </ref>

The next day, in an [[IMDB|IMDb]] News Brief, Duchovny again confirmed that he and Anderson would like to reprise their roles in a sequel to the 1998 movie. He stated that Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz were working on the story and that "they're starting some kind of road towards doing it (the film). Gillian and I both want to be in it now. We're happy to do it. At this point all of the kind of fatigue and anxiety that we had towards the end of a nine-year run is gone."<ref> [http://www.us.imdb.com/news/wenn/2007-04-03/ All Go on 'X-Files' Sequel?] </ref>

On April 12th 2007, in a guest appearance on the 'Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson', Duchovny again stated that a second X-Files movie is in the works.<ref>[http://duchovny.net/multimedia/index67.htm Duchovny.Net Video Clips]</ref>

Frank Spotnitz, in a 4/17/07 update to his blog, briefly stated that a script was 'in development', and that he could say nothing further at present.  His comments seemed to indicate that no film had been 'in the works' before this time, and left some doubt as to whether the studio had agreed to anything beyond looking at the script after it was completed. [http://www.biglight.com/blog/2007/04/its-true.html]

[[Wired News]] tried to get more details from Spotnitz, and was told by an associate "Frank is very sorry but he cannot make any comments about XF2 right now but would be thrilled to talk when the time comes."  A FOX spokesperson was also contacted, but would only say that "A sequel to 'X Files' has been in development for quite a while."   Pressed to comment on whether Duchovny or Anderson had been signed to appear in the movie, she said "It's not anywhere near that level yet."

==Legacy==
''The X-Files'' directly inspired numerous other TV series, including ''[[Strange World (TV series)|Strange World]]'',<ref>{{citeweb|url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE2DD133FF93BA35750C0A96F958260|title = Television Review: Caught in the Trap Of Science Run Amok|author = Ron Wertheimer|accessdate = 2006-11-15}}</ref><ref name = "Xerox Files">{{citeweb|url = http://www.salon.com/ent/tv/mill/1999/03/08mill.html|title = The Xerox Files|author = Joyce Millman|accessdate = 2006-11-15}}</ref> ''Burning Zone'',<ref>{{citeweb|url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E1DE1338F930A3575AC0A960958260|title = A Virus That Speaks Of a Deadly World Plot|author = Caryn James|accessdate = 2006-11-15}}</ref> ''[[Special Unit 2]]'', ''[[Mysterious Ways]]'',<ref>{{citeweb|url = http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,85446_3%7C12855%7C%7C0_0_,00.html|title = Heaven Sent|author = Liane Bonin|accessdate = 2006-11-15}}</ref> ''[[Carniv<U+00E0>le]]'', ''[[Dark Skies]]'',<ref name = "Xerox Files" /> ''[[The Visitor (TV series)|The Visitor]]'',<ref name = "Xerox Files" /> ''[[Freaky Links]]'', ''[[The 4400]]'',<ref>{{citeweb|url = http://www.hollywoodnorthreport.com/article.php?Article=1664|title = Scott Peters Interview: HNR Chats with The 4400 Creator/Executive Producer|author = Robert Falconer HNR Senior Editor|accessdate = 2006-11-15}}</ref> ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'',
''[[Psi Factor: Chronicles of the Paranormal]]'', and ''[[Supernatural (TV Series)|Supernatural]]''. A few of these shows actually involved former staff of ''The X-Files'' behind the scenes<U+2014>such as ''Lost'', whose current cinematographer is John Bartley; the [[story arc|mytharc]]-dominated ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', executive produced by ''X-Files'' writer Howard Gordon; ''[[Six Feet Under]]'', coproduced by ''X-Files'' alum Lori Jo Nemhauser; and ''Supernatural'', involving directors David Nutter and Kim Manners, and writer/producer John Shiban.

The influence can be seen on other levels: television series such as ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'' have developed a complex mythology that may bring to mind the "mytharc" of ''The X-Files''. In terms of characterization, the role of Dana Scully was seen as somewhat original, causing a change in "how women [on television] were not just perceived but behaved", and perhaps influencing the portrayal of "strong women" investigators<ref name="twentyohsix"/> in shows such as ''[[CSI (TV series)|CSI]]''. Many [[police procedural|procedural dramas]] also feature a Mulder-esque lead with a supervisor similar to [[Walter Skinner|Skinner]] or Kersh. Some of these procedurals, such as ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'', feature a quirky technogeek similar to the Lone Gunmen characters.

[[Russell T. Davies]] said ''The X-Files'' had been an inspiration on his current British series ''[[Torchwood]]'',<ref>Chris Howell. Sci-Fi Wire. "Russell T. Davies on Torchwood." [ http://www.greatlink.org/shownewsitem.asp?item=5444]</ref> describing it as "dark, wild and sexy...

[[Joss Whedon]] described his show as a cross between ''The X-Files'' and ''[[My So-Called Life]]''.<ref>{{citeweb|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy//reallife/jwhedon.shtml|title = Joss Whedon|accessdate = 2007-01-13}}</ref>

===Pop culture===
{{Unreferenced|date=April 2007}}

*In 1995, a Norwegian techno-project named Bit To Beat released a single called "X-Files" which was a remix of the series' main theme. The single peaked at #4 at the Norwegian Top 20 VG Charts.

*In 1998, [[Wales|Welsh]] pop band [[Catatonia (band)|Catatonia]] reached #3 in [[UK Singles Chart|the UK singles chart]] with their song "[[Mulder and Scully]]."

*The bands [[Eve 6]] and [[Killswitch Engage]] derive their names, respectively, from ''The X-Files'' episodes "[[Eve (The X-Files episode)|Eve]]"<ref>[http://www.orlandofloridaguide.com/entertainment/music/bands/eve6/interview.htm]</ref> and "[[William Gibson's "The X-Files" episodes|Kill Switch]]."<ref>[http://www.disturb.org/Killswitch_eng.html]</ref>

*The songs "[[One Week]]" by [[Barenaked Ladies]] and "[[The Bad Touch]]" by [[Bloodhound Gang]] contain direct references to "The X-Files." (David Duchovny performed as a backup vocalist/maracca player on a late night talk show with the Barenaked Ladies, on the song "It's All Been Done.") The [[Busta Rhymes]]/[[Mariah Carey]] duet "[[I Know What You Want]]" contains the line, ''"We like Scull' and Mulder, walkin' shoulder to shoulder"'' in [[Rah Digga]]'s rap. American progressive rock band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] references ''The X-Files'' in the 2006 song "Rosetta Stoned."  The song contains the lyrics, "Then the X-Files being, looking like some kind of blue-green [[Jackie Chan]] with [[Isabella Rossellini]] lips, and breath that reeked of vanilla Chig Champa."

*Hip-hop artist [[Del tha Funkee Homosapien]] has a song eponymously named "X-Files" off his 1998 album, ''[[Future Development]]''.

*American [[singer-songwriter]] [[Bree Sharp]]'s 1999 debut album included the popular novelty tune, "David Duchovny." The song is a tribute to Duchovny and ''The X-Files'' in general with many references to the show throughout the song.

*A 1994 episode of ''Picket Fences'', "Away in a Manger", concerned cattle giving birth to human babies and alluded to events that had taken place in ''The X-Files'' episode "Red Museum". The two episodes were written by the shows' executive producers<U+2014>[[David E. Kelley]] and Chris Carter, respectively<U+2014>and had been planned as crossovers, with ''Picket Fences'' following ''The X-Files'' timeslot on a different network, CBS, and concluding the story. However, CBS refused to allow Duchovny to guest star in ''Picket Fences'', so Kelley and Carter both rewrote their scripts to be self-contained.

*In perhaps one of the earliest references, a [[1995]] episode of ''[[Eek! The Cat]]'' called "Eek Space 9", features a group of aliens about to invade the Earth. Before they get the chance a satellite hits their ship and it crashes into the FBI Building. Scully races out of her office and runs into Mulder promptly shouting her belief in aliens as the aliens on the crashed ship walk out of her office and promptly notice ''The X-Files'' music in the background. Both Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny voiced their respective characters in the brief scene.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

*Fox Mulder was referenced in the final episode of the FOX TV show ''[[Strange Luck]]'' in 1995, leading some to conclude the short-lived series had taken place in the same fictional universe as ''The X-Files''.

* The [[1996]] ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode "[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]" had two Federation agents called Dulmer and Lucsly visit [[Deep Space 9]] to ask Captain [[Benjamin Sisko]] about his meeting with [[James T. Kirk]]. "Dulmer" is an anagram of Mulder and Lucsly is an anagram of Scully.

*In 1997, ''The X-Files'' was lampooned on an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' entitled "[[The Springfield Files]]". The episode revolved around a strange occurrence in Springfield, with Mulder and Scully coming to investigate and working closely with [[Homer Simpson]]. Duchovny and Anderson voiced their respective characters in the episode.

*Mulder and Scully were parodied in an episode of [[ReBoot]] by Mainframe studios of Canada. They appeared as sprites named 'Fax Modem' and 'Data Nully'. 

*In February 2001, the [[sketch comedy]] radio program ''[[Pirate Radio (Nashville)|Pirate Radio]]'' lampooned "The X-Files" with a sketch entitled [[Pirate Radio (Nashville)#Infamous Sketches|"The X-Files Valentine Special"]]. Bizarrely created with a western motif, the sketch contained many tongue-in-cheek jokes about the nature of the characters, story arcs, and merchandise, then culminated with an argument between Mulder and Scully in which they exchange gunfire and Scully is shot and killed.

==Influences on the show==
===Television===
Chris Carter listed television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[Tales from the Darkside]]'' and especially ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]'' as his major influences for the show. Carter said, "Remembering that show, which I loved, I said to the Fox executives, 'There's nothing scary on [[Television network|network television]] anymore. Let's do a scary show.'"<ref name="cult"/> Actor [[Darren McGavin]] who played Carl Kolchak in ''Kolchak: The Night Stalker'' appeared in two episodes of ''The X-Files'' as Agent Arthur Dales, a character described as the "father of the X-Files."

Carter has mentioned that the relationship between Mulder and Scully (platonic but with sexual tension) was influenced by the chemistry between [[John Steed]] ([[Patrick Macnee]]) and Mrs. [[Emma Peel]] ([[Diana Rigg]]) in the 1960s British spy TV program ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name="cyber"/> One journalist documented possible influence from [[Nigel Kneale]]'s ''[[Quatermass]]'' series and its various television and film iterations.<ref>"Muldermass and the Pit", The 11th Hour Web Magazine, September 1999. [http://www.the11thhour.com/archives/091999/features/muldermass1.html]</ref> Kneale was invited to write for ''The X-Files'', but declined the offer.<ref name="kneale">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,60-2432768.html|title=Nigel Kneale|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=[[2006-11-02]]|accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref>

The early '90s cult hit ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' is seen as a major influence on the show's dark atmosphere and its often surreal blend of drama and irony. David Duchovny had appeared as a [[cross-dressing]] DEA agent in ''Twin Peaks'', and the character of Mulder was seen as a parallel to the show's FBI Agent [[Dale Cooper]].<ref name="NYT"/> Both shows were filmed in the [[Pacific Northwest]].

The producers and writers have cited ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]],'' ''[[Three Days of the Condor]]'', ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', ''[[Rashomon]]'', ''[[The Thing]]'', ''[[The Boys from Brazil (film)|The Boys from Brazil]]'', ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'',<ref name="FAQ2"/> and ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' as influences on the series. Gangster movies such as the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' trilogy are also frequently referenced in the show's conspiracy plotlines, particularly concerning the Syndicate. A scene at the end of the episode "Redux II" (5.02), for instance, directly mirrors the famous baptism [[Montage sequence|montage]] at the end of ''The Godfather''. Chris Carter's use of continuous takes in "Triangle" (6.03) was modeled on Hitchcock's ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]''. Other episodes written by Carter made numerous references to other films, as did those by Darin Morgan (see [[#Trivia|below]]).

==Awards==
Over the course of its nine seasons, the show was nominated for 141 awards, winning a total of 61 individual awards from 24 different agencies, including the [[Emmys]], the [[Golden Globes]], the [[Environmental Media Awards]], and the [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]].<ref name="awards">

The show earned a total of 16 Emmys; two for acting, one for writing, and 13 for various technical categories. In September 1994, ''The X-Files'' won its first award, the Emmy for ''Outstanding Individual Achievement in Graphic Design and Title Sequences''.

[[Peter Boyle]] later won the Emmy for ''Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series'' for his portrayal of the title character in the third-season episode "[[Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose]]". In the same year, [[Darin Morgan]] won the Emmy for ''Outstanding Individual Achievement in Writing for a Drama Series'' for the same episode. "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" was one of four highly-acclaimed episodes Morgan wrote during his short time on the show's writing staff. In [[1997]], both Duchovny and Anderson won Golden Globe awards for the best male and female actors in a drama series.

Throughout its run, ''The X-Files'' also won Emmy awards in seven technical categories: ''Graphic Design and Title Sequences'', ''Cinematography'', ''Sound Editing and Mixing'', ''Art Direction'', ''Single Camera Picture Editing'', ''Makeup'', and ''[[Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects|Special Visual Effects]]''.

==Broadcast history==
The first season of ''The X-Files'' premiered on [[September 10]], [[1993]] on FOX. Approximately a year later, it started showing in the [[United Kingdom]] upon the [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial channel]] [[BBC2]], airing at 21:00. Since then, it has expanded into other countries across the world, either being dubbed or subtitled to accommodate for foreign language viewers.

For the first few years of its run, its ratings steadily increased, reaching its zenith in terms of ratings by its fifth season.<ref name="RATINGS"/> Season 4's "Leonard Betts" which aired on FOX after [[Super Bowl|the Super Bowl]] in 1997, holds the record for the highest rated episode. The next 15 highest [[Nielsen ratings]] were for "Redux" (5x02), "Redux II" (5x03), "[[El Mundo Gira]]" (4x11), "Herrenvolk" (4x01), "[[Detour (The X-Files)|Detour]]" (5x04), "Small Potatoes" (4x20), "Never Again" (4x13), "Unusual Suspects" (5x01), "Schizogeny" (5x09), "Christmas Carol" (5x05), "Gethsemane" (4x24), "Chinga" (5x10), "Patient X" (5x13), "The Rain King" (6ABX07) and "Emily" (5x07).<ref name="RATINGS"/>

The show was first [[TV syndication|syndicated]] in the U.S. on a [[News Corporation|Fox]]-owned [[Cable television|cable channel]], [[FX (TV network)|FX]]. This arrangement resulted in a 1999 lawsuit from David Duchovny, claiming the contract had not been open to fair bidding. The suit was settled out of court.<ref name="LAWSUIT">Aspan, Maria. "'X-Files' Are Closed; a Lawsuit Opens." ''The New York Times'', January 30, 2006. [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/23/business/23carter.html?ex=1295672400&en=7731d5c054e8894d&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss]</ref> ''X-Files'' reruns are currently being shown on [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] and the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci-Fi Channel]], among others. Chris Carter filed his own lawsuit over syndication issues against [[20th Century Fox Television]] on [[December 30, 2005]]; this is seen as a main impediment to plans for a second ''X-Files'' movie.

==Merchandise==
{{main|The X-Files merchandise}}

''X-Files'' related merchandise includes VHS and DVD sets, music [[Compact Disc|compact discs]], [[video game]]s, [[t-shirt]]s, a collector's edition of [[Barbie]] and Ken as Scully and Mulder, [[action figure]]s based on ''Fight the Future'', and a [[The X-Files merchandise#Magazine|magazine]] devoted specifically to the show. The entire series is currently available on DVD by season, one of the first shows to be released in such a format. Also available are "mythology" sets which collect episodes related to a particular storyline, such as ''Colonization'' or ''Black Oil''. Forty-eight episodes, selected to represent the best of the show's first four seasons, were also available on VHS in "wave" sets; the interviews with Carter preceding these were later included on the DVDs.

Video games included ''[[The X-Files: The Game]]'', ''[[The X-Files: Unrestricted Access]]'' and ''[[The X-Files: Resist or Serve]]'' which expanded on the storyline of the show. ''The X-Files: The Game'' fits into the mythology, taking place near the end of the third season. The episodes Renascence, Resonance, and Reckoning from ''The X-Files: Resist or Serve'' fit into the mythology, having an unknown placement in the seventh season.

==Relationship to other Ten Thirteen Productions shows==
[[Chris Carter]], creator of ''The X-Files'', founded [[Ten Thirteen Productions]], which also produced his other science fiction and horror shows.

===''Millennium''===
{{main|Millennium (TV series)}}
''Millennium'' is generally not considered to be set in the same "universe" as ''The X-Files'', with many episodes dwelling on brutal crime stories without paranormal elements, and others featuring their own more spiritual "mythology". However, several connections exist between the series:
* In the season 1 ''Millennium'' episode "Lamentation", written by Chris Carter, the main character Frank Black visits the FBI building and Mulder and Scully are briefly seen descending a stairway. In fact, it is Duchovny and Anderson's [[stand-in]]s who are seen.<ref>http://www.fourthhorseman.com/Abyss/Episodes/epi117.htm</ref>
* In the season 2 ''Millennium'' episode "Jose Chung's ''Doomsday Defense''" the "[[nonfiction]] science fiction" writer [[Jose Chung]] appears, who was first seen in the season 3 ''X-Files'' episode called "Jose Chung's ''From Outer Space''". Both episodes were written by Darin Morgan.
* [[Lance Henriksen]] and [[Brittany Tiplady]] make their final appearances as ''Millennium'' characters Frank and Jordan Black in the season 7 ''X-Files'' episode "Millennium", which aired in November 1999. ''Millennium'' had been canceled earlier that year after its third season.

===''Harsh Realm''===
{{main|Harsh Realm}}
This brief 1999 series was based on a [[graphic novel]] and is not considered to have many ties with ''The X-Files'' or other Ten Thirteen shows. However, [[Gillian Anderson]] provided voiceovers in the pilot episode, and [[Terry O'Quinn]], who costarred as Peter Watts in ''Millennium'' and guest starred as different characters in several ''X-Files'' episodes and the feature film, had a large role. [[Scott Bairstow]], who starred in the season one ''X-Files'' episode "Miracle Man", was another lead actor before the show's quick cancellation.

===''The Lone Gunmen''===
{{main|The Lone Gunmen (TV Series)}}
The key relationship of this 2001 show to ''The X-Files'' is its starring role of John Fitzgerald Byers, Richard "Ringo" Langley and Melvin Frohike<U+2014>the "[[Lone Gunmen]]" of the eponymous show. Due to it being set within the same "universe" as ''The X-Files'', the show occasionally featured characters from ''The X-Files'', such as Walter Skinner in TLG's "The Lying Game" episode; Fox Mulder and Morris Fletcher in ''The Lone Gunmen'' episode "All About Yves," the show's finale.

{{spoiler}}

With the cancellation of ''The Lone Gunmen'' series before a resolution to this cliffhanger could be produced, ''The X-Files'' episode "Jump the Shark"<U+2014>a reference to the [[jumping the shark|television term]]<U+2014>served as an epitaph to the show. It featured the Lone Gunmen, Jimmy Bond, [[Yves Adele Harlow]], Kimmy the Geek, plus Walter Skinner and Morris Fletcher, two ''X-Files'' characters also featured on ''The Lone Gunmen''. In this episode, the trio is supposedly killed while attempting to stop the release of a plague contagion.

==Trivia==
{{toomuchtrivia}}
*While Mulder believes in extraterrestrial life, and Scully does not (until season 6), the opposite is true of [[David Duchovny]] and [[Gillian Anderson]] (i.e. Duchovny does not believe EBEs exist,<ref name="xffaq">[http://paul.rutgers.edu/~cwm/bedlam/x-files/xfilesFAQ.html#real The X-Files FAQ.]</ref> while Anderson does).<ref>Nadine Crenshaw, ''Scully X-Posed: The Unauthorized Biography of Gillian Anderson'' (1997, ISBN 0761511113)</ref><ref name="Anderson"/> She says, "It's more likely than not that there are life forms<U+2014>probably more intelligent than we are<U+2014>out there."<ref name="june">Chanko, Kenneth. "Gillian Is Out There." ''eDrive'', June 1998. [http://www.gilliananderson.ws/transcripts/98/98edrive.shtml]</ref>

*[[William B. Davis]], who plays the [[Cigarette Smoking Man]], quit [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] in the late 1970s and smoked [[herbal cigarette]]s on the set, fearing that he would become re-[[nicotine|addicted]].<ref>Interview with William B. Davis, 11th October 2005. [http://www.thescifiworld.net/interviews/william_b_davis_01.htm]</ref> He is a spokesperson for the [[Canadian Cancer Society]].

*Creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]]'s birthday is October 13, thus the frequent references to the number 1013 on the show and the reason Fox Mulder's birthday is also [[October 13]]. It is also the name of Carter's production company, [[Ten Thirteen Productions]]. In the episode "Triangle," written and directed by Carter, the uninterrupted take during the second act (Scully in the halls of the FBI building) runs exactly 10 minutes and 13 seconds.<ref name="TRI">Review of Triangle (6.03) [http://www.angelfire.com/ga/wkb/xftriangle.html]</ref> The number 1121, and especially the time 11:21 PM, also appears regularly on ''The X-Files'', particularly in the early seasons. This is a reference by Chris Carter to his wife Dori's birthday, [[November 21]].

*Mulder's apartment number is 42, in reference to [[Douglas Adams]]' ''[[Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', where the number is the answer to life, the universe, and everything.

*Several characters and places in ''The X-Files'' have been named after cast and crew members and relatives. Gillian Anderson's daughter Piper, whose birth necessitated Scully's [[abduction]] in the second season, was the namesake for the third season episode "Piper Maru". The foul-mouthed Detective Manners in "Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'" was named for director Kim Manners,<ref name="in">X-Files in-jokes list, season 3. [http://mywebpages.comcast.net/injoke/xfjokes3.html]</ref> who directed the most episodes of any ''X-Files'' director, 52 (but not including that one). Rob Bowman, the second most prolific director, inspired the name of a character in "Kitsunegari", a sequel to the third season episode "Pusher" which he directed.

*The role of [[John Doggett]] almost went to cult star [[Bruce Campbell]],<ref>http://www.flickfilosopher.com/blog/2006/07/bruce_campbell_week_the_bruces.html</ref> but he was ruled out for having already appeared on an ''X-Files'' episode<U+2014>season 6's "Terms of Endearment"<U+2014>as another character. [[Robert Patrick]] was ultimately cast in the role. However, several actors have played multiple minor roles in the show throughout different periods, such as [[Chris Owens]] and [[Terry O'Quinn]]. Local Vancouver actors were frequently seen reappearing in early seasons.<ref name="deep"/>

*Several fictional [[brand names]] were used throughout the show's run. Mulder and Scully rent a [[Ford Taurus]] on many of their trips, usually from "Lariat [[car rental|Rent-a-Car]]" (especially in early seasons). Notably, packs of "Morley" cigarettes were often used as shorthand to signify the presence of the Cigarette Smoking Man. This was later picked up in homage by ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', whose character [[Spike (Buffyverse)|Spike]] also smokes Morleys. In addition, an episode of ''[[Veronica Mars]]'' also featured the Lariat car company, and an episode of ''[[CSI (TV series)|CSI]]'' featured Morleys.<ref>List of TV crossovers. [http://home.vicnet.net.au/~kwgow/cross_key.txt]</ref>

*[[Tom Braidwood]], who plays [[Melvin Frohike|Frohike]] of [[The Lone Gunmen]], was [[First Assistant Director]] ([[Second Unit]]) on ''The X-Files'' from 1993 to 1999. During shooting for the first season episode "E.B.E.", producers and writers were struggling to cast the part (then considered a one-off) when Braidwood emerged from a bathroom and they realized he fit the role.<ref>IMDB info on Tom Braidwood. [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0104006/bio]</ref> Frohike was originally going to be killed in the 1996 episode "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man" before Carter nixed the idea, but the scene was actually shot by director James Wong.<ref name="musings">''Cinefantastique'' Interview with James Wong and Glen Morgan, 1997. (part two) [http://www.morganandwongonline.com/paula11.htm]</ref> The character lasted until 2002, after Braidwood's retirement from directing.

*The show was not endorsed by the FBI and was not allowed to use an official FBI shield. However, ''The X-Files'' was acknowledged by the bureau early in its run when Duchovny and Anderson were invited to the Washington, D.C. headquarters and the training facility in Quantico for advice on proper firearm use (although the on-screen agents rarely fired their weapons). Carter said, "The FBI has given us information about protocol and procedure. That's been the extent of the bureau's cooperation. We've gone to great lengths not to paint the FBI as bad guys, but as tools of some higher level of government that orders Scully and Mulder off sensitive cases for whatever reasons."<ref name="cult"/> According to some reports, job applications to the FBI surged during the '90s as a result of ''The X-Files'' and other films and TV shows, despite the fact that the depiction of [[Paranormal Investigation|paranormal investigators]] was fictional.

*Episodes written by [[Darin Morgan]] contained numerous [[in-jokes]] and references to previous episodes of ''The X-Files'', to cast and crew members, and to other works and artists ranging from [[Roky Erickson]] to [[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]]'s ''[[Pale Fire]]'' (see [[Darin Morgan#In-jokes and references|article]]). The name of the title character in "Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'" originated in a practical joke by the ''X-Files'' writing staff, where writers would impersonate a nonexistent man called [[Jose Chung]] who called the production offices to inquire about an unsolicited script he had submitted, always being turned away,<ref name="in"/> as it was a policy of ''The X-Files'' not to accept story submissions from outside.<ref name="transcr"/> The name of [[Peter Boyle]]'s title character in "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" is an homage to a [[silent movie]] [[screenwriter]] and [[film director|director]] [[Clyde Bruckman]], who worked on famous films of [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Harold Lloyd]]. The latter was Morgan's main influence.<ref name="darin"/> However, the town of [[sideshow]] "freaks" where Morgan set his episode "Humbug", actually exists ([[Gibsonton, Florida]]).

*This was the first show to reach the top 20 in the FOX network's history.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}<!--And if anyone finds a source for this, please add it as a citation for the intro claim that it was "one of the FOX network's first major hits"-->
