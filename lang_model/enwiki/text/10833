The paper comprehensively outlined and analyzed several key processes that might be responsible for the [[nucleosynthesis|synthesis of elements in nature]] and [[Abundance of the chemical elements|their relative abundance]], and is credited with originating what is now the theory of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]].

==Physics in 1957==
At the time of the publication of '''B<sup>2</sup>FH''', [[George Gamow]] advocated a theory of the universe according to which virtually all [[Chemical element|elements]], or [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]], were synthesized during the [[big bang]]. The implications of Gamow's nucleosynthesis theory (not to be confused with present-day [[nucleosynthesis]] theory) is that [[Abundance of the chemical elements|nuclear abundances]] in the universe are largely static. [[Hans Bethe]] and [[Charles L. Critchfield]] had together derived the [[Proton proton chain|pp-chain]] in 1938,<ref>

}}</ref> had independently derived the [[CNO cycle]] in 1938 and 1939, respectively, to show that the conversion of [[hydrogen]] to [[helium]] by [[nuclear fusion]] could account for stellar energy production. Thus, it was known by Gamow and others in 1957 that the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundances]] of hydrogen and helium were not perfectly static. However, at the time, stellar fusion theories did not show how to create any elements heavier than helium, and so Gamow advocated the theory that all elements were residual from the big bang, allowing for slight changes in the ratios of hydrogen and helium. B<sup>2</sup>FH gave a different account for the origin of heavy elements, suggesting that all atomic nuclei heavier than [[lithium]] (up through [[uranium]]) must have been synthesized in [[star]]s and not during the big bang. Both theories agree that the some light nuclei, between hydrogen and lithium, were not created in stars, and this led to the now-accepted theory of [[big bang nucleosynthesis]].

==Physics in the paper==
Because '''B<sup>2</sup>FH''' argued that a majority of all elements except for hydrogen{{check|date=April 2011}} must come from stars, their ideas are called the theory of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. An often quoted statement of [[Carl Sagan]], "We are all star stuff," is simply his paraphrase of this review paper's thesis. The key difference between this theory of stellar nucleosynthesis and all previous accounts for the origin of the elements is that B<sup>2</sup>FH predicts [[chemical evolution]] of the universe, which is testable by looking at stellar [[spectral lines]]. [[Quantum mechanics]] explains why different atoms emit light at [[Electromagnetic spectroscopy|characteristic wavelengths]], and so by studying the light emitted from different stars, one may infer the atmospheric composition of individual stars. However, upon undertaking such a task, observations indicate a strong [[Negative relationship|negative correlation]] between a star's heavy element content ([[metallicity]]) and its age ([[red shift]]): younger stars tend to have higher metallicity.

[[Big bang nucleosynthesis]] tells us that the early universe consisted of only the light elements, and so one expects the first stars to be composed of [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], and [[lithium]], the three lightest elements. [[Stellar structure]] and the [[Hertzsprung<U+2013>Russell diagram]] indicate that the lifetime of a star depends greatly on its initial mass, so that massive stars are very short-lived, and less massive stars are longer-lived. As a star dies, B<sup>2</sup>FH argues that it will enrich the [[interstellar medium]] with 'heavy elements' (in this case all elements heavier than lithium, the third element), from which new stars are formed. This account is consistent with the observed negative correlation between stellar metallicity and red shift.

However, the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis advocated by B<sup>2</sup>FH would not be very convincing if it could not also detail the [[nuclear physics]] and [[astrophysics]] involved. By carefully scrutinizing the [[table of nuclides]], the authors were able to predict the existence of different stellar environments which could produce the observed [[Abundance of the chemical elements|isotopic abundances]], and the nuclear processes which must occur in these stars. In this paper, among other things, the authors predicted the existence of the [[p-process]], [[r-process]], and [[s-process]] to account for many of the elements heavier than [[iron]], and these idea have since come to bear much fruit.

==Writing of the paper==
[[Margaret Burbidge|Margaret]] and [[Geoffrey Burbidge]] wrote the first draft of the paper, deliberately incorporating extensive observations and experimental data to support the theory. Both Hoyle and [[William Alfred Fowler|Fowler]] worked extensively on the early draft. Geoffrey Burbidge says that it is a misconception some have had that Fowler was the leader of the group. "There was no leader in the group," he wrote in 2008, "We all made substantial contributions."<ref name=hoylesrole>

==Recognition==
Because this work firmly established the field of [[nuclear astrophysics]], [[William Alfred Fowler|William Fowler]] was awarded half of the 1983 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his contributions; some believe that [[Fred Hoyle]] also deserved similar recognition for his scholarship on this topic, and contend that his unorthodox views concerning the [[big bang]] played a role in his lack of a [[Nobel Prize]].

[[Geoffrey Burbidge]] wrote in 2008, "Hoyle should have been awarded a Nobel Prize for this and other work. On the basis of my private correspondence, I believe that a major reason for his exclusion was that W.A. Fowler was believed to be the leader of the group."<ref name=hoylesrole/> Burbidge states that this perception is not true and also points to Hoyle's earlier papers from 1946<ref>

}}</ref> as indicators of Hoyle's authorship of the theory of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. Burbidge explains, "Hoyle's work has been undercited in part because it was published in an astrophysical journal,<ref name=hoyle54/> and a new one at that (the very first volume, in fact), whereas ''B<sup>2</sup>FH'' was published in a well-established physics journal, ''[[Reviews of Modern Physics]]''. When ''B<sup>2</sup>FH'' was first written, preprints were widely distributed to the [[nuclear physics]] community. Willy Fowler was very well known as a leader in that community, and the [[California Institute of Technology]] already had a news bureau that knew how to spread the word.

In [[2007]] a conference was held in [[Pasadena, California]] to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the publication of this influential paper.<ref>
