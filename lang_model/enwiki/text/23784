'''Disco Kid''' is an [[African American]] boxer in the [[Nintendo]]-produced video game ''[[Punch-Out!! (Wii)|Punch-Out!!]]'' for [[Wii]]. He has an affinity for [[disco dancing]] and a variety of [[exercise]] called "boxercising". He was designed by Eddie Viser and voiced by Donny Lucas. He is described as flamboyant, with a penchant for clubbing. He is the only new character introduced into the Wii ''Punch-Out!!'', which otherwise had only characters from ''[[Punch-Out!! (NES)|Punch-Out!!]]'' and ''[[Super Punch-Out!!]]'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Super NES]] respectively.

Since appearing in ''Punch-Out!!'', Disco Kid has been met with positive reception. He has been referenced as fitting in very well with the other ''Punch-Out!!'' boxers, with editors from both [[Kotaku]] and ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' commenting as such, though the latter editor commented that he did not seem to have much disco to him. He has been compared to [[Carlton Banks]] of ''[[Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' by both [[1UP.com]] and [[ESPN]].com, the latter having made the comparison twice. [[GamesRadar]] noted Disco Kid's affinity for tricked-out cars with loud bass as a black stereotype, though commenting that his stereotypes were mild compared to others in the series, citing Glass Joe's as an example. They added that [[Mr. Sandman (Punch-Out!!)|Mr. Sandman]] was a counterbalance to him, featuring no eccentric qualities.

==Concept and appearances==
Disco Kid is the only new character to appear in the [[Wii]] video game ''[[Punch-Out!! (Wii)|Punch-Out!!]]'', appearing as the third boxer after [[Von Kaiser]]. He was designed by Eddie Viser and voiced by Donny Lucas. He was one of the first characters revealed in the Wii ''Punch-Out!!'', alongside [[Glass Joe]], Von Kaiser, and [[King Hippo]], though he was revealed on the box art separately from the ''Punch-Out!!'' trailer reveal for the above mentioned three. He is characterized as being flamboyant, featuring a high-pitched voice and an affinity for dance. In the cutscenes from ''Punch-Out!!'', he is depicted as having a tricked-out car with a loud bass and going clubbing. In another cutscene, he is seen feeling down until he discovers a "boxercising" program, causing him to utilize the exercise in his fighting style. Whereas he is typically seen in standard boxing attire, his Title Defense incarnation features him in purple [[spandex]]. Senior Product Specialist Nate Williams states that Disco Kid has his own attacks, and is unique in his own way to other boxers in the game.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=4160691 |title=Punch Out!! is Wii's latest champ - The Gamer - ESPN The Magazine |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref>

==Reception==
Since appearing in ''[[Punch-Out!! (Wii)|Punch-Out!!]]'' for the [[Wii]], Disco Kid has received positive reception, one of the specific reasons being that he fit well with the characters who returned from earlier games in the series. [[IGN]] editor Craig Harris stated that Disco Kid fit in the ''Punch-Out!!'' series "like a glove", citing the developer's attention to detail for this.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harris |first=Craig |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/983/983268p1.html |title=Punch-out!!

===Flamboyance and stereotyping===
[[File:Disco Kid 2.png|right|thumb|200px|Disco Kid has an affinity for clubbing and dancing, particularly [[disco]] style.]]
He has been described as both a stereotype of black people, as well as being flamboyant. [[Kotaku]] editor Michael McWhertor, while commenting on the stereotypes of ''Punch-Out!!'', begins to speak about Disco Kid, but stops and states "let's just call him flamboyant".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5261201/punch+out-review-call-it-a-comeback |title=Punch-Out!!
