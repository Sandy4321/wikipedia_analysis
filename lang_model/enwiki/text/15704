== Chicago Outfit career ==
From 1978 until 1992, Calabrese helped his brother, noted [[Chicago Outfit]] boss [[Frank Calabrese, Sr.]], run a lucrative loan-sharking racket, serving as his brother's top assistant. Frank and Nick report to [[Angelo J. LaPietra|Angelo J. "The Hook" LaPietra]], who was the Boss of the 26th Street Crew and ran operations out of the [[Old Neighborhood Italian American Club]]. Calabrese also has admitted in court to taking part in 14 murders ordered by LaPietra, including the "hits" on Michael Albergo and John Fecarotta, from 1970 until 1986, as part of Calabrese's time in the mob.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jeff |last=Coen |coauthors= |title=Brother against brother - Mobster tells Family Secrets jury of 'hits'  |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=1 |date=July 17, 2007 |accessdate=20 March 2009|quote= |url= }}</ref>  The "juice loan" business charged interest rates on loans of as much as 10 percent per week.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Top loan shark's brother sentenced for role in racket  |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=3 |date=August 28, 1997 |accessdate=20 March 2009|quote= |url= }}</ref>

On July 28, 1995, the federal government indicted Nicholas Calabrese and nine other organized crime figures with using threats, violence and intimidation to enforce the loan sharking racket from 1978 until 1992.  The other defendants were [[Frank Calabrese, Sr.]], Frank Calabrese, Jr., Kurt Calabrese, Robert Dinella, Philip J. Fiore, Terry Scalise, Kevin Kudulis, Louis Bombacino and Philip Tolomeo.<ref>{{cite news |first=Matt |last=O'Connor |coauthors= |title=U.S. indicts 9 in push to 'dent' mob  |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=1 |date=July 29, 1995 |accessdate=20 March 2009|quote= |url= }}</ref>

Calabrese eventually was found guilty of racketeering.  On August 27, 1997, Calabrese, who at that time was residing in [[Norridge, Illinois]], was sentenced by United States District Judge [[James F. Holderman]] to 70 months in federal prison. At his sentencing, Nicholas Calabrese apologized to Holderman, saying, "I caused a lot of problems for a lot of people."<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Top loan shark's brother sentenced for role in racket  |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=3 |date=August 28, 1997 |accessdate=20 March 2009|quote= |url= }}</ref>

== Family Secrets investigation and conviction ==
On February 21, 2003, [[Chicago Tribune]] columnist [[John Kass]] broke the story that Calabrese was talking to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], and noted that Calabrese had disappeared from the federal prison in [[Milan, Michigan]], and that Calabrese's federal prison records had disappeared altogether, leading Kass to believe that Calabrese had entered the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program]].  FBI agents also had spread out across the country with search warrants, collecting DNA evidence, hair cuttings and oral swabs from many reputed [[Chicago Outfit]] members.<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Kass |coauthors= |title=Outfit bosses dive for cover as enforcer talks  |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=2 |date=February 21, 2003 |accessdate=20 March 2009|quote= |url= }}</ref>

On April 25, 2005, federal prosecutors indicted 12 [[Chicago Outfit]] figures<U+2014>including Calabrese<U+2014>and two former police officers on charges of murder, illegal gambling and loan sharking. Dubbed, "Operation Family Secrets," the probe that led up to the indictments had relied heavily on Calabrese's cooperation. Newspapers reported that Calabrese had been confronted with DNA evidence implicating him in the 1986 mob hit of [[mob enforcer]] John Fecarotta, prompting Calabrese to cooperate with law enforcement in the probe.<ref>{{cite news |first=Matt |last=O'Connor |coauthors=Todd Lighty |title=U.S. drops hammer on who's who of mob - Charges range from murder to racketeering  |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=1 |date=April 26, 2005 |accessdate=20 March 2009|quote= |url= }}</ref>

After various plea agreements and the deaths of two defendants, ultimately five other defendants -- [[Joseph Lombardo]], [[James Marcello]], [[Frank Calabrese, Sr.]], Paul Schiro and Anthony Doyle<U+2014>went to trial.  Calabrese formally entered a plea of guilty to murder and racketeering on May 18, 2007.<ref>{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Warmbir |coauthors= |title=Star witness Calabrese admits  |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |page=2 |date=May 19, 2007 |accessdate=20 March 2009|quote= |url= }}</ref>  On July 16, 2007, Nicholas Calabrese took the witness stand and admitted to committing murders with Marcello, Schiro and his brother Frank Calabrese, Sr. Nicholas Calabrese admitted to having committed a total of 14 murders, and as part of his deal for cooperating, federal prosecutors agreed not to prosecute him for any of the 14 murders, thus sparing him the sentence of life in prison that he could have received had he been convicted of even one murder. Prosecutors also agreed to recommend a sentence of less than life in prison.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jeff |last=Coen |coauthors= |title=Brother against brother - Mobster tells Family Secrets jury of 'hits'  |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=1 |date=July 17, 2007 |accessdate=20 March 2009|quote= |url= }}</ref>

While on the stand, Calabrese stated that his association with the [[Chicago Outfit]] dated to May 1970, and that he began cooperating with the government in January 2002, after federal investigators confronted him with a bloody glove containing his [[DNA]] that he had inadvertently dropped at the scene of the Fecarotta slaying. Calabrese also acknowledged that he had been joined in the Fecarotta murder by his brother Frank Calabrese, Sr., and now-deceased mobster John Monteleone.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jeff |last=Coen |coauthors= |title=Brother against brother - Mobster tells Family Secrets jury of 'hits'  |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page= |date=July 17, 2007 |accessdate=20 March 2009|quote= |url= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Warmbir |coauthors= |title=Calabrese : I killed with my brother - 'If you got an order, you'd have to do it' |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |page=5 |date=July 17, 2007 |accessdate=20 March 2009|quote= |url= }}</ref>

Calabrese also provided details on the infamous slayings of [[Chicago Outfit]] member [[Anthony Spilotro]] and Outfit associate [[Michael Spilotro]], in 1986, in which Calabrese said he was one of a large number of mobsters who participated.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jeff |last=Coen |coauthors= |title=A plea for a prayer before mob slayings - Insider details infamous hit on Spilotros  |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=1 |date=July 19, 2007 |accessdate=20 March 2009|quote= |url= }}</ref>  The murders were depicted<U+2014>with some details changed<U+2014>in the 1995 movie ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]''.

Calabrese admitted that he initially had lied to the [[FBI]] after he began cooperating, initially concealing Marcello's role in the Spilotros' killing because Marcello had been paying Calabrese's wife $4,000 a month while Calabrese was in prison.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Mobster: Fear led me to kill, then 'rat' - Outfit insider grilled by brother's lawyer  |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=1 |date=July 20, 2007 |accessdate=20 March 2009|quote= |url= }}</ref>

In 2007, Lombardo, Marcello, Schiro and Frank Calabrese, Sr., all were convicted on murder and racketeering charges, while Doyle was convicted on racketeering charges. In February 2009, Lombardo, Marcello and Frank Calabrese, Sr. all were sentenced to life in prison. During Marcello's sentencing hearing on February 5, 2009, Dr. Patrick Spilotro, an [[oral surgeon]] who is the brother of the murdered Spilotro brothers, told the courtroom during his victim impact statement that he had encouraged Nicholas Calabrese to begin cooperating with the government.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Reputed mob boss gets life sentence  |work=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]] |page=13 |date=February 6, 2009 |accessdate=20 March 2009|quote= |url= }}</ref>

== Sentencing ==
On March 26, 2009, Nick Calabrese was sentenced by United States District Judge [[James Zagel]] to 12 years and four months in prison.  Prior to sentencing Calabrese, Zagel told some of Calabrese's victims' family members who were in the courtroom, "the law provides for leniency, undeserved leniency, for those who can testify truthfully about what has happened to those missing loved ones...Few in prisons will ever come forward to confess if leniency is not possible."  Upon sentencing Calabrese, Zagel told him, "I think what you did does make amends by allowing penalties to be paid for the murders of others and for allowing families to know how and why their (loved ones) died."<ref>http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2009/03/mobster-turncoat-gets-12-years-4-months.html</ref>  Zagel also noted that Calabrese never will fully live as a free man.  "The organization whose existence you testified to will not forgive or relent in their pursuit of you," Zagel told Calabrese.<ref>http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2009/03/mobster-turncoat-gets-12-years-4-months.html</ref>

Calabrese likely will be released from federal prison in 2013, although he is expected to live the rest of his life in the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/mob/1497774,mob-killer-nick-calabrese-sentence-032609.article | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=14 Mob Hits Gets Killer 12-Year Sentence | first=Steve | last=Warmbir | date=March 26, 2009}}</ref>
