The '''French campaign against Korea of 1866''' is also known as '''Byeong-in yangyo''' (''Western disturbance of the byeong-in year''). It refers to the [[France|French]] invasion of [[Ganghwa Island]] in [[Korea]] in [[Punitive Expedition|retaliation]] for the earlier execution by Korea's [[Joseon Dynasty]] of French [[Catholic]] priests proselytizing in that country. The encounter, which lasted nearly six weeks, was the first armed encounter between Korea and a [[Western world|Western power]]. The overall result was a French retreat and a check on its influence in the region{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. The violent encounter also confirmed Korea in its isolationism for another decade, until [[Japan]] forced it to end its isolationism in 1876 through the threat of military force (see [[Treaty of Ganghwa]]).

==Background==
[[Image:Taewongun.jpg|thumb|190px|left|The regent [[Heungseon Daewongun]].]]
Throughout the [[Joseon Dynasty]], Korea maintained a policy of strict [[isolationism]] from the outside world (interaction with the Qing dynasty and occasional trading with [[Japan]] through [[Tsushima Domain|Tsushima]]). However, it did not succeed entirely in sealing itself off from foreign contact. Catholic missionaires had begun to show an interest in Korea as early as the 16th century with their arrival in China and Japan.

Through Korean envoy missions to the [[Qing]] court in the 18th century, foreign ideas, including Christianity, began to enter Korea and by the late 18th century Korea had its first native Christians. However, it was only in the mid 19th century that the first western Catholic missionaries began to enter Korea. This was done by stealth, either via the Korean border with Manchuria or the Yellow Sea. These French missionaries of the [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]] arrived in Korea in the 1840s to proselytize to a growing Korean flock. Bishop [[Sim<U+00E9>on-Fran<U+00E7>ois Berneux]], appointed in 1856 as head of the infant Korean Catholic church, estimated in 1859 that the number of Korean faithful had reached nearly 17,000.<ref>Dallet, 452.</ref>

[[Image:St-Berneux.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Bishop [[Sim<U+00E9>on-Fran<U+00E7>ois Berneux|Berneux]] of the [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]] was tortured and then beheaded on 7 March 1866.<ref>[http://www.sspxasia.com/Newsletters/2001/Jan-Mar/A-Korean-Martyr-for-the-Society-of-St-Pius-X.htm Source]</ref>]]
At first, the Korean court turned a blind eye to such incursions. This attitude changed abruptly, however, with the enthronement of the fourteen year old [[King Gojong of Joseon|King Gojong]] in 1864. By Korean tradition, the regency in the case of a minority would go to the ranking dowager queen, In this case, it was the conservative mother of the previous crown prince, who had died before he could ascend the throne. The new king<U+2019>s father, [[Yi Ha-ung]], a wily and ambitious man in his early forties, was given the traditional title of the unreigning father of a king: [[Heungseon Daewongun]], or <U+201C>Prince of the Great Court<U+201D>.

Though the Heungseon Daewongun<U+2019>s authority at court was not official, stemming in fact from the traditional imperative in Confucian societies for sons to obey their fathers, he quickly seized the initiative and began to control state policy. He became one of the most effective and forceful leaders of the 500-year-old Joseon Dynasty. With the aged dowager regent<U+2019>s blessing, the Heungseon Daewongun set out upon a dual campaign of both strengthening central authority and Korean isolation from the disintegrating traditional order outside its borders. By the time the Heungseon Daewongun assumed de facto control of the government in 1864 there were twelve French Jesuit priests living and preaching in Korea and an estimated 23,000 native Korean converts.<ref>Kane (1999), 2.</ref>

[[Image:Pierre Henri Dorie Korea 1864.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Pierre Henri Dori<U+00E9>]] of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, also martyred in Korea in 1866.]]

In January 1866, Russian ships appeared on the east coast of Korea demanding trading and residency rights in what seemed an echo of the demands made on China by other western powers. Korean Christians with connections at court saw in this an opportunity to advance their cause and suggested an alliance between France and Korea to repel the Russian advances, suggesting further that this alliance could be negotiated through Bishop Berneux. The Heungseon Daewongun seemed open to this idea, but it might have been a ruse to bring the head of the Korean Catholic Church out into the open. Berneux was summoned to the capital, but upon his arrival in February 1866, he was seized and executed. A round-up then began of the other French Catholic priests and Korean converts.

Several factors contributed to the Heungseon Daewongun<U+2018>s decision to crack down on the Catholics. Perhaps the most obvious was the lesson provided by China, which had apparently reaped nothing but hardship and humiliation from its dealing with the western powers, seen most recently in its disastrous defeat during the [[Second Opium War]]. No doubt also fresh in the Heungseon Daewongun<U+2018>s mind was the example of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] in China, which had been infused with Christian doctrines. 1865 had seen poor harvests in Korea as well as social unrest, which may have contributed to a heightened sensitivity to the foreign creed. The crackdown may also have been related to attempts to combat factional cliques at court, where Christianity had made some inroads.

[[Image:AmiralRoze.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Pierre-Gustave Roze|Rear Admiral Roze]] was commander of the French Far Eastern Squadron.]]
As a result of the Korean dragnet all but three of the French missionaries were captured and executed: among them were Bishop Sim<U+00E9>on Berneux, Bishop Antoine Daveluy, Father Just de Breteni<U+00E8>res, Father Louis Beaulieu, Father Pierre Henri Dori<U+00E9>, Father Pierre Auma<U+00EE>tre, Father Luc Martin Huin, all of them members of the Paris Foreign Missions Society and canonized by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 6 May 1984. An untold number of Korean Catholics also met their end (estimations run around 10,000),<ref>"It is estimated than 10,000 were killed within a few months" [http://www.net4war.com/e-revue/dossiers/coree/Roze/roze03.htm Source]</ref> many being executed at a place called [[Jeoldu-san]] in Seoul on the banks of the Han River.

In late June 1866, one of the three surviving French missionaries, Father F<U+00E9>lix-Claire Ridel, managed to escape via a fishing vessel, thanks to 11 native converts, and make his way to Chefoo (today known as [[Yantai]]), China in early July 1866.<ref>Jean-Marie Thi<U+00E9>baud, La pr<U+00E9>sence fran<U+00E7>aise en Cor<U+00E9>e de la fin du XVIII<U+00E8>me si<U+00E8>cle <U+00E0> nos jours, p.20</ref> Fortuitously in Tianjin at the time of Ridel<U+2018>s arrival was the commander of the French Far Eastern Squadron, Rear Admiral [[Pierre-Gustave Roze]]. Hearing of the massacre and the affront to French national honor, Roze determined to launch a [[punitive expedition]]. In this, he was strongly supported by the acting French consul in Peking, Henri de Bellonet.<ref>[http://books.google.be/books?id=nbcJW84i48QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Jean-Marie+Thi%C3%A9baud,+La+pr%C3%A9sence+fran%C3%A7aise+en+Cor%C3%A9e+de+la+fin+du+XVIII%C3%A8me+si%C3%A8cle+%C3%A0+nos+jours&source=bl&ots=WYsZm_0zOZ&sig=ooM30Xac-S_dxoxm_EUQmjt6K4g&hl=fr&ei=sNa6Tf7sNcGZOoKWnLgF&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Jean-Marie Thi<U+00E9>baud, La pr<U+00E9>sence fran<U+00E7>aise en Cor<U+00E9>e de la fin du XVIII<U+00E8>me si<U+00E8>cle <U+00E0> nos jours, p.20]</ref>

On the French side, there were also compelling reasons behind the decision to launch a punitive expedition. These had to do with increasing violence against Christian missionaries and converts in the Chinese interior, which after the Second Opium War in 1860 had been opened up to westerners. As Korea was a nominal vassal of China, the massacre of westerners and Christians in Korea was seen by diplomatic and military authorities in the context of anti-Western behavior in China. Many believed a firm response to such acts of violence was necessary to maintain national prestige and authority.

In response to the event, the French [[charg<U+00E9> d'affaires]] in [[Beijing]], Henri de Bellonet, took a number of intitiatives without consulting with [[Quai d'Orsay]]. Bellonet sent a note to the [[Zongli Yamen]] threatening to occupy Korea,<ref>Jean-Marie Thi<U+00E9>baud, La pr<U+00E9>sence fran<U+00E7>aise en Cor<U+00E9>e de la fin du XVIII<U+00E8>me si<U+00E8>cle <U+00E0> nos jours, p.21</ref> and he also gave the French Naval Commander in the Far East, rear admiral [[Pierre-Gustave Roze]] instruction to launch a punitive expedition against Korea, to which Roze responded : "Since [the kingdom of] Choson killed nine French priests, we shall avenge by killing 9,000 Koreans."<ref>Jean-Marie Thi<U+00E9>baud, La pr<U+00E9>sence fran<U+00E7>aise en Cor<U+00E9>e de la fin du XVIII<U+00E8>me si<U+00E8>cle <U+00E0> nos jours, p.21</ref>

==Preliminaries (10 September <U+2013> 3 October 1866)==
[[Image:AdmiralRoze.jpg|thumb|200px|Admiral Roze (centre) and a quarter of his sailors, on the frigate ''Guerri<U+00E8>re''. Circa 1865 photograph, during a visit in Nagasaki harbour.]]
Though the French diplomatic and naval authorities in China were eager to launch an expedition, they were stymied by the almost total absence of any detailed information on Korea, including any navigational charts. Prior to the actual expedition, Rear Admiral Roze decided to undertake a smaller surveying expedition along the Korean coast,<ref>Jean-Marie Thi<U+00E9>baud, La pr<U+00E9>sence fran<U+00E7>aise en Cor<U+00E9>e de la fin du XVIII<U+00E8>me si<U+00E8>cle <U+00E0> nos jours, p.21</ref> especially along the waterway leading to the Korean capital of [[Seoul]]. This was done in late September and early October 1866. These preliminaries resulted in some rudimentary navigational charts of the waters around Ganghwa Island and the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] leading to Seoul. The treacherous nature of these waters, however, also convinced Roze that any movement against the fortified Korean capital with his limited numbers and large hulled vessels was impossible. Instead, he opted to seize and occupy Ganghwa Island, which commanded the entrance to the Han River, in the hopes of blockading the waterway to the capital during the important harvest season and thus forcing demands and reparations on the Korean court.

The nature that these demands were to take was never fully determined. In Peking, the French consul Bellonet had made outrageous (and as it turned out unofficial){{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} demands that the Korean monarch forfeit his crown and cede sovereignty to France.<ref>Jean-Marie Thi<U+00E9>baud, La pr<U+00E9>sence fran<U+00E7>aise en Cor<U+00E9>e de la fin du XVIII<U+00E8>me si<U+00E8>cle <U+00E0> nos jours, p.21</ref> Such a stance was not in keeping with the more circumspect goals of Rear Admiral Roze, who hoped to force reparations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} In any case, the demands of Bellonet were never officially endorsed by the French government of [[Napoleon III]] Bellonet would later be severely reprimanded for his importunate blusterings.<ref>Kane (1999), 20.</ref>

==Expedition (11 October<U+2013>12 November 1866)==
[[Image:LaGuerriere.jpg|thumb|The French frigate ''Guerri<U+00E8>re'' commanded by Admiral Roze was the lead ship in the French campaign against Korea. Here the ship is photographed in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] harbour around 1865.]]

On 11 October, Admiral Roze left Chefoo with one frigate (''Guerri<U+00E8>re''), two avisos (''Kien<U+2013>Chan'' and ''D<U+00E9>roul<U+00E8>de''), two gunboats (''Lebrethon'' and ''Tardif'') and two corvettes (''Laplace'' and ''Primauguet''), as well as almost 300 [[Fusiliers Marins|Naval Fusiliers]] from their post in Yokohama, Japan. The total number of French troops is estimated at 800.<ref><U+201C>Exp<U+00E9>dition de Cor<U+00E9>e:Extrait du Cahier de Jeanne Frey<U+201D>. In U, Cheolgu, ''19 segi yeolgang gwa hanbando'' [the great powers and the Korean peninsula in 19th century]. (Seoul: Beobmunsa, 1999), p. 216</ref> On 16 October, a group of 170 Naval Fusiliers landed on Ganghwa island, seized the fortress which controlled the Han river, and occupied the fortified city of Ganghwa itself. On Ganghwa Island, the Naval Fusiliers managed to seize several fortified positions, as well as booty such as flags, cannons, 8,000 muskets, 23 boxes of silver ingots and few ones of gold, and various lacquer works, jades, and manuscripts and paintings that comprised the [[Kyujanggak|royal library]] (Oikyujanggak) on the island.<ref>Jean-Marie Thi<U+00E9>baud, La pr<U+00E9>sence fran<U+00E7>aise en Cor<U+00E9>e de la fin du XVIII<U+00E8>me si<U+00E8>cle <U+00E0> nos jours, p.22</ref>

From his earlier exploratory expedition, Roze knew it was impossible for him to lead a fleet of limited force up the treacherous and shallow Han River to the Korean capital and satisfied himself instead with a <U+201C>coup de main<U+201D> on the coast.<ref>Marc Orange, <U+201C>Exp<U+00E9>dition de l<U+2018>amiral Roze en Cor<U+00E9>e.<U+201D> ''Revue du Cor<U+00E9>e'', 30 (Fall 1976), 56.</ref> On the mainland across the narrow channel from Ganghwa Island, however, the French offensive was met with stiff resistance from the troops of General Yi Yong-Hui, to whom Roze sent several letters asking for reparation, without success. A major blow to the French expedition came on 26 October, when 120 French Naval Fusiliers landed briefly on the Korean mainland in an attempt to seize a small fortification at Munsusansong (depicted in the illustration above). As the landing party came ashore they were met by brisk fire from the Korean defenders.

If the monastery of Munsusansong fell into French hands, the way to [[Seoul]] would be open, so, the 7 October, a second landing party was launched by Roze. 160 Naval Fusiliers attacked the monastery of Munsusansong (Mt. Munsu Fort) defended by 543 Korean "Tiger Hunters".<ref>Jean-Marie Thi<U+00E9>baud, La pr<U+00E9>sence fran<U+00E7>aise en Cor<U+00E9>e de la fin du XVIII<U+00E8>me si<U+00E8>cle <U+00E0> nos jours, p.23</ref> Three French soldiers were killed and 36 injured before a retreat was called.<ref>Jean-Marie Thi<U+00E9>baud, La pr<U+00E9>sence fran<U+00E7>aise en Cor<U+00E9>e de la fin du XVIII<U+00E8>me si<U+00E8>cle <U+00E0> nos jours, p.23</ref> Except for continued bombing and surveying activity around Ganghwa and the mouth of the Han River, French forces now largely fortified themselves in and around the city of Ganghwa.

Roze then sent a new letter, asking for the release of the two remaining French missionaries whom he had reason to believe were imprisoned. No answer was forthcoming, but it became clear from activity seen on the mainland across the narrow straits that Korean forces were mobilizing daily. On 9 November, the French were again checked when they attempted to seize a fortified monastery on the southern coast of Ganghwa called Jeongdeung<U+2013>sa. Here again stiff Korean resistance, coupled by the overwhelming numerical superiority of the Korean defenders, now numbering 10 000 men,<ref>Jean-Marie Thi<U+00E9>baud, La pr<U+00E9>sence fran<U+00E7>aise en Cor<U+00E9>e de la fin du XVIII<U+00E8>me si<U+00E8>cle <U+00E0> nos jours, p.23</ref> forced a French retreat with dozens of casualties but no deaths.

Soon thereafter, with winter approaching and the Korean forces growing stronger, Roze made the strategic decision to evacuate. Before doing so, orders were given to bombard the government buildings on Ganghwa Island and to carry off the varied contents of official storehouses there. It was also learned around this time that the two missing missionaries feared captured in Korea had in fact managed to escape to China. This news contributed to the decision to leave.

All told the French suffered three dead and approximately 35 wounded.<ref>Numbers vary according to the source but they are nearly all unanimous in providing the number of French dead. See for instance, Ch. Martin, <U+201C>Exp<U+00E9>dition de Cor<U+00E9>e en 1866.<U+201D> ''Le Spectateur militaire'' (1883), p. 265.</ref> In retreating from Korea, Roze attempted to lessen the extent of his retreat by stating that with his limited means, there was little more he could have accomplished, but that his actions would have a dissuasive effect upon the Korean government:

:"The expedition I just accomplished, however modest as it is, may have prepared the ground for a more serious one if deemed necessary,... The expedition deeply shocked the Korean Nation, by showing her claimed invulnerability was but an illusion. Lastly, the destruction of one of the avenues of Seoul, and the considerable losses suffered by the Korean government should render it more cautious in the future. The objective I had fixed to myself is thus fully accomplished, and the murder of our missionaries has been avenged." report of 15 November by Admiral Roze<ref>"L'exp<U+00E9>dition que je viens de faire, si modeste qu'elle soit, en aura pr<U+00E9>par<U+00E9> une plus s<U+00E9>rieuse si elle est jug<U+00E9>e n<U+00E9>cessaire,....Elle aura d'ailleurs profond<U+00E9>ment frapp<U+00E9> l'esprit de la Nation Cor<U+00E9>enne en lui prouvant que sa pr<U+00E9>tendue invuln<U+00E9>rabilit<U+00E9> n'<U+00E9>tait que chim<U+00E9>rique. Enfin la destruction d'un des boulevards de Seoul et la perte consid<U+00E9>rable que nous avons fait <U+00E9>prouver au gouvernement cor<U+00E9>en ne peuvent manquer de le rendre plus circonspect.

The European residents in China considered the results of the expedition minimal and demanded unsuccessfully a larger expedition for the following spring.

After this expedition, Roze with most his fleet returned to [[Japan]], where they were able to welcome the first [[French military mission to Japan (1867<U+2013>1868)]] in the harbour of [[Yokohama]] on 13 January 1867. The French government ordered the military to leave as a result of heavy losses in the [[French intervention in Mexico]].

===Ancient Korean books===
[[File:Korean text French Library.jpg|thumb|left|One of the Korean texts of the French National Library.]]
The books seized by the French at Ganghwa, some 297 volumes altogether dating from between the 14th and 19th centuries, went on to become the core of the Korea collection in the [[Biblioth<U+00E8>que nationale de France|Biblioth<U+00E8>que Nationale de France]].<ref>"The 297 volumes of texts document court protocol consulted by Korea's last ruling monarchy, the Joseon dynasty, from the 14th to 19th centuries" [http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AC0I920101113 Reuters 12 Nov 2010]</ref> In 2010 it was revealed that the French government was planning to return the books on a renewable lease to Korea, despite the fact that French law generally prohibited the cession of museum property.<ref>"France has agreed to return on a permanent lease basis a collection of royal documents considered national treasures by South Korea and seized by the French navy in the 19th century, Seoul said on Saturday."

In June 2011 celebrations were held in the port city of [[Incheon]] to commemorate their final return. The collection is now being stored in the [[National Museum of Korea]].<ref>"S.

==Epilogue==
In the course of these events, in August 1866, an American ship [[General Sherman incident|''General Sherman'']] foundered on the coast of Korea. Some of the sailors were massacred, but the [[United States]] could not obtain reparations. The United States offered France a combined operation, but the project was abandoned due to the relatively low interest for Korea at that time. An intervention happened in 1871, with the [[United States Korean expedition]].

The Korean government would finally agree to open the country in 1876, when a fleet of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] was sent under the orders of [[Kuroda Kiyotaka]], leading to the [[Treaty of Ganghwa]].
