'''''Procynosuchus''''' (Greek: "Before dog crocodile") was a [[cynodont]] from the Late [[Permian]]. It is considered to be one of the earliest and most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] cynodonts. Remains of ''Procynosuchus'' have been found in [[Germany]], [[Zambia]] and [[South Africa]].<ref name="Kemp">T. S. Kemp: ''The Origin and Evolution of Mammals'' Oxford University Press, 2005. ISBN 0-19-850760-7</ref> It was 60&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;ft) long.

As one of the earliest cynodonts, ''Procynosuchus'' has many primitive features, but it also has features that distinguish it from all other early therapsids. Some of these features have been interpreted as adaptations for a semi-aquatic lifestyle. For example, the wide [[zygapophyses]] of the vertebrae allow for a high degree of lateral flexibility, and ''Procynosuchus'' may have used [[anguilliform locomotion]], or eel-like undulation, to swim through the water. The tail of ''Procynosuchus'' is also unusually long for a cynodont. The long [[haemal arch]]es would have given the tail a large lateral surface area for greater propulsion through the water. Relatively flat foot bones may also have been an adaptation toward swimming, as the feet may have been used like paddles. Ridges on the femur are an indication of strong flexor muscles that could have stabilized the leg during limb-driven swimming. When the thigh is pulled back in the water, the lower leg tends to bend forward. Strong flexor muscles would have pulled the lower leg back with the femur, providing the powerful backward thrust that is needed to swim.<ref name=KTS80>{{cite journal |last=Kemp |first=T.S. |year=1980 |title=The primitive cynodont ''Procynosuchus'': structure, function and evolution of the postcranial skeleton  |url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~tskemp/pdfs/prs1980.pdf |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |volume=288 |issue=1027 |pages=217<U+2013>258|bibcode = 1980RSPTB.288..217K |doi = 10.1098/rstb.1980.0001 }}</ref>

==Naming==
''Procynosuchus'' was named by South African paleontologist [[Robert Broom]] in 1937. Broom also named the cynodont ''Cyrbasiodon'' in 1931. Another genus, ''Parathrinaxodon'', was named by Parrington in 1936. These genera are now regarded as synonyms of ''Procynosuchus'', as they represent the same animal. Under the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN), these two names take precedence over ''Procynosuchus'' because they were erected earlier. The names ''Cyrbasiodon'' and ''Parathrinaxodon'' were rarely used after their erection, while the name ''Procynosuchus'' has since become widespread in scientific literature. In a case brought to the ICZN in 2009, some scientists proposed that ''Procynosuchus'' should be a ''nomen conservandum'', or [[conserved name]], making ''Cyrbasiodon'' and ''Parathrinaxodon'' ''nomina rejecta'', or rejected names.<ref name=KA09>{{cite journal |last=Kammerer |first=C.F. |coauthors=and Abdala, F. |year=2009 |title=''Procynosuchus'' Broom, 1937 (Therapsida, Cynodontia): proposed precedence over ''Cyrbasiodon'' Broom, 1931 and ''Parathrinaxodon'' Parrington, 1936  |url=http://iczn.org/content/procynosuchus-broom-1937-therapsida-cynodontia-proposed-precedence-over-cyrbasiodon-broom-19 |journal=Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=64<U+2013>69 |issn=0007-5167}}</ref> IN 2010, the ICZN formally made ''Procynosuchus'' a ''nomen conservandum''.<ref name=ICZN10>{{cite journal |author=ICZN |year=2010 |title=OPINION 2264 (Case 3431) ''Procynosuchus'' Broom, 1937 (Therapsida, Cynodontia): generic name conserved  |url=http://iczn.org/content/opinion-2264-case-3431-procynosuchus-broom-1937-therapsida-cynodontia-generic-name-conserved |journal=Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=348<U+2013>349}}</ref>
