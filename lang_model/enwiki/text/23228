'''Klaus Zehelein''' (born September 5, 1940, in Frankfurt am Main), is a German [[dramaturge]]. He is currently president of the Munich {{ill|de|Bayerische Theaterakademie August Everding}}. Zehelein is also president of the association of German theaters, [[Deutscher B<U+00FC>hnenverein]]. For fifteen years, from 1991 until 2006, Zehelein was [[Intendant|artistic director]] of the [[Staatsoper Stuttgart]]. Critic Gerhard Rohde, summing up Zehelein's theatre work at the Stuttgart opera, says "Zehelein does not view opera as a culinary phenomenon. For him opera is an extremely complex matter, where all arts <U+2013> as well as social, philosophical, historic, utopic and other aspects <U+2013> unite. This complexity of opera merits being perceived, being seen, being experienced; thus all works that end up performed on stage, are rigorously analyzed beforehand. He who says this results in thinned-out, merely sophisticated opera performances, missed out substantially in the Zehelein-Era in Stuttgart."<ref name="operundtanz">Gerhard Rohne, ''Oper und Tanz'', April, 2006, [http://www.operundtanz.de/archiv/2006/04/portrait-zehelein-jonas.shtml] - ''this quote is translated into somewhat simplified English.''</ref>

== Education and professional activity ==

Zehelein studied German literature, [[musicology]] and philosophy in the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]]. Among his teachers were the philosophers [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]]. Although not a composer himself, Zehelein participated in the [[Darmst<U+00E4>dter Ferienkurse|Darmstadt International Summer Courses for New Music]] from 1959 to 1966. Here he met composers [[Luigi Nono]] and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], which would influence Zehelein's future artistic developement.<ref>Teresa Pieschac<U+00F3>n-Raphael, ''Crescendo'' magazine Interview (in German)[http://www.crescendo.de/auf-einen-kaffee-mit-klaus-zehelein-170/, retrieved July, 2013]</ref> Zehelein began his professional activity at the theater in Kiel in 1967, then became chief dramaturge in [[Oldenburgisches Staatstheater|Oldenburg]].

Under Zehelein's direction the Stuttgart Opera was an ensemble based opera company. The sopranos [[Catherine Naglestad]] and [[Eva-Maria Westbroek]] were members of his permanent ensemble, tenor [[Jonas Kaufmann]] a frequent guest artist. Music directors were [[Gabriele Ferro]] and [[Lothar Zagrosek]]. The conductor [[Nicola Luisotti]] conducted frequently during Zehelein's era.<ref name=JT /><ref>Television documentary.

Dramaturg und Intendant'', Europ<U+00E4>ische Verlagsanstalt/Rotbuch Verlag, Hamburg 2000,</ref>

In his fifteen years Zehelein explored most of the 20th century's opera standard repertoire, such as [[Alban Berg|Berg's]] ''[[Wozzeck]]'' and ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]]'s ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk]]'', as well as many lesser known works <U+2013> [[Franz Schreker|Schreker]]'s ''[[Die Gezeichneten]]'', [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]]'s ''[[Doktor Faust]]'', Nono's ''[[Al gran sole carico d'amore]]'' and ''[[Intolleranza 1960]]''. The was performed over numerous seasons in a total of 29 performances.<ref>Joachim Knape, editor, ''Medienrhetorik'', Attempto (2004),ISBN 978-3893083701, p.78</ref> Zehelein performed works of the composers [[Helmut Lachenmann|Lachenmann]], Jungy Pagh Pan, Hans Zender and Rolf Rihm.<ref>Susanne Fontaine, "Tutzing, 7. bis 9.

Zehelein argued that as [[Richard Wagner]] wrote the four music-dramas of the ''Ring'' over a many years, changing dramatugical ideas in the process, each opera could be treated as a stand alone work. Zehelein invited four directors for his ring, thus giving each opera dramatic independence. The resulting ''Stuttgarter Ring'' brought much discussion and recognition to the Stuttgart Opera.<ref>Larson Powell, Review, ''Narben des Gesamtkunstwerks: Wagners Ring des Nibelungen by Richard Klein'', Cambridge Opera Journal, Vol. 17, No. 3 (Nov., 2005), pp. 303<U+2013>308</ref><ref>Reviews in the Opera Quaterly: 1)The Stuttgart Ring, 1999<U+2013>2000.Opera Quarterly; Spring/Summer2007, Vol. 23 Issue 2/3, p321; 2)Moravcsik, Andrew ''Everyday Totalitarianism: Reflections on the Stuttgart Ring''.

Zehelein created the Forum Neues Musiktheater, an institute attached to the Stuttgart Opera. ''"Here new compositions were not only studied and presented,"'' says the critic Gerhard Rohde, ''"but more important was the work-nature of the institute: a laboratory, in which young, and not so young composers develop their ideas, and together with musicians, singers, dancers, and new media realize these ideas into a scenic reality"''<ref name="operundtanz" /> Zehelein also founded the ''Junge Oper'' (an institute dedicated to performing opera for young audiences).<ref>Andreas Hauff, ''Tristan und Isolde sind jungZehn Jahre Junge Oper Stuttgart'', March, 2006, oper und tanz</ref><ref>[http://reseo.org/opera-house/junge-oper-stuttgart "Junge Oper Stuttgart"] on reseo.org. Retrieved 28 July 2013</ref>

Numerous CD and DVD productions document Zehelein's interest in modern works and new staging concepts. Stuttgart CD productions include Nono's ''Intolleranza 1960''(1995) and ''Al Gran Sole Carico D'Amore'' (2001), as well as [[Helmut Lachenmann|Lachenmann]]'s ''Das M<U+00E4>dchen mit den Schwefelh<U+00F6>lzern'' (2003); Zehelein's productions on DVD: [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Alcina]]'' (1999), [[Karl Amadeus Hartmann|Hartmann]]'s ''[[Simplicius Simplicissimus]]'' (2005), [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[La finta giardiniera]]'' [2006) and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'',(2003).<ref>David J. levin Richard Wagner, Fritz Lang, and the Nibelungen Princeton University Press, (1999), ISBN 978-0691049717.</ref>
