'''Andrew Jackson''' (March 15, 1767 &ndash; June 8, 1845) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|seventh]] [[President of the United States]] (1829&ndash;1837). He was [[List of governors of Florida|military governor]] of [[Florida Territory|pre-admission Florida]] (1821), commander of the American forces at the [[Battle of New Orleans]] (1815), and [[eponym]] of the era of [[Jacksonian democracy]]. A polarizing figure who dominated [[Second Party System|American politics]] in the 1820s and 1830s, his political ambition combined with widening political participation, shaping the modern [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]].<ref>[[Sean Wilentz|Wilentz, Sean]]. ''Andrew Jackson'' (2005), p. 8, 35.</ref>

His legacy is now seen as mixed, as a protector of popular democracy and individual liberty for American citizens, checkered by his support for [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[Indian removal]].<ref name=legacy1>Finkelman, Paul (2006). "Jackson, Andrew (1767<U+2013>1845)," in ''Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties'', 3 vols., Routledge (CRC Press), ISBN 978-0-415-94342-0, vol. 2 (G-Q), p.

As he based his career in developing [[Tennessee]], Jackson was the first president primarily associated with the [[American frontier]].

==Early life and career==
Jackson was born to [[Presbyterian]] [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] colonists Andrew and Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson, on March 15, 1767, approximately two years after they had emigrated from [[Ireland]].<ref name="birthplace">{{cite web |title=Andrew Jackson |work=Information Services Branch, State Library of North Carolina |url=http://statelibrary.dcr.state.nc.us/nc/bio/public/jackson.htm}}</ref><ref name="Carrick">{{cite web |title=Andrew Jackson Cottage and US Rangers Centre |work=[[Northern Ireland Tourist Board]] |url=http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/product.aspx?ProductID=2801}}</ref> Jackson's father was born in [[Carrickfergus]], [[County Antrim]], in Ireland around 1738.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gullan|first=Harold I. |title=First fathers: the men who inspired our Presidents|publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Hoboken, N.J. : J|date=c2004|url=http://books.google.com/?id=YSt1AAAAMAAJ&q=%22Andrew+Jackson,+Sr.%22+-inpublisher:icon&dq=%22Andrew+Jackson,+Sr.%22+-inpublisher:icon&cd=9|isbn=0471465976 |oclc=53090968 |id= {{lccn|2003||020625}} |pages= xii, 308 p. : ill. ; 25 cm | accessdate=January 14, 2010}}</ref> He married Elizabeth, sold his land and emigrated to America in 1765. The Jacksons probably landed in Pennsylvania and made their way overland to the Scotch-Irish community in the [[Waxhaws]] region, straddling the border between [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Jackson had two brothers, Hugh (born 1763) and Robert (born 1764). Jackson's father injured himself while lifting a log, and died February 1767,<ref>{{cite web |author=Remini, Robert |title=Andrew Jackson |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |date=2008-11-02 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/andrewjackson.htm |accessdate=2009-05-04 }}</ref> at the age of 29, three weeks before Jackson was born.  The house that Jackson's parents lived in is now preserved as the [[Andrew Jackson Centre]] and is open to the public. Jackson was born in the Waxhaws area, but his exact birth site was the subject of conflicting lore in the area. He claimed to have been born in a cabin just inside South Carolina.<ref>{{cite web

}} Controversies about Jackson's birthplace went far beyond the dispute between North and South Carolina. Because his origins were humble and obscure compared to those of his predecessors, wild rumors abounded about Jackson's past. Joseph Nathan Kane, in his almanac-style book ''Facts About the Presidents'', lists no fewer than eight localities, including two foreign countries, that were mentioned in the popular press as Jackson's "real" birthplace&nbsp;<U+2013> including Ireland, where both of Jackson's parents were born.</ref>

Jackson received a sporadic education in the local "old-field" school. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], Jackson, at age thirteen, joined a local regiment as a courier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/cgi-bin/page.cgi/aa/jackson|title=Andrew Jackson|publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=2007-06-03}}</ref> His eldest brother, Hugh, died from heat exhaustion during the [[Battle of Stono Ferry]], on June 20, 1779.  Jackson and his brother Robert were captured by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] and held as [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]; they nearly starved to death in captivity. When Jackson refused to clean the boots of a British officer, the irate [[Red coat (British army)|redcoat]] slashed at him with a sword, giving him scars on his left hand and head, as well as an intense hatred for the British.<ref name="Tread">{{cite book|last=Crocker III|first=H.

Robert died a few days after their mother secured their release, on April 27, 1781.  After his mother was assured Jackson would recover, she volunteered to nurse prisoners of war on board two ships in Charleston harbor, where there had been an outbreak of cholera. She died from the disease and was buried in an unmarked grave in November 1781.  Jackson was orphaned by age 14.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Generals: Andrew Jackson, Sir Edward Pakenham, and the Road to the Battle of New Orleans|isbn=978-0-8147-6717-7|first=Benton Rain|last=Patterson|year=2005|publisher=NYU Press|chapter=The Immigrants<U+2019> Son|chapterurl=http://www.nyupress.org/webchapters/0814767176chapt1.pdf}}</ref>  Jackson's entire immediate family had died from hardships during the war for which Jackson blamed the British.

Jackson was the last U.S. President to have been a veteran of the American Revolution, and the second president to have been a [[prisoner of war]] (Washington was captured by the French in the [[French and Indian War]]).
[[File:Andrew-Jackson-disobeys-British-officer-1780.png|thumb|left|Jackson refusing to clean a British officer's [[boot]]s (1876 [[lithography|lithograph]]).]]
In 1781, Jackson worked for a time in a [[saddle]]-maker's shop.<ref name=Paletta>{{cite book |last=Paletta|first=Lu Ann |coauthors=Worth, Fred L |title=The World Almanac of Presidential Facts |publisher=World Almanac Books |year=1988 |isbn=0345348885}}</ref> Later, he taught school and studied law in [[Salisbury, North Carolina]]. In 1787, he was admitted to the bar, and moved to [[Jonesboro, Tennessee|Jonesborough]], in what was then the Western District of North Carolina and later became Tennessee.

Though his legal education was scanty, Jackson knew enough to be a [[country lawyer]] on the [[American frontier|frontier]]. Since he was not from a distinguished family, he had to make his career by his own merits; soon he began to prosper in the rough-and-tumble world of frontier law. Most of the actions grew out of disputed land-claims, or from [[assault (tort)|assault]] and [[battery (tort)|battery]]. In 1788, he was appointed Solicitor of the Western District and held the same position in the territorial government of Tennessee after 1791.

In 1796, Jackson was a delegate to the Tennessee constitutional convention. When Tennessee achieved statehood that year, Jackson was elected its [[U.S. House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]]. In 1797, he was elected [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] as a [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican]]. He resigned within a year. In 1798, he was appointed a judge of the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]], serving until 1804.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Jackson, Andrew, (1767&nbsp;<U+2013> 1845), |publisher=[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]]}}</ref>

Besides his legal and political career, Jackson prospered as a slave owner, planter, and merchant. In 1803 he owned a lot, and built a home and the first general store in [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]]. In 1804, he acquired [[The Hermitage (Tennessee)|the Hermitage]], a {{convert|640|acre|km2|sing=on}} plantation in [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], near [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].  Jackson later added {{convert|360|acre|km2}} to the farm.  The plantation eventually grew to {{convert|1050|acres|0|abbr=on}}.  The slaves that Jackson owned did the hardest work on the plantation.  The primary crop was [[cotton]], grown by enslaved workers. Jackson started with nine slaves, by 1820 he held as many as 44, and later held up to 150 slaves. Throughout his lifetime Jackson owned as many as 300 slaves.<ref>Remini (2000), p.51 cites 1820 census; mentions later figures up to 150 without noting a source.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehermitage.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=36&Itemid=49|The |title=Hermitage |publisher=Thehermitage.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-06}}</ref>

Jackson was a major land speculator in West Tennessee after he had negotiated the sale of the land from the [[Chickasaw Nation]] in 1818 (termed the [[Jackson Purchase (U.S. historical region)|Jackson Purchase]]) and was one of the three original investors who founded [[Memphis, Tennessee]] in 1819 (see [[History of Memphis, Tennessee]]).<ref>[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=J008 Jackson Purchase] in the Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture</ref>

==Military career==
===War of 1812===
{{Main|Creek War|Battle of New Orleans}}

Jackson was appointed commander of the Tennessee militia in 1801, with the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]].

During the [[War of 1812]], [[Tecumseh]] incited the "[[Red Stick]]" [[Creek people|Creek]] Indians of northern Alabama and Georgia to attack white settlements. Four hundred settlers were killed in the [[Fort Mims Massacre]]. In the resulting [[Creek War]], Jackson commanded the American forces, which included Tennessee militia, U.S. [[Regular Army (United States)|regular]]s, and [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], and Southern Creek Indians.

Jackson defeated the Red Stick Creeks at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] in 1814. Eight hundred "Red Sticks" were killed, but Jackson spared chief [[William Weatherford]]. [[Sam Houston]] and [[David Crockett]] served under Jackson in this campaign.  After the victory, Jackson imposed the [[Treaty of Fort Jackson]] upon both the Northern Creek enemies and the Southern Creek allies, wresting twenty million acres (81,000&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) from all Creeks for white settlement. Jackson was appointed Major General after this action.

General Andrew Jackson stands on the parapet of his makeshift defenses as his troops repulse attacking [[93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot|Highlander]]s, as imagined by painter [[Edward Percy Moran]] in 1910.]]
Jackson's service in the War of 1812 against the United Kingdom was conspicuous for bravery and success. When British forces threatened [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], Jackson took command of the defenses, including militia from several western states and territories. He was a strict officer but was popular with his troops. It was said he was "tough as old hickory" wood on the battlefield, which gave him his nickname. In the [[Battle of New Orleans]] on January 8, 1815, Jackson's 5,000 soldiers won a victory over 7,500 British. At the end of the day, the British had 2,037 casualties: 291 dead (including three senior generals), 1,262 wounded, and 484 captured or missing. The Americans had 71 casualties: 13 dead, 39 wounded, and 19 missing.<ref>Remini, Robert V. (1999) The battle of New Orleans, New York: Penguin Books. p. 285</ref>

The war, and especially this victory, made Jackson a national hero. He received the [[Thanks of Congress]] and a gold medal by resolution of February 27, 1815. [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] later commented in [[Democracy in America]] that Jackson "...was raised to the Presidency, and has been maintained there, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained, twenty years ago, under the walls of New Orleans."

===First Seminole War===
{{Main|Seminole Wars}}

Jackson served in the military again during the [[Seminole Wars|First Seminole War]]. He was ordered by President [[James Monroe]] in December 1817 to lead a campaign in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] against the [[Seminole (tribe)|Seminole]] and Creek Indians. Jackson was also charged with preventing [[Spanish Florida]] from becoming a refuge for runaway slaves. Critics later alleged that Jackson exceeded orders in his Florida actions. His directions were to "terminate the conflict."<ref>Remini, 118.</ref> Jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize Florida. Before going, Jackson wrote to Monroe, "Let it be signified to me through any channel... that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States, and in sixty days it will be accomplished."<ref>Ogg, 66.</ref> Monroe gave Jackson orders that were purposely ambiguous, sufficient for international denials.

[[File:Bustofandrewjackson.jpg|thumb|left|Military governor Jackson was sworn in at [[Plaza Ferdinand VII]] in [[Pensacola, Florida]].]]

The Seminoles attacked Jackson's Tennessee volunteers. The Seminoles' attack, however, left their villages vulnerable, and Jackson burned them and the crops. He found letters that indicated that the Spanish and British were secretly assisting the Indians. Jackson believed that the United States could not be secure as long as Spain and the United Kingdom encouraged Indians to fight, and argued that his actions were undertaken in self-defense. Jackson captured [[Pensacola, Florida]], with little more than some warning shots, and deposed the Spanish governor. He captured and then tried and executed two British subjects, [[Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident|Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot]], who had been supplying and advising the Indians. Jackson's action also struck fear into the Seminole tribes as word spread of his ruthlessness in battle (Jackson was known as "Sharp Knife").

The executions, and Jackson's invasion of territory belonging to Spain, a country with which the U.S. was not at war, created an international incident. Many in the Monroe administration called for Jackson to be [[Censure in the United States|censured]]. Jackson's actions were defended by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Quincy Adams]], an early believer in [[Manifest Destiny]].  When the Spanish minister demanded a "suitable punishment" for Jackson, Adams wrote back, "Spain must immediately [decide] either to place a force in Florida adequate at once to the protection of her territory ... or cede to the United States a province, of which she retains nothing but the nominal possession, but which is, in fact ... a post of annoyance to them."<ref>{{cite web |title=Jefferson and His Colleagues |url=http://etext.virginia.edu/jefferson/grizzard/johnson/johnson13.html |accessdate=2006-10-11 |last=Johnson |first=Allen |year=1920}}</ref>  Adams used Jackson's conquest, and Spain's own weakness, to get Spain to cede Florida to the United States by the [[Adams-On<U+00ED>s Treaty]]. Jackson was subsequently named military governor and served from March 10, 1821, to December 31, 1821.

==Election of 1824==
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1824}}

The Tennessee legislature nominated Jackson for President in 1822. It also elected him U.S. Senator again.
[[File:Andrew Jackson.jpg|thumb|left|Jackson in 1824, painting by [[Thomas Sully]].]]
By 1824, the Democratic-Republican Party had become the only functioning national party. Its Presidential candidates had been chosen by an informal [[Congressional nominating caucus]], but this had become unpopular. In 1824, most of the Democratic-Republicans in Congress boycotted the caucus.  Those who attended backed Treasury Secretary [[William H. Crawford]] for President and [[Albert Gallatin]] for Vice President. A [[Pennsylvania]]n convention nominated Jackson for President a month later, stating that the irregular caucus ignored the "voice of the people" and was a "vain hope that the American people might be thus deceived into a belief that he [Crawford] was the regular democratic candidate."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rutland |first=Robert Allen |title=The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton |pages=48&ndash;49 |year=1995 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |isbn=0826210341}}</ref> Gallatin criticized Jackson as "an honest man and the idol of the worshippers of military glory, but from incapacity, military habits, and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions, altogether unfit for the office."<ref>Adams, Henry. ''The Life of Albert Gallatin'' (1879), 599.</ref>

[[File:Andrew Jackson statue County Courthouse KC Missouri.jpg|thumb|Statue of Jackson as General in front of Jackson County Courthouse in [[Kansas City, Missouri]].]]

Besides Jackson and Crawford, Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]] and House Speaker [[Henry Clay]] were also candidates. Jackson received the most popular votes (but not a majority, and four states had no popular ballot). The [[United States Electoral College|Electoral votes]] were split four ways, with Jackson having a plurality. Since no candidate received a majority, the election was decided by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], which chose Adams. Jackson supporters denounced this result as a "[[corrupt bargain]]" because Clay gave his state's support to Adams, and subsequently Adams appointed Clay as Secretary of State.  As none of Kentucky's electors had initially voted for Adams, and Jackson had won the popular vote, it appeared that Henry Clay had violated the will of the people and substituted his own judgment in return for personal political favors.  Jackson's defeat burnished his political credentials, however; many voters believed the "man of the people" had been robbed by the "corrupt aristocrats of the East."

==Election of 1828==
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1828}}

Jackson resigned from the Senate in October 1825, but continued his quest for the Presidency. The Tennessee legislature again nominated Jackson for President. Jackson attracted Vice President [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Martin Van Buren]], and [[Thomas Ritchie]] into his camp (Van Buren and Ritchie were previous supporters of Crawford). Van Buren, with help from his friends in [[Philadelphia]] and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], revived the old Republican Party, gave it a new name as the Democratic Party, "restored party rivalries," and forged a national organization of durability.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rutland |first=Robert Allen |title=The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton |pages=55&ndash;56 |year=1995 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |isbn=0826210341}}</ref> The Jackson coalition handily defeated Adams in 1828.

During the election, Jackson's opponents referred to him as a "[[Donkey|jackass]]". Jackson liked the name and used the jackass as a symbol for a while, but it died out. However, it later became the symbol for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] when cartoonist [[Thomas Nast]] popularized it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/questions/week174.htm |title=Nickels, Ilona; "How did Republicans pick the elephant, and Democrats the donkey, to represent their parties?"; "Capitol Questions" feature at c-span.com; September 5, 2000 |publisher=C-span.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-06}}</ref>

The campaign was very much a personal one. Although neither candidate personally campaigned, their political followers organized many campaign events. Both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press, which reached a low point when the press accused Jackson's wife [[Rachel Jackson|Rachel]] of bigamy. Though the accusation was true, as were most personal attacks leveled against him during the campaign, it was based on events that occurred many years prior (1791 to 1794). Jackson said he would forgive those who insulted him, but he would never forgive the ones who attacked his wife. Rachel died suddenly on December 22, 1828, before his inauguration, and was buried on Christmas Eve.

===Inauguration===
{{Main|Andrew Jackson 1829 presidential inauguration}}

Jackson was the first President to invite the public to attend the [[White House]] ball honoring his first inauguration. Many poor people came to the inaugural ball in their homemade clothes. The crowd became so large that Jackson's guards could not hold them out of the White House. The White House became so crowded with people that dishes and decorative pieces in the White House began to break. Some people stood on good chairs in muddied boots just to get a look at the President. The crowd had become so wild that the attendants poured punch in tubs and put it on the White House lawn to lure people out of the White House.  Jackson's raucous populism earned him the nickname King Mob.

==Election of 1832==
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1832}}
In the 1832 presidential election, Jackson easily won reelection as the candidate of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] against [[Henry Clay]], of the [[National Republican Party]], and [[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]], of the [[Anti-Masonic Party]]. Jackson jettisoned Vice President [[John C. Calhoun]] because of his support for [[Nullification Crisis|nullification]] and involvement in the [[Petticoat affair]], replacing him with longtime confidant [[Martin Van Buren]] of New York.

In 1835, Jackson managed to reduce the federal debt to only $33,733.05, the lowest it had been since the first fiscal year of 1791.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo1.htm |title=Historical Debt Outstanding - Annual 1791 - 1849 |accessdate=2007-11-25 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work=Public Debt Reports |publisher=Treasury Direct}}</ref> President Jackson is the only president in United States history to have paid off the national debt.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} However, this accomplishment was short lived.

===Electoral College===
Jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to Congress as President.<ref name=firstaddress>{{cite web |title=Andrew Jackson's First Annual Message to Congress |publisher=The American Presidency Project |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29471 |accessdate=2008-03-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Andrew Jackson's Second Annual Message to Congress |publisher=The American Presidency Project |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29472 |accessdate=2008-03-14}}</ref> In his third annual message to Congress, he expressed the view "I have heretofore recommended amendments of the [[United States Constitution|Federal Constitution]] giving the election of President and Vice-President to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term. So important do I consider these changes in our fundamental law that I can not, in accordance with my sense of duty, omit to press them upon the consideration of a new Congress."<ref>{{cite web |title=Andrew Jackson's Third Annual Message to Congress |publisher=The American Presidency Project |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29473 |accessdate=2008-03-14}}</ref> The institution Jackson railed against remains to the present day.

===Spoils system===
{{Main|Spoils system}}

When Jackson became President, he implemented the theory of [[rotation in office]], declaring it "a leading principle in the republican creed."<ref name="firstaddress"/> He believed that rotation in office would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy. To strengthen party loyalty, Jackson's supporters wanted to give the posts to party members. In practice, this meant replacing federal employees with friends or party loyalists.<ref>The [[Spoils System]], as the rotation in office system was called, did not originate with Jackson.  It originated with New York governors in the late 18th and early 19th centuries (most notably [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] and [[DeWitt Clinton]]). [[Thomas Jefferson]] brought it to the [[Executive Branch]] when he replaced Federalist office-holders after becoming President. [http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h965.html The Spoils System versus the Merit System.] Retrieved on 2006-11-21.</ref> However, the effect was not as drastic as expected or portrayed. By the end of his term, Jackson dismissed less than twenty percent of the Federal employees at the start of it.<ref>[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=637 Jacksonian Democracy: The Presidency of Andrew Jackson]. Retrieved on 2006-11-21.</ref>  While Jackson did not start the "spoils system," he did indirectly encourage its growth for many years to come.

===Opposition to the National Bank===
{{Main|Bank War}}

[[File:AJ~bank.JPG|thumb|Democratic cartoon shows Jackson fighting the monster Bank.  "The Bank," Jackson told [[Martin Van Buren]], "is trying to kill me, but I will kill it!"]]

The [[Second Bank of the United States]] was authorized for a twenty year period during [[James Madison]]'s tenure in 1816. As President, Jackson worked to rescind the bank's federal charter. In Jackson's veto message (written by [[George Bancroft]]), the bank needed to be abolished because:

*It concentrated the nation's financial strength in a single institution.
*It exposed the government to control by foreign interests.
*It served mainly to make the rich richer.
*It exercised too much control over members of Congress.
*It favored northeastern states over southern and western states.

Following Jefferson, Jackson supported an "agricultural republic" and felt the Bank improved the fortunes of an "elite circle" of commercial and industrial entrepreneurs at the expense of farmers and laborers. After a titanic struggle, Jackson succeeded in destroying the Bank by vetoing its 1832 re-charter by Congress and by withdrawing U.S. funds in 1833.

[[File:1832bank1.jpg|thumb|1833 Democratic cartoon shows Jackson destroying the [[Second Bank of the United States|devil's Bank]].]]

The bank's money-lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that sprang up. This fed an expansion of credit and speculation. At first, as Jackson withdrew money from the Bank to invest it in other banks, land sales, canal construction, cotton production, and manufacturing boomed.<ref name="digitalhistory">{{cite web|author=Digital History, Steven Mintz |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=640 |title=Digital History |publisher=Digitalhistory.uh.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-06}}</ref> However, due to the practice of banks issuing paper banknotes that were not backed by gold or silver reserves, there was soon rapid inflation and mounting state debts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/biography/jackson/section10.rhtml |title=Sparknotes |publisher=Sparknotes |date= |accessdate=2010-09-06}}</ref> Then, in 1836, Jackson issued the [[Specie Circular]], which required buyers of government lands to pay in "specie" (gold or silver coins). The result was a great demand for specie, which many banks did not have enough of to exchange for their notes. These banks collapsed.<ref name="digitalhistory"/> This was a direct cause of the [[Panic of 1837]], which threw the national economy into a deep depression. It took years for the economy to recover from the damage.

The U.S. Senate censured Jackson on March 28, 1834, for his action in removing U.S. funds from the Bank of the United States. When the Jacksonians had a majority in the Senate, the censure was expunged.

===Nullification crisis===
{{Main|Nullification Crisis}}

Another notable crisis during Jackson's period of office was the "[[Nullification Crisis]]", or "secession crisis," of 1828&nbsp;<U+2013> 1832, which merged issues of sectional strife with disagreements over tariffs. Critics alleged that high tariffs (the "[[Tariff of Abominations]]") on imports of common manufactured goods made in Europe made those goods more expensive than ones from the northern U.S., raising the prices paid by planters in the South. Southern politicians argued that tariffs benefited northern industrialists at the expense of southern farmers.

The issue came to a head when Vice President Calhoun, in the [[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]] of 1828, supported the claim of his home state, [[South Carolina]], that it had the right to "nullify"&mdash;declare void&mdash;the tariff legislation of 1828, and more generally the right of a state to nullify any Federal laws that went against its interests. Although Jackson sympathized with the South in the tariff debate, he was also a strong supporter of a strong union, with effective powers for the central government. Jackson attempted to face down Calhoun over the issue, which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men.

Particularly notable was an incident at the April 13, 1830, Jefferson Day dinner, involving after-dinner toasts.  [[Robert Hayne]] began by toasting to "The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States."  Jackson then rose, and in a booming voice added "Our federal Union: It must be preserved!"&nbsp;<U+2013> a clear challenge to Calhoun.  Calhoun clarified his position by responding "The Union: Next to our Liberty, the most dear!"<ref>Ogg, 164.</ref>

[[File:Andrew Jackson Presidential $1 Coin obverse.jpg|thumb|left|[[Presidential $1 Coin Program|Jackson Presidential Dollar]]]]
The next year, Calhoun and Jackson broke apart politically from one another.  Around this time, the [[Petticoat affair]] caused further resignations from Jackson's cabinet, leading to its reorganization as the "[[Kitchen Cabinet]]".  [[Martin Van Buren]], despite resigning as Secretary of State, played a leading role in the new unofficial cabinet.<ref>[http://ap.grolier.com/article?assetid=0400180-00 Martin Van Buren biography at Encyclopedia Americana]</ref>  At the [[1832 Democratic National Convention|first Democratic National Convention]], privately engineered by members of the Kitchen Cabinet,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Parton |first=James | author-link=James Parton |title=Life of Andrew Jackson |volume=3 |pages=381&ndash;385 |year=2006 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn=1428639292}}.  First published in 1860.</ref>  Van Buren replaced Calhoun as Jackson's running mate.  In December 1832, Calhoun resigned as Vice President to become a U.S. Senator for South Carolina.

In response to South Carolina's nullification claim, Jackson vowed to send troops to [[South Carolina]] to enforce the laws. In December 1832, he issued a resounding proclamation against the "nullifiers," stating that he considered "the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed." South Carolina, the President declared, stood on "the brink of insurrection and treason," and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union for which their ancestors had fought. Jackson also denied the right of secession: "The Constitution... forms a ''government'' not a league... To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States is not a nation."<ref>Syrett, 36. See also: {{cite web |title=President Jackson's Proclamation Regarding Nullification, December 10, 1832 |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/presiden/proclamations/jack01.htm |accessdate=2006-08-10 }}</ref>

Jackson asked Congress to pass a "[[Force Bill]]" explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff, but its passage was delayed until [[protectionism|protectionists]] led by Clay agreed to a reduced Compromise Tariff. The Force Bill and Compromise Tariff passed on March 1, 1833, and Jackson signed both.  The South Carolina Convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance. The Force Bill became moot because it was no longer needed.

===Indian removal===
{{Main|Indian removal}}

[[File:Andrew jackson head.gif|thumb|Official [[White House]] portrait of Jackson.]]
Perhaps the most controversial aspect of Jackson's presidency was his policy regarding [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]], which involved the [[ethnic cleansing]] of several Indian tribes.<ref>In particular, see Schama (2008) p. 325-326</ref><ref>For an attack on Jackson see Cave (2003). 65(6): 1330&ndash;1353.  For a defense see Remini (2001).</ref> Jackson was a leading advocate of a policy known as Indian removal. Jackson had been negotiating treaties and removal policies with Indian leaders for years before his election as president.  Many tribes and portions of tribes had been removed to Arkansas Territory and further west of the Mississippi River without the suffering and tragedies of what later became known as the [[Trail of Tears]].  Further, many white Americans advocated total extermination of the "savages," particularly those who had experienced frontier wars.  Jackson's support of removal policies can be best understood by examination of those prior cases he had personally negotiated, rather than those in post-presidential years.  Nevertheless, Jackson is often held responsible for all that took place in the 1830s.

In his December 8, 1829, First Annual Message to Congress, Jackson stated:

{{quote|This emigration should be voluntary, for it would be as cruel as unjust to compel the aborigines to abandon the graves of their fathers and seek a home in a distant land. But they should be distinctly informed that if they remain within the limits of the States they must be subject to their laws. In return for their obedience as individuals they will without doubt be protected in the enjoyment of those possessions which they have improved by their industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29471 |title=Andrew Jackson: First Annual Message |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=2008-11-01}}</ref>}}

Before his election as president, Jackson had been involved with the issue of Indian removal for over ten years.  The removal of the Native Americans to the west of the [[Mississippi River]] had been a major part of his political agenda in both the 1824 and 1828 presidential elections.<ref>Remini,"Andrew Jackson and the Course of American Freedom, 1822<U+2013>1832" pp. 117, 200</ref>  After his election he signed the [[Indian Removal Act]] into law in 1830. The Act authorized the President to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands further west, outside of existing U.S. state borders.

While frequently frowned upon in the North, and opposed by [[Jeremiah Evarts]] and [[Theodore Frelinghuysen]], the Removal Act was popular in the [[American South|South]], where population growth and the discovery of gold on [[Cherokee]] land had increased pressure on tribal lands. The state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] became involved in a contentious jurisdictional dispute with the Cherokees, culminating in the 1832 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision (''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]''), which ruled that Georgia could not impose its laws upon Cherokee tribal lands. Jackson is often quoted (regarding the decision) as having said, "[[John Marshall]] has made his decision, now let him enforce it!" Whether he said it is disputed.<ref>Cave (2003); Remini (1988).</ref>

In any case, Jackson used the Georgia crisis to pressure Cherokee leaders to sign a removal treaty. A small faction of Cherokees led by [[John Ridge]] negotiated the [[Treaty of New Echota]] with Jackson's representatives. Ridge was not a recognized leader of the Cherokee Nation, and this document was rejected by most Cherokees as illegitimate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historicaldocuments.com/IndianRemovalAct.htm |title=Historical Documents - The Indian Removal Act of 1830 |publisher=Historicaldocuments.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-01}}</ref> Over 15,000 Cherokees signed a petition in protest of the proposed removal; the list was ignored by the Supreme Court and the U.S. legislature, in part due to unfortunate and tragic delays and timing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2959.html |title=PBS.org |publisher=PBS.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-06}}</ref>  The treaty was enforced by Jackson's successor, Van Buren, who ordered 7,000 armed troops to remove the Cherokees.  Due to the infighting between political factions, many Cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered until troops arrived.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.synaptic.bc.ca/ejournal/jackson.htm |title=Indian Removal |publisher=Synaptic.bc.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-09-06}}</ref> This abrupt and forced removal resulted in the deaths of over 4,000 Cherokees on the "[[Trail of Tears]]".

By the 1830s, under constant pressure from settlers, each of the five southern tribes had ceded most of its lands, but sizable self-government groups lived in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. All of these (except the Seminoles) had moved far in the coexistence with whites, and they resisted suggestions that they should voluntarily remove themselves. Their nonviolent methods earned them the title the [[Five Civilized Tribes]].<ref>PBS: Judgement Day. <U+201C>Indian removal.<U+201D> [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2959.html PBS.org] . Retrieved January 12, 2008.</ref>
[[File:A Jackson.jpg|left|thumb|A [[daguerreotype]] of Jackson, in the later years of his presidency.]]
In all, more than 45,000 American Indians were relocated to the West during Jackson's administration. A few Cherokees escaped forced relocation, or walked back afterwards, escaping to the high [[Great Smoky Mountains|Smoky Mountains]] along the [[North Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]] border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cherokee-nc.com/index.php?page=56 |title=Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians - History |publisher=Cherokee-nc.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-06}}</ref>

During the Jacksonian era, the administration bought about 100 million acres (400,000&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of Indian land for about $68 million and 32 million acres (130,000&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of western land.  Jackson was criticized at the time for his role in these events, and the criticism has grown over the years. Remini characterizes the Indian Removal era as "one of the unhappiest chapters in American history."<ref>Remini (2001).</ref>

===Attack and assassination attempt===
[[File:JacksonAssassinationAttempt.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Lawrence (failed assassin)|Richard Lawrence]]'s attempt on Jackson's life, as depicted in an 1835 etching.]]

The first attempt to do bodily harm to a President was against Jackson. Jackson ordered the dismissal of Robert B. Randolph from the [[United States Navy|Navy]] for [[embezzlement]]. On May 6, 1833, Jackson sailed on USS ''Cygnet'' to [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of [[Mary Ball Washington]], [[George Washington]]'s mother. During a stopover near [[Alexandria, Virginia]], Randolph appeared and struck the President. He then fled the scene with several members of Jackson's party chasing him, including the well known writer [[Washington Irving]]. Jackson decided not to press charges.<ref name=Paletta/>

On January 30, 1835, what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting President of the United States occurred just outside the [[United States Capitol]]. When Jackson was leaving the Capitol out of the East Portico after the funeral of [[South Carolina]] Representative [[Warren R. Davis]], [[Richard Lawrence (failed assassin)|Richard Lawrence]], an unemployed and deranged housepainter from England, either burst from a crowd or stepped out from hiding behind a column and aimed a pistol at Jackson, which misfired. Lawrence then pulled out a second pistol, which also misfired. It has been postulated that moisture from the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring.<ref name="AmericanHeritage.com">{{cite web | title=Trying to Assassinate Andrew Jackson | author=Jon Grinspan | url=http://www.americanheritage.com/people/articles/web/20070130-richard-lawrence-andrew-jackson-assassination-warren-r-davis.shtml| accessdate=November 11, 2008}}</ref>  Lawrence was then restrained, with legend saying that Jackson attacked Lawrence with his cane, prompting his aides to restrain him. Others present, including [[Davy Crockett|David Crockett]], restrained and disarmed Lawrence.

Richard Lawrence gave the doctors several reasons for the shooting. He had recently lost his job painting houses and somehow blamed Jackson. He claimed that with the President dead, "money would be more plenty" (a reference to Jackson's struggle with the Bank of the United States) and that he "could not rise until the President fell." Finally, he informed his interrogators that he was a deposed English King<U+2014>specifically, [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], dead since 1485<U+2014>and that Jackson was merely his clerk. He was deemed insane, institutionalized, and never punished for his assassination attempt.

Afterward, due to curiosity concerning the double misfires, the pistols were tested and retested.  Each time they performed perfectly.  When these results were known, many believed that Jackson had been protected by the same Providence that had protected the young nation.  This national pride was a large part of the Jacksonian cultural myth fueling American expansion in the 1830s.

==Family and personal life==
[[File:Andrew Jackson-1844-2.jpg|thumb|[[Daguerreotype]] of Andrew Jackson at age 77 or 78 (1844 or 1845).]]

Shortly after Jackson first arrived in Nashville in 1788, he lived as a boarder with Rachel Stockley Donelson, the widow of [[John Donelson]]. Here Jackson became acquainted with their daughter, [[Rachel Jackson|Rachel Donelson Robards]]. At the time, Rachel Robards was in an unhappy marriage with Captain Lewis Robards, a man subject to irrational{{Dubious|date|date=December 2009}} fits of jealous rage. Due to Lewis Robards' temperament, the two were separated in 1790.  According to Jackson, he married Rachel after hearing that Robards had obtained a divorce. However, the divorce had never been completed, making Rachel's marriage to Jackson technically [[bigamy|bigamous]] and therefore invalid.  After the divorce was officially completed, Rachel and Jackson remarried in 1794.<ref>Remini, 17<U+2013>25</ref>  However, there is evidence that Donelson had been living with Jackson and referred to herself as Mrs. Jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made.<ref>{{cite book

</ref>  It was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially, as long as they were recognized by the community.

The controversy surrounding their marriage remained a sore point for Jackson, who deeply resented attacks on his wife's honor. Jackson fought 13 duels, many nominally over his wife's honor.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} [[Charles Dickinson (historical figure)|Charles Dickinson]], the only man Jackson ever killed in a duel, had been goaded into angering Jackson by Jackson's political opponents. In the duel, fought over a horse-racing debt and an insult to his wife on May 30, 1806, Dickinson shot Jackson in the ribs before Jackson returned the fatal shot; Jackson allowed Dickinson to shoot first, knowing him to be an excellent shot, and as his opponent reloaded, Jackson shot, even as the bullet lodged itself in his chest. The bullet that struck Jackson was so close to his heart that it could never be safely removed. Jackson had been wounded so frequently in duels that it was said he "rattled like a bag of marbles."<ref>{{cite book|title=Character : Profiles in Presidential Courage|last=Wallace|first=Chris|authorlink=Chris Wallace (journalist)|publisher=Rugged Land|location=New York, NY|year=2005|isbn=1-59071-054-1}}</ref>  At times he coughed up blood, and he experienced considerable pain from his wounds for the rest of his life.

Rachel died of a heart attack on December 22, 1828, two weeks after her husband's victory in the election and two months before Jackson taking office as President.  Jackson blamed [[John Quincy Adams]] for Rachel's death because the marital scandal was brought up in the election of 1828. He felt that this had hastened her death and never forgave Adams.

Jackson had two adopted sons, Andrew Jackson Jr., the son of Rachel's brother Severn Donelson, and Lyncoya, a Creek Indian orphan adopted by Jackson after the Creek War.  Jackson had planned to have Lyncoya educated at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]],<ref name="Tread"/> but he died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1828, at the age of sixteen.<ref>[http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=7 Rachel Donelson Robards Jackson].

The Jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children. John Samuel Donelson, [[Daniel Smith Donelson]] and [[Andrew Jackson Donelson]] were the sons of Rachel's brother Samuel Donelson, who died in 1804. Andrew Jackson Hutchings was Rachel's orphaned grand nephew. Caroline Butler, Eliza Butler, Edward Butler, and Anthony Butler were the orphaned children of Edward Butler, a family friend. They came to live with the Jacksons after the death of their father.

[[File:Andrew Jackson Tomb.jpg|thumb|The tomb of Andrew and [[Rachel Donelson Jackson]] located at their home, [[The Hermitage (Tennessee)|The Hermitage]].]]

The widower Jackson invited Rachel's niece [[Emily Donelson]] to serve as host at the White House. Emily was married to [[Andrew Jackson Donelson]], who acted as Jackson's private secretary and in 1856 would run for Vice President on the [[Know Nothing|American Party]] ticket. The relationship between the President and Emily became strained during the [[Petticoat affair]], and the two became estranged for over a year. They eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as White House host. [[Sarah Yorke Jackson]], the wife of Andrew Jackson Jr., became cohost of the White House in 1834. It was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial First Lady. Sarah took over all hosting duties after Emily died from tuberculosis in 1836.  Jackson used [[Rip Raps]] as a retreat, visiting between August 19, 1829 through August 16, 1835.<ref>Meacham, page 109; 315</ref>

Jackson remained influential in both national and state politics after retiring to [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|The Hermitage]] in 1837. Though a slave-holder, Jackson was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states, and declined to give any support to talk of secession.

Jackson was a lean figure standing at 6 feet, 1&nbsp;inch (1.85 m) tall, and weighing between 130 and 140 pounds (64&nbsp;kg) on average. Jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair, which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age 61. He had penetrating deep blue eyes. Jackson was one of the more sickly presidents, suffering from chronic headaches, abdominal pains, and a hacking cough, caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed, that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake. After retiring to Nashville, he enjoyed eight years of retirement and died at [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|The Hermitage]] on June 8, 1845, at the age of 78, of chronic tuberculosis, [[dropsy]], and [[heart failure]].

In his will, Jackson left his entire estate to his adopted son, Andrew Jackson Jr., except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various other friends and family members. About a year after retiring the presidency,<ref>{{cite book |title=Andrew Jackson |first=Sean |last= Wilentz |publisher=Macmillan |year= 2005 |page=160}}</ref> Jackson became a member of the [[Downtown Presbyterian Church, Nashville|First Presbyterian Church]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].
