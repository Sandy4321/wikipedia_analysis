In ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', the [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]], the '''Abyss''' or more fully, the '''Infinite Layers of the Abyss''', is a [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)#Chaotic Evil|chaotic evil]]-aligned [[Plane (Dungeons & Dragons)|plane]] of existence. It exists as one of a number of [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]]-based [[Outer Plane]]s that form part of the standard ''Dungeons & Dragons'' (''D&D'') cosmology, used in the ''[[Planescape]]'' and ''[[Greyhawk]]'' [[campaign setting]]s. It also exists as one of a number of faith-based outer planes that form part of the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' cosmology. While the published ''3rd-Edition'' source books indicate that the Abyss of the standard ''D&D'' cosmology is not the same plane as the Abyss of the ''Forgotten Realms'' cosmology, they are for all intents and purposes identical.

==Description==

The description of the Abyss varies some between different editions, campaign settings and even individual accessories. This can be viewed as canonical status of the plane of the Abyss changing, or as an in-character explanation that the conflicting information is the result of misinformation spread by the demons themselves, and of misunderstandings by those who study them.

One description of the Abyss presents it as a region of intense, extreme, and unforgiving climates, with layers consisting of overwhelmingly fierce [[desert]] [[dust storm|sandstorm]]s, explosively unstable volcanic activity, boiling [[lava]], and molten rock, blinding, sub-zero arctic [[glacier]]s, bottomless oceans filled with enormous [[leviathan]]s, nauseatingly putrid environments saturated with disease-causing [[fungi]], and the endless, existential void of infinite space.

==Inhabitants==
The Abyss is the home of one of the principal combatants in the blood war, the [[Tanar'ri]], a class of [[Demon (Dungeons & Dragons)|demon]] that rule the plane. Various other [[chaotic evil]] creatures and [[deities]] inhabit the plane, including bebiliths, bodaks, [[Undead (Dungeons & Dragons)|undead]] and even some renegade devils. 

The [[Petitioner (Dungeons & Dragons)|petitioners]] of the Abyss are called ''manes''. They have pale white skin, sharp teeth and claws, and maggots are reported to crawl through their flesh. Manes that survive for many years may be promoted to lesser forms of demon.

The [[Demon lord (Dungeons & Dragons)|demon lords]] inhabit the Abyss, including [[Demogorgon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Demogorgon]], [[Graz'zt]], and [[Pazuzu (Dungeons & Dragons)|Pazuzu]]. Many evil deities make their home here including [[Lolth]], the [[Great Mother (Dungeons & Dragons)|Great Mother]] and [[Diirinka]], deity of the [[Derro (Dungeons & Dragons)|Derro]].

==Structure==
Like other outer planes, the Abyss is spatially infinite and supposedly consists of an infinite number of layers, or sub-planes. 

In the standard ''D&D'' cosmology, the first layer shares its borders with the neighboring planes of the [[Pandemonium (plane)|Windswept Depths of Pandemonium]] and the [[Carceri (plane)|Tarterian Depths of Carceri]]; travel is possible between the Abyss and these planes at certain locations. ''[[The River Styx]]'' flows through the Abyss to many other [[lower planes]], and as such can be used to gain access to those planes.{{ref|manual_of_the_planes_2001}}

In the ''Forgotten Realms'' cosmology the Abyss links via the [[Astral Plane]], to [[Toril]], the [[Prime Material Plane|Material Plane]]. A number of [[portal (fiction)|portal]]s directly connect it with the [[Barrens of Doom and Despair]], [[Clangor]], and on occasion, with, [[Deep Caverns]] and [[The Fated Depths]]. The ''River of Blood'' originates in the Abyss and flows through the lower planes, allowing travellers access to those planes by navigating the river.{{ref|players_guide_to_faerun}}

==Layers==
The Abyss is said to consist of an infinite amount of layers, though the total number of layers is also quoted as [[666]] (with an in-game explanation of the number having general numerological import). Layers are numbered based upon order of discovery by various personalities in the background details of the game, sometimes considered documented by the Fraternity of Order faction of the [[Planescape]] setting. Discrepancies in layer numbers between supplements and sources can be explained as catalogues that have been compiled by different sources.

It is impossible to know with any certainty whether layers are actually arranged in this precise order, in contrast to the known ordering of layers within all the other planes of the D&D cosmology. A useful metaphor is a deck of playing cards shuffled and then tossed down so they are piled together loosely, randomly, and sometimes not at all.

A list of layers named so far in D&D supplements includes:

*1 - '''Pazunia'''{{ref|Throne-of_Bloodstone_p30-33}} (also known as ''The Plane of Infinite Portals'' or ''The Palace of 1001 Closets'') has been described as an infinite plane with only three types of distinct features:
**The river [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]] flowing through it (as it does through the top layers of other evil planes).
**Large [[sinkholes]] which connect to other layers of the Abyss, possibly drilled intentionally by ancient demons.
**Iron [[Fortification|Fortresses]] which guard the physical bodies of Demon Princes when they leave the Abyss to [[astral travel]].
