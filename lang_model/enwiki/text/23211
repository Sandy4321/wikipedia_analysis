== Political and Civic Work ==
Menin became active in New York City [[politics]] when she founded and became president of Wall Street Rising, a [[non-profit organization]] created in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]] to restore "vibrancy and vitality" in Lower Manhattan.

In 2002, Mayor [[Michael R. Bloomberg]] appointed Menin as a Redistricting Commissioner to help in redrawing the new boundaries of the [[New York City Council|NYC City Council]].

In 2003, she was appointed to serve on the jury for the [[World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition]].

On January 16, 2010, She wrote an op-ed for the New York Times arguing that the trial of 9-11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed should be moved out of Lower Manhattan.<ref>{{cite news|last=Menin |first=Julie |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/opinion/17menin.html/ |title=Trial by Ferry|publisher=New York Times |date=January 16, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2010}}</ref>

On May 25, 2010, the [[Lower Manhattan]] Community Board 1, which she chaired, voted 29-to-1, with 10 abstentions in a non-binding advisory vote backed part of the plans for [[Cordoba House]] to be built on a site near Ground Zero.  The endorsement related only to "the important community facilities [the project] will provide," and the resolution indicated that the board "takes no position regarding the religious aspects or any religious facilities associated with either the Cordoba Initiative or the Cordoba House Project."  Menin supported deletion of references to the building as a mosque and interfaith center that were in an earlier draft of the resolution, saying:  "I personally was uncomfortable with the language that talked about the religious institution. I believe it's not the purview of a city agency to be weighing in on the siting of any religious institution, be it a mosque, synagogue, or church."  The vote did not have any binding effect.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/26/2010-05-26_clash_over_mosque_heated_debate_on_a_house_of_worship_near_ground_zero.html |title=Supporters, opponents debate merits of controversial plan to build mosque near Ground Zero |first=Rob |last=Sgobbo |first2=Samuel |last2=Goldsmith |newspaper=Daily News |location=New York |date=May 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref><ref name="boston1">{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2010/05/25/nyc_community_board_oks_ground_zero_mosque_plans/ |title=NYC community board OKs ground zero mosque plans |newspaper=The Boston Globe |date= May 25, 2010|accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref><ref name="montrealgazette1">{{cite web|author=AFP  |url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/board+approves+Ground+Zero+mosque/3075458/story.html |title=NYC board approves Ground Zero mosque |publisher=Montreal Gazette|date=May 27, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Plan For Mosque Next to Ground Zero in NYC Moves Forward |first=Mark |last=Memmott |newspaper=[[NPR]] |date=May 6, 2010 |url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/05/mosque_ground_zero_world_trade.html |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}</ref><ref name="tribecatrib1">{{cite news|url=http://www.tribecatrib.com/news/2010/may/617_cb1-backs-imams-community-center-but-stays-silent-on-mosque-near-wtc.html |title=CB1 Backs Imam's Community Center, Silent on Mosque Near WTC |first=Matt |last=Dunning |newspaper=The Tribeca Trib |date=May 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2010}}</ref>

On August 30, 2010, she wrote an op-ed for the New York Daily News suggesting that an interfaith, nondenominational center be built on two floors of the project. This would be modeled after the Pentagon Interfaith Chapel in order to bridge the divide.<ref>{{cite web|last=Menin |first=Julie |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/08/30/2010-08-30_better_mosque_compromise_chair_of_community_board_wants_interfaith_center_inside.html/ |title=Better mosque compromise: Chair of community board wants interfaith center inside Park51 project |publisher=NY Daily News |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=December 21, 2010}}</ref> 

She has been a frequent critic of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (on whose board she sits) and exposed that the agency was sitting on over $200 million.<ref>{{cite web|last=Menin |first=Julie |url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20100613/SUB/306139983/ |title=Opinion: Taxpayer dollars are not at work |publisher=Crain's New York Business |date=June 13, 2010 |accessdate=December 21, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Menin |first=Julie |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/04/14/2010-04-14_150m_in_wtc_found_money_use_it_now_to_build_a_performing_arts_center_on_the_deut.html |title=$150M in WTC found money: Use it now to build a performing arts center on the Deutsche Bank site|publisher=New York Daily News |date=April 14, 2010 |accessdate=December 21, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kaysen |first=Ronda |url=http://www.downtownexpress.com/de_129/lmdcpummeledatpublic.html |title=L.M.D.C. pummeled at public meeting|publisher=Downtown Express |date=October 8, 2005 |accessdate=December 21, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Karni |first=Annie |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/gov_to_slash_lmdc_mr87awTi8m4JE2bMS2HbnM |title=Gov to slash LMDC |publisher=New York Post |date=June 20, 2010 |accessdate=December 21, 2010}}</ref>   
She battled Con Edison in 2010, who tried to lay claim to the $200 million of LMDC funding when Con Ed threatened to raise all New Yorkers rates by $50 if she did not back down.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shapiro |first=Julie |url=http://www.dnainfo.com/20100622/manhattan/con-edison-community-board-1-wrangle-over-911-recovery-money |title=Con Edison and Community Board 1 Wrangle Over 9/11 Recovery Money|publisher=DNA Info |date=June 22, 2010 |accessdate=December 21, 2010}}</ref> Menin then wrote the Public Service Commission demanding that they investigate Con Ed for illegally threatening to raise rates.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/opinion/12thu4.html |title=Unneeded Bureaucracy at Ground Zero |publisher=New York Times |date=August 11, 2010 |accessdate=December 21, 2010}}</ref> She prevailed and the $200 million was allocated to Lower Manhattan as she had advocated.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reynolds |first=Aline |url=http://www.downtownexpress.com/de_386/lmdc.html |title=L.M.D.C. set to release $200 million in grants|publisher=Downtown Express |date=September 15, 2010 |accessdate=December 21, 2010}}</ref>

On October 26 2011, Menin led Community Board 1 to a 33-3 vote in favor of Occupy Wall Street's First Amendment right to protest, and opposed the use of force by the city of New York, and at the same time urged the city to address some of the quality of life issues for restaurants and small businesses adjacent to the site, saying "the two were not mutually exclusive." This approach was praised in a New York Times editorial as a "good approach."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/opinion/a-good-approach-on-wall-street.html?_r=3 |title=A Good Approach on Wall Street |publisher=New York Times |date=October 24, 2011 |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-10-23/news/30329927_1_zero-tolerance-protest-sanitation |title=Making peace with Occupy Wall Street: Community board president says violence is no answer |publisher=New York Daily News |date=October 23, 2011 |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref>
