{{Campaignbox Winter Line}}

The '''Moro River Campaign''' was a campaign fought by the [[British Eighth Army]] across the Moro River in eastern [[Italy]] in December 1943 against divisions of the [[German Tenth Army]]'s [[LXXVI Panzer Corps]]. The campaign was part of the British Eighth Army's drive to reach and breach the eastern part of the German [[Winter Line]] defensive system, a series of prepared defensive lines where the Germans skilfully employed the Italian terrain which naturally favoured defense. The campaign lasted throughout December, 1943, and was characterized by nearly-continual combat operations by both sides, attempting to keep one another pinned down.  The offensive culminated in the intense fighting of Canadian infantry and armour against elements of the [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|German 1st Parachute Division]] at the [[Battle of Ortona]], dubbed "Little Stalingrad" by both sides.

==Background==
In late 1943 Allied armies were fighting their way northward in Italy against determined opposition from German forces which had prepared a succession of defensive lines. East of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennine Mountain spine]] was the [[British Eighth Army]] under General [[Bernard Montgomery]]. Delayed by bad weather, he had launched in late November an attack against the the defensive positions on the high ground north of the [[Sangro River]]. The main attack had been carried out by [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]], comprising [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|78th Infantry Division]] and [[8th Infantry Division (India)|Indian 8th Infantry Division]] with supporting and diversionary attacks further inland by [[2nd New Zealand Division]] and [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]]. After several days of hard fighting the Germans withdrew to the defenses they had prepared on the high ground to the north of the Moro river.<ref>Hoyt (2007), pp. 112-114</ref>

The Moro River runs from the central mountain spine of Italy hitting the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast south of [[Ortona]].  The defenses on the Moro were a centerpiece of the [[Winter Line]], which to the east of the Apennines guarded the way to [[Pescara]] from where Route 5 traversed the country to Rome on the west coast. Montgomery hoped to punch through the Winter Line, capture Ortona and Pescara and advance to Rome.  78th Division, which had been spearheading V Corps since the [[Volturno Line]] actions and had sustained over 7,000 casualties in less than six months,<ref name="Tiger23">Anon (1946), p. 23</ref> was relieved by the fresh 1st Canadian Infantry Division ready to renew the offensive on [[5 December]][[1943]].<ref>Hoyt (2007), p. 115</ref>

Montgomery's plan was for the Canadian Division to attack across the Moro to take first Ortona and then Pescara. Inland, in the jagged hills above the headwaters of the Moro, the relatively fresh [[2nd New Zealand Division]] would attack towards Orsogna while between these two 8th Indian Infantry Division would hold the center of the front in a relatively static role.<ref name="Tiger23"/>

==Canadians cross the Moro==
Beginning on [[December 6]][[1943]], Canadian forces began a series of large-scale assaults on major crossing-points along the Moro River, with the objective of securing a large bridgehead along the defensive line.<ref name="Z158">Zuehlke (2001), p. 158</ref>  Three primary points of attack were chosen:  Villa Rogatti, along the western edge of the Canadian sector;<ref name="Z158"/> San Leonardo, 5km south of [[Ortona]]; & San Donato, a small town near the Italian coast.  Five primary infantry battalions were selected to assault these positions, with the hope of crossing the Moro River.  The offensives were scheduled to start on the morning of [[December 6]].

===Villa Rogatti===
The task of taking Villa Rogatti, the westernmost crossing point, was given to the [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].  Having conducted significant reconnaissance on their objective during the night of [[December 5]][[1943]],<ref name="Z76">Zuehlke (1999), p. 76</ref>  As a result, a thorough attack plan had been devised by the battalion's commander, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Cameron Bethel Ware]], detailing the objectives of all four rifle-companies.<ref name="Z76"/>  Once the objectives had been secured by the early morning of [[December 6]], Anglo-Canadian reinforcements were to be moved into Villa Rogatti, with the intention of repulsing potentially strong German counterattacks.<ref>Zuehlke (1999), p. 77</ref>

At midnight on the night of December 5 &mdash; 6, two companies of the PPCLI crossed the Moro River, moving towards Villa Rogatti.<ref>Zuehlke (1999), p. 78</ref>  Within an hour, vicious fighting had erupted throughout Villa Rogatti, as the two companies of Canadian infantry struggled to break the German defensive lines.<ref name="Z79">Zuehlke (1999), p. 79</ref>  As B-Company broke through the German defenses, A-Company moved through the northeastern areas of the town, continuing to eliminate German resistance.<ref name="Z79"/>

Although two Infantry Companies had occupied Villa Rogatti, German [[Panzergrenadier]] forces still had substantial defenses outside of the town.  However, C-Company continued to steadily advance along the eastern side of the town, encountering significant German resistance throughout.<ref>Zuehlke (1999), p. 80</ref>.  After approximately an hour of fighting by C-Company & D-Company, Villa Rogatti had been occupied by Canadian forces shortly before dawn.<ref name="Zuehlke8485">Zuehlke (1999), pp. 84-85</ref>

By mid-morning, German counterattacks on PPCLI positions in the town had begun, involving tanks, field guns, & substantial infantry forces.<ref name="Zuehlke8485"/>  Throughout the afternoon, two infantry companies of the PPCLI fought off several attacks by German forces, eventually managing to push them back to the vineyards on the northern edge of the town.<ref>Zuehlke (1999), p. 88</ref>  Shortly after, Panzergrenadier forces retreated from the town entirely, while the PPCLI had taken 68 casualties, while German casualties were estimated at 120.<ref name="Z91">Zuehlke (1999), p. 91</ref>  However, German forces now surrounded their positions at Villa Rogatti, rendering further exploitation of the bridgehead difficult.  Colonel Ware was advised to be ready to withdraw across the Moro River, should German forces counterattack.<ref name="Z91"/>  In order to allow the Canadian Division a greater concentration of force, on the night of December 7/8, Indian 21st Infantry Brigade from [[Indian 8th Infantry Division]] took over the left hand end of the Canadian front<ref name="Tiger24">Anon (1946), p. 24</ref> in Villa Rogatti.<ref>Bercuson, p. 173</ref> It was not intended for the Indian Brigade to enter the battle but to demonstrate and employ deception to draw reserves from the Canadian and New Zealand fronts.<ref name="Tiger23"/>  As a result of the withdrawal, Canadian efforts would focus on achieving a bridgehead at San Leonardo.

===San Leonardo===
The Canadian attack on San Leonardo, primarily initiated by the [[Seaforth Highlanders]], had begun late on [[December 5]][[1943]], with 'A' Company establishing a small bridgehead across the Moro, despite taking heavy casualties.  In the early morning of December 6, 'A' Company was withdrawn, & two additional Seaforth Companies resumed the offensive.  As the [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] secured & held their bridgehead over the Moro River, the [[Seaforth Highlanders]] were struggling to enter San Leonardo throughout the morning.<ref name="Zuehlke92">Zuehlke (1999), p. 92</ref>  By 0715, B Company had achieved its objective on the left flank of the town, but were taking significant German machine-gun fire.  At the same time, small arms fire prevented C Company from moving up the road from the Moro to San Leonardo, while 'D' Company remained on the southern banks of the Moro throughout the early-morning.<ref name="Zuehlke92"/>  Had a significant crossing point been available, British & Canadian tank forces could have quickly reinforced the [[Seaforth Highlanders]]' positions in San Leonardo.  However, no such crossing point was located.<ref name="Zuehlke93">Zuehlke (1999), p. 93</ref>  By noon, however, Colonel Doug Forin had devised an attack plan for taking the remainder of San Leonardo. B Company would move southeast, diverting pressure from C Company.  Simultaneously, A Company & D Company would cross the Moro, linking up with C Company, at which point a solid drive for San Leonardo would be initiated.<ref name="Zuehlke94">Zuehlke (1999), p. 94</ref>

By 1340hrs, [[1st Canadian Infantry Brigade]] had initiated an artillery barrage against German positions near San Leonardo, while the [[Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment]] sent two companies to the aid of the [[Seaforth Highlanders]], while Seaforth B Company hit multiple German positions west of San Leonardo, inflicting 129 casualties on German forces in the area.<ref name="Zuehlke94"/>  However, the attack on San Leonardo by three Seaforth Companies stalled rapidly, as German tanks moved into the area.<ref name="Zuehlke96">Zuehlke (1999), p. 96</ref>  As a result, Forin was ordered to prepare for a withdrawal from the San Leonardo Bridgehead.

===San Donato===
As attempts were made to cross the Moro at San Leonardo & Villa Rogatti, the [[The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment]] attacked the Moro River defenses at the small coastal hamlet of San Donato, with the attack beginning at 1340 on [[December 6]].<ref name="Zuehlke9899">Zuehlke (1999), pp. 98-99</ref><ref>Zuehlke (2001), p. 159</ref>  Initially, a single rifle company was thrown against German defenses on the Moro River, yet made little territorial gain.  Lieutenant Colonel Kennedy ordered a withdrawal by both companies at 1540.<ref name="Zuehlke9899"/> Attempts to exploit the position throughout the day, including assaults by tanks & artillery, failed to take San Donato.  By nightfall, two companies had a tenuous hold on the northern bank of the Moro River.<ref name="Zuehlke9899"/>

===Taking the Moro===
[[Image:Moro-captured.jpg|thumb|right|soldiers of the [[The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada|Seaforth Highlanders]] searching German prisoners near the Moro River. [[December 8]][[1943]]]]
On [[December 8]][[1943]], [[Christopher Vokes|Major General Vokes]] devised a new plan for taking the Moro River.  While the [[48th Highlanders of Canada]] & the [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] resumed the assault on San Leonardo from the southwest side of the town, the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] would break out of the bridgehead created by the [[Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment]], then move southwest towards San Leonardo, linking up with the 48th & PPCLI to take the Moro River.<ref name="Bercuson174">Bercuson, p. 174</ref>  The operation was schedules to start on the afternoon of December 8.

The attack on the Moro River began with a massive artillery barrage, which pounded German positions continuously for two hours.<ref name="Zuehlke122123">Zuehlke (1999), pp. 122-123</ref>  At 1600, the [[Saskatoon Light Infantry]] support battalion joined in, hitting German positions with severe bursts of machine gun fire.<ref name="Zuehlke122123"/>  The moment the heavy bombardment lifted, the 48th Highlanders & the RCR both initiated their attacks on the Moro River.  D Company of the 48th Highlanders was able to quickly cross the Moro, taking minimal casualties.  However, B Company was subjected to heavy fire from German Mortar & 88mm field gun positions.<ref name="Zuehlke127128">Zuehlke (1999), pp. 127-128</ref>  Eventually, however, both companies managed to establish strong positions on the western ridge overlooking San Leonardo.<ref name="Zuehlke127128"/> During the night of December 8/9, units of the [[Royal Canadian Engineers]] constructed a bridge for use in crossing the Moro, to allow armour & equipment to move into San Leonardo the following day.<ref name="Bercuson174"/>


As the 48th Highlanders secured their positions west of San Leonardo, the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] was involved in vicious fighting southwest of San Donato.  Two companies had advanced against strong & well prepared German defenses of the 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment.<ref name="Zuehlke130">Zuehlke (1999), p. 130</ref>  A Company was quickly tied down by German mortar fire, while B Company flanked German positions to the north of San Donato.  By nightfall, all four companies held tenuous positions in the thick of German defenses.  Throughout the night of December 8/9, the RCR was subjected to vicious counterattacks by the 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment, while Canadian Artillery continuously shelled German positions around the RCR.<ref name="Bercuson174"/>

By morning of [[9 December]], the RCE had managed to construct a bridge across the Moro River, enabling the [[King's Own Calgary Regiment|Calgary Tanks]] to transport two companies of Seaforth Highlanders across the river & into San Leonardo.<ref>Zuehlke (1999), p. 137</ref>  By mid morning, San Leonardo had been cleared of German defenders, although strong positions still existed outside of the town.  Within an hour, the Royal Canadian Regiment had broken through German positions near Sterlen Castle, & two companies had linked up with the 48th Highlanders & Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry within San Leonardo, finally establishing firm Canadian positions across the Moro River.<ref name="Bercuson174"/>  Near the end of [[December 9]][[1943]], German forces of the [[90th Light Infantry Division (Germany)|90th Panzergrenadier Division]] fell back to their second defensive line; a formidable obstacle known as "The Gully".<ref>Zuehlke (2001), p. 159</ref>

==New Zealand Division attacks Orsogna==
Meanwhile, after a period of patrolling and probing to identify the location of the German defenses of [[23rd Infantry Division (Germany)|26th Panzer Division]] and the right flank of the 90th Panzer Grenadier Division, the New Zealand Division, with [[2nd Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|British 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade]] under command and anchoring their left flank,<ref>Phillips (1957), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Ita-c5-1.html#n105 p. 105]</ref> launched ''Operation Torso'', a two brigade attack against Orsogna at 1430 on [[7 December]] accompanied by heavy concentrations of artillery and air support.<ref>Phillips (1957), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Ita-c5-2.html#n109 p. 109]</ref> Surprise was achieved as [[Traugott Herr]], the commander of [[LXXVI Panzer Corps (Germany)|LXXVI Panzer Corps]], had been persuaded that the New Zealanders would not be in a position to launch a major attack until [[8 December]].<ref>Phillips (1957), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Ita-c5-2.html#n110 p. 110]</ref>

Initially the New Zealand attack went well<ref>Phillips (1957), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Ita-c5-2.html#n111 p. 111]</ref> but the German defenders regained their composure and the attack lost momentum against skilfully designed defensive positions. By 2100 NZ 24th Infantry Battalion had fought its way in painfully slow house to house fighting to the centre of the town but were pinned down with no prospect of further progress without armoured support.<ref>Phillips (1957), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Ita-c5-2.html#n114 p. 114]</ref> However, a combination of cleverly located minefields and German armour well dug in in commanding positions made the task of the Allied tanks impossible.<ref>Phillips (1957), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Ita-c5-2.html#n116 p. 116]</ref>  In the early hours of [[8 December]] the New Zealand commander [[Bernard Freyberg]] ordered a withdrawal from the town with a view to renewing the attack after further softening up from artillery and bombers.<ref>Phillips (1957), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Ita-c5-2.html#n115 p. 115]</ref>

==8th Indian Infantry Division joins the attack==
With both the Canadian and New Zealand Divisions finding progress difficult, it was decided to bring Indian 21st Infantry Brigade into the attack with orders to seize Caldari. With no river crossing available, the Indian engineers rushed to build a bridge which was completed on [[9 December]] and allowed infantry and supporting armour to cross to expand the bridgehead on the far bank. The bridge was named the "Impossible Bridge" because the local geography required for it to be built backwards from the enemy bank of the river.<ref name="Tiger24">Anon (1946), p. 24</ref>

To the left of the Canadian division Indian 21st Brigade had by [[13 December]] established a solid bridgehead around the "Impossible Bridge". That night a second 8th Indian Division brigade, 17th Indian Infantry Brigade, passed through and attacked towards Caldari. 1st battalion [[Royal Fusiliers]] stormed the village in a wild night's fighting while 1st battalion [[5th Gurkha Rifles]] seized Point 198 nearby, holding it against determined counterattacks including from tanks on the afternoon of the of [[14 December]]. That evening 1st battalion [[12th Frontier Force Regiment]] attacked on the left of the Gurkhas and established positions on the lateral road between Ortona and Orsogna running parallel to the Moro some {{convert|1000|yd|m}} north of the "Impossible Bridge". On the evening of [[15 December]] 1st/5th battalion [[Essex Regiment]] from the Indian Division's 19th Indian Infantry Brigade, which had been held in reserve, was committed on the left flank of the Frontier Force Regiment to overrun a number of German positions. By the end of [[16 December]], after further attacks by 3rd battalion [[15th Punjab Regiment]] from 21st Brigade which secured further positions on the lateral road, the Indian Division was firmly embedded in the heart of the main German defenses.<ref>Anon (1946), p. 26</ref>

==The Gully==
===Initial Attacks===
Following the loss of San Leonardo and the Moro River, the 90th Panzergrenadier Division retreated to a primary defensive line {{Convert|8|km|mi}} north of San Leonardo.  The line centred around a natural ravine known as "The Gully", with an average depth of 200 feet.<ref name="Zuehlke166">Zuehlke (1999), p. 166</ref>  General Vokes' initial plan to take the position (as well as achieve a foothold on the roads towards Ortona) consisted of a frontal assault by the [[2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade]], which would seize Vino Ridge, capture The Gully, & gain positions on the Ortona to Orsogna road.<ref name="Berton437">Berton, p. 437</ref>  However, German defenses were adequately prepared, including gun&ndash;pits, bunkers, shelters, and a significant number of German troops.<ref name="Berton437"/>

On [[December 10]][[1943]], three Canadian regiments made their first attempt to cross The Gully.  Although they succeeded in capturing Vino Ridge, directly south of The Gully, attempts to neutralize German positions in The Gully were unsuccessful.<ref>Zuehlke (1999), p. 172</ref><ref name="Bercuson174"/>  On [[December 11]], the three battalions made another attempt, with the [[Loyal Edmonton Regiment]] suffering heavy casualties in their attempts to take German positions in The Gully.<ref>Zuehlke (2001), p. 159</ref>  Although a badly&ndash;mauled A Company was able to gain a foothold on the reverse slope of The Gully, forming German counterattack units forced the company's remaining 45 men to withdraw.<ref>Zuehlke (1999), p. 177</ref>

On [[December 12]][[1943]], General Vokes sent the three battalions of the Third Canadian Infantry Brigade against The Gully's defenses.<ref name="Berton438">Berton, p. 438</ref>  The assault started poorly, when Canadian Artillery plans were captured by soldiers of the 90th Panzergrenadier Division.<ref>Zuehlke (1999), p. 186</ref>  When [[The West Nova Scotia Regiment]] attacked The Gully, they were subject to vicious [[Panzergrenadier]] counterattacks at approximately 1030.  By 1400, the regiment had called off their attacks on The Gully &mdash; primarily as a result of the chaos caused by the German counterattack &mdash; and had taken heavy casualties.  To the west, the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry fared little better, with C Company taking heavy casualties in their assault on The Gully.<ref name="Berton438"/>  Attempts were again made on [[December 13]], by two battalions of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigade, and again the attacks were driven back by tenacious German resistance.<ref>Zuehlke (1999), p. 191</ref>

During the evening of December 13, the heavily depleted 90th Panzergrenadier Division began a withdrawal from The Gully, with units of the [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|1st Parachute Division]] holding German positions on the evening of December 13.<ref>Berton, pp. 438-439</ref>

===Casa Berardi===
By [[December 14]], Vokes had devised a new assault plan for taking The Gully.  A small force from the [[Royal 22e Regiment]] would move to [[Casa Berardi]], a small set of farmhouses west of The Gully, before outflanking German positions with infantry & armoured forces, thereby forcing the 1st Parachute Division to withdraw.<ref name="Bercuson174"/>  The attack was to begin at dawn, with two companies of the Royal 22e Regiment attacking Casa Berardi with artillery support.<ref>Zuehlke (1999), p. 205</ref>  By 07:50, both companies had control of the lateral highway leading to Casa Berardi.  C Company, under Captain [[Paul Triquet]], pushed on towards Casa Berardi with support from [[The Ontario Regiment]], while D Company found itself involved in firefights southwest of Casa Berardi.<ref>Zuehlke (1999), p. 208</ref>  At 08:30, C Company began their assault towards the manor house in Casa Berardi, some {{convert|2000|yd|m}} away.  Strong German defenses caused heavy casualties to the attackers; only 21&nbsp;men and 5&nbsp;tanks made it to within {{convert|200|yd|m}} of the objective.  Despite the arrival of several [[Panzer IV]]s, Triquet's remaining forces captured the manor house at 14:30.  However, only 14 men of C Company remained in fighting condition.<ref>Zuehlke (1999), p. 210</ref>  For his efforts to capture Casa Berardi, Captain Paul Triquet was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]].<ref>Bercuson, p. 175</ref>
