'''William Sean Bennett''' (born November 9, 1975) is a former professional [[Gridiron football|American and Canadian football]] [[running back]]. He was drafted by the [[New York Giants]] in the fourth round of the [[1999 NFL Draft]]. He played [[college football]] for the [[University of Evansville|Evansville Purple Aces]], [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois Fighting Illini]] and [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern Wildcats]].

Bennett began his collegiate career as a baseball and football player at the [[University of Illinois]], but transferred to the University of Evansville after one year. At Evansville he was an [[All-American]] two&ndash;times but had to transfer due to the school dropping [[American football|football]] as a sport. Bennett then attended [[Northwestern University]] where he was a [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] and was mainly a blocker but did get a few [[Carry (American football)|rushing attempts]]. 

Since he was a senior after his single season at Northwestern, he elected to enter the [[1999 NFL Draft]] and surprised many by being selected by the [[New York Giants]] in the fourth round. He played four seasons in New York but ended up injured each season and was released after 2002. He then joined the [[New York Jets]] but was released before the [[2003 NFL season|season]] began. After his failed stints in New York he played for the [[Canadian Football League|Canadian Football League's]] [[Ottawa Renegades]] and [[Toronto Argonauts]]; and the [[Evansville BlueCats]] of the [[Indoor Football League]].
