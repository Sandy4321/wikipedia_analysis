The '''1899 Michigan Wolverines football team''' represented the [[University of Michigan]] in the [[college football]] season of 1899.  The team was coached by former Michigan halfback [[Gustave Ferbert]]. The Wolverines opened the season with six consecutive shutouts, outscoring opponents in those six contests by a combined score of 109 to 0.  However, Michigan finished the season by going 2&ndash;2 in their final four games, losing a close game to the [[Penn Quakers football|University of Pennsylvania Quakers]] (11&ndash;10) and another to the [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin Badgers]] (17&ndash;5).  After the 1899 season, Ferbert resigned as Michigan's head coach to travel to [[Alaska]] to participate in the [[Klondike Gold Rush]].  He returned from Alaska several years later as a millionaire.<ref name=Obit>{{cite news|title=Ex-Michigan Coach Stricken by Death|publisher=The Nevada State Journal|date=1943-01-16}}</ref><ref name=Gold>{{cite news|title=Half-Back for Alaska: 'Dutch' Ferbert of Michigan Going to Hunt for Gold|publisher=Daily Iowa Capital|date=1900-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Finds Wealth in Klondike: Famous Athlete Coming Back Home After Making a Rich Strike in the North"|publisher=Coshcocton Daily Tribune (Ohio)|date=1909-10-23}}</ref><ref name=Touchdown>{{cite news|title=His Touchdown in the Arctic: How Former Football Star Made Good In Venture in the Frozen North, His Bulldog Courage|publisher=The Billings Daily Gazette|date=1909-11-09}}</ref>

==Season summary==
===Early games===
[[File:John McLean (Michigan).jpg|thumb|175px|right|All-American halfback [[John McLean (athlete)|John McLean]] also won a silver medal as a hurdler in the [[1900 Summer Olympics]].]]
Michigan opened the season with three non-conference home games in which they outscored the opponents by a combined score of 54 to 0.  The games were played against [[Hillsdale College]] (11&ndash;0), [[Albion College]] (26&ndash;0) and [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve]] (17&ndash;0).<ref name=T99>{{cite news|title=1899 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1899fbt.htm}}</ref>

===Michigan 12, Notre Dame 0===
Michigan faced [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] at [[Regents Field]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] on October 18, 1899.  Michigan won the game by a score of 12 to 0.  A newspaper account reported that Michigan's defense was generally good, and the team's overall performance against Notre Dame was "much superior" to that displayed in the prior week's game against Western Reserve.<ref>{{cite news|title=Michigan Defeats Notre Dame|newspaper=Nebraska State Journal|date=1899-10-19}}</ref>

===Michigan 5, Illinois 0===
Michigan traveled to [[Champaign, Illinois]] for a late October game against the [[University of Illinois]].  The first half ended in a scoreless tie, and Michigan scored the game's only points on a touchdown in the second half.  On the scoring drive, McLean gained 20 yards carrying the ball to the Illinois 12-yard line.  Everett Sweeney ran for six yards, and Charles McDonald then took the ball over the goal line for the score.<ref>{{cite news|title=Game at Champaign|newspaper=The Daily Review (Decatur, IL)|date=1899-10-29}}</ref>  Other newspaper accounts noted that Michigan's weight won the game, which was hard fought, from start to finish,"<ref>{{cite news|title=Michigan 5; Illinois 0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1899-10-29}}</ref> and the game was "the most hotly contested one ever played on the Illinois field."<ref>{{cite news|title=Michigan Wins From Illinois|newspaper=Davenport Daily Leader|date=1899-10-29}}</ref>

===Michigan 38, Virginia 0===
Michigan next faced the University of Virginia in a game played at [[Bennett Park (Detroit)| Bennett Park]] in Detroit.  The Wolverines won the game by a score of 38 to 0.  A newspaper account at the time reported that the game was a mismatch: "Virginia's light line was no match for the heavyweights from Ann Arbor, and in the second went all to pieces, the Michigan men gaining almost at will."<ref>{{cite news|title=Michigan Defeats Virginia|newspaper=Nebraska State Journal|date=1899-11-05}}</ref>

===Penn 11, Michigan 10===

[[File:Allen Steckle.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Tackle and 1899 team captain [[Allen Steckle]] later became a collegiate coach.]]
Michigan traveled to Philadelphia to play the University of Pennsylvania Quakers on November 11, 1899.  At the time, Penn was one of the three top football teams in the country.  Michigan scored first on a 22-yard touchdown run by [[John McLean (athlete)|John McLean]] around Penn's left end.  [[Neil Snow]] missed the kick for the goal after touchdown, and Michigan led 5 to 0 at halftime.  Penn's All-American [[Truxton Hare]] scored a touchdown in the second half (also missing its goal after touchdown attempt) to tie the score at 5 to 5.  Michigan re-took the lead when McLean and [[Allen Steckle]] carried the ball to Pennsylvania's ten-yard line, and Michigan tackle, Charles McDonald, then carried the ball over the goal line for Michigan's second touchdown.  Michigan's [[Everett Sweeley]] missed the goal after touchdown, and Michigan led 10 to 5.  With less than seven minutes left in the game, Hare scored his second touchdown of the game, and [[Pete Overfield]] kicked the goal after touchdown to give the Quakers the win with a final score of 11 to 10.<ref name=NYT/>

Although Michigan lost by a final score of 12 to 11 on Penn's Franklin Field, the Wolverines gained national respect with a good showing against the Quakers.  ''The New York Times'' reported on the results of the game as follows:<blockquote>"The game was a royal battle from start to finish, and was marked by both brilliant and poor playing by both teams. Pennsylvania earned her victory because she had to play harder for her two touch-downs than did Michigan. The latter team, although beaten, was not disgraced, for the Western boys made their Eastern rivals work hard for every inch of ground they gained. ... The game was a beautiful one for the spectators to look at. Both teams were about as evenly matched as they could be. The Quakers excelled in line bucking and in kicking, while Michigan far outplayed Pennsylvania when it came to skirting the ends.  McLean, Michigan's left half back, was almost invariably used for end running, and his brilliant sprinting around Pennsylvania's ends often brought applause from the followers of the Quakers. The interference accorded him was almost perfect, and this, in a great measure, helped him in gaining ground."<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|title= |newspaper=The New York Times|date=1899-11-12}}</ref></blockquote>
The game also featured a duel between two of the best centers in the country, Penn's [[Pete Overfield]] and Michigan's [[William Cunningham (American football)|William Cunningham]].  Cunningham was Michigan's first ever All-American in 1898, when he was selected as a first-team All-American by [[Casper Whitney]], and Overfield was picked by [[Walter Camp]] as the first-team All-American of 1898.  ''The New York Times'' reported on the match-up of Cunningham and Overfield as follows:<blockquote>"The duel between Cunningnam and Overfield, the centre rushes, was interesting. Both are high-class players, and they played with a dash that was inspiring. Cunningham had much the better of it during the first half, but in the second period Overfield, through better staying qualities, made big holes through Michigan's bulky centre."<ref name=NYT/></blockquote>

===Michigan 28, Case 6===
[[File:William Cunningham (1899).jpg|thumb|right|175px|All-American center [[William Cunningham (American football)|William Cunningham]] faced Penn's [[Pete Overfield]] in 1899.]]
After its road trip to Philadelphia, Michigan faced [[Case Western Reserve University|Case]] at Regents Field in Ann Arbor.  Michigan began the game playing its substitutes, and Case scored the game's first touchdown less than seven minutes into the game. Michigan scored a touchdown but missed the goal after touchdown and trailed Case 6 to 5 at halftime.  In the second half, Michigan's substitutes were replaced by regular varsity players, and a newspaper account indicates that Michigan added 32 points in the second half.<ref>{{cite news|title=Case School Not Strong Enough|newspaper=Nebraska State Journal|date=1899-11-19}}</ref>  However, other records show Michigan's point total as 28.<ref>{{cite news|title=Other Games Yesterday|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1899-11-19}}</ref>

===Michigan 24, Kalamazoo 0===
On the Saturday before Michigan's championship game against Chicago, the Wolverines played Kalamazoo at Regents Field in Ann Arbor.  Michigan won the game easily by a score of 24 to 0.<ref>{{cite news|title=In the West|newspaper=Sunday Herald (Syracuse, NY)|date=1899-11-26}}</ref>

===Wisconsin 17, Michigan 5===
The Western Conference championship was decided in a Thanksgiving Day match between Michigan and Wisconsin played on the National League baseball field in Chicago.  Large numbers traveled from both Michigan and Wisconsin to watch the match, and the crowd was estimated to be 21,000 -- reported to be probably the largest ever to watch a football game in the West.  A newspaper account described the scene as follows:<blockquote>"Probably 21,000 people saw the struggle. Excursion trains were run from Milwaukee, Madison and Marinette, Wis., and from Ann Arbor and Menominee, Mich., and long before the game was called the immense stretches of bleachers and the grandstand at the south end of the field were packed so that hardly an inch of room was left.  The brass bands of both universities were present, and before the game and between the halves marched around the gridiron trying to make themselves heard through the discord of tin horns and hoarse voices."<ref name=Wisc>{{cite news|title=BADGERS KICK WELL: Wisconsin's Eleven too Much for Michigan; Win in a One-Sided Game; Punting of Pat O'Dea a Factor in the Victory|newspaper=Nebraska State Journal|date=1899-12-01}}</ref></blockquote>

Wisconsin won the game by a score of 17 to 6, in large part due to the kicking of [[Pat O'Dea]].  O'Dea accounted for five points with a field goal from the 35-yard line and kicked a long punt to McLean which was fumbled behind the goal line where it was recovered by Wisconsin for a touchdown.  O'Dea was later ejected from the game for slugging.  Wisconsin's weak spot in the game was at left end, where [[Eddie Cochems|Cochems]] gave up many long runs by Michigan, including the Wolverines' lone touchdown on a 45-yard run by McLain.<ref>BADGERS KICK WELL: "Michigan's only touchdown was made by McLain in the second half after a beautiful run of forty-five yards, in which the fleet-footed Michigan man cleared his field without difficulty."</ref>  [[Neil Snow]] played against Cochems and "bothered his man greatly, and frequently put him out of the plays."<ref name=Wisc/>

===All-American===
[[File:Richard France (1899).jpg|thumb|right|175px|The rough play of [[Richard France]] (''pictured'') prompted a punch from Wisconsin's [[Pat O'Dea]], leading to O'Dea's ejection from the 1899 championship game.]]
Prior to 1898, no player from a "Western" school had been selected as a college football All-American.  [[William Cunningham (American football)|Williams Cunningham]] became Michigan's first All-American in 1898.  The [[1899 College Football All-America Team]], as selected by the ''Philadelphia Inquirer'',<ref>{{cite news|title=An All-American Football Team In Fact, Three of Them, and All Picked upon Different Lines|publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=1899-12-11}}</ref>  included three Michigan players:
* [[Neil Snow]] - Snow played at the [[End (American football)|end]] position for the 1899 Wolverines and repeated as an All-American in 1901.  One of the great athletes in the history of the University of Michigan, Snow won more [[varsity letter]]s than any other athlete (four each in baseball, football and track) in the school's history, scored five touchdowns in the [[1902 Rose Bowl|first Rose Bowl game]] in 1902, and was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1960.
*[[John McLean (American football)|John McLean]] - McLean played [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] for the 1899 Wolverines.  He was also a gifted track athlete.  The following summer, he represented the United States and the [[Athletics at the 1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], where he won the silver medal in the [[110 metre hurdles]] with a time of 15.5 seconds.  He went on to coach the [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]] and [[University of Missouri]] football teams.
*[[Richard France]] - France played at the [[Tackle (American football)|tackle]] position for the 1899 Wolverines.  In addition to his selection as an All-American by the ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', France was also a consensus All-Western player in 1899.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sporting Melange|publisher=Nebraska State Journal|date=1899-12-17}}</ref> France drew press coverage for his role in the 1899 Western Conference championship game.  Wisconsin was led that year by [[Pat O'Dea]], considered the greatest kicker in the history of the game to that time.  Wisconsin took an 11<U+2013>0 lead in the game, largely through the play of O'Dea.  There were reports that Michigan's strategy was to put O'Dea out of the game, and he was subjected to a number of rough hits by France and William Cunningham.  On one play, France "came into him like a battering ram after he had punted the ball."<ref name=Wis>{{cite news|title=Wisconsin 17, Michigan 5: Badgers Win Thanksgiving Game at Chicago -- O'Dea Ruled Off Grounds|publisher=Wisconsin State Journal|date=1899-12-01}}</ref>  O'Dea warned France that if he did it again "there would be trouble."<ref name=Wis/>  After another punt, France came for O'Dea again, and O'Dea slugged France in the face.  A Wisconsin newspaper account described the incident as follows: "Meantime O'Dea had been laying out France, hitting him with such force that the big guard was stretched out and but for the time gained through the wrangle at the end of the goal line and the speedy ending of the half, would hardly have been able to continue playing.  O'Dea claimed that the knockout blow was accidental."<ref>{{cite news|title=Thousands Go To Chicago To See Contest: Wisconsin Defeats Michigan To Tune of 17 to 5|publisher=The Daily Northwestern|date=1899-12-01}}</ref> The game's referee saw the blow, and O'Dea was ejected from the game.  Even without O'Dea, Wisconsin hung on in the second half to win the game 17<U+2013>5.
