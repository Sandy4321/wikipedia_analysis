The parish church of St Mary is a [[Grade I listed building]].<ref>{{NHLE|num=1366256|desc=Church of St Mary|accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref>

A sand and gravel pit was established in the south-west of the parish in the 1930s, located parallel and south of Pant Drain, the site's development was driven by the 1930s building boom. The extracted material, which lay less than 1 foot below the ground was washed and grade separated on site by a rotary screen. By 1938 a rail tramway had been built to transport the excavated material to the main road - the line ran southwards from the midpoint of the B1445 between Welwick and Patrington, passing west of Haverfield House, to Oxlands Hill, and used a diesel shunting locomotive capable of hauling 120 tons; the material was transported in short wheelbase side tipping wagons.<ref>{{cite journal| url=| journal = The Times (Hull and Lincolnshire Times)|title = Holderness Geological Curiosity : Golden Sand and Gravel Being Drawn from the Earth| date = 1 October 1938| page =6}}</ref><ref>Ordnance Survey map, 1:10560, 1956.
