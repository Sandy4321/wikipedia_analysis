The '''Norber erratics''' are one of the finest groups of [[glacial erratic]] boulders in Britain. They are found on the southern slopes of [[Ingleborough]], close to the village of [[Austwick]] in the [[Yorkshire Dales]]. The [[Ordnance Survey]] grid reference of the boulder field is SD764698. 

The '''Norber erratics''' are classic [[geomorphology|geomorphological]] features from the glaciation of northern England. In his chapter on the [[Pennines]], Trueman (1949, p.169) wrote: "Particularly well known are the great perched blocks of dark grit which stand on the limestone platform at Norber near Settle."<ref>A.E. Trueman (1949) Geology and Scenery in England and Wales. Pelican, 334pp.</ref>

Many of the [[Millstone Grit]] boulders at the site are perched on pedestals of [[limestone]] up to 30cm high. The boulders were probably deposited by melting ice sheets at the end of the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]], around 12,000 years ago. The pedestals have developed because the [[glacial erratic|erratic]] boulders have protected the underlying [[limestone]] from solution by rainfall, giving estimates of the rate of lowering of the surrounding [[limestone pavement]] of around 25mm per 1000 years.<ref>A.
