==Military career 2==
In 1915, Ord was a military aide on the staff of the governor of Arizona. He was also a liaison with Army unit that included his former regiment. He saw service on the Mexican border due to the rise of tension along the border following the [[Agua Prieta, Sonora|Battle of Agua Prieta]]. This was where [[Pancho Villa]] sustained his greatest defeat and his units were disorganized and wandered around northern [[Mexico]] foraging for supplies. Desperate for food and fresh horses, Pancho Villa camped his army of an estimated 500 horsemen outside of [[Columbus, New Mexico]] on the Mexican side of the border in March of 1916. On March 9, 1916, he invaded the United States for supplies and arms which resulted in the [[Battle of Columbus (1916)|Battle of Columbus.]] Ord had been given the rank of Major and served Arizona well in organizing and arming militia units. No major raids across the border took place in Arizona. <ref name=Special/> 

As the result of his Arizona service, on June 3, 1916, Ord was advanced to the grade of major on the Army retired list. In early 1917, he returned to full active duty, serving at Big Bend, Texas; Fort Sill, Oklahoma; and Tuscaloosa, Alabama.<ref name=Special/> 

In December of 1918, due to complications of his yellow fever sustained in Cuba, he retired due to ill health from the Army.<ref name=Special/> 

==Later life==
In 1920, Ord was residing in Oakland, Alameda, California.<ref name=Search/> Ord was listed as an expert linguist and possessed exceptional artistic ability, devoting much of his leisure time to landscape, marine painting and to writing poetry.<ref name=Special/>

Ord was also an inventor who patented a new type of gold pan and different weapon sights. He was a co-owner of several mines in Arizona, California, Mexico and Utah.<ref name=Special2/> Papers pertaining to the inventions of E.O.C. Ord II are in the special collections section of the [[Bancroft Library]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. These include Ord<U+2019>s patents, original drawings and diagrams, advertising material and instructions on use of the "Gold-Pan-Batea", an improved Gold Pan which recycled water. This lead to the formation of the California Gold Pan Company and later of the Household Utilities Manufacturing Company. Papers include correspondence and business papers of mine holdings and interests in and around California, Arizona, Utah and Mexico. There are also three diaries; 1) One by William Ord in 1869 of surveying and prospecting in California and Neveda. 2) Two by E.O.C. Ord II, from a prospecting trip to Inyo County, California in 1908-1909 and in 1910 to Zero Mine in Arizona.
