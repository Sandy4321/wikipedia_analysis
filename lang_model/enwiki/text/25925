==Features==
===Sedan & Utility===
[[Image:zeta.jpg|thumb|right|Sales brochure for the Zeta Sedan]]
The Zeta Sedan, (also known as the Zeta Runabout) and Utility, were powered by a 324cc Villers engine and were front wheel drive with independent rear trailing arms. The Sedan was not equipped witha a rear hatch so access to the cargo area required removal of the front seats, the ease of which was advertised as a positive feature. The [[chassis]] was steel, with a [[fibreglass]] body enclosing a large but sparse interior. Windows were perspex except for the front windscreen which was laminated glass. The doors were steel with sliding perspex windows.

The tyres for the Sedan and Utility were Michelin 125 R12 as stated in the specifications. The four speed dog clutch [[Villiers Engineering]] gearbox had no reverse so the engine had to be switched off and started backwards which provide four reverse gears. Fuel was delivered by gravity feed from a tank behind the dashboard. The fuel gauge was a plastic pipe running from the top to the bottom of the tank with a graduated glass tube section on the dashboard. As a [[Wheels (magazine)]] road test in 1974 put it "it read anywhere from full to empty depending on gradient, throttle and probably Greenwich mean time".

The Utility was the rarest of the Zeta models with a total of only 8 produced.<ref name=Hopkins>{{cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=Clive|title=A two-stroke of genius|journal=Drive Life|date=16 September 2011|pages=23|url=http://drivelife.realviewtechnologies.com/default.aspx?iid=53741&startpage=page0000023|accessdate=25 September 2011}}</ref> A number were purchased by [[Sydney City Council]]'s Hyde Park fleet.<ref name="Unique Cars and Parts"/> The Utility was mechanically identical to the Sedan.<ref name=Hopkins/>

===Sports===

The two-seater Zeta Sports was introduced in 1964.<ref name=AMM>70 m.p.h. Zeta Sports Gives 44 m.p.g., Australian Motor Manual, July 1964</ref> Body styling was based on the [[Henry Meadows]] Sprint version of the [[Meadows Frisky|Frisky]] microcar, designed by Gordon Bedson and Keith Peckmore,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meadowsfrisky.co.uk/page14.htm|title=The Frisky Sprint|last=Meadows|first=John|coauthors=Keith Peckmore|year=2013|work=The Official Meadows Frisky Website|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref> although Lightburn attributed the design to [[Giovanni Michelotti|Michelotti]].<ref name=AMM/> The fibreglass bodied car weighed {{convert|400|kg|lb|0}} and ran on {{convert|10|in|cm|0}} wheels with all-round [[drum brakes]]. Like the [[Goggomobil Dart]] it lacked doors and bumper bars.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Tony|title=Extra Lemon !|publisher=Bantam|location=Sydney|pages=10<U+2013>13|isbn=1-86325-550-8|year=2005}}</ref> The Zeta Sports was fitted with a West German [[ZF Sachs]] F.M.R. 500 498cc two cylinder, [[Two-stroke cycle|two-stroke]] engine producing {{convert|15.5|kW|hp|0}}. The engine, which had a 70mm bore and a 67mm stroke <ref name=AMM/> was originally designed for and used in the 4 wheel [[FMR Tg500]] microcar. The Zeta Sports was fitted with a 4 speed and reverse sequential gearbox in unit with the engine. 48 examples were produced.<ref>Don Luck, Zeta, Alternative Australian Motoring, Restored Cars #122, May-Jun 1997, page 22</ref>

==Sales history==
[[File:Zeta Utility.JPG|thumb|Zeta Utility. The rear bodywork on this example differs from that shown on the Zeta Utility sales brochure.]]
{{quote|With the Zeta, however, failure was engineered into the product from day one.<ref>''Lemon! 60 Heroic failures of motoring'',p9 , Tony Davis, Random house Australia, 2004</ref>|Tony Davis
|''[[Extra Lemon!]]''}}

As well as the oddness of the design, the vehicle's commercial success was also stymied by unfortunate timing as it was released onto the market at the same time as the [[Morris Mini]], which was only <U+00A3>60 more expensive. As a result only 363 vehicles were sold from 1963 to 1966, including 28 of the Sports model. According to a sign in the National Motor Museum in Birdwood South Australia, 48 of the sports model were manufactured.
