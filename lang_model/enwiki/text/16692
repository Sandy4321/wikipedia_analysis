'''Chester Rows''' consist of covered walkways at the first-floor level behind which are entrances to shops and other premises.  At street level is another set of shops and other premises, many of which are entered by going down a few steps.  The Rows, found in each of the four main streets of the city of [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England, are unique; nothing precisely similar exists anywhere else in the world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ward|2009|p=50.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Bilsborough|1983|p=17.}}</ref><ref name=ccc>{{Citation | url = http://www.virtualchester.org/view/view_theme.php?id=4| title = City Rows | accessdate = 18&nbsp;July 2009| publisher = Chester City Council}}</ref><ref>There are similar structures elsewhere, but nothing precisely similar, nor on the scale of Chester; for example, on the south side of Gerechtigkeitsgasse, [[Bern]], Switzerland, is a short stretch of covered elevated walkway with shops, but the level below is more of a half-storey containing lock-ups rather than full-sized premises.</ref>

Dating from the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] era, the Rows may have been built on top of rubble remaining from the ruins of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] buildings, but their origin is still subject to speculation.  In some places the continuity of the Rows has been blocked by enclosure or by new buildings, but in others modern buildings have retained the Rows in their designs.  [[Undercroft]]s or "[[crypt]]s" were constructed beneath the buildings in the Rows.  The undercrofts were in stone while most of the buildings in the Rows were in timber.

Today about 20 of the stone undercrofts still exist, but at the level of the Rows very little medieval fabric remains.  Many of the buildings containing portions of the Rows are [[listed building|listed]] and some are on the [[National Monuments Record]].  The premises on the street and Row levels are used for a variety of purposes; most are shops, but there are also offices, restaurants, caf<U+00E9>s, and meeting rooms.  Chester Rows are one of the city's main tourist attractions.

==Description==

At street level the shops and other premises are similar to those found in other towns and cities, although many of the premises are entered by going down a few steps.  On the first floor level are more shops and other premises, set back from the street, in front of which is a continuous walkway.  The [[storey]] above this overlaps the walkway, which makes it a covered walkway, and this constitutes what is known as the "Row".  On the street side of the walkways are railings and an area which was used as shelves or stalls for the display of goods. The floors above the level of the Rows are used for commercial or domestic purposes, or for storage.<ref name=morr13>{{Harvnb|Morriss|1993|p=13.}}</ref>  The Rows are present, to a greater or lesser degree, in all the streets radiating from Chester Cross, namely Watergate Street, Northgate Street, Eastgate Street and Upper Bridge Street.  They are continuous on both sides of Upper Bridge Street, along most of Watergate and Eastgate Street, but only for a short stretch along the east side of Northgate Street.  Originally there were also Rows in Lower Bridge Street but these were blocked during the 17th and 18th&nbsp;centuries.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morriss|1993|pp=15, 23.}}</ref>

As the ground floor buildings are usually lower than the street level, they are sometime known as "[[crypt]]s".<ref>{{Harvnb|Morriss|1993|pp=13&ndash;14, 18.}}</ref> However, as [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] points out, this is not a strictly accurate description because the level of the floors of the buildings is a half-storey rather than a full-storey level below the street.<ref name=pev132>{{Harvnb|Pevsner|2003|p=132.}}</ref>

==Origins==
[[File:Chester Row int.jpg|thumb|Inside Watergate Street Row, showing premises on the right and space for stalls and the railings overlooking the street on the left]]

Rows were built in the four main streets leading from Chester Cross,<ref>{{Harvnb|Ward|2009|p=8.}}</ref> each of which originated during the settlement's early development.  In the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] period the main street, now Watergate Street and Eastgate Street, lay on an east-west axis.  It was joined at what is now Chester Cross by the main road from the south, present-day Bridge Street.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ward|2009|p=7.}}</ref>  During the [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] period a road to the north was added, now called Northgate Street.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ward|2009|p=29.}}</ref>  [[Dendrochronology|Dendrochronological]] evidence shows that the Rows go back as far as the 13th&nbsp;century,<ref name=morr13/> but it is unlikely that they originated before 1200. The first record of the Rows appears in 1293, although it is uncertain whether it refers to a Row as it would be recognised today.  The "earliest unambiguous instance" of the use of the term for an elevated walkway is in 1356.<ref name=vch>{{Citation | last = Thacker| first = A. T.| author-link = | last2 = Lewis | first2 = C. P.

Because the Chester Rows are unique and their precise origins are unknown, they have been the subject of speculation.  Chester has suffered from a series of fires.  In 1278 the fire was so severe that almost the entire town within the walls was destroyed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ward|2009|p=51.}}</ref>  It has been suggested that following this fire, the owners were ordered to make their ground floors fireproof, leading to the stone-lined undercrofts.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morriss|1993|p=18.}}</ref><ref name=alcock>{{Citation | last = Alcock| first = N. W. | author-link = |  publication-date = | date = | year = 2001| title = The Origin of the Chester Rows: A Model| edition = | volume = 45| series = Medieval Archaeology| publication-place = | place = | publisher = | pages = 226&ndash;228| page = | id = | isbn = | doi = | oclc = | url = http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-769-1/ahds/dissemination/pdf/vol45/45_226_228.pdf| accessdate = 7&nbsp;July 2009}}</ref>  From this, the suggestion has been made that there was "a general undertaking by the citizens of Chester&nbsp;... to improve the commercial potential of their property by providing two-level access for customers".<ref name=alcock/>

Another theory links the Rows with the [[debris]] left from the Roman occupation of Chester.<ref name=alcock/>  The rubble from the Roman buildings which had fallen into ruin was piled up alongside the streets.  It is suggested that in the medieval period buildings were constructed along the top of this debris.<ref name=ccc/><ref name=alcock/>  The buildings were set back from the street, a footpath passed in front of them, and wheeled vehicles passed along the street below. In time, the properties were improved and, possibly during the 13th&nbsp;century, cellars or undercrofts were excavated in the debris beneath them.  When the buildings were further improved, upper stories were built which overlapped the lower storey, providing a covered walkway.  Stalls or shelves were added on the street side of the walkway for the display of goods, and so the system of Rows was developed.  In a few places, for example at the corner of Eastgate Street and Northgate Street, another building was constructed between the walkway and the street.<ref name=vch/><ref name=alcock/>  It is thought that, apart from a relatively small number of later buildings, the system of the Rows had reached its full extent by about 1350.<ref name=vch/>

==Medieval period==

During the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period the Rows gave access to living accommodation.  The doorway led into a [[hall]], which was usually at right angles to the street.  In some cases the front portion of the hall was used as a separate shop, and in other cases the whole hall was the shop.  In the storey above the hall was the [[Solar (room)|solar]], a room providing private accommodation for the residents.  In some cases, where the hall was larger, there were several shops on its frontage.  Below the Rows, at street level, were crypts or [[undercroft]]s.  Many of these were stone-lined with ribbed [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]], and they were used for storage or for selling more valuable goods. Behind the hall, on the level of the Rows, was more domestic accommodation.  Normally the kitchen was a separate building in the yard behind the house.  The back yard was also used for [[cesspit]]s and for the disposal of rubbish.<ref name=vch/><ref>{{Harvnb|Ward|2009|pp=50&ndash;51.}}</ref>

==Subsequent development==

Although many of the Rows are still continuous, in some areas they have been blocked.  In Lower Bridge Street there was originally a continuous Row; the first building to break the sequence was at the north end of the street, the public house now known as [[The Falcon, Chester|The Falcon]].  In the 17th&nbsp;century this was the town house of the [[Duke of Westminster|Grosvenor family]].  It was rebuilt in 1626, maintaining its section of the Row.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morriss|1993|p=23.}}</ref>  However in 1643, during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] siege of Chester, [[Sir Richard Grosvenor, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Grosvenor]] moved his family there from his country estate at [[Eaton Hall, Cheshire|Eaton Hall]].  In order to increase the size of the house he gained permission to enclose the Row.  This set the fashion for other houses in Lower Bridge Street to enclose their sections of the Row.  Later, completely new houses were constructed which did not incorporate the Row.  One of these was Bridge House, built by Lady Calveley in 1676; it was the first house in Chester to be designed in [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ward|2009|pp=74&ndash;75.}}</ref>  In 1699 John Mather, a lawyer, gained permission to build a new house at 51 Lower Bridge Street, which also resulted in the loss of part of the Row.  In 1728 Roger Ormes, rather than building a new house, enclosed the Row at his home, Tudor House, making it into an additional room.<ref name=ccc/>

During the [[Georgian era]] more sections of the Rows were blocked, especially by commercial development on the north side of Watergate Street.  In 1808 [[Thomas Harrison (architect)|Thomas Harrison]] designed the Commercial Coffee Room in Northgate Street in [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style, with an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] at the ground-floor level, rather than continuing the Row on the first floor.  In 1859&ndash;60 Chester Bank was built in Eastgate Street, again obliterating its part of the Row.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ward|2009|p=86.}}</ref>  However other architects continued the tradition of maintaining the Rows in their designs; examples include the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[Booth Mansion]] of 1700 in Watergate Street,<ref>{{Harvnb|Morriss|1993|p=97.}}</ref> [[Thomas Mainwaring Penson|T. M. Penson's]] [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] [[Crypt Chambers]] of 1858 in Eastgate Street,<ref>{{Harvnb|Morriss|1993|p=106.}}</ref> and buildings in [[Modern architecture|modern style]] constructed in Watergate Street in the 1960s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morriss|1993|p=39.}}</ref>

==Today==

At the Row level, the medieval building was usually built in timber, and few examples remain.  One which does remain is the building known as [[Three Old Arches]].  Consisting of three arches, the frontage of this shop is stone and is probably the earliest identified shopfront in England.  The building also retains its undercroft and hall, the latter also built in stone.<ref name=pev167/><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=470083 |title=Images of England: Number 48&nbsp;and 50&nbsp;Bridge Street and Row|publisher=[[English Heritage]] | accessdate= 13&nbsp;July 2009}}</ref>

According to the records in the [[National Monuments Record]], 14 buildings incorporate sections of Chester Rows.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.pastscape.org.uk/searchresults.aspx?a=0&criteria=chester%20row&search=ALL&rational=q&sort=4&recordsperpage=30| title = Search Results| accessdate = 31&nbsp;July 2009| publisher = [[English Heritage]]: Pastscape}}</ref>  The records in ''[[Images of England]]'' show that at least 95 of the buildings containing sections of the Rows are [[listed building|listed]]; 9 of these are listed as Grade&nbsp;I, 20 as Grade&nbsp;II*, and 66 as Grade&nbsp;II.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/| title = Images of England | accessdate = 1&nbsp;August 2009| publisher = English Heritage}}</ref>  The photographs and text in ''Images of England'' record the uses made by the premises at street level and in the Rows.  Most of these are shops, but other uses include offices, restaurants and caf<U+00E9>s, and private dwellings.  The building at No. 1 Bridge Street has shops at both street and Row levels.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=470041 |title=Images of England: No 1 Bridge Street, Chester |publisher=[[English Heritage]] | accessdate= 1&nbsp;August 2009}}</ref> A [[department store]] occupies the street and Row levels (and the storey above) of Crypt Chambers.<ref name=crypt/>  [[Bishop Lloyd's House]] in Watergate Street has a shop at the street level and above this there are meeting rooms,<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=470440 |title=Images of England: 41&nbsp;Watergate Street, Chester|publisher=[[English Heritage]] | accessdate= 1&nbsp;August 2009}}</ref> and the office of Chester Civic Trust.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.chestercivictrust.org.uk/blpdescr.htm| title = Bishop Lloyd's Palace| accessdate = 16&nbsp;July 2009| publisher = Chester Civic Trust}}</ref>  Booth Mansion, also in Watergate Street, contains an [[auction]] house.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=470430 |title=Images of England: Nos 28&ndash;34&nbsp;Watergate Street and Row, Chester|publisher=[[English Heritage]] | accessdate= 1&nbsp;August 2009}}</ref>  The former [[St Michael's Church, Chester|St Michael's Church]], which is now a [[heritage centre]], includes part of Bridge Street Row in the lowest stage of its tower.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&id=470097 |title=Images of England: Heritage Centre, Chester  |accessdate=1&nbsp;August 2008 |publisher=[[English Heritage]] }}</ref>  A remaining example of a section of a Row with a building between the walkway and the street is No.&nbsp;22&nbsp;Eastgate Street.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&id=470215 |title=Images of England: No.&nbsp;22&nbsp;Eastgate Street, Chester  |accessdate=1&nbsp;August 2008 |publisher=[[English Heritage]] }}</ref>

Since 1995 access to the Rows has been improved by a [[Pedestrian zone|pedestrianisation scheme]], which affects all the streets containing Rows.  Most vehicles are prohibited from using the area between 08:00 and 18:00, although unloading is allowed until 10:30 and from 16:30.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.cheshirewestandchester.gov.uk/transport_and_roads/parking/chester_city_centre_access.aspx | title = City Centre Vehicle Access | publisher = Cheshire West and Chester Council | accessdate = 3&nbsp;August 2009}}</ref>  Chester Rows are a major tourist attraction in the city because of their unique nature, their attractive appearance, and the covered shopping experience they provide.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.visitchester.com/site/chester-p100511| title = Chester | accessdate = 8&nbsp;July 2009 | publisher = Visit Chester and Cheshire}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.visitnorthwest.com/chester/rows.htm| title = The Rows | accessdate = 8&nbsp;July 2009| publisher = Visit North West}}</ref>
