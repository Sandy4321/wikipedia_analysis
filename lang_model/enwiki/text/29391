==Plot summary==
{{expand section|date=April 2013}}
Patrick (Robert Thompson) lies in a coma in a [[Melbourne]] private hospital. He had murdered his mother and her lover three years ago by electrocuting them in the bath. Patrick, who has [[psychokinetic]] powers, falls in love with Kathy ([[Susan Penhaligon]]), the new nurse at the hospital, communicating with her via an electric typewriter. Patrick also uses his psychokinetic powers to control the men in Kathy's life and to defend himself against the hospital's bitter Matron Cassidy ([[Julia Blake]]) who plots to murder him.<ref>{{cite book |last=Murray  |first=Scott  |coauthors=(ed.)  |title=Australian Cinema  |publisher= Allen & Unwin/AFC |location= St.Leonards, NSW. |year=1994  |month=  |page=282  |pages=  |isbn= 1-86373-311-6 }}</ref>

==Production==
This was the second script Everett de Roche had ever written, following ''[[Long Weekend (1978 film)|Long Weeked]]'' (1978). It had been around for a number of years before Richard Franklin became attached. The two men had both worked for Crawford Productions although not together until then. De Roche says when Franklin became involved the script was "a rambling 250 pages" and Franklin taught him the elements of drama and suspense. He says the final scene of Patrick leaping out of his bed was inspired by trip to a carnival Franklin had made where a man in a gorilla suit burst out into the audience, causing everyone to scream. They then started working backwards from this scene.<ref name="everett">[http://www.spectacularoptical.ca/2012/06/an-interview-with-everett-de-roche/ An Interview with Everett de Roche, ''Spectacular Optical'', 1 June 2012] accessed 19 October 2012</ref>

Franklin brought in [[Antony I. Ginnane]] who raised finance. The [[Australian Film Commission]] and Victorian Film Corporation contributed about half the budget, with the rest obtained privately. Ginnane later said he thought De Roche's script was one of the best ever written in Australia.<ref>Beilby, Peter and Scott Murray, <U+2018>Antony I. Ginnane<U+2019>, Cinema Papers, January/February 1979 p178-179</ref>

British film actor [[Susan Penhaligon]] was imported to play the lead, which Ginnane thought helped secure the film a sale in Britain.<ref name="stratton">David Stratton, ''The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival'', Angus & Robertson, 1980 p251-252</ref>

So I thought, well, I'll go to the other extreme and have everybody speaking Queen's English.

''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'' notes the similarity between the movie's plot and that of the novel ''Tetrasomy Two'' by "Oscar Rossiter" (''non de plume'' of Dr. Vernon H.Skeels (1918-2007) ).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/books/2004068109_rossiter16.html|title='Like "Tetrasomy Two," Skeels was a true original '}}</ref>

Richard Franklin says he would refer to this film as "my first film. Even though there were one and a half films before it."<ref name="trash"/>  However he was unhappy with the American release of the film which was re-dubbed into American and recut.<ref name="senses">[http://sensesofcinema.com/2008/48/dossier-on-australian-exploitation/richard-franklin/ Scott Murray, "Richard Franklin: Director/Producer", ''Senses of Cinema'', 12 July 2008] accessed 26 October 2012</ref>
