'''State Route 105''' is a [[state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].  It is {{convert|48.56|mi|km}} long, and begins in [[Raymond, Washington|Raymond]], ending in [[Aberdeen, Washington]].  It connects to [[U.S. Route 101 (Washington)|U.S. Route 101]] at both ends.  While US 101 is a costal route for much of its length along the [[West Coast (US)|West Coast]], between Raymond and Aberdeen it takes a more inland route, and SR 105 parallels [[Willapa Bay]], the [[Pacific Ocean]], and [[Grays Harbor]].

==Route description==
State Route 105 begins at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 101]] in the northern part of [[Raymond, Washington|Raymond]], just north of US 101's intersection with [[State Route 6 (Washington)|State Route 6]].<ref>{{yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&lat=46.68752&lon=-123.729504&mag=4&q1=Raymond%2C%20WA%2C%2098577 |title=Raymond, WA |accessdate=2008-03-20 }}</ref>  It roughly follows the [[Willapa River]] then [[Willapa Bay]] westward, serving the towns of [[Tokeland, Washington|Tokeland]] and [[North Cove, Washington|North Cove]], then goes up the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast and back turns to the east just before [[Westport, Washington|Westport]], where it meets with [[State Route 105 Spur (Washington)|State Route 105 Spur]].<ref name=log /><ref>{{cite map |publisher=Rand McNally |title=The Road Atlas |year=2006 |page=108 |section=I3, I4 |isbn=0528957902}}</ref> It then ends in south [[Aberdeen, Washington|Aberdeen]], near [[Cosmopolis, Washington|Cosmopolis]], where it reconnects to U.S. Route 101.

===Spur routes===
'''State Route 105 Spur''' (more specifically referred to by the [[Washington State Department of Transportation]] (WSDOT) as "State Route 105 Spur Westport") is a spur of [[State Route 105 (Washington)|State Route 105]] that goes north into the town of [[Westport, Washington|Westport]], USA. It snakes through the city streets, initially as Forrest Street, finally ending at the harbor.

The SR 105/105 Spur junction is about 5 miles (8&nbsp;km) north of [[Grayland, Washington]], immediately adjacent to [[Twin Harbors State Park]]. The spur is {{convert|4.02|mi|km}} long.<ref name=log />

'''State Route 105 Spur''' can also refer to a {{convert|0.15|mi|m|adj=on}} section of the [[Aberdeen, Washington|Aberdeen]]-area SR 105/[[U.S. Route 101 (Washington)|U.S. Route 101]] junction specifically referred to by WSDOT as "State Route 105 Spur Boone".

==History==
[[Image:WashawayBeach-OldSR105-2005-June.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Part of the "Old State Road 105" route near "Washaway Beach, Cape Shoalwater" between Grayland and Tokeland, looking SE into Willapa Bay.]]
State Route 105 was added to Washington's state highway system in 1937 as Secondary State Highway 13-A.<ref>{{cite WAstat|year=1937|ch=207}}: "Secondary State Highway No. 13A; beginning at Raymond on Primary State Highway No. 13, thence in a westerly direction by the most feasible route by way of Tokeland, North Cove to the shore of Grays Harbor north of Westport; also beginning at Aberdeen on Primary State Highway No. 13, thence in a southwesterly direction by the most feasible route to a junction with Secondary State Highway No. 13A in the vicinity south of Westport."</ref>  This definition also included the spur north to Westport.  In the [[1964 state highway renumbering (Washington)|1964 state highway renumbering]], SSH 13-A was assigned the designation SR 105.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Washington State Highway Commission]]|url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/NR/rdonlyres/6836215D-E301-43F3-895A-472BD2FDE86A/0/Identification.pdf|format=PDF|title=Identification of State Highways|date=December 1, 1965|accessdate=2008-04-10}}</ref>

Between [[Grayland, Washington|Grayland]] and [[Tokeland, Washington|Tokeland]], SR 105 had to be re-routed inland from Cape Shoalwater, due to currents coming out of Willapa Bay causing severe erosion, taking many acres of land out to sea.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Washington State Department of Ecology]]|url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/sea/coast/erosion/washaway.html|title=Washington's Coast: Hazards - Erosion: Washaway Beach, Cape Shoalwater|accessdate=2008-04-10}}</ref>
