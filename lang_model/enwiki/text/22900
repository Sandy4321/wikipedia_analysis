The '''2nd World Congress of the Comintern''' was a gathering of approximately 220 voting and non-voting representatives of [[Communism|Communist]] and [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] political parties from around the world, held in [[Petrograd]] and [[Moscow]] from July 19 to August 7, 1920.

==History==
===Convention call===

On April 22, 1920, the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]] (ECCI) voted to hold a 2nd World Congress of its member parties at some indefinite date in the near future.<ref name="Riddell1-6">John Riddell (editor and translator), ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!: Proceedings and Documents of the Second Congress, 1920.'' In two volumes. New York: Pathfinder Press, 1991; vol. 1, pg. 6.</ref> This was followed on June 14, 1920, by the formal publication by ECCI of a call for a 2nd World Congress to be held in Moscow one month hence.<ref>Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pp. 5-6.</ref> Political parties pledging allegiance to the organization were urged to send delegations at once.<ref name="Riddell1-6" />

During this period [[Soviet Russia]] was subject to an armed [[blockade]] by land and sea, making travel extremely difficult. Legal passage was possible only through the [[Estonia|Estonian]] port of Revel (known today as [[Tallinn]]), but even this means was difficult due to the systematic denial of [[passport|travel passports]] to radicals intending on traveling to [[Central Europe]].<ref name="Riddell1-6" /> 

Some delegates were forced by circumstances to use false passports and identity documents or to travel without any legal documentation whatsoever, such as by [[stowaway|stowing away]] on a ship.<ref name="Riddell1-7">Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pg. 7</ref> Three [[France|French]] delegates lost their lives in transit, when a small fishing boat setting sail from [[Murmansk]] in an attempt to run the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] blockade went down in stormy weather.<ref name="Riddell1-7" />

===Delegate composition===

The official records of the 2nd World Congress indicate that a total of 218 delegates participated in the proceedings, including 54 representatives of [[Socialism|Socialist]], [[Social Democracy|Social Democratic]], and other non-Communist political parties and 12 representatives of youth organizations.<ref name="Riddell1-8">Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pg. 8</ref>
