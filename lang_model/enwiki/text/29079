'''Terry Goodkind''' (born [[1948]]) is a contemporary [[United States|American]] writer and [[author]] of the best-selling [[epic fantasy]] series, ''[[The Sword of Truth]]'', which according to his publisher [[Tor Books|TOR]] in an August, 2006 press release<ref name="Pressrelease">[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/tvnews.php?id=15750 Press release regarding the production of a Sword of Truth Mini-series]</ref> has more than 10 million copies in print and has been translated into 20 different languages.  In a recent Publishers Weekly article, it was reported that Mr. Goodkind has sold 25 million copies<ref name="copiespublished">[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6573502.html Terry Goodkind Moves to Putnam for Three-Book Deal]</ref> worldwide.

==Biography==
Goodkind was born in 1948 and raised in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], where he also attended schooling in art and Catholic Catechism Instruction.  


Goodkind learned early in his life that he suffered from [[dyslexia]], a cause of constant frustration while he was in high school. He later dropped out of college, and has worked as a carpenter, a violin maker, and a restorer of rare and exotic artifacts and antiques. Prior to starting his career as a writer Goodkind was best known for his realistic marine and wildlife paintings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cgi1.usatoday.com/mchat/20030805003/tscript.htm|title=USA Today Article}}</ref>  In 1993, during the construction of his home on the forested [[Mount Desert Island]] off the coast of [[Maine]] with his wife Jeri, he began to write his first novel, ''Wizard's First Rule'', and his writing career was launched with its publication in 1994. In addition to his home in Maine, Goodkind and his wife built a second home in the desert southwest where he now spends the majority of his time.<ref name = "Official Bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.prophets-inc.com/the_author/|title=Terry Goodkind Bio at terrygoodkind.com}}</ref>

== Career ==
Goodkind's first book, ''[[Wizard's First Rule]]'', was auctioned to publishers in 1993 for six times more than the record price previously paid for a first fantasy novel.<ref>[http://www.sff.net/people/lynn.flewelling/s.goodkind.html Lynn Flewelling interview with Terry Goodkind at sff.net]</ref>  It had a first print run of sixty thousand copies, where three to five thousand is more usual, and became an international bestseller.

Goodkind has subsequently published ten other novels and one novella to great commercial success. All of his books, with the exceptions of ''[[Stone of Tears]]'' and ''Wizard's First Rule'', have appeared on the [[New York Times Bestseller List]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawes.com/pastlist.htm|title=Hawes' archive of New York Times bestsellers from 1994-2005}}</ref> Of his latest novels, ''[[Chainfire]]'' debuted at #3<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawes.com/2005/0501.htm#January%2023|title=Hawes' archive of New York Times bestsellers - Week of January 23, 2005}}</ref> in January 2005, ''[[Phantom (Sword of Truth)|Phantom]]'' at #1<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawes.com/2006/2006-08-06.pdf|title=Hawes' archive of New York Times bestsellers - Week of January 23, 2005}}</ref> in August 2006, and ''[[Confessor (novel)|Confessor]]'' at #2 in November 2007 on the NYT Best Seller List.

== Influences ==
Goodkind has been largely influenced by the books of [[Ayn Rand]] and is a strong supporter of her works and of [[Objectivist philosophy]].  While he acknowledges writing in the fantasy genre, he perceives his novels to be more than just traditional fantasy due to their focus on philosophical and human themes.<ref name="vabooksign">[http://www.prophets-inc.com/the_author/va.html Interview with Terry Goodkind at a Virginia book signing]</ref>

==Themes==
''[[The Sword of Truth]]'' series is considered an [[epic fantasy]] series by both readers and critics alike. The [[Terry Goodkind#Awards and Nominations|awards]] it has been nominated for or won are all fantasy-related, and as the series contains all the standard fantasy elements such as [[dragon]]s, [[magic (fantasy)|magic]], a setting containing a more or less medieval level of technology, and fictional countries, it has been marketed as a fantasy series.   
Despite being placed in the genre by others, Goodkind perceives himself more as a novelist than as a fantasy author.<ref name="vabooksign"/><ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20040831203534/http://www.terrygoodkind.com/chats/PIchat5.php Webchat with Terry Goodkind from web archive], retrieved January 14, 2007</ref> Goodkind believes that using the fantasy genre allows him to better tell his stories and better convey the human themes and emotions which he desires to share with the reader.  Regardless of the genre of his novels, Goodkind states his main goal in writing is to inspire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifidimensions.com/Aug03/terrygoodkind.htm|title=Sci-Fi Dimensions Interview}}</ref>

Each ''Sword of Truth'' novel includes a [[Wizard's Rule]] of the fictional universe which also serves as a thematic statement for the novel.

== Published works ==
Goodkind's novels include:
* ''[[Wizard's First Rule]]'' (1994)
* ''[[Stone of Tears]]'' (1995)
* ''[[Blood of the Fold]]'' (1996)
* ''[[Temple of the Winds]]'' (1997)
* ''[[Soul of the Fire]]'' (1999)
* ''[[Faith of the Fallen]]'' (2000)

* ''[[Chainfire]]'' (2005)
* ''[[Phantom (Sword of Truth)|Phantom]]'' (2006)
* ''[[Confessor (novel)|Confessor]]'' (2007)

In addition, Goodkind wrote a short story titled ''[[Debt of Bones]]'' for the 1998 anthology ''[[Legends (book)|Legends]]'', edited by [[Robert Silverberg]]. The novel takes place in the ''[[The Sword of Truth|Sword of Truth]]'' universe and is set a few decades before the events in the main series. In 2001, the story was published as a stand-alone [[novella]].

The last book in the current story arc, entitled ''Confessor'', was released on November 13, 2007.<ref>[http://www.terrygoodkind.com/his_works/confessor.html Announcement of final book in series.]</ref>

Recently Goodkind has signed a contract to publish three mainstream novels with G.P. Putnam's Sons, moving away from the Sword of Truth series for the first time in his career, though future volumes of Sword of Truth will continue to be published by Tor, when and if the author chooses to return to that world.

==Other media==
