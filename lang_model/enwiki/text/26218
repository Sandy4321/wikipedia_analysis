And it<U+2019>s the total opposite when Puff in the studio. He listening to the snare, to the high hat, to the kick. All previous of my five albums whenever I mixed my album and went to master it I could master my album in three hours. With the process Puff put it through it took three days. Yeah, so it was like giving it a <U+2018>90s feel<U+2026>I was in the studio. I<U+2019>m smoking. I<U+2019>m drinking. And Puff just said <U+2018>This album, this album it<U+2019>s missing one thing.

Upon its release, ''Mastermind'' was met with generally positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 67, which indicates "generally favorable reviews", based on 16 reviews.<ref name="metacritic1"/> Nick Catucci of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the album an A<U+2013>, saying "As always, he's got a gifted ear for rumbly, deep-gloss beats. "[[Sanctified (song)|Sanctified]]", which Kanye produced and raps on, sounds like platinum mallets drumming on shipping containers. His flow too remains flawlessly weighted. He's leisurely and precise even on the theatrically dark "In Vein", where he raps fast to play off the Weeknd's cynical come-ons. The bleaker the setting, the brighter Ross shines."<ref name="autogenerated1"/> David Jeffries of [[AllMusic]] said, "''Mastermind''<U+2014>Ross' annual stomp-and-swagger album, 2014 edition<U+2014>could be swapped out with 2009's ''Deeper Than Rap'' and only those burnt out on the album would know the difference, but when being stuck in a rut means you grind your wheels and all that spews out is gold, you only need to look to successful artists like the always funky James Brown, the always rockin' AC/DC, and the always stoned Devin the Dude for guidance."<ref name="allmusic1"/> Jabbari Weekes of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' stated, "Much like Ross' affinity for mink coats, ''Mastermind'' is grandiose in its presentation, but it still only shows the surface of the man behind it."<ref name="exclaim1"/> Mikael Wood of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said, "As ''Mastermind'''s mastermind, though, Ross seems on auto-pilot here."<ref name="latimes1"/> Sheldon Pearce of [[HipHopDX]] stated, "''Mastermind'' simply lacks flair. It doesn<U+2019>t possess the pizzazz of ''Teflon Don'', which made Ross a power player or the pure gaudiness of ''Rich Forever'', which perfected his aesthetic. Rick Ross has seemingly run out of moves."<ref name="hiphopdx1"/> Brandon Soderberg of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' said, "This is Ross at his least cohesive and most clueless since his 2006 debut, ''Port of Miami''. He has finally, totally lost himself in malleable self-mythology. His grip on reality has never been especially tight; that he found a way to further lose his way is actually strangely admirable, isn't it?"<ref name="autogenerated2"/>

Dan Rys of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' stated, "What Ross does well, and what he does again on ''Mastermind'', is put together a body of work that is as formidable as he is, and taken as a whole it<U+2019>s impossible to call this anything other than a very good album. Where people like Kanye and Drake and Kendrick Lamar keep winning by shaking up the formula and dabbling in the unexpected, Ross long ago identified his lane, and he is the undisputed kingpin of his brash brand of hip-hop. Ross die-hards will not be disappointed; anyone looking for something new and different was probably looking in the wrong place to begin with. ''Mastermind'' is a powerful album, an album with an identity, and one that has some solid songs and a handful of hits. Ross delivers just what he promised."<ref name="xxlmag1"/> Craig Jenkins of [[Pitchfork Media]] gave the album a 5.8 out of 10, saying "''Mastermind'' finds Ross at a ''Truman Show'' moment: his character<U+2019>s reached the logical end of its universe. Going forward, he can either break out or keep up a jig he knows that we know is way past expired."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19097-rick-ross-mastermind/ |title=Rick Ross: Mastermind |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2014-03-06 |accessdate=2014-03-12}}</ref> Kevin Ritchie of ''[[Now (magazine)|Now]]'' gave the album four out of five stars, saying "A tighter track list homing in on its sombre (and stoner) moods would<U+2019>ve been bolder, but to his credit Ross avoids commercial trendiness in favour of more personal <U+2013> if familiar <U+2013> forays into Philly soul, funk, 90s hip-hop and South Beach glam (courtesy of producer Scott Storch on the stellar Supreme)."<ref>{{cite web|last=Ritchie |first=Kevin |url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/music/story.cfm?content=196932 |title=Rick Ross &#124; NOW Magazine |publisher=Nowtoronto.com |date=2014-03-06 |accessdate=2014-03-12}}</ref> Michael Madden of [[Consequence of Sound]] gave the album a C, saying "The main tenet of Ross<U+2019>s Maybach Music Group is loyalty, and Ross is loyal to his fans on ''Mastermind'': it<U+2019>s more or less what we<U+2019>re used to from him. It sounds like the album Ross wanted to make, as inspired by heroes like Dilla, and Onyx, and Wu-Tang Clan, and Biggie, and Camp Lo."<ref>{{cite web|last=Madden |first=Michael |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/03/album-review-rick-ross-mastermind/ |title=Album Review: Rick Ross <U+2013> Mastermind |publisher=Consequence of Sound |date=2014-03-07 |accessdate=2014-03-12}}</ref>
