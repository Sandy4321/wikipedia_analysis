{{Cranial nerves short}}

The '''optic nerve''', also known as '''cranial nerve 2,''' transmits visual information from the [[retina]] to the [[brain]]. Derived from the [[embryo]]nic [[retinal ganglion cell]], a diverticulum located in the [[diencephalon]], the optic nerve does not regenerate after transection.

==Anatomy==
The optic nerve is the second of twelve paired [[cranial nerve]]s but is considered to be part of the [[central nervous system]], as it is derived from an outpouching of the [[diencephalon]] during embryonic development. As a consequence, the fibres are covered with myelin produced by [[oligodendrocyte]]s, rather than [[Schwann cell]]s, which are found in the [[peripheral nervous system]], and are encased within the [[meninges]].  Peripheral neuropathies like [[Guillain-Barr<U+00E9> syndrome]] do not affect the optic nerve.

The optic nerve is ensheathed in all three [[meninges|meningeal]] layers ([[dura mater|dura]], [[arachnoid mater|arachnoid]], and [[pia mater]]) rather than the [[epineurium]], [[perineurium]], and [[endoneurium]] found in peripheral nerves.  Fibre tracks of the mammalian central nervous system (as opposed to the peripheral nervous system) are incapable of regeneration, and, hence, optic nerve damage produces irreversible blindness.  The fibres from the [[retina]] run along the optic nerve to nine primary visual nuclei in the brain, whence a major relay inputs into the [[primary visual cortex]].

The optic nerve is composed of [[retina]]l [[ganglion cell]] axons and support cells. It leaves the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit]] (eye socket) via the [[optic canal]], running postero-medially towards the [[optic chiasm]], where there is a partial decussation (crossing) of fibres from the temporal visual fields (the nasal hemi-retina) of both eyes. The proportion of decussating fibers varies between species, and is correlated with the degree of binocular vision enjoyed by a species.<ref>Textbook of Veterinary Anatomy, 4th Edition. Dyce, Sack and Wensing</ref> Most of the [[axon]]s of the optic nerve terminate in the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] from where information is relayed to the visual cortex, while other axons terminate in the [[pretectal nucleus]] and are involved in reflexive eye movements. Other axons terminate in the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] and are involved in regulating the sleep-wake cycle.  Its diameter increases from about 1.6&nbsp;mm within the eye to 3.5&nbsp;mm in the orbit to 4.5&nbsp;mm within the cranial space.  The optic nerve component lengths are 1&nbsp;mm in the globe, 24&nbsp;mm in the orbit, 9&nbsp;mm in the optic canal, and 16&nbsp;mm in the cranial space before joining the optic chiasm.  There, partial decussation occurs, and about 53% of the fibers cross to form the optic tracts.  Most of these fibres terminate in the lateral geniculate body.<ref>citationneeded</ref>

From the lateral geniculate body, fibers of the [[optic radiation]] pass to the [[visual cortex]] in the [[occipital lobe]] of the brain.  In more specific terms, fibers carrying information from the contralateral superior visual field traverse [[Meyer's loop]] to terminate in the lingual gyrus below the calcarine fissure in the occipital lobe, and fibers carrying information from the contralateral inferior visual field terminate more superiorly, to the [[cuneus]].

==Physiology ==
The eye's [[Blind spot (vision)|blind spot]] is a result of the absence of [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]]s in the area of the retina where the optic nerve leaves the eye.

Each human optic nerve contains between 770,000 and 1.7 million nerve fibers,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Human optic nerve fiber count and optic disc size|journal=Investigative Opthalmology & Visual Science|date=May 1992|first=Jost B.|last=Jonas|coauthors=et al|volume=33|issue=6}}</ref> which are axons of the [[retinal ganglion cells]] of one retina. In the [[fovea]], which has high acuity, these ganglion cells connect to as few as 5 [[photoreceptor cell]]s; in other areas of retina, they connect to many thousand photoreceptors.

==Role in disease==
{{main|List of eye diseases and disorders}}
Damage to the optic nerve typically causes permanent and potentially severe loss of [[Visual perception|vision]], as well as an abnormal [[Pupil constriction|pupillary reflex]], which is diagnostically important. The type of [[visual field]] loss will depend on which portions of the optic nerve were damaged.  In general:
* Damage ''proximal'' to the optic chiasm causes loss of vision in the visual field of the same side only.
* Damage ''in'' the chiasm causes loss of vision laterally in both visual fields ([[bitemporal hemianopsia]]). It may occur in large [[pituitary adenoma]]ta.
* Damage ''distal'' to the chiasm causes loss of vision in one eye but affecting both visual fields: The visual field affected is located on the opposite side of the lesion.

Injury to the optic nerve can be the result of congenital or inheritable problems like [[Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy]], glaucoma, trauma, toxicity, inflammation, ischemia, infection (very rarely), or compression from tumors or [[aneurysms]].  By far, the three most common injuries to the optic nerve are from glaucoma, optic neuritis (especially in those younger than 50 years of age), and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (usually in those older than 50).

[[Glaucoma]] is a group of diseases involving loss of retinal [[ganglion cell]]s causing [[optic atrophy|optic neuropathy]]  in  a pattern of  [[peripheral vision]] loss, initially sparing central vision.

[[Optic neuritis]] is inflammation of the optic nerve. It is associated with a number of diseases, the most notable one being [[multiple sclerosis]].

[[Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy]] is a particular type of infarct that affects patients with an anatomical predisposition and cardiovascular risk factors.

[[Optic nerve hypoplasia]] is the underdevelopment of the optic nerve causing little to no vision in the affected eye.

[[Optometrist]]s and [[Ophthalmologist]]s can detect and diagnose some optic nerve diseases but, those sub-specialists that are [[neuro-ophthalmologist]]s, are often best suited to diagnose and treat diseases of the optic nerve.

The International Foundation for Optic Nerve Diseases [[IFOND]] sponsors research and information on a variety of optic nerve disorders and may provide general direction.
