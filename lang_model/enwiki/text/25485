'''''Danton''''' was a [[pre-dreadnought]] [[battleship]] of the [[French Navy]] and the [[lead ship]] of [[Danton class battleship|her class]]. She was a technological leap in battleship development for the French Navy, as she was the first ship in the fleet with [[turbine engine]]s. However, like all battleships of her type, she was completed after the [[Royal Navy]] battleship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}, and as such she was outclassed before she was even commissioned.

During her career ''Danton'' was sent to [[Great Britain]] to honor the coronation of George V, and later served in [[World War I]] as an escort for supply ships and [[Troopship|troop transport]]s, guarding them from elements of the German Navy. While en route to aid a blockade, she was torpedoed and sunk on 19 March 1917 by a [[Germany|German]] [[U-boat]], leaving 296 men dead. The location of the wreck remained a mystery until an underwater survey team inadvertently discovered the battleship in December 2007. In February 2009, the wreck was confirmed to be ''Danton''. The ship is in remarkably good shape for her age. ''Danton'' rests upright on the ocean floor, and most of the original equipment is reported to be intact.

Although the {{sclass|Danton|battleship|6}}s were a significant improvement from the preceding {{Sclass|Libert<U+00E9>|battleship|4}}, especially with the 3,000-ton displacement increase, they were outclassed by the advent of the [[dreadnought]] well before they were completed. This, combined with other poor traits, including the great weight in coal they had to carry, made them rather unsuccessful ships, though their numerous rapid-firing guns were of some use in the Mediterranean.{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=196}}

''Danton'' was laid down at the [[Arsenal de Brest]] in February 1906, launched on 4 July 1909, and commissioned into the French Navy on 1 June 1911. The ship was {{convert|146,6|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|25.8|m|abbr=on}} and a full-load [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9.2|m|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|19736|MT|sp=us}} at full load and had a crew of 681 officers and enlisted men. She was powered by four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]]s with twenty-six [[Belleville boiler]]s, the first French warship to use turbines. They were rated at {{convert|22500|shp|lk=in}} and provided a top speed of around {{convert|19|kn|lk=in}}. Coal storage amounted to {{convert|2027|MT|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=196}}{{sfn|''Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers''|p=1010}}

''Danton''{{'}}s main battery consisted of four [[305mm/45 Mod<U+00E8>le 1906 gun]]s mounted in two twin [[gun turret]]s, one forward and one aft. The secondary battery consisted of twelve [[240mm/50 Mod<U+00E8>le 1902 gun]]s in twin turrets, three on either side of the ship. A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against [[torpedo boat]]s. These included sixteen {{convert|75|mm|abbr=on}} L/65 guns and ten {{convert|47|mm|abbr=on}} guns. The ship was also armed with two {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s. The ship's [[belt armor|main belt]] was {{convert|270|mm|abbr=on}} thick and the main battery was protected by up to {{convert|300|mm|abbr=on}} of armor. The [[conning tower]] also had 300&nbsp;mm thick sides.{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=196}}

== Service ==

[[File:French battleship Danton.JPG|thumb|''Danton'' underway]]

In May 1909, at the launching ceremony for ''Danton'', socialist activists prevented the ship from leaving the stocks.{{sfn|Goldstein & Avery|p=166}} The ship was eventually launched on 4 July 1909. A week after she was completed, she was sent to the [[United Kingdom]] in honour of the [[Coronation of the British monarch|Coronation of George V]] in 1911. Upon her return to France, ''Danton'' was assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron, along with her sister ships and the two powerful [[dreadnought]]s [[French battleship Courbet (1911)|''Courbet'']] and [[French battleship Jean Bart (1911)|''Jean Bart'']].{{sfn|''New International Encyclopedia''|p=148}} In 1913, while off [[Hy<U+00E8>res]] in the Mediterranean, ''Danton'' suffered an explosion in one of her gun turrets, which killed three men and injured several others.{{sfn|''The American Library Annual''|p=27}}

''Danton'' served in [[World War I]] in the [[Mediterranean Fleet (France)|French Mediterranean Fleet]]. At the outbreak of the war in early August 1914, she was assigned to guard convoys bringing French soldiers from North Africa, to protect from attack by the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben}} and [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Breslau}}, which were operating in the area. At the time, she remained in the 1st Battle Squadron alongside her sister ships, under the command of Vice Admiral Chocheprat.{{sfn|Corbett & Newbolt|pp=61<U+2013>62}} By 16 August, the French naval commander, Admiral [[Augustin Bou<U+00E9> de Lapeyr<U+00E8>re|de Lapeyr<U+00E8>re]], took the bulk of the French fleet from [[Malta]] to the entrance of the [[Adriatic]] to keep the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] bottled up.{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=258}}

=== Sinking ===

''Danton'', commanded by Captain Delage, was torpedoed by {{SMU|U-64|Germany|2}}, commanded by [[Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant#Germany|''Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant'']] Robert Moraht, at 13:17 on 19 March 1917, {{convert|22|mi|nmi km}} south-west of [[Sardinia]]. The battleship was returning to duty from a refit in [[Toulon]] and was bound for the Greek island of [[Corfu]] to join the [[Otranto Barrage|Allied blockade]] of the [[Strait of Otranto]]. ''Danton'' was carrying more men than normal, as many were crew members of other ships at Corfu, and had been zig-zagging to foil enemy submarines. The ship sank in 45 minutes; 806 men were rescued by the destroyer ''[[Claymore class destroyer|Massue]]'' and nearby patrol boats, but 296, including Captain Delage, went down with the ship.{{sfn|BBC, "Danton wreck"}} ''Massue'' attacked ''U-64'' with depth charges, but the U-boat successfully evaded her attacker.{{sfn|Greenslade|p=1077}}
