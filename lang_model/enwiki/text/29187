'''Akashdeep Aerostat''' system has been developed by Aerial Delivery Research & Development Establishment (ADRDE), Agra Cantt, a laboratory under Defence Research & Development organization ([[DRDO]]) of India. It was the star exhibit at the 2011 [[Aero India]] show.<ref>{{cite news |title=On its maiden flight, Akashdeep will be India<U+2019>s eye in the sky during Aero India 2011 |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report_on-its-maiden-flight-akashdeep-will-be-indias-eye-in-the-sky-during-aero-india-2011_1495949 |work=[[Daily News & Analysis]] |date=18 January 2011 |accessdate=31 March 2011 }}</ref>

==Description==
The Akashdeep aerostat is a  medium-sized (35 metres long, 23 metres high) [[helium]]-filled [[balloon]] with a volume of 2,000 cubic metres tethered to the ground with cables.  It can carry a 300&nbsp;kg [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] to an altitude of 1,000 meters. It can survey areas up to 20&nbsp;km away and  with advanced cameras and [[radar]], its range is variously reported as 60&nbsp;km or 100&nbsp;km. The aerostat can used for [[surveillance]], [[intelligence]], [[broadcasting]] communication relay and [[jamming]] of electronic systems,

==Payload==
Akashdeep aerostat system carry gyro-stabilized [[electro-optic]] and COMINT ([[communication intelligence]]) system for capturing and analyzing all types of communication in air and also have [[thermal camera]] for surveillance at night and in low visibility condition. Various other ELINT ([[electronic intelligence]]) and RADAR payloads are also being developed indigenously.

==Development==
[[DRDO]] has spent around Rs 70 [[crore]] on research and development of the device. It was under development for four years. A single fully developed unit is expected to cost Rs 16-20 crore each. The helium balloon is likely to be priced at Rs six to seven crore

==Test Trial==
On 25 December 2010, a [[prototype]] performed surveillance on [[Agra]] and intercepted a variety of communications by flying up to an altitude of one km. The complete balloon system, ground-based command and control systems and the payloads were integrated for the three-day trial that culminated on 28 December 2010.  Health monitoring of [[aerostat]] and simultaneous
command and controlling of payload from ground control station was demonstrated successfully. The test carried was of platform itself to carry limited payload having lighter sensors. A Radar variant similar to Aerostats fielded by the [[Indian Air Force]], which was imported from [[Israel]], will take time to develop and testing .

==Deployment==
The Akashdeep aerostat system is expected to be delivered to the [[armed forces]] in the near future. The system will be used by Indian defence services, [[paramilitary]] forces as well as have [[civilian]] applications including [[disaster management]].

==Variant==

[[ADRDE]] plans to build a second type of aerostat system known as '''[[Nakshatra]]''' for up to a height of 4500-5,000 meters and having a range variously reported as 200<U+2013>250&nbsp;km or 450&nbsp;km with a payload capacity of 800&nbsp;kg to 1 tonne and 17,000 cubic metre volume.
