[[Adelaide United FC]] had a successful Season One of the [[A-League]] winning the Minor Premiership before choking in the Finals Series and finishing third. United will look to improve on this opening effort with a bigger and better Season Two. [[Adelaide United FC|Adelaide]] began their 2006-07 season with a 2-2 draw with local club [[Adelaide Galaxy]] and a 2-1 win over a State Select. This was followed up with a highly successful pre-season cup which the Reds won defeating Central Coast on penalties in the final.

United have also signed [[Jason Spagnuolo]] and [[Greg Owens]] on long-term deals after they impressed during their 4-week stay late last season. [[Qu Shengqing]] originally left Adelaide to return to China but has now signed for another A-League season. [[Nathan Burns]] joins Adelaide from the [[Australian Institute of Sport - Football (soccer)|A.I.S]].

==Rom<U+00E1>rio==
Adelaide United are currently linked with [[Brazilian]] football legend [[Rom<U+00E1>rio]]. The [[1994 World Cup]] winner is still attempting to score 1,000 goals and be up there with [[Pel<U+00E9>]] as the all-time greatest scorer. Rom<U+00E1>rio, 40, will play for the Reds on a four week guest stint of which each club is allowed to sign two players. Last year, [[Sydney FC]] signed [[Kazuyoshi Miura|Kazuyoshi "Kazu" Miura]] for four [[A-League]] matches and the Club World Championships and this season they are set to sign Italian forward [[Benito Carbone]]. The [[Newcastle United Jets]] are also reportedly interested in a guest player, former 1990's English striker [[Stan Collymore]].

The [[Football Federation Australia]] has agreed to let Adelaide United sign Rom<U+00E1>rio. This came days after they said no to the Jets in their chase for Collymore. Rom<U+00E1>rio is still playing for [[Miami FC]] in the [[United Soccer Leagues]] which is America's second division. He is currently on 984 career goals and needs 16 more to reach the 1,000 mark which he says has become an obsession.

It was reported in [[The Advertiser]] on Wednesday [[September 27]], [[2006]], that the [[Sultan of Brunei]], [[Hassanal Bolkiah]] had inquired about [[Rom<U+00E1>rio]]. The Sultan could offer much bigger money than Adelaide United and things could completely turn around. The article also stated the matches that Rom<U+00E1>rio is most likely to play. Under the deal that United wish to sign himon, Rom<U+00E1>rio would play two matches for his current club [[Miami FC]] against Adelaide United and two days later against an [[Football Federation of South Australia|FFSA Select Team]] with both of these matches at [[Hindmarsh Stadium]]. He would then play four [[A-League]] matches for United against the Mariners in [[Gosford]], followed by three home matches against [[Melbourne Victory FC|Melbourne]], [[New Zealand Knights FC|New Zealand]] and [[Newcastle United Jets|Newcastle]]. United are also reportedly looking at the option of signing him for the rest of the A-League season.

On Friday [[September 29]], [[2006]], Adelaide United Football Club released an [http://adelaideunited.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=5301&pageid=147 official statement] on their website which confirmed the signing of Rom<U+00E1>rio to a four match guest stint. He will play four [[A-League]] matches for United against [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast]] in [[Gosford]], followed by three home matches against [[Melbourne Victory FC|Melbourne Victory]], [[New Zealand Knights FC|NZ Knights]] and [[Newcastle United Jets|Newcastle Jets]].

==Pre-season friendlies==
Adelaide United played two major pre-season firendlies. They began with a 2-2 draw with Galaxy and played in front of a 1500 strong crowd at the Marden Sports Complex against a Super League Select.

==A-League Pre-Season Cup==
United performed well in the group stage beating [[Melbourne Victory]] before draws against the Mariners and Perth. They failed to take advantage of the Bonus Round offer only beating the NZ Knights 1-0. This meant that they would meet [[Sydney FC]] in [[Wollongong]], continuing a strong rivalry formed in Season One. Adelaide's [[Kristian Rees]] scored an injury time winner to send the Reds through to their first ever final. United won this match on penalties after Andre Gumprecht cancelled out Carl Veart's spectacular [[Bicycle kick|overhead bicycle kick]]. [[Stewart Petrie]] was the unlucky Mariner to miss while [[Carl Veart]] was the hero with the winning spot kick.

Adelaide United are looking to build upon their successful opening season in which they won the minor premiership. They choked in the finals however and their aim for Season Two is to achieve results in the Finals Series. They open the season with away matches in [[Melbourne]] and [[Auckland]].

====Round 1====
----
{{footballbox | date=[[August 25]], [[2006]]<br/ >20:00
|team1 = [[Image:MelbVictory-logo.svg|25px]] {{AL-MV}} |score =  2&ndash;0 |report= [http://www.a-league.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=4789&pageid=1 (Report)]<br/>[http://www.a-league.com.au/scoreboard/0000430075/scoreboard.html (Summary)] |team2 =  {{AL-AU}} [[Image:AUFCsmall.jpg|25px]]

A thouroughly deserved win for Melbourne who dominated. The three Brazilians impressed particularly [[Alessandro Viana da Silva|Alessandro]] who won the penalty and gave Adelaide's [[Richie Alagich]] a lot of trouble down the flanks. [[Grant Brebner]] was also very good. For Adelaide the likes of [[Shengqing Qu]], [[Travis Dodd]], [[Carl Veart]] did not produce their best football and Adelaide's attack was toothless.

====Round 2====
----
{{footballbox | date=[[September 2]], [[2006]]<br/ >12:30
|team1 = [[Image:Nzknights.jpg|25px]] {{AL-NZK}} |score =  1&ndash;0|report= [http://www.a-league.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=4899&pageid=11 (Report)]<br/>[http://www.a-league.com.au/scoreboard/0000430080/scoreboard.html (Summary)]|team2 = {{AL-AU}} [[Image:AUFCsmall.jpg|25px]]
|goals1 = [[Malik Buari]] 88' |goals2 = |stadium = [[North Harbour Stadium]]<br />'''Attendance:''' 4,100<br />'''Referee:''' [[Peter Green]] ([[Football Federation Australia|Australia]])}}

Another lacklustre performance from Adelaide as the much-improved New Zealand Knights stole all three points with an early contender for goal of the season from Ghanaian midfielder [[Malik Buari]]. [[Sean Devine]], [[Jonti Richter]] and [[Darren Bazeley]] were all solid contributors for NZ while the entire Adelaide side played well below their best.

====Round 3====
----
{{footballbox | date=[[September 8]], [[2006]]<br/ >19:30
|team1 = [[Image:AUFCsmall.jpg|25px]] {{AL-AU}} |score =  5&ndash;1|report=[http://www.a-league.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=5001&pageid=11 (Report)]<br/>[http://www.a-league.com.au/scoreboard/0000430083/scoreboard.html (Summary)]|team2 = {{AL-NJ}} [[Image:Newcastle United Jets.jpg|25px]] 
|goals1 = [[Fernando Rech|Fernando]] 8', 72'<br/>[[Robert Cornthwaite]] 19'<br/>[[Qu Shengqing]] 28'<br/>[[Andrew Durante]] [[Own goal|(OG)]] 65'|goals2 = [[Mark Bridge]] 52' |stadium = [[Hindmarsh Stadium]]<br />'''Attendance:''' 8,785<br />'''Referee:''' [[Mark Shield]] ([[Football Federation Australia|Australia]])}}

Adelaide returns to form with an emphatic 5-1 demolition of the Newcastle United Jets on a cold, wet Friday night at Hindmarsh Stadium. Nothing went right for the Jets as United scored 3 times in the first half an hour with all 3 goals beginning with set pieces. Fernando got the ball rolling as he turned in a [[Jason Spagnuolo]] free kick. Robert Cornthwaite followed up a superb [[Ross Aloisi]] free kick and then Chinese striker Qu scored directly from a free kick. Jets striker Bridge pulled one back for the Jets in the second half but defender Durante scored a horrendous own goal. [[Bobby Petta]] impressed on his debut match for the Reds.

====Round 4====
----
{{footballbox | date=[[September 16]], [[2006]]<br/ >18:30
|team1 = [[Image:AUFCsmall.jpg|25px]] {{AL-AU}} |score =  3&ndash;0 |report= [http://www.a-league.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=5110&pageid=1 (Report)]<br/>[http://www.a-league.com.au/scoreboard/0000430088/scoreboard.html (Summary)]|team2 = {{AL-PG}} [[Image:PerthGlory FC.gif|25px]]
|goals1 = [[Fernando Rech|Fernando]] 14'<br/>[[Travis Dodd]] 34'<br/>[[Jamie Coyne]] (og) 50' |goals2 = |stadium = [[Hindmarsh Stadium]]<br />'''Attendance:''' 11,474<br />'''Referee:''' [[Peter O'Leary]] ([[Football Federation Australia|Australia]])}}

Adelaide United put in their second successive impressive performance and they were simply too good for the Glory who seemed to have no power going forward without injured stars [[Stan Lazaridis]] and [[Bobby Despotovski]]. United created chances from the first whistle with Dodd going close before [[Fernando Rech|Fernando]] opened the scoring with a shot in the 14th minute which beat goalkeeper [[Aleks Vrteski]]. The second goal came as the Glory defence sat back allowing superb winger Dodd too much time and space and he blasted the ball straight through Vrteski to make it 2-0. United added the third goal five minutes after the interval as Fernando's shot which was heading wide of the target took a wicked deflection off [[Jamie Coyne]] and fooled Vrteski. Coyne was credited with the own goal. United then created late chances through subs [[Bobby Petta]] and debutant [[Dez Giraldi]] but the score remained at 3-0.

====Round 5====
----
{{footballbox | date=[[September 22]], [[2006]]<br/ >20:00
|team1 = [[Image:Queensland Roar FC.gif|25px]] {{AL-QR}} |score =  0&ndash;0|report= [http://www.a-league.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=5208&pageid=1 (Report)]<br/>[http://www.a-league.com.au/scoreboard/0000430092/scoreboard.html (Summary)] |team2 = {{AL-AU}} [[Image:AUFCsmall.jpg|25px]]
|goals1 = |goals2 = |stadium = [[Suncorp Stadium]]<br />'''Attendance:''' 16,143<br />'''Referee:''' [[Matthew Breeze]] ([[Football Federation Australia|Australia]])}}

Queensland dominated their match against Adelaide and certainly showed why they are title contenders early in the season. Their five-man attack consisting of [[Ante Milicic]], [[Reinaldo Elias da Costa|Reinaldo]], [[Zhang Yuning|Yuning Zhang]], [[Simon Lynch]] and [[Dario Vidosic]] is certain to score goals this season and only some outstanding saves by Reds 'keeper [[Robert Bajic]] kept Adelaide in the game. [[Shengqing Qu]] will come under the [[Football Federation Australia|FFA]] review panel's scrutiny for his headbutt on Roar captain [[Chad Gibson]]. At the end of the match a flurry of Queensland chances, most of which fell to Zhang, weren't enough to secure the points for QLD even though they thouroughly deserved the win.

====Round 6====
----
{{footballbox | date=[[October 2]], [[2006]]<br/ >16:30
|team1 = [[Image:AUFCsmall.jpg|25px]] {{AL-AU}} |score =  1&ndash;4|report= [http://www.a-league.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=5330&pageid=1 (Report)]<br/>[http://www.a-league.com.au/scoreboard/0000430098/scoreboard.html (Summary)]|team2 = {{AL-SFC}} [[Image:SydneyFClogo.jpg|25px]]
|goals1 = [[Nathan Burns]] 55'|goals2 = [[Ruben Zadkovich]] 37'<br/>[[Travis Dodd]] (og) 58'<br/>[[Sasho Petrovski]] 80'<br/>[[Benito Carbone]] 85'|stadium = [[Hindmarsh Stadium]]<br />'''Attendance:''' 15,119<br />'''Referee:''' [[Mark Shield]] ([[Football Federation Australia|Australia]])}}

A poor match from Adelaide allowed Sydney FC to move four points clear of them on the A-League ladder. Sydney FC started the match well with [[Alex Brosque]] and [[Benito Carbone]] playing good football in and around the box. Travis Dodd had the first real chance of the game in a one-on-one with [[Clint Bolton]] but the speedy United winger took a bad touch allowing Bolton to make an easy save. In the 38th minute, Carbone was allowed too much time and space and he lobbed a perfect ball over to Zadkovich who tapped the ball past Bajic. United returned from the half time interval as the better team and they only had to wait eight minutes before Young Socceroo [[Nathan Burns]] scored his first [[A-League]] goal. Dodd made all the hard work go to waste however, when three minutes later he scored an own goal attempting to clear a ball which posed no danger. Carbone set up the third with a backheel which broke down the entire defence allowing substitute Petrovski to make the score 3-1. Then Carbone finally scored a goal for himself. He broke free on the right hand side and the flag stayed down allowing him to calmly slot the ball past Bajic. 4-1 to Sydney FC. [[Jason Spagnuolo]] and [[Carl Veart]] missed two easy chances to make the scoreline less embarrassing and Adelaide's defence knows it must improve with the dangerous [[Damian Mori]] coming to Adelaide next Friday night.

====Round 7====
----
{{footballbox | date=[[October 6]], [[2006]]<br/ >19:30
|team1 = [[Image:AUFCsmall.jpg|25px]] {{AL-AU}} |score =  3&ndash;1|report= [http://www.a-league.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=5394&pageid=1 (Report)] <br /> [http://www.a-league.com.au/scoreboard/0000430099/scoreboard.html (Summary)] |team2 = {{AL-CCM}} [[Image:Central Coast FC.gif|25px]]

A much improved performance from United after the 4-1 drubbing at home by [[Sydney FC]]. The Mariners started as the better side but United scored the opener as [[Jason Spagnuolo]] made the most of a defensive error by Damian Mori to provide the cross from which [[Carl Veart]] headed home from close range. Central Coast hit back a quarter of an hour later as Australian football legend and Socceroos all-time top scorer [[Damian Mori]] received a good ball, beat [[Angelo Costanzo|Ang Costanzo]] for pace and rounded 'keeper [[Robert Bajic|Robbie Bajic]] before celebrating his return to [[Hindmarsh Stadium]] in front of 10,000 booing Reds supporters. Adelaide came out of the dressing rooms after the half time break and threw absolutely everything at CCM with [[Matthew Kemp]] and [[Bobby Petta]] having almost identical chances saved by Vukovic. Greg Owens and Nathan Burns also missed crucial opportunities. Petta provided a good corner and tall centre back Kristian Rees headed home for his first goal of the season. [[Noel Spencer]] missed the Mariners' best chance of the half and United wrapped the game up with Carl Veart setting up a free [[Nathan Burns]] who ran the length of one half and slotted the ball past Vukovic.

====Round 8====
----
{{footballbox | date=[[October 15]], [[2006]]<br/ >17:00
|team1 = [[Image:MelbVictory-logo.svg|25px]] {{AL-MV}} |score = 0&ndash;1|report =[http://www.a-league.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=5500&pageid=1 (Report)]<br/>[http://www.a-league.com.au/scoreboard/0000430105/scoreboard.html (Summary)] |team2 = {{AL-AU}} [[Image:AUFCsmall.jpg|25px]]
|goals1 = |goals2 = [[Greg Owens]] 83'|stadium = [[Telstra Dome]]<br />'''Attendance:''' 32,368<br />'''Referee:''' [[Matthew Breeze]] ([[Football Federation Australia|Australia]])}}

One of the matches of the season as the Melbourne Victory attempted to maintain a 100% record against an Adelaide side nearing the top of their game. The match got off to a fiery start as [[Ross Aloisi]] and [[Grant Brebner]] received yellow cards in the opening minute. The Victory had the better of the chances during the match, yet it was the Reds who came away with the 3 points as a counter-attacking move saw [[Greg Owens]] run free and slot the ball past 'keeper [[Michael Theoklitos|Theoklitos]]. The main talking point however, was an altercation between Victory captain [[Kevin Muscat]] and Adelaide coach [[John Kosmina]]. The ball had gone out of play for a Melbourne throw-in and with his side 0&ndash;1 down, Muscat wanted to retrieve the ball quickly. The ball had gone under Kosmina's chair and as the Reds manager was picking it up, Muscat sent the Kossie sprawling to the turf. Kosmina then got up and grabbed Muscat by the throat. Kosmina was sent to the stands while Muscat received a booking. Kosmina was given a 6 week suspension, with two suspended. The Victory still sit atop the [[A-League]] ladder while United are third.

====Round 9====

{{footballbox | date=[[October 22]], [[2006]]<br/ >19:30

An impressive attacking performance as Adelaide go outright second on the [[A-League]] ladder. Rising stars [[Nathan Burns]] and [[Bruce Djite]] showed that they can do whatever [[Fernando Rech|Fernando]] and [[Qu Shengqing|Qu]] can do. [[Jason Spagnuolo]] more assists setting up goals for Burns and Petta. However, the defensive effort wasn't as good as the Hindmarsh crowd has come to expect with poor defending giving [[Noah Hickey]] the Knights second of the season and [[Adam van Dommele]] scoring an embarrassing own goal to make matters worse. Dodd sealed the win with a late header which beat Milosevic.

====Round 10====
----
{{footballbox | date=[[October 27]], [[2006]]<br/ >19:30
|team1 = [[Image:Newcastle United Jets.jpg|25px]]  {{AL-NJ}} |score =  2-1|report=[http://www.a-league.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=5700 (Report)] <br /> [http://www.a-league.com.au/scoreboard/0000430112/scoreboard.html (Summary)] |team2 = {{AL-AU}} [[Image:AUFCsmall.jpg|25px]]

Another exciting match that beared similarities to the Round 5 match against the Roar. Newcastle dominated possession but Adelaide continued to defend well. Bajic made six saves and defenders scrambled to cover him even when he was beaten. As in round five, Adelaide had to absorb pressure, the Jets had 24 shots at goal. Unlike the Queenslanders however, Newcastle punished Adelaide for it's lapses in defence. At 1-1, 88 minutes into the match, [[Carl Veart]] had a chance to steal the game and cement second place on the ladder with his third spot kick of the night. The Jets had conceded two penalties with the first having to be retaken. Veart blasted the would-be match sealer over the bar and a minute later the Jets scored the winner instead.

Adelaide born Mimi Saric opened the scoring early in the first half due to some ball watching from the Adelaide defense but Carl Veart equalised literally straight after Saric scored after Spagnuolo was being held in the box. 8 minutes later Greg Owens scored a great goal after Travis Dodd burned down the right win and cross along to Veart, who missed the ball only for Greg Owens to place a perfect shot that creeped into the goal. Greg Owens missed another chance to put his side ahead but headed wide from 3 yards. On half time Perth were awarded a dubious penalty after a player was pushed in the Perth box. Bobby scored from the spot and the teams were equal at half time. Early in the second half Matty Kemp scored a freak goal from a narrow angle where he jumped and kicked the ball over the keepers head only for it to sneak under the crossbar and win the game.

A deserved win for Adelaide who dominated. Adelaide dominated play despite early shots from Queensland and the Roar hardly tested Bajic until the end of the second half. Travis Dodds goal came from a beautiful long pass from Greg Owens deep in the midfield to Carl Veart who shrugged off his defender and delivered a nice ball across the face of goal to give Travis the easiest of goals.

Muscat scored from the spot early in the half after Bajic needlessly kicked Fred in the gut while retrieving the ball. Fernando scored a header from a beautiful cross from Matthew Kemp to equalise and Adelaide looked to score again. Half time came at the wrong time for AUFC as they were gaining momentum. The game was 50/50 after half time until the aging Adelaide Midfield began to tire and in the 61st minute Allsopp scored due and in the 86th minute Fred scored after his 1v1 shot was blocked beautifully by Beltrame, but Fred scored on the rebound.

Gao Leilei scored in the 16th minute after Richie Alagich started to wander and entered the 6 yard box without any pressure and slotted the ball past Beltrames near post. Adelaide had chances and Spagnuolo hit the bar but in the 71st minute Greg Owens passed to Travis Dodd in the midfield and Travis out dribbled the defense to deliver a perfect ball back to Greg Owens whose shot hit the ball then went in off the keeper.

One of the best ever games of Hindmarsh and Romarios departure was a great game. In the 15th minute the young master Spagnuolo skinned two defenders, feinted past Eagleton to deliver a shot at goal that Covic parried away. Luckily Romario was Johnny-on-the-spot and dispaced the rebound. Mark Bridge scored a beautiful goal in the 59th minute and straight after kick off, Alagich booted the ball down the Spagnuolo who passed it to Fernando, who miss hit the ball and wrongfooted Covic to deliver a very lucky goal. Matt Thompson scored one of the best goals of the season after skinning Rees and powering the ball into the top of the net. This wasn't enough to stop AUFC as soon after Owens received the ball from Romario on the edge of the box, wrong footed his marker and shot a ball that subtly curved into the top right hand corner.

This match was Diegos debut and he impressed very much so. The only real chance or highlight in the game was the goal. Travis Dodd was brought down on the edge of the box and Petta took the free kick. Petta crossed to an unmarked Diego who headed the ball into Fernandos chest and the ball went through Boltons legs, although Fernando didn't know too much about it. Soon after Beltrame denied Coricas header with a great diving save and Adelaide took second place.

Adelaide scored in the 10th minute thanks to some brilliant wingplay from former Celtic star Bobby Petta who crossed the ball across the goal to Burns who scored a very easy tap in. After half time Kwasnik missed a penalty after Kemp handballed in the box and straight after Burns scored his second of the night with a cheeky feint to trick the keeper. Soon after Burns made his own goal after passing to Djite who passed to Petta, who rolled the ball through the Mariners defense to give Burnsy a relatively easy goal. Pondeljaks goal came after a messed up clearance by Beltrame. Beltrame kicked it straight to Pondeljak who showed some killer instinct and skill by perfectly placing it above Bells head and ending his hope for his clean sheet. Djite hit the bar from a stunning volley from distance but failed to score. This game cemented Adelaides second place finish.
