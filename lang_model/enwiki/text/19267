:''For the album based on the episode see [[Chef Aid: The South Park Album]]''

"'''Chef Aid'''" is the 27th episode of [[Comedy Central]]'s [[animated television series|animated series]] ''[[South Park]]''. It originally aired on October 7, 1998. Guest stars included [[Joe Strummer]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Ween]], [[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[Elton John]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Rick James]], and [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]].
==Plot synopsis==
[[Chef (South Park character)|Chef]] discovers that [[Alanis Morissette]]'s (fictional) hit song "Stinky Britches" is a song that he wrote many years ago, before abandoning his musical aspirations. He contacts a "major [[record company]]" executive, seeking only to have his name credited as the composer of "Stinky Britches." Chef's claim is substantiated by a twenty-year-old recording of Chef performing the song. The record company refuses, and furthermore hires [[Johnnie Cochran]], who files a [[lawsuit]] against him for [[harassment]]. Cochran employs the "[[Chewbacca defense]]", resulting in a win for the record company and [[damages]] to be paid by the defense, so Chef now has 24 hours to come up with the money or face four years of incarceration. However, instead of allowing all his stuff to be taken by the greedy record company executive, Chef decides to raise all the money by temporarily becoming a prostitute and sleeping with all the women in town. Instead of paying the executive, he will pay Johnnie Cochran the money so this time ''he'' can sue the record company.

Meanwhile, [[Mr. Garrison]] witnesses many strange attempts on Mr. Twig's life; he finds him boiling in a pot of water, and later snapped in half. The evidence begins to point to Mr. Hat as the culprit, culminating in a showdown between Mr. Garrison and Mr. Hat which lands the former in jail.

The boys try to help Chef by rounding up various musicians whose careers have been boosted by Chef's advice to hold a [[benefit concert]]. The record company executive [[sabotage]]s the concert, but the outpouring of support for Chef touches Johnnie Cochran, whose heart "[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!|grew three sizes that day]]." Cochran switches sides for free and successfully defends Chef,  in a new trial, although he uses the Chewbacca Defense again (resulting in an explosion of one juror's head), ending with Chef finally getting his name on the album. Mr. Garrison and Mr. Hat eventually make up their differences and get back together.

==Album release==
{{main|Chef Aid: The South Park Album}}
An album was released based on the episode. It featured 21 songs, some being extended and unaired songs from this episode and previous episodes in the series, others being completely original to the album. Many notable artists from all different genres made [[cameo appearance]]s on the album.

==Chewbacca defense==
{{main|Chewbacca defense}}

The [[Chewbacca]] defense is a fictional legal strategy used in ''Chef Aid''. It is a form of [[Ignoratio elenchi|Red Herring]] argument, used to deliberately confuse the [[jury]].  The concept [[satire|satirized]] attorney [[Johnnie Cochran]]'s [[closing argument]] defending [[O. J. Simpson]] in his [[O. J. Simpson murder case|murder trial]]. In court, Cochran resorts to his "famous" Chewbacca defense, which he "used during the Simpson trial", according to [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]. It was a [[parody]] of Johnnie Cochran's closing arguments in the [[O. J. Simpson murder case]] where he stated to the jury: "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit,"
in reference to an earlier point in the trial when prosecutor [[Christopher Darden]] asked Mr. Simpson to try on a bloody glove found at the murder scene, and Mr. Simpson could not put it on because it did not fit his hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/resources/video.almanac/1995/index3.html#simpson.trial|title=CNN Interactive: Video Almanac - 1995}}</ref>

Cochran's defense is successful and the jury finds Chef guilty of "harassing a major record label" and sets his punishment as either a two million dollar fine to be paid within twenty-four hours or, failing that, four years in prison (the judge initially sentences him to eight million years).

Ultimately a "Chef Aid" [[benefit concert]] is organized to raise money for Chef to hire Johnnie Cochran for his own lawsuit against the record company. At the concert Johnnie Cochran experiences a change of heart and offers to represent Chef ''[[pro bono]].'' He again successfully uses the Chewbacca defense, this time to defeat the record company and make them acknowledge Chef's authorship of their song. In the second use of the Chewbacca defense, he ends by taking out a [[monkey]] puppet and shouting "Here, look at the monkey. Look at the silly monkey!" causing a juror's head to explode.

=== Usage ===
The ''[[Associated Press]]'' obituary for Cochran mentioned the Chewbacca defense parody as one of the ways in which the attorney had entered [[popular culture|pop culture]].<ref>{{cite news

Criminologist Dr. Thomas O'Connor says that when DNA evidence shows "inclusion", that is, does not exonerate a client by exclusion from the DNA sample provided, "About the only thing you can do is attack the lab for its (lack of) quality assurance and proficiency testing, or use a 'Chewbacca defense' <U+2026>and try to razzle-dazzle the jury about how complex and complicated the other side's evidence or probability estimates are."<ref>{{cite web

Kenneally also presents methods that can be used to rebut a Chewbacca defense.<ref>{{cite web

The term has also seen use in political commentary; [[Ellis Weiner]] wrote in ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' that [[Dinesh D'Souza]] was using the Chewbacca defense in criticism of new [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Nancy Pelosi]], defining it as when "someone asserts his claim by saying something so patently nonsensical that the listener's brain shuts down completely."<ref>{{cite news
