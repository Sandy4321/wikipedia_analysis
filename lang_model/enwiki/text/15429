The '''Spanish Banks''' are a series of beaches in the city of [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]], located along the shores of [[English Bay (Vancouver)|English Bay]] in the [[West Point Grey]] neighbourhood. The Spanish Banks are located between [[Locarno Beach]] to the east and the grounds of the [[University of British Columbia]] to the west. 

==About Spanish Bank beach==

Spanish Banks were named for the first European explorers of the Strait of Georgia, [[Juan Carrasco (explorer)|Juan Carrasco]] and [[Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Narv<U+00E1>ez]], who sited Point Grey in 1791.

Although technically just one bank, the Spanish Bank beaches are modestly divided into three sections: Spanish Bank East, Spanish Bank Extension, and Spanish Bank West. These beaches are backed by grassy fields, which make them popular for walks, family gatherings, picnics, [[soccer]] and [[volleyball]] games.  

The Spanish banks are best known for their strikingly [[low tide|low tides]], which are most prominent at Spanish Banks West. While swimming is possible at Spanish Banks East, [[skimboarding]] and [[kitesurfing]] are therefore more popular activities at Spanish Banks West.

==The beaches==
===Spanish Bank East===

Spanish Bank East is situated west of Tolmie Street on Northwest Marine Drive. The beach is equipped with eight sand [[volleyball]] courts that operate on a first-come-first-serve basis. There are lifeguards on site (from Victoria Day to Labour Day), and a [[concession stand]].  A popular activity on Spanish Banks East is skimboarding in the many shallow pools and rad waves.

===Spanish Bank Extension===

Spanish Bank Extension can be found west of Spanish Bank West on Northwest Marine Drive. There are lifeguards on site (from Victoria Day to Labour Day), but there are no concession stands or volleyball courts.

===Spanish Bank West===

Spanish Bank West is located west of Spanish Bank East on Northwest Marine Drive. Like Spanish Bank East, this beach has eight volleyball courts, life guards on site (from [[Victoria Day]] to [[Labor Day|Labour Day]]) and a concession stand. However, this beach is designated as a quiet beach so no amplified music is permitted.
