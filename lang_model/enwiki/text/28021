The episode, set during the last scene of the previous episode "[[Last of the Time Lords]]", depicts a humorous encounter between the Doctor's [[Fifth Doctor|fifth]] and [[Tenth Doctor|tenth]] incarnations, played by Davison and Tennant respectively. "Time Crash" was universally praised by critics who reviewed the episode, and was a ratings success; it was the most-viewed show of the night, and briefly the most-viewed episode of ''Doctor Who'' since 2005, with 11 million viewers.<ref name="TCON"/>

== Synopsis ==
The episode takes place concurrently with the final scene of "[[Last of the Time Lords]]".{{ref|a|[a]}} After the [[Tenth Doctor]] ([[David Tennant]]) parts ways with [[Martha Jones|Martha]] ([[Freema Agyeman]]), the [[TARDIS]] encounters a problem, leading the Doctor to encounter his [[fifth Doctor|fifth incarnation]] ([[Peter Davison]]). The Tenth Doctor is overjoyed to meet his past self, but the Fifth Doctor is annoyed; he believes his counterpart to be a fan.

The Doctors realise their TARDISes have merged because the Tenth Doctor forgot to raise his shields. The collision created a [[supermassive black hole]], which the Tenth Doctor counters by creating a [[supernova]]. An impressed Fifth Doctor realises that he remembered the solution from watching the Tenth performing it. Before the Fifth Doctor departs, the Tenth Doctor leaves him a heartfelt message: {{blockquote|You know, I loved being you. Back when I first started, at the very beginning, I was always trying to be old and grumpy and important<U+2014>like you do, when you're young. And then I was you, and it was all dashing about and playing cricket and my voice going all squeaky when I shouted. I still do that, the voice thing, I got that from ''you''. Oh, and the trainers. And... ''[putting his glasses on]'' snap! You know what, Doctor? You were ''my'' Doctor.|[[Tenth Doctor]]|"[[Time Crash]]" by [[Steven Moffat]], transcribed by Andrew Pixley of ''Doctor Who Magazine''<ref name="companion">{{cite journal|last=Pixley|first=Andrew|date=2008-08-14|title=Time Crash|journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]|publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells]]|volume=The Doctor Who Companion: Series 4|issue=Special Edition 20|pages=6-9|accessdate=2008-08-16}}</ref>}}

After the Tenth Doctor says goodbye, the Fifth Doctor reminds him to raise the TARDIS' shields. Seconds after, the ''Titanic'' collides with the TARDIS, leading the narrative into "[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]".

== Production ==
The episode was first conceived by executive producers [[Julie Gardner]] and [[Russell T Davies]], who decided to air an interstitial scene for [[Children in Need]] 2007. Gardner asked [[Steven Moffat]] to write the special, with the stipulations the scene could be shot one day and one set, and require no [[computer generated imagery|CGI]] effects. [[David Tennant]] suggested that the episode would feature two Doctors; he suggested his favourite Doctor<U+2014>the [[Fifth Doctor]] portrayed by [[Peter Davison]]<U+2014>would meet his incarnation. Davison was approached in July 2007, who accepted the role to impress his children.<ref name="companion" />

Moffat's script started by repeating Martha's departure. The script indicated that "this time, we stay with the Doctor. As before ... the Doctor takes a moment, then slam the controls,"<ref name="companion" /> and described the Fith Doctor as having a "frock coat, cricket jersey, and a stick of celery on his lapel". Moffat included several references to Fifth Doctor stories in his script: the Tenth Doctor commented about the Fifth Doctor's attire and his disuse of the sonic screwdriver; and near the end of the episode, he references [[Tegan Jovanka]], [[Nyssa]], the [[Cybermen]] stories ''[[Earthshock]]'' and ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', the [[Mara (Doctor Who)|Mara]] serials ''[[Kinda]]'' and ''[[Snakedance]]'', the [[Time Lords]]' "funny hats" from ''[[Arc of Infinity]]'', and the various [[Anthony Ainley|Ainley]] [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]] stories during Davison's tenure.<ref name="companion" />

"Time Crash" was filmed at the show's studios in [[Upper Boat]], [[Cardiff]], as part of the fourth recording block of the [[Doctor Who (series 4)|fourth series]] (which included "[[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|Partners in Crime]]") on [[7 October]] [[2007]]. [[Graeme Harper]], director of Davison's final serial ''[[The Caves of Androzani]]'', directed the episode.<ref name="companion" /><ref name="rt01">{{cite journal|last=Griffiths|first=Nick|title=A Doctor calls|journal=[[Radio Times]]|volume=335|issue=4361|date=[[November 10]]&ndash;[[November 16|13]] 2007|pages=p. 18}}</ref> To replicate the Fifth Doctor's attire, the production team borrowed items from the ''Doctor Who'' exhibition in [[Blackpool]] and knitted a new cricket jumper to reflect the style worn from ''[[Castrovalva]]'' to ''[[Warriors of the Deep]]''.<ref name="companion" /> The episode was officially announced by the BBC on [[October 21]].<ref name="bbc announcement"/>

The episode was positively reviewed by critics. Martin Conaghan of [[TV Squad]] expressed the belief that the episode was "the highlight of the evening". He mainly complemented Moffat for his writing; he said that Moffat "has a knack for clever paradox-style stories, and managed to capture a fantastic little snippet of emotion, harking back to the early days of Doctor Who," specifically praising the farewell scene.<ref name="tv squad">{{cite web|last=Conaghan|first=Martin|title=Doctor Who: Time Crash|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/11/17/doctor-who-time-crash/|publisher=[[TV Squad]]|date=[[2007-11-17]]|accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref> Dek Hogan of [[Digital Spy]] mirrored Conaghan's beliefs; he called Moffat's script "witty" and hoped that Davison would return to film a full-length episode.<ref name="digital spy review">{{cite web|last=Hogan|first=Dek|title=I love the sound of breaking glass|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a80114/i-love-the-sound-of-breaking-glass.html|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=[[2007-11-19]]|accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref> Alasdair Stuart of Firefox News complemented Moffat for his continuing writing quality. He specifically praised Davison's performance and the Tenth Doctor's "you were ''my'' Doctor" monologue; he thought the latter was "a lovely way of acknowledging the show's past". He closed his review by calling the episode "''Doctor Who'' at its very best".<ref name="firefox">{{cite web|last=Stuart|first=Alasdair|title=Review-Doctor Who - 'Timecrash'|url=http://firefox.org/news/articles/888/1/Review-Doctor-Who---039Timecrash039/Page1.html|publisher=Firefox News|date=[[2007-11-17]]|accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref>
