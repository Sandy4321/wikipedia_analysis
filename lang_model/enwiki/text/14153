The original Aztecs lineup split from Thorpe at the beginning of 1965 over a financial dispute, so he created another set,<ref name="McF"/> with [[Johnny Dick (musician)|Johnny Dick]] (drums), Mike Downes (rhythm guitar, vocals), Colin Risby (lead guitar, vocals), Jimmy Taylor ([[piano]]), [[Teddy Toi]] (bass guitar), [[Tony Buchanan]] ([[saxophone]]) and [[Rocky Thomas]] ([[brass (instrument)|brass]]).<ref name="McF"/><ref name="ARDb"/> This lineup achieved further success with [[pop music|pop]] ballads such as  "I Told the Brook", "Twilight Time" and "Love Letters".<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Howl"/> On 27 March 1966, Sydney TV station [[Seven Network|ATN-7]] debuted a music show, ''It's All Happening!'', hosted by Thorpe with the Aztecs as the house band.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Howl"/><ref name="1001Aus"/> Each one-hour episode featured both Australian and international musical guests.
