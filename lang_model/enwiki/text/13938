'''Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles''', (''National Institute for Blind Children'' or ''Royal Institution for Blind Youth''), in [[Paris]], was the first [[special school]] for blind students in the world, and served as a model for many subsequent schools for blind students.

==History==
The INJA was created in [[1784]] by [[Valentin Ha<U+00FC>y]]. 

It was not until the late 18th century that society began to take an interest in the education of the blind. Until that time they were considered mostly uneducable and untrainable. One of the major figures in the movement to educate the blind was [[S<U+00E9>bastien Guilli<U+00E9>]]. He established the first [[ophthalmology|ophthalmological]] clinic in France and became director of the school in Paris. 

[[Louis Braille]], the inventor of the [[braille]] system, attended the school in 1819 and later taught there.

==Organ class==
The first organ class for blind students was established at the institute in 1826 and by 1833 no less than 14 blind students held organist positions in the churches of Paris. The institute continued to produce large number of successful organist such as [[Andr<U+00E9> Marchal]], [[Jean Langlais]] and [[Gaston Litaize]].<ref>Jean Langlais: The Man and his Music, Ann Labounsky 2000, pages 30-47</ref>

==Effect on other schools==
[[Perkins School for the Blind]], attended by the famed American [[deafblind]] woman [[Helen Keller]], was founded after a visit to the INJA.
