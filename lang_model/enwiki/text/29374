"'''Don't Panic'''" is a song written and recorded by British [[alternative rock]] band [[Coldplay]]. Originally titled "Panic", the earliest known version of the song existed in 1998, performed live during the band's first gig in the same year. It had a different melody, and was included in the band's second [[extended play|EP]], ''[[The Blue Room (EP)|The Blue Room]]''. The track was reproduced by Coldplay and British producer [[Ken Nelson (British record producer)|Ken Nelson]] for the band's debut studio album, ''[[Parachutes]]''.

Following their successful releases in 2000, Coldplay and their record label [[Parlophone]] thought there was enough exposure of the album in the United Kingdom. Thus, the decision of releasing a fourth single would be for regions that had not been overdosed by the hit singles "[[Yellow (song)|Yellow]]" and "[[Trouble (Coldplay song)|Trouble]]". They settled on "Don't Panic", which at the time was an audience favorite. The single was released in some European regions, and the United Kingdom only received a promo edition. The critical reception of the song was generally positive.

On 19 July 2011, the song was played as a wake-up call to [[STS-135]] [[Space Shuttle]] Atlantis Pilot [[Doug Hurley]] as a tribute from his wife and family, marking the last ever wake-up call for a crew visiting the [[International Space Station]] from the Space Shuttle fleet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmDDqOYk5oI |title=Youtube: Flight Day 12 Wake Up Song and Greeting STS-135 &#124;}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/135_wakeup.html |title=NASA: STS-135 Wakeup &#124;}}</ref>

== Origins and production ==
"Don't Panic" came into existence while Coldplay was still in its infancy. In the time, the band had written 10 songs including an early version of "Don't Panic", and used it in recruiting the band's drummer.<ref name="QState">{{cite journal|title=The State of Coldplay|month=August|year=2002|work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]}}</ref> It was originally called "Panic",<ref>{{cite web|first=Matt|last=Diehl|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_7_33/ai_105735865|title=Matt Diehl talks to the rest of the band|accessdate=2008-09-08|month=August|year=2003|publisher=BNET ([[Internet Archive]])|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071222184651/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_7_33/ai_105735865 |archivedate = December 22, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> and was one of six songs played at Coldplay's first gig in 1998 at Camden's Laurel Tree.<ref name="ColdplayDiscog">{{cite web|url=http://www.coldplay.com/html/discodetail.shtml?item=6|title=Coldplay: Discography|publisher=Coldplay.com|accessdate=2008-10-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030527212226/http://www.coldplay.com/html/discodetail.shtml?item=6 |archivedate = May 27, 2003}}</ref> This version has a different melody, and the lyrics are an account of a "slightly disastrous evening Chris had spent entertaining a young lady called Alice Hill".<ref name="ColdplayDiscog" /> Eventually, the title became "Don't Panic."

The original version of "Don't Panic" was recorded in 1999, different from the version featured in ''Parachutes''. First, vocalist [[Chris Martin]] plays the piano during the [[Song structure (popular music)#Bridge|bridge]]. As well, there is a feedback-[[distortion|distorted]] introduction. This version was included in ''[[The Blue Room (EP)|The Blue Room]]'' [[extended play|EP]], released in October 1999.<ref>{{cite album-notes|title=The Blue Room|first=Coldplay|year=1999|month=October|publisher=[[EMI]]|format=EP|accessdate=2008-10-23}}</ref>

For Coldplay's first [[studio album]] ''Parachutes'', British record producer [[Ken Nelson (British record producer)|Ken Nelson]] re-produced "Don't Panic". The track was recorded live, like many other tracks featured in the album. Guitarist [[Jonny Buckland]] recorded twice his [[overdubbing|overdubbed]] guitars, and used parts of the two during the [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]]. The band subtly used the acoustic guitar, drums and bass, and also a [[pump organ]].<ref name="Inglis">{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct00/articles/ken.htm|title=Recording Coldplay's Parachutes|last=Inglis|first=Sam|date=October 2000|work=SOS|accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref> The song was recorded in Rockfield Studios, Wales and Parr Street Studio, [[Liverpool]].<ref name="ColdplayDiscog" />

"Don't Panic" is the opening track to ''Parachutes''. A guitar-based song, it begins with a strummed electric guitar, followed with more guitar lines, then the vocals.<ref name="Roach47">Roach, p. 47</ref> A review claims that Coldplay's [[indie rock]] inclination is obvious in the song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=A3h9yxdyb2ola|title=Parachutes: Coldplay|last=Wilson|first=MacKenzie|work=Allmusic|publisher=Macrovision Company|accessdate=2008-09-24}} {{Dead link|date=January 2011|bot=CactusBot}}</ref>

Originally, the band planned to release "Don't Panic" as ''Parachutes''{{'}} fourth [[single (music)|single]]. However, it was abandoned after they deemed three singles were enough for an album.<ref name="Roach54">Roach, p. 54</ref> Following the successful single releases of the album in 2000, the band thought that ''Parachutes'' had gained enough exposure in significant regions in the United Kingdom. When they decided to release a fourth single, it would be for countries yet not "overdosed" by the hit singles "[[Yellow (song)|Yellow]]" and "[[Trouble (Coldplay song)|Trouble]]". Coldplay and their record label, [[Parlophone]], settled on "Don't Panic", which at the time was an audience favorite. The single was eventually released on 19 March 2001 in some European regions.<ref name="ColdplayDiscog"/> The single is accompanied by the live tracks "[[You Only Live Twice (soundtrack)|You Only Live Twice]]", a theme song for the [[James Bond]] [[You Only Live Twice (film)|film of the same name]], and "Bigger Stronger", a song taken from [[Safety (EP)|the band's first EP release]]; these live tracks were recorded during their performance at the [[Rockefeller Music Hall]] in Norway.<ref name="ColdplayDiscog"/> "Don't Panic" appeared on the UK compilation album ''[[Now That's What I Call Music! 48 (UK series)|Now That's What I Call Music! 48]]''.<ref>{{cite album-notes|title=Now That's What I Call Music! 48|first=Various artists|year=1999|month=April|publisher=EMI|format=Compilation album}}</ref>

Like their others songs, Coldplay has refused several offers to use "Don't Panic" for promotional tools. In 2004, the band rejected a multi-million [[Euro]] offer from [[Diet Coke]] and [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]] to use "Don't Panic" and "[[Trouble (Coldplay song)|Trouble]]", another song featured in the album. The band asked then-manager [[Phil Harvey (manager)|Phil Harvey]] to not refer them to such offers because "a discussion might lead to compromise".<ref name="QState"/>

Despite this, the song has been used in many promotional tools and featured in several films and television series.<!--The song received persistent exposure in Australia for over a year when it was used by Australia's [[Network Ten]] in a series of promotional ads that ran before and after most shows, featuring its programming and personalities.--> In 2002, the song was featured in the [[comedy-drama film]] ''[[Igby Goes Down]]'',<ref name="MillerIgby">{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/a_kiss_after_supper/igby-goes-down.htm|title=A Kiss After Supper: Igby Goes Down|last=Drew|first=Miller|date=2005-07-07|publisher=Stylus Magazine|accessdate=2008-11-27}}</ref> and later appeared on the film's [[soundtrack album]], released on February 25, 2003 by [[Spun Records]]. Also in 2003, the song was also featured on Coldplay's [[live album]] ''[[Live 2003]]''.<ref name="live 2003" /> In 2004, it was on the [[romantic comedy]] film ''[[Garden State (film)|Garden State]]''; director [[Zach Braff]] handpicked songs, including "Don't Panic", for the film's [[Grammy Award]]-winning [[compilation album]], ''Garden State: Music From The Motion Picture''.<ref name="MillerIgby"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/533/533446p1.html|title=Garden State Soundtrack|date=2004-07-26|work=IGN|accessdate=2008-11-27}}</ref> The song was also featured on the debut episode of the [[FX (TV network)|FX]] television series ''[[Rescue Me (U.S. TV series)|Rescue Me]]'' as well as the pilot episode of the short-lived show ''[[Odyssey 5]]''.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Guts|series=Rescue Me|credits=[[Peter Tolan]] and [[Denis Leary]]|network=[[FX Networks|FX]]|airdate=2004-07-21|season=1|number=1|minutes=45}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title=The Shatterer|series=Odyssey 5|network=[[Showtime (TV network)|]]|airdate=2002-06-28|season=1|seriesno=101|minutes=44}}</ref> Additionally, the song was featured in episode nine of the first series on the British TV series ''[[Sugar Rush (TV series)|Sugar Rush]]'' in 2005.<ref>{{cite episode|title=|series=Sugar Rush|credits=[[Olivia Hallinan]]|network=[[Channel 4]]|airdate=2005}}</ref>

During the band's 2003 [[A Rush of Blood to the Head Tour]], "Don't Panic" contained an entirely different introduction. In addition, Martin played the electric guitar and Buckland in [[harmonica]] solo during the bridge.<ref name="live 2003">{{cite video|date=2003|title=Live 2003|medium=DVD|publisher=Capitol Records and Parlophone}}</ref> He regularly threw the harmonica into the crowd after the solo. In 2001, a [[dance music|dance]] cover version of "Don't Panic" was released by Logo featuring Dawn Joseph.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Panic-Logo-Down-Joseph/dp/B00005RIHH |title=Amazon.com: Don't Panic: Logo &amp; Down Joseph: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-09}}</ref>

=== Critical reviews ===
Upon release, critics gave the song generally positive reviews. MacKenzie Wilson, in his review from [[Allmusic]], notes, "Coldplay's indie rock inclinations are also obvious, especially on songs such as 'Don't Panic' and 'Shiver'."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=A3h9yxdyb2ola|title=Parachutes - Overview|last=Wilson|first=MacKenzie|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=Macrovision Company|accessdate=2008-10-07}} {{Dead link|date=January 2011|bot=CactusBot}}</ref> In the [[Pitchfork Media]] review, Spencer Owen writes, "This subdued, dreamy opener contains Martin's falsetto chorus of 'We live in a beautiful world,' which seems to sum up the overall sentiment of the record."<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/16251-coldplay-parachutes|title=Parachutes|last=Owen|first=Spencer|date=1999-12-31|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|accessdate=2008-10-07|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080922173254/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/16251-coldplay-parachutes <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=2008-09-22}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] alleged that, along with "[[Yellow (Coldplay song)|Yellow]]", the song was one of only two good ones on all of ''Parachutes''. Critic Adrian Denning, in his review of the album, compliments, "Both the vocals and guitar are utterly beautiful. It's a song to take solace from, draw comfort from, be quietly awed by."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adriandenning.co.uk/coldplay.html|title=Album reviews - Parachutes|last=Denning|first=Adrian|year=2000|publisher=adriandenning.co.uk|accessdate=2008-10-07}}</ref> David DeVoe of Hybridmagazine.com wrote: "It is a wonderful song that echoes the promise of what is to come on the rest of the record. 'Don<U+2019>t Panic' is filled with excellent guitar tones and a nice grooving back beat, and I love the way the song ends."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hybridmagazine.com/reviews/0101/coldplay.shtml|title=Coldplay - Parachutes|last=DeVoe|first=David|publisher=Hybridmagazine.com|accessdate=2008-10-07}}</ref>

== Music video ==
The music video for "Don't Panic" was directed by Tim Hope. The video starts off with an animated diagram of the [[water cycle]], then portrays the band as two-dimensional paper cutouts doing household chores, when suddenly disaster strikes the earth in the forms of [[flood]]s, [[volcano]]es and electric shocks. Like Coldplay's earlier music videos, "Don't Panic" also features the yellow globe on the cover of ''Parachutes''.<ref>{{cite video |people=Pope, Tim - Director|date=2001|title=Don't Panic|medium=Music video|publisher=EMI|location=England}}</ref>
