'''''Lagidium ahuacaense''''' is a [[rodent]] in the [[mountain viscacha]] genus (''Lagidium'') that occurs in southern [[Ecuador]]. First observed in 2005 and formally described in 2009, it occurs more than 500&nbsp;km (300&nbsp;mi) north of the nearest previously known population of mountain viscachas in central Peru. It is a medium-sized species with gray-brown upperparts and creamy white underparts. The tail is long and is various shades of brown above and dark brown below. The skull is long, with a wide rostrum (front part) and narrow [[interorbital region]] (between the eyes). The sides of the [[mesopterygoid fossa]] (the opening behind the back of the [[palate]]) are strongly divergent.

Only a single population is known, found on rocky habitats on [[Cerro El Ahuaca]], an isolated granite mountain in southern Ecuador, and there may be as little as a few dozen individuals. The species is threatened by fires and grazing cattle, and the discoverers recommended that its [[conservation status]] be assessed as "[[Critically Endangered]]".

==Taxonomy==
''Lagidium ahuacaense'' was first observed in July 2005, when the only known population was encountered at [[Cerro El Ahuaca]], Ecuador,<ref name=Wea273>Werner et al., 2006, p.&nbsp;273</ref> over 500&nbsp;km (300&nbsp;mi) north of the northernmost previously known population of [[Lagidium|mountain viscachas]] (''Lagidium'') in central Peru.<ref name=Lea42>Ledesma et al., 2009, p.&nbsp;42</ref> The find was published in a 2006 note by Florian Werner, Karim Ledesma, and Rodrigo Hidalgo, who provisionally identified the population as representing the Peruvian species ''[[Lagidium peruanum]]'', but did not discount the possibility that it might represent a distinct species.<ref name=Wea273/> Three years later, Ledesma, Werner, <U+00C1>ngel Spotorno, and Luis Albuja proceeded to describe the population as a new species, ''Lagidium ahuacaense'', on the basis of [[morphology (anatomy)|morphological]] and [[DNA sequence]] differences.<ref name=Lea41>Ledesma et al., 2009, p.&nbsp;41</ref> The [[specific name]], ''ahuacaense'', refers to Cerro de Ahuaca. They suggested the English [[common name]] of "Ecuadorean mountain viscacha".<ref name=Lea47>Ledesma et al., 2009, p.&nbsp;47</ref>

''Lagidium ahuacaense'' was the fourth species of the [[genus]] ''Lagidium'' to be described, after ''L.&nbsp;peruanum'', ''[[Lagidium viscacia|L.&nbsp;viscacia]]'', and ''[[Lagidium wolffsohni|L.&nbsp;wolffsohni]]'' of the central and southern Andes, although more species may eventually be recognized within ''L.&nbsp;peruanum'' and ''L.&nbsp;viscacia'' and ''L.&nbsp;wolffsohni'' is poorly differentiated from ''L.&nbsp;viscacia''.<ref name=Lea52>Ledesma et al., 2009, p.&nbsp;52</ref> Together with the [[plains viscacha]] (''Lagostomus maximus'') and the [[chinchilla]]s (''Chinchilla''), ''Lagidium'' forms the [[Chinchillidae]] family of [[rodent]]s.<ref name=Lea42/> Within ''Lagidium'', ''L.&nbsp;ahuacaense'' differs by at least 7.9% from all other species in [[DNA sequence]]s of the [[mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] gene. A [[cladistic]] analysis placed the Ecuadorian species as the [[sister group]] to all other ''Lagidium'', but support for this placement was not strong. [[Morphometric]] analysis also confirms that the Ecuadorian population is different from other ''Lagidium'' species.<ref name=Lea45>Ledesma et al., 2009, p.&nbsp;45</ref>

==Description==
[[File:Rodent on a rock in South America-8.jpg|thumb|alt=Somewhat rabbit-like rodent with gray upperparts and brownish underparts and a long, silvery tail, sitting on rock|A [[northern viscacha]] (''Lagidium peruanum''), the species that occurs closest to ''L.&nbsp;ahuacaense'']]
''Lagidium ahuacaense'' is a medium-sized ''Lagidium'' with woolly, gray-brown fur<ref name=Lea49/> and a very long tail.<ref name=Lea45/> There is a black stripe on the middle of the back. The thick, long [[mystacial vibrissae]] (whiskers above the mouth) are mostly dark brown and the few [[superciliary vibrissae]] (above the eyes) are also thick and brown. The ears are covered with dark skin. The underparts are creamy white. The forefeet are brown-furred and much shorter than the hindfeet, which are in covered in part by a mixture of brown and cream hairs and in part by dark brown hairs. The fore- and hindfeet both have four digits, which end in small, curved claws, and three black [[Paw#Common characteristics|pads]].<ref name=Lea49/> The palms and soles are naked.<ref name=Lea47/> The tail is hairy with the hairs on the upper side longer than those below. The upper side is gray-brown at the base, light to medium brown intermixed with cream in the middle, and reddish brown at the tip, and the lower side is dark brown.<ref name=Lea49>Ledesma et al., 2009, p.&nbsp;49</ref> In the single measured specimen, head and body length is 403&nbsp;mm (15.9&nbsp;in), tail length is 400&nbsp;mm (15.8&nbsp;in), hindfoot length is 85&nbsp;mm (3.3&nbsp;in), ear length is 60&nbsp;mm (2.4&nbsp;in), and body mass is 2.03&nbsp;kg (4.5&nbsp;lb).<ref>Ledesma et al., 2009, table&nbsp;1</ref>

The skull is long and compact. The [[premaxilla]]ry bones extend slightly in front of the upper [[incisor]]s and the [[zygomatic arch]]es (cheekbones) are broad. The [[suture (anatomy)|suture]] between the premaxillary and [[frontal bone]]s is more strongly curved than in ''L.&nbsp;peruanum'' and the rostrum (front part of the skull) is wider and the [[interorbital region]] (between the eyes) is narrower than in ''L.&nbsp;viscacia'' and ''L.&nbsp;wolffsohni''.<ref name=Lea49/> The [[incisive foramina]] (openings in the front part of the [[palate]]) are long and narrow. The palate extends back to a point close to the upper third [[molar (tooth)|molar]].<ref name=Lea50>Ledesma et al., 2009, p.&nbsp;50</ref> The sides of the [[mesopterygoid fossa]] (the opening behind the back margin of the palate) are more strongly divergent than in other ''Lagidium''.<ref name=Lea49/> The [[mandible]] (lower jaw) is strong. The [[dental formula]] is {{DentalFormula|upper=1.0.1.3|lower=1.0.1.3|total=20}} (one incisor, one [[premolar]], and three molars on each side of the upper and lower jaws). The incisors are large and white and distinctly grooved. The molars are low-crowned and rootless (continuously growing).<ref name=Lea50>Ledesma et al., 2009, p.&nbsp;50</ref>

==Ecology and conservation status==
''Lagidium ahuacaense'' is known only from Cerro El Ahuaca, a steep granite [[inselberg]] near [[Cariamanga]] in [[Loja Province]], southern Ecuador, where it occurs at an altitude of 1950 to 2480&nbsp;m (6400 to 8140&nbsp;ft), but only near rocky surfaces.<ref name=Lea47/> The vegetation is dominated by the molasses grass (''[[Melinis minutiflora]]'').<ref name=Wea271>Werner et al., 2006, p.&nbsp;271</ref> They eat plants and traces of their feeding are visible on the mountain.<ref name=Wea272>Werner et al., 2006, p.&nbsp;272</ref> Its habitat on Cerro El Ahuaca covers an area of about 120&nbsp;ha (300&nbsp;acre), and the total population there may not contain more than a few dozen individuals.<ref name=Lea53>Ledesma et al., 2009, p.&nbsp;53</ref> Except for some small outcrops close to the Cerro, there is no nearby suitable habitat,<ref>Werner et al., 2006, pp.&nbsp;273<U+2013>274</ref> but more populations may exist elsewhere in southern Ecuador or nearby northern Peru.<ref name=Lea53/>

The species is threatened by fires, used to maintain crop fields in the vicinity, which frequently get out of control and destroy part of the viscacha's habitat on the Cerro, and by competition for food with grazing cattle. However, the species is unknown to the local people and is not hunted.<ref name=Wea273/> In view of its small range and population, Ledesma and colleagues recommended that the species be assessed as "[[Critically Endangered]]" under the [[IUCN Red List]] criteria and recommended immediate conservation action to protect the Cerro El Ahuaca population and further research into its biology.<ref name=Lea54/>
