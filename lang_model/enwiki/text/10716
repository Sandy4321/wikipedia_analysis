'''Dionysius I''' or '''Dionysius the Elder''' (ca. [[432 BC|432]]&ndash;[[367 BC]], [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''<U+0394><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03BD><U+03CD><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2>''), tyrant of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], conquered several cities in [[Sicily]] and southern [[Italy]], opposed [[Carthage]]'s influence in Sicily and made Syracuse the most powerful of the Western [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] colonies. He was regarded by the ancients as an example of the worst kind of despot--cruel, suspicious and vindictive. 

==Early life==
Dionysius I began life as a clerk in a public office. Because of his achievements in the war against Carthage that had begun in [[409 BC]], he was elected supreme military commander in [[406 BC]]; in the following year he seized total power and became tyrant. In subsequent years he consolidated his position ruthlessly.

==Conquests==
He carried on war with Carthage with varying success; his attempts to drive the Carthaginians entirely out of the island of Sicily failed, and at his death they were masters of at least a third of it. He also carried on an expedition against [[Rhegium]] and its allied cities in ''[[Magna Graecia]]''. In one campaign, in which he was joined by the Lucanians, he devastated the territories of [[Thurii]], [[Crotone|Croton]] and [[Locri]].

After a protracted siege he took Rhegium ([[386 BC|386]]), and sold the inhabitants as [[slavery|slave]]s. He joined the [[Illyria]]ns in an attempt to plunder the temple of [[Delphi]], pillaged the temple of [[Caere]] on the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] coast, and founded several military colonies on the [[Adriatic]]. In the [[Peloponnesian War]] he espoused the side of the [[Sparta]]ns, and assisted them with [[mercenaries]].

==Name Association==
His name is most well known for the legends of [[Damocles]] and [[Damon and Pythias]].

He also posed as an author and patron of literature; his poems, severely criticized by [[Philoxenus]], were hissed at the Olympic games; but having gained a prize for a tragedy on the ''Ransom of Hector'' at the [[Lenaea]] at [[Athens]], he was so elated that he engaged in a debauch which proved fatal.

==Death==
According to others, he was poisoned by his physicians at the instigation of his son, [[Dionysius II of Syracuse|Dionysius the Younger]] who succeeded him as ruler of Syracuse. His life was written by [[Philistus]], but the work is not extant. 

Additionally, it is said that upon hearing news of his play, The Ransom of Hector, winning the competition at the Lanaean festival at Athens, he celebrated so fiercely that he drank himself to death.  Others report that he died of natural causes shortly after learning of the his play's victory in [[367 BC]].

==Intellectual Tastes==
Like [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Pisistratus]], tyrant of [[Athens]], Dionysius was fond of having literary men about him, such as the historian Philistus, the poet Philoxenus, and the philosopher [[Plato]], but treated them in a most arbitrary manner. Once he had Philoxenos arrested and brought before him for a poetry reading. Dionysius read his own work and the audience applauded. When he asked Philoxenos how he liked it, the poet replied only "take me back to the prison".

The [[Ear of Dionysius]] in Syracuse is an artificial limestone cave named after Dionysius.

==Fictional References==
A fictional version of Dionysius is a character in [[Mary Renault]]'s historical novel ''[[The Mask of Apollo]]''. He also features prominently in [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s [[historical novel]] ''[[The Arrows of Hercules]],'' as a patron of inventors on the island of [[Ortygia]] near Syracuse. He is the main character in [[Valerio Massimo Manfredi]]'s novel ''Tyrant''.
