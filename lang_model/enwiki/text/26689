'''[[Charon (mythology)|Charon]]'s [[obolos|obol]]''' is an [[Allusion|allusive]] term for the [[coin]] <!--NOT only the obol but also other coins --> placed in or on the mouth<ref>Neither ancient literary sources nor archaeological finds indicate that the ritual of Charon's obol explains the modern-era custom of placing a pair of coins on the eyes of the deceased, nor is the single coin said to have been placed specifically ''[[sublingual|sub lingua]]''. See "[[Charon's obol#Coins on the eyes?|Coins on the eyes?]]" below.</ref> of a dead person before burial. According to [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek]] and [[Latin literature|Latin literary sources]], the coin was a payment or bribe for the [[ferry]]man who conveyed souls across the river that divided the world of the living from the world of the dead. Archaeological examples of these coins have been called "the most famous [[grave goods]] from [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]."<ref>Ian Morris, ''Death-ritual and Social Structure in Classical Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 1992), p. 106 [http://books.google.com/books?id=Uyrr1dqhJcAC&pg=PA105&dq=%22The+most+famous+grave+goods+from+antiquity+must+be+Charon's+obols%22&hl=en&ei=rLG4TYeOEs_r0QGLyPBO&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22The%20most%20famous%20grave%20goods%20from%20antiquity%20must%20be%20Charon's%20obols%22&f=false online.]</ref>

The custom is primarily associated with the [[ancient Greeks]] and [[ancient Rome|Romans]]. It is also found in the [[Near East]] and [[Western Europe#Classical antiquity and medieval origins|Western Europe]], particularly in the regions inhabited by [[Celts]] of the [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]], [[Hispania|Hispano-Roman]] and [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] cultures. Sporadic examples into the early 20th century are present among the [[Germanic peoples]] of [[Late Antiquity|late antiquity]] and the [[History of Christianity|early Christian era]].

Although archaeology shows that the [[classical mythology|myth]] reflects an actual custom, the placement of coins with the dead was neither pervasive nor confined to a single coin in the deceased<U+2019>s mouth.<ref>Gregory Grabka, <U+201C>Christian [[Viaticum]]: A Study of Its Cultural Background,<U+201D> ''Traditio'' 9 (1953), 1<U+2013>43, especially p. 8; Susan T. Stevens, <U+201C>Charon<U+2019>s Obol and Other Coins in Ancient Funerary Practice,<U+201D> ''Phoenix'' 45 (1991) 215<U+2013>229.</ref>  In many burials, [[Totenpass|inscribed metal-leaf tablets]] or [[exonumia]] take the place of the coin, or [[Charon's obol#Goldblattkreuze|gold-foil crosses]] in the early Christian era. The presence of coins or a [[hoard|coin-hoard]] in Germanic [[ship burial|ship-burials]] suggests an [[Analogue (literature)|analogous]] concept.<ref>Discussed under "[[Charon's obol#Archaeological evidence|Archaeological evidence]]".</ref>

The phrase "Charon<U+2019>s obol" as used by archaeologists sometimes can be understood as referring to a particular religious rite, but often serves as a kind of shorthand for coinage as grave goods presumed to further the deceased<U+2019>s passage into the [[Afterlife#Afterlife in ancient religions|afterlife]].<ref>Morris, ''Death-ritual and Social Structure in Classical Antiquity'', p. 106, noting in his skeptical discussion of <U+201C>Who Pays the Ferryman?<U+201D> that <U+201C>coins may have paid the ferryman, but that is not all that they did.<U+201D> See also Keld Grinder-Hansen, <U+201C>Charon<U+2019>s Fee in Ancient Greece?<U+201D> ''Acta Hyperborea'' 3 (1991), p. 215, who goes so far as to assert that <U+201C>there is very little evidence in favour of a connection between the Charon myth and the death-coin practice,<U+201D> but the point is primarily that the term <U+201C>Charon<U+2019>s obol<U+201D> belongs to the discourse of myth and literature rather than the discipline of archaeology.</ref> In [[Latin]], Charon's obol sometimes is called a ''[[viaticum]]'', or "sustenance for the journey"; the placement of the coin on the mouth has been explained also as a seal to protect the deceased's soul or to prevent it from returning.

In Greek mythology, [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] is the ferryman of [[Hades]] who carries souls of the newly deceased across the rivers [[Styx]] and [[Acheron]] that divided the world of the living from the world of the dead. A coin to pay Charon for passage was sometimes placed in or on the mouth of a dead person. The coin is conventionally referred to in literature as an [[Obolus|obol]] ([[ancient Greek|Greek]] ''obolos'', <U+1F40><U+03B2><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+03CC><U+03C2>), one of the basic [[denomination (currency)|denominations]] of [[ancient Greek coinage]], worth one-sixth of a [[drachma]].<ref>Depending on whether a [[copper]] or [[silver standard]] was used; see Verne B.

===Charon's obol as viaticum===
In Latin, Charon<U+2019>s obol is sometimes called a ''viaticum,''<ref>[[Plautus]], ''[[Poenulus]]'' 71 (late 3rd<U+2013>early 2nd century BC), where a rich man lacks the ''viaticum'' for the journey because of the stinginess of his heir; Apuleius, ''[[The Golden Ass|Metamorphoses]]'' 6.18 (2nd century A.D.), discussed [[Charon's obol#The catabasis of Psyche|below]].</ref> which in everyday usage means <U+201C>provision for a journey<U+201D> (from ''via'', <U+201C>way, road, journey<U+201D>), encompassing food, money and other supplies. The same word can refer to the living allowance granted to those stripped of their property and condemned to exile,<ref>As in [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Ad Helviam matrem de consolatione'' 12.4; see Mary V. Braginton, <U+201C>Exile under the Roman Emperors,<U+201D> ''Classical Journal'' 39 (1944), pp. 397<U+2013>398.</ref> and by [[metaphor]]ical extension to preparing for death at the end of life<U+2019>s journey.<ref>Entry on ''viaticum'', '' [[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1982, 1985 printing), p. 2054; Lewis and Short, ''[[A Latin Dictionary]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1879, 1987 printing), p. 1984.</ref> [[Cicero]], in his philosophical dialogue ''[[On Old Age]]'' (44 BC), has the [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]] [[Cato the Elder]] combine two metaphors <U+2014> nearing the end of a journey, and ripening fruit <U+2014> in speaking of the approach to death:

{{cquote|I don<U+2019>t understand what greed should want for itself in old age; for can anything be sillier than to acquire more provisions (''viaticum'') as less of the journey remains?<ref>[[Marcus Tullius Cicero]], ''De senectute'' 18.66: ''Avaritia vero senilis quid sibi velit, non intellego; potest enim quicquam esse absurdius quam, quo viae minus restet, eo plus viatici quaerere?'' Compare the metaphor of death as a journey also in [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], ''De re rustica'' 1.1.1: <U+201C>My 80th birthday warns me to pack my bags before I set forth from this life.<U+201D></ref> <U+2026> Fruits, if they are green, can scarcely be wrenched off the trees; if they are ripe and softened, they fall. In the same way, violence carries off the life of young men; old men, the fullness of time. To me this is so richly pleasing that, the nearer I draw to death, I seem within sight of [[wikt:landfall|landfall]], as if, at an unscheduled time, I will come into the harbor after a long voyage.<ref>Cicero, ''De senectute'' 19.71: ''et quasi poma ex arboribus, cruda si sunt, vix evelluntur, si matura et cocta, decidunt, sic vitam adulescentibus vis aufert, senibus maturitas; quae quidem mihi tam iucunda est, ut, quo propius ad mortem accedam, quasi terram videre videar aliquandoque in portum ex longa navigatione esse venturus.''</ref>}}

Drawing on this metaphorical sense of <U+201C>provision for the journey into death,<U+201D> [[ecclesiastical Latin]] borrowed the term ''[[viaticum]]'' for the form of [[Eucharist]] that is placed in the mouth of a person who is dying as provision for the soul<U+2019>s passage to eternal life.<ref>Grabka, <U+201C>Christian Viaticum,<U+201D> p. 27; Stevens, <U+201C>Charon<U+2019>s Obol,<U+201D> pp. 220<U+2013>221.</ref> The earliest literary evidence of this Christian usage for ''viaticum'' appears in [[Paulinus of Nola|Paulinus]]<U+2019>s account of the death of St. [[Ambrose]] in 397 AD.<ref>[[Paulinus of Nola]], ''Vita Sancti Ambrosii'' 47.3, ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' 14:43 (''Domini corpus, quo accepto, ubi glutivit, emisit spiritum, bonum viaticum secum ferens''). The [[Reserved sacrament|Eucharist for the dying]] was prescribed by the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, but without using the term ''viaticum''. Discussion in Frederick S. Paxton, ''Christianizing Death: The Creation of a Ritual Process in Early Medieval Europe'' (Cornell University Press 1990), [http://books.google.com/books?id=zvG9jFdTszMC&pg=PA33&dq=%22provision+for+the+journey%22+intitle:Christianizing+intitle:Death&lr=&num=10&as_brr=0&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22provision%20for%20the%20journey%22%20intitle%3AChristianizing%20intitle%3ADeath&f=false  p. 33]. Paxton, along with other scholars he cites, holds that administering the Eucharist to the dying was already established practice in the 4th century; <U+00C9>ric Rebillard has argued that instances in the 3rd-4th centuries were exceptions, and that not until the 6th century was the viaticum administered on a regular basis (''In hora mortis: Evolution de la pastorale chr<U+00E9>tienne de la mort aux IV et V si<U+00E8>cles dan l<U+2019>Occident latin'', <U+00C9>cole Fran<U+00E7>aise de Rome 1994). See also Paxton<U+2019>s review of this work, ''American Historical Review'' 101 (1996) 1528. Those who view the practice as earlier think it was used as a Christian alternative to Charon<U+2019>s obol; for those who hold that it is later, the viaticum is seen as widely administered only after it was no longer regarded as merely a disguised pre-Christian tradition. Further discussion under [[Charon's obol#Christian transformation|Christian transformation]] below.</ref> The 7th-century ''Synodus Hibernensis'' offers an [[etymology|etymological]] explanation: <U+201C>This word <U+2018>viaticum<U+2019> is the name of [[Eucharist|communion]], that is to say, <U+2018>the guardianship of the way,<U+2019> for it guards the soul until it shall stand before the [[Judgment Day|judgment]]-[[Mercy seat#In the Pauline Epistles|seat]] of [[Christ]].<U+201D><ref>''Synodus Hibernensis'' (preserved in the 8th-century ''[[Collectio canonum Hibernensis]]''), book 2, chapter 16 (p. 20 in the edition of Wasserschleben), cited in [[William Smith (lexicographer)|Smith]], ''A Dictionary of Christian Antiquities'', p. 2014.</ref> [[Thomas Aquinas]] explained the term as <U+201C>a [[Typology (theology)|prefiguration]] of the fruit of God, which will be in the [[promised land]]. And because of this it is called the ''viaticum'', since it provides us with the way of getting there<U+201D>; the idea of Christians as <U+201C>travelers in search of [[salvation]]<U+201D> finds early expression in the ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' of [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]].<ref>[[Thomas Aquinas]], ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', part 3, question 73, article V, discussed in Benjamin Brand, <U+201C>''Viator ducens ad celestia'': Eucharistic [[Piety]], [[Pope|Papal]] Politics, and an Early Fifteenth-Century [[Motet]],<U+201D> ''Journal of Musicology'' 20 (2003), pp. 261<U+2013>262, especially note 24; see also Claude Carozzi, <U+201C>Les vivants et les morts de Saint Augustin <U+00E0> [[Julian of Toledo|Julien de Tol<U+00E8>de]],<U+201D> in ''Le voyage de l<U+2019><U+00E2>me dans l<U+2019>Au-Del<U+00E0> d<U+2019>apr<U+00E8>s la litt<U+00E9>rature latine (Ve<U+2013>XIIIe si<U+00E8>cle)'', Collection de l<U+2019><U+00C9>cole Fran<U+00E7>aise de Rome 189 (Palais Farn<U+00E8>se, 1994), pp. 13<U+2013>34 on [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].</ref>

An equivalent word in Greek is ''ephodion'' (<U+1F10><U+03C6><U+03CC><U+03B4><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03BD>); like ''viaticum'', the word is used in antiquity to mean <U+201C>provision for a journey<U+201D> (literally, <U+201C>something for the road,<U+201D> from the prefix <U+1F10><U+03C0>-, <U+201C>on<U+201D> + <U+1F41><U+03B4><U+03CC><U+03C2>, <U+201C>road, way<U+201D>)<ref>Liddell and Scott, ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1843, 1985 printing), entry on <U+1F10><U+03C6><U+03BF><U+03B4><U+03B5><U+03AF><U+03B1>, pp. 745<U+2013>746.</ref> and later in Greek [[Church Fathers|patristic]] literature for the Eucharist administered on the point of death.<ref>Grabka, <U+201C>Christian Viaticum,<U+201D> p. 27.</ref>

Greek and Roman literary sources from the 5th century BC through the 2nd century AD are consistent in attributing four characteristics to Charon<U+2019>s obol:
:* it is a single, low-denomination coin;
:* it is placed in the mouth;
:* the placement occurs at the time of death;
:* it represents a boat fare.<ref>Susan T. Stevens, <U+201C>Charon<U+2019>s Obol," p. 216.</ref>

The incongruity of paying what is, in effect, [[Admission to an event or establishment|admission]] to [[Hell]] encouraged a [[Ancient Greek comedy|comic]] or satiric treatment, and Charon as a ferryman who must be persuaded, threatened, or bribed to do his job appears to be a literary construct that is not reflected in early classical art. [[Christiane Sourvinou-Inwood]] has shown that in 5th-century BC depictions of Charon, as on the funerary vases called [[lekythos|lekythoi]], he is a non-threatening, even reassuring presence who guides women, adolescents, and children to the afterlife.<ref>Because neither adult males (who were expected to be prepared to face immiment death in the course of military service) nor elderly women are represented, Charon<U+2019>s gentler demeanor may be intended to ease the transition for those who faced an uexpected or untimely death.

The use of coins as [[grave goods]] shows a variety of practice that casts doubt on the accuracy of the term <U+201C>Charon<U+2019>s obol<U+201D> as an [[Hermeneutics|interpretational category]]. The phrase continues to be used, however, to suggest the ritual or religious significance of coinage in a funerary context.

Coins are found in Greek burials by the 5th century BC, as soon as Greece was [[monetary economy|monetized]], and appear throughout the [[Roman Empire]] into the 5th century AD, with examples conforming to the Charon<U+2019>s obol type as far west as the [[Iberian Peninsula]], north into [[Roman Britain|Britain]], and east to the [[Vistula river]] in [[Poland in Antiquity|Poland]].<ref>W.

Some of the oldest coins from [[Mediterranean]] tombs have been found on [[Ancient history of Cyprus|Cyprus]]. In 2001 Destrooper-Georgiades, a specialist in [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] [[numismatics]], said that investigations of 33 tombs had yielded 77 coins. Although denomination varies, as does the number in any given burial, small coins predominate. Coins started to be placed in tombs almost as soon as they came into [[Circulation (currency)|circulation]] on the island in the 6th century, and some predate both the first issue of the obol and any literary reference to Charon<U+2019>s fee.<ref>A.

Although only a small percentage of Greek burials contain coins, among these there are widespread examples of a single coin positioned in the mouth of a skull or with cremation remains. In cremation urns, the coin sometimes adheres to the jawbone of the skull.<ref>For description of an example from Athens, see H.B. Walters, ''Catalogue of the [[Greek terracotta figurines|Terracottas]] in the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities'' ([[British Museum]], 1903), [http://books.google.com/books?id=H3kpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA186&dq=Charon+%22adhering+to%22&lr=&as_brr=0 p. 186.]</ref> At [[Olynthus]], 136 coins (mostly bronze, but some silver), were found with burials; in 1932, archaeologists reported that 20 graves had each contained four bronze coins, which they believed were intended for placement in the mouth.<ref>David M.

A notable use of a [[danake]] occurred in the burial of a woman in 4th-century BC [[Thessaly]], a likely [[Initiation#Religious and other spiritual initiations|initiate]] into the [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] or [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]] [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]].

The Black Sea region has also produced examples of Charon<U+2019>s obol.

It is unclear whether the dead were Colchians or Greeks.

Charon<U+2019>s obol is usually regarded as [[Hellenic civilization|Hellenic]], and a single coin in burials is often taken as a mark of [[Hellenization]],<ref>See Tamila Mgaloblishvili, ''Ancient Christianity in the [[Caucasus]]'' (Routledge, 1998), [http://books.google.com/books?id=PkZjdVAzsvIC&pg=PA36&dq=%22Charon%27s+obol%22&lr=&num=100&as_brr=3&sig=ACfU3U1-bCrFMxrnsfuQsxa0m2B9igYGig#PPA35,M1 pp. 35<U+2013>36.]</ref> but the practice may be independent of Greek influence in some regions.

Cemeteries in the Western Roman Empire vary widely: in a 1st-century BC community in [[Cisalpine Gaul]], coins were included in more than 40 percent of graves, but none was placed in the mouth of the deceased; the figure is only 10 percent for cremations at [[Emp<U+00FA>ries]] in Spain and [[York]] in Britain.

In one [[Merovingian]] cemetery of [[Fr<U+00E9>nouville]], [[Normandy]], which was in use for four centuries in the early [[Common Era]], coins are found in a minority of the graves. At one time, the cemetery was regarded as exhibiting two distinct phases: an earlier [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] period when the dead were buried with vessels, notably of [[Roman glass|glass]], and Charon<U+2019>s obol; and later, when they were given funerary dress and goods according to [[Franks|Frankish]] custom. This neat division, however, has been shown to be misleading. In the 3rd- to 4th-century area of the cemetery, coins were placed near the skulls or hands, sometimes protected by a [[money pouch|pouch]] or vessel, or were found in the grave-fill as if tossed in. Bronze coins usually numbered one or two per grave, as would be expected from the custom of Charon<U+2019>s obol, but one burial contained 23 bronze coins, and another held a [[solidus (coin)|gold solidus and a ''semissis'']]. The latter examples indicate that coins might have represented relative [[social status]]. In the newer part of the cemetery, which remained in use through the 6th century, the deposition patterns for coinage were similar, but the coins themselves were not contemporaneous with the burials, and some were pierced for wearing. The use of older coins may reflect a shortage of new currency, or may indicate that the old coins held a traditional symbolic meaning apart from their denominational value. <U+201C>The varied placement of coins of different values <U+2026> demonstrates at least partial if not complete loss of understanding of the original religious function of Charon<U+2019>s obol,<U+201D> remarks Bonnie Effros, a specialist in Merovingian burial customs. <U+201C>These factors make it difficult to determine the rite<U+2019>s significance.<U+201D><ref>Bonnie Effros, <U+201C>Grave Goods and the Ritual Expression of Identity,<U+201D> in ''From Roman Provinces to Medieval Kingdoms'', edited by Thomas F.X.

[[Scandinavia]]n and Germanic [[Bracteate|gold bracteates]] found in burials of the 5th and 6th centuries, particularly those in Britain, have also been interpreted in light of Charon<U+2019>s obol. These gold disks, similar to coins though generally single-sided, were influenced by late Roman imperial coins and medallions but feature [[iconography]] from [[Norse mythology|Norse myth]] and [[Runic alphabet|runic]] inscriptions. The stamping process created an extended rim that forms a frame with a loop for threading; the bracteates often appear in burials as a woman<U+2019>s necklace. A function comparable to that of Charon<U+2019>s obol is suggested by examples such as a man<U+2019>s burial at [[Monkton, Thanet|Monkton]] in Kent and a group of several male graves on [[Gotland]], Sweden, for which the bracteate was deposited in a pouch beside the body. In the Gotland burials, the bracteates lack rim and loop, and show no traces of wear, suggesting that they had not been intended for everyday use.<ref>M<U+00E4>rit Gaimster, <U+201C>Scandinavian Gold Bracteates in Britain,<U+201D> ''Medieval Archaeology'' 36 (1992), [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-769-1/ahds/dissemination/pdf/vol36/36_001_028.pdf pdf here]; see also Morten Axboe and Anne Kromann, <U+201C>''DN ODINN P F AUC''?

According to one interpretation, the purse-[[hoard]] in the [[Sutton Hoo]] [[ship burial]] ([[Suffolk]], [[East Anglia]]), which contained a variety of [[Merovingian#Numismatics|Merovingian gold coins]], unites the traditional Germanic voyage to the afterlife with <U+201C>an unusually splendid form of Charon<U+2019>s obol.<U+201D> The burial yielded 37 gold [[Tremissis|tremisses]] dating from the late 6th and early 7th century, three unstruck coin blanks, and two small gold [[ingot]]s.

So-called <U+201C>ghost coins<U+201D> also appear with the dead. These are impressions of an actual coin or numismatic icon struck into a small piece of gold foil.<ref>L.V.

In a marble [[cremation]] box from the mid-2nd century BC, the "Charon's piece"  took the form of a bit of gold foil stamped with an owl; in addition to the charred bone fragments, the box also contained gold leaves from a wreath of the type sometimes associated with the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religions]].<ref>Cedric G. Boulter, <U+201C>Graves in Lenormant Street, Athens,<U+201D> ''Hesperia'' 32 (1963), pp. 115 and 126, with other examples cited.

These examples of the "Charon's piece" resemble in material and size the tiny inscribed tablet or funerary amulet called a ''lamella'' (Latin for a metal-foil sheet) or a ''[[Totenpass]]'', a <U+201C>passport for the dead<U+201D> with instructions on navigating the afterlife, conventionally regarded as a form of Orphic or Dionysiac [[Devotional medal#History|devotional]].<ref>Roy Kotansky, <U+201C>Incantations and Prayers for Salvation on Inscribed Greek Amulets,<U+201D> in ''Magika Hiera: Ancient Greek Magic and Religion,'' edited by Christopher A.

She wore a wreath made from gold oak leaves, and her clothing had been sewn with gold-leaf ovals decorated with female faces.

Textual evidence also exists for covering portions of the deceased<U+2019>s body with gold foil. One of the accusations of [[heresy]] against the [[Phrygia]]n Christian movement known as the [[Montanism|Montanists]] was that they sealed the mouths of their dead with plates of gold like initiates into the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]];<ref>J.-B.

====''Goldblattkreuze''====
[[Image:Tremissis Julius Nepos-RIC 3221.jpg|thumb|A ''tremissis'' of [[Julius Nepos]] with cross on reverse (''5th century'')]]
In Gaul and in [[Alamanni|Alemannic]] territory, Christian graves of the Merovingian period reveal an analogous [[Christianization|Christianized]] practice in the form of gold or gold-alloy leaf shaped like a cross,<ref>The British Museum has [http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_image.aspx?image=ps208644.jpg&retpage=20511 an example.]</ref> imprinted with designs, and deposited possibly as [[Votive deposit|votives]] or amulets for the deceased. These paper-thin, fragile gold crosses are sometimes referred to by scholars with the [[German language|German]] term ''Goldblattkreuze''. They appear to have been sown onto the deceased<U+2019>s garment just before burial, not worn during life,<ref>Bonnie Effros, ''Caring for Body and Soul: Burial and the Afterlife in the [[Merovingian]] World'' (Penn State Press, 2002), pp. 48 and 158, with additional references in note 78.</ref> and in this practice are comparable to the pierced Roman coins found in Anglo-Saxon graves that were attached to clothing instead of or in addition to being threaded onto a necklace.<ref>T.S.N.

====Scandinavian 'temple money'====
Scandinavia also produced unique gold-foil pieces, described as small and fragile, worked in [[repouss<U+00E9>]] with human figures, beginning in the pre-Viking period and continuing at least through the 10th century. Though in form they recall the gold-foil pieces such as those found at Douris, these were not fashioned with a fastening element and are not associated with burials. They occur in the archaeological record sometimes singly, but most often in large numbers. Scholars have speculated that they are a form of <U+201C>temple money<U+201D> or votive offering.<ref>Signe Horn Fuglesang, <U+201C>Viking and Medieval Amulets in Scandinavia,<U+201D> ''Fornv<U+00E4>nnen'' 84 (1989), pp. 18<U+2013>19, figures with examples pp. 20<U+2013>22.</ref>

==Religious significance==

Ships often appear in Greek and Roman funerary art representing a voyage to the [[Fortunate Isles|Isles of the Blessed]], and a 2nd-century [[sarcophagus]] found in [[Velletri]], near Rome, included Charon<U+2019>s boat among its subject matter.<ref>Marion Lawrence, <U+201C>Ships, Monsters and Jonah,<U+201D> ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 66 (1962), p. 291, note 9.</ref> In modern-era Greek [[folklore|folkloric]] survivals of Charon (as Charos the death demon), sea voyage and river crossing are [[conflation|conflated]], and in one later tale, the soul is held hostage by pirates, perhaps representing the oarsmen, who require a ransom for release.<ref>John Cuthbert Lawson, ''Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion: A Study in Survivals'' (Cambridge University Press, 1910), p. 108.</ref> The [[mytheme]] of the passage to the afterlife as a voyage or crossing is not unique to Greco-Roman belief nor to [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] culture as a whole, as it occurs also in [[ancient Egyptian religion]]<ref>See, for instance, article on the Egyptian god [[Aken (god)|Aken]].</ref> and other belief systems that are culturally unrelated.<ref>Grabka, <U+201C>Christian Viaticum," pp. 2<U+2013>3.

===Death and Wealth===
[[Image:Dionysos Ploutos BM F68.jpg|left|thumb|Dionysus and Ploutos ("Wealth") with the [[Cornucopia|horn of abundance]], 4th century BC]]
In cultures that practiced the rite of Charon<U+2019>s obol, the infernal ferryman who requires payment is one of a number of underworld deities associated with wealth. For the Greeks, [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] (''Plout<U+014D>n'', <U+03A0><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03CD><U+03C4><U+03C9><U+03BD>), the ruler of the dead and the consort of [[Persephone]], became [[conflation|conflated]] with [[Plutus]] (''Ploutos'', <U+03A0><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+1FE6><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C2>), wealth [[Personification|personified]]; [[Plato]] points out the meaningful ambiguity of this etymological play in his [[dialogue]] ''[[Cratylus]]''.<ref>[[Plato]], ''[[Cratylus]]'' 403a. The interpretation is expressed by  [[Socrates]] as one of the interlocutors. The ''Cratylus'' deals extensively with etymology.</ref> [[Hermes]] is a god of boundaries, travel, and [[liminality]], and thus conveys souls across the border that separates the living from the dead, acting as a [[psychopomp]], but he was also a god of exchange, commerce, and profit.<ref>Sourvinou-Inwood, ''<U+201C>Reading<U+201D> Greek Death'', p. 313.</ref> The name of his [[interpretatio graeca|Roman counterpart]] [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] was thought in antiquity to share its derivation with the Latin word ''merces'', <U+201C>goods, merchandise.<U+201D><ref>In antiquity, the most common etymology was ''a mercibus'', from ''merces'' ("merchandise"); see Michael Paschalis, ''Virgil's Aeneid'' (Oxford University Press, 1997), p. 58 [http://books.google.com/books?id=o5-3qxjL6lgC&pg=RA1-PA58&dq=etymology+name+Mercurius&lr=&num=100&as_brr=0&as_pt=ALLTYPES online.] In ''De civitate Dei'', [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] proposes an etymology from ''medius currens'', "running in the middle," explaining that "language 'runs' like a sort of mediator between men'"; cited by Antoine Faivre, ''The Eternal Hermes'' (Red Wheel/Weiser, 1995), p. 82 [http://books.google.com/books?id=9A2UMwrR12kC&pg=PA82&dq=etymology+name+Mercurius&lr=&num=100&as_brr=0&as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]</ref>

The numerous [[chthonic]] deities among the Romans were also frequently associated with wealth. In his treatise [[De natura deorum|''On the Nature of the Gods'']], Cicero identifies the Roman god [[Dis Pater]] with the Greek Pluton,<ref>''Diti patri <U+2026> qui dives ut apud Graecos <U+03A0><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03CD><U+03C4><U+03C9><U+03BD>'' (<U+201C>Father Dis who, being rich, is Pluto among the Greeks<U+201D>), ''[[De natura deorum]]'' 2.66.</ref> explaining that riches are hidden in and arise from the earth.<ref>E.J. Kenney, text, translation and commentary, ''Cupid and Psyche'' (Cambridge University Press, 1990), p. 214.</ref> Dis Pater is sometimes regarded as a chthonic [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], ruler of the [[Golden Age#Greek and Roman antiquity|Golden Age]], whose consort [[Ops]] was a goddess of abundance.<ref>H.S. Versnel, ''Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion'', vol. 2 (Brill, 1993), p. 175 ''et passim''.</ref> The obscure goddess [[Angerona]], whose [[iconography]] depicted silence and secrecy,<ref>Susan Savage, <U+201C>Remotum a Notitia Vulgari,<U+201D> ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' 76 (1945) p. 164, note 38.</ref> and whose festival followed that of Ops, seems to have regulated communications between the realm of the living and the underworld;<ref>H.S.

The [[Roman Republic|Republican]] poet [[Ennius]] locates the <U+201C>treasuries of Death<U+201D> across the [[Acheron]].<ref>Ennius, ''Acherontem nunc obibo, ubi mortis thesauri obiacent'' (<U+201C>I will cross the [[Acheron]], where the treasuries of death lie hidden<U+201D>), from the lost tragedy ''[[Iphigenia]]''; the line is spoken by the protagonist as she faces the prospect of becoming a human sacrifice. The phrase <U+201C>treasures of Death<U+201D> is original to the Latin poet<U+2019>s elaboration of his Greek model; see [[Eduard Fraenkel]], ''Plautine Elements in Plautus'', translated by Tomas Drevikovsky and Frances Muecke (Oxford University Press, 2007; originally published in German 1922), p. 121 [http://books.google.com/books?id=g2WNwu7OR7QC&pg=PA121&dq=Ennius+Acheron+Iphigenia&lr=&as_brr=3 online.]</ref> Romans threw an annual offering of coins into the [[Lacus Curtius]], a pit or chasm in the middle of the [[Roman forum]]<ref>See entry on <U+201C>Lacus Curtius<U+201D> from [[Samuel Ball Platner|Platner]] and [[Thomas Ashby|Ashby]], ''[[A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome]]'', Bill Thayer<U+2019>s edition with photos at [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Lacus_Curtius.html LacusCurtius.]</ref> that was regarded as a [[Lapis manalis#Gate to the underworld|''mundus'']] or <U+201C>port of communication<U+201D> with the underworld.<ref>Robert Maxwell Ogilvie, ''A Commentary on [[Livy]] Books 1<U+2013>5'' (Oxford 1965), pp. 75<U+2013>76.

From its 7th-century BC beginnings in western [[Anatolia]], ancient coinage was viewed not as distinctly secular, but as a form of communal trust bound up in the ties expressed by religion. The earliest known coin-hoard from [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] was found buried in a pot within the foundations of the [[Temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus]], dating to the mid-6th century BC. The iconography of gods and various divine beings appeared regularly on coins issued by Greek cities and later by Rome.<ref>Jonathan Williams, <U+201C>Religion and Roman Coins,<U+201D> in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', edited by J<U+00F6>rg R<U+00FC>pke (Blackwell Publishing, 2007), p. 143.</ref> The effect of monetization on religious practice is indicated by notations in [[Attic calendar|Greek calendars of sacrifices]] pertaining to fees for priests and prices for offerings and victims. One fragmentary text seems to refer to a single obol to be paid by each initiate of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] to the priestess of [[Demeter]], the symbolic value of which is perhaps to be interpreted in light of Charon<U+2019>s obol as the initiate<U+2019>s gaining access to knowledge required for successful passage to the afterlife.<ref>John K. Davies, <U+201C>Temples, Credit, and the Circulation of Money,<U+201D> in ''Money and Its Uses in the Ancient Greek World'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) p. 120 [http://books.google.com/books?id=35g0fewTrXoC&pg=PA120&dq=Money+and+Its+Uses+in+the+Ancient+Greek+World+%22tendency+to+monetize%22&lr=&as_brr=0 online.] See also Michael Vickers, <U+201C>Golden Greece: Relative Values, [[Mina (unit)|Minae]], and Temple Inventories,<U+201D> ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 94 (1990) 613<U+2013>625.</ref>

[[Erwin Rohde]] argued, on the basis of later folk customs, that the obol was originally a payment to the dead person himself, as a way of compensating him for the loss of property that passed to the living, or as a token substitute for the more ancient practice of consigning his property to the grave with him. In Rohde's view, the obol was later attached to the myth of the ferryman as an ''ex post facto'' explanation.<ref>[[Erwin Rohde]], ''Psyche: The Cult of Souls and the Belief in Immortality Among the Greeks'' (Routledge 1925; republished 2000), pp. 245<U+2013>246 [http://books.google.com/books?id=EsVTr_6c7E0C&pg=PA245&dq=obol+%22symbolical+vestige%22&lr=&as_brr=0 online.]</ref>

In the view of [[Richard Seaford]], the introduction of coinage to Greece and the theorizing about [[Value (philosophy)|value]] it provoked was concomitant with and even contributed to the creation of Greek [[metaphysics]].<ref>[[Richard Seaford]], <U+201C>Reading Money: Leslie Kurke on the Politics of Meaning in Ancient Greece,<U+201D> ''Arion'' 9 (2002) 145<U+2013>165, introducing ideas developed in ''Money and the Early Greek Mind: Homer, Philosophy, Tragedy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004).</ref> [[Plato]] criticizes common currency as <U+201C>polluting<U+201D>, but also says that the guardians of [[The Republic (Plato)|his ideal republic]] should have divine gold and silver money from the gods always present in their souls.<ref>[[Plato]], ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' 417a and 416e.</ref> This Platonic <U+201C>money in the soul<U+201D> holds the promise of <U+201C>divinity, homogeneity, unchanging permanence, self-sufficiency, invisibility.<U+201D><ref>Richard Seaford, <U+201C>Reading Money,<U+201D> ''Arion'' 9 (2002), p. 163.</ref>

===The coin as food or seal===
Attempts to explain the symbolism of the rite also must negotiate the illogical placement of the coin in the mouth. The Latin term ''viaticum'' makes sense of Charon<U+2019>s obol as <U+201C>sustenance for the journey,<U+201D> and it has been suggested that coins replaced offerings of food for the dead in Roman tradition.<ref>Stevens, <U+201C>Charon<U+2019>s Obol," p. 220.</ref>

This dichotomy of food for the living and gold for the dead is a theme in the myth of [[Midas|King Midas]], versions of which draw on elements of the [[Dionysian mysteries]]. The [[Phrygia]]n king's famous "golden touch" was a divine gift from Dionysus, but its acceptance separated him from the human world of nourishment and reproduction: both his food and his daughter were transformed by contact with him into immutable, unreciprocal gold. In some versions of the myth, Midas's hard-won insight into the meaning of life and the limitations of earthly wealth is accompanied by conversion to the [[cult of Dionysus]]. Having learned his lessons as an initiate into the mysteries, and after ritual immersion in the river [[Pactolus]], Midas forsakes the <U+201C>bogus eternity<U+201D> of gold for spiritual rebirth.<ref>Richard Seaford, ''Money and the Early Greek Mind: Homer, Philosophy, Tragedy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004), pp. 143, 150, 259, 284, 306<U+2013>308, limited preview [http://books.google.com/books?id=kU6xx-DAgFgC&pg=PP1&dq=intitle:Money+intitle:and+intitle:the+intitle:Early+intitle:Greek+intitle:Mind&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=0 online.]</ref>

John Cuthbert Lawson, an early 20th-century folklorist whose approach was influenced by the [[Cambridge Ritualists]], argued that both the food metaphor and the coin as payment for the ferryman were later rationalizations of the original ritual. Although single coins from [[inhumation]]s appear most often inside or in the vicinity of the skull, they are also found in the hand or a pouch, a more logical place to carry a payment.<ref name="John Cuthbert Lawson 1910 pp. 108">John Cuthbert Lawson, ''Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion'' (Cambridge University Press, 1910), pp. 108<U+2013>114.</ref> Lawson viewed the coin as originally a seal, used as potsherds sometimes were on the lips of the dead to block the return of the soul, believed to pass from the body with the last breath. One of the first steps in preparing a corpse was to seal the lips, sometimes with linen or gold bands, to prevent the soul<U+2019>s return.<ref>Stevens, <U+201C>Charon<U+2019>s Obol,<U+201D> p. 221.</ref> The stopping of the mouth by Charon's obol has been used to illuminate burial practices intended, for instance, to prevent [[vampire]]s or other [[Revenant (folklore)|revenants]] from returning.<ref>For discussion, see the article on [[Vampire]]s, particularly "[[Vampire#Creating vampires|Creating vampires]]" and "[[Vampire#Protection|Protection]]."</ref>

The placement of the coin on the mouth can be compared to practices pertaining to the disposition of the dead in the Near East. An Egyptian custom is indicated by a burial at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], dating from the [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|22nd Dynasty]] (945<U+2013>720 BC) or later, for which the deceased woman's mouth was covered with a [[faience]] ''[[Eye of Horus|uadjet]]'', or protective eye amulet.<ref>''Mistress of the House, Mistress of Heaven: Women in Ancient Egypt'' (Cincinnati Art Museum, 1996), p. 74  [http://books.google.com/books?id=1pkH3QP390gC&pg=PA74&dq=%22placed+over+the+deceased%27s+mouth%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]</ref> Oval mouth coverings, perforated for fastening, are found in burials throughout the Near East from the 1st century BC through the 1st century AD, providing evidence of an analogous practice for sealing the mouths of the dead in regions not under Roman Imperial control.

A coin may make a superior seal because of its iconography; in the Thessalian burial of an initiate described [[Charon's obol#Hellenized world|above]], for instance, the coin on the lips depicted the [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] device of the Gorgon<U+2019>s head.

===The catabasis of Psyche===
:''See [[Cupid and Psyche]] for a synopsis of Apuleius's narrative.''

In the 2nd-century <U+201C>Cupid and Psyche<U+201D> narrative by Apuleius, Psyche, whose name is a Greek word for <U+201C>soul,<U+201D> is sent on an underworld quest to retrieve the box containing [[Proserpina]]<U+2019>s secret beauty, in order to restore the love of Cupid. The tale lends itself to multiple interpretational approaches, and it has frequently been analyzed as an [[Cupid and Psyche#As Platonic allegory|allegory of Platonism]] as well as of religious initiation, iterating on a smaller scale the plot of the ''Metamorphoses'' as a whole, which concerns the protagonist Lucius<U+2019>s journey towards [[salvation]] through the cult of [[Isis]].<ref>Sophia Papaioannou, <U+201C>Charite<U+2019>s Rape, Psyche on the Rock and the Parallel Function of Marriage in Apuleius<U+2019> ''Metamorphoses'',<U+201D> ''Mnemosyne'' 51 (1998), pp. 302<U+2013>303, citing G.B.

Before embarking on her [[Descent to the underworld|descent]], Psyche receives [[Totenpass|instructions for navigating the underworld]]:

{{cquote|The airway of [[Dis Pater|Dis]] is there, and through the yawning gates the pathless route is revealed. Once you cross the threshold, you are committed to the unswerving course that takes you to the very [[Regia]] of [[Orcus (mythology)|Orcus]].

The two coins serve the plot by providing Psyche with fare for the return; allegorically, this return trip suggests the soul<U+2019>s rebirth, perhaps a Platonic reincarnation or the divine form implied by the so-called Orphic gold tablets.

===Coins on the eyes?===
Contrary to popular [[Etiology#Mythology|aetiology]]<ref>As in [http://www.webcitation.org/5bnXLLojU collected responses] from [[Yahoo! Answers]], retrieved October 23, 2008, to a query about the custom.</ref> there is little evidence to connect the myth of Charon to the custom of placing a pair of coins on the eyes of the deceased, though the larger gold-foil coverings discussed [[Charon's obol#'Ghost' coins and crosses|above]] might include pieces shaped for the eyes.<ref>An example was found in the Macedonian warrior burials reported in 2008, and may be viewed [http://www.webcitation.org/5bcO9ETY1 online.]</ref> Pairs of coins are sometimes found in burials, including cremation urns; among the collections of the [[British Museum]] is an urn from Athens, ''ca.'' 300 BC, that contained cremated remains, two obols, and a terracotta figure of a mourning [[Siren (mythology)|siren]].<ref>[[British Museum]], [http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/t/terracotta_funerary_urn.aspx <U+201C>Terracotta funerary urn.<U+201D>]</ref> Ancient Greek and Latin literary sources, however, mention  a pair of coins only when a return trip is anticipated, as in the case of Psyche<U+2019>s catabasis, and never in regard to sealing the eyes.

Only rarely does the placement of a pair of coins suggest they might have covered the eyes. In [[Judea]], a pair of silver [[denarius|denarii]] were found in the eye sockets of a skull; the burial occurs within a Jewish community, but the religious affiliation of the deceased is unclear. Jewish ritual in antiquity did not require that the eye be sealed by an object, and it is debatable whether the custom of placing coins on the eyes of the dead was practiced among Jews prior to the modern era.<ref>Review of textual and archaeological evidence by Rachel Hachlili and Ann Killebrew, <U+201C>Was the Coin-on-Eye Custom a Jewish Burial Practice in the [[Second Temple]] Period?<U+201D> ''Biblical Archaeologist'' 46 (1983) 147<U+2013>153; also Rachel Hachlili, ''Jewish Funerary Customs, Practices and Rites in the Second Temple Period'' (Brill, 2005), pp. 437<U+2013>443, especially p. 440. Regarding the coins found by Hachlili, this emphatic denial: <U+201C>Nothing suggests that the coins as found by her were originally put upon the eyelids of the corpse, nor does such a custom exist at the time at all,<U+201D> in a letter to the editor by L.Y.

[[John Chrysostom]] mentions and disparages the use of coins depicting [[Alexander the Great]] as amulets attached by the living to the head or feet, and offers the Christian cross as a more powerful alternative for both salvation and healing:

{{cquote|And what is one to say about them who use charms and amulets, and encircle their heads and feet with golden coins of Alexander of Macedon. Are these our hopes, tell me, that after the cross and death of our Master, we should place our hopes of salvation on an image of a Greek king? Dost thou not know what great result the cross has achieved?

The hunt is also associated with the administering of a herbal viaticum in the medieval ''[[Chanson de geste|chansons de geste]]'', in which traditional heroic culture and Christian values interpenetrate.

Kay<U+2019>s conjecture that a pre-Christian tradition accounts for the use of leaves as the viaticum is supported by evidence from Hellenistic magico-religious practice, the continuance of which is documented in Gaul and among Germanic peoples.<ref>For example, J.H.G.

The insertion of herbs into the mouth of the dead, with a promise of resurrection, occurs also in the Irish tale "The Kern in the Narrow Stripes," the earliest written version of which dates to the 1800s but is thought to preserve an oral tradition of early Irish myth.<ref>J.A. MacCullough, ''The Mythology of All Races: Celtic and Slavic'' (Boston 1918), vol. 3, p. 60 [http://books.google.com/books?id=-pYYAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA60&dq=%22their+powers+survived%22&lr=&as_brr=0&as_pt=ALLTYPES  online], says the story demonstrates "how the memory of the Tuatha D<U+00E9> Danann and their powers survived into later centuries."</ref> The kern of the title is an otherworldly [[trickster]] figure who performs a series of miracles; after inducing twenty armed men to kill each other, he produces herbs from his bag and instructs his host's gatekeeper to place them within the jaws of each dead man to bring him back to life. At the end of the tale, the mysterious visitor is revealed as [[Manann<U+00E1>n mac Lir]], the Irish god known in other stories for his herd of pigs that offer eternal feasting from their self-renewing flesh.<ref>For translations, see Standish H.

In the 19th century, the German scholar Georg Heinrici proposed that Greek and Roman practices pertaining to the care of the dead, specifically including Charon<U+2019>s obol, shed light on vicarious baptism, or [[Baptism for the dead#Early history|baptism for the dead]], to which [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] refers in a [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|letter to the Corinthians]].<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:29|NIV}}.</ref> A century after Heinrici, James Downey examined the funerary practices of [[Corinth#Roman era|Christian Corinthians]] in historical context and argued that they intended vicarious baptism to protect the deceased<U+2019>s soul against interference on the journey to the afterlife.<ref>C.F.G. Heinrici, ''Das erste Sendschreiben des Apostel Paulus an die Korinthier'' (Berlin 1880), pp. 42<U+2013>43; James Downey, <U+201C>1 Cor 15:29 and the Theology of Baptism,<U+201D> ''Euntes Docete'' 38 (1985), pp. 23<U+2013>25 and 34<U+2013>35; cited by Richard E. DeMaris, <U+201C>Corinthian Religion and Baptism for the Dead,<U+201D> ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' 114 (1995), p. 676.</ref> Both vicarious baptism and the placement of a viaticum in the mouth of a person already dead reflect Christian responses to, rather than outright rejection of, ancient religious traditions pertaining to the cult of the dead.<ref>Richard E. DeMaris, <U+201C>Corinthian Religion and Baptism for the Dead,<U+201D> ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' 114 (1995) 661<U+2013>682; Mark J. Johnson, <U+201C>Pagan-Christian Burial Practices of the Fourth Century,<U+201D> ''Journal of Early Christian Studies'' 5 (1997), p. 43. Scholars do not maintain that Christians "borrowed" the rite of communion for the dying from earlier religious practice; the point is more specifically that the communion wafer itself might be used (or misused) in a manner influenced by Charon's obol and the ''lamellae''.</ref>

==Art of the modern era==
[[Image:Charon and Psyche (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|175px|''Charon and Psyche'' (detail) by [[John Roddam Spencer Stanhope]].<ref>''Charon and Psyche'' is privately owned; published images show two different orientations, with Charon either on the left with his left hand extended, as he is commonly depicted on the lekythoi, or on the right.</ref>]]
Although Charon has been a popular subject of art,<ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Charon_(mythology) Examples.]</ref> particularly in the 19th century, the act of payment is less often depicted. An exception is the ''Charon and Psyche'' of [[John Roddam Spencer Stanhope]], exhibited ''ca.'' 1883. The story of Cupid and Psyche found several expressions among the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artists and their literary peers,<ref>See [[Charon's obol#Modern poetry|Modern poetry]] following.</ref> and Stanhope, while mourning the death of his only child, produced a number of works dealing with the afterlife. His Psyche paintings were most likely based on the narrative poem of [[William Morris]] that was a retelling of the version by Apuleius.<ref>Nic Peeters and Judy Oberhausen, <U+201C>L<U+2019>Arte della memoria: John Roddam Spencer Stanhope and the Tomb of His Daughter Mary,<U+201D> from ''Marble Silence, Words on Stone: [[Florence]]<U+2019>s [[English Cemetery, Florence|English Cemetery]]'', The City and the Book III International Conference 3<U+2013>5 June 2004, [http://www.florin.ms/gimeld.html#peetersoberhausen online]; Simon Po<U+00EB>, <U+201C>Mythology and Symbolism in Two Works of Roddam Spencer Stanhope<U+2019>s Maturity,<U+201D> ''Journal of Pre-Raphaelite Studies'' 12 (2003) 35<U+2013>61.</ref> In Stanhope<U+2019>s vision, the ferryman is a calm and [[wikt:patriarchal|patriarchal]] figure more in keeping with the Charon of the archaic Greek lekythoi than the fearsome antagonist often found in Christian-era art and literature.<ref>Stanhope<U+2019>s father, also named John, was an [[Exploration|explorer]] and [[antiquarian]], and it is possible that the artist had firsthand knowledge of the archaic Charon from the [[antiquities|artifacts]] his father brought home; see Charles Waldstein, "Discoveries at [[Plataea|Plataia]] in 1890, I. General Report on the Excavations," ''American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts'' 6 (1890), p. 445.</ref>

The contemporary artist [[Bradley Platz]] extends the theme of Charon<U+2019>s obol as a [[viaticum|viatical]] food in his [[Oil painting|oil-on-canvas]] work ''Charon and the Shades'' (2007).<ref>Viewable [http://bp2.blogger.com/_EyaM2P3DD7k/RgyevLXY7vI/AAAAAAAAAAY/yremCHNN2RA/s1600-h/bradley+platz.jpg online.]</ref> In this depiction, Charon is a hooded, faceless figure of [[Death (personification)|Death]]; the transported soul regurgitates a stream of gold coins while the penniless struggle and beg on the shores.

==Modern poetry==
Poets of the modern era have continued to make use of Charon's obol as a living allusion. In "[[Don Juan]] aux enfers" ("Don Juan in Hell"), the French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symboliste]] poet [[Charles Baudelaire]] marks the eponymous hero's entry to the underworld with his payment of the obol to Charon.<ref>''Quand Don Juan descendit vers l'onde souterraine / Et lorsqu'il eut donn<U+00E9> son obole <U+00E0> Charon <U+2026> '' ("Don Juan aux enfers," lines 1<U+2013>2). Dual language edition of the poem in French and English [http://books.google.com/books?id=p8i33BpBn0oC&pg=PA34&dq=%22obole+<U+00E0>+Charon%22&lr=&num=100&as_brr=3#PPA35,M1 online.]</ref> Irish [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate]] [[Seamus Heaney]] makes a less direct allusion with a [[simile]] <U+2014> "words imposing on my tongue like obols" <U+2014> in the "Fosterage" section of his long poem ''Singing School'':<ref>Published in ''North'' (Oxford University Press, 1976).

{{cquote|The speaker associates himself with the dead, bearing payment for Charon the ferryman, to cross the [[river Styx]].
