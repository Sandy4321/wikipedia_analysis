[[Image:Middle east graphic 2003.jpg|300px|thumb|Political & transportation map of the Middle East today]] 

The '''Middle East''' is a [[region]] that spans southwestern [[Asia]] and northeastern [[Africa]]. It has no clear boundaries, often used as a synonym to [[Near East]], in opposition to [[Far East]]. The term "Middle East" was popularized around 1900 in the [[United Kingdom]]{{Fact|date=January 2009}}. The corresponding adjective to Middle East is ''Middle-Eastern'' and the derived noun is ''Middle-Easterner''.

The [[history of the Middle East]] dates back to [[Ancient Near East|ancient times]], and throughout its history the Middle East has been a major centre of world affairs. The Middle East is also the historical origin of three of the world<U+2019>s major religions<U+2014>[[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]. The Middle East generally has an [[arid]] and hot climate, with several major rivers providing for [[irrigation]] to support [[agriculture]] in limited areas. Many countries located around the [[Persian Gulf]] have large quantities of [[crude oil]]. In modern times the Middle East remains a strategically, economically, politically, culturally and religiously sensitive region.

==Etymology==
[[File:GreaterMiddleEast1.png|thumb|300px|The Middle East and Greater Middle East can have varying definitions and boundaries.]]
The term "Middle East" may have originated in the 1850s in the British [[India Office]],<ref>Beaumont (1988), p. 16</ref> and became more widely known when [[United States|American]] naval strategist [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] used the term.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Koppes, C.R. |title=Captain Mahan, General Gordon and the origin of the term "Middle East" |journal=Middle East Studies |volume=12 |pages=95<U+2013>98 |year=1976 |doi=10.1080/00263207608700307}}</ref> During this time the [[British Empire|British]] and [[Russian Empire]]s were vying for influence in [[Central Asia]], a rivalry which would become known as [[The Great Game]]. Mahan realized not only the strategic importance of the region, but also of its center, the [[Persian Gulf]].<ref>Melman, Billie. [http://cco.cambridge.org/extract?id=ccol052178140x_CCOL052178140XA010 The Cambridge Companion to Travel Writing: 6 The Middle East / Arabia], Cambridge Collections Online. Retrieved January 8, 2006.</ref><ref>Palmer, Michael A. ''Guardians of the Persian Gulf: A History of America's Expanding Role in the Persian Gulf, 1833-1992.'' New York: The Free Press, 1992. ISBN 0-02-923843-9 p. 12-13.</ref>  He labeled the area surrounding the Persian Gulf as the Middle East, and said that after the [[Suez Canal]], it was the most important passage for Britain to control in order to keep the Russians from advancing towards [[British Raj|India]].<ref>Laciner, Dr. Sedat. "[http://www.turkishweekly.net/comments.php?id=2117 Is There a Place Called <U+2018>the Middle East<U+2019>?]", ''The Journal of Turkish Weekly]", June 2, 2006. Retrieved January 10, 2007.</ref>  Mahan first used the term in his article "The Persian Gulf and International Relations," published in September 1902 in the ''[[National Review (London)|National Review]]'', a British journal.

<blockquote>The Middle East, if I may adopt a term which I have not seen, will some day need its Malta, as well as its Gibraltar; it does not follow that either will be in the Persian Gulf.  Naval force has the quality of mobility which carries with it the privilege of temporary absences; but it needs to find on every scene of operation established bases of refit, of supply, and in case of disaster, of security. The British Navy should have the facility to concentrate in force if occasion arise, about Aden, India, and the Persian Gulf.<ref>Adelson (1995), p. 22-23</ref></blockquote>

Mahan's article was reprinted in ''[[The Times]]'' and followed in October by a 20 article series entitled "The Middle Eastern Question," written by Sir [[Ignatius Valentine Chirol]].  During this series Sir Ignatius expanded the definition of the "Middle East" to include "those regions of Asia which extend to the borders of [[India]] or command the approaches to India."<ref>Adelson (1995), p. 24</ref>  With the series end in 1903, ''The Times'' removed quotation marks from subsequent uses of the term.<ref>Adelson (1995), p. 26</ref>

Until [[World War II]], it was customary to refer to areas centered around [[Turkey]] and the eastern shore of the Mediterranean as the "[[Near East]]," while the "[[Far East]]" centered on [[China]],<ref name="davison">{{cite journal |author=Davison, Roderic H. |title=Where is the Middle East? |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume=38 |pages=665<U+2013>675 |year=1960}}</ref> and the Middle East then meant the area from [[Mesopotamia]] to [[Myanmar|Burma]], namely the area between the Near East and the Far East.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}  In the late 1930s, the British established the [[Middle East Command]], which was based in [[Cairo]], for its military forces in the region.  After that time, the term "Middle East" gained broader usage in Europe and the United States, with the [[Middle East Institute]] founded in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1946, among other usage.<ref>{{cite book |author=Held, Colbert C. |title=Middle East Patterns: Places, Peoples, and Politics |publisher=Westview Press |year=2000 |pages=7}}</ref>

===Criticism and usage===
Many have criticized the term ''Middle East'' for what they see as [[Eurocentrism]], because it was originally used by Europeans (although Mahan was American) and reflects the geographical position of the region from a European perspective.<ref>{{cite web |author=Shohat, Ella |title=Redrawing American Cartographies of Asia |url= http://commposite.uqam.ca/videaz/docs/elshen.html |publisher=City University of New York |accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Hanafi, Hassan |title=The Middle East, in whose world? |url=http://www.smi.uib.no/pao/hanafi.html |publisher=Nordic Society for Middle Eastern Studies |accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref>  Today, the term is used by Europeans and non-Europeans alike, unlike the similar term ''[[Mashreq]]'', used exclusively in Arabic-language contexts.<ref>{{cite book |author=Anderson, Ewan W., William Bayne Fisher |title=The Middle East: Geography and Geopolitics |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |pages=12<U+2013>13}}</ref>

The description ''Middle'' has also led to some confusion over changing definitions. Before the [[World War I|First World War]], "Near East" was used in English to refer to the [[Balkans]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], while "Middle East" referred to [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], and Central Asia, [[Turkestan]], and the [[Caucasus]]. In contrast, "Far East" referred to the countries of [[East Asia]] (e.g. China, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, etc.). Some critics usually advise using an alternative term, such as "Western Asia." The official [[UN]] designation of the area is "Western Asia".{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

With the disappearance of the Ottoman Empire in 1918, "Near East" largely fell out of common use in English, while "Middle East" came to be applied to the re-emerging countries of the [[Islamic world]]. However, the usage of "Near East" was retained by a variety of academic disciplines, including [[archaeology]] and [[ancient history]], where it describes an area identical to the term ''Middle East'', which is not used by these disciplines (see [[Ancient Near East]]).

The first official use of the term "Middle East" by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] was in the 1957 [[Eisenhower Doctrine]], which pertained to the [[Suez Crisis]]. Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] defined the Middle East as "the area lying between and including [[Libya]] on the west and [[Pakistan]] on the east, [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] on the North and the Arabian peninsula to the south, plus the [[Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]]."<ref name="davison"/> In 1958, the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] explained that the terms "[[Near East]]" and "Middle East" were interchangeable, and defined the region as including only [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Iraq]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], and [[Qatar]].<ref>{{cite news |title='Near East' is Mideast, Washington Explains |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70E10FC3D59127A93C6A81783D85F4C8585F9&scp=1&sq='Near%20East'%20is%20Mideast,%20Washington%20Explains&st=cse |publisher=The New York Times |date=1958-08-14 |accessdate=2009-01-25}}</ref>

The [[Associated Press]] Stylebook says that Near East formerly referred to the farther west countries while Middle East referred to the eastern ones, but that now they are synonymous. It instructs:
<blockquote>Use ''Middle East'' unless ''Near East'' is used by a source in a story. ''Mideast'' is also acceptable, but ''Middle East'' is preferred.<ref>Goldstein, Norm. ''The Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law''. New York: Basic Books, 2004. ISBN 0465004881 p. 156</ref></blockquote>

At the [[United Nations]], the numerous documents and resolutions about the '''Middle East''' are in fact concerned with the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], in particular the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], and, therefore, with the four states of the [[Levant]]. The term '''Near East''' is occasionally heard at the UN when referring to this region.

===Translations===
There are terms similar to "Near East" and "Middle East" in other European languages, but since it is a relative description, the meanings depend on the country and are different from the English terms generally. In [[German language|German]] the term "[[:de:Naher Osten|Naher Osten]]" (Near East) is still in common use (nowadays the term "Mittlerer Osten" is more and more common in press texts translated from English sources, albeit having a distinct meaning) and in [[Russian language|Russian]] [[:ru:<U+0411><U+043B><U+0438><U+0436><U+043D><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0412><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+043A>|<U+0411><U+043B><U+0438><U+0436><U+043D><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0412><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+043A>]] or "Blizhniy Vostok", [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] [[:bg:<U+0411><U+043B><U+0438><U+0437><U+044A><U+043A> <U+0418><U+0437><U+0442><U+043E><U+043A>|<U+0411><U+043B><U+0438><U+0437><U+043A><U+0438><U+044F> <U+0418><U+0437><U+0442><U+043E><U+043A>]], [[Polish language|Polish]] [[:pl:Bliski Wsch<U+00F3>d|Bliski Wsch<U+00F3>d]] or [[Croatian language|Croatian]] [[:hr:Bliski istok|Bliski istok]] (meaning ''Near East'' in all the four Slavic languages) remains as the only appropriate term for the region. However, some languages do have "Middle East" equivalents, such as the [[French language|French]] [[:fr:Moyen-Orient|Moyen-Orient]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[:es:Oriente Medio|Oriente Medio or Medio Oriente]], and the [[Italian language|Italian]] [[:it:Medio Oriente|Medio Oriente]].<ref>In Italian, the expression "Vicino Oriente" (Near East) was also widely used to refer to Turkey, and "Estremo Oriente" (Far East or Extreme East) to refer to all of Asia east of Middle East</ref>.

Perhaps due to the influence of the Western press, the Arabic equivalent of <U+201C>Middle East,<U+201D> <U+201C><U+202B><U+0627><U+0644><U+0634><U+0631><U+0642> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0623><U+0648><U+0633><U+0637><U+202C><U+201D> (<U+201C><em>ash-sharq-l-awsat</em><U+201D>), has become standard usage in the mainstream Arabic press, comprehending the same meaning as the term <U+201C>Middle East<U+201D> in North American and Western European usage. The [[Persian language|Persian]] equivalent for Middle East is <U+062E><U+0627><U+0648><U+0631><U+0645><U+06CC><U+0627><U+0646><U+0647> (''Kh<U+0101>varmiy<U+0101>neh'').

The Middle East lies at the juncture of [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]] and of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. It is the birthplace and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] center of the [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Yezidi]], and in Iran, [[Mithraism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Manichaeism]] and the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith]]. Throughout its history the Middle East has been a major center of world affairs; a strategically, economically, politically, culturally, and religiously sensitive area.

The earliest civilizations, [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt]], originated in the [[Fertile Crescent]] and [[Nile]] Valley regions of the [[ancient Near East]], as well as the civilizations of the [[History of the Levant|Levant]], [[History of Iran|Persia]], and [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The [[Near East]] was first unified under the [[Achaemenid Empire]] followed later by the [[Macedonian Empire]] and later [[Persian Empire|Iranian empires]], namely the [[Arsacid Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid Empire]]s. However, it would be the [[Caliphate|Arab Caliphates]] of the [[Middle Ages]], or [[Islamic Golden Age]], that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant [[Arab|ethnic identity]] that persists today. The Turkic [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] empires would also later dominate the region.

The modern Middle East began after [[World War I]], when the [[Ottoman Empire]], which was allied with the defeated [[Central Powers]], was [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|partitioned]] into a number of separate nations. Other defining events in this transformation included the establishment of [[Israel]] in 1948 and the departure of European powers, notably [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]]. They were supplanted in some part by the rising influence of the [[United States]].

In the 20th century, the region's significant stocks of [[crude oil]] gave it new strategic and economic importance. Mass production of oil began around 1945, with Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates having large quantities of oil.<ref>Goldschmidt (1999), p. 8</ref> Estimated [[Oil reserves#Oil reserves by country|oil reserves]], especially in Saudi Arabia and Iran, are some of the highest in the world, and the international oil cartel [[OPEC]] is dominated by Middle Eastern countries.

During the Cold War, the Middle East was a theater of ideological struggle between the two superpowers: the United States and the Soviet Union, as they competed to influence regional allies. Of course, besides the political reasons there was also the "ideological conflict" between the two systems. Moreover, as Louise Fawcett argues, among many important areas of contention, or perhaps more accurately of anxiety, were, first, the desires of the superpowers to gain strategic advantage in the region, second, the fact that the region contained some two thirds of the world's oil reserves in a context where oil was becoming increasingly vital to the economy of the Western world [...]<ref>Louise, Fawcett. ''International Relations of the Middle East''. (Oxford University Press, New York, 2005)</ref> Within this contextual framework, the United States sought to divert the Arab world from Soviet influence. Throughout the 20th and into the 21st century, the region has experienced both periods of relative peace and tolerance and periods of conflict and war. Current issues include the [[Iraq War]], [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], and the [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iranian nuclear program]].

==Geography==
{{seealso|List of Middle Eastern countries|Geography of Asia}}
The Middle East defines a geographical area, but does not have precisely defined borders.{{Climate in Middle East cities}}

===Climate===
The Middle East is primarily [[arid]] and [[semi-arid]], and can be subject to [[drought]]; nonetheless, there exists vast expanses of forests and fertile valleys. The region consists of [[grassland]]s, [[rangeland]]s, [[desert]]s, and [[mountains]]. [[Water shortage]]s are a problem in many parts of the Middle East, with rapidly growing [[population]]s increasing demands for water, while [[salinization]] and [[pollution]] threaten water supplies.<ref name="ipcc-1997">{{cite book |url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc/regional/index.htm |chapter=Chapter 7: Middle East and Arid Asia |title=IPCC Special Report on The Regional Impacts of Climate Change: An Assessment of Vulnerability |publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) |year=1997}}</ref> Major rivers, including the [[Nile River|Nile]] and the [[Euphrates River|Euphrates]], provide sources for [[irrigation]] water to support [[agriculture]].
[[Image:Sanaa.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Sana'a]], the capital of [[Yemen]], is located in a mountainous region, and is designated a [[World Heritage Site]] for its [[architecture]]]]

There are two wind phenomenons in the Middle East: the ''sharqi'' and the ''[[shamal (wind)|shamal]]''. The ''sharqi'' (or ''sharki'') is a [[wind]] that comes from the south and southeast. It is seasonal, lasting from April to early June, and comes again between late September and November. The winds are dry and dusty, with occasional gusts up to 80 kilometers per hour (50 miles per hour) and often kick up violent sand and dust storms that can carry sand a few thousand meters high, and can close down airports for short periods of time. These winds can last for a full day at the beginning and end of the season, and for several days during the middle of the season. The ''[[Shamal (wind)|shamal]]'' is a summer northwesterly wind blowing over Iraq and the Persian Gulf states (including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait), often strong during the day, but decreasing at night. This weather effect occurs anywhere from once to several times a year.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Muslim World|editor=Taru Bahl, M H Syed|publisher=Anmol Publications|location=New Delhi |date=2003 |pages=20|isbn=9788126114191|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2x4jq4bXrq0C&pg=PA20&dq=%22Sharqi%22+wind&as_brr=3|accessdate=1 February 2009}}</ref>

===Topography===
While Middle East mainly contains areas with low relief, [[Turkey]] [[Iran]], and [[Yemen]] include mountainous terrain. The [[Anatolian Plateau]] is sandwiched between the [[Pontus Mountains]] and [[Taurus Mountains]] in Turkey. [[Mount Ararat]] in Turkey rises to 5,165 meters. The [[Zagros Mountains]] are located in Iran, in areas along its border with Iraq. The Central Plateau of Iran is divided into two [[drainage basin]]s. The northern basin is [[Dasht-e Kavir]] (Great Salt Desert), and [[Dasht-e-Lut]] is the southern basin.

In [[Yemen]], elevations exceed 3,700 meters in many areas, and [[Highland (geography)|highland]] areas extend north along the [[Red Sea]] coast and north into [[Lebanon]]. A [[Geologic fault|fault]]-zone also exists along the Red Sea, with continental [[rifting]] creating [[Trough (geology)|trough]]-like [[topography]] with areas located well-below [[sea level]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.llnl.gov/tid/lof/documents/pdf/235042.pdf |format=PDF|title=Preliminary Definition of Geophysical Regions for the Middle East and North Africa |author=Sweeney, Jerry J., William R. Walter |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}}</ref> The [[Dead Sea]], located on the border between the [[West Bank]], [[Israel]], and [[Jordan]], is situated at 418 m (1371 ft) below sea level, making it the [[Extremes on Earth|lowest point]] on the surface of the [[Earth]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery-detail.asp?name=deadsea |title=ASTER Image Gallery: The Dead Sea |publisher=NASA}}</ref>

A large [[lowland]] belt is located on the [[Arabian Peninsula]], from central [[Iraq]], through [[Saudi Arabia]], and to [[Oman]] and the [[Arabian Sea]]. The [[Euphrates]] and [[Tigris]] rivers cut through the lowland belt in Iraq and flow into the [[Persian Gulf]]. [[Rub' al Khali|Rub'al Kh<U+0101>L<U+012B>]], one of the world's largest sand deserts, spans the southern third of the Arabian Peninsula in Saudi Arabia, parts of Oman, the [[United Arab Emirates]] and Yemen. [[Jebel Akhdar (Oman)|Jebel al Akhdar]] is a small range of mountains located in northeastern Oman, bordering the [[Gulf of Oman]].

===Geology===
[[Image:Cedars in Lebanon.jpg|right|thumb|Cedar forest in winter, located in [[Lebanon]]]]
Three major [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] converge on the Middle East, including the [[African Plate|African]], [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]], and [[Arabian Plate|Arabian]] plates. The boundaries between the tectonic plates make up the [[Azores-Gibraltar Ridge]], extending across [[North Africa]], the [[Red Sea]], and into Iran.<ref name="beaumont-pg22">Beaumont (1988), p. 22</ref> The Arabian Plate is moving northward into the [[Anatolian Plate|Anatolian plate]] (Turkey) at the [[East Anatolian Fault]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/handbooks/arabianpages/mainframe.htm |title=The Arabian Plate |author=Muehlberger, Bill |publisher=NASA, Johnson Space Center}}</ref> and the boundary between the [[Aegean Sea Plate|Aegean]] and Anatolian plate in eastern Turkey is also [[seismic]]ally active.<ref name="beaumont-pg22"/>

===Water resources===
Several major [[aquifer]]s provide [[water]] to large portions of the Middle East. In Saudi Arabia, two large aquifers of [[Palaeozoic]] and [[Triassic]] origins are located beneath the [[Jabal Tuwayq]] mountains and areas west to the Red Sea.<ref name="beaumont-86">Beaumont (1988), p. 86</ref> [[Cretaceous]] and [[Eocene]]-origin aquifers are located beneath large portions of central and eastern Saudi Arabia, including Wasia and Biyadh which contain amounts of both [[fresh water]] and [[saline water]].<ref name="beaumont-86"/> The [[Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System|Nubian aquifer]] system underlies large areas of North Africa.<ref name="beaumont-86"/> The [[Great Manmade River]] project in [[Libya]] utilizes an extensive network of [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] to transport water from the Nubian aquifer to its population centers. [[Groundwater recharge]] for these deep rock aquifers is on the order of thousands of years, thus the aquifers are essentially [[non-renewable resources]].<ref name="beaumont-85">Beaumont (1988), p. 85</ref> Flood or furrow irrigation, as well as sprinkler methods, are extensively used for [[irrigation]], covering nearly 90,000 km<U+00B2> across the Middle East for agriculture.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fao.org/AG/agl/AGLW/aquastat/regions/neast/index6.stm |title=Water managed areas and irrigation |title=Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)}}</ref>

==Demographics==
===Ethnic groups===
{{main|Ethnic groups of the Middle East}}
[[Image:Ede ethnic groups.jpg|250px|thumb|Various ethnic and religious types in the Middle East, 19th century]]

The Middle East is home to numerous [[ethnic groups]], including [[Arab]]s, [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Jew]]s, [[Kurds]], [[Aramean Syriacs]], [[Azeris]], [[Circassians]], [[Berber people|Berber]]s, [[Somali people|Somalis]], [[Greeks]], [[Samaritans]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmens]], [[Pashtuns]], [[Baluch]], [[Habesha]](mainly Eritrean habesha), and [[Nubians]].

===Religions===
{{main|Religion in the Middle East|Christianity in the Middle East}}

The Middle East is very diverse when it comes to [[religions]], most of which originated there. [[Islam]] in its many forms is by far the largest religion in the Middle East, but other faiths, such as [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], are also important. There are also important minority religions like [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>]], [[Yazdanism]], [[Zoroastrianism]].

===Languages===
Languages of the Middle East span many different families, including [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]], and [[Altaic languages|Altaic]].

[[Arabic language|Arabic]] in its [[Varieties of Arabic|numerous varieties]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] are most widely spoken in the region, with Arabic being the most widely spoken language in the Arab countries. Other languages spoken in the region include [[Russian language|Russian]] is a popular language in many middle eastern country's. , [[Syriac]] (a form of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]), [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]], [[Berber languages]], [[Circassian]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Gilaki language]] and [[Mazandarani language]]s, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in its [[Jewish languages|numerous varieties]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Luri]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and other [[Turkic languages]], [[Somali language|Somali]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].  In Turkey, [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Dimli]] (or Zaza), [[Azeri]], [[Kabardian]], and [[Gagauz]] languages are spoken, in addition to the [[Turkish language]]. Several [[modern South Arabian languages]] are also spoken.

[[English language|English]] is also spoken, especially among the [[middle class|middle]] and [[upper class]], in countries such as [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Israel]], [[Iraq]], and [[Kuwait]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/jo.html#People |title=World Factbook - Jordan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ku.html |title=World Factbook - Kuwait}}</ref> [[French language|French]] is spoken in Algeria, Israel, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, and Egypt. [[Urdu]] is spoken in many Middle Eastern countries, such as Arab states the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and Qatar, which have large numbers of [[Pakistan]]i immigrants. The largest [[Romanian language|Romanian]]-speaking community in the Middle East is found in [[Israel]], where {{as of|1995|lc=on}} Romanian is spoken by 5% of the population.<ref>According to the 1993 ''Statistical Abstract of Israel'' there were 250,000 Romanian speakers in Israel, at a population of 5,548,523 (census 1995).</ref><ref>[http://www.eurojewcong.org/ejc/news.php?id_article=110 Reports of about 300,000 Jews that left the country after WW2]</ref> Romanian is spoken mostly as a secondary language by people from Arab-speaking countries that made their studies in [[Romania]]. It is estimated that almost half a million Middle Eastern [[Arabs]] studied in Romania during the 1980s.<ref>[http://www.evz.ro/article.php?artid=185041 Evenimentul Zilei]</ref> [[Russian language]] is also spoken by a large portion of the Israeli population, due to emigration in the late 1990s.

==Economy==

{{main|Economy of the Middle East}}

Middle Eastern economies range from nations being very poor (such as Gaza and Yemen) to extremely wealthy nations (such as UAE and Saudi Arabia). Overall, {{as of|2007|lc=on}}, according to the CIA World Factbook, all nations in the Middle East are maintaining a positive rate of growth.

According to the [[International Monetary Fund]]'s World Economic Outlook Database of April 2008, the three largest Middle Eastern economies in 2007 were Turkey ($ 663,419,000,000),  Saudi Arabia ($ 376,029,000,000) and Iran ($ 294,089,000,000) in terms of [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|Nominal GDP]]<ref>IMF, World Economic Outlook Database, April 2008: Nominal GDP list of countries in 2007: [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2008/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2007&ey=2007&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=512%2C446%2C914%2C666%2C612%2C668%2C614%2C672%2C311%2C946%2C213%2C137%2C911%2C962%2C193%2C674%2C122%2C676%2C912%2C548%2C313%2C556%2C419%2C678%2C513%2C181%2C316%2C682%2C913%2C684%2C124%2C273%2C339%2C921%2C638%2C948%2C514%2C943%2C218%2C686%2C963%2C688%2C616%2C518%2C223%2C728%2C516%2C558%2C918%2C138%2C748%2C196%2C618%2C278%2C522%2C692%2C622%2C694%2C156%2C142%2C624%2C449%2C626%2C564%2C628%2C283%2C228%2C853%2C924%2C288%2C233%2C293%2C632%2C566%2C636%2C964%2C634%2C182%2C238%2C453%2C662%2C968%2C960%2C922%2C423%2C714%2C935%2C862%2C128%2C716%2C611%2C456%2C321%2C722%2C243%2C942%2C248%2C718%2C469%2C724%2C253%2C576%2C642%2C936%2C643%2C961%2C939%2C813%2C644%2C199%2C819%2C184%2C172%2C524%2C132%2C361%2C646%2C362%2C648%2C364%2C915%2C732%2C134%2C366%2C652%2C734%2C174%2C144%2C328%2C146%2C258%2C463%2C656%2C528%2C654%2C923%2C336%2C738%2C263%2C578%2C268%2C537%2C532%2C742%2C944%2C866%2C176%2C369%2C534%2C744%2C536%2C186%2C429%2C925%2C178%2C746%2C436%2C926%2C136%2C466%2C343%2C112%2C158%2C111%2C439%2C298%2C916%2C927%2C664%2C846%2C826%2C299%2C542%2C582%2C443%2C474%2C917%2C754%2C544%2C698%2C941&s=NGDPD&grp=0&a=&pr.x=63&pr.y=7]</ref>; and Turkey ($ 887,964,000,000), Iran ($ 752,967,000,000) and Saudi Arabia ($ 564,561,000,000) in terms of [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|GDP-PPP]].<ref>IMF, World Economic Outlook Database, April 2008: GDP-PPP list of countries in 2007: [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2008/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2007&ey=2007&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=512%2C446%2C914%2C666%2C612%2C668%2C614%2C672%2C311%2C946%2C213%2C137%2C911%2C962%2C193%2C674%2C122%2C676%2C912%2C548%2C313%2C556%2C419%2C678%2C513%2C181%2C316%2C682%2C913%2C684%2C124%2C273%2C339%2C921%2C638%2C948%2C514%2C943%2C218%2C686%2C963%2C688%2C616%2C518%2C223%2C728%2C516%2C558%2C918%2C138%2C748%2C196%2C618%2C278%2C522%2C692%2C622%2C694%2C156%2C142%2C624%2C449%2C626%2C564%2C628%2C283%2C228%2C853%2C924%2C288%2C233%2C293%2C632%2C566%2C636%2C964%2C634%2C182%2C238%2C453%2C662%2C968%2C960%2C922%2C423%2C714%2C935%2C862%2C128%2C716%2C611%2C456%2C321%2C722%2C243%2C942%2C248%2C718%2C469%2C724%2C253%2C576%2C642%2C936%2C643%2C961%2C939%2C813%2C644%2C199%2C819%2C184%2C172%2C524%2C132%2C361%2C646%2C362%2C648%2C364%2C915%2C732%2C134%2C366%2C652%2C734%2C174%2C144%2C328%2C146%2C258%2C463%2C656%2C528%2C654%2C923%2C336%2C738%2C263%2C578%2C268%2C537%2C532%2C742%2C944%2C866%2C176%2C369%2C534%2C744%2C536%2C186%2C429%2C925%2C178%2C746%2C436%2C926%2C136%2C466%2C343%2C112%2C158%2C111%2C439%2C298%2C916%2C927%2C664%2C846%2C826%2C299%2C542%2C582%2C443%2C474%2C917%2C754%2C544%2C698%2C941&s=PPPGDP&grp=0&a=&pr.x=48&pr.y=17]</ref> When it comes to per capita (PPP) based income, the three highest ranking countries are Qatar ($80,900), Kuwait ($39,300) and the United Arab Emirates ($37,300). The lowest ranking country in the Middle East, in terms of per capita income (PPP) is the autonomous Palestinian Authority of Gaza and the West Bank ($1,100).

The economic structure of Middle Eastern nations are different in the sense that while some nations are heavily dependent on export of only oil and oil-related products (such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait), others have a highly diverse economic base (such as Turkey and Egypt). Industries of the Middle Eastern region includes oil and oil-related products, agriculture, cotton, cattle, dairy, textiles, leather products, surgical instruments, defence equipment (guns, ammunition, tanks, submarines, fighter jets, UAVs, and missiles). Banking is also an important sector of the economies especially in the case of UAE, and Bahrain. Tourism, with the exception of Turkey and Egypt, remains largely unexplored and is underdeveloped due to the conservative nature of the region as well as the political turmoil in certain regions of the Middle East. In recent years, however, countries such as the UAE, Bahrain, and Jordan have begun experiencing greater number of tourists due to improving tourist facilities and the relaxing of tourism-related policies.

Unemployment is notably high in the Middle East and North Africa region, particularly among young people aged 15-29, a demographic representing 30% of the region<U+2019>s total population.
