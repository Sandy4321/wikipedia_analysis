==2001 incident== 
In Kaye's early days in the tour, he was known to occasionally find himself in the center of sports media attention for his unorthodox behavior. Kaye's most well known clash with the Tour came at the [[2001]] [[Michelob Championship]] at [[Kingsmill Golf Club]], played less than a month after [[9/11]]. The co-leader after a the second round, Kaye was heading to the locker room. As the story goes, a security guard refused him entry without his player ID badge, which Kaye then found and clipped provocatively to the zipper of his pants. The guard took offense, and PGA Tour [[commissioner]] [[Tim Finchem]] suspended Kaye for two months. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The Tour considers the incident so taboo that neither Kaye nor the security guard are allowed to talk about it. However, Kaye has unwittingly given himself, as well as the Tour, positive attention by being a distinct personality among the other golfers.
