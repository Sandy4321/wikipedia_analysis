'''Nicholas St. Lawrence, 9th Baron Howth''' (c.1550<U+2013>1607) was a leading member of the [[Anglo-Irish]] nobility in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Despite openly admitting his [[Roman Catholic]] faith, he enjoyed the trust of [[Elizabeth 1]] and successive Lord Deputies of Ireland, and was even excused for signing a petition against the [[Penal Laws]].

== Early life ==
He was the eldest surviving son of [[Christopher St Lawrence, 8th Baron Howth (d. 1589)|Christopher, 8th Baron Howth]] and his first wife Elizabeth Plunket. His date of birth is often given as 1555, but was probably some years earlier: Elrington Ball states that he was well into middle age when his father died,<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''History of Dublin'' 6 Volumes Alexander Thoms and Co.  Dublin 1902<U+2013>1920</ref> and in 1605 he was described as being  "too old to live long".

His early life cannot have been happy: his father was notorious for  his cruelty to his wife and children. In 1577 Nicholas' teenage sister Jane died after being severely  beaten by her father and his mother was so ill-treated that the [[Court of Castle Chamber]] eventually granted her a  [[judicial separation]].<ref>Crawford, Jon G.  ''A Star Chamber Court in  Ireland- the Court of Castle Chamber'' 1571<U+2013>1641 Four Courts Press Dublin 2006</ref>

According to a well-known legend [[Granuaile]], the celebrated Pirate Queen of Galway in about 1575 arrived unannounced at [[Howth Castle]] for dinner, only to find the gates barred; in retaliation for the discourtesy she took the youthful heir  hostage until the family apologised. Elrington Ball argues that the story may be based on fact<ref>''History of Dublin''</ref>- but if the heir was a child this would refer to Nicholas' eldest son, not Nicholas himself. 

In the 1580s he lived mostly at Platten in [[County Meath|Meath]] where his wife had inherited property from her first husband. He was [[knighted]] in 1588 and succeeded his father  as  baron the following year.

== Political career ==
In Elrington Ball's view Lord Howth  "was devoted to the interests of [[the Pale]] and did not always find it easy to reconcile that with the requirements of Government"<ref>''History of Dublin''</ref> especially after it became clear that he was loyal to the Roman Catholic religion. Initial relations with the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], [[William FitzWilliam (Lord Deputy)|Sir William FitzWilliam]], were friendly, and he was appointed guardian of the Pale in the Deputy's absence. Shortly afterwards relations  between the two men cooled when Nicholas became involved in the long and bitter [[feud]] between the Nugent and Dillon families family, headed by [[Christopher Nugent|Christopher, Baron Delvin]] on the one hand and Sir [[Robert Dillon (judge)|Robert Dillon]], the [[Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas]] on the other. The Nugent family pursued Dillon relentlessly with charges of corruption for several years until he was eventually cleared in 1593, and Lord Howth was closely associated with the attack.<ref name="DNB">{{cite DNB|last=Dunlop|first=Robert|wstitle=St. Lawrence, Nicholas|volume=50}}</ref> His motives are unclear; Lord Delvin claimed  that Howth had been injured by the Deputy, but Howth himself proclaimed his trust in him. More likely he was influenced by his second wife's father, Sir [[Nicholas White]], another bitter enemy of Dillon, and this would explain his loss of favour with the Crown, since White's loyalty was deeply suspect, and he eventually died a prisoner in the [[Tower of London]].

Howth was restored to favour and enjoyed friendly relations with the new Deputy, [[William Russell, 1st Baron Russell of Thornhaugh|Lord Russell]], whom he entertained at Howth Castle  on his arrival in Ireland. The following year he accompanied Russell on his campaign against the O'Byrnes of [[Wicklow]] and the Deputy wrote that Howth deserved some words of thanks from the Queen.<ref name="DNB"/> In 1598 he was praised highly for being one of the few nobles of [[the Pale]] to render useful assistance to Sir [[Henry Bagenal]] in his campaign against [[Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone|Hugh O'Neill]], although he later complained of the depredations of Bagenal's soldiers in the Pale.<ref name="DNB"/>

In 1600 he was again the first to entertain a new  Lord Deputy, [[Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy]], who formed a very high opinion of him and appointed him to act as Deputy in his absence.
In 1601 he went to London to discuss Irish affairs: the Queen who had already met and been impressed by his eldest son, also formed a high opinion of Howth himself.<ref>Ball  ''History of Dublin''</ref> On his return he was appointed to the [[Privy Council of Ireland]].

== Religious conflict ==
Howth's first wife  Margaret was a daughter of Sir [[Christopher Barnewall]] of Turvey, who while outwardly conforming to the [[Church of Ireland]],  had  privately adhered to the Roman  Catholic faith. Christopher's son [[Patrick Barnewall (died 1622)|Patrick Barnewall]] emerged in the early 1600s as spokesman for the Catholic nobility. Although they had been on bad terms over a lawsuit in the 1590s, he and Howth became friendly  and Howth, like Barnewall, openly admitted his Catholic faith. In December 1605 he was one of the signatories to a petition that the [[Penal Laws]] should  be modified, rather than extended.<ref name="DNB"/> This was potentially a dangerous step, and Barnewall was sent to the [[Tower of London]] as a result, but Howth was left in peace. He enjoyed the confidence of yet another Deputy, Sir [[Arthur Chichester]], who was said to openly dispute with him the rival merits of the two faiths (this is  rather surprising in view of Chichester's generally vigorous enforcement of the [[Penal Laws]]). Possibly to forestall any action against Howth, Chichester wrote that he was old and would not live long.<ref>Ball ''History of Dublin''</ref> This proved to be correct: Howth died in May 1607 and was buried in Howth Abbey.

== Family ==
By his first wife Margaret, daughter of Sir Christophe Barnewall, he had three children:
*[[Christopher St Lawrence, 10th Baron Howth]]
*Thomas
*Mary, who married William Eustace of [[Castlemartin House and Estate|Castlemartin]].

By his second wife Mary White, daughter of Sir [[Nicholas White]], [[Master of the Rolls in Ireland]] he had six further children:
*Richard
*Almeric
*Edward
*Margaret, who married firstly Jenico Preston, 5th [[Viscount Gormanston]] and secondly [[Luke Plunkett, 1st Earl of Fingall]]
*Eleanor
*Alison, who married Thomas Luttrell.
