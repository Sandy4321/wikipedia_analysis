"'''When I Look at You'''" is a [[power ballad]] performed by American recording artist and actress [[Miley Cyrus]]. The song was written by [[Hillary Lindsey]] and [[John Shanks]] and produced by Shanks. It was released on March 1, 2010 by [[Hollywood Records]] as the second [[single (music)|single]] from Cyrus' first extended play, ''[[The Time of Our Lives (EP)|The Time of Our Lives]]'' (2009). A remix version titled "Te Miro a Ti", featuring Spanish singer [[David Bisbal]] was released later; in it, Cyrus sings her lines in English, while Bisbal's are mingled in both English and Spanish. "When I Look at You" was featured on the 2010 film ''[[The Last Song (film)|The Last Song]]'' and its corresponding soundtrack, being used to promote the film. The song contains an [[instrumentation]] primarily based on [[piano]], while its lyrics speak of a dream boy.

"When I Look at You" received average to mixed critical reception and was unable to duplicate the commercial success of Cyrus' previous single, "[[Party in the U.S.A.]]" "When I Look at You" peaked at number sixteen on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and charted within the top thirty on charts in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. The song's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by [[Adam Shankman]]. It features Cyrus playing a grand piano throughout several settings, including a beach and forest. Two other versions of the video were released: one replacing several scenes with clips from ''The Last Song'' and another featuring Bisbal. Cyrus performed the song in multiple venues, including on her first world tour, the [[Wonder World Tour]] (2009).

==Background==
"When I Look at You" was written by [[Hillary Lindsey]] and [[John Shanks]].<ref name="linernotes" /> It is used to promote the 2010 film ''[[The Last Song (film)|The Last Song]]'', in which Cyrus stars as Veronica "Ronnie" Miller, an angry, rebellious seventeen year old forced to spend a summer with her estranged father.

The song was initially to be included on Cyrus second studio album, ''[[Can't Be Tamed]]'', but was then used for ''The Last Song'' because it fit the film's concept well.<ref name="abcfamily">{{cite web|url=http://community.abcfamily.go.com/watch/music/exclusive-first-look-making-miley-cyrus-when-i-look-you|title=Exclusive First Look: "The Making of Miley Cyrus" "When I Look at You"|work=''[[ABC Family]]''|publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]]|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}</ref> According to Cyrus, when she sings "When I Look at You", she thinks of family and love.

The [[music video]] for "When I Look at You" was directed by [[Adam Shankman]], producer of ''The Last Song''. The video was filmed on August 16, 2009 in several outdoor settings in [[Savannah, Georgia]].<ref name="savannah">{{cite web|title=Savannah, 'The Last Song' featured in Miley Cyrus music video |work=[[Savannah Morning News]]|publisher=[[Morris Communications]]|date=September 12, 2009|url=http://savannahnow.com/accent/2009-09-12/savannah-last-song-featured-miley-cyrus-music-video|accessdate=January 11, 2010}}</ref> "The premise of the video for 'When I Look at You' is to put together the relationships between Miley, the piano, and music, her relationship with Liam, her relationship to the song", Shankman commented, in regards to the video's concept.<ref name="abcfamily" /> He believed Cyrus and Hemsworth had "great chemistry" while filming ''The Last Song'' and brought it into the set of the video.<ref name="abcfamily" /> The video opens by showing a black grand piano alone on a [[pier]], which transitions to a close-up of Cyrus with her wavy hair styled loose. She is shown playing the in a long white dress. Australian actor [[Liam Hemsworth]], who portrays Will Blakelee in ''The Last Song'', appears next to the piano, Cyrus not being present. Throughout the rest of the video, Cyrus sings and plays the piano in a forest, the beach, and a mansion's front yard. Cut-scenes feature Cyrus and Hemsworth interacting romantically, at one point kissing in a wheat field. The video ends by, again, showing the piano alone in the pier. Two alternate versions of the music video were later released: one replaces the cut-scenes of Cyrus and Hemsworth with clips from ''The Last Song'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://disney.go.com/videos/#/videos/musicvideos/&content=1118375|title=When I Look at You music video|work=''[[Disney.com]]''|publisher=The Walt Disney Company|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}</ref> and another for the song's remix featuring Bisbal.<ref name="bisbalvideo" /> The latter version replaces cut-scenes with shots of Bisbal signing in a forest and beach; his scenes were directed by Marc Roussel.<ref name="bisbalvideo" />

The video was officially premiered on February 21, 2010 on [[ABC Family]],<ref name="abcfamily" /> but was previously leaked to the Internet on September 11, 2009.<ref name="savannah" /> Jocelyn Vena of MTV News congratulated Shankman for capturing romance in the video. She further commented, "Cyrus is definitely growing up, something she's wanted to prove to the world for a while now. And although there's nothing particularly jarring in the clip, the vibe shows that Cyrus is most certainly ready to leave ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' behind."<ref name="videoreview" /> Jefferson Reid of [[E!]] review the version where clips from the film are used, and said the clips made production values high, "but also helping to keep things easy on the eyes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b168130_new_vid_last_song_miley_cyrus_when_i.html|title=New Vid, Last Song: Miley Cyrus, "When I Look at You"|first=Jefferson|last=Reid|date=February 20, 2010|work=''[[E!]]''|publisher=[[Comcast]]|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}</ref>
