'''German submarine ''U-104''''' was a [[German Type IX submarine#Type IXB|Type IXB]] [[U-boat]] of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' during [[World War II]]. ''U-104'' was ordered by the ''Kriegsmarine'' on 24 May 1938 as part of the German naval rearmament program [[Plan Z]]. Her keel was laid down by [[AG Weser]] in [[Bremen]] on 10 November 1939. Following about six and a half months of construction, she was launched on 25 May 1940 and formally commissioned into the ''Kriegsmarine'' on 19 August 1940 under the command of Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant [[Harald J<U+00FC>rst]].

''U-104'' had a very short career and sank only one enemy vessel and damaged a further one during one war patrol. In the middle of her first patrol, ''U-104'' went missing off of the north coast of [[Ireland]] on 28 November 1940 and was presumed sunk in minefield SN 44, which was laid down a few days prior to ''U-104''{{'}}s arrival in the area.

''U-104'' was ordered  by the German ''Kriegsmarine'' on 24 May 1938 (as part of Plan Z and in violation of the Treaty of Versailles). Her keel was laid down on 10 November 1939 by [[AG Weser]] in [[Bremen]] as ''Werk 967''. ''U-104'' was launched on 25 May 1940 and commissioned on 19 August of that year under the command of Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant Harald J<U+00FC>rst.<ref name="uboatnet"/>

Like all Type IXB submarines, ''U-104'' had  a total output of {{convert|1000|hp|0|abbr=on}} while submerged and {{convert|4400|hp|0|abbr=on}} when surfaced. As a result, she could travel at {{convert|18.3|kn|km/h}} while surfaced and {{convert|7.3|kn|km/h}} while submerged. ''U-104'' had a range of {{convert|22200|nmi|km|lk=on|abbr=on}} at {{convert|10|kn|km/h}} while on the surface and {{convert|118|nmi|km|abbr=on}} at {{convert|4|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} while submerged.  She was equipped with 6 torpedo tubes (4 in the bow, 2 in the stern) and carried a total of 22 {{convert|533|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} torpedoes. The submarine was also equipped with 44 TMA mines. ''U-104''{{'}}s main [[deck gun]] was a ''Utof'' 105 mm/45 with a magazine of 110 rounds. ''U-104'' also carried the standard [[2 cm FlaK 30]] anti-aircraft guns. She had a crew of 49 men and could carry up to 56 crew members at any given time. After being commissioned and deployed, ''U-104'' was stationed in the German port city of [[Wilhelmshaven]].<ref name=Type/><ref name=Aces/>

==Service history==
During her short career, ''U-104'' sank one enemy vessel and damaged another on her first and only war patrol in the [[North Sea]], off of the northern coast of Ireland and Great Britain.<ref name=uboatnet/> ''U-104'' went to sea on her first and only war patrol on 12 November 1940. For a period of 17 days, ''U-104'' roamed the [[North Sea]] and eventually the northern coast of Scotland and Ireland in search of any Allied convoys heading to Great Britain. During that time she attacked two enemy vessels, sinking one and damaging the other.<ref name=Patrol1/> On 27 November 1940, ''U-104'' torpedoed the British merchant vessel ''Diplomat''. She soon sank with the loss of 14 of her crew.<ref name=Diplomat>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/677.html|title=Diplomat (Steam merchant)|last=Helgason|first=Gu<U+00F0>mundur|work=Ships hit by U-boats|publisher=Uboat.net |accessdate=8 June 2010}}</ref> The other merchant vessel to be attacked by ''U-104'' on that day was the British motor tanker ''Charles F. Meyer'', which managed to survive the attack. The next day, ''U-104'' went missing just north of neutral Ireland. She is presumed to have been sunk by a mine from the SN 44 minefield, which was laid on 8 November 1940, just 20 days prior to ''U-104''{{'}}s disappearance.<ref name=Patrol1>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/boats/patrols/patrol_3703.html|title=Patrol info for U-104 (First patrol)|last=Helgason|first=Gu<U+00F0>mundur|work=U-boat patrols|publisher=Uboat.net |accessdate=8 June 2010}}</ref> All of her crew are presumed dead.<ref name="uboatnet"/>
