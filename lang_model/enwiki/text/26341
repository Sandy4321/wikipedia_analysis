'''Herbert Jackson Youngblood, III''' (born January 26, 1950) is a former American college and professional [[American football|football]] player who was a [[defensive end]] for the [[St. Louis Rams|Los Angeles Rams]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for fourteen seasons during the 1970s and 1980s.  He was a five-time consensus [[All-Pro]] and a seven-time Pro Bowl selection and was inducted to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].  Before playing professionally, Youngblood played [[college football]] for the [[University of Florida]], and was recognized as an [[All-American]].  He is considered among the best players Florida ever produced&mdash;a member of the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] and one of only five Florida Gators to be named to the [[Gator Football Ring of Honor]].

After retiring as a player in 1985, Youngblood worked in the Rams' front office until 1991.  He also worked in the front office of the [[Sacramento Surge]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) from 1992 to 1993, and the administration of the CFL's [[Sacramento Gold Miners]] from 1993 to 1994.  He was a vice-president, then president, of the [[Orlando Predators]] from 1995 until 1999.  From 1999 through 2002, he served as the NFL's liaison for the [[Arena Football League (1987<U+2013>2008)|Arena Football League]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?Category=27&ID=2151&r=0&subCategoryID= |title= Youngblood contributes to Arena League success|accessdate=2008-08-21 |last= Popvich|first= Mike|coauthors= |date= |work=CantonRep.com |publisher=}}</ref>

Youngblood has made forays into broadcasting (both radio and television), acting, and business, and has written an autobiography.  He was a popular spokesperson for various products, and he has been consistently involved in charity work, starting in college, continuing throughout his NFL career, and remaining so today.  Currently, Youngblood serves on the NFLPA [[John Mackey (American football)|Mackey]]-[[Reggie White|White]] Traumatic Brain Injury Committee.<ref>Associated Press, "[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4860755  Mackey-White Traumatic Brain Injury Committee Committee holds first meeting]," ESPN.com (January 26, 2010).

==Early years==
Jack Youngblood was born in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], the son of Herbert J. and Kay Youngblood. He has two sisters, Paula and Lynn. Youngblood attended Monticello-Jefferson County High School in [[Monticello, Florida]], graduating in 1967. As an offensive lineman and linebacker, he was a starter on offense and defense and team captain of the state champion Tigers, earning All-State honors in 1966 after recording 70 tackles.<ref name="all-state">{{cite web |url=http://www.fhsaa.org/news/2007/1212|title= FHSAA announces 33-member All-Century football team

He was a four-year letterman in football and also played basketball at M-JC High as well as participating in 4-H, Student Council and [[Key Club]] International.

Youngblood was named to Florida's All-Time High school football team by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' in 1989.  In November 2007, he was recognized as one of the state of Florida's thirty-three all-time greatest high school football players when he was voted to the [[Florida High School Athletic Association]]'s [[FHSAA's All-Century Team|All-Century High School football team]].<ref name="all-state"/>

==College career==
At the [[University of Florida]], Youngblood earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[finance]], was a brother of the [[Alpha Tau Omega]] [[Fraternities and sororities|Fraternity]] (Alpha Omega Chapter),<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ato.org/av/gi_famous.shtml |title= Famous Alumni|accessdate=2008-08-21 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= ato.org|publisher=Alpha Tau Omega}}</ref> and was a three-year varsity [[letterman (sports)|letterman]] for coach [[Ray Graves]] and coach [[Doug Dickey]]'s [[Florida Gators football]] teams from [[1968 Florida Gators football team|1968]] to [[1970 Florida Gators football team|1970]].<ref name=ufmediaguide>''[http://web.gatorzone.com/football/media/2011/media_guide.pdf  2011 Florida Gators Football Media Guide]'', University Athletic Association, Gainesville, Florida, pp. 83, 87, 91, 96, 102&ndash;103, 186 (2011).  Retrieved September 1, 2011.</ref>  Youngblood had entered school at 195 pounds and put on 10 pounds a year through weight-lifting, finishing around 245 pounds.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.collegefootball.org/famersearch.php?id=60041|title= College Football Hall of Fame|accessdate=2009-02-07 |work= |publisher= |date= }}</ref> Youngblood and his teammates were part of the testing of what became [[Gatorade]], a beverage created by Doctors [[Robert Cade]] and Dana Shires, designed to help Gator athletes who had to practice and play in Central Florida heat. Said Youngblood, "Dr. Cade began experimenting with Gatorade my freshman year. He tried to kill us all! That first stuff was lethal! It was thick, like syrup, and had an aftertaste. Then, it started to look like milk.<U+2033><ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/1581826214 |title= Gators Glory: Great Eras in Florida Football|isbn=1581826214|publisher=Cumberland House Publishing|page=236 |year=2007|last=Sharpe|first=Wilton}}</ref>

As a freshman Youngblood played defensive end, wearing number 52, for the Gator freshman team. It was his first experience on the defensive line, after playing linebacker in high school. As a sophomore, Youngblood played defensive end and defensive tackle while also handling the kicking chores for the Gators, kicking a career-long 42-yard field goal to provide the three-point winning margin in his first collegiate game which was against [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force]].

In [[1969 Florida Gators football team|1969]], Youngblood was part of a 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 Gators team that upset the [[Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee Volunteers]] in the [[Gator Bowl]] in [[Ray Graves]]'s final game as coach at Florida. Youngblood played a key role in the [[Florida<U+2013>Tennessee rivalry#1969 Gator Bowl|Gator Bowl]] recording nine tackles and forcing a fumble.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Greatest Moments of Florida Gators Football|pages=73<U+2013>75 |last= Editors of The Gainsville Sun |first= |coauthor= |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=FXabX0BP7xIC&pg=PA73&dq=jack+youngblood+gator+bowl&sig=X9Z9Aqie2oGZaJK5TB7aNjfyU9c |isbn=9781571671967|publisher= Sports Publishing LLC |year=1998}}</ref> Youngblood first gained national attention after an October 4, 1969, 5-sack performance 21-6 win versus instate rival [[Florida<U+2013>Florida State rivalry#1969 - Cappleman Crunch|Florida State University]].

In 1970, Youngblood was voted [[1970 College Football All-America Team|All-American]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gatorzone.com/football/media/2006/pdf/128-135.pdf|title= Florida All-Americans|accessdate=2008-01-05 |format= PDF|work= gatorzone.com|publisher= University of Florida}}</ref> while recording 58 tackles and leading the team with 10 sacks to finish his Gator career with 29 quarterback sacks. Additionally, he was a finalist for the [[Outland Trophy]] following the 1970 season<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gatorzone.com/football/media/2006/pdf/143-146.pdf|title= 100 Years of Gator Football|accessdate=2008-01-05 |format= PDF|work= gatorzone.com|publisher=University of Florida}}</ref> and was voted the 1970 [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] lineman of the year. Youngblood was also named to the SEC All-Conference team in 1970, which ended three winning seasons while at Florida. He was also the 1970 recipient of Florida's [[Fergie Ferguson Award]], which goes to the senior who displays outstanding leadership, character, and courage.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gatorzone.com/football/media/2006/pdf/143-146.pdf|title=2006 Gator Football Media Guide|accessdate=2007-08-21 |work= Gator Report|date= }}</ref> His performance in the Florida&ndash;Georgia rivalry earned him a spot in the [[Florida&ndash;Georgia football rivalry#Florida&ndash;Georgia Hall of Fame|Florida&ndash;Georgia Game Hall of Fame]] as well.<ref name="SECbest">{{cite web |url= http://www.secsportsfan.com/top-all-time-sec-defensive-football-player.html|title= Top All-Time SEC Defensive Football Player|accessdate=2008-08-21 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= secsportsfan.com|publisher=SEC Sports Fan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coj.net/Departments/Recreation+and+Community+Services/Special+Events/FlaGa/EVENTS/Hall+of+Fame+Induction+Ceremony.htm|title= Florida-Georgia Hall of Fame inductees|accessdate=2009-02-11 |format= PDF|work=City of Jacksonville, Florida official website|publisher= }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In the 1970 edition of the game, Florida trailed Georgia by seven points and the Georgia offense had driven to Florida's 1-yard line, Youngblood stopped a Georgia running back short of the goal line and forced him to fumble and then recovered the loose ball beginning a rally that gained a come-from-behind 24&ndash;17 victory.<ref name=GatorRing>{{cite web |url= http://gatorzone.com/facilities/?venue=swamp&page=ringofhonor&sport=footb|title= Florida Football Ring of Honor|accessdate=2008-06-19 |work= |date= }}</ref>

Youngblood graduated from the University of Florida with a [[bachelor's degree]] in business administration in 1972.

==NFL career==
Youngblood was drafted by the Los Angeles Rams in the first round of the [[1971 NFL Draft]]. He was the 20th overall pick in that draft and signed a 3-year $105,000 contract including a $30,000 signing bonus.<ref>{{cite book |title=Blood |last=Youngblood |first=Jack |coauthor=Engel, Joel |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0809245884 |isbn=978-0809245888 |page=10 |publisher=McGraw-Hill/Contemporary |year=1988}}</ref> That season he backed up [[Deacon Jones]] at left defensive end and started four games when Jones was sidelined with a severely sprained arch. He was named All-Rookie by ''Football Digest'' and after the season Jones was traded to the San Diego Chargers. In 1972 the left defensive end position was Youngblood's as he led the Rams defensive linemen in tackles with 70, and started 11 of the 14 games he played, recording six sacks.

In 1973 Youngblood was a Second-team All-pro selection and went to the first of his seven Pro Bowls and led the Rams with 16<U+00BD> sacks. The Ram defense led the NFL in fewest yards allowed and fewest rushing yards. He was voted the Rams defensive lineman of the year by the Rams Alumni Association. Beginning in the 1973 season, the Rams added the unrelated [[Jim Youngblood]] to its roster, so from that time on, both Youngbloods had the unique distinction of having their entire name on the back of their jerseys, the given name appearing above the family name. The following year, 1974, the Rams again led the NFL in rushing defense and Youngblood led the Rams with 15 sacks while being voted a consensus First-team All-Pro. The Rams advanced to the NFC Championship game, losing 14-10 to the Minnesota Vikings.

Youngblood was honored as the [[UPI NFC Player of the Year|NFC Defensive Player of the Year]] by [[United Press International]] in 1975 and ''[[Pro Football Weekly]]'' named Youngblood the NFL defensive lineman of the year. For the third consecutive season Youngblood led the Rams in sacks (15) and was a consensus All-pro again, repeating his 1974 honor. In a December, 1975, 35-23 playoff win over the [[Arizona Cardinals|St. Louis Cardinals]], Youngblood pass-rushed Cardinals offensive lineman [[Dan Dierdorf]], penetrated into the backfield, then tipped and intercepted a pass by [[Jim Hart (American football)|Jim Hart]], returning the interception 47 yards for a touchdown. Later in the game, Youngblood forced a fumble that was recovered by teammate [[Fred Dryer]], blocked an extra point attempt, and sacked Hart to stop a Cardinals drive.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/cardinals/articles/2009/01/16/20090116spt-sscardsplayoffs.html |title=

Youngblood repeated his NFC Defensive Player of the Year Award in 1976 while co-leading the Rams in sacks with 14<U+00BD> and being a consensus First-team All-pro for the third straight season. The following year, 1977, Youngblood was voted to his fifth consecutive Pro Bowl and a consensus All-NFC selection and Second-team All-pro while leading the Rams in sacks for the fifth straight season. In 1978 the Rams led the NFL in total defense and Youngblood was a consensus First-team All-Pro for the fourth time in five years.

One of the athletic feats for which Youngblood is best known, is that of playing the entire [[NFL playoffs, 1979-80|1979 playoffs]], including [[Super Bowl XIV]], with a fractured left [[fibula]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.baynews9.com/content/36/2009/1/29/431507.html|title= BN9.com blog: Once the football glory fades|accessdate=2009-02-07 |last= Kuleci Constantine|first= Caitlin|work= Bay News 9|publisher= |date= 2002-01-09}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> He also played in the [[1980 Pro Bowl]] with the injured leg, a week after the Super Bowl.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www2.tbo.com/content/2009/jan/29/s6-against-all-odds-he-played|title= Against All Odds He Played|accessdate=2009-02-07 |work= Tampa Tribune|publisher= |date= 2009-01-28}}</ref> In the playoffs, Youngblood sacked [[Dallas Cowboys]] [[quarterback]] [[Roger Staubach]] near the sideline in the waning moments of the divisional playoff game versus the Cowboys.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url=http://archive.profootballweekly.com/content/archives/features_2000/turney3_012201.asp |last=Turney |first=John |title=So close but...Will Hall of Fame vote be another narrow miss for Youngblood? |work=Pro Football Weekly website |date=January 22, 2001 |accessdate=2008-11-29}}</ref> Playing with the fractured leg was noted by ''Sports Illustrated'' in their Top 10 list of athletes playing in pain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/scorecard/10/19/top10.playing.with.pain/index.html |title=Top 10 Playing With Pain Moments |work=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=October 19, 2004 |accessdate=2008-11-29}}</ref> For that and other achievements Jack was dubbed the <U+201C>John Wayne of football<U+201D> by Jim Hanifan and echoed by Hall of Fame coach [[John Madden (American football)|John Madden]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0515091936&id=5fkygqMiHpcC&q=%22Jack+Youngblood%22&dq=%22Jack+Youngblood%22&pgis=1 |title=One Knee Equals Two Feet |isbn=9780515091939 |coauthor=Anderson, Dave |publisher=Jove Books |page=113 |year=1987 |last=Madden |first=John}}</ref> The [[NFL Network]] series [[NFL Top 10]] selected Youngblood's performance in the 1979 playoffs as top on its list of the <U+201C>Gutsiest Performances<U+2033> of all-time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d807a1f2b&template=with-video&confirm=true |title=NFL's Top 10 kicks off second season on NFL Network |work=NFL Network |date=2008-09-13 |accessdate=2008-11-29}}</ref>

In the off-season, prior to the 1981 season, Jack had emergency surgery to remove a hot-dog sized blood clot from under his left arm.

Youngblood faced a challenge in 1983 when the Rams adopted Shurmer's 3-4 defense. Critics thought Youngblood might be too small to play that position, yet he performed in it well (recording 10<U+00BD> sacks in 1983 and 9<U+00BD> sacks in 1984 while Rams were among the NFL's best defenses at stopping the run) despite being considered undersized.<ref name="McDermott"/> Among the standout games in Youngblood's final two seasons were the opening game of the 1983 season, against the New York Giants in which Youngblood recorded two sacks; and the 1983 season finale against the New Orleans Saints. In the Saints game Youngblood recorded 10 tackles, two sacks, recorded a safety and was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year by [[Pro Football Weekly]] for the effort.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://media.stlouisrams.com/Upload/administration_23994.pdf|title= 2008 St. Louis Rams Media Guide |accessdate=2009-02-09 |work=|publisher= |date= }}</ref> In Week 5 of 1984 against the New York Giants, Youngblood recorded two sacks, drew three holding calls and was named NFC Defensive Player of the Week by the NFL.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://media.stlouisrams.com/Upload/administration_23994.pdf|title= 2002 St. Louis Rams Media Guide |accessdate=2009-02-09 |work=|publisher= |date= }}</ref> Then, in Week 10, against the St. Louis Cardinals, Jack dominated the game sacking Neil Lomax three times and drawing three holding calls, and blocking a potential game-tying field goal on the game's final play to preserve a 16-13 Rams win.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/673601422.html?dids=673601422:673601422&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&date=Nov+05%2C+1984&author=CHRIS+DUFRESNE&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Jumping+Jack+Flash&pqatl=google |title= Jumping Jack Flash - Youngblood Runs Circles Around the Cardinals' Tootie Robbins|accessdate=2009-02-10 |last= Dufrense|first= Chris|coauthors= |date=1984-11-05|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=}}</ref>

His streak of consecutive games played ended in Week 15 of the [[1984 Los Angeles Rams season|1984]] season, when Youngblood had to sit out his first football game since being a collegiate player in 1970. He had suffered a ruptured disc in his lower back two weeks earlier. Despite the injury, he returned for the season finale against the 49ers and the playoffs.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nfl.com/players/gamelogs?id=YOU728550|title= Jack Youngblood 1984 Game Log|accessdate=2008-08-21 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work=NFL.com |publisher=}}</ref> He attributed his ability to play to a series of back adjustments that allowed him more freedom of movement, even though team doctors told Youngblood he was out for the season and needed surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinetrac.com/testimonials.htm |title=SpineTrac - Testimonials |work=SpineTrac website |date= |accessdate=2008-11-29}}</ref> He was voted the Rams' recipient of the 1984 [[Ed Block Courage Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edblock.org/courage_award_alumni.htm |title=Ed Block Courage Award Foundation |work=Ed Block Courage Award Foundation website}}</ref> by <U+201C>representing everything that is positive about professional football and serving as an inspiration in their locker rooms being a positive role model in his communities<U+201D>.

===Autobiography===
In 1988, Youngblood authored (with Joel Engel) his autobiography, ''Blood''. The book outlined Youngblood's drive and passion for professional football and reviewed his career, his injuries, his successes, and his failures on the football field. The book recounts when, between the 1973 and 1974 seasons, Youngblood traveled to Logan, Utah, to help Rams teammates Merlin and Phil Olsen with their summer football camp. An altercation in the parking lot of a local pub resulted in Youngblood having a .44 pistol stuck in his eye and the trigger pulled and fortunately the chamber was empty, although other chambers were not. A cut eyelid was the only injury he sustained. After initially pleading innocent, the assailant later pled guilty and received a one-year suspended sentence.<ref>{{cite book |title=Blood |pages=147<U+2013>148 |last=Youngblood |first=Jack |coauthor=Engel, Joel |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0809245884 |isbn=978-0809245888 |publisher=McGraw-Hill/Contemporary |year=1988}}</ref> The book was favorably reviewed by [[Publishers Weekly]] as <U+201C>an unusual sports book<U+2033>.<ref>{{cite book|url= http://www.amazon.com/dp/0809245884 |title=Publishers Weekly |isbn=|publisher= Reed Business Information, Inc. |year=1988|last=|first=}}</ref>

His highest single-season sack total was 18 in 1979.

He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001 along with [[Ron Yary]], [[Lynn Swann]], Jackie Slater, [[Mike Munchak]], [[Marv Levy]], and [[Nick Buoniconti]] and inducted in August in Canton, Ohio.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.profootballweekly.com/content/archives2001/features_2001/halloffame_073001.asp |title=Class of 2001: Pro Football Hall of Fame prepares to induct seven new members |work=Pro Football Weekly website |date=July 30, 2001}}</ref> Youngblood echoed his post-retirement sentiments in his Hall of Fame acceptance speech by stating, <U+201C>I didn't sack the quarterback every time I rushed the passer.

Youngblood's style of play and perceived ability to play hurt brought many notations in NFL lore. In 1996 [[NFL Films]] named him to their list of the 100 Toughest Players of All-Time and in 2006 NFL writer Neil Reynolds featured Youngblood in his 2006 book "Pain Gang,"<ref>{{cite book |title=Pain Gang: Pro Football's Fifty Toughest Players |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/1597970131 |pages=184<U+2013>189 |last=Reynolds |first=Neil |isbn=978-1597970136 |date=October 4, 2006 |publisher=Potomac Books Inc.}}</ref> in which Reynolds names Youngblood as one of the 50 Toughest players of All-Time. In addition, ''Blitz'' magazine, ''The Sporting News'', ''Football Digest'', and ''Sport'' magazine have singled Youngblood out as one of the toughest and one of the hardest hitting players of all-time. He was named by ''[[Yahoo]]!'' writer Charles Robinson as the best-ever player taken in the 20th slot of the 1st round of the NFL draft calling Youngblood <U+201C>the essence of today's defensive end<U+2014><U+2014>a mixture of strength, toughness and speed that few ends boasted in the 1970s.<U+201D><ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=cr-bestfirstroundpicks042307&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title= Best all-time first-round picks|last=Robinson |first=Charles |work=Yahoo.com |accessdate=2007-04-28 |date=April 23, 2007}}</ref> In 2000, ''Sports Illustrated'' ranked Youngblood as #4 in its list of the greatest pass rushers of all-time, behind only [[Deacon Jones]], [[Reggie White]] and [[Lawrence Taylor]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/magazine/passrushers.flashback/ |title=Dr. Z's Alltime Greatest Pass Rushers |work=Sports Illustrated.com |accessdate=2005-11-20 |date=August 28, 2000 |last=Zimmerman |first=Paul}}</ref>

During his career, Jack won the respect of both teammates and opponents. [[Dan Dierdorf]], a Hall of Fame tackle, said that Youngblood was <U+201C>by far the toughest opponent I faced in my career<U+201D>,<ref>{{cite news |url= http://archive.profootballweekly.com/content/archives/features_2000/turney3_012201.asp |title= So close but ... |last=Turney |first=John |work=Pro Football Weekly |accessdate=2006-02-11 |date=January 22, 2001}}</ref> a thought echoed by Viking Hall of Fame tackle [[Ron Yary]] who said, <U+201C>There wasn't anybody who was tougher to block than Jack<U+201D>.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/2001/0127/1044351.html|title= Wait over for Hall-bound Youngblood|last=Drehs |first=Wayne |work=ESPN.com |accessdate=2006-09-15 |date=January 27, 2001}}</ref> Other NFL greats such as Hall of Fame tackles [[Bob Brown (offensive lineman)|Bob Brown]]<ref>{{cite book |title=Pain Gang: Pro Football's Fifty Toughest Players |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/1597970131 |page=186 |last=Reynolds |first=Neil |isbn=978-1597970136 |date=October 4, 2006 |publisher=Potomac Books Inc.}}</ref> and [[Rayfield Wright]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/distantreplayyoungblood.html |title=Distant Replay|last= |first= |work=NFL.com |date=2000-11-23 |accessdate=2008-11-29}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> rank Jack among the top players they faced.<ref name="autogenerated2"/> Opposing quarterbacks also ranked Youngblood highly, with two of them, [[Fran Tarkenton]] and [[Roger Staubach]], stating that Jack was the top defensive lineman they faced in their careers.<ref name="autogenerated2"/>  Hall of Fame defensive tackle [[Merlin Olsen]] paid Youngblood the highest compliment by stating that Jack was the <U+201C>perfect defensive end<U+2033>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ramsusa.com/youngblood.html |title=LA Rams DE Jack Youngblood  |work=Rams USA.com |date=November 19, 2003 |accessdate=2008-11-29}}</ref> Running backs also entered the chorus, <U+201C>I remember bouncing off Jack Youngblood and it was just like a pillar of strength over there on the defense,<U+201D> [[Rocky Bleier]] recalled. <U+201C>Jack played hurt, he played tough, and he was a great opponent.<U+201D><ref>{{cite book |title=Pain Gang: Pro Football's Fifty Toughest Players |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/1597970131 |page=188 |last=Reynolds |first=Neil |isbn=978-1597970136 |date=October 4, 2006 |publisher=Potomac Books Inc.}}</ref>
