The '''paper money of [[Zimbabwe]]''' were physical forms of Zimbabwe's four incarnations of the [[Zimbabwean Dollar|dollar]] ($ or Z$) from 1980 to 2009. The banknotes of the '''first dollar''' replaced those of the [[Rhodesian dollar]] at par in 1980 following the proclamation of independence.<ref name="intro"/> The [[Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe]] issued most of the banknotes and other types of currency notes in its history, including the '''Bearer cheques''' and '''Agro cheques''' ("Agro" being short for Agricultural) that circulated between 15 September 2003 and 31 December 2008: the [[Standard Chartered Bank]] also issued their own emergency cheques from 2003 to 2004.

The [[Balancing Rocks|Chiremba Balancing Rocks]] in [[Epworth, Zimbabwe|Epworth]], [[Harare]] is the main illustration on the obverse of regular banknotes of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe: for the emergency Bearer and Agro cheques, the rocks became part of the Reserve Bank's emblem that also appeared on the obverse.

== History ==
The first banknotes of [[Zimbabwe]] were issued by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (formerly Reserve Bank of [[Rhodesia]]) for the first dollar (ZWD) in 1980 to coincide with the independence of Zimbabwe. These notes replaced the circulating banknotes of the [[Rhodesian Dollar]] at par. The first series of banknotes ranged from $2 to $20, and carried the signature of Dr. Desmond Krogh, then the last Governor of the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia from 1973.<ref name="intro">{{Harvnb|Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe|1983}}</ref><ref name="deon">{{cite book|last=Geldenhuys|first=Deon|title=Isolated States: A Comparative Analysis|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521402682|page=340}}</ref> From 1994 to 1997 the Reserve Bank issued a new series of notes ranging from $2 to $100, although the $2 banknote was withdrawn and replaced by a coin in 1997.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.rbz.co.zw/about/notes.asp|title=Zimbabwe Banknotes|date=c. 1997|publisher=Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe|accessdate=7 June 2009}}</ref> As rising inflation started to affect the [[purchasing power]] of the [[Zimbabwean Dollar]], the $500 and $1&nbsp;000 banknotes were issued from 2001 to 2005 with enhanced anti-counterfeiting measures.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cuhaj|2007|pp= 1030<U+2013>1031}}</ref>

The RBZ also issued special [[traveller's cheque]]s in 2003, with six denominations ranging from $1&nbsp;000 to $100&nbsp;000. These were short-lived due to unpopularity with the general public: identification was required both during issue and encashment of such cheques, which could only be used once by the bearer. As usual, banks levied a [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] fee on all of the cheques.<ref name="travel">{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3133351.stm|title=Zimbabwe tackles cash shortage|date=8 August 2003|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 June 2009}}</ref>

On 15 September 2003, the RBZ and [[Standard Chartered]] issued special Bearer cheques with denominations ranging from $5&nbsp;000 to $20&nbsp;000.<ref name="bc_lanch">{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3116716.stm|title=Zimbabwe launches new currency|date=17 September 2003|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 June 2009}}</ref><ref name="Cargill"/> These, and subsequent issues of the first and second dollars were [[time limit]]ed and lacked sophisticated [[Counterfeit money#Anti-counterfeiting measures|anti-counterfeiting measures]] which were heavily used in many modern banknotes such as those of the [[Swiss Franc]]. In the first half of 2006 new denominations of $50&nbsp;000 and $100&nbsp;000 were issued, with the $1 million denomination being planned for September 2006; it was subsequently never issued.

The time limits were either ignored or extended by multiple decrees, meaning that all notes of these issues remained legal tender in practice until 21 August 2006.<ref name = "lastday">{{Citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/5271154.stm |title=Rush to spend old Zimbabwe money |publisher=BBC News | date=21 August 2006 | accessdate =22 July 2008 }}</ref>

On 1 August 2006 the banknotes of the second dollar (ZWN), with less elaborate designs, replaced those of the first dollar at the ratio of 1&nbsp;000 to 1.<ref name=zerotohero>{{Citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/5231836.stm |title=Zimbabwe money loses three zeros |publisher=BBC News | date=2 August 2006 |accessdate=22 July 2008 }}</ref> The [[redenomination]] (codenamed Operation Sunrise) was heavily publicised under the banner ''Zero to Hero'', but was also rapid and disorganised which resulted in many people being unable to convert their old Bearer cheques to new issues before the [[lapse]] date,<ref name = "lastday"/> The Reserve Bank Governor Dr. [[Gideon Gono]] said that "10 trillion (first dollars) were still out there and it had become manure".<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/inflation96.14725.html|title=Missing trillions now manure, says Gono|date=11 December 2009|work=newzimbabwe.com|accessdate=21 September 2009}}</ref>

Further denominations ranging from $5&nbsp;000 to $500 million were issued in the period between August 2006 and May 2008 as cent cheques quickly became outmoded. In the second quarter of 2008, special Agro cheques (Agricultural Cheques) were issued in denominations ranging from $5 billion to $100 billion as the currency exchange rate was floated.<ref name = "100mil"/> Since the functions were similar to Bearer cheques, it was in regular use as prices continue to rise. These cheques also carried [[time limit]]s and limited security features.

On 2 February 2009, banknotes of the fourth dollar (ZWL) were introduced to replace those of the third dollar at the ratio of one trillion (10<sup>12</sup>) to 1. It was originally envisaged that banknotes of the third dollar would remain legal tender until 30 June 2009 but all banknotes were withdrawn from circulation following the suspension of the Zimbabwe dollar on 12 April 2009.<ref name = "ousted"/>{{Ref label|B|II|none}}

The [[Balancing Rocks|Chiremba Balancing Rocks]] near [[Harare]] is the main artwork used for obverse sides of the first two banknote designs of the first Zimbabwean dollar. Notes of these design also feature on either side major landmarks and landscapes such as the [[Kariba Dam]] and fauna. As [[hyperinflation]] took hold at the end of the 20th century the quality of the notes deteriorated as [[printing plate]]s from previous issues were reconstituted for printing emergency notes. Although the notes of the first design were gradually phased out from 1997, all remaining notes of the first dollar were forcibly demonetised on 22 August 2006.<ref name = "lastday"/>

===Desmond Krogh series===
The '''Desmond Krogh series''' was the first series of banknotes for Zimbabwe, which carried the signature of Dr. Desmond C. Krogh, then the last governor of the [[Rhodesian Dollar|Reserve Bank of Rhodesia]]. They are dated 1980 but issued in 1981 (except for the $20 note, which was issued in 1982). The notes bear Salisbury as the name of its capital rather than [[Harare]], as the name was changed on 18 April 1982. There are four denominations in this series: $2, $5, $10 and $20; its designs make extensive use of the [[Guilloch<U+00E9>]] technique, heavily relied upon by banknotes of many currencies during the 1980s.

The 1982-dated issues banknotes differed little from the earlier, except that it took into account of the renaming of the country's capital from Salisbury to Harare. However, there was an error with early runs of the $10 banknote ([[Albert Pick|Pick]] no. 3b), because it bears Salisbury as the name of the capital city instead of Harare. These type of issues are rare. Later runs of the $10 note (Pick no. 3c) corrected the error. There were no $2 banknotes dated 1982: the second run of this denomination was taken in 1983 with K. Moyana as governor of the Reserve Bank.<ref name ="catpage_1029">{{Harvnb|Cuhaj|2007|pp= 1029<U+2013>1030}}</ref>

===Leonard Tsumba series===
In August 1993, Leonard L. Tsumba replaced K. Moyana as governor of the Reserve Bank. The banknotes which carried his signature are referred to as the '''Leonard Tsumba series'''.

The first banknotes to be issued with his signature was the two last runs of the original designs, dated 1994. The first run, which consisted of [[denomination (currency)|denominations]] from $2 to $20, had the original [[watermark]] of the Zimbabwe Bird (profile angle, short neck), whilst the second run consisted only of the $2 and $5 denominations, bearing the watermark of the bird with a longer neck and at <U+00BE> profile angle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cuhaj|2007|p= 1029}}: Zimbabwean Bird Watermark Varieties</ref>

In 1994 the general design of the banknotes was reviewed to keep up with advancing technologies against [[counterfeit]]ing, which resulted in the release of two new denominations ($50 and $100) between 1994 and 1995, also to counter the effects of consumer price inflation, which peaked at 41.6% in 1992.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/zimbabwe/inflation_rate_(consumer_prices).html|title=Zimbabwe Inflation rate (consumer prices)|date=18 December 2008|publisher=Index Mundi|accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref> Although the [[Balancing Rocks|Chiremba Balancing Rocks]] were retained, other features including latent imaging in which the letters RBZ can be seen when the banknote is tilted horizontally at the eye level and identification marks for the visually impaired were added to the design, and the neck of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark was longer. The $5, $10 and $20 banknotes were also revised with the new designs in 1997, whilst the $2 banknote was and replaced by a coin in the same year with the $5 denomination undergoing the same process in August 2001.

The $500 denomination was first issued with red as the main colour in 2001. The 2003-dated versions were brown. It was followed by the $1&nbsp;000 denomination on 2 October 2003, the sole difference between the two variants of the $1&nbsp;000 notes ([[Albert Pick|Pick]] no. 12) only being the typeface of the serial number.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3157914.stm|title=Zimbabwe launches Z$1,000 bill|date=2 October 2003|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref>

===Gideon Gono series===
The '''Gideon Gono series''' of 2004 carried the signature of the incumbent Reserve Bank governor, Dr. [[Gideon Gono]] and consisted of only one denomination of the first dollar ($500). This was the last series of regular banknotes of the first dollar, as [[hyperinflation]] forced all regular banknotes series out of use, although remaining legal tender theoretically until 21 August 2006.

==Paper money of the second dollar (ZWN)==
The [[Zimbabwean dollar]] was first [[redenomination|redenominated]] on 1 August 2006 under a [[currency reform]] campaign codenamed ''Operation Sunrise'' and involving the [[motto]] ''Zero to Hero''.<ref name = "zerotohero"/> New-style bearer cheques of the second dollar ([[ISO 4217]]:ZWN) was introduced and replaced those of the first dollar (ZWD) at the ratio of 1&nbsp;000 to 1.

The change over process was given at short notice and was also rapid because all issues prior to the August 2006 series were to be demonetised and rendered worthless on 21 August 2006. Poor communications meant that many civilians of Zimbabwe were unable to convert old bearer cheques to new ones before the deadline.<ref name = "lastday"/>

===2006, 2007 and 2008 Bearer cheque series===

The '''2006 bearer cheque series''' was put into circulation on 1 August 2006 and initially consisted of 14 denominations, ranging from 1<U+00A2> to $100&nbsp;000. The cheques were signed by [[Gideon Gono|Dr. Gideon Gono]] and were set to expire on 31 July 2007, except for the $100 and $500 cheques, which were initially due to expire on 31 December 2007, but later extended to 31 July 2008.<ref name=100_500>{{Citation|title=Zimbabwean Government Gazette | volume=Vol. 85 | page= 1183 | date=19 December 2007|accessdate=7 June 2009 | url=http://www.rbz.co.zw/pdfs/statutory.pdf}}</ref> The $5 denomination was also issued, despite not being widely publicised in the changeover campaign.<ref>{{Wayback |df=yes|url=http://www.zimdollar.co.zw/pdfs/currency.pdf |title=New Bearer Cheques Family (2006) |date=20070626193831 }}</ref>

Two variations that were issued for the $10&nbsp;000 and $100&nbsp;000 denominations are recognised in the [[Standard Catalog of World Paper Money]]: the difference between them was the use of [[digit grouping]]. Cheques with the denomination expressed as '10000' or '100000' bear serial numbers with the (scarce) prefix '''AA''', while notes with prefixes '''AB''' onwards is expressed as '10&nbsp;000' or '100&nbsp;000'.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cuhaj|2009|pp=1108}}</ref>

The '''2007 bearer cheque series''' was first issued on 2 March 2007 with the introduction of $5&nbsp;000 and $50&nbsp;000 cheques to act as intermediary denominations between the $1&nbsp;000, $10&nbsp;000 and $100&nbsp;000 cheques respectively.<ref name=lighten>{{Citation |first=Blessing |last=Zulu |title=Zimbabwe Central Bank Lightens Purses By Issuing Z$50,000 Note |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/Africa/Zimbabwe/2007-03-01-voa47.cfm |publisher= Voice of America |date= 1 March 2007 |accessdate=7 August 2008 }}</ref> As inflation intensified, the $200&nbsp;000 bearer cheque was also introduced on 1 August 2007, followed by the joint introduction of the $250&nbsp;000, $500&nbsp;000, and $750&nbsp;000 denominations on 20 December 2007.<ref>{{cite press release | title =Introducing the new $250&nbsp;000, $500&nbsp;000 (back-dated to 1 July 2007) and $750&nbsp;000 bearer cheques | publisher =Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe | date =18 December 2008 | url =http://www.rbz.co.zw/pdfs/bearer.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate =11 October 2008 }}</ref> The $200&nbsp;000 bearer cheque had its date of lapse extended twice up to 31 December 2008.

The $50&nbsp;000 denomination was the first denomination to use the [[Optically Variable Ink]] technique, on the value positioned at the top right of the obverse. The $750&nbsp;000 denomination of the December 2007 series was the only note out of all cheques of the second dollar to bear a [[hologram|holographic]] strip, as the cheque was printed on paper that was prepared for the 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;ZWD notes ([[Albert Pick|Pick]] No. 12).<ref name="cat2009">{{Harvnb|Cuhaj|2009|pp=1109}}</ref>

The circulation of the '''2008 bearer cheque series''' commenced on 18 January 2008 with three [[denomination (currency)|denominations]] ranging from $1 million to $10 million,<ref>{{cite press release | title =Introducing the new $1,000,000, $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 Bearer Cheques | publisher =Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe | date =18 January 2008 | url =http://www.rbz.co.zw/pdfs/highDenom2.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate =11 October 2008 }}</ref> and concluded with the issue of the $500 million bearer cheque on 15 May 2008. Three denominations of the 2008 series remained [[legal tender]] at the ratio of 10<sup>10</sup> to 1 until being demonetised on 31 December 2008.<ref name="sun2"/>

There are two variants of the $10 million denomination, the primary difference being the [[typeface]] and size of the serial number. Those with slightly larger serial numbers bear the prefix '''DA'''. The $25 million banknote is larger in dimension out of the rest of the 2008 series.<ref name="cat2009"/>

===Agro cheque series===

The Reserve Bank issued '''Special Agro (Agricultural) cheques''' from 15 May to 31 July 2008. Although of a different design and with the intention for use only by farmers, it had found its way into regular use because of the parallel functions with bearer Cheques and the exponential rise of food prices. Following the 2008 currency reform, Agro and bearer cheques were phased out on 1 January 2009.<ref name="sun2"/>

The four denominations in this series are not the same by dimensions as the $25 billion note used different paper from the 500 ZWD banknote of 2001. The $100 billion ($10<sup>11</sup>) Agro Cheque was the largest of the second dollar, sharing the record for the most number of zeroes depicted on a banknote with the [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] 500 billion ($5<U+00D7>10<sup>11</sup>) dinar note of 1993, up until January 2009.

== Paper money of the third dollar (ZWR) ==

The '''2007 banknote series''' was prepared by the Reserve Bank in October 2006 for the abandoned second phase of Operation Sunrise.<ref name = "sunrise2">{{Citation |url=http://www.rbz.co.zw/pdfs/Sunrise2.pdf |title=Statement by Gideon Gono, Governor |author=Gono, Gideon |publisher=Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe |date=21 November 2007 |accessdate =21 July 2008 |format=PDF}}</ref> The [[Balancing Rocks|Chiremba Balancing Rocks]] was to be reinstated as the main feature on the obverse whilst use of the [[Zimbabwe Bird]] watermark continued. There were additional security features as opposed to previous issues, which included [[security thread]]s, see-through register marks and recognition marks for the partially sighted. [[Hologram|Holographic]] security threads and [[Optically Variable Ink]] were used on the $100, $500 and $1&nbsp;000 notes. When the redenomination of 1 August 2008 occurred these notes were put into circulation as banknotes of the third dollar between 1 August 2008 to 31 December 2008.<ref name = "thousand">{{Citation |author=Maphosa, Tendai |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-09/2008-09-18-voa59.cfm |title=Zimbabwe Unveils Z$1000 Note as Leaders Discuss Cabinet |publisher=Voice of America | date=18 September 2008 | accessdate =4 December 2008 }}</ref>

The '''2008 banknote series''' circulated from 29 September 2008 to 12 April 2009. The series demonstrated the intensity of [[hyperinflation]] during the period as the highest denomination increased from $1&nbsp;000 to $100 trillion ($10<sup>14</sup>) by January 2009, the latter being the largest denomination issued by the Reserve Bank.{{Ref label|C|III|none}} The first issues of the series were the $10&nbsp;000 and $20&nbsp;000 denominations.<ref name="4zeros">{{Citation |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/business/news/article_1433646.php |title=Zimbabweans get two bigger banknotes as economic collapse deepens |publisher=Monsters and Critics | date=29 September 2008 | accessdate =29 September 2008 }}</ref> These were followed by the following denominations:

The large number of denominations issued in late-2008 as well as the suspension of paper supply by [[Giesecke & Devrient]] affected the Reserve Bank's ability to maintain the quality of the banknotes. Later denominations copied design features from the original 2007 banknote series and lacked many modern security features that banknotes of major currencies (such as the [[Canadian Dollar]]) relied on. The notes denominated from $20&nbsp;000 to $500&nbsp;000 and then from $10 million onwards used non-watermarked paper, whilst the $500 million notes were printed on pure cotton.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200812120834.html |title=Zimbabwe: New Z$500 Million Cotton Bill Introduced|last=Guma|first=Lance |publisher=[[SW Radio Africa]] | date=12 December 2008 | accessdate =9 January 2009 }}</ref> A silhouette of the Zimbabwe Bird in [[Optically Variable Ink]] was used in such notes to compensate for this, but the iridescent strip was dropped for higher denominations. The $10&nbsp;000 and $1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000 notes reused paper for the $1&nbsp;000 notes (Pick no. 72), thereby carrying the embedded holographic thread and [[watermark]]. Two types of paper (regular and lined) were used on $20&nbsp;000, $50&nbsp;000 and $500&nbsp;000 banknotes.<ref name="500k_line"/><ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.banknotenews.com/files/3d082fbca80f3b32c491c39305d5e072-926.php|title=Zimbabwe lined paper 50,000-dollar note confirmed|last=Linzmayer|first=Owen|date=15 December 2010|accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref>

== Paper money of the fourth dollar (ZWL) ==

The Zimbabwe dollar was again reformed on 2 February 2009 when the fourth dollar replaced the third dollar at the ratio of 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;000 (10<sup>12</sup>) to 1 with the original intention of phasing out the latter by 1 July 2009.<ref name="sun3" /> The '''2009 banknote series''' was issued for the fourth dollar which circulated from 2 February 2009 until the suspension of the [[Zimbabwe dollar|dollar]] on 12 April 2009.<ref name = "ousted"/> The series consisted of denominations ranging from $1 to $500. The notes had a revised design with [[Chevron (insignia)|chevrons]] as registration devices, the Zimbabwe Bird in [[Optically Variable Ink]] and an iridescent strip. Most parts of the design were recycled from designs of past issues and do not have a [[watermark]] although a plain space existed in the areas where it would normally be positioned.

==Valuation and collecting ability==

Hyperinflationary Zimbabwean banknotes (such as the $100 trillion denomination) have gained considerable interest from the [[Numismatic]] community and buyers in general for its absurdity rather than the design. Some examples of such notes may be sold further in excess of their true face value.<ref name="ebay">{{Citation |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/2479937/Zimbabwes-worthless-100bn-notes-sell-for-huge-profit-on-eBay.html |author=Moore, Matthew |title=Zimbabwe's 'worthless' $100bn notes sell for huge profit on eBay |publisher=The Telegraph |date=31 July 2008 |accessdate =17 November 2008 }}</ref>

The price and value of a Zimbabwean banknote depend on various factors: the rarity, based on factors such as the name of capital city, how long it was printed, or the type of watermark; its condition, and the national situation at time of issue, such as shortages or hyperinflation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/05/zimbabwean-dollars-are-finally-worth-something/|title=Zimbabwean Dollars Are Finally Worth Something|last=Rampell|first=Catherine|date=5 January 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=9 January 2011}}</ref> Common designs and variants such as the $100 note of 1995 ([[Albert Pick|Pick]] no. 9) are usually valued at about $1 apiece, while rare varieties such as the $10 Salisbury error note (Pick no. 3b) and the Standard Chartered issues are valued at around $100 or more. Zimbabwean banknotes are usually sold by banknote dealers over the counter or on the internet, although the most valued types theoretically qualify for inclusion in auction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cuhaj|2009|pp=1109}}: [[Albert Pick|Pick]] No. 4b ($20), was estimated to be worth around $300 as of 2009.</ref>

==Other circulating banknotes==

As in every fiscal emergency, hard currency, particularly the United States dollar, has long served as a parallel currency on the black market, and many prices in shops would be posted in US dollars, even during periods when it was illegal to possess foreign currency or to transact business in US dollars.

A unique form of circulating specie is the Petrol Coupon, which has been issued in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. Known denominations include 1, 5, 10, 20, & 50 litres of petrol (gasoline) and/or diesel, and translate roughly into the local petrol price (about 1 UK pound sterling per litre or US$1.50 in late 2008).<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1042358/Now-petrol-coupons-new-currency-Zimbabwe.html|title=Now petrol coupons are the new currency in Zimbabwe|last=Smith|first=Elizabeth|date=7 August 2008|work=Daily Mail |location=UK|accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref> Businesses, including Western Union, have been reported paying employees with these coupons, and even auctions have been transacted in this currency.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/08/zimbabwe|title=Petrol coupons traded as cash in Zimbabwe|last=McGreal|first=Chris|date=8 August 2008|work=The Guardian |location=UK|accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref> As with much Zimbabwe currency, printing standards are crude and counterfeiting is rampant; the RBZ has been dissuading this widespread use.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200901010011.html|title=Zimbabwe: Fuel Coupons Warning|date=1 January 2009|publisher=The Herald (Harare), retrieved from allAfrica.com|accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref>

==Notes==

<div class="references-small">
'''<small>I</small>.''' {{Note label|A|I|none}} The [[Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe]] issued 21 additional denominations between 1 September 2008 and 2 February 2009. They were as follows: $1&nbsp;000, $10&nbsp;000, $20&nbsp;000, $50&nbsp;000, $100&nbsp;000, $500&nbsp;000, $1 million, $10 million, $50 million, $100 million, $200 million, $500 million, $1 billion, $5 billion, $10 billion, $20 billion, $50 billion, $10 trillion, $20 trillion, $50 trillion and $100 trillion.

Information about the 2008 banknote series which involved the issue of such notes can be found in the section [[Banknotes of Zimbabwe#Paper money of the third dollar (ZWR)|Paper money of the third dollar (ZWR)]].

'''<small>II</small>.''' {{Note label|B|II|none}} The Interbank, [[black market]] and official exchange rates were monitored for a time after the suspension of the dollar on 12 April 2009: for example, on 2 August 2009 one US dollar would buy Z$363.07.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.xe.com/ucc/convert.cgi?Amount=1.00&From=USD&To=ZWD |title=XE.com Conversion <U+2013> 1.00&nbsp;USD to ZWD |publisher=XE.com |date=18 May 2009 |accessdate =18 May 2009}}</ref>

'''<small>III</small>.''' {{Note label|C|III|none}} The $100 trillion (10<sup>14</sup>) banknote ([[Albert Pick|Pick]] No. 91) is the largest denomination ever issued by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and is accepted by most numismatists as a banknote with the most zeroes ever shown in the design. Before 16 January 2009 the 500 billion dinar (5<U+00D7>10<sup>11</sup>) banknote of Yugoslavia (Pick No. 137) held such status.

However, the [[Guinness World Records]] recognises the Hungarian 1 billion b.-peng<U+0151> (10<sup>21</sup>) [[Paper money of the Hungarian peng<U+0151>|banknote]] (Pick No. 137) as the world's largest denomination, although the 100 million b.-peng<U+0151> (10<sup>20</sup>) (Pick No. 136) was the largest denomination to be issued.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://tomchao.com/trivia.html|title=Paper Money Trivia|last=Chao|first=Tom|date=2 March 2009|accessdate=3 March 2009}}</ref>
