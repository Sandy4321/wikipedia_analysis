'''''Coleophora neolycii''''' is a [[moth]] of the [[Coleophoridae]] family. It is found in [[China]] (Ningxia).

The [[wingspan]] is 12.5-13.5 mm.

The larvae feed on ''[[Lycium barbarum]]''. They feed in the leaves or stems of their host plant. They primarily mine the leaves from the underside. The first generation begins feeding in the middle of May and causes severe damage from the middle of June to early July.  Different instars overwinter in cases attached to branches or axillary buds. Pupation takes place from the middle of April to early May within the larval case that is attached to a stem with silk after the final instar turns around to face the anal opening of the case. The pupa is about 5.5 mm in length and yellowish brown. Adults emerge in May.

==Etymology==
The specific name is derived from the Greek prefix ''neo''- (meaning new) and the specific name ''lycii'', in reference to its relationship with ''[[Coleophora lycii]]''.
