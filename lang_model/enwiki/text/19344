== Harrell's vocal production philosophy ==

Harrell is a rarity in that he is a vocal producer who engineers all his own sessions.  He is quoted as saying "...I engineer all of my own stuff.  I create the pace that the artist wants.  To have someone in the middle -- another engineer -- would slow down my process."<ref name="Rob Putnum 2009. pg 20">Rob Putnum, Music Connection, Volume 33, May 28, 2009.  pg 20</ref>

Regarding vocal processors, Harrell says "it's the sound of today in pop music.  But I use it as an enhancement and not to create the sound.  My role is to capture the artist's personality.  To trick them out with Auto-Tune would defeat that purpose. but consumers are used to hearing things pitch perfect so I use pitch correction to ensure that I have a flawless performance."<ref name="Rob Putnum 2009. pg 20"/>

Kuk sites the three most important things he has learned in his career as<br /> 
1. "Always be professional."<br />
2. "Be patient at all times."<br />
3. "It's not about you.  A producer has the opportunity to put his image onto a project before getting the best sound from the artist.  Remember that the artist is what it's all about."<ref name="Rob Putnum 2009. pg 20"/>
