"'''Sugar, Sugar'''" is a [[pop song]] written by keyboardist Ronald Frangipane and co-written by Andy Kim. It was a four-week 1969 number-one hit single by fictional characters [[The Archies]]. Produced by [[Jeff Barry]], the song was originally released on the album ''Everything's Archie.'' The album is the product of a group of [[studio musician]]s managed by [[Don Kirshner]]. [[Ron Dante]]'s lead vocals were accompanied by those of [[Toni Wine]] (who sang the line "I'm gonna make your life so sweet"), [[Andy Kim]], and [[Ellie Greenwich]]. Together they provided the voices of the various Archies using [[multitrack recording|multitracking]]. [[Ray Stevens]], the comic singer, provided the hand claps to the song{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}.

When the song was initially released, Kirshner had promotion men play it for radio station execs without telling them the name of the group (due to the somewhat-disappointing chart success of the Archies' previous single, "Bang-Shang-a-Lang," which went to #22 on the [[Billboard]] [[Hot 100]] charts). Only after most of the DJs liked the song were they told that it was performed by a cartoon group. The Archies<U+2019> hit wound up as one of the biggest (and most unexpected) #1 hits of the year, arguably one of the biggest [[bubblegum]] hits of all time, both in America and in Great Britain, thanks partly to massive promotion on the hit [[CBS-TV]] Saturday morning cartoon series.

The Archies' "Sugar, Sugar" was the 1969 [[Billboard Year-End|number-one single of the year]]. A week after topping the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM 100]]'' national singles chart in Canada on September 13, 1969 (where it spent three weeks), it went on to spend four weeks at the top of the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100]] from September 20 and eight weeks at the top of the UK singles chart. The song lists at #63 on ''Billboard's Greatest Songs of All Time.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/specials/hot100/charts/top100-titles-70.shtml|title=The Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs (70-61)|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|language=en|accessdate=2008-11-01}}</ref> It also peaked at one in the South African Singles Chart.<ref>[http://www.rock.co.za/files/springbok_top_20_(A).html South African Singles Chart]</ref> On February 5, 2006, "Sugar, Sugar" was inducted into the [[Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame]], as co-writer Andy Kim is originally from [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].

The song is said to have been earlier offered to [[The Monkees]], although additional rumors that it was recorded using session musicians with [[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]] providing all the vocals, but never released, are false. Don Kirshner has said that [[Mike Nesmith]] put his fist through the wall of the Beverley Hills hotel refusing to do "Sugar, Sugar."<ref>Kirshner interview on "Popular Song: Soundtrack of the Century episode Modern Pop"; Ron Dante also clarifies this on a DVD called "Archie's Funhouse," a three-disc set that features Ron Dante in a bonus segment.</ref> Jones confirmed that Kirshner had offered it to them, but stated they turned it down, and he never recorded it.<ref>David "Davy" Jones in conversation 12/27/2008 Las Vegas, NV</ref> The band thought it seemed cheesy and at that point they were looking to mature their sound.  However, Monkees archival expert Andrew Sandoval has suggested that the band may instead actually have been offered a tune called "Sugar Man", but with the passage of time the parties involved simply mis-remembered it as being "Sugar, Sugar", in large part because it made a better anecdote.

Although official [[music recording sales certification]]s were not introduced in the United Kingdom until the [[British Phonographic Industry]] was formed in 1973, ''[[Disc (magazine)|Disc]]'' introduced an initiative in 1959 to present a gold record to singles that sold over one million units.<ref name="Disc">{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Alan|title=UK First Charts & Silver Discs|url=http://www.davemcaleer.com/page17.htm|work=[[Dave McAleer]]'s website|accessdate=4 November 2010}}</ref> The awards relied on record companies correctly compiling and supplying sales information, and "Sugar, Sugar" was erroneously awarded a gold disc in January 1970 having sold approximately 945,000 copies; the [[RCA]] informed ''Disc'' that one million copies had been shipped, however not all were sold.<ref name="Disc"/><ref name="Million">{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/stats-million_sellers.php|title=Stats and Facts: Million Sellers|publisher=[[The Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=19 July 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080416145908/www.theofficialcharts.com/stats-million_sellers.php|archivedate=16 April 2008}}</ref> Nevertheless, following the introduction of [[music download]]s in 2004, "Sugar, Sugar" passed the one-million sales mark.<ref name="MW">{{cite journal|date=6 September 2010|title=Digital generation pushes the oldies into the million-sellers club|journal=[[Music Week]]}}</ref>

===Trivia===
{{Trivia|date=June 2010}}
On September 4, 2006, Dante and Wine performed the song together on the [[Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon]]. This was the first time they had publicly performed the song together. They performed it again at one of Toni Wine's performances at the Genghis Cohen in [[West Hollywood]].

Former President [[George W. Bush]] has said "Sugar, Sugar" is one of his favorite songs. The song played in [[Jenna Bush]]'s wedding party in May, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/world-news/daughters-wedding-was-awfully-special-george-bush_10047800.html|title=Bush's daughter's wedding|author=Thaindian News|accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref>

In the TV Movie ''Archie: To Riverdale and Back again'' (VHS reissued title, ''Return to Riverdale''), the now-older Jughead plays the original version of the song to his son; later he uses it to bridge the 'age gap' between them when he finds out his son is shy around girls &mdash; the two perform a 'rap' version of the song.

The song was featured in the episode ''That's All There Is'' in the 1998 HBO Mini-Series [[From the Earth to the Moon (TV miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]. Astronauts Al Bean and Dick Gordon are seen singing the song in their Command Module during their 4 day trip to the moon on [[Apollo 12]] in November 1969.

Millions upon millions of copies of this record were distributed through an unusual distribution mode. A thin plastic record of the song was laminated directly onto the backs of Kelloggs breakfast cardboard cereal boxes (Sugar Pops & Sugar Smacks) and the laminated cardbord record could be cut out and played on a turntable.

===In pop culture===
The song is featured in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episodes "[[Boy-Scoutz N the Hood]]" and "[[Sweets and Sour Marge]]". In the former, Homer has a hallucination about dancing ice cream cones while trapped on a raft; he was listening to the song on [[Rod Flanders|Rod Flanders']] [[personal stereo]], but as the batteries run down, the song gradually slows down and stops and the ice creams melt, ending his dream.

In the [[The Archie Show|1970's Filmation cartoon]], [[Sabrina Spellman|Sabrina the Teenage Witch]] is seen dancing to the song on the [[record player]] in the first few minutes of "Weatherbee's Disasterpiece".

English hard rock band [[Def Leppard]] got the idea for their 1987 hit "[[Pour Some Sugar on Me]]" from the song.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The original recording can be heard in the ''[[Dreamworks]]'' Film ''[[Bee Movie]]'' while Barry, played by ''[[Jerry Seinfeld]]'', is dreaming.

The song was adapted for a [[TV commercial]] for [[Equal (sweetener)|Equal]] brand [[artificial sweetener]] in the late '80s -- ''"Sugar (no no no no no no)/Now there's Equal (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)".''

The song is adapted for a TV commercial for a sweetener product called "Gulaku" in [[Indonesia]]. They use many different versions of the song, depending on the storyline that is being depicted in the commercial. It is one of the most expensive advertisements in Indonesia, and the TV commercial reintroduced the song to Indonesian listeners.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl.php?mod=browse&op=read&id=jbptitbpp-gdl-indrapradh-33488 |title=STUDY ANALYSIS OF GULAKU ADVERTISEMENT ON COSTUMER PERCEPTION IN BANDUNG}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp3WNgJ9kqY |title=Gulaku - Amazing 60" 2008 (RT Films)}}</ref>

A version of the song sung by The Nerds is used as a theme for the [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]] series ''[[Cake Boss]]''. Early promos for its spinoff, ''[[Next Great Baker]]'', also use ''Sugar, Sugar'', though using the original Archies version.

The song was played in the 1996 movie ''[[A Very Brady Sequel]]'' when [[Greg Brady|Greg]] saw a beautiful girl coming out of the swimming pool and later saw that it was [[Marcia Brady|Marcia]].

The song was sung by Richie in an episode of ''[[Family Matters]]'' when he and 3J were trying to win affection of a girl to be their Valentine.  3J thought the song too childish and it hurt Richie's feelings, but the girl decided to pick him over 3J.

The gingerbread man in ''[[Dreamworks]]'' Film '' [[Shrek 2]]'' sings the song in the [[DVD]]'s special feature "Far Far Away Idol".
