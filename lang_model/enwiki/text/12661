{{Nihongo|'''Isshin-Ryu'''|<U+4E00><U+5FC3><U+6D41>|Isshin-ry<U+016B>}} is a style of [[Okinawa]]n [[karate]] founded by [[Tatsuo Shimabuku]] (<U+5CF6><U+888B> <U+9F8D><U+592B>) and named by him on 15 January 1956. Isshin-Ry<U+016B> karate is largely a synthesis of [[Shorin-ry<U+016B>]] karate, [[Goj<U+016B>-ry<U+016B>]] karate, and [[Okinawan kobud<U+014D>|kobud<U+014D>]]. The name means, literally, "one heart way". As of 1989 there are 336 branches of Isshin-ry<U+016B> throughout the world, most of which are concentrated in the United States.<ref name="Bishop">{{cite book |last = Bishop |first = Mark |title = Okinawan Karate |year = 1989 |isbn =0-7136-5666-2 |pages = 93<U+2013>94 }}</ref>

== Kata ==
The system is summed up in its [[Kata (martial arts)|kata]], or formal practice methods, and the specific techniques used to punch (vertical fist) and kick (snapping kicks). In many of the various forms of the system, sixteen kata (eight empty-hand, three [[Bo (weapon)|bo]], two [[Sai (weapon)|sai]], a bo-bo kumite kata, a bo-sai kumite kata and one [[tonfa|tuifa]] kata) are agreed upon as composing Isshin-ryu. These kata include original developments of the Master, and inherited kata from the parent styles.<ref>[http://msisshinryu.com/articles/swift/kata.shtml The Kata of Okinawa Isshinryu Karate-do: An Informal Discussion on their Possible Origins, Joe Swift, Tokyo, Japan]</ref>

=== Empty-Hand Kata ===

==== Seisan ====
Tatsuo Shimabuku learned [[Seisan]] from his primary instructor, [[Chotoku Kyan]].<ref>[http://msisshinryu.com/kata/empty/seisan.shtml Seisan]</ref> Previous to Kyan's instruction, the Seisan form was a staple of local traditions.

This kata is sometimes the first introduced to students after the First and Second Charts of basics have been learned. This is in contrast to other Shorin systems where this kata is learned after other fundamental kata.

The [[Goj<U+016B>-ry<U+016B>]] curriculum includes a related version of Seisan, but Isshin-ry<U+016B> Seisan was learned from Kyan, not Miyagi.

==== Seiunchin ====
This kata was brought into Isshinryu from Shimabuku's studies with the Goj<U+016B>-ry<U+016B> Ryu founder, [[Chojun Miyagi]]. It is theorized by researchers that this kata is an original composed by Miyagi, based on his experiences in Fuzhou, China.<ref>[http://msisshinryu.com/kata/empty/seiunchin.shtml Seiunchin]</ref>

The kata focuses on the stance "shiko-dachi", (sometimes referred to as "seiunchin-dachi") a low horse stance at which the knees are bent at obtuse angles and the feet are angled away from the direction the body is facing at forty-five degree angles. The kata is broken into segments, each utilizing a specific breathing and muscle-tensing method. The kata has no obvious kicks, but one section contains hints of a rising knee strike.

==== Naihanchi ====
[[Naihanchi]] comes to Isshin Ryu from studies with both [[Chotoku Kyan]] and [[Motobu Choki]] (a cousin of Kyan). It is also considered one of the staples of Ryukyu Ti, and is prevalent in most forms of Karate. The Isshin Ryu version is influenced heavily by the [[kumite]] of Motobu, with the exception of the turned-in toes (Motobu preferred the horse-riding stance with the toes in a neutral position). Naihanche kata is the first of the "go-kyu" (blue belt) kata, and together with Wansu form the requirements for the first of the teaching ranks "yon-kyu" (green belt.)

The kata is also noted for its use of the "Nami Gaeshi", the returning wave kick. The kick has many different potentials for application, including the sweeping or redirecting of a low kick, a kick or knee to the inside of an opponent's thigh, knee, tibia and ankle. It also has the movement training potential for the basics of the sequential summation of movement. Some interpret the move as a low "yoko-gari" (side kick) from naihanche-dachi to the opponents farthest ankle, inside-calf, or knee, and returning the kick to the body around the opponent's nearest leg across one's body to the hip and back down to naihanche-stance.

A popular interpretation of the kata concerns its position; the entire sequence of moves in the kata is to be executed as if one is standing up against a wall and one's opponents are to his left and right. It is because of this that the kata is usually taught with the back straight and the heels  and back placed firmly either on a straight edge such as a board or a wall, or on top of a long piece of tape.

The main stance of naihanchi is a slight variant from the Isshin Ryu stance "kiba-dachi," in which both feet are shoulder width apart facing forward. "Naihanche-dachi," as it's called, takes kiba-dachi and turns the balls of the feet (area of foot just behind the toes) and turns them forty-five degrees inward and accentuates the continuous bend at the knees Insshin Ryu Karateka are taught from initiation.

==== Wans<U+016B> ====
Also coming from Kyan, [[Wansh<U+016B>]] (also known as Wansu) has several iterations on the island of [[Ryukyu]]. Popular history has the kata coming from a Chinese political visitor who, during his duties, taught his fighting method in the open.

Isshin Ryu's version of this form is unique for its inclusion of two side kicks - techniques seen in the system previously only in the Chart Two exercises. Current research hints at this change being made by [[Shimabuku Tatsuo]] himself.<ref>[http://msisshinryu.com/kata/empty/wansu.shtml Wansu]</ref>

For technical content, the form tends to focus on the slipping and in-close evasion and redirection of attack. It also contains a unique movement often described as a [[fireman's carry]] throw, or dump. Because of this, many schools nickname this kata "the dumping form". Also, Wansu is one of two kata in Isshin Ryu which use the "zenkutsu dachi", a long, angled seisan-type stance.

==== Chinto ====
As with most of the kata in Isshin Ryu, [[Chinto]] comes from the teaching of Kyan.<ref>[http://msisshinryu.com/kata/empty/chinto.shtml Chinto]</ref> 

The kata differs from others in that its embusen is a line placed on a 45 degree angle. The footwork is indicative of a slipping, deflecting, and a whipping, relaxed body motion. Some karate instructors consider the previously learned forms of the system, Naihanchi and Wansu, to be preparatory and basic training forms, culminating in the kata Chinto.

====Kusanku====
Of the eight weaponless kata in Isshin-Ryu, five come from the teaching of [[Chotoku Kyan]]. [[K<U+016B>sank<U+016B> (kata)|Kusanku]] is one of these. 

Kusanku is often referred to as a "night-fighting" kata, or a form which teaches fighting at night. Modern research does not support this theory.<ref>[http://msisshinryu.com/kata/empty/kusanku.shtml Kusanku]</ref> In reality, the kata is set up in such a manner as to allow continual study of application potential from basic standing grappling and close striking in the beginning, to more aggressive and proactive techniques near the end.

Kusanku is the second of two kata which contain the [[Front stance|zenkutsu-dachi]] in Isshin-Ryu.

==== Sunsu ====
This kata was designed by the founder of Isshin-Ryu, Shimabuku Tatsuo.<ref>[http://msisshinryu.com/kata/empty/sunsu.shtml Sunsu]</ref> It incorporates several movements from other kata in the Isshin-Ryu syllabus, as well as from kata from other instructors, in addition to techniques and concepts Shimabuku favored. It was used as a dojo kata and as a personal project of the founder, prior to the founding of Isshin Ryu in 1956. Sunsu is the only kata that is only in Isshin Ryu. It takes sequences from the other katas in Issin Ryu making it easy to get caught up in another kata while performing Sunsu.

The [[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]] has recognized Sunsu as a kata of Okinawa. This represents an acceptance of Isshin-Ryu as a modern Ryukyu martial art.

==== Sanchin ====
Coming from [[Miyagi Chojun]], [[Sanchin]] has its origins in the Goj<U+016B>-ry<U+016B> Ryu system. Along with [[Seiunchin]], this is one of two Goj<U+016B>-ry<U+016B> katas in Isshin-ry<U+016B>.  Previous to the instruction of Miyagi, the kata was practiced with open hands, turns, and natural breathing methods. With the founding of Goj<U+016B>-ry<U+016B>, this form was practiced with closed fists (a more traditional method on Okinawa), no turns, and a controlled, almost hard inhalation and exhalation.

Touted primarily for its physical training aspects, Sanchin also contains many applicable martial techniques. 

Shimabuku also thought very highly of the form, saying once, "Sanchin is for health. Without health, how can one have karate?"

=== B<U+014D> Kata ===

==== Tokumeni no Kun (sometimes referred to as Tokumine no Kun)====
This [[b<U+014D>]] form comes to the Isshin Ryu system from Shimabuku's time with [[Ch<U+014D>toku Kyan]].<ref>[http://msisshinryu.com/kata/kobudo/tokumine.shtml Tokumine]</ref> Kyan is to have learned the form either from Tokumeni himself, or from Tokumeni's landlord after the aforementioned had passed on. Shimabuku Tatsuo also commented that this was his favorite kata.  Different isshin -ryu schools spell the name differently by changing the "e" and the "i".  Research thus far has shown that the kata was named after someone.  However, at this time, no genealogical findings have been found for the spelling "Tokumine" while several are noted for "Tokumeni".

==== Urashi no Kun ====
The form Urashi no Kun was taught to Shimabuku by his kobud<U+014D> instructor, [[Shinken Taira]].<ref>[http://msisshinryu.com/kata/kobudo/urashi.shtml Urashi]</ref> Taira is the founder of the Ry<U+016B>ky<U+016B> Kobud<U+014D> Hozon Shinkokai,<ref>[http://www.ryukyu-kobudo.com/  Ryukyu Kobud<U+014D> Hozon Shinko Kai]</ref> whose goal is the preservation of Okinawa's weapons forms.

==== Shishi no Kun ====
Shimabuku learned this form from Shinken Taira who learned it from Jinsei Kamiya.

The kata itself uses the bo in a horizontal manner, different from other cudgel  traditions.<ref>[http://msisshinryu.com/kata/kobudo/shishi.shtml Shishi]</ref>

=== Sai Kata ===

==== Kusanku Sai ====
This form is a product of Shimabuku's own research into the art of [[Okinawan kobud<U+014D>|kobud<U+014D>]], the coverall for Okinawa's weapons studies. 

The kata was built as an introduction to [[Sai (weapon)|Sai]] practice, with the weapon movements replacing the empty-hand applications.

The form is taught one of two ways: with or without kicks.<ref>[http://msisshinryu.com/kata/kobudo/kusankusai.shtml kusanku]</ref>

==== Chatan Yara no Sai ====
Chatan Yara is taught as the second Sai kata in the Isshin Ryu system, coming from Shimabuku's instruction with Shinken Taira.

The form focuses on the development of the "sequential summation of movement", which is the scientific term for full-body whipping motion. This is exemplified by the emphasis on whipping strikes, which make up a vast majority of the offensive movements in the form.

==== Kyan no Sai ====
This form comes either from Shimabuku's studies of Sai methodology with Kyan, his primary karate instructor, or was possibly a form taught in its entirety. Shimabuku was teaching this kata  in 1951 but by 1958 he had dropped in favor of Kusanku.<ref>[http://www.msisshinryu.com/articles/aja/kusankusai.shtml Kyan]</ref>

=== Tonfa Kata ===

==== Hama Higa no Tuifa ====
This form is from Shimabuku's studies with [[Shinken Taira]]. It is the only [[Tonfa]] kata in the Isshinryu system. Shimabuku always referred to the weapon as [[tuifa]].<ref>[http://msisshinryu.com/kata/kobudo/hamahiga.shtml Hamahiga]</ref>

The kata bears many similarities to the [[Uechi-ry<U+016B>|Uechi Ry<U+016B>]] empty-hand form "Seisan", and actually contains an entire section from the form, albeit performed with weapons in-hand. It also has several postures seen in other kobud<U+014D> kata, the most notable posture being "Crane on a Rock". Whether this is from the encyclopedic kobud<U+014D> of Taira, or was a part of Hama Higa to begin with is not historically verifiable.

Some Isshin-Ryu schools teach the kata in a different order. However, Shimabuku Tatsuo taught the kata in the above order.

== Other Curriculum ==

=== Upper Body Basics ===

Developed by Tatsuo Shimabuku and one of his Okinawan students Kaneshi Eiko, the first chart (though some first-generation students learned this chart after the lower-body chart) of basic techniques is unique to the Isshin Ryu system.

Though the technical content and number of techniques varies by lineage, the first Chart One was simply a collection of 15 upper-body dominant techniques Shimabuku felt were necessary for proper development.

=== Lower Body Basics ===

Developed at the same time as the first chart, the second set of techniques are the basic kicking techniques of the Isshin Ryu system. As with the first chart, the number of techniques, as well as actual technical content, vary by lineage. The initial chart contained eight kicking techniques.

=== Kotekitai ===

Kotekitai is the Okinawan term for arm conditioning. Karada-kitai is the term for body conditioning with ashi-kitai for the feet, fukubu-kitai for the stomach, etc. It is not unique to Isshin Ryu, and is also used by similar styles such as Shohei-Ryu, another branch of Uechi-Ryu.

=== Makiwara ===

As with the Kotekitai, the [[makiwara]] is a rather universal tool in Okinawan martial arts. It is made from an immovable punching post constructed of wood or some firm material, wrapped in straw or other soft padding. 

The Makiwara is used primarily in the development of the striking surfaces utilized in karate. Unlike a hanging bag, timing, cadence, and footwork are rarely utilized with this implement, instead using it almost solely as a resistance training aide. 

Striking of the makiwara tends to develop the muscles around the joints, strengthening them for the sometimes awkward or unorthodox strikes found in the various types of Ryukyu martial arts. The most common strikes used are straight punches using various hand formations and single, two, and three finger strikes.

=== Kumite ===

[[Kumite]] is the practice of free-sparring, that is, sparring in a non-set pattern.

Shimabuku instituted free-sparring using full [[Kendo]] armor to allow for full-contact training while minimizing the risk of injury.

Current equipment makes free-sparring much easier and safer, allow for a more involved and effective karate training method.

== History ==

=== Tatsuo Shimabuku ===
{{Nihongo|Shimabuku Tatsuo|<U+5CF6><U+888B><U+9F8D><U+592B>}} (1908<U+2013>1975) was born September 19, 1908 in Chan (Jp. Kyan) village, Okinawa.  Shimabuku began training under Shinko Ganeku, his maternal uncle. Ganeku later sent Shimabuku to study karate from [[Chotoku Kyan]].<ref name="Bishop"/> He was around age 23 or 24 at the time (c. 1932). Chotoku Kyan would be his most influential instructor (and after whom he initially named his style ''Chan migwa Te'', with Migwa being a reference to Chotoku Kyan's nickname stemming from his wearing of glasses and his small eyes). He also studied karate with [[Chojun Miyagi]] in Naha for a couple of years beginning in 1936 and from [[Motobu Choki|Choki Motobu]] around 1938 (also in Naha). By 1940, he became the first karateka to ever master both Shorin-Ryu and Goju-Ryu.

Shimabuku opened his first [[dojo]] in Konbu village and began teaching in 1946. On January 15, 1956, he held a meeting and announced that he was naming his new style of karate Isshin-ryu. Shimabuku's number one student, Eiko Kaneshi, was at the meeting and he asked Shimabuku, "Why such a funny name?" Tatsuo replied, "Because all things begin with one."<ref>[http://www.isshinkai.net/history03-birthofisshinryu.html The Birth Of Isshinryu]</ref><ref>[http://www.olemiss.edu/orgs/karate/2008%20commerative.htm The Naming Of Isshinryu]</ref>

At the age of 50 (c. 1959) Shimabuku began studying kobud<U+014D>, the art of old traditional Okinawan weapons. The kobud<U+014D> weapons included were the [[Sai (weapon)|sai]], [[Bo (weapon)|bo]], and [[tonfa]], under [[Shinken Taira]]. He incorporated the kobud<U+014D> that he had learned from Kyan and Taira into the Isshin-ryu system.

=== Megami ===
[[Image:Mizugami.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Megami ("the Goddess"), the symbol of Isshin-ry<U+016B>.]]
{{Nihongo|Isshinryu No Megami|<U+4E00><U+5FC3><U+6D41><U+306E><U+5973><U+795E>}}, or for short, {{Nihongo|[[Megami]]|<U+5973><U+795E>||goddess}} is the symbol of Isshin-ryu.It is represented on the Isshin-ryu crest and is often displayed on the front wall of the dojo next to a picture of Tatsuo Shimabuku. As an emblem for Isshin-ry<U+016B> Tatsuo Shimabuku chose a half-sea-snake half-woman deity whom he had seen in a vision.<ref name="Bishop"/> She represents the strength of the snake and the quiet character of a woman, thus expressing the essence of the style.<ref name="Bishop"/>

Originally the Isshin-ryu emblem was called ''Isshin-ryu No Megami'', which means 'Goddess of Isshinryu.' Some Isshin-ryu karateka also call it either "Miu-gami" or ''Mizu Gami'' (<U+6C34><U+795E>), the latter translating to 'Water Goddess,' (The latter term is incorrect usage according to Isshinryu Karate Master, [[Angi Uezu]] Sensei) Eiko Kaneshi, Tatsuo's right-hand-man who was a Shinto priest, was asked if it was ''Mizu Gami''. He said it has nothing to do with water. Isshin-ryu no Megami, or Megami for short, is correct. This is coroborated by Marien Jumelet who asked Shinsho Shimabuku and Kensho Tokumura what was the correct name. The Goddess is the Goddess of Isshin-ryu karate and not the Goddess of water.

The Isshin-ryu patch is rich with cross-linked symbolism where certain features could and do have three or more intended meanings behind them. Between factions exist variations of the patch, the portrait of the Isshin-ryu no Megami, and the symbols contained therein.

The image represented at right is just one of the many versions of the Isshin-ryu no Megami. The ovular shape of the patch represents the characteristic vertical fist of Isshin-Ryu. The border of the patch is always a warm color<U+2014>usually orange or yellow<U+2014>and represents a ring of fire that appeared in Shimabuku's vision. The Megami is allegedly a mother protecting her child; she is gentle like a mother, but fierce and threatening towards enemies who may harm her child.In this simplified version of the Isshin-ryu no Megami, one important symbol is left out; in the traditional patch depicts the goddess with a raised right fist and a lowered open palm. Her hands represent a well-known saying among karateka: "fierce in battle and gentle in life." The small dragon above the goddess is a sea dragon of Oriental mythology, which was born at the bottom of the sea, but transformed by ascending to the heavens. The dragon is thought to represent Master Shimabuku, who was once called "Dragon Boy" in his youth. The rough seas and grey background depict a terrible typhoon, which represents the uncertainty of the future, and how trouble may arise spontaneously at any time. Finally, the three stars at the top of the patch represent the three tenants of Isshin-ryu: the spiritual, the mental, and the physical. Each of these core symbols are depicted in each patch, regardless of how different they may seem to the untrained eye.

=== Notable Karateka of Shimabuku ===

==== United States Marines of the Third Marine Division (1955-1966) ====
* [[Harold G. Long]] became one of the most influential of Shimabuku's students, forming the [[International Isshin-Ryu Karate Association (IIKA)|International Isshin-Ryu Karate Association]].<ref name="Little">{{cite web|last=Little|first=Phil E.|title=A BRIEF LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF ISSHIN-RYU KARATE IN AMERICA|url=http://www.usika.com/history/tatso-shimabuka/|accessdate=28 March 2012}}</ref> He ended his career having earned the rank of Ju-Dan, and with a space in the Isshin-Ryu Hall of Fame. He is the patriarch of the Long-lineage of Isshin-Ryu. (A lineage is a certain heritage that is formed from sensei to karateka that creates differences between groups of karateka; these differences can be minor or major without changing martial-art.) 

* [[Donald Hugh Nagle]] and Long represented American Isshin-Ryu karate on an international stage after Shimabuku's death in 1975. He ended his career having earned the rank of Ju-Dan, and with a space in the Isshin-Ryu Hall of Fame.

* Steve Armstrong (not to be confused with [[Steve Armstrong]]) also taught Isshin-Ryu to American students, but fell ill sometime after having been awarded eighth-degree black belt.<ref name="Little"/> He is the patriarch of the Armstrong-lineage.

* Harold M. Mitchum was Shimabuku' American students to attain the rank of Hachi-Dan. He has since earned the rank of Ju-Dan, and a space in the Isshin-Ryu Hall of Fame. He is the patriarch of the Mitchum-lineage.

* Arcenio James Advincula was first stationed on Okinawa in late November, 1958. After he had completed his check in sheet and was reporting to his NCOIC he saw a sign for judo classes and he asked the NCOIC about the classes. The NCOIC, who was a Green Belt in Isshinryu, asked him if he would like to try karate and told Advincula that he would take him to meet "Papasan" on Advincula's first liberty. Advincula accepted the invitation and on December 1, 1958 he went to the Agena Dojo and met Shimabuku for the first time. Advincula trained with Shimabuku regularly until his departure from Okinawa nearly fourteen months later. After returning to Alaska in April 1960 he opened his first dojo in Anchorage, teaching out of a health club facility.

==== Okinawan Karateka ====
* Kaneshi Eiko was reportedly Shimabuku's greatest student.

* Kichiro Shimabuku was the son of Tatsuo Shimabuku, and inherited his dojo in early 1972.

== Features ==

Isshin-Ryu employs a [[Vertical direction|vertical]] punch with the fingers tucked in and the thumb on top of the fist. Advantages vary with opinion, but it is usually taught that the thumb placement increases the stability of the wrist when punching, and that a vertical punch strikes with the same force at any range instead of at maximum extension as with a corkscrew style punch. Another advantage is that when punching, the thumb will not get caught on an object as opposed to having the thumb sticking up or out.

In Isshin-Ryu it is believed that the vertical punch is faster than the cork-screw punch: three vertical hand punches can be generated in the time of two cork-screw punches.<ref name="Bishop"/>

Isshin-Ryu arm blocks are performed today with the muscle at the intended contact point as opposed to other styles that block with the bone. By using the two bones and the muscle to form a block, less stress is created against the defender's arm, increasing the ability to absorb a strike.

The original arm blocks were taught with palm up, wrist bent, to form a trapping motion as well as to block and/or strike with the radius bone.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Isshin-Ryu kicks are primarily a "snapping" motion, as opposed to placing primary emphasis on thrusting and follow-through.<ref name="Bishop"/>
