This is a '''list of ice hockey teams in Alberta'''.  It features the leagues they have played for, and championships won.  

Since [[ice hockey|hockey]] was introduced to [[Alberta]] in the 1890s, teams at all levels have come and gone.  While the professional ranks have been confined to the major cities of [[Calgary]] and [[Edmonton]], partially due to geographical isolation from the major eastern and pacific coast centres, [[junior ice hockey|junior]] and [[senior ice hockey|senior]] teams have thrived across the province.

Presently, Alberta is home to two [[National Hockey League]] teams, five [[Western Hockey League]] teams, the 16 team [[Alberta Junior Hockey League]], as well as five Junior B hockey leagues comprising over 50 teams.  The [[National Women's Hockey League]] is represented in Alberta, as are teams competing at the senior, [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport|university]] and college ranks.  

This list does not include teams below the junior age group, or adult teams below Senior AAA.

==Major Professional==
===National Hockey League===
The Edmonton Oilers became the first [[National Hockey League]] team in Alberta as they were absorbed by the NHL when the WHA folded.  The Calgary Flames arrived from [[Atlanta, Georgia]] the following year.

===Western Canada Hockey League===
The [[Western Canada Hockey League]] was the first major-professional league on the prairies. Founded in 1921, it collapsed due to escalating costs in 1926, and was reformed as the Prairie Hockey League from 1926-28.

===World Hockey Association===
The [[World Hockey Association]] had envisioned that franchises in Calgary and Edmonton would create an effective rivalry.  When the Calgary Broncos were unable to start their inagural season, the Oilers were briefly renamed the Alberta Oilers with the intention of splitting games between the two cities.  This plan also failed to materialize.

Both of Alberta's elite women's teams were invited to join the [[National Women's Hockey League]] in 2002.  In 2004, they broke away to form the [[Western Women's Hockey League]] due to the lack of competition in the west.  They returned to the NWHL fold in 2006 following a merger between the two leagues.
