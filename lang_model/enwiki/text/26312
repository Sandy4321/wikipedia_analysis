It is the only sea passage from the [[Persian Gulf]] to the open ocean and is one of the world's most strategically important [[choke point]]s. On the north coast is [[Iran]], and on the south coast is the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Musandam]], an [[exclave]] of [[Oman]].  At its narrowest, the strait is {{convert|21|nmi|km}} wide.<ref name=USEIA01/>

About 20% of the world's [[petroleum]], and about 35% of the petroleum traded by sea, passes through the strait making it a highly important strategic location for international trade.<ref name=USEIA01>{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/countries/regions-topics.cfm?fips=WOTC#hormuz |title=Strait of Hormuz |date=30 December 2011 |work=World Oil Transit Chokepoints |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |accessdate=14 January 2012}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The opening to the Persian Gulf was described, but not given a name, in the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'', a 1st-century mariner's guide:

{{quote|"At the upper end of these Calaei islands is a range of mountains called Calon, and there follows not far beyond, the mouth of the Persian Gulf, where there is much diving for the pearl-mussel. To the left of the straits are great mountains called Asabon and to the right there rises in full view another round and high mountain called Semiramis; between them the passage across the strait is about six hundred stadia; beyond which that very great and broad sea, the Persian Gulf, reaches far into the interior. At the upper end of this gulf there is a market-town designated by law called Apologus, situated near Charaex Spasini and the River Euphrates."|Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, Chapter 35}}

In the 10th to 17th centuries AD, the Kingdom of [[Ormus]], which seems to have given the strait its name, was located here. Scholars, historians and linguists derive<ref>[http://cnnmobile.com/primary/_JDafwf-i5FpcTnlqPT ]</ref>{{dead link|date=January 2012}} the name "Ormuz" from the local [[Persian language|Persian]] word {{lang|fa|<U+0647><U+0648><U+0631><U+0645><U+063A>}} ''Hur-[[Magi|mogh]]'' meaning date palm.<ref>[http://minabcity.ir/HomePage.aspx?TabID=4620&Site=DouranPortal&Lang=fa-IR Minicipality of Minab], (in Persian). Retrieved 30 December 2011.</ref>{{Dubious|Folk Etymologies?|date=April 2012}} In the local dialects of Hurmoz and Minab this strait is still called Hurmogh and has the aforementioned meaning.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}
The resemblance of this word with the name of the Persian god {{lang|fa|<U+0647><U+0631><U+0645><U+0632>}} ''Hormoz'' (a variant of ''[[Ahura Mazda]]'') has resulted in the popular belief{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}{{POV-inline|Folk Etymologies?|date=April 2012}} that these words are related.

==Navigation==
To reduce the risk of collision, ships moving through the Strait follow a [[Traffic Separation Scheme]] (TSS): inbound ships use one lane, outbound ships another, each lane being two miles wide. The lanes are separated by a two-mile-wide "median".

To traverse the Strait, ships pass through the territorial waters of Iran and Oman under the [[transit passage]] provisions of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]].<ref name=UNCLOS-historic>{{cite web |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Strait_of_Hormuz |title=The Encyclopedia of Earth |publisher=National Council for Science and Environment}}</ref> Although not all countries have ratified the convention,<ref name=UNCLOS-ratification>{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/Depts/los/reference_files/chronological_lists_of_ratifications.htm |title=Chronological lists of ratifications of, accessions and successions to the Convention and the related Agreements as at 26 October 2007 |publisher=UN |work=Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea}}</ref> most countries, including the U.S.,<ref>{{Cite document|url=http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/58381.pdf|format=PDF|title=Presidential Proclamation 5030|author=[[U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]|date=10 March 1983|accessdate=21 January 2008|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> accept these customary navigation rules as codified in the Convention.

Oman has a radar site Link Quality Indicator (LQI) to monitor the TSS in the Strait of Hormuz. This site is on a small island on the peak of [[Musandam Governorate|Musandam Peninsula]].

==Traffic statistics==
According to the [[Energy Information Administration|U.S. Energy Information Administration]], in the year 2011, an average of 14 tankers per day passed out of the Persian Gulf through the Strait carrying {{convert|17|Moilbbl|m3}} of crude oil. This was said to represent 35% of the world's seaborne oil shipments and 20% of oil traded worldwide.  The report stated that more than 85% of these crude oil exports went to Asian markets, with Japan, India, South Korea and China the largest destinations.<ref name=USEIA01 />

A 2007 report from the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] also stated that 17 million barrels passed out of the Gulf daily, but that oil flows through the Strait accounted for roughly 40% of all world-traded oil.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/070326_iranoil_hormuz.pdf |title=Iran, Oil, and the Strait of Hormuz|author=Anthony H.

==Events==
===Operation Praying Mantis===
{{Main|Operation Praying Mantis}}
On 18 April 1988, the U.S. Navy waged a one-day battle against Iranian forces in and around the strait. The battle, dubbed [[Operation Praying Mantis]] by the U.S. side was launched in retaliation for mining of the [[USS Samuel B. Roberts (FFG-58)|USS ''Samuel B. Roberts'']] by Iran on 14 April. U.S. forces sank one [[frigate]], one gunboat, and as many as six armed speedboats in the engagement and seriously damaged a second frigate.

===The downing of Iran Air 655===
{{Main|Iran Air Flight 655}}

On 3 July 1988, 290 people were killed when an [[Iran Air]] [[Airbus A300]] passenger jet was shot down over the strait by the [[United States Navy]] [[guided missile]] [[cruiser]] [[USS Vincennes (CG-49)|USS ''Vincennes'']] in a case of mistaken identity.

===Collision between USS ''Newport News'' and tanker ''Mogamigawa''===
On 8 January 2007, the nuclear submarine [[USS Newport News (SSN-750)|USS ''Newport News'']], traveling submerged, struck {{MV|Mogamigawa}}, a 300,000-ton Japanese-flagged very large crude [[Petroleum tanker#Merchant tankers|tanker]], south of the strait.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hamptonroads.com/node/205951 |title=Navy says speed of tanker sucked submarine up to surface |publisher=The Virginian Pilot |date=10 January 2007 |first=Jack |last=Dorsey}}</ref> There were no injuries, and no oil leaked from the tanker.

===Tensions in 2008===
====2008 US-Iranian naval dispute====
{{main|2008 US-Iranian naval dispute}}

A series of naval stand-offs between Iranian speedboats and U.S. warships in the Strait of Hormuz occurred in December 2007 and January 2008. U.S. officials accused Iran of harassing and provoking their naval vessels; Iranian officials denied these allegations. On 14 January 2008, U.S. naval officials appeared to contradict the Pentagon version of the 16th of January event, in which U.S. officials said U.S. vessels were near to firing on approaching Iranian boats. The Navy's regional commander, Vice Admiral [[Kevin Cosgriff]], said the Iranians had "neither anti-ship missiles nor torpedoes" and that he "wouldn't characterize the posture of the US 5th Fleet as afraid of these small boats".<ref>{{cite news |title=A game of chicken in the, Persian Gulf |first=David |last=Isenberg |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/JA10Ak05.html |newspaper=[[Asia Times Online]] |date=10 January 2008 |accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref>

====Iranian defence policy====
On 29 June 2008, the commander of [[Iran's Revolutionary Guard]], [[Mohammad Ali Jafari]], said that if Iran were attacked by Israel or the United States, it would seal off the Strait of Hormuz, to wreak havoc in oil markets.  This statement followed other more ambiguous threats from Iran's oil minister and other government officials that a Western attack on Iran would result in turmoil in oil supply.

In response, Vice Admiral Kevin Cosgriff, commander of the U.S. 5th Fleet stationed in Bahrain across the Persian Gulf from Iran, warned that such an action by Iran would be considered an act of war, and that the U.S. would not allow Iran to effectively hold hostage nearly a third of the world's oil supply.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,374905,00.html|title= U.S. Navy Commander Warns Iran: Don't Try Closing Gulf Oil Passageway|publisher=Fox News |date=2 July 2008}}</ref>

On 8 July 2008, Ali Shirazi, a mid-level clerical aide to Iran's Supreme Leader [[Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]], was quoted by the student news agency [[Iranian Students' News Agency|ISNA]] as saying to Revolutionary Guards, "The Zionist regime is pressuring White House officials to attack Iran. If they commit such a stupidity, Tel Aviv and U.S. shipping in the Persian Gulf will be Iran's first targets and they will be burned."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080708/wl_nm/iran_nuclear_dc_8|title=Iran to "hit Tel Aviv, U.S. ships" if attacked|publisher=Yahoo News |date=8 July 2008}}</ref>

====Naval activity in 2008====
In the last week of July 2008, in the Operation Brimstone,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=38478|title = JTFEX 08-4 "Operation Brimstone" Flexes Allied Force Training|publisher=US Navy|date=15 July 2008}}</ref> dozens of U.S. and foreign navy ships came to off the eastern coast in the U.S., to undergo joint exercises for possible military activity in the shallow waters off the coast of Iran.

As of 11 August 2008, more than 40 U.S. and allied ships reportedly were en route to the Strait of Hormuz. One U.S. carrier battle group from Japan would complement two more, which are already in the Persian Gulf, for a total of five battle groups, not counting submarines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.debka.com/headline.php?hid=5499 |title = Three major US naval strike forces due this week in Persian Gulf|publisher=Debkafile|date=11 August 2008}}</ref>

On 3 January 2012, Iran threatened to take action if the U.S. Navy moves an aircraft carrier back into the Persian Gulf.  Iranian Army chief [[Ataollah Salehi]] said the United States had moved an aircraft carrier out of the Gulf because of Iran's naval exercises, and Iran would take action if the ship returned.  "Iran will not repeat its warning...the enemy's carrier has been moved to the [[Gulf of Oman]] because of our drill.  I recommend and emphasize to the American carrier not to return to the Persian Gulf", he said.<ref>{{cite news |title=Iran threatens U.S. Navy as sanctions hit economy |first=Parisa |last=Hafezi |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/03/us-iran-usa-idUSTRE80208P20120103 |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=3 January 2012 |accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref>

The U.S. Navy spokesman Commander Bill Speaks quickly responded that deployment of U.S. military assets would continue as has been the custom stating: "The U.S. Navy operates under international maritime conventions to maintain a constant state of high vigilance in order to ensure the continued, safe flow of maritime traffic in waterways critical to global commerce."<ref>{{cite news |title=Iran nuclear crisis: Sanctions 'beginning to bite' |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-16396345 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=3 January 2012 |accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref>

The U.S. led sanctions may be "beginning to bite" as Iranian currency has recently lost some 12% of its value.  Further pressure on Iranian currency was added by French Foreign Minister [[Alain Jupp<U+00E9>]] who was quoted as calling for more "strict sanctions" and urged EU countries to follow the US in freezing Iranian central bank assets and imposing an embargo on oil exports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/video/us-22424932/state-department-iran-is-feeling-the-pressure-27769481.html |title=State Department: Iran is feeling the pressure - Yahoo!

On 9 January 2012, Iranian Defense Minister [[Ahmad Vahidi]] denied that Iran had ever claimed that it would close the Strait of Hormuz, saying that "the Islamic Republic of Iran is the most important provider of security in the strait... if one threatens the security of the Persian Gulf, then all are threatened."<ref>{{cite web|title=Iran and the Strait of Hormuz|url=http://subyraman.com/iran-and-the-strait-of-hormuz/|work=Tabeer}}</ref>

He indicated that tensions involving the Strait of Hormuz are leading those currently dependent on shipments from the Gulf to find alternative shipping capabilities.  He stated that Saudi Arabia was considering building new pipelines to [[Oman]] and [[Yemen]], and that Iraq might revive the disused Iraq-[[Syria]] pipeline to ship crude to the Mediterranean.  Luft stated that reducing Hormuz traffic "presents the West with a new opportunity to augment its current Iran containment strategy."<ref name=FPluft0 />
