'''Jeddah''' (also spelled '''Jiddah''', '''Jidda''', or '''Jedda'''; {{lang-ar|'''<U+062C><U+062F><U+0651><U+0629>'''}} ''Jidda'') is a [[Saudi Arabia]]n city located on the coast of the [[Red Sea]] and is the major urban center of western Saudi Arabia. It is the largest city in [[Makkah Province]], and the second largest city in Saudi Arabia after the capital city, [[Riyadh]]. The population of the city currently stands at over 3.4 million. It is considered the second commercial capital of Saudi Arabia<ref>[http://www.alriyadh.com/2006/01/12/article122435.html An article in Al-Riyadh Newspaper]</ref>.

Jeddah is the principal gateway to [[Mecca]], [[Islam]]'s holiest city, which able-bodied [[Muslim]]s are required to visit at least once in their lifetime.

Residents of Jeddah are called ''Jeddans''. Jeddah has 24 [[Town twinning|sister cities]], which are selected based on economic, cultural and political criteria.

==Etymology and spelling==
There are at least two explanations for the etymology of the name '''Jeddah'''. According to ''Jeddah Ibn Helwaan Al-Qudaa'iy'' the chief of Quda'a clan. The more common account has it that the name is derived from '''Jaddah''', the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for "grandmother". According to eastern folk belief, the tomb of [[Eve (Bible)|Eve]] ({{coord|21|29|31|N|39|11|24|E}}), considered the grandmother of humanity, is located in Jeddah. The purported "[[Eve Grave|Grave of Eve]]" was sealed with concrete by the religious authorities in 1975 as a result of some Muslims praying at the site.

[[Ibn Battuta]], the [[Berber people|Berber]] traveller, visited Jeddah during his world trip. He wrote the name of the city into his diary as '''Juddah'''.<ref>Ibn Battota's Safari :Tuhfat Al-Nothaar Fe Gharaa'ib Al-Amsaar - Chapter: From Cairo to Hejaz to Tunisia again , ISBN 9-953341-80-X</ref>

The [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|British Foreign Office]], used to use the older spelling of '''Jedda''', contrary to other English-speaking usage<U+2014>including other branches of the British government, but in 2007 changed to the spelling '''Jeddah'''.<ref>[http://www.britishembassy.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1025870059850&a=KArticle&aid=1186674133138] British Embassy website</ref>

[[T. E. Lawrence]] felt that any transcription of [[Arabic]] names into English was arbitrary. In his book "Revolt in the Desert" Jeddah is spelled three different ways on the first page alone.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeddah&action=edit&section=1] Lost in translation. Brian Whitaker. Guardian (UK)</ref>

On official Saudi maps and documents, the city name is transcribed "Jeddah", which is now the prevailing usage.

==History==
[[Image:Jeddah 1924.jpg|thumb|right|Jeddah in 1924]]
[[Image:Jeddah-1938.jpeg|thumb|right|Jeddah in 1938]]
The city was founded as a fishing hamlet over 2000 years ago by the Yemeni Quada tribe that's left central Yemen to settle Makkah.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}{{When|date=June 2009}} but first achieved prominence in 647 A.D., when the third Muslim [[caliph]] [[Uthman Ibn Affan]] turned it into a [[port]] for Muslim pilgrims making the required [[Hajj]] to Mecca.

Jeddah was for centuries the main city of the historic [[Hejaz]] province and historic port for pilgrims arriving by sea on their pilgrimage or Hajj to Mecca.

Hejaz - including Jeddah - became a part of the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid Empire]] in 1177 during the leadership of [[Sharif of Mecca|Sharif]] Ibn Abul-Hashim Al-Thalab (1094 - 1201).

===Mamluk Sultanate===
In 1254, following events in [[Cairo]], [[Hejaz]] became a part of the [[Mamluk|Mamluk Sultanate]]. [[Vasco da Gama]], having in 1497 CE found his way round the [[Cape]] and obtained pilots from the coast of [[Zanzibar]], pushed his way across the [[Indian Ocean]] to the shores of [[Malabar]] and [[Calcutta]], attacked the fleets that carried freight and [[Muslim]] [[pilgrims]] from [[India]] to the [[Red Sea]], and struck terror into the potentates all around. The Princes of [[Gujarat]] and [[Yemen]] turned for help to [[Egypt]]. Sultan '''[[Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri]]''' accordingly fitted out a fleet of 50 vessels under his Admiral, '''Hussein the Kurd'''. Jeddah by forced labor was soon fortified as a harbor of refuge from the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], and [[Arabia]] and the [[Red Sea]] were protected. But the fleets in the [[Indian Ocean]] were at the mercy of the enemy.

===Ottoman Empire===
In 1517, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] conquered the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt and Syria, during the reign of [[Selim I]].<ref name="History of Arabia">[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-45995 britannica.com]</ref> As territories of the Mamluk Sultanate, the Hejaz, including the holy city of Mecca and Jeddah, passed into Ottoman possession. The Ottomans rebuilt the weak walls of Jeddah in 1525 following their victory over [[Portuguese Gold Coast|Lopo Soares de Albergaria's Armada]] in the Red Sea.
The new Turkish wall included six [[watchtower]]s and six [[city gate]]s. They were constructed to defend against the Portuguese attack. Of the six gates, the '''Gate of Mecca''' was the eastern gate and the '''Gate of [[Maghreb|Al-Magharibah]]''', facing the port, the western one. The '''Gate of Sharif''' was south facing. The other gates were the '''Gate of Al-Bunt''', '''Gate of Al-Sham''' (also called Gate of Al-Sharaf) and '''Gate of [[Medina]]''' facing north.<ref>Asia Rooms.com - [http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/saudi-arabia/jeddah/jeddah-sightseeing/makkah-gate-in-jeddah.html Makkah Gate in Jeddah]</ref> The Turks also built the [[The Qishla of Jeddah]], a small castle for the city soldiers. In the 19th century these seven gates were minimized into four giant gates with four towers. These giant gates were the '''Gate of Sham''' from the north, the '''Gate of Mecca''' from the east, the '''Gate of Sharif''' from the south, and the '''Gate of Al-Magharibah''' on the sea side.

[[Ahmed Al-Jazzar]], the Ottoman military man mainly known for his role in the [[Siege of Acre (1799)|Siege of Acre]], has spent an earlier part of his career at Jeddah - where in 1750 he killed some seventy rioting nomads in retaliation for the killing of his commander Abdullah Beg. It was this act which reportedly earned him the nickname "Jezzar" (butcher), which he carried for the rest of his life.

===First Saudi State and Ottoman-Saudi War===
{{Main|Ottoman-Saudi War}}
In 1802, [[First Saudi State|Nejdi forces]] conquered both Mecca and Jeddah from the Ottomans; when Sharif [[Ghalib Efendi]] informed [[Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] of this, the Sultan ordered his [[Egypt]]ian viceroy [[Muhammad Ali|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] to re-take the city. Muhammad Ali successfully regained the city during [[Battle of Jeddah]] in 1813.

===World War I and The Kingdom of Hejaz===
[[Image:DSC00001 Abu Zenada.JPG|thumb|right|Mohammed Abu Zenada , one of Chiefs of Jeddah and the advisor of the [[Ali of Hejaz|Sharif]] during the surrender to [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud]] in 1925]]
{{Main|Arab Revolt|Kingdom of Hejaz}}
During [[World War I]], Sharif [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Hussein bin Ali]] declared a revolt against the [[Ottoman Empire]] seeking independence from the Ottoman Turks and the creation of a single unified [[Arab]] state spanning from [[Aleppo]] in [[Syria]] to [[Aden]] in [[Yemen]].

King Hussein declared the [[Kingdom of Hejaz]]. Later, Hussein was involved in war with [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Ibn Saud]], who was the Sultan of [[Nejd]]. Hussein resigned following the fall of [[Mecca]], in December 1924, and his son [[Ali of Hejaz|Ali bin Hussein]] became the new king of the remaining soil of the Kingdom of Hejaz.

===Kingdom of Saudi Arabia===
A few months later, [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Ibn Saud]], whose clan originated in the central [[Nejd]] province, conquered [[Medina]], and Jeddah, via an agreement with Jeddans, following the events of the [[Battle of Jeddah 1925|Second Battle of Jeddah]]. He deposed the [[Sharif of Hejaz]], [[Ali of Hejaz|Ali bin Hussein]], who fled to [[Baghdad]], settling eventually in [[Amman]], [[Jordan]], where his descendants became the [[Hashemite]] royal family.

As a result, Jeddah came under the sway of the [[House of Saud|Al-Saud dynasty]] in December 1925. In 1926, Ibn Saud added the title King of Hejaz to his position of Sultan of Nejd. Today, Jeddah has lost its historical role in peninsular politics, since the historic Hejaz province along the west coast has been subdivided into smaller provinces, with Jeddah falling within the new province of Makkah with its provincial capital at Mecca.

From 1928 to 1932 the new Khuzam Palace was built as the new residence of King Abdul Aziz in Jeddah. The palace lies south of the old walled city and was constructed under the supervision of the engineer Muhammad bin Laden. After 1963 the palace was used as a royal guest house and since 1995 houses the Regional Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography.<ref>Leaflet for Khuzam Palace Jeddah, Deputy Ministry of Antiquities & Museums</ref>

What was left of the walls and gates of the old city was taken down in 1947. A fire in 1982 destroyed some ancient buildings in the old town center, called the [[AL-Balad, Jeddah|Balad]], but much is still preserved despite the commercial interest to tear down old houses and build modern high rise buildings. A house by house survey of the old districts was made in 1979, showing that some 1000 traditional buildings still existed, though the number of structures with great historic value was far less. In 1990 a Jeddah Historical Area Preservation Department was founded.<ref>[http://www.saudiembassy.net/Publications/MagWinter99/preserving.htm Preserving Jeddah's Historic Buildings]</ref>,<ref>The [http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/saudi-arabia/jeddah/jeddah-sightseeing/biet-nassif-in-jeddah.html Biet Nassif in Jeddah] on www.asiarooms.com.</ref>

The modern city has expanded wildly beyond its old boundaries. The built up area expanded mainly to the north along the Red Sea coastline, reaching the new airport during the last decade of the last century and since edging its way around it towards the "Ob'hur Creek" some 27 kilometers from the old city center.

==Geography==
Most of Saudi Arabia is [[desert]]. The central region consists of an eroded [[plateau]], mostly [[arid]] and hot in the summer and cold in the winter. The western region is [[mountain]]ous, except for the [[coastal plain]] bordering the Red Sea such as the Jeddah area.

Jeddah borders the Red Sea from the west and the [[Sarawat Mountains|Al-Sarawat Mountains]] from the east. It has no rivers or valleys but it includes ''[[Headlands and bays|Sharm]] Ob'hur'' which connect the Red Sea to the other end of the city. ''[[Headlands and bays|Sharm]] of Salman'' (Also called ''Gulf of Salman'') borders the city from north.

===Climate===
Unlike other Saudi Arabian cities, Jeddah retains its warm temperature in winter, which can range from +15 [[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]] (59 [[Fahrenheit|<U+00B0>F]]) at midnight to +25 <U+00B0>C (77 <U+00B0>F) in the afternoon. Summer temperatures are considered very hot and break the +40 <U+00B0>C (104 <U+00B0>F) mark in the afternoon dropping to +30 <U+00B0>C (86 <U+00B0>F) in the evening. Rainfall in Jeddah is generally sparse, and usually occurs in small amounts in December. There have also been several notable incidents of hail. Heavy thunderstorms are not uncommon in winter. (The thunderstorm of December 2008 being the largest in recent memory, with rain reaching around 3 inches.) The lowest temperature ever recorded in Jeddah was 3<U+00B0>C (37.4<U+00B0>F) in the winter of 1995.

Some unusual events often happen during the year, such as [[dust storm]]s in summer, coming from the [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian Peninsula's]] deserts or from [[North Africa]].

===Pollution and environment===
Air pollution remains to some degree an issue for Jeddah, particularly on the hot summer days. The city has experienced a number of bush fires, [[landfill]] fires and even pollution caused by the two industrial zones in the north and the south of Jeddah.

The water treatment factory and the [[Jeddah Seaport|seaport]] contribute to water pollution. However, the coast of the city can be considered safe, and of relatively clean quality.

Unlike the pollution of Riyadh which may be considered to be unclean and disrespectful to the environment{{Dubious|date=June 2009}}, Jeddah has created and enforced extremely strict environmental laws{{Fact|date=June 2009}}.

==Economy==
With a thousand years of trading behind it and home to some of the world's most successful merchants and business people, it is natural that Jeddah is the second commercial capital of Saudi Arabia. In addition, the city's geographical location places it at the heart of the region covered by the [[Middle East]] and North Africa, with all their capitals within two hours flying distance, defining Jeddah as the second commercial center of the Middle East after of Riyadh.<ref>Saudi Arabian Water & Power Forum, www.ksawpf.com -- [http://www.ksawpf.com/index.php?page=jeddah#commercial Commerce of Jeddah]</ref>

Also, Jeddah industrial district is the four largest industrial city in Saudi Arabia after [[Riyadh]], [[Jubail]] and [[Yanbu]].
===King Abdullah Street===
King Abdullah Street is an important place for companies' offices and commercial developments. The street hosts some of the most powerful [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] in Saudi Arabia such as [[Emaar Properties|Emaar Middle East]] and Al-Farsi. Due to the economic boom in this region there is a central business district planned which would be one of the biggest CBD in the eastern world.

===Tahlia Street===
{{Main|Tahlia Street}}
Tahlia Street is an important fashion and shopping street in the mid-town of Jeddah. It contains many upscale department shops, and boutiques, such as [[Prada]], [[Gucci]], [[Burberry]], [[Chanel]] and [[Giorgio Armani]].

===Major organizations headquartered in Jeddah===
[[Image:DSC00020-JCCI.JPG|thumb|right|Jeddah Chamber of Commerce & Industry]]
The city has several global and major organizations such as:
* [[Saudi Geological Survey]]
* [[Saudi Arabian Airlines]]
* [[Organization of the Islamic Conference]]
* [[Islamic Development Bank]]
* [[Jeddah Economic Forum]]
* Saudi Arabia's Human Rights Organization
* [[Jeddah Chamber of Commerce & Industry]]
* [[Jeddah Marketing Board]]
* [[International Association of Islamic Banks]]
* Islamic Shipowners Association
* Islamic States Broadcasting Organization
* [http://www.alahli.com The National Commercial Bank]

==Demographics==
Popular Saudi and foreign opinion regards Jeddah as the most liberal and cosmopolitan of Saudi cities due to its historic role as port and gateway to the holy city of Mecca. For over one thousand years, Jeddah has received millions of pilgrims of different [[Ethnic group|ethnicities]] and backgrounds, from [[Africa]], [[Central Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Europe]] and the Middle East, many of whom remained and became residents of the city. As a result, Jeddah is much more ethnically diverse than most Saudi cities and its culture more eclectic in nature (in contrast with the more geographically isolated, [[Homogeneity|homogeneous]], and religiously strict capital Riyadh). Added to the traditional diversity, the oil-boom of the past 50 years has brought hundreds of thousands of working [[Immigration|immigrants]] and [[foreign worker]]s from non-Muslim countries, the majority originating from continents such as North America (United States of America), Europe (Western Europe), and Asia (South and South-East Asia); there are also many Christian Arabs from the Middle East{{Fact|date=December 2008}}, coming from [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], and the West Bank and Gaza.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}.

==Culture==
===Religious significance===
[[Image:A Lady from Jeddah 1873.JPG|thumb|right|A Lady from Jeddah , This photograph was taken in 1873. It shows an example of traditional woman's clothing of the past.]]
The vast majority of Jeddans are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]], with a minority of [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]], and Asian, Western, and Arab [[Christianity|Christians]]{{Fact|date=December 2008}}. There are also non-Muslim/non-Christian Asians. There are no non-Muslim citizens; while there are Muslims who are not citizens, all non-Muslims are resident [[expatriate]] workers. The city has over 1,300 [[Mosque]]s,<ref>Al-Sharq Al-Awsat Newspaper - [http://www.asharqalawsat.com/details.asp?section=43&issue=10110&article=376124 Report about number of mosques]</ref> and has no [[Church (building)|Churches]], [[Synagogue]]s, or other types of places of worship; non-Muslims are also strictly not allowed to celebrate their religion in any way openly. However, some [[Philippines|Filipino]] workers report the presence of Churches inside some [[Gated community|Gated communities]].{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

Since the 7th century, Jeddah has hosted millions of Muslim pilgrims from all over the world in their way to [[Hajj]]. This merge with pilgrims has also a major impact on the society, religion, and economy of Jeddah.

There is a ban on Alcohol and Narcotics all over the Kingdom. Anyone found to be involved in usage or handling of Alcohol and Narcotics is severely punished under "Saudi Rule Of Law" (which is derived mainly from "Islamic [[Sharia]]").

All business activities and markets are closed (five times a day) during prayer times.

The Court and Justice System of Saudi Arabia follows Islamic Codes.

===Cuisine===
[[Image:Kabsa.jpg|thumb|left|Saudi [[Kabsa]]]]

Jeddah residents are a mix of several different ethnicities and nationalities. This mixture of races has made a major impact on Jeddah's traditional cuisine.

Like other Saudi cities, The [[Nejdi]] [[Kabsa]] is the most traditional lunch for Jeddan people. The [[Yemeni]] [[Mandi (food)|Mandi]] is also popular as a lunch meal. Hejazi cuisine is popular as well and dishes like Mabshoor, Mitabbak, Foul, Migalgal, Kibdah, Ma'asoob can be acquired in many traditional restaurants around the city such as Althamrat, Abo-Zaid, Al-Quarmooshi, Ayaz, and Hejaziyat .

Grilled meat has a good market in Jeddah such as [[Shawarma]], [[Kofta]] and [[Kebab]]. During [[Ramadan]] [[Sambusac|Sambousak]] and [[Ful medames|Ful]] are the most popular meals during [[Dusk]]. These meals are almost found in Lebanese, Syrian, and Turkish restaurants.

International food is also popular in the city. American chains such as [[McDonald's]], [[Burger King]], [[Domino's Pizza]] and [[KFC]], among others are widely distributed in Jeddah, as are more upscale chains like [[Fuddruckers]] and [[Chili's]]. Chinese, Japanese, and other Eastern/Asian food are also popular. European restaurants, such as Italian and French, are also found throughout the city.

===Open-air art===
During the oil boom in the late 1970s and 1980s, there was a focused civic effort at bringing art to Jeddah's [[Public space|public areas]]. As a result, Jeddah contains a large number of modern open air sculptures and works of art, typically situated in [[roundabout]]s, which makes it to this day the largest open-air art gallery in the world. Sculptures include works by a variety of artists, ranging from the obscure to international stars such as [[Jean/Hans Arp]], [[C<U+00E9>sar Baldaccini]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Joan Mir<U+00F3>]] and [[Victor Vasarely]] and often depict elements of traditional Saudi culture - coffee pots, incense burners, palm trees, etc. The fact that Islamic tradition prohibits the depiction of living creatures, notably the human form, has made for some very creative modern art, ranging from the tasteful to the bizarre and downright hideous. These include a mounted defunct propeller plane, a giant geometry set, a giant bicycle, and a huge block of concrete with several cars protruding out of it at odd angles.

===Museums and collections===
There may be about a dozen museums or collections in Jeddah.<ref>[http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/saudi-arabia/jeddah/jeddah-museums/index.html Museums in Jeddah] at www.asiarooms.com</ref> Some of these, showing a wide variety of educational aim and professionality, are the [[Jeddah Regional Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography]] run by the Deputy Ministry of Antiquities and Museums, the Jeddah Municipal Museum, the Naseef House, the private Abdul Rauf Hasan Khalil Museum and the private Arts Heritage Museum.

===Media===
Jeddah is served by four major Arabic-language newspapers, [[Asharq Al-Awsat]], Al-Madina, Okaz, Al-Bilad, as well as two major English-language newspapers, The [[Saudi Gazette]] and Arab News. Okaz and Al-Madina are Jeddah's and some other Saudi cities' primary newspaper with over a million readers focusing mainly on issues that affect the city.

Jeddah is the largest radio and television market in [[Saudi Arabia]]. Television stations serving the city area include Saudi TV1, Saudi TV2, Saudi TV Sports, Al-Ekhbariya, [[Arab Radio and Television Network|ART channels network]] and hundreds of cable, satellite and other specialty television providers.

The Jeddah TV Tower is a {{m to ft|250|abbr=yes|precision=0}} high television tower with an observation deck at Jeddah. The tower started construction in 2006 and finished in 2007 and is a part of the new branch of Ministry of Information in Jeddah.

===Sport===
Jeddah hosts the oldest sport clubs in Saudi Arabia. [[Al-Ittihad (Jeddah)|Al-Ittihad]] was the first club in the country, being established in 1928.

[[Football (soccer)|Football]] is the most popular sport in Jeddah. [[Al-Ittihad (Jeddah)|Al-Ittihad]] and [[Al-Ahli (Jeddah)|Al-Ahli]] are well known football clubs. They are major competitors in both the [[Saudi Premier League]] and the [[AFC Champions League]]. They have also won the [[FIBA Asia Champions Cup]].

There are several public football stadiums in Jeddah, such as:
* [[Prince Abdullah al-Faisal Stadium]]
* [[Prince Sultan bin Fahd Stadium]]
* [[King Abdulaziz University|KAU Stadium]]
* Air-Defense Forces Stadium
* Schools League Stadium
* King Abdullah Stadium (''Underconstruction'')

===Accent===
{{Main|Hejazi Arabic}}
The Jeddah City area has a distinctive regional speech pattern called the Hejazi dialect, alternatively known as Meccan or Makkawi. It is often considered to be one of the most recognizable accents within the Arabic language.

Pronunciations in Hejazi differ from other Gulf dialects in some respects. The Classical Arabic qaaf (<U+0642>) is pronounced as /g/ sound, as in "get". Hijazi Arabic is also conservative with respect to the sound of the pronunciation of the letter <U+011F>im (<U+062C>), which is very close to the two sounds considered, by specialists, to be the best candidates for the way it was pronounced in Classical Arabic, namely, the voiced palatal plosive /<U+025F>/ and the palatalized velar stop /g<U+02B2>/.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} This stands in contrast with many dialects in the region which use /g/ or /<U+0292>/ for <U+011F>im instead. Some speakers replace the interdental /<U+03B8>/ with /t/ or /s/.

The Hejazi dialect also contains fairly recent borrowings from other Arabic dialects, including [[Levantine Arabic|Levantine]] and [[Egyptian Arabic]].

===Life===
Life in Jeddah is different from many cities in [[Saudi Arabia]] for many reasons. Firstly, Jeddah is a [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] city, more so than any other city in the country; it has many people coming from all over the world, who share their cultures. Secondly, it has many historical buildings,<ref>http://www.lclark.edu/~krauss/culturecapsulesf2001/Al-Faris%20web/images/oldb41.jpg</ref> with traditional designs, and it has lots of buildings near the beach.<ref>http://www.lclark.edu/~krauss/culturecapsulesf2001/Al-Faris%20web/images/0009m.jpg</ref> It also has very nice beaches and a Corniche<ref>http://www.lclark.edu/~krauss/culturecapsulesf2001/Al-Faris%20web/images/JB01.jpg</ref> where people spend a very good time and relax. Also, Jeddah has the tallest fountain<ref>http://www.lclark.edu/~krauss/culturecapsulesf2001/Al-Faris%20web/images/gZ37960.jpg</ref> in the world, named King Fahd Fountain. Last but not least, it has the annual Jeddah Festival. During the festival, there are many games and activities held in the city. There are shopping sprees, water skiing competitions, art exhibitions, and music festivals. Not only that, the prices of the things that are sold there are reasonably cheap. It also has a great shopping district on Tahlia Street, with many designer names available.
