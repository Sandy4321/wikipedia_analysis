'''''Halo 3''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Bungie]] exclusively for the [[Xbox 360]]. The game is the third title in the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' series]] and concludes the [[story arc]] that began in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' and continued in ''[[Halo 2]]''.<ref name="announcement">{{cite web |url = http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&link=Halo3Announcement |title = Halo 3 Announced |accessdate = 2007-08-06 |author =  Achronos |authorlink = Bungie Studios|date = [[2006-05-09]]|work = [[Bungie.net]]}}</ref> The game was released on September 25, 2007 in Australia, Brazil, India, New Zealand, North America, and Singapore;<ref name=releasedate /> September 26, 2007 in Europe; and September 27, 2007 in Japan.

''Halo 3''{{'}}s story centers on the interstellar war between 26th century humanity, led by the [[United Nations Space Command]], and a collection of alien races known as the [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]]. The player assumes the role of the [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]], a cybernetically-enhanced supersoldier, as he wages war in defense of humanity, assisted by human [[Marine (military)|Marine]]s as well as an allied alien race called [[Elite (Halo)|Elite]]s, which is led by the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]]. The game features vehicles, weapons, and gameplay not present in previous titles of the series,<ref>{{cite book | year=2007 | editor=[[Bungie Studios]] | title=''Halo 3'' Instruction Manual | pages=6 | publisher=[[Microsoft Game Studios]]}}</ref> as well as the addition of saved gameplay films, file sharing, and the Forge map editor; a utility which allows the player to perform modifications to multiplayer levels.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Halo3 campaign ss.png|thumb|left|[[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] aims his Assault Rifle at a group of [[Covenant (Halo)#Grunts|Grunts]]. An activated equipment, called the bubble shield, is shown.]]
The gameplay of ''Halo 3'' builds upon the previous iterations of the franchise; it is a [[first-person shooter]] which takes place on foot, but also includes segments focused on [[vehicle|vehicular]] combat. The balance of weapons and objects in the game was adjusted to better adhere to what [[Bungie Studios]] Multiplayer Designer Lars Bakken describes as the "Golden Triangle of ''Halo''".<ref name="golden">Bakken, Lars. "[[Marketing for Halo 3#"Is Quisnam Protero Damno!"|Is Quisnam Protero Damno!]]" [[Bungie Studios]], 2007. (in English)</ref> These are "weapons, grenades, and melee", which are available to a player in most situations. ''Halo 3'' contains the ability to dual-wield, where a player forgoes grenades and melee attacks in favor of the combined firepower of two weapons simultaneously. Most weapons available in previous installments of the series return with minor cosmetic and power alterations. Unlike previous installments, the player's secondary weapon is visible on their player model, holstered or slung across the player's back.<ref name="1up prev">{{cite web|author=Smith, Luke|date=2006-11-06|url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=2&cId=3155028|title=''Halo 3'' Xbox 360 Preview|publisher=[[1up.com]]|accessdate=2007-10-25}}</ref> ''Halo 3'' introduces "support weapons", which are exceptionally large, powerful, and cumbersome two-handed weapons which drastically limit the player's normal combat options and slow them significantly, but offer greatly increased firepower in return.<ref name="ignburning">{{cite web |url = http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/812/812177p1.html |title = Burn, Baby!

''Halo 3'' also adds new features not directly related to gameplay. One such feature, known as 'Forge', is a map-editing tool that enables players to insert and remove game objects, such as weapons and crates, into existing multiplayer maps.<ref name="Bungie-podcast082707" /> Almost all weapons, vehicles, and interactive objects can be placed and moved on maps with Forge.<ref name="BWU-07-08-03">{{cite web |url = http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&cid=12685 |title = Bungie Weekly Update: 08/03/07 |accessdate = 2007-08-05 |author = O'Connor, Frank |date = [[2007-08-03]] |work = [[Bungie.net]] |archiveurl = http://nikon.bungie.org/bwu/index.html?item=139 |archivedate = 2007-08-04 |quote = [...] placed a RIDICULOUS number of exploding fusion cores [...] respawn times set to as close to "instant" as Forge allows [...]}}</ref> Players can enter Forge games and edit and manipulate objects in real time.

===Campaign===
''Halo 3''{{'}}s campaign contains nine levels, which complete the storyline of the ''Halo'' trilogy. The campaign can be played through alone, with two-players on one Xbox 360, or played [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperatively with up to three other players]] via [[Xbox Live]] or [[System Link]].<ref name="soundofsack" /> Instead of having each player be an identical [[SPARTAN-II Project|Spartan]] as in previous ''Halo'' games, the first player plays as [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]], the second player plays as the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] and the other two players control two other [[Elite (Halo)|Elite]]s; [[List of Halo characters#N'tho 'Sraom|N'tho 'Sraom]] and [[List of Halo characters#Usze 'Taham|Usze 'Taham]], each with their own backstories.

''Halo 3''{{'}}s campaign features a scoring method called the "[[Metagaming|meta-game]]", which can introduce a competitive aspect to cooperative play. Players are awarded points for defeating enemies while completing a level in the campaign. Extra points are awarded for certain actions (such as performing [[headshot]]s or defeating multiple enemies in rapid succession), and are lost if the player dies or kills a team-mate. Hidden [[skull]]s (based on the [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]] skulls in ''[[Halo 2]]'') can be found on each level and then subsequently activated before future missions to cause changes in the gameplay; such as giving the enemies extra health, changing in-game [[dialogue]], or modifying a specific A.I. behavior.<ref>{{cite web|author=Smith, Luke|url=http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&cid=12828|title=Get the Most Out of Skulls|publisher=[[Bungie.net]]|date=2007-10-03|accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref> These skulls, as well as the difficulty level and the speed at which the level is completed, provide multipliers to the total score.<ref name="edge179" /> Players are awarded [[Xbox Live#Gamerscore|gamerscore]] points for successfully reaching a certain score in each level,<ref name="Achievements">{{cite web |url = http://www.xbox360achievements.org/achievements.php?gameID=274 |title = Halo 3 Achievements |accessdate = 2007-07-30 |author = Bungie |date = 2007-06-19 |publisher =Xbox360Achievements.org }}</ref> and medals are awarded for specific accomplishments.

===Multiplayer===
 
On a single console, up to two players can play campaign and up to four can participate in a versus multiplayer match through use of [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]]. Through use of [[local area network|LAN]] or [[Xbox Live]], up to four players can play together in campaign, up to eight can customize a map in Forge mode, and up to sixteen can participate in versus multiplayer matches. (Each console must retain their respective split screen limitations.) A public [[beta test]] of the game's online multiplayer features, as well as saved films and file share, took place four months before the full release.<ref name=multiplayermadness>{{cite web |url = http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&link=MPBetaAndVidocRelease |title = Inside Bungie: Multiplayer Madness! |accessdate = 2007-04-17 |author = O'Connor, Frank |date = [[2007-04-10]] |publisher = [[Bungie.net]] |quote = The Halo 3 Multiplayer Beta will go live on May 16th at 12:00 AM PDT and run through June 6th at 11:59 PM PDT}}</ref> Statistics from all games that are completed by players while connected to Xbox Live are also uploaded to the respective player's "service record" on Bungie.net.

Players must actively seek out other players through their [[Xbox Live]] Friends list, using the party invite system, or the LAN search feature to play multiplayer matches with their own custom rules and customized maps. If they are connected to Xbox Live however, a player can choose to have the game decide for them the exact rules and map to play on, as well as finding additional people to play against or with, using the "Matchmaking" system (the automated grouping of players of similar skill). A player will decide from a selection of developer designed "playlists" which each contain a certain way to experience the game. The games contained within a playlist can range from 1 vs 1 free for all, to 8 vs 8 team play. Often focusing on either [[Deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] games (known as "Slayer" in Halo), objective games (e.g. [[Capture the flag#Software and games|Capture the Flag]]) or a combination of the two.<ref name="MMplaylists">{{cite web  | url = http://www.bungie.net/online/Playlists.aspx?mode=1 | title = Matchmaking Playlists | accessdate = 2008-10-03 | last = Armstrong | first = Chad "Shishka" | authorlink = Bungie | date = 2008-10-03 | format = HTML | work = Bungie Online | publisher = Bungie LLC  | location = Seattle, Washington, USA  | archiveurl = | archivedate =  | quote = Variety of different Playlists (or "Hoppers") that you can join with your friends, or solo }}</ref> The playlists are regularly updated; either to remove unpopular types of games or map variants, fix ones that do not work well, or to introduce entirely new gametypes or whole playlists. 

Like other multiplayer Xbox 360 titles, ''Halo 3'' uses a customized version of [[TrueSkill]] ranking system for its matchmaking on a per-playlist basis (i.e. a player's performance in one playlist will not affect who they are matched against in another playlist). On top of this, a linear measure of a player's experience with the matchmade portion of the game and each particular playlist (as of TU2) is also tracked (denoted as [[Experience point|XP]]).<ref name="1up-3155479"> {{cite web |url = http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3155479 |title = The Five Best Things About Halo 3 |accessdate = 2007-04-28 |author= Smith, Luke |date = [[2006-11-24]] |f |work = [[1up.com]] }}</ref> Rank insignia are unlocked and displayed by a player's Gamertag as they attain certain totals of XP (and/or skill level).

==Synopsis==
===Setting=== 
''Halo 3'', like its predecessors, is set in the fictional Halo universe, taking place during the year 2553. According to the backstory, humans developed [[faster-than-light]] travel (using a Shaw-Fujikawa engine attached to a regular space shuttle) and colonized hundreds of planets before encountering the alien [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]] in 2525.<ref name=timeline>{{cite web|author=Bungie|url=http://halosm.bungie.org/story/halostory.timeline.html|title=Ancillary: Halo Story Timeline|publisher=[[Halo.Bungie.Org]]|accessdate=2007-10-04}}</ref> The Covenant declared humanity an affront to their gods and began [[vitrification|destroying]] human colonies by glassing out the entire planet. Despite efforts to keep the Covenant from finding Earth, a Covenant fleet discovered humanity's homeworld during ''[[Halo 2]]''.<ref>{{cite book | year=2007 | editor=[[Bungie Studios]] | title=''Halo 3'' Instruction Manual | publisher=[[Microsoft Game Studios]]}}</ref> By the beginning of ''Halo 3'', the Covenant have arrived in full force on Earth, with most human resistance crushed.

The titular 'Halo' refers to [[Halo (megastructure)|massive ringworlds]] several hundred kilometers in diameter that are scattered across the galaxy. These rings were constructed thousands of years ago by an enigmatic race known as the [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunners]] as a weapon of last resort against the parasitic alien species known as the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]]. When activated, the seven Halos would destroy all [[sentience|sentient]] life in the galaxy, thereby depriving the Flood of its food.<ref>'''Cortana''': You have no idea how this ring works, do you? Why the forerunners built it? Halo doesn't kill flood, it kills their food. Humans, covenant, whatever. We're all equally edible. The only way to stop the flood is to starve them to death. And that's exactly what Halo is designed to do; wipe the galaxy clean of all sentient life. - {{cite video game| title = [[Halo: Combat Evolved]]| developer = Bungie Studios| publisher = Microsoft| year = 2001| platform =[[Xbox]]| version = | level = Two Betrayals}}</ref> The ringworlds were activated once in the distant past, and the Forerunners are believed to have perished.<ref>'''343 Guilty Spark''': After exhausting every other strategic option, my creators activated the rings. They, and all additional sentient life in three radii of the galactic center, died ...as planned. - {{cite video game| title = [[Halo 2]]| developer = Bungie Studios| publisher = Microsoft| year = 2004| platform =Xbox| version = | level = The Great Journey}}</ref> In ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', a small human ship fleeing the Covenant stumbled upon one of these ringworlds, [[Halo (megastructure)#Installation 04|Installation 04]]. The humans manage to destroy the ring, stopping the Flood once again; the Covenant, unaware of the destructive nature of the rings, attempt to fire another ring during ''[[Halo 2]]'' in order to fulfill their religious prophecy.<ref name=wind>'''Mercy''': Halo. Its divine wind will rush through the stars, propelling all who are worthy along the path to salvation. - {{cite video game| title = [[Halo 2]]| developer = Bungie Studios| publisher = Microsoft| year = 2004| platform =[[Xbox]]| version = | level = Sacred Icon}}</ref> One race in the Covenant, the [[Covenant Elite|Elite]]s, learn the truth about the rings, and join forces with their onetime enemies, humanity, in order to stop the firing of the ring. Though they are successful, the unexpected shutdown of the installation triggers a failsafe protocol<U+2014>''all'' the rings are ready to fire from one single location, referred to as the [[Halo (megastructure)#The Ark|Ark]].<ref>'''343 Guilty Spark:''' Fail-safe protocol: in the event of unexpected shut-down, the entire system will move to standby status. All installations are now ready for remote activation. / '''Commander Keyes:''' Remote activation? From here? / '''343 Guilty Spark:''' Don't be ridiculous. [...] Why... the Ark, of course. {{cite video game|title=Halo 2 |developer=Bungie |publisher=Microsoft |platform=Xbox }}</ref> Still oblivious to the true nature of the rings, the Covenant [[High Prophet of Truth]] and the remaining loyalist Covenant proceed to head to Earth, where they believe the Ark is buried.

Johnson|SGM Johnson]] and the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]]. The Chief, Johnson, and company fight their way out of the jungle and arrive at a UNSC outpost. Here, [[List of Halo characters#Miranda Keyes|Commander Keyes]] and [[List of Halo characters#Terrence Hood|Lord Hood]] plan a last-ditch effort to stop the Covenant leader, the [[High Prophet of Truth]], from activating a [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunner]] artifact uncovered outside the ruins of the city of New Mombasa. The Chief is ordered to clear a way into the city of [[Voi]] and to destroy all anti-air Covenant defenses so Hood can lead the last of Earth's ships against the Prophet. Using the opening caused by the ground attack, Hood mounts an offensive against Truth's ship, but the Prophet activates the buried artifact which creates an enormous [[slipspace]] portal. As the human ships recover from the shock wave, Truth and his followers enter the portal, while a ship controlled by the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]] crash-lands nearby. [[Elite (Halo)|Elite]] forces, allied with humanity, arrive and [[vitrification|vitrify]] Flood-infected areas of Earth, neutralizing the parasitic threat. Following the cryptic message from the human artificial intelligence [[Cortana]] left aboard the Flood cruiser, the Chief, Arbiter, Elites, Johnson, Keyes and a handful of Marines follow Truth through the portal. Joining them is the Forerunner construct [[343 Guilty Spark]], who aids the Chief as he no longer has any function to fulfill after the destruction of his Halo installation in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]''.

Traveling through the portal, the humans and Elites discover an immense artificial structure <U+2014>the [[Halo (megastructure)#The Ark|Ark]]<U+2014> which is far beyond the edges of the Milky Way galaxy. Here Truth can activate all the Halos. The Chief and company activate the installation's map room to find Truth at the Ark's control room. During their journey, the Flood arrive en masse on the former Covenant Holy City ''High Charity'', and begin infesting the installation. While attempting to gain access to The Ark' Control Room, Johnson is captured by Truth; the prophet needs a human to utilize the Forerunner technology. Attempting to rescue Johnson, Keyes is killed by the prophet, and Johnson is forced to activate the rings. The Flood leader [[Gravemind]] forges a temporary truce with the Chief and Arbiter in an effort to stop Truth.  The Arbiter, Master Chief, and Flood forces arrive and overwhelm Truth's guards, rescuing Johnson and halting the installations' firing. After the Arbiter kills Truth, Gravemind turns on the Chief and Arbiter, who escape the Flood's grasp. 

The Chief, Arbiter and Guilty Spark discover that the Ark is creating a new ringworld to replace the one previously destroyed. The Chief decides to activate only this ''new'' ring to eliminate the local Flood while sparing the galaxy at large. Before he can activate the ring, however, he needs an Activation Index. Knowing that Cortana acquired a copy of one on the first Halo, he rescues the AI from ''High Charity'' and creates a chain reaction to destroy the infested city and severely damage the Gravemind.

Arriving on the new Halo, Cortana warns that the Gravemind is trying to rebuild itself on the ring. The Chief, the Arbiter, and Johnson make their way to the control room, where they will activate Halo's weapon. Guilty Spark explains that because the ring is not yet complete, a premature activation will destroy it and the Ark. When Johnson ignores his warning, Guilty Spark kills him to protect "his" ring. The Chief destroys Guilty Spark, activates the ring, and escapes the ring's blast on a frigate, ''Forward Unto Dawn.''

Only the front half of ''Forward Unto Dawn'', carrying the Arbiter, makes it through the portal. Believing the Chief and Cortana to have perished, a memorial service is held for the fallen heroes of the human and Covenant war. After the memorial service, the Arbiter departs for his home planet, where the Elites are finally free of the Prophets' hegemony. Meanwhile, the rear half of ''Forward Unto Dawn'' floats in unknown space. Cortana drops a beacon, but realizes it may be years before they are rescued. The Chief enters cryonic sleep, telling Cortana to "wake me, when you need me." If the game is completed at the highest difficulty level, the scene continues to show the piece of ''Forward Unto Dawn'' drifting towards a mysterious planet.

==Development==
Initial conception for ''Halo 3'' was done before the game's predecessor, ''[[Halo 2]]'' was released in 2004.<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Marty O'Donnell|O'Donnell, Marty]] |date2=2007-09-25 |title=Halo 2 Developer's Commentary |medium=[[Halo 3#Versions|''Halo 3'' Legendary Edition]] | time=04:00| publisher=[[Bungie Studios]]}}<U+2014> '''O'Donnell:'''"I remember when we were doing the Cortana Letters years ago where we had the entire plan from the beginning of the Cortana Letters to the end of the trilogy."</ref> For a period after this, much of the staff were still preoccupied in making extra content for ''Halo 2'', while others continued with the groundwork for the development of ''Halo 3''. Bungie remained almost completely silent as to what their new project was for the next year and half, occasionally leaving comments in their weekly update alluding to a "new project."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&link=updatemay05|title=Bungie Weekly Update: 05/05/06|author=O'Connor, Frank|date=2006-05-05|accessdate=2007-10-27|publisher=[[Bungie.net]]}}</ref> Due to the cliff-hanger ending of ''Halo 2'', many observers correctly speculated that Bungie's new project was ''Halo 3''.

The game was officially announced with a [[Real-time computing|real-time]] [[cinematic]] [[trailer]] at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3 2006]].<ref name="announcement" /> Similarly to the development of ''Halo 2'', Bungie kept the public informed on game development via "Bungie Weekly Updates". During development, the game was divided into single player and multiplayer [[Software build|builds]]; this made debugging and testing the much smaller multiplayer files quicker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&cid=8858|title=Bungie Weekly Update: 09/01/06|author=O'Connor, Frank|date=2006-09-01|accessdate=2007-10-27|publisher=[[Bungie.net]]}}</ref> While details of ''Halo 3''{{'}}s multiplayer were widely disseminated in the sixteen months leading up to the release,<ref name="1up prev"/> the single-player aspect of the storyline was kept relatively secret throughout much of the development to build up interest. The first campaign screenshots did not appear until a year after the announcement trailer, on July 5, 2007, as a "tease" for the planned pace of marketing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&cid=12625|title=Bungie Weekly Update: 07/06/07|author=O'Connor, Frank|date=2007-07-06|accessdate=2007-10-27|publisher=[[Bungie.net]]}}</ref>

''Halo 3'' utilizes a proprietary, in-house [[Game engine|graphics engine]], often referred to as the "''Halo 3'' Engine".<ref name="igntrailer">{{cite web |url = http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/706/706251p1.html |title = E3 2k6: Halo 3 Trailer Impressions |accessdate = 2007-06-25 |author =  Sanders, Kathleen |date = [[2006-05-09]] |publisher=IGN E3 2006 Coverage |publisher=[[IGN]]|quote = ...rendered in real-time on the [[Xbox 360]] using the current version of the ''Halo 3'' engine.}}</ref> As detailed on the Bungie Studios website, it employs advanced graphics technologies such as [[High dynamic range rendering|High Dynamic Range]], global lighting and [[depth of field]] effects within cutscenes.<ref>{{cite web|author=Klepek, Patrick|date=2007-03-19|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3158071|title=Bungie Says ''Halo 3'' Graphics are coming Together|publisher=1up.com|accessdate=2007-10-02}}</ref> [[Motion blur]]ring was absent from the beta, but was added to the final game.<ref>{{cite web |author=Booker, Logan|date=2007-11-01|url=http://www.atomicmpc.com.au/article.asp?CIID=97254 |title=Halo 3 - Review - Console Gaming |publisher=atomicmpc.com.au|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> Most of the dynamic objects in the game cast real-time shadows on themselves and the environment around them, including the game's plant life.

After the game was released, speculations arose that ''Halo 3'' did not natively render at true [[High-definition video|HD]] resolution (at least 720 lines of vertical resolution).<ref>{{cite web|author=Dobson, Jacob|date=2007-09-28|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/09/28/halo-3-not-hd-runs-at-640p-pixel-counters-claim/|title=''Halo 3'' not HD: Runs at 640p, Pixel Counters Claim|publisher=[[Joystiq]]|accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref> In a Bungie Weekly Update, it was confirmed that the game was rendered at 1152<U+00D7>640 resolution instead of the usual 1280<U+00D7>720 (HD) resolution that most [[Xbox 360]] games use.<ref name=640p/> The choice for this design was conscious on Bungie's part, due to the fact that ''Halo 3'' uses two frame buffers instead of the usual one, and that this choice would allow Bungie to preserve as much of the dynamic range as possible for the game's lighting, as well as maintaining a smooth frame rate. The picture could be upscaled all the way up to [[1080p]] by the Xbox 360.<ref name=640p>{{cite web|author=Smith, Luke|date=2007-09-28|url=http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&cid=12821|title=You owe me 80p!|publisher=[[Bungie.net]]|accessdate=2007-10-01}}</ref>

{{Halo 3 Versions}}
''Halo 3'' was released in three separate versions. The Standard Edition contains the game disc, manual, and a small poster with the game's control-map and artwork. 

The Limited Edition, contained in a metal case, contains the game disc, manual, poster, interactive Xbox 360 bonus disc with several featurettes, and a hard cover bound "Bestiarum", which is a collection of information and art covering the species, cultures, and civilizations of ''Halo 3''. 

The final version was marketed as the "Legendary Edition", which contains the game disc, manual, poster, interactive bonus disc, Bestiarum (on one of the DVD discs), Legendary DVD containing special content exclusive to the Legendary Edition, and a scale replica of the Master Chief's helmet as a case for the three discs.
