The '''Three Kids Mine Remediation and Reclamation Act''' ({{USBill|113|H.R.|697}}) is a bill that would authorize the sale of approximately 950 acres of federal land to the city of [[Henderson, Nevada]].<ref name="697sum"/>  The land used to be a mine and now needs significant environmental remediation and reclamation.<ref name="cbo697"/>  The bill was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]]; a previous version ({{USBill|113|H.R.|2512}}) passed the House during the [[112th United States Congress]], but never received a vote in the Senate.<ref name=gop697>{{cite web|title=Legislative Digest - H.R. 697|url=http://www.gop.gov/bill/113/1/hr697|publisher=House Republicans|accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref>  Cleanup efforts of the land are expected to cost between $300 million and $1.2 billion, depending on various estimates and cleanup targets.<ref name="gop697"/>

==Provisions/Elements of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[Public domain|public domain]] source.''<ref name=697sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 697 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/697|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref> 

The Three Kids Mine Remediation and Reclamation Act would direct the [[United States Department of the Interior]] to convey to the Henderson Redevelopment Agency of the city of [[Henderson, Nevada]], the [[Three Kids Mine]] [[Federal lands|Federal Land]] (the parcel or parcels of federal land consisting of approximately 948 specified acres) for the [[environmental remediation]] and reclamation of the Three Kids Mine Project Site.<ref name="697sum"/>  The bill also would direct the Secretary of the Interior to administratively adjust the [[fair market value]] of the Three Kids Mine Federal Land based on the reasonable approximate assessment, remediation, and reclamation costs for the Three Kids Mine Project Area.<ref name="697sum"/> The bill would then require the Henderson Redevelopment Agency to pay the fair market value, if any for the Three Kids Mine Federal Land.

The bill would adjust the boundary of the River Mountains Area of Critical Environmental Concern.  It also releases the United States, upon making the conveyance, from any and all liabilities or claims of any kind or nature arising from the presence, release, or threat of release of any hazardous substance or mining related materials at the Three Kids Mine Project Site.<ref name="697sum"/>

Finally, it would make the provisions of the [[Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1998]] ({{USPL|105|273}}) inapplicable to land conveyed under this Act.<ref name="697sum"/>

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], a [[Public domain|public domain]] source.''<ref name=cbo697>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 697|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44357|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref> 

H.R. 697 would require the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) to sell 950 acres of federal land, some of which are contaminated by [[hazardous waste]], to the city of Henderson, Nevada.<ref name="cbo697"/> Under the bill, the agency would determine the sale price by estimating the fair market value of the land and reducing that amount by the estimated cost of any necessary environmental remediation and [[Mine reclamation|mining reclamation]] activities at the site.<ref name="cbo697"/> The city of Henderson would be responsible for those costs following the sale. Based on information from the BLM, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the legislation would have no significant impact on the federal budget. Enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.<ref name="cbo697"/>

Roughly 15 percent of the lands that would be sold under the bill are contaminated and will require mine reclamation and environmental remediation.<ref name="cbo697"/> Based on information provided by the BLM and the city of Henderson, the CBO estimates that the agency is unlikely to receive any financial compensation for any of the land because remediation and reclamation costs would exceed the land<U+2019>s fair market value.<ref name="cbo697"/> Because the CBO expects that the affected lands would not generate any receipts under current law over the next 10 years, we estimate that conveying the lands under the bill would have no significant impact on the federal budget.<ref name="cbo697"/>

==Procedural history==
The Three Kids Mine Remediation and Reclamation Act was introduced into the House by [[Joe Heck|Rep. Joe Heck (R-NV)]] on February 14, 2013.<ref name=697allCongActions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 697 - All Congressional Actions|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:H.R.697:@@@X|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref>  The bill was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources]] and two of its subcommittees: the [[United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources]] and the [[United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation]].<ref name="697allCongActions"/> On July 8, 2013, it was reported (amended) by the Committee on Natural Resources alongside [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-113hrpt137/pdf/CRPT-113hrpt137.pdf House Report 113-137].<ref name="697allCongActions"/>  On Friday, July 19, 2013, House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] announced that H.R. 697 would be on the schedule for consideration under a suspension of the rules on July 22, 2013.<ref name=mlscheduleJuly22>{{cite web|title=Majority Leader's Schedule - July 22, 2013|url=http://majorityleader.gov/floor/7-22-13.pdf|publisher=House Majority Leader's Office|accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref><ref name=peteMonday>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=Monday: Expanding intelligence activities at DHS|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/312473-monday-expanding-intelligence-activities-at-dhs|accessdate=22 July 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=July 22, 2013}}</ref>  

==Debate and discussion==
The City of Henderson, NV paid a lobbyist organization $10,000 in 2013, part of which went to fund lobbying activities in favor of the Three Kids Mine Remediation and Reclamation Act.<ref name=opensecrets697>{{cite web|title=Lobbying - City of Henderson, NV - Bills lobbied|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientbills.php?id=D000048918&year=2013|publisher=Center for Responsive Politics|accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref> 

In 2013, the [[Las Vegas Sun]] listed off the Three Kids Mine Remediation and Reclamation Act as item number three in its list of "Top 10 Nevada land swaps stalled in Congress," noting that 87 percent of Nevada's land is federally owned.<ref name=lvsTop10>{{cite news|last=Demirjian|first=Karoun|title=Top 10 Nevada land swaps stalled in Congress|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/feb/28/top-10-nevada-land-swaps-stalled-congress/|accessdate=22 July 2013|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|date=February 28, 2013}}</ref>
