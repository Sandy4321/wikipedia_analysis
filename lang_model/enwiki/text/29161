They wrestled for the [[United States|American]] [[promotion (wrestling)|promotion]], [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment]] (WWF/E) between October 1998 and March 2004. 

Before forming the APA, Faarooq and Bradshaw were known as the Hell's Henchmen and were later a part of [[The Undertaker]]'s [[Ministry of Darkness]] as The Acolytes.<ref name=APA2>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/a/apa.html|accessdate=2007-12-04|title=APA Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> As The Acolytes they won two [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championships]] in 1999 while feuding with [[Kane]] and the [[Hardy Boyz]]. After renaming themselves the Acolytes Protection Agency in 2001, they functioned as bodyguards to other wrestlers, and won a third tag team championship in 2001.<ref name="3WTT">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321143|accessdate=2008-03-24|title=The APA's third World Tag Title reign|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment}}</ref>  In 2002, the duo was split during the [[WWE Brand Extension|brand extension]], where Simmons went to [[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown!]], as Bradshaw went to [[WWE Raw|Raw]].

===Hell's Henchmen (1998)===
As single competitors in [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]], Layfield (under the name of Bradshaw) and Simmons (under the name Faarooq) were going nowhere with their careers.
