'''''Sweet Kisses''''' is the debut [[studio album]] by [[United States|American]] [[pop music|pop]] [[singer]] [[Jessica Simpson]]. The album was released on November 23, 1999 in the [[United States]] by [[Columbia Records]].  The album contained two hit singles: "[[I Wanna Love You Forever]]" and the "[[Jack and Diane]]" sampled dance track "[[I Think I'm in Love With You]]".  Also included were two duets: "[[Where You Are (Jessica Simpson song)|Where You Are]]" with future ex-husband [[Nick Lachey]] of [[98 Degrees]] and "Woman in Me," featuring [[Destiny's Child]].

The album has sold 2 million copies in the United States and 4 million worldwide.

==Critical reception==
The album received mostly mixed reviews. ''[[Allmusic]]'' gave the album three out of five stars, quoting "she delves into the frothy [[dance-pop]] that's [[teen pop]]'s stock-in-trade, but the heart of her album lies in adult contemporary ballads like her breakout hit "I Wanna Love You Forever," which gives her a chance to show off the richness of her voice. She doesn't over-sing, like [[Christina Aguilera|Aguilera]] occasionally does, even if she has moments where she pushes the envelope slightly <U+2014> just like her idol [[Celine Dion|Dion]]. However, there are already indications that she's developing her own voice, since she is equally capable of delivering danceable urban [[R&B]] ("Final Heartbreak," "I've Got My Eyes on You," the [[Destiny's Child]] duet"Woman in Me") as she is mature balladry ("Faith in Me," the [[Nick Lachey]] duet "Where You Are"). Like most teen-pop albums, ''Sweet Kisses'' suffers from inconsistent material, yet the filler is well-produced and performed, making the record every bit as listenable as Aguilera's fine debut."

==Chart performance==
Initially, the album debuted at number 65 on the [[Billboard 200]], significantly lower than expected by [[Columbia Records]], as the first single from the album was a hit, peaking at #3 on the [[Hot 100]]. The following week the album under the number 70, and continuing down the following weeks. To make the album more successful, the label released the second single "[[Where You Are (Jessica Simpson song)|Where You Are]]", but could not reach the success of its predecessor "[[I Wanna Love You Forever]]". While ''Sweet Kisses'' was kept in the top 60 for several weeks, the label decided to make one last attempt to launch the third single from the album. "[[I Think I'm in Love With You]]" was released in May 2000, instantly became a hit on radio stations that helped to rise from posts and album reached the peak 25 in August 2000.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/#/album/jessica-simpson/sweet-kisses/390244]</ref> Stayed on the chart for 62 weeks.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/#/album/jessica-simpson/sweet-kisses/390244]</ref> The album was certified 2<U+00D7> Platinum by the [[RIAA]].<ref>[http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=sweet%20kisses&artist=jessica%20simpson&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2009&sort=Artist&perPage=25]</ref> The album has sold about 1.9 million copies in the US.

In [[Canada]] reached the #34 in the chart and was certified Platinum by the [[CRIA]]. In Europe the album  had a better performance on the charts, which peaked the number 4 in [[Norway]] which was certified Gold for sales 15,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ifpi.no/sok/index_trofe.htm | title=Norwegian Certification | author=International Federation of the Phonographic Industry&nbsp;<U+2014> Norway | year=2000 | accessdate=July 17, 2010}}</ref> and number 5 in [[Switzerland]].

==Singles==
"[[I Wanna Love You Forever]]" was the first single of the album, and was released in September 1999. The song became Simpson biggest charting single in the [[United States]] which it peaked at number-three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Its commercial sales were particularly strong, and landed the single atop the [[Hot 100 Singles Sales]] for six weeks; this in turn earned the song a platinum certification. In the Worldwide the single was successful, as it peaked within the top ten in most European nations and Australia, which reached the Top 10 in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[UK]], [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]].

"[[Where You Are (Jessica Simpson song)|Where You Are]]" was released as the second single from the album. The single failed to reach even the top fifty of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at sixty-two. The song did, however, become a relative Adult Contemporary hit. Strangely enough though, dance fans reacted strongly to the physical single of the song and the song became a hit on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales reaching number four. Internationally, the song was not released in major music markets excluding Canada.

"[[I Think I'm In Love With You]]" was the third and final single released from her debut album. It was more up tempo than Simpson's previous singles and became a moderate hit, reaching number twenty-one on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100]], largely on the strength of its radio airplay; it reached the top five on Billboard's [[Top 40 Mainstream]] and  chart and achieved success on the Adult Contemporary and Rhythmic Top 40 charts. In the Worldwide, reached at number 4 in [[Philippines]]. In [[Australia]] peaked number 10, and the Top 20 in [[Canada]], [[UK]] , [[New Zealand]] and [[Austria]].
