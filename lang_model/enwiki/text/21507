The '''Wells Fargo Building''', originally the '''Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company Building''', is a skyscraper located in [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States. Designed in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts style]] by architectural firm Simon and Simon, the building was erected for the Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Co. in 1928. The 29-[[Storey|story]] high-rise is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. 

Soon after its opening, the building became premier office space in the city, but by the 1980s, tenants were vacating the building for newer facilities being built in the [[Market Street (Philadelphia)|West Market Street]] neighborhood. The building has since been populated with new tenants after restoration and modernization efforts. Through many mergers, the bank that started as the Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company and is now [[Wells Fargo]] has remained the building's largest tenant throughout its entire history. 

The {{convert|405|ft|m}} tall limestone and granite skyscraper features recesses that give the building an H-shape. Decorations include sculpture by [[Piccirilli Brothers]] and {{convert|150000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} of [[marble]]. Seven medallions, mainly depicting early American coins, decorate the street-level facade. [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|Bas-relief]] figures decorate the [[spandrel]]s above the building's bronze doors, which are themselves decorated by high-relief panels depicting the history of commerce and civilization.

==History==
In the late 1920s, numerous high-rises were constructed in Center City Philadelphia.<ref>{{cite book | author =Weigley, Russell F., et al. (eds) |authorlink=Russell Weigley |title=Philadelphia: A 300-Year History |year=1982 |publisher=W.W. Norton & Company |isbn=0-393-01610-2 |pages=602 }}</ref> Among the businesses commissioning new high-rises was the Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company. The company was the result of a merger between Fidelity Trust Company and the Philadelphia Trust Company in 1926. Before the merger, in 1925, architects Edward P. Simon and Grant M. Simon of the firm Simon and Simon were approached to design a new building. The designs were complete by the end of 1926 and in January 1927 general contractor Irwin & Leighton was engaged to build the Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company Building.<ref name="NRHP">{{cite web |last=Webster |first=Richard J. | title=National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form: Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company Building | publisher=United States Department of the Interior | date=February 22, 1978 | url=https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H001367_01H.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2010-04-16 }}</ref><ref name="PBJ1">{{cite journal | quotes=no | last=Kostelni | first=Natalie | date=June 23, 2000 | title=For Sale: Tons of Center City space | journal=Philadelphia Business Journal }}</ref> The site of the building along [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad Street]] was previously the location of the Forrest Theater and the "Yellow Mansion" (also known as the Dundas Lippincott House).<ref name="inky2">{{cite journal | last=Stock | first=Craig | date=December 10, 1982 | title=Arab Set to Buy 2 Philadelphia Landmarks | journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer | page=A01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Lippincott |first=Horace Mather |title=Early Philadelphia: Its People, Life and Progress |year=1917 |publisher=J.

Construction began in 1927 and the building was opened on June 1, 1928.<ref name="NRHP" /> The building became premier office space in the center of the city, serving as the home of major law firms among other tenants.<ref name="inky1">{{cite journal | quotes=no | date=June 18, 1992 | title=Fidelity Building's Owners File for Ch. 11 Bankruptcy Protection | journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer | page=C10 }}</ref> In 1953, steel and concrete pen houses were built at the back of the building to house [[air conditioning]] equipment.<ref name="NRHP" />

In July 1982, the parent company of Fidelity Bank, Fidelcor Inc., put Fidelity Building Corp., a subsidiary which owns The Fidelity Building and the neighboring Witherspoon Building, up for sale. In December of that year, Fidelcor Inc. announced that the Al-Tajir Foundation, a real estate investment company owned by [[Mahdi Al Tajir]], had agreed to buy Fidelity Building Corp. for US$63.5 million.<ref name="inky2" /> In 1983, the building was featured in the [[Eddie Murphy]] film ''[[Trading Places]]''.<ref name="PBJ1" />

The late 1980s saw an office building boom in the [[Market Street (Philadelphia)|West Market Street]] area of Center City. Businesses vacated the Fidelity Building in order to move to newly built office space. As a result, the building's owners filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]] in 1992.<ref name="inky1" /><ref name="inky3">{{cite journal | date=October 22, 1990 | title=Grand Old Dames Bow to Center City's Skyscrapers | journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer | page=D01 }}</ref> In the same year the Fidelity Building Corporation was purchased by First Fidelity Bankcorp, a company formed from the merger of the building's original owners and First Fidelity Corporation of [[Newark, New Jersey]] in 1988.<ref>{{cite journal | date=April 19, 1995 | title=Phila.

Broad owner shift | journal=Philadelphia Business Journal }}</ref>

During the early 2000s, the building became known as the Wachovia Building. [[Wachovia]] became the building's largest tenant after merging with First Union Corporation early in the decade. In 2006, Wachovia re-negotiated its lease, which was set to expire in 2010. After exploring other potential new office space in Center City, Wachovia made a deal to stay in the Wachovia Building along with the neighboring Witherspoon Building, the nearby [[One South Broad]], and the Widener Building until the 2020s.<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | last=Holcomb | first=Henry J. | date=May 12, 2006 | title=Wachovia decides to stay on South Broad Street | journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer }}</ref> The building became known as the Wells Fargo Building after [[Wells Fargo]], which bought Wachovia in 2008, re-branded Wachovia area banks in April 2011. Wells Fargo marketed the change by having a stagecoach carrying Philadelphia mayor [[Michael Nutter]] and others ride from [[Philadelphia City Hall]] to the Wells Fargo Building.<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | last=Brubaker | first=Harold | date=April 13, 2011 | title=Pa.

==Architecture==
The 29-[[Storey|story]], {{convert|405|ft|m}} tall Wells Fargo Building is located on the [[Avenue of the Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Avenue of the Arts]] in Center City, Philadelphia. The building faces Broad Street on the west, [[Walnut Street (Philadelphia)|Walnut Street]] on the south, and Sansom Street on the north.<ref name="NRHP" /><ref name="PBJ1" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=wachoviabuilding-philadelphia-pa-usa|title=Wachovia Building|accessdate=2010-04-27|publisher=Emporis.com}}</ref> To the east of the building is the 11-story Witherspoon Building, built in 1896. Owned by the same owners, the two buildings are linked together.<ref name="PBJ1" /><ref name="inky2" /><ref name="PBJ2" /> Containing {{convert|892000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}}, the Wells Fargo Building's footprint measures {{convert|220|ft|6.5|in|2}} by {{convert|175|ft|5.5|in|2}}. Built in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts style]] the building's brick [[curtain wall]] is made of [[limestone]] [[ashlar]] on the upper and lower floors and [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] [[granite]] on the 2nd and 3rd floors.<ref name="NRHP" />

[[Image:Wellsfargobldg2011.jpg|thumb|left|The Wells Fargo Building during the Philadelphia International Festival of the Arts in 2011.]]
Horizontally the building is divided into three parts. The first two stories and a mezzanine level make up the building's base. The next eighteen floors make up the building's shaft and center. The distinctive features of the center are two {{convert|55|ft|m}} recesses on the east and west sides of the building. Starting above the fourth floor, the recesses give the building an H-shape. The skyscraper's top section is distinguished from the lower floors by three small [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]].<ref name="NRHP" /><ref name="PBJ1" />

At street level, three arched entranceways line Broad Street. The central arch is slightly larger than the others to indicate the entrance to the main banking hall. Carved into the facade above the center arch is the building's name. Inside the arches and above the doorways are windows designed by d'Ascenzo Studios. Leaded panes of glass of various shades of amber are surrounded by a Renaissance-style border. Below the windows are bronze doors, each with 24 high-relief panels depicting the history of commerce and civilization. [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|Bas-relief]] figures decorate each of the arches' [[spandrel]]s. A male figure with a hammer representing industry and a female figure with a beehive representing thrift decorate the center arch. The arch closest to Sansom Street is decorated by two figures with [[cornucopia]]s to represent abundance. The arch nearer to Walnut Street is decorated by a painter and a sculptor to represent art.<ref name="NRHP" />

Next to the two smaller archways are carved medallions, one flanking each spandrel. The medallions closest to Sansom Street represent early American coins, a Pine Tree coin from [[Massachusetts]] and Grandi Copper coin from [[Connecticut]]. The medallions closest to the Walnut Street side represent the first American coin issued by Congress and the Eye Coin from [[Vermont]]. Two medallions on the Walnut Street side depict both sides of the Lafayette Medal. Only one medallion decorates the Samson Street side, depicting another early coin from Vermont.<ref name="NRHP" />

The Wells Fargo Building's interiors include a 2<U+00BD>-story banking hall featuring six 58-ton steel girders that support the skyscraper's structure. The girders were the largest in the Eastern United States at the time of construction. Among the {{convert|150000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} of [[marble]] inside the Wells Fargo Building is the cream-colored [[terrazzo]] marble used throughout the banking hall. At the rear of the hall is a marble sculpture by the [[Piccirilli Brothers]]. The statue depicts semi-nude male and female representations of day and night clasping hands under a clock to symbolize eternity.<ref name="NRHP" /><ref name="prnewswire">{{cite journal | quotes=no | date=January 10, 1995 | title=First Fidelity to Lease Over {{convert|100000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} in First Fidelity Building to Montgomery, McCracken, Walker & Rhoads | journal=PR Newswire |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/FIRST+FIDELITY+TO+LEASE+OVER+100,000+SQUARE+FEET+IN+FIRST+FIDELITY...-a016017459 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref>

Above the statue and framed by marble [[pilaster]]s is a window that depicts scenes from [[History of Philadelphia|Philadelphia history]]. In the window's [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] is a depiction of [[Independence Hall]]. Below that are pictures<!--painting? relief?--> showing [[William Penn]]'s treaty with the Indians, [[George Washington's Farewell Address]] to [[United States Congress|Congress]], the proclamation of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the [[Philadelphia Convention]], the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s printing office, [[Betsy Ross]] exhibiting the United States flag, and [[Caesar Rodney]]'s ride from Delaware. The border of the window contains portrait busts of notable [[American Revolution]]-era Philadelphians: [[John Bartram]], [[George Clymer]], [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]], [[David Rittenhouse]], [[Benjamin Rush]], and [[James Wilson]].<ref name="NRHP" />

The Wells Fargo Building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on November 27, 1978.<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|2010-04-27}}</ref> The skyscraper was listed because it was an excellent example of commercial Beaux-Arts architecture and because it stands "as a glossary of modern skyscraper design, synthesizing the primary features of three phases of skyscraper development reaching back to the 1880s". The building's characteristics are its tripartite system of a base, shaft, and capital, the treatment of the skyscraper as a tower, and the use of setbacks.<ref name="NRHP" />

==Tenants==
Leasing 30 percent of the building, Wells Fargo is the skyscraper's largest tenant.<ref name="PBJ2" /> The second largest tenant is law firm Montgomery, McCracken, Walker & Rhoads, which occupies about {{convert|108000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} on the top five and a half floors; the firm signed a 15-year lease in 1995.<ref name="prnewswire" /> Other tenants include Domus Inc., which occupies {{convert|12000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}}.<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | last=Kostelni | first=Natalie | date=March 29, 2002 | title=Partridge Tackett Architects splitting up | journal=Philadelphia Business Journal |url=http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2002/04/01/newscolumn4.html | accessdate=2010-04-15}}</ref> Domus Inc. moved into the Wells Fargo Building in 2000 after outgrowing its space in [[the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel]].<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | last=Bennett | first=Elizabeth | date=January 12, 2001 | title=Partridge Tackett Architects splitting up | journal=Philadelphia Business Journal |url=http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2002/04/01/newscolumn4.html | accessdate=2010-04-15}}</ref>

Past tenants include the law firms [[Morgan Lewis & Bockius]] and [[Pepper Hamilton|Pepper Hamilton & Sheetz]] and offices for the Westmoreland Coal Company.<ref name="inky3" /> A private eating club used to operate at the top of the building. Called the Midday Club, it was intended "to provide in the heart of the financial district, removed from the noise and activity of the street, a place where businessmen can dine in a restful atmosphere with their business associates".<ref name=Midday>{{cite news | date=March 15, 1993 | title=A City Club That's Above it All | journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer | page=E01 }}</ref> The Midday Club opened in 1929 and closed in 1978.<ref name=Midday />
