'''Thomas Sprat''' ([[1635]] &ndash; [[May 20]], [[1713]]), [[England|English]] divine, was born at [[Beaminster]], [[Dorset]], and educated at [[Wadham College, Oxford]], where he held a fellowship from 1657 to 1670.

Having taken [[holy orders|orders]] he became a [[prebendary]] of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] in [[1660]]. In the preceding year he had gained a reputation by his poem ''To the Happie Memory of the most Renowned Prince Oliver, Lord Protector'' (London, 1659), and he was afterwards well known as a wit, preacher and man of letters.

His chief prose works are the ''Observations upon Monsieur de Sorbier's Voyage into England'' (London, 1665), a satirical reply to the strictures on Englishmen in [[Samuel de Sorbi<U+00E8>re]]'s book of that name, and a ''History of the Royal Society of London'' (London, 1667), which Sprat had helped to found. The ''History of the Royal Society'' elaborates the scientific purposes of the academy and outlines some of the strictures of scientific writing that set the modern standards for clarity and conciseness.

In [[1669]] he became [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Westminster Abbey]], and in 1670 [[rector]] of [[Uffington, Lincolnshire]]. He was chaplain to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in [[1676]], [[curate]] and lecturer at [[St. Margaret's, Westminster]], in 1679, canon of [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] in 1681, dean of Westminster in 1683 and [[Bishop of Rochester]] in 1684.

He was a member of [[James II of England|James II]]'s ecclesiastical commission, and in [[1688]] he read the ''Declaration of Indulgence'' to empty benches in Westminster Abbey. The suggestion was that he was playing at being [[Vicar of Bray]]. Although he opposed the motion of 1689 declaring the throne vacant, he assisted at the coronation of [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]]. As dean of Westminster he directed [[Christopher Wren]]'s restoration of the abbey.
