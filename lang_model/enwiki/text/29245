'''Dundee''' ({{lang-gd|D<U+00F9>n D<U+00E8>agh}})is the fourth-largest [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] in [[Scotland]]. It is on the north bank of the [[River Tay|River Tay's]] [[estuary]] which feeds into the [[North Sea]].

Dundee's history begins with the [[Picts]] in the [[Iron Age]]. During the [[Medieval Era]], it was the site of many battles. Throughout the [[Industrial Revolution]], the local [[jute]] industry caused the city to grow rapidly. In this period, Dundee also gained a reputation for its marmalade industry and its journalism, giving Dundee its epithet as the city of "jute, jam and journalism".

Presently, Dundee's population is 143,090. However, if [[contiguous]] settlements&mdash;such as [[Monifieth]], [[Birkhill]], and [[Invergowrie]]&mdash;are counted, the number is around 170,000. Dundee's population reached a peak of nearly 200,000 at the start of the 1970s, but has since declined, due to outward migration and the change of council boundaries in the 1970s and 1980s, which saw Dundee lose suburbs to the surrounding counties. 

Today, Dundee is known as the ''City of Discovery'', in honour of Dundee's history of scientific activities and of the [[RRS Discovery|RRS ''Discovery'']], [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] exploration vessel, which was built in Dundee and is now berthed in the city harbour. Biomedical and technological industries have arrived since the 1980s, and the city now accounts for 10% of the [[United Kingdom]]'s digital-entertainment industry. Dundee has two universities&mdash;the [[University of Dundee]] and the [[University of Abertay Dundee]]. The city is home to the [[Scottish Dance Theatre]], which is based in the city's renowned[[Dundee Repertory Theatre]]. The [[Royal Scottish National Orchestra]] regularly plays in the city's Caird Hall. On [[5 March]], [[2004]] Dundee was granted [[Fairtrade Town|Fairtrade City]] status.<ref>{{cite press release

==History==
{{main|History of Dundee}}
The date of the earliest settlement on the present site of Dundee is unknown, but certainly long before its first mention in historical records in the 12th century. The name "Dundee", [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] ''D<U+00F9>n D<U+00E8>agh'', incorporates the place-name element ''d<U+00F9>n'', fort, possibly referring to the hill-fort, traces of which survive on Dundee Law. The meaning of Dundee is unknown, though it has been suggested it could mean 'Fort of Fire', perhaps referring to beacons lit on the Law, 'Fort of the God', or 'Fort on the Tay'. In 1191, the town was awarded a [[charter]] making it a [[royal burgh]], which would indicate that it was already a town of some size and importance.<ref name="Gazetteer">{{cite book

}}</ref> This charter was later revoked by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], though it was replaced by a new charter from [[Robert the Bruce]] in 1327. Dundee became a walled city in 1545, owing to a period of hostilities known as the [[rough wooing]]. In July 1547, much of the city was destroyed by an English naval bombardment. In 1645, during the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], Dundee was again besieged, this time by the Royalist [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Marquess of Montrose]].<ref name="Gazetteer" /> In 1651 during the [[Third English Civil War]], it was invaded by [[General Monck]], who was the commander of [[Oliver Cromwell|Oliver Cromwell's]] forces in Scotland. These [[Parliament of England|English Parliamentarians]] destroyed much of the city and killed many of its inhabitants. Dundee was later the site of an early [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] uprising when [[John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee]] raised the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] standard on [[Law, Dundee|Dundee Law]] in support of [[James VII]] ([[James II]] of Great Britain) following his overthrow, earning him the nickname [[Bonnie Dundee]].<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> By the end of the 19th century, a majority of the city's workers were employed in its many jute mills and in related industries. Dundee's location on a major estuary allowed for the easy importation of jute from the [[Indian subcontinent]] as well as [[whale oil]]&mdash;needed for the processing of the jute&mdash;from the city's large [[whaling]] industry. The industry began to decline in the 20th century as it became cheaper to process the cloth on the Indian subcontinent. The city's last jute mill closed in the 1970s. 
[[Image:Tayrailbridge.jpg|thumb|250px|The original Tay Bridge (from the south) the day after the disaster. The collapsed section can be seen near the northern end]]
In addition to jute the city is also known for [[jam]] and [[journalism]]. The "jam" association refers to [[marmalade]], which was purportedly invented in the city by [[Janet Keiller]] in 1797 (although in reality, recipes for marmalade have been found dating back to the 1500s). [[Keiller's marmalade]] became a famous brand because of its mass production and its worldwide export. However, the industry was never a major employer compared with the jute trade.<ref name="jam">{{cite web

Dundee also developed a major maritime and shipbuilding industry in the 19th century. 2,000 ships were built in Dundee between 1871 and 1881, including the Antarctic research ship used by [[Robert Falcon Scott]], the ''[[RRS Discovery]]''. This ship is now on display at Discovery Point in the city, and the Victorian steel-framed works in which Discovery's engine was built is now home to the city's largest bookstore.<ref>{{cite book

For elections to the [[European Parliament]], Dundee is within the [[Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|Scotland constituency]].

===Local government=== 

Dundee is one of 32 [[council areas of Scotland]],<ref name="localgovact" /> represented by the Dundee City Council, a local authority composed of 29 elected [[councillor]]s. Previously the city was a [[Counties of Scotland|county of a city]] and later a [[Regions and districts of Scotland|district]] of the [[Tayside]] [[Regions and districts of Scotland|region]]. Council meetings take place in the City Chambers, which opened in 1933 and are located in City Square. The civic head and chair of the council is known as the [[Lord Provost]], a position similar to that of mayor in other cities. The council executive is based in Tayside House on the banks of the [[River Tay]], but the council recently announced plans to demolish it in favour of new premises (Dundee House) on North Lindsay Street.<ref>[http://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/output/2006/03/15/story8126277t0.shtm ''Long live Dundee House''], [[The Evening Telegraph|Evening Telegraph]] (publisher [[DC Thomson]]), [[15 March]] [[2006]]</ref> 
[[Image:City Square, Dundee, Scotland.jpg|thumb|275px|Dundee City Square. The building at the back of the square is Caird Hall. The building on the right is Dundee City Chambers, where the city council meets]]
The council was controlled by a minority coalition of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Liberal Democrats]] of 12 councillors, with the support of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] who had five. Although the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) was the largest party on the council, with 11 councillors.<ref name="political map">[http://www.dundeecity.gov.uk/elections/mappage.htm ''Dundee City Council Political Make-up''], Dundee City Council website</ref><ref>[http://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/output/2005/02/28/story6861222t0.shtm ''Dundee Tory leader hits out at critic''], [[The Evening Telegraph|Evening Telegraph]] (publisher [[DC Thomson]]), [[28 February]] [[2005]]</ref> Elections to the council are on a four year cycle, the most recent [[as of 2007]] being on [[3 May]], [[2007]]. Previously, Councillors were elected from single-member [[Wards of the United Kingdom|ward]]s by the [[first past the post]] system of election, although this changed in the 2007 election, due to the [[Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004]].<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2004/20040009.htm ''Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004'', full text, Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) website]</ref> Eight new multi-member wards were introduced, each electing three or four councillors by [[single transferable vote]], to produce a form of [[proportional representation]]. The 2007 election resulting in no single party having overall control, with 13 [[Scottish National Party]], 10 [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]], 3 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], 2 [[Liberal Democrats]], and 1 Independent Councillors.

===Westminster and Holyrood===

For elections to the [[British House of Commons]] at [[Westminster Palace|Westminster]], the city area and portions of the [[Angus]] council area are divided in two [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]].<ref name="borders">[http://www.bcomm-scotland.gov.uk/ ''Fifth Periodical Review of Constituencies''], [[Boundary Commission for Scotland]]</ref> The constituencies of [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] and  [[Dundee West (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee West]] are [[as of 2007]] represented by [[Stewart Hosie]] ([[Scottish National Party]] (SNP)) and [[James McGovern (politician)|James McGovern]] ([[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]), respectively. For elections to the [[Scottish Parliament]] at [[Scottish Parliament Building|Holyrood]], the city area is divided between three constituencies. The [[Dundee East (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Dundee East (Holyrood) constituency]] and the [[Dundee West (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Dundee West (Holyrood) constituency]] are entirely within the city area. The [[Angus (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Angus (Holyrood) constituency]] includes north-eastern and north-western portions of the city area.<ref name="borders" /> All three constituencies are within the [[North East Scotland (Scottish Parliament region)|North East Scotland electoral region]]. [[as of 2007]] [[Shona Robison]] (SNP) is the [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) for the Dundee East constituency; [[Joe Fitzpatrick]] (SNP) is the current MSP for the Dundee West constituency and [[Andrew Welsh]] (SNP) is the current MSP for the Angus constituency.

}}</ref> Temperatures tend to be a couple of degrees higher than Aberdeen to the north or the coastal areas of Angus. Dundee suffers less severe winters than other parts of Scotland due to the range of protective hills at the back of the city, which are often snow covered while the city itself remains clear.

The city, being on a relatively small landspace, is the most densely populated area in [[Scotland]] after [[Glasgow]] and around fifth in the [[U.K.]] overall. It is characterised by tall tenements, mainly four storeys high, [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]], and built from a honey or brown sandstone. The inner districts of the city, as well as some of the outer estates, are home to a large number of multi storey tower blocks from the 1960s. The outer estates are among some of the poorest urban districts in the [[United Kingdom]]. To the east of the city area is the distinct but incorporated suburb of [[Broughty Ferry]] with its yacht club, wide ranging and upmarket services and expensive houses&mdash;many of architectural note, developed during the [[Industrial Revolution]], housing professionals, footballers, and the [[GMTV]] presenter [[Lorraine Kelly]]. A recent apartment in Broughty Ferry entered the market with an asking price of [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]750,000, far higher than the Scottish average.

Dundee lies close to [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] (20&nbsp;miles) and the southern [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] to the west. [[St Andrews]] (14&nbsp;miles) and north-east [[Fife]] are situated to the south, while the [[Sidlaw Hills]], [[Angus Glens]] and the [[Glamis Castle]] are located to the north. Two of Scotland's most prestigious [[Links (golf)|links]] [[golf]] courses, [[St Andrews Links|St Andrews]] and [[Carnoustie Golf Links|Carnoustie]] are located nearby. The towns of [[Invergowrie]] in [[Perthshire]], [[Newport on Tay]] in [[Fife]] and [[Monifieth]] and [[Birkhill]] in [[Angus]] are outside of local government control of Dundee but are ''[[de facto]]'' suburbs of the city.

Dundee's population increased substantially with the urbanisation of the Industrial Revolution as did other British cities.

===Modern Economic History===
The period following [[World War II]] was notable for the transformation of the city's economy. While jute still employed one-fifth of the working population, new industries were attracted and encouraged. [[NCR Corporation]] selected Dundee as the base of operations for the UK in late 1945,<ref name="ncr">{{cite book

Production started in the year before the official opening of the plant on [[June 11]], [[1947]]. A fortnight after the 10th anniversary of the plant, the 250,000<sup>th</sup> cash machine was produced. By the 1960s, NCR had become the principal employer of the city and produced [[Automatic Teller Machine|ATMs]] at several of its Dundee plants.

Employment in Dundee changed dramatically during the 1980s with the loss of nearly 10,000 manufacturing jobs due to closure of the shipyards, cessation of carpet manufacturing and the disappearance of the jute trade. To combat growing unemployment and declining economic conditions, Dundee was declared an [[Enterprise Zone]] in January 1984. In 1983, the first [[Sinclair Research Ltd|Sinclair]] [[ZX Spectrum]] [[home computers]] were produced in Dundee by [[Timex Corporation|Timex]]. In the same year the company broke production records, despite a [[sit-in]] by workers protesting job cuts and plans to demolish one of the factory buildings to make way for a supermarket. Timex closed its Dundee plant in 1993 following an acrimonious six month [[industrial dispute]].<ref>{{cite news

===Modern day===
As in the rest of Scotland manufacturing industries are being gradually replaced by a [[mixed economy]], although 13.5% of the workforce still work in the manufacturing sector, higher than the Scottish and UK average, and more than double that of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. The main new growth sectors have been [[software development]] and [[biotechnology]] along with retail. The city has a small financial, banking and insurance sector, employing 11% of the workforce.

==Transport==
 
Dundee is served by the [[A90 road]] which connects the city to the [[M90 motorway|M90]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] in the west, and [[Forfar]] and [[Aberdeen]] in the north. The part of the road that is in the city is a [[dual carriageway]] and forms the city's main bypass on its north side, known as the ''Kingsway'', which can become very busy at rush hour. To the east, the [[A92 road|A92]] connects the city to [[Monifieth]] and [[Arbroath]]. The A92 also connects the city to the county of [[Fife]] on the south side of the Tay estuary via a [[Tay Road Bridge|toll bridge]], although tolls are only charged for southbound traffic heading into Fife. The main southern route around the city is Riverside Drive and Riverside Avenue (the A991), that runs alongside the Tay from a junction with the A90 in the west, to the city centre where it joins the A92 at the bridge. 
[[Image:DundeeOverBridge.JPG|thumb|200px|Dundee viewed across the [[River Tay|Tay estuary]] from the southern side. The hill in the background is [[Dundee law]] which is situated in approximately the centre of the city. The bridge on the left is the [[Tay Road Bridge]]]]
Dundee has an extensive public bus transport system, with the [[Seagate Bus Station]] serving as the city's main terminus. [[Travel Dundee]] operates most of the intra-city services, with other more rural services operated by [[Stagecoach Strathtay]]. The city's two railway stations are the main [[Dundee railway station|Dundee (Tay Bridge) Station]], which is situated near the waterfront and the much smaller [[Broughty Ferry railway station|Broughty Ferry Station]], which is further east in [[Broughty Ferry]]. These are complimented by the stations at [[Invergowrie|Invergowrie railway station]], [[Balmossie railway station|Balmossie]] and [[Monifieth|Monifieth railway station]]. Passenger services at Dundee are provided by [[First ScotRail]], [[Virgin Cross Country]] and [[GNER]].

Dundee is home to one [[independent school|independent]] [[school]], the [[High School of Dundee]], which was founded in the 13th century by the [[Abbot]] and [[monks]] of [[Lindores]]. Early students included [[William Wallace]], [[Hector Boece]] and [[James, John and Robert Wedderburn]], the authors of ''[[The Gude and Godlie Ballatis]]'', one of the most important literary works of the [[Scottish Reformation]]. It was the earliest [[Reformed]] school in Scotland, having adopted the new religion in 1554.

The most prominent of Dundee's [[state school|state]] [[secondary school]]s are the [[Harris Academy]], [[Morgan Academy]] and [[Lawside Academy]]. The Harris Academy was founded in 1885 and is the largest state school in the city. Former pupils include MP [[George Galloway]], professional footballer [[Christian Dailly]] and the former vice-chairman of [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers Football Club]], [[Donald Findlay]]. The Morgan Academy dates back to 1888 when the Dundee Burgh School Board bought Morgan hospital and reopened it as a school. The school and the prior hospital take their names from [[John Morgan]], who bequeathed much of his fortune to establish a residential institution. The building was gutted by fire in 2001 but has since been restored and updated. Lawside Academy was established by the [[Sisters of Mercy]] in the late 19th century and, before the introduction of comprhensive schools in the 1970s, served as the only Catholic academy for many miles, with students travelling from [[Perth]], [[Arbroath]], [[Forfar]] and [[Cupar]]. The school moved to its present site in 1966.

==Religious sites==
[[Image:Dundee Parish Church, St Mary's.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Dundee Parish Church, St Mary's is one of two of the city's ''City Churches'']]
The City Churches, [[Dundee Parish Church (St Mary's)]] and the [[Steeple Church]], are the most prominent [[Church of Scotland]] buildings in Dundee. They are on the site of the medieval parish kirk of [[St Mary]], of which only the 15th century west tower survives. The attached church was once the largest parish church in medieval Scotland. Dundee was unusual among Scottish medieval burghs in having two parish kirks; the second, dedicated to [[St Clement]], has disappeared, but its site was approximately that of the present City Square. In the [[Middle Ages]] Dundee was also the site of houses of the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] (Blackfriars), and [[Franciscans]] (Greyfriars), and had a number of hospitals and chapels. These establishments were sacked during the [[Reformation]] in the 16th century and have been reduced to sites.

The Church of Scotland [[Presbyterian polity|Presbytery]] of Dundee currently consists of 45 congregations although, due to dwindling numbers, many now share a [[Minister (religion)|minister]]. [[Robert Murray McCheyne]], who was the minister of St Peter's (now [[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]) from 1838 until his death in 1843, led a significant religious revival in Dundee.<ref>{{gutenberg|no=15251|name=The Biography of Robert Murray M'Cheyne ''by Andrew A. Bonar'}}</ref> There are two [[cathedral]]s in the city&mdash;[[St Paul's Cathedral, Dundee|St. Paul's]] ([[Scottish Episcopal Church|Scottish Episcopal]]) and St. Andrew's ([[Roman Catholic]]).

The [[Catholic]] community is part of the [[Diocese of Dunkeld]] which is led by bishop [[Vincent Paul Logan]]. The fact that 3 of the city's 10 secondary schools are Roman Catholic attests to a sizable Catholic community, an unusual occurrence in the East of Scotland. By way of comparison, Edinburgh (almost 3 times the size of Dundee) also has 3 Catholic secondary schools and Aberdeen only 1. There are 18 Catholic parishes (including the University Chaplaincy) within the boundaries of Dundee City. A recent influx of people from Poland has led to the [[Pallotines]] establishing a presence in the community, and they have taken up residence in the parish dedicated to [[Saint]] [[Francis of Assisi]].

[[Muslim]]s are served by a large [[mosque]], several secondary mosques and the Al Maktoum Institute of Islamic and Arabic Studies which opened in 2000. Scotland's only private [[Islamic]] school, for girls, is located in Broughty Ferry.  [[Halal]] stores and restaurants, along with specialist shops selling Asian clothes and accessories can be found in and around the [[Hilltown, Dundee|Hilltown]] area.

A recorded [[Jewish]] community has existed in the city since the 19th century. The present orthodox [[synagogue]] at Dudhope Park was built in the 1970s, with the Hebrew Burial Grounds located around three miles to the east. There is also a [[Hindu]] [[mandir]] and [[Sikh]] [[gurdwara]] located in the city.

Various smaller venues host local and international musicians during Dundee's annual [[Jazz]], [[Guitar]] and [[Blues]] Festivals. An art gallery and an art house cinema are located in   [[Dundee Contemporary Arts]], which opened in 1999 in the city's cultural quarter.
