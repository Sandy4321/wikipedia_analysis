The '''Sierra Nevada upper montane forest''' is a [[vegetation type]] found below the [[treeline]] in the United States [[Sierra Nevada (US)|Sierra Nevada]] range.<ref name=SNW>{{cite book|last1=Wiese|first1=Karen|title=Sierra Nevada Wildflowers: a Field Guide to Common Wildflowers and Shrubs of the Sierra Nevada, including Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon National Parks|date=2013|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|isbn=0762780347|edition=2nd}}</ref> It is generally located above the [[mixed coniferous forest]] and below the [[alpine zone]].<ref name=SNW/>  Overstory trees are typically cone shaped to shed the snow.<ref name=SNW/>

Characteristic trees including lodgepole pine (''[[Pinus contorta]]''), Jeffrey pine (''[[Pinus jeffreyi]]''), western white pine (''[[Pinus monticola]]'') Caifornia red fir (''[[Abies magnifica]]''), and Sierra juniper (''[[Juniperus grandis]]''), and typical understory trees and shrubs such as huckleberry oak (''[[Quercus vaccinifolia]]'') and red heather (''[[Phyllodoce breweri]]'').<ref name=SNW/>

==Environment==
On the western slopes of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] range, upper montane vegetation can be found at elevations from {{convert|5500|to|7500|ft|m}} in the northern part of the range, {{convert|6500|to|8000|ft|m}} in the central part, and {{convert|8000|to|10000|ft|m}} in the southern part.<ref name=SNW/> On the eastern slopes, it is at higher elevations. Precipitation in areas of upper montane forest vegetation type is {{convert|35|to|65|ft|m}}, mostly as snowfall.<ref name=SNW/> Summer high temperatures range from {{convert|73|to|85|F|C}}, and winter lows are below {{convert|26|F|C}}.<ref name=SNW/> Growing season is about four months because of long-lasting, deep snow.<ref name=SNW/>
