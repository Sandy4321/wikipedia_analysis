'''Alfred Charles Kinsey''' (June 23, 1894 &ndash; August 25, 1956) was an American [[biologist]] and professor of [[entomology]] and [[zoology]], who in 1947 founded the Institute for [[Sex]] Research at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/origins.html|title=Origin of the Institute |accessdate=2010-03-30|publisher=The Kinsey Institute}}</ref> now known as the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction]], as well as producing the [[Kinsey Reports]] and the [[Kinsey scale]]. Kinsey's research on [[human sexuality]], foundational to the modern field of [[sexology]], provoked controversy in the 1940s and 1950s. His work has profoundly influenced social and cultural values in the United States and many other countries.

== Biography==
{{unsourced section|date=December 2011}}
Alfred Kinsey was born on June 23, 1894, in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]],  to Alfred Seguine Kinsey and Sarah Ann Charles. Kinsey was the eldest of three children. His mother had received little formal education; his father was a professor at [[Stevens Institute of Technology]].

===Early life and education===
Kinsey's parents were poor for most of his childhood, and the family often could not afford proper medical care. This may have led to a young Kinsey receiving inadequate treatment for a variety of diseases including [[rickets]], [[rheumatic fever]], and [[typhoid fever]]. This health record indicates that Kinsey received suboptimal exposure to sunlight (the cause of rickets in those days before milk and other foods were fortified with [[vitamin D]]) and lived in unsanitary conditions for at least part of his childhood. Rickets led to a curvature of the spine, which resulted in a slight stoop that prevented Kinsey from being [[The Draft|drafted]] in 1917 for [[World War I]].

Kinsey's parents were extremely devout Christians; this left a powerful imprint on the man for the rest of his life. His father was known as one of the most devout members of the local [[Methodism|Methodist]] church and as a result most of Kinsey's social interactions were with other members of the church, often merely as a silent observer while his parents discussed religion with similarly devout adults.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/kinsey/peopleevents/p_kinsey.html American Experience | Kinsey | People & Events | PBS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Kinsey's father imposed strict rules on the household including mandating Sunday as a day of prayer (and little else).

At a young age, Kinsey showed great interest in nature and camping. He worked and camped with the local [[YMCA]] often throughout his early years. He enjoyed these activities to such an extent that he intended to work professionally for the YMCA after his education was completed. Even Kinsey's senior undergraduate thesis for psychology, a dissertation on the [[group dynamics]] of young boys, echoed this interest. He joined the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] when a troop was formed in his community. His parents strongly supported this (and joined as well) because the Boy Scouts was an organization heavily grounded on the principles of Christianity. Kinsey worked his way up through the Scouting ranks to earn [[Eagle Scout rank (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] in 1913, making him one of the earliest Eagle Scouts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/kinsey/peopleevents/p_kinsey.html |title=Alfred Charles Kinsey (1894-1956) |accessdate=2006-11-09 |work=American Experience: Kinsy |publisher=PBS}}</ref> Despite earlier disease having weakened his heart, Kinsey followed an intense sequence of difficult hikes and camping expeditions throughout his early life.

In high school, Kinsey was a quiet but hard-working student. While attending [[Columbia High School (New Jersey)|Columbia High School]], he was not interested in sports, but devoted his energy to academic work and the piano. At one time, Kinsey had hoped to become a concert pianist, but decided to concentrate on his scientific pursuits instead. Kinsey's ability early on to spend immense amounts of time deeply focused on study was a trait that would serve him well in college and during his professional career. He seemed not to have formed strong social relationships during high school, but earned respect for his academic ability. While there, Kinsey became interested in biology, [[botany]] and [[zoology]]. Kinsey was later to claim that his high school biology teacher, Natalie Roeth, was the most important influence on his decision to become a scientist. Kinsey approached his father with plans to study [[botany]] at college. His father demanded that he study engineering at [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] in Hoboken. Kinsey was unhappy at Stevens, and later remarked that his time there was one of the most wasteful periods of his life.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Regardless, he continued his obsessive commitment to studying. At Stevens, he primarily took courses related to English and engineering, but was unable to satisfy his interest in biology. At the end of two years at Stevens, Kinsey gathered the courage to confront his father about his interest in biology and his intent to continue studying at [[Bowdoin College]] in Maine.

In the fall of 1914, Kinsey entered Bowdoin College, where he became familiar with insect research under [[Manton Copeland]], and was admitted to the [[Zeta Psi]] fraternity, in whose house he lived for much of his time at college.<ref>{{Cite document |last=Weinberg |first=Martin S. |year=1976 |title=Sex Research: Studies from the Kinsey Institute |pages=25 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |isbn= |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Gathorne-Hardy |first=Jonathan |year=2000 |title=Sex, the Measure of All Things: A Life of Alfred C.

It was there that Kinsey studied applied biology under [[William Morton Wheeler]], a scientist who made outstanding contributions to [[entomology]]. Under Wheeler, Kinsey worked almost completely autonomously, which suited both men quite well.

Kinsey chose to do his doctoral thesis on [[gall wasp]]s, and began collecting samples of the species with zeal. He traveled widely and took 26 detailed measurements on hundreds of thousands of gall wasps, and his methodology was itself an important contribution to entomology as a science. Kinsey was granted a [[Sc.D.]] degree in 1919 by [[Harvard University]], and published several papers in 1920 under the auspices of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York, introducing the gall wasp to the scientific community and laying out its [[phylogeny]]. Of the more than 18 million insects in the museum's collection, some 5 million are gall wasps collected by Kinsey.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Yudell |first=Michael |title=Kinsey's Other Report |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1134/is_6_108/ai_55127889 |journal=Natural History |issn=0028-0712 |date=July 1, 1999 |volume=108 |issue=6| postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

Kinsey wrote a widely used high-school textbook, ''An Introduction to Biology'', which was published in October 1926.<ref>{{cite book|title=Kinsey, A Biography|first=Cornelia V.|last=Christenson|year=1971|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|page=57|isbn=0-253-14625-9}}</ref> The book endorsed evolution{{Request quotation|date=November 2010}} and unified, at the introductory level, the previously separate fields of zoology and botany.<ref>{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Biology|first=Alfred Charles|last=Kinsey|editor=William Fletcher Russell|year=1927|publisher=Lippincott}}</ref>{{better source|This is a primary source &ndash; the book itself,  and the statement is a [[WP:SYN|synthesis]] of information purportedly in the book.

This book is still regarded as an authoritative source in the area, but is not generally associated with Kinsey. The original draft of the book was written in 1919&ndash;1920, while Kinsey was still a doctoral student at the [[Bussey Institute]] and Fernald was working at the [[Arnold Arboretum]].<ref>Del Tredici, Peter.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and family===
[[File:First Street 1320, Kinsey House, Vinegar Hill HD.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Kinsey's home in Bloomington]]
Kinsey married [[Clara Bracken McMillen]], whom he called Mac, in 1921. They had four children. Their first-born, Donald, died from the acute complications of [[juvenile diabetes]] in 1927, just before his fifth birthday. Daughter Anne was born in 1924, daughter Joan in 1925, and son Bruce in 1928.

Kinsey designed his own house, which was built in the [[Vinegar Hill Historic District|Vinegar Hill]] neighborhood of Bloomington, Indiana at 1320 First Street.  Here, he practiced his deep interest in [[gardening]].<ref>Indiana Historic Sites and Structures Inventory.  ''City of Bloomington Interim Report''.

== Kinsey and sexology ==
=== The Kinsey Reports ===
{{main|Kinsey Reports}}
Kinsey is generally regarded as a the first major figure in American [[sexology]], the systematic, scientific study of [[human sexuality]].  He initially became interested in the different forms of sexual practices around 1933, after discussing the topic extensively with a colleague, Robert Kroc.  It is likely that Kinsey's study of the variations in mating practices among [[gall wasp]]s led him to wonder how widely varied sexual practices among humans were. During this work, he developed a scale measuring sexual orientation, now known as the [[Kinsey Scale]] which ranges from 0 to 6, where 0 is exclusively [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and 6 is exclusively [[homosexuality|homosexual]]; a rating of ''X'', for [[asexuality|asexual]], was added later by Kinsey's associates.

In 1935, Kinsey delivered a lecture to a faculty discussion group at Indiana University, his first public discussion of the topic, wherein he attacked the "widespread ignorance of sexual structure and physiology" and promoted his view that "delayed marriage" (that is, delayed sexual experience) was psychologically harmful. Kinsey obtained research funding from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], which enabled him to inquire into human sexual behavior. His ''[[Kinsey Reports]]''<U+2014>starting with the publication of ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]'' in 1948, followed in 1953 by ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]''<U+2014>reached the top of bestseller lists  and turned Kinsey into an instant celebrity. Articles about him appeared in magazines such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Life magazine|Life]]'', ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'', and ''[[McCall's]]''. Kinsey's reports, which led to a storm of controversy, are regarded by many as an enabler of the ''[[sexual revolution]]'' of the 1960s and 1970s. Indiana University's president [[Herman B Wells]] defended Kinsey's research in what became a well-known test of [[academic freedom]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

=== Controversial aspects of his work ===

Kinsey's sex research went beyond theory and interview to include observation of and participation in sexual activity, sometimes involving co-workers. He justified this as being necessary to gain the confidence of his research subjects. He encouraged his staff to do likewise, and engage in a wide range of sexual activity, to the extent they felt comfortable; he argued that this would help his interviewers understand the participant responses.<ref name="Vern1">{{cite journal|first=Vern L.|last=Bullough|title=Book Review "Alfred C.

Kinsey collected sexual material from around the world, which brought him to the attention of U.S. Customs when they seized some pornographic films in 1956; he died before this matter was resolved legally.<ref name="pbs"/>

Kinsey wrote about pre-adolescent [[orgasm]]s using data in tables 30 to 34 of the male volume, which report observations of orgasms in over three-hundred children between the ages of five months and fourteen years.<ref name="kinsey-tables">{{cite book|title= Sexual Behavior in the Human Male  |last= Kinsey|first= Alfred Charles|coauthors=Clyde Eugene Mart|year= 1998 (reprint of 1948 original)|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=178<U+2013>180 |isbn= 0-253-33412-8}}</ref> This information was said to have come from adults' childhood memories, or from parent or teacher observation.<ref name="kinsey-inst">[http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/controversy%202.htm Kinsey Institute statement denies child abuse in study]</ref> Kinsey said he also interviewed nine men who had sexual experiences with children, and who told him about the children's responses and reactions.

== Kinsey in the media ==
[[Image:Time-1953-08-24.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' cover, August 24, 1953. Under Kinsey's name, the caption reads "Reflections in the mirror of Venus."]]
The popularity of ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'' prompted widespread media interest in 1948. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine declared, "Not since ''Gone With the Wind'' had booksellers seen anything like it."<ref name="Time1">{{cite news | date = 1948-03-01 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,794270,00.html| title = How to Stop Gin Rummy| work = Time | accessdate = 2007-09-11}}</ref> The first pop culture references to Kinsey appeared not long after the book's publication: "[R]ubber-faced comic [[Martha Raye]] [sold] a half-million copies of 'Ooh, Dr. Kinsey!'"<ref>{{cite news | date = 2004-12-12 | url =http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/arts/12rich.html?ex=1260334800&en=0297f1d1dff963fa&ei=5088| title = The Plot Against Sex in America| work = New York Times | accessdate = 2007-09-11 | first=Frank | last=Rich}}</ref> [[Cole Porter]]'s song "[[Too Darn Hot]]", from the Tony Award<U+2013>winning Broadway musical ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'', devoted its bridge to an analysis of the Kinsey report and the "average man's favorite sport." In 1949, [[Mae West]], reminiscing on the days when the word "sex" was rarely uttered, said of Kinsey, "That guy merely makes it easy for me.

The publication of ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'' prompted even more intensive news coverage: Kinsey appeared on the cover of the August 24, 1953, issue of ''Time''. The national newsmagazine featured two articles on the scientist, one focusing on his research career and new book,<ref name="Time3">{{cite news | date = 1953-08-24 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,818752,00.html | title = 5,940 Women | work = Time | accessdate = 2007-09-11}}</ref> the other on his background, personality, and lifestyle.<ref name="Time4">{{Cite web | date = 1953-08-24 | url = http://aolsvc.timeforkids.kol.aol.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,818753-1,00.html | title = Dr. Kinsey of Bloomington | work = Time | accessdate = 2007-09-11}}</ref> In the magazine's cover portrait, "Flowers, birds, and a bee surround Kinsey; the mirror-of-Venus female symbol decorates his bow tie."<ref>Reinisch (1990), p. xvii.</ref> The lead article concludes with the following observation: "'Kinsey...has done for sex what Columbus did for geography,' declared a pair of enthusiasts. Kinsey's work contains much that is valuable, but it must not be mistaken for the last word."<ref name="Time3"/>

==Death==
Kinsey died on August 25, 1956, at the age of 62. The cause of death was reported to be a heart ailment and [[pneumonia]].<ref name = "APobit">{{cite news|url=http://writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/kinsey.html|title=Dr. Kinsey is Dead; Sex Researcher, 62|work=New York Times|date=08-26-1956}}</ref> This passage was written about his work in ''The New York Times'':

{{quote|The untimely death of Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey takes from the American scene an important and valuable, as well as controversial, figure. Whatever may have been the reaction to his findings<U+2014>and to the unscrupulous use of some of them<U+2014>the fact remains that he was first, last, and always a scientist.  In the long run it is probable that the values of his contribution to contemporary thought will lie much less in what he found out than in the method he used and his way of applying it.  Any sort of scientific approach to the problems of sex is difficult because the field is so deeply overlaid with such things as moral precept, taboo, individual and group training, and long established behavior patterns.  Some of these may be good in themselves, but they are no help to the scientific and empirical method of getting at the truth. Dr. Kinsey cut through this overlay with detachment and precision.  His work was conscientious and comprehensive.  Naturally, it will receive a serious setback with his death.  Let us earnestly hope that the scientific spirit that inspired it will not be similarly impaired.<ref>Quoted in Pomeroy (1972).</ref>}}

==Legacy in popular culture==
After the publication of [[Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]], a character called "Dr. Kinsey" appeared on the [[September 15]], [[1953]] [[television]] episode of [[The Jack Benny Program]] as a bow-tied man interviewing a young woman on board a [[cruise ship]] that has left [[Hawaii]].  When "Dr. Kinsey" identifies himself to [[Jack Benny]], Benny steps away in embarrassment.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Jack Benny Show from September 15 1953|url=http://www.archive.org/details/Jack_Benny_09_15_1953|accessdate=6 November 2011}}</ref>   

The 2000s have seen renewed interest in Kinsey. The musical ''Dr. Sex'' focuses on the relationship between Kinsey, his wife, and their shared lover Wally Matthews (based on [[Clyde Martin]]). The play<U+2014>with score by Larry Bortniker, book by Bortniker and Sally Deering<U+2014>premiered in Chicago in 2003, winning seven [[Joseph Jefferson Awards|Jeff Awards]]. It was produced off-Broadway in 2005. The 2004 [[biographical film]] ''[[Kinsey (film)|Kinsey]]'', written and directed by [[Bill Condon]], stars [[Liam Neeson]] as the scientist and [[Laura Linney]] as his wife. In 2004 as well, [[T. Coraghessan Boyle]]'s novel about Kinsey, ''[[The Inner Circle (novel)|The Inner Circle]]'', was published. The following year, [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] produced the documentary ''Kinsey'' in cooperation with the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction|Kinsey Institute]], which allowed access to many of its files. ''Mr. Sex'', a [[BBC]] radio play by Steve Coombes concerning Kinsey and his work, won the 2005 Imison Award.<ref>{{Cite web| url =http://www.suttonelms.org.uk/imison2005.html| title =Imison Award 2005| publisher= Society of Authors| accessdate = 2007-09-12}}</ref>
