'''Bergamo''' ('''''B<U+00E8>rghem''''' in [[Eastern_Lombard|Lombard]]) is a town in [[Lombardy]], [[Italy]], about 40km northeast of [[Milan]]. The commune is home to c. 117,000 inhabitants. It is served by [[Orio al Serio International Airport]], which also serves the [[Province of Bergamo]], and to a lesser extent [[Milan]]. The foothills of the Alps begin immediately north of the town.

==History==
Bergamo occupies the site of the ancient town of ''Bergomum'', founded as a settlement of the [[List_of_Celtic_tribes|Celtic tribe]] of [[Cenomani (Cisalpine Gaul)|Cenomani]]. In [[49 BC]] it became a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] municipality, containing c. 10,000 inhabitants at its peak. An important hub on the military road between [[Friuli]] and [[Raetia]], it was destroyed by [[Attila]] in the [[5th century]]. 

From the 6th century Bergamo was the seat of one of the most important [[Lombard]] duchies of northern Italy, together with [[Brescia]], [[Trento]] and [[Cividale del Friuli]]: its first Lombard duke was Wallaris. After the conquest by [[Charlemagne]] of the Lombard Kingdom, it became the seat of a county under one Auteramus (died 816).

From the 11th century onwards Bergamo was an independent commune, taking part in the [[Lombard League]] which defeated [[Frederick I Barbarossa]] in 1165. Caught in the bitter fights between [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], led in the city by the Colleoni and the Suardi respectively, from [[1264]] Bergamo was intermittently under the rule of Milan. In [[1331]] it gave itself to [[John of Bohemia]], but later the Visconti of Milan reconquered it. After a short conquest by the [[Malatesta]] in [[1407]], in [[1428]] it fell under the control of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]], remaining part of it until [[1797]]. Notably, the Venetians fortified the higher portion of the town (see Main sights section).

In [[1815]] it was assigned to [[Austria]]. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] freed it [[1859]], and thenceforth Bergamo was part of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].

Bergamo is the traditional birthplace of [[Arlecchino]] and [[Brighella]], two popular characters of the [[commedia dell'arte]],

Bergamo has a prominent place in music history.  The large [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church of Santa Maria Maggiore, begun in [[1137]], had a continuous and well-documented tradition of music teaching and singing for more than eight hundred years.  Since the town was under Venetian control, the musical style of the Venetians was imported as well; in particular, a large instrumental ensemble grew up to support the choral singing.  Composers such as [[Gasparo Alberti]] produced music with [[polyphony]] using two [[organ (music)|organs]], brass and [[viol]]s, a style usually associated with Venice, but which flourished in the fine acoustic environment of Santa Maria Maggiore.

Prominent musicians born in Bergamo include [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Pietro Locatelli]], [[Antonio Lolli]], [[Gianluigi Trovesi]], and Elio Picchetti.  [[Alessandro Grandi]], one of the most progressive composers of the early [[17th century]] after [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]], was ''maestro di cappella'' there until his death in the plague of [[1630]]; [[Tarquinio Merula]], an even more progressive composer, and one of the founders of the early sonata, took over his post.

Elio Picchetti is a distinguished engineer who is involved in the development of GPS based aircraft landing systems. While sailing his boat around the world he spends his days playing the guitar and philosophising.

A famous musician who lived in Bergamo was maestro [[Gianandrea Gavazzeni]].

Bergamo was the hometown and last resting place of [[Enrico Rastelli]], a highly technical and world famous juggler who lived in the town and, in [[1931]], died there at the early age of 34. There is a life-sized statue to Rastelli within his mausoleum.

==Main sights==
The town has two centres: "Citt<U+00E0> alta" (upper city), a hilltop medieval town, surrounded by 17th century cyclopic defensive walls, and the "Citt<U+00E0> bassa" (lower city). The two parts of the town are connected by [[funicular/cable car]], roads and foot-paths (the most convenient being immediately adjacent the funicular station). Parking spaces are very limited in the upper city and non-local traffic is banned on weekends.

===Citt<U+00E0> alta===
The upper city, surrounded by Venetian walls built in the 17th century, forms the historic centre of Bergamo.

It includes numerous historical monuments:
*''Piazza Vecchia'' (old square)
*''Palazzo della Ragione''. It was the seat of the administration of the city in the communal age. It is now the site of exhibitions. Erected in the 12th century, it was rebuilt in the late 16th century by Pietro Isabello. The fa<U+00E7>ade has the lion of St. Mark over a mullioned window, testifying to the long period of Venetian dominance. The atrium has a well-preserved 18th century [[sundial]].
*''[[Santa Maria Maggiore, Bergamo|Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]]'' (Saint Mary Major). It was built from 1137 on the site of a previous religious edifice of the 7th century. Construction lasted until the 15th century. Of this first building remains the external Romanesque structure and the Greek cross plan, while the interior was widely modified in the 16th and 17th centuries. Noteworthy are the great Crucifix and the tomb of [[Gaetano Donizetti]]. The dome has frescoes by [[Giovanbattista Tiepolo]].
*''[[Cappella Colleoni]]'' ([[bartolomeo Colleoni|Colleoni]] chapel), annexed to Santa Maria Maggiore, a masterwork of Renaissance architecture and decorative art.
*The ''Rocca'' (Castle). It was begun in [[1331]] on hill of the Sant'Eufemia by William of Castelbarco, vicar of [[John of Bohemia]], and later completed by [[Azzone Visconti]]. A wider citadel was also added, but it is now partly lost. The Venetians built a large tower in the ''Rocca'', as well as a line of walls (''Mura Veneziane'') 6,200 metres long.
*''Palazzo della Ragione'' and the nearby [[Biblioteca Angelo Mai]] (''Palazzo Nuovo''), designed by [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]].

The citt<U+00E0> alta is also home to two museums, the ''Museo Civico Archeologico'' (Archaeological Civic Museum) and the [[Museo di Scienze Naturali Enrico Caffi]] (Caffi Natural Science Museum).

 

===Citt<U+00E0> bassa===
The lower city, having expanded rapidly during the 20th century, is the modern centre of Bergamo.

Of artistic importance are the [[Accademia Carrara|Pinacoteca dell'Accademia Carrara]] (picture museum of Carrara academy), known as "Accademia Carrara" and the nearby Galleria d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea (gallery of modern and contemporary art), known as GAMEC.
The lower part of the city is divided into several distinct boroughs: [[Colognola]], [[Valtesse]], [[Redona]], [[Borgo Palazzo]], [[Celadina]], Campagnola, Boccaleone, Longuelo.

==Trivia/Miscellaneous==
Angelo Roncalli later to become Pope John XXIII ( Oct 28, 1958 - June 3,1963) was born in the Bergamo province Sotto Il Monte on November 25, 1981
*The city is home to [[Costantino Rocca]], the only Italian golfer to play in the [[Ryder Cup]].
*The town hosted the seventh [[Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]] in [[1951]].
*The town has a [[Serie A]] football team called [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]].
*For about 55 years, from 1945 to 2000, the town was the site of the headquarters of the Mechanized [[Infantry Brigade "Legnano"]]
*Every year the town used to host an important poetry event called "BergamoPoesia"
* The town has a woman's [[volleyball]] team named [[Foppapedretti Bergamo]].
