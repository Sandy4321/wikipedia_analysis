At the [[1997 NHL Entry Draft]], Luongo was selected in the first round, fourth overall, by the [[New York Islanders]].

Although the Islanders planned to have Luongo play in the NHL for the [[1998<U+2013>99 NHL season|1998<U+2013>99 season]], an inconsistent performance at training camp led to Luongo's return to the QMJHL that season.<ref name=NYTimes>{{vcite news |title=Hockey; A Goalie Is in the Islanders' Future |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E3DD1631F933A25752C0A96F958260 |date=1999-01-10 |accessdate=2008-08-24 |work=[[New York Times]] |author=Tarik El-Bashir }}</ref> Due to having failed to come to terms on a contract before October 1, 1998, Luongo was not allowed to be called up to the Islanders from junior over the course of the subsequent season.<ref name=NYTimes/> He started the season with Val-d'Or but was traded to the [[Acadie-Bathurst Titan]] during the [[1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|1999 World Junior Championships]] for the remainder of the [[1998<U+2013>99 QMJHL season|1998<U+2013>99 season]].
