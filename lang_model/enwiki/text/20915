'''Ono no Komachi''' (<U+5C0F><U+91CE> <U+5C0F><U+753A> or <U+304A><U+306E><U+306E><U+3053><U+307E><U+3061>) (c. [[825 in poetry|825]] &mdash; c. [[900 in poetry|900]]) was a famous Japanese [[waka (poetry)|waka]] poet, one of the ''Rokkasen'' &mdash; the [[Six best Waka poets]] of the early [[Heian period]]. She was noted as a rare beauty; Komachi is a symbol of a beautiful woman in [[Japan]]. She is also numbered as one of the [[Thirty-six Poetry Immortals]].

==Life and legends==
The place of Komachi's birth and death is uncertain. According to one tradition, she was born in what is now [[Akita prefecture|Akita Prefecture]], daughter of [[Yoshisada]], "Lord of Dewa".<ref name="women">Page 141 of ''Woman poets of Japan'', 1977, Kenneth Rexroth, Ikuko Atsumi, ISBN 0-8112-0820-6; previously published as ''The Burning Heart'' by [[The Seabury Press]].</ref> Her social status is also uncertain. She may have been a low-ranking consort or a lady-in-waiting of an emperor, possibly [[Emperor Nimmyo|Emperor Nimmy<U+014D>]] (r. [[833]]-[[850]]). 

As a poet, Komachi specialized in erotic love themes, expressed in complex poems.<ref name="women2">"Her beauty may be legendary but her rank as one of the greatest erotic poets in any language is not. Her poems begin the extreme verbal complexity which distinguishes the poetry of the ''Kokinsh<U+016B> Anthology'' from the presentational immediacy of the ''[[Man'y<U+014D>sh<U+016B>]]''. Page 141 of ''Woman poets of Japan'', 1977, Kenneth Rexroth, Ikuko Atsumi, ISBN 0-8112-0820-6; previously published as ''The Burning Heart'' by [[The Seabury Press]].</ref> Most of her [[waka_(poetry)|waka]] are about anxiety, solitude or passionate love. She is the only female poet referred to in the preface of the ''[[Kokin Wakash<U+016B>]]'', which describes her style as "containing naivety in old style but also delicacy".

There are legends about Komachi in love. The most famous is a story about her relationship with [[Fukakusa no Shosho]], a high-ranking courtier. Komachi promised that if he visited her continuously for a hundred nights, then she would become his lover. Fukakusa no Shosho visited her every night, but failed once towards the end. Despairing, he fell ill and subsequently died. When Komachi learned of his death she was overcome with sadness.  

==Legacy==
Komachi sometimes features in later period literature, including five<ref>Keene, Donald. ''Twenty Plays of the N<U+014D> Theater.'' Columbia University Press, New York, 1970. Page 67.</ref> [[Noh]] plays: ''[[Sotoba Komachi]]'', ''[[Sekidera Komachi]]'', ''Komachi uta Arasoi'', ''Komachi S<U+014D>shi'' and ''Kayo Komachi''. These works tend to focus on her talent for ''waka'' and her love affairs and the vanity of a life spent indulging in romantic liaisons. Komachi's old age is also frequently portrayed: when she has lost her beauty, has been abandoned by her former lovers, and now regrets her life, wandering around as a lonely beggar woman &mdash; albeit still appreciated by young admirers of her poetry.<ref name="women"/> This is a fictional description influenced by [[Buddhist]] thought and there may be no factual resemblance between this portrait and the historical reality.

In honor of her, the [[Akita Shinkansen]] is nicknamed ''Komachi''. Also, a variety of rice, Akita Komachi, bears her name. One of her 31-syllable poems was chosen by [[Fujiwara no Teika]] as an entry in the very popular anthology [[Hyakunin Isshu]].

Ono no Komachi is also the subject of a modern one-woman play, [http://www.callmekomachi.com ''Call Me Komachi''], produced by Lemon Tart Productions, written by Christie Nieman, directed by Miki Oikawa and starring Kaori Hamamoto. ''Call Me Komachi'' enjoyed successful seasons at various venues in Australia from 2003 to 2006. The play compares and parallels the lives of traditional Geisha with contemporary Japanese schoolgirls in sponsored relationships, known as ''[[enjo k<U+014D>sai]]''.
