==Biography==

===Early life===
Lunch moved to New York City from Rochester at the age of 16<ref name="Masters, Marc 2007, p. 73"/> in 1976 with what she described having nothing but "a small red suitcase, a winter coat, and a big fucking attitude."<ref>{{cite web|title=Lydia Lunch Interview << Money Jungle Safari|url=http://sheltonhull.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/lydia-lunch-interview/|work=[[WordPress]]|accessdate=October 3, 2011|date=October 16, 2008}}</ref> Lunch moved into a communal household of artists and musicians in NYC. Soon [[Willy DeVille]] gave her the name "Lunch" because she often stole lunches from [[The Dead Boys]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artistwiki.com/lydia-lunch/biography |title=Lydia Lunch biography |publisher=Artistwiki.com |date=1959-06-02 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}</ref>

===Music===
After befriending [[Alan Vega]] and [[Martin Rev]] at [[Max's Kansas City]], she founded the short-lived but influential [[No Wave]] band [[Teenage Jesus and the Jerks]], with [[James Chance]].<ref>Masters, Marc. ''No Wave''. London: Black Dog Publishing, 2007, p. 82</ref> Both Teenage Jesus and the Jerks and [[The Contortions]], Chance's subsequent band, played on the No Wave compilation ''[[No New York]]'', produced by [[Brian Eno]]. Lunch later appeared on two songs on ''[[James White and the Blacks]]'' album, ''Off-White''.

Lunch's solo career featured collaborations with musicians such as [[J. G. Thirlwell]], [[Kim Gordon]], [[Thurston Moore]], [[Nick Cave]], [[Marc Almond]], [[Billy Ver Planck]], [[Steven Severin]], [[Robert Quine]], [[Sadie Mae]], [[Rowland S. Howard]], [[Michael Gira]], [[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]], [[Einst<U+00FC>rzende Neubauten]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[Oxbow (band)|Oxbow]], [[Die Haut]], [[Omar Rodriguez-Lopez]], [[Black Sun Productions]], and French band [[Sibyl Vane (band)|Sibyl Vane]], who put one of her poems to music.

In the mid-1980s, she formed her own recording and publishing company called "Widowspeak Productions" (also known as just "Widowspeak"), on which she continues to release her own material, from music to [[spoken word]]. Two albums published by Lunch's label were released in 2013: ''Collision Course & Trust The Witch'', by Big Sexy Noise (released on Cherry Red), and ''Retrovirus'' (released on Interbang Records); both albums are by Lunch's musical projects.<ref>{{cite web|title=Widowspeak Productions|url=http://www.discogs.com/label/27120-Widowspeak-Productions|work=Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=2 January 2014|year=2013}}</ref>

Lunch has recorded and performed as a [[spoken word artist]], collaborating with artists such as [[Exene Cervenka]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[Juan Azulay]], [[Don Bajema]], [[Hubert Selby Jr.]], and [[Emilio Cubeiro]], as well as hosting spoken-word performance night The Unhappy Hour at the [[Parlour Club]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jul/02/news/lv-unhappy2 |title=Tales and Cocktails&nbsp;<U+2013> Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=December 9, 1998 |accessdate=April 3, 2012}}</ref>

===Literature===
In 1997, Lunch released ''Paradoxia'', a loose autobiography, in which she documented her early life, sexual history, [[substance abuse]] and mental health problems.<ref>[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/59917/nothings-shocking-an-interview-with-lydia-lunch/ Nothing's Shocking: An Interview With Lydia Lunch], Drew Fortune, July 18, 2008]</ref> ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out New York]]'' gave it a favorable review,<ref name="timeout1">{{cite web|last=Brown |first=Liz |url=http://newyork.timeout.com/articles/books/22985/paradoxia |title=New York Time Out |publisher=New York Time Out |date=2007-10-04 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}</ref> while [[Bookslut]] ambiguously concluded "It's to the reader to determine whether Lunch's study goes deeper than that, or if instead, it's a kind of literary and philosophical repetition compulsion, a reprisal of greatest hits from male nihilists, sexual adventurers and chroniclers of deviance."<ref name="timeout1"/> ''[[PopMatters]]'' called it a "brutal but boring and predictable circus, about which Lunch shows no emotions. Only fatigue seems to have given her pause."<ref>{{cite web|last=Kantor |first=Matthew |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/paradoxia-by-lydia-lunch |title=PopMatters |publisher=PopMatters |accessdate=2014-06-29}}</ref> Other reviewers praised Lunch's candor while expressing reservations about her prose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://feministreview.blogspot.com/2008/01/paradoxia-predators-diary.html |title=Feminist Review |publisher=Feministreview.blogspot.com |accessdate=2014-06-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enjoy-your-style.com/lydia-lunch-books.html |title=Lydia Lunch's Autobiographies |publisher=Enjoy-your-style.com |date=2013-02-22 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}</ref>

Additionally, Lunch has authored both traditional books and [[comix]] (with award-winning graphic novel artist [[Ted McKeever]]).

===Other work===
In 2007, Lunch appeared on a viral video that was recorded backstage after a [[Joe Rogan]] comedy show, in which she confronts Rogan for making jokes about "dumb women" in his comedy act. The interaction becomes inflamed when Rogan takes exception to Lunch's confrontational approach, whereby she asks the comedian to make eye contact and comments: "I was going to put my cigarette up his nose, but that's okay." Lunch then withdraws from her initial approach, claiming that her cigarette comment was not serious.<ref>{{cite web|title=Joe Rogan VS.

In 2013 Lunch ran self-empowerment workshops in locations such as [[Ojai, California|Ojai]], [[California]], US and [[Rennes]], France. In regard to the Rennes workshop, her inaugural self-empowerment event, Lunch recalled: "Every day people would come in that would have to get a hug. I felt like mother India."<ref name="New" />

In 2004, she left the United States for [[Barcelona]], her residence as of December 2013.<ref name="New">{{cite web|title=Lydia Lunch Through the Years|url=http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/20/lydia-lunch-through-the-years/|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=December 28, 2013}}</ref>
