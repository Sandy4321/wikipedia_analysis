Colonel '''Th<U+00E9>oneste Bagosora''' (born August 16, 1941) is a former [[Rwanda]]n military officer. He is chiefly known for his key role in the 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide]], for which he has been sentenced to life imprisonment by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR).

==History and career==
Bagosora was born in Giciye in what is now [[Nyabihu District]], [[Western Province, Rwanda|Western Province]], [[Rwanda]]. In 1964 he graduated from the ''<U+00C9>cole des officiers'' (Officers' School) in [[Kigali]] with the rank of second lieutenant, and continued his studies in [[France]]. During his military career he served as second-in-command of the ''<U+00C9>cole sup<U+00E9>rieure militaire'' (Superior Military School) in Kigali and as commander of Kanombe military camp.

He was appointed to the position of ''directeur du cabinet'' (chief of staff) in the Ministry of Defence in June 1992. Despite officially retiring from the military on 23 September 1993, he retained this post until fleeing the country in July 1994.

==Role in the genocide==
{{Rquote|right|It seems that, in as much as there was a general organizer of the whole operation, this distinction has to go to Colonel Th<U+00E9>oneste Bagosora.|[[G<U+00E9>rard Prunier]]|''The Rwanda Crisis: History of a Genocide'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1995. ISBN 0-231-10408-1.|align=center}}

Bagosora was born in the same northern region as [[Juv<U+00E9>nal Habyarimana]], the president of Rwanda from 1973 to 1994. He was linked to '''le Clan de Madame''', known later as the ''[[akazu]]'', a group associated with [[Agathe Habyarimana]], the president<U+2019>s wife, who was at the nexus of the [[Hutu Power]] ideology.<ref>Prunier 1995:167</ref>

Although he was present at the negotiations of the [[Arusha Accords]] in August 1993, he never supported them and is widely cited as saying, once everything was signed, that he was returning to Rwanda to "prepare for the apocalypse". [[Luc Marchal]], a Belgian officer, who served as Kigali sector commander in [[UNAMIR]], reported that Bagosora told him that the only way to solve Rwanda<U+2019>s problems was to get rid of the [[Tutsi]].<ref name="Off 2000:48">Off 2000:48</ref>

Bagosora was responsible for establishing paramilitary "self-defense" units, the [[Interahamwe]], that would operate in every commune in the country. These groups were to act in concert with the local police, militias, and military authorities. Bagosora was also responsible for distributing arms and machetes throughout Rwanda. Between January 1993 and March 1994 Rwanda imported more than 500,000 machetes, twice the number than imported in previous years.<ref>Meredith 2005:500<U+2013>501</ref> There were lists drawn up identifying people as enemies. The stage was set.

At about 8:15 pm on the evening of April 6, 1994, President Habyarimana was flying back to Kigali after a meeting when [[Assassination of Habyarimana and Ntaryamira|his plane was struck]] by two missiles fired from the ground. The plane crashed, killing everyone on board. The position of the American, French, and Rwandan governments is that the missiles were fired from the Kanombe barracks, which were controlled by the Presidential Guard, [[Assassination of Habyarimana and Ntaryamira#Responsibility|but that conclusion is disputed]]. News of the President's death was broadcast and the killings began.<ref>Meredith 2005:507</ref>

After the assassination, Colonel Bagosora along with Colonel Rwagafilita gathered supporters and convened a meeting of a Crisis Committee.<ref>Off 2000:48<U+2013>49</ref> [[Romeo Dallaire]], the UN commander was invited, and arrived to find the senior leadership of the Rwandan army.<ref>Dallaire 2003:222</ref> Dallaire rejected Bagosora<U+2019>s proposal of having the military take control of the political situation until they could hand it over to the politicians and he reminded him that Rwanda still had a government headed by Prime Minister [[Agathe Uwilingiyimana]]. Bagosora responded that she was incapable of governing the nation. A few hours later, Madame Agathe was murdered with her husband by members of the Presidential Guard and the army.<ref>Dallaire 2003:245</ref> After Bagosora's failed attempt to have the military take over the role of government, the group proceeded to pick a provisional government. The interim government was a multiparty group, but all came from the hardliner sections of their respective parties.<ref>Prunier 1995:232<U+2013>233</ref>

[[List of events named massacres|Massacres]] began all over the country. Many prominent Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed right away, their names and addresses having been on lists. [[Radio T<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>vision Libre des Mille Collines|Radio Mille Collines]] broadcast incitements to murder. Trucks began arriving to pick up scores of bodies. On the morning of April 7, ten Belgian peacekeepers who had been guarding Prime Minister Agathe and who were witnesses to the government troops laying siege to her residence, were disarmed and taken to Camp Kigali, approximately 200 metres from where Colonel Bagosora was holding a meeting of military officers. The peacekeepers were murdered over the course of several hours by military personnel. During his testimony Colonel Bagosora admitted attending to the scene while the murders were in progress, although claiming he could do nothing to stop the killings. As anticipated, the death of the ten Belgian peacekeepers prompted the withdrawal of most peacekeeping troops from Rwanda, effectively clearing the way for slaughter.

Over the next 100 days, people were being killed at an astonishing rate. The number of dead varies from 800,000 to 1,000,000 people, depending on the source.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Upon the interference of [[Tutsi]] army in response to the genocide, Bagosora fled into neighbouring [[Zaire]]. <U+201C>Fed and protected in [[Great Lakes refugee crisis|refugee camps]] supported by millions of dollars in international aid, the Hutu Power leaders were able to hold regular planning meetings and to recruit new members.<U+201D><ref>Off 2000:248</ref> With Bagosora actively involved, they rebuilt their military structures with the purpose of wiping out the Tutsi population.

===ICTR trial===

Bagosora later moved to Cameroon with several other Hutu Power leaders. It was there that he was detained with [[Andr<U+00E9> Ntagerura]]. In 1997, he first appeared before the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) in [[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]], to face thirteen counts of eleven different international crimes, based on the laws of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The joint trial with three other senior military officers charged as co-conspirators opened on April 2, 2002.

During his trial further evidence was submitted that in 1991 he and other co-accused helped to draft a document where they referred to the Tutsi ethnic group as the "principal enemy" which was widely distributed in the army. They were also accused of supporting the media outlets responsible for spreading hate messages and making lists of victims.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/rwanda/story/0,,2093505,00.html ''Guardian Unlimited'', June 1, 2007]</ref>

The trial wrapped up on June 1, 2007, after five years, with Colonel Th<U+00E9>oneste Bagosora still maintaining his innocence.

On December 18, 2008, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] found Bagosora and two other senior Rwandan army officers, Major [[Aloys Ntabakuze]] and Colonel [[Anatole Nsengiyumva]], guilty of [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crimes]] and sentenced him to [[life imprisonment]].<ref name="AP">{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hhAjYAC6mve6OkZF9W4JEi_PSTeAD955BL081|title=Planner of Rwandan massacres convicted of genocide|last=Chhatbar|first=Sukhdev|date=2008-12-18|work=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref><ref name="Reuters">{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSLI8785620081218?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews|title=Rwanda's Bagosora sentenced to life for genocide|last=Nyakuiru|first=Frank|date=2008-12-18|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref> In ruling that life imprisonment was the appropriate sentence for Bagosora the three trial judges concurred that "The toll of human suffering was immense as a result of crimes which could have only occurred with his orders and authorisation."<ref>Paragraph 2266, part 3.1, page 571, Judgement and Sentence, 18 December 2008, ''The Prosecutor v.

In addition, the court found Bagosora guilty of orchestrating the mass killings of Tutsis in [[Kigali]] and [[Gisenyi]]. However, the trial court held there was a reasonable doubt that events prior to April 6 could only be explained by Bagosora conspiring with others, so he was therefore acquitted on a charge of conspiracy to commit genocide prior to April 6, 1994.<ref name="NYT"/>

In the end result at trial, former Colonel Theoneste Bagosora was convicted of 10 counts of eight different crimes, including genocide, two counts of murder (one for Rwandans and one for peacekeepers), Extermination, Rape, Persecution, Other Inhumane Acts, two counts of Violence to Life (one for Rwandans and one for peacekeepers) as well as Outrages Upon Personal Dignity.<ref>Paragraph 2258, Chapter V: "Verdict", page 568, Judgement and Sentence, 18 December 2008, ''The Prosecutor v.
