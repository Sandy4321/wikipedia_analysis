'''Line 18 - Bronze''' is a future project of the [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo Metro]]. It will link [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (city)|S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] to the southeast portion of the [[Greater S<U+00E3>o Paulo]], ending in [[S<U+00E3>o Bernardo do Campo]]. The line is expected to be the first one in the local [[rapid transit]] system to go beyond the city limits. <ref name="DGABC1" /> <ref name="OESP20120203"> {{cite news | newspaper = O Estado de S.

== Background ==

Preliminary studies for a city passenger rail transportation system in S<U+00E3>o Paulo were sketched as of [[1888]] <ref name="OESP20130125"> {{cite news | newspaper = O Estado de S. Paulo | language = Portuguese | date = January 25, 2013 | accessdate = March 13, 2014 | url = http://acervo.estadao.com.br/pagina/#!/20130125-43564-nac-58-cid-h4-not/busca/Alberto+Kuhlmann | title = Em 1888, engenheiro alem<U+00E3>o tentou - sem sucesso - fazer monotrilho no centro | trans_title = In 1888, a German engineer tried - unsuccessfully - to build a monorail downtown | page = H4 }} </ref>, and later some of them included the so-called [[ABC region]]. One of them cited a [[suspension railway]] as an alternative for the city and its neighborhoods in the [[1960s]], inspired on [[Wuppertal Suspension Railway]] and [[SAFEGE]] models, including a suggestion to link ABC to [[Parque Dom Pedro II]] through [[Tamanduate<U+00ED> River]]. <ref name="OESP19660102"> {{cite news | date = January 2, 1966 | newspaper = O Estado de S. Paulo | accessdate = March 13, 2014 | language = Portuguese | url = http://acervo.estadao.com.br/pagina/#!/19660102-27824-nac-0020-999-20-not/busca/ABC+linha+metr%C3%B4 | title = Preconizado o metro a<U+00E9>reo como solu<U+00E7><U+00E3>o para a Capital | trans_title = Predicting elevated metro as a solution for the capital | page = 20 }} </ref>

S<U+00E3>o Paulo Metro was established as a company in [[1968]] and started its revenue service in [[1974]]. <ref name="MSP1"> {{cite web | website = S<U+00E3>o Paulo Metro website | title = About Us | url = http://www.metro.sp.gov.br/en/metro/about-us/index.aspx | accessdate = March 12, 2014 }} </ref> Its justification was based upon the fast growth of the city of S<U+00E3>o Paulo, and its car fleet as well, with all the problems emerging due to that. The original plan suggested the construction of four lines, all of them enclosed within the city's limits, although predicting transfer stations to the commuter rail system and the buses. The southeasternmost station of the system was predicted to be settled near [[Via Anchieta]] (and bearing such name), a state road linking S<U+00E3>o Paulo to [[Santos, S<U+00E3>o Paulo|Santos]] passing by the ABC region. <ref name="OESP19681121"> {{cite news | date = November 21, 1968 | accessdate = March 12, 2014 | newspaper = O Estado de S. Paulo | language = Portuguese | url = http://acervo.estadao.com.br/pagina/#!/19681121-28718-nac-0090-999-90-not/busca/S%C3%A3o+Paulo+metr%C3%B4 | title = Passageiros, o metro j<U+00E1> vai partir | page = 90 | trans_title = Passengers, the metro will depart | last = de Siqueira | first = Ethevaldo Mello }} </ref>

Although [[commuter rail]] services exist between the ABC region and the city of S<U+00E3>o Paulo since the end of the [[19th century]], through [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo Railway]] and its successors, the fast growing of the area observed in the 2nd half of the [[20th century]] and the unavailability of such services on some cities (notably S<U+00E3>o Bernardo do Campo and [[Diadema]]) demanded further transport options to the region. At first the government didn't see any rationale to establish a metro line in the area, choosing to install a [[trolley bus]] service linking S<U+00E3>o Paulo to S<U+00E3>o Bernardo do Campo through Diadema. <ref name="OESP19841130"> {{cite news | language = Portuguese | url = http://acervo.estadao.com.br/pagina/#!/19841130-33665-nac-0036-999-36-not/busca/Metr%C3%B4+linha+ABC | newspaper = O Estado de S.

The [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (state)|S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] secretariat of Metropolitan Transportation started to issue plans for the future transport expansion in 1997, aiming to anticipate and get prepared for the demands of its citizens on this matter. Those reports are known as Integrated Urban Transport Plans (''Plano Integrado de Transporte Urbano'' - PITU). <ref name="STM"> {{cite web | website = Metropolitan Transportation Secretary website | accessdate = March 14, 2014 | date = August 9, 2009 | title = PITU Presentations | url = http://www.stm.sp.gov.br/index.php/pitu2020-english-327 }} </ref> PITU [[2025]] claimed for the need to a metro branch linking ABC to S<U+00E3>o Paulo, more specifically employing either a [[light rail]] or [[guided bus]] technology. <ref name="PITU25"> {{cite web | website = S<U+00E3>o Paulo Secretariat of Metropolitan Transportation | language = Portuguese | title = PITU 2025 | page = 196 | url = http://www.stm.sp.gov.br/images/stories/Pitus/Pitu2025/Pdf/Pitu_2025_08.pdf | accessdate = March 17, 2014 | date = December 2006 }} </ref>

The original project predicted a 18 stops' line linking the current [[Tamanduate<U+00ED> (S<U+00E3>o Paulo Metro)|Tamanduate<U+00ED> station]] (already served by S<U+00E3>o Paulo Metro and [[CPTM]] [[commuter rail]] service as well) to Alvarengas station, a future terminal station to be located near the city road bearing the same name. <ref name="EIARIMA"> {{cite web | website = S<U+00E3>o Paulo Metro website | language = Portuguese | accessdate = March 17, 2014 | url = http://www.metro.sp.gov.br/metro/licenciamento-ambiental/pdf/linha_18_bronze/eia/volume-i/Arquivo-01.pdf | title = Estudo de Impacto Ambiental - Linha 18 | trans_title = Environmental impact assessment - Line 18 | page = 1 | date = May 15, 2012 }} </ref> However parts of such path overlaps the current S<U+00E3>o Mateus<U+2013>Jabaquara metropolitan corridor, which would demand the extinction of such service between S<U+00E3>o Bernardo and Ferraz<U+00F3>polis. As this corridor is operated through a [[Concession (contract)|concession]], it would imply breaking that [[contract]] thus exposing the state government to a [[termination fee]]. Such risk endangered the whole project <ref name="DGABC20130623"> {{cite web | website = Di<U+00E1>rio do Grande ABC website | date = June 23, 2013 | accessdate = March 17, 2014 | language = Portuguese | url = http://www.dgabc.com.br/Noticia/463876/linha-18-bronze-ate-o-alvarenga-tem-chance-de-ficar-so-no-papel?referencia=buscas-lista | title = Linha 18 - Bronze at<U+00E9> o Alvarenga tem chance de ficar s<U+00F3> no papel | trans_title = Line 18 - Bronze to Alvarenga in risk to remain as a project | last = Rocha | first = Rafael }} </ref> and the solution sought was to truncate the proposed line to end at S<U+00E3>o Bernardo station and eventually at Djalma Dutra station.

The [[government procurement]] for the establishment of the line has been established in [[2014]] and states it will be constructed as a [[public<U+2013>private partnership]]. The system is expected to be concluded in [[2018]]. <ref name="DGABC20140129"> {{cite web | website = Di<U+00E1>rio do Grande ABC website | language = portuguese | date = January 29, 2014 | accessdate = March 17, 2014 | last = Rocha | first = Raphael | title = Alckmin planeja divulgar vencedor da Linha 18 no 1<U+00BA> semestre | trans_title = Alckmin plans to announce line 18 winner up to the 1st half-year | url = http://www.dgabc.com.br/Noticia/507410/alckmin-planeja-divulgar-vencedor-da-linha-18-no-1-semestre?referencia=buscas-lista }} </ref>

==Controversy==

The monorail alternative for line 18 was contested, as it is not employed on current metro branches but appointed as the most suitable construction for this project, as well as for lines [[Line 15 (S<U+00E3>o Paulo Metro)|15]] (formerly line [[Line 2 (S<U+00E3>o Paulo Metro)|2]] expansion) and [[Line 17 (S<U+00E3>o Paulo Metro)|17]]. Positive arguments are the cheaper, faster construction and decreasing the need for [[Eminent domain|resumption]]; listed setbacks are [[visual pollution]], difficulty to be evacuated in case of emergency, its relative small capacity and incapability to be upgraded. <ref name="OESP20120319"> {{cite news | newspaper = O Estado de S.

In downtown S<U+00E3>o Bernardo do Campo, some real estate owners tried to settle a [[civil action]] to change the proposed [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]], as it may adversely affect [[high-end]] [[apartment building]]s recently erected there, through aesthetic concerns and planned resumptions. <ref name="G1"> {{cite web | website = g1.com.br | url = http://g1.globo.com/sao-paulo/noticia/2013/07/moradores-querem-acao-judicial-contra-tracado-de-monotrilho-no-abc.html | accessdate = March 17, 2014 | date = July 8, 2013 | last = Santiago | first = Tatiana | language = Portuguese | trans_title = Homeowners want civil action against ABC monorail path | title = Moradores querem a<U+00E7><U+00E3>o judicial contra tra<U+00E7>ado de monotrilho no ABC }} </ref>
