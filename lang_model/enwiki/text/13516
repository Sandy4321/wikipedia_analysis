==History==
Sanford was named for C.O. Sanford, a railroad civil engineer instrumental in the building of the rail lines through the area that formed the foundation of what became the city of Sanford.

Sanford is located in [[Lee County, North Carolina]], which was formed from parts of the surrounding three counties in 1907. On creation of the new county, both Sanford and Jonesboro were the major towns in the area. Rather than decide which would be the county seat, the decision was to place the county's new courthouse directly between the two towns. For decades, Lee County was the only county in the United States to have a courthouse with an [[rural delivery service|RFD address]]. In the late 20th century Sanford had grown to such an extent that it eventually merged with Jonesboro. The town of Jonesboro became Jonesboro Heights, and the name of Sanford was kept for the town.

The general Sanford area played key roles in the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, specifically regarding sites like the [[House in the Horseshoe]] and [[Endor Iron Furnace]].  Over the following decades, the Sanford area became an important source of coal, brownstone, and brick.  In particular brownstone and subsequent brick production made Sanford a key provider of these building materials for areas throughout the United States.<ref name="downtown">{{cite web|url=http://www.downtownsanford.com/history.htm|title=History of Downtown Sanford|publisher=Downtown Sanford, Inc.|accessdate=2008-11-06}}</ref>
