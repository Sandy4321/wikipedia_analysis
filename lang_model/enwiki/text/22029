===Foundational period===

Opus Dei was founded by a Catholic priest, [[Josemar<U+00ED>a Escriv<U+00E1> de Balaguer|Josemar<U+00ED>a Escriv<U+00E1>]], on [[2 October]] [[1928]] in [[Madrid, Spain]]. According to Escriv<U+00E1>, on that day he experienced a "vision" in which he "saw Opus Dei".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.josemariaescriva.info/index.php?id_cat=271&id_scat=270|work=JosemariaEscriva.info|title=Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/10/05/wjose05.xml&sSheet=/news/2002/10/05/ixworld.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Vatican proves the power of Opus Dei Founder | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>  He gave the organization the name "Opus Dei", which in Latin means "Work of God,"<ref name="TIME"/> in order to underscore the belief that the organization was not his (Escriv<U+00E1>'s) work, but was rather God's work.<ref name="BENEDICTONESCRIVA">{{cite web | url=http://www.opusdei.org/art.php?w=32&p=4761 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=Pope Benedict XVI on St. Josemar<U+00ED>a Escriva | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> Throughout his life, Escriv<U+00E1> held that the founding of Opus Dei had a supernatural character.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.josemariaescriva.info/index.php?id_cat=218&id_scat=35 | work=JosemariaEscriva.info | title=The Founding of Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> Escriv<U+00E1> summarized Opus Dei's mission as a way of helping ordinary Christians "to understand that their life<U+2026> is a way of holiness and evangelization... And to those who grasp this ideal of holiness, the Work offers the spiritual assistance and training they need to put it into practice."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.escrivaworks.org/book/conversations/point/60 | title=''Conversations'' 60 | first=Josemar<U+00ED>a | last=Escriv<U+00E1> | accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref> 

Initially, Opus Dei was open only to men, but in 1930, Escriv<U+00E1> created a women's branch.<ref name=Berglar/> In 1936, the organization suffered a temporary setback with the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], as many Roman Catholic priests and religious figures, including Escriv<U+00E1>, were forced into hiding. The many atrocities committed on all sides during the civil war included the murder and rape of religious figures by government loyalists.<ref name="PRESTON"/> After the civil war was won by General [[Francisco Franco]], Escriv<U+00E1> was able to return to Madrid.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.josemariaescriva.info/index.php?id_cat=293&id_scat=270 | work=JosemariaEscriva.info | title=Historical Overview | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> Escriva himself recounted that it was in Spain where Opus Dei found "the greatest difficulties" because of traditionalists who he felt misunderstood Opus Dei's ideas.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.escrivaworks.org/book/conversations/point/33| title=''Conversations'' 33| first=Josemar<U+00ED>a | last=Escriv<U+00E1> | accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref> Despite this, Opus Dei flourished during the years of the [[Spain under Franco|Franquismo]], spreading first throughout Spain, and after 1945, expanding internationally.<ref name=Berglar/> 

In 1939, Escriv<U+00E1> published ''[[The Way (book)|The Way]]'', a collection of 999 maxims concerning spirituality.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.escrivaworks.org/book/the_way | work=EscrivaWorks.org | title=The Way | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> In the 1940s, Opus Dei found an early critic in the [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus|Jesuit leader]] [[Wlodimir Ledochowski]], who told the Vatican that he considered Opus Dei "very dangerous for the Church in Spain," citing its "secretive character" and calling it "a form of Christian [[Freemasonry|Masonry]]."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.philipcoppens.com/dvc_3.html | author=Philip Copens | title=Deciphering the Da Vinci Code | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>

In 1946, Escriv<U+00E1> moved the organization's headquarters to Rome.<ref name=Berglar/> In 1950, Pope Pius XII granted definitive approval to Opus Dei, thereby allowing married people to join the organization.<ref name=Berglar/>

===Post-foundational years===
In 1975, Escriva died and was succeeded by [[<U+00C1>lvaro del Portillo]]. In 1982, Opus Dei was made into a [[personal prelature]]. This means the Opus Dei related objectives of the members fall under the direct jurisdiction of the Prelate of Opus Dei wherever they are.  As to "what the law lays down for all the ordinary faithful," the lay members of Opus Dei, being no different from other Catholics, "continue to be ... under the jurisdiction of the diocesan bishop," in the words of John Paul II's ''Ut Sit''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_781530298/Opus_Dei.html | work=MSN Encarta | title=Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>  In 1994, [[Javier Echevarria]] became Prelate upon the death of his predecessor. 

One-third of the world's bishops sent letters petitioning for the canonization of Escriv<U+00E1>.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=3720 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=Blessed Josemar<U+00ED>a Escriv<U+00E1> to be canonized | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> Escriva was beatified in 1992 in the midst of controversy prompted by questions about Escriva's suitability for sainthood.  In 2002, approximately 300,000 people gathered in St. Peter's Square on the day Pope John Paul II canonized Josemar<U+00ED>a Escriv<U+00E1>.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives/101802/101802h.htm | work=National Catholic Reporter | title=300,000 pilgrims turn out for canonization of Opus Dei founder | author=John L.

There are other members whose process of beatification has been opened: [[Ernesto Cofi<U+00F1>o]], a father of five children and a pioneer in pediatric research in Guatemala; [[Montserrat Grases]], a teenage Catalan student who died of cancer; [[List of prominent members of Opus Dei#Social work|Toni Zweifel]], a Swiss engineer; and Bishop <U+00C1>lvaro del Portillo.

During the pontificate of John Paul II, two members of Opus Dei, [[Juan Luis Cardinal Cipriani Thorne|Juan Luis Cipriani]] and [[Juli<U+00E1>n Herranz Casado|Juli<U+00E1>n Herranz]], were made [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.opusdei.org/art.php?w=32&p=6908 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=Cardinals Tauran and Herranz installed at their titular churches | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> 

In September 2005, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] blessed a newly installed statue of [[Josemaria Escriva]] placed in an outside wall niche of St Peter's Basilica, a place for founders of Catholic organizations.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cathnews.com/news/509/83.php | author=Guardian/Associated Press | title=Pope blesses statue of Opus Dei founder | accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref> 

During that same year, Opus Dei received some unwanted attention due to the extraordinary success of the novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', in which both Opus Dei and the Catholic Church itself are depicted very negatively. The film version was released globally in May 2006, further polarizing views on the organization.

{{main|Teachings of Opus Dei}}

Opus Dei is an organization of the [[Catholic Church]]. As such, it shares the [[Roman Catholic Church#Beliefs|theology of the Catholic Church]].  

Opus Dei places special emphasis on certain aspects of Catholic doctrine. A central feature of Opus Dei's theology is its focus on the lives of the ordinary Catholics who are neither priests nor monks.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.catholicity.com/mccloskey/popeandopusdei.html | work=Crisis Magazine | author=Fr. John McCloskey|date=March 1995 | title=The Pope and Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27}} ''mirrored on CatholiCity''</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.opusdei.org/art.php?w=32&p=9319 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=Opus Dei<U+2019>s focus on secular life | accessdate=2006-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nysun.com/article/30310?access=391277 | work=The New York Sun | title='Da Vinci' And Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>  Opus Dei emphasizes the "[[universal call to holiness]]": the belief that everyone should aspire to be a saint, that sanctity is within the reach of everyone, not just a few special individuals.<ref name=NPR>{{cite web | url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5029154 | work=National Public Radio | title=A Glimpse Inside a Catholic 'Force': Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>  Opus Dei does not have monks or nuns, and only a minority of its members are part of the priesthood.<ref name="CATHOLICDAVINCI">{{cite web | url=http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=19147 | work=Catholic News Service | title=Opus Dei called 'complete opposite' of 'The Da Vinci Code' portrayal | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> A related characteristic is Opus Dei's emphasis on uniting spiritual life with professional, social, and family life. Whereas the members of some religious orders might live in monasteries and devote their lives exclusively to prayer and study, members of Opus Dei lead ordinary lives, with traditional families and secular careers,<ref name="MESSAGE"/>  and strive to "sanctify ordinary life". Indeed, Pope John Paul II called Escriv<U+00E1> "the saint of ordinary life".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2006-05/2006-05-22-voa20.cfm?CFID=2829126&CFTOKEN=35170673 | work=JoseMaria.info|title=Decree of Canonization | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> 

Similarly, Opus Dei stresses the importance of work and professional competence.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.escrivaworks.org/book/furrow-chapter-15.htm

The biblical roots of this Catholic doctrine, according to the founder, are in the phrase "God created man to work" (Gen 2:15) and [[Jesus]]'s long life as an ordinary [[carpenter]] in a small town.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.escrivaworks.org/book/conversations-point-55.htm

| author=Josemar<U+00ED>a Escriv<U+00E1>|work=Friends of God | title=Working for God | accessdate=2007-07-04}}</ref>

The foundation of the Christian life, stressed Escriva, is ''[[divine filiation]]'': Christians are children of God, identified with Christ's life and mission. Other main features of Opus Dei, according to its official literature, are: ''[[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]]'', respecting choice and taking personal responsibility; and ''[[Charity (virtue)|charity]]'', love of God above all and love of others.<ref name="MESSAGE">{{cite web | url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=12224 | work=Opus Dei website | title=Message of Opus Dei | accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref>

At the bottom of Escriva's understanding of the <U+201C>universal call to holiness<U+201D> are two dimensions, subjective and objective. The subjective is the call given to each person to become a saint, regardless of his place in society. The objective refers to what Escriva calls [[Christian materialism]]: all of creation, even the most material situation, is a meeting place with God, and leads to union with Him.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.apologeticsindex.org/30-opus-dei-foundation-and-purpose | work=Apologetics index | title=Opus Dei:Foundation and Purpose | accessdate=2007-05-16}}</ref>

===Prayers===

{{seealso|Interior life (Catholic theology)}}

All members - whether married or unmarried, priests or laypeople - are trained to follow a 'plan of life', or 'the norms of piety', which are some traditional [[Catholic devotions]]. This is meant to follow the  teaching mentioned in the Catholic Catechism to "pray at specific times...to nourish continual prayer,"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p4s1c3.htm | work=Catechism of the Catholic Church no. 2697-8 | title=The Life of Prayer | accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref> which in turn is based on [[Jesus]]' "pray always" (Lk 18:1), echoed by St. Paul's "pray without ceasing" (1 Thes 5:17). According to Escriva, the vocation to Opus Dei is a calling to be a "contemplative in the middle of the world," who converts work and daily life into prayer. 

''Daily norms:''
*[[Waking up early|Heroic minute]], waking up punctually and saying "[[Serviam]]!" (Latin: I will serve) 
*[[Morning offering]], fixing one's intentions to do everything for the glory of God
*[[Spiritual reading]] and reading the [[New Testament]], a practice recommended by [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] and other saints
*[[Mental prayer]], conversation with God 
*[[Mass]],  [[Eucharist|Communion]] and [[Thanksgiving after Communion]]
*[[Rosary]], a traditional Catholic prayer to the Virgin Mary,
*[[Preces (Opus Dei)|The Preces]] (the common prayer of Opus Dei)
*[[Angelus]] prayer which recalls Christian belief in God's becoming man, said at noon
*[[Memorare]] prayer to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] offered for the Opus Dei member in most need at that exact moment
*[[Visit to the Blessed Sacrament]], a Catholic practice of greeting Jesus in the Eucharist
*[[Examination of conscience]] at the end of the day: 
*[[Three Hail Marys]] before bed to pray for the virtue of [[purity]]
*Short, spontaneous prayers throughout the day, offering up to God one's work, sufferings etc.

''Weekly norms:''
*[[Confession]], in pursuit of the Catholic recommendation on [[frequent confession]]
*a group meeting of spiritual formation ("the Circle")
*the praying of a [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Marian]] [[antiphon]] on Saturdays
*taking [[Psalm]] 2 as the basis of mental prayer on Tuesdays

Additionally, members should participate yearly in a spiritual [[retreat]]; a three-week seminar every year is obligatory for numeraries, and a one-week seminar for supernumeraries.  Also members are expected to make a day-trip pilgrimage where they recite 3 5-decade rosaries on the month of May in honor of Mary.

===Mortification===
{{seealso|Mortification}}

[[Image:Cilice3.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Closeup of a [[cilice]]-- a small metal chain with inwardly-pointing spikes]] 

Much public attention has focused on Opus Dei's practice of [[mortification]] &mdash; the voluntary offering up of discomfort or pain to God. Mortification has a long history in many world religions, including the Catholic Church. It has been endorsed by Popes as a way of following Christ who died in a bloody [[crucifixion]] and who gave this advice: "let him deny himself, take up his cross daily and follow me." (Lk 9:23)<ref name="OFFICIALDAVINCI">{{cite web | url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=7017|work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=The Da Vinci Code, the Catholic Church and Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> Supporters say that opposition to mortification is rooted in having lost (1) the "sense of the enormity of [[sin]]" or offense against [[God]], and the consequent [[penance]], both interior and exterior, (2) the notions of "[[Human_nature#State_of_nature|wounded human nature]]" and of [[concupiscence]] or inclination to sin, and thus the need for "spiritual battle,"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p7.htm | work=Catechism of the Catholic Church no. 405 | title=The consequences of Adam's sin for humanity | accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref> and (3) a spirit of [[sacrifice]] for love and "supernatural ends," and not only for physical enhancement. 

As a spirituality for ordinary people, Opus Dei focuses on performing sacrifices pertaining to normal duties and to its emphasis on charity and cheerfulness.

===Governance===

{{main|Personal prelature}}
[[Image:Bishopjechevarria.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Monsignor [[Javier Echevarria Rodriguez|Javier Echevarria]], the current Prelate of Opus Dei]]
In Pope John Paul II's 1982 decree known as the [[Apostolic constitution]] ''Ut Sit'',  Opus Dei was established as a personal prelature, an official structure of the [[Catholic Church]] like a [[diocese]] which contains lay people and secular priests who are led by a bishop. In addition to being governed by ''Ut Sit'' and by the Catholic Church's general law, Opus Dei is governed by the Vatican's Particular Law concerning Opus Dei, otherwise known as Opus Dei's statutes. This  specifies the objectives and workings of the prelature. The prelature is under the [[Congregation for Bishops]].<ref name="UTSIT">{{cite web | url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CBISUTSI.HTM|author=Pope John Paul II | title=Apostolic Constitution ''Ut Sit'', Establishing Opus Dei as the first Personal Prelature of the Catholic Church | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref><ref name="PLACE">{{cite web | url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=10877 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=Place in the Church | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>   

The head of the Opus Dei prelature is known as the Prelate.<ref name="UTSIT"/>  The Prelate is the primary governing authority and is assisted by two councils &mdash; the General Council (made up of men) and the Central Advisory (made up of women).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.odan.org/tw_government_in_od.htm | author=Dennis Dubro | title=Government, Direction and Control in Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=13018 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=What is Opus Dei - Governance | accessdate=2006-11-28}}</ref>  The Prelate holds his position for life.

Opus Dei's highest assembled bodies are the General Congresses, which are usually convened once every eight years.  There are separate congresses for the men and women's branch of Opus Dei.  The General Congresses are made up of members appointed by the Prelate, and are responsible for advising him about the prelature's future.  The men's General Congress also elects the Prelate, after consultation with their female counterpart.<ref name="82STATUTES">{{cite web | url=http://www.odan.org/Statutes_OD_1982.RTF | work=Opus Dei | title=1982 Statutes of Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27}}''mirrored on Odan.org''.

===Membership===
{{main|Types of membership of Opus Dei}}

Opus Dei has about 87,000 members in more than 80 different countries.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1434918,00.html | work=Times Online | author=Ruth Gledhill | title=Controversial Catholic group is given care of parish church | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>  About 60% of Opus Dei members reside in Europe, and 35% reside in the Americas.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=26013 | work=[[Zenit News Agency]] | title=Opus Dei: Its Mission, Structure and Members | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> For the most part, Opus Dei members belong to the middle-to-low levels in society, in terms of education, income, and social status.<ref name="MESSORI"/>  

Opus Dei is made up of several different types of membership:<ref name="BBC_RandE"/>

'''[[Supernumerary|Supernumeraries]]''', the largest type, currently account for about 70% of the total membership.<ref name="TRIBUNE">{{cite web | url=http://www.rickross.com/reference/opus/opus41.html | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Catholics scrutinize enigmatic Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27}} ''mirrored on RickRoss.com''</ref>  Typically, supernumeraries are married men and women with careers.  Supernumeraries devote a portion of their day to prayer, in addition to attending regular meetings and taking part in activities such as retreats.  Due to their career and family obligations, supernumeraries are not as available to the organization as the other types of members, but they typically contribute financially to Opus Dei, and they lend other types of assistance as their circumstances permit.  

'''[[Numerary|Numeraries]]''', the second largest type of members of Opus Dei, comprise about 20% of total membership.<ref name="TRIBUNE"/>  Numeraries are celibate members who usually live in special centers run by Opus Dei.  Both men and women may become numeraries, although the centers are strictly gender-segregated.<ref name=conservative>{{cite web | url=http://www.population-security.org/cffc-97-01.htm
| work=Center for Research on Population and Security | title=Conservative Catholic Influence in Europe | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>  Numeraries generally have careers and devote the bulk of their income to the organization.<ref name="AMERICA">{{cite web | url=http://www.americamagazine.org/content/articles/martin-opusdei.cfm | work=America: The National Catholic Weekly | title=Opus Dei In the United States | author=James Martin, S.J. | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>

'''[[Types of membership of Opus Dei|Numerary assistants]]''' are unmarried, celibate female members of Opus Dei.  They live in special centers run by Opus Dei but do not have jobs outside the centers &mdash; instead, their professional life is dedicated to looking after the domestic needs of the centers and their residents.  

'''[[Types of membership of Opus Dei|Associates]]''' are unmarried, celibate members who typically have family or professional obligations.<ref name="AMERICA"/>  Unlike numeraries and numerary assistants, the associates do not live in Opus Dei centers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cephas-library.com/catholic_opus_die.html | work=Cephas Library|title=Opus Dei |accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>

The '''[[Types of membership of Opus Dei|Clergy of the Opus Dei Prelature]]''' are priests who are under the jurisdiction of the Prelate of Opus Dei.  They are a minority in Opus Dei&mdash; only about 2% of Opus Dei members are part of the clergy.<ref name="TRIBUNE"/>  Typically, they are numeraries or associates who ultimately joined the priesthood.       

The '''[[Opus Dei: Priestly Society of the Holy Cross|Priestly Society of the Holy Cross]]''' consists of priests associated with Opus Dei.  Part of the society is made up of the clergy of the Opus Dei prelature &mdash; members of the priesthood who fall under the jurisdiction of the Opus Dei prelature are automatically members of the Priestly Society.  Other members in the society are diocesan priests &mdash; clergymen who remain under the jurisdiction of a geographically-defined diocese. These priests are considered members of Opus Dei who are given its spiritual training. They do not however report to the Opus Dei Prelate but to their own diocesan bishop.<ref name=ODinChurch>{{cite book |author= Pedro Rodriguez, Fernando Ocariz, Jose Luis Illanes | title=Opus Dei in the Church|publisher=Scepter |date=2003}}</ref>

The [[Types of membership of Opus Dei|Cooperators of Opus Dei]] are non-members who collaborate in some way with Opus Dei &mdash; usually through praying, charitable contributions, or by providing some other assistance.  Cooperators are not required to be celibate or to adhere to any other special requirements.  Indeed, cooperators are not even required to be Christian.<ref name=ODinChurch/>

In accordance with Catholic theology, membership is granted when a [[vocation]], or divine calling is presumed to have occurred.

===Activities===
{{main|Opus Dei in society}}
Leaders of Opus Dei describe the organization as a teaching entity, whose main activity is to train Catholics to assume personal responsibility in sanctifying the secular world from within.<ref>or a "great catechesis" {{cite web | url=http://www.josemariaescriva.info/index.php?id_cat=229&id_scat=35&modeprint=active | work=JosemariaEscriva.info | title=Catechetical Trips | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref><ref name="TIME">{{cite news | author = David Van Biema | title = The Ways of Opus Dei | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1184078,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = [[April 19]], [[2006]] | accessdate = 2007-03-24}}</ref>  This teaching is done by means of theory and practice.<ref>{{cite web| title =Opus Dei Celebrates 25th Anniversary of Status: Church Leaders Reflect on 1st Personal Prelature | url=http://www.zenit.org/article-22047?l=english | work =Zenit News Agency| date =2008-03-13 | accessdate = 2008-03-20}}</ref> 

Its lay people and priests organize seminars, workshops, retreats, and classes to help people put the Christian faith into practice in their daily lives. [[Spiritual direction]], one-on-one coaching with a more experienced lay person or priest, is considered the "paramount means" of training. Through these activities they provide religious instruction (doctrinal formation), coaching in spirituality for lay people (spiritual formation), character and moral education (human formation), lessons in sanctifying one's work (professional formation), and know-how in evangelizing one's family and workplace (apostolic formation).

The official Catholic document which established the prelature states that Opus Dei strives "to put into practice the teaching of the universal call to sanctity, and to promote at all levels of society the sanctification of ordinary work, and by means of ordinary work." <ref name="UTSIT"/> Thus, the founder and his followers describe members of Opus Dei as resembling the members of the early Christian Church &mdash; ordinary workers who seriously sought holiness with nothing exterior to distinguish them from other citizens.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lukeraid.tripod.com/opusdei/id19.html | work=Opus Dei : A Dialogue Between Friend and Foe | title=St. Liguori et Als on vocation and Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref><ref name="TIME"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://en.romana.org/?s=8.0&n=29&ID=1 | work=Romana: The Official Bulletin of Opus Dei | title=The Example of the Early Christians in Blessed Josemaria's Teachings | author=Domingo Ramos-Liss<U+00F3>n | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>  

Opus Dei runs residential centers throughout the world. These centers provide residential housing for celibate members, undertake recruitment, and provide doctrinal and theological education.

==Relations with Catholic leaders==
{{main|Opus Dei and Catholic Church leaders}}

The bishop of Madrid where Opus Dei was born, Leopoldo Eijo y Garay, supported Opus Dei and defended it in the 1940s by saying that "this ''opus'' is truly ''Dei''" (this work is truly God's). Contrary to attacks of secrecy and heresy, the bishop described Opus Dei's founder as someone who is "open as a child" and "most obedient to the Church hierarchy."<ref>V<U+00E1>zquez de Prada, Andr<U+00E9>s, ''The Founder of Opus Dei: The life of Josemar<U+00ED>a Escriv<U+00E1>, Volume 1: The early years,'' New York, 2000.</ref>  

In 1960, [[Pope John XXIII]] commented that Opus Dei opens up "unsuspected horizons of [[wiktionary:apostolate|apostolate]]".<ref name="OFFICIAL_PAPAL"/>  Furthermore, in 1964, [[Pope Paul VI]] praised the organization in a handwritten letter to Escriv<U+00E1>, saying:

:''Opus Dei is "a vigorous expression of the perennial youth of the Church, fully open to the demands of a modern apostolate... We look with paternal satisfaction on all that Opus Dei has achieved and is achieving for the kingdom of God, the desire of doing good that guides it, the burning love for the Church and its visible head that distinguishes it, and the ardent zeal for souls that impels it along the arduous and difficult paths of the apostolate of presence and witness in every sector of contemporary life."''<ref name="OFFICIAL_PAPAL"/>

The relationship between Paul VI and Opus Dei, according to Alberto Moncada, a doctor of sociology and ex-member, was "stormy".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.takingfive.com/ethics_opusdei.htm | work=TakingFive.com | author=Ruth Bertels | title=The Ethics of Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> After the [[Second Vatican Council]] concluded in 1965, Pope Paul VI denied Opus Dei's petition to become a personal prelature, Moncada stated.<ref name= "OpusOverTime"/>

[[Pope John Paul I]], a few years before his election, wrote that Escriv<U+00E1> was more radical than other saints who taught about the [[universal call to holiness]]. While others emphasized monastic spirituality applied to lay people, for Escriv<U+00E1> "it is the material work itself which must be turned into prayer and sanctity", thus providing a lay spirituality.<ref name=Luciani>{{cite web | url=http://gabriel.mps.ohio-state.edu/od/opus.see |author=Cardinal Albino Luciani (John Paul I)| work=Opus Dei Files| title=Seeking God Through Everyday Work: A profile of the Founder of Opus Dei, Josemaria Escriva| accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref>

One-third of the world's [[bishop]]s petitioned for the [[Canonization of Josemar<U+00ED>a Escriv<U+00E1>|canonization of Escriv<U+00E1>]]. During the canonization, there were 42 [[cardinal]]s and 470 bishops from around the world, [[general superior]]s of many [[religious order|orders]] and [[Congregation (catholic)|religious congregations]], and representatives of various Catholic groups. During those days, these Church officials commented on the universal reach and validity of the message of the founder.<ref name="MESSORI">{{cite book | author=Messori, Vittorio| title=Opus Dei, Leadership and Vision in Today's Catholic Church | publisher=Regnery Publishing | year=1997 | id=ISBN 0-89526-450-1}}</ref> With teachings of the man he canonized, John Paul II said "it is easier to understand what the Second Vatican Council affirmed: 'there is no question, then, of the Christian message inhibiting men from building up the world ... on the contrary it is an incentive to do these very things' (Vatican II, ''[[Gaudium et spes]],'' n. 34)."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/2002/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20021006_escriva_en.html| work=Vatican Official site| title=Canonization of St. Josemaria Escriva: Homily of John Paul II| accessdate=2008-03-20}}</ref> 

Concerning the groups's role in the Catholic Church, critics have argued that Opus Dei's unique status as a personal prelature gives it too much independence, making it essentially a "church within a church" and that Opus Dei exerts a disproportionately large influence within the Catholic Church itself,<ref name=Walsh/> as illustrated, for example, by the unusually rapid [[Josemar<U+00ED>a Escriv<U+00E1>: Canonisation|canonization of Escriv<U+00E1>]], which some considered to be irregular.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2005/0510.baumann.html | work=Washington Monthly | title=Let There Be Light: A look inside the hidden world of Opus Dei | author=Paul Baumann | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> In contrast, Catholic officials say that church authorities have even greater control of Opus Dei now that its head is a prelate appointed by the Pope,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=20829 | work=Opus Dei website | author=Francesco Monterisi | title=The Personal Prelature: a Framework which Enriches the Communion of the Church | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref> and its status as a prelature "precisely means dependence."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://zenit.org/article-22167?l=english| work=Zenit News Agency | author=Miriam D<U+00ED>ez i Bosch| title=Opus Dei Opens its Doors to Everyone: Interview With the Vicar General of the Personal Prelature| accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref>  Allen says that Escriva's relatively quick canonization does not have anything to do with power but with improvements in procedures and John Paul II's decision to make Escriva's sanctity and message known.<ref name="ALLENBOOK"/> 

The current pope, [[Benedict XVI]], is also a particularly strong supporter of Opus Dei and of Escriv<U+00E1>.  Pointing to the name "Work of God", Benedict XVI (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger), wrote that "The Lord simply made use of [Escriv<U+00E1>] who allowed God to work." Ratzinger cited Escriv<U+00E1> for correcting the mistaken idea that holiness is reserved to some extraordinary people who are completely different from ordinary sinners: Even if he can be very weak, with many mistakes in his life, a saint is nothing other than to speak with God as a friend speaks with a friend, allowing God to work, the Only One who can really make the world both good and happy. 

Ratzinger spoke of Opus Dei's "surprising union of absolute fidelity to the Church<U+2019>s great tradition, to its faith, and unconditional openness to all the challenges of this world, whether in the academic world, in the field of work, or in matters of the economy, etc."<ref name="BENEDICTONESCRIVA"/>  He further explained:

:''"the theocentrism of Escriv<U+00E1>...means this confidence in the fact that God is working now and we ought only to put ourselves at his disposal...This, for me, is a message of greatest importance. It is a message that leads to overcoming what could be considered the great temptation of our times: the pretense that after the '[[Big Bang]]' God retired from history."''<ref name="BENEDICTONESCRIVA"/>

==Controversy==
{{Main|Controversies about Opus Dei}}

Throughout its history Opus Dei has been criticized from many quarters, leading journalists to describe Opus Dei as "the most controversial force in the Catholic Church" and Escriv<U+00E1> as a "polarizing" figure.<ref name="ALLENBOOK"/><ref name=Noam/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Feb2006/books.asp

Aside from the issues related to the Catholic church, specially the practice of [[mortification of the flesh]],  controversies about Opus Dei have centered around criticisms of its alleged secretiveness, its recruiting methods, the rules governing members, alleged elitism, and the right-leaning politics of its members and their alleged participation in extreme right-wing governments, especially the [[Spain under Franco|Francoist]] Government of Spain until 1978.<ref name="OpusOverTime">{{cite web |url=http://icsahome.com/infoserv_articles/moncada_alberto_opusdei_en0502.htm |title=Opus Dei Over Time | author=Alberto Moncada PhD | year=2006 | accessdate=2007-11-24}} </ref>

Allen, Messori, and Plunkett also state that accusations that Opus Dei is secretive are unfounded and stem from a [[clericalism|clerical paradigm]] whereby Opus Dei members are expected to behave as monks and clerics (the traditional models for sanctity) who are externally identifiable as such. In contrast, he continues, its lay members, like any normal Catholic professional, are ultimately responsible for their personal actions, and do not externally represent the organization which provides them religious education. Allen states that Opus Dei provides abundant information about itself. These journalists have stated that the historic roots of criticisms against Opus Dei can be found in influential clerical circles.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theamericanmag.com/article.php?show_issue_id=24&show_article_id=320

===Critical views===
In the English-speaking world, the most vocal critic of Opus Dei is a group called the ''[[Opus Dei Awareness Network]]'' (ODAN), a non-profit organization that exists "to provide education, outreach and support to people who have been adversely affected by Opus Dei." ODAN is headed by Diane DiNicola, mother of a former member, Tammy DiNicola. <ref name="ODAN">{{cite web | url=http://www.odan.org/ | work=ODAN.org | title=The Opus Dei Awareness Network (ODAN) | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> Other major critics are Maria Carmen del Tapia, an ex-member who was a high-ranking officer of Opus Dei for many years,<ref>{{cite book | author=Maria del Carmen Tapia | title=Beyond the Threshold: A Life in Opus Dei | publisher=Continuum Publishing Company | year=1997 | id=ISBN 0826410960}}</ref> liberal Catholic theologians such as Fr.

Critics state that Opus Dei is "intensely secretive"&mdash; for example, members generally do not disclose their affiliation with Opus Dei in public, and under the 1950 constitution, members were expressly forbidden to reveal themselves without the permission of their superiors.<ref name="TIME"/> This practice has led to much speculation about who may be a member.<ref name="TIME"/>  Opus Dei has been accused of deceptive and aggressive recruitment practices such as showering potential members with intense praise ("[[Love bombing]]"),<ref name="DAILYRECORD">{{cite web | url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/14640/opus-dei-members-da-vinci-distorted | work=Daily Record | title=Opus Dei members: 'Da Vinci' distorted | author=Abbott Karloff|date=May 14, 2006 | accessdate=2006-11-27}} ''mirrored on ReligionNewsBlog.com''</ref><!--<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.odan.org/tw_opus_dei_survival_kit.htm | work=Opus Dei Awareness Network | title=The Opus Dei Survival Kit | author=Dimitri Knobbe | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=347479 | title=Opening the doors of Opus Dei: Part 2

Organisations such as ODAN further allege that Opus Dei maintains an extremely high degree of control over its members&mdash; for instance, there used to be a time when numeraries submitted their incoming and outgoing mail to their superiors to read,<ref name="FACTFICTION">{{cite web | url=http://www.odan.org/media_fact_fiction_article.htm | work=Newsday | title=Fact, Fiction And Opus Dei | author=Paul Moses | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> and members are forbidden to read certain books without permission from their superiors.<ref name="FACTFICTION"/>  Critics charge that Opus Dei pressures numeraries to sever contact with non-members, including their own families.<ref name="DAILYRECORD"/> Thus, David Clark, who assists people to leave what he calls cults, say that Opus Dei is "very cult-like".<ref name="DAILYRECORD"/>

Critics assert that Escriv<U+00E1> and the organization supported the governments of [[Augusto Pinochet]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.odan.org/media_princeton_catholics.htm | work=The Trenton Times | author=Deborah Kovach | title=Princeton Catholic Divided | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> and [[Alberto Fujimori]] of Peru during the 1990's<ref>Allen, John, Jr. ''Opus Dei, The Truth about its Rituals, Secrets and Power'', 2005, Penguin Books, ISBN0-141-02465-8, pp 287-290</ref>, both of which allegedly included members of Opus Dei amongst their ministers and prominent supporters.

Based on his critical study of Opus Dei, [[John Allen, Jr.]] recommended that Opus Dei should (1) be more transparent, (2) collaborate with monks and nuns who belong to [[religious order]]s, and (3) its members should air out in public their criticism of the institution.

Sociologists [[Peter Berger]] and [[Samuel Huntington]] suggest that Opus Dei is involved in "a deliberate attempt to construct an alternative modernity," one that engages modern culture while at the same time is resolutely loyal to Catholic traditions.<ref name=berger>{{cite book| title=Many Globalizations: Cultural Diversity in the Contemporary World | author=Peter Berger and Samuel Huntington| publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2002}}</ref> Van Biema of ''Time Magazine'' emphasises Opus Dei's hispanic roots as a source of misunderstandings in the Anglo-Saxon world, and suggests that as the United States become more hispanicized, controversies about Opus Dei (and similar Catholic organizations) will decrease.<ref name="TIME"/>

In her 2006 book on Opus Dei, [[Maggy Whitehouse]], a non-Catholic journalist, argues that the relative autonomy of each director and center has resulted in mistakes at the local level. She recommends greater consistency and transparency for Opus Dei, which she sees as having learned the lesson of greater openness when it faced the issues raised by ''The Da Vinci Code'' and other critics.<ref name="whitehouse"/>

==Opus Dei in popular culture==

[[Image:DaVinciCode US.png|thumb|left|100px]]

In the 1997 novel ''The Genesis Code'' by [[John Case (novelist)|John Case]], the leader of Opus Dei is portrayed as the novel's [[antagonist]].  In the novel, Opus Dei members are sent on a mission to execute children who were conceived using genetically engineered [[oocyte|oocytes]].

Since 2003, Opus Dei has received world attention as a result of Dan Brown's novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and the 2006 [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|film based on the novel]]. In ''The Da Vinci Code'', Opus Dei is portrayed as a Catholic organization that is led into a sinister international conspiracy.<ref name="NCRDAVINCI">{{cite web | url=http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2004c/091004/091004p.php|work=National Catholic Reporter | title=Opus Dei and The Da Vinci Code | author=Nicole Zarayn | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>

In general, ''The Da Vinci Code'' has been sharply criticized for its numerous factual inaccuracies, and its conspiracy theory has been debunked by a wide array of scholars and historians.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/2003/03/27/da_vinci/index.html | title=The Da Vinci Code" by Dan Brown | author=Charles Taylor |date=2003-02-27 | work=Salon.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Ehrman | first=Bart | title=Truth and Fiction in The Da Vinci Code: A Historian Reveals What We Really Know about Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and Constantine | id=ISBN 978-0195181401 | publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |date=2004-11-01}}</ref> According to the Bishop of Durham, the [[N.

A [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian comic book]] (''bande dessin<U+00E9>e'') on the life of Escriva was published by Coccinelle BD in 2005. The title is ''Through the mountains'', in reference to Escriva's escape from the Republican zone through the mountains of [[Andorra]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.universbd.com/spip.php?breve1299 | work=Univers BD:

The 2007 movie ''[[Breach (film)|Breach]]'' details the capture of the spy [[Robert Hanssen]].  ''Breach'' briefly includes dialog that refers to Hanssen trying to recruit his assistant's wife into Opus Dei.  In the movie, Hanssen is portrayed as a devout Catholic who attends traditional Latin masses.

A film on the life story of the founder Josemaria Escriva and the history of the organization was announced by the Italian production company Lux Vide in February 2007. Possible stars to play the role of Escriva are [[Robert de Niro]], [[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Antonio Banderas]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.sawf.org/Entertainment/33575.aspx| work=Sawf News| title=De Niro touted as possible star of 'anti-Da Vinci Code' film |date=2007-12-31}}</ref>
