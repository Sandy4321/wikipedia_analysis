'''Etowah Indian Mounds''' is a {{convert|54|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[archaeological site]] in [[Bartow County, Georgia]] south of [[Cartersville, Georgia|Cartersville]], in the [[United States]].  Built and occupied in three phases, from 1000<U+2013>1550 [[Common Era|CE]], the prehistoric site is located on the north shore of the [[Etowah River]].  Etowah Indian Mounds Historic Site is a designated [[National Historic Landmark]], managed by the [[Georgia Department of Natural Resources]]. It is the most intact [[Mississippian culture]] site in the Southeastern United States. 


==History==
The community was inhabited from about 1000<U+2013>1550 CE by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the [[Mississippian culture]]. The town was occupied in three distinct [[archaeological phase]]s: ca. 1000<U+2013>1200 CE, ca. 1250<U+2013>1375 CE, and ca. 1375<U+2013>1550 CE. It was at its peak roughly from 1325<U+2013>1375 CE.<ref name="archaeology.org">[http://www.archaeology.org/0811/abstracts/etowah.html Mike Toner, "City Beneath the Mounds: Mapping a prehistoric American metropolis"], ''Archeology'' Magazine, Vol. 61 Number 6, November/December 2008, accessed 27 Jul 2010</ref>

Late 20th century studies showed the mounds were built and occupied by prehistoric [[indigenous peoples]] of the [[Mississippian culture]] of eastern North America. They were ancestors of the historic [[Muskogean language]]-speaking [[Muscogee (Creek)]] people of the area.<ref>[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/C/CR006.html Theodore Isham and Blue Clark, "Creek (Mvskoke)"], Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture'', accessed 27 Jul 2010</ref> ''Etowah'' is a Muskogee word derived from ''italwa'' meaning "town". The federally recognized [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation]] and [[Poarch Band of Creek Indians]] consider ''Etalwa'' to be their most important ancestral town.

In the 19th century, the mounds were mistakenly believed to be built by the [[Cherokee]], who occupied the region; however, the [[Iroquoian language|Iroquian]]-speaking tribe did not reach this part of Georgia until the late 18th century and could not have built the mounds.

==Site description==
Etowah has three main [[platform mound]] and three lesser [[mound]]s.  The Temple Mound, Mound A, is {{convert|63|ft|m}} high, taller than a six-story building, and covers {{convert|3|acre|m2}} at its base.  Ground mapping with magnetometers from 2005<U+2013>2008 revealed new information and data showing that the site was much more complex than had previously been believed. The study team has identified a total of 140 buildings on the site.  In addition, Mound A was found to have four major structures and a courtyard at the height of the community's power.<ref name="archaeology.org"/>  Mound B is {{convert|25|ft|m}} high; Mound C, which rises {{convert|10|ft|m}}, is the only one that has been completely excavated. [[Magnetometers]] enabled archaeologists to determine the location of temples of log and thatch, which were originally built on top of the mounds. Adjacent to the mounds is a raised ceremonial plaza, which was used for ceremonies, [[History of Lacrosse|stickball]] and [[chunkey]] games, and as a bazaar for trade goods.

When visiting the Etowah Mounds, guests can view the "borrow pits" (that archeologists at one time thought were moats) which were dug out to create the three large mounds in the center of the park.

Older [[pottery]] found on the site suggest that there was an earlier village (ca. 200 BCE<U+2013>600 CE) associated with the [[Swift Creek culture]]. This earlier Middle [[Woodland period]] occupation at Etowah may have been related to the major Swift Creek center of [[Leake Mounds]], approximately two miles downstream (west) of Etowah.

War was commonplace; many archaeologists believe the people of Etowah battled for hegemony over the [[Alabama river]] basin with those of [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]], a Mississippian site in present-day [[Alabama]]. The town was protected by a sophisticated semicircular [[fortification]] system. An outer band formed by nut tree orchards prevented enemy armies from shooting masses of flaming arrows into the town.  A {{convert|9|ft|m}} to {{convert|10|ft|m}} deep [[moat]] blocked direct contact by the enemy with the [[palisade]]d walls.  It also functioned as a [[drainage]] system during major floods, common for centuries, from this period and into the 20th century. Workers formed the palisade by setting upright {{convert|12|ft|m}} high logs into a ditch approximately {{convert|12|in|mm}} on center and then back-filling around the timbers to form a levee. Guard towers for archers were spaced approximately {{convert|80|ft|m}} apart.

===Artifacts===
The [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] discovered in burials within the Etowah site indicate that its residents developed an artistically and technically advanced culture.  Numerous [[copper]] tools, [[weapon]]s and ornamental plates accompanied the burials of members of Etowah's elite class.  Where proximity to copper protected the fibers from degeneration, archaeologists also found brightly colored cloth with ornate patterns. These were the remnants of the clothing of social [[elite]]s.  



Numerous clay figurines and ten [[Mississippian stone statuary|Mississippian stone statues]] have been found through the years in the vicinity of Etowah.  Many are paired statues, which portray a man sitting cross-legged and a woman kneeling. The female figures wear wrap-around skirts and males are usually portrayed without visible clothing, although both usually have elaborate hairstyles. The pair are thought to represent lineage ancestors. Individual statues of young women also show them kneeling, but with additional characteristics such as visible sex organs, with are not visible on the paired statues. This figure is thought to represent a fertility or Earth Mother goddess.<ref name=TENNCUMBSTONESTAT>{{Cite book|title=Speaking with the Ancestors-Mississippian Stone Statuary of the Tennessee-Cumberland region|author=Kevin E.

===Trade===
The [[Etowah River]] is a tributary of the [[Coosa River|Coosa]] and [[Alabama River|Alabama]] rivers, and forms the border between the southern edge of the [[Ridge and Valley Appalachians]] and the [[Piedmont Plateau]]. Trade and tribute brought [[busycon|whelk]] shells from the [[Gulf of Mexico]]; copper, [[mica]] and [[flint]] from the [[Cumberland Plateau]]; and "[[galena]], [[graphite]], and an array of [[ochre|ocher]]s to provide pigment for painting buildings, bodies, and works of art; [[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] and [[marble]] to furnish raw material for tools, weapons and ritual objects" from the [[Piedmont Plateau|Piedmont]].<ref>George E. Stuart, "Etowah: A Southeastern village in 1491," ''National Geographic'', Vol. 180 No. 4, October 1981</ref> The [[loam]]y riverbed soil could be easily tilled with digging sticks and stone and shell hoes. Its fertility was annually renewed by the river's floods.  Free of frost most of the year, the land yielded rich harvests of corn, beans, and squash. 

===Habitat===
[[American chestnut|Chestnut]], [[walnut]], [[hickory]], and [[persimmon]] trees that grew in upland forests provided nuts and fruit for both the people of Etowah and the [[white-tailed deer]], [[wild turkey]], and smaller game they hunted. Other plants that were gathered include [[stinging nettle]], [[paper mulberry]], and a [[Yaupon holly|native holly]] whose leaves and stems were brewed into the [[Black drink]] imbibed in ritual purification ceremonies. [[River cane]] grew in dense thickets and was made into arrow shafts, thatching for roofs, splits for baskets, benches, and mats for walls and floors. 

River shoals abounded in [[freshwater mussel]]s and [[turtles]].  The Mississippians built v-shaped rock [[weir]]s to pen and channel [[catfish]], [[drum (fish)|drum]] and [[gar]], which they caught in [[rivercane]] baskets.<ref>[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/E9-6507.htm "Notice of Inventory Completion: Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Atlanta, GA."] ''National Park Service.'' 2 March 2009 (retrieved 16 Sept 2010)</ref> Researchers have found remains of more than 100 rock weirs along the Etowah River.  One has been restored within the grounds of the historic site.<ref>"Etowah Indian Mounds State Park", Informational Guide, Georgia Department of Natural Resources</ref>

==Post-contact==
[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] research on the subject is not conclusive, but the Etowah site may be the same as a village of a similar name visited by [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]] [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] in 1540. The chroniclers of the de Soto Expedition made no mention of any large mounds in their record of visiting a town named ''Itaba''.  ''Itaba'' means "boundary" or trail crossing in the [[Alabama language]].  The origin of the English name for the mounds, ''Etowah'', is an archaic Muscogee place name, ''Etalwa''. ''Etalwa'' probably referred to the [[solar cross]] symbol originally. In Modern Muskogee it means a "mother town."<ref>need citation</ref>

Until studies of the late 20th century were publicized, most Georgians believed Etowah to have been built by the well-known historic Cherokee. But, the Cherokee did not arrive in this part of Georgia until the late 18th century, two to seven centuries after the mounds' construction. Scholars have evaluated sufficient evidence to determine the mound complex was unquestionably built and occupied by peoples more closely related to the Muskogean-speaking Creeks.  
[[Image:Chromesun etowah01.jpg<U+200E>|thumb|225px|The Etowah Site]]

Both the Muscogee (Creek) Nation and Poarch Band of Creek Indians consider ''Etalwa'' to be their most important ancestral town. Related to this, the official title of the Creek Nation's Principal Chief is ''Etalwa Mikko'', from this source (the Creek word for chief is ''miko'').  A new, large-scale model of Etalwa is on permanent display in the rotunda of the Muskogee (Creek) Capitol in [[Okmulgee, Oklahoma]].

==History of excavation and studies==
Missionary [[Elias Cornelius]] visited the site in 1817 and described it in his journal published by  [[Bela Bates Edwards]] in 1833. He realized a mound must have been over two hundred years old, due to the size of trees growing on it, but had little idea of its real history.<ref>{{cite book |title= Memoir of the Rev. Elias Cornelius |author= [[Bela Bates Edwards]] |year= 1842 |origyear= 1833 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=zz4AAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP84 |pages=80<U+2013>85 |publisher= Perkins & Marvin |location= Boston }}</ref>
[[Cyrus Thomas]] and [[John P. Rogan]] tested the site for the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1883. But, the first well-documented archaeological inquiry at the site did not begin until the winter of 1925, conducted by [[Warren K. Moorehead]].  His excavations into Mound C at the site revealed a rich array of [[Mississippian culture]] burial goods.  These artifacts, along with the collections from [[Cahokia]], [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville Site]], [[Lake Jackson (Tallahassee, Florida)|Lake Jackson (Florida)]], and [[Spiro Mounds]], would comprise the majority of the materials which archeologists used to define the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]] (SECC).  The professional excavation of this enormous burial mound contributed major research impetus to the study of Mississippian artifacts and peoples.  It greatly increased the understanding of pre-Contact [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] artwork.

In 1947, the government built the [[Lake Allatoona|Allatoona Dam]] upstream for flood control. The Etowah site was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1964.

The Etowah Indian Mounds museum displays artifacts found at the site, including [[Mississippian culture pottery]], monolithic stone axes, [[Mississippian stone statuary]], copper jewelry, [[shell gorget]]s, and other artifacts.
