'''Brand New''' is an American [[alternative rock]] band from [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]], [[New York]]. Formed in 2000, the band currently consists of lead vocalist and guitarist [[Jesse Lacey]], guitarist Vincent Accardi, guitarist and keyboardist Derrick Sherman, bassist Garrett Tierney and drummer Brian Lane.<ref name="bandbio">{{cite web |url = http://www.fightoffyourdemons.com/bio.html |title = Brand New Biography |accessdate = 2006-02-18 |year = 2006 |publisher = Brand New - Official website}}</ref> 

In the late 1990s, [[Jesse Lacey]], Garrett Tierney, Brian Lane were all members of the band The Rookie Lot, they eventually split off from the other members of the group and in 2000, formed Brand New in [[Merrick, New York]].<ref name="bandbio" /> The band signed to [[Triple Crown Records]] and in 2001, released their debut [[studio album]], ''[[Your Favorite Weapon]]'', a [[pop punk]] record. Their second album, ''[[Deja Entendu]]'', was released in 2003 and marked a stylistic change for the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:fzfyxqqrldhe|title=Brand New - The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2009-07-18}}</ref> The album's first two singles, "[[The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows]]" and "[[Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades]]", both received airplay on [[MTV2]] and [[Fuse TV]], entering the top 40 on the [[UK Singles Chart|United Kingdom Singles Chart]]. ''Deja Entendu'' was eventually certified gold in the [[Recording Industry Association of America|United States]].

Brand New moved to [[Interscope Records]] and released ''[[The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me]]'' in 2006. "[[Jesus (Brand New song)|Jesus]]" became their highest charting single in the US, peaking at number 30 on the [[Hot Alternative Tracks]] chart. In March 2008, the band started their own record label, named [[Procrastinate! Music Traitors]]. Their fourth album will be titled ''[[Daisy (Brand New album)|Daisy]]'' and is set to be released on September 22, 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=1171962|title=Brand New Album Title|publisher=[[AbsolutePunk.net]]|accessdate=2009-07-08}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and early releases (2000&ndash;2001)===
Prior to Brand New's official formation, in the late 1990s [[Jesse Lacey]], Garrett Tierney, Brian Lane were all members of the [[post-hardcore]] band The Rookie Lot, along with [[Brandon Reilly]].<ref name="Absinter">{{Cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=23568|title=Brand New interview - 08.14.03|publisher=[[AbsolutePunk.net]]|author=Jason Tate|accessdate=2009-07-23}}</ref> After the band's split and not playing together for a while, Lacey, Lane and Tierney started to rehearse again. They then recruited guitarist Vincent Accardi, who had been playing in a band called One Last Goodbye, since Reilly had joined [[The Movielife]].<ref name="bandbio" /><ref name="Absinter"/>

All four members had backgrounds linking into their local [[Long Island]] [[Independent music|independent]] and [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] music scenes, but with influences from an array of artists ranging from [[Buddy Rich]] to the [[Archers of Loaf]]. They eventually formed Brand New in 2000, in a basement in [[Merrick, New York]]. Their initial intention was always to "move outside of whatever notions they felt inclined to when they were making music as younger people."<ref name="bandbio" /> The band gained exposure in the local scene through playing shows with [[pop punk]] contemporaries [[Midtown (band)|Midtown]] and [[Glassjaw]], whilst also self-releasing a four-song demo.<ref name="amgbio"/><ref name="Absinter"/> They signed to [[Triple Crown Records]] after just their second-ever show.<ref name="News">{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/ny-ffmus3431963aug31,0,12784.story?coll=ny-music-utility|title=Long Island Sounds|work=[[Newsday]]|accessdate=2009-07-23||archivedate=2003-08-31|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20031010185551/www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/ny-ffmus3431963aug31,0,12784.story?coll=ny-music-utility}}</ref></small>

===Debut album: ''Your Favorite Weapon'' (2001&ndash;2002)===
Brand New's debut [[studio album]] ''[[Your Favorite Weapon]]'' was produced by friend and practical fifth member of the band [[Mike Sapone]].<ref name="bandbio" /><ref name="amgbio"/> The album has been described as being "bitter about ex-girlfriends", with an excessive concentration on "post-breakup angst", receiving relatively positive reviews, with [[Allmusic]] awarding it three out of five and [[Popmatters]] also being favourable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:3cftxqe0ldte|title=Your Favorite Weapon|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2009-07-23}}</ref><ref name="Popm">{{Cite web|url=http://popmatters.com/music/reviews/b/brandnew-yourfavorite.shtml|title=Brand New - Your Favorite Weapon|publisher=[[Popmatters]]|accessdate=2009-07-23}}</ref> It became a moderate success, selling over 50,000 copies.<ref name="ChartA">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/35351/are-brand-new-becoming-a-prog-rock-band|title=Are Brand New Becoming A Prog-Rock Band?|work=[[Chart (magazine)|ChartAttack]]|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref><ref name="Mara">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1475456/20030805/brand_new.jhtml|title=Brand New Singer Goes Long, Fears Turning Into Soccer Star Maradona|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref> The record deal gave Brand New the opportunity to tour, playing alongside the likes of [[Taking Back Sunday]] and touring the UK in support of [[Finch (US band)|Finch]], to a "great response" from the crowds.<ref name="amgbio">{{cite web |url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:k9fqxql0ld6e~T1 |title = Brand New: Biography |accessdate = 2008-03-22 |author = Hopkin, Kenyon|publisher = [[Allmusic]]}}</ref><ref name="South">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/southampton/music/brandnew_iview.shtml|title=Brand New interview|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref>

The only single released from ''Your Favorite Weapon'' was "Jude Law and a Semester Abroad". The song has been described by [[Allmusic]] as a "semi-hit",<ref name="amgbio"/> after it received airplay on both [[MTV2]] and [[Fuse TV|Fuse]]. 

===''Deja Entendu'' and acclaim (2003&ndash;2004)===
[[File:Brand_New_Jesse.jpg|thumb|right|Jesse Lacey performing live in [[San Diego]], November 2006.]]
Brand New's second studio album was written in "the year and-a-half or two years" that they were touring the material off of ''Your Favorite Weapon''. According to drummer Brian Lane, "Jesse [Lacey] wrote a lot of the lyrics about different things than 'I just broke up with my girlfriend' for the new record,"<ref name="Billfeat">{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/search/?Nty=1&Ntx=mode%2bmatchallpartial&Ntk=Keyword&Ns=FULL_DATE#/news/brand-new-1987338.story|title=Brand New|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|author=Barry A. Jeckell|date=2003-09-29|accessdate=2009-07-18}}</ref> as Lacey had written the songs on an [[acoustic guitar]] in his bedroom.<ref name="Already"/> Lane also explained that the band was now influenced by a range of different artists, "All of us got exposed to a lot of different music that all of us were listening to. For the first [album] we weren't in such close quarters for 24 hours a day. I think that has a lot to do with it." Unlike their first album, it was said that a lot of time and concentration went into making the album.<ref name="Billfeat"/>

The band released ''[[Deja Entendu]]'' through [[Razor & Tie]]/[[Triple Crown Records]] in June 2003, with it being issued in Europe and Australia in October 2003.<ref name="Bits"/> The album's title, ''Deja Entendu'', is [[French language|French]] for "already heard." It was explained as "very tongue-in-cheek," by singer Lacey. Further explaining the title, he told [[MTV]], "No matter who you are or what your band is about, you can't put a record out without people saying it's derivative of something else. So by saying the record's already been heard, it's kind of like saying, 'Yeah, you're right. We're doing something that's already been done before.'"<ref name="Already">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1472833/20030618/brand_new.jhtml|title=Already Heard Of Underground Upstarts Brand New? Consider Yourself Lucky|publisher=[[MTV]]|author=Joe D'Angelo|accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref> The album was described as a "stylistic leap" from ''Your Favorite Weapon'', with a "decidedly matured" sound.<ref name="amgbio"/> Frontman Jesse Lacey told ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' that although ''Deja Entendu'' does offer a different sound, the album "doesn't seem like we're departing from anything, really. I think we always knew that we had a lot of potential and there's a lot of different stuff we were able to do, and a lot of different sounds we wanted to make. Not too long after we recorded the first record, we were already wondering where we were going to go from there."<ref name="Bits">{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/search/?Nty=1&Ntx=mode%2bmatchallpartial&Ntk=Keyword&Ns=FULL_DATE#/news/billboard-bits-brand-new-vida-blue-kristofferson-1969318.story|title=Billboard Bits: Brand New, Vida Blue, Kristofferson|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=2009-07-18}}</ref>

''Deja Entendu'' debuted at number 63 on the [[Billboard 200]].<ref name="albumchart"/> After just seven weeks, the album's sales were at more than 51,000 copies, already closing in on the total figure of its predecessor, ''Your Favorite Weapon''.<ref name="Mara"/> Four years after its release in May 2007, it was certified [[List of music recording sales certifications|gold]] for surpassing 500,000 sales in the United States, by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Brand%20New&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2009&sort=Artist&perPage=25|title=Gold & Platinum - Deja Entendu|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=2009-01-09}}</ref>

''Deja Entendu'''s first single, "[[The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows]]", impacted radio airplay in July 2003, a month after the album's release. The song was said to be about regret, or "How there can be problems in a relationship and they get ignored. And how that often ends up as a broken home or some kind of bad situation down the road. It's kind of something that if it wasn't overlooked in the first place, you can kind of get through it." The song's [[music video]] chronicles the moments after a severe car accident, where a mortally wounded Lacey cannot depart for the next world until he knows that his girlfriend, also injured in the crash, is safe in this one. He says it "is about death or losing someone and it's those moments that you kind of look back on your life and realize all the regrets that you had, and all the things you wish you could change".<ref name="Already"/> They also made a music video for the second single, "[[Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades]]", where Lacey acts like a human [[voodoo doll]]; discovering that when he moves a particular body part, it is mimicked by the target of his action. "Since the song is about taking advantage of someone else," he said, "there's a pretty strong correlation between the video and the song." Both music videos gave the band exposure in the mainstream where ''Your Favorite Weapon'' went "virtually unnoticed", with the videos finding "constant" airplay on [[MTV]] and the band making its live television debut on ''[[The Jimmy Kimmel Show]]''.<ref name="Quiet">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1480306/20031110/brand_new.jhtml|title=Brand New Eschew Rocking For Voodoo|publisher=[[MTV]]|author=Joe D'Angelo|accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref><ref name="amgbio" /><ref name="Billfeat">{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/search/?Nty=1&Ntx=mode%2bmatchallpartial&Ntk=Keyword&Ns=FULL_DATE|1&Ne=125&N=126&Ntt=Brand%20New#/news/brand-new-1987338.story|title=Brand New|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|author=Barry A.

Three shows of the band's 24-date headlining US tour with [[Moneen]], [[Senses Fail]], and [[The Beautiful Mistake]] had sold out prior to even having released a single, with much of the buzz surrounding the band being produced by just [[word of mouth]], touring and Internet [[Internet forum|message boards]].<ref name="Already"/> ''Deja Entendu'''s success also earned them tours alongside [[New Found Glory]], [[Good Charlotte]], [[Dashboard Confessional]], and [[Blink-182]].<ref name="amgbio" /> The band went on to headline [[The Bamboozle]] festival with [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Alkaline Trio]], [[Thrice]], [[The Starting Line]], [[Fall Out Boy]], [[The Bouncing Souls]], [[Straylight Run]] and [[Flogging Molly]].<ref name="My chem">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1496226/20050125/my_chemical_romance.jhtml|title=My Chemical Romance, Brand New, Thrice To Headline Bamboozle Fest On Jersey Shore|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=2009-07-25}}</ref> They also made their second trip to the UK in 2004, their first as the headline act, the tour completely sold out.<ref name="South"/>

===''The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me'' (2005&ndash;2008)===
[[File:Jesse Lacey in 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Jesse Lacey performing at the [[Starland Ballroom]] in June 2006.]]
In late 2005, Brand New started recording their highly-anticipated third album in [[Oxford, Mississippi|Oxford]], [[Mississippi]] with producer [[Dennis Herring]], but later dropped him in favor of [[Mike Sapone]] with whom they had worked on their first album.<ref name="bandbio" />

On January 24, 2006, nine demos recorded in preparation of the new album were leaked onto the Internet. All nine tracks were untitled and were of unknown origin. It was stated by an unknown source that these demos "probably won't be on ''Fight Off Your Demons''", the then-rumored title for the new album based on the band's new website address. In the following months, with Brand New doing their first tour dates in over 18 months, a few songs from the demos were performed with a full band, some were fleshed out and had new lyrics. New songs had their debut as well during the summer tour dates. Brand New began their first tour in years on June 20, 2006 at New Jersey's famous [[Starland Ballroom]], where Lacey stated that the album had been completed the previous day.

''[[Alternative Press]]'' published a preliminary date of October 10, 2006, as the album's release date, this was later corrected on the band's official website, when it was announced that the new album would be released on November 21, 2006 in [[North America]], and the day before in Europe. Soon after, a track listing and cover art were revealed, as well as new information regarding the release of the first single - "[[Sowing Season]]". Having previously been leaked as a demo, the completed song began airing on radio on October 19, 2006, and appeared on their [[MySpace]] page a day later. According to Lacey in a radio interview from the UK ([[BBC Radio 1]] with [[Zane Lowe]]), the title ''[[The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me]]'' is taken from a conversation he had with his friend about the musician [[Daniel Johnston]], who has [[bipolar disorder]].<ref>{{cite news |title = Zane Lowe interview with Jesse Lacey |accessdate = 2006-11-02 |author = Zane Lowe |publisher = [[BBC Radio 1]] }}</ref>

In late December 2006, an unusual video was released for the instrumental track "Untitled", also known as "-", which mainly consists of a man [[Graffiti|spray painting]] a wall with "evil and good are raging Inside me" and correcting it to give the album title. On January 16, 2007, "[[Jesus (Brand New song)|Jesus Christ]]" was announced as being the official first single from the album. On January 19, the band performed the song on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''. They performed it again on February 26 on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/wahoo/index/php/20070226.phtml| title = Monday, February 26, 2007, Show #2713 Recap| accessdate = 2007-02-28| author = McIntee, Michael Z.| date = 2007-02-26| publisher = [[CBS]]}}</ref> 

From January to June 2007, the band toured the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia, including a headline slot on the UK's [[Give It A Name]] festival and playing the main stage at [[The Bamboozle]] festival. Despite the band's reluctance towards the press around the time of the release of the album, they were featured in ''Alternative Press'', a cover story for ''[[Rock Sound]]'', ''[[Kerrang!]]'', and ''[[NME]]''. The band went on tour for the fall of 2007, with openers [[Thrice]] and [[MewithoutYou]]. In early 2008, Brand New toured Australia and New Zealand on the [[Big Day Out]] festival.<ref name="bnBDOannouncement"> {{cite web |url = http://www.bigdayout.com/news/pressreleases.php |title = Big Day Out 08 Second Announcement |date=2007-11-20 |publisher = [[Big Day Out]]}}</ref>

In October 2007, the band announced via their official website that a new song, entitled "[[(Fork and Knife)]]", would be released online on October 23, 2007. "(Fork and Knife)", a rerecorded version of the track formerly known as "Untitled 7" from the leaked demos, was released as a non-album [[digital download]].

In March 2008, Brand New started their own record label, named [[Procrastinate! Music Traitors]].  The first act signed to the new label was longtime friend [[Kevin Devine]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://altpress.com/news/index.htm#3661 |title =  Brand New Start Record Label, Sign Kevin Devine |accessdate = 2008-03-22 |author = Heisel, Scott |date = 2008-03-21 |work = [[Alternative Press]]}}</ref> The first release from the label was a reissue of the 2006 Kevin Devine album, ''[[Put Your Ghost to Rest]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.selfproclaimedexpert.com/?p=618 |title = Brand New Starts A Record Label - Signs Kevin Devine - What a Great Choice |accessdate = 2008-03-27 |author = Terry, Ben |date = 2008-03-23 |publisher = Self-Proclaimed Expert }}</ref> in April 2008.

Which was announced during a live performance at the 2009 [[Glastonbury Festival]], where Brand New played two new songs, tentatively titled "Bride" and "Gasoline".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/brand-new/45702|title= Brand New preview all-new material at Glastonbury|work=[[NME]]|accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref> The band is also scheduled for main stage performances at [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]] in late 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leedsfestival.com/lineup/index.aspx|title=Leeds 2009 Festival: Line up|publisher=[[Reading and Leeds Festivals]]|accessdate=2009-07-18}}</ref>

In June 2009, UK music magazine ''[[Rock Sound]]'', claimed on their website that they had received a copy of the upcoming album, though it was, according to an image later posted by the editor, "incomplete".<ref>{{cite press release | title = Brand New - TBC| publisher = [[Polydor Records|Polydor Publicity]] | date = 2009-06-22 | url = http://www.rocksound.tv/images/uploads/brandnew.jpg| accessdate = 2009-06-27}}</ref> The site published a "tentative" track listing and reported the incomplete version that they had received to be roughly 30 minutes long.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocksound.tv/blog/entry/brand-new-tracklisting|title=Brand New Tracklisting?|work=[[Rock Sound]]|accessdate=2009-06-23|author=Andrew Kelham}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[Kerrang!]]'', Jesse Lacey commented on the upcoming album's content, "It's a pretty exhausting record. It's quite dense and I think some of the decisions we made don't always go in the most obvious direction. We were thinking a lot more about what we'd want to play when we were up onstage rather than actually what you'd want to hear on a record." He then questioned the future of the band, saying, "I think a lot of the record is about us trying to make decisions about how long the band should go on. When I listened back to it, I realized how many songs are about something coming to a close, or knowing when it's time to put something away and move on."<ref name="kerrang">{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/34219|title=Brand New talks new album, future of the band|publisher=[[Punknews.org]]|accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref>
