[[Image:Sting of Queen Wasp.jpg|right|thumb| Microscope magnified image of a yellowjacket wasp queen's sting ([[Vespula vulgaris]]).]] A '''stinger''' (technically referred to as a '''sting''') is a [[colloquialism|colloquial term]] for a sharp [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] or body part found in various [[animal]]s (typically [[Arthropod|arthropods]]) that usually delivers some kind of [[venom (poison)|venom]] (usually piercing the skin of another animal).  A true sting differs from other piercing structures in that it pierces by its own action, as opposed to [[teeth]], which pierce by the force of opposing [[jaw]]s, or plant [[spine (botany)|thorn]]s or stinging hairs, which pierce by the action of the victim.

"Sting" also refers to the wound caused by a sting. It is also used as a verb: "to sting" is to inflict such a wound.

==Zoology==

The main type of construction of stings is a sharp organ of offense or defense, especially when connected with a [[venom]] gland, and adapted to inflict a wound by piercing; as the caudal sting of a [[scorpion]].  The wasp has a very painful sting, and they will deliberately sting if they feel threatened.

The sting is typically located at the rear of the animal, near the [[tail]] (if any). Animals with stings include [[bee]]s, [[wasp]]s, [[hornet]]s, and [[scorpion]]s - although the scorpion's sting is not [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to that of the other three, but is rather an example of [[convergent evolution]]. 

Uniquely in [[honey bee]]s amongst bees and wasps, the workers' stings (a modified [[ovipositor]] as in other stinging [[Hymenoptera]]) are strongly barbed, and lodge in the flesh of [[mammal]]s upon use and tear free from the honey bee's body, leading to the bee's death within minutes. The sting has its own [[ganglion]] and it continues to saw into the target's flesh and release venom for several minutes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The question of how such a trait could have evolved, when it is of such an obvious disadvantage to the individual, is resolved when one realizes that mammalian predators can easily destroy the entire colony if not repelled; if the colony is destroyed, a worker, being sterile, will die without offspring, so only through defense of the colony can she see to it that her genes are passed on. The barbs ensure that a honey bee's attack is only suicidal if the attacker is a mammal;{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} they can sting other bees (in inter-colony raids) repeatedly. Thus, under natural conditions, the suicidal aspect of the honey bee sting's barbs only come into play in the event of an attack which threatens to wipe out the entire colony. The sting of nearly all other bees and wasps is not barbed, and so can be used to sting mammals repeatedly; the only exceptions ([[yellowjacket]] wasps and the [[Mexican honey wasp]]) have barbs so small that they do not cause the sting apparatus to pull free, so they may sting more than once.

==Non-arthropods with stings==

Organs that perform similar functions in non-arthropods are often referred to as "stingers", although they are all technically considered to be something else (e.g., a poisonous barb). These include the modified [[dermal denticle]] of the [[stingray]], the [[Platypus venom|venomous spurs]] on the hind legs of the male duck-billed [[platypus]],and even the [[cnidocyte]] [[tentacle]]s of the [[jellyfish]].

As well, the term is sometimes applied to the [[fang]] (a modified tooth) of a [[snake]]. One species of snake in [[South Africa]], ''[[Psammophylax rhombeatus]]'', is even known as ''skaapsteker'' ([[Afrikaans]] for sheep stinger).

==Botany==
In plants, the term "sting" is normally (and appropriately) used as a verb, but occasionally used as a noun refer to [[urticating hair]]s; sharp-pointed hollow hairs seated on a gland which secretes an acrid fluid, as in [[nettle]]s.  The points of these hairs usually break off in the wound, and the acrid fluid is pressed into it.
