'''Kalenderhane Mosque''' ({{lang-tr|Kalenderhane Camii}}) is a former [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[church (building)|church]] in [[Istanbul]], converted into a [[mosque]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. With high probability the church was originally dedicated to the '''Theotokos Kyriotissa'''. This building represents one among the few extant examples of a [[Byzantine Architecture|Byzantine]] church with domed [[Greek cross]] plan.

==Location==
The mosque is located in the [[Fatih]] district of [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], in the picturesque neighborhood of [[Vefa]], and lies immediately to the south of the easternmost extant section of the [[Valens Aqueduct|aqueduct of Valens]], and less than one km to the southeast of the [[Vefa Kilise Mosque]].

== History ==
The first building on this site was a [[Thermae|Roman bath]], followed by a sixth-century (the dating was based on precise coin finds in [[Stratification (archeology)|stratigraphic excavation]]) [[hall church]] with an [[apse]] laying up against the [[Valens Aqueduct|Aqueduct of Valens]]. Later <U+2013> possibly in the seventh century <U+2013> a much larger church was built to the south of the first church. A third church, which reused the [[sanctuary]] and the apse (later destroyed by the Ottomans) of the second one, can be dated to the end of the twelfth century, during the late [[Comneni]]an period.<ref name=ma171>Mathews (1976), p. 171.</ref> It may date to between 1197 and 1204, since [[Constantine Stilbes]] alluded to its destruction in a fire in 1197.<ref name=mag22730>Magdalino (2007) pp. 227-230.</ref> The church was surrounded by monastery buildings, which disappeared totally during the Ottoman period. After the [[Fourth Crusade|Latin conquest]] of [[Constantinople]], the building was used by the [[Crusades|Crusader]]s as a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church, and partly officiated by [[Franciscan]] clergy.<ref name=mw156>M<U+00FC>ller-Wiener (1977), p. 156.</ref>

After the [[Fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]] in 1453, the church was assigned personally by [[Mehmed II]] to the ''Kalenderi'' sect of the [[Dervish]]. The Dervishes used it as a [[zaviye]] and ''[[imaret]]'' (public kitchen), and the building has been known since as ''Kalenderhane'' ({{lang-tr|"The house of the Kalenderi"}}). 

The [[Waqf]] (foundation) was endowed with several properties in [[Thrace]], and many [[Turkish bath|hamam]]s in Istanbul and [[Galata]].<ref name=mw156/> Some years later, Arpa Emini Mustafa Efendi built a ''Mektep'' (school) and a [[Medrese]].<ref name=mw156/>

In 1746, Hac<U+0131> Be<U+015F>ir A<U+011F>a (d. 1747), the ''[[Kizlar Agha|Kizlar A<U+011F>as<U+0131>]]'' of the [[Topkap<U+0131> Palace]],<ref>He was the chief of the custodians of the Harem in the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]]'s Palace. During the last years of his life he endowed several religious foundations. M<U+00FC>ller-Wiener (1977), p. 156.</ref> built a [[mihrab]], [[minbar]] and [[M<U+00FC>ezzin mahfili|mahfil]], completing the conversion of the building into a mosque.<ref name=mw156/> Ravaged by fire and damaged by earthquakes, the mosque was restored in 1855 and again between 1880 and 1890.<ref name=mw156/> It was abandoned in the 1930s, after the collapse of the [[minaret]] due to lightning, and the demolition of the Medrese.<ref name=mw156/>

The conservation of the building dates from the 1970s, when it was extensively restored and studied in a ten-year effort by Cecil L. Striker and [[Do<U+011F>an Kuban]], who restored its twelfth century condition. Moreover, the minaret and the mihrab were rebuilt, which allowed the mosque to reopen for worship.<ref>A book by the two authors of the restoration was published in 1997.</ref>

The restoration also provided a solution to the problem of the dedication of the church: while before it was thought that the church was named after ''[[Theotokos]] t<U+0113>s Diakoniss<U+0113>s'' ("Virgin of the [[Deaconess]]es") or ''[[Christ]]os ho Akatal<U+0113>ptos'' ("Christ the Inconceivable"), the discovery of a donor [[fresco]] in the southeastern chapel and of another fresco over the main entrance to the [[narthex]] both bearing the word "Kyriotissa" ([[Greek language|Greek]] for ''Enthroned''), makes highly probable that the church was dedicated to the Theotokos Kyriotissa.<ref name=ma172>Mathews (1976), p. 172.</ref>

==Architecture and decoration==
[[File:<U+0130>stanbul 5606.jpg|220px|thumb|The sanctuary with the mihrab and minbar]]

The building has a central [[Greek Cross]] plan with deep [[barrel vault]]s over the arms, and is surmounted by a [[dome]] with 16 ribs. The structure has a typically middle Byzantine [[brickwork]] with alternating layers of [[brick]] and stone masonry. The entry is via an [[narthex|esonarthex]] and an exonarthex (added much later) in the west side.

An upper gallery over the esonarthex, following the same plan of the one existing in the [[Church of the Pantokrator (Constantinople)|Church of the Pantokrator]], was removed in 1854.<ref name=ma171/> Also the north and south aisles along the [[nave]] were destroyed, possibly during the nineteenth century too. The tall triple arches connecting the aisles with the nave are now the lower windows of the church.

The sanctuary is on the east side; however, the reconstructed mihrab and minbar are in a corner to obtain the proper alignment with [[Mecca]].  

Two small chapels named ''[[prothesis (altar)|prothesis]]'' and ''[[diaconicon|diakonikon]]'', typical of the Byzantine churches of the middle and late period have survived. 

The interior decoration of the church, consisting of beautiful colored marble panels and [[Molding (decorative)|moldings]], and of elaborated [[icon]] frames, is largely extant. The building possesses two features which both represent an ''unicum'' in Istanbul: a [[Mosaic#Byzantine_mosaics|mosaic]], one meter square, representing  the "[[Presentation of Christ in the Temple|Presentation of Christ]]", which is the only [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|pre-iconoclastic]] exemplar of a religious subject surviving in the city, and a cycle of frescoes of the thirteenth century (found in a chapel at the southeast corner of the building, and painted during the Latin domination) portraying  the life of [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis of Assisi]].<ref name=ma172>Mathews (1976), p. 172.</ref> This is the oldest known representation of the saint, and may have been painted only a few years after his death in 1226. Both have now been detached and partially restored, and can be seen in the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum|Archaeological Museum of Istanbul]].

As a whole, the mosque of Kalenderhane represents <U+2013> together with the [[G<U+00FC>l Mosque]] in Istanbul, the [[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Church of Hagia Sophia]] in [[Thessaloniki]] and the Church of the Dormition in (''[[Dormition of the Theotokos|Koimesis]]'') in [[Iznik]] (Nicaea),<ref>This church was destroyed by an act of vandalism in 1920, but was studied some years before. Krautheimer (1986).</ref> one of the main architectural examples of a domed Greek cross church from the [[byzantine Architecture|Byzantine middle period]].<ref>Krautheimer (1986), p. 317.</ref>
