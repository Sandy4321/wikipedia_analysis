'''Nevado del Ruiz''', also known as '''Mesa de Herveo'''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parquesnacionales.gov.co/PNN/portel/libreria/php/decide.php?patron=02.02020802 |title=General Data - Los Nevados |publisher=Parques Nacionales Naturales de Colombia |accessdate=March 29, 2009}}</ref> or '''Kumanday''',<ref name=SDSU/> is the northernmost volcano of the [[Andean Volcanic Belt]], lying about {{Convert|129|km|mi|0|sp=us}} west of [[Bogot<U+00E1>]] in the [[Caldas Department]] of [[Colombia]].  It is a [[stratovolcano]], composed of many layers of [[lava]] alternating with hardened [[volcanic ash]] and other [[pyroclastic rock]]s. Nevado del Ruiz has been active for about two million years, since the early [[Pleistocene epoch|Pleistocene]] or late [[Pliocene epoch]], with three major eruptive periods. The current volcanic cone formed during the "present" eruptive period, which began 150 thousand years ago.

Nevado del Ruiz usually generates [[Plinian eruption]]s, which produce swift-moving currents of hot gas and rock called [[pyroclastic flow]]s. These eruptions often cause massive [[lahar]]s (mud and debris flows), which pose a threat to human life and the environment. On November 11, 1985, a small eruption produced an enormous lahar that buried and desolated the town of [[Armero]], causing an estimated 23,000 deaths. This event later became known as the [[Armero tragedy]]<U+2014>the deadliest lahar in recorded history. Similar but less deadly incidents occurred in 1595 and 1845, consisting of a small explosive eruption followed by a large lahar.

The volcano is part of [[Los Nevados|Los Nevados National Park]], which also contains several other volcanoes. The summit of Nevado del Ruiz is covered by large glaciers, although these have retreated significantly since 1985 due to [[global warming|atmospheric warming]]. The volcano continues to pose a threat to the nearby towns and villages, and it is estimated that up to 500,000 people could be at risk from lahars.

Nevado del Ruiz, which lies about {{Convert|129|km|mi|0|sp=us}} west of Bogot<U+00E1>, is part of the [[Andes]] mountain range. The volcano is part of the [[Cordillera Central (Colombia)|Ruiz&ndash;Tolima volcanic massif]] (or Cordillera Central), a group of five ice-capped volcanoes which includes the [[Nevado del Tolima|Tolima]], [[Santa Isabel (volcano)|Santa Isabel]], [[Nevado del Quind<U+00ED>o|Quindio]] and [[Cerro Mach<U+00ED>n|Machin]] volcanoes.<ref name=Williams>{{Cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/p1386i/colombia/ruiz.html|last=S.

=== Glaciers ===
The summit of Nevado del Ruiz is covered by [[glacier]]s (''nevado'' means "snow covered" in Spanish), which formed over many thousands of years, and have generally retreated since the [[last glacial maximum]]. From 28,000 to 21,000 years ago, glaciers occupied about {{convert|1500|km2|mi2|sigfig=1|sp=us}} of the Ruiz&ndash;Tolima massif. As late as 12,000 years ago, when the ice sheets from the last glacial period were retreating, they still covered {{convert|800|km2|mi2|sigfig=1|sp=us}}. During the [[Little Ice Age]], which lasted from about 1600 to 1900&nbsp;CE, the ice cap covered approximately {{convert|100|km2|mi2|sigfig=1|sp=us}}.<ref name=Thouret1996>{{cite journal |last=Thouret |first=Jean-Claude |coauthors=Van der Hammen, Thomas; Salomons, Barry; and Juvigne, Etienne |title=Paleoenvironmental Changes and Glacial Stades of the Last 50,000 Years in the Cordillera Central, Colombia |year=1996 |volume=46 |issue=1 |journal=Quaternary Research |pages=1<U+2013>18 |doi=10.1006/qres.1996.0039}}</ref>

== Flora and fauna ==
[[File:Spectacled Bear Barquisimeto.jpg|thumb|[[Spectacled bear]]]]
Nevado del Ruiz is generally poorly forested due to its high elevation, and its forest cover decreases with increasing elevation. At lower elevations, well-developed [[mesic forest]]s (20&ndash;35&nbsp;meters / 66&ndash;110&nbsp;ft high) are present. Above these but below the [[tree line]], parts of the volcano are covered with dwarf forests {{convert|3|<U+2013>|8|m|ft|sigfig=1|sp=us}} high. Above the tree line, in the [[P<U+00E1>ramo]] zone, the vegetation is dominated by plants such as bunchgrass and [[Espeletia]].<ref name=BotanySI/> Regional vegetation consists of different families of woody plants, including [[Rubiaceae]], [[Leguminosae]], [[Melastomataceae]], [[Lauraceae]], and [[Moraceae]]. Flowers such as ''[[Polypodiaceae]] s.l.'', [[Araceae]], [[Poaceae]], [[Asteraceae]], [[Piperaceae]], and Orchidaceae are also present in the region.<ref name=BotanySI/>

Animals living on the volcano include the [[Tapirus pinchaque|mounting tapir]] and [[spectacled bear]], which are designated as [[Threatened species|threatened]].<ref name=BotanySI/> Other animals inhabiting the surrounding region include the [[Bolborhynchus ferrugineifrons|rufous-fronted parakeet]], [[Bearded Helmetcrest|bearded helmetcrest]] and [[Herveo Plump Toad|Herveo plump toad]]. The volcano is home to 27 species of birds endemic to Colombia, with 14 of these species confined to the region around the volcano. 15 bird species in the area are considered threatened.<ref name=BotanySI/>

== Los Nevados National Park ==
Nevado del Riuz is one of several stratovolcanoes within ''[[Los Nevados|Parque Nacional Natural Los Nevados]]'', a national park located west of Bogot<U+00E1> in the centre of the Colombian Andes.

== Eruptive history ==
The first eruptions of Nevado del Ruiz occurred about two million years ago in the early [[Pleistocene]] or late [[Pliocene]] epoch.<ref name=Huggel2007/> Three primary eruption periods in the history of the massif have been identified: ''ancestral'', ''older'' and ''present''. During the ''ancestral'' period between one million to two million years ago, a complex of large stratovolcanoes was created.<ref name=Thouret/> Between 1.0 million and 0.8 million years ago, they partially collapsed, forming large (5<U+2013>10&nbsp;km wide) [[caldera]]s. During the ''older'' period, which lasted from 0.8 million to 0.2 million years ago, a new complex of large stratovolcanoes developed (including Older Ruiz, Tolima, Quindio, and Santa Isabel). Once again explosive summit calderas formed from 0.2 million to 0.15 million years ago.<ref name=Thouret/>

The ''present'' period began about 150,000&nbsp;years ago and involved the development of the present volcanic edifice through the emplacement of lava domes made of [[andesite]] and [[dacite]] (igneous rocks) inside older calderas.<ref name=Huggel2007/> During the past 11,000&nbsp;years, Nevado del Ruiz passed through at least 12 eruption stages, which included multiple [[Landslide|slope failures]] (rock avalanches), [[pyroclastic flow]]s and [[lahar]]s leading to partial destruction of the summit domes.<ref name=Huggel2007/><ref name=Thouret/> During the past several thousand years, eruptions of the volcanoes in the Ruiz<U+2013>Tolima massif have mostly been small, and the pyroclastic flow deposits have been much less voluminous than during the Pleistocene.<ref name=Thouret/> Since the volcano's earlier eruptions are not recorded, [[volcanologist]]s have used [[tephrochronology]] to date them.<ref name=GVPEH/>

During recorded history, eruptions have consisted primarily of a central vent eruption (in the caldera) followed by an explosive eruption, then [[lahar]]s. Ruiz's earliest identified [[Holocene]] eruption was about 6660&nbsp;BC, and further eruptions occurred in 1245&nbsp;BC&nbsp;<U+00B1>&nbsp;150&nbsp;years (dated through [[radiocarbon dating]]), about 850&nbsp;BC, 200&nbsp;BC&nbsp;<U+00B1>&nbsp;100 years, 350&nbsp;AD&nbsp;<U+00B1>&nbsp;300 years, 675&nbsp;AD&nbsp;<U+00B1>&nbsp;50 years, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps),{{ref|Perhaps|[b]}} 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps),{{ref|Perhaps|[b]}} 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps),{{ref|Perhaps|[b]}} 1845, 1916, December 1984 <U+2013> March 1985, September 1985 <U+2013> July 1991, and possibly in April 1994.{{ref|Perhaps|[b]}} Many of these eruptions involved a central vent eruption, a flank vent eruption, and a [[phreatic explosion|phreatic (steam) explosion]].<ref name=GVPEH>{{cite gvp|vnum=1501-02=&volpage=erupt|title=Nevado del Ruiz: Eruptive History|accessdate=December 13, 2008}}</ref> Ruiz is the second-most active volcano in Colombia after [[Galeras]].<ref name=USGS1/>

=== Armero tragedy of 1985 ===
{{main|Armero tragedy}}

During November 1984, geologists observed an increasing level of seismic activity near Nevado del Ruiz.<ref name=Naranjo1986/> Other signs of a forthcoming eruption included increased [[fumarole]] activity, deposition of sulfur on the summit of the volcano, and small [[phreatic eruption]]s. In the latter, hot magma came in contact with water, resulting in explosions as the water was almost instantly turned into steam. The most notable of these events was an ash ejection on September 11, 1985.<ref name=Naranjo1986/> The activity of the volcano decreased in October 1985.<ref name=Naranjo1986/> The most likely explanation of the events is that new magma rose into the volcanic edifice before September 1985.<ref name=Naranjo1986/>

[[Image:Nevado del Ruiz 1985.jpg|thumb|left|Before the eruption in 1985]]
An Italian volcanological mission analyzed gas samples from fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor and proved them to be a mixture of [[carbon dioxide]] and [[sulfur dioxide]], indicating a direct release of [[magma]] into the surface environment. The mission's report, delivered on October 22, 1985, judged the risk of lahars to be very high. The report proposed various simple preparedness techniques to local authorities.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VCS-48B5B5D-9J&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=2501a91a2ad56e7bd5d09dabe454f712|last=Barberi, F., Martini, M., and Rosi, M.|year=1990|month=July|title=Nevado del Ruiz volcano (Colombia): pre-eruption observations and the 13 November 1985 catastrophic event|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|volume=42|issue=1<U+2013>2|pages=1<U+2013>12|doi=10.1016/0377-0273(90)90066-O}}</ref>

In November of 1985, volcanic activity once again increased<ref name=Naranjo1986/> as magma neared the surface. The volcano began releasing increasing quantities of gases rich in sulfur dioxide and elementary [[sulfur]].

[[File:Armero aftermath Marso.jpg|thumb|Armero was located in the center of this photograph, taken late November 1985.]]
The eruption produced pyroclastic flows that melted summit glaciers and snow, generating four thick [[lahar]]s that raced down river valleys on the volcano's flanks.<ref name="usgs"/> It also destroyed a small lake that was observed in Arenas crater several months before the eruption.<ref name=Naranjo1986/> Water in such volcanic lakes tends to be extremely salty and contain dissolved volcanic gases. The lake's hot, acidic water significantly accelerated the melting of the ice; this effect was confirmed by the large amounts of [[sulfate]]s and [[chloride]]s found in the lahar flow.<ref name=Naranjo1986/> 

The lahars, formed of water, ice, [[pumice]], and other rocks,<ref name="usgs"/> mixed with clay as they traveled down the volcano's flanks.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lowe |first=Donald R. |authorlink= |coauthors=Williams, Stanley N., Leigh, Henry, Connort, Charles B., Gemmell, J.

One of the lahars virtually erased the small town of Armero, which lay in the Lagunilla River valley. Of Armero's population of 28,700, over 23,000 were killed and approximately 5,000 were injured.

The loss of life during the 1985 eruption was due partly to the fact that scientists did not know precisely when the eruption would occur, and the authorities would not take costly preventative measures without clear warnings of imminent danger.<ref name=Fielding>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2001/volcanohelltrans.shtml|title=Volcano Hell Transcript |last=Fielding |first=Emma |publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=September 3, 2008}}</ref> Because the volcano's last substantial eruption occurred 140 years ago, it was also hard for many to accept the danger the volcano presented; locals even called it the "Sleeping Lion".<ref name=BBC/> Hazard maps showing Armero would be completely flooded after a eruption were distributed more than a month before the eruption, but the Colombian Congress criticized the scientific and [[civil defense]] agencies for scaremongering. Local authorities failed to alert people to the seriousness of the situation, with Armero's mayor and a priest both reassuring the populace after an ash eruption on the afternoon of November 13 and the consequent ashfall early that evening.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mileti|first=Dennis S.|coauthors=Bolton, Patricia A.; Fernandez,  Gabriel; Updike, Randall G.|title=The Eruption of Nevado Del Ruiz Volcano Colombia, South America, November 13, 1985|publisher=Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems (National Academy Press)|year=1991|location=Washington, D.C.|page=51<U+2013>53|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1784&page=51}}</ref> Another factor was the storm that hit that evening, causing electrical outages and hindering communications. Civil defense officials from four nearby towns tried to warn Armero the lahar was approaching in the hour or so before it reached Armero, but failed to make radio contact.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mileti|first=Dennis S.|coauthors=Bolton, Patricia A.; Fernandez,  Gabriel; Updike, Randall G.|title=The Eruption of Nevado Del Ruiz Volcano Colombia, South America, November 13, 1985|publisher=Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems (National Academy Press)|year=1991|location=Washington, D.C.|page=61|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1784&page=61}}</ref>

Scientists later looked back to the hours before the eruption and noticed that several long-period earthquakes, which start out strong and then slowly die out, had occurred in the final hours before the eruption. Volcanologist Bernard Chouet said that, "the volcano was screaming 'I'm about to explode'", but the scientists who were studying the volcano at the time of the eruption were not able to read this signal.<ref>{{cite news|last=BBC contributors |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Signs of an eruption&nbsp;<U+2014> A scientist has found a way to use earthquakes to predict when volcanoes will erupt|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3183047.stm |work=[[BBC]] |date=August 27, 2003 |accessdate=September 13, 2008}}</ref>

== Current threats and preparedness ==
[[Image:El ruiz volcano.jpg|thumb|Nevado del Ruiz seen from [[Manizales]], 2006]]
The volcano continues to pose a serious threat to nearby towns and villages. The most likely hazard is small-volume eruptions, which might destabilize glaciers and trigger [[lahar]]s.<ref name=Thouret/> Despite the significant retrenchment of the volcano's glaciers, the volume of ice atop Nevado del Ruiz and other volcanoes in the Ruiz&ndash;Tolima massif remains large. Melting merely 10% of the ice would produce mudflows with a volume of up to 200&nbsp;million cubic meters&mdash;similar to the mudflow that destroyed Armero in 1985.<ref name=Huggel2007/> Such lahars can travel up to 100&nbsp;km along river valleys in a matter of few hours.<ref name=Huggel2007/> Estimates show that up to 500,000 people living in the Combeima, Chinchina, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are at risk, and 100,000 of these are considered to be at high risk.<ref name=Thouret/>{{ref|Bogota|[a]}} Lahars poses a threat to nearby towns of [[Honda, Tolima|Honda]], [[Mariquita]], [[Ambalema]], Chinchina, [[Herveo]], [[Villahermosa,_Tolima|Villa Hermosa]], [[Salgar]] and [[La Dorada]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Mileti|first=Dennis S.|coauthors=Bolton, Patricia A.; Fernandez,  Gabriel; Updike, Randall G.|title=The Eruption of Nevado Del Ruiz Volcano Colombia, South America, November 13, 1985|publisher=Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems (National Academy Press)|year=1991|location=Washington, D.C.|page=80|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1784&page=80|isbn=0309044774}}</ref> Although small eruptions are more likely, the two million-year eruptive history of the Ruiz&ndash;Tolima massif includes numerous large eruptions, indicating that the threat of a large eruption cannot be ignored.<ref name=Thouret/> A large eruption would have more widespread effects, including the potential closure of [[El Dorado International Airport|Bogot<U+00E1>'s airport]] due to ashfall.<ref name=McDowell>{{cite journal|last=McDowell|first=Bart|title=Eruption in Colombia|journal=National Geographic|year=1986|month=May|pages=640&ndash;653|url=http://encarta.msn.com/sidebar_762503944/eruption_in_colombia.html}}</ref>

As the Armero tragedy was exacerbated by the lack of early warnings,<ref name=Fielding/> unwise land use,<ref name=Touret2004/> and the unpreparedness of nearby communities,<ref name=Fielding/> the government of Colombia created a special program (''Oficina Nacional para la Atencion de Desastres'', 1987) to prevent such incidents in the future.
