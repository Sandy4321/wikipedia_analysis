'''The Infanta Do<U+00F1>a Maria Cristina of Spain''' (''Do<U+00F1>a Mar<U+00ED>a Cristina Teresa Alejandra Mar<U+00ED>a de Guadalupe Mar<U+00ED>a de la Concepci<U+00F3>n Ildefonsa Victoria Eugenia de Borb<U+00F3>n y Battenberg'') (12 December [[1911]] - 23 December [[1996]]) was the fourth child of [[HM]] [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]] and Queen [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg|Ena of Spain]] and paternal aunt of the current [[King Juan Carlos I]].

Infanta Maria Cristina was born at the [[Palacio Real]] in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. The Spanish Royal Family left the country in 1931, in the face of Republican demonstrations, settling in [[Paris]], before moving to [[Fontainebleau]].

By 1933 King Alfonso and his daughters, the [[Infanta Beatriz of Spain|Infantas Beatriz]] and Maria Cristina, had moved to [[Rome]]. Their father cautiously warned would-be suitors of the inherent dangers of [[hemophilia]], that had infected two of the king's sons ([[Alfonso of Spain, Prince of Asturias|Alfonso]] and [[Infante Gonzalo of Spain|Gonzalo]]).

She married Enrico Eugenio Marone-Cinzano (1895-1968), 1st Count of Marone, on September 1, 1940 in Rome.  The marriage produced four daughters:

* Victoria Marone-Cinzano, born 5 March 1941. 
* Giovanna Marone-Cinzano, born 31 January 1943. 
* Mar<U+00ED>a Teresa Marone-Cinzano, born 4 January 1945. 
*Anna Sandra Marone-Cinzano, born 21 December 1948. 

Infanta Maria Cristina returned to Spain and spent period of times there, but never lived there permantly.  She died in Madrid on December 23, 1996, and was given a state funeral but was buried in the Marone-Cinzano Pantheon in [[Italy]].
