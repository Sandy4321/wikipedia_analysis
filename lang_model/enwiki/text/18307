'''Nikolai Makarov''' (born [[December 19]], [[1948]] in [[Cheliabinsk]], [[Russia]]) is a retired [[ice hockey]] player who played in the Soviet Hockey League.  He played for [[Traktor Chelyabinsk]]. He is the elder brother of the Soviet (and NHL) hockey legend [[Sergei Makarov]].

==Playing career==
===Career in Soviet Union===
Nikolai Makarov was a top Defenceman for [[Traktor Chelyabinsk]] during his time there. Makarov played in Soviet League from 1969 to 1982 as he had a 17 year career in Soviet top leagues.

Makarov also was part of the feared Soviet National Ice hockey Team in 1981 Ice Hockey World Championships.

===Career in Finland===
In [[1982]] Makarov was bought by [[SM-liiga]] team [[Jokerit]]. Makarov became a premier defenceman for Jokerit and was selected the best defenceman of the year in [[1983]]. At the end of the regular season 1982<U+2013>82, an opponent slashed his arm with his stick, causing a major injury, and Makarov was not able to recover fully before the play-off finals against IFK Helsinki, which Jokerit lost 3-2. One might speculate if Jokerit would have fared better in the finals, had Makarov been healthy throughout the series. The following year Makarov still played for Jokerit, but his play was visibly less energetic. At the end of his two years with Jokerit he retired from active playing in [[1984]].

Nikolai Makarov was inducted into the [[Russian and Soviet Hockey Hall of Fame]] in [[1981]].
