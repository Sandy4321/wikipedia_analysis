==Professional career==
===Pre-draft===
At the 2009 [[NFL Combine]], Smith weighed 332 pounds.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.usatoday.com/thehuddle/2009/02/alabamas-smith.html| title=Alabama's Smith sorry after going AWOL from combine| work=USA Today| date=2009-02-21| accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref> He decided to leave the combine early in order to prepare for Alabama's Pro Day on March 11, 2009. Smith, however, did not inform his group leader at the combine before he left, and later apologized, stating: "If I had the chance to do it all over, I wouldn't have handled it the way I did. I should have told my group leader that I was leaving, and I didn't. I didn't mean to ruffle any feathers or step on any toes. I didn't mean to grandstand anyone at the combine. That was not my intention at all, and I apologize for my mistake." Smith also admitted that he wasn't prepared or in shape.<ref name="Smith-bails-combine" /><ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/22/sports/sp-nfl-combine22| title=Tackle Andre Smith leaves without notice| author=Farmer, Sam| work=Los Angeles Times| date=2009-02-22| accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref>

His Pro Day performance at Alabama on March 11, 2009 was equally unimpressive, although his weight was down to 325 pounds. It was expected that his poor performances at the Combine and at Pro Day would strongly impact his draft positioning.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=526524| title=Alabama OT Smith bombs in pro day workout| author=Lande, Ross| work=Sporting News| date=2009-03-11| accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1153362/index.htm| title=Andre Smith Is A Riddle| author=Trotter, Jim| work=Sports Illustrated| date=2009-03-23| accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref>
