'''Gerard Vandergucht''' (or '''van der Gucht''') (1696/7<U+2013>18 March 1776) was an  English [[engraving|engraver]] and [[art dealer]].

Vandergucht born in [[London]], the elder son of the [[Flanders|Flemish]] engraver [[Michael Vandergucht]]. He was taught engraving by his father, as was his younger brother [[Jan Vandergucht]] (or John) (c.1699-c.1730).  Gerard was also taught drawing by [[Louis Ch<U+00E9>ron]], and studied at [[Godfrey Kneller]]'s [[Great Queen Street Academy]].<ref>[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp10800 National Portrait Gallery]</ref> He surpassed the restrained style of engraving favoured by his father, and became one of the leading engravers in London by adopting the French method of combining precise engraving with [[etching|etched]] tones.<ref name = "dnb">Timothy Clayton, <U+2018>Vandergucht, Gerard (1696/7<U+2013>1776)<U+2019>, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28072, accessed 10 May 2011]</ref>

In 1719, he was commissioned by [[James Thornhill]] to engrave four designs for the [[cupola]] of [[St Paul's Cathedral]].  He took over his father's house - the Golden Head in Queen Street, Bloomsbury - following his father's death in 1725.  He married Mary Liney on 24 August 1725.  They had over 30 children, including the painter and picture dealer [[Benjamin Vandergucht]].<ref name = "dnb"/> 

He became a leading publisher of engraved prints and book illustrations, and taught Robert White and [[Francis Patton]]. 

In 1735 he took a leading role in the artists' demands for [[copyright]] protection which led to an extension of the provisions established by [[William Hogarth]] in the [[Engraving Copyright Act 1734]]. The 1734 act only protected original designs. Vandergucht and his supporters successfully lobbied to extend copyright protection to cover all prints.<ref>Rose, Mark.

He concentrated on art dealing in the last 16 years of his life, selling prints, drawings, paintings and statues.  He was a member of the [[Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce]].  He moved to Vandyke's Head, [[Great Brook Street]], in 1758, where he died in 1776.
