The '''Wyandotte Nation''' is a [[Federally recognized tribes|federally recognized Native American tribe]] in Oklahoma. They are descendants of the [[Wyandot|Wendat Confederacy]] and Native Americans with territory near [[Georgian Bay]] and [[Lake Huron]]. Under pressure from [[Iroquois]] and other tribes, then from [[Europe]]an settlers and the United States government, the tribe gradually moved south and west: to [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]], [[Kansas]] and [[Oklahoma]] in the United States. One group of descendants is in [[Quebec, Canada]]. 

==History==
Wyandotte, or Wendat, are [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]] Indians from the [[Eastern Woodlands tribes|eastern woodlands]]. Their name is thought to mean "dwellers on a peninsula" or "islanders."<ref name="ohs">Stansfield, Rick. [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/W/WY001.html Wyandotte.] ''Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History.'' 2009 (retrieved 8 Feb 2009)</ref>

The first Wendat Confederacy was created around 1400 CE, when the ''Attignawantan'' (Bear Nation) and ''Attigingueenongnahac'' (Cord People) combined forces. They, in turn, were joined by the ''Arendaronon'' (People of the Rocks), ''Ataronchronon'' (People of One Lodge), and the ''Tahontaenrat'' (Deer Nation). The latter three tribes are commonly believed to be remnant bands of the [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians|St. Lawrence Iroquois]]. The confederacy dispersed around 1650.<ref>[http://www.wyandotte-nation.org/wendat_confederacy.html History Briefs.]  ''Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma.'' 2008 (retrieved 8 Feb 2009)</ref>

In the early 16th century, the Wyandotte settled near present-day [[Montreal, Canada]]. French explorers encountered the Wyandotte around 1536 and dubbed them the Huron. They were fierce enemies of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]]. In 1659, they were defeated by the Iroquois and forced to flee west, where they settled with [[Odawa]] and [[Illinois Confederation|Illinois]] tribes.<ref name="ohs"/>

By the beginning of the 18th century, the Wyandotte people moved into the [[Ohio River Valley]], extending into areas of what would become [[West Virginia]], [[Indiana]] and [[Michigan]]. Around 1745, large groups settled near [[Sandusky, Ohio]]. After the [[American Revolution]], a treaty signed with the United States in 1785 confirmed their landholdings. However, the 1795 [[Treaty of Greenville]] greatly reduced its size.<ref name="ohs"/>

The 1817 [[Treaty of Fort Meigs]] reduced the Wyandottes' lands drastically, leaving them only small parcels in [[Ohio]]. In 1842, the Wyandotte lost all of their land in the east.<ref name="ohs"/> They made a treaty with the US government by which they were to be compensated for their lands. 

They were removed to the [[Lenape|Delaware]] Reservation in present-day [[Kansas]].<ref name="ohs"/> During this migration and the early months, their people suffered much illness. In 1843 survivors buried their dead on a high ridge overlooking the Missouri River in what became the [[Huron Cemetery]]. (In 1971 it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. It is now called the [[Wyandot National Burying Ground]].)

After the [[American Civil War]], Wyandotte people who had not become citizens of the United States in 1855 in Kansas, were removed a final time in 1867. They were settled on 20,000 acres in the northeast corner of [[Indian Territory]].<ref name="ohs"/>  In 1893 the [[Dawes Act]] required that this land be divided into individual allotments. The land was divided among 241 tribal members, who were listed on the Dawes Rolls. The Wyandotte members in Oklahoma retained some tribal structure, and still had control of the communal property of the Huron Cemetery, by then annexed into Kansas City.<ref name="ohs"/>

===Huron Cemetery===
For decades, the Huron Cemetery was a source of controversy between the Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma and Wyandot descendants in Kansas. The former wanted to sell the property for redevelopment. Kansas City was also eager for that development, as the city had annexed all of the property in the area. By 1907 it was a prime site; nearby was a new Carnegie Library, the Brund Hotel, and the Masonic Temple under reconstruction after a fire.

In 1906 the Wyandotte Nation authorized the Secretary of Interior to sell the cemetery, with the bodies to be reinterred at nearby [[Quindaro]] Cemetery. This proposal was opposed by [[Lyda Conley]] and her two sisters in Kansas City, who launched what became a multi-year campaign to preserve the burying ground. They achieved much support, and in 1916 Senator Charles Curtis of Kansas won passage of a bill protecting the cemetery as a national park and providing for some maintenance.

Over the years, the Wyandotte Nation continued to explore ways to increase revenues for the tribe, including redevelopment of the Huron Cemetery. Descendants in Kansas vigorously resisted these efforts. In 1971 the cemetery was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. In 1998 the Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma and the Wyandot Nation of Kansas came to agreement to preserve the [[Wyandot National Burying Ground]] for religious, cultural and related uses appropriate to its sacred history and use.

===Reorganization as a nation===
In 1937, seizing the opportunity presented by the US [[Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act]] to regain tribal structure and self-government, the Wyandotte organized themselves into the Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma,<ref name="ohs"/> later changing their name to simply Wyandotte Nation, and achieved federal recognition.<ref>[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2008/pdf/E8-6968.pdf Federal Register, Volume 73, Number 66 dated April 4, 2008 (73 FR 18553).] pdf file (retrieved 26 Feb 2009)</ref> The act enabled Native Americans to hold property in common and to develop self-government and sovereignty.

===Wendat Confederacy===
In August 1999, the Wyandotte Nation joined the contemporary Wendat Confederacy, together with the Wyandot Nation of Kansas, Huron Wenday of Wendake (Quebec), and the Wyandot Nation of Anderdon in Michigan. The tribes pledged to provide mutual aid to each other in a spirit of peace, kinship, and unity.<ref>[http://www.wyandotte-nation.org/wendat_confederacy.html The Wendat Confederacy.] August 27, 1999, ''Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma.'' 2008 (retrieved 8 Feb 2009)</ref>  

This followed an important meeting of Huronia reconciliation in Midland, [[Ontario, Canada]], attended by representatives of the Iroquois Confederacy, Wyandotte nations, British, French, Dutch, Anglican Church and Catholic Jesuit Brothers. The weekend of events was organized by the Huronia Reconciliation Committee.<ref>[http://www.wyandot.org/reconciliation.htm Ed Pelletier, History Revisited by Descendants], Free Press Special, 25 Jun 1999, at Wyandot Nation of Kansas, accessed 26 Feb 2009</ref>
