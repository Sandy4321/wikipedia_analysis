'''''United States v. Ramsey''''', {{scite|271|467|1926}}, was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that the United States had the authority to prosecute crimes against Native Americans (Indians) on land that was on a reservation and that was still designated Indian Country by federal law.  The [[Osage Nation|Osage Indian Tribe]] held mineral rights that were worth millions of dollars.  A white rancher, [[William Hale (cattleman)|William K. Hale]], devised a plot to kill tribal members to allow his nephew, who was married to a tribal member, to inherit the mineral rights.  The tribe requested the assistance of the federal government, which sent Bureau of Investigation agents to solve the murders.  Hale and several others were arrested and tried for the murders and they claimed that the federal government did not have jurisdiction.  The district court quashed the indictments, but on appeal, the Supreme Court reversed, holding that the Osage lands were Indian Country and that the federal government therefore had jurisdiction.  This put an end to the [[Osage Indian murders]].

==Background==
===Federal law===
In 1834, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Nonintercourse Act|Indian Trade and Intercourse Act]]<ref>Indian Trade and Intercourse Act of 1834, June 30, 1834, chap. 161, <U+00A7> 25, {{USStat|4|733}}, amended by Act of Mar. 27, 1854, chap. 26,<U+00A7> 3, {{USStat|10|270}}, codified at R.S. <U+00A7> 2145; 1 {{smallcaps|Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties}} 18 (Charles J. Kappler ed. 1904).</ref> to regulate trade with the Indians and to provide the United States with criminal jurisdiction for crimes committed by or against Indians.  This law provided for trial in a federal court for crimes committed by an Indian against a non-Indian or by a non-Indian against an Indian.{{#tag:ref|It did not provide for Indian on Indian crimes until after 1885.  For more information on that subject, see ''[[Ex parte Crow Dog]]'' and [[Major Crimes Act]].|group=fn}}  At the time of passage, federal jurisdiction over the [[Indian Territory]] was given to the U.S. court in [[Arkansas]] and in 1851 this was clarified as the western district court in Arkansas.{{#tag:ref|At the time, this jurisdiction primarily affected non-Indians.  Indian on Indian crime was handled by the tribes until ''[[Ex parte Crow Dog]]'' led to the enactment of law giving federal courts jurisdiction over those crimes.<ref>{{smallcaps|Crooked Paths to Allotment: The Fight over Federal Indian Policy after the Civil War}} 1829-30 (C. Joseph Genetin-Pilawa ed. 2012).</ref>|group=fn}}<ref>Genetin-Pilawa, at 1830.</ref> In 1890, this law was amended to give the federal courts in western Arkansas, southern [[Kansas]], and eastern [[Texas]] jurisdiction over the Indian Territory at the same time it created the [[Oklahoma Territory]].{{#tag:ref|The location of the murder for this case was in the Oklahoma Territory section, in what is now Osage County.|group=fn}}<ref>Oklahoma Organic Act, May 2, 1890, chap. 182, {{USStat|26|81}}; Kappler at 51.</ref>

===Territory, statehood and allotment===

In 1870, the federal government purchased the [[Kansas]] reservation from the [[Osage Nation]].  The tribe then purchased 1,470,559 acres of land in the Indian Territory from the [[Cherokee Nation]].<ref>{{smallcaps|Donald Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|The Invasion of Indian Country in the Twentieth Century}} 28 (1998); {{smallcaps|Dennis McAuliffe}}, {{smallcaps|
Bloodland: A Family Story of Oil, Greed and Murder on the Osage Reservation}} 44-45 (1994).</ref>  The land was not suited for farming, but had abundant game.<ref>{{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 28-29.</ref>  In 1890 when Congress passed the [[Oklahoma Organic Act]] forming both the Oklahoma and Indian territories, the Osage Indian Reservation was part of the Oklahoma territory.{{#tag:ref|The Indian territory consisted of the land of the Five Civilized Tribes and several small tribes in the northeastern corner, while the Oklahoma territory consisted of all other land in present day Oklahoma.|group=fn}}  In 1887, Congress passed the [[Dawes Act]],<ref>Dawes Act of 1887, Feb. 8, 1887, chap. 119, {{USStat|24|388}}; Kappler at 33-36.</ref> which served to break up reservations and allot the land to tribal members.  The act did not apply to the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] or other tribes in the Indian territory nor to the Osage tribe in the Oklahoma territory.  In 1898 the [[Curtis Act of 1898|Curtis Act]]<ref>Curtis Act of 1898, June 28, 1898, chap. 517, {{USStat|30|495}} Kappler at 90-100.</ref> applied allotment to the Five Civilized Tribes, leaving the Osage tribe as the only tribe with a reservation in Oklahoma.<ref>{{smallcaps|Arlene B. Hirschfelder & Martha Kreipe de Monta<U+00F1>o}}, {{smallcaps|The Native American Almanac: A Portrait of Native America Today}} 294 (1998); {{smallcaps|McAuliffe}} at 220.</ref>

Under the provisions that Congress had established, Oklahoma could not become a state until all of the reservations were eliminated.<ref>{{smallcaps|McAuliffe}} at 46.</ref>  The Osage tribe, seeing the disastrous effects of allotment, resisted allotting their land until 1906.<ref>{{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 34.</ref>  At that time the tribe negotiated an allotment with the federal government that was different from the other allotments in two major respects. First, no Osage land would be opened up for white settlement as surplus land.<ref>{{smallcaps|McAuliffe}} at 47.</ref>  This was due to the fact that the tribe had purchased the land and had not been given the land by the government.<ref>{{smallcaps|McAuliffe}} at 47.</ref>  Second, mineral rights were retained by the tribe,{{#tag:ref|The tribe retained mineral rights for 20 years, until 1926, when they passed to whoever owned the land.<ref>{{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 35; {{smallcaps|McAuliffe}} at 220.</ref>|group=fn}} and not in a trust status through the federal government.<ref>{{smallcaps|McAuliffe}} at 47; Jon D.

This ownership of the land and mineral rights had another consequence.  In 1896 Edwin B. Foster signed an oil lease for the entire Osage reservation.<ref>{{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 30-31; Gerald Forbes, ''[http://web.archive.org/web/20130711204126/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v019/v019p070.html History of the Osage Blanket Lease]'', ''in'' 19 {{smallcaps|Chronicles of Oklahoma}} 70 (Mar. 1941) (archived from [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v019/v019p070.html original], July 11, 2013).</ref>  By 1902 Foster was shipping 37,000 barrels of oil and by 1906 his companies were producing over 5 million barrels annually.<ref>{{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 32; Forbes at 73.</ref>  The Osage tribe was one of the wealthiest in the United States, but with the mineral rights transferring to the land owners in 1926, they also became the most murdered people in the United States.<ref>{{smallcaps|McAuliffe}} at 220.</ref>  By 1925, Osage families were earning about $65,000 per year, compared to white families that were averaging $1,000.<ref>{{smallcaps|Donald Lee Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Bureau of Indian Affairs}} 101 (2012).</ref>  Congress also passed a law providing that an Osage Indian who was less than 1/2 blood, as determined by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], did not have to wait to sell his or her land.<ref>{{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 37.</ref>

In the early 1920s, Osage Indians who owned headrights, or land where they would obtain mineral rights began to be murdered<U+2014>the first two were Charles Whitehorn{{#tag:ref|Whitehorn was found on a hill near his hometown of Pawhuska with two bullet holes between the eyes.

===The trials===
Ernie Burkhart was tried first.  Two weeks into the trial, realizing that he could not win, he changed his plea to guilty and became a witness for the state in exchange for a life sentence.<ref>{{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 42-43; May.</ref>  Ernie Burkhart testified that Hale was behind the scheme, that Asa "Ace" Kirby was the bomber, and that Henry Grammer was the go-between.{{#tag:ref|'Coincidentally', both Kirby and Grammer had been killed before the trial.<ref>{{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 43; May.</ref>|group=fn}}

Hale and Ramsey were transferred to [[Guthrie, Oklahoma]] where they stood trial in state court for the murder of Roan in 1926.  The trial resulted in a hung-jury and a [[mistrial]].<ref>{{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 44.</ref>  The [[United States Attorney]] then transferred the case to [[Oklahoma City]] and indicted Hale and Ramsey for murder on federal land for the death of Roan.<ref>''United States v. Ramsey'', {{Ussc|271|467|1926|pin=468}}; {{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 44.</ref>  On being indicted both [[demurrer]]ed on the grounds that the federal government did not have jurisdiction.  The [[United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma|U.S. District Court]] sustained the defendants' motion and the government made a direct appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.<ref>''Ramsey'', 271 U.S. at 468.</ref>

==Opinion of the court==
[[File:Justice George Sutherland 5.jpg|left|thumb|px=100|alt=Justice Sutherland, author of the majority opinion|Justice Sutherland, author of the majority opinion]]
Justice [[George Sutherland]] delivered the opinion of the court.  Sutherland noted that the indictment was drawn under Revised Statute <U+00A7> 2145, which provides for federal jurisdiction of crimes committed in "Indian Country."<ref>''Ramsey'', 271 U.S. at 469.</ref>  This section is no longer applicable to general crimes in Oklahoma since statehood.  Crimes committed by or against Indians may still be prosecuted under <U+00A7> 2145 if the crime occurred in Indian Country.<ref>''Ramsey'', 271 U.S. at 469-70.</ref>  The question before the court is whether allotted land, with a restriction on sale by the Indian it was allotted to, is still Indian Country.  Since the government controls whether the land can be sold or otherwise alienated, it is no different from land held in trust and is therefore still Indian Country.<ref>''Ramsey'', 271 U.S. at 470-72.</ref>  The judgment of the district court was in error and is reversed.<ref>''Ramsey'', 271 U.S. at 472.</ref>

==Subsequent developments==
===Trial in U.S. District Court===
Following the decision of the Supreme Court, Hale, Burkhart, and Ramsey were tried in federal court.  Ernie Burkhart testified that Hale hired Ramsey to kill Roan.{{#tag:ref|The fee was a new Ford car and $500.<ref>{{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 45.</ref>|group=fn}}<ref>{{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 45.</ref>  Burkhart also testified to Hale's involvement in the Smith bombing, while Hale testified that he was in Fort Worth, Texas at the time of the killings.<ref>''Hale v. United States'', 25 F.2d 430, 440 (8th Cir. 1928); {{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 44.</ref>  All three defendants were convicted and sentenced to life in prison, within days both Hale and Ramsey appealed.<ref>{{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 44-45.</ref>

===Appeal===
Hale's appeal was heard first in 1928.  His appeal was based on improper procedure in admitting Burkhart's testimony as to the Smith bombing and again on the contention that the federal government did not have jurisdiction to try the case.<ref>''Hale'', 25 F.2d at 435, 440; {{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 45.</ref>  The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit Court]]{{#tag:ref|Oklahoma was part of the Eighth Circuit from statehood in 1907 until the Tenth Circuit was formed in 1929.<ref>''[http://web.archive.org/web/20100527100112/http://www.lb8.uscourts.gov/pubsandservices/histsociety/coa8_shorthist.html Short History of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]'', {{smallcaps|The Historical Society of the United States Courts

United States'', 33 F.2d 699 (8th Cir. 1929); {{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 45.</ref>

===Retrial===
In 1929, both Hale and Ramsey were retried for the murder.<ref>{{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 45-47.</ref>  Ramsey testified in court and explained how Hale hired him to kill Roan, but later changed his story to claim another person killed Roan.  Hale again testified that he had nothing to do with the crime.<ref>{{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 45-47.</ref>  Both were convicted and again sentenced to 99 years in prison.<ref>{{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 46; Stephey.</ref>

===Aftermath===
Hale entered the [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|Fort Leavenworth Federal Prison]] on May 30, 1929, and over the protests of the Osage tribe was paroled on July 31, 1947.<ref>{{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 47; May; Stephey.</ref>  Ramsey was paroled four months later.<ref>{{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 47; May.</ref>  Burkhart was released in October 1959.
<ref>{{smallcaps|Fixico}}, {{smallcaps|Invasion}} at 47; May.</ref>  Morrison was sentenced to life in prison in 1926 for Brown's murder.<ref>May.</ref>  In 1965, Governor [[Henry Bellmon]] granted Burkhart a full [[pardon]].<ref>May; Stephey.</ref>
