[[Shaivite]] scriptures relate that god [[Shiva]] assumed the [[avatar]] (incarnation) of Sharabha in order to tame [[Narasimha]], the fierce man-lion avatar of [[Vishnu]]. This manifestation is popularly known as '''Sharabeshwara''' ("Lord Sarabha") or '''Sharabeshwara-murti'''.<ref name= Waradpande>{{Cite book|last= Waradpande|first= N. R.|title= The mythical Aryans and their invasion|work=Sharabha|pages=43,46|accessdate=2010-01-09|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GR1uAAAAMAAJ&q=Sharabha&dq=Sharabha&ei=3zRFS4m2FIjKlQToibTrDQ&cd=8|publisher= Books & Books|year=2000|isbn=8185016577}}</ref> The tale usually ends with the defeat of Narasimha and Vishnu becoming a devotee of Shiva. Dynastic rulers of the [[Chola dynasty]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] contributed to promotion of the Shaivite cult by deifying Sharabha images in temples in Tamil Nadu in South India.

The [[Vaishnavite]]s refute the portrayal of Narasimha as being destroyed by Shiva-Sharabha and regard Sharabha as a name of Vishnu. Another tale narrates that Vishnu assumed the form of the ferocious [[Gandaberunda]] bird-animal to combat Sharabha. A broader philosophical interpretation of the use of the word Sharabha has also been provided by sages and scholars.

In [[Buddhism]], Sharabha appears in [[Jataka Tales]] as an earlier incarnation of  [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]]. It also appears in [[Tibetan Buddhist]] art, symbolizing  the perfection of effort. As a figure of power and majesty, Sharabha has appeared in numerous emblems, such as those of the [[Government of Karnataka|Karnataka government]], the [[University of Mysore]], and [[Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited]].

==Evolution of character and iconography==
In Sanskrit literature, Sharabha is initially described as an aggressive creature that roared and intimidated the other animals in the hills and forests. In the later epic [[Mahabharata]] this form of Sharabha is exaggerated as a lion-slaying monster with eight legs and eyes on the crown of its head; living in the mountain forest and feasting on raw flesh.<ref name= Hopkins/> It is also mentioned as residing on Mount [[Krauncha]] but not as a monster. However, other accounts minimise the monstrous nature of the creature and describe Sharabha as living as an ordinary beast along with lions and tigers on Mount [[Gandhamandana]]. The Mahabharata cites the Sharabha in the list of edible animals, known as the ''mrigajatis'', an animal group consisting of antelope, deer, hare, bear, ruru deer, sambar, gayal, boar, and buffalo which were commonly served to dinner guests. In the epic [[Ramayana]], Sharabha appears as a name of monkey-king, and a name of heroes, apes, demons ([[danava]]s), [[N<U+0101>ga]]s and one of the names of [[Vishnu]] and the [[Buddha]]. Similes in Sanskrit literature often equate warriors to Sharabha.<ref name= Hopkins>{{Cite book|last= Hopkins |first= E.

===Shiva's incarnation===
In [[Puranas|Puranic literature]], the god [[Shiva]] is said to appear as Sharabha in order to subdue the fierce manifestations of Vishnu. The legend of Sharabha fighting [[Narasimha]], the man-lion form of Vishnu, brings to fore the overt rivalry between the devotees of Vishnu ([[Vaishnavite]] sect) and those of Shiva ([[Shaivite]] sect).<ref name=Pattanaik/><ref name= Blurton>{{Cite book|last= Blurton|first= T. Richard|title= Hindu art|pages=239|work=Sharabha|page=123|accessdate=2009-01-09|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=xJ-lzU_nj_MC&pg=PA123&dq=Sharabha&lr=&ei=JzxFS8HnL4jKlQToibTrDQ&cd=37#v=onepage&q=Sharabha&f=false|publisher= Harvard University Press|year= 1993|isbn=0674391896}}</ref> According to Janmajit Roy, the Narasimha-Sharabha encounter may be a Shaivite version of [[Vedas|Vedic]] tale of Vishnu piercing the boar, something also related in the ''[[Kalika Purana]]'' account which mentions Shiva as Sharabha subduing [[Varaha]], the boar form of Vishnu. <ref name= Roy >{{Cite book|last= Roy |first= Janmajit |title= Bhagavata Purana |pages=93<U+2013>95|accessdate=2010-01-15|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=lr9pFQPwhXYC&pg=PA93&dq=Varaha+sarabha&as_brr=3&client=firefox-a&cd=4#v=onepage&q=Varaha%20sarabha&f=false|publisher= Atlantic Publishers & Distributors |year=2002|isbn=8126901691}}</ref> It describes Sharabha as having an enormous body and being black in colour, with four feet facing downwards and four feet uplifted. Sharabha is said to have a long face and nose, nails eight tusks, a cluster of manes, and a long tail. Further, Sharabha is described to jump high repeatedly making a loud cry.<ref name= Roy/><ref name= Shastri/> ''[[Shiva Purana]]'' describes Sharabha as lion-faced, with matted hair, wings and eight feet, and a thousand arms.<ref name=Pattanaik/><ref name = "Knipe"/> ''Sharabha [[Upanishad]]'' portrays Sharabha with two heads, two wings, and eight lion-legs with sharp claws and a long tail.<ref name= Rao/> 

The iconography of Sharabeshwaramurti (Shiva as Sarabha) is specifically defined in texts such as ''[[Khamikagama]]'' and ''[[Sritattvanidhi]]''. In Khamikagama, Sharabha is described in the form of a golden bird, with two uplifted wings, two red eyes, four legs in the form of a lion touching the ground, four legs with upwards facing claws, and with an animal tail. The top part of the body is human but possesses a lion's face and an ornamented crown with side tusks. It also shows the Narasimha beneath Sharabha<U+2019>s legs as a lion-faced human with ''[[anjali]]'' (hands folded prayer gesture). (See Infobox image)<ref name= "Rao p.172-173">Rao pp.172<U+2013>173</ref>

In the iconographic treatise ''Sritattvanidhi'', the Sharabeshwaramurti is described as having thirty arms, with its arms on the right holding a [[Vajra|thunderbolt]], mushti, abhaya, [[chakra]] (discus), sakti, [[danda|staff]], [[ankusha|goad]], sword, [[Khatvanga]] ("skull-staff"), [[parashu|axe]], akshamala, a bone, bow, musala, and fire, and its left arms carrying a noose, varada, [[gada|mace]], arrow, flag, and another type of sword, a snake, a lotus flower, [[kapala|skull-cup]], pustaka, plough, and mrudanga with one hand encircling [[Durga]] in a hug. This form is said to bring good luck, cure all diseases and destroy all enemies.<ref name= "Rao p.173">Rao p.173</ref>

The [[Chola dynasty]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] was well-documented as following the Shaiva cult. This is evident from the four Sharabha images, the earliest being that at the Vikramsolishwaram temple near Kumbakonam, built by [[Vikrama Chola]] (1118<U+2013>35). The other images are at [[Darasuram]] and the Kampahareshvarar temple of [[Tribhuvanam]] which was built by the last Chola ruler, [[Kulottunga Chola III]], and where Sharabha's image is housed in a separate shrine.<ref name= Smith >{{Cite book|last= Smith |first= David |title= The Dance of Siva: Religion, Art and Poetry in South India: Volume 7 of Cambridge Studies in Religious Traditions|page=193|accessdate=2010-01-15|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=fTLlcGlkdjkC&pg=PA191&dq=sarabha&lr=&as_brr=3&client=firefox-a&cd=13#v=onepage&q=sarabha&f=false|publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0521528658}}</ref>

A sculpture of Sharbeshwaramurti in the Tribhuvanam temple, a Shiva temple in [[Tanjore district]], in Tamil Nadu, is depicted with three legs, with the body and face of a lion and tail. However, it has four human arms, the right upper hand holding an axe, the right lower hand holding a noose, the left upper hand holding a deer and the left lower hand holding fire. Narasimha is shown with eight arms, flaying and struggling under Sharbeshwaramurti<U+2019>s feet.<ref name= "Rao p.174">Rao p.174</ref> In the [[Airavatesvara Temple]] at Darasuram, a rare black basalt image of the Chola period depicts Shiva as Sharabha, deified in an exclusive small shrine as being part man, beast and bird, and destroying Narasimha, the man-lion incarnation of Vishnu. This demonstrates the hostility between the Shaivite and Vaishnavite cults.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cc.bingj.com/cache.aspx?q=sharabha&d=4989300354253554&mkt=en-IN&setlang=en-US&w=792f2221,c607bd25|title= Temples in Kumbakonam: Airavateshwara temple at Darasuram (near Kumbakonam)|accessdate=2010-01-09}}</ref> In the [[Chennakeshava temple]] of [[Belur]], [[Karnataka]], built in 1113, [[Gandaberunda]], the two-faced bird identified with Vishnu appears in a carved scene of animal mutilation.

The lion is then shown as being devoured by Sharabha, with the last scene depicting Gandaberunda destroying Sharabha.<ref name=Kamat>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kamat.com/jyotsna/blog/blog.php?BlogID=1149|title=Gandaberunda- The Two Headed Bird|accessdate=2010-01-10|publisher=Kamat Potpourri}}</ref>

In iconographic representations of the myth of Shiva vis-<U+00E0>-vis Vishnu, Sharabha form has been built around Narasimha but substantially embellished with wings to represent [[Kali]] and [[Durga]] to denote the female powers ([[shakti]]s) of Shiva. Sharabha is also shown with the head of a bird and a serpent in his beak.<ref name= Kramrisch>{{Cite book|last= Kramrisch|first= Stella|title= The Presence of Siva|page=436|accessdate=2010-01-15|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=O5BanndcIgUC&pg=PA436&dq=sarabha&lr=&as_brr=3&client=firefox-a&cd=24#v=onepage&q=sarabha&f=false|publisher= Princeton University Press|year=1994|isbn=0691019304}}</ref>

===In Mahabharata===
The Hindu epic, [[Mahabharata]], mentions nothing of Shiva to Sharabha. It tells the story of a dog, who with the help of a [[Rishi]] (sage), assumes various animal forms. First, the dog manifests as a tiger, followed by an elephant and a lion and finally a sharabha, who terrorizes every one in the hermitage of the Rishi. Eventually, as his strength grows, Sharabha becomes wilder and attempts to devour the Rishi himself. The Rishi subsequently curses Sharabha and demotes him to his original form of a dog.<ref name= Ganguli >{{Cite book|last= Ganguli |first= Kisari Mohan |title= The Mahabharata of Krishna-dwaipayana Vyasa, Book-12 |pages=347<U+2013>348|accessdate=2010-01-15|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CnQVCgtmW-sC&pg=PA348&dq=sarabha&lr=&as_brr=3&client=firefox-a&cd=12#v=onepage&q=sarabha&f=false|publisher= BiblioBazaar, LLC |year=2009|isbn=0559137133}}</ref>

===Shaivite views===
The legend of Sharabha as an incarnation of Shiva is narrated in many Hindu scriptures, although the exact narration is often subject to variation to adhere to particular religious beliefs. However, it is mandatory to all accounts that Sharabha is described as being a massive animal-bird beast with enormous strength, which manifested itself with the purpose to tame the avatars of Vishnu such as [[Narasimha]] (man-lion) or [[Varaha]] (the boar). The Narasimha-Sharabha legend is generally linked to gods assuming mythical animal forms with the purpose to slay or subdue. 

In the ''[[Shiva Purana]]'', Vishnu is said to assume the form of Narasimha to slay [[Hiranyakashipu]], an [[asura]] (demon) king, who terrorized the universe and devotees of Shiva.<ref name=Pattanaik/><ref name= Blurton/>

When that failed, Shiva manifested as the human-lion-bird Sharabha. Shiva then assumed the Sharabha form. Sharabha then attacked Narasimha and seized him up until he was immobilized.

The [[Skanda Purana]] considers Narasimha as a mere irritation and not a threat to the world, contrary to what was brought out in the Shiva and Linga Puranas. The perception was that Vishnu may permanently adopt the fierce form of Narasimha, which would be detrimental to his role of doing good deeds. Hence, the purpose of Shiva assuming the form of Sharabha was to ensure that he returned to his original divine form. Narasimha is said to have struck Sharabha with his body, but it was Vishnu who groaned in pain, rather than Sharabha who had endured the blow, being in an "adamantine body". At that moment, Vishnu realised that Sharabha was none other than Shiva and bowed down and praised Sharabha.

Vaishnavite followers, notably [[Dvaita]] scholars such as [[Vijayindra Tirtha]] (1539<U+2013>95), refute the portrayal of Narasimha as being destroyed by Sharabha as they consider the Shaivite Puranas as [[tamasic]] with little credibility, based upon their reading and understanding of the [[Puranas|Sattvic Puranas]] and [[Shruti]] texts. The dismissal of the Sharabha legend along with ten other Shaivite legends is discussed in a text by Vijayindra Tirtha called ''Shaivasarvasvakhandanam''.<ref>Vijayindra Tirtha argues that the legend of Narasimha being destroyed by Sharabha was contrary to the established superiority of the Sattvic puranas over all others and that Shiva was not greater than Vishnu.</ref><ref name= Sharma>{{cite book|last=Sharma|first= B.

In the [[Jataka tales]] of the Buddha's previous lives, Buddha was said to have been born as a  [[Boddhisattva]] in a forest as the eight-legged deer. The king, while trying to hunt Sharabha is said to have falling into a precipice with his horse. The deer, instead of abandoning the king to his fate, rescued him. The king was deeply touched by the compassion shown by the deer and thereafter promulgated a decry stating that hunting was an illegal activity in his country.<ref name=Himalaya>{{Cite web|url=http://www.himalayanart.org/image.cfm/50215.html|title= Shakyamuni Buddha <U+2013> Jataka (previous lives)|accessdate=2010-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The J<U+0101>taka or stories of the Buddha's former births|editor=Edward Byles Cowell|publisher=Asian Educational Services|volume=4|pages=166<U+2013>74|chapter=Sarabha-Miga-Jataka|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tyzjqrJ2YnwC&pg=PA166&dq=sarabha&lr=&as_brr=3&client=firefox-a&cd=3#v=onepage&q=sarabha&f=false}}</ref>

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], Sharabha is represented as a beast with a goat's head and horns, a lion's mane and horse's body and legs. It symbolises determination, strength and speed. Sometimes, it is depicted additionally with the horns of an antelope and claws of an eagle. Sometimes, the goat head is replaced by a lion's, horse's feet by a lion's and horns can be of a ram. A common feature of all representations is the horse's body. It is often depicted as mounts of young [[Deva (Buddhism)|Devas]] or dwarfs in a ''[[Torana]]'' <U+2013> a six-level archway behind an enlightenment throne of a Buddha or [[Boddhisattva]]. Together with the devas, they symbolize the perfection of effort (virya).<ref>{{cite book|last=Robert Be<U+00E9>r|title=The encyclopedia of Tibetan symbols and motifs|publisher=Serindia Publications, Inc.|pages=80,90|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XlqeS3WjSWIC&pg=PA90&dq=sharabha&as_brr=3&client=firefox-a&cd=1#v=onepage&q=sharabha&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last= Robert Beer|title=The handbook of Tibetan Buddhist symbols |publisher=Serindia Publications, Inc.|pages=259|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-3804Ud9-4IC&pg=PA259&dq=sharabha&as_brr=3&client=firefox-a&cd=7#v=onepage&q=sharabha&f=false}}</ref>
