The '''XY sex-determination system''' is the [[sex-determination system]] found in [[human]]s, most other [[mammal]]s, some insects (''[[Drosophila]]'') and some plants (''[[Ginkgo]]'').  In the XY sex-determination system, females have two of the same kind of [[sex]] [[chromosome]] (XX), and are called the [[homogametic]] sex.  Males have two distinct sex chromosomes (XY), and are called the heterogametic sex.

The XY sex determination system was first described independently by [[Nettie Stevens]] and [[Edmund Beecher Wilson]] in [[1905]].

==Mechanisms==
Some species (including most mammals) have a [[gene]] or genes on the [[Y chromosome]] that determine maleness.  In the case of humans, a single gene (''[[SRY]]'') on the Y chromosome acts as a signal to set the developmental pathway towards maleness.<ref>{{cite journal  | author=Haqq CM, King CY, Ukiyama E, ''et al.'' |title=Molecular basis of mammalian sexual determination: activation of M<U+00FC>llerian inhibiting substance gene expression by SRY. |journal=Science |volume=266 |issue= 5190 |pages= 1494-500 |year= 1995 |pmid= 7985018}}</ref>  Other mammals use several genes on the Y chromosome for that same purpose.  Not all male-specific genes are located on the Y chromosome.

Other species (including most ''[[Drosophila]]'' species) use the presence of two [[X chromosome]]s to determine femaleness.  One X chromosome gives putative maleness.  The presence of Y chromosome genes are required for normal male development.

Humans, as well as some other organisms, can have a chromosomal arrangement that is contrary to their phenotypic sex, that is, XY males or XX females.  See, for example, [[XX male syndrome]] and [[Androgen insensitivity syndrome]].
