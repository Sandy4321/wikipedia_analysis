'''Robert Craggs-Nugent, 1st Earl Nugent''' [[Privy Council of Great Britain|PC]] (1702 <U+2013> 13 October 1788) was an Irish politician and poet.

==Background==
The son of Michael Nugent and Mary, daughter of Robert Barnewall, 9th Baron Trimlestown, he was born at [[Carlanstown]], [[County Westmeath]]. He succeeded his father in the Carlanstown property on 13 May 1739.

==Political career==
His wife's property included the borough of [[St Mawes (UK Parliament constituency)|St Mawes]] in Cornwall, and Nugent sat for [[St Mawes (constituency)|that constituency]] from 1741 to 1754, after which date he represented [[Bristol (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol]] until 1774, when he returned to St Mawes. In 1747 he succeeded [[Arthur Mohun St Leger, 3rd Viscount Doneraile|Lord Doneraile]] as Comptroller of the Household to [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|the Prince of Wales]]. Nugent lent the Prince large sums of money, which were never repaid; the appointments and peerages he received later in life have been attributed to the wish of the Prince of Wales's son, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], to compensate Nugent.

Robert Craggs-Nugent, as he then was, served as a [[Lord of the Treasury]] from 1754 to 1759, and was made a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]] in 15 December 1759. He was [[Vice-Treasurer of Ireland]] from 1759 to 1765, [[First Lord of Trade]] from 1766 to 1768, and Vice-Treasurer of Ireland again from 1768 to 1782. In 1768 he was made a member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland|Irish Privy Council]]. His support of the ministry was so useful that he was created in 1767 '''Baron Nugent''' and '''Viscount Clare''', and in 1776 [[Earl Nugent]], all Irish peerages.

Apart from his political career Lord Nugent was also the author of some poetical productions, several of which are preserved in the second volume of [[Robert Dodsley|Dodsley]]'s ''Collections'' (1748).

==Family==
Lord Nugent married firstly, on 14 July 1730, Emilia (died in childbirth 16 August 1731), daughter of the [[Peter Plunkett, 4th Earl of Fingall|fourth Earl of Fingall]]. They had one son, Edmund, who became a [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] and the father of two illegitimate sons (later [[Field Marshal]]) [[Sir George Nugent, 1st Baronet]], and [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] [[Charles Edmund Nugent|Sir Charles Edmund Nugent]]) before dying in 1771. Nugent married secondly, on 23 March 1736, Anna (died 22 November 1756), daughter of [[James Craggs the Elder|James Craggs]] and sister of the Right Honourable [[James Craggs the Younger|James Craggs]], the secretary of state, whereupon Robert Nugent adopted the surname of '''Craggs-Nugent'''. She had already been twice given in marriage, but Robert, who was born a Roman Catholic, had abandoned his Church very early in life. (He was tersely described by [[Richard Glover]] as a jovial and voluptuous Irishman who had left popery for the Protestant religion, money and widows.) He married in 2 January 1757 Elizabeth (died 29 January 1792), widow of the [[Augustus Berkeley, 4th Earl of Berkeley|fourth Earl of Berkeley]], who brought him a large fortune.

The earldom descended by special remainder to the earl's son-in-law, [[George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham]], and so to his successors, the [[Duke of Buckingham|dukes of Buckingham and Chandos]].
