'''Scott Island''' ({{coor dm|67|24|S|179|55|W|}}) is a small uninhabited [[island]] of volcanic origin in the [[Southern Ocean]], 505 km northeast of [[Cape Adare]], the northeastern extremity of [[Victoria Land]]. It is 370 metres long and 180 m wide, covering an area of 0.4 km<U+00B2>. West of the island by 250m is [[Haggitt's Pillar]], a stack reaching over 60m. The island has two small coves with beaches, the rest of the island being surrounded by high cliffs. One of the coves is on the northeastern coast and the other opposite Haggitt's Pillar on the western coast of the island.

The island was discovered on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] [[1902]] and landed upon by Captain William Colbeck commander of the ''[[SY Morning|Morning]]'', relief ship for Captain [[Robert Falcon Scott|Robert F. Scott]]'s expedition. Colbeck originally planned to name the island Markham Island, after Sir [[Clements Markham]] but later decided to name it after Captain Scott. Haggitt's Pillar is named after William Colbeck's mother's family name, Haggitt.

It is part of the [[Ross Dependency]], claimed by [[New Zealand]] (see claims on [[Antarctica]]).
