'''Gregory John Retallack''' (born November 8, 1951) is an Australian paleontologist, geologist, and author who specializes in the study of fossil soils ([[paleopedology]]). His research has examined the fossil record of soils though major events in Earth history, extending back some 4.6 billion years.<ref>{{cite book|title=Soils of the past: an introduction to paleopedology|publisher=Blackwell|author=Retallack, G.

== Biography ==

Retallack moved with his family from [[Hobart, Tasmania]] at age 4. He grew up in [[Hurstville, New South Wales|Hurstville]] and then [[Epping, New South Wales|Epping]], in the suburbs of [[Sydney, New South Wales]]. He attended the [[The King's School, Parramatta]], then studied biology and paleontology at [[Macquarie University]]. He received a BSc Hons with University Medal in 1974 from the [[University of New England (Australia)]] and a Ph.D. in 1978 in geology from the same university. After a postdoctoral fellowship at [[Indiana University]] he joined the faculty at the [[University of Oregon]] in 1981. He has been a professor in the Department of Geological Sciences since 1992, and Director of the Condon Collection of the [[University of Oregon Museum of Natural and Cultural History]] since 2009.

In 1973,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Stratigraphy, palaeobotany and environmental analysis of an area around Pittwater, north of Sydney, N.S.W.|journal=BSc Honours thesis, University of New England|author=Retallack, G.

=== Archeology ===

In a study of soils at 84 temples of [[Classical Greece]], Retallack discovered that each deity and cult was associated with a particular kind of soil, suggesting an economic basis for Greek polytheism.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Rocks, views, soils and plants at the temples of ancient Greece | author=Retallack, G.

== Boards ==

Retallack has served as an associate or technical editor for such scientific journals as ''[[Geology]]'', ''[[PALAIOS]]'', and ''[[Journal of Sedimentary Research]]''. His fellowships include the [[Geological Society of America]], and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].

He served as the president and vice president of the Cordilleran Section of the [[Paleontological Society]], of the Oregon Academy of Sciences,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.pdx.edu|title=The Oregon Academy of Science|publisher=Oregon Academy of Science|accessdate=August 21, 2013}}</ref> and of the University of Oregon Chapter of the Society of [[Sigma Xi]].

== Critical reception ==

Early reviews of Retallack's textbooks have been positive. Of ''Soils of the Past'', David Fastovsky<ref>{{cite journal | title=Book Reviews | author=Fastovsky, D. E. | journal=Sedimentology | year=1991| volume=38| pages=181<U+2013>184}}</ref>  concludes "it is requisite for all persons trying to understand paleosols". Of ''A Colour Guide to Paleosols'', Daniel Yaalon<ref>{{cite journal | title=Book Review | author=Yaalon, D.

Both reviews however baulked at the unfamiliarity of soil science terminology and classification in these texts.

Retallack's approach to the description and interpretation of paleosols has been adopted.<ref name="Driese-2013">

Retallack has been honored for his research, including the Stillwell Award of the Geological Society of Australia, for best paper in the society journal in 1977, and the ''[[Antarctica Service Medal]]'' of the U.S. National Science Foundation in 1999.{{fact|date=September 2013}}  He has been an invited lecturer throughout the U.S., and also to Germany, England, China, Thailand and India.
