'''''Banksia attenuata''''', commonly known as the '''candlestick banksia''' or '''slender banksia''', is a [[species]] of [[plant]]  in the [[proteaceae]] family. Commonly a tree, it reaches 10&nbsp;m (35&nbsp;ft) high, but is often a [[shrub]] in dryer areas 1 or 2&nbsp;m (3<U+2013>7&nbsp;ft) high. It has long narrow serrated leaves and  bright yellow [[inflorescence]]s, or flower spikes, held above the foliage, which appear in spring and summer. The flower spikes age to grey and swell with the development of the woody [[follicle (fruit)|follicles]]. It is found across much of the [[southwest Australia|southwest]] of [[Western Australia]], from north of [[Kalbarri National Park]] down to [[Cape Leeuwin]] and across to [[Fitzgerald River National Park]]. 

[[John Lindley]] had named material collected by [[James Drummond (botanist)|James Drummond]] ''Banksia cylindrostachya'' in 1840, but this proved to be the same as the species named ''Banksia attenuata'' by [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] 30 years earlier in 1810, and thus Brown's name took precedence.

The candlestick banksia is pollinated by and provides food for a wide array of vertebrate and invertebrate animals in summer months. It regenerates from [[bushfire]] by regrowing from its woody base known as a [[lignotuber]], or from [[epicormic bud]]s within its trunk. It has been widely used as a street tree and [[amenity|amenities]] planting in urban Western Australia, though its large size generally precludes use in small gardens. A dwarf form is commercially available in nurseries.

''Banksia attenuata'' is generally encountered as a tree up to 10&nbsp;m (35&nbsp;ft) tall. In the north of its range as the climate becomes warmer and dryer, it is often a stunted multistemmed [[shrub]] 0.4 to 2&nbsp;m (1<U+2013>7&nbsp;ft) tall.

{{see also|Taxonomy of Banksia}}
''Banksia attenuata'' was first collected by [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] from [[King George Sound]] in December 1801, and published by him in 1810. The [[species name]] is the [[Latin]] adjective ''attenuatus'' "narrowed", and refers to the leaves narrowing towards the base.<ref name="George96">{{cite book|last=George|first=Alex S.|title=The Banksia Book|edition=3rd|year=1996|publisher=Kangaroo Press|location=Kenthurst, New South Wales|isbn=0-86417-818-2|page=133}}</ref> The species has had a fairly uneventful [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] history. It has only two synonyms, and no [[subspecies]] or [[variety (botany)|varieties]] have been published;<ref name="APNI 52773">{{APNI | name = ''Banksia attenuata'' R.Br. | id = 52773}}</ref>  George reviewed the variation in form in the species, and felt tree and shrub forms differed only in size and hence were not distinct enough to represent separate taxa.<ref name="George81"/> In 1840, [[John Lindley]] published a putative new species, ''Banksia cylindrostachya'', in his ''[[A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony]]''; this has now be shown to be a [[taxonomic synonym]] of ''B.&nbsp;attenuata''.<ref name="APNI 53299">{{APNI | name = ''Banksia cylindrostachya'' Lindl. | id = 53299}}</ref> In 1891, [[Otto Kuntze]] made a failed attempt to transfer ''Banksia'' to the new generic name ''Sirmuellera''. In the process he published the name ''Sirmuellera attenuata'', which is now considered a [[nomenclatural synonym]] of ''B.&nbsp;attenuata''.<ref name="APNI 22776">{{APNI | name = ''Sirmuellera attenuata'' (R.Br.) Kuntze | id = 22776}}</ref> [[Common name]]s include slender banksia, candle banksia and candlestick banksia. ''Piara'' (alternately spelled ''biara'') is an [[Australian Aborigines|aboriginal]] name from the [[Melville, Western Australia|Melville]] region of Perth.

The relationships of ''Banksia attenuata'' within the genus are unclear. When [[Carl Meissner]] published [[Meissner's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia|his infrageneric arrangement]] of ''Banksia'' in 1856, he placed ''B.&nbsp;attenuata'' in section [[Banksia sect. Eubanksia|''Eubanksia'']] because its inflorescence is a spike rather than a domed head, and in series [[Banksia ser. Salicinae|''Salicinae'']],<ref name="Meissner 1856">{{cite encyclopedia |author=Meissner, Carl |year=1856 |chapter=Proteaceae |editor=[[A. P. de Candolle|de Candolle, A.

Cyrtostylis|''Cyrtostylis'']], a group of species which did not fit easily into one of the other sections.<ref name="Bentham 1870">{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Bentham |first1=George |year=1870 |title=Banksia |encyclopedia=[[Flora Australiensis]] |volume=5 |pages=541<U+2013>62 |location=London |publisher=L. Reeve & Co}}</ref>

In 1981, [[Alex George]] published a revised arrangement that placed ''B.&nbsp;attenuata'' in the subgenus [[Banksia subg. Banksia|''Banksia'']] because of its flower spike, section [[Banksia sect. Banksia|''Banksia'']] because its [[pistil|styles]] are straight rather than hooked, and the series [[Banksia ser. Cyrtostylis|''Cyrtostylis'']], a large and rather heterogenous series of twelve species. He conceded its large emarginate [[cotyledon]]s (having a notch in their apex) were quite different from other members, and that it had similarities in flower architecture to another anomalous member ''[[Banksia elegans|B.&nbsp;elegans]]''. He felt ''B.&nbsp;attenuata'' to have affinities to ''[[Banksia lindleyana|B.&nbsp;lindleyana]]'' and ''[[Banksia media|B.&nbsp;media]]''.<ref name="George81"/>

George's arrangement remained current until 1996, when [[Kevin Thiele]] and [[Pauline Ladiges]] published an [[Thiele and Ladiges' taxonomic arrangement of Banksia|arrangement]] informed by a [[cladistics|cladistic]] analysis of [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics. They calculated ''B. attenuata'' to lie at the base of a large ''B. attenuata'' <U+2013> ''B.ashbyi'' [[clade]], but conceded further work was needed before its relationships could be determined, and left it as ''incertae sedis''.<ref name="Thiele 1996">{{cite journal |last1=Thiele |first1=Kevin |last2=Ladiges |first2=Pauline Y. |year=1996 |title=A cladistic analysis of ''Banksia'' (Proteaceae) |journal=[[Australian Systematic Botany]] |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=661<U+2013>733 |doi=10.1071/SB9960661}}</ref> Questioning the emphasis on cladistics in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement, George published a slightly modified version of his 1981 arrangement in his 1999 treatment of ''Banksia'' for the ''[[Flora of Australia (series)|Flora of Australia]]'' series of [[monograph]]s.

Since 1998, American botanist [[Austin Mast]] and co-authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of [[DNA sequence]] data for the subtribe [[Grevilleoideae|Banksiinae]], which then comprised genera ''Banksia'' and ''[[Banksia ser. Dryandra|Dryandra]]''. Their analyses suggest a [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]] that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. ''Banksia attenuata'' resolves as a [[basal clade|basal]] member of and next closest relative, or 'sister', to a clade containing ''B.&nbsp;elegans'' and, within that, a [[monophyly|monophyletic]] ''B.''&nbsp;subg.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:B attentuata dist map.png|thumb|left|Distribution of ''B. attentuata'']]
The most widely distributed of all western banksias, ''Banksia attenuata'' occurs across a broad swathe of [[southwest Australia|southwest]] of [[Western Australia]], from [[Kalbarri National Park]] and the [[Murchison River]] (with an outlying population in [[Zuytdorp National Park]]) southwards right to the southwestern corner of the state at [[Augusta, Western Australia|Augusta]] and  [[Cape Leeuwin]], and then eastwards across the south to the western edge of  [[Fitzgerald River National Park]]. Along the eastern border northwards it is found at [[Lake Grace]], Lake Magenta north of [[Jerramungup, Western Australia|Jerramungup]], and the [[Wongan Hills]]. It is restricted to various sandy soils, white, yellow or brown sands, sand over [[laterite]] or [[limestone]], and forms an important component of open ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' woodland as a dominant or [[understory]] tree or tall shrub. To the north, it is a shrubby component of [[shrubland]]. It does not grow on heavy (clay-based) soils, and is hence only found in sandy pockets.<ref name=atlas/> Within open woodland, it is found alongside ''[[Banksia menziesii|B.&nbsp;menziesii]]'', ''[[Banksia ilicifolia|B.&nbsp;ilicifolia]]'', ''[[Banksia prionotes|B.&nbsp;prionotes]]'', ''[[Allocasuarina fraseriana]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus marginata]]'', or ''[[Eucalyptus gomphocephala|E.&nbsp;gomphocephala]]''.<ref name = "George81"/> The annual rainfall within its distribution varies from 300 to 900&nbsp;mm (12<U+2013>36&nbsp;in).<ref name=collins09/>

==Ecology==
[[File:Banksia attenuata resprouter.jpg|thumb|right|Resprouting after fire]]
Like many plants in [[south-west Western Australia]], ''B.&nbsp;attenuata'' is adapted to an environment in which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most ''Banksia'' species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: ''reseeders'' are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their [[canopy seed bank]], thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; ''[[resprouter]]s'' survive fire, resprouting from a [[lignotuber]] or, more rarely, [[Epicormic shoot|epicormic buds]] protected by thick bark.<ref name="Lamont 1995">{{cite journal |last1=Lamont |first=Byron B. |last2=Markey |first2=Adrienne |year=1995 |title=Biogeography of fire-killed and resprouting ''Banksia'' species in South-western Australia |journal=Australian Journal of Botany |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=283<U+2013>303 |doi=10.1071/BT9950283}}</ref> Bearing epicormic buds and a lignotuber, ''B.&nbsp;attenuata'' is one of the latter group, with follicles that may open spontaneously or by fire.<ref name="George81"/> It is moderately [[serotiny|serotinous]], storing only one tenth the number of seeds in its seed bank as the reseeding ''B.&bnsp;hookeriana'' which it coexists with on sand dunes in scrub at [[Eneabba, Western Australia|Eneabba]] north of Perth.

Cones that had been exposed to water for more weeks had more seed released from follicles over time; around 40% released at 3&nbsp;weeks, increasing steadily to almost 90% at 10&nbsp;weeks, compared with a series of [[scientific control|controls]] (which were kept dry) of which fewer than 10% of seed released. Thus, the seed remains in the follicles until successive rains result in seed dispersal in the wetter winter (instead of dryer summer), increasing the chance of survival. After the follicle is split, the seed and separator are exposed to the elements. The wings of the woody separator are [[hygroscopic]], and move together when wet, and spread and curl apart when dry. The seed is gradually drawn out by the movement with each wetting.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cowling, Richard M.; Lamont, Byron B.|year=1985|title=Seed release in ''Banksia'': the role of wet-dry cycles |journal=Australian Journal of Ecology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=169<U+2013>71 |doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.1985.tb00878.x}}</ref> Once released, seed germinates at temperatures between 15 and 20&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (60<U+2013>70&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) to optimise timing with autumn and winter rains and hence maximise chance of survival.

Placed against its rivals, ''B.&nbsp;attenuata'' would be dominant between 8 and 10 or 11&nbsp;years, but at longer intervals is outcompeted by ''B.&nbsp;hookeriana''.

Despite having relatively heavy seed, seed from ''Banksia attenuata'' has a high rate of long distance dispersal. A genetic study of populations in Eneabba showed that over 5% of plants had originated up to 2.6&nbsp;km away (similar rates to ''Banksia hookeriana'', the seed of which only weighs half as much). The mechanism for this is unclear, although Byron Lamont has proposed the [[Short-billed Black Cockatoo]] (''Calyptorhynchus latirostris'') as a [[dispersal vector|vector]]; the species seeks out ''Banksia attenuata'' cones after bushfire, possibly because the large seeds and greater chance of grubs in the cone make them more nutritious.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Long-distance dispersal of seeds in the fire-tolerant shrub ''Banksia attenuata'' |author=He, Tianhua; Lamont, Byron B.; Krauss, Siegfried L.; Enright, Neal J.; Miller Ben P. |journal=Ecography| volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=571<U+2013>80 |year=2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0587.2008.05689.x}}</ref> Flowering has been recorded one to two years after a bushfire.<ref name=atlas/>

Like many members of the family Proteaceae, ''Banksia attenuata'' is an obligate [[outcrossing]] species. [[Self-incompatibility in plants|Self-incompatible]], inflorescences require pollinators to be fertilised and produce seed.

A 1978 field study conducted around [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] found the [[honey possum]] (''Tarsipes rostratus'') was a major pollinator of ''Banksia attenuata'', both feeding directly on the pollen and drinking the nectar. The flower structure is suited to passing pollen onto the possum as it feeds, unlike honeyeaters whose bills are too long for this to occur readily. Coupled with the flower spike's musky odour, these findings suggest ''Banksia attenuata'' is highly adapted to be pollinated primarily by this mammal species.<ref name=Weins79>{{cite journal|author=Weins, Delbert; Renfree, Marilyn; Wooller, Ronald D. |year=1979 |title=Pollen loads of Honey possums (''Tarsipes spencerae'') and non-flying mammal pollination in South-western Australia |journal=Annals of the Missouri Botanic Gardens|volume=66|pages=830<U+2013>38 |url=http://www.botanicus.org/item/31753003566442 |accessdate=24 November 2010}}</ref> Furthermore, Petroc Sumner and colleagues have investigated the [[Cone cell|cone]] [[photoreceptor cell]]s of honey possums and compared them with the colour changes of ''B.&nbsp;attenuata''. They found that the possum is trichromatic (like humans and possibly many marsupials) and propose that its  L (long wavelength) cones help it discern ''B.&nbsp;attenuata'' flower spikes, and the M (or medium wavelength) cones could help it distinguish ripe inflorescences with nectar from recently finished spikes (a difficult task for human vision).<ref>{{cite journal|title=The ecology of visual pigment tuning in an Australian marsupial: the honey possum ''Tarsipes rostratus'' |author=Sumner, Petroc; Arrese, Catherine A.; Partridge, Julian C.|journal = Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=208| issue=10|pages=1803<U+2013>15|year=2005|doi=10.1242/jeb.01610|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/208/10/1803 (fulltext)|accessdate=4 December 2010}}</ref> There is some evidence for other mammals as pollinators; ''B.&nbsp;attenuata''-like pollen was recovered from museum skins of [[dunnart]]s (''Sminthopsis'' spp.) and pygmy possums (''[[Cercartetus]]'' spp.), and the [[sugar glider]] (''Petaurus breviceps'') visited flower spikes in captivity.<ref name=Weins79/>

Seventeen species from several [[order (biology)|orders]] of slime molds ([[myxomycetes]]) have been isolated from the bark of ''Banksia attenuata''. Over half (nine) were from the order [[Stemonitales]], and [[Echinosteliales]] and [[Liceales]] were also common. The abundance of the first two orders may be due to the acidity of the bark. Another order, the [[Physarales]], was unusually rare<U+2014>other studies have demonstrated that the order is typically abundant on the bark of various species of tree around the world.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Jordan, C.C.; Brims, M.H.; Speijers, E.J.; Davison, E.M. |year=2006 |title=Myxomycetes on the bark of ''Banksia attenuata'' and ''B. menziesii'' (Proteaceae)|journal=Australian Journal of Botany |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=357<U+2013>65 |doi=10.1071/BT05079}}</ref>
