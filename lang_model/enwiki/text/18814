{{Catholic|Thomas Carve}}

'''Thomas Carve''' was a historian, b. in Co. [[Tipperary]], Ireland, 1590; d. probably in 1672. His correct name was Carew, that of a family of great influence in [[Munster]] during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. From his own works it is clear that the [[Earl of Ormonde (Irish)|Butlers of Ormonde]] were his patrons during his early years. It is not certain where he was educated, but he was ordained priest, and passed some years in an Irish [[diocese]]. 

On the invitation of [[Walter Butler, 11th Earl of Ormonde|Walter Butler]], then Colonel of an Irish regiment serving in Austria, he left Ireland and remained for some time as [[chaplain]] to Butler's regiment. He returned to Ireland twice (1630, 1632), and on the death of Butler he acted as chaplain to Devereux, Butler's successor in the command of the Irish forces fighting under [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]]. He accompanied the troops during several of the campaigns of the [[Thirty Years' War]], and had thus a good opportunity of observing the events recorded in his history of the war. In 1640 he was appointed chaplain to the English, Scotch, and Irish forces in Austria, and continued to hold that position till 1643, when he went to reside at Vienna as a choral vicar of [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna]]. His last book was published in [[Sulzbach]] in 1672.
