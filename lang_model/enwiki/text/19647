== History ==
{{See also|List of Ivy League university presidents#Dartmouth_College}}
Dartmouth was founded by [[Eleazar Wheelock]], a [[Puritan]] minister from Connecticut, who had previously sought to establish a school to train Native Americans as missionaries. Wheelock's ostensible inspiration for such an establishment largely resulted from his relationship with [[Mohegan]] Indian [[Samson Occom]]. Occom became an ordained minister after studying under Wheelock's tutelage from 1743 to 1747 and later moved to [[Long Island]] to preach to the Montauks.<ref name="history-lesson">{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/rauner/dartmouth/dartmouth_history.html | title = A Dartmouth History Lesson for Freshman | first = Francis Lane | last = Childs | work = Dartmouth Alumni Magazine | month = December | year = 1957 | accessdate = February 12, 2007 }}</ref>

Wheelock instituted Moor's Indian Charity School in 1755.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/Library_Bulletin/Nov1999/Hoefnagel_Close.html | title = Eleazar Wheelock's Two Schools | first = Dick | last = Hoefnagel | coauthors = Virginia L. Close | work = Dartmouth College Library Bulletin | month = November | year = 1999 | accessdate = August 23, 2008 }}</ref> The Charity School proved somewhat successful, but additional funding was necessary to continue school<U+2019>s operations. To this end, Wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money. Occom, accompanied by Reverend Nathaniel Whitaker, traveled to England in 1766 to raise money in the churches of that nation. With the funds, they established a trust to help Wheelock.<ref name="history-lesson"/> The head of the trust was [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth]].

[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-10-02 03 - Charter.jpg.jpg|thumb|upright|The Charter of Dartmouth College on display in [[Baker Memorial Library]]. The Charter was signed on December 13, 1769, on behalf of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III of Great Britain]].]]
Although the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School, Wheelock had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution;primarily because its location was far from tribal territories. In seeking to expand his school into a college, Wheelock relocated his educational enterprise to Hanover, in the [[Province of New Hampshire]]. The move from Connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter. The Royal Governor of New Hampshire, [[John Wentworth (governor)|John Wentworth]], provided the land upon which Dartmouth would be built and on December 13, 1769, conveyed the charter from [[King George III]] establishing the College. That charter created a college "for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land ... and also of English Youth and any others." The reference to educating Native American youth was included to connect Dartmouth to the Charity School and enable use of the Charity School's unspent trust funds. Named for [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth]] <U+2014> an important supporter of Eleazar Wheelock's earlier efforts but who, in fact, opposed creation of the College and never donated to it <U+2014> Dartmouth is the nation's ninth oldest college and the last institution of higher learning established under Colonial rule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/home/about/history.html |title=About Dartmouth <U+2013> History |publisher=Dartmouth.edu |date= |accessdate=October 15, 2010}}</ref> The College granted its first degrees in 1771 .<ref>{{cite book | first = Dick | last = Hoefnagel | coauthors = Virginia L.

Given the limited success of the Charity School, however, Wheelock intended his new College as one primarily for whites.<ref name="history-lesson"/><ref name="chi">{{cite web | url = http://chi.gospelcom.net/DAILYF/2002/08/daily-08-30-2002.shtml | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080407201012/http://chi.gospelcom.net/DAILYF/2002/08/daily-08-30-2002.shtml | archivedate = April 7, 2008 | title = Samson Occom | publisher = Christian History Institute | accessdate = August 23, 2008 }}</ref> Occom, disappointed with Wheelock's departure from the school's original goal of Indian Christianization, went on to form his own community of New England Indians called [[Brothertown Indians]] in New York.<ref name="history-lesson"/><ref name="chi"/>

In 1819, Dartmouth College was the subject of the historic [[Dartmouth College v. Woodward|Dartmouth College case]], in which the State of [[New Hampshire]]'s 1816 attempt to amend the College's royal charter to make the school a public university was challenged. An institution called [[Dartmouth University]] occupied the College buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817, though the College continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby.<ref name="history-lesson"/> [[Daniel Webster]], an [[alumnus]] of the class of 1801, presented the College's case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], which found the amendment of Dartmouth's charter to be an [[Contract Clause|illegal impairment of a contract]] by the state and reversed New Hampshire's takeover of the College. Webster concluded his peroration with the famous and frequently quoted words: "It is, Sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it."<ref name="history-lesson"/>

Dartmouth emerged onto the national academic stage at the turn of the 20th century. Prior to this period, the College had clung to traditional methods of instruction and was relatively poorly funded.<ref name="trd-wheelock"/> Under the presidency of [[William Jewett Tucker]] (1893<U+2013>1909), Dartmouth underwent a major revitalization of facilities, faculty, and the student body, following large endowments such as the $10,000 given by Dartmouth alumnus and law professor [[John Ordronaux (doctor)|John Ordronaux]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9805EED61F3EE233A2575AC2A9659C946997D6CF|title=Many Bequests to Carity; Will of Dr. Ordronaux D... | work =The New York Times | accessdate = February 20, 2009 | format=PDF | date=March 29, 1908}}</ref> Twenty new structures replaced antiquated buildings, while the student body and faculty both expanded threefold.

Dartmouth, previously serving as a men's institution, began admitting women as full-time students and undergraduate degree candidates in 1972 amid much controversy.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://ask.dartmouth.edu/categories/stulife/11.html | publisher = Dartmouth College | title = When did Dartmouth become co-educational? | work = AskDartmouth | accessdate = August 23, 2008 }}</ref> At about the same time, the College adopted its "[[#The Dartmouth Plan|Dartmouth Plan]]" of academic scheduling, permitting the student body to increase in size within the existing facilities.<ref name="kemeny-bio"/>

During the 1990s, the College saw a major academic overhaul under President [[James O.

=== The Dartmouth Plan ===
[[File:BakerLibrary.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Baker Memorial Library]] at Dartmouth College]]
Dartmouth functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week [[academic term]]s. The Dartmouth Plan (or simply "D-Plan") is an academic scheduling system that permits the customization of each student's academic year. All undergraduates are required to be in residence for the fall, winter, and spring terms of their freshman and senior years, as well as the summer term of their sophomore year.<ref name="d-plan-admin">{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/apply/generalinfo/overview/dplan.html | title = D-Plan | publisher = Admissions and Financial Aid| accessdate = August 23, 2008 }}</ref> During all other terms, students are permitted to choose between studying on-campus, studying at an off-campus program, or taking a term off for vacation, outside internships, or research projects.<ref name="d-plan-admin"/> The typical course load is three classes per term, and students will generally enroll in classes for twelve total terms over the course of their academic career.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/regulations/undergrad/working-rules.html | title = Working Rules and Procedures | publisher = Office of the Registrar | accessdate = August 23, 2008 }}</ref>

The D-Plan was instituted in the early 1970s at the same time that Dartmouth began accepting female undergraduates. It was initially devised as a plan to increase the enrollment without enlarging campus accommodations, and has been described as "a way to put 4,000 students into 3,000 beds."<ref name="trd-wheelock"/> Although new dormitories have been built since, the number of students has also increased and the D-Plan remains in effect. It was modified in the 1980s in an attempt to reduce the problems of lack of social and academic continuity.

=== Native Americans at Dartmouth ===
It is often pointed out that the charter of Dartmouth College, granted to [[Eleazar Wheelock]] in 1769, proclaims that the institution was created "for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing and all parts of Learning ... as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences; and also of English Youth and any others."<ref name="charter">{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmo.com/charter/charter.html | title = The Charter of Dartmouth College | publisher = Dartmo.com | accessdate = August 23, 2008 }}</ref> However, Wheelock primarily intended the College to educate white youth and the few Native students that attended Dartmouth experienced much difficulty in an institution ostensibly dedicated to their education. The funds for the Charity School for Native Americans that preceded Dartmouth College were raised primarily by the efforts of a Native American named [[Samson Occom]], and at least some of those funds were used to help found the College.<ref name="about-nap">{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nap/about/ | title = About the Native American Program | publisher = Native American Program | accessdate = August 23, 2008 }}</ref>

The College graduated only nineteen Native Americans during its first two hundred years.<ref name="about-nap"/> In 1970, the College established Native American academic and social programs as part of a "new dedication to increasing Native American enrollment."<ref name="about-nap"/> Since then, Dartmouth has graduated over 500 Native American students from over 120 different tribes, more than the other seven Ivy League universities combined.<ref name="about-nap"/>

The summer term was formerly marked by Tubestock, an unofficial tradition in which the students used wooden rafts and inner tubes to float on the [[Connecticut River]].

=== Seal ===
{{Main|Seal of Dartmouth College}}
[[File:Seal of Dartmouth College.png|thumb|upright|left|Seal of Dartmouth College]]

Dartmouth's 1769 royal charter required the creation of a [[seal (device)|seal]] for use on official documents and diplomas.<ref name="charter"/> The College's founder [[Eleazar Wheelock]] designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the [[Society for the Propagation of the Gospel]], a missionary society founded in London in 1701, in order to maintain the illusion that his college was more for mission work than for higher education.<ref name="good"/> Engraved by a Boston silversmith, the seal was ready by Commencement of 1773. The trustees officially accepted the seal on August 25, 1773, describing it as:

{{quote|An Oval, circumscribed by a Line containing SIGILL: COL: DARTMUTH: NOV: HANT: IN AMERICA 1770. within projecting a Pine Grove on the Right, whence proceed Natives towards an Edifice two Storey on the left; which bears in a Label over the Grove these Words "vox clamantis in deserto" the whole supported by Religion on the Right and Justice on the Left, and bearing in a Triangle irradiate, with the Hebrew Words [El Shaddai], agreeable to the above Impression, be the common Seal under which to pass all Diplomas or Certificates of Degrees, and all other Affairs of Business of and concerning Dartmouth College.<ref>Dartmouth College, Trustees' Records, 1:26. Dartmouth College Library, Special Collections, DA-1.</ref>}}

On October 28, 1926, the trustees affirmed the charter's reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone.<ref name="good"/> The College Publications Committee commissioned noted typographer [[William Addison Dwiggins|W. A. Dwiggins]] to create a line drawing version of the seal in 1940 that saw widespread use. Dwiggins' design was modified during 1957 to change the date from "1770" to "1769," to accord with the date of the College Charter. The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of "1769" to replace the old dies, now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use.<ref name="good"/> The 1957 design continues to be used under trademark number 2305032.<ref name="uspatent">{{cite web | url = http://www.uspto.gov/main/trademarks.htm | title = United States Patent and Trademark Office | accessdate = August 23, 2008 }}</ref>

=== Shield ===
On October 28, 1926, the Trustees approved a "Dartmouth College Shield" for general use. Artist and engraver W. Parke Johnson designed this emblem on the basis of the shield that is depicted at the center of the original seal. This design does not survive. On June 9, 1944 the trustees approved another [[coat of arms]] based on the shield part of the seal, this one by Canadian artist and designer [[Thoreau MacDonald]]. That design was used widely and, like Dwiggins' seal, had its date changed from "1770" to "1769" around 1958.<ref name="good"/> That version continues to be used under trademark registration number 3112676 and others.<ref name="uspatent"/>

College designer John Scotford made a stylized version of the shield during the 1960s, but it did not see the success of MacDonald's design.<ref>{{cite web | first = Jonathan | last = Good | title = A Proposal for a Heraldic Coat of Arms for Dartmouth College | url = http://www.dartmo.com/proposal/index.html | publisher = Dartmo. | accessdate = 2010-12-2 }} </ref> The shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of [[Dartmouth Medical School]], and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as 20 microns across.<ref>{{cite web | first = Joe | last = Nabity | url = http://www.jcnabity.com/dartseal.htm | publisher = Dartmouth College | title = Nanometer Pattern Generation System: Dartmouth Seal | accessdate = August 23, 2008 }}</ref> The design has appeared on [[Rudolph Ruzicka]]'s Bicentennial Medal ([[Philadelphia Mint]], 1969) and elsewhere.

Various student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a new mascot, but none has become "official."

== Controversy ==
In 2010, the senior class gift fund-raiser led to charges of strong-arming by Dartmouth College, which had student volunteers pressure and hassle students who refused to donate. In particular, Dartmouth College released particulars of senior students who refused to donate as a pressure tactic. This was in order to meet a 100% participation rate, which was a condition for a $100 000 gift by the class of 1960.

Specifically, the name and photo of a senior student, Laura A. Delorenzo (the only senior student who refused to donate, on the basis of being morally opposed), was released via the student newspaper and student blog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thelittlegreenblog.blogspot.com/2010/06/delorenzo-10-almost-costs-dartmouth.html |title=The Little Green Blog: DeLorenzo '10 almost costs Dartmouth $100,000 |publisher=Thelittlegreenblog.blogspot.com |date=June 3, 2010 |accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref> The incident was then widely reported in the news media and blogs.<ref name="nytimes1">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/28/business/28gift.html |newspaper=The New York Times|title=Students Feel Peer Pressure to Donate|first=Sephanie|last=Stom|date=October 27, 2010| accessdate=December 28, 2010}}</ref>

In response to the media reports, Dartmouth College stated that it regretted the releasing of the personal particulars of the student in question, and that it was "highly inappropriate" to have done so,<ref name="nytimes1"/> but defended its actions as being necessary in order to obtain the donations. As such, they would be retaining their current program structure and no administrative actions will be taken against the administrator responsible for the incident.<ref>{{cite web|last=Field |first=Kelly |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Students-at-2-Ivy-League/125056/?key=QGx0cF8%2FNCIRbHA0YzoQbT8EYCFsOR13YCFEbiwrblxTGA%3D%3D |title=Students at 2 Ivy League Colleges Shamed Seniors Who Failed to Donate <U+2013> Fund Raising <U+2013> The Chronicle of Higher Education |publisher=Chronicle.com |date=October 24, 2010 |accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref>

== In popular culture ==
Dartmouth College has appeared in or been referenced by a number of popular media.

The 1978 comedy film ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' was cowritten by [[Chris Miller (writer)|Chris Miller]] '63, and is based loosely on a series of stories he wrote about his fraternity days at Dartmouth. In a CNN interview, [[John Landis]] said the movie was "based on Chris Miller's real fraternity at Dartmouth," [[Alpha Delta|Alpha Delta Phi]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-24340227_ITM| title = Interview with John Landis | work = [[CNN]] | date = August 29, 2003 | accessdate = February 12, 2007 }}</ref>
