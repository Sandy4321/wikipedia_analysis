'''Cruz Reynoso''' (born 2 May 1931) is a [[civil rights]] lawyer, professor emeritus of law, and the first [[Chicano]] Associate Justice of the [[California Supreme Court]] (1982<U+2013>87). He also served on the California [[California_Courts_of_Appeal#Third_District|Third District Court of Appeal]].<ref name=lawucdavisedu062510>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Reynoso/index.aspx|title=Cruz Reynoso|work=[[UC Davis|UC Davis School of Law]]|publisher=law.ucdavis.edu|accessdate=25 June 2010}}</ref>  In 1986, along with two other members of the California Supreme Court<U+2014>Chief Justice [[Rose Bird]] and Associate Justice [[Joseph Grodin]]<U+2014>Reynoso became one of only three State Supreme Court justices ever recalled and ousted by voters under California's judicial-retention election system. He served as vice-chairman of the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] from 1993 to 2004.

In 2000, Reynoso received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the United States' highest civilian honor, for his efforts to address social inequities and his public service.

==Early life and education==
Reynoso was born in [[Brea, California]].<ref name=ocregister052810>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/news/reynoso-250999-court-habra.html|title=State's first Latino Supreme Court judge speaks at library|date=28 May 2010|work=[[The Orange County Register]]|publisher=ocregister.com|accessdate=25 June 2010}}</ref> He grew up as one of 11 children, and from age eight worked as an agricultural worker in orange groves.<ref name=gu-interview>{{cite interview | url = http://www.ll.georgetown.edu/nejl/Cruz_Reynoso_trans.cfm | last = Reynoso | first = Cruz | interviewer = Alan Houseman | program = Oral History Collection | program = National Equal Justice Library, Georgetown University Law Center | date = 12 August 2002 | accessdate =10 June 2011 }}</ref> His father was a [[farmworker]].<ref name=ocregister052810/>

When Reynoso was seven, the family moved to a [[barrio]] outside of [[La Habra, California]].<ref name=gu-interview/> While there, he attended the [[Wilson Grammar School]], a racially-segregated grade school for children of Mexican descent.<ref name=gu-interview/><ref>{{cite news | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-05/news/mn-659_1_wilson-school | title = 'Mexican School' Alumni to Hold La Habra Reunion: It has been closed for 40 years, but graduates of segregated Wilson school still remember | last = Reyes | first = David | date = 5 September 1990 | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | location = Los Angeles | accessdate =10 June 2011}}</ref>  His junior high school was integrated, as was [[Fullerton Union High School]], from which he graduated.<ref name=gu-interview/>

The [[United States Postal Service]] refused to provide [[Rural Free Delivery]] service within the barrio, even though non-minority families living nearby received the service.

He then served as deputy director of [[California Rural Legal Assistance]] in 1968.<ref name=gu-interview/><ref name=suffolk/> Shortly thereafter, internal problems at CRLA lead to his assuming the directorship; he was the first Latino to hold the position.<ref name=gu-interview/><ref name=suffolk>{{cite press release | url = http://www.suffolk.edu/45626.html | title = Cruz Reynoso: Sowing the Seeds of Justice | publisher = Suffolk University | date = 24 February 2011 | accessdate =10 June 2011}}</ref>  His work with CRLA gained him national recognition.<ref name=dateline-ucd/> Reynoso recalls that, during his tenure, CRLA was "mentioned not infrequently as being the leading legal services program in the country."<ref name=gu-interview/> Then-Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] attempted to cut state funding for the CRLA during Reynoso's tenure, but the agency successfully resisted the challenge.<ref name=lat-swept-7>Hager, ''Justice Prevails'', p.

He was a professor of law at the [[University of New Mexico School of Law]] from 1972 to 1976.<ref name=lawucdavisedu062510/>

==Judiciary career==
In 1976, Reynoso was appointed to the [[California Court of Appeal]] as an associate justice.<ref name=lawucdavisedu062510/> He was the first Latino appointed to the Court.<ref name=gu-interview/> In 1981, he was appointed to the California Supreme Court by outgoing Governor [[Jerry Brown]], succeeding the retiring [[Mathew O.

In 1982, Reynoso was up for reconfirmation: under a measure adopted in 1934, California voters confirm a governor's appointments, and periodic unopposed elections are held for each justice during general elections, giving voters the opportunity to vote a justice out of office.<ref name=bee-82>{{cite news | title = 'Jerry's Judges' confirmed despite GOP challenge | newspaper = The Modesto Bee | location = Modesto, CA | date = 3 November 1982 | page = A6 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dbpJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-BwNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5803%2C1026519 | accessdate =10 June 2011 }}</ref> Deukmejian, running as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate for governor, urged voters to vote against justices [[Otto Kaus]], [[Allen Broussard]], and Reynoso; he hoped to replace them with conservative appointees, creating a new majority on the Court.<ref name=pc-vote>{{cite news | title = Vote To Confirm Justice Defended By Deukmejian | agency = AP | newspaper = The Press-Courier | date = 13 September 1982 | page = 18 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LEdKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3yINAAAAIBAJ%20-wikipedia&pg=2263%2C2768838 | accessdate =10 June 2011 | location = Oxnard, CA }}</ref> The Californians for Judicial Reform campaign to unseat the justices cited Reynoso's stance joining Richardson's majority opinion upholding the constitutionality of [[California Proposition 8 (1982)|Proposition 8]], the "Victim's Bill of Rights", as among the reasons the justices were "soft on crime".<ref>{{cite news | title = Campaign Targets 3 Brown Appointees in High Court Retention Vote | agency = AP | newspaper = The Press-Courier | date = 15 September 1982 | accessdate =10 June 2011 | page = 16 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LkdKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3yINAAAAIBAJ&pg=6540%2C3064450 | location = Oxnard, CA }}</ref>  The campaign labelled Kaus, Broussard, and Reynoso "Jerry's Judges".<ref name=bee-82/>  All three justices were retained; Reynoso received the lowest margin of victory, receiving the vote of only 52 percent of voters.<ref name=partisan>{{cite journal | title = The Effect of Partisan Information on Voters in Nonpartisan Elections | last = Squire | first = Peverill | last2 = Smith | first2 = Eric R.

Also during the 1980s, Reynoso was a member of the Congressional Select Commission on Immigrant and Refugee Policy.<ref name=lodi-wilson/> He was appointed by President [[Jimmy Carter]].<ref name="aba-raise"/>

As part of the court led by Chief Justice [[Rose Bird]], Reynoso was part of the liberal majority.<ref name=fullerton-speaker>{{cite web | url = http://www.fullerton.edu/immigrationconference/speakers.htm | title = Featured Speakers | work = Immigration Conference 2008 | publisher = California State University, Fullerton | location = Fullerton, CA | at = Hon.

When a case came before the Supreme Court regarding whether or not due process required that a non-English-speaking person charged with a crime be provided with an interpreter, Reynoso drew upon his experiences representing such clients to persuade a majority of his fellow justices that "basic fairness on the constitutional sense require that there be an interpreter for that individual".<ref name=npr-identity>{{cite interview | last = Reynoso | first = Cruz | interviewer = [[Michel Martin]] | title = Should Identity Matter On The Bench? | program = [[National Public Radio]] | date = 15 July 2009 | accessdate =12 June 2011 | url = http://www.npr.org/tablet/#story/?storyId=106636900 }}</ref>

===Ouster from the Supreme Court===

"There's clearly an effort to politicize the court", Reynoso told United Press International during the campaign.<ref name=football>{{cite news | title = Reynoso: Court now a 'political football' | agency = UPI | newspaper = The Union Democrat | location = Sonora, CA | date = 17 October 1986 | page = 5A | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xR1ZAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qEYNAAAAIBAJ&pg=6692%2C2348117 | accessdate =11 June 2011 | volume = 133 | number = 78 }}</ref> He was endorsed by the California Organization of Police and Sheriffs.<ref name=football/> According to California attorney general John Van de Kamp, the court refused to hear appeals of, or affirmed, 97 percent of convictions in the 1984/85 fiscal year; Reynoso remarked, "That doesn't sound at all like a 'soft on crime' record".<ref name=football/> Defending his death-penalty votes, he said that "most, but not all" of the reversals stemmed from the [[California Proposition 7 (1978)|1978 Briggs Amendment]], which "does not comport with US Supreme Court law".<ref name=politicized/>

Afterward, Donald Heller, a former Federal prosecutor who drafted the 1978 death-penalty initiative approved by California voters, disagreed with the campaign to unseat the justices, calling Reynoso "a thoughtful, decent man who got thrown out" and "a very capable judge who tried to do the right thing in cases."<ref>{{cite news | title = Tossed off court, but still a victor | last = Breton | first = Marcos | newspaper = Sacramento Bee | location = Sacramento, CA | date = 12 September 2007 }}</ref> Reynoso said of the result, "you can't blame [the voters] when the governor of the state, who is a lawyer, says the justices aren't following the law. If I didn't know better, I would have voted against me, too."<ref name=lat-swept-2/>

====Impact of the ouster campaign====
The 1986 California Supreme Court retention election started a major trend turning such elections into "an ideological battleground over judicial philosophies and specific decisions",  making them "as highly salient as races for overtly political offices", wrote one academic paper.<ref name=dann/> Even before the election, California Supreme Court Justice [[Otto Kaus]] remarked "You cannot forget the fact that you have a crocodile in your bathtub",<ref name=bee-croc>{{cite news | title = The crocodile in the bathtub (Editorial) | newspaper = The Modesto Bee | location = Modesto, CA | date = 6 July 1985 | page = A12 | volume = 108 | number = 187 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=brBJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Ex0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=3958%2C1948870 | accessdate =11 June 2011}}</ref> referring to the act of making a judicial decision without regard to the potential political consequences.<ref name=wendel>{{cite journal | title = The Ideology of Judging and the First Amendment in Judicial Election Campaigns | last = Wendel | first = W.

[[Erwin Chemerinsky]], a law professor from the [[University of Southern California]], agreed with the ousted Justice Grodin, saying "the legacy of 1986 could be that justices facing retention elections will decide cases with an eye, perhaps subconsciously, on how their rulings will affect their chances at the polls."<ref name=chemerinsky>{{cite journal | title = Comments: Evaluating Judicial Candidates | last = Chemerinsky | first = Erwin | journal = Southern California Law Review | volume = 61 | pages=  1985<U+2013>1994 | url = http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1692&context=faculty_scholarship&sei-redir=1#search=%221986+california+judicial+election%22 | accessdate =11 June 2011 | year = 1988 | format = PDF }}</ref>  Chemerinsky called for abolishing judicial-review elections.<ref name=chemerinsky/> He wrote, "Largely due to defects in a poorly worded death penalty law, the court had a strikingly one-sided pattern of decisions on the issue", noting that this, Bird's controversial history, the trio's appointments by an unpopular governor, and the realization by their opponents that the court's ideology could be completely changed if the campaign succeeded lead to the opposition campaign.<ref name=chemerinsky/> Jazon Czarnezki, assistant professor of law at [[Marquette University]], attributed Bird's defeat to "her resolute opposition to the death penalty and overturning a series of death sentences".<ref name=czarnezki>{{cite journal | title = A Call for Change: Improving judicial selection methods | last = Czarnezki | first = Jason J. | journal = Marquette Law Review | year = 2005 | volume = 89 | number = 1 | pages = 169<U+2013>178 | publisher = Marquette University | issn = 0025-3987 | url = http://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1092&context=mulr&sei-redir=1#search=%221986+california+judicial+election%22 | format = PDF | accessdate =11 June 2011 }}</ref> Exit polls indicated that the death-penalty issue was the major reason why voters refused to retain the justices.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Choosing judicial candidates: how voters explain their decisions | last = Hojnacki | first = Marie | last2 = Baum | first2 = Lawrence | journal = Judicature | volume = 75 | number = 6 | month = April<U+2013>May | year = 1992 | pages = 300<U+2013>309 | url = http://www.tfoje.org/cms/modules/document_archives/6/documents/Choosing%20Between%20Judicial%20Candidates%20How%20Voters%20Explain%20Their%20Decisions%20ARTICLE.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =11 June 2011}}</ref>

Despite the fact that California Supreme Court justices undergoing a retention election are running uncontested, the median spending for justices' campaigns rose from $3,177 in 1976 to $70,000 in 1994.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Preserving an Independent Judiciary: The need for contribution and expenditure limits in judicial elections | last = Chemerinsky | first = Erwin | journal = Chicago-Kent Law Review | year = 1998 | volume = 74 | issue = 1 | pages = 133<U+2013>150 | issn = 0009-3599 | format = PDF | url = http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2139&context=faculty_scholarship&sei-redir=1#search=%221986+california+judicial+election%22 | accessdate =11 June 2011}}</ref>
