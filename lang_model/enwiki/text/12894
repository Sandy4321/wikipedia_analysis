==Career==
Growing up in Sweden, Hosk was presented with offers to model during high school after her father submitted photographs to various modeling agencies in Sweden when she was 13<ref name="Cafe"/> and she began modeling at 14.<ref name="Metro"/> She did some modeling in high school but decided to primarily concentrate on her studies instead (she did some notable work with Guess and other companies however). After graduating, she decided to pursue a career in Swedish professional basketball. Hosk has commented that the level of play in Swedish professional basketball was not on par with the [[WNBA]], and that interest in the sport was not as great in Sweden. Although she ultimately abandoned professional basketball for modeling, she has said that the intense rigor of practices (8 per week when playing basketball) and travel helped prepare her for the physical and travel demands of the modeling world.<ref name="Fashionista"/>

After playing professional basketball for two years, she began receiving many job offers and soon moved to [[New York City]] to begin modeling full-time. Some writers have speculated that her work with Victoria's Secret was what brought her into the top tier fashion world, but Hosk also identifies her work with photographer [[Ellen von Unwerth]] in campaigns for Guess.<ref name="Ocean Drive"/>

==Personal life==
Elsa Hosk is the daughter of father P<U+00E5>l and mother Marja. She has two siblings, a younger brother Lukas and older brother Johan.<ref name="Cafe"/> Her cousin, Alice Herbst, is also a model. Herbst won the televised competition of ''Sweden's Top Model'' in 2012.<ref name="SvD">{{cite news |title=Alice vann "Top model" |first= |last= |url=http://www.svd.se/kultur/alice-vann-top-model_6988043.svd |newspaper=SvD |date=11 April 2012 |language=Swedish |trans_title=Alice won the "Top Model" |accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref>

Hosk has worked to support the anti-human-trafficking organization, [[FAIR Girls]]. She became interested in the issue after seeing the movie ''[[The Whistleblower]]'', which dealt with issues of sex trafficking.<ref name="Ocean Drive"/>
