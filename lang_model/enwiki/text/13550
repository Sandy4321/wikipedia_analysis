'''Latchman Bhansingh''' (born 26 November 1966) is a former Canadian [[cricket]]er of [[Indo-Guyanese]] origins.

Born in [[Bartica]], Bhansingh captained Guyana's under-19 side at two West Indies Youth Championships, in 1985 (when Guyana won the title) and in 1986.<ref>Charwayne Walker (14 July 2013).
