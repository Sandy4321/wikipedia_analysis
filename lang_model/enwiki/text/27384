==History==
'Pakistan International Airlines', or 'PIA' for short, can trace its beginnings to the days when Pakistan was not a nation, rather a region of [[British India]]. In 1946 [[Muhammed Ali Jinnah]] realised the need for an airline network for the forming country and called upon the help of an industrialist [[Mirza Ahmad Ispahani]] to develop a flag carrier for the nation. Meanwhile, an airline called '[[Orient Airways]]', registered in [[Calcutta]], was formed on 23 October 1946. In February 1947, the airline brought three [[DC-3]] airplanes from a company in Texas, and in May of that year the airline was granted a licence to fly. Services were started in June from Kolkata to [[Akyab|Sittwe]] and [[Rangoon|Yangon]]. This was the first post-war airline flight by a [[South Asian]] registered airline company.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Two months after this service began, Pakistan was formed. Orient Airways began relief flights to the new nation and, soon after, it moved its operations to [[Karachi]], where it began flights to [[Dhaka]] on 7 June 1954. In addition, the first two domestic routes in Pakistan were established, from Karachi to [[Lahore]] to [[Peshawar]], and from Karachi to [[Quetta]] to Lahore.
[[File:Lockheed L1049 AP-AFQ PIA LHR 08.04.55 edited-3.jpg|thumb|right|PIA L1049C Super Constellation at London (Heathrow) Airport in 1955]]
[[File:PIA Convair CV-240 in late 50s. circa.jpg|thumb|A [[Convair|Convair CV-240]] in the 1950s at Karachi airport]]
The Government of Pakistan, realizing the operation was failing economically, proposed that Orient Airways merge into a new national airline. On 11 March 1955, Orient Airways merged with the government's proposed airline, becoming 'Pakistan International Airlines Corporation'. During the same year the airline opened its first international service, from Karachi to [[London Heathrow Airport]]<ref>[http://www.piac.com.pk/pia_about/pia-about_history.asp About PIA - History] PIA official website. Retrieved 01 August 2010.</ref> via [[Cairo International Airport]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci Airport]] in [[Fiumicino, Italy]], using three newly-acquired Lockheed L-1049C Super Constellations. The DC-3s continued operating the domestic services in Pakistan. In May 1956, PIA ordered two further Super [[Lockheed Constellation]]s of the latest L-1049H version and five [[Vickers Viscount|Vickers Viscount 815]]. In 1959, [[Malik Nur Khan]] was named Managing Director.

In March 1960, PIA became the first Asian airline to use jet aircraft when [[Boeing 707]] services were introduced.
<ref name="piahistory">{{cite web|url=http://www.piac.com.pk/pia_about/pia-about_history.asp |title=About PIA - History |publisher=PIA |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}</ref> The aircraft were [[wet lease]]d from [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American]] and in 1961 services were begun to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in New York City. In 1962, orders were placed for [[Boeing 720]]s, [[Fokker F27]]s and [[Sikorsky Aircraft|Sikorsky]] helicopters. One of PIA's Boeing 720s broke a world record that year, when it flew from London to Karachi non-stop in 6 hours and 43 minutes and 51 seconds<ref name="piahistory"/> during its delivery flight {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}from Seattle, piloted by PIA's senior Captain Abdullah Baig, a record unbroken to this day.<ref name="piahistory"/> During 1962, services to [[East Pakistan]] (now [[Bangladesh]]) were proving to be difficult, therefore PIA placed their [[Sikorsky S-61]] helicopters on these routes until 1966 when conditions improved. In 1964 PIA became the first airline from a non-communist country to fly to the People's Republic of China.<ref name="piahistory"/> As the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] broke out, PIA helped the [[Pakistani Armed Forces]] with logistics and transport. In 1966, the Viscounts were phased out, substituted by four [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]]s. However, as growth surpassed the need for these aircraft, they were later sold to [[CAAC|Civil Aviation Administration of China]].

The 1970s saw the resumption of transatlantic flights and new destinations. It once again aided the [[Pakistan Army]] by transporting soldiers to [[East Pakistan]] in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]<ref>[http://www.pakdef.info/pakmilitary/army/main.html The Evolution of The Pakistan Army By Brig. (Ret.) Noor A. Husain]</ref> and lost a couple of its aircraft to [[Indian Air Force]] fighters.<ref>[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1971War/Appendix3.html Aircraft Losses In Pakistan <U+2212>1971 War (PAF, Army Aviation, and Civilian aircraft Casualties) <U+2013> by P V S Jagan Mohan]</ref> In 1972 it applied to operate to [[Libya]] and an agreement was signed with [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] airline [[JAT]]. In 1973, [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]]s arrived and were used by the airline before they were replaced by [[Boeing 707-300]]s. In 1974 air freight services started, as well as a cargo service to New York City under the name, 'Pakistan International Cargo'. In 1975, PIA introduced new uniforms for air hostesses. These uniforms were chosen through an open competition, the winning entry was a design by Sir Hardy Amies who was designer to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

In 1976, leased [[Boeing 747-200]]Bs came into service. In 1979, the airline bought their first Boeing 747-200BM aircraft. Also in 1978 the airline provided help to [[Somali Airlines]], [[Air Malta]] and [[Yemenia]] and established a hotel management service in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. PIA leased two of its own Boeing 720s to Air Malta during the 70s.

[[Image:PIA-F27-Lahore-30861.JPG|thumb|The [[Fokker F27]] was once the backbone of PIA's northern area flights in the 1990s <ref>[http://www.historyofpia.com/olddays2.htm PIA in the old days] History of PIA, assessed 03-02-2009</ref>]]
The 1980s began with the opening of a cargo centre in Karachi and the delivery of a new aircraft, [[Airbus A300|Airbus A300B4-203]]. In 1981, a duty-free sales service was inaugurated. During 1982, the first C and D checks were carried out on the fleet in Karachi. In 1984, domestic night coach fare service was introduced to offer lower prices for low-income passengers. In 1985 the [[PIA Planetarium]] tourist attraction was inaugurated in Karachi and later in Lahore. In the same year, five [[Boeing 737-300]]s joined the fleet making PIA the first Asian operator of such a type. Two former PIA Boeing 720Bs now form part of the Planetarium's exhibition at Karachi and Lahore. In late 1987 and early 1988, flights were introduced to [[Mal<U+00E9>]] and to [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], respectively. In 1989, the first women pilots started their career on passenger airplanes.

During June 1991, PIA received the first of six [[Airbus A310-300]] aircraft on from [[Airbus|Airbus Industrie]]. In 1992, flights started to [[Tashkent]] and in 1993, to [[Z<U+00FC>rich International Airport|Z<U+00FC>rich, Switzerland]]. In addition, PIA became a user of the [[Sabre]], [[Galileo]] and [[Amadeus]] global distribution systems. During 1994, PIA added [[Jakarta]], [[Fujairah]], [[Baku]] and [[Al-Ain]] to its destinations. Air Safari flights were launched in the same year using Boeing 737<U+2013>300 aircraft over the [[Karakoram]] mountains. In 1995, PIA received a Boeing 747 flight simulation system and a used [[Air France]] A300 aircraft was bought. In 1996 the airline leased [[Tupolev]] [[Tu-154]] aircraft, and re-opened services to [[Beirut]].

PIA only used the [[Tupolev Tu-154]] for a short time to deal with the demand during the summer of 1996. In 1999, PIA leased five Boeing 747<U+2013>300 aircraft from [[Cathay Pacific]] to replace its aging Boeing 747-200M fleet. The aircraft wore a new livery with a handwork Pashmina tail on white body and large Pakistan titles on the front fuselage. The livery was applied to some of the fleet during the 90s but due to copyright problems the livery was dropped. The Boeing 747-300s remained in the new look but with a plain green tail with PIA titles. The other aircraft in the fleet were repainted in the 1990s livery.

===Expansion===
[[File:Pia.b747-367.ap-bfw.750pix.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 747-300]] on finals to [[London Heathrow Airport]], England]]
In July 2002, PIA purchased six [[Boeing 747-300]] aircraft from [[Cathay Pacific]], five of which were already on lease with PIA. The sixth arrived shortly after and PIA operated it mainly on its North American and European routes. In October 2002, after a period of ten years without any new order, the airline purchased eight [[Boeing 777]] aircraft from [[The Boeing Company]], including three [[777-200ER]] (Extended Range), two [[777-200LR]] (Longer Range) and three [[777-300ER]] versions. PIA was the launch customer that revived the Boeing 777-200LR project that, until then, only had three orders by [[EVA Air]]. The first two Boeing 777-200LR produced were test aircraft used by Boeing, before they were delivered to PIA. One of these Boeing 777-200LR was displayed at the [[Paris Airshow]] during 2005.

{{externalvideo|video1=[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A36OCBrjUXQ A promotional video by PIA on delivery of the Boeing 777]}}
During 2004, PIA took delivery of its first Boeing 777-200ER aircraft in January. On delivery of the first three Boeing 777-200ERs the airline introduced a new aircraft livery, which was later applied to the majority of the fleet. PIA also acquired six half life [[Airbus A310|Airbus A310-300/ET]] from the Airbus management on a ten year lease agreement. On 3 November 2005 PIA signed an agreement with the aircraft manufacturer, [[ATR (aviation)|ATR]] to purchase seven [[ATR 42|ATR42-500]]. The aircraft were purchased to replace the aging F-27 aircraft. The seven ATR aircraft were delivered between 2006 and 2007.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} On 6 December 2005, PIA leased an additional new Boeing 777-200ER from the [[International Lease Finance Corporation]] (ILFC). The aircraft had the same specifications as the previous Boeing 777-200ER that PIA operated. The aircraft was delivered in January 2007 on ten year lease to the airline.

On 25 February 2006 Boeing delivered its first 777-200LR Worldliner to PIA, where it flew from [[Everett, Washington|Everett]] to Islamabad via [[Manchester]], England. PIA started [[non-stop flight]]s from [[Toronto]] to Karachi, Islamabad and Lahore from 3 March 2006 taking advantage of Boeing 777-200LR's long range capability. PIA planned non-stop flights to New York City and other US cities with sizable Pakistani population centres, but was not given permission due to security reasons. On 31 May 2006, PIA took delivery of its first ATR aircraft from Toulouse, France. On 23 December 2006, PIA took delivery of its first [[Boeing 777-300ER]]. After the arrival of a second [[ATR 42|ATR 42<U+2013>500]], PIA has ceased using military [[C-130 Hercules|Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] for passenger services in the north of Pakistan. The military planes were being used after the [[Fokker F27]] fleet was grounded due to a fatal crash in July 2006.

Zafar Khan was appointed as the new chairman of Pakistan International Airlines. A team from the European Union visited Karachi in July 2007, to check the condition of the planes and review the ban. On 5 July 2007, the EU lifted the restriction on 11 aircraft that PIA could fly into Europe, of which five were [[Boeing 747-300]]s and six [[Airbus A310-300]]s.<ref>[http://pakstrategy.blogspot.com/2007/08/eu-lifts-ban-on-eleven-pia-planes.html Pakstrategy: EU Lifts ban on Eleven PIA Planes]</ref> On 29 November 2007, The EU completely lifted the ban on PIA.<ref>[http://www.brecorder.com/index.php?id=657501&currPageNo=1&query=&search=&term=&supDate= EU Lifts ban on PIA] [[Business Recorder Group|Brecorder Newspapers]], Accessed 1 December 2007</ref> In the same year, PIA signed a lease deal for seven new [[Airbus A320-200]] from Kuwait based leasing company [[ALAFCO]], the factory built aircraft were to be delivered between 2009 and 2010, however the deal however was cancelled in 2008.

== Corporate management ==
===Structure===
Pakistan International Airlines Corporation (PIAC) is majority owned by the [[Government of Pakistan]] (87%) while the remainder (13%) by private shareholders. The airline falls under the direction of the [[Ministry of Defence (Pakistan)|Ministry of Defence]] chaired by its current chairman, [[Ahmad Mukhtar]]. The airline is managed by [[managing director]], Captain Aijaz Haroon as well as the [[Board of Directors]]. The Board consists of nine independent non-executive members and has four sub-committees, being an Audit Committee, Brand and Advertising Committee, Finance Committee and Human Resource Committee each with its own charter and chairman. The [[Managing director|MD]] leads the executive management of staff who control the running of the airline. The airline's main headquarters are located in [[Karachi]] whilst smaller sub head offices are located in several cities within Pakistan.

===Privatisation===
[[File:PIA Head Office, Lahore.jpg|thumb|PIA offices in [[Lahore]]]]
In the late 1990s, the Government of Pakistan considered selling the airline to the private sector due to the persistent losses suffered by the airline. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The Government announced the privatisation plans but they were never implemented. Several steps towards outsourcing of non-core business have been initiated. Catering units (starting with Karachi Flight Kitchen), ground handling (starting with ramp services) and engineering, are to be gradually carved out of the airline and operated as independent companies. During 1997, Pakistan called in a team from [[International Finance]] (IFC), the consulting arm of the [[World Bank]], to advise on restructuring and privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) however no agreement was reached.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/1997/01/01/5517/pia-privatisation.html PIA privatisation] Flight International Magazine, printed 01-01-1997, assessed 09-03-2009</ref> The government has many times planned the privatization of the State owned. however as of yet no reasonable agreement or solution has been found. On 18 February 2009 the carrier was dropped from the privatisation list.<ref>[http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=163129 Pak Steel, PIA dropped from privatisation list] The News, Jang Newspapers Published 18-02-2009, assessed 09-03-2009</ref>

===Financial performance===
The following table gives the key financial results for the 2009 financial year along with those for the past five years <ref name="piac.com.pk">http://www.piac.com.pk/PIA_About/profiles/2009/AnnualReport2009_31032010.pdf</ref>
. The airline reported a reduction of post tax losses of 83% in 2009 (compared to 2008) based on a reduction in fuel cost, comparatively stable exchange rate for the Pakistan Ruppee and higher revenues. The exchange losses due to declining Ruppee rate were reported to be PKR 6.71 billion in 2009 compared to a whopping PKR 24.12 billion in 2008.  

The airline also faces other challenges to its profitability such as staffing levels and overall management challenges. An employee count of 17,944 for a fleet of 40 aircraft <ref name="piac.com.pk"/>
is clearly an area that needs to be reviewed .

The current year interim results (half yearly report for 2010) <ref>http://www.piac.com.pk/PIA_About/profiles/2010/PIA-Half-Yearly-Report-2010_21092010.pdf</ref> do not show any improvement in profitability. The after tax losses reported for the first six months of 2010 are PKR 6.90 billion as compared to PKR 5.39 billion for the first six months of 2009. Revenue, however, did increase to PKR 49.31 billion for the first half of 2010 compared with PKR 41.92 billion for the first half of 2009.

Passenger traffic has been more or less static over the last five years hovering around the five and a half million mark with a load factor of around 70%.

It is interesting to look at the annual revenue breakdown for 2009: 89.4% is from passenger traffic with just 5.3% from cargo. The remaining 5.3% is from excess baggage charges, charter, engineering and other services.

===Fleet developments===
* The airline is said to be in talks with [[Airbus]] and [[Boeing]] and is discussing narrowbody replacements for the 20+ year old [[Boeing 737-300]]. According to PIA Chairman Captain Aijaz, "The airline plans to acquire up to 27 aircraft, through a mix of orders and leases. We'll place seven firm orders with nine purchase rights, and take ten from leasing companies. Deliveries will start at the end of 2010.".<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/06/17/328381/paris-air-show-pia-in-final-discussions-with-airbus-and-boeing-for-major-narrowbody.html]</ref>

===Livery===
In December 2003 PIA introduced a new image that was applied to their first [[777-200ER]] and on two leased A310-300s one of which was in service. The livery was white at the front and beige at the rear separated by a dark green stripe. The tail was painted white with PIA written in dark green. PAKISTAN was added to the front fuselage and the engines where painted beige. The PIA written in calligraphic Urdu was added just behind the cockpit. 

However, due to criticism the design was modified before the first Boeing 777 was delivered. PIA and Boeing replaced the tail with a flowing Pakistan flag on a beige background. PAKISTAN titles were removed and the PIA acronym was enlarged and moved onto the fuselage. The engines and Urdu PIA remained the same. The leased A310s and most of PIA fleet also adopted this livery at a later date. 

In early 2006 the airline launched four new tail designs for its fleet. The tails represented the four provinces of Pakistan: [[Sindh]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[North-West Frontier Province|Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa]] and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]].<ref>[http://www.piac.com.pk/PIA_About/pr_14march06.asp PIA launches four new tails]</ref> The tails promoted the cultures of the four provinces of Pakistan by applying motifs to the tails and adding a city name to the rear of the fuselage corresponding to the province. The "Frontier" tail represented the "Phulkari" (flowering) pattern that reflected a tradition of embroidery generally done on shawls, shirts and linen. The "Punjab" tail was loosely related to the tile decoration of the [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] in Lahore. The "Balochistan" tail showed the creativity seen in the kilims, carpets and rugs woven with wool, goat or camel hair and mixed yarn. The pattern is mostly bold geometric motifs in primary colours dominated by red. The "Sindh" tail was influenced from the Hala tile work with electric blue and white floral patterns. In 2008 management stopped the application of provincial tails deeming them too costly.

PIA launched their new livery in early April 2010. An Airbus A310, Boeing 777-200 and Boeing 747-300 were the first aircraft to wear the new look. The livery was unveiled at the PIA headquarters on a Boeing 777 model.<ref>[http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/jj139/pfactorkhi/f19fb6f4.jpg PIA New Livery on a model]</ref> The livery is loosely based on the hugely popular 1980s "Sohni Dharti" livery and is expected to be painted on all of the active fleet when they are put into routine maintenance.<ref>[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2010\04\03\story_3-4-2010_pg5_6 PIA unveils new livery design for aircarft] Daily Times, accessed 18-04-2010</ref>

The livery consists of a Green and Gold strip running around the bottom of the fuselage and continuing right up until the tail cone. The forward/upper portion is white and at the rear it is an off white/beige colour. The bottom part of the tail blends into the upper fuselage as it is too white with the rest of the tail painted with a large wavy Pakistan flag which takes up the whole tail in a dark green colour.
At the front of the fuselage 'PIA' is written in a billboard style in dark green and underneath 'Pakistan International' is written in gold. 
Just behind the cockpit there is a stylised Urdu PIA logo as well as on the engines. Underneath 'Pakistan' is written in bold on the aircraft belly

==Special operations==
===Charter services===
PIA operates private charter flights using ATR 42s to [[Kadanwari]] and [[Sawan Airport]] in [[Sindh]] as well as to other parts of the country on behalf of oil and gas companies. Ad hoc charters for United Nations peacekeeping troops are also carried out to Africa and Eastern Europe using Boeing 747s.

===Hajj and Umrah operations===
PIA operates a two-month (pre- and post-) [[Hajj]] operation each year to and from [[Jeddah]] and sometimes [[Madinah]] in [[Saudi Arabia]]. PIA transports over 130,000 intending pilgrims each year from [[Karachi]], [[Lahore]], [[Islamabad]], [[Peshawar]], [[Quetta]], [[Faisalabad]], [[Multan]], [[Sialkot]],  and [[Sukkur]] to the [[Saudi Arabia|Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]]. In order to deal with the demand, the airline leases many different aircraft including [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-200s]], [[Airbus A321]]s, [[Airbus A300]] and [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-400s]].

===State officials transportation===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F009536-0002, Staatspr<U+00E4>sident von Pakistan in M<U+00FC>nchen.jpg|thumb|left|Callsign "PAKISTAN 001" carrying the President on PIA's [[Boeing 707]] photographed in Germany, c.1961]]
PIA has been continuously serving government officials of Pakistan, mainly [[President of Pakistan]] and [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]]. Military and Judicial personnel also enjoy huge discounts on PIA flights. PIA has always transported the President and Prime Minister of Pakistan on overseas visits. During the late 1990s, a PIA [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737<U+2013>300]]<ref>[http://www.airliners.net/open.file/058787/M/ "AP-BEH" PIA B737 in Government Colours]</ref> was used for official visits by the [[Benazir Bhutto|Bhutto]] and [[Nawaz Sharif|Sharif]] governments. The aircraft wore official government colours but was later repainted in the airline official colours at the end of the decade. When the government changed after a [[1999 Pakistani coup d'<U+00E9>tat|military coup in 1999]], the Boeing B737 was transferred to PIA permanently. The President and Prime Minister then resorted to using two of PIA's [[Airbus A310|Airbus A310-300]] for official visits, while rare trips were done on regular commercial flights of the airline. In February 2007 the [[Politics of Qatar|government of Qatar]] gifted one of their VIP fleet [[Airbus A310|A310]]<ref>[http://www.airliners.net/open.file/1201966/M/ Airliners.net: Pakistan Air Force A310-304]</ref> to the Pakistani government, this has ended the need for use of PIA aircraft. However, from time to time the government uses the airline's Boeing 737 or Airbus A310 for official trips. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
