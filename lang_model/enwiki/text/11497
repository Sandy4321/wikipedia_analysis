The '''Sajmi<U+0161>te concentration camp''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|<U+041A><U+043E><U+043D><U+0446><U+0435><U+043D><U+0442><U+0440><U+0430><U+0446><U+0438><U+043E><U+043D><U+0438> <U+043B><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E><U+0440> <U+0421><U+0430><U+0458><U+043C><U+0438><U+0448><U+0442><U+0435>}}, {{lang-de|Judenlager Semlin}}, {{IPA-sh|s<U+00E2>jmi<U+02D0><U+0283>t<U+025B>|pron}}) was a [[Nazi concentration camp]] located on the outskirts of [[Belgrade]], on the territory of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) during [[World War II]]. It was established on 28 October 1941. Intended to detain [[Jews]], [[Serbs]], [[Romani people|Roma]] and others, the camp was run by German ''[[SS-Untersturmf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' [[Herbert Andorfer]], who became notorious for using a [[gas van]] to kill thousands of Jewish inmates. With the extermination of the original Jewish inmates, the camp was renamed "Concentration Camp Zemun" (''Ahhalte Lager'') and served to hold one last group of Jews who were arrested upon the [[surrender of Italy]] in September 1943. During this time it also held captured [[Yugoslav Partisans]], Serbian [[Chetniks]], sympathizers of the Greek and Albanian resistance movements, and Serb peasants from villages in other parts of the NDH. In 1943 and 1944, evidence of atrocities committed in the camp was destroyed by units led by ''[[SS-Standartenf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' [[Paul Blobel]], and thousands of corpses were exhumed from mass graves and incinerated. The camp was closed in July 1944. 

Most of the Germans responsible for the operation of the camp were captured and brought to trial. Several were extradited to [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and executed. Camp commander Herbert Andorfer and his deputy Edgar Enge were arrested in the 1960s after many years of hiding. Both men were subsequently given short prison sentences in [[West Germany]] and [[Austria]], respectively, although Enge's sentence was never carried out due to his age and poor health.

==Background==
The site of the Sajmi<U+0161>te concentration camp had originally been an exhibition centre that had been built by the [[Belgrade]] municipality in the late 1930s in an attempt to attract international commerce. It stood decrepit and empty until the [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]] and occupation of Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Shelach|1989|p=1170}} The Germans then divided the territory of the former Belgrade municipality between Serbia and the newly-formed [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH), with the area where the Sajmi<U+0161>te fairgrounds were located coming under the control of the NDH.{{sfn|Crowe|2000|p=196}} Serbia itself was directly [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|occupied]] by the Germans, who established a military administration in Belgrade. The civilian administration in the country was headed by ''[[SS-Gruppenf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' [[Harald Turner]]. He commanded ''[[Einsatzgruppen]] Serbien''. Originally led by ''[[SS-Standartenf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' [[Wilhelm Fuchs]], and later by ''SS-Gruppenf<U+00FC>hrer'' [[August Meyszner]] with ''SS-Standartenf<U+00FC>hrer'' [[Emanuel Sch<U+00E4>fer]] as his deputy, the group was responsible for ensuring internal security, fighting opponents of the occupation, and dealing with [[Jews]].{{sfn|Shelach|1989|pp=1168&ndash;1169}}
With the German [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], an uprising erupted in Serbia. Although they took no part in the rebellion, Jews were subsequently targeted for retaliatory execution by the Germans. Anti-Jewish laws were quickly implemented by the Germans and by the end of August 1941 all Jewish men in Serbia were interned in concentration camps, primarily at [[Topovske <U+0160>upe]] in Belgrade.{{sfn|Shelach|1989|p=1169}}

==History==

===Establishment===
In the fall of 1941, Turner ordered that all Jewish women and children in Serbia be concentrated in a camp. At first, the Germans considered creating a [[ghetto]] for the Jews in the Gypsy quarter of Belgrade, but this idea was quickly dismissed for it being "too filthy and unhygenic." When several other plans to intern the Jewish and [[Romani people|Romani]] population of Belgrade failed, a concentration camp was established on a [[peninsula]] surrounded on three sides by the [[Sava (river)|Sava]] river. The camp was positioned in a manner which made escape almost impossible. It was located near administrative and police centres, as well as the Belgrade central railway station, which allowed for the efficient transport of Jews to the camp from many towns in the region. Its purpose was to detain Jewish women and children who "endangered" public safety and the [[Wehrmacht]].{{sfn|Shelach|1989|p=1170}} Dubbed "the Jewish camp" in Zemun ({{lang-de|Judenlager Semlin}}), Sajmi<U+0161>te was designed to hold thousands of inmates.{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=33}} It was officially opened on 28 October 1941.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=131}}

===Operation===
Soon after the camp was established, ''[[SS-Scharf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' [[Edgar Enge]] of the Belgrade [[Gestapo]] became its commander.{{sfn|Shelach|1989|p=1174}} At the end of 1941 and the beginning of 1942, approximately 7,000 Jewish women, children and old men were brought to the camp, alongside 500 Jewish men and 292 Romani women and children.{{sfn|Manoschek|2000|pp=178&ndash;179}} Most of these people were from the outlying Serbian towns, primarily [[Ni<U+0161>]], [[Smederevo]] and [[<U+0160>abac]].{{sfn|Shelach|1989|p=1174}} Women and children were placed in makeshift barracks that were barely heated. Consequently, a high number of detainees, especially children, died in the winter of 1941<U+2013>42. The Jewish men detained in the camp, numbering approximately 500, were given the task of running the camp's so-called "self-administration". They were responsible for distributing food, dividing up labour, and organizing a Jewish guard force which patrolled along the camp. The exterior of the camp, however, was guarded on a rotation basis by twenty-five members of Reserve Police Battalion 64.{{sfn|Manoschek|2000|p=179}} 

In January 1942, ''[[SS-Untersturmf<U+00FC>hrer]]'' [[Herbert Andorfer]] was appointed to replace the inexperienced Edgar Enge as commander of the camp. Enge was subsequently made Andorfer's deputy.{{sfn|Shelach|1989|p=1174}} At the beginning of March 1942, Andorfer was informed that a [[gas van]] had been sent to the camp from [[Berlin]]. The vans had been delivered upon the request of the German military administration chief in Serbia, Harald Turner.{{sfn|Manoschek|2000|p=179}} Stricken with guilt over having to play a central role in the murder of these Jews, some of whom he had developed good relations with, Andorfer requested a transfer. This was denied.{{sfn|Glenny|2011|p=505}} In order to ensure the quickness and efficiency of the gassings, he then made announcements to make prisoners believe that they were to be transferred to another, better-equipped camp. He went so far as to post fictitious camp regulations, and announced that prisoners would be allowed to take their bags with them. Many detainees registered for the supposed transfer, hoping to escape the camp's terrible living conditions.{{sfn|Manoschek|2000|p=179}} Inmates who had volunteered to leave the previous evening would climb into the van the next day in groups of between 50 and 80. The drivers of the van, ''SS-Scharf<U+00FC>hrer''s Meier and G<U+00F6>tz, would distribute candy to children in order to win their affection. Afterwards, inmates would climb into the van, whose doors would be sealed shut. The van then followed a small car driven by Andorfer and Enge, before crossing the border into German-occupied Serbia. It was here that inmates were gassed, before being taken to the [[Avala]] shooting range, where they were dumped into freshly-dug mass graves by Serbs imprisoned by the Germans. These gassings became routine, and the gas van would arrive daily, except on Sundays. Rumours quickly began to circulate about the gassings, with news reaching German troops stationed in Belgrade, and even some Serbians.{{sfn|Shelach|1989|pp=1177&ndash;1178}}

When the gassings stopped, few inmates remained in the camp, mostly non-Jewish women who had been married to Jews. They were released several days later, after having been sworn to secrecy. Apart from Sajmi<U+0161>te inmates, the 500 patients and staff of the Belgrade Jewish Hospital, as well as Jewish prisoners from the nearby [[Banjica concentration camp]], were also killed in the gas vans. The last Jewish prisoner in Sajmi<U+0161>te was killed on 8 May 1942, and the gas van used at the camp was returned to Berlin on 9 June 1942. Shortly after exterminating the Jews in Sajmi<U+0161>te, commander Andorfer and his deputy Enge were assigned to different Security Police assignments. Andorfer was subsequently promoted and decorated with an [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class for the role he played in the camp.{{sfn|Shelach|1989|pp=1177&ndash;1179}}

With the extermination of the original Jewish inmates, the camp was renamed "Concentration Camp Zemun" (''Ahhalte Lager'') and served to hold one last group of Jews who were arrested upon the [[surrender of Italy]] in September 1943. During this time it also held captured [[Yugoslav Partisans]], Serbian [[Chetniks]], sympathizers of the Greek and Albanian resistance movements, and Serb peasants from villages in the Croatian [[Usta<U+0161>e]]-controlled regions of [[Srem]] and [[Kozara]], where they had been detained in the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]].{{sfn|Israeli|2013|pp=33&ndash;34}}

===Evacuation===
By the end of 1943, the Germans made an effort to erase all traces of the atrocities committed in the camp by burning records, incinerating corpses, and destroying other evidence.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=131&ndash;132}} This task was undertaken by ''SS-Standartenf<U+00FC>hrer'' [[Paul Blobel]], who arrived in Belgrade in November 1943. Upon arrival, he ordered the head of the local Gestapo, ''[[SS-Sturmbannf<U+00FC>hrer]]'', Bruno Sattler, to form a special detachment that was to be responsible for the exhumation and burning of bodies. The detachment was composed of ten security policemen and 48 military policemen led by Lieutenant [[Erich Grunwald]]. The digging battalions were composed of 100 Serbian and Jewish prisoners. Exhumations occurred from December 1943 to April 1944, and thousands of bodies were burned. All of the prisoners who were present during the exhumations were shot, except for three [[Serbs]] who managed to escape.{{sfn|Shelach|1989|pp=1179&ndash;1180}} The camp was closed in July 1944.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=131}}

==Aftermath==
[[File:Spomenik na Sajmistu.jpg|thumb|A statue constructed in honour of the victims of the camp.]]
Estimates of the number of deaths at the camp vary. The Staro Sajmi<U+0161>te memorial estimates that 23,000 people were killed in the camp, of whom 10,000 were Jews.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=70}} The Yugoslav State War Crimes Commission estimated that as many as 40,000 may have been killed in the camp, including 7,000 Jews.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=131}} Paul Mojzes{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=85}} states that the number may have been as high as 47,000 killed from a total of 92,000 inmates. Most of the Germans who were responsible for the operation of the camp were captured and brought to trial. Many of those who had been prominent German officials during the occupation of Serbia, including Harald Turner, Wilhelm Fuchs and August Meyszner, were extradited to [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] after the war, where they were executed. Camp commander Herbert Andorfer managed to escape with the assistance of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], which helped him flee to [[South America]]. He returned to [[Austria]] from [[Venezuela]] in the 1960s. He was subsequently apprehended and tried on the minor charge of being an accessory to murder, to which he was sentenced to two-and-a-half years imprisonment. Andorfer's deputy, Edgar Enge, was apprehended in the 1960s and sentenced to one-and-a-half years imprisonment. However, his sentence was never carried out due to his old age and poor health. German guards suspected of executing Serbian prisoners were never tried, although they served as witnesses in several trials in [[West Germany]].{{sfn|Shelach|1989|p=1180}}

==Legacy==
At present, the old Sajmi<U+0161>te fairgrounds are marked by a small plaque and a statue to commemorate the camp's victims.{{sfn|''B92''|11 May 2008}} However, no memorial centres or museums have ever been built on the former campgrounds. Today, the area where the camp was located is used as a state-run facility housing low-income residents of Belgrade. It is estimated that as many as 2,500 people presently live on the grounds of the former camp.{{sfn|Salem|2013}}
