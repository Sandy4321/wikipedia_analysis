==Functions==
The British Nutrition Foundation (BNF) is a not-for-profit charity. BNF exists to deliver authoritative, evidence-based information on food and nutrition in the context of health. 

The BNF's core team consists of nutrition scientists and education experts who are passionate about communicating accurate and accessible nutrition messages, which serve to educate and ultimately enable people to make informed diet and lifestyle choices. The team is led by Director General, Professor Judy Buttriss, a highly experienced nutrition scientist.

BNF is independent and impartial. It is a valuable source of credible and accurate information and its work is governed by independent expert science. BNF does not endorse brands, products or services.

BNF's income comes from contracts and donations from government, the European Commission, the food industry and other charities.

==Science programme==
BNF's proactive forward-looking science programme informs and empowers health professionals through updating their knowledge. Its publications, including the highly respected Nutrition Bulletin, and Task Force reports on emerging science are read by health professionals across the disciplines, including nutritionists, dietitians, practice and community nurses, GPs, health visitors, academics, and students.

==Education programme==
BNF works on a wide range of exciting and innovative programmes designed to educate children and young people, aged 3-16+ years, with the vital knowledge and skills they need. The education group provides education professionals with stimulating and engaging resources and teaching tools.

==Communications==
BNF nutrition scientists are available to answer media enquiries and they provide reliable information and unbiased comment on all nutrition issues. Outcomes from the science programme are communicated through a series of high profile publications and events, supported by media relations activities, aimed at disseminating important nutrition messages to the broadest possible audience.

The Foundation has two high profile websites providing up-to-date, accurate and consistent information. The main website, nutrition.org.uk, has recently been relaunched with updated and extended content, improved navigation and a helpful search facility. The education website, foodafactoflife.org.uk, provides extensive teaching and learning resources about food and nutrition.

==Funding==
BNF attracts funding from a variety of sources, including contracts with the European Commission, national government departments and agencies; food producers and manufacturers, retailers and food service companies; grant providing bodies, trusts and other charities. Further details about BNF work, governance and funding can be found on the BNF website (www.nutrition.org.uk) and in their Annual Reports.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/aboutbnf/values/who-we-are-what-we-do|title= Who we are, what we do|year= 2009|publisher= British Nutrition Foundation|location= London|accessdate= 4 April 2011}}</ref>

However, concerns were raised in an article in the British Medical Journal (available [http://spinwatch.org/-articles-by-category-mainmenu-8/40-pr-industry/5353-independence-of-nutritional-information-the-british-nutrition-foundation here]) about the closeness of the links between the BNJ and its funders, which include Tate and Lyle, Unilever, Kraft and Nestle.  

==History==
It was founded in 1967 by Professor Alastair Frazer. In 1973 it held its first annual conference. It is based between [[Holborn tube station|Holborn]] and [[Chancery Lane tube station|Chancery Lane]] tube stations. The BNF programme, ''Food - a fact of life'' was launched in 1991.
