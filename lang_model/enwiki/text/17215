'''German submarine ''U-502''''' was a [[German Type IX submarine#Type IXC|Type IXC]] [[U-boat]] of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' during [[World War II]]. The submarine was laid down on 2 April 1940 at the [[Deutsche Werft]] yard in [[Hamburg]] as 'werk' 292, launched on 18 February 1941 and commissioned on 31 May under the command of ''[[Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant]]'' J<U+00FC>rgen von Rosenstiel. 

She began her service life under training with the [[2nd U-boat Flotilla]] between 31 May and 1 September 1941 before moving on to operations, also with the 2nd flotilla.  ''U-502'' sank fourteen Allied vessels between September 1941 and July 1942 before she was sunk by a British aircraft in the [[Bay of Biscay]].

==Service history==
===1st patrol===
''U-502'' departed [[Kiel]] on 29 September 1941, and ventured out into the mid-Atlantic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/boats/patrols/patrol_1064.html |title=Patrol of U-boat U-502 from 29 Sep 1941 to 9 Nov 1941 - U-boat patrols - uboat.net |publisher=www.uboat.net |accessdate=2010-01-23 }}</ref> On 7 October, south of [[Iceland]], she torpedoed the 14,795 ton British ship ''Svend Foyn'', a straggler from [[HX convoys|Convoy HX-152]] en-route from New York to Liverpool, carrying [[fuel oil]] and aircraft and tanks as deck cargo. The former whale [[factory ship]] was damaged, but managed to escape and assisted by the [[Flower class corvette]] {{HMS|Sunflower|K41|6}}, reached [[Reykjav<U+00ED>k]] on 11 October.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/1147.html |title=Svend Foyn (Whale factory ship) - Ships hit by U-boats - uboat.net |publisher=www.uboat.net |accessdate=2010-01-23 }}</ref> ''U-502'' arrived in [[Lorient]] in occupied France on 9 November.<ref name="patrols"/>

===2nd patrol===
''U-502'' sailed from Lorient on 18 December 1941, but aborted her patrol, having barely left the Bay of Biscay and returned to her French base on the 22nd.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/boats/patrols/patrol_1065.html |title=Patrol of U-boat U-502 from 18 Dec 1941 to 22 Dec 1941 - U-boat patrols - uboat.net |publisher=www.uboat.net |accessdate=2010-01-24 }}</ref>

===3rd patrol===
''U-502''{{'}}s next patrol began on 19 January 1942. She sailed for the Caribbean waters north of [[Venezuela]] to attack the vital [[History of the Venezuelan oil industry|oil trade]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/boats/patrols/patrol_1066.html |title=Patrol of U-boat U-502 from 19 Jan 1942 to 16 Mar 1942 - U-boat patrols - uboat.net |publisher=www.uboat.net |accessdate=2010-01-24 }}</ref>

On the morning of 16 February off the [[Gulf of Venezuela]] she torpedoed and sank three [[oil tanker|tankers]] in as many hours; the British 2,395-ton ''Tia Juana'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/1335.html |title=Tia Juana (Steam tanker) - Ships hit by U-boats - uboat.net |publisher=www.uboat.net |accessdate=2010-01-23 }}</ref> the [[Venezuela]]n 2,650-ton ''Monagas'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/1337.html |title=Monagas (Steam tanker) - Ships hit by U-boats - uboat.net |publisher=www.uboat.net |accessdate=2010-01-23 }}</ref> and then the British 2,391-ton ''San Nicolas''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/1334.html |title=San Nicolas (Steam tanker) - Ships hit by U-boats - uboat.net |publisher=www.uboat.net |accessdate=2010-01-23 }}</ref>

''U-502'' struck again on 22 February near [[Aruba]], sinking the [[United States|American]] 9,033-ton tanker ''J.N. Pew'' with torpedoes during the night,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/1366.html |title=J.N. Pew (Steam tanker) - Ships hit by U-boats - uboat.net |publisher=www.uboat.net |accessdate=2010-01-23 }}</ref> then the [[Panama]]nian 8,329-ton ''Thalia'' with torpedoes and shell-fire that morning.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/1369.html |title=Thalia (Motor tanker) - Ships hit by U-boats - uboat.net |publisher=www.uboat.net |accessdate=2010-01-23 }}</ref> That afternoon she badly damaged the American 9,002-ton ''Sun'' with a single torpedo. The crew initially abandoned ship, but later re-boarded and managed to take her into Aruba to make repairs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/1660.html |title=Sun (Motor tanker) - Ships hit by U-boats - uboat.net |publisher=www.uboat.net |accessdate=2010-01-23 }}</ref> The U-boat returned to Lorient on 16 March after 57 days at sea.<ref name="patrols"/>

===4th patrol===
Her fourth and final patrol was her most productive. Sailing from Lorient on 22 April 1942, she resumed her predations in the [[Caribbean Sea]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/boats/patrols/patrol_1067.html |title=Patrol of U-boat U-502 from 22 Apr 1942 to 6 Jul 1942 - U-boat patrols - uboat.net |publisher=www.uboat.net |accessdate=2010-01-23 }}</ref>

Her first success came  on 11 May, northeast of the [[Virgin Islands]], where she sank the unescorted British 4,963-ton cargo ship ''Cape of Good Hope'' with torpedoes and shell-fire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/1625.html |title=Cape of Good Hope (Motor merchant) - Ships hit by U-boats - uboat.net |publisher=www.uboat.net |accessdate=2010-01-23 }}</ref>

She mistakenly sank the unescorted and [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] 4,996 ton [[Brazil]]ian merchant ship ''Gon<U+00E7>alves Dias'' with two torpedoes about 100 miles south of [[Santo Domingo|Ciudad Trujillo]] on 24 May. The ship was identified as Brazilian only after the attack when the survivors were questioned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/1701.html |title=Gon<U+00E7>alves Dias (Steam merchant) - Ships hit by U-boats - uboat.net |publisher=www.uboat.net |accessdate=2010-01-23 }}</ref> On 28 May, about 150 miles south of the [[Mona Passage]], she sank the unescorted American 6,759-ton [[Type C1 ship]] ''Alcoa Pilgrim'', carrying a cargo of [[bauxite]] ore,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/1717.html |title=Alcoa Pilgrim (Steam merchant) - Ships hit by U-boats - uboat.net |publisher=www.uboat.net |accessdate=2010-01-23 }}</ref> and on 3 June, about 150 miles north-west of [[Trinidad]], she torpedoed the unescorted American 6,940-ton tanker ''M.F. Elliott''. Hit below the waterline, the ship sank within six minutes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/1741.html |title=M.F. Elliott (Steam tanker) - Ships hit by U-boats - uboat.net |publisher=www.uboat.net |accessdate=2010-01-23 }}</ref>

''U-502'' attacked Convoy TO-5, en route from Trinidad to [[Cura<U+00E7>ao]], on 9 June, about 35 miles north-east of Cape Blanco, Venezuela, sinking the [[Belgian]] 5,085-ton merchant ship ''Bruxelles'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/1765.html |title=Bruxelles (Steam merchant) - Ships hit by U-boats - uboat.net |publisher=www.uboat.net |accessdate=2010-01-23 }}</ref> and damaging the American 6,589-ton tanker ''Franklin K. Lane'' to such an extent that it was abandoned and later sunk by gunfire from {{HMS|Churchill|I45|6}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/1766.html |title=Franklin K. Lane (Steam tanker) - Ships hit by U-boats - uboat.net |publisher=www.uboat.net |accessdate=2010-01-23 }}</ref>

On 15 June, ''U-502'' struck once again and sank three ships in a single day. The first, at 01:00, was the unescorted American 8,001-ton merchant ship ''Scottsburg'', hit by two torpedoes about 90 miles west of [[Grenada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/1812.html |title=Scottsburg (Steam merchant) - Ships hit by U-boats - uboat.net |publisher=www.uboat.net |accessdate=2010-01-23 }}</ref> At 04:10, about 100 miles north-west of [[Trinidad]], she sank the unescorted [[Panama]]nian 5,010-ton [[Hog Islander]] ''Cold Harbor'', carrying a cargo of tanks, aircraft and ammunition, with two torpedoes. The first torpedo struck the starboard side causing the ammunition in No.2 hold to explode. About 30 minutes later, a second torpedo struck the port side and the ship sank after 15 minutes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/1809.html |title=Cold Harbor (Steam merchant) - Ships hit by U-boats - uboat.net |publisher=www.uboat.net |accessdate=2010-01-23 }}</ref> Finally, at 20:15 about 30 miles west of Grenada, she sank the unescorted American 5,702 ton ship ''West Hardaway'' with a spread of three torpedoes. Two missed, passing ahead and astern, but the third struck the starboard bow. The ships [[United States Navy Armed Guard|Navy Armed Guard]] returned fire (the ship was armed with a {{convert|4|in|mm|sing=on}} gun, four 20&nbsp;mm guns, and two .30 calibre [[machine gun]]s), but the ship was hit by another torpedo and sank an hour later. All hands abandoned ship and survived.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/1810.html |title=West Hardaway (Steam merchant) - Ships hit by U-boats - uboat.net |publisher=www.uboat.net |accessdate=2010-01-23 }}</ref>

====Sinking====
''U-502'' then headed for her base, but at 04:45 on 6 July in the Bay of Biscay, west of [[La Rochelle]], at position {{coord|46|10|N|06|40|W|dim:400000|display=inline,title}}, she was sunk by depth charges dropped by a [[Leigh light]]-equipped [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington]] bomber of [[No. 172 Squadron RAF]]. All 52 hands were lost. This was the first confirmed kill using a Leigh light.<ref name="uboatnet"/> The pilot of the aircraft [[Pilot Officer|P/O]] Wiley B. Howell, an American volunteer serving in the RAF, was subsequently awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u-boot-archiv.de/dieboote/u0502.html |title=Deutsche U-Boote U-502 |publisher=www.u-boot-archiv.de |accessdate=2010-01-24 }}</ref> Howell later returned to serve in the United States Navy, commanding the carrier {{USS|Bennington|CV-20|2}} in 1965-66.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uss-bennington.org/co-1965Oct12-Capt-Wiley-B-Howell.html |title=Commanding Officers - Captain Wiley B.
