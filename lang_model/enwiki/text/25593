'''Hurricane Bertha''' was a rare early season [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]]. It is both the longest-lived July Atlantic tropical cyclone on record,<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/tws/MIATWSAT_jul.shtml Tropical Weather Summary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and the easternmost forming July [[tropical cyclone|tropical storm]] on record.<ref name="Weather Underground">{{Cite web|author=Jeff Masters|title=Tropical Storm Bertha forms--and sets a record|year=2008|publisher=Wunderground|accessdate=2008-07-06|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=973&tstamp=200807}}</ref> The second named storm of the [[2008 Atlantic hurricane season]], Bertha developed from a [[tropical wave]] that emerged off the coast of Africa on July 1. Tropical Depression Two formed about 250&nbsp;miles (405&nbsp;km) south of [[Cape Verde]]. The system quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Bertha on July 3. Bertha moved westward over the next few days as a weak tropical storm. Late on July 6, Bertha began to strengthen well to the east of the Northern [[Leeward Islands]]. Bertha continued to strengthen and became the first hurricane of the season on July 7, as well as the first major hurricane, later that day.  The hurricane weakened during the day on July 8, due to a nearby upper level low to its northeast.  Thereafter, it drifted north-northwest towards [[Bermuda]] before slowly looping to its southeast on July 12 and July 13.  The system moved within {{convert|40|mi|km}} of Bermuda on July 14 before moving northeast away from the island.  On July 16, Bertha curved back to the southeast due to the influence of a deep [[cyclone]] to its east, and then turned northeast, reaching hurricane strength before becoming extratropical on July 20.

{{storm path|Bertha 2008 track.png}}
Early on July 1, a strong and large [[tropical wave]] emerged off the coast of [[Africa]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Blake|title=July 1 6z Tropical Weather Outlook|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-07-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/text/TWOAT/TWOAT.200807010541.txt |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080804124034/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/text/TWOAT/TWOAT.200807010541.txt <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-08-04}}</ref>  By early the next day, a surface low developed and the wave became better organized.<ref>{{cite web|author=Cangialosi|title=July 2 2:05a EDT Tropical Weather Discussion|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-07-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/text/TWDAT/TWDAT.200807020558.txt |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080804095803/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/text/TWDAT/TWDAT.200807020558.txt <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-08-04}}</ref>  The [[National Hurricane Center]] upgraded the system to Tropical Depression Two in the morning hours of July 3 after the system was able to maintain [[convection]] over its center for at least 12&nbsp;hours.<ref name="02L Discussion 1">{{cite web|author=Blake|title=Tropical Depression Two Advisory 1 Discussion|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-07-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/al02/al022008.discus.001.shtml?}}</ref> The depression organized further and developed two distinct [[Tropical_cyclone#Banding|bands]] of convection.

On July 8 Bertha began to quickly weaken under increasing wind shear and was downgraded to a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane later in the morning. Bertha continued to weaken that afternoon and was downgraded to a weak 75&nbsp;mph Category&nbsp;1 hurricane in the late afternoon, but re-intensified to Category&nbsp;2 the next day. However, on July 10 Bertha was again downgraded to a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane as an eyewall [[File:Bertha July 10 1705 UTC.jpg|thumb|left|Eyewall replacement of Bertha]]replacement cycle had begun.  Movement slowed as steering currents collapsed, and by July 12, Bertha was stationary south-southeast of Bermuda. After barely moving for a full day, Bertha caused an upwelling of cold water which significantly cooled the sea surface temperature beneath it. This cooler water then weakened the hurricane down to strong tropical storm strength.<ref>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCDAT2+shtml/122037.shtml Tropical Storm BERTHA Forecast Discussion<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On July 14 Bertha passed within about {{convert|40|mi|km}} of Bermuda.<ref>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/al02/al022008.public_a.046.shtml Tropical Storm BERTHA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  After moving off to Bermuda's northeast, a deep cyclone east of Bertha forced the [[tropical cyclone]] on a southeasterly track on July 16.

==Preparations==
On July 7, Bermuda residents began purchasing lamps, tarpaulins and flashlights in anticipation of Hurricane Bertha. In the sudden rush, some stores sold out of batteries.<ref name="BermudaSun_July9">{{Cite journal|author=Staff Writer|publisher=Bermuda Sun|title=No Title|page=A1|date=2008-07-09}}</ref> [[Bermuda]] [[Public Safety|Public Safety Minister]] Senator David Burch called a meeting of the island's Emergency Measures Organisation for the night of July 9.

==Impact==
As a tropical storm, Bertha dropped rainfall over the southern Cape Verde islands. No damages or deaths were reported.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rhome|title=Tropical Storm Bertha Public Advisory #4|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-07-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/al02/al022008.public.004.shtml?}}</ref>

All flights into and out of Bermuda were disrupted on July 14 as the storm made its final approach to the island. [[JetBlue]] and [[Delta Air Lines]] canceled their flights while [[American Airlines]] flew its Miami and New York flights a day early, escaping before the tropical storm arrived. [[British Airways]] delayed its flight to the afternoon, hoping that the storm would have passed by the time its plane arrives.<ref name="The_RG_July14">{{cite web|author=Amanda Dale|publisher=The Royal Gazette|title=Bertha loses strength|accessdate=2008-07-14|date=2008-07-14|url=http://www.theroyalgazette.com/siftology.royalgazette/Article/article.jsp?articleId=7d8772b30030003&sectionId=48}}</ref><ref name="bda_sun_july14">{{cite web|author=Don Burgess|publisher=The Bermuda Sun|title=Flights cancelled as storm buffets Bermuda|accessdate=2008-08-14|date=2008-08-14|url=http://www.bermudasun.bm/main.asp?SectionID=24&SubSectionID=270&ArticleID=38261}}</ref> Ferry service to St. Georges was canceled for the whole day,<ref name="The_RG_July14"/> and all other routes outside of Hamilton Harbour were canceled after their morning runs.<ref name="bda_sun_july14_2">{{cite web|author=Tim Hall|publisher=Bermuda Sun|accessdate=2008-07-14|date=2008-07-14|title=Causeway expected to remain open; buses to keep running|url=http://www.bermudasun.bm/main.asp?FromHome=1&TypeID=1&ArticleID=38262&SectionID=24&SubSectionID=270}}</ref> Some roads flooded, and tree branches were broken around the island. The wind downed power lines, causing scattered power outages, but engineers from the [[Bermuda Electric Light Company]] were reattaching cables immediately, even during the height of the storm.<ref name="bda_sun_july14_2"/>

Even as Bertha was passing to the east of the island and delivering tropical storm force winds, worries that it might re-strengthen to a hurricane before clearing the island prompted the government of Bermuda to issue a hurricane watch.<ref>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/al02/al022008.update.07141855.shtml Tropical Storm BERTHA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  A total of {{convert|4.77|in|mm}} of rainfall fell at their international airport.<ref>[[David M.

The hurricane produced strong waves and rip currents along the [[East Coast of the United States]], which caused three deaths along the coastline of [[New Jersey]]. On July&nbsp;12, a 51-year old man died after suddenly losing consciousness during his rescue. On July&nbsp;13, three men swam out to a buoy about 300&nbsp;ft (91.4&nbsp;m) off the coast of [[Wildwood, New Jersey|Wildwood Beach]] when they were overcome by the rough surf. One swimmer was found unconscious in the water and pronounced dead at the scene, the second was never found and presumed dead, and the third was rescued.
