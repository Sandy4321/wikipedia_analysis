The '''Canadian Security Intelligence Service''' ('''CSIS''')  ({{lang-fr|Service canadien du renseignement de s<U+00E9>curit<U+00E9>}}) (''SCRS'') is [[Canada]]'s national [[intelligence service]]. It is responsible for collecting, analyzing, reporting and disseminating [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] on threats to Canada's [[national security]], and conducting operations, [[covert operation|covert]] and overt, within Canada and abroad.<ref name="CSISWEB">{{cite web|url=http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/bts/rlfcss-eng.asp |title=Role of CSIS |publisher=Csis-scrs.gc.ca |date=2009-04-09 |accessdate=2010-07-24}}</ref>

Its headquarters are located at 1941 Ogilvie Road, in [[Ottawa, Ontario]], in a purpose-built facility completed in 1995.<ref>[http://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/domino/reports.nsf/html/9608ce.html ]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref>  CSIS ({{pronEng|<U+02C8>si<U+02D0>s<U+026A>s}}) is responsible to [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] through the [[Minister of Public Safety]], but is also overseen by the [[Federal Court of Canada|Federal Court]] system, the [[Inspector General]] of CSIS, and the [[Security Intelligence Review Committee]].<ref>http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/en/about_us/accountability.asp</ref>

==History==
CSIS was created on June 21, 1984 by an [[Parliament of Canada|Act of Parliament]] passed as a consequence of the [[McDonald Commission]].<ref>[http://www.ps-sp.gc.ca/prg/ns/airs/rep1-4-eng.aspx The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] and CSIS: Background]</ref> The main thrust of the McDonald Report was that security intelligence work should be separated from policing, and that the activities of a new agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, should be subject to both judicial approval for warrants, as well as general oversight review by a new body, the [[Security Intelligence Review Committee]], as well as the office of the Inspector General. Its ''[[de facto]]'' existence began on July 16 under the direction of [[Ted Finn|Thomas D'Arcy Finn]].<ref>http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/en/about_us/history_artifacts/history/brf_csis_index.asp</ref> Before this, Canadian intelligence had been under the jurisdiction of the [[RCMP Security Service|Royal Canadian Mounted Police Security Service]].

During the [[Cold War]], the CSIS was tasked with tracking down foreign spies in Canada, relying heavily on the use of "technological gadgets"  to uncover espionage activities<ref>http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/hstrrfcts/rtfcts/index-eng.asp</ref>{{Dead link|date=October 2010}}. More recently, it has engaged in [[counter-espionage]] operations against alleged [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] intelligence activities throughout Canada<ref>[http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=ca90416e-fe77-4b8d-ae59-a4e9f55b6441&k=26688 Government vows to curb Chinese spying on Canada]</ref>{{Failed verification|date=October 2010}}<!--source does not state "engaged in counter-espionage operations, this seems like speculation-->.

==Mission and operations==

CSIS is Canada's lead agency for [[national security]] matters. It is a federal agency which conducts national security investigations and security intelligence collection at home and abroad.<ref name="CSISWEB" /> CSIS collects and analyzes intelligence and advises the Government of Canada on issues and activities that may threaten the security of Canada. CSIS also conducts security investigations and assessments for all applicants seeking a security clearance with federal departments and agencies, with the exception of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) who conduct their own security assessments.

There is no restriction in the CSIS Act on where CSIS may collect "security intelligence" or information relating to threats to the security of Canada. The agency may collect information on threats to Canada or Canadians from anywhere in the world. While CSIS is often viewed as a defensive ''security intelligence'' agency it is not a domestic agency. CSIS officers work domestically and internationally in their efforts to monitor and counter threats to Canadian security.

There is a distinction between "security intelligence" and "foreign intelligence". Security intelligence pertains to national security threats (e.g., [[terrorism]], [[espionage]]). Foreign intelligence involves information collection relating to the political, or economic activities of foreign states. According to Section 16 of the CSIS Act, the agency collects this type of "foreign intelligence" within Canada.

CSIS is neither a police agency nor is it a part of the military. As an intelligence agency, the primary role of CSIS is not law enforcement. Investigation of criminal activity is left to the RCMP and local (provincial, regional or city) police agencies. CSIS, like counterparts such as the [[United Kingdom]] [[Secret Intelligence Service]] ([[MI6]]), the domestic British Security Service ([[MI5]]) and the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), is a civilian agency. CSIS is subject to review by the Security Intelligence Review Committee (SIRC) and an Inspector General (IG) as well as other legislative checks and balances. The agency carries out its functions in accordance with the CSIS Act, which governs and defines its powers and activities.

Canadian police, military agencies (see [[Intelligence Branch (Canadian Forces)|Canadian Forces Intelligence Branch]]), and numerous other government departments may maintain their own "intelligence" components (i.e. to analyze criminal intelligence or military strategic intelligence). The [[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade]] maintains a Security and Intelligence Bureau to review and analyze overtly acquired information.  The bureau plays a coordinating and policy role. While not an intelligence agency, it is responsible for the security of Department of Foreign Affairs personnel around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stenotran.com/commission/maherarar/2005-05-17%20volume%2011.pdf |title=P:\Commissions of Inquiry\Maher Arar\2005-05-17 volume 11.wpd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-07-24}}</ref> However, these agencies are not to be confused with the more encompassing work of larger more dedicated "intelligence agencies" such as CSIS, MI5, MI6, or the CIA.

The ''Operational Programs'' of CSIS include:
*[[Counter-terrorism]]
*[[Counter-proliferation]]
*[[Counter-intelligence]]
*[[Security clearance#Canada|Security screening]]
*Research, Analysis and Production (creating strategy for the implementation of the Operational Programs)
*[[Environmental scanning]]

*Facing Technological Challenges
CSIS works closely with the intelligence agencies of the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Australia]]. Under the post<U+2013>World War II [[Quadripartite Agreement (1947)|Quadpartite Pact]] all intelligence information is shared between the intelligence agencies of these four countries.

Permission to put a subject under surveillance is granted by the [[Target Approval and Review Committee]].

[[Security Liaison Officer]]s (SLOs) of CSIS are posted at Canadian embassies and consulates to gather security-related intelligence from other nations. This information may be gathered from other national intelligence agencies, law enforcement services and other sources. SLOs also assess potential immigrants to Canada for security issues.

CSIS has been named one of "[[Canada's Top 100 Employers]]" by Mediacorp Canada Inc. for the years of 2009-2011, and was featured in ''[[Maclean's]]'' newsmagazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eluta.ca/top-employer-canadian-security-intelligence-service|title=Reasons for Selection, 2009 Canada's Top 100 Employers Competition}}</ref>

==Oversight==
The activities of CSIS are regularly reviewed on behalf of Parliament by the [[Security Intelligence Review Committee]] (SIRC). It is also under the portfolio of the federal [[Minister of Public Safety (Canada)]], whose Inspector General compiles an annual classified report on CSIS' operational activities for the Minister. Both SIRC and the CSIS IG have access to all CSIS information, classified and open, with the exception of Cabinet Confidences.

==Controversies==
CSIS has at times come under criticism, such as for its role in the investigation of the 1985 [[Air India Flight 182|Air India bombing]]. The Commission of Inquiry into the Investigation of the Bombing of Air India
Flight 182, headed by Mr. Justice John Major, is underway. Two Canadian courts have publicly criticized CSIS for destroying [[wiretap]] evidence. One court impressed upon the importance of wiretap evidence from CSIS in establishing guilt. The second focused on its [[exculpatory]] value.

From 1988 to 1994, CSIS mole [[Grant Bristow]] infiltrated the Canadian white-supremacist movement.  When the story became public knowledge, the press aired concerns that he had not only been one of the founders of the [[Heritage Front]] group, but that he had also channelled CSIS funding to the group.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/world/canada-s-security-agency-accused-of-spying-on-canadians.html Canada's Security Agency Accused of Spying on Canadians], ''New York Times''</ref>

In 1999, [[classified document]]s were stolen from the car of a CSIS employee who was attending a [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] [[Ice hockey|hockey]] game. The [[Security Intelligence Review Committee]] reportedly investigated this incident.<ref>''Edited [[Hansard]]'' (Debates of the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] of Canada), 36th Parliament, 2nd Session, Number 20, 15 November 1999, 1425 [http://www.parl.gc.ca/36/2/parlbus/chambus/house/debates/020_1999-11-15/han020_1425-e.htm#LINK95]</ref><ref>''Edited [[Hansard]]'' (Debates of the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] of Canada), 36th Parliament, 2nd Session, Number 22, 17 November 1999, 1455 [http://www.parl.gc.ca/36/2/parlbus/chambus/house/debates/022_1999-11-17/han022_1455-e.htm#LINK122]</ref>

On September 18, 2006, the Arar Commission absolved CSIS of any involvement in the [[extraordinary rendition]] by the United States of a Canadian citizen, [[Maher Arar]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The Commission found that U.S. authorities sent Arar to [[Jordan]] and then [[Syria]] (his country of birth) based on incorrect information which had been provided by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) to the U.S. government. Arar was held by the Syrians for one year and was tortured. The sole criticism of CSIS levelled by the Commission was that the agency should do more to vet information provided by regimes which practice [[torture]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

On March 31, 2009, CSIS lawyer and advisor Geoffrey O'Brian told the [[Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security|Committee on Public Safety and National Security]] that CSIS would use information obtained by torture if it could prevent another attack such as [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] or the Air India bombing.  Testifying before the same committee two days later, Director of CSIS Jim Judd said that O'Brian "may have been confused" and "venturing into a hypothetical", and would send the committee a clarifying letter.<ref>[http://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/612514 Official misspoke; CSIS says it's not involved in torture]</ref>  Two weeks later, the CSIS announced that Judd would be retiring in June, five months before the end of his five-year term.<ref>[http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/618623 Head of CSIS stepping down]</ref>
