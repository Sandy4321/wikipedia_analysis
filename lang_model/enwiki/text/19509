== Legal Theory ==

In an article<ref> Adrian Howe, A <U+2018>Right to Passions<U+2019>?  Compassion<U+2019>s Sexed Asymmetry and a Minor Comedy of Errors, Law & Critique (2012), vol 23, pp 83-102.</ref> in the journal [[Law and Critique|''Law & Critique'']], the feminist scholar [//www.griffith.edu.au/criminology-law/griffith-law-school/staff/adrian-howe Adrian Howe] examines how Heinze has innovated within [[Critical theory|critical theory]] to offer alternative readings of [[William Shakespeare]]. Citing the example of [[The Comedy of Errors]], Howe explains how, well into the 20th century, scholars often thought that Shakespeare would not have sought to convey a serious socio-legal critique in a seemingly frivolous play.  Heinze, according to Howe, uncovers a <U+201C>range of socio-legal dualisms; master<U+2013>servant, husband<U+2013>wife, native<U+2013>alien, parent<U+2013>child, monarch<U+2013>parliament, buyer<U+2013>seller.  The Comedy, [Heinze] argues, deploys concepts of <U+2018>comedy<U+2019> and <U+2018>error<U+2019> to reflect problematic socio-legal relationships that are based on traditional but changing models of socio-legal domination and subordination.<U+201D><ref>Howe, A <U+2018>Right to Passions<U+2019>?, ''op. cit.'', p 98.</ref>
Howe adds that, on Heinze<U+2019>s reading, <U+201C>it is the viewpoint of the privileged male that is challenged in the play.<U+201D><ref>Howe, A <U+2018>Right to Passions<U+2019>?, ''op. cit.'', p 99.</ref>
== Free Speech ==

In the area of human rights, Heinze has frequently challenged Western European restrictions on [[freedom of speech]], as embodied in so-called "[[hate speech]]" bans. Heinze argues that a modern [[democracy]] has more effective and more legitimate ways of combating social intolerance, without having to restrict speech within the [[public sphere]]<ref>Kay Goodall, Human Rights Pitted Against Man (II) - A Response, ''International Journal of Human Rights'', 14(7), 2010, 1165-1184</ref>. According to the free speech expert [[Eric Barendt]], Heinze identifies further problems of coherence within hate speech bans. Barendt writes that the bans, according to Heinze<U+2019>s critique, <U+201C>are often justified as necessary to prevent discrimination against the targeted racial or other groups.  But in fact they themselves discriminate between the groups protected by hate speech laws ([[Minority group|racial, ethnic, religious groups and gays]]) and those left unprotected (other cultural groups, the physically and mentally [[disability|disabled]], [[transsexualism|transsexuals]]).<U+201D><ref>Eric Barendt, Religious Hatred Laws: Protecting Groups or Belief?, ''Res Publica'' (2011), vol 17, pp 41-53.</ref>
== Sexuality ==

Heinze has also written on problems of [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and human rights. [//www.law.uky.edu/index.php?hid=100 James M. Donovan] summarises<ref>James M Donovan, Baby Steps or One Fell Swoop?, ''California Western Law Review'', vol 38 (2001), pp 1-62.</ref> some of Heinze<U+2019>s criticisms of [[international organization|international organisations]]. Donovan notes that, on Heinze<U+2019>s view, <U+201C>the failure to include [[sexual orientation]] within the [[United Nations]] human rights agenda, by the late 20th century, had resulted not merely in the exclusion of sexual orientation, but in a further mystification of it, which in turn was used to justify its continued exclusion.<U+201D><ref>Donovan, Baby Steps or One Fell Swoop?, ''op cit.'', p 31.</ref> For Jennifer Wilson<ref>Jennifer Wilson, Horizontal Versus Vertical Compromise in Securing LGBT Civil Rights, ''Texas Journal of Women and the Law'', vol 18, pp 125-44.</ref>, Heinze<U+2019>s view in particular explains <U+201C>the exclusion of transgender people from anti-discrimination laws.<U+201D><ref>Wilson, Horizontal Versus Vertical Compromise, ''op cit.'' P 137</ref> The Norwegian human rights expert [[Dag_%C3%98istein_Endsj%C3%B8|Dag <U+00D8>istein Endsj<U+00F8>]] explains that, according to Heinze, the absence of any specific reference to sexual orientation or identity in earlier international human rights instruments <U+201C>does not mean that [sexual minorities<U+2019>] fundamental rights are excluded from protection by these conventions.<U+201D><ref>Dag <U+00D8>istein Endsj<U+00F8>, Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights and the religious relativism of human rights, ''Human Rights Review'', vol 6:2, (2005), pp. 102-10.</ref>
[//staff.lincoln.ac.uk/sobendorf Simon Obendorf] argues<ref>Simon Obendorf, Homosexual Rights and the Non-Western World, ''Third World Legal Studies'', 1998-99, pp 179-204.</ref> that <U+201C>homosexual rights are indeed worthy of protection at [[international law]]<U+201D><ref>Simon Obendorf, Homosexual Rights and the Non-Western World, ''op cit.'', pp 180-81.</ref>, but questions <U+201C>Eric Heinze<U+2019>s calls for a treaty-based instrument to codify and enforce principles of non-discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in international law.<U+201D><ref>Simon Obendorf, Homosexual Rights and the Non-Western World, ''op cit.'', p 180.</ref> Obendorf challenges<ref>Simon Obendorf, Homosexual Rights and the Non-Western World, op cit., p 199.</ref> the concept of <U+201C>sexual minorities<U+201D> which Heinze, in his book ''Sexual Orientation: A Human Right'', defines as <U+201C>people whose sexual orientation derogates from a dominant heterosexual norm.<U+201D><ref>Eric Heinze, ''Sexual Orientation: A Human Right'', Dordrecht: Nijhoff (1995), p 295.</ref>

::<U+201C>In this game, post-colonial regimes bolster their domestic authority by promoting nationalist campaigns based on ideas about sexuality, which depict minority sexual orientations as manifestations of Western decadence.  Resistance to any programme of tolerance towards homosexuality is said to be rooted in <U+2018>ancient<U+2019> and <U+2018>indigenous<U+2019> traditions.  Heinze also notes the tendency of western states to eagerly demonstrate that they are not imposing a <U+2018>first world<U+2019> agenda on <U+2018>traditional<U+2019> societies.  As a consequence, there has been a self-censoring forbearance in challenging southern states, as a kind of deference to indigenous cultural beliefs. In short, Heinze complains that many western states have been willing to tolerate human rights relativity in the context of sexuality.<U+201D><ref name="BlakeDayle" />

== Politics of International Human Rights ==

Heinze<U+2019>s criticisms of international law and institutions have also reached beyond the specific issues of free speech and sexuality. In other writing, he examines how inter-governmental and non-governmental organisations become politicised, therefore failing to adhere to their own professed mandates. According to [//www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/law/freedman-rosa.aspx Rosa Freedman], Heinze explains how states members of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], as well as its predecessor, the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|UN Human Rights Commission]] have used [[voting bloc|bloc voting]] to ensure an entrenched and systemic <U+201C>sidelining<U+201D> of attention away from the gravest human rights situations.<ref>Rosa Freedman, ''The United Nations Human Rights Council: A critique and early assessment'' (London: Routledge, 2013), p. 141.</ref>

(Section to be removed upon approval)
I've come to know of Eric Heinze through his published works, and feel that he is an academic of sufficient standing to merit his own entry on this site. My latest attempt to be less 'essay-like' has involved redacting a lot of what might be perceived as less objective in an effort to make the entry as encyclopaedia-like as I can.
