'''Delbert Daisey''' (born March 6, 1924 in [[Virginia]]), known as '''Cigar Daisey''', is an [[United States|American]] [[waterfowl]] [[Wood carving|wood carver]].  He lives and works in [[Chincoteague, Virginia|Chincoteague]], Virginia and is the resident carver at the [[Refuge Waterfowl Museum]].<ref name=Outlaw_Hunters>Collins, Dennis.  "Former Outlaw Hunters Carving Out New Lives", ''The Washington Post'', April 13, 1982, p. C3.</ref>  His decoy carvings are recognized for both their artist value and functionality as working pieces for [[waterfowl hunting]].  His works include [[American Black Duck|Black Ducks]], [[Mallard]]s, [[Redhead (duck)|Redheads]], [[Ruddy Duck|Ruddys]] and [[Red-breasted Merganser]]s and often crafted in drake (male) and hen (female) pairs.  He has carved about 1900 ducks in total and he generally uses cork or wood as his medium.  He carved his first duck out of balsa wood in 1940 at his father's wood shop.  The [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] has his works in their collection.  He earned his nickname in 1945 while leaving cigar butts to taunt game wardens while poaching ducks on [[Assateague Island]].<ref name=30,000>Harden, Blaine.  "Killer of 30,000 Ducks", ''The Washington Post'', August 11, 1979, p. D2.</ref>  Later in life, Daisey was an avid conservationist.<ref name=30,000/>

The best decoy he has ever made was a pintail he made in 1973 for a present for his wife. That is the only fully decorative decoy he has ever made.The decoy was featured in National Geographic in June 1980 page 826.  The decoy is estimated to be worth $150,000.{{fact|date=March 2013}}
