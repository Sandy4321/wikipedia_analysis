{{in-universe}}
'''Captain America's shield''' is a [[fictional]] item, the primary defensive and offensive piece of equipment used by the [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Captain America]], and he is seldom seen without it. Over the years, Captain America has had the use of several different [[shield]]s of varying composition and design.

=Fictional history=
==The original shield==
[[Image:Captainamerica1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Captain America with his first, triangular shield, from ''Captain America Comics'' #1 (March 1941), art by Jack Kirby.]]
In his first appearance in ''Captain America Comics'' #1, published by Timely Comics prior to the [[United States]]' entry into [[World War II]], and as designed by [[Jack Kirby]], Captain America (secretly [[Private (rank)|Private]] Steve Rogers) was equipped with a triangular, badge-shaped shield. This original shield was said to be made from a bulletproof alloy. After complaints by rival comic book publisher MLJ that the shield design was too similar to that of their own patriotic hero [[The Shield (Archie)|the Shield]], the triangular shield was replaced by a [[discus]]-shaped one.

While the origin and fate of the badge shield were never described in the original comics, decades later the story would be told through [[retcon|retroactive continuity]]. According to this, the original triangular shield was given by Captain America to King T<U+2019>Chaka (father of T<U+2019>Challa, the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]) of the fictional isolated African country [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]] as a pledge that the nation would remain uninvolved in the rest of the war. The original shield still resides in Wakanda as a national treasure. 

A second triangular shield was given to him upon his return from that country, and Rogers would use this until given his disc-shaped shield which was personally presented by President [[Franklin Roosevelt]]. This second triangular shield was kept in storage with Rogers' other personal effects after the war. It was recovered at some point after Rogers joined the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and kept at [[Avengers Mansion]]. However, it was destroyed by the villain [[Mr. Hyde (comics)|Mr. Hyde]] during a raid on the mansion by [[Baron Zemo|Baron Zemo<U+2019>s]] [[Masters of Evil]] (later "plucked from time" and restored by Baron Zemo in ''Thunderbolts'' #105). A third triangular shield was kept in the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and would very briefly be used by Rogers years later after he helped clear out a [[HYDRA]] attack on the Institute itself.

Yet another of the triangular shields is currently being used by [[Patriot (comics)#Elijah Bradley|Elijah Bradley]], the teenage hero known as the Patriot and leader of the [[Young Avengers]].

==The indestructible shield==

The circular shield most associated with Captain America made its debut in ''Captain America Comics'' #2. A concave metal disc, it is virtually indestructible and has remained his most constant shield over the decades.

Again through retroactive continuity, it was established that the shield was presented to Rogers by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].<ref name="stern origin">''Captain America'' #255 (March 1981)</ref> The shield was created by an American [[metallurgist]] named [[Dr. Myron MacLain]], who had been commissioned by the US government to create an indestructible armor material to aid the war effort. MacLain experimented with [[vibranium]], an alien metal found only in [[Wakanda]] that had unique vibration absorption properties. 

During one of his experiments to fuse vibranium with an experimental steel alloy (the other metal in the steel alloy is described by some sources as [[titanium]]), MacLain fell asleep and woke to find the experiment a success. However, this was due to an unknown [[catalyst]] entering the process during his slumber, and he was unable to duplicate the result. The vibranium-steel alloy mix was then poured into a mold for a [[tank]]'s upper hatch to create the disc shape and painted to become Captain America's symbol. 

Rogers' indestructible shield has often been referred to as being an [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]]-vibranium alloy. This is not the case: adamantium was only developed after Rogers was revived from [[suspended animation]], during MacLain's later experiments to try and duplicate the material of the shield (the substance made its first appearance in ''Avengers'' Vol. 1 #66, July 1969). 

The adamantium-vibranium error first arose in the Captain America entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' (the composition of the shield was described in the adamantium entry as "vibranium-iron") and was propagated in several subsequent stories by writers using the Handbook as a reference. The error was corrected in ''Captain America'' #303-304 (March-April 1985), which established that the shield is made of vibranium and an "experimental steel alloy", but that did not prevent the error's repetition over the years.

The vibranium in the shield is what absorbs virtually all of the kinetic impact from any blows that the shield receives, allowing it to withstand incredible amounts of force without injuring Rogers in the process. The vibranium is also a likely factor in the way Rogers throws his shield: he often uses it to ricochet around a room and strike various opponents with little loss of velocity in its forward movement after each impact.

When Rogers returned from suspended animation, [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] "improved" the shield by incorporating electronic and magnetic components in it so that Rogers could even control it in flight. However, Rogers soon discarded the additional components because he found that it upset the balance of the shield when thrown, which was Rogers' ultimate preference.

During his early years in the Avengers, when it was not firmly established that the discus-shaped shield was indestructible, the shield was destroyed or lost several times in the comics, to return with no explanation. It was retconned that these were steel replicas, with the actual shield being borrowed by Stark for analysis and returned to Rogers later.

===Destroying the indestructible===
To date, the shield has been damaged or destroyed three times. On each of these occasions, the shield was subjected to a cosmically powerful force capable of reshaping matter on a massive scale. Specifically, the powers that affected the shield were:

* The [[Molecule Man]]'s total control over matter<ref name="molecule">''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #215-216 (Jan.-Feb. 1982)</ref>
* The godlike power of the [[Beyonder]]<ref>''[[Secret Wars]]'' #11 (Mar. 1985)</ref>
* The omnipotence conferred by the [[Infinity Gauntlet]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

On another occasion, the shield is damaged by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] using the power of the [[Odin (comics)|Odinforce]] during a storyline in which Thor, as ruler of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] teleports Asgard to Earth, hovering magically above [[New York City]]. Captain America engages Thor in battle and is killed after Thor uses the Odinforce to incinerate part of the shield.<ref>''Thor'' vol.2 #73 (Mar.    2004)</ref> However, this incident is ultimately revealed to have taken place in an alternate reality and timeline.

====The Molecule Man====
On the first occasion, the [[Molecule Man]] disintegrated the shield, along with [[Mjolnir (comics)|Thor's hammer]], Iron Man's armor, and the [[Silver Surfer]]'s board. After he did so, he commented that the board's molecules were "weird", and while there were "odd forces interweaving" among the hammer's molecules, the shield was "weirdest of all". He later reassembled these items, with the exception of the armor, as the electronic circuits were too complicated for him to understand.<ref name="molecule"/>

====The power of the Beyonder====
During the ''[[Secret Wars]]'' limited series, the shield was partially destroyed by [[Doctor Doom]], who had stolen the power of the godlike being known as the [[Beyonder]]. When the Beyonder reclaimed its power, a temporary side effect granted the desires of the heroes on a small scale (such as allowing the doors in the heroes' base to open to [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Connors]]). Rogers used this "wish effect" to reconstruct the shield. However, this would have repercussions years later.

When Rogers dropped his shield in the middle of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] during an adventure, the shield sank to the bottom, seemingly lost forever, and he used several replacement shields for some months. A recovery team working for Tony Stark managed to retrieve the shield from the ocean floor, but when it was dropped on the deck of the ship, it shattered into dozens of pieces.

Examining the pieces, Rogers and Stark discovered that when Rogers put the shield back together with the Beyonder's energies, a small submolecular imperfection was introduced into the vibranium: one solitary molecule was left out of alignment. With each additional impact over the years, the misalignment spread to neighboring molecules, steadily growing until the molecular bonds of the shield were completely broken down and it shattered. However, the consequences were far graver, as the shattering of the shield did not stop this chain reaction; the instability continued to grow, creating a vibranium "cancer", a shockwave that was propagating throughout the world, violently detonating any vibranium it found, from mineral deposits to vibranium used in the construction of ships and equipment. The shockwave was traveling to the Great Vibranium Mound in Wakanda, where the resulting explosion could destroy the world. 

To prevent this, Rogers travelled to Wakanda with the pieces of the shield taped together, prepared to sacrifice what remained of it in an attempt to absorb the shockwave. However, the villain [[Klaw]] (who was made up of living sound waves) had reached Wakanda ahead of him. Klaw stood in the path of the shockwave, absorbing it himself and increasing his own powers considerably. When Klaw next attacked Rogers, the latter instinctively raised the taped-together shield in defense. When Klaw struck the shield, his shockwave-augmented power realigned its vibranium molecules and restored the shield. Rogers then defeated Klaw.

====The Infinity Gauntlet====
During the ''[[Infinity Gauntlet]]'' storyline, [[Thanos]] (who possessed relative [[omnipotence]] via the Infinity Gauntlet) shattered the shield with a blow of his fist while in combat with Captain America. The shield was soon restored by Thanos' alleged granddaughter, [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], when she obtained the Gauntlet and used it to undo the death and destruction that Thanos had caused over the previous twenty-four hours. Although Nebula's actions are sometimes described as having turned back time or altered the past so that Thanos' acts of destruction never occurred, this is unlikely, as not all of the events that occurred during the twenty-four hour timeframe (including some other actions committed by Thanos) were undone.

==Future and alternate versions==
Given its powerful symbolism, the indestructible shield has been shown in many alternate futures of the Marvel Universe.

* In the future timeline of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]], the shield was used by [[Vance Astro|Major Victory]] in battle; he later passed it to the new government of his war-torn Earth's former United States as a rallying symbol.

* In the "[[Future Imperfect (comics)|Future Imperfect]]" setting, where the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] became the [[Maestro (comics)|Maestro]] and was both the last surviving superbeing and a despotic ruler, an ancient [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] assembled a trophy room as a tribute to the fallen heroes, with the shield among them. Jones used the shield to defend against one of the Maestro's blows, but the impact was too powerful for even it to absorb. Jones was sent flying back and was impaled on [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine's]] skeleton. When the Hulk, plucked from the past, threw the shield to attack his future self, he managed to injure the Maestro, causing a large scar on his chest as he attempted to cut the Maestro in half. Throwing the Hulk off, the Maestro attempted to hit Hulk with the shield himself, commenting that Rogers could never throw the shield hard enough to do him any damage, but the Hulk deflected it with the [[Silver Surfer]]'s old board. After the battle, Jones was cremated; the Hulk poured Jones's ashes over the shield, affixing it with an epoxy, and then threw it into space, hoping that it would land somewhere exciting.

* In the alternate reality shown in ''[[What If (comics)|What If...?]]'' #114, where the heroes and villains were unable to leave Battleworld at the conclusion of the [[Secret Wars]], the shield was passed on to the daughter of Captain America and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] (Albeit a Rogue being controlled by [[Ms. Marvel]]'s personality).

* In the [[MC2]] timeline, [[Sharon Carter|Sharon Carter's]] daughter, Shannon, joined [[A-Next]] (that timeline's version of the Avengers) and took the alias of American Dream. She also used a version of the indestructible shield that belonged to the deceased counterpart of Captain America on an Earth on which the Red Skull came to power. Later the MC2 version of Captain America died saving the world; his spirit and body, including his shield, were turned into a new star by Thor, the star resembling his shield, where it would forever shine to inspire new generations of heroes.

* [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] claims to have borne the shield into battle many times during his early adulthood, far in the future.

*Also, in the ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' crossover comic series, in the final issue, Captain America lets [[Superman]] wield his shield in battle, despite their bitter rivalry in the previous issue.

* In the closing of the [[March 12]], [[2007]] episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Stephen Colbert]] read a letter from [[Joe Quesada]] in response to Colbert's earlier comments toward Captain America. He was then presented with what was said to be Captain America's indestructible shield, reportedly willed to Colbert in the event of his death.<ref>http://www.comedycentral.com/motherload/index.jhtml?ml_video=83567</ref>

==Other shields==
[[Image:Capenergyshield.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Captain America brandishing his photonic energy shield. Cover for Captain America Vol. 3 #9, by [[Andy Kubert]]]]
*While Rogers was asleep in suspended animation, three other men used the identity of Captain America, all using steel replicas of the discus shield. The last, 1950s Captain America was also placed in suspended animation after becoming mentally unstable. When he was revived years later, Rogers had awoken and the two clashed, and the 1950s Captain America's shield was broken during this fight. 

*In the 1980s, in a story written by [[Mark Gruenwald]], Rogers chose to resign his identity rather than submit to the orders of the United States government and took the alias of "The Captain" instead. This extended story arc was intended to illustrate the difference of Captain America's beliefs from his replacement who was intended to illustrate the jingoistic attitude that the popular movie character [[Rambo]] embodied and which Rogers did not share. During this period, the role of Captain America was assumed by John Walker, the former Super-Patriot, who used both the costume and the indestructible shield. (Captain America #332-#351, 1987-1989). In his new identity of "The Captain", Rogers initially used a pure adamantium shield provided by Stark, but a falling out between the two led Rogers to return it. He then began to use a pure vibranium shield provided by the Black Panther. When Rogers returned to his Captain America identity, Walker became the [[USAgent]] and returned the shield to him. Walker would go on to have his own array of different shields over the years, the first of which appeared to be the last vibranium shield Rogers was using as the Captain. The USAgent has used shields with an eagle motif and one in the shape of a star, as well as a photonic energy shield.

*At one point, when Rogers was exiled from the United States and was briefly unable to use his shield, [[Sharon Carter]] provided him with a photonic energy shield designed to mimic a vibranium matrix. This shield was also able to turn into an energy staff that could be used as a weapon, but the generator that created the shield was eventually destroyed in a confrontation with [[Ultron]].

*During the time when the shield was lost in the Atlantic, Rogers tried using a pure adamantium shield, but was unable to get used to the balance. He also tried fighting without a shield but also found it awkward. While up against [[HYDRA]] agents in the Smithsonian, he picked up the triangular shield that was being exhibited there and used it for a time before it was crushed by a [[Kree]] warrior. Sharon Carter next provided him with another photonic shield, but one whose shape could be controlled to morph the energy field into a wider force field, a [[bo staff]] or even fire a projection of the shield. While he enjoyed the versatility, Rogers noticed a number of drawbacks, particularly its inability to ricochet. Rogers gave one of the energy shield gloves to a freedom fighter in an oppressive future he traveled to and received a replacement from S.H.I.E.L.D. when he got back to his own time.

*In the time-jumping mini-series ''[[Avengers Forever]]'', various future and alternate versions of Captain America are shown with many different variations of the shield.

*[[Captain America#Ultimate Captain America|The Ultimate Universe version of Captain America]] uses a shield of pure adamantium, although that metal may not possess the same properties in the Ultimate universe as it does in the mainstream Marvel Universe. In the animated movie ''[[Ultimate Avengers]]'', based on ''[[Ultimates|The Ultimates]]'' but with several changes, Captain America uses an adamantium/vibranium shield.

*In The Ultimates storyline, during Ultimate Nightmare, Captain America encouters his Russian Super Soldier couterpart, who says that the shield of Captain America could not be replicated, so he made a replica, out of scrap metal with jagged claws lining the edge, yet it was far to weak to stand up the strength of Captain America's shield.
