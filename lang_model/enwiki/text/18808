"'''There's Something on Your Mind (Part 2)'''" is a 1960 [[novelty song]] by [[Bobby Marchan]].  The single was Marchan's most successful release on both the R&B and pop singles chart.  "There's Something on Your Mind" made it to number one on the R&B charts and number thirty-one on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|authorlink=Joel Whitburn|year=2004|publisher=Record Research|page=376}}</ref>.

The song was originally recorded as "There Is Something on Your Mind" in 1957 by [[Big Jay McNeely]] and his band in a small [[Seattle]] [[recording studio]], and leased more than a year later to [[Los Angeles]] [[disc jockey]] [[Hunter Hancock]]'s Swingin' Records [[record label|label]], where it reached #42 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s pop chart and number 2 on the R&B chart in early 1959. The lead vocalist on this original recording was [[Little Sonny Warner]]. Though McNeely is listed as the song's writer, he has freely admitted that he purchased the song from the [[Rivingtons]]' vocalist John "Sonny' Harris, who in turn had lifted much of it from a gospel song, "Something on My Mind," by The Highway QCs.

The song has been recorded many times since then by [[Big Jay McNeely]] himself with various collaborators, along with [[Freddy Fender]], [[B.B. King]], [[Albert King]], [[Etta James]], [[Gene Vincent]], the Jolly Jacks (who parodied the violence of the Marchan recording), and others.
