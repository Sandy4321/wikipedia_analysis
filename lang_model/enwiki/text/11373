==Casting==
From the beginning, Bell considered the role ideal for [[Suzanne Rogers]], a former [[Rockette]] for the [[Radio City Music Hall]]. Bell approached Rogers about taking the role of Maggie, and she agreed.<ref name="google3136">{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19760731&id=W2MzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aOoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3136,5119053| title= Suzanne Rogers Biogrophy| publisher= Google.com/News|accessdate=2010-06-07}}</ref> She was described by critics who gave reviews of the show as being one of the most energetic girls on [[Daytime]]. From her former [[Rockette]] life Rogers was known for her famous red hair, and freckles she was training to become a dancer. The news of [[Suzanne Rogers]] being cast as Maggie was a different move, taking an actress who loves to dance, and her character being a crippled farm girl. This was her first [[televison]] assignment, after being the youngest girl to take the stage at [[Radio City Music Hall]].<ref name="google3136"/> The part of Maggie on the [[Daytime]] [[serial]] provided an almost ideal alternative to her normal lifestyle. [[Suzanne Rogers]] played the part well wearing [[crutches]], originally [[producers]] wanted her to be in a wheelchair. They changed their decision knowing Rogers to be a former Rockette, and provided her with crutches. Getting around was not easy, however she pulled it off for her first year on screen as Maggie Horton. The character was originally supposed to be short lived. Popularity with on screen pairing with [[Mickey Horton]] proved to be a different story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.soapoperafan.com/2010/01/days-of-our-lives-spoilers-for-january-7-8/ |title=Days of Our Lives Spoilers For January 7-8. &#124; SoapOperaFan.com |publisher=Blog.soapoperafan.com |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}</ref> She later became an icon, and spokesperson for people with [[myasthenia gravis]].

===Departures===
In 1984, [[Suzanne Rogers]] (Maggie's portrayer) was diagnosed with a rare muscle disorder called [[myasthenia gravis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allergy-and-immune-system-disorders.info/Myasthenia-Gravis-Disease-50.cfm?lts=100304120331 |title=Myasthenia Gravis Disease &#124; Learn all About the Allergy and Immune System Disorders that Affect the Human Body &#124; Read Insightful Articles to Learn More About Common Diseases & Conditions |publisher=Allergy-and-immune-system-disorders.info |date= |accessdate=2010-06-12}}</ref> This disease caused extreme changes in Suzanne's face, affecting the muscles in her face.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2009/10/suzanne-rogers-interview-part-three.html |title=The Suzanne Rogers Interview, Part Three |publisher=Welovesoaps.net |date=2009-10-19 |accessdate=2010-06-12}}</ref> Rogers is forced to quit the show after 11 years when the effects of the disease became increasingly worse.<ref>{{cite web|author=Friday, October 16, 2009 Posted by Damon L.

Rogers returns to the serial when her health became better. Rogers wanting to educate viewers about the disease, confronted executive producer [[Ken Corday]] about her character being diagnosed with the disease. Corday agreed, and a storyline played out with Maggie learning she has myasthenia gravis. The actress went into remission in 1995, and has remained in remission since. In 2010, after her characters partner is killed off Maggie began to see some effects she saw well diagnosed with the disease in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvguide.ca/Soaps/Suds/Articles/100212_suds_report_NB.htm |title=The Suds Report - Feb12/10 &#124; Sympatico.ca TV Guide |publisher=Tvguide.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-06-12}}</ref>

===Mickey's Death===
{{Quote_box |width=48% |align=left|quote="I was stunned by the decision to kill Mickey. They didn<U+2019>t want to recast the role, so they needed to tie up that loose end. In the scripts, we kept talking about Mickey being out of town, or being in trial. He was always somewhere else. The audience that<U+2019>s watched us a while knew who Mickey was, but the new viewers didn<U+2019>t know who the devil we were talking about. It was hard, because John Clarke [the original Mickey] is still very much alive and well. I called him and said <U+201C>I hope I do you proud.<U+201D> There was one good thing about it<U+2014>we could use those great old Mickey-and-Maggie flashbacks, because in later years when they recast the role with John Ingle, and then Kevin Dobson, we couldn<U+2019>t go back and use any of my scenes with John. By removing the character from the page, we were able to go into the archives and pull out some really glorious stuff.
