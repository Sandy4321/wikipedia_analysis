'''Fairfield''' is a [[fell]] in the [[England|English]] [[Lake District]]. It is the highest of a group of hills in the Eastern Fells, standing to the south of the [[Helvellyn range]].

There is a marked contrast between the character of the northern and southern flanks of Fairfield. [[Alfred Wainwright]] in his influential ''[[Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells]]'' wrote that ''"From the south it appears as a great horseshoe of grassy slopes below a consistently high skyline...but lacking those dramatic qualities that appeal most to the lover of hills. But on the north side the Fairfield range is magnificent: here are dark precipices, long fans of scree,...desolate combes and deep valleys."''<ref name="wainwright">[[Alfred Wainwright]]:''[[A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells]]'', Book 1: ISBN 0-7112-2454-4</ref>

Fairfield has connecting ridges to several other fells and in plan view can be likened to a [[bow-tie]]. The top has an east-west axis with ridges running out north and south from each end. 

The two southern arms make up the popular walk, the [[Fairfield horseshoe]], which starts in [[Ambleside]] and makes a circuit of the valley of Rydale to the south. On the western side, descending from Fairfield are [[Great Rigg]], [[Heron Pike]] and [[Nab Scar]] while the eastern ridge bears the tops of [[Hart Crag]], [[Dove Crag]], [[High Pike (Scandale)|High Pike]] and [[Low Pike]].

The north western ridge of Fairfield crosses Deepdale Hause to [[St Sunday Crag]] whilst that to the north east is a short rocky spur into Deepdale, dropping over Greenhow End. A fifth line of high ground, less a ridge than a salient in the breast of the fell, runs due west to [[Seat Sandal]] across Grisedale Hause. 

The northern and eastern faces all loom above the desolate upper Deepdale, which is divided by Greenhow End. This short rocky spur has Hutaple Crag on the west and Scrubby Crag on the east. The [[corrie]]s of Cawk Cove and Link Cove lie on either side, each with a steep headwall formed by the flanks of Fairfield.

North west of Fairfield is Grisedale Tarn at around 1,770&nbsp;ft. This sizeable [[tarn (lake)|tarn]] has a depth of over 100&nbsp;ft and holds brown trout, perch and eels. It is also the legendary resting place of the crown of [[Dunmail]], following his- perhaps equally legendary- defeat in battle at [[Dunmail Raise]].<ref name="blair"> Blair, Don: ''Exploring Lakeland Tarns'': Lakeland Manor Press (2003): ISBN 0-9543-9041-5 </ref> The outflow is to Ullswater, 3&nbsp;miles to the north east along the strath of Grisedale. The south western flank of Fairfield looks down on Tongue Gill, a feeder of Raise Beck and Grasmere.

The summit is a rough stony plateau with the high point at the western end above the brink of Cawk Cove. The top is very flat and there are many [[cairn]]s, including a pair of large windbreaks near the high point. It is easy to get lost in mist and the cautious walker should beware of the presence of precipices to the north and west.<ref name="richards"> Richards, Mark: ''Near Eastern Fells'': Collins (2003): ISBN 0-0071-1366-8</ref> The vista is fine, with all of the major fell groups well seen and views down into the abyss of Deepdale only yards away.

Fairfield is most commonly climbed as the high point of the Fairfield horseshoe, a walk which has no agreed direction of travel. Coming from Great Rigg, the long grassy ridge heads directly for the summit, whilst the walker arriving from Hart Crag climbs up from Link Hause with a fine view of Scrubby Crag to the right, before the stony traverse of Fairfield summit.

Perhaps the finest indirect ascent is from [[Patterdale]] via [[Birks]] and St Sunday Crag, following the fine narrow ridge down to Deepdale Hause before ascending up rough ground to Cofa Pike. This subsidiary top of Fairfield has a fine peaked profile, quite outdoing its parent until the wide tabletop comes into view behind. A further rock [[tor]] is surmounted before the summit windbreaks are reached. From St Sunday Crag onwards the northern crags of Fairfied are seen in their full and wild glory.

Fairfield can be climbed via Grisedale Hause, either up Tongue Gill from [[Grasmere]], from Dunmail Raise or from Patterdale. The path up from the Hause is a rough zigzag up worsening scree. Grisedale Hause can also be reached as a ridge walk from Seat Sandal, or by cutting across the outlet of Grisedale Tarn from [[Dollywaggon Pike]] and the Helvellyns. In this way Fairfield forms part of the [[Threlkeld]] <U+2014> Kirkstone Walk, which continues over Fairfield summit to Dove Crag and [[Red Screes]].

A more challenging route climbs out of Dovedale, veering into the lower part of Link Cove before surmounting Greenhow End and The Step. Deepdale Hause can also be gained from this side, but climbs direct out of Link Cove or Cowk Cove are not practicable for walkers. <ref name="richards"/>
