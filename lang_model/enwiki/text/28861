'''William Allen Vivour''' (?? -??) was a native of [[Fernando Po]], [[Spanish Guinea]] who was the most successful 19th century planter owning a substantial amount of farmland on the island. He is part of a prominent [[Fernandinos#II._Fernandinos_.28Krios.29|Fernandino Krio]] family. 

By the 1880s Vivour employed a massive labor force of men from diverse ethnic origins recruited from the [[Bight of Biafra|Biafran]] and beyond. They were from [[Kingdom of Loango|Loango]]; the lower Guinea coast; [[Accra]]; and [[Grebo]] ''Kruboys'' (''migrant laborers'') from [[Cape Palmas]] and the [[Windward Coast]]. Vivour also recruited ethnic [[Bassa]] and ethnic [[Bubi]]. He also employed artisans from [[Accra]] who served as [[Cooper_(profession)|coopers]], [[Carpentry|carpenters]] and [[Metalsmith|smiths]]. <ref>Black scandal, America and the Liberian labor crisis, 1929-1936, p. 129.

In his honor, a forty foot high six hundred dollar monument imported from [[Liverpool, England]] was erected in a Protestant cemetery near the [[Fernandinos#II._Fernandinos_.28Krios.29|Krio]] settlement Clarence Cove on the island during the late 1800s.<ref>[Glimpses of Africa, West and Southwest coast.
