Due to the lack of any form of [[mass transit]] besides [[bus]] prior to 2008, the [[Phoenix Metropolitan Area]] has remained a very automobile-dependent city, with its first freeway opening in 1958<U+2014>a year preceding most cities' first freeway openings. Coupled with the explosive growth of the [[Valley of the Sun|region]] and adequate [[funding]], the result is one of the [[United States|nation's]] most expansive [[freeway]] networks, much of which is still largely incomplete.

The backbone of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]'s freeway system is composed of three major freeways&mdash;[[Interstate 10 in Arizona|Interstate 10]], [[Interstate 17]], and [[U.S. Route 60 in Arizona|U.S. Route 60]]. Interstate 10, being a transcontinental route between [[California]] and [[Florida]], is the most heavily traveled freeway in the [[Valley of the Sun]]. [[Interstate 17]] runs down the center of [[Arizona]], connecting [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] with [[Sedona, Arizona|Sedona]], [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] and the [[Grand Canyon]]. [[U.S. Route 60]] spans most of the country, but is only a [[controlled-access]] highway for a few short stints, one of them being in the Valley. It shuttles travelers to cities such as [[Wickenburg, Arizona|Wickenburg]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] (by way of a connection in Wickenburg with [[U.S. Route 93]]), and [[Globe, Arizona|Globe]]. In addition to these three freeways, two [[beltway]]s, Routes [[Arizona State Route 101|101]] and [[Arizona State Route 202|202]], loop around [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]] respectively. [[Arizona State Route 51|State Route 51]] connects [[Downtown Phoenix|Downtown]] with the northern reaches of the city, and [[Arizona State Route 143]] is a distributor for [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport]].

[[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] freeways are funded primarily by local [[sales tax]] dollars rather than federal money, so newer freeways were, and are, given [[List of Arizona State Routes|state route]] designation as opposed to [[Interstate Highway System|interstate]] designation.  Primarily due to this, Phoenix is the largest [[city]] in the [[United States]] to have two Interstate Highways and no [[List of auxiliary Interstate Highways|3-digit interstates]].<ref>{{cite web

It continues eastward through the cities of [[Goodyear, Arizona|Goodyear]], [[Avondale, Arizona|Avondale]], and [[Tolleson, Arizona|Tolleson]]; where it has an interchange with northbound [[Arizona State Route 101|Loop 101]]. Following Tolleson, [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|I-10]] reaches Phoenix's western city limits, and as it approaches [[Downtown Phoenix|downtown]], there is a four-level symmetrical [[stack interchange]] with [[Interstate 17 (Arizona)|Interstate 17]] known by locals as [[The Stack]]. The freeway proceeds eastward through a [[Papago Freeway Tunnel|tunnel]] constructed under a city park before it reaches the [[Mini Stack]] interchange with [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]] and [[Arizona State Route 51|SR 51]]. Turning southward at this interchange, [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|I-10]] runs adjacent to [[Sky Harbor International Airport]] before an interchange with the southern terminus of I-17. There are numerous construction projects along Interstate 10 spanning both east and westbound from around Dysart Road in Avondale, to Verrado Way in Buckeye. The projects are expected to convert the current 4 lane divided freeway into a 10 lane divided freeway. The final phase of the project is anticipated to be complete around late 2011. During construction drivers can expect weekly delays, closed stretches of roadway,  closed exits, and a slowed speed limit. When completed (along with the anticipation of the completion of state route 801) Traffic coming in and out of Phoenix is anticipated to be less congestive, and easier to manage.<ref>{{cite web

'''Maricopa Freeway'''<br>
After this second [[Black Canyon Freeway|I-17]] interchange, [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|I-10]] is known as the [[Maricopa Freeway]], presumably after the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe. It regains its primary eastward direction as it crosses the [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]], but after meeting [[Arizona State Route 143|SR 143]] it turns south again via what is dubbed by locals as the [[Interstate 10 in Arizona#Broadway Curve|Broadway Curve]].<ref>{{cite news

===Interstate 17===

'''Black Canyon Freeway'''<br>
[[Interstate 17|I-17]] enters the [[Valley of the Sun|valley]] from the north as the [[Black Canyon City, Arizona|Black Canyon]] Freeway, in the [[New River, AZ|New River]] and [[Anthem, AZ|Anthem]] area before a four-level interchange with [[Arizona State Route 101|Loop 101]]. It then continues directly southward on the 27th and 25th Avenue alignments in northern Phoenix, passing [[Metrocenter Mall (Phoenix, Arizona)|Metrocenter Mall]] as it heads directly for [[Downtown Phoenix|downtown]]. Another four-level stack awaits I-17 when it meets [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|Interstate 10]] immediately northwest of [[downtown Phoenix|downtown]] at [[The Stack]].

'''Maricopa Freeway'''<br>
At Durango Street, in the segment of freeway known as the Durango Curve, the highway turns eastward, becoming the Maricopa Freeway, and provides a southerly [[bypass (road)|bypass]] of downtown before meeting I-10 again near [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport|Sky Harbor]] and terminating. [[Interstate 17 (Arizona)|Interstate 17]] was the Valley's first [[freeway]], with maps showing a road built to [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highway]] standards route by 1961 in some segments.<ref>{{cite map

The [[Lori Piestewa|Piestewa]] Freeway begins at the [[Mini Stack]] interchange with [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|I-10]] and [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]], and proceeds north through [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] towards [[Piestewa Peak]] (formerly known as [[Squaw Peak]]). After passing near [[Paradise Valley, AZ|Paradise Valley]], Route 51 reaches its northern terminus at [[Arizona State Route 101|Loop 101]].

This [[freeway]] was formerly known as the [[Piestewa Peak|Squaw Peak]] Parkway, but since "[[Squaw]]" is regarded as a derogatory term for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] women, the Arizona Board of Geographic and Historic Names rechristened the route "Piestewa" Freeway after [[Lori Piestewa]], a Native American woman who died in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].  The name change was controversial, with most residents still referring to both the freeway and the landmark peak as Squaw Peak.<ref>{{cite news

(The Estrella Freeway was re-added to the system when Proposition 400 was passed ten years later in 2004.) Route 50 will not be re-added to the system, because in February 1996 the [[Arizona Department of Transportation|ADOT]] auctioned off all the [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] it had purchased for the [[freeway]], which was to be located between [[Arizona State Route 101|Loop 101]] and [[Arizona State Route 51|Route 51]] in the Central Valley.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.azcentral.com/flash/loop101/freeways.html |title= Valley Freeway System |work= Arizona Republic |accessdate= 2008-09-12 |format=Flash |first=Mark |last=Waters}}</ref>

'''Hassayampa Freeway'''

[[Interstate 11]] is a proposed Interstate Highway in the United States to run from Tonopah, Arizona northwest to Las Vegas, Nevada by way of Kingman, Arizona. The highway would parallel existing U.S. 93 north of Wickenburg, Arizona; south of Wickenburg, it would follow a new freeway near the Hassayampa River and is part of a long-range vision for the Valley's future transportation needs, as defined by the Maricopa Association of Governments and ADOT.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/phoenix/articles/2010/05/04/20100504phoenix-interstate-11-proposal.html |title=Phoenix Committee to Discuss Interstate 11 Proposal |work=Arizona Republic |author=Clancy, Michael |date=2010-05-04 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref> There is no identified funding for this facility and no formal studies have been initiated.

Construction of the proposed [[Arizona State Route 30|Route 30]] (former SR 801), would, if the freeway is approved, begin sometime in the early 2020s, based on funding and planning by the Maricopa Association of Governments.<ref>{{cite web

===Arizona State Route 85===
'''State Route 85'''

[[Arizona State Route 85|Route 85]] is an existing two-lane road, with one [[lane]] for northbound traffic and one lane for southbound traffic. This setup continues for the road's entire length, which is between [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|Interstate 10]] and [[Interstate 8 in Arizona|Interstate 8]]. However some sections are  being expanded to a four lane divided highway, because of [[traffic]] counts on Route 85 that are projecting to double by twenty years, a long range goal of transforming this [[rural]] two-lane highway into a full-fledged [[freeway]] was implemented. This will be done by twelve individual projects, each which will add two lanes of [[interim]] roadway aside the existing two-lane roadway with the goal of a [[freeway|freeway-style]] upgrade in mind.<ref>{{cite web

===Loop 202===
'''South Mountain Freeway'''

The [[Arizona State Route 202|South Mountain Freeway]] is a proposed southerly bypass of [[Downtown Phoenix]] which would do so by cutting through [[South Mountain Park]] and abutting the southern edge of the [[Ahwatukee]] neighborhood of Phoenix. It would begin at the already complete traffic [[stack interchange|interchange]] of the Santan Freeway and [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|Interstate 10]]. Heading west along the Pecos Road alignment through Ahwatukee, the freeway would straddle the border with the [[Gila River Indian Reservation]]. Turning northwest and eventually north, the [[South Mountains (Arizona)|South Mountain]] Freeway would follow the 55th Avenue alignment north to its terminus with Interstate 10 in west [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. This freeway has long considered to be the missing link by the region's planners because of the need to better move regional traffic, in addition to a better option for vehicles to avoid metro Phoenix. <ref>{{cite web

ADOT revealed in a press release in the [[Arizona Republic]] on March 9, 2009, that the fate of the South Mountain Freeway will not be decided until at least 2011 due to a need for the Maricopa Association of Governments to first balance a $5.3 billion budget shortfall in the region's 20-Year Transportation Plan.<ref>{{cite web

Until then, the proposed final segment of [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]] is under a Design Concept Report and Environmental Impact Statement analysis, which when completed around 2011 would allow the construction of this freeway to begin sometime between then and 2015, if at all. Community opposition, mainly from residents of Ahwatukee. While the Maricopa Association of Governments had considered building a limited access parkway or arterials along the South Mountain Freeway's proposed route, the eight-lane freeway concept ultimately was pushed by the region's planners to meet the traffic needs at close to the same cost. For most of 2010, the Gila River Indian Community, Maricopa Association of Governments, City of Phoenix, ADOT and others have been discussing movement of the alignment to tribal land, but no agreements have yet been reached.<ref>{{cite web

South of the proposed junction with Interstate 10, Loop 303 is currently under study to see if it is feasible to build an extension of the route to proposed [[Arizona State Route 30|Route 30]]. The final design concept report for the new [[freeway]] is due in late 2009/early 2010.<ref name="adot303"/>

==Funding==
[[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] has been expanding its highway system since 1985, when voters passed Proposition 300, which established a half-cent general [[sales tax]] to fund new urban [[freeway]]s that were currently in the Regional Transportation Plan. At the time, this included the unbuilt or partially unbuilt: [[Sky Harbor Expressway]], [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|I-10]], [[Arizona State Route 51|Route 51]], [[Arizona State Route 143|Route 143]], [[Arizona State Route 101|Loop 101]], and [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]]. Most of these were completed by 2005, with Loop 202 being in the final stage of [[construction]].<ref name="adot">{{cite web
  | url = http://www.azdot.gov/Highways/RFS/History.asp
  | title = Introduction to the Phoenix Urban Area Regional Freeway System
  | publisher =  Arizona Department of Transportation
  | accessdate = 2008-01-21}}</ref>

In 1994, voters in [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]] voted against Proposition 400, which would have extended the half-cent [[sales tax]] extension from 2006 through 2016 had it been passed. Half of this additional [[funding]] would have been used for improvements in [[mass transit]] as well as new freeways. But because of the defeat, there was no funding beyond fiscal year 2006, regardless of if the Regional Transportation Plan was completed or not.<ref name="adot"/>

In 1996, the [[Maricopa Association of Governments]] Regional Council passed a series of bills provided [[funding]] for a Long Range Plan between fiscal years 2007 and 2015. The [[Red Mountain Freeway]], [[Santan Freeway]], and [[Sky Harbor Expressway]] segments, all of which were previously unfunded, became prioritized with construction commencing almost immediately.<ref name="adot"/>

In 1999, even more [[funding]] was given to accelerate construction of the Regional Transportation Plan by the State Legislature, which passed a bill called the "2007 Acceleration Plan". This bill forced the State Infrastructure Bank to assist in funds, which assisted in pushing the completion of Regional Transportation Plan forward to the end of 2007.<ref name="adot"/>

With the transportation tax set to expire in 2006, a revived Proposition 400 was put before the voters of Maricopa County in 2004, ten years after the original vote ended in failure.  Proposing an identical half-cent extension of the sales tax, the new proposition would extend the tax a full twenty years as opposed to the original ten.<ref>{{cite web

  |format=PDF| title = 2005 Annual Report on the Status of the Implementation of Proposition 400
  | publisher = Maricopa Association of Governments
  | accessdate = 2008-08-27}}</ref>  Unlike its predecessor, the proposition passed by a wide 58-42% margin and established funding for several future projects including highways and mass transit.  A similar but much more wide-reaching proposal to enact a full one-cent sales tax increase over a thirty-year period on a statewide level, much of which would have gone to funding Phoenix area projects, failed to qualify for the 2008 general election ballot due to issues with the petition.<ref>{{cite news

  | work = Arizona Republic
  | accessdate = 2008-08-27}}</ref>

However, the 1985 plan was not fully completed by 2007 due to the lingering unfinished segment of [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]] between University Avenue and Power Road in [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], where work wrapped up on July 21, 2008.<ref name=freeway-opening/>

==Ramp metering==
The [[Phoenix metropolitan area|Phoenix]] freeway system heavily utilizes [[ramp meter]]s, with 121 currently operational in the [[Valley of the Sun|metropolitan area]]. Since their implementation in the 1980s, the goal of these has remained to "break up platoons" of cars by limiting the number that can enter a freeway at a time. The [[Arizona Department of Transportation]] (ADOT) states that this has been "tremendously successful".<ref>{{cite book

==Travel times program==
On January 22, 2008, a test program was begun by [[Arizona Department of Transportation|ADOT]] which involved the placement of travel times to popular commuter destinations on [[variable message signs]] along inbound [[freeway]] routes during the morning [[peak hours]] and outbound routes in the evening. These signs will only be activated on weekdays during peak travel hours (6am to 9am and 3pm to 7pm) and will not appear if there is a more urgent message to display; such as an [[Amber Alert]] or other emergency. If these signs gain motorist approval within their trial, then they might be expanded to include all [[Phoenix Metropolitan Area|Valley]] freeways and continued for years thereafter.<ref>{{cite web
