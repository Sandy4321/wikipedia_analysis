'''Balch Creek''' is a tributary, about {{convert|3.5|mi|km|1|}} long, of the [[Willamette River]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]].<ref name="streetmap">{{cite map |publisher = G.M.

At the lower end of the park, the stream enters a pipe and remains underground until reaching the river. Danford Balch, from whom the creek takes its name, settled a land claim along the creek in the mid-19th&nbsp;century. After murdering his son-in-law, he became the first person legally hanged in Oregon.<ref name= "Dibling"/>

From its source, the creek runs east on private property near Forest Park, a large municipal park in Portland, before turning briefly south at about [[river mile]] (RM)&nbsp;3 or river kilometer (RK)&nbsp;4.8. Soon thereafter, the stream receives an unnamed tributary on the right and turns southeast on private property along Northwest Cornell Road.

The Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) of the city of Portland monitored the flow of Balch Creek from June 1996 through September 2002 at a site, Node ABB857, where the stream leaves the surface and enters a storm sewer in Macleay Park. BES reported an average summer flow of {{convert|0.2|cuft/s|m3/s|}}, a maximum of {{convert|60|cuft/s|m3/s}}, and a minimum of 0. The average flow in winter was {{convert|1.9|cuft/s|m/s}}, with a maximum of {{convert|73|cuft/s|m3/s}} and a minimum of 0.<ref name="flow"/>

Measurements taken during an individual spring, from mid-May to mid-July 2002, showed the flow starting at about {{convert|2.5|cuft/s|m3/s}} and dwindling to 0 by early June. The flow through June depended partly on the weather; the highest flow, {{convert|4.5|cuft/s|m3/s}}, occurred after a rain. Measurements taken during an individual autumn, late August to late December 2001, were close to zero until November.

==Geology==
Solidified [[lava]] from Grande Ronde members of the [[Columbia River Basalt Group]] underlies the Balch Creek watershed. About 16&nbsp;million years ago during the [[Middle Miocene]], the Columbia River ran through a lowland south of its modern channel. Eruptions from linear vents in eastern Oregon and Washington flowed down this channel through what later became the [[Willamette Valley]].<ref name="Bishop"/> These flows, some of which reached the [[Pacific Ocean]], occurred between 16.5 and 15.6&nbsp;million years ago and covered almost {{convert|60000|mi2|km2}}.<ref name="Bishop"/> Geologists have identified several basalt flows in the West Hills, where they underlie the steepest slopes of Forest Park and form the columned rocks visible in parts of Balch Creek Canyon.<ref name="Bishop"> Bishop, pp.141&ndash;48</ref> Wind-deposited silts, unstable when wet, later covered most of the lava.

About 15,000&nbsp;years ago, cataclysmic [[ice age]] events known as the [[Missoula Floods]] or Bretz Floods originating in the [[Clark Fork (river)|Clark Fork]] region of northern [[Idaho]] inundated the Columbia River basin many times. These floods deposited huge amounts of debris and sediment and created new [[floodplain]]s in the Willamette Valley. From then until the 19th&nbsp;century, the lower Balch Creek watershed consisted of swampy marshlands and shallow semi-permanent lakes such as historic Guild's Lake. The final {{convert|1|mi|km|}} or so of historic Balch Creek flowed across this floodplain.<ref name="Capstone">{{cite web

==History==
===Names===
Multnomah County is named for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s who lived in the area before settlement by [[European American]]s in the 19th&nbsp;century. Members of the [[Multnomah (tribe)|Multnomah]] tribe of the [[Chinookan]] people lived on [[Sauvie Island]] in the Willamette River and on the mainland across from the island, downstream from the mouth of Balch Creek. However, since much of the area near the lower creek was swampy, it was not favored by the Multnomah. By the 1830s, diseases carried by white explorers and traders reduced the native population by up to 90&nbsp;percent in the lower Columbia basin.<ref name="planners">{{cite web

Macleay Park takes its name from Donald Macleay, a Portland merchant and real-estate developer who  acquired what had been the Balch property.

===Early water supply===
Balch Creek was one of Portland's sources of drinking water in the mid-19th&nbsp;century. Stephen Coffin and Finice Caruthers, two early Portland entrepreneurs, established the first public water supply for the city in 1857 by piping water from Caruthers Creek in southwest Portland through round fir logs with {{convert|2.5|in|cm|adj=on}} holes bored in them. In 1862, the Portland Water Company added water from Balch Creek to the system. The company's [[infrastructure]] included a timber dam on Balch Creek and a {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}} [[cast iron]] pipe, which continued to supply water to Portland until the 1880s. The [[Bull Run Watershed|Bull Run River]] in the [[Cascade Range]] east of the city began supplying most of Portland's drinking water in 1895.<ref name="water">{{cite web

===Industry===
[[Image:Portland Lakeyard.jpg|right|thumb|Two trains pass one another in the Lakeyard rail yard in the lower Balch Creek watershed. The yard, near river terminals and freight terminals, is part of the Guild's Lake Industrial Sanctuary.]]

One of the first industries in the Guild's Lake area was a sawmill built in the 1880s. Although large parts of the land remained undeveloped until the early 20th&nbsp;century, lumber mills, grain storage structures, railroads, and docks appeared along the waterfront. The Guild's Lake Rail Yard, built by the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] in the 1880s, became an important switching yard for trains.<ref name="planners"/> 

In 1905, the [[Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition]], held on an artificial island in Guild's Lake, helped spur growth in the area. After the exposition ended, developers filled the lake and its surrounds  with soil [[sluice]]d from parts of the Balch Creek watershed in the West Hills above the floodplain or [[dredging|dredge]]d from the Willamette River. Civic leaders promoted the Guild's Lake area as a good place for industry, and by the mid-1920s the lake was gone.<ref name="planners"/> The USGS places historic Guild's Lake at coordinates {{coord|45.5470620|-122.7206530}} at an elevation of {{convert|33|ft|m}} above sea level between what later became Northwest Saint Helens Road and Northwest Yeon Street, slightly west of Northwest 35th&nbsp;Avenue in Portland.<ref name = "GNIS Guild">{{cite web | work = Geographic Names Information System | publisher = U.S. Geological Survey | date = September 14, 1999 | url = http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:3:::NO::P3_FID:1851701 | title = Guild Lake (historical) | accessdaymonth = June 5, | accessyear = 2008}}</ref><ref>Modern location derived by using [[Google Earth]] and GNIS coordinates.</ref>

Between the 1890s and the 1930s, channel-deepening in the Willamette River improved the city's status as a deep-water seaport, as did completion in 1914 of a port terminal. Guild's Lake, close to highways as well as marine and rail terminals, became the most important industrial area in Portland. After [[World War II]], chemical and petroleum processing and storage, metals manufacturing, and other large industries expanded in the area. In 2001, the Portland City Council adopted the Guild's Lake Industrial Sanctuary Plan aimed at protecting the area's "long-term
economic viability as an industrial district."<ref name="planners"/>

Above the floodplain, much of the habitat in the watershed consists of mixed [[Pinophyta|conifer]] forest. Trees and shrubs, including stands of [[red alder]] and [[cottonwood]] trees, cover about 88&nbsp;percent of the middle reaches.<ref name="habitat"/> Near the headwaters, the forests  consist mainly of mixed conifers and hardwoods with a few older [[Douglas-fir]]s. Common species include [[Acer macrophyllum|big leaf maple]], [[willow]], [[Tsuga heterophylla|western hemlock]], red alder, [[Thuja plicata|western red cedar]], and Douglas-fir.<ref name="habitat"/> Most of this forest is relatively young. In Forest Park, [[Old growth forest|old growth]] forest, undisturbed for 250&nbsp;years or more, exists mainly in isolated patches.<ref>Houle, p. 22</ref>

===Fish and wildlife===
[[Image:Picoides-villosus-001.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The Hairy Woodpecker is one of many species of birds living in Forest Park.]] The historic creek likely supported diverse fish species, including salmon. After people filled the wetlands and diverted the lower stretch of the creek into a pipe, fish could no longer migrate to and from the Willamette River. The industrial parts of the watershed have no remaining aquatic habitat, but above the pipe the aquatic habitat remains relatively high, and Balch Creek and its tributaries support a resident population of cutthroat trout of up to about {{convert|7|in|cm}}.<ref name = "habitat">{{cite web

Nearby tracts of habitat strongly affect the wildlife in the Balch Creek watershed. This is especially true of Forest Park, which extends into other watersheds to the northwest. Birds and animals from these watersheds and from the [[Tualatin River]] valley, the [[Pacific Coast Ranges|Coast Range]], the Willamette River, Sauvie Island, the Columbia River, and the [[Vancouver, Washington]], lowlands, move in and out of the park with relative ease.<ref name = "wildlife">{{cite web

Pressure from habitat loss, pollution, hunting, and urban development has reduced or eliminated the large predators such as wolves, bears, and wild cats and has led to increased numbers of small predators such as [[weasel]]s and [[raccoon]]s. Roads through the watershed severely hamper the movement of large animals.  Invasive plant species such as English ivy have made the habitat simpler and less supportive of native insects and the salamanders and other amphibians that feed on them.<ref name="wildlife"/> Citizen groups such as the No Ivy League and Friends of Forest Park have engaged in projects to remove ivy, to plant native species, and to widen and protect riparian zones.<ref name="Knudsen"/>
