'''Glenn V. Cunningham''' (August 4, 1909 &ndash; March 10, 1988) was an [[United States|American]] [[distance runner]] and [[Athletics (sport)|athlete]] considered by many the greatest American miler of all time.  He received the [[James E. Sullivan Award]] as the top amateur athlete in the United States in 1933.  

Born in [[Elkhart, Kansas]], Cunningham was nicknamed the "Kansas Flyer", the "Elkhart Express" and the "Iron Horse of Kansas".
Cunningham's legs were very badly burned in a schoolhouse fire when he was eight and his brother Floyd was thirteen. Floyd died in the fire. When the doctors recommended amputating Glenn's legs, he was so distressed his parents would not allow it. The doctors predicted he might never walk normally again. He had lost all the flesh on his knees and shins and all the toes on his left foot. Also, his [[Transverse arch of the foot|transverse arch]] was practically destroyed. However, his great determination, coupled with hours upon hours of a new type of therapy, enabled him to gradually regain the ability to walk and to proceed to run. It was in the early summer of 1919 when he first tried to walk again, roughly two years after the accident. He had a positive attitude as well as a strong religious faith. His favorite Bible verse was Isaiah 40:31: "But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint."

Cunningham won the Sullivan medal in 1933 for his various running achievements in middle distance.

In the 1932 Olympics he took 4th place in the 1500 m, and in the 1936 Berlin Olympics, he took silver in the 1500 meters.

In 1934, he set the world record for the mile run at 4:06.8, which stood for three years.

In 1936, he set the world record in the 800 m run.

In 1938, he set a world record in the indoor mile run of 4:04.4.  He retired from competition in 1940. ([[Roger Bannister]] was the first to break the four minute mile, in 1954.)

Cunningham's goal-unachieved was a four minute mile. Many people tried that before and failed. Several theorists proclaimed it was impossible physiologically for humans.  Runners tried running steady and fast-paced the whole time. Others tried to go steady for the first half then give it all they had.  Cunningham tried many different ways.  His greatest success was a strategy, developed from childhood, of running his fastest right from the beginning and then throughout every race.  

Cunningham has a park named after him in his hometown of Elkhart, Kansas.
