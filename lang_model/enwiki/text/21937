[[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] '''Leslie Richard Groves, Jr''' (17 August 1896&ndash;13 July 1970) was a [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] who oversaw the construction of [[the Pentagon]] and was in charge of the [[Manhattan Project]] that developed the [[atomic bomb]] during [[World War II]].

The son of a [[United States Army]] [[chaplain]], Groves was raised as a [[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|military brat]], living at a number of Army posts. He graduated fourth in his class at the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point in 1918 and was commissioned into the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]]. In 1929, he went to [[Nicaragua]] as part of an expedition whose purpose was to conduct a survey for the [[Inter-Oceanic Nicaragua Canal]]. Following the [[1931 Nicaragua earthquake]], Groves took over responsibility for [[Managua]]'s water supply system, for which he was awarded the Nicaraguan Presidential Medal of Merit. He attended the [[Command and General Staff School]] at [[Fort Leavenworth]], [[Kansas]] in 1935 and 1936, and the [[Army War College]] in 1938 and 1939, after which he was posted to the [[War Department]] [[General Staff]].

In 1940 Groves, who "had a reputation as a doer, a driver, and a stickler for duty", became special assistant for construction to the [[Quartermaster General (United States)|Quartermaster General]], tasked with inspecting construction sites and checking on their progress. The construction program was dogged by bottlenecks, shortages, delays, spiralling costs, and poor living conditions at the construction sites. In August 1941, he was charged with responsibility for a gigantic office complex to house the [[United States Department of War|War Department's]] 40,000 staff, which would ultimately become [[The Pentagon]].

In September 1942, Groves took charge of the [[Manhattan Project]]. He was involved most aspects of the bomb's development. He was involved in the selctions of the sites for theoretical research and materials production at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]], and [[Hanford Site|Hanford, Washington]]. He directed another enormous construction effort. He made critical decisions on prioritizing the various methods of isotope separation, acquiring raw materials needed by the scientists and engineers, and in working with the Army Air Force bomber unit which would deliver the finished bombs to their targets. He was involved in collecting military intelligence on German atomic research and helped select which cities in [[Japan]] were chosen as targets. Groves wrapped the Manhattan Project in security which, however, failed to prevent the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet]]s from conducting a successful espionage program that stole some of its most important secrets.

After the war, Groves remained in charge of the Manhattan Project until responsibility for nuclear weapons production was handed over to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] in 1947. He then headed the [[Armed Forces Special Weapons Project]], which had been created to control the military aspects of nuclear weapons. Groves realized that in the rapidly shrinking postwar Army he would not be given any assignment approaching in importance the one he had held in the Manhattan Project, and he decided to leave the Army in 1948. He was promoted to [[Lieutenant General (United States)|lieutenant general]] just before his retirement on 29 February 1948 in recognition of his leadership of the bomb program. By a special Act of Congress his date of rank was backdated to 16 July 1945, the date of the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]]. Groves went on to become a Vice-President at [[Sperry Rand]].

==Early life==
Leslie Richard (Dick) Groves, Jr was born in [[Albany, New York]] on 17 August 1896,<ref name="Ancell&Miller">{{harvnb|Ancell|Miller|1996|pp=124-125}}</ref> the third son of four children of a [[pastor]], Leslie Richard Groves, Sr, and his wife Gwen  n<U+00E9>e Griffith. A descendent of French [[Huguenot]]s who came to America in the 17th century, Leslie Richard Groves, Sr resigned as pastor of the Sixth [[Presbyterian]] church  in Albany in December 1896 to become a [[United States Army]] [[chaplain]]. He was posted to the [[14th Infantry Regiment (United States)|14th Infantry]] at [[Vancouver Barracks]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] in 1897.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|2002|pp=25-28}}</ref> Following the outbreak of the [[Spanish<U+2013>American War]] in 1898 Chaplain Groves was sent to [[Cuba]] with the [[8th Infantry Regiment (United States)|8th Infantry]]. On returning to the Vancouver Barracks, he was ordered to rejoin the 14th Infantry in the [[Philippines]]. Service in the [[Philippine<U+2013>American War]] and the [[Boxer Rebellion]] followed.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|2002|pp=34-37}}</ref> The 14th Infantry returned to the United States in 1901 and moved to [[Fort Snelling]], [[Minnesota]]. The family relocated to there from Vancouver, but moved to [[Fort Hancock, New Jersey|Fort Hancock]], [[New Jersey]] the next year. They returned to Vancouver in 1905. Chaplin Groves was hospitalized with [[tuberculosis]] at [[Fort Bayard Historic District|Fort Bayard]] in 1905. He decided to settle in sourthern [[California]] and bought a house in [[Altadena, California]]. His next posting was to [[ Fort Apache Indian Reservation| Fort Apache]], [[Arizona]], so the family spent summers there and returned to Altadena where the children attended school.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|2002|pp=43-47}}</ref>

In 1911, Chaplain Groves was ordered to return to the 14th Infantry, which was now stationed at [[Fort William Henry Harrison]], [[Montana]]. Here young Dick Groves met Grace (Boo) Wilson, the daughter of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Richard Hulbert Wilson, a career Army officer who had served with Chaplain Groves with the 8th Infantry in Cuba. In 1913, the 14th Infantry moved once move, this time to [[Fort Lawton]], Washington.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|2002|pp=51-54}}</ref> Dick Groves therefore entered [[Queen Anne High School (Seattle, Washington)|Queen Anne High School]] in 1913. In September of that year, he commenced his final year of high school, and also enrolled at the [[University of Washington]]. He attempted to secure an appointment to the  [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point in 1914 but did not succeed. Instead, he enrolled at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. In 1916, Groves sat the examinations for admission to West Point and this time he was accepted.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|2002|pp=61-69}}</ref>

Groves' class entered West Point on 15 June 1916, but the [[United States declaration of war upon Germany (1917)|United States declaration of war upon Germany]] in April 1917 caused the course to be shortened to what was known as the War Emergency Course, and they were graduated early on 1 November 1918. Groves graduated fourth in his class, and was commissioned into the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] as a [[second lieutenant]],<ref name="Callum 1930">{{harvnb|Callum|1930|pp=1337-1338}}</ref> as was usual for the highest ranking cadets in a class.<ref name="Norris, pp. 87-90"/>

==Between the wars==
After the traditional month's leave, he reported to  [[Camp A. A. Humphreys]], [[Virginia]] in December 1918, where he was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] on 1 May 1919.<ref name="Callum 1930"/> He was sent to France in June on an educational tour of the European battlefields of [[World War I]].<ref name="Norris, pp. 87-90">{{harvnb|Norris|2002|pp=87-90}}</ref> After returning from Europe, Groves became a student officer at the Engineer School at Camp Humphreys in September 1919.<ref name="Callum 1930"/> On graduation he was posted to the 7th Engineers at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as a [[Company (military unit)|company]] commander.<ref name="Callum 1930"/> He returned to Camp Hunphreys in February 1921 for the  Engineer Basic Officers' Course.<ref name="Norris, pp. 96-98">{{harvnb|Norris|2002|pp=96-98}}</ref> On graduation in August 1921, he was posted to the 4th Engineers, stationed at [[Fort Lewis|Camp Lewis]], Washington. He was then posted to Fort Worden, Washington in command of a survey detachment.<ref name="Callum 1930"/> This was located close to [[Seattle]] and he was able to pursue his courtship of Grace Wilson, who had become a [[kindergarten]] teacher. They were married in St Clement's Episcopal Church in Seattle on 10 February 1922.<ref name="Norris, pp. 96-98"/> Their marriage produced two children: a son, Richard Hulbert, born in 1923, and a daughter, Gwen, born in 1928.<ref name="Norris, pp. 100-105">{{harvnb|Norris|2002|pp=100-105}}</ref>

In November 1922, Groves received his first overseas posting, as a company commander with the 3rd Engineers at the [[Schofield Barracks]] in [[Hawaii]].<ref name="Callum 1930"/> He received a commendation for his work there, constructing a trail from [[Kahuku]] to [[Pupukea]].In November 1925 he was posted to [[Galveston, Texas]], as an assistant to the District Engineer, [[Major]] [[Julian Schley]]. Grove's duties involved opening the channel at [[Port Isabel, Texas]] and supervising dredging operations in [[Galveston Bay]]. In 1927 he was became commander of Company D, 1st Engineers at [[Fort DuPont]], [[Delaware]]. During the [[Floods in the United States: 1901<U+2013>2000|New England Flood of November 1927]] he was sent to [[Fort Ethan Allen]], [[Vermont]] to assist with a detachment of the 1st Engineers. After a  [[pontoon bridge]] they constructed was swamped and swept away by the flood waters, Groves was accused of negligence. A month later Groves and several of his men were seriously injured, one  fatally, when a block of [[Trinitrotoluene]] (TNT) prematurely detonated. Groves' superior wrote a critical report on him, but the [[Chief of Engineers]], [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Edgar Jadwin]], interceded, attributing blame to Groves' superiors instead. Groves was returned to Fort DuPont.<ref name="Norris, pp. 100-105"/>

In 1929, Groves departed for [[Nicaragua]] in charge of a company of the 1st Engineer as part of an expedition whose purpose was to conduct a survey for the [[Inter-Oceanic Nicaragua Canal]]. Following the [[1931 Nicaragua earthquake]], Groves took over responsibility for [[Managua]]'s water supply system, for which he was awarded the Nicaraguan Presidential Medal of Merit. Groves was finally promoted to [[Captain (United States)|captain]] on 20 October 1934. He attended the [[Command and General Staff School]] at [[Fort Leavenworth]], [[Kansas]] in 1935 and 1936, after which he was posted to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], as assistant to the commander of the [[Mississippi Valley Division|Missouri River Division]]. In 1938 and 1939 he attended the [[Army War College]]. Then, on 1 July 1939, he was posted to the [[War Department]] [[General Staff]] in Washington, D.C.<ref name="Callum 1940">{{harvnb|Callum|1940|p=382}}</ref>

==World War II==
===Construction Division===
[[File:Pentagon construction.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Northwest exposure of the Pentagon's construction under way, 1 July 1942]]
Groves was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] on 1 July 1940. Three weeks later, he became special assistant for construction to the [[Quartermaster General (United States)|Quartermaster General]], [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Edmund B. Gregory]].<ref name="Callum 1950">{{harvnb|Callum|1950|p=371}}</ref> The two men had known each other a long time, as Grove's father was a close friend of Gregory's. At this point, the U.S. Army was about to embark on a national mobilization, and it was the task of the Construction Division of the [[Quartermaster Corps]] to prepare the necessary accommodation and training facilities for the vast army that would be created. Groves, who "had a reputation as a doer, a driver, and a stickler for duty", was tasked with inspecting construction sites and checking on their progress.<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|pp=158-159}}</ref> The enormous construction program was dogged by bottlenecks, shortages, delays, spiralling costs, and poor living conditions at the construction sites. Newspapers began publishing accounts charging the Construction Division with incompetence, ineptitude, and inefficiency. On 12 November 1940, Gregory informed Groves that he would taking over command of the Fixed Fee Branch of the Construction Division as soon as his promotion to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] came through. Groves assumed his new rank and duties on 14 November 1940.<ref name="Fine, pp. 241-243">{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|pp=241-243}}</ref> Grove later recalled that:{{quote|During the first week that I was on duty there, I could not walk out of my office down the corridor to Hartman's office without being literally assailed by the officers or civilian engineers with liaison responsibility for various camps. It is no exaggeration to state that during this period decisions involving up to $5,000,000 were made at the rate of about one every 100 feet of corridor walked.<ref name="Fine, pp. 241-243"/>}}

|quote=First, General Groves is the biggest S.O.B. I have ever worked for.  He is most demanding.  He is most critical.  He is always a driver, never a praiser.  He is abrasive and sarcastic. He disregards all normal organizational channels.  He is extremely intelligent.  He has the guts to make difficult, timely decisions.  He is the most egotistical man I know.  He knows he is right and so sticks by his decision.  He abounds with energy and expects everyone to work as hard or even harder than he does. Although he gave me great responsibility and adequate authority to carry out his mission-type orders, he constantly meddled with my subordinates. However, to compensate for that he had a small staff, which meant that we were not subject to the usual staff-type heckling. He ruthlessly protected the overall project from other government agency interference, which made my task easier. He seldom accepted other agency cooperation and then only on his own terms. During the war and since I have had the opportunity to meet many of our most outstanding leaders in the Army, Navy and Air Force as well as many of our outstanding scientific, engineering and industrial leaders. And in summary, if I had to do my part of the atomic bomb project over again and had the privilege of picking my boss I would pick General Groves.

Groves instituted a series of reforms. He installed phone lines for the Supervising Construction Quartermasters; demanded weekly reports on progress, ordered that reimbursement vouchers be processed within a week, and sent expediters to sites reporting shortages. He ordered his contractors to hire whatever special equipment they needed and to pay premium prices if it guaranteed quick delivery. Instead of allowing construction of camps to proceed in whatever order the contractors saw fit, Groves laid down priorities for completion of camp facilities, so that the troops could begin moving in even while construction was still under way. By mid-December, the worst of the crisis was over. Over half a million men had been mobilized and essential accommodation and facilities for two million men was 95% complete.<ref name="Fine, pp. 241-243"/> Between 1 July 1940 and 10 December 1941, the Construction Division negotiated 512 lump sum contracts worth $88,170,000 and let a further 1,671 advertized lump contracts worth $240,132,000; but it negotiated [[cost-plus contract|fixed fee contracts]] with 154 construction firms and 149 architect-engineers $1,347,991,000, about 80% of the total.<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|pp=430-431}}</ref>

On 19 August 1941, Groves was summoned to a meeting with the head of the Construction Division, [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Brehon B. Somervell]]. In attendance were Captain Clarence Renshaw, one of Groves' assistants, Major [[Hugh J. Casey]], the chief of the Construction Division's Design and Engineering Section, and [[George Bergstrom]], a former president of the [[American Institute of Architects]]. Casey and Bergstrom had designed an enormous office complex to house the [[United States Department of War|War Department's]] 40,000 staff together in one building, a five-story, five-sided structure, which would ultimately become [[The Pentagon]]. The Pentagon had a floor area of {{convert|5100000|sqft|sqm}}&mdash;twice that of the [[Empire State Building]] &mdash; making it the largest office building in the world. The estimated cost was $35 million, and Somervell wanted {{convert|500000|sqft|sqm}} of floor space available by 1 March 1942. Bergstrom would be architect-engineer with Renshaw in charge of construction, reporting directly to Groves.<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|pp=431-439}}</ref> At its peak the project employed 13,000 persons. By the end of April, the first occupants were moving in and {{convert|1000000|sqft|sqm}} of space was ready by the end of May.<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|pp=511-512}}</ref>  In the end, the project cost some $63 million.<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|pp=608-609}}</ref>

Groves steadily overcame one crisis after another, dealing with strikes, shortages, competing priorities and engineers who were not up to their tasks. He worked six days a week in his office in Washington, D.C. During the week he would determine which project most needed personal attention and pay it visit on Sunday. Groves later recalled that he was "hoping to get to a war theater so I could find a little peace."<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|p=513}}</ref>

===Manhattan Project===
{{main|Manhattan Project}}
[[File:United States Department of State headquarters.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Groves ran the Manhattan Project from the fifth floor of the New War Department Building.]]
The [[Manhattan Engineer District]] (MED) was formally established by the Chief of Engineers, Major General [[Eugene Reybold]] on 16 August 1942. The name was chosen by Groves and its commander, Colonel James C. Marshall. Like other engineer districts, it was named after the city where its headquarters was located, at [[Tower 270|270 Broadway]]. Unlike the others, however, it had no geographic boundaries. Moreover, Marshall had the authority of a division engineer head and reported directly to Reybold. Although Reybold was satisfied with the progress being made, Dr [[Vannevar Bush]] was less so.  He felt that aggressive leadership was required, and suggested the appointment of a prestigious officer as overall project director. Somervell, now Chief of [[Army Service Forces]], recommended Groves.<ref name="Fine&Remington, pp. 659-661">{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|pp=659-661}}</ref> Somervell met Groves outside the hearing room where Groves had been testifying before a [[United States Congress]] committee on military housing and informed him that "[[Henry L. Stimson|The Secretary of War]] has selected you for a very important assignment, and the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President]] has approved the selection... If you do the job right, it will win the war." Groves could not hide his disappointment: "Oh, that thing," he replied.<ref name="Groves, pp. 3-4">{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=3-4}}</ref>

[[Image:Groves Oppenheimer.jpg|thumbnail|left|240px|Groves (left) and [[Robert Oppenheimer]] (right)]]
Groves met with Major General [[Wilhelm D. Styer]] in his office at the Pentagon to discuss the details. They agreed that in order to avoid suspicion, Groves would continue to supervise the Pentagon project. He would be promoted to [[Brigadier General (United States)|brigadier general]], as it was felt that the title "general" would hold more sway with the academic scientists working on the Manhattan Project.<ref name="Groves, pp. 4-5">{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=4-5}}</ref> Groves therefore waited until his promotion came through on 23 September 1942 before assuming his new command. Groves orders placed him directly under Somervell rather than Reybold, with Marshall now answerable to Groves.<ref name="Fine&Remington, pp. 659-661"/> Groves soon decided to establish his project headquarters on the fifth floor of the [[Harry S. Truman Building|New War Department Building]] in Washington, D.C., where Marshall had maintained a liaison office.<ref>{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=27-28}}</ref> In August 1943, the Manhattan Engineer District headquarters moved to [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], but the name of the district did not change.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=88}}</ref>

Construction accounted for roughly 90% of the Manhattan Project's total cost.<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|p=663}}</ref> The day after he took over, Groves and Marshall took a train to [[Tennessee]] to inspect the site that Marshal had chosen for the proposed production plant at Oak Ridge. Groves was suitably impressed with the site,<ref>{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=25-26}}</ref> and steps were taken to condemn the land. Protests, legal appeals, and congressional inquiries were to no avail. By mid-November [[US Marshal]]s were tacking notices to vacate on farmhouse doors, and construction contractors were moving in.<ref name="Fine&Remington, pp. 663-664">{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|pp=663-664}}</ref> Meanwhile, Groves had met with [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]] [[physicist]] and discussed the creation of a laboratory where the bomb could be designed and tested. Groves was impressed with Oppenheimer's grasp of what would be required and became convinced the Oppenheimer was the right and the only man to run the laboratory, although no one agreed with him in 1942 when Oppenheimer had no administrative experience and, unlike other potential candidates, no [[Nobel Prize]]. Oppenheimer's brilliant, charismatic leadership was decisive in creating workable designs and getting them transformed into usable bombs. Asked years later why the Groves chose him, Oppenheimer replied that Groves "had a fatal weakness for good men."<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|2002|p=242}}</ref> In October 1942 the two men inspected sites in [[New Mexico]] where they selected at suitable site for the laboratory at [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]]. Unlike Oak Ridge, the owners were eager to sell, and the ranch school at Los Alamos, along with {{convert|54000|acres|ha}} of surrounding forest and grazing land was quickly acquired.<ref name="Fine&Remington, pp. 663-664">{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|pp=664-665}}</ref>

[[Image:K-25 Aerial.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Oak Ridge K-25 Plant]]
Groves made critical decisions on prioritizing the various methods of isotope separation, acquiring raw materials needed by the scientists and engineers. By the time Groves assumed command of the project, it was evident that the AA-3 priority rating that Marshall had obtained would not be sufficient. Groves went to [[Donald M. Nelson]], the chairman of the [[War Production Board]] and, after threatening to take the matter to the President, obtained a AAA priority for the Manhattan project. It was agreed that the AA-3 priority would still be used where possible.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=80-82}}</ref> The Combined Development Trust was established in June 1944, with Groves as its chairman, to procure [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] ores on international markets. In 1944, the trust purchased {{convert|3440000|lb|kg}} of uranium oxide ore from companies operating mines in the [[Belgian Congo]]. In order to avoid briefing [[U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]] on the project, a special account not subject to the usual auditing and controls was used to hold Trust monies. Between 1944 and when he resigned from the Trust in 1947, Groves deposited a total of $37.5 million the Trust's account.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=90, 299-306}}</ref>

[[Image:Groves and Farrel.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Groves (left) and Brigadier General [[Thomas Farrell (general)|Thomas F. Farrell]] (right), 1945]]
In 1943, the MED became responsible for collecting [[military intelligence]] on Axis atomic research. Groves created  [[Operation Alsos]], special intelligence teams that would follow in the wake of the advancing armies, rounding up enemy scientists and collecting what technical information and technology they could. Alsos teams ultimately operated in Italy, France and Germany.<ref>{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=189-194}}</ref> The security system for the Manhattan District resembled that of other engineer districts. The Manhattan District organised its own Counter Intelligence which gradually grew in size and scope. Oppenheimer's [[Communist Party]] connections soon came to light, but Groves personally ordered him cleared. Strict security measures failed to prevent the Soviets from conducting a successful espionage program that stole some of its most important secrets.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=254-266}}</ref>

Groves met with the Chief of [[United States Army Air Forces]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Henry H. Arnold]], in March 1944 to discuss the delivery of the finished bombs to their targets. Groves was hoping that the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] would be able to carry the finished bombs. The 509th Composite Group was duly activated on 17 December 1944 at [[Wendover Army Air Field]], [[Utah]], under the command of by Colonel [[Paul W. Tibbets]].<ref>{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=253-259}}</ref> A joint Manhattan District-USAAF targeting committee was established to determine which cities in Japan should be targets, which recommended [[Kokura]], [[Hiroshima]], [[Niigata]] and [[Kyoto]]. At this point, [[Secretary of War]] [[Henry L. Stimson]] intervened, announcing that he would be making the targetting decision, and that he would not authorize the bombing of Kyoto. Groves attempted to get him to change his mind several times and Stimson refused every time. In the end, Groves asked Arnold to remove Kyoto not just from the list of nuclear targets, but from targets for conventional bombing as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=268-276}}</ref> One of Kyoto's substitutes as a target became [[Nagasaki]].<ref>{{harvnb|Groves|1962|p=308}}</ref>

[[Image:Trinity Ground Zero.jpg|thumbnail|right|240px|Groves and others at remains of the [[Trinity test]]]]
Groves was promoted to temporary [[Major General (United States)|major general]] in March 1944.<ref name="Callum 1950"/> After the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] made the project public knowledge, Groves was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (United States)|Distinguished Service Medal]]. His citation read:{{quote|Major General Leslie Richard Groves, as Commanding General, Manhattan Engineer District, Army Service Forces, from June 1942 to August 1945 coordinated, administered and controlled a project of unprecedented, world-wide significance - the development of the Atomic Bomb. His was the responsibility for procuring materiel and personnel, marshalling the forces of government and industry, erecting huge plants, blending the scientific efforts of the United States and foreign countries, and maintaining completely secret the search for a key to release atomic energy. He accomplished his task with such outstanding success that in an amazingly short time the Manhattan Engineer District solved this problem of staggering complexity, defeating the Axis powers in the race to produce an instrument whose peacetime potentialities are no less marvelous than its wartime application is awesome. The achievement of General Groves is of unfathomable importance to the future of the nation and the world.<ref name="Norris, p. 443"/>}}
Groves had been previously nominated for the Distinguished Service Medal for his work on the Pentagon, but to avoid drawing attention to the Manhattan Project, it had not been awarded at the time. After the war, the Decorations Board decided to change it to a [[Legion of Merit]].<ref name="Norris, p. 443">{{harvnb|Norris|2002|p=443}}</ref> In recognition of his work on the project, the Belgian government made him a Commander of the [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Order of the Crown]] and the British government made him an honorary [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]].<ref name="Callum 1950"/>

==Post-War==
[[Image:Sandia-Building800-1951.gif|right|240px|thumb|Sandia Base, New Mexico in 1951]]
Groves ran roughshod over many people and made many enemies, some of them quite powerful. These enemies eventually succeeded in drastically reducing Groves' power and authority as control over [[nuclear power]] was transferred from the Manhattan District to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] on 1 January 1947.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=596-601}}</ref> On 29 January 1947, Secretary of War [[Robert P. Patterson]] and [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[James V. Forrestal]] issued a joint directive creating the [[Armed Forces Special Weapons Project]] (AFSWP) to control the military aspects of nuclear weapons. Groves was appointed its chief on 28 February 1947. In April, AFSWP moved from the New War Department Building to the fifth floor of the Pentagon. Groves had already made a start on the new mission by creating [[Sandia Base]] in 1946.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|2002|pp=490-491}}</ref>

Groves realized that in the rapidly shrinking postwar Army he would not be given any assignment approaching in importance the one he had held in the Manhattan Project, as such posts would go to combat commanders returning from overseas, and he decided to leave the Army.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|2002|pp=502-504}}</ref> He was promoted to [[Lieutenant General (United States)|lieutenant general]] just before his retirement on 29 February 1948 in recognition of his leadership of the bomb program. By special Act of Congress his date of rank was backdated to 16 July 1945, the date of the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]].<ref name="Callum 1950"/>

Groves went on to become a Vice-President at [[Sperry Rand]], an equipment and electronics firm. He moved to [[Darien, Connecticut]] in 1948.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|2002|p=505}}</ref> He retired from Sperry Rand in 1961.<ref name="Norris, pp. 517-519"/> He also served as president of the [[West Point]] alumni organization, the ''Association of Graduates''. He presented [[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] the [[Sylvanus Thayer Award]] in 1962, which was the occasion of MacArthur's famous [[Wikisource:Duty, honor, country|''Duty, Honor, Country'']] speech to the [[United States Military Academy]] Corps of Cadets in 1962. In retirement, Groves' wrote an account of the Manhattan Project entitled ''Now It Can Be Told'', which was originally published in 1962.<ref name="Norris, pp. 517-519">{{harvnb|Norris|2002|pp=517-519}}</ref> In 1964, he moved back to Washington, D.C.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|2002|p=533}}</ref>

Groves suffered a heart attack caused by chronic [[calcification]] of the [[aortic valve]] on 13 July 1970. He was rushed to [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]], where he died that night. A funeral service was held in the chapel at [[Fort Myer, Virginia]], after which Groves was interred in [[Arlington National Cemetery]] next to his brother Allen, who had died in 1916.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|2002|pp=69, 537-539}}</ref> Groves is memorialized as the namesake of Leslie Groves Park along the [[Columbia River]], not more than five miles from the [[Hanford Site]] in [[Richland, Washington|Richland]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.hanford.gov/page.cfm/Famous/Groves|accessdate=4 October 2010|title=Leslie Groves - Hanford Site|publisher=[[Department of Energy]]}}</ref>
