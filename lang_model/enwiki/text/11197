She later received a place at the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]] in London on a drama teachers' course in 1977,<ref name="farewell"/> where she met her future comedy partner, [[Dawn French]].<ref>William Langley.

They had grown up on the same base, even having had the same best friend, without ever meeting.<ref name="looking"/> The comic duo originally did not get on well at first, and as far as Saunders was concerned, French was a "cocky little upstart". The distrust was mutual; French considered Saunders snooty and uptight.<ref name="looking"/> French actually wanted to become a drama teacher,<ref name="screenonline"/> whereas Saunders loathed the idea and had not  fully understood what the course was about; thus, she disliked French for being enthusiastic and confident about the course.<ref name="farewell"/> Saunders was shocked to find that she was actually taking courses to become a teacher, as her mother had filled out the application form.<ref name="farewell"/> Her mother however, was saddened when Saunders chose not to apply for an [[Oxbridge]] university education.<ref name="farewell"/> 

After the initial friction, whilst at college, Saunders and French shared a flat together. French has remarked on Saunders' messy habits when sharing the house, stating "When we lived together in [[Chalk Farm]] she had a room at the top of the house. We got broken into and the police said, 'Well, it is quite bad, but the worst is that room at the top.' And, of course, nobody had been in there."<ref name="farewell"/> The two later performed together after graduation, working the festival, cabaret,<ref name="farewell"/> and stand-up circuits. They formed a double-act called The Menopause Sisters. Saunders described the act, which involved wearing [[tampons]] in their ears, as "cringeworthy".<ref name="looking"/> The manager of the club where they performed recalled that, "They didn't seem to give a damn. There was no star quality about them at all."<ref name="looking"/>
