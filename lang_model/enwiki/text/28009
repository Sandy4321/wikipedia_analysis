Funded by the Russian space agency [[Roscosmos]] and developed by [[NPO Lavochkin]] and the [[Russian Space Research Institute]], Fobos-Grunt was the first Russian-led interplanetary mission since the failed [[Mars 96]]. The last ''successful'' interplanetary missions were the Soviet [[Vega 2]] in 1985<U+2013>1986, and the partially successful [[Fobos 2]] in 1988<U+2013>1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.rss.html?pid=39079|title=Jonathan's Space Report No. 650 2011 Nov 16}}</ref> Fobos-Grunt was designed to become the first spacecraft to return a macroscopic sample from an extraterrestrial body since [[Luna 24]] in 1976.<ref name="universetoday_daring">{{cite news|url=http://www.universetoday.com/89845/daring-russian-sample-return-mission-to-martian-moon-phobos-aims-for-november-liftoff/|title=Daring Russian Sample Return mission to Martian Moon Phobos aims for November Liftoff|publisher=Universe Today|date=13 October 2011}}</ref> ([[Hayabusa]] returned microscopic grains of asteroid material in 2010, and [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]] returned cometary dust in 2006.<ref name="route">{{cite news|title=NASA Spacecraft Returns With Comet Samples After 2.9 Bln Miles|publisher=Bloomberg|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&sid=argumCeZP_Zc&refer=us| accessdate=2008-03-04|date=15 January 2006}}</ref>)

==Project history==
===Budget===
The cost of the project was 1.5 billion rubles ($64.4 million USD).<ref name="en.rian.ru"/> Project funding for the timeframe 2009<U+2013>2012, including post-launch operations, was about 2.4 billion rubles.<ref name="preflight">{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/phobos_grunt_preflight.html|title=Preparing for flight|last=Zak|first=Anatoly|publisher=Russianspaceweb.com|accessdate=26 May 2009}}</ref> The total cost of the mission was to have been 5 billion rubles ($163 million USD).

According to lead scientist [[Alexander V. Zakharov|Alexander Zakharov]], the entire spacecraft and most of the instruments were new, though the designs draw upon the nation's legacy of three successful [[Luna programme|Luna missions]], which in the 1970s retrieved a few hundred grams of Moon rocks.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/russia-takes-aim-at-phobos-1.9303|title=Russia takes aim at Phobos|work=Nature|date=4 November 2011}}</ref> Zakharov had described the Phobos sample return project as "possibly the most difficult interplanetary one to date."<ref name="mt_prelaunch"/>

[[File:Phobos Grunt base section model.jpg|thumb|Mockup of the spacecraft's main propulsion unit]]
The Fobos-Grunt project began in 1999, when the [[Russian Space Research Institute]] and [[NPO Lavochkin]], the main developer of Soviet and Russian interplanetary probes, initiated a 9 million [[Russian rouble|rouble]] feasibility study into a Phobos sample-return mission.  The initial spacecraft design was to be similar to the probes of the [[Fobos]] program launched in the late 1980s.<ref name="harvey_fobos"/> Development of the spacecraft started in 2001 and the preliminary design was completed in 2004.<ref name="en.rian.ru"/> For years, the project stalled as a result of low levels of financing of the Russian space program. This changed in the summer of 2005, when the new government plan for space activities in 2006<U+2013>2015 was published. Fobos-Grunt was now made one of the program's flagship missions. With substantially improved funding, the launch date was set for October 2009. The 2004 design was revised a couple of times and international partners were invited to join the project.<ref name="harvey_fobos">{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Brian|title=The Rebirth of the Russian Space Program|publisher=Springer|location=Germany|year=2007|edition=1st|chapter=Resurgent <U+2013> the new projects|pages=326<U+2013>330|isbn=978-0-387-71354-0}}</ref> In June 2006, NPO Lavochkin announced that it had begun manufacturing and testing the development version of the spacecraft's onboard equipment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/science/20100909/160532461.html|title=Russia to test unmanned lander for Mars moon mission|agency=RIA Novosti|date=9 September 2010}}</ref>

On 26 March 2007, Russia and China signed a cooperative agreement on the joint exploration of Mars, which included sending China's first interplanetary probe, [[Yinghuo-1]], to Mars together with the Fobos-Grunt spacecraft.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20081205/118704675.html|title=China to launch probe to Mars with Russian help in 2009|agency=RIA Novosti|date=5 December 2008}}</ref> Yinghuo-1 weighed 115&nbsp;kg (250&nbsp;pounds) and would have been released by the main spacecraft into a Mars orbit.<ref name="Popovkin" />

===Partners===
[[NPO Lavochkin]] was the project's main contractor developing its components. The Chief Designer of Fobos-Grunt was [[Maksim Martynov]].<ref>[http://ria.ru/authors/martynov_maksim/bio.html Biography of Maksim Martynov]{{ref-ru}}</ref> Phobos soil sampling and downloading were developed by the GEOHI RAN Institute of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (Vernadski Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical chemistry) and the integrated scientific studies of Phobos and Mars by remote and contact methods were the responsibility of the [[Russian Space Research Institute]],<ref name="ESA_PMR"/> where [[Alexander Zakharov (IKI)|Alexander Zakharov]] served as lead scientist of the mission<ref name="mt_prelaunch">{{cite news|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/mars-moon-lander-to-return-russia-to-deep-space/447350.html|title=Mars Moon Lander to Return Russia to Deep Space |work=The Moscow Times|date=8 November 2011}}</ref>

The Chinese [[Yinghuo-1]] orbiter was launched together with Fobos-Grunt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2007/05/with-a-russian-hitch-hike-china-heading-to-mars/ |title=With a Russian hitch-hike, China heading to Mars| date=21 May 2007 |first=Chris|last=Bergin|publisher=NASAspaceflight}}</ref> In late 2012, after a 10<U+2013>11.5-month cruise, Yinghuo-1 would have separated and entered a 800<U+00D7>80,000&nbsp;km equatorial orbit (5<U+00B0> inclination) with a period of three days. The spacecraft was expected to remain on Martian orbit for one year. Yinghuo-1 would have focused mainly on the study of the external environment of Mars. Space center researchers expected to use photographs and data to study the magnetic field of Mars and the interaction between [[ionosphere]]s, escape particles and [[solar wind]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200705/30/eng20070530_379330.html|title =China and Russia join hands to explore Mars|work= [[People's Daily]]|date=30 May 2007|accessdate=31 May 2007}}</ref>

A second Chinese payload, the Soil Offloading and Preparation System (SOPSYS), was integrated in the lander. SOPSYS was a microgravity grinding tool developed by the [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-03/28/content_838049.htm|title =Chinese satellite to orbit Mars in 2009|work=China Daily|date=27 March 2007|last=Zhao |first=Huanxin}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hktrader.net/200705/lead/lead-SpaceMission200705.htm|title =HK triumphs with out of this world invention |publisher= HK Trader |date=1 May 2007}}</ref>

Another payload on Fobos-Grunt was an experiment from the [[Planetary Society]] called [[Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment]]; its goal was to test whether selected [[organism]]s can survive a few years in [[outer space|deep space]] by flying them through interplanetary space. The experiment would have tested one aspect of [[transpermia]], the hypothesis that life could survive space travel, if protected inside rocks blasted by impact off one planet to land on another.<ref name=planetary-life>{{cite web |url=http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/innovative_technologies/life/ |title=Projects: LIFE Experiment: Phobos |publisher=[[The Planetary Society]] |accessdate=2 April 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/phobosdeimos2007/pdf/7043.pdf Living interplanetary flight experiment (LIFE): An experiment on the survivalability of microorganisms during interplanetary travel]</ref><ref name=Zak1>{{cite web |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/space-exploration/Mission_Possible.html?c=y&page=4 |first=Anatoly |last=Zak |title=Mission Possible |date=1 September 2008 |work=[[Air & Space Magazine]] |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |accessdate=26 May 2009}}</ref><ref name="ASMp4"/><ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Planetary Society|url=http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/life/ |title=LIFE Experiment: Phobos}}</ref>

===Postponed 2009 launch===
The October 2009 launch date could not be achieved due to delays in the spacecraft development.

Two firings of the main propulsion unit in Earth orbit were required to send the spacecraft onto the interplanetary trajectory. Since both engine ignitions would have taken place outside the range of Russian ground stations, the project participants asked volunteers around the world to take optical observations of the burns, e.g. with telescopes, and report the results to enable more accurate prediction of the mission flight path upon entry into the range of Russian ground stations.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://freze.it/SitpPS | title = We need your support in the project "Phobos-Soil" | accessdate =22 April 2012 |year=2011 | publisher = [[Russian Space Research Institute]]}}</ref>

The [[European Space Operations Centre]] (ESOC) in [[Darmstadt]] reported that the contact was made at 20:25 UTC on 22 November 2011 after some modifications had been made to the 15&nbsp;m dish facility in [[Perth]] to improve its chances of getting a signal.<ref name=BBCNOV23>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15850516 |title=Signal picked from Russia's stranded Mars probe |publisher=BBC News |first=Jonathan |last=Amos |date=23 November 2011}}</ref> No [[telemetry]] was received in this communication.<ref name="SF">{{cite web | url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1111/23phobosgrunt/ |title=It's alive!

The [[US Strategic Command]]<U+2019>s [[Joint Space Operations Center]] (JSpOC) tracked the probe and identified at the start of December that Fobos-Grunt had an elliptical orbit at an altitude of between 130 miles (209 km) and 190 miles (305 km), but falling a few miles each day.<ref>{{cite news | first = Michael Listner | title = Phobos-Grunt: a legal analysis of potential liability and options for mitigation | date = 14 November 2011 | url = http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1968/1 | work = The Space Review | accessdate =20 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/story/2011-12-02/russian-mars-probe/51550560/1 | work=USA Today | title=Most Popular E-mail Newsletter | date=1 December 2011}}</ref>

===Re-entry===
Before reentry, the spacecraft still carried about 7.51 metric tonnes of highly toxic [[hydrazine]] and [[nitrogen tetroxide]] on board.<ref name=vlad>[http://www.rdmag.com/News/2011/11/General-Science-Spacecraft-Russian-scientists-struggle-to-save-Mars-moon-probe/ Vladimir Ischenkov <U+2013> ''Russian scientists struggle to save Mars moon probe'' (9 November 2011) <U+2013> Associated Press]</ref><ref name="Popovkin">{{cite news | first = Mike Wall | title = Russia Still Trying to Contact Stranded Mars Moon Probe | date = 14 November 2011 | url = http://www.space.com/13618-russia-phobos-grunt-mars-spacecraft-silent.html | publisher = Space.com | accessdate =20 May 2012}}</ref> This was mostly fuel for the spacecraft's upper stage.

===Aftermath===
Initially, the head of Roscosmos [[Vladimir Popovkin]], suggested that the Fobos-Grunt failure might have been the result of sabotage by a foreign nation.<ref>[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/01/10/phobos_grunt_failure_sabotage/ "Foreign sabotage suspected in Phobos-Grunt meltdown"], theregister.co.uk, 10 January 2012</ref><ref name="msnbc-10-Jan-2012">[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45943952/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/russian-space-chief-claims-space-failures-may-be-sabotage/ "Russian space chief claims space failures may be sabotage"], msnbc.com, 10 January 2012</ref> He also stated that risky technical decisions had been made because of limited funding.

==Mission plan==
===Journey===
The spacecraft's journey to Mars would take about ten months. After arriving in Mars orbit, the main propulsion unit and the transfer truss would separate and the Chinese Mars orbiter would be released. Fobos-Grunt would then spend several months studying the planet and its moons from orbit, before landing on [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]]. It was imperative to prevent the introduction to Mars of contaminants from Earth; according to Fobos-Grunt Chief Designer [[Maksim Martynov]], the probability of the probe accidentally reaching the surface of Mars was much lower than the maximum specified for Category&nbsp;III missions, the type assigned to Fobos-Grunt and defined in [[COSPAR]]'s [[planetary protection]] policy (in accordance with [[wikisource:Outer Space Treaty of 1967#Article IX|Article IX]] of the Outer Space Treaty).<ref name=rian_martynov_answers>{{cite web | url = http://ria.ru/online/456770097.html | title = Russia resumes missions to outer space: what is after Phobos?}}{{ref-ru}}</ref><ref name=cospar_ppp>{{cite web | url =http://cosparhq.cnes.fr/Scistr/Pppolicy.htm | title =COSPAR Planetary Protection Policy}}</ref>

===On Phobos===
[[File:Phobos colour 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Phobos]]
The planned landing site at Phobos was a region from 5<U+00B0>S to 5<U+00B0>N, 230<U+00B0> to 235<U+00B0>E.<ref>{{cite web|title=Phobos Flyby Images: Proposed Landing Sites for the Forthcoming Phobos-Grunt Mission|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100315125645.htm|work=Science Daily|accessdate=7 November 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/631nmiHG8|archivedate=7 November 2011|date=15 March 2010}}</ref> Soil sample collection would begin immediately after the lander touched down on Phobos, with collection lasting 2<U+2013>7 days. An emergency mode existed for the case of communications breakdown, which enabled the lander to automatically launch the return rocket to deliver the samples to Earth.<ref name="ASMp2"/>

A robotic arm would have collected samples up to {{convert|0.5|in|cm}} in diameter. At the end of the arm was a pipe-shaped tool which split to form a claw. The tool contained a piston which would have pushed the sample into a cylindrical container. A light-sensitive photo-diode would have confirmed whether material collection was successful and also allowed visual inspection of the digging area. The sample extraction device would have performed 15 to 20 scoops yielding a total of {{convert|3|to|5.5|oz|g|}} of soil.<ref name="ASMp2">{{cite web|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/space-exploration/Mission_Possible.html?c=y&page=2 |title=Mission Possible |author=Zak}}</ref> The samples would be loaded into a capsule which would then be moved inside a special pipeline into the descent module by inflating an elastic bag within the pipe with gas.<ref name="en.rian.ru">{{cite web|first=Yury |last=Zaitsev |agency=RIA Novosti|url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20080714/113951848.html |title=Russia to study Martian moons once again|date=14 July 2008}}</ref><ref name=rian_martynov_answers/> Because the characteristics of Phobos soil are uncertain, the lander included another soil-extraction device, a Polish-built drill, which would have been used in case the soil turned out to be too rocky for the main scooping device.<ref name="universetoday_daring"/><ref name="zak_bbc_rebirth"/>

After the departure of the return stage, the lander's experiments would have continued ''in situ'' on Phobos' surface for a year. To conserve power, mission control would have turned these on and off in a precise sequence. The robotic arm would have placed more samples in a chamber that would heat it and analyze its [[Emission spectrum|Emission spectra]]. This analysis might have been able to determine the presence of volatile compounds, such as water.<ref name="ASMp2"/>

===Sample return to Earth===
The return stage was mounted on top of the lander. It would have needed to accelerate to {{convert|35|km/h|0|abbr=on}} to escape Phobos' gravity. In order to avoid harming the experiments remaining at the lander, the return stage would have ignited its engine once the vehicle had been vaulted to a safe height by springs. It would then have begun maneuvers for the eventual trip to Earth, where it would have arrived in August 2014.<ref name="ASMp2" /> An 11-kg descent vehicle containing the capsule with soil samples (up to {{convert|0.2|kg|abbr=on}}) would have been released on direct approach to Earth at {{convert|12|km/s|abbr=on}}.<ref name="esa_spacecraft">[http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=49090 Phobos Soil <U+2013> Spacecraft] European Space Agency</ref> Following the aerodynamic braking to {{convert|30|m/s|abbr=on}} the conical-shaped descent vehicle would perform a hard landing without a parachute within the [[Sary Shagan]] test range in [[Kazakhstan]].<ref name=rian_martynov_answers/> The vehicle did not have any radio equipment.<ref name="universetoday_daring"/> Ground-based radar and optical observations would have been used to track the vehicle's return.<ref name="zak_phobos_grunt_scenario">[http://www.russianspaceweb.com/phobos_grunt_scenario.html The mission scenario of the Phobos-Grunt project] Anatoly Zak</ref>

==Scientific critiques==
Barry E. DiGregorio, Director of the International Committee Against Mars Sample Return (ICAMSR), criticised the [[Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment|LIFE experiment]] carried by Fobos-Grunt as a violation of the [[Outer Space Treaty]] due to the possibility of contamination of Phobos or Mars with the microbial spores and live bacteria it contains should it have lost control and crash-landed on either body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20827924.300-dont-send-bugs-to-mars.html?full=true|title=Don't send bugs to Mars|last=DiGregorio|first=Barry E.|date=28 December 2010|work=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=8 January 2011}}</ref> It is speculated that the heat-resistant extremophile bacteria could survive such a crash, on the basis that Microbispora bacteria survived the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2005.12.002 | title = Microbial survival in space shuttle crash | year = 2006 | last1 = McLean | first1 = R | last2 = Welsh | first2 = A | last3 = Casasanto | first3 = V | journal = Icarus | volume = 181 | pages = 323<U+2013>325 | pmid = 21804644 | issue = 1 | pmc = 3144675|bibcode = 2006Icar..181..323M }}</ref>

According to Fobos-Grunt Chief Designer [[Maksim Martynov]], the probability of the probe accidentally reaching the surface of Mars was much lower than the maximum specified for Category&nbsp;III missions, the type assigned to Fobos-Grunt and defined in [[COSPAR]]'s [[planetary protection]] policy (in accordance with [[wikisource:Outer Space Treaty of 1967#Article IX|Article IX]] of the Outer Space Treaty).<ref name=rian_martynov_answers>{{cite web | url = http://ria.ru/online/456770097.html | title = Russia resumes missions to outer space: what is after Phobos?}}{{ref-ru}}</ref><ref name=cospar_ppp>{{cite web | url =http://cosparhq.cnes.fr/Scistr/Pppolicy.htm | title =COSPAR Planetary Protection Policy}}</ref>
