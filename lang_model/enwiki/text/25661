The '''...Baby One More Time Tour''' was the debut [[concert tour]] by American recording artist [[Britney Spears]]. It supported her debut studio album, ''[[...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and visited United States and Canada. The tour was announced in March 1999, with dates released a month later. [[Tommy Hilfiger]] was chosen as the tour sponsor. An extension of the tour, titled '''Crazy 2K''', was announced in December 1999. Tour sponsors of the second leg were [[Got Milk?]] and [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]]. The concept and costumes were designed by Spears. The stage was changed at the beginning of the second leg to include pyrotechnics and special effects. 

The show was divided into various segments, with each segment being followed by an interlude to the next segment, and it ended with an encore. The setlist consisted of songs from her debut album and several [[cover version|cover]]s. Some changes were made during the 2000 leg, with the covers replaced by songs Spears premiered from her second studio album, ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again]]''. The tour received positive critical appreciation from critics. During the tour, Spears was accused of lip synching, although she denied these claims. The show was recorded and broadcasted on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. A DVD entitled ''[[Live and More!]]'' was also released.

During the time of the announcement, Spears was being featured in the "AllStars" campaign launched by the company. Hilfiger spoke about the sponsorship saying,
<blockquote>
"My passion for music has always inspired my designs. This year we have really put music in the forefront of everything we do. Britney represents the spirit of Tommy Jeans and of youth today. I cannot think of a better way to continue this exciting year by sponsoring one of today's hottest, young recording artists".<ref name=tommy>{{cite press release |title=Tommy Hilfiger Announces Sponsorship of Britney Spears Summer Concert Tour|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1999_May_12/ai_54609972/ |publisher= Business Wire |date=1999-05-12 |accessdate=2010-07-17}}</ref>

The encore consisted of a performance of "[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]", in which Spears wore a black bra under pink [[halter]], a pink sequined plaid mini-skirt, and black [[thigh-high stockings]].<ref name=sfc/>

In the 2000 leg, the show started with a skit in which the dancers came out of [[locker (cabinet)|lockers]] and stayed in the stage until a bell rang. They all sat until a female teacher voice started calling their names. After the teacher called Spears, she emerged at the top of the staircase in a cloud of smoke, wearing a top and white stretch pants, to perform a short dance mix of "...Baby One More Time".<ref name=rolling/> She then entered one of the lockers and appeared in another one on the opposite side of the stage to perform "(You Drive Me) Crazy".<ref name=stpeter>{{cite news|url=http://www.cm-life.com/2000/03/17/oopsbritneydrivesuscrazyonemoretime/|title=She drives them crazy, sometimes|date=2000-04-10|accessdate=2010-01-16|last=Hernandez|first=Christina|work=[[St. Petersburg Times ]]|publisher=[[Times Publishing Company]]}}</ref> Spears briefly talked to the audience, the segment continued with performances of "Born to Make You Happy" and "I Will Be There".

When she returned to the stage, she performed another song from her upcoming album, "[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]". Spears addressed the audience again before the "Who is the Ultimate Heartbreaker?" interlude, in which her dancers picked a boy from the audience and invited him onstage.<ref name=cmlife>{{cite news|url=http://www.cm-life.com/2000/03/17/oopsbritneydrivesuscrazyonemoretime/|title=Oops!

== Critical reception==
The tour garnered generally positive reviews from critics.<ref name=usatoday/> Jeffrey Haney of the ''[[Deseret News]]'' described the show as "funky and flashy".<ref name=deseretn>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3OwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vuwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1996,4799710&dq=britney+tour&hl=en|title=Teen Queen Spears reigns at State Fair|date=1999-09-11|accessdate=2010-01-01|last=Haney|first=Jeffrey P.|work=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret Management Corporation]]}}</ref> A reporter from ''[[USA Today]]'' called Spears' performance "assured and energetic".<ref name=usatoday/> Jim Farber of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' pointed out that Spears seemed to have two [[persona]]s during the show, one when singing songs from her album and a more edgy look when singing the covers. He also added that "Spears' nods to edginess no doubt reflects her desire to grow into a more mature career".<ref name=dailyn>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1999/07/09/1999-07-09_britney_s_act__it_s_so_schizo.html|title=BRITNEY'S ACT: IT'S SO SCHIZO|date=1999-07-09|accessdate=2010-01-01|last=Farber|first=Jim|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|publisher=[[Mortimer Zuckerman]]}}</ref> Jae-Ha Kim of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' said that Spears "showed why she has got a leg up on blonder competitors such as [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Mandy Moore]]. Aguilera may have a better voice (and a [[Grammy]] to validate it), but Spears has that 'it' factor that worked for pinup queens of the past, such as [[Farrah Fawcett]]".<ref name=chicago>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4530485.html|title=Tonight at Allstate Arena Sold out Recommended|date=2000-03-23|accessdate=2010-01-18|last=Kim|first=Jae-Ha|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]}}</ref> Adam Graham of [[Central Michigan Life]] commented that "although the show was only about 10 songs long and the authenticity of her voice was in question throughout, it was really truly hard to walk away feeling anything but completely gratified".<ref name=cmlife/> Dave Tianen of the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' believed that the show "was energetic, good-humored, fast-paced and bright".<ref name=journal/> Jane Ganahl of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' said that "she may be somewhat entertaining, but she's also just another prefab act - longer on packaging than actual talent".<ref name=sfc/>

==Accusations of lipsynching==
During the tour, accusations of [[lip synch]]ing arose. Spears talked to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' about the accusations, saying,
<blockquote>
"There's a delay in the screen above me, so if you listen to the music and watch the screen, they don't sync up. I think that confuses people. But I'm singing every song. I'm singing my ass off. [...] There are times during the show, when I'm dancing so much, where I get out of breath, and we have a signal where I'm dying and they'll help me out. Believe me, I'd give anything to do a show where I just sit there and sing".<ref name=rolling/>
</blockquote>
