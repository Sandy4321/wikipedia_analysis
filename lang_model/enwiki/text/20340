'''Charlie Dominici''', born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], is a singer best known as the second [[vocalist]] for the [[progressive metal]] band [[Dream Theater]], having replaced [[Chris Collins (singer)|Chris Collins]] (while the band was called Majesty) and later being replaced by [[James LaBrie]].

==Biography==
Charlie originally came into prominence as a member of [[Franke and the Knockouts]], in which he played guitar and sang backing vocals. He auditioned for Dream Theater in [[1987]] and was hired for the job in November of that year.

Charlie performed on the band's debut album, [[1989 in music|1989]]'s ''[[When Dream and Day Unite]]''. However, Dominici was older than the rest of the band and there were personal and creative differences at work. It was felt that, despite being a very talented singer, his decidedly "pop" vocal style did not fit in with the distinctive progressive direction that the band's compositions were taking. According to [[Dream Theater]] [[drummer]] [[Mike Portnoy]], "It was like having [[Billy Joel]] singing in [[Queensr<U+00FF>che]]." A good singer in the wrong band, they amicably parted ways shortly thereafter.

Charlie remained in contact with Dream Theater throughout their career, despite lapsing out of the music business and obtaining a job as a finance manager in the automobile business.  Charlie was hired by Mike Portnoy to sing at his wedding to Marlene Apuzzo.  Charlie started working on an album with his brother, guitarist Kane Daily, that never saw the light of day.  In 2003 he released a song on his website entitled "Now The Time Has Come" but it was taken down after a few months, and the track did not feature any guitars, only piano.

Charlie's voice was also heard on the [[YtseJam Records]] release "When Dream And Day Unite Demos" which featured pre-production and vocal demos of several songs, as well as Charlie singing Beatles Covers and the traditional Christmas song [[O Holy Night]].

On March 6th, 2004, Charlie joined his former bandmates onstage in Los Angeles for the first time in 15 years for a special performance celebrating the 15th anniversary of the band's first album.  After the band performed the entire album, they began playing "To Live Forever" a non-album track that was written in the same time period, and singer [[James LaBrie]] announced Charlie, who sang most of the song.  The band then launched into "Metropolis" which was also written in that time period, with Charlie and James singing a duet, and also being joined by former keyboardist [[Derek Sherinian]]. This performance was later released by YtseJamRecords on CD and DVD versions entitled "When Dream And Day Reunite".  The DVD version also features footage from the band's 1989 tour with Charlie of each song, as well as documentary footage.  Despite having not actively sung since leaving [[Dream Theater]] in 1989, this performance gave him the itch to make music again and in 2005, he released a solo album entitled ''O<sub>3</sub>: A Trilogy, Part 1'', the first album of what will be a three-album concept piece.

Charlie has now inked a deal for a worldwide release on the "InsideOut Music" label for his second installment of the trilogy, ''O<sub>3</sub>: A Trilogy, Part 2'', which was released in February 2007. This CD is much heavier and progressive and was recorded with a full band under the band name Dominici.

Dominici will open for [[Dream Theater]] at 3 shows at their Chaos in Motion World Tour this summer.
