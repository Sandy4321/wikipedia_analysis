'''''Jaws 3-D''''' (a.k.a. '''''Jaws 3''''') is a [[1983 in film|1983]] [[horror film|horror]]&ndash;[[thriller film]] directed by [[Joe Alves]]. It is the second sequel to [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[48th Academy Awards|1975 Oscar]] winning classic ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''. 

As [[SeaWorld]], a water park with underwater tunnels and lagoons, prepares to open, a [[great white shark]] infiltrates the barrier, attacking and killing water skiers and engineers. Once the shark is captured, it becomes apparent that a much larger shark is present.

The film is notable for making use of [[3-D film]] during the revived interest in the technology in the 1980s, amongst other horror films such as ''[[Friday the 13th Part 3]]'' and ''[[Amityville 3-D]]''. Cinema audiences could wear disposable cardboard [[polarized glasses]] to create the illusion that elements penetrate the screen.<ref name="Ankeney">{{cite web|first=Jay|last=Ankeney|title=Underwater with Hydroflex's Pete Romano|work=HydroFlex Inc|url=http://www.hydroflex.com/site/about/crplanet.html|date=March 13, 2000|accessdate=2007-01-04}}</ref> Several shots and sequences were designed to utilise the effect, such as the shark's destruction.  Since the 3-D is ineffective in home viewing, the alternative title  ''Jaws 3'' is used for television broadcasts, VHS and DVD.<ref name="jabootu">{{cite web| author=Ken Begg| title=Jaws 3-D - Jabootu's Bad Movie Dimension |url=http://www.jabootu.com/jaws3-D.htm |accessdate=2006-11-25}}</ref>

==Synopsis==
{{spoiler-about|"Jaws 3-D"}}
The oldest son from the first two ''Jaws'' films, Michael Brody (played by [[Dennis Quaid]]) now works for [[SeaWorld]] in [[Florida]], which is preparing for the launch of its new "Undersea Kingdom," a set of tunnels where people can "view the wonders of the deep without ever getting wet."  The film opens with a great white following a team of waterskiers, among them Kelly ([[Lea Thompson]]).  Their boat stalls, but then its driver gets it going again before anyone is attacked.

Michael Brody is the chief engineer, and lives with his girlfriend, Kaye Morgan ([[Bess Armstrong]]), who is senior biologist at the park. Kaye and her assistants, Dan and Liz, wonder why the dolphins are acting so afraid of leaving their pen.  As Sean ([[John Putch]]), Michael's brother, arrives to visit, he reveals a deep fear about the water caused by the events depicted in ''[[Jaws 2]]''. Kelly, after meeting Michael, Sean, and Kaye in a bar, tries to dispel the phobia by playing in the water [[Skinny dipping|naked]] at nighttime. 

Meanwhile, Shelly Overman ([[Harry Grant (actor)|Harry Grant]]), one of the mechanics, dives into the water at dusk to repair the gates. He is attacked by a shark and killed. The next day, Michael and Kaye go down in a submarine to check the water and find Overman.  They decide to go into a piece of scenery, the Spanish galleon, although encouraged by Kaye's two dolphins to stay away.  They continue the search, leaving the submarine, only to be assaulted by a great white.  The dolphins respond to Kaye's waving hands, and allow Michael and Kaye to ride them back to the dolphin pen.

The baby great white is captured and nursed to partial health by Kaye and Liz. Calvin ([[Louis Gossett, Jr.]]) orders it exhibited as being the first Great White in captivity, but it dies within days. 

Meanwhile, Kelly forces Sean to join her on the bumper boats, not granting any credence to his fear of the sea.  But, at the underwater tunnel, a girl is terrified when she sees a hideous corpse, later revealed to be Overman, bob up to a window.  Kaye reveals that the bites came from a shark with a mouth a yard across.  That means that the shark's ''mother'' has also breached the gates of the park, but she can't convince Calvin of this fact until the shark herself shows up at the window of their underwater cafe.  The shark exacts her revenge, first by causing a leak that nearly drowns everyone in the underwater tunnel. She then turns her attention to everyone on the beach.  She fails to capture the waterskiers, but capsizes Sean and Kelly's bumper boat, wounding the latter.  

FitzRoyce ([[Simon MacCorkindale]]) leads the shark into the filtration pipes where the water from the ocean is brought into the lagoon, hoping to trap her inside. However, he drifts right into her mouth when his lifeline rope snaps.  He prepares a grenade, but he is crushed to death before he can use it.

Unaware of this, Michael has gone down to repair the underwater tunnel so the technicians can restore air pressure and drain the water, with Kaye to watch his back.  He welds the repair piece, but, with no pressure in the pipe to restrain her, the shark attacks but are protected by the dolphins. They return to the control room with Calvin and the technicians.  But, the shark smashes through the [[acrylic glass]], flooding the room. As everyone tries to escape, Mike notices that FitzRoyce's body is still resting in the shark's mouth with the grenade. Mike uses a pole to detonate the grenade and it explodes.

==Production history==
[[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] and [[Richard Zanuck]], the [[film producer|producers]] for the first two films, originally pitched this idea as a [[Parody|spoof]] named ''Jaws 3, People 0'' after the success of ''[[Airplane!]]''.<ref name="jabootu"/> However, Brown says that it would be like "fouling in your own nest."<ref name="makingof">''The Making of Jaws 2'', ''Jaws 2'' DVD documentary, [2002]</ref>

The screenplay was based on [[Guerdon Trueblood]]'s story about a white shark swimming upstream and becoming trapped in a lake.<ref name="Saxelid">{{cite web|first=Chadwick H |last=Saxelid |title=JAWS 3
(a.k.a. JAWS 3-D) |url=http://www.scifilm.org/reviews/jaws3.html|accessdate=2007-01-19}}</ref> The script was written by [[Carl Gottlieb]] and [[Richard Matheson]]. Gottlieb had revised the screenplays for the first two ''Jaws'' films, and Matheson had written the script for Spielberg's celebrated 1971 [[television movie]] ''[[Duel (film)|Duel]]''.<ref name="Scheib">{{cite web|first=Richard |last=Scheib |title= JAWS 3-D aka JAWS III Rating: <U+00BD> |work=The SF, Horror and Fantasy Film Review |url=http://www.moria.co.nz/horror/jaws3.htm|year=1990 |accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref> However, Matheson has reported in interviews that the screenplay was revised by "script doctors".<ref name="Saxelid"/>

The film was directed by Joe Alves, who had worked on the first two films as [[production designer]] and as [[second unit director]] for ''Jaws 2''. It had been suggested that Alves co-direct the first sequel with [[Verna Fields]] when first director [[John D. Hancock]] left the project.<ref name="makingof"/>

===3-D===

There was a revival in popularity of [[3-D film|3-D]] at this time, with many films using the technique. ''Jaws''' second sequel integrated the technology into its title, as did ''[[Amityville 3-D]]''. ''[[Friday the 13th Part 3]]'' could also make dual use of the number three.<ref name="jabootu"/> The gimmick was also advertised in the tagline "the third dimension is terror."<ref name="Saxelid"/>

[[Image:Jaws_3_-_shark_explosion_-_3-D_effect.jpg|thumb|280px|The shark's jaws coming towards the screen after its destruction. Audiences might perceive that they were coming into the auditorium.]]
Cinema audiences could wear disposable cardboard [[polarized glasses]] to view the film, creating the illusion that elements from the film were penetrating the screen to come towards the viewers. The opening sequence makes obvious use of the technique, with the titles flying to the forefront of the screen, leaving a [[Doppler effect|trail]]. There are more subtle instances in the film where props are meant to leave the screen. The more obvious examples are in the climatic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3-D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting through the screen, ending with its jaws. 

It is a common misconception<ref name="dvddu"/> that ''Jaws 3-D'' was filmed using two cameras simultaneously to achieve the effect. In fact, as the credits of the movie indicate, it was shot using the [[Arrivision 3D]] system.<ref>{{cite web|title=Technical specifications for Jaws 3-D from IMDb|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0085750/technical|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref> This is a means of shooting 3D movies in normal colour with a single camera and single strip of film: the Arrivision 3D technique uses a special twin-lens adapter fitted to the film camera, and divides the 35mm film frame in half along the middle, capturing the left-eye image in the upper half of the frame and the right-eye image in the lower half - this is known as "over/under". This allows filming to proceed as for any standard 2D movie, without the considerable additional expense of having to double up on cameras and film stock for every shot. When the resultant film is projected through a normal projector (albeit one requiring a special lens that combines the upper and lower images), a true polarised 3D image is produced. This system allows 3D films to be shown in almost any cinema (provided the required lens is obtained), since it does not require two projectors running simultaneously through the presentation - something most cinemas are not equipped to handle.

According to the company that built the underwater camera housings for ''Jaws 3-D'', the underwater sequences were shot using an [[Arriflex]] 35-3 camera with Arrivision 18mm over/under 3D lens.<ref name="Ankeney"/>

This kind of 3D effect does not work on television without special electronic hardware at the viewer's end, and so with one exception, the home video and broadcast TV versions of ''Jaws 3-D'' were created using just the left-eye image, and with the title changed to "Jaws 3" or "Jaws III". Because the left-eye image only takes up half the 35mm film frame, the picture resolution is noticeably poorer than would normally be expected of a movie shot on 35mm.

The above-mentioned exception was a 1986 release of the movie for the now-obsolete [[VHD]] video disc system (not to be confused with [[LaserDisc]]). This required a special 3D VHD player, or a standard VHD player with a hardware 3D adapter, and a set of LCD glasses that shuttered the viewer's eyes according to control signals sent by the player, allowing the polarised 3D effect to work.<ref>{{cite web|title=VHD DiscWorld 3D Compatible Video|url=http://disclord.tripod.com/vhddiscworld/id1.html|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref>

[[TV3 (Malaysia)|TV3]] in Malaysia tried to broadcast the 3D version of the film in 2001. The event was advertised heavily and required viewers to buy a pair of anaglyph glasses to fully enjoy the movie; this was an anaglyph 3D version of the film created from the Arrivision original.<ref>{{cite news|title=TV3 pitches in for the blind|work=Portal Ilmu|url=http://portalilmu.kempen.gov.my/index.php?ch=24&pg=138&ac=5076&lang=eng|format=Web reprint from [[The Malay Mail]]|date=Jan 23, 2001|accessdate=2006-11-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Pandangan untuk TV3 dan ntv7|work=Portal Ilmu|url=http://portalilmu.kempen.gov.my/index.php?ch=12&pg=133&ac=5517|date=Apr 22, 2001|accessdate=2006-11-25}}</ref>

This film was referenced in the [[1989 in film|1989 film]] ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]''. When [[Marty McFly]] arrives in [[Hill Valley]] in the year 2015 he sees that a movie theatre that is playing ''"Jaws 19"'', as in the 19th installment of the franchise. The shark from the poster leaps out at him, "eating" him, taking him by surprise and causing him to cower in fear. The shark disappears, revealing it to be a 3-D model. He gets up off the ground, shrugs, and calmly says, "The shark still looks fake."<ref>{{cite web |title=Memorable Quotes from ''Back to the Future Part II'' (1989) |work=IMDb |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096874/quotes |accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref>

==Reception==
===Box office performance===
The film grossed $13,422,500 on its opening weekend, playing to 1,311 theaters at its widest release. This was 29.5% of its total gross. It has achieved total lifetime worldwide gross of $87,987,055.<ref>{{cite web|title=JAWS 3-D|work=BoxOffice Mojo|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jaws3d.htm|accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref> This illustrates the series' diminishing returns, since ''Jaws 3-D'' has earned nearly $100,000,000 less than the total lifetime gross of its predecessor<ref>{{cite web|title=Jaws 2|work=Box Office Mojo|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jaws2.htm|accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref> and $300,000,000 less than the original film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jaws |work=Box Office Mojo|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jaws.htm|accessdate=2007-01-11}}</ref> The final sequel would attract an even lower income, with around two thirds of ''Jaws 3-D'''s total lifetime gross.<ref>{{cite web|title=JAWS IV: THE REVENGE|work=Box Office Mojo|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jaws4.htm|accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref>

===Reviews===
Reception for the movie was generally weak. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' calls it "tepid" and suggests that Alves "fails to linger long enough on the Great White."<ref>{{cite web|title=Jaws 3-D|work=Variety|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117792125.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0|date=Jan. 1, 1983|accessdate=2006-11-28}}</ref> It has a 11% fresh rating at [[rottentomatoes.com]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Jaws 3-D |work=Rotten Tomatoes| url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jaws_3/|accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref>

The 3-D was criticised as being a gimmick to attract audiences to the aging series<ref name="dvddu">{{cite web|title=DVD Review: Jaws 3|work=DVDown Under|url=http://dvdownunder.com.au/reviews/2001/jaws3.htm|accessdate=2006-11-28}}</ref> and for being ineffective.<ref>{{cite web|first=Roger|last=Ebert|title=Wings Of Courage|work=Roger Ebert Movie Reviews|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19960322/REVIEWS/603220307/1023|date= March 22, 1996|accessdate=2006-11-28}}</ref> All Movie Guide, however, says that "the suspense sequences were made somewhat more memorable during the film's original release with 3-D photography, an attribute lost on video, thereby removing the most distinctive element of an otherwise run-of-the-mill sequel."<ref>{{cite web|first=Judd|last=Blaise|title=Jaws 3|work=All Movie Guide|url=http://allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:25914|accessdate=2006-12-11}}</ref>

Derek Winnert says that "with Richard Matheson's name on the script you'd expect a better yarn" although he continues to say that the film "is entirely watchable with a big pack of popcorn."<ref>{{cite book|first=Derek|last=Winnert|year=1993|title=Radio Times Film & Video Guide 1994|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|location= London|id=ISBN 0-340-57477-1|pages=546}}</ref> Others are disappointed that Matheson and Gottleib produced this script given their previous success.<ref name="Saxelid"/>

Although most critics agree that ''[[Jaws 2]]'' is the best of the ''Jaws'' sequels, some are unsure if ''Jaws-3-D'' is better than ''[[Jaws: The Revenge]]''. One reviewer says of ''Jaws 3-D'':

<blockquote>Campy performances, cheesy special effects, and downright awful dialogue all contribute to making ''Jaws 3'' a truly dismal experience for just about everyone.  It's not only hard to believe that a sequel this downright abominable didn't kill the franchise, but that it actually would be followed by a movie that was arguably worse --  ''Jaws: the Revenge''.<ref name="leo">{{cite web|first=Vince |last=Leo |title=Jaws 3 (1983) / Horror-Adventure |work=Quipster's Movie Reviews |url=http://www.qwipster.net/jaws3.htm |accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref></blockquote>

Although there are many flaws, some critics describe the film as  "marginally entertaining."<ref>{{cite web|first=Almar |last=Haflidason |title=Jaws 3 (aka Jaws 3-D) (1983) |work=bbc.co.uk |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2000/07/14/jaws3_review.shtml |date=9 March 2001 |accessdate=2007-01-19}}</ref> The sound design has been commended, however. The moment when an infant's cry is heard when the baby shark dies in the pool is particularly praised by one reviewer.<ref name="Saxelid"/>

===Awards===
It was nominated for five [[1983 Golden Raspberry Awards]], including worst picture, director, supporting actor (Lou Gossett, Jr), screenplay, and newcomer (Cindy and Sandy, "The Shrieking Dolphins"). However, it "won" none.<ref>{{cite web|title=1983 Archive|work=Razzies.com|url=http://razzies.com/asp/content/XcNewsPlus.asp?cmd=view&articleid=23|accessdate=2006-12-10}}</ref>
