'''Jerrel Floyd Hasselbaink''' (born in [[Paramaribo]], [[Suriname]], 27 March 1972), usually known as '''Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink''',<ref>The story goes that Hasselbaink got his current football alias of ''Jimmy Floyd'' because his [[Portugal|Portuguese]] teammates could not pronounce his real first name; the nickname has stuck.</ref> is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] former [[Association football|football]] [[striker]] who played for various clubs in the Netherlands, [[Portugal]], [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Spain]], as well as the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]]. He scored more than 300 career goals. His nephew is Hamilton Academical player [[Nigel Hasselbaink]].

==Club career==
===Netherlands===
Hasselbaink was born in [[Paramaribo]], [[Suriname]], but began his footballing career in the [[Netherlands]], in the [[Eerste Divisie]] first with [[Telstar (football club)|Telstar]] for whom he played until 1991, and then [[AZ (football club)|Alkmaar Zaanstreek]]. He stayed at AZ for three seasons before being released by the club and ended up playing [[non-league]] football. (Neerlandia/SLTOVV)  {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

===Portugal===
He signed for [[Portugal|Portuguese]] side [[Campomaiorense]] in August 1995 but, after only one season, Hasselbaink was signed by [[Boavista FC|Boavista]] where he first came to prominence. He scored 20 goals in 23 league appearances for the club and helped them win the [[Cup of Portugal|Portuguese Cup]].

===Leeds United===
Hasselbaink's goalscoring caught the attention of several European clubs, and he was transferred to English [[Premier League]] side [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] for <U+00A3>2 million in June 1997. He continued his prolific goalscoring record with Leeds, netting 23 goals in all competitions in his debut season, and 21 in the next, helping Leeds finish 4th in the Premiership. His 18 league goals that season made him the Premier League's joint top goalscorer.

===Atl<U+00E9>tico de Madrid===
After rejecting a new contract offer from Leeds and subsequently requesting a transfer,<ref>{{cite news |title=Hasselbaink demands transfer |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/407038.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1999-07-30 |accessdate=2007-02-28 }}</ref> Hasselbaink was sold to [[Spain|Spanish]] club [[Atl<U+00E9>tico de Madrid]] for <U+00A3>12 million in 1999. He adapted to the [[Spain|Spanish]] game well, scoring 24 goals in 34 [[La Liga]] appearances and 32 in all competitions, though the club were still relegated.

===Chelsea===
Once again, he stayed with a club for only a brief period and a year later returned to [[England]], this time with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], for a club record fee of <U+00A3>15 million.

Hasselbaink scored 23 goals in 35 league appearances in the [[2000-01 in English football|2000-01]] season, including a volley from outside the [[penalty area]] against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and a four-goal haul against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]; he finished the season as the Premier League's top goal scorer. At the start of the next season he earned the distinction of scoring the first competitive goal at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]'s new [[St Mary's Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web 
|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/premiership/chelsea/reports/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/01/08/25/SOCCER_Southampton.html&TEAMHD=chelsea&DIV=prem&TEAM=CHELSEA&RH=Chelsea&PREV_SEASON=2000
|title=Southampton 0 Chelsea 2
|publisher=Sporting Life 
|date=25 August 2001 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref> He formed a productive partnership with [[Icelandic|Iceland]] striker [[Ei<U+00F0>ur Sm<U+00E1>ri Gu<U+00F0>johnsen|Ei<U+00F0>ur Gu<U+00F0>johnsen]] in his second year with Chelsea, scoring 29 goals in all competitions and helping Gu<U+00F0>johnsen to 23 in a season which also saw Chelsea reach the [[FA Cup]] final. Hasselbaink was injured in the game prior to the final and, clearly unfit, he was substituted early on at [[Millennium Stadium]] as Chelsea lost 2&ndash;0. In his last two seasons with Chelsea the goals dried up. He scored only 11 goals in 27 games in [[2002-03 in English football|2002-03]], though in the next season he scored 17 goals in all competitions which, despite the arrival of new strikers [[Adrian Mutu]] and [[Hern<U+00E1>n Crespo]], made him top scorer at the club for the third time in four years. He ended his Chelsea career with 87 goals in 177 games in the league.

===Middlesbrough===
In 2004, Hasselbaink joined [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] on a free transfer. In his first season he scored 13 goals in 36 league games. He struck the winner in 1&ndash;0 wins at [[Grasshopper-Club Z<U+00FC>rich|Grasshoppers]] in the [[UEFA Cup]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]. He also captained the side in a 4&ndash;1 win over Manchester United and scored the second goal for Boro. In his final season with the club, he helped them reach the [[UEFA Cup 2005-06|UEFA Cup]] final, where they lost 4&ndash;0 to [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]]

When [[Gareth Southgate]] took over from new [[England national football team|England]] boss [[Steve McClaren]] as Middlesbrough manager, Hasselbaink found himself surplus to requirements and was made available on a [[free transfer (soccer)|free transfer]]. His reported <U+00A3>40,000 per week wages at Middlesbrough looked to be an issue especially when negotiations with [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] failed. He left Middlesbrough as a hero with his fine goals and leadership which contributed massively to Middlesbrough's success domestically and in Europe in the two years he was at Middlesbrough. He signed for [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on 11 July.<ref>{{cite news |title=Addicks seal deal for Hasselbaink |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/charlton_athletic/5168142.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2006-07-11 |accessdate=2007-08-17 }}</ref>

===Later career===
Soon after joining Charlton, Hasselbaink was charged by [[The Football Association|The FA]] with improper conduct and/or bringing the game into disrepute for his claims about [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. He alleged that his former club paid players a bonus after the 2004 [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] win over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. A Premier League inquiry into what would have been illegal bonus payments found no evidence to support the claims, which were denied by Chelsea.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hasselbaink charged over Chelsea claims |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2006/07/31/ufnrup31.xml |publisher=Telegraph |date=2006-08-01 |accessdate=2007-02-28 }}</ref>

Hasselbaink scored his first goal for Charlton against his old team Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 9 September 2006,<ref>{{cite web 
|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/5308188.stm
|title=Chelsea 2-1 Charlton 
|publisher=[[BBC Sport]] 
|date=9 September 2006 |accessdate=15 September 2009}}</ref> but he did not celebrate out of respect for the fans.  Chelsea's fans in turn gave him a round of applause, even though his goal had brought Charlton level.  Hasselbaink was also instrumental in advising [[Scott Carson]] that [[Frank Lampard]]'s penalty would be struck down the middle of the goal, true to form this event transpired and Carson went on to save the penalty and keep Charlton in the game despite their subsequent loss.  He scored twice as Charlton edged [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] out of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] on penalties in November.<ref>{{cite web

|date=7 November 2006 |accessdate=15 September 2009}}</ref> After a long goal drought, Hasselbaink scored against yet another of his former clubs, Middlesbrough on 13 January 2007, a game which Middlesbrough went on to win.<ref>{{cite web

|title=Charlton 1-3 Middlesbrough 
|publisher=[[BBC Sport]] 
|date=13 January 2007 |accessdate=15 September 2009}}</ref> Like his previous goal against former club Chelsea he did not celebrate, as respect to Boro fans. Hasselbaink was released by Charlton at the end of the [[2006-07 in English football|2006-07]] season.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hasselbaink released by Charlton |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/charlton_athletic/6654289.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2007-05-14 |accessdate=2007-05-14 }}</ref>

Hasselbaink was on the verge of joining [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] on 14 August 2007, but the club later withdrew their offer.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/6946891.stm Hasselbaink baffled by Foxes snub], BBC Sport 14 August 2007.  Retrieved on 5 September 2007.</ref> On 16 August, [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] chairman [[Peter Ridsdale]], who worked with Hasselbaink at Leeds United, brought him to Cardiff on a one-year deal, teaming up with former [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and Leeds striker [[Robbie Fowler]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Hasselbaink signs for Bluebirds |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/6949220.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2007-08-16 |accessdate=2007-08-16 }}</ref>

Both Fowler and Hasselbaink started the season out of the team due to both lacking fitness and they eventually went on to make their debuts for the club in the same game, a 1&ndash;0 victory over [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] in the League Cup. On  19 September 2007, he scored his first goal for Cardiff with a 20-yard low drive in the 2&ndash;1 league defeat at home to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]. After an impressive performance against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in the fifth round of the FA Cup he was nominated for the player of the round after a goal which he powered the ball in to the top corner.<ref>[http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/footballnation/cardiff-city-fc/2008/02/22/hasselbaink-an-fa-nomination-91466-20510212/ "Hasselbaink an FA nomination"] [[South Wales Echo]] Retrieved on 22 February 2008</ref> Jimmy remained as a regular starter for Cardiff throughout the season, only losing his place for a handful of matches to an in-form [[Steven Thompson (Scottish footballer)|Steve Thompson]], although due to his age he rarely finished a match. On 15 March 2008, Hasselbaink received the first red card of his Cardiff career for a foul on [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] goalkeeper [[Dean Gerken]]. Cardiff appealed the red card but it was upheld<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/7303477.stm "Hasselbaink loses red card appeal"] [[BBC Sport]] Retrieved on 18 March 2008</ref>.

Hasselbaink also made appearances in five of the six matches Cardiff played to reach the [[FA Cup]] final for the first time in 81 years, which they went on to lose 1&ndash;0 to [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], where he played 70 minutes before being substituted for [[Steven Thompson (Scottish footballer)|Steve Thompson]]. At the end of the season Cardiff decided against extending his contract and he was released.

On 16 August 2008, during the 1&ndash;1 draw between [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] and [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] at Carrow Road, it was revealed that Hasselbaink had attended the game at the personal invitation of Norwich Chairman [[Roger Munby]] however on 29 August Manager [[Glenn Roeder]] revealed that Hasselbaink would not be joining the club permanently. Said Roeder: <U+201C>He only ever came here for training and people mustn't make too much of it. If I was to sign Jimmy Hasselbaink he wouldn't be here on trial or a test or anything like that - I wouldn't embarrass the man like that." Instead Hasselbaink retired from professional football.

===Post-retirement===
Hasselbaink has started training with [[Conference South]] side [[Woking F.C.|Woking]] to help keep himself fit and do some coaching as part of his preparation for taking his UEFA A licence.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wokingfc.co.uk/news/article/1826/ |title=Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink training with Woking |date=2009-12-03 |accessdate=2009-12-03 |publisher=''Woking FC''}}</ref>

==International career==
Hasselbaink made his debut for the Dutch national side at a late age.  His time as an international suffered due to fierce competition for the strikers' role, with the presence of [[Dennis Bergkamp]], [[Patrick Kluivert]], [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]], [[Pierre van Hooijdonk]] and [[Roy Makaay]], greatly limiting his opportunities. 

In 2004 Hasselbaink decided to quit the Dutch national team and no longer made himself available.  His most noteworthy accomplishment as an international was playing at the [[1998 World Cup]] in [[France]], and having started for the Netherlands in their opening game against [[Belgium]].

Hasselbaink is one of only five Dutch football players to be selected for the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] while never having played in the Dutch [[Eredivisie]]. The others [[List of Netherlands international footballers|capped players]] are [[Jordi Cruyff]], son of [[Johan Cruyff|Johan]], [[Rob Reekers]], [[Willi Lippens]] and [[Wim Hofkens]].
