'''Crist<U+00F3>bal de O<U+00F1>ate''' ([[1504]], [[Spain]]&mdash;[[October 6]], [[1567]], P<U+00E1>nuco, [[Zacatecas]]) was a Spanish explorer, conquistador and colonial official in [[New Spain]]. He is considered the founder of the contemporary city of [[Guadalajara (Jalisco)|Guadalajara]] in 1531, as well as other places in [[New Galicia]] (western New Spain).

==Background==
O<U+00F1>ate was born in 1504 in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]] or [[O<U+00F1>ate]], in the Basque country of Spain. His father was Juan P<U+00E9>rez de Narriahondo, who changed his name in later life to ''Juan de O<U+00F1>ate''. ''O<U+00F1>ate'' signifies "at the foot of the mountain pass" in the [[Basque language]]. His mother was Osana Gonz<U+00E1>lez de San Llorente. He was born into the House of Haro, whose origins go back to the Middle Ages. He was a grandson of [[Pedro de Baeza]], Se<U+00F1>or de Narrihondo, one of Spain's last feudal se<U+00F1>ores.

==Activities in New Spain==
O<U+00F1>ate arrived in New Spain as the assistant to [[Rodrigo de Albornoz]]. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] and king of Spain had made Albornoz auditor, one of five royal officials named to oversee Cort<U+00E9>s's government in the colony.

In New Spain, he was reunited with his nephews Juan de Zald<U+00ED>var O<U+00F1>ate and Vicente de Zald<U+00ED>var O<U+00F1>ate, and he contracted marriage with Catalina de Salazar, daughter of [[Gonzalo de Salazar]]. Salazar was a high-ranking official in the Royal Treasury of the colony, and at times a member of the junta that ruled New Spain.

In 1529 he was a part of the expedition of [[Nu<U+00F1>o Beltr<U+00E1>n de Guzm<U+00E1>n]] that conquered the western part of Mexico (the current states of [[Nayarit]], [[Jalisco]], [[Colima]], [[Aguascalientes]] and parts of [[Sinaloa]], [[Zacatecas]] and [[San Luis Potos<U+00ED>]]). This brutal conquest took only a few years, and the newly conquered region became known as ''[[New Galicia]]''. The foundation of the cities of [[Compostela]] and [[Tepic]] in present-day Nayarit and Guadalajara y [[Zacatecas (Zacatecas)|Zacatecas]] is attributed to O<U+00F1>ate.

In 1531 (probably January), O<U+00F1>ate founded a small town near Nochistl<U+00E1>n to which the name ''Guadalajara'' was given. Two years later Beltr<U+00E1>n de Guzm<U+00E1>n visited the city, and at the request of its inhabitants, who were fearful of Indian attacks and lacked sufficient water, he ordered it moved to [[Tonal<U+00E1>]]. This occurred on [[May 24]], [[1533]]. Later, after Beltr<U+00E1>n had returned to Spain, it was moved again, to a site near [[Tlacotan]] (northeast of modern [[Zapopan]]). This occurred probably between October 1541 and February of the following year.

During the conquest of Zacatecas rich silver mines were discovered that made Crist<U+00F3>bal de O<U+00F1>ate and his partners Diego de Ibarra and Juan de Tolosa among the richest men in New Spain. O<U+00F1>ate settled at the P<U+00E1>nuco mine in Zacatecas, where five of his six children were born. One of his sons, [[Juan de O<U+00F1>ate]], became an explorer of western North America and founder of the first European settlement on the upper [[Rio Grande]] in the present U.S. state of [[New Mexico]]. Both Juan and his twin brother [[Cris<U+00F3>bal de O<U+00F1>ate (hijo)|Crist<U+00F3>bal]] served as Spanish governors of Nuevo Mexico.

Crist<U+00F3>bal de O<U+00F1>ate (the father) served as governor of the province of New Galicia on three occasions. Besides being a conquistador, official and mineowner, he was a farmer, rancher and [[encomienda|encomendero]]. He was a benefactor of the cities he founded. He established a dynasty that retained wealth and power for 300 years.

Although he was a lieutenant of Belt<U+00E1>n de Guzm<U+00E1>n, perhaps the bloodiest conquistador in the history of New Spain, there is no evidence that O<U+00F1>ate acted with especial cruelty in the conquest of New Galicia. In the cities he founded, many streets, businesses, and geographic locations bear his name. He was said to be very generous with those who requested his aid.

O<U+00F1>ate died at his mine of P<U+00E1>nuco, Zacatecas on [[October 6]], [[1567]]. He was interred in the parochial church there.
