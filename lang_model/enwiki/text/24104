'''Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand''' ([[1609]]/[[1610]]<sup>1</sup> in [[Escorial]] near [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] - [[9 November]] [[1641]] in [[Brussels]]) (also known as '''Fernando''' and  as '''Ferdinand von <U+00D6>sterreich'''), [[Governors of the Habsburg Netherlands|Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]], [[Infante]] of [[Spain]], [[Archbishop]] of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] (1619-41), and commander during the [[Thirty Years' War]] ([[1618]]-[[1648]])

==Biography==
===Youth===
Born in [[Escorial]] near [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] in [[1609]]<sup>1</sup> as the son of [[King of Spain]], [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], brother of King of Spain [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], and [[Margaret of Austria (1584-1611)|Margaret of Austria]], sister of [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand II]]. His father wished that he make his career in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]], and hence in 1619 he was made [[Archbishop of Toledo]], and shortly afterwards received the title of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]. The style Cardinal-Infante was a combination of his title of Cardinal and his title as a Prince (''[[Infante]]'' in Spanish) of Spain. Ferdinand was never ordained as a [[Priest]], which was common enough at the time for royalty and members of the aristocracy who were placed in clerical office.{{Philippine House}}

===Events leading to the Battle of N<U+00F6>rdlingen===
In [[1630]] the Cardinal Infante's aunt [[Isabella Clara Eugenia]] planned to make him her successor as governor of the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. To move to the Netherlands in a style befitting to a governor, a strong army had to accompany him. Travel by ship from Spain was not an option, due to the superiority of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] navy.  Therefore he went to [[Genoa]] in [[1633]] to meet with an army from [[Milan]] for a planned march through [[Lombardy]], [[Tyrol]], and [[Swabia]], and then following the [[Rhine]] to the [[Netherlands]]. Ferdinand also planned to secure this supply route with a string of garrisons, and to support the army of [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|King Ferdinand of Hungary]], his uncle the emperor's son and heir, who was leading the Imperial army facing the Swedes in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Since disease delayed his travels, he sent half of his army ahead under the command of the [[G<U+00F3>mez Su<U+00E1>rez de Figueroa, duque de Feria|Duke of Feria]]. However, this army was severely depleted during fighting with the Swedish army of [[Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]] and [[Gustaf Horn]]. The Spanish requested 4000 [[cavalry]] from the Imperial general [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]], but since Wallenstein declined the request the Spanish had to fund the troops on their own. The Cardinal-Infante was able to continue his travels in [[1634]], collecting in [[Bavaria]] the remains of the Army of G<U+00F3>mez Su<U+00E1>rez, who had died in January 1634.

===Battle of N<U+00F6>rdlingen ===
(''Main article: [[Battle of N<U+00F6>rdlingen (1634)|Battle of N<U+00F6>rdlingen]]'')

Meanwhile, Ferdinand of Hungary was able to defeat the Swedish army at [[Regensburg]] in July 1634. This Ferdinand and his cousin the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand then raced to merge their armies. The Swedish forces of Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar and Gustaf Horn desperately tried to prevent this merger, but were unable to catch up with Ferdinand of Hungary. The Cardinal-Infante crossed the [[Danube]] in August [[1634]]. In September both armies were able to merge, and camped south of [[N<U+00F6>rdlingen]] in [[Swabia]]. At that time N<U+00F6>rdlingen was protected by a small Swedish garrison. Shortly thereafter, the armies of Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar and Gustaf Horn also reached N<U+00F6>rdlingen, preparing the events for the decisive [[Battle of N<U+00F6>rdlingen (1634)|Battle of N<U+00F6>rdlingen]]. The cousins Ferdinand & Ferdinand then prepared for battle, ignoring the advice of the more experienced generals, such as the Imperial general [[Matthias Gallas]]. Bernhard and Horn also prepared for battle, but they were by now rivals and in disagreement with each other. They also underestimated the numerically superior enemy forces, due to incorrect reports that did not realize the Spanish Army of the late Duke of Feria had joined the Cardinal-Infante and believed that the enemy forces numbered only 7,000, not 21,000 infantry, compared to 16,000 Swedish infantry. During the battle, almost anything that could go wrong went wrong for the Swedish forces, due to the strong deffensive efforts of the Spanish Infantry (the most feared '''''"Tercios Viejos"''''', mainly those commanded by '''Fuenclara, Idi<U+00E1>quez and Toralto''') after pushing back fifteen Swedish assaults against Blue and Yellow Horn regiments on the hill of Albuch they protected, so the two Ferdinands achieved an outstanding military victory. Gustaf Horn  was captured, the Swedish army was destroyed, and the remainder that fled to [[Heilbronn]] was only a shadow of the former glorious army. As a whole this battle proved that the deployment improvements deviced by Maurice of Orange and the late Swedish King did not macht yet the old Tercio when Spanish troops were entangled in the fighting.

===The Spanish Netherlands===
The King of Hungary tried to convince his cousin to stay and to strengthen their hold on [[Germany]], but the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand moved his troops almost immediately after the battle to continue to [[Brussels]]. At the end of [[1634]] he entered Brussels with all the glory befitting a Governor-General. Due to the unpopularity of the clergy in Brussels, he downplayed his religious status and instead emphasized his worldly ranks. Ferdinand was a skilled politician and diplomat, and quickly reformed the government and the military. He especially managed to win the support of the [[Flemings]] against [[France]]. 

However, his powers were secretly limited, and the leader of his army was instructed to follow Spanish orders instead of Ferdinand's orders if necessary. In [[1635]] the French attacked [[Namur (city)|Namur]], planning to merge with the Dutch near [[Maastricht]]. However, the Dutch hesitated, and the French retreated. Ferdinand subsequently was able to capture [[Diest]], [[Goch]], [[Gennep]], [[Limbourg]], and [[Schenk]]. 

In [[1636]] Ferdinand disempowered the last protestant priests in the Spanish Netherlands, and continued his military expansion by capturing [[Hirsen]], [[Ch<U+00E2>telet, Belgium|Ch<U+00E2>telet]], and [[Chapelle]], and securing [[Luxembourg]] using [[Croatia]]n troops.

===Fall from Grace===
[[Image:Kardinal-Infant Ferdinand von <U+00D6>sterreich.jpg|thumb|200px|Cardinale Infante Ferdinand of Austria ]]
On [[October 10]] [[1637]], however, [[Breda (Netherlands)|Breda]] was recaptured again after a 10 month siege by the [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange|Prince of Orange]] after being under Spanish control for 12 years. Despite repeated attempts the Cardinal-Infante was unable to recapture this critical fortress, strengthening not only the Dutch but also his enemies at the Spanish court in Madrid. Ferdinand also lost [[Chapelles]], [[Landrey]], and [[Damvilliers]] to the French, and was not only unable to capture [[Maubeuge]] but also lost significant ground to the French in the process. While Ferdinand was able to capture [[Antwerp]], [[Chastillon]], and [[Geldern]] in subsequent years, he lost the important town of [[Arras]] in [[1640]]. 

More dangerous than his military enemies were, however, his enemies at the Spanish court. Numerous rumors and lies floated about, and it was claimed that Ferdinand was planning to become an independent ruler of the Spanish Netherlands with the help of the French King, an enemy of Spain. This rumor was enhanced by another rumor that the French court was planning to marry Ferdinand to the daughter of the [[Duke of Orleans]], the French king's brother. Both claims were totally without merit and only designed to hurt his reputation.

At the same time, the Spanish empire was in a bad state both military and financially. The Cardinal-Infante was even giving conflicting orders to send troops to Spain to aid against a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] uprising. 

Ferdinand fell ill during battles in [[1641]], and died on [[9 November]] [[1641]] in [[Brussels]] at age 32. It is believed that the death was caused by exhaustion combined with ill health. Reports talk about an [[ulcer]] on the stomach, but continuing court rumors also claimed that he was [[poison]]ed. Before his death he also had an [[illegitimate]] daughter, Marie Anne de la Croix, who became a [[nun]]. She was born in Brussels 1641 and died in Madrid [[1715]].

His body was brought to Spain in [[1643]], and a total of 12,000 [[requiem]]s were performed in accordance with his last wishes.

Disputes about who should be his successor as the Governor-General of the Spanish Netherlands also destroyed the alliance between the Emperor in [[Vienna]] and the Spanish in Madrid.  The Emperor (by now the Cardinal-Infante's old comrade in arms, Ferdinand III) favored his brother [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria]], a militarily unfortunate but otherwise capable leader. Madrid however favored [[John of Austria the Younger]], the twelve year old [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate]] son of King [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] and the famous actress [[Mar<U+00ED>a Calder<U+00F3>n]]. The [[inauguration]] of the unpopular bastard was delayed, and Spain lost control of much of the Spanish Netherlands in the following years due to the flawed rule of the interim governor [[Francisco de Mello, Marquis of Terceira]].
