During the Sir Reginald Kell period, successful participants had to have a pint in each of eight pubs in and close to either end of King Street; ladies were allowed halves or shorts; drinks could not be set up in advance and if you met a friend you were honour bound to have a chat with them. At the time the run was not a race and entrants had two hours to complete the run. The rule at this time was that every time any participant had a pee or was sick they had to go back a pub and have an additional pint. The club tie for a "clean" run is as shown in the photo. However at this time a white capital P was embroidered on the tie under the beer mug for every pee prior to completion (and hence additional beer consumed in completing the run). Similarly a golden capital P was added to the tie for every puke. Many years later the King Street Run provided the inspiration for the start of the annual Hilton Harriers Hick and Hurl Christmas Social/Charity Run in South Africa. The Sir Reginald Kell era of the run (which definitely included 1978/1979) must have been short-lived as it has also been reported that the [[Cantabrigensis Hash House Harriers]] resurrected the run in 1982,<ref>{{cite web
