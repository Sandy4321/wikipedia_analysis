[[File:Jan van Balen Allegory of Hearing.jpg|thumb|left|''Allegory of Hearing'']]
He was the son of [[Hendrik van Balen]], brother of [[Hendrick van Balen the Younger]] and brother-in-law to [[Theodoor van Thulden]].<ref name=RKD>[http://www.rkd.nl/rkddb/dispatcher.aspx?action=search&database=ChoiceArtists&search=priref=4019 Jan van Balen] in the [[RKD]]</ref> and was instructed by his father. After having made considerable progress in the art, his father sent him to Italy, where he had himself derived such advantage from his studies. He remained some years in Rome, and may have attached himself to the works of [[Francesco Albani]], whose style he imitated. In each of his pictures, the style of his country is discernible; although his colouring and pencil are considered excellent, he was inattentive to the correctness of his outline. He generally painted cabinet pictures, although he sometimes attempted larger works, in which he was less successful. He had two brothers, [[Gaspar van Balen|Gaspar]] (born in 1615)<ref>[http://www.rkd.nl/rkddb/dispatcher.aspx?action=search&database=ChoiceArtists&search=priref=4014 Gaspard van Balen] in the [[RKD]]</ref> and [[Hendrik van Balen II|Hendrik]] (born in 1620),<ref>[http://www.rkd.nl/rkddb/dispatcher.aspx?action=search&database=ChoiceArtists&search=priref=232299 Hendrick van Balen II] in the [[RKD]]</ref> who were both painters.

He is believed to have returned to Antwerp in 1642, though according to the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] he returned earlier than that, because in 1635-1639 he collaborated with his brother Gaspard, Theodoor van Thulden, Jan de Labare and [[Erasmus Quellinus II]] on prints for the [[Royal Entry]] or ''Pompa Introitus'' of the [[Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand]] into Antwerp in 1635, published by Gaspar Gevartius under the direction of [[Rubens]].<ref name=RKD />

He died in Antwerp in 1654. He is buried in the [[St. James' Church, Antwerp]].<ref name=RKD />
