'''''Storage Wars''''' is an American [[reality television]] series on the [[A&E Network]] that premiered in December 2010.

The show features the auctioneering couple of [[Dan Dotson]] and Laura Dotson, as well as buyers: Barry Weiss, the usually together but occasionally separated team of Darrell and Brandon Sheets, the team of Jarrod Schulz and Brandi Passante, and Dave Hester. Executive producer and creator [[Thom Beers]] serves as off-screen narrator.

When rent is not paid on a [[storage locker]] for three months in [[California]], the contents can be sold by an [[auctioneer]] as a single lot of items in the form of a cash-only auction.{{cn|date=September 2013}}  The show follows professional buyers who purchase the contents based only on a five-minute inspection of what they can see from the door when it is open. The goal is to turn a profit on the merchandise.

==Concerns about authenticity==
While some have speculated that some of the units have been stocked by producers,<ref name="USAToday">{{cite news |url= http://www.usatoday.com/LIFE/usaedition/2011-01-28-storage28_CV_U.htm |title='Storage Wars' strikes it rich|first= Marco R.|last= della Cava|work=[[USA Today]] |date= January 27, 2011|publisher=[[Gannett Company|Gannett]] |location=[[McLean, VA]] |issn=0734-7456 |quote= |accessdate=July 17, 2011}}</ref> an A&E publicist said; "There is no staging involved.

===Lawsuits===
In December 2012, Dave Hester filed a lawsuit against A&E and [[Original Productions]], claiming that the producers staged entire units, planted items in lockers after having them appraised weeks in advance, and funneled cash to weaker teams to buy lockers they could not have otherwise afforded. The suit claims that Hester and other cast members met with network officials to express concerns that those actions were in violation of federal law<ref>Per the 1960 amendments to the [[Communications Act of 1934|Communications act]] passed following the [[quiz show scandals]]. See [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/usc_sec_47_00000509----000-.html 47 U.S.C. <U+00A7>509] and associated legislative history.</ref> intended to prevent viewers from being deceived when watching a show involving intellectual skills.<ref name=RadarOnline>{{cite web| url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/12/storage-wars-sued-dave-hester-show-faked | title=Storage Wars Sued By Its Star; Show Is Faked And Execs Were Confronted By Cast, Court Papers Charge|first= David|last= Perel|work=radaronline.com|date=December 11, 2012 |accessdate=December 11, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=WFP>{{cite web|url= http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/aes-storage-wars-reality-series-is-rigged-fired-cast-member-claims-in-lawsuit-183050181.html|title= A&E's 'Storage Wars' reality series is rigged, fired cast member claims in lawsuit|work=winnipegfreepress.com|date= December 11, 2012|accessdate= December 11, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.yahoo.com/lawsuit-claims-es-storage-wars-show-rigged-211515226.html |title=Lawsuit claims A&E's 'Storage Wars' show is rigged  |agency=Associated Press |date=December 11, 2012 }}</ref>

In January 2013, A&E responded by stating that its composition of the show is covered by the [[First Amendment]], and that Hester's claims do not apply; the network also said the Communications Act of 1934 is inapplicable to cable television, which did not exist in 1934, and that the format of ''Storage Wars'' involves no "chance", "intellectual knowledge" or "intellectual skill" and so is not a game show. A&E also stated that there are "notable inconsistencies in [Hester's] exaggerated self-portrait", referring to his claims of value on the items he finds in lockers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/ae-respondssort-ofto-claims-that-storage-wars-is-f,91728/ | title=A&E responds (sort of) to claims that Storage Wars is fake|first=Marah|last=Eakin|date=January 29, 2013|accessdate=February 2013}}</ref>

In March 2013, A&E won a partial victory in the suit when a federal judge tossed out Hester's claim of unfair business practices, calling the show "expressive free speech", and stated that his claim of wrongful termination was not specific enough.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/pop2it/2013/03/storage-wars-lawsuit-aes-partial-victory-against-dave-hester.html | title = 'Storage Wars' lawsuit: A&E's partial victory against Dave Hester | first = Chris | last = Hayner | work = Zap2It | date = March 13, 2013 | accessdate = March 19, 2013}}</ref>

In July 2013, Hester's lawsuit was ruled in favor of A&E and Original Productions. Hester was ordered to pay $122,262 in legal fees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/blog/2013/07/14/Dave-Hester-hit-with-122K-in-legal-fees/7281373816903/ |title=Dave Hester, ex-Storage Wars star, loses legal battle with A&E |publisher=UPI.com |date=2013-07-14 |accessdate=2013-09-07}}</ref>

==Opening titles==
{{Original research|section|date=September 2013}}
Every episode opens with the narrator, Thom Beers, setting the basic premise for the series: "When storage units are abandoned, the treasures within are put up for auction". In Episodes 2, 3, 4 and 7 of season one, an extra line was added to the opening narration: "because in this high-stakes game, it's get rich or die buyin'". The narration is followed by the preview of the upcoming episode, followed by the opening titles. In the opening titles, the sequence of titles begins at Dave, then Darrell, then Brandi and Jarrod, then Barry, and finally at Dan and Laura. While Laura always appeared in the opening titles, her highlighted face and name were not added to the credits until episode 11 of Season 1. Dave Hester Jr. and Brandon Sheets also appear in the opening titles, but are not highlighted and credited. The show's theme song, "Money Owns This Town", which was written and recorded specifically for the show, plays during the opening. As of Season Four, Dave Hester has been removed from the opening credits.
