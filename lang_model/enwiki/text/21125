'''Skipper Thomas Crisp [[Victoria Cross|VC]], [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|DSC]], [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNR]]''' ([[April 28]], [[1876]] - [[August 15]], [[1917]]) was a posthumous [[England|English]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] military service personnel. He earned his award during the defence of his vessel, the armed naval [[Smack (ship)|smack]] HMS ''Nelson'', in the [[North Sea]] against an attack by the German [[submarine]] [[Unterseeboot C-41]] in 1917.<ref name="UC-41"> The identity of the submarine involved in this incident cannot be positively ascertained, but the UC-41 was both in the area at the time and sunk shortly afterwards. No surviving German submarines reported the incident in their logs.</ref>

Thomas Crisp's self-sacrifice in the face of this "unequal struggle" was used by the government to bolster morale during some of the toughest days of the [[First World War]] for Britain, the summer and autumn of 1917, during which Britain was the most active Allied participant and was suffering [[Battle of Passchendaele|consequent losses]].<ref name="P175"/> His exploit was read aloud by [[David Lloyd George]] in the [[Houses of Parliament]] and made headline news for nearly a week. 

==Early life==
Thomas Crisp was born into a family of shipwrights and fishermen in [[Lowestoft]], one of seven children to William and Mary Anne Crisp. Although his father was the owner of a successful boatbuilding firm and thus could afford a high quality education for his children, Thomas showed no sign of enjoying his studies, instead showing a "marked preference for quayside adventure to school routine".<ref name="P180"> P.180, ''The Naval VCs'', Stephen Snelling </ref> Upon leaving school, Thomas took to the sea, spending several years as a herring fisherman before joining a [[trawler]] out of Lowestoft. He was a natural to the work, being a remarkably good sailor, but tired of it quickly and joined the Atlantic steamship SS ''Mobile'', rising to become her quartermaster and making several trans-Atlantic voyages in her.<ref name="P180"/>

In 1895, aged 19, his wanderings ended when he met and married Harriet Elizabeth Alp and settled with her in [[Burgh St. Peter]] near Lowestoft where they had two sons and a daughter, including Thomas Crisp Jr., who would be by his father's side on the day he won the Victoria Cross. Establishing himself as a fisherman in the town, Thomas Sr. soon achieved his mate and then skipper qualifications entitling him to captain a fishing vessel from the port. In 1902 he was taken on by Chambers, one of the largest boat owning families in Lowestoft, to crew and then captain their [[ketch]] ''George Borrow'', in which he remained for thirteen years. In 1907 the family moved to Lowestoft while Crisp continued his work at sea, proving one of the most popular fishing captains in Lowestoft and being joined by his son in 1913.<ref name="P181"> P.181, ''The Naval VCs'', Stephen Snelling </ref>

When war was declared in July 1914, Crisp was at sea, and remained there for several days, discovering to his surprise on his return that enemy submarines were expected off the port at any moment. When this threat failed to materialise, Thomas Crisp returned to the sea, being too old for military service and in an occupation vital to the food supplies of the nation. In late September, the ''George Borrow'' passed the [[HMS Aboukir (1900)|HMS ''Aboukir'']], [[HMS Hogue (1900)|HMS ''Hogue'']] and [[HMS Cressy (1899)|HMS ''Cressy'']] just hours before they were all sunk with over a thousand lives by German submarine [[Unterseeboot 9|U-9]]. Tom Crisp Jr. later wrote of finding bodies in their fishing nets for weeks afterwards.<ref name="P182"> P.182, ''The Naval VCs'', Stephen Snelling </ref>

==War service==
In the spring of 1915, Tom Crisp Jr. left the vessel to join the navy and just weeks later the U-boat threat expected so many months before finally arrived as submarines surfaced amongst the undefended fishing fleets and used dynamite to destroy dozens of them after releasing the crews. This offensive was part of a wider German strategy to denude Britain of food supplies and it took a heavy toll on the fishing fleets of the North Sea. ''George Borrow'' was among the victims, being sunk in August, although it is not known if Crisp was aboard at the time.<ref name="P182"/> Whilst temporarily working in a net factory following this setback, he was scouted by a Navy officer recruiting experienced local fishing captains to command a flotilla of tiny fishing vessels which were to be secretly armed. The boats were intended to be working fishing vessels fitted with a small artillery piece with which to sink the enemy submarines as they surfaced alongside. In this manner it was hoped they would protect the fishing fleets without the diversion of major resources from the regular fleet, in the same manner as [[Q-ships]] deployed in the commercial sea lanes.<ref name="SRO">[http://www.senseofplacesuffolk.co.uk/learning_resources/det_thomas_crisp.pdf Sea Heroes, Thomas Crisp VC, DSC, Hero of the Q-Ships, Suffolk Records Office], Retrieved on the [[28 January]] [[2007]] </ref>

Eagerly agreeing to this proposal, Crisp became first a Seaman and by the summer of 1916 a Skipper in the [[Royal Naval Reserve]], pulling strings to get his son on board his boat, the HM Armed Smack ''I'll Try'', which was armed with a 3-pounder gun. On the [[1 February]] [[1917]] in the North Sea, ''I'll Try'' had its first confrontation with the enemy when two submarines surfaced close to the smack and her companion the larger ''Boy Alfred''. Despite near misses from enemy torpedoes, both smacks scored hits on their larger opponents and reported them as probable sinkings, although post-war German records show that no submarines were lost on that date.<ref name="P183"> P.183, ''The Naval VCs'', Stephen Snelling </ref> Both skippers were awarded the Distinguished Service Crossand a present of <U+00A3>200 for this action, and Crisp was offered a promotion and transfer to an ocean-going Q-ship.<ref>[http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/archiveViewFrameSetup.asp?webType=0&PageDuplicate=n%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&issueNumber=29997&pageNumber=0&SearchFor=thomas%20crisp&selMedalType=&selHonourType= The London Gazette citation for the DSC, 23rd March 1917], Retrieved on the [[22 January]] [[2007]] </ref> He was sadly forced to turn down this offer due to his wife's sudden and terminal illness which claimed her in June 1917, shortly before her husband's own death.

==Victoria Cross action==

In July, ''I'll Try'' became ''Nelson'' and ''Boy Alfred'' became the ''Ethel & Millie'' in an effort to maintain their cover. The boats continued to operate together and Crisp's crew was augmented with two regular seamen and a [[Royal Marine]] rifleman, giving the ''Nelson''  a crew of ten, including Crisp and his son. The smacks set out as usual on the [[15 August]] and pulled in a catch during the morning before making a sweep near the Jim Howe Bank in search of cruising enemies. At 2.30 pm, Crisp and the UC-41 spotted each other at 6,000&nbsp;yards at the same time, and both began firing at once, the submarine's weapon scoring several hits before the ''Nelson's'' could be brought to bear. By this stage in the war, German submarine captains were more aware of the decoy ship tactics and no longer stopped British merchant shipping, preferring to sink them from a distance with gunfire.<ref name="SRO"/>

With such a heavy disparity in armament between the smack's 3 pounder and the submarine's 88mm deck gun the engagement was short lived, the submarine firing eight shots before the the ''Nelson'' could get within range of her opponent.<ref>[http://uboat.net/wwi/types/index.html?type=UC+II Type UC II coastal minelayers class at the Uboat.net database], Retrieved on the [[2 February]] [[2007]]</ref> The fourth shot fired from the UC-41 holed the smack, and the seventh tore off both of Crisp's legs from underneath him. Calling for the confidential papers to be thrown overboard, Crisp dictated a message to be sent by the boat's four [[carrier pigeons]]:<ref>Like many small ships of the era, the ''Nelson'' did not possess a radio set. Sources dispute the number of carrier pigeons carried by the ''Nelson''; Snelling states that four were released of which one reached home in good time, whilst the Suffolk Records Office claim that only one was carried aboard.</ref>

The sinking smack was abandoned by the nine unwounded crew, who attempted to remove their captain, only to be ordered by Crisp that he should be thrown overboard rather than slow them down. The crew refused to do so, but found they were unable to move him and so left him where he lay. He died in his son's arms as Tom Crisp Jr. knelt beside him to say goodbye.<ref name="P178"> P.178, ''The Naval VCs'', Stephen Snelling </ref> It is said that he was smiling as he died and remained so as the ship sank underneath him.<ref> P.305, ''Symbol of Courage'', Max Arthur</ref> The ''Ethel & Millie'' meanwhile had just arrived on the scene as the ''Nelson'' sank, and her captain Skipper Charles Manningcalled for the lifeboat to come alongside.<ref> [http://www.cwgc.org/search/casualty_details.aspx?casualty=3053196 Commonwealth War Graves database page for Skipper Charles William Manning], Retrieved on the [[22 January]] [[2007]] </ref> Realising that this would greatly overcrowd the second boat, the survivors refused and Manning sailed onwards towards the submarine, coming under lethal fire as he did so causing his vessel too to take on water and begin to sink.

The crew of the sinking ''Ethel & Millie'' then abandoned their battered boat and were hauled aboard the UC-41, where the ''Nelson'' survivors last saw them standing in line being addressed by a German officer. The seven British sailors of the ''Ethel & Millie'' were never seen again, and much controversy exists surrounding their disappearance. Prevailing opinion at the time was that they had been murdered and dumped overboard by the German crew or abandoned at sea without supplies, but these scenarios seem unlikely and it is more probable that they were taken prisoner aboard the boat and killed when the UC-41 was herself sunk on the [[21 August]] [[1917]] by armed trawlers.<ref>[http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=UC%2041 UC 41 page on the Uboat.net directory], Retrieved on the [[22 January]] [[2007]]</ref> <ref name="P180"/> Indeed, the son of Arthur Soanes,<ref> [http://www.cwgc.org/search/casualty_details.aspx?casualty=3053650 Commonwealth War Graves database page for Deck Hand Arthur Soanes], Retrieved on the [[22 January]] [[2007]] </ref> one of the victims of this incident, later claimed to have contacted his father through his powers as a [[spiritual medium]] and reported this version of events as fact.<ref name="P180"/>

The survivors of the ''Nelson'' drifted for nearly two days until they arrived at the Jim Howe Buoy, where they were discovered by the fishery protection vessel ''Dryad'' and rescued. A pigeon named "Red Cock" had reached the authorities in Lowestoft and had thus forewarned of the fate of the boats and caused the ''Dryad'' to be despatched to search for survivors.<ref name="SRO"/> Following their rescue, the whole of ''Nelson'''s crew were extensively debriefed following medical treatment for exposure and minor injuries and thus revealed the story of the uneven action. A court of enquiry praised the surviving crew and their dead captain and authorised the award of the Victoria Cross posthumously to Thomas Crisp and [[Distinguished Service Medal (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Medals]] to his son and another member of the crew. On the [[29 October]] [[1917]], David Lloyd George made an inspirational speech in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] citing Crisp's sacrifice as representative of the Royal Navy's commitment "from the icy waters of the Arctic Ocean to the stormy floods of Magellan", which promoted Crisp into an overnight celebrity whose story ran in all the major London papers for nearly a week, containing as it did a verifiable story of personal sacrifice, filial devotion and [[Anti-German sentiment#World War I|perceived German barbarity]].<ref name="P175"> P.175, ''The Naval VCs'', Stephen Snelling </ref> The medal presentation was made to Tom Crisp Jr. at [[Buckingham Palace]] on the [[19 December]] [[1917]], shortly before he was promoted to Skipper in his own right.

On the 15th August, 1917, the Smack "Nelson" was engaged in fishing when she was attacked with gunfire from an enemy submarine. The gear was let go and the submarine's fire was returned. The submarine's fourth shot went through the port bow just below the water line and the seventh shell struck the skipper, partially disembowelling [sic] him, and passed through the deck and out through the side of the ship. In spite of the terrible nature of his wound Skipper Crisp retained consciousness, and his first thought was to send off a message that he was being attacked and giving his position. He continued to command his ship until the ammunition was almost exhausted and the smack was sinking. He refused to be moved into the small boat when the rest of the crew were obliged to abandon the vessel as she sank, his last request being that he might be thrown overboard.<br>

==Post-war remembrance==
After the war, a small display to the memory of Thomas Crisp Sr. was set up in Lowestoft free library and another in the local maritime museum. The former contained a specially commissioned painting and parts of the sunken ''Nelson'' which were dredged up years later. This display was destroyed during the [[Second World War]] when the building was gutted in [[the Blitz]]. A new display featuring a replica of the Victoria Cross awarded to Tom Crisp currently stands in Lowestoft town hall. The original is held secure by the local council after the family of Skipper Crisp felt his interests would not be served if the medal were held privately. It can be viewed on request of Waveney District Council's Chief Executive.<ref>[http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/ccwavene.htm www.victoriacross.org.uk, Waveney District Council page], Retrieved on the [[28 January]] [[2007]]</ref> Thomas Crisp's name is inscribed on the [[Chatham Naval Memorial]] for those lost at sea during the First World War,<ref>[http://www.cwgc.org/search/casualty_details.aspx?casualty=3052474 Commonwealth War Graves database page for Skipper Thomas Crisp], Retrieved on the [[22 January]] [[2007]] </ref> as well as two church memorials in Lowestoft to the town's war dead, St. John's and St. Margaret's.<ref> [http://www.roll-of-honour.com/Suffolk/LowestoftStJohnsChurch.html www.roll-of-honour.com, Lowestoft, St. John's Church War Memorial], Retrieved on the [[28 January]] [[2007]] </ref> The latter church also contains a "VC Bell" dedicated to Thomas Crisp's memory.<ref> [http://www.roll-of-honour.com/Suffolk/LowestoftStMargaretsChurch.html www.roll-of-honour.com, Lowestoft, St. Maragret's Church War Memorial], Retrieved on the [[28 January]] [[2007]] </ref>

In a footnote to the action, the pigeon "Red Cock" which brought news of the engagement to the authorities was stuffed upon his death and was mounted in the Thomas Crisp display at Lowestoft town hall for many years before being reportedly relocated to a museum in [[South Kensington]].<ref name="SRO"/>
