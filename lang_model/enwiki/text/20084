'''Team Young NTUC (TYN)''' is the social arm of [[Young NTUC]] the official youth wing of the [[National Trades Union Congress]] (NTUC) in [[Singapore]]. It consists of several affinity groups that are made up of young adults aged 35 and below. These affinity groups are self-initiated and self-managed by the young adults.

[[Affinity groups]] are small groups of activists who work together on a common interest.

==Objectives of TYN==
TYN affinity groups give members an opportunity to pursue their varied interests. A broad range of interests from photography to dragon boating are represented by TYN affinity groups. Trainings and courses based on the relevant interests are organized regularly for members to continually develop their skills.

TYN affinity groups also aim to contribute back to society through active volunteerism. Tapping on their skills and passions, TYN affinity groups volunteer at least once a month with organizations that champion their cause. From animal welfare to caring for the elderly, TYN affinity groups are making difference in the community.

===TYN 20/20 (Photography)===
20/20 is a photography interest group which allows like-minded individuals a platform to learn and share. The group welcomes anyone with an interest in photography with events ranging from amateur photography courses to photo exhibitions. Courses are taught by professional photographers and cater to all levels.

Some noteworthy events organized by 20/20 so far include an overseas photography trip and a national photo exhibition. The Team made its way to George Town, Penang in 2010 to visit picturesque sites and meet local photographers to share their tips and love for photography.

In 2011, 20/20 held its largest event thus far: a photo exhibition at the National Geographic Store entitled <U+201C>NUDE: Dignity from Within<U+201D>. The exhibition showcased the labor force and featured Singaporeans from all walks of life.

===TYN 350 Singapore===
350 Singapore <ref>http://www.facebook.com/pages/350-Singapore/123943510954166</ref> is an affinity group with an environmentalism cause. The group desires to raise local awareness for the global 350 movement which aims to reduce carbon emissions to the upper safety limit of 350 ppm (parts per million). 350 Singapore hosts many events such as [[Earth Hour]] with [[Young NTUC]] and 350 on the Streets where volunteers took to the streets to encourage members of the public to pledge to do their part for the environment.

The most significant of 350 Singapore<U+2019>s events would be Run 350.<ref>http://www.facebook.com/pages/RUN-350/244642285628</ref> Since its inauguration in 2010, Run 350 has been held annually to raise awareness for the global 350 movement as well as to reforest Singapore by using funds raised to plant trees through the Garden City Fund<U+2019>s Plant-a-Tree program. In 2011, a staggering 7200 participants took part in the race held at the Marina Bay area.

===TYN Black Eight (American Pool)===
Black Eight was established to gather pool enthusiasts in [[Young NTUC]] and welcomes players of all calibers. The team trains almost weekly at Klassic Pool Hall on Saturdays from 10am-12pm where those who are relatively new at the sport can pick up skills from the more experienced. Those who wish to pursue the sport competitively would find that Black Eight provides plenty of opportunities to do so in both local and regional tournaments like the Johor Bahru 9 Ball Tournament in 2010; enabling the team to go up against and learn from the very best in the region.

The team also conducts monthly internal tournaments which allow all members a chance to play competitively as well as to promote interaction between members. Some of Black Eight<U+2019>s recent accolades include winning the Cuesports 9 Ball Team Challenge and the USports 9 Ball Pool Tournament in 2010.

===TYN Dragonboat===
TYN Dragonboat was formed in 2007 for enthusiastic paddlers to meet like-minded people and train together. No prior experience is needed to join the team which trains under a professional coach every Saturday from 2-4pm at the Kallang Water Sports Centre.

TYN Dragonboat not only allows members to improve their skills through regular training and interaction with other professionals but also provides a platform for members to compete in the sport competitively. The team has been greatly successful in recent tournaments, coming in Champions in the Singapore Dragon Boat Festival and Gallop of the Dragons Union Challenge in 2010 among others.

===TYN p.L.a.Y (Performing Arts)===
Performing with Love by Active Youth, better known as TYN p.&nbsp;L.aY, is a group of performing arts enthusiasts hailing from different age groups. Members come together to share their love for the performing arts through rigorous workshops and rehearsals for events. Many are promising young talents who had to go through auditions to become a part of p.&nbsp;L.a.Y.  These dedicated performers seek out opportunities to perform for charity events as well as NTUC events. Having to commit 2<U+2013>3 days of rehearsal a week does not deter these committed members although some of them are young adults holding full-time jobs.

Some of p.&nbsp;L.aY<U+2019>s works include <U+201C>A Labour of Love<U+201D>, Young NTUC<U+2019>s first production, a musical dedicated to appreciating past and present union leaders and the 2011 May Day Rally performance.

ACRES is an organization that was founded in 2001 with a mission to create a caring and socially responsible society for animals.

TYN Wildlife volunteers spend their time attending workshops on wildlife care and volunteering at the ACRES Wildlife Rescue Centre in Jalan Lekar. In 2010, volunteers toiled over many weekends to construct a cement base around fence lines to improve animal living conditions. The team received a certificate of appreciation from ACRES Executive Director in recognition of their contribution to ACRES.
