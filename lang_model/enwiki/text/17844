The '''Alliance of Germans, Party for Unity, Peace and Freedom''' &ndash; in German: '''Bund der Deutschen, Partei f<U+00FC>r Einheit, Frieden und Freiheit''' ('''BdD''') &ndash; was a political party in the [[Federal Republic of Germany]].

==Origins of the BdD and its program until the foundation of the German Peace Union==

The BdD resulted from the opposition movement to [[Konrad Adenauer]]'s policies of Western integration. After signing of the general agreement on June 26, 1952, the ''German Union'' (''Deutsche Sammlung'') was founded in [[Dortmund]]. Members of the presidium were the former state chancellor [[Joseph Wirth]] (CDU), [[Katharina von Kardorff-Oheimb]] and [[Wilhelm Elfes]] (also former CDU member). The ''Deutsche Sammlung'' called for an opposition to the Western integration and demanded that every opportunity for [[German re-unification]] should be used. 

The foundation of the BdD followed the initiative of the [[politbureau]]  of the [[Socialist Unity Party]] of East Germany. Despite the fact that '[[bourgeois]]' politicians like [[Joseph Wirth]], [[Wilhelm Elfes]] made up the leadership, the party organisation and finances were in firm control of [[communist]] functionaries. The goal of the [[SED]] was to form a so-called [[National front]] of bourgeois and <U+201E>national<U+201C> forces (<U+201D>national-gesinnte<U+201D>), similar to the communist-controlled 'National Front' in East Germany. 

The core program of the BdD was a policy of [[neutrality]] as well as opposition to the re-armament of West Germany and the Western integration. Unlike [[Konrad Adenauer]]'s policies, an understanding/a compromise with the [[USSR]] was sought.

Though the BdD tried to advance economic and social demands of the middle classes and the peasants, it also sought socialisation of the large industrial enterprises. In 1956 the [[Communist Party of Germany]] was forbidden just like re-foundation of possible communist successor parties. Therefor, in the late 1950s, the BdD started to act increasingly as a substitute (''Ersatzorganisation'') for West German communists.

==The BdD as a component of the DFU==

With the foundation of the ''[[German Peace Union]]'' (''Deutsche Friedensunion'') the [[SED]] preferred to fuse the BdD with the newly founded [[GDR]]-sponsored organisation DFU. The constitutional court of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] thus classified the BdD in [[1964]] as a cadre organisation of the DFU. In effect the BdD &ndash;despite continued existence of its own organisation &ndash; no longer took part in elections but rather delegated its candidates to the DFU list. On 2. November 1968 the [[German Communist Party]]<ref>the (re-)foundation of an openly communist political party had become possible in the course of changes in the West German society during the late 1960s</ref>, DFU, BdD and other leftist groupings formed a common list, the ''Democratic Progress Action'' (''Aktion Demokratischer Fortschritt'') for the Bundestag election of 1969. The number of BdD members had fallen (according to SED records) from  12,000 (1953/1955) to less than 3,000 (1965).

The BdD was never officially disbanded but it fused ''[[de facto]]'' after its last party conference in 1968 with the DFU. The last chairman of the party was [[Josef Weber]] (chairman since 1964; previously general secretary of the BdD and later a DFU and ADF functionary).

==Media==

In 1953, the ''Deutsche Volkszeitung'' was founded as a BdD-close body. The weekly ''Freitag'', still published today, was the indirect successor to that newspaper.
