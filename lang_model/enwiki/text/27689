==Works==
In March 2000, Tayler coauthored with Ross Phillips and Tay Kratzer the guidebook ''Administering GroupWise 5.5'', written to assist [[system administrator]]s in managing Novell's [[GroupWise]]. 

Tayler's most well-known work is his webcomic, ''[[Schlock Mercenary]]'', a comedic [[webcomic]] which follows the tribulations of a star-travelling [[mercenary]] company in a satiric, mildly [[dystopia]]n 31st-century [[space opera]] setting. The story primarily centers on [[List of Schlock Mercenary characters#Captain Kaff Tagon|Captain Kaff Tagon]] and his mercenary crew, Tagon's Toughs. Members of the crew include resident mad scientist and munitions commander [[List of Schlock Mercenary characters#Captain Kevyn Andreyasn (Retired)/Munitions Commander Kevyn Andreyasn (Active Duty)|Kevyn Andreyasn]], the title [[Schlock Mercenary characters#Amorphs|carbosillicate amorph]] [[List of Schlock Mercenary characters#Sergeant Schlock|Sergeant Schlock]], former artificial intelligence [[List of Schlock Mercenary characters#Post-Dated Check Loan (or "Petey")|Petey]], and the wry [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] and former [[boyband]], [[List of Schlock Mercenary characters#Adjutant Ennesby|Ennesby]].

Many plotlines revolve around the jobs Tagon and his crew have accepted. Other times, the crew is swept up in a galaxy- or universe-spanning conflict. Since its debut on June 12, 2000 the comic has updated daily, begun to [[List of self-sufficient webcomics|support its author]],<ref name="daily-cartoonist"/> and been nominated for two [[Hugo Award]]s.<ref name="hugonom2009"/><ref name="hugonom2010"/>

The 15-minute 'cast has been running weekly since that time, and has featured a number of notable guests including [[Steve Jackson]], [[Phil Foglio]], [[Brandon Mull]], [[Tracy Hickman]], and [[Patrick Rothfuss]].<ref name="writing-excuses"/>

Along with best-selling fantasy author [[Tracy Hickman]] and his son, [[Curtis Hickman|Curtis]], he illustrated and published ''XDM X-Treme Dungeon Mastery'', a guide for [[gamemaster]]s who want to focus more on the fun aspects of [[roleplaying game]]s rather than the mechanics of counting everything.<ref name="roleplaying-pro">{{cite web|url=http://www.roleplayingpro.com/2009/07/16/xdm-x-treme-dungeon-mastery-a-dms-review/|title=XDM X-Treme Dungeon Mastery: A DM<U+2019>s Review|date=July 16, 2009|first=John|last=Lewis|publisher=Roleplaying Pro|accessdate=April 21, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5p9L1dsOQ|archivedate=April 21, 2010}}</ref>
