'''''Bronenosets''''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0411><U+0440><U+043E><U+043D><U+0435><U+043D><U+043E><U+0441><U+0435><U+0446>}}) was a {{sclass-|Uragan|monitor|3|warship}} built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in the mid-1860s. The design was based on the American {{sclass-|Passaic|monitor|2}}, but was modified to suit Russian engines, guns and construction techniques. The ship was only active when the [[Gulf of Finland]] was not frozen, but very little is known about her service. She was stricken in 1900, converted into a coal [[barge]] in 1903 and renamed ''Barzha No. 324''. The ship was lost in a storm sometime during [[World War I]].

==Description==
''Bronenosets'' was {{convert|201|ft|m|1}} long [[length overall|overall]], with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|46|ft|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|10.16|-|10.84|ft|m|1}}. She displaced {{convert|1500|-|1600|LT|t}} and her crew numbered eight officers and 88 enlisted men in 1865. They numbered 10 officers and 100 crewmen in 1877<ref name=m3>McLaughlin, p. 103</ref>

The ship was fitted with a two-cylinder [[Marine_steam_engine#Direct acting|horizontal direct-acting steam engine]]<ref name=m3/> built by [[Carr and MacPherson]] of [[Saint Petersburg]].<ref name=m7>McLaughlin, p. 107</ref> It drove a single four-bladed propeller<ref>McLaughlin, p. 106</ref> using steam that was provided by two rectangular [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s.<ref>Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 175</ref> Specific information on the output of the ship's engine has not survived, but it ranged between {{convert|340|-|500|ihp|0|lk=in}} for all the ships of this [[ship class|class]]. During ''Bronenosets''{{'}}s [[sea trial]]s on 21 October 1864, she reached a maximum speed of {{convert|7.75|kn|lk=in}} and she was the fastest ship in the class. The ship carried a maximum of {{convert|190|LT|t}} of coal, which gave her a theoretical endurance of {{convert|1440|nmi|lk=in|abbr=on}} at {{convert|6|kn}}.<ref name=m7/>

''Bronenosets'' was designed to be armed with a pair of {{convert|9|in|adj=on|0}} [[smoothbore]] [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading guns]] purchased from [[Krupp]] of Germany and [[Rifling|rifled]] in Russia, but the rifling project was seriously delayed and the ship was completed with nine-inch smoothbores. These lacked the penetration power necessary to deal with ironclads and they were replaced by license-built {{convert|15|in|adj=on}} smoothbore muzzle-loading [[Rodman gun]]s in 1867<U+2013>68. The Rodman guns were replaced around 1876 with the originally intended nine-inch rifled guns.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 104<U+2013>05</ref>

All of the wrought-iron armor that was used in the ''Uragan''-class monitors was in {{convert|1|in|0|adj=on}} plates, just as in the ''Passaic''-class ships. The side of the ship was entirely covered with three to five layers of armor plates, of which the three innermost plates extended {{convert|42|in|m|1}} below the [[waterline]]. This armor was backed by wooden beam that had a maximum thickness of {{convert|36|in|0}}. The [[gun turret]] was protected by eleven layers of armor and the [[pilothouse]] above it had eight layers of armor. Curved plates six layers thick protected the base of the [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] up to a height of {{convert|7|ft|m|1}} above the deck. Unlike their predecessors, the ''Uragan''s were built without deck armor to save weight, but ''Bronenosets'' had {{convert|0.5|in|1|adj=on}} plates added after completion.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 105<U+2013>06</ref>

==Career==
Construction of the ship began on 17 June 1863 at the [[Carr and MacPherson]] Shipyard in [[Saint Petersburg]]. ''Bronenosets'' was [[Keel|laid down]] on 24 December 1863 and she was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 24 March 1864. She entered service on 6 June 1865 and cost a total of 1,148,000 [[ruble]]s, almost double her contract cost of 600,000 rubles. The ship was assigned to the Baltic Fleet upon completion and she, and all of her [[sister ship]]s except {{ship|Russian monitor|Latnik||2}}, made a port visit to [[Stockholm]], Sweden in July<U+2013>August 1865 while under the command of [[General Admiral]] [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia|Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich]].<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 100, 104, 109</ref>

Sometime after ''Bronenosets'' was completed, an armored ring, {{convert|5|in|0}} thick and {{convert|15|in|0}} tall, was fitted around the base of the turret to prevent splinters from jamming it. Later, an armored, outward-curving [[wikt:bulwark|bulwark]] was fitted around the top of the turret to protect any crewmen there. Three [[sponson]]s were later added, probably during the 1870s, to the upper portion of the turret. Each sponson, one above the [[Glossary of nautical terms#G|gun ports]] and one on each side of the turret, mounted a light gun, probably a {{convert|1.75|in|adj=on}} Engstrem gun, for defense against [[torpedo boat]]s. A fourth gun was mounted on a platform aft of the funnel when a [[Deck (ship)#Hurricane deck|hurricane deck]] was built between the funnel and the turret, also probably during the 1870s.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 108</ref>

Little is known about the ship's career other than that she was [[Ship decommissioning|laid up]] each winter when the Gulf of Finland froze. ''Bronenosets'' was reclassified as a [[coastal defense ship|coast defense]] [[ironclad]] on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of [[Kronstadt]] for disposal on 6 July 1900, although she was not stricken until 17 August. During 1903, the ship was converted into a coal barge by the removal of her turret, her side armor, and its wooden backing, and by the division of her hull into three [[Hold (ship)|holds]].<ref name=m9>McLaughlin, p. 109</ref> She was redesignated as ''Barzha No. 34'', ''Barzha No. 51'' and, in 1914, ''Barzha No. 324''. The ship sank in a storm in the Gulf of Finland sometime during World War I.<ref name=m9/>
