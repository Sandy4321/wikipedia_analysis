'''Ben Rothman''' is currently the number one ranked croquet player in North America and the United States of America.  After focusing his life towards the game in 2007, he has become a formidable force and a player to beat in serious competition around the world.  Over the past few years Ben has won many high profile [[croquet]] tournaments and competed in such major competitions as many [[United States Croquet Association|USCA]] National Championships, the [[World Croquet Federation|WCF]] World Championships, the [[MacRobertson International Croquet Shield|MacRobertson Shield]], and the Solomon Trophy.

==Early life==
Ben Hunter Rothman was born on November 9, 1983, in Berkeley, California.  During his childhood while visiting family in Maine over the summers, he learned to play croquet from a cousin of his, Laurence Stettner, affectionately known as "Uncle Larry".<ref>Bob Alman, [http://www.croquetworld.com/People/rothman.asp "His breakthrough year: A courtside chat with Ben Rothman"] "Croquet World Online", December 8th, 2008</ref>  Ben began playing nine-wicket croquet, entering his first tournament in 1995, the Claremont Classic.  By 1996 he was playing American six wicket, and began winning tournaments.  Association rules and golf croquet tournaments soon followed.  

Following high school, Ben graduated from the University of California, San Diego, in 2006 with a bachelor's degree in psychology.  During his time at UCSD he remained a competitive sportsman through his active participation in ultimate frisbee.  After graduation Ben soon turned to croquet full time.

==Professional Life==
Ben has been described as a "croquet nomad" due to his extensive travelling, and competitive croquet lifestyle.<ref>Rich Curtis, [http://croquetworld.com/People/2009-grad-prix.asp "Rothman is USCA "Player of the Year" for 2009"], "Croquet World Online", February 6th, 2010</ref>  Currently Ben spends his winters in Rancho Mirage, California, at the Mission Hills Country Club where he is the resident croquet professional for the Mission Hills Croquet Club.  The 2011/2012 season marks his third year at Mission Hills and under his tutelage, the Mission Hills Croquet Club has won the USCA "Club of the Year" twice in a row (2010 and 2011).  Here Ben directs regional, national, and club tournaments, as well as instructs groups and individuals for clinics and private lessons.<ref>[http://www.missionhillscroquet.com/ Mission Hills Croquet Club website]</ref>  The summer months he spends traveling the world, playing tournaments as well as directing clinics and tournaments across the United States.

==Serious Play==
Ben began touring across North America in 2007 and less than a year later, in 2008, was touring internationally.  He is a top competitor in any tournament he enters and has numerous wins under his belt.  In 2009, then again in 2010, he won the Grand Prix and was awarded "Player of the Year" by the USCA.  Ben  is the first player to win twice in a row since the Grand Prix was re-instituted in 1999.  In 2010 he won with 35,150 points, setting a new record.<ref>[http://www.croquetworld.com/News/grandprix-2010.asp "Rothman scores first-ever consecutive Grand Prix titles"], "Croquet World Online", February 12th, 2011</ref>
