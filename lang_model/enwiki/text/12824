'''''Shojo Beat''''' is a [[sh<U+014D>jo]] [[manga]] magazine published in North America by [[Viz Media]]. Released in June 2005 as a sister magazine for ''[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]]'', the magazine features serialized chapters from six manga series as well as articles on Japanese culture, manga, [[anime]], fashion and beauty. Since its initial launch, the magazine has undergone two redesigns, becoming the first English anthology to use the two-color tone pages common in Japanese manga anthologies. Viz launched related "Shojo Beat" [[imprint]]s in its manga, [[light novel]], and anime divisions to coordinate with the magazine's contents.

Targeted at women ages 16&ndash;18, the first issue of ''Shojo Beat'' launched with a circulation of 20,000 copies. By 2007, average circulation was approximately 38,000 copies. Half of its circulation comes from [[Subscription business model|subscriptions]] rather than [[Retailing|store sales]].

==History==
In February 2005, [[Viz Media]] announced the creation of a new manga anthology, ''Shojo Beat''. Marketed as a sister publication of Viz's existing ''[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]]'', the magazine started with  six manga titles: ''Crimson Hero'', ''Kaze Hikaru'', ''Baby & Me'', ''Godchild'', ''NANA'', and ''Absolute Boyfriend''.<ref name="VizAnnounce">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-02-08/shojo-beat-details |title=Shojo Beat Details |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2005-02-08 |accessdate=2008-03-07 }}</ref><ref name="HappyBirthday" /> Of the six titles, two each came from Japanese publishers [[Shueisha]], [[Shogakukan]], and [[Hakusensha]].  The first issue was released in June 2005, featuring [[Nana Komatsu]] of ''[[Nana (manga)|NANA]]'' on its July-dated cover. Yumi Hoashi was the publication's original [[editor-in-chief]]. In November 2006, Hoashi left Viz and Marc Weidenbaum replaced him as the magazine's editor-in-chief.<ref name="EiC">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2006-11-15/viz-names-new-shonen-jump-shojo-beat-editor-in-chief |title=Viz Names New Shonen Jump, Shojo Beat Editor-in-Chief |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2006-11-15 |accessdate=2008-03-07 }}</ref><ref name="EiC2">{{cite web |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/9632.html |title=Marc Weidenbaum Named V.P.

The magazine's panda mascot, Moko, was first introduced in the October 2005 issue,<ref>{{cite journal | year=2005 |month=October |title=Contest: Panda Pr<U+00EA>t-<U+00E0>-Porter |journal=Shojo Beat |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=p. 268  |issn=1932-1600 }}</ref> though he remained nameless until the July 2006 issue.<ref>{{cite journal | year=2006 |month=July |title=Editor's Letter |journal=Shojo Beat |volume=2 |issue=7 |pages=p. 006  |issn=1932-1600 }}</ref> He later was given his own MySpace account run by Viz.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myspace.com/mokoworld |title=Moko World |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |accessdate=2008-08-28 }}</ref> With the magazine's first anniversary issue, dated July 2006, ''Shojo Beat'' switched to using cyan and magenta ink tones for the manga pages. Though this mirrors the format of Japanese manga anthologies, it was a first for manga anthologies published in North America.<ref name="1stAnniversary">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2006-05-15/first-anniversary-issue-of-shojo-beat |title=First Anniversary Issue of Shojo Beat |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2006-05-15 |accessdate=2008-06-13 }}</ref>

''Shojo Beat'' launched another redesign with the January 2007 issue. The new design included more vivid color schemes and fonts and a new "Girl Hero" column to spotlight women Viz felt were charitable and selfless to inspire the readers.  The existing columns were also expanded. The issue introduced a new mascot for the magazine, Beat Girl, who was included in each issue on the "Editor's Letter" page as the magazine's "illustrated spokesperson," drawn by different artists each time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2006-12-19/viz-media-announces-new-look-and-expanded-coverage-for-shojo-beat |title=Viz Media Announces New Look and Expanded Coverage for Shojo Beat |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2006-12-19 |accessdate=2008-06-13 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | year=2008 |month=March |title=Editor's Letter: Art, Girl |journal=Shojo Beat |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=p. 006  |issn=1932-1600 }}</ref> In the March 2008 issue, a third mascot, a star named Hoshiko, was introduced as a friend for Moko.<ref>{{cite journal | year=2008 |month=March |title=Editor's Letter: Art, Girl |journal=Shojo Beat |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=p. 319  |issn=1932-1600 }}</ref>

==Features==
As a manga anthology, the bulk of ''Shojo Beat's'' content is its manga chapters. Additional features include a letter from the editor, manga related news, a preview chapter from another Viz manga title being published under their "Shojo Beat" label, and articles on [[Japanese culture]], current trends in Japan, and fashion and beauty. The end of the magazine has fan related sections, including [[fan art]], letters from readers, manga drawing lessons, and [[cosplay]] how-to guides and highlights.<ref name="HappyBirthday" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shojobeat.com/inthemagazine/33.php |publisher=Viz Media |work=Shojo Beat Online |title=In the Magazine |accessdate=2008-03-07 }}</ref> The magazine's official website includes additional articles, downloads of templates for dressing up the magazine's panda mascot "Moko", and online previews of many of the manga series being published under the "Shojo Beat" label.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shojobeat.com/downloads/ |publisher=Viz Media |work=Shojo Beat Online |title=Downloads |accessdate=2008-03-07 }}</ref>

Only four of those remained in the magazine until all of their chapters had been published. Each title serialized in the magazine is also published in ''[[tank<U+014D>bon]]'' volumes under Viz's "Shojo Beat" label. Viz notes that they periodically remove series from the magazine that have not been completed yet to help "keep the magazine fresh" and to allow them to speed up publication of the individual volumes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2006-08-19/godchild-not-returning-to-shojo-beat |title=Godchild Not Returning to Shojo Beat |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2006-08-19 |accessdate=2008-06-13 }}</ref>

===Imprints===
With the launch of the ''Shojo Beat'' magazine, Viz Media also created new imprints for its manga and  fiction lines, with the "Shojo Beat" label including both series featured in the magazine and other [[sh<U+014D>jo]] manga titles licensed by Viz since the magazine's conception.  Published under the "Shojo Beat Fiction" imprint, Viz began releasing a few Japanese [[light novels]] that relate to its "Shojo Beat" manga titles.<ref name="VizNovels">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-06-04/viz-to-publish-novels |title=Viz to Publish Novels |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2005-06-04 |accessdate=2008-03-07 }}</ref><ref name="VizNovels2">{{cite web |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/6985.html |title=Viz Launches New Fiction Imprints |publisher=ICv2 News |date=2005-06-06 |accessdate=2008-03-07 }}</ref> In February 2006, Viz launched the  "Shojo Beat Home Video" line to release [[anime]] titles targeted towards the female audience.  The first title under the new imprint was ''[[Full Moon o Sagashite]]'', the anime adaptation of the same titled manga already being released by Viz Media. To promote the new anime line, Viz included a preview disc of the first volume of ''Full Moon'' in the June 2006 issue of ''Shojo Beat''.<ref name="SBVideo">{{cite web |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/8244.html |title=Viz Launches Shojo Beat Home Video Line |publisher=ICv2 News |date=2006-02-20 |accessdate=2008-03-07 }}</ref>

The magazine's audience is overwhelmingly female, comprising 91% of its readers. Targeted towards "young women", over half of the ''Shojo Beat'' audience is between the ages of 13 and 19, and over 84% of readers are at least 16 years old.<ref name="Viz2008PK" />

==Reception==
In reviewing the premiere release of ''Shojo Beat'', [[IGN]]'s Jessica Chabot sharply criticized the magazine. She felt it looked and read "like a teenie-bopper magazine" and referred to the issue's cover as a "bright, hot-pink, migraine-inducing, bubble-lettered spectacle". She considered the contents boring, and disagreed with Viz's selection of series, noting, "It's as if Viz had taken everything from their backed-up reject pile and tried to pull one over on the female populace. 90% of what I was reading was either poorly drawn or poorly written (more often than not, it was both)."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/632/632083p1.html |title=Shojo Beat: The Verdict |first=Jessica |last=Chabot |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=2005-07-05 |accessdate=2008-09-30 }}</ref> ''Comic World News''' David Welsh disagreed, as he felt that the magazine had several good series, and he praised ''[[Nana]]'', ''[[Absolute Boyfriend]]'' and ''[[Crimson Hero]]'' as the top three series of the initial issue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicworldnews.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi?column=flipped&page=26 |title=Title Pun Shortage Strikes Manga Columnist |first=David |last=Welsh |work=[[Comic World News]] |date=2008-02-14 |accessdate=2008-09-30 }}</ref> Greg McElhatton, co-founder of ''[[Wizard: The Guide to Comics]]'' and former reviewer for iComics.com, praised the magazine's mainstream appearance, calling it a "smart" decision, as it would draw in its target audience by visually showing them that its a magazine for teenage girls. While he felt two of the manga titles in the premiere issue had weak openings, he found that the magazine was "off to a good, if not great start".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.readaboutcomics.com/2005/06/15/shojo-beat-vol-1-issue-1/ |title=Shojo Beat Vol. 1, Issue 1 |first=Greg |last=McElhatton |publisher=Read About Comics |date=2005-06-15 |accessdate=2008-10-01 }}</ref>
