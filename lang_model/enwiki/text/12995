'''HMS ''Cumberland''''', the fifteenth [[HMS Cumberland|ship of that name]] was a [[County class cruiser|County class]] [[heavy cruiser]] of the [[Royal Navy]] that saw action during the [[Second World War]].

==Overview==
''Cumberland'' served on the China Station with the [[5th Cruiser Squadron]] until 1938.

At the start of the [[Second World War]] in 1939, ''Cumberland'' was assigned to Force G, the South American Division.  At the start of December she was forced to self-refit in the [[Falkland Islands]], thus depriving the force of their strongest unit.  Without her, HMS ''Exeter'', ''Ajax'' and ''Achilles'' engaged the German raider ''[[Admiral Graf Spee]]'' in the [[Battle of the River Plate]] on [[13 December]]. ''Cumberland'' received a garbled indication that a contact was being made and moved north to reinforce, arriving at the [[River Plate]] at 22:00 [[14 December]], after steaming for 34 hours.  The ''Graf Spee'' had put into neutral [[Montevideo]] and was trapped there, as ''Cumberland'' along with ''Ajax'' and ''Achilles'' (''Exeter'' having been heavily damaged) patrolled the estuary, resulting in the ''Graf Spee'' being scuttled by her crew on [[17 December]].

''Cumberland'' won battle honours in North Africa 1942.

In October 1941 ''Cumberland'' joined the [[1st Cruiser Squadron]] [[Home Fleet]] escorting the [[Russian Convoy]]s until January 1944, winning the battle honour ''Arctic 1942-1943''.

She was then transferred to the Far East, as part of [[4th Cruiser Squadron]] [[Eastern Fleet]], and won the battle honours ''Sabang 1944'' and ''Burma 1945''.

She returned to the [[United Kingdom]] on [[12 November]] [[1945]] and transported troops until June 1946, when she was placed in reserve until 1949.  She was then refitted at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] (1949-1951) as a trials cruiser, and used from 1951 to 1959 for the testing of new equipment. By the late 1950s, with almost every other pre-war ship scrapped, she was the oldest active warship in the Navy.

For the 1956 [[film]] [[The Battle of the River Plate (film)|''The Battle of the River Plate'']], ''Cumberland'' played herself (being partly disarmed).

''Cumberland'' was laid up for a second time in January 1959 and was broken up by Cashmore, [[Newport]], arriving there on [[3 November]] [[1959]].
