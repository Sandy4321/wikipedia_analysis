'''''Like Water for Chocolate''''' is an album by [[rapper]] [[Common (rapper)|Common]], released in March 2000. It was a considerable commercial breakthrough for the [[rapper]], shipping [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] in sales, off the strength of the single "The Light". The video for "The Light" was frequently shown on [[MTV]], adding to Common's exposure. 

The album also marked the coming together of the [[Soulquarians]]; a collective made primarily of [[?uestlove]] (of [[The Roots]]), the late [[J Dilla]] / [[Jay Dee]] (formerly of [[Slum Village]]), keyboardist [[James Poyser]], bassist [[Pino Palladino]] and other collaborators. This group of musicians would also be featured on Common's next album, ''[[Electric Circus (album)|Electric Circus]]''.

''Like Water for Chocolate'' is also notable for its [[Afrocentric]] themes. It borrows from the [[Afrobeat]] genre on the track "Time Travelin' (A Tribute To Fela)", the [[Tony Allen]]-sampling "Heat" and the Slum Village-assisted "Nag Champa (Afrodisiac For The World)". 

[[MC Lyte]] and [[Mos Def]] join Common for the amusing "A Film Called (Pimp)" and "The Questions", respectively. In the former Common sends up his own "conscious" image with a skit depicting him as a hypocritical woman-beater.

Like the previous two albums, ''Like Water for Chocolate'' closes with [[spoken word]] recited by Common's father Lonnie "Pops" Lynn. A slightly altered version of the album was released after its success on the charts, with the [[Macy Gray]]-assisted remix of "Geto Heaven Part Two" replacing the original.
