__TOC__

==Flag history==
The design was the result of a two-year campaign sparked by a letter to ''County News'' from two readers keen to raise the county's profile. Fred and Pat Rickett, from [[Moulton, Lincolnshire|Moulton]], both keen caravanners, wrote to the paper in 2003, asking why Lincolnshire had no flag that they could fly on caravan rallies.

Their plea was taken up by BBC Radio Lincolnshire, which launched a campaign in partnership with Lincolnshire Life magazine that culminated in a popular vote. Their campaign was supported by many local businesses, who saw it as a good way to promote trade and tourism in Lincolnshire. However, in a Lincolnshire County Council poll that was concluded on 31 October 2005 it was asked: "Do you like the design of the new Lincolnshire Flag?" Of the 273 votes recorded, 34% said "''Yes''" and 66% said "''No''".<ref>{{cite web

==Flag design==
The flag features a red cross, edged in yellow and bearing a yellow [[fleur-de-lys]], on a background of green and blue quarters; in the jargon of [[blazon]], ''Quarterly Vert and Azure, on a Cross Gules fimbriated Or a Fleur-de-Lys of the last''.  

Yellow represents the crops grown in the county, as well as the nickname Yellowbellies given to people born and bred in Lincolnshire. Blue represents both the sea of the East coast and the wide skies of Lincolnshire, and green symbolises the rich lushness of fenland fields. The [[fleur de lys]] is a recognised symbol of the City of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]].

The Pantone Colours for the flag are:- <ref name= "flaginstitute"/>
* Green 355
* Blue 286
* Yellow 109
* Red 186
