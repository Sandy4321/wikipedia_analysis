The '''Exelon Pavilions''' are a set of four [[solar energy]] generating structures in [[Millennium Park]] in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago]] in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States|USA]]. The '''Northeast Exelon Pavilion''' and '''Northwest Exelon Pavilion''' (jointly the '''North Exelon Pavilions''') are located on the northern edge of the park along [[Randolph Street]].  The '''Southeast Exelon Pavilion''' and '''Southeast Exelon Pavilion''' (jointly the '''South Exelon Pavilions''') are located on southern edge of the park along Monroe Street.  The pavilions provide sufficient energy to power the equivalent of 14 [[Energy Star|star-rated]] energy-efficient houses in Chicago.<ref name=A&AEPMPWCaGE/>

The Pavilions were designed in January 2001 and construction began in January 2004.  The South Pavilions were completed and opened in July 2004 and the North Pavilions were completed in November 2004, with a grand opening on [[April 30]][[2005]].<ref name=A&AEPFaF>{{cite web|url=http://www.millenniumpark.org/artandarchitecture/exelon_pavilions_factsheet.html|title=Art & Architecture: Exelon Pavilions Facts and Figures|accessdate=2008-06-07|publisher=City of Chicago}}</ref>  In addition to producing energy, three of the four pavilions provide access to the park's below ground [[parking garage]]s and the fourth serves as the park's welcoming center.<ref name=A&AEPMPWCaGE/>  [[Exelon]], a company that generates the electricity transmitted by its subsidiary [[Commonwealth Edison]], donated $5.5 million for the Pavilions.<ref name=NEPRaLSRftUSGBC/>

==Details==
Exelon and ComEd have collaborated with the city of Chicago on a variety of [[environmental]] projects, such as the installation of [[solar power]].  The solar-powered buildings are a result of Exelon<U+2019>s joint efforts with the city to support [[sustainable design]] and [[renewable energy]] while furthering educational and social awareness of "green" architecture in Chicago.<ref name=NEPRaLSRftUSGBC/>  The [[United States Department of Energy]] has recognized the buildings as part of their Million Solar Roofs Initiative, helping Chicago rank fourth among U.S. cities in solar installations.<ref name=TMPWCOitNEP/>

===North Pavilions===
[[Image:Inside Exelon Pavilion.jpg|thumb|left|Ceiling inside Northwest Pavilion]]
The North Pavilions were designed as by Hammond Beeby Rupert Ainge Architects,<ref name=TMPWCOitNEP/><ref name=A&AEPFaF/> with Thomas H. Beeby as lead designer.<ref name=A&AEPFaF/> Beeby designed the North Pavilions to be in harmony with the neighboring [[Harris Theater (Chicago)|Harris Theater]], a performing-arts theater on the northern edge of Millenium Park.

Each of the pavilions is layered with an outer [[recycling|recycled]]-aluminum curtain wall on the exterior.  These contain specially designed mounted mono-[[crystalline]] photovoltaic modules and insulated glass. The Photovoltaic modules cover an air cavity in which [[convection|convective air]] cycles as a result of radiant [[solar heat gain]]. The roof is [[waterproof]]ed with a highly heat-reflective [[thermoplastic]] membrane that combats the [[Urban heat island|urban heat-island effect]]. Several other construction materials are derived from [[renewable resource]]s. The pavilions<U+2019> exterior [[canopy|canopies]] are partly lit by ground-lights that operate on photocells, activated at sunset.<ref name=HBRAEP/>

====Northwest Pavilion====
The Northwest Pavilion, located at 151 E. Randolph Street,<ref name=EPaMPRS/> houses the Millennium Park Welcome Center and the Exelon energy display.<ref name=A&AEPMPWCaGE/> The Northwest Pavilion also contains Millennium Park offices, and public washrooms.<ref name=TMPWCOitNEP/>  It is the only pavilion that does not provide access to the parking garage below.<ref name=A&AEPMPWCaGE/>  The Northwest Pavilion augments its photovoltaic exterior, energy efficient design characteristics such as recycling facilities and further construction materials derived from renewable resources.<ref name=NEPRaLSRftUSGBC/>

The Millennium Park Welcome Center offers guides to the park, [[wheelchair]]s and is a venue for exhibitions on energy, parks and other themes. Interactive displays have educated visitors on renewable energy and the workings of the solar panels covering the pavilion.  The exhibits have a [[touch screen]] interactive [[web-based]] component depicting the city's use of solar energy. The exhibits also  have a dynamic multi-screen video presentation on electicity usage. The building's [[atrium]] includes a sculptural installation with backlit three {{convert|9|ft|m|1|adj=on}} two-way mirrors by  Chicago-based artists Patrick McGee and Adelheid Mers that describes the links between the Earth<U+2019>s [[atmosphere]], the [[solar system]] and scientific applications.<ref name=TMPWCOitNEP/>

====Northeast Pavilion====
The Northeast Pavilion houses a pedestrian entrance to the Millennium Park parking garage as well as the Chicago Shop at Millennium Park, which is open to the public.<ref name=TMPWCOitNEP/>  The Chicago Shop, which is located on the second floor of the Northeast Pavilion, 201 E. Randolph Street offers self-guided Millennium Park [[audio tour]] for rental.  The shop also sells official Millennium Park and Chicago souvenirs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://egov.cityofchicago.org/city/webportal/portalCategoryTreeAction.do?deptMainCategoryOID=-536887892&categoryPath=%2fCity+Agencies%2fCity+Departments%2fCity+of+Chicago%2fSub+Agencies%2fMillennium+Park%2fFAQ+Categories&success=FAQ&entityName=Millennium+Park&topChannelName=SubAgency&contentType=COC_FAQ&Failed_Reason=Invalid+timestamp,+engine+has+been+restarted&com.broadvision.session.new=Yes&Failed_Page=%2fwebportal%2fportalCategoryTreeAction.do|title=Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=2008-06-08|publisher=City of Chicago}}</ref>  The Northeast Pavilion also provides access to the Harris Theater Terrace.<ref name=EPaMPRS>{{cite web|url=http://chicagosolarpartnership.com/index.php?src=directory&srctype=display&id=169&view=pvsites_detail|title=Exelon Pavilions at Millennium Park - Randolph St.|accessdate=2008-06-08|publisher=The Chicago Solar Partnership}}</ref>

===South Pavilions===
The [[facade]]s of the South Pavlions are [[limestone]] and [[glass]] in order to compliment the Modern Wing of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].<ref name=TMPWCOitNEP/> The South Pavilions were designed by [[Renzo Piano]],<ref name=TMPWCOitNEP/><ref name=A&AEPFaF/> who is also the designer of the Art Insitute's new modern wing and the [[Nichols Bridgeway]].  The Southwest Pavilion (pictured right) is the smallest of the Pavilions with {{convert|550|sqft|m2|1}} of solar energy surface,<ref name=A&AEPFaF/> which is composed of 16 photovoltaic modules.<ref name=TMPWCOitNEP/>  The Southeast Pavilion has {{convert|750|sqft|m2|1}} of solar energy surface,<ref name=A&AEPFaF/> which is composed of 24 photovoltaic modules.<ref name=TMPWCOitNEP/>  They are located to the east and west of the [[Lurie Garden]].<ref name=TMPWCOitNEP/>  These pavlions are capable of producing {{convert|3840|kWh|MBtu|1}} of electricity annually.<ref name=TMPWCOitNEP/>
