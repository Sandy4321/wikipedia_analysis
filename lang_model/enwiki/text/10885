'''Stephen Crane''' ([[November 1]], [[1871]] &ndash; [[June 5]], [[1900]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[novelist]], [[poet]] and [[journalist]]. The eighth surviving child of highly devout parents&mdash;his father was a [[Methodism|Methodist]] minister and his mother a leading member of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]]&mdash;Crane was raised mostly by his older siblings in various parts of [[New Jersey]]. Crane began writing at an early age, completing his first short story at the age of fourteen.  After attending school with little interest for academic studies, he traveled to [[New York]] to work as a reporter.

Crane's first novel was ''[[Maggie: A Girl of the Streets]]'', which was published in 1893.  He followed with various short stories and poems, but won international acclaim for his 1895 [[American Civil War|Civil War]] novel ''[[The Red Badge of Courage]]''.  In 1897, he endured a highly publicized scandal after he acted as a witness for a suspected prostitute.  In order to escape the media, he accepted an offer to work as a war correspondent.  While living in Florida before finding passage to [[Cuba]] to cover the [[Spanish-American War]], he met [[Cora Crane|Cora Taylor]], the madam of a brothel and his future [[Common-law marriage|common-law wife]].  While en route to Cuba, Crane's ship sank off the coast of Florida, leaving him marooned for several days in a small [[dinghy]]. His ordeal was later described in his short story "[[The Open Boat]]".  He later covered conflicts in [[Greece]] and Cuba and wrote numerous dispatches and stories detailing his experiences. During the last year of his life, Crane took refuge in the south of [[England]] with Cora.  Plagued by exhaustion and ill health, Stephen Crane died of [[tuberculosis]] in a sanatorium in the [[Black Forest]] at the age of twenty-eight. 

Prolific throughout his short life, Crane's work includes numerous novels, short stories and poems as well as non-fiction articles, dispatches and letters.  His fiction is heralded as early examples of American [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]], [[literary realism|Realism]] and/or [[Impressionism (literature)|Impressionism]].  Stylistically, his writing is characterized by vividness and intensity as well as his use of imagery and irony.  His poems, or "lines", are considered unique for the period and were ridiculed by the media for their unconventional use of [[free verse]] and lack of rhyme and meter.  Crane and his work were nearly forgotten until two decades after his death but today he is considered one of the most innovative American writers of the 1890s.<ref name="ben3">Benfey, p. 3</ref>

==Biography==
===Early years===
Stephen Crane was born [[November 1]], [[1871]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Jersey]] to Reverend Jonathan Townley Crane, a [[Methodism|Methodist]] minister, and Mary Helen Peck Crane, a clergyman's daughter.<ref>Davis, p. 4</ref>  He was the fourteenth and last child born to the couple; the forty-five year old Mary Crane had lost her four previous children, who each died within one year of birth.<ref>Stallman, p. 1</ref>  Nicknamed "Stevie" by the family, he joined eight surviving brothers and sisters&mdash;Mary Helen, George Peck, Jonathan Townley, William Howe, Agnes Elizabeth, Edmund Byran, Wilbur Fiske, and Luther.<ref name="Dav10">Davis, p. 10</ref>  Family legend maintains that Crane was descended from and named for a founder of [[Elizabethtown, New Jersey]], who had come from England or Wales as early as 1665,<ref>Davis, p. 5</ref> and a [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] patriot who served two terms as a delegate from New Jersey to the [[Continental Congress]] in [[Philadelphia]].<ref name="Wer1">Wertheim, p. 1</ref>  Crane would later write that his father, Dr. Crane, "was a great, fine, simple mind" who had written "numerous" tracts on theology.<ref>Stallman, p. 6</ref>  His mother was an eloquent spokeswoman for the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]], but although she was a highly religious woman, Crane didn't believe that "she was as narrow as most of her friends or family."<ref>Beer, p. 49</ref>  Because of his parents' preoccupation, the young Stephen was raised primarily by his sister Agnes, who was fifteen years his senior.<ref name="Wer1"/>  In 1876, the family moved to [[Port Jervis, New York]] where Dr. Crane became the pastor of Drew Methodist Church, a position that he retained until his death.<ref name="Wer1"/> 

As a child, Stephen was often sickly and afflicted by constant colds.<ref>Stallman, p. 3</ref>  His father wrote in his diary when the young boy was not yet two that his youngest son became "so sick that we are anxious about him."  Despite his fragile nature, Crane was a precocious child who taught himself to read before the age of four.<ref name="Dav10"/>  His first known inquiry, recorded by his father, dealt with writing; at the age of three, while imitating his brother Townley's writing, he asked his mother, "how do you spell ''O''?"<ref>Berryman, p. 10</ref>  In December 1879, Crane wrote a poem about wanting a dog for Christmas.  Entitled "I'd Rather Have -", it is his first surviving poem.<ref>Wertheim, p. 21</ref>  Stephen was not regularly enrolled in school until January 1880,<ref>Wertheim, p. 17</ref> but had no difficulty in completing two grades in six weeks.  Recalling this feat, he wrote that it "sounds like the lie of a fond mother at a teaparty, but I do remember that I got ahead very fast and that father was very pleased with me."<ref>Stallman, p. 7</ref>

Dr. Crane died on [[February 16]], [[1880]] at the age of 60.  He was mourned by some fourteen hundred people, more than double the size of his congregation.<ref>Davis, p. 15&ndash;16</ref>  After her husband's death, Mrs. Crane moved her family to [[Roseville, Newark, New Jersey|Roseville]], near Newark.  After living with his brother William in [[Port Jervis, New York|Port Jervis]] for a few years, Stephen and his sister Helen then moved to [[Asbury Park]] to be with their brother Townley and his wife.  Townley was a professional journalist; he headed the Long Branch department of both the ''New York Tribune'' and the ''Associated Press'' and also served as editor of the ''Asbury Park Shore Press''.  Agnes took a position at Asbury Park's intermediate school and moved in with Helen to care for the young Stephen.<ref>Davis, p. 17</ref>  Within a couple of years, several more losses struck the Crane family.  First, Townley's wife, Fannie, died of [[Bright's disease]] in 1883 after the deaths of the couple's two young children.  Agnes then became ill and died on [[June 10]], [[1884]] of [[meningitis|cerebrospinal meningitis]] at the age of twenty-eight.<ref>Davis, p. 19</ref>

===Schooling===
Crane wrote his first known story, "Uncle Jake and the Bell Handle", when he was fourteen.<ref>Davis, p. 20</ref>  In the fall of 1885 he enrolled at Pennington Seminary, a ministry-focused coeducational boarding school seven miles north of [[Trenton]],<ref>Davis, p. 21</ref> where his father had been principal from 1849 to 1858.<ref name="Wer1"/>  Soon after her youngest son left for school, Mrs. Crane began suffering what the ''Asbury Park Shore Press'' reported as "a temporary aberration of the mind."<ref>Wertheim, p. 34</ref>  Although she apparently recovered, the fourth death in Stephen's immediate family in six years came when the twenty-three year old Luther died after falling in front of an oncoming train while working as a flagman for the Erie Railroad.<ref>Davis, p. 22</ref> 

[[Image:Craneinuniform.jpg|thumb|Cadet Crane in uniform at the age of seventeen]] 
After two years, Crane left Pennington for Claverack College, a quasi-military school.  He would later look back on his time at Claverack as "the happiest period of my life although I was not aware of it."<ref>Davis, p. 23</ref>  A classmate remembered him as a highly literate but erratic student, lucky to pass examinations in math and science, and yet "far in advance of his fellow students in his knowledge of History and Literature", his favorite subjects.<ref name="Dav24">Davis, p. 24</ref>  He took to signing his name "Stephen T. Crane" because, not having a middle name like the other students, he tried "to win recognition as a regular fellow".<ref name="Dav24"/>  Crane was seen as friendly, but also moody and rebellious.  He was not adverse to skipping class in order to play baseball, a game in which he starred as catcher,<ref>Stallman, p. 19</ref> although he was also greatly interested in the school's military training program.  He rose rapidly in the ranks of the student battalion.<ref>Wertheim, p. 41</ref>  One classmate described him as "indeed physically attractive without being handsome," but he was aloof, reserved and not generally popular at Claverack.<ref>Davis, p. 28</ref>         

In the summer of 1888, Crane became his brother Townley's assistant in reporting about the New Jersey shore.<ref>Wertheim, p. 44</ref>  Crane's first signed publication was an article on the explorer [[Henry M. Stanley]]'s famous quest to find the English missionary [[David Livingstone]] in [[Africa]].  It appeared in the February 1890 Claverack College ''Vidette''.<ref>Stallman, p. 24</ref>  Within a few months, however, Crane was persuaded by his family to forgo a military career and transfer to [[Lafayette College]] in [[Easton, Pennsylvania]] in order to pursue a mining engineering degree.<ref>Wertheim, p. 51</ref>  He registered at Lafayette on September 12 and promptly became involved in extracurricular activities; he took up baseball once more and joined the largest fraternity, [[Delta Upsilon]], and two rival groups: the Washington Literary Society and the Franklin Literary Society.<ref>Davis, p. 30</ref>  Crane infrequently attended classes and ended the semester with grades for four of the seven courses he had taken.<ref>Davis, p. 31</ref>  After only one semester, Crane transferred to [[Syracuse University]] where he enrolled as a non-degree candidate in the College of Liberal Arts.<ref>Wertheim, p. 56</ref>  He roomed in the Delta Upsilon fraternity house and joined the baseball team.  Attending merely one class (English Literature) during the middle trimester, he remained in residence while taking no courses in the third trimester.<ref>Wertheim, p. 59</ref>  

Putting more emphasis on his writing, Crane began to experiment with tone and style while trying out different subjects.<ref>Davis, p. 35</ref>  A fictional story of his called "Great Bugs of Onondaga" ran simultaneously in the ''Syracuse Daily Standard'' and the ''New York Tribune''.<ref>Wertheim, p. 61</ref>  Claiming that "college is a waste of time", Crane decided to become a newspaper reporter.  Shortly after attending a Delta Upsilon chapter meeting on [[June 12]], [[1891]], Crane left college for good.<ref>Davis, p. 37</ref>

===Post-education and full-time writing===
From the beginning of his writing career, Crane's "chiefest desire was to write plainly and unmistakably, so that all men (and some women) might read and understand.  That to my mind is good writing."<ref>Stallman, p. 33</ref>  Soon after leaving school, Crane showed two of his stories to editor and author [[Willis Fletcher Johnson]] who accepted them for publication in the ''Tribune'''s Sunday supplement.  In February 1892, "Hunting Wild Dogs" and "The Last of the Mohicans", the first in a series of unsigned Sullivan County sketches and tales, appeared in print.<ref>Wertheim, p. 71</ref>  One of the most important events in Crane's life was his meeting [[Hamlin Garland]] in 1891.  Garland was lecturing on American literature and the expressive arts in Avon, and on August 17 he gave a talk on novelist [[William Dean Howells]], which Crane wrote up for the ''Tribune''.<ref>Stallman, p. 34</ref>

In the fall of 1891, Stephen moved into his brother Edmund's house in Lake View, a suburb of [[Paterson, New Jersey]].  He began living as a full-time writer, making trips to New York and wandering into tenements and exploring [[the Bowery]]'s saloons, dance halls, brothels and flophouses.<ref name="Dav42">Davis, p. 42</ref>  Crane believed that human nature here "was open and plain, with nothing hidden" and that is why he was drawn there.<ref name="Dav42"/>  The end of that year was filled not only with inspiration, but also with tragedy; on December 7, Crane's mother died at the age of sixty-four.  The twenty-year old Crane appointed his brother Edmund as his guardian.<ref>Davis, p. 43</ref>

Despite being "frail", "undernourished" and suffering from "a hacking cough", which did not prevent him from smoking cigarettes, Crane began a brief romance with a married woman named Lily Brandon Munroe.<ref name="Dav47">Davis, p. 47</ref>  Although Munroe would later say in an interview that Crane "was not a handsome man", she nonetheless admired his "remarkable almond-shaped gray eyes."<ref>Wertheim, p. 74</ref>  He begged her to elope with him, but her family was opposed to the match because of Crane's lack of money and poor prospects, so she declined.<ref name="Dav47"/>

===Life in New York===

| style="text-align: left;" | "Within him, as he hurled himself forward, was born a love, a despairing fondness for this flag which was near him. It was a creation of beauty and invulnerability. It was a goddess, radiant, that bended its form with an imperious gesture to him. It was a woman, red and white, hating and loving, that called him with the voice of his hopes."

In October 1892, Crane moved into a rooming house in [[Manhattan]] inhabited by a group of medical students.<ref>Wertheim, p. 81</ref>  His first novel, ''[[Maggie: A Girl of the Streets]]'', about a girl who "blossoms in a mud-puddle" and becomes a victim of circumstance, was written during this time.<ref>Davis, pp. 55-56</ref>  In the winter of 1893, Crane brought the manuscript of ''Maggie'' to [[Richard Watson Gilder]], who rejected it for publication in ''[[The Century Magazine]]''.  Crane decided to publish it privately; it was eventually published in late February or early March 1893 by a small printing shop on lower Sixth Avenue that usually printed medical books and religious tracts.  The typewritten title page read simply: "A Girl of the Streets, / A Story of New York. / &mdash;By&mdash;/Stephen Crane."  The name "Maggie" was added to the title later.<ref>Wertheim, p. 83</ref>  Crane used the pseudonym "Johnston Smith" for this initial publication, later telling friend and artist Corwin Knapp Linson that the ''nom de plume'' was the "commonest name I could think of.  I had an editor friend named Johnson, and put in the "t", and no one could find me in the mob of Smiths."<ref>Wertheim, p. 84</ref>  The earliest known review of Crane's work, which appeared on March 13, 1894 in the ''Port Jervis Union'', stated that "the pathos of [Maggie's] sad story will be deeply felt by all susceptible persons who read the book."<ref>Wertheim, p. 85</ref>  Despite this early praise, Crane became depressed and destitute from having spent $869 for 1,100 copies of a novel that did not sell; he ended up giving a hundred copies away.  He would later remember "how I looked forward to publication and pictured the sensation I thought it would make.  It fell flat.  Nobody seemed to notice it or care for it... Poor Maggie! She was one of my first loves."<ref>Stallman, p. 70</ref>

In March 1893, Crane spent hours lounging in friend Corwin Knapp Linson's studio while having his portrait painted.  He became fascinated with issues of the ''Century'' that were largely devoted to famous battles and military leaders from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>Davis, p. 63</ref>  Frustrated with the dryly written stories, Crane stated, "I wonder that some of those fellows don't tell how they ''felt'' in those scraps.  They spout enough of what they ''did'', but they're as emotionless as rocks."<ref>Linson, p. 37</ref>  Crane returned to these magazines during subsequent visits to Linson's studio and eventually the idea of writing a war novel overtook him.  He would later state that he "had been unconsciously working the detail of the story out through most of his boyhood" and had imagined "war stories ever since he was out of [[knickerbockers]]."<ref>Davis, p. 64</ref>  This novel would ultimately become ''[[The Red Badge of Courage]]''. 

[[Image:CranebyLinson1894.jpg|thumb|Detail taken from a 1894 portrait of Crane by friend and photographer Corwin Knapp Linson. Linson said the author's profile reminded him "of the young [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]&mdash;but not so hard, Steve."<ref>Davis, p. 80</ref>]]
From the beginning, Crane wished to show what it felt like to be in a war by writing "a psychological portrayal of fear."<ref name="Dav65">Davis, p. 65</ref>  Conceiving his story from the point of view of a young private who is at first filled with boyish dreams of the glory of war and then quickly becomes disillusioned by war's reality, Crane borrowed the private's surname, "Fleming", from his sister-in-law's maiden name.  He would later relate that the first paragraphs came to him with "every word in place, every comma, every period fixed."<ref name="Dav65"/>  Working mostly nights, he wrote from around midnight until four or five in the morning.  Because he could not afford a typewriter, he wrote carefully in ink on legal-sized paper, seldom crossing through or interlining a word.  If he did change something, he would rewrite the whole page.<ref>Davis, p. 74</ref> 

While working on his second novel, Crane remained prolific, concentrating on publishing stories to stave off poverty; "An Experiment in Misery", based on Crane's experiences in the Bowery, was printed by the ''New York Press''.  He also wrote five or six poems a day.<ref name="Dav82">Davis, p. 82</ref>  In early 1894, he showed some of his poems, or "lines" as he called them, to Hamlin Garland, who said he read "some thirty in all" with "growing wonder."<ref>Wertheim, p. 98</ref>  Although Garland and William Dean Howells encouraged him to send his poetry out for publication, Crane's confessional [[free verse]] was too unconventional for most.  After a brief wrangling between poet and publisher, Crane's first book of poems, ''The Black Riders and Other Lines'', was picked up by Copeland & Day.  He received a 10 percent royalty and the publisher assured him that the book would be in a form "more severely classic than any book ever yet issued in America."<ref>Davis, pp. 92-93</ref> 

In the spring of 1894, Crane offered the finished manuscript of ''The Red Badge of Courage'' to ''[[McClure's Magazine]]'', which had become the foremost magazine for Civil War literature.  While ''McClure's'' delayed giving him an answer on his novel, they offered him an assignment writing about the [[Pennsylvania]] [[coal mine]]s.<ref>Davis, p. 87</ref>  "In the Depths of a Coal Mine", a story with pictures by Linson, was syndicated by ''McClure's'' in a number of newspapers, heavily edited.  Crane was reportedly disgusted by the cuts, asking Linson: "Why the hell did they send me up there then? Do they want the public to think the coal mines gilded ball-rooms with the miners eating ice-cream in boiled shirt-fronts?"<ref>Wertheim, p. 110</ref>

After discovering that ''McClure'' could not afford to pay him, Crane took his war novel to Irving Bacheller of the Bacheller-Johnson Newspaper Syndicate, which agreed to publish ''The Red Badge of Courage'' in serial form. Between the third and the ninth of December 1894, ''The Red Badge of Courage'' began appearing in some half-dozen newspapers in the United States.<ref>Davis, p. 94</ref> Although it was greatly cut for syndication, Bacheller attested to its causing a stir, saying "its quality [was] immediately felt and recognized."<ref>Davis, p. 95</ref> The lead editorial in the ''Philadelphia Press'' of December 7 said that Crane "is a new name now and unknown, but everybody will be talking about him if he goes on as he has begun".<ref>Wertheim, p. 117</ref>

===Travels, fame and scandal===
At the end of January 1895, Crane left on what he called "a very long and circuitous newspaper trip" to the west.<ref>Davis, p. 99</ref>  While writing feature articles for the Bacheller syndicate, he traveled to [[Saint Louis, Missouri]], [[Nebraska]], [[New Orleans]], [[Galveston, Texas]] and then [[Mexico City]].<ref>Wertheim, p. 121</ref>  Irving Bacheller would later state that he "sent Crane to Mexico for new color,"<ref>Stallman, p. 141</ref> which the author found in the form of the Mexican slum life.  Whereas he found the lower class in New York pitiful, he was impressed by the "superiority" of the Mexican peasants' contentment and "even refuse[d] to pity them."<ref>Stallman, p. 144</ref>  Returning to New York five months later, Crane joined the Lantern (alternately spelled "Lanthom" or "Lanthorne") Club organized by a group of young writers and journalists.<ref>Wertheim, p 132</ref>  The Club, which was located in a [[shanty]] on the roof of an old house on William Street near the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], served as a watering hole of sorts and was made to look like a ship's cabin.<ref>Davis, p. 119</ref>  This is where Crane obtained his one square meal a day, although friends worried about Crane's "constant smoking, too much coffee, lack of food and poor teeth," as Nelson Greene put it.<ref>Davis, p. 120</ref>  Living in near poverty and greatly anticipating the publication of his books, Crane began work on two more novels: ''The Third Violet'' and ''[[George's Mother]]''.

''The Black Riders'' was published by Copeland & Day shortly before his return to New York in May, but it received mostly criticism if not abuse for the poems' unusual style and use of free verse.  A piece in the ''Bookman'' called Crane "the [[Aubrey Beardsley]] of poetry"<ref>Davis, p. 117</ref> and a commentator from the ''Chicago Daily Inter-Ocean'' stated that "there is not a line of poetry from the opening to the closing page.  [[Walt Whitman|Whitman's]] ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'' were luminous in comparison.  Poetic lunacy would be a better name for the book."<ref>Wertheim, p. 132</ref>  In June, the ''New York Tribune'' dismissed the book as "so much trash."<ref>Wertheim, p. 135</ref>  Crane, however, was pleased that the book was "making some stir".<ref>Wertheim, p. 134</ref>  In direct contrast to the reception of his poetry, ''The Red Badge of Courage'' was welcomed with great acclaim when it was published by Appleton in September 1895.  Crane was heralded for his insight and unique writing style. Appleton published two, possibly three, printings in 1895 and as many as eleven more in 1896.<ref>Wertheim, p. 141</ref>

There were those who criticized Crane's use of profanity and the story's graphic descriptions. Even so, for four months after its publication the book was in the top six on various bestseller lists around the country.<ref name="Dav129"/>  The ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' said that the novel "will give you so vivid a picture of the emotions and the horrors of the battlefield that you will pray your eyes may never look upon the reality."<ref>Davis, p. 127</ref> [[H. L. Mencken]], who was about fifteen at the time, remembered that the book arrived on the literary scene "like a flash of lightning out of a clear winter sky".<ref name="Dav129">Davis, p. 129</ref> As in America, the book proved popular in [[England]]; [[Joseph Conrad]], a future friend of Crane's, would later write that the novel "detonated... with the impact and force of a twelve-inch shell charged with a very high explosive."<ref name="Dav129"/>  Wanting to capitalize on the success, McClure Syndicate offered Crane a contract to write a series on Civil War battlefields.  Because it was a wish of his to "visit the battlefield&mdash;which I was to describe&mdash;at the time of year when it was fought," Crane agreed to take the assignment.<ref>Davis, p. 138</ref> Visiting battlefields in Northern [[Virginia]], including [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], he would later produce five more Civil War tales: "Three Miraculous Soldiers", "The Veteran", "An Indiana Campaign", "An Episode of War", and "The Little Regiment".<ref>Davis, p. 143</ref>

At the age of twenty-four, Crane, who was reveling in his success, became involved in a highly publicized case involving a suspected prostitute named Dora Clark.  In the early morning hours of September 16, he escorted two chorus girls and Clark from New York City's Broadway Garden, a popular resort where he had interviewed the girls for a series he was writing.<ref>Benfey, p. 175</ref>  As Crane saw one lady safely to a streetcar, a plainclothes policeman arrested the other two girls for [[solicitation]]; Crane was threatened with arrest while attempting to interfere.  One of the girls was released after Crane confirmed her erroneous claim that she was his wife, but Clark was charged and taken to the precinct.  Against advice of the arresting sergeant, Crane made a statement confirming Dora Clark's innocence, stating that "I only know that while with me she acted respectably, and that the policeman's charge was false."<ref>Wertheim, p. 206</ref>  On the basis of Crane's testimony, Clark was discharged.  The media seized upon the story; news spread to Philadelphia, Boston and beyond, with papers focusing on Crane's bravery and courage.<ref>Davis, p. 158</ref>  The Stephen Crane story, as it became known, soon became a source for ridicule, however; the ''Chicago Dispatch'' in particular quipped that "Stephen Crane is respectfully informed that association with women in scarlet is not necessarily a 'Red Badge of Courage'".<ref>Wertheim, p. 208</ref>

A couple weeks after her trial, Clark pressed charges of false arrest against the officer who had arrested her.  The next day, the officer brutally assaulted Clark in the presence of witness for having brought charges against him.  Crane, who initially went briefly to Philadelphia to escape the pressure of publicity, returned to New York to give testimony at Becker's trial despite advice given to him from [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who was Police Commissioner at the time and a new acquaintance of Crane's.<ref>Wertheim, p. 210</ref>  Crane became a target for the defense in that the police raided his apartment and interviewed people who knew him, attempting to find incriminating evidence in order to lessen his testimony.<ref>Davis, p. 163</ref>  A vigorous cross-examination took place that sought to portray Crane as a man of dubious morals.<ref>Benfey, p. 179</ref>  After the trial ended on October 16, the arresting officer was exonerated, but Crane's reputation was ruined.<ref>Davis, p. 167</ref>

===Cora Crane, shipwreck and Greco-Turkish War===
Given $700 in Spanish gold by the Bacheller-Johnson syndicate to work as a war correspondent in [[Cuba]], Crane left New York on November 27 on a train bound for [[Jacksonville, Florida]].<ref>Davis, p. 168</ref>  Upon arrival in Jacksonville, he registered at the St. James Hotel under the alias of Samuel Carleton and managed to keep a low profile while attempting to find means of passage to Cuba.<ref>Wertheim, p. 222</ref>  While waiting for a boat, he toured the city and visited the local [[brothel]]s.  Within days he met 31-year old [[Cora Crane|Cora Taylor]], proprietress of the downtown bawdy house Hotel de Dream.  Born into a respectable Boston family,<ref>Benfey, p. 187</ref> Cora (whose legal name was Cora Ethel Stewart) had already had two brief marriages; her first husband, Vinton Murphy, divorced her on the grounds of adultery.  In 1889, she had married Captain Donald William Stewart, whom she left in 1892 for another man.<ref>Davis, p. 176</ref>  By the time Crane arrived, Cora had been in Jacksonville for two years.  She lived a bohemian lifestyle but was also a well-known and respected local figure.  The two spent much time together while Crane awaited his departure.  He was finally cleared to leave for the Cuban port of Cienfuegas on New Year's Eve aboard the ''Commodore''.<ref>Davis, p. 178</ref>

| style="text-align: left;" | "None of them knew the color of the sky. Their eyes glanced level, and were fastened upon the waves that swept toward them. These waves were of the hue of slate, save for the tops, which were of foaming white, and all of the men knew the colors of the sea."

|}
The ship set sail from Jacksonville with 27 or 28 men and a cargo of supplies and ammunition for the Cuban rebels.<ref>Wertheim, p. 232</ref>  On the [[St. John's River]] and less then two miles from Jacksonville, the ''Commodore'' struck a sandbar in a dense fog and received damage to its hull.  Although towed off the sandbar the following day, it was again beached in [[Mayport]], again receiving damage.<ref>Wertheim, p. 233</ref>  A leak began in the boiler room that evening and as a result of malfunctioning water pumps, the ship came to a standstill about 16 miles from Mosquito Inlet.  As the ship took on more water, Crane described the engine room as resembling "a scene at this time taken from the middle kitchen of [[hades]]."<ref>Wertheim, p. 234</ref>  The ''Commodore'''s lifeboats were lowered in the early hours of the morning on January 2 and the ship ultimately sank at 7:00 a.m.  Crane was one of the last to leave the ship in a 10-foot dinghy.  In an ordeal that he would recount in the novella "[[The Open Boat]]", Crane and three other men (including the ship's Captain) foundered off the coast of Florida for a day and a half before attempting to land the dinghy at [[Daytona Beach]].  The small boat, however, overturned in the surf, forcing the exhausted men to swim to shore; this resulted in the death of one of the men.<ref>Wertheim, p. 236</ref>  Having lost the gold given to him for his journey, Crane wired Cora Taylor for help.  She traveled to Daytona and returned to Jacksonville with Crane the next day, only four days after he had left on the ''Commodore''.<ref>Davis, p. 186</ref>  

The disaster was widely reported, making the front page of newspapers across the country.  Rumors that the ship had been sabotaged were widely circulated but never substantiated.<ref>Davis, p. 187</ref>  Portrayed favorably and heroically by the press, Crane emerged from the ordeal with his reputation enhanced, if not restored, after the battering he received during the Dora Clark affair.  Meanwhile, Crane's affair with Cora Taylor quickly blossomed into a full blown romance.  Despite contentment in Jacksonville and the need for rest after his ordeal, Crane became restless.  He left Jacksonville on January 11 for New York City, where he applied for a passport to Cuba, Mexico and the West Indies.  Spending some three weeks in New York, he completed "The Open Boat" and periodically visited Port Jervis.<ref>Wertheim, p. 240</ref>  By this time, however, blockades had formed along the Florida coast, and Crane came to the conclusion that he would never be able to travel to Cuba. "The Open Boat" was sold to Scribner's for $300 in early March.<ref>Berryman, p. 166</ref>  Determined to work as a war correspondent, Crane signed on with [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s ''New York Journal'' to cover the impending Greco-Turkish conflict.  He brought along Cora, who had sold the Hotel de Dream in order to follow him.<ref>Benfey, p. 202</ref>

On March 20, they sailed first to England, where Crane was warmly received.  They arrived in [[Athens]] in early April; between April 17 (when Turkey declared war on Greece) and April 22, Crane wrote his first published report of the war, "An Impression of the 'Concert'".<ref>Wertheim, p. 249</ref>  When he left for [[Epirus]] in the northwest, Cora remained behind in Athens, where she became the Greek war's first woman war correspondent.  She wrote under the pseudonym "Imogene Carter" for the ''New York Journal'', a job that Crane had secured for her.<ref>Davis, p. 200</ref>  They both wrote frequently, traveling throughout the country separately or otherwise together.  The first large battle that Crane witnessed was the Turks' assault on General Constantine Smolenski's Greek forces as Velestino.  Crane wrote, "It is a great thing to survey the army of the enemy.  Just where and how it takes hold upon the heart is difficult of description."<ref>Davis, p. 204</ref>  It was during this battle that Crane encountered "a fat waddling puppy" that he immediately claimed, dubbing it "Velestino, the Journal dog".<ref>Berryman, p. 178</ref>  An armistice was signed between Greece and Turkey on May 20, ending the thirty-day war; Crane and Cora left Greece for England, bringing two Greek brothers as servants and Velestino the dog with them.<ref>Berryman, p. 184</ref>

===England and Spanish-American War===
After staying in Limpsfield, [[Surrey]] for a few days, Crane and Cora settled in Ravensbrook, a plain brick villa in Oxted.<ref>Wertheim, p. 266</ref>  Referring to themselves as Mr. and Mrs. Crane, the couple lived openly in England, presenting themselves as married.  Crane, however, chose to conceal the relationship from his friends and family.<ref>Davis, p. 219</ref>  While admired in England, Crane thought himself attacked back home: "There seem so many of them in America who want to kill, bury and forget me purely out of unkindness and envy and<U+2014>my unworthiness, if you choose," he wrote.<ref>Davis, p. 225</ref>  Velestino the dog sickened and died soon after their arrival in England, on August 1.  Crane, who had a great love for dogs,<ref>Linson, p. 107</ref> wrote an emotional letter to a friend an hour after the dog's death, stating that "for eleven days we fought death for him, thinking nothing of anything but his life."<ref name="ber188">Berryman, p. 188</ref>  The Limpsfield-Oxted area was home to members of the socialist [[Fabian Society]] and therefore a magnet for writers like [[Edmund Gosse]], [[Ford Maddox Ford]] and [[Edward Garnett]].  Crane also met the Polish-born novelist [[Joseph Conrad]] in October 1897, with whom he would have what Crane called a "warm and endless friendship".<ref>Davis, p. 245</ref>

Although confident amongst peers, Crane's literary reputation was dwindling because of fervent negative reviews of the recently published ''The Third Violet''.  Reviewers were also highly critical of Crane's war letters, deeming them self-centered.<ref>Davis, p. 211</ref>  Although ''The Red Badge of Courage'' had by this time gone through fourteen printings in the United States and six in England, Crane was running out of money.  In order to ensure their livelihood, he worked at a feverish pitch, writing prolifically for both the English and American Market.<ref>Davis, p. 214</ref>  He wrote in quick succession stories such as ''The Monster'', "The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky", "Death and the Child" and "The Blue Hotel".<ref name="ber188"/>  Crane began to attach price tags to his new works of fiction, hoping that "The Bride", for example, would fetch $175.<ref>Davis, p. 223</ref>  As 1897 ended, however, Crane's money crisis worsened.<ref>Davis, p. 236</ref>  Amy Leslie, a reporter from [[Chicago]] and a former lover of his, sued him for $550.<ref>Berryman, p. 205</ref>  The ''New York Times'' reported that Leslie gave him $800 in November 1896, but he had only repaid her a quarter of the sum.<ref>Wertheim, p. 285</ref>  In February, he was served a summons to answer the claim brought against him by Leslie.  The claim, however, was apparently settled out of course as there is no record of adjudication.<ref>Wertheim, p. 290</ref>  Meanwhile, Crane felt "heavy with troubles" and "chased to the wall" by his expenses.<ref>Davis, p. 239</ref>  He confided to his agent that he was some $2,000 in debt, but he was convinced that he would "beat it" with more literary input.<ref>Davis, p. 241<U+2013>242</ref>

[[Image:StephenCraneandCora1899.gif|left|thumb|Crane and Cora in 1899]]
Soon after the ''[[USS Maine (ACR-1)|USS Maine]]'' exploded in the [[Havana Harbor]] on [[February 15]], [[1898]] under suspicious circumstances, Crane attempted to join the Navy but was found physically unfit.<ref>Berryman, p. 217</ref>  Crane's health was failing and it is believed that it is during this time that Crane's [[tuberculosis|pulmonary tuberculosis]] (which he may have contracted in childhood<ref>Davis, p. 273</ref>) became apparent.<ref>Benfey, p. 240</ref>  He was then offered a sixty-pound advance by ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' for articles "from the seat of war in the event of a war breaking out" between the United States and Spain.<ref>Davis, p. 245</ref>  With little to no money coming in from his finished stories, Stephen accepted the assignment and left Oxted for New York.<ref>Wertheim, p. 298</ref>  Cora and the rest of the household stays behind to fend off local creditors.  Crane applied for a passport and left New York for [[Key West]] two days before Congress declared war.  While the war idled, however, he spent his time interviewing people and turning out occasional copy.<ref>Davis, p. 248</ref>  In early June, he had an opportunity to witness the establishment of a protected American base in Cuba when Marines seized [[Guantanamo Bay]].<ref>Berryman, p. 221</ref>  He then went ashore with the Marines, planning "to gather impressions and write them as the spirit moved."<ref>Davis, p. 252</ref>  Although he would write honestly about his fear in battle, others observed his calmness and composure.  He would later recall "this prolonged tragedy of the night" in the war tale "Marines Signaling Under Fire at Guantanamo".<ref>Davis, p. 253</ref>  After showing a willingness to serve during fighting at Cuzco by carrying messages to company commanders, Crane was officially cited for his "material aid during the action".<ref>Davis, p. 254</ref>  

He continued to report upon various battles and the worsening military conditions; he also made his admiration for Theodore Roosevelt's [[Rough Riders]] known despite past tensions with the Commissioner.  In early July, however, Crane suffered from a high fever and was sent to the United States for medical treatment.<ref>Davis, p. 267</ref>  He was diagnosed with [[yellow fever]], then [[malaria]].<ref>Benfey, p. 251</ref>  Upon arrival in [[Old Point Comfort]], [[Virginia]], he spent the next few weeks resting in a hotel.  Although Crane had filed more than twenty dispatches in the three months he had covered the war, the ''World'''s business manager believed that the paper had not received its money's worth and promptly fired him.<ref>Davis, p. 270</ref>  In retaliation, Crane signed with Hearst's ''New York Journal'' with the wish to return to Cuba.  He traveled first to [[Puerto Rico]] and then to Havana.  In September, rumors began to spread that Crane, who was laying low, had either been killed or had simply disappeared.<ref>Davis, p. 282</ref>  He nonetheless sporadically sent out dispatches and stories; he wrote about the mood in Havana, the crowded city sidewalks, and other various topics, but he was soon desperate for money again.  Cora, left alone in England, was also penniless.  She became frantic with worry over her lover's whereabouts, however, since they were not in direct communication until the end of the year.<ref>Davis, p. 288</ref>  Crane finally left Havana and arrived back in England on [[January 11]], [[1899]].

===Death===
[[Image:StephenCrane1899.jpg|thumb|Crane in 1899]]
Rent on Ravensbrook had not been paid for a year.  Upon returning to England, Crane secured a solicitor to act as guarantor for their debts, after which Crane and Cora relocated to Brede Place.<ref>Wertheim, p. 361</ref>  This manor in Sussex, which dated to the fourteenth century and had neither electricity nor indoor plumbing,<ref>Davis, p. 292</ref> was offered to them by friends at a modest rent.<ref>Benfey, p. 257</ref>  The relocation seemingly gave Crane hope, but financial difficulties continued to follow him.  Deciding that he could no longer afford to write for American publications, he concentrated on publishing in English magazines instead.<ref>Davis, p. 294</ref>  

Crane pushed himself to write feverishly during the first months at Brede; he related to his publisher that he was "doing more work now than I have at any other period in my life".<ref>Davis, p. 296</ref>  His health became continuously worse, and by the fall of 1899 he was asking friends about various health resorts.<ref>Benfey, p. 262</ref>  ''The Monster and Other Stories'' was in production and ''War Is Kind'', his second collection of poems, was published in the United States in May.  None of his books after ''The Red Badge of Courage'' had sold well, however, and he bought a typewriter in order to spur output.  ''Active Service'', a novella based on Crane's correspondence experience, was published in October to mixed reviews.  The ''New York Times'' reviewer in particular questioned "whether the author of 'Active Service' himself really sees anything remarkable in his newspapery hero."<ref>Wertheim, p. 408</ref>

In December, the Cranes held an elaborate Christmas party at Brede, attended by Joseph Conrad, [[Henry James]], [[H. G. Wells]] and other friends, that spanned several days.<ref>Benfey, p. 268</ref>  On December 29, Crane suffered a severe hemorrhage of the lungs.  In January 1900 he had recovered sufficiently to work on a new novel, ''The O'Ruddy'', completing 25 of the 33 chapters.  Although plans were made for him to travel as a correspondent to [[Gibraltar]] to write sketches from Saint Helena, the site of a [[Second Boer War|Boer]] prison,<ref>Wertheim, p. 401</ref> at the end of March and in early April he suffered two more massive hemorrhages.<ref>Wertheim, p. 428</ref>  Cora took over most of Crane's correspondence while he was ill, writing to friends for monetary assistance.  The couple planned on traveling to the continent, but Conrad, upon visiting Crane for the last time, remarked upon his friend's "wasted face [that] was enough to tell me that it was the most forlorn of all hopes."<ref>Wertheim, p. 441</ref>  

On May 28, Crane and Cora arrived at [[Badenweiler]], [[Germany]], a health spa situated near the [[Black Forest]].  Despite his weakened condition, Crane continued to dictate fragmentary episodes for the completion of ''The O'Ruddy''.<ref>Wertheim, p. 442</ref>  He died on [[June 5]], [[1900]] at the age of twenty-eight.  In his will he left everything to Cora,<ref>Benfey, p. 271</ref> who brought his body back to New York for burial.  Crane was interred in the [[Evergreen Cemetery (Hillside, New Jersey)|Evergreen Cemetery]] in what is now [[Hillside, New Jersey]].<ref>Wertheim, p. 363</ref>  The granite tombstone simply reads: "Stephen Crane <U+2013> Poet <U+2013> Author <U+2013> 1871<U+2013>1900".<ref>Knapp, p. 35</ref>

==Fiction and poetry==
===Literary genre===
Stephen Crane's fiction is typically categorized as either [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]], [[literary realism|Realism]], [[Impressionism (literature)|Impressionism]] or a mixture of the three genres.  The critic Sergio Perosa, for example, wrote in his essay "Stephen Crane fra naturalismo e impressionismo" that the author's work presented a "symbiosis" of Naturalistic ideals and Impressionistic methods.<ref>Nagel, p. 8</ref>  Critics tend to cite similarities between the stylistic techniques in Crane's writing and impressionist painting&mdash;including the use of color and [[chiaroscuro]]&mdash;to support the theory that Crane was not only an impressionist but also influenced by the movement itself.<ref>Rogers, p. 292</ref>

Whereas ''Maggie: A Girl of the Street'' is often considered one of the first works of American Naturalism,<ref>Bassan, p. 3</ref> ''The Red Badge of Courage'' was and sometimes is considered by critics a work of Realism despite the fact that it was completed before Crane had any firsthand knowledge of war.<ref>Nagel, p. 36</ref>  Although there being no evidence that Crane formulated a precise theory of his craft, he vehemently rejected sentimentality, asserting that "a story should be logical in its action and faithful to character.  Truth to life itself was the only test, the greatest artists were the simplest, and simple because they were true."<ref>Nagel, p. 18</ref>

===Style and technique===
Poet and biographer [[John Berryman]] suggested that there were three basic variations, or "norms", of Crane's narrative style.<ref>Bergon, p. 2</ref>  The first, being "flexible, swift, abrupt and nervous", is best exemplified in ''The Red Badge of Courage'', while the second ("supple majesty") is believed to relate to "The Open Boat" and the third ("much more closed, circumstantial and 'normal' in feeling and syntax') to later stories such as "The Monster"<ref>Berryman, p 284</ref>  Crane's work, however, cannot be determined by style solely on chronology or style.  Not only does his fiction not take place in any particular region with similar characters, but it varies from serious in tone to reportorial writing and light fiction.<ref>Gibson, p. 146</ref>  Crane's writing, however, is consistently driven by immediacy and is at once concentrated, vivid and intense.<ref>Bergon, p. 5</ref>  His fiction also contains poetic characteristics such as shorthand prose, suggestibility, shifts in perspective, and ellipses between and within sentences.<ref>Bergon, p. 26</ref>  Similarly, omission plays a large part in Crane's work; the names of his protagonists are not commonly used and sometimes they are not named at all.<ref>Bloom, p. 5</ref>  At the time, scholars criticized his work for the frequent incorporation of everyday speech into the dialogue, mimicking the regional accents of his characters with colloquial stylization.<ref>Bergon, p. 6</ref>

Crane's poems, which he preferred to call "lines", are typically not given as much scholarly attention as his fiction; no anthology contained Crane's verse until 1926.<ref>Hoffman, p. 64</ref>  Although it is not certain when Crane began to seriously write poetry, he once stated that his overall poetic aim was "to give my ideas of life as a whole, so far as I know it".<ref name="berg25">Bergon, p. 25</ref>  The poetic style used in both of his books of poetry, ''The Black Riders and Other Lines'' and ''War is Kind'', was unconventional for the time in that it was written in [[free verse]] without [[rhyme]], [[meter]] (like [[iambic pentameter]]) or even titles for individual works.  They are typically short in length and although several poems, like "Do not weep, maiden, for war is kind", use stanzas and refrains, most of them do not.<ref>Hoffman, p. 62</ref>  Crane also differed from his peers and poets of later generations in that he heavily used [[allegory]], [[dialectic]] and narrative situations.<ref>Hoffman, p. 65</ref>

Critic Ruth Miller claimed that Crane wrote "an intellectual poetry rather than a poetry that evokes feeling, a poetry that stimulates the mind rather than arouses the heart".<ref name="berg25"/>  In the most complexly organized poems, the significance of the states of mind or feelings is ambiguous, but Crane's poems tend to affirm certain elemental attitudes, beliefs, opinions and stances toward God, man and the universe.<ref name="berg25"/>  ''The Black Riders'' in particular is essentially a dramatic concept and the poems provide continuity within the dramatic structure.  There is also a dramatic interplay in which there is frequently a major voice reporting an incident seen ("In the desert / I saw a creature, naked, bestial") or experienced ("A learned man came to me once").  The second voice or additional voices represent a point of view which is revealed to be inferior; when these clash, a dominant attitude emerges. <ref>Katz, p. xxxv</ref>  

===Major themes===
Crane's work is often thematically driven by Naturalistic and Realistic concerns.  These themes include ideals versus realities, spiritual crises, and fear, which involves courage, cowardice and conflict of war.<ref>Gullason, p. 60</ref>  These themes are particularly evident in Crane's first three novels, ''Maggie: A Girl of the Streets'' ''The Red Badge of Courage'' and ''George's Mother''.  The three main characters search for a way to make their dreams come true, but ultimately suffer from crises of identity.<ref>Gullason, p. 61</ref>  Regarding the theme of fear and the dichotomy of courage and cowardice, this is clearly represented in ''The Red Badge of Courage'' in which the main character, Henry Fleming, longs for the heroics of battle but ultimately fears it.  Therefore, there is the threat of death, misery and the loss of self.<ref>Shulman, p. 444</ref>

Extreme isolation from society and community is also a heavily utilized theme in Crane's work.  During the most intense battle scenes in ''The Red Badge of Courage'', for example, the story's focus is predominately "on the inner responses of a self unaware of others".<ref>Shulman, p. 442</ref>  In "The Open Boat", "An Experiment in Misery" and other short stories, Crane uses experiments with light, motion and color to express different degrees of epistemological uncertainty.<ref>Shulman, p. 443</ref>

==Legacy==
[[Image:StephenCrane-PortJervisMarker.jpg|thumb|Historical marker in [[Port Jervis, New York]] commemorating Crane]]
During the two decades following his death, Stephen Crane and his work were nearly forgotten.  It was not until Thomas Beer published his biography in 1923, which was then followed by editor Wilson Follett's ''The Work of Stephen Crane'' (1925&ndash;1927), that Crane's writing became available to a scholarly audience.<ref>Cazemajou, p. 5</ref>  At the time, Crane's reputation was enhanced by faithful support from friends such as Joseph Conrad, H. G. Wells and Ford Maddox Ford, all who either published recollections of their time with Crane or otherwise commented upon it openly.  John Berryman's 1950 biography of Crane established the author as an American classic.  Since 1951 there has been a steady outpouring of articles, monographs and reprints in Crane scholarship.<ref>Cazemajou, p. 6</ref>  

Crane's peers, including Conrad and James, as well as later writers such as [[Robert Frost]], [[Ezra Pound]] and [[Willa Cather]], hailed Crane as one of the finest creative spirits of his time.<ref>Knapp, p. 2</ref> His work was described by Wells as "the first expression of the opening mind of a new period, or, at least, the early emphatic phase of a new initiative."<ref>Knapp, p. 1</ref>  His work has also proved inspirational for future authors; scholars have drawn similarities between [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'' and ''The Red Badge of Courage'', for example.<ref>Stallman, p. 176</ref>  Today, Crane is remembered mainly for ''The Red Badge'', which is heralded as an American classic.  The novel was adapted into a successful 1951 [[The Red Badge of Courage (film)|film of the same name]] by [[John Huston]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043961/ | title=The Red Badge of Courage (1951) | accessdate=2008-07-21 | publisher=IMDb }}</ref>  Crane is today considered one of the most innovative writers of the 1890s.<ref name="ben3"/>
