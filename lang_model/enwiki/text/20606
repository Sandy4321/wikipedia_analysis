'''''Jurassic Park''''' is a 1993 American [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[action film]] directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] and the first of the [[Jurassic Park (franchise)|''Jurassic Park'' franchise]]. It is based on the 1990 [[Jurassic Park (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Michael Crichton]], with a screenplay written by Crichton and [[David Koepp]]. It stars [[Sam Neill]], [[Laura Dern]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Richard Attenborough]], [[Ariana Richards]], [[Joseph Mazzello]], [[Martin Ferrero]], [[Wayne Knight]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and [[Bob Peck]]. The film centers on the fictional Isla Nublar, an islet located off [[Costa Rica]]'s Pacific Coast, where a billionaire philanthropist and a small team of genetic scientists have created a [[Animal theme park|wildlife park]] of [[cloning|cloned]] [[dinosaur]]s.

Before Crichton's book was published, four studios put in bids to acquire the film rights. Spielberg, with the backing of [[Universal Studios]], acquired the rights for $1.5 million before publication in 1990, and Crichton was hired for an additional $500,000 to adapt the novel for the screen. David Koepp wrote the final draft, which left out much of the novel's exposition and violence and made numerous changes to the characters. Filming took place in California and Hawaii between August and November 1992, and post-production rolled until May 1993, being supervised by Spielberg in Poland as he filmed ''[[Schindler's List]]''. The dinosaurs were created through groundbreaking [[computer-generated imagery]] by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] in conjunction with life-sized [[animatronic]] dinosaurs built by [[Stan Winston]]'s team. To showcase the film's sound design, which included a mixture of various animal noises for the dinosaur roars, Spielberg invested in the creation of [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]], a company specializing in digital [[surround sound]] formats.

Following an extensive $65 million marketing campaign, which included licensing deals with 100 companies, ''Jurassic Park'' grossed over $900 million worldwide in its original theatrical run. It surpassed Spielberg's 1982 film ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' to become the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] at the time (a distinction it would yield to ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' four years later). The film was well received by critics, who praised it for its special effects and Spielberg's direction but criticized the writing. The film won more than 20 awards (including 3 [[Academy Award]]s), mostly for its visual effects. Following a [[3D film|3D]] re-release in 2013 to celebrate its 20th anniversary, ''Jurassic Park''{{'}}s total gross eclipsed $1 billion, making it the 17th film to do so. It currently ranks as the 13th-highest-grossing film worldwide, the [[List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States#Not adjusted for inflation|16th-highest-grossing film in North America]] (unadjusted for inflation), and the highest-grossing film released by Universal and directed by Spielberg. ''Jurassic Park'' is considered by many as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest science fiction films ever made]], as well as a landmark in the vector of visual effects, in regards to computer-generated imagery and animatronics. The film was followed by two sequels, ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'' and ''[[Jurassic Park III]]'', which both became box office successes but received a mixed critical response. A fourth film entitled ''[[Development of Jurassic World|Jurassic World]]'' is scheduled for release in 2015.

==Plot==
[[List of Jurassic Park characters#John Hammond|John Hammond]] ([[Richard Attenborough]]), the founder and CEO of [[bioengineering]] company InGen, has created a [[Animal theme park|theme park]] called Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar, a tropical island near [[Costa Rica]], populated with cloned [[dinosaur]]s. After a park worker is killed by a ''[[Velociraptor]]'', the park's investors, represented by the lawyer Donald Gennaro ([[Martin Ferrero]]), demand that experts visit the park and certify it as safe. Gennaro invites the mathematician Ian Malcolm ([[Jeff Goldblum]]) while Hammond invites paleontologist  Dr. Alan Grant ([[Sam Neill]]) and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler ([[Laura Dern]]). Upon arrival on Isla Nublar, the group is stunned to see a ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' and a herd of ''[[Parasaurolophus]]'' in the distance.

At the visitor center, the crew learns through an explanatory video and a tour through a laboratory that the cloning was accomplished by extracting the DNA of dinosaurs from [[mosquito]]es that had been preserved in [[amber]]. However, the strands of DNA were incomplete, so DNA from frogs was used to fill in the gaps. The dinosaurs were all cloned genetically as females in order to prevent breeding.

The group is then joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Lex and Tim Murphy ([[Ariana Richards]] and [[Joseph Mazzello]]) for a tour of the park, while Hammond oversees the trip from the park's control room. However, the tour does not go as planned, with most of the dinosaurs failing to appear and a ''[[Triceratops]]'' becoming ill. As a tropical storm approaches Isla Nublar, most of the park employees depart on a boat for the mainland and the visitors return to the electric tour vehicles, except Ellie, who stays with the park's veterinarian to study the ''Triceratops''.

During the storm, Jurassic Park's computer programmer, Dennis Nedry ([[Wayne Knight]]), who has secretly been paid by a corporate rival to steal dinosaur embryos, deactivates the park's security system to allow him access to the embryo storage room. Most of the park's electric fences are deactivated, leading the ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' to attack the tour group.  Grant, Lex, and Tim narrowly escape while the ''T. Rex'' devours Gennaro and injures Malcolm. On his way to deliver the embryos to the island's docks, Nedry becomes lost, crashes his Jeep, and is killed by a ''[[Dilophosaurus]]''.

Ellie assists the park's game warden, Robert Muldoon ([[Bob Peck]]), in a search for survivors, but they only find Malcolm before the ''Tyrannosaurus'' returns and chases them in one of the vehicles, and ultimately fails to catch them. Unable to decipher Nedry's code to reactivate the security system, Hammond and the park's chief engineer Ray Arnold ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]) opt to reboot the park's computer and electrical network. The group shuts down the park's grid and retreats to an emergency bunker, while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the process of rebooting the system. When he fails to return, Ellie and Muldoon head to the shed themselves. They discover the shutdown has disabled the remaining fences and released the ''Velociraptors''; Muldoon distracts the raptors while Ellie turns the power back on, discovering the severed arm of Arnold afterwards. Soon after, the raptors ambush and kill Muldoon.

Alone in the park, Grant, Tim, and Lex discover the broken shells of dinosaur eggs. Grant concludes that this means the dinosaurs have been breeding, which occurred because they have the genetic coding of frog DNA<U+2014>[[African bullfrog|West African bullfrogs]] [[Sequential hermaphroditism|can change their gender in a single-sex environment]], which the dinosaurs were able to do as well. On the way back to the visitor center the trio encounter a herd of ''[[Gallimimus]]'' when suddenly the ''Tyrannosaurus'' appears out of the jungle and kills one. Grant, Tim, and Lex reach the visitor center, and Grant leaves them there as he goes searching for the others. After finding the bunker, Grant and Ellie head back to the visitor center, where the children are being attacked by two ''Velociraptors''. The four head to the control room and Lex restores full power, which allows the group to call for rescue. While trying to leave, Grant's group is cornered by the raptors but escapes when the ''Tyrannosaurus'' suddenly appears and kills both raptors. Hammond arrives driving a Jeep carrying Malcolm, and the entire group flees together. Before they board a [[helicopter]] to leave the island, Grant says he will not endorse the park, a choice with which Hammond concurs.

===Development===
[[File:MichaelCrichton 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Michael Crichton]]'s book attracted the attention of director Steven Spielberg even before publishing. The author was also responsible for the film's first scripts.|alt=Michael Crichton wearing a suit.]] 
[[Michael Crichton]] originally conceived a [[screenplay]] about a graduate student who recreates a dinosaur; he continued to wrestle with his fascination with dinosaurs and cloning until he began writing the novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]''.<ref>{{cite video | people = Crichton, Michael | title = Michael Crichton on the Jurassic Park Phenomenon | medium = DVD | publisher = Universal | date = 2001}}</ref> Even before publication, [[Steven Spielberg]] learned of the novel in October 1989 while he and Crichton were discussing a screenplay that would become the television series ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.<ref name="mcbride">[[Joseph McBride (writer)|McBride, Joseph]] (1997). ''Steven Spielberg''. Faber and Faber, 416<U+2013>9. ISBN 0-571-19177-0</ref> Spielberg considered that what really fascinated him was that ''Jurassic Park'' was "a really credible look at how dinosaurs might be someday be brought back alongside modern mankind", going beyond a simple monster movie.<ref name=dawn>"Return to Jurassic Park: Dawn of a New Era", ''Jurassic Park'' Blu-Ray (2011)</ref>

Before the book was published, Crichton demanded a non-negotiable fee of $1.5 million as well as a substantial percentage of the gross. [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Tim Burton]], [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] and [[Richard Donner]], and [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Joe Dante]] bid for the rights,<ref name="mcbride" /> but [[Universal Studios]] eventually acquired them in May 1990 for Spielberg.<ref name="Production notes">DVD Production Notes</ref>  After completing ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', Spielberg wanted to film ''[[Schindler's List]]''. [[Music Corporation of America]] (then Universal Pictures' parent company) president [[Sid Sheinberg]] gave a green light to the film on the condition that Spielberg made ''Jurassic Park'' first.<ref name="mcbride" /> The director later declared that by choosing a creature-driven thriller, "I was really just trying to make a good sequel to ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', on land."<ref>McBride, p. 418.</ref>

To create the dinosaurs, Spielberg at first thought of hiring [[Bob Gurr]], who designed a giant mechanical [[King Kong]] for [[Universal Studios Hollywood]]'s [[King Kong Encounter]]. Upon considering that the life-sized dinosaurs would be too expensive and not all convincing, Spielberg instead decided to look after the best effects supervisors in Hollywood. Brought in were [[Stan Winston]] to create the [[animatronics|animatronic]] dinosaurs, [[Phil Tippett]] to create [[go motion]] dinosaurs for [[long shot]]s, [[Michael Lantieri]] to supervise the on-set effects, and [[Dennis Muren]] of [[Industrial Light & Magic]] to do the [[digital compositing]]. Paleontologist [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)|Jack Horner]] supervised the designs, to help fulfill Spielberg's desire to portray the dinosaurs as animals rather than monsters. This led to the entry of certain concepts about dinosaurs, such as the theory that dinosaurs [[Origin of birds|evolved into birds]] and had very little in common with lizards. One of the first consequences was the removal of the raptors' flicking tongues in Tippett's early [[animatics]],<ref name="Earl doc">{{cite video | title = The Making of Jurassic Park <U+2014> Hosted by James Earl Jones | medium = VHS | publisher = Universal |date = 1995}}</ref> as Horner complained it was implausible.<ref name="French">French, Lawrence. ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' Magazine, Vol.24, No.2, pg. 9, "Jurassic Park: Dinosaur Movements"</ref> Winston's department created fully detailed models of the dinosaurs before molding [[latex]] skins, which were fitted over complex robotics. Tippett created stop-motion animatics of both the raptors in the kitchen and the ''Tyrannosaurus'' attacking the car. But despite go motion's attempts at [[motion blur]]s, Spielberg still found the end results unsatisfactory in terms of working in a [[live-action]] feature film. Muren declared to Spielberg that he thought the dinosaurs could be built through [[computer-generated imagery]], and the director asked him to prove it.<ref name="Earl doc" /> ILM animators [[Mark A.Z. Dipp<U+00E9>|Mark Dipp<U+00E9>]] and Steve Williams developed a computer-generated walk cycle for the ''T. rex'' skeleton, and were approved to do more.<ref>Shay, Duncan, p. 49.</ref> When Spielberg and Tippett saw an animatic of the ''T. rex'' chasing a herd of ''Gallimimus'', Spielberg said, "You're out of a job," to which Tippett replied, "Don't you mean extinct?"<ref name="Earl doc" /> Spielberg later wrote both the animatic and his dialogue between him and Tippett into the script, as a conversation between Malcolm and Grant.<ref name="gallies">Shay, Duncan, p. 134<U+2013>5.</ref> Although no go motion was used, Tippett and his animators were still used by the production to supervise dinosaur movement. Tippett acted as a consultant regarding dinosaur anatomy, and his stop motion animators were re-trained as computer animators.<ref name="Earl doc" /> The animatics made by Tippett's team were also used along with the  [[storyboard]]s as a reference for what would be shot during the action sequences.<ref name=pre>"Return to Jurassic Park: Making Prehistory", ''Jurassic Park'' Blu-Ray (2011)</ref> ILM's artists were sent to private tours to the local animal park so they could study large animals <U+2014> rhinos, elephants, alligators, and giraffes <U+2014> up close, and also received [[mime]] classes for understanding movements.<ref name=back/>

===Writing===
Universal paid Crichton a further $500,000 to adapt his own novel,<ref>{{cite news | title = Leaping Lizards | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = December 7, 1990 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318785,00.html | accessdate=February 17, 2007 | first=Tim | last=Appelo}}</ref> which he had finished by the time Spielberg was filming ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]''. Crichton noted that because the book was "fairly long" his script only had about 10 to 20 percent of the novel's content; scenes were dropped for budgetary and practical reasons, and despite the gory descriptions, the violence was toned down.<ref name="Biodrowski">Biodrowski, Steve. "[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/1993/08/jurassic-park-michael-crichton-on-adapting-his-novel-to-the-screen/ JURASSIC PARK: Michael Crichton on Adapting his Novel to the Screen]".

As Spielberg wanted another writer to rework the script, Universal president [[Casey Silver]] recommended him [[David Koepp]], co-writer of ''[[Death Becomes Her]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Backstory 5: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1990s|author=McGilligan, Patrick|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|ISBN=0520251059}}</ref> Koepp started afresh from Marmo's draft, and used Spielberg's idea of a cartoon shown to the visitors to remove much of the exposition that fills Crichton's novel.<ref name="koepp">Shay, Duncan, p. 55<U+2013>6.</ref> While Koepp tried to avert excessive character detail "because whenever they started talking about their personal lives, you couldn't care less",<ref>{{cite journal|title=A World Apart|author=Biskind, Peter|journal=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]|date=May 1997}}</ref> he tried to flesh out the characters and make for a more colorful cast, with moments such as Malcolm flirting with Satler leading to Grant's jealousy.<ref name=dawn/> Some [[characterization]]s were changed from the novel. Hammond went from a ruthless businessman to a kindly old man, because Spielberg identified with Hammond's obsession with showmanship.<ref name="lack of story?">McBride, p. 421<U+2013>422.</ref> He also switched the characters of Tim and Lex; in the book, Tim is aged eleven and interested in computers, and Lex is only seven or eight and interested in sports. Spielberg did this because he wanted to work with the younger Joseph Mazzello, and it also allowed him to introduce the sub-plot of Lex's adolescent crush on Grant.<ref name="casting">Shay, Duncan, p.70.</ref> Koepp changed Grant's relationship with the children, making him hostile to them initially to allow for more character development.<ref name="mcbride" />

Two scenes from the book were excised, with Spielberg removing the opening sequence with ''[[Procompsognathus]]'' attacking young children as he found it too horrific,<ref>{{cite news | title = A Tale Of Two 'Jurassics' | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = June 18, 1993 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,306930,00.html | accessdate = February 17, 2007}}</ref> and Koepp cutting for budgetary reasons the ''T. rex'' chasing Grant and the children down a river before being tranquilized by Muldoon. Both parts eventually saw inclusion in the film sequels.<ref name="koepp" /> In turn, Spielberg suggested the addition of the scene where the ''T. rex'' pursues a jeep, which at first would only have the characters driving away after listening to the dinosaur's footsteps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/david-koepp-13615|title=David Koepp: Writer's block|date=September 8, 1999|work=[[The A.V.

===Filming===

After 25 months of pre-production, filming began on August 24, 1992, on the [[Hawaii]]an island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]].<ref>Shay, Duncan, p. 65 and 67.</ref> While [[Costa Rica]] was considered as a location given it is the story's setting, Spielberg's concerns on infrastructure and accessibility made him choose a place where he had already worked before.<ref name=dawn /> The three-week shoot involved various daytime exteriors for Isla Sorna's forests.<ref name="Production notes" /> On September 11, [[Hurricane Iniki]] passed directly over Kaua{{okina}}i, which caused the crew to lose a day of shooting.<ref>Shay, Duncan, p. 86.</ref> Several of the storm scenes from the movie are actual footage shot during the hurricane. The scheduled shoot of the ''Gallimimus'' chase was moved to [[Kualoa Ranch]] on the island of [[Oahu]] and one of the beginning scenes had to be created by digitally animating a still shot of scenery.<ref name="gallies" /> Additional scenes were filmed on the "forbidden island" of [[Niihau]].<ref name="greenie">{{cite web |title= Hawaii Plantsman Confounds Greenies; Keith Robinson has a green thumb with endangered plants and a belief that the 'green' tactics used by the environmental establishment are a total waste of time |date= February 18, 2003 |author= Eric P.

The crew moved to [[Warner Bros. Studios]]' Stage 16 to shoot the ''T. rex''{{'s}} attack on the SUVs.<ref name="triple cite" /> Shooting proved frustrating due to water soaking the foam rubber skin of the animatronic dinosaur, which caused the animatronic ''T. rex'' to shake and quiver from the extra weight when the foam absorbed the water. This forced Stan Winston's crew to dry the model with [[shammy]]s between takes.<ref name="big fan">Shay, Duncan, p. 110<U+2013>1.</ref> On the set, Malcolm distracting the dinosaur with a flare was included at Jeff Goldblum's suggestion, as he felt a heroic action was better than going by the script, where like Gennaro, Malcolm would get scared and run away.<ref name=pre/> The ripples in the glass of water caused by the ''T. rex''{{'}}s footsteps was inspired by Spielberg listening to [[Earth, Wind and Fire]] in his car, and the vibrations the bass rhythm caused. Lantieri was unsure of how to create the shot until the night before filming, when he put a glass of water on a guitar he was playing, which achieved the concentric circles in the water Spielberg wanted. The next morning, guitar strings were put inside the car and a man on the floor plucked the strings to achieve the effect.<ref>{{cite news|title=The 200 things that rocked our world|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=February 2006|page=131}}</ref> Back at Universal, the crew filmed scenes with the ''Dilophosaurus'' on Stage 27.

===Post-production===
Special effects work continued on the film, with Tippett's unit adjusting to new technology with Dinosaur Input Devices:<ref name="SIGCHI Dinosaur Input Device">{{cite web | url=http://www.sigchi.org/chi95/proceedings/papers/bk_bdy.htm | title=Dinosaur Input Device | author=Knep, Brian | coauthors=Hayes, Craig; Sayre, Rick; Williams, Tom | year=1995 | work=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | pages=304<U+2013>309}}</ref> models which fed information into the computers to allow themselves to animate the characters like stop motion puppets. In addition, they acted out scenes with the raptors and ''Gallimimus''. As well as the computer-generated dinosaurs, ILM also created elements such as water splashing and digital face replacement for Ariana Richards' stunt double.<ref name="Earl doc" /> Compositing the dinosaurs onto the live action scenes took around an hour.

Along with the digital effects, Spielberg wanted the film to be the first with digital sound.

===Music===
{{Main|Jurassic Park (film score)}}

Despite the title of the film referencing the [[Jurassic]] period, most of the dinosaurs featured did not exist until the [[Cretaceous]] period, with the exception of ''Brachiosaurus'' and ''Dilophosaurus'', both of which lived in the Jurassic period.<ref name="dinomania">{{cite news | author = [[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould, Stephen]] | title = Dinomania | publisher = The New York Review of Books | date = August 12, 1993 | url =http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1993/aug/12/dinomania/ | accessdate=April 2, 2007}}</ref> The screenplay acknowledges this when Dr. Grant describes the ferocity of the ''Velociraptor'' to a young boy, saying "Try to imagine yourself in the Cretaceous period..."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressherald.com/life/go/dino-mite_2013-04-04.html?pagenum=full|title=Movies: Dino-mite!

* ''Velociraptor'' has a major role and it is also the main villain. The animal's depiction was not based on the actual dinosaur genus in question (which itself was significantly smaller).

* ''Dilophosaurus'' was also very different from its real-life counterpart, made significantly smaller to make sure audiences did not confuse it with the raptors.<ref>Shay, Duncan, p. 36.</ref> Its [[neck frill]] and its ability to spit venom are fictitious. Its vocal sounds were made by combining a [[swan]], a [[hawk]], a [[howler monkey]], and a [[rattlesnake]].<ref name="Earl doc" /> The animatronic model, nicknamed "Spitter" by Stan Winston's team, was animated by the puppeteers sitting on a trench in the set floor, and used a [[paintball]] mechanism to spit the mixture of [[Methyl cellulose|methacyl]] and [[K-Y Jelly]] that served as venom.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stanwinstonschool.com/blog/making-jurassic-park-dilophosaurus-aka-spitter|title=JURASSIC PARK's Spitter - Building the animatronic Dilophosaurus dinosaur puppet|publisher=Stan Winston School of Character Arts|date=2013-04-05|accessdate=2014-01-06}}</ref>
* ''Brachiosaurus'' is the first dinosaur seen by the park's visitors. It is inaccurately depicted as chewing its food, and standing up on its hind legs to browse among the high tree branches.<ref name="the end" /> According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the chewing was done to make the animal seem docile, in a way it resembled a cow chewing its cud. The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stanwinstonschool.com/blog/rehearsing-jurassic-park-brachiosaurus-puppet|title=JURASSIC PARK's Brachiosaurus Animatronic Puppet Rehearsal|publisher=Stan Winston School of Character Arts|date=2013-01-23|accessdate=2014-01-06}}</ref> Despite scientific evidence of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with [[whale sound|whale songs]] and [[donkey]] calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded to be used in the noises of the dinosaurs.<ref name="the end" />
* ''Triceratops'' has an extended cameo, being sick with an unidentified disease. Its appearance was a particular logistical nightmare for Stan Winston when Spielberg asked to shoot the animatronic of the sick creature earlier than expected.<ref>Shay, Duncan, p. 83.</ref> The model, operated by eight puppeteers in the Kaua'i set, wound up being the first dinosaur filmed during production.<ref name=dawn/> Winston also created a baby ''Triceratops'' for Ariana Richards to ride in, a scene cut from the film for pacing reasons.<ref>Shay, Duncan, p. 64.</ref> Gary Rydstrom combined the sound of himself breathing into a cardboard tube with the cows near his workplace at [[Skywalker Ranch]] to create the ''Triceratops'' vocals.<ref name=vult />
* ''Gallimimus'' are featured in a stampede scene where one of them is devoured by the ''Tyrannosaurus''. The ''Gallimimus'' was the first dinosaur to receive a digital version, being featured in two ILM tests, first as a herd of skeletons and then fully skinned while pursued by the ''T. rex''.<ref name="Earl doc" /> Its design was based on [[ostrich]]es, and to emphasize the birdlike qualities, the animation focused mostly on the herd than individual animals.<ref>Shay, Duncan, p. 135.</ref> As reference for the dinosaurs' run, the animators were filmed running at the ILM parking lot, with plastic pipes standing in as the tree that the ''Gallimimus'' jump over.<ref name=next/> The footage even inspired to incorporate an animal falling in its leap as one of the artists crashed making the jump.<ref name=back>{{cite web|url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/welcome-back-to-jurassic-park/|title=Welcome (back) to Jurassic Park|first=Ian|last=Failes|publisher=FX Guide|date=April 4, 2013|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref> Horse squeals became the ''Gallimimus'' sounds.<ref name=vult>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/04/how-the-dino-sounds-in-jurassic-park-were-made.html|date=2013-09-04|title=You<U+2019>ll Never Guess How the Dinosaur Sounds in Jurassic Park Were Made|work=Vulture|first=Kyle|last=Buchanan|accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref>

[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it "a true movie milestone, presenting awe- and fear-inspiring sights never before seen on the screen<U+2026> On paper, this story is tailor-made for Mr. Spielberg's talents<U+2026>[but] [i]t becomes less crisp on screen than it was on the page, with much of the enjoyable jargon either mumbled confusingly or otherwise thrown away."<ref>{{cite news | author=[[Janet Maslin|Maslin, Janet]] | title = Screen Stars With Teeth To Spare | publisher = The New York Times | date = June 11, 1993 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F0CE1D71E3DF932A25755C0A965958260&scp=1&sq=Screen%2520Stars%2520With%2520Teeth%2520To%2520Spare&st=cse | accessdate = February 4, 2007}}</ref> In ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] described the film as "colossal entertainment<U+2014>the eye-popping, mind-bending, kick-out-the-jams thrill ride of summer and probably the year [...] Compared with the dinos, the characters are dry bones, indeed. Crichton and co-screenwriter David Koepp have flattened them into nonentities on the trip from page to screen."<ref>{{cite news | author=[[Peter Travers|Travers, Peter]] | title = Jurassic Park | publisher = Rolling Stone | date = June 1993| url = http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949029/review/5949030/jurassic_park| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070824034910/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949029/review/5949030/jurassic_park| archivedate = August 24, 2007 | accessdate = February 4, 2007}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] noted, "The movie delivers all too well on its promise to show us dinosaurs. We see them early and often, and they are indeed a triumph of special effects artistry, but the movie is lacking other qualities that it needs even more, such as a sense of awe and wonderment, and strong human story values."<ref>{{cite news | author=[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]] | title = Jurassic Park | publisher = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = June 11, 1993 | url = http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/jurassic-park-1993 | accessdate = February 4, 2007}}</ref> Henry Sheehan argued, "The complaints over ''Jurassic Park'''s lack of story and character sound a little off the point," pointing out the story arc of Grant learning to protect Hammond's grandchildren despite his initial dislike of them.<ref name="lack of story?" /> ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine gave the film five stars, hailing it as "quite simply one of the greatest blockbusters of all time."<ref>{{cite web|url=|title=Review of Jurassic Park|author=Westbrook, Caroline |work=Empire|accessdate=2014-01-07}}</ref> ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'' rated the film a "Certified Fresh" of 93%, with an average score of 8.2 out of 10. The site's consensus states "''Jurassic Park'' is a spectacle of special effects and life-like animatronics, with some of Spielberg's best sequences of sustained awe and sheer terror since ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''."<ref>{{cite web | title = Jurassic Park | publisher = Rotten Tomatoes | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jurassic_park/ | accessdate = April 19, 2013}}</ref>

In the years following its release, ''Jurassic Park'' has frequently been cited by film critics and industry professionals as one of the greatest movies of the action and thriller genres.

The biggest impact ''Jurassic Park'' had on subsequent films regarded Industrial Light and Magic's computer-generated visual effects. Film historian [[Tom Shone]] commented on the film's innovation and influence, saying that "In its way, ''Jurassic Park'' heralded a revolution in movies as profound as the coming of sound in 1927."<ref>Shone, Tom.
