'''Dr Mark Freuder Knopfler''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born [[August 12]], [[1949]], [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]) is a [[Great Britain|British]] [[guitarist]], [[singer]], and [[songwriter]]. His vocal style is best described by the German phrase ''[[Sprechgesang]]'' <U+2014> not quite singing, not quite speaking. His use of guitar has been compared to adding another 'voice' to his songs.

He is best-known as the lead guitarist and vocalist for the band [[Dire Straits]], but has also made albums as a solo performer and played in other groups (such as The Notting Hillbillies). He has also performed on the work of other artists, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Steely Dan]] and the late [[Chet Atkins]]. He has produced albums for artists such as [[Tina Turner]], [[Randy Newman]], Bob Dylan and [[Emmylou Harris]]. In addition, he has scored the music to several films, including ''[[Local Hero]]'', ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'', ''[[Cal (film)|Cal]]'',  ''[[Last Exit to Brooklyn]]'' and ''[[Wag the Dog]]''. 

He is widely regarded as one of the best [[fingerstyle]] guitarists of the modern era. Knopfler was ranked #27 on ''[[Rolling Stone Magazine|Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".

==Biography==
===Early days===
Mark Knopfler is the son of a Jewish [[architect]] whose [[communist]] sympathies forced him to flee the [[fascist]] regime in his native [[Hungary]]. When Knopfler was about nine years old, the family moved to [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in the North-East of England. There, he and his younger brother [[David Knopfler|David]] (also a musician) attended [[Gosforth Grammar School]]. He was inspired by his uncle Kingsley's [[harmonica]] and [[boogie-woogie]] piano playing. Later, in his teens, he wished to buy the expensive flamingo-pink [[Fender Stratocaster]] just like [[Hank Marvin|Hank Marvin's]], but had to settle for a <U+00A3>50 twin [[Pickup (music)|pickup]] [[H<U+00F6>fner]] Super Solid. Like many other schoolboys of the 1960s, he served an early apprenticeship by forming and joining anonymous schoolboy bands and listening to guitarists such as [[Chet Atkins]], [[Scotty Moore]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Django Reinhardt]] and [[James Burton]]. At sixteen he made a local TV appearance as half of a harmony duo along with school-friend Sue Hercombe.

At school Knopfler had demonstrated a flair for English and in 1967 he studied [[journalism]] for a year at Harlow Technical College. At the end of the course he secured a job in [[Leeds]] as a junior reporter on the ''[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]''. After two years he decided to further his studies and commenced a degree in English at [[Leeds University]]. He also worked as a lecturer at [[Loughton College]] during this period. It was whilst Knopfler was living in Leeds that he met a local [[blues]] singer/guitarist by the name of Steve Phillips. 

He then moved (alone) to London and joined a band called [[Brewer's Droop]]. One night while spending some time with friends, the only guitar available was an old acoustic with a badly warped neck that had been strung with extra-light strings to make it playable. Even with that, he found it impossible to play unless he finger-picked it. He said in a later interview, "That was where I found my 'voice' on guitar." Soon after he made his first record in a [[London]] studio: an unreleased demo of an original song, "Summer's Coming My Way".

===Dire Straits===
{{main|Dire Straits}}
Dire Straits' first sessions were done with the name of Knopfler's earlier band called Cafe Racers, but after a short time, with a new drummer and bass player they changed their name to Dire Straits, due to their poor financial situation at the time. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Dire Straits recorded and released their [[Dire Straits (album)|first, self-titled album]] in [[1978]] to little fanfare but five months later a single release, "[[Sultans of Swing]]" became a chart hit and album sales took off. The second album, ''[[Communiqu<U+00E9> (album)|Communiqu<U+00E9>]]'', followed in [[1979]]. The band's third album, ''[[Making Movies]]'', was released in [[1980]] and marked a move towards more complex arrangements and production which would continue for the remainder of the group's career.  

In [[1982]] Dire Straits released their fourth album, ''[[Love Over Gold]]''.  Around this time Mark Knopfler was also concentrating on other things, writing the music score for the film ''[[Local Hero]]'', released in [[1983]].  This was followed by ''[[Cal (film)|Cal]]'' in [[1984]].
With the release of ''Love Over Gold'' there was a world tour called ''[[Alchemy: Dire Straits Live]]''. A double-LP of the 
recordings of two live shows in Hammersmith Odeon in London sold over 500,000 albums.
Dire Straits' biggest-selling album was their fifth, ''[[Brothers in Arms (Dire Straits album)|Brothers in Arms]]'', which became an international hit on its release in [[1985]], and spawned several chart singles including the number one hit "[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]", which was the first video ever to be played on [[MTV]] in Britain. The band's 1985<U+2013>86 world tour was immensely successful.

After the ''Brothers in Arms'' tour Dire Straits went on a lengthy hiatus, with Knopfler concentrating on solo work, film soundtracks and work with The Notting Hillbillies. Dire Straits regrouped in 1988 for the [[Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute]] concert at Wembley Stadium, in which they were the headline act and were accompanied by [[Eric Clapton]]. 1990 saw the recording of Dire Straits' final original studio album, ''[[On Every Street]]'', which was released in 1991.  The album met with a mixed critical reaction, regarded by some as an underwhelming follow up to ''Brothers in Arms''.

After ''On Every Street'', two live albums were released, the first of which, ''[[On the Night]]'' (1993), documented Dire Straits' final tour. This was followed two years later by ''[[Live at the BBC (Dire Straits album)|Live at the BBC]]''.  

Dire Straits' line-up changed over the band's career, but Knopfler was always the driving force behind the group.  After expressing a desire to give up touring on a large scale, Mark Knopfler launched his solo career and quietly disbanded Dire Straits in 1995. The band's keyboardist [[Guy Fletcher]] has been associated with almost every piece of Knopfler's solo material following Dire Straits' dissolution.
 
However, in 2002 Mark Knopfler did four charity concerts with the band members [[John Illsley]], [[Chris White]], Danny Cummings and Guy Fletcher playing some old Dire Straits songs. The session also included The Notting Hillbillies.

===After Dire Straits===
In [[1996]], the year after Dire Straits officially disbanded, Knopfler released his first solo album, ''[[Golden Heart]]''. Formed during the ''Golden Heart'' sessions, the main line-up of his solo band, also known as "The 96'ers", has lasted much longer than any Dire Straits line-up. In August the same year, ''Brothers in Arms'' was certified nine times [[platinum album|platinum]].

In [[1997]] ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine released a poll: "Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll", which included "Sultans of Swing", Dire Straits' first hit, which remained significant throughout their entire career as a band.

In 1997 Knopfler recorded the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Wag the Dog]]''. In October a hits collection of Dire Straits was released: ''[[Sultans of Swing: The Very Best of Dire Straits]]''.

Knopfler has also released four other solo albums since the parting of Dire Straits: ''Golden Heart'' (1996), ''[[Sailing to Philadelphia]]'' (2000), ''[[The Ragpicker's Dream]]'' (2002) and ''[[Shangri-La (Knopfler album)|Shangri-La]]'', which was recorded at the Shangri-La Studio in [[Malibu, California]] in 2004 (the same place where [[The Band]] made recordings for ''[[The Last Waltz]]''). In the promo for "Shangri-La" on his official website he said that his current line-up of Glenn Worf (bass), Guy Fletcher (keyboards), Chad Cromwell (drums), Richard Bennett (guitar) and Matt Rollings (piano) play Dire Straits songs better than Dire Straits did. The "Shangri-La" tour took Mark to countries like India and the UAE for the first time. In India, his concerts at Bombay and Bangalore were very well received, with over 20,000 fans gathering at each concert to listen to a legend who many thought would never visit their country.

In late 2005 a third compilation, ''[[The Best of Dire Straits & Mark Knopfler: Private Investigations]]'' was released, and consisted of material from most of Dire Straits' studio albums and Knopfler's solo and soundtrack material.
[[Image:MK-Ott-sm.jpg|left|thumb|230px|Mark Knopfler|Mark Knopfler in 2005]]
Knopfler recorded an album of duets with [[country music]] singer [[Emmylou Harris]], entitled ''[[All the Roadrunning]]'', which was released on April 24 2006. It reached #1 in Denmark and Switzerland, #2 in Norway and Sweden, #3 in Germany, Holland and Italy, #8 in Austria and UK, #9 in Spain, #17 in the United States (Billboard Top 200 Chart), #25 in Ireland and #41 in Australia.

Joined by Emmylou Harris, Knopfler supported ''[[All the Roadrunning]]'' with a successful world tour. Selections from the duo's June performance at the Gibson Ampitheatre were released as a CD/DVD package entitled ''[[Real Live Roadrunning]]'' on Nov. 14, 2006. In addition to several of the compositions that Harris and Knopfler recorded together in the studio, ''Real Live Roadrunning'' features solo hits from both members of the duo, as well as three tracks from Knopfler's days with Dire Straits.

''All The Roadrunning'' was nominated for "Best Folk Rock/Americana Album" at the [http://www.grammy.com 49th Grammy Awards (external site)] (Feb 11, 2007) but lost out to Bob Dylan's nomination for [[Modern Times (Bob Dylan album)|''Modern Times'']].

Mark has already begun work on his next solo album in London. Guy Fletcher maintains a studio diary on his web site. The link to his diary is on [http://www.mark-knopfler-news.co.uk. the official Mark Knopfler news site.]

==Music== 
Mark Knopfler is noted for being left-handed, but playing right-handed, and for [[fingerpicking]] (using a personal variant of the "claw-hammer") style instead of using a [[plectrum]] (i.e., "pick"); fingerpicking is usually associated with the [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]], but Knopfler usually (though not always) plays an [[electric guitar]]. 

Knopfler was the guitar hero of the 80's and played some of the decade's definitive riffs/solos. Mark's tone evolved from the simple and clean (or slightly overdriven) guitar sound of the Straits' first two albums to the "rocky" overdriven sounds on Brothers In Arms and on to the warm tube sounds on his solo albums.

He has around 70 guitars, including:

*[[Fender Stratocaster]]s including a 1954 (one of the first ever produced) which he has named "Jurassic Strat"
*[[Fender Telecaster]]s
*[[Gibson Les Paul]]s
*Custom [[Pensa]]s (http://www.pensaguitars.com)   (MK-1 MK-2 & MK-80)
*[[Schecter]]s
*National Style 0 [[Resonator guitar]], as used on "[[Romeo and Juliet (song)|Romeo and Juliet]]".
*A Gibson super 400 (used on "Your Latest Trick") which costs 20,000 pounds {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Personal life==
Knopfler used to live in the London district [[Notting Hill]]. During his time there, he formed a band named The Notting Hillbillies over a meal at a local [[wine bar]].

Knopfler has been married three times. His second marriage to Lourdes Salamone from 1983-1993 gave him twin sons, Benji and Joseph (born 1987); and his third marriage to actress [[Kitty Aldridge]] has given him daughters Isabella (born 1998) and Katya Ruby Rose (born 2003). The family currently lives in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], a neighbourhood of London, England.

Knopfler's guitar classic "Going Home" from the [[Local Hero (album)|soundtrack]] to ''[[Local Hero]]'' is used before kick-off at [[Newcastle United|Newcastle United's]] home matches at [[St James' Park]]. Knopfler makes a few appearances at St James' to watch his favourite side, and did a [[Charitable organization|charity]] [[gig]] at Shearer's Bar at St James' Park.

A keen motorcyclist, in March 2003 Knopfler was involved in a motorbike crash, suffering from a broken collarbone, broken shoulder blade and seven broken ribs. The accident was caused by a South American woman who was in England illegally and was subsequently deported. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} Knopfler recovered and was able to return to the stage in 2004.

Knopfler holds a degree in [[English studies|English]] from [[Leeds University]], as well as an honorary music degree given to him by [[Newcastle University]] in [[1993]]. In May [[2006]], Knopfler became a Doctor of Music (DMus) at Newcastle University.

* British author and humorist [[Douglas Adams]] about Knopfler: "Mark Knopfler has an extraordinary ability to make a Schecter Custom Stratocaster hoot and sing like angels on a Saturday night, exhausted from being good all week and needing a stiff beer." (see: ''[[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]]'', published London, 1984)

* The dinosaur species ''[[Masiakasaurus knopfleri]]'' was named after Knopfler. The paleontologists were listening to Dire Straits recordings when they discovered the species. [http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/template.cfm?name=knopfler]
