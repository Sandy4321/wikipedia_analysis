'''Utah State Route 158''' is a [[state highway]] in the U.S. state of [[Utah]]. Spnning {{convert|11.6|mi|km}}, it connects [[Powder Mountain Ski Resort]] and the towns of [[Liberty, Utah|Liberty]] and [[Eden, Utah|Eden]] with [[Utah State Route 39]] in [[Ogden Canyon]] in [[Weber County, Utah|Weber County]].

==Route description==
State Route 158 begins at [[Eden Junction, Utah|Eden Junction]], its intersection with SR-39 at the [[Pineview Dam]] which is at the top of Ogden Canyon. From this point, it travels north across the dam and follows the shore of [[Pineview Reservoir]] to the northeast, eventually turning to the north.<ref name=Google Maps">{{Google maps|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?q=utah+state+route+158&hl=en&sll=41.282838,-111.813869&sspn=0.091717,0.184364&vpsrc=0&hnear=Utah+158,+Eden,+Utah+84310&t=m&z=12|title=Utah State Route 158}}</ref> As it continues north past the end of the reservoir, it passes the town of Eden and former SR-162 which connects to Liberty. Continuing north, the route passes the Wolf Creek Golf Resort before entering the narrow, steep canyon on its climb to [[Powder Mountain]]. The road to Powder Mountain is one of the steepest state highways in Utah with an average [[grade (slope)|grade]] of approximately 14% over {{convert|5|mi|km}}.<ref name="Powder Mountain Motocross">{{cite web|title=Powder Mountain Motocross - Directions|url=http://powdermountainmotocross.com/directions.php|accessdate=20 August 2011|publisher=[[Powder Mountain]]}}</ref>

==History==
The road from Eden Junction ([[SR-39 (UT)|SR-39]] at Pineview Dam) north to Liberty was added to the state highway system in 1933 as a southern segment of [[Utah State Route 163 (1933)|State Route 163]],<ref name="163 resolution 1933">{{cite UTSR law|year=1933|chapter=30|quote=(163) From Hyrum southerly to Avon and from Eden Junction on route 39 northerly to Liberty.}}</ref> and was transferred to '''State Route 162''' in 1935.<ref name="162 resolution 1935">{{cite UTSR law|year=1935|quote=Route 162. From Eden Junction on route 39 northerly to Liberty.}}</ref><ref name="163 resolution 1935">{{cite UTSR law|year=1935|quote=Route 163. From Hyrum southerly to Avon.}}</ref> In 1955, SR-162 was extended north to the forest boundary, and truncated back to Liberty again in 1963.<ref name="162 resolutions">{{cite web|title=State Route 162 Resolutions|publisher=[[Utah Department of Transportation]]|url=http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/uconowner.gf?n=200609190934391|accessdate=16 August 2011|November 2008|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}</ref> In 1965, SR-162 was extended north from [[Liberty, Utah|Liberty]] to [[Avon, Utah|Avon]], ending at the southern terminus of SR-163.<ref name="162 resolutions"/> In order to maintain continuity in the state highway system, SR-162 absorbed SR-163 the following year, resulting in SR-162 stretching from Eden Junction through Liberty to Avon.<ref name="162 resolutions"/>

In 1969, SR-162's northern end was moved back south to Liberty. In the process, the road from Liberty to Paradise was removed from the state highway system, and the road from Paradise to Hyrum was re-designated as part of [[Utah State Route 165|State Route 165]]. As part of the same redesignation, the so-called "Eden Bypass", a short, {{convert|0.57|mi|km}} road providing a shorter connection between SR-162 and the town of [[Eden, Utah|Eden]] was added to SR-162 as a spur/leg.<ref name="162 resolutions"/> Also in 1969, '''State Route 166''' was added to the state highway system, designated as the road from SR-39 at [[Huntsville, Utah|Huntsville]] north and east around Pineview Reservoir to SR-162 in Eden (the northern end of SR-166 was the road bypassed by the south leg of SR-162).<ref name="166 resolutions">{{cite web|title=State Route 166 Resolutions|publisher=[[Utah Department of Transportation]]|url=http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/uconowner.gf?n=200609190938481|accessdate=20 October 2011|November 2008|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}</ref> In 1975, the "Eden Bypass" section of SR-162 was split off and redesignated as '''State Route 89'''<ref name="89 resolutions">{{cite web|title=State Route 89 Resolutions|publisher=[[Utah Department of Transportation]]|url=http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/uconowner.gf?n=200609181114081|accessdate=20 October 2011|November 2008|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}</ref> and renumbered as '''State Route 169''' two years later in the [[1977 Utah state route renumbering]], essentially swapping route numbers with former [[Utah State Route 169 (1962-1977)|Utah State Route 169]] which followed the alignment of [[US-89 (UT)|US-89]] between [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]] and the north end of [[Bountiful, Utah|Bountiful]].<ref name="169 resolutions">{{cite web|title=State Route 169 Resolutions|publisher=[[Utah Department of Transportation]]|url=http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/uconowner.gf?n=200609190942341|accessdate=20 October 2011|November 2008|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}</ref>

These highways remained unchanged until 1990, when UDOT recommended the road from the intersection of SR-162 and SR-166 to the parking lot at [[Powder Mountain]] be added to the state highway system in exchange for deleting SR-166, SR-169, and part of SR-162.<ref name="resolutions"/> As a result, the portion of SR-162 north of the SR-162/SR-166 intersection was removed from the state highway system, along with all of SR-166 and SR-169, while the remainder of SR-162 was redesignated as State Route 158 along with the aforementioned road to Powder Mountain. The route has remained unchanged since.
