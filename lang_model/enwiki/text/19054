'''Huckleberry "Huck" Hound''' is a fictional cartoon character created by [[Hanna-Barbera]], and the star of the 1958 animated series ''The Huckleberry Hound Show'', Hanna-Barbera's second series made for television after ''[[The Ruff & Reddy Show]]''. 

''The Huckleberry Hound Show'' was probably the series that truly made Hanna-Barbera a household name, thanks to Huckleberry (or "Huck" as he was sometimes nicknamed, referencing the novel ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'') and the two supporting segments of the show: [[Yogi Bear]] and his sidekick [[Boo Boo (Yogi Bear)|Boo Boo]], and [[Pixie and Dixie]], two mice who in each short found a new way to outwit the cat [[Mr. Jinks]]. After Yogi Bear was given his own show in [[1961]], his segment was replaced with one featuring [[Hokey Wolf]] and his sidekick Ding-a-Ling.

==Huckleberry Hound, the character==
Voiced by [[Daws Butler]], Huckleberry was a blue [[dog]] that spoke with a [[American English#Regional differences|Southern drawl]], with a relaxed, sweet, and well-intentioned personality. The term "Huckleberry" can be a slang synonym for a rube or an amateur, and that seems to fit Huck's personality. Most of his shorts consisted of Huck trying to find employment in different fields, ranging from policeman to (ironically enough) dogcatcher, with backfiring results, yet usually coming out on top, either through slow persistence or sheer luck. One regular villain in the series was "Powerful Pierre", a tall and muscular unshaven character with a French accent. Another trademark of Huck was his [[tone deaf]] (as well as inaccurate) rendition of "[[Oh My Darling, Clementine]]," often used as a [[running gag]]. He also commonly used the phrase "and stuff like that there" in place of "etc.". This phrase showed up quite often in many Hanna-Barbera productions of this time for some reason, but Huckleberry said it more often than anyone else. One of his careers once had his name and job position on the door. It listed a few of his responsibilities followed by "and SLTT". When the narrator asked him what that meant, Huck replied "stuff like that there".

Various Hanna-Barbera characters were known for frequently turning to the viewing audience to make little comments and asides (following the tradition of the [[Warner Bros.]] cartoon characters of the [[1940s]], and earlier by [[Groucho Marx]]). Huck took this to somewhat of an extreme, as a significant part of a typical cartoon was his running narrative to the audience about whatever he was trying to accomplish.

==The inspiration for Huck's voice==
Although the voice Butler gave to Huckleberry Hound resembles that of [[Andy Griffith]] (who had recently become famous in movies, though not yet on TV), Butler had already developed and used the voice in earlier work (such as the dog character in ''The Ruff & Reddy Show'', and earlier characters in the [[MGM]] cartoon library). It was said to be based on the neighbor of his wife, Myrtis; Butler would speak with said neighbor when visiting North Carolina. Because some of Hanna-Barbera's early shows (''[[The Flintstones]], [[Top Cat]]'') are acknowledged to be take-offs on celebrities and shows of the day, it is possible that the studio was partly capitalizing on Griffith's popularity in ''making use'' of the voice, but this was not its ''origin''.

==Following the original series==
After his original series ran its course, Huck continued to make appearances in other Hanna-Barbera series, mainly as a supporting character for his former costar, Yogi. Huck appeared in such series as ''[[Yogi's Gang]]'', ''[[Yogi's Space Race]]'', ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]]'' and even as a [[teenager]] in the series ''[[Yo, Yogi!]]'' Huck was also the star of the [[1980s]] [[television movie|made-for-television movie]], ''[[The Good, the Bad, and Huckleberry Hound]]''.

Today, Huck's television appearances, like those of the rest of the early Hanna-Barbera characters, are rare, though his shorts can often be found on [[Cartoon Network]]'s sister cable TV channel [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]], which are broadcast around the world. In addition, some of Huck's cartoons are also featured on various [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment|MCA Universal]] home video releases.

==DVD release==
On [[November 15]], [[2005]], [[Warner Home Video]] released '''The Huckleberry Hound Show - Vol. 1''', featuring the complete first series of 26 episodes from the series on DVD. The other remaining 31 episodes are yet to be released.

==Huckleberry Hound in popular culture==
{{Trivia|date=January 2008}}
* An episode of the prime-time animated TV show ''[[The Simpsons]]'' ("[[Behind the Laughter]]") parodies Huckleberry Hound, having him state, "I was so gay ... but I couldn't tell anyone."

* Huckleberry Hound appeared in the ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'' episode "Back on Shaq". He was the good-luck character for [[Seth Green]] who was facing off against [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and his good-luck person Johnny Bravo.

* Huckleberry Hound was key to [[Joel Barish]]'s character in the movie ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]''. Having the memory of his girlfriend "Clementine" erased caused connected memories to be lost. Do to Huck's constant singing of "Oh my darlin', Clementine" caused him to forget who Huckleberry Hound was as well.

* Huckleberry Hound made two [[cameo appearance]]s on ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]''.

* Huckleberry Hound made a cameo appearance on [[Adult Swim]]'s "[[The Brak Show]]"

* Huckleberry Hound appeared in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode "Ban on the Fun." In a segment that parodies the Laff-A-Lympics in the style of the Munich massacre, Huckleberry Hound was killed alongside his teammates.

* [[Cartoon Network]]'s Boomerang channel plays a more recent Huckleberry Hound animated short that strays greatly from the animation and story style of the original. Using cutout style animation, Huck simply makes everyone in a town be quiet so he can sing "Oh my Darlin'" in peace. It didn't follow the formula of the show which always gave him a career, and it made his singing seem more important to him than it ever did on the series where it seemed to simply be a tune he sang to himself during idle time.
