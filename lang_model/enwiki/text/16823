''' White''' is a [[color]], the [[Color vision#Physiology of color perception|perception]] which is evoked by [[light]] that stimulates all three types of color sensitive [[cone cells]] in the [[human eye]] in nearly equal amounts and with high [[brightness]] compared to the surroundings. A white visual stimulation will be void of [[hue]] and [[grayness]].<ref>{{cite book

White light can be generated in many ways. The [[Sun]] is such a source, electric [[incandescence]] is another. Modern light sources are [[fluorescent lamps]] and [[light-emitting diodes]]. An object that does not alter the color of light reflected from its surface will appear white, compared to the surroundings, unless it has very high [[specular reflection]].

Since white objects such as clouds, snow and flowers appear often in nature, human culture has many references to white, often related to purity and cleanness. The high [[contrast]] between white and [[black]] is often used to represent opposites. In some cultures, like Chinese, white is considered to be a color that represents death.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} On the other hand in many cultures white represents purity, freedom, and hygenic purity.

== Etymology ==
The word ''[[:wikt:white|white]]'' continues [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|hw<U+012B>t}}'', ultimately from a [[Common Germanic]] ''{{lang|gem|*x<sup>w</sup><U+012B>taz}}'' also reflected in [[Old High German|OHG]] ''{{lang|goh|(h)w<U+00EE>z}}'', [[Old Norse|ON]] ''{{lang|non|hv<U+00ED>tr}}'', [[Gothic language|Goth.]] ''{{lang|got|<U+0195>eits}}''. The root is ultimately from a [[PIE]] ''{{PIE|*k<sup>w</sup>id-}}'', surviving also in [[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|cvid}}'' "to be white or bright" and perhaps Slavic ''{{lang|sla-Latn|svet'}}'' "light".<ref>[[OED]]; {{cite web

== Light ==
[[File:Dispersion prism.jpg|right|200px|thumb|White light [[refract]]ed in a [[prism (optics)|prism]] revealing the color components.]]

Until [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s work became accepted, most [[science|scientists]] believed that white was the fundamental color of light; and that other colors were formed only by adding something to light. Newton demonstrated this was not true by passing white light through a [[prism (optics)|prism]], then through another prism. If the colors were added by the prism, the second prism should have added further colors to the single-colored beam. Since the single-colored beam remained a single color, Newton concluded that the prism merely [[dispersion (optics)|separated the colors]] already present in the light. White light is the effect of combining the visible colors of light in equal proportions. 

Since the impression of white is obtained by three [[summation]]s of light intensity across the [[visible spectrum]], the number of combinations of light wavelengths that produce the sensation of white is practically infinite. There are a number of different white light sources such as the midday [[Sun]], [[incandescent]] lamps, [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent]] lamps and [[Led#White light|white LEDs]]; due to the phenomenon of [[metamerism (color)|metamerism]], such sources can appear similar whilst having quite different spectra. The impression of white light can also be created by mixing appropriate intensities of the [[primary color]]s of light, [[red]], [[green]] and [[blue]] ([[RGB]]),  a process called [[additive mixing]], as seen in many [[display technology|display technologies]].
===Color temperature===
The best known way to generate white light is by the process called ''[[incandescence]]'', or [[black body radiation]] where bodies of atoms with a certain temperature emit a certain type of radiation. For example, the color of a black body at a temperature of 2,848 [[kelvin]]. This is closely matched by incandescent [[light bulb]]s. The [[correlated color temperature]] of such a light bulb is 2,848&nbsp;K. Daylight can vary from a cool red up to a bluish 5,600&nbsp;K. Not all black body radiation can be considered white light: the [[background radiation]] of the [[universe]], to name an extreme example, is only a few kelvin and is quite [[visible spectrum|invisible]].

In astronomy the [[stellar class]] of stars are determined by the color temperature. For instance are [[white dwarfs]] small dense stars thought to be the final [[stellar evolution|evolutionary state]].

[[Computer display]]s often have a [[color temperature]] control, allowing the user to select the color temperature (usually from a small set of fixed values) of the light emitted when the computer produces the electrical signal corresponding to ''white''. The [[RGB]] coordinates of white are (255, 255, 255).

== Objects ==
[[File:Plankton creates sea foam1 .jpg|thumb|right|[[Foam]] of a transparent and reflecting liquid ([[plankton]]), turning white when the size of the bubbles decreases.]]

White light [[reflected]] off objects can be seen when no part of the light spectrum is reflected significantly more than any other and the reflecting material has a degree of [[Diffuse reflection|diffusion]]. People see this when [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] [[fiber]]s, [[wiktionary:Particle|particle]]s, or [[droplet]]s are in a transparent matrix of a substantially different [[List of indices of refraction|refractive index]]. Examples include classic "white" substances such as [[sugar]], [[foam]], pure [[sand]] or [[snow]], [[cotton]], [[clouds]], and [[milk]]. [[Crystal]] boundaries and imperfections can also make otherwise transparent materials white, as in the milky [[quartz]] or the microcrystalline structure of a [[seashell]]. This is also true for artificial [[paints]] and [[pigments]], where white results when finely divided transparent material of a high refractive index is suspended in a contrasting binder. Typically paints contain [[calcium carbonate]] and/or synthetic [[rutile]] with no other pigments if a white color is desired.

While the color of a light source can be reasonably measured by its [[correlated color temperature]], a different approach is required for objects since different samples may appear white without a reference. Thus, assessment of [[whiteness]] requires a comparison. The [[International Commission on Illumination]] (CIE) prescribes one such method.

In [[painting]], white can be crafted by [[Reflection (physics)|reflecting]] ambient light from a white [[pigment]], although the ambient light must be white light, or else the white pigment will appear the color of the light. White when mixed with black produces [[gray (color)|gray]]. In [[watercolor painting]], white areas mark the absence of paint on the paper.

=== In nature ===
[[File:MontBlanc2c.jpg|thumb|[[Mont Blanc]] in the [[Alps]]]]

[[Snow]] and [[ice]] are normally white due to the [[diffusing]] structure of transparent [[ice|water ice crystals]]. The same is true for many types of [[clouds]] where droplets of water diffuse the white light from the Sun. 
Many mountains with winter or year-round snow cover are named accordingly: [[Mauna Kea]] means ''white mountain'' in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Mont Blanc]] means ''white mountain'' in French. [[Changbai Mountains]] literally meaning 'Perpetually White' Mountains, marks the border between China and Korea and [[Mount Kilimanjaro]]'s name could originate from [[Swahili]] meaning little white hill. The [[White Sea]], an [[inlet]] of the [[Barents Sea]] on the northwest coast of Russia is undoubtedly named so due to the icy environment.

Beaches with [[sand]] containing high amounts of quartz also appear white,  which may explain the number of islands called [[White Island]] around the world.

==Cultural meaning==
{{Refimprovesect|date=January 2008}}
White materials show colored stains and dirt very clearly, due to the high [[contrast]]. This is the likely reason it is associated with purity and cleanness, and very often within a religious context. In Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Indian and Japanese tradition, white is the color of [[mourning]] and [[death]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

=== Symbolic dualism with black ===
{{See|black and white dualism}}
White and black has the biggest visual [[Contrast_(vision)|contrast]], this can easily be associated to other opposite concepts such as day and night good and evil.
White often represents purity or innocence in [[Western culture|Western Civilization]],<ref>{{cite book|title=The [[Encyclopedia Americana]]: A Library of Universal Knowledge|publisher=Encyclopedia Americana Corp|year=1918|pages=329}}</ref> particularly as white clothing or objects are easy to stain. In most Western countries white is the color worn by brides at weddings. [[Angels]] are typically depicted as clothed in white robes. Healing or "good" magic is called [[magic (paranormal)|White magic]].<ref> Bailey, Alice A. ''A Treatise on White Magic'' New York:1934 Lucis Publishing Co.</ref> In early film Westerns the stereotypically "good guy" wore a white hat (earning them the name "White Hats") while the "bad guy" wore black (earning them the name "Black Hats"). This has given rise to the use of the names [[black hat]] and [[white hat]] for people who abuse and counter abuse of [[computer systems]] respectively. In popular culture this idea is sometimes reversed to play on reversal of stereotypes. 

In [[taoism]] which has great influence in Eastern culture [[Yin and yang]] is usually depicted in black and white, depicting the two colors as opposites. The two opponents in board games of [[abstract strategy]] often has one as white, such as [[Go (board game)|go]], [[chess]], and [[checkers]].

=== Government and politics ===
[[File:White ribbon.svg|right|thumb|100px|[[White Ribbon]]]]

White is often associated with [[Monarchism]] as opposed to other forms of government. This originated from Royalist rebellions against the [[French Revolution]] (see [[Revolt in the Vend<U+00E9>e]]), known as the [[White terror]]. It re-emerged in the years following [[World War I]], with [[civil war]]s fought between ''Reds'' and ''Whites'', for instance the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War in Russia]] and the [[Civil War in Finland]]. A similar use is seen in the naming of the [[White Revolution]] ({{lang-fa|Enghelab-e-Sephid}}),a far-reaching series of reforms launched in 1963 by the last [[Pahlavi dynasty|Shah]] of [[Iran]]. If a strong leader emerges during a time of crisis, he is often referred to as a ''man on a white horse'', this term is often associated with [[dictatorship]]s.

White is also associated with peace. The [[white ribbon]] is worn by movements denouncing [[violence against women]] and the [[White Rose]] was a non-violent [[Widerstand|resistance]] group in [[Nazi Germany]]. This symbolism has long roots as seen by the [[Peace sign#Dove and olive branch|white dove]] originating from the story of [[Noah]].
A [[white flag]] is an international sign of either [[surrender (military)|surrender]], or [[truce]], that is, it is a sign of [[peace]]ful intent, typically at time of [[war]]. To ''show the [[white feather]]'' is to display cowardice. In [[Victorian era|Victorian Britain]], a purported coward would be presented with a white feather.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

White as symbol of purity is seen in the expression [[Whitewash]], which figuratively, means an attempt to obscure unpleasant facts by issuing a blanket of lies or misrepresentations. See [[propaganda]]. A [[white paper]] on the other hand will often be a authoritative report on a major issue, as by a team of experts; a government report outlining policy; or a short treatise whose purpose is to educate industry customers. Associating a paper with white may signify clean facts and unbiased information.

=== Religion ===
The association of white with purity and peace is used by many religions, where [[liturgy|liturgical]] robes of [[priest]]s are often white, for instance the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Pope]]'s [[cassock]] is white and white robes are worn inside [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|Mormon Temples]].<ref> Whalen, William J. ''The Latter Day Saints in the Modern Day World'' 1962</ref> This phenomenon is not limited to western culture, in [[Yoruba religion]] The orisha [[Obatala]] in the [[If<U+00E1>]] tradition is represented by white. Obatala is associated with calmness, morality, old age, and purity. Also more recently founded religions incorporate symbolism surrounding white.  In [[Theosophy]], and similar religions the [[deity|deities]] called the [[Great White Brotherhood]], are said to have white [[aura (paranormal)|auras]].<ref>Prophet, Elizabeth Clare ''The Great White Brotherhood in the Culture, History and Religion of America'' Summit University Press, 1975</ref>

White is the traditional color of [[bride|bridal]] dress in both western (European) and [[Wedding#Japanese wedding customs|Japanese weddings]]. In Western weddings, a white dress is thought to be symbolic of purity (the bride has not engaged in pre-marital sex). This is also said to be the symbolism of the veil. In [[Tsunokakushi|Japanese weddings]], white is to symbolize the "death" of their former family and their introduction into their new family.

=== Clothing ===

White clothing can be practically used as [[camouflage]] in snowy environments, or for reflecting harsh sunlight. However, most uniforms with white elements are used as a sign of authority - dissociating the wearer from manual labour or a dirty environment. In a highly-formal social function, the traditional dress for men attending is [[white tie]], or ''white tie and tails'', a white [[bow tie]] and a [[tailcoat|swallowtail]] coat. [[Physicians]] and [[scientists]] are known for wearing [[white coats]] both as a practical measure as protecting from and showing spills and stains, and as a sort of [[uniform]] showing authority.

Many traditional sports use white uniforms for players, such as [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] tennis, [[cricket]], and [[baseball]] and [[basketball]], where white is the color typically used for uniforms worn by the home team. This may be a result of the sports being played  outside exposing players to direct sunlight for prolonged periods of time.

=== Ethnography ===
{{Main|color metaphor for race}}

The term ''white'' is often used in the [[Western World|West]] to denote the race of pale-skinned [[Caucasian race|Caucasoids]] people of European descent with pale to white [[skin color]], whose skin color actually varies widely from pale [[pink]] to [[Brown#Pale brown|pale brown]]. It has been suggested that the colors [[beige]] or [[peach (color)|peach]] are a more accurate representation of the color of most Caucasians. For more details, see [[White people]].

=== Vexillology and heraldry ===
[[Vatican City]] has a [[Flag of the Vatican City|flag]] of [[yellow]] and white (although in normal European heraldry one is not supposed to use these two colors together because both represent ''metals''--yellow represents [[Gold (color)|gold]] and white represents [[Silver (color)|silver]]), to show that the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] is not bound by [[Secularism|secular]] rules.<ref> ''Flags'' Compton<U+2019>s Encyclopedia 1958 edition</ref> In English [[heraldry]], white or [[silver (color)|silver]] signified brightness, purity, virtue, and innocence.<ref>The American Girls Handy Book, pg. 369</ref>
