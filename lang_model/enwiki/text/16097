On 31 August 1997, '''[[Diana, Princess of Wales]]''', died as a result of injuries sustained in a car collision in the [[Pont de l'Alma]] road tunnel in Paris, France. Her companion, [[Dodi Fayed]], and the driver of the [[Mercedes-Benz W140]], [[Henri Paul]], were pronounced dead at the scene of the accident. Fayed's [[bodyguard]], [[Trevor Rees-Jones (bodyguard)|Trevor Rees-Jones]], was the only survivor. Although at first the media pinned the blame on the [[paparazzi]], the crash was ultimately found to be caused by the reckless actions of the chauffeur, who was the head of security at the [[Ritz-Carlton|Ritz]] and had earlier goaded the paparazzi waiting outside the hotel.<ref name="days-shook">{{cite episode|title=The Coronation of Elizabeth II/The Death of Diana|series=Days That Shook the World|serieslink=Days that Shook the World|credits=Director: David Bartlett, Executive Producer: David Upshal|network=[[BBC]]}}</ref> An 18-month French judicial investigation concluded in 1999 that the crash was caused by Henri Paul, who lost control of the car at high speed while under the [[drunkenness|influence]] of alcohol, which may have been made worse by the simultaneous presence of an [[anti-depressant]] and traces of a tranqulizing [[anti-psychotic]] in his body.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|title=Diana crash caused by chauffeur, says report |coauthor=Julian Nundy, David Graves|work=The Daily Telegraph| location=London |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1999/09/04/ndi04.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021113190313/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1999/09/04/ndi04.html|archivedate=13 November 2002}}</ref><ref name="paul-autopsy">{{cite web|url=http://www.public-interest.co.uk/diana/dianasynop.htm|first=Dr. Alan D.|last=Barbour|title=Synopsis of Autopsy Findings|accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref>

An inquest headed by [[Scott Baker (judge)|LJ Scott Baker]] into the deaths of Diana and Dodi began at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]], London, on 2 October 2007 and was a continuation of the original inquest that began in 2004.<ref name="inquests">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottbaker-inquests.gov.uk/faq/index.htm |title=Inquests into the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales and Mr Dodi Al Fayed: FAQs |accessdate=4 June 2010 |year=2008 |work=Coroner's Inquests into the Deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales and Mr Dodi Al Fayed |publisher=Judicial Communications Office}}</ref> On 7 April 2008, the jury released an official statement that Diana and Dodi were unlawfully killed by the [[Gross negligence|grossly negligent]] driving of chauffeur Henri Paul and the paparazzi.<ref name=verdict>{{cite web| url=http://www.scottbaker-inquests.gov.uk/hearing_transcripts/verdict.htm |title=Hearing transcripts: 7&nbsp;April 2008 <U+2013> Verdict of the jury|publisher=Judicial Communications Office|accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref> Though the official verdict implicated the pursuing vehicles, the jury also named the intoxication of the driver and the victims' decisions to not wear seat-belts as contributing factors to their deaths.

==Circumstances==
On 30 August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales, arrived in Paris, France, with [[Dodi Fayed]], the son of [[Mohamed al-Fayed]]. They had stopped there en route to London, having spent the preceding nine days together on board Mohamed al-Fayed<U+2019>s yacht, the ''Jonikal'', on the [[French Riviera|French]] and [[Italian Riviera]]. They had intended to stay overnight. Mohamed al-Fayed was and is the owner of the [[H<U+00F4>tel Ritz Paris]]. He also owned an apartment in Rue Ars<U+00E8>ne Houssaye, a short distance from the hotel and located just off the [[Champs-<U+00C9>lys<U+00E9>es|Avenue des Champs Elys<U+00E9>es]].

[[Henri Paul]], the Acting Head of Security at the [[Ritz Hotel]], had been instructed to drive the hired black 1994 [[Mercedes-Benz W140|Mercedes-Benz S280]] through Paris in order to elude the [[paparazzi]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6217366.stm|title=Timeline: How Diana died|date=14 December 2006|work=[[The Conspiracy Files]]|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=13 October 2008}}</ref> A [[decoy]] vehicle left the Ritz first, attracting a throng of photographers. Diana and Fayed would then depart from the hotel's rear entrance.

At around 12:20&nbsp;am on 31 August 1997, Diana and Fayed left the Ritz to return to the apartment in rue Ars<U+00E8>ne Houssaye. They were the rear passengers in a black Mercedes-Benz S280, registration number "688 LTV 75",<!--by Operation Paget Report, but French Diana crash inquiry report: "police and rescue services discovered a black Mercedes vehicle, type S280, registration number 680 LTV75." Registration number 680 or 688 in French report ??--> driven by Paul. [[Trevor Rees-Jones (bodyguard)|Trevor Rees-Jones]], a member of the Fayed family's personal protection team, was in the front passenger seat.

They left from the rear of the hotel, the Rue Cambon exit. After crossing the [[Place de la Concorde]] they drove along Cours la Reine and Cours Albert 1er (the embankment road running parallel to the [[River Seine]]) into the Place de l<U+2019>Alma underpass. At around 12:23&nbsp;am at the entrance to the tunnel, their driver lost control; the car swerved to the left of the two-lane carriageway before colliding head-on with the 13th pillar supporting the roof at an estimated speed of {{convert|105|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref>[[#pagetreport|John Stevens, Baron Stevens of Kirkwhelpington]] p. 41.</ref> It then spun and hit the stone wall of the tunnel backwards, finally coming to a stop. The impact of the crash caused substantial damage, particularly to the front half of the vehicle. There was (and still is) no [[guard rail]] between the pillars to prevent this. The Place de l'Alma underpass is the only one on that embankment road that has roof-supporting pillars.

As the victims lay in the wrecked car, the photographers continued to take pictures. Critically injured, Diana was reported to repeatedly murmur "oh my God," and, after the photographers were pushed away by emergency teams, "leave me alone".<ref>{{cite news | title = Special Report: Princess Diana, 1961<U+2013>1997|url=http://www.time.com/time/daily/special/diana/timeline/augsept97/10.html |work=Time  | accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref>

Dodi Fayed had been sitting in the left rear passenger seat and appeared to be dead. Nevertheless, fire officers were still trying to resuscitate him when he was pronounced dead by a doctor at 1:32&nbsp;am; Henri Paul was declared dead on removal from the wreckage. Both were taken directly to the [[Institut M<U+00E9>dico-L<U+00E9>gal]] (IML), the Paris [[mortuary]], not to a hospital. [[Autopsy]] examination concluded that Paul and Fayed had both suffered a rupture in the isthmus of the [[aorta]] and a fractured spine, with, in the case of Paul, a medullar section in the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] region and in the case of Fayed a medullar section in the [[cervical vertebrae|cervical]] region.

Still conscious, Rees-Jones had suffered multiple serious facial injuries. The two forward passengers' [[airbag]]s had functioned normally. None of the car's occupants were wearing [[seat belt]]s.

Diana, who had been sitting in the rear right passenger seat, was still conscious. It was first reported that she was crouched on the floor of the vehicle with her back to the road. It was also reported that a photographer who saw Diana described her as bleeding from the nose and ears with her head rested on the back of the front passenger's seat; he tried to remove her from the car but her feet were stuck. Then he told her that help was on the way and to stay awake; there was no answer from Diana, just blinking.

In June 2007 the [[Channel 4]] documentary ''Diana: The Witnesses in the Tunnel'' claimed that the first person to touch Diana was Dr. Maillez,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/D/diana/ |title=channel4.com |publisher=channel4.com |date= |accessdate=30 April 2011}}</ref> who chanced upon the scene. He reported that Diana had no visible injuries but was in [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] and he supplied her with oxygen.

The first police patrol officers arrived at the scene at 12.30. Shortly afterwards, the seven paparazzi on the scene were arrested. Diana was removed from the car at 1:00&nbsp;am She then went into cardiac arrest. Following external [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]], Diana<U+2019>s heart started beating again. She was moved to the SAMU ambulance at 1:18&nbsp;am The ambulance departed the crash scene at 1:41&nbsp;am and arrived at the [[Piti<U+00E9>-Salp<U+00EA>tri<U+00E8>re Hospital]] at 2:06&nbsp;am<ref>[[#pagetreport|John Stevens, Baron Stevens of Kirkwhelpington]] pp. 525<U+2013>527.</ref> Despite attempts to save her, her internal injuries were too extensive: her heart had been displaced from the left to the right side of the chest, which tore the [[pulmonary vein]] and the [[pericardium]]. Despite lengthy [[resuscitation]] attempts, including internal cardiac massage, she died at 4&nbsp;am<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emergency.com/dianaded.htm |title=Series of Real-Time Reports involving the tragic death of Diana, Princess of Wales |publisher=Emergency.com |year=1997 |accessdate=13 October 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080507233601/http://www.emergency.com/dianaded.htm|archivedate=7 May 2008}}</ref>  At 5:30, her death was announced at a press conference held by a hospital doctor; [[Jean-Pierre Chev<U+00E8>nement]], France's Interior Minister; and [[Michael Jay, Baron Jay of Ewelme|Sir Michael Jay]], Britain's ambassador to France.

Many have speculated that if Diana had worn a seat belt, her injuries would have been less severe.<ref>{{cite news

Later that morning, Chev<U+00E8>nement, together with French Prime Minister [[Lionel Jospin]], [[Bernadette Chirac]] (the wife of the French President, [[Jacques Chirac]]), and [[Bernard Kouchner]] (French Health Minister), visited the hospital room where Diana's body lay and paid their last respects. After their visits, the [[Anglican]] [[Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe|Archdeacon of France]], Father [[Martin Draper]], said commendatory prayers from the [[Book of Common Prayer]].

At around 2:00&nbsp;pm, Diana's former husband, [[Prince Charles]], and two older sisters, [[Lady Sarah McCorquodale]] and [[Lady Jane Fellowes]], arrived in Paris; they left with her body 90 minutes later.

==Subsequent events==
Initial media reports stated Diana's car had collided with the pillar at {{convert|190|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, and that the speedometer's needle had jammed at that position. It was later announced the car's actual speed on collision was about 95<U+2013>110&nbsp;km/h (60<U+2013>70&nbsp;mph), and that the speedometer was [[electronic instrument cluster|digital]]; this conflicts with the list of available equipment and features of the Mercedes-Benz W140 S-Class, which used a computer-controlled [[analogue electronics|analogue]] speedometer, with no digital readout for speed. At any rate, the car was certainly travelling much faster than the legal [[speed limit]] of {{convert|50|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, and faster than was prudent for the Alma underpass. In 1999, a French investigation concluded the Mercedes had come into contact with another vehicle (a white [[Fiat Uno]]) in the tunnel. The driver of that vehicle has never come forward, and the vehicle itself has not officially been identified.

An eighteen-month French judicial investigation concluded in 1999 that the car crash that killed Diana was caused by Paul, who lost control of the car at high speed while [[Drunkenness|intoxicated]].<ref name="http1999">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1999/09/04/ndi04.html |title=Diana crash caused by chauffeur, says report |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= |accessdate=13 October 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080522130924/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1999/09/04/ndi04.html |archivedate = 22 May 2008}}</ref>

In October 2003, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' published a letter from Diana in which, ten months before her death, she wrote about a possible plot to kill her by tampering with the brakes of her car. <U+201C>This particular phase in my life is the most dangerous.<U+201D> She said <U+201C>my husband<ref>[http://www.conspiracyplanet.com/channel.cfm?ChannelID=41 Conspiracy Planet <U+2013> Princess Diana: Murder-Coverup <U+2013> Princess Diana Letter: 'Charles plans to kill me'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> is planning <U+2018>an accident<U+2019> in my car, brake failure and serious head injury in order to make the path clear for Charles to marry<U+201D>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedossier.ukonline.co.uk/Web%20Pages/MIRROR_Diana%20Letter%20Sensation%20'They%20Will%20Try%20To%20Kill%20Me'.html|title=Diana letter sensation: "They will try to kill me"|author=Jane Kerr|date=20 October 2003|publisher=mirror.co.uk}}</ref>

On 6 January 2004, six years after her death, an [[inquest]] into the deaths of Diana and Dodi Fayed opened in London held by [[Michael Burgess]], the coroner of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]]'s household. The coroner asked the then Metropolitan Police Commissioner, [[John Stevens, Baron Stevens of Kirkwhelpington|Sir John Stevens]], to make inquiries, in response to speculation (''see [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales#Conspiracy theories|below]]'') that the deaths were not an accident. The Metropolitan Police investigation reported their findings in [[Operation Paget]] in December 2006.

Later in 2004, US TV network [[CBS]] showed pictures of the crash scene showing an intact rear side and an intact centre section of the Mercedes, including one of an unbloodied Diana with no outward injuries, crouched on the rear floor of the vehicle with her back to the right passenger seat<U+2014>the right rear car door is completely opened. The release of these pictures caused uproar in the UK, where it was widely felt that the privacy of Diana was being infringed, and spurred another lawsuit by Mohammed al-Fayed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coverups.com/diana/photos-2.htm |title=see also photo no. 5 |publisher=Coverups.com |date= |accessdate=30 April 2011}}</ref>

In January 2006, Lord Stevens explained in an interview on [[GMTV]] that the case is substantially more complex than once thought. The ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]'' wrote on 29 January 2006 that agents of the British secret service were cross-examined, because they were in Paris at the time of the accident. It was suggested in many journals that these agents might have exchanged the blood test of the driver with another blood sample (although no evidence for this has ever been forthcoming).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2014816,00.html|work=The Sunday Times <U+2013> Britain|date=29 January 2006|title=Doubts cast over blood samples in Diana inquiry | location=London | first=David | last=Leppard | accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref><!--Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung|date=30 January 2006|title=Auftrieb f<U+00FC>r Spekulationen (in: Aus Aller Welt)}} {{de icon}}</ref> --><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theroyalist.net/content/view/372/2/|publisher=The Royalist|date=30 January 2006|title=The Diana Investigation: What Lord Stevens Really Said}}</ref>

On 13 July 2006, the Italian magazine ''Chi'' published a photograph showing Diana in her "last moments" despite an unofficial blackout on such photographs being published. The photograph was taken shortly after the crash, and shows the Princess slumped in the back seat while a paramedic attempts to fit an oxygen mask over her face. This photograph was also published in other Italian and Spanish magazines and newspapers.

The editor of ''Chi'' defended his decision by saying he published the photographs taken from the French investigation dossier for the "simple reason that they haven't been seen before" and that he felt the images do not disrespect the memory of the former Princess.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5181226.stm|title=BBC | date=14 July 2006 | accessdate=2 January 2010 |publisher=BBC News }}</ref>

==Funeral==
{{Main|Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales}}
[[File:Flowers for Princess Diana's Funeral.jpg|thumb|right|Flowers left outside [[Kensington Palace]]]]
Diana's death was met with extraordinary public expressions of grief, and her public funeral at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 6 September drew an estimated 3&nbsp;million<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.londonnet.co.uk/ln/talk/news/diheadlines_previous1.html |title=Diana, Princess of Wales: The story so far |publisher=LondonNet}}</ref> mourners and onlookers in London, as well as worldwide television coverage, which overshadowed the news of the death the previous day of [[Mother Teresa]].

Members of the public were invited to sign a book of condolence at [[St James Palace]]. Throughout the night members of the [[Women's Royal Voluntary Service]] and the [[Salvation Army]] combined to provide support for people queuing along the Mall.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/diana/mourn.html |publisher=BBC  |title=Public Mourning Continues <U+2013> Royal Family "Deeply Touched"|accessdate=11 November 2007}}</ref> More than one million bouquets were left at her London home, [[Kensington Palace]], while at her family's estate of [[Althorp]] the public was asked to stop bringing flowers, as the volume of people and flowers in the surrounding roads was said to be causing a threat to public safety.

By 10 September, the pile of flowers outside Kensington Gardens was 1.5 metres deep in places and the bottom layer had started to compost.<ref>''The Independent'', 10 September 1997.</ref> The people were quiet, waiting patiently in line to sign the book and leave their gifts. There were a few minor incidents. Fabio Piras, a Sardinian tourist, was given a one-week prison sentence on 10 September for having taken a teddy bear from the pile. When the sentence was later reduced to a <U+00A3>100 fine, Piras was punched in the face by a member of the public when he left the court.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1997/09/11/ndi411.html|title=Punch in face for teddy bear thief|last=Dutter|first=Barbie|date=11 September 1997|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |accessdate=8 June 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040913114236/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1997/09/11/ndi411.html|archivedate=13 September 2004}}</ref> The next day, Maria Rigociova, a 54-year-old secondary school teacher, and Agnesa Sihelska, a 50-year-old communications technician, were each given a 28-day prison sentence for having taken eleven teddy bears and a number of flowers from the pile outside St. James' Palace.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19970912/ai_n14132484/pg_1 |title=Women jailed for Abbey thefts }} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}, ''The Independent'', 12 September 1997.</ref> This too was later reduced to a fine (of <U+00A3>200 each) after they had spent two nights in prison.

Some criticised the reaction to Diana's death at the time as being "hysterical" and "irrational". As early as 1998 philosopher [[Anthony O'Hear]] identified the mourning as a defining point in the "sentimentalisation of Britain", a media-fuelled phenomenon where image and reality become blurred.<ref>O'Hear, Anthony (1998) 'Diana, Queen of Hearts: Sentimentality personified and canonised" in Anderson and Mullen ''Faking It: The sentimentalisation of modern society'', Social Affairs Unit ISBN 978-0-907-63175-0</ref> These criticisms that were repeated on the 10th anniversary, where journalist [[Jonathan Freedland]] expressed the opinion that "It has become an embarrassing memory, like a mawkish, self-pitying teenage entry in a diary,... we cringe to think about it." In 2010, [[Theodore Dalrymple]] wrote "sentimentality, both spontaneous and generated by the exaggerated attention of the media, that was necessary to turn the death of the princess into an event of such magnitude thus served a political purpose, one that was inherently dishonest in a way that parallels the dishonesty that lies behind much sentimentality itself".<ref>{{cite book

==Reactions==
===Royal family===
The reaction of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] to Diana's death caused unprecedented resentment and outcry. They were at their summer residence at [[Balmoral Castle]], and their initial decision not to return to London or to mourn more publicly was much criticised at the time. Their rigid adherence to [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]], and their concern to care for Diana's grieving sons, was interpreted by some{{Specify|date=August 2010}} as a lack of compassion.

In particular, the refusal of [[Buckingham Palace]] to fly the [[Royal Standard (United Kingdom)|Royal Standard]] at [[half-mast]] provoked angry headlines in newspapers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Flags at half mast for Diana |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/138289.stm |date=23 July 1998 |publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=22 October 2007}}</ref> "Where is our Queen? Where is her Flag?" asked ''The Sun''. The Palace's stance was one of royal protocol: no flag could fly over Buckingham Palace, as the Royal Standard is only flown when the Queen is in residence, and the Queen was then in Scotland. Furthermore, the Royal Standard never flies at half-mast as it is the Sovereign's flag and there is never a dead Sovereign (the new monarch [[The King is dead. Long live the King.|immediately succeeds]] his or her predecessor).

Finally, as a compromise, the [[Union Flag]] was flown instead, at half-mast, as the Queen left for Westminster Abbey on the day of Diana's funeral. This set a precedent, and [[Flags at Buckingham Palace|Buckingham Palace has subsequently flown the Union Flag]] when the Queen is not in residence.

The Queen, who returned to London from Balmoral, agreed to a television broadcast to the nation.

===Public reactions===
Over a million people lined the four-mile (6 km) route from Kensington Palace to [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/6/newsid_2502000/2502307.stm |title=On this day 6&nbsp;September&nbsp;1997 |publisher=BBC  |accessdate=30 October 2007 | date=6 September 1997}}</ref> Outside the Abbey and in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] crowds watched and listened to proceedings on giant outdoor screens and huge speakers as guests filed in, including representatives of the many charities of which Diana was patron.

BBC. 6 September 1997.</ref> In a private ceremony, Diana was buried on the [[Althorp|Althorp estate]] on an island in the middle of a lake. In her casket, she wears a black [[Catherine Walker (fashion designer)|Catherine Walker]] dress and is clutching a [[rosary]] in her hands. A visitors' centre is open during summer months, allowing visitors to see an exhibition about her and to walk around the lake. All profits made are donated to the [[Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund]].

During the four weeks following her funeral, the overall suicide [[suicide rate|rate]] in England and Wales rose by 17% and cases of [[Self-injury|deliberate self harm]] by 44.3%, compared with the average reported for that period in the four previous years. Researchers suggest that this was caused by the "[[identification (psychology)|identification]]" effect, as the greatest increase in suicides was by people most similar to Diana:  women aged 25 to 44, whose suicide rate increased by over 45%.<ref>{{cite journal |Hawton K, Harriss L, Simkin S, Juszczak E, Appleby L, McDonnell R, Amos T, Kiernan K, Parrott H. |title=Effect of death of Diana, princess of Wales on suicide and deliberate self-harm. |last1=Hawton |first1=Keith |last2=Harriss |first2=Louise |last3=Simkin |first3=Sue |last4=Jusczcak |first4=Edmund |last5=Appleby |first5=Louise |last6=McDonnell |first6=Ros |last7=Amos |first7=Tim |last8=Kiernan |first8=Katy |last9=Parrott |first9=Hilary |publisher=The Royal College of Psychiatrists |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |issue=177 |year=2000 |month=November |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/177/5/463 |accessdate=4 June 2010 |pages=463<U+2013>466 |pmid=11060002}}</ref>

In the years after her death, interest in the life of Diana has remained high. As a temporary memorial, the public co-opted the ''Flamme de la Libert<U+00E9>'' ([[Flame of Liberty]]), a monument near the Alma Tunnel, and related to the French donation of the [[Statue of Liberty]] to the United States. The messages of condolence have since been removed, and its use as a Diana memorial has discontinued, though visitors still leave messages at the site in her memory. A permanent memorial, the [[Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain]] was opened in Hyde Park in London on 6 July 2004.

Diana was ranked third in the 2002 ''[[100 Greatest Britons|Great Britons]]'' poll sponsored by the BBC and voted for by the British public, just above [[Charles Darwin]] (4th), [[William Shakespeare]] (5th), and [[Isaac Newton]] (6th).

In 2003, [[Marvel Comics]] announced it was to publish a five-part series entitled ''Di Another Day'' (a reference to the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Die Another Day]]'') featuring a resurrected Diana, Princess of Wales, as a mutant with superpowers, as part of [[Peter Milligan]]'s satirical ''[[X-Statix]]'' title. Amidst considerable outcry, the idea was quickly dropped.<ref>{{cite news |title=Princess Diana, superhero |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,984675,00.html |publisher=Guardian News and Media |work=The Guardian |location=London|date=25 June 2003 |accessdate=22 October 2007 | first=Peter | last=Milligan}}</ref> [[Heliograph Incorporated]] produced a roleplaying game, ''[[Diana: Warrior Princess]]'' by [[Marcus L. Rowland]], about a fictionalised version of the twentieth century as it might be seen a thousand years from now. Artist [[Thomas Demand]] made a video, ''Tunnel'', in 1999, that featured a trip through a cardboard mock-up of the tunnel in which Diana died.

After her death, the actor [[Kevin Costner]], who had been introduced to the Princess by her former sister-in-law, [[Sarah, Duchess of York]], claimed he had been in negotiations with the divorced Princess to co-star in a sequel to the thriller film ''[[The Bodyguard]]'', which starred Costner and [[Whitney Houston]]. Buckingham Palace dismissed Costner's claims as unfounded.<ref>{{cite web |title=Costner: Role to Di For |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,619348,00.html |work=People  |date=28 April 1998 |accessdate=22 October 2007}}</ref>

Actor [[George Clooney]] publicly lambasted several tabloids and paparazzi agencies following Diana's death. A few of the tabloids [[boycott]]ed Clooney following the outburst, stating that he "owed a fair portion of his celebrity" to the tabloids and photo agencies in question.<ref>{{cite news |work=TIME |title=Hey, wanna buy some pix? |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101970915-138281,00.html |date=24 June 2001 |author=Richard Zoglin |accessdate=22 October 2007}}</ref>

==Conspiracy theories==
{{Main|Death of Diana, Princess of Wales conspiracy theories}}
Although the initial French investigation found that Diana, Princess of Wales, had died as a result of an accident, the [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] persistently raised by [[Mohammed al-Fayed]] and the ''[[Daily Express]]'' suggested that she was assassinated. In 2004 a special [[Metropolitan Police]] inquest team, [[Operation Paget]], headed by the then Commissioner [[John Stevens, Baron Stevens of Kirkwhelpington|Lord Stevens]], was established to investigate the conspiracy theories.

A report with the findings of the criminal investigation was published on 14 December 2006. The inquest was closed following the conclusion of the British Inquest into the deaths in April 2008.

==2007 inquest==
Under [[English law]], an [[Inquest (England and Wales)|inquest]] is required in cases of sudden or unexplained death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/Death/WhatToDoAfterADeath/DG_066713|title=Coroners, post-mortems and inquests|work=[[Directgov]]|accessdate=8 June 2010}}</ref> The inquests into the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales, and Dodi Fayed opened on 8 January 2007, with Dame [[Elizabeth Butler-Sloss]] acting as [[Coroner of the Queen's Household|Deputy Coroner of the Queen's Household]] for the Diana inquest and Assistant Deputy Coroner for Surrey in relation to the Fayed inquest. Butler-Sloss originally intended to sit without a jury;<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1293183.ece |title=No jury for Diana inquest |author=Lee Glendinning |work=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers |date=15 January 2007 |accessdate=4 June 2010 | location=London}}</ref> this decision was later overturned by the High Court,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6411091.stm |title=Diana inquest to be heard by jury |publisher=BBC News  |date=2 March 2007 |accessdate=4 June 2010}}</ref> as well as the jurisdiction of the Coroner of the Queen's Household. On 24 April 2007, Butler-Sloss stepped down, saying she lacked the experience required to deal with an inquest with a jury.<ref name="inquests"/> The role of Coroner for the inquests was transferred to [[Scott Baker (judge)|Lord Justice Scott Baker]], who formally took up the role on 11 June as Coroner for Inner West London.

On 27 July 2007, Baker, following representations for the lawyers of the interested parties, issued a list of issues likely to be raised at the inquest, many of which had been dealt with in great detail by Operation Paget.

The issues identified were:

The inquests officially began on 2 October 2007 with the swearing of a jury of six women and five men. Lord Justice Scott Baker delivered a lengthy opening statement giving general instructions to the jury and introducing the evidence.<ref>{{cite web |title=Inquests into the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales and Mr Dodi Al Fayed: Hearing transcript <U+2013> 2&nbsp;October 2007 Morning |url=http://www.scottbaker-inquests.gov.uk./hearing_transcripts/021007am.htm |work=Coroner's Inquests into the Deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales and Mr Dodi Al Fayed |publisher=Judicial Communications Office |accessdate=4 June 2010 |year=2008}}</ref> The BBC reported that Mohammed Al-Fayed, having earlier reiterated his claim that his son and Diana were murdered by the Royal Family, immediately criticised the opening statement as biased.<ref>{{cite news | title = BBC Report of First Day of Inquests, see video report with Nicholas Witchell|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7023227.stm | date=2 October 2007 | accessdate=2 January 2010 |publisher=BBC News }}</ref>

The inquest heard evidence from people connected with Diana and the events leading to her death, including [[Paul Burrell]], Mohamed Al-Fayed, her stepmother, the survivor of the crash, and the former head of [[MI5]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Al Fayed gets his 'moment' in court|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7250241.stm |publisher=BBC News  | date=18 February 2008 | accessdate=2 January 2010 |first=Caroline |last=McClatchey}}</ref>

==Internet coverage==
Diana's death occurred at a time when internet use in the developed world was booming, and several national newspapers and at least one British regional newspaper had already launched online news services. [[BBC News]] had set up online coverage of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|general election]] earlier in 1997<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freshnetworks.com/blog/2008/06/major-events-influenced-bbcs-news-online/ |title=Major events influenced BBC<U+2019>s news online , Social media agency London , FreshNetworks blog |publisher=Freshnetworks.com |date=5 June 2008 |accessdate=30 April 2011}}</ref> and as a result of the widespread public and media attention that Diana's death resulted in, BBC News swiftly created a website featuring news coverage of Diana's death and the events that followed it. Diana's death helped BBC News officials realise how important online news services were becoming, and a full [[BBC News Online|online news service]] was launched on 4 November that year.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/diana/</ref>
