The '''alcohol laws of [[Kansas]]''' are among the strictest in the [[United States]], in sharp contrast to its neighboring state of [[Missouri]] (''see'' [[Alcohol laws of Missouri]]), but much like (though still stricter than) its other neighboring state of [[Oklahoma]] (''see'' [[Alcohol laws of Oklahoma]]). Legislation is enforced by the [[Kansas Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control]].

Kansas had statewide [[prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] from 1881 to 1948, longer than any other state, and continued to prohibit on-premises liquor sales until 1987.  Kansas's strict and heavily regulated approach to alcohol stems largely from lingering vestiges of Kansas's long era of prohibition.

Even today, 29 [[dry county|dry counties]] continue to prohibit all on-premises liquor sales. 

==History of liquor laws in Kansas==
[[Image:Topeka capital.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Kansas State Capitol]] in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]].]]
===Statewide prohibition of alcohol (1881-1948)===
In 1880, Kansas voters narrowly approved an amendment to the [[Wyandotte Constitution|Kansas Constitution]] prohibiting all manufacture and sale of "intoxicating liquors" throughout the state effective January 1, 1881, making Kansas the first state in the United States to enact a statewide prohibition on alcohol, and heralding Kansas's long era of statewide prohibition.<ref>Kansas Constitution, Article 15, Section 10 (1947)</ref><ref name="KLL">[http://skyways.lib.ks.us/ksleg/KLRD/Publications/Kansas_liquor_laws_2003.pdf "Kansas Liquor Law," Kansas Legislative Research Department (2003)]</ref> Kansas was a national center of activity of the [[temperance movement]]. [[Carrie A. Nation]] came from Kansas, beginning her efforts in 1888 by advocating enforcement of Kansas's new prohibition.

Nationwide prohibition went into effect with ratification of the [[18th Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States]] in 1919, lasting until repeal by the [[21st Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]] in 1933.  During this period, alcohol was prohibited in Kansas by both state and [[law of the United States|federal law]].  In 1934, shortly after the end of nationwide prohibition, a proposal was put to referendum that Kansas end its statewide prohibition, and regulate and tax liquor instead.<ref name="KLL"/>  Voters rejected it by a sizeable margin.<ref name="KLL"/>

Kansas's statewide prohibition amendment allowed the [[Kansas Legislature]] to define what constituted an "intoxicating liquor."<ref name="KLL"/> So, in 1937, the legislature passed a law defining [[low-point beer|beer with an alcohol content of 3.2% or less by weight]] as cereal malt beverage, or "CMB," thereby excluding CMB from the definition of "intoxicating liquor."<ref name="KLL"/> The new law also authorized sale of CMB for both on- and off-premise consumption throughout the state.<ref name="KLL"/>

Finally, in 1948, voters narrowly approved an amendment to the Kansas Constitution authorizing the legislature to "regulate, license and tax the manufacture and sale of
intoxicating liquor ... regulate the possession and transportation of intoxicating liquor."<ref name="KLL"/><ref>Kansas Constitution, Article 15, Section 10 (1948)</ref> The amendment also deemed the open saloon "forever prohibited."<ref name="KLL"/> This meant
that package (off-premises) liquor sales could be authorized and regulated, but that the prohibition of sale by the drink in public places (on-premises) continued.<ref name="KLL"/>

===Prohibition of sale by the drink (1948-1987)===
After the 1948 Amendment, the Legislature enacted the Liquor Control Act, which authorized off-premises sale in counties which had approved the 1948 Amendment, subject to a system of regulating, licensing, and taxing those sales.<ref name="KLL"/> The Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control, or ABC, was created to enforce the Act.<ref name="KLL"/>

In 1965, the Legislature enacted laws permitting the sale of liquor in private clubs.<ref name="KLL"/> Clubs were exempt from the constitutional prohibition because they were not open to the public.<ref name="KLL"/> In 1970, voters rejected by a slim margin of 10,000 a proposal to repeal the constitutional prohibition on open saloons.<ref name="KLL"/> In 1979, the Legislature permitted on-premises sales of liquor by the drink in private clubs, leading many existing CMB saloons to start selling liquor but charge the consumer a one-time "membership fee."<ref name="KLL"/>

In the 1970s, Kansas Attorney General Vern Miller, who served from 1971 to 1975, brought a new bout of enforcement of Kansas's prohibition, even raiding [[Amtrak]] trains traveling through Kansas to stop illegal liquor sales.<ref>"The attorney general's race: state's top cop has developed long arm," ''The Lawrence Journal World'', July 14, 2002</ref> He also forced airlines to stop serving liquor while traveling through Kansas airspace.<ref>"Former A.G. eyeing run for old job as sheriff," ''Topeka Capitol-Journal'', October 21, 1999</ref> Today, it is likely that these restrictions would be found unconstitutional under the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Granholm v. Heald]]'', 544 U.S. 460 (2005).

Finally, in 1986, the electorate voted to repeal the prohibition on open saloons in Kansas, effective January 1, 1987.<ref name="KLL"/> The Legislature thereafter amended the Liquor Control Act to regulate and license sales of alcohol in bars in any county which had approved the 1986 Amendment or did so subsequently and only in towns with a population of 11,000 (lowered to 5,000 in 2000).<ref name="KLL"/> Sunday sale of liquor was prohibited, but Sunday sale of CMB was permitted in restaurants deriving more than 30% of their profits from food.<ref name="KLL"/> All of these new establishments and allowances were subject to a 10% "drink tax."<ref name="KLL"/> Grocery stores were prohibited from selling anything besides 3.2% beer.<ref name="KLL"/>

===Recent developments===
In 2003, the District Court of [[Wyandotte County, Kansas|Wyandotte County]] ruled that the ban on Sunday liquor sales was unconstitutional because it did not apply uniformly to all communities.<ref name="LJW">"Sunday liquor sales flat in Lawrence," ''Lawrence Journal-World'', November 23, 2003</ref> The [[Kansas Supreme Court]] upheld the ruling.<ref name="LJW"/>" By then, two counties and 23 cities had adopted laws permitting Sunday liquor sales.<ref name="LJW"/> Eventually, effective November 15, 2005, the Legislature amended the Liquor Control Act to permit cities and counties to allow Sunday liquor sales, except on [[Easter]] Sunday and [[Christmas]] when it falls on a Sunday.<ref>"Prohibition on Sunday liquor sales abolished," ''Lawrence Journal-World'', May 2, 2005</ref>

Today, 25 counties, known as "[[dry county|dry counties]]," continue to prohibit all on-premises liquor sales.  The majority of Kansas communities still prohibit Sunday liquor sales.

To this day, Kansas never has ratified the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]].

==Liquor sales==
Kansas law divides alcohol into six categories, each of which is regulated differently.<ref name="KLL"/> "Alcoholic liquor" includes spirits, wine, and beer containing over 3.2% alcohol by weight; spirits are defined as any distilled alcoholic beverage, including brandy, rum, whiskey, and gin, among others.<ref name="KLL"/>  A "cereal malt beverage" is beer containing less than 3.2% alcohol by weight.<ref name="KLL"/> A "nonalcoholic malt beverage" is beer containing less than 0.5% alcohol by weight.<ref name="KLL"/> "Domestic table wine" is wine containing 14% or less alcohol by volume, manufactured by farm wineries in Kansas from products grown in Kansas.<ref name="KLL"/> "Domestic fortified wine" is wine containing between 14% and 20% alcohol by volume, similarly made in Kansas.<ref name="KLL"/> "Domestic beer" is beer containing 8% or less alcohol by weight and is manufactured by microbreweries from Kansas-grown agricultural products.<ref name="KLL"/>

Regulations governing liquor sale and taxation are enforced by the ABC.<ref name="KLL"/>  It has broad rule-making authority.<ref name="KLL"/> All liquor sales are subject to a 10% "drink tax" on gross receipts of any business which sells liquor, either as a distributor, off-premises, or on-premises.<ref name="KLL"/>

Kansas lifted the ban on the importation of alcohol from other states other than by a licensed distributor in 2009. Before this, it was illegal for private citizens to order beer, wine, or liquor from out of state breweries or wineries, including by telephone, internet, and mail order.

===Distribution===
Kansas has a [[Three-tier (alcohol distribution)|three-tier liquor distribution system]].<ref name="KLL"/> That is, alcohol subject to control is distributed from manufacturer to distributor to retailer.<ref name="KLL"/> The only exceptions are that farm wineries and microbreweries may sell directly to the consumer, and establishments may purchase beer and bulk wine directly from wholesalers.<ref name="KLL"/>

===Off-premises===
Off-premises liquor sales are only allowed in licensed liquor stores.<ref name="KLL"/> Grocery stores and gas stations may sell CMB.<ref name="KLL"/> Retail liquor stores are licensed by the state, and CMB retailers are licensed by the city or county.<ref name="KLL"/>

====Retail liquor stores====
A retail liquor store licensee must have been a United States citizen for 10 years, a resident of Kansas for 4 years, must never have been convicted of a felony, a crime of [[moral turpitude]], a liquor law violation, must never have had a prior license revocation, must be 21 years of age, must not be in the business of law enforcement, and the licensee's spouse must meet the same qualifications.<ref name="KLL"/> Retail liquor stores may sell beer, wine, spirits, and nonalcoholic malt beverages.<ref name="KLL"/> They may be licensed CMB retailers as well.<ref name="KLL"/>

Sales are prohibited on [[Thanksgiving]], Easter, and Christmas.<ref name="KLL"/> Sales are prohibited between 11:00 PM and 9:00 AM.<ref name="KLL"/> Cities and counties which allow off-premises sales are prohibited from allowing Sunday liquor sales after 8:00 PM, but may not require retail liquor stores to close before 8:00 PM on other days.<ref name="KLL"/> No sales are allowed at less than cost.<ref name="KLL"/> All employees must be at least 21 years of age.<ref name="KLL"/>

A retail liquor store must be in an area zoned for commercial use, cannot be located within {{convert|200|ft|m}} of a school, college, or church, and cannot have an indoor entrance or an opening which connects with another business.<ref name="KLL"/> Except for [[Kansas Lottery]] tickets (which incidentally can be sold to 18-year-olds), it may not sell ''any'' product besides liquor, products or materials included by the manufacturer in the package, and nonalcoholic malt beverages.<ref name="KLL"/> It may not provide any entertainment, including pinball machines.<ref name="KLL"/>

====CMB retailers====
A CMB licensee must be a United States citizen, must have been a resident of Kansas for one year, must have been a resident of the county in which the business is located for six months, must not have had a felony conviction in the preceding two years, must never have had a conviction for a crime of moral turpitude, drunkenness, DUI, or any liquor violation, must be at least 21 years of age, and the licensee's spouse must meet the same qualifications.<ref name="KLL"/> CMB retailers may sell cereal malt beverages or nonalcoholic malt beverages.<ref name="KLL"/>

Sales are prohibited between midnight and 6:00 AM. Sales are allowed at less than cost.<ref name="KLL"/> All employees must be at least 18 years of age.<ref name="KLL"/> Cities and counties regulate the locations at which CMB retailers may not be located.<ref name="KLL"/>

===On-premises===
As discussed above, Kansas did not allow public on-premises liquor sales from 1881 to 1987. Except in clubs, liquor by the drink today is specifically prohibited except where voters have
approved its sale.<ref name="KLL"/> The 1986 constitutional amendment which allowed liquor by the drink authorized the Legislature to provide for liquor by the drink in establishments that derive 30% or more of gross receipts from the sale of food.<ref name="KLL"/> Permits only can be issued in those counties which have approved liquor by the drink.<ref name="KLL"/> If a county did not approve the amendment, it can hold a subsequent county referendum in which voters may: (1) prohibit liquor by the drink in that county; (2) remove the minimum food sale requirement; or (3) permit liquor by the drink in places that meet the 30 percent minimum food sale requirement.<ref name="KLL"/>

Today, 29 [[dry county|dry counties]] never approved the 1986 amendment and therefore continue to prohibit any and all sale of liquor by the drink.<ref>[http://www.ksrevenue.org/abcnoliq.htm Kansas Department of Revenue: Counties with No Liquor by the Drink]</ref> On-premises sales are illegal in these dry counties. 59 other counties (including [[Johnson County, Kansas|Johnson County]], the largest county in Kansas and the largest Kansas portion of the [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area]]) approved the 1986 amendment with the food sales requirement.<ref>[http://www.ksrevenue.org/abcliq30.htm Kansas Department of Revenue: Wet Counties - Counties with Liquor by the Drink with 30% Food Requirement]</ref> Only 17 counties in Kansas approved the 1986 amendment without limitation and allow liquor to be sold by the drink on-premises without any food sales requirement.<ref>[http://www.ksrevenue.org/abcliqnofood.htm Kansas Department of Revenue: Wet Counties - Counties wih Liquor by the Drink and No Food Requirement]</ref> The counties which are entirely "wet" include most of those with Kansas's larger cities, such as [[Douglas County, Kansas|Douglas]], where [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]] and the [[University of Kansas]] are located, [[Sedgwick County, Kansas|Sedgwick]], where [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] is located, [[Shawnee County, Kansas|Shawnee]], where [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]] is located, and [[Wyandotte County, Kansas|Wyandotte]], where [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]] is located. The counties which are home to [[Fort Riley]], a large [[United States Army]] base, [[Geary County, Kansas|Geary]] and [[Riley County, Kansas|Riley]], are also totally wet. Riley County's seat, [[Manhattan, Kansas|Manhattan]], is home to the state's other large college campus, [[Kansas State University]].

In those counties which allow liquor to be sold on-premises by the drink, clubs and drinking establishments, as well as microbreweries and farm wineries, may sell beer, wine, spirits, nonalcoholic malt beverages, and cereal malt beverages any day, but not between 2 AM and 9 AM.<ref name="KLL"/> Drinks "on the house" are prohibited.<ref name="KLL"/> No sales are allowed at less than cost.<ref name="KLL"/> "All you can drink" promotions are prohibited.<ref name="KLL"/> Drinks cannot be offered as prizes.<ref name="KLL"/> "Happy hour" promotions are banned, instead allowing only all-day specials to avoid binge drinking during a certain timeframe.<ref name="KLL"/> An increased alcohol content in a drink must result in proportional increase in price.<ref name="KLL"/> Free food and entertainment are permitted.<ref name="KLL"/> Employees must be at least 21 years of age to mix and dispense drinks, but may be at least 18 years of age to serve drinks.<ref name="KLL"/> Samples of drinks, such as beer, cannot be given.

==Open container==
Open containers of alcohol are prohibited outside of private buildings and licensed on-premises alcohol sellers.<ref name="KLL"/> An open container is prohibited inside any motor vehicle, unless it is a licensed limousine or mass-transit vehicle.<ref name="KLL"/> Public intoxication is prohibited.<ref name="KLL"/>

Kansas's open container law meets the requirements of the federal [[open container law|Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century]] for prohibiting open containers in vehicles.<ref>[http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/research/OpenContainer/status_conformance.htm United States Department of Transportation - Open Container Law Conformance]</ref>

==DUI==
Like every other state in the United States, [[driving under the influence]] is a crime in Kansas, and is subject to a great number of regulations outside of the Liquor Control Act.<ref name="KLL"/> Kansas's maximum blood alcohol level for driving is .08% for persons over the age of 21 and .02% for adults under the age of 21 and minors.<ref name="KLL"/>

Ordinarily, DUI is a [[misdemeanor]] in Kansas, although the third DUI conviction becomes a felony.<ref name="KLL"/>  Refusal to take a chemical test (i.e. [[breathalyzer]]) when so requested by a law enforcement officer who has [[probable cause]] will result in a one-year suspension of the suspect's driver's license.<ref name="KLL"/>

==Minors and alcohol in Kansas==
In response to the [[National Minimum Drinking Age Act]] in 1984, which reduced by 10% the federal highway funding of any state which did not have a minimum [[drinking age]] of 21, the Kansas Legislature raised the drinking age from 18 to 21, effective January 1, 1985.<ref name="KLL"/> Persons under 21 are prohibited from purchasing or possessing alcohol, from consuming alcohol for anything other than religious or prescribed medicinal purposes, or from having a blood alcohol level of more than .02%.<ref name="KLL"/> There is no discretionary parental exception.
