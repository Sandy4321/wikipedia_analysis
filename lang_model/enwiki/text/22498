'''Charlene Edna "Lenny" Robinson'''<ref>{{cite episode|title=Episode 523|series=Neighbours|serieslink=Neighbours|credits=Executive producer: Reg Watson; Director: Rod Hardy; Writer: Ray Harding|network=[[Network Ten]]|airdate=1 July 1987}}</ref> (previously '''Mitchell''') is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'' played by [[Kylie Minogue]]. Charlene was introduced to the show along with several new characters, as part of a revamp by [[Network Ten]] to increase ratings. Minogue auditioned for the role in 1985, shortly after finishing her high school exams. She attended the audition dressed as the character and casting director [[Jan Russ]] cast her in the role. Minogue was initially contracted for a week, but this was later extended through to mid-1988. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 17 April 1986.

Charlene was portrayed as a feisty, quick tempered and outspoken [[tomboy]]. She had a difficult relationship with her mother and did not like being patronised. Minogue thought viewers liked the character as she was an average Australian teenager. Reinforcing her tomboyish image, Charlene trained as a mechanic and she often wore khaki overalls and baggy sweatshirts. Her relationship with [[Scott Robinson (Neighbours)|Scott Robinson]] ([[Jason Donovan]]) was central to many of her storylines. They became a popular couple with viewers and the relationship helped boost ratings for ''Neighbours''. Despite breaking up several times during their first 12 months together, the couple stayed together and their relationship eventually culminated in a wedding during "[[Episode 523 (Neighbours)|Episode 523]]", which was first broadcast on 1 July 1987.

After releasing two successful singles, Minogue decided to leave ''Neighbours'' to concentrate on her music career. She filmed her final scenes in June 1988 and Charlene made her final screen appearance on 26 July. Minogue won four [[Logie Awards]] for her portrayal of Charlene, including the [[Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television|Gold Logie]], becoming the youngest person to do so. Critical reaction to the character has been positive. ''Soap Opera'' author Dorothy Hobson said Charlene broke stereotypes when it came to careers for women in the 1980s.

==Creation and casting==
After the [[Seven Network]] dropped ''Neighbours'' in 1985, rival channel [[Network Ten]] picked the series up.
