The '''North Atlantic Radio System''' (NARS) was a chain of five [[tropospheric scatter]] communication sites that stretched from [[Iceland]] to [[RAF Fylingdales]], forming an extension of the [[Distant Early Warning Line]]  ([[DEW Line]]). 

==Development==
Built for the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) during the early 1960s by [[Western Electric]] ([[AT&T]]), the sites were maintained under contract by [[ITT Federal Electric Corporation]] (now ITT Federal Services Corp.).<ref name = <U+201D>NARS<U+201D>>http://www.northatlanticradiosystem.com/abtnars.htm</ref>
The NARS network relayed Air-Defence radar data from co-located radars at each site, sending and receiving data via large fixed billboard style antennae, which bounced their signals off the bottom of the [[Troposphere]], hence tropospheric scatter. Although not a part of the ([[DEW Line]]), the NARS connected with the North American network at a common site in [[Iceland]], also providing connectivity for the [[Ballistic Missile Early Warning System]] (BMEWS) site at [[RAF Fylingdales]].<ref name = <U+201D>NARS<U+201D>/>

==NARS sites==
From 1960 the troposcatter sites were built as:-
; Site 41 <U+2013> [[Keflavik, Iceland]]<ref>http://www.northatlanticradiosystem.com/dic.htm</ref>
:Serving DYE-5, the USAF's DEW Line radar at [[Rockville, Iceland]].<ref>http://www.lswilson.ca/dewline.htm#H</ref>
; Site 42 <U+2013> [[H<U+00F6>fn, Iceland]]<ref>http://www.northatlanticradiosystem.com/htr.htm</ref>
:Connecting a co-located USAF radar.
;Site 43 <U+2013> [[T<U+00F3>rshavn, Faroe Islands]]<ref>http://www.northatlanticradiosystem.com/nat.htm</ref>
:Connecting a co-located [[Royal Danish Air force]] radar.
; Site 44 <U+2013> [[RAF Mormond Hill]]<ref>http://www.northatlanticradiosystem.com/moh.htm</ref>
:Near [[Fraserburgh]], connecting the radar at [[RAF Buchan]], co-located with an [[ACE High]] troposcatter station as well as LOS micrwave links.
; Site 46 <U+2013> [[RAF Fylingdales]]<ref>http://www.northatlanticradiosystem.com/fyl.htm</ref>
:Connecting the BMEWS radar.

The NARS used [[AN/FRC-39A(V)]] transmitting and receiving equipment, manufactured by [[ Radio Engineering Laboratories]], which could be configured for 1kW, 10kW or 50kW power output depending on the range and/or quality of signal required. NARS sites were configured for 10kW output, with the exception of site 41 in both directions and site 42's connection to site 41. Each set consisted of two transmitters and four receivers, for redundancy and to boost signal to noise ratios, using vacuum tube technology which proved time consuming to maintain at high levels of efficiency.<ref name = <U+201D>NARS<U+201D>/>
Levels of service proved extremely variable with the effects of weather and finicky equipment frequently causing loss of connection. Improvements were gained through improved maintenance procedures but did not change significantly until the introduction of solid state technology, with the system able to transmit at 9.6kbps, (a very fast internet connection for that time), by the time the system was closed down in 1992 after 30 years of service.<ref name = <U+201D>NARS<U+201D>/>
With the advent of satellite communications the days of the Troposcatter networks were over, but NARS was closed down early due to the loss of the DYE-2 DEW Line station in 1988, severing the networks connection with the rest of the DEW line. Site 46 also had to close to make way for the new BMEWS [[Phased Array Radar]] at [[RAF Fylingdales]].<ref name = <U+201D>NARS<U+201D>/>
