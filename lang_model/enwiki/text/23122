'''Warhill High School''' is a public [[high school]] operated by the [[Williamsburg-James City County Public Schools]] (WJCC). Serving the joint [[school division]] of the [[independent city]] of [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] and [[James City County, Virginia]], the school is located at 4615 Opportunity Way, in the [[Lightfoot, Virginia|Lightfoot]] area of the county.

==Historic site==
The entire [[Historic Triangle]] area of the [[Virginia Peninsula]] is steeped in history dating back to the era of the British [[Colony of Virginia]] (1607<U+2013>1776) and later. West of the colonial capital (now [[Colonial Williamsburg]]), the old stage coach road to [[New Kent County, Virginia|New Kent County]] and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] (which became [[U.S. Route 60 in Virginia|U.S. Route 60]] in the 1920s), as well as Centerville and Longhill roads, all date to the pre-Revolutionary War period. The area where Lightfoot is now was known as the location of Six Mile Ordinary. (An ''ordinary'' was a colonial-era tavern with food and lodging for travelers and their horses). 

By tradition, the land at War Hill (or as it came to be called, Warhill) is named for an [[American Revolutionary War]] battle which took place there on June 26, 1781 between British troops under [[Lord Cornwallis]] and Allied forces under the [[Marquis Lafayette]]. Nearly 150 men were killed or wounded in the conflict, which occurred during the campaign that led to the victory at [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]], establishing independence for Virginia and the United States.

By the late 20th century, the {{convert|588|acre|km2|sing=on}} Warhill tract was one of the largest undeveloped parcels of land in the area. In 1996, it was purchased for public use. Located on Centerville Road near the interchange of U.S. Route 60 and [[Route 199 (Virginia)|State Route 199]], the land was envisioned as multi-purpose in James City County's "Master Plan." <ref>[http://www.timmons.com/news-and-events/VTC_0107.asp Public-private infrastructure act cleared way for new high school<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1999, the Warhill Sports Complex opened adjacent to the site of the new high school.<ref>[http://www.james-city.va.us/recreation/parks-trails/warhill-stadium.html Parks and Recreation: Warhill Stadium<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2005, construction began on the new Warhill High School.

==School history==
[[Image:Warhill High School.jpg|left|thumb|Warhill High School, opened in 2007]]
Warhill High School is Williamsburg-James City County's third high school, the newest since [[Jamestown High School (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Jamestown High School]]'s completion in 1997. The construction of Warhill was in response to the overcrowding issue at both Jamestown and [[Lafayette High School (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Lafayette High School]]. Serious talks about building a third high school began in 2001. In April 2007, Jamestown was reported to be about 350 students over the effective capacity, and Lafayette even more. 

Warhill High School opened to the public on August 28, 2007 and opened for the first day of school on September 4, 2007. 707 students were enrolled at Warhill High School; the number has risen consistently since the opening and is expected to continue to rise so as the surrounding community continues to grow. The school currently has about 1,150 students.

==Career and Technicial Education Center==
When it opened in 2007, the {{convert|243000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} facility at Warhill High School included a new state-of-the-art technology specialty center, offering Career and Technical Education (CTE) in the following career clusters: 
*Health, Human and Public Services<U+20AC>
*Electronics, Engineering and Scientific Technology
*Information Technology and Communication

Students from all three WJCC high schools are eligible to attend the new Career and Technical Education (CTE) courses at Warhill, which are offered in partnership with [[Sentara Health System]], which opened the modern [[Sentara Williamsburg Regional Medical Center]] nearby in Lightfoot in August 2006, and [[Thomas Nelson Community College]].<ref>[http://www.wjcc.k12.va.us/content/schools/warhill/index.shtml Welcome to Warhill High School<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Band Program==
The Warhill Band program is currently under the direction of Hunter Kopczynski. The founding director at Warhill was T. Jonathan Hargis. When Warhill first opened the band was made up of 49 members, with the majority of the students coming from Lafayette High School under the redistricting of James City County.  The band has since grown to 120 members and the achievements and reputation of the program continue to rise.  The band has competed well in recent years and was named a Virginia Honor Band for the 2010-2011 school year. The Warhill bands include the Marching Lions, Honors Band, Symphonic Band, two jazz ensembles, and a percussion ensemble.
