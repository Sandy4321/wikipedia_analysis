The '''1894<U+2013>95 season''' was the 14th season of competitive [[association football]] and third season in [[the Football League]] played by [[Small Heath F.C.]], an English football club based in [[Birmingham]]. In [[1893<U+2013>94 Small Heath F.C. season|1893<U+2013>94]], Small Heath finished in second place in the divisional championship and gained [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] by defeating [[Darwen F.C.|Darwen]] 3<U+2013>1 in a [[test match (association football)|test match]]. The club had struggled financially during the season, and there were suggestions that it might have disbanded had promotion not been secured. In their first season in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], they finished in 12th place in the 16-team division, thus avoiding the possibility of relegation via the test matches.

Small Heath entered the [[1894<U+2013>95 FA Cup]] at the first round proper, and for the second consecutive year lost in that round to the eventual losing finalists, who this season were [[West Bromwich Albion]]. In local competitions, they were eliminated in the semi-final of the [[Birmingham Senior Cup]], also by West Bromwich Albion, and lost to [[Aston Villa]] in the final of the [[Birmingham Charity Cup|Mayor of Birmingham's Charity Cup]]. The committee opted not to compete in the United Counties League, a supplementary competition.

Twenty-one different players represented the club in nationally organised competitive matches during the season and there were nine different goalscorers. Two players, [[Bill Purves]] and&nbsp;<U+2013> for the third consecutive season&nbsp;<U+2013> [[Billy Ollis]], appeared in every League match, and none of the first-choice eleven missed more than four League matches. The top scorer, for the second year running, was inside-forward [[Frank Mobley]] with 13&nbsp;goals. The match against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] attracted a crowd estimated at&nbsp;15,000, around double the highest attendance from previous years.

==Background==
Having won the inaugural [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title in 1892<U+2013>93 but missed out on [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] via the [[test match (association football)|test match system]], in 1893<U+2013>94 they finished second in the division and were promoted to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] by defeating [[Darwen F.C.|Darwen]] 3<U+2013>1 in the test match. The club had been in financial difficulty during the season, and the ''Birmingham Daily Post'' speculated that failure in the test match "would in all probability have meant the disbanding of the club".<ref name=testmatch>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=30 April 1894 |page=7}}</ref> The accounts showed income of <U+00A3>1,816 and expenditure of <U+00A3>2,039, a deficit of <U+00A3>222 on the year.<ref>{{cite news |title=Small Heath Football Club |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=21 June 1894 |page=5}}</ref> Nevertheless, in preparation for the new season, the club began work on a grandstand and relaid the pitch.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=6 August 1894 |page=3}}</ref>

==Review==

===September<U+2013>October===

Small Heath's First Division campaign began on Saturday 1&nbsp;September with a visit to local rivals and League champions [[Aston Villa]], which turned out rather closer than predicted. [[Jack Hallam]] opened the scoring from a [[Tommy Hands]] cross with the first League goal of the season, "for the match was started punctually, and it would have been a sheer impossibility to score faster than the Small Heath player did."<ref name=BDP0309/> Villa equalised some 20&nbsp;minutes later, took the lead immediately afterwards, and retained that lead to the end. The ''Birmingham Daily Post'' picked out Hallam and [[Caesar Jenkyns]] for praise, was disappointed by [[Fred Wheldon]], "usually the bright particular star of the front rank", and suggested that [[John Oliver (footballer)|Jack Oliver]] would be a success "when he has lost a little superfluous flesh".<ref name=BDP0309>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=3 September 1894 |page=5}}</ref>

On the Sunday, Jenkyns was involved in an incident after he and an acquaintance staked a [[quart]] of beer on a bicycle race. Solihull Police Court later heard how, after Jenkyns lost the race, he knocked his opponent off his bicycle, hit another man, and returned to the public house where he struck a third man in the face. He was convicted on three counts of [[common assault|assault]], and fined [[<U+00A3>sd|20s]] plus costs on each count.<ref>{{cite news |title=Solihull Police Court |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=5 September 1894 |page=7}}</ref> In the following day's visit to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], Small Heath had Oliver and [[Charles Partridge]] to thank for the score being restricted to 5<U+2013>0.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football |newspaper=Liverpool Mercury |date=4 September 1894 |page=7}}</ref> 

The new grandstand was open for the first home match of the season, against [[Bolton Wanderers]], and those spectators not distracted by the visit to the city of the Duke and Duchess of York (the future [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]) saw a much improved performance from the forwards that produced a 2<U+2013>1 win with goals from [[Frank Mobley]] and Wheldon.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=10 September 1894 |page=7}}</ref> The visit to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] ended in defeat by the same score. Oliver conceded a [[penalty kick]] for a foul on [[Charlie Reynolds (footballer)|Charlie Reynolds]], Wheldon equalised before half-time, and Wolverhampton regained the lead straight after the interval.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=17 September 1894 |page=5}}</ref>

"The surprise of Saturday's football" came when a late goal from Hands was enough to beat [[Preston North End]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=24 September 1894 |page=7}}</ref> though there was a suggestion in the press that the team would do well to moderate their tactics, which "were not of the gentlest".<ref>{{cite news |title=Sports and Pastimes |newspaper=Nottinghamshire Guardian |date=29 September 1894 |page=3}}</ref> For Preston's visit to [[Muntz Street|Coventry Road]] the following weekend, the club applied for a [[Alcohol licensing laws of the United Kingdom|licence to sell alcohol]] within the ground, as it was the only First Division club without such a licence. The application was refused, the licensing magistrate "remarking that if the public wanted drink they could go outside to get it."<ref>{{cite news |title=Small Heath Football Club |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=29 September 1894 |page=7}}</ref>

[[File:FredWheldonDart18980304.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Beneficiary Fred Wheldon|alt=Head and shoulders of a young clean-shaven man with dark hair parted on the left of centre. He is looking to his right, and is wearing a light-coloured sports shirt with dark collar and trim.]]The ''Leicester Chronicle'' suspected that "it will be a long time, perhaps, before we have another match so keenly contested".<ref>{{cite news |title=Football Notes |last='Linesman' |newspaper=Leicester Chronicle |date=6 October 1894 |page=3}}</ref> The visitors scored early on, but Small Heath's shoot-on-sight policy produced goals for Hands, after a clash with Mobley left Preston goalkeeper [[James Trainer]] on the floor, and for Wheldon, before [[Edward Brueton]], deputising in goal for the injured Partridge, let in a soft goal just before half-time. The second half brought "more finesse and less vigour" from the home side, but Preston grew stronger, took the lead, and Small Heath "appeared to be done with".<ref name=BDP0110/> Then Trainer could only turn Mobley's lob in off the post, the same player gave his side the lead, but "before the Small Heath contingent had finished congratulating one another",<ref name=BDP0110>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=1 October 1894 |page=5}}</ref> "North End charging down the field finely from the centre kick scored again before the whistle sounded" to make the final score 4<U+2013>4.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football |newspaper=The Standard |location=London |date=1 October 1894 |page=2}}</ref> Match receipts totalled nearly <U+00A3>250, a ground record.<ref name=BDP0110/>

After Wolverhampton Wanderers took a three-goal lead at Coventry Road, the ''Daily Post'' suggested that Caesar Jenkyns must have spent the interval "exhorting his men to make a famous effort", for "they responded nobly to his appeal".<ref name=BDP0810/> Adopting a strategy of all-out attack, running the ball upfield at full speed before crossing to as many of the forwards as could converge on goal, they scored four times in 25&nbsp;minutes to demoralise the opposition and win the match. The quality of Hands' movement and crosses was singled out for particular praise.<ref name=BDP0810>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=8 October 1894 |page=7}}</ref> Small Heath then played [[West Bromwich Albion]] in a [[benefit match]] for Fred Wheldon, who had first played for the club on trial in 1890, and since signing, before the 1890<U+2013>91 season, had not missed a game in League or FA Cup. Hands and triallist goalkeeper Charlie Williams of [[Swindon Town]] were injured during the game, and unfortunately for the beneficiary, only 2,000&nbsp;spectators turned up.<ref name=WheldonBenefit/>

A creditable performance in a losing cause at [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], marred only by the forwards' lack of composure in front of goal,<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=15 October 1894 |page=5}}</ref> was followed by the visit of [[Aston Villa]]. [[Bob Gordon (footballer)|Bob Gordon]] scored early, but thereafter was marked out of the game by Jenkyns. Villa had the better of the first half but Wheldon tied the scores from a penalty kick just before half-time; just after, the home side took the lead with "a determined and characteristic rush", but [[Dennis Hodgetts]] equalised, again from a penalty.<ref name=BDP2210/> The defences, Partridge and Jenkyns for Small Heath and the Villa backs in particular, had the best of the remaining time, and the match was drawn. After only four games, gate receipts, including the <U+00A3>450 paid by that day's 14,600&nbsp;spectators, already amounted to half that of the preceding season.<ref name=BDP2210>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=22 October 1894 |page=7}}</ref> Small Heath finished October with a 2<U+2013>2 draw on a waterlogged pitch at [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke]] which left them in ninth place in the League.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football |newspaper=The Standard |location=London |date=29 October 1894 |page=8}}<br>{{cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/division-one-old/1894-1895/table/1894-10-27 |title=English Division One (old) 1894<U+2013>1895 : Table on 27.10.1894 |publisher=Statto Organisation |accessdate=19 May 2011}}</ref>

===November<U+2013>December===

Three goals behind in the first 20&nbsp;minutes, Small Heath had fought back to level terms when a powerful shot from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]{{'s}} [[Alex Latta]] was given as a goal, despite having gone well wide, the referee believing it had passed through a hole in the net. [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]], former president of the League, suggested that it "was the worst decision he had seen since the establishment of the goal-nets", and Latta himself agreed that the ball had gone wide.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=5 November 1894 |page=7}}</ref> The crowd were unimpressed&nbsp;<U+2013> "ironical shouts of 'Goal' were the reception of any shots by Everton, of good or bad quality, that followed"&nbsp;<U+2013> until with ten minutes left, Jenkyns tied the scores with a header from a free kick.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football Notes |newspaper=Liverpool Mercury |date=5 November 1894 |page=7}}</ref> While confirming that the result had to stand, the League appointed a committee to look into the circumstances of the [[phantom goal]], and issued an instruction to referees to "inspect and observe the condition" of goalnets before each match in the future.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Football League |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=14 November 1894 |page=5 |quote=It was also resolved that instructions be sent out to referees, asking them to inspect and observe the condition of nets prior to the commencement of League games.}}</ref>

In contrast, Small Heath put on "a very indifferent display" in losing 4<U+2013>1 at [[West Bromwich Albion]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Football Notes |last='Linesman' |newspaper=Leicester Chronicle |date=17 November 1894 |page=3}}</ref> They scored twice, very much against the run of play, to come back from 2<U+2013>0 down to beat [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke]] 4<U+2013>2,<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=19 November 1894 |page=6}}</ref> and their good fortune continued at [[Bolton Wanderers]]. The home goalscorer, [[Alex Paton]], left the field injured before half-time, goalkeeper [[John Willie Sutcliffe]] was insistent that Jack Hallam's equaliser had been punched into the goal<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=26 November 1894 |page=7}}</ref>&nbsp;<U+2013> Hallam was equally insistent that it had not<ref name=BDP3Dec>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=3 December 1894 |page=5}}</ref>&nbsp;<U+2013> and after Wheldon scored Small Heath's winner, the referee ended the game a few minutes early. Bolton applied to the League for the match to be replayed because of the short time&nbsp;<U+2013> the referee admitted to having ended the game 2<U+00BD>&nbsp;minutes early, though not the 5&nbsp;alleged by Bolton&nbsp;<U+2013> but the result stood.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football Notes |newspaper=The Weekly Standard and Express |location=Blackburn |date=19 January 1895 |page=3}}</ref>

Unusually, Small Heath led at half-time at home to [[Sheffield United]]. [[Charlie Letherbarrow]], in only his second appearance for the club, scored after ten minutes and again approaching the interval to regain the lead. Between the two legitimate scores, he hit a swerving shot which looped up off the chest of goalkeeper [[William Foulke (footballer)|William Foulke]] and into the net, but the referee judged that the ball had been played in from behind the goal-line. In the second half, Wheldon converted a penalty kick when Foulke pushed Hallam out of the way as he attempted to reach a cross from Tommy Hands, and Letherbarrow completed his [[hat-trick]] as Small Heath won 4<U+2013>1.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football Notes |last='Linesman' |newspaper=Leicester Chronicle |date=8 December 1894 |page=2}}<br>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=3 December 1894 |page=5}}</ref> [[John Oliver (footballer)|Jack Oliver]] received a good reception when he returned to his former club&nbsp;<U+2013> Small Heath were introduced as "Oliver's team"&nbsp;<U+2013> but [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] took no pity, winning 7<U+2013>1.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=10 December 1894 |page=7}}</ref> At [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], an exciting game produced a 3<U+2013>1 defeat. The three home forwards worked as one, putting extra pressure on the centre of the visiting midfield, and the defence was unable to hold them out. The game was rough at times, Liverpool's [[Joe McQue]] attracting particular attention because of an incident in the corresponding match the previous season when Caesar Jenkyns was sent off for his violent reaction to McQue kicking Frank Mobley in the abdomen.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football Notes |newspaper=Liverpool Mercury |date=17 December 1894 |page=7}}<br>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=16 October 1893 |page=7}}</ref>

Playing a close-passing game that made them better able to cope with the high winds and blizzards that had caused the postponement of several League matches, [[Nottingham Forest]] earned themselves a Christmas bonus of [[<U+00A3>sd|10s]] a man for inflicting Small Heath's first home defeat of the season.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=24 December 1894 |page=7}}<br>{{cite news |title=Sports and Pastimes |newspaper=Nottinghamshire Guardian |date=29 December 1894 |page=3}}</ref> [[Boxing Day]] produced a 2<U+2013>0 defeat to a [[Sheffield Wednesday]] team playing a better all-round game,<ref>{{cite news |title=Yesterday's Football |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=27 December 1894 |page=7}}</ref> and the next day, Small Heath beat a touring Scottish Borderers side 11<U+2013>1.<ref name=BorderersFriendly/> Injury deprived Small Heath of four regular first-team players for the last game of the year, at home to Liverpool, and both [[Tilson Pritchard]] and [[Ernie Moore]] made their debuts at full-back. Jenkyns moved back to play behind the other half-backs to protect the understandably nervous reserves, and once the nerves wore off, Pritchard in particular "could scarcely be improved upon."<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=31 December 1894 |page=3}}</ref> Mobley opened the scoring in the first half, and with the wind behind them in the second half, Small Heath won 3<U+2013>0 to go into the new year in 10th place in the League.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football Notes |newspaper=Liverpool Mercury |date=31 December 1894 |page=7}}<br>{{cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/division-one-old/1894-1895/table/1894-12-29 |title=English Division One (old) 1894<U+2013>1895 : Table on 29.12.1894 |publisher=Statto Organisation |accessdate=19 May 2011}}</ref>

On a hard pitch in very cold weather, Small Heath had already conceded twice at [[Blackburn Rovers]] before [[Billy Ollis]] was injured midway through the first half and played no further part. The visitors put up a fight, but the numerical disavantage was too much for them and the final score of 9<U+2013>1 remains the club's joint-record defeat.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=7 January 1895 |page=7}}<br>{{cite news |title=Saturday's Football |newspaper=Glasgow Herald |date=7 January 1895 |page=10}}<br>{{cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/birmingham-city/records |title=Birmingham City : Records |publisher=Statto Organisation |accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref> With no competitive fixture scheduled for the next two weeks, the club undertook a tour. Their opening match, in [[Plymouth]], was the first visit of a professional club to the south-west of England. The Home Park club had ambitions to bring professional league football to the region, and in front of a crowd of 4,000 their team performed well before conceding three second-half goals.<ref name=PlymouthFriendly>{{cite web |url=http://www.greensonscreen.co.uk/argylehistory.asp?era=1890-1895#15 |work=Complete History of Plymouth Argyle |title=Chapter 2: 1890<U+2013>1895 |first=Roger |last=Walters |publisher=greensonscreen.co.uk |date=30 June 2011 |accessdate=19 July 2011}}</ref> Small Heath's tour ended with a 2<U+2013>1 defeat at [[Manchester City]],<ref name=Jan95Friendlies/> and they returned to a celebratory dinner in honour of the club's promotion to the First Division.

In a "remarkable encounter", [[Burton Swifts]] led 3<U+2013>2 at half-time in the [[Birmingham Senior Cup]] first round.<ref name=BSC1/> Their second goal was something of a freak, as an errant clearance by Purves was met on the volley and returned into the net by [[Davie Willocks]]. Swifts took a two-goal lead for a third time before Small Heath drew level, after which they "pressed hotly, but were kept out until twenty seconds from the finish, and when extra time seemed inevitable, Walton headed the ball through amidst great cheering" and the referee blew the final whistle.<ref name=BSC1/>

A visit to the Brine Baths at [[Droitwich Spa]] failed to help the players adjust to [[Nottingham Forest]]'s pitch, which had been flooded when the [[River Trent]] burst its banks a few days before.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sport and Games.

February opened with the [[FA Cup]] tie at home to [[West Bromwich Albion]]. Albion scored first, charging both ball and goalkeeper into the net, and doubled their lead after a misunderstanding between Oliver and Jenkyns. Half an hour into the game, Wheldon made a "characteristic" [[dribbling|dribble]], his shot was parried and Walton scored from the rebound. The pitch was very muddy, but the Small Heath forwards persisted with a close-passing game when "a kick and a rush would have served better",<ref name=BDP0204>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=4 February 1895 |page=7}}</ref> and although "the Birmingham enthusiasts nearly shouted themselves hoarse in encouraging the Heathens",<ref>{{cite news |title=Football Notes |newspaper=The Dundee Courier & Argus |date=4 February 1895 |page=5}}</ref> there were no more goals. A collection was taken at the match for the families of the 77&nbsp;miners killed in flooding at the Diglake Colliery, at [[Audley, Staffordshire]].<ref name=BDP0204/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.healeyhero.co.uk/rescue/pits/diglake/Diglake.htm |title=Diglake Colliery Flooding 1895 |first=John |last=Lumsdon |publisher=Fionn Taylor |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref>

[[Joe Fountain]] made his debut against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] as a late replacement for Wheldon, whose sister had died on the morning of the match. On a slippery pitch "thickly strewn with chaff and hayseeds", Small Heath fell a goal behind in a first half dominated by the defences of both teams.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=11 February 1895 |page=7}}</ref> The special training undertaken by the home side in preparation for the match took effect, as "in the closing stages they looked winners all over", and Sunderland had goalkeeper [[Ned Doig]] to thank for restricting the scoring to just Tommy Hands' equaliser.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football Notes |newspaper=The Dundee Courier & Argus |date=11 February 1895 |page=5}}</ref> The attendance of 15,000 was nearly double the highest recorded in previous seasons.<ref>Matthews (1995), ''Complete Record'', pp. 140<U+2013>42.</ref>

Both clubs having been eliminated from the FA Cup, Small Heath arranged a friendly with [[Notts County]], refereed by the [[Test cricket]]er and former [[England national football team|England international]] footballer [[William Gunn (cricketer)|Billy Gunn]], which gave them an opportunity to try out reserve players [[Jack Jones (association footballer born 1874)|Jack Jones]] and [[Alec Leake]]. On a hard, snow-covered pitch, Billy Walton scored all three goals in a 3<U+2013>3 draw, but the attendance of under a thousand, though understandable because of the weather conditions, was disappointing.<ref name=NottsFriendly/><ref>{{cite news |title=Sports and Pastimes |newspaper=Nottinghamshire Guardian |date=23 February 1895 |page=3}}</ref> Jones made his competitive debut, standing in for the injured Hallam, as Small Heath again struggled in muddy conditions and, for the fourth time this season, lost to West Bromwich Albion.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=25 February 1895 |page=7}}</ref>

Reserve [[Tom Watson (footballer born 1870)|Tom Watson]] replaced Partridge in goal and Hallam returned to the forward line for the second round of the Birmingham Cup, at home to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. Wheldon scored with two minutes left to take the lead, but the Wanderers still had time to tie the scores at 3<U+2013>3. After consulting both captains, the referee ordered half-an-hour's [[extra time]], but Wanderers, whose players had already returned to the dressing-rooms, refused to play, so Jenkyns claimed the game for Small Heath.<ref name=BSC2/>

===March<U+2013>April===

After seven defeats in the last nine League matches, Small Heath did little in the draw with [[Blackburn Rovers]] to allay the prospect of the relegation test matches. Numerous chances were wasted. According to the ''Birmingham Daily Post'', "not one of the forwards seemed capable of administering a sharp kick", and "have themselves to blame for not securing a victory".<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=4 March 1895 |page=7}}</ref> With five matches remaining, they were in 11th position in the League, but only two points clear of the test match zone.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/division-one-old/1894-1895/table/1895-03-02 |title=English Division One (old) 1894<U+2013>1895 : Table on 02.03.1895 |publisher=Statto Organisation |accessdate=19 May 2011}}</ref>

On a lighter note, the annual theatrical sports, hosted in conjunction with the Prince of Wales Theatre, featured a fancy-dress procession from the city centre to the Coventry Road ground for athletic events including sprint and {{convert|440|yd|adj=on}} races for the footballers (won by [[Caesar Jenkyns]] and [[Teddy Jolly]] respectively), a skipping race for the ladies of the theatre, [[sack race]] (won by [[Lupino family#Hook family|Harry Lupino]]) and [[egg-and-spoon race]] open to all, and a handicap race for the members of the orchestra&nbsp;<U+2013> the handicap being that they had to carry their instruments. The entertainment finished with a football match between Small Heath F.C. and a theatre XI, refereed by [[music hall]] artiste [[Vesta Tilley]]. Despite the cold wind and intermittent snow, the event attracted 8,000&nbsp;spectators and raised <U+00A3>100 for each of three local hospitals.<ref>{{cite news |title=Theatrical Sports at Small Heath |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=5 March 1895 |page=7}}</ref><ref name=MBCCF/>

Small Heath withdrew their claim to the Birmingham Cup match, and the [[Birmingham County Football Association|Birmingham Association]] ordered a [[replay (sports)|replay]], again at Coventry Road. This time round, Small Heath held on to their 3<U+2013>2 lead.<ref name=BSC2R/> The League match at home to [[Sheffield Wednesday]] was one of several victims of the weather. The referee had initially passed the ground fit for play, but continued heavy rain turned the pitch into a quagmire and forced a late postponement.<ref>{{cite news |title=Small Heath v.

The players went to [[Great Malvern|Malvern]] for special training before the home game with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. Joe Fountain was an "excellent" stand-in for the injured Tommy Hands at [[outside left]] and Jenkyns was "a tower of strength"<ref name=BDP2503/> as Wheldon scored the only goal of a scrappy game to bring Small Heath's points total to 22 with three matches left.

|} In their last game of the League season, away to [[Sheffield United]], Small Heath scored first when Foulkes' attempted clearance rebounded off his teammate [[Walter Hill (footballer)|Walter Hill]] into the net, and Mobley extended the lead after a break down the left by Hands. Although United came close to scoring from a second-half scrimmage when the ball appeared to cross the line, Small Heath held on to ensure their First Division survival with an unexpected victory.<ref>{{cite news |title=Notes on Sport |newspaper=Birmingham Daily Post |date=15 April 1895 |page=6}}<br>{{cite news |title=The Football League |newspaper=The Yorkshire Herald |date=14 April 1895 |page=7}}</ref>

After overturning a two-goal deficit to beat [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]] 4<U+2013>3 in a friendly at [[Manor Ground, Plumstead|Plumstead]],<ref name=ArseFriendly/> Small Heath took on [[Aston Villa]] in their last match of the season, the final of the Birmingham Charity Cup. Unfortunately for the charities, the weather was poor and the attendance low, but those spectators present saw an exciting game. Wheldon scored first with a fierce shot that entered the net off the goalkeeper and the underside of the bar, then [[Bob Chatt]] equalised from a free kick and [[Charlie Athersmith]] outpaced Oliver and his parried shot was forced over the line. Mobley tied the scores with a long shot, but in the second half with the wind behind them, Villa scored three times to Jack Hallam's one to take the match 5<U+2013>3.<ref name=MBCCF/>

==Summary and aftermath==
Small Heath conceded more goals than any other team in the division, but finished 12th of&nbsp;16, thus avoiding the risk of relegation via the test matches. Despite the misgivings of the ''Daily Post'' that "it cannot be expected that eleven or twelve men will stand the strain of a season's work amongst the first division clubs",<ref name=testmatch/> no member of the first-choice team missed more than four League matches. [[Bill Purves]] and [[Billy Ollis]] were ever-present, Ollis for the third season running, and [[Fred Wheldon]] missed a match for the first time in five years. Ten other men appeared at least once. [[Frank Mobley]] was leading scorer, with 13&nbsp;goals, followed by Wheldon with&nbsp;11; no other player reached double figures.<ref name=Mnew234/>

Goalkeeper [[Joe Fall]] signed from [[Manchester United F.C.|Newton Heath]] for a fee reported as <U+00A3>20,<ref>{{cite news |title=The Football League |newspaper=The Yorkshire Herald |date=17 June 1895 |page=8}}</ref> and defender [[Harry Haynes]] joined from [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Football. The Football League |newspaper=The Sheffield & Rotherham Independent |date=3 August 1895 |page=7}}</ref> The ''Dart'' thought that Jenkyns would be missed "a great deal more than some of [the] supporters imagine", and that apart from Fall, who was expected to be "a big improvement" on Partridge, the 1895<U+2013>96 team would be noticeably weaker than that of the season just ended.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football Arrows |newspaper=The Dart: The Birmingham Pictorial |date=30 August 1895 |page=4}}</ref>
