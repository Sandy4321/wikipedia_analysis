"'''The Power of Madonna'''" is the fifteenth episode of the [[United States|American]] television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''. The episode premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network on April 20, 2010. When cheerleading coach [[Sue Sylvester]] ([[Jane Lynch]]) demands that [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s music be played over the school intercom system, [[glee club]] director [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]) sets the club a Madonna-themed assignment, hoping to empower the female club members. "The Power of Madonna" was written and directed by series creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]], and serves as a musical tribute to Madonna, featuring [[cover version]]s of eight of her songs, with the singer having granted ''Glee'' the rights to her entire catalogue of music. ''[[Glee: The Music, The Power of Madonna]]'', an album containing [[studio recording]]s of songs performed in the episode, was released on April 20, 2010.

The episode was watched by 12.98 million American viewers, and was generally well-received by critics. Tim Stack of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and Aly Semigran of [[MTV]] both deemed it the best episode of the show thus far, while the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''{{'s}} Bobby Hankinson called it potentially "the most-enjoyable hour of television of all time."<ref name="BH"/> Other reviews were more mixed, with Todd VanDerWerff of [[The A.V. Club]] criticizing the increasing number of musical performances for disrupting the tonal balance of the show, and [[IGN]]'s Eric Goldman questioning the series' writing. Madonna herself approved of the episode, calling it "brilliant on every level".<ref name="Us"/>

==Plot==
Coach [[Sue Sylvester]] has her cheerleaders, or Cheerios, emulate [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], so that they will be more empowered in their cheerleading routines. Continuing her blackmail of [[Characters of Glee#Principal Figgins|Principal Figgins]] ([[Iqbal Theba]]) from "[[Sectionals]]", Sue has Madonna tracks played over the school intercom throughout the day. Glee club director [[Will Schuester]] overhears the girls in the club discussing difficulties they are having in relationships and life. [[Rachel Berry (Glee)|Rachel]] ([[Lea Michele]]) asks the other girls for advice on a boy pressuring her to have sex, while [[Tina Cohen-Chang|Tina]] ([[Jenna Ushkowitz]]) tells them that [[Artie Abrams|Artie]] ([[Kevin McHale (actor)|Kevin McHale]]) has asked her to start wearing more revealing clothes if she wants to be with him. When Will observes the Cheerios performing a routine with stilts to "[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray Of Light]]", he is inspired to set a Madonna-themed assignment to restore the girls to equal status. The male club members are unimpressed, even when the girls perform "[[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]]". As club co-captains, Rachel and [[Finn Hudson|Finn]] ([[Cory Monteith]]) also perform a [[Mashup (music)|mash-up]] of "[[Borderline (song)|Borderline]]" and "[[Open Your Heart (Madonna song)|Open Your Heart]]".

When Will ridicules Sue's fashion sense, club members [[Kurt Hummel|Kurt]] ([[Chris Colfer]]) and [[Mercedes Jones|Mercedes]] ([[Amber Riley]]) give her a makeover, recreating Madonna's "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]" video. [[Guidance counsellor]] [[Emma Pillsbury]] ([[Jayma Mays]]) is inspired by Madonna's example, and tells Will that she intends to lose her virginity to him that evening. [[Santana Lopez|Santana]] ([[Naya Rivera]]) offers to take Finn's virginity, and Rachel and her boyfriend Jesse ([[Jonathan Groff]]) also decide to have sex, leading to a dream sequence performance of "[[Like a Virgin]]" between all three couples. Ultimately, Emma and Rachel do not go through with it, but Finn does sleep with Santana. He later hides this from Rachel, having concluded that the sex was meaningless.

Jesse transfers to William McKinley High School, leaving his rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline to join New Directions, so that he and Rachel can be openly together. There is resistance from the group, who believe that this will result in fewer solos, and suspect that Jesse is a spy for his former club. In retaliation, Kurt and Mercedes join the Cheerios and perform "[[4 Minutes (Madonna song)|4 Minutes]]" with them during a school assembly. They tell Will that they were unhappy about never having solos, and will be in both groups. The boys sing "[[What It Feels Like For A Girl]]", and decide to treat the girls better. Artie apologizes to Tina for his prior misogynistic behavior, and they kiss. The episode ends with Finn welcoming Jesse into New Directions and letting him and Rachel know he won't interfere in their relationship, despite the fact that the two still have feelings for one another. The entire glee club sings "[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like A Prayer]]" backed by a gospel choir, with Kurt and Mercedes each having a solo in the song.
