'''ARA ''Moreno''''' was a [[Rivadavia class battleship|''Rivadavia''-class]] [[battleship]] in service with the [[Argentine Navy]]. She was the sister ship of [[ARA Rivadavia|ARA ''Rivadavia'']]. 

She was named after [[Mariano Moreno]], one of the members of the [[Primera Junta]], the first Argentinian government in May 1810. She was commissioned on 23 September 1911 and completed in March 1915. ARA ''Moreno'' was built by [[Fore River Shipyard|Fore River Ship and Engine Building Company]] under the 1908 programme. Along with here sistership, the [[ARA Rivadavia]], she was the only ship built in the United States with [[wing turret]]s.<ref>http://www.lostbattalion.com/t-bb_moreno.aspx</ref> She underwent large refits in the [[United States|US]] in 1924-25. ARA ''Moreno'' was finally sold for scrapping in February 1956, and scrapped in Japan. <ref name=hore/>

== Design ==
The ''Moreno''  displaced {{convert|27940|t|LT}} normally, and {{convert|30600|t|LT}} at full load. She was {{convert|176.02|m|ft}} at the waterline and {{convert|178.31|m|ft}} overall, with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|28.96|m|ft}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|8.53|m|ft}} at maximum load.<ref name=hore>Hore, pg 187</ref>

The ship was propelled by Curtis geared turbines. On trials, they developed {{convert|45000|ihp|kW|luk=on|0}} and drove the ship to a maximum speed of {{convert|23|kn|lk=on}}. 

The ships main armament were twelve [[12"/50 (30.5 cm) Bethlehem naval gun]]s mounted in six twin turrets, two each fore and aft, and one  on both the starboard and port sides of the ship. The guns could be depressed to -5<U+00B0> and raised to 15<U+00B0>. They fired a {{convert|394.6|km|lb}} at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|884|m/s|ft/s}} to a maximum range of {{convert|21950|km|yd}}.<ref name=hore/>These guns made the Rivadavia class the only class built in the U.S. with wing turrets.<ref name=hore/>These guns were augmented by a secondary qarmament of twelve {{convert|6|in|mm}}/50 caliber guns in six twin turrets.<ref name=hore/> Her tertiary armament was four {{convert|3|in|mm}} Anti-aircraft guns and 4 3-pounder guns to protect against torpedo boats along with six machine guns.<ref name=hore/> She also had 2 {{convert|21|in|mm}} submerged torpedo tubes.<ref name=hore/>

As with ''Rividavia'', ''Moreno'' was armoured at her belt, or water line, with {{convert|11.8|in|mm}} of armor. Her armor around the waterline near her bow was {{convert|5|in|mm}}, while around her stern was {{convert|4|in|mm}}. Her deck was {{convert|3|in|mm}} thick, while her conning tower was {{convert|12|in|mm|}}.<ref name=hore/> The main turrets were protected with {{convert|11.9|in|mm}} of armor, while the swecondary were protected with {{convert|6|in|mm}}.<ref name=hore/>

== Service ==
After their construction, both ''Rividavia'' and ''Moreno'' underwent a major refit in the [[United States]] from 1914 to 1926.<ref name=hore/> Following that, the ships participated in peacetime activities. ''Moreno'' participated in the 1937 Spithead Naval Review, and two years later, near the outbreak of World War 2, they visited [[Willhemsaven]]. ''Moreno'' did not fight in World War 2, and was scrapped in Japan in 1956.<ref name=hore/>
