'''William Roger Clemens''' (born [[August 4]], [[1962]], in [[Dayton, Ohio]]), is a professional baseball player, a [[starting pitcher]]. He last pitched for the [[New York Yankees]], and is one of the preeminent pitchers in [[Major League Baseball|major league]] history.  In 2006, a poll of 32 [[ESPN]] analysts named Clemens the greatest living pitcher.<ref>[[Peter Gammons|Gammons, Peter]], [http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=gammons_peter&id=2426053 "Ample living proof of Clemens' greatness"], ''[[ESPN|ESPN.com]]'', [[May 1]], [[2006]]</ref>  Clemens has won seven [[Cy Young Award]]s, two more than any other pitcher.  He throws and bats [[right-handed]].

Clemens debuted in the majors in 1984 with the [[Boston Red Sox]], where he played for 13 seasons. In 1997 he moved to [[Canada]] to pitch for the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] for two seasons; in both seasons  he won the pitching [[Triple crown (baseball)|triple crown]] (leading the league in wins, ERA, and strikeouts) and the [[Cy Young Award]]. 

He was traded to the [[New York Yankees]] for the 1999 season, where he had his first [[World Series]] success.  In 2003, he reached his 300th win and 4,000th strikeout in the same game. Clemens is one of only four pitchers to have more than 4,000 strikeouts in their career, along with [[Nolan Ryan]], [[Randy Johnson (pitcher)|Randy Johnson]], and [[Steve Carlton]].  Clemens played three seasons with the [[Houston Astros]], where he won his seventh [[Cy Young Award]].  He rejoined the [[New York Yankees]] during the [[2007 MLB season|2007]] season. 

On [[December 13]], [[2007]], Clemens' name was listed in the [[Mitchell Report (baseball)|Mitchell Report]], which alleged that he had used steroids and HGH during the 1998-2001 seasons.  Clemens has firmly denied these allegations, which as of yet, remain unconfirmed.  

==Early life==
Clemens' parents separated when he was an infant. His mother soon remarried Woody Booher, whom Clemens still considers his father. Booher died when Clemens was nine years old, and Clemens has said that the only time he ever felt jealous of other players is when he saw them in the clubhouse with their fathers.<ref name="22 Things">Story, Mark, [http://www.kentucky.com/mld/kentucky/sports/14749611.htm "22 Things You Should Know About 'Rocket' "], ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'', [[June 6]], 2006.</ref> After living in [[Dayton, Ohio]] until 1977, Clemens spent his high school years in [[Texas]]. At [[Spring Woods High School]] in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], Clemens also starred in football and basketball.<ref name="22 Things" /> He was scouted by the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and [[Minnesota Twins]] during his senior year, but opted instead to go to college.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.ign.com/articles/683/683734p1.html|title=Roger Clemens Interview|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2007-05-07|date=2005-01-26|last=Rogers|first=John}}</ref>

==College career==
He began his college career pitching for [[San Jacinto College North]] in 1981, where he was 9-2. The [[New York Mets]] selected Clemens in the 12th round of the 1981 draft, but he did not sign. He then attended the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]], compiling a 25-7 record in two [[All-American seasons]], and was on the mound when the Longhorns won the [[1983 College World Series]]. He became the first player to have his baseball uniform number retired at The University of Texas.<ref name="library">http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/C/Clemens_Roger.stm</ref> In 2004, the [[Rotary Smith Award]], given to America's best college baseball player, was changed to the [[Roger Clemens Award]], honoring the best pitcher.<ref>http://clemensaward.com/index.html</ref><ref>http://www.baseball-almanac.com/awards/roger_clemens_award.shtml</ref>

==Professional career==
===Boston Red Sox (1984-96)===
Clemens was drafted 19th overall by the [[Boston Red Sox]] in 1983 and quickly rose through the minor league system, making his major league debut on [[May 15]], {{by|1984}}. In 1986 his 24 wins helped guide the Sox to the [[1986 World Series|World Series]] and earned Clemens the [[American League]] [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|MVP]] award for the regular season.  He also won the first of his seven [[Cy Young Award]]s. 

[[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] slugger [[Hank Aaron]] angered the pitcher by saying that pitchers should not be eligible for the MVP. "I wish he were still playing," Clemens responded. "I'd probably [[beanball|crack his head open]] to show him how valuable I was."<ref name="22 Things" /> Clemens remains the only starting pitcher since [[Vida Blue]] in {{by|1971}} to win a league MVP award.

On [[April 29]], {{by|1986}}, Clemens became the first pitcher in history to [[strikeout|strike out]] 20 batters in a nine-inning major league game, against the [[Seattle Mariners]] at [[Fenway Park]]. Only [[Kerry Wood (baseball player)|Kerry Wood]] and [[Randy Johnson (pitcher)|Randy Johnson]] have matched the total. (Johnson's 20-strikeout performance was originally catalogued separately by MLB because it occurred in the first nine innings of an extra-inning game, but has since been accepted. [[Tom Cheney (baseball player)|Tom Cheney]] holds the record for any game: 21 strikeouts in 16 innings.)  Clemens attributes his switch from what he calls a "thrower" to a "pitcher" to the partial season Hall of Fame pitcher Tom Seaver spent with the Red Sox in 1986. <ref>"Sports Illustrated," October 1986</ref>

Clemens accomplished the [[List of pitchers who have struck out 18 or more batters in a nine-inning MLB game|20-strikeout feat]] twice, the only player ever to do so.  The second performance came more than 10 years later, on [[September 18]], {{by|1996}} against the [[Detroit Tigers]] at [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]]. Clemens's second 20-K day occurred in his second-to-last game as a member of the [[Boston Red Sox]].  

Clemens recorded 192 wins for the Red Sox, tied with [[Cy Young]] for the franchise record.  No Red Sox player has worn his #21 since Clemens left the team in 1996.

===Toronto Blue Jays (1997-98)===
Notoriously, Red Sox general manager [[Dan Duquette]] said Clemens was in the "twilight of his career" following four consecutive seasons, 1993-96, in which the pitcher was a mediocre 40-39 with few of the eye-popping statistics that had become his norm.  The Red Sox opted not to re-sign him following the 1996 season. However, the full quote from which "twilight" is excerpted was not entirely negative, and also referred to Red Sox management's stated hope that Clemens would spend his entire career with Boston.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

Clemens signed with the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] after the 1996 season, and won the Cy Young Award in both his seasons with the Blue Jays, also winning the pitching [[Triple crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] twice.  Some consider Clemens's tenure with the Blue Jays as his best individual seasons of his career, despite the lackluster records the Blue Jays had as a team.

In Clemens's first start in Fenway Park as a member of the Blue Jays ([[July 12]], [[1997]]) he pitched an inspired game, giving up only 4 hits and 1 run in 8 innings. 16 of his 24 outs were strikeouts, and every batter who faced him struck out at least once.<ref>[http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/B07120BOS1997.htm Retrosheet complete box score]</ref>

The emphasis on the 1996 "twilight" quote took on a life of its own following Clemens's post-Boston successes, and Duquette was vilified for letting the star pitcher go.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> As of the end of the 2006 season, Clemens's record since he left Boston is 156-67.<ref name="22 Things" />

===New York Yankees (1999-2003)===
Clemens was traded to the [[New York Yankees]] before the {{by|1999}} season for [[David Wells]], [[Homer Bush]], and [[Graeme Lloyd]]. In 1999 and {{by|2000}}, he won [[World Series]] titles with the Yankees.  Since his longtime uniform number #21 was in use by teammate [[Paul O'Neill (baseball player)|Paul O'Neill]], Clemens initially wore #12, before switching mid-season to #22.

Clemens's 2000 season was punctuated by a pair of notorious moments involving [[New York Mets]] catcher [[Mike Piazza]].  During a [[July 8]], 2000, game between the Mets and the Yankees, Clemens threw a high inside fastball to Piazza which bounced off Piazza's hand and hit him squarely in the head. Piazza had previously enjoyed great success as a hitter against Clemens (including a [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] against Clemens one month earlier), which was widely seen as Clemens's motivation.  The incident and its aftermath received intense media coverage.  Piazza bitterly criticized Clemens. And when both the Yankees and the Mets reached that year's [[2000 World Series|World Series]], there was great anticipation regarding the two men's first confrontation since the beaning.  

In Piazza's first at-bat of Game 2, his bat shattered, sending a large piece of the broken bat shard flying in Clemens' direction. Clemens picked it up and threw the broken bat down toward the first base line<U+2014>and near a jogging Piazza, missing him but clearing the benches of both teams.<ref>[[Jayson Stark|Stark, Jayson]], [http://espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs2000/2000/1022/833644.html "Clemens' bat toss adds confusion to Series"], ''ESPN.com'', October 23, 2000.</ref> Clemens later claimed that he was "fielding" the broken bat, having mistaken it (in his state of heightened [[adrenaline]]) for the baseball. His explanation was widely ridiculed,<ref>http://espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs2000/2000/1022/833644.html</ref> in part because pitchers fielding baseballs hit in fair territory don't typically throw them just to the left of home plate: Mets pitcher [[Al Leiter]] observed that "[i]f he felt that way, shouldn't he have thrown it to [Yankees first baseman] [[Tino Martinez|Tino [Martinez]]]?" (Clemens responded that upon realizing the "ball" to be a bat fragment, he threw it away in frustrated confusion.) Ultimately, Clemens was not ejected from the game, although he was later fined $50,000. Following the bizarre incident, he proceeded to shut down the Mets with 9 strikeouts, no walks and only 2 hits in 8 innings.  

In his previous start, in Game 4 of the [[2000 American League Championship Series|2000 ALCS]] against the Seattle Mariners, Clemens threw a 1-hit shutout while striking out 15. This contest was also marked by gamesmanship, as Clemens knocked down the Mariners' star hitter [[Alex Rodriguez]] twice during his first at-bat. (Rodriguez eventually walked, the only baserunner allowed by Clemens through the game's first six innings.)

In 2001, Roger Clemens became the first pitcher in history to start a season 20-1. He finished at 20-3 and won his sixth Cy Young Award.

Early in {{by|2003}}, Clemens announced his retirement, effective at the end of that season. On [[June 13]], 2003, pitching against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in [[Yankee Stadium]], Clemens recorded his [[300 win club|300th career win]] and 4,000th career strikeout, the only player in history to record both milestones in the same game. The 300th win came on his fourth try; the Yankee bullpen had blown his chance of a win in his previous two attempts. He became the 21st pitcher ever to record 300 wins and the third ever to record 4,000 strikeouts, joining [[Nolan Ryan]] (5,714) and [[Steve Carlton]] (4,136).  His career record upon reaching the milestones was 300-155; his record at the end of the season was 310-160 with 4,099 strikeouts. Clemens finished the season with a 17-9 record and a 3.91 ERA.  

The end of Clemens's 2003 season became a series of public farewells met with appreciative cheering. His last games in each AL park were given extra attention, particularly his final regular season appearance in [[Fenway Park]], when despite wearing the uniform of the hated arch rival, he was afforded a standing ovation by Red Sox fans as he left the field. (This spectacle was repeated when the Yankees ended up playing the Red Sox in that year's ALCS and Clemens got a second "final start" in his original stadium.) As part of a tradition of manager [[Joe Torre]]'s, Clemens was chosen to manage the Yankees' last game of the regular season. Clemens made one start in the World Series against the [[Florida Marlins]]; when he left trailing 3-1 after seven innings, the Marlins left their dugout to give him a standing ovation.

===Houston Astros (2004-06)===
Clemens chose to un-retire, signing a one-year deal with his adopted hometown [[Houston Astros]] on [[January 12]], {{by|2004}}, joining close friend and former Yankees teammate [[Andy Pettitte]]. On [[May 5]], {{by|2004}}, Clemens recorded his 4,137th career strikeout to place him second on the all-time list behind [[Nolan Ryan]].  He was named the starter for the National League All-Star team but ultimately was the losing pitcher in that game after allowing six runs on five hits including a three run home run to [[Alfonso Soriano]]. He finished the season with 4,317 career strikeouts, and his 18-4 record gave him a career record of 328-164.  After the season, he won his seventh [[Cy Young Award]], extending his record number of awards. He became the oldest player ever to win this award, at age 42. This also made him the fourth pitcher to win the award in both leagues, after [[Gaylord Perry]], [[Pedro Mart<U+00ED>nez]], and [[Randy Johnson (pitcher)|Randy Johnson]].  In Houston, Clemens wore # 22, his number with the Yankees, partly because Pettitte chose # 21, in Clemens' honor.

Clemens again decided to put off retirement before the {{by|2005}} season after the [[Houston Astros]] offered salary arbitration. The Astros submitted an offer of $13.5 million, and Clemens countered with a record $22 million demand. On [[January 21]], [[2005]], both sides agreed on a one-year, $18,000,022 contract, thus avoiding arbitration. The deal gave Clemens the highest yearly salary earned by a pitcher in [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] history. It also made him the sixth-highest paid player in baseball that year.

Clemens's 2005 season ended as one of the finest he had ever posted. His 1.87 ERA was the lowest in the major leagues, the lowest of his 22-season career, and the lowest by any National Leaguer since pitching great and contemporary rival [[Greg Maddux]] in 1995. He finished with a lackluster 13-8 record, primarily due to the fact that he ranked near 30th in run support. The Astros scored an average of only about 3.5 runs per game in games in which he was the pitcher of record. The Astros were [[shutout|shut out]] nine times in Clemens's 32 starts, and failed to score in a 10th until after Clemens was out of the game.  The Astros lost five Clemens starts by scores of 1-0. In April, Clemens did not allow a run in three consecutive starts. However, the Astros lost all three of those starts by a 1-0 score in [[extra innings]].

He has more career wins than any other right-handed pitcher of the [[Live Ball Era|live-ball era]]. On [[April 8]], {{by|2005}}, Clemens won his first start of the season against the [[Cincinnati Reds]], which tied him with [[Steve Carlton]] for second in wins for live-ball pitchers, and first among pitchers whose career began after [[World War II]]. However, it took him a month to surpass Carlton, as he was victimized by horrendous run support in a string of five starts that produced one loss and four no-decisions. On [[May 9]], he finally got his second win of the season against the [[Florida Marlins]], giving him 330 for his career. Only left-hander [[Warren Spahn]] is ahead of Clemens in wins among live-ball pitchers.  Passing Carlton also gave Clemens more wins than any pitcher alive. The only current pitcher with a reasonable chance of passing Clemens is Maddux, who now has 343 wins to Clemens's 353 and is nearly four years younger. 

Clemens won an emotional start on September 15th, following his mother's death that morning<ref>usatoday.com, [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/games/2005-09-14-marlins-astros_x.htm?csp=36 Clemens wins one for his late mother], accessed January 27, 2007 </ref>.  In his final start of the 2005 season, Clemens got his 4,500th strikeout. On [[October 9]], {{by|2005}}, Clemens made his first relief appearance since 1984, entering as a pinch hitter in the 15th, then pitching three innings to help the Astros defeat the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the longest postseason game in MLB history. The game ran 18 innings, and Clemens picked up the win.

After the NLCS victory, Clemens's 2005 season ended disappointingly, as he lasted only two innings in Game 1 of the [[2005 World Series]]. The Astros went on to lose all four games of the franchise's first World Series to the [[Chicago White Sox]].  A hamstring pull had hampered Clemens's performance since at least September.

The Astros declined arbitration to Clemens on [[December 7]], {{by|2005}}, which prevented them from re-signing him before [[May 1]], {{by|2006}}. The Astros, Rangers, Red Sox, and Yankees expressed an interest in signing him, but Clemens implied that he was finally retiring after his Team USA was eliminated by Mexico in the second round from the 2006 World Baseball Classic on [[March 16]], 2006.[http://sports.yahoo.com/top/news;_ylt=Ai_ipdhobAB.ZBjP5UqlCX05nYcB?slug=ap-classic-us-mexico&prov=ap&type=lgns]  However, there was no formal retirement announcement.

On [[May 31]], [[2006]], following another extended period of speculation, it was announced that Clemens was coming out of retirement for the third time to pitch for the Astros for the remainder of the 2006 season. Clemens signed a contract worth $22,000,022 (his uniform number is # 22), which would have been the highest one-year deal in MLB history. But since Clemens did not play a full season, he received a prorated percentage of that: approximately $12.25 million. Clemens made his return on [[June 22]], [[2006]], against the [[Minnesota Twins]], losing to their [[rookie]] phenom, [[Francisco Liriano]], 4-2.  For the second year in a row, his win total did not match his performance, as he finished the season with a 7-6 record, a 2.30 ERA, and a 1.04 WHIP.  However, Clemens averaged just under 6 innings in his starts and never pitched into the eighth.

===New York Yankees (2007)===
Following what was becoming familiar annual speculation, Clemens unexpectedly appeared in the owner's box at Yankee Stadium on [[May 6]], {{by|2007}}, and made a brief statement: ''"Thank y'all. Well they came and got me out of Texas, and uhh, I can tell you its a privilege to be back. I'll be talkin' to y'all soon."'' It was simultaneously announced that Clemens had rejoined the Yankees roster<ref>[[Associated Press]], [http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/sports/AP-BBA-Yankees-Clemens.html "Roger Clemens Is Returning to the Yankees"], ''NYTimes.com'', May 6, 2007.</ref>, agreeing to a pro-rated one year deal worth $28,000,022, or about $4.5 million per month. <ref>{{cite web | last=Olney | first=Buster | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2887224 | title=If inclined, Yankees would need Rocket's OK on trade | publisher=ESPN The Magazine | date=[[2007-05-30]] | accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref> 

Clemens made his 2007 return on [[June 9]], defeating the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] with six innings of 3 -run, 5-hit, 2-walk, 7-strikeout pitching.  On [[June 21]], with a single in the 5th inning against the [[Colorado Rockies]], Clemens became the oldest New York Yankee to record a hit (44 years, 321 days).  On [[June 24]], Clemens pitched an inning in relief against the [[San Francisco Giants]].  It had been 22 years and 341 days since his previous regular-season relief appearance, the longest such gap in major league history.<ref>{{Citation| last =Kepner| first =Tyler| title =Yanks Let Winning Feeling Slip Away| newspaper =[[The New York Times]]| year =2007|date=June 25, 2007| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/25/sports/baseball/25yankees.html?_r=1&ref=sports&oref=slogin}}</ref>

On [[July 2]], Clemens collected his 350th win against the [[Minnesota Twins]] at [[Yankee Stadium]], giving up just two hits and one run over eight innings. Clemens is only the second pitcher to pitch his entire career in the [[live-ball era]] and reach 350 wins.  The other is Warren Spahn, whose catcher for his 350th win was [[Joe Torre]], Clemens' manager for his 350th.

After a disappointing postseason start on [[October 7]], in which he re-aggravated a hamstring injury, Joe Torre removed Roger Clemens from the team's lineup. He was replaced by left-hander [[Ron Villone]].<ref>{{Citation| last =Bastian| first =Jordan| title =Clemens off Yanks' Postseason Roster| newspaper =MLB.com| year =2007| url =http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071008&content_id=2257302&vkey=ps2007news&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb}}</ref>

==Postseason performance==

In the [[1986 ALCS]], Clemens pitched poorly in the opening game, watched the Boston bullpen blow his 3-0 lead in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 4, and then pitched a strong Game 7 to wrap up the series for Boston. The 1986 ALCS clincher was Clemens' first postseason career victory. He did not win his second until 13 years later.

After a bad start in Game 2 of the [[1986 World Series]], Clemens returned to the mound for Game 6, which would have clinched the World Series for the [[Boston Red Sox]]. Clemens left the game after 7 innings leading 3-2, but the Red Sox infamously went on to lose the game in the 10th inning, and subsequently, the championship. Clemens's departure was highly debated and remains a bone of contention among the participants. Red Sox manager [[John McNamara (baseball)|John McNamara]] claimed Clemens took himself out due to a blister, though Clemens strongly denies that.<ref name="slate">Nocera, Joseph, [http://www.slate.com/id/91141/ "Roger Clemens, Choke Artist"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]]'', October 10, 2000.</ref>

Clemens most explosive postseason failure came in the second inning of the final game of the [[1990 ALCS]] against the [[Oakland Athletics]], when he was ejected for arguing with an umpire, putting a dismal stamp on an A's sweep.<ref name="slate" /> He was suspended for the first five games of the {{by|1991}} season and fined $10,000.<ref name="library" /> Clemens had two other playoff no-decisions, in 1988 and 1995, both occurring while Boston was being swept.  Clemens's overall postseason record with Boston was 1-2 with a 3.88 ERA, and 45 strikeouts and 19 walks in 56 innings.

After surrendering the New York Yankees' only loss in the 1999 playoffs in a much-hyped contest with Red Sox ace [[Pedro Martinez]], Clemens began improving his postseason numbers. His 3-0 record in the World Series includes a must-win performance with New York down 2-0 in the 2001 series;<ref>Buscema, Dave, [http://www.recordonline.com/archive/2003/10/23/dbcol231.htm "Rocket's long, magic journey"], ''Times Herald-Record'' ([[Middletown, New York]]), October 23, 2003.</ref> then, in Game 7, it was Clemens who matched [[Curt Schilling]]; his start (6 innings, 1 run, 10 strikeouts) was forgotten in the wake of the Diamondbacks' famous ninth-inning comeback. In 2000, after losing two division series games to Oakland, Clemens pitched his most spectacular game as a Yankee in the [[2000 ALCS|ALCS]] against the [[Seattle Mariners]]: a complete game one-hitter with 15 strikeouts. Clemens's overall postseason record with the Yankees has been 7-4 with a 3.17 ERA, and 98 strikeouts and 35 walks in 102 innings.

For the Astros, Clemens was the losing pitcher in game 7 of the [[2004 NLCS]] against the St. Louis Cardinals, allowing 4 runs in 6 innings of work. Clemens's 2005 postseason was marked by highs and lows. In Game 4 of the NLDS against the Atlanta Braves, he made a dramatic emergency relief appearance, entering as a pinch-hitter (the first pinch-hitting appearance of his career), then pitching the 16th through 18th innings and collecting the series-ending win. However, during the [[2005 World Series|World Series]], a hamstring pull ended Clemens's start after two innings, as his hometown team lost to the eventual World Champion Chicago White Sox, 5-3. It was Clemens's only World Series appearance for the Astros.<ref>Associated Press, [http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=251022104 "Crede keys Chicago win with bat, glove"], ''ESPN.com'', October 22, 2005</ref> Clemens's overall postseason record with Houston was 4-2 with a 4.60 ERA, and 29 strikeouts and 15 walks in 41 innings. 

Through the end of 2006, Clemens's total postseason record is 14-10 in 34 starts, with a 3.75 ERA. Clemens' World Series record is 2-4 in 8 starts, with an ERA of 2.37.

==Controversy==
Clemens has been the focal point of several controversies. His reputation has always been that of a pitcher unafraid to throw close to batters. Clemens led his league in hit batsmen only once, in {{by|1995}}, but he has been among the leaders in several other seasons. This tendency was more pronounced during his earlier career, and has since tapered off. Still, Clemens' reputation precedes him. After the [[2000 American League Championship Series|2000 ALCS game]] against the Mariners where he knocked down future teammate [[Alex Rodriguez]] and then argued with him, [[Seattle Mariners]] manager [[Lou Piniella]] called Clemens a "headhunter."<ref>http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/2000/world_series/news/2000/10/22/mets_yankees_game2_ap/</ref> His beaning earlier that year of [[Mike Piazza]], followed by the notorious broken-bat incident in the [[2000 World Series]], cemented Clemens's surly, unapologetic image in the minds of many detractors. Clemens was ranked 9th all time in hit batsmen after the 2007 season,<ref>http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HBP_p_career.shtml</ref> though it has been pointed out that this is consistent with a long-time pitcher who uses the entire plate. 

Clemens has also attracted controversy over the years for his outspoken comments, such as his complaints about having to carry his own luggage through an airport and his criticism of [[Fenway Park]] for being a subpar facility.<ref>http://www.slate.com/id/2083648/</ref> On [[April 4]], [[2006]], Clemens made what some alleged to be,  a "racially insensitive" remark when asked about the devotion of Japanese and South Korean fans during the [[World Baseball Classic]]: "None of the dry cleaners were open, they were all at the game, [[Japan]] and [[Korea]]."<ref>[http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/14266593.htm "Anna Benson withdraws divorce papers"], ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'', April 5, 2006.</ref>  Toward the end of his career, his annual on-and-off "retirements" have revived a reputation for [[diva]]-ish behavior.<ref>{{cite web|title=Martinez is one diva the Mets must suffer|publisher=USA Today|date=2006-02-25|accessdate=2007-05-07|last=O'Conner|first=Mark|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/oconnor/2006-02-25-pedro_x.htm}}</ref>

Clemens has also received criticism for receiving special treatment from the teams that sign him.  While playing for Houston, Clemens was not obliged to travel with the team on road trips if he wasn't pitching.  His 2007 contract with the New York Yankees has a "family plan" clause that stipulates that he not be required to go on road trips in which he is not scheduled to pitch and allows him to leave the team between starts to be with his family.  These perks were publicly criticized by Yankee reliever [[Kyle Farnsworth]].<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref>  Most of Clemens' teammates, however, did not complain of such perks because of Clemens' success on the mound and valuable presence in the clubhouse.  [[Jason Giambi]] spoke for such players when he said. <U+201C>I<U+2019>d carry his bags for him, just as long as he is on the mound.<U+201D>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/07/sports/baseball/07clemens.html?pagewanted=all]

===Accusations of steroid use===
In [[Jose Canseco]]'s book, ''[[Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big]]'',  Canseco alleges that Roger Clemens had expert knowledge about steroids and suggested that he probably used steroids, based on the improvement in his performance after leaving the Red Sox.  While not addressing the allegations directly, Clemens was dismissive of Canseco, stating "I could care less" and "I've talked to some friends of his and I've teased them that when you're under house arrest and have ankle bracelets on, you have a lot of time to write a book."<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/19/sports/baseball/19roberts.html?ex=1266555600&en=7c424a5b17a88e31&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt</ref>  Clemens did admit to using the prescription pain reliever [[Vioxx]] before it was withdrawn from the market.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/19/sports/baseball/19roberts.html?ex=1266555600&en=7c424a5b17a88e31&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt|publisher=New York Times|date=2005-02-19|author=Roberts, Selena|title=Clemens Had a Fountain of Youth in Vioxx}}</ref>

Clemens also faced steroid scrutiny when it was reported that pitcher [[Jason Grimsley]] had allegedly named him, as well as [[Andy Pettitte]], as users of [[Doping (sport)|performance enhancing drugs]]. According to a 20-page search warrant affidavit signed by IRS Special Agent Jeff Novitzky, Grimsley told investigators he obtained amphetamines, anabolic steroids and human growth hormone from someone recommended to him by, former Yankees trainer [[Brian McNamee]]. McNamee was a personal strength coach for Clemens and Pettitte.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/articles/2006/10/01/clemens_named_in_affidavit/|title=Clemens named in affidavit|publisher=Boston Globe|date=2007-10-01|accessdate=2007-06-11}}</ref>  McNamee was hired by Clemens in 1997, the year in which he had one of the best seasons of his career. At the time of the Grimsley revelations, McNamee denied knowledge of steroid use by Clemens and Pettitte.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/jon_heyman/11/10/mcnamee.trainer/index.html The sixth man] ESPN.com, Nov. 14, 2006</ref>  Initial media reports alleged that Pettitte and Clemens were both named specifically on the Grimsely affidavit. These reports were shown to be false when the affidavit was released and made no mention of Clemens or Pettitte.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3163889 Contrary to report, Clemens, Pettitte not named in Grimsley affadavit] ESPN.com, Nov. 14, 2006</ref> 

Clemens' name was mentioned 82 times in the [[Mitchell Report (baseball)|Mitchell Report]] on steroid use in baseball.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22189702/ Mitchell Report hits Clemens, other stars hard] MSNBC.com</ref> In the report, McNamee stated that during the {{by|1998}}, {{by|2000}}, and {{by|2001}} baseball seasons, he injected Clemens with [[Winstrol]]. Clemens attorney Rusty Hardin denied the claims, calling McNamee "a troubled and unreliable witness" who changed his story in an attempt to avoid criminal prosecution. He noted that Clemens has never tested positive in a steroid test.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071213&content_id=2325308&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|title=Clemens denies claims in Mitchell Report|publisher=''[[Mlb.com]]''|date=2007-12-13|accessdate=2007-12-13}}</ref> Former US Senator [[George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell]], who prepared the report, has stated that he relayed the allegations to each athlete implicated in the report and gave them a chance to respond before his findings were published. 

On January 6, 2008, Clemens appeared on [[60 Minutes]] to address the allegations. He told [[Mike Wallace]] that his longevity in baseball was due to "hard work" rather than illegal substances and denied all of McNamee's assertions that he injected Clemens with steroids, saying that they "never happened".<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/01/03/60minutes/main3671585.shtml Clemens Vehemently Denies Steroid Use] CBSNews.com, Jan. 6, 2008</ref>  On January 7, Clemens filed a defamation lawsuit against McNamee, claiming that the former trainer lied after being threatened with prosecution.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/sports/baseball/08clemens.html?em&ex=1199854800&en=1893280eac6fd721&ei=5087%0A Clemens Files Suit Against Ex-Trainer] NY Times, Jan. 8, 2007</ref> Clemens and Hardin held a press conference that day, and revealed a recording of a January 4 phone conversation between McNamee and Clemens. Hardin noted that McNamee did not refute Clemens' denials of steroid use during the conversation, and argued that this should be considered as evidence that Clemens was being truthful.

==Other media==
Clemens has appeared as himself in several movies and television episodes. Perhaps best known was his appearance in the season three episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' ("[[Homer at the Bat]]") where he is hypnotized into thinking he is a chicken (he did his own clucking). Clemens has also made guest appearances as himself on the TV shows ''[[Hope and Faith]], [[Spin City]], [[Arli$$]], [[Saturday Night Live]]'' as well as in the movies ''[[Kingpin (film)|Kingpin]]'', and ''[[Anger Management]]''  <ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0166048/</ref> 

He appeared in the 1994 movie ''[[Cobb (film)|Cobb]]'' as an unidentified pitcher for the Philadelphia A's.<ref>http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Roger_Clemens</ref>.  In 2003, he was part of an advertising campaign for [[Armour and Company|Armour hot dogs]] with MLB players [[Ken Griffey Jr.]], [[Derek Jeter]], and [[Sammy Sosa]]. Since 2005, Clemens has also appeared in many commercials for Texas-based supermarket chain [[H-E-B]]. In 2007, he appeared on a baseball-themed episode of ''[[MythBusters]]'' ("[[MythBusters (season 6)#Episode 83 - Baseball Myths|Baseball Myths]]"). He has also starred in a recent commercial for Cingular parodying his return from retirement.  He was calling his wife and a dropped call resulted in his return to the Yankees.

He released an early autobiography, ''Rocket Man: The Roger Clemens Story'' written with [[Peter Gammons]], in 1987.
Clemens is also the spokesperson for Champion car dealerships in South Texas.

==Awards and recognition==
While he has two championship rings with the 1999-2000 Yankees, Clemens has also been on the losing end of four World Series (1986 Red Sox, 2001 and 2003 Yankees, and 2005 Astros), which is tied with [[Tom Glavine]] and [[John Smoltz]] (who were both on the Braves when they lost the '91, '92, '96 and '99 World Series) for the most among active players.

In {{by|1999}}, while many of his performances and milestones were yet to come, he ranked number 53 on ''[[The Sporting News]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was elected by the fans to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]]. In {{by|2005}}, the updated [[Sporting News]] list moved Clemens up to #15.

By the end of the 2005 season, Clemens had won seven Cy Young Awards (he won the AL award in 1986, {{by|1987}}, {{by|1991}}, {{by|1997}}, {{by|1998}}, and {{by|2001}}, and the [[National League]] award in {{by|2004}}), an MVP and two pitching triple crowns. With his 2004 win, he joined [[Gaylord Perry]], [[Randy Johnson (pitcher)|Randy Johnson]] and [[Pedro Martinez]] as the only pitchers to win it in both leagues and became the oldest pitcher to ever win the Cy Young.  He has also won [[The Sporting News Pitcher of the Year Award]] five times, was named an All-Star 11 times, and won the All-Star MVP in 1986.

In October 2006, Clemens was named to [[Sports Illustrated]]'s "all-time" team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballist.com/lists/sialltimeteam06.php|title=Sports Illustrated's All-Time Team, 10/2006|accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref>

On August 18th 2007, Roger Clemens got his 1,000th strikeout as a Yankee. He is only the ninth player in major league history to record 1,000 or more strikeouts with two different teams.

==Personal==
Clemens married Debra Godfrey on [[November 24]], [[1984]]. They have four sons: [[Koby Clemens|Koby Aaron]], Kory Allen, Kacy Austin, and Kody Alec - all given "K" names to honor Clemens' strikeouts ("K's"). Koby was drafted by the Astros as a third baseman and signed on [[July 14]], [[2005]], at the age of 18.  

Debra once left a Red Sox game, when Clemens pitched for another team, in tears from the heckling she received. She claimed that the bad attitude of Boston fans was the reason they never won the World Series. This is documented in an updated later edition to [[Dan Shaughnessy]]'s best-selling book, ''[[Curse of the Bambino]]''. 

Debra posed in a [[bikini]] with her husband for a ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' pictorial regarding athletes and their wives. This appeared in the annual ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition]]'' for 2003. Clemens was completely clothed, though his uniform jersey was open. <ref>http://www.debbieclemens.com/bio.htm</ref>

On [[February 27]], [[2006]], to train for the [[World Baseball Classic]], Roger pitched in an exhibition game between the [[Astros]] and his son's minor league team. In his first at-bat, Koby hit a [[home run]] off his father. In his next at-bat, Roger threw an inside pitch that almost hit Koby. Koby laughed in an interview after the game about the incident.
