== History ==
=== Broken Hill Proprietary Company ===
The '''Broken Hill Proprietary Company''' or '''BHP''' was incorporated in 1885, operating the silver and lead mine at [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] in western [[New South Wales]].<ref>[http://www.gabr.net.au/biogs/ABE0041b.htm Australian Business Records]</ref> In 1915, the company ventured into [[steel]] manufacturing, with its operations based primarily in [[Newcastle, New South Wales]].<ref name="steel">[http://www.bluescopesteel.com/index.cfm?objectid=A977A5D7-5328-43A0-9A599A171EC0B24F BlueScope Steel]</ref>  It is also known by the nickname "the Big Australian".<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5382/is_199808/ai_n21426068 Shrinking the Big Australian]</ref>

The company began petroleum exploration in the 1960s with discoveries in [[Bass Strait]], an activity which became an increasing focus.<ref>[http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/dpi/nrenmp.nsf/linkview/e1969d9710f16de2ca256ec8000b159884b1bca6986b5725ca256f56001a2d7f History of Petroleum Exploration in Victoria]</ref>

BHP began to diversify [[Offshoring|offshore]] in a variety of projects.  One project was the [[Ok Tedi Mine|Ok Tedi]] [[copper]] mine in [[Papua New Guinea]], where the company was successfully sued by the indigenous inhabitants because of [[the environment]]al damage caused by the mine operations.<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-18322244.html The big, ugly Australian goes to Ok Tedi]</ref> BHP had better success with the giant [[Escondida]] [[copper]] mine in [[Chile]] (57.5% owned) and the [[Ekati Diamond Mine]] in northern [[Canada]].<ref>[http://www.pwnhc.ca/timeline/index_winIFix.asp?forward=http%3A//www.pwnhc.ca/timeline/1975/Diamonds_1991.html#Scene_1 Discovery of Diamonds in North West Territories]</ref>

[[Image:BHP Logo.png||right|thumb|150px|Former Broken Hill Proprietary Company Corporate Logo]]

The inefficiencies of what was, by global standards, a small steel operation in Newcastle finally caught up with the company and the Newcastle operations were closed in 1999.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s55787.htm Steel City without the Big Australian]</ref> The 'long products' side of the [[steel]] business was spun off to form [[OneSteel]] in 2000.<ref>[http://www.delisted.com.au/CompanyDisplay.aspx?id=6175 One Steel]</ref>

In 2001, BHP [[merger|merged]] with the Billiton mining company to form BHP Billiton, the largest mining company in the world. In 2002, the 'flat products' steel business was spun off to form BHP Steel. In 2003, BHP Steel changed its name to [[BlueScope Steel]].<ref name="steel"/>

=== Billiton ===

'''Billiton''' was a mining company whose origins stretch back to [[29 September]] [[1860]], when the articles of association were approved by a meeting of [[shareholder]]s in the ''Groot Keizerhof'' [[hotel]] in [[The Hague]], Netherlands.<ref name="history">[http://www.bhpbilliton.com/bb/aboutUs/companyOverview/ourHistory/billitonHistory.jsp Billiton History]</ref>

Two months later, the company acquired the [[mineral rights]] to [[tin]]-rich islands of [[Bangka Island|Banka]]  and [[Belitung|Billiton]] in the Indonesian [[archipelago]], off the eastern coast of [[Sumatra]].<ref name="history"/>

Billiton's initial business forays included tin and [[lead]] smelting in The Netherlands, followed in the 1940s by [[bauxite]] mining in Indonesia and [[Suriname]]. In 1970, [[Royal Dutch Shell|Royal Dutch/Shell]] acquired Billiton and accelerated the scope of progress of this growth.<ref name="history"/> The tin and lead smelter in [[Arnhem]], Netherlands was shut down in the 1980s.

In 1994 Gencor acquired the mining division of Billiton excluding the downstream metal division.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE1DF1E3EF934A15754C0A962958260 Shell Unit Sells Assets To Gencor]</ref> Billiton was divested from Gencor in 1997.<ref>[http://www.btimes.co.za/97/0622/comp/comp.htm Gencor pops champagne]</ref> In 1997, Billiton Plc became a constituent of the [[FTSE 100 Index]].<ref name="history"/>

Throughout the 1990s and beyond, Billiton Plc experienced considerable growth. Its portfolio included aluminium smelters in [[South Africa]] and [[Mozambique]], [[nickel]] operations in [[Australia]] and [[Colombia]], base metals mines in [[South America]], [[Canada]] and [[South Africa]], [[coal]] mines in Australia, Colombia and South Africa, as well as interests in operations in [[Brazil]], Suriname, Australia ([[aluminium]]) and South Africa ([[titanium]] minerals and steel and ferroalloys).

In 2001 Billiton Plc  [[merger|merged]] with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company (BHP) to form BHP Billiton.<ref name="merger"/>

=== BHP Billiton Mergers and Acquisitions ===
In March 2005, BHP Billiton announced a [[USD|US$]]7.3 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] agreed bid for another mining company [[WMC Resources]], owners of the [[Olympic Dam]] uranium mine in [[South Australia]], nickel operations in Western Australia and [[Queensland]], and a fertiliser plant also in [[Queensland]]. The takeover achieved 90% acceptance on [[17 June]] [[2005]], and 100% ownership was announced on [[2 August]] [[2005]], achieved through compulsory acquisition of the last 10% of the shares.<ref>{{cite web|title=BHP Billiton to mop up minority in WMC after taking over 90 pct|publisher=Forbes.com|url=http://www.forbes.com/business/feeds/afx/2005/06/17/afx2098254.html|accessdate=August 13|accessyear=2007|date=2005-06-17}}</ref>

On [[November 8]], [[2007]], BHP Billiton announced it was seeking to purchase rival mining group [[Rio Tinto Group]] in an all-share deal. The initial offer of 3 shares of BHP Billiton stock for each share of Rio Tinto was rejected by the board of Rio Tinto for "significantly undervaluing" the company. It was unknown at the time if BHP Billiton would attempt to purchase Rio Tinto through some form of [[hostile takeover]]<ref name='bbctakeover'>{{cite news|first=|last=|coauthors=|title=BHP makes <U+00A3>120bn Rio bid approach|date=[[2007-11-08]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7084946.stm|work=BBC News Online|pages=|accessdate=2007-11-08|language=English}}</ref>; however, CEO Marius Kloppers met with many of Rio's shareholders since the announcement and reiterated that the offer for Rio was "compelling" and that BHP Billiton is very "patient." <ref name='FTBHPBRiotakeover'>{{cite news|first=|last=|coauthers=|title=BHP won't be drawn on a Rio sweetener|date=[[2007-11-28]]|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fe0b3904-9d88-11dc-9f68-0000779fd2ac.html|work=FT.com|pages=|accessdate=2007-11-28|language=English}}</ref> A formal hostile bid of 3.4 BHP Billiton shares for each Rio Tinto share was announced on [[February 6]], [[2008]]. <ref name='FTBHPBRiotakeover2'>{{cite web|title=BHP makes bid for Rio|date=[[2008-02-06]]|publisher=[[The Age]]|url=http://business.theage.com.au/bhp-makes-bid-for-rio/20080206-1qgf.html|pages=|accessdate=2008-02-06|language=English}}</ref>

On [[May 14]], 2008, BHP Billiton shares rose to a record high of [[Australian dollar|AU]] $48.90 after speculation than Chinese mining firm [[Chinalco]] was considering purchasing a large stake. BHP representatives refused to comment.<ref>{{cite web

=== Angola ===
Inclement weather caused a BHP Billiton helicopter to crash in [[Angola]] on [[November 16]], [[2007]], killing the helicopter's five passengers, including BHP's chief operation officer in Angola, David Hopgood.  The helicopter went down about 80 km/50 miles from Alto Cuilo Camp, a diamond mining site the employees wanted to visit. BHP Billiton responded by suspending operations in the country.  The company is investigating the incident.<ref name="angola">{{cite news|first=Angela|last=Macdonald-Smith|coauthors=|title=BHP Suspends Operations in Angola After Fatal Helicopter Crash|date=2007-11-18|publisher=Bloomberg|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&sid=af60OwUCJix8|work=|pages=|accessdate=2007-11-18|language=English}}</ref>

The United Nations Environment Programme has noted that BHP<U+2019>s Ok Tedi mine site<U+2019>s <U+201C>uncontrolled discharge of 70 million tonnes of waste rock and mine tailings annually has spread more than 1 000 km (621 miles) down the Ok Tedi and Fly rivers, raising river beds and causing flooding, sediment deposition, forest damage, and a serious decline in the area's biodiversity.<ref>[http://na.unep.net/digital_atlas2/webatlas.php?id=174 United Nations Environment Programme] Accessed on 16/12/07.</ref>   
The resulting devastation caused by the mining of Ok Tedi has included the loss of fish, a vital food source for the local community; loss of forest and crops due to flooding and; the loss of <U+201C>areas of deep spiritual value for villagers are now submerged in mine tailings.<U+201D><ref>[http://www.acfonline.org.au/articles/news.asp?news_id=93 Australian Conservation Foundation, <U+201C>Leaving the scene of the mine<U+201D>]</ref>
