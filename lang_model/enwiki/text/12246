'''Vildanden AS''' ("The Wild Duck") is a [[virtual airline (economics)|virtual]], [[regional airline]] based at [[Skien Airport, Geiteryggen]] in [[Norway]], where it is the only airline. With operations starting in 2005, it flies to [[Bergen]] and [[Stavanger]] using a [[Jetstream 32]] and a [[ATR 42]], which is [[wet lease]]d from [[Danish Air Transport]] (DAT) and [[Helitrans]]. Previously, the airline has also served [[Stockholm]] and [[Molde]], and has also operated [[Saab 340]] aircraft, operated by [[Coast Air]], [[Air Aurora]] and [[Avitrans]]. The airline has been in conflict with Coast Air about terminating the wet lease agreement. The company has had to be bailed out several times, including by the municipality, until it managed to make its first profit in 2009. Vildanden has plans to start a route to [[Trondheim]].

==History==
===Establishment===

Vildanden was founded on 23 November 2004 by 18 local investors who wanted to start commercial scheduled flights from Skien Airport, Geiteryggen. For a long period, there had been a public debate about closing the airport. Owned by the municipality, the airport was receiving annual subsidies of NOK&nbsp;2.5 million from the municipality, and NOK&nbsp;3.8 million from the state. It was decided to operate Vildanden as a [[virtual airline (economics)|virtual airline]] (one that owns none of its equipment, leasing everything from others), and [[wet lease]] operations from other companies.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.varden.no/apps/pbcs.dll/artikkel?AID=/20041023/NYHET/110230111 |title=Coast Air vil fly fra Geiteryggen |author=Tovik, Arne |authorlink=Arne Tovik |work=[[Varden]] |date=23 October 2004 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Initial plans had been started in 2003 to cooperate with Dutch airline [[Denim Air]], with a 50-seater aircraft, but these plans did not work out.<ref name=tungesvik>{{cite news |url=http://www.varden.no/apps/pbcs.dll/artikkel?AID=/20050922/NYHET/109220079 |title=Sprengfulle fly fra Geiteryggen |author=Tungesvik, Torbj<U+00F8>rn |work=[[Varden]] |date=22 September 2005 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

In October 2004, a contract was signed with [[Haugesund Airport, Karm<U+00F8>y|Haugesund]]-based [[Coast Air]], who would operate [[Jetstream 31]] aircraft between Skien and Bergen. The owner of Coast Air, Kystfly, also bought 20% of Vildanden.<ref name=lokkebo>{{cite news |url=http://www.ta.no/nyheter/article1426509.ece |title=Tar av i dag |author=L<U+00F8>kkeb<U+00F8>, Lars  |work=[[Telemarksavisa]] |date=24 January 2005 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Coast Air had previously operated routes from Skien to Western Norway, but had withdrawn in 1999.<ref>{{cite news |url= |title=Stakk i 99 |author= |work=[[Telemarksavisa]] |date=11 November 2004 |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Following the announcement from Vildanden and Coast Air, the municipality decided to not close the airport, and cover the estimated NOK&nbsp;300,000 annual deficit, as well as upgrade the [[control tower]] for NOK&nbsp;700,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ta.no/nyheter/article1338315.ece |title=Nytt ja til flyplassen |author=Johannessen, Bj<U+00F8>rn |work=[[Telemarksavisa]] |date=18 November 2004 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The airport had been closed since 2002, following the increased domestic and international traffic from near-by [[Sandefjord Airport, Torp]].<ref name=mayer>{{cite news |url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/naringsliv/article381073.ece |title=Vildanden tar av fra Skien |author=Meyer, Henrik D. |work=[[Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] |date=25 November 2004 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

Initial service would have 16 weekly departures to [[Bergen Airport, Flesland]]. The main market segment is the offshore petroleum industry, and the departure times were designed to mesh with helicopter routes to offshore installations. The company estimated that one-quarter of travellers would be people commuting to the [[North Sea]].<ref name=mayer /> [[Norsk Hydro]], who have a lot of employees in the Grenland area, stated that they could not start using Vildanden because they had an agreement with [[SAS Braathens]]' services from Sandefjord.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nrk_buskerud__telemark_og_vestfold/telemark/4302999.html |title=Hydro vil ikke fly fra Skien |author=Bolme, Stig and Holme, Lene |work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=29 November 2004 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The first scheduled service flew on 24 January 2005, carrying eight passengers.<ref name=lokkebo /> This first month, 972 passengers took the plane, and Vildanden announced that they would try to also start a route to [[Stavanger Airport, Sola]], as well as potentially to [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.varden.no/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050223/NYHET/102230090 |title=Planlegger nye ruter fra Skien |author=Haugen, Eirik |work=[[Varden]] |date=23 February 2005 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

===DAT in, Coast Air out===
[[File:Skien lufthavn - Geiteryggen.jpg|thumb|Vildanden is based at [[Skien Airport, Geiteryggen]]]]

On 19 April, a new [[Jetstream 32]] aircraft was taken into service. This allowed capacity to increase from 12 to 19 passengers, and at the same time travel time was reduced from 47 to 39 minutes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.varden.no/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050419/NYHET/104190126 |title=Med "Skien" til Bergen..... |author=Haugen, Eirik |work=[[Varden]] |date=19 April 2005 |accessdate=28 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> By September, the most popular departures were being booked full, and Vildanden asked Coast Air for a larger aircraft, with about 30 seats. In addition to allowing more passengers, larger planes would give higher comfort, and allow a more flexible ticket pricing scheme.<ref name=tungesvik /> An agreement with [[Danish Air Transport]] (DAT) to operate an [[ATR 42]], with a capacity of 48 seats, was signed in mid-October.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nrk_ostafjells/telemark/5137032.html |title=Vildanden flyr videre |author=Saga, Else Jorunn and Granli, Lene |work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=24 October 2005 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

To be able to breach the agreement with Coast Air<U+2014>who still had a wet leasing contract, but were not able to put into operation a larger aircraft<U+2014>the company Skien Lufttransport AS was created, and it purchased all the revenue and passenger rights from Vildanden. At the same time, it became the legal counterpart for DAT.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ta.no/nyheter/article1806865.ece |title=- Ville stjele passasjerene |author=Andersen, Trond |work=[[Telemarksavisa]] |date=1 November 2005 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The new aircraft was put into service on 31 October, branded with the Vildanden logo. Coast Air chose to continue operating the route between Bergen and Skien in their own name, and used the same aircraft and slot times. At Skien Airport, the Vildanden passengers were given the choice between Coast Air and Vildanden, and all nineteen chose Vildanden. On the return flight, three passengers chose each airline. Both aircraft flew to Skien, but due to heavy rain, only the aircraft from DAT was able to land. The passengers who had taken the Coast Air aircraft, were forced to land at Sandefjord Airport instead.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.varden.no/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050419/NYHET/104190126 |title=Full forvirring om flyavgangene |author=R<U+00F8>yseland, Halstein |work=[[Varden]] |date=1 November 2005 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

The following day, Coast Air terminated their flights, but stated that they still had an agreement with Vildanden. Skien Lufttransport on their hand stated that Vildanden was now a sleeping company, and that the contract therefore was terminated. Both companies considered the incident a legal matter.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.haugesunds-avis.no/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051107/NYHET/453328392 |title=Coast Air i <U+00AB>flykrig<U+00BB> |author=Horve, Mari |work=[[Haugesunds Avis]] |date=7 November 2005 |accessdate=28 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In December, the two companies settled outside court.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ta.no/nyheter/article1851756.ece |title=Flykrigen er over |author=Johannessen, Bj<U+00F8>rn |work=[[Telemarksavisa]] |date=2 December 2005 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

At the same time, the municipal council was considering the future of the airport. The city engineer estimated it would need a subsidy of NOK&nbsp;2 million in 2006, and the politicians, who wanted the airport to run without subsidies, demanded that Vildanden guarantee for the deficit.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.varden.no/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060105/NYHET/101050116 |title=Full forvirring om flyavgangene |author=Schulstok, Marit |work=[[Varden]] |date=5 January 2006 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> This was rejected by Vildanden<U+2014>on the contrary, the company was in dire need for more capital, and issued a private placement for NOK&nbsp;4 million in December 2005.

===More operators===
During 2006, the ridership increased, and Vildanden started becoming more aggressive against [[Wider<U+00F8>e]], which was flying to Bergen from Sandefjord Airport. Vildanden stated that they aimed to outperform Wider<U+00F8>e on price to Bergen.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sb.no/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060211/NYHETER/102110098 |title=Vil konkurrere om Bergen |author= |work=[[Sandefjords Blad]] |date=11 February 2006 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The ATR-42 turned out to be too large; from 1 July, operations was taken over by the Czech company [[Air Aurora]], with a smaller 30-seater [[Saab 340]]. This reduced the monthly leasing costs from NOK&nbsp;700,000 to NOK&nbsp;550,000. DAT remained responsible for the booking system.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ta.no/nyheter/article2214020.ece |title=Tsjekkerne overtar p<U+00E5> Geiteryggen |author=Tinholt, Dag |work=[[Telemarksavisa]] |date=29 July 2006 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> 

In October, an agreement was signed with the [[Avitrans]] of Sweden to take over operations.<ref>{{cite news |url= |title=Svensker skal fly for `Vildanden` |author= |work=[[Boarding.no]] |date=9 October 2006 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> This also included a second aircraft, so the airline could start operations to Stavanger and Molde in 2007.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.varden.no/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070104/NYHET/101040166 |title=Vildanden skal fly til  Molde og Stavanger |author=Tungesvik, Torbj<U+00F8>rn |work=[[Varden]] |date=4 January 2007 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> From 18 March, Vildanden also started three weekly departures from Skien to [[Stockholm-Skavsta Airport]]. The route was necessary to transport personnel from Avitrans' hub at Bromma to Skien.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boarding.no/art.asp?id=25697 |title="Vildandens" f<U+00F8>rste internasjonale avgang |author= |work=[[Boarding.no]] |date=13 March 2006 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

===Troubled times===
By October 2007, Vildanden was in severe financial distress. An agreement was made with the municipal council, where the latter gave a credit loan to the airline. The route to Molde had given large deficits, and the company was forced to close it down.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ta.no/nyheter/article3062859.ece |title=Unng<U+00E5>r konkurs? |author=Hjort-S<U+00F8>rensen, <U+00D8>rnulf  |work=[[Telemarksavisa]] |date=17 October 2007 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> NOK&nbsp;2.3 million, equal to the airlines debt to the airport, was granted to the municipal-owned airport operator, and the company allowed to make an agreement where half the debt was deleted, and the other half made interest and principal-free for two years. At the same time, the management of Vildanden had to raise new capital equal to at least half the companies [[accounts payable]], which was NOK&nbsp;8 million. The case raised local debate about whether it was the municipality's job to subsidize the airport and the airline. The [[Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries]] announced that they would consider reporting the subsidies to the [[EFTA Surveillance Authority]] (ESA) for violation of the [[European Community competition law]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ta.no/nyheter/article3084796.ece |title=Gransker Vildanden   |author=Madsen, <U+00D8>rjan  |work=[[Telemarksavisa]] |date=27 October 2007 |accessdate=8 March 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

The fiscal year 2007 gave a revenue of NOK&nbsp;61 million, and a deficit of NOK&nbsp;13 million.<ref name=gran /> During the airport strike in May 2008<U+2014>which closed Bergen Airport<U+2014>Vildanden had full planes since they could land them on the short runway at near-by [[Stord Airport, S<U+00F8>rstokken]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.h-avis.no/article/20080520/NYHETER/787966315 |title=Pengar flyg til Stord |author=Stautland, Kari |work=[[Haugesunds Avis]] |date=20 May 2007 |accessdate=28 January 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In 2008, 50,000 people used Skien Airport, most of whom flew with Vildanden.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.varden.no/article/20090106/NYHET/700814082 |title=Flere flyr fra Skien |author=Thorsen, Thom Erik |work=[[Varden]] |date=6 January 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

On 19 June 2008, the municipal council voted to not give further subsidies to the airport. Upgrades for NOK&nbsp;8 million were needed to meed safety standard. The airport operator had debt of NOK&nbsp;12 million, and no realizeable assets. Vildanden was under certain conditions willing to pay some of the capital needed to perform the upgrades.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.varden.no/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080620/NYHET/814377734 |title=Forland & co vil ta flyplassregningen |author=Thorsen, Thom Erik |work=[[Varden]] |date=20 June 2007 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The municipal council changed their opinion and voted<U+2014>with a single decisive vote<U+2014>to keep the airport running in July. The financial risk would be taken over by the municipal-owned Kontorbygg, who operate a range of offices and commercial buildings in Skien. The proposal was supported by the right-winged parties, and opposed by the socialist parties, as well as the chair of Kontorbygg.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ta.no/nyheter/article3649252.ece |title=Jublet for flyplassen |author=Johannesen, Bj<U+00F8>rn  |work=[[Telemarksavisa]] |date=4 July 2008 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> As a response, the Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries reported the municipality to ESA, and demanded that NOK&nbsp;20 million in illegal subsidies be repaid by Vildanden and the airport operator.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.varden.no/article/20080805/NARINGSLIV/381099293 |title=NHO vil stanse st<U+00F8>tte til Geiteryggen |author=Tungesvik, Thorbj<U+00F8>rn |work=[[Varden]] |date=5 August 2008 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

During the winter of 2008<U+2013>09, Vildanden was forced to land at Sandefjord Airport 50 times due to weather closing Geiteryggen.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sb.no/nyheter/meninger/bekrefter-torps-sterke-posisjon-1.1029095 |title=Bekrefter Torps sterke posisjon |author=Gran, Jon |work=[[Sandefjords Blad]] |date=7 March 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In March, Wider<U+00F8>e started a marketing campaign to attract people from Grenland to use their routes at Torp.

The reason was bad weather, which was described as "normal Norwegian rain" by the airline afterwards. This caused several commuters to miss their connecting flights on helicopters to offshore installations.
