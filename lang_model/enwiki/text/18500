'''Darkest Hour''' is an American [[metal]] band from Washington, D.C., formed in 1995.  Though failing to break early in their career, the band has received acclaim for their albums ''[[Undoing Ruin]]'', ''[[Deliver Us]]'', and ''[[The Eternal Return (album)|The Eternal Return]]''. ''Deliver Us'' debuted at number 110 on the [[Billboard 200|Billboard]] album charts, with sales of 6,600,<ref>Blabbermouth.net, [http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=77025 "Smashing Pumpkins, Darkest Hour, Danzig, Beatallica First-Week Sales Revealed"], Posted July 18, 2007.</ref> and their more recent effort ''The Eternal Return'' garnered them an even higher position in the Billboard album charts at number 104.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p366069/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} "Darkest Hour - Charts & Awards - Billboard Albums"] ''[[allmusic]]''. Retrieved on December 12, 2008.</ref>

==History==

=== Formation (1994<U+2013>1999) ===
Darkest Hour was formed on September 23, 1995,<ref>Kingtuts.co.uk [http://www.kingtuts.co.uk/events.html?cmd=find&artist_id=489 "Darkest Hour biography"], Posted December 10, 2006.</ref> and initially consisted of vocalist John Henry, guitarist [[Mike Schleibaum]], bassist Raul Mayorga and drummer Matt Maben.

The band released its first [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''[[The Misanthrope (album)|The Misanthrope]]'' in 1996 on a local label called Death Truck Records. In 1996, Darkest Hour cut a single titled "Paths of Despair" for East Coast Empire Records' ''The Harder They Come'' compilation. The song proceeds at a slower, grueling tempo in comparison to the up-beat tempo the band would come to be known for. In 1999, Darkest Hour released another EP titled ''[[The Prophecy Fulfilled]]'' on another label called [[Art Monk Construction]].

=== ''The Mark of the Judas'' and ''So Sedated, So Secure'' (2000<U+2013>2002) ===
The addition of second guitarist Fred Ziomek, bassist Billups Allen and drummer Ryan Parrish saw the band release their first full-length [[LP album|LP]] ''[[The Mark of the Judas]]'' in 2000, on the now-defunct M.I.A. Records.

''The Mark of the Judas'' was not widely promoted or distributed due to M.I.A. Records going out of business not long after the album's release.

Despite the fact Darkest Hour were left without a label, the band garnered enough exposure to catch the attention of [[Victory Records]]. Their Victory debut ''[[So Sedated, So Secure]]'' was released on August 7, 2001. After the release of the album, Billups was replaced by Paul Burnette and Ziomek left the band. The album was re-issued by Victory on March 7, 2006, and featured new artwork, re-mixed audio, re-recorded vocals and additional tracks.

The band continued to tour, with Schleibaum's longtime friend Mike Garrity filling in on lead guitar duties. Eventually, they accepted Parrish's old friend Kris Norris as the new lead guitarist, and then began to write their next record.

While Garrity was the guitarist, the band was arrested and jailed in [[Roland, Oklahoma]] for alleged marijuana charges, also for "illegally imported" beer and for an open beer can. They were fined $6000; Schleibaum was able to pay for himself, Burnette, and Garrity. Parrish and Henry had to stay for a couple of hours while the rest of the band had to get money to bail them out.<ref>Party Scars & Prison Bars: A Thrashography</ref>

=== ''Hidden Hands of a Sadist Nation'' and ''Undoing Ruin'' (2003<U+2013>2006) ===

Their third release ''[[Hidden Hands of a Sadist Nation]]'' was released on May 20, 2003. Produced by well-renowned Swedish record producer [[Fredrik Nordstr<U+00F6>m]], the album signaled a shift from the band's previous [[metalcore]] style to a more [[melodic death metal]] style. As a result, the album gained strong mainstream attention, allowing the band to perform at [[Ozzfest]] 2004. Notably, the album contained political lyrics, with several songs criticizing American militarism post-[[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11]]. The album was re-issued by Victory on July 13, 2004, with a bonus song and an additional DVD containing bonus material.

Darkest Hour released their fourth full-length LP ''[[Undoing Ruin]]'' on June 28, 2005. The album was produced by [[Devin Townsend]] ([[Strapping Young Lad]]) at Greenhouse Studios in [[Vancouver]]. The album was the band's first to enter the [[Billboard 200]] charts, debuting at No.&nbsp;138 with first week sales of 8,484.<ref>Blabbermouth.net, [http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=38915 "SOUNDSCAN REPORT: CKY, MEGADETH, DEVILDRIVER, DARKEST HOUR, THROWDOWN"], Posted July 6, 2005.</ref>

In the 2005 documentary ''[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]]'', Darkest Hour and a number of other bands including [[Shadows Fall]], [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], [[Chimaira]], [[Killswitch Engage]], [[Unearth]], and [[God Forbid]] are all listed under the category "[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey#"Definitive Metal Family Tree"|New Wave of American Metal]]" in the "[[Heavy metal music|metal]] genealogy chart".

=== ''Deliver Us'' (2007<U+2013>2008) ===

In April 2008, Darkest Hour created a [[Washington Capitals]] fight song and a MySpace tribute page in support of the Capitals 2008 Stanley Cup playoffs run. The song "1,000 Words to Say but One" was re-recorded with new lyrics and new solos into "Let's Go Caps!"<ref>expressnightout.com,[http://expressnightout.com/content/2008/04/playoff_anthem_darkest_hours_lets_go_cap.php "Playoff Anthem: Darkest Hour's 'Let's Go Caps!"]</ref><ref>Washington Capitals "Fight Song" Myspace, ["http://www.myspace.com/letsgocapsmusic"]</ref>
