|}'''MV ''Renfrew Rose''''' is a passenger ferry built in 1984. She operates the [[Renfrew Ferry]] between [[Renfrew]] and [[Yoker]], close to Glasgow City Centre. 

==History==
''Renfrew Rose'' was built in 1984 by MacCrindle Shipbuilding Ltd, [[Ardrossan]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.clydesite.co.uk/clydebuilt/viewship.asp?id=20917| title=Renfrew Rose| publisher=Clydesite| accessdate=14 March 2010}}</ref>

==Service==
Along with her sister ship, MV ''Yoker Swan'', ''Renfrew Rose'' is operated by [[Strathclyde Partnership for Transport]] (SPT) as the [[Renfrew Ferry]]. Crossing the [[River Clyde]] between the area of [[Yoker]] in Glasgow and the town of [[Renfrew]] in Renfrewshire, it is the last operational [[River Clyde|Clyde]] crossing this far upstream, and the closest to Glasgow City Centre. 

SPT announced on 22 January 2010 that the service will close at the end of March 2010. They voted to withdraw the service as part of moves to save <U+00A3>2.5m from their budget.<ref>{{cite news| title = Clyde ferry route to end in March| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8473322.stm| publisher = [[BBC News]]| date = 2010-01-22}}</ref> With the two vessels approaching the end of their working life, it was estimated that it would cost <U+00A3>2 million to replace them.<ref>{{cite news| title=Final Voyage for Renfrew Ferry| url=http://icrenfrewshire.icnetwork.co.uk/pde/news/tm_headline=final-voyage-for-renfrew-ferry&method=full&objectid=19888512&siteid=63858-name_page.html| publisher=[[Paisley Daily Express]]| date=2007-10-03}}</ref> Alternative services are being investigated.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.spt.co.uk/news/100312_ferry.aspx| title=SPT working hard to secure Ferry replacement| date=12 March 2010| publisher=[[Strathclyde Partnership for Transport]]| accessdate=12 March 2010}}</ref>

==Layout==
The ferry has a front ramp, which is accessed directly from the concrete slipways on both sides of the river. These give access to the front deck and an enclosed passenger cabin, which provides some shelter during the 2-minute crossing.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/renfrew/ferry/index.html| title=Renfrew to Yoker Ferry| publisher=Undiscovered Scotland| accessdate=14 March 2010}}</ref>
