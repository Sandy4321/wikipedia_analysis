{{nihongo|'''Akane Tsunemori'''|<U+5E38><U+5B88> <U+6731>|Tsunemori Akane}} is a fictional female character in the [[anime]] television series ''[[Psycho-Pass]]'', which was produced by [[Production I.G]]. Akane is a young adult who has just graduated from college; she is a new member of Unit One of the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division, which follows several crime investigations.  Akane befriends the unit's Enforcers and becomes involved in several crime scenes, which makes her question her views on society and causes her to become a strong detective. Akane has also appeared in [[manga]] and [[light novel|novel]] adaptations of the series. In the animated series, she is voiced by [[Kana Hanazawa]] in Japanese and by Kate Oxley in English.

Akane was created to be a relatable character who would question the setting and answer the viewer's questions. Early in the show's development, the production staff planned the way Akane would mature throughout the story. Early critical reception to Akane has been mixed. Some critics saw her as typical new cop often seen in dramas; others criticized her as uninteresting. However, her growth in the story earned praise for becoming a highly appealing protagonist.

==Creation and design==
<!--Some confusing text here, which I didn't unerstand enough to c/e properly. -->
Akane Tsunemori was created by the [[Production I.G]] staff to be the most relatable character in the series. She would question the setting from the audience's point of view and have it explained to them. She was written as the heroine, who would come between Shinya Kogami and Shogo Makishima and see their conflict from her own viewpoint. One of the staff's main objectives was Akane's growth.<ref name="jentonline">{{cite web |url=http://j-entonline.com/interviews-and-articles/media-qa-psycho-pass/|title=Media Q&A with Executive Director Katsuyuki Motohiro, Director Naoyoshi Shiotani and Producer Joji Wada (of "PSYCHO-PASS") by Dennis A.

Akane was designed by [[manga artist]] [[Akira Amano]].  The series is "anti-''[[Moe (slang)|moe]]''", so the production team decided to avoid having the Akane remove her clothes during episodes and instead had Kogami do it.<ref name="panel">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2013/sakura-con/5|title= Directors's Panel with Katsuyuki Motohiro, Naoyoshi Shiotani, and Atsuko Ishizuka|date=March 30, 2013|accessdate=December 30, 2013|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}</ref>Akane is voiced in the English-dubbed version by Kate Oxley.<ref name="engcast">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-12-21/funimation-reveals-psycho-pass-english-dub-cast-trailer|title=Funimation Reveals Psycho-Pass English Dub Cast, Trailer|publisher=Anime News Network|date=December 21, 2013|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}</ref>

==Reception==
Initial reactions to Akane were mixed. Hiroko Yamamura from Japanator liked the way the first episode focused on Akane's first day as a police officer and her opinions of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japanator.com/first-impressions-psycho-pass-27060.phtml|title=First Impressions: Psycho-Pass|publisher=Japanator|accessdate=March 21, 2014|date=October 16, 2012|author=Yamamura, Hiroko}}</ref> Thomas Zoth from The Fandom Post said Akane's personality is typical of those in dramas; he called her a "naive waif who gets over her head with her first case".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fandompost.com/2012/10/11/psycho-pass-episode-01-anime-review/|title=Psycho-Pass Episode #01 Anime Review |publisher=Fandom Post|accessdate=March 22, 2014|date=October 11, 2012 |author=Zoth, Tomas}}</ref> Zoth said that in later episodes, he liked the relationship Akane established with Masaoka and Ginoza, which resulted in several interesting scenes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fandompost.com/2013/01/22/psycho-pass-episode-13-anime-review/|title=Psycho-Pass Episode #13 Anime Review |publisher=Fandom Post|accessdate=March 22, 2014|date=January 22, 2014 |author=Zoth, Tomas}}</ref> Zoth said he grew to care about Akane during the first half of the series in "a somewhat ironically 'moe' way, as she's grown as a character".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fandompost.com/2012/12/21/psycho-pass-episode-10-11-anime-review/|title= Psycho-Pass Episode #10 <U+2013> 11 Anime Review |date=|accessdate= April 19, 2014}}</ref> In a similar review, Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network said Akane's actions in the first episode "[set] her up as the clear-eyed, albeit na<U+00EF>ve, outsider of the story, willing to look at things differently".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/psycho-pass/episodes-1|title=Psycho-Pass Episodes 1-11 Streaming|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=March 22, 2014|date=January 1, 2013 |author=Silverman, Rebbeca}}</ref> 

Bamboo Dong from [[Anime News Network]] was more critical of the character, calling her "a blank slate". She said Akane is "uninteresting and forgettable, and her previous role in the show as the moral compass seems to have waned as well".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-stream/2012-12-03#pp|title=The Stream Monsters in the Attic|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=March 22, 2014|date=December 3, 2012 |author=Dong, Bamboo}}</ref> Chris Beveridge from The Fandom Post was more optimistic; he said, "Akane provides a good voice for this, since she<U+2019>s new to it all and wants to bring nuance to the numbers and the situations, but we see how experience plays out against her at times, but also that she does have something to offer with it".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fandompost.com/2014/03/31/psycho-pass-the-complete-first-season-premium-blu-ray-box-set-anime-review/|title=Psycho-Pass: The Complete First Season Premium Blu-ray Box Set Anime Review |publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=March 31, 2014|date=March 31, 2014 |author=Beveridge, Chris}}</ref>

Despite mixed reactions to the character, her growth during the series earned praise. Silverman said that ever since her best friend's death at Shogo Makishima's hands, Akane underwent major character development as she "further distances herself from the bright-eyed rookie she began as, recognizing the flaws in the system while not being entirely certain that she can be the force for change in it". Silverman also praised the impact Akane brought to the climax and her relationship with Shinya Kogami.<ref name="annsecondreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/psycho-pass/episodes-12|title=Psycho-Pass episodes 12 - 22 Streaming|date=|accessdate= December 30, 2013}}</ref> In a later review, Dong said the character's uninteresting traits stop appearing in the second half of the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2014-03-31|title=Shelf Life The Other 1/2|date=March 31, 2014|accessdate=March 31, 2014|author=Dong, Bamboo}}</ref> 

Zoth said episode 20, in which "Akane finally snaps", was one of his most expected parts from the story.  Zoth also said, "Akane has grown as a character, and a detective, and in a bit of a heavy-handed move, she<U+2019>s shown transforming into Kogami in Ginoza's eyes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fandompost.com/2013/03/10/psycho-pass-episode-19-20-anime-review/|title=Psycho-Pass Episode #19 <U+2013> 20 Anime Review |date=March 10, 2013|author=Zoth, Thomas|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}</ref> Similarly, Bamboo Dong said, "No longer the dull and meek woman she was for over half the series, [Akane's]  now confident and capable, doling out commands that are instantly followed and respected by her comrades". Dong said Akane is an appealing main character who is "worth paying attention to, and her presence on screen is the perfect complement to the much more complex side characters that populate the show".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-stream/2013-03-25|title=The Stream These Girls Can Jump Rope Too, Can't They?!|publisher=Anime News Network|date=March 25, 2013|accessdate=March 22, 2014 |author=Dong, Bamboo}}</ref> Richard Eisenbeis from [[Kotaku]] said he found Akane more interesting than Kogami because her overall development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5991846/the-second-half-of-psycho-pass-isnt-perfect-but-its-still-worth-a-watch|title=The Second Half of Psycho Pass Isn't Perfect, But it's Still Worth a Watch|publisher=Kotaku|date=March 22, 2013|accessdate=March 22, 2014 |author=Eisenbeis, Richard}}</ref> Akane also won the "Miss Noitamina" award in an official poll involving characters that appeared in [[noitamina]] television series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2014-03-31/winners-of-noitamina-10th-anniversary-fan-vote-announced|title=Winners of Noitamina 10th Anniversary Fan Vote Announced|publisher=Anime News Network|date=March 31, 2013|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref> In the ''[[Newtype (magazine)|Newtype]]'' anime awards, Akane was voted the third-best female character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-10-13/attack-on-titan-wins-top-prizes-in-newtype-anime-awards|title=Attack on Titan Wins Top Prizes in Newtype Anime Awards|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref>
