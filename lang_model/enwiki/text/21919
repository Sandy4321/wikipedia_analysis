'''Boston College''' ('''BC''') is a private university located in the village of [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts|Chestnut Hill]], in the city of [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], [[Massachusetts]], in the [[New England]] region of the [[United States]]. Its historic campus, one of the earliest examples of [[Collegiate Gothic]] architecture in [[North America]], is set on a hilltop six&nbsp;miles (10&nbsp;km) west of downtown [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. Although [[charter]]ed as a [[university]] by the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] in 1863, Boston College's name reflects its early history as a [[liberal arts college]] and [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] in [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts|Boston's South End]]. It was the first institution of higher education established in Boston, though it later outgrew its original location and moved to [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts|Chestnut Hill]]. Boston College is one of the oldest [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] universities in the United States and is home to one of the largest Jesuit communities in the world.

==About Boston College==
[[Image:gassonsummer.jpg|left|thumb|[[Gasson Hall|Gasson Tower]] viewed from Linden Lane.]]Founded by the [[Society of Jesus]], Boston College opened its doors in 1863 to 22 students whose studies were concentrated within a [[liberal arts]] curriculum.<ref>[http://www.bc.edu/about/history.html History - Boston College]</ref> BC became the second [[Jesuit]] institution of higher learning in [[Massachusetts]] and the first located in the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] area. Its charter was among the first documents to stipulate that the institution "from its inception shall be open to youths of any faith," a policy since expanded to include those "of no religious faith at all."{{fact|date=August 2007}}

Boston College is called [[The Heights]], a reference to both its lofty aspirations <U+2014> the college motto is "[[Ever to Excel]]" <U+2014> and its elevated location on Chestnut Hill, or "University Heights" as the area was initially designated. The name has lent itself to a number of campus organizations <U+2014> including the principal student newspaper, ''[[The Heights (newspaper)|The Heights]]'' <U+2014> and to those affiliated with the university: BC students were universally called "Heightsmen" until 1925 when Mary C. Mellyn became the first "Heightswoman" to receive a BC degree. Today, [[List of Boston College people|the university's legacy]] includes over 143,000 alumni in over 120 countries around the world.<ref name=bc-facts>[http://www.bc.edu/about/bc-facts.html Boston College Facts - Boston College]</ref>

Boston College was added to the "25 New Ivies" list in 2006 by ''[[Kaplan, Inc.|Kaplan]]/[[Newsweek]]'', which includes "colleges whose first-rate academic programs, combined with a population boom in top students, have fueled their rise in stature and favor among the nation's top students, administrators and faculty -- edging them to a competitive status rivaling the [[Ivy League]]."<ref>{{cite news|title=25 New Ivies|date=2006-08-21|work=[[Kaplan, Inc.|Kaplan]]/[[Newsweek]]|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14325172/site/newsweek/}}</ref><!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:BCcoatofarms.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Boston College Coat of Arms]] from a stained glass window in the Gasson honors library.]] -->

Boston College students have enjoyed success in winning prestigious post-graduate fellowships and awards, including recent [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes]], [[Marshall scholarship|Marshall]], [[Mellon]], [[Fulbright Award|Fulbright]], [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]], [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]], and [[Barry Goldwater|Goldwater]] [[scholarship]]s, among others. BC's yield rate for Fulbright awardees is the highest in the country.<ref>{{cite news|title=News|work=Ohio University Outlook|date=2005-12-13|url=http://www.ohio.edu/outlook/05-06/December/191n-056.cfm|accessdate=2006-05-07}}</ref> In 2007, the [[German language|German]] department was awarded a record 13 Fulbright scholarships, five more than the previous number from a single department. Though formal numbers are not kept, the number of awardees from one department to study in a specific country is thought by academic scholars to be the largest in the 60-year history of the Fulbright program.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://media.www.bcheights.com/media/storage/paper144/news/2007/05/03/News/German.Dept.Sweeps.Fulbrights-2893246.shtml|work=[[The Heights (newspaper)|The Heights]]|date=2007-05-03|title=German Dept. Sweeps Fulbrights}}</ref>

At [[United States dollar|US$]]1.83 billion, BC's [[financial endowment|endowment]] is among the [[list of US colleges and universities by endowment|largest in American higher education]] and the largest of any Jesuit university in the world. Its annual operating budget is approximately $667 million.<ref name=endowment>{{cite news|url=http://media.www.bcheights.com/media/storage/paper144/news/2007/12/03/News/Bc.Unveils.1.6.Billion.Strategic.Plan-3132808.shtml|publisher=[[The Heights (newspaper)|The Heights]]|date=2007-12-03|title=BC unveils $1.6 billion strategic plan}}</ref>

[[AHANA]] is a term coined (and trademarked) by BC students in 1979 to refer to students of [[African-American]], [[Hispanic]], [[Asian people|Asian]], or [[Amerindians|Native American]] descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairfield.edu/x1876.xml|title=What is AHANA?|work=[[Fairfield University]] Student Life Multicultural Relations|accessdate=2006-05-07}}</ref> In 2006-07, AHANA students comprised 24% of BC undergraduates.<ref name=bc-facts /> International students make up an additional 5.3% of the student population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bc.edu/publications/factbook/meta-elements/pdf/05-06/05-06_internatl_students.pdf|title=International Students & Scholars By School, 2005-2006|accessdate=2006-08-14|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bc.edu/publications/factbook/meta-elements/pdf/05-06/05-06_enr_by_ft_and_pt.pdf|title=Enrollment, Fall 2005|accessdate=2006-08-14|format=PDF}}</ref>

In September 2006, the administration of Boston College unveiled the long-awaited campus overhaul project. Details of the project were featured in the newspaper, ''The Heights''. According to the paper, "BC's strategic vision will bring unprecedented structural development to campus."<ref name=campusplan>http://www.bcheights.com/news/2006/09/07/News/Campus.Plan.Debuts-2261199.shtml ''[[The Heights (newspaper)|The Heights]]'' September 7, 2006.</ref>

The paper also noted that the program would involve replacing the 800 beds in Edmond's Hall with 400-person residence halls on [[Shea Field]] and near Moore Hall, overlooking [[Commonwealth Avenue, Boston|Commonwealth Avenue]]. BC hopes to relocate the [[Boston College#McMullen Museum of Art|McMullen Museum of Art]] from Devlin Hall to a newly constructed building on the north side of Commonwealth Avenue, which will include additional open space in favor of a 1,000 to 1,200-person auditorium attached to it. Taking advantage of BC's location on Commonwealth Avenue, the designs will shift the MBTA station to the median in the center of the street. The school is also considering a [[skyway|sky bridge]] linking the new residence hall and museum. The baseball fields will be moved to the recently acquired [[St. John's Seminary (Massachusetts)|St. John's Seminary]] property in the [[Brighton, Boston, Massachusetts|Brighton]] section of Boston to free up additional open areas on the main campus. The Brighton property will also be home to new parking structures, tennis courts, an indoor track, and a conference center. More recent plans also call for the construction of student housing on the Brighton campus, a fact which has caused some controversy in the local neighborhoods.

Its most dramatic features, however, are a set of academic buildings that anchor a center for the humanities alongside the Dustbowl; a recasting of the Lower Campus as a polished center of intellectual and community life, including a new recreation complex and a University center; a set of science buildings in a quad built on the memories of Cushing and portions of Campion halls; a reef of performing arts facilities on the near edge of the Brighton Campus and an <U+201C>athletics and recreation district<U+201D> at the far end; and a knitting together of the Lower and Brighton campuses by means of a footbridge and several blocks of mixed-use development.<ref name=campusplan /><ref>"[http://bcm.bc.edu/issues/fall_2006/features/tomorrowland.html Tomorrowland]" ''[[Boston College Magazine]]''</ref> 

On the main campus, the first new building to go up will be named Stokes Commons, in honor of former board of trustees [[chairman]] [[Pat Stokes]], whose gift will fund the construction. The new building will replace McElroy as central point of student life and will include dining facilities, meeting space, practice space, and offices. Stokes Commons will be located adjacent to Lyons Hall. It is expected that construction may begin as early as 2009, with the building currently under design.

==Light the World campaign==
On October 11, 2008, Boston College officially launched its ''Light the World'' campaign. The $1.5 billion, 7 year campaign in honor of the 150th anniversary of the college, represents the largest campaign in the school's history, far surpassing the $440 million raised during the last ''Ever to Excel'' campaign. In addition to an ambitious dollar goal, the campaign hopes to achieve three other goals. These include:
*To double the number of alumni engaged in significant volunteer roles for the University.
*To increase the number of undergraduate alumni donors who make a gift to Boston College every year.
*To secure 5,000 [[estate]] commitments to Boston College.
Funds raised will be used to support the strategic priorities of the University, including academic programs, financial aid, Jesuit Catholic identity, athletics, student programming, and capital construction projects.<ref>''[[Boston College Chronicle]]'', November 4, 2008.</ref>

==Rankings and admissions==
Admission to Boston College is among the most selective in the United States. For the class of 2012, BC received a record 31,000 applications from prospective undergraduates, admitting 26%, making it the most selective class in the school's history. BC ranks fifth (after [[New York University|NYU]], [[University of Southern California|USC]], [[Boston University|BU]], and [[Northeastern University|Northeastern]]) among private American universities in the number of applications it receives annually, though it is less than half the size of the four schools that rank above it. The middle half of the class of 2012 had test scores that ranged from 1950-2220 on the [[Standardized Aptitude Test|SAT]] and 30-33 on the [[ACT (examination)|ACT]].<ref>[http://www.bc.edu/admission/undergrad/process/selecting.html Selecting the Class - Boston College<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

BC placed 11th in a ranking of national universities (published in ''[[Forbes Magazine]]'') by the [[Center for College Affordability & Productivity]], a research group in [[Washington, D.C.]].<ref>{{cite news|title=How to Choose a College|date=2008-05-19|work=[[Forbes.com]]|url=http://www.forbes.com/opinions/forbes/2008/0519/030_2.html}}</ref>

The undergraduate school of business, the [[Carroll School of Management]], placed 14th in an annual survey of US undergraduate business schools by ''[[BusinessWeek]]'', which noted that "Alumni and professors love helping students find jobs, making BC's campus networking an invaluable resource."<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/07/undergrad/index.html Undergraduate B-School Profiles<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
BC ranked 34th among national universities in ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'''s "America's Best Colleges 2009" rankings.<ref>{{cite news|title=America's Best Colleges 2009|date=2008-03-26|work=[[U.S. News and World Report]]|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/t1natudoc_brief.php}}</ref>

A study by [[Carnegie Communications]] in 2004 ranked BC 17th among national universities.<ref>[http://www.carnegiecomm.com/resources/pcform.html "Project Connect"] [[Carnegie Communications]]</ref> The same study cited BC as the 8th "most popular" choice among U.S. high school seniors.<ref>{{cite news|title='Project Connect' results|date=2004-03-04|work=Boston College Chronicle|url=http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/rvp/pubaf/chronicle/v12/mr4/numbers.html}}</ref>

A [[Princeton Review]] survey of parents that asked <U+201C>What <U+2018>dream college<U+2019> would you most like to see your child attend were prospects of acceptance or cost not issues?<U+201D> placed BC 6th.<ref>http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/rvp/pubaf/07/DreamCollege07.pdf</ref>

In 2008 ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' ranked the full time BC MBA program 34th in the nation, and the evening MBA program climbed to 15th, the 5th year it has been in the top 20 nationwide.

==History==

[[Image:OldBClithograph.jpg|thumb|left|Old BC in [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts|Boston's South End]]]][[Image:johnmcelroy.jpg|thumb|right|[[John McElroy, SJ]]]]
===Early history===
The history of Boston College is traced to the founding of the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1534 and the early activity of Jesuits in New England in the 17th and 18th centuries. Jesuit founder, [[St. Ignatius of Loyola]], imagined a distinct mission that sought to engage intellectual inquiry, faith, and cultural contributions "in conversation with the city." His Society established colleges and universities in almost every part of the known world, and its members were among the great explorers of the [[Age of Discovery]]. In 1825, [[Benedict Joseph Fenwick]], [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]], a Jesuit from [[Maryland]], became the second [[Bishop]] of Boston. He was the first to articulate a vision for a "College in the City of Boston" that would raise a new generation of leaders to serve both the civic and spiritual needs of his fledgling diocese.

===''A College in the City''===
In 1827, Bishop Fenwick opened a school in the basement of his [[cathedral]] and took to the personal instruction of the city's youth. His efforts to attract other Jesuits to the faculty were hampered both by Boston's distance from the center of Jesuit activity in Maryland and by suspicion on the part of the city's [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|Protestant elite]]. Relations with Boston's civic leaders worsened such that, when a Jesuit faculty was finally secured in 1843, Fenwick decided to leave the Boston school and instead opened the [[College of the Holy Cross]] {{convert|45|mi|km}} west of the city in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] where he felt the Jesuits could operate with greater autonomy. Meanwhile, the vision for a college in Boston was sustained by [[John McElroy, S.J.]], who saw an even greater need for such an institution in light of Boston's growing immigrant population. With the approval of his Jesuit superiors, McElroy went about raising funds and in 1857 purchased land for "The Boston College" on Harrison Street in [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts|Boston's South End]]. With little fanfare, the college's two buildings <U+2014> a schoolhouse and a [[church]] <U+2014> welcomed their first class of scholastics in 1859. Two years later, with as little fanfare, BC closed again. Its short-lived second incarnation was plagued by the outbreak of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and disagreement within the Society over the college's governance and finances. BC's inability to obtain a charter from the anti-Catholic Massachusetts legislature only compounded its troubles.

On {{start date|1863|3|31}}, more than three decades after its initial inception, Boston College's charter was formally approved by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In it, BC was granted the right to confer all university degrees, with the exception of the [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] (a limitation that was later amended).{{fact|date=February 2007}} [[Johannes Bapst]], S.J., a Swiss Jesuit from French-speaking [[Fribourg]], was selected as BC's first president and immediately reopened the original college buildings on Harrison Avenue. For most of the 19th century, BC offered a singular 7-year program corresponding to both high school and college. Its entering class in the fall of 1864 included 22 students, ranging in age from 11 to 16 years. The curriculum was based on the Jesuit ''[[Ratio Studiorum]]'', emphasizing [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[philosophy]], and [[theology]]. Revolutionary for its time, BC's charter emphasized that "the profession of religion will not be a condition for admission to the College."{{fact|date=February 2007}}[[Image:margaretursulamagrath.jpg|right|thumb|Margaret Ursula Magrath '26]]

[[Image:Ratiostudiorum.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Ratio Studiorum]]'']]

===The move to Chestnut Hill===
Boston College's enrollment reached nearly 500 by the turn of the 20th century. Expansion of the South End buildings onto James Street enabled increased separation between the high school and college divisions, though [[Boston College High School]] remained a constituent part of Boston College until 1927 when it was separately [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]]. In 1907, newly-installed President [[Thomas I. Gasson]], S.J., determined that BC's cramped, urban quarters in Boston's South End were inadequate and unsuited for significant expansion. Inspired by [[John Winthrop]]'s early vision of Boston as a "[[city upon a hill]]," he re-imagined Boston College as world-renowned university and a beacon of [[Jesuit]] scholarship. Less than a year after taking office, he purchased [[Amos Adams Lawrence]]'s farm on [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts|Chestnut Hill]], six&nbsp;miles (10&nbsp;km) west of the city. He organized an international competition for the design of a [[campus]] master plan and set about raising funds for the construction of the "new" university. Proposals were solicited from distinguished architects, and [[Charles Donagh Maginnis]]' ambitious proposal for twenty buildings in English Collegiate Gothic style, called "Oxford in America", was selected.

By 1913, construction costs had surpassed available funds, and as a result [[Gasson Hall]], "New BC's" main building, stood alone on Chestnut Hill for its first three years. Buildings of the former Lawrence farm, including a barn and gatehouse, were temporarily adapted for college use while a massive fundraising effort was underway. While Maginnis' ambitious plans were never fully realized, BC's first "capital campaign" <U+2014> which included a large replica of Gasson Hall's clock tower set up on Boston Common to measure the fundraising progress <U+2014> ensured that President Gasson's vision survived. By the 1920s BC began to fill out the dimensions of its university charter, establishing the [[Boston College Graduate School of Arts & Sciences]], the [[Boston College Law School]], and the [[Woods College of Advancing Studies]], followed successively by the [[Boston College Graduate School of Social Work]], the [[Carroll School of Management]], the [[Connell School of Nursing]], and the [[Lynch School of Education]]. In 1926, Boston College conferred its first degrees on women (though it did not become fully coeducational until 1970). With the rising prominence of its graduates, this was also the period in which Boston College and its powerful Alumni Association began to establish themselves among the city's leading institutions. At the city, state and federal levels, BC graduates would come to dominate Massachusetts politics for much of the 20th century.

Cultural changes in American society and in the church following the [[Second Vatican Council]] forced BC to question its purpose and mission. Meanwhile, poor financial management lead to deteriorating facilities and resources and rising tuition costs. Student outrage, combined with growing protests over [[Vietnam]] and the bombings in [[Cambodia]], culminated in student strikes, including demonstrations at [[Gasson Hall]] in April 1970.[[Image:Frmonan.jpg|left|thumb|[[J. Donald Monan]], [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]]]]

===The Monan era===
By the time [[J. Donald Monan]], S.J. assumed the presidency on September 5, 1972, BC was approximately $30 million in debt, its endowment totaled just under $6 million, and faculty and staff salaries had been frozen during the previous year. Rumors about the university's future were rampant, including speculation that BC would be acquired by [[Harvard University]]. Monan's first order of business was to reconfigure the Boston College Board of Trustees. By separating it from the [[Society of Jesus]], Monan was able to bring in the talents of lay alumni and business leaders who helped turn around the university's fortunes. This same restructuring had been accomplished first at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1967 by Fr. [[Theodore Hesburgh]], [[Congregation of the Holy Cross|CSC]] with many other Catholic colleges following suit in the ensuing years. In 1974, Boston College acquired [[Newton College of the Sacred Heart]], a {{convert|40|acre|m2|sing=on}} campus {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} away that enabled it to expand the law school and provide more housing for a student population that was increasingly residential and geographically diverse. No less than the university's rescue is credited to Monan who set into motion the university's upward trajectory in finances, reputation, and global scope. In 1996, Monan's 24 year presidency, the longest in the university's history, came to an end when he was named [[Chancellor (education)|University Chancellor]] and succeeded by President [[William P. Leahy]], S.J..[[Image:BCmemoriallabyrinth.jpg|left|thumb|[[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] [[September 11, 2001 attack memorials and services|Memorial]] [[Labyrinth]]]]

===Recent history===
Since assuming the Boston College presidency, Leahy's tenure has been marked with an acceleration of the growth and development initiated by his predecessor. BC's endowment has grown to $1.83 billion,<ref name=endowment /> it has expanded by almost {{convert|150|acres|m2}}, and undergraduate applications have surpassed 31,000. At the same time, BC students, faculty and athletic teams have seen unprecedented success <U+2014> winning record numbers of [[Fulbright Award|Fulbrights]], [[Rhodes scholarship|Rhodes]], and other academic awards; setting new marks for research grants; and winning conference and national titles. In 2002, Leahy initiated the [[Church in the 21st Century]] program to examine issues facing the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] in light of the [[Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal|clergy sexual abuse scandal]]. His effort brought BC worldwide praise and recognition for "leading the way on Church reform."<ref>{{cite news|first=Scot|last=Lehigh|title=BC is leading the way on church reform|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=2002-06-19|url=http://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/stories2/061902_lehigh.htm}}</ref>

Recent plans to merge with the [[Weston Jesuit School of Theology]] were followed by an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' claiming "such a merger would further Boston College's quest to become the nation's Catholic intellectual powerhouse" and that, once approved by the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]] and Jesuit authorities in [[Rome]], BC "would become ''the'' center for the study of Roman Catholic theology in the United States."<ref>{{cite news|first=David|last=Gibson|title=Jesuits Show Strength, Even as Their Numbers Shrink|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2004-12-12|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10F16FB35550C718DDDAB0994DC404482}}</ref> On February 16, 2006, the merger was authorized by the [[Jesuit Conference]].<ref>http://www.wjst.edu/File/BC_Weston_Press_Release.pdf</ref>

In 2003, after years of student-led discussions and efforts, the University approved a Gay-Straight Alliance, the first University-funded gay support group on campus. In 2004, between 1,000 and 1,200 students rallied behind a student-led campaign to expand the school's non-discrimination statement to include equal protection for gays and lesbians.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jennifer|last=Russell|title=1,000 rally for gay rights at college|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=2005-04-16|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/04/16/1000_rally_for_gay_rights_at_college/}}</ref> Earlier that year 84% of the student body voted in favor of a student referendum calling for a change in policy.<ref>{{cite news|first=Alexis|last=Mark|title=Support shown for referendum|work=[[The Heights (newspaper)|The Heights]]|date=2005-03-03|url=http://www.bcheights.com/media/storage/paper144/news/2005/03/03/News/Support.Shown.For.Referendum-884268.shtml?norewrite200610020930&sourcedomain=www.bcheights.com}}</ref> After several months of discussion the university's policy was changed in May 2005.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jenna|last=Russell|title=Boston College set to adopt language that welcomes gays|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=2005-05-10|url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2005/05/10/boston_college_set_to_adopt_language_that_welcomes_gays/}}</ref>

On December 5, 2007, Boston College announced the Master Plan, a $1.6 billion, 10-year plan to revamp the campus and hire new faculty. The plan includes over $700 million for new buildings and renovations of the campus, including construction of four new academic buildings, a {{convert|200000|ft2|m2|abbr=on}} recreation center to replace the outdated Flynn Recreation Complex, a {{convert|285000|ft2|m2|abbr=on}} university center to replace McElroy Commons (which is slated for destruction), and the creation of 610 beds for student housing, as well as many other constructions and renovations.<ref>http://www.vhb.com/bostoncollege/imp/pdf/masterplan07.pdf</ref> Father Leahy said, "We are announcing our Strategic and Master Plans with the goal of creating the finest campus facilities for our students and faculty, while also committing ourselves to becoming a national leader in liberal arts education and student formation, and the world<U+2019>s leading Catholic university and theological center."<ref>http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/rvp/pubaf/07/ChronicleSupplementDec07.pdf</ref>

The plan has been criticized by Boston city officials. On February 21, 2008, [[Mayor of Boston|Boston Mayor]] [[Thomas M. Menino]] warned the school to construct new dormitory building on its main campus, rather than on the former [[St. John's Seminary (Massachusetts)|St. John's Seminary]] property acquired from the [[Archdiocese of Boston]]. Student misbehavior in the neighborhoods around the school has been a problem for area residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2008/02/22/city_tells_bc_to_revise_its_plan/|title=Hub urges BC not to build dorms on former property of diocese|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=2008-02-22}}</ref><ref>http://www.pbs.org/weta/washingtonweek/voices/200111/1112homecoming.html</ref><ref>http://www.ilfilosofo.com/blog/2005/10/26/bawdy-boston-college-students-bother-brighton/</ref>

God is thy Master, His law thy sole avail!<br>
Hail! Alma Mater! Hail! All Hail![[Image:BCgassonquadaerial.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gasson Hall|Gasson]] Quadrangle]]

===''For Boston''===
{{main|For Boston}}
"For Boston" is America's oldest college [[fight song]].{{fact|date=December 2008}} It has two verses but the most commonly sung one is the first verse. Boston-based band [[Dropkick Murphys]] covered this song on their album ''[[Sing Loud, Sing Proud!]]''.

For Boston, for Boston,<br>
We sing our proud refrain!<br>
For Boston, for Boston,<br>
'Tis Wisdom's earthly fane.<br>
For here all are one<br>
And their hearts are true,<br>
And the towers on the Heights<br>
Reach to Heav'ns own blue.<br>
For Boston, for Boston,<br>
Till the echoes ring again!

For Boston, for Boston,<br>
Thy glory is our own!<br>
For Boston, for Boston,<br>
'Tis here that Truth is known.<br>
And ever with the Right<br>
Shall thy heirs be found,<br>
Till time shall be no more<br>
And thy work is crown'd.<br>
For Boston, for Boston,<br>
For Thee and Thine alone.

==The campus==
===Landscape and architecture===
Set on a hilltop overlooking the [[Chestnut Hill Reservoir]] and the distant Boston skyline ([http://at.bc.edu/webcams/bostonskyline/ see live webcam]), Boston College's {{convert|175|acre|m2|sing=on}} Chestnut Hill campus includes over 120 buildings in addition to athletic fields, rolling hills, wooded areas, three formal gardens, an orchard, and over 100 species of trees.{{fact|date=December 2007}} The campus creates an almost rural setting, only {{convert|6|mi|km}} west of downtown Boston. A "[[Boston College (MBTA station)|Boston College]]" "T"-station, located at St. Ignatius Gate, is the western terminus of the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA) [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]]'s [[Green Line "B" Branch|B-branch]] (also known as the "Boston College" line) and provides transit to the [[city center]]. Travel time is approximately 30 to 45 minutes. Travel time to Boston can be reduced by taking a shuttle bus to the "[[Reservoir (MBTA station)|Reservoir]]" station and riding the faster [[Green Line "D" Branch|D line]] into the city. 

Due largely to its location and architecture, the Boston College campus is known affectionately as the "Heights", the "Crowned Hilltop".<ref>[http://www.bc.edu/about/bc-facts/s-bc-facts.html Gothic Design - Boston College<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The [[Boston College Main Campus Historic District|main campus]] is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name="nris">{{cite web|url=http://www.nr.nps.gov/|title=National Register Information System|date=2007-01-23|work=[[National Register of Historic Places]]|publisher=[[National Park Service]]}} Reference#: 90000109</ref><gallery>

===''The Crowned Hilltop''===
Designed by [[Charles Donagh Maginnis]] and his firm [[Maginnis & Walsh]] in 1908, the Boston College campus is a seminal example of [[Collegiate Gothic]] architecture. Publication of its design in 1909 <U+2014> and praise from influential American [[Gothicist]] [[Ralph Adams Cram]] <U+2014> helped establish Collegiate Gothic as the prevailing architectural style on American university campuses for much of the 20th Century. Combining [[Gothic Revival]] architecture with principles of [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] planning, Maginnis proposed a vast complex of academic buildings set in a [[cruciform]] plan. The design suggested an enormous outdoor [[cathedral]], with a long entry drive at the "[[nave]]," the main [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] at the "[[apse]]" and secondary quadrangles at the "[[transept]]s". At the "[[crossing]]," Maginnis placed the university's main building, which he called "Recitation Hall". Using stone quarried on the site, the building was constructed at the highest point on Chestnut Hill, commanding a view of the surrounding landscape and the city to the east. Dominated by a soaring {{convert|200|ft|m|sing=on}} bell tower, Recitation Hall was known simply as the "Tower Building" when it finally opened in 1913. Maginnis' design broke from the traditional [[Oxbridge]] models that had inspired it <U+2014> and that had till then characterized Gothic architecture on American campuses. In its unprecedented scale, [[Gasson Hall|Gasson Tower]] was conceived not as the [[belfry]] of a singular building, but as the crowning [[campanile]] of Maginnis' new "[[city upon a hill]]".<gallery>

===Expansion and eclecticism===
Though Maginnis' ambitious Gothic project never saw full completion, its central portion was built according to plan and forms the core of what is now BC's iconic middle campus. Among these, the Bapst Library has been called the "finest example of Collegiate Gothic architecture in America" and [[Devlin Hall]] won the [[Harleston Parker Medal]] for "most beautiful building in Boston". Subsequent campus expansions exceeded even President Gasson's vision and brought with them a new set of architectural vocabulary: [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]], [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]], [[Richardsonian]] [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], and others.{{fact|date=December 2008}} The 1895 [[Louis K. Liggett]] Estate was acquired in 1941 and developed into a [[Tudor style]] upper campus, while an architecturally eclectic lower campus took shape on land acquired by filling in part of the [[Chestnut Hill Reservoir]]. Around this time, a Seattle newspaper ranked Boston College second in a list of "America's Most Beautiful Campuses" (the [[University of Washington]] ranked first).{{fact|date=February 2007}} Notions of "beauty" meanwhile were challenged by the advent of [[modernism]]. The 1940 design for St. Ignatius Church is an important hybrid of this period and is an example of what has been called "Modern Gothic". Modernism had an enormous impact on development after the 1940s, though most modernist buildings at BC maintained decidedly un-modern rough stone facades in keeping with Maginnis' original designs. By the 1960s, BC's severe space demands and poor financial health began to leave their mark, as evidenced by the construction of prefabricated modular apartments on the lower campus. Originally intended as temporary housing, the "Mods" have survived in large part because of their popularity among upperclassmen. Other legacies of this era include the [[hyperbolic]]-roofed Flynn Recreation Complex, constructed using laminated wood beams, and the later [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] [[O'Neill Library]], designed by [[The Architects Collaborative]]. More recent campus development signals a return to Maginnis & Walsh's Collegiate Gothic designs, as reflected in the renovations of [[Fulton Hall]] (1997) and [[Higgins Hall]] (2002), and in the construction of Campanella Hall (2003) and the St. Ignatius Gate Residence Hall (2004). Campenella houses a small bookstore, the Hillside Cafe, the Undergraduate Government of Boston College (UGBC), and the Theology, History, Philosophy, Computer Science, and Economics departments. The building is connected via a causeway to Middle Campus through the O'Neill Library entrance. The Hillside Cafe operates a food-service [[Starbucks]]; meaning that it is not company owned, operated, or branded but students can still enjoy Starbucks beverages.{{fact|date=March 2007}}[[Image:Cardinalsmansion.jpg|thumb|left|The Former "Cardinal's Mansion"]]

In June 2004, Boston College acquired {{convert|43|acres|m2}} of land from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston|Archdiocese of Boston]].<ref>http://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/stories5/042104_sale.htm ''[[The Boston Globe]]''</ref><ref>http://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/stories5/042104_statement.htm ''[[The Boston Globe]]''</ref> The new grounds, adjacent to the main campus (on the opposite side of [[Commonwealth Avenue, Boston|Commonwealth Avenue]]), include the historic mansion that served as the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]'s residence until 2002. The new grounds are referred to as Brighton Campus, after [[Brighton, Boston, Massachusetts|Brighton]], the area in Boston where it is located.

===Other properties===
In addition to the main campus at Chestnut Hill, BC's {{convert|40|acre|m2|sing=on}} Newton Campus is located {{convert|1|mi|km|sing=on}} to the west and houses the law school and residential housing for roughly one third of the freshman class. Other BC properties include a {{convert|20|acre|m2|sing=on}} seismology research observatory and field station in [[Weston, Massachusetts]], an {{convert|80|acre|m2|sing=on}} retreat center in [[Dover, Massachusetts]], and the [[Centre for Irish Programmes: Dublin]] on [[St. Stephen's Green]] in [[Dublin, Ireland|Dublin]], [[Ireland]].[[Image:KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg|right|thumb|[[Book of Kells]] facsimile, Burns Library]]

===Libraries & museums===
Boston College's eight research libraries contain over two million printed volumes. Including manuscripts, journals, government documents and microform items, ranging from ancient papyrus scrolls to digital databases, the collections have some twelve million items. Together with the university's museums, they include original manuscripts and prints by [[Galileo]], [[Ignatius of Loyola]], and [[Francis Xavier]] as well as world renowned collections in [[Jesuit]]ana, [[Ireland|Irish]] literature, sixteenth century [[Flanders|Flemish]] tapestries, ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] pottery, [[Caribbean]] folk art and literature, [[Japanese art|Japanese prints]], [[United States federal government|U.S. government]] documents, [[United States Congress|Congressional]] Archives, and paintings that span the history of art from [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[the Americas]].

====O'Neill Library====
BC's central research library, the [[Tip O'Neill|Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr.]] Library is named for the former [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives]], a member of the Boston College Class of 1936. Opened in 1984, it houses approximately two million volumes in the [[humanities]], the natural sciences and the social sciences.{{fact|date=December 2008}} It also contains U.S. government documents, administrative offices of the Boston College Libraries, and a museum dedicated to "Tip" O'Neill on the second floor, whose papers are housed in the [[Boston College#Burns Library|Burns Library]]. A glass-enclosed [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] on the library's fourth and fifth floors offers sweeping views of the Boston skyline. The CTRC, Computer Technology Research Center (formerly SLSC, the Student Learning and Support Center), the largest computer lab on campus, and the Connors Family Learning Center (formerly ADC, the Academic Development Center), the student tutoring area, are located on the second floor.[[Image:Garganhall.jpg|right|thumb|Gargan Hall, Bapst Library]][[Image:Bapst Library 3 Lamb.jpg|left|thumb|An entrance to the Bapst Library]]

====Bapst Library====
Opened in 1928, Bapst Library was named for the first president of Boston College ([[Johannes Bapst]], S.J., 1815 to 1887) and it was one of the few structures built according to Charles Donagh Maginnis' original "Oxford in America" master plan. Bapst served as the university's main library until 1984. It has been widely praised as the "finest example of Collegiate Gothic architecture in America." In 1987, it reopened after a two-year, multimillion dollar restoration and now houses the university's [[fine arts]] collection. Designed as a "cathedral to learning," it is the most elaborate of the original Collegiate Gothic buildings on campus with extensive stained glass windows, vaulted ceilings and carved wood paneling. Gargan Hall, the soaring reading room on the library's upper floor, has been named the most beautiful room in Boston. Also on the upper floor are the [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]]'s office and the [[Lonergan Institute]]. The reading room on the ground floor features a gold-leaf and wood-beamed ceiling that was carefully restored with funds from the [[Kresge Foundation]]. A guide to the building's famous stained glass windows is available online.<ref>http://www.bc.edu/publications/atbc/features/innerfire/slideshow/01.html ''@BC''</ref>[[Image:Burnsmemorial.jpg|thumb|left|Ford Memorial Tower, Burns Library]]

====Burns Library====
[[Image:Burnslibrarythompsonroom.jpg|right|thumb|Thompson Room, Burns Library]]
The [[Burns Library of Rare Books and Special Collections]] is home to more than 150,000 volumes, some 15 million manuscripts and other important works, including a world-renowned collection of Irish literature. A rare facsimile of the [[Book of Kells]] is on public display in the library's Irish Room, and each day one page of the [[illuminated manuscript]] is turned. Other significant holdings include original works by [[Sir Isaac Newton]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Graham Greene]], [[Seamus Heaney]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], [[James Joyce]], [[Francis Thompson]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], and [[William Butler Yeats]], among others. It also houses the papers of prominent Boston College [[list of Boston College people|alumni]], including [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] [[Speaker of the House|Speaker]] [[Tip O'Neill|Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill, Jr.]]; legal scholar and former [[United States Congress|U.S. Congressman]] [[Robert Drinan|Robert F. Drinan, S.J.]]; US Representative [[Edward P. Boland]]; and [[Margaret Heckler]], Congresswoman, [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services]], and [[United States Ambassador to Ireland|U.S. Ambassador to Ireland]]. The library is named after the Honorable [[John. J. Burns]] (1901 to 1957), Massachusetts Superior Court Justice and a member of the Boston College Class of 1921. The library's lofty Ford Memorial Tower is considerably more elaborate than [[Gasson Hall|Gasson Tower]], though not as tall. Inside, the Thompson Room features a magnificent [[oriel window]] depicting epic poetry, while the Trustee Room includes stained glass depictions of 54 Jesuit [[coat-of-arms|armorial crests]]. Exhibits are held frequently on the library's main level and guided tours are available on request.

====Law Library====
In a new building opened in 1996, the Law Library is located on the [[Boston College Law School]] campus in [[Newton, Massachusetts]] and contains approximately 500,000 volumes covering all major areas of American law and primary legal materials from the federal government, [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United Nations]], and the [[European Union]]. The library also features a substantial treatise and periodical collection and a growing collection of international and comparative law material. The library's [[Coquillette Rare Book Room]] houses works from the 15th through 19th centuries, including works by and about [[Thomas More|Saint Thomas More]].

====McMullen Museum of Art====
Located in [[Devlin Hall]], the [[McMullen Museum of Art]] houses a prominent permanent collection and organizes exhibits from all periods and cultures of [[art history]]. Recent exhibits and acquisitions, including works by [[Edvard Munch]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Fran<U+00E7>oise Gilot]], [[John LaFarge]], and [[Jackson Pollock]] have widened both the scope of the collection and its audience. ''Saints and Sinners,'' a 1999 exhibition on the work of [[Caravaggio]], attracted the largest audience of any university museum up to that time. Related museum activities include musical and theatrical performances, films, gallery talks, symposia, lectures, readings, and receptions that draw students, faculty, alumni and visitors from around the world. Admission to the Museum is free and open to the general public.

====Education Resource Center====
Located in Campion Hall, the [[Education Resource Center]] (ERC) houses a prominent permanent collection of education materials for the next generation of teachers. The ERC is the special library devoted to the [[Lynch School of Education]] and one of the few libraries at BC to have its own cataloguing department. Recent renovations include a new technology room with state of the art equipment, such as [[SMARTboard]] and plasma television, to prepare students for their roles as teachers. Related museum activities include its own classroom, viewing areas, and computer lab with [[Macintosh|Macs]] and [[Windows PC|PCs]]. Like all BC libraries the ERC is a member of the [[Boston Consortium]] but its materials are only for the BC community.

====Newton Resource Center====
The [[Newton Resource Center]] (NRC) is an undergraduate resource library situated in the center of Boston College<U+2019>s satellite Newton Campus accessible through Trinity Chapel. A converted theater, it is nicknamed "the [[morgue]]" both because of its absolute silence and its location in the former [[crypt]] beneath the chapel.{{fact|date=November 2008}} As of the fall of 2006, the NRC is closed to student access, though the NRC continues to house a large portion of O<U+2019>Neill<U+2019>s overflow books, journals, and periodicals. Although there were problems with mold and water in the NRC, extensive work has been done to rectify these issues. Currently there are books being stored there, which can be requested through the O'Neill Library.

====Kenny-Cottle Library====
The Kenny-Cottle Library is located on south side of the Newton Campus. At present, the building is being refitted to be used as office space, but the core of the building remains a closed-to-the-public overflow archive for the O<U+2019>Neill library, housing more than 200,000 volumes available for request through the main library system.

====Other libraries & museums====
Other BC libraries include dedicated facilities for the schools social work and education, and a geophysics library at the [[Weston Observatory]]. Additional exhibition spaces include a student art gallery on the Bapst Library's mezzanine level as well as exhibition space in the [[Robsham Theater]] and Campanella Hall. Items related to BC history and athletics are on display at the Hall of Fame in [[Conte Forum]] and the [[Boston College Football Museum|BC Football Museum]] in the [[Yawkey Athletics Center]].

==Alliances==
===Saint Ignatius===
The unofficial [[chapel]] for the university is the [[Church of Saint Ignatius of Loyola]].<ref>[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/prs/stign/ The Parish of St. Ignatius of Loyola<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The church is named after [[Saint Ignatius of Loyola]], the founder of the Jesuit [[Catholic order|order]]. Although not technically the university's church, St. Ignatius enjoys a special relationship with Boston College through which the university provides the parish with Internet access, e-mail service, telephone and [[voice mail]] service, parking, and dormitory space for the [[Religious Education|religious education]] program. Each year, several Boston College students teach in the religious education program. Jesuits priests from Boston College occasionally preside at the church's liturgies. On their part, St. Ignatius provides a spiritual home for many students during their time at Boston College and for many alumni on their [[wedding]] day. The church building is also used by the college for some of their larger events.

===Saint Columbkille's===
St. Columbkille's is a [[Roman Catholic Church]] and [[elementary school]] in [[Brighton, Boston, Massachusetts|Brighton]], [[Massachusetts]] which has made an alliance with BC. Under the agreement, the school (founded in 1901) is to be governed by a [[board of members]] and a [[board of trustees]] comprising representatives from [[Archdiocese of Boston|the Archdiocese of Boston]], Boston College, [[Saint Columbkille|St. Columbkille]] [[Parish]] and the [[greater Boston]] community. The board of trustees will authorize an audit of the school's curriculum, faculty, finances, and facilities before creating a strategic plan to guide the school in the future. [[Lynch School of Education]] faculty will work directly with the school's teachers on faculty and curriculum development, presenting new approaches to education and working to establish best practices in the classroom.<ref>http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/rvp/pubaf/chronicle/v14/mr30/partnership.html ''[[Boston College Chronicle]]''</ref>

The agreement, announced in March 2006 by University President William P. Leahy, S.J., and Boston Cardinal [[Sean O'Malley]], [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|OFM, Cap.]], represents the first such collaboration between a Catholic university and a [[parochial school]] in the [[United States]].

Since its inception [[St. Columbkille School]] has had a strong relationship with Boston College, with thousands of its graduates and [[parishioner]]s having attended the University. Over the years, the Lynch School has been actively involved in St. Columbkille through its Extended Services Program, which offers [[after-school]] and summer programs for children and families focused on learning and healthy development, and its [[The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Foundation]]-sponsored "Teachers for a New Era" program, which provides [[professional development]] and teacher training at the school.

In addition, Boston College students [[tutor]] at the school on a weekly basis and teach [[confirmation]] classes throughout the school year. BC employees also volunteer in the Read Aloud Program at St. Columbkille, reading to [[kindergarten]], [[first grade|first]], and [[second grade]] pupils during their lunch breaks.[[Image:Boson College sign.jpg|right|thumb|The St. Ignatius Gate entrance]]

==Jesuit-Catholic tradition==
[[Image:Goldeneagle.jpg|right|thumb|The gilded bronze eagle on Linden Lane. The statue once stood in front of U.S. Ambassador [[Larz Anderson]]'s residence in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]].<ref>Donovan, Charles F.. "History of Boston College: From the Beginnings to 1990"; University Press of Boston College, September 1990, p.266</ref>]]BC's Jesuit-Catholic identity is rooted in the distinct vision of [[Ignatius of Loyola]], the founder of the Jesuit order, who believed in "finding God in all things." Jesuits are characterized by a dedication to both "the life of the mind and the encounter with the world," a mission distinguished by their intellectual and humanitarian activities &mdash; notably in the fields of higher education, human rights, and social justice. As explorers, scientists, artists, diplomats, and writers, Jesuits have historically been at the forefront of scientific discovery and cultural expression. As a result, they have had a sometimes tumultuous relationship with the Catholic Church <U+2014> and were officially [[Suppression of the Jesuits|suppressed]] by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] from 1773 to 1814 <U+2014> though their work has always been dedicated ''Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam'', or "to the greater glory of God." The 112 Jesuits living on the Boston College campus make up one of the largest Jesuit communities in the world and include members of the faculty and administration, graduate students and visiting international scholars.<ref name=disamBCM>Voosen, Paul.

[[File:ADMG.jpg|left|thumb|An entrance featuring the [[Jesuit]] [[motto]] ''[[Ad maiorem Dei gloriam]]''.]]The synthesis between faith and reason, coupled with BC's inclusive founding mission, attracts students and faculty from diverse religious traditions and a broad range of convictions. Campus spiritual activities are open to all, though entirely optional and include [[Catholic]] liturgies as well as religious services in various [[Protestant]], [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]], [[Jewish]], [[Muslim]], [[Buddhist]], and other traditions. The Jesuit call to justice is evident in work across religious boundaries in community service, reflection retreats, and immersion programs both on campus and abroad. Alumni also reflect this commitment to humanitarian work: BC ranks eleventh among [[Peace Corps]] volunteer-producing colleges.{{fact|date=February 2007}}

==Athletics==
{{main|Boston College Eagles}}
[[Image:Baldwin the Eagle.jpg|thumb|right|Boston College Baldwin the Eagle Mascot]]
The mascot for all Boston College athletic teams is the [[Eagle]], generally referred to in the plural, i.e., "The Eagles". The character representing the mascot at football, hockey, and basketball games is an American bald eagle named [[Baldwin the Eagle|Baldwin]], derived from the "bald" head of the American bald eagle and the word "win".

The school colors are [[maroon (color)|maroon]] and [[gold (color)|gold]]. The fight song, ''[[For Boston]]'', was composed by T.J. Hurley, class of 1885.

The Eagles compete in [[NCAA Division I-A]] as members of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] in all sports offered by the ACC. The men's and women's ice hockey teams compete in [[Hockey East]]. (Skiing, fencing, and sailing are also non-ACC.) Boston College is one of only thirteen universities in the country offering NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (Formerly, I-A) football, Division I men's and women's basketball, and Division I hockey.

In hockey and (less famously) baseball, Boston College participates in the annual [[Beanpot (ice hockey)|Beanpot]] tournaments held at [[TD Banknorth Garden]] and [[Fenway Park]], respectively. Boston College competes in the Beanpot against the three other major sports colleges in Boston: the [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]] [[Northeastern Huskies|Huskies]], [[Harvard University]] Crimson, and [[Boston University]] [[Boston University Terriers|Terriers]]. BC has reached the championship game 29 times and has won the Beanpot 14 times, including the 2008 championship. The less renowned baseball tournament, was first played in 1990 and out of seventeen baseball Beanpots, Boston College has won nine, last winning in 2008. The baseball team also plays an exhibition game against the [[Boston Red Sox]] at [[City Of Palms Park]] in [[Fort Myers, Florida|Ft. Myers]], [[Florida]] during [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[spring training]].

The Men's Hockey Team won the [[2008 NCAA Hockey Championship|2008 NCAA Championship]] on April 12 with a 4-1 victory over the University of Notre Dame in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]].

Principal athletic facilities include [[Alumni Stadium]] (capacity: 44,500), [[Conte Forum]] (8,606), [[Kelley Rink]] (7,884), [[Shea Field]] (1,000), the Newton Soccer Complex (1,000), and the Flynn Recreation Complex. The [[Yawkey Athletics Center]] opened in the spring of 2005. BC students compete in 31 varsity sports<ref name=varsity>[http://bceagles.cstv.com/genrel/bc-acc-profiles.html Boston College - General Releases<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> as well as a number of club and intramural teams. On March 18, 2002, Boston College's Athletics program was named to the College Sports Honor Roll as one of the nation's top 20 athletic programs by ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''.<ref>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/020318/archive_020363.htm ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''</ref>

Although a founding member of the [[Big East Conference]], the Eagles left the Big East and joined the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] on July 1, 2005.

Boston College athletes are among the most academically successful in the nation, according to the NCAA's [[Academic Progress Rate]] (APR). In 2006 Boston College received Public Recognition Awards with fourteen of its sports in the top 10% of the nation academically. The Eagles tied [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] for the highest total of any Division I-A university. Other schools having ten or more sports honored included [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] (12), [[Stanford University|Stanford]] (11), and [[Duke University|Duke]] (11). Teams honored were football, men's fencing, men's outdoor track, men's skiing, women's rowing, women's cross country, women's fencing, women's field hockey, women's indoor track, women's outdoor track, women's skiing, women's swimming, women's soccer, women's tennis, and women's volleyball. Boston College's football program was one of only five Division I-A teams that were so honored. The other four were [[Auburn University|Auburn]], Navy, Stanford, and Duke.

===Basketball===
The [[Boston College Eagles basketball]] program has achieved recent and prolonged success under head coach [[Al Skinner]]. The team has recently reached the sweet sixteen of the NCAA tournament (2006) and has made the transition to the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]].

===Football===
{{main|Boston College Eagles football}}
The Boston College Eagles have achieved much success in college football. On November 16, 1940, BC's [[Frank Leahy]]-coached championship team took a win from two-season undefeated Georgetown in the final seconds in a game that renowned sportswriter [[Grantland Rice]] called the greatest ever played. The Eagles completed their only undefeated season with a bowl victory over Tennessee that year, and many historians argue that the Eagles deserved a share of the national championship.{{fact|date=June 2008}} In 1942, the team spent three weeks ranked at #3 in the nation and one week at #1, but they were upset by a then-dominant [[College of the Holy Cross|Holy Cross]], 55-12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southbendtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071010/SPORTS13/710100416/1021/Sports |title=It's the heart of the matter|date=2007-10-10|work=[[South Bend Tribune]]}}</ref> As a result, the team canceled a party at the [[Cocoanut Grove]], which ended up as a wise thing to do because that night the club [[Cocoanut Grove fire|caught fire]].

Boston College's two most famous football victories came in dramatic fashion, on the final play of the game. On the day after Thanksgiving, November 23, 1984, before a national audience on [[CBS]], [[Doug Flutie]] became a legend when his {{convert|48|yd|sing=on}} [[Hail Mary pass|Hail Mary]] found its way into the arms of Gerard Phelan for a 47-45 victory over Miami in the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]]. This was also the year Flutie won the [[Heisman Trophy|Heisman]]; the only Eagle to date so honored. (''See also: [[Flutie effect]]'')

Nine years later almost to the day (November 20, 1993), the Eagles went into South Bend and defeated top-ranked Notre Dame 41-39 on a 41-yard field goal by [[David Gordon]] as time expired. A win would have completed Notre Dame's season at 11-0 with a berth in the national championship game. (''See also: [[Holy War (Boston College vs. Notre Dame)]]'')

An additional nine years later, BC again thwarted a potential Notre Dame perfect season, defeating the #2 Fighting Irish in South Bend, 14-7. Boston College ran their football winning streak over Notre Dame to five games in 2007 with a 27-14 victory, helping the Eagles rise to #2 in the BCS rankings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=272860087|publisher=[[ESPN]]|title=Challenger's TD catch helps Boston College thwart Irish rally - NCAA College Football Recap}}</ref>

On October 21, 2007, Boston College received its highest ranking since 1942, coming in at #2 nationally in both the [[AP Poll]] and in the [[USA Today]]/[[Coaches' Poll]].

The Eagles beat [[2007 Virginia Tech Hokies football team|Virginia Tech]] on October 25, 2007, led by [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]] with two touchdown passes in the final 2:11 of the game. This win solidified their spot at #2 in both the AP and Coaches' Poll as well as the [[Bowl Championship Series#Rankings|BCS rankings]].

{{main|List of Boston College people}}
"The Heights" is a nickname given to Boston College. It recalls both BC's lofty aspirations &mdash; the college motto is "[[Ever to Excel]]" &mdash; and its hilltop location, an area initially designated as "University Heights". The name has lent itself to a number of campus organizations, most notably the principal student newspaper, ''[[The Heights (newspaper)|The Heights]]''. BC students were universally called "'''Heightsmen'''" until 1925 when Mary C. Mellyn became the first "'''Heightswoman'''" to receive a BC degree. "'''Heightsonian'''" was originally conceived{{fact|date=June 2008}} as a way to gender neutralize the original term "Heightsmen", though "'''Eagles'''", once exclusively used for members of the University's athletics teams, is more commonly used.<ref name=disamBCM /> Contrary to its occasional usage by misinformed sportswriters and announcers,{{fact|date=March 2007}} the term "Golden Eagles" refers strictly to BC graduates who have celebrated their 50th anniversary reunion.
