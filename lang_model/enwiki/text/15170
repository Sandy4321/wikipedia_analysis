'''Screw theory''' is a conceptual framwork developed by Sir [[Robert Stawell Ball]] in 1876 for application in [[kinematics]] and [[statics]] of [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]]s (rigid body mechanics). Screw theory notes that all rigid-body motion can be represented as rotation about an axis along with translation along the ''same'' axis. In this framework, screw theory expresses displacements, velocities, forces, and torques in three dimensional space. Recently screw theory has regained importance and has become an important tool in robot mechanics, mechanical design, [[computational geometry]] and [[multibody dynamics]]. This is in part because it provides a unique coordinate-system-independent way to interpolate [[rigid-body motion]]s (the same one given by the [[exponential map]] on [[homogeneous transformation matrices]]). Fundamental theorems include [[Poinsot's  theorem]] ([[Louis Poinsot]], 1806) and [[Chasles' theorem]] ([[Michel Chasles]], 1832). Other prominent contributors include [[Julius Pl<U+00FC>cker]], [[W. K. Clifford]], [[F. M. Dimentberg]], [[Kenneth H. Hunt]], J. R. Phillips.

[[Euler's rotation theorem]] states that any rotation can be described as a rotation about a single axis by a given angle. In general, this is a unique representation (with the exception of zero rotation having an undefined axis and rotation of 180<U+00B0> having an ambiguity in axis direction corresponding to [[gimbal lock]]). Screw theory extends this notion to include translation.

== Basic concepts ==
We define three terms: screw, twist, and wrench:

=== Screw ===
In the sense of rigid body motion, a screw is a way of describing a displacement.  It can be thought of as a rotation about an axis and a translation along that same axis.  Any general displacement can be described by a screw, and there are methods of converting  between screws and other representations of displacements, such as [[homographic transformation]]s. 

In [[rigid body dynamics]], velocities of a [[rigid body]] and the forces and torques acting upon it can be represented by the concept of a screw.  The first kind of screw is called a '''twist''', and represents the velocity of a body by the direction of its linear [[velocity]], its [[angular velocity]] about the axis of translation, and the relationship between the two, called the pitch.  The second kind of screw is called a '''wrench''', and it relates the force and torque acting on a body in a similar way.

Apart from the internal force that keeps the body together this motion does not require a force to be maintained, provided that the direction is a [[moment of inertia|principal axis]] of the body. 

In general, a three dimensional motion can be defined using a screw with a given direction and pitch. Six parameters are required to fully define a screw motion, the 4 components needed to define the screw axis, plus the angular rotation about and linear translation along that line.  The traditional (alternative) method of characterizing 3-D motion using [[Euler Angles]] likewise requires 6 parameters, 3 rotation angles and a 3x1 translation vector.

A pure screw is simply a geometric concept which describes a helix.  A screw with zero pitch looks like a circle.  A screw with infinite pitch looks like a straight line, but is not well defined.

Any motion along a screw can be decomposed into a rotation about an axis followed by a translation along that axis.  Any general displacement of a rigid body can therefore be described by a screw.

=== Twist ===

Twists represent velocity of a body.  For example, if you were climbing up a spiral staircase at a constant speed, your velocity would be easily described by a twist. A twist contains six quantities: three linear and three angular. Another way of decomposing a twist is by four line coordinates (see [[Pl<U+00FC>cker coordinates]]), one scalar [[pitch (screw)|pitch]] value, and one twist magnitude.

=== Wrench ===

A '''wrench''' generalizes force and torque in the same way a screw generalizes linear and rotational displacement.  One way to conceptualize this is to consider someone who is fastening two wooden boards together with a metal [[screw]].  The person turns the screw (applies a torque), which then experiences a net force along its axis of rotation.

=== Transformations ===
==== Twists ====
The velocities of each particle within a [[Rigid Body#Other quantities|rigid body]] define a helical field called the velocity twist. To move representation from point A to point B, one must account for the rotation of the body such that:

[[Image:Velocity twist.jpg]]

In screw notation velocity twists transform with a 6x6 transformation matrix

<math>\hat{v_B} = \begin{bmatrix} \vec v_B \\ \vec \omega \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & - [\vec r_{AB}]_\times \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} \vec v_A \\ \vec \omega \end{bmatrix} </math>

Where:
*<math>\vec v_A</math> denotes the linear velocity at point A
*<math>\vec v_B</math> denotes the linear velocity at point B
*<math>\vec \omega</math> denotes the angular velocity of the rigid body
*<math>[\vec r_{AB}]_\times </math> denotes the 3<U+00D7>3 [[Cross product#Conversion_to_matrix_multiplication|cross product matrix]]

==== Wrenches ====
Similarly the equipolent moments expressed at each location within a [[rigid body]] define a helical field called the force wrench. To move representation from point A to point B, once must account for the forces on the body such that:

[[Image:Force wrench.jpg]]

In screw notation force wrenches transform with a 6x6 transformation matrix

<math>\hat{\tau}_B = \begin{bmatrix} \vec F \\ \vec \tau_B \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ - [\vec r_{AB}]_\times & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} \vec F \\ \vec \tau_A \end{bmatrix} </math>

Where:
*<math>\vec \tau_A</math> denotes the [[equipollent]] (link: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Statics/Resultants_of_Force_Systems_(contents) wikibooks.org] ) moment at point A
*<math>\vec \tau_B</math> denotes the [[equipollent]] (link: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Statics/Resultants_of_Force_Systems_(contents) wikibooks.org] ) moment at point B
*<math>\vec F</math> denotes the total force applied to the rigid body
*<math>[\vec r_{AB}]_\times </math> denotes the 3<U+00D7>3 [[Cross product#Conversion_to_matrix_multiplication|cross product matrix]]

== Twists as general displacements ==

Given an initial configuration <math>g\left(0\right) \in SE\left(n\right)</math>, and a twist <math>\xi \in R^n</math>, the homogeneous transformation to a new location and orientation can be computed with the following formula:

<math> g\left(\theta\right) = \exp(\hat{\xi}\theta) g\left(0\right)</math>

where <math>\theta</math> represents the parameters of the transformation.

== Calculating twists ==

Twists can be easily calculated for certain common robotic joints.  

=== Revolute Joints ===

For a [[revolute joint]], given the axis of revolution <math> \omega \in R^3 </math> and a point <math>q \in R^3</math> on that axis, the twist for the joint can be calculated with the following formula:

<math> \xi =  \begin{bmatrix} q \times \omega \\ \omega \end{bmatrix}</math>

=== Prismatic Joints ===

For a [[prismatic joint]], given a vector <math>v \in R^3</math> pointing in the direction of translation, the twist for the joint can be calculated with the following formula:


<math> \xi =  \begin{bmatrix} v \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}</math>

==Calculus of screws==
The science of screw mapping has been advanced by the use of [[dual quaternion]]s developed by [[W.K. Clifford]], [[Eduard Study]], F.M. Dimentberg, and more recently by A.T. Yang (see reference). In brief, multiplications of [[dual number]]s correspond to [[shear mapping]], and [[inner automorphism]]s by unit [[quaternion]]s model rotations about an axis; the synthesis of these operations in the dual quaternions displays the screw mapping through a [[ring theory|ring]] multiplication. The transformation of equation (24) on page 271 of Yang's 1974 essay is an example of the application of a projectivity in [[inversive ring geometry]].

==Reciprocity of twist and wrench==
A wrench <math>\hat{f}</math> acting on a rigid body moving with a twist
<math>\hat{v}</math> are '''reciprocal''' if the motion generated no power
against the force:

: <math> \hat{f}^\top \hat{v} = \begin{bmatrix} \vec f \\ \vec \tau \end{bmatrix}^\top
\begin{bmatrix} \vec v \\ \vec \omega \end{bmatrix} = \vec f^\top \vec v +
\vec \tau^\top \vec \omega = 0.</math>
