'''Robert William "Bob" Meusel''' ([[July 19]] [[1896]] <U+2013> [[November 28]] [[1977]]) was a  [[Major League Baseball]] [[outfielder]] who played eleven seasons between the years {{by|1920}} to {{by|1930}}, all but one for the [[New York Yankees]]. He was best known as a member of the fabled "[[Murderers' Row]]" of the New York Yankees championship teams of the 1920s. 

Meusel, a [[left fielder]] noted for his strong throwing arm, batted fifth behind [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]r's [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Lou Gehrig]].<ref name=obit>{{cite web|url=http://thedeadballera.com/Obits/Meusel.Bob.Obit.html|accessdate=2007-07-30|date=[[1977-11-30]]|title=Meusel, Yankees Outfielder Dies|publisher=New York Times}}</ref>  He led the [[American League]] in [[home run]]s (33), [[run batted in|runs batted in]] (138) and extra-base hits (79) in {{by|1925}}. Nicknamed "Long Bob" because of his height, Meusel hit a .309 career [[batting average]] while making 368 [[double (baseball)|doubles]], 94 [[triple (baseball)|triples]], 156 home runs, and driving in 1,067 runs in his career. Meusel played his entire career with the Yankees, with the exception of the 1930 season in which he played for the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. He drove in 100 runs five times and hit .300 seven times. He [[hitting for the cycle|hit for the cycle]] a record-tying three times. 

His brother, [[Irish Meusel|Irish]], was a star outfielder in the [[National League]]. He had a comparable career batting average (.310) but, unlike Meusel, he had a weak throwing arm which prevented him from being a great  outfielder.<ref name=obit/>

==Professional career==
Meusel was signed by the [[New York Yankees]] in August 1919. After a productive [[spring training]], Meusel replaced future Hall of Famer [[Frank Baker]] at third base.<ref name=Baker>{{cite news|title=Meusel will play third for the Yankees|publisher = The New York Times|page=12|date=[[April 1]], [[1920]]|accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> He played his first game on April 14, {{by|1920}}. In his rookie season, Meusel had a .328 batting average with 11 [[home run]]s and 83 [[runs batted in]] in 119 games. He finished fourth in the League in doubles with 41 while sharing time with [[Duffy Lewis]] on left field.<ref name=stats>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/m/meusebo01.shtml|accessdate=2007-07-30|title=Bob Meusel| publisher = Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> 

In the 1921 season, Meusel started 149 out of 154 games. He batted .318, finishing second in the league with 24 home runs and third in the league with 136 runs batted in.<ref name=1921season>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/worldseries/1921.html|date = 2002|accessdate=2007-07-31|title=History of the World Series - 1921|publisher=[[The Sporting News]]}}</ref><ref name=stats/> He broke a club record and led the league in outfield assists with 21, and was considered to be one of the league's best all-around players.<ref name="assists">{{cite book |title=The Yankee Encyclopedia|author=Mark Gallagher

Meusel's brother, Irish, was acquired by the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] from the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in mid-season, and helped lead the Giants to the pennant. The two brothers played against each other in the [[1921 World Series|World Series]] where the Giants faced their tenants (the Yankees played their home games in the Polo Grounds, the ball park owned by the Giants). Meusel stole home in Game 3 of the Series.<ref name=obit/> He doubled in [[Babe Ruth]] for the winning run in Game 5 for a one-game lead, but the Yankees lost the next three games and the Series (the last best of nine in World Series history).<ref name=1921season/> His batting average in those eight games was a mere .200.<ref name=stats/>

At the same time, Meusel, [[Bill Piercy]], and Ruth signed up to play in a [[barnstorming]] tour. It was a violation of baseball rules at the time, and the two players had previously been warned about playing with the tour. As punishment the [[Commissioner of Baseball]], [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]], suspended them for the first five weeks of the {{by|1922}} season and fined them their World Series cash share of $3,362 each.<ref name="suspended">{{cite book |title=Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig|author=Jonathan Eig|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=0743245911 |pages=108}}</ref> That season he only played in 121 games, hitting .319 with 16 home runs and 84 runs batted in.<ref name=stats/> He hit for the cycle for the second time of his career in a win against the [[Detroit Tigers]] on July 21. The Yankees managed to win the division title for the second year in a row, but this time they were beaten by the Giants in five games. Meusel had the highest batting average of the Yankees in the Series with .300.<ref name=high>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1922_WS.shtml|accessdate=2007-07-30|title=1922 World Series (4-0-1): New York Giants (93&ndash;61) over New York Yankees (94&ndash;60) | publisher = Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref>

In {{by|1923}}, Meusel hit .313 with nine home runs and 91 runs batted in.<ref name=stats/> Meusel helped lead the Yankees to their first [[1923 World Series|World Series]] title against the Giants.

Before the {{by|1924}} season started, Meusel's close friend [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]] [[shortstop]] [[Tony Boeckel]] was killed when the car he was riding in flipped over in [[New York City]]. Meusel was a passenger in the vehicle but escaped unhurt.<ref name="caraccident">{{cite book |title=Ninety Feet from Fame: Close Calls With Baseball Immortality|author=Mike Robbins|publisher=Carroll & Graf Publishers|isbn=0786713356|pages=173}}</ref> That year Meusel hit .320 with 12 home runs and 120 runs batted in, playing in 143 games. In a game against the [[Detroit Tigers]] on June 13, Meusel was involved in one of the most notorious brawls in baseball history. With the Yankees leading 10&ndash;6 in the top of the ninth inning, [[Ty Cobb]], the manager of the Tigers, gave pitcher [[Bert Cole]] the signal to hit Meusel with a pitch. Ruth saw the signal and warned Meusel. Meusel was hit in the back and rushed to fight Cole. The benches cleared, and Cobb and Ruth started fighting as well.<ref name="fight">{{cite book |title=And the Skipper Bats Cleanup: A History of the Baseball Player-Manager|author=Fred Stein|publisher=McFarland & Company|isbn=0786412283|pages=148}}</ref> Over a thousand fans rushed to the field and a riot erupted.

Meusel had a breakout year in {{by|1925}}. He led the [[American League]] in [[home run]]s (33), [[run batted in|runs batted in]] (138), games played (156) and extra-base hits (79). Despite this, Meusel finished a mere tie for 18th, 40 points behind winner (and former Yankee) [[Roger Peckinpaugh]] of the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]] for the [[Most Valuable Player]] award. The Yankees had the worst season of the decade, finishing seventh in the division with a 69&ndash;85 record. However, in the {{by|1926}} season, Meusel only played in 108 games. He batted .315 with 12 home runs and 81 runs batted in.<ref name=stats/> In the [[1926 World Series]] against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], Meusel dropped a key fly ball in the sixth inning of Game 7 that caused the Cardinals to tie the game, and later score.<ref name="keyflyball">{{cite book |title=Branch Rickey: Baseball's Ferocious Gentleman|author=Lee Lowenfish|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803211031 |page=167 }}</ref> Meusel had a chance to redeem himself in the bottom of the ninth inning. The starting pitcher of the game, [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]], retired the first two batters and then walked Ruth. Meusel was on-deck when Ruth tried to steal [[second base]] and catcher [[Bob O'Farrell]] threw him out, ending both the game and the Series; Meusel only hit .238 .<ref name=Ruthstolenbase>{{cite news|author=Murray Chass|title=When a Seventh Game is Necessary:High Drama|publisher = The New York Times|page=207|date=[[October 26]], [[1986]]|accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref>

Meusel was a key member of the [[1927 New York Yankees]] team, which many consider to be one of the greatest baseball teams ever.

==Retirement==
After retiring from baseball, Meusel was a security guard at a US Navy base for 15 years.<ref name="family"/> He was in attendance when his former teammate [[Lou Gehrig]] made his famous [[Lou Gehrig#"The Luckiest Man on the Face of the Earth"|"The Luckiest Man on the Face of the Earth"]] speech on [[July 4]], {{by|1939}}.<ref name="lucky">{{cite book |title=A Legend in the Making, The New York Yankees in 1939|author=Richard Tofel|publisher=Ivan R.

Meusel died of [[Death by natural causes|natural causes]] at his home in [[Downey, California]] at the age of 81. He is buried at [[Rose Hills Memorial Park]] in [[Whittier, California]].

== Legacy ==
Meusel received the most recognition for being a member of the [[Murderers' Row]] teams of the mid-1920s, which included Ruth, Gehrig, [[second baseman]] [[Tony Lazzeri]] and [[center fielder]] [[Earle Combs]]. He shares the record for the most times hitting for the cycle with three, along with [[Babe Herman]] and [[John Reilly (baseball)|John Reilly]]. Meusel had one of the strongest arms of the era. In his obituary, the [[New York Times]] called his throwing arm "deadly accurate".<ref name=obit/> Hall of Fame manager [[Casey Stengel]] said that he had never seen a better thrower than Bob Meusel.<ref name=obit/> Meusel occasionally played [[right field]] in Yankees  games away from home to protect Ruth from the sun, as the sun  affected Ruth's skill as an outfielder.<ref name=affected>{{cite web|url=http://archive.sportingnews.com/baseball/al100/seasons/slideshows/1927/5.html|accessdate=2007-07-31|title=100 Years of the American League|publisher=The Sporting News}}</ref> 

Harvey Frommer  described Meusel  as a heavy drinker and womanizer who did not get along with his teammates. His manager [[Miller Huggins]] called him "indifferent".<ref name="indifferent">{{cite book |title=A Yankees Century, A Celebration of the First Hundred Years of Baseball's Greatest Team|author=Harvey Frommer|publisher=The Berkley Publishing Group|isbn=0-425-18617-2|pages=196}}</ref> He was quiet and reserved, rarely giving newspaper interviews until his career was winding down.<ref name="quiet">{{cite book |title=A Farewell to Heroes|author=Frank Graham|publisher=Southern Illinois Univ Press|isbn=0809324911|pages=207}}</ref> He was also known for his lazy attitude, such as refusing to run down ground balls, which many said kept him from achieving greatness.<ref>Eig: pg. 95</ref>
