'''State Route 266''' (SR 266) is a state highway in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. The route is a connector between [[Nevada State Route 264]] and [[Nevada State Route 266]], and it can serve as transportation of agricultural goods between California and Nevada via the route's only junction [[California State Route 168|State Route 168]]. In the event that SR 168 is closed, SR 266 connects to [[Nevada State Route 264]], which intersects with [[U.S. Route 6]] in order to provide an alternate access to California.

==Route description==
[[File:CA Route 266.JPG|200px|thumb|Southern terminus of SR 266 at the Nevada state line]]
State Route 266 is part of the [[California Freeway and Expressway System]].<ref name="cafes">[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=shc&group=00001-01000&file=250-257 CA Codes (shc:250-257)]</ref> The entire route, consisting of two lanes for two-way traffic, traverses on the flat land in the [[Fish Lake Valley]] east of the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains]].<ref name="TCR">{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist9/planning/docs/tcr_sr266.pdf|title=State Route 266 - Transportation Concept Report|date=June 2008|publisher=[[California Department of Transportation|Caltrans]]}}</ref>

State Route 266 begins at the western terminus of [[Nevada State Route 266]] at the Nevada state line. The route travels west-northwest, then turns to the west for about another 1.8 miles before approaching [[Oasis, Mono County, California|Oasis]], the only unincorporated community that the route passes through. At Oasis, SR 266 meets at the intersection with [[California State Route 168|SR 168]] which serves as the gateway into the [[Owens Valley]] from Nevada. Upon leaving Oasis, SR 266 continues to the west briefly, then turns to north-northwest. Within the last 7 miles, SR 266 slowly curves more towards northwest as the route approaches the Nevada state line. The route ends at the state line at the southern terminus of [[Nevada State Route 264]].<ref name="TCR"/>

==History==
The segment of present day SR 266 from Oasis to [[Nevada State Route 264]] was incorporated into the State Highway System in 1933; it was defined as Legislative Route 63.<ref name="TCR"/><ref name=CAHighways>{{cite web|url=http://www.cahighways.org/265-272.html|author=Faigin, Daniel|title=California Highways - Routes 265 through 272}}</ref>
The route remained unchanged until 1964, when in that year the route's name was designated as Mono County Road 101.<ref>"The route from Oasis to
northern Nevada State line via Mono County Road 101." California Freeway and Expressway System, Chapter 1875. 1964.</ref> In 1984, the definition was modified to redesignate the segment as an extension of State Route 168 in order for that route to be connected to Nevada.<ref>"The route from Oasis to
northern Nevada State line." California Freeway and Expressway System, Chapter 409. 1984.</ref> Two years later, in 1986, there was a construction of a new segment traveling east from Oasis and connecting to [[Nevada State Route 266]]. When the extension was complete, the two segments <U+2013> the SR 168 extension and the newly completed <U+2013> was assigned SR 266.<ref name=CAHighways/>
