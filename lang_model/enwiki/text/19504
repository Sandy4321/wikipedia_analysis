'''Rakeback''' began in 2004. It is a scheme whereby [[online poker]] sites and their [[affiliate]] partners return part of the [[rake]] or tournament entries a player pays as an incentive for them to stay with that site; these are in the form of rakeback (otherwise known as loyalty bonus and sometimes reward points) <ref>[http://www.cardplayer.com/cardplayer-magazines/65729-john-juanda-5-12/articles/18053-the-perks-of-online-poker-rakeback CardPlayer] The perks of online poker rakeback</ref>.

==Overview==
Rakeback in cash games can be calculated using two different methods: dealt and contributed. The dealt method awards the same amount of rakeback to each player dealt into the hand and the contributed method rewards players based on their actual contribution to the pot. In poker tournaments, rakeback is deducted from cardroom's entry fee. Rakeback is technically similar to comps in "brick and mortar" casinos.
Rakeback software has been developed over the past few years to assist poker rooms or affiliates with the administration and calculation of player's rakeback.

Every online poker room offers some form of rakeback. Sites such as [[Full Tilt Poker]], [[CakePoker]] and [[UltimateBet]] allow affiliates to offer rakeback as a direct percentage of rake and tournament entries paid back to the players. Other rooms such as [[PokerStars]], [[PartyPoker]] and the [[iPoker Network]] forbid affiliates to give rakeback, however they offer in house loyalty programs that gives cash and other rewards to players based upon how much they play <ref>[http://www.flopturnriver.com/blogs/make-thousands-by-playing-at-pokerstars-in-2010-12085 Flop Turn River] - PokerStars VIP Program</ref>. 

In 2009 some networks began to block players from their sites who were winning too much. [[Bodog]] took a stance opposite of this, welcoming winning players yet rewarding those affiliates and partners who brought in a great deal of new depositors. <ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bodog-network-rakeback-clarification-80617827.html PRNewsWire.com] Bodog Network Rakeback Clarificaiton</ref>
