'''''Hello, Dolly!''''' is a [[Musical theater|musical]] with lyrics and music by [[Jerry Herman]] and a book by [[Michael Stewart (playwright)|Michael Stewart]], based on [[Thornton Wilder]]'s 1938 [[farce]] ''[[The Merchant of Yonkers]]'', which Wilder revised and retitled ''[[The Matchmaker]]'' in 1955.  

''Hello, Dolly!'' was first produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] by [[David Merrick]] in 1964, winning the [[Tony Award]] for Best Musical and nine other Tonys.  It has become one of the most enduring [[musical theatre]] hits, enjoying three Broadway revivals and international success.  It was also made into a [[Hello, Dolly! (film)|1969 film]] that was nominated for seven [[Academy Award]]s.

==Background==
The plot of ''Hello, Dolly!'' originated in ''[[Einen Jux will er sich machen]]'' (''He Intends to Have a Fling''), an 1842 play by [[Austria]]n [[Johann Nestroy]], which was itself based on an 1835 English play, ''A Day Well Spent''.  Wilder adapted Nestroy's play into his 1938 farcical play, ''The Merchant of Yonkers'', a flop, which he revised, expanding the role of Dolly, and retitled ''[[The Matchmaker]]'' in 1955, starring [[Ruth Gordon]].  ''The Matchmaker'' became a hit and was much revived and made into a [[1958 in film|1958 film]] of the same name starring [[Shirley Booth]].  The story of a meddlesome widow who strives to bring romance to several couples and herself in a big city restaurant also features prominently in the 1891 hit musical ''[[A Trip to Chinatown]]''.<ref>Curtain Up article</ref>

Although the part of Dolly Levi in the musical was originally written for [[Ethel Merman]], she turned it down, giving Carol Channing the opportunity to create her most memorable role.<ref>Musicals101 article</ref>  Director [[Gower Champion]] was not the producers' first choice, either; [[Hal Prince]] and other directors turned down the job of directing the musical.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} ''Hello, Dolly!'' had rocky out-of-town tryouts in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>Musicals101 article</ref> After receiving the reviews, four songs were dropped and "Before the Parade Passes By" was added. Further work was done on the script and score.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}  ''Hello, Dolly!'' was originally entitled ''Dolly, A Damned Exasperating Woman'',<ref>Bloom, p. 152</ref> until Merrick heard [[Louis Armstrong]]'s recording of the song and changed the name of the show.

''Dolly'' would become the second-longest running show in Broadway history up to that time, being surpassed only by ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''.  According to the 2004 book, ''Broadway: The American Musical'', the Broadway production of ''Hello Dolly'' grossed US$27 million.  "The 1960s was the decade that nurtured long-running blockbusters in unprecedented quantities: ten musicals passed the rarefied 1,000 performance mark, three of them passed the 2,000 mark...."<ref>Kantor, p. 302, also noting that "''Fiddler on the Roof'' passed the 3,000 mark, earning back $1,574 for every dollar put into it."</ref>  ''Hello, Dolly!'' and ''Fiddler'' remained the longest-running Broadway record holders for almost 10 years until ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' pushed them both down a rank.

==Productions==
The original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, directed and [[choreographed]] by [[Gower Champion]] and produced by David Merrick, opened to rave reviews<ref>Bovson article</ref> on [[January 16]] [[1964]] at the [[St. James Theatre]], becoming a Broadway blockbuster in the 1960s and running for 2,844 performances.  The title role was written with [[Ethel Merman]] in mind, but she declined, as did [[Mary Martin]]. The part eventually went to [[Carol Channing]]. The supporting cast included [[David Burns (actor)|David Burns]] as Horace, [[Charles Nelson Reilly]] as Cornelius, [[Eileen Brennan]] as Irene, Jerry Dodge as Barnaby, Sondra Lee as Minnie Fay, [[Alice Playten]] as Ermengarde, and Igors Gavon as Ambrose.  Although facing stiff competition from ''[[Funny Girl]]'' with [[Barbra Streisand]], ''Hello, Dolly!'' swept the [[Tony Award]]s that season, winning awards in ten categories (out of eleven nominations), a record that remained unbroken for 37 years until ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' won twelve Tonys in 2001.  

After Channing left the production, Merrick kept the show playing to capacity houses by casting big name stars in the title role, including [[Ginger Rogers]], [[Martha Raye]], [[Betty Grable]], [[Pearl Bailey]] (in an all-black version with [[Cab Calloway]]), [[Dorothy Lamour]], [[Phyllis Diller]], and [[Ethel Merman]], for whom Herman originally wrote the show.  Two songs cut prior to the opening <U+2014> typical Mermanesque "belters" entitled "World, Take Me Back" and "Love, Look in My Window" <U+2014> were restored for her run.

''Hello, Dolly!'' was revived three times on Broadway, including an all-black production (with Bailey and [[Billy Daniels]]) in 1975 (42 performances), and two with Channing, the first in 1978 (147 performances), the second in 1994 (116 performances).  It was also made into a [[Hello, Dolly! (film)|1969 musical film]], directed by [[Gene Kelly]] and starring [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Walter Matthau]], that was nominated for seven [[Academy Award]]s and won three (including Best Music).

The musical has also enjoyed international success. [[Mary Martin]] played ''Dolly'' in the West End production of ''Hello, Dolly!'', as well as in [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]] for a special U.S.O. performance for U.S. troops. The original German production of ''Hello, Dolly!'', with the title character's surname "Wassiljewa" (Vasilyeva) rather than "Levi," starred Tatjana Iwanow (Tatyana Ivanov). In 1996, Mexican diva [[Silvia Pinal]] starred in the [[Spanish language]] version of the musical ''<U+00BF>Qu<U+00E9> tal Dolly?'' ("What's Up, Dolly?") opposite Ignacio Lopez Tarso in [[Mexico City]].{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

==Synopsis==
'''Act I'''

Widowed but brassy matchmaker Dolly Gallagher Levi makes a living through what she calls "meddling" <U+2013> matchmaking and numerous sidelines including dance instruction and [[mandolin]] lessons.  She travels to [[Yonkers, New York]] to visit her client, grumpy Horace Vandergelder, a prominent citizen and wealthy bachelor in need of a wife to tend to himself and his home. 
It is soon clear, however, that Dolly intends to marry Horace herself and to "send his money circulating among the people like rainwater," the way her late husband taught her.

At Vandergelder's Hay and Feed Store in Yonkers, Dolly convinces Vandergelder, his two stock clerks, Cornelius Hackl and Barnaby Tucker, his weepy niece Ermengarde, and her artistic beau Ambrose Kemper, to "put on [their] Sunday clothes<U+201D> and take the train to [[New York City]].  Cornelius, Barnaby, Dolly and Horace all arrive at the hat shop of widow Irene Molloy.  Dolly cleverly steers Horace away from Irene, with whom she is supposed to be setting him up, and instead arranges a match between the two clerks and the bored [[milliner]] and her perky shop assistant, Minnie Fay. Dolly catches up with the annoyed Vandergelder as he is playing in a band during the great Fourteenth Street Association Parade, and she convinces him to give her matchmaking one more chance.  She tells him of a lonely heiress that would be perfect for him, and asks him to meet her at the swanky Harmonia Gardens that evening. Alone, she decides to put her dearly departed husband Ephram behind her, and move on with life "Before the Parade Passes By". 

'''Act II'''

Dolly has now arranged for everyone to meet at the Harmonia Gardens.  Ermengarde and Ambrose have entered the polka competition, so Ambrose can demonstrate his ability to be a bread winner to Uncle Horace. Cornelius and Barnaby are taking Irene and Minnie there on a date and are determined to get a kiss before the night is over. As the clerks have no money for a carriage, they convince the girls that walking to the restaurant shows that they've "got elegance".  At the Gardens, Dolly makes her triumphant return and is greeted in style by the restaurant staff ("Hello, Dolly!").  A web of complicated entanglements ensues, culminating in a free-for-all and a trip to night court.  Cornelius professes his love for Irene, Barnaby for Minnie, and Ambrose for Ermengarde.  Dolly convinces the judge that the only thing everyone is guilty of is being in love.  Everyone, that is, except Mr. Vandergelder.

Back at the hay and feed store, Cornelius and Irene, Barnaby and Minnie, and Ambrose and Ermengarde are each setting out on their own.  A chastened Horace Vandergelder finally admits that he needs Dolly in his life, but Dolly is unsure about the marriage until her late husband sends her a sign <U+2013> Vandergelder repeats a saying of Ephram's: "Money is like manure.  It's not worth a thing unless it's spread about, encouraging young things to grow."
