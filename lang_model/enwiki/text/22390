'''''Neoromicia malagasyensis''''' is a [[vespertilionid]] bat of [[Madagascar]] in the genus ''[[Neoromicia]]''. It is known only from the vicinity of the [[Isalo National Park]] in the southwestern part of the island, where it has been caught in riverine habitats. After the first specimen was caught in 1967, it was described as a [[subspecies]] of ''Eptesicus somalicus'' (now ''[[Neoromicia somalica]]'') in 1995. After four more specimens were collected in 2002 and 2003, it was recognized as a separate species. Because of its small distribution and the threat of [[habitat destruction]], it is considered "[[Endangered species|Endangered]]" in the [[IUCN Red List]].

''Neoromicia malagasyensis'' is a relatively small species, with a forearm length of 30 to 32&nbsp;mm (1.2 to 1.3&nbsp;in) and a body mass  of 3.9 to 9&nbsp;g (0.1 to 0.3&nbsp;oz). The fur is dark brown above and mixed buff and gray below. The ears are translucent and the [[tibia]] is short. The [[baculum]] (penis bone) resembles that of ''[[Neoromicia melckorum|N.&nbsp;melckorum]]'', but is smaller. The duration of the [[animal echolocation|echolocation]] call, which consists of a component with rapidly falling frequency and one showing more stable frequency, averages 4.9&nbsp;[[Millisecond|ms]] and the interval between calls averages 69.1&nbsp;ms.

==Taxonomy==
In their 1995 review of Malagasy bats, Randolph Peterson and colleagues established ''Eptesicus somalicus malagasyensis'', a new [[subspecies]] of ''Eptesicus somalicus''<ref name=Pea100>Peterson et al., 1995, p.&nbsp;100</ref> (currently ''[[Neoromicia somalica]]'').{{#tag:ref|''Neoromicia somalicus'' in Simmons (2005, p.&nbsp;495). However, Ricucci and Lanza (2008) indicated that the [[grammatical gender|gender]] of the name ''[[Neoromicia]]'' is feminine, and therefore the correct form is ''somalica''.<ref>Ricucci and Lanza, 2008, p.&nbsp;176</ref>|group=Note}} They had only a single specimen and noted that further material was needed to assess the new form's relationship with ''E.&nbsp;somalicus''.<ref name=Pea101>Peterson et al., 1995, p.&nbsp;101</ref> Studies in 2001 and 2002 provided evidence that ''E.&nbsp;somalicus'' and related species are not closely related to ''Eptesicus'' (nor to ''[[Pipistrellus]]'', where they have also been placed), so that these species were allocated to the separate genus ''[[Neoromicia]]''.<ref name=GR434>Goodman and Ranivo, 2004, p.&nbsp;434</ref> In 2004, [[Steven Goodman]] and Julie Ranivo reviewed the Malagasy subspecies after collecting two more specimens<ref name=GR435>Goodman and Ranivo, 2004, p.&nbsp;435</ref> and concluded that it was distinct enough to be classified as a separate species, ''Neoromicia malagasyensis''.<ref name=GR438>Goodman and Ranivo, 2004, p.&nbsp;438</ref> Two years later, Paul Bates and colleagues reported on two more specimens<ref name=Bea313/> and showed that the [[baculum|bacula]] (penis bones) of ''N.&nbsp;malagasyensis'' and ''N.&nbsp;somalica'' are different, providing further evidence that they are distinct species. However, they recommended that further research assess the degree of difference between ''N.&nbsp;malagasyensis'' and ''[[Neoromicia matroka|N.&nbsp;matroka]]'' (formerly in ''Eptesicus'', but placed in ''Neoromicia'' by Bates and colleagues), which occurs further east in Madagascar.<ref name=Bea315>Bates et al., 2006, p.&nbsp;315</ref> The [[IUCN Red List]] currently again classifies the species in ''Eptesicus'', as ''Eptesicus malagasyensis''.<ref name=iucn/>

''Neoromicia malagasyensis'' is one of at least six species of small [[Vespertilionidae|vespertilionid]] bats ("pipistrelles") on Madagascar, in addition to ''N.&nbsp;matroka'', ''[[Neoromicia melckorum|N.&nbsp;melckorum]]'', ''[[Pipistrellus hesperidus]]'', ''[[Pipistrellus raceyi|P.&nbsp;raceyi]]'', and ''[[Hypsugo anchietae]]''. The classification of these bats has historically been controversial, leading to many changing identifications and generic assignments.<ref>Bates et al., 2006, pp.&nbsp;299<U+2013>300</ref> The genus ''Neoromicia'' is exclusively African and included 11&nbsp;species in the 2005 third edition of ''Mammal Species of the World'';<ref>Simmons, 2005, pp.&nbsp;493<U+2013>495</ref> more species, like ''N.&nbsp;malagasyensis'' and ''N.&nbsp;matroka'', have been added since. [[Common name]]s proposed for this species include "Isalo Serotine"<ref name=iucn/> and "Peterson's 'pipistrelle{{'"}}.<ref name=Bea315/>

''Neoromicia malagasyensis'' is a relatively small "pipistrelle",<ref name=Bea313>Bates et al., 2006, p.&nbsp;313</ref> but larger than ''N.&nbsp;somalica''.<ref name=GR436>Goodman and Ranivo, 2004, p.&nbsp;436</ref> The fur on the back is long and dark brown and the underparts contain both gray and dark [[buff (colour)|buff]] hairs; there, the fur becomes lighter towards the tail.<ref name=Bea315/> The fur is darker than in ''N.&nbsp;somalica'',<ref name=Pea101/> but paler than in ''N.&nbsp;matroka''.<ref name=Bea321>Bates et al., 2006, p.&nbsp;321</ref> The brown ears are translucent.<ref name=Bea315/> The [[tragus (ear)|tragus]] (a projection on the inner side of the outer ear) is similar to that of ''N.&nbsp;somalica'', but may be a little narrower.<ref name=GR436/> Relative to the two other Malagasy ''Neoromicia'' species, the [[tibia]] is short. A single [[baculum]] (penis bone), 2.2&nbsp;mm long, has been studied. It resembles the baculum of ''N.&nbsp;melckorum'', but is smaller. As in ''N.&nbsp;matroka'', the distal (far) end is flat and displaced downwards, but the ''N.&nbsp;malagasyensis'' baculum has a smaller area and less well-developed flanges at the sides and a smaller vertical extension of the bone.<ref name=Bea315/>

The skull is somewhat smaller than that of ''N.&nbsp;matroka''<ref name=Bea315/> and the [[braincase]] and [[palate]] are narrower.<ref name=Bea321/> Compared to ''N.&nbsp;somalica'', the skull is broader.<ref name=Pea101>Peterson et al., 1995, p.&nbsp;101</ref> The ridge on the [[lacrimal bone]] is better developed, the palate is broader, the [[frontal bone]]s contain a depression and are swollen at the sides, the [[mastoid bone]]s are smaller,<ref name=GR436/> and the [[coronoid process of the mandible|coronoid]] and [[angular process]]es of the [[mandible]] (lower jaw) are more prominent.<ref name=GR438>Goodman and Ranivo, 2004, p.&nbsp;438</ref>

The [[animal echolocation|echolocation]] call of this species was reported in a 2007 study that  consists of a component with rapidly falling frequency followed by one with more slowly changing frequency.<ref>Kofoky et al., 2009, p.&nbsp;382, fig.&nbsp;7a</ref> The call takes 3.6 to 6.3&nbsp;ms, averaging 4.9&nbsp;ms, and the period between two calls is 34.2 to 94.4&nbsp;ms, averaging 69.1&nbsp;ms. The maximum frequency averages 79.8&nbsp;kHz, the minimum frequency averages 40.5&nbsp;kHz, and the call emits the most energy at a frequency of 45.7&nbsp;kHz.<ref>Kofoky et al., 2009, table&nbsp;1</ref>

==Distribution and ecology==
''Neoromicia malagasyensis'' is known only from the vicinity of [[Isalo National Park]], an area of about 2000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (800&nbsp;sq mi), in interior southwestern Madagascar.<ref name=iucn/> The [[holotype]] was caught in 1967 in a [[mistnet]] set in a row of palms along a river in dry savannah habitat.<ref>Peterson et al., 1995, pp.&nbsp;100, 102; Bates et al., 2006, p.&nbsp;315</ref> Peterson and colleagues reported that it had been collected near the village of [[Marinday]],<ref name=Pea100/> but Goodman and Ranivo suggested that it may instead have come from near [[Ilakaka]].<ref name=GR435/> Two specimens, a male and a female, were collected at different localities in Isalo National Park in early December 2002, both in mistnets near rivers. The male had enlarged [[testicle|testes]] and the female had recently stopped [[lactation|lactating]] and had large [[mammae]].<ref name=GR435/> Two others followed in 2003, also from the national park, and caught in woodland near rivers.<ref>Bates et al., 2006, pp.&nbsp;313, 315</ref> A 2009 study on echolocation described the call of six individuals of ''N.&nbsp;malagasyensis'' from an unspecified site within the national park.<ref>Kofoky et al., 2009, p.&nbsp;382</ref> In view of its small known range and the threat of [[habitat destruction]], the [[IUCN Red List]] assesses the species as "[[Endangered species|Endangered]]"; further research is recommended on its roosting and dietary habits.<ref name=iucn/>
