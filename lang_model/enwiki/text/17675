'''Grigore T. Popa''' (May 1, 1892&mdash;July 18, 1948) was a [[Romania]]n physician. Of lowly peasant origin, he managed to obtain a university education and become a professor at two of his country's leading universities. An anatomist by specialty, his research was valued abroad, while at home he helped train a generation of leading doctors. Ill-treated by successive fascist and communist dictatorships for his democratic ideals, the latter drove him out of his teaching position and he soon died in middle age. Upon the restoration of democracy, his alma mater and the school where he taught for much of his career was [[Grigore T. Popa University of Medicine and Pharmacy|named in his honor]].

==Biography==
===Origins and early career===
Born in [[D<U+0103>ne<U+0219>ti, Vaslui|<U+0218>ur<U+0103>ne<U+0219>ti]], [[Vaslui County]], his parents Maria and Toader were poor ''r<U+0103>ze<U+0219>i'', peasants who owned their own plot of land. His mother noticed his intellectual aptitude early on and, despite great material difficulties, including selling off their land so he could finish high school, his parents managed to provide him with an education. He graduated from the [[National College (Ia<U+0219>i)|National College]] in [[Ia<U+0219>i]] and entered the Natural Sciences faculty of [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University|the local university]]. However, as his parents had no more money for his schooling and there were no scholarships left, he switched to the Medical faculty, where there was one scholarship, even though the field did not attract him.<ref>Petrovanu, p.19</ref>

Upon seeing cadavers being dissected for the first time, he fainted and had to be revived with cold water by an assistant. However, he persevered in his studies and was helped in particular by two professors, [[Nicolae Hortolomei]] and [[Francisc Rainer]], becoming the latter's assistant after graduation.<ref name="p20"/> During [[World War I]], he took care of the wounded and sick at Ia<U+0219>i's [[Sf<U+00E2>ntul Spiridon Hospital]], earning him a knighthood in the [[Order of the Crown (Romania)|Order of the Crown]].<ref name="igna371"/> In 1918, at the conclusion of World War I, he married Florica Cern<U+0103>tescu, a university classmate and his closest scientific collaborator. The couple had two sons and two daughters.<ref name="igna371">Petrescu, p.372</ref> He followed Rainer to [[Bucharest]] in 1920, and in 1928, became professor of anatomy at Ia<U+0219>i.<ref name="p20"/> In addition, for many years he taught Histology, Anatomical Pathology and Legal Medicine, as required.<ref name="p22"/>

He received a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] fellowship in 1925, spending the first year in Chicago, the second at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts|Woods Hole]] and finishing by studying Anatomy and Embryology in 1927-1928 at [[University College London]] under [[Grafton Elliot Smith]].<ref name="p20">Petrovanu, p.20</ref> His scientific activity focused on three areas: the [[hypothalamic<U+2013>pituitary<U+2013>adrenal axis]], the [[dura mater]] and the reform of medical education at the university level.<ref name="p21">Petrovanu, p.21</ref> Regarding the first area, he worked in [[London]] alongside the [[Australia]]n [[Una Fielding]]; together they discovered the vascular link between the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, publishing their findings on the [[hypophyseal portal system]] in medical journals between 1930 and 1935, presenting them before the [[Royal Medical Society]] in 1935.<ref name="p21"/><ref>Sally O'Neill, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/fielding-una-lucy-10178 Fielding, Una Lucy (1888<U+2013>1969)], Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, 1996</ref> An admirer of the British educational model, he was a [[research fellow]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] for four to six months a year in 1927-1930, 1932 and 1935-1938.<ref name="p20"/>

===Later years and legacy===
Popa was dean of the Ia<U+0219>i medical faculty for two years, from 1938 to 1940.<ref name="p22"/> Over the course of his career, his students included [[George Emil Palade]] and some twenty-two university professors and [[Romanian Academy]] members.<ref name="p23"/> In 1936, together with [[Mihail Sadoveanu]], [[George Top<U+00EE>rceanu]] and [[Mihai Codreanu]], he founded ''<U+00CE>nsemn<U+0103>ri ie<U+0219>ene'' ("Recordings from Ia<U+0219>i"), a magazine that ran for four years.<ref name="p22">Petrovanu, p.22</ref> The same year, he became a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy.<ref name="p21"/><ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.acad.ro/bdar/armembriLit.php?vidT=P Membrii Academiei Rom<U+00E2>ne din 1866 p<U+00E2>n<U+0103> <U+00EE>n prezent] at the Romanian Academy site</ref>

Although active in civil society, he was never a member of a political party, rejected the politicization of university education, opposed racial or religious discrimination while upholding freedom of expression. Harassed by the [[Iron Guard]], he also signed, together with other prominent intellectuals, a petition asking dictator [[Ion Antonescu]] to end Romania's participation in [[World War II]] alongside [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name="p22"/> In 1942, following Rainer's death, he was transferred to Bucharest's [[Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy]], where he worked as a professor for four years and also served as dean.<ref>Petrovanu, p.22-3</ref>

With the onset of the [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]] and the installation of a [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party]]-led government, he continued to stand up for his ideals,<ref name="p23"/> which stunned members of the [[Petru Groza]] cabinet, in particular [[Ministry of National Education (Romania)|Education Minister]] [[<U+0218>tefan Voitec]]. For instance, at a conference in 1945, he praised the British and American university systems, drawing a vehement letter of rebuke from [[Constantin Ion Parhon]], who considered the Soviet model as optimal. He then took the even more drastic step of resigning from the [[Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union]].<ref name="igna370">Petrescu, p.370</ref> This oppositional stance led to his removal from the Academy with the enthusiastic approval of fellow scientists [[Traian S<U+0103>vulescu]] and Parhon,<ref name="igna371">Petrescu, p.371</ref> from the deanship and, in 1946, from teaching. Although seriously ill, he was refused hospitalization. Abandoned by his colleagues and under pressure from the authorities, he withdrew into semi-clandestinity.<ref name="p23"/> As he was targeted by the [[Securitate]] secret police, Popa's family decided to hide him at various friends' houses. By constantly changing addresses and not venturing out into the street, he managed to avoid arrest and was finally brought home, moribund, at the beginning of July 1948.<ref name="igna371"/> His death soon afterwards came several months after a [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]] was established; the Bucharest university leadership refused to have his coffin publicly displayed.<ref name="p23">Petrovanu, p.23</ref>

In 1991, following the [[Romanian Revolution]], the Ia<U+0219>i medical institute, which had meanwhile been separated from the main university, was renamed the [[Grigore T. Popa University of Medicine and Pharmacy]].<ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.primaria-iasi.ro/content.aspx?item=1668&lang=RO Universitatea de Medicin<U+01CE> <U+0219>i Farmacie "Grigore T.
