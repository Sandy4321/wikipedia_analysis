'''Tara Teng''' (born August 16, 1988) ([[Chinese name]]: '''Oi Kwan''') is a Canadian [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]], [[beauty pageant]] winner, and professional public speaker. She grew up on [[British Columbia]]'s [[Sunshine Coast (British Columbia)|Sunshine Coast]]. She has a [[Bachelor of Education]] degree from [[Trinity Western University]]. She attends Re:Generation, a [[Canadian National Baptist Convention]] church that was [[Church planting|planted]] by her father. Teng was named [[Miss BC World]] in 2010, [[Miss Canada]] in 2011, and [[Miss World Canada]] in 2012, despite withdrawing from the corresponding [[swimsuit competition]]s. She represented Canada at [[Miss World 2012]] in [[Ordos City]], China, and the Chinese government added her name to its [[List of blacklisted keywords in China|blacklist of keywords]] because she spoke publicly about [[human rights]] issues and Jesus during the competition.

Teng works full-time as an independent activist against [[human trafficking]], partnering with various organizations rather than working for one in particular. The film ''[[Bangkok Girl]]'' inspired Teng to begin opposing human trafficking. Teng uses various [[social media]] to raise awareness about human trafficking, including a personal [[blog]], [[Twitter]], and [[Facebook]]. In 2010, she used her position as Miss BC World to meet with Canada's Prime Minister, [[Stephen Harper]], to discuss a national plan for combatting human trafficking. She has participated in awareness initiatives, including [[Buying Sex is Not a Sport]], [[Freedom Week]], and [[Ignite the Road to Justice]]. She calls for Canada to adopt a law to make purchasing sex illegal in the same way as Sweden's ''[[Prostitution in Sweden#The_Kvinnofrid_law_.281999.29|Sex Purchase Act]]'', which she said "has a proven success rate for protecting women in prostitution and decreasing human trafficking."<ref name=Bulletin/>

Teng has called attention to human trafficking incidents relating to [[cocoa production in Ivory Coast]], the [[textile industry]] in [[Asia]], and [[sex trafficking in Eastern Europe]], [[Latin America]], and Asia. She helped convince [[Louie Giglio]] to make human trafficking a primary focus of the 2010 [[Passion Conferences|Passion Conference]]. She founded Undies for Africa, a charitable organization that sends panties and brassieres to Zambia. She also founded Send Love, a campaign to connect India's [[Dalit]] children with children in North America. In October 2012, the [[Joy Smith]] Foundation awarded Teng the International Freedom Award in recognition of her [[human rights defender|defence of human rights]]. The following month, she was one of thirty [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Langley]] residents to receive the [[Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal]].

Teng's mother Lori is a businessperson<ref name=New/> and her father Terry is a pastor. At one of the churches where Terry pastored, Teng had a negative experience with people there when she was 15 years old. She has said she reacted to the situation by rejecting Christianity and by making selfish decisions about her apartment, car, job, and boyfriend.<ref name=Converge/> Five years later, she began to feel that her life lacked purpose;<ref name=Circle/> she left her job, became dissatisfied with her boyfriend and broke up with him, and found it difficult to pay for her car. She said that these difficulties made her realize that things work out poorly when she makes her own plans for her life, so she decided to live according to what she believed to be God's plan from then onwards.<ref name=Converge/> She said that she could almost hear the [[voice of God]] telling her what she was learning.<ref name=Circle>{{Cite AV media|title=Tara Teng|publisher=[[100 Huntley Street]]|author=Ann Mainse|url=http://www2.crossroads.ca/fullcircle/player?vidID=22677|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}</ref> She later wrote on her blog that, before this experience, she had only been a Christian in theory, but thenceforward was a Christian in action.<ref name=Converge/> She said that, despite having grown up attending a church, she "didn't really... meet the person of Jesus Christ until" 2009.<ref name=Onnuri/>

Teng believes that it is [[Will of God|God's will]] for her to work in opposition to human trafficking, and specifically that she raise awareness about [[human trafficking in Canada]].

Teng first considered trying out for [[beauty pageant]]s when she was a university student; she mentioned an article about the [[Miss BC World]] competition to a friend, who encouraged her to enter.

[[File:Miss Canada Tara Teng.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A photograph of a group of women wearing dresses, the woman in the centre wearing a red dress and a white sash reading "MISS CANADA"|Tara Teng was crowned [[Miss Canada]] 2011 after having withdrawn from another pageant that included a [[Swimsuit competition|bikini competition]].]]
After winning the Miss BC World competition, Teng planned to compete in another pageant, but withdrew after discovering that it focused on body image and included a bikini competition. She said that she did not "want something like the bikini swimwear contest to water down [her] message" about human trafficking. Within days of her withdrawal, the host of the [[Miss Canada]] competition added Teng on [[Facebook]] and asked her to compete for the Miss Canada title.<ref name=Mars/> Teng agreed to participate.<ref name=Groove/> At the opening dinner for the contestants, Teng made a speech, saying that human trafficking is something that she has been fighting against for a long time, that she did not choose it simply as a beauty pageant platform, and that the judges should not pick her if they did not like her stance on the subject, because she would not change it for the sake of winning a pageant.<ref name=Groove/>

She found that being Miss Canada gave her new opportunities to raise human trafficking awareness.<ref name=Groove/>

Soon after being crowned, Teng was featured on several Iranian websites, which displayed a photograph of her in a veil covering her hair. These websites praised Teng for being modest in her dress and more concerned with "inner beauty" than physical attractiveness. The website ''Kodoom'' said that Teng sometimes wears dresses with low necklines and that, while she may occasionally wear a veil, she does not wear a [[hijab]].<ref name=Kodoom>{{Cite journal|journal=Kodoom|title=Miss Canada 2011 veiled in Iranian media|date=February 19, 2011|url=http://features.kodoom.com/en/entertainment/miss-canada-2011-veiled-in-iranian-media/v/2564/|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref> In June 2011, in her capacity as Miss Canada, she was the marshal for the Community Day parade in Langley.<ref name=Voyage>{{Cite journal|journal=Langley Advance|title=Voyage for justice|author=Heather Colpitts|date=June 16, 2011|url=http://www.langleyadvance.com/news/Voyage+justice/4956747/story.html|accessdate=April 9, 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110623064748/http://www.langleyadvance.com/news/Voyage+justice/4956747/story.html|archivedate=June 23, 2011}}</ref> Joy Smith said that, "as Miss Canada, [Teng] has been such a strong voice among her generation and all Canadians for the abolition of human trafficking."<ref name=University/> Teng's reign as Miss Canada lasted until January 2012.<ref name=Gospel/> At the 2012 Miss Canada pageant, Teng spent some time with [[Jaclyn Miles]], who won that year's competition.

===Inspirations===
Teng first learned about the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and the [[Underground Railroad]] when she was 10 years old.<ref name=Hope/> As a child, she read ''Let the Little Children Come'' by [[Amy Carmichael]], who had sought to end the [[prostitution of children]] in India. The book is about [[devadasi]]s, young girls in India given to priests as brides.<ref name=Stirk/> The film ''[[Bangkok Girl]]'' inspired Teng to begin opposing human trafficking.<ref name=Kamloops/> She continued to encounter documentaries and articles about human trafficking throughout her teenage years, and eventually began to seek out these materials.<ref name=Hope/>

In 2006, Teng discovered that someone in her neighbourhood was a human trafficking victim.<ref name=Langley/> This victim was 14 years old when she was trafficked<ref name=Recorder/> by someone posing as a boyfriend. The girl's mother,<ref name=London/> a friend of Teng's,<ref name=CJOB>{{Cite journal|journal=[[CJOB]]|title=Miss Canada and Kildonan MP Joy Smith team up to fight human trafficking|date=August 23, 2011}}</ref> lived on the same street as Teng.<ref name=London/> She also learned that she had friends whose sisters and cousins had been trafficked.<ref name=London/> Teng was also inspired to oppose human trafficking by historical figures such as [[Harriet Tubman]], who brought slaves to freedom in Canada at the risk of her own life; [[Nellie McClung]], who was successful in achieving [[Women%27s_suffrage#Canada|women's suffrage in Canada]];<ref name=Heroes/> [[William Wilberforce]], an 18th-to-19th-century member of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] who, three days before he died, abolished slavery in the [[British Empire]];<ref name=Converge/> and [[Malala Yousafzai]] of Pakistan.<ref name=Huntley/>

===Philosophy===
[[File:Abolish Slavery.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A photograph of a woman with brown eyes and brown hair looking at the viewer and holding a white sign reading "ABOLISH SLAVERY"|Tara Teng identifies herself as an [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] and says that the average age of [[human trafficking]] victims in Canada is 13.]]

Teng identifies herself as an [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]].<ref name=Langley/> She also considers herself a [[Feminism|feminist]], but uses the label "feminist" with reservation because she is concerned that it will make people think that she is a [[Misandry|misandrist]].<ref name=Heroes/> She calls herself a feminist because she believes that the most common human rights violations are those of [[women's rights]].<ref name=Heroes>{{Cite journal|journal=[[The Vancouver Sun]]|author=Denise Ryan|date=March 3, 2011|title=B.C.

In 2010, Teng said that 80% of human trafficking victims were female, and 50% were children.<ref name=Queen>{{Cite journal|journal=ChristianWeek|title=Beauty queen targets human trafficking|author=Frank Stirk|date=September 10, 2010|url=http://www.christianweek.org/stories.php?id=1056|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}</ref> In 2011, she said that there were 27 million slaves around the world,<ref name=Peace/> together comprising a $32-billion-dollar industry,<ref name=Recorder/> "more than [[Google]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], and [[Starbucks]] combined."<ref name=Onnuri/> She said that the illegal drug trade is the only industry that generates a greater profit overall than human trafficking.<ref name=Canadian/> In 2012, she said that human trafficking was the world's fastest-growing crime.<ref name=Onnuri/> She also said that slavery had changed over the previous 200 years, but that its devastation remained the same, and that some trafficked [[Sexual slavery|sexual slaves]] are as young as 12 years old.<ref name=Times>{{Cite journal|journal=Langley Times|title=Crying freedom|author=Brenda Anderson|date=March 3, 2011|url=http://www.bclocalnews.com/news/117365283.html|accessdate=March 28, 2013}}</ref>

Teng placed the average age of victims in Canada at 13 and said that children in other countries are sold as young as age three.<ref name=London/> She said that the youngest human trafficking victim she has ever worked with was 18 months old.<ref name=Recorder/> She also advocates labelling human trafficking victims "not as prostitutes but prostituted [because nearly] 98% of the women don't want to be in the industry," which she argues is growing faster than any other industry in the world.<ref name=London/> Teng identified the root causes of human trafficking as being [[sexual objectification]], [[political corruption]], [[organized crime]], and [[poverty]].<ref name=Recorder/>

In response to people attempting to [[Prostitution law in Canada|legalize prostitution in Canada]], Teng said, "you're talking about an industry that capitalizes on racially oppressed women, on impoverished women, on minors, on children, it capitalizes on immigrants... I can<U+2019>t believe that we<U+2019>re having that conversation." Teng has also argued that, throughout history, the legalization of prostitution has never made life safer for prostitutes and will not do so in the future either.<ref name=Canadian/> Teng said that one of the biggest difficulties that needs to be overcome in addressing human trafficking is stereotypes of prostitutes; she said that she hates the term "hooker".<ref name=Innocence/> Teng uses various [[social media]] to raise awareness about human trafficking, including a personal [[blog]], [[Twitter]], and Facebook.<ref name=Hope/>
