The '''Euro Fly Flash Light''' (sometimes styled by the manufacturer as ''FLASHlight'') is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[ultralight aircraft]], designed and produced by [[Euro Fly Srl]], of [[Galliera Veneta]]. The aircraft is supplied as a kit for [[Homebuilt aircraft|amateur construction]] or as a complete ready-to-fly-aircraft.<ref name="WDLA11">Bayerl, Robby; Martin Berkemeier; et al: ''World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2011-12'', page 47. WDLA UK, Lancaster UK, 2011. ISSN 1368-485X</ref>

==Design and development==
The aircraft was designed to comply with the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration A<U+00E9>ronautique Internationale]] microlight rules. It features a [[strut-braced]] [[high-wing]], a two-seats-in-[[side-by-side configuration]] enclosed cockpit, fixed [[tricycle landing gear]] and a single engine in [[tractor configuration]].<ref name="WDLA11" />

The aircraft [[fuselage]] is made from welded steel tubing, with the wing made from [[aluminum]] tubing, all covered in heat-shrunk [[Dacron]] [[aircraft fabric]]. Its {{convert|8.5|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} span wing has an area of {{convert|13.5|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} and is supported by V-struts with [[jury strut]]s. The standard engine available is the {{convert|64|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 582]] [[two-stroke]], which gives a cruising speed of {{convert|130|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with the {{convert|80|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 912UL]] [[four-stroke]] powerplant optional, which gives a cruising speed of {{convert|160|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="WDLA11" />
