On May 23, 2013, at approximately 7:00 pm [[Pacific Time Zone|PDT]] (02:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] May 24), a section of the four-lane [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] bridge over the [[Skagit River]] collapsed, sending two cars into the water.<ref name="KINGTV">{{cite news |title= I-5 bridge collapses over Skagit River, no fatalities |agency=Associated Press  |publisher= [[KING-TV]] |location= Seattle |url= http://www.nwcn.com/news/washington/Report-I-5-bridge-collapses-over-Skagit-River-cars-in-water-208758631.html |date= May 23, 2013 |accessdate= May 23, 2013}}</ref>  The incident occurred in [[Burlington, Washington]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} north of [[Seattle, Washington]].<ref name="KINGTV" />

==Incident==
The collapse was apparently caused by a [[semi-trailer truck]] from Canada hauling an [[oversize load]] to [[Vancouver, Washington]], damaging the compression chord in the overhead steel frame ([[truss|trusswork]]) on the southbound side of the bridge<ref>Becky Monk. What caused the Skagit River bridge to collapse?  Puget Sound Business Journal,  May 24, 2013. [http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/2013/05/what-caused-the-skagit-river-bridge-to.html]</ref>. The vertical clearance from the roadway to the upper arched beam in the outer southbound lane is {{convert|14|ft|7|in|m}}, and all trucks with over-sized loads are expected to travel in the inside southbound lane where the clearance is around {{convert|17|ft|m}}. According to the ''Seattle Times'', William Scott was traveling with a {{convert|15|ft|9|in|m}} tall load, and after the collapse a "dented upper corner and a scrape along the upper side are visible on the 'oversize load' equipment casing being hauled on the truck."<ref>{{citation|author=Emily Heffter|title=Bridge collapse: Oversize-load permits easy to get online|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=May 24, 2013|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2021049700_bridgeliabilityxml.html}}</ref>

[[File:Woody_debris_jam_32088.JPG|right|thumb|The Riverside Bridge on South Burlington Boulevard (foreground) is the main alternative to the collapsed I-5 span (upper right background).]]

Traffic on I-5 was detoured around the scene of the collapse.<ref name="ST2021049359" />

== Washington's infrastructure ==
Prior to the bridge collapse the Seattle Section of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE) issued the 2013 Report Card for the State of Washington infrastructure. The state's bridges were given a grade of C-; there were 400 structurally deficient bridges in Washington, and 36% of all bridges exceeded their design life of 50 years.<ref>[http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/washington/washington-overview/ 2013 Report Card for Washington's Infrastructure]</ref>
