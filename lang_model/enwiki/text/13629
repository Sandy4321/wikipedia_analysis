The '''National Museum of Archaeology''' is a [[Malta|Maltese]] museum of prehistoric artifacts, located in [[Valletta]]. It is managed by [[Heritage Malta]].

==History==
The [[Auberge de Provence]] was opened as the National Museum in 1958 by [[Agatha Barbara]], then the Minister of Education. The museum originally included the archaeological collection on the ground floor and fine arts on the first floor. The first curator was Captain Charles G. Zammit, the son of the eminent Maltese archaeologist [[Themistocles Zammit|Sir Themistocles Zammit]].<ref>{{Citation |author=Sultana, S. |title=The National Museum of Archaeology |publisher=Heritage Books. |year=2006}}</ref>

In 1974, the fine arts collection was moved to the [[National Museum of Fine Arts (Malta)|National Museum of Fine Arts]], newly established in the Admiralty House building in South Street, Valletta, and the National Museum was renamed the National Museum for Archaeology.<ref>{{Citation |author=Heritage Malta Brochure |title=The National Museum of Archaeology: a brief guide |publisher= Midsea Books Ltd.}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.heritagemalta.org/museums/museums.html |author=Heritage Malta |title=Museums and Sites |publisher=Heritage Malta |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref>

The museum was refurbished and upgraded in 1998. Artifacts were placed in climate-controlled displays so that the exhibition met with current conservation standards.<ref>{{Citation |author=Sultana, S. |title=The National Museum of Archaeology |publisher=Heritage Books. |year=2006}}</ref>

==Building==
{{main|Auberge de Provence}}
The Auberge de Provence is a [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] building in Republic Street, Valletta, built for the [[Knights of Malta]] in 1571. It was probably designed by the Maltese architect Gerolamo Cassar, who directed the building of most important buildings in the early days of Valletta. The building<U+2019>s [[facade|fa<U+00E7>ade]] is imprinted with [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] characteristics usually associated with Cassar.<ref>{{Citation |author=Sultana, S. |title=The National Museum of Archaeology |publisher=Heritage Books. |year=2006}}</ref>

The Grand Salon on the first floor is the most ornate room in the building. The Knights used it for business discussions, and as a [[refectory]] and banqueting hall, where they sat at long tables according to seniority.<ref>{{Citation |author=Sultana, S. |title=The National Museum of Archaeology |publisher=Heritage Books. |year=2006}}</ref>

When [[Napoleon]] expelled the Knights from Malta in 1798 the Auberge was leased to the Malta Union Club. Though the lease was to expire in 2002, on 12 August 1955 the Auberge was assigned to house Malta<U+2019>s National Museum.<ref>{{Citation |author=Sultana, S. |title=The National Museum of Archaeology |publisher=Heritage Books. |year=2006}}</ref>

==Collection==
The ground floor of the museum exhibits [[prehistory|prehistoric]] artefacts from the Maltese islands, from the [[G<U+0127>ar Dalam phase]] (5200 BC), the earliest appearance of settlement on the island, up to the [[Tarxien phase]] (2500 BC).

==Early Neolithic Period Room (5200<U+2013>3800 BC)==

[[File:Photo Ellis Hal Salflieni.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The [[Hypogeum of <U+0126>al-Saflieni|<U+0126>al Saflieni Hypogeum]]]]
This room exhibits artifacts from the early [[neolithic|Neolithic Period]], including decorated pottery from the [[G<U+0127>ar Dalam phase|G<U+0127>ar Dalam]], [[Grey Skorba phase|Grey Skorba]], [[Red Skorba phase|Red Skorba]] and [[<U+017B>ebbu<U+0121> phase|<U+017B>ebbu<U+0121>]] phases.

Of particular importance are the Red Skorba figurines, the earliest local representations of the human figure and the predecessors of the statues of later temple periods.<ref>{{Citation |author=Heritage Malta Brochure |title=The National Museum of Archaeology: a brief guide |publisher= Midsea Books Ltd.}}</ref>

The exhibition features a reconstruction of the [[hypogeum|rock-cut tombs]] that were a characteristic of the early Neolithic period in Malta. Rock-cut tombs reached their climax in burials like the [[Hypogeum of <U+0126>al-Saflieni|<U+0126>al Saflieni Hypogeum]] and the [[Xag<U+0127>ra Stone Circle]];<ref>{{Citation |author=Trump, D. |title=Malta Prehistory and Temples |publisher=Midsea Books Ltd. |year=2002}}</ref> photographs of both sites are displayed in the museum.<ref>{{Citation |author=Heritage Malta Brochure |title=The National Museum of Archaeology: a brief guide |publisher= Midsea Books Ltd.}}</ref>

==Temple Period Rooms (3800<U+2013>2500 BC)==
[[File:Three fat ladies.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Corpulent figures from [[<U+0126>a<U+0121>ar Qim]] on display at the museum]]
These rooms show examples of architecture, human representation and other items that date from the [[M<U+0121>arr phase|M<U+0121>arr]], [[<U+0120>gantija phase|<U+0120>gantija]], [[Saflieni phase|Saflieni]] and [[Tarxien phase|Tarxien]] phases of Maltese prehistory. The temples that were built at this time are considered to be the world<U+2019>s first free standing monuments<ref>{{Citation |author=Sultana, S. |title=The National Museum of Archaeology |publisher=Heritage Books. |year=2006}}</ref> and are listed in the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]].

The museum exhibits numerous [[corpulent]] statues representing human bodies unearthed from temple excavations, along with [[phallic]] representations. Until recently the statues were called Mother Goddesses, Fat Ladies, Deities and Priests among other names, but it is now argued that these statues were probably asexual and represented a human being, irrespective of whether it was male or female.<ref>{{Citation |author=Sultana, S. |title=The National Museum of Archaeology |publisher=Heritage Books. |year=2006}}</ref> The representations vary in size and shape, with the largest being as tall as 2.7m and the smallest 4mm.

The discovery of temple [[altar]]s and corpulent human representations suggests that some type of [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] existed on the islands of Malta and [[Gozo]] in prehistory. Given the corpulency of the statues it may be that the cult was tied to a [[fertility rite]]. Fertility at this time must have been very important since, apart from family growth, it also meant the reproduction of crops and animals.<ref>{{Citation |author=Sultana, S. |title=The National Museum of Archaeology |publisher=Heritage Books. |year=2006}}</ref>

The exhibition includes altars excavated from the Tarxien Temples that were probably used for [[animal sacrifice]]s. They were brought to the museum for conservation reasons.

==Temporary exhibitions==
[[File:Bild-Ottavio Leoni, Caravaggio.jpg|thumb|150px|Paintings of the Italian artist [[Caravaggio|Michelangelo Caravaggio]] were exhibited in the Grand Salon, 2007]]

The Grand Salon on the second floor occasionally holds temporary exhibitions of particular national interest.

It has recently hosted the following exhibitions, among others:

*''Silent Warriors'' (March 2007), featuring artifacts from the [[terracotta army]] of the first emperor of [[China]], [[Shi Huangdi]].

*''Carravagio L<U+2019>Immagine Del Divino'' (September <U+2013> November 2007), exhibiting original masterpieces of the Italian artist, [[Carravagio|Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio]], who was active in Malta in the early 17th century.

*[[Renzo Piano|Renzo Piano<U+2019>s]] designs for the redevelopment of Valletta<U+2019>s [[City Gate (Malta)|City Gate]], House of Parliament and [[Opera House Valletta|Opera House]] (July 2009).

*''In Quest of Beauty'' (26 February <U+2013> 15 May 2011), an exhibition of works by the [[Bohemian]] [[Art Nouveau]] artist [[Alphonse Mucha]].

==Plans==
The museum plans to open the first floor galleries and expand the exhibition in the near future to include archaeological artifacts from the Bronze Age, Phoenician, Punic and Roman Periods.<ref>{{Citation |author=Heritage Malta Brochure |title=The National Museum of Archaeology: a brief guide |publisher= Midsea Books Ltd.}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |author=Trump, D. |title=Malta Prehistory and Temples |publisher=Midsea Books Ltd. |year=2002}}</ref>
