'''Gulfton''' is a community including a {{convert|3.2|sqmi|km2|1|abbr=on}} group of apartment complexes with a mostly Hispanic and immigrant population in southwestern [[Houston]], [[Texas]], United States.<ref>"[http://www.gswhcc.org/custom2.asp?pageid=137 WELCOME TO SOUTHWEST HOUSTON!]." ''Greater Southwest Houston Chamber of Commerce''.

Gulfton was developed in the 1960s and 1970s, in the midst of an oil boom, with new apartment complexes geared towards young singles from the Northeast and Midwest United States.  In the 1980s, the economy declined and the community became home to newly-arrived immigrants.<ref name="USDOJTruancySuccess">"[http://ojjdp.ncjrs.org/truancy/success_1.html Success Stories]." ''Office of Juvenile and Delinquency Prevention''. ''[[United States Department of Justice]]''. Retrieved on April 5, 2008.</ref>  Beginning in the 1980s, Gulfton developed higher crime rates and increasingly overwhelmed schools, and Houstonians nicknamed the community the "Gulfton Ghetto." The city responded to the sudden changes in Gulfton by increasing its police presence while the school district opened more schools to handle the sudden influx of children. 

By 2000, Gulfton consisted of 71% Hispanic residents, including many recent immigrants from [[Mexico]], and is the densest neighborhood in Houston.  After its transition, Gulfton gained a community college campus, added public bus routes, a park and community center, a public library, a juvenile detention facility, and aspects of Latin American culture and recreation.<!--This refers to the culture section-->

In the 1980s the economy declined and thousands of renters left, causing a rise in vacancies. Many apartments throughout Houston experienced bankruptcy, foreclosure, and constant changes in ownership.<ref name="Drugsneglectslums"/> For instance, Colonial House Apartments, which became known throughout the Houston area for advertisements featuring California promoter Michael Pollack, faced foreclosure and DRG Funding took over the complex.<ref name="BivinsAuctioned">Bivins, Ralph.

Apartment complex owners noticed that many immigrants from countries such as Mexico, [[El Salvador]], and [[Vietnam]] wished to settle in Houston, so the owners abandoned previous ''adults only'' policies that barred children from living in the complexes, listed vacancies in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and reduced rents.<ref name="SusanRogersSN27"/> A July 17, 1988, ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' article stated that rent rates were about the same at poorly-maintained apartments in Gulfton and other Houston areas as the rates at well-maintained apartments in other areas in Houston.<ref name="Drugsneglectslums"/> In that article, Gaines said that the complexes in Gulfton began to cater to illegal aliens. Gaines explained that many complexes allowed for renters to "double-up" housing, where multiple individuals and/or families share the same unit; the complex owners did not pay attention as long as the rent payments were made. Landlords, including those who did not perform standard background checks, found difficulty in filling apartment complexes. Many banks and other lending institutions owned foreclosed apartments and did not properly maintain them as they did not seem to desire, "pouring money down a perceived rat hole." Gaines added that many complexes deferred maintenance. John Goodner, a Houston city council member representing a district covering Gulfton at that time, said that more changes occurred in his district in the several years leading up to 1988 than in any other area in Houston; Goodner lobbied for services, such as a satellite health department clinic, for apartment renters.<ref name="Drugsneglectslums"/>

Many of the new Gulfton residents found that they did not have easy access to government services for low income residents such as [[food stamp]]s and municipal and county health care. In July 1989, members of the Houston Resident Citizens Participation Council, a citizen commission that monitored funding for low income residents, did not like seeing funds diverted from the "old poor" to the "new poor"; by then the Gulfton area was designated by Houston's city council as a "Community Development Target." The HRCPC members said that the original "Community Development Targets" were not fully served before the service areas expanded and the budget was decreased. Rose Mary Garza, then the principal of Cunningham Elementary School, said that some government officials felt reluctant to expand services to Gulfton because they believed that the low income apartments would be bulldozed.<ref name="Newpoor">Cobb, Kim.

In 1985, recent Salvadoran immigrants opened the Central American Refugee Center (CARECEN) to provide legal services for Central American immigrants.

GARC advocated for assisting Gulfton residents and established programs to assist them. Taafe and Fisher said that GARC focused on relieving the symptoms of poverty to the point that it did not focus on removing the causes of poverty.<ref>Fisher, Robert and Lisa Taafe. "Public Life in Gulfton: Multiple Publics and Models of Organization." ''Community Practice: Models in Action''. 42-43.</ref> After Goodner, described as "conservative" by Fisher and Taafe, organized a March 3, 1989, town hall meeting, an organization called the Gulfton Area Action Council (GAAC) opened.

In the late 1980s, the Southwest Houston Task Force, a coalition of members of the City of Houston government, members of health and human services organizations, businesses, schools, religious organizations, and Gulfton-area residents opened after two initial meetings between City of Houston representatives and community groups related to a proposal to establish a municipal health clinic in Gulfton.<ref name="PublicLifeGulfton44">Fisher, Robert and Lisa Taafe.

The clinic, jointly operated by the task force and the City of Houston, provided pre-natal care and child care. Fisher and Taafe said that the organization "lost its focal issue." After performing a "community needs assessment" and identifying "local leaders", the organization ended in early 1992.<ref>Fisher, Robert and Lisa Taafe.

Around 1:40 A.M. on July 11, 1998, [[Houston Police Department]] officers acting on a tip about drug dealing entered a Gulfton apartment complex and shot and killed Pedro Oregon Navarro; the circumstances of the event were disputed. On October 19 of that year, a Harris County grand jury did not indict the officers on charges related to the incident. Nestor Rodriguez, a professor of sociology at the [[University of Houston]], described Gulfton as "a place where people are just struggling to get by."
