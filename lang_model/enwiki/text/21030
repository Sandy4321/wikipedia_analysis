'''''The Crab with the Golden Claws''''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|'''Le Crabe aux pinces d'or'''}}) is the ninth volume of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', the comics series by Belgian cartoonist [[Herg<U+00E9>]]. Commissioned by the Belgian newspaper {{lang|fr|''[[Le Soir]]''}} for its children's supplement {{lang|fr|''Soir-Jeunesse''}}, it was serialised from October 1940 to October 1941 during the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II]]. The story tells of young Belgian reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and his dog [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]], who travel to [[Morocco]] to pursue a gang of international opium smugglers.

''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' was published in book form shortly after its conclusion. Herg<U+00E9> continued ''The Adventures of Tintin'' with ''[[The Shooting Star]]'', while the series itself became a defining part of the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian comics tradition]].  In 1943, Herg<U+00E9> coloured and redrew the book in his distinctive ''{{lang|fr|[[Ligne claire|ligne-claire]]}}'' style for [[Casterman]]'s republication.  ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' introduces the recurring character [[Captain Haddock]], who became a major fixture of the series. The book is the first ''Tintin'' adventure published in the United States and the first to be adapted into a motion picture. ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' was adapted for the 1956 [[Belvision Studios]] animation ''[[Herg<U+00E9>'s Adventures of Tintin]]'', for the 1991 [[Ellipse Programm<U+00E9>|Ellipse]]/[[Nelvana]] animated series ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (TV series)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'', and for the 2011 [[The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn|film]] directed by [[Steven Spielberg]].

==Synopsis==
Tintin is informed by [[Thomson and Thompson]] of a case involving the ramblings of a drunken man, later killed, found with a scrap of paper from what appears to be a tin of [[crab meat]] with the word "Karaboudjan" scrawled on it. His subsequent investigation and the kidnapping of a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] man interested in giving him a letter leads Tintin to a ship called the ''Karaboudjan'', where he is abducted by a syndicate of criminals who have hidden [[opium]] in the crab tins. Tintin escapes from his locked room after Snowy chews through his bonds and Tintin knocks out a man sent to bring him food, leaving the man bound and gagged in the room. Tintin encounters [[Captain Haddock]], an alcoholic sea captain, who is manipulated by his first mate, [[Allan Thompson (comics)|Allan]], and is unaware of his crew's criminal activities. Tintin hides in the locker under the bed and defeats [[Jumbo (Tintin comics)|Jumbo]], the sailor left in the cabin, while Allan thinks Tintin has climbed out of the porthole back into the storeroom. He blows open the storeroom door, then finding it empty goes back to the Captain's room, where he finds Jumbo tied to a chair and gagged. Escaping the ship in a lifeboat after sending a radio message to the police about the cargo, a seaplane tries to attack them. Tintin and the Captain hijack the plane, tie up the pilots, and try to reach Spain. Haddock's drunken behaviour in a storm causes them to crash-land in the [[Sahara]], where the crew escapes.{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|1943|pp=1<U+2013>28}}

After trekking across the desert and nearly dying of dehydration, Tintin and Haddock are rescued and taken to a [[French North Africa|French outpost]], where they hear on the radio the storm sunk the ''Karaboudjan''. They travel to a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] port, and along the way are attacked by [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] tribesmen, defending themselves with French [[MAS-36 rifle]]s. At the port, members of his old crew kidnap the Captain after he recognises their disguised ''Karaboudjan''. Tintin meets Thomson and Thompson who got his message, and they learn that the wealthy merchant [[Omar ben Salaad]] sold the crab tins; Tintin tells Thomson and Thompson to discreetly investigate. Tintin tracks down the gang and saves the Captain, but they both become intoxicated by the fumes from wine barrels breached in a shootout with the villains. Haddock chases a gang-member from the cellar to an entrance behind a bookcase in Salaad's house. Upon sobering up, Tintin discovers a necklace of a crab with golden claws on the now-subdued owner of the wine cellar, Omar ben Salaad, and realizes that he is the leader of the drug cartel. Allan steals a boat and tries escaping, but Tintin captures him. The police arrest the gang and free the Japanese man, who introduces himself as [[Bunji Kuraki]], a police detective who was trying to warn Tintin of the group he was up against. He had been investigating the sailor on Haddock's crew who drowned; the sailor was on the verge of bringing him opium before he was eliminated. Turning on the radio, Tintin learns that, thanks to him, the entire organisation of the Crab with the Golden Claws is behind bars.{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|1943|pp=29<U+2013>62}}

==History==

===Background===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="It is certain that [[Raymond de Becker]] [editor of {{lang|fr|''[[Le Soir]]''}}] sympathized with the [[Nazism|National Socialist]] system&nbsp;... I admit that I believed myself that the future of the West could depend on the [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order]]. For many people democracy had proven deceptive, and the New Order brought fresh hope. In Catholic circles such views were widely held. Given everything that happened, it was naturally a terrible error to have believed even for an instant in the New Order."|source=Herg<U+00E9>, 1973{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=117<U+2013>118}} }}
As the [[Battle of Belgium|Belgian army clashed with the invading Germans]] in May 1940, Herg<U+00E9> and his wife fled by car to France along with tens of thousands of other Belgians, first staying in [[Paris]] and then heading south to [[Puy-de-D<U+00F4>me]], where they remained for six weeks.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=66|2a1=Goddin|2y=2009|2p=69|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3pp=111<U+2013>112}} On 28 May, Belgian [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III]] officially surrendered the country to the German army to prevent further killing; a move that Herg<U+00E9> agreed with. [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|Germany placed Belgium under occupation]]. Herg<U+00E9> followed the king's request that all civilians who had fled the country return; he arrived back in Brussels on 30 June.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=67|2a1=Goddin|2y=2009|2p=70|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3pp=112<U+2013>113}} There, he found that an officer of the German army's [[Propagandastaffel]] occupied his house, and he also faced financial trouble, as he owed back taxes yet was unable to access his financial reserves (his fee due from Casterman eventually arrived).{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=113<U+2013>114}} All Belgian publications were now under the control of the German occupying force. The [[Catholic]] publication {{lang|fr|''Le Vingti<U+00E8>me Si<U+00E8>cle''}} and its supplement {{lang|fr|''Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me''}}, where Herg<U+00E9> had always worked serialising ''Tintin'', no longer had permission to continue publication. ''[[Land of Black Gold]]'', the story that Herg<U+00E9> had been working on there, would have to be abandoned part-way through.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=68<U+2013>69|2a1=Goddin|2y=2009|2p=70|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=114}} [[Victor Matthys]], the Rexist editor of {{lang|fr|''[[Le Pays R<U+00E9>el]]''}}, offered Herg<U+00E9> employment as a cartoonist, but Herg<U+00E9> perceived {{lang|fr|''Le Pays R<U+00E9>el''}} as an explicitly political publication and thus declined the position.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=114<U+2013>115}} 

Instead, he accepted a position with {{lang|fr|''[[Le Soir]]''}}, Belgian's largest Francophone daily newspaper. Confiscated from its original owners, the German authorities permitted ''Le Soir'' to reopen under the directorship of Belgian editor [[Raymond de Becker]], although it remained firmly under Nazi control, supporting the German war effort and espousing [[antisemitism|anti-Semitism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=70<U+2013>71|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=116<U+2013>118}}{{efn|{{lang|fr|''Le Soir''}} published during the occupation was known by Belgians as {{lang|fr|''Le Soir vol<U+00E9>''}} (''The Stolen Soir'') as it was published without the approval of its original owners, who resumed publication after the war.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=70|2a1=Slater|2y=2012}} }} After joining the ''Le Soir'' team on 15 October, Herg<U+00E9> created its new children's supplement, ''Soir-Jeunesse''. Appointed editor of this supplement, he was aided by old friend Paul Jamin and the cartoonist [[Jacques Van Melkebeke]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=72|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=120<U+2013>121}} The first issue of ''Soir-Jeunesse'' was published with a large announcement across the cover: "Tintin et Milou sont revenus!" ("Tintin and Snowy are Back!").{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=92|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=72|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=121}} Some Belgians were upset that Herg<U+00E9> was willing to work for a newspaper controlled by the occupying Nazi administration; he received an anonymous letter from "the father of a large family" asking him not to work for ''Le Soir'', fearing that ''The Adventures of Tintin'' would now be used to indoctrinate children in Nazi ideology, and that as a result "They will no longer speak of God, of the Christian family, of the Catholic ideal&nbsp;... [How] can you agree to collaborate in this terrible act, a real sin against Spirit?"{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2009|1p=73|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=72}} Herg<U+00E9> however was heavily enticed by the size of ''Le Soir'''s readership, which reached 600,000, far more than what ''Le Vingti<U+00E8>me Si<U+00E8>cle'' had been able to accomplish.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=73|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|p=121}} Faced with the reality of Nazi oversight, Herg<U+00E9> abandoned the overt political themes that had pervaded much of his earlier work, instead adopting a policy of neutrality.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=99|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=95}} Without the need to satirise political types, [[Harry Thompson]] observed that "Herg<U+00E9> was now concentrating more on plot and on developing a new style of character comedy. The public reacted positively."{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=99}}

===Publication===
[[File:Le Soir vol<U+00E9>.jpg|thumb|200px|left|alt=Photograph of the front page of newspaper showing signs of being many decades old|A 1943 copy of {{lang|fr|''Le Soir''}} dating to the occupation]]

''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' began serialisation in ''Soir-Jeunesse'' on 17 October 1940.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=45}}
However, on 8 May 1941, a paper shortage caused by the ongoing war led to the ''Soir-Jeunesse'' being reduced to four pages, with the length of the weekly Tintin strip being cut by two-thirds. Several weeks later, on 3 September 1941, the supplement disappeared altogether, with ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' being moved into ''Le Soir'' itself in September, where it became a daily strip. As a result, Herg<U+00E9> was forced to alter the pace at which his narrative moved, as he had to hold the reader's attention at the end of every line.{{sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=1989|1p=66|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2p=102|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3p=45|4a1=Assouline|4y=2009|4p=78|5a1=Peeters|5y=2012|5p=125}} As with earlier ''Adventures of Tintin'', the story was later serialised in France in the Catholic newspaper ''[[C<U+0153>urs Vaillants]]'' from 21 June 1942.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=45}}

Following serialisation, [[Casterman]] collected together and published the story in book form in 1941; the last black-and-white ''Tintin'' volume to be released. For this collected edition, Herg<U+00E9> thought of renaming the story, initially considering ''The Red Crab'' (to accompany earlier adventures ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'' and ''[[The Black Island]]'') before re-settling on {{lang|fr|''Le Crabe aux pinces d'or''}} (''The Crab with the Golden Claws'').{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=95|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=45|3a1=Assouline|3y=2009|3p=79}} Herg<U+00E9> became annoyed that Casterman then sent the book to the printers without his final approval.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=126}} Nevertheless, as a result of ''Le Soir'''s publicity, book sales markedly increased, to the extent that most of the prior ''Adventures of Tintin'' were reprinted as a result.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=79|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=126}} German authorities made two exceptions: No reprinting of ''[[Tintin in America]]'' or ''The Black Island'' because they were set in the United States and Britain respectively, both of which were in conflict with Germany.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=98}}

The serial introduced the character of [[Captain Haddock]]. Haddock made his first appearance in ''Le Soir'' adjacent to an advert for the anti-Semitic German film, ''[[Jud S<U+00FC><U+00DF> (1940 film)|Jud S<U+00FC><U+00DF>]]''.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=124}} Herg<U+00E9> chose the name "Haddock" for the character after his wife, [[Germaine Kieckens|Germaine Remi]], mentioned "a sad English fish" during a meal.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=100|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=74}} The inclusion of the Japanese police detective [[Bunji Kuraki]] as an ally of Tintin's in this story was probably designed to counterbalance Herg<U+00E9>'s portrayal of the Japanese as the antagonists in his earlier story, ''The Blue Lotus'', particularly given that the occupying government was allied with Japan at the time.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=100}} The use of [[Morocco]] as a setting was likely influenced by ''[[The White Squadron]]'' by French writer [[Joseph Peyr<U+00E9>]], which Herg<U+00E9> had read and seen the film in 1936.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=99|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=95}} The depiction of the [[French Foreign Legion]] in North Africa was possibly influenced by [[P. C. Wren]]'s novel ''[[Beau Geste]]'' (1925) or its cinematic adaptations in [[Beau Geste (1926 film)|1926]], [[Beau Sabreur|1928]], and [[Beau Geste (1939 film)|1939]].{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=47}}

Whereas Herg<U+00E9>'s use of Chinese in ''The Blue Lotus'' was correct, the Arabic script employed in ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' was intentionally fictitious.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=95}} Many of the place names featured in the series are puns: the town of Kefheir was a pun on the French {{lang|fr|''Que faire?''}} ("what is to be done?") while the port of Bagghar derives from the French {{lang|fr|''baggare''}} (scrape, or fight).{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=95}} The name of [[Omar ben Salaad]] is a pun meaning "Lobster Salad" in French.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=46}}

[[File:Tintin - Jumbo before and after.jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=Before and after of a single comic panel from the book showing a black character has been replaced with a white one.|When the book was published in America, Herg<U+00E9> was asked to redraw scenes that depicted the mixing of black and white races. Initially, [[Jumbo (Tintin comics)|Jumbo]] was black (left), while in the redrawn edition he is white (right).]]

In February 1942, Casterman suggested to Herg<U+00E9> that his books be published in a new format; 62-pages rather than the former 100 to 130 pages, and now in full colour rather than black-and-white.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=95|2a1=Goddin|2y=2009|2p=83}} He agreed to this, and in 1943 ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' was re-edited and coloured for publication as an album in 1944.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=95|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=45}} Due to the changes in how the adventure had been serialised at ''Le Soir'', the album at this juncture was only 58 pages long, and thus Herg<U+00E9> filled the missing pages with four full-page colour frames, thus bringing it up to the standard 62-page format.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=102|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=95}} 

In the 1960s, ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'', along with ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]'', became the first ''Tintin'' adventures published in the United States, in [[Little Golden Books]].{{sfn|Owens|2004}} However, Casterman, working with the American publisher [[Western Publishing]], made a number of changes: [[Jumbo (Tintin comics)|Jumbo]], the sailor who Tintin leaves bound and gagged in Captain Haddock's cabin, as well as another man who beats Haddock in the cellar, could not be black Africans as depicted in the original; these were changed to a white sailor and an Arab due to the American publisher's concerns depicting blacks and whites mixing together.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=103|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=96}} The accompanying text was not changed, however, and Haddock still refers to the man who beat him as a "Negro".{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=103|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=96}} Also by request of the Americans, scenes of Haddock drinking directly from bottles of whiskey on the lifeboat and the plane were blanked out, keeping only the text.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=103|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=96|3a1=Owens|3y=2004}} The edited albums later had their blanked areas redrawn by Herg<U+00E9> to be more acceptable, and they appear this way in published editions around the world.{{sfn|Owens|2004}} Casterman republished the original black-and-white version of the story in 1980, as part of the fourth volume in their ''{{lang|fr|Archives Herg<U+00E9>}}'' collection.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=45}} In 1989, they then published a facsimile version of that first edition.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=45}}

==Critical analysis==
Herg<U+00E9> biographer [[Beno<U+00EE>t Peeters]] described the story as a "rebirth" for ''The Adventures of Tintin'' and described the addition of Haddock as "a formidable narrative element", one which "profoundly changed the spirit of the series".{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=124<U+2013>126}} Elsewhere, he asserts that it is Haddock's appearance which "makes this book so memorable" and that he is tempted to define the book by that character's d<U+00E9>but.{{sfn|Peeters|1989|p=66}} Fellow biographer [[Pierre Assouline]] commented that ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' had "a certain charm" stemming from its use of "exoticism and colonial nostalgia, for the French especially, evoking their holdings in North Africa."{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=73}} [[Michael Farr]] asserted that the arrival of Haddock was the most "remarkable" element of the story, offering the series "tremendous new potential".{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=92}} He also thought that the dream sequences reflected the popularity of [[surrealism]] at the time, and that the influence of cinema, in particular the films of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], is apparent in the story.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=96}}

[[Jean-Marc Lofficier]] and Randy Lofficier described the story as "a thinly-disguised remake of ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]''", an ''Adventure of Tintin'' which had been first serialised in 1934. Both feature the smuggling of opium, in crab tins and cigars respectively, and "desert treks, hostile tribes and, at the end, the infiltrating of a secret underground lair."{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=47}} They also opined that artistically, the story represented "a turning point in Herg<U+00E9>'s career", because he had to switch to a daily format in ''Le Soir'', although as a result of this they felt that the final third of the story "seems rushed".{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=47}} Stating that the inclusion of a Japanese detective investigating drug smuggling in the Mediterranean makes no sense within the context of 1940s Europe, they ultimately awarded the story three out of five stars.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|pp=47<U+2013>48}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="As a fun exercise, try to do a 'vulgar' scan of the whole ''oeuvre''. You will pick up on the scenes in ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' where Haddock, delirious with dehydration, pictures Tintin as a bottle of champagne ready to gush and Tintin, himself dreaming that he has been trapped inside a bottle, screams as the Captain, wielding a giant corkscrew, penetrates and screws him."|source=Tom McCarthy, 2006{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=109}} }}
Literary critic [[Jean-Marie Apostolid<U+00E8>s]] of [[Stanford University]], in a [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] review of ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'', commented that this book witnessed Tintin's "real entrance into the community of human beings" as he gains an "older brother" in Haddock.{{sfn|Apostolid<U+00E8>s|2010|p=115}} He also believed that the recurring image of alcohol throughout the story was symbolic of sexuality. In particular, he believed that there was a strong homoerotic subtext between Haddock and Tintin, represented in the two delirious sequences; in one, Haddock envisions Tintin as a champagne bottle frothing at the top (thereby symbolising an ejaculating penis), while in the other, Tintin dreams that he is trapped inside a bottle, with Haddock about to stick a corkscrew into him (thereby symbolising sexual penetration). However,  Apostolid<U+00E8>s notes, in both instances the pair are prevented from realising their sexual fantasies.{{sfn|Apostolid<U+00E8>s|2010|p=118}} Literary critic [[Tom McCarthy (writer)|Tom McCarthy]] concurred with Apostolid<U+00E8>s on this point, also highlighting what he perceived as homoerotic undertones to these two scenes.{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=109}} He also noted that in this ''Adventure'', the manner in which a chance finding of a tin can on a Belgian street leads Tintin into the story is representative of the recurring theme of "Tintin the detective" found throughout the series.{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=18}}

==Adaptations==
In 1947, the first ''Tintin'' motion picture was created: the [[stop motion]]-animated feature film ''[[The Crab with the Golden Claws (film)|The Crab with the Golden Claws]]'', faithfully adapted by producer [[Wilfried Bouchery]] for [[Films Claude Misonne]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lofficier|1a2=Lofficier|1y=2002|1p=87|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=187}} It was first shown at the [[ABC Cinema]] on 11 January 1947 for a group of invited guests.  It was screened publicly only once, on 21 December of that year, before Bouchery declared bankruptcy and fled to [[Argentina]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=188}}

In 1957, the animation company [[Belvision Studios]] produced a string of colour adaptations based upon Herg<U+00E9>'s original comics, adapting eight of the ''Adventures'' into a series of daily five-minute episodes. ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' was the fifth such story to be adapted, being directed by Ray Goossens and written by [[Greg (comics)|Greg]], himself a well-known cartoonist who in later years would become editor-in-chief of ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|pp=87<U+2013>88}}

In 1991, a second animated series based upon ''The Adventures of Tintin'' was produced, this time as a collaboration between the French studio [[Ellipse]] and the Canadian animation company [[Nelvana]]. Adapting 21 of the stories into a series of episodes, each 42 minutes long, with most stories spanning two episodes, ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' was the seventh story produced in the series. Directed by St<U+00E9>phane Bernasconi, critics have praised the series for being "generally faithful", with compositions having been actually directly taken from the panels in the original comic book.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=90}}

A [[motion capture]] [[adventure film]] titled ''[[The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn]]'' directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] and produced by [[Peter Jackson]] was released in the US on 21 December 2011 and in Europe at the end of October 2011.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=340}} Parts of the movie are taken from ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' including the meeting and first adventures of Tintin and Captain Haddock, the ''Karaboudjan'', the flight to Bagghar, and the crab cans (although the plot involving the smuggled opium was not adapted).{{sfn|The Daily Telegraph|2011}} A [[The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn (video game)|video-game tie-in to the movie]] was released October 2011.{{sfn|Ubisoft|2011}}
