The [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) has led the PRC under a [[Single-party state|one-party]] system since the country's establishment in 1949. Despite this, nearly 70% of the PRC's economy has been [[privatization|privatized]] in the past three decades under "[[Socialism with Chinese characteristics]]" <ref>Fan Gang interview (by Pete Engardio), [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_34/b3948478.htm China Is a Private-Sector Economy], ''BusinessWeek'', August 22, 2005.</ref>  [[Chinese economic reform|Economic reforms]] started since 1978 helped lift millions of people out of poverty, bringing the poverty rate down from 53% of population in 1981 to 8% by 2001.<ref>[http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/0,,contentMDK:20634060~pagePK:64165401~piPK:64165026~theSitePK:469382,00.html Fighting Poverty: Findings and Lessons from China<U+2019>s Success] (World Bank).

Despite shortcomings, greater prosperity has led to growing Chinese influence in [[Geopolitics|global]] [[economics|economic]], [[Politics of China|political]], [[military]], [[science|scientific]], [[technology|technological]], and [[Culture of China|cultural]] affairs. 

At over 3.7 million square miles (over 9.6 million km<U+00B2>), the PRC is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by area|third or fourth largest]] country by total area. It is also the world's [[List of countries by population|most populous]] nation, with over 1.3 [[billion]] [[people]], about 20% of the world's population, majority of whom are classified as [[Han Chinese]] ethnic group.

In an ongoing dispute, the PRC [[political status of Taiwan|claims sovereignty over Taiwan]] and some nearby islands, which have been controlled by the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) since 1945. The PRC asserts the Republic of China to be an illegitimate and supplanted entity and administratively categorizes [[Taiwan]] as a province of the PRC. The ROC does not recognize these claims, administering itself as a sovereign country with a democratically elected government and presidency.  The term "[[mainland China]]" is sometimes used to denote the area under the PRC's rule, but usually excludes the two [[Special Administrative Region (China)|Special Administrative Region]]s, [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]].

The PRC is the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|fourth largest economy]] and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|second largest]] including market [[exchange rate]]s and [[China and the United Nations|represents China]] as a permanent member of the [[UN Security Council]] and [[APEC]].  China is the third largest [[export]]er and [[import]]er in the world. Due to its large and growing population, its rapidly growing [[economy]] and [[military spending]] and capabilities, it is contended wether China is to be currently considered a full fledged or emerging superpower.

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:China, Mao (2).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Mao Zedong]] declares the founding of the PRC in 1949.]] -->

[[Image:Communists enter Beijing (1949).jpg|thumb|250px|Soldiers of the victorious [[People's Liberation Army]] entered [[Beijing]] in [[June]] [[1949]].]]The [[Chinese Civil War]] ended in 1949 with the [[Communist Party of China]] in control of the [[mainland China|mainland]], and the [[Kuomintang]] retreating to [[Taiwan]] and some outlying islands of [[Fujian]]. On [[October 1]], [[1949]] [[Mao Zedong]] proclaimed the People's Republic of China, declaring "the Chinese people have stood up."<ref>[http://www.isop.ucla.edu/eas/documents/mao490921.htm THE CHINESE PEOPLE HAVE STOOD UP!]. UCLA Center for East Asian Studies. Retrieved April 16, 2006.</ref>

Following a series of dramatic economic failures, Mao stepped down from his position as chairman in 1959, with [[Liu Shaoqi]], elected by the National People's Congress, as successor. Mao still had a huge influence over the Party, but was removed from day-to-day management of economic affairs, which came under the control of a more moderate leadership consisting of [[Liu Shaoqi]], [[Deng Xiaoping]], and others who initiated economic reforms.

In 1966, Mao and his allies launched the [[Cultural Revolution]], which is viewed by many analysts and historians as an attempt to purge the moderate leadership and strike-back at Mao's rivals by mobilizing the population in support of his thought. Mao's sympathizers argued it as an experiment in direct [[democracy]] and a genuine attempt at fighting [[political corruption|corruption]] and other negative influences within Chinese society. However, Mao's [[personality cult]] at the time and the [[hierarchical]] structure of the "[[Red Guard]]," as well as the economic reconstruction needed after these events, tend to contradict this interpretation. Extreme disorder followed in the wake of the Cultural Revolution, but premier [[Zhou Enlai]] mediated its destructive impacts and helped the moderate forces regain influence.

[[Image:Brzezinski with Deng Xiaoping.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Deng Xiaoping meeting with [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]].]]After Mao's death in 1976 and the arrest of the despised [[Gang of Four]], Deng Xiaoping quickly wrested power from Mao's anointed successor [[Hua Guofeng]]. Although [[Deng Xiaoping|Deng]] never became the head of the Party or State himself, his influence within the Party led the country to economic reforms, exemplified by one of his favorite sayings: "It doesn't matter if a cat is black or white, so long as it catches mice."<ref>Zwaan, Herman de. [http://www.oneliners-and-proverbs.com/I4-J_it-j.html "I4": Oneliners and proverbs It-Jz]. Retrieved April 16, 2006.</ref> The Communist Party subsequently loosened governmental control over people's personal lives and the [[People's Commune|commune]]s were disbanded with many peasants receiving multiple land leases, which greatly increased incentives and agricultural production. This turn of events marked China's transition from a planned economy to a [[mixed economy]]. The PRC adopted its current [[constitution of the People's Republic of China|constitution]] on [[December 4]], [[1982]].

Despite market reforms, the Communist Party of China remains in sole control, requiring the registration and supervision of all civic organizations. The CPC suppresses groups that it claims are threats to social stability and national unity, such as [[Falun Gong]] and the separatist movement in [[Tibet]]. Supporters of these policies claim that they safeguard stability in a society that was torn apart by class differences and rivalries, has no tradition of civil participation, and limited rule of law. Opponents claim that these policies severely curtail [[human rights]] and that they have resulted in a [[police state]], creating an atmosphere of fear and ignorance.

Chinese society has been rapidly modernizing in the last two decades, spawning the largest urban migration within a generation in human history.]]<!-- something to represent the transformation to capitalism -->

In 1989 the death of the pro-reform official, [[Hu Yaobang]], helped to spark the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], during which students and others campaigned for democratic reform and freedom. The protests were soon put down on June 4 when [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] troops entered and forcibly cleared the square, resulting in hundreds of casualties. This event brought worldwide condemnation and sanctions against the PRC government. The [[June 4th Incident|June 4th incident]] has been a taboo subject within the government, though the Party did defend its actions by saying that it was necessary for the continued stability and economic development of the country.

President [[Jiang Zemin]] and Premier [[Zhu Rongji]], both former mayors of [[Shanghai]], led post-Tiananmen China in the 1990s, bringing unprecedented wealth and international standing to the country. Under Jiang Zemin's ten years of administration, China pulled an estimated 150 million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual GDP growth rate of 11.2%. The country formally joined the [[WTO]] in 2001.<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-07/11/content_244499.htm Nation bucks trend of global poverty] (July 11, 2003).

Although China needs economic growth to spur its development, the government has begun to worry that rapid economic growth could negatively impact the country's resources and environment. Another concern is that many people are not benefiting from China's economic miracle. As a result, the PRC, under current President [[Hu Jintao]] and Premier [[Wen Jiabao]], have initiated policies to address these issues, but the outcome remains to be seen.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4913622.stm "China worried over pace of growth"].

==Government and politics==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=the People's Republic of China}}<!-- This section is on the politics of [[Mainland China]] -->
[[Image:Greathallpeople.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Great Hall of the People]], on the west side of [[Tiananmen Square]], is China's parliament building. There are 2,979 representatives in the annual [[National People's Congress|congress]].]]

While the PRC is regarded as a [[communist state]] by many [[Political science|political scientists]], it is also arguably the wealthiest of those that remain. But attempts to characterize the nature of China's political [[structure]] into a single, simple category are typically seen as lacking sufficient depth to be satisfactory.<ref>Boum, Aomar (1999). [http://dizzy.library.arizona.edu/ej/jpe/volume_6/goodmanonoivol6.htm Journal of Political Ecology: Case Studies in History and Society]. Retrieved April 18, 2006.</ref> A major reason for this is that for much of China's history, the state had been ruled by some form of [[Chinese Empire|centralized imperial monarchy]], which was followed by a chaotic succession of largely [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist]] governments as well as [[warlord]]-[[Military occupation|held]] administrations since the last few years of the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1912. Although the PRC [[regime]] has been variously described as [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]], [[communism|communist]], and [[socialism|socialist]], it appears China is slowly becoming [[Capitalism|capitalist]] in its economic system.<ref>[http://www.lrp-cofi.org/PR/ChinaPR53.html China's Capitalist Revolutions] (Winter 1997). Proletarian Revolution.</ref> However, heavy restrictions remain in some areas, most notably on [[Internet censorship in mainland China|the internet]] and in [[freedom of the press|the press]].

The country is mainly run by the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), but there are other political parties in the PRC, called "democratic parties", which participate in the [[People's Political Consultative Conference]] but mostly serve to endorse CPC policies. While there have been some moves toward political liberalization, in that open contested elections are now held at the village and town levels,<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-12/08/content_288018.htm]</ref> and that legislatures have shown some assertiveness from time to time, the party retains effective control over governmental appointments. This is because, in the absence of meaningful opposition, the CPC wins by default in most electorates. <ref>[http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/aib775/aib775n.pdf "Does China<U+2019>s Land-Tenure System Discourage Structural Adjustment?" by Bryan Lohmar and Agapi Somwaru]. 1 May 2006. USDA Economic Research Service. ''URL accessed 3 May 2006.''</ref>  The CPC has been enforcing its rule by clamping down on political dissidents while simultaneously attempting to reduce dissent by improving the economy and allowing public expression of personal grievances so long as they are not organized. Current political concerns in China include lessening the growing gap between rich and poor, and fighting corruption within the government leadership.<ref>[http://www.mindfully.org/WTO/China-Wealth-Gap11may02.htm China sounds alarm over fast-growing gap between rich and poor]. Retrieved April 16, 2006.</ref>  The support that the Communist Party of China has among the Chinese population in general is unclear because there are no consistently contested national elections.<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-12/08/content_288018.htm]</ref>  Also, private conversations and anecdotal information often reveal conflicting views. However, according to a survey conducted in Hong Kong, where a relatively high level of freedom is enjoyed, the current CPC leaders have received substantial votes of support when residents were asked to rank their favourite Chinese leaders from the mainland and Taiwan.<ref>[http://hkupop.hku.hk/english/release/release361.html "HKU POP SITE releases the latest ratings of the top 10 political figures in Mainland China and Taiwan as well as people's appraisal of past Chinese leaders"]. 4 April 2006.

{{main|Foreign relations of the People's Republic of China}}
The PRC maintains diplomatic relations with most countries in the world. In 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China as the sole representative for "China" in the [[United Nations]] and as one of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref>Eddy Chang (Aug 22, 2004). [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2004/08/22/2003199768 Perseverance will pay off at the UN] The Taipei Times.</ref> It is considered a founding member of UN, though the PRC was not in control of China at the time. (See [[China and the United Nations]]). The PRC was also a former member and leader of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].

Under the [[One-China policy]], the PRC has made it a precondition to establishing diplomatic relations that the other country acknowledges its claim to [[Taiwan]] and sever any official ties with the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) government. The government actively opposes foreign travels by former and present Taiwanese officials, such as [[Lee Teng-hui]] and [[Chen Shui-bian]], and other politically controversial figures, such as [[Tenzin Gyatso|Tenzin Gyatso, the current Dalai Lama]] of [[Tibet]].

China has been playing an increasing role in calling for [[free trade area]]s and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbors. In 2004, China proposed an entirely new [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues that pointedly excluded the United States.<ref>Dillon, Dana and John Tkacik Jr, [http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html "China<U+2019>s Quest for Asia"], ''Policy Review'', December 2005 and January 2006, Issue No. 134. Accessed 22 April 2006.</ref> The EAS, which includes [[ASEAN Plus Three]], [[India]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], held its inaugural summit in 2005. China is also a founding member of the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] (SCO), with [[Russia]] and the [[Central Asia|Central Asian]] republics.

Much of the current foreign policy is based on the concept of [[China's peaceful rise]]. However, conflicts with foreign countries have occurred at various times in its recent history, particularly with the [[United States]]; e.g., the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in [[Belgrade]] during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] in May 1999 and the [[U.S.-China spy plane incident]] in April 2001. Also, its foreign relations with many other Western nations suffered for a time following the Tiananmen Square Incident in 1989, sometimes referred to as the Tiananmen Square Massacre or June 4th Incident. The relationship between [[Sino-Japanese relations|China and Japan]] has been strained at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its war-time past to the satisfaction of the PRC, e.g. [[revisionism|revisionist]] comments made by prominent Japanese officials, and insufficient attention paid to the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing Massacre]] and other [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed during [[World War II]] in [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese history textbooks]]. Another point of conflict between the two countries is the frequent visits by Japanese government officials to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], which enshrines thousands of World War II war criminals, including 14 Class A convicts.

The PRC is in a number of [[Foreign relations of the People's Republic of China#International territorial disputes|international territorial disputes]].  China's territorial disputes have led to several localized wars in the last 50 years, including the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] in 1969 and the [[Sino-Vietnam War]] in 1979. In 2001, the PRC and Russia signed the [[Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation Between the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation|Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation]], <ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation] (March 21, 2006). Retrieved April 16, 2006.</ref> which paved the way in 2004 for Russia to transfer Yinlong Island as well as one half of Heixiazi Island to China, ending a long-standing [[Sino-Russian relations|Sino-Russian]] border dispute.  Other territorial disputes include islands in the [[East China Sea|East]] and [[South China Sea]]s, and undefined or disputed borders with [[India]], [[Tajikstan]] and [[North Korea]].

The Party has also been rather unsuccessful at controlling information, and in some cases has had to change policies in response to public outrage. Although organized opposition against the Party is not accepted, demonstrations over local issues are frequently and increasingly tolerated.

This is an indication that Reporters Without Borders considers the PRC one of the countries in the world with the strictest media control.

At times, the PRC is faced with criticism from Western governments and [[NGO]]s concerning allegations of gross human rights violations. These criticisms allege that there existed a widespread practice of lengthy detentions without trial, forced confessions, torture, mistreatment of prisoners, as well as allegations of restrictions on freedoms of [[freedom of speech|speech]], [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], [[freedom of association|association]], [[freedom of religion|religion]], [[freedom of the press|the press]], and [[workers' rights]].<ref name=right>[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/sdc/hr_facts.html China Human Rights Fact Sheet] (March 1995).</ref> Furthermore, China leads the world in capital punishment, accounting for roughly 90% of total death-penalty executions in 2004.<ref>[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0405-07.htm China Leads Death List as Number of Executions Around the World Soars] 5 April 2005.

==Political divisions==
{{main|Political divisions of China}}
The People's Republic of China has administrative control over 22 provinces (<U+7701>); the government of the PRC considers [[Taiwan Province (People's Republic of China)|T<U+00E1>iw<U+0101>n]] (<U+53F0><U+6E7E>) to be its 23<sup>rd</sup> province.<ref>Gwillim Law (April 2, 2005). [http://www.statoids.com/ucn.html Provinces of China]. Retrieved April 15, 2006.</ref> (See [[Political status of Taiwan]] for more information). Apart from provinces, there are 5 [[Autonomous regions]] (<U+81EA><U+6CBB><U+533A>) containing several minority groups, 4 [[Municipality|municipalities]] (<U+76F4><U+8F96><U+5E02>), and 2 [[Special Administrative Region]]s (<U+7279><U+522B><U+884C><U+653F><U+533A>), which enjoy considerable autonomy.

The 22 provinces, 5 autonomous regions and 4 municipalities can be collectively referred to as "[[mainland China]]", a term which usually excludes Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.

The PRC is the largest [[country]] in [[area]] in [[East Asia]] (excluding Russia) and the third largest <ref>[http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1007029394365&a=KCountryProfile&aid=1018965313021 "The People's Republic of China"] (September 7, 2005). Foreign & Commonwealth Office</ref> in the world by land-and-sea area. (However, due to a recent change in the method used by the [[United States]] to calculate its surface area, some countries and international organisations list the United States as third largest. <ref>[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html "Rank Order - Area"] (March 29, 2006). CIA World Factbook.</ref>) It borders 14 nations (counted clockwise from south): [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]] (Burma), [[India]], [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]],<ref>China's border with Pakistan falls in the disputed [[Kashmir]] province. The area under Pakistani-administration is claimed by India.</ref> [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Russia]], [[Mongolia]] and [[North Korea]].

The territory of the PRC contains a large variety of landscapes. In the east, along the shores of the [[Yellow Sea]] and the [[East China Sea]], there are extensive and densely populated [[alluvium|alluvial plains]], while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, grasslands can be seen. Southern China is dominated by hill country and low [[mountain range]]s. In the central-east are the [[river delta|deltas]] of China's two major rivers, the [[Huang He]] and [[Yangtze River]] (Chang Jiang). Other major rivers include the [[Xijiang River]], [[Mekong]], [[Brahmaputra]] and [[Amur]].

To the west, major mountain ranges, notably the [[Himalaya]]s with China's highest point [[Mount Everest]], and high [[plateau]]s feature among the more arid landscapes such as the [[Taklamakan]] and the [[Gobi Desert]].

A major issue is the continued expansion of deserts, particularly the [[Gobi Desert]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4915690.stm "Beijing hit by eighth sandstorm"]. BBC news. Accessed 17 April, 2006.</ref> Although barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of [[sandstorm]]s, prolonged [[drought]] and poor agricultural practices result in [[dust storm]]s plaguing northern China each spring, which then spread to other parts of East Asia, including [[Taiwan]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. Dust from the northern plains has been tracked to the [[West Coast of the United States]].  Water, [[erosion]], and pollution control have become important issues in China's relations with other countries.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of the People's Republic of China|Economy of Hong Kong|Economy of Macau}}

Beginning in late 1978, the Chinese leadership has been [[Chinese economic reform|reforming the economy]] from a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style centrally planned economy to a more [[market]]-oriented economy that is still within a rigid political framework under Party control. The reforms replaced [[collectivization]] with privatization of farmlands, increased the responsibility of local authorities and industry managers, allowed a wide variety of small-scale enterprises to flourish, and promoted foreign investment. Price controls were also relaxed. These changes resulted in mainland China's shift from a [[planned economy]] to a [[mixed economy]], with 70% in the [[private sector]]. China became a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] in 2001.

[[Image:Prc1952-2005gdp.gif|right|thumb|300px|China's [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] trend from 1952 to 2005.]]
The government emphasizes personal income and consumption by introducing new management systems to help increase productivity. The government also focuses on foreign trade as a major vehicle for economic growth, which led to 5 [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZ: Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen, Hainan Province) where investment laws are relaxed so as to attract foreign capital. Since the 1990s, SEZs and similar concepts have been expanded to other major Chinese cities, including Shanghai and Beijing.  The result has been a 6-fold increase of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] since 1978. Chinese economic development is among the fastest in the world, and has been growing at an average annual GDP rate of 9.4% for the past 25 years.<ref>Malik, Khalid (December 16, 2005). [http://www.undp.org.cn/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&catid=13&topic=40&sid=236&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0 "Launch of the China Human Development Report 2005"]. </ref>  At the end of 2005, the PRC became the fourth largest economy in the world by exchange rate, and the second largest in the world after the [[United States]] by [[purchasing power parity]] at US$8,158 trillion <ref>[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/geos/ch.html CIA Factbook]</ref>. But with its large population this still gives an average GDP per person of only an estimated US$1,700.

Mainland China has a reputation as being a low-cost manufacturer, which caused notable disputes in global markets. This is largely because Chinese corporations can produce many products far more cheaply than other parts of Asia or Latin America, and because expensive products produced in [[developed countries]] like the United States are in large part uncompetitive compared to European or Asian goods. Another factor is the unfavorable [[exchange rate]] between the [[Renminbi|Chinese yuan]] and the [[United States dollar]] to which it was [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]].

On July 21, 2005 the [[People's Bank of China]] announced that it would move to a [[managed float|floating peg]], allowing its currency to move against the [[United States dollar]] by 0.3% a day, while 3% a day against other currencies.<ref>[http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/gyzg/t213645.htm China widens yuan, non-dollar trading range to 3%] (September 23, 2005). Retrieved April 15, 2006.</ref> Many high-tech American companies have difficulty exporting to China due to US federal government restrictions, which exacerbated the trade gap between the PRC and the US. On the other hand, China runs a trade deficit with Japan, importing more from Japan than exports to Japan. With the elimination of clothing quotas, China stands to take over a large chunk of the worldwide textile industry. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/26/business/worldbusiness/26CHIN.html?th The New York Times].</ref> <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/02/business/02CHIN.html?th The New York Times].</ref>

Preferential tax incentives are also given as a direct fiscal incentive to manufacture in China, whether for export or for the local market of 1.3 billion people. China is attempting to harmonize the system of taxes and duties it imposes on enterprises, domestic and foreign alike. As a result, preferential tax and duty policies that benefit exporters in special economic zones and coastal cities have been targeted for revision.

There is a large wealth disparity between the coastal regions and the remainder of the country. To counter this potentially destabilizing problem, the government has initiated the [[China Western Development]] strategy (2000), the [[Revitalize Northeast China]] initiative (2003), and the [[Rise of Central China]] policy (2004), which are all aimed at helping the [[interior]] of China to catch up.

After the [[Sino-Soviet split]], China started to develop its own indigenous [[nuclear deterrent]] and delivery systems, successfully detonating its first surface nuclear test in 1964 at [[Lop Nor]]. A natural outgrowth of this was a satellite launching program, which culminated in 1970 with the launching of [[Dong Fang Hong I|Dongfang Hong I]], the first Chinese satellite. This made the PRC the fifth nation to independently launch a satellite. In 1992, the [[Shenzhou]] manned spaceflight program was authorized.<ref>[http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_aboutchina/2003-09/24/content_26079.htm China's First Man-made Satellite] (2003).

The Chinese government continues to place heavy emphasis on [[research and development]] by creating greater public awareness of innovation, and reforming financial and tax systems to promote growth in cutting-edge industries. President Hu Jintao in January 2006 called for China to make the transition from a manufacturing-based economy to an innovation-based one, and this year's National People's Congress has approved large increases in research funding. Controversial areas such as [[stem-cell research]] and [[gene therapy]] face minimal regulation in China.

China is also actively developing its [[software]], [[semiconductor]] and [[energy industry|energy]] industries, including [[renewable energy|renewable energies]] such as hydro, wind and solar power.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/mar2006/gb20060331_921612.htm "Blinding Science: China's Race to Innovate"] Bruce Einhorn, ''Business Week'', 31 March 2006, accessed: 16 April 2006.</ref> In an effort to reduce pollution from coal-burning power plants, China has been pioneering the deployment of [[pebble bed reactor|pebble bed nuclear reactors]], which run cooler and safer, and have potential applications for the [[hydrogen economy]].

Air travel has increased considerably, but remains out of reach for most ordinary mainland Chinese.  Long distance transportation is still dominated by railways and charter bus systems.

Cities are increasingly building [[subways]] or [[light rail]] systems, such as in [[Shanghai]] and [[Beijing]]. [[Transportation in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] has one of the most developed transport systems in the world.

===Religion===
[[Image:incenselonghua.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Incense]] burning in China is a common religious ritual in [[ancestor worship]], [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]].]]
{{Main|Religion in China}}
The majority of Chinese identify themselves as non-religious, which constitute about 59% of the population, or about 767 million people.<ref>''World Desk Reference''. D K Publishing. ISBN 0-7566-1099-0</ref> However, religion and rituals play a significant part in the lives of many, especially the traditional beliefs of [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]]. About 33% of the population follow a mixture of beliefs usually referred to by statisticians as "Traditional Beliefs" or just "Other".

About 6% of the Chinese population are avowed [[Buddhists]], with [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and [[Zen Buddhism]] being the most widely practiced. With an estimated 100 million adherents, Buddhism is the country's largest organized religion. Other forms of Buddhism, such as [[Theravada Buddhism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], are practiced largely by ethnic minorities along the geographic fringes of the Chinese mainland.<ref>Macintosh, R.

===Public health===
{{main|Public health in mainland China}}

The [[Ministry of Health (China)|Ministry of Health]], together with its counterparts in the provincial health bureaus, oversees the health needs of the Chinese population.<ref>[http://www.casy.org/Chindoc/mohprofile.htm China Ministry of Health (MOH)]. 2003. China Aids Survey. Accessed 18 April 2006.</ref> An emphasis on [[public health]] and [[preventative treatment]] characterized health policy since the early 1950s. At that time, the [[Communist Party of China|party]] started the [[Patriotic Health Campaign]], which was aimed at improving [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]], as well as attacking several [[diseases]]. This has shown major results as diseases like cholera, typhoid, and scarlet fever were nearly eradicated. Important gains in public health overall were made during the first three decades of the PRC, despite interruptions during the famine following the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. In the late 1970s, Chinese public health system, largely based in and financed by the People's Communes, had achieved much greater success than most countries at a comparable level of development. 

With economic reform after 1978, the health of the Chinese public improved improved rapidly due to better nutrition despite the disappearance, along with the People's Communes, of much of the free public health services provided in the countryside. Health care in China became largely private fee-for-service. By 2000, when the World Health Organization made a large study of public health systems throughout the world, [http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/ The World Health Report 2000 Health Systems: Improving Performance ] the Chinese public health system ranked 144 of the 191 UN member states ranked.

World Health Organization. Accessed 17 April 2006.</ref>

===Population policy===
{{main|One-child policy}}
With a population of over 1.3 billion, the PRC is very concerned about its population growth and has attempted with mixed results to implement a strict family planning policy. The government's goal is [[one-child policy|one child per family]], with exceptions for ethnic minorities and flexibility in rural areas, where a family can have a second child if the first is a girl or physically disabled. The government's goal is to stabilize population growth early in the 21st century, though some current projections estimate a population of anywhere ranging from 1.4 billion to 1.6 billion by 2025. About 20% of humans live in China alone.

The policy is resisted, particularly in rural areas, because of the need for [[agricultural]] labour and a traditional preference for boys. Families who breach the policy often lie during the census. Official government policy opposes forced abortion or sterilization, but allegations of coercion continue as local officials, who are faced with penalties for failing to curb population growth, may resort to forced abortion or sterilization, or manipulation of census figures.

The decreasing reliability of PRC population statistics since family planning began in the late 1970s has made evaluating the effectiveness of the policy difficult. Estimates by Chinese demographers of the [[Total fertility rate|average number of children for a Chinese woman]] vary from 1.5 to 2.0. The government is particularly concerned with the large imbalance in the [[sex ratio]] at birth, apparently the result of a combination of traditional preference for boys, family planning pressure, and the wide availability of [[ultrasound]], which led to its ban for the purpose of [[sex-selective abortion]].

===Urbanization===
In the past decade, China's cities expanded at an average rate of 10% annually. The country's urbanization rate increased from 17.4% to 41.8% between 1978 and 2005, a scale unprecedented in human history.<ref>Zhou Qun, Lin Yanhua. [http://www.chinanews.cn/news/2005/2005-11-18/14441.html China's urbanization encounters "urban disease"], Chinanews.cn (<U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+65B0><U+95FB><U+7F51>), November 11, 2005. Accessed 21 April 2005.</ref> Caught between urban and rural are the 80 to 120 million [[migrant workers]] who work part-time in the major cities of China and return home to the countryside periodically with their earnings.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/china/migrant_p1.html China 2004 Migrant Workers], CBC Radio One, December 2004. Accessed: 21 April 2006</ref>

Today, the People's Republic of China has dozens of major cities with one million or more long-term residents, including the three [[global cities]] of [[Hong Kong]], [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]]. Major cities in China play key roles in national and regional identity, culture and economics.

The figures ranked below are the 2001 estimates for the ten largest urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists when considering the total municipal populations (which includes suburban and rural populations). The large floating populations of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult;<ref>Francesco Sisci, "China's floating population a headache for census", ''The Straits Times'', 22 September 2000.</ref> the figures below do not include the floating population, only long-term residents.

For centuries, opportunity for economic and social advancement in China could be provided by high performance on [[imperial examinations]]. The literary emphasis of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the view that [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] was a higher form of art than painting or drama. China's traditional values were derived from various versions of [[Confucianism]] and [[conservatism]]. A number of more [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] strains of thought have also been influential, such as [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]]. There was often conflict between the philosophies, such as the [[individualism|individualistic]] [[Song Dynasty]] [[Neo-Confucianism|neo-Confucians]], who believed [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] departed from the original spirit of Confucianism. Examinations and a [[meritocracy|culture of merit]] remain greatly valued in China today. In recent years, a number of [[New Confucianism|New Confucians]] have advocated that democratic ideals and human rights are quite compatible with traditional Confucian "Asian values".<ref>Bary, Theodore de. [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ccba/cear/issues/fall97/graphics/special/debary/debary.htm "Constructive Engagement with Asian Values"]. Columbia University.</ref>
The first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born in the old society but were influenced by the [[May Fourth Movement]] and reformist ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure, sexism, and a Confucian education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and obedience to the state. Many observers believe that the period following 1949 is a continuation of traditional Chinese [[dynastic]] history, while others say that the CPC's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the [[Cultural Revolution]], where many aspects of traditional culture were labeled 'regressive and harmful' or 'vestiges of feudalism' by the regime. They further argue that many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture, such as [[Confucianism]], [[Chinese art]], literature, and performing arts like [[Beijing opera]], were altered to conform to government policies and communist propaganda. The institution of the [[Simplified Chinese]] orthography reform is controversial as well. Today, the PRC government has accepted much of traditional [[Chinese culture]] as an integral part of Chinese society, lauding it as an important achievement of the [[China|Chinese civilization]] and emphasizing it as being vital to the formation of a [[Chinese nationalism|Chinese national identity]].

===Sports and recreation===
China has one of the [[Sports in China|oldest sporting cultures]] in the world, spanning the course of several millennia. There is, in fact, evidence that a form of [[football (soccer)|football]] was first played in [[China]] around 1000 AD, leading many historians to believe that the popular sport originated from China<ref>[http://athleticscholarships.net/history-of-soccer.htm Origins of the Great Game]. 2000. Athleticscholarships.net. Accessed 23 April 2006.</ref>. Besides soccer, some of the most popular sports in the country include [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]], [[table tennis]], [[badminton]], [[basketball]], [[American Football]], and more recently, [[golf]]. [[Board games]] such as [[Chess]], [[Go (board game)|Go]] (Weiqi), and [[Xiangqi]] (Chinese chess) are also commonly played and have organised competitions.

[[Physical fitness]] is highly emphasized in the [[Chinese culture]]. Morning exercises are a common activity and often times one can find the elderly practicing [[qigong]] in parks or students doing stretches on school campuses. Young people are especially keen on [[basketball]], especially in urban centres with limited space and grass areas. The [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] has a huge following among Chinese youths, with [[Yao Ming]] being the idol of many. The [[2008 Summer Olympics]], officially known as the ''Games of the XXIX Olympiad'', will be held in [[Beijing, China]].

Many traditional sports are also played. The popular Chinese [[dragon boat racing]] occurs during the [[Duan Wu festival]]. In [[Inner Mongolia]], sports such as Mongolian-style wrestling and [[horse racing]] are popular. In [[Tibet]], archery and [[equestrian sports]] are a part of traditional festivals. <ref>Qinfa, Ye.
