On 23 November, during a live broadcast of ''[[The X Factor (UK)|X Factor]]'', she broke down in tears and couldn't introduce one of her acts, [[Rachel Hylton]]. After Rachel's performance, it was revealed that fellow judge [[Louis Walsh]] had publicly accused her of "stealing" a song for Rachel to sing that he had wanted for one of his acts, [[JLS]]. That week, Louis had gone to the press and called Dannii "heartless" and said that she should be sacked. [[Simon Cowell]] twice came to Dannii's defence, once in the main live show and then again in the ITV2 extra show, where he accused Walsh  of being childish. Simon went on to say Dannii was perfectly within her rights to choose whatever song she felt was best for her artist. Many fans of ''[[The X Factor (UK)|X Factor]]'' flooded various online communities calling for Louis to be sacked or to make a public apology to Minogue. Cowell ordered Walsh to apologise live on air, but she snubbed Walsh's attempt to apologise. In December 2008 she was publicly voted Metro's #1 celeb of 2008, with [[Cheryl Cole]] coming second. Minogue also finished on top of all the polls for the viewers' favourite ''[[The X Factor (UK)|X Factor]]'' judge, with Cole again coming a close second.<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/xfactor/a136817/dannii-minogue-is-top-x-factor-judge.html "Minogue is Top X Factor judge"]</ref>

At the end of February 2009, [[Simon Cowell]] confirmed to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' that Dannii would return to her role as judge on the ''''[[The X Factor (UK)|X Factor]]  for the auditions only paula abdul will replace her later in the year  On March 30, 2009, Cowell reassured fans he is not planning to get rid of Minogue. Speaking about rumours of a rift between Dannii and Cheryl, Cowell revealed:
''"Dannii kind of got lost a little bit along the way, but I think she does a good job, I really do. There was a lot of focus on Cheryl [last year] but Dannii works harder than all of us. She's so obsessive about winning and I like that."''

In an interview with ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' in April 2009, [[Kylie Minogue]] criticised X Factor judge [[Louis Walsh]] for his jibes at her sister.
''"I'm so proud of my sister and it annoys the hell out of me when comparisons between us are made. In England you lot don't know where she came from. She was on TV every week from seven years old. It makes it harder for her when she gets Louis Walsh's rather pathetic jibes <U+2013> one of which is she hasn't had a hit record and that's just not true."'' She also blasted rumours that Dannii did not get on with Cole or former judge [[Sharon Osborne]] as <U+201C>so cheap<U+201D>. On May 9, 2009 it was announced in ''The Sun'' that Dannii Minogue will return to [[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]] after agreeing terms with Cowell. On June 8 2009, all the ''X Factor'' judges, including Dannii, were pictured attending the first auditions in Scotland. She reportedly signed a contract for <U+00A3>1 million, taking her in line with fellow judge Cheryl Cole.

She also landed a role in the British thriller, ''Vauxhaul Crossed'', which is due to start filming in the summer of 2009, after she has filmed ''[[Australia's Got Talent]]'', but before returning to ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]''.

With [[Paula Abdul]] not returning for the ninth season of [[American Idol]], she had expressed interest in being her replacement. Fellow [[The X Factor (UK)|X-Factor]] judge [[Cheryl Cole]] also expressed the same interest. However, [[Ellen DeGeneres]] has now been confirmed as the new judge replacing Abdul.

Minogue is auditioning for roles in the upcoming seasons of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' and ''[[Ugly Betty]]''.<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.com/ustv/a165688/minogue-hoping-for-housewives-role.html Minogue Hoping for "Housewives" Role], ''Digital Spy'', July 17, 2009</ref>

The sixth series of British television music talent show [[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]] began airing on [[ITV]] on 22 August 2009.[1] Public auditions by aspiring pop singers began in June 2009 and were held in five major cities across the [[United Kingdom]]. Simon Cowell, Dannii Minogue, Louis Walsh, and Cheryl Cole returned to judge the contestants, with auditions being held in front of a live audience for the first time. Following initial auditions, the "Bootcamp" stage took place in August 2009, where the number of contestants was narrowed down to 24. The 24 contestants were split into their categories, Boys, Girls, Over 25s and Groups and given a judge to mentor them at the "''Judges' Houses''" stage and throughout the finals. Dannii was given the Girls to mentor.

At ''Judges Houses'', Dannii was joined by her sister [[Kylie Minogue]] as a guest judge to help her pick her final acts. Dannii's three final acts are [[Rachel Adedeji]], [[Lucie Jones]] and [[Stacey Solomon]]. Live shows began on October 10 2009, in which all acts were required to sing songs chosen between themselves and their judge mentors.

On 10 October 2009, while providing comments on The X Factor regarding artist [[Danyl Johnson]]'s performance, Dannii remarked that Danyl had not needed to switch the words of his chosen song "''[[And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going]]''" from "man" to "girl", because of recent speculation in tabloid newspapers that Danyl may be [[bisexual]]. Danyl appeared visibly upset and responded "''I'm not ashamed''." The remark prompted immediate outrage from viewers demanding Minogue's dismissal from the show.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1219517/X-Factor-Cheryl-Coles-fury-Simon-Cowells-stripper-insult--Dannii-Minogues-bisexual-jibe-nearly-costs-job.html "Dannii Minogue's bisexual jibe nearly costs her job"].

On the live results show on 11 October 2009, Dannii publicly apologised for any offence her comments caused.  She said that her comments were not meant in the way that they were taken.  She also mentioned that she'd spoken to Danyl about her comments, and Danyl agreed that there was no ill-feeling between the two of them.  Nearly 4,000 people complained to [[Ofcom]] about her comments and behaviour. [[Ofcom]] decided to take no further action and the next night [[Simon Cowell]] described the matter as "closed" and apologised for "overreacting."<ref>{{cite news |title=X Factor: Dannii Minogue prompts nearly 4,000 complaints over Danyl Johnson joke |first=Anita |last=Singh |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/6328349/X-Factor-Dannii-Minogue-prompts-nearly-4000-complaints-over-Danyl-Johnson-joke.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |date=14 October 2009 |page= }}</ref> Her live apology was met with a positive reaction.

After receiving the results of her 12 week scan at the end of 2009, Minogue made her first public appearance in the UK at the [[National Television Awards]] in January 2010, where X Factor won Best Talent Show.
