'''The Boeing Company''' ({{nyse|BA}}, {{tyo|7661}}) is a major aerospace and defense corporation, originally founded by William Boeing. Its [[Boeing International Headquarters|international headquarters]] is in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. Boeing is the largest global [[aircraft manufacturer]] by revenue, the second largest by deliveries and the second-largest [[defense contractor|aerospace and defense contractor]] in the world.<ref name="defensenews_2007_ranking">"[http://www.defensenews.com/index.php?S=07top100 "Defense News Top 100" (2006 data)]." ''[[Defense News]]''.</ref><!-- to update previous reference, simply update the year (06=2006). --> 

Boeing has long been one of the world<U+2019>s largest civil aircraft companies. In 2006, it took 55% of global commercial aircraft orders for the first time since 2000. The largest exporter in the United States, Boeing<U+2019>s stock is a component of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]].  

==History==
===Before 1950s===

Boeing was incorporated in [[Seattle, Washington]] by [[William Edward Boeing|William E. Boeing]], on [[July 15]], [[1916]], as the "Pacific Aero Products Co." following the [[June 15]] maiden flight of one of the two "B&W" seaplanes built with the assistance of [[George Conrad Westervelt]], a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] engineer.  On [[May 9]], [[1917]], the company became the "Boeing Airplane Company". William E. Boeing had studied at [[Yale University]] and worked initially in the [[timber]] industry, where he became wealthy and acquired knowledge about [[wood]]en structures. This knowledge would prove invaluable in his subsequent design and assembly of [[fixed-wing aircraft|airplanes]].

[[Image:HPIM1250.jpg|thumb|left|Model of Boeing's first plane, the B&W at Future of Flight Museum shop]]

In 1927 Boeing created an airline named Boeing Air Transport, which merged a year later with [[Pacific Air Transport]] and the Boeing Airplane Company. The company changed its name to United Aircraft and Transport Corporation in 1929 and acquired [[Pratt & Whitney]], [[Hamilton Standard|Hamilton Standard Propeller Company]], and [[Chance Vought]]. United Aircraft then purchased [[National Air Transport]] in 1930. The [[Air Mail Act]] of 1934 prohibited airlines and manufacturers from being under the same corporate umbrella, so the company split into three smaller companies - Boeing Airplane Company, [[United Airlines]], and [[United Aircraft Corporation]], the precursor to [[United Technologies]]. As a result, William Boeing sold off his shares.

[[Image:Boeing314.jpg|thumb|right|The Boeing 314 Clipper]]

Shortly after, an agreement with [[Pan American World Airways]] (Pan Am) was reached, to develop and build a commercial [[flying boat]] able to carry passengers on transoceanic routes. The first flight of the [[Boeing 314|Boeing 314 Clipper]] was in June 1938. It was the largest civil aircraft of its time, with a capacity of 90 passengers on day flights, and of 40 passengers on night flights. One year later, the first regular passenger service from the US to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] was inaugurated. Subsequently other routes were opened, so that soon Pan Am flew with the Boeing 314 to destinations all over the world.

In 1938, Boeing completed work on the [[Boeing 307|Model 307 ''Stratoliner'']]. This was the world<U+2019>s first pressurized-cabin transport aircraft, and it was capable of cruising at an altitude of 20,000 feet. &mdash; above most weather disturbances.

[[Image:Boeing 377 Stratocruiser (B-29) American Overseas 1949-50.jpg|thumb|right|Boeing 377 Stratocruiser]]

During [[World War II]], Boeing built a huge number of [[bomber]]s. Many of the workers were women whose husbands had gone to war. In the beginning of March 1944, production had been scaled up in such a manner that over 350 planes were built each month. To prevent an attack from the air, the manufacturing plants had been covered with greenery and farmland items. During these years of war the leading aircraft companies of the US cooperated. The Boeing-designed [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] bomber was assembled also by [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed Aircraft Corp.]] and [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas Aircraft Co.]], while the [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] was assembled also by [[Bell Aircraft Corporation|Bell Aircraft Co.]] and by [[Glenn L. Martin Company]].

After the war, most orders of bombers were canceled and 70,000 people lost their jobs at Boeing. The company aimed to recover quickly by selling its [[Stratocruiser]], a luxurious four-engine commercial [[airliner]] developed from the B-29. However, sales of this model were not as expected and Boeing had to seek other opportunities to overcome the situation. The company successfully sold military aircraft adapted for troop transportation and for [[aerial refueling]].

===1950s===
[[Image:Boac.707.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|The Boeing 707]]

In the mid-1950s [[technology]] had advanced significantly, which gave Boeing the opportunity to develop and manufacture totally new products. One of the first was the guided short-range [[missile]] used to intercept enemy aircraft. By that time the [[Cold War]] had become a fact of life, and Boeing used its short-range missile technology to develop and build an intercontinental missile.

In 1958, Boeing began delivery of its [[Boeing 707|707]], the United States' first commercial [[jet airliner]], in response to the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[De Havilland Comet]], [[France|French]] [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Tupolev Tu-104]], which were the world<U+2019>s first generation of commercial jet aircraft. With the 707, a four-engine, 156-passenger airliner, the US became a leader in commercial jet manufacture. A few years later, Boeing added a second version of this aircraft, the 720, which was slightly faster and had a shorter [[range(aircraft)|range]]. A few years later, Boeing introduced the [[Boeing 727|727]], a commercial jet airliner of similar size but with three engines, designed for medium-range routes. The 727 was immediately well accepted as a comfortable and reliable aircraft by passengers, crews, and airlines. Although production was discontinued in 1984, at the turn of the millennium nearly 1,300 727s were still in service at airlines around the world.

===1960s===
[[Piasecki Helicopter]], was acquired by Boeing in 1960, and was reorganized as Boeing's [[Boeing Vertol|Vertol division]]. The twin-rotor [[CH-47 Chinook]], produced by Vertol, took its first flight in 1961. This heavy-lift [[helicopter]] remains a work-horse vehicle up to the present day. In 1964, Vertol also began production of the [[CH-46 Sea Knight]].

[[Image:Astraeus.commons.b737-300.g-stra.arp.2.jpg|thumb|left|Boeing 737-300]]

In 1967, Boeing introduced another short- and medium-range airliner, the twin-engine [[Boeing 737|737]]. It has become since then the best-selling commercial jet aircraft in aviation history. The 737 is still being produced, and continuous improvements are made. Several versions have been developed, mainly to increase [[seating capacity]] and range.

The roll-out ceremonies for the first [[Boeing 747|747-100]] took place in 1968, at the massive new factory in [[Everett, Washington|Everett]], about an hour's drive from Boeing's Seattle home. The aircraft made its first flight a year later. The first commercial flight occurred in 1970. The 747 has an intercontinental range and a larger seating capacity than Boeing's previous aircraft.

[[Image:UA747.HNL.1973..reprocessed.arp.jpg|thumb|right|The 707 and 747 formed the backbone of many major airline fleets through the end of the 1970s]]

Boeing also developed [[Boeing hydrofoils|hydrofoils]] in the 1960s. The screw driven [[USS High Point (PCH-1)|USS ''High Point'' (PCH-1)]] was an experimental submarine hunter. The patrol hydrofoil [[USS Tucumcari (PGH-2)|USS ''Tucumcari'' (PGH-2)]] was more successful. Only one was built, but it saw service in Vietnam and Europe before running aground in 1972. Its innovative waterjet{{Fact|date=February 2007}} and fully submersed flying foils were the model for the later Pegasus class patrol hydrofoils and Jetfoil ferries in the 1980s. The Tucumcari and later boats were produced in Renton. While the Navy hydrofoils were withdrawn by the end of the 1980s, the swift and smooth [[Boeing Jetfoil]]s are still in service in Asia.

===1970s===

In the beginning of the [[1970s]], Boeing faced a new crisis. The [[Apollo program]], in which Boeing had participated significantly during the preceding decade, was almost entirely canceled. Once more, Boeing hoped to compensate with sales of its commercial airliners. At that time, however, there was a heavy recession in the airlines industry so that Boeing did not receive one single order for more than one year. Boeing<U+2019>s bet for the future, the new 747, was delayed in [[Manufacturing|production]] and exceeded its estimated development budget. Another problem was that in 1971, the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] decided to stop the financial support for the development of the [[supersonic]] [[Boeing 2707|2707]], Boeing<U+2019>s answer to the British-French [[Concorde]], forcing the company to discontinue the project. The company had to reduce the number of employees from over 80,000 to almost half, only in the Seattle area. 

[[Image:747 flight attendants.jpg|thumb|right|Uniformed flight attendants representing each of the 747's initial 26 airline customers]]

In January 1970, the first 747, a four-engine long-range airliner, flew its first commercial flight. This famous aircraft completely changed the way of flying, with its 450-passenger [[seating capacity]] and its upper deck. Until 2001, Boeing had been the only aircraft manufacturer to offer such an airliner and has delivered nearly 1,400 units. (Airbus now offers the [[Airbus A380|A380]], which when delivered will be the largest operational airliner). The 747 has undergone continuous improvements to keep it technologically up-to-date. Larger versions have also been developed by stretching the upper deck. 

During the 1970s, Boeing also developed light rail vehicles which were used in San Francisco, Boston and Morgantown, WV. They were a limited success as different models would be chosen to replace them by the 2000s, although the [[Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit|Morgantown, WV Personal Rapid Transit]] (PRT) is still in active service at West Virginia University. Most of the Boston cars were decommissioned and destroyed by early 2007.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}

===1980s===
[[Image:Ba B757-200.g-cpen.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|The narrowbody Boeing 757 replaced the 707 and 727]]

In 1983, the economic situation began to improve. Boeing assembled its 1,000th 737 passenger airliner. During the following years, commercial aircraft and their military versions became the basic equipment of airlines and air forces. As passenger air traffic increased, competition was harder, mainly from a [[Europe]]an newcomer in commercial airliner manufacturing, Airbus. Boeing had to offer new aircraft, and developed the single-aisle [[Boeing 757|757]], the larger, twin-aisle [[Boeing 767|767]], and upgraded versions of the 737. An important project of these years was the [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]], to which Boeing contributed with its experience in space rockets acquired during the Apollo era. Boeing participated also with other products in the space program, and was the first contractor for the [[International Space Station]]. At the same time, several military projects went into production, <!-- like the [[RAH-66 Comanche]] helicopter, (wrong helicopter, that was a 00s one that never went into production) --> the Avenger air defense system and a new generation of short-range missiles. During these years, Boeing was very active upgrading existing military equipment and developing new ones.

===1990s===
[[Image:FGSQD.jpg|thumb|right|[[Air France]] 777-300ER]]

In April 1994, Boeing introduced its most modern commercial jet aircraft, the twin-engine [[Boeing 777|777]], with a [[seating capacity]] of between 300 and 400 passengers in a standard three class layout, in between the 767 and the 747. The longest range twin-engined aircraft in the world, the 777 was the first Boeing airliner to feature a "[[Aircraft flight control systems|fly-by-wire]]" system and was conceived in response to the inroads being made by the European Airbus into Boeing<U+2019>s traditional market. This aircraft reached an important milestone by being the first airliner to be designed entirely by using [[computer-aided design|CAD]] techniques. Also in the mid-1990s, the company developed the revamped version of the 737, known as the <U+201C>Next-Generation 737<U+201D>, or 737NG. It has since become the fastest-selling version of the 737 in history, and on [[April 20]], [[2006]] sales passed those of the 'Classic 737', with a follow-up order for 79 aircraft from [[Southwest Airlines]]. The <U+201C>Next-Generation 737<U+201D> line includes the 737-600, the 737-700, the 737-800, and the 737-900.

<!-- [[Image:Boeing History Timeline.PNG|thumb|Boeing Company Timeline.{{rfu-c|[[2007-04-06]]}}]] -->
In 1996, Boeing acquired [[Rockwell International|Rockwell]]<U+2019>s aerospace and defense units. The Rockwell products became a subsidiary of Boeing, named Boeing North American, Inc. In August of the next year, Boeing merged with [[McDonnell Douglas]] to form The Boeing Company. Following the merger, the McDonnell Douglas MD-95 was renamed the [[Boeing 717]], and the production of the MD-11 was limited to the freighter version. Boeing introduced a new corporate identity with completion of the merger, incorporating the Boeing logo type and a stylized version of the McDonnell Douglas symbol, which was derived from the Douglas Aircraft logo from the 1970s.
[[Image:2004-09-14 1680x3000 chicago boeing building.jpg|thumb|right|Boeing's headquarters in Chicago]]

===2000s===
In September [[2001]], Boeing moved its corporate headquarters from [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] to [[Chicago]]. 

On [[October 10]] [[2001]], Boeing lost to its rival [[Lockheed Martin]] in the fierce competition for the multi-billion dollar [[Joint Strike Fighter Program|Joint Strike Fighter]] contract. Boeing<U+2019>s entry, the [[Boeing X-32|X-32]], was rejected in favor of Lockheed<U+2019>s [[F-35  Lightning II|F-35]] entrant.

[[Image:ISS after completion (as of June 2006).jpg|thumb|right|[[International Space Station]]]] <!-- Appears to be a future configuration, probably final one. -->
Boeing continues to serve as the prime contractor on the International Space Station and has built several of the major components.

In recent years Boeing has faced an increasingly high [[Competition between Airbus and Boeing|competition from Airbus]], which offers some commonality between models (reducing maintenance and training costs) and the latest [[Aircraft flight control systems|fly-by-wire]] technology. From the 1970s Airbus has increased its family of aircraft to the point where they can now offer an aircraft in almost every class Boeing does. Indeed, Airbus is now competing in markets that Boeing once had a monopoly over, e.g. the [[Airbus A320|A320]] has been selected by several [[low cost carrier|low-cost operators]] (the aircraft used by these airlines has traditionally been the 737) and the very large aircraft market, the [[A380]]. The 747 has suffered by competing with Boeing's 777-300 model.

After several decades of numerous successes, Boeing lost ground to Airbus and subsequently lost its position as market leader in 2003. Multiple Boeing projects were pursued and then canceled. The [[Boeing Sonic Cruiser|Sonic Cruiser]] is among these projects. The Boeing Sonic Cruiser was launched in 2001 along with a new [[advertising]] campaign to promote its new motto, "Forever New Frontiers", and rehabilitate its image. Boeing is now focused on the newly-launched [[Boeing 787|787 Dreamliner]] as a platform of total fleet rejuvenation, which uses technology from the Sonic Cruiser concept. The result is that the 787 is the fastest selling [[Wide-body aircraft|wide body]] airliner in history.

In 2004, Boeing ended production of the [[Boeing 757|757]] after 1055 were produced. More advanced, stretched versions of the 737 were beginning to compete against the 757, and the new [[Boeing 787|787-3]] will fill some of the top end of the 757 market.  Also that year, Boeing announced that the [[Boeing 717|717]], the last civil aircraft to be designed by McDonnell Douglas, would cease production in 2006.  The 767 was in danger of cancellation as well, with the 787 replacing it, but recent orders for the freighter version have extended the program. If Boeing wins the contract for new USAF tankers, the 767 program will continue for years to come. 

[[Image:Airbus Boeing net orders 2002 2006.png|right|thumb|350px|Plane net orders [[2002]]-[[2006]] ]]

Recently, Boeing launched a new aircraft, the [[Boeing 787|787 Dreamliner]], and five new variants of existing designs: ultra-long-range [[Boeing 777|777-200LR]], 737-900ER, 737-700ER, 777 Freighter and 747-8. The 777-200LR has the longest range of any commercial aircraft and was first delivered in 2006.  The 737-900ER and 737-700ER will extend the range of the -900 and -700 models.  Due to rising fuel costs, the more efficient [[twinjet]] 777 has been winning orders. The rapid success of the 787 has resulting in Airbus following suit with the competing [[A350]], though the latter still lags behind in development and orders. The [[747-8]] is a stretched version of the 747-400 and will offer improved efficiency and longer range. Following frequent delays to the [[Airbus A380]] program, some airlines stated they were considering switching their orders to the 747-8 instead.<ref name="times_delays_20061004">{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/engineering/article659591.ece|title=Airbus will lose <U+20AC>4.8bn because of A380 delays|first=David|last=Robertson|publisher=The Times Business News|date=[[October 4]], [[2006]]}}</ref> 

In May 2005, Boeing announced its intent to form a joint venture, [[United Launch Alliance]] with its competitor Lockheed Martin. The new venture will be the largest provider of rocket launch services to the US government. The joint venture gained regulatory approval and completed the formation on December 1, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2006/q4/061201a_nr.html |title=Boeing and Lockheed Martin Complete United Launch Alliance Transaction (news release) |publisher=The Boeing Company |date=01 Dec 2006 |accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref>

On [[August 2]], [[2005]] Boeing sold its [[Rocketdyne]] rocket engine division to [[Pratt & Whitney]].

On [[May 1]] [[2006]], Boeing announced that it had reached a definitive agreement to purchase Dallas, Texas-based [http://www.aviall.com Aviall, Inc.] for $1.7 billion and retain $350 million in debt. Aviall, Inc. and its subsidiaries, Aviall Services, Inc. and ILS formed a wholly owned subsidiary of Boeing Commercial Aviation Services (BCAS).[http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2006/q3/060920c_nr.html]

====Unethical conduct====
In May 2003, the [[US Air Force]] announced it would lease 100 [[KC-767]] tankers to replace the oldest 136 of its [[KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135]]s. The 10 year lease would give the USAF the option to purchase the aircraft at the end of the contract. In September 2003, responding to critics who argued that the lease was vastly more expensive than an outright purchase, the DOD announced a revised lease of 74 aircraft and purchase of 26.

In December 2003, the Pentagon announced the project was to be frozen while an investigation of allegations of corruption by one if its former procurement staffers, [[Darleen Druyun]] (who had moved to Boeing in January) was begun. The fallout of this resulted in the resignation of Boeing [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Philip M. Condit]] and the termination of [[Chief financial officer|CFO]] [[Michael M. Sears]]. [[Harry Stonecipher]], former McDonnell Douglas CEO and Boeing COO, replaced Condit on an interim basis.

Druyun pleaded guilty to inflating the price of the contract to favor her future employer and to passing information on the competing [[Airbus A330 MRTT]] bid (from [[EADS]]). In October 2004, she was sentenced to nine months in jail for corruption, fined $5,000, given three years of supervised release and 150 hours of community service.

In March 2005, the Boeing board forced [[President]] and CEO Harry Stonecipher to resign. Boeing said an internal investigation revealed a "consensual" relationship between Stonecipher and a female executive that was "inconsistent with Boeing's Code of Conduct" and "would impair his ability to lead the company".<ref>[http://www.comspacewatch.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=16323 Boeing CEO Stonecipher Resigns press release]</ref> [[James A. Bell]] served as interim CEO (in addition to his normal duties as Boeing<U+2019>s [[Chief financial officer|CFO]]) until the appointment of [[Jim McNerney]] as the new [[Chairman]], President, and CEO on [[June 30]], [[2005]].

====Industrial espionage====

In June 2003, Lockheed Martin sued Boeing alleging that the company had resorted to [[industrial espionage]] in 1998 to win the [[Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle]] (EELV) competition. Lockheed alleged that the former employee Kenneth Branch, who went to work for [[McDonnell Douglas]] and Boeing, passed 25,000 proprietary documents to his new employers. Lockheed argued that these documents allowed Boeing to win 21 of the 28 tendered military satellite launches.

In July 2003, Boeing was penalized, with the Pentagon stripping $1 billion worth of contracts away from the company and awarding them to Lockheed Martin. Furthermore, the company was forbidden to bid for rocket contracts for a twenty-month period which expired in March 2005. 

In early September 2005, it was reported that Boeing was negotiating a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice in which it would pay up to $500 million to cover this and the Darleen Druyun scandal.<ref>[http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2005/09/05/daily53.html?from_rss=1 Boeing, DOJ may reach settlement]</ref>

====Subsidy disputes====

In October 2004, Boeing filed a complaint at the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), claiming that [[Airbus]] had violated a 1992 bilateral accord when it received what Boeing deems as <U+201C>unfair<U+201D> subsidies from several European governments. Airbus retaliated by filing another complaint, contesting that Boeing had also violated the accord when it received tax breaks from the U.S. Government. Moreover, the E.U. also complained that the investment subsidies from Japanese airlines violated the accord.

On [[January 11]] [[2005]], Boeing and Airbus agreed that they would attempt to find a solution to the dispute outside of the WTO.

However, in June 2005, Boeing and the United States government reopened the trade dispute with the WTO, claiming that Airbus had received illegal subsidies from European governments. Airbus has also retaliated against Boeing, reopening the dispute and also accusing Boeing of receiving subsidies from the US government.<ref name="subsidies">{{cite web|url=http://igeographer.lib.indstate.edu/pritchard.pdf| title=Industrial Subsidies and the Politics of World Trade: The Case of the Boeing 7e7| publisher=Canada-United States Trade Center| format=PDF | pages=17}}</ref>

===Recent product development===

Boeing has recently achieved several consecutive successes, beginning with the formal launch of the 787 for delivery to [[All Nippon Airways]] and [[Air New Zealand]]. Rollout of the first [[Boeing 787|787]] occurred on [[July 8]], [[2007]]. 

Boeing also received the launch contract from the [[US Navy]] for the [[P-8 Multimission Maritime Aircraft]], an [[anti-submarine warfare]] patrol aircraft. Several orders for the [[Boeing Wedgetail|Wedgetail]] AEW&C airplanes are expected as well.

Boeing launched the [[Boeing 777|777 Freighter]] in May 2005 with an order from Air France.  The freighter variant is based on the -200LR.  Other customers include [[FedEx Express|FedEx]], [[Emirates]], and [[Air Atlanta Icelandic]].

Boeing has achieved above projected orders for its 787 Dreamliner, outselling the rival [[Airbus A350]]. A large blow to Airbus came as Emirates Airlines president Tim Clark stated that his airline must be convinced that the 250 to 290-seat A350 would not repeat the "misses" by Airbus in performance and delivery. Emirates has held off ordering either airplane as it tries to convince Boeing to build a larger version of the 787, the 787-10, which is the airline<U+2019>s preferred option. Air Canada also dealt Airbus a blow by replacing its A330 and A340 fleet with 96 Boeing 777s and 787s.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

Boeing officially announced in November 2005 that it would produce a larger variant of the 747, the 747-8, in two models, commencing with the Freighter model for two cargo carriers with firm orders for the aircraft. The second model, dubbed the Intercontinental, would be produced for passenger airlines that Boeing expected would place orders in the near future. Both models of the 747-8 would feature a lengthened fuselage, new, advanced engines and wings, and the incorporation of other technologies developed for the 787.

Boeing has also introduced new extended range versions of the 737. These include the 737-700ER and 737-900ER.  The 737-900ER is the latest and will extend the range of the 737-900 to a similar range as the successful 737-800 with the capability to fly more passengers, due to the addition of two extra emergency exits.

[[Image:B777-200LR DSC04302.JPG|thumb|right|The record-breaking 777-200LR Worldliner, presented at the [[Paris Air Show]] 2005]]

The 777-200LR Worldliner embarked on a well-received global demonstration tour in the second half of 2005, showing off its capacity to fly farther than any other commercial aircraft. On [[November 10]] [[2005]], the 777-200LR set a world record for the longest non-stop flight. The plane, which departed from Hong Kong traveling to London, took a longer route, which included flying over the U.S. It flew 11,664 nautical miles (21,601km) during its 22-hour 42-minute flight.

Realizing that increasing numbers of passengers have become reliant on their computers to stay in touch, Boeing introduced [[Connexion by Boeing]], a satellite based Internet connectivity service that promised air travelers unprecedented access to the World Wide Web. The company debuted the product to journalists in 2005, receiving generally favorable reviews.  However, facing competition from cheaper options, such as cellular networks, it proved too difficult to sell to most airlines.  In August 2006, after a short and unsuccessful search for a buyer for the business, Boeing chose to discontinue the service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5261562.stm |title=Boeing exits in-flight broadband |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=17 Aug 2006 |accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2006/q3/060817a_nr.html |title=Boeing to Discontinue Connexion by Boeing Service (news release) |publisher=The Boeing Company |date=17 Aug 2006 |accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref>

====Future concepts====

In May 2006, four concept designs being examined by Boeing were outlined in the [[Seattle Times]]. Codenamed after the well-known [[Muppets]] (the design team is known as the Green Team), the designs concentrated primarily on reducing fuel usage. All four designs illustrated rear-engine layouts. 
* "[[Fozzie Bear|Fozzie]]" employs open rotors and would offer a lower cruising speed. 
* "[[Dr. Bunsen Honeydew|Beaker]]" has very thin, long wings, with the ability to partially fold-up to facilitate easier taxiing. 
* "[[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]] Kruiser" has forward swept wings over which are positioned its engines, with the aim of lowering noise below due to the reflection of the exhaust signature upward. 
* "[[Dr. Bunsen Honeydew|Honeydew]]" with its delta wing design, resembles a marriage of the [[flying wing]] concept and the traditional tube fuselage. 

As with most concepts, these designs are only in the exploratory stage intended to help Boeing evaluate the potentials of such radical technologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002973147_boeingconcepts05.html |title=Clean engines, wings that fold: Boeing dreams of futuristic jets |publisher=The Seattle Times |author=Dominic Gates |date=18 May 2006}}</ref>

==Environmental record==
Researchers at the [[University of Massachusetts]] have listed Boeing as the thirteenth-largest corporate producer of [[air pollution]] in the United States.<ref>[http://www.peri.umass.edu/Toxic-100-Table.265.0.html Political Economy Research Institute, The Toxic 100]</ref>  According to the [[Center for Public Integrity]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] has linked Boeing to more than twenty [[Superfund]] [[toxic waste]] sites.<ref>[http://www.publicintegrity.org/Superfund/SiteResults.aspx?act=boeing Center for Public Integrity]</ref> In [[2006]], the [[UCLA]] Center for Environmental Risk Reduction released a study showing that Boeing's [[Santa Susana Field Laboratory]] in [[Ventura]], [[California]] had been contaminated with toxic and [[radioactive waste]]. The study found that [[air]], [[soil]], [[groundwater]], and surface water at the site all contained [[radionuclides]], toxic metals, and [[dioxins]]; air and water additionally contained [[perchlorate]], [[TCE]], and [[hydrazines]], while water showed the presence of [[PCBs]] as well.<ref>[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/erg/current.html Center for Environmental Risk Reduction, UCLA]</ref>
