'''Howard Zinn''' (August 24, 1922 <U+2013> January 27, 2010)<ref name="bost-death" /> was an [[United States|American]] [[historian]] and Professor of Political Science at [[Boston University]] from 1964 to 1988.<ref>{{cite web |author=July 05, 2008 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF7GoDYEbfQ |title=Howard Zinn'a political philosophy connected to democratic socialism, although he was sympathetic to anarchism|publisher=Youtube.com |date=2008-07-05 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> He was the author of more than 20 books, including ''[[A People's History of the United States]]'' (1980). Zinn was active in the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights]], [[civil liberties]] and [[Peace movement|anti-war]] movements in the United States, and wrote extensively on all three subjects.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Zinn was born to a [[Jew]]ish immigrant family in [[Brooklyn]]. His father, Eddie Zinn, born in [[Austria-Hungary]], immigrated to the U.S. with his brother Phil before the outbreak of [[World War I]]. Howard's mother Jenny Zinn emigrated from the Eastern [[Siberia]]n city of [[Irkutsk]].

Both parents were factory workers with limited education when they met and married, and there were no books or magazines in the series of apartments where they raised their children. Zinn's parents introduced him to literature by sending 25 cents plus a coupon to the ''[[New York Post]]'' for each of the 20 volumes of Charles Dickens' collected works.<ref>[http://www.zmag.org/zmag/articles/barzinn.htm HOWARD ZINN- One Step Ahead of the Landlord].</ref> He also studied creative writing at [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Brooklyn, New York)|Thomas Jefferson High School]] in a special program established by poet Elias Lieberman.<ref>[http://www.educationupdate.com/archives/2004/apr04/issue/col_howardzinn.html Appel, Jacob M. Chronicing Lives From Spelman College to B.U. ''Education Update'', April 2004].</ref>

===World War II===
Zinn eagerly joined the [[Army Air Force]] during [[World War II]] to fight fascism, and he bombed targets in [[Berlin]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/v/Ehc3V1g5pm0&rel=1&border=0 |title=film clip of Zinn |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> Zinn's later anti-war stance was, in part, informed by his own experiences in the military. In April, 1945, he participated in one of the first military uses of [[napalm]], which took place in [[Royan]], [[France]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Zinn |first=Howard |title=Declarations of Independence |year=1990 |publisher=HarperPerennial |location=New York, NY |isbn=0060921080}}</ref> [[File:Howard Zinn bombardier England 1945.jpg|frame|right|2nd Lieut. Howard Zinn, bombardier, Army Air Force in England, 1945.]]The bombings were aimed at German soldiers who were, in Zinn's words, hiding and waiting out the closing days of the war. The attacks killed not only the German soldiers but also French civilians, facts Zinn uncovered nine years after the bombings when he visited Royan to examine documents and interview residents. In his books, ''The Politics of History'' and ''The Zinn Reader,'' he described how the bombing was ordered at the war's end by decision-makers most probably motivated by the desire for career advancement rather than for legitimate military objectives.

Zinn said his experience as a bombardier, combined with his research into the reasons for and effects of the bombing of Royan, sensitized him to the ethical dilemmas faced by [[GI (military)|G.I.s]] during wartime.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://progressive.org/mag_zinn0106 |title=Interview with Zinn |publisher=Progressive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> Zinn questioned the justifications for military operations inflicting civilian casualties in the Allied bombing of cities such as [[Dresden]], Royan, [[Tokyo]], and [[Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in World War II, [[Hanoi]] during the U.S. [[war in Vietnam]], and [[Baghdad]] during the U.S. war in [[Iraq]]. In his pamphlet "Hiroshima: Breaking the Silence", Zinn laid out the case against targeting civilians.<ref>[http://cps-www.bu.edu/~amaral/Personal/zinn.html Interview with Zinn].</ref>

===Education===
After World War II, Zinn attended [[New York University]] on the [[GI Bill]], graduating with a B.A. in 1951 and [[Columbia University]], where he earned an M.A. (1952) and Ph.D. in history with a minor in political science (1958). His master's thesis examined the Colorado coal strikes of 1914.<ref name="educationupdate2004">Appel, JM. [http://www.educationupdate.com/archives/2004/apr04/issue/col_howardzinn.html Howard Zinn: Chronicling Lives from Spelman College to Boston U.], April 2004.</ref> His [[doctoral dissertation]] ''LaGuardia in Congress'' was a study of [[Fiorello LaGuardia]]'s congressional career, and depicted LaGuardia representing "the conscience of the twenties" as LaGuardia fought for public power, the right to strike, and the redistribution of wealth by taxation.<ref name="educationupdate2004"/> "His specific legislative program," Zinn wrote, "was an astonishingly accurate preview of the [[New Deal]]." It was published by the Cornell University Press for the American Historical Association. While at Columbia, his professors included [[Harry Carman]], [[Henry Steele Commager]], and [[David Donald]].<ref name="educationupdate2004"/> ''La Guardia in Congress'', won the [[American Historical Association]]'s [[Beveridge Award|Beveridge Prize]] as the best English-language book on American history.{{citation}}

He was also a [[post-doctoral]] Fellow in East Asian Studies at [[Harvard University]] from 1960 to 1961.

===Academic career===
Zinn was Professor of [[History]] at [[Spelman College]] in Atlanta, Georgia from 1956 to 1963. Later he was Professor of [[Political Science]], [[Boston University]] from 1964 to 1988. He was also Visiting Professor at both the [[University of Paris]] and [[University of Bologna]].

Zinn came to believe that the point of view expressed in traditional history books was often limited. He wrote a history textbook, ''[[A People's History of the United States]]'', to provide other perspectives on American history. The textbook depicts the struggles of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] against European and U.S. conquest and expansion, slaves against slavery, unionists and other workers against capitalists, women against [[patriarchy]], and African-Americans for [[civil rights]]. The book was a finalist for the [[National Book Award]] in 1981.<ref>http://www.nationalbook.org/nba_winners_finalist_50_07.pdf</ref>

In the years since the first edition of ''A People's History'' was published in 1980, it has been used as an alternative to standard textbooks in many high school and college history courses, and is one of the most widely known examples of [[critical pedagogy]]. According to the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' it "routinely sells more than 100,000 copies a year".<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/books/review/30donadio.html "Backlist to the Future"] by Rachel Donadio, July 30, 2006</ref>

In 2004, Zinn published ''[[Voices of A People's History of the United States]]'' with [[Anthony Arnove]]. ''Voices'' expands on the concept of ""A People's History'' and provides a large collection of dissident voices in long form. It is intended as a companion to ''A People's History'' and parallels its structure.

''[[The People Speak (film)|The People Speak]]'', scheduled for release on DVD in February 2010, is a documentary movie inspired by the lives of ordinary people who fought back against oppressive conditions over the course of the history of the United States. The film includes performances by Zinn, [[Matt Damon]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Josh Brolin]], [[Danny Glover]], [[Marisa Tomei]], [[Don Cheadle]], and [[Sandra Oh]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2009/11/03/people-s-history-moves-small-screen |title=people-s-history-moves-small-screen bu.edu 2009/11/03 |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2009-11-04 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://howardzinn.org/default/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=103&Itemid=55 |title=howardzinn.org |publisher=howardzinn.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/content/people-speak |title=History channel |publisher=History.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> An original soundtrack<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/People-Speak-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B002UK6DTA/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1264646521&sr=8-3 |title=The People Speak: Original Soundtrack: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> for [[The People Speak]] featuring [[Bob Dylan]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[Lupe Fiasco]], [[P!nk]], [[Eddie Vedder]] and more is available everywhere now.
===Civil Rights movement===
In 1956, Zinn was appointed chairman of the department of history and social sciences at [[Spelman College]], where he participated in the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights movement]]. There he lobbied with historian [[August Meier]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2003may/meier.html |title=Biography of August Meier |publisher=Oah.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> "to end the practice of the Southern Historical Association of holding meetings at segregated hotels."<ref>[[Organization of American Historians]]. Obituary of August Meier, May 2003 by John Bracey [[University of Massachusetts]], [[Amherst]] [http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2003may/meier.html].</ref>

At Spelman, Zinn served as an adviser to the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) and in 1964, wrote the book ''SNCC: The New Abolitionists''. He also collaborated with historian [[Staughton Lynd]] and mentored young student activists, among them writer [[Alice Walker]] and [[Marian Wright Edelman]], founder and president of the [[Children's Defense Fund|Children<U+2019>s Defense Fund]]. In a journal article, Edelman discusses Zinn as major influence in her life and she tells of his accompanying students to a sit-in at the segregated white section of the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] state legislature.<ref>Edelman, Marian Wright. "Spelman College: A Safe Haven for A Young Black Woman." ''The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education'', no. 27 (2000): 118-123.</ref>

Although Zinn was a tenured professor, he was dismissed in June 1963, after siding with students in their desire to challenge Spelman's traditional emphasis of turning out "young ladies" when, as Zinn described in an article in ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]],'' Spelman students were likely to be found on the picket line, or in jail for participating in the greater effort to break down segregation in public places in Atlanta. Zinn's years at Spelman are recounted in his autobiography ''You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train: A Personal History of Our Times.'' His seven years at Spelman College, Zinn said, "are probably the most interesting, exciting, most educational years for me. I learned more from my students than my students learned from me."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people/Zinn/zinn-con2.html |title=Interview with Zinn |publisher=Globetrotter.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref>

While at Spelman, Zinn wrote that he observed 30 violations of the First and Fourteenth amendments to the [[United States Constitution]] in [[Albany, Georgia]], including the rights to [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of assembly]] and [[equal protection]] of the laws. In an article on the civil rights movement in Albany, Zinn described the people who participated in the [[Freedom Rides]] to end segregation, and of the reluctance of President [[John F. Kennedy]] to enforce the law.<ref>http://www.zmag.org/zmag/articles/oldzinn.htm</ref> Zinn has also pointed out that the Justice Department under [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], headed by [[J. Edgar Hoover]], did little to nothing to stop the segregationists from brutalizing civil rights workers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mediafilter.org/mff/fbi.html |title=Media Filter article on Zinn |publisher=Mediafilter.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref>

Zinn wrote frequently about the struggle for civil rights, both as a participant and historian<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reportingcivilrights.org/authors/biblio.jsp?authorId=85 |title=Zinn biography |publisher=Reportingcivilrights.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> His second book, ''The Southern Mystique''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.identitytheory.com/people/birnbaum10.html |title=Intervew with Zinn |publisher=Identitytheory.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> was published in the same year as his book on the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), 1964. In the book on SNCC, Zinn describes how the sit-ins against segregation were initiated by students and, in that sense, independent of the older, more established civil rights organizations.

He returned to Spelman in 2005 to give the commencement address.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.exodusnews.com/education/education051.htm |title=Exodus News article on Zinn |publisher=Exodusnews.com |date=2005-05-11 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= |first= Victoria |last= Brittain |title=Howard Zinn's Lesson To Us All |newspaper= [[The Guardian]]|date= 28 January 2010|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jan/28/howard-zinn-america}}</ref> His speech "Against Discouragement,"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/2728/graduation_day_with_howard_zinn |title=Tomgram: Graduation Day with Howard Zinn |publisher=Tomdispatch.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> is available online at numerous sources.

===Anti-war efforts===
Fresh from writing two books about his research, observations, and participation in the Civil Rights movement in the South, Zinn accepted a position in the political science department at Boston University in 1964. His classes in [[civil liberties]] were among the most popular offered at BU with as many as 400 students subscribing each semester to the non-required class. He taught at BU for 24 years and retired in 1988. Zinn wrote one of the earliest books calling for the U.S. withdrawal from its war in [[VietNam]]. ''VietNam: The Logic of Withdrawal'' was published by Beacon Press in 1967 after articles that would later form the basis for the book had appeared in ''[[Commonwealth]]'', ''[[The Nation]],'' ''The Register-Leader,'' and ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]].''

====Vietnam====
Zinn's diplomatic visit to Hanoi with Rev. [[Daniel Berrigan]], during the Tet Offensive in January 1968, resulted in the return of three American airmen, the first American ''POWs'' released by the North Vietnamese since the U.S. bombing of that nation had begun. The event was widely reported in the news media and discussed in a variety of books including ''Who Spoke Up? American Protest Against the War in Vietnam 1963<U+2013>1975'' by Nancy Zaroulis and Gerald Sullivan.<ref>{{cite book |title=Who Spoke Up? American Protest Against the War in Vietnam 1963<U+2013>1975|publisher=Horizon Book Promotions|date= 1989|ISBN=0-385-17547-7}}</ref> Zinn remained friends and allies with the Berrigan brothers, Dan and [[Philip Berrigan|Philip]], over the years.

[[Daniel Ellsberg]], a former [[RAND]] consultant who had secretly copied ''[[The Pentagon Papers]]'', which described internal planning and policy decisions of the United States in the Vietnam War, gave a copy of them to Howard and Roslyn Zinn.<ref>[Ellsberg autobiography, Zinn autobiography]</ref> Along with [[Noam Chomsky]], Zinn edited and annotated the copy of ''The Pentagon Papers'' that Ellsberg entrusted to him. Zinn's longtime publisher, Beacon Press, published what has come to be known as the Senator [[Mike Gravel]] edition of ''The Pentagon Papers,'' four volumes plus a fifth volume with analysis by Chomsky and Zinn.

At Ellsberg's criminal trial for theft, conspiracy, and espionage in connection with the publication of the ''Pentagon Papers'' by ''The [[New York Times]]'', defense attorneys called Zinn as an expert witness to explain to the jury the history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam from World War II to 1963. Zinn discussed that history for several hours, later reflecting on his time before the jury. "I explained there was nothing in the papers of military significance that could be used to harm the defense of the United States, that the information in them was simply embarrassing to our government because what was revealed, in the government's own interoffice memos, was how it had lied to the American public. The secrets disclosed in the Pentagon Papers might embarrass politicians, might hurt the profits of corporations wanting tin, rubber, oil, in far-off places. But this was not the same as hurting the nation, the people," Zinn wrote in his autobiography. Most of the jurors later said they voted for acquittal. [p.&nbsp;161] However, the federal judge dismissed the case on the grounds it had been tainted by President [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon]]'s administration's [[Daniel Ellsberg#Fielding break-in|burglary of the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist]].

Zinn's testimony as to the motivation for government secrecy was confirmed in 1989 by [[Erwin Griswold]], who as U.S. solicitor general during the Nixon administration, prosecuted ''The New York Times'' in the Pentagon Papers case in 1971.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/opinion/la-op-blanton21may21,0,1992884.story |title=The lie behind the secrets |author=Blanton, Tom |date=2006-05-21 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2008-01-21}}</ref> Griswold persuaded three Supreme Court justices to vote to stop ''The New York Times'' from continuing to publish the Pentagon Papers, an order known as "prior restraint" that has been held to be illegal under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[U.S. Constitution]]. The papers were simultaneously published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', effectively nulling the effect of the prior restraint order. In 1989, Griswold admitted there was no national security damage from publication of the papers.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> In a column in the ''Washington Post'', Griswold wrote: "It quickly becomes apparent to any person who has considerable experience with classified material that there is massive over classification and that the principal concern of the classifiers is not with national security, but with governmental embarrassment of one sort or another."

Zinn supported the G.I. antiwar movement during the U.S. war in Vietnam. In the 2001 film ''[[Unfinished Symphony]]'', Zinn provides historical context for the 1971 antiwar march by [[Vietnam Veterans against the War]]. The marchers traveled from [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]], [[Massachusetts]], to [[Battle of Bunker Hill|Bunker Hill]], "which retraced [[Paul Revere]]'s ride of 1775 and ended in the massive arrest of 410 veterans and civilians by the Lexington police." The film depicts "scenes from the 1971,<ref>{{cite book |title=Winter Soldier Investigation |date=1971}}</ref> during which former G.I.s testified about atrocities" they either participated in or witnessed in Vietnam.<ref>http://www.chss.montclair.edu/english/furr/unfinished.pdf</ref>

====Iraq====
[[File:hzphotoneutral-3.jpg|frame|200px|right|Howard Zinn in Wellfleet on Cape Cod.]]
Zinn opposed the invasion and occupation of Iraq, and wrote several books about it. He asserted that the U.S. would end its war with, and occupation of, Iraq when resistance within the military increased, in the same way resistance within the military contributed to ending the U.S. war in Vietnam. He compared the demand by a growing number of contemporary U.S. military families to end the war in Iraq to the parallel "in the Confederacy in the Civil War, when the wives of soldiers rioted because their husbands were dying and the plantation owners were profiting from the sale of cotton, refusing to grow grains for civilians to eat."<ref>[http://www.tomdispatch.com/index.mhtml?emx=x&pid=20715 Interview with Zinn].</ref> Zinn argued that "There is no flag large enough to cover the shame of killing innocent people for a purpose which is unattainable."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Zinn/Tripoli_ZR.html |title="Terrorism Over Tripoli" from ''Zinn Reader'', Seven Stories Press (1993) excerpted online |publisher=Thirdworldtraveler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref>

Jean-Christophe Agnew, Professor of History and American Studies at [[Yale University]], told the ''[[Yale Daily News]]'' in May 2007 that Zinn<U+2019>s historical work is "highly influential and widely used".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/21049 |title=Zinn calls for activism |publisher=Yale Daily News |date=2007-05-03 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> He observed that it is not unusual for prominent professors such as Zinn to weigh in on current events, citing a resolution opposing the war in Iraq that was recently ratified by the [[American Historical Association]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.historians.org/news/166/iraq-war-resolution-is-ratified-by-aha-members |title=American Historical Association Blog: Iraq War Resolution is Ratified by AHA Members |publisher=Blog.historians.org |date=2007-03-12 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> Agnew added, <U+201C>In these moments of crisis, when the country is split <U+2014> so historians are split.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web |last=Yu |first=Lea |url=http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/05/04/963/ |title=Historian Howard Zinn Calls for Activism <U+2013> CommonDreams.org |publisher=CommonDreams.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref>

===Death===
While traveling, Zinn died of an apparent heart attack in [[Santa Monica, California]] on [[January 27]], [[2010]]. He is survived by his daughter Myla Kabat-Zinn, son Jeff Zinn and five grandchildren.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2010/01/howard_zinn_his.html |author=Feeney M, Marquard B |title=Howard Zinn, historian who challenged status quo, dies at 87. |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=2010-01-27 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref>

==Awards==
Zinn received the [[Thomas Merton]] [[Thomas Merton Award|Award]] and the [[Eugene V. Debs Award]]. In 1998, he won the [[Lannan Literary Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lannan.org/lf/bios/detail/howard-zinn/ |title=Lannan Foundation <U+2013> Howard Zinn |publisher=Lannan.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> for nonfiction and the following year won the [[Upton Sinclair Award]], which honors social activism. In 2003, Zinn was awarded the ''Prix des Amis du [[Monde diplomatique]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amis.monde-diplomatique.fr/article.php3?id_article=252 |title=Prix des Amis du Monde diplomatique 2003 <U+2013> Les Amis du Monde diplomatique |publisher=Amis.monde-diplomatique.fr |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> for the French version of his seminal work, ''Une histoire populaire des Etats-Unis.''
