==Construction==
USP Victorville is a 630,000 square foot (58,500 m<U+00B2>) high-security prison constructed by Hensel Phelps Construction Co. and Crosby Group of [[Redwood City, California]] for US$101.4 million (security system constructed by Buford Goff and Associates, Inc.) and operated by the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] (B.O.P).

Six V-shaped buildings (units 1-3 on east side, units 4-6 on west side) facing each other and a larger maintenance building surround a central yard with a tower in the middle. Six additional towers are lined along the rectangular shaped facility. The facility is surrounded by a lethal electrical double fence, a 2 m (8 ft) brickstone wall on its northern side and a view protection fence on its western side. Cells are approximately 4 <U+00D7> 2 m (13 <U+00D7> 7 feet) in size equipped with a bunkbed, a stainless steel sink-toilet combination and a small table with a non-removable stool. Cells are usually occupied by two inmates and are air conditioned. The administrative and disciplinary unit (SHU) can hold 238 inmates. Cells in the disciplinary unit have showers and are occupied by three inmates when overcrowding occurs (one inmate is forced to sleep on the floor in such cases).
