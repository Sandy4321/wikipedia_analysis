The '''dog''' is a type of [[canine]], a [[mammal]] in the order [[Carnivora]].  The term includes both [[wild dog|wild]] (feral) and [[pet|domestic]] variants, but commonly excludes other canids such as [[wolf|wolves]]. 

Over time, the dog has developed into hundreds of [[Dog breed|breeds]] with a great degree of variation.  For example, heights at the [[withers]] range from just a few inches (such as the [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]]) to roughly three feet (such as the [[Irish Wolfhound]]); colors vary from white through grays (usually called ''blue'') to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark ("red" or "chocolate") in a tremendous variation of patterns; and [[Coat (dog)|coat]]s can be anything from very short to several centimeters long, from coarse hair to something akin to wool, straight or curly.

Genetic research has identified 14 ancient dog breeds, with the oldest being the [[Chow Chow]], [[Shar Pei]], [[Akita Inu]], [[Shiba Inu]] and [[Basenji]].  Because many of the 14 breeds are associated with China and Japan, the theory that the dog originated in Asia seems to be likely.<ref name=Savolainen_et_al_2002/>

As humans migrated around the planet a variety of dog forms migrated with them.  The [[agricultural revolution]] and subsequent [[urban revolution]] led to an increase in the dog population and a demand for [[Specialization (functional)|specialization]].  These circumstances would provide the opportunity for [[selective breeding]] to create specialized [[working dog]]s and [[pet]]s.

=== Human relationships ===
Dogs, like humans, are highly [[social animal]]s and this similarity in their overall behavioral pattern accounts for their trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations.  This similarity has earned dogs a unique position in the realm of interspecies relationships.

The loyalty and devotion that dogs demonstrate as part of their natural instincts as pack animals closely mimics the human idea of love and friendship, leading many dog owners to view their pets as full-fledged family members.  Conversely, dogs seem to view their human companions as members of their pack, and make few, if any, distinctions between their owners and fellow dogs.  Dogs fill a variety of roles in [[human society]] and are often trained as [[working dog]]s.  For dogs that do not have traditional jobs, a wide range of [[dog sports]] provide the opportunity to exhibit their natural skills.  In many countries, the most common and perhaps most important role of dogs is as [[companion dog|companions]].

Dogs have lived with and worked with humans in so many roles that their loyalty has earned them the unique [[sobriquet]] "man's best friend".<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>  However, some cultures consider dogs to be [[unclean animals|unclean]].  In some parts of the world, dogs are raised as [[livestock]] to produce [[dog meat]] for human consumption.  In many places, consumption of dog meat is discouraged by social convention or [[Taboo food and drink|cultural taboo]].

==Terminology== 

The [[English language|English]] word [[wikt:dog|dog]], in common usage, refers to the domestic [[pet]] dog, ''Canis lupus familiaris''. The species was originally classified as ''Canis familiaris'' by Linnaeus in 1758. In 1993, dogs were reclassified as a subspecies of the gray wolf, ''Canis lupus'', by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the [[American Society of Mammalogists]]. "Dog" is sometimes used to refer collectively to any mammal belonging to the family ''[[Canidae]]'' (as in "the dog family"), such as wolves, foxes, and coyotes. Some members of the family have "dog" in their common names, such as the [[African Wild Dog]]. The constellations [[Canes Venatici]], [[Canis Major]] and [[Canis Minor]] are named from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for "dog," for their perceived resemblance to dogs. 

The English word ''dog'' might derive from the Old English [[wikt:docga|docga]], a "powerful breed of canine". The French ''dogue'' and Spanish ''dogo'' as in [[dogo Argentino]] are borrowings from English. The English word ''hound'' is a cognate of the German ''Hund'' and Dutch ''hond'' which, though referring to a specific breed in English, means "dog" in general in German and Dutch. ''Hound'' itself derives from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *kwon-, which is the direct root of the Greek <U+03BA><U+03C5><U+03C9><U+03BD> (ku<U+014D>n) and the indirect root of the Latin [[canis]] through the variant form *kani-.<Ref>

In breeding circles, a male canine is referred to as a ''dog'', while a female canine is called a ''bitch''. Offspring are generally called ''pups'' or ''[[puppy|puppies]]'' until they are about a year old. A group of offspring is a ''litter''. The process of birth is ''whelping''. Many [[Mixed-breed dog#Terms for mixed-breed dogs|terms are used for dogs]] that are not purebred.

==Intelligence==
{{main|Dog intelligence}}
[[Image:Dog_retrieving_stick.jpg|thumb|179px|Many dogs can easily be trained to retrieve.]]
Among dog lovers, dogs are generally valued for their intelligence, and both [[anecdotal evidence]] and [[Scientific method|scientific research]] suggest that dogs have a reasonably high intelligence. This intelligence is expressed differently with different breeds and individuals, however. For example, [[Border Collie]]s are noted for their ability to learn commands, while other breeds may not be so motivated towards obedience, but instead show their cleverness in devising ways to steal food or escape from a yard. Being highly adaptable animals themselves, dogs have learned to do a great number of very eclectic jobs as man has required over the generations. Dogs are employed in various roles across the globe, proving invaluable assets in areas such as search-and-rescue; law enforcement (including attack dogs, sniffer dogs and tracking dogs); guards for livestock, people or property; herding; Arctic exploration sled-pullers; guiding the blind and acting as a pair of ears for the deaf; assisting with hunting, and a great many other roles which they may be trained to assume.  
Dogs are descended from wolves, and are also pack animals, making them easier than other animals to train because dogs' instincts are to obey. Most dogs rarely have to deal with complex tasks and are unlikely to learn relatively complicated activities (such as opening doors) unaided. Some dogs (such as [[guide dog]]s for the visually impaired) are specially trained to recognize and avoid dangerous situations.

===Evaluation of a dog's intelligence===
The meaning of "intelligence" in general, not only in reference to dogs, is hard to define. Some tests measure problem-solving abilities and others test the ability to learn in comparison to others of the same age.  Defining it for dogs is just as difficult.  It is likely that dogs do not have the ability to premeditate an action to solve a problem. Some dogs may, however, have more drive to keep trying various things until they accidentally reach a solution and still others might have more ability to make the association between the "accident" and the result.{{cn}}

For example, the ability to learn quickly could be a sign of [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]]. Conversely it could be interpreted as a sign of blind subservience and a desire to please.  In contrast, some dogs who do not learn very quickly may have other talents. An example is breeds that are not particularly interested in pleasing their owners, such as [[Siberian Husky|Siberian Huskies]]. Huskies are often fascinated with the myriad of possibilities for escaping from yards, catching small animals, and often figuring out on their own numerous inventive ways of doing both.

[[Assistance dog]]s are also required to be obedient at all times. This means they must learn a tremendous number of commands, understand how to act in a large variety of situations, and recognize threats to their human companion, some of which they might never before have encountered.

Many owners of [[livestock guardian dog|livestock guardian]] breeds believe that breeds like the [[Great Pyrenees]] or the [[Kuvasz]] are not easily trained because their stubborn nature prevents them from seeing the point of such commands as <U+201C>sit<U+201D> or <U+201C>down<U+201D>. [[Hounds]] may also suffer from this type of ranking. In fact several rank in the bottom tier of "The Intelligence of Dogs" list (such as [[Beagle]]s, [[Bloodhound]]s, and [[Basset Hound]]s).{{cn}}  These dogs are bred to have more of a "pack" mentality with other dogs and less reliance on a master's direct commands. While they may not have the same kind of intelligence as a Border Collie, they were not bred to learn and obey commands quickly, but to think for themselves while trailing game.

==Physical characteristics== 	 
{{main|Dog anatomy}}
[[Image:Weimaraner wb.jpg|thumb|right|Some dogs, like this [[Weimaraner]], have their predatory instincts suppressed in order to better assist human hunters.]]
{{see also|Dog health}}	 
Modern [[dog breed]]s show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal. Within the range of extremes, dogs generally share attributes with their wild ancestors, the [[Gray Wolf|wolves]]. Dogs are [[predator]]s and [[scavenger]]s, possessing sharp teeth and strong jaws for attacking, holding, and tearing their food. Although selective breeding has changed the appearance of many breeds, all dogs retain basic traits from their distant ancestors. Like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wristbones, a [[cardiovascular]] system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing. Compared to the bone structure of the human foot, dogs technically walk on their toes.

===Sight===
[[Image:Amazonian Dog.JPG|right|A|thumb|200px|Amazonian dogs, such as this one from [[Alto Amazonas]], [[Peru]] are critical for [[indigenous peoples]]' [[hunting]] strategies, particularly in the [[rain forest]].]]

Dogs were thought to be [[dichromat]]s and thus, by human standards, [[color blind]].<ref name="note1">A&E Television Networks (1998). ''Big Dogs, Little Dogs: The companion volume to the A&E special presentation'', A Lookout Book, GT Publishing. ISBN 1-57719-353-9 (hardcover).</ref><ref name="note2">Alderton, David (1984). ''The Dog'', Chartwell Books. ISBN 0-89009-786-0.</ref>  It is now known that dogs can't see the colour red very well.

Different breeds of dogs have different eye shapes and dimensions, and they also have different [[retina]] configurations.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = Jonica Newby, Caroline Penry-Davey | title = Catalyst: Dogs' Eyes | work = | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 25 September 2003 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/s953902.htm | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2006-11-26 }}</ref>  Dogs with long noses have a "''visual streak''" which runs across the width of the retina and gives them a very wide field of excellent vision, while those with short noses have an "''area centralis''" -- a central patch with up to three times the density of nerve endings as the ''visual streak'' -- giving them detailed sight much more like a human's.

Some breeds, particularly the best [[sighthound]]s, have a field of vision up to 270<U+00B0> (compared to 180<U+00B0> for humans), although broad-headed breeds with short noses have a much narrower field of vision, as low as 180<U+00B0>.<ref name="note1" /><ref name="note2" />

===Hearing===
[[Image:PennyAlertPricksEars.jpg|thumb|left|This [[Collie]]/[[Saluki]] angles her ears to find the source of a sound.]]
Dogs detect sounds as low as the 16 to 20[[Hertz|Hz]] frequency range (compared to 20 to 70 Hz for humans) and above 45 kHz<ref>[http://www.lsu.edu/deafness/HearingRange.html How well do dogs and other animals hear]</ref> (compared to 13 to 20 kHz for humans)<ref name="note2" />, and in addition have a degree of ear mobility that helps them to rapidly pinpoint the exact location of a sound. Eighteen or more muscles can tilt, rotate and raise or lower a dog's ear. Additionally, a dog can identify a sound's location much faster than a human can, as well as hear sounds up to four times the distance that humans are able to. Those with more natural ear shapes, like those of wild canids like the fox, generally hear better than those with the floppier ears of many domesticated species.

===Smell===

Dogs have nearly 220 million smell-sensitive cells over an area about the size of a pocket [[handkerchief]] (compared to 5 million over an area the size of a [[postage stamp]] for humans). Some breeds have been selectively bred for excellence in detecting scents, even compared to their canine brethren. What information a dog actually detects when he is scenting is not perfectly understood; although once a matter of debate, it now seems to be well established that dogs can distinguish two different types of scents when trailing, an air scent from some person or thing that has recently passed by, as well as a ground scent that remains detectable for a much longer period. The characteristics and behavior of these two types of scent trail would seem, after some thought, to be quite different, the air scent being intermittent but perhaps less obscured by competing scents, whereas the ground scent would be relatively permanent with respect to careful and repetitive search by the dog, but would seem to be much more contaminated with other scents. In any event, it is established by those who train tracking dogs that it is impossible to teach the dog how to track any better than it does naturally; the object instead is to motivate it properly, and teach it to maintain focus on a single track and ignore any others that might otherwise seem of greater interest to an untrained dog. An intensive search for a scent, for instance searching a ship for contraband, can actually be very fatiguing for a dog, and the dog must be motivated to continue this hard work for a long period of time.

==Detection dogs and other variations==
There are several types of [[working dogs]]:

*The [[detection dog]], which is a dog trained to and works at using its senses (almost always the sense of smell) to detect substances such as explosives or [[illegal drugs]].
*Hunting dogs that search for game.
*Search dogs that search for missing humans.

Some less used types include the [[war dog]] and [[pariah dog]].

==Diet==

At present, there is some debate as to whether domestic dogs should be classified as [[omnivores]] or [[carnivores]], by diet.
The classification in the Order [[Carnivora]] does not necessarily mean that a dog's diet must be restricted to [[meat]]; unlike an obligate carnivore, such as the [[cat]] family with its shorter [[small intestine]], a dog is dependent on neither meat-specific protein nor a very high level of protein in order to fulfill its basic dietary requirements. Dogs are able to healthily digest a variety of foods including [[vegetable]]s and [[cereal|grains]], and in fact can consume a large proportion of these in their diet. Wild canines not only eat available plants to obtain [[essential amino acid]]s, but also obtain nutrients from vegetable matter from the stomach and intestinal contents of their [[herbivorous]] prey, which they usually consume. Domestic dogs can survive healthily on a reasonable and carefully designed [[vegetarian]] diet, particularly if [[egg (food)|eggs]] and [[milk]] products are included. Some sources suggest that a dog fed on a [[strict vegetarian]] diet may develop [[dilated cardiomyopathy]] since it lacks [[L-carnitine]], <ref>''Small animal internal medicine'', RW Nelson, Couto page 107</ref> however, maintaining a balanced diet is also a factor since [[L-carnitine]] is found naturally in many [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[seed]]s, [[bean]]s, [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s and [[whole grain]]s. In the wild, dogs can survive on a vegetarian diet when animal prey is not available. However it has been noted, both by observation of extremely stressful conditions such as the [[Iditarod (race)|Iditarod race]] and by scientific studies of similar conditions, that high-protein (approximately 40%) diets including meat help prevent damage to [[muscle]] tissue. (This research is also true for some other mammals.) This level of protein corresponds to the percentage of protein found in the wild dog's diet when prey is abundant; higher levels of protein seem to confer no added benefit.

Dogs frequently eat [[grass]], which is a harmless activity. Explanations abound, but rationales such as that it neutralizes [[acid]], or that eating grass might make the dog [[vomit]], so dogs eat grass to remove unwanted substances from their [[stomach]]s, are at best educated guesses. Dogs do vomit more readily than humans, as part of their typical feeding behavior of gulping down food then regurgitating indigestible bones, fur, ''etc.'' This behavior is typical of pack feeding in the wild, where the most important thing is to get as much of the kill as possible before others consume it all. Individual domestic dogs, however, may be very "picky" eaters, in the absence of this evolutionary pressure. 

===Dangerous substances===

Some foods commonly enjoyed by humans are dangerous to dogs, including [[chocolate]] ([[Theobromine poisoning]]), [[onion]]s, [[grape]]s and [[raisin]]s <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aspca.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=16645 | title = ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center Issues Nationwide Update: Raisins and Grapes Can Be Toxic To Dogs | accessmonthday = September 2 | accessyear = 2006 | date = 2004-07-06 | work = ASPCA Press Releases | publisher = American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals }}</ref>, some types of [[chewing gum|gum]], certain sweeteners<ref>{{cite web|url=http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articlenews.aspx?type=topNews&storyID=2006-09-29T225449Z_01_N29420115_RTRUKOC_0_UK-LIFE-DOGS.xml|title=Dog owners warned over sugar-free items|publisher=Reuters}}</ref> and [[Macadamia nut]]s. It is currently believed that the only dangerous substance in chocolate is [[cocoa]], meaning that forms of chocolate without this compound, such as [[white chocolate]] may become re-evaluated for their safety in future.

The acute danger from grapes and raisins has been uncovered only since about 2000, and made public slowly since then. At present the cause is not known, but one [[veterinarian]] <ref>{{cite web | url = http://dogtorj.tripod.com/id10.html | title = Who is DogtorJ? (Contact) | accessmonthday = September 2 | accessyear = 2006 | first = John B. | last = Symes}}</ref> believes it may be an acute [[auto-immune]] response to plant-borne viruses <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chazhound.com/forums/showthread.php?t=591 | title = Finally, some reliable info on grapes & raisins | accessmonthday = September 2 | accessyear = 2006 | author = Renee750il | work = Chazhound Dog Forum | date = 2004-07-17}}</ref> in the same manner as [[Feline infectious peritonitis|FIP]] in cats. Whatever the reason, since only small quantities are necessary to induce acute [[renal failure]], dogs should not be fed grapes or raisins, and [[Sultana (grape)|sultanas]] and [[currants]] should likely be withheld as well.

Cooked [[bone]]s should '''never''' be given to dogs, as the heat changes the chemical and physical properties so that they cannot be chewed properly, splintering into jagged shards, and resist digestion.

Human medications should not be given to a dog as a substitute for their regular medication as some can be especially [[toxic]], especially [[paracetamol]]/acetaminophen (Tylenol).
[[Alcoholic beverage]]s pose much of the same hazards to dogs as they do to humans.

Dogs may also find some poisons attractive, including [[antifreeze]], [[snail]] bait, [[insect]] bait, and [[rodent]] poisons. [[Antifreeze]] may be one of the most insidious of poisons to dogs because of its sweet taste and because a dog may walk upon or lie down upon a spill of it or its residue and then lick it off. Dogs must be kept strictly away from antifreeze and not allowed access to any place that has had a spill of it that has not been completely removed. 

Plants such as [[caladium]], [[dieffenbachia]] and [[philodendron]] will cause [[throat]] irritations that will burn the throat going down as well as coming up. [[Hops]] are particularly dangerous and even small quantities can lead to [[malignant hyperthermia]]. <ref>{{cite journal | first = K. L.| last = Duncan | coauthors = W. R. Hare and W. B. Buck | date = 1997-01-01 | title = Malignant hyperthermia-like reaction secondary to ingestion of hops in five dogs | journal = Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association | volume = 210 | issue = 1 | pages = 51-4 | id = {{PMID|8977648}}}}</ref>

[[Amaryllis]], [[daffodil]], [[english ivy]], [[Iris (plant)|iris]], and [[tulip]] (especially the bulbs) cause [[gastric]] irritation and sometimes [[central nervous system]] excitement followed by [[coma]], and, in severe cases, even death.

Ingesting [[foxglove]], [[lily of the valley]], [[larkspur]] and [[oleander]] can be life threatening because the [[cardiovascular]] system is affected. Equally life threatening is the [[yew]] which affects the nervous system. If any of these plants are ingested, get the dog to a veterinarian immediately.

Many household cleaners such as [[ammonia]], [[bleach]], [[disinfectants]], [[drain cleaner]], [[soap]]s, [[detergent]]s, and other cleaners, [[mothball]]s and [[matches]] are dangerous to dogs, as are cosmetics such as [[deodorant]]s, [[hair coloring]], [[nail polish]] and remover, [[permanent wave|home permanent]] lotion, and [[suntan lotion]].

[[Zinc]] toxicity, mostly in the form of the ingestion of [[Cent (United States coin)|US pennies]] minted after 1982, is commonly fatal in dogs where it causes a severe [[hemolytic anemia]]. <ref>Stowe CM, Nelson R, Werdin R, et al: Zinc phosphide poisoning in dogs. JAVMA 173:270, 1978</ref>

Dogs will occasionally eat their own feces or the feces of other species if available, such as that of cats and horses. This is known as [[coprophagia]], and may be indicative of boredom or hunger, although there is no definitive reason known. Owners of both cats and dogs may find that dogs treat the catbox as a snack bar. Such behavior should be discouraged, as it could lead to [[Toxoplasmosis]].

==Reproduction==
{{main|Canine reproduction}}
===General===
In domestic dogs, sexual maturity ([[puberty]]) begins to happen around age 6 to 12 months for both males and females, although this can be delayed until up to two years old for some large breeds. [[Adolescence]] for most domestic dogs is around 12 to 15 months, beyond which they are for the most part more adult than puppy. As with other domesticated species, [[domestication]] has selectively bred for higher [[libido]] and earlier and more frequent breeding cycles in dogs, than in their wild ancestors.

===Males===
{{sectstub}}

===Females===
Females have a twice-yearly fertile period, known as 'seasons', during which her body prepares for [[pregnancy]], and at the peak she will come "into heat", her fertile period, during which time she will be mentally and physically receptive to [[copulation]]. A female is able to become pregnant on her first heat; this is not normally considered advisable as she is mentally and physically still young in other ways. 

As with most domesticated species, one of the first and strongest effects seen from selective breeding is selection for cooperation with the breeding process as directed by humans. In domestic dogs, one of the behaviours that is noted is the abolition of the pair bond seen in wild canines. The ability of female domestic dog to come into [[estrus]] at any time of the year and usually twice a year is also valued. The amount of time between cycles varies greatly among different dogs, but a particular dog's cycle tends to be consistent through her life. This is also called ''in season'' or ''in heat''. Conversely, undomesticated canine species experience estrus once a year, typically in late winter.

Most female dogs come into season for the first time between 6 and 12 months, although some larger breeds delay until as late as 2 years. Like most mammals, the age that a bitch first comes into season is mostly a function of her current body weight as a proportion of her body weight when fully mature. The different rates of maturation are responsible for the [[menarche]], not the chronological age. They then experience fertile seasons biannually until old age. Female dogs do not experience menopause, although their cycles will become irregular and fertility becomes unpredictable as the become older. Dogs over around 7 or 8 years are usually considered no longer appropriate for breeding, but can still remain fertile.

===Copulation===
{{Unreferencedsect|date=January 2007}}
When [[copulating]], a male canine initially mounts the female from behind, as with most [[tetrapod]]s, a position known informally as [[doggy style]]. The female will hold her tail to the side and allow this if receptive. If unreceptive she may sit or lie down, snap, move away, or otherwise be uncooperative or not allow mating. The male will often move about as he tries to get a good purchase upon her, and whilst attempting [[sexual penetration|penetration]] of his [[penis]] to the female's [[vulva]]. At this point, the penis is not [[erection|erect]], it is slender and held rigid by a small bone inside, known as the [[baculum]].   

When the male achieves penetration, he will often hold tighter and thrust faster, and it is at this point when he is mating that the male's penis expands. Canine reproduction is different from human [[sexual intercourse]], because human males become erect first, and then enter the female; canine males enter first, then swell and become erect.   

The male dog has a [[bulbus glandis]], a spherical area of [[erectile tissue]] at the base of the [[penis]], which traps the penis inside the female's [[vagina]] during copulation as it becomes engorged with blood. [http://arbl.cvmbs.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/reprod/semeneval/dog.html]   

Once the penis is locked into the vagina by the bulbus glandis, the male will usually lift a leg and swing it over the female's back while turning around. The two stand with their hind ends touching and the penis locked inside the vagina while [[ejaculation]] occurs, decreasing leakage of [[semen]] from the vagina. After some time, typically 5 - 20 minutes (but sometimes longer), the bulbus glandis disengorges, allowing the mates to separate. [[Virginity|Virgin]] dogs can become quite distressed at finding themselves unable to separate during their first copulation, and may try to pull away or run. Dog breeders' websites often suggest it is appropriate for those involved to help calm and settle the mating dogs once this stage is reached, if they show anxiety, through until eventual separation.

Note that similar canine mounting behavior (sometimes with pelvic thrusting) is also used by [[dominance (biology)|dominant]] canines of both sexes. Dominance mounting, with or without thrusting, should not be confused with copulatory mounting, in which the thrusting is short term until a "tie" is achieved.

===Gestation and litters===
[[Image:CatahoulaLitter wb.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Catahoula Leopard Dog|Catahoula Leopard]] mother nursing her litter of puppies.]]
Dogs bear their litters roughly 9 weeks after [[fertilization]], although the length of gestation can vary from 56 to 72 days. A general rule of thumb is that a mammal will produce half as many offspring as the number of teats on the mother. This rule is altered in domesticated animals since larger litters are often favoured for economic reasons and in dogs, particularly, the great range of sizes and shapes plays a role in how many healthy puppies a female can carry. An average litter consists of about six '''[[puppy|puppies]]''', though this number may vary widely based on the breed of dog. [[Toy dog]]s generally produce from one to four puppies in each litter, while much larger breeds may average as many as 12 pups in each litter. The number of puppies also varies with the mother's age and health, the father's sperm count, the timing of the breeding, and many other factors.

Some breeds have been developed to emphasize certain physical traits beyond the point at which they can safely bear litters on their own. For example, the [[Bulldog]] often requires [[artificial insemination]] and almost always requires [[cesarean section]] for giving birth. Since a mother can provide nutrients and care to only a limited number of offspring, humans must assist in the care and feeding when the litter exceeds approximately eight puppies.

==Spaying and neutering==
{{main|Spaying and neutering}}
{{sectNPOV}}
Spaying (females only) and neutering (both genders but more usually males) refers to the [[sterilization]] of animals, usually by removal of the male's [[testicle]]s or the female's [[ovary|ovaries]] and [[uterus]], in order to eliminate the ability to procreate, and reduce sex drive. Neutering has also been known to reduce aggression in male dogs, but can occasionally increase aggression in female dogs.

Animal control agencies in the United States and the [[ASPCA]] advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be spayed or neutered so that they do not have undesired puppies. In the less developed countries of Europe, spaying or neutering of dogs is less common, and owners are usually instead advised to keep their dogs on leash and under supervision to avoid unwanted matings; drugs are used to prevent pregnancy and abort unwanted litters. {{Fact|date=January 2007}}

Because of the overpopulation of dogs in some countries, puppies born to strays or as the result of accidental breedings often end up being killed in animal shelters. Spaying and neutering can also decrease the risk of hormone-driven diseases such as mammary cancer, as well as undesired hormone-driven behaviors. The hormonal changes involved with sterilization are likely to somewhat change the animal's personality, however, and some object to spaying and neutering as the sterilization could be carried out without the excision of organs.

Contrary to myth, it is not required for a female dog to either experience a heat cycle or have puppies before spaying, and likewise, a male dog does not need the experience of mating before neutering; these myths are responsible for numerous unnecessary health problems and unwanted puppies. Female dogs spayed before their first heat have a vastly lower incidence of mammary tumors than dogs which are spayed after their first heat or pregnancy (1% verses 22%). A female dog can become pregnant on her first heat cycle (which can take place as early as six months), and should be kept away from intact male dogs, including littermates, over the age of 4 months.

Gender-preservative surgeries such as vasectomy and tubal ligation are possible, but do not appear to be popular due to the continuation of gender-specific behaviors and disease risks.

==Overpopulation==
According to the Humane Society of the United States, 3-4 million dogs and cats are [[euthanasia|euthanized]] each year in the United States and many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes. Spaying or neutering dogs helps keep overpopulation down.<Ref>

Local humane societies, SPCA's and other animal protection organizations urge people to spay or neuter their pets and to adopt animals from shelters instead of purchasing them. Several notable public figures have spoken out against animal over population, including [[Bob Barker#Animal rights|Bob Barker]]. On his [[game show]], [[The Price is Right]], Barker stressed the issue at the end of every episode, saying: "Help control the pet population. Have your pets spayed or neutered."

==Dog health==
{{main|Dog health}}
{{further|[[:Category:Dog health]]}}

Dogs are susceptible to various diseases, ailments, and poisons, some of which affect humans in the same way, others of which are unique to dogs. Dogs, like all mammals, are also susceptible to heat exhaustion when dealing with high levels of humidity and/or extreme temperatures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.dasnr.okstate.edu/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=257&Itemid=103 |title=Summer heat can be tough on pets |accessdate=2006-08-21 | first = Trisha | last = Gedon | date = 2006-05-25 | work = Division of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources | publisher = Oklahoma State University }}</ref>

===Diseases===	 
Infectious diseases commonly associated with dogs include [[rabies]] (hydrophobia), [[canine parvovirus]], and [[canine distemper]]. Congenital diseases of dogs can include a wide range from [[hip dysplasia]] and [[medial patellar]] [[luxation]] to [[epilepsy]] and [[pulmonic stenosis]]. Canines can get just about anything a human can get (excluding many infections which are species specific) like hypothyroidism, cancer, dental disease, heart disease, etc. 

Two serious medical conditions affecting dogs are [[pyometra]], affecting [[spay and neuter|unspayed]] females of all types and ages, and [[bloat]], which affects the larger breeds or deep chested dogs. Both of these are [[acute]] conditions, and can kill rapidly; owners of dogs which may be at risk should learn about such conditions as part of good animal care.

===Parasites===	 
Common external parasites are various species of [[flea]]s, [[tick]]s, and [[mites]]. Internal parasites include [[hookworm]]s, [[tapeworm]]s, [[roundworm]]s, and [[heartworms]]. See also [[CVBD]] (Canine Vector-Borne Diseases).

===Common physical disorders===	 
Some breeds of dogs are also prone to certain genetic ailments, such as [[hip dysplasia]], [[luxating patella]]s, [[cleft palate]], [[blindness]], or [[hearing impairment|deafness]]. Dogs are also susceptible to the same ailments that humans are, including [[Diabetes in cats and dogs|diabetes]], [[epilepsy]], [[cancer]], and [[arthritis]]. [[Gastric torsion]] and [[bloat]] is a dangerous problem in some large-chested breeds.

===Lifespan===
{{main|Dog years}}
The typical lifespan of dogs varies considerably by breed. For example, many giant dog breeds (such as [[Great Danes]]) average only 7 or 8 years, while some small terrier breeds, or [[toy breeds]] might live as long as 20 or above. The average lifespan for mixed-breed and midsize dogs is about 13 to 14 years. The longest-lived dog with reliable documentation died at 29 years and 27 days, the breed of the dog was an [[Australian cattle dog]] and it lived in [[Virginia]], [[USA]], the date of death was in 1939. The oldest currently living dog is from [[Canberra, Australia]] and is now 27 years old. Although the lifespans of all living species are mostly uncontrollable, one can significantly extend a dog's life by feeding it the right kinds of foods, giving it regular exercise, treating its diseases, and caring for its special needs and giving it love and comfort.

==Behavior==
:''For details, see [[:Category:Dog training and behavior]].''

Dogs are very social animals, but their personality and behavior vary with breed as well as how they are treated by their owners and others who come in contact with them. Physical abuse and starvation can produce very neurotic, dangerous dogs, and even simply failing to socialize them properly may entail maladaptive behaviors. {{fact}} It is not uncommon for dogs to [[dog attack|attack]] humans and other animals; however, this is usually because of lack of care or improper upbringing by its owner.

===Laughter in dogs=== 
Laughter might not be confined or unique to humans, despite Aristotle's observation that "only the human animal laughs".  The differences between chimpanzee and human laughter may be the result of adaptations that have evolved to enable human speech. However, some behavioural psychologists argue that self-awareness of one's situation, or the ability to identify with somebody else's predicament, are prerequisites for laughter, so animals are not really laughing in the same way that we do.

The dog-laugh sounds similar to a normal pant.  However by analyzing the pant using a spectrograph, this pant varies with bursts of frequencies, resulting in a laugh. When this recorded dog-laugh vocalization is played to dogs in a shelter setting, it can initiate play, promote pro-social behavior, and decrease stress levels.  In a study by Simonet, Versteeg, and Storie, one hundred and twenty subject dogs residing in a mid-size county animal shelter were observed.  Dogs ranging from 4 months to 10 years of age were compared with and without exposure to a dog-laugh recording.  The stress behaviors measured included panting, growling, salivating, pacing, barking, cowering, lunging, play-bows, sitting, orienting and lying down.  The study resulted in positive findings when exposed to the dog laughing resulted in the following:   significantly reduced stress behaviors, increased tail wagging and the display of a play-face when playing was initiated, and the increase of pro-social behavior such as approaching and lip licking were more frequent.  This research suggests exposure to dog-laugh vocalizations can calm and possibly increase shelter adoptions.

==Dog communication==
''Main article: [[Dog communication]]''
Dog communication comes in a variety of forms. Dogs use certain movements of their [[body|bodies]] and body parts and different [[vocalization]]s to send signals to other dogs, [[animal]]s and [[human]]s. There are a number of basic ways a dog can communicate. These are movements of the [[ear]]s, [[eye]]s and "[[eyebrow]]s", [[mouth]], [[head (anatomy)|head]], [[tail]], and entire body, as well as [[bark (dog)|bark]]s, [[growling|growl]]s, [[whining|whine]]s and [[whimper]]s, and [[howl (sound)|howl]]s. 

===Interpreting animal body language===
It is important to note that while many gestures and actions have common, [[stereotype|stereotypical]] meanings, researchers regularly seem to find that animal communication is often more complex and subtle than previously believed, and that the same gesture may have multiple distinct meanings depending on context and other behaviors. So generalizations such as "X means Y" are ''often'', but not ''always'' accurate. For example, even a simple tail wag may (depending on context) convey many meanings including:
* Excitement
* Anticipation
* Playfulness
* Contentment/enjoyment
* Happy self-confidence
But also:
* Anxiety
* Questioning another animal or a human as to intentions
* Tentative role assessment on meeting another animal
* Reassurance ("I'm hoping to be friendly, are you?")
* Uncertainty/apprehension
* Submissive placation (if worried by a more dominant animal)
Combined with other body language, in a specific context, many gestures such as yawns, direction of vision, and so on all convey meaning. Panting may mean "Too hot"; it might also mean either emotional anxiety or happiness too. Thus statements that a particular action "means" something should always be interpreted to mean "often means" something. As with human beings, who may smile or hug or stand a particular way for multiple reasons, many animals reuse gestures too. 

Descriptions in this article are therefore best viewed as common generalizations, to which a more experienced observer will be able to add further detail or understanding.

[[Ethology]] is a science which studies animal behavior.

=== Dominance and submission === 

One of the most common communications between dogs, and from dogs to their human companions, is the display of either [[dominance (biology)|dominance]] or [[submission]].
Most dogs and wild canines live in groups, or [[pack (canine)|pack]]s, with an established [[hierarchy]]. Dogs will, usually, submit to any dog that is more dominant than they are. There are innumerable ways a dog can show their dominance or submission, depending on situation, the amount of difference in [[social rank]], and each dog's own [[personality]]. Dominant dogs are more confident, while submissive dogs are more [[insecure]]. Both of these traits show in almost every communication signal a dog gives.

=== Body movements ===
:''See also'' [[Wolf#Body language|Wolf body language]]

=== Tail ===

How high or low the tail is held, in relation to how the dog's [[dog breed|breed]] naturally carries their tail, and how it is moved can signify the dog's [[mood]] and/or rank. The higher the tail is carried, the more dominant/confident the dog is; the lower, the more submissive/insecure. A tail held straight up, or even slightly curved over the back, shows that the dog is very dominant. If the fur on the tail is also bristled, the dog is saying they are willing and able to defend their position. 

Small, slow wags of the tail says the dog is questioning things around them. Either they aren't sure if the target dog or person is friendly, or they aren't sure what is going on or what is expected of them.

Large, fast wags of the tail is a sign of a happy or excited dog. If the wags are large enough to pull the dog's hips with them, the message includes a bit of submission to someone they view as pack leader.

Dogs with [[Docking (animals)|docked]] tails, like [[Dobermann]]s, tend to have some problems communicating with other dogs, since their tail movements are extremely difficult to detect.

=== Ears ===

Ear position relates the dog's level of attention, and reaction, to a situation or animal. Erect ears facing forward means the dog is very attentive, while ears laid back suggests a negative, usually fearful, reaction. Dogs with drop ears, like [[Beagle]]s, can't use these signals very well, as the signals first developed in [[wolf|wolves]], whose ears are pricked. Wolf-like dogs will, when content and happy, often hold their ears in a horizontal position but still forward. This has been referred to as the "Wolf Smile"

=== Mouth ===

Mouth expressions can provide information about the dog's mood. When a dog wants to be left alone, he might yawn (although yawning also might indicate sleepiness, confusion, or stress) or start licking his mouth without the presence of any food. When a dog is happy or wants to play, he might  pant with lips relaxed, covering the teeth and with what sometimes appears to be a happy expression (it might appear as a smile to some observers) or with the mouth open. Mouth expressions that indicate aggression include the snarl, with lips retracting to expose the teeth, although some dogs also use this during play. 

It's important to look at the dog's whole body and not just the mouth or tail before deciding what the dog is trying to communicate. What appears initially as aggression might be an invitation to play, or [[vice-versa]].

=== Eyes and eyebrows ===

While dogs don't have actual eyebrows, they do have a distictive ridge above their eyes, and some breeds, like the [[Rottweiler]] and the [[German Shepherd]], have markings there. A dog's eyebrow movements usually express a similar emotion to that of a human's eyebrow movements. Raised eyebrows suggest interest, lowered brows suggest confusion or mild anger, and one eyebrow up suggests bewilderment. Slitted eyes translate the same as human's also: suspicion or anger.

=== Feet and Legs ===

Although a dog's feet cannot manipulate like human hands, a person can use them as an avenue of communication. A dog might stamp its feet, alternating its left and right front legs, while its back legs are still. This occurs when the dog is excited, wants something, or wants its owner's attention. Pointers tend to tuck one front leg up, when they sense [[Game (food)|game]] nearby. This behavior might not be communication so much as the dog freezing mid-step as a result of the dog's instinct telling the dog to immediately still. It is also common for dogs to paw or scratch for objects they desire. Many dogs are trained to mimic a human handshake, offering a paw to a human stooping down and offering their own hand in exchange.

=== Head ===
[[Image:Giggles.png|thumb|right|260px|An unstressed dog in typical posture allows its tongue to loll out of its mouth.  Note the squinted eyes, as the owner was praising him for sitting still for the picture.]]

A dog's ability to make facial gestures is not as refined as a human's.  However, they can wrinkle or straighten their forehead to show confusion or determination, and when puzzled or curious, will often raise their eyelids and tilt their head to one side. 

A dog's eyes widen when playful and unthreatned.  Some dogs squint their eyes when they are praised.  When afraid, a dog's pupils typically dilate.  Most dogs avoid intimate eye contact, seemingly to avoid confrontation.  But when angered or preparing for self-defense, a dog's eyes will narrow and follow it's foe's moves carefully. When exhibiting aggressive bahavior, it is best to not look an unfamiliar dog in the eye, because it may interpret it as a challenge.

An unstressed dog in typical posture allows its tongue to loll out of its mouth.  When ''begging'', or when they are particularly happy, they may pull their lips back seemingly to smile. This pseudo-smile is normally only exhibited when interacting with people, perhaps a learned behavior from humans.  A dog showing tightly clenched teeth and wrinkled nose is likely to attack if further provoked.

Dogs have excellent hearing, and can position their ears advantageously for following sounds.  Dogs typically raise their ears when listening intently and when demonstrating compliance with commands.  When a dog's ears are pulled back, they may be showing submission, or fear.

=== Barking ===
{{main|Bark (dog)}}

Dogs bark for many reasons, such as when perceived intruders (humans, dogs, or other animals) approach its territory, for identification, when hearing an unfamiliar or unidentified noise, when seeing something that the dog doesn't expect to be there, or when playing. Barking also expresses different emotions for a dog, such as loneliness, fear, suspicion, stress, and pleasure. Play or excited barks are often short and sharp, such as when a dog is attempting to get a person or another dog to play. 

Dogs generally try to avoid conflict; their vocalizations are part of what communicates to other dogs whether they mean harm or are in a playful mood. 

The bark of a distressed or stressed dog is high pitched, atonal, and repetitive (and tends to get higher in pitch as the dog becomes more upset).  For example, a dog left home alone and who has separation anxiety might bark in such a way.
<!--  This info is true but it doesn't belong here; save for somewhere else (maybe training?) These dogs are trying to call their owners back home again and because they do eventually come back, the dog thinks that the barking was why they came back and doesn't realize that the owner was to far to hear them or that the human don't understand it. -->

Some research has suggested that dogs have separate barks for different animals, including dog, fox, deer, human and cat.

=== Growls ===
{{main|Growling}}
Growls can be used to threaten, to invite play, and to show dominance. Growling should be watched with special attention because it can indicate dominance or aggression. A soft, low-pitched growl often indicates aggression; the dog may feel threatened and may be provoked to attack. An intense growl, without showing any teeth, may often indicate a playful attitude. Always consider the context of a growl, and exercise caution.

=== Whines and whimpers ===
Dogs whine and whimper to show that they are in pain or are afraid, but also when excited, such as when greeting another dog, or in anticipation of a treat or an outing. Some dogs may use whining as a means of getting attention. <!-- see note above...  because each time it whines it gets a humans attention and therefor learns they can get their way. It's important if your dogs does this to stop giving it attention each time the dog whines for attention because it may multiply into bigger problems later on. -->

=== Howls ===
Howling provides long-range communication with other dogs or owners. Howling can be used to locate another pack member, to keep strangers away, or to call the pack for hunting. Sometimes dogs howl in response to high-pitched or loud noises such as alarms, sirens, music, or singing. In [[Russia]], a howling dog represents a bad sign, for it is believed that howling dogs sense somebody's death somewhere in the vicinity. Sometimes dogs howl when trains are honking or a [[Civil defense siren]] is going off. The latter in particular is a source of humor for many dog-owners.

=== Human speech ===
Often undiscussed, some dogs may try to mimic human speech, or are trained to.  This ability does not appear to be limited to any particular breed, though to quote trainer A.J. Haggerty "Generally, dogs that have a brachycephalic head <U+2014> a wide head with a short muzzle <U+2014> like the Bulldog, are good candidates for talking.  They have cavernous mouths that make it easier for them to produce rounder sounds.  I have found that Rottweilers are among the best talkers, because of the shape of their heads, and the fact that they have a high energy level. Terriers can also be good talkers, because they<U+2019>re high energy dogs." Most recent examples have included a talking pug on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. This kind of vocalization does not have a set meaning, and is unique to its situation.

==Ancestry and history of domestication==
{{Mergeto|Origin of the domestic dog|date=January 2007}}
{{main|Origin of the domestic dog}}
[[Image:DogMosaic wb.jpg|thumb|This ancient mosaic, likely Roman, shows a large dog with a collar hunting a lion.]]
[[Molecular systematics]] indicate that the domestic dog (''Canis lupus familiaris'') descends from one or more populations of wild wolves (''Canis lupus''). As reflected in the [[nomenclature]], dogs are descended from the wolf and are able to interbreed with wolves.

The relationship between human and canine has deep roots. [[Wolf]] remains have been found in association with [[Hominidae|hominid]] remains dating from 400,000 years ago. Converging archaeological and genetic evidence indicate a time of [[domestication]] in the late [[Upper Paleolithic]] close to the [[Pleistocene]]/[[Holocene]] boundary, between 17,000 and 14,000 years ago. [[Fossil]] bone morphologies and genetic analysis of current and ancient dog and wolf populations have not yet been able to conclusively determine whether all dogs descend from a single domestication event, or whether dogs were domesticated independently in more than one location. Domesticated dogs may have interbred with local populations of wild wolves on several occasions (so-called introgression).

The earliest dog fossils, two [[skull|crania]] from [[Russia]] and a [[mandible]] from [[Germany]], date from 13,000 to 17,000 years ago. Their likely ancestor is the large northern [[Holarctic]] wolf, ''Canis lupus lupus''. Remains of smaller dogs from [[Mesolithic]] ([[Natufian]]) cave deposits in the [[Middle East]], dated to around 12,000 years ago, have been interpreted as descendants of a lighter Southwest Asian wolf, ''Canis lupus arabs''. [[Rock art]] and skeletal remains indicate that by 14,000 years ago, dogs were present from [[North Africa]] across [[Eurasia]] to [[North America]]. Dog burials at the [[Mesolithic]] cemetery of [[Svaerdborg]] in Denmark suggest that in ancient Europe dogs were valued companions.

Genetic analyses have so far yielded divergent results. Vil<U+00E0>, Savolainen, and colleagues (1997) concluded that dogs split off from wolves between 75,000 and 135,000 years ago, while a subsequent analysis by Savolainen et al. (2002) indicated a "common origin from a single gene pool for all dog populations" between 40,000 and 15,000 years ago in [[East Asia]]. Verginelli et al. (2005), however, suggest both sets of dates must be reevaluated in light of recent findings showing that poorly calibrated molecular clocks have systematically overestimated the age of geologically recent events. On balance, and in agreement with the archaeological evidence, 15,000 years ago is the most likely time for the wolf-dog divergence.

Verginelli examined ancient [[DNA]] evidence from five prehistoric Italian [[canids]] carbon-dated to between 15,000 and 3,000 years old, 341 wolves from several populations worldwide, and 547 purebred dogs. Their results indicate multiple independent origins of dogs and/or of frequent interbreeding between early proto-dogs and wolves throughout a vast geographic range. The detailed history remains unexplored and until further evidence is available, the following section on wolf ancestors must be considered purely speculative.

===Wolf ancestors===
Although all wolves belong to the species ''[[Gray Wolf|Canis lupus]]'', there are (or were) many subspecies that had developed a distinctive appearance, social structure, and other traits. For example, the [[Japanese Wolf]] and the [[Eastern Timber Wolf]] possess different distinctive coloration, hunting and social structures. The origin of the dog is so ancient and so worldwide that many varieties of wolf played a part in it. It is wrong to say that dogs descended from modern wolves. They descended from ancestral wolves, and this difference must always be kept in mind. Ancestral wolves of many varieties existed all over the world. Humans are of a tropical origin, and it was there that the domestication of dogs from wolves first took place. It follows then, that the first wolves to be domesticated were the warm-climate, short-haired varieties that gave rise to many of our dog breeds, with the long-haired, northern wolves giving rise to our northern breeds when humans reached these latitudes. 

The [[Indian Wolf]] is thought to have contributed to the development of more breeds of dogs than other subspecies. Many of today's wild dogs, such as the [[dingo]] and the [[pariah dog]]s, are descended from this wolf.  The Indian Wolf is also thought to have bred with descendants of the European wolf to create the [[Mastiff]]s and eventually leading to the development of such diverse breeds as the [[Pug]], the [[St. Bernard (dog)|Saint Bernard]], and the [[Bloodhound]]. The [[Tibetan Mastiff]] is an example of an ancient breed.

The [[Gray Wolf|European wolf]], in turn, may have contributed many of its attributes to the [[Spitz]] dog types, most [[terrier]]s, and many of today's [[sheepdog]]s. The [[Chinese wolf]] is probably ancestor to the [[Pekingese]] and toy [[spaniel]]s, although it is also probable that descendants of the Chinese and European wolves encountered each other over the millennia, contributing to many of the oriental [[toy dog|toy]] breeds.

The [[Eastern Timber Wolf]] is a direct ancestor to most, if not all, of the North American northern [[sled dog]] types. This interbreeding still occurs with dogs living in the [[Arctic]] region, where the attributes of the wolf that enable survival in a hostile environment are valued by humans. Additionally, unintentional crossbreeding occurs simply because dogs and wolves live in the same environment. The general [[reproductive isolation]] which is required to define dogs and wolves as separate species is purely a result of lack of opportunity, stemming from a general mutual unfamiliarity, suspicion, mistrust, and fear.

The [[phenotype|phenotypic]] characteristics that distinguish a wolf from a dog are tenuous. Wolves typically have a "brush tail" and erect ears. While some dog breeds possess one of these characteristics, they rarely possess both.

===Speed of domestication===
Current research indicates that domestication, or the attributes of a domesticated animal, can occur much more quickly <ref>http://www.amsci.org/amsci/articles/99articles/Trut.html#26879</ref>{{fact}},<!--Cited item does not support the statement to which it is attached--> than previously believed. Domestication of a wild dog may occur within one or two human generations with deliberate [[selective breeding]]. It is also now generally believed that initial domestication was through mutual desire. Wild canines who scavenged around human habitations received more food than their more skittish or fearful counterparts. Canines who attacked people or their children were likely killed or driven away, while those more friendly animals survived. Canines would have been beneficial by chasing away other [[vermin]] or [[scavengers]]. With their sharp senses, they would also be valuable as an alarm against marauding predators. The relationship is theorized to have developed in this way.

==Dog meat for human consumption==  	
{{Main article|Dog meat}}

In some countries, certain dog breeds, apart from being kept as pets, are raised on farms and slaughtered for consumption. In countries where dogs are particularly popular as household pets, consumption of dogs is generally taboo and considered an abhorrent cultural practice<!-- This seems a tautology. Can anyone tell me the difference between "taboo" and something "considered an abhorrent cultural practice"?-->, but there are exceptions, such as [[Vietnam]], where dogs are popular as pets and as meat.<ref>{{cite web

Although the Chinese were the first to domesticate the dog and keep them as pets, dog meat has been a source of food in China from at least the time of Confucius, and possibly even before. Ancient writings from the Zhou Dynasty referred to the 'three beasts' (which were bred for food), including pig, goat, and dog. Mencius, the philosopher, recommended dog as the tastiest of all meats. In most other countries such as countries in the Western world, eating dog meat is strongly frowned upon, and illegal, as it is with cats.

==Dog abuse==	 
{{main|Cruelty to animals}}
Cruelty to dogs refers to treatment that causes unacceptable suffering or [[harm]]. What qualifies as unacceptable suffering varies among countries and cultures. Cruelty can be passive, typified by simple neglect, or active, with malicious intent.<Ref>

''Main artcile: [[List of famous dogs|Famous dogs]]''

In the long shared history of dogs and humans, there have beenn many [[List of famous dogs|famous]], and notorious, dogs, and many [[list of fictional dogs|fictional dogs]] have been featured in literature, cinema, and other media.

==Dog breeds==

[[Image:Roodog2k-ivan-and-boxer.JPG|thumb|The dog has developed into hundreds of breeds with a great degree of variation, such as this [[Miniature Pinscher]] and [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]].]]
There are numerous [[dog breed]]s, with [[List of dog breeds|over 800]] being recognized by various [[kennel club]]s worldwide. As all dog breeds have been derived from mixed-breed dog populations, the term "purebred" has meaning only with respect to a certain number of generations. Many dogs, especially outside the United States of America and Western Europe, belong to no recognized breed.

A few basic [[:Category:Dog types|breed types]] have evolved gradually during the domesticated dog's relationship with man over the last 10,000 or more years, but most modern breeds are of relatively recent derivation. Many of these are the product of a deliberate process of [[artificial selection]]. Because of this, some breeds are highly specialized, and there is extraordinary morphological diversity across different breeds. Despite these differences, dogs are able to distinguish dogs from other kinds of animal.

The definition of a dog breed is a matter of some controversy. Depending on the size of the original founding population, closed gene pool breeds can have problems with inbreeding, specifically due to [[founder effect]]. Dog breeders are increasingly aware of the importance of population genetics and of maintaining diverse gene pools. Health testing and new DNA tests can help avoid problems, by providing a replacement for natural selection. Without selection, inbreeding and closed gene pools can increase the risk of severe health or behavioural problems. Some organizations define a breed more loosely, such that an individual may be considered of one breed as long as 75% of its parentage is of that breed. These considerations affect both pets and the show dogs entered in [[conformation show|dog shows]]. Even prize-winning [[purebred]] dogs sometimes possess crippling [[Genetic disorder|genetic defects]] due to founder effect or [[inbreeding]].<ref>{{cite book

[[Image:Staffordshire Bull Terrier - Labrador Cross.JPG|right|thumb|200px|A 10-year-old [[Staffordshire Bull Terrier]]/[[Labrador Retriever|Labrador]].]]

In February 2004, the Canine Studies Institute in [[Aurora, Ohio]], arranged recognized breeds of dogs into ten categories. 

[[Mixed-breed dog]]s or [[Mongrel]]s are dogs that do not belong to specific breeds, being mixtures of two or more in variant percentages. Mixed breeds, or dogs with no purebred ancestry, are not inherently "better" or "worse" than purebred dogs as companions, [[pet]]s, [[working dog]]s, or competitors in [[dog sports]]. Sometimes mixed-breed dogs are deliberately bred, for example, the Cockapoo, a mixture of Cocker Spaniel and Miniature [[Poodle]]. Such deliberate crosses may display [[hybrid vigor]] and other desirable traits, but can also lack one or more of the desired traits of their parents, such as temperament or a particular color or coat. However, without genetic testing of the parents, the crosses can sometimes end up inheriting genetic defects that occur in both parental breeds. Deliberately crossing two or more breeds is also a manner of establishing new breeds.

===Neoteny in the rapid evolution of diverse dog breeds===
{{Mergeto|Origin of the domestic dog|date=January 2007}}
This rapid evolution of dogs from wolves is an example of [[neoteny]] or [[pedomorphosis|paedomorphism]]. As with many species, the young wolves are more social and less [[dominant]] than adults; therefore, the selection for these characteristics, whether deliberate or inadvertent, is more likely to result in a simple retention of juvenile characteristics into adulthood than to generate a complex of independent new changes in behavior. (This is true of many domesticated animals, including humans themselves, who have many characteristics similar to young [[bonobo]]s.) This paedomorphic selection naturally results in a retention of juvenile physical characteristics as well. Compared to wolves, many adult dog breeds retain such juvenile characteristics as soft fuzzy fur, round torsos, large heads and eyes, ears that hang down rather than stand erect, etc.; characteristics which are shared by most juvenile [[mammal]]s, and therefore generally elicit some degree of protective and nurturing behavior cross-species from most adult mammals, including humans, who term such characteristics "cute" or "appealing".

The example of canine neoteny goes even further, in that the various breeds are differently neotenized according to the type of behavior that was selected.[http://books.google.com/books?id=_kOoVw0SIhUC&pg=PA394&lpg=PA394&vq=neotenous+behavior&dq=%22Gould%22+%22Eight+Little+Piggies:+Reflections+in+Natural+History%22+&sig=Q1iF36A6ieMKgh3eRAtSeDKTydQ Stephen Jay Gould; Eight Little Piggies: Reflections in Natural History; W. W. Norton & Company, 1993; pp. 394] 

*[[Livestock guardian dog]]s exhibit the controlled characteristics of hunting dogs. Members of this group, such as [[Border Collie]]s, [[Belgian Shepherd Dog (Malinois)|Belgian Malinois]] and [[German Shepherd]]s use tactics of hunter and prey to intimidate and keep control of herds and flocks. Their natural instinct to bring down an animal under their charge is muted by training. Other members of the group, including [[Welsh Corgi]]s, [[Canaan dog]]s, and [[Cattle dog]]s herd with a more aggressive demeanor and make use of body design to elude the defences of their charges.
* [[Gun dog]] breeds used in hunting&mdash;that is, [[pointer (dog)|pointers]], [[setter]]s, [[spaniel]]s, and [[retriever]]s&mdash;have an intermediate degree of paedomorphism; they are at the point where they share in the pack's hunting behavior, but are still in a junior role, not participating in the actual attack. They identify potential prey and freeze into immobility, for instance, but refrain from then stalking the prey as an adult predator would do next; this results in the "pointing" behavior for which such dogs are bred. Similarly, they seize dead or wounded prey and bring it back to the "pack", even though they did not attack it themselves, that is, "retrieving" behavior. Their physical characteristics are closer to that of the mature wild canine than the sheepdog breeds, but they typically do not have erect ears, etc.
* [[Scenthound]]s maintain an intermediate body type and behavior pattern that causes them to actually pursue prey by tracking their scent, but tend to refrain from actual individual attacks in favor of vocally summoning the pack leaders (in this case, humans) to do the job. They often have a characteristic vocalization called a bay. Some examples are the Beagle, Bloodhound, Basset Hound, Coonhound, Dachshund, Fox Hound, Otter Hound, and Harrier.
* [[Sighthound]]s, who pursue and attack perceived prey on sight, maintain the mature canine size and some features, such as narrow chest and lean bodies, but have largely lost the erect ears of the wolf and thick double layered coats.  Some examples are the Afghan, Borzoi, Saluki, Sloughi, Pharaoh Hound, Azawakh, Whippet, and Greyhound.
* [[Mastiff]]-types are large dogs, both tall and massive with barrel-like chests, large bones, and thick skulls.  They have traditionally been bred for war, protection, and guardian work.
* [[Bulldog]]-types are medium sized dogs bred for combat against both wild and domesticated animals. These dogs have a massive, square skull and large bones with an extremely muscular build and broad shoulders.
* [[Terrier]]s similarly have adult aggressive behavior, famously coupled with a lack of juvenile submission, and display correspondingly adult physical features such as erect ears, although many breeds have also been selected for size and sometimes [[achondroplasia|dwarfed legs]] to enable them to pursue prey in their burrows.

The least paedomorphic behavior pattern may be that of the [[basenji]], bred in [[Africa]] to hunt alongside humans almost on a peer basis; this breed is often described as highly independent, neither needing nor appreciating a great deal of human attention or nurturing, often described as "catlike" in its behavior. It too has the body plan of an adult canine predator.
Of course, dogs in general possess a significant ability to modify their behavior according to experience, including adapting to the behavior of their "pack leaders"&mdash;again, humans. This allows them to be trained to behave in a way that is not specifically the most natural to their breed; nevertheless, the accumulated experience of thousands of years shows that some combinations of nature and nurture are quite daunting, for instance, training [[whippet]]s to guard flocks of sheep.

===Breed popularity===
Breed popularity varies widely over time<Ref>

and in different parts of the world and different segments of the population. Counting by [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) registration (not by [[dog licence|licensing registration]] or by [[United Kennel Club]] (UKC) registration, which could present different statistics), the [[Labrador Retriever]] has been the United States's most commonly registered breed of dog since 1991. <Ref>

However, even within parts of the United States, popularity varies; for example, in 2005 the most-registered breed in New York City was the [[Poodle]] while the [[Yorkshire Terrier]] was the second-most-registered breed in [[Houston]]. <Ref>

However, animal shelters in many parts of the United States report that the most-commonly available dog for adoption is the [[American Pit Bull Terrier]] or pit bull-type mixes, making up as much as 20% of dogs available for adoption, none of which would be registered with the AKC.<ref>http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=cruelty_pitbull</ref> Two decades ago, in 1983, the AKC's top two registered breeds were the [[American Cocker Spaniel]] and the [[Poodle]].<ref>{{cite book|title=World Almanac and Book of Facts|year=1985|publisher=Newspaper Enterprise Association (Doubleday)}}</ref>

In [[Britain]], [[The Kennel Club]] reports that the most-registered breed from at least 1999 to 2005 was the Labrador Retriever. It rounds out the top three for 1999 to 2005 with the [[German Shepherd Dog]], also popular in the States, and the [[English Cocker Spaniel]]<Ref>
