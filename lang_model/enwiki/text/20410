The '''Diolkos'''&mdash;from the Greek ''dia'' (across) and ''holkos'' (portage)&mdash;was a paved trackway in [[Ancient Greece]] which enabled boats to be moved overland across the [[Isthmus of Corinth]]. The {{convert|6|km|mi|1}} to {{convert|8.5|km|mi|1}} long roadway was a rudimentary form of [[railway]],<ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 8 & 15"/> and operated from ca. 600 BC until the middle of the 1st century AD.<ref name="Verdelis, Nikolaos (1957), 526"/><ref name="Cook, R. M. (1979), 152"/><ref name="Drijvers, J.W. (1992), 75"/><ref name="Raepsaet, G. & Tolley, M. (1993), 256"/><ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 11"/>

== Function ==
The ''Diolkos'' saved ships sailing from the [[Ionian Sea]] to the [[Aegean Sea]] a dangerous sea journey round the [[Peloponnese]] peninsula, whose three headlands had a reputation for gales, especially [[Cape Matapan]] and [[Cape Malea]].<ref name="Drijvers, J.W. (1992), 75"/><ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 10"/><ref name="Werner, Walter (1997), 98"/> By contrast, both the [[Gulf of Corinth]] and the [[Saronic Gulf]] were relatively sheltered waters. In addition, the overland passage of the Isthmus, a neck of land {{convert|6.4|km|mi|1}} wide at its narrowest, offered a much shorter route to [[Athens]] for ships sailing to/from the Ionian coast of Greece.

== History ==
Ancient literature is silent on the date of the construction of the Diolkos. For [[Thucydides]] ([[460 BC]]&ndash;[[395 BC]]) the Diolkos already seemed to be something ancient.<ref>Werner, Walter: "The largest ship trackway in ancient times: the Diolkos of the Isthmus of Corinth, Greece, and early attempts to build a canal", ''The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology'', Vol. 26, No. 2 (1997), pp. 98&ndash;119 (99 & 112)</ref> Excavated letters and associated pottery found at the site indicate a construction date at the end of the [[7th century BC|7th]] or beginning of the [[6th century BC]], that is around the time when [[Periander]] was tyrant of [[Corinth]].<ref name=" Verdelis, Nikolaos (1957), 526">Verdelis, Nikolaos: "Le diolkos de L'Isthme", ''Bulletin de Correspondance Hell<U+00E9>nique'', Vol. 81 (1957), pp. 526&ndash;529 (526)</ref><ref name="Cook, R.

=== Role in warfare ===
The Diolkos played an important role in ancient naval warfare. Greek historians note several occasions from the [[5th century BC|5th]] to [[1st century BC]] when warships were hauled across the Isthmus in order to speed up naval campaigning.<ref name="note">Although the name of the Diolkos is not explicitly mentioned in these historical sources, its use on these occasions is generally assumed as the Diolkos existed earlier and was available later. (Cook, R. M. (1979), p. 152 (Fn. 7); MacDonald, Brian R. (1986), p. 192 (Fn. 6))</ref> In [[428 BC]], the [[History of Sparta|Spartans]] planned to transport their warships over the Diolkos to the Saronic Gulf to threaten [[Athens]],<ref>[[Thucydides]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Thuc.+3.15.1 <U+201C>A History of the Peloponnesian War<U+201D>, 3.15.1]</ref> while later in the Peloponnesian War they carted over a squadron heading quickly for operations at [[Chios]] ([[411 BC]]).<ref>[[Thucydides]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Thuc.+8.7.1 <U+201C>A History of the Peloponnesian War<U+201D>, 8.7&ndash;8]</ref> In [[220 BC]], [[Demetrius of Pharos]] had a fleet of about fifty vessels dragged across the Isthmus to the Bay of Corinth by his men.<ref>[[Polybius]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+4.19 "Histories", 4.19.77&ndash;79]</ref> Three years later, a [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] fleet of 38 vessels was sent across by [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]], while the larger warships sailed around Cape Malea.<ref>[[Polybius]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+5.101 "Histories", 5.101.4]</ref> After his victory at [[Battle of Actium|Actium]] ([[31 BC]]), [[Octavian]] advanced as fast as possible against [[Marc Antony]] by ordering part of his 260 [[Liburnian]]s to be carried over the Isthmus.<ref>Werner, Walter (1997), p. 113f.</ref> In [[868|AD 868]], the [[Byzantine]] admiral [[Niketas Oryphas]] had his whole fleet of one hundred [[dromon]]s dragged across the Isthmus in a quickly executed operation,<ref name="Werner, Walter (1997), 114">Werner, Walter (1997), p. 114</ref> but this took place most likely on a different route.<ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 12"/><ref name="Cook, R. M. (1979), 152 (Fn. 7)"/>

=== Role in commerce ===
Despite the frequent mentioning of the Diolkos in connection with military operations, modern scholarship assumes that the prime purpose of the trackway must have been the transport of cargo, considering that warships cannot have needed transporting very often, and ancient historiography was always more interested in war than commerce.<ref name="Cook, R. M. (1979), 152"/><ref name="MacDonald, Brian R. (1986), 192">MacDonald, Brian R.: "The Diolkos", ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'', Vol. 106 (1986), pp. 191-195 (192)</ref><ref name="Raepsaet, G. & Tolley, M. (1993) 235">Raepsaet, G. & Tolley, M. (1993), p. 235</ref><ref name="Werner, Walter (1997), 112">Werner, Walter (1997), p. 112</ref><ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 13">Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), p. 13</ref> Comments by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Strabo]] who described in times of peace the Diolkos as being in regular service also imply a commercial use of the trackway.<ref name="Cook, R. M. (1979), 152"/> Coinciding with the rise of [[Architecture of ancient Greece|monumental architecture in Greece]], the construction of the Diolkos may have initially served particularly for transporting heavy goods like [[marble]], [[monolith]]s and [[timber]] to points west and east.<ref name="MacDonald, Brian R. (1986), 193">MacDonald, Brian R. (1986), p. 193</ref><ref name="Raepsaet, G. & Tolley, M. (1993), 256"/><ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 14">Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), p. 14</ref> It is not known what tolls [[Corinth]] could extract from the Diolkos on its territory, but the fact that the trackway was used and maintained long after its construction, indicates that it remained for merchant ships an attractive alternative to the trip around Cape Malea for much of antiquity.<ref name="MacDonald, Brian R. (1986), 195">MacDonald, Brian R. (1986), p. 195</ref>

== Structure ==
=== Course ===
[[Image:Diolkos2.jpg|thumb|right|Mooring place]]

The Diolkos runs across the narrowest part of the Isthmus, where the trackway followed the local [[topography]] in a curved course in order to avoid steeper gradients.<ref name="Werner, Walter (1997), 109">Werner, Walter (1997), p. 109</ref> The roadway passes the Isthmus ridge at ca. {{convert|79|m|ft|0}} height with an average gradient of 1:70,<ref name="Werner, Walter (1997), 109"/> while the steepest sections rise up to 6%.<ref name="Raepsaet, G. & Tolley, M. (1993), 246">Raepsaet, G. & Tolley, M. (1993), p. 246</ref> Its total length is estimated at 6&ndash;7&nbsp;kilometres (3.7&ndash;4.3&nbsp;mi)<ref name="Raepsaet, G. & Tolley, M. (1993), 246"/>, {{convert|8|km|mi|0}} <ref name="Werner, Walter (1997), 109"/> or {{convert|8.5|km|mi|1}}<ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 10">Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), p. 10</ref> depending on the number of supposed bends taken into account. A total of {{convert|1100|m|ft|0}} has been archaeologically traced, mainly at its western end close to the bay of Corinth.<ref name="Werner, Walter (1997), 109"/> There the known trackway begins at a mooring place south of the canal, runs parallel to the waterway for a few hundred meters, after which it switches to the north side, running in a slight bend a similar distance along the canal.<ref>Raepsaet, G. & Tolley, M. (1993), p. 237&ndash;246</ref> From there on, the Diolkos either followed in a straight line the course of the modern canal,<ref>Raepsaet, G. & Tolley, M. (1993), p. 238 (Fig. 3)</ref> or swung south in a wide arc.<ref>Werner, Walter (1997), p. 108 (Fig. 16)</ref><ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 10"/> The roadway ended at the Saronic Gulf at the village Schoinos (today: [[Kalamaki]]) described by Strabo as eastern terminal.<ref name="Werner, Walter (1997), 109"/> Some sections of the Diolkos have been destroyed by the [[Corinth Canal|19th century canal]]<ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 10"/> or other modern installations.<ref name="Werner, Walter (1997), 106">Werner, Walter (1997), p. 106</ref>

=== Track and transport ===
[[Image:Boat Cdm Paris 322 n1.jpg|thumb|left|Image of a ship on Attic [[black-figure pottery]]. c.520 B.C. This is the sort of boat that the ''diolkos'' may have transported in [[Periander]]'s time.]]

The Diolkos was a trackway paved with hard [[limestone]]<ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 10"/> and parallel grooves running about {{convert|160|cm|in|0}} apart.<ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 12">Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), p. 12</ref> The roadway was {{convert|3.4|m|ft|1}} to {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} wide.<ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 10"/> Since ancient sources tell us little about how the ships were hauled across,<ref name="Werner, Walter (1997), 109">Werner, Walter (1997), p. 109</ref> the mode of ship transport has largely to be reconstructed from the archaeological evidence. The tracks indicate that transport on the Diolkos was done with some sort of wheeled vehicle.<ref name="Cook, R. M. (1979), 152"/><ref name="MacDonald, Brian R. (1986), 195"/><ref name="Werner, Walter (1997), 111">Werner, Walter (1997), p. 111</ref> Either vessel and cargo were hauled across on separate vehicles, or only the cargo was taken across and reloaded on a different ship at the other side of the Isthmus.<ref name="Cook, R. M. (1979), 153"> Cook, R. M. (1979), p. 153</ref><ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 14"/> It is assumed that the vessels were usually rather boats than ships,<ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 14"/><ref>Drijvers, J.W. (1992), pp. 76</ref> although a technical analysis has shown that the transport of [[Trireme]]s (35&nbsp;m (115&nbsp;ft) long, 5&nbsp;m (16&nbsp;ft) beam) was technically feasible,<ref>Raepsaet, G. & Tolley, M. (1993), p. 259&ndash;261</ref> but difficult.<ref>Werner, Walter (1997), p. 109 (Fig. 17)</ref> To prevent the danger of breaking the [[keel]] in middle during transport, ''hypozomata'' must have been used which were thick ropes running from [[Bow (ship)|bow]] to [[stern]] meant to reduce sagging and hogging of the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]].<ref name="Werner, Walter (1997), 111"/> Ship and cargo were presumbly pulled by men and animals with the help of [[rope]]s, [[Block and tackle|tackle]]s<ref name="Werner, Walter (1997), 112"/> and possibly also [[capstan]]s.<ref>Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), p. 12f.</ref>

=== Ancient railway ===
According to the [[United Kingdom|British]] historian of science M.J.T. Lewis, the Diolkos represented a [[railway]], in the basic sense of a prepared track which so guides the vehicles running on it that they cannot leave the track.<ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 8 & 15">Lewis, M. J. T., [http://www.sciencenews.gr/docs/diolkos.pdf "Railways in the Greek and Roman world"], in Guy, A. / Rees, J. (eds), ''Early Railways. A Selection of Papers from the First International Early Railways Conference'' (2001), pp. 8&ndash;19 (8 & 15)</ref> Measuring between {{convert|6|km|mi|0}} and {{convert|8.5|km|mi|1}},<ref name="Raepsaet, G. & Tolley, M. (1993), 246"/> <ref name="Werner, Walter (1997), 109"/><ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 10"/> remaining in regular and frequent service for at least 650&nbsp;years,<ref name=" Verdelis, Nikolaos (1957), 526"/><ref name="Cook, R. M. (1979), 152"/><ref name="Drijvers, J.W. (1992), 75"/><ref name="Raepsaet, G. & Tolley, M. (1993), 256"/><ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 11"/> and being open to all on payment, it constituted even a public railway, a concept which according to Lewis did not recur until around 1800.<ref>Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), p. 15</ref> Also, its average [[Rail gauge|gauge]] of around {{convert|160|cm|in|0}}<ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 12"/> is similar to modern standards. 

However, a close examination of the excavated tracks may give a more differentiated picture. While there is agreement that the grooves in the eastern part were cut deliberately into the stone slabs to guide cart wheels,<ref>Raepsaet, G. & Tolley, M. (1993), p. 243</ref><ref name="Werner, Walter (1997), 106"/> <ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 12"/> those in the western section are interpreted by some authors as a result of wear or do not appear at all.<ref>Raepsaet, G. & Tolley, M. (1993), pp. 237&ndash;243</ref><ref>Werner, Walter (1997), pp. 103&ndash;105</ref> On the other hand, the marked cambers of this road section may point at deliberate tracks as well.<ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 12"/> Generally, varying forms of the grooves can also be explained with the long time of operation of the trackway during which modifications and repairs must have significantly changed the appearance of the Diolkos.<ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 13"/>

=== Modern exploration ===
The chief engineer of the Corinth Canal [[B<U+00E9>la Gerster]] conducted extensive research on the topography of the Isthmus, but did not discover the Diolkos.<ref name="Raepsaet, G. & Tolley, M. (1993) 235"/> Remains of the ship trackway were probably first identified by the [[Germany|German]] archaeologist Lolling in the 1883 [[Baedeker]] edition.<ref name="Werner, Walter (1997), 98">Werner, Walter (1997), p. 98</ref> In 1913, J.G. Frazer reported in his commentary of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] on traces of an ancient trackway across the Isthmus,<ref>Raepsaet, G. & Tolley, M. (1993), p. 236</ref> while parts of the western quay were discovered by Fowler in 1932.<ref name="Werner, Walter (1997), 98"/>

Systematic excavations were finally undertaken by the Greek archaeologist Nikolaos Verdelis between 1956 and 1962,<ref>Verdelis, Nikolaos: "Le diolkos de L'Isthme", ''Bulletin de Correspondance Hell<U+00E9>nique'', (1957, 1958, 1960, 1961, 1963)</ref> who uncovered a more or less continuous stretch of {{convert|800|m|ft|0}} and traced about {{convert|1100|m|ft|0}} in all.<ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 10"/> Even though Verdelis<U+2019> excavation reports continue to provide the basis for modern interpretations, his premature passing prevented full publication, leaving many questions open concerning the exact nature of the structure.<ref>Raepsaet, G. & Tolley, M. (1993), p. 239</ref><ref name="Lewis, M. J. T. (2001), 10"/> Additional investigations ''in situ'', meant to complement Verdelis<U+2019> work, were later published by Georges Raepsaet and Walter Werner.<ref>Raepsaet, G. & Tolley, M. (1993)</ref> <ref>Werner, Walter (1997)</ref>

Today, erosion caused by ship movements on the nearby Canal has left considerable portions of the Diolkos in demolition, particularly at its excavated western end.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://greece.org:8080/opencms/opencms/HEC_Projects/DIOLKOS/Gallery.html |title=Pictures showing deterioration of the Diolkos from 1960 to 2006 |accessdate=2008-03-22 |format= |work= }}</ref> Critics who blame the [[Minister for Culture (Greece)|Greek Ministry of Culture]] for continued inactivity have launched a petition for saving and restoring the registered archaeological site.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thepetitionsite.com/petition/870477005 |title=Petionsite.com: Save and Restore Ancient Diolkos |accessdate=2008-03-22 |format= |work= }}</ref>
