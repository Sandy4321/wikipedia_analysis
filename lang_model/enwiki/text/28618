'''David Edward Reese''' (March 28, 1951 &ndash; December 4, 2007), more commonly known as '''Chip Reese''', was an [[United States|American]] professional [[poker]] player and gambler from [[Centerville, Montgomery County, Ohio|Centerville]], [[Ohio]]. He is widely regarded to have been one of the greatest [[cash game]] poker players who ever lived.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/07/sports/07reese.html Newyorktimes.com: Chip Reese, High-Stakes Card Champion, Is Dead at 56]</ref><ref>[http://www.pokerpages.com/players/profiles/55213/david-reese.htm Pokerpages.com: David Reese]</ref><ref>[http://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/article/3125/remembering-chip-reese Remembering Chip Reese]</ref>

==Early life==
Reese suffered from [[rheumatic fever]] during his elementary years at school and had to stay at home for almost a year.  During this time, his mother taught him how to play several board and card games. Reese later described himself as "a product of that year."  By the age of six, he was regularly beating fifth-graders at poker.  In high school he was a [[American football|football]] player and was on the [[debate]] team, winning an Ohio State Championship and going to the National Finals.<ref>[http://www.pokernews.com/news/2006/2/legends-poker-chip-reese.htm Pokernews.com Legends of Poker: David 'Chip' Reese]</ref>  

He attended [[Dartmouth College]] after turning down an offer from [[Harvard University]]. At Dartmouth, he became a member of [[Beta Theta Pi|Beta Theta Pi Fraternity]], played freshman football briefly, participated in debate, and majored in [[economics]]. He also had tremendous success in poker games against students and some of his professors. He taught his fraternity brothers to play a variety of card games, including [[Contract bridge|bridge]] as well as many poker variants.  He played bridge at the Grafton County Grange, one of his regular bridge partners was [[Jim Ryan]].  His fraternity later named their chapter card room, the "David E. Reese Memorial Card Room" in his honor.  He was admitted to [[Stanford Law School]], but decided instead to play poker professionally after winning $60,000 in a tournament in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].  By the time he would have started at Stanford, he had made $100,000.<ref>[[Super System]] 127</ref> His first visit to Las Vegas was so financially rewarding and so much fun, that he literally never left.  He called his day job in Arizona several days later to quit and hired someone to fly to Arizona to clean out his apartment and drive his car to Las Vegas.

==Poker career==
Shortly afterwards, Reese collaborated on the [[seven-card stud]] section for Doyle Brunson's ''[[Super/System]]'', the best-selling [[poker]] book of all time.  In it, Brunson describes Reese as "one of the two finest young ... poker players in the world" and the best seven-card stud player he had ever played.<ref>[[Super System]] 127 - 128</ref>  He won the $1,000 Seven Card Stud Split event at the [[World Series of Poker]] in 1978, and the $5,000 Seven Card Stud tournament there in 1982.  His tournament results may seem modest, but he had decided to concentrate his efforts on cash games instead.
He later became the card room manager at the Dunes [[casino]].  In 1991, he became the youngest living player to be inducted into the [[Poker Hall of Fame]].  By 2006, he was still playing poker and also betting on sports.<ref>[http://www.pokernews.com/news/2006/2/legends-poker-chip-reese.htm]</ref>

At the [[2006 World Series of Poker]], Reese won the inaugural $50,000 [[HORSE (poker)|H.O.R.S.E.]] event, taking home the $1,716,000 first prize when his {{cards|A<U+2663>|Q<U+2663>}} held up against [[Andy Bloch]]'s {{cards|9<U+2663>|8<U+2660>}} in the final hand, on a board of {{cards|J<U+2660>|7<U+2663>|7<U+2660>|4<U+2665>|4<U+2660>}}. This event was notable for having the largest buy-in in WSOP history, as well as the longest heads-up battle with Reese and Bloch playing for 7 hours and 286 hands. By comparison, the final table of the [[2005 World Series of Poker]] Main Event lasted for 232 hands total.

As a tribute, the "David 'Chip' Reese Memorial Trophy" was inaugurated in [[2008 World Series of Poker|2008]] as an additional prize for the winner of the $50,000 H.O.R.S.E. event at the World Series of Poker. The trophy depicts his winning hand of {{cards|A<U+2663>|7<U+2663>|7<U+2660>|4<U+2665>|4<U+2660>}}.<ref>[http://www.pokerlistings.com/wsop-honors-chip-reese-22036 Poker News - WSOP award named for Chip Reese]</ref> Starting in [[2010 World Series of Poker|2010]], the trophy will be awarded to the winner of [[The Poker Player's Championship]], the replacement of the $50,000 H.O.R.S.E. event. It will have the same $50,000 buy-in, but will add no-limit hold 'em, pot-limit Omaha, and limit 2<U+2013>7 triple draw to the five H.O.R.S.E. games, and end with a no-limit hold'em final table.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.wsop.com/news/2009/Dec/2643/2010-WSOP-SCHEDULE-IS-ANNOUNCED.html |title=2010 WSOP Schedule Is Announced |publisher=World Series of Poker |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2009-12-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsop.com/pdfs/2010/10823-structure.pdf |title=2010 World Series of Poker Structure Sheet, Event 2: The Poker Player's Championship |publisher=World Series of Poker |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-02-02}}</ref>

==Death==

Reese died on December 4, 2007, at his Las Vegas home.

Upon learning of Reese's death, [[Doyle Brunson]] stated, "He's certainly the best poker player that ever lived."
