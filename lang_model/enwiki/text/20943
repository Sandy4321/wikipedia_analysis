'''Rhenium''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8>ri<U+02D0>ni<U+0259>m}}) is a [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Re''' and [[atomic number]] 75. A rare silvery-white, heavy, [[polyvalent]] [[transition metal]], rhenium resembles [[manganese]] chemically, and is used in some [[alloy]]s. Rhenium is obtained as a [[by-product]] of [[molybdenum]] refinement, and rhenium-molybdenum alloys are [[superconductivity|superconducting]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=AD0622881 | title = The Properties of Superconducting Mo-Re Alloys | author = Daunt, J.

== Characteristics ==
Rhenium is a silvery white metal, lustrous, and has one of the highest [[melting point]]s of all elements, exceeded by only [[tungsten]] and [[carbon]]. It is also one of the densest, exceeded only by [[platinum]], [[iridium]] and [[osmium]]. Rhenium has the widest range of  [[oxidation state]]s of any known element: -3, -1, 0, +1, +2,  +3, +4, +5, +6 and +7. The oxidation states +7, +6, +4, +2 and -1 are the most common.

Its usual commercial form is a powder, but this element can be consolidated by pressing and resistance-sintering in a vacuum or [[hydrogen]] atmosphere. This procedure yields a compact shape that is in excess of 90 percent of the density of the metal. When [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]] this metal is very ductile and can be bent, coiled, or rolled. Rhenium-molybdenum [[alloy]]s are superconductive at 10 [[Kelvin|K]]; tungsten-rhenium alloys are also superconductive,<ref>{{cite journal | title = Superconductivity of Some Alloys of the Tungsten-rhenium-carbon System | journal = [[Soviet Physics JETP]] | volume = 27 | pages = 13 | date = 1968 | bibcode = 1968JETP...27...13N | author = Neshpor, V.

===Speralloys===

[[Image:F-22F119.JPG|thumb||left| [[Pratt & Whitney F119|The F-22 engine]] uses rhenium containing third generation superalloys]]
The nickel-based [[superalloys]] are improved in their creep strength if rhenium is added to the alloy. The alloys normally contain 3% or 6% of rhenium.<ref>{{cite web | title = Nickel Based Superalloys | first = H. K. D.

In 2006 77% of the rhenium consumption in the United States was due to the use in alloys.<ref name="USGS_2006_yearbook"/>

===Catalysts===

Rhenium is used as rhenium platinum alloy as catalyst for [[catalytic reforming]], which is a chemical process used to convert petroleum refinery [[naphtha]]s, with low [[octane rating]]s, into high-octane liquid products. World wide 30% of catalysts used for this process contain rhenium.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Rhenium-containing catalysts in reactions of organic compounds | year = 1998 | journal Russian Chemical Reviews | volume = 67 | pages = 157&ndash;177 | doi = 10.1070/RC1998v067n02ABEH000390 | first = Margarita A. | last =  Ryashentseva}}</ref> 

The [[olefin metathesis]] is the other reaction for which rhenium is used as catalyst. Normaly Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> on [[alumina]] is used for this process.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Catalysis Today  | volume = 51| issue = 2 | year = 1999 | pages = 289-299Olefin metathesis over supported rhenium oxide catalysts | first = Johannes C. | last = Mol}}</ref>

* Related by [[periodic trends]], rhenium has a similar chemistry with [[technetium]]; work done to label rhenium onto target compounds can often be translated to technetium. This is useful for radiopharmacy, where it is difficult to work with technetium - especially the 99m isotope used in medicine - due to its expense and short half-life.

== History ==
Rhenium ([[Latin]] ''Rhenus'' meaning "[[Rhine]]")<ref>{{cite book | language = Geraman | title = Forschen Suche und Sucht | first = Hans Georg | last = Tilgner | publisher = Books on Demand| year = 2000 | isbn = 9783898112727 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=UWBWnMOGtMQC}}</ref> was the next-to-last naturally occurring element to be discovered and the last element to be discovered having a stable isotope.  The existence of a yet undiscovered element at this position in the [[periodic table]] had been predicted by [[Henry Moseley]] in 1914. It is generally considered to have been discovered by [[Walter Noddack]], [[Ida Tacke]], and [[Otto Berg (scientist)|Otto Berg]] in [[Germany]]. In 1925 they reported that they detected the element in platinum ore and in the mineral [[columbite]]. They also found rhenium in [[gadolinite]] and [[molybdenite]].<ref name='Ekamangane'> {{cite journal|author=Noddack, W.; Tacke, I.; Berg, O|title=Die Ekamangane

The process was so complicated and the cost so high that production was discontinued until early 1950 when tungsten-rhenium and molybdenum-rhenium alloys were prepared. These alloys found important applications in industry that resulted in a great demand for the rhenium produced from the molybdenite fraction of porphyry [[copper]] ores.

In 1908, [[Japan]]ese chemist [[Masataka Ogawa]] announced that he discovered the 43rd element, and named it ''nipponium'' (Np) after [[Japan]] (which is ''Nippon'' in Japanese). However, later analysis indicated the presence of rhenium (element 75), not [[Technetium|element 43]]. The symbol Np was later used for the element [[neptunium]].

== Occurrence ==
[[Image:Molybdenit 1.jpg | thumb | left | Molybdenit ]]
Rhenium is probably not found free in nature (its possible natural occurrence is uncertain), but occurs in amounts up to 0.2% in the mineral molybdenite, the major commercial source.  It was only recently that the first rhenium [[mineral]] was found and described (in 1994), a rhenium [[sulfide mineral]] (ReS<sub>2</sub>) condensing from a [[fumarole]] on [[Russia]]'s [[Kudriavy]] volcano, in the [[Kurile Islands]].<ref>{{cite journal

Rhenium is widely spread through the [[Earth]]'s [[crust (geology)|crust]] at approximately 1 [[Parts-per notation|ppb]].

==Production==
[[Image:Ammonium perrhenate.jpg|thumb|right|Ammonium perrhenate]]
Commercial rhenium is extracted from molybdenum roaster-flue gas obtained from copper-sulfide ores. Some molybdenum ores contain 0.002%  to 0.2% rhenium. [[Rhenium(VII) oxide]] and [[perrhenic acid]] readily dissolve in water; they are leached from flue dusts and gasses and extracted by precipitating with [[potassium chloride|potassium]] or [[ammonium chloride]] as the [[perrhenate]] salts, and purified by [[recrystallization]].<ref name = patnaik>{{cite book | title = Handbook of Inorganic Chemicals | author = Pradyot Patnaik | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | isbn = 0070494398 | pages = 790 | year = 2003 | oclc = 47726843}}</ref> Total world production is between 40 and 50 tons/year; the main producers are in Chile, USA and Kazakhstan.<ref name="USGS_2008_summary">{{cite web | title = Rhenium | work = Mineral Commodity Summaries  | publisher = U.S. Geological Survey | date = January 2008 | url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/rhenium/mcs-2008-rheni.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-02-17}}</ref> Recycling of used Pt-Re catalyst and special alloys allow the recovery of another 10 tons/year.

Rhenium is most available commercially as the [[sodium perrhenate|sodium]] and [[ammonium perrhenate]]s. It is also readily available as [[dirhenium decacarbonyl]]; these three compounds are common entry points to rhenium chemistry.

Various perrhenate salts may be easily converted to [[tetrathioperrhenate]] by the action of [[ammonium hydrosulfide]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Goodman, J. T.; Rauchfuss, T.
