'''Concho Indian Boarding School''' (also known as the '''Cheyenne-Arapaho Boarding School at Concho''' and home to the '''Concho Demonstration School''') was a boarding school for members of the [[Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes]] and later opened to other Native American students. It was located in central Oklahoma from 1909 to 1983 approximately 1 mile south of [[Concho, Oklahoma]] and 4 miles north of [[El Reno, Oklahoma]].<ref name="Dias (1933)">{{cite journal|last1=Dias|first1=William T.|title=Historical Sketch of Cheyenne-Arapaho School and Agency|journal=Oklahoma Indian School Magazine|date=1933|volume=Volume 2|issue=Number 2|pages=5-6|url=http://digitalprairie.ok.gov/cdm/ref/collection/culture/id/2311|accessdate=3 February 2015|publisher=Chilocco Indian Boarding School|location=Chilocco, Oklahoma}}</ref> The name of the town and school is the Spanish word for "shell" and was named for the Indian agent, Charles E.

Concho was developed to provide a means of integrating and assimilating American Indian children into mainstream society.

Initially, the school offered education to the 6th grade and students would have to transfer to [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School|Carlisle]], [[Chilocco Indian Agricultural School|Chilocco]] or [[Haskell Institute]] for secondary education. By around the 1920s, the school curriculum mirrored public education being offered throughout the country and included sports, music, art, and a full course of educational subjects.<ref name="Fowler (2010)" /> By the time the school closed in the early 1980s, it offered instruction for grades one - eight and was predominantly attended by orphans and students who had difficult home environments.<ref name="Senate (1982)">{{cite web|title=Closing of Off-Reservation Boarding Schools.

==History==
The first school was opened at the [[Darlington Agency]] on the Cheyenne-Arapaho Reservation in 1871 by the Hicksite (Liberal) Friends and Orthodox [[Quakers]] and was called the Cheyenne-Arapaho Boarding School.<ref name="McKellips (1992)">{{cite journal|last1=McKellips|first1=Karen K|title=Educational Practices in Two Nineteenth Century American Indian Mission Schools|journal=Journal of American Indian Education|date=October 1992|volume=Volume 32 Number 1|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> In 1872, the facility was built with federal funds,<ref name=Everett>{{cite web|last1=Everett|first1=Dianna|title=SEGER, JOHN HOMER (1846-1928)|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/S/SE005.html|website=Oklahoma State University|publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> but run by the [[Quakers]]. Few Cheyenne children attended the school and as a means to entice them, a partition was erected to divide the classroom into separate areas for the Arapaho and Cheyenne students.<ref name="McKellips (1992)" /> In 1879 the facility was renamed the Arapaho Manual Labor and Boarding School and a new facility was built for the Cheyenne students located at Caddo Springs, which was called the Cheyenne Manual Labor and Boarding School.<ref name=Everett /> Within 5 years, it was reported that the children at the agency schools were responsible for raising 211 cattle and hogs and cultivating 130 acres of land.<ref name="Steere (2009)">{{cite book|last1=Steere|first1=Bobby F.|title=The trace of the Southern Arapaho|date=2009|publisher=iUniverse, Inc.|location=Bloomington, Ind.|isbn=978-1-4401-0402-2|page=36|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=GxVQaUYBlKcC&lpg|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>

In 1881, a new school, called the Darlington Mission School was built and run by the General Conference [[Mennonite]]s but a fire which occurred on 19 February, 1882 destroyed the building, taking the life of the missionary's infant son and three Indian children. Federal funds and donations from the Mennonite Mission Board were secured to rebuild the mission school by December, 1882.<ref name="Thiesen (2006)">{{cite journal|last1=Thiesen|first1=Barbara A|title=Every Beginning Is Hard: Darlington Mennonite Mission, 1880-1902|journal=Mennonite Life|date=June 2006|volume=vol. 61 no. 2|url=http://ml.bethelks.edu/issue/vol-61-no-2/article/every-beginning-is-hard-darlington-mennonite-missi/ |accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> The Mennonites had the same problems as the [[Quakers]] had had in trying educating the two tribes together, and opened a fourth school in 1882<ref name="McKellips (1992)" /> called Cantonment.

After 1891 federal policy shifted and began to require more standardization, attendance quotas and less use of federal funds for church "contracted" institutions.<ref name="Thiesen (2006)" /> By the mid 1890s only about half of the school-age children on the Cheyenne-Arapaho Reservation were attending school. An experiment with enrolling Indian children in the public school system and offsetting the costs to the schools was attempted in 1896-1897, but was discontinued.<ref name="Berthrong (1992)">{{cite book|last1=Berthrong|first1=Donald J.|title=The Cheyenne and Arapaho ordeal : reservation and agency life in the Indian territory, 1875-1907|date=1992|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|isbn=0-8061-2416-4|edition=New ed.|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=3AZR7KdHhtIC&lpg|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>  Declining attendance at Darlington forced its permanent closure in June, 1898<ref name="Thiesen (2006)" /> and Cantonment closed in 1901.<ref name="Dalke (1955)">{{cite journal|last1=Dalke|first1=Herbert M|title=Seventy-five Years of Missions in Oklahoma|journal=Mennonite Life|date=July 1955|volume=Vol. X|issue=No. 3|page=102|url=http://ml.bethelks.edu/store/ml/files/1955jul.pdf|accessdate=3 February 2015|location=North Newton, Kansas}}</ref> In 1908 both the Arapaho Manual Labor and Boarding School and the Cheyenne Manual Labor and Boarding School were closed and the facilities sold by the government.<ref name="P.

The era of the federal [[Indian termination policy|Indian Termination Policy]] from the 1940s through the 1960s saw threats to close tribal schools and Concho was not immune.

Earl C Intolubbe, a [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma|Choctaw]] who was working as an Education Guidance Specialist for the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] set up a model school at Concho. The idea was to keep classrooms small so that children received individual attention. Students who had dropped out of other schools were placed in the special program. Some returned within weeks or months to their prior boarding schools or public schools, and some stayed for years. After 6 years of operation, with a 60% success rate, Intolubbe retired in 1968 when it was suggested that the Demonstration School be combined with the Boarding School.<ref name=Intolubbe>{{cite web|last1=Intolubbe|first1=Velma|title=Earl C Intolubbe (Intolabbee)|url=http://www.choctawnation.com/history/people/original-enrollees/intolubbe-earl-c/|website=Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma|publisher=Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref>
