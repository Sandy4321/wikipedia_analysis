== History ==
===Antiquity===
Maghar was known as "Zar" during the [[Roman Empire|Roman period]]. Many olive groves and wine presses testify to a long history of agriculture in the area, and  numerous hillside caves show signs of ancient habitation. The village's name comes from the Arabic word for "the caves".<ref name=Palmer131/> 
===Ottoman era===
In 1596 the village appeared in the [[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman]] tax registers as ''Magar Hazur'',  part of the ''[[nahiya]]'' of [[Tabariyya]] in the [[Sanjak|Liwa]] of [[Safad]]. It had an entirely [[Muslim]] population consisting of 169 households and 17 bachelors. Taxes were paid on [[wheat]], [[barley]], olive trees,  goats and/or beehives, and a press for olives or grapes.<ref>H<U+00FC>tteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 187.</ref>

The 19th century  French explorer [[Victor Gu<U+00E9>rin]] found the village, which he called ''el-Mehar'', to be a large one with 1200 inhabitants. It was divided into three quarters, with Muslim, Christian and Druse inhabitants.<ref>Gu<U+00E9>rin, 1880,  p. [http://www.archive.org/stream/descriptiongogr01unkngoog#page/n470/mode/1up 457]-458</ref>  In 1881,  the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]'s ''Survey of Western Palestine'' described El Mughar as a "large stone-built village, containing about 1,100 Moslems, Druses, and Christians, situated on the slope of the hill, with extensive olive-groves to the south and west; a large spring and birkeh
gives a good supply of water."<ref name=SWP364>Conder and Kitchener, 1881,  p. [http://www.archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/364/mode/1up 364]</ref>
