The '''Wilmington Rail Viaduct''' is a series of fills and bridges, about {{convert|4|mi|km}} long, that carry the [[Northeast Corridor]] through the city of [[Wilmington, Delaware]] above street level. Constructed between 1902 and 1908, the structure consists principally of fills supported by heavy stone [[retaining wall]]s, punctuated with [[plate girder]] bridges over streets, and augmented by a few sections of brick arch [[viaduct]]. Its construction is typical of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s architectural practices at the time, and the viaduct has been added to both the [[Historic American Engineering Record]] and the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Built by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) as part of a series of [[grade crossing]] eliminations along the Northeast Corridor, the elevation of the rail line necessitated several other changes to rail infrastructure in Wilmington, including the construction of the [[Wilmington Shops]] at the east end of the viaduct, and the construction of the [[Wilmington Station]] and adjacent Pennsylvania Railroad Office Building along the elevated [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]].

==Physical description==
The viaduct extends from Vandever Ave, on its east end (a location on the railroad known as LANDLITH interlocking), across the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]] and then roughly parallel to the [[Christina River]] through Wilmington Station. The west end of the viaduct is adjacent to the Alban Park neighborhood of Wilmington, an area also known as West Yard.<ref name="nrhp">[http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/99001276.pdf National Register of Historic Places listing]</ref>

The bulk of the viaduct, from Vandever Avenue to Lower Linden Street, consists of earthen fill (derived from the construction excavation for the viaduct) held between heavy [[ashlar]] [[sandstone]] retaining walls resting on concrete foundations. Some of the northern sections of the viaduct have fill enclosed in timber cribbing on one side of the right-of-way, but generally the fill is contained with retaining walls on both sides. The ashlar also forms the abutments for the overpasses carrying the railroad tracks across city streets, which are steel plate through girder or deck girder bridges. The fill carries three tracks for much of its length; sidings, some now abandoned, descend to street level by ramps at various points. It was topped with {{convert|4|ft|m}} of [[Track ballast|ballast]] before tracks were laid. <!-- detailed description of bridges --><ref name="nrhp" />

The west end of the viaduct, below Lower Linden Street, was constructed as an arched viaduct when the underlying soil was found to be too soft to support the fill carrying the remainder of the line. Originally designed in stone, shortages of sandstone led to the construction of the {{convert|41|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} arches in brick, instead. Twelve arches carry the line from Lower Linden Street to the (stone) Beech Street underpass, and twenty arches continue southwest from Beech Street to the former [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore and Ohio]] and [[Wilmington and Northern Railroad|Wilmington and Northern]] underpass. The remainder of the structure to its West Yard end is again of retaining wall and fill construction. <!-- detailed description of viaduct --><ref name="rage">{{cite journal | title=Pennsylvania Improvements at Wilmington | journal=Railway Age | volume=38 | year=1905 | pages=532<U+2013>535 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RINPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA532}}</ref>

The bridge over the Brandywine Creek near the east end of the viaduct had to be replaced to accommodate the newly elevated track level. At the time, this part of the Brandywine was considered navigable water, though rarely used, and the railroad had to construct a [[moveable bridge]] to accommodate navigation. The railroad chose to use a [[swing bridge]], and began construction of the center pivot pier in the winter of 1903. The first [[caisson (engineering)|caisson]] sunk there was damaged by ice and swept away in a flood. A new caisson was built resumed after the winter passed and a stone-faced concrete pier, {{convert|35|ft|m}} in diameter, successfully constructed. A second pier was built in the stream to the southwest, leaving two {{convert|59|ft|m|adj=on}} channels between the pivot pier and the bank and the pivot and second piers. Icebreakers were built on either side of the pivot pier. (The tidal nature of the Brandywine required them to be bidirectional.)<ref name="rage" />

The superstructure of the bridge was manufactured by the [[Phoenix Bridge Company]]. It consisted of a {{convert|78|ft|m|adj=on}} plate girder from the southwest bank to a fixed pier, and a {{convert|158|ft|m|adj=on}} fishbelly girder from that pier to the northeast bank, turning on the pivot pier. It carries three tracks. Two buildings were erected on the bridge, one for a watchman and the signal levers that protected and operated the bridge, and one to house the gasoline engine that turned it.<ref name="rage" /> The [[interlocking]] levers on the swing bridge were placed in service on March 4, 1906; this was the first electro-mechanical interlocking using small levers (rather than the rod-linked armstrong levers typical at the time) on the Pennsylvania Railroad system.<ref name="prr1906">{{cite web | title=PRR Chronology 1906 | author=Chris Baer | publisher=Pennsylvania Railroad Technical & Historical Society | url=http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR1906%20Mar%2005.pdf}}</ref>

The structure has undergone relatively little modification since its construction. A 1920s [[Pennsylvania Railroad#Pennsylvania Railroad electrification|electrification program]] to Wilmington added support structures to string [[Overhead lines|catenary wires]] along the length of the viaduct. During the early 20th Century, the swing bridge over the Brandywine was fixed in place and the engine and control buildings removed. In 1955, the construction of the [[Walnut Street Bridge (Wilmington, Delaware)|Walnut Street Bridge]] required an undergrade bridge to be built to carry a new, wider alignment of Walnut Street slightly to the east of its original course. The new bridge is of plate girder construction over concrete abutments and piers. In 1983, Amtrak replaced the superstructure of the Poplar Street bridge and refurbished the piers and abutments.

==History==
The rail line through Wilmington, originally constructed by the [[Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad]] in 1837,<ref>ICC Valuation Reports, Volume 22.</ref> came under the control of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] (PRR) when it bought a controlling interest in the PW&B in 1881. As the PRR digested its [[Gilded Age]] acquisitions, freight traffic on its lines boomed, increasing by 64% between 1897 and 1902 in the recovery following the [[Panic of 1893]]. Longer, heavier, and more frequent trains pushed the railroad's existing infrastructure to its limits; however, they also brought an enormous increase in earnings. During the beginning of the 20th Century, the PRR invested a portion of these profits in improving its rights-of-way and expanding capacity throughout its system.<ref name="triumph">{{cite book | title=Triumph VI: Philadelphia, Columbia, Harrisburg to Baltimore and Washington, DC, 1827-2003 | authors=Charles S. Roberts, David W. Messer | publisher=Barnard, Roberts & Co. | location=Baltimore | year=2003 | pages=77<U+2013>78}}</ref>

An important component of these improvements was grade crossing elimination. In many of the cities served by PRR lines, the railroad tracks ran at ground level, crossing the streets at grade. As train speeds increased and traffic swelled, preventing grade crossing accidents became increasingly difficult. In Wilmington, the PRR had already built the [[Shellpot Branch]] in 1888 to divert through freight traffic through the sparsely developed marshes to the south of the city.<ref name="triumph" /> However, many industries along the Christina waterfront still required local freight service, and congestion in the city streets remained a serious problem.

In February 1901, the PRR's Annual Report announced the railroad's intention to make extensive improvements to its line between Philadelphia and [[Washington, DC]]. In the Wilmington, the planned improvements included the double-tracking of the Shellpot Branch, the elevation of the main line through the city, and the construction of a new station along the elevated main line. The railroad's shops were also to be moved from 3rd and Church Streets to Todd's Cut, to the east of the city near Edgemoor. This would allow ample room to expand the shops, and would make room for a realignment of the main line to reduce curvature and increase train speeds.<ref name="nrhp" />

The original plan for the viaduct called for a double-track structure, enclosed between two stone walls {{convert|12|and|14|ft|m}} high, which would largely follow the previous alignment of the main line. The choice of stonework reflected prevailing practice on the PRR and its rival, the [[New York Central]]. The choice of stone, in preference to steel bridges, reflected engineering conservatism on the part of the railroads, and also associated the railroad structures with a sense of permanency and a monumental aesthetic. The PRR's Chief Engineer, William H. Brown, was particularly known for his advocacy of stone construction,<ref>{{cite journal | journal=Engineering and Contracting | volume=34 | issue=1 | title=Contract News Section | page=43 | date=July 6, 1910 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=A6fmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA24-IA1}}</ref> and it was under his direction that the railroad's engineering department drew up the plans for the viaduct.

City streets were to be crossed by iron bridges, minimizing roadwork. The railroad originally planned to build iron bridgework to connect old and new segments of the main line during construction to minimize service disruptions. However, it was not required, because service was able to continue on the old main line without interruption. Plans also had to be altered in the West Yard area, where marshy ground dictated the construction of an arched viaduct rather than a fill. Construction commenced in the spring of 1902, starting in the area around Wilmington station and working outwards. Simultaneously, construction began from LANDLITH toward the Brandywine. The original completion date of mid-1905 was not met,<ref name="nrhp" /> in part due to a general retrenchment which temporarily stopped the work, apart from the Brandywine Creek bridge, on March 1, 1904. The southbound tracks were placed in service from the new Wilmington Shops south across the Brandywine to 5th Street on August 25, and on September 24, construction work resumed to add a third track from the Brandywine to the shops.<ref name="prr1904">{{cite web | title=PRR Chronology 1904 | author=Chris Baer | publisher=Pennsylvania Railroad Technical & Historical Society | url=http://www.prrths.com/hagley/prr1904%20mar%2005.pdf}}</ref> The new swing bridge over the Brandywine was opened on March 1, 1906,<ref name="prr1906" /> and the southbound tracks were opened over the length of the viaduct on January 28, 1907. The northbound tracks were opened on March 16;<ref name="prr1904">{{cite web | title=PRR Chronology 1907 | author=Chris Baer | publisher=Pennsylvania Railroad Technical & Historical Society | url=http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR1907%20Mar%2005.pdf}}</ref> however, the side of the new Wilmington station serving those tracks did not go into service until July 7, 1908.<ref name="prr1908">{{cite web | title=PRR Chronology 1904 | author=Chris Baer | publisher=Pennsylvania Railroad Technical & Historical Society | url=http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR1908%20Mar%2005.pdf}}</ref>

As early as 1918, the PRR had begun electrifying some of its lines radiating from [[Philadelphia]] to replace steam trains with double-ended [[multiple unit]] cars to ease congestion at its terminal. Extension of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad#Pennsylvania Railroad electrification|electrification program]] to Wilmington was announced on March 25, 1926,<ref name="prr1926">{{cite web | title=PRR Chronology 1904 | author=Chris Baer | publisher=Pennsylvania Railroad Technical & Historical Society | url=http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR1926%20Jul%2004.wd.pdf}}</ref> and electrified local service opened on September 30, 1928.<ref name="prr1928">{{cite web | title=PRR Chronology 1904 | author=Chris Baer | publisher=Pennsylvania Railroad Technical & Historical Society | url=http://www.prrths.com/hagley/prr1928%20jul%2004.wd.pdf}}</ref>

The PRR continued to operate service over the viaduct until its 1968 merger with the [[New York Central Railroad]] to form the [[Penn Central Transportation Company]]. After the bankruptcy of Penn Central in 1976, the viaduct, with the rest of the [[Northeast Corridor]], was transferred to [[Amtrak]], which currently maintains and operates it.

Construction of the viaduct had a significant effect on the development of Wilmington. In addition to emphasizing the stability and importance of the PRR, the elevated fill both visually and spatially separated the Christina River waterfront from the rest of the city north of Front Street. It served to both maintain and screen the heavy industries that grew up along the waterfront during the 20th Century.<ref name="nrhp" /> With the passing of these industries and the redevelopment of the Wilmington waterfront, the viaduct now forms one boundary of the city's riverfront district.<ref>{{cite web | title=Riverfront Wilmington map | publisher=Riverfront Development Corporation | url=http://www.riverfrontwilm.com/uploads/pdfs/riverfrontmap.pdf}}</ref>
