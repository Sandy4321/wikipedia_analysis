'''Operation Ten-Go''' (<U+5929><U+53F7><U+4F5C><U+6226> ''ten-g<U+014D> sakusen''), sometimes referred to as ''Ten'ichigo'' (meaning ''Heaven number-one''), was the last major [[Japan]]ese [[Navy|naval]] [[military operation|operation]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific campaign]] of [[World War II]].  The Japanese [[battleship]] ''[[Japanese battleship Yamato|Yamato]]'', the largest battleship in the [[world]], along with nine other Japanese [[warship]]s, [[sortie]]d from Japan on an intentional [[suicide attack|one-way mission]] to attack the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] that were [[Battle of Okinawa|invading Okinawa]].  The Japanese force was attacked, stopped, and almost completely destroyed before reaching [[Okinawa]] by [[United States of America|U.S.]] [[aircraft carrier|carrier]] aircraft which sank ''Yamato'' and five other Japanese warships.

The battle emphasized the aerial control that the U.S. had attained in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific theater]] as well as the [[vulnerability]] of [[surface ship]]s to aerial attack.  The battle also apparently exhibited Japan's willingness to [[sacrifice]] large numbers of its people in desperate and [[suicide|suicidal]] [[military tactics|tactics]] in an attempt to slow or stop the Allied advance on the Japanese [[homeland]].

==Background==
By spring 1945, following the [[Solomon Islands campaign]] and Battles of [[Battle of the Philippine Sea|the Philippine Sea]] and [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Leyte Gulf]], the once imposing [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s Combined Fleet was reduced to just a handful of operational [[warship]]s and a few remaining [[aircraft]] and [[Aircrew member|aircrew]].  Most of the remaining Japanese warships in the Combined Fleet were [[military base|stationed]] at [[port]]s in Japan, with most of the large ships at [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]]. <ref>Hara, ''Japanese Destroyer Captain'', 274.</ref>

With the [[invasion]]s of [[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]] and [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]], Allied (primarily U.S.) [[military unit|forces]] began their [[military campaign|campaign]] against the Japanese homeland itself.  As the next step before a [[Operation Downfall|planned invasion]] of the Japanese [[Mainland Japan|mainland]], Allied forces [[Battle of Okinawa|invaded Okinawa]] on [[April 1]], [[1945]].  In March, in briefing [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Hirohito]] on Japan's response to the expected Okinawan invasion, Japanese military leaders explained that the [[Japanese Imperial Army|Army]] was planning extensive air attacks, including the use of [[kamikaze]].  The emperor then reportedly asked, "But what about the Navy?  What are they doing to assist in defending Okinawa?"  Now feeling [[peer pressure|pressured]] by the emperor to mount some kind of attack also, Japan's Navy commanders conceived a kamikaze-type mission for their remaining operational large ships, which included the [[battleship]] [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']].<ref>Feifer, ''The Battle of Okinawa'', 7.</ref>  

The resulting plan, drafted under the direction of the Commander in Chief of the Combined Fleet, [[Admiral]] [[Toyoda Soemu]],<ref>Minear, ''Requiem'', xiii.</ref> called for ''Yamato'' and her escorts to attack the U.S. fleet supporting the U.S. troops landing on the west of the island.  ''Yamato'' and her escorts were to fight their way to Okinawa and then to beach themselves between [[Higashi, Okinawa|Higashi]] and [[Yomitan, Okinawa|Yomitan]] and fight as [[shore battery|shore batteries]] until they were destroyed.  Once destroyed, the ship's surviving crewmembers were supposed to abandon the ships and fight U.S. forces on land.  Very little, if any, air cover could be provided for the ships, which would render them almost helpless to concentrated U.S. air attacks.<ref>Feifer, ''The Battle of Okinawa'', 7.</ref>  In preparation for executing the plan, the assigned ships left Kure for [[Tokuyama]], off [[Mitajiri]], Japan, on [[March 29]].<ref>Yoshida, ''Requiem'', 6<U+2013>7.</ref>  However, in spite of obeying orders to prepare for the mission, Admiral [[Ito Seiichi]], commander of the Ten-Go force, still refused to actually order his ships to carry it out, believing the plan to be futile and wasteful.<ref>Yoshida, ''Requiem'', 62.</ref>

Vice Admiral [[Ryunosuke Kusaka|Kusaka Ryunosuke]] flew from Tokyo on [[April 5]] to Tokuyama in a final attempt to convince the assembled commanders of the Combined Fleet, including Admiral Ito, to accept the plan.  Upon first hearing of the proposed operation (it had been kept secret from most of them until now), the Combined Fleet commanders and captains unanimously joined Admiral Ito in rejecting it for the same reasons that he had expressed.  Admiral Kusaka then explained that the Navy's attack would help decoy U.S. aircraft away from the Army's planned air attacks on the U.S. fleet at Okinawa.  He also explained that Japan's national leadership, including the emperor, were expecting the Navy to make their best effort to support the defense of Okinawa.  Upon hearing this, the Combined Fleet commanders relented and accepted the proposed plan.  The ship's crews were briefed on the nature of the mission and given the opportunity to stay behind if desired&mdash;none did.  However, new, sick, and infirm crewmembers were ordered off the ships.<ref>Hara, ''Japanese Destroyer Captain'', 277.</ref>  The ships' crews now engaged in some last-minute intense drills to prepare for the mission, mostly practicing [[damage control|damage-control]] procedures.<ref>Yoshida, ''Requiem'', 15.</ref>  At midnight the ships were fueled.  Reportedly, in secret defiance of orders to provide the ships with only just enough fuel to reach Okinawa, the Tokuyama personnel actually gave ''Yamato'' and the other ships almost all of the remaining fuel in the port, although this probably still was not enough to allow the force to return to Japan from Okinawa.<ref>Spurr, ''A Glorious Way to Die'', 162<U+2013>165.</ref>

==Battle==
[[image:ten-goMap1.png|250 px|thumb|left|Routes of the [[Japan]]ese force (solid black) and [[U.S.]] carrier aircraft (dotted red) to the battle area (X).]]On [[April 6]] at [[24-hour clock|16:00 hours]], ''Yamato'', with Admiral Ito on board, the [[light cruiser]] [[Japanese cruiser Yahagi|''Yahagi'']], and eight [[destroyer]]s departed Tokuyama to begin the mission.<ref>Yoshida, ''Requiem'', 30.</ref>  Two U.S. [[submarine]]s, [[USS Threadfin (SS-410)|''Threadfin'']] and [[USS Hackleback (SS-295)|''Hackleback'']], sighted the Japanese force as it proceeded south through [[Bungo Suido]] but were unable to attack.  However, they notified the U.S. fleet of the Japanese [[sortie]].<ref>Skulski, ''The Battleship Yamato'', 12.</ref>

At dawn on [[April 7]], the Japanese force passed the [[Osumi Peninsula]] into the open [[ocean]] heading [[south]] from [[Kyushu]] towards Okinawa.  They shifted into a defensive [[formation (military)|formation]], with ''Yahagi'' leading ''Yamato'' and the eight destroyers deployed in a ring around the two larger ships, with each ship 1,500&nbsp;[[metre|meters]] from each other and proceeding at 20&nbsp;[[knot]]s.<ref>Yoshida, ''Requiem'', 47<U+2013>49.</ref>  One of the Japanese destroyers, [[Japanese destroyer Asashimo|''Asashimo'']], developed [[engine]] trouble and turned back.  U.S. [[reconnaissance]] aircraft now began to [[surveillance|shadow]] the main force of ships.  At 10:00 hours, the Japanese force turned [[west]] to make it look like they were [[withdrawal (military)|withdrawing]], but at 11:30, they turned back towards Okinawa.<ref>Hara, ''Japanese Destroyer Captain'', 277.</ref>   

[[image:Yamato2.jpg|200 px|thumb|right|U.S. aircraft, such as this [[dive-bomber]], begin their attacks on [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']] (center left).  A Japanese [[destroyer]] is in the center right of the picture. <ref>Nova:  ''Sinking the Supership''.</ref>]]Around 10:00 this same day (April 7), the U.S. Navy began launching almost 400 aircraft in several waves from eleven carriers of Vice Admiral [[Marc A. Mitscher]]'s Task Force 58 ([[USS Hornet (CV-12)|''Hornet'']], [[USS Bennington (CV-20)|''Bennington'']], [[USS Belleau Wood (CVL-24)|''Belleau Wood'']], [[USS San Jacinto (CVL-30)|''San Jacinto'']], [[USS Essex (CV-9)|''Essex'']], [[USS Bunker Hill (CV-17)|''Bunker Hill'']], [[USS Hancock (CV-19)|''Hancock'']], [[USS Bataan (CVL-29)|''Bataan'']], [[USS Intrepid (CV-11)|''Intrepid'']], [[USS Yorktown (CV-10)|''Yorktown'']], and [[USS Langley (CVL-27)|''Langley'']]) that were located just east of Okinawa.  The aircraft consisted of [[F6F Hellcat]] [[fighter]]s, [[SB2C Helldiver]] [[dive-bomber]]s, and [[TBF Avenger]] [[torpedo bomber]]s.  A force of six battleships ([[USS Massachusetts (BB-59)|''Massachusetts'']], [[USS Indiana (BB-58)|''Indiana'']], [[USS New Jersey (BB-62)|''New Jersey'']], [[USS South Dakota (BB-57)|''South Dakota'']], [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|''Wisconsin'']], and [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|''Missouri'']]) supported by cruisers (including [[USS Alaska (CB-1)|''Alaska'']] and [[USS Guam (CB-2)|''Guam'']]) and destroyers was also assembled to intercept the Japanese fleet if the [[airstrike|air-strikes]] did not succeed. <ref>navweaps.com</ref>

Due to the Japanese force not having any air cover, the U.S. aircraft were able to set up for their attacks without fear of opposition from Japanese aircraft.  U.S. attack aircraft arriving over the ''Yamato'' group, after their two-hour flight from Okinawa, were thus able to circle the Japanese ship formation just out of [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] range, methodically setting up their attacks on the warships below.<ref>Hara, ''Japanese Destroyer Captain'', 277.</ref>

The first wave of U.S. carrier aircraft engaged the Japanese ships starting at 12:30 hours.  The Japanese ships increased speed to 25&nbsp;knots, began evasive maneuvers, and opened fire with their anti-aircraft guns.  ''Yamato'' herself carried almost 150 anti-aircraft guns.<ref>Yoshida, ''Requiem'', 62<U+2013>64.</ref>  The U.S. torpedo airplanes mainly attacked from the [[port (nautical)|port]] side so that, if the torpedoes mainly hit from that side, it would increase the likelihood of the target ship to [[capsize]].<ref>Yoshida, ''Requiem'', 74.</ref>

[[image:Yahagi.jpg|250 px|thumb|left|[[Light cruiser]] [[Japanese cruiser Yahagi|''Yahagi'']] under intense bomb and torpedo attack. <ref>CombinedFleet.com</ref>]]At 12:46, a [[torpedo]] hit [[Japanese cruiser Yahagi|''Yahagi'']] directly in her engine room, killing the entire engineering room crew and bringing her to a complete stop.  Dead in the water, ''Yahagi'' was hit by at least six more torpedoes and 12 [[bomb]]s by succeeding waves of air attacks.  Japanese destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Isokaze|''Isokaze'']] attempted to come to ''Yahagi'''s aid but was herself attacked, heavily damaged, and sank sometime later.  ''Yahagi'' capsized and sank at 14:05 hours.  Her survivors, left floating in the water, could see the ''Yamato'' in the distance, still apparently steaming south and fighting attacking U.S. aircraft.  However, in reality, ''Yamato'' herself was only minutes away from sinking.<ref>Hara, ''Japanese Destroyer Captain'', 298.</ref>

During the first attack wave, in spite of intensive evasive maneuvers that caused most of the bombs and torpedoes aimed at her to miss, ''Yamato'' was hit by two [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] bombs and one torpedo.<ref>Yoshida, ''Requiem'', 66.</ref>  Her speed was not affected, but one of the bombs started a fire [[aft]] of the [[superstructure]] that was never extinguished.  Also, during the first attack wave, Japanese destroyers [[Japanese destroyer Hamakaze|''Hamakaze'']] and [[Japanese destroyer Suzutsuki|''Suzutsuki'']] were heavily damaged and taken out of the battle.  ''Hamakaze'' sank sometime later.<ref>CombinedFleet.com</ref>

[[image:Yamato1.jpg|200 px|thumb|right|[[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']] (upper right) dodging air attack during the battle. <ref>Nova:  ''Sinking the Supership''.</ref>]]Between 13:20 and 14:15, the second and third waves of U.S. aircraft attacked, heavily concentrating on the ''Yamato''.  During this time, ''Yamato'' was hit by at least eight torpedoes and up to 15 bombs.  The bombs did extensive damage to the topside of the ship, including knocking out power to the [[gun director]]s and forcing the anti-aircraft guns to be individually and manually aimed and fired, greatly reducing their effectiveness.<ref>Yoshida, ''Requiem'', 78.</ref>  The torpedo hits, almost all on the port side, caused the ''Yamato'' to list enough that capsizing was now an imminent danger.<ref>Yoshida, ''Requiem'', 80.</ref>  However, the water damage-control station had been destroyed by a bomb hit, making it impossible to counter-flood the specially designed spaces within the ship's [[hull]] to counteract hull damage.  Therefore, at 13:33, in a desperate attempt to keep the ship from capsizing, ''Yamato'''s damage control team counter-flooded both [[starboard]] engine and [[boiler]] rooms, mitigating the danger, but also [[drown]]ing the several hundred crewmen manning those stations, who were given no notice that their compartments were about to fill with water.<ref>Yoshida, ''Requiem'', 82.</ref>  The lives of those crewmen bought ''Yamato'' about 30 more minutes of life. <ref>Feifer, ''The Battle of Okinawa'', 17<U+2013>25.</ref>  The loss of the starboard engines, plus the weight of the water, caused ''Yamato'' to slow to about 10&nbsp;knots.<ref>Yoshida, ''Requiem'', 83.</ref>

With ''Yamato'' now proceeding more slowly and therefore easier to target, U.S. torpedo aircraft concentrated on hitting her rudder and stern with torpedoes in order to affect her steering ability, which they succeeded in doing.<ref>Yoshida, ''Requiem'', 95<U+2013>96.</ref>  At 14:02, after being informed that the ship could no longer steer and was unavoidably sinking, Admiral Ito ordered the mission canceled, the crew to abandon ship, and for the remaining ships to begin rescuing survivors. <ref>CombinedFleet.com</ref>  ''Yamato'' communicated this message to the other surviving ships by [[signal flag]], as her [[radio]]s had been destroyed.<ref>Yoshida, ''Requiem'', 108.</ref>

[[image:Yamato4.jpg|250 px|thumb|left|[[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']], afire, begins to [[capsize]]. <ref>Nova:  ''Sinking the Supership''.</ref>]]At 14:05, ''Yamato'' was stopped dead in the water and began to capsize.  Admiral Ito and the captain of the ''Yamato'' decided to go down with the ship and refused to abandon her with the rest of the survivors.  At 14:20, ''Yamato'' capsized completely and began to sink ({{coor dm|30|22|N|128|04|E}}).  At 14:23, she suddenly blew-up with an [[explosion]] so large that it was reportedly heard and seen 200&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]] away in [[Kagoshima]] and sent up a [[mushroom cloud|mushroom-shaped cloud]] almost 20,000&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]] into the air.<ref>Yoshida, ''Requiem'', 118.</ref>  The explosion is believed to have happened due to the fires from the bomb hits reaching the main [[ammunition]] [[Magazine (artillery)|magazines]]. <ref>Skulski, ''The Battleship Yamato'', 13.</ref>

Attempting to make it back to port, Japanese destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Asashimo|''Asashimo'']] was bombed and sunk with all hands by U.S. aircraft.  The Japanese destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Kasumi|''Kasumi'']] was also sunk by U.S. carrier aircraft attack during the battle.  ''Suzutsuki'', despite her [[bow (ship)|bow]] being blown off, was able to make it to [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]], Japan by steaming in reverse the entire way.<ref>CombinedFleet.com</ref>

The remaining three less-damaged Japanese destroyers ([[Japanese destroyer Fuyuzuki|''Fuyuzuki'']], [[Japanese destroyer Yukikaze|''Yukikaze'']], and [[Japanese destroyer Hatsushimo|''Hatsushimo'']]) were able to rescue 280 survivors from ''Yamato'' (out of a crew of 2,700), plus 555 survivors from ''Yahagi'' (out of a crew of 1,000) and just over 800 survivors from ''Isokaze'', ''Hamakaze'', and ''Kasumi''.  However, 3,700 Japanese naval personnel perished in the battle.<ref>CombinedFleet.com</ref>  The ships took the survivors to Sasebo.<ref>Yoshida, ''Requiem'', 140.</ref>

[[image:Yamato3.jpg|250 px|thumb|right|[[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']] explodes. <ref>Nova:  ''Sinking the Supership''.</ref>]]A total of 10 U.S. aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire from the Japanese ships; some of the aircrews were rescued by [[seaplane|amphibious aircraft]] or submarine.  In total, the U.S. lost 12 killed.  Some of the Japanese survivors reported that U.S. fighter aircraft [[machine gun|machine-gunned]] Japanese survivors floating in the water.<ref>"Then the Americans started to shoot with machine guns at the people who were floating, so we all had to dive under." {{cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/supership/surv-ishida.html | title=Survivor Stories: Ishida | author=Naoyoshi Ishida | coauthors=Keiko Bang | month=September | year=2005 | work=Sinking the Supership | publisher=[[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]] }}</ref>  This may have been a [[war crime]] or it may have been a legitimate attempt to protect downed U.S. aircrew who were floating in the water nearby awaiting rescue.<ref>Hara, ''Japanese Destroyer Captain'', 301.</ref>  Japanese survivors also reported that U.S. aircraft temporarily halted their attacks on the Japanese destroyers during the time that the destroyers were busy picking up survivors from the water. <ref>Yoshida, ''Requiem'', 144.</ref>

During the battle, the Japanese Army conducted an air attack on the U.S. naval fleet at Okinawa as promised, but failed to sink any ships.  Around 115 aircraft, many of them kamikaze, attacked the U.S. ships throughout the day of April 7.  Kamikaze aircraft hit [[USS Hancock (CV-19)|''Hancock'']], battleship [[USS Maryland (BB-46)|''Maryland'']], and destroyer [[USS Bennett (DD-473)|''Bennett'']], causing moderate damage to ''Hancock'' and ''Maryland'' and heavy damage to ''Bennett''.  About 100 of the Japanese aircraft were lost in the attack. <ref>Hara, ''Japanese Destroyer Captain'', 304.</ref>

==Aftermath==

Ten-Go was the last major Japanese naval operation of the war, and the remaining Japanese warships had little involvement in combat operations for the rest of the conflict.  ''Suzutsuki'' was never repaired.  ''Fuyuzuki'' was repaired but hit a U.S. air-dropped [[naval mine|mine]] at [[Moji-ku, Kitakyushu|Moji]], Japan, on [[August 20]], [[1945]], and was not subsequently repaired.  ''Yukikaze'' survived the war almost undamaged.  ''Hatsushimo'' hit a U.S. air-dropped mine on [[July 30]], [[1945]], near [[Maizuru, Kyoto|Maizuru]], Japan, and was the 129th, and last, Japanese destroyer sunk in the war. <ref>Hara, ''Japanese Destroyer Captain'', 281.</ref>

Okinawa was declared secure by Allied forces on [[June 21]], [[1945]],<ref>Minear, ''Requiem'', xiv.</ref> after an intense and costly battle.  [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered unconditionally]] in August 1945, after being [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombed twice with nuclear weapons by the U.S]].  The apparent willingness of Japan to sacrifice so many of their people using suicidal tactics such as Operation Ten-Go and in the Battle of Okinawa reportedly was a factor in the Allied decision to employ [[nuclear weapon]]s against Japan. <ref>Feifer, ''The Battle of Okinawa'', 410<U+2013>430.</ref>

The story of Operation Ten-Go is revered to some degree in modern Japan as evidenced by appearances of the story in popular [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]] which usually portray the event as a brave, selfless, but futile, symbolic effort by the participating Japanese sailors to defend their homeland . <ref>Matsumoto, ''Uchu senkan Yamato''; Sato, ''Otoko-tachi no Yamato''.</ref>  One of the reasons the event may have such significance in Japanese culture is that the word ''Yamato'' was often used as a poetic name for Japan itself.  Thus, the end of battleship ''Yamato'' could serve as a metaphor for the end of the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese empire]].<ref>Minear, ''Requiem'', xvii.</ref>
