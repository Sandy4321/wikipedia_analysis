"'''The Truth'''" is the collective name for the 201st and 202nd, and final, episodes of the science fiction television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. They first aired on May 19, 2002 as part of the show's [[The X-Files (season 9)|ninth season]] on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States. "The Truth" subsequently aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on September 26, 2002. It was written by creator and executive producer [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] and directed by [[Kim Manners]]. "The Truth" was the most watched episode of the [[The X-Files (season 9)|ninth season]], receiving a [[Nielsen rating]] of 7.5 and was viewed by about 13 million viewers. The finale received mixed reviews by television commentators: many criticized the episode's lack of closure while others were happy with return of Mulder as well as the episode's conclusion.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]), [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]), [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]), and [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s.  In this episode, after not knowing Mulder's whereabouts for the last year, Walter Skinner ([[Mitch Pileggi]]) and Scully learn that Mulder is being held for the murder of a military man he couldn't possibly have killed: Knowle Rohrer ([[Adam Baldwin]]), one of the government's secret "Super Soldiers". Mulder breaks out of prison with help of Skinner, Reyes, Doggett, Scully and Alvin Kersh. Mulder and Scully travel to New Mexico where Black helicopters destroy an Anasazi cliff dwelling ruin along with the [[Smoking Man|Cigarette Smoking Man]] ([[William B. Davis]]).

The episode featured the return of David Duchovny, following his departure after [[Existence (The X-Files)|the eighth season finale]], as well as several other recurring characters. "The Truth" was the [[series finale]] for ''The X-Files'', concluding many long-time story arcs while creating new ones for a possible [[The X-Files franchise|film franchise]]. Shooting took place at various California locales, including a hydroelectric power plant east of [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] and [[Anza-Borrego State Park]], located in [[Borrego Springs, California|Borrego Springs]]. Chris Carter has expressed an intent to make a third ''X-Files'' feature film that would focus on the impending alien invasion revealed in this episode, depending on the success of the 2008 film ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]''.

==Plot==
At [[Mount Weather]] military base, [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) appears with several government officials. He gains access to highly-classified documents on a secure computer system, and is shocked and dismayed to read the documents, which provide details of the final [[Colonist (The X-Files)|colonization of the planet]]. Before he can continue reading, Mulder hears another person approaching. He quickly hides and observes [[List of The X-Files characters#Knowle Rohrer|Knowle Rohrer]] ([[Adam Baldwin]]), a former friend of [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]) but who has been irreversibly transformed into an [[Colonist (The X-Files)#.22Super Soldiers.22|enemy "Super Soldier"]], approach the computer system. Rohrer immediately realizes the system has been accessed. Mulder attempts to attack Rohrer, but Rohrer easily overpowers him. Mulder frantically flees, but Rohrer outflanks him. In a violent altercation, Mulder flips Rohrer off a catwalk onto high-voltage wiring, and Rohrer apparently dies by electrocution. Mulder attempts to escape, but is quickly arrested by several soldiers.

News of Mulder's arrest spreads to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. Upon hearing that he has resurfaced, and in such a dire manner, [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) and [[Walter Skinner]] ([[Mitch Pileggi]]) immediately visit him in military custody. They learn that he had in fact made the incursion, but he wants his reason for doing so to be heard. During his time in captivity, he receives mysterious visits from two phantoms of his past: [[Alex Krycek]] ([[Nicholas Lea]]) and [[X (The X-Files)|X]] ([[Steven Williams]]). Meanwhile, Scully and Skinner go to great lengths to get him released, but are unsuccessful. Mulder's fate is ultimately made the subject of a military tribunal. At the outset, it appears Mulder will become the hopeless victim of a [[show trial]] stacked against him.

Skinner takes Mulder's defense, while Scully, [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]), Doggett, [[List of The X-Files characters#Marita Covarrubias|Marita Covarrubias]] ([[Laurie Holden]]), [[List of The X-Files characters#Gibson Praise|Gibson Praise]] (Jeff Gulka) and [[Jeffrey Spender]] ([[Chris Owens (actor)|Chris Owens]]) testify on Mulder's behalf. The prosecution presents Rohrer's body as evidence against Mulder. Aware that Rohrer is a seemingly-invincible "Super Soldier", Scully performs a medical examination and proves that the body is not that of Rohrer. Despite this, the defense is ultimately overruled, and Mulder is sentenced to death for the murder of a military officer. With the unexpected help of [[Alvin Kersh|Deputy Director Alvin Kersh]] ([[James Pickens, Jr.]]), the agents help Mulder escape. Despite being advised to immediately leave the continent via Canada, Mulder instead takes Scully to [[New Mexico]]. Doggett and Reyes find their office emptied, suggesting that the X-Files have been closed down for the third time.

Mulder and Scully arrive at [[Anasazi]] ruins to find a "wise man" who they believe can make sense of the classified documents Mulder has read. They discover the so-called "wise man" is none other than [[The Smoking Man]] ([[William B. Davis]]), who is hiding to survive the colonization <U+2013> an event that will happen on [[2012 doomsday prediction|December 21, 2012]], the predicted [[end of the world]]. Outside, Reyes and Doggett arrive and fight Rohrer, who has been sent to kill Mulder and the Smoking Man. Rohrer is killed when the [[magnetite]] in the ruins affects his superhuman body. Switching cars with Mulder and Scully, Doggett and Reyes drive off. [[Black helicopters]] destroy the cliff dwellings <U+2013> and the Smoking Man within <U+2013> before giving chase to the wrong car. Doggett and Reyes are last seen speeding away with the helicopters in pursuit.

In a motel room in [[Roswell, New Mexico]], Mulder and Scully prepare for bed and talk. Mulder explains his belief "that the dead are not lost to us. That they speak to us as part of something greater than us <U+2013> greater than any alien force. And if you and I are powerless now, I want to believe that if we listen to what's speaking, it can give us the power to save ourselves." Despite their slim chance for success, Mulder declares, "Maybe there's hope."<ref name="BBC1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/xfiles/episodeguide/nine/page19.shtml |title=The Truth |work=BBC Cult |publisher=BBC|accessdate=May 9, 2012}}</ref><ref name="BBC2">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/xfiles/episodeguide/nine/page20.shtml |title=The Truth, Part Two |work=BBC Cult |publisher=BBC|accessdate=May 9, 2012}}</ref>

The episode was written by series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]]. He later noted, "It's the end<U+2014>you don't get another chance.

The band was breaking up."<ref name="Bigbook">Hurwritz and Knowles, pp. 209<U+2013>216</ref> He expounded on the idea, saying, "Frank [Spotnitz] and I [decided] it was probably time to go [<U+2026>] it was strange to be writing these things knowing it was the last time we'd see Scully doing certain things or hear Mulder saying certain things."<ref name="truthtruth"/> Spotnitz explained, "What was kind of nice that Chris made the announcement in January is that we had times to wrap our minds around the end and plan for it and give all of the characters their due."<ref name="truthtruth">{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] et al |year=2002 |title=The Truth Behind Season 9: "The Truth" |medium= DVD |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> [[Annabeth Gish]] later said, "I have a great respect for the elegant in which they're closing the curtain".<ref name="reflect"/> [[Bruce Harwood]] called the finale the "passing of a generation".<ref name="reflect">{{cite video |people=[[Paul Rabwin]] |year=2002 |title=Reflections on the Truth |location= ''[[The X-Files (season 9)|The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season]]'' |medium= DVD |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>

Several of the scenes feature elements that call-back to other episodes. The final scene in which Mulder and Scully speak in a hotel room is reminiscent of the series' [[Pilot (The X-Files)|first episode]]. In addition, the [[The X-Files (season 2)|second season]] episode "[[Red Museum]]," featured the adherents of the Red Museum, who believed that the year 2012 will bring about the dawning of The New Age.<ref>{{Cite episode | title = Red Museum |credits = Win Phelps (Director) | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (Writer) | accessdate = January 15, 2011 | series = The X-Files | serieslink = The X-Files | network = Fox | airdate = December 9, 1994 | season =3 | number = 10}}</ref><ref name=myth2>{{cite news | url=http://www.entil2001.com/series/x-files/reviews/season2/2-10.html | title=Red Museum |last=Keegan|first=John | publisher=Critical Myth | accessdate=May 22, 2012 }}</ref> In "The Truth," it is revealed to Mulder by the [[Smoking Man|Cigarette Smoking Man]] that the [[Colonists (The X-Files)|alien colonists]] plan to colonize the earth on [[2012 phenomenon|December 22, 2012]], an event that countless cultures, including most notably the [[Maya peoples|Mayans]], predicted.<ref name=myth2/><ref>{{Cite episode | title = The Truth |credits = [[Kim Manners]] (Director) | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (Writer) | accessdate = January 15, 2011 | series = The X-Files | serieslink = The X-Files | network = Fox | airdate = May 19, 2002 | season =9 | number = 19 & 20}}</ref><ref name="shear"/>

===Casting===
[[File:David Duchovny 2011 Shankbone.JPG|"The Truth" marked [[David Duchovny]]'s return as [[Fox Mulder]].|200px|thumb|right]]
With this episode, [[David Duchovny]] rejoined the main cast of ''The X-Files'' after his departure following the eighth season finale "[[Existence (The X-Files)|Existence]]". The episode marks the only time that all five principal actors<U+2014>Duchovny, Anderson, Patrick, Gish, and Pileggi<U+2014>are credited together in the opening titles. Mulder, Scully, and the The Smoking Man are the only characters to appear in both this episode and the series' [[The X-Files (pilot episode)|pilot]]. This episode is the fourth of only four episodes in [[The X-Files (season 9)|season nine]] where Duchovny appeared, the others being "[[Trust No 1]]", "[[Jump the Shark (The X-Files)|Jump the Shark]]", and "[[William (The X-Files)|William]]". Duchovny appeared in the first two via archival footage and only made a small cameo in the third.<ref name="williammulder">Kessenich, p. 204</ref> The episode marks the return of several characters who had either previously been killed-off or had left the show, including [[X (The X-Files)|X]], who was killed in the [[The X-Files (season 4)|season four]] opener "[[Herrenvolk (The X-Files)|Herrenvolk]]";<ref name="herrenvolk">{{cite episode| episodelink= Herrenvolk (The X-Files)| title= Herrenvolk | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[R.

Originally, this episode was to feature [[recurring character]] [[List of The X-Files characters#Shannon McMahon|Shannon McMahon]]. However, actress [[Lucy Lawless]] became pregnant shortly after filming the two-parter "[[Nothing Important Happened Today]]" and was not available for subsequent episodes.<ref name="Commentary"/> Actress Julia Vera was called in to play the role of the woman who is helping the Smoking Man live in the Anasazi ruins. Vera had previously appeared in the sixth season two-part episode "[[Dreamland (The X-Files)|Dreamland]]". She later called the opportunity "amazing" and declared that "my greatest experience was ''The X-Files''".<ref>Fraga, p. 222</ref> The final scene of the episode was originally going to feature the [[List of The X-Files characters#Toothpick Man|Toothpick Man]] informing [[George W. Bush]], played by actor Gary Newton, of Mulder's escape. The scene was filmed, but was not included in the broadcast version; executive producer Frank Spotnitz later said that he was "so happy" that the producers cut the scene, noting that<U+2014>despite "a lot of debate about it, on both sides"<U+2014>the scene was unable to top the final scene with Mulder and Scully.<ref name="deleted scene">{{cite video |people=[[Frank Spotnitz]] |year=2002 |title=Deleted Scenes with Optional Commentary by Frank Spotnitz: Scene 77 <U+2013> President Bush |location=''[[The X-Files (season 9)|The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season]]''  |medium= DVD |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> During the DVD's audio commentary, the producers mentioned that they had considered filming the shot on the Oval Office set created by ''[[The West Wing]]''. In addition, they originally wanted to have [[Martin Sheen]] appear as his ''[[The West Wing]]'' character [[Josiah Bartlet]] instead of Bush, noting that the cameo would have been "a nice, sorta of wink" to the television audience.<ref name="deleted scene"/> Despite being cut from the final episode, the shot was featured as a deleted scene on the season nine DVD.<ref name="deleted scene"/>

===Filming===
[[File:Fontspoint02262006.JPG|The Anasazi ruins were filmed at [[Anza-Borrego State Park]].|250px|thumb|left]]
The first scene, featuring Mulder breaking into a military base, was shot in a hydroelectric power plant east of [[Fresno, California]]. The rooms seen in the episode were the main rooms for the power plant. ''[[The X-Files]]'' crew turned it into what they called a "war room". Most of the decoration and interior scene was done by the visual effect crew; the only visible part seen in real life was a large generator that pumped water. Bill Roe, the cinematographer for the episode, spent four to five days to light the set for filming. [[Kim Manners]] commented on his work and called it "a great job". The main computer terminal room was shot at a sound stage at [[20th Century Fox]]; the crew built the set themselves. The scenes with Mulder being tortured by the military guards were shot at [[Fort MacArthur]], an abandoned military base in [[Long Beach, California]], as well as The Marine Mammal Care Center in [[San Pedro, California]].<ref name="Commentary">{{cite video |people=[[Kim Manners|Manners, Kim]] |year=2002 |title=Audio Commentary for "The Truth" |location=''[[The X-Files (season 9)|The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season]]'' DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|FOX Home Entertainment]]}}</ref><ref name="fraga">Fraga, p. 237<U+2013>238</ref> Filming the court room was one of the "most challenging sequences" Manners had ever done.<ref name="Commentary"/> Carter wanted the courtroom to have no spectators and no jury. This meant that Manners had to shot each scene with a limited amount of actors and make them look "fresh".<ref name="Commentary"/> Manners was terrified to film the 40-page long courtroom scene, pointing out that the show was basically re-telling a nine-year history of ''The X-Files''. Corey Kaplan designed the set.<ref name="Commentary"/>

The Anasazi ruins were constructed in [[Anza-Borrego State Park]], located in [[Borrego Springs, California]]. Location manager Mac Gordon later noted that, due to the presence of a rare "spiny black horned toad" in the area, he and his crew hire several biologists to locate any lizards in the area and move them elsewhere. In addition, Gordon had a difficult time persuading the park rangers to build and then blow up faux-ruins. He explained, "we were on a state park property that was an off road park, with motorcycles and ATV's flying all over the place, but they still blanched when I said we have to build Indian ruins and then blow it up."<ref name="fraga"/> However, the cameo of The Smoking Man was filmed on a sound stage back at 20th Century Fox. Manners noted that Davis had "a hell of a time" trying to smoke his cigarettes through a hole in his neck, due to the fact that the hole was fake.<ref name="Commentary"/> The scene featuring The Smoking Man being burnt up by a missile was done via computer animation. The missiles were created via CGI technology by animator Mat Beck. The helicopter, however included real smoke bombs. A shot of William B. Davis was overlapped with fire, and eventually a skull to give the effect that The Smoking Man's flesh was burnt away. Paul Rabwin later called the scene a "great sequence".<ref name="sfx">{{cite video |people=[[Paul Rabwin]] |year=2002 |title=Special Effects by Mat Beck with Commentary by Paul Rabwin <U+2013> "CSM Incinerates" |location= ''[[The X-Files (season 9)|The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season]]'' |medium= DVD |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>

The last shot filmed for the episode was the scene wherein Anderson handed David the baby in her bedroom.<ref name="Bigbook"/> Manners called the last scene with Duchovny and Anderson "extremely tough."<ref name="Commentary"/> He noted, "We got the shot, and we cut it and printed it; the nurse came and took the baby away and David put his arms around Gillian, and she put her arms around him, and they stood there for about 10 minutes [<U+2026>] It was truly one of the most emotional experiences I've ever witnessed in my life."<ref name="Bigbook"/> The scene was filmed at an actual motel, called La Cresenta. The location had previously been used in "[[Sein Und Zeit (The X-Files)|Sein Und Zeit]]" and "[[This is Not Happening]]".<ref name="fraga"/>

== Reception ==

The episode earned a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen household rating]] of 7.5, meaning that it was seen by 7.5% of the nation's estimated households.<ref name=ratingap>{{cite journal|last=Associated Press|title=Prime-Time Nielsen ratings|journal=Associated Press Archive|year=2002|month=May|accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref>  It was viewed by 7.91 million households<ref name=ratingap/>{{#tag:ref|At the time of airing, there were 105.5 million TV homes.<ref name=ratingap/> Thus, 7.5 percent of 105.5 million is 7.91 million households.|group="nb"}} and gathered a total of 13 million viewers in the United States alone.<ref>{{cite journal|title=ARTS & TV in Brief 'Survivor: Marquesas' outwits the competition|journal=Boston Herald|year=2002|month=May|pages=48|accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref> On the date of its airing, the episode was ranked third, behind the season finale of ''[[Survivor: Marquesas]]'' and the heavily promoted ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' reunion.<ref name=ratings>{{cite journal|last=McCollum|first=Charlie|title='X-Files' Finale Posts Ratings Way Out There|journal=San Jose Mercury News|year=2002|month=May|pages=8F|accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref> "The Truth" did, however, place ahead of the season finale of ''[[The Practice]]''.<ref name=ratings/> In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the episode made its first appearance on [[Sky1]] on September 26, 2002 and received 1.03 million viewers, placing ''The X-Files'' number two in the top ten broadcasts for Sky1 for that week behind ''[[The Simpsons]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?RequestTimeout=500&report=weeklytop30 |title=BARB's multichannel top 10 programmes |publisher=barb.co.uk |accessdate=August 1, 2009}} <small>Note: Information is in the section titled "w/e 23<U+2013>29 Sept, 2002", listed under Sky 1</small></ref>

The episode received mixed reviews by critics; the main reason for criticism was that, instead of creating a conclusion, the episode created new questions for the audience. [[Robert Shearman]] and [[Lars Pearson]], in their book ''Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen'', gave the episode a scathing review and awarded it one star out of five.<ref name="shear">Shearman and Pearson, pp. 278<U+2013>280</ref> The two, despite calling the opening "promising", derided the episode's ending<U+2014>especially the revelation of alien colonization of December 22, 2012<U+2014>writing, "is this really what the series was about?"<ref name="shear"/> Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson concluded that, "the problem [with the episode] is more than this is how a series which has been brilliant<U+2014>frequently, truly brilliant<U+2014>chooses to define itself in the summing up."<ref name="shear"/> [[UGO]] named the episode the fourteenth "Worst Series Finale" and wrote that the episode<U+2014>and the show's eighth and ninth season by extension<U+2014>were negatively affected by the series' lack of a defining plot line. The article noted, "Fox demanded the additional seasons despite the main storylines being wrapped up [but] while most everyone [...] returned [for 'The Truth'], the trial of Mulder ultimately resulted in very little satisfying payoff to the series overarching mysteries".<ref>{{cite web|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Kevin|title=TV's Worst Series Finales|url=http://www.ugo.com/tv/worst-series-finales?page=3|publisher=[[UGO]]|accessdate=6 June 2012|date=16 March 2011}}</ref> A review from ''The New York Times'', after the premiere of "The Truth", said of the show, "The most imaginative show on television has finally reached the limits of its imagination."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/10/10/1034061299444.html | title=The Nearly Ex Files|work=The New York Times | date=October 10, 2002 | accessdate=August 17, 2009 }}</ref>

Not all reviews were so critical. In 2011, the finale was ranked No. 22 on the [[TV Guide Network]] special, ''TV's Most Unforgettable Finales''.<ref>{{Cite episode | title =TV's Most Unforgettable Finales | accessdate = May 9, 2012 | network = [[TV Guide Network]] | date = May 22, 2011}}</ref> John Keegan gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it a 7 out of 10. He noted, "Overall, I can<U+2019>t say that this episode gave me answers. I can<U+2019>t say that this episode wrapped up all of the plot threads. I certainly can<U+2019>t say that this episode was the best episode of the series. But I can say that after watching this episode, I am glad that the series is over. Anything more would have strained the dignity of the series even more than nine years already had.
