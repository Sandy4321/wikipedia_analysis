'''Joseph Charles Buttler''', commonly known as '''Jos Buttler''', (born 8 September 1990) is an English [[cricket]]er who plays for [[Somerset County Cricket Club]].  He is a right-handed [[Batting (cricket)|batsman]] who also plays as a [[wicket-keeper]].  Buttler enjoyed a prolific cricket record while at school, sharing a record-breaking opening [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] while at [[King's College, Taunton]] in 2008, and the following season his school lost only one of seventeen matches under captaincy, and he was named 2009 [[Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year|''Young Wisden'' Schools Cricketer of the Year]].  He made his Somerset first-team debut in 2009.  His performances led him to be selected to play for England at [[English U-19 cricket team|Under-19]] level, touring [[Bangladesh]], and then travelling to [[New Zealand]] for the [[2010 Under19 Cricket World Cup|2010 Under-19 Cricket World Cup]].

The highlight of his school career came in April 2008, when he scored 227 [[not out]] during a record-breaking opening [[Partnership (cricket)|stand]] in a 50-over national schools game, adding 340 with Alex Barrow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/7375597.stm |title=King's duo break schools record |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=2008-04-30 |accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref>  He [[Captain (cricket)|captained]] King's during the 2008 season, and improved on his batting totals from the previous two years, scoring 851 runs, over 250 more than any other member of the team.<ref>{{cite book |last=Henderson |first=Douglas |editor1-first=Scyld |editor1-last=Berry |title=Wisden Cricketer's Almanack 2009 |edition=146 |year=2009 |publisher=John Wisden & Co.

With captain [[Carl Gazzard]] keeping wicket in the majority of these matches, Buttler played purely as a batsman, although in his final match of the season for the team, he kept wicket and claimed six catches in the first-innings against Worcestershire Second XI.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/158/158388.html |title=Worcestershire Second XI v Somerset Second XI |publisher=CricketArchive |date=2008-09-10 |accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>  In the previous match, against Hampshire Second XI, Buttler had made 140 batting from [[Batting order (cricket)|number four]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/158/158384.html |title=Somerset Second XI v Hampshire Second XI |publisher=CricketArchive |date=2008-09-03 |accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>  

He made his [[First-class cricket|first-class]] debut for [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] in September 2009, replacing the injured [[Justin Langer]] for the [[County Championship]] match against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]], scoring 30 in his only innings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisiswesternmorningnews.co.uk/cricket/Horton-ton-cancels-Somerset-s-early-gains/article-1326971-detail/article.html|title=Horton ton cancels out Somerset gains|date=2009-09-10|work=Western Morning News|accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref>  He retained his place in the team for the following [[Pro40]] match against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]], making his [[List A cricket|List A]] debut, although he was not required to bat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/204/204641.html |title=Hampshire v Somerset |publisher=CricketArchive |date=2009-09-13 |accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref>  Selected as part of the Somerset squad for the [[2009 Champions League Twenty20]], Buttler made his debut in the 20-over format of the game in Somerset's final match of the league stage, remaining six not out at the close of the innings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/251/251438.html |title=New South Wales v Somerset |publisher=CricketArchive |date=2009-10-18 |accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref>  Buttler again captained King's in 2009, and in the seventeen matches under his leadership they lost only once, and also won the Western School Twenty20 competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.somersetcountycc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/Newsdetail/0,,11333~2025849,00.html |publisher=[[Somerset County Cricket Club]] |title=JOS BUTTLER LIFTS WISDEN SCHOOL'S CRICKETER OF YEAR |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref>  Coupled with his 554 runs for the school at an average of 61.55, and his performances for Somerset, he was named 2010 [[Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year|''Young Wisden'' Schools Cricketer of the Year]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisden.com/default.aspx?id=3 |title=The Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year |work=''Wisden'' |publisher=John Wisden & Co. |accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref>

===First-team opportunity===
With [[Craig Kieswetter]] called up into the [[England cricket team|England]] one-day side in 2010, Buttler was given the chance of a prolonged run in Somerset's first team.  [[Brian Rose (cricketer)|Brian Rose]], Somerset's Director of Cricket, chose not to bring in an experienced keeper to deputise, explaining that Kieswetter had been in a similar position three years earlier, and that he had good reports of Buttler's ability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Somerset-hopeful-Buttler-set-profit-Kieswetter-s-England-heroics/article-1862840-detail/article.html |title=Ambitious Buttler ready to stand in for Kieswetter |work=[[The Herald (Plymouth)|The Herald]] |publisher=[[Northcliffe Media]] |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref>  In his first match of the 2010 season, Buttler remained 22 not out at the close of Somerset's innings, posting his first runs in [[List A cricket]], and he followed this up with two catches to help Somerset beat [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] in their opening [[Clydesdale Bank 40]] fixture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/262/262613.html |title=Glamorgan v Somerset |publisher=CricketArchive |date=2010-04-25 |accessdate=2010-05-10}}</ref>.  He made his maiden first-class century in his fourth [[County Championship]] match, scoring 144 runs in an innings characterised by "dogged determination and [a] decent range of shots".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/counties/8681073.stm |title=Hampshire draw with Somerset as poor start continues |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=2010-05-13 |accessdate=2010-05-14}}</ref>

==International career==
Buttler's first taste of international cricket came in July 2008, when he represented England Under-17s in two warm-up matches against [[New Zealand U-19 cricket team|New Zealand Under-19s]].  Batting at number five, he scored a rapid 77 not out in the 50-over contest, hitting 11 fours and 2 sixes during the 49 deliveries he faced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/251/251728.html |title=England Under-17s v New Zealand Under-19s |publisher=CricketArchive |date=2008-07-21 |accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref>  He also played in the two-day match between the two teams, scoring 45 in the first-innings as the match was drawn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/251/251729.html |title=England Under-17s v New Zealand Under-19s |publisher=CricketArchive |date=2008-07-22 |accessdate-2010-05-03}}</ref>  In 2009, Buttler played four matches for England Under-18s, two each against Scotland A and Scotland Development XI.  He scored 103 not out in the first of these matches,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/259/259918.html |title=Scotland A v England Under-18s |publisher=CricketArchive |date=2009-05-26 |accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref> and made starts in each of the following matches, reaching double figures on each occasion, but not scoring higher than 28.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/259/259919.html |title=Scotland A v England Under-18s |publisher=CricketArchive |date=2009-05-27 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/259/259921.html |title=Scotland Development XI v England Under-18s |publisher=CricketArchive |date=2009-05-29 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/259/259920.html |title=Scotland Development XI v England Under-18s |publisher=CricketArchive |date=2009-05-29 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}</ref>  Two months later, Buttler made his [[English U-19 cricket team|England Under-19]] debut, appearing in the first [[Twenty20]] against [[Bangladesh U-19 cricket team|Bangladesh Under-19s]].  Playing as a specialist batsman, he scored 33 runs off 17 balls as England won by five wickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/247/247628.html |title=England Under-19s v Bangladesh Under-19s |publisher=CricketArchive |date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref>

During the 2009&ndash;10 English winter, Buttler toured with the England Under-19 team.  He joined up with the squad in Bangladesh following Somerset's elimination from the Champions League Twenty20 for the seven-match youth [[One Day International|ODI]] series.  As with his previous appearance for the Under-19s, Buttler played as a specialist batsman,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/308967.html?class=21;filter=advanced;keeper=1;orderby=default;template=results;type=allround |title=Statistics / Statsguru / JC Buttler / Under-19s Youth One-Day Internationals |publisher=Cricinfo |accessdate=2010-05-15}}</ref> but failed to make a significant impact until the final match when he scored 42 runs, though Bangladesh still won the match to claim the series 5&ndash;2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/253/253860.html |title=Bangladesh Under-19s v England Under-19s |publisher=CricketArchive |date=2009-11-04 |accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref>  He remained with the team for the [[2010 Under19 Cricket World Cup|Under-19 World Cup]], where he played all but one of England's six matches, keeping wicket in three of them.  He scored 91 runs in three innings, with a top-score of 78 against [[Indian U-19 cricket team|India]] in the fifth-place play-off semi-final.  His batting average of 30.33 ranked him fifth on the England team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/NZ/ICC_Under-19_World_Cup_2009-10/England_Under-19s_Batting.html |title= Batting and Fielding for England Under-19s: ICC Under-19 World Cup 2009/10 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref>
