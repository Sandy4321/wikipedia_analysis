'''Mam Sonando''' (Khmer: <U+1798><U+17C9><U+1798> <U+179F><U+17BC><U+178E><U+1784><U+17CB><U+178A><U+17BC>) (born c. 1941{{efn|Seventy-one years old in 2012<ref name=BP/>}}) is a radio journalist with Cambodian and French [[dual citizenship]].<ref name=OMCT /> He is the owner and director of [[Phnom Penh]]'s [[Beehive Radio]], which the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] (CPJ) described in 2012 as "one of Cambodia's few independent news outlets".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpj.org/2012/10/cambodian-court-sentences-journalist-to-20-years.php |title=Cambodian court sentences journalist to 20 years |date=1 October 2012 |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |accessdate=10 April 2013 |archivedate=10 April 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6FmP40YlN |deadurl=no}}</ref> He also acts as a political commentator for the station. 

Sonando has been imprisoned three times on charges related to his reporting: a 2003 arrest for "inciting riots", a 2005 arrest for defamation, and a 2012 arrest for insurrection.<ref name=CPJ>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpj.org/2012/07/cambodian-broadcaster-detained-on-insurrection-cha.php |title=Cambodian broadcaster detained on insurrection charges |date=17 July 2012 |publisher=The Committee to Protect Journalists |accessdate=1 August 2012|archivedate=16 March 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6FAjCqYk3 |deadurl=no}}</ref> His twenty-year prison sentence for the latter was protested by human rights groups, and US President [[Barack Obama]] expressed concerns about the case in a meeting with Prime Minister [[Hun Sen]]. The sentence was overturned by an appeals court in March 2013, and Sonando was instead given a five-year suspended sentence on charges of causing civil unrest.

== Biography ==
Born in Cambodia, Sonando traveled to Paris in 1964 for school. He left Cambodia again in 1975 to avoid the rule of the [[Khmer Rouge]], remaining in France until 1993. That year, he returned to Cambodia and acquired a broadcasting license for a new station which he named Beehive Radio. He used the station to advertise a new political party, the Beehive Democratic Society Party, and stood in the [[Cambodian parliamentary election, 1998|1988 parliamentary election]]. According to the ''[[Asia Times]]'', his campaign only won him "a reputation as an eccentric, spouting Buddhist philosophy, pleas for democracy and a personal campaign for attention."<ref name=AT/> After failing to be elected, Sonando dissolved his party, but continued broadcasting on Beehive Radio as an independent journalist.<ref name=AT/>

Sonando is the owner and director of [[Beehive Radio]].<ref name=BP/> In 2012, [[Human Rights Watch]] described Beehive Radio as "a key platform for promotion of human rights and democracy in Cambodia".<ref name=HRW /> The station is one of the few to address controversial topics, including "Cambodian civil society, the fight against HIV/AIDS, maternal mortality and human trafficking, campaigns for women's rights and gender equality, political and economic transparency, equitable and sustainable development, labor rights, environmental protection, the rule of law, and electoral education and election monitoring."<ref name=HRW /> It also carries programming by [[Radio Free Asia]], [[Voice of America]],<ref name=RFA/> the [[Cambodian Center for Human Rights]],<ref name=AT/> and [[Radio France Internationale]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Journalism Education in Countries With Limited Media Freedom |last=Beate Ursula Josephi |year=2010 |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=9781433110849 |page=58 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dtVCrRifAiEC&pg=PA58&dq=Mam+Sonando&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tvtEUYv1A-Td2QWItYGAAQ&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Mam%20Sonando&f=false |accessdate=16 March 2013}}</ref>

The station is funded by a combination of advertising and private donations. Some companies have declined to advertise with Beehive Radio due to its occasionally controversial reporting and political stances. Sonando also refuses to run advertisements for "vice" products, including cigarettes.<ref>{{cite book |title=Advertising in Developing and Emerging Countries: |last=Emmanuel C.

== 2003 arrest ==
In January 2003, [[2003 Phnom Penh riots|riots broke out]] in Phnom Penh after a Cambodian newspaper incorrectly reported that a Thai actress had stated [[Angkor Wat]] properly belonged to Thailand. On 29 January, the Thai embassy was burned, and hundreds of Thai immigrants fled the country to avoid the violence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2708499.stm |title=Cambodia apologises to Thais |date=30 January 2003 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=1 August 2012|archivedate=16 March 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6FAjNqPoY |deadurl=no}}</ref> During the riots, a caller to Beehive Radio claimed incorrectly that Cambodian embassy officials were killed in Bangkok. On 31 January, Sonando was arrested and accused of "relaying false information", "inciting discrimination", and "inciting crime".<ref name=BBC103 /> He stated to reporters, "They blame me for broadcasting an opinion of a listener which turned out to be untrue. But if I have to go to jail to allow people to express their opinion I am happy."<ref name=BBC103>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2712027.stm |title=Radio boss charged over Cambodian riots |date=31 January 2003 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=1 August 2012|archivedate=16 March 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6FAjamnzA |deadurl=no}}</ref>

== 2005 arrest ==
Sonando was arrested again on 11 October 2005 after reporting on Prime Minister [[Hun Sen]]'s [[Cambodia<U+2013>Vietnam relations#Recent events|treaty with Vietnam]] settling the two nations' border dispute; the report included a discussion with a French-based expert who criticized Hun Sen's concessions. Sonando was charged with "criminal defamation", "disseminating false information", and "incitement".<ref name=CPJ05 /> On 3 November, he was denied bail.<ref name=CPJ05>{{cite web |url=http://cpj.org/2005/11/cpj-condemns-detention-of-radio-journalist-in-lett.php |title=CPJ condemns detention of radio journalist in letter to Hun Sen |author=Ann Cooper |date=18 November 2005 |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |accessdate=1 August 2012|archivedate=16 March 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6FAjlKHi2 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

Sonando's arrest was criticized by the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]].<ref name=CPJ05 /> A coalition of 70 Cambodian civil society organizations also pushed for his release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ifex.org/cambodia/2005/10/27/civil_society_leaders_push_for/ |title=Civil society leaders push for release of jailed media members |date=27 October 2005 |publisher=International Freedom of Expression Exchange |accessdate=1 August 2012|archivedate=16 March 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6FAjlp4EP |deadurl=no}}</ref> CPJ condemned the arrest as part of a "broad crackdown on freedom of expression",<ref name=CPJ05 /> and [[Amnesty International]] named him a [[prisoner of conscience]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/155/ |title=Cambodia: Opposition leader convicted in flawed trial |date=23 December 2005 |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=1 August 2012|archivedate=16 March 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6FAjmDGfe |deadurl=no}}</ref>

In late January 2006, Sonando was granted bail ahead of a visit by US Assistant Secretary of State [[Christopher R. Hill]].

== 2012 arrest ==
In mid-2012, Beehive Radio reported on an [[International Court of Justice]] complaint against Prime Minister Hun Sen blaming him for the 2010 [[Phnom Penh stampede]], in which 347&nbsp;people were killed. The report sparked a new series of disputes between Sonando and Hun Sen.<ref name=E2013 /> On 26 June 2012, Hun Sen called for Sonando's arrest while Sonando was out of the country, accusing him of heading a separatist plot in [[Krati<U+00E9> Province]] to break it away from the rest of the nation. From 15 to 17 May, the province had been the site of a protest against evictions for a new rubber plant that residents accused of "land-grabbing".<ref name=HRW>{{cite web |url=http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/17/cambodia-after-us-asean-leave-media-critic-jailed |title=Cambodia: After US, ASEAN Leave, Media Critic Jailed |date=17 July 2012 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=1 August 2012|archivedate=16 March 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6FAjN2XGH |deadurl=no}}</ref> On the final day of the protests, soldiers opened fire on a crowd of families, killing a 14-year-old girl.<ref name=AC /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2012051656190/National-news/two-shot-dead-in-kratie-land-eviction.html |title=Teenage girl shot dead in Kratie land eviction |date=16 May 2012 |author=May Titthara |work=Phnom Penh Post |accessdate=1 August 2012}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Though Sonando returned during the 2012 [[ASEAN]] meeting, he was not arrested until 15 July, a few days after its end.<ref name=HRW /> 

Hun Sen accused Sonando of attempting to create a "state within a state",<ref name=E2013 /> and Sonando was formally charged with "insurrection" and "inciting people to take up weapons against state".<ref name=BP>{{cite web |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/302947/cambodian-govt-critic-faces-trial |title=Cambodian govt critic faces trial |date=17 July 2012 |work=The Bangkok Post |accessdate=1 August 2012|archivedate=16 March 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6FAjBITNa |deadurl=no}}</ref> The charges carried a maximum sentence of 30&nbsp;years in prison.<ref name=AFP>{{cite news |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gqJrYhaFgTRDfFl9hY1D-I9lmtPQ?docId=CNG.677603afc5efb606df47df0f86a41039.111 |title=Cambodian govt critic faces trial |date=17 July 2012 |publisher=Google News |agency=Agence France-Presse |accessdate=1 August 2012|archivedate=16 March 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6FAkBdSfN |deadurl=no}}</ref> Secessionist charges were also brought against several community activists from the province.<ref name=AC />

According to [[Ou Virak]] of the Cambodian Center for Human Rights, Sonando was then imprisoned in a cell shared with 17&nbsp;other people, leaving him "half a square meter [5 square feet] to sleep in".<ref name=AC>{{cite web |url=http://asiancorrespondent.com/86422/sonando-beehive-prama-secessionism/ |title=Mam Sonando arrest: Cambodia silences a journalist |author=Clothilde Le Coz |date=24 July 2012 |work=Asian Correspondent |accessdate=1 August 2012|archivedate=16 March 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6FAk7WfnZ |deadurl=no}}</ref> On 22 July, he was moved to a prison hospital on account of illness.<ref name=RFA />

Sonando's arrest quickly generated domestic and international criticism. A coalition of 22&nbsp;Cambodian rights groups, known as the Cambodian Human Rights Action Committee, called on the government to free Sonando "to save the country's reputation".<ref name=BP/> Members of Beehive Radio and the Association of Democrats protested in front of Phnom Penh's [[Royal Palace, Phnom Penh|royal palace]] on 23 July.<ref name=RFA>{{cite web |url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/mam-sonando-07232012134021.html |title=Jailed Radio Station Chief Ill |date=23 July 2012 |author=Uon Chhin and Vichey Ananddh |publisher=Radio Free Asia |accessdate=1 August 2012|archivedate=16 March 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6FAjNS5cz |deadurl=no}}</ref>

CPJ called for Sonado's immediate release, stating that Hun Sen had "a well-worn history of leveling unsubstantiated anti-state charges against journalists to stifle criticism of the administration."<ref name=CPJ /> Human Rights Watch said that "Sonando's arrest on the heels of [US Secretary of State Hillary] Clinton's visit is a brazen signal that Hun Sen thinks that the US wants his cooperation on other matters so much that he isn't afraid to lower the boom on his critics".<ref name=BP/> Amnesty International again named Sonando a prisoner of conscience, "held for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amnestyghana.org/urgent-action-government-critic-detained/ |title=Urgent Action: Government Critic Detained |date=1 August 2012 |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=1 August 2012|archivedate=16 March 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6FAkC0ioU |deadurl=no}}</ref> The [[International Federation for Human Rights]] and the [[World Organisation Against Torture]] issued a joint statement noting that they were "gravely concerned" about the charges and calling for Sonando's immediate release.<ref name=OMCT>{{cite web |url=http://www.omct.org/human-rights-defenders/urgent-interventions/cambodia/2012/07/d21872/ |title=Cambodia: Independent radio station director Mam Sonando arrested and charged |date=July 2012 |publisher=World Organisation Against Torture |accessdate=1 August 2012|archivedate=16 March 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6FAjCSpjV |deadurl=no}}</ref> [[Reporters Without Borders]] described the arrest as "like a parting slap to all those who attended last week's ASEAN summit in Phnom Penh.

An appeals court overturned Sonando's conviction on anti-state charges on 14 March 2013, finding that there had been no evidence to convict him.
