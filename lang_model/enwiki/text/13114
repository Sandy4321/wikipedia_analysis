"'''Cowboys Are Frequently, Secretly Fond of Each Other'''" (1981) is a song by [[Latin music|Latin]] country musician [[Ned Sublette]], whose music, according to Howard Cohen, features a "[[Swung note|lilting]] West Texas [[waltz]] (3/4 time at about 60<U+2013>90 beats per minute) feel".<ref name="Miami Herald">Cohen, Howard (5 March 2006)."[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_multi=MH|&p_product=MH&p_theme=realcities2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_site=miamii&s_trackval=MH&s_dispstring=Fond%20memories%20ride%20in%20on%20the%20%27Brokeback%27%20craze%20AND%20&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=%28Fond%20memories%20ride%20in%20on%20the%20%27Brokeback%27%20craze%29&xcal_numdocs=20&p_perpage=50&p_sort=YMD_date:D&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=before%2005/04/2012&xcal_useweights=no "Fond memories ride in on the 'Brokeback' craze"], ''[[Miami Herald]]'' archive.{{Subscription required}} Miami Herald Media Co.

Nelson appeared on the movie's soundtrack with the traditional "He Was a Friend of Mine"<ref name="365gay" /> which made the US charts at number 54.<ref name="BBC">(15 February 2006) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4715822.stm "Nelson releases gay cowboy song"], ''BBC NEWS''.

Nelson himself described the release in a prepared statement to Dallas Morning News:<ref name=Reuters /> "The song's been in [[the closet]] for 20 years. The timing's right for it to come out. I'm just opening the door." The song's release was encouraged by the [[coming out]] of his friend and tour manager of thirty years, David Anderson, two years ago.

===Reception===
Nelson's version of the song is his highest charting solo single since his 1984 duet with [[Julio Iglesias]] "To All the Girls I've Loved Before" (number 5),<ref name="Miami Herald" /> debuting at number 52 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, which Nelson last appeared on with the Toby Keith duet "Beer for My Horses".<ref name="Billboard">Hope, Clover (23 February 2006).

Retrieved 8 May 2007.</ref> The song has also been well received by critics.  [[Pitchfork Media]]'s Stephen M. Deusner rated the song four out of four stars despite calling it, "even more of a stunt than his reggae album" (2005's ''[[Countryman (album)|Countryman]]''). Saying that the song sounds written by Nelson, and that his performance raises the piece above the level of a cheap gag, he felt that it adds, "a whole new level of complexity to the outlaw mythology Willie helped to cultivate in the 70s."<ref name="Pitchfork Media">Deusner, Stephen M. (2 February 2006). {{Wayback |date=20080310174715 |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/track_review/31045-cowboys-are-frequently-secretly-fond-of-each-other |title="Track Reviews: Willie Nelson: 'Cowboys Are Frequently, Secretly (Fond of Each Other)'"}}, ''[[Pitchfork Media]]''.

Nelson also says that he has received very few negative reactions: "Every now and then somebody might get a little offended. It's got bad language in it, so I just don't do it in my shows. Anybody wants to hear it can hear it on iTunes. But you know people are listenin' to it, likin' it. Every now and then somebody don't like it, but that's okay. Similar to years ago, when the hippie thing come out and I started growin' my hair and puttin' the earring in, I got a little flak here and there."<ref name="Time" />

However, some sources<ref name="Tarradell" /><ref name="365gay" />  speculate about the potential success and reception of the song. Nelson explains that he didn't think, "it took a lot of balls to put the song out" saying, "first of all, I didn't think anybody would play it. I didn't think it would get on the air, but sure enough it did" though not on country stations: "Oh no, they're not gonna play it".<ref name="Time" />

WXBX, a country station in Johnson City, Tenn., devoted one morning show to a listener discussion of Nelson's release, concluding that, "the audience was disappointed in [Nelson]" and, as Nelson thought, that they "probably wouldn't be interested in much airplay".<ref name="PlanetOut">Gerome, John (Associated Press). {{Wayback |date=20071107051214 |url=http://www.planetout.com/entertainment/news/?sernum=1186 |title="Nashville stars reach out on movie soundtracks"}}, ''[[PlanetOut.com]]'' (later at ''[[Gay.com]]'').

Retrieved 7 May 2007.)</ref> PlanetOut offered the opinion that Nelson's fan base is secure and broad enough (including "hippies, rednecks and outlaws young and old") to take risks with LGBT-themed songs and soundtracks, while the WXBX station manager pointed out that Nelson has not been a mainstream country star for a while.<ref name="PlanetOut"/> Nelson's broad audience, and part of the appeal of the song, may be that, "Willie speaks his mind about any subject ... That's one of those things that has made him so endearing to so many generations of fans".<ref name=Caballeros />

The song has been described variously as "[[deadpan]]",<ref name="Tarradell" /><ref name="MSNBC">17 February 2006. [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11356491/from/RSS/ "Willie Nelson releases homage to gay cowboys"], ''MSNBC''/Associated Press. msnbc.com. Retrieved 6 April 2006.</ref> "straight-faced",<ref name="Miami Herald" /> and "pointedly poignant".<ref name="Miami Herald" /> Sublette, as expected, approves of Nelson's performance and its potential impact, saying, "It's supposed to be funny, that's what gets people's attention, but to get people to listen to it a second time [you] have to have something going on, and Willie beautifully brought out the tenderness there <U+2026> [It's] nice to have a funny song out there<U+2014>it is challenging people to laugh. Everybody is so angry now." Sublette speculated about the song's reception: "Willie's smart. We talked about recording it in the '90s but we needed some kind of context. It wouldn't make sense to just put this on some normal Willie album <U+2026> The movie provided the context. I don't know if the public is any more or less ready than they were but I think the media is more ready."<ref name="Miami Herald" />

The song was featured in a ''[[Boondocks]]'' comic strip on 27 and 28 February and mentioned until March 2006.<ref>"[http://www.gocomics.com/boondocks/2006/02/27 The Boondocks Comic Strip, February 27, 2006]", ''GoComics.com''. Universal Uclick. Retrieved 10 June 2012.</ref> According to Sublette, "the Monday and Tuesday strip consisted of my lyrics and dramatizing listeners' response to my lyrics. What a compliment!"<ref name="Miami Herald" />

The reception of Nelson's song may be compared  to that of [[Garth Brooks]]' 1992 [[Single (music)|single]] "[[We Shall Be Free]]". The song's line, "when we're free to love anyone we choose" caused some radio stations to refuse to play the song, contributing to its peak at number 12 on Billboard's country singles chart and marking the end of Brooks' string of top ten hits.<ref name="Tarradell" /> Nelson's song has been lumped together with contemporaneous LGBT friendly country releases: his and [[Emmylou Harris]]'s appearance on the ''Brokeback Mountain'' soundtrack and the [[Dolly Parton]]'s song "[[Transamerica (soundtrack)|Travelin' Thru]]" appearing on the ''Transamerica'' soundtrack, for which she received an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination.<ref name="PlanetOut"/>
