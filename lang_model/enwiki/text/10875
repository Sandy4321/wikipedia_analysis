==Special education==
In December 2009, the district administration reported that 213 pupils or 18.6% of the district's pupils received Special Education services.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://penndata.hbg.psu.edu/BSEReports/Public%20Reporting/2008_2009/PDF_Documents/Speced_Data_Report_SD622_495_Final.pdf |title=Shenandoah Valley School District Special Education Data Report LEA Performance on State Performance Plan (SPP) Targets School Year 2008-2009 |author=Pennsylvania Bureau of Special Education |date=January 31, 2011}}</ref>

The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team.  When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Supervisor of Special Education.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.svbluedevils.org/Sr_High_School_0S5P.php |title=Special Education Department - Annual Public Notice of Special Education Services |author=Shenandoah Valley School District |year=2011}}</ref> 

In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/education_budget/8699/proposed_special_education_funding_-/539261 |title=Pennsylvania Special Education Funding |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education}}</ref>

Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to honors and advanced placement courses, and dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student<U+2019>s building principal and requesting an evaluation.  All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist.

The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/BillInfo.cfm?syear=2007&sind=0&body=H&type=B&bn=1067 |title=Regular Session 2007-2008 House Bill 1067, Act 61 Section 6 page 8}}</ref> The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.center-school.org/bullyingprevention/about.php |title=Center for Safe Schools of Pennsylvania, Bullying Prevention advisory |accessdate=January 2011}}</ref>

The difference of the costs will go to upgrades, renovations and other work, such as replace the roof on the elementary school, replace an elevator, restructure inside to move facilities, such as the nurse's office, and improve security throughout the facilities.<rev>{{Cite web |url=http://newsitem.com/news/officials-public-discuss-additional-classrooms-for-shenandoah-valley-1.300546#axzz1Dk52c6g4 |title=Officials, public discuss additional classrooms for Shenandoah Valley |publisher=Republican Herald |date=October 2009}}</ref> There was significant taxpayer opposition to the project. Opponents urged the school board to put the project on the next election ballot. some opponents suggested the board consolidate with several local school districts. The board rejected that plan and took out debt that will require annual tax increases for many years.

The district is funded by a combination of: a local income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax regardless of the individual's wealth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.revenue.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/personal_income_tax/11409 |title=Personal Income Tax Information |author=Pennsylvania Department of Revenue |date=October 2010}}</ref>

===State basic education funding===
For 2010-11 the Shenandoah Valley School District received a 4.57% increase in state Basic Education Funding resulting in a $7,241,012 payment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/40153192/PA-Basic-Education-Funding-Printout2-2010-2011 |title=PA House Appropriations Committee Basic Education Funding-Printout2 2010-2011 |author=Pennsylvania house Appropriations Committee |August 2010}}</ref> The highest increase in BEF in Schuylkill County went to [[Minersville Area School District]] which received 9.96%. [[Kennett Consolidated School District]] in [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]] received the highest increase in the state at 23.65% increase in funding for the 2010-11 school year. The amount of increase each school district receives is determined by the Governor and the Secretary of Education through the allocation set in the state budget proposal made in February each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt?open=512&objID=4571&mode=2 |title=Pennsylvania Budget Proposal, |author=Office of Budget, |date=February 2010.}}</ref>

====Accountability Block Grants====
Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania<U+2019>s school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, All Day Kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11 the Shenandoah Valley School District applied for and received $200,288 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district used the funding to provide full day kindergarten for the seventh year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/education_budget/8699/pa_accountability_grants/604468 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Accountability Block Grant report 2010, Grantee list 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/23322599/ACCOUNTABILITY-BLOCK-GRANT-Awards |title=Accountability Block Grant Mid Year report |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education}}</ref>

====Classrooms for the Future grant====
The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Shenandoah Valley School District did not apply for funding in 2006-07. In 2007-08 it received $40,485. For the 2008-09, school year the district received $20,679 for a total funding of $61,164. Of the 501 public school districts in Pennsylvania, 447 of them received Classrooms for the Future grant awards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.auditorgen.state.pa.us/reports/performance/special/specff122208.pdf |title=Special Performance Audit Classrooms For the Future grants |author=Pennsylvania Auditor General |date=2008-12-22}}</ref>

===Federal Stimulus Grant===
The district received an extra $1,900,032 in [[ARRA]] - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low income students.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.recovery.pa.gov/ |title=Schuylkill County ARRA FUNDING Report |author=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania |accessdate=February 2011}}</ref> The funding is for the 2009-10 and 2010-11 school years.

====Race to the Top grant====
School district officials did  not apply for the [[Race to the Top]] federal grant which would have brought the district up to one million dollars of additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.education.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt?open=512&objID=7201&PageID=510952&mode=2&contentid=http://pubcontent.state.pa.us/publishedcontent/publish/global/news_releases/governor_s_office/news_releases/pennsylvania_s__race_to_the_top__fueled_by_effective_reforms__strong_local_support.html |title=Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education Press Release |date=January 2009}}</ref> Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate.<ref>Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support</ref> Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited  as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/index.html |title=Race to the Top Fund, |author=U.S. Department of Education |date=March 29, 2010}}</ref>

===Common Cents state initiative===
The Shenandoah Valley School Board did not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/common_cents/8781 |title=Common Cents program - Making Every Dollar Count |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |accessdate=February 1, 2011}}</ref> After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes.

===Real estate taxes===
The school board set property tax rates in 2010-2011 at 49.3000 mills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/40141929/Pennsylvania-Department-of-Education-Finances-Real-Estate-Tax-Rates-2010-11 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates 2010-11}}</ref> A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections (Local Tax Enabling Act), which are around 15% of revenues for school districts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/summaries_of_annual_financial_report_data/7673/afr_excel_data_files/509047 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education, |title=Act 511 Tax Report, 2004}}</ref> The school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, necessitating a state board equalization of the tax rates between the counties.

====Act 1 Adjusted index====
The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not authorized to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], for the previous 12-month period ending June 30.  For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.<ref>[http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/referendum_exceptions/7456 Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines.]</ref>

====Property tax relief====
In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Shenandoah Valley School District was $133 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 2,349 property owners applied for the tax relief. [[Schuylkill Haven Area School District]] received $195 which was the highest property tax relief allotted in Schuylkill County for 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wgal.com/download/2009/0501/19345089.pdf |title=Estimated Tax Relief Per Homestead and Farmstead May 1, 2009 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2009}}</ref> The tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property on the individual's tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.auditorgen.state.pa.us/department/press/wagnerpennsylvaniansmissingoutonprop.html |title=Special Report Pennsylvania Property Tax Relief, |author=Pennsylvania Auditor General Office, |date=2010-02-23}}</ref> Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the [[Chester-Upland School District]] in [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]] at $632 per homestead and farmstead in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452/property_tax_reduction_allocations/510335 |title=Tax Relief per Homestead 5-1-10.

Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650.  Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially more than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_rent_rebate/11410 |title=Property Tax/Rent Rebate Program |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education}}</ref>
