'''Hardcore punk''' is a subgenre of [[punk rock]] that originated in [[North America]] and the [[UK]] in the late 1970s. The new sound was generally thicker, heavier and faster than earlier punk rock.<ref>{{cite book

Hardcore spawned several fusion genres and subgenres, some of which had mainstream success, such as [[melodic hardcore]], [[metalcore]], [[post-hardcore]], [[sludge metal]] and [[thrash metal]].

==History==
In  America, the [[music genre]] that became known as hardcore punk originated in different areas in the early 1980s, with notable centers of activity in [[California]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[New York City]], [[Michigan]],  and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. 

The origin of the term ''hardcore punk'' is uncertain. The Vancouver-based band [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]] may have helped to popularize the term with the title of their 1981 album, ''[[Hardcore '81]]''.<ref>{{cite web | author= | year= 2003| title="Hardcore Punk music history" | work=Silver Dragon Records | url=http://www.silver-dragon-records.com/hardcore_punk.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author= | year= | title="D.O.A. To Rock Toronto International Film Festival" | work=PunkOiUK | url=http://www.punkoiuk.co.uk/news/details.asp?newID=1267 | accessdate = 2006-12-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author= | year= | title="D.O.A." | work=punknews.org | url=http://www.punknews.org/bands/doa | accessdate = 2006-12-22}}</ref>  Until about 1983, the term ''hardcore'' was used sparingly, and mainly as a descriptive term. (i.e., a band would be called a "hardcore band" and a concert would be a "hardcore show"). [[United States|American]] [[teenager]]s who were fans of hardcore punk simply considered themselves fans of ''punk'' <U+2013> although they were not necessarily interested in the original [[punk rock]] sound of late 1970s (e.g., [[Ramones]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[The Clash]], or [[The Damned]]). In many circles, ''hardcore'' was an in-group term, meaning ''music by people like us.'' 
Since most bands had little access to any means of production, hardcore lauded a [[DIY ethic|do-it-yourself (DIY)]] approach. In most cities the hardcore scene relied on inexpensively-made DIY [[recordings]] created on four-track recorders and sold at concerts or by mail. Concerts were promoted by photocopied [[zine]]s, community radio shows, and affixing posters to walls and telephone poles. Hardcore punk fans adopted a ''dressed-down'' style of [[T-shirt]]s, [[jeans]], and [[crewcut]]-style haircuts. While 1977-era punk had used DIY clothing as well, such as torn pants held together with safety pins, the dressed-down style of the 1980s hardcore scene contrasted with the more elaborate and provocative fashion styles of late 1970s punk rockers, which included make-up, elaborate hairdos and avant-garde clothing experiments.

During the same period, there was a parallel development in the [[United Kingdom]] of a British form of hardcore punk or [[street punk]].<ref>[http://www.uk82.com/ UK82.com]</ref> British hardcore bands such as [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]] and [[Chaos UK]] took the existing late 1970s punk sound and added the incessant, heavy drumbeats and distorted guitar sound of [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]] (NWOBHM) bands such as [[Mot<U+00F6>rhead]]. This contributed to the development of the [[thrash metal]] sound of the 1980s.

===Pioneers===
[[Michael Azerrad]]'s book ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]'' and Steven Blush' documentary film ''American Hardcore'' describe three bands -- [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Bad Brains]], and [[Minor Threat]] -- as the most important and influential in the genre. Azerrad calls Black Flag the genre<U+2019>s "godfathers"; credits Bad Brains, formed in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1977, with introducing "light speed [[tempo]]s" to hardcore; and describes [[Minor Threat]] as the "definitive" hardcore punk band. 

Black Flag, formed by [[guitarist]] and [[songwriter]] [[Greg Ginn]] in [[Los Angeles]] in 1976, had a major impact on the Los Angeles scene <U+2013> and later the wider [[North America]]n scene <U+2013> with their raw, confrontational sound and DIY approach. Tours in 1980 and 1981 brought Black Flag in contact with developing hardcore scenes in many parts of North America, and blazed trails followed by other touring bands.<ref>[http://www.punknews.org/bands/blackflag Black Flag]</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9105869/Black-Flag Britannica.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/black_flag/bio.jhtml VH1 - Black Flag]</ref>

[[Bad Brains]], formed in [[Washington, DC]] in 1977, incorporated elements of heavy metal and [[reggae]], and their early work often emphasized some of the fastest tempos in [[rock music]].<ref>[http://homepages.nyu.edu/~cch223/usa/badbrains_main.html Bad Brains]</ref> .

[[Minor Threat]], formed in Washington D.C. in 1980, played an aggressive, fast style directly influenced by Bad Brains. The band inspired the [[straight edge]] movement with their song, "Straight Edge".

===Other early notable bands===

According to Brendan Mullen, founder of the [[Los Angeles]] punk club [[The Masque]], the first U.S. tour of [[The Damned]] in 1977 found them favoring very fast tempos, causing a "sensation" among fans and musicians, and helping inspire the first wave of U.S. west coast hardcore punk.<ref>see Mullen's comments in the [[Don Letts]] directed documentary ''Punk: Attitude''.</ref>

[[San Francisco]]'s [[Dead Kennedys]] formed in 1978 and released their first single "[[California <U+00DC>ber Alles]]" in 1979. By the time they released the ''[[In God We Trust, Inc.]]'' EP in 1981, Dead Kennedys were playing very fast tempos. [[Circle Jerks]]<U+2019> first album, Group Sex (recorded in late 1979, released 1980) features several songs with very fast chord changes and tempos. [[Misfits (band)|The Misfits]] (of New Jersey) were a 1977-style punk band involved in New York<U+2019>s [[Max's Kansas City]] scene. Their [[horror film]] aesthetic was popular among early hardcore fans. In 1981, the Misfits integrated high-speed thrash songs into their set. [[H<U+00FC>sker D<U+00FC>]] was formed in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] in 1979 as a [[post-punk]]/[[New Wave (music)|New Wave]] band, but soon became a loud and fast hard punk band. H<U+00FC>sker D<U+00FC> released the 1982 live album ''[[Land Speed Record (album)|Land Speed Record]]'', which has been called a "breakneck force like no other... Not for the faint of heart."<ref>[http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:fbfexqw5ldae allmusic (((Everything Falls Apart and More > Overview)))<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By 1985, the band morphed into one of the seminal [[alternative rock]] bands.<ref>http://www.deadkennedys.com][http://www.deadkennedys.com/history.htm</ref> In 1982, [[Bad Religion]] released ''[[How Could Hell Be Any Worse?]]'', which is considered a benchmark hardcore album, and which secured them as one of the most enduring outfits of the early 1980s hardcore scene.
   
By 1981, many more hardcore punk bands began to perform and release recordings, including [[7 Seconds]] of [[Reno, Nevada]] who formed in 1979; [[M.I.A]] of [[Las Vegas, Nevada| Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]; [[Negative Approach]]<ref>{{cite news | first=Tony | last=Rettman | title=Michigan hardcore pioneers Violent Apathy reunite for shows | date=2008 | publisher = Swindle (issue 12) | url= http://swindlemagazine.com/issue12/detroit-hardcore/| accessdate = }}</ref> and [[Degenerates]]<ref>Nelson, Jason.[http://www.stereokiller.com/bands/Degenerates "Degenerates (Online Band Profile / Biography)"].

The [[Beastie Boys]], more widely known for their later [[hip hop music]], were one of the first recorded hardcore bands in New York City. Negative FX, perhaps the most popular hardcore band in Boston around early 1982, did not appear on record while they were together. They were largely unknown outside their own area until a posthumous album was released in 1984. In Honolulu, the skater surfer fueled community juxtaposed well in the tropical tourist city. Bands like Super Rad Ohana, The Sharx, and Devil Dog thrived from '81 -'87.<ref>David Carr: [http://www.comrademotopu.com/hawaiirelatedtop.htm Hawaii 70s-80s Punk Museum].

===Early media support and criticism===
An influential radio show in the [[Los Angeles]] area was ''Rodney on the ROQ'', which started airing on the commercial station [[KROQ]] in 1976. DJ [[Rodney Bingenheimer]] played many styles of music and helped popularize what was called ''Beach Punk'', a rowdy [[suburb]]an style played by mostly teenage bands in the [[Huntington Beach]] area and in [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]. Early radio support in [[New Jersey]] came from Pat Duncan, who hosted live punk and hardcore bands weekly on [[WFMU]] since 1979.<ref>{{cite web | author= | year= | title="Playlists and Archives for Pat Duncan" | work=WFMU | url=http://www.wfmu.org/playlists/PD | accessdate = 2006-12-22}}</ref> In [[New York City]], Tim Sommer hosted ''Noise The Show'' on [[WNYU]].<ref>{{cite web | author= | year= | title="Tim Sommer" | work=Beastiemania.com | url=http://www.beastiemania.com/whois/sommer_tim/ | accessdate = 2006-12-22}}</ref> In 1982 and 1983, [[MTV]] put the hardcore punk band Kraut on mild rotation.<ref>{{cite web | author= | year= | title="A short history of Kraut" | work=Liner Notes from Complete Studio Recordings 1982-1986

College radio was the main media outlet for hardcore punk in most of [[North America]]. The [[Berkeley, California]] [[Public broadcasting|public radio]] station [[KPFA]] featured the ''[[Maximum RocknRoll]]''  radio show with DJs [[Tim Yohannan]] and Jeff Bale, who played the younger [[Northern California]] bands. Several [[zine]]s, such as ''[[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]]'' and ''Maximum RocknRoll'', also helped spread the new punk style. A few college stations faced FCC action due to the broadcasting of indecent lyrics associated with hardcore songs.

Concerts in the early hardcore scene increasingly became sites of violent battles between police and concertgoers, especially in Los Angeles. Reputed violence at hardcore concerts was featured in episodes of the popular television shows ''[[CHiPs]]'' and ''[[Quincy, M.E.]]'', in which Los Angeles hardcore punks were depicted as being involved in murder and mayhem.<ref>[http://www.chips-tv.com/wiki/index.php?title=Battle_of_the_Bands Battle of the Bands - CHiPs Wiki<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Early history in Europe===
The [[Netherlands]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], and [[Germany]] have had notably active hardcore scenes. However, in the [[United Kingdom]], [[street punk]] (also known as UK hardcore) bands such as [[The Exploited]], [[Disorder (band)|Disorder]], [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]] and [[Chaos UK]] occupied the cultural space that American-style hardcore did elsewhere. These UK bands at times showed a musical similarity to American hardcore, often including quick tempos and chord changes, and they generally had similar political and social sensibilities. However, they represented a case of parallel evolution, having been musically inspired by [[Oi!]] bands such as [[Sham 69]], and the [[speed metal]] band [[Mot<U+00F6>rhead]].

Discharge played a huge role in influencing early Swedish hardcore bands, such as [[Anti Cimex]]. Many hardcore bands from that region still have a strong Discharge and Mot<U+00F6>rhead influence.

[[Anarcho-punk]] bands such as [[Crass]], [[Icons of Filth]], [[Flux Of Pink Indians]] and [[Rudimentary Peni]] shared an uncompromising political philosophy and an abrasive aesthetic with American hardcore.

Many American hardcore punks listened to British punk bands, but others upheld a strict regionalism, deriding the UK bands as [[Rock music|rock stars]] and their fans as inauthentic. American hardcore bands that visited the UK (such as [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and [[U.S. Chaos]] in 1981-1982) encountered ambivalent attitudes. European hardcore bands suffered no such prejudice in the U.S.; Italian bands [[Raw Power (band)|Raw Power]] and [[Negazione]], and the Dutch [[BGK]], enjoyed widespread popularity. 

In the more underground part of the UK punk scene, a new hardcore sound and scene developed, inspired by continental European, [[Scandinavia]]n, Japanese and American bands. It was started by bands like [[Asylum (band)|Asylum]] and [[Plasmid (band)|Plasmid]], and their sound <U+2013> only heard at concerts and on demo tapes and compilations in the mid 1980s <U+2013> evolved into metal bands such as [[Heresy (band)|Heresy]], [[Napalm Death]] and [[Extreme Noise Terror]]. 

There were many 1980s bands that could be described as sounding like something in between the styles of the dominating UK and US bands. While the bands that had the most significant influence were bands such as Discharge and Charged GBH, others, such as [[The Stupids]] (a UK band influenced by US hardcore) gained brief but widespread college-radio airplay in the US. 

Other notable bands from that era in Europe were Crise Total ([[Portugal]]), [[Wretched (punk band)|Wretched]], H.H.H., MG-15, Subterranean Kids, L'Odi Social, Ultimo Gobierno ([[Spain]]), [[Vorkriegsjugend]], [[Spermbirds]] ([[Germany]]), U.B.R. (Former [[Yugoslavia]]),  [[Heimat-Los]] ([[France]]), [[L<U+00E4>rm]], [[Funeral Oration (band)|Funeral Oration]] ([[Netherlands]]), [[Dezerter]] ([[Poland]]), [[Kaaos]],  [[Lama]], [[Riistetyt]], [[Terveet K<U+00E4>det]], ([[Finland]]), [[Headcleaners]], [[Homy Hogs]] and [[Mob 47]] ([[Sweden]]). 

Examples of European bands that continued to play the original style of hardcore in the 1990s include [[Voorhees (band)|Voorhees]], [[Totalit<U+00E4>r]], [[Disfear]] and [[Sin Dios]]. After the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]] in [[eastern Europe]], many hardcore bands were created or became more publicly known (after hiding in garages and being known only by small circles of underground fans).

===Late 1980s===
By the late 1980's the hardcore music sound was mainly based on the East Coast and New York City in particular. However, there were some notable West Coast bands such as Chain of Strength and Inside Out.

The important hardcore bands during the late 1980's were almost exclusively from New York including Youth of Today, Raw Deal, Sick of it All, Agnostic Front, Murphy's Law, Underdog, Sheer Terror, Breakdown, Leeway, Side by Side, Warzone, Gorilla Biscuits, Bold, Absolution, Token Entry and Judge. Slapshot was the premiere hardcore band from Boston.

===1990s===
{{Further|[[Metalcore]]}}
By the end of the 1980s, hardcore became more diverse, branching off into two sounds: one traditionally punk-based and the other evolving into something heavier, slower, and more intense, influenced by heavy metal, known as [[metalcore]]. The punk-focused sound retained much of the style and feel of the original hardcore punk bands, while the more metallic sound, sometimes labeled [[metallic hardcore]],<ref>{{cite web|title= EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH SHAI HULUD GUITARIST MATT FOX |url= http://www.metalsucks.net/?p=5504|accessdate= 2008-10-09|quote= "When we used to joke with the term, it was just a clever (or not so clever) way of describing a metallic hardcore, metal-influenced hardcore, or hardcore-influenced metal band." }}</ref><ref>J. Bennett, "Converge's ''Jane Doe'', ''Revolver'', June 2008</ref> tended to be heavier and often more technical. [[Sick of It All]]'s second studio album, ''Just Look Around'' (1991) is illustrative of this intense, heavy and slower style. [[Judge (band)|Judge]], [[Hogan's Heroes (band)| Hogans Heroes]] and [[Integrity (band)|Integrity]] were some of the earliest bands to feature an amalgamation of deep, hoarse vocals (though rarely as deep or guttural as [[death metal]]); downtuned guitars and thrashy drum rhythms inspired by earlier hardcore bands; and slow, [[staccato]] low-end musical breaks, known as ''breakdowns''. 

[[Thrash metal]] and [[melodic death metal]] elements are also common in [[melodic metalcore]].<ref name=amg>Allmusic Review, Atreyu, ''Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses'' [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:0jfpxql0ldae] Access date: June 24, 2008</ref><ref name=mi>''Metal Injection'', August 28, 2007 [http://metalinjection.net/reviews/cd-reviews-arch-enemy-black-earth-reissue] Access date: June 24, 2008</ref> Biohazard and Candiria emerged as two of the most popular, innovative and respected metalcore bands. Other important bands of the era, such as [[Inside Out (hardcore band)|Inside Out]] from California and [[Burn]] from New York, retained elements of classic hardcore along with more progressive rhythms, chord progressions and lyrics.

Ebullition Records, founded in 1990 by [[Kent McClard]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]], often released albums by bands that criticized the American political and economic system, paying less attention to personal issues. Anarchist ethics seeped their way into the work of many hardcore punk bands, most notably [[Aus-Rotten]], who were also popular in the [[crust punk]] genre. On the east coast of the United States, bands such as [[Rorschach (band)|Rorschach]] and [[Born Against]] also played a similar [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] form of metallic hardcore. [[Refused]] gained international recognition after touring for several years. They released their final album ''[[The Shape of Punk to Come]]'' and later broke up during a US tour.

Hardcore saw a major rebirth in the mid 1990s with bands starting up all over the East Coast. Some of the more popular bands who established themselves during this era included Madball, Hatebreed, 25 Ta Life, Crown of Thornz, Skarhead, Shutdown, Indecision, Snapcase, Earth Crisis, Vision of Disorder, Bulldoze, One4One, Fury of Five, Sum of All Fears, Krutch, Mushmouth, Torn Apart, Converge, Morning Again, One King Down, Blood for Blood, All Out War, Merauder, Irate, Farenheight 451, E Town Concrete and Ten Yard Fight. Two bands from the West Coast who made a large impact were Strife and Ignite.

==Hardcore and politics==
{{POV|date=January 2009}}
[[File:Punks burning a flag.jpg|thumb|right|Punks burning a flag]]
While the aforementioned "godfathers" of the hardcore genre<U+2014>Bad Brains, Black Flag, Minor Threat<U+2014>usually did not deal with overt political themes, many bands that followed in their wake took strong [[left-wing]] political stances against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] US President [[Ronald Reagan]], who served in office from 1981 to 1989. Reagan's policies, including [[Reaganomics|"Reaganomics"]]  and [[social conservatism|social]] [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]], were common subjects for these bands.<ref>[http://nestorindetroit.com/Music%20Rants/reagan.htm Reagan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>www.house.gov/jec/growth/taxpol/taxpol.htm</ref> [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Reagan Youth]] and [[MDC (band)|MDC]] promoted [[anarchist]] views. However, a minority of hardcore bands were relatively conservative, such as [[The FU's]], [[The Undead]] and [[Antiseen]].

== Legacy and Influence on other genres ==
The [[San Francisco]]-based [[thrash metal]] bands [[Metallica]] and [[Slayer]] incorporated the compositional structure and technical proficiency of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] with the speed and aggression of hardcore. The new [[fusion genre]] became known as [[thrash metal]]. Other early bands in this genre include [[Megadeth]], [[Sepultura]] and [[Anthrax (band)|Anthrax]]. [[Slayer]] are also known for their hardcore punk roots, and have released an album of hardcore [[cover version]]s called ''[[Undisputed Attitude]]''. Sepultura's members were in hardcore bands in Brazil and have recorded with hardcore musicians such as Agnostic Front.

In 1985, New York's [[Stormtroopers of Death]], an Anthrax side project, released the album ''[[Speak English or Die]]''. Although it bore similarities to thrash metal <U+2013> with a bass-heavy guitar, fast tempos and quick chord changes <U+2013> the album was distinguished from thrash metal by its lack of guitar solos and heavy use of crunchy chord breakdowns (a [[New York hardcore]] technique) known as [[Moshing|mosh]] parts. Other bands, such as [[Suicidal Tendencies]] and [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles]] (DRI]), switched from hardcore to a similar metallic style, which came to be known as [[crossover thrash]].

Some hardcore bands began experimenting with other styles as their careers progressed in the 1980s, becoming known as [[alternative rock]].<ref>Reynolds, Simon (2005). ''Rip It Up and Start Again: Post Punk 1978<U+2013>1984'' (London and New York: Faber and Faber). ISBN 0-571-21569-6, pp. 460-467</ref> Bands such as [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]], [[Meat Puppets]], [[H<U+00FC>sker D<U+00FC>]], and [[The Replacements]] drew from hardcore but broke away from its loud and fast formula. Critic Joe S. Harrington suggested that the latter two "paraded as Hardcore until it was deemed permissible to do otherwise".<ref>Harrington, Joe S. (2002). ''Sonic Cool: The Life & Death of Rock 'n' Roll'' (Milwaukee, Wisc.: Hal Leonard). ISBN 0-634-02861-8, p. 388</ref> 

In the mid-1980s, [[Washington]] State bands such as [[Melvins]] and [[Green River (band)|Green River]] developed a sludgy, "aggressive sound that melded the slower tempos of heavy metal with the intensity of hardcore", creating what became known as [[grunge music]].<ref>[[Michael Azerrad|Azerrad, Michael]] (2001). ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]'' (New York: Little, Brown). ISBN 0-316-78753-1, p. 419</ref> The early grunge sound was largely influenced by [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] (especially their ''[[My War]]'' album). The popularity of grunge resulted in renewed interest in American hardcore in the 1990s.

Melvins, aside from their influence on grunge, helped create what would be known as [[sludge metal]], which is also a combination between Black Sabbath-style music and hardcore punk.<ref name="AMG-Eyehategod">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusicguide.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:fzfixqu5ldse~T1|

The later 1980s and early 1990s saw the development of [[post-hardcore]], which took the hardcore style in a more artistic and complex direction, much as the bands of the [[post-punk]] era did for classic punk rock. [[Washington DC]], in particular the community surrounding [[Dischord Records]], became a hotbed for post-hardcore, producing bands such as [[Hoover (band)|Hoover]], [[Nation of Ulysses]], [[Jawbox]] and [[Fugazi]], who helped define the scene and included Dischord founder and former Minor Threat frontman [[Ian MacKaye]]. Other notable post-hardcore bands from the United States include Chicago's [[Big Black]], New York's [[Quicksand (band)|Quicksand]] and [[Orange 9mm]], Seattle's [[Pretty Girls Make Graves]], Atlanta's [[Light Pupil Dilate]] and El Paso, Texas' [[At The Drive-In]].  

Post-hardcore included and influenced other styles, such as [[emo]] and [[math rock]]. Early emo bands were influenced by hardcore bands like [[Rites of Spring]], [[Minor Threat]], and Black Flag. Emo bands are heavily influenced by hardcore punk's powerful lyrics, song structure and emotion. [[Sunny Day Real Estate]] are sometimes called the "first true emo band."<ref>Greenwald, Andy. "Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo." pages 9-33 and 37-39.</ref>

The hardcore punk scene had an influence that spread beyond music. The [[straight edge]] philosophy of no smoking, drinking or doing drugs was rooted in a faction of hardcore particularly popular on the east coast of the United States. Hare Krishna bands like 108 and Shelter typified this movement, taking it even a step further. Hardcore also put a great emphasis on the [[DIY punk ethic]], which inspired other types of bands to make their own records, flyers and other items, and to book their own tours through an informal network of like-minded people.

==Hardcore dancing==
{{main|Mosh|Hardcore dancing}}
The early 1980s hardcore punk scene developed [[Mosh|slam dancing]] and [[stage diving]]. In the second half of the 1980s, the [[thrash metal]] scene adopted this form of dancing, with bands such as [[Anthrax (band)|Anthrax]] popularizing the term ''mosh'' with the [[Heavy metal music|metal]] scene.<ref>(2001) "Moshpit", ISBN 0711987440, 9780711987449, p.38: Alternatively the term may have been coined by Anthrax or SOD (Storm troopers Of Death), an Anthrax affiliated project whose 'Milano Mosh' was an influental track"</ref> The term ''hardcore dancing'' now describes a type of dancing that has become staple of hardcore concerts.
