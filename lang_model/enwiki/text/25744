"'''Rather Die Young'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]] for her fourth studio album, ''[[4 (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles album)|4]]'' (2011). Composed by Knowles, [[Jeff Bhasker]], [[Luke Steele (musician)|Luke Steele]], the song's development was motivated by the fact that Knowles wanted a song that would help people through both their painful and happy moments. "Rather Die Young" is an [[contemporary R&B|R&B]]-[[soul music|soul]] [[Ballad (music)|power ballad]] that is instrumentally complete with [[synthesizer]]s, a [[piano]], a [[Strum|strummy]] [[guitar]], and heavy [[drum]]s, which were inspired by the work of the American band [[Earth, Wind & Fire]]. Lyrically, the song talks about the inability to fight what the heart wants. The female protagonist sings to an indifferent [[Romantic interest|love interest]], whom she likens to American actor [[James Dean]] and tells him that she prefers to die rather than live without him.

"Rather Die Young" was generally well received by contemporary [[music critics]] who described it as a dark, yet enchanting ballad. They highlighted Knowles' vocal power and the song's melody. Critics also noted that the ballad was heavily influenced by the 1980s R&B and soul music, adding that it has a [[Philadelphia soul]] vibe. However, some of them commented that it was barely distinguishable among the other songs on ''4'', criticizing its chorus which, according to them, forms the major part of the song. Following the release of ''4'', "Rather Die Young" charted at number 37 on the [[Gaon Chart|South Korea Gaon International Singles Chart]], based on downloads alone. The song was part of Knowles' [[set list]] for her ''[[4 Intimate Nights with Beyonc<U+00E9>]]'' [[revue]], held at [[Roseland Ballroom]], in New York City.

==Critical reception==
Joanne Dorken of [[MTV UK]] wrote that "Rather Die Young" is a "dark, yet enchanting... mesmerising" ballad, noting that as Knowles sings, she give listeners a sense of mystery.<ref name="MTVUK" /> She also commended her "stunning vocals".<ref name="MTVUK" /> Likewise, Chad Grischow of the website [[IGN]] wrote that the song gives Knowles' vocals room to shine with "some beautifully soft verses and [a] belted hook".<ref name="ign" /> Alexis Petridis of ''The Guardian'' called "Rather Die Young" a fantastic and dramatic song.<ref name="Petridis" /> Similarly, ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s Matthew Perpetua wrote, "There's a great melodramatic kick to this song, which comes across like a quiet storm slow jam spiced up with modern drum programming. 'I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you' is an unusually self-pitying lyric for Beyonc<U+00E9>, but she sells it well regardless."<ref name="rollingstone1">{{cite web|first=Matthew|last=Perpetua |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beyonces-4-a-track-by-track-breakdown-20110608 |title=Beyonce's '4': A Track-by-Track Breakdown &#124; Rolling Stone Music |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]] |date=June 8, 2011 |accessdate=December 7, 2011}}</ref> Conrad Tao of Sputnikmusic showed high favoritism for the song, writing:

<blockquote>
[Knowles'] utterance of 'you're my James Dean / you make me feel like I'm seventeen' on 'Rather Die Young' is made tolerable by her honeyed vocal slides. Certainly, the 'bad boy' Beyonc<U+00E9> is in love with is more a physical representation of countless painfully banal fantasies about guys who 'drive too fast' and 'smoke too much' than an actual person, but at least it feels tangible. For once, the pop song trying to make a connection with its listener doesn't feel like a total fraud. Forget [[Lady Gaga]]'s song about her relationship with her father or [[Britney Spears]]' lullaby to her babies <U+2013> here, I'm convinced, if only for a moment, that Beyonc<U+00E9> really would rather die young than to live her life without her lover, that she cares, even if you don't. This doesn't fully explain why 4 is as enjoyable as it is, but it does convey just how convincing Beyonc<U+00E9> can be when given the right tools <U+2013> and it turns out that those tools consist of not much more than Beyonc<U+00E9>'s voice itself.<ref name="spence" />

A mixed review came from Adam Markovitz of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', who compared Knowles' work on "Rather Die Young" to that of past idols such as [[Luther Vandross]] and [[Diana Ross]], but felt the tone overshadowed her style, stating that "she gets lost in her idols' polyester-swathed shadows".<ref>{{cite web |first=Adam |last=Markovitz |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20504524,00.html |title=4 review <U+2013> Beyonc<U+00E9> Review |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time Inc]] |date=July 10, 2011 |accessdate=December 8, 2011}}</ref> Matthew Horton of [[BBC Online]] wrote that the ballad is less successful than the other songs on ''4'' because of its "overdone glitz".<ref>{{cite web |last=Horton |first=Matthew |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/zw4z |title=BBC <U+2013> Music <U+2013> Review of Beyonc<U+00E9> <U+2013> 4 |publisher=[[BBC Online]].
