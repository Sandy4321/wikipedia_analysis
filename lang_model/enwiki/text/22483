'''SMS ''Dresden''''' ("His Majesty's Ship ''Dresden''"){{efn|name=SMS|}} was the [[lead ship]] of [[Dresden class cruiser|her class]], built for the [[Imperial German Navy]] (''Kaiserliche Marine''). She was laid down at the [[Blohm & Voss]] shipyard in [[Hamburg]] in 1906, was launched in October 1907, and completed in November 1908. She had one sister ship, {{SMS|Emden|1908|2}}. Like the preceding [[K<U+00F6>nigsberg-class cruiser (1905)|''K<U+00F6>nigsberg''-class cruisers]], ''Dresden'' was armed with ten {{convert|10.5|cm|abbr=on}} guns and two [[torpedo tube]]s.

''Dresden'' spent most of her career overseas. After her commissioning, she visited the United States in 1909 during the [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]]. In late 1913, she was stationed off the Mexican coast to protect German nationals during the [[Mexican Revolution]]; at the end of the conflict the following year, she carried the former dictator [[Victoriano Huerta]] to [[Jamaica]], where the British had granted him asylum. She was due to return to Germany in July 1914, but the outbreak of [[World War I]] prevented this from occurring. At the onset of hostilities, ''Dresden'' operated as a commerce raider in South American waters in the Atlantic, before moving to the Pacific Ocean in September and thereafter joining [[Maximilian von Spee]]'s [[German East Asia Squadron|East Asia Squadron]]. 

''Dresden'' saw action in the [[Battle of Coronel]] in November, where she engaged the British cruiser {{HMS|Glasgow|1909|6}}, and at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]] in December, where she was the only German warship to escape destruction. She eluded her British pursuers for several more months, until she put into [[Robinson Crusoe Island|M<U+00E1>s a Tierra]] in March 1915. Her engines were worn out and she had almost no coal left for her boilers; the ship's captain contacted the local Chilean authorities to have ''Dresden'' interned. There, she was trapped by British cruisers, including her old opponent ''Glasgow''; the British violated Chilean neutrality and opened fire on the ship. The Germans scuttled ''Dresden'' and the majority of the crew escaped to be interned in Chile for the duration of the war. The wreck remains in the harbor, but several artifacts, including her bell and compass, have been returned to Germany.

{{main|Dresden class cruiser}}
''Dresden'' was {{convert|118.3|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|13.5|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.53|m|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|4268|t|abbr=on}} at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]]s, designed to give {{convert|15000|shp|lk=in}} for a top speed of {{convert|24|kn|lk=in}}. The engines were powered by twelve coal-fired Marine-type [[water-tube boiler]]s. ''Dresden'' carried up to {{convert|860|t|LT}} of coal, which gave her a range of {{convert|3600|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|14|kn}}. She had a crew of 18 officers and 343 enlisted men.<ref name=G105>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 105</ref>

The ship was armed with ten [[10.5 cm SK L/40 naval gun|10.5&nbsp;cm SK L/40 guns]] in single mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the [[forecastle]], six were located amidships, three on either side, and two were placed side by side aft. The guns could engage targets out to {{convert|12200|m|abbr=on}}. They were supplied with 1,500 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. She was also equipped with two {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s with four [[torpedo]]es, mounted on the deck. She was also fitted to carry fifty [[naval mine]]s. The ship was protected by an armored deck that was up to {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} thick. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides, and the guns were protected by {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} thick shields.<ref name=G105/>

==Service history==
[[File:SMS Dresden 1909 LOC det 4a16116.jpg|thumb|''Dresden'' visiting [[New York City]] in October 1909]]

''Dresden'' was ordered under the contract name ''[[Ersatz]]'' {{SMS|Comet||2}}{{efn|name=provisional names}} and was laid down at the [[Blohm & Voss]] shipyard in [[Hamburg]] in 1906 and launched on 5 October 1907, after which [[fitting-out]] work commenced. She was commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] on 14 November 1908.<ref name=G1056>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 105<U+2013>106</ref> Following her commissioning, ''Dresden'' was deployed to overseas stations.<ref name=G106>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 106</ref> She made her first trip overseas in September&ndash;October 1909 to participate in the [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]] in New York. There, she represented Germany, along with the [[protected cruiser]]s {{SMS|Hertha||2}} and {{SMS|Victoria Louise||2}} and the light cruiser {{SMS|Bremen||2}}.<ref>Levine & Panetta, p. 51</ref> She collided with the cruiser {{SMS|K<U+00F6>nigsberg|1905|2}} in German waters on 16 February 1910. The collision caused significant damage to ''Dresden'', though no one on either vessel was injured. She made it back to [[Kiel]], where repairs were effected.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cruisers in Collision|author= |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9504E1DE1430E233A25754C1A9649C946196D6CF |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=17 February 1910 |accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> On 6 April 1913, she and the cruiser {{SMS|Strassburg||2}} were sent to the [[Adriatic Sea]].<ref>{{cite news |title=German Cruisers for the Adriatic|author= |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9B04E7DC1F3AE633A25754C0A9629C946296D6CF |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=7 April 1913 |accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> On 15 April 1914, ''Dresden'' steamed to [[Tampico]] on Mexico's Caribbean coast.<ref>{{cite news |title=German Cruiser Ordered to Tampico|author= |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E03E1D9163AE633A25755C1A9629C946596D6CF |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=16 April 1914 |accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref>

In late 1913, during the [[Mexican Revolution]], the United States sent a squadron to operate off the Mexican coast, ready to intervene to protect American nationals. ''Dresden'' and several other foreign warships joined the American squadron for the same purpose.<ref>Lenz, p. 183</ref> In April 1914, the German-flagged merchant ship {{SS|Ypiranga}} arrived in Mexico, carrying a load of small arms for the regime of Mexican dictator [[Victoriano Huerta]]. The United States had put an arms embargo into effect in an attempt to reduce the violence of the civil war. The US Navy intercepted ''Ypiranga'' in the so-called "[[Ypiranga incident]]" on 21 April. Shortly thereafter, ''Dresden'' arrived and confiscated the merchantman and pressed her into naval service to transport German refugees out of Mexico. Despite the American embargo, the Germans nevertheless delivered the weapons and ammunition to the Mexican government on 28 May.<ref>Lenz, pp. 195&ndash;196</ref>

On 20 July, when the Huerta regime was toppled, ''Dresden'' carried Huerta and his family to [[Jamaica]], where Britain had granted them asylum. By this time, the ship was in need of a refit in Germany, and met with her replacement, {{SMS|Karlsruhe}}, on 26 July. But the outbreak of war in Europe shortly thereafter prevented ''Dresden'' from returning to Germany.<ref>Delgado, pp. 169&ndash;170</ref>

===World War I===
After meeting with ''Karlsruhe'', ''Dresden'' was preparing to return to Germany when the [[First World War]] broke out in August 1914. With the onset of hostilities, the ''[[Admiralstab]]'' (Admiralty Staff) ordered ''Dresden'' to operate as a commerce raider off South America, particularly in the area of the [[R<U+00ED>o de la Plata|River Plate]].<ref name=H7980>Halpern, pp. 79&ndash;80</ref> On 6 August, ''Dresden'' encountered the British merchant ship {{SS|Drumcliffe}}, whose captain professed to know nothing of Britain's entry into the war. ''[[Kapit<U+00E4>n zur See]]'' (Captain at Sea) Fritz Emil von L<U+00FC>decke, ''Dresden''{{'}}s commander, allowed ''Drumcliffe'' to proceed unmolested, in accordance with the rules set forth in the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention of 1907]]. ''Dresden'' thereafter rendezvoused with the German [[collier (ship type)|collier]] {{SS|Corrientes}}. On 14 August, the cruiser caught the British steamer {{SS|Hyades}}; L<U+00FC>decke took off the ship's crew and then sank the merchantman.<ref>Mueller, p. 11</ref> ''Dresden'' captured the British collier {{SS|Holmwood}} on 24 August and sank her after evacuating her crew.<ref name=M12>Mueller, p. 12</ref>

[[File:SMS Dresden German Cruiser LOC 04281.jpg|thumb|left|''Dresden'', {{SMS|Victoria Louise||2}}, and {{SMS|Hertha||2}} during the [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]] in 1909]]
On 5 September, ''Dresden'' put into [[Hoste Island]] for engine maintenance.<ref name=M12/> By 8 September, the ''Admiralstab'' ordered ''Dresden'' to rendezvous with the light cruiser {{SMS|Leipzig||2}}, which was operating on the Pacific coast of South America.<ref name=H7980/> On 16 September, the repairs to ''Dresden''{{'}}s engines were completed, and the ship departed Hoste Island to meet with ''Leipzig''. While en route, ''Dresden'' encountered the French steamer {{SS|Ortega}}, though L<U+00FC>decke refrained from attacking the transport ship, since she had fled into neutral waters.<ref name=M12/> ''Dresden'' saw no further success against British shipping, and on 12 October, she joined ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' (Vice Admiral) [[Maximilian von Spee]]'s [[German East Asia Squadron|East Asia Squadron]], which had crossed the Pacific and was coaling at [[Easter Island]]. Thereafter, ''Dresden'' caught a pair of British merchantmen, bringing her total to four ships and a total of {{convert|12927|LT}}.<ref>Halpern, p. 80</ref>

On 18 October, ''Dresden'' and the East Asia Squadron, which was centered on the [[armored cruiser]]s {{SMS|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{SMS|Gneisenau||2}}, departed Easter Island, bound for the South American coast. They arrived at [[Alejandro Selkirk Island|M<U+00E1>s a Fuera]] island on 26 October. The following evening, the German cruisers escorted the [[auxiliary cruiser]] {{SS|Prinz Eitel Friedrich|1904|6}} and the merchant ships {{SS|Yorck}} and {{SS|G<U+00F6>ttingen}} to Chile. The flotilla arrived off [[Valparaiso]] on 30 October, and the following evening, von Spee received intelligence that a British cruiser was at the Chilean port of [[Coronel, Chile|Coronel]]. Von Spee decided that his squadron should ambush the cruiser<U+2014>{{HMS|Glasgow|1909|6}}<U+2014>when it was forced to leave port due to Chile's neutral status, which required belligerent warships to leave after twenty-four hours.<ref>Staff, p. 30</ref> What von Spee did not know was that ''Glasgow'' was in the company of [[Rear Admiral]] [[Christopher Craddock]]'s [[4th Cruiser Squadron]], which also included the armored cruisers {{HMS|Monmouth|1901|2}} and {{HMS|Good Hope|1901|2}} and the auxiliary cruiser {{HMS|Otranto||2}}.<ref>Staff, pp. 30<U+2013>31</ref>

====Battle of Coronel====
[[File:Battle of Coronel map.svg|thumb|Map showing the movements of the German and British warships]]
{{main|Battle of Coronel}}
Early on the morning of 1 November, von Spee took his squadron out of Valparaiso, steaming at {{convert|14|kn}} south toward Coronel.<ref>Staff, p. 31</ref> At around 16:00, ''Leipzig'' spotted the first smoke column from the leading British cruiser. By 16:25, the other two ships had been spotted. The two squadrons slowly closed the distance, until the Germans opened fire at 18:34, at a range of {{convert|10400|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Staff, pp. 32<U+2013>33</ref> The German ships engaged their opposite numbers, with ''Dresden'' firing on ''Otranto''. After ''Dresden''{{'}}s third salvo, ''Otranto'' turned away after a hit that caused a fire was observed. Following ''Otranto''{{'}}s departure, ''Dresden'' shifted her fire to ''Glasgow'', which was also targeted by ''Leipzig''. The two German cruisers hit their British opponent five times.<ref>Staff, pp. 34<U+2013>35</ref>

At around 19:30, von Spee ordered ''Dresden'' and ''Leipzig'' to launch a torpedo attack against the damaged British armored cruisers. ''Dresden'' increased speed to position herself off the British bows, and briefly spotted ''Glasgow'' as she was withdrawing, but the British cruiser quickly disappeared in the haze and gathering darkness. Shortly thereafter, ''Dresden'' encountered ''Leipzig''; both ships initially thought the other was hostile. ''Dresden''{{'}}s crew was in the process of loading a torpedo when the two ships confirmed each other's identity.<ref>Staff, pp. 36<U+2013>37</ref> By 22:00, ''Dresden'' and the other two light cruisers were deployed in a line to search for the British cruisers, though they found nothing.<ref>Staff, p. 38</ref> ''Dresden'' had emerged from the battle completely unscathed.<ref>Mueller, p. 14</ref>

On 3 November, von Spee took ''Scharnhorst'', ''Gneisenau'', and ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' back to Valparaiso for provisioning and to consult with the ''Admiralstab''. Neutrality laws permitted only three belligerent warships in a port at a given time. ''Dresden'' and ''Leipzig'' meanwhile remained with the squadron's colliers in M<U+00E1>s a Fuera. Von Spee returned to M<U+00E1>s a Fuera on 6 November, and thereafter detached ''Dresden'' and ''Leipzig'' for a visit to Valparaiso, where they also restocked their supplies. The two cruisers arrived on 12 November, left the following day, and rendezvoused with the rest of the squadron at sea on 18 November. Three days later, the squadron anchored in [[St. Quentin Bay]] in the [[Gulf of Penas]], where they coaled.<ref>Staff, pp. 58<U+2013>59</ref>

Meanwhile, the Royal Navy had deployed a pair of [[battlecruiser]]s, {{HMS|Invincible|1907|2}} and {{HMS|Inflexible|1908|2}}, to hunt down the German squadron. The British ships were commanded by Vice Admiral [[Doveton Sturdee]]. They left Britain on 11 November, and arrived in the [[Falkland Islands]] nearly a month later, on 7 December. There, they joined the armored cruisers {{HMS|Cornwall|1902|2}}, {{HMS|Kent|1901|2}}, and {{HMS|Carnarvon|1903|2}}, and the light cruisers ''Glasgow'' and {{HMS|Bristol|1910|2}}.<ref>Staff, pp. 59<U+2013>60</ref>

On 26 November, the German East Asia Squadron left St. Quentin Bay, bound for the Atlantic. On 2 December, they caught the Canadian sailing ship ''Drummuir'', which was carrying some {{convert|2750|MT|sp=us}} of high-grade Cardiff coal. The following morning, the Germans anchored off [[Picton Island]], where they unloaded the coal from ''Drummuir'' into their own auxiliaries.<ref>Staff, p. 61</ref> On the morning of 6 December, von Spee held a council aboard ''Scharnhorst'' to discuss their next moves. He suggested an attack on the Falklands to destroy the British wireless station and coal stocks there. L<U+00FC>decke and the captains of ''Leipzig'' and ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' all opposed the plan, and were in favor of bypassing the Falklands and instead proceeding to the [[La Plata]] area to continue to raid British shipping. Regardless, von Spee and those who favored the attack on the Falklands won the argument.<ref>Staff, p. 62</ref>

====Battle of the Falkland Islands====
[[File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-61-30, Kleiner Kreuzer "SMS Dresden I".jpg|thumb|upright|''Dresden'' at anchor, probably before the war]]
{{main|Battle of the Falkland Islands}}
On the afternoon of 6 December, the German ships departed Picton Island, bound for the Falklands. On 7 December, they rounded the [[Tierra del Fuego]] and turned north into the Atlantic. They arrived off the Falklands at around 02:00; three hours later, von Spee detached ''Gneisenau'' and ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' to send a landing party ashore. By 08:30, the ships were approaching [[Port Stanley]], when they noticed thick columns of smoke rising from the harbor. After closing to the harbor entrance, they quickly realized they were confronted by a much more powerful squadron, which was just getting up steam. Von Spee immediately broke off the operation and turned east to flee before the British ships could catch his squadron. By 10:45, ''Gneisenau'' and ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' had rejoined the fleet, and the German auxiliaries were detached to seek shelter in the maze of islands off [[Cape Horn]].<ref>Staff, pp. 62<U+2013>64</ref>

The British ships set off in pursuit, and by 12:50, Sturdee's two battlecruisers had overhauled the Germans. A minute later, he gave the order to open fire at the trailing German ship, ''Leipzig''. Von Spee ordered the three small cruisers to try to escape to the south, while he turned back with ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' in an attempt to hold off the British squadron. Nevertheless, Sturdee had foreseen this possibility, and so had ordered his armored and light cruisers to pursue the German light cruisers.<ref>Staff, p. 65</ref> The battlecruisers quickly overwhelmed von Spee's armored cruisers, and destroyed them with very heavy loss of life.<ref>Staff, pp. 68<U+2013>72</ref>

Meanwhile, ''Dresden'', with her turbine engines, was able to outpace her pursuers, and was the only German warship to escape destruction that day. L<U+00FC>decke decided to take his ship into the islands off South America to keep a steady supply of coal available.<ref>Staff, p. 73</ref> On 9 December, she passed back around Cape Horn to return to the Pacific.<ref name=S80/> That day, she anchored in [[Sholl Bay]], with only {{convert|160|MT|abbr=on|sp=us}} of coal aboard. [[Lieutenant (navy)|''Oberleutnant zur See'']] (Lieutenant at Sea) [[Wilhelm Canaris]] convinced the Chilean naval representative for the region to permit ''Dresden'' to remain in the area for an extra twenty-four hours so enough coal could be taken aboard so she could reach [[Punta Arenas]].<ref>Mueller, pp. 15&ndash;16</ref> She arrived at there on 12 December, where she received {{convert|750|MT|abbr=on|sp=us}} of coal from a German steamer.<ref name=S80/> She took on another {{convert|1600|MT|abbr=on|sp=us}} of coal on 19 January.<ref>Mueller, p. 16</ref> On 14 February, ''Dresden'' left the islands off the South American coast for the South Pacific. On 27 February, the cruiser captured the British [[barque]] ''Conway Castle'' south of the island of [[Robinson Crusoe Island|M<U+00E1>s a Tierra]].<ref name=S80>Staff, p. 80</ref> 

On 8 March, ''Dresden'' was drifting in dense fog when lookouts spotted ''Kent'', which also had her engines off, about {{convert|15|nmi}} away. Both ships immediately got steam up in their boilers, but ''Dresden'' eventually escaped after a five-hour chase. The strenuous effort depleted her coal stocks and overtaxed her engines. L<U+00FC>decke decided that his ship was no longer operational, and determined to have his ship interned to preserve it. The following morning, she put into M<U+00E1>s a Fuera, dropping anchor in Cumberland Bay. Upon the ship's arrival, L<U+00FC>decke informed the local Chilean official of his intent to be interned.<ref>Mueller, pp. 16&ndash;17</ref>

====Battle of M<U+00E1>s a Tierra====
[[Image:SMS Dresden before scuttling.jpg|thumb|''Dresden'', flying a white flag, moments prior to her scuttling]]
{{Main|Battle of M<U+00E1>s a Tierra}}

On the morning of 14 March, ''Kent'' and ''Glasgow'' approached Cumberland Bay; their appearance was relayed back to ''Dresden'' by one of her [[Pinnace (ship's boat)|pinnaces]], which had been sent to patrol the entrance to the bay. ''Dresden'' was unable to maneuver, owing to her fuel shortage, and so L<U+00FC>decke signaled that his ship was no longer a combatant. The British disregarded this message, as well as the Chilean vessel that approached them as they entered the bay. ''Glasgow'' opened fire, in violation of Chile's neutrality; in fact, Britain had already informed Chile that British warships would disregard international law if they located ''Dresden'' in Chilean territorial waters.<ref name=M17>Mueller, p. 17</ref> Shortly thereafter, ''Kent'' joined in the bombardment as well. The German gunners fired off three shots in response, but the guns were quickly knocked out by British gunfire.<ref>Delgado, p. 168</ref>

L<U+00FC>decke sent the signal "Am sending negotiator" to the British warships, and dispatched Canaris in a pinnace; ''Glasgow'' nevertheless continued to bombard the defenseless cruiser. In another attempt to stop the attack, L<U+00FC>decke raised the [[White_flag#Flag_of_temporary_truce_in_order_to_parley_.28negotiate.29|white flag]], which finally prompted ''Glasgow'' to cease fire. Canaris came aboard to speak with Captain [[John Luce (Royal Navy officer)|John Luce]]; the former strongly protested the latter's violation of Chile's neutrality. Luce simply replied that he had his orders, and demanded an unconditional surrender. Canaris explained that ''Dresden'' had already been interned by Chile, and thereafter returned to his ship, which had in the meantime been prepared for scuttling.<ref name=M17/>

At 10:45, the scuttling charge detonated in the bow and exploded the forward ammunition magazines. The bow was badly mangled; in about half an hour, the ship had taken on enough water to sink. As it struck the sea floor, the bow was torn from the rest of the ship, which rolled over to starboard. As the rest of the hull settled below the waves, a second scuttling charge exploded in the ship's engine rooms.<ref>Delgado, pp. 168&ndash;169</ref>

{{Coord|33|36|6|S|78|49|30|W|display=title}}

===Aftermath===
[[File:Schiffsglockesmsdd.jpg|thumb|right|''Dresden''{{'}}s bell, recovered from wreck.]]

Most of the ship's crew managed to escape; only eight men were killed in the attack, with another twenty-nine wounded.<ref>Staff, p. 81</ref> The destruction of his ship had left L<U+00FC>decke in shock, and so Canaris took responsibility for the fate of the ship's crew. They remained on the island for five days until two Chilean warships brought a German passenger ship to take the men to [[Quiriquina Island]], where they would be interned for the duration of the war. On 5 August 1915, Canaris escaped from the internment camp, and eventually reached Germany two months later, on 5 October.<ref>Mueller, pp. 19&ndash;20</ref>

The wreck lies at a depth of {{convert|70|m|sp=us}}.<ref name=wrecksite/> In 2002, the first survey of the wreck was done by a team led by [[James P. Delgado]] for the ''[[Sea Hunters]]'' documentary produced by the [[National Underwater and Marine Agency]]. The team included the archaeologist Dr. [[Willi Kramer]], the first German to visit the wreck since she sank eighty-eight years before.<ref>Delgado, p. 175</ref> ''Dresden'' lies on her starboard side pointed north, toward the beach. The wreck is has been heavily damaged; much of the upper works, including the bridge, the masts, the funnels, and many of the guns have been torn from the ship. The bow has been cut off; it sits upright on the sea floor. The destruction of the bow was a result of the scuttling charges detonated by the ship's crew. The stern is also badly damaged, with the main deck blasted away and many shell holes in the ship's side.<ref>Delgado, pp. 177&ndash;178</ref> Some of the damage to the aft part of the ship appears to have been done by an undocumented salvage operation sometime before Delgado's survey. According to German records, ''Dresden'' was carrying gold coins from their colony at [[Tsingtau]]; Delgado speculated that this salvage work was an attempt to retrieve the gold.<ref>Delgado, p. 180</ref>

In 1965, the ship's compass and flags were recovered and returned to Germany, where they are held at the [[Naval Academy at M<U+00FC>rwik]].<ref name=G106/> In 2006, Chilean and German divers found and recovered ''Dresden''{{'}}s [[Ship's bell|bell]], which is now in Germany.<ref name=wrecksite>{{cite web | last = | first = | title = SMS Dresden (+1915) | url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?137412 | accessdate = 13 August 2013}}</ref> [[CS Forester]]'s novel ''[[Brown on Resolution]]'', and two subsequent movies, were inspired by the ''Dresden'''s escape and subsequent destruction.<ref>Kanagasingam, p. 83</ref>
