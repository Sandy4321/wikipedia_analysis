'''A bronze statue of William the Silent''' (also known as '''Willie the Silent''' and '''Still Bill''') was installed in 1928 on the [[Voorhees Mall]] section of [[Rutgers University]]{{'}}s College Avenue Campus in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]. It is located along Seminary Place, a street at the western end of the Voorhees Mall, and is near several academic buildings, including the university's [[Graduate School of Education (Rutgers University)|Graduate School of Education]], Van Dyke Hall, and Milledoler Hall.

The statue was donated to Rutgers by Dr. Fenton B. Turck to commemorate the university's Dutch heritage. Turck, with the assistance of railroad executive and Rutgers alumnus [[Leonor F. Loree]], collaborated to arrange the anonymous donation of the statue through the [[Holland Society of New York]]. It is a statue of [[William the Silent|William I, Prince of Orange]] (1533-1584), an early leader of the [[Dutch revolt]] against the Spanish which led to the independence of the Netherlands in 1648. The statue has continued to be included in student life as the Voorhees Mall was used as the site of student and community events, including graduation ceremonies, pep rallies, festivals, and protests. Occasionally, the statue is a target of vandalism in ongoing historical rivalry between students of Rutgers and [[Princeton University]]. Student tradition at Rutgers alleges that the statue will whistle should a female virgin happen to pass by.  The statue was restored in 2006 in an effort funded by alumni donations.

Rutgers students affectionately call the statue "Willie the Silent" and "Still Bill." According to student tradition, the statue is expected to whistle should a virgin happen to walk by.  However, Rutgers [[American studies]] professor and [[folklorist]] Angus Kress Gillespie remarked "But over the last 200 years, he hasn't yet whistled."<ref name="WillieFacultySpirit" /> Nevertheless, the statue has continued to be included in student life as the Voorhees Mall was used as the site of student and community events, graduation ceremonies (until 2007), pep rallies for the football team and other athletic teams, Dutch-American festivals, as well as protests including anti-war protests and strike rallies in the 1970s.<ref name="WillieFacultySpirit" /><ref name="WilliamstandstallTargum" /><ref>Pitt, Larry, ''Football at Rutgers: A History, 1869-1969'' (New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University College Football Centennial Committee, 1972), 79.</ref> On the afternoon of 11 October 1976, [[United States Senator]] [[Ted Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]] held a campaign rally at Rutgers during the [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|presidential election of 1976]].

In 1928, the statue of William the Silent was installed at the western end of [[Voorhees Mall]], a section of academic buildings on the College Avenue Campus in New Brunswick. It is located along Seminary Place, a city street that flanks the western side of the Mall, and separates the Rutgers campus from that of the [[New Brunswick Theological Seminary]]. The statue is placed near several academic buildings, including the university's [[Graduate School of Education (Rutgers University)|Graduate School of Education]], Van Dyke Hall, and Milledoler Hall.<ref name="SIArtInventory" /><ref>Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.
