The '''1998 FA Charity Shield''' (also known as the '''AXA FA Charity Shield''' for sponsorship reasons) was the 76th [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]], an annual English [[association football|football]] match organised by [[The Football Association]] and played between the winners of the previous season's [[Premier League]] and [[FA Cup]] competitions. It was contested on 9 August 1998 by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] <U+2013> who won a [[1997<U+2013>98 FA Premier League|league]] and [[1997<U+2013>98 FA Cup|FA Cup]] [[Double (association football)|double]] the previous season <U+2013> and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] <U+2013> who finished runners-up in the league. Watched by a crowd of 67,342 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], Arsenal won the match 3<U+2013>0.

This was Manchester United's 18th Charity Shield appearance to Arsenal's 14th. Manchester United began the game more strongly, but Arsenal took the lead when [[Marc Overmars]] scored 11 minutes before half-time. They extended their lead in the second half, as Overmars and [[Nicolas Anelka]] found [[Christopher Wreh]], who put the ball into an empty net at the second attempt. In the 72nd minute, Arsenal scored a third goal, when Anelka got around [[Jaap Stam]] in the penalty box and shot the ball past goalkeeper [[Peter Schmeichel]].

Arsenal's victory marked Manchester United's first Shield defeat in 13 years. The teams later faced each other in the [[1998<U+2013>99 FA Cup#Semi-finals|FA Cup semi-final]], which was won by Manchester United in a replay. Manchester United finished the league season one point ahead of Arsenal and went on to win the FA Cup and [[1998<U+2013>99 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]], thereby completing a [[Treble (association football)|treble]] of trophies in the [[1998<U+2013>99 in English football|1998<U+2013>99]] season.

Arsenal employed a traditional [[Formation (association football)#4<U+2013>4<U+2013>2|4<U+2013>4<U+2013>2]] formation: a four-man [[Defender (association football)|defence]] (comprising two [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre-backs]] and [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left and right full-backs]]), four [[midfielders]] (two in the [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|centre]], and one on each [[Midfielders#Wide midfielder|wing]]) and two [[Forward (association football)#Centre forward|centre-forwards]].<ref name="guard">{{cite news |first=David |last=Lacey |title=Wenger's all-stars write an epitaph to United; FA Charity Shield Arsenal 3 Manchester United 0: Overmars sets Double winners on way to victory that promises more success |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=10 August 1998 |page=21}}</ref> Manchester United organised themselves slightly differently, with [[Paul Scholes]] playing ahead of the midfield in a supporting role behind the main striker, [[Andy Cole]].

===Summary===
In pitch-side temperatures of {{convert|30|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}},<ref name="reporttwo"/> Manchester United enjoyed their best spell of the match early on, while Arsenal's pair [[Patrick Vieira]] and [[Emmanuel Petit]] adjusted themselves.<ref name="guard"/> United fashioned their first chance through [[David Beckham]], who was booed throughout the match on account of many fans blaming him for [[England national football team|England]]'s elimination from the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]].<ref name="guard"/>{{#tag:ref|Beckham was [[Red card (association football)#Red card (dismissal)|sent off]] for kicking [[Diego Simeone]] in the second round of the 1998 World Cup against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. His dismissal led to considerable abuse from certain sections of the media and England fans. The player became a scapegoat for the national team's failure to progress, as in the match England were eliminated on [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Hill |title=Beckham |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/beckham-1171687.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=15 August 1998 |accessdate=13 August 2013}}</ref>|group=lower-alpha}} His pass eventually met Scholes, whose attempt forced Arsenal goalkeeper [[David Seaman]] to clear.<ref name="report">{{cite news |first=Oliver |last=Holt |title=Arsenal warm to their second home |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=10 August 1998 |page=32 }}</ref> In spite of United's promising start, it was Arsenal who scored the opening goal. Vieira played the ball down the right side of the penalty area in the direction of Bergkamp and Anelka. Bergkamp got there first and back-heeled the ball to Anelka, but the Frenchman was unable to take control; however, he was able to put pressure on Johnsen in the Manchester United defence and blocked the Norwegian's attempted clearance. The ball ran across the edge of the penalty area to Overmars, who lashed it right-footed past Manchester United goalkeeper [[Peter Schmeichel]] into the net.<ref name="report"/> A shot by Keane from {{convert|25|yd}} prompted a save from Seaman in the 42nd minute.<ref name="reporttwo"/>

Arsenal began dominating in the second half, and increased their lead after 57 minutes. From the left wing, Overmars used his pace to get the better of [[Gary Neville]] and passed the ball to Anelka, who turned and passed to an unmarked [[Christopher Wreh]]. Schmeichel blocked the Liberian's initial shot with his feet, but he was unable to stop the second attempt or Wreh's acrobatic celebration.<ref name="reporttwo"/> Despite the setback, United continued to press Arsenal; defender [[Martin Keown]] almost put the ball into his own goal from [[Ryan Giggs]]'s corner.<ref name="reporttwo"/> Both teams made mass substitutions in the final third of the game, notably [[Teddy Sheringham]] and [[Lu<U+00ED>s Boa Morte]] coming on for Cole <U+2013> who rarely threatened <U+2013> and Petit, respectively.<ref name="report"/> Arsenal scored their third in the 72nd minute <U+2013> Parlour's pass found Anelka, who got around Stam and shot the ball past Schmeichel from a narrow angle, inside the goalkeeper's near post.<ref name="report"/> Near the end, Sheringham wasted a goal-scoring opportunity, shooting wide.<ref>{{cite news |title=Boo-boy Beckham fails to paper over Ferguson's cracks |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Boo-boy+Beckham+fails+to+paper+over+Ferguson%27s+cracks%3b+Arsenal+3...-a061434512 |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=10 August 1998}}</ref>
