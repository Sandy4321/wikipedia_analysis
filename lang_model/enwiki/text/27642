'''Wells Cathedral''' is a [[Church of England]] place of worship in [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]], [[Somerset]] dedicated to [[St Andrew the Apostle]], and is the seat of the [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]]. As with other [[cathedral]]s, it is the central church of a [[Diocese of Bath and Wells|diocese]] and contains the bishop's throne ([[cathedra]]).  The present building dates from 1175 to 1490, an earlier church having been built on the site in 705. It is moderately sized among the [[Architecture of the medieval cathedrals of England|medieval cathedrals of England]], falling between those of massive proportion, such as [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]] and [[York Minster|York]], and the much smaller cathedrals of [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford|Oxford]] and [[Carlisle Cathedral|Carlisle]]. With its broad west front and large central tower, it is the dominant feature of its small [[City status in the United Kingdom|cathedral city]] and a landmark in the Somerset countryside.{{sfn|Swaan|1984|pp=188<U+2013>196}} Wells has been variously described as "unquestionably one of the most beautiful"<ref>Oggins, Robin. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=DtS2iD79NgEC&pg=PA42 Cathedrals]'', p. 42 (Sterling Publishing Company 1996).</ref> and as "the most poetic" of English cathedrals.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|p=274}}

The architecture of the cathedral presents a harmonious whole which is entirely [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and mostly in a single style, the [[Early English Gothic]] of the late 12th and early 13th centuries. In this Wells differs from most other English medieval cathedrals, which have parts in the earlier [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] architectural style introduced to Britain by the [[Normans]] in the 11th century.

Work on the cathedral commenced in about 1175 at the eastern end with the building of the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]]. The historian [[John Harvey (historian)|John Harvey]] considers this to be the first truly Gothic structure in Europe, having broken from the last constraints of Romanesque.{{sfn|Harvey|1987|p=19}} The stonework of its pointed [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s and fluted [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] is enriched by the complexity of the pronounced mouldings and vitality of the carved [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] in a foliate style known as "stiff leaf".{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|p=77}} The exterior has an Early English fa<U+00E7>ade displaying more than three hundred sculpted figures,{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|p=274}} and described by Harvey as "the supreme triumph of the combined [[plastic arts]] in England".{{sfn|Harvey|1961|p=63}} The eastern end retains much ancient [[stained glass]], which is rare in England.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|p=274}}

Unlike the many English [[Cathedral#Late Middle Ages: monastic and secular cathedrals|cathedrals of monastic foundation]], Wells has an exceptional number of surviving secular buildings associated with its chapter of [[Canon (priest)|secular canons]], such as the [[Bishop's Palace, Wells|Bishop's Palace]] and the [[Vicars' Close, Wells|Vicars' Close]], a residential street which has remained intact from the 15th century.{{sfn|Swaan|1984|pp=188<U+2013>196}} The cathedral is a [[scheduled monument]] and is designated by [[English Heritage]] as a Grade I [[Listed building (United Kingdom)|listed building]].<ref name="ehlisting">{{NHLE |num=1382901 |desc=Cathedral Church of St Andrew, Chapter House and Cloisters |accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=pastscape/>

The earliest remains of a building on the site are of a late [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[mausoleum]], identified during excavations in 1980.<ref name=pastscape>{{cite web |title=Wells Cathedral |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=196971 |work=Pastscape&nbsp;<U+2013> National Monument Record |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref>{{sfn|Adkins|1992|pp=118<U+2013>119}} An abbey church was built in [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]] in 705 by [[Aldhelm]], first bishop of the newly established [[Bishop of Sherborne|Diocese of Sherborne]] during the reign of King [[Ine of Wessex]].<ref name=britania>{{cite web|title=The History and Architecture of Wells Cathedral in Somerset, Part 1|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/somerset/churches/wellscath.html|publisher=Britannia|accessdate=11 July 2013}}</ref>{{sfn|Malden|1947|p=27}} It was dedicated to [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] and stood at the present site of the cathedral's [[cloister]]s, where some excavated remains can be seen. The [[baptismal font]] in the cathedral's south [[transept]] is from this church and is the oldest part of the present building.{{sfn|Pepin|2004|p=141}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Chronological History|url=http://www.wellscathedral.org.uk/history/timeline/|publisher=Wells Cathedral|accessdate=15 February 2014}}</ref> In 766 [[Cynewulf of Wessex|Cynewulf]], [[List of monarchs of Wessex|King of Wessex]], signed a charter endowing the church with eleven [[Hide (unit)|hides]] of land.{{efn|name= Hides|A [[Hide (unit)|hide of land]] was a unit of land sufficient to support a family. Considered as a fiscal unit, the use of the hide in the [[Domesday Book]] shows that it was variable from county to county, but generally about 120 "acres" (not 120 acres of 4840 sq. yds. each, but 120 times the amount of land which a ploughteam of eight oxen could plough in a single day).<ref name=Hide>{{cite web|title=Glossary|url=http://www.domesdaybook.co.uk/glossary.html|publisher=Domesday Book Online|accessdate=15 February 2014}}</ref> }}<ref name="LapidgeBlair2013">{{cite book|last1=Lapidge|first1=Michael |last2=Blair|first2=John |last3=Keynes|first3=Simon |first4=Donald |last4=Scragg|title=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WaAzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA243|date=2 October 2013|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-31609-2|pages=243<U+2013>44|chapter=Hide}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Wells Cathedral |url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=15381 |work=Somerset Historic Environment Record |publisher=[[Somerset County Council]] |accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> In 909 the seat of the diocese was moved from Sherborne to Wells.<ref name=pastscape/>

The first Bishop of Wells was [[Athelm]] (909), who crowned [[<U+00C6>thelstan|King <U+00C6>thelstan]].

===Seat of the bishop===
The cathedral is thought to have been conceived and commenced in about 1175 by Bishop [[Reginald Fitz Jocelin]], who died in 1191.{{sfn|Harvey|1987|p=57}}{{sfn|Powicke|1961|p=251}}{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=13}} Although it is clear from its size that, from the outset, the church was planned to be the cathedral of the diocese,{{sfn|Tatton-Brown|Crook|2002|pp=74<U+2013>76}} the seat of the bishop moved between Wells and the abbeys of [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]] and [[Bath Abbey|Bath]], before settling at Wells. In 1197 Bishop Reginald's successor, Bishop [[Savaric FitzGeldewin]], with the approval of [[Pope Celestine III]], officially moved his seat to Glastonbury Abbey. The title of Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury was used until the Glastonbury claim was abandoned in 1219.{{sfn|Brooke|1976|pp=184<U+2013>185}}

Bishop Savaric's successor, [[Jocelin of Wells]], again moved the bishop's seat to Bath Abbey, with the title Bishop of Bath. Jocelin was a brother of [[Hugh of Wells|Bishop Hugh II of Lincoln]]<ref name=BHOBath>{{cite web |url=http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=34341 |title=Bishops |first=Diana E. |last=Greenway |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=2001 |work=Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: volume 7: Bath and Wells |accessdate=10 July 2013 }}</ref> and was present at the signing of the [[Magna Carta]]. Bishop Jocelin continued the building campaign begun by Bishop Reginald and was responsible for the [[Bishop's Palace, Wells|Bishop's Palace]], the [[choir|chorister]]s' school, a [[grammar school]], a hospital for travellers and a chapel. He also had a manor house built at [[Wookey]], near Wells.<ref name=DNB/> Jocelin saw the church dedicated in 1239 but, despite much lobbying of the pope by Jocelin's representatives in Rome, did not live to see cathedral status granted. The delay may have been a result of inaction by [[Pandulf Masca]], a Roman ecclesiastical politician, papal legate to England and [[Bishop of Norwich]], who was asked by the pope to investigate the situation but did not respond.{{sfn|Colchester|1987|p=15}} Jocelin died at Wells on 19 November 1242 and was buried in the choir of the cathedral;<ref name="BHOBath" /><ref name=DNB>{{cite web |last=Dunning |first=Robert |title=Wells, Jocelin of (d. 1242) |publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14831 |accessdate=15 November 2007}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref>{{sfn|Fryde|1986|p=228}} the [[Monumental brass|memorial brass]] on his tomb is one of the earliest brasses in England.<ref name=DNB/> Following his death the monks of Bath unsuccessfully attempted to regain authority over Wells.{{sfn|Robinson|1916|p=161}}

In 1245 the ongoing dispute over the title of the bishop was resolved by a ruling of [[Pope Innocent IV]] who established the title as the "Bishop of Bath and Wells", as it has remained until this day, with Wells as the principal seat of the bishop.{{sfn|Dunning|2001|p=41}} Since the 11th century the church has had a [[Cathedral chapter|chapter]] of secular clergy, like the cathedrals of [[Chichester Cathedral|Chichester]], [[Hereford Cathedral|Hereford]], [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]] and [[York Minster|York]]. The chapter was endowed with twenty-two [[prebendary|prebends]] (lands from which finance was drawn) and a provost to manage them. On acquiring cathedral status, in common with other such cathedrals, it had four chief clergy, the [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]], [[precentor]], [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|chancellor]] and [[sacristan]], who were responsible for the spiritual and material care of the cathedral.<ref name=CofEmedia>{{cite book |publisher=Church of England|last=Podmore|first=Colin|date=July 2008|chapterurl=http://www.churchofengland.org/media/40671/chapter5.pdf |format=PDF |title=Dioceses and Episcopal Sees in England|chapter=Chapter 5: Old Foundation cathedrals }}</ref>

===Building the cathedral===
The building program which was begun by Bishop Reginald Fitz Jocelin in the 12th century continued under Jocelin of Wells, who was a canon from 1200, then bishop from 1206. Adam Locke was master mason from about 1192 until 1230.{{sfn|Harvey|1987|p=163}}  It was designed in the new style with pointed arches, later known as [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], and which was introduced at about the same time at [[Canterbury Cathedral]].{{sfn|Harvey|1987|pp=57<U+2013>58}}  Work was halted between 1209 and 1213 when [[John, King of England|King John]] was [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] and Bishop Jocelin was in exile,{{sfn|Reid|1963|pp=40<U+2013>41}} but the main parts of the church were complete by the time of the dedication by Bishop Jocelin in 1239.{{sfn|Tatton-Brown|Crook|2002|pp=74<U+2013>76}}

By the time the cathedral, including the [[chapter house]], was finished in 1306,<ref name=sacred>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/england/wells-cathedral |title=Wells Cathedral |accessdate=3 February 2013 |publisher=Sacred destinations }}</ref> it was already too small for the developing liturgy, and unable to accommodate increasingly grand processions of clergy. Bishop [[John Droxford]] initiated another phase of building under master mason Thomas of Whitney,<ref name=sacred/> during which the central tower was heightened and an eight-sided [[Lady chapel]], completed by 1326, was added at the east end.<ref name=isleofavalon>{{cite web |url=http://www.isleofalbion.co.uk/sites/102/wells_cathedral.php |title=Wells Cathedral|accessdate=3 February 2013 |publisher=Isle of Albion }}</ref> Bishop [[Ralph of Shrewsbury]] followed, continuing the eastward extension of the choir and [[retrochoir]] beyond. He oversaw the building of [[Vicars' Close, Wells|Vicars' Close]] and the Vicars' Hall, to give the men who were employed to sing in the choir a secure place to live and dine, away from the town and its temptations.<ref name="localhist">{{cite web |url=http://www.wells-uk.com/local_history.php |title=Local history |accessdate=10 February 2008 |publisher=Wells UK |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071224145315/http://www.wells-uk.com/local_history.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=24 December 2007}}</ref> He had an uneasy relationship with the citizens of Wells, partly because of his imposition of taxes,<ref name="localhist" /> and he surrounded his palace with [[Battlement|crenellated]] walls, a moat and a drawbridge.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-769-1/dissemination/pdf/vol26/26_069_100.pdf |title=Hierarchism in Conventual Crenellation |last=Coulson |first=Charles |publisher=Society for Medieval Archaeology|format=PDF |accessdate=24 February 2013|journal=Medieval Archaeology|volume= 26 |pages=pp. 69<U+2013>100|ref=harv}}{{registration required}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bishopspalace.org.uk/attachments/The%20Palace%20Rooms.pdf |title=Bishop's Palace Timeline |publisher=Bishops Palace |format=PDF |accessdate=24 February 2013}}</ref>

Bishop [[John Harewell]] raised money for the completion of the west front by [[William Wynford]], who was appointed as master mason in 1365. One of the foremost architects of his time, Wynford worked for the king at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], [[Winchester Cathedral]] and [[New College, Oxford]].{{sfn|Harvey|1987|p=352}} At Wells, he designed the western towers of which north-west was not built until the following century.{{sfn|Wade|1926|p=257}} In the 14th century, the central [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] of the [[crossing (architecture)|crossing]] were found to be sinking under the weight of the crossing tower which had been damaged by an earthquake the previous century.<ref name=cathbrit>{{cite web |title=The cathedrals of Britain |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/architecture_cathedral_01.shtml |publisher=BBC |accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> Strainer arches, sometimes described as scissor arches, were inserted by master mason [[William Joy (master mason)|William Joy]] to brace and stabilise the piers as a unit.<ref name=cathbrit/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://timeref.com/hpl285.htm |title=Wells Cathedral |accessdate=10 February 2008 |publisher=Timeref }}</ref>

===Tudors and Civil War===
By the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] the cathedral building was complete, appearing much as it does today (though the fittings have changed considerably). From 1508 to 1546, the eminent Italian [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholar [[Polydore Vergil]] was active as the chapter's representative in London. He donated a set of hangings for the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] of the cathedral.{{sfn|Hay|1952|pp=8<U+2013>20}}<ref>{{cite journal |first=Oliver |last=Harris |title=Polydore Vergil's hangings in the quire of Wells Cathedral |journal=Somerset Archaeology and Local History |volume=149 |year=2006 |pages=71<U+2013>77 |ref=harv }}</ref> While Wells survived the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] better than those cathedrals of monastic foundation, the abolition of chantries in 1547 resulted in a reduction in the cathedral's income. [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] brasses were sold, and a [[pulpit]] was placed in the [[nave]] for the first time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wellscathedral.org.uk/history/timeline/the-reformation/ |title=The Reformation |accessdate=2 September 2011 |publisher=Wells Cathedral }}</ref> Between 1551 and 1568, in two periods as dean, [[William Turner (naturalist)|William Turner]] established a [[Herb garden|herbal garden]], which was recreated between 2003 and 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.olddeanerygarden.org.uk/index.php |title=The Old Deanery Garden, Wells |author=The Diocese of Bath and Wells |work=olddeanerygarden.org.uk |year=2013 |accessdate=23 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Adler |first=Mark |date=May 2010|title=Haunt of ancient peace |publisher=''Mendip Times'' |pages=36<U+2013>37}}</ref>

[[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] gave the chapter and the Vicars Choral a new charter in 1591, creating a new governing body, consisting of the dean and eight residentiary canons with control over the church estates and authority over its affairs, but no longer entitled to elect the dean (that entitlement thenceforward belonged ultimately to [[the Crown]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=40953 |title=Colleges: The cathedral of Wells |editor-first=William|editor-last= Page |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1911 |work=A History of the County of Somerset: Volume 2 |accessdate=3 January 2013 }}</ref> The stability brought by the new charter ended with the onset of the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] and the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Local fighting damaged the cathedral's stonework, furniture and windows. The dean, [[Walter Raleigh (priest)|Walter Raleigh]], a nephew of the explorer [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]], was placed under house arrest after the fall of [[Bridgwater]] to the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] in 1645, first  in the rectory at [[Chedzoy]] and then in the deanery at Wells.<ref>{{cite web |last=Marchant |first=E.C. |title=Ralegh, Walter (1586<U+2013>1646) Dean of Wells |publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23040 |accessdate=15 November 2007}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> His jailer, the shoe maker and city constable, David Barrett, caught him writing a letter to his wife.

===1660<U+2013>1800===
In 1661, after [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] was restored to the throne, [[Robert Creighton]], who had served as the king's chaplain in exile, was appointed dean and then served as the bishop for two years before his death in 1672.{{sfn|Lehmberg|1996|p=55}} His brass [[lectern]], given in thanksgiving, can be seen in the cathedral. He also donated the great west window of the nave at a cost of <U+00A3>140. Following Creighton's appointment as bishop, [[Ralph Bathurst]], who had been chaplain to the king, president of [[Trinity College, Oxford]] and fellow of the [[Royal Society]],{{sfn|Hopkins|2005|p=161}} became dean. During Bathurst's long tenure the cathedral was restored, however in the [[Monmouth Rebellion]] of 1685, Puritan soldiers damaged the west front, tore lead from the roof to make bullets, broke the windows, smashed the organ and furnishings, and for a time stabled their horses in the nave.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/archives/ASH/Monmouthreb.htm |title=The Monmouth rebellion and the bloody assize |accessdate=11 February 2008 |publisher=[[Somerset County Council]] }}</ref>

Restoration began again under Bishop [[Thomas Ken]] who was appointed by the Crown in 1685 and served until 1691. He was one of seven bishops imprisoned for refusing to sign [[James II of England|King James II's]] "[[Declaration of Indulgence]]", which would have enabled Catholics to resume positions of political power, but popular support led to their acquittal. Ken refused to take the oath of allegiance to [[William and Mary]] because James II had not abdicated and with others, known as the [[Nonjuring schism|Nonjurors]], was put out of office.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ollard|first=S.L.|editor-first1=S.L.|editor-last1=Ollard|editor-first2=Gordon|editor-last2=Crosse|title=A Dictionary of English Church History|chapter=The Nonjurors|chapterurl=http://anglicanhistory.org/nonjurors/ollard_crosse1912.html|publisher=Mowbray and Co.|date=1912}}</ref> His successor, [[Richard Kidder|Bishop Kidder]], was killed in the [[Great Storm of 1703]] when two chimney stacks on the palace fell on him and his wife, while they were asleep in bed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Richard Kidder (1633<U+2013>1703), Bishop of Bath and Wells (1691<U+2013>1703) |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/richard-kidder-16331703-bishop-of-bath-and-wells-16911703-39388 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cassan|first=Stephen Hyde|title=Lives of the Bishops of Bath|year=1829|publisher=C and J Rivington|page=163|url=http://books.google.com/?id=OJgAAAAAcAAJ&pg=RA1-PA163&lpg=RA1-PA163&dq=Bishop+Kidder+1703+death#v=onepage&q=Bishop%20Kidder%201703%20death&f=false}}</ref>

===Victorian era to present===
By the middle of the 19th century, a major [[Victorian restoration|restoration programme]] was needed. Under [[Edmund Goodenough|Dean Goodenough]], the monuments were moved to the cloisters and the remaining medieval paint and [[whitewash]] was removed in an operation known as "the great scrape".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wellscathedral.org.uk/history/timeline/249-2/ |title=Victorian Restorations |accessdate=2 September 2011 |publisher=Wells Cathedral }}</ref> [[Anthony Salvin]] took charge of the extensive restoration of the choir. Wooden galleries that had been installed in the 16th century were removed and the stalls were given stone canopies and placed further back within the line of the arcade. The medieval stone [[pulpitum]] screen was extended in the centre to support a new [[organ (music)|organ]].{{sfn|Colchester|1987|pp=126<U+2013>7}}

Construction of the cathedral began in about 1175, to the design of an unknown architect. Wells is the first cathedral in England to be, from its foundation, built in the Gothic style. According to art historian [[John Harvey (historian)|John Harvey]], it is the first truly Gothic cathedral in the world, its architects having entirely dispensed with all the features that bound the contemporary east end of Canterbury Cathedral and the earlier buildings of France, such as the east end of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis|Abbey of Saint Denis]], to the Romanesque.{{sfn|Harvey|1987|p=19}} Unlike these churches, Wells has clustered piers rather than columns and has a gallery of identical pointed arches rather than the typically Romanesque form of paired openings. The style, with its simple untraceried [[lancet arch]]es and convoluted mouldings, is known as [[English Gothic architecture#Early English Gothic|Early English Gothic]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1961|pp=189<U+2013>90}}

From about 1192 to 1230, Adam Lock, the earliest architect at Wells for whom a name is known, continued the transept and nave in the same manner as his predecessor.  Lock was also builder of the north porch, to his own design.{{sfn|Harvey|1987|p=163}}

The Early English west front was commenced around 1230 by Thomas Norreys, with building and sculpture continuing for thirty years.{{sfn|Harvey|1987|p=163}} Its south-west tower was begun 100 years later and constructed between 1365 and 1395, and the north-west tower between 1425 and 1435, both in the [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular Gothic]] style to the design of William Wynford, {{sfn|Harvey|1987|p=163}} who also filled many of the cathedral's early English [[lancet window]]s with delicate [[tracery]].{{sfn|Wade|1926|p=257}}
Between 1275 and 1310 the [[undercroft]] and chapterhouse were built by unknown architects, the undercroft in the Early English and the chapter house in the Geometric style of [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Decorated Gothic]] architecture. In about 1310 work commenced on the Lady Chapel, to the design of Thomas Witney, who also built the central tower from 1315 to 1322 in the Decorated Gothic style.{{sfn|Harvey|1987|p=163}} The tower was later braced internally with arches by William Joy.{{sfn|Harvey|1987|p=163}} Concurrent with this work, in 1329<U+2013>45 Joy made alterations and extensions to the choir, joining it to the Lady Chapel with the retrochoir, the latter in the [[English Gothic#Decorated Gothic|Flowing Decorated]] style.{{sfn|Harvey|1987|p=163}}

Later changes include the Perpendicular vault of the tower and construction of Sugar's Chapel, 1475<U+2013>90 by [[William Smyth (architect)|William Smyth]].  Also, Gothic Revival renovations were made to the choir and pulpitum by [[Benjamin Ferrey]] and Anthony Salvin, 1842<U+2013>57.{{sfn|Harvey|1987|p=163}}

===Plan===
Wells has a total length of {{convert|415|ft|m}}. In common with Canterbury, Lincoln and [[Salisbury Cathedral|Salisbury]] cathedrals, it has the distinctly English arrangement of two transepts, with the body of the church divided into distinct parts: nave, choir, and retrochoir, beyond which extends the Lady Chapel.{{sfn|Swaan|1984|pp=173<U+2013>174}} The fa<U+00E7>ade is wide, with its towers extending beyond the transepts on either side.{{sfn|Swaan|1984|pp=188<U+2013>196}} There is a large projecting porch on the north side of the nave forming an entry into the cathedral.{{sfn|Pevsner|1958|pp=278<U+2013>310}} To the north-east is the large octagonal chapter house, entered from the north choir aisle by a passage and staircase. To the south of the nave is a large cloister, unusual in that the northern range, that adjacent the cathedral, was never built.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|p=136}}

===Elevation===
In section, the cathedral has the usual arrangement of a large church: a central nave with an aisle on each side, separated by two arcades. The elevation is in three stages, [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]], [[Triforium|triforium gallery]] and [[clerestory]].{{sfn|Pevsner|1958|pp=278<U+2013>310}} The nave is {{convert|67|ft|m}} in height, very low compared to the Gothic cathedrals of France.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|pp=74<U+2013>79}} It has a markedly horizontal emphasis, caused by the triforium having a unique form, a series of identical narrow openings, lacking the usual definition of the bays. The triforium is separated from the arcade by a single horizontal [[string course]] that runs unbroken the length of the nave. There are no vertical lines linking the three stages, as the shafts supporting the vault rise above the triforium.{{sfn|Pevsner|1958|pp=278<U+2013>310}}

===Exterior===
The exterior of Wells Cathedral presents a relatively tidy and harmonious appearance since the greater part of the building was executed in a single style, [[Early English Gothic]]. This is uncommon among English cathedrals where the exterior usually exhibits a plethora of styles.<ref name=reeve/> At Wells, later changes in the Perpendicular style were universally applied, such as filling the Early English lancet windows with simple tracery, the construction of a [[parapet]] that encircles the roof, and the addition of [[pinnacle]]s framing each [[gable]], similar to those around the chapter house and on the west front.{{sfn|Pevsner|1958|pp=278<U+2013>310}} At the eastern end there is a proliferation of tracery with repeated motifs in the Reticulated style, a stage between Geometric and Flowing Decorated tracery.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|pp=156<U+2013>158}}

====West front====
The west front is {{convert|100|ft|m|0}} high and {{convert|147|ft|m|0}} wide,{{sfn|Colchester|1987|p=183}} and built of [[Inferior Oolite]] of the [[Middle Jurassic]] period, which came from the [[Doulting Stone Quarry]], about {{convert|8|mi|km|0}} to the east.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://doultingstonequarry.co.uk/?Quarry_History |archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20130814102745/http://doultingstonequarry.co.uk/?Quarry_History |archivedate=2013-08-14 |publisher=Doulting Stone |title=Quarry History |accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref> According to the [[architectural historian]] [[Alec Clifton-Taylor]], it is "one of the great sights of England".{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|p=78}}

West fronts in general take three distinct forms: those that follow the elevation of the nave and aisles, those that have paired towers at the end of each aisle, framing the nave, and those that screen the form of the building. The west front at Wells has the paired-tower form, unusual in that the towers do not indicate the location of the aisles, but extend well beyond them, screening the dimensions and profile of the building.{{sfn|Swaan|1984|pp=188<U+2013>196}}

The west front rises in three distinct stages, each clearly defined by a horizontal course. This horizontal emphasis is counteracted by six strongly projecting buttresses defining the cross-sectional divisions of nave, aisles and towers, and are highly decorated, each having canopied niches containing the largest statues on the fa<U+00E7>ade.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|p=78}}

At the lowest level of the fa<U+00E7>ade is a plain base, contrasting with and stabilising the ornate arcades that rise above it.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|p=78}} The base is penetrated by three doors, which are in stark contrast to the often imposing portals of French Gothic cathedrals. The outer two are of domestic proportion and the central door is ornamented only by a central post, [[quatrefoil]] and the fine mouldings of the arch.{{sfn|Swaan|1984|pp=188<U+2013>196}}

Above the basement rise two storeys, ornamented with quatrefoils and niches originally holding about four hundred statues, with three hundred surviving until the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Swaan|1984|pp=188<U+2013>196}} Since then, some have been restored or replaced, including the ruined figure of Christ in the gable.<ref name=Caroe/>

The third stages of the flanking towers were both built in the Perpendicular style of the late 14th century, to the design of William Wynford; that on the north-west was not begun until about 1425.{{sfn|Harvey|1987|p=163}} The design maintains the general proportions, and continues the strong projection of the buttresses.

The finished product has been criticised for its lack of pinnacles, and it is probable that the towers were intended to carry spires which were never built.{{sfn|Pevsner|1958|pp=278<U+2013>310}} Despite its lack of spires or pinnacles, the architectural historian [[Sir Banister Fletcher|Banister Fletcher]] describes it as "the highest development in English Gothic of this type of facade." {{sfn|Fletcher|1961|p=421}}

=====Iconography of the west front=====
The sculptures on the west front at Wells include standing figures, seated figures, half-length angels and narratives in high relief. Many of the figures are life-sized or larger, and together they constitute the finest display of medieval carving in England.{{sfn|Swaan|1984|pp=188<U+2013>196}} The figures and many of the architectural details were painted in bright colours, and the colouring scheme has been deduced from flakes of paint still adhering to some surfaces.{{sfn|Swaan|1984|pp=188<U+2013>196}} The sculptures occupy nine architectural zones stretching horizontally across the entire west front and around the sides and the eastern [[Architectural glossary#R|returns]] of the towers which extend beyond the aisles. The strongly projecting buttresses have tiers of niches which contain many of the largest figures. Other large figures, including that of Christ, occupy the gable. A single figure stands in one of two later niches high on the northern tower.

In 1851 the archaeologist [[Charles Robert Cockerell]] published his analysis of the iconography, numbering the nine sculptural divisions from the lowest to the highest. He defined the theme as "a calendar for unlearned men" illustrating the doctrines and history of the Christian faith, its introduction to Britain and its protection by princes and bishops.{{sfn|Cockerell|1851|p=26}} He likens the arrangement and iconography to the [[Te Deum]].{{sfn|Cockerell|1851|p=34}}

According to Cockerell, the side of the facade that is to the south of the central door is the more sacred and the scheme is divided accordingly.{{sfn|Cockerell|1851|p=27}} The lowest range of niches each contained a standing figure, of which all but four figures on the west front, two on each side, have been destroyed. More have survived on the northern and eastern sides of the north tower. Cockerell speculates that those to the south of the portal represented prophets and patriarchs of the [[Old Testament]] while those to the north represented early missionaries to Britain, of which [[Augustine of Canterbury]], [[St Birinus]], and [[Benedict Biscop]] are identifiable by their [[Saint symbolism|attributes]].{{sfn|Cockerell|1851|pp= 27<U+2013>28}} In the second zone, above each pair of standing figures, is a quatrefoil containing a half-length angel in relief, some of which have survived.{{sfn|Cockerell|1851|p=52}} Between the gables of the niches are quatrefoils that contain a series of narratives from the Bible, with the Old Testament stories to the south, above the prophets and patriarchs, and those from the New Testament to the north.{{sfn|Cockerell|1851|p=53}} A horizontal course runs around the west front dividing the architectural storeys at this point.

Above the course, zones four and five, as identified by Cockerell, contain figures which represent the Christian Church in Britain, with the spiritual lords such as bishops, abbots, abbesses and saintly founders of monasteries on the south, while kings, queens and princes occupy the north.{{sfn|Cockerell|1851|p=30}} Many of the figures survive and many have been identified in the light of their various attributes. There is a hierarchy of size, with the more significant figures larger and enthroned in their niches rather than standing.{{sfn|Cockerell|1851|p=75}} Immediately beneath the upper course are a series of small niches containing dynamic sculptures of the dead coming forth from their tombs on the [[Day of Judgement]]. Although naked, some of the dead are defined as royalty by their crowns and others as bishops by their mitres. Some emerge from their graves with joy and hope, and others with despair.{{sfn|Cockerell|1851|p=31}}

The niches in the lowest zone of the gable contain nine angels, of which Cockerell identifies Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel.{{sfn|Cockerell|1851|p=32}} In the next zone are the taller figures of the twelve apostles, some, such as John, Andrew and Bartholomew, clearly identifiable by the attributes that they carry.{{sfn|Cockerell|1851|p=33}} The uppermost niches of the gable contained the figure of Christ the Judge at the centre, with the Virgin Mary on his right and John the Baptist on his left. The figures all suffered from [[iconoclasm]].{{sfn|Cockerell|1851|p=33}} A new statue of Jesus was carved for the central niche, but the two side niches now contain [[cherub]]im. Christ and the Virgin Mary are also represented by now headless figures in a [[Coronation of the Virgin]] in a niche above the central portal. A damaged figure of the Virgin and Christ Child occupies a quatrefoil in the [[spandrel]] of the door.{{sfn|Cockerell|1851|pp=29<U+2013>30}}

====Crossing tower====
The central tower appears to date from the early 13th century. It was substantially reconstructed in the early 14th century during the remodelling of the east end, necessitating the internal bracing of the piers a decade or so later. In the 14th century the tower was given a timber and lead spire which burnt down in 1439. The exterior was then reworked in the Perpendicular style and given the present parapet and pinnacles.{{sfn|Tatton-Brown|Crook|2002|pp=74<U+2013>76}} Alec Clifton-Taylor describes it as "outstanding even in Somerset, a county famed for the splendour of its church towers".{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|p=274}}

====North porch====
The north porch is described by art historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] as "sumptuously decorated", and intended to be the main entrance.{{sfn|Pevsner|1958|pp=278<U+2013>310}} Externally it is simple and rectangular with plain side walls. The entrance is a steeply arched portal framed by rich mouldings of eight shafts with stiff-leaf capitals each encircled by an [[Annulet (architecture)|annular]] moulding at middle height. Those on the left are figurative, containing images representing the martyrdom of St [[Edmund the Martyr]].{{sfn|Pevsner|1958|pp=278<U+2013>310}} The walls are lined with deep niches framed by narrow shafts with capitals and annulets like those of the portal.

====Cloisters====
The cloisters were built in the late 13th century and largely rebuilt from 1430 to 1508{{sfn|Tatton-Brown|Crook|2002|pp=74<U+2013>76}}{{sfn|Harvey|1987|p=163}} and have wide openings divided by [[mullion]]s and [[Transom (architectural)|transom]]s, and tracery in the  Perpendicular Gothic style. The vault has [[Lierne (vault)|lierne]] ribs that form octagons at the centre of each compartment, the joints of each rib having decorative [[Boss (architecture)|bosses]].{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|p=226}} The eastern range is of two storeys, of which the upper is the library built in the 15th century.{{sfn|Tatton-Brown|Crook|2002|pp=74<U+2013>76}}

Because Wells Cathedral was secular rather than monastic, cloisters were not a practical necessity. They were omitted from several other secular cathedrals but were built here and at Chichester. Explanations for their construction at these two secular cathedrals range from the processional to the aesthetic.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|p=136}} As at Chichester, there is no northern range to the cloisters. In monastic cloisters it was the north range, benefiting most from winter sunlight, that was often used as a [[scriptorium]].{{sfn|Crossley|1962|pp=67<U+2013>68}}

====Restoration====
In 1969, when a large chunk of stone fell from a statue near the main door, it became apparent that there was an urgent need for restoration of the west front.<ref name=westfrontrestore/> Detailed studies of the stonework and of conservation practices were undertaken under the cathedral architect, Alban D. R. Caroe and a restoration committee formed.<ref name =Caroe/> The methods that were selected for conservation were those devised by Eve and Robert Baker.  W. A. (Bert) Wheeler, clerk of works to the cathedral 1935<U+2013>1978, had previously experimented with washing and surface-treatment of architectural carvings on the building and his techniques were among those tried on the statues.<ref name =Caroe/>

The conservation was carried out between 1974 and 1986, wherever possible using non-invasive procedures such as washing with water and a solution of [[Lime (material)|lime]], filling gaps and damaged surfaces with soft mortar to prevent the ingress of water and stabilising statues that were fracturing because of the corrosion of metal dowels. The surfaces were finished by painting with a thin coat of mortar and [[silane]] to resist further erosion and attack by pollutants.<ref name=westfrontrestore/><ref name =Caroe>{{cite journal |last=Caroe |first=M.

===Interior===

====Choir, transept and nave====
The particular character of this Early English<!---NOTE: "Early English" is the name of the style. Do not remove caps.---> interior is dependent on the proportions of the simple lancet arches. It is also dependent on the refinement of the architectural details, in particular the mouldings.

The arcade, which takes the same form in the nave, choir and transepts, is distinguished by the richness of both mouldings and carvings. Each pier of the arcade has a surface enrichment of twenty-four slender shafts in eight groups of three, rising beyond the [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] to form the deeply undulating mouldings of the arches.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|pp=74<U+2013>79}} The capitals themselves are remarkable for the vitality of the stylised foliage, in a style known as "stiff-leaf". The liveliness contrasts with the formality of the moulded shafts and the smooth unbroken areas of [[ashlar]] masonry in the spandrels. Each capital is different, and some contain small figures illustrating narratives.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor1967|pp=74<U+2013>79}}

The vault of the nave rises steeply in a simple quadripartite form, in harmony with the nave arcade.{{sfn|Pevsner|1958|pp=278<U+2013>310}} The eastern end of the choir was extended and the whole upper part elaborated in the second quarter of the 14th century by William Joy.{{sfn|Harvey|1987|p=163}} The vault has a multiplicity of ribs in a net-like form, which is very different from that of the nave, and is perhaps a recreation in stone of a local type of compartmented wooden roof of which examples remain from the 15th century, including those at [[Church of St Cuthbert, Wells|St Cuthbert's Church]], Wells.{{sfn|Swaan|1984|p=193}} The vaults of the aisles of the choir also have a unique pattern.{{sfn|Pevsner|1958|pp=278<U+2013>310}}

Until the early 14th century the interior of the cathedral was in a unified style, but it was to undergo two significant changes, to the tower and to the eastern end. Between 1315 and 1322 the central tower was heightened and topped by a spire which caused the piers that supported it to show signs of stress. In 1338 the mason William Joy employed an unorthodox solution by inserting low arches topped by inverted arches of similar dimensions, forming scissors-like structures. These arches brace the piers of the crossing on three sides, while the easternmost side is braced by a choir screen.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ingenia.org.uk/ingenia/issues/issue10/heyman.pdf |title=Why ancient cathedrals stand up: The structural design of masonry |accessdate=11 February 2008 |format=PDF |journal=Ingenia|issue=10|date=November 2001|first=Jacques |last=Heyman|ref=harv }}</ref> The bracing arches are known as the "St Andrew's Cross arches" as a reference to the patronal saint of the cathedral and have been described by Wim Swaan as "brutally massive" and intrusive in an otherwise restrained interior.{{sfn|Swaan|1984|pp=188<U+2013>196}}

====Lady Chapel and retrochoir====
Wells Cathedral has a square terminal to the choir, as is usual, and like several other cathedrals including Salisbury and [[Lichfield Cathedral|Lichfield]], has a lower Lady Chapel projecting at the eastern end, begun by Thomas Witney in about 1310, possibly before the chapter house was completed. The [[Lady Chapel]] seems to have begun as a free-standing structure in the form of an elongated octagon, but the plan changed, and it was linked to the eastern end of the building by the extension of the choir and the construction of a second transept or retrochoir east of the choir, probably by William Joy.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|pp=158<U+2013>164}}

The Lady Chapel has a vault of complex and somewhat irregular pattern, as the chapel is not symmetrical about both axes. The main ribs are intersected by additional non-supporting ribs known as "lierne ribs" and which in this case form a star-shaped pattern at the apex of the vault. It is one of the earliest lierne vaults in England.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|pp=158<U+2013>164}} There are five large windows, of which four are filled with fragments of medieval glass.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|pp=158<U+2013>164}} The tracery of the windows is in the style known as Reticulated Gothic, having a pattern of a single repeated shape, in this case a trefoil, giving a "reticulate" or net-like appearance.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|pp=158<U+2013>164}}

The retrochoir extends across the eastern end of the choir and into the eastern transepts. At its centre the vault is supported by a remarkable structure of angled piers. Two of these piers are located so as to complete the octagonal shape of the Lady Chapel, a solution described by Francis Bond as "an intuition of Genius".<!---Leave capital letter. It means the Muse of Genius.---><ref>{{cite web|title=The History and Architecture of Wells Cathedral in Somerset, Part 2|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/somerset/churches/wellscath.html|publisher=Britania|accessdate=11 July 2013}}</ref> The piers have attached shafts of marble, and, with the vaults that they support, create a vista of great complexity from every angle.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|pp=158<U+2013>164}} The windows of the retrochoir are in the Reticulated style like those of the Lady Chapel, but are fully Flowing Decorated in that the tracery mouldings form [[Ogive#Architecture|ogival]] curves.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|pp=158<U+2013>164}}

====Chapter House====
The [[chapter house]] was begun in the late 13th century and built in two stages, completed about 1310. It is a two-storeyed structure with the main chamber raised on an [[undercroft]]. It is entered from a staircase which divides and turns, one branch leading through the upper storey of [[Chain Gate, Wells|Chain Gate]] to Vicars' Close. The [[English Gothic#Geometric Decorated|Decorated]] interior is described by Alec Clifton-Taylor as "architecturally the most beautiful in England".{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|pp=156<U+2013>158}} It is octagonal, with its ribbed vault supported on a central column. The column is surrounded by shafts of [[Purbeck Marble]], rising to a single continuous rippling foliate capital of stylised oak leaves and acorns, quite different in character to the Early English stiff-leaf foliage. Above the moulding spring thirty-two ribs of strong profile giving an effect generally likened to "a great palm tree".{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|pp=156<U+2013>158}} The windows are large with Geometric Decorated tracery that is beginning to show an elongation of form, and [[ogees]] in the lesser lights that are characteristic of Flowing Decorated tracery. The tracery lights still contain ancient glass.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|pp=156<U+2013>158}} Beneath the windows are fifty-one stalls, the canopies of which are enlivened by carvings including many heads carved in a light-hearted manner.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|pp=156<U+2013>158}}

==Artworks and treasures==

===Stained glass===
Wells Cathedral contains one of the most substantial collections of medieval [[stained glass]] in England,<ref name="ayers">{{cite web |url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/review/_pdfs/09/07-ayers.pdf |title=The Medieval Stained Glass of Wells Cathedral |accessdate=11 February 2008 |format=PDF |publisher=British Academy |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071023114444/http://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/review/_pdfs/09/07-ayers.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 23 October 2007}}</ref> despite damage by Parliamentary troops in 1642 and 1643.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cathedral Church of St Andrew, Chapter House and Cloisters, Cathedral Green (east side), Wells|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=20308|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=[[Somerset County Council]]|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> The oldest surviving glass dates from the late 13th century and is in two windows on the west side of the chapter house staircase. Two windows in the south choir aisle are from 1310<U+2013>20.<ref name="ehlisting" />

The Lady Chapel has five windows of which four date from 1325<U+2013>30 and include images of a local saint, Dunstan.<ref name="ehlisting" /><ref name="ayers" /> The east window was restored to a semblance of its original appearance by [[Thomas Willement]] in 1845. The other windows have complete canopies, but the pictorial sections are fragmented.<ref name="ehlisting" />

The east window of the choir is a broad seven-light window dating from 1340<U+2013>45. It depicts the ''[[Tree of Jesse]]'' (the genealogy of Christ) and demonstrates the use of [[Silver nitrate|silver staining]], a new technique that allowed the artist to paint details on the glass in yellow, as well as black.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jesse Window |url=http://www.wellscathedral.org.uk/history/historical-highlights/the-jesse-window/ |publisher=Wells Cathedral |accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> The combination of yellow and green glass and the application of the bright yellow stain gives the window its popular name, the "Golden Window".{{sfn|Swaan|1984|p=193}} It is flanked by two windows each side in the clerestory, with large figures of saints, also dated to 1340<U+2013>45.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wells Cathedral |url=http://www.therosewindow.com/pilot/Wells/table.htm |publisher=The Medieval Stained Glass Photographic Archive |accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref> In 2010 a major conservation programme was undertaken on the Jesse Tree window.<ref name=vidimus/>

The panels in the chapel of [[Catherine of Alexandria|St Katherine]] are attributed to [[Arnold of Nijmegen]] and date from about 1520.<ref name="ehlisting" /> They were acquired from the destroyed church of Saint-Jean, [[Rouen]],<ref name="ayers" /> with the last panel having been purchased in 1953.<ref name="ehlisting" />

The large triple lancet to the nave west end was glazed at the expense of Dean Creighton at a cost of <U+00A3>140 in 1664. It was repaired in 1813, and the central light was largely replaced to a design by [[Archibald Keightley Nicholson]] between 1925 and 1931. The main north and south transept end windows by [[James Powell and Sons]] were erected in the early 20th century.<ref name="ehlisting" />

===Carvings===
The greater part of the stone carving of Wells Cathedral comprises foliate capitals in the stiff-leaf style. They are found ornamenting the piers of the nave, choir and transepts. Stiff-leaf foliage is highly abstracted, and although possibly influenced by carvings of [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaves or [[grape|vine]] leaves, cannot be easily identified as representing any particular plant.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|pp=77<U+2013>79}} At Wells, the carving of the foliage is varied and vigorous, the springing leaves and deep undercuts casting shadows that contrast with the surface of the piers.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|pp=77<U+2013>79}} In the transepts and towards the crossing in the nave the capitals have many small figurative carvings among the leaves. These include a man with a toothache and a series of four scenes depicting the "[[Epistle to the Romans|Wages of Sin]]" in a narrative of fruit stealers who creep into an orchard and are subsequently beaten by the farmer. Another well-known carving is in the north transept aisle, a foliate [[corbel]] on which climbs a lizard, sometimes identified as a [[salamander]], a symbol of [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].{{sfn|Swaan|1984|p=193}}{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|pp=77<U+2013>79}}

Carvings in the Decorated Gothic style may be found in the eastern end of the buildings, where there are many carved bosses. In the chapter house, the carvings of the fifty-one stalls include numerous small heads of great variety, many of them smiling or laughing. A well-known figure is the corbel of the dragon-slaying monk in the chapter house stair. The large continuous capital that encircles the central pillar of the chapter house is markedly different in style to the stiff-leaf of the Early English period. In contrast to the bold projections and undercutting of the earlier work, it has a rippling form and is clearly identifiable as grapevine.{{sfn|Clifton-Taylor|1967|pp=156<U+2013>157}}

The 15th-century cloisters have many small bosses ornamenting the vault. Two of these carvings in the west cloister, near the location of the gift shop and caf<U+00E9>, have been described as [[sheela na gig]]s which are female figures displaying their genitals and variously considered to be associated with depictions of the sin of [[lust]] or with ancient fertility cults.{{sfn|Warren|2005|p=58}}{{sfn|Cave|1948|p=214}}<ref>{{cite web |title=The Wells Sheela Na Gigs |url=http://www.sheelanagig.org/sheelawells.htm |publisher=The Sheela Na Gig project |accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref>

====Misericords====
Wells Cathedral has one of the finest sets of [[misericord]]s in Britain.{{sfn|Smith|1975|pp=1<U+2013>2, 25}}<ref name=EWebb/> Its clergy has a long tradition of singing or reciting from the [[Book of Psalms]] each day, along with the customary daily reading of the [[Holy Office]]. In medieval times the clergy assembled in the church eight times daily for the [[canonical hours]]. As the greater part of the services was recited while standing, many monastic or collegiate churches were fitted with stalls in which the seats tipped up to provide a convenient ledge for the monk or cleric to lean against. They were called "misericords" because their installation was an act of mercy.{{sfn|Smith|1975|pp=1<U+2013>2, 25}} Misericords typically have a carved figurative bracket beneath the ledge framed by two floral motifs known, in the [[Heraldry|heraldic]] manner, as "supporters".{{sfn|Smith|1975|pp=1<U+2013>2, 25}}

The misericords date from 1330 to 1340.{{sfn|Smith|1975|pp=1<U+2013>2, 25}} They may have been carved under the direction of master carpenter John Strode, although his name is not recorded before 1341. He was assisted by Bartholomew Quarter, who is documented from 1343.{{sfn|Smith|1975|pp=1<U+2013>2, 25}} They originally numbered ninety, of which sixty-five have survived.{{sfn|Remnant|Anderson|1969|pp=142<U+2013>144}} Sixty-one are installed in the choir, three are displayed in the cathedral and one is held by the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].{{sfn|Smith|1975|pp=1<U+2013>2, 25}} New stalls were ordered when the eastern end of the choir was extended in the early 14th century. The canons complained that they had borne the cost of the rebuilding and ordered that the prebendary clerics should pay for their own stalls.{{sfn|Smith|1975|pp=1<U+2013>2, 25}} When the newly refurbished choir opened in 1339 many misericords were left unfinished, including one fifth of the surviving sixty-five. Many of the clerics had not paid, and were required to contribute a total sum of <U+00A3>200. The misericords survived better than the other sections of the stalls, which, during the [[Protestant Reformation]], had their canopies chopped off and galleries inserted above them.{{sfn|Smith|1975|pp=1<U+2013>2, 25}} One of the misericords, depicting a boy pulling a thorn from his foot, dates from the 17th century.<ref name=EWebb/> In 1848 there was a complete rearrangement of the choir furniture, and sixty-one of the misericords were reused in the restructured stalls.{{sfn|Smith|1975|pp=1<U+2013>2, 25}}

The subject matter of the carvings of the central brackets on misericords is very varied, but with many common themes occurring in different churches. Typically, the themes are less unified and less directly related to the Bible and Christian theology than are the themes of small sculptures seen elsewhere within churches, such as those on bosses. This is much the case at Wells, where none of the misericord carvings is directly based on a Biblical story.<ref name=EWebb>{{cite web|last=Webb|first=Eric|title=The Misericords of Wells Cathedral|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/drericwebb/docs/wells/wells-key-ill.htm|publisher=Eric Webb|accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> The subjects, chosen either by the wood-carver, or perhaps by the individual paying for the stall, have no over-riding theme. The sole unifying element is the [[roundel]]s on each side of the pictorial subject, which are all elaborately carved foliage, in most cases formal and stylised in the later Decorated manner, but with several examples of naturalistic foliage including roses and [[Convolvulus|bindweed]].{{sfn|Smith|1975|pp=1<U+2013>2, 25}}<ref name=EWebb/> Many of the subjects carry traditional interpretations. The image of the "[[Pelican#Mythology and popular culture|Pelican in her Piety]]" (believed to feed her young on her own blood) is a recognised symbol for Christ's love for the Church.<!---Leave caps.---> A cat playing with a mouse may represent the [[Devil]] snaring a human soul.<ref name=EWebb/> Other subjects illustrate popular fables or sayings such as "When the fox preaches, look to your geese".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/archives/blog/?p=634 |title=When the fox preaches&nbsp;... |work=College of St George Archives|publisher=Dean & Canons of Windsor|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> Many of the subjects are depictions of animals, some of which may symbolise a human vice or virtue, or an aspect of faith.<ref name=EWebb/>

Twenty-seven of the carvings depict animals: rabbits, dogs, a puppy biting a cat, a ewe feeding a lamb, monkeys, lions, bats, and the [[Early Christian art|early Christian]] motif of two doves drinking from a [[ewer]]. Eighteen of the misericords have mythological subjects, including mermaids, dragons and [[wyvern]]s. Five of the carvings are clearly narrative, such as the Fox and the Geese, and the story of [[Alexander the Great]] being raised to Heaven by [[griffin]]s. There are three heads: a bishop in a mitre, an angel and a woman wearing a veil over her hair arranged in coils over each ear. Eleven carvings are of human figures, among which are several of remarkable design, having been conceived by the artist specifically for their purpose of supporting a shelf. One figure lies beneath the seat, supporting the shelf with his cheek, one hand and one foot. Another sits in a contorted manner supporting the weight on his elbow, while another figure squats with his knees wide apart and a strained look on his face.{{sfn|Smith|1975|pp=1<U+2013>2, 25}}

===Fittings and monuments===
Some of the cathedral's fittings and monuments are hundreds of years old. The [[brass]] lectern in the Lady Chapel dates from 1661, and has a moulded stand and foliate crest.<ref name=reeve>{{cite journal|last=Reeve|first=Matthew M.|title=The Capital Sculpture of Wells Cathedral : Masons, Patrons and the Margins of English Gothic Architecture|journal=Journal of the British Archaeological Association|year=2010|volume=163|pages=72<U+2013>109|doi=10.1179/174767010x12747977921047|url=http://www.academia.edu/1272708/The_Capital_Sculpture_of_Wells_Cathedral_Masons_Patrons_and_the_Margins_of_English_Gothic_Architecture|ref=harv}}</ref> In the north transept chapel is a 17th-century oak screen with columns, formerly part of cow stalls, with artisan [[Ionic order|Ionic]] capitals and cornice, which is set forward over the chest tomb of [[John Godelee]]. There is a bound oak chest from the 14th century which was used to store the chapter seal and key documents. The Bishop's Throne dates from 1340, and has a panelled, canted front and stone doorway, and a deep nodding cusped ogee canopy above it, with three-stepped [[Niche (architecture)|statue niches]] and pinnacles. The throne was restored by Anthony Salvin around 1850.<ref name=ehlisting /> Opposite the throne is a 19th-century octagonal pulpit on a coved base with panelled sides, and steps up from the north aisle. The round font in the south transept is from the former [[Anglo-Saxon England|Saxon]] cathedral and has an arcade of round-headed arches, on a round [[plinth]].

===Clock===
In the north transept is [[Wells Cathedral clock]], an [[astronomical clock]] from about 1325, believed to be the work of Peter Lightfoot, a monk of Glastonbury.{{sfn|Cox|2008|p=183}} Its mechanism, dated to between 1386 and 1392, was replaced in the 19th century, and the original mechanism moved to the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] in London, where it continues to operate. It is the second-oldest surviving clock in England, after the [[Salisbury cathedral clock]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/time_measurement/1884-77.aspx |title=Wells Cathedral clock, c.1392 |accessdate=11 February 2008 |publisher=Science Museum }}</ref>

The clock has its original medieval face. As well as showing the time on a 24-hour dial, it reflects the motion of the Sun and Moon, the [[Lunar phase|phases of the Moon]], and the time since the last new Moon. The astronomical dial represents a [[Geocentric model|geocentric]] or pre-[[Copernican Revolution|Copernican]] view of the universe, with the Sun and Moon revolving round a central fixed Earth, like that of the clock at [[Ottery St Mary]].<ref name=isleofavalon/> Every quarter hour the clock is chimed by a quarter jack in the form of a small [[automaton]] known as Jack Blandifers, who hits two bells with hammers and two with his heels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.horologica.co.uk/horology/Wells.html |publisher=Horologica|title=World's oldest clock? Doubtful|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> At the striking of the clock [[jousting]] knights appear above the clock face.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Clock|url=http://www.wellscathedral.org.uk/history/historical-highlights/the-clock/|publisher=Wells Cathedral|accessdate=22 February 2014}}</ref> 

On the outer wall of the transept, opposite Vicars' Hall, is a second clock face of the same clock, placed there just over seventy years after the interior clock and driven by the same mechanism. The second clock face has two quarter jacks (which strike on the quarter hour) in the form of knights in armour.{{sfn|Bedford|2007|p=23}}

In 2010 the official clock-winder retired and was replaced by an electric mechanism.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/7953673/Worlds-oldest-mechanical-clock-to-be-wound-by-hand-for-last-time.html |title=World's oldest mechanical clock 'to be wound by hand for last time' |accessdate=21 August 2010 |publisher=''Daily Telegraph'' | location=London | first=Andrew | last=Hough | date=20 August 2010}}</ref>

===Organ and organists===
The first record of an organ at this church dates from 1310, and a smaller organ, probably for the Lady Chapel, was installed in 1415. In 1620 an organ, built by [[Thomas Dallam]], was installed at a cost of <U+00A3>398 1s 5d.(equivalent to about <U+00A3>75,000  as of 2012{{efn|name=GDP|The method of calculation used is the historic opportunity cost of a project measured by comparing its relative cost using the cost index of all output in the economy. This measure uses the [[GDP deflator]].<ref name=MeasuringWorth1>{{cite web |last=Officer |first=Lawrence H. |contribution=Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1830 to Present |url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/ |publisher=measuringworth.com |accessdate=1 January 2014 |ref=harv |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The organ that was installed in 1620 was destroyed by parliamentary soldiers in 1643. An organ built in 1662 was enlarged in 1786 and again in 1855.<ref name=npor>{{cite web |url=http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=N06889 |title=Somerset, Wells Cathedral of St. Andrew, Dean & Chapter of Wells N0 6890|accessdate=11 February 2008 |publisher=National Pipe Organ Register (NPOR) }}</ref> In 1909<U+2013>1910 an organ was built by [[Harrison & Harrison]] of Durham with the best parts of the old organ retained, and it has been maintained by the same company since.<ref name=npor/>

The first recorded [[List of organists and assistant organists of Wells Cathedral|organist of Wells Cathedral]] was Walter Bagele (or Vageler) in 1416,<ref>{{cite web|title=Walter Bagele|url=http://www.organ-biography.info/index.php?id=Bagele_Walter_15|publisher=Biographical Dictionary of the Organ|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> and the post of organist or assistant organist has been held by more than 60 individuals since then. Between 1996 and 2004 the appointed [[Organist and Master of the Choristers]] was [[Malcolm Archer]]. Since 2005 the organist has been Matthew Owens.<ref>{{cite web|title=Matthew Owens|url=http://wcos.org.uk/about-us/matthew-owens|publisher=Wells Cathedral Oratorio Society|accessdate=15 February 2014}}</ref> Jonathan Vaughn was appointed assistant organist in 2007, and the current organ scholars are Owain Park and William Fox.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wellscathedral.org.uk/music-the-choir/ |title=Music |publisher=Wells Cathedral |date= |accessdate=3 January 2013}}</ref>

===Cathedral Choir===
There has been a choir of boy choristers at Wells since 909. Currently there are eighteen boy choristers aged from eight to fourteen years.<ref name=choir/> The Vicars Choral was formed in the 12th century and the sung liturgy was provided by a traditional cathedral choir of men and boys, until the formation of an additional choir of girls in 1994. The boys and girls sing alternately with the Vicars Choral, and are educated at Wells Cathedral School.<ref>{{cite web |title=Choristers |url=http://www.wellscathedral.org.uk/music-the-choir/choristers/ |publisher=Wells Cathedral |accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>
The Vicars Choral currently number twelve men, of whom three are choral scholars. Since 1348 the College of Vicars has had its own accommodation. The Vicars Choral generally perform with the choristers, except on Wednesdays, when they sing alone, enabling them to present a different repertoire.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wellscathedral.org.uk/music-the-choir/the-vicars-choral/ |title=The Vicars Choral |publisher=Wells Cathedral |accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>

In December 2010 Wells Cathedral Choir was rated by ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' magazine as "the highest ranking choir with children in the world",<ref name=choir>{{cite web|url=http://www.wellscathedral.org.uk/music-the-choir/music-and-the-choir/ |title=Wells Cathedral Choir|publisher=Wells Cathedral | accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref> and continues to provide music for the liturgy at Sunday and weekday services. The choir has made many recordings and toured frequently, including performances in Beijing and Hong Kong in 2012. Its repertoire ranges from the choral music of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] to recently commissioned works.<ref name=choir/>

===Voluntary Choir===
The Wells Cathedral Voluntary Choir is a mixed adult choir of thirty members. It was formed in 1986 to sing at the midnight service on Christmas Eve, and was invited to sing at several other special services.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wells Cathedral Voluntary Choir|url=http://www.wellscathedral.org.uk/music-the-choir/wells-cathedral-voluntary-choir/|publisher=Wells Cathedral|accessdate=4 January 2014}}</ref> The choir now sings about fifty services a year when the Cathedral Choir is in recess or on tour, and spends one week a year singing as the "choir in residence" at another cathedral. Although primarily liturgical, the choir's repertoire also includes other forms of music as well as performances at engagements such as weddings and funerals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wellscathedral.org.uk/music-the-choir/wells-cathedral-voluntary-choir/ |title=The Wells Cathedral Voluntary Choir |publisher=Wells Cathedral |accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>

==Library==

The library is above the eastern cloister, and was built between 1430 and 1508.{{sfn|Harvey|1987|p=163}} The library's collection is in three parts: early documents, housed in the [[Muniment]] Room; the collection predating 1800, housed in the Chained Library; and the post-1800 collection, housed in the Reading Room.<ref name="library"/> The chapter's earlier collection was destroyed during the Reformation, so the present library consists chiefly of early printed books, rather than medieval manuscripts.<ref name="library"/> The earlier books, in the Chained Library, number 2,800 volumes and give an indication of the variety of interests of the members of the cathedral chapter from the Reformation until 1800. The focus of the collection is predominantly theology but there are volumes on science, medicine, exploration, and languages. Books of particular interest include [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny's]] ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' printed in 1472, an ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum|Atlas of the World]]'' by [[Abraham Ortelius]], printed in 1606 and a set of the works of [[Aristotle]] that once belonged to [[Erasmus]].<ref name="library">{{cite web | url=http://www.wellscathedral.org.uk/history/library-archives/ | publisher=Wells Cathedral | title=Library & Archives | accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref> The library is open to the public at appointed times during summer and has a small exhibition of documents and books.<ref name="library"/>

===Original records===
Three early registers of the dean and chapter of Wells&nbsp;<U+2013> the ''Liber Albus I'' (White Book; R I), ''Liber Albus II'' (R III) and ''Liber Ruber'' (Red Book; R II, section i)&nbsp;<U+2013> were edited by W.

The cathedral is situated adjacent to a large lawned area, Cathedral Green, which is approached by three ancient gateways, [[Brown's Gatehouse, Wells|Brown's Gatehouse]], [[Penniless Porch, Wells|Penniless Porch]] and Chain Gate.  On Cathedral Green is the 12th-century [[The Old Deanery, Wells|Old Deanery]], largely rebuilt in the late 15th century by Dean Gunthorpe and remodelled by Dean Bathurst in the late 17th century. It is no longer the residence of the dean, and instead serves as offices for the diocese.<ref name="IoE">{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=483309 |title= The Old Deanery, Wells|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=13 January 2009}}</ref>

To the south of the cathedral is the moated Bishop's Palace, begun around 1210 by Bishop Jocelin of Wells but dating mostly from the 1230s. In the 15th century Bishop Beckington added the north wing, which is now the bishop's residence.<ref name="ioe">{{cite web | title=The Bishop's Palace and Bishop's House | work=Images of England | publisher=English Heritage | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=483259 | accessdate=10 November 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.picturesofengland.com/England/Somerset/Wells/Bishop's_Palace,_Wells |title=Pictures of Bishop's Palace, Wells |accessdate=10 November 2007 |work=Pictures of England }}</ref> It was restored and extended by Benjamin Ferrey between 1846 and 1854.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Bishop's Palace and Bishop's House |url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1382873|work=National Heritage list for England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref>

To the north of the cathedral and connected to it by the Chain Gate is Vicars' Close, a street planned in the 14th century and claimed to be the oldest purely residential street in Europe with all but one of its original buildings surviving intact.{{sfn|Leete-Hodge|1985|p=20}}{{sfn|Leete-Hodge|1985|p=29}} Buildings in Vicars' Close include the Vicars Hall and gateway at the south end, and the Vicars Chapel and Library at the north end.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Vicars' Chapel|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1383201|work=National Heritage List for England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=22 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Vicars' Hall including number 28, Vicars' Close|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1383202|work=National Heritage List for England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=22 February 2014}}</ref>
