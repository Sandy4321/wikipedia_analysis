'''Parson's Lodge Battery''' is a coastal [[Artillery battery|battery]] and [[fortification|fort]] in the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]].

==History==
The [[Moors]] had been in Gibraltar, and the [[Spain|Spanish]] had occupied [[Rock of Gibraltar|The Rock]] for over 250 years. In 1704, the British [[Capture of Gibraltar|took possession]] and, by 1720, they had installed their own guns at this point. There were a pair of eighteen pounders and another pair of twelve pounders. By 1744, there were over 20 guns around [[Rosia Bay]]. Parson's Lodge Battery was originally named the 9th Rosia Battery. Its name was first recorded in 1761 and is reputedly in honour of a church and hermitage named St. John the Green.<ref name=pl/>

In early October 1840, [[John Thomas Jones|Major-General John Thomas Jones]] arrived to inspect the defences of Gibraltar. He remained on the rock until June 1841, when he returned to [[England]].<ref name="dnb">{{cite web  | last =Vetch | first =R.

At the height of its military importance, it had three [[RML 10 inch 18 ton gun|18 ton rifled muzzle-loading guns]] which guarded the approaches to Rosia Bay, which is the only [[natural harbour]] on The Rock. The guns were installed in 1884.<ref name=finfa>{{cite book|last=Finlayson|first=Clive|title=The Fortifications of Gibraltar 1068-1945 - Page 34|year=2006|publisher=Gibraltar Museum|pages=64|url=http://books.google.com/?id=BC5QBR0oB04C&dq=Parson%27s+Lodge+Battery|display-authors=1|isbn=9781846030161}}</ref> These guns fired a 400 pound shell over two and a half miles. The guns were hidden behind an invention made from iron and [[teak]] known as the [[Gibraltar Shield]].<ref name=pl/> These shields were made from thick layers of iron around thick teak planks. The shields later included bolts that were also protected against abnormal loads as they included wooden bushes and had corners filed away to prevent them being snapped when resisting an enemy's shell.<ref>[http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/13171456 Iron Land Defences], Sydney Morning Herald, 21 August 1868, accessed August 2012</ref>

Beneath the fort lies a narrow tunnel that was at one time used by a one [[metre gauge]] railway but is now a road tunnel.<ref name=ehlen/> The tunnel was one of two originally created to take large quantities of quarried stone from [[Camp Bay, Gibraltar|Camp Bay]] to the [[Gibraltar Harbour|harbour's]] [[South Mole, Gibraltar Harbour|South Mole]] when it was constructed in the 1880s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Issues in Environmental Geology: A British Perspective|year=1998|publisher=Geological Society|isbn=1862390142, 9781862390140|pages=438|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DoUYEPemXF0C&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq=Issues+in+Environmental+Geology:+A+British+Perspective&source=bl&ots=rZ8MHYodW5&sig=hotSrB5glOLoMYpzaHCIsiBbBME&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VGcvULvLHZGByAG3oYCoBg&ved=0CFMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Issues%20in%20Environmental%20Geology%3A%20A%20British%20Perspective&f=false|edition=illustrated|editor=Matthew R.

==World Wars==
The battery was used during both [[World Wars]] and, in 1941, it had anti-aircraft and anti-tank guns as well as anti-aircraft searchlights installed.<ref name=pl/> The battery was abandoned in the 1950s<ref name=ehlen>{{cite book|last=Ehlen|first=Julie|title=The Environmental Legacy of Military Operations p.105 & 108|year=2001|pages=228|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kbpS12tpG3AC&dq=Parson%27s+Lodge+Battery&q=Parson%27s+Lodge+Battery#v=snippet&q=Parson%27s%20Lodge%20Battery&f=false}}</ref>  and extensively restored in 1994 by the [[Gibraltar Heritage Trust]]. The grounds also include a field centre which is used by [[Gibraltar Museum]].

There is a wall that goes from Parson's Lodge Battery to [[Buena Vista Barracks]]. This wall and the Machicouli Gallery above Camp Bay are both List A items and are protected by the [[Gibraltar Heritage Trust Act]] that transferred these and many other assets to the Gibraltar Heritage Trust in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gibraltar Heritage Trust Act 1989|url=http://www.gibraltarlaws.gov.gi/articles/1989-12o.pdf|work=gibraltarlaws.gov.gi|publisher=Gibraltar Heritage Trust|accessdate=18 August 2012}}</ref>
