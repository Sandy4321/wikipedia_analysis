'''Selina Meyer''' is a fictional [[Vice President of the United States]] portrayed by [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] on the [[HBO]] television comedy series ''[[Veep (TV series)|Veep]]''. Louis-Dreyfus has been critically acclaimed for this role, earning two [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series]] awards and two [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress <U+2013> Television Series Musical or Comedy]] nominations.

Meyer is a former [[United States Senator]]. During the first season of the show as Vice President she was powerless and disregarded by most other important officials leading to various types of humiliation and indignities. During the second season she began to amass some power and influence. In the upcoming season 3, she is a presidential candidate.

The role garnered Louis-Dreyfus milestone awards. Her 14th [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for a role in the regular cast of a comedy surpassed [[Lucille Ball]] as the most ever. Her Primetime Emmy Award for her 3rd different regular cast role also was a record-setting achievement for comedy actress.

T. A. Frank of ''[[The New Republic]]'' says that in season 1 she is completely ignored by the president, dismissed by Congress as she endures repeated indignities with a high degree of cynicism.
