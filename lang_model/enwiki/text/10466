'''Mesopotamian religion''' refers to the [[religion|religious beliefs and practices]] followed by the [[Sumer]]ian and [[Akkadian]] ([[Assyrian people|Assyrian]]/[[Babylonian]]) peoples living in [[Mesopotamia]] (around the area of modern [[Iraq]]) that dominated the region for a period of 4200 years from the fourth millennium BC to approximately the 3rd century AD.<ref name="Bottero 2001:Preface">Bottero (2001:Preface)</ref> [[Christianity]] began to take root among the Mesopotamians in the 1st century AD, and over the next 300 years the native religion largely died out. However, it is known that the god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] was still worshipped in [[Assyria]] as late as the 4th Century AD and it is rumoured that [[Ashurism]] was still practiced by tiny minorities in northern Assyria (around [[Harran]]) until the 17th Century AD. Commonly thought of as a form of [[paganism]], Mesopotamian religion was [[polytheism|polytheistic]], worshipping over two thousand different deities,<ref name="Bottero 2001:45">Bottero (2001:45)</ref> many of which were associated with a specific city or state within Mesopotamia such as [[Sumer]], [[Akkad]], [[Assyria]], [[Assur]], [[Nineveh]], [[Ur]], [[Uruk]], [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] and [[Babylon]]. Some of the most significant of these deities were [[Anu]], [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]],  [[Enlil]], [[Ishtar]] ([[Astarte]]), [[Ashur]], [[Shamash]], [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Adad]]/[[Hadad]], [[Sin_(mythology)|Sin (Nanna)]], [[Dagan]], [[Ninurta]], [[Nisroch]], [[Nergal]], [[Tiamat]], [[Bel (god)|Bel]] and [[Marduk]].
Some, such as the historian Jean Bottero, have made the claim that Mesopotamian religion is the worlds [[oldest religion|oldest faith]],<ref name="Bottero 2001:Preface"/> although there are several other claims to that title. Although as writing was invented in Mesopotamia, it is certainly the oldest faith in written history. What we know about Mesopotamian religion comes from [[archaeology|archaeological evidence]] uncovered in the region, particularly literary sources, which are usually written in [[cuneiform]] on clay tablets and which describe both mythology and cultic practices. However, other artifacts can also be used as the Mesopotamians' "entire existence was infused by their religiosity, just about everything they have passed on to us can be used a source of knowledge about their religion."<ref>Bottero (2001:21<U+2013>22)</ref>

Although it mostly died out 1600 to 1700 years ago, Mesopotamian religion has still had an influence on the modern world, predominantly because much [[Biblical mythology]] that is today found in [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Mandeanism]] shares some overlapping consistency with much older ancient Mesopotamian myths, in particular the [[Creation Myth]], the [[Garden of Eden]], [[The Great Flood]], [[Tower of Babel]] and mythical Biblical characters such as [[Nimrod]] and [[Lilith]] (the Assyrian [[Lilitu]]). In addition the story of [[Moses]]' origins shares a striking similarity with that of [[Sargon of Akkad]], and the [[Ten Commandments]] mirror older Assyrian-Babylonian legal codes to some degree.  It has also inspired various contemporary [[Neopagan]] groups to begin worshipping the Mesopotamian deities once more, albeit in a way often different from that of the Mesopotamian peoples.

==History==
[[Image:Mesopotamia.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Overview map of ancient Mesopotamia.]]
The peoples of Mesopotamia originally consisted of two peoples, the [[Semitic]] [[Akkadians]] (later to be known as [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Babylonians]]) and the [[Sumerians]]. These peoples were not originally one united nation, but members of various different city-states. In the fourth millennium BCE, when the first evidence for what is recognisably Mesopotamian religion can be seen with the invention in Mesopotamia of writing circa 3500 BCE, the [[Sumerians]] appeared, although it is not known if they migrated into the area in pre historic times or whether they were some of the original inhabitants. They settled in southern Mesopotamia, which became known as [[Sumer]], and had an awesome influence over the Semitic Akkadian peoples and their culture. The Sumerians were incredibly advanced, as well as inventing Writing, they also invented Mathematics, [[Wheeled Vehicles]], Astronomy, Astrology, The Calendar and created the first City States/Nations such as [[Uruk]], [[Ur]], [[Lagash]], [[Isin]], [[Umma]] and [[Larsa]]. In the north, in an area known as [[Akkad]], a civilisation known as the [[Akkadians]] arose, who spoke a [[semitic language]] that was distinct from that of the Sumerians who spoke a [[language isolate]].<ref>Bottero (2001:7<U+2013>9)</ref>

Gradually there was increasing syncreticism between the Sumerian and Akkadian cultures and deities, with the Akkadians typically preferring to worship fewer deities, but elevating them to greater positions of power. In circa 2300 BCE the Akkadian king [[Sargon the Great]] conquered all of Mesopotamia, uniting the Akkadian and Sumerians in the worlds first empire, though this Akkadian empire collapsed after two centuries. The empire broke up into two Akkadian states, [[Assyria]] in the north, and [[Babylon]] in the south. Some time after this the Sumerians disappeared, becoming wholly absorbed into the Assyrio-Babylonian population. In around 1800 BCE, the king of [[Babylon]], King [[Hammurabi]], conquered much of Mesopotamia, but this Babylonian empire collapsed a century later due to attacks from mountain-dwelling people known as the [[Kassites]] from Asia Minor. [[Assyria]] became a major power from the 14th Century BC after throwing off the influence of the [[Hittites]] and [[Mitanni]], and the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] was probably the most dominant power on earth between the 10th Century BC and the 7th Century BC, with an empire stretching from Cyprus in the west to central Iran in the east, and from the Caucasus mountains in the north to Nubia and Arabia in the south, facilitating the spread of Mesopotamian culture and religion far and wide under emperors such as [[Ashurbanipal]], [[Tukulti-Ninurta II|Tukulti-Ninurta]], [[Tiglath-Pileser III|Tiglath-Pileser]], [[Sargon II]], [[Sennacherib]] and [[Esarhaddon]]. The empire fell in 608 BC with the death of [[Ashur-uballit II]] after a period of internal strife followed by an attack by a coalition of [[Babylonians]], [[Medes]], [[Scythians]], [[Persia]]ns and [[Cimmerians]]led by [[Nabopolassar]] of Babylon. During the Neo Assyrian Empire [[Aramaic]] became the lingua franca of the empire, and also Mesopotamia proper. The last written records in Akkadian were [[Astrological]] [[Literature|Texts]] dating from 78 AD discovered in Assyria.

===Neo-Assyrian Empire===
The religion of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], 911 BC-608 BC, sometimes called '''Ashurism''' by [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] today, centered around the god [[Ashur (god)|Assur]], patron deity of the city of [[Assur]], besides [[Ishtar]] patroness of [[Nineveh]]. The [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] adopted [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Rite]] [[Christianity]] during the course of the 1st to the 4th centuries AD (which they still retain) and the religion died out, although there is some evidence to suggest that it survived in isolated pockets well into the late Middle Ages in northern Mesopotamia/Assyria, particularly around [[Harran]].

Assyrian religion was an evolution of the ancient polytheistic Sumerian and Akkadian religions into [[henotheism]], a religion based on the worship of one supreme god, but recognizing the existence of others. This was represented through the gradual takeover by Ashur of the roles of other gods, and this process runs parallel with the expansionist policies of the Assyrian Empire.<ref name="Bertman117">{{Cite book|last=Bertman|first=Stephen|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=New York|publisher=Oxford UP|year=2005|pages=117}}</ref> As the Assyrians extended their domain over other lands, they considered it important that the local peoples acknowledge the Assyrian king as the king of their lands as well. However, kingship at the time was linked very closely with the idea of divine mandate.<ref name="Bertman66">{{Cite book|last=Bertman|first=Stephen|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=New York|publisher=Oxford UP|year=2005|pages=66}}</ref> The Assyrian king, whilst not being a god himself, was acknowledged as the chief servant of the chief god, Ashur. In this manner, the king's authority was seen as absolute so long as the high priest reassured the peoples that the gods, or in the case of the henotheistic Assyrians, ''the God'', was pleased with the current ruler.<ref name="Bertman66"/> For the Assyrians who lived in Assur and the surrounding lands, this system was the norm. For the conquered peoples, however, it was novel, particularly to the people of smaller city-states. In time, Assur was promoted from being the local deity of Assur to the overlord of the vast Assyrian domain,<ref name="Bertman66"/> with worship being conducted in his name throughout the lands of the Assyrians. With the worship of Assur across much of the [[Fertile Crescent]], the Assyrian king could command the loyalty of his fellow servants of Assur.

[[Ashur (god)|Ashur]], the patron deity of the city of Assur from the Late Bronze Age, was in constant rivalry with the patron deity of [[Babylon]], [[Marduk]].  In Assyria, Ashur eventually superseded Marduk even in his role as the husband of Ishtar.

===Later history===
Babylon had a brief late flowering of power and influence under the [[Chaldean Dynasty]] which took over much of the empire formerly held by their northern kinsmen. However, the last king of Babylon, the Assyrian born [[Nabonidus]], paid little attention to politics, preferring to obsess with worship of the moon god [[Sin]], leaving day to day rule to his son [[Belshazzar]]. This and the fact that the Persians and Medes to the east were growing in power now that the might of Assyria that had held them in vassalage for centuries was gone, spelt the death knell for native Mesopotamian power.

In 500 BCE, Mesopotamia was invaded by the [[Persian empire]], then ruled by [[Cyrus the Great]]. This brought to an end over 3000 years of Mesopotamian dominance of the near east. The Persians maintained and did not interfere in the native culture and religion and Assyria and Babylon continued to exist as entities, and Assyria was strong enough to launch a major rebellion against Persia in 482 BCE. Then, two centuries later in 330 BC the [[Greece|Greek]] emperor [[Alexander the Great]] overthrew the Persians and took control of Mesopotamia itself, bringing [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic]] influence to the region with the [[Seleucid Empire]].<ref>Bottero (2001:17<U+2013>18)</ref> Assyria and Babylonia later became provinces under the consecutive empires of [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]] (province of [[Persian_Babylonia|Babylonia]]), [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] (province of [[Assyria (Roman province)|Assyria]]) and [[Sassanid]] [[Persia]] (province of [[Asuristan]]). 

[[Christianity]] began to take hold in the 1st Century AD and the independent '''Neo Assyrian''' states of [[Adiabene]], [[Osroene]] and [[Hatra]] as well as the [[Syriac]] kingdom of [[Palmyra]], were largely ruled by converts to Christianity and [[Judaism]] ([[Gnosticism]] also became popular), though native religions still existed among the populace, gods such as [[Ashur]] and [[Sin]] were still worshipped at least until the 4th century AD. There is some evidence to suggest [[Ashurism]] was still practiced around [[Harran]] as late as the 17th Century by tiny minorities of Assyrians. In the 3rd century AD another native Mesopotamian religion flourished, namely [[Manicheanism]], which incorporated elements of Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, and Zoroastrianism, as well as local Mesopotamian elements<ref>Widengren, Geo ''Mesopotamian elements in Manichaeism (King and Saviour II): Studies in Manichaean, Mandaean, and Syrian-gnostic religion'', Lundequistska bokhandeln, 1946.</ref>. At one time it rivalled Christianity and the [[Zoroastrian]] religion of Persia, however it was driven out of existence by Persian and later Arab Islamic persecutions.

Throughout this entire period both Assyria and Babylonia continued to exist as geo political entities and named regions, and Assyria in particular became a center of a distinctly [[Church of the East|Mesopotamian Christianity]], namely the ancient [[Eastern Syrian Rite]] [[Christianity]] which was spread all over the near east and as far away as central Asia, India, Mongolia and China by travelling monks and still exists as the religion of the Assyrians to this day. Various [[Gnostic]] sects also sprang up such as [[Sabianism]] and [[Mandeanism]] the latter of which also still exists. After the [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] invasion and conquest in the 7th Century AD, both Assyria and Babylonia were dissolved. Over the next few centuries Mesopotamia saw an influx of [[Arabs]], [[Kurds]] and later [[Turkic peoples]], and people retaining native ethnicity, culture, customs and language gradually became a minority. This process was completed by the massacres of native Mesopotamians by [[Tamurlane]] in the 14th Century. However the [[Neo Aramaic]] dialects still survive to this day among the 5% of Mesopotamians who resisted "Arabization" and "Islamification". These people exist today as the modern [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] who are wholly [[East Syrian Rite|Eastern Rite]] [[Christian]] but retain a distinct Mesopotamian language, [[Neo Aramaic]] (which descends from the Aramaic first spoken in Mesopotamia in 1200 BCE and still retains hundreds of Akkadian loan words) and identity and the naming of children with ancient names such as [[Ashur]], [[Shamash]], [[Semiramis]], [[Lamassu]], [[Ninus]], [[Lilitu]]/[[Lilith]], [[Sargon]], [[Hadad]] etc. is still common. Likewise months may be named after ancient deities in the Assyrian Calendar, i.e. [[Tammuz]]. The modern [[Assyrian calendar]] is dated back to the traditional founding and dedicating of the city of [[Ashur]] to the god of the same name.

==Mythology==
There are no specific written records explaining Mesopotamian religious [[cosmology]] that survive to us today. Nonetheless, modern scholars have examined various accounts, and created what is believed to be an at least partially accurate depiction of Mesopotamian cosmology.<ref>Bottero (2001:77<U+2013>78)</ref> In the ''Epic of Creation'', dated to 1200 BCE, it explains that the god [[Marduk]] killed the mother goddess [[Tiamat]] and used half her body to create the earth, and the other half to create both the paradise of ''<U+0161>am<U+00FB>'' and the netherworld of ''ir<U+1E63>itu''.<ref>Bottero (2001:79)</ref> A document from a similar period stated that the universe was a spheroid, with three levels of ''<U+0161>am<U+00FB>'', where the gods dwelt, and where the stars existed, above the three levels of earth below it.<ref>Bottero (2001:80)</ref>

===Deities===
[[File:Ishtar vase Louvre AO17000-detail.jpg|thumb|150px|Inanna/Ishtar depicted on the "Ishtar vase", Larsa, early 2. millennium BCE, [[Louvre]] AO 6501]]
Mesopotamian religion was [[polytheism|polytheistic]], thereby accepting the existence of many different deities, both male and female, though it was also [[henotheism|henotheistic]],<ref>Bottero (2001:41)</ref> with certain gods being viewed as superior to others by their specific devotees. These devotees were often from a particular city or city-state that held that deity as its [[patron|patron deity]], for instance the god [[Enki]] was often associated with the city of [[Eridu]], and the god [[Marduk]] was associated with [[Babylon]].<ref>Bottero (2001:53)</ref> Whilst the full number of gods and goddesses found in Mesopotamia is not known, K. Tallqvist, in his ''Akkadische G<U+00F6>tterepitheta'' (1938) counted around two thousand four hundred that we now know about, most of which had Sumerian names. In the [[Sumerian language]], the gods were referred to as ''dingir'', whilst in the [[Akkadian language]] they were known as ''ilu'' and it seems that there was syncreticism between the gods worshipped by the two groups, adopting one another's deities.<ref name="Bottero 2001:45"/>

The Mesopotamian gods bore many similarities with humans, and were [[anthropomorphic]], thereby having humanoid form. Similarly, they often acted like humans, requiring food and drink, as well as drinking [[alcohol]] and subsequently suffering the effects of [[drunkenness]].<ref>Bottero (2001:64<U+2013>66)</ref> In many cases, the various deities were family relations of one another, a trait found in many other polytheistic religions.<ref>Bottero (2001:50)</ref> The historian J. Bott<U+00E9>ro was of the opinion that the gods were not viewed [[mysticism|mystically]], but were instead seen as high-up masters who had to be obeyed and feared, as opposed to loved and adored.<ref name="Bottero 2001:37">Bottero (2001:37)</ref> Nonetheless, many Mesopotamians, of all classes, had names that were devoted to a certain deity; this practice appeared to have begun in the third millennium BCE amongst the Sumerians, but also was later adopted by the Akkadians as well.<ref>Bottero (2001:39)</ref>

Initially, the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of deities was not ordered, but later Mesopotamian theologians came up with the concept of ranking the deities in order of importance. A Sumerian list of around 560 deities that did this was uncovered at F<U+00E2>ra and Tell Ab<U+00FB> <U+1E62>al<U+0101>b<U+012B>kh and dated to circa 2600 BCE, ranking five primary deities as being of particular importance.<ref>Bottero (2001:48<U+2013>49)</ref> One of the most important of these early Mesopotamian deities was the god [[Enlil]], who was originally a Sumerian divinity viewed as a king of the gods and a controller of the world, who was later adopted by the Akkadians. Another was the Sumerian god [[Ea]], who served a similar role to [[Enlil]] and became known as [[Anu]] amongst the Akkadians. The Sumerian god [[Enki]] was later also adopted by the Akkadians, initially under his original name, and later as [[<U+00C9>a]]. Similarly the Sumerian moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]] became the Akkadian S<U+00EE>n whilst the Sumerian sun god [[Utu]] became the Akkadian [[Shamash]]. One of the most notable goddesses was the Sumerian love deity [[Inanna]], who was later equated with the Akkadian [[Ishtar]]. With the later rise to power of the [[Babylonians]] in the 18th century BCE, the king, [[Hammurabi]], declared [[Marduk]], a deity who before then had not been of significant importance, to a position of supremacy alongside Anu and Enlil.<ref>Bottero (2001:54)</ref>

In Assyria, in the north of Mesopotamia, the supreme god was [[Ashur]]. The following is a list of some '''Assyrian deities''':
*[[Ashur]]/[[Ashur (god)|Assur]] ({{lang-arc|<U+0710><U+0735><U+072B><U+073F><U+0718><U+072A>}}) / [[Anshar]], patron of [[Assur]]

<ref>http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/</ref>

==Legend==
Perhaps the most significant legend to survive from Mesopotamian religion is the Epic of Gilgamesh, which tells the story of the heroic king Gilgamesh and his wild friend Enkidu, and the former's search for immortality which is entwined with all the gods and their approval. There are no known Mesopotamian tales about the [[End Time|end of the world]], although it has been speculated that they believed that this would eventually occur. This is largely because [[Berossus]] wrote that the Mesopotamians believed the world to last "twelve times twelve ''sars''"; with a ''sar'' being 3,600 years, this would indicate that at least some of the Mesopotamians believed that the Earth would only last 518,400 years.<ref>Bottero (2001:95)</ref>

===Afterlife===
The ancient Mesopotamians believed in an [[afterlife]] that was a land below our world. It was this land, known alternately as ''Arall<U+00FB>'', ''Ganzer'' or ''Irkallu'', the latter of which meant "Great Below", that it was believed everyone went to after death, irrespective of social status or the actions performed during life.<ref>Bottero (2001:108)</ref>

==Cultic practice==
{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote="[[Enlil]]! his authority is far-reaching; his word is sublime and holy. His decisions are unalterable; he decides fate forever! His eyes scrutinize the entire world!"|source=A prayer to the god Enlil.<ref>Bottero (2001:30<U+2013>31)</ref>
 }}
The pagan Mesopotamians venerated images of their gods, which it was believed actually held the essence or personality of the deity that they represented; this is evident from the poem ''How Erra Wrecked the World'', in which [[Erra (god)|Erra]] deceived the god [[Marduk]] into leaving his cult statue.<ref>Bottero (2001:65)</ref> A number of written [[prayers]] have survived from ancient Mesopotamia, each of which typically exalt the god that they are describing above all others.<ref>Bottero (2001:29<U+2013>30)</ref> The historian J. Bott<U+00E9>ro stated that these poems display "extreme reverence, profound devotion, [and] the unarguable emotion that the [[supernatural]] evoked in the hearts of those ancient believers" but that they showed a people who were scared of their gods rather than openly celebrating them.<ref name="Bottero 2001:37"/>

===Magic and witchcraft===
In parts of Mesopotamian religion, [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] was believed in and actively practiced. At the city of [[Uruk]], archaeologists have excavated houses dating from the 5th and 4th centuries BCE in which cuneiform clay tablets have been unearthed containing magical incantations.<ref>Davies (2009:8)</ref>

==Later influence==
===Historical study===
For many decades, some scholars of the Ancient Near East argued that it was impossible to define there as being a singular Mesopotamian religion, with Leo Oppenheim (1964) stating that "a systematic presentation of Mesopotamian religion cannot and should not be written."<ref>Bottero (2001:26)</ref> Others, like Jean Bott<U+00E9>ro, the author of ''Religion in Ancient Mesopotamia'', disagreed, believing that it would be too complicated to divide the religion into many smaller groups, stating that:

:Should we dwell on a certain social or cultural category: the "official religion," the "private religion," the religion of the "educated"... Should we emphasise a certain city or province: [[Ebla]], [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], [[Assyria]]? Should we concentrate on a certain period in time: the [[Seleucid]], the [[Achaemenid]], the [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldean]], the [[Neo-Assyrian]], the [[Kassite]], the Old [[Babylonian]], the Neo-Sumerian, or the Old Akkadian period? Since, contrary to what some would imprudently lead us to believe, there were no distinct religions but only successive states of the same religious system... <U+2013> such an approach would be excessive, even pointless.<ref>Bottero (2001:27)</ref>

===Influence on Abrahamic religions===
{{See|Panbabylonism}}
Many of the stories of the [[Tanakh]],<ref>{{Cite web|first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Assyria |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=2046&letter=A&search=Assyria |work= |publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia |id= |pages= |page= |date= |accessdate= |quote=. }}</ref> and the [[Qur'an]] are believed to have been based on, influenced by, or inspired by the legendary mythological past of the Near East. The [[Enuma Elish]] in particular has been compared to the [[Genesis creation narrative]]. The story of [[Esther]] in particular is traced to Babylonian roots. Others include [[The Great Flood]] and [[Noah]] which was influenced by the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] and the [[Tower of Babel]].

===New religious movements===
Various [[new religious movements]] in the 20th and 21st centuries have been founded that venerate some of the deities found in ancient Mesopotamian religion. In particular, various strains of [[Neopaganism]] have been formed that have adopted the worship of the historical Mesopotamian gods. Another modern religion to have adopted elements from the beliefs of ancient Mesopotamia is [[Anuism]], devoted to the god Anu, who supposedly revealed himself as being the Supreme Being to a man named V.E.M, who before then had known nothing of ancient Mesopotamia. Unlike Neopagan groups, Anuism was wholly [[monotheism|monotheistic]], treating Anu as the one and only God. The group ceased to exist in 2005-2006 (according to V.E.M.).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://babylon-rising.tribe.net/thread/6cdd9466-fe68-4541-b8af-236673c66188 |title=Views of Modern Mesopotamia |first=Victor |year=2004}}</ref> These religions are mainly based in the west, the United States and Europe, the surviving remnants of the actual Mesopotamians have shown no interest in these practices, preferring to follow various ancient Eastern Rite Christian denominations.

===Existing influence===
Mesopotamian religion, culture, history and mythology has influenced some forms of music. As well as traditional [[Assyrian/Syriac folk music|Assyrian music]], many [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands have named themselves after Mesopotamian gods and historical figures, including the partly ethnic Assyrian band [[Melechesh]]. 
[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] to this day still use the names of ancient Mesopotamian gods and rulers as both first and last names; [[Ashur]], [[Hadad]], [[Shamash]], [[Lilitu]]/[[Lilith]], [[Sennacherib]], [[Sin]] (Shinu), [[Sargon]], [[Semiramis]], [[Ishtar]] and [[Lamassu]] for example are still common names, and some months in the [[Assyrian calendar]] are named after ancient gods such as [[Tammuz]], and all periods are listed as being blessed by ancient gods.
