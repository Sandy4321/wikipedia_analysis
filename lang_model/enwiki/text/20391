'''''Jaws 2''''' is a [[1978 in film|1978]] [[horror film|horror]] [[thriller film|thriller]] film and the first sequel to [[Steven Spielberg]]'s 1975's ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''. Directed by [[Jeannot Szwarc]] and starring [[Roy Scheider]] as Police Chief Martin Brody who must deal with another [[Great White Shark]] terrorizing the waters of [[Amity Island]].

Like the first film, the production of ''Jaws 2'' was troubled. The original director, [[John D. Hancock]], proved to be unsuitable for an action film and was replaced by Szwarc.<ref name="makingof">''The Making of Jaws 2'' - DVD</ref> Scheider, who later claimed to have only reprised his role to end a contractual issue with Universal, was also unhappy during production and had several heated exchanges with Szwarc.<ref name="loynd103">Loynd, p 103</ref>

However, ''Jaws 2'' became the highest-grossing sequel in history at the time of its release in 1978 (though only kept this record for two years until the release of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' in 1980) and remained in the all-time Top 25 for more than two decades. The film's [[tagline]], "Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...", became one of the most famous in movie history and has been parodied and homaged several times.<ref name="kuhn">{{cite news |title= Andrew Kuehn, 66, Innovator In the Movie Trailer Industry |work=New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E4D9173BF930A35751C0A9629C8B63 |date=2004-02-03 |accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref> Although there would be two further films in the series, ''Jaws 2'' is generally regarded as the best of the sequels.<ref name="Beek">{{cite web |first=Mike |last=Beek |title=Jaws 2 |work=Music from the Movies |url=http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/review.asp?ID=4823 |accessdate=2006-12-17}}</ref>

==Plot==
Two divers photographing the wreck of the ''Orca'', [[Quint (Jaws character)|Quint]]'s boat, are attacked and killed by a [[Great White Shark|great white shark]]. The next day, Police Chief Martin Brody ([[Roy Scheider]]) receives a report that there is an abandoned [[yacht]] in the nearby channel. He orders Deputy Hendricks ([[Jeffrey Kramer]]) to investigate and recover the underwater camera from the missing divers. Meanwhile, the shark attacks a water skier named Terri and drags her into the water. Terri tries to pull herself up but fails and gets eaten. The driver of the speedboat defends herself by first throwing a gasoline tank at the shark (accidentally spilling some on herself) and then igniting the fuel with a flare gun. The shark begins to burn, as does the inside of the boat and the driver. Then the fire ignites the actual gas tank and the speedboat explodes. A woman who lives on the beach sees the explosion and reports it to the authorities. The shark manages to escape, but is severely scarred. Brody becomes suspicious after no remains of the water skier or the driver are found in the wreck. Meanwhile, Deputy Hendricks searches for the remains of the victims, accidentally hooking an underwater power line.

In addition to these disappearances, a [[killer whale]] bearing large wounds is beached, which Brody suggests were caused by a shark. A [[marine biologist]], Dr. Elkins ([[Collin Wilcox (actress)|Collin Wilcox]]) is skeptical, but she confirms to Brody that sharks are attracted to blood, movement and sound, like [[sonar]] or [[radar]]. Brody has a meeting with Mayor Vaughn ([[Murray Hamilton]]) to discuss the possibility that the town is having another shark problem. Vaughn doesn't believe him and warns Brody not to do something hasty. Later, Brody spots a section of the ruined speedboat bobbing in the surf just off the beach. When he goes to retrieve it he encounters the burnt remains of the boat driver.

That night, Brody injects [[sodium cyanide]] into a dozen [[hollowpoint]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]s and seals them over with wax. Brody tries to contact Matt Hooper but he is out on an expedition at sea. Angered by his older son Mike's (Mark Gruner) reluctance to find a summer job and concerned that he wishes to be out on the ocean sailing, he grounds him, getting him a summer job doing maintenance work at the beach. The next day, from atop an [[observation tower]], Brody believes that he sees the shadow of a large shark approaching the bathers. He orders everyone out of the water, firing his gun and creating a panic, and is publicly humiliated when the shadow is revealed to be merely a school of [[bluefish]]. However, Brody's suspicions are further fueled when he also acquires prints from the diver's camera showing [[close-up]]s of the shark's eye. Brody's suspicions are not shared by the town [[selectmen]] and local developer Len Peterson ([[Joseph Mascolo]]) at a time when the town is enjoying a revival in its tourist industry. Vaughn, angry with Brody's performance on the beach, fires him.

The next morning, Mike sneaks out of his house to go sailing with his friends, but his younger brother Sean (Marc Gilpin) catches him and insists he be brought along. The group head out to sea. On their way, they pass a team of divers, led by instructor Tom Andrews (Barry Coe). Moments after entering the water, Tom encounters the shark. Panicking, he rushes to the surface, causing an [[embolism]]. Meanwhile, two of the teens, Tina (Ann Dusenberry) and Eddie (Gary Dubin), encounter the shark when it bumps their boat, causing Eddie to fall into the water. Eddie does not survive the [[shark attack]], which leaves Tina alone and terrified in the boat.

Brody drives Ellen ([[Lorraine Gary]]) to work, notices an ambulance speeding to the docks and follows it. They find Tom is being put into an ambulance and Brody suspects that something might have scared him below the water. Hendricks informs Brody that Mike is sailing with others, so he insists on taking the police launch to rescue them. Ellen and Hendricks join him. They find Tina's boat, with Tina hiding under a blanket inside, who hysterically confirms Brody's suspicions that a shark is responsible. Hendricks and Ellen take Tina to shore while Brody continues to search for the teens in the police launch.

All seems well with the teens until the shark appears, bumping one of the sailboats, and causing a panic which leaves everyone ramming into each other with their sailboats. Mike is knocked unconscious after banging his head on a metal fitting and is nearly eaten by the shark before two of his friends can pull him out of the water. They save Mike and head back to shore for help. The rest of the teens remain floating on the wreckage of tangled boats, drifting away towards the open sea. A Coast Guard marine helicopter spots them and a line is rigged to tow them into shore. Before the pilot can tow them, the shark attacks one of the [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoon]]s, causing the chopper to tilt and capsize, and the pilot fails to surface. Sean falls into the water and is quickly saved by Marge (Martha Swatek) who heaves him up out of the water onto a floating [[hull (watercraft)|hull]], sacrificing herself to the shark in the process to save Sean.

Brody meets Mike and he informs his father that Sean is with the others, who are drifting towards Cable Junction, a small island made of rock which houses an electrical relay station. Brody quickly finds them, but the shark appears and Brody runs the police launch aground on the rocks of Cable Junction. Brody tries to tie a rope line, but snags an underwater power line instead. Most of the teenagers  are tossed into the water during the shark's next attack and swim to Cable Junction, the shark managing to scrape one of the teens in the process. Using an inflatable raft, Brody taunts the shark by pounding the power line with an [[oar]], trying to entice the beast to bite on the [[power cable]]. The plan succeeds and the shark gets [[electrocuted]] and is killed. Brody paddles the raft over to the sailboat wreckage and helps Jackie, one of the teens, and Sean get into the raft{{ndash}}they were the only ones not knocked into the water previously. He then paddles them back towards the other teens at Cable Junction to await rescue.

==Production==
The studio demanded a sequel early into the success of ''Jaws''.<ref name="makingof"/>  [[Howard Sackler]], who had contributed to the script of the original movie but chose not to be credited, was charged with writing the first draft. He originally proposed a [[prequel]] based on the sinking of the ''[[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS Indianapolis]]'' relayed by [[Quint (Jaws character)|Quint]] in the first film. Universal Studios President [[Sid Sheinberg]], however, rejected the idea.<ref>Loynd, p 24-5</ref> Sheinberg suggested that his wife [[Lorraine Gary]] "should go out on a boat and help to rescue the kids". [[Richard D. Zanuck]] got wind of this and replied "Over my dead body". The next draft of the ''Jaws 2'' screenplay was turned in with Gary not going out to sea.

In October 1975, [[Steven Spielberg]]  told the [[San Francisco Film Festival]] that "making a sequel to anything is just a cheap carny trick" and that he did not even respond to the producers when they asked him to direct ''Jaws 2''. He told the audience that the planned plot was to involve the sons of Quint and Brody hunting a new shark.<ref>{{cite book |last=Baxter |first=John |year=1997 |title=Steven Spielberg: The Unauthorised Biography |location=London |publisher=Harper Collins |page=145 |isbn=0006384447}}</ref> Brown, however, says that Spielberg did not want to direct the sequel because he felt that he had done the "definitive shark movie".<ref name="makingof"/>

On Sackler's recommendation, theatre director [[John D. Hancock]] was chosen to helm the picture.<ref>Loynd, p 27.</ref> However, Sackler felt betrayed when Dorothy Tristan, Hancock's wife, was invited to rewrite his script. Hancock began to feel the pressure of directing his first epic adventure film "with only three film credits, and all small-scale dramas".<ref>Loynd, p 66</ref> The producers were unhappy with his material, and on a Saturday evening in June 1977, after a meeting with the producers and Universal executives, the director was fired. He and his wife were unexpectedly whisked away to [[Rome]] and production was shut down for a few weeks. They had been involved in the film for eighteen months.<ref>Loynd, p 70</ref> Echoing the production of the first film, [[Carl Gottlieb]] was enlisted to further revise the script, adding humor and reducing some of the violence. It cost the producers more money to hire Gottlieb to do the rewrite than it would have if they had hired him in the first place.<ref>Loynd, p 36-7</ref>

At this point, Spielberg considered returning to direct the sequel. Over the Bicentennial weekend Spielberg hammered out a screenplay based on Quint's "''Indianapolis''" speech. Because of his contract for ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', however, he would not be able to film for a further year, a gap too long for the producers.<ref>Loynd, p 73</ref> Production Designer [[Joe Alves]] (who would direct ''[[Jaws 3-D]]'') and [[Verna Fields]] (who had been promoted to vice-president at Universal after her acclaimed editing on the original film) proposed that they co-direct it.<ref name="makingof"/><ref>Loynd, p 74</ref> The request was declined by the [[Directors Guild of America|DGA]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Rosenfield |title=Women in Hollywood |work=Los Angeles Times |date=1982-07-13}}</ref> partly because they would not allow a DGA member to be replaced by someone who was not one of its members, and partly because they, in the wake of events on the set of ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'', had instituted a ban on any cast or crew members taking over as director during production of a film. The reins were eventually handed to [[Jeannot Szwarc]], best known for the TV movie ''[[Bug (1975 film)|Bug]]'' and ''[[Night Gallery]]'' and whom Alves knew from the ''Night Gallery'' days.<ref>Loynd p 75-6</ref> Szwarc recommenced production by filming a complicated scene (the waterskier scene) which would give Gottlieb some time to write.<ref name="makingof"/> He reinstated the character of Deputy Hendricks, played by [[Jeffrey Kramer]], who had been missing from the original script.<ref name="makingof"/> Many of the teenagers were sacked, with the remaining roles developed.<ref>Jaws 2: A Portrait by Actor [[Keith Gordon]] [DVD extra]</ref>

Three sharks were built for the film. The first was the "platform shark", also referred to as the "luxurious shark". Production designer [[Joe Alves]] and special mechanical effects designed Bob Mattey were able to use the same mold for the shark as for the original film.<ref name="makingof"/> However, they had to redo the electronics as the originals had been left out on the lot. Mattey's design was much more complicated and ambitious than the original film. "Cable Junction", the island shown in the climax of the movie, was a floating barge that accommodated the mechanisms of the 'platform shark'. The other 'sharks' were a fin, and a full shark. Both could be pulled by boats.<ref name="makingof"/>

Although the first film was commended for leaving the shark to the imagination until two thirds of the way through, Szwarc felt that they should show it as much as possible because the "first image of it coming out of the water" could never be repeated.<ref name="makingof"/> Although critics complained that the additional screen time awarded to the shark makes it "seems far less terrifying than its almost mystical contemporary",<ref name="bbc"/> Szwarc believed that the reduction of the first's [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcockian]] suspense was inevitable because the audience already knew what the shark looked like from the final third of the first film. Reviewers have since commented that  "there was no way that they were ever going to duplicate the effectiveness of the original".<ref name="lytz">{{cite web |title=JAWS 2 (1978) |work=And You Call Yourself a Scientist? |url=http://twtd.bluemountains.net.au/Rick/jaws2.htm |accessdate=2007-01-08}}</ref> However, the filmmakers gave it a more menacing look by scarring it in the early boat explosion.<ref name="makingof"/><ref name="jabootu">{{cite web |first=Ken |last=Begg |title=Jaws 2 - Jabootu's Bad Movie Dimension |url=http://www.jabootu.com/jaws2.htm |accessdate=2007-01-07}}</ref>

===Scheider's involvement===
[[Roy Scheider]] reluctantly returned to reprise his role as Martin Brody. He had quit the role of 'Michael' in ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''  two weeks into the production because of "creative differences." Universal agreed to 'forget' about this if he appeared in ''Jaws 2'', which they would count as the remaining two of his contractual obligations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jaws 2 FAQ |work=jawsmovie.com |url=http://www.jawsmovie.com/2/faq.asp |accessdate=2006-11-30}}</ref>

The atmosphere was tense on the set, and he often argued with Szwarc. The rift was articulated in written correspondence. In a letter to Szwarc, Scheider wrote that "working with Jeannot Szwarc is knowing he will never say he is sorry or ever admitting he overlooked something. Well enough of that shit for me!" He requested an apology from the director for not consulting him.<ref name="loynd103"/> Szwarc's reply focused upon completing the film to the "best possible" standard.

<blockquote>Time and pressure are part of my reality and priorities something I must deal with.<br />You have been consulted and your suggestions made part of my scenes many times, whenever they did not contradict the overall concept of the picture.<br />If you have to be offended, I deplore it, for no offense was meant. At this point in the game, your feelings or my feelings are immaterial and irrelevant , the picture is all that matters.<br />Sincerely, Jeannot<ref>Loynd, p 104</ref></blockquote>

===Location===
[[Martha's Vineyard]] was again used as the location for the town scenes. Although some residents guarded their privacy, many islanders welcomed the money that the company was bringing.<ref>Loynd, p 60-2</ref> Shortly after the production arrived in June 1977, local newspaper the ''Grapevine'' wrote:

<blockquote>The ''Jaws'' people are back among us, more efficient, more organized and more moneyed. Gone are the happy-go-lucky days of the first ''Jaws'', where the big trucks roved about the Island from day to day, always highly visible with miles of cables snaking here and there over roads and lawns. Gone are the acrimonious wrangles and Select persons over noise and zoning regulations and this and that. What is still here is money -- about $2 million of it.<ref>Loynd, p 62</ref></blockquote>

Many residents enjoyed being cast as extras. Some people, however, were less enthused by the presence of the film crew and refused to co-operate. Only one drugstore allowed its windows to be boarded up for the moody look that Hancock wanted. "Universal Go Home" T-shirts began appearing on the streets in mid-June.<ref>Loynd, p 64</ref>

The majority of filming was at [[Navarre Beach, Florida|Navarre Beach]] in [[Florida]], because of the warm weather and that the water's depth was appropriate for the shark platform.<ref name="makingof"/> Cable Junction Island was built on a barge so that the huge mechanism of the platform shark could go close to, or even underneath, it. On one occasion the set broke loose from its anchorage and had to be rescued as it drifted towards [[Cuba]].<ref name="makingof"/> Real [[hammerhead shark]]s circled the teen actors during the filming of one shot. However, because their fictional personas were meant to be in distress, the crew (filming from a distance) did not realize that the actors were genuinely calling for help.<ref>Gilpin, Marc [http://www.sharkisstillworking.com/video/viewer.asp?v=gilpin.mov interviewed] for ''[[The Shark is Still Working]]'' documentary. Retrieved 7 January 2007.</ref>

The interior shots of the teen hang-out where they play [[pinball]] were filmed in the original location of the Hog's Breath Saloon on [[Okaloosa Island]].  This restaurant later relocated to [[Destin, Florida]] as its original building was susceptible to hurricane damage.  The original building was still vacant and derelict in January 2005, razed in 2007.  The production company had to seek dredge and fill permits from the State of [[Florida]]'s Department of Environmental Regulation to sink the revised platform that controlled the shark on the sea bottom.

[[John Williams]] returned to score ''Jaws 2'' after winning an [[Academy Award for Original Music Score]] for his work on the first film.  Szwarc said that the music for the sequel should be "more complex because it was a more complex film." Williams says that this score is broader, allowing him to make more use of the orchestra, and use longer notes, and "fill the space" created by the director.<ref>The Music of Jaws 2 [DVD extra]</ref>

Critics have praised Williams' score, comparing it favorably to the original. Williams "uses a few basic elements of the original<U+2014>the obligatory shark motif, for one<U+2014>and takes the music off in some new and interesting directions."<ref name="soundtrack">{{cite web |title=Jaws 2 |work=soundtrack-express.com |url=http://www.soundtrack-express.com/osts/jaws2.htm |accessdate=2006-12-17}}</ref> The score is "more disturbing in places" than the original, and "Williams fashion some new and hugely memorable out to sea adventure music."<ref name="soundtrack"/> Because ''Jaws 2'' "isn't a film that requires subtlety... Williams pulls out all the stops to make it as exciting and hair raising as possible."<ref name="soundtrack"/>

According to the [[liner notes]], Williams' "sense of the dramatic, coupled with his exquisite musical taste and knowledge of the orchestra definitely stamp this score as truly one of his best." It is "brilliantly performed by a mini-symphony made up of the finest instrumentalists to be found anywhere."<ref>John Fadden {{cite album-notes |title=Jaws 2 |year=1978 |bandname=John Williams |format=Cover |publisher=[[MCA Records]]}}</ref>

Due to time constraints, the film had not been completed when Williams began working on the score, "enabling him to create themes based on ideas and suggestions, rather than a locked down print." Mike Beek makes positive comments about the film, saying that "the music certainly elevates it to a level it would otherwise never have achieved."<ref name="Beek"/>

==Reaction==
[[Image:Jaws 2 teaser.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The teaser poster for ''Jaws 2'', bearing the famous tagline]]
According to David Brown, the film made 40% gross of the original. This was attractive to studios because it reduced [[market risk]].<ref name="makingof"/> The film was the highest-grossing sequel in history in 1978 and an all-time top 25 box office champ for more than two decades. It opened in 640 theaters, making $9,866,023 in its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jaws 2 |work=Box Office Mojo |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jaws2.htm |accessdate=2006-12-17}}</ref>

Although the film was initially met with mixed reviews, most critics agree that this is the best of the ''Jaws'' sequels.<ref name="Beek"/> On the film's ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'' listing, 58% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 19 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jaws_2 |title=''Jaws 2'' receives mixed reviews with a 58% rating at Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=2008-03-15}}</ref> DVD Authority says "After this one, the other ''Jaws'' movies seemed to just not be as good.<ref name="authority">{{cite web |title=Jaws 2 |work=DVD Authority |url=http://www.dvdauthority.com/reviews.asp?ReviewID=1355 |accessdate=2006-12-30}}</ref> One review says: "it's obviously not a patch on Spielberg's classic, but it's about as good as could be hoped for, with some excellent sequences, almost worthy of the original, several genuine shocks, a different enough story and some pretty decent characters."<ref name="soundtrack"/> The performances of Scheider, Gary and Hamilton are particularly praised.<ref name="Beek"/><ref name="lytz"/>

Although many critics identify some flaws, often comparing Szwarc negatively to Spielberg, they say that "this sequel does have some redeeming qualities going for it that make it a good movie in its own right".<ref>{{cite web |title=Jaws 2 |work=DVD.net.au |url=http://www.dvd.net.au/review.cgi?review_id=822 |accessdate=2006-12-30}}</ref> The presence of [[Richard Dreyfuss]] and [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]] are missed, especially since the teenage characters are labeled "largely annoying 'Afterschool Special' archetypes"<ref name="chambers">{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Chambers |title=Jaws 2 |work=Film Freak Central |url=http://www.filmfreakcentral.net/dvdreviews/jaws2.htm |accessdate=2006-12-30}}</ref> who are "irritating and incessantly screaming" and "don't make for very sympathetic victims".<ref name="bbc">{{cite web |first=Almar |last=Haflidason |title=Jaws 2 (1978) |work=bbc.co.uk |date=2001-07-31 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2000/07/14/jaws2_review.shtml |accessdate=2006-12-30}}</ref> Because of its emphasis upon the teenage cast some critics have compared the film to the [[slasher film]]s that were rising in popularity at that time.<ref name="lytz"/>

The film's [[tagline]], "Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...", has become one of the most famous in film history.<ref name="lytz"/> Andrew J. Kuehn, who developed the trailer for the original ''Jaws'', is credited with coining the phrase.<ref name="kuhn"/> It has been parodied in numerous films; most notably the tagline of the [[Flipper (1996 film)|1996 feature film adaptation]] of the television series, ''[[Flipper (1964 TV series)|Flipper]]'', "This summer it's finally safe to go back in the water."<ref>{{cite web |title=Taglines for Flipper (1996) |work=IMDb |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116322/taglines |accessdate=2006-12-17}}</ref>

==DVD release==
The film was released on DVD in 2001.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jaws 2 listing |work=amazon.com |url=http://www.amazon.com/Jaws-2-Roy-Scheider/dp/B00005A8XX/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1205020172&sr=8-1 |accessdate=2008-03-08}}</ref> Many reviewers praised it for the quantity of special features,<ref name="chambers"/> with ''DVD Authority'' asserting that it had "more than a lot of titles labeled as '[[Special Edition]]' discs".<ref name="authority"/> It includes a 45 minute documentary produced by Laurent Bouzereau, who is responsible for many of the documentaries about Universal films. Actor [[Keith Gordon]] reminisces in a short feature, and Szwarc explains the phonetic problems with its French title (''Les Dents de la mer 2'').

The disc also contains a variety of [[deleted scenes]]. One such scene shows the selectmen voting to fire Brody. The Mayor ([[Murray Hamilton]]) is the only person to vote to save him. Also included is footage of the shark attacking the coast guard pilot underwater after his helicopter had capsized. The scene was cut because of the struggle with the ratings board to acquire a [[Parental Guidance|PG certificate]].<ref name="chambers"/>

Although the audio was presented in [[Dolby Digital]] 2.0 mono, a reviewer for ''Film Freak Central'' comments that "Williams' score often sounds deceptively stereophonic".<ref name="chambers"/> The BBC, though, suggest that the mix "really demands the added bass that a [[5.1]] effort could have lent it".<ref name="bbcdvd">{{cite web |first=Almar |last=Haflidason |title=Jaws 2 DVD (1978) |work=bbc.co.uk |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/07/31/jaws_2_1978_dvd_review.shtml |accessdate=2006-12-30}}</ref>
