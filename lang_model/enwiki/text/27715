'''Benjamin S. "Ben" Kelsey''' (1906 &ndash; March 3, 1981) was an American [[aeronautical engineer]] and [[test pilot]] who brought success in [[World War II]] to the [[United States Army Air Forces]] by initiating the manufacture of innovative [[fighter aircraft]] designs, and by working to quickly increase American fighter production to meet the needs of the coming war.

Kelsey co-authored the technical specifications which led to the development of the [[P-39 Airacobra]] and the [[P-38 Lightning]]. He worked around [[United States Army Air Corps|Air Corps]] strictures to initiate the development of [[drop tank]]s for American fighters. Kelsey was the driving force behind a program of advanced airfoil research which eventually resulted in the [[P-51 Mustang]].

==Early career==
Benjamin S. Kelsey was born in [[Waterbury, Connecticut]] in 1906, and was raised there. At the age of 15 he completed a flying course with the Curtiss Flying Service at [[Garden City, New York]]. He graduated from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) with a bachelor of science degree in [[mechanical engineering]] in June 1928, and stayed to teach and conduct research work in the aeronautics department.<ref name=afmil/>

Kelsey flew extensively for commercial concerns as well as privately, and obtained a transport pilot license. He joined the [[United States Army Air Corps]] and was commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] on May 2, 1929. At [[Mitchel Air Force Base|Mitchel Field]], he worked with the Guggenheim Fog Flying Laboratory. As stipulated by [[Harry Frank Guggenheim|Harry Guggenheim]], Kelsey flew as Lieutenant [[Jimmy Doolittle]]'s safety pilot during the first fully 'blind' [[Instrument flight rules|instrument flight]] on September 24, 1929, showing observers that he was not in control by keeping his hands visible outside the cockpit.<ref>{{cite book |title=Lightning in the Sky - The Story of Jimmy Doolittle |last=Mann |first=Carl |authorlink= |year=1943 |publisher=Robert M.

Assigned with the [[20th Fighter Wing|20th Pursuit Group]] at [[Mather Air Force Base|Mather Field]] and later at [[Barksdale Air Force Base|Barksdale Field]], he served in various tactical unit duties.<ref name=afmil/>

==Fighter development==

In 1934, Kelsey was transferred to [[Air Force Materiel Command|Materiel Command]] at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright Field]] near [[Dayton, Ohio]] and served as fighter project officer in the Engineering Section. Kelsey continued to research blind landing techniques and develop instrument flying practices and hardware. On October 1, 1934 he gained the rank of [[first lieutenant]].<ref name=afmil/>

As Project Officer for Fighters, Kelsey tested a great number of aircraft models, possibly flying more new types of US fighters than any other pilot.<ref name=Boyne2001>{{cite book |title=The Best of Wings Magazine |last=Boyne |first=Walter J. |authorlink= |year=2001 |page=116 |id= |isbn=1-57488-368-2|publisher=Brassey's|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=i984H9SGXGgC&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116 |accessdate=March 25, 2009 |quote=...Kelsey probably flew more new types of U.S. fighters than any other pilot... }}</ref> He was first to fly the [[Bell Aircraft|Bell]] twin-engine [[YFM-1 Airacuda|XFM-1 Airacuda]] prototype on September 1, 1937.<ref name=Boyne2001/>

===P-39 Airacobra===
Kelsey became frustrated by inflexible Air Corps restrictions on pursuit (fighter) aircraft which limited the weight of all guns and ammunition to 500&nbsp;lbs. He wished for at least 1,000&nbsp;lbs of armament so that American fighters could dominate their battles.<ref>Bodie, 1991, p. 14.</ref> Kelsey formulated two new high-altitude fighter specifications in February, 1937; one for a single-engine fighter and one for a twin-engine fighter. In Circular Proposal X-608 and X-609, Kelsey employed the word "interceptor" which had not yet been applied to American military aircraft specifications. In this way, he bypassed the Air Corps limitations.<ref name=WarEagles2006/> Kelsey specified [[Allison V-1710]] engines with [[General Electric]] [[turbocharger|turbo-supercharger]]s and [[tricycle undercarriage|tricycle landing gear]] in both proposals, aiming for 360&nbsp;mph performance, long range, the ability to climb to 20,000&nbsp;ft in six minutes, and very heavy armament including a cannon.<ref>Bodie, 1991, pp. 16<U+2013>17.</ref>

Bell Aircraft won the single-engine X-609 contract with their design of the [[P-39 Airacobra]]. After the prototype flew, Kelsey was called to England, and handed oversight of the project off to colleagues who, in keeping with advice from the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA), ordered the removal of turbo-superchargers from the aircraft. The P-39 was from that point forward unable to compete in the European Theater against high-altitude German fighters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aviation-history.com/engines/allison.htm|title=Allison V-1710 - USA|author=Dwyer, Larry|accessdate=March 25, 2009 |publisher=Aviation-History.com |date=August 6, 2005|quote=...there is no doubt that the deletion of the turbo-supercharger ruined the P-39.}}</ref>

===P-38 Lightning===
[[Lockheed]] won the X-608 proposal with their twin-engine Model 22 design, signing a contract with the Air Corps in June 1937.<ref name=WarEagles2006/> Kelsey flew the first prototype of the [[P-38 Lightning]], the XP-38, on January 27, 1939.<ref name=WarEagles2006>{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |month=October<U+2013>December |title=Featured Aircraft |journal=Plane Talk: The Newsletter of the War Eagles Air Museum |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=1<U+2013>3, 6 |id= |url=http://www.war-eagles-air-museum.com/newsletters/weam_newsletter_2006-4.pdf |accessdate=2009-03-26 |quote= }}</ref> After Lockheed performed a series of tests and associated engineering adjustments, Kelsey took the prototype across the country on a record-breaking speed flight in February 1939. Just short of his goal, as he was directed into the landing pattern at Mitchel Field behind three slower aircraft, his prototype's carburetors iced up and quit. Kelsey belly-landed into a sand trap at a golf course, destroying the plane.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Sleek, Fast and Luckless |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,760764,00.html |work= |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date=February 20, 1939 |accessdate=25 March 2009 }}</ref> His superiors were very happy with the speed demonstration and ordered Kelsey to proceed with further development of the design. In May, he was promoted to the rank of captain.<ref name=afmil/>

===France and Britain===
From May to July 1940 Kelsey was sent as assistant military attache for air to Europe to assess the technical progress of German, French and British fighter aircraft. Kelsey traveled to France with Colonel [[Carl Andrew Spaatz|Carl "Tooey" Spaatz]], Lieutenant Colonel [[Frank O'Dwyer Hunter|Frank O<U+2019>Dwyer "Monk" Hunter]] and Major [[George C. Kenney]] to witness firsthand how France's defenses were insufficient. (Each of these men later attained the rank of general.) Kelsey and the group of American airmen saw that self-sealing fuel tanks were critical in air combat. As well, fighters appeared to require bullet-proof windscreens and better oxygen systems. After passing through Paris, Spaatz and Kelsey flew back to London on May 31.<ref name=Hallion1998>{{cite web|title=The Battle of Britain in American Context and Perspective |url=http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/EARS/Hallionpapers/battleofbritainsep98.htm|author=Hallion, Dr. Richard P.|accessdate=March 28, 2009 |publisher=United States Air Force History and Museums Program |date=September 5, 1998}}</ref> In England, Kelsey determined that the threat posed to Allied convoys by German air and naval power meant that a ferry route should be established over the North Atlantic so that long-range aircraft could be flown to the United Kingdom. Kelsey spent a month touring British airfields, air groups and aircraft manufacturing facilities, receiving excellent cooperation from [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) personnel. While Spaatz and Hunter remained in England, Kelsey helped a group of war refugees travel to the United States,<ref name=Hallion1998/> returning himself to Wright Field as chief of the Pursuit Branch in the Production Engineering Section. In March 1941, Kelsey was promoted to Major (temporary).<ref name=afmil/>

===Spitfire evaluation===
In April, 1941 the RAF sent two [[Supermarine Spitfire variants#Mk V (types 331, 349 & 352)|Spitfire Mark V]] fighters to Dayton for testing. The variant used a pressurized cockpit for high-altitude pilot comfort<U+2014>the pilot would not have to wear an oxygen mask. Kelsey was asked to ferry one of the aircraft to and from [[Los Angeles, California]] for further examination. Because of the Spitfire's inherent range limitations, Kelsey was forced to make a number of refueling stops at little-used air fields. Kelsey noted engine overheating during taxiing and [[brake fade]] on long desert runways with significant crosswind. He found long cross-country flight very tiring due to the Spitfire's marginal stability (which gave it high maneuverability in combat.) Kelsey felt that the highly-lauded fighter would not have been approved for purchase in the United States where requirements included long range capability.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fire in the Sky |last=Bergerud |first=Eric M. |authorlink= |year=2000 |publisher=Westview Press |location=Boulder, Colorado, USA and Cumnor Hill, Oxford, UK |isbn=0813338697 |pages=231<U+2013>232 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GZCNhrm9eOYC&pg=PA231&lpg=PA231 |accessdate=March 26, 2009 }}</ref>

===Drop tanks===
In November, 1941 Kelsey asked his Lockheed contacts to design [[drop tank]]s to extend the range of the P-38, even though Air Corps policy at the time was absolutely inflexible toward fighter aircraft carrying external fuel tanks<U+2014>the extreme flammability of such tanks was a liability in combat.<ref>Bodie, 1991, p. 72.</ref>

===P-51 Mustang===
The existence of the [[P-51 Mustang]] has been credited to Kelsey's dogged determination to see the project to completion.<ref name=GML2>{{cite web |url=http://www.gml2007.com/history2.asp| title=P-51 History: NA-73 Prototype|accessdate=March 26, 2009 |publisher=The Gathering of Mustangs & Legends |quote=First Lieutenant Benjamin S. Kelsey. Lt. Kelsey was head of the Army Air Corps Pursuit Projects Office at Wright Field, and he was the single most important man in the acquisition of what would eventually become the P51 Mustang fighter. ...he ingeniously found the means and the money to keep the program going until America's entry into the war ensured its success.}}</ref> He formulated the specifications for the [[Curtiss XP-46]] and placed an order for two prototypes in September 1939, hoping that the advanced aircraft would replace the [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Warhawk]] which had not demonstrated above-average fighting qualities. Production of the new design was canceled by General [[Henry H. Arnold|Henry "Hap" Arnold]] as it was anticipated that a four-month delay in Curtiss fighter deliveries would be incurred by the radical change. Kelsey's boss, Colonel Oliver P. Echols, shopped the design to the Anglo-French Purchasing Commission who were told to find an aircraft manufacturer that wasn't busy with war production. Echols and Kelsey made it understood that the NACA airflow research data collected on the XP-46 would be made available to the new manufacturer. [[North American Aviation]] (NAA) expressed interest and was sold the NACA data for $56,000. They produced a new design, the NA-73, which was approved by the British who christened the fighter "Mustang". Echols and Kelsey arranged to get two prototypes out of the British contract, and, on July 7, 1941,  even before the prototypes arrived at Wright Field, Kelsey ordered 150 P-51s from NAA, as well as 500 nearly identical [[North American A-36|A-36 Apache]] models that he was able to purchase with funds intended for attack bombers.<ref name=GML3>{{cite web |url=http://www.gml2007.com/history3.asp| title=P-51 History: Mustang I|accessdate=March 26, 2009 |publisher=The Gathering of Mustangs & Legends}}</ref>

===North Atlantic ferry operation===
In January 1942, a month after the United States declared war, Kelsey was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel. In the spring of 1942 Kelsey was attached to the [[VIII Fighter Command]] at [[Bangor International Airport|Dow Field]] near [[Bangor, Maine]] to assist in preparing for trans-Atlantic ferry flights, and the following July, now an acting colonel, he flew in the first ferry flight of fighters across the North Atlantic to England. Returning to the States in September 1942, he resumed his former position as chief of the Pursuit Branch, and the following July he was named chief of the Flight Research Branch, Flight Test Division.<ref name=afmil/>

On April 9, 1943 Kelsey performed a flight test on a P-38 to see if Lockheed's newly developed dive flap could be engaged after terminal velocity was reached in a dive. Kelsey's aircraft lost one wing and the tail, and entered an inverted flat spin. Kelsey bailed out and suffered a broken ankle upon landing. The P-38 crashed upside down into a hillside near [[Calabasas, California]].<ref>Bodie, 1991, pp. 166-167.</ref>

Going to England in November 1943, Kelsey was deputy chief of staff of the [[IX Fighter Command]], and the following February he was appointed chief of the Operation Engineering Section of the [[Eighth Air Force]] Headquarters. In February 1945 he was assigned to the Materiel Division at Air Corps Headquarters.<ref name=afmil/>

==Staff roles==
After Germany surrendered, Kelsey was assigned to the Materiel Command at Wright Field as chief of the All-Weather Operations Section. He reverted to the permanent rank of Major in 1946, and from December 1946 to January 1948 he served successively as assistant deputy commanding general for personnel; deputy commanding general for personnel, and chief of personnel and administration.<ref name=afmil/>

Returning to Air Force Headquarters in February 1948, Kelsey was chief of the Control Group in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Materiel. Kelsey attained the permanent rank of colonel in April. Entering the [[National War College]] in August 1948, he graduated the following June and remained there as an instructor. In June 1952 he was appointed Deputy Director of Research and Development in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Development at Air Force Headquarters, and was promoted to brigadier general in September.<ref name=afmil/>

Kelsey reverted to his permanent rank of colonel December 30, 1955 and retired from active duty the following day.<ref name=afmil/>

==Later life==
Kelsey continued to fly after retirement. He owned a [[Cessna 190]] and worked to restore a [[Pitts Special]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://earlyaviators.com/emerrill.htm| title=Henry Tyndal Merrill: 1894-1982|accessdate=March 25, 2009 |publisher=EarlyAviators.com |date=}}</ref>

Kelsey wrote about aeronautical subjects and gave lectures. In 1959, he was honored by MIT with the [[Jerome C. Hunsaker Visiting Professor of Aerospace Systems]] award.<ref>{{cite journal|title=General to Speak; Kelsey is MIT Grad, Veteran Aviator|journal=The Tech|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|location=Cambridge, MA|date=[[October 20]], [[1959]]|volume=79|issue=33|pages=4|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V79/PDF/N33.pdf|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref> In carrying out the duties of the award, Kelsey gave a talk about the factors which determine the optimum size of aircraft; the engineering lecture was published in 1960.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kelsey|first=Benjamin S.|title=Size Considerations in Optimum Aircraft (Minta Martin Lecture)|year=1960|publisher=Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences|location=New York|oclc=14974554}}</ref>

In September 1977, Kelsey was invited to participate in a 50th anniversary symposium celebrating the P-38 Lightning, organized by Lockheed veterans. [[Tony LeVier]], [[Clarence Johnson|Kelly Johnson]] and some Lightning aces shared a panel discussion with him, and Kelsey participated in interviews recalling the history of fighter development in World War II.<ref>Bodie, 1991</ref>

A comprehensive history of American aircraft development in World War II was completed by Kelsey in 1980. Kelsey died on March 3, 1981; ''The Dragon's Teeth?: The Creation of United States Air Power for World War II'' was published posthumously by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1982.<ref>Kelsey, 1982</ref>
