The '''Massachusett language''' was a [[Native American languages|Native American language]], a member of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language family. It is also known as '''''W<U+00F4>pan<U+00E2>ak''''' (Wampanoag), '''Natick''', and '''Pokanoket'''.

Massachusett was spoken by the [[Massachusett]] and the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] nations of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who lived in the area of present-day [[Boston]], on [[Cape Cod]], and on the islands of [[Martha's Vineyard]] and [[Nantucket]], [[Massachusetts]].  Massachusett was one of the first Native American languages which English settlers learned, and the first Bible published in the colony was a translation in Massachusett, in 1663. 

Massachusett is the first Native American language to be revived in the United States after its last speakers had died; the work has been led since 1993 by [[Jessie Little Doe Baird]] and the Wampanoag Language Reclamation Project.  

==Early translation==
The first [[Bible]] published in [[North America]] was a translation of the entire Bible into Massachusett; translated and printed in 1663 by [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]], a missionary associated with the Indian College at Harvard. He followed with a primer in 1669, and a second edition of the Bible in 1685.<ref>[http://southcarolina1670.wordpress.com/2011/09/19/a-glance-back-at-americas-first-bible/ "A Glance Back at America's First Bible," ''Cotton Boll Conspiracy'', September 19, 2011]</ref>  Eliot's missionary work led to [[literacy]] among the Wampanoag, who left many wills, deeds, and other documents written in Massachusett using the [[orthography]] he introduced.  As a result of the tradition of literacy, Massachusett has a much richer documentation than many other [[list of extinct languages|extinct]] Native American languages.  

The [[Lord's Prayer]] in Massachusett: 

:''Nooshun kesukqut, wunneetupantamuch koowesuounk.  Peyamooutch kukkeitasootamounk. Toh anantaman ne n-naj okheit, neane kesukqut.  Asekesukokish petukqunnegash assaminnean yeu kesukok.

Newutche keitassootamoonk, kutahtauun, menuhkesuonk, sohsumoonk micheme kah micheme.  Amen.''

==Revival==
Since 1993 [[Jessie Little Doe Baird]], a Mashpee Wampanoag, has led the effort to revive the language within the Wampanoag nation more than a century after it was last spoken. She earned a Master's in Algonquian Linguistics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 2000, and has compiled an 10,000-word dictionary, as well as developed a Wampanoag grammar (see below).<ref name="Mifflin">[http://www.technologyreview.com/article/20629/ Jeffrey Mifflin, "Saving a Language: A rare book in MIT's archives helps linguists revive a long-unused Native American language"], ''Technology Review'', May/June 2008, accessed 18 November 2011</ref>

This is the first time in the United States that a language has been revived after the death of all native speakers, and in 2010 Baird was awarded a [[MacArthur Fellowship]] for her leadership.<ref name="pbs"/> The work of the ''W<U+00F4>pan<U+00E2>ak'' (Wampanoag) Language Reclamation Project has been documented in the film, ''We Still Live Here - <U+00C2>s Nutayune<U+00E2>n,'' by the filmmaker [[Anne Makepeace]]; it is being shown on PBS local stations at different dates during November 2011.<ref name="pbs"/>

The work has been a collaboration among members of The Assonet Band of Wampanoag, The [[Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe]], the [[Wampanoag Tribe of Aquinnah]] and the Herring Pond Band of Wampanoag.<ref name="Wampanoag">[http://wlrp.org/index.html The W<U+00F4>pan<U+00E2>ak (Wampanoag) Language Reclamation Project]</ref> They are training adult facilitators to teach young children and develop a curriculum; the long-term goal is to establish a school in ''W<U+00F4>pan<U+00E2>ak.''<ref name="Mifflin"/>

==Phonology==
As reconstructed by Algonquianists, Massachusett had 11 consonants, two short vowels, and four long vowels. The consonants consisted of the [[Stop consonant|stop]]s {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/c/}}, {{IPA|/t<U+0361><U+0283>/}}, and {{IPA|/k/}}; [[Fricative consonant|fricative]]s {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/<U+0283>/}}; [[Nasal consonant|nasal]]s {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}; and [[semivowel]]s {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}. The short vowels were {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/<U+0259>/}}, and the long vowels were {{IPA|/i<U+02D0>/}}, {{IPA|/u<U+02D0>/}}, {{IPA|/a<U+02D0>/}}, and {{IPA|/<U+00E3><U+02D0>/}}.<ref>Walker (1997:159)</ref>
