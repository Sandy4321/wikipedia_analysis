'''Project Loon''' is a [[research and development]] project being developed by [[Google]] with the mission of providing [[Internet access]] to [[rural area|rural]] and remote areas. The project uses [[high-altitude balloon]]s placed in the [[stratosphere]] at an altitude of about {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} to create an aerial [[wireless network]] with up to [[3G]]-like speeds.<ref name="wired 2013-06"> {{cite web|last=Levy|first=Steven|title=How Google Will Use High-Flying Balloons to Deliver Internet to the Hinterlands|url=http://www.wired.com/business/2013/06/google_internet_balloons/all/google.com/loon|date=14 June 2013|work=Wired|accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref><ref name="AFP 2013-06">{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jzP2DG8WdyTFsRBXkX5IHRDod8UA?docId=CNG.1e0cb853eae78a4ee2a211df3413fa9a.01|title=Google to beam Internet from balloons|date=15 June 2013|work=Agence France-Presse|publisher=Google|accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Google launches Project Loon|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/internet/news/article.cfm?c_id=137&objectid=10890750|date=15 June 2013|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Lardinois|first=Frederic|title=Google X Announces Project Loon: Balloon-Powered Internet For Rural, Remote And Underserved Areas|url=http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/14/google-x-announces-project-loon-balloon-powered-internet-for-rural-remote-and-underserved-areas/|date=14 June 2013|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref> Because of the project's somewhat outlandish mission goals, Google dubbed it "Project [[wiktionary:loon|Loon]]".<ref name="CNET netaccess">{{cite web|last=Mack|first=Eric|title=Meet Google's 'Project Loon:' Balloon-powered 'net access|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57589464-1/meet-googles-project-loon-balloon-powered-net-access/|work=CNET|accessdate=15 June 2013|date=14 June 2013}}</ref>

The balloons are maneuvered by adjusting their altitude to float to a wind layer after identifying the wind layer with the desired speed and direction using wind data from the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA). Users of the service connect to the balloon network using a special Internet antenna attached to their building. The signal travels through the balloon network from balloon to balloon, then to a ground-based station connected to an ISP, then onto the global Internet. The system aims to bring Internet access to remote and rural areas poorly served by existing provisions, and to improve communication during [[natural disaster]]s to affected regions.<ref name="CNET netaccess"/><ref name="arstechnica 2013-06">{{cite web|last=Brodkin|first=Jon|title=Google flies Internet balloons in stratosphere for a <U+201C>network in the sky<U+201D>|url=http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/06/google-flies-internet-balloons-in-stratosphere-for-a-network-in-the-sky/|date=14 June 2013|work=ArsTechnica|accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref> Key people involved in the project include Rich DeVaul, chief technical architect, who is also an expert on [[wearable technology]]; [[Mike Cassidy (entrepreneur)|Mike Cassidy]], a project leader; and Cyrus Behroozi, a networking and telecommunication lead.<ref name="wired 2013-06"/>

== History ==

In 2008, Google had considered contracting with or acquiring Space Data Corp., a company that sends balloons carrying small base stations about {{convert|20|mi|km|Abbr=on}} up in the air for providing connectivity to truckers and oil companies in the southern United States, but didn't do so.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sharma|first=Amol|title=Floating a New Idea For Going Wireless, Parachute Included|url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB120347353988378955.html|date=20 February 2008|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref>

Unofficial development on the project began in 2011 under incubation in [[Google X]] with a series of trial runs in [[California]]'s [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]. The project was officially announced as a Google project on 14 June 2013.<ref name="wired 2013-06"/>

On 16 June 2013, Google began a [[pilot experiment]] in [[New Zealand]] where about 30 balloons were launched in coordination with the [[Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand|Civil Aviation Authority]] from the [[Lake Tekapo (town)|Tekapo area]] in the [[South Island]]. About 50 local users in and around [[Christchurch]] and the [[Canterbury Region]] will test connections to the aerial network using special antennas.<ref name="wired 2013-06"/> After this initial trial, Google plans on sending up 300 balloons around the world at the [[40th parallel south]] that would provide coverage to New Zealand, Australia, Chile, and Argentina. Google hopes to eventually have thousands of balloons flying in the stratosphere at an altitude of {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name="wired 2013-06"/><ref name="AFP 2013-06"/>

== Technology ==

The technology designed in the project could allow countries to avoid using expensive fiber cable that would have to be installed underground to allow users to connect to the Internet. Google feels this will greatly increase Internet usage in developing countries in regions such as Africa and Southeast Asia that can't afford to lay underground fiber cable.<ref name="AP 2013-06">{{cite web|title=Google launches Internet-beaming balloons|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/google-begins-launching-internet-beaming-balloons|author=Perry, Nick|coauthors=Mendoza, Martha|date=15 June 2013|work=The Associated Press|accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref>

The high-altitude balloons fly around the world on the prevailing winds (mostly in a direction parallel with lines of latitude, i.e. east or west). Solar panels about the size of a card table that are just below the free-flying balloons generate enough electricity in four hours to power the transmitter for a day and beam down the Internet signal to ground stations. These stations are spaced about {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} apart and bounce the signal to other relay balloons that send the signal back down. This makes Internet access available to anyone in the world who has a receiver and is within range to a balloon.<ref name="AP 2013-06"/> Currently balloons communicate using unlicensed 2.4 and 5.8 Ghz bands<ref>{{cite web|title=How Loon Works|url=http://www.google.com/loon/how/|work=Google|accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref>, and Google claims that the setup allows it to deliver "speeds comparable to [[3G]]" to users. It is unclear how well technologies that rely on short communications times or [[Ping (networking utility)|pings]], such as [[Voice over IP|VoIP]], will work given that the signal may have to relay through multiple balloons before reaching the wider Internet.<ref name="NS 2013-06-20"> {{cite web|last=Hodson|first=Hal|title=Google's Project Loon to float the internet on balloons|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23721-googles-project-loon-to-float-the-internet-on-balloons.html|work=New Scientist|date=18 June 2013|accessdate=20 June 2013}}</ref>

The first person to connect to the "Google Balloon Internet" after the initial test balloons were launched into the stratosphere was a farmer in the town of [[Leeston]], New Zealand, who was one of 50 people in the area around Christchurch who agreed to be a pilot tester for Project Loon. The New Zealand farmer lived in a rural location that couldn't get broadband access to the Internet, and had used a satellite Internet service in 2009, but found that he sometimes had to pay over $1000 per month for the service. The locals knew nothing about the secret project, but allowed project workers to attach a basketball-sized receiver resembling a giant bright-red Google map pin to an outside wall of their property in order to connect to the Internet.<ref name="AP 2013-06"/>

The high-altitude balloons fly twice as high as airplanes, but below the range of satellites.<ref name="AFP 2013-06"/> Each balloon provides Internet service for an area that covers about {{convert|1250|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name="AP 2013-06"/>

== Equipment ==
[[File:Google Loon - Launch Event.jpg|thumb|A Project Loon research balloon]]

The [[Balloon (aircraft)#As flying machines|balloon envelopes]] used in the project are made by Raven Aerostar,<ref>{{cite web|title=Project Loon: Raven Aerostar - Google Collaboration|url=http://ravenaerostar.com/about/project-loon-raven-aerostar-google|work=Raven Aerostar|accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref> and are composed of [[polyethylene]] plastic about 3 [[thousandth of an inch|mil]] or {{convert|0.076|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick. The balloons are [[superpressure balloon]]s filled with [[helium]], and stand {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} across and {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall when fully inflated.<ref name="wired 2013-06"/> A small box weighing {{convert|10|kg|lb|abbr=on}} containing each balloon's electronic equipment hangs underneath the inflated envelope. This box contains [[printed circuit board|circuit boards]] that control the system, [[Antenna (radio)|radio antennae]] to communicate with other balloons and with Internet antennae on the ground, and [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] to store solar power so the balloons can operate during the night. Each balloon<U+2019>s electronics are powered by an array of [[solar panel]]s that sit between the envelope and the hardware. In full sun, the panels produce 100 watts of power, which is sufficient to keep the unit running while also charging a battery for use at night. A parachute attached to the top of the envelope allows for a controlled descent and landing when a balloon is ready to be taken out of service.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Loon Works|url=http://www.google.com/loon/how/|work=Google|accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref> In the case of an unexpected failure, the parachute deploys automatically.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kelion|first=Leo|title=Google tests balloons to beam internet from near space|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22905199|work=BBC News|date=15 June 2013|accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref> The balloons typically have a maximum life of about 55 days, although Google claims that its tweaked design can enable them stay aloft for more than 100 days.<ref name="NS 2013-06-20"/>
