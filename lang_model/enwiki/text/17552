'''Adam de Lanark,''' O.P. (died 1378) was a 14th century [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]] and [[prelate]]. Possibly from a [[Lanark]] burghess family, he was a Dominican and a priest by 1356, and by 1364 was  styled ''[[Master's degree|Magister]]'', indicating the completion of a long [[university education]].<ref name=Watt-325>Watt, ''Biographical Dictionary'', p. 325.</ref> He first appears in the sources, c. 1355/6 as a [[confessor]] of King [[David II of Scotland]]; he retained this royal position through the 1350s and into the 1360s; Adam received a number of English safe-conducts (between May 1356 and August 1357) to visit King David, who for a time was a prisoner in [[England]].<ref name=Watt-325/>

Adam spent a great deal of time at the papal court in [[Avignon]], [[France]]. He was there on 29 January 1359, as a [[proctor]] for [[Patrick Leuchars]], [[Bishop of Brechin]].<ref name=Watt-325/> He was sent there again at some point by the crown, receiving payment for this trip sometime between August 1362 and November 1364; he is not styled "bishop elect", meaning that this trip must have occurred before 1363.<ref>Watt, ''Biographical Dictionary'', pp. 325-6.</ref> In 1363, Adam de Lanark was elected [[Bishop of Galloway]] and received papal provision to the vacant [[bishopric]] on 17 November 1363.<ref name=Watt-130>Watt, ''Fasti Ecclesiae'', p. 130.</ref> He was consecrated by 2 January 1364.<ref name=Watt-130/> While seeking confirmation at the papal court, he probably presented a roll of petitions on behalf of King David II and did receive a number of faculties in order to grant dispensations in the bishopric of Galloway.<ref name=Watt-326>Watt, ''Biographical Dictionary'', p. 326.</ref>

Bishop Adam's return to [[Scotland]] is signalled by the grant of safe-conduct through England issued to him on 20 February.<ref name=Watt-326/> Sometime before 25 January 1365, he was in Galloway witnessing a charter of [[Thomas Fleming, Earl of Wigtown]].<ref name=Watt-326/> He was a frequent attender of royal councils and parliaments until 1371, when his patron David II died and was replaced on the throne by David II's long-time rival, Robert Stewart, [[Earl of Strathearn]], who became [[Robert II of Scotland]].<ref name=Watt-326/> Bishop Adam is thereafter a harder figure to trace, and little more is known about his activities besides the fact that he is said to have died at the papal court in Avignon during the vacancy of the papacy; that is, Bishop Adam died between the death of [[Pope Gregory XI]] on 27 March 1378 and the consecration of [[Avignon Pope Clement VII]] on the following 31 October.<ref>Dowden, ''Bishops'', p. 363; Watt, ''Biographical Dictionary'', p. 326; Watt, ''Fasti Ecclesiae'', pp. 130-1.</ref>
