"'''Tuesday's Child'''" is the 38th episode of the [[Holby City (series 7)|seventh series]] of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[medical drama]] television series ''[[Holby City]]''. The episode was was written by [[Andrew Holden]] and directed by Simon Meyers, and premiered on [[BBC One]] on 5 July 2005. In "Tuesday's Child", registrar [[Diane Lloyd]] ([[Patricia Potter]]) travels to [[Ghana]] in an attempt to persuade consultant [[Ric Griffin]] ([[Hugh Quarshie]]) to return to [[Holby]] and save Holby City Hospital's [[general surgery]] ward. Ric deals with family issues, whilst trying to secure funding for his brother's clinic. 

The episode was filmed entirely on location in Ghana as part of the BBC's "Africa lives" season, exploring African culture for UK audiences. It was the second episode of ''Holby City'' filmed outside the UK, following a 2004 episode set in [[Paris]]. The serial continued to film one episode abroad annually until 2008, when BBC budget cuts curtailed further foreign filming. The ''Holby City'' crew spent five weeks in [[Elmina]], using members of the local community in supporting roles. One crew member contracted [[malaria]] during filming, and several more were hospitalised. Both Quarshie and Potter expressed their pride at being part of the episode, with Quarshie deeming it his best work for the series. [[Adrian Edmondson]] guest-starred as surgeon [[Abra Durant]], his first appearance in ''Holby City''. He proved so popular in the role that he was asked to return twice more in 2005, and continued to make appearances in the series until December 2008.

The episode was watched by 7.27 million viewers. It was the second most-watched programme on BBC One for the week of broadcast, and the fourth most-watched show across all channels. The episode's premise received some criticism prior to broadcast, however the episode itself was generally well-received by critics, and was praised by viewers in a 2006 report on the portrayal of Africa on British television.

==Plot==
Registrar Diane Lloyd flies to Ghana, hoping to persuade consultant Ric Griffin to return to Holby and save Holby City Hospital's general surgery ward from being subsumed into an expanded cardiothoracic ward. She finds Ric at odds with his brother Kumi (Danny Sapani), who runs a clinic. Ric wants to perform free operations, but Kumi is desperate for money to keep the clinic running.

Diane appeals to Ric to return to Holby, for the sake of his pregnant daughter [[Jess Griffin|Jess]] as well as the hospital, but Ric insists that he is needed in Ghana, and tells Diane to go home. She talks to Ric's mother, Paulina (Abigail Kubeka), who reveals that Ric had a strained relationship with his father, and did not attend his funeral after twenty years of estrangement. She also meets Ric's friend Percy "Abra" Durant (Adrian Edmondson), who pries as to the nature of her relationship with Ric, and flirts with Diane.

Ric meets with an old school friend, Kwame Attakora (Fred Nii Amugi), now a successful local businessman. He attempts to persuade him to invest in the clinic, but Kwame, aware of Ric's family trouble in England, doubts his commitment. Ric is furious with Kumi for telling Kwame about his problems, but Kwame states that he could not deceive him, and that Ric is does not understand Ghanian honour. Without Kwame's support, the clinic goes bankrupt and Kumi chains the doors closed.

Travelling to the airport for her flight home, Diane and Ric come across a woman in labour, Joanna (Akofa Edjeani Asiedu), who is also suffering from malaria and having trouble breathing. It is unlikely she will survive a natural childbirth, and the nearest hospital is two hours away. They travel back to Kumi's clinic, collecting an inebriated Abra along the way. After Abra threatens to force entry, Kumi unchains the doors and they manage to deliver the baby and save Joanna.

As Diane has missed her flight, she suggests to Ric that they visit his father's grave. At the graveside, Ric tells Diane about his troubled relationship with his father, and confesses that he has feelings for her. They see a woman nearby who Diane recognises, having seen Paulina giving her money the day before. Ric confronts her, and discovers she is Esi Griffin (Gloria Acheampong), his father's last wife and widow. She has a son who is not in school, but will not explain her circumstances and tells Ric to speak to Kumi.

Ric confronts his brother about Esi, and Kumi tells him that their father died of [[AIDS]], but the family kept it secret to avoid bringing shame on themselves. Because of her relationship with his father, Esi is also [[HIV positive people|HIV positive]]. Ric confides in Diane, who attempts to kiss him, but Ric tells her to go home to her husband [[Owen Davis|Owen]]. She asks him to return with her, but Ric says he must stay in Ghana. Abra takes Diane to Kwame, and she pleads with him on Ric's behalf. They go to the clinic, where Kwame tells Ric he will provide the required funding, on the condition that Ric stays in Ghana. Ric agrees, and bids Diane goodbye as she returns to Holby.

Prior to the episode's broadcast, John McKie of the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' commented that in setting special editions of ''Holby City'', ''[[Ground Force]]'' and ''[[Rolf on Art]]'' in Africa, BBC controller [[Lorraine Heggessey]] was contradicting her desire to provide an alternative to negative coverage of the continent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/John+McKie+:+UNKINDEST+CUT+OF+THEM+ALL.-a0130893372|title=John McKie : Unkindest Cut of Them All|last=McKie|first=John|date=26 March 2005|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=7 August 2010|location=Glasgow}}</ref> The ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'' criticised the build<U+2013>up to the episode, writing that ''Holby City'' had abandoned its roots as a medical drama, concentrating instead on "wholly unbelievable" relationships between its main characters, with patient-care now incidental to inter-collegiate romances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/western-mail-cardiff-wales/mi_8001/is_2005_July_5/holby-city/ai_n37556071/?tag=content;col1|title=Holby City|date=5 July 2005|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=7 August 2010|location=Cardiff}}</ref>

The episode itself received positive reviews. Television critic [[Jim Shelley (TV critic)|Jim Shelley]] of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' called it "mad but brilliant",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133939577.html|title=Shelleyvision: Climbers and Sliders|last=Shelley|first=Jim|authorlink=Jim Shelley (TV critic)|date=12 July 2005|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref> and the ''[[Sunday Mercury]]'' selected the episode as recommended viewing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/sunday-mercury-birmingham-england/mi_7995/is_2005_July_3/soap-box-jumbo-dose-emotion/ai_n37554983/?tag=content;col1|title=Soap Box: Jumbo Dose of Emotion|date=3 July 2005|work=[[Sunday Mercury]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=7 August 2010|location=Birmingham}}</ref> Sarah Moolla of ''[[The People]]'' praised the episode for strengthening her "growing belief that ''Holby'' is becoming by far the best medical drama on TV". She called Ric and Diane two of the series' "strongest and most likeable characters", commenting that with the addition of nurses [[Donna Jackson]] ([[Jaye Jacobs]]) and [[Mickie Hendrie]] ([[Kelly Adams]]), it could be turned into a spin<U+2013>off series. Moolla felt that the episode could have been a "patronising ''Holby Goes Ghananas'' farce", like the Paris episode which she found "appalling [...] toe-curlingly bad", but instead deemed "Tuesday's Child" a "powerful, haunting and believable episode which you don't have to be a fan of the series to enjoy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/people-london-england-the/mi_7998/is_2005_July_3/tv-guide-box-donot/ai_n37554276/?tag=content;col1|title=TV Guide: Best on the Box; Don't miss!|last=Moolla|first=Sarah|date=3 July 2005|work=[[The People]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref>

"Reflecting the Real World", a 2006 report examining the portrayal of Africa on British television, found that "Tuesday's Child" was one of the most popular programmes amongst those shown to viewers, alongside a [[Channel 4]] documentary on AIDS and a BBC series following teachers and pupils in [[Uganda]]. Neera Dhingra of [[Voluntary Service Overseas]] (VSO), one of the organisations which commissioned the report, commented that, "The people who took part in our focus groups were very clear that they liked positive and transformative television, characters that they could relate to - basically good storytelling."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4871800.stm|title=So what does TV think of Africa?|last=Casciani|first=Dominic|date=4 April 2006|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref>
