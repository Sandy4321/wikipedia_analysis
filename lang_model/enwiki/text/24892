[[General]] '''Joseph <U+00C9>douard Jean Boyle''', [[Order of Military Merit (Canada)|CMM]], [[Canadian Forces Decoration|CD]] (born November 23, 1947) is a former [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Chief of Defence Staff]]. He resigned in disgrace less than a year after his appointment, when it was revealed that he was involved in "almost every facet" of the attempt to manage the aftermath of the [[Somalia Affair]], including the alteration of documents released to the media.<ref name="desb"/>

==Military history==
Boyle joined the military in 1967, and joined the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] as student #8790 and trained under Brigadier General [[William Kirby Lye]], whom he characterised as a "crusty old codger".<ref name="rmc"/><ref name="Jean Boyle"/> He spent his first year at school in [[Fort Champlain]], sharing a room with Brian D. Pashley, before moving on to spend his next three years living in the [[stone frigate]]; he participated in varsity [[football]], [[handball]] and [[judo]]. He graduated with his [[Honours degree]] in [[Economics]] in 1971.<ref name="rmc"/><ref name="Jean Boyle"/>

He returned to the RMC as Commandant in 1991 and served for two years.<ref name="Jean Boyle">http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=M1ARTM0010643 Jean Boyle</ref><ref name="rmc">[[Royal Military College]], [http://www.rmcclub.ca/everitaswp/?p=1716 Flashback: Jean Boyle]</ref>

As a jet fighter pilot, he commanded [[1 Canadian Air Division]] in Germany.<ref name="all"/>

In 1995, he was made a Commander of the [[Order of Military Merit (Canada)|Order of Military Merit]]. As a General, Boyle fought against Canada's participation in the [[Ottawa Treaty]] to ban [[landmine]]s.<ref>[[CBC]], [http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/03/13/landmines990313.html Canada's military tried to stop landmine ban], November 10, 2000</ref>

Boyle was appointed the [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Canada)|Chief of Defence Staff]] in January 1996, at the relatively young age of 48, being chosen ahead of more senior officers who were expected to be picked for the job.<ref name="post">Trueheart, Charles. [[Washington Post]], "Canada Can't Shake Somali Scandal; New Military Chief Quizzed on Troops' 1993 Torture-Killing", December 29</ref> General [[Lewis MacKenzie]] later described Boyle's ascension, noting that he was "obviously out of his depth as [Chief of Defence Staff]".<ref>MacKenzie, Lewis. "Soldiers Made Me Look Good", p. 271</ref> As the Somalian scandal was just breaking headlines, some suggested he was appointed specifically in the hopes that he would draw away the majority of public wrath onto himself.<ref>McCandless, Henry E. "A Citizen's Guide to Public Accountability", p. 64.</ref>

==Somalia affair==
Boyle was accused of overseeing the release of altered documents to an [[Access to Information]] request from [[CBC]] reporter [[Michael McAuliffe]]. It was later remarked that his error had been "almost ridiculously insignificant", as he had simply tried to evade persistent media questioning by providing altered documents.<ref name="desb"/> The military magazine [[Esprit de Corps (magazine)|Esprit de Corps]] labeled him "the [[spin doctor]] of the Somalia affair".<ref name="post"/> With nine days of testimony, he was the most vocal witness called before the subsequent inquiry, where he "fought determinedly to defend his reputation and save his job".<ref name="desb"/> 

While serving at [[National Defence Headquarters]], Boyle supervised the [[Media Liason Office]] and the [[Somalia Inquiry Liason Team]] which was in charge of delivery documents to the military inquiry.<ref name="desb"/> He filed a court motion seeking to forbid the inquiry from reaching any findings that would discredit him, but was unsuccessful.<ref>Mutimer, David. "Canadian Annual Review of Politics and Public Affairs", p. 88</ref>

On April 8, 1996 Boyle ordered the military to "stand down all but essential operations" to help conduct a search for files relating to Somalia that had not yet been provided to the Commission. Military planes were grounded, and 99% of staff; including military barbers and [[chaplain]]s, were asked to go through their files. The only noted exception was 1,000 peacekeeping troops serving in [[Bosnia]], about whom there were conflicting media reports whether they had been forced to stand down for the day to join the hunt. While the move was widely ridiculed by the media, it led to the inexplicable discovery of logbooks belonging to 2er Commando being found in a locked filing cabinet at [[CFB Petawawa]].<ref name="desb"/><ref>Report of the Somalia Commission of Inquiry, [http://www.forces.gc.ca/somalia/vol1/v1c14e.htm Problems with the production of documents]</ref><ref>[[CBC]], [http://archives.cbc.ca/war_conflict/peacekeeping/clips/4320/ Mea Culpa: Did you know?], August 14, 1996</ref><ref>[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]], "Military ridiculed over massive search for papers", April 11, 1996</ref><ref>Winsor, Hugh. [[The Independent]], [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/forces-inquiry-turns-to-farce-in-canada-1304255.html Forces inquiry turns to farce in Canada], April 11, 1996</ref><ref>Trueheart, Charles. [[Washington Post]], "Canadian Defense Authorities Hunt for Missing Papers; Military Scrutinized for Data on '93 Murder of Somali Youth by Members of Elite Unit", April 10, 1995</ref> On April 15, he arrived at the Commission's office, "tired and haggard", with previously-unseen documents which contradicted some of his earlier statements.<ref name="desb">Desbarats, Peter. "Somalia cover-up: A commissioner's journal", 1997</ref>

On August 12 1996, Boyle's first day of testimony before the inquiry, he mistakenly took the [[Bible]] in his left hand, when asked to place his right hand upon it; a gaffe noted by commissioner [[Peter Desbarats]].<ref name="desb"/> He was later recalled as handsome and confident, but criticised for appearing "tight-lipped and clenched" and providing "long and convoluted" answers to questions.<ref name="desb"/> The following day, he was noted to have absolved the media of any blame in the scandal, and agreed that the responsibility laid on the military itself.<ref name="desb"/><ref>Koring, Paul. [[Globe and Mail]], "Boyle breaks Somalia silence", August 13, 1996</ref> In late August, it was reported that Boyle had passed a [[polygraph]] test.<ref>Buse, Dieter K. "Whose National Security?", p. 201</ref>

Through most of the inquiry, Roberto Gonzalez had maintained that, as Director General of Public Affairs at NDHQ, he had no memory of providing Boyle information about the intention to alter documents in the Media Liaison Office, but that he "must have"; a stance which Boyle refuted.<ref name="desb"/> On September 10, 1996, Gonzalez announced that he had remembered the details of giving the information to Boyle, Assistant Deputy Minister [[Robert Fowler (diplomat)|Robert Fowler]] and Dr. Ken Calder - although there were questions about his credibility.<ref name="desb"/> Boyle was criticised for failing to take responsibility for any of his alleged actions, and instead "began to heap blame on his subordinates", angering other military leaders.<ref>Chun, Mae. [[New Straits Times]], "Poser over leadership in the military", October 5, 1996</ref>

The inquiry eventually found Boyle had "displayed poor and inadequate leadership" on three general allegations, that he had sought to provide misleading information on the military mission, that he had failed to take steps to support the inquiry's search for documents, and interact honestly with the liaison team set up to collect information.<ref name="small"/>

Interviewed by [[CTV]], Defence Minister [[David Collenette]] sought to correct those who suggested that he was strongly supporting Boyle. This gave commentators the view that he was distancing himself, to avoid being caught in the [[undertow]] of the scandal and survive with his political office intact.<ref name="desb"/> As Commissioner [[Peter Desbarats]] later summarised, it indicated "he perhaps has already decided to sacrifice Boyle in order to protect himself".<ref name="desb"/> When Collenette was forced to resign shortly afterwards, it was suggested that the government could not forgive Boyle "for endangering the Minister" and would leave him to figuratively fall on his own sword.<ref name="desb"/><ref>[[Macleans magazine]], [http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=M1ARTM0011009 Collenette resigns defence post], October 14, 1996</ref>

==Resignation and later life==
Following his resignation, Boyle began using the [[anglicized]] name ''John'' and joined [[Boeing International]], and served as Vice President of their International Business Development branch from 1997-99, and as Managing Director of their European arm from 2000-01.<ref name="rmc"/><ref>[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]], "Boeing sweetens bid to Israel", May 29, 1999.</ref><ref name="all">[[Business Wire]], [http://www.allbusiness.com/government/government-bodies-offices-government/5927739-1.html Simula Nominates General Jean - John - Boyle, ret., to Board of Directors], April 11, 2002</ref> Since his appointment to the Defence Firm came only three months after his resignation, the [[Ethics Commissioner]] was asked to investigate, but reported that all routes were properly pursued and there was no wrongdoing.<ref>[[Esprit de Corps]], "Boyle still an embarrassment to CF", March 1, 1997</ref>

In 1999, he was a [[guest speaker]] at the [[CANSEC]] [[arms bazaar]] in Ottawa.<ref>Sanders, Richard. Coalition to Oppose the Arms Trade, "Protest Arms Bazaar, Thurs. Sept 30"</ref>

In 1997, his son Michel graduated from RMC and joined the [[Communications Security Establishment]] foreign intelligence service.<ref name="rmc"/>

In 2002, he was named to the [[board of directors]] of military contractor [[Simula Incorporated]].<ref name="all"/> In 2003, Boyle spoke at a Freedom and Privacy convention hosted by [[BT Group]], and gave a presentation on how a "bad [Freedom of Information] decision" had led to the resignation of both himself and Collenette and became an election issue; leading to a warning that the United Kingdom "will be at the same stage as Canada" within three years.<ref>Aldersgate Consultants, Freedom & Privacy, [http://www.aldersgatepartners.com/issue_1/BT%20Conference.pdf BT's conference on the Freedom of Information Act], August 1, 2003</ref>

On August 18, 2005 he was elected to the board of directors for [[Liska Biometry]], and resigned March 8, 2006.<ref>Liska Biometry, [http://www.hotstocked.com/companies/l/liska-biometry-inc-LSKA-description-54194.html Description of Business]</ref> Four months later, he was named to the Advisory Board of [[Meta4hand]].<ref>Meta4hand, [http://www.meta4hand.com/release/news.php?id=27 Retired General Jean Boyle joins Meta4hand Advisory Board], July 10, 2006</ref>

He currently serves as the Canadian head of the Spectrum Group defence consultants, and [[CEO]] of JEBtek, a Canadian business consulting group.<ref name="bluebear">Blue Bear Law Enforcement Services, [http://www.bb-les.ca/Board.aspx Board of Directors]</ref>
