The '''Blue Bell''' is at 63<U+2013>65 Northgate Street, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England ({{gbmapping|SJ404666}}).  It is a Grade&nbsp;I [[listed building]].<ref name=images>{{Citation |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=470353 |title=Images of England: Nos 63 & 65 (formerly Old Bluebell Inn)|publisher=[[English Heritage]] | accessdate= 15&nbsp;August 2009}}</ref>  Originally it consisted of two [[Middle Ages|medieval]] houses which were joined together in the 18th&nbsp;century.  The pavement runs through the ground floor storey of the northern part of the building, leaving a separate cabin or chamber between the pavement and the road. 

==History==
The building dates from the mid to late 15th&nbsp;century<ref name=images/> and is said to be the oldest surviving intact [[Middle Ages|medieval]] house in Chester.<ref name=morris>{{Citation | last = Morris| first = Richard| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | publication-date = | date = | year = 1993| title = The Buildings of Chester| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = Dover| place = | publisher = Alan Sutton| pages = | page = 92| id = | isbn = 0-7509-0255-8| doi = | oclc = | url = | accessdate =}}</ref>  It was originally two houses, which were joined in the 18th&nbsp;century.  It formed part of Lorimer's Row, a group of buildings with an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] at ground level, as distinct from the [[Chester Rows|Rows]] in the centre of the city whose walkways are at the first floor level.<ref name=images/><ref name=ccc/>  From an early date, the south part of the building has been an [[inn]], its first [[license]] to sell alcohol possibly dating from 1494.<ref name=ccc/>  The separate cabin or chamber has been used for a number of functions; these include being a ticket office for [[Stagecoach|stage coach]] operators in the 18th&nbsp;century and in the 20th&nbsp;century a [[soda fountain]] bar and a [[barber]]'s shop.<ref name=ccc/>  In the 19th&nbsp;century the southern part of the building was an inn while the northern part housed a shop.<ref name=images/>  The inn closed in the 1930s.  In 1948 the building was used as an [[antique]] shop but its condition deteriorated so much that it was threatened with demolition.  In the 1950s the Chester Civic Trust campaigned for its survival, it was restored, and has since been used as a clothes shop and, more recently, as a restaurant.<ref name=ccc>{{Citation | url = http://www.virtualchester.org/view/view_location.php?id=36| title = Blue Bell Inn| accessdate = 15&nbsp;August 2009| publisher = Chester City Council}}</ref>

==Architecture==

The building is [[timber framing|timber-framed]] on a [[sandstone]] [[plinth]] with brickwork added later which has subsequently been [[Stucco|rendered]] and painted.  The roofs are of grey [[slate]]s.  The two buildings comprising the whole have separate frames each with roofs leading to [[gable]]s over the street.  At ground level the southern part of the building has an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] open to the street with a [[Pier (architecture)|pier]] to the south and an octagonal [[column]] south of the centre.  The northern part has a separate cabin or chamber adjacent to the street with the walkway between its rear and the rest of the building. On the street side of the chamber is a three-pane [[Cant (architecture)|canted]] [[oriel window]] and a door.  On the upper floor each part of the building has a horizontal window with a small one-paned window between them.<ref name=images/>
