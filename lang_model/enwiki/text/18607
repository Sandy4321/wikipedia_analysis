'''Emotional dysregulation''' ('''ED''') is a term used in the [[mental health]] community to refer to an [[emotion]]al response that is poorly modulated, and does not fall within the conventionally accepted range of emotive response.  ED may be referred to as '''labile mood''' (marked fluctuation of mood)<ref name="Beauchaine, T., Gatzke-Kopp, L., Mead, H., 2007">Beauchaine, T., Gatzke-Kopp, L., Mead, H., (2007). Polyvagal Theory and developmental psychopathology: Emotion dysregulation and conduct problems from preschool to adolescence. ''Biological Psychology'', ''74'', 174-184.</ref> or '''mood swings'''.

Possible manifestations of emotional dysregulation include [[angry]] outbursts or behavior outbursts such as destroying or throwing objects, aggression towards self or others, and threats to kill oneself. These variations usually occur in seconds to minutes or hours. Emotional dysregulation can lead to behavioral problems and can interfere with a person's social interactions and relationships at home, in school, or at place of employment.

Emotional dysregulation can be associated with an experience of early [[psychological trauma]], brain injury, or chronic maltreatment (such as [[child abuse]], [[child neglect]], or [[institutional abuse|institutional neglect/abuse]]), and associated disorders such as [[reactive attachment disorder]].<ref>[[Daniel Schechter]], Erica Willheim (2009).

This is manifested biologically by deficits in the frontal cortices of the brain.<ref>Treatment of Aggression, Anger and Emotional Dysregulation in Borderline Personality Disorder - ClinicalTrials.gov.

==Etymology==
The word "dysregulation" is a neologism created by combining the prefix "dys-" to "regulation"  According to ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'', dys- has various roots.  With [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots, it is akin to [[Old English]] ''t<U+014D>-'', ''te-'' "apart" and in [[Sanskrit]] ''dus-''" bad, difficult."

==Child psychopathology==
There are links between child emotional dysregulation and later [[psychopathology]].<ref>{{cite journal | title=The child behavior checklist dysregulation profile predicts adolescent DSM-5 pathological personality traits 4 years later | author=Elien De Caluw<U+00E9>, Mieke Decuyper and Barbara De Clercq | journal=European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry |date=July 2013 | volume=22, Issue 7, pp 401-411 | issue=7 | pages=401<U+2013>411}}</ref> For instance, ADHD symptoms are associated with problems with emotional regulation, motivation, and arousal.<ref>Barkley, R.

==Symptoms==
Smoking, [[self-harm]], eating disorders, and addiction have all been associated with emotional dysregulation.<ref name="Macklem, G.L. 2008">Macklem, G.L.(2008).

===Early childhood===
Research has shown that failures in emotional regulation may be related to the display of acting-out, or externalizing, behavior problems. When presented with challenging tasks, children who were found to have defects in emotional regulation (high risk) spent less time attending to tasks and more time throwing tantrums or fretting than children without emotional regulation problems (low risk). These high risk children had difficulty with self regulation and had difficulty complying with requests from caregivers and were more defiant.<ref>Calkins, S. D., & Dedmon, S. A. (2000). Physiological and behavioral regulation in two-year-old children with aggressive/destructive behavior problems. Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology.</ref> Emotional dysregulation has also been associated with childhood social withdrawal.<ref>Garcia<U+2013>Coll, C., Kagan, J., & Reznick, J. (1984). Behavioral inhibition in young children, Child Development, 55, 505<U+2013>529.</ref> Common signs of emotional dysregulation in early childhood include: isolation, throwing things, screaming, lack of eye contact, refusing to speak, rocking, running away, crying, dissociating, high levels of anxiety, or inability to be flexible.

===Internalizing behaviors===
Emotional dysregulation in children can be associated with internalizing behaviors including <ref name="Macklem, G.L. 2008"/>
*exhibiting emotions too intense for a situation
*difficulty calming down when upset
*difficulty decreasing negative emotions 
*being less able to calm themselves
*difficulty understanding emotional experiences
*becoming avoidant or aggressive when dealing with negative emotions 
*experiencing more negative emotions

===Externalizing behaviors===
Emotional dysregulation in children can be associated with externalizing behaviors including <ref name="Macklem, G.L. 2008"/>
*exhibiting more extreme emotions 
*difficulty identifying emotional cues 
*difficulty recognizing their own emotions
*focusing on the negative
*difficulty controlling their attention 
*being impulsive
*difficulty decreasing their negative emotions 
*difficulty calming down when upset

==Protective factors==
Early experiences with caregivers can lead to differences in emotional regulation. The responsiveness of a caregiver to an infant<U+2019>s signals can help an infant regulate their emotional systems. Caregiver interaction styles that overwhelm a child or that are unpredictable may undermine emotional regulation development. Effective strategies involve working with a child to support developing self control such as modeling a desired behavior rather than demanding it.<ref name="Bronson M. B. 2000">Bronson M. B. (2000). Self-regulation in early childhood. New York: Guilford Press.</ref>
The richness of environment that a child is exposed also helps development of emotional regulation. An environment must provide appropriate levels of freedom and constraint. The environment must also allow opportunities for a child to practice self regulation. A social environment that allows opportunities to practice social skills without overstimulation or excessive frustration helps a child develop their self regulation skills.<ref name="Bronson M. B. 2000"/>
