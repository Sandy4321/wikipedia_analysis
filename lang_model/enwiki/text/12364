== Plot ==
During the political realm of [[N. T. Rama Rao]], Shankar Narayana is an independent [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLA]] of the constituency of Shankar Nagar, which is named after him, in Hyderabad, and is regarded as a champion for the poor. When a truck collides with the car his brother Satyam and he are in, Shankar goes into a coma. Except his family, everyone else presumes that he is killed in the accident. His son Ajay is a police officer in Mumbai who fights against the mafia and is on a mission to apprehend [[American Mafia|Mafia]] don Nayak who is involved in [[illegal drug trade]], [[extortion]] and [[arms trafficking]]. 

When he heads to Turkey in an undercover operation, he meets Prashanthi, the daughter of Ajay's senior police officer and soon falls in love with her. She initially rejects his advances which makes him give up. However, he is successful in the undercover operation and arrests Nayak's brother Bunty. After returning to India, he again meets Prashanthi and, to his surprise, she reciprocates his feelings. In an attempt to arrest Nayak, Bunty and the police commissioner is killed and Shankar's loyal follower Sivayya reveals to Ajay that Nayak, along with Shankar's rival, Mallesh Goud, and Shankar's other followers Meka Narsingh Rao and Ambarpet Ganesh, were behind Shankar's accident, which makes Ajay plot to kill all of them.

When Shankar comes out of the coma, the doctors who treated him advise his family that his life is at risk if he encounters or hears anything upsetting, disturbing or shocking. Ajay hides the events surrounding the accident and shifts his family to his previously abandoned mansion which is now being used for film making. Ajay creates a dummy political set-up at this mansion. In the guise of a reality television program, Ajay tricks an aspiring but unsuccessful film actor Padmasri by making him believe that the television show is being sponsored by actor Akkineni Nagarjuna's television channel, and that Nagarjuna wants to offer Padmasri very high remuneration for his realistic performance in the show. On the other hand, an aspiring actor Bokka Venkata Rao and Mallesh Goud are tricked by Ajay with a real estate business deal to exploit his criminal nexus.

Ajay keeps this drama under wraps from Shankar by making him believe that Ajay is also an MLA revered by people fulfilling his dad's wishes. He marries Prashanthi after gaining her family's consent much to Shankar's delight. Meanwhile Ajay manages to kill Ganesh and Mallesh without the knowledge of anybody while Shankar believes that they died due to ailments. Nayak reaches Hyderabad to kill Ajay and Ajay's drama is exposed before everybody except Shankar. Meka Narsingh Rao is killed by Nayak while the latter's henchmen is killed by Ajay and others in an encounter. Nayak is later killed in a [[Ramlila]] event. Shankar too comes to know about Ajay's drama and is happy for the affection his son showed on him.

{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="It was our idea to coin an idea as grand as a ''[[Magadheera]]'' (2009). It later dawned upon us that the heavy dose backdrop would not only not suit the span of the hero but also would not have scope for usual Srinu Vaitla elements like comedy.

Then we came up with a love story. In fact, Mahesh Babu liked the idea and gave the nod. He said he wanted to do a full-fledged love story. Even we liked to do such a story because we never did a romantic story of that kind after ''[[Anandam]]'' (2001).

However, we felt that it lacked elements like action. The producers too wanted the story with its share of action.

== Themes and influences ==
Few critics said that the film's story is inspired by the German [[tragicomedy]] film ''[[Good Bye, Lenin!]]'' (2003). Regarding the same, Vaitla said "I saw ''Good Bye, Lenin!'' when the scripting of ''Dookudu'' was 50 per cent complete. It was a coincidence. I had the idea of showing Mahesh in a new way as a young [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]]. I also had the idea of the father. Then, [[Gopimohan]] came in, and we worked on the script for seven months. It's a multi-layered film and writing the screenplay for it was tough." He added that the idea of how lies are told and you get people to believe them was already shown in his earlier film ''[[Ready (2008 film)|Ready]]'' (2008).<ref name="Rediff int"/>

He chose father-son relationship in the film as he wanted to show the emotions between them. Apart from that, Vaitla was inspired by other small things from ''Good Bye, Lenin!''.<ref name="Rediff int"/> One such inspired sequence is where the protagonist and his team create fake news broadcasts & newspapers for showing them to his father in order to make the drama believable which includes making [[N. T. Rama Rao]] the president of India in 2011. And, the scene where the protagonist lies to his father about few things without knowing that the latter is aware of the drama is inspired from the climax of ''Good Bye, Lenin!''.

A reviewer from ''[[Sify]]'' felt that some of the scenes and characters are inspired by Mahesh's previous films ''[[Athadu]]'' (2005) and ''[[Pokiri]]'' (2006) apart from the Hindi film ''[[Patiala House (film)|Patiala House]]'' (2011).<ref name="Sify Review"/> In one of the comedy scenes in the film, M. S. Narayana is seen performing spoofs of the films ''[[Yamadonga]]'' (2007), ''[[Magadheera]]'' (2009), ''[[Simha (film)|Simha]]'' (2010) and ''[[Enthiran]]'' (2010).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/140803/entertainment-tollywood/article/spoof-specialist|title=The spoof specialist|last=Kavirayani|first=Suresh|publisher=''[[Deccan Chronicle]]''|date=3 August 2014|accessdate=27 December 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20141227075044/http://www.deccanchronicle.com/140803/entertainment-tollywood/article/spoof-specialist|archivedate=27 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0etq5Nn4KAo|title=Dookudu Comedy Scene 15 : M.S.Narayana Showreel imitating NTR,Ram Charan & Balakrishna|work=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[MAA TV]]|date=17 July 2013|accessdate=27 December 2014}}</ref>

=== Legal issues ===
The film was shot at Vikarabad Railway Station on 31 July 2011 after seeking necessary permission to film the sequences till 5:00 PM with police security. The film's shoot was called off because of rain and Mahesh left the premises at 4:30 PM. Shortly, seven Telangana Students JAC activists landed at the railway station raising slogans against Samaikhyandra supporters. On seeing them, the crew started preparing to vacate the spot. While they were leaving, the activists started pelting stones at them. Police later dispered the mob and production manager Rambabu and Ramesh filed a complaint against them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Movie-crew-attacked/articleshow/9436084.cms|title=Movie crew attacked|author=TNN|publisher=''The Times of India''|date=1 August 2011|accessdate=29 December 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20141229022840/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Movie-crew-attacked/articleshow/9436084.cms|archivedate=29 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmibeat.com/telugu/news/2011/mahesh-babu-dookudu-crew-attacked-010811.html|title=Mahesh Babu's Dookudu crew attacked!|author=Ramchander|publisher=Oneindia Entertainment|date=1 August 2011|accessdate=29 December 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20141229023029/http://www.filmibeat.com/telugu/news/2011/mahesh-babu-dookudu-crew-attacked-010811.html|archivedate=29 December 2014}}</ref>

The activists disrupted the screening of the film in six theaters in Ranga Reddy district and accused the unit members for registering false cases against them during the film's shoot at railway station. They entered theaters at Vikarabad, Parigi, Tandoor, Chevella and Shamshabad and asked the managements not to screen the film but were dispersed by the police.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Suresh Kavirayani of ''[[The Times of India]]'' rated the film 4 out of 5 and wrote "''Dookudu'' is a typical Srinu Vytla film with a generous sprinkling of comedy. His narrative manages to keep the audience engaged until the end of the movie. This movie comes as a blessing for not just Mahesh Babu, but also for Tollywood, which is badly in need of a hit, after the recent spate of box office debacles. Srinu Vytla and Mahesh Babu have come out with a winner in ''Dookudu''".<ref name="TOI Review">{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movie-reviews/Dookudu/movie-review/10093005.cms|title=Dookudu movie review|last=Kavirayani|first=Suresh|publisher=''The Times of India''|date=24 September 2011|accessdate=27 December 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20141227072651/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movie-reviews/Dookudu/movie-review/10093005.cms|archivedate=27 December 2014}}</ref> ''Bollywood Life'' stated "''Dookudu'' has all the elements of a potboiler <U+2013> the unholy nexus between underworld and politicos, passionate romance, shrill revenge and the glory of father-son relationship.
