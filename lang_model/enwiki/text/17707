==Plot==
On a flat bed lorry driven in the streets of [[London, England]], a motor car is under a gray cover with the initials RR. The [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls Royce]] is first purchased by Lord Charles, the Marquess of Frinton ([[Rex Harrison]]) as a 10th wedding anniversary present for his French wife, Eloise ([[Jeanne Moreau]]). Frinton is Under Secretary of State at the [[Foreign Office]]. The marquess is a longtime horse owner who has his heart set on winning the [[Ascot Gold Cup]]. This year his horse, named June 10 (his wedding anniversary date) is the favourite and does indeed win. Lord Frinton is presented the Gold Cup by King [[George V]]. However, his elation is blighted when he finds his wife with her lover and his underling, John Fane ([[Edmund Purdom]]) in the back of the Rolls with the shades drawn. For appearance's sake, Lord Frinton will not divorce his wife, but he returns the car.

''20,023 miles later, [[Genoa]], Italy'' <U+2014> The Rolls according to G. Bomba, owner of the Genova Auto Salon was <U+201C>owned by a Marajah, who lost his money at the [[San Remo]] Casino.<U+201D> The Rolls is purchased from Bomba, by American gangster Paolo Maltese ([[George C. Scott]]). He is touring Italy with his [[engagement|fianc<U+00E9>e]] Mae Jenkins ([[Shirley MacLaine]]) and his right-hand man Joey Friedlander ([[Art Carney]]).  When Maltese returns to the United States to take care of some unsavory business, he leaves Joey to chaperone Jenkins. Friedlander turns a blind eye when she falls in love with Stefano ([[Alain Delon]]), a handsome young [[street photography|street photographer]]. Jenkins and Stefano are in the back of the Rolls with the shades drawn, Friedlander walks away. Back at the hotel, Friedlander shows Jenkins an eight-day-old American newspaper headline, ''Bugs O<U+2019> Leary Slain<U+2014>Police Claim Gang Warfare'', that was Paolo<U+2019>s business in the United States. However, when Paolo rejoins them, Jenkins lies to Stefano, telling him that it was just a fling, in order to protect him from her lethal boyfriend.

''[[Trieste]] on the Yugoslav border <U+2013> the year, 1941'' <U+2014> The Rolls is in a repair shop. The car exterior is filthy with ''OCCASIONE'' (Opportunity) painted in white letters on the front windscreen. The paint on the hood (bonnet) is partially gone. The new owner of the car is Gerda Millett ([[Ingrid Bergman]]), a bossy, wealthy American widow touring Europe. During the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia]] by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Germans]], patriot Davich ([[Omar Sharif]]) commandeers her automobile to sneak into the country. However, none of his men know how to drive, so Millett volunteers, much to Davich<U+2019>s surprise. They survive a German [[airstrike|aerial attack]] and reach their destination. Along the way, the two very different people fall in love. Millett and Davich get in the back of the Rolls and draw the shades down. She wants to stay and help repel the invaders, but Davich will not permit it, saying it is not her fight. He tells her to go back to America and tell people what she has witnessed. The car will return with Millett to the United States. The car is seen being unloaded from a cargo ship in New York. During the end credits, as the car is seen on the expressway, a road sign, ''I-95, George Washington Bridge, Bronx <U+2013> Next Right.''

==Reception==
The film's reviews were "tepid," but it performed "respectably" at the box office.<ref name="tcm"/> According to ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', "anyone willing to be taken for a smooth ride could hardly find a more sumptuous vehicle, star-studded, gold-plated, shock-proof and probably critic-proof, too."<ref name="tcm"/>  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called it an "elegant, old-fashioned movie about roadside sex" that "looks worn at times," but is "always appropriately overprivileged in high-powered personalities and spectacular sets."<ref name="time65"/> ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it a "pretty slick vehicle, that is pleasing to the eye and occasionally amusing, but it hardly seems worthy of all the effort and the noted personalities involved."<ref name="nyt65"/>

The film grossed $5.4 million at the U.S. box office, among the top ten films in box office receipts for 1965, a year in which ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' topped the list with $28.5 million.<ref name="time66"/>  The film's producers also benefited financially from television's willingness to pay studios more for more timely broadcasting rights to new films: ''The Yellow Rolls-Royce'' got its television premiere on CBS<ref name="time67-10"/> in fall 1967.<ref name="time67-06"/>
