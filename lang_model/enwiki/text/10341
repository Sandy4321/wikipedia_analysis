'''United States House of Representatives, Michigan District 1''' is a [[United States]] [[Congressional district]] containing the entire [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]] as well as part of the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]]. Currently the district is represented by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Bart Stupak]], who has been the representative since 1993. Prior to 1993, the district covered part of the [[metropolitan Detroit]] area. 

== Geography ==
The district is the second-largest congressional district in land mass east of the [[Mississippi River]]. Its boundaries contain much of the northeastern part of the Lower Peninsula in addition to the entire Upper Peninsula. Altogether, the district makes up about 44% of the land area of state of Michigan. It contains the second-longest shoreline of any district in the United States, behind the [[at-large]] district of [[Alaska]].

It contains all of 30 Michigan counties and a portion of a 31st, comprising almost three-eighths of the state's 83 counties.

==History==
[[Image:MI 1st congressional district (106th Congress).PNG|thumb|400px|right|The 1st district boundaries for the 106th Congress, prior to redistricting in 2002]]
The Michigan First District was located in Detroit until the 1992 election.  In that year Michigan lost two congressional districts and in the course of the redistricting process the remaining districts were renumbered.  As a result, the old 1st basically became the new 14th, while much of the old 11th District became the new 1st District.

The 1st from 1992<U+2013>2002 was similar to the modern district, except that it did not go nearly as far south along [[Lake Huron]], while it took in [[Traverse City]] and some surrounding areas on the west side of the state.
