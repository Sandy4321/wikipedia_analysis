Early in his career, Usher spent ten years teaching courses part time at the University of Pittsburgh's [[Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business]] as well as undergraduate and graduate classes in industrial engineering at the university's [[Swanson School of Engineering]].<ref name="PittMag"/>

In 1990, Usher was elected President of U.S. Steel Group and Director of USX, which had changed its name from U.S. Steel in 1986, and President and Chief Operating Officer of USX in 1994.<ref>{{cite newspaper | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/03/business/business-people-usx-steel-s-new-head-sees-steady-demand.html | title=Business People: USX Steel's New Head Sees Steady Demand | first=Jonathan | last=Hicks | date=1990-10-03 | newspaper=The New York Times | location=New York, NY | accessdate=2009-12-18}}</ref> He became Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer effective in 1995, which provided him oversight of USX's oil and energy businesses. 

Usher has been credited with turning around and leading U.S. Steel through a difficult period in the steel industry.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wll9WqFHv0sC&lpg=PT119&ots=cMIUaKOT3m&dq=thomas%20j.%20usher&pg=PT119#v=onepage&q=&f=false | pages=111<U+2013>120 | title=Strategy Power Plays: How the World's Most Strategic Minds Reach the Top of Their Game |  last=Business Week | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2007| ISBN=0-07-147560-5 | location=New York, NY | accessdate=2009-12-18}}</ref> His success in leading U.S. Steel during this period has in part been credited to his initiation of significant changes, including the separation of Marathon Oil and U.S. Steel at the end of 2001, a move designed to allow both companies to focus on their core businesses. His success has also been credited to his expansion of U.S. Steel by leading it to purchase operations in [[Slovakia]] and [[Serbia]], which took the previously domestic U.S. Steel international, as well as consolidating the industry through acquisitions and integrations, such as that of [[National Steel Corporation]]. By the end of his tenure as CEO, U.S. Steel had more than doubled in size.<ref name="Southpointe">{{cite journal | url=http://www.southpointe-ceo.org/newsletter/1st2007.pdf | title=Can You Teach People To Be Leaders?
