==Lawsuits==
===Trademark infringement lawsuits against Mars Inc===
[[Mars Incorporated]] created a short animation of the Blue [[M&M's]] character playing a guitar while dressed in a white cowboy hat, cowboy boots and underpants on the electronic animation display that hangs outside the M&M'S store at Times Square. Burck, who owns registered trademarks to the Naked Cowboy name and likeness, filed a [[trademark infringement]] lawsuit against Mars Incorporated on February 15, 2008.<ref>[http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2008/02/13/the-naked-cowboy-sues-the-naked-mm/?mod=googlenews_wsj "The Naked Cowboy Sues the Naked M&M"] by Slater, Dan, ''The Wall Street Journal'', February 13, 2008</ref> 

Burck alleges that the ads infringe on his trademark by "using his likeness, persona, and image for commercial purposes without his written permission and by falsely suggesting that he endorses M&M'S candy."<ref>[http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2008/02/15/naked-cowboys-lawsuit-drives-mm-outta-dodge/ The Wall Street Journal Law Blog, "Cowboy's Lawsuit Drives M&M Out of Dodge", February 15, 2008]</ref>  The Cowboy<U+2019>s lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, requests an injunction stopping Mars from using the Naked Cowboy<U+2019>s likeness to advertise M&M<U+2019>s products, up to $100 million in [[punitive damages]], and attorney's fees.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/06/24/naked.cowboy/index.html Middleton, Ekin, "'Naked Cowboy' can sue makers of M&Ms"]</ref> On June 23, 2008, the court issued a decision [http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2008cv01330/320985/20/0.swf that dismissed a portion of the suit relying on New York law but rejected a motion by the defendants to dismiss the trademark claims]. In a filing dated November 7, 2008, both Mars Incorporated and Burck agreed and stipulated that the action be dismissed with prejudice, with each party bearing his own costs and attorney's fees. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.<ref>[http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Naked.Cowboy.M.2.859547.html "Naked Cowboy, Mars Inc. End M&M Ad Dispute"]</ref>
