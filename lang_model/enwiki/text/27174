Kalimpong and neighbouring [[Darjeeling]] were major centres calling for a separate [[Gorkhaland]] state in the 1980s.

Kalimpong, located on a ridge overlooking [[River Teesta]], is a tourist destination owing to its temperate climate and proximity to popular tourist locations in the region. Horticulture is also important to Kalimpong: it has a flower market notable for its wide array of [[Orchidaceae|orchids]]; nurseries, which export Himalayan grown flower bulbs, tubers and rhizomes, contribute to the economy of Kalimpong.<ref name="General Information" /> Home to ethnic [[Nepali people|Nepali]]s, indigenous ethnic groups and non-native migrants from other parts of India, the town also is a religious centre of Buddhism. The Buddhist monastery [[Zang Dhok Palri Phodang]] holds a number of rare [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] scriptures.<ref name="Special: Kalimpong, West Bengal in Rediff">{{cite web|url=http://specials.rediff.com/getahead/2008/feb/08sld3.htm|title=Special: Kalimpong, West Bengal|publisher=[[Rediff]]|accessdate=2008-12-08}}</ref>

==Name origin==
The precise [[etymology]] of the name ''Kalimpong'' remains unclear. The most widely accepted origin of the name ''Kalimpong'' is "Assembly (or Stockade) of the King's Ministers" in [[Tibetan language|Tibetan]], derived from ''kalon'' ("King's ministers") and ''pong'' ("[[stockade]]"). It may also be derived from the translation "ridges where we play" from [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]], as it was known to be the region's traditional tribal gathering for summer sporting events. People from the hills also call the area ''Kalibong'' ("the black spurs").<ref name="Kalimpong Etymology">{{cite web|url=http://www.wb.nic.in/westbg/kalimpong2.html|title=Kalimpong Etymology|publisher=Government of West Bengal|accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref>

According to K.P. Tamsang, author of ''The Untold and Unknown Reality about the Lepchas'', the term Kalimpong is deduced from the name ''Kalenpung'', which in Lepcha means "Hillock of Assemblage";<ref name=kalidarjhist>{{cite web

==History==
[[Image:morganhouse.jpg|thumb|Morgan House is a classic example of colonial architecture in Kalimpong.]]
Until the mid-19th century, the area around Kalimpong was ruled in succession by the [[Sikkim]]ese and [[Bhutan]]ese kingdoms.<ref name="sikkimkalimpong">{{cite book|last=Gurung|first=Chanda|coauthors=Gurung, Nawraj|title=Social and Gender Analysis in Natural Resource Management|editor=Ronnie Vernooy|publisher=International Development Research Centre (Canada), NetLibrary, Inc|year=2006|pages=39<U+2013>43|chapter=The Social and Gendered Nature of Ginger Production and Commercialization|isbn=155250218X}}</ref><ref name=kalidarjhist/> Under Sikkimese rule, the area was known as ''Dalingkot''.<ref name="Next weekend you can be at ...

Kalimpong"/> Overlooking the Teesta Valley, Kalimpong is believed to have once been the forward position of the Bhutanese in the 18th century. The area was sparsely populated by the indigenous [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]] community and migrant [[Bhutia]] and [[Limbu people|Limbu]] tribes. Later in 1780, the [[Gurkha|Gorkha]]s invaded and conquered Kalimpong.<ref name="Next weekend you can be at ... Kalimpong" /> After the [[Anglo-Bhutan War]] in 1864, the Treaty of Sinchula (1865) was signed, in which Bhutanese held territory east of the [[Teesta River]] was ceded to the [[British East India Company]].<ref name=kalidarjhist/> At that time, Kalimpong was a hamlet, with only two or three families known to reside there.<ref name=tribunekalim>{{cite web

}}</ref> The first recorded mention of the town was a fleeting reference made that year by [[Ashley Eden]], a government official with the Bengal Civil Service. Kalimpong was added to district of Darjeeling in 1866. In 1866&ndash;1867 an Anglo-Bhutanese commission demarcated the common boundaries between the two, thereby giving shape to the [[Kalimpong subdivision]] and the Darjeeling district.<ref name="Gorkhaland Movement: A Study in Ethnic Separatism">{{cite book|first=Amiya K.

After the war, the region became a subdivision of the [[Western Duars]] district, and the following year it was merged with the district of Darjeeling.<ref name=kalidarjhist/> The [[Temperateness|temperate]] climate prompted the British to develop the town as an alternative hill station to [[Darjeeling]], to escape the scorching summer heat in the [[Indo-Gangetic plain|plains]]. Kalimpong's proximity to the [[Nathula]] and [[Jelepla]] passes, offshoots of the ancient [[Silk Road]], was an added advantage and it soon became an important trading outpost in the trade of [[fur]]s, [[wool]]s and food grains between India and Tibet.<ref name="khawaslhasa">{{cite news|title=The Forgotten Way: Recalling the road to Lhasa from Kalimpong|last=Khawas|first=Vimal|date=31 December 2004|work=[[The Statesman]]|publisher=The Statesman Ltd}}</ref> The increase in commerce attracted large numbers of migrants from Nepal, leading to an increase in population and economic prosperity.

The arrival of Scottish missionaries saw the construction of schools and welfare centres for the British.<ref name=tribunekalim/> Rev. W. Macfarlane in the early 1870s established the first schools in the area.<ref name=tribunekalim/> The Scottish University Mission Institution was opened in 1886, followed by the Kalimpong Girls High School. In 1900, Reverend J.A. Graham founded the [[Dr. Graham's Homes]] for destitute [[Anglo-Indian]] students.<ref name=tribunekalim/> By 1907, most schools in Kalimpong also started offering education to Indian students. By 1911, the population had swelled to 7,880.<ref name=tribunekalim/>

Following [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] in 1947, Kalimpong became part of the state of West Bengal, after Bengal was partitioned between India and [[Pakistan]]. With [[People's Republic of China|China's]] annexation of [[Tibet]] in 1959, many Buddhist monks fled Tibet and established monasteries in Kalimpong. These monks also brought many rare Buddhist scriptures with them. In 1962, the permanent closure of the Jelepla Pass after the [[Sino-Indian War]] disrupted trade between Tibet and India, and led to a slowdown in Kalimpong's economy. In 1976, the visiting [[Dalai Lama]] consecrated the [[Zang Dhok Palri Phodang]] monastery, which houses many of the scriptures.<ref name=tribunekalim/>

[[Image:Kalimpongkanchenjanga.jpg|thumb|Most large houses in Kalimpong were built during the British era. In the background is Mount Kanchenjunga.]]
Between 1986 and 1988, the demand for a separate state of [[Gorkhaland]] and [[Kamtapur]] based on ethnic lines grew strong. Riots between the [[Gorkha National Liberation Front]] (GNLF) and the West Bengal government reached a stand-off after a forty-day strike. The town was virtually under siege, and the state government called in the Indian army to maintain law and order. This led to the formation of the [[Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council]], a body that was given semi-autonomous powers to govern the Darjeeling district, except the area under the [[Siliguri subdivision]]. Since 2007, the demand for a separate Gorkhaland state has been revived by the [[Gorkha Janmukti Morcha]] and its supporters in the Darjeeling hills.<ref>{{cite web

The [[River Teesta]] flows in the valley below and separates Kalimpong from the state of Sikkim. The soil in the Kalimpong area is typically reddish in color.
