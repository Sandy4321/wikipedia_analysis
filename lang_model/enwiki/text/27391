'''Cristina Yang''' is a fictional character from the [[medical drama]] television series ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', which airs on the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) in the United States. The character was created by series producer [[Shonda Rhimes]], and is portrayed by actress [[Sandra Oh]]. Introduced as a [[Internship (medicine)|surgical intern]] at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, Yang worked her way up to [[Residency (medicine)|resident]] level, while her relationships with colleagues [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), [[George O'Malley]] ([[T. R. Knight]]), [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]), and [[Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]) formed a focal point of the series. Yang was once engaged to [[Preston Burke]] ([[Isaiah Washington]]), had a relationship with renowned surgeon Colin Marlow, and has since been wed to [[Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]). 

Oh originally auditioned for the role of [[Miranda Bailey]], although [[Chandra Wilson]] was ultimately cast in the part. Oh has received generally positive reviews for her portrayal, with Mark Perigard of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' considering her friendship with Meredith to be "the secret core of ''Grey's''". Oh has also garnered numerous awards and nominations for her role as Yang, including [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] and [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] wins in 2006. She was additionally nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]] in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. Characterized by ABC as "competitive", "ambitious", and "intelligent", the network also noted her weaknesses: "bossy", "aggressive", and "tactless". In May 2012, ''[[E! Online]]'' reported that Oh has signed on for two more years, along with her fellow cast members.

== Storylines ==
Cristina Yang is introduced as a fellow [[surgery|surgical]] [[Internship (medicine)|intern]] to [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]), [[George O'Malley]] ([[T.R. Knight]]), and [[Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]); the five of them working under [[Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]). An [[atheism|atheistic]] competitive intern from [[Judaism|Jewish]] ancestry, she watched her father bleed out and die at a young age. Yang also suffers from [[dyslexia]], and was raised in [[Beverly Hills]], [[California]]. On her first day, she hits it off with Meredith and the pair soon beomes best friends and each other's "person". She has a [[sexual encounter]] with chief of [[cardiothoracic surgery]] [[Preston Burke]] ([[Isaiah Washington]]) that leads her to being pregnant with his child, so she schedules an abortion without telling him about the pregnancy. However, Yang experiences an [[ectopic pregnancy]] and collapses when her left [[fallopian tube]] bursts; she then tells Burke. After Burke is shot in the arm and develops a hand tremor, Yang helps him to cover it up by developing a covert partnership. Yang initially denies involvement during a confrontation, but then confesses everything to [[Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens, Jr.]]), the chief of surgery. Yang's actions jeopardize Burke's chances of becoming chief, for which he sees as a huge betrayal. After a short breakup, Yang breaks the silence and Burke proposes marriage, which Yang accepts after eight days of hesitation. 

Afterward, Yang's ex-boyfriend, Colin Marlow, comes to Seattle Grace, trying to sabotage her relationship with Burke to win her back. Burke wanted a lavish wedding, but Yang was against it. However, she gives in to a fancy wedding. On their wedding day, she doubts it is the right decision, and after a brief hesitation to walk down the aisle, she enters before Burke calls off the wedding, realizing that he could not force Yang to do something she did not want to do. Thus, Yang went on her honeymoon to [[Hawaii]] with Meredith, and Burke moved away. Burke is replaced by [[Erica Hahn]] ([[Brooke Smith (actress)|Brooke Smith]]), who immediately dislikes Yang for her affairs with Marlow and Burke, refusing to let her scrub in on surgeries. Eventually, [[Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ramirez]]) moves in with Yang, and she still tries to earn Hahn's approval. Hahn reveals that she dislikes Yang because she reminds her of an early version of herself. Yang then doubts her skills when Seattle Grace is ranked at twelfth on a list of the best teaching hospitals, while still clashing with Hahn. She is then stabbed by a falling icicle, resulting in a minor injury. She sets her sights on [[Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]), who returned from [[Iraq]] as a [[trauma surgeon]], with whom she shares a brief kiss. When he returns as chief of [[trauma surgery]], Yang and him begin dating, but Hunt has repressed memories of his time in Iraq, leading her to see him in a new light. Due to his [[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]] (PTSD), Hunt subconciously tries to strangle her, which leads Yang to end their relationship as she is afraid of sleeping next to him. 

Soon after, Hunt begins seeing a therapist, and Yang confesses her love for him. Yang then becomes depressed with her lack of cardiothoracic surgeries, even telling Meredith she misses Burke. As a result, Hunt asks an ex-colleague from the Army, [[Teddy Altman]] ([[Kim Raver]]) to become the chief of cardiothoracic surgery as a "gift" for Yang. Altman is insulted by this, and considers leaving, but Yang convinces her to stay by telling her she can have Hunt back. Yang eventually decides to end their relationship once more due to Hunt not being able to decide who he loves. When Meredith's husband, [[Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]) is shot by a deceased patient's angry husband, Yang is forced to operate on him and eventually saves his life. She also rekindles her relationship with Hunt after he got shot. Following the shooting, the two decide to get married, and she refuses to return to work as a surgeon. Yang later returns to work, but collapses as a result of PTSD. Shepherd forces her through her issues by making her perform the same surgery she did on him to a cadaver, and after a push from Altman, she advocates the life of a [[lung transplant]] patient. However, Yang then blames Meredith for her trauma and quits her job at the hospital, stating even though she could be a surgeon she no longer wanted to. She takes a temporary bartending job at the Emerald City Bar, much to the shock of her colleagues. Shepherd helps her unintentionally to get back to work by talking to her during her housewarming party and going on a fishing trip where she felt other emotions besides fear. 

Yang decides to go for the position of Chief Resident, but her hopes are brought to a halt when Hunt is in charge of choosing. The position of Chief Resident is eventually given to [[April Kepner]] ([[Sarah Drew]]). Later, Yang discovers she is pregnant with Hunt's child, and decides to get an abortion. Though Hunt accompanies her to get aborted, he is extremely angry with her decision. Yang then operates on Henry Burton ([[Scott Foley]]), Altman's husband, unknown of his identity. When the surgery fails and he dies, Yang is guilt stricken upon learning of her patient's identity. She and Hunt distance themselves from each other as they keep fighting over the abortion, despite attending marriage counselling. Their marriage comes in serious trouble when Hunt has a [[one-night stand]] with a patient's friend, leaving Yang heartbroken. She decides to move on, unsure of her future with him. As the end of the fifth year of [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] is near, the surgical residents, including Yang, prepare for their [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|medical boards]] for the different fellowships they plan on joining. After she passes her exams, Yang reconciles with Hunt and tells him she is leaving Seattle for Mayo Clinic. Afterward, Yang, Meredith, Shepherd, [[Arizona Robbins]] ([[Jessica Capshaw]]), [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Mark Sloan]] ([[Eric Dane]]), and [[Lexie Grey]] ([[Chyler Leigh]]) are in an [[aviation accident]] while on the way to [[Boise, Idaho]] to perform surgery on conjoined twins. Lexie tragically dies, leaving the other surgeons alone with no sign of help on the way.

===Casting and creation===

On the creation of Yang, Rhimes said the character contained "a little bit of [her] personality".<ref name=OhAud>{{cite web|last=Oakley|first=Colleen|title=Interview with Shonda Rhimes|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/greys-anatomy|work=[[Marie Claire]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}</ref> Speaking with [[Oprah Winfrey]], Rhimes said: "Cristina was second, simply because she's the kind of woman I know really well, and I like her.

Discussing casting Oh as Yang, Rhimes said: "She brought this energy that felt very fresh. From the beginning, I've been shaping Cristina around Sandra a little bit. One of my favorite things to do is take as much of her dialogue out of a scene as possible because she does so much nonverbally. Then I just watch what she manages to do without having a word to say."<ref name=OhAud/> The character of Yang was not originally supposed to be of Asian descent. Oh said her character was "a pert little blonde and the thing is the woman who runs the show, Shonda Rhimes, is a black woman, which makes a big [expletive] difference."<ref name="New York Times">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/movies/17devr.html?_r=1&pagewanted=2 |last=De Vries |first=Hilary |title=All That Korean Rage, Unbottled |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=October 17, 2004 |accessdate=September 3, 2012}}</ref> 

In 2009, when asked why Oh signed on for ''Grey's Anatomy'', Oh said: "I'm very proud of this show and I think it came along at the right time for me. It's a changing time on television because five or ten years ago you wouldn't have a major network show where half of the cast were not white."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fanbolt.com/headline/7250/Interview:_Sandra_Oh_from_Grey%27s_Anatomy/page2 |title=Interview: Sandra Oh from Grey's Anatomy (Page 2) |publisher=''Fanbolt'' |date=24 September 2009 |accessdate=3 September 2012}}</ref> Oh's original contract with the show expired after [[Grey's Anatomy (season 8)|season eight]], however, ''[[E!

===Characterization===
The [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) characterized Yang as "competitive", "ambitious", and "intelligent", while also noting her weaknesses: "bossy", "aggressive", and "tactless".<ref name="abc char">{{cite web | url=http://abc.go.com/shows/greys-anatomy/bio/cristina-yang/94909 | title=Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) Bio | publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]] | work=[[Grey's Anatomy]] | accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> Oh said of her character: "I've always tried to play Cristina with a tremendous amount of focus and ambition <U+2014> which is the reality for a female surgeon. I mean, in real life there aren't many of them. But the ones you encounter are at the very top of their game. You have to have a kind of ascetic personality to survive."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/sandra-oh |last=Newman |first=Judith |title=Marie Claire Sandra Oh Interview |work=Marie Claire |publisher=Hearst Corporation |date=March 7, 2007 |accessdate= September 3, 2012}}</ref> Rhimes referred to Yang's relationship with Burke by the [[portmanteau]] "Burktina", citing "[[Losing My Religion (Grey's Anatomy)|Losing My Religion]]" as one of her favorite episodes featuring them because it shows their evolution from the beginning of the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 2)|second season]] to its end.<ref name="grey matter">{{cite web|last=Rhimes|first=Shonda|title=From Shonda Rhimes (FINALLY)...|url=http://www.greyswriters.com/2006/05/from_shonda_rhi.html|work=Grey Matter|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]]|accessdate=July 14, 2012|date=May 17, 2006}}</ref> 
[[File:Kevin McKidd1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Kevin McKidd]]'s character was introduced as a love interest for Yang.]]
Rhimes commented, "[We see] her struggle to suppress all of her humanity in pursuit of perfection. And in my mind, what we realize is that she is not cold. She is terrified. Scared that if she lets her emotions out, they will overtake her and she will be hurt. And you can<U+2019>t hate her. Because it's so incredibly human and understandable."<ref name="grey matter"/> Yang's friendship with Meredith has been looked upon as "sisterhood", and Yang has repeatedly referred to the former as "her person". This led to the two being dubbed "the twisted sisters". At the conclusion of [[Grey's Anatomy (season 3)|season three]], the duo went on a "honeymoon" together, and Rhimes called it her favorite detail of the [[Didn't We Almost Have It All?|finale]].<ref name="ChangeC">{{cite web | url=http://www.greyswriters.com/2007/10/shonda-on-the-s.html| title=Shonda on the Season Premiere Episode "A Change Is Gonna Come"... | publisher=Grey Matter | work=ABC | date=October 3, 2007 | accessdate=June 19, 2012 | author=Rhimes, Shonda}}</ref> 

''[[New York (magazine)|New York magazine]]'' wrote of the character: "There's probably no woman on TV right now more single-mindedly dedicated to her career than Cristina. It has long been her defining characteristic. If it occasionally makes her into a caricature, it has also unquestionably established that she would have an abortion in this circumstance."<ref name="NYmag1">{{cite web|last=Paskin|first=Willa|title=A Character on Grey<U+2019>s Anatomy Actually Had an Abortion on Prime-Time Television Last Night|url=http://www.vulture.com/2011/09/someone_actually_had_an_aborti.html|work=[[New York (magazine)]]|accessdate=September 10, 2012|date=September 23, 2011}}</ref> Talking about Yang's abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes explained she intended Yang to have an abortion already in the second season but changed it with an ectopic pregnancy at the suggestion of one of her writers because  "that was so much more interesting, story-wise". As for the abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes commented: "I really wanted Cristina Yang to stay true to who Cristina Yang is. And I feel like that is a character who has never really wanted to be a mother. The idea that this woman would have a child that she did not want and resented for ruining her career and resented Owen for making her have [it] would have been hideous. [The abortion] made sense for the character."<ref>{{cite web|last=Paskin|first=Willa Paskin|title=Shonda Rhimes on Grey<U+2019>s Anatomy<U+2019>s Recent Abortion Story Line|url=http://www.vulture.com/2011/09/shonda_rhimes_talks_about_grey.html|work=New York magazine|accessdate=September 10, 2012|date=September 27, 2011}}</ref>  

Discussing his onscreen relationship with Yang, McKidd said: "It's not going to be easy for them. What I read when I read the season premiere, and this is just my take on it, is that it was very much two very analytical people, Owen and Cristina. They're very similar in a way, I think, as people.

We would shoot all our scenes for a day or two straight, and that was extremely challenging because emotionally and physically it becomes really exhausting."<ref name="The Hollywood Reporter">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/emmys-2012-greys-anatomy-sandra-oh-339356 |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |title='Grey's Anatomy's' Sandra Oh on Cristina's Emotional Season |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=June 25, 2012 |accessdate=September 3, 2012}}</ref> 

Oh said of Yang's expressions of emotions during season eight: "You see her express her emotions with only two people: her best friend Meredith and her husband Owen. To see someone being pulled apart so intensely, which honestly most everyone goes through in their life in some ways, if you're lucky you're completely pulled apart and then you have to pull yourself together, which hopefully will be the exploration within hopefully the next season."<ref name="The Hollywood Reporter" /> Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'': "I think they're meant for each other.
