'''Michael Edward Palin''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born [[May 5]], [[1943]]) is an [[England|English]] [[comedian]], [[actor]] and [[television presenter]] best known for being one of the members of the comedy group [[Monty Python]] and for his travel [[documentary film|documentaries]].

In a 2005 poll to find ''The Comedian's Comedian'', he was voted the 30th favourite by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/the-comedian-s-comedian ''The Comedian's Comedian]'', URL accessed 13th December 2006</ref>

== Early life and career ==

Palin was born in [[Broomhill, Sheffield, South Yorkshire|Broomhill]], Sheffield. His father was an engineer working for a steel firm. He started his education at [[Birkdale School|Birkdale]] [[preparatory school]], Sheffield, and later [[Shrewsbury School]], [[Shrewsbury]]. When he was five years old at Birkdale, Palin had his first acting experience playing Martha Cratchit in a school performance of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''. At the age of ten Palin, still interested in acting, made a comedy monologue and read a Shakespeare play to his mother while playing all the parts.<ref> Ross, 200 </ref> After his school days in 1962 he went on to read [[Modern history]] at [[Brasenose College, Oxford]]. With fellow student [[Robert Hewison]] he performed and wrote, for the first time, comedy material at a university Christmas party.<ref> [http://www.acornmedia.com/rippingyarns/MEP_Bio.htm Michael Palin biography]</ref> [[Terry Jones]], also a student in Oxford, saw that performance and began writing together with Hewison and Palin.<ref> Ross, 200 </ref> In the same year Palin joined the Brightside and Carbrook Co-Operative Society Players and first gained fame when he won an acting award at a Co-Op drama festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/documentaries/stories/s712623.htm |title=ABC TV Documentaries: Sahara episode 3/4 |accessdate=2006-09-02 |work=Australian Broadcasting Company}}</ref> He also performed in [[the Oxford Revue]] together with Jones.

In 1966 he married his wife Helen Gibbins, whom he met for the first time in 1959 when on holiday in [[Stowmarket]]. This meeting was later fictionalised in the play ''East of Ipswich'' written by Palin.<ref>Ross, 57 </ref> Together they have three children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warman.demon.co.uk/anna/mp_int.html | title=Travelling with Michael Palin | first=Anna | last=Warman | accessdate=2006-08-14}}</ref> When his son William still was a baby he briefly appeared in ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' as Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.

After finishing university in 1965 Palin became a presenter on a comedy pop show called ''Now!'' for the television contractor [[Television Wales and the West]].<ref>[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/510300/index.html ''Michael Palin''] by John Oliver at BFI Screen Online, URL accessed 13th December, 2006</ref> At the same time, Palin was contacted by Terry Jones, who had left university a year earlier, to reunite the pair as a writing duo. Together with Jones, Palin wrote comedy for various [[BBC]] programmes, like ''The Kenn Dodd Show'', ''The Billy Cotton Bandshow'' and ''The Illustrated Weekly Hudd''.<ref>[http://orangecow.org/pythonet/michael-palin.html Biography] at Pythonet.org, URL accessed 17th December, 2006</ref> They were also in the team of writers working for ''[[The Frost Report]]''. Other members of this team were [[Frank Muir]], [[Barry Cryer]], [[Marty Feldman]], [[Ronnie Barker]], [[Ronnie Corbett]], [[Dick Vosburgh]] and future Monty Python members [[Graham Chapman]], [[John Cleese]] and [[Eric Idle]]. Although the members of Monty Python had already encountered each other over the years, ''The Frost Report'' was the first time all the English members of Monty Python ([[Terry Gilliam]] is an American) worked together. During the run of ''The Frost Report'' the Palin/Jones team contributed material to two shows starring [[John Bird]]: ''The Late Show'' and ''A series of Bird's''. For ''A series of Bird's'' the Palin/Jones team had their first experience of writing narrative instead of the short sketches they used to write.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/s/seriesofbirdsa_1299002783.shtml | title=A Series Of Bird's | work=bbc.co.uk Guide to Comedy | accesdate=2006-09-16}}</ref>

Following ''The Frost Report'' the Palin/Jones team worked as actors and writers on the show ''[[Twice a fortnight]]'' with [[Graeme Garden]], [[Bill Oddie]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]], and the successful children's comedy show ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'' with [[Eric Idle]] and [[David Jason]]. The animations on ''Do Not Adjust Your Set'' were made by [[Terry Gilliam]] who joined the cast on recommendation by Cleese and was the first time the Palin/Jones team worked with him. Without Jones, Palin was asked by Cleese, who was eager to work again with Palin,<ref>Ross, 91 </ref> to perform in ''[[How to Irritate People]]'' together with Chapman and [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]]. A television program meant to break into the American market. The Palin/Jones team worked again together in ''[[The Complete and Utter History of Britain]]''.

It was during this time that John Cleese called up Michael Palin and wondered whether he was interested in doing a show with him, which would become ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''. Cleese and Chapman were offered a show by the BBC who had seen them on ''The Frost Report'', among other programmes. However, Cleese was reluctant to do a [[Double act|two-man show]], for various reasons &mdash; including Chapman's supposedly difficult personality. At the same time, following the success of ''Do Not Adjust Your Set'' Palin, Jones, Idle and Gilliam, were offered their own series together. While this series was still in production Palin agreed to Cleese's proposal and brought Idle, Jones and Gilliam along. Much has been made of the fact that the Monty Python troupe is the result of Cleese's desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold.<ref>''The Pythons Autobiography By The Pythons''; [[Graham Chapman]], [[John Cleese]], [[Terry Gilliam]], [[Eric Idle]], [[Terry Jones]], Michael Palin, [[John Chapman]], [[David Sherlock]], [[Bob McCabe]]; Thomas Dunne Books; 2003</ref>

== ''Monty Python'' ==
{{main|Monty Python}}
[[Image:Lumberjack Song.jpg|thumb|300px|Palin performs The Lumberjack Song, with [[Connie Booth]] as his "best Girl."]]

In ''Monty Python'', Palin played various roles, showing the range of his acting abilities. Roles go from manic enthusiasm, (such as the [[lumberjack]] of [[the Lumberjack Song]]), or unflappable calmness (such as the [[Dead Parrot]] vendor or [[Cheese Shop sketch|Cheese Shop]] proprietor).  As the latter, he was often a foil to the rising ire of characters portrayed by John Cleese.  

Palin frequently wrote with Terry Jones for the sketches, some of the most memorable being the Lumberjack Song and Spam. But some sketches Palin wrote by himself, (or began the sketch by himself) such as the [[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|Spanish Inquisition sketch]], in which a fairly widespread [[catchphrase]] was created- "''No''body expects the [[Spanish Inquisition]]!"

Each member of Monty Python has an [[asteroid]] named after him. Palin's is Asteroid [[9621 Michaelpalin]].<ref> {{cite web|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=9621 |title=JPL Small-Body Database Browser |accessdate=2006-10-17 |work=Jet Propulsion Laboratory }}</ref>

== Other performances ==
[[Image:Ripping Yarns - Eric Olthwaite Being Tested.jpg|thumb|left|Palin in the ''[[Ripping Yarns]]'' episode: ''The Testing of Eric Olthwaite'']]

After the Monty Python television series ended, Palin collaborated with Python writing partner Terry Jones on the television comedy series ''[[Ripping Yarns]]'' and the play ''[[Secrets (play)|Secrets]]'', from the BBC series ''[[Black and Blue (TV series)|Black and Blue]]''.  He also appeared in ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'' as Eric Manchester (based on [[Derek Taylor]]) press agent for [[The Rutles]].

In 1982, Palin wrote and starred in ''[[The Missionary]]'', co-starring [[Maggie Smith]]. In it, he plays the Reverend Charles Fortesque who is recalled back from Africa to England to aid prostitutes. 

He appeared in [[Terry Gilliam|Terry Gilliam's]] films ''[[Time Bandits]]'', ''[[Jabberwocky (film)|Jabberwocky]]'', and ''[[Brazil (film)|Brazil]]''. His biggest international role in a movie besides Python was as stuttering would-be assassin Ken Pile in ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]''. The film was such a success that John Cleese reunited the main cast almost a decade later to make ''[[Fierce Creatures]]''. [[Image:Brazil 04.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Palin plays a torturer in ''[[Brazil (film)|Brazil'' (1985)]]]]After filming for ''Fierce Creatures'' finished, Palin went on a travel journey for a BBC documentary and, returning a year later, found that the end of ''Fierce Creatures'' had failed at test screenings and had to be reshot. 

Apart from ''Fierce Creatures'', Palin's last film role was a small part (The Sun) in ''[[The Wind in the Willows (1996 film)|The Wind in the Willows]]'', or Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, a film directed by and starring Terry Jones. Palin also appeared with John Cleese in his documentary, ''The Human Face''.

He also assisted [[Transport 2000]] and others with campaigns on transport policy issues, particularly those relating to urban areas, and has now become president of Transport 2000.<ref>[http://www.transport2000.org.uk/celebrity/maintainNewsArticles.asp?CelebrityArticleID=11 '' Michael Palin on transport fit for all our futures''], article by Palin at Transport 2000.org, URL accessed 13th December, 2006</ref>

Palin has also appeared as a "straight" actor in serious drama. In 1991 Palin worked as producer and actor in the film ''[[American Friends]]'' based upon a real event in the life of his great grandfather, a fellow at St John's College, Oxford.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/american_friends/about.php ''American Friends''] at [[Rotten Tomatoes]].com, URL accessed 13th December 2006</ref> In that same year he also played the part of a headmaster in [[Alan Bleasdale]]'s [[Channel 4]] drama series ''[[G.B.H. (TV drama)|G.B.H.]]''.

In 2000 Palin became a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services to [[television]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/584037.stm | work = Trio of Dames lead showbiz honours | title=BBC News|date = [[31 December]] [[1999]] | accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref>

== Travel documentaries ==
Palin's first travel documentary was part of the 1980 [[BBC Television]] series ''[[Great Railway Journeys of the World]]'', in which &mdash; humorously reminiscing about his childhood hobby of [[train spotting]] &mdash; he travelled throughout the UK by train, from [[London]] to [[Kyle of Lochalsh]], via [[Manchester]], [[York]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Inverness]]. At the Kyle of Lochalsh, Palin bought the station's long metal platform sign and is seen lugging it back to London with him.
In 1994, a second journey of Palin's for the same series, entitled "Derry to Kerry", went through [[Ireland]]. 

Since 1989, Palin has written and appeared in a series of comprehensive travel programmes for British television, which have been broadcast around the world: 

* ''[[Michael Palin: Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1989): travelling as closely as possible the path described in the famous [[Jules Verne]] story without using [[aircraft]].
* ''[[Pole to Pole]]'' (1992): travelling from the [[North Pole]] to the [[South Pole]], following as closely as possible the 30 degree line of [[longitude]], over as much land as possible, i.e., through [[Europe]] and [[Africa]].
*''[[Irish Railway Journey: Derry to Kerry]]'' (1994): a quest for family roots, an attempt to trace his great grandmother &mdash; Brita Gallagher &mdash; who set sail from Ireland 150 years ago during the potato famine, bound for a new life in [[Burlington, New Jersey]], [[USA]]. It is a trip along the Palin family line.
* ''[[Full Circle with Michael Palin]]'' (1997): in which he circumnavigated the lands around the [[Pacific|Pacific Ocean]] counter-clockwise; a journey of 80,000 kilometres starting on [[Little Diomede]] Island in the [[Bering Strait]] and taking him through [[Asia]], [[Oceania]] and the [[Americas]].
* ''[[Michael Palin's Hemingway Adventure]]'' (1999): retracing the footsteps of [[Ernest Hemingway]] through the [[United States]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]], and the [[Caribbean]].
* ''[[Sahara with Michael Palin]]'' (2002): in which he trekked through the world's [[Sahara|largest desert]].
*''[[Himalaya with Michael Palin]]'' (2004): in which he travels through the [[Himalaya|Himalaya region]].

In 2005, he presented ''Michael Palin and the Mystery of Hammershoi'', about the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[artist]] [[Vilhelm Hammersh<U+00F8>i]], whose work he collects.

In May 2006, he embarked on a new project, currently called ''Palin's New Europe'', which includes visits to twenty-one countries once in the [[Soviet bloc]] and [[Yugoslavia]] and that are now either part of or future members of the European Union, as well as countries like Turkey which are applying to join the EU. The New Europe travels are intended to produce six one-hour programmes for BBC 1 and a book, both planned for release in late 2007.

Palin's travel programmes are responsible for a phenomenon termed the "Palin effect": areas of the world that he has visited suddenly become popular tourist attractions &mdash; for example, the significant increase in the number of holidaymakers interested in journeying to [[Peru]] after Palin visited [[Machu Picchu]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Ben | last=Webster | coauthors= | title=Globetrotter Palin brought down to earth by eco-lobby|date=[[2005-01-14]] | publisher= | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1984591,00.html | work =The Times | pages = | accessdate = 2006-08-14 | language = }}</ref>

In honour of his achievements as a traveller (especially rail travel), Palin has a British train named after him. Virgin Trains' [[Super voyager|Super Voyager]] number 221130 carries his name externally and a plaque is located adjacent to the onboard shop with information on Palin and his many journeys.<ref>[http://www.virgintrainsmediaroom.com/index.cfm?articleid=179 Virgin Trains], URL accessed 13th December, 2006</ref>
