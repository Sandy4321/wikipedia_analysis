'''Waylon Arnold Jennings''' ({{IPA-en|wel<U+0259>n d<U+0292><U+025B>n<U+026A><U+014B>z|pron}}; June 15, 1937 <U+2013> February 13, 2002) was an American [[country music]] singer, songwriter, and musician. Jennings began playing guitar at eight and began performing at twelve on [[KVOW]] radio. He formed a band, ''The Texas Longhorns''. Jennings worked as a D.J. on KVOW, [[KDAV]], [[KYTI]] and [[KBZO (AM)|KLLL]]. In 1958, [[Buddy Holly]] arranged Jennings' first recording session, of "Jolie Blon" and "When Sin Stops (Love Begins)". Holly hired him to play bass. During the ''Winter Dance Party Tour'', in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], Holly chartered a plane to arrive to the next venue. Jennings gave up his seat in the plane to [[The Big Bopper|J. P. Richardson]], who was suffering from a cold. The flight that carried Holly, Richardson and [[Ritchie Valens]] crashed, on the day later known as [[The Day the Music Died]]. Following the accident, Jennings worked as a D.J. in [[Coolidge, Arizona]] and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. He formed a [[rockabilly]] club band, ''The Waylors''. He recorded for independent label Trend Records, [[A&M Records]] before succeeding with [[RCA Victor]] after achieving creative control of his records.

During the 1970s, Jennings joined the [[Outlaw Country|Outlaw movement]]. He released critically acclaimed albums ''[[Lonesome, On'ry and Mean]]'' and ''[[Honky Tonk Heroes]]'', followed by hit albums ''[[Dreaming My Dreams (Waylon Jennings album)|Dreaming My Dreams]]'' and ''[[Are You Ready for the Country]]''. In 1976 he released the album ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]'' with [[Willie Nelson]], [[Tompall Glaser]] and [[Jessie Colter]], the first platinum country music album. The success of the album was followed by ''[[Ol' Waylon]]'', and the hit song "[[Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)]]". By the early 1980s, Jennings was struggling with a [[cocaine]] addiction, which he quit in 1984. Later he joined the country [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]] with Nelson, [[Kris Kristofferson]] and [[Johnny Cash]]. During that period, Jennings released the successful album, ''[[Will the Wolf Survive]]''. He toured less after 1997, to spend more time with his family. Between 1999 and 2001, his appearances were limited by health problems. On February 13, 2002, Jennings died from complications of [[diabetes]].

Jennings also appeared in movies and television series. He was the narrator for ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]''. In 2001 he was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]], which he chose not to attend until later on. In 2007 he was posthumously awarded the Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award by the [[Academy of Country Music]].

==Early life==
Waylon Jennings was born in [[Littlefield, Texas]], the seat of [[Lamb County, Texas|Lamb County]], the son of Lorene Beatrice (n<U+00E9>e Shipley) and William Albert Jennings.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=4}} His original birth name was Wayland, meaning land by the highway, but it was changed after a Baptist preacher visited Jennings' parents and congratulated his mother for naming him after the [[Wayland Baptist University]] in [[Plainview, Texas]]. Lorene Jennings, who had been unaware of the college, changed the spelling to Waylon. Jennings later expressed in his autobiography "I didn't like Waylon. It sounded corny and hillbilly, but it's been good to me, and I'm pretty well at peace with it right now."{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=6}} When Jennings was eight, his mother taught him to play guitar with the tune "Thirty Pieces of Silver". Jennings used to practice with the guitars of his relatives, until his mother bought him a used [[Stella (guitar)|Stella]], and later ordered a [[Harmony Company models#Patrician|Harmony Patrician]].{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=22}} Jennings never learned to read music, but he practiced to seek a career in music and avoid a possible future picking cotton and other temporary jobs.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=8}}{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=33}}

==Music career==
===Beginnings in music===
The twelve-year-old Jennings auditioned for a spot on KVOW in Littlefield, Texas. Owner J.B. McShan, along with Emil Macha, recorded Jennings' performance. McShan liked his style, and hired him for a weekly thirty-minute program. Following this successful introduction, Jennings formed his own band. He asked Macha to play bass for him, and gathered other friends and acquaintances to form ''The Texas Longhorns''. The style of the band, a mixture of [[country & western]] and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], was often not well received. At seventeen, Jennings and band recorded a demo of the songs "Stranger in My Home" and "There'll Be a New Day" at [[KFYO (AM)|KFYO]] radio in [[Lubbock, Texas]].{{sfn|Carr|Munde|1997|p=154}} In addition to performing on air for KVOW, Jennings later worked as a D.J. for the station.{{sfn|Carr|Munde|1997|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=6Q2QhJf4jR0C&lpg=PT166&dq=Waylon%20Jennings%20KLLL&pg=PT166#v=onepage&q=Waylon%20Jennings%20KLLL&f=false 155]}} Jennings dropped out of high school in tenth grade to pursue music.

While working in KDAV, Jennings met [[Buddy Holly]], during the broadcasts of ''Sunday Party''. Holly, who wanted to start in record production, arranged a session for Jennings. On September 10, Jennings recorded the songs "Jolie Blon" and "When Sin Stops (Love Begins)", with Holly and [[Tommy Allsup]] on guitars with saxophonist [[King Curtis]]. The single was released on Brunswick in 1959 with limited success. Holly then hired Jennings to play electric bass for him during his "Winter Dance Party Tour".{{sfn|Carr|Munde|1997|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=6Q2QhJf4jR0C&lpg=PT166&dq=Waylon%20Jennings%20KLLL&pg=PT166#v=onepage&q=Waylon%20Jennings%20KLLL&f=false 155]}}

After a show in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], Holly chartered a plane for himself, Allsup and Jennings to avoid a long bus trip to  [[Fargo, North Dakota]]. Allsup lost a coin toss to [[Ritchie Valens]] for his seat on the plane, while Jennings gave up his seat to [[The Big Bopper|J. P. Richardson]], who was suffering from a cold and complaining about how uncomfortable a long bus trip was for a man of his size.<ref>Texas Monthly, January 1988; [http://books.google.com/books?id=AyoEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA103&dq=Big%20Bopper%20%20waylon%20coin%20flip&pg=PA103#v=onepage&q&f=false p.108]</ref> Holly jokingly told Jennings, "I hope your ol' bus freezes up!".

===Phoenix and the Nashville Sound===
[[File:Waylon Jennings Promotional Picture cropped.JPG|Waylon Jennings publicitary portrait for RCA Victor circa 1965|upright|thumb]]
In 1961, Jennings lived briefly in [[Coolidge, Arizona]] working in radio, before moving to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], where he formed a rockabilly band, ''The Waylors''. Jennings and his band performed at a newly opened nightspot called ''JD's''. The band earned a small fan base, eventually signing with the independent label Trend Records. The recordings were not successful and Jennings began working as a record producer. In 1963, he moved to [[Los Angeles, California]] where he signed a contract with [[Herb Alpert]] of [[A&M Records]].{{sfn|Carr|Munde|1997|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=6Q2QhJf4jR0C&lpg=PT166&dq=Waylon%20Jennings%20KLLL&pg=PT167#v=onepage&q&f=false 156]}}<ref name="AM">{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/waylon-jennings-p1663/biography|title=Waylon Jennings - Biography|work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas}}</ref>

His records had little success, because A&M's main releases were [[folk music]] rather than country.{{sfn|Wolff|Duane|2000|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=3Jorozp1yp4C&lpg=PA360&dq=Four%20Strong%20Winds%20%20Just%20To%20Satisfy%20You%20phoenix&pg=PA360#v=onepage&q&f=false 360]}} He had a few hits on local radio in Phoenix, including [[Ian Tyson]]'s "[[Four Strong Winds]]" and "Just To Satisfy You" (co-written with Don Bowman). He also recorded an album on BAT called ''[[Waylon at JD's|JD's]]''. After 500 copies were sold at the club, another 500 copies were pressed by the Sounds label.<ref>Country Music Foundation; p.53</ref> He also played lead guitar for [[Patsy Montana]] on a 1964 album.<ref>Bluegrass Unlimited; p.44</ref> Alpert tried to shift Jennings' style from country to pop, but Jennings refused. After his only single, "Sing the Girl a Song, Bill", Alpert released Jennings.<ref name="AM"/> 

Singer [[Bobby Bare]], who covered Jennings' songs "Four Strong Winds" and "Just To Satisfy You", recommended Jennings to producer [[Chet Atkins]], who signed Jennings to [[RCA Victor]] in 1965.{{sfn|Wolff|Duane|2000|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=3Jorozp1yp4C&lpg=PA360&dq=Four%20Strong%20Winds%20%20Just%20To%20Satisfy%20You%20phoenix&pg=PA360#v=onepage&q&f=false 360]}} 
{{Listen|filename=Just to Satisfy You Waylon Jennings.ogg|title="Just to Satify You"|description= From the album of the [[Just to Satisfy You|same name]], the song was a local radio hit for Jennings in Nashville}} In 1966, Jennings released his debut album for RCA ''[[Folk-Country]]'', followed by ''[[Leavin' Town]]'', and ''[[Nashville Rebel]]''.{{sfn|Cramer, Alfred|p=715|2009}}{{sfn|Thompson, Clifford|p=622|2002}} Nashville rebel was the [[soundtrack]] to an independent film of the [[Nashville Rebel (film)|same name]], starring Jennings.<ref name="rebel"/> In 1967, Jennings released a hit single, "[[Just to Satisfy You (song)|Just to Satisfy You]]". During an interview, Jennings remarked that the song was a "pretty good example" of the influence of his work with Buddy Holly and rockabilly music.{{sfn|Country song roundup staff|1967}} During the next years, Jennings produced mid-chart albums that sold well, including ''[[Just to Satisfy You]]'', that included the same-named hit single of 1967.{{sfn|Cramer, Alfred|p=715|2009}}

In 1972, Jennings released ''[[Ladies Love Outlaws (Waylon Jennings album)|Ladies Love Outlaws]]''. The single that headlined the album became a hit for Jennings, and was his first approach to [[Outlaw Country]].{{sfn|Larkin|1995|p=3005}} Jennings was accustomed to performing and recording with his own band, The Waylors; a practice that was not encouraged by powerful Nashville producers. Over time, however, Jennings felt limited by the [[Nashville sound]]'s lack of artistic freedom.{{sfn|Petrusich|2008|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=5w9nVLtRSgwC&lpg=PA105&dq=waylon%20jennings%20Nashville%20sound&pg=PA105#v=onepage&q&f=false 105]}} The music style publicized as "[[Countrypolitan]]" was characterized by orchestral arrangements, and the absence of traditional country music instruments. The producers did not let Jennings play his own guitar, or select material to record.{{sfn|Carr|Munde|1997|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=6Q2QhJf4jR0C&lpg=PT166&dq=Waylon%20Jennings%20KLLL&pg=PT167#v=onepage&q&f=false 156]}}

===Outlaw Country===
In an interview Jennings recalled the restrictions of the Nashville establishment, "They wouldn't let you do anything. You had to dress a certain way: you had to do everything a certain way [...] They kept trying to destroy me.... I just went about my business and did things my way [...] You start messing with my music, I get mean"{{sfn|Ashby, LeRoy|p= [http://books.google.com/books?id=qY0MDlK4_gsC&lpg=PA418&dq=waylon%20jennings%20atlantic%20records&pg=PA418#v=onepage&q&f=false p.418]|2006}} In 1972, his recording contract was nearing an end. [[Hepatitis]]-afflicted Jennings accepted an offer from Neil Reshen to renegotiate his recording and touring contracts. At a meeting in a Nashville airport, Jennings introduced Reshen to [[Willie Nelson]]. By the end of the meeting, Reshen had become manager to both singers. Jennings' new deal gained him a $75,000 advance and artistic control.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|pp=187-192}}{{sfn|Petrusich|2008|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=5w9nVLtRSgwC&lpg=PA105&dq=waylon%20jennings%20Nashville%20sound&pg=PA106#v=onepage&q&f=false 106]}} Reshen advised Jennings to keep the beard that he had grown in the hospital, in order to match the image of outlaw country.{{sfn|Larkin|1995|p=2159}}{{sfn|Lewis|1993|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=8_afNI8SL6UC&lpg=PA169&dq=Neil%20reshen%22%20willie%20nelson%20waylon&pg=PA169#v=onepage&q&f=false 169]}}{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=266}}

He followed with ''[[Lonesome, On'ry and Mean]]'' and ''[[Honky Tonk Heroes]]'' in 1973, the first albums recorded and released under his creative control.

In 1985 Jennings joined with [[USA for Africa]] to record "[[We Are the World]]", but he left the studio due to a dispute over the song's lyrics that were sung in [[Swahili language|Swahili]].{{sfn|Breskin|2004|p=6}}<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,309280,00.html|title=They Were the World|last=Cagle|first=Jess|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=July 11, 2009|date=January 24, 1992}}</ref> By this time, his sales decreased.

Despite low record sales, Jennings attracted large audiences in live appearances.<ref name="AM"/> In 1997, after the ''[[Lollapalooza]] tour'', he decreased his tour schedule and became centered on his family.{{sfn|Birk, Carl|2005|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=db7uwE2_lJ8C&lpg=PA72&dq=Cowboys%2C%20Sisters%2C%20Rascals%20and%20Dirt%20waylon%20jennings&pg=PA71#v=onepage&q=Cowboys,%20Sisters,%20Rascals%20and%20Dirt%20waylon%20jennings&f=false p.71]}}

In 1998, Jennings teamed up with Bare, [[Jerry Reed]] and [[Mel Tillis]] to form The [[Old Dogs]]. The group recorded a double album of songs penned entirely by [[Shel Silverstein]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p352588|title=Old Dogs|work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=October 25, 2011|author=Ankeny, Jason}}</ref>
In mid 1999, Jennings assembled what he referred to as his "hand-picked dream team" &ndash; and formed Waylon & The Waymore Blues Band. Consisting primarily of former Waylors, the thirteen-member group performed a limited number of concerts from 1999 to 2001.{{sfn|George-Warren|Romanowski|Pareles|2001|p=492}} In January 2000, Jennings recorded what would become his final album at Nashville's historic [[Ryman Auditorium]], ''[[Never Say Die: Live]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452290/country-legend-waylon-jennings-dies-at-64.jhtml|title=Country Music Outlaw Waylon Jennings Dies At 64|date=February 13, 2002|author=D'Angelo, Joe|work=MTV News|publisher=MTV Networks|accessdate=October 25, 2011}}</ref>

==Music style and image==
Jennings was characterized by his "powerful" singing voice, noted by his "rough-edged quality", as well as his phrasing and texture.{{sfn|Brown|p=132|1986}}{{sfn|Ward|2012|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=9Y1EZ_cMs6kC&lpg=PA308&dq=Waylon%20jennings%20voice&pg=PA308#v=onepage&q&f=false 308]}}
Accompanying his vocals, he played guitar. He was recognized for his "spanky-twang" playing. To create his sound, he used a mixture of thumb and fingers during the rhythmic parts, while using picks for the lead runs. He combined [[hammer-on]] and [[pull-off]] riffs, with eventual upper-fret [[double stop]]s and [[Modulation (music)|modulation effects]].{{sfn|Hunter|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=uneqkeXAzoIC&lpg=PA124&dq=Waylon%20jennings%20guitar&pg=PA124#v=onepage&q&f=false 124]}} Jennings played a 1953 [[Fender Telecaster]], which was purchased used by ''The Waylors''. Jennings' bandmates adorned his guitar with a distinctive leather cover, that featured a black background with a white floral work.{{sfn|Hunter|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=uneqkeXAzoIC&lpg=PA124&dq=Waylon%20jennings%20guitar&pg=PA125#v=onepage&q&f=false 125]}}{{sfn|Jennings & Kaye|1996|p=105}} Jennings did further customizing work on the guitar, by filing down the frets to lower the strings on the neck to obtain the slapping sound.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Country Guitar|date=February 1995|title=Waylon Jennings guitar|p=15|publisher=Country Guitar Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Guitar player|volume=7|publisher=Miller Freeman Publications|year=1973|p=118|title=Interview: Waylon Jennings}}</ref> His signature image was characterized by his long hair and beard, as well as his black hat and the black leather vest he wore during his appareances.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2002-02-14/entertainment/obit.waylon.jennings_1_country-music-first-country-album-winter-dance-party?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ|title=Country great Waylon Jennings dies at 64|date=February 14, 2002|work=CNN|publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc|accessdate=May 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/04/willie-nelson-live-at-the-us-festival-1983/|title=Willie Nelson: Live!

==Personal life==
Jennings was married four times, and had six children. He was first married to Maxine Caroll Lawrence in 1956 at age 18, with whom he had four children Terry Vance Jennings (born January 21, 1957), Julie Rae Jennings (born August 12, 1958), Buddy Dean Jennings (born March 21, 1960), and Deana Jennings.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|pp=37-39}} Jennings married again on December 10, 1962 to Lynne Jones, adopting a child Tomi Lynne. They divorced in 1967.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=85, 100}} He next married Barbara Rood. He composed the song "This Time" about the trials and tribulations of his marriages and divorces.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=193}} He married for the fourth and final time in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], on October 26, 1969 to Jessi Colter.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=176}} Colter and Jennings had one son, [[Shooter Jennings|Waylon Albright "Shooter" Jennings]] (born May 19, 1979). Colter had one daughter, Jennifer, from her previous marriage.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=235}} Jennings' grandson, William "Struggle" Harness, became a rap/[[hip hop]] artist, based out of Nashville.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2011/11/04/today-in-celebrity-spawn-rap-projects|title=Today in Celebrity Spawn Rap Projects|date=November 4, 2011|author=Raymer, Miles|work=Chicago Reader|publisher=CL Chicago, Inc|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref>

In 1997, he stopped touring to be close to his family. To set an example about the importance of education to his son Waylon Albright, Jennings earned a [[GED]].{{sfn|Birk, Carl|2005|p= [http://books.google.com/books?id=db7uwE2_lJ8C&lpg=PA72&dq=Cowboys%2C%20Sisters%2C%20Rascals%20and%20Dirt%20waylon%20jennings&pg=PA72#v=onepage&q&f=false p.72]}}{{sfn|Kingsbury2004|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=untabCgOVkgC&lpg=PA264&dq=waylon%20jennings%20radio%20high%20school&pg=PA264#v=onepage&q&f=false 264]}}

===Addiction and recovery===
Jennings started to consume [[amphetamine]]s at the time he lived with Johnny Cash during the mid-1960s. Jennings later stated, "Pills were the artificial energy on which Nashville ran around the clock".<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> In 1977, Jennings was arrested by federal agents for conspiracy and 'possession of [[cocaine]] with intent to distribute'. A private courier warned the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] about the package sent to Jennings by a New York colleague that contained twenty-seven grams of cocaine. The DEA and the police went to Jennings' recording studio. They found no evidence, because while they were waiting for a [[search warrant]], Jennings flushed the cocaine. The charges were later dropped and Jennings was released.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=184}} The episode was recounted in Jennings' song "Don't You Think This Outlaw Bit's Done Got Outta Hand?"{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|pp=322-325}}

During the early 1980s, his [[cocaine addiction]] intensified. Jennings claimed to have spent US$1500 daily to satisfy his addiction, draining his personal finances and leaving him bankrupt with debt of up to US$2.5 million.{{sfn|Weatherby, Gregg|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=w-1-NqaOaKsC&lpg=PA46&dq=Waylon%20Jennings%20cocaine&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q&f=false p.46]|1988}}{{sfn|Ching, Barbara|2001|p=[http://books.google.com.ar/books?id=vGjeao0I3gwC&lpg=PA124&dq=%22%242.5%20million%22%20waylon&pg=PA124#v=onepage&q&f=false 124]}} Though he insisted on repaying the debt and did additional tours to earn the funds, his work became less focused and his tours deteriorated.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|pp=322-325}} Jennings decided to quit his addictions, leased a home in the [[Phoenix, Arizona]] area and spent a month [[Detoxification|detoxing]] himself, intending to start using cocaine again in a more controlled fashion afterward. In 1984 he quit cocaine. By Jennings' own admission in interviews, his son, Shooter Jennings, was the main inspiration to quit permanently.{{sfn|Weatherby, Gregg|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=w-1-NqaOaKsC&lpg=PA46&dq=Waylon%20Jennings%20cocaine&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q&f=false p.46]|1988}}

===Illness and death===
Jennings' health had been bad for years prior to his death. Jennings quit cocaine, and his habit of smoking six packs of [[cigarette]]s daily. In 1988 he underwent [[heart bypass surgery]].{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p=322}} By 2000 his diabetes worsened, and the pain reduced his mobility, forcing Jennings to end most touring.{{sfn|Birk, Carl|2005|p= [http://books.google.com/books?id=db7uwE2_lJ8C&lpg=PA72&dq=Cowboys%2C%20Sisters%2C%20Rascals%20and%20Dirt%20waylon%20jennings&pg=PA72#v=onepage&q&f=false p.72]}} Later the same year he went under surgery to improve his leg circulation.<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> In December 2001 his left foot was amputated at a hospital in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. On February 13, 2002, Jennings died in his sleep of diabetic complications in [[Chandler, Arizona]]. Jennings was buried in the Mesa City Cemetery, in [[Mesa, Arizona]]. At the funeral ceremony, on February 15, Colter sang "Storms Never Last" for the attendees, who included Jennings' close friends and fellow musicians.{{sfn|Birk, Carl|2005|p= [http://books.google.com/books?id=db7uwE2_lJ8C&lpg=PA72&dq=Cowboys%2C%20Sisters%2C%20Rascals%20and%20Dirt%20waylon%20jennings&pg=PA72#v=onepage&q&f=false p.72]}}
