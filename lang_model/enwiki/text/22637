The '''Armero tragedy''' ({{lang-es|Tragedia de Armero}}) was one of the major consequences of the eruption of the [[Nevado del Ruiz]] [[stratovolcano]] in [[Tolima Department|Tolima]], [[Colombia]] on November 13, 1985. After 69 years of dormancy, the volcano's eruption caught nearby towns unaware, even though the government had received warnings to evacuate the area from multiple volcanological organizations when volcanic activity had been detected in September 1985.<ref>{{cite gvp|vnum = 1501-02=|name = Nevado del Ruiz|accessdate = June 1, 2010}}</ref> 

As [[pyroclastic flows]] erupted from the [[volcanic crater|volcano's crater]], they melted the mountain's glaciers, sending four enormous [[lahar]]s (volcanically induced [[mudslide]]s, [[landslide]]s, and [[debris flow]]s) down its slopes at {{convert|60|km/h|mph|-1|sp=us|abbr=none}}. The lahars picked up speed in [[gully|gullies]] and coursed into the six major rivers at the base of the volcano; they engulfed the [[Armero|town of Armero]], killing more than 20,000 of its almost 29,000&nbsp;inhabitants.<ref>Schuster, Robert L. and Highland, Lynn M. (2001). [http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2001/ofr-01-0276/ Socioeconomic and Environmental Impacts of Landslides in the Western Hemisphere], U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 01-0276.

Castaneda Martinez, Jorge E., and Olarte Montero, Juan, eds. Retrieved June 11, 2010.</ref> Casualties in other towns, particularly [[Chinchin<U+00E1>]], brought the overall death toll to 23,000. Footage and photographs of [[Omayra S<U+00E1>nchez]], a young victim of the [[Tragedy (event)|tragedy]], were published around the world. Other photographs of the lahars and the impact of the disaster captured attention worldwide and led to controversy over the degree to which the Colombian government was responsible for the disaster. A banner at a mass funeral in Ibague read, "The volcano didn't kill 22,000&nbsp;people. The government killed them."

The relief efforts were hindered by the composition of the mud, which made it nearly impossible to move through without becoming stuck. By the time relief workers reached Armero twelve hours after the eruption, many of the victims with serious injuries were dead. The relief workers were horrified by the landscape of fallen trees, disfigured human bodies, and piles of debris from entire houses. This was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century, surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of [[Mount Pel<U+00E9>e]], and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic event recorded since 1500 AD. The event was a foreseeable catastrophe exacerbated by unawareness of the volcano's destructive history; geologists and other experts had warned authorities and media outlets about the danger over the weeks and days leading up to the eruption. [[Hazard map]]s for the vicinity were prepared, but poorly distributed. On the day of the eruption, several evacuation attempts were made, but a severe storm restricted communications. Many victims stayed in their houses as they had been instructed, believing that the eruption had ended. The noise from the storm may have prevented many from hearing the sounds from Ruiz until it was too late.

Nevado del Ruiz has erupted several times since the disaster, and continues to threaten up to 500,000&nbsp;people living along the Combeima, Chinchina, Coello-Toche, and Guali river valleys. A lahar (or group of lahars) similar in size to the 1985 event could potentially travel as far as {{convert|100|km|mi|-1|sp=us}} from the volcano, and could be triggered by a small eruption. To counter this threat, the Colombian government established a specialized office which promotes awareness of natural threats. The [[United States Geological Survey]] also created the [[Volcano Disaster Assistance Program]] and the Volcano Crisis Assistance Team, which evacuated roughly 75,000&nbsp;people from the area around [[Mount Pinatubo]] before its 1991 eruption. In 1988, three years after the eruption, Dr. Stanley Williams of [[Louisiana State University]] stated that, "With the possible exception of [[Mount St. Helens]] in the state of Washington, no other volcano in the Western Hemisphere is being watched so elaborately" as Nevado del Ruiz. Additionally, many of Colombia's cities have programs to raise awareness of natural disaster planning programs which have helped save lives in natural disasters. Near Nevado del Ruiz in particular, locals have become wary of volcanic activity: when the volcano erupted in 1989, more than 2,300&nbsp;people living around it were evacuated.

Nevado del Ruiz has undergone three distinct eruptive periods, the first beginning 1.8&nbsp;million years ago. During the present period (beginning 11,000&nbsp;years ago), it has erupted at least twelve times, producing ashfalls, pyroclastic flows, and lahars. The historically recorded eruptions have primarily involved a central vent eruption (in the caldera) followed by an explosive eruption, then the formation of [[lahar]]s. Ruiz's earliest identified [[Holocene]] eruption was in about 6660&nbsp;BC, and further eruptions occurred around 1245, 850, 200&nbsp;BC and in about 350, 675, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps), 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps), 1845, 1916, December 1984 through March 1985, 1987 through July 1991, and possibly in April 1994. Many of these eruptions involved a central vent eruption, a flank vent eruption, and a [[phreatic explosion|phreatic (steam) explosion]].<ref name=GVPEH>{{cite gvp|vnum=1501-02=&volpage=erupt|title=Nevado del Ruiz: Eruptive History|accessdate=December 13, 2008}}</ref> Ruiz is the second-most active volcano in Colombia after [[Galeras]].<ref name=USGS1>{{Cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/Colombia/description_colombia_volcanoes.html |year=2001 |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |title=Colombia Volcanoes and Volcanics |accessdate=September 3, 2008}}</ref>

One week before the eruption, the [[Palace of Justice siege]] took place. The assailants ([[19th of April Movement|M-19]] guerrilla fighters) planned to hold a trial involving Colombian President [[Belisario Betancur]]. He refused to participate and sent the national army into the building. The attackers were holding several hundred hostages, including the 24 Supreme Court justices and 20 other judges. In the ensuing battle between the two forces, more than 75 hostages died (including 11 judges). This disaster, coupled with the Armero tragedy, spurred the Colombian government to predict and prepare for a broad range of threats.<ref name=ZA/>

==1985 activity==
===Precursor===
In late 1984, geologists noticed that seismic activity in the area had begun to increase. Increased [[fumarole]] activity, deposition of [[sulfur]] on the summit of the volcano, and phreatic eruptions also alerted geologists to the possibility of an eruption. Phreatic events, when rising magma encounters water, continued well into September 1985 (one major event took place on September 11, 1985), shooting steam high into the air. Activity began to decline in October, probably because the new [[magma]] had finished ascending into Nevado del Ruiz's volcanic edifice.<ref name=Naranjo1986/>

[[File:Nevado del Ruiz Volcano, Colombia.jpg|left|thumb|Nevado del Ruiz seen from space. The summit ice cap and glaciers surround the dark Arenas crater.]]
An Italian volcanological mission analyzed gas samples from fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor and found them to be a mixture of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, indicating a direct release of magma into the surface environment. Publishing a report for officials on October 22, 1985, the scientists determined that the risk of lahars was unusually high. To prepare for the eruption, the report gave several simple preparedness techniques to local authorities.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Barberi, F., Martini, M., and Rosi, M.| first1=F|date=July 1990|coauthors=M Martinia, M Rosi|title=Nevado del Ruiz volcano (Colombia): pre-eruption observations and the 13 November 1985 catastrophic event|journal=[[Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research]]|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|volume=42|issue=1<U+2013>2|pages=1<U+2013>12|doi=10.1016/0377-0273(90)90066-O|accessdate=August 31, 2010}}</ref> Another team gave the local officials [[seismograph]]s, but no instructions on how to operate them.<ref name=Less>{{cite web|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/2009/09_10_29.html|author=Hawaiian Volcano Observatory|title=Lessons Learned from the Armero, Colombia Tragedy |date=November 29, 2009|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=July 20, 2010}}</ref>

Volcanic activity increased again in November 1985 as magma neared the surface. Increasing quantities of gases rich in sulfur dioxide and elemental sulfur began to appear in the volcano. The water content of the fumaroles' gases decreased, and water springs in the vicinity of Nevado del Ruiz became enriched with magnesium, calcium and potassium, leached from the magma.<ref name=Naranjo1986/> The [[thermodynamic equilibrium|thermodynamic equilibration]] temperatures, corresponding to the chemical composition of the discharged gases, ranged from {{convert|200|to|600|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|-2}}; this is a measure of the temperature at which the gases equilibrated within the volcano. The extensive [[degassing]] of the magma caused pressure to build up inside the volcano in the space above the magma, which eventually resulted in the explosive eruption.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Giggenbach, W.F., Garcia P, N., Rodriguez V., L., Londo<U+00F1>o C, A., Rojas G., N., Calvache V., M.L.|year=1990 |first1=W |month=July |last2=Garciap |first2=N |last3=Londonoc |first3=A |last4=Rodriguezv |first4=L |last5=Rojasg |first5=N |last6=Calvachev |first6=M|title=The chemistry of fumarolic vapor and thermal-spring discharges from the Nevado del Ruiz volcanic-magmatic-hydrothermal system, Colombia  |journal=[[Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research]] |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |volume=42 |issue=1<U+2013>2|pages=13<U+2013>39 |doi=10.1016/0377-0273(90)90067-P|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}</ref>

===Preparation and attempted evacuation===
In September 1985, as earthquakes and phreatic eruptions rocked the area, local officials began planning for an evacuation. In October, a hazard map was finalized for the area around Nevado del Ruiz.{{#tag:ref|This was the first hazard map ever prepared for a [[List of volcanoes in Colombia|Colombian volcano]].<ref name=Vil5/>|group=nb}} This map highlighted the danger from falling material<U+2014>including ash and [[volcanic rock|rock]]<U+2014>near [[Murillo, Tolima|Murillo]], [[Santa Isabel, Tolima|Santa Isabel]], and [[Libano, Tolima|Libano]], as well as the threat of lahars in [[Mariquita]], [[Armero-Guayabal|Guayabal]], [[Chinchina, Tolima|Chinchina]] and [[Armero]].<ref name=MGueri>{{cite web|url=http://desastres.unanleon.edu.ni/pdf/2004/octubre/PDF/ENG/DOC4377/doc4377-contenido.pdf|title=Eruption of El Ruiz Volcano, Colombia|author=Gueri, Miguel|date=October 2004|publisher=[[UNAN-Le<U+00F3>n]]|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}</ref> Unfortunately, the map was poorly distributed to the people at high risk from Ruiz: many survivors had never heard of it, even though several of the country's major newspapers featured versions of the map.<ref name=Vil5>Villegas, p. 5.</ref> Henry Villegas of INGEOMINAS (Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology) stated that the hazard maps clearly demonstrated that Armero would be affected by the lahars, but that the map "met with strong opposition from economic interests." He added that because the map was not prepared long before the eruption, mass production and distribution of it in time was difficult.<ref name=Villegas6>Villegas, p. 6.</ref>
[[File:Nevado del Ruiz hazard map, from Wright and Pierson.png|thumb|left|350px|A recent hazard map prepared for Nevado del Ruiz and vicinity, showing all of the major disaster zones affected by the eruption]]
At least one of the hazard maps published in the prominent ''[[El Espectador]]'' newspaper in Bogot<U+00E1> included glaring errors. Without proper graphic scaling, it was unclear how big the map's hazard zones really were. The lahars on the map did not have a distinct ending point, and the main threat seemed to be from pyroclastic flows, not from mudflows. Though the map was colored blue, green, red, and yellow, there was no key to indicate what each color represented, and Armero was located in the green zone (believed to indicate the safest area). Another map published by the ''[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]'' newspaper featured illustrations which "gave a perception of topography to the public unfamiliar with maps, allowing them to relate hazard zones to the landscape." In spite of this presentation that was keyed to the audience, the map ended up a more artistic representation of the risk than a purely scientific one.<ref name=Villegas6/>

The day of the eruption, black ash columns erupted from the volcano at approximately 3:00&nbsp;pm local time. The local Civil Defense director was promptly alerted to the situation. He contacted INGEOMINAS, which ruled that the area should be evacuated; he was then told to contact the Civil Defense directors in Bogot<U+00E1> and Tolima. Between 5:00 and 7:00&nbsp;pm, the ash stopped falling, and local officials instructed people to "stay calm" and go inside. Around 5:00&nbsp;pm an emergency committee meeting was called, and when it ended at 7:00&nbsp;pm, several members contacted the regional Red Cross over the intended evacuation efforts at Armero, [[Mariquita]], and [[Honda, Colombia|Honda]]. The Ibague Red Cross contacted Armero's officials and ordered an evacuation, which was not carried out because of electrical problems caused by a storm. The storm's heavy rain and constant thunder may have overpowered the noise of the volcano, and with no systematic warning efforts, the residents of Armero were completely unaware of the continuing activity at Ruiz. At 9:45&nbsp;pm, after the volcano had erupted, Civil Defense officials from Ibague and Murillo tried to warn Armero's officials, but could not make contact. Later they overheard conversations between individual officials of Armero and others; famously, a few heard the Mayor of Armero speaking on a [[ham radio]], saying "that he did not think there was much danger," when he was overtaken by the lahar.<ref name=Mileti58>Mileti et. al, pp. 58<U+2013>64.</ref>

The eruption produced pyroclastic flows that melted summit glaciers and snow, generating four thick lahars that raced down river valleys on the volcano's flanks,<ref name="usgs"/> destroying a small lake that was observed in Arenas' crater several months before the eruption. Water in such volcanic lakes tends to be extremely salty, and may contain dissolved volcanic gases. The lake's hot, acidic water significantly accelerated the melting of the ice, an effect confirmed by the large amounts of [[sulfate]]s and [[chloride]]s found in the lahar flow.<ref name=Naranjo1986/>

Survivors in Armero described the night as "quiet". [[Volcanic ash]] had been falling throughout the day, but residents were informed it was nothing to worry about. Later in the afternoon, ash began falling again after a long period of quiet. Local radio stations reported that residents should remain calm and ignore the material. One survivor reported going to the fire department to be informed that the ash was "nothing".<ref name=KNE/>

During the night, the electrical power suddenly turned off and the radios went blank. Just before 11:30&nbsp;pm, a huge stream of water swept through Armero; it was powerful enough to flip cars and pick up people. A loud roar could be heard from the mountain, but the residents were panicked over what they believed to be a flood.<ref name=Marti290>Mart<U+00ED> and Ernst, p. 290.</ref>
[[Image:Armerodisaster.png|thumb|left|Armero, the aftermath]]
At 11:30&nbsp;pm, the first lahar hit, followed shortly by the others.<ref name=Marti290/> One of the lahars virtually erased Armero; three-quarters of its 28,700 inhabitants were killed.<ref name="usgs"/> Proceeding in three major waves, this lahar was {{convert|30|m|ft|-1|sp=us}} deep, moved at {{convert|12|m/s|ft/s|0|sp=us}}, and lasted ten to twenty minutes. Traveling at about {{convert|6|m|ft|0|sp=us}} per second, the second lahar lasted for thirty minutes and was followed by smaller pulses. A third major pulse brought the lahar's duration to roughly two hours; by that point, 85&nbsp;percent of Armero was enveloped in mud. Survivors described people holding on to debris from their homes in attempts to stay above the mud. Buildings collapsed, crushing people and raining down debris. The front of the lahar contained boulders and cobbles which would have crushed anyone in their path, while the slower parts were dotted by fine, sharp stones which caused lacerations. Mud moved into open wounds and other open body parts <U+2013> the eyes, ears, and mouth <U+2013> and placed pressure capable of inducing [[traumatic asphyxia]] in one or two minutes upon people buried in it. Mart<U+00ED> and Ernst state in their work ''Volcanoes and the Environment'' that they believe that many who survived the lahars succumbed to their injuries as they were trapped, or contracted hypothermia <U+2013> though the latter is unlikely, given that survivors described the water as warm.<ref name=Marti>Mart<U+00ED> and Ernst, p. 291.</ref>

A few bags filled with crops were discovered in the mud. Workers described an acrid smell of "rotting bodies,&nbsp;[...] wood smoke and decaying vegetables."<ref name=Miami/> To the horror of these workers, who were scrambling to begin relief efforts, survivors let out moans of pain and agony. The damages were assessed at seven billion dollars, an amount approximately one-fifth of Colombia's 1985 [[Gross National Product]].<ref name=SDSU>{{cite web|url=http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/Nevado.html|title=How Volcanoes Work <U+2013> the Nevado del Ruiz eruption|accessdate=July 20, 2010|author=Camp, Vic|publisher=[[San Diego State University]]|work=SDSU Department of Geological Sciences}}</ref>

As news of the catastrophe spread around the world, the ongoing [[Colombia presidental election, 1985|presidential election]] stopped, and the guerrilla fighters stopped their campaign "in view of the painful tragedy that has befallen our [the Colombian fighters] nation." Tickets for Colombian national championship soccer games added a surcharge of five&nbsp;cents to go to relief efforts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=E1shAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qoUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4917,8145495|title=Armero tragedy may hold seeds of future strife|work=[[Tri City Herald]]|date=November 24, 1985|accessdate=July 21, 2010}}</ref>

Scientists who later analyzed the seismograph data noticed that several [[Prediction of volcanic activity|long-period earthquake]]s (which begin strongly and then slowly die out) had occurred in the final hours before the eruption. Volcanologist Bernard Chouet said that, "the volcano was screaming 'I'm about to explode'", but the scientists who were studying the volcano at the time of the eruption were not able to read the signal.<ref>{{cite news|last=BBC contributors |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Signs of an eruption&nbsp;<U+2013> A scientist has found a way to use earthquakes to predict when volcanoes will erupt|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3183047.stm |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=August 27, 2003 |accessdate=September 13, 2008}}</ref>

==Relief efforts==
The eruption occurred at the same time as the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]], limiting the amount of supplies that could be sent to each of the disasters.<ref name=CSM/> Efforts were organized in [[Ibague, Tolima|Ibague]] and Bogot<U+00E1> for Armero and in [[Cali]] for Chinchina, where medical teams gathered. Makeshift [[triage]] stations were established in Lerida, Guayabal, and Mariquita, and soon were overwhelmed with the sheer number of victims. The remaining victims were directed to Ibague's hospitals, as local institutions had already been destroyed or were at risk from further lahars.<ref name=MGueri/>
[[File:MexCity85quake.jpg|thumb|left|The Armero tragedy occurred just after the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]], responsible for the destruction of buildings such as this one.]]
The US government spent over $1&nbsp;million in aid, and US Ambassador to Colombia Charles S. Gillespie Jr. donated an initial $25,000 to Colombian disaster assistance institutions. The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance of the US Agency for International Development (AID) sent one member of the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS), along with an AID disaster-relief expert and 12&nbsp;helicopters with support and medical personnel from [[Panama]]. The US subsequently sent additional aircraft and supplies, including 500&nbsp;tents, 2,250&nbsp;blankets, and several tent repair kits. Twenty-four other nations contributed to the rescue and assistance of survivors. Ecuador supplied a mobile hospital, and Iceland's Red Cross sent $4,650. The French government sent their own medical supplies with 1,300&nbsp;tents. Japan sent $1.25&nbsp;million, along with eight doctors, nurses, and engineers, plus $50,000 to the United Nations for relief efforts.<ref name=CSM>{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1985/1119/acolum.html|title=Colombia's pleas for disaster aid draw worldwide response |work=Christian Science Monitor|date=November 19, 1985|accessdate=November 28, 2008}}</ref> Another $50,000 was donated by the [[Lions Clubs International|Lions Clubs International Foundation]].<ref>{{Cite document|url=http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/hkjo/view/18/1805272.pdf|title=Colombia, Mexico Tragedies: Lions Respond Through LCIF|publisher=[[Lions Club International]]|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}</ref>

Rescue efforts were hindered by the soft mud that was up to {{convert|4.6|m|ft|0|sp=us}} deep in some places,<ref name=HJ/> making it virtually impossible for anyone to transverse it without sinking in.<ref name=DE/> To make the situation worse, the highway connected to Armero and several bridges to it had been demolished by the lahars.<ref name=HJ>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uV0sAAAAIBAJ&sjid=m84EAAAAIBAJ&pg=4542,4333411|title=20,000 Colombians Killed in Fiery Eruption|date=November 15, 1985|work=[[Herald-Journal]]|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}</ref> It took twelve hours for the first survivors to be rescued, so those with serious but treatable injuries probably died before the rescuers arrived. Because Armero's hospital was destroyed in the eruption, helicopters moved survivors to nearby hospitals. Six local towns set up makeshift emergency relief clinics, consisting of treatment areas and shelters for the homeless. To help with the treatment, physicians and rescue teams came from all over the country.<ref name=DE>Desjarlais and Eisenberg, p. 30.</ref> Of the 1244 patients spread over the clinics, 150 died from infection or associated [[complication (medicine)|complications]]. Had antibiotics been readily available and all of their lacerations been thoroughly cleaned, many of these people could have been saved.<ref name=Marti/>

On November 20, 1985, one week later, rescue efforts began to cease. Nearly 4,000&nbsp;relief workers and rescue team members were still searching for survivors, with little hope of finding any. By then, the official death toll was registered at 22,540&nbsp;people; additional counts showed that 3,300 were missing, 20,000&nbsp;homeless, and 4,000&nbsp;injured. Looters raided the ruins and survivors faced concerns of typhus and yellow fever. For most of the relief workers, their job was over.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EFshAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qoUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1998,7105606&dq=armero+tragedy&hl=en|title=Rescue hopes fade in volcano tragedy|date=November 20, 1985|accessdate=July 28, 2010|work=[[Tri-City Herald]]}}</ref>

The eruption was used as an example for psychiatric recuperation after natural disasters by Robert Desjarlais and Leon Eisenberg in their work ''World Mental Health: Problems and Priorities in Low-Income Countries''. The authors were concerned that only initial treatment for the survivors' [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] was conducted. One study showed that the victims of the eruption suffered from anxiety and depression, which can lead to alcohol abuse, marital problems and other social issues.<ref name=DE/> Rafael Ruiz, an Army Major who briefly served as Armero's provisional mayor after the disaster, stated that there were survivors who, due to the trauma of the event, were "jittery", experienced "nightmares", and suffered from "emotional problems." He added that the progress made by Christmas of 1985 was considerable, but that there was "still a long way to go."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=de8vAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gfsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7004,2182097|title=Christmas sorrowful for mudslide survivors|author=Gallardo, Eduardo|date=December 22, 1985|accessdate=July 22, 2010|work=[[Lakeland Ledger]]}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
[[File:VolcanoRuiz.jpg|thumb|Nevado del Ruiz roughly two weeks after the eruption took place]]
A lack of preparation for the disaster contributed to the high death toll. Armero had been built on an [[alluvial fan]]<ref name=Mileti1/> that had been overrun by historic mudflows; authorities had ignored a hazard-zone map that showed the potential damage to the town from lahars. Residents stayed inside their dwellings to avoid the falling ash, as local officials had instructed them to do, not thinking that they might be buried by the mudflows.<ref name="usgs hazard map"/>

The disaster gained international notoriety due in part to a photograph taken by photographer Frank Fournier of a young girl named [[Omayra S<U+00E1>nchez]], who was trapped beneath rubble for three days before she died.<ref name=Omayra/> Following the eruption relief workers gathered around the girl, speaking with her and listening to her responses. She attracted the attention of the reporters at the site because of her sense of dignity and courage, and caused controversy when people wondered why the media workers had not saved her (which was impossible without equipment). An appeal to the government for a pump to lower the water around her was left unanswered, and she succumbed to [[gangrene]] and hypothermia after 60 hours of being trapped. Her death epitomized the tragic nature of the Armero disaster <U+2013> she could have been saved had the government responded promptly and addressed the concerns over the volcano's potency.<ref name=Omayra>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4231020.stm|title=Picture power: Tragedy of Omayra Sanchez|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=September 30, 2005|accessdate=July 20, 2010}}</ref> The photograph earned the World Press Photo of the Year for "capturing the event of greatest journalistic importance".<ref name=ZA>{{cite web|url=http://lasa.international.pitt.edu/members/congress-papers/lasa2009/files/ZeidermanAustin.pdf|title=Life at Risk: Biopolitics, Citizenship, and Security in Colombia|author=Zeiderman, Austin|work=2009 Congress of the Latin American Studies Association|date=June 11, 2009|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}</ref>

===Controversy===
Concerns over the alleged negligence of local officials to alert locals of the volcano's threat led to controversy. The mayor of Armero (Ramon Rodriguez) and other local officials had tried to bring the volcano's potential to the attention of the Colombian government, but to no avail. For months, Rodriguez appealed to various officials, including congressmen and the Governor of Tolima Department. Rodriguez once referred to the volcano as a "time bomb" and told reporters that he believed an eruption would disrupt the natural dam above Armero, resulting in floods. Despite his persistence, only one congressman managed to inquire about the reality of the situation. Reports from the Colombian Minister of Mines, Minister of Defence, and Minister of Public Works "all asserted that the government was aware of the risk from the volcano and was acting to protect the population". The lack of responsibility for the disaster prompted lawmakers to campaign for Tolima's governor (Eduardo Alzate Garcia) to resign. In the media, similar thoughts and questions were hotly debated. One of the most aggressive campaigns came from a mass funeral in Ibague for the victims, claiming that "The volcano didn't kill 22,000&nbsp;people. The government killed them."<ref name=OtCi>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=36YyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=j-8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1248,1269632|title=Three weeks after volcano tragedy Colombia shrouded in controversy|date=December 12, 1985|author=Montalbano, William D.|work=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|accessdate=July 31, 2010}}</ref>

The volcano continues to pose a serious threat to nearby towns and villages. Of the threats, the one with the most potential for danger is that of small-volume eruptions, which can destabilize glaciers and trigger lahars.<ref name=Thouret>{{cite conference |author=Thouret, Jean-Claude, Murcia, A, Salinas, R, ''et al.'' |title=Stratigraphy and quaternary eruptive history of the Ruiz-Tolima volcanic massif, Colombia.
