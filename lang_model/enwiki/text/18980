[[The Beatles]]' residency in [[Hamburg]], the German city where [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]], [[Stuart Sutcliffe ]] and [[Pete Best]] regularly performed at a series of four different clubs during the period August 1960 to December 1962, was a chapter in the group's history which honed their performance skills, widened their reputation, and led to their first recording, which brought them to the attention of [[Brian Epstein]].

The Beatles booking agent, [[Allan Williams]], decided to send the group to Hamburg when another group he managed, Derry and The Seniors, proved successful there. Having no permanent drummer at the time, they recruited Best a few days before their departure. They initially lived in squalid conditions, sleeping in an unheated storeroom behind the screen of a cinema, in an area renowned for gangsters and prostitutes. After breaking their contract by playing at another club, Harrison was deported for being under-age, and McCartney and Best were arrested and deported for attempted arson.

In Hamburg The Beatles first met [[Astrid Kirchherr]], who was instrumental in the adoption of the famous [[Beatle haircut]]. During their time in Hamburg bass player Sutcliffe decided to leave the group to continue his studies. In April 1962, less than a year after leaving the group, Sutcliffe died of a brain haemorrhage.

==Hamburg in the 1960s==
Hamburg had once been Germany's main seaport, the third largest in the world, but in 1944 virtually the entire city had been reduced to rubble by World War II bombing raids. By 1960, when The Beatles arrived, the Hamburg that had grown up from the ruins had established its reputation throughout Europe as a city of vice and criminal activity.<ref> Pawlowski (1990), p.24</ref>

===Leaving Liverpool===
Williams, a 29-year-old Liverpool businessman and promoter, had sent his leading group to Hamburg, Derry and The Seniors (later known as Howie Casey and The Seniors)<ref name="IntheBeginningp1">{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Harry |url=http://www.triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/a-z/howiecasie.shtml |title= In the Beginning...

Williams started promoting concerts for The Beatles in May 1960, after they had played at his Jacaranda club in Liverpool,<ref name="CynthiaJohnp64">Lennon (2006) p64</ref> and offered The Beatles the Hamburg bookings.<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVDEpisode1"> The Beatles, Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:38:45) Harrison talking about the offer to play in Hamburg.</ref><ref name="Spitzp202"> Spitz (2005) p202</ref><ref name="BillHarryPage4">{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Harry |url=http://triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/a-z/rorystorm-hurricanes4.shtml |title=While My Guitar Gently Weeps: The Tragic Story of Rory Storm & the Hurricanes (page 4) |publisher=[[Bill Harry]] |accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref> He booked them into [[Bruno Koschmider]]'s Indra club in Hamburg for a season of bookings starting on 12 August 1960, but said that he was not impressed with them as a musical group, and hoped to find a better act to follow them.<ref name="MilesPage56">  Miles (1997) p56</ref><ref name="HamburgBeatleClubs">{{cite web|url=http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://webs.wichita.edu/mschneegurt/hamburg/kaiserkeller.gif&imgrefurl=http://webs.wichita.edu/mschneegurt/hamburg/hamburg.html&h=254&w=355&sz=65&hl=en&start=1&tbnid=XuBKiGVW2CiqFM:&tbnh=87&tbnw=121&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dkaiserkeller%26svnum%3D10%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26sa%3DG|title=Photos of Clubs in Hamburg|publisher=images.google.co.uk|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref><ref name="Spitzp203"> Spitz (''The Beatles'') 2005. p203</ref>

As The Beatles had no permanent drummer, McCartney looked around for someone to fill the Hamburg position, which was difficult, as Lennon later said that drummers were "few and far between", because a set of drums was an expensive item.<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVDEpisode1"> The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:39:18) Lennon talking about drummers.</ref> Harrison had seen Best playing with The Black Jacks in [[The Casbah Coffee Club]]<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVDEpisode1"> The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:39:01) Harrison talking about having seen Pete Best play drums.</ref>  (which was run by his mother, [[Mona Best]]). He was regarded as a steady drummer, playing the [[bass drum]] on all four [[beat]]s in the [[Bar (music)|bar]], which pushed the rhythm,<ref name="Spitzp204"> Spitz (2005) p204</ref> and was known in Liverpool at the time as being "mean, moody, and magnificent" by female fans,<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVDEpisode1"> The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:39:07) McCartney talking about Best and his reputation.</ref> which convinced McCartney he would be good for the group.<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD"> (''The Beatles Anthology'') DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:39:26) McCartney talking Best<U+2019>s reputation in Liverpool</ref> After The Black Jacks broke up, McCartney asked Best to go to Hamburg, telling him they would earn <U+00A3>15 per week each.<ref name="MilesPage57"/><ref name="CynthiaJohnp69-70"> Lennon (2006) pp69-70</ref> Best had the chance to go to a teacher-training college, as he had passed his school [[exam]]s<U+2014>unlike Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, who had failed most of theirs<U+2014>but decided that playing in Hamburg would be a better career move.<ref name="Spitzp6"> Spitz (2005) p6</ref> 

The [[St. Pauli]] quarter of Hamburg, where the Indra club was located, was well-known as an area where prostitutes were to be found, and was a dangerous place for anyone that looked different from the usual clientele.<ref name="Spitzp221"> Spitz (2005) p221</ref> McCartney's father, [[Jim and Mary McCartney|Jim McCartney]], was therefore reluctant to let the teenage Paul go to Hamburg.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp69-70"> Lennon (2006) pp69-70</ref> However, as the money his son would earn was more than he earned himself, he finally agreed, but only after a visit from Williams, who said that Jim "shouldn't worry".<ref name="MilesPage57">  Miles (1997) p57.</ref><ref name="Spitzp205"> Spitz (2005) p205</ref> Lennon's aunt, [[Mimi Smith]], was also reluctant to allow Lennon to go to Hamburg, wanting Lennon to continue his studies, but Lennon placated her by explaining the amount he would earn.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp70-71"> Lennon (2006) pp70-71</ref> 

Best had an [[audition]] in Williams' Jacaranda club on 15 August 1960,<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVDEpisode1"> The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:39:31) Harrison talking about Best<U+2019>s audition.</ref>  and travelled to Hamburg the next day as a member of The Beatles.<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD"> (''The Beatles Anthology'') DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:39:49) Harrison talking about the audition with Best</ref><ref>[http://triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/archives/my-beatle-days.shtml My Beatle Days, by Pete Best] triumphpc.com - Retrieved 26 November 2007 </ref> Williams later admitted that the audition with Best was not needed, as The Beatles hadn't found any other drummer willing to travel to Hamburg, but didn't tell Best in case he asked for more money.<ref name="Goldsmithp46"> Goldsmith (2004) p46</ref> The group would be paid about <U+00A3>100 per week, which was much more than promoters in Liverpool paid, but to save money Williams drove the group and their equipment in his [[Austin Motor Company|Austin Minivan]], which was loaded by crane onto a ferry at [[Harwich]] on 16 August 1960, and landed at the [[Hook of Holland]]. 

The Beatles, Williams and his wife Beryl, her brother Barry Chang, and 'Lord Woodbine' were in the minivan, along with Georg Sterner (Koschmider's translator and later a waiter) making a total of ten people, which resulted in a journey that was both uncomfortable and dangerous.<ref name="BeatlesattheIndracont ">{{cite web |first= |last= |url= http://www.triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/beatles/beatles_indra3.shtml |title=Beatles at the Indra (page 3) |publisher=Bill Harry/Mersey Beat Ltd. |accessdate=2009-06-10}}</ref> As Williams had not obtained work permits for Germany, everyone pretended to be students on holiday,<ref name="IndraMusicClub">{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Hillman |url=http://www.hillmanweb.com/BEATLES/indra.html |title=Indra Music Club  (Quotations taken fron ''The Beatles Anthology'')  |publisher=Hillmanweb  |accessdate=2009-05-15}}</ref><ref name="FabFourHangouts">{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Hillman |url= http://www.hillmanweb.com/BEATLES/reeper.html |title=Early '60s ~ Part V: Fab Four Hangouts (Quotations taken fron ''The Beatles Anthology'')  |publisher=Hillmanweb  |accessdate=2009-05-15}}</ref><ref name="TimelineTheBeatlesinHamburg">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://anothergirl83.tripod.com/id42.html |title= Timeline...The Beatles in Hamburg |publisher=tripod |accessdate=2009-05-14}}</ref> although work permits were later obtained after their arrival.<ref name="JohnLennonsHamburgWorkPermits">{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Vallance |url=http://www.jimvallance.com/03-projects-folder/john-lennon-visa-folder/lennon-visa-main-page.html |title=John Lennon's Hamburg Work Permits |publisher=Jim Vallance |accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref>
Note: 'Lord Woodbine' and Williams ran a Strip Club called New Cabaret Artistes club at 174a Upper Parliament Street, Liverpool. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe once played backing music for "Janice the Stripper" there, in July 1960.<ref name="ALittleBare">{{cite web |first=Paul |last=McCartney |url=http://mersey-beat.com/archives/littlebare.shtml |title=A Little Bare |publisher=Bill Harry/Mersey Beat Ltd. |accessdate=2009-06-10}}</ref>

==Hamburg clubs==
In the early 1960s, the Hamburg scene revolved around The Kaiserkeller, The Top Ten, The Star-Club, The Beer-Shop, The Mambo, The Holle, The Wagabond (pronounced [[vagabond]] in German) and The Pacific Hotel, as well as the less popular clubs Grannies, The Ice Cream Shop, Chugs, and Sacha's. The Reeperbahn and the Grosse Freiheit were decorated with neon lights, with posters advertising the performers in the clubs. Each club had a doorman whose job was to entice customers inside, as the drinks were expensive (for [[Babycham]] and watered-down beer). Customers who wouldn<U+2019>t, or couldn<U+2019>t afford to pay were dealt with severely by being beaten and then thrown out.<ref name=" Hamburg2p1">{{cite web |first=Mike |last=Hart |url=http://www.triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/archives/hamburg2.shtml |title= Hamburg 2 (p1) |publisher=Triumph PC |accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref>

===The Indra and Kaiserkeller===
[[Image:Indra-Club-Hamburg.png|thumb|left|The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.]]
The Beatles arrived very early in the morning on 17 August 1960, but had no trouble finding the St. Pauli area of Hamburg, as it was so well-known.<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVDEpisode1"> The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:41:14) McCartney talking about arriving in Hamburg.</ref> Unfortunately The Indra Club (58 Grosse Freiheit) was closed, so a manager from a neighbouring club found someone to open it up, and the group slept on the red leather seats in the alcoves.<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVDEpisode1"> The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:41:47) McCartney talking about sleeping in the club on the first night.</ref> The group first played at the club the same night, but were told they had to sleep in a small cinema's storerom, which was cold and noisy, being directly behind the screen of the cinema, the Bambi Kino.<ref name="IndraMusicClub"/> McCartney later said, "We lived backstage in the Bambi Kino, next to the toilets, and you could always smell them. The room had been an old storeroom, and there were just concrete walls and nothing else. No heat, no wallpaper, not a lick of paint; and two sets of bunk beds, with not very much covers<U+2014>[[Union Jack]] flags<U+2014>we were frozen."<ref name="Early60sPartIIDigs">{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Hillman |url=http://www.hillmanweb.com/BEATLES/digs.html |title=Early '60s ~ Part II: Digs (Quotations taken fron ''The Beatles Anthology'') |publisher=Hillmanweb  |accessdate=2009-05-15}}</ref> Lennon put it, "We were put in this pigsty. We were living in a toilet, like right next to the ladies' toilet. We'd go to bed late and be woken up next day by the sound of the cinema show and old German fraus [women] pissing next door."<ref name="IndraMusicClub"/> After having been awoken in this fashion, the group members were then obliged to use cold water from the urinals for washing and shaving.<ref> Pawlowski (1990) p25</ref> 

Harrison remembered The Reeperbahn and Grosse Freiheit as the best thing the group had ever seen, as it had so many clubs, neon lights, and restaurants, although also saying: "The whole area was full of transvestites and prostitutes and gangsters, but I couldn't say that they were the audience.<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVDEpisode1"> The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:43:14) Harrison talking about Hamburg<U+2019>s gangsters and hookers.</ref> Hamburg was really like our apprenticeship, learning how to play in front of people."<ref name="Reeperbahn">{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Hillman |url= http://www.hillmanweb.com/BEATLES/reeper.html (Quotations taken fron ''The Beatles Anthology'') |title=Reeperbahn  |publisher=Hillmanweb  |accessdate=2009-05-15}}</ref>
Best remembered the Indra as being a depressing place that was filled with a few tourists, and having heavy, old, red curtains that made it seem shabby compared to the larger Kaiserkeller, a club also owned by Koschmider and located nearby at 36 Grosse Freiheit.<ref name="Spitzp208"> Spitz (2005) p208</ref> After the closure of the Indra because of complaints about the noise, The Beatles played in the Kaiserkeller starting on 4 October 1960.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp76"> Cynthia Lennon (''John'') 2006. p76</ref><ref name="MilesPage57-58">  Miles (1997) pp57-8</ref> 

====Performances====
Their playing schedule required them to perform seven days a week, with one hour off between each 60 minute set.<ref name="TimelineTheBeatlesinHamburg"/> Willie Limpinski, Koschmider's business manager, decided that the Kaiserkeller would  attract more customers if it presented continuous live music.<ref name="IntheBeginningp3">{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Harry |url=http://www.triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/a-z/howiecasie3.shtml |title= In the Beginning... There Was Howie Casie & The Seniors (p3) |publisher=Triumph PC |accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref> Lennon said: "We had to play for hours and hours on end. Every song lasted twenty minutes and had twenty solos in it. That's what improved the playing. There was nobody to copy from. We played what we liked best and the Germans like it as long as it was loud."<ref name="IndraMusicClub"/> 

The Beatles had been used to simply standing still when they had performed in Liverpool, but Koschmider would come to the front of the stage and loudly shout <U+201C>Mach schau, mach schau!<U+201D> (Make a show for the customers). Harrison explained that this prompted Lennon to <U+201C>dance around like a gorilla, and we<U+2019>d all knock our heads together.<U+201D> <ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVDEpisode1"> The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:45:48) Harrison talking about <U+201C>Mach schau<U+201D>.</ref> As Best had been the only one to take [[O-Level]] German at school, he could communicate with Koschmider and the clientele better than the rest of the group,<ref name="CynthiaJohnp77"> Lennon (2006) p77</ref> and was invited to sing a speciality number called "[[Peppermint Twist]]" (while McCartney played the drums) but Best complained that he always felt uncomfortable being at the front of the stage.<ref>[http://www.eskimo.com/~bpentium/beatles/besttape/besttape.html Best and "Peppermint Twist"] eskimo.com - Retrieved 26 November 2007 </ref>

In early October 1960, Storm and The Hurricanes were free to travel to Hamburg, replacing Derry and The Seniors at the [[Kaiserkeller]]. They arrived in Hamburg on 1 October 1960, having negotiated to be paid more than The Seniors or The Beatles.<ref name="Spitzp201"> Spitz (2005) p201</ref> They played five or six 90-minute sets every day, alternating with The Beatles.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp76"/><ref name="Spitzp216"> Spitz (2005) p216</ref> Williams warned The Beatles about the competition they would face by playing in the same club as The Hurricanes by saying, "You'd better pull your socks up because Rory Storm and the Hurricanes are coming in, and you know how good they are. They're going to knock you for six."<ref name="IndraMusicClub"/> When Storm and The Hurricanes arrived in Hamburg, they were appalled at the living conditions The Beatles and other groups like Howie Casey and The Seniors (who were sleeping in one room at the back of the Kaiserkeller) had to put up with,<ref name="CaseyOfficialWebsite">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.howiecasey.com/ |title=Howie Casey Official Website |publisher=Howie Casey  |accessdate=2009-05-15}}</ref> so they booked into Hamburg's [[Centres for Seafarers|Seamens' Mission]].<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVDEpisode1"> The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:42:17) Starr talking about living conditions.</ref>

====Violence, conflict and close encounters====
The stage of the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood balanced on the top of beer crates, so the two groups made a bet to see to who would be the first to break it.<ref name="Spitzp219"> Spitz (2005) p219</ref> After punishing the stage for days, a slight crack appeared, and when Storm jumped off the top of the upright piano it finally broke.<ref name="Spitzp219"> Spitz (2005) p219</ref> Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne remembered that as Storm hit the stage, it cracked loudly and formed a V-shape around Storm. He disappeared into it, and all the amplifiers and Starr's cymbals slid into the hole. Koschmider was furious, and had to replace the live music with a juke box. Both groups went across the road to ''Harold's cafe'' for breakfast on the Grosse Freiheit,<ref name="FabFourHangouts">{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Hillman |url=http://www.hillmanweb.com/BEATLES/places.html |title=Early '60s ~ Part V: Fab Four Hangouts (Quotations taken fron ''The Beatles Anthology'')  |publisher=Hillmanweb  |accessdate=2009-05-15}}</ref> but were followed by Koschmider's doormen, armed with [[Blackjack (weapon)|coshes]], who beat them all as punishment.<ref name="Spitzp221"> Spitz 2005 p221</ref><ref name="Spitzp220"> Spitz (2005) p220</ref> 

[[Horst Fascher]] (born 1936, Hamburg) was Koschmider's nightclub [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]], who had been the 1959 German featherweight boxing champion, but his career was cut short after he unintentionally killed a sailor in a street fight.<ref name="HeadyDaysofRock&Roll">{{cite web |first=David |last=Crossland |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,400870,00.html|title=Hamburg's Heady Days of Rock & Roll |publisher=Der Spiegel |date=2006-02-15 |accessdate=2009-05-14}}</ref> He later became a friend of The Beatles, and protected them from drunken customers.<ref name="MancalledHorst">{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Harry |url=http://www.triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/beatles/horst.shtml |title=A Man called Horst |publisher=Triumph pc |date=[[1999-08-20]] |accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref> Lennon occasionally urinated out of his apartment<U+2019>s window onto the street below, and often started arguments with the audience, so that eventually one member of the audience would jump on stage to hit him, but it was Fascher<U+2019>s job to protect Lennon and the group.<ref name="HeadyDaysofRock&Roll"/> Fascher remembered Lennon often greeting the audience with a "Heil [[Hitler]]",<ref name="Spitzp217"> Spitz (2005) p217</ref> and a Nazi salute: "He'd pull out a black comb and pretend it was a moustache<U+2026> people laughed." <ref name="HeadyDaysofRock&Roll"/> 

Lennon was missing for a performance one evening, and Fascher found him in the toilet with a woman. He broke up the t<U+00EA>te-<U+00E0>-t<U+00EA>te with a bucket of cold water which he threw over them both, and ordered Lennon onto the stage. Lennon was furious, and complained that he couldn<U+2019>t go on stage dripping wet. Fascher snapped back: "I don't give a shit, you're going onstage and I don't care if you do it naked." A short time later the audience was roaring with laughter. Fascher ran to see what the commotion was, and saw Lennon playing guitar, but only wearing underpants with a toilet seat around his neck.<ref name="HeadyDaysofRock&Roll"/> (Epstein later asked Liverpool journalist [[Bill Harry]] not to publish photos showing Lennon walking along the Reeperbahn in his underpants).<ref name="InvestigationMyth">{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Krasker |url=http://www.iol.ie/~beatlesireland/Beatles%20Bits/Promo/investigationofamyth.html |title=The Beatles - Investigation of a Myth

Fascher sang lead vocals with the group on "[[Be Bop A Lula]]", and "[[Hallelujah I Love Her So]]", and his alliance with The Beatles continued, as he later went to work at The Star-Club.<ref name="HeadyDaysofRock&Roll"/> Marsden, of Gerry Marsden and The Pacemakers, remembered visiting a Hamburg brothel in Herbertstrasse with Lennon: "We paid our money, went in and sat down. This guy came out with the biggest lady we had ever seen in our lives. She looked like a bus with a bra on. We ran out that door so quick we didn't hear it shut.

====Growing performance skills====
According to McCartney, Sutcliffe was a "typical art student", with bad skin and [[Acne vulgaris|pimples]], but his reputation grew after he began wearing tight trousers and dark [[Ray-Ban Wayfarer|Ray-Ban]] sunglasses.<ref name="Milesp65">  Miles (1997) p65</ref> Sutcliffe's high spot was singing "[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]", which drew more applause than when the other Beatles sang, increasing the friction between himself and McCartney. Lennon also started to criticize Sutcliffe; making jokes about Sutcliffe's size and playing.<ref name="Spitzp242"> Spitz (2005) p242</ref> While Sutcliffe is often described in Beatles biographies as appearing very uncomfortable onstage, and often playing with his back to the audience, Best denies this, recalling Sutcliffe as usually good-natured and "animated" before an audience.<ref>[http://www.rickresource.com/rrp/petebest.html An Evening With Pete Best, Part I: The Interview] rickresource.com -  Retrieved: 20 Jan, 2007</ref>

The Beatles steadily improved during their time in Hamburg, and this was noticed by other musicians who were there at the time. McCartney recalled, "We got better and better and other groups started coming to watch us. The accolade of accolades was when Sheridan would come in from The Top Ten (the big club where we aspired to go) or when Rory Storm or Ringo [Starr] would hang around to watch us. "[[What'd I Say]]" [the [[Ray Charles]] song] was always the one that really got them."<ref name="IndraMusicClub"/> The song was often played by the group, and was once played for 90 minutes non-stop, with group members walking off stage to wash and drink before returning.<ref name="JohnLennonByDominicTurner">{{cite web |first=Dominic  |last=Turner |url=http://www.rockabilly.nl/references/messages/john_lennon.htm |title=John Lennon (By Dominic Turner)  |publisher=Dik de Heer |date=2006-02-15 |accessdate=2009-05-15}}</ref> Sutcliffe wrote a letter to his mother saying, "We have improved a thousand-fold since our arrival and Allan Williams, who is here at the moment, tells us that there is no group in Liverpool to touch us."<ref name="IndraMusicClub"/>

In late October 1960, The Beatles left Koschmider's club to work at the Top Ten Club,<ref name="MilesPage71-72"> Miles (1997) pp71<U+2013>72</ref> as Eckhorn offered the group more money, a better PA (with reverb and echo)<ref name="Spitzp229"> Spitz (2005) p229</ref> and a slightly better place to sleep (above the club itself) although by doing so the group broke their contract with Koschmider.<ref name="MilesPage71-72">  Miles (1997) pp71-72</ref><ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnPage93"> Lennon (2006) p93</ref> Koschmider then reported Harrison for working under the legal age limit (even though he had been working at Koschmider's club) and Harrison was deported on 30 November 1960.<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD"> (''The Beatles Anthology'') DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:49:56) Notice telling Harrison to leave Hamburg.</ref><ref> Lewisohn (''The Complete Beatles Chronicle'') 1996.  p24</ref><ref name="MilesPage72-73">  Miles (1997) pp72-73</ref> When Best and McCartney went back to the Bambi Kino to get their belongings they found it in almost total darkness. As a snub to Koschmider, McCartney and Best found a [[condom]] in their luggage, attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of the room, and set fire to it.<ref name="Spitzp230"> Spitz (2005) p230</ref> There was no real damage done, but Koschmider reported them both for attempted arson. McCartney: "One evening we were just walking down the Reeperbahn, when we heard this 'ta-ti-ti-ta', and then 'Komm mit mir!' ('Come with me!')".<ref name="Early60sPartIIDigs"/> 
Best and McCartney spent three hours in the Davidwache Police Station, and were deported on 4 December 1960.<ref name="Early60sPartIIDigs"/> Lennon's [[work permit]] was revoked a few days later and he went home by train, but as Sutcliffe had a [[Common cold|cold]], he stayed in Hamburg.<ref name="Spitzp230"> Spitz (2005) p230</ref> Sutcliffe later borrowed money from Kirchherr (his German girlfriend) for the airfare back to Liverpool in early January 1961.<ref name="Spitzp242"> Spitz (2005) p242</ref> Back in Liverpool, no one contacted each other for two weeks, but Best and his mother made numerous phone calls to Hamburg to recover the group's equipment.<ref name="Spitzp231"> Spitz (2005) p231</ref> 

Back in Liverpool, the group played an engagement on 17 December 1960, at The Casbah Coffee Club, with [[Chas Newby]] substituting for Sutcliffe,<ref name="SpitzPage4-5"> Spitz (2005) pp4<U+2013>5</ref> playing bass with them for four concerts.<ref>[http://www.beatlesource.com/savage/1960/1960.html Photo of Chas Newby] beatlesource.com - Retrieved 5 November 2007 </ref><ref name="Spitzp234"> Spitz (2005) p234</ref> Newby was shocked at the vast improvement of their playing and singing after the residency in Hamburg, and was struck by how powerful Best's drumming now was, pushing the group to play harder and louder.<ref name="Spitzp5"> Spitz (2005) p5</ref> (It was probably due to McCartney that Best developed a loud drumming style, as he would often tell Best in Hamburg to "Crank it up" = play as loud as possible).<ref name="Spitzp214"> Spitz (''The Beatles'') 2005. p214</ref>

After Harrison turned 18 and the immigration problems had been solved, The Beatles went back to Hamburg for another residency at the [[Top Ten Club]], playing from 1 April to 1 July 1961. To secure their return, Eckhorn paid 158[[Deutsche Mark|DM]] to the German authorities, which was the cost of deporting McCartney and Best back to Liverpool the previous winter.<ref> Lewisohn (1996) p31</ref> Fellow musician, [[Tony Sheridan]], later remembered the living conditions at the club: <U+201C>John, George, Paul, Stuart and Pete and I were booked to open the smart Top Ten in the Reeperbahn.

Sutcliffe decided to leave The Beatles to concentrate on his art studies and to be with Kirchherr, so McCartney (unwillingly) took over as bass player for the group.<ref name="Milesp74-75"> Miles (1997) pp74-75.</ref> Sutcliffe later enrolled at the Hamburg College of Art under the tutelage of the [[pop art]]ist [[Eduardo Paolozzi]].<ref name="Milesp65">  Miles (1997)  p65</ref> He lent McCartney his [[H<U+00F6>fner]] President 500/5 model bass guitar but asked McCartney not to change the strings around, so McCartney had to play it upside down, until he could buy a specially made left-handed H<U+00F6>fner bass of his own.<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD"> (''The Beatles Anthology'') DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:28:02) Harrison and McCartney talking about Sutcliffe<U+2019>s first bass guitar. </ref><ref name="Milesp74-75">  Miles (1997) pp74-75</ref><ref name="Sutcliffe's cheque book">[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/cheque.asp  Sutcliffe's cheque book -] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 13 May 2007 </ref><ref>[http://www.rockmine.com/Stu2.html Sutcliffe's President Bass] rockmine.com - Retrieved: 9 May 2007 </ref> McCartney bought his first H<U+00F6>fner Violin bass guitar (model 500/1) from  the Steinway-Haus Music Store (Colonnaden 29) Lennon bought a Rickenbacker guitar (1958 Model 325) and Harrison bought a Gibson amplifier.<ref name="THEGIGSPartV">{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Hillman |url=http://www.hillmanweb.com/BEATLES/other.html |title=The Gigs: Part V (Quotations taken fron ''The Beatles Anthology'')  |publisher=Hillmanweb  |accessdate=2009-05-15}}</ref> 
 
The matching lilac jackets, made by McCartney's next-door neighbour in Liverpool to be worn as stage clothes, were soon threadbare, as were any other items of clothing,<ref name="IndraMusicClub"/> so the group bought cowboy boots, jeans and black leather jackets and trousers, from Paul Hundertmark's (Spielbudenplatz 9) and a tailor's shop at Thadenstrasse 6.<ref name="FabFourHangouts">{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Hillman |url=http://www.hillmanweb.com/BEATLES/places.html |title=Early '60s ~ Part V: Fab Four Hangouts (Quotations taken fron ''The Beatles Anthology'')  |publisher=Hillmanweb  |accessdate=2009-05-15}}</ref> Lennon said: "We had a bit more money the second time so we bought leather pants [and cowboy boots] and we looked like four [[Gene Vincent]]s.<ref name="TopTenMusicClub"/>

===The Star-Club===

On 13 April 1962, The Beatles were booked as the opening act for the launch of a new club. The Star-Club, opened by Manfred Weissleder, had a capacity for two thousand people, as well as cinema-style seating.<ref name="TheStarClub">{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Hillman |url=http://www.hillmanweb.com/BEATLES/starclub.html|title=The Star Club  (Quotations taken fron ''The Beatles Anthology'')  |publisher=Hillmanweb  |accessdate=2009-05-15}}</ref> When The Beatles were booked to play there, [[Neil Aspinall]] left his job to become The Beatles' permanent road manager, as he was earning more money driving them around than he was earning by being an [[accountant]], and had his van ferried to Hamburg.<ref name="Beat"> [http://triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/beatles/neilaspinall.shtml First meeting with George Harrison - Merseybeat] triumphpc.com - Retrieved 11 February 2007 </ref><ref>[http://www.beatlesource.com/savage/1960/1960.html photo of Aspinall<U+2019>s van being loaded on the ferry to Hamburg] beatlesource.com - Retrieved 4 November 2007 </ref> The Beatles returned to Hamburg by plane to play from 13 April to 31 May 1962.<ref name="LewisohnChronicle69">Lewisohn (1996) p69</ref> Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death.<ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnp109"> Lennon (2006) p109</ref> 

By the time of their second Star-Club visit from 1-14 November 1962, Ringo Starr had become the group's drummer. The Beatles stayed at the Hotel Germania (Detlev-Bremer-Strasse 8), having the luxury of single rooms for the first time, and then stayed at the Hotel Pacific (Neuer Pferdemarkt 30) for another booking from 18-31 December 1962.<ref name="Early60sPartIIDigs"/> Harrison said: "We came back to play the Star-Club, a big place and fantastic because it had a great sound system. This time we had a hotel. I remember it was quite a long walk from the club, at the top of the Reeperbahn going back towards the city."<ref name="TheStarClub"/> Portions of their final performances were taped with a portable recorder by an associate of Ted "King Size" Taylor of The Dominoes, another group playing at the club. The tapes were released on Germany's [[Bellaphon Records|Bellaphon]] label in 1977 as ''The Beatles: [[Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962]],'' and subsequently re-released in various formats and titles.<ref name="TheStarClub"/>

===Sex, drugs and rock and roll===
McCartney explained that the whole group had only experienced sex with girls from Liverpool, but when they got to Hamburg the only women who hung around the clubs late at night were strippers, dancers, or prostitutes. Harrison (who was then only 17-years-old) called Hamburg, <U+201C>The naughtiest city in the world<U+201D>. <ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVDEpisode1"> The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:43:05) Harrison talking about Hamburg women and sex.</ref> McCartney said: <U+201C>By the time you got to Hamburg, a girlfriend there was likely to be a stripper, so to be suddenly involved with a hard-core striptease artist, who obviously knew a thing or two about sex... it was quite an eye-opener.<U+201D> <ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVDEpisode1"> The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:43:39) McCartney talking about Hamburg women and sex.</ref>

Looking back, Harrison said that the whole group would be <U+201C>frothing at the mouth,<U+201D> and would sometimes stay awake for days.<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVDEpisode1"> The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:44:29) Harrison talking about drugs in Hamburg.</ref> Lennon recalled, <U+201C>The waiters always had these pills [Preludin], so when they saw the musicians falling over with tiredness or drink, they<U+2019>d give you the pill.

Legitimate use of Preludin required a doctor's [[Medical prescription|prescription]] note, but Kirchherr's mother was able to obtain it from a local [[Pharmacist|chemist]] which supplied the drug without asking questions.<ref name="Milesp66">  Miles (1997) p66</ref> Epstein later asked the Star-Club owner, Weissleder, not to publish photographs showing the group playing with tubes of Preludin.<ref name="InvestigationMyth"/> 

Starr explained that [[Dexedrine]] too was in plentiful supply in Hamburg, as it was known to produce increased wakefulness and focus, in association with decreased fatigue, and decreased appetite.<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVDEpisode1"> The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:44:06) Starr talking about drugs in Hamburg.</ref>

==The first record release==
===Recording sessions===
[[Image:Nh66833.jpg|thumb|right|200px| The British cover of <U+201C>My Bonnie<U+201D>.]]
The first Beatles recording ever released, the single "[[My Bonnie]]", was made in Hamburg during the group's time at the Top Ten club. The recording came about when The Beatles were recruited by singer Sheridan, who also had a residency at the Top Ten club, to act as his [[Backup band|backing group]] on a series of recordings. The recordings were made for the German [[Polydor Records]] label<ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnp97"> Lennon (2006) p97</ref> and were produced by the famed bandleader [[Bert Kaempfert]],<ref name="LewisohnChronicle42">Lewisohn (1996) p42</ref> who had an instrumental hit called "Wonderland by Night" ("Wunderland bei Nacht") which reached number one in the U.S. in 1961, the same year he produced "My Bonnie". On 22 June 1961, Sheridan and The Beatles drove to [[Hamburg-Harburg]] (about 30 minutes from Hamburg) to record in the Friedrich-Ebert-Halle (auditorium/hall) and were paid 330 Deutschmarks (about $75) for the recording, although there was a second recording session on 23 June and a third session in May 1962. Kaempfert signed the group to a one-year Polydor contract<ref name="MyBeatleDays">{{cite web |first=Pete |last=Best |url=http://www.triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/archives/my-beatle-days.shtml |title= My Beatle Days |publisher=Triumph PC |accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref> at the first session on 22 June 1961.<ref name="THEGIGSPartV">{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Hillman |url=http://www.hillmanweb.com/BEATLES/other.html |title=The Gigs: Part V (Quotations taken fron ''The Beatles Anthology'')  |publisher=Hillmanweb  |accessdate=2009-05-15}}</ref><ref name="TheBeatlesinHamburg19601962">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://german.about.com/cs/music/a/beatleger_2.htm |title=The Beatles in Hamburg: 1960-1962  |publisher=about |accessdate=2009-05-14}}</ref>

On 31 October 1961, Polydor released "My Bonnie" (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur) which appeared on the German charts under the name "Tony Sheridan and The Beat Brothers"&mdash;a generic name used for whoever happened to be in Sheridan's backup group,<ref> Spitz (2005) p250</ref> although McCartney explained: "They didn't like our name and said, 'Change to The Beat Brothers, this is more understandable for the German audience.' We went along with it... it was a record."<ref name="TopTenMusicClub"/> The song was later released in the UK, on 5 January 1962.<ref name="Spitzp288"> Spitz (''The Beatles'') 2005. p288</ref><ref name="MyBonnie"> <U+201C>My Bonnie<U+201C> / <U+201C>The Saints<U+201C> 23 April 1962.

===Influence on Brian Epstein===
{{main|The Beatles: The Cavern Club and Brian Epstein}}
"My Bonnie" was to bring The Beatles to the attention of a key figure in their subsequent development and commercial success, [[Brian Epstein]]. In September 1961, Harrison had a German copy of the record, which Sutcliffe had sent to him, as he was still in Hamburg.<ref name="Spitzp252"/> Harrison loaned it to Bob Wooler (The Cavern Club DJ) who played it a various venues, when the members of the group lent it to him.<ref name="Spitzp252"> Spitz (2005) p252</ref> On 28 October 1961, the 27-year-old Epstein, manager of the record department in his father's NEMS music store in Whitechapel Street, Liverpool, was asked for the record by an 18-year-old boy, Raymond Jones. Epstein could find nothing on his files about The Beatles or the record, but the following day it was requested again by two girls, this time mentioning that The Beatles had been seen playing at the Cavern, a club in nearby Mathew Street.<ref name="Hill 2007 p15">{{harvnb|Hill|2007|p=15}}</ref> [[Alistair Taylor]] (Epstein's assistant) later said that he used Jones' name to order copies of the record himself.<ref name="Spitzp252"/> 

Mersey Beat founder Harry and McCartney later repudiated the story about Epstein not knowing who the Beatles were, as Harry had been talking to  Epstein about the group for a long time (being the group he promoted the most in ''Mersey Beat'') and by McCartney saying, <U+201C>Brian [Epstein] knew perfectly well who The Beatles were, they were on the front page of the second issue of ''Mersey Beat''.<U+201D><ref name="TheBirthofMerseyBeatp5">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.mersey-beat.com/ |title=The Birth of Mersey Beat (p5) |publisher=Bill Harry/Mersey Beat Ltd. |accessdate=2009-06-12}}</ref> Nevertheless, the interest in the record eventually led Epstein to make his way to the Cavern with Taylor, during lunch hour on 9 November 1961. He was initially repelled by the dark, damp club, but he congratulated the group on their performance.<ref>Pawlowski (1990), pp.39-40</ref>

==Kirchherr, Voormann, and Vollmer==
{{main|Astrid Kirchherr|Klaus Voormann}}
Kirchherr, [[Klaus Voormann]], and [[J<U+00FC>rgen Vollmer]] were early fans of The Beatles after they heard the group play in the Kaiserkeller. Kirchherr, Voormann's girlfriend, was initially horrified at the idea of spending any time in such a sordid district, but Voormann, after watching The Beatles several times without her, eventually persuaded her to come too.<ref>Pawlowski (1990) pp25-27</ref> After only having previously only listened to [[Trad jazz]], [[The Platters]], and [[Nat King Cole]], the [[Rock n' Roll]] that The Beatles played was totally new to them.<ref name="Spitzp222"> Spitz (''The Beatles'') 2005.  p222</ref><ref name="Milesp62"> Miles (1997) p62</ref> The three friends visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage.<ref name="Spitzp221"> Spitz (2005) p221</ref> Kirchherr, then 22 years old, later said: "It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them and to know them."<ref name="Spitzp223"> Spitz (2005) p223</ref> Sutcliffe was fascinated by Kirchherr, and Harry later wrote that when Kirchherr walked in, every head would immediately turn her way.<ref name="Spitzp222"/> Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly take his eyes off her when she had first walked into the club, and tried to talk to her during the next break, but she had already left. (This was due to the strict German law at the time which prohibited young people from frequenting bars after 10 o'clock at night.)<ref name="Spitzp221"/> 

Kirchherr asked The Beatles if they would mind letting her take photographs of them in a photo session, which impressed them, as other groups only had [[Snapshot (photography)|snapshots]] that were taken by friends. The next morning Kirchherr took photographs in a municipal park called "der Dom" which was close to the Reeperbahn.<ref name="Spitzp223"/><ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD"> (''The Beatles Anthology'') DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:47:16) Harrison talking their friends Kircherr, Voormannn and Volmer.</ref> Kirchherr started dating Sutcliffe, and they were engaged in November 1960.<ref name="Milesp65">Miles (1997) p65.</ref><ref name="Milesp64"> Miles (1997)  p64</ref><ref name="Spitzp224"> Spitz (''The Beatles'') 2005. p224.</ref>

Kirchherr is credited with inventing The Beatles' [[moptop]] haircut, although she personally disagrees.<ref name="Spitzp245"> Spitz (2005) p245</ref> In 1995, she told BBC Radio Merseyside: "All my friends in art school used to run around with this sort of what you call Beatles haircut, and my boyfriend then, Klaus Voormann, had this hairstyle, and Stuart [Sutcliffe] liked it very very much. He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the [[Brylcreem]] out of his hair and asking me to cut his hair for him. Pete [Best] has really curly hair and it wouldn't work."<ref name="InterviewBBCLiverpool">[http://members.aol.com/scottwheelerband/astrid.htm Kirchherr's interview on BBC Radio Merseyside's 500th ''On The Beat'' programme, Saturday 26 August 1995.</ref><ref>[http://www.genesis-publications.com/fame/liverpool.html "Liverpool Days" book] genesis-publications.com - Retrieved: 21 May 2007 </ref> After suffering blackouts and intense headaches, Sutcliffe was taken to a hospital on 10 April 1962<U+2014>Kirchherr rode with him in the ambulance<U+2014>but died before the ambulance reached the hospital.<ref name="lennonp110">Lennon (2006) p110</ref> Three days later Kirchherr met The Beatles at the Hamburg airport and told them Sutcliffe had died of a [[brain haemorrhage]].<ref name="Spitzp305"> Spitz (''The Beatles'') 2005. p305.</ref>

In 1966, Voormann was asked by Lennon to design the sleeve for The Beatles<U+00B4> album ''[[Revolver (album)|Revolver]]'', and also played bass on solo recordings by Lennon, Harrison, and Starr. In 1995, Voormann designed the artwork for the three-volume CD sets in [[The Beatles Anthology#Albums|The Beatles Anthology]] series. In 1999, Kirchherr published a book called ''Hamburg Days'' (a two-volume limited edition) containing a set of photographs by Kirchherr and "memory drawings" by Voormann of The Beatles time in Hamburg.<ref>[http://www.genesis-publications.com/books/ham/index.html Genesis books - Hamburg Days] genesis-publications.com - Retrieved: 23 May 2007 </ref>

==Later years==
The Beatles returned to Hamburg in June 1966, staying at the Tremsb<U+00FC>ttel castle (Schlosstrasse 10), and played two concerts in the Ernst-Merck-Halle on the 26 and 27 June.<ref name="Early60sPartIIDigs"/> Lennon later said, "I might have been born in Liverpool - but I grew up in Hamburg".<ref name="BeatleEchoesOntheReeperbahn">{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Hillman |url=http://www.hillmanweb.com/BEATLES/echoes.html |title=Beatle Echoes On the Reeperbahn (Quotations taken fron ''The Beatles Anthology'') |publisher=Hillmanweb  |accessdate=2009-05-15}}</ref>
Lennon made the door of J<U+00E4>ger-Passage at Wohlwillstrasse 22 famous in music history when he posed in front of it for a photo which was later used on the covers of the ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (John Lennon album)|Rock 'n' Roll]]'' and ''Rock 'n' Roll Sessions'' albums.

Individual Beatles later commented about their memories of Hamburg, with Lennon reflecting, "We'd outlived the Hamburg stage and wanted to pack that up. We hated going back to Hamburg those last two times. We'd had that scene. Brian [Epstein] made us go back to fulfil the contract...". Harrison, however, had some very positive memories of the period: "I'd have to say with hindsight that Hamburg bordered on the best of Beatles times. We didn't have any luxury, we didn't have any bathrooms or any clothes, we were pretty grubby, we couldn't afford anything, but on the other hand we weren't yet famous, so we didn't have to contend with the bullshit that comes with fame." McCartney was philosophical: "Hamburg was certainly a great childhood memory. But I think all things are enhanced by time. It was very exciting, though I think it felt better to me a little later in our career, once we'd started to get a bit of success with the records."<ref name="TheStarClub"/>

A memorial square, ''[[Beatles-Platz]]'', was constructed in Hamburg in 2008, containing five stainless steel sculptures of The Beatles.<ref name="GICPretoria">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.germanyandafrica.diplo.de/Vertretung/pretoria__dz/en/05__GL/Destination__Germany/Beatlerplatz.html |title=Beatles Memorial Square in Hamburg |publisher=GIC Pretoria |accessdate=2009-05-15}}</ref> Construction costs amounted to 550,000 euros ($776,000), of which 200,000 euros was provided by sponsors and donors. The idea of creating a memorial to The Beatles had been initiated in 2001 by Hamburg radio station Oldie 95. Hamburg's Mayor, Ole von Beust, said at the opening, "It is about time that Hamburg commemorated this great group." The square when illuminated resembles a spinning turntable.<ref name="BeatlesMemorialatLast">{{cite web |first=Dorit |last=Koch |url=http://www.efluxmedia.com/news_Hamburg_Gets_Its_Official_Beatles_Memorial_at_Last_24121.html |title=Hamburg Gets Its Official Beatles Memorial at Last
