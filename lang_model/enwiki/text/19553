'''Asperger syndrome''' (also '''Asperger's syndrome''', '''Asperger's disorder''', '''Asperger's''', '''AS''', or '''AD''') is one of several [[autistic spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD) characterized by difficulties in [[social interaction]] and by restricted and [[Stereotypy (psychiatry)|stereotyped]] interests and activities. AS is distinguished from the other ASDs in having no general [[language delay|delay in language]] or [[cognitive development]]. Although not mentioned in standard diagnostic criteria, [[motor skills disorder|motor clumsiness]] and atypical use of language are frequently reported.<ref name="McPartland"/><ref name="Baskin"/>

Asperger syndrome was named after [[Hans Asperger]] who, in 1944, described children in his practice who appeared to have normal [[Intelligence quotient|intelligence]] but lacked [[nonverbal communication]] skills, failed to demonstrate [[empathy]] with their peers, and were physically clumsy. Fifty years later, AS was recognized in the ''[[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]]'' (ICD-10), and in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-IV) as ''Asperger's Disorder''. Questions about many aspects of AS remain: for example, there is lingering doubt about the distinction between AS and [[high-functioning autism]] (HFA);<ref name="Klin"/> partly due to this, the [[prevalence]] of AS is not firmly established. The exact [[etiology|cause]] of AS is unknown, although research supports the likelihood of a [[genetics|genetic]] contribution, and [[neuroimaging|brain imaging]] techniques have identified structural and functional differences in specific regions of the brain.

There is no single treatment for AS, and the effectiveness of particular interventions is supported by only limited data. Intervention is aimed at improving symptoms and function. The mainstay of treatment is behavioral therapy, focusing on specific deficits to address poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines, and clumsiness. Most individuals with AS can learn to cope with their differences, but may continue to need moral support and encouragement to maintain an independent life.<ref name=NINDS>{{cite web |author= National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) |date=[[2007-07-31]] |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/asperger/detail_asperger.htm |accessdate=2007-08-24 |title= Asperger syndrome fact sheet}} NIH Publication No. 05-5624.</ref> Adults with AS have reached the highest levels of achievement in fields such as mathematics, physics and computer science.<ref name=AQ/> Researchers and people with AS have contributed to a shift in attitudes away from the notion that AS is a deviation from the norm that must be treated or cured, and towards the view that AS is a difference rather than a disability.

==Classification==
Asperger syndrome is one of the [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD) or [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are a [[spectrum disorder|spectrum of psychological conditions]] that are characterized by abnormalities of [[social interaction]] and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Like other psychological development disorders, ASD begins in infancy or childhood, has a steady course without remission or relapse, and has impairments that result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain.<ref name=ICD-10-F84.0>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf80.htm+f840 |date=2006 |accessdate=2007-06-25 |title= International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|edition=10th ed.

==Characteristics==
Asperger syndrome is distinguished by a pattern of symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of activities and interests, and by absence of delay in cognitive development and of general delay in language.<ref name=BehaveNet>{{cite book |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th ed., text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |date=2000 |isbn=0890420254 |chapter= Diagnostic criteria for 299.80 Asperger's Disorder (AD) |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm |accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], and [[Motor skills disorder|motor clumsiness]] are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis.<ref name=Klin>{{cite journal |journal= Rev Bras Psiquiatr |year=2006 |volume=28 |issue= suppl 1 |pages=S3<U+2013>S11 |title= Autism and Asperger syndrome: an overview |author= Klin A |pmid=16791390 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462006000500002&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en}}</ref> 

===Social interaction===
The lack of demonstrated empathy is possibly the most dysfunctional aspect of AS.<ref name=Baskin/> Individuals with AS experience difficulties in basic elements of [[Asperger syndrome and interpersonal relationships|social interaction]], which may include a failure to develop friendships or enjoy spontaneous interests or achievements with others, a lack of social or emotional reciprocity, and impaired [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal behaviors]] such as eye contact, facial expression, posture, and gesture.<ref name=McPartland>{{cite journal |author= McPartland J, Klin A |title= Asperger's syndrome |journal= Adolesc Med Clin |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=771<U+2013>88 |year=2006 |pmid=17030291 |doi=10.1016/j.admecli.2006.06.010}}</ref>

Unlike those with autism, people with AS are not usually withdrawn around others; they approach others, even if awkwardly, for example by engaging in a one-sided, long-winded speech about an unusual topic while being oblivious to the listener's feelings or reactions, such as signs of boredom or wanting to leave.<ref name=Klin/> This social awkwardness has been called "active, but odd".<ref name=McPartland/> This failure to react appropriately to social interaction may appear as disregard for other people's feelings, and may come across as insensitive. The cognitive ability of children with AS often lets them articulate social norms in a laboratory context,<ref name=McPartland/> where they may be able to show a theoretical understanding of other people<U+2019>s emotions; however, they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid real-life situations.<ref name=Klin/> People with AS may analyze and distill their observation of social interaction into rigid behavioral guidelines and apply these rules in awkward ways<U+2014>such as forced eye contact<U+2014>resulting in demeanor that appears rigid or socially na<U+00EF>ve. Childhood desires for companionship can be numbed through a history of failed social encounters.<ref name=McPartland/>

The [[hypothesis]] that individuals with AS are predisposed to violent or criminal behavior has been investigated and found to be unsupported by data.<ref name="McPartland"/><ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2007 |title= Offending behaviour in adults with Asperger syndrome |author= Allen D, Evans C, Hider A, Hawkins S, Peckett H, Morgan H |pmid=17805955 |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0442-9}}</ref> More evidence suggests children with AS are victims than suggests they are victimizers.<ref name=Tsatsanis/>

=== Restricted and repetitive interests and behavior ===
[[Image:Riboflavin_penicillinamide.jpg|thumb|Those with AS often display intense interests, such as this boy's fascination with molecular structure.]]
People with AS display behavior, interests, and activities that are restricted and repetitive and are sometimes abnormally intense or focused. They may stick to inflexible routines or rituals, move in stereotyped and repetitive ways, or preoccupy themselves with parts of objects.<ref name=BehaveNet/>

Pursuit of specific and narrow areas of interest is one of the most striking features of AS.<ref name=McPartland/> Individuals with AS may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as dinosaurs or deep fat fryers, without necessarily having genuine understanding of the broader topic.<ref name=McPartland/><ref name=Klin/> For example, a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography.<ref name=McPartland/> This behavior is typically apparent by grade school, typically age 5 or 6 in the US.<ref name=McPartland/> The entire family may become immersed in the narrow topic. Because topics such as dinosaurs often capture the interest of children, this symptom may go unrecognized, and may not be apparent until the interests become more unusual and focused over time.<ref name=Klin/>  

[[Stereotypy (psychiatry)|Stereotyped]] and repetitive motor behaviors are a core part of the diagnosis of AS and other ASDs.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2005 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=145<U+2013>58 |title= Repetitive behavior profiles in Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism |author= South M, Ozonoff S, McMahon WM |doi=10.1007/s10803-004-1992-8 |pmid=15909401}}</ref> They include hand movements such as flapping or twisting, and complex whole-body movements.<ref name=BehaveNet/> These are typically repeated in longer bursts and look more voluntary or ritualistic than [[tic]]s, which are usually faster, less rhythmical and less often symmetrical.<ref name=RapinTS>{{cite journal |author= Rapin I |title= Autism spectrum disorders: relevance to Tourette syndrome |journal= Adv Neurol |volume=85 |pages=89<U+2013>101 |year=2001 |pmid=11530449}}</ref>

===Speech and language===
Although children with AS acquire language skills without significant general delay, and the speech of those with AS typically lacks significant abnormalities, language acquisition and use is often atypical.<ref name=Klin/> Abnormalities include verbosity; abrupt transitions; literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance; use of [[metaphor]] meaningful only to the speaker; [[Auditory processing disorder|auditory perception deficits]]; unusually [[pedant]]ic, [[Register (linguistics)|formal]] or idiosyncratic speech; and oddities in [[loudness]], [[Tone (linguistics)|pitch]], [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], and [[rhythm]].<ref name=McPartland/>

Three aspects of communication patterns are of clinical interest: poor prosody, tangential and circumstantial speech, and marked verbosity. Although inflection and intonation may be less rigid or monotonic than in autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation; speech may be overly fast, jerky or loud. Speech may convey a sense of incoherence; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide context for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to monitor whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.<ref name=Klin/>

Children with AS may have an unusually sophisticated vocabulary at a young age and have been colloquially called "little professors", but have difficulty understanding metaphorical language and tend to use language literally.<ref name=McPartland/> Individuals with AS appear to have particular weaknesses in areas of nonliteral language that include humor, irony, and teasing. They usually understand the cognitive basis of [[humor]] but may not enjoy it due to lack of understanding of its intent.<ref name=Kasari/>

===Other symptoms===
Individuals with AS may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but can affect the individual or the family. These symptoms include atypical perception and problems with motor skills, sleep, and emotions.

Asperger<U+2019>s initial accounts<ref name = "McPartland"/> and other diagnostic schemes<ref name="EhlGill">{{cite journal |author= Ehlers S, Gillberg C |title= The epidemiology of Asperger's syndrome. A total population study |journal= J Child Psychol Psychiat |year=1993 |volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=1327<U+2013>50 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1993.tb02094.x |pmid=8294522 |url=http://www.asperger.org/MAAP_Sub_Find_It_-_Publications_Ehlers_and_Gillberg_Article.htm |accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref> include descriptions of [[motor skills disorder|motor clumsiness]].  Children with AS may be delayed in acquiring motor skills that require motor dexterity, such as bicycle riding or opening a jar, and may appear awkward or "uncomfortable in their own skin". They may be poorly coordinated, or have an odd or bouncy gait or posture, poor handwriting, or problems with visual-motor integration, visual-perceptual skills, and conceptual learning.<ref name="McPartland"/><ref name="Klin"/> They may show problems with [[proprioception]] (sensation of body position) on measures of [[apraxia]] (motor planning disorder), balance, [[tandem gait]], and finger-thumb apposition. There is no evidence that these motor skills problems differentiate AS from other high-functioning ASDs.<ref name= "McPartland"/>

Many accounts of individuals with AS and ASD report unusual sensory and perceptual skills and experiences. They may have superior performance in tasks like visual search problems that require processing of fine-grained features rather than entire configurations.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |date=2006 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=27<U+2013>43 |title= Enhanced perceptual functioning in autism: an update, and eight principles of autistic perception |author= Mottron L, [[Michelle Dawson|Dawson M]], Souli<U+00E8>res I, Hubert B, Burack J |doi=10.1007/s10803-005-0040-7 |pmid=16453071}}</ref> They may be unusually sensitive or insensitive to sound, light, touch, texture, taste, smell, pain, temperature, and other stimuli, and they may exhibit [[synesthesia]], for example, a smell may trigger perception of color;<ref>{{cite book |author= Bogdashina O |title= Sensory Perceptional Issues in Autism and Asperger Syndrome: Different Sensory Experiences, Different Perceptual Worlds |publisher= Jessica Kingsley |year=2003 |isbn=1843101661}}</ref> these sensory responses are found in other developmental disorders and are not specific to AS or to ASD.

==Causes==
{{see|Causes of autism}}
Asperger described common symptoms among his patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to AS. Although no specific gene has yet been identified, multiple factors are believed to play a role in the [[Expressivity|expression]] of autism, given the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] variability seen in this group of children.<ref name=McPartland/><ref name="Foster"/> Evidence for a genetic link is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading).<ref name=NINDS/> Most research suggests that all autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms, but AS may have a stronger genetic component than autism.<ref name="McPartland"/> There is probably a common group of genes where particular [[allele]]s render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.<ref name=NINDS/>

A few ASD cases have been linked to exposure to [[teratogen]]s (agents that cause [[birth defect]]s) during the first eight weeks from [[Human fertilization|conception]]. Alhough this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises very early in development.<ref name=Arndt>{{cite journal |journal= Int J Dev Neurosci |date=2005 |volume=23 |issue=2<U+2013>3 |pages=189<U+2013>99 |title= The teratology of autism |author= Arndt TL, Stodgell CJ, Rodier PM |doi=10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2004.11.001 |pmid=15749245}}</ref> Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=[[Michael Rutter|Rutter M]] |title= Incidence of autism spectrum disorders: changes over time and their meaning |journal= Acta Paediatr |volume=94 |issue=1 |date=2005 |pages=2<U+2013>15 |pmid=15858952}}</ref>

The current "gold standard" in diagnosing ASDs uses the [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised]] (ADI-R)<U+2014>a semistructured parent interview<U+2014>and the [[Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule]] (ADOS)<U+2014>a conversation and play-based interview with the child.<ref name=McPartland/>

==Diagnosis==

Standard diagnostic criteria require impairment in social interaction, and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors and interests, without significant delay in language or cognitive development.

Although their intelligence appeared normal, the children lacked nonverbal communication skills, failed to demonstrate empathy with their peers, and were physically clumsy. Asperger called the condition "autistic psychopathy" and described it as primarily marked by [[social isolation]].<ref name=NINDS/> He called his young patients "little professors",<ref name=ha>{{cite book |author= [[Hans Asperger|Asperger H]]; tr. and annot.

People with AS may refer to themselves in casual conversation as ''aspies'', coined by [[Liane Holliday Willey]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite book |author= Willey LH |title= Pretending to be Normal: Living with Asperger's Syndrome |publisher= Jessica Kingsley |year=1999 |isbn=1-85302-749-9}}</ref> The word ''[[neurotypical]]'' (abbreviated ''NT'') describes a person whose neurological development and state are typical, and is often used to refer to non-autistic people.
The [[Internet]] has allowed individuals with AS to communicate and [[Autistic Pride Day|celebrate]] with each other in a way that was not previously possible due to their rarity and geographic dispersal. A [[Autistic community|subculture of aspies]] has formed.

Autistic people have contributed to a shift in perception of autism spectrum disorders as complex [[syndrome]]s rather than diseases that must be cured.

[[Simon Baron-Cohen]] has argued that AS and high-functioning autism are different cognitive styles, not disabilities, and that a diagnosis of AS/HFA should not be received as a family tragedy, but as interesting information, such as learning that a child is left-handed. According to Baron-Cohen, "people with AS/HFA might not necessarily be disabled in an environment in which an exact mind, attracted to detecting small details, is an advantage."<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Dev Psychopathol |year=2000 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=489<U+2013>500 |title= Is Asperger syndrome/high-functioning autism necessarily a disability? |author= Baron-Cohen S |pmid=11014749 |doi=10.1017/S0954579400003126}}</ref> [[Tony Attwood]] argues, "the unusual profile of abilities that we define as Asperger's syndrome has probably been an important and valuable characteristic of our species throughout evolution."<ref>{{cite book |author= [[Tony Attwood|Attwood T]] |year=2006 |title= The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome |publisher= Jessica Kingsley |isbn=1843104954 |pages=p. 12}}</ref>
