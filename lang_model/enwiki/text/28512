On the Chesapeake Bay, Mount Harmon Plantation, in Cecil County MD, is a 200-acre estate and nature preserve on a peninsula by the north shore of the Sassafras River. The plantation was born in 1651 as a land grant from Lord Baltimore to Godfrey Harmon, who had arrived at what is now Wilmington, DE on the Kalmar Nyckle. From 1760 to 1810 Mount Harmon flourished as a tobacco plantation owned by the Louttit and George families. Mount Harmon eventually fell out of family hands and into disrepair. In 1963, Marguerite duPont de Villiers Boden, a direct descendant of the Louttits and Georges, rescued the plantation, restoring the Colonial Kitchen and Manor House. Mrs. Boden filled the house with 18th century antiques, and restored the Tobacco Prize House as a reminder of the plantation<U+2019>s glory days as a tobacco shipping center for the Sassafras River area. After Mrs. Boden<U+2019>s death, her daughter Kip Kelso Boden Crist ensured the plantation<U+2019>s future by forming Friends of Mount Harmon, Inc.  Today, the dedicated FOMH, almost all volunteers, carry out their mission to preserve and interpret the plantation for the education and enjoyment of its visitors. FOMH conducts house and kitchen tours, hosts Colonial picnics, Yuletide tours, and special events, as well as operates educational programs for public and private schools.  FOMH maintains nature trails that wind around the property, affording open views to the tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. Mount Harmon gives water access to canoes, kayaks and boats. The formal boxwood garden is perfect for weddings, and the spacious Manor House grounds are ideal for festive events and corporate meetings. Mount Harmon Plantation is an extraordinary Colonial site for modern education and enjoyment. 

MOUNT HARMON OWNERSHIP TIMELINE
Cecilius Calvert, the second Lord Baltimore was given a charter for a large tract of land north of the Potomac River. King Charles in granting it has named this tract Maryland, in honor of his queen, Hennetta Maria. 

Lord Baltimore now had the title of lord proprietor. He wanted the tract for two reasons: First, he wished to found a state and become its ruler. Second, he wanted to furnish a refuge for the Roman Catholics (his faith) and the Puritans, who were oppressed in England. 	 

Lord Baltimore granted Gotfried Harmer (Godfrey Harmon)350 acres of land adjacent to the Sassafras River. Harmer was a Swede who came to America in 1638 aboard the ship The Kalmar Nyckle. He first settled in the Swedish enclave on the Delaware River, which is now Wilmington, Delaware. Gotfried Harmer was the grandson of Captain Peter Minuit<U+2019>s sister, Sarah Minuit<U+201D> he stated in his letter.  He has been identified as an "original settler." Gotfried Harmer, a boy about 14 years old, was Minuit<U+2019>s grand nephew and served as Huygen<U+2019>s assistant at Fort Cristina. (Note: Hendrick Huygen served as commissary at Fort Christina, with the duty to account for all transactions, from the purchase of pelts from the Indians to the distribution of stores to the colonists.) He (Harmer) was born in Worms in the Rhineland, the son of Hans Willem Harmer, whose father Daniel Harmer married Peter Minuit<U+2019>s elder sister Sarah Minuit. A 1662 affidavit in Amsterdam confirms that Harmer went first to Goteborg in 1637 and then went to the South River in the service of his uncle Peter Minuit and his cousin Hendrick Huygen. In 1640 he returned to Amsterdam on the Kalmar Nyckel. On 12 April 1641, Gotfried Harmer was advanced 16 guilders (two months wages) in Amsterdam on his departure for New Sweden ads Huygen<U+2019>s assistant. Effective 12 Jan 1642, his salary was increased to 10 guilders per month. In the 1644 roll he was listed at Fort Christina as Huygen<U+2019>s servant; in the 1648 roll he was named Huygen<U+2019>s assistant. Through his contacts with the Indians, he became very fluent in their language and witnessed an Indian Deed at Fort Elfsborg on 3 July 1651. When Huygen returned to Sweden in 1653, Harmer chose to remain in America and moved to the Sassafras River in Maryland in order to pursue Indian trading for his own account. From this vantage point, he wrote several letters to New Sweden settlers in 1654, urging that they also desert New Sweden to take advantage of the free land offered by the Maryland government. Maryland granted Harmer a patent for 200 acres, 15 Oct. 1657. On 21 August 1658, two tracts were surveyed for him on the Sassafras River-Mount Harman, 200 acres, and Harman<U+2019>s Mount, 150 acres. But Gotfried Harmer<U+2019>s ambitions soon led him further westward to the Gunpowder River in Baltimore County. On 10 May 1661, Harmer was named Indian interpreter for Captain John Odbur<U+2019>s company of 50 soldiers going to aid the Susquehanna Indians against the invading Seneca Indians. Harmer married Mary Spry, daughter of Oliver and Johanna spry, and died in 1674 at his home on the gunpowder River, survived by his wife and three daughters, Sarah, Elizabeth and Mary.<U+201C>

1659: Harmer sold the property to Cornelius (Neales) and Elinor Urinson. (Urimson/Urianson). We don<U+2019>t know how either family used the property. 

3/13/1675: The Urinsons sold the property to William Ward, who owned the plantation on the next peninsula to the east, Woodlawn.
We have found out nothing of the Urinson family, as Mrs. Boden writes, <U+201C>except that they had at least one daughter, for Elinor names <U+201C>her son,<U+201D> Andrew Poulson, her attorney in their deed of sale of the property to William Ward of the large adjoining estate, <U+201C>Woodlawn,<U+201D> in 1675, after just 16 years of ownership. (Witnessed by Augustine Herman)<U+201D>
Deed. Cornelius Urimson and Ellinor Urimson of Cecil Co., to William Ward of the same place, 50 acres of land, part of a tract called Mt Harmon by the Sassafras River formerly sold to Neales Urimson by  Godfrey Harmer. Made 13 Mar 1675. Wit: John Cosyns,  John Wheeler. Ackn: 22 Mar 1675/6 before Augustin Herman and Henry  Ward by William Galloway and Andrew Powlson, attorneys for Cornelius Urimson and Elinor Urimson.
Power of Attorney. Elinor Urimson appoints her son Andrew Powlson to be her attorney to acknowledge and deliver to William Ward the land she now lives on. Made 23 Mar 1675/6. Wit: Axel Still, John ___. [both p. 5, Abstracts of Cecil County Land Records 1673-1751, by June D Brown]
 
**NOTE: "Neales Urimson" is Cornelius URIANSON, who came to New Sweden as a soldier on the Eagle in 1654. His daughter (name unknown) married Anders Powlson, youngest son of P<U+00E5>l J<U+00F6>nsson Mullica. These two men were also granted Denization in Maryland in 1661. [Maryland Archives Volume 3 (1660-1661), pp 428, 429, 430]

1720: William Ward (First of Woodlawn), died.
20 April 1721 - John Ward, son of William Ward, gave his brother William Ward, carpenter, 50 acres, called Harman's Mount and Indian Range.
 
About 1730, William Ward Jr. built the mansion.

1737: Now comes the tobacco heyday of Mount Harmon. (1740-1805)
James Heath (founder of the town of Warwick, MD) bought the estate
Heath made the estate the center of his tobacco trade. His schooner sailed regularly from his dock and prize house to Great Britain, carrying the tobacco of the Sassafras River plantations. . (The Heaths were rich and powerful Catholics.)

During his ownership through 1760, James Heath expanded the estate to 1,200 acres. Mount Harmon now included the entire peninsula up to Grove Neck Road, where visitors enter through the brick pillars. 

Now we come to the ownership that connects Marguerite du Pont de Villiers Boden to Mount Harmon:
1760: Heath sold the estate to James Louttit, a Scottish merchant from Glasgow. Louitt married Mary George, the daughter of an Irish lawyer, Joshua George, from Annapolis.  
James Louttit of Orkney, after college days in Glasgow, went on a world tour, including Russia, that finally led him to Maryland. He settled at Turner<U+2019>s Creek where many Scottish merchants had settled. The ancient little house still stands on Louttit Point, a high bill over-looking a small inlet on which was the Louttit wharf, his moorage for his schooner, The Bee. Mrs. Boden wrote, <U+201C><U+2026>James Louttit, Sr. from Glasgow, Scotland, and the Orkeny Islands, graduate of Edinburgh, world traveler and merchant of considerable fortune. He is first found settled in America at Louttit<U+2019>s Point on Turner<U+2019>s Creek, Kent County, Maryland on the Sassafras River. The Louttits held pew No. 7 in Old Shrewsbury (Episcopal) Church nearby. Mary George Louttit brought considerable land with her, for in 1760 they sold her part of the <U+201C>Morton Tract<U+201D> left by her father, a very beautiful old house. They then bought Mount Harmon.<U+201D>

The date of James Louttit<U+2019>s arrival in Maryland is uncertain, but in 1755 he held pew no. 7 in Old Shrewsbury Church Nth., Sassafras Parish, Kent County. He married Mary George, daughter of Joshua George, a noted Attorney and Landowner of Cecil Co., formerly of Maryborough, Queen<U+2019>s County, MD. 

In 1760, James Louttit bought Mt. Harmon Plantation, 1,200 acres of beautiful green-forested country almost surrounded by the Sassafras River and its tributary creeks. Here stood the beautiful brick Georgian Mansion. Mrs. Boden felt that James really wanted this lovely home, and <U+2018>James usually got what he wanted.<U+2019> James Louttit<U+2019>s schooner <U+201C>The Bee<U+201D> took tobacco to England and Scotland, and brought back luxuries from the Homeland. The family was rich then, and James, his fami1y wife (Mary George Louttit), James Jr., Sarah, May, Mary, and Joshua moved in a circle of wealth and luxury.  Mary Louttit married into the rich and highly respected George family; Sarah and May into the one founded by the Planter John and Martha Veazey, great landholders, and prolific, <U+2018>really the landed gentry of the County, and of great importance in those times.<U+2019> It was a house of burgesses, many distinguished in both Civil and Military Posts. Some were Vestrymen of St. Stephen<U+2019>s.

Meanwhile, Mary George Louttit<U+2019>s brother Sidney George, Sr.  married Sara Dyer, whose lineage traces back to Boston, Rhode Island and England<U+2019>s Lady Arbella Stuart. 

Mount Harmon stayed in the hands of the Louttits and Georges for three generations. This lineage prompted Mrs. Boden, in the 20th century, to restore and furnish the manor with antiques of the 18th and 19th centuries, in honor of her ancestors, the Louttits. 

1766: James Louttit, Sr. died. His funeral service was conducted by the preacher, the Rev. Wm. Barroll of St. Stephen<U+2019>s Church in Earleville, which the Louttits now attended. The sermon (printed) extolled James as a fine and important man, and to Mrs. Boden, the picture of James is clear: - <U+2018>an energetic, well-liked man, with a good business head<U+2019> and she adds, <U+201C>a pity his sons died early, and with them the Louttit name<U+201D>. 

James Louttit, Jr. died in 1788, leaving the estate to Mary Louttit, who had married her first cousin, Sidney George, Jr., in 1788 as his third wife. Sidney George, Jr.  was heir to the vast George holdings. Now he became Master of Mount Harmon, too.  Sidney George, Jr. brought to this marriage his daughter Ann Eliza, daughter of his second wife Ann Eliza Worrell of Chestertown, MD, whom he had married in 1785. 
Thus James Louttit Jr. was keeping the property in the family in two ways, for at this point the Louttit name would die out. 
This nephew-husband seems to have administered well. He had 60 slaves (the largest holder in Cecil County).  

Sidney George, Jr. applied himself to rebuilding Mount Harmon from its first fire, which had burned the North (or office) Wing (date unknown, but prior to 1788). He made careful drawings of all the woodwork, including paneling and cornices, for his carpenter to follow. His <U+201C>mother-in-law aunt<U+201D> Mary George Louttit (widow of James Louttit) took care to maintain <U+201C>head status<U+201D> on the plantation. Sidney George, Jr. maintained his own race horses and created a private race track on the plantation, horse racing being a fashionable pastime for the local landowners. Mary Louttit and Sidney George, Jr. had a daughter, Phoebe Louttit George.

1806: The glamorous tobacco era of Mount Harmon ended.
Sidney George, Jr. died, and 12-year-old Phoebe Louttit George inherited. The plantation was too much for her mother, the aging Mary George Louttit George to run. In 1810 they retreated to Wilmington DE with their antiques after selling off their horses, arming tools and some furniture. Mary George Louttit George died in 1814.

Phoebe Louttit George became an orphan at 20 and was considered an heiress of substantial means. In 1817, she was engaged to be married to Moses Bradford, seventh in line of descent from Governor Wm. Bradford, of Plymouth, Massachusetts, and the editor of the Wilmington based Delaware Gazette.  They were married on May 17, 1817 and, shortly afterwards, in 1818, removed to <U+201C>Little Bohemia<U+201D> on the Sassafras River in Middleneck, Cecil County, MD, the property Phoebe then owned, a place she often referred to as <U+201C>Oldfields.<U+201D> This was the ancient George property upon which was a substantial brick house with interior paneling, now unfortunately destroyed by someone in later years.
At Bradford<U+2019>s urging, just 20 days before their marriage, Phoebe Louttit George traded Mount Harmon Plantation to her half-sister, the widow and gentlewoman of Philadelphia Ann Eliza George Fisher (wife of James Logan Fisher, who died in 1814) in exchange for the Little Bohemia (<U+201C>Oldfields<U+201D>), above the Bohemia River. The excuse for the exchange was that Little Bohemia was less of a commute for Moses to Wilmington. The George family was furious with Phoebe Louttit George for allowing Mount Harmon to fall under the control of the Fisher family.

Here is the Louttit genealogy that connects Mrs. Boden to Mount Harmon.
Phoebe Louttit George Bradford and Moses Bradford had a son, Hon. Edward Green Bradford (Judge U.S. Circuit court) who married Elizabeth Roberts Canby.
Their daughter Elizabeth Canby Bradford married Alexis Irenee duPont as his second wife.
They had a daughter, Alice Eugenie du Pont, who married Julien de Villiers Ortiz.
They had a daughter, Marguerite du Pont de Villiers who married as her second husband Harry Clark Boden IV. 

1821-1834: Ann Eliza George Fisher (who received Mount Harmon in trade from her half-sister Phoebe Louttit George Bradford) died suddenly  in 1834 at age 48, leaving her three minor children under the guardianship of their father<U+2019>s brother, Uncle William Logan Fisher, a Quaker who lived in Philadelphia. Guardian Fisher held Mount Harmon in trust for Charles Henry Fisher, James Logan Fisher, and Sidney George Fisher.

At one point (we are not sure when) a relative of the George family, Dr. John Thompson Veazey, moved onto the plantation with the intention of buying it.  We do know that Dr. Veazey and family were in residence for eight years, because records show that his son George Ross Veazey was born in 1820 at Mount Harmon, then described as being at Sassafras Neck. Unfortunately, Dr. Veazey was seldom paid for his services in money and was unable to meet the payments demanded by Uncle William Logan Fisher. After eight years of tenancy, Dr. Veazey was evicted from the property. This ruptured all relationships between Phoebe and the George family, who ceased to communicate with her (in effect, shunning her).
(Dr. John Thompson Veazey, son of Dr. Thomas Brocas and Mary Thompson Veazey, 7/22/1783-3/30/1839. Married 1815 to Sarah (1789-1866), daughter of William and Ann Veazey Ward, of Woodlawn, Sassafras Neck. ) He lived as a planter and physician on Sassafras Neck , and like each of his ancestors in turn, was vestryman at St. Stephen<U+2019>s Episcopal Church in Earleville, MD. They had five children. 

For the next nine years the buildings stood vacant, and the property regressed to nature, becoming overgrown. Apparently the guardian William Logan Fisher attempted no upkeep, farming or tenancy.  

1834: Upon the death of James Logan Fisher, the youngest of the three brothers, Uncle William distributed their mother<U+2019>s legacy, (Ann Eliza Worrell George Fisher). Uncle William Fisher divided their mother's property giving  Charles Henry Fisher "Painter's Rest" and "Pullen's Refuge" while Sidney George Fisher had "Mt. Harmon" with the house and dependencies and the "Quarter Farm" which is what they called "Sheffield." Thus, the eldest brother, Sidney George Fisher became the sole owner of Mount Harmon Plantation in 1834.  We know most about the operation of the plantation from 1837-1850 because of the diaries that Sidney George Fisher kept for those years. 

1834-1871 Sidney George Fisher owned the plantation, although he stopped operating it in 1850. 

The most we know of Mount Harmon Plantation comes from Sidney George Fisher<U+2019>s diaries.
The 80 years of tobacco cultivation may have depleted the soil of nutrients needed to produce abundant crops. Sidney George Fisher seems to have understood the need to fertilize the ground, for in the first entry of his diary in 1837 he bemoans the mean treatment the land received by previous owners and the <U+201C>wonderful effect<U+201D> that treating the land with lime and plaster have had upon his current crops of <U+201C>oats, corn and grass.<U+201D>

Sidney George Fisher<U+2019>s mother (Ann Eliza George Fisher) had freed all the Mount Harmon slaves. He was dependent on hired overseers or tenant farmers to care for his plantation. His stays here were not protracted and he constantly lamented at having to return to crowded, noisy, crime ridden Philadelphia. 

As much as he loved Mount Harmon, he seldom visited in the summer fearing that he would contract malaria and bilious fever, which were prevalent in the area during July, August and September. He offered this as the reason not to make Mount Harmon Plantation his permanent home. 

In 1851, Sidney George Fisher married Elizabeth Ingersoll of Philadelphia. She found Mount Harmon too far from Philadelphia and her friends. Her family gave them a large house on several acres in Germantown (a suburb of Philadelphia annexed in to the city in 1854) that apparently was bucolic enough to satisfy Sidney<U+2019>s desire to escape the city. He spent less and less time here at Mount Harmon, a day or two at the most, and made no further diary entries. 

1864: Sidney George Fisher received news that a second fire at Mount Harmon had spread from the outside kitchen to the south wing. This was his greatest blow, for he had spent considerable money and enthusiasm early on, after 1834, when he had taken over.  This time he made cheap repairs to the manor house. 

He lived until 1871, depending heavily on the income Mount Harmon provided him, meager as it was. Unfortunately, his absenteeism and preference for the good life led to the slow deterioration of the plantation. There were just a few good years under his ownership that the plantation showed a profit. When Sidney George Fisher died at age 62, he was heavily in debt. 

Of Sidney George Fisher, Mrs. Boden writes: <U+201C>That he would not work himself he always recognized, but simply accepted as his mode of life. The <U+2018>farm<U+2019> produces less and less, he scarcely sees it any more and his health is failing.<U+201D> <U+201C>The fortunes of Mt. Harmon had gone down. There remained only the beautiful descriptions he penned, and the fine, now stately, trees he planted as well as the avenue of Osage oranges.<U+201D>  

1871-1927: Sydney George Fisher inherited Mount Harmon Plantation. He had changed the spelling of his first name to distinguish himself from his father.  He was a bachelor, a scholar and a writer on the American Revolution. 

1888: <U+201C>Lightening flashed and thunder boomed as a destructive whirlwind uprooted trees, toppled chimneys, and shook buildings on the fateful day of August 21, 1888. Above the wild roar, a summer storm hopscotched its way across the top of the Eastern Sore. The splintering of buildings and the crashing of falling timbers could occasionally be heard.
Blowing across the Sassafras River, it first struck Cecil County at Mount Harmon plantation. The mansion<U+2019>s roof flew into pieces, a carriage house splintered and an attractive grove of trees, nearly every one of them toppled over, reported the Every Evening of Wilmington, Delaware.<U+201D> Excerpt from Michael Dixon<U+2019>s article in the Cecil Whig, date unknown.  
During the slow decline of the 19th century, many of the fields reverted to woodlands in a process referred to as <U+201C>old field succession<U+201D> by ecologists. 

Mrs. Boden wrote: <U+201C>In 1913 a third fire occurs at Mount Harmon.<U+201D> 

1927: The plantation was sold out of the family, bought by a member of the Philadelphia bar, a judge, and a former family friend, named Shaffer. He and his wife used it as a weekend retreat, but as they grew older, distance made this inconvenient. We learned from Audrey Boulden Polzer that her mother, Rachel Craig Boulden, worked for the Shaffers in the 1930s.  

1937: The Shaffers sold Mount Harmon Plantation to the Blakslee family from Pottsville PA, who knew nothing at all of its history. The Blakslees brought with them their 14-year old fraternal twins and their governess Mary. They hired a young man named Nelson Taylor to farm for them. One day, according to Mary, Mr. Blakslee said, <U+201C>Mary, I<U+2019>d like you to meet Nelson. He<U+2019>s cute. I think you<U+2019>ll like him.<U+201D> She did, and they married.  When the Blakslees left Mount Harmon Plantation, Mary and Nelson moved to Earleville. Mrs. Boden met and liked Mary, who then became Mrs. Boden<U+2019>s housekeeper. 
1939: The Blakeslees built an addition to the Manor House. (Mrs. Boden wrote, <U+201C>For some reason they added a wing to the south side. Unfortunately this was not of the architectural proportion is should have been, or was, when the original house was a five bay brick mansion similar to Tulip Hill or Kennersley, in the time of James Louttit, Sr. This wing, being built in 1939, was done with the best materials and heating, and proved very useful as a place to live during Mrs. Boden<U+2019>s restoration, which started in 1963.<U+201D>

1945: Orlin Anderson, Sr. and his wife Irene moved from Ohio and purchased Mount Harmon.  They farmed the property but did little to keep up the manor house. During this time, they allowed loggers to remove all the best trees on the wooded acres. During their tenure they knew Mrs. Boden was very interested in the property.  When farming was no longer profitable for them, they sold Mount Harmon to Mrs. Boden.

1963:  Mrs. Boden rescued Mount Harmon. A woman of impeccable taste and great resources, she began personal campaign to reverse the abuses done to the mansion and out buildings. She was able to restore the prize house and the colonial out kitchen as well as upgrade the cottages, which you passed on the way in, for the use of the maintenance staff. (The cow barns, silos and chicken coops were removed.) Coming down the drive, on the left you will see an ancient tomb and a dry well, also restored by Mrs. Boden.  The following is written on the back of a 1965 photo, <U+201C>Ancient tomb, restored, older than the first one at Mt. Vernon. The well and well-house are a replacement of an old one.<U+201D> This magnificent restoration took 12 years. 

1974: Mrs. Boden donated Mount Harmon along with a substantial endowment to the National Trust for Historic Preservation.  James Biddle, president of National Trust for Historic Preservation in the United States delivered the dedication address. In attendance were Frederick Houpt III, director of public affairs for the National Trust; The Rt. Rev. Arthur R. McKinstry, retired Episcopal Bishop of Delaware, who gave the invocation. Mrs. Boden gave the plantation in memory of James Louttit Sr. and his wife Mary George. The plantation was given preservation status through continuing residential use. In his address, Biddle said, <U+201C>The acquisition of Mount Harmon points an entirely new direction for the trust. Almost all of the historic properties which the trust administers across our country are maintained as house museums. Our treatment of Mount Harmon plantation represents a new concept for us <U+2013> the National Trust Historic House.<U+201D> 

In addition to restoring Mount Harmon to its former grandeur, Mrs. Boden further preserved the memory of the Louttits. She restored James Sr.<U+2019>s early home on Turner<U+2019>s Creek and both Louttit churches, Old Shrewsbury and St. Stephen<U+2019>s, to their pre-revolutionary state, putting memorial windows in both. When Washington College was established in 1782-3, James Jr. had subscribed to certain Scholarships. Mrs. Boden maintained them  
On the 200th anniversary of St. Stephen<U+2019>s Church, the Preacher was her guest, His Grace, the Rt. Rev. Henry Irving Louttit, Bishop of South Florida, of the Buffalo Branch of the Louttit family. 


1977: Mrs. Boden died. 

1984: The Natural Lands Trust assumed ownership and management of the plantation. 

1992: Mount Harmon was closed. 

1997:  Mrs. Boden's daughter Kip Kelso Boden Crist (Mrs. William Leland Crist) formed The Friends of Mount Harmon, Inc. to ensure the plantation<U+2019>s future.  She died on November 28, 2001.

Present: Today, the dedicated FOMH, almost all volunteers, carry out their mission to preserve and interpret the plantation for the education and enjoyment of its visitors.
