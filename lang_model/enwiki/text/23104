"'''Homer's Barbershop Quartet'''" is the first episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''{{'}} [[The Simpsons (season 5)|fifth season]]. The episode was written by [[Jeff Martin (writer)|Jeff Martin]] and directed by [[Mark Kirkland]]. It features The Be Sharps, a [[barbershop quartet]] founded by [[Homer Simpson]]. The band's story roughly parallels that of [[The Beatles]]. [[George Harrison]] and [[David Crosby]] guest star as themselves, and [[The Dapper Dans]] provide the singing voices of The Be Sharps.

The episode begins with the Simpson family as they attend a swap meet. There, [[Bart Simpson]] and his sister [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] notice a picture of their father, Homer, on the cover of an old [[LP album]]. Homer explains to his family that he, [[Principal Skinner]], [[Barney Gumble]], and [[Apu]] recorded a barbershop quartet album in 1985, which catapulted them to national fame. He narrates to his family the story of how the band formed, reached the pinnacle of success, and eventually folded. At the end of the episode, the group reunites to perform a concert on the roof of [[Moe's Tavern]], singing their number-one hit "Baby on Board".

Throughout the episode, several references are made to The Beatles and other popular culture icons. In its original American broadcast, "Homer's Barbershop Quartet" finished 30th in ratings, with a [[Nielsen Rating]] of 12.7. It was praised for its The Beatles cameo, despite being a leftover episode from the previous season. Reviews that criticized the episode's inconsistent humor blamed it on the change of writers before the episode's creation.

==Plot==
At the [[Springfield (the Simpsons)|Springfield]] Swap Meet, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson]] notice the face of their father, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], on the cover of an [[LP album]]. Homer explains that he, [[Principal Skinner]], [[Barney Gumble|Barney]], and [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]] recorded a [[barbershop quartet]] album in 1985, which catapulted them to national fame. He then tells his family the story of how the album came to be. While performing at [[Moe's Tavern]], an agent offered to represent the group as a band, but only on the condition that they expelled [[Chief Wiggum]], who was the band's fourth member at the time. After an audition during when the band rejected candidates to fill Wiggum's position, the trio returned downheartedly to Moe's Tavern, where they recruited Barney after hearing him sing in a beautiful [[Ireland|Irish]] tenor voice. The four members then brainstormed on a name for the group, eventually settling on The Be Sharps.<ref name=episode>{{cite episode |title=Homer's Barbershop Quartet |series=The Simpsons |airdate=1993-09-30 }}</ref>

In the present, Homer brags that he sold his car's [[spare tire]] at the swap meet. On the way home, one of their tires blows out. While Marge walks to a gas station to get a new tire, Homer continues his story. He tells Bart and Lisa that after Marge bought a [[Baby On Board]] sign, Homer wrote a song inspired by the fad. The song "Baby on Board" appeared on the group's first album, ''Meet The Be Sharps'', and the song became a hit. The Be Sharps performed the song at the [[Statue of Liberty]]'s [[centennial]] in 1986, and they later won a [[Grammy]] for Outstanding Soul, Spoken Word, or Barbershop Album of the Year for ''Meet The Be Sharps''.<ref name=episode />

Back in the present, the Simpsons are at home, where Homer explains that The Be Sharps became so popular that they were featured on merchandise, including lunch boxes, mugs, and posters. The band later released their second album, ''[[Bigger than Jesus]]''. While The Be Sharps grew in fame, creative disputes arose when Barney dated a Japanese [[conceptual art]]ist, which eventually led to his leaving the group. Barney and his girlfriend recorded a song in which his girlfriend repeatedly says "Number 8" over [[tape loop]]s of Barney's [[belch]]es. Ultimately, the group realized they were no longer popular. The latest issue of ''[[Us Weekly]]''{{'}}s What's Hot and What's Not confirmed this, noting that the band was no longer "hot". The band then split up; Principal Skinner returned to the [[Springfield Elementary School]], Apu to the [[Kwik-E-Mart]], and Homer to the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]]. Returning to present day, the group reunites to perform a concert on the roof of Moe's Tavern, singing their number one hit "Baby on Board". Pedestrians stop and listen to them singing their comeback concert, including [[George Harrison]] of [[The Beatles]], who remarks, "It's been done."<ref name=episode />

==Production==
[[File:Jeff Martin.jpg|thumb|left|Jeff Martin, a fan of The Beatles, wrote the episode.]]

One of the writers for ''The Simpsons'' suggested that they should create an episode that focuses on Homer in a [[barbershop quartet]] and "a big parody of The Beatles". The episode was written by [[Jeff Martin (writer)|Jeff Martin]], who was an "obsessive" Beatles fan, making him "a natural to write [the episode]".<ref name="Martin">{{cite video | people=Martin, Jeff|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Barbershop Quartet"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>  [[Mark Kirkland]], a "huge" Beatles fan, directed the episode, and ensured that The Beatles references were accurate. Kirkland enjoyed directing the episode because unlike other episodes he directed, he did not experience any trouble animating "Homer's Barbershop Quartet". The animators liked creating The Beatles gags and enjoyed the barbershop music. After the animators synchronized the audio track, music, and animation, they "just fell in love" with it. They also enjoyed working on the [[choreography]] of The Be Sharps and trying to match the characters' movements with the music. They were inspired by The Beatles film ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]'', including the shots of the band in the recording studio where they decide to break up. Kirkland did not think there was anything "spectacular" in the episode's animation, but he and his animation team "just loved" working on it.<ref name="Kirkland">{{cite video | people=Kirkland, Mark|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Barbershop Quartet"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

[[File:BarbershopQuartet Disneyworld.jpg|thumb|200px|The Dapper Dans, a barbershop quartet, provided the singing voices of The Be Sharps in the episode.]]

In a scene in the episode, Lisa sees a man selling an original Malibu Stacy doll from 1958 that has big, pointed breasts. The man, nicknamed "Wiseguy" by the show's staff, tells Lisa that "they took [the doll] off the market after some kid put both his eyes out." The joke received a censor note from the Fox network's censors because they did not want such jokes on the show, but the producers ignored the note and the joke appeared in the episode when it aired.<ref name="Groening">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Barbershop Quartet"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>  The Be Sharps's singing voices were provided by the four members of [[The Dapper Dans]], a barbershop quartet that performs at [[Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[California]]. Before working on the episode, Martin had seen one of the quartet's performances and enjoyed it. When the episode's production began, he contacted the quartet, and they agreed to make a guest appearance in the episode. The Dapper Dans's singing was intermixed with the normal voice actor's voices, often with a regular voice actor singing the melody and The Dapper Dans providing backup.<ref name="Martin"/>

[[George Harrison]] guest stars in the episode as himself. He was the second Beatles member after [[Ringo Starr]] to appear on ''The Simpsons''. When Harrison arrived at the recording studio in [[West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California|West Los Angeles]] to record his lines, the casting director told the episode's [[show runner]]s, [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]], that Harrison was coming and that they were not allowed to tell anybody about it because it was intended to be a secret to the staff. Jean, Reiss, and the show's creator [[Matt Groening]] went to see Harrison in the studio, and when they returned to the writer's room, Groening said, "Guess who I just met? George Harrison!", not knowing that it was supposed to be a secret.<ref name="Jean"/> Harrison arrived at the studio by himself without any entourage or bodyguards. Groening recalls that Harrison was "pretty glum", and he was unenthusiastic when the staff asked him questions about The Beatles. However, when Groening asked Harrison about the ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'' album, he suddenly "perked up" because it was one of his solo albums that he was rarely questioned on. Harrison's guest appearance was one of Groening's favorites because he was "super nice" and "very sweet" to the staff.<ref name="Groening"/> Jean said it was a "huge thrill" to have him appear.<ref name="Jean"/> [[David Crosby]] also makes a guest appearance in the episode as himself, and appears in the scene in which he presents a Grammy award to The Be Sharps.<ref name="Azaria"/>

"Homer's Barbershop Quartet" was a hold-over episode from the season four production line. It was chosen to air as the fifth season's premiere episode because it guest starred Harrison. The Fox network executives wanted to premiere with [[Conan O'Brien]]'s episode "[[Homer Goes to College]]" because of its parody of the 1978 comedy film ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', but the writers felt "Homer's Barbershop Quartet" would be a better choice because of Harrison's involvement.<ref name="Jean">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Barbershop Quartet"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>  The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 30, 1993.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-02-03 |url=http://tv.ign.com/objects/823/823910.html |title=Homer's Barbershop Quartet   |publisher=IGN }}</ref> It was included in a 2002 video collection of selected musical-themed episodes titled ''[[The Simpsons DVDs#The Simpsons Backstage Pass|The Simpsons: Backstage Pass]]''.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-02-03 |url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=4919 |title=The Simpsons: Backstage Pass |publisher=DVD Times |date=2001-04-12 |author=Foster, Dave }}</ref> The episode was also included in ''The Simpsons'' season five DVD set, which was released on December 21, 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Simpsons-Complete-5th-Season/4113|title=The Simpsons - The Complete 5th Season|publisher=[[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]|accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref>

==Cultural references==
The episode makes several references to [[The Beatles]]. [[Moe's Tavern]] changes its name to Moe's Cavern, a reference to the [[Cavern Club]] in [[Liverpool]] where The Beatles frequently performed in the late 1950s and early 1960s.<ref name="BBC"/> At the end of the episode, the album's back cover is revealed, on which Homer is seen turned away from the camera, as opposed to the rest of the band. This is a parody of the ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' LP reverse, in which [[Paul McCartney]] is in the same position.<ref name="Jean"/> [[Chief Wiggum]], thrown out of the band because he was "too [[Village People]]",<ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|isbn=0-00-638898-1|page=120}}</ref> mirrors [[Pete Best]]. Best was an early member of The Beatles but was replaced by [[Ringo Starr]].<ref name="Jean"/> The cover of ''Bigger Than Jesus'', The Be Sharps' second album, features the group walking on water, which is a direct parody of the art on The Beatles' album ''[[Abbey Road (album)|Abbey Road]]''. The name is a reference to a controversial quote made by John Lennon in 1966. Bart references this by asking, "What did you do [to lose your popularity]? Screw up like The Beatles and say you were bigger than Jesus?", to which Homer replies "All the time, that was the name of our second album."<ref name="book"/> Barney's Japanese conceptual artist girlfriend is a parody of [[Yoko Ono]].<ref name="BBC"/> The group performing atop Moe's Bar at the end of the episode is a parody of The Beatles' impromptu concert on the [[Apple Corps]] rooftop during their [[Let It Be (album)#The "Get Back" sessions|''Get Back'' recording sessions]] in 1969, hence George Harrison's line, "It's been done."<ref name="BBC"/> In addition, The Be Sharps are wearing the same outfits as The Beatles during the rooftop concert scene: Barney in a brown fur coat (John), Homer in a bright red coat (Ringo), Skinner in a black suit (Paul), and Apu in a black coat with green pants (George).<ref name="Kirkland"/> Homer's comment, "I'd like to thank you on behalf of the group and I hope we passed the audition," is the last piece of dialogue, said by John Lennon, on The Beatles ''Let It Be'' album, taken from the Apple rooftop concert.<ref name="BBC"/>

At the swap meet, Homer browses through a box with items that cost five cents each. These include the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], a copy of [[Action Comics 1|Action Comics #1]], a complete block of [[Inverted Jenny]] misprint postal stamps, and a [[Stradivarius]] violin.<ref name="book"/> Principal Skinner tries on a prison mask with the number 24601, notable as [[Jean Valjean]]'s prison number in ''[[Les Mis<U+00E9>rables]]''.<ref name="Martin"/> Homer buys Grampa a pink [[Cadillac]], just as [[Elvis Presley]] did for his mother.<ref name="BBC"/> One of the late night television shows Chief Wiggum watches is [[Johnny Carson]] doing his [[Carnac the Magnificent]] routine.<ref name="Azaria">{{cite video | people=Azaria, Hank|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Barbershop Quartet"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Homer mentions that 1985 was the year that [[Joe Piscopo]] left the NBC sketch show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref name="book"/> Moe sells oyster shells at the swap meet that resemble [[Lucille Ball]].<ref name="Martin"/> Homer begins telling the story of The Be Sharps by saying, "Rock and roll had become stagnant. '[[Achy Breaky Heart]]' was seven years away; something had to fill the void. That something was barbershop."<ref name="book"/> At the [[Grammy]] ceremony, [[Spinal Tap]] and [[MC Hammer]] are in the audience.<ref name="BBC"/> While Bart and Lisa browse through [[LP album]]s at the swap meet, they find "[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]", a song sung by Melvin and the Squirrels, a band that spoofs ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks]]''.<ref name="BBC"/>
