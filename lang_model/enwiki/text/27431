'''Ch<U+00E2>teau Filhot''', archaically named '''Maison Noble de Verdoulet''', is a winery rated ''Deuxi<U+00E8>me cru class<U+00E9>'' (French, <U+201C>Second Growth<U+201D>) in the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]], from the [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]] [[Appellation d'origine contr<U+00F4>l<U+00E9>e|appellation]] in [[Gironde]]. Considered by some unjustly omitted from the ''[[Premier cru]]'' classification, Filhot produces a drier wine than [[Ch<U+00E2>teau d'Yquem]], with an unusually high alcohol content for a Sauternes.<ref name=ALE>{{cite book| last =Lichine  | first =Alexis | title =Alexis Lichine's Encyclopedia of Wines and Spirits  | publisher =Cassell & Company Ltd.  | date =1967  | location =London  | pages =pp.254-255 }}</ref><ref name=BDP>{{cite book|last =Peppercorn |first =David |title =Bordeaux |publisher = Mitchell Beazley |date =2003 |location =London|pages =p.586-587 }}</ref> 

==History==
The vineyard dating from the 1630s, the ch<U+00E2>teau was founded by Romain de Filhot in 1709. Following the [[French revolution]], the estate was taken over by 
Romain-Bertrand de Lur-Saluces who added the estate of Pinaud du Rey and had the ch<U+00E2>teau redesigned to its English appearance in 1840.<ref name=ALE/> During the period when then American ambassador to France [[Thomas Jefferson]] ranked the wine directly behind Yquem, Filhot enjoyed a greater reputation than today, and the two wines were comparably priced.<ref name=wd-cf/>

In 1935, Comtesse Durieu de Lacarelle (the sister of the Marquis de Lur-Saluces, proprietor of Ch<U+00E2>teau d'Yquem) bought the estate, which was subsequently modernised by her son, Louis Durieu de Lacarelle, during the 1970s. The estate is currently run by the Vaucelles family.<ref name=wd-cf/>

==Production==
The vineyard area extends {{convert|62|ha|acre}} from a 350 hectares estate with the [[grape varieties]] of 60% [[S<U+00E9>millon]], 36% [[Sauvignon blanc]] and 4% [[Muscadelle]]. While producing no [[second wine]], the annual production is an average of 6500 cases.<ref name=wd-cf>{{Cite web|last= Kissack |first= Chris, thewinedoctor.com|title=Chateau Filhot |url= http://www.thewinedoctor.com/bordeaux/filhot.shtml }}</ref>
