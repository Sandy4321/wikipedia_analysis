'''Scott David Zolak''' (born December 13, 1967 in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]) is a former [[American football]] [[quarterback]] who played in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for nine seasons. During this time, he played for the [[New England Patriots]] and [[Miami Dolphins]]. Over the course of his career, he played in 55 games, completed 124 of 248 passes for 1,314 yards, threw eight touchdowns and seven interceptions, and finished his career with a passer rating of 64.8.

A graduate of [[Ringgold High School (Pennsylvania)|Ringgold High School]] and the [[University of Maryland]], Zolak was selected 84th in the [[1991 NFL Draft]] by the [[New England Patriots]]. He did not play in 1991, but started a few games in 1992 and had his most productive season statistically. When [[Drew Bledsoe]] was drafted in 1993, Zolak became his backup for the next six seasons. He saw playing time when Bledsoe was hurt, but only started three games during this time. He was released at the end of the 1998 season, and signed with the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins in 1999, playing in one game for Miami before retiring.

==Early life==
===High school===
Zolak was born on December 13, 1967 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As a child, he acted as the [[waterboy]] for the football team at [[Ringgold High School (Pennsylvania)|Ringghold High School]] in [[Monongahela, Pennsylvania]], where his father, Paul, worked as head coach and [[athletic director]].<ref name=montana/><ref name=patriots>{{cite web|url=http://www.patriots.com/alumni/index.cfm?ac=alumnibiosdetail&bio=857|title=Scott Zolak - Official New England Patriots Biography|publisher=Patriots.com|accessdate=2009-05-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Gerald|last=Eskenazi|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/21/sports/football-zolak-the-unfathomable-to-lead-pats-against-jets.html|title=Football; Zolak the Unfathomable To Lead Pats Against Jets|date=November 21, 1992|accessdate=2009-05-24}}</ref>  Future NFL quarterback [[Joe Montana]] played for Ringgold during this time and gave Zolak a football, which he later rubbed for good luck before every game.<ref name=montana>{{cite news|title=Chalk Talk|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|page=6D|date=November 15, 1992}}</ref> When Zolak attended Ringgold High School himself, he was the team's [[starting lineup|starting]] quarterback and [[punter (American football)|punter]], and [[letterman|lettered]] four times.<ref name=patriots/> Zolak also played on the Ringgold basketball team as a [[forward (basketball)|forward]], and was a four-time letterman in that sport as well.<ref name=patriots/> As a result of his football performance, he was invited to participate in the [[Big 33 Football Classic]], which featured the top high school football players in Pennsylvania.<ref>{{cite news|title=Harris, Owens: Big 33's potent pair|first=Mike|last=White|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=August 4, 1986|page=14}}</ref>

===College===
After graduating from high school, Zolak played [[college football]] at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]. He [[redshirt (college sports)|redshirted]] his freshmen year, and became the third-string quarterback behind Dan Henning and [[Neil O'Donnell]] after two quarterbacks transferred.<ref>{{cite news|first=Sally|last=Jenkins|title=Maryland's Komlo to Transfer; Backup Quarterback Wants More Playing Time|work=[[The Washington Post]]|page=e1|date=February 10, 1987}}</ref> By the end of his sophomore season, Zolak was looking to challenge O'Donnell for the starting job, as Henning was graduating.<ref>{{cite news|first=Dave|last=Sell|title=Maryland Starts Practicing|work=The Washington Post|page=f9|date=March 23, 1988}}</ref> As his junior year began, in the summer of 1988, offensive coordinator [[Bob Valesente]] said that Zolak "made tremendous strides and showed a lot to our whole staff," though O'Donnell was to be the starting quarterback that year.<ref>{{cite news|first=Dave|last=Sell|title=O'Donnell Wants Fun From Start; He and Terrapins Seek Early Success|work=The Washington Post|date=August 12, 1988|page=f3}}</ref> Zolak's first collegiate appearance came against [[1988 West Virginia Mountaineers football team|West Virginia]]. He [[completion (American football)|completed]] four of six [[forward pass|passes]] for 28 yards, but had an [[interception (American football)|interception]] returned for a [[touchdown]] by [[Bo Orlando]] in a 55&ndash;24 loss.<ref>{{cite news|first=Dave|last=Sell|title=Miami Rallies, 31-30; Terrapins Routed; Mountaineers Pull Away in 2nd Half, 55-24|work=The Washington Post|date=September 18, 1988|page=d1}}</ref> He appeared in four games for Maryland that season.<ref name=patriots/>

Zolak was again the backup behind O'Donnell in 1989. He played in eight games, completing 33 of 69 passes for 407 yards and two touchdowns.<ref name=patriots/> In 1990, after O'Donnell graduated and began his NFL career, Zolak became the [[List of Maryland Terrapins quarterbacks|starter for Maryland]]. Head coach [[Joe Krivak]] had high hopes for him, saying, "If there's a guy that I would love to see succeed it's someone like Scott Zolak."<ref>{{cite news|first=Anthony|last=Cotton|title=Terrapins Have Two Players Fail to Make Grade; Offensive Starter Falls Just Short|work=The Washington Post|date=August 29, 1990}}</ref> In his first start as a senior, Zolak completed a school record 28 passes in 46 attempts for 303 yards and two touchdowns, including a 51-yard pass to Gene Thomas with 61 seconds left that gave Maryland the win against {{cfb link|year=1990|team=Virginia Tech Hokies|title=Virginia Tech}}, 20&ndash;13.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tech Victory Just Out Of Reach Terps Win Opener 20-13 On Late TD|work=[[The Roanoke Times]]|page=C1|date=September 2, 1990}}</ref> He again offered last minute heroics the following week, throwing a 59-yard touchdown pass to Gene Thomas with 2:27 left to beat 25th ranked {{cfb link|year=1990|team=West Virginia Mountaineers|title=West Virginia}}, 14&ndash;10.<ref>{{cite news|title=Maryland Rallies, Stuns West Virginia|work=[[The Charlotte Observer]]|page=10D|date=September 9, 1990}}</ref> However, he was struggling in other areas. In an October game against [[1990 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech]], Zolak was [[quarterback sack|sacked]] 11 times. In four games, he had been sacked 23 times and thrown 12 interceptions.<ref>{{cite news|title=Georgia Tech Has 11 Sacks, Bags Maryland, 31-3|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=10|date=October 7, 1990}}</ref> By the end of the season, as Maryland was preparing to face {{cfb link|year=1990|team=Louisiana Tech Bulldogs|title=Louisiana Tech}} in the {{alternate links|1990 Independence Bowl|Independence Bowl|title=1990 Independence Bowl}}, he had thrown 225 completed passes in 418 attempts for 2,589 yards and 10 touchdowns, accounting for 73% of Maryland's offense.<ref>{{cite news|title=Maryland's Defense Will Get Tested|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 15, 1990|page=18}}</ref> The teams tied, 34&ndash;34, in Zolak's final collegiate appearance. In his college career, at the time of his graduation, Zolak ranked fifth in school history in pass completions with 270, seventh in yards with 3,124 yards, ranked second in school history with 2,589 yards passing in a season, and was named [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] Offensive Player of the Week four times.<ref name=patriots/>

==Professional career==
===New England Patriots===
With the 84th pick in the fourth round of the [[1991 NFL Draft]], Zolak was selected by the [[New England Patriots]]. His drafting led to a shakeup in the Patriots' quarterback situation when [[Marc Wilson (American football)|Marc Wilson]] announced his retirement and longtime starting quarterback [[Steve Grogan]] was released.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ex-Patriot Grogan seeks backup role|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=April 30, 1991|page=6c}}</ref> Zolak reached an agreement with the Patriots on a contract in July, and was the second-to-last person to hold out after [[Leonard Russell]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Ron|last=Borges|title=Russell Is Last Rookie Holdout|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=July 19, 1991}}</ref> Zolak spent the [[1991 New England Patriots season|1991 season]] as the third-string quarterback, behind [[Hugh Millen]] and [[Tom Hodson]], and did not take the field.<ref name=patriots/>

The start of the [[1992 New England Patriots season|1992 season]] appeared the same, with Zolak being behind Hodson and Millen on the [[depth chart]]. Millen started the first seven games before being injured, and then Hodson became the starter. In early November, Zolak made his professional debut in the fourth quarter against the [[New Orleans Saints]]. Relieving for Hodson, he completed five of nine passes and threw an interception as the Patriots lost, 31&ndash;14.<ref>{{cite news|first=Terry|last=Price|title=Zolak likely to get the ball Patriots will take a look at third-string quarterback Zolak set to start|work=[[The Hartford Courant]]|page=E1|date=November 10, 1992}}</ref> The next week, Zolak made his first career start when the still winless Patriots faced the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. He completed 20 of 29 passes for 261 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in the Patriots' first win of the season, 37&ndash;34.<ref>{{cite news|title=Spotlight / A Glance At This Week In The NFL Not Super|work=Los Angeles Times|page=4|date=November 16, 1992}}</ref> As a result of his performance, he was named the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) Player of the Week.<ref name=week/> The next week, Zolak led his team to their second victory of the season against the [[New York Jets]]. He completed seven of 16 passes for 102 yards, getting help from [[Jon Vaughn]] who rushed for 110 yards, and the Patriots won, 24&ndash;3.<ref>{{cite news|first=Barbara|last=Barker|title=Instant Replay|work=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]|date=November 23, 1992}}</ref> However, the following week's performance against the [[Atlanta Falcons]] was less impressive. He completed nine of 16 passes for 58 yards and two interceptions in the Patriots' losing effort, and he said it felt like he was "on a desert island by myself."<ref>{{cite news|first=Terry|last=Price|title=Zolak's confidence unshaken|work=The Hartford Courant|page=D5|date=November 30, 1992}}</ref> After the performance against Atlanta, Zolak lost the starting job, and Millen again filled that role. However, Millen suffered a shoulder injury against the Colts, and after Zolak played part of the game against Indianapolis, he again became the starter for the game against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Joe|last=Cunningham|title=Surprising Chargers Next Test For Klingler|work=[[Dayton Daily News]]|page=11D|date=December 13, 1992}}</ref> Zolak injured his ankle at the end of the third quarter, making the appearance against Kansas City his last for the season as [[Jeff Carlson]] took over quarterbacking duties.<ref>{{cite news|first=Dan|last=Caesar|title=Farewell Finale|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|page=3C|date=December 14, 1992}}</ref> Zolak finished the season with 52 pass completions in 100 attempts, 561 yards, two touchdowns, four interceptions, and a quarterback rating of 58.8.<ref name=pfr>{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/Z/ZolaSc00.htm|title=Scott Zolak Statistics|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=2009-05-29}}</ref> 

In 1993, the Patriots and new head coach [[Bill Parcells]] were looking to improve the quarterback spot on their roster. They signed [[Scott Secules]], and attempted to sign [[Steve Beuerlein]], but the latter deal did not happen. They also gave Hugh Millen permission to seek a trade.<ref>{{cite news|first=Terry|last=Price|title=Patriots give up on Millen|work=The Hartford Courant|page=c2|date=March 25, 1993}}</ref> In April, Millen was traded to the [[Dallas Cowboys]], and the Patriots drafted [[Drew Bledsoe]] with the first pick in the [[1993 NFL Draft]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Cowboys obtain Millen to fill quarterback void|work=[[The Victoria Advocate]]|page=1B|date=April 27, 1993}}</ref> During the offsesason, Carlson was released, leaving Secules, Zolak, Bledsoe, and Hodson to compete for the three spots on the roster. By the end of the preseason, Bledsoe had won the starting job and Hodson had been cut, with Secules as the backup and Zolak as the third-string quarterback.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hodson One Of 9 Who Are Out Of Job \ Pats' Parcells Pulls Real|work=[[Telegram & Gazette]]|date=August 24, 1993}}</ref> Zolak saw playing time in three games in 1993, and threw two incomplete passes.<ref name=pfr/> He became a [[restricted free agent]] in the offseason, but re-signed with the Patriots for three years.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ron|last=Borges|title=PATRIOTS Re-sign Coates Harlow In The Fold, Too|work=The Boston Globe|date=April 2, 1994}}</ref> As Secules was released during preseason, Zolak was set as Bledsoe's backup as the 1994 season began. As was the case in the 1993 season, he did not make a starting appearance, as Bledsoe played the full 16 games, however Zolak did see action in every game, primarily as the [[holder (American football)|holder]] for extra point and [[field goal (football)|field goal]] attempts. Over the course of the season, he completed five of eight passes for 28 yards in the two games in which he saw time at quarterback.<ref name=pfr/> The [[1995 New England Patriots season|1995 season]] was similar, with Bledsoe starting and Zolak backing him up. In September, Bledsoe separated his left shoulder in a game and sat out a week to heal, allowing Zolak to make his first start since 1992.<ref>{{cite news|title=Patriots' Bledsoe To Miss Falcons|work=[[The Chicago Tribune]]|date=September 27, 1995|page=6}}</ref> On October 1, 1995, Zolak took the field against the [[Atlanta Falcons]], and completed 24 of 45 passes for 252 yards and a touchdown, though the Patriots lost the game, 30&ndash;17.<ref>{{cite news|first=Mark|last=Potash|title=First-Rate Play by Second-String Quarterbacks|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=October 2, 1995|page=83}}</ref> While Bledsoe's doctors wanted him to sit out another week, he refused and played the next week's game against the [[Denver Broncos]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Ron|last=Borges|title=Bledsoe Wants In Sunday Against Doctor's Advice, He Says He's Ready To Go|work=The Boston Globe|date=October 5, 1985}}</ref> This again relegated Zolak to the backup position, where he remained for the rest of the season. He finished the season with 28 completed passes in 49 attempts for 282 yards, a touchdown, and a quarterback rating of 80.5.<ref name=pfr/>

The [[1996 New England Patriots season|1996 season]] began well for Zolak, whose contract was extended through 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/03/sports/transactions-093130.html|title=Transactions|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=C8|date=June 3, 1996}}</ref> However, to remain with the Patriots, Zolak took a $250,000 pay cut to work around the [[salary cap]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Terry|last=Price|title=Zolak Knows From Start With Patriots, He's Second To Bledsoe And Accepts It|work=The Hartford Courant|page=C3|date=August 28, 1996}}</ref> While he appeared set to keep his backup job heading into training camp, he faced tough competition from [[Jay Barker]]. While Zolak welcomed the challenge, his status as the backup quarterback began to seem hazy a few weeks into training camp.<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Madden|title=Zolak Won't Dwell On Idle Thoughts|work=The Boston Globe|date=August 16, 1996}}</ref> By the end of training camp, Barker had been cut, and Zolak's quarterback job was safe. He took the role of emergency quarterback throughout the 1996 season, with Bledsoe taking nearly all the snaps and [[Tom Tupa]] serving as the backup upon his signing. Zolak played in three games, completing one pass for five yards.<ref name=pfr/> He saw some playing time in the playoffs against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], but did not play in [[Super Bowl XXXI]]. Zolak also spent much of the season losing weight, as coach Parcells had ordered him to do.<ref>{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Cafardo|title=If Need Be, Martin Ready To Carry Day|work=The Boston Globe|date=January 5, 1997}}</ref> The 1997 season was more of the same for Zolak, backing up Bledsoe, though the Patriots did have a new coach in [[Pete Carroll]]. As training camp ended though, Zolak saw significantly more playing time during drills and the preseason matchups then he had under Parcells.<ref>{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Solloway|title=Pats' Zolak Not Itchy After Seven Years|work=[[Portland Press Herald]]|page=1D|date=August 29, 1997}}</ref> As the regular season came and went though, he saw minimal playing time. Zolak saw action in four games, completing six of nine passes for 67 yards and two touchdowns, giving him a quarterback rating of 128.2.<ref name=pfr/>

With Zolak coming to the final year of his contract in [[1998 New England Patriots season|1998]], he sat in his usual spot on the depth chart, in between starter Bledsoe and third stringer Tupa. He saw playing time in three games during the first three months of the season in relief of Bledsoe. His most significant appearance during this time came against the Atlanta Falcons on November 8, 1998, where he completed three of ten passes for 33 yards and an interception in a 41&ndash;10 loss.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mathis Impresses Reeves \ Falcon Does Great Job Of Blocking|work=Worcester Telegram & Gazette|date=November 9, 1998}}</ref> Near the end of the month, Bledsoe was sidelined with an injury and was questionable for the final November game.<ref>{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Cafardo|title=Quarterback Options Weighed Zolak May Have Chance To Take A Hike|work=The Boston Globe|date=November 26, 1998}}</ref> Bledsoe played in three more games, but his injury kept him from playing in the final two, giving Zolak his first starting appearance since 1995.<ref>{{cite news|title=N.F.L.

He played in six games and started two, completed 32 of 75 passes for 371 yards, three touchdowns, 3 interceptions, and had a passer rating of 61.8.<ref name=pfr/> Zolak's last appearance for the Patriots occurred in the playoffs, as Bledsoe was still injured, against the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]]. He completed 21 of 44 passes as the Jaguars eliminated the Patriots from playoff contention in a 25&ndash;10 loss.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jaguars 25, Patriots 10|work=[[United Press International]]|date=January 3, 1999}}</ref> He became an [[free agent#Restricted and unrestricted free agency|unrestricted free agent]] after the season ended, but was not asked back by the Patriots, ending his tenure there.

===Miami Dolphins===
After leaving the Patriots, Zolak was signed to a one-year contract by the [[New York Jets]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Zolak Signs A 1-Year Deal As Backup Quarterback With Jets|work=The Boston Globe|date=April 28, 1999}}</ref> With [[Vinny Testaverde]] considered the starter, Zolak was competing against [[Ray Lucas]] for a backup job. He was the second-string quarterback as training camp began, but his competition increased when the Jets signed [[Rick Mirer]] and left three quarterbacks to battle for two opens spots on the team.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/08/21/archive/main34421.shtml|title=Jets Squeeze By Eagles|work=[[CBS News]]|date=August 21, 1999}}</ref> Two days after acquiring Mirer from the [[Green Bay Packers]], the Jets released Zolak.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jets Cut Scott Zolak|work=United Press International|date=August 22, 1999}}</ref> In October, Zolak was signed to a one-year deal by the [[Miami Dolphins]] to serve as the backup quarterback behind [[Damon Huard]] and [[Jim Druckenmiller]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Zolak Is Signed As 3rd-String QB|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|page=3D|date=October 28, 1999}}</ref> He was later made the backup behind Huard, and made his only appearance of the season on November 21, failing to complete a pass in four attempts against the Patriots.<ref name=pfr/> As the 1999 season wrapped up, the Dolphins signed Zolak to a contract extension, keeping him on the team for another year.<ref>{{cite news|title=NFL Update|work=The Dallas Morning News|date=December 18, 1999}}</ref> Despite the retirement of [[Dan Marino]], the Dolphins cut Zolak in May, and he ended his professional career.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jason|last=Cole|title=Dolphins dump Zolak|work=The Miami Herald|date=May 22, 2000}}</ref>
