==Early life==
[[File:Santa feconj Mexico City.jpg|thumb|Thalia's birth city, [[Mexico City]].]]
Thal<U+00ED>a was born on August 26, 1971 in [[Mexico City, Mexico]]. She is the youngest of five daughters of Yolanda Miranda Mange, a painter who was Thalia's manager from 1980 to 1999; and Ernesto Sodi Pallares, a scientist, doctor of pathology, criminologist, and writer. Her four sisters are [[Laura Zapata]] (daughter of Guillermo Zapata P<U+00E9>rez de Utrera), Federica, Gabriela, and Ernestina Sodi.

When she turned one year old, Thal<U+00ED>a appeared in her first TV commercial in Mexico. When she turned four, she began taking ballet and piano classes at the [[National Conservatory of Music of Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Por Notimex |url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/celebrara-thalia-su-cumpleanos-40 |title=Celebrar<U+00E1> Thal<U+00ED>a su cumplea<U+00F1>os 40 [Thal<U+00ED>a&#93; - 25/08/2011 &#124; Peri<U+00F3>dico Z<U+00F3>calo |publisher=Zocalo.com.mx |date=August 25, 2011 |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}</ref> Thal<U+00ED>a's father suffered from [[diabetes]] when Thal<U+00ED>a was only six years old and died in 1977. Years later, Thalia realized that her father's death traumatized her drastically, since she couldn't talk to anyone for a whole year. This led to her being diagnosed with CDH, [[childhood disintegrative disorder]], which belongs to a series of developmental disorders caused by [[autism spectrum]].<ref>http://www.casatelenovela.com/2008/04/la_cantante_y_actriz_thalia_fu.html</ref> Her mother took her to many psychologists at an early age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.generaccion.com/noticia/127628/thalia-enmudecio-tras-muerte-su-padre |title=Thalia enmudeci<U+00F3> tras la muerte de su padre |publisher=Generaccion.com |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvynovelas.com/noticias/356657/thalia-confiesa-estuvo-muda-ano|work=TVyNovelas.com |title=Revista TVyNovelas |publisher=Tvynovelas.com |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}</ref>

Thal<U+00ED>a went to [[Liceo Franco Mexicano]] elementary school, where she learned to speak French and Spanish fluently at a very young age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musica.univision.com/artistas/thalia/biografia |title=Biograf<U+00ED>a de Thal<U+00ED>a &#124; Univision M<U+00FA>sica |publisher=Musica.univision.com |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}</ref> In 1976, a year before her father's death, she appeared in a Mexican movie ''La guerra de los pasteles'' ("War of Cakes"), although her name doesn't appear in the film credits.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180724/fullcredits#cast</ref> As Thal<U+00ED>a was also practicing various sports during her childhood, she was inspired by Romanian record-setting athlete [[Nadia Comaneci]]. Nadia's record gave Thal<U+00ED>a the desire to follow a career in entertainment. Her eldest sister, Laura Zapata, was also a singer and she used to take Thal<U+00ED>a with her to the theatre when she was a child; she passionately embraced acting at a very young age.

==Life and career==

===1981<U+2013>1989: Career beginnings and the Timbiriche era===

In 1981, when Thal<U+00ED>a was nine years old, she was incorporated as a vocalist in a children's group named Pac Man, which was formed in order to participate in a popular music festival,  known as ''Juguemos a cantar'' ("Let's play at singing"), a TV program by [[Televisa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mx.hola.com/biografias/thalia/biografia/ |title=Thal<U+00ED>a. Noticias, fotos y biograf<U+00ED>a de Thal<U+00ED>a |publisher=Mx.hola.com |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}</ref> Later, Pac Man changed their band name to "Din-Din". Thal<U+00ED>a performed various times along with Din-Din in occasional events and parties, touring all over Mexico. The band recorded a total of 4 studio albums between 1982 and 1983 (''En acci<U+00F3>n'', ''Recordando el Rock and Roll'', ''Somos alguien muy especial'' and ''Pitubailando''), and later it was disbanded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eil.com/shop/moreinfo.asp?catalogid=334256 |title=Thalia Din-Din En Accion Mexico vinyl LP album (LP record) (334256) |publisher=Eil.com |date=March 14, 2002 |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eil.com/shop/moreinfo.asp?catalogid=387057 |title=Thalia Pitubailando Mexico 12" vinyl single (12 inch record / Maxi-single) (387057) |publisher=Eil.com |date=March 14, 2002 |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eil.com/shop/moreinfo.asp?catalogid=387069 |title=Thalia Somos Alguien Muy Especial Mexico vinyl LP album (LP record) (387069) |publisher=Eil.com |date=March 14, 2002 |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eil.com/shop/moreinfo.asp?catalogid=387050 |title=Thalia Recordando El Rock And Roll Mexico 12" vinyl single (12 inch record / Maxi-single) (387050) |publisher=Eil.com |date=March 14, 2002 |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}</ref>

After Din-Din broke up in 1984, Thal<U+00ED>a participated as a solo artist in two annual music festivals of ''Juguemos a cantar''. In 1984, she placed second there with her interpretation of <U+00AB>Moderna ni<U+00F1>a del rock<U+00BB> ("Modern rock girl"); this brought her the opportunity to participate in the chorus of the popular musical ''Vaselina'', a child version of the successful musical ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', in which the band [[Timbiriche]] was acting and singing. The line-up of the band consisted of Sasha S<U+00F6>kol, Benny Ibarra, Erik Rub<U+00ED>n, Diego Schoening, Mariana Garza and [[Paulina Rubio]]. [[Timbiriche]] was highly promoted at the time by [[Televisa]], one of the most massive media enterprises globally and the most important in the Spanish-speaking world. Some time later, Thal<U+00ED>a obtained the protagonist role of Sandy Dee in the musical, and she performed in 500 theater presentations of ''Vaselina'' along with [[Timbiriche]].

In 1986, after the departure of Sasha S<U+00F6>kol from Timbiriche, Thal<U+00ED>a became a member of the band. By that time, Timbiriche had already recorded five albums. In the following year, Thal<U+00ED>a was offered to participate in the [[telenovela]] ''Pobre se<U+00F1>orita Limantour''; this production was actually Thal<U+00ED>a's debut as a TV actress. However, she appeared in only one episode.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211843/fullcredits#cast</ref> In the same year, she recorded with [[Timbiriche]] the principal theme of the [[Young-adult fiction|juvenile]] [[telenovela]] ''[[Quincea<U+00F1>era (telenovela)|Quincea<U+00F1>era]]'' ("Fifteen-year-old"), in which Thal<U+00ED>a was the co-protagonist with the role of Beatriz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alma-latina.net/Quinceanera/Quinceanera.shtml |title=Quincea<U+0144>era - telenovela |publisher=Alma-latina.net |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}</ref> The TV series was awarded as the <U+00AB>Best telenovela<U+00BB> by "Premios TVyNovelas" in 1988 and Thal<U+00ED>a was awarded as "the best new actress of 1988".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWQELqT9kGo |title=THALIA recibe premio tvnovelas por actriz revelacion en quincea<U+00F1>era |publisher=YouTube |date=February 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}</ref>

With [[Timbiriche]], Thal<U+00ED>a recorded four studio albums: ''Timbiriche VII'' (1987), the double album ''Timbiriche VIII y IX'' (1988) and ''Los cl<U+00E1>sicos de Timbiriche'' (1989). The last one is a compilation of the band's greatest hits, recorded originally in 1987, with new symphonic arrangements as it included the participation of Mexico's philharmonic orchestra.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.esmas.com/ritmoson-latino/artistas/251843?page=1 |title=Ritmoson |publisher=.esmas.com |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}</ref> In 1989, Thal<U+00ED>a departed from Timbiriche.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eunice Mart<U+00ED>nez Arias |url=http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/284817.vuelven-a-vivir-el-exito.html |title=Vuelven a vivir el <U+00E9>xito |publisher=Elsiglodetorreon.com.mx |date=July 6, 2007 |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}</ref> In that year, she also starred in another TV series, ''Luz y sombra'' ("Light and shadow"), which was her first protagonist role.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211824/</ref> Some time later she visited Los Angeles in order to take English courses in the University of California. She also attended music, singing, acting and dancing classes before beginning her career as a solo artist.

===1990<U+2013>1993: First albums as a solo artist===

In 1990, Thal<U+00ED>a returned to Mexico and released her first studio album as a [[solo artist]], self-titled  ''[[Thal<U+00ED>a (1990 album)|Thal<U+00ED>a]]'', which was produced by Alfredo D<U+00ED>az Ordaz, and published by [[Fonovisa Records|Fonovisa]], [[Televisa]]'s record label. From that album, she released a total of four singles that became huge radio hits : "Amarillo Azul", "Pienso en Ti", "Un Pacto Entre Los Dos" and "Saliva". The two last tracks were co-written by her and D<U+00ED>az Ordaz and they were considered as provocative at the time ("Un Pacto Entre Los Dos" was even labeled as a song with occult Satan-worship lyrics by various [[Far-right politics|far-right parties]]).<ref>http://www.revista-contacto.info/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9622:thalia-precursora-de-lady-gaga&catid=117:ultimas-noticias&Itemid=596</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://musica.univision.com/fotos/curiosas/slideshow/2011-08-25/thalia-40-anos-canciones-trayectoria-fotos-cumpleanos |title=Thal<U+00ED>a. 40 a<U+00F1>os, 40 canciones - Univision M<U+00FA>sica |publisher=Musica.univision.com |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}</ref>

In September 1991, Thal<U+00ED>a released her second studio album, ''[[Mundo de cristal]]'', which marks Thal<U+00ED>a's last project in collaboration with Alfredo D<U+00ED>az Ordaz. Four songs became radio singles from the album, and all of them had big radio impact in Mexico. Due to the success of the singles, the album was certified as double gold in Thal<U+00ED>a's native country, Mexico. In the same year, Thal<U+00ED>a was co-presenter of the late Spanish show ''VIP Noche'', along with Spanish presenter Emilio Arag<U+00F3>n, produced by [[Telecinco]].<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0321004/fullcredits#cast</ref>

In October 1992, she released her third studio album and her last under the same label, entitled ''[[Love (Thal<U+00ED>a album)|Love]]'', which was recorded in Spain and it was produced by Luis Carlos Esteban. The album spread six singles, that had huge radio impact: "Sangre", "Love", "No Trates de Enga<U+00F1>arme", "Flor de Juventud", "Mar<U+00ED>a Mercedes" (official theme of the TV series), and "La Vida en Rosa" ([[La vie en rose]]), the last one being a Spanish-French cover of the classic French song originally performed by [[Edith Piaf]]. Thal<U+00ED>a wrote the song "Sangre" inspired in D<U+00ED>az Ordaz, with whom she had broken up her sentimental relation. The album was praised by the critics, as it was an artistic evolution for Thal<U+00ED>a, who experimented for the first time in different [[music genres]], especially [[electronic music]]. The album reached number 15 on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]] ''[[Latin Pop Albums]]'' in 1993.<ref>http://www.allrovi.com/music/album/love-mw0000172049|work=allrovi.com</ref> In Mexico, it sold over 200,000 copies in the first month upon its release and very soon it reached the platinum and gold certification.

===1994<U+2013>1999: International breakout ===
In 1994, during the successful transmission of ''[[Marimar (telenovela)|Marimar]]'', Thal<U+00ED>a signed a contract with the record label [[EMI]] in order to prepare her fourth studio album that was entitled ''[[En <U+00E9>xtasis]]''. The album was released in October 1995. ''En <U+00E9>xtasis'' was produced with the aid of celebrated producers such as [[Emilio Estefan, Jr.]] (husband of the famous Cuban singer [[Gloria Estefan]]) and <U+00D3>scar L<U+00F3>pez.<ref>http://books.google.com.mx/books?id=STjcB_f7CVcC&lpg=PA835&dq=thalia%20m%C3%A9xico&hl=es&pg=PA835#v=onepage&q=thalia&f=false</ref> The album spawned a total of seven singles including "[[Piel morena]]", "[[Am<U+00E1>ndote]]", "[[Maria la del Barrio (song)|Mar<U+00ED>a la del barrio]]", "[[Quiero hacerte el amor]]", "[[Gracias a Dios (song)|Gracias a Dios]], "[[Me Faltas T<U+00FA>]]" and "[[L<U+00E1>grimas (song)|L<U+00E1>grimas]]". 
 
[[Piel morena]] became a huge international hit<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p29449/charts-awards/billboard-singles</ref> apart from being voted as the best Spanish song ever in the United States from a poll relaized by mass media company [[Univision]]. It must also be added that Thal<U+00ED>a was more oriented to the [[latin pop]] music genre in that album, even though it was influenced by various music genres.

The broadcast of the [[telenovelas]] "[[Mar<U+00ED>a Mercedes (telenovela)|Mar<U+00ED>a Mercedes]]", "[[Marimar (telenovela)|Marimar]]" and "[[Mar<U+00ED>a la del barrio]]" had already converted Thal<U+00ED>a to a global television phenomenon by the end of 1996. In January 1997, she released her first compilation album entitled ''[[Nandito Ako]]'', which contains four songs recorded in [[Tagalog]], a major language of the [[Philippines]], five English versions from various tracks from the album [[En <U+00E9>xtasis]] and a Spanish remix of the song [[Am<U+00E1>ndote]]. The only single that was released from this album was ''Nandito Ako''. The album became a commercial success in the Philippines as a result of Thal<U+00ED>a's growing popularity, reaching platinum status set by the [[Philippine Association of the Record Industry]].

In July 1997, Thal<U+00ED>a's fifth studio album was released, under the title ''[[Amor a la mexicana]]'', produced again by [[Emilio Estefan]], and including songs that became classic over the years like <U+00AB>[[Mujer Latina]]<U+00BB>, <U+00AB>[[De d<U+00F3>nde soy]]<U+00BB>, <U+00AB>[[Por amor (Thal<U+00ED>a song)|Por amor]]<U+00BB>, <U+00AB>[[Noches sin luna]]<U+00BB> and <U+00AB>[[Amor a la Mexicana (song)|Amor a la mexicana]]<U+00BB>.

With Amor a la mexicana, Thal<U+00ED>a was able to bring her music and establish her projects in difficult markets like those of France, [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Turkey]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], Italy and all the Spanish-speaking countries.<ref>http://anodis.com/galeria.asp?id=7</ref>

After the success of ''Amor a la mexicana'', Thal<U+00ED>a recorded the Spanish and Portuguese versions of the song <U+00AB>Journey to the Past<U+00BB>, produced by [[Atlantic Records]], as a part of the soundtrack of the [[Fox Animation Studios]] movie [[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1997).

In the following year, Thal<U+00ED>a starred for the first time in a movie in English, named "Mambo Caf<U+00E9>", written and directed by Reuben Gonz<U+00E1>lez.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1998_Nov_16/ai_53220016/ }}</ref><ref>http://www.thefreelibrary.com/%27Mambo+Cafe%27+Wraps+Principle+Photography%3B+Kushner-Locke+to+Distribute...-a053625991</ref> ''Mambo Caf<U+00E9>'' premiered in January 2000 in Mexico, Greece and Russia, distributed by Kushner Locke Entertainment.<ref>http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=7847&tabla=espectaculos</ref>

"Rosalinda" was considered to be [[Televisa]]'s most expensive production ever by that time, as well as the most exported in foreign countries, as it was sold in over 180 countries. In an interview of that period Thal<U+00ED>a commented: <U+00AB>The telenovelas are the ones that opened the doors of the world for me, because the audience of telenovelas is much more passionate than the audience of cinema. What's more, television is free<U+00BB>.<ref>http://www.terra.com.mx/entretenimiento/articulo/15327/Thalia+llena+su+mundo.htm</ref>

It was reported to be the most expensive music album produced in Latin America in 2005. It had mild success, although the sound and the overall result make it one of her most integrated projects. "[[Amar sin ser amada]]" was the first single of the album and is considered as an infectious rock-edged [[tango music|tango]]-based song. "[[Un alma sentenciada]]", the second single of the album, is a feverish and, at points, hyperdramatic ballad. The explosive "[[Seducci<U+00F3>n]]" ("Seduction") and "Olvidame" were also releases as singles, gaining considerable success. The album was also certified gold in Argentina, Greece and Mexico and double platinum in the United States.

In May 2008, Thal<U+00ED>a's single "[[Ten Paciencia]]", was premiered on the internet.<ref>{{Cite news |title=On Sale Today!!

==Acting career==

[[File:Thalia Mar<U+00ED>a.jpg|thumb|right|150px|<center>[[Mar<U+00ED>a la del barrio]], Thal<U+00ED>a's 1995 record-setting [[telenovela]] that was broadcast in more than 180 countries''.</center>]]
Thalia was cast in a supporting role in the 1986 [[telenovela]] "Pobre se<U+00F1>orita Limantour", with which she began her collaboration with [[Televisa]], the largest mass media company in the Spanish-speaking world. In 1987, she went on to star in her first major role for Televisa in the 1987 teenage drama series ''[[Quincea<U+00F1>era (telenovela)|Quincea<U+00F1>era]]'', along with Mexican actress [[Adela Noriega]]. "Quincea<U+00F1>era" won the "TV y Novelas" award for Best Telenovela of the Year 1988. In 1989, she got her first lead role in "Luz y Sombra", which was less successful.

However, Thal<U+00ED>a's explosion in popularity came in 1992, when she starred in "[[Maria Mercedes (telenovela)|Mar<U+00ED>a Mercedes]]" for which she won a "TV Y Novelas" award as Best Young Actress in 1993. This series was the first of three telenovelas, named by the Mexican press as "Las Tres Marias" ("The Three Mar<U+00ED>as"), because the name of the heroine in all of these telenovelas was ''Mar<U+00ED>a''. The second telenovela of the trilogy was "[[Marimar (telenovela)|Marimar]]" in 1994, and the third and final was "[[Maria la del Barrio]]" in 1995. In 1999, Thal<U+00ED>a starred in her latest telenovela, "[[Rosalinda (telenovela)|Rosalinda]]". All four telenovelas were basically based on the same rags to riches character.<ref name="tevnovelas.blogspot.gr">http://tevnovelas.blogspot.gr/2011/07/thalia-legendary-telenovela-actresses.html</ref>
With these [[telenovelas]], Thal<U+00ED>a became famous worldwide and was consolidated as a television phenomenon, because of the extremely high ratings her TV series achieved in more than 180 countries (especially [[Philippines]]).<ref name="tevnovelas.blogspot.gr"/><ref>http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/singers/thalia-mottola-net-worth/</ref>

Although Thal<U+00ED>a's presence in television is legendary, her presence in [[Filmmaking|cinema]] is less important. She appeared for the first time in a movie when she was still a child in the 1979 film "La Guerra De los Pasteles" ("The War of the Cakes"). Furthermore, in 1999, she starred in ''"Mambo Caf<U+00E9>"'', a modest [[independent film|indie]] film production that had a poor reception from critics, as it was a low budget film.

===Cultural impact of telenovelas===

Thal<U+00ED>a has been labeled by various mass media companies as the "queen of soap operas",<ref name="delafont">http://delafont.com/music_acts/thalia.htm</ref> because her presence in television during the decade of the 90s was phenomenal. She starred in Mexico's highest-rated [[telenovelas]] ever that were exported in over 180 countries and viewed by more than 2 billion people. It is stated by media experts that at some point at the midst of the telenovela craze, Thal<U+00ED>a's name even became synonymous with her native country, [[Mexico]].

According to the newspaper "Ivoir'Soir": "At 7.30 sharp in the evening, when Marimar comes on, everything stops in Cote d'Ivoire". It is also mentioned that "Marimar" could attract more local fans than the 1998 World Cup, and that the program arrived in Africa after being a phenomenal rating hit in Indonesia and the Philippines, where in 1997 she was received in [[Manila]] like a foreign [[head of state]].<ref>http://www.questia.com/library/1G1-54738757/soaps-with-a-latin-scent</ref>

Thal<U+00ED>a stated in her autobiography regarding to the impact of her [[telenovelas]]: "Soap operas made a lot of history; just look at the report by UNESCO, where it was noted that "in the [[Ivory Coast]] in Africa and in Paris (France), people stopped the daily course of their lives just to watch a soap opera. I never expected that kind of success [...] Whenever I arrived anywhere, I was treated like royalty; even the press in some of these countries referred to me as the Aztec Queen, the Mexican Queen, or the ambassador of Mexico, and like a proud peacock, I always brought my country's flag with me wherever I went to represent my motherland. I was in the clouds at the pinnacle of my career [...] During my visit at the Philippines, the organizers informed me that the last time so many people gathered in the streets for a person was when [[Pope John Paul II|Pope John Paul the Second]] came to visit on January fourteenth, 1995 [...] In the Philippines, the country that probably felt the greatest impact from Marimar, the show was more widely promoted than the 1998 World Cup and more highly rated than the Super Bowl or the Grammys. In fact while I was visiting the country, the people and the media were so enthralled to see [[Marimar (telenovela)|Marimar]] in the flesh that a historic peace treaty between the government and the querillas and the centennial celebrations of the [[Philippine Revolution]]s that were happening at the same time were pushed aside in the midst of Marimar fever. As a result, the archipelago was temporarily dubbed "Rep<U+00FA>blica de MariMar."

The phenomenon of Thal<U+00ED>a's telenovelas also became visible in countries like [[Indonesia]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Brazil]], [[Lebanon]], [[France]], [[Egypt]], [[Portugal]] and the majority of Spanish-speaking countries around the world.<ref>http://www.pep.ph/spotlight/looking-back/13166/The-Marimar-Craze</ref>
