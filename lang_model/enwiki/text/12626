'''Pudhumaipithan''' (also spelt '''Pudumaipithan''' or '''Puthumaippiththan''', <U+0BAA><U+0BC1><U+0BA4><U+0BC1><U+0BAE><U+0BC8><U+0BAA><U+0BCD><U+0BAA><U+0BBF><U+0BA4><U+0BCD><U+0BA4><U+0BA9><U+0BCD> in Tamil) is the pseudonym of '''Viruthachalam''' ([[April 25]],[[1906]] - [[May 5]], [[1948]]), one of the most influential and revolutionary writers of [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[fiction]]. His works were characterized by bold criticisms of social [[anomalies]], modern outlook and progressive thinking. Contemporary writers and critics found it difficult to accept his views and his works were  confronted with extreme criticism and hostility. He as an [[individual]] and his works have been extensively reviewed and debated through the years; but with time, he has found not only acceptance and appreciation but also an unparalleled position in the world of Tamil fiction - especially that of [[short stories]].

==Life==
Pudhumaipithan was born in Thiruppadirippuliyur ([[Cuddalore]]). He did his primary education in [[Senji]], [[Dindivanam]] and [[Kallakkuruchi]]. His father who was working as a [[Taluk|Tasildar]] under the [[British Raj]] retired in 1918 and he decided to return back to his birth place of [[Tirunelveli]]. Pudhumaipithan spent significant part of his life here and this forms the back drop for most of his works. He earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from the Hindu College in 1932. 

His career as a writer began in 1933 with an essay "Gulabjaan Kaadhal" (Love for Gulab Jamun) published in the magazine "Gandhi". His first short story "Aatrangarai Pillaiyaar" (Pillaiyaar on the river bank) was published in 1934 in "Manikodi" and from then on his short stories appeared regularly in it. At the end of 1934 he moved to [[Chennai]] where he worked as sub-editor in magazines such as Oozhiyan,Thina Mani and Thina Sari. In 1940, his book "Pudhumaipithan Kadhaigal"(The stories of Pudhumaipithan), an [[anthology]] of his short stories was published. He slowly ventured into the world of [[Tamil cinema]]. He worked for the movies Avvai and KaamaValli. He later started the "ParvathaKumari Productions", a movie production company. While working for the movie "Raja Mukthi", he moved to Pune. Here he was afflicted with [[tuberculosis]] and he finally succumbed to it.

==Works and Themes== 
Pudhumaipithan's writings brought him an image of a maverick. The subjects that he took and the characters he chose to convey them was completely new to Tamil fiction. He felt that Tamil literature was crippled by unsaid rules and conventions and he openly criticized those who adhered to them. In one of his articles he boldly expressed his displeasure -

''We have been having a notion that there are certain things that can be said and certain things that cannot be said in (Tamil)literature;and we have lived with the philosophy. But that is not the truth. For nearly two hundred years we have lived a life of [[parasites]]. We don't even dare to see issues straight on the face and that is why we have been providing excuses for ourselves. If literature can give birth to the malicious [[Ravana]], blood sheds and sinful [[allegory|allegories]], why can`t it give a place to the poor prostitute? The society doesn't rust because of that. Moreover, there is no way to preserve an antique that has already rusted.''

To voice his views he unleashed a wide range of characters, mostly common- husbands, wives, students, children, [[rickshaw]] drivers, villagers, beggars, whores, people whose voices and lives were suppressed, [[saint]]s, revolutionaries; and a few very uncommon - [[God]], ghosts, monsters, hospital beds. Some of his favourite themes were the fight between instincts and [[rational]] thoughts, the victory of the former in most cases,[[Hindu]] religion - its rules, rituals and laws, [[caste]] systems, the struggles for survival and the suppression of women in the Indian society.

==Writing Style==
Pudhumaipithan broke the long-standing myth that successful creations in the Tamil language needed to be either in the [[Chennai]] or [[Tanjore]] style of Tamil. Most of his characters spoke the Tirunelveli [[dialect]]. His stories were set either in Chennai  or in Tirunelveli, the two places where he spent considerable portions of his life. His writing style was unique in the sense that it had a dosage of both classical words - words not in common parlance; as well as words derived from [[Sanskrit]]. Gentle [[satire]] even while handling complicated and serious situations was his hallmark.

==Plagiarism and other criticisms==
Among the criticisms placed against him, the most serious has been accusations of [[plagiarism]].  There has been a long-standing debate on this issue blaming him of plagiarizing [[Guy de Maupassant|Maupassant]]'s works. In fact he himself had published his short story "Tamil Therindha Pondaati" (The wife who knew Tamil) with the foreword that it was based on Maupassant's work. His ardent supporters have argued that other than the above story, during his time none of the stories for which he had been accused of plagiarizing were translated into English from French, which he did not know.

There has also been minor criticisms regarding his writing style. Because of his strong penchant for elaborate description of situation, surrounding and characters, he seemed to have digressed from the plot on a few instances.

==Pseudonyms==
Pudhumaipithan wrote under different [[pseudonym]]s, but the name "Pudhumaipithan" was the one that became famous. Even he had a prejudice towards this name as he felt that this name was responsible in a minor way for the attraction of his readers towards his works. Some of his other pen names were S.V,Koothan,Nandhan,Oozhiyan,Kabhali and Sukraachari. Due to the issue of plagiarism his pseudonyms have been extensively researched. A theory exists that all the works that came under the name of "Nandhan" were not his original ideas.
