'''<U+00C1>lmos''' ({{IPA-hu|<U+02C8>a<U+02D0>lmo<U+0283>}}), also '''Almos'''{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=33}} or '''Almus''',{{sfn|Kirschbaum|1995|p=40}} (c. 820{{ndash}}c. 895) was{{spaced ndash}}according to the uniform account of Hungarian chronicles{{spaced ndash}}the first head of the "loose federation"{{sfn|Kirschbaum|1995|p=38}} of the [[Hungarian tribes]] from around 850. Whether he was the [[Sacred king|sacred ruler]] (''[[kende]]'') of the Hungarians, or their military leader ''([[Gyula (title)|gyula]])'' is subject to scholarly debate. He apparently accepted the [[Khazar Khaganate|Khazar]] [[khagan]]'s suzerainty in the first decade of his reign, but the Hungarians acted independently of the Khazars from around 860. The 14th-century ''[[Illuminated Chronicle]]'' narrates that he was murdered in Transylvania at the beginning of the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin]] around 895.

According to the ''Gesta Hungarorum'', <U+00C1>lmos was born to [[Emese]], a daughter of  "Prince Eunedubelian".{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=9}} However, Krist<U+00F3> writes that her name, containing the old Hungarian word for mother ''(em)'', may have been invented by Anonymus.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=9}} The name of <U+00C1>lmos's father is likewise uncertain because the Hungarian chronicles preserved it in two variants.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=9}} Anonymus states that [[<U+00DC>gyek]] was his name,<ref>''Anonymus, Notary of King B<U+00E9>la: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 3), pp. 12-13.</ref> but the 14th-century ''Illuminated Chronicle'' says that [[El<U+0151>d]]{{spaced ndash}}himself the son of <U+00DC>gyek{{spaced ndash}}was <U+00C1>lmos's father.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=9}} Krist<U+00F3> says that both names may have been the chroniclers' inventions, since <U+00DC>gyek's name derives from the ancient Hungarian ''<U+00FC>gy'' ("saint, holy") word, and El<U+0151>d's name simply refers to an ancestor.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=9}} Anonymus writes that <U+00DC>gyek married Emese in 819.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=9}} If this date is correct, <U+00C1>lmos was born around 820.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=10}}

Although Anonymus makes a connection between the name of <U+00C1>lmos and the Hungarian word for dream ''(<U+00E1>lom)'', many historians, including Andr<U+00E1>s R<U+00F3>na-Tas{{sfn|R<U+00F3>na-Tas|1999|p=227}} and Victor Spinei,{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=33}} argue that his name is of [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] origin. If the latter theory is correct, it has a meaning of "the bought one".{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|1996|p=166}} <U+00C1>lmos's family may have also been of Turkic stock, but according to Victor Spinei, a name's etymology does not always reflect its bearer's ethnicity.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=353}}

{{Quote|''In the year of Our Lord's incarnation 819, <U+00DC>gek&nbsp;...&nbsp;took to wife in [[Dentumoger]] the daughter of Prince Eunedubelian, called Emese, from whom he begot a son, who was named <U+00C1>lmos. But he is called <U+00C1>lmos from a divine event, because when she was pregnant a divine vision appeared to his mother in a dream in the form of a falcon that seemed to come to her and impregnate her and made known to her that from her womb a torrent would come forth and from her loins glorious kings be generated, but that they would not multiply in their own land. Because a dream is called'' <U+00E1>lom ''in the [[Hungarian language]] and his birth was predicted in a dream, so he was called <U+00C1>lmos.

== Reign ==
<U+00C1>lmos, according to ''Gesta Hungarorum'', was freely elected by the heads of the seven [[Magyar tribes|Hungarian tribes]] as their "leader and master".<ref>''Anonymus, Notary of King B<U+00E9>la: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 5), p. 17.</ref>{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=11}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=19}} Anonymus adds that to ratify <U+00C1>lmos's election, the seven chiefs "swore an oath, confirmed in pagan manner with their own blood spilled in a single vessel".<ref>''Anonymus, Notary of King B<U+00E9>la: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 5), p. 17.</ref>{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=19}} Anonymus says that they also adopted the basic principles of the government, including the hereditary right of <U+00C1>lmos's offsprings to his office and the right of his electors' descendant to have a seat in the prince's council.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=19}} According to author P<U+00E1>l Engel, this report of the "treaty by blood" ({{lang-hu|v<U+00E9>rszerz<U+0151>d<U+00E9>s}}), which reflects its authors' political philosophy rather than actual events, was "often presented by Hungarian historians as the very first manifestation of modern parliamentary thinking in Europe" up until 1945.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=19}}

In a sharply contrasting narrative from around 950, the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] states that instead of <U+00C1>lmos, his son <U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d was the first supreme head of the Hungarian tribes, and that <U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d's election was initiated by the Khazar khagan.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=33}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=12}} The emperor says the khagan sent an envoy to the ''"[[voivodes]]"'' (heads of the Hungarian tribes)<ref>''Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio'' (ch. 38), p. 171.</ref> after they had been forced by the [[Pechenegs]] to leave their dwelling places near the Khazar Khaganate and to settle in a new territory called ''[[Etelk<U+00F6>z]]''.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=12}} The khagan was planning to appoint one of the ''voivodes'' named [[Levedi]] to lead the Hungarian tribes{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=33}} to represent the khagan's interests.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=12}} Although Levedi refused the khagan's offer, he proposed one of his peers, <U+00C1>lmos or <U+00C1>lmos's son [[<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d]], to the proposed new position.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=12}}{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=33}} The khagan accepted Levedi's offer. Upon his initiative the Hungarians elected their first prince, but they preferred <U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d to his father.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=13}}{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=33}}

Gyula Krist<U+00F3> and many other historians refute Porphyrogenitus's report of the omission of <U+00C1>lmos in favor of his son, saying that the ''turul'' legend connected to <U+00C1>lmos's birth proves his role as forefather of his dynasty.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=13}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|1996|p=165}} These historians say that the emperor's account is based on a report by one of <U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d's descendants named Termacsu, who emphasized by this report of <U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d's election that only those descending from <U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d were suitable to lead the Hungarians; other children of <U+00C1>lmos were excluded.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=13}} Andr<U+00E1>s R<U+00F3>na-Tas says that Constantine Porphyrogenitus preserved the memory of a ''coup d'<U+00E9>tat'' organized against Levedi ''kende'' by <U+00C1>lmos ''gyula'', who had his own son <U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d elected as sacred ruler in his opponent's place.{{sfn|R<U+00F3>na-Tas|1999|p=330}} A late 9th-century Arabian scholar, al-Jayhani{{spaced ndash}}whose works were partially preserved in [[Ibn Rusta]]'s and other Muslim authors' books{{spaced ndash}}mentions the existence of these two high offices among the Hungarians.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=14}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|1996|p=104-105}} He describes the ''kende'' as the Hungarians' sacred ruler and the ''gyula'' as their military commander.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=14}} Historians still debate which of the two offices was held by <U+00C1>lmos.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=14}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=19}}{{sfn|R<U+00F3>na-Tas|1999|p=330}}

{{Quote|''The chagan said to'' [Levedi]'': "We have invited you upon this account, in order that, since you are noble and wise and valorous and first among the'' [Hungarians]'', we may appoint you prince of your nation, and you may be obedient to our word and our command." But he, in reply, made answer to the chagan: "Your regard and purpose for me I highly esteem and express to you suitable thanks, but since I am not strong enough for this rule, I cannot obey you; on the other hand, however, there is a voivode other than me, called'' [<U+00C1>lmos]'', and he has a son called'' [<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d]''; let one of these, rather, either that'' [<U+00C1>lmos] ''or his son'' [<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d]'', be made prince, and be obedient to your word."
