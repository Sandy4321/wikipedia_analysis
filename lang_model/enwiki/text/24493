[[Lithuanians]] in [[Chicago]] and the [[Chicago metropolitan area|nearby metropolitan area]] are a prominent group within the [[Origin of the name "Windy City"|"Windy City"]] whose presence goes back over a hundred years. Today Chicago possesses the largest [[Lithuanian World Community|Lithuanian community]] outside [[Lithuania]],<ref name=aidas><U+010C>ikagos aidas. [http://aidas.us/index.php?t=displayad&m_link_id=18 The Lithuanian Market]. Retrieved on 2008-09-04</ref> who have dubbed the city as '''Little Lithuania''', and many Lithuanian-Americans refer to it as the second capital of Lithuania.  [[Lithuanian-Americans]] from Chicago have had a significant impact on politics in both the [[United States]] and Lithuania.

==History==

Lithuanians have been documented as arriving in the US since 1918, when Lithuania [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|re-established its independence]] from [[Imperial Russia]].<ref name=aidas/> Although this is the first official record, Lithuanians began arriving at least two decades earlier; however, they were listed as Russian citizens.<ref name=aidas/> This is compounded by the fact that, prior to Lithuanian independence, most if not all official documents were written in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Polish language|Polish]] or [[German language|German]]. Thousands of Lithuanians have since moved to Chicago, providing a good source of labor for the growing city. The Lithuanian community in Chicago was most famously immortalized by [[Upton Sinclair]] in his [[1906 in literature|1906]] novel about the treatment of workers in the [[Union Stock Yards|Chicago stock yards]], ''[[The Jungle]]'', whose story revolves around telling the life of a Lithuanian immigrant named Jurgis Rudkus.

==Distribution==
The first and most prominent Lithuanian enclave in Chicago was called '''"Lithuanian Downtown"''' which was located along Halsted street in [[Bridgeport, Chicago|Bridgeport]] and founded by Lithuanians who settled nearby their [[Old World]] neighbors, the Poles, who were located in a [[Polish Patch]] in the vicinity of [[St. Mary of Perpetual Help]].<ref name="ahsd25.k12.il.us">http://www.ahsd25.k12.il.us/curriculum%20Info/Neighborhoods/bridgeport1.htm</ref> It was here that the Lithuanian church of Saint George was founded as the first Lithuanian parish in the Midwest, foreshadowing the prominence that [[Bridgeport, Chicago|Bridgeport]] would play as one of the key centers of Lithuanian activity throughout the United States.<ref>http://www.ahsd25.k12.il.us/curriculum%20Info/Neighborhoods/bridgeport2.htm</ref> A large number of the early buildings of this district were built by the first prominent Lithuanian community leader, Antanas Ol<U+0161>auskas (pronounced Ole-shau-skus), circa 1910.<ref name="ahsd25.k12.il.us"/> Centered on Thirty-third and Halsted, Bridgeport was Chicago's leading Lithuanian neighborhood from the 1890s through the 1950s. Although the numbers of Lithuanians in the area began to fall off in the 1950s, one of Lithuanian Chicago's longtime institutions, Healthy Food Restaurant on Halsted near Thirty-second street has closed its doors on December 15, 2009.<ref name="ahsd25.k12.il.us"/>

Although [[Lithuanians]] initially settled in areas adjacent to the ethnic group most familiar from their European homeland, the [[Polish Americans|Poles]], a pattern consistent with most other immigrant groups in Chicago, the Lithuanian community today is found all over the [[Chicago metropolitan area]]. There have been a number of Chicago neighborhoods in which Lithuanian immigrants have clustered during the 20th century, including [[Bridgeport, Chicago|Bridgeport]], [[Brighton Park, Chicago|Brighton Park]], [[Chicago Lawn, Chicago|Marquette Park]], and the [[Back of the Yards, Chicago|Back of the Yards]].  The adjacent near-western [[suburb]] of [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]] had an enclave of Lithuanians in the 20th century, especially around St. Anthony's Parish.  The most recent wave of immigrants has settled in the Chicago suburbs of [[Lemont, Illinois|Lemont]], [[Darien, Illinois|Darien]] and [[Woodridge, Illinois|Woodridge]].  There is a small enclave of Lithuanians around the [[Beverly Shores, Indiana|Beverly Shores]] area in northwest [[Indiana]] at the southern coast of [[Lake Michigan]].  Some Lithuanians moved on to work in Southern Illinois coal mines, such as Zeigler #1 in Zeigler, Illinois and lived in a fenced community for their protection from local miners.  Many gathered at the Lithuanian Hall in West Frankfort, Illinois for stage shows, dancing and movies.<ref>family history</ref>

==Significance==
[[Image:Valdas Adamkus.2007.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[Valdas Adamkus]] was an active member of the Lithuanian community in Chicago for decades before becoming President of Lithuania.]]
Today "Little Lithuania" is the center of [[Lithuanian culture]] in North America. It houses the only [[museum]] about Lithuanians in the Western Hemisphere, the [[Balzekas Museum of Lithuanian Culture]], which provides a wealth of information about Lithuania and Lithuanian culture. Little Lithuania has a number of Lithuanian restaurants, bookstores, and other shops. The former president of Lithuania, [[Valdas Adamkus]] 1998-2003 and 2004<U+2013>2009, is a former resident of the Chicago area as well. Chicago is home to the Consulate General of the Republic of Lithuania, and the city's large Lithuanian-American community maintains close ties to what is affectionately called the Motherland. Chicago's Lithuanian heritage is visible in the cityscape through its [[Lithuania]]n-named streets such as Lituanica Avenue and Lithuanian Plaza Court as well as an [[Art Deco]] monument in [[Marquette Park]] commemorating pilots [[Stasys Gir<U+0117>nas]] and [[Steponas Darius]] who died in the crash of the [[Lituanica]] in 1933.

A number of the most architecturally significant churches of the [[Archdiocese of Chicago]] were built as national parishes by Lithuanian immigrants such as [[Holy Cross in Chicago|Holy Cross]], Providence of God, and Nativity B.V.M., which is dedicated to our Our Lady of [[<U+0160>iluva]] or the now demolished St. George's in [[Bridgeport, Chicago|Bridgeport]].  Opulently decorated with a proclivity towards [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] ornamentation, Lithuanian churches were designed in the spirit of the architecture of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]'s heyday.  Like Chicago's [[Polish Cathedral]]'s, these churches were statements meant to recall an [[era]] when the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] spanned from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to the [[Black Sea]], having been built at a time when Lithuania was under [[Partitions of Poland|Russian occupation]] and incorporating Lithuanian imagery in its decor such as the [[Vytis]] to invoke pride in [[Lithuanian culture]].

There are many Lithuanian schools built near and in Chicago. Chicago Lithuanian Youth Center (''<U+010C>ikagos Lituanistin<U+0117> Mokykla''), a private school for Lithuanian immigrant children was founded in 1992. Other Lithuanian schools include [[Maironis]] in [[Lemont, Illinois|Lemont]], [[Gediminas]] in [[Waukegan, Illinois|Waukegan]] and Rasa in [[Naperville, Illinois|Naperville]]. There are also many Lithuanian newspapers circulating around Chicago, like ''[[Draugas]]'' (Friend), ''[[<U+010C>ikagos Aidas]]'' (Echo Chicago), ''Langas'' (Window), ''Amerikos Lietuvis'' (Lithuanian American), and ''[[Vakarai]]'' (The West).  

Years ago, the Lithuanian Song festival (''Dain<U+0173> <U+0160>vent<U+0117>'') and Dance Festival (''<U+0160>oki<U+0173> <U+0160>vent<U+0117>'') have been held at the now-demolished [[International Amphitheatre]], originally near the Stockyards on the south side of Chicago.  More recently, the Song Festival has been held at the [[UIC Pavilion]] a couple of times and the Dance Festival held in the suburb of [[Rosemont, Illinois|Rosemont]], not far from [[Chicago O'Hare Airport]].  

The [[Lithuanian Opera Company of Chicago]] was founded by Lithuanian emigrants in 1956,<ref name="lithopera">{{cite web

Lithuanian operas were sometimes held at [[Maria High School (Chicago, Illinois)|Maria High School]] in Chicago, a school that has been associated with Lithuanians, and such operas are now sometimes held at [[J. Sterling Morton High School District 201|Morton East High School]] in [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]].
