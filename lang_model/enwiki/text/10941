'''Alan Lehman Matheney''' ([[6 November]] [[1950]] - [[28 September]] [[2005]]) was a convicted [[murder]]er executed in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Indiana]]. He was convicted of beating to death his ex-wife, Lisa Bianco, with a [[.410 bore]] [[shotgun]], while on an eight-hour release from prison on [[4 March]] [[1989]]. At the time he was serving a sentence at [[Pendleton Correctional Facility]] for [[battery (crime)|battery]] and [[False imprisonment|confinement]] of Bianco. He was executed by [[lethal injection]] on [[28 September]] [[2005]] at [[Indiana State Prison]] at [[Michigan City, Indiana|Michigan City]].  Time of death was announced as 12:27 AM.

The eight-hour release pass authorized Matheney to travel to [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], instead he travelled to [[St. Joseph County, Indiana|St. Joseph County]]. He changed clothes and took a shotgun from a friend's house. He then travelled to [[Mishawaka, Indiana|Mishawaka]] and parked his car two houses down from Bianco's home. He broke into her house through the back door and then chased her down the street. He caught and beat her with the shotgun. While his two daughters and numerous neighbors looked on yet this case was held up on appeals for 16 years. The case caused a law change in the state, which required victims to be notified if an inmate was released. The State also agreed to pay the estate of Bianco [[US$]]900,000 in compensation.

At his trial he argued that he was legally insane. One mental health professional diagnosed him as having [[schizophreniform disorder]] and another said he had [[paranoid personality disorder]]. None said he was legally insane at the time of the crime. He stated that he believed Bianco was in a [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] against him. 

He refused to appear before a hearing of the [[Indiana Parole Board]] on [[19 September]]. Then on [[24 September]] [[2005]] the [[Supreme Court of Indiana|Indiana Supreme Court]] ruled 5-0 to reject a request for a new trial. Finally, [[List of Governors of Indiana|Governor]] [[Mitch Daniels]] denied clemency on [[27 September]].

His lawyer released a final statement that read:
:"I love my family and my children. I'm sorry for the pain I've caused them. I thank my friends who stood by me <U+2026> I'm sure my grandchildren will grow up happy and healthy in the care of their wonderful parents".

His [[last meal]] consisted of fried chicken, potato wedges, corn on the cob, biscuits and a chocolate shake.

This was the fifth execution in the state in [[2005]]. This is the most executions in a calendar year in [[Indiana]] since executions were resumed in [[1977]].
