'''"We Are the Winners"''' was the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]] entry into the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] for [[Lithuania]], sung by Lithuanian all-star group [[LT United]].

The song, thematically reminiscent of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s ''[[We Are the Champions]]'',  is a cheery [[tongue-in-cheek]] celebration of their supposedly inevitable victory at the Eurovision Contest in the form of a [[football chant]], with the chorus repeating "We are the winners of Eurovision / We are, we are! [...] So, you gotta vote, vote, vote for the winners!".

"We Are The Winners" is the fourth Eurovision song till 2006 to get [[Booing|booed]] {{Fact|date=May 2008}}. The third was [[Silvia Night]] for [[Iceland]] during the semi-finals in Athens 2006, although "We Are The Winners" was booed during the finals of the contest. The first was for the song "Love Games" by [[Belle & The Devotions]] in 1984, and the second was the song [[Ne Ver', Ne Boysia]] by [[t.A.T.u]]. {{Fact|date=May 2008}}

As Lithuania had not qualified for the final at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005 contest]], the song was first performed in the semi-final. Here, it was performed 18th, following the [[Netherlands]]' [[Treble (band)|Treble]] with "[[Amambanda]]" and preceding [[Portugal]]'s [[Nonstop]] with "[[Coisas de nada (Gonna Make You Dance)|Coisas de nada]]". At the close of voting, it had received 163 points, placing 5th in the 23-strong field and qualifying Lithuania for the final.

In the final, the song was performed fourteenth, following [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]'s [[Hari Mata Hari]] with "[[Lejla]]" and preceding the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Daz Sampson]] with "[[Teenage Life]]". At the close of voting, it had received 162 points, placing 6th in a field of 24 and giving Lithuania an automatic final berth at the next Contest. Perhaps unsurprising, its best points haul was from the [[United Kingdom]], a nation renowned for not taking the contest seriously, and awarding high marks to amusing (sometimes unintentionally so) acts. Its high score from the UK was probably helped by its performance coming immediately before the UK song.

Perhaps fittingly for a football chant-style song, LT United also recorded a version for the [[2006 Football World Cup]] with slightly altered lyrics ("We are the winners/Are you with us", for example). This recording appeared to be intended for any team to adopt, since Lithuania did not qualify for the finals of World Cup 2006.

==Trivia==
{{Trivia}}
At the after show press conference, winners [[Lordi]] sang the chorus of We Are The Winners as they entered.

The refrain of the song was performed live by [[Robbie Williams]] during his show in [[King Baudouin Stadium]] ([[Brussels]]) in [[June 13]], [[2006]].
