'''Bryce Canyon National Park''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|b|r|a<U+026A>|s}}) is a [[national park]] located in southwestern [[Utah]] in the United States. The major feature of the park is '''Bryce Canyon''' which, despite its name, is not a [[canyon]] but a giant natural [[amphitheatre|amphitheater]] created by [[erosion]] along the eastern side of the [[Paunsaugunt Plateau]]. Bryce is distinctive due to [[geology|geological]] structures called ''[[hoodoo (geology)|hoodoos]]'', formed by wind, water, and ice erosion of the river and lake bed [[sedimentary rock]]s. The red, orange, and white colors of the [[rock (geology)|rocks]] provide spectacular views for park visitors. Bryce sits at a much higher elevation than nearby [[Zion National Park]]. The rim at Bryce varies from 8,000 to 9,000&nbsp;feet (2,400 to 2,700&nbsp;m).

The Bryce area was settled by [[Mormon pioneers]] in the 1850s and was named after [[Ebenezer Bryce]], who [[homesteading|homesteaded]] in the area in 1874.<ref name="Kiver1999p523">{{harvnb|Kiver|1999|p=523}}</ref> The area around Bryce Canyon became a [[U.S. National Monument]] in 1923 and was designated as a [[National Park Service|national park]] in 1928. The park covers {{convert|56|sqmi|km2}} and receives relatively few visitors compared to Zion National Park and the Grand Canyon, largely due to its remote location. The town of [[Kanab, Utah]], is situated at a central point between these three parks.

==Geography and climate==
Bryce Canyon National Park is located in southwestern [[Utah]] about {{convert|50|mi|km}} northeast of<U+2014>and {{convert|1000|ft|m}} higher than<U+2014>[[Zion National Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/brycecanyonnationalpark/1561020006.html|title=When to go|work=Bryce Canyon National Park|publisher=Frommer's}}</ref><ref name="Harris1997p44">{{harvnb|Harris|1997|p=44}}</ref> The [[weather]] in Bryce Canyon is therefore cooler, and the park receives more [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]: a total of 15 to 18&nbsp;inches (38 to 46&nbsp;cm) per year.<ref name="Tufts1998p71">{{harvnb|Tufts|1998|p=71}}</ref><ref name="TheHoodoo">[[#TheHoodoo|The Hoodoo (Summer 2005)]]</ref> Yearly temperatures vary from an average minimum of {{convert|9|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C}} in January to an average maximum of {{convert|83|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C}} in July, but extreme temperatures can range from <U+2212>30&nbsp;<U+00B0>F to 97&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (<U+2212>34&nbsp;<U+00B0>C to 36&nbsp;<U+00B0>C).<ref name="TheHoodoo"/>  The record high temperature in the park was {{convert|98|F|C}} on July 14, 2002.  The record low temperature was {{convert|-28|F|C}} on December 10, 1972.<ref>http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ut1006; http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ut1007; http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ut1008</ref>

The national park lies within the [[Colorado Plateau]] [[United States physiographic region|geographic province]] of North America and straddles the southeastern edge of the [[Paunsagunt Plateau]] west of the Paunsagunt Fault (''Paunsagunt'' is [[Paiute]] for "home of the [[beaver]]").<ref name="Harris1997p46"/> Park visitors arrive from the plateau part of the park and look over the plateau's edge toward a valley containing the fault and the [[Paria River]] just beyond it (''Paria'' is Paiute for "muddy or elk water"). The edge of the [[Kaiparowits Plateau]] bounds the opposite side of the valley.
[[File:BryceCanyon-BrycePoint-Panorama.jpg|thumb|400px|alt=Landscape with red and pink rocks with some snow|Bryce Point]]

Bryce Canyon was not formed from [[erosion]] initiated from a central stream, meaning it technically is not a [[canyon]]. Instead [[headward erosion]] has excavated large [[amphitheatre|amphitheater]]-shaped features in the [[Cenozoic]]-aged rocks of the Paunsagunt Plateau.<ref name="Harris1997p46">{{harvnb|Harris|1997|p=46}}</ref> This erosion exposed delicate and colorful pinnacles called [[hoodoo (geology)|hoodoos]] that are up to {{convert|200|ft|m}} high. A series of amphitheaters extends more than {{convert|20|mi|km}} north-to-south within the park.<ref name="Harris1997p46"/> The largest is Bryce Amphitheater, which is {{convert|12|mi|km}} long, {{convert|3|mi|km}} wide and {{convert|800|ft|m}} deep.<ref name="Harris1997p46"/> A nearby example of amphitheaters with hoodoos in the same formation but at a higher elevation, is in [[Cedar Breaks National Monument]], which is {{convert|25|mi|km}} to the west on the [[Markagunt Plateau]].<ref name="Harris1997p44"/>

Rainbow Point, the highest part of the park at {{convert|9105|ft|m}},<ref name="Harris1997p53"/> is at the end of the {{convert|18|mi|km|adj=on}} scenic drive.<ref name="Harris1997p46"/> From there, [[Aquarius Plateau]], Bryce Amphitheater, the [[Henry Mountains]], the [[Vermilion Cliffs]] and the [[White Cliffs (Utah)|White Cliffs]] can be seen. Yellow Creek, where it exits the park in the north-east section, is the lowest part of the park at {{convert|6620|ft|m}}.<ref name="TheHoodoo"/>

==Human history==
[[Image:Petroglyphs in Bryce Canyon.jpg|alt=Images of geometric forms on a tan colored rock|thumb|[[Petroglyph]]s in Bryce Canyon indicate the presence of people in the area several thousand years ago, but little is known about them.]]

===Native American habitation===
Little is known about early human habitation in the Bryce Canyon area. Archaeological surveys of Bryce Canyon National Park and the [[Paunsaugunt Plateau]] show that people have been in the area for at least 10,000&nbsp;years. [[Basketmaker (culture)|Basketmaker]] [[Anasazi]] artifacts several thousand years old have been found south of the park. Other artifacts from the [[Pueblo]]-period Anasazi and the [[Fremont people|Fremont culture]] (up to the mid-12th century) have also been found.<ref name="Tufts1998p73">{{harvnb|Tufts|1998|p=73}}</ref>

The [[Paiute]] Indians moved into the surrounding valleys and plateaus in the area around the same time that the other cultures left.<ref name="Tufts1998p73"/> These [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] hunted and gathered for most of their food, but also supplemented their diet with some cultivated products. The Paiute in the area developed a [[Native American mythology|mythology]] surrounding the hoodoos (pinnacles) in Bryce Canyon. They believed that hoodoos were the Legend People whom the trickster [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]] turned to stone.<ref name="NPSguide">[[#NPSguide|NPS visitor's guide]]</ref> At least one older Paiute said his culture called the hoodoos ''Anka-ku-was-a-wits'', which is Paiute for "red painted faces".<ref name="Tufts1998p73"/>

===European American exploration and settlement===
It was not until the late 18th and the early 19th century that the first European Americans explored the remote and hard-to-reach area.<ref name="Tufts1998p73"/> [[Mormon pioneers|Mormon scouts]] visited the area in the 1850s to gauge its potential for agricultural development, use for [[grazing]], and settlement.<ref name="Tufts1998p73"/>

[[Image:Bryce Cabin circa 1881.jpg|Black and white photo of log cabin with thatched roof|thumb|left|Ebenezer Bryce and his family lived in Bryce Canyon, in this cabin, here photographed circa 1881.]]
The first major scientific expedition to the area was led by [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] Major [[John Wesley Powell]] in 1872.<ref name="Tufts1998p73"/> Powell, along with a team of mapmakers and geologists, surveyed the [[Sevier River|Sevier]] and [[Virgin River]] area as part of a larger survey of the [[Colorado Plateau]]s. His mapmakers kept many of the Paiute place names.<ref name="Harris1997p46"/>

Small groups of Mormon pioneers followed and attempted to settle east of Bryce Canyon along the [[Paria River]]. In 1873, the Kanarra Cattle Company started to use the area for cattle grazing.<ref name="Tufts1998p73"/>

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] sent Scottish immigrant Ebenezer Bryce and his wife Mary to settle land in the Paria Valley because they thought his carpentry skills would be useful in the area. The Bryce family chose to live right below Bryce Canyon Amphitheater. Bryce grazed his cattle inside what are now park borders, and reputedly thought that the amphitheaters were a "helluva place to lose a cow."<ref name="Kiver1999p523"/> He also built a road to the plateau to retrieve firewood and timber, and a [[canal]] to irrigate his crops and water his animals. Other settlers soon started to call the unusual place "Bryce's canyon", which was later formalized into Bryce Canyon.

A combination of [[drought]], [[overgrazing]] and [[flood]]ing eventually drove the remaining Paiutes from the area and prompted the settlers to attempt construction of a water diversion channel from the Sevier River drainage. When that effort failed, most of the settlers, including the Bryce family, left the area.<ref name="Harris1997p46"/> Bryce moved his family to [[Arizona]] in 1880.<ref name="TheHoodoo"/> The remaining settlers dug a {{convert|10|mi|km}} ditch from the Sevier's east fork into Tropic Valley.<ref name="Harris1997p46"/>

===Creation of the park===
[[Image:Bryce Canyon Lodge.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bryce Canyon Lodge]] was built between 1924 and 1925 from local materials.]]
These scenic areas were first described for the public in magazine articles published by Union Pacific and Santa Fe railroads in 1916.<ref name="Kiver1999p523"/> People like Forest Supervisor J. W. Humphrey promoted the scenic wonders of Bryce Canyon's amphitheaters, and by 1918 nationally distributed articles also helped to spark interest.<ref name="Tufts1998p73"/> However, poor access to the remote area and the lack of accommodations kept visitation to a bare minimum.

Ruby Syrett, Harold Bowman and the Perry brothers later built modest lodging, and set up "touring services" in the area.<ref name="Tufts1998p73"/> Syrett later served as the first [[postmaster]] of Bryce Canyon. Visitation steadily increased, and by the early 1920s the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]  became interested in expanding [[Rail transport in the United States|rail service]] into southwestern Utah to accommodate more tourists.<ref name="Tufts1998p73"/>

[[Image:Bryce Canyon visitors center.jpg|alt=Two story wood building next to flag pole with U.S. flag waving in the wind. Snow on ground.|thumb|left|In 1928 the canyon became a [[National Park]]. It now has this visitors' center.]]
At the same time, [[conservation ethic|conservationists]] became alarmed by the damage overgrazing and [[logging]] on the plateau, along with unregulated visitation, were having on the fragile features of Bryce Canyon. A movement to have the area protected was soon started, and [[National Park Service]] Director [[Stephen Mather]] responded by proposing that Bryce Canyon be made into a state park. The [[governor of Utah]] and the [[Utah Legislature]], however, lobbied for national protection of the area. Mather relented and sent his recommendation to President [[Warren G. Harding]], who on June 8, 1923 declared Bryce Canyon National Monument into existence.<ref name="Tufts1998p73"/>

A road was built the same year on the plateau to provide easy access to outlooks over the amphitheaters. From 1924 to 1925, [[Bryce Canyon Lodge]] was built from local timber and stone.<ref name="TheHoodoo_p5">[[#TheHoodoo|The Hoodoo (Summer 2005)]], p. 5</ref>

Members of [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] started work in 1924 on upgrading Bryce Canyon's protection status from a [[U.S. National Monument]] to a [[U.S. National Park|National Park]] in order to establish Utah National Park.<ref name="TheHoodoo_p5" /> A process led by the [[Utah Parks Company]] for transferring ownership of private and state-held land in the monument to the federal government started in 1923.<ref name="Tufts1998p73"/> The last of the land in the proposed park's borders was sold to the federal government four years later, and on February 25, 1928, the renamed Bryce Canyon National Park was established.<ref name="Kiver1999p524">{{harvnb|Kiver|1999|p=524}}</ref>

In 1931, President [[Herbert Hoover]] annexed an adjoining area south of the park, and in 1942 an additional {{convert|635|acres|km2}} was added.<ref name="Tufts1998p73"/> This brought the park's total area to the current figure of {{convert|35835|acres|km2}}.<ref name="Kiver1999p524"/> Rim Road, the scenic drive that is still used today, was completed in 1934 by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. Administration of the park was conducted from neighboring [[Zion Canyon National Park]] until 1956, when Bryce Canyon's first superintendent started work.<ref name="Tufts1998p73"/>

===More recent history===
The [[USS Bryce Canyon (AD-36)|USS ''Bryce Canyon'']] was named for the park and served as a supply and repair ship in the [[United States Pacific Fleet|U.S. Pacific Fleet]] from September 15, 1950, to June 30, 1981.<ref>{{cite DANFS|title=Bryce Canyon|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/b10/bryce%20canyon-i.htm|accessdate=November 16, 2008}}</ref>

[[Bryce Canyon Natural History Association]] (BCNHA) was established in 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brycecanyon.org/pages/about.htm|accessdate = November 16, 2008 |title = About Us | publisher = Bryce Canyon Natural History Association}}</ref> It runs the bookstore inside the park visitor center and is a non-profit organization created to aid the interpretive, educational and scientific activities of the National Park Service at Bryce Canyon National Park. A portion of the profits from all bookstore sales are donated to public land units. <!-- NEEDS CITESince BCNHA's inception in 1961, donations have exceeded [[United States dollar|$]]3.5 million. /NEEDS CITE -->

Responding to increased visitation and [[traffic congestion]], the National Park Service implemented a voluntary, summer-only, in-park shuttle system in June 2000. In 2004, reconstruction began on the aging and inadequate road system in the park.

==Geology==
{{main|Geology of the Bryce Canyon area}}
[[Image:Natural bridge in Bryce Canyon.jpg|alt=A large opening in red red with snow on top|thumb|Erosion of [[sedimentary rock]]s has created natural arches.]]
[[Image:Thor's Hammer - Bryce Canyon.jpg|alt=Thor's Hammer|thumb|Thor's Hammer.]]
The Bryce Canyon area shows a record of deposition that spans from the last part of the [[Cretaceous]] period and the first half of the [[Cenozoic]] era. The ancient [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environment]] of the region around what is now the park varied. The [[Dakota Sandstone]] and the Tropic Shale were deposited in the warm, shallow waters of the advancing and retreating [[Cretaceous Seaway]] (outcrops of these rocks are found just outside park borders).<ref name="Harris1997p51">{{harvnb|Harris|1997|p=51}}</ref> The colorful [[Claron Formation]], from which the park's delicate [[hoodoo (geology)|hoodoos]] are carved, was laid down as sediments in a system of cool streams and lakes that existed from 63 to about 40&nbsp;million years ago (from the [[Paleocene]] to the [[Eocene]] epochs). Different sediment types were laid down as the lakes deepened and became shallow and as the shoreline and [[river delta]]s migrated.

Several other formations were also created but were mostly [[erosion|eroded]] away following two major periods of uplift. The [[Laramide orogeny]] affected the entire western part of what would become North America starting about 70&nbsp;million to 50&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name="Kiver1999p524"/> This event helped to build the ancestral [[Rocky Mountains]] and in the process closed the Cretaceous Seaway. The Straight Cliffs, Wahweap, and Kaiparowits formations were victims of this uplift. The [[Colorado Plateau]]s were uplifted 16&nbsp;million years ago and were segmented into different [[plateau]]s<U+2014>each separated from its neighbors by [[fault (geology)|faults]] and each having its own uplift rate.<ref name="Harris1997p53">{{harvnb|Harris|1997|p=53}}</ref> The Boat Mesa Conglomerate and the Sevier River Formation were removed by erosion following this uplift.

Vertical joints were created by this uplift, which were eventually (and still are) preferentially eroded. The easily eroded Pink Cliffs of the Claron Formation responded by forming freestanding pinnacles in [[badlands]] called hoodoos, while the more resistant White Cliffs formed monoliths.<ref name="Harris1997p46"/> The brown, pink and red colors are from [[hematite]] (iron oxide; {{chem|Fe|2|O|3}}); the yellows from [[limonite]] {{chem|(FeO(OH)<U+00B7>''n''H|2|O)}}; and the purples are from [[pyrolusite]] ({{chem|Mn||O|2}}).<ref name="Harris1997p50">{{harvnb|Harris|1997|p=50}}</ref>  Also created were arches, [[natural arch|natural bridges]], walls, and windows. Hoodoos are composed of soft sedimentary rock and are topped by a piece of harder, less easily eroded stone that protects the column from the elements. Bryce Canyon has one of the highest concentrations of hoodoos of any place on Earth.

The formations exposed in the area of the park are part of the [[Grand Staircase]]. The oldest members of this supersequence of rock units are exposed in the [[Grand Canyon]], the intermediate ones in [[Zion National Park]], and its youngest parts are laid bare in Bryce Canyon area. A small amount of overlap occurs in and around each park.

==Biology==
[[Image:Young mule deer in Bryce NP.jpg|alt=Young deer in grass||thumb|alt=|[[Mule deer]] are the most common large animals found in the park.]]
More than 400 native plant species live in the park. There are three life zones in the park based on elevation:<ref name="TheHoodoo_p5" />  The lowest areas of the park are dominated by dwarf forests of [[pinyon pine]] and [[juniper]] with [[manzanita]], [[serviceberry]], and [[antelope bitterbrush]] in between. [[Aspen]], [[Populus sect. Aegiros|cottonwood]], [[Water Birch]], and [[Willow]] grow along streams. [[Ponderosa Pine]] forests cover the mid-elevations with [[Picea pungens|Blue Spruce]] and [[Douglas-fir]] in water-rich areas and manzanita and bitterbrush as underbrush. Douglas-fir and [[White Fir]], along with Aspen and [[Engelmann Spruce]], make up the forests on the Paunsaugunt Plateau. The harshest areas have [[Limber Pine]] and ancient [[Great Basin Bristlecone Pine]]<U+2014>some more than 1,600&nbsp;years old<U+2014>holding on.<ref name="NPSguide"/>

[[Image:Winter storm at Bryce Canyon.jpg|alt=Trees with snow on them|thumb|left|Bryce Canyon has extensive [[fir]] forests.]]
The forests and meadows of Bryce Canyon provide the [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] to support diverse animal life, from [[bird]]s and small [[mammal]]s to [[fox]]es and occasional [[bobcat]]s, [[mountain lion]]s, and [[American black bear|black bear]]s.<ref name="NPSguide"/> [[Mule deer]] are the most common large mammals in the park.<ref name="NPSguide"/> [[Elk]] and [[pronghorn antelope]], which have been reintroduced nearby, sometimes venture into the park.<ref name="NPSguide"/>

Bryce Canyon National Park forms part of the habitat of three wildlife species that are listed under the [[Endangered Species Act]]: the [[Utah Prairie Dog]], the [[California Condor]], and the [[Willow Flycatcher|Southwestern Willow Flycatcher]].<ref>[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], [http://web.archive.org/web/20080222050639/www.nps.gov/brca/ Bryce Canyon (archived home page)]</ref>  The Utah Prairie Dog is a threatened species that was reintroduced to the park for conservation, and the largest protected population is found within the park's boundaries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/brca/naturescience/upd.htm |title=Bryce Canyon National Park: Utah Prairie Dog |accessdate=17 November 2008 |work=National Park website |publisher=National Park Service, US Department of the Interior |date=22 February 2007 }}</ref>

About 170 species of birds visit the park each year, including [[swift]]s and [[hirundinidae|swallows]].<ref name="TheHoodoo"/> Most species migrate to warmer regions in winter, although [[jay]]s, [[raven]]s, [[nuthatch]]es, [[eagle]]s, and [[owl]]s stay.<ref name="NPSguide"/> In winter, the mule deer, mountain lion, and [[coyote]]s migrate to lower elevations.<ref name="NPSguide"/> [[Ground squirrel]]s and [[marmot]]s pass the winter in [[hibernation]].<ref name="NPSguide"/>

Eleven species of [[reptile]]s and four species of [[amphibian]]s have been found at in the park.<ref name="NPSrepam">[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], Reptiles and Amphibians</ref> Reptiles include the [[Crotalus oreganus lutosus|Great Basin Rattlesnake]], [[Short-horned Lizard]], [[Side-blotched Lizard]], [[Striped Whipsnake]], and the [[Tiger Salamander]].<ref name="NPSrepam"/>

Also in the park are the black, lumpy, very slow-growing colonies of [[cryptobiotic soil]], which are a mix of [[lichen]]s, [[algae]], [[fungus|fungi]], and [[cyanobacteria]]. Together these [[organism]]s slow erosion, add [[nitrogen]] to soil, and help it to retain moisture.

While humans have greatly reduced the amount of habitat that is available to wildlife in most parts of the United States, the relative scarcity of water in southern Utah restricts human development and helps account for the region's greatly enhanced diversity of wildlife.

==Activities==
[[Image:Snowshoers in Bryce Canyon.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A line of snowshoers with colorful rock cliff in background.|There are marked trails for [[hiking]], for which [[snowshoe]]s are required in winter.]]
[[File:USA 10638 Bryce Canyon Luca Galuzzi 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Navajo Trail. Trees are [[Pseudotsuga menziesii]] and [[Pinus ponderosa]].]]

Most park visitors sightsee using the scenic drive, which provides access to 13 viewpoints over the amphitheaters. Bryce Canyon has eight marked and maintained [[hiking]] trails that can be hiked in less than a day (round trip time, trailhead):<ref name="TheHoodoo_p6">[[#TheHoodoo|The Hoodoo (Summer 2005)]], p. 6</ref> Mossy Cave (one hour, [[Utah State Route 12|State Route 12]] northwest of Tropic), [[Bryce Canyon National Park Scenic Trails Historic District|Rim Trail]] (5<U+2013>6 hours, anywhere on rim), Bristlecone Loop (one hour, Rainbow Point), and Queens Garden (1<U+2013>2 hours, Sunrise Point) are easy to moderate hikes. Navajo Loop (1<U+2013>2 hours, Sunset Point) and Tower Bridge (2<U+2013>3 hours, north of Sunrise Point) are moderate hikes. Fairyland Loop (4<U+2013>5 hours, Fairyland Point) and Peekaboo Loop (3<U+2013>4 hours, Bryce Point) are strenuous hikes. Several of these trails intersect, allowing hikers to combine routes for more challenging hikes.

The park also has two trails designated for overnight hiking: the {{convert|9|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Riggs Spring Fire Trail|Riggs Spring Loop Trail]] and the {{convert|23|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Under-the-Rim Trail]].<ref name="TheHoodoo_p7">[[#TheHoodoo|The Hoodoo (Summer 2005)]], p. 7</ref> Both require a backcountry camping permit. In total there are {{convert|50|mi|km}} of trails in the park.

[[Image:Horseriders in Bryce Canyon-NPS photo.jpg|alt=Horseriders on a dirt trail going toward pillars of pink rock|left|thumb|[[Horse riding]] is available in the park from April through October.]]
More than {{convert|10|mi|km}} of marked but ungroomed [[skiing]] trails are available off of Fairyland, Paria, and Rim trails in the park. Twenty miles (32&nbsp;km) of connecting groomed ski trails are in nearby [[Dixie National Forest]] and Ruby's Inn.

The air in the area is so clear that on most days from Yovimpa and Rainbow points, [[Navajo Mountain]] and the Kaibab Plateau can be seen {{convert|90|mi|km}} away in [[Arizona]].<ref name="NPS Farview"/> On extremely clear days, the Black Mesas of eastern Arizona and western [[New Mexico]] can be seen some {{convert|160|mi|km}} away.<ref name="NPS Farview">[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], Farview</ref>

The park also has a 7.4&nbsp;magnitude night sky, making it one of the darkest in North America.<ref name="TheHoodoo_p9">[[#TheHoodoo|The Hoodoo (Summer 2005)]], p. 9</ref> Stargazers can therefore see 7,500 stars with the [[naked eye]], while in most places fewer than 2,000 can be seen due to [[light pollution]] (in many large cities only a few dozen can be seen). Park rangers host public stargazing events and evening programs on astronomy, nocturnal animals, and night sky protection. The Bryce Canyon Astronomy Festival, typically held in June, attracts thousands of visitors. In honor of this astronomy festival, [[49272 Bryce Canyon|Asteroid 49272]] was named after the national park.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/lists/NumberedMPs045001.html| title=Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (45001)-(50000)| author=[[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]: Minor Planet Center| accessdate=May 22, 2007 }}</ref>

There are two campgrounds in the park, North Campground and Sunset Campground.<ref name="NPS Campgrounds">[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], Campgrounds</ref> Loop A in North Campground is open year-round. Additional loops and Sunset Campground are open from late spring to early autumn. The 114-room [[Bryce Canyon Lodge]] is another way to overnight in the park.<ref name="NPS Lodging">[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], Lodging</ref>

A favorite activity of most visitors is landscape photography. With Bryce Canyon's high altitude and clean air, the sunrise and sunset photographs can be spectacular.
