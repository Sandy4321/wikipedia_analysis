The '''Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive''' is a scenic route within [[Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore]], in western [[Northern Michigan]], United States. The roadway, with its "scenic vistas and gentle curves",<ref name= schmidt>{{cite news |last= Schmidt |first= William E. |date= June 5, 1988 |title=  Michigan: Between the Lake and the Bay, the Leelanau Peninsula |url= http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/05/travel/eight-auto-trips-back-roadsto-towering-mountain-passes-michigan-between-lake-bay.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |work= [[The New York Times]] |accessdate= September 12, 2011}}</ref> is located off state highway [[M-109 (Michigan highway)|M-109]] between [[Empire, Michigan|Empire]] and [[Glen Arbor, Michigan|Glen Arbor]]. It runs for {{convert|7.4|mi|km}} through forest and dunes areas providing access to scenic overlooks of the [[Lake Michigan]] shoreline and the surrounding park land. Interpretive markers along the roadway are keyed to the [[National Park Service]]'s guide to the drive. Over 80,000&nbsp;vehicles make the trip in addition to bicyclists, hikers and skiers who use the road
each year.

The road was built in the 1960s and finished in 1967 by Pierce Stocking. A lumberman with road-building experience, he wanted to share the beauty of the area with others. He operated the facility until his death in 1976; afterwards it was purchased by the National Park Service and added to the park. In the 1980s, a two-year program reconstructed the roadway and added a number of features for visiting tourists. In 2011, the morning show, ''[[Good Morning America]]'' named the Sleeping Bear Dunes, and Pierce Stocking Drive, as the "Most Beautiful Place in America" after a viewer poll on its website; publicity since the award has increased traffic along the roadway.

The road is a {{convert|7.4|mi|km|adj=on}} loop that can be driven or bicycled. Hiking the roadway is permitted, but not encouraged because of the traffic.<ref name=weeks/> The roadway starts at an entrance off [[M-109 (Michigan highway)|M-109]] (DH Day Highway) south of [[Glen Lake]]. There is a parking lot inside the entrance for visitors who wish to bike or hike the road. From there, the drive continues as a two-way road to the entrance gate before turning northward as a [[one-way traffic|one-way road]]. There are 12 numbered locations along the road that are listed in the drive's interpretive brochure. The first of these is a [[covered bridge]]. After this point, the drive ascends a steep hill to an overlook of Glen Lake. The area around this location includes "heavily forested areas, sand plains and scrub growth among the rock outcrops".<ref name=nofziger>{{cite news |last= Nofziger |first= Fred |date= July 29, 1984 |title= Sleeping Bear Dunes: Michigan's Sandy Ice-Age Playground |url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zlpPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OwMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1935,3604158&dq=pierce+stocking+scenic+drive&hl=en |work= [[The Blade (newspaper)|The Blade]] |location= Toledo, OH |page= F7 |accessdate= September 12, 2011}}</ref> The next stop is the Dune Overlook and Picnic Mountain picnic area. From this vantage point, tourists can view both [[North Manitou Island|North]] and [[South Manitou Island|South]] Manitou islands, also part of the park, as well as Pyramid Point and Sleeping Bear Bay. As the drive approaches this stop and the fourth, the Cottonwood Trail, it emerges from the forest into the sandy dune area next to Lake Michigan. Several more stops are noted in the guide before Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive heads back inland through the beech and maple forest.<ref name=dufresne/>

The roadway turns back to the shore and two overlooks next to the lake. Overlook&nbsp;9 is next to the bluff on Lake Michigan, {{convert|450|ft|m}} above the water, and overlook&nbsp;10 is for views of the Sleeping Bear Dune. From overlook&nbsp;9, visitors can see [[Platte River (Michigan)|Platte Bay]] some {{convert|9.0|mi}} to the south on a clear day.<ref name=dufresne/><ref name=weeks/> These two locations are considered especially hazardous because of the heights involved. In 2002, the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' noted that a half-dozen visitors have to be rescued by paramedics at these two overlooks after falls. The community of [[Glen Arbor, Michigan|Glen Arbor]] has a special [[off-road vehicle]] to effect rescues from the base of the cliffs.<ref name=ager>{{cite news |last= Ager |first= Susan |date= July 9, 2002 |title= Human Nature Takes Plunge, Pays the Price |work= [[Detroit Free Press]] |page= G1}}</ref> The penultimate stop along the drive is the North Bar Overlook and Picnic Area, which provides vistas of North Bar Lake. After this stop, the drive descends into maple and pine forests before coming back to the starting point.<ref name=dufresne/><ref name=weeks/> This area follows an old logging road under the forest canopy.<ref name=nofziger/> The drive has been called "the best way to see Lake Michigan from top of the dune elevations",<ref name=phipps>{{cite book |last= Phipps |first= Makena Elizabeth |year= 2004 |chapter= Forward |editor1-last= Phipps |editor1-first= Terry W |title= Seasons of Sleeping Bear |location= Ann Arbor, MI |publisher= University of Michigan Press |page=5 |isbn= 0-472-11445-X}}</ref> and "one of the nation's most fascinating landscapes".<ref name=NatGeo/>

A Park Pass fee is required for using the Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive (except for [[Golden Age Passport|Golden Age Passport/Senior Pass]] holders). A free interpretive guide for the scenic drive is available at the visitor center in Empire, Michigan, or at the entrance gate.<ref name=NPSguide/> The road is open to cars generally from the middle of April into November. During the operating system, the road is open from 9:00 a.m. to 30 minutes after sunset.<ref name=nps-hours>{{cite web |author=Staff |title= Operating Hours & Seasons |url= http://www.nps.gov/slbe/planyourvisit/hours.htm |work= [[Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore]] |publisher= [[National Park Service]] |date= January 5, 2011 |accessdate= September 12, 2011}}</ref> After late December, the drive is used as a [[cross-country ski]] trail. The park service combines the unplowed roadway with the Shauger Hill Trail to form an eight-mile (12.8&nbsp;km) system of trails of various ratings. The speed limit on the Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive is {{convert|20|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=dufresne/> In 2008, there were 82,527&nbsp;vehicles that circled the drive, a 4.7% increase over the previous year.<ref name=numbers>{{cite news |date= January 21, 2009 |title= Numbers at Park Lowest Since '87 |url= http://www.leelanaunews.com/drupal/?q=node/4068 |work= The Leelanau Enterprise |location= Lake Leelanau, MI |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/61eb83CvV |archivedate= September 12, 2011 |accessdate= September 12, 2011 |deadurl=no}}

==History==
[[Image:Glen Lakes.jpg|thumb|right|Big Glen Lake (top) easterly, Little Glen Lake (foreground)]]
The road is named after Pierce Stocking, who spent his youth working as a Michigan lumberman and used to walk these bluffs above Lake Michigan. As a lumberman he had experience building roads. Stocking began building a road to the top of the dunes in the difficult terrain around the early 1960s.<ref name=dufresne/> According to ''[[National Geographic]]'', Stocking was "so awed by the beauty of the dunes that ... he built the road  in order to share them with visitors."<ref name=NatGeo>{{cite book |author= National Geographic Society |authorlink= National Geographic Society |title= Guide to Scenic Highways and Byways |edition= 2nd |location= Washington, DC |publisher= National Geographic Society |page= 125 |isbn= 0-7922-7468-7}}</ref> The road was originally known as the Sleeping Bear Dunes Park when he first opened it to the public in 1967. He operated the scenic drive until his death in 1976, charging $2 per car (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2|1976|r=2}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}{{inflation-fn|US}}) at the end.<ref name=dufresne>{{cite book |last= DuFresne |first= Jim |year= 2005 |title= The Complete Guide to Michigan Sand Dunes |location= Ann Arbor, MI |publisher= [[University of Michigan Press]] |pages= 109<U+2013>11 |isbn= 0-472-03118-X}}</ref> 

The area around the roadway became part of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore when the park was created in 1970,<ref name=schmidt/> and the road became part of park itself in 1977 when purchased by the park service. The name was later changed to Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive in honor the man. Starting in 1984, the National Park Service reconstructed the drive. It was paved for the first time, and a bicycle lane was added. The service also moved the entrance to the road and built the observation platforms.<ref name=dufresne/> An original section of the road was closed because it was susceptible to drifting sands from the dunes. Stocking built the covered bridge, but the "NPS has maintained it and increased its vertical clearance to 13&nbsp;feet 6&nbsp;inches [{{convert|13.5|ft|m|2|disp=output only}}]."<ref name=weeks>{{cite book |last= Weeks |first= George |year= 2005 |title= Sleeping Bear: Yesterday & Today |edition= 2nd |location= Ann Arbor, MI |publisher= University of Michigan Press |pages= 149<U+2013>52 |isbn= 0-472-03031-0}}</ref> The renovations to the drive were completed in 1986.<ref name=weeks/>

In August 2011, the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore was named by ''Good Morning America'' as the "Most Beautiful Place in America";<ref name=GMA>{{cite news |last1= Orso |first1= Alberto |last2= Parise |first2= Sabrina |date= August 17, 2011 |title= Sleeping Bear Dunes Voted 'Most Beautiful Place in America' |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/best_places_USA/sleeping-bear-dunes-michigan-voted-good-morning-americas/story?id=14319616 |work= [[Good Morning America]] |location= New York |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]] |accessdate= September 12, 2011 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/61eZvJ5x8 |archivedate= September 12, 2011 |deadurl=no}}</ref> the designation came after a [[social media]] campaign to capitalize on the show's website poll.<ref name=lovy>{{cite journal |last= Lovy |first= Howard |date= August 24, 2011 |title= The Sleeping Giant Behind Sleeping Bear: How Scenery and Social Media Created 'The Most Beautiful Place in America' |url= http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20110824/FREE/110829951# |journal= Crain's Detroit Business |location= Detroit |publisher= [[Crain Communications]] |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/61eZQV1Bk |archivedate= September 12, 2011 |accessdate= September 12, 2011 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Since the park was awarded the title, attendance has increased. Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive, featured in the morning show's broadcast, had {{convert|0.25|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} lines of cars waiting to get onto the drive on September 3, 2011, an uncommon sight for a day in September.<ref name=hubbell>{{cite news |last1=Hubbell |first1= Amy |last2= Campbell |first2= Alan |date= September 8, 2011 |title=
