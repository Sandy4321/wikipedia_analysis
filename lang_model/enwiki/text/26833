An '''information''' (or '''informational''') '''cascade''' occurs when people observe the actions of others and then make the same choice that the others have made, independently of their own private information signals. Because it is usually sensible to do what other people are doing, the phenomenon is assumed to be the result of [[rational]] choice. Nevertheless, information cascades can sometimes lead to arbitrary or even erroneous decisions. The concept of information cascades is based on [[social learning theory|observational learning theory]] and was formally introduced in a 1992 article by Sushil Bikhchandani, [[David Hirshleifer]], and [[Ivo Welch]].<ref name="bhw1992">Bikhchandani, S., Hirshleifer, D., and Welch, I. (1992), "A Theory of Fads, Fashion, Custom, and Cultural Change as Informational Cascades," ''Journal of Political Economy'', Volume 100, Issue 5, pp. 992-1026.</ref>. A less technical article was released by the authors in 1998.<ref name="bhw1998">Bikhchandani, S., Hirshleifer, D., and Welch, I. (1998), "Learning from the Behavior of Others: Conformity, Fads, and Informational Cascades," ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', Volume 12, Issue 3, pp. 151-170.</ref>

Information cascades are fragile because new information can overturn a long-standing behavioral trend. Because people are rational, they realize that their behavior is based on limited information and are willing to change. Thus, even though a thousand people may have chosen one action, a single new piece of information can induce people to subsequently choose a different action. 

There are two key conditions in an information cascade model:
#Sequential decisions with subsequent actors observing decisions (not information) of previous actors.
#A limited action space (e.g. an adopt/reject decision).<ref>[http://www.info-cascades.info Information Cascades and Rational Herding: An Annotated Bibliography and Resource Reference]</ref>

==Examples and fields of application==

Information cascades occur in situations where seeing many people make the same choice provides evidence that outweighs ones own judgment.  That is, one thinks:  "It's more likely that I'm wrong than that all those other people are wrong.  Therefore, I will do as they do."

=== Market cascades ===

Information cascades have become one of the topics of [[behavioral economics]], as they are often seen in financial markets where they can feed speculation and create cumulative and excessive [[market price|price moves]], either for the whole market ([[bubble (economics)|market bubble]]...) or a specific asset, for example a stock that becomes overly popular among investors.

Information cascades are usually considered by economists:
* as products of [[rational expectations]] at their start, 
* as irrational [[herd behavior]] if they persist for too long, which signals that collective emotions come also into play to feed the cascade.

=== Historical examples ===

* Small protests began in [[Leipzig]], Germany in 1989 with just a handful of activists challenging the [[German Democratic Republic]].<ref name=shirky>{{cite book

Two days later the [[Berlin Wall]] was dismantled.<ref name=shirky/>

* The adoption rate of drought-resistant hybrid seed corn during the [[Great Depression]] and [[Dust Bowl]] was slow despite its significant improvement over the previously available seed corn. Researchers at [[Iowa State University]] were interested in understanding the public's hesitation to the adoption of this significantly improved technology.

==Legal aspects==

The negative effects of informational cascades sometimes become a legal concern and laws have been enacted to neutralize them. [[Ward Farnsworth]], a law professor, analyzed the legal aspects of informational cascades and gave several examples in his book ''The Legal Analyst'': in many [[military court]]s, the officers voting to decide a case vote in reverse rank order (the officer of the lowest rank votes first), and he suggested it may be done so the lower-ranked officers would not be tempted by the cascade to vote with the more senior officers, who are believed to have more accurate judgement; another example is that countries such as [[Israel]] and [[France]] have laws that prohibit polling days or weeks before [[election]]s to prevent the effect of informational cascade that may influence the election results.<ref> Farnsworth, Ward (2007).
