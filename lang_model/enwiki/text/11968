'''"Word of God Speak"''' is a song by [[contemporary Christian]]/[[Christian Rock]] band [[MercyMe]]. Written by Bart Millard and Pete Kipley, "Word of God Speak" uses sparse instrumentation, featuring only [[piano]] and [[string section|strings]] to accompany Millard's vocals. The lyrics to "Word of God Speak" reflect on the idea that it is impossible to speak of an infinite God with a limited vocabulary.

Released as the second single from MercyMe's 2002 album ''[[Spoken For]]'', "Word of God Speak" attained consideable success on Christian radio, spending twenty-three weeks atop the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Christian Songs]] chart, a record for that chart; it spent a total of seventy-six weeks on that chart altogether. It also topped the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Christian AC]] chart and the ''[[Radio & Records]]'' Christian AC and INSPO charts, and peaked at No. 25 on the Christian CHR chart. ''Billboard'' magazine ranked "Word of God Speak" at the top spot on their 2000s decade-end Christian Songs and Hot Christian AC charts. "Word of God Speak" also won the [[GMA Dove Awards|Dove Awards]] for [[Dove Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and Pop/Contemporary Song of the Year at the [[35th GMA Dove Awards]].

==Background==
MercyMe's lead singer Bart Millard wrote "Word of God Speak" while touring in support of their single "[[I Can Only Imagine]]". The travel was exhausting, and Millard commented in an interview that, on one of the nights on tour, he "went to bed just really frustrated... It started feeling like everything I was saying was the same. I just thought, I have nothing else to say. So I went to bed with that on my mind". After falling asleep, Millard woke up early in the morning and wrote several lines to the song in his journal before going back to sleep. Several weeks later, he was searching through his journal and found the notes again; when he went to the band's studio, he showed the notes to his producer, Pete Kipley. The two finished the lyrics to the song in less than thirty minutes, and recorded the piano track the same night; they also brought in someone to compose a string track for the song. Millard wanted "Word of God Speak" to contain only piano, avoiding the big production that could assure the song success on the radio, as he felt the simple production would mirror the lyrics.<ref name="Song Story">{{cite web|url=http://www.crosswalk.com/church/worship/song-story-word-of-god-speak-by-mercy-me-1270043.html|title=Song Story: "Word of God Speak" by MercyMe|last=Hambrick|first=Melissa|date=June 23, 2004|work=''[[Crosswalk.com]]''|accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref>
