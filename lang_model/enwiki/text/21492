'''''Final Destination 2''''' is a 2003 American [[Supernatural fiction|supernatural]] [[horror film]] directed by [[David R. Ellis]] and co-written by [[Eric Bress]] and [[J. Mackye Gruber]]. Based on a screenplay by [[Jeffrey Reddick]], it is a sequel to the 2000 film ''[[Final Destination]]'' and the second installment of the ''[[Final Destination (film series)|Final Destination]]'' series.<ref name="Disgusting">{{cite web|last=The Collective|first=Bloody Disgusting|title=Special Feature <U+2018>Final Destination<U+2019>: Not So Final After All!|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/25828/special-feature-final-destination-not-so-final-after-all/|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref> The film stars [[Ali Larter]], [[A.J. Cook]] and [[Michael Landes]]. Larter and [[Tony Todd]] are the only actors to reprise their roles from the first film. Cook portrays a woman who "cheats death" after having a premonition of herself and others perishing in a highway pile-up and uses it by saving herself and a handful of people, but is stalked by Death afterwards by means of claiming back their lives which should have been lost in the highway. It also explores the [[cliffhanger]] of the preceding film by revealing the fates of the previous survivors.

After the financial success of ''Final Destination'', [[New Line Cinema]] contacted Reddick regarding plans for a sequel. Since the original film's crew was unavailable, New Line replaced most of the production team.<ref name="Muze">{{cite web|last=Muze Inc.|first=CD Universe|title=Final Destination 2 Blu-ray

The film received mixed reviews from critics; in which negative assessments sorted the film as "silly and illogical" and "begins with the same flawed premise" of its precursor, while positive evaluations eulogized the film as "a real jolter for horror fans", "recognizes the close relationship between fright and laughter", and "surprisingly good fun for the current crop of horror films".<ref name="Top">{{cite web|last=Flixster|first=Rotten Tomatoes|title=Final Destination 2 - ROTTEN TOMATOES|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/final_destination_2/reviews/?type=top_critics|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref><ref name="Meta">{{cite web|last=CBS Interactive Inc.|first=Metacritic|title=Critic Reviews for Final Destination 2 at Metacritic|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/final-destination-2/critic-reviews|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> The film grossed $46 million domestically and $43 million overseas, earning $90 million internationally.<ref name="Mojo"/> It was nominated for four awards, including the [[Saturn Award]] for [[Saturn Award for Best Horror Film|Best Horror Film]].<ref name="Nominated">{{cite web|last=Movie-Collection|title=Final Destination 2 (2003) - Movie Awards|url=http://www.movie-collection.com/movie/final-destination-2/awards|accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>

==Plot==
One year after the explosion of Flight 180, college student [[Kimberly Corman]] heads to [[Daytona Beach]] with her friends for their [[spring break]]. While driving, Kimberly has a premonition of a pile-up along Route 23, killing everyone involved. Aghast, she stalls her car and prevents lottery winner [[List of Final Destination characters#Evan|Evan Lewis]], widow [[List of Final Destination characters#Nora|Nora Carpenter]] and her son [[List of Final Destination characters#Tim Carpenter|Tim]], businesswoman [[List of Final Destination characters#Kat|Kat Jennings]], stoner [[List of Final Destination characters#Rory|Rory Peters]], pregnant [[List of Final Destination characters#Isabella|Isabella Hudson]], teacher [[List of Final Destination characters#Eugene|Eugene Dix]], and cop [[List of Final Destination characters#Thomas|Thomas Burke]] from entering the highway. While Thomas questions Kimberly, the pile-up occurs and kills her friends [[List of Final Destination characters#Shaina|Shaina]], [[List of Final Destination characters#Dano|Dano]], and [[List of Final Destination characters#Whitman|Frankie]]. 

The survivors are questioned at the police station and informed with the events of the [[Final Destination|previous film]]. They are negligent of [[Death (personification)|Death]] until Evan dies from a fire escape ladder impalement. Desperate for help, Kimberly visits [[Clear Rivers]] ([[Ali Larter]]), the last survivor of Flight 180, inside her psychiatric ward. Though Clear initially refuses to help and invites Kimberly to share her isolation, Clear accompanies Kimberly and Thomas to mortician [[William Bludworth]] ([[Tony Todd]]) after Tim is crushed by a glass pane. Bludworth explains the equilibrium of Death and "new life", implying their salvation upon the birth of Isabella's son. Isabella is taken into custody while the other survivors unite for safety. Overcome by grief, Nora is decapitated by malfunctioning elevator doors. Horrified, Eugene attempts suicide but fails, prompting the group to leave and find Isabella. En route, they discover that their existence lay on the fates of Flight 180's survivors. As Isabella goes into labor, her van nearly collides with the survivors, crashing them onto a farm. In the process, Eugene's abdomen is punctured by [[PVC]] pipes which Kat narrowly avoids. Rory pulls [[List of Final Destination characters#Brian|Brian Gibbons]] from the path of a news van as rescuers arrive at the scene. Their [[Jaws of Life]] activates Kat's airbag, spearing her head within the pipe and dropping her cigarette on a gasoline leak, blasting the news van and trisecting Rory with a [[barbed wire]] fence.

As Kimberly, Clear, and Thomas dash to the hospital, Kimberly has another forewarning of [[List of Final Destination characters#Ellen|Dr. Ellen Kalarjian]] "strangling" Isabella. The trio successfully halt Kalarjian and salvage Isabella; however, Kimberly has another vision of a submerging van and Isabella's embargo from Death all along, denoting that their trial is still at large. Clear searches for Eugene, accidentally detonating his room from oxygen combustion, killing her and Eugene. Kimberly tackles Thomas from the explosion's debris and realizes her premonitions convey her fate. Although Kimberly immerses a van into a lake for Thomas' sake, she is recovered by Thomas and resuscitated by Kalarjian. Afterwards, Thomas and Kimberly have a picnic with Brian's family and Kimberly's father [[List of Final Destination characters#Michael|Michael Corman]] to celebrate their survival. Learning of Brian's deterrence from Death before, the group witnesses a barbecue grill blast Brian, catapulting his burnt arm onto his mother's plate as she screams in horror.

===Development===
''Final Destination'' was conceived by writers [[Jeffrey Reddick]], [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]], and [[Glen Morgan]] from ''Flight 180'', a spec script intended for use in ''[[The X-Files]]''. The film premiered across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] on 17 March 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally.<ref name="OneWeekend">{{cite web|last=IMDb|first=Box Office Mojo|title=Weekend Box Office Results for March 17<U+2013>19, 2000 - Box Office Mojo|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&yr=2000&wknd=11&p=.htm|accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref><ref name="OneInternational">{{cite web|last=IMDb|first=Box Office Mojo|title=Final Destination (2000)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=finaldestination.htm|accessdate=3 February 2010}}</ref> The film's success inspired [[New Line Cinema]] then-President of Production [[Toby Emmerich]] to approach Reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively.<ref name="Disgusting"/> Reddick asserted that he "wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again.<U+201D><ref name="Disgusting"/> Unfortunately, Wong and Morgan weren't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects ''[[The One (2001 film)|The One]]'' and ''[[Willard (2003 film)|Willard]]''.<ref name="Mania">{{cite web|last=Mania|first=Mania:Beyond Entertainment|title=James Wong Talks Movie Projects|work=Mania:Beyond Entertainment|url=http://www.mania.com/james-wong-talks-movie-projects_article_30832.html|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref> Instead, New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator [[David R.

Absent from the cast shot are [[Ali Larter]] as [[Clear Rivers]] and [[David Paetkau]] as [[List of characters in the Final Destination series#Evan|Evan Lewis]].]]

Former ''[[Living Single]]'' star [[T. C. Carson]] was hired as Eugene Dix.<ref name="Cast"/> Carson identified his role as "a very by-the-book type of person but soon has a change of heart as the corpses begin to pile up."<ref name="Culture"/> The crew was enticed of Carson's casting, with Bress mentioning how his "originally envisioned Woody Allen-type of character has got ten more times life than it ever had. It's got ten times the personality, this charisma that T.C. brings to it...he's just such a great presence." Similarly, Perry was astonished by how Carson "can take the most absurd lines and deliver them in such grammatized form with his eyes and his deep rich speaking voice."<ref name="Casting"/> [[Jonathan Cherry]], who recently emerged in the 2003 film ''[[House of the Dead (film)|House of the Dead]]'', was appointed as Rory Peters.<ref name="Cast"/> Cherry characterized Rory as "a very opposite of me whose arc goes from, 'I don't really care at all', to 'Oh my God, this is really happening!'"<ref name="Culture"/> In the script, Bress said that Rory was his favorite character to write since "he's great comic relief, he's got a drug problem, he's funny, and he's all that." Bress bragged that "Cherry is awesome, awesome casting cause he's just so funny and the way he delivers his lines. It's like 'Oh yeah. That's good! That's better!'" "What I think was surprising on him was that from all of the humor he's involved and his sort of itchiness that he has with Kat, there is some moments where he reveals how vulnerable he really is and so the shield comes down and right in there you're really becoming symphatetic to Rory. You like him at first cause he's the funny guy, but then you care about him because you realize that there's a place that humor comes from that we all share," Perry appended.<ref name="Casting"/> 

''[[Blackwoods (film)|Blackwoods]]'' actress [[Keegan Connor Tracy]] played Kat Jennings.<ref name="Cast"/> Tracy claimed that "[Kat] doesn't really buy it at first, but pretty soon even her cynical attitude can't ignore the truth of the situation they're all in."<ref name="Culture"/> Perry defined the role as "someone who is really so self-absorbed that without being overly malicious is incredibly rude and insensitive to the feelings of all those around her." Her casting was assessed by Perry as "full of energy" and "embodies the self-aware nervous energy of Kat. [Tracy] created a character that you kind of dislike intensely but you don't dislike so much that you don't understand why she is the way she is."<ref name="Casting"/><ref name="Disc"/> Rounding up the cast are [[Lynda Boyd]] (Rachel Todd in ''You, Me and the Kids'') as widow Nora Carpenter and [[James Kirk (actor)|James Kirk]] (Kyle Morgan in ''[[Once Upon a Christmas (film)|Once Upon a Christmas]]'') as her son Tim Carpenter, [[David Paetkau]] (Hunter Kerrigan in ''[[Just Deal]]'') as gambler Evan Lewis, [[Justina Machado]] (Vanessa Diaz in ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'') as pregnant Isabella Hudson, and [[Noel Fisher (actor)|Noel Fisher]] (Todd Tolanski of ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'') as farmer Brian Gibbons.<ref name="Cast"/> Novice actors [[Sarah Carter]], Alejandro Rae, and [[Shaun Sipos]] were hired as Kimberly's friends Shaina McKlank, Dano Estevez, and Frankie Whitman correspondingly.<ref name="Cast"/> [[Andrew Airlie]] portrayed Kimberly's father Michael Corman, while Enid-Raye Adams appeared as Dr. Ellen Kalarjian.<ref name="Cast"/>

[[File:OkanaganLake1.jpg|thumb|left|240x180px|[[Okanagan Lake]] replaced [[Greenwood Lake, New York]] in the film for the lake sequence. The scene was shot in two different locations, the other in a private pool in [[Campbell River, British Columbia]].<ref name="Culture"/>]]

===Filming===
Likewise the first film, the film was shot in and around [[Vancouver Island]]. "We know the arena, we know the people up there and let's be honest, there<U+2019>s an enormous economic incentive to shoot there. We were very fortunate to get [unit production manager] Justis Greene, who<U+2019>s been working as a line producer up there for 30 years and who was able to get us the best crew working in town right now. It was advantageous to us on so many levels, that it was just the right place to go for this movie," Perry stated as the reason for the film's production in [[British Columbia]].<ref name="Perry"/> [[British Columbia Highway 19]] was utilized as Route 23.<ref name="Landes"/> The [[Plaza of Nations]] was used as a stand-in for Ellis Medical Complex, the site of Tim's death.<ref name="Tours">{{cite web|last=VancouverSetTours.com|title=Vancouver Filming Locations - Film, TV, City Links, and more|url=http://www.vancouversettours.com/locations.htm|accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref>

The farm and lake scenes were filmed in [[Campbell River, British Columbia|Campbell River]] and [[Okanagan Lake]] respectively, though it is depicted in [[Greenwood Lake, New York]].<ref name="Culture"/><ref name="Vancouver">{{cite web|last=Vancouver.com|title=The Best (and Worst) Movies Filmed in Vancouver|url=http://www.vancouver.com/movies/hollywood_north/vancouver_movies/|accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref> "We shot part of it at the lake where it was 37<U+00B0> cold, which is beyond an ice cream headache. And the second stuff we shot in a big huge tank where we filmed all the underwater sequence, that was in a 93<U+00B0> pool," Landes clarified. Cook and Landes performed their own stunts in both sequences.<ref name="Cook"/><ref name="Landes"/> "My biggest fear is being trapped in a car underwater. So it was kind of cool to face my fear and all that," Cook divulged.<ref name="Cook"/> "We took a couple of lessons with a scuba guide to be comfortable being underwater and breathing off the regulator," Landes enunciated.<ref name="Landes"/>

To avoid confusion with Larter and Carter, Cook was required to dye her hair brown for the role.<ref name="Braun">{{cite web|last=Braun|first=Liz|title=A.J. Cook's career starting to sizzle|work=CANOE -- Jam! Movies|date=31 January|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/C/Cook_AJ/2003/01/31/757391.html|accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> "I like being a chameleon. It opens you up for so much more in this work. You don't get typecast," Cook professed.<ref name="Braun"/> Landes also denied plots regarding Thomas and Kimberly's relationship. "It's kind of a protected relationship, more like a brother/sister thing than a love interest. They didn<U+2019>t want to go there, I guess. They did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn<U+2019>t want it to seem like the cop is like lascivious or something. So what they have now, hopefully, is a little bit of chemistry and you get the idea that through tragedy something good will come. So it ends in an optimistic way, that maybe they can be together but there<U+2019>s no real love story," Landes articulated.<ref name="Landes"/>

===Effects===
Digital Dimension took charge of the [[visual effects]] of the film. CG supervisor Jason Crosby pointed out that their studio was mainly selected for the highway sequence after the crew realized real logs only bounced about an inch off the road when dropped from a logging truck. "They were concerned about how they would make the shot happen, not knowing if CG would work. The timing was great because we had just finished a test shot of our CG logs bouncing on the freeway. We sent a tape to Vancouver and after seeing it the crew was convinced that any of the log shots could be done with CG," Crosby indicated. "It began with R&D on the log dynamics. Scripts were written to help manage the dynamic simulations with real world numbers for gravity, density, etc. The results were remarkably similar to the original logs shot in Vancouver, a testament to the accuracy of the software and the data we had collected, however the logs still lacked the 'jumping through [[windshields]] killer instinct' we were looking for. By tweaking the parameters, we coaxed the logs into a much livelier role." Senior [[technical director]] James Coulter added creative 3D tracking on shots with fast pans, motion blur, and fillers such as dust, mist, slabs of bark, broken chains, and other debris. [[Digital artist]] Edmund Kozin manipulated high resolution photos which were carefully stitched together to achieve realistic texture amongst the 22 CG logs of the film. Hair shaders were also inputed for splintering and frayed wood looks for the logs. [[Physics]] such as speed and height of the logging truck, length and width of the logs, type of wood and density of a [[Douglas-fir]] were also considered.<ref name="CG"/>

In spite of this, there are no CG cars incorporated in the actual film. "It was a possibility in the beginning so we did some dynamics tests using the logs as rigid bodies to hit cars with soft body deformers on them, but when they were done shooting they didn<U+2019>t end up needing any CG cars," Crosby avowed.<ref name="CG"/> Lifecasts of the actors were also used for all of the death scenes, including the highway setting.<ref name="Landes"/><ref name="CG"/> Landes experienced [[claustrophobia]] during the procedure.<ref name="Landes"/> [[Fake blood]] was also used, but CG blood was also shown.<ref name="CG"/>
