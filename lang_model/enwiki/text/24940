The '''Ch<U+00E2>teau de  Larressingle''' is a ruined [[castle]] in the ''[[Communes of France|commune]]'' of [[ Larressingle]] in the [[Gers]] ''[[Departments of France|d<U+00E9>partement]]'' of France.

The castle was built in the second half of the 13th century. The second and third floors were added by Arnaud Orthon de Lomagne, [[Bishop of Condom]], between 1285 and 1305. Windows were added at various times in the 15th and 16th centuries, particularly between 1521 and 1545 when extra works were carried out for Monseigneur de Grossolles, including the construction of a hexagonal tower.

The ruins have been listed since 1922 as a ''[[monument historique]]'' by the [[French Ministry of Culture]].
