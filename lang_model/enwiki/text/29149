'''Florence Smith Jacobsen''' (born April 7, 1913) was the sixth general president of the [[Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) from 1961 to 1972.

==Early years==
Born in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], to [[Willard Richards Smith]] and his wife Florance Grant Smith.  Florence Smith was the granddaughter of two [[President of the Church|LDS Church presidents]]: [[Joseph F. Smith]] and [[Heber J. Grant]]. Smith attended the [[University of Utah]] and graduated in 1934. While at the university she was part of the [[Chi Omega]] sorority. She married Ted Jacobsen in the [[Salt Lake Temple]] in 1935.

==LDS Church activities==
In 1955, Ted Jacobsen was called as the [[Mission president|president]] of the Eastern States [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]] of the church, and the family moved to [[New York City]]. In October 1961, Florence Jacobsen succeeded [[Bertha S. Reeder]] as general president of the church's [[Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association]]. Her aunt, [[Lucy Grant Cannon]], had held the same position from 1937 to 1948. Jacobsen held this position until 1972, when she was released and succeeded by [[Ruth H. Funk]].

During her tenure, the [[Beehive House]] and [[Lion House (Salt Lake City, Utah)|Lion House]]<U+2014>which were operated by the YWMIA<U+2014>were restored and opened to the public. In 1969, the YWMIA celebrated its centennial and in 1971, Jacobsen oversaw the launch of the ''[[New Era (magazine)|New Era]]'', the church's new magazine for youth.

In 1973 church president [[Harold B. Lee]] asked Jacobsen if she would become the LDS Church [[curator]]. Jacobsen accepted and became a key figure in the construction of the [[Museum of Church History and Art]]. As a church curator, Jacobsen supervised the restoration of many church buildings, including the Promised Valley Playhouse in Salt Lake City; the [[E. B. Grandin]] building in [[Palmyra, New York]]; the [[Brigham Young]] home in [[St. George, Utah]]; the [[Jacob Hamblin]] home in [[Santa Clara, Utah]]; the [[Newell K. Whitney]] store in [[Kirtland, Ohio]]; and the interior of the [[Manti Utah Temple]].

On April 21, 2010, Jacobsen was awarded the [[Junius F. Wells Award]] by the [[Mormon Historic Sites Foundation]].<ref name = lloyd/> [[President of the Church|Church President]] [[Thomas S. Monson]] and [[President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] [[Boyd K. Packer]] both spoke of Jacobsen's leadership in preserving historical sites for the LDS Church as well as her leadership in the Young Women organization.  In regards to her leadership of the Young Women organization, Monson stated, "You lifted them to a higher plane, and anyone who's been lifted to a plane of excellence is never again content with mediocrity. That's not a word you have in your vocabulary<U+2014>mediocrity. You've never known it, and you never will."<ref name = lloyd>R. Scott Lloyd, [http://www.ldschurchnews.com/articles/59280/Life-of-building.html "Life of building: Florence S. Jacobsen honored for preserving Church sites"], ''[[Church News]]'', 2010-05-01.</ref>

==Personal life==
Jacobsen and her husband are the parents of three sons.

In 1998, the Jacobsens established the Florence Smith Jacobsen Scholarship at the College of Social Work at the University of Utah. The scholarship is awarded based on "academically based community scholarship and service that focuses on issues of concern to women, with particular emphasis on strengthening families."<ref>[http://www.socwk.utah.edu/students/financialaidscholarships.asp College of Social Work: Financial Aid and Scholarships].</ref>
