'''Gold Coast Airport''', or '''Coolangatta Airport''', {{airport codes|OOL|YBCG}} is an Australian domestic and international airport on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] and is located some {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Brisbane]] and 25&nbsp;km south of Surfers Paradise. The entrance to the airport is situated in the suburb of [[Bilinga, Queensland|Bilinga]] on the Gold Coast. The runway itself straddles 5 suburbs of twin cities across the state border of [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]]. During summer these states are in two different time zones.

Gold Coast Airport is currently the sixth busiest international airport in Australia and the 3rd fastest growing airport in the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Gold Coast Airport|url=http://goldcoastairport.com.au/corporate/about-gold-coast-airport/|publisher=Gold Coast Airport|accessdate=13 April 2011}}</ref>

Until 1999, the airport was known as ''Coolangatta Airport''. It originally consisted (1936) of three grass strips with the intention of only providing emergency landing ground for airmail aircraft transiting between Brisbane and Sydney. Finally, passenger flights took off for the first time in 1939, using the then grassy field of the current [[Coolangatta, Queensland|Coolangatta]] site. Regular services were started by Queensland Airlines and [[Butler Air Transport]] after the Second World War. Ansett started its own services in 1950 using [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3s]], while [[Trans Australia Airlines]] did the same in 1954 using DC-3s too as well as [[Douglas DC-4|DC-4s]] and [[Convair]]s to link other Australian cities.<ref name="goldcoastairport.com.au">{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoastairport.com.au/gcal-history.php |title=About |publisher=Gold Coast Airport |accessdate=30 May 2011}}</ref>

By 1958, the taxiways and runways were fully paved, with the later being upgraded a decade later to allow jet operations with [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|DC-9]] and [[Lockheed L-188 Electra|L-188 Electra]] aircraft to began. The current terminal, entitled ''[[Eric Robinson (Australian politician)|Eric Robinson]] Building'', was officially opened in 1981 by Acting Prime Minister [[Doug Anthony|Douglas Anthony]], when at the time more than 650,000 passengers were using the airport. The following year, the main runway was lengthened to {{convert|2042|m|abbr=on|0}}, thus permitting the use of [[Wide-body aircraft|wide-body jets]] by the two domestic operators [[Ansett Australia]] and Trans Australia Airlines and their [[Boeing 767]] and [[Airbus A300]] respectively on flights from Melbourne and Sydney.<ref name="goldcoastairport.com.au"/>

On 1 January 1988, the airport ownership was transferred from the government to the [[Federal Airports Corporation]]. Its full privatisation occurred a decade later, when it was taken over by [[Queensland Airports Limited]] (QAL) on 29 May 1998. By 1999, the company's name had changed to become Gold Coast Airport Pty Ltd (GCAPL).<ref>

</ref> The airport suffered from the collapse of Ansett in 2001<U+2013> Ansett had operated direct services from the Gold Coast to 12 Australian destinations.

In 2003 GCAPL was taken over by Queensland Airports Limited and today also own and operate [[Mount Isa Airport]] and [[Townsville Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qldairports.com.au/ |title=Queensland Airports Limited |publisher=Qldairports.com.au |accessdate=30 May 2011}}</ref>

Despite the name change from ''Coolangatta Airport'' to ''Gold Coast Airport'' during change of ownership, the airport still carries its original IATA Airport Code, [[List of airports by IATA code: O#OO|OOL]].

In 1990, the airport welcomed its first international charter service from New Zealand, and by 1999, [[Air New Zealand]] [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost]] subsidiary [[Freedom Air]] started scheduled no-frills service from [[Hamilton, New Zealand]] with [[Boeing 737]]s. In 2007, the airport celebrated the arrival of [[AirAsia X]], which began services directly to [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia, and [[Tiger Airways Australia]], which started services to Melbourne. By January 2008, the [[Kuala Lumpur]] route had proved so popular, that all flights up to the month of March were completely booked. AirAsia X announced that they would begin a daily service from 6 February 2010.<ref>{{cite web|author=Name: (will appear on website) |url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2009/10/28/152905_tourism-news.html |title=AirAsia X increases flights to KL Visitor Information |publisher=goldcoast.com.au |date=28 October 2009 |accessdate=30 May 2011}}</ref> 

On 22 September 2008 it was announced that [[Air Pacific]] will expand its services to Australia with the introduction of twice weekly flights between [[Nadi, Fiji|Nadi]], Fiji and the Gold Coast commencing December 2008. Air Pacific<U+2019>s Managing Director and CEO, John Campbell, said "Australia is Fiji's number one source of visitors and with the population growing rapidly in the South East corner of Queensland we know the time is right to introduce this service." The new route commenced on 1 December 2008 with two flights per week operated by 160 seat [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737<U+2013>800]] aircraft on a Monday and Saturday. The service has since been suspended.

By 2009, [[Jetstar]] begun flying at least twice daily to Tokyo and [[Osaka]], Japan. Services to New Zealand increased as well with Jetstar, Air New Zealand and [[Pacific Blue]] flying to [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]] and [[Christchurch]]. [[Airnorth]] also started services to the airport from [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], via [[Mount Isa]]. In addition, [[Virgin Blue]] announced direct services from [[Canberra]] and [[Townsville]]. This opens up connections between all three [[Queensland Airports Limited|QAL]] owned airports <U+2013> [[Mount Isa Airport]], [[Townsville Airport]] and Gold Coast Airport.

2010 saw [[Jetstar]] announce the airport as its newest hub, increased services to [[Cairns]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biztravelguru.com/blogs/airline-hotel-news/archive/2010/08/24/jetstar-increases-flights-to-cairns.aspx |title=Jetstar increases flights to Cairns <U+2013> Airline-Hotel-News |publisher=Biztravelguru.com |accessdate=30 May 2011}}</ref> and new direct services to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Dale Granger |url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/business/news/jetstar-to-slash-prices-and-put-on-18-extra-flights-to-perth/story-e6frg2qu-1225906360674 |title=Jetstar to slash prices and put on 22 extra flights to Perth, Latest Business & Australian Stock market News |publisher=Perth Now |date=17 August 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2011}}</ref> and [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]].<ref>[http://www.aviationrecord.com/SearchResults/tabid/37/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/2724/Jetstar-to-undercut-Queenstown-fares-by-30.aspx ]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref> Tiger Airways also announced their newest base at [[Avalon Airport]] in [[Geelong]], and said that services from Avalon to the Gold Coast will commence later in the year;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tigerairways.com/au/en/real_deals.php |title=Tiger Airways |publisher=Tiger Airways |accessdate=30 May 2011}}</ref> however, services to [[Adelaide]] would be cut due to delays in receiving new aircraft which were meant to be for their new Avalon base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/tiger-cuts-routes-in-profit-review/story-e6frg8zx-1225909107353 |title=Tiger cuts routes in profit review |work=The Australian |date=24 August 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2011}}</ref>

The airport opened an extension to the main runway as well as a full length parallel taxiway in May 2007. The runway will be {{Convert|2500|m|abbr=on|0}} long, allowing for heavier aircraft with greater range to [[takeoff]].<ref>Finelli, Marco: Coolangatta Gold Coast <U+2013> An airport with a golden future, page 55, ([http://www.airlinerworld.com ''Airliner World'' online]) September 2005</ref>
On 16 May 2007, the runway extension was officially inaugurated by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport, the Hon [[Mark Vaile]] MP.<ref>[http://www.ministers.dotars.gov.au/mv/releases/2007/May/075MV_2007.htm Tourism takes off at Gold Coast Airport] ''Minister for Transport and Regional Services'' online</ref>

Gold Coast Airport appointed ADCO Constructions as the principal design and construct contractor for a $100&nbsp;million redevelopment of the airport<U+2019>s main terminal. Completed in 2010, the project has doubled the size of the existing facility to almost {{convert|27000|m2|abbr=on}}, incorporating domestic and international operations with self service kiosks and 40 common user [[check-in]] desks. The works will accommodate forecast growth for the next 10 years with a further expansion, stage two, scheduled to kick in upon demand. The main terminal <U+2013> Terminal 1 <U+2013> currently houses operations for [[Jetstar Airways]], [[Virgin Australia]], [[Air New Zealand]], [[Airnorth]], [[Pacific Blue Airlines]] and [[AirAsia X]]. Terminal 2 accommodates [[Tiger Airways Australia]].

Tiger Airways Australia flights operate from a low cost terminal with basic amenities, located approximately {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} from the main terminal building. The building is loosely similar to [[Melbourne Airport#Terminal 4|Terminal 4]] at [[Melbourne Airport]] but on a much smaller scale.
