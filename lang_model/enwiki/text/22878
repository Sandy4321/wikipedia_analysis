{{Campaignbox Crusades}}
The '''Second Crusade''' (1145&ndash;1149) was the second major [[crusade]] launched from [[Europe]], called in 1145 in response to the fall of the [[County of Edessa]] the previous year. Edessa was the first of the [[Crusader states]] to have been founded during the [[First Crusade]] (1095&ndash;1099), and was the first to fall. The Second Crusade was announced by [[Pope Eugene III]], and was the first of the crusades to be led by European kings, namely [[Louis VII of France]] and [[Conrad III of Germany]], with help from a number of other important European nobles. The armies of the two kings marched separately across Europe and were somewhat hindered by [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Manuel I Comnenus]]; after crossing [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] territory into [[Anatolia]], both armies were separately defeated by the [[Seljuk Turks]]. Louis and Conrad and the remnants of their armies reached [[Jerusalem]] and, in 1148, participated in an ill-advised attack on [[Damascus]]. The crusade in the east was a failure for the crusaders and a great victory for the [[Islam|Muslims]]. It would ultimately lead to the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|fall of Jerusalem]] and the [[Third Crusade]] at the end of the 12th century.  

The only success came outside of the Mediterranean, where Flemish, Frisian, Norman, English, Scottish, and some German crusaders, on the way by ship to the [[Holy Land]], fortuitously stopped and helped the Portuguese in the [[Siege of Lisbon|capture]] of [[Lisbon]] in 1147. Some of them, who had departed earlier, helped capture [[Santar<U+00E9>m, Portugal|Santar<U+00E9>m]] earlier in the same year. Later they also helped to conquer [[Sintra]], [[Almada]], [[Palmela]] and [[Set<U+00FA>bal]], and were allowed to stay in the conquered lands, where they had offspring. Meanwhile, in [[Eastern Europe]], the first of the [[Northern Crusades]] began with the intent of forcibly converting [[Paganism|pagan]] tribes to Christianity, and these crusades would go on for centuries.  

==Background: the fall of Edessa==
{{main|Siege of Edessa}} 
After the [[First Crusade]] and the minor [[Crusade of 1101]] there were three crusader states established in the east: the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], the [[Principality of Antioch]], and the [[County of Edessa]]. A fourth, the [[County of Tripoli]], was established in 1109. Edessa was the most northerly of these, and also the weakest and least populated; as such, it was subject to frequent attacks from the surrounding Muslim states ruled by the [[Ortoqids]], [[Danishmends]], and [[Seljuk Turks]]. Count [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]] and future count [[Joscelin I of Edessa|Joscelin of Courtenay]] were taken captive after their defeat at the [[Battle of Harran]] in 1104. Baldwin and Joscelin were both captured a second time in 1122, and although Edessa recovered somewhat after the [[Battle of Azaz]] in 1125, Joscelin was killed in battle in 1131. His successor [[Joscelin II of Edessa|Joscelin II]] was forced into an alliance with the [[Byzantine Empire]], but in 1143 both the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[John II Comnenus]] and the [[King of Jerusalem]] [[Fulk of Jerusalem|Fulk of Anjou]] died. Joscelin had also quarreled with the Count of Tripoli and the Prince of Antioch, leaving Edessa with no powerful allies. 
Meanwhile, the Seljuk [[Zengi]], [[Atabeg]] of [[Mosul]], had added [[Aleppo]] to his rule in 1128. Aleppo was the key to power in Syria, contested between the rulers of Mosul and [[Damascus]]. Both Zengi and King Baldwin II turned their attention towards Damascus; Baldwin was defeated outside the city in 1129. Damascus, ruled by the [[Burid Dynasty]], later allied with King Fulk when Zengi besieged the city in 1139 and 1140; the alliance was negotiated by the chronicler [[Usamah ibn Munqidh]]. 

In late 1144, Joscelin II allied with the Ortoqids and marched out of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] with almost his entire army to support the Ortoqid [[Kara Aslan]] against Aleppo. Zengi, already seeking to take advantage of Fulk's death in 1143, hurried north to [[Siege of Edessa|besiege Edessa]], which fell to him after a month on [[24 December]] [[1144]]. [[Manasses of Hierges]], [[Philip of Milly]] and others were sent from Jerusalem to assist, but arrived too late. Joscelin II continued to rule the remnants of the county from [[Turbessel]], but little by little the rest of the territory was captured or sold to the Byzantines. Zengi himself was praised throughout Islam as "defender of the faith" and ''al-Malik al-Mansur'', "the victorious king". He did not pursue an attack on the remaining territory of Edessa, or the Principality of Antioch, as was feared. Events in Mosul compelled him to return home, and he once again set his sights on Damascus. However, he was [[assassin]]ated by a slave in 1146 and was succeeded in Aleppo by his son [[Nur ad-Din]].<ref>Durant (1950) p.594.</ref>

===''Quantum praedecessores''===
{{main|Quantum praedecessores}}
The news of the fall of Edessa was brought back to Europe first by pilgrims early in 1145, and then by embassies from Antioch, Jerusalem, and Armenia. Bishop [[Hugh of Jabala]] reported the news to [[Pope Eugene III]], who issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Quantum praedecessores]]'' on [[December 1]] of that year, calling for a second crusade. Hugh also told the Pope of an eastern Christian king, who, it was hoped, would bring relief to the crusader states: this is the first documented mention of [[Prester John]]. Eugene did not control Rome and lived instead at [[Viterbo]], but nevertheless the crusade was meant to be more organized and centrally controlled than the First Crusade: certain preachers would be approved by the pope, the armies would be led by the strongest kings of Europe, and a route would be planned beforehand. The initial response to the new crusade bull was poor, and it in fact had to be reissued when it was clear that Louis VII would be taking part in the expedition.  [[Louis VII of France]] had also been considering a new expedition independently of the Pope, which he announced to his Christmas court at Bourges in 1145. It is debatable whether Louis was planning a crusade of his own or in fact a pilgrimage, as he wanted to fulfil a vow made by his brother Philip to go to the Holy Land, as he had been prevented by death. It is probable that Louis had made this decision independently of hearing about Quantum Praedecessores. In any case, [[Abbot Suger]] and other nobles were not in favour of Louis' plans, as he would potentially be gone from the kingdom for several years. Louis consulted [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], who referred him back to Eugene. Now Louis would have definitely heard about the papal bull, and Eugene enthusiastically supported Louis' crusade. The bull was reissued on [[March 1]], [[1146]], and Eugene authorized Bernard to preach the news throughout France.

==Bernard of Clairvaux ==
The Pope commissioned Bernard to preach  the Second Crusade and granted the same indulgences for it which [[Pope Urban II]] had accorded to the [[First Crusade]].<ref>Bunson (1998) p.130.</ref> A parliament was convoked at [[Vezelay]] in Burgundy in 1146, and Bernard preached before the assembly. [[Louis VII of France]], his wife, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], and the princes and lords present prostrated themselves at the feet of Bernard to receive the pilgrims' cross. Bernard then passed into Germany, and the reported miracles which multiplied almost at his every step undoubtedly contributed to the success of his mission. [[Conrad III of Germany]] and his nephew [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], received the cross from the hand of Bernard.<ref>Riley-Smith (1991) p.48</ref> Pope Eugenius came in person to France to encourage the enterprise. 

For all his overmastering zeal, Bernard was by nature neither a bigot nor a persecutor. As in the First Crusade, the preaching inadvertently led to attacks on [[Jews]]; a fanatical French monk named Rudolf was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the Rhineland, [[Cologne]], [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], and [[Speyer]], with Rudolf claiming Jews were not contributing financially to the rescue of the Holy Land. Bernard, the [[Archbishop of Cologne]] and the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] were vehemently opposed to these attacks, and so Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany to deal with the problem and quiet the mobs. Bernard then found Rudolf in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.<ref>Durant (1950) p.391.</ref>

==Wendish Crusade==
{{Main|Wendish Crusade}}
When the Second Crusade was called, many [[Southern Germany|south Germans]] volunteered to crusade in the [[Holy Land]]. The [[Northern Germany|north German]] Saxons were reluctant. They told St Bernard of their desire to campaign against the Slavs at a [[Reichstag (institution)|Reichstag]] meeting in [[Frankfurt]] on [[13 March]] [[1147]]. Approving of the Saxons' plan, Eugenius issued a [[papal bull]] known as the ''Divina dispensatione'' on [[13 April]]. This bull stated that there was to be no difference between the spiritual rewards of the different crusaders. Those who volunteered to crusade against the Slavs were primarily [[Danes]], [[Saxons]], and [[Poles]],<ref>Davies, p. 362</ref> although there were also some [[Bohemia]]ns.<ref>Herrmann, p. 326</ref> The [[Papal legate]], [[Anselm of Havelberg]],  was placed in overall command. The campaign itself was led by Saxon families such as the [[House of Ascania|Ascanians]], [[House of Wettin|Wettin]], and [[Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein|Schauenburgers]].<ref>Herrmann, p. 328</ref> 
[[Image:Stained glass St Bernard MNMA Cl3273.jpg|150px|thumb|left| St Bernard in stained glass. Upper Rhine, ca. 1450.]]

Upset by German participation in the crusade, the [[Obotrites]]  preemptively invaded Wagria in June 1147, leading to the march of the crusaders in late summer 1147. After expelling the Obodrites from Christian territory, the  crusaders targeted the Obodrite fort at [[Dobin am See|Dobin]] and the [[Liutizian]] fort at [[Demmin]]. The forces attacking Dobin included those of the Danes [[Canute V of Denmark|Canute V]] and [[Sweyn III of Denmark|Sweyn III]], Archbishop [[Adalbert II of Bremen]], and Duke [[Henry the Lion]] of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. When some crusaders advocated ravaging the countryside, others objected by asking, "Is not the land we are devastating our land, and the people we are fighting our people?"<ref>Christiansen, p. 55</ref> The Saxon army under Henry the Lion withdrew after the pagan chief, [[Niklot]], agreed to have Dobin's garrison undergo [[baptism]]. After an unsuccessful siege of Demmin, a contingent of crusaders was diverted by the margraves to attack [[Pomerania]] instead. They reached the already Christian city [[Szczecin|Stettin]], whereupon the crusaders dispersed after meeting with Bishop [[Albert of Pomerania]] and Prince [[Ratibor I of Pomerania]]. According to Bernard of Clairvaux, the goal of the crusade was to battle the pagan Slavs "until such a time as, by God's help, they shall either be converted or deleted".<ref>Christiansen, p. 53</ref> However, the crusade failed to achieve the conversion of most of the Wends. The Saxons achieved largely token conversions at Dobin, as the Slavs resorted to their pagan beliefs once the Christian armies dispersed. Albert of Pomerania explained, "If they had come to strengthen the Christian faith ... they should do so be preaching, not by arms".<ref>Christiansen, p. 54</ref>

By the end of the crusade, the countryside of [[Mecklenburg]] and Pomerania was plundered and depopulated with much bloodshed, especially by the troops of Henry the Lion.<ref>Barraclough, p. 263</ref> This was to help bring about more Christian victories in the future decades. The Slavic inhabitants also lost much of their methods of production, limiting their resistance in the future.<ref>Herrmann, p. 327</ref>

==Reconquista and the fall of Lisbon==
{{main|Siege of Lisbon}}
[[Image:AfonsoI-P.jpg|thumb|Afonso I of Portugal in a non-contemporary portrait. Note the anachronistic [[Plate armour|plate armor]].]]
In the spring of 1147, the Pope authorized the expansion of the crusade into the [[Iberian peninsula]]. He also authorized [[Alfonso VII of Le<U+00F3>n]] to equate his campaigns against the Moors with the rest of the Second Crusade.<ref>Riley-Smith (1991) p.48</ref> In May 1147, the first contingents of crusaders left from [[Dartmouth, Devon| Dartmouth]] in [[England]] for the [[Holy Land]]. Bad weather forced the ships to stop on the Portugese coast, at the northern city of [[Porto]] on [[16 June]] [[1147]]. There they were convinced to meet with [[Afonso I of Portugal|Count Afonso of Portugal]].<ref name="run">Runciman (1952) p.258.</ref> 

The crusaders agreed to help the Count attack Lisbon, with a solemn agreement that offered to them the pillage of the city's goods and the ransom money for expected prisoners. The [[Siege of Lisbon]] lasted from [[1 July]] to [[25 October]] [[1147]] when, after four months, the [[Moorish]] rulers agreed to surrender, primarily due to hunger within the city. Most of the crusaders settled in the newly captured city, but some of them set sail and continued to the Holy Land.<ref name="run" /> 

Elsewhere on the Iberian Peninsula at almost at the same time, Alfonso VII of Le<U+00F3>n, [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]], and others led a mixed army of [[History of Catalonia|Catalan]] and [[France in the Middle Ages|French]] crusaders against the rich port city of [[Almer<U+00ED>a]]. With support from a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]-[[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]] navy, the city was occupied in October 1147.<ref name="p48">Riley-Smith (1991) p.48.</ref>  Ramon Berenger then invaded the lands of the [[Almoravid]] [[taifa]] kingdom of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Murcia]]. In December 1148, he captured [[Tortosa]] after a five-month siege again with the help of French and Genoese crusaders.<ref name="p48" /> The next year, [[Fraga]], [[Lleida]] and [[Mequinenza]] in the confluence of the [[Segre River|Segre]] and [[Ebro]] rivers fell to his army.<ref name="rs126">Riley-Smith (1991) p.126.</ref>

==Crusade in the East==
[[Joscelin II, Count of Edessa|Joscelin]] attempted to take back Edessa following Zengi's murder, but Nur ad-Din defeated him in November of 1146. On [[16 February]] [[1147]] the French crusaders met at [[<U+00C9>tampes]] to discuss their route. The Germans had already decided to travel overland through [[Hungary]], as Roger II was an enemy of Conrad and the sea route was politically impractical. Many of the French nobles distrusted the land route, which would take them through the Byzantine Empire, the reputation of which still suffered from the accounts of the First Crusaders. Nevertheless it was decided to follow Conrad, and to set out on 15 June. Roger II was offended and refused to participate any longer. In France, [[Abbot Suger]] and Count [[William II of Nevers]] were elected as regents while the king would be on crusade. In Germany, further preaching was done by [[Adam of Ebrach]], and [[Otto of Freising]] also took the cross. On 13 March, at [[Frankfurt]], Conrad<U+2019>s son [[Frederick IV, Duke of Swabia|Frederick]] was elected king, under the regency of [[Henry, Archbishop of Mainz]]. The Germans planned to set out at [[Easter]], but did not leave until May.<ref>Runciman (1952) pp.257,259.</ref>

===German route===
The German crusaders, accompanied by the [[papal legate]] and [[cardinal (religion)|cardinal]] [[Theodwin]], intended to meet the French in [[Constantinople]]. [[Ottokar III of Styria]] joined Conrad at [[Vienna]], and Conrad's enemy [[Geza II of Hungary]] allowed them to pass through unharmed. When the German army of 20,000 men arrived in Byzantine territory, Manuel feared they were going to attack him, and Byzantine troops were posted to ensure that there was no trouble. There was a brief skirmish with some of the more unruly Germans near [[Philippopolis]] and in [[Adrianople]], where the Byzantine general Prosouch fought with Conrad<U+2019>s nephew, the future emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick]]. To make things worse, some of the German soldiers were killed in a flood at the beginning of September. On 10 September, however, they arrived at Constantinople, where relations with Manuel were poor and the Germans were convinced to cross into [[Asia Minor]] as quickly as possible. Manuel wanted Conrad to leave some of his troops behind, to assist in defending against attacks from Roger II, who had taken the opportunity to plunder the cities of [[Greece]], but Conrad did not agree, despite being a fellow enemy of Roger.<ref>Runciman (1952) pp.259-267.</ref> In Asia Minor, Conrad decided not to wait for the French, and marched towards [[Iconium]], capital of the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of R<U+00FC>m]]. Conrad split his army into two divisions. The king led one of these, which was almost totaly destroyed by the Seljuks on [[25 October]] [[1147]] at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1147)|second battle of Dorylaeum]].<ref name="res50">Riley-Smith (1991) p.50</ref> 

In battle, the Turks used their typical tactic of pretending to retreat, and then returning to attack the small force of German cavalry which had separated from the main army to chase them. Conrad began a slow retreat back to Constantinople, and his army was harassed daily by the Turks, who attacked stragglers and defeated the rearguard. Even Conrad was wounded in a skirmish with them. The other division, led by the King's half-brother, Bishop Otto of Freising, had marched south to the Mediterranean coast and was similarly defeated early in 1148.<ref>Runciman (1952) pp.267-270.</ref>

===French route===
The French crusaders had departed from [[Metz]] in June 1147, led by Louis, Thierry of Alsace, [[Renaut I of Bar]], [[Amadeus III of Savoy]] and his half-brother [[William V of Montferrat]], William VII of [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], and others, along with armies from [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Brittany]], [[Burgundy]], and [[Aquitaine]]. A force from [[Provence]], led by Alphonse of Toulouse, chose to wait until August, and to cross by sea. At [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], Louis joined with crusaders from [[Normandy]] and England. They followed Conrad<U+2019>s route fairly peacefully, although Louis came into conflict with Geza of Hungary when Geza discovered Louis had allowed an attempted Hungarian usurper to join his army. Relations within Byzantine territory were also poor, and the Lorrainers, who had marched ahead of the rest of the French, also came into conflict with the slower Germans whom they met on the way.<ref>Runciman (1952) 259-263.</ref> 
[[Image:manuelcomnenus.jpg|thumb|left|Fresco of Emperor Manuel I]]

Since the original negotiations between Louis and Manuel, Manuel had broken off his military campaign against the [[Sultanate of R<U+00FC>m]], signing a truce with his enemy Sultan [[Mesud I]]. This was done so that Manuel would be free to concentrate on defending his empire from the Crusaders, who had gained a reputation for theft and treachery since the [[First Crusade]] and were widely suspected of harbouring sinister designs on [[Constantinople]]. Nevertheless, Manuel's relations with the French army were somewhat better than with the Germans, and Louis was entertained lavishly in Constantinople. Some of the French were outraged by Manuel's truce with the Seljuks and called for an alliance with Roger II and an attack on Constantinople, but they were restrained by Louis.<ref>Runciman (1952) pp.268-269.</ref> 

When the armies from Savoy, [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], and [[Montferrat]] joined Louis in Constantinople, having taken the land route through Italy and crossing from [[Brindisi]] to [[Durazzo]], the entire army was shipped across the [[Bosporus]] to [[Asia Minor]]. The Greeks were encouraged by rumours that the Germans had captured [[Iconium]], but Manuel refused to give Louis any Byzantine troops. Byzantium had just been invaded by [[Roger II of Sicily]], and all of Manuel's army was needed in the Balkans. Both the Germans and French therefore entered Asia without any Byzantine assistance, unlike the armies of the First Crusade. In the tradition set by his grandfather [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios I]], Manuel also had the French swear to return to the Empire any territory they captured.<ref>Runciman (1952) p.269</ref> The French met the remnants of Conrad's army at [[Nicaea (city)|Nicaea]], and Conrad joined Louis' force. They followed Otto of Freising's route, moving closer to the Mediterranean coast, and they arrived at [[Ephesus]] in December, where they learned that the Turks were preparing to attack them. Manuel also sent ambassadors complaining about the pillaging and plundering that Louis had done along the way, and there was no guarantee that the Byzantines would assist them against the Turks. Meanwhile Conrad fell sick and returned to Constantinople, where Manuel attended to him personally, and Louis, paying no attention to the warnings of a Turkish attack, marched out from Ephesus with the French and German surviors. The Turks were indeed waiting to attack, but in a small battle outside Ephesus, the French were victorious.<ref>Runciman (1952) pp.270-271.</ref> 

They reached [[Denizli|Laodicea]] early in January 1148, around the same time Otto of Freising<U+2019>s army had been destroyed in the same area.<ref>Riley-Smith (1991) p.51</ref> Resuming the march, the vanguard under Amadeus of Savoy became separated from the rest of the army, and Louis<U+2019> troops were routed by the Turks. Louis himself, according to [[Odo of Deuil]], climbed a rock and was ignored by the Turks, who did not recognize him. The Turks did not bother to attack further and the French marched on to Adalia, continually harassed from afar by the Turks, who had also burned the land to prevent the French from replenishing their food, both for themselves and their horses. Louis no longer wanted to continue by land, and it was decided to gather a fleet at Adalia and sail for Antioch.<ref name="res50" /> After being delayed for a month by storms, most of the promised ships did not arrive at all. Louis and his associates claimed the ships for themselves, while the rest of the army had to resume the long march to Antioch. The army was almost entirely destroyed, either by the Turks or by sickness.<ref>Runciman (1952) pp.272-273.</ref>

===Journey to Jerusalem=== 
[[Image:RaymondOfPoitiersWelcomingLouisVIIinAntioch.JPG|thumb|375px|Raymond of Poitiers welcoming Louis VII in Antioch.]]
Louis eventually arrived in Antioch on 19 March after being delayed by storms,  Amadeus of Savoy had died on [[Cyprus]] along the way. Louis was welcomed by Eleanor<U+2019>s uncle [[Raymond of Antioch|Raymond of Poitiers]]. Raymond expected him to help defend against the Turks and to accompany him on an expedition against Aleppo, but Louis refused, preferring instead to finish his pilgrimage to Jerusalem rather than focus on the military aspect of the crusade.<ref name="brund" /> Eleanor enjoyed her stay, but her uncle wanted her to remain behind and divorce Louis if the king refused to help him. Louis quickly left Antioch for [[County of Tripoli|Tripoli]]. Meanwhile, [[Otto of Freising]] and the remnant of his troops arrived in Jerusalem early in April, and Conrad soon after.<ref>Riley-Smith (1991) pp.49-50.</ref> [[Patriarch Fulk of Jerusalem|Fulk]], [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]], was sent to invite Louis to join them. The fleet that had stopped at Lisbon arrived around this time, as well as the Proven<U+00E7>als who had left Europe under the command of [[Alfonso Jordan]], [[Counts of Toulouse|Count of Toulouse]]. Alphonso himself did not make it to Jerusalem as he died at [[Caesarea]]. He was supposedly poisoned by either by Eleanor of Aquitaine or [[Raymond II of Tripoli]], the nephew who feared his political aspirations in the county. The original focus of the crusade was [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], but the preferred target of [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|King Baldwin III]] and the [[Knights Templar]] was [[Damascus]].<ref name="brund" />

===Council of Acre===
{{main|Council of Acre}}
The nobility of Jerusalem welcomed the arrival of troops from Europe, and it was announced that a council should meet to decide on the best target for the crusaders. This took place on [[24 June]] [[1148]], when the [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem]] met with the recently-arrived crusaders from Europe at Palmarea, near [[Akko|Acre]], a major city of the [[crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. This was the most spectacular meeting of the Cour in its existence.<ref>[[William of Tyre]] wrote "it seems well worth while and quite in harmony with the present history that the names of the nobles who were present at the council...should be recorded here for the benefit of posterity." He lists these and numerous others; "to name each one individually would take far too long." "A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea", trans. E.A. Babcock and A.C. Krey (Columbia University Press, 1943), vol. 2, bk. 17, ch. 1, pp. 184-185.</ref> Notably, no one from Antioch, Tripoli, or the former County of Edessa attended. Both Louis and Conrad were persuaded to attack Damascus.<ref name="rs50">Riley-Smith (1991) p.50.</ref> 

Some of the barons native to Jerusalem pointed out that it would be unwise to attack Damascus, as the [[Burid Dynasty|Burid dynasty]], though Muslim, were their allies against the [[Zengid dynasty]]. Conrad, Louis, and Baldwin insisted, Damascus was a holy city for Christianity. Like Jerusalem and Antioch, it would be a noteworthy prize in the eyes of European Christians. In July their armies assembled at [[Tiberias]] and marched to Damascus, around the [[Sea of Galilee]] by way of [[Banyas]]. There were perhaps 50,000 troops in total.<ref>Runciman (1952) pp. 228-229.</ref>

===Siege of Damascus===
{{main|Siege of Damascus}}
The crusaders decided to attack Damascus from the west, where [[orchard]]s would provide them with a constant food supply.<ref name="rs50">Riley-Smith (1991) p.50.</ref> They arrived at Daraiya on 23 July. The following day, the Muslims were prepared for the attack and constantly attacked the army advancing through the orchards outside Damascus. The defenders had sought help from [[Saif ad-Din Ghazi I]] of [[Aleppo]] and [[Nur ad-Din]] of [[Mosul]], and personally led an attack on the crusader camp. The crusaders were pushed back from the walls into the orchards, where they were prone to ambushes and guerrilla attacks.<ref name="brund">Brundage (1962) pp.115-121.</ref> 

According to [[William of Tyre]], on [[27 July]] the crusaders decided to move to the plain on the eastern side of the city, which was less heavily fortified but had much less food and water.<ref name="rs50" /> It was recorded by some that Unur had bribed the leaders to move to a less defensible position, and that Unur had promised to break off his alliance with Nur ad-Din if the crusaders went home.<ref name="brund" />  Meanwhile Nur ad-Din and Saif ad-Din had by now arrived. With Nur ad-Din in the field it was impossible to return to their better position.<ref name="brund" /> The local crusader lords refused to carry on with the siege, and the three kings had no choice but to abandon the city.<ref name="rs50" /> First Conrad, then the rest of the army, decided to retreat back to Jerusalem on 28 July, though for their entire retreat they were followed by [[Seljukids|Turkish]] archers who constantly harassed them.<ref>Baldwin (1969) p.510.</ref>

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Byzantium1173.JPG|thumb|right|400px|The Mediterranean world after the Second Crusade in 1173.]]
Each of the Christian forces felt betrayed by the other.<ref name="rs50" /> A new plan was made to attack [[Ascalon]] and Conrad took his troops there, but no further help arrived, due to the lack of trust that had resulted from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. After quiting Ascalon, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. Louis remained behind in Jerusalem until 1149. 

Back in Europe, Bernard of Clairvaux was humiliated by the defeat. Bernard considered it his duty to send an apology to the Pope and it is inserted in the second part of his ''Book of Consideration''. There he explains how, with the sins of the crusaders were the cause of their misfortune and failures. When his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether.<ref>Runciman (1952) pp. 232-234 and pg. 277.</ref> He would die in 1153.<ref>Runciman (1952) pp. 232-234 and pg. 277.</ref>

The Wendish Crusade achieved mixed results. While the Saxons affirmed their possession of Wagria and Polabia, pagans retained control of the Obodrite land east of L<U+00FC>beck. The Saxons also received tribute from Chief Niklot, enabled the colonization of the [[Bishopric of Havelberg]], and freed some Danish prisoners. However, the disparate Christian leaders regarded their counterparts with suspicion and accused each other of sabotaging the campaign. In Iberia, the campaigns in Spain, along with the siege of Lisbon, were some of the only Christian victories of the Second Crusade. They are seen as pivotal battles of the wider Reconquista, which would be completed in 1492.<ref name="rs126" />

In the East the situation was much darker for the Christians. In the Holy Land, the Second Crusade had disastrous long-term consequences for Jerusalem. Damascus no longer trusted the crusader kingdom, and the city was handed over to Nur ad-Din in 1154. Baldwin III finally [[Siege of Ascalon|seized Ascalon]] in 1153, which brought [[Egypt]] into the sphere of conflict. Jerusalem was able to make further advances into Egypt, briefly occupying Cairo in the 1160s.<ref>Riley-Smith (1991) p.56.</ref> However, relations with the Byzantine Empire were mixed, and reinforcements from Europe were sparse after the disaster of the Second Crusade. King [[Amalric I]] of Jerusalem allied with the Byzantines and participated in a combined invasion of Egypt in 1169, but the expedition ultimately failed. In 1171, [[Saladin]], nephew of one of Nur ad-Din's generals, was proclaimed Sultan of Egypt, uniting Egypt and Syria and completely surrounding the crusader kingdom. Meanwhile the Byzantine alliance ended with the death of emperor [[Manuel I Comnenus|Manuel I]] in 1180, and in 1187, [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|Jerusalem capitulated]] to Saladin. His forces then spread north to capture all but the capital cities of the Crusader States, precipitating the [[Third Crusade]].<ref>Riley-Smith (1991) p.60.</ref>
