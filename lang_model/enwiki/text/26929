'''''Exosquad''''' is an American [[animated television series]] created by [[Universal Cartoon Studios]] as a [[anime-influenced animation|response]] to Japanese [[anime]].<ref name="SBP_Exo" /><ref name="PD_FAQ"/> The show is set in the beginning of the [[22nd century#Television and film|22nd century]] and covers the [[space warfare in fiction|interplanetary war]] between humanity and [[Neosapien]]s, a fictional race artificially created as workers/[[Slavery|slaves]] for the Terrans. The narration generally follows [[Exofleet#Able Squad|Able Squad]], an elite Terran unit of [[E-frame|mecha]] pilots, on their missions all over the [[Solar System]], although other storylines are also abundant. The series ran for two complete seasons on [[USA Network]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], from [[1993 in television|September 1993]] to [[1994 in television|November 1994]], and was cancelled after one third-season episode had been produced.

== Plot ==
{{see also|q:Exosquad#Opening narration|l1=Opening narration of Exosquad}}
The series is set in the years 2119<U+2013>2121 AD,<ref name="y2119">Dates on the tombstone of [[Exofleet#Nara Burns|Nara Burns]]' parents. {{cite episode|title=Scorched Venus|series=Exosquad|network=[[USA Network]] / [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]|airdate=1993-10-30|season=1|number=8|minutes=14:53|transcript=y |transcripturl=http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/~pdanner/exo/eps/scorched.html}}</ref> several decades after [[human]]ity ("Terrans") has expanded its presence beyond [[Exosquad planets#Earth|Earth]], [[terraforming]] and colonizing [[Exosquad planets#Venus|Venus]] and [[Exosquad planets#Mars|Mars]]. These three planets are "the [[Exosquad planets#Homeworlds|Homeworlds]]", the core first of the Terran interplanetary state and later of [[Neosapien Commonwealth]]. Not all Terrans are affiliated with the Homeworlds, however: the [[Pirate Clans]], descendants of Terran criminals exiled to the [[Exosquad planets#Outer Planets|Outer Planets]] who live off looted Homeworlds' space [[cargo ship|freighters]], are a major independent faction in the show. The first episode opens with the Earth Congress dispatching the entire [[Exofleet]], humanity's [[space navy|space-based military]], to counter the Pirate threat.

With war with the Pirate Clans looming, an uprising begins among the [[Neosapien]]s, an artificial [[humanoid]] race coexisting with Terrans. In the [[back-story]], the Neosapiens were used primarily as slaves during the [[space colonization|colonization]] of Mars and Venus and therefore have been [[genetic engineering|engineered]] to be physically stronger and better adapted to hostile environments than humans. Their mistreatment by Terrans led to the [[Neosapien#Neosapien Revolts|First Neosapien Revolt]] fifty years before the series' begin, which was mercilessly crushed but had brought some positive changes into their lives. Still not content with his fate, the Neosapien Governor of Mars, [[Neosapien Commonwealth#Phaeton|Phaeton]], sets a new insurrection, codenamed "Operation [Neosapien] Destiny", in motion as soon as the Exofleet leaves to chase after the Pirate Clans. The absence of the Exofleet is also a part of Phaeton's plan as it enables the Neosapiens' capture of the Homeworlds without much effort.

The two seasons that the series was on the air follow the progress of the [[Neosapien#Neosapien War|Neosapien War]], as seen through the eyes of [[Exofleet#Able Squad|Able Squad]], an elite [[E-frame]] unit, composed of J.T. Marsh, Nara Burns, Maggie Weston, Kaz Takagi, Alec DeLeon, Rita Torres, Wolf Bronsky, and Marsala (see [[#Cast|Cast]]). Their exploits unfold against the backdrop of the on-going war, as the squad participates in events often crucial to turning its tide. The show features a realistic outlook on war: many characters die in combat, [[military operation]]s are carefully planned and reconnoitered in advance, and [[combat stress reaction|psychological effects of warfare]] are explored. For example, separate episodes detail Exofleet's [[reconnaissance]] of Venus prior to its recapture, the actual liberation, and the repulse of the first Neosapien reconquest attempt. Moreover, even after Venus is retaken by Terrans, several episodes deal with the remaining Venusian [[Homeworlds Resistance|resistance]] and Neosapien forces who hid across Venus, refusing to surrender and awaiting reinforcements. 

The second season draws to a close with the defeat of the Neosapiens and the liberation of Earth, but it ends with a [[cliffhanger]] suggesting that a third season would describe a war against a new [[extraterrestrial life|alien race]], and that the Terrans and the Neosapiens would be forced to ally with each other. However, the series was cancelled soon after the end of the second season so a third season was never made (see [[#Production|Production]]).<br clear="all" />

== Cast ==

{{main|List of Exosquad characters}}
''Exosquad'' features an [[ensemble cast]] that portrays eight members of the Able Squad.

* '''[[Exofleet#J.T. Marsh|Lt. / Lt. Cmdr. J.T. Marsh]]''' (voiced by [[Robby Benson]]), the original leader of the Able Squad, is a responsible and capable officer respected by troopers and superiors alike.
* '''[[Exofleet#Nara Burns|Lt. Nara Burns]]''' ([[Lisa Ann Beley]]) is the least experienced member of the team, whose parents died during the Neosapien assault on Venus. Her relationship with Marsala is a recurring theme in the series. After Marsh's promotion, Burns becomes the new squad leader.
* '''[[Exofleet#Maggie Weston|Lt. Margaret "Maggie" Weston]]''' ([[Teryl Rothery]]) is the field repair specialist of the squad. An introvert and a loner, she has a hidden crush on Alec DeLeon.
* '''[[Exofleet#Rita Torres|Sgt. Rita Torres]]''' ([[Janyse Jaud]]). The second in command of the Able Squad and a perfect soldier, often juxtaposed to Wolf Bronsky. She has a soft spot for children and harbors intense hatred towards the Pirate Clans.
* '''[[Exofleet#Alec DeLeon|Alec DeLeon]]''' ([[John Payne (voice actor)|John Payne]]) is the intelligence and communication specialist. Of [[French people|French]] origin, he is very intelligent and well-educated, making him J.T. Marsh's right-hand man.
* '''[[Exofleet#Wolf Bronsky|Wolf Bronsky]]''' ([[Michael Donovan]]) is the longest serving trooper in the Able Squad, a crack-shot and a slob. Despite his appearance, he has a heart of gold, knowledge of arts and is a very romantic person.
* '''[[Exofleet#Kaz Takagi|Kaz Takagi]]''' ([[Michael Benyaer]]) is the other "[[rookie]]" of the team, besides Nara Burns, who respects all fellow members deeply but often causes them trouble. He especially regards Bronsky as his mentor, with all due consequences to his discipline.
* '''[[Exofleet#Marsala|Marsala]]''' ([[Gary Chalk (actor)|Gary Chalk]]), one of the few Neosapiens serving in the Exofleet, is a complex character, who often makes insightful comments on the situation at hand. Over time, he develops a deep emotional attachment to Nara Burns. Throughout most of the series, he is seen as very stoic, often not getting the punchlines of jokes and remaining calm when provoked.

While the main focus of the show is on the Able Squad, individual episodes and [[story arc]]s are frequently dedicated to other characters as well. For example, the [[Exofleet#Jumptroops|C5 Jumptroop Squadron]], several [[Homeworlds Resistance]] cells, prominent [[Pirate Clans|Pirates]], and high-ranking [[Neosapien Commonwealth#Military|Neosapien officers]] are all given much screen time.

== Themes ==
[[File:Phaeton exosquad.jpg|thumb|left|The Neosapien leader Phaeton was often compared to Adolf Hitler]]
''Exosquad'' had a very serious approach to the plot with several intertwined [[narrative thread]]s and a number of characters displaying a full spectrum of human emotions, relationships and experiences, such as friendship, [[love]], [[hatred]], personal tragedies, [[treachery]] and taking responsibility for others. Michael Edens, the story writer and editor in the second season, credited the show's [[realism (arts)|realism]] for much of its success.<ref name="PD_CCC" /> [[Prejudice]] and [[racism]] are recurring themes in the series,<ref name="evabeast" /> as both Terrans and Neosapiens are shown to harbor hatred and a sense of superiority towards each other. Interplanetary [[politics]] and [[space warfare in fiction|space war]] typical for [[military science fiction]] were presented with an assumption of the fictional [[future history]] of the Solar System up to that point. The Able Squad's duties became more spread out as the second season unfolded, and there were separate story arcs on Mars, Venus, Earth, and in space. [[Espionage]] and intrigue were often featured instead of straightforward battles.

[[Will Meugniot]], the executive producer of the series, once compared anime series ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' and ''Exosquad'' to the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific]] and the [[European Theater]]s of [[World War II]], respectively.<ref name="WM_WW2">{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.anime/msg/34beb481026001eb|author=[[Will Meugniot|Meugniot, Will]]|title=rec.arts.anime entry|publisher=[[Google Groups]]|accessdate=2007-07-18|date=1995-07-08}}</ref> Michael Edens recalled in an interview that the plot was supposed to remind of the Second World War, too, for example with the Neosapien reconquest attempt of Venus, capture of the [[Moon]] and battle for [[Chicago]] paralleling the battles of [[Battle of the Bulge|the Bulge]], [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]], and [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin]], respectively.<ref name="PD_CCC">{{cite web|url=http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/~pdanner/exo/eps/comments.html|author=Danner, Patrick|title=''Exosquad'' Cast and Creator comments|accessdate=2007-08-05|date=2007-03-28}}</ref> The viewers also pointed out parallels between the [[villain]]ous Neosapien leader, Phaeton, and [[Adolf Hitler]] of the [[Third Reich]].<ref name="E2_Phaeton">{{cite web|url=http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1226081|title=Governor General Phaeton|publisher=[[Everything2]]|accessdate=2007-09-22|date=2001-12-31}}</ref><ref name="TVc_NotT">{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/exosquad/episode/111631/trivia.html|title=''Exosquad'': The Night of the Traitor Episode Trivia|publisher=[[TV.com]]|accessdate=2007-09-22|quote={{sic|Exo-squad}} has many similarities with World War II with Phaeton representing Hitler.}}</ref>

The series owes its title to the [[Exo-Frame]]s (commonly referred as ''E-frames''): multi-purpose [[mecha]]-like [[powered exoskeleton]]s mostly utilized as armored combat vehicles or reinforced [[body armour]] by the characters.

== Production ==
[[File:Exosquad - Volume 4.jpg|thumb|The first season was released by Universal on seven [[VHS]] volumes]]

''Exosquad'' was among the first animated series by [[Universal Animation Studios]] (then known as ''Universal Cartoon Studios'') and was created under influence of [[anime]] imported from Japan.<ref name="SBP_Exo" /><ref name="PD_FAQ">{{cite web|url=http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/~pdanner/exo/faq/|author=Danner, Patrick|title=The ''ExoSquad'' FAQ (v. 3.1)|accessdate=2007-07-18|date=2005-08-03|quote=ExoSquad is a cartoon television series created in the US which emulates the Japanese animation (anime) science-fiction epic style.}}</ref> As a result, its complex story line covered a large number of topics from war through romance to genetic engineering and was able to appeal to a broad audience. Although the first season ran for only thirteen episodes in 1993, the rising popularity of the show allowed Universal to make the second one three times as long. In its second season, ''Exosquad'' was put into the "Universal Action Hour" together with ''[[Monster Force]]''.<ref name="toonarific">{{cite web|url=http://www.toonarific.com/show.php?show_id=1170|title=''Exosquad''|publisher=''Toonarific Cartoons''|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>

As the second season progressed, some characters, according to Michael Edens, "took on a life of [their] own": for example, Nara Burns killing Phaeton and the Neosapien [[Neosapien Commonwealth#Thrax|Thrax]] becoming a major recurring character after his initial appearance were not pre-planned.<ref name="PD_CCC" /> Another character, Alec DeLeon, was supposed to perish in the destruction of Mars but the Universal executives strongly opposed it, so he was killed several episodes later, on the Moon, only to be promptly resurrected in a [[Neosapien#Neo Megas|Neo Mega]] body.<ref name="PD_CCC" />

The show was purportedly cancelled after 52 episodes because at that time, many independent production companies were being taken over by larger networks, who wanted to produce their own content. ''Exosquad'' was eventually moved to poor time slots, such as 4 a.m., until the [[audience measurement|ratings]] were no longer sufficient to sustain it.<ref name="cancel">{{cite web|url=http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/~pdanner/exo/faq/show.html#cancel|title=Why was the [''Exosquad''<nowiki>]</nowiki> canceled?|author=Danner, Patrick|accessdate=2007-05-25|date=2005-08-03}}</ref> The final episode detailed the [[post-war]] political and social climate prevalent in the ''Exosquad'' universe, and closed with J.T. Marsh engaging a group of alien space vessels, whose exact nature was to be explained in the third season or a feature movie. Michael Edens later remarked that the staff originally planned the aliens to be [[insectoid]] and that the Pirates' [[Dark matter in fiction|dark matter]], [[Homeworlds Resistance#Albrecht Ketzer|Dr. Ketzer]]'s experiments, and the unactivated clone of Phaeton would have played a great role in fighting them.<ref name="PD_CCC" /> The idea of a movie based on ''Exosquad'' was being promoted by [[executive producer]] Jeff Segal<ref name="cancel" /> and it was also planned to expand the fictional universe with a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, then codenamed ''Exo-Pirates''. Both initiatives were scrapped with the cancellation of the third season.<ref name="PD_CCC" />

== Reception ==
The critical reception of ''Exosquad'' was generally positive, as it was described as "no ordinary cartoon",<ref name="toonarific" /> "truly a superb piece of work",<ref name="techwars" /> "a kind show that [one]<U+2019>ll never forget",<ref name="shamoozal">{{cite web|url=http://www.shamoozal.com/nerdlog/check-those-moves-bronsky-its-exosquad/|title=Check those moves Bronsky, it<U+2019>s ''Exosquad''!|author=Summers, Phil|date=2007-05-02|accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref> and "one of the greatest anime epics ever made".<ref name="evabeast">{{cite web|url=http://reviews.evabeast.com/exosquad.php|title=Reviews: ''Exosquad''|author=Moses, TG|accessdate=2007-10-30|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071122080218/http://reviews.evabeast.com/exosquad.php |archivedate = November 22, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Phil Summers of ''Shamoozal.com'' commented that while "the early [[1990s#Television|90s]] wasn't exactly the best time for cartoons", ''Exosquad'' was "one of the most underrated cartoon series of all time". Summers spoke highly of its "serious, ongoing storyline", complimenting the maturity of raised themes, and denoted the decision to cancel it despite the rising popularity as "weird".<ref name="shamoozal" /> Likewise, Thomas Wheeler of ''MasterCollector.com'' described the abrupt ending as "a VERY frustrating cliff-hanger".<ref name="techwars" /> Both Summers and Wheeler praised the quality of the toy line that accompanied the series.<ref name="techwars" /><ref name="shamoozal" /> TG Moses of ''Evabeast.com'' pointed out that the two main strengths of ''Exosquad'' are its "phenomenal" story and its characters. Like Phil Summers, he complimented the mature themes (such as [[racism]], [[religion]], and [[politics]]), calling the show "thought provoking and inspiring" with "an incredible amount of depth" in it. Moses specifically praised the [[characterization]] of the Neosapien characters, which avoided "absolute [[good and evil]]" designations, and [[voice acting]] in the show, wherein he perceived it "better than everyone else".<ref name="evabeast" /> Both Will Meugniot and Michael Edens commented that ''Exosquad'' was the best show they have worked on.<ref name="SBP_Exo">{{cite web|url=http://www.storyboardpro.com/exosquad/exosquad_landing_01.html|title=''Exosquad'' - The Original American Anime|author=[[Will Meugniot|Meugniot, Will]]|publisher=''StoryboardPro.com''|accessdate=2007-08-09|quote=''Exosquad'' is Will's all time favourite show!}}</ref><ref name="PD_CCC" />

Gord Lacey of ''[[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]'' reviewed the first season upon its DVD release and likewise praised the maturity and complexity of the show, which subverted his expectations. He criticized the occasionally blurry visuals and too quiet audio of the release, rating them both 7/10. Lacey named the absence of DVD extras as a possible source of disappointment for the fans of the show.<ref name="TVSoDVD_S1_rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Exosquad-Season-1/8514|title=''Exosquad'' - Season 1 Review|author=Lacey, Gord|accessdate=2009-05-05|date=2009-04-14|publisher=''TVShowsOnDVD.com''}}</ref>
<!--
A thorough review of the DVD is available on Epinions.com from user: Bigtruckseries. Despite lack of extras and the need to wait for volume 2, the DVD earned a 5 star review. It has also been referenced on episode 16 of the english dub of the japanese anime ''Sgt Frog''.
