"'''Who Really Cares (Featuring the Sound of Insanity)'''" is a song by [[Powderfinger]] from their sixth album ''[[Dream Days at the Hotel Existence]]''. It is the fourth single from the album and is set to be released in Australia in early March [[2008 in music|2008]]. The band's publicist, Ms. Fanclub, announced on [[27 February]] that the single would be released to radioplay in the following week, without specifying a date. In her announcement, she also noted that a music video will be released at about the same time. The music video was then released in mid-March, however the single's release was then announced as [[31 March]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powderfinger.com/site.php#news|date=[[2008-02-27]]|accessdate=2008-02-27 |title=Powderfinger to play the O2 wireless festival!

A music video was released for the song, however it features the live version of the song taken from the [[Across the Great Divide tour (DVD)|DVD]] for the [[Across the Great Divide tour]], whereas the radio single for the song is a radio edit of the studio album version. The music video is directly taken from the DVD, however it is altered optically with filters and converted into black and white.
==Background==
"Who Really Cares (Featuring the Sound of Insanity)" was recorded by Powderfinger for their 2007 album ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'' at [[Sunset Sound Recorders|Sunset Sound Studio]], [[Los Angeles, California]], in early 2007 with producer [[Rob Schnapf]].<ref name=triplej>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/review/album/s1932552.htm|title=Dream Days at the Hotel Existence|work=Music Reviews|publisher=[[Triple J]]|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref> The part of the title "Featuring the Sound of Insanity" refers to a sound just after the bridge in which a [[sitar]] is played with synthesised effects overlaid.<ref>{{cite web|title=Powderfinger Unveil the Sound of Insanity|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s1941510.htm|date=[[2007-06-04]]|accessdate=2008-02-28|work=Triple J Music News|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref> Prior to its release as a single, a live version of "Who Really Cares" appeared on the earlier ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'' single, "[[I Don't Remember]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jbhifionline.com.au/music/id/1070102|title=Powderfinger - I Don't Remember|publisher=jbhifi.com.au|accessdate=2008-03-01}}</ref> Another live version also appears on the group's 2007 DVD ''[[Across the Great Divide tour (DVD)|Across the Great Divide tour]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jbhifionline.com.au/music/id/1107882|title=Powderfinger / Silverchair - Across the Great Divide tour|publisher=jbhifi.com.au|accessdate=2008-03-01}}</ref>

==Release==
===Cover art===
Though the single was never a physical CD release, artwork was created for it. The artwork featured the headless man who is otherwise seen throughout the releases for other singles from ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'', however on this cover, the area where his head would be is a [[fireball]], and he appears to be holding a briefcase while walking down the hallway of a hotel, another common theme throughout the artwork for the album. Unlike the last two singles from ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'', the artwork doesn't follow the picture-in-picture theme. 
=== Music video ===

The music video for "Who Really Cares" is a live performance of the song by Powderfinger for their [[Across the Great Divide tour]] in 2007. The music video contains the performance featured on the [[Across the Great Divide tour (DVD)|DVD for the Across the Great Divide tour]], filmed in Melbourne in 2007. The performance features a piano solo by the pianist Lachlan Doley, who performed keyboards and piano throughout the tour. The music video, produced by PVC as part of the tour DVD, is completely in black and white and throughout features optical filters that warp and alter the visual display. These filters intensify from the bridge and continue until the end of the clip. The music is performed differently to the original studio recording, with improvised solos, including [[Ian Haug]] playing the sitar part on a [[double necked guitar]] with synthecised effects to emulate the sitar sound, and the performance of the song ends with a ritardando, where the tempo slows to an end.<ref>{{youtube|id=Q-8FlaTNNoY|title=Who Really Cares (featuring the sound of insanity)}}, retrieved [[13 March]], [[2008]].</ref>

==Critical response==
Prior to being released as a single, "Who Really Cares" received a mixed response by reviewers when commenting on ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence''. Melbourne based webzine TheScene.com.au reviewer Andrew Weaver comments on the song's musical layering, coupling the song with <U+201C>Wishing on the Same Moon<U+201D> and comments that the layering in the two songs gives the music "genuine depth of sound and taking the veteran group to new places".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thescene.com.au/Music/Features/POWDERFINGER/|title=Powderfinger|author=Weaver, Andrew|date=[[2007-05-23]]|accessdate=2008-02-28|publisher=thescene.com.au}}</ref> CitySearch Sydney also made reference to the likeness to "Wishing on the Same Moon", but notes that what sets the two songs apart is "a serviceable fade-out cacophony of keys and guitar".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sydney.citysearch.com.au/music/viewContent/1119945819575/1137496905646|title=Powderfinger: Dream Days at the Hotel Existence|author=Chavez, Juan-Pablo|date=May 2007|publisher=CitySearch Sydney|accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> Music journalist Chris Leonard of UK magazine ''Rock Louder'' praises the live performance of the song while Powderfinger performed in Glasgow on [[11 December]] [[2007]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklouder.co.uk/articles/4779/Powderfinger---Glasgow-ABC.html|title=Powderfinger - Glasgow ABC|author=Leonard, Chris|date=[[2007-12-11]]|publisher=rocklouder.co.uk|accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> J Watson of ''Fasterlouder.com.au'' comments that the song, when performed live at The Sydney Opera House Forecourt for charity on [[31 October]] [[2007]], was "another highlight of the evening".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/reviews/events/11155/Powderfinger-The-Sydney-Opera-House-Forecourt-311007.htm|title=Powderfinger @ The Sydney Opera House Forecourt (31/10/07)|date=[[2007-11-06]]|author=Watson, J|publisher=fasterlouder.com.au|accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> Fellow reviewer from Fasterlouder, ShahXerxes, comments on the song's "sparse [[Pink Floyd]]-esque sound which echoes through "Who Really Cares", as clever a rock ballad as the band have ever written."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/reviews/music/9282/Powderfinger-Dream-Days-At-The-Hotel-Existence.htm|title=Dream Days at the Hotel Existence|author=Xerxes, Shah|publisher=fasterlouder.com.au|date=[[2007-06-05]]|accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> Andrew Ramadge of ''Mess + Noise'' echoed the comments of similarities to Pink Floyd, and also [[Neil Young]], stating "where psych-gospel organ and wailing guitar billow around Fanning<U+2019>s vocals like a lost track from ''[[Dark Side of the Moon]]''".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.messandnoise.com/releases/5679|title=Dream Days At The Hotel Existence|publisher=Mess + Noise|author=Ramadge, Andrew|date=[[2007-06-10]]|accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref> Though most of the critical response has been positive, the song has also received criticism from UK reviewer Matthias Scherer of ''Noize Makes Enemies''. Scherer notes that the song's title "Who Really Cares" is a question that "should have been asked before recording, not during", though this comment refers both to the song itself, and the whole album of ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noizemakesenemies.co.uk/2007/12/powderfinger-dream-days-at-hotel-of.html|title=Dream Days at the Hotel Existence|publisher=noizemakesenemies.co.uk|author=Scherer, Matthias|date=[[December 2007]]|accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref>
===Charts===
The song's critical response has been mostly positive, though so too were the two prior singles from ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'', which both performed poorly in the charts. Like these two, "Who Really Cares" was released to radioplay and music video stations, but with little inclusion in circulation, leading speculators to believe the single will follow "I Don't Remember" and "Nobody Sees" with poor charting performance. This speculation proved to be accurate, leading to "Who Really Cares" to be the first single by Powderfinger since their 2004 release "[[Bless My Soul]]" to fail to achieve a position on the [[ARIA Charts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Powderfinger|title=australian-charts.com - Discography Powderfinger|work=Songs by Powderfinger|accessdate=2008-04-20|publisher=australian-charts.com}}</ref>
