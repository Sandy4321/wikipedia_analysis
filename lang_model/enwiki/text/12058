==History==
In July 1858, gold was discovered along the [[South Platte River]] in [[Arapahoe County, Kansas Territory]].  This discovery precipitated the [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush]].  Many residents of the mining region felt disconnected from the remote territorial governments of [[Territory of Kansas|Kansas]] and [[Territory of Nebraska|Nebraska]], so they voted to form their own [[Territory of Jefferson]] on October 24, 1859.  The following month, the Jefferson Territorial Legislature organized 12 counties for the new territory including [[Cheyenne County, Jefferson Territory|Cheyenne County]].  Cheyenne County was named for the [[Cheyenne Nation]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] that lived in the area.  Cheyenne County encompassed most of present day Laramie County.  The Jefferson Territory never received federal sanction.

On July 25, 1868, the [[Territory of Wyoming]] was organized.<ref name=WyomingTerritory>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=015/llsl015.db&recNum=211|title=An Act to provide a temporary Government for the Territory of Wyoming|format=[[cgi-bin]]|publisher=[[Fortieth United States Congress]]|date=July 25, 1868|accessdate=2007-11-27}}</ref>  Laramie County was organized in 1867.
