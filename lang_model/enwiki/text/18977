Its khans were the patrilineal descendants of [[Toqa Tem<U+00FC>r]], the thirteenth son of [[Jochi]] and grandson of [[Genghis Khan]]. This khanate was by far the longest-lived of the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[khanate]]s that succeeded the empire of the [[Golden Horde]].<ref>[http://www.allempires.info/article/index.php?q=The_Crimean_Khanate The Tatar Khanate of Crimea]</ref> Having been [[Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire|Vassal of the Ottoman Empire]] since 1478, it was released as a notionally independent state following the Russo-Turkish [[Treaty of K<U+00FC><U+00E7><U+00FC>k Kaynarca]] in 1774 and formally annexed by the Russian Empire in 1783, becoming the [[Taurida Governorate]].

==History==

===Establishment===
The Crimean Khanate was founded when certain clans of the [[Golden Horde]] Empire ceased their nomadic life in the [[Desht-i Kipchak]] (Kypchak [[Steppe]]s of today's [[Ukraine]] and southern Russia) and decided to make Crimea their ''yurt'' (homeland), which at that time had been an [[Raion|ulus]] of the Golden Horde since 1239, with its capital at Qirim ([[Staryi Krym]]). The local separatists invited a [[Genghisid]] contender for the Golden Horde throne, [[Hac<U+0131> I Giray|Hac<U+0131> Giray]], to be their [[Khan (title)|khan]]. Hac<U+0131> Giray accepted their invitation and traveled from exile in [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]. He warred for independence against the Horde from 1420 to 1441, in the end achieving success. But Hac<U+0131> Giray then had to fight off internal rivals before he could ascend the throne of the khanate in 1449, after which he moved its capital to ''Q<U+0131>rq Yer'' (today part of [[Bakhchisaray|Bah<U+00E7>eseray]]).<ref>[http://www.hansaray.org.ua/e_ist_devlet.html Bakhchisaray history] {{en icon}}</ref> The khanate included the [[Crimean Peninsula]] (except the south and southwest coast and ports, controlled by the [[Republic of Genoa]]) and the steppes of modern southern Ukraine and [[Russia]].

===Becoming an Ottoman protectorate===
Hac<U+0131> I Giray's sons contended against each other to succeed him. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] intervened and installed one of them, [[Me<U+00F1>li I Giray]], on the throne. In 1475 the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces, under the command of [[Gedik Ahmet Pasha]], conquered the [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Principality of Theodoro]] and the Genoese colonies at [[Balaklava|Cembalo]], [[Sudak|Soldaia]], and [[Feodosiya|Caffa]] ("Kefe" in Turkic languages). Thenceforth the khanate was a [[protectorate]] of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman sultan enjoyed veto power over the selection of new Crimean khans. The Empire annexed the Crimean coast, but recognized the legitimacy of the khanate rule of the steppes, as the khans were descendants of [[Genghis Khan]].

[[Menli I Giray]], took the imperial title "Sovereign of Two Continents and Khan of Khans of Two Seas."<ref>http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201202/the.palace.and.the.poet.htm</ref>

===Ottoman-Crimean relationship===
[[File:Lucznik tatarski.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A Crimean Tatar cavalry archer.]]
[[File:Szigetvar 1566.jpg|thumb|upright|a [[Persian miniature|Persian ]] style miniature depicting the [[List of campaigns of Suleiman the Magnificent|Ottoman campaign]] in Hungary in 1566, Crimean Tatars as vanguard.]]
In 1475, the Ottomans imprisoned [[Me<U+00F1>li I Giray]] for three years for having resisted the invasion. After returning from captivity in [[Constantinople]], he accepted the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Nevertheless, Ottoman sultans treated the khans more as allies than subjects.<ref>[http://www.hansaray.org.ua/e_ist_bgcs.html Crimean Khans were appointed]</ref> The khans continued to have a foreign policy independent from the Ottomans in the steppes of [[Little Tartary]]. The khans continued to mint coins and use their names in Friday prayers, two important signs of sovereignty. They did not pay tribute to the Ottoman Empire; instead the Ottomans paid them in return for their services of providing skilled outriders and frontline cavalry in their campaigns.<ref>Bennigsen</ref> Later on, Crimea lost power in this relationship as the result of a crisis which took place in 1523, during the reign of Me<U+00F1>li's successor, [[Mehmed I Giray]]. He died that year and beginning with his successor, from 1524 on, Crimean khans were appointed by the Sultan.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The alliance of the Crimean Tatars and the Ottomans was comparable to [[Polish-Lithuanian Union|Polish-Lithuania]] in its importance and durability. The Crimean cavalry became indispensable from the [[Ottomans]]' campaigns in Europe ([[Poland]], [[Hungary]]) and Asia ([[Persian Empire|Persia]]).<ref>[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/russia/milxcrimeantatars.html List of Wars of the Crimean Tatars]</ref>

===Victory over the Golden Horde===
In 1502 [[Me<U+00F1>li I Giray]] defeated the last khan of the [[Great Horde]], which put an end to the Horde's claims on Crimea. The Khanate initially chose as its capital Sala<U+00E7><U+0131>q near the Q<U+0131>rq Yer fortress. Later, the capital was moved a short distance to [[Bakhchysarai|Bah<U+00E7>eseray]], founded in 1532 by [[Sahib I Giray]]. Both Sala<U+00E7><U+0131>q and the Q<U+0131>rq Yer fortress today are part of the expanded city of Bah<U+00E7>eseray.

===Slave trade===
{{see|Crimean-Nogai raids into East Slavic lands}}

The Crimeans frequently mounted raids into the [[Danubian principalities]], [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland-Lithuania]], and [[Muscovy]] to enslave people whom they could capture; for each captive, the khan received a fixed share (sav<U+011F>a) of 10% or 20%. These campaigns by Crimean forces were either ''sefers'', officially declared military operations led by the khans themselves, or ''<U+00E7>apuls'', raids undertaken by groups of noblemen, sometimes illegally because they contravened treaties concluded by the khans with neighbouring rulers. 

For a long time, until the early 18th century, the khanate maintained a massive [[slave trade]] with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East, exporting about 2 million slaves from Russia and Poland-Lithuania over the period 1500<U+2013>1700.<ref>Darjusz Ko<U+0142>odziejczyk, as reported by {{cite web |author=Mikhail Kizilov |title=Slaves, Money Lenders, and Prisoner Guards:The Jews and the Trade in Slaves and Captivesin the Crimean Khanate |url=http://www.academia.edu/3706285/Slaves_Money_Lenders_and_Prisoner_Guards_The_Jews_and_the_Trade_in_Slaves_and_Captives_in_the_Crimean_Khanate |work=The Journal of Jewish Studies|year=2007|page=2}}</ref> Caffa was one of the best known and significant trading ports and slave markets.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 Historical survey > Slave societies]</ref> In 1769 a last major Tatar raid saw the capture of 20,000 Russian and Polish slaves.<ref name="slave trade"/> 

Author and historian [[Brian Glyn Williams]] writes: 
{{quote| Fisher estimates that in the sixteenth century Poland lost around 20,000 individuals a year and that from 1474 to 1694, as many as a million Poles were carried off into Crimean slavery.<ref>{{cite web |author=Brian Glyn Williams |title=The Sultan<U+2019>s Raiders: The Military Role of the Crimean Tatars in the Ottoman Empire |url=http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/Crimean_Tatar_-_complete_report_01.pdf |work=[[The Jamestown Foundation]]|date=2013|page=27}}</ref>}} 

Early modern sources are full of descriptions of sufferings of Christian slaves captured by the Crimean Tatars in the course of their raids: 
{{quote|It seems that the position and everyday conditions of a slave depended largely on his/her owner. Some slaves indeed could spend the rest of their days doing exhausting labor: as the Crimean ''vizir'' (minister) Sefer Gazi Aga mentions in one of his letters, the slaves were often <U+201C>a plough and a scythe<U+201D> of their owners. Most terrible, perhaps, was the fate of those who became [[galley]]-slaves, whose sufferings were poeticized in many Ukrainian ''dumas'' (songs). ... Both female and male slaves were often used for sexual purposes.<ref name="slave trade">{{cite web |author=Mikhail Kizilov |title=Slave Trade in the Early Modern Crimea From the Perspective of Christian, Muslim, and Jewish Sources |url=http://www.academia.edu/2971600/Slave_Trade_in_the_Early_Modern_Crimea_From_the_Perspective_of_Christian_Muslim_and_Jewish_Sources |work=Oxford University}}</ref>}} 

===Alliances===
[[File:J<U+00F3>zef Brandt - Potyczka Kozak<U+00F3>w z Tatarami.jpg|thumb|Tatars fighting [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]]]]
The Crimean Khanate also made alliances with the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the [[Zaporizhian Sich]] and [[Muscovy]]. The assistance of [[<U+0130>sl<U+00E2>m III Giray]] during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] 1648 contributed greatly to the initial momentum of military successes for Cossacks. While relationship with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was also exclusive as the home dynasty of Girays used to seek sanctuary in Lithuania in 15th century before establishing on Crimean peninsula. 

The northern hinterlands of the khanate were coveted by Muscovy for their agricultural productivity, having longer growing seasons than Muscovy itself. Within Muscovy, the permanent warfare at the borderland and the burgeoning in size of the armies of the nobles ([[boyar]]s) fomented intense exploitation of the peasantry.

===Struggle over Astrakhan===
In the middle of the 16th century the Crimean khanate asserted a claim to be the successor to the Golden Horde, which entailed asserting the right of rule over the Tatar khanates of the Caspian-Volga region, particularly the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]]. This claim pitted it against [[Muscovy]] for dominance in the region. A successful campaign of [[Devlet I Giray]] upon the Russian capital, Moscow in 1571 culminated in the [[Fire of Moscow (1571)|burning of Moscow]], and he thereby gained the sobriquet, That-Algan (seizer of the throne).<ref>[http://www.economist.com/cities/printStory.cfm?obj_id=9141603&city_id=MCW Moscow - Historical background]</ref> Just the next year, however, the Crimean Khanate eventually lost access to the Volga once and for all due to its catastrophic defeat in the [[Battle at Molodi]].

The [[Turkish people|Turkish]] traveler writer [[Evliya <U+00C7>elebi]] mentions the impact of [[Cossack]] raids from [[Azak]] upon the territories of the Crimean Khanate, these raids ruined trade routes and severely depopulated many important regions. By the time Evliya <U+00C7>elebi had arrived almost all the towns  he visited were affected by the Cossack raids. In fact, the only place Evliya <U+00C7>elebi considered safe from the Cossacks was the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] fortress at Arabat.<ref>http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=-PFoAAAAMAAJ&q=Evliya+Celebi&dq=qirim+khan+giray&source=gbs_word_cloud_r&cad=5</ref>

The decline of the Crimean Khanate was a consequence of the weakening of the Ottoman empire and a change in the balance of power in Eastern Europe that favoured its neighbours. Crimean Tatars often returned from Ottoman campaigns without booty and Ottoman subsidies were less likely for unsuccessful campaigns. Tatar cavalry without sufficient guns suffered great loss against European and Russian armies with modern equipment . By the late 17th century, [[Tsardom of Russia|Muscovite Russia]] became too strong a power for Crimea to pillage and the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] (1699) outlawed further raids. The era of great slave raids in Russia and Ukraine was over, although brigands and Nogay raiders continued their attacks and Russian hatred of the Khanate did not decrease. These polito-economic losses led in turn to erosion of the khan's support among noble clans, and internal conflicts for power ensued. The Nogays, who provided a significant portion of the Crimean military forces, also took back their support from the khans towards the end of the empire. 

In the first half of 17th century [[Kalmyks]] formed the [[Kalmyk Khanate]] in the Lower Volga and under [[Ayuka Khan]] conducted many military expeditions against the Crimean Khanate and [[Nogays]]. By becoming an important ally and later part of the Russian Empire and taking an oath to protect its southeastern borders, the Kalmyk Khanate took an active part in all Russian war campaigns in 17th and 18th centuries, providing up to 40,000 fully equipped horsemen.   

The united Russian and Ukrainian forces attacked the Khanate during the [[Chigirin Campaigns]] and the [[Crimean Campaigns]]. It was during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1735-1739]] that the Russians, under the command of [[Burkhard Christoph von M<U+00FC>nnich|Field-Marshal M<U+00FC>nnich]], finally managed to penetrate the Crimean Peninsula itself, burning and destroying everything on their way.

More warfare ensued during the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]]. The [[Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774]] resulted in the [[Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji]], which made the Crimean Khanate independent from the Ottoman Empire and aligned it with the [[Russian Empire]].

The rule of the last Crimean khan [[<U+015E>ahin Giray]] was marked with increasing Russian influence and outbursts of violence from the khan administration towards internal opposition. On 8 April 1783, in violation of the treaty (some parts of which had been already violated by Crimeans and Ottomans), Catherine II intervened in the civil war, de facto annexing the whole peninsula as the [[Taurida Governorate]]. In 1787, [[<U+015E>ahin Giray]] took refuge in the Ottoman empire and was eventually executed, on [[Rhodes]], by the Ottoman authorities for betrayal. The royal [[Giray dynasty|Giray]] family survives to this day.

Through the 1792 [[Treaty of Jassy]] (Ia<U+015F>i) the Russian frontier was extended to the [[Dniester River]] and the takeover of Yedisan was complete. The 1812 [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1812|Treaty of Bucharest]] transferred [[Bessarabia]] to [[Russian Empire|Russian]] control.

==Government==
[[File:Zastava.jpg|thumb|left|At the Southern Border of Moscva state by [[Sergey Vasilievich Ivanov]].]]
All Khans were from the [[Giray dynasty|Giray]] clan which traced its origins to [[Genghis Khan]] and asserted its right to rule on this basis. According to the tradition of the steppes, the ruler was legitimate only if he was of Genghisid royal descent (i.e. "ak s<U+00FC>yek"). Even the Muscovite Tsar claimed Genghisid descent.<ref>Schamiloglu</ref> Although the Giray dynasty was the symbol of government, the khan actually governed with the participation of [[Qarachi|Qara<U+00E7><U+0131>]] [[Bey]]s, the leaders of the noble clans such as <U+015E>irin, Bar<U+0131>n, Ar<U+011F><U+0131>n, Q<U+0131>p<U+00E7>aq, and in the later period, Mansuro<U+011F>lu and Sicavut. After the collapse of the [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in 1556, an important element of the Crimean Khanate were the [[Nogays]], who most of them transferred their allegiance from Astrakhan to Crimea. [[Circassians]] (Atteghei) and [[Cossacks]] also occasionally played roles in Crimean politics, alternating their allegiance between the khan and the beys.  
The [[Nogais|Nogay]] pastoral nomads north of the [[Black Sea]] were nominally subject to the Crimean Khan. They were divided into the following groups: [[Budjak]] (from the Danube to the Dniester), [[Yedisan]] (from the Dniester to the Bug), Jamboyluk (Bug to Crimea), Yedickul (north of Crimea) and [[Kuban]].

===Internal affairs===
[[File:<U+041A><U+0430><U+0440><U+043B><U+043E> <U+0411><U+043E><U+0441><U+0441><U+043E><U+043B><U+0438>. <U+0425><U+0430><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0434><U+0432><U+043E><U+0440><U+0435><U+0446>.jpg|thumb|Khan Qirim Girai, is known to have authorized the construction of many landmarks in [[Bakhchysarai]] and the Crimean Khanate.]]

Internally, the khanate territory was divided among the beys, and beneath the beys were [[mirza]]s from noble families. The relationship of peasants or herdsmen to their mirzas was not [[feudal]]. They were free and the [[Sharia|Islamic law]] protected them from losing their rights. Apportioned by village, the land was worked in common and taxes were assigned to the whole village. The tax was one tenth of an agricultural product, one twentieth of a herd animal, and a variable amount of unpaid labor. During the reforms by the last khan [[<U+015E>ahin Giray]], the internal structure was changed following the Turkish pattern: the nobles' landholdings were proclaimed the domain of the khan and reorganized into ''qad<U+0131>l<U+0131>qs'' (provinces governed by representatives of the khan).

===Crimean law===
[[File:Mengli bayezid.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Me<U+00F1>li I Giray]] at the court of Ottoman sultan [[Bayezid II]]]]
Crimean law was based on Tatar law, Islamic law, and, in limited matters, [[Ottoman Law|Ottoman law]]. The leader of the Muslim establishment was the [[mufti]], who was selected from among the local Muslim clergy. His major duty was neither judicial nor theological, but financial. The mufti<U+2019>s administration controlled all of the [[vakif]] lands and their enormous revenues. Another Muslim official, appointed not by the clergy but the Ottoman sultan, was the [[kad<U+0131>asker]], the overseer of the khanate<U+2019>s judicial districts, each under jurisdiction of a [[Kad<U+0131>|kadi]]. In theory, kadis answered to the kadiaskers, but in practice they answered to the clan leaders and the khan. The kadis determined the day to day legal behavior of Muslims in the khanate.

===Non-Muslim minorities===

Crimea had important trading ports where the goods arrived via the [[Silk Road]] were exported to the Ottoman Empire and Europe.

Crimea was a center of wine, tobacco, and fruit cultivation. Bah<U+00E7>eseray [[kilim]]s ([[oriental rug]]s) were exported to [[Poland]], and knives made by Crimean Tatar artisans were deemed the best by the Caucasian tribes. Crimea was also renowned for manufacture of silk and honey. 

The [[slave trade]] (15th-17th century) in captured Ukrainians and Russians was one of the major sources of income of Crimean Tatar and Nogay nobility. In this process, known as ''harvesting the steppe'', raiding parties would go out and capture, and then enslave the local Christian peasants living in the countryside.<ref>Williams</ref> In spite of the dangers, Polish and Russian [[serfs]] were attracted to the freedom offered by the empty steppes of [[Ukraine]]. The slave raids entered Russian and Cossack folklore and many ''[[Duma (epic)|dumy]]'' were written elegising the victims' fates. This contributed to a hatred for the Khanate that transcended political or military concerns. But in fact, there were always small raids committed by both Tatars and [[Cossacks]], in both directions.<ref name="ReferenceA">The Russian Annexation of the Crimea 1772-1783, page 26</ref>

The [[Selim II Giray]] fountain, built in 1747, is considered one of the masterpieces of Crimean Khanate's hydraulic engineering designs and is still marveled in modern times. It consists of small [[ceramic]] pipes, boxed in an underground stone tunnel, stretching back to the spring source more than 200 meters away. It was one of the finest sources of water in [[Bakhchisaray]].

===Bakhchisaray Fountain===
[[image:Hansaray Fountain Tears 1.jpg|thumb|Fountain of Tears is one of the most notable forms of Crimean art.]]

One of the notable constructors of Crimean art and architecture was, [[Q<U+0131>r<U+0131>m Giray]], who in 1764 commissioned the fountain master Omer the Persian to construct the Bakhchisaray Fountain. The Bakhchisaray Fountain or ''Fountain of Tears'' is a real case of life imitating art. The fountain is known as the embodiment of love of one of the last Crimean Khans, Khan Q<U+0131>r<U+0131>m Giray for his young wife, and his grief after her early death. The Khan was said to have fallen in love with a [[Poles|Polish]] girl in his [[harem]]. Despite his battle-hardened harshness, he was grievous and wept when she died, astonishing all those who knew him. He commissioned a marble fountain to be made, so that the rock would weep, like him, forever.<ref>Johnstone, Sarah. ''Ukraine''. Lonely Planet, 2005. ISBN 1-86450-336-X</ref>

==Regions and administration==
;Main regions outside of ''Qirim yurt'' (the peninsula)
*Kaztsiv ulus (located in [[Kuban]])
*Yedychkul Horde
*Djambayluk Horde
*[[Yedisan|Yedisan Horde]]
*[[Budjak|Budjak Horde]] (?)
*Prohnoinsk Palanka (possibly leased to the Zaporizhian Host) (located on the Kinburn peninsula)
*[[Silistra Province, Ottoman Empire]] for sometime governed by [[Bakhchisaray]]

The peninsula itself was divided by the khan's family and several ''beys''. The estates controlled by beys were called ''beylik''. Beys in the khanate were as important as the Polish ''[[Magnat]]s''. Directly to the khan belonged [[Cufut-Qale]], [[Bakhchisaray]], and [[Staryi Krym]] (Eski Qirim). The khan also possessed all the salt lakes and the villages around them, as well as the woods around the rivers [[Alma River (Ukraine)|Alma]], Kacha, and [[Salhir River|Salgir]]. Part of his own estate included the wastelands with their newly created settlements.

Part of the main khan's estates were the lands of the ''Kalha-sultan'' (Qal<U+011F>a) who was next in the line of succession of the khan's family. He usually administered the eastern portion of the peninsula. Kalha also was Chief Commander of the Crimean Army in the absence of the Khan. The next hereditary administrative position, called ''Nureddin,'' was also assigned to the khan's family. He administrated the western region of the peninsula. There also was a specifically assigned position for the khan's mother or sister &mdash; ''Ana-beim'' &mdash; which was similar to the Ottomans' [[Valide Sultan]]. The senior wife of the Khan carried a rank of ''Ulu-beim'' and was next in importance to the Nureddin.

By the end of the khanate regional offices of the ''kaimakans'', who administered smaller regions of the Crimean Khanate, were created.

*[[Perekop|Or Qap<U+0131>]] (Perekop) had special status. The fortress was controlled either directly by the khan's family or by the family of Shirin.

===Ottoman Empire territories===
*[[Kefe Eyalet]], a seat of Ottomans in Crimea until 1774
*[[Silistra Eyalet]], the western coast of Black Sea, later [[Danube Vilayet]]
