'''Kenilworth Castle''' is a [[castle]] located in [[Kenilworth]], [[Warwickshire]], England. Kenilworth Castle is notable for the quality of its architecture, with phases of building from [[Norman conquest of England|Norman]] through to [[Tudor period|Tudor]] times, and has been described by architectural historian Anthony Emery as "the finest surviving example of a semi-royal palace of the later middle ages, significant for its scale, form and quality of workmanship".<ref name=Emery2000P402/> Kenilworth has also played an important historical role, including in the [[Siege of Kenilworth]] in 1266, believed to be the longest siege in English history; the removal of [[King Edward II of England|Edward II]] from the English throne; the French insult to [[King Henry V of England|Henry V]] in 1414, said by [[John Strecche]] to have encouraged the [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] campaign; as a base for [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] operations in the [[War of the Roses]] and the [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]]'s lavish reception of [[Queen Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1575.

Kenilworth Castle was built over several centuries. Founded in the 1120s around a powerful [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[keep|great tower]], the castle was significantly enlarged by [[King John I of England|King John]] at the beginning of the 13th century. Huge water defences were created by damming the local streams and the resulting fortifications proved able to withstand assaults by land and water in 1266. [[John of Gaunt]] spent lavishly in the late 14th century, turning the medieval castle into a palace fortress designed in the latest [[Perpendicular Period#Perpendicular Gothic|perpendicular style]]. The Earl of Leicester then expanded the castle once again, constructing new [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] buildings and exploiting the medieval heritage of Kenilworth to produce a fashionable [[Renaissance]] palace. 

Kenilworth was [[slighting|slighted]] by Parliamentary forces in 1649 to prevent it being used as a military stronghold. Ruined, only two of its buildings remain habitable today. The castle became a tourist destination from the 18th century onwards, becoming famous in the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] period following the publishing of Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s novel ''[[Kenilworth (novel)|Kenilworth]]'' in 1826. [[English Heritage]] has managed the castle since 1984. The castle is classed as a Grade I [[listed building]] and as a [[Scheduled Monument]], and is open to the public.

Although now ruined as a result of the [[slighting]], or deliberate partial destruction, of the castle after the [[English Civil War]], Kenilworth illustrates five centuries of English military and civil architecture. The castle is built almost entirely from local [[New Red Sandstone]].<ref>Emery 2000, p.340.</ref>

===Entrance and outer bailey wall===

To the south-east of the main castle lie the Brays, a corruption of the French word ''braie'', meaning an external fortification with [[palisades]].<ref>Morris 2010, p.5.</ref> Only earthworks and fragments of masonry remain of what was an extensive 13th century [[barbican]] structure including a stone wall and an external [[gatehouse]] guarding the main entrance route to the castle.<ref name=PettiferP258>Pettifer, p.258.</ref> The area now forms part of the car park for the castle. Beyond the Brays are the ruins of the Gallery Tower, a second gatehouse remodelled in the 15th century. The Gallery Tower originally guarded the 125-metre (410-ft) long, narrow walled causeway that still runs from the Brays to the main castle. This causeway was called the Tiltyard, as it was used for tilting, or [[jousting]], in medieval times. The Tiltyard causeway acted both as a dam and as part of the [[barbican]] defences.<ref name=PettiferP258/> To the east of the Tiltyard is a lower area of marshy ground, originally flooded and called the Lower Pool, and to the west an area once called the [[Mere (lake)|Great Mere]]. The Great Mere is now drained and forms a [[meadow]], but would originally have been a large lake covering around a hundred acres (4,400,000 sq ft), dammed by the Tiltyard causeway.<ref>Hull 2009, p.49.</ref>

The outer [[bailey]] of Kenilworth castle is usually entered through Mortimer's Tower, today a modest ruin but originally a Norman stone gatehouse, extended in the late 13th and 16th centuries.<ref name=PettiferP258/> The outer bailey wall, long and relatively low, was mainly built by [[King John I of England|King John]]; it has numerous buttresses but only a few towers, being designed to be primarily defended by the water system of the Great Mere and Lower Pool.<ref name=PettiferP258/> The north side of the outer bailey wall is almost entirely destroyed, due to the slighting.<ref name=PettiferP258/> Moving clockwise around the outer bailey, the defences includes a watergate, which would originally have led onto the Great Mere; the King's gate, a late 17th century agricultural addition; the Swan Tower, a late 13th century tower with 16th century additions named after the swans that lived on the Great Mere; the early 13th century Lunn's Tower, and the 14th century Water Tower, so named because it overlooked the Lower Pool.<ref>Pettifer, p.258; Morris 2010, p.24, 29.</ref>

===Inner court===

Kenilworth's inner court consists of a number of buildings set against a [[bailey]] wall, originally of Norman origin, exploiting the defensive value of a natural [[knoll]] that rises up steeply from the surrounding area.<ref>Pettifer, pp.257-8.</ref> The 12th-century [[keep|great tower]] occupies the knoll itself and forms the north-east corner of the bailey. Ruined during the slighting, the great tower is notable for its huge corner turrets, essentially hugely exaggerated Norman [[pilaster]] [[buttresses]].<ref>Thompson, p.77; Pettifer, p.258.</ref> Its walls are 5-metres (17-ft) thick, and the towers 30-metres (100-ft) high.<ref>Hull, 2009, p.102.</ref> Although Kenilworth's great tower is larger, it is similar to that of [[Brandon Castle]] near [[Coventry]], also built by the Clintons in the 1120s.<ref name=Morris2010P37>Morris 2010, p.37.</ref> The tower can be termed a hall keep, as it is longer than it is wide.<ref name=PettiferP258/> The lowest floor is filled with earth, possibly taken from the earlier motte that may have been present on the site, and is further protected by a sloping stone [[plinth]] around the base.<ref>Thompson, p.77; Pettifer, p.258.</ref> The tall Tudor windows at the top of the tower date from the 1570s.<ref>Morris 2010, p.8.</ref>

Much of the northern part of the inner bailey was built by the 14th-century noble [[John of Gaunt]] between 1372<U+2013>80.<ref name=Emery2000P402>Emery 2000, p.402.</ref> This part of the castle is considered by historian Anthony Emery to be "the finest surviving example of a semi-royal palace of the later middle ages, significant for its scale, form and quality of workmanship".<ref name=Emery2000P402/> Gaunt's architectural style emphasised rectangular design, the separation of ground floor service areas from the upper stories and a contrast of austere exteriors with lavish interiors, especially on the 1st floor.<ref>Emery, pp205-6.</ref> The result is considered "an early example of the [[Perpendicular Period#Perpendicular Gothic|perpendicular style]]".<ref name=StokstadP77>Stokstad, p.77.</ref>

[[Image:Kenilworth Castle - Great Hall.jpg|right|thumb|300px|John of Gaunt's great hall, showing the vertical lines characteristic of the [[Perpendicular Period#Perpendicular Gothic|perpendicular style]].]]
The most significant of Gaunt's buildings is his great hall. The great hall replaced an earlier sequence of great halls on the same site, and was heavily influenced by [[King Edward III of England|Edward III]]'s design at [[Windsor Castle]].<ref>Emery, p.205; Thompson 1977, pp211-8.</ref>  The hall consists of a "ceremonial sequence of rooms", approached by a particuarly grand staircase, now lost.<ref>Emery, p.246; Pettifer, p.258</ref> From the great hall, visitors could look out to admire the Great Mere or the inner court through huge windows.<ref>Stokstad, p.78; Pettifer, p.258.</ref> The [[undercroft]] to the hall, used by the service staff, was lit with slits, similar to design at the contemporary [[Wingfield Manor]].<ref name=Emery2000P402/> The roof was built in 1376 by William Wintringham, producing the widest hall, unsupported by pillars, existing in England at the time.<ref name=EmeryEmeryP543>Emery, p.543; Emery 2000, p.401, 404.</ref> There is some debate amongst historians as to whether this roof was a [[hammerbeam roof|hammerbeam design]], a collar and truss-brace design, or a combination of the two.<ref name=EmeryEmeryP543/>

There was an early attempt at symmetry in the external appearance of the great hall&nbsp;<U+2013> the Strong and Saintlowe Towers architecturally act as near symmetrical "wings" to the hall itself, whilst the plinth of the hall is designed to mirror that of the great tower opposite it.<ref>Emery 2000, p.340, 403; Morris 2010, p.13.</ref> An unusual multi-sided tower, the Oriel, provides a counterpoint to the main doorway of the hall and was intended for private entertainment by Gaunt away from the main festivities on major occasions.<ref>Hull 2009, p.118.</ref> The Oriel tower is based on Edward III's "La Rose" Tower at Windsor, which had a similar function.<ref>Morris 2010, p.17.</ref> Gaunt's Strong Tower is so named for being entirely [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] in stone across all its floors, an unusual and robust design.<ref>Morris 2010, p.12.</ref> The great hall influenced the design of [[Bolton Castle|Bolton]] and [[Raby Castle|Raby castles]], whilst the hall's roof design became famous and was copied at [[Arundel Castle]] and [[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Westminster Hall]].<ref>Emery, p.205, 543.</ref>

Other parts of the castle built by Gaunt include the southern range of state appartments, Gaunt's Tower and the main kitchen.<ref name=StokstadP77/> Although now extensively damaged, these share the same style as the great hall; this would have unified the appearance of Gaunt's palace in a distinct break from the more eclectic medieval tradition of design.<ref>Stokstad, pp77-8.</ref> Gaunt's kitchen replaced the original 12th-century kitchens, built alongside the great tower in a similar to the arrangement at [[Conisbrough Castle|Conisbrough]].<ref>Thompson, p.77.</ref> Gaunt's new kitchen was twice the size of that in equivalent  castles, measuring nineteen metres (66 ft) by eight metres (28 ft).<ref>Morris 2010, p.11.</ref>

The remainder of the inner court was built by [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester]] in the 1570s. He built a tower now known as Leicester's building on the south edge of the court as a guest wing, extending out beyond the inner bailey wall for extra space.<ref>Morris 2010, p.19.</ref> Leicester's building was four floors high and built in a fashionable contemporary Tudor style with "brittle, thin walls and grids of windows".<ref>Morris 2010, p.19, 48.</ref> The building was intended to juxtapose with the ancient great tower, one of the reasons for its considerable height.<ref name=Morris2010P48>Morris 2010, p.48.</ref> Leicester's building set the style for later Elizabeth country house design, especially in the Midlands, with [[Hardwick Hall]] being a classic example.<ref>Johnson 2000, p.234; Morris 2010, p.48.</ref>

Leicester also built a [[loggia]], or open gallery, beside the great keep to lead to the new formal gardens.<ref name=StokstadP80>Stokstad, p.80.</ref> The loggia was designed to elegantly frame the view as the observer slowly admired the gardens, and was a very new design in 16th century, only recently imported from Italy.<ref name=StokstadP80/>

===Base, left-hand and right-hand courts===

[[Image:Kenilworth Castle4.jpg|thumb|right|Leicester's gatehouse, built by [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] in a deliberately anachronistic style.]]
The rest of Kenilworth castle's interior is divided into three areas, the base court, stretching between Mortimer's Tower and Leicester's gatehouse; the left-hand court, stretching south-west around the outside of the inner court, and the right-hand court, to the north-west of the inner court.<ref name=Morris2010P6>Morris 2010, p.6.</ref> The line of trees planted that cuts across the base court today is a relatively modern mid-19th century addition and originally this court would have been more open, save for the collegiate chapel that once stood in front of the stables.<ref name=Morris2010P6/> Destroyed in 1524, only the chapel's foundations remain.<ref>Morris 2010, p.29.</ref> Each of the courts was designed to be used for different purposes: the base court was considered a relatively public area, with the left and right courts used for more private occasions.<ref>Morris 2010, p.24.</ref> 

Leicester's gatehouse was built on the north side of the base court, replacing an older gatehouse to provide a fashionable entrance from the direction of [[Coventry]].<ref>Morris 2010, p.26.</ref> The external design, with its symbolic towers and, originally, battlements, echoes a style popular a century or more before, closely resembling [[Kirby Muxloe Castle|Kirby Muxloe]] and the Beauchamp gatehouse at [[Warwick Castle]].<ref>Johnson 2000, p.233; Morris 2010, p.26, 47.</ref> By contrast the interior, with its contemporary wood panelling, is in the same, highly contemporary Elizabethan fashion of Leicester's building in the inner court.<ref>Johnson 2000, p.233.</ref> Leicester's gatehouse is one of the few parts of the castle to remain intact. The stables built by [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|John Dudley]] in the 1550s also survive and lie along the east side of the base court.<ref>Morris 2010, p.28.</ref> The stable block is a large building built mostly in stone, but with a timber framed, decoratively panelled first-storey designed in an anachronistic, vernacular style.<ref>Morris 2010, p.28; Johnson 2000, p.224.</ref> Both buildings could have easily been seen from Leicester's building and were therefore on permanent display to visitors.<ref name=JohnsonStokstadP226/> Leciester's intent may have been to create a deliberately anachronistic view across the base court, echoing the older ideals of chivalry and romance alongside the more modern aspects of the redesign of the castle.<ref name=JohnsonStokstadP226>Johnson 2000, p.226; Stokstad, p.80.</ref>

===Garden and Landscape===

[[File:KenilworthCastleGardens1.JPG|thumb|right|The restored Elizabethan [[knot garden]]s, designed to reproduce the appearance of the gardens in 1575.]]

Much of the right-hand court of Kenilworth castle is occupied by the castle garden. For most of Kenilworth's history the role of the castle garden, used for entertainment, would have been very distinct from that of the surrounding chase, used primarily for hunting.<ref>Colvin, p.12.</ref> From the 16th century onwards there were elaborate [[knot garden]]s in the base court.<ref>Hull 2006, p.114.</ref> The gardens today are designed to reproduce as closely as possible the primarily historical record of their original appearance in 1575, with a steep terrace along the south side of the gardens and steps leading down to eight square knot gardens.<ref>Morris 2010, pp32-3; Greene and Moore, p.298.</ref> In Elizabethan gardens "the plants were almost incidental", and instead the design focus was on sculptures, including four wooden obelisks painted to resemble [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] and a marble fountain with a statue of two athlants, [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological figures]].<ref>Morris 2010, pp32-3.</ref> A timber [[aviary]] contains a range of birds.<ref>Morris 2010, p.33.</ref> The original garden was heavily influenced by the [[Italian Renaissance garden]] at [[Villa d'Este]].<ref>Morris 2010, p.34.</ref>

To the north-west of the castle are earthworks marking the spot of the "Pleasance", created in 1414 by [[King Henry V of England|Henry V]].<ref name=HullColvinEmery2000P114/> The Pleasance was a banqueting house built in the style of a miniature castle.<ref name=HullColvinEmery2000P114/> Surrounded by two diamond shaped [[moat]]s with its own dock, the Pleasance was positioned on the far side of the Great Mere and had to be reached by boat.<ref name=HullColvinEmery2000P114>Hull 2006, p.114; Colvin, p.11; Emery 2000, p.404.</ref> It resembled [[King Richard II of England|Richard II]]'s retreat at [[Richmond, London|Sheen]] from the 1380s, and was later copied by his younger brother, Duke Humphrey of Gloucester, at [[Greenwich Palace|Greenwich]] in the 1430s, as well by his son, [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|John of Lancaster]] at [[Fulbrook, Warwickshire|Fulbrook]].<ref>Colvin, p.11; Emery 2000, p.340.</ref>  The Pleasance was eventually dismantled by [[King Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and partially moved into the left-hand court inside the castle itself, possibly to add to the anachronistic appearance.<ref>Johnson 2000, p.233.</ref>

==History==


===12th century===
[[File:Kenilworth Castle keep, 2008.jpg|thumb|right|The [[keep|great tower]] is one of Kenilworth Castle's earliest surviving structures.]]
Kenilworth Castle was founded in the early 1120s by [[Geoffrey de Clinton]], Lord Chamberlain to [[King Henry I of England|Henry I]].<ref name=PettiferP257>Pettifer, p.257.</ref> The castle's original form is uncertain; it has been suggested that it consisted of a [[motte-and-bailey|motte]], an earthen mound surmounted by wooden buildings, however the stone [[keep|great tower]] may have been part of the original design.<ref name=Morris2010P37/> Clinton was a local rival to [[Roger de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Roger de Beaumont]], the Earl of Warwick and owner of the neighbouring [[Warwick Castle]], and the king made Clinton the [[sheriff]] in Warwickshire to act as a counter-balance to Beaumont's power.<ref>Crouch, pp116-7.</ref> Clinton had begun to lose the king's favour after 1130 and when he died in in 1133 his son, also called Geoffrey, was only a minor.<ref name=Morris2010P37/> Geoffrey and his uncle, [[William de Clinton]] were forced to come to terms with Beaumont; this set-back, and the difficult years of [[the Anarchy]] (1135<U+2013>54) delayed any further development of the castle.<ref name=Morris2010P37/>

[[Henry II of England|Henry II]] succeeded to the throne at the end of the Anarchy but during the [[revolt of 1173<U+2013>1174|revolt of 1173<U+2013>74]] he faced a significant uprising led by his son, [[Henry the Young King|Henry]], backed by the French crown. The conflict spread across the region and Kenilworth was garrisoned by Henry II's forces; Geoffrey II de Clinton died in this period and the castle was taken fully into royal possession, a sign of its military importance.<ref name=PettiferP257/> The Clintons themselves moved on to [[Buckinghamshire]].<ref>Hull 2009, p.102.</ref> By this point Kenilworth Castle consisted of the great keep, the inner bailey wall, a basic causeway across the smaller lake that preceded the creation of the Great Mere and the local [[Chase (land)|chase]] for hunting.<ref name=Morris2010P37/>

===13th century===

Henry's successor, [[Richard I of England|Richard I]], paid relatively little attention to Kenilworth but under King [[John I of England|John]] significant building resumed at the castle.<ref name=Morris2010P37/> When John was excommunicated in 1208, he embarked on a programme of rebuilding and enhancing several major royal castles. These included [[Corfe Castle (castle)|Corfe]], [[Odiham Castle|Odiham]], [[Dover Castle|Dover]], [[Scarborough Castle|Scarborough]] as well as Kenilworth.<ref name=PettiferP258/> John spent <U+00A3>1,115 on Kenilworth Castle between 1210<U+2013>16,<ref>Allen Brown 1955, p.394, referenced in Cathcart King 1988, p.71.</ref> building the outer bailey wall in stone and improving the other defences, including creating Mortimer's and Lunn's Towers.<ref>Morris 2010, p.29, 37; Pettifer, p.257.</ref><ref group="nb">Comparison of medieval financial figures with modern equivalents is challenging, especially with the larger sums of money used for projects such as castles. <U+00A3>1,100 could equate to from between <U+00A3>578,000 to <U+00A3>13m in 2009 terms, depending on the measure used.</ref>  He also significantly improved the castle's water defences by damming the Finham and Inchford Brooks, creating the Great Mere.<ref>Hull 2006, p.132.</ref> The result was to turn Kenilworth into one of the largest English castles of the time.<ref name=PettiferP257/> John was forced to cede it to the baronial opposition as part of the guarantee of the [[Magna Carta]].<ref name=PettiferP257/>

[[Image:Kenilworth Castle, 2008.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Kenilworth Castle seen from the west; by the 13th century, the foreground would have been occupied by the water defences of the Great Mere.]]
Henry III granted Kenilworth in 1244 to [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], Earl of Leicester, who later became a leader in the [[Second Barons' War]] (1263<U+2013>67) against the king, using Kenilworth as the centre of his operations. Initially the conflict went badly for King Henry, and after the [[Battle of Lewes]] in 1264 he was forced to sign the [[Mise of Lewes]], under which his son, [[Edward I of England|Prince Edward]], was given over to the rebels as a hostage.<ref>Prestwich, pp.46-7.</ref> Edward was taken back to Kenilworth, where chroniclers considered he was held in unduly harsh conditions.<ref>Prestwich, p.47.</ref> Released in early 1265, Edward then defeated Montfort at the [[Battle of Evesham]]; the surviving rebels under the leadership of [[Henry de Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings|Henry de Hastings]], Montfort's [[constable#United Kingdom|constable]] at Kenilworth, regrouped at the castle the following spring.<ref>Carpenter 2004, p.381.</ref> Edward's forces proceeded to lay siege to the rebels.<ref>Prestwich, p.56.</ref>

The [[Siege of Kenilworth|Siege of Kenilworth Castle]] in 1266 is believed to be probably the longest siege in English history, and at the time was also the largest siege to have occurred in England in terms of the number of soldiers involved.<ref>Pounds, p.121; Prestwich, p.56.</ref> Protected by the extensive water defences, the castle withstood the attack, despite Edward targeting the weaker north wall, employing huge [[siege tower]]s and even attempting a night attack using barges brought from [[Chester]].<ref name=HullWhitehorneMorrisP32>Hull and Whitehorne, p.32; Morris 2010, p.40.</ref> The distance between the royal [[trebuchet]]s and the walls severely reduced their effectiveness and heavier trebuchets had to be sent for from London.<ref name=HullWhitehorneMorrisP32/> Papal intervention through the legate [[Pope Adrian V|Ottobuono]] finally resulted in the compromise of the [[Dictum of Kenilworth]], under which the rebels were allowed to re-purchase their confiscated lands provided they surrendered the castle.<ref>Carpenter 2004, p.381; Prestwich, p.57.</ref> The water defences at Kenilworth influenced the construction of later castles in Wales, most notably [[Caerphilly Castle|Caerphilly]].<ref>Hull 2006, p.77.</ref>

Henry granted Kenilworth to his brother, [[Edmund Crouchback]].<ref name=HullWhitehorneSharpeP32>Hull and Whitehorne, p.32; Sharpe, p.13.</ref> Edmund held many tournaments at Kenilworth in the late 13th century, including a huge event in 1279, presided over by the royal favourite [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer|Roger de Mortimer]], in which a hundred knights competed for three days in the tiltyard in an event called "[[Round Table|the Round Table]]", in imitation of the popular [[King Arthur|Arthurian legends]].<ref name=HullWhitehorneSharpeP32/>

===14th century===
[[File:Kenilworth castle keep and great hall.jpg|thumb|300px|The great tower (left) and John of Gaunt's great hall (right).]]

Edmund Crouchback passed on the castle to his eldest son, [[Thomas Plantagenet, 2nd Earl of Lancaster|Thomas, Earl of Lancaster]] in 1298.<ref name=WeirP105>Weir, p.105.</ref> Lancaster married [[Alice Plantagenet, 4th Countess of Lincoln|Alice de Lacy]], which made him the richest nobleman in England.<ref name=PoundsP137>Pounds, p.137.</ref> Kenilworth became the primary castle of the Lancaster estates, replacing of [[Bolingbroke Castle|Bolingbroke]], and acted as both a social and a financial centre for Thomas.<ref name=PoundsP137/> Thomas built the first great hall at the castle between 1314 and constructed the Water Tower along the outer bailey, as well as increasing the size of the chase.<ref>Morris 2010, p.14, 29; Thompson 1877, pp211-8.</ref> Lancaster, with support from many of the other English barons, found himself in increasing opposition to [[Edward II of England|Edward II]].<ref name=WeirP105/> War broke out in 1322, and Lancaster was captured at the [[Battle of Boroughbridge]] and executed.<ref name=WeirP105/> His estates, including Kenilworth, were confiscated by the crown.<ref name=PoundsP137/> Edward and his wife, [[Isabella of France]] spent Christmas 1323 at Kenilworth, amidst major celebrations.<ref>Weir, p.157.</ref>

In 1326, however, Edward was deposed by an alliance of Isabella and her lover, [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]].

===15th century===
[[Image:Model of Kenilworth Castle in 1575-80 trimmed.jpg|thumb|right|325px|A reconstruction of Kenilworth Castle, as it would have appeared around 1575-80.]]
Many castles, especially royal castles were left to decay in the 15th century; Kenilworth, however, continued to be used as a centre of choice, forming a late medieval "palace fortress".<ref>Pounds, p256-7.</ref> [[King Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], John of Gaunt's son, returned Kenilworth to royal ownership when he took the throne in 1399 and made extensive use of the castle.<ref name=PettiferP257/> [[King Henry V of England|Henry V]] also used Kenilworth extensively, but preferred to stay in the Pleasance, the mock castle he had built on the other side of the Great Mere.<ref name=PettiferP257/> According to the contemporary chronicler [[John Strecche]], who lived at the neighbouring [[Kenilworth Priory]], the French openly mocked Henry in 1414 by sending him a gift of [[tennis ball]]s to Kenilworth.<ref name=WalsinghamPreestClarkP399>Walsingham, Preest and Clark, p.399.</ref> The French aim was to imply a lack of marital prowess and according to Strecche spurred Henry's decision to fight the [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt campaign]]; the account was used by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] as the basis for a scene in his play ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''.<ref name=WalsinghamPreestClarkP399/>

English castles, including Kenilworth, did not play a decisive role during the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455<U+2013>85), which were fought primarily in the form of pitched battles between the rival factions of the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrians]] and the [[House of York|Yorkists]].<ref>Pounds, p.249.</ref> With the mental collapse of [[King Henry VI]], [[Margaret of Anjou|Queen Margaret]] used the Duchy of Lancaster lands in the Midlands, including Kenilworth, as one of her key bases of military support.<ref>Carpenter 1997, p.142.</ref> Margaret removed Henry from London in 1456 for his own safety and until 1461, Henry's court spent almost all its time between Kenilworth, [[Leicester Castle|Leicester]] and [[Tutbury Castle]] for the purposes of protection.<ref>Emery 2000, p.200.</ref> Kenilworth remained an important Lancastrian stronghold for the rest of the war, often acting as a military balance to the nearby castle of [[Warwick Castle|Warwick]]. With the victory of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] at [[Battle of Bosworth Field|Bosworth]], Kenilworth again received royal attention; Henry visited frequently and had a [[Real tennis|tennis court]] constructed at the castle for his use.<ref name=Morris2010P45/> His son, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], decided that Kenilworth should be maintained as a royal castle.<ref name=Morris2010P45/> He abandoned the Pleasance and had part of the timber construction moved into the base court of the castle.<ref name=Morris2010P45/>

===16th century===

[[Image:Kenilworth fireplace.jpg|thumb|A marble fireplace in Leicester's gatehouse, with Robert Dudley's initials (R & L for Robert Leicester) and the badge of the [[Order of the Garter]].]]

The castle remained in royal hands until it was given to [[John Dudley]] in 1553. Dudley came to prominence under [[King Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and became the leading political figure under [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. Dudley was a patron of [[John Shute]], an early exponent of classical architecture in England, and began the process of modernising Kenilworth.<ref name=Morris2010P46>Morris 2010, p.46.</ref> Before his execution in 1553 by [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]] for attempting to place [[Lady Jane Grey]] on the throne, Dudley had built the new stable block and widened the tiltyard to its current form.<ref name=Morris2010P46/>

Kenilworth was restored to Dudley's son, [[Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester|Robert, Earl of Leicester]] in 1563, four years after the succession of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] to the throne. Leicester's lands in Warwickshire were worth between <U+00A3>500<U+2013><U+00A3>700 a year to him (approximately <U+00A3>1.25m<U+2013><U+00A3>1.7m in today's terms),<ref>Adams, p.326.</ref><ref name=MeasuringWorthAE>Financial comparison based on average earnings; using the [http://www.measuringworth.com/index.php Measuring Worth] website. Accessed 15 October 2010.</ref> but Leicester's power and wealth, including [[Monopoly#Historical monopolies|monopolies]] and grants of new lands, depended ultimately on his remaining a favourite of the queen.

Leicester continued his father's modernisation of Kenilworth, attempting to ensure that Kenilworth would attract the interest of Elizabeth during her regular tours around the country. Elizabeth visited in 1566 and 1568, by when Leicester had commissioned the royal architect Henry Hawthorne to produce plans for a dramatic, classical extension of the south side of the inner court.<ref>Morris 2007, pp22-35; Morris 2010, p.46.</ref> In the event this proved unachievable and instead Leicester employed William Spicer to rebuild and extend the castle so as to provide modern accommodation for the royal court and symbolically boost his own claims to noble heritage.<ref>Morris 2010, 46-7.</ref> After negotiation with his tenants, Leicester also increased the chase once again.<ref>Adams, p.326.</ref> The result has been termed an English "Renaissance palace".<ref>Johnson 2002, p.142.</ref>

Elizabeth viewed the partially finished results at Kenilworth in 1572, but the complete effect of Leicester's work was only apparent during the queen's last visit in 1575.<ref name=HullWhitehorneMorrisP32>Hull and Whitehorne, p.32; Morris 2010, p.47.</ref> Leicester was keen to impress Elizabeth in a final attempt to convince her to marry him, and no expense was spared. <ref name=Morris2010P53>Morris 2010, p.53.</ref> Elizabeth brought an entourage with of thirty-one barons and four hundred staff for the royal visit that lasted an exceptional nineteen days; twenty horsemen a day arrived at the castle to communicate royal messages.<ref>Hull and Whitehorne, p.32; Morris 2010, p.47; Johnson 2000, p.266.</ref> Leicester entertained the Queen and much of the neighbouring region with pageants, fireworks, [[Bear-baiting|bear baiting]], [[mystery play]]s, hunting and lavish banquets.<ref name=HullWhitehorneP32>Hull and Whitehorne, p.32.</ref> The cost was reputed to have amounted to many thousand pounds, almost bankrupting Leicester, though it probably did not exceed <U+00A3>1,700 (<U+00A3>4.25m) in reality.<ref>Haynes, pp. 119<U+2013>120.</ref> The event was considered a huge success and formed the longest stay at such a property during any of Elizabeth's tours, yet the queen did not decide to marry Leicester.<ref name=Morris2010P53/>

===17th century===

[[Image:Kenilworth Castle window in Leicester's gatehouse.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of Leicester's gatehouse, converted into a domestic house by Colonel Hawkesworth after the [[English Civil War]].]]
Kenilworth Castle was valued at <U+00A3>10,401 (<U+00A3>23.4m), when Leicester died in 1588 without legitimate issue and heavily in debt.<ref>Sharpe, p.28.</ref> In accordance with his will, the castle passed first to his brother [[Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick|Ambrose, Earl of Warwick]], and after the latter's death in 1590, to his illegitimate son, [[Robert Dudley (explorer)|Sir Robert Dudley]].<ref name=ODNB RobDudley">Simon Adams: [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8161 "Dudley, Sir Robert (1574<U+2013>1649)"], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edition, January 2008.

[[English Civil War|Civil war broke out in England]], however, in 1642. During the early campaigns of the war Kenilworth formed a useful counter-balance to the Parliamentary stronghold of Warwick.<ref name=RobertsTinceyP46>Roberts and Tincey, p.46.</ref> Kenilworth was used by Charles on his advance to Edgehill in October 1642 as a base for raids on Parliamentary strongholds in the Midlands.<ref name=RobertsTinceyP46/> After the battle, however, the royalist garrison was withdrawn on the approach of [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke|Lord Brooke]] and the castle was garrisoned by parliamentary forces.<ref>Hughes, p.148.</ref> The new governor of the castle, Hastings Ingram was arrested in April 1643 as a suspected Royalist [[double agent]].<ref>Hughes, p.181.</ref> By January 1645 the Parliamentary forces in Coventry had strengthened their hold on the castle and attempts by Royalist forces to dislodge them from Warwickshire failed.<ref>Hutton, p.46.</ref> Security concerns continued after the end of the first civil war in 1646, and in 1649 Parliament ordered the [[slighting]] of Kenilworth. One wall of the great tower, various parts of the outer bailey and the battlements were destroyed, but not before the building was surveyed by the antiquarian [[William Dugdale]], who published his results in 1656.<ref name=Morris2010P50>Morris 2010, p.50.</ref>

Colonel Joseph Hawkesworth, responsible for the implementation of the slighting, acquired the estate for himself and converted Leicester's gatehouse into a house; part of the base court was turned into a farm and many of the remaining buildings were stripped  for their raw materials.<ref name=Morris2010P50/> In 1660 [[King Charles II of England|Charles II]] was restored to the throne and Hawkesworth was promptly evicted from Kenilworth.<ref name=Morris2010P51>Morris 2010, p.51.</ref> The Queen Mother, Henrietta Maria, briefly regained the castle, with the earls of Monmouth acting as stewards once again, but after her death [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] gave the castle to [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Sir Edward Hyde]], whom he created Baron Hyde of Hindon and Earl of Clarendon.<ref>Sharpe, p.29; Morris 2010, p.51.</ref> The ruined castle continued to be used as a farm, with the gatehouse as the principle dwelling.<ref name=Morris2010P51/>

===18th and 19th centuries===

[[Image:Georg Saal Kenilworth.jpg|thumb|right|Kenilworth Castle, painted by Georg Saal in the mid-19th century.]]

Kenilworth remained a ruin during the 18th and 19th centuries, still used as a farm but increasingly also popular as a tourist attraction. The first guidebook to the castle, ''A Concise history and description of Kenilworth Castle'', was printed in 1777 with many later editions following in the coming decades.<ref>Morris 2010, p.51.</ref><ref group="nb">See Sharpe, 1825 for the 25th edition of the original guidebook.</ref> 

The castle's cultural prominence increased after Sir [[Walter Scott]] wrote ''[[Kenilworth (novel)|Kenilworth]]'' in 1821 describing the royal visit of Queen Elizabeth.  Very loosely based on the events of 1575, Scott's story reinvented aspects of the castle and its history to tell the story of "the pathetic, beautiful, undisciplined heroine [[Amy Robsart]] and the steely Elizabeth I".<ref>Shaw, p.177.</ref> Although considered today as a less successful literary novel than some of his other historical works, it popularised Kenilworth Castle in the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] imagination as a romantic Elizabethan location.<ref>Morris 2010, pp51-2; Shaw, p.177.</ref> ''Kenilworth'' spawned "numerous stage adaptations and [[burlesque]]s, at least eleven operas, popular [[redaction]]s, and even a scene in a set of [[diorama]]s for home display", including Sir [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s 1865 opera ''[[The Masque at Kenilworth]]''.<ref>Hackett, p.60.</ref> 

The number of visitors increased, including [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Charles Dickens]].<ref name=Morris2010P52>Morris 2010, p.52.</ref> Work was undertaken during the 19th century to protect the stonework from further decline, with particular efforts to remove [[ivy]] from the castle in the 1860s.<ref name=Morris2010P52/>

==Today==

The castle remained the property of the Clarendons until 1937, when [[George Villiers, 6th Earl of Clarendon|Lord Clarendon]] found the maintenance of the castle too expensive and sold Kenilworth to the industrialist [[John Davenport Siddeley, 1st Baron Kenilworth|Sir John Siddeley]].<ref name=Morris2010P52/> Siddeley, whose tax accounting in the 1930s had been at least questionable, was keen to improve his public image and gave over the running of the castle, complete with a charitable donation, to the [[First Commissioner of Works|Commissioner of Works]].<ref>Smith, p.302.</ref> In 1958 his son gave the castle itself to the town of [[Kenilworth]] and [[English Heritage]] has managed the property since 1984.<ref>Smith, p.302; Morris, p.52.</ref> The castle is classed as a Grade I [[listed building]] and as a [[Scheduled Monument]], and is open to the public.<ref>[http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=333827&sort=4&search=all&criteria=kenilworth%20castle&rational=q&recordsperpage=10 National Monuments Record]. Accessed 5 October 2010.</ref>

Between 2005<U+2013>09 English Heritage attempted to restore Kenilworth's garden more closely to its Elizabethan form, using as a basis the description in the [[Langham letter]] and details from recent archaeological investigations.<ref>[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.20667 English Heritage website]. Accessed 10 October 2010.</ref> The reconstruction cost more than <U+00A3>2m and was criticised by some archaeologists as a being "matter of simulation as much as reconstruction", due to the limited amount of factual information on the nature of the original gardens.<ref>Greene and Moore, p.298.</ref> In 2008 plans were put forward to re-create and flood the original Great Mere around the castle. As well as re-creating the look of the castle it was hoped that a new mere would be part of the ongoing flood alleviation plan for the area and that the lake could be used for boating and other waterside recreations.<ref>[http://www.warwickdc.gov.uk/WDC/Your-Council/News/Warwick+District+Council+Archived+News/News+-+2008/Float+your+boat+in+Kenilworth+Moat.htm Warwick District Council 5 December 2008].
