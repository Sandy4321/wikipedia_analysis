'''Nirbhay''' ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: <U+0928><U+093F><U+0930><U+094D><U+092D><U+092F>, [[Indic transliteration|Nirbhay]] ''"Dauntless/Fearless"'') is a long range, [[Subsonic aircraft|subsonic]] [[cruise missile]]<ref name="cri.cn"/> being developed in [[India]] by the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]].

==Description==
Nirbhay will be a all-weather low-cost medium-range cruise missile with stealth and high accuracy.<ref name=toi19j>{{cite news|title=Nirbhay to be test-fired in February|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Nirbhay-to-be-test-fired-in-February/articleshow/18082334.cms|accessdate=19 January 2013|newspaper=The Times of India|date=19 January 2013}}</ref> The missile will have a range of 750km, which will be increased later.<ref>[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1070720/asp/nation/story_8080771.asp Fearless Tomahawk-type missile on radar]</ref> It will weighing about one tonne and will have a lenght of 6 metres. It will carry a [[ring laser gyroscope]] for high-accuracy navigation and a radio altimeter for the height determination.<ref name=idrw25>{{cite web|title=India to test subsonic cruise missile in February|url=http://idrw.org/?p=17792|publisher=IDRW News|accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref> It will be capable of being launched from multiple platforms on land, sea and air and shall be inducted into [[Indian Navy]], [[Indian Army|Army]], and [[Indian Air Force|Air Force]]. In particular, Nirbhay will be adapted for the Indo/Russian [[Su-30MKI]]. It was reported in May 2010 that the missile will be capable of carrying nuclear warheads.<ref name=Rusnavy/>

A DRDO official told [[The Hindu]] in March 2012 that the two-stage missile Nirbhay will be able to pick out a target and attack it among multiple targets. The missile will also have a loitering capability i.e it can go round a target and perform several manoeuvres and then re-engage it.<ref name=The_hindu>{{cite news|last=T. S.

==Development and trials==
The missile is being developed by the Advanced Systems Laboratory (ASL), Hyderabad,<ref name=toi5s>{{cite news|title=<U+2018>Nirbhay<U+2019> missile set for test-firing next month|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-05/india/33615016_1_inter-continental-ballistic-missile-missile-project-stealth-missile|accessdate=19 January 2013|newspaper=The Times of India|date=5 September 2012}}</ref> a lab of [[ Aeronautical Development Establishment]] (ADE). ADE is a division of [[DRDO]].<ref name=toi25j>{{cite news|title=India to test subsonic cruise missile in February|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-to-test-subsonic-cruise-missile-in-February/articleshow/18184608.cms|accessdate=25 January 2013|newspaper=The Times of India|date=25 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=ec25j>{{cite news|title=India to launch sub-sonic missile, Nirbhay, next month: DRDO|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/india-to-launch-sub-sonic-missile-nirbhay-next-month-drdo/articleshow/18182021.cms|accessdate=25 January 2013|newspaper=The Economic Times|date=25 January 2013}}</ref> After the design was finalized, the technology required for the missile was developed. It is being integrated by R&D Engineers, Pune, a specialised arm of DRDO.<ref name=hindd /> Indian private sector giant [[Tata]] revealed that it will build the vehicle that will be the carrier/launcher for the Nirbhay system and will be based on an "indigenous high mobility, all-terrain and all-wheel drive Tata LPTA 5252-12 X12 vehicle", developed in partnership with DRDO.<ref name=tmdv>{{cite web|title=Tata Motors<U+2019> Defence Vehicles|url=http://tatamotors.com/pdf/defence-expo-2012-background-note.pdf|work=DEFEXPO 2012|publisher=Tata Motors|accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref>

The first test flight of the missile was expected in October 2012,<ref>[http://mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype=local&newsid=48826 India plans to test new medium-range missile in 2009]</ref><ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Nirbhay-missile-set-for-test-firing-next-month/articleshow/16257102.cms DRDO test firing Nirbhay]</ref> but the launch was shifted to December owing to the changes being made to the launcher. [[V K Saraswat]], director general of DRDO, has said that the missile will be tested in February 2013. He said the delay was due to development of some processes. DRDO expects the missile to be ready for induction within 12 to 18 months after the February test.<ref name=toi19j /><ref name=ec25j /><ref name=toi25j />
