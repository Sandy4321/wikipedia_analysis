'''Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide''', abbreviated '''NAD{{sup|+}}''', is a [[coenzyme]] found in all living [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. The compound is a dinucleotide, since it consists of two [[nucleotide]]s joined through their phosphate groups, with one nucleotide containing an [[adenine]] base and the other containing [[nicotinamide]].

In [[metabolism]], NAD{{sup|+}} is involved in [[redox]] reactions, carrying [[electron]]s from one reaction to another. The coenzyme is therefore found in two forms in cells: NAD{{sup|+}} is an [[oxidizing agent]]&nbsp;<U+2013> it accepts electrons from other molecules and becomes [[redox|reduced]]. This reaction forms '''NADH''', which can then be used as a [[reducing agent]] to donate electrons. These electron transfer reactions are the main function of NAD{{sup|+}}. However, it is also used in other cellular processes, notably as a [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] of enzymes that add or remove [[functional group|chemical groups]] from proteins, in [[posttranslational modification]]s. Because of the importance of these functions, the [[enzyme]]s involved in NAD{{sup|+}} metabolism are targets for [[drug discovery]].

In organisms, NAD{{sup|+}} can be synthesized from simple building blocks ([[De novo synthesis|''de novo'']]) from the amino acids [[tryptophan]] or [[aspartic acid]]. Alternatively, more complex components of the coenzymes are taken up from food as the [[vitamin]] called [[niacin]]. Similar compounds are released by reactions that break down the structure of NAD{{sup|+}}. These preformed components then pass through a salvage pathway that recycles them back into the active form. Some NAD{{sup|+}} is also converted into [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate]] (NADP{{sup|+}}); the chemistry of this related coenzyme is similar to that of NAD{{sup|+}}, but it has different roles in metabolism.

==Physical and chemical properties==
{{further|[[Redox]]}}
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, like all ''dinucleotide''s, consists of two [[nucleotide]]s joined by a pair of bridging phosphate groups. The [[nucleotide]]s consist of [[ribose]] rings, one with [[adenine]] attached to the first carbon atom (the [[Nucleic acid nomenclature|1']] position) and the other with [[nicotinamide]] at this position. The nicotinamide moiety can be attached in two orientations to this [[anomer]]ic carbon atom. Because of these two possible structures, the compound exists as two [[diastereomer]]s. It is the <U+03B2>-nicotinamide diastereomer of NAD{{sup|+}} which is found in organisms. These nucleotides are joined together by a bridge of two [[phosphate]] groups through the 5' carbons.<ref name=Pollak>{{cite journal | last = Pollak | first = N | coauthors = D<U+00F6>lle C, Ziegler M | title = The power to reduce: pyridine nucleotides<U+2014>small molecules with a multitude of functions | journal = Biochem.

Both NAD{{sup|+}} and NADH absorb strongly in the [[ultraviolet]] due to the adenine base.

The balance between the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD{{sup|+}}/NADH ratio. This ratio is an important component of what is called the ''redox state'' of a cell, a measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health of cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schafer F, Buettner G |title=Redox environment of the cell as viewed through the redox state of the glutathione disulfide/glutathione couple |journal=Free Radic Biol Med |volume=30 |issue=11 |pages=1191<U+2013>212 |year=2001 | pmid=11368918 |doi=10.1016/S0891-5849(01)00480-4}}</ref> The effects of the NAD{{sup|+}}/NADH ratio are complex, controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase]] and [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]].

==Biosynthesis==
NAD{{sup|+}} is synthesized through two metabolic pathways. It is produced either in a ''[[De novo synthesis|de novo]]'' pathway from [[amino acid]]s, or in salvage pathways by recycling preformed components such as [[nicotinamide]] back to NAD{{sup|+}}. 

===''De novo'' production===
[[Image:NAD metabolism.svg|thumb|right|350px|Some [[metabolic pathway]]s that synthesize and consume NAD{{sup|+}} in [[vertebrate]]s. The abbreviations are defined in the text.]]
Most organisms synthesize NAD{{sup|+}} from simple components.<ref name=Belenky/> The specific set of reactions differs among organisms, but a common feature is the generation of quinolinic acid (QA) from an amino acid <U+2013> either [[tryptophan]] (Trp) in animals and some bacteria, or [[aspartic acid]] in some bacteria and plants.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Katoh A, Uenohara K, Akita M, Hashimoto T |title=Early steps in the biosynthesis of NAD in Arabidopsis start with aspartate and occur in the plastid |journal=Plant Physiol. |volume=141 |issue=3 |pages=851<U+2013>7 |year=2006 |pmid=16698895 |pmc=1489895 |doi=10.1104/pp.106.081091 |url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16698895}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Foster JW, Moat AG |title=Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide biosynthesis and pyridine nucleotide cycle metabolism in microbial systems |journal=Microbiol.

In a further step, some NAD{{sup|+}} is converted into NADP{{sup|+}} by [[NAD+ kinase]], which phosphorylates NAD{{sup|+}}.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Magni G, Orsomando G, Raffaelli N |title=Structural and functional properties of NAD kinase, a key enzyme in NADP biosynthesis |journal=Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=739<U+2013>46 |year=2006 |pmid=16842123 |doi=10.2174/138955706777698688}}</ref> In most organisms, this enzyme uses ATP as the source of the phosphate group, although in bacteria such as ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' and in [[archaea]] such as ''[[Pyrococcus|Pyrococcus horikoshii]]'', inorganic [[polyphosphate]] is an alternative phosphate donor.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sakuraba H, Kawakami R, Ohshima T |title=First archaeal inorganic polyphosphate/ATP-dependent NAD kinase, from hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii: cloning, expression, and characterization |journal=Appl.

[[Image:NA, N and NR.svg|thumb|left|300px|Salvage pathways use three precursors for NAD+.]]

===Salvage pathways===

Besides assembling NAD{{sup|+}} ''de novo'' from simple amino acid precursors, cells also salvage preformed compounds containing nicotinamide. Although other precursors are known, the three natural compounds containing the nicotinamide ring and used in these salvage metabolic pathways are nicotinic acid (Na), nicotinamide (Nam) and nicotinamide riboside (NR).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tempel W, Rabeh WM, Bogan KL, ''et al.'' |title=Nicotinamide riboside kinase structures reveal new pathways to NAD+ |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=e263 |year=2007 |pmid=17914902 |pmc=1994991 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050263}}</ref> The precursors are fed into the NAD(P){{sup|+}} biosynthetic pathway, shown above, through adenylation and phosphoribosylation reactions.<ref name=Belenky/> These compounds can be taken up from the diet, where the mixture of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are called vitamin B{{sub|3}} or ''[[niacin]]''. However, these compounds are also produced within cells, when the nicotinamide moiety is released from NAD{{sup|+}} in ADP-ribose transfer reactions. Indeed, the enzymes involved in these salvage pathways appear to be concentrated in the [[cell nucleus]], which may compensate for the high level of reactions that consume NAD{{sup|+}} in this [[organelle]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Anderson RM, Bitterman KJ, Wood JG, ''et al.'' |title=Manipulation of a nuclear NAD+ salvage pathway delays aging without altering steady-state NAD+ levels |journal=J.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide has several essential roles in [[metabolism]]. It acts as a [[coenzyme]] in [[redox]] reactions, as a donor of ADP-ribose moieties in [[ADP-ribosylation]] reactions, as a precursor of the [[second messenger system|second messenger]] molecule [[cyclic ADP-ribose]], as well as acting as a substrate for bacterial [[DNA ligase]]s and a group of enzymes called [[sirtuin]]s that use NAD{{sup|+}} to remove [[acetyl|acetyl groups]] from proteins.

===Oxidoreductases===

{{further|[[Protein structure]] and [[Oxidoreductase]]s}}

The main role of NAD{{sup|+}} in metabolism is the transfer of electrons from one molecule to another. Reactions of this type  are catalyzed by a large group of enzymes called [[oxidoreductase]]s. The correct names for these enzymes contain the names of both their substrates: for example [[NADH dehydrogenase|NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase]] catalyzes the oxidation of NADH by [[coenzyme Q]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme | title = Enzyme Nomenclature, Recommendations for enzyme names from the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | accessdate = 2007-12-06}}</ref> However, these enzymes are also referred to as ''dehydrogenases'' or ''reductases'', with NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase commonly being called ''NADH dehydrogenase'' or sometimes ''coenzyme Q reductase''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.expasy.org/enzyme/1.6.5.3 |title=NiceZyme View of ENZYME: EC 1.6.5.3 |accessdate=2007-12-16 |publisher=Expasy}}</ref>

When bound to a protein, NAD{{sup|+}} and NADH are usually held within a [[structural motif]] known as the [[Rossmann fold]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lesk AM |title=NAD-binding domains of dehydrogenases |journal=Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=775<U+2013>83 |year=1995 |pmid=8749365 |doi=10.1016/0959-440X(95)80010-7}}</ref> The motif is named after [[Michael Rossmann]] who was the first scientist to notice how common this structure is within nucleotide-binding proteins.<ref name=Rao>{{cite journal |author=Rao S, Rossmann M |title=Comparison of super-secondary structures in proteins |journal=J Mol Biol |volume=76 |issue=2 | pages=241<U+2013>56 |year=1973 |pmid=4737475 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(73)90388-4}}</ref> This fold contains three or more parallel [[beta sheet|beta strands]] linked by two [[alpha helix|alpha helices]] in the order beta-alpha-beta-alpha-beta. This forms a beta sheet flanked by a layer of alpha helices on each side. Because each Rossmann fold binds one nucleotide, binding domains for the dinucleotide NAD{{sup|+}} consist of two paired Rossmann folds, with each fold binding one nucleotide within the cofactor.<ref name=Rao/> However, this fold is not universal among NAD-dependent enzymes, since a class of bacterial enzymes involved in [[amino acid]] metabolism have recently been discovered that bind the coenzyme, but lack this motif.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goto M, Muramatsu H, Mihara H, ''et al.'' |title=Crystal structures of Delta1-piperideine-2-carboxylate/Delta1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate reductase belonging to a new family of NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductases: conformational change, substrate recognition, and stereochemistry of the reaction |journal=J.

When bound in the active site of an oxidoreductase, the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme is positioned so that it can accept a hydride from the other substrate. Since the C4 carbon that accepts the hydrogen is [[prochiral]], this can be exploited in [[enzyme kinetics]] to give information about the enzyme's mechanism. This is done by mixing an enzyme with a substrate that has [[deuterium]] atoms substituted for the hydrogens, so the enzyme will reduce NAD{{sup|+}} by transferring deuterium rather than hydrogen. In this case an enzyme can produce one of two [[Stereoisomerism|stereoisomer]]s of NADH. In some enzymes the hydrogen is transferred from above the plane of the nicotinamide ring, these are called ''class A'' oxidoreductases, while class B enzymes transfer the atom from below.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bellamacina CR |title=The nicotinamide dinucleotide binding motif: a comparison of nucleotide binding proteins |journal=FASEB J. |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=1257<U+2013>69 |date=1 September 1996|pmid=8836039 |url=http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8836039 }}</ref>

Despite the similarity in how proteins bind the two coenzymes, enzymes almost always show a high level of specificity for either NAD{{sup|+}} or NADP{{sup|+}}.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carugo O, Argos P |title=NADP-dependent enzymes. I: Conserved stereochemistry of cofactor binding |journal=Proteins |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=10<U+2013>28 |year=1997 |pmid=9144787 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0134(199705)28:1<10::AID-PROT2>3.0.CO;2-N}}</ref> This specificity reflects the distinct metabolic roles of the respective coenzymes, and is the result of distinct sets of [[amino acid]] residues in the two types of coenzyme-binding pocket. For instance, in the active site of NADP-dependent enzymes, an [[ionic bond]] is formed between a basic amino acid side chain and the acidic phosphate group of NADP{{sup|+}}. Conversely, in NAD-dependent enzymes the charge in this pocket is reversed, preventing NADP{{sup|+}} from binding. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule, and enzymes such as [[aldose reductase]], [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]], and [[methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase]] can use both coenzymes in some species.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vickers TJ, Orsomando G, de la Garza RD, ''et al.'' |title=Biochemical and genetic analysis of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase in Leishmania metabolism and virulence |journal=J.

===Role in redox metabolism===

[[Image:Catabolism schematic.svg|thumb|250px|A simplified outline of redox [[metabolism]], showing how NAD{{sup|+}} and NADH link the [[citric acid cycle]] and [[oxidative phosphorylation]].]]

{{Further|[[Cellular respiration]] and [[Oxidative phosphorylation]]}}

The redox reactions catalyzed by oxidoreductases are vital in all parts of metabolism, but one particularly important area where these reactions occur is in the release of energy from nutrients. Here, reduced compounds such as [[glucose]] are oxidized, thereby releasing energy. This energy is transferred to NAD{{sup|+}} by reduction to NADH, as part of [[glycolysis]] and the [[citric acid cycle]]. In [[eukaryote]]s the electrons carried by the NADH that is produced in the [[cytoplasm]] by glycolysis are transferred into the [[mitochondrion]] (to reduce mitochondrial NAD{{sup|+}}) by [[mitochondrial shuttle]]s, such as the [[malate-aspartate shuttle]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bakker BM, Overkamp KM, van Maris AJ, ''et al.'' |title=Stoichiometry and compartmentation of NADH metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae |journal=FEMS Microbiol.

Since both the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide are used in these linked sets of reactions, the cell maintains approximately equal concentrations of NAD{{sup|+}} and NADH; the high NAD{{sup|+}}/NADH ratio allows this coenzyme to act as both an oxidizing and a reducing agent.<ref name=Nicholls>{{cite book|author=Nicholls DG|coauthors=Ferguson SJ|title=Bioenergetics 3 |edition=1st|publisher=Academic Press|year=2002 |isbn=0-125-18121-3}}</ref> In contrast, the main function of NADP{{sup|+}} is as a reducing agent in [[anabolism]], with this coenzyme being involved in pathways such as [[fatty acid synthesis]] and [[photosynthesis]]. Since NADPH is needed to drive redox reactions as a strong reducing agent, the NADP{{sup|+}}/NADPH ratio is kept very low.<ref name=Nicholls/>

Although it is important in catabolism, NADH is also used in anabolic reactions, such as [[gluconeogenesis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sistare FD, Haynes RC |title=The interaction between the cytosolic pyridine nucleotide redox potential and gluconeogenesis from lactate/pyruvate in isolated rat hepatocytes. Implications for investigations of hormone action |journal=J. Biol.

For example, [[nitrification|nitrifying]] bacteria such as ''[[Nitrobacter]]'' oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which releases sufficient energy to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH directly.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Freitag A, Bock E|year=1990 |title=Energy conservation in Nitrobacter |journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters |volume=66 |issue=1<U+2013>3 |pages=157<U+2013>62 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.1990.tb03989.x}}</ref> As NADH is still needed for anabolic reactions, these bacteria use a [[nitrite oxidoreductase]] to produce enough [[chemiosmosis|proton-motive force]] to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, generating NADH.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Starkenburg SR, Chain PS, Sayavedra-Soto LA, ''et al.'' |title=Genome sequence of the chemolithoautotrophic nitrite-oxidizing bacterium Nitrobacter winogradskyi Nb-255 |journal=Appl.

===Non-redox roles===

The coenzyme NAD{{sup|+}} is also consumed in ADP-ribose transfer reactions. For example, enzymes called [[Glycosyltransferase|ADP-ribosyltransferases]] add the ADP-ribose moiety of this molecule to proteins, in a [[posttranslational modification]] called [[ADP-ribosylation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ziegler M |title=New functions of a long-known molecule.

[[Image:Cyclic ADP Ribose.PNG|thumb|left|280px|The structure of [[cyclic ADP-ribose]].]]
Another function of this coenzyme in cell signaling is as a precursor of [[cyclic ADP-ribose]], which is produced from NAD{{sup|+}} by ADP-ribosyl cyclases, as part of a [[second messenger system]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Guse AH |title=Biochemistry, biology, and pharmacology of cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose (cADPR) |journal=Curr.

NAD{{sup|+}} is also consumed by [[sirtuin]]s, which are NAD-dependent [[Histone deacetylase|deacetylases]], such as [[Sir2]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=North B, Verdin E |title=Sirtuins: Sir2-related NAD-dependent protein deacetylases |journal=Genome Biol |volume=5 |issue=5 |page=224 |year=2004 |pmid=15128440 |pmc=416462 |doi=10.1186/gb-2004-5-5-224}}</ref> These enzymes act by transferring an [[acetyl]] group from their substrate protein to the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD{{sup|+}}; this cleaves the coenzyme and releases nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose.

Other NAD-dependent enzymes include bacterial [[DNA ligase]]s, which join two DNA ends by using NAD{{sup|+}} as a substrate to donate an [[adenosine monophosphate]] (AMP) moiety to the 5' phosphate of one DNA end. This intermediate is then attacked by the 3' hydroxyl group of the other DNA end, forming a new [[phosphodiester bond]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wilkinson A, Day J, Bowater R |title=Bacterial DNA ligases |journal=Mol.

{{Further|[[History of biochemistry]]}}

The coenzyme NAD{{sup|+}} was first discovered by the [[United Kingdom|British]] biochemists [[Arthur Harden]] and [[William Youndin]] in 1906.<ref>{{cite journal | first = A | last = Harden | coauthors = Young, WJ | title = The Alcoholic Ferment of Yeast-Juice | work = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London | edition = Series B, Containing Papers of a Biological Character | volume = 78 | number = 526 | month = October | year = 1906 | pages =  369<U+2013>375}}</ref> They noticed that adding boiled and filtered [[yeast]] extract greatly accelerated [[alcoholic fermentation]] in unboiled yeast extracts. They called the unidentified factor responsible for this effect a ''coferment''. Through a long and difficult purification from yeast extracts, this heat-stable factor was identified as a [[nucleotide]] sugar phosphate by [[Hans von Euler-Chelpin]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1929/euler-chelpin-lecture.pdf | title = Fermentation of sugars and fermentative enzymes | work = Nobel Lecture, 23 May 1930 | accessdate=2007-09-30 | publisher = Nobel Foundation|format=PDF}}</ref> In 1936, the [[Germany|German]] scientist [[Otto Heinrich Warburg]] showed the function of the nucleotide coenzyme in hydride transfer and identified the nicotinamide portion as the site of redox reactions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Warburg O, Christian W.|title=Pyridin, the hydrogen-transferring component of the fermentation enzymes (pyridine nucleotide)  |journal=Biochemische Zeitschrift |volume=287 |year=1936 |page=291}}</ref> 

A source of nicotinamide was identified in 1938, when [[Conrad Elvehjem]] purified [[niacin]] from liver and showed this vitamin contained nicotinic acid and nicotinamide.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Elvehjem CA, Madden RJ, Strong FM, Woolley DW. |title=The isolation and identification of the anti-black tongue factor |journal=J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. |volume=131 |issue=1 |pages=85<U+2013>93 |year=1939 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/131/1/85.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> In the early 1940s, [[Arthur Kornberg]] made another important contribution towards understanding NAD{{sup|+}} metabolism, by being the first to detect an enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kornberg, A. |title=The participation of inorganic pyrophosphate in the reversible enzymatic synthesis of diphosphopyridine nucleotide |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=176 |issue=3 |pages=1475<U+2013>76 |year=1948 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/176/3/1475.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> Subsequently, in 1949, the [[United States|American]] biochemists Morris Friedkin and [[Albert L. Lehninger]] proved that NADH linked metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle with the synthesis of ATP in oxidative phosphorylation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Friedkin M, Lehninger AL. |title=Esterification of inorganic phosphate coupled to electron transport between dihydrodiphosphopyridine nucleotide and oxygen |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=178 |issue=2 |pages=611<U+2013>23 |date=1 April 1949|url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/178/2/611 }}</ref> Finally, in 1959, Jack Preiss and Philip Handler discovered the intermediates and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of NAD{{sup|+}};<ref>{{cite journal |author=Preiss J, Handler P. |title=Biosynthesis of diphosphopyridine nucleotide. I. Identification of intermediates |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=233 |issue=2 |pages=488<U+2013>92 |date=1 August 1958|pmid=13563526 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/233/2/488 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Preiss J, Handler P. |title=Biosynthesis of diphosphopyridine nucleotide.

The non-redox roles of NAD(P) are a recent discovery.<ref name=Pollak/> The first of these functions to be identified was the use of NAD{{sup|+}} as the ADP-ribose donor in ADP-ribosylation reactions, observed in the early 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chambon P, Weill JD, Mandel P |title=Nicotinamide mononucleotide activation of new DNA-dependent polyadenylic acid synthesizing nuclear enzyme |journal=Biochem.
