'''Paolo Orano''' (born 15 June 1875 in [[Rome]] - died 7 April 1945 in [[Padula]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[psychology|psychologist]] and [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] politician and writer who later became a leading figure within the [[National Fascist Party]].

==Syndicalism==
Orano began his political career as one of a number of leading syndicalist thinkers associated with the [[Italian Socialist Party]] at the turn of the century. His estrangement from the Socialists began in 1905 when he resigned his position at the newspaper ''[[Avanti! (Italian newspaper)|Avanti!]]'' following the dismissal of syndicalist [[Enrico Leone]].<ref>[[Zeev Sternhell]], Mario Sznajder & Maia Ash<U+00E9>ri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', 1995, p. 112</ref> 

Along with fellow syndicalists [[Arturo Labriola]] and [[Robert Michels]], as well as nationalist [[Enrico Corradini]], Orano became part of a group of intellectuals who followed the ideals of [[Georges Sorel]].<ref>Matthew Affron & Mark Antliff, ''Fascist Visions: Art and Ideology in France and Italy'', 1997, p. 6</ref> To this end he founded his own weekly newspaper, ''[[La lupa (newspaper)|La Lupa]]'', in October 1910.<ref>Sternhell et al, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology'',p. 236</ref> It came to represent the first collaboration between syndicalists like Orano and nationalists like [[Enrico Corradini]].<ref>Sternhell et al, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology'', p. 32</ref> [[Benito Mussolini]] would later claim that this paper was an influence on his political ideas.<ref>[[Ernst Nolte]], ''Three Faces of Fascism'', 1969, p. 313</ref>

Orano became a strong critic of democracy, seeing it as the cause of Italy's ills and his rhetoric, along with that of fellow syndicalists such as [[Filippo Corridoni]] and [[Angelo Olivetti]], was by 1914 very similar to that coming from the [[Italian Nationalist Association]].<ref>Anthony James Gregor, ''Mussolini's Intellectuals'', 2004, p. 58</ref> Orano supported the [[First World War]], ostensibly because he hoped that it would strengthen both the [[bourgeoisie]] and [[proletariat]] and thus hasten the process of [[class conflict]] and revolution. However his views caused considerable controversy within the syndicalist movement and helped to bring about its fragmentation as many of those associated with the movement, in particular Leone, were anti-war.<ref>Michael Miller Topp, ''Those Without a Country: The Political Culture of Italian American Syndicalists'', 2001, p. 75</ref> By the end of the war his positions were largely indistinguishable from those of the nationalists.<ref>Gregor, ''Mussolini's Intellectuals'', p. 85</ref>

==Fascism==
Orano soon moved over to the Fascists and during the [[March on Rome]] he served as Mussolini's chief of staff, whilst also occupying a seat on the Grand Council of the party.<ref name="Gins">Paul Ginsborg, ''A History of Contemporary Italy: Society and Politics, 1943-1988'', p. 92</ref> He enjoyed a high profile under the fascist government, serving in the parliament and holding the post of rector of the [[University of Perugia]].<ref name="Zimmer">Joshua D. Zimmerman, ''Jews in Italy under Fascist and Nazi Rule, 1922-1945'', 2005, p. 29</ref>

His most notable contribution to fascism was his [[anti-semitism]] and he was the author in 1937 of the book ''The Jews in Italy''.<ref>R.J.B. Bosworth, ''The Oxford Handbook of Fascism'', Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 308</ref> The book was influenced by [[Bernard Lazare]] in so much as it accepted his thesis that the activities of the [[Jews]] themselves helped to cause anti-semitism, although it made no reference to Lazare's refutations of the prejudice.<ref>Wiley Feinstein, ''The Civilization of the Holocaust in Italy'', 2003, p. 164</ref> In the book Orano expressed affection for some individual [[Jew]]s, notably [[Ettore Ovazza]], but nonetheless the book helped to legitimise anti-Semitism as a part of [[Italian fascism]] and laid the groundwork for later persecutions.<ref name="Zimmer"/> Despite this the non-biological nature of his anti-semitism meant that he did not go far enough for [[Giovanni Preziosi]], who attacked Orano's work in his journal ''La Vita Italiana''.<ref>David D. Roberts, ''The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism'', 1979, pp. 323-4</ref>

Captured in 1944 he was held along with many fellow fascist officials at a prison camp at Padula where he died the following year following complications with a [[peptic ulcer]] haemorrhage.

==Other writing==
As well as his political writing Orano was also noted for his psychological and philosophical work. His 1897 book ''Cristo e Quirino'' criticised [[Christianity]] from a [[Nietzschean]] perspective, suggesting that it told people to accept their lot in life and thus solidified [[hierarchy]] in society.<ref>Richard A. Webster, ''The Cross and the Fasces: Christian Democracy and Fascism in Italy'', 1960, p. 32</ref> Mussolini would later use these arguments about the parallels between the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Roman Empire]], and thus common ground between fascism and Catholicism, during his negotiations with [[Pope Pius XI|Pius XI]], much to horror of the pontiff who considered the very notion heretical.<ref>Webster, ''The Cross and the Fasces'', p. 110</ref>

His 1902 book ''Psicologica Sociale'' sought to attack [[transpersonal psychology]] and instead argued in favour of [[materialism]] and [[inductive reasoning]] that took into account the works of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Charles Darwin]].<ref>Jaap van Ginneken, ''Crowds, Psychology, and Politics, 1871-1899'', 1992, p. 88</ref>
