{{Campaignbox Quasi-War}}

The '''USS Constellation vs L'Insurgente''', or the '''Action of 9 February 1799''', was the first United States naval victory against a foreign naval vessel. A [[single-ship action]]  fought between [[frigate]]s of the [[French Navy]] and the [[United States Navy]] during the [[Quasi-War]], the battle resulted in the  {{USS|Constellation|1797|6}}{{'s}} capture of [[French frigate Insurgente (1793)|''L'Insurgente'']].

The previous year, an [[undeclared war]] had begun between the [[United States]] and [[France]] due to French [[privateer]]ing attacks against American vessels. An American [[squadron (naval)|squadron]] under Commodore [[Thomas Truxtun]] had been sent to patrol between [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Saint Kitts]] with orders to engage any French forces they found in the area. While Truxtun was sailing independently of his squadron in the ''Constellation'', his [[flagship]], he met and engaged ''L'Insurgente''. After chasing the French ship through a storm, ''Constellation'' was able to force ''L'Insurgente'' into an engagement that lasted an hour and fourteen minutes before the French frigate surrendered. The French sustained heavy casualties in the action, while the numbers of American dead and wounded were low. After the action ''L'Insurgente'' was taken to Saint Kitts and commissioned into the United States Navy as {{USS|Insurgent|1799|6}}. With this and later victories, American morale soared, and Truxtun returned home to honor and praise from the American government and the public at large.

==Background==
In 1798 an [[undeclared war]] between the [[United States]] and [[France]] began due to French [[privateer]]ing attacks against American vessels. In response to the attacks, the United States government decided to go on the offensive by sending four naval [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]]s to the [[Caribbean]] with orders to seize armed French vessels and prevent privateers from attacking American ships.<ref>Palmer 1987, p. 81.</ref> One of the squadrons, under the command of Commodore [[Thomas Truxtun]], was dispatched to cruise between [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Saint Kitts]]. Truxtun's squadron consisted of his [[flagship]], the [[frigate]] {{USS|Constellation|1797|6}}, the 20-gun {{USS|Baltimore|1798|2}}, the [[brig (ship)|brig]]s {{USS|Richmond|1798|2}} and {{USS|Norfolk|1798|2}}, and the [[revenue cutter]] [[USRC Virginia (1797)|''Virginia'']].<ref>Allen 1909, p. 83.</ref> Opposing Truxtun were several French vessels based out of [[Guadeloupe]], among them a number of privateers as well as two [[French Navy|French naval]] frigates and a smaller, 20-gun [[corvette]].<ref>Palmer 1987, p. 97.</ref> One of the French frigates, the [[USS Insurgent (1799)|''L'Insurgente'']], [[sortie]]d out from Guadaloupe on 8 February, commanded by Michel-Pierre Barreaut.<ref>Cutler 2005, p. 25.</ref><ref name=Palmer,98>Palmer 1987, p. 98.</ref>

Though the 1,265-ton ''Constellation'' was officially classified by the [[United States Navy]] as a 36-gun frigate, during the Quasi-War she carried a heavier armament of 38 guns.{{#tag:ref|It was commonplace for American naval ships during the Quasi-War to carry more guns than the number in their official rating.<ref>Palmer 1987, p. 23.</ref>|name=rating|group=Note}}<ref name=Bauer9>Bauer 1991, p. 9.</ref> Consisting of twenty-eight 24-pounders on her [[main deck]] and ten 12-pounders on her [[spar deck]], ''Constellation''{{'s}} main armament had a combined [[throw-weight|throwing weight]] of {{convert|396|lbs|kg}}.{{#tag:ref|Some sources state that ''Constellation'' carried 48 guns, with twenty rather than ten 12-pounders.<ref>Roberts 1942, p. 45.</ref>|name=guns|group=Note}}<ref name=Allen,99>Allen 1909, p. 99.</ref> In contrast, ''L'Insurgente'', rated a 32-gun {{Sclass|S<U+00E9>millante|frigate}}, was armed with 40 cannons. The armament of Barreaut's 950-ton ship consisted of twenty-four 12-pounders, two 18-pounders, eight 6-pounders, four 32-pounder [[carronade]]s, and two 24-pounder carronades,<ref name=Bauer9/> totaling a combined throwing weight of only {{convert|282|lbs|kg}}. Thus although Barreaut's vessel had the advantage of more guns, Truxtun's frigate had a more powerful armament due to shot weight. In a [[boarding action]], the French frigate's crew of 409 men would have had an advantage over  the American ship's 309, but in a gunnery duel the Americans were superior.<ref name=Allen,99/>

==Battle==
[[File:DiagramofAction9Feb1799.jpg|thumb|left|A diagram of ''Constellation's'' engagement with ''L'Insurgente''|alt=A black and white map shows the frigate ''Constellation'' crossing the bow of the frigate ''L'Insurgente'' three times while the time of each event of the battle is shown above.]]
At noon on 9 February, while cruising independently, Truxtun's men sighted a frigate off the coast of [[Nevis]]. Upon approach it was evident that the vessel was flying American colors, and ''Constellation'' attempted to move closer to investigate. Unknown to Truxtun, the frigate was the French ''L'Insurgente'' under Michel-Pierre Barreaut. Nearing the still-unidentified ''L'Insurgente'', Truxtun attempted to signal her to discern her nationality by sending first British signals and then American signals. Unable to send the correct reply, ''L'Insurgente'' replaced the American colors with French and fired a gun.{{#tag:ref|Truxton claimed the ''L'Insurgente's'' shot was fired [[windward]] to signal a fight, while Barreaut claimed he ordered the shot fired to [[leeward]] to signal that he wished to communicate.<ref name=Palmer,98/>|name=firstshot|group=Note}}<ref name=Palmer,98/> Upon sighting ''Constellation'' at 12:30 p.m., Barreaut mistook the ship for a British [[corvette (ship)|corvette]] and began to flee toward the Dutch islands of [[Saba]] and [[Sint Eustatius]] in order to evade his assailant. Truxtun gave chase, but was hampered at 1:30 p.m. when the two vessels ran into a [[gale]].<ref>Allen 1909, p. 96.</ref> As a result of the storm, ''L'Insurgente'' lost her main [[topmast]] and was severely damaged, while ''Constellation'' managed to avoid significant damage and was able to close in on Barreaut.<ref name=Palmer,99>Palmer 1987, p. 99.</ref>  

Though Truxton's ship initially held an advantageous position in the wind known as the [[weather gauge]], she was over-armed, and as a result her [[leeward]] side [[Heeling (sailing)|heeled]] so much that the gunports on that side of the vessel could not be opened. Truxton decided to cede the weather gauge to the French by sailing around the ''L'Insurgente''{{'}}s leeward side and bringing the ''Constellation'' near the French frigate's [[Port and starboard|port side]]. In such a position the ''Constellation'' was disadvantaged by the wind, but was able to avoid some of the heeling effect on her guns.<ref name=Palmer,99/><ref name=Toll,117>Toll 2006, p. 117.</ref> With the ''Constellation'' approaching his frigate fast, Barreaut tried to communicate with the Americans in order to avoid a fight. The American frigate ignored the French attempt at hailing her and closed to within fifty yards of ''L'Insurgente'' before opening up on her with a [[broadside]]. Loading her cannons with [[Double-shotted|double shot]], the opening American salvo severely damaged the French frigate's [[quarterdeck]].<ref>Allen 1909, p. 97.</ref> Barreaut's vessel replied with her own broadsides that damaged ''Constellation's'' fore [[topmast]]. Midshipman David Porter stationed in the rigging of the ''Constellation{{'}}s'' damaged mast, managed to relieve pressure from it and prevented its collapse.<ref name=Toll,117/> The ''L'Insurgente'' attempted to close on the American frigate to [[boarding (attack)|board]] her. With less damage to her [[rigging]], ''Constellation'' was easily able to avoid Barreaut's attempts at boarding.<ref>Spears 1897, p. 320.</ref>

''Constellation'' crossed ''L'Insurgente''{{'}}s bow and [[Raking fire|raked]] her with a broadside. Truxtun then maneuvered ''Constellation'' to the ''L'Insurgente''{{'}}s starboard side and fired further broadsides into the French frigate, but received damage to her rigging in return.<ref>Roberts 1942, p. 47.</ref> ''Constellation'' slipped ahead of ''L'Insurgente'', again crossing her bow and raking her. Once more ''Constellation'' slipped next to ''L'Insurgente''{{'}}s leeward side and fired into her, disabling the French vessel's 18-pounder guns.<ref>Spears 1897, p. 321.</ref> ''Constellation'' crossed the frigate's bow a third time, but the French ship had by then sustained massive damage. Attempts by Barreaut's crew to repair ''L'Insurgente''{{'}}s rigging were fruitless and the French captain subsequently was forced to [[Striking the colors|strike his colors]] and surrender the vessel.<ref>Allen 1909, p. 98.</ref> The entire engagement had lasted one hour and fourteen minutes.<ref>Spears 1897, p. 322.</ref>

==Aftermath==
[[File:ConstellationVersusInsurgente.jpg|300px|right|USS ''Constellation'' chasing the ''L'Insurgente''|alt=In black and white, the frigate USS ''Constellation'' pursues the fleeing French frigate ''L'Insurgente'' in the open sea as storm clouds loom overhead.]]
The end of the action signaled the first victory for the newly formed United States Navy.<ref>Wheeler 1969, p. 6.</ref><ref>Myers 2004, p. 9.</ref> After Barreaut had struck his colors, Truxtun sent a boat over to board, identify, and take possession of the French vessel. It was only upon boarding ''L'Insurgente'' that the Americans learned the identity of their opponents. The storm and the battle had caused immense damage to the French frigate. In comparison, ''Constellation'' had suffered moderate damage to her rigging, but was otherwise still intact. French casualties included 29 killed and 41 wounded, while the Americans suffered two dead and two wounded. One American died shortly after the action ended, of wounds received from French fire; another was executed for cowardice by ''Constellation''{{'}}s Lieutenant [[Andrew Sterett]] after the man deserted his gun at the start of the action.<ref>Allen 1909, p. 100.</ref>

''Constellation'' began taking on [[prisoners of war]] from ''L'Insurgente'', but by nightfall the two ships had become separated in a storm. Left aboard ''L'Insurgente'' were the ''Constellation''{{'}}s First Lieutenant [[John Rodgers (naval officer, War of 1812)|John Rodgers]], Midshipman [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]], and 11 enlisted men, along with 170 French prisoners. The Americans were forced to sail the vessel short-handed while guarding the French prisoners. As the prisoners outnumbered their captors and no gear to secure them could be found aboard, the Frenchmen were driven into ''L'Insurgente''{{'}}s lower holds. Finally, after three nights, ''L'Insurgente'' was brought in to Saint Kitts where ''Constellation'' was waiting for her.<ref name=Spears,323>Spears 1897, p. 323.</ref> While at the American naval depot at Saint Kitts, the ''Constellation''{{'}}s troublesome 24-pounder guns were removed and replaced with 18-pounder cannons.<ref>Martin 2006, p. 29.</ref> At the American [[prize court]] in Norfolk, Virginia, ''L'Insurgente'' was condemned to be sold as a [[Prize (law)|war prize]], with the proceeds distributed to the crew of the ''Constellation''.<ref>Palmer 1987, p. 133.</ref> Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert managed to negotiate the prize award down from $120,000 to $84,000 before purchasing ''L'Insurgente'' and commissioning her in the United States Navy as the USS ''Insurgent''.<ref name=Spears,323/><ref>Palmer 1987, p. 134</ref>

For his victory over ''L'Insurgente'', Truxtun received honors both at home and abroad. When accounts of the action reached London, Truxtun was [[f<U+00EA>te]]d by the merchants there who sent him a piece of silver plate to commemorate his victory.<ref name=James,32>James 2004, p. 32.</ref>  In the United States, morale soared upon hearing of the first American victory over the French. Truxtun was cited by [[Benjamin Stoddert]], the [[Secretary of the Navy]], for his excellent conduct during the action, and songs and poems such as ''Brave Yankee Boys'' were later written about the  event.<ref>Cutler 2005, p. 22.</ref> In contrast, when Barreaut returned to France he was accused of failing to put up sufficient resistance in the engagement and was given a [[court-martial]]. Despite the accusations, he had been praised by Truxton after the action for his bravery and was acquitted during the court-martial.<ref>Troude 1867, pp. 169-170.</ref><ref>Bonnel 1961, p. 98.</ref> The French were infuriated upon hearing the results of the action because the two countries were not officially at war; Governor [[Edme <U+00C9>tienne Borne Desfourneaux]] of [[Guadeloupe]] demanded that ''Insurgent'' be returned to French control. Upon learning of the American refusal to repatriate ''Insurgent'', Desfourneaux was outraged and ordered all American vessels and property to be seized, while also declaring that a state of war existed between the United States and Guadeloupe.<ref>Allen 1909, p. 103.</ref> After continuing their cruise for a few weeks, both ''Insurgent'' and ''Constellation'' were forced to return to [[Norfolk, Virginia]], by the end of March due to the expiration of the terms of enlistment of their crews.<ref>Allen 1909, p. 104.</ref> On her next cruise ''Constellation'' dueled [[HMS Vengeance (1800)|''La Vengeance'']], though that French frigate escaped ''L'Insurgente''{{'}}s fate.<ref name=James,32/>
