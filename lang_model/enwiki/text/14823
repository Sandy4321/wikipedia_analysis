'''Jeff Peckman''' is a [[ufologist]] who gained media attention in [[2008]] <ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,359563,00.html FOXNews.com - Video Purportedly Showing Space Aliens to Be Released - Science News | Science & Technology | Technology News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and showed in [[Denver, Colorado]] a video of a purportedly living, breathing [[Extraterrestrial life|space alien]]. <ref>[http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Quirks/2008/05/29/upi_newstrack_quirks_in_the_news/6885/] "UPI NewsTrack Quirks in the News:Man claims to have footage of real E.T."

He screened the video for reporters [[May 30]] [[2008]] at [[Metropolitan State College]] in Denver, although they were not allowed to photograph the images. The three minute video showed what appeared to be a "white creature with a balloon-shaped head" and large dark eyes that appeared to blink, looking in through a window 8 feet above the ground.

The video was said to have been made by [[Stan Romanek]], [[July 17]] [[2003]], in [[Nebraska]]. A documentary including the footage is to be released later in 2008. <ref>[http://origin.denverpost.com/news/ci_9427587]  Mitchell, Kirk, "Purported alien video confab concludes."

Soon after Peckman's announcement a video appeared on [[YouTube]] that was created by Rocky Mountain Paranormal Research Society for the purpose of demonstrating the ease with which a fake alien video could be made.  Much confusion came when the video was shown on [[Larry King Live]] and was taken as the original video. <ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYn4hdz91pA YouTube - Jeff Peckman and Stan Romanek on Larry King Live<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. A second video more identical to the screenshot appeared weeks later.  However, until [[3 June]] [[2008]] there is no official confirmation by both Peckman and Romaneck about the videos leaked other than the fact that the people posting the videos were contacted by Starseed LLC and threatened with legal action.
