The resultant [[landform]] is often a very steep beach (up to 45<U+00B0>) composed of rounded [[cobble]]s, [[shingle beach|shingle]] and occasionally [[sand]]. The stones usually have an obvious [[grading]] of [[pebble]]s, from large to small, with the larger diameter stones typically arrayed at the highest beach elevations.<ref>[http://www.fettes.com/Shetland/storm%20beach.htm Characterization of a storm beach]</ref>
