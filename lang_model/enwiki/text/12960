'''Drew Pearson''' ([[December 13]], [[1897]]&ndash;[[September 1]], [[1969]]), born "Andrew Russell Pearson" in [[Evanston, Illinois]] <ref> ''Current Biography 1941'', p. 658</ref> was one of the most prominent [[United States|American]] newspaper and radio [[journalist]]s of his day. He was  best known for his [[muckraking]] syndicated newspaper column "Washington Merry-Go-Round".  

His parents were [[Paul Martin Pearson]], an English professor at [[Northwestern University]], and Edna Wolfe. When Pearson was six years of age, his father joined the faculty of [[Swarthmore College]] as professor of public speaking, and the family moved to [[Pennsylvania]], joining the [[Society of Friends]], which is affiliated with the college. After being educated at [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], Pearson attended Swarthmore (1915-1919), where he edited its student newspaper, ''The Phoenix''.

From 1919 to 1921, Pearson served with the [[American Friends Service Committee]], directing post-war rebuilding operations in [[Pe<U+0107>]], which was at that time part of [[Serbia]].  From 1921 to 1922, he lectured on the topic of Geography at the University of Pennsylvania. 

In 1923, Pearson travelled to Japan, China, New Zealand, Australia, India and Serbia, and persuaded several newspapers to buy articles about his travels.  He was also commissioned by the American "Around the World Syndicate" to produce a set of interviews entitled, "Europe's Twelve Greatest Men."

From 1925 to 1928, Pearson continued reporting on international events including strikes in China, the Geneva Naval Conference, the Pan American Conference in Havana, and the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact in Paris.

In 1929, he became the Washington correspondent for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''. But in 1931 and 1932, with Robert S. Allen, he anonymously published a book called Washington Merry-Go-Round and its sequel.  When the Sun discovered Pearson had co-authored these books, he was promptly fired.  Late in 1932, Pearson and Allen secured a contract with the Scripps-Howard syndicate, United Features, to syndicate a column called "Washington Merry-Go-Round".  It first appeared in Eleanor "Cissy" Patterson's [[Washington Herald]] on November 17, 1932.  But as World War II escalated in Europe, Pearson's strong support of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], in opposition to Patterson and the Herald's isolationist position led to an acrimonious termination of Pearson and Allen's contract with the Herald.  In [[1941]], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' picked up the contract for the Washington Merry-Go-Round.

==Radio and film==
With [[Robert S. Allen]], he co-wrote anonymously "Washington Merry-Go-Round" in 1931 and went on to write the column of the same name. In 1935-36, Allen and Pearson broadcast a 15-minute program twice a week on Mutual Broadcasting System. They continued with a 30-minute music and news show, ''Listen America'', in 1939-40, ending their partnership in 1941. Pearson continued alone on NBC with ''Drew Pearson Comments'' from 1941 to 1953 for a variety of sponsors ([[Serutan]], Nutrex, Lee Hats, Adam Hats).

In addition to radio, Drew Preason also appeared in a number of [[Hollywood]] movies such as the 1951 science fiction film ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' and [[RKO]] movie, ''[[Betrayal from the East]]'', a [[World War II]] propaganda movie. In the former film, Pearson is the only journalist who urges calm and restraint (versus the fear and paranoia evoked by his colleagues) while Washington is panicked by the escape of the alien visitor [[Klaatu (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Klaatu]].   In the latter movie, Pearson narrated, in his "now it can be told" style, an alleged expos<U+00E9> that accused [[Japanese Americans]] of being part of a Japanese conspiracy to engage in acts of terrorism and espionage.  The movie was based on  the [[1943]] best selling book [[Betrayal from the East: The Inside Story of Japanese Spies in America]] by [[Alan Hynd]].  Pearson also appeared as himself in ''[[City Across the River]]'' (1949).

In 1943 Pearson hired [[David Karr]] as his chief aide, and in 1945 [[Jack Anderson]] for the staff of his column, the "Merry-Go-Round", which Anderson took over after Pearson's death in 1969. 

Following World War II, Pearson was largely responsible for the "[[Friendship Train]]" (one of several charitable gestures that reflected his Quaker upbringing) which raised over 40 million dollars in aid for war-torn Europe.  On December 18, 1947 the much needed food, medicine, and supplies arrived in France. 

He had a role in the downfall of U.S. Congressman John Parnell Thomas and Chairman of the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1948. Thomas was later convicted of conspiracy to defraud the government for hiring friends who never worked and then depositing their paychecks into his personal accounts. Pearson was an opponent of [[McCarthyism]], and was one of the few journalists to stand up to the demagoguery of the senator from Wisconsin.  Pearson's charges against the fiercely anti-Communist [[James V. Forrestal]] were reported to have contributed to Forrestal's "mental breakdown" and resignation as [[US Secretary of Defense]].

Drew Pearson had one daughter, Ellen, in a short marriage (1925-28) to Felicia Gizycka, daughter of the newspaper scion [[Cissy Patterson]] and Count [[Joseph Gizycky]] of [[Poland]]. Thereafter, Pearson maintained a strained relationship with his former mother-in-law, and they frequently exhanged barbed comments in print. His second wife was Luvie Moore Abell, whom he married in 1936; they had no children together.

==''Washington Merry-Go-Round''==
The ''Washington Merry-Go-Round'' column started as a result of the anonymous publication in [[1931]] of the book, ''Washington Merry-Go-Round'' (New York: Horace Liveright and Co.), co-written with [[Robert S. Allen]]. The book was a collection of muckraking news items concerning key figures in public life that challenged the journalistic code of the day. In 1932, it was followed by a second book, ''More Merry-Go-Round''.  Pearson and Allen were successful enough in their books to become co-authors of the [[Print syndication|syndicated]] column, the ''Washington Merry-Go-Round'', that same year.  Allen would later be succeeded by [[Jack Anderson]] as Pearson's junior partner.  

It has been said that disclosures in Pearson's column sent four Congressmen to jail and led to the resignation of President Eisenhower's chief of staff, [[Sherman Adams]].  Pearson was the first to report the incident of General George S. Patton's slapping of a soldier.  General Douglas MacArthur sued Pearson, unsuccessfully, after Pearson accused MacArthur of lobbying for a promotion. <ref> "The Tenacious Muckracker, ''TIME'' Magazine, September 12, 1969 </ref>

At the time of Pearson's death in Washington, D.C. of a heart attack in 1969, the column was syndicated to more than 650 newspapers, more than twice as many as any other, with an estimated 60 million readers, and was famous for its investigative style of journalism.  A Harris Poll commissioned by TIME Magazine at that time showed that Pearson was America's best-known newspaper columnist at the time of his death <ref> "The Tenacious Muckracker, ''TIME'' Magazine, September 12, 1969 </ref>.  The column was continued under the byline name "Jack Anderson" .

[[American University]] Library originally received the typescript copies of the columns distributed to newspapers around the country in 1992. Since then, the library embarked upon a project to digitize the collection, making it available to researchers and journalism students around the world. Digitization of the 1953-69 content is slated to be complete in 2006. <ref>{{cite web

==Parnell Thomas affair==
Pearson was critical of some of the actions and statements of powerful [[United States Congress|U.S. Congressman]] [[J. Parnell Thomas|John Parnell Thomas]] and his methods as Chairman of the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] that saw the ultimate imprisonment of the "[[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]]". Rumors about corrupt practices on the part of Thomas were confirmed when Thomas's secretary, Helen Campbell, sent documents to Pearson which he used to expose the corruption in an [[August 4]], [[1948]] newspaper article. As a result, Thomas had to resign and was charged, tried, convicted and sent to prison.

==Criticism of Pearson==
In the early 1950s Pearson was one of the few journalists to stand up against [[McCarthyism]].  McCarthy (who once reportedly slapped or kneed Pearson in the groin, in public) referred to Karr as Pearson's "[[KGB]] handler".  Karr (''born David Katz'') had been exposed by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] in 1943 as having worked for two years on the staff of the [[Communism|Communist]] newspaper ''Daily Worker''.  In response it was asserted that Karr only joined the ''Daily Worker'' because he wanted to get into [[baseball]] games for free. The highest Karr got in the newspaper was covering home [[New York Yankees|Yankee]] games.  Another member of Pearson's staff, Andrew Older, along with his wife, was identified in 1951 as a [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] member in testimony before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee. Older's sister, [[Julia Older]], was also suspected of having spied for the [[Soviet Union]]. 

Those accusing Pearson of having been either pro-Communist or "soft on Communism" called attention not only to the affiliations of his subordinates but also to his support for policy positions and personal actions that worked to the advantage of international Communism.  He was an early and vociferous critic of the anti-Communist government of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in China.  He was responsible for publicizing the infamous [http://www.pattonhq.com/unknown/chap08.html slapping incidents] by America's most outspokenly anti-Soviet General , [[George S. Patton, Jr.]] (however, Patton was most vociferously anti-Soviet after the surrender of Nazi Germany, several years after the slapping incidents), which led to Patton's being relieved of command of the Seventh Army, and he made charges against the fiercely anti-Communist Secretary of Defense, [[James V. Forrestal]], prior to Forrestal's removal by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]].  

After Forrestal's death from a fall from a 16th-floor window of the [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]], Pearson wrote that Forrestal had attempted [[suicide]] on four previous occasions, lending credence to the conclusion that Forrestal's death had been a suicide. Pearson's claim of previous suicide attempts by Forrestal is corroborated by no known evidence and was contradicted by the testimony of  Forrestal's attending physicians at Bethesda. <ref>{{cite web

In May 1948,  Pearson leaked news in the Washington Post that the SEC and Justice Department were talking to [[Preston Tucker|Preston Thomas Tucker]] of the [[1948 Tucker Sedan|Tucker Corporation]], an automobile company in Detroit.  Pearson stated - erroneously, as it would later turn out - that the agencies would uncover financial crimes at the company.  Tucker stock dropped from $5 to $2 based on Pearson's charges.  The SEC and Justice later found Tucker and his company innocent of any wrongdoing, but the damage was done.  The Tucker Corporation was never able to recover and went out of business.  It is widely believed that Pearson's claims cost Tucker investors and 2,000 car dealers millions of dollars, and that, as a result, America lost what was perhaps the most innovative automobile of its time.

"His ill-considered falsehoods have come to the point where he is doing much harm to his own Government and to other nations.  It is a pity that anyone anywhere believes anything he writes."
--President Franklin D. Roosevelt on Pearson, in letter to General Patrick J. Hurley, August 30, 1943, cited in ''Patrick J. Hurley'', a biography by Don Lohbeck, 1956.
