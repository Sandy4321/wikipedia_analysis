The term ''atheism'' originated from the Greek {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:<U+1F04><U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03BF><U+03C2>|<U+1F04><U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03BF><U+03C2>]]}} (''atheos''), meaning "without gods", which was applied with a negative connotation to those thought to reject the [[gods]] worshipped by the larger society. With the spread of [[freethought]], [[skeptical inquiry]], and subsequent increase in [[criticism of religion]], application of the term narrowed in scope. The first individuals to identify themselves as "atheist" appeared in the 18th century. Today, about 2.3% of the world's population describes itself as atheist, while a further 11.9% is described as [[Irreligion|nonreligious]].<ref name="Britannica demographics"/> Between 64% and 65% of Japanese describe themselves as atheists, [[Agnosticism|agnostics]], or non-believers,<ref name=Zuckerman/><ref name=US_State_Dept>However, data from the [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71342.htm U.S. State Dept.] may contradict this figure, since 44% are reported as adherents of Shinto, a polytheistic religion, and information was not provided on the number of respondents identifying with multiple categories.

In early [[ancient Greek]], the adjective ''{{Transl|grc|atheos}}'' ({{lang|grc|[[:wikt:<U+1F04><U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03BF><U+03C2>|<U+1F04><U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03BF><U+03C2>]]}}, from the [[privative a|privative <U+1F00>-]] + {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:<U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03CC><U+03C2>|<U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03CC><U+03C2>]]}} "god") meant "godless". It was first used as a term of censure roughly meaning "ungodly" or "impious". In the 5th century [[Common Era|BCE]], the word began to indicate more-intentional, active godlessness  in the sense of "severing relations with the gods" or "denying the gods", instead of the earlier meaning of "impious". The term [[:wikt:<U+1F00><U+03C3><U+03B5><U+03B2><U+03AE><U+03C2>|<U+1F00><U+03C3><U+03B5><U+03B2><U+03AE><U+03C2>]] (''{{Transl|grc|aseb<U+0113>s}}'') then came to be applied against those who impiously denied or disrespected the local gods, even if they believed in other gods. Modern translations of classical texts sometimes render ''{{Transl|grc|atheos}}'' as "atheistic". As an abstract noun, there was also {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:<U+1F00><U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03CC><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03C2>|<U+1F00><U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03CC><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03C2>]]}} (''{{Transl|grc|atheot<U+0113>s}}''), "atheism". [[Cicero]] transliterated the Greek word into the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|[[:wikt:atheos#Latin|atheos]]}}''. The term found frequent use in the debate between [[early Christianity|early Christians]] and [[Ancient Greek religion|Hellenists]], with each side attributing it, in the pejorative sense, to the other.<ref name=drachmann>{{cite book |last=Drachmann |first=A.

''Atheism'' was first used to describe a self-avowed belief in late 18th-century Europe, specifically denoting disbelief in the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[Abrahamic religions#The Supreme Deity|Abrahamic god]].<ref name="adevism">In part because of its wide use in monotheistic Western society, ''atheism'' is usually described as "disbelief in God", rather than more generally as "disbelief in deities". A clear distinction is rarely drawn in modern writings between these two definitions, but some archaic uses of ''atheism'' encompassed only disbelief in the singular God, not in [[polytheism|polytheistic]] deities. It is on this basis that the obsolete term ''[[adevism]]'' was coined in the late 19th century to describe an absence of belief in plural deities. {{cite journal |author=Britannica |title=Atheonism |journal=[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]] |edition=11th Edition |year=1911}}

In the 20th century, [[globalization]] contributed to the expansion of the term to refer to disbelief in all deities, though it remains common in Western society to describe atheism as simply "disbelief in God".<ref name="mmartin">Martin, Michael.

Writers disagree how best to define and classify ''atheism'',<ref name="eb911-atheism">{{cite web |year=1911 |url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Atheism |title="Atheism" |work=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=2007-06-07}}
</ref>
contesting what supernatural entities it applies to, whether it is an assertion in its own right or merely the absence of one, and whether it requires a conscious, explicit rejection. A variety of categories have been proposed to try to distinguish the different forms of atheism.

===Range===
Some of the ambiguity and controversy involved in defining ''atheism'' arises from difficulty in reaching a consensus for the definitions of words like ''deity'' and ''god''. The plurality of wildly different [[Conceptions of God|conceptions of god]] and deities leads to differing ideas regarding atheism's applicability. The ancient Romans accused Christians of being atheists for not worshiping the [[paganism|pagan]] deities. In the 20th century, this view fell into disfavor as ''theism'' came to be understood as encompassing belief in any divinity.<ref name="mmartin"/>

With respect to the range of phenomena being rejected, atheism may counter anything from the existence of a deity, to the existence of any [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[supernatural]], or [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] concepts, such as those of Hinduism and Buddhism.<ref name="Britannica1992">{{cite journal |author=Britannica |title=Atheism as rejection of religious beliefs |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-38265/atheism |accessdate=2006-10-27 |journal=[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]] |edition=15th |volume=1 |pages=666 |year=1992 |id=0852294735}}</ref>

===Implicit vs. explicit===
{{Main|Implicit and explicit atheism}}
Definitions of atheism also vary in the degree of consideration a person must put to the idea of gods to be considered an atheist. Atheism has sometimes been defined to include the simple absence of belief that any deities exist. This broad definition would include newborns and other people who have not been exposed to theistic ideas. As far back as 1772, [[Baron d'Holbach]] said that "All children are born Atheists; they have no idea of God."<ref>{{cite book |last=d'Holbach |first=P. H. T. |authorlink=Baron d'Holbach |title=Good Sense |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/7319 |accessdate=2006-10-27 |year=1772}}
</ref>
Similarly, [[George H. Smith]] (1979) suggested that: "The man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god. This category would also include the child with the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved, but who is still unaware of those issues. The fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist."<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=14}}.
</ref>
Smith coined the term ''implicit atheism'' to refer to "the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it" and ''explicit atheism'' to refer to the more common definition of conscious disbelief.

In Western civilization, the view that children are born atheist is relatively recent. Before the 18th century, the existence of God was so universally accepted in the western world that even the possibility of true atheism was questioned. This is called ''theistic [[innatism]]''<U+2014>the notion that all people believe in God from birth; within this view was the connotation that atheists are simply in denial.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cudworth |first=Ralph |authorlink=Ralph Cudworth |title=The True Intellectual System of the Universe: the first part, wherein all the reason and philosophy of atheism is confuted and its impossibility demonstrated |year=1678}}
</ref>
There is a position claiming that atheists are quick to believe in God in times of crisis, that atheists make [[deathbed conversion]]s, or that "there are no [[atheists in foxholes]]."<ref>See, for instance, {{cite web|url=http://www.lds-mormon.com/atheist.shtml|title=Atheists call for church head to retract slur|date=1996-09-03|accessdate=2008-07-02}}
</ref>
Some proponents of this view claim that the [[anthropology of religion|anthropological benefit of religion]] is that religious faith enables humans to endure hardships better, functioning as an "[[opium of the people]]". Some atheists emphasize the fact that there have been examples to the contrary, among them examples of literal "atheists in foxholes."<ref>{{cite web |last=Lowder |first=Jeffery Jay |year=1997 |title=Atheism and Society |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jeff_lowder/society.html |accessdate=2007-01-10}}

</ref>
and [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]],<ref name="mmartin" />
have contrasted positive (strong/hard) atheism with negative (weak/soft) atheism. Positive atheism is the explicit affirmation that gods do not exist.

Under this demarcation of atheism, most agnostics qualify as negative atheists.

While [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Martin]], for example, asserts that agnosticism entails negative atheism,<ref name="mmartin"/> most agnostics see their view as distinct from atheism, which they may consider no more justified than theism or requiring an equal conviction.<ref>{{cite book |first=Anthony |last=Kenny |authorlink=Anthony Kenny |title=What I believe |chapter=Why I Am Not an Atheist |publisher=Continuum |isbn=0-8264-8971-0 |quote=The true default position is neither theism nor atheism, but agnosticism ... a claim to knowledge needs to be substantiated; ignorance need only be confessed. |year=2006}}

"Who seriously claims we should say 'I neither believe nor disbelieve that the Pope is a robot', or 'As to whether or not eating this piece of chocolate will turn me into an elephant I am completely agnostic'. In the absence of any good reasons to believe these outlandish claims, we rightly disbelieve them, we don't just suspend judgement."

and that the unprovability of a god's existence does not imply equal probability of either possibility.<ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=22}}. "A lack of proof is no grounds for the suspension of belief.

Scottish philosopher [[J. J. C.

===Other usage of the term "Positive Atheism"===

As mentioned above, the terms ''negative'' and ''positive'' have been used in philosophical literature in a similar manner to the terms ''weak'' and ''strong''. However, the book ''Positive Atheism'' by [[Goparaju Ramachandra Rao]], first published in 1972, introduced an alternative use for the phrase.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rao |first=Goparaju |authorlink=Goparaju Ramachandra Rao |title=Positive Atheism |publisher=Atheist Centre, Patamata, Vijayawada, India |year=1972 |location=Vijayawada, India}}

Positive atheism entails such things as being morally upright, showing an understanding that religious people have reasons to believe, not proselytising or lecturing others about atheism, and defending oneself with truthfulness instead of aiming to 'win' any confrontations with outspoken critics.

The broadest demarcation of atheistic rationale is between practical and theoretical atheism.
===Practical atheism===
{{Main|Apatheism}}
In ''practical'', or ''[[pragmatism|pragmatic]]'', atheism, also known as [[apatheism]], individuals live as if there are no gods and explain natural phenomena without resorting to the divine. The existence of gods is not denied, but may be designated unnecessary or useless; gods neither provide purpose to life, nor influence everyday life, according to this view.<ref name="Zdybicka-p20">{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=20}}.
</ref>
A form of practical atheism with implications for the [[scientific community]] is [[methodological naturalism]]<U+2014>the "tacit adoption or assumption of philosophical naturalism within [[scientific method]] with or without fully accepting or believing it."<ref name="neps">Schafersman, Steven D. "[http://www.freeinquiry.com/naturalism.html Naturalism is an Essential Part of Science and Critical Inquiry]". Conference on Naturalism, Theism and the Scientific Enterprise. Department of Philosophy, The University of Texas. February 1997. Revised May 2007. Retrieved on 2007-APR-09.
</ref>

Practical atheism can take various forms:
* Absence of religious motivation<U+2014>belief in gods does not motivate moral action, religious action, or any other form of action;
* Active exclusion of the problem of gods and religion from intellectual pursuit and practical action;
* Indifference<U+2014>the absence of any interest in the problems of gods and religion; or
* Unawareness of the concept of a deity.<ref>{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=21}}.
</ref>

===Theoretical atheism===
{{See|Existence of God}}

Theoretical (or theoric) atheism explicitly posits arguments against the existence of gods, responding to common [[existence of God#Arguments for the existence of God|theistic arguments]] such as the [[argument from design]] or [[Pascal's Wager]]. The theoretical reasons for rejecting gods assume various forms, above all ontological, gnoseological, and epistemological, but also sometimes psychological and sociological forms.

=====Epistemological and ontological arguments=====
{{See|Agnostic atheism|Theological noncognitivism}}
[[Epistemology|Epistemological]] atheism argues that people cannot know God or determine the existence of God. The foundation of epistemological atheism is agnosticism, which takes a variety of forms. In the philosophy of [[immanence]], divinity is inseparable from the world itself, including a person's mind, and each person's [[consciousness]] is locked in the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]. According to this form of agnosticism, this limitation in perspective prevents any objective inference from belief in a god to assertions of its existence. The [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] agnosticism of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] only accepts knowledge deduced with human rationality; this form of atheism holds that gods are not discernible as a matter of principle, and therefore cannot be known to exist. Skepticism, based on the ideas of [[David Hume|Hume]], asserts that certainty about anything is impossible, so one can never know the existence of God. The allocation of agnosticism to atheism is disputed; it can also be regarded as an independent, basic worldview.<ref name="Zdybicka-p20"/>

Other arguments for atheism that can be classified as epistemological or [[ontology|ontological]], including [[logical positivism]] and [[ignosticism]], assert the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of basic terms such as "God" and statements such as "God is all-powerful." [[Theological noncognitivism]] holds that the statement "God exists" does not express a proposition, but is nonsensical or cognitively meaningless. It has been argued both ways as to whether such individuals can be classified into some form of atheism or agnosticism. Philosophers [[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer]] and [[Theodore M. Drange]] reject both categories, stating that both camps accept "God exists" as a proposition; they instead place noncognitivism in its own category.<ref>[[Theodore Drange|Drange, Theodore M.]] (1998).

=====Metaphysical arguments=====
{{See|Monism|Physicalism}}
One author writes:
{{quote|"Metaphysical atheism... includes all doctrines that hold to metaphysical monism (the homogeneity of reality). Metaphysical atheism may be either: a) absolute <U+2014> an explicit denial of God's existence associated with materialistic monism (all materialistic trends, both in ancient and modern times); b) relative <U+2014> the implicit denial of God in all philosophies that, while they accept the existence of an absolute, conceive of the absolute as not possessing any of the attributes proper to God: transcendence, a personal character or unity. Relative atheism is associated with idealistic monism (pantheism, panentheism, deism)."<ref>{{Zdybicka, 2005.

=====Logical arguments=====
{{Further|[[Existence of God#Deductive arguments|Deductive arguments against the existence of God]], [[Problem of evil]], [[Argument from nonbelief|Divine hiddenness]]}}
Logical atheism holds that the various [[conceptions of God|conceptions of gods]], such as the [[personal god]] of Christianity, are ascribed logically inconsistent qualities. Such atheists present [[existence of God#Deductive arguments|deductive arguments]] against the existence of God, which assert the incompatibility between certain traits, such as perfection, creator-status, [[immutability (theology)|immutability]], [[omniscience]], [[omnipresence]], [[omnipotence]], [[omnibenevolence]], [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]], personhood (a personal being), nonphysicality, [[justice]] and [[mercy]].<ref>Various authors.

</ref>

[[Theodicy|Theodicean]] atheists believe that the world as they experience it cannot be reconciled with the qualities commonly ascribed to God and gods by theologians. They argue that an [[omniscience|omniscient]], [[omnipotence|omnipotent]], and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] God is not compatible with a world where there is [[problem of evil|evil]] and [[suffering]], and where divine love is [[Divine hiddenness|hidden]] from many people.<ref>[[Theodore Drange|Drange, Theodore M.]] (1996).

===Reductionary accounts of religion===

Philosophers such as [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]<ref>Feuerbach, Ludwig (1841) ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]''
</ref>
and [[Sigmund Freud]] argued that God and other religious beliefs are human inventions, created to fulfill various psychological and emotional wants or needs. This is also a view of many [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].<ref>Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught.'' Grove Press, 1974. Pages 51<U+2013>52.
</ref>
[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], influenced by the work of Feuerbach, argued that belief in God and religion are social functions, used by those in power to oppress the working class. According to [[Mikhail Bakunin]], "the idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice; it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, in theory and practice." He reversed [[Voltaire]]'s famous aphorism that if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him, writing instead that "if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish him."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bakunin/godandstate/godandstate_ch1.html |title=God and the State |accessdate=2007-04-12 |last=Bakunin |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Bakunin |year=1916 |work= |publisher=New York: Mother Earth Publishing Association}}

Recently, [[Michel Onfray]], who regards himself as part of the tradition of [[individualist anarchism]], has sought to revive this tradition as an argument for atheism, amidst modern schools of philosophy that he feels are [[Cynicism|cynical]] and [[epicurean]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==History==
{{Main|History of atheism}}

Although the term ''atheism'' originated in 16th-century [[France]],<ref name="Golding"/> ideas that would be recognized today as atheistic are documented from [[classical antiquity]] and the [[Vedic period]].

===Early Indic religion===
{{Main|Atheism in Hinduism}}
[[Atheism in Hinduism|Atheistic schools]] are found in [[Hinduism]], which is otherwise a very theistic religion. The thoroughly materialistic and anti-theistic philosophical [[C<U+0101>rv<U+0101>ka]] School that originated in [[India]] around 6th century BCE is probably the most explicitly atheistic school of philosophy in India. This branch of Indian philosophy is classified as a [[nastika|heterodox]] system and is not considered part of the six orthodox schools of Hinduism, but it is noteworthy as evidence of a materialistic movement within Hinduism.<ref>Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles A. Moore. ''A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy''. (Princeton University Press: 1957, Twelfth Princeton Paperback printing 1989) pp. 227<U+2013>249. ISBN 0-691-01958-4.
</ref>
Chatterjee and Datta explain that our understanding of C<U+0101>rv<U+0101>ka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of the ideas by other schools, and that it is not a living tradition:

<blockquote>
"Though materialism in some form or other has always been present in India, and occasional references are found in the Vedas, the Buddhistic literature, the Epics, as well as in the later philosophical works we do not find any systematic work on materialism, nor any organized school of followers as the other philosophical schools possess. But almost every work of the other schools states, for refutation, the materialistic views. Our knowledge of Indian materialism is chiefly based on these."<ref>Satischandra Chatterjee and Dhirendramohan Datta. ''An Introduction to Indian Philosophy''. Eighth Reprint Edition. (University of Calcutta: 1984). p. 55.
</ref>
</blockquote>

Other Indian philosophies generally regarded as atheistic include [[Samkhya|Classical Samkhya]] and [[Mimamsa|Purva Mimamsa]]. The rejection of a personal creator God is also seen in [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]] in India.<ref name="Joshi">{{cite journal |last=Joshi |first=L.R. |year=1966 |title=A New Interpretation of Indian Atheism |journal=Philosophy East and West |volume=16 |issue=3/4 |pages=189<U+2013>206|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0031-8221(196607%2F10)16%3A3%2F4%3C189%3AANIOIA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-S |doi=10.2307/1397540}}

Atomic materialist [[Epicurus]] (c. 341<U+2013>270 BCE) disputed many religious doctrines, including the existence of an [[afterlife]] or a [[personal god|personal deity]]; he considered the [[soul]] purely material and mortal.

There were, however, movements within this period that forwarded heterodox conceptions of the Christian God, including differing views of the nature, transcendence, and knowability of God. Individuals and groups such as [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]], [[David of Dinant]], [[Amalric of Bena]], and the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] maintained Christian viewpoints with [[pantheism|pantheistic]] tendencies. [[Nicholas of Cusa]] held to a form of [[fideism]] he called ''[[De Docta Ignorantia|docta ignorantia]]'' ("learned ignorance"), asserting that God is beyond human categorization, and our knowledge of God is limited to conjecture. [[William of Ockham]] inspired anti-metaphysical tendencies with his [[nominalism|nominalistic]] limitation of human knowledge to singular objects, and asserted that the divine [[essence]] could not be intuitively or rationally apprehended by human intellect. Followers of Ockham, such as [[John of Mirecourt]] and [[Nicholas of Autrecourt]] furthered this view. The resulting division between faith and reason influenced later theologians such as [[John Wycliffe]], [[Jan Hus]], and [[Martin Luther]].<ref name="Zdybicka 2005 4"/>

The [[Renaissance]] did much to expand the scope of freethought and skeptical inquiry. Individuals such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] sought experimentation as a means of explanation, and opposed [[Appeal to authority|arguments from religious authority]]. Other critics of religion and the Church during this time included [[Niccol<U+00F2> Machiavelli]], [[Bonaventure des P<U+00E9>riers]], and [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Rabelais]].<ref name="gordonstein"/>

===Early modern period===
The [[Renaissance]] and [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] eras witnessed a resurgence in religious fervor, as evidenced by the proliferation of new religious orders, confraternities, and popular devotions in the Catholic world, and the appearance of increasingly austere Protestant sects such as the [[Calvinists]]. This era of interconfessional rivalry permitted an even wider scope of theological and philosophical speculation, much of which would later be used to advance a religiously skeptical world-view.

[[Criticism of Christianity]] became increasingly frequent in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and England, where there appears to have been a religious [[malaise]], according to contemporary sources. Some Protestant thinkers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], espoused a materialist philosophy and skepticism toward supernatural occurrences, while the Jewish-Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] rejected [[divine providence]] in favour of a pantheistic naturalism.  By the late 17th century, [[Deism]] came to be openly espoused by intellectuals such as [[John Toland (Irish Philosopher)|John Toland]]. Despite their ridicule of Christianity, many Deists held atheism in scorn. The first known atheist who threw off the mantle of deism, bluntly denying the existence of gods, was [[Jean Meslier]], a French priest who lived in the early 18th century.<ref>[http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue40/Onfray40.htm Michel Onfray on Jean Meslier] on William Paterson University accessed at January 19, 2008
</ref>
He was followed by other openly atheistic thinkers, such as [[Baron d'Holbach]] and [[Jacques-Andr<U+00E9> Naigeon]].<ref>{{cite book |last=d'Holbach |first=P. H. T. |authorlink=Baron d'Holbach |title=The system of nature |url=http://fulltextarchive.com/pages/The-System-of-Nature-Vol-21.php |accessdate=2007-10-31 |year=1770}}
</ref>
The philosopher [[David Hume]] developed a skeptical epistemology grounded in empiricism, undermining the metaphysical basis of natural theology.
[[Image:Feuerbach Ludwig.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]'s ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841) would greatly influence philosophers such as [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[David Strauss]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[Max Stirner]]. He considered God to be a human invention and religious activities to be wish-fulfillment.]]
The [[French Revolution]] took atheism outside the salons and into the public sphere. Attempts to enforce the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] led to anti-clerical violence and the expulsion of many clergy from France. The chaotic political events in revolutionary Paris eventually enabled the more radical [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]] to seize power in 1793, ushering in the [[Reign of Terror]]. At its climax, the more militant atheists attempted to forcibly de-Christianize France, replacing religion with a [[Cult of Reason]]. These persecutions ended with the [[Thermidorian Reaction]], but some of the secularizing measures of this period remained a permanent legacy of French politics.

The [[Napoleonic era]] institutionalized the secularization of French society, and exported the revolution to northern Italy, in the hopes of creating pliable republics. In the 19th century, atheists contributed to political and social revolution, facilitating the [[Revolutions of 1848|upheavals of 1848]], the [[Italian unification|Risorgimento]] in Italy, and the growth of an international [[socialism|socialist]] movement.

In the latter half of the 19th century, atheism rose to prominence under the influence of [[rationalism|rationalistic]] and [[freethought|freethinking]] philosophers. Many prominent German philosophers of this era denied the existence of deities and were critical of religion, including [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Max Stirner]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=BKz2FcDrFy0C&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=nietzsche+schopenhauer+marx+feuerbach&ots=Uj5_B0kDbS&sig=1lXbokGVRbwxqAIbmcOwL033N88 |title=Subjectivity and Irreligion: Atheism and Agnosticism in Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |accessdate=2007-04-12 |last=Ray |first=Matthew Alun |year=2003}}

===Late modern period===
{{See also|New Atheism}}
Atheism in the 20th century, particularly in the form of practical atheism, advanced in many societies. Atheistic thought found recognition in a wide variety of other, broader philosophies, such as [[existentialism]], [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|objectivism]], [[secular humanism]], [[nihilism]], [[anarchism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Marxism]], [[feminism]],<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=tAeFipOVx4MC&pg=PA233&lpg=PA233&dq=%22Feminism+and+Atheism%22&source=bl&ots=Kgw9FbrS2_&sig=M9ENrKZE1i-5TDqc-ekuEWvONv8&hl=en&ei=7AvnS5G1IYfOM5mipYQI&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22Feminism%20and%20Atheism%22&f=false |last=Overall |first=Christine |title=Feminism and Atheism}} in {{harvnb|Martin|2007|pp=233<U+2013>246}}

and the general scientific and [[rationalist movement]].

Logical positivism and [[scientism]] paved the way for [[neopositivism]], [[analytical philosophy]], [[structuralism]], and [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. Neopositivism and analytical philosophy discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological [[nominalism]]. Proponents such as [[Bertrand Russell]] emphatically rejected belief in God. In his early work, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse. [[A. J. Ayer]] asserted the unverifiability and meaninglessness of religious statements, citing his adherence to the empirical sciences. Relatedly the applied [[structuralism]] of [[Claude L<U+00E9>vi-Strauss|L<U+00E9>vi-Strauss]] sourced religious language to the human subconscious in denying its transcendental meaning. [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J. N. Findlay]] and [[J. J. C. Smart]] argued that the existence of God is not logically necessary. Naturalists and materialistic monists such as [[John Dewey]] considered the natural world to be the basis of everything, denying the existence of God or immortality.<ref name="stanford"/><ref>{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=16}}
</ref>

The 20th century also saw the political advancement of atheism, spurred on by interpretation of the works of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]. After the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] of 1917, increased religious freedom for minority religions lasted for a few years, before the policies of [[Stalinism]] turned towards repression of religion. The [[Soviet Union]] and other [[communist state]]s promoted [[state atheism]] and opposed religion, often by violent means.<ref>{{cite book|last=Solzhenitsyn |first=Aleksandr I.|title=The Gulag Archipelago|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|isbn=0-06-000776-1|year=2002}}

An inverse [[correlation]] between [[religiosity and intelligence]] has been found by 39 studies carried out between 1927 and 2002, according to an article in ''[[Mensa International|Mensa]] Magazine''.<ref>According to Dawkins (2006), p. 103. Dawkins cites Bell, Paul. "Would you believe it?" ''Mensa Magazine'', UK Edition, Feb. 2002, pp. 12<U+2013>13. Analyzing 43 studies carried out since 1927, Bell found that all but four reported such a connection, and he concluded that "the higher one's intelligence or education level, the less one is likely to be religious or hold 'beliefs' of any kind."

The strictest sense of positive atheism does not entail any specific beliefs outside of disbelief in any deity; as such, atheists can hold any number of spiritual beliefs. For the same reason, atheists can hold a wide variety of ethical beliefs, ranging from the [[moral universalism]] of [[humanism]], which holds that a moral code should be applied consistently to all humans, to [[moral nihilism]], which holds that morality is meaningless.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|pp=21<U+2013>22}}
</ref>

Although it is a philosophical truism, encapsulated in Plato's [[Euthyphro dilemma]] that the role of the gods in determining right from wrong is either unnecessary or arbitrary, [[Divine command theory|the argument that morality must be derived from God]] and cannot exist without a wise creator has been a persistent feature of political if not so much philosophical debate.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=275}}. "Among the many myths associated with religion, none is more widespread -or more disastrous in its effects -than the myth that moral values cannot be divorced from the belief in a god."
</ref><ref>
In [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (Book Eleven: ''Brother Ivan Fyodorovich'', Chapter 4) there is the famous argument that ''If there is no God, all things are permitted.'': "'But what will become of men then?' I asked him, 'without God and immortal life? All things are lawful then, they can do what they like?'"
</ref><ref name="Kant CPR A811">
For [[Kant]], the presupposition of God, soul, and freedom was a practical concern, for "Morality, by itself, constitutes a system, but happiness does not, unless it is distributed in exact proportion to morality. This, however, is possible in an intelligible world only under a wise author and ruler. Reason compels us to admit such a ruler, together with life in such a world, which we must consider as future life, or else all moral laws are to be considered as idle dreams..." (''Critique of Pure Reason'', A811).
</ref>
Moral precepts such as "murder is wrong" are seen as [[divine law]]s, requiring a divine lawmaker and judge. However, many atheists argue that treating morality legalistically involves a [[false analogy]], and that morality does not depend on a lawmaker in the same way that laws do.<ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=38}}

</ref>
(among others) assert that behaving ethically only because of divine mandate is not true ethical behavior but merely blind obedience. Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves&nbsp;<U+2014> to be able to discern, for example, that "thou shalt steal" is immoral even if one's religion instructs it&nbsp;<U+2014> and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations.<ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=43}}

The contemporary British political philosopher Martin Cohen has offered the more historically telling example of Biblical injunctions in favour of torture and slavery as evidence of how religious injunctions follow political and social customs, rather than vice versa, but also noted that the same tendency seems to be true of supposedly dispassionate and objective philosophers.<ref>101 Ethical Dilemmas, 2nd edition, by Cohen, M., Routledge 2007, pp184-5. (Cohen notes particularly that Plato and Aristotle produced arguments in favour of slavery.)
</ref>
Cohen extends this argument in more detail in ''Political Philosophy from Plato to Mao'' in the case of the [[Koran]] which he sees as having had a generally unfortunate role in preserving medieval social codes through changes in secular society.<ref>Political Philosophy from Plato to Mao, by Cohen, M, Second edition 2008
