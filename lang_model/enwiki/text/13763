The '''Iranian peoples''' are a collection of [[ethnic group]]s defined by their usage of [[Iranian languages]] and discernable descent from [[ancient Iranian peoples]].<ref name="Kurds"> [http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2002/issue4/oleary.pdf "The Kurds of Iraq: Recent History, Future Prospects by Carole A.

The series of ethnic groups which comprise the Iranian peoples are traced to a branch of the ancient [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] [[Aryan]]s known as the ''Iranians'' or ''Proto-Iranians''. Some scant information about the way of life of these early people has been elucidated through archaeological finds in [[Russia]], Central Asia and the Middle East. The Iranian peoples have played an important role throughout history: the [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenid]] [[Persian Empire|Persians]] established the world's first multi-national state, and the [[Scythia]]n-[[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] nomads dominated the vast expanses of Russia and western [[Siberia]] for centuries and gave birth to the infamous [[Amazons]]. In addition, the various religions of the Iranian peoples, including [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Manichaeism]], were important early philosophical influences on [[Judeo-Christian]]ity. Early Iranian tribes were the precursors to many diverse modern peoples, including the [[Persian people|Persians]], the [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], the [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]], and many other, smaller groups. The southern Iranian peoples survived [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquests, [[Muslim]] [[Arab]] attempts at cultural dominance, and devastating assaults by the [[Mongols]], whereas the Iranians of the north were largely assimilated by the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] and other European peoples.

==Etymology and usage==
The term ''Iranian'' is derived from ''Iran'' (''lit'': "Land of the [[Aryan]]s").<ref name="Farsinet"> [http://www.farsinet.com/farsi/ "Farsi-Persian language"] <U+2014> Farsi.net (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref><ref name="1911 Encyclopedia"> [http://58.1911encyclopedia.org/I/IR/IRAN.htm "Iran"] <U+2014> The 1911 Encyclopedia (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref> The old [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] term ''Arya'', meaning "noble", is believed to have been one of a series of self-referential terms used by the Aryans, at least in the areas populated by Aryans who migrated south from [[Central Asia]] and southern [[Russia]]. Their ancient homeland was referred to as ''[[Airyanem Vaejah]]'' and varied in its geographic range, sometimes referring to [[Fars]] (according to [[Eratosthenes]]), sometimes to the area around [[Herat]] ([[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s view), sometimes to the entire expanse of the [[Iranian plateau]] ([[Strabo]]'s designation).<ref>[http://58.1911encyclopedia.org/I/IR/IRAN.htm Ibid.]</ref>

From a '''linguistic''' standpoint, the term ''Iranian peoples'' is similar in its usage to the term ''[[Germanic peoples]]'', which includes various peoples who happen to speak [[Germanic languages]] such as [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], or the term ''[[Slavic peoples]]'', which includes various speakers of [[Slavic languages]] including [[Russians]], [[Bosniaks]], and [[Serbs]].<ref name="ISBNMallory"> ''In Search of the Indo-Europeans'', by J.P. Mallory, p. 22-23, ISBN 0-500-27616-1 (retrieved [[10 June]] [[2006]])</ref> Thus, along similar lines, the Iranian peoples include not only the [[Persian people|Persians]], or [[Tajiks]], of [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikistan]], but also the [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]], [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], [[Ossetians]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]], and a number of other groups. The academic usage of the term ''Iranian peoples'', or ''Iranic peoples'', is thus distinct from the state of [[Iran]] and its various citizens (who are all Iranian by nationality, and thus popularly referred to as ''Iranians''), in the same way that ''Germanic peoples'' is distinct from ''[[Germans]]''. Many citizens of Iran are not necessarily "Iranian peoples", by virtue of not being speakers of Iranian languages, and may not have discernable ties to ancient Iranian tribes.

===Roots===
[[Image:BMAC.png|thumb|220px|The extent of the [[Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex|BMAC]] (after the [[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture|EIEC]]).]]

Having descended from the [[Aryan#Indo-Iranian|Aryans]] (Proto-[[Indo-Iranian]]s), the ancient Iranian peoples separated from the [[Indo-Aryans]], [[Nuristani]]s and [[Dard people|Dards]] in the early 2nd millennium BCE. The [[Iranian languages]] form a sub-branch of the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] sub-family, which is a branch of the family of [[Indo-European languages]].<ref name="Ethnologue"> [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90019 "Report for Iranian languages"] <U+2014> Ethnologue (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref> The Iranian peoples stem from early Proto-Iranians, themselves a branch of the [[Indo-Iranians]], who are believed to have originated in either [[Central Asia]] or [[Afghanistan]] circa 1800 BCE. The Proto-Iranians are traced to the [[Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex]], a [[Bronze Age]] culture of Central Asia. The area between northern Afghanistan and the [[Aral Sea]] is hypothesized to have been the region where the Proto-Iranians first emerged, following the separation of Indo-Iranians tribes.<ref name="Panshin"> [http://www.panshin.com/trogholm/wonder/indoeuropean/indoeuropean3.html "The Paleolithic Indo-Europeans"] <U+2014> Panshin.com (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref>

By the first millennium BCE, [[Ancient Iranian peoples]] such as the [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Bactria]]ns and [[Parthia]]ns populated the [[Iranian plateau]], while Iranian peoples such as the Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans populated the steppes north of the [[Black Sea]]. The [[Saka]] and [[Scythia]]n tribes remained mainly in the north, and spread as far west as the [[Balkans]] and as far east as [[Xinjiang]]. Later offshoots, related to the Scythians, included the [[Sarmatians]], who vanished following [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and other invasions into southern Russia, the [[Ukraine]], and the Balkans, presumably due to having been assimilated by other tribes.<ref name="Iranologie"> [http://www.iranologie.com/history/history2.html "History of Iran-Chapter 2 Indo-Europeans and Indo-Iranians"] <U+2014> Iranologie (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref> 

There are only scant references to these early Proto-Iranian invaders in the early writings of the ancient [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Babylonia]]ns. Two of the early offshoots of the Proto-Iranians are known: [[Avestan language|Avestan]] speakers in Afghanistan, and [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] speakers in [[Fars]] in southeastern Iran. The Avestan texts known as the [[Gathas]] are believed to have been written by [[Zoroaster]], the founder of [[Zoroastrianism]], while Old Persian appears to have been established in written form following the adoption of [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] from the [[Sumer]]ians.<ref name="Lubotsky"> [http://www.ieed.nl/lubotsky/pdf/avestan%20xvarnah.pdf "The Avestan, etymology and concept by Alexander Lubotsky"] <U+2014> Sprache und Kultur. Akten der X. Fachtagung der Indogermanischen Gesellschaft, 22.-28. September 1996, ed. W. Meid, Innsbruck (IBS) 1998, 479-488. (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref> The [[Yaz culture]] (ca. 1500-1100 BC) may mark the development of [[Eastern Iranian]] and the emergence of [[Avestan]] culture.

The first mentioning by an Iranian tribe of their "Aryan" lineage is from an early inscription known as the [[Behistun Inscription]], recording a proclamation by [[Darius I of Persia]] that he was of Aryan ancestry and that his language was an Aryan language. The inscription thus provides a link in the Iranian languages to the usage of the term ''Arya'' in early [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] texts.<ref name="Art Arena"> [http://www.art-arena.com/oldlit.htm "Old Iranian literature"] <U+2014> Art Arena. (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref> These ancient Persians recognized three official languages ([[Elamite language|Elamite]], [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]], and [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]]), which suggests a [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] society.<ref name="CAIS"> [http://www.cais-soas.com/CAIS/History/hakhamaneshian/darius_great.htm "Darius I the Great by Prof. A. Shapur Shahbazi"] <U+2014> Circle of Iranian Studies. (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref> It is not known to what extent other Proto-Iranian tribes referred to themselves as "Aryan", or if the term has the same meaning in other Old Iranian languages.

====Eastern Iranians====
While the Iranian tribes of the south are better known through their modern counterparts, the tribes which remained largely in the vast Eurasian expanse are known through the references made to them by the ancient Greeks and Persians, as well as by archaeological finds. In the 5th century BCE, [[Herodotus]] made references to a nomadic people whom he identifies as the [[Scythia]]ns and describes as having dwelt in what is today southern [[Russia]].

[[Image:PazyrikHorseman.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Scythia]]n Horseman, ''[[Pazyryk]]'' felt artifact, c. 300 BCE.]]

It is believed that these Scythians were conquered by their eastern cousins, the [[Sarmatians]], who are mentioned by [[Strabo]] as the dominant tribe which controlled the southern Russian steppe by the 1st millennium CE. These Sarmatians were also known to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who conquered the western tribes in the Balkans and sent Sarmatian conscripts, as part of Roman legions, as far west as [[Roman Britain]]. Some tribes of Sarmatians are also identified as the [[Amazons]] of Greek legend, warrior women believed to have lived in a [[matrilineality|matrilineal]] society in which both men and women took part in war, and whose existence has been supported by recently-uncovered archaeological and genetic evidence.<ref name="Amazons"> [http://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/case_amazon/index.html "Secrets of the Dead, Amazon Warrior Women"] <U+2014> PBS. (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref>

The Sarmatians of the east became the [[Alans]], who also ventured far and wide, with a branch ending up in [[Western Europe]] and [[North Africa]], as they accompanied the Germanic [[Vandals]] during their migrations. The modern [[Ossetians]] are believed to be the sole direct descendants of the Alans, as other remnants of the Alans disappeared following Germanic, [[Huns|Hunnic]], and ultimately Slavic invasions.<ref name="ISBN"> A History of Russia by Nicholas Riasanovsky, pp. 11-18, Russia before the Russians, ISBN 0-19-515394-4 (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref>

Some of the Saka-Scythian tribes in Central Asia would later move further south and invade the [[Iranian plateau]] and northwestern [[India]] (see [[Indo-Scythians]]). Another Iranian tribe related to the Saka-Scythians were the [[Parni]] in Central Asia, a tribe that pressured, and ultimately overthrew, the rule of the Greek [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] in Persia. The Parni replaced the Seleucids as the [[Parthia]]ns, a dynasty that ruled Persia during the early centuries of the 1st millennium CE and became the main rival of the [[Roman Empire]] in the east. It is surmised that many Iranian tribes, including the [[Khwarezm|Khwarezmians]], [[Massagetae]] and [[Sogdiana|Sogdians]], were assimilated and/or pushed out of Central Asia by the migrations of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribes emanating out of Siberia.<ref name="Kimball"> [http://www.thirteen.org/pressroom/release.php?get=1272 "Jeannine Davis-Kimball, Archaeologist"] <U+2014> Thirteen WNET New York. (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref>

The most dominant surviving Eastern Iranians are represented by the [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]], whose origins are generally believed to be in southern Afghanistan, from which they began to spread until they reached as far west as [[Herat]] and as far east as the [[Indus River|Indus]]. The [[Pashto language]] shows affinities to [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]], as both languages are believed to be of [[Iranian languages#The Middle Iranian languages|Middle Iranian]] origin. The modern [[Ossetians]] claim to be the descendants of the Alano-Sarmatians, and their claims are supported by their Northeast Iranian language, while culturally the Ossetians resemble their Caucasian neighbors, the [[Kabard]]ians, [[Circassians]] and [[Georgian people|Georgians]].<ref name="ISBN">From Scythia to Camelot by Littleton and Malcor, pp. 40-43, ISBN 0-8153-3566-0 (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref> Various extinct Iranian peoples existed in the eastern Caucasus, including the [[Ancient Azari language|Azaris]], while some Iranian peoples remain in the region, including the [[Talysh people|Talysh]]<ref name="Talysh"> [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=tly "Report for Talysh"] <U+2014> Ethnologue.

====Western Iranians====
[[Image:Scythia-Parthia 100 BC.png|thumb|240px|right|Geographical extent of Iranian influence in the 1st century BCE. The [[Parthia]]n Empire (mostly [[Western Iranian languages|Western Iranian]]) is shown in red, other areas, dominated by [[Scythia]] (mostly [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian]]), in orange.]]

The ancient Persians established themselves in the western portion of the Iranian plateau, and appear to have interacted considerably with the Elamites and Babylonians, while the Medes also intermingled with local [[Semitic]] peoples to the west. Remnants of the [[Median language]] and Old Persian show their common Proto-Iranian roots, emphasized in Strabo and Herodotus' analyses of their languages, which they believed to be very similar to the languages spoken by the Bactrians and [[Sogdiana|Soghdians]] in the east.<ref name="Geo Strabo"> [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2A1*.html "The Geography of Strabo"] <U+2014> University of Chicago. (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref><ref name="1911 Encyclopedia"> [http://58.1911encyclopedia.org/I/IR/IRAN.htm "Iran"] <U+2014> The 1911 Encyclopedia (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref> Following the establishment of the [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenid Empire]], the Persian language spread from [[Fars]] to various regions of the empire, with the modern dialects of Iran, Afghanistan (also known as [[Dari]]) and Central-Asia (known as [[Tajik language|Tajiki]]) descending from Old Persian.

The Avestans' main impact was religious and liturgical, as the early inhabitants of the Persian Empire appear to have adopted the religion of [[Zoroastrianism]]. The other prominent Iranian peoples, such as the Kurds, are surmised to stem from Iranic populations that mixed with Caucasian peoples such as the [[Hurrians]], due to some unique qualities found in the Kurdish language that mirror those found in [[languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian languages]].<ref name="Edinburgh"> [http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~siamakr/Kurdish/iran-lang.html "Kurdish: An Indo-European Language By Siamak Rezaei Durroei"] <U+2014> University of Edinburgh, School of Informatics. (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref> The [[Baloch people|Baloch]] relate an oral tradition regarding their migration from [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]] around the year 1000 CE, whereas linguistic evidence links [[Balochi language|Balochi]] to [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] and [[Zazaki language|Zazaki]].<ref name="Rezakhani">[http://www.iranologie.com/history/ilf.html "The Iranian Language Family, Khodadad Rezakhani"] <U+2014> Iranologie. (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref>

===Later developments===
In ancient times, the majority of southern Iranian peoples became adherents of Zoroastrianism, [[Buddhism]] (in parts of Afghanistan and Central Asia), [[Judaism]] and [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] [[Christianity]] (largely amongst the Kurds and Persians living in Iraq).<ref name="ISBN 2"> The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates by Hugh Kennedy, pp. 12-13, ISBN 0-582-40525-4 (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref> The Ossetians would later adopt Christianity as well, with [[Russian Orthodoxy]] becoming dominant following their annexation into the [[Russian Empire]], while some converted to Islam due to the influence of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]].

[[Image:Salahaddin.jpg|thumb|150px|left|A statue of [[Saladin]] "king of Egypt" at the [[Damascus]] citadel.]]

Starting with the reign of [[Omar]] in 634 CE, [[Muslim]] [[Arab]]s began a conquest of the Iranian plateau. The Arabs conquered the [[Sassanid Empire]] of the Persians and seized much of the [[Byzantine Empire]] populated by the Kurds and others. Ultimately, the various Iranian peoples, including the Persians, Kurds and Pashtuns, were converted to [[Islam]]. The Iranian peoples would later split along sectarian lines as the Persians (and later the [[Hazara]]) adopted the [[SHIA Islam|Shi'a]] sect, while the majority of other Iranian peoples remained adherents of [[Sunni Islam]]. As ancient tribes and identities changed, so did the Iranian peoples, many of whom assimilated foreign cultures and peoples.<ref>Ibid. p. 135</ref>

Later, during the 2nd millennium CE, the Iranian peoples would play a prominent role during the age of Islamic expansion and empire. [[Saladin]], a noted adversary of the [[Crusade]]rs, was an ethnic Kurd, while various empires centered in Iran (including the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]]) re-established a modern dialect of Persian as the official language spoken throughout much of what is today Iran and adjacent parts of Central Asia. Iranian influence spread to the Ottoman Empire, where Persian was often spoken at court, as well as in the [[Mughal Empire]], which began in Afghanistan and shifted to India. All of the major Iranian peoples reasserted their use of Iranian languages following the decline of Arab rule, but would not begin to form modern [[nationalism|national]] identities until the 19th and early 20th centuries (just as Germans and Italians were beginning to formulate national identities of their own).

==Demographics==
[[Image:Moderniranianlanguagesmap.jpg|thumb|325px|right|Geographic distribution of the Iranian languages: Persian (green), Pashto (purple), and Kurdish (turquoise), as well as smaller communities of other Iranian languages]]

{{see also|Iranian plateau}}

There are an estimated 150 million native speakers of Iranian languages. Currently, most of these Iranian peoples live in [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]], western-[[Pakistan]], parts of [[Uzbekistan]] (especially [[Samarkand]] and [[Bukhara]]), the [[Caucasus]] ([[Ossetia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]), and the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] areas (sometimes referred to as [[Kurdistan]]) of [[Turkey]], [[Iraq]], Iran and [[Syria]]. Smaller groups of Iranian peoples can also be found in western [[Xinjiang|China]], [[India]] and [[Israel]].

Due to recent migrations, there are also Persian, Kurdish and Afghan communities in Europe and the [[Americas]].

==Diversity==
It is largely through linguistic similarities that the Iranian peoples have been linked, as many non-Iranian peoples have adopted Iranian languages and cultures. However, other common traits have been identified as well, and a stream of common historical events have often linked the southern Iranian peoples, including [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] conquests, the various empires based in [[Persian Empire|Persia]], Arab [[Caliph]]ates, and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] invasions.

Although most of the Iranian peoples settled in the [[Greater Iran|Iranian plateau]] region, many expanded into the periphery, ranging from the [[Caucasus]] and [[Turkey]] to the [[Indus River|Indus]] and western [[Xinjiang|China]]. The Iranian peoples have often mingled with other populations, with the notable example being the [[Hazara]]s, who display a distinct [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]]-[[Mongols|Mongol]] background that contrasts with most other Iranian peoples.<ref name="Hazara"> [http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-40.html "Afghanistan - Hazara"] <U+2014> Library of Congress Country Studies (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref> Similarly, the [[Baloch people|Baloch]] have mingled with the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]]-speaking [[Brahui people|Brahui]] (who have been strongly modified by Iranian invaders themselves), while the [[Ossetians]] have invariably mixed with [[Georgian people|Georgians]] and other Caucasian peoples. Moreover, the Kurds are an eclectic Iranian people who, although displaying some ethnolinguistic ties to other Iranian peoples (in particular their [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]], and some cultural traits), are believed to have mixed with Caucasian and Semitic peoples.<ref name="Kurdish Genes"> [http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kurds.pdf "MtDNA and Y-chromosome Variation in Kurdish Groups"] <U+2014> Annals of Human Genetics (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref><ref name="Edinburgh"> [http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~siamakr/Kurdish/iran-lang.html "Kurdish: An Indo-European Language By Siamak Rezaei Durroei"] <U+2014> University of Edinburgh, School of Informatics. (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref> Modern Persians themselves are also a heterogeneous group of peoples descended from various ancient Iranian and indigenous peoples of the Iranian plateau, including the [[Elam]]ites.<ref name="ISBNFrye"> ''The Golden Age of Persia'', by Richard Frye, ISBN 1-84212-011-5 (retrieved [[11 June]] [[2006]])</ref> Thus, not unlike the [[#Etymology and usage|aforementioned example]] of Germanic peoples including the [[English people|English]], who are both of Germanic and [[Celt]]ic origin, Iranians are an ethno-linguistic group, and the Iranian peoples display varying degrees of common ancestry and cultural traits that denote their respective identities.

==Culture and assimilation==
{{see also|Proto-Indo-European society|Indo-Iranian mythology|Iranian philosophy}}

[[Image:Persian local woman.jpg|left|thumb|120px|Iranian model displaying traditional attire.]]

Many of the cultural traits of the ancient Iranians were similar to other [[Proto-Indo-European]] societies. Like other Indo-Europeans, the early Iranians practiced ritual sacrifice, had a social hierarchy consisting of warriors, clerics, and farmers, and poetic hymns and sagas to recount their deeds.<ref name="ISBNMallory"> ''In Search of the Indo-Europeans'', by J.P. Mallory, p. 112-127, ISBN 0-500-27616-1 (retrieved [[10 June]] [[2006]])</ref>

Following the Iranian split from the [[Indo-Iranians]], the Iranians developed an increasingly distinct culture. It is surmised that the early Iranians intermarried with and [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] local cultures over a long period of time, and thus a [[caste]] identity was never needed or created by the Iranians&mdash;in sharp contrast with the [[Indo-Aryans]].<ref>Ibid.</ref>

Various common traits can be discerned amongst the Iranian peoples. For example, the social event [[Norouz]] is an Iranian festival that is practiced by nearly all of the Iranian peoples as well as others in the region. Its origins are traced to [[Zoroastrianism]] and pre-historic times.

Some Iranian peoples exhibit distinct traits that are unique unto themselves. The Pashtuns adhere to a code of honor and culture known as [[Pashtunwali]], which has a similar counterpart amongst the [[Baloch people|Baloch]], called Mayar, that is more hierarchical.<ref name="Baloch"> [http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-9802.html "Pakistan - Baloch"] <U+2014> Library of Congress Country Studies (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref>

===Religion===
{{see also|Historical Shi'a-Sunni relations}}
[[Image:Mazar-e sharif - Steve Evans.jpg|thumb|230px|right|[[Mazari Sharif]]'s [[Rawze-e-Sharif|Blue Mosque]] in [[Afghanistan]] is a structure of cobalt blue and turquoise minarets, attracting visitors and pilgrims from all over the world. Many such Muslim [[Iranian architecture|architectural]] monuments can be attributed to the efforts of the Iranian peoples who are predominantly followers of Islam today.]]

The early Iranian peoples may have worshipped various deities found throughout other cultures where [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] invaders established themselves.<ref name="Iranologie"> [http://www.iranologie.com/history/history2.html "History of Iran-Chapter 2 Indo-Europeans and Indo-Iranians"] <U+2014> Iranologie (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref> The earliest major religion of the Iranian peoples was [[Zoroastrianism]], which spread to nearly all of the Iranian peoples living in the Iranian plateau.

Modern speakers of Iranian languages mainly follow [[Islam]]. Some follow [[Persian Jews|Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith]], with an unknown number showing no religious affiliation. Of the Muslim Iranian peoples, the majority overall are followers of the [[Sunni]] sect of Islam, while most Persians and Hazaras are [[Shi'a]]. Shi'a Islam and Sufism in Iran are both thought to be affected by [[Persianism]]. The Christian community is largely represented by the [[Russian Orthodox]] denomination, followed by Ossetians and [[Nestorians]]. [[Judaism]] is followed mainly by [[Persian Jews]], [[Jews of Afghanistan]], [[Kurdish Jews]], and [[Mountain Jews]] (of the Caucasus), most of which are now found in [[Israel]]. The historical religion of the Persian Empire was Zoroastrianism and it has some followers. They are known as the [[Parsi]]s in India, or [[Zoroastrians in Iran]] and Pakistan.

===Turkic influence===
In matters relating to culture, the various [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking minorities of Iran (notably the [[Azerbaijani people]]) and Afghanistan ([[Uzbeks]] and [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]]) are often conversant in Iranian languages, in addition to their own Turkic languages, and also have Iranian culture to the extent that the term ''Turko-Iranian'' can be applied.<ref name="ISBN 3"> Turko-Persia in Historical Perspective, edited by Robert Canfield, ISBN 0-521-52291-9 (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref> The usage applies to various circumstances that involve historic interaction, intermarriage, cultural assimilation, bilingualism, and cultural overlap or commonalities.

Notable amongst this synthesis of Turko-Iranian culture are the Azeris, whose culture, religion, and significant periods of history are linked to the Persians.<ref name="Belfer"> [http://bcsia.ksg.harvard.edu/publication.cfm?program=CSP&ctype=event_reports&item_id=50 "Azerbaijan-Iran Relations: Challenges and Prospects"] <U+2014> Harvard University, Belfer Center, Caspian Studies Program (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref> Certain theories even suggest that the Azeris are descendants of [[ancient Iranian peoples]] who lost their Iranian language (see [[Ancient Azari language]]) following the Turkic invasions of Azerbaijan in the 11th century CE. In fact, throughout much of the expanse of Central Asia and the Middle East, Iranian and Turkic culture has merged in many cases to form various hybrid populations and cultures, as evident from various ruling dynasties such as the [[Ghaznavid Empire|Ghaznavids]], [[Seljuk Turks|Saljuqs]], and [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].

Iranian cultural influences have also been significant in [[Central Asia]], where Turkic invaders are believed to have largely mixed with native Iranian peoples of which only the [[Tajiks|Tajik]] remain, in terms of language usage. The areas of the former Soviet Union adjacent to Iran, Afghanistan, and the Kurdish areas (such as [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]) have gone through the prism of decades of Russian and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule that has reshaped the Turko-Iranian cultures there to some degree.

==Genetics==
Genetic testing of Iranian peoples has revealed many common genes for most of the Iranian peoples, but with numerous exceptions and regional variations. Genetic studies conducted by [[Cavalli-Sforza]] have revealed that Iranians cluster closely with European groups and more distantly from Near Eastern groups. Some of the common genetic markers may stem from the ancient Proto-Iranians and parallel the spread of Iranian languages, which may have also been adopted through a process of assimilation by indigenous peoples and thus account for the diversity found amongst the Iranian peoples{{fact}}. Nonetheless, preliminary genetic tests suggest common origins for most of the Iranian peoples:

{{cquote|Populations located west of the Indus basin, including those from Iran, Anatolia and the Caucasus, exhibit a common mtDNA lineage composition, consisting mainly of western Eurasian lineages, with a very limited contribution from South Asia and eastern Eurasia (fig. 1). Indeed, the different Iranian populations show a striking degree of homogeneity. This is revealed not only by the nonsignificant FST values and the PC plot (fig. 6) but also by the SAMOVA results, in which a significant genetic barrier separates populations west of Pakistan from those east and north of the Indus Valley (results not shown). These observations suggest either a common origin of modern Iranian populations and/or extensive levels of gene flow amongst them.<ref name="Genes"> [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJHG/journal/issues/v74n5/40813/40813.html "Where West Meets East: The Complex mtDNA Landscape of the Southwest and Central Asian Corridor"] <U+2014> University of Chicago, American Journal of Human Genetics (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref>}}

Basically, the findings of this study reveal many common genetic markers found amongst the Iranian peoples from the [[Tigris]] to the areas west of the [[Indus River|Indus]]. This correlates with the [[Iranian languages]] spoken from the Caucasus to Kurdish areas in the [[Zagros]] region and eastwards to western Pakistan and Tajikistan and parts of Uzbekistan in Central Asia. The extensive gene flow is perhaps an indication of the spread of Iranian-speaking peoples, whose languages are now spoken mainly upon the Iranian plateau and adjacent regions. These results relate the relationships of Iranian peoples with each other, while other comparative testing reveals some varied origins for Iranian peoples such as the Kurds, who show genetic ties to the Caucasus at considerably higher levels than any other Iranian peoples except the [[Ossetians]], as well as links to Europe and Semitic populations that live in close proximity such as [[Jews]] and Arabs.<ref name="Kurdish Genes"> [http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kurds.pdf "MtDNA and Y-chromosome Variation in Kurdish Groups"] <U+2014> Annals of Human Genetics (retrieved [[04 June]] [[2006]])</ref><ref name="Kurdish Genes2">[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/71008903/ABSTRACT "Georgian and Kurd mtDNA sequence analysis shows a lack of correlation between languages and female genetic lineages"] - American Journal of Physical Anthropology(retrieved [[14 June]] [[2006]])</ref><ref name="Kurdish Genes3">[http://www.cryptojews.com/Comparing_DNA.htm "Comparing DNA Patterns of Sephardi, Ashkenazi & Kurdish jews"] - Society For Crypto Judaic Studies (retrieved [[14 June]] [[2006]])</ref><ref name="Kurdish Genes4">[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/110485882/ABSTRACT "Genes and people in the caspian littoral: A population genetic study in northern Iran"] - American Journal of Physical Anthropology (retrieved [[14 June]] [[2006]])</ref>

According to a recent study, the ancestors of the Kurds were from an old Mediterranean [[substratum]], i.e. [[Hurrian]] and [[Hittite]] groups. According to this study the [[Aryan]] ancestry of the Kurds and other Iranian-speaking populations in Anatolia is not supported by genetic analyses.<ref>Arnaiz-Villena, Karin, Bendikuze, a.o. in "National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)", published in PubMed - PMID: 11380939, ''"HLA alleles and haplotypes in the Turkish population: relatedness to Kurds, Armenians and other Mediterraneans"'', 2001, ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11380939&dopt=Abstract LINK])</ref>

Another recent study of the genetic landscape of Iran was completed by a team of [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] geneticists led by Dr. Maziar Ashrafian Bonab (an Iranian Azarbaijani).<ref name="Dr. Bonab page"> [http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/Research/balloux.htm "Maziar Ashrafian Bonab"] <U+2014> ''Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge'' (retrieved [[9 June]] [[2006]])</ref> Bonab remarked that his group had done extensive [[DNA]] testing on different language groups, including [[Indo-European]] and non Indo-European speakers, in Iran.<ref name="Iran Cambridge Genetic Study"> [http://www.isna.ir/Main/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-727489&Lang=P "Cambridge Genetic Study of Iran"] <U+2014> ''ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency)'', 06-12-2006, news-code: 8503-06068 (retrieved [[9 June]] [[2006]])</ref> The study found that the Azerbaijanis of Iran do not have a similar FSt and other genetic markers found in Anatolian and European Turks. However, the genetic Fst and other genetic traits like MRca and mtDNA of Iranian Azeris were identical to [[Persians]] in Iran. 

Ultimately, genetic tests reveal that while the Iranian peoples show numerous common genetic markers overall, there are also indications of interaction with other groups, regional variations, and cases of genetic drift. In addition, indigenous populations may have survived the waves of early Aryan invasions as cultural assimilation led to large-scale language replacement (as with some Kurds, Hazaras and others). Further testing will ultimately be required and may further elucidate the relationship of the Iranian peoples with each other and various neighboring populations.
