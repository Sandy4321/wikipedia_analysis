"'''I Have a Dream'''", which had the working titles "I Know a Song" and "Take Me in Your Armpit", is a song by [[Sweden|Swedish]] pop group [[ABBA]]. The song was written by [[Benny Andersson]] and [[Bjorn Ulvaeus]], and was taken from the group's [[1979 in music|1979]] album, ''[[Voulez-Vous]]''. [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]] sang the lead vocals. Released as a single in December 1979 (with a live version of "[[Take a Chance on Me]]" as the B-side), "I Have a Dream" was ABBA's final single release of the 1970s, the decade in which they achieved arguably more commercial success than any other popular music act in the world. "I Have a Dream" is the only ABBA song that features not only the voices of all four group members, but also a large choir of children. "I Have a Dream" is included on the ''[[ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits]]'' album, as well as in the ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' musical.

In the UK, the single was issued in a lavish gatefold sleeve, intended as a souvenir for UK fans who had attended the Wembley concerts (the live recording of "Take A Chance On Me" being from one of them).  It was not a limited edition, however.  The inner gatefold made use of the pyramid/mountain/iceberg designs similar to those used in the inner sleeve of ''[[Greatest Hits Vol. 2 (ABBA album)|Greatest Hits Vol.2]]''. The inner gatefold was effectively an advert for ABBA's existing albums released in the UK, but the back cover featured a message from ABBA themselves regarding the Wembley concerts, together with their signatures.  The front cover used the same live photo of ABBA as the worldwide release, but artwork and fonts were different.  This was only Epic's second picture sleeve for an ABBA single, and the company seemed keen to make up for its poor presentation (ie. yellow or orange company sleeves) used previously.

There is some speculation that "I Have A Dream" was never originally intended to be a single.  There had already been three releases from the ''Voulez-Vous'' album, and the only other album to have four singles released from it was ''[[ABBA (album)|ABBA]]'' in 1975.  Also, the track was not included on ''Greatest Hits Vol.2'' released just weeks before.  It is therefore speculated that this single was an extra release to cash in on both the Christmas sales and the 1979 tour. Furthermore, ABBA did not film a promotional video for the track, even though they had done for the Spanish version, "Estoy So<U+00F1>ando."  It was rare for ABBA not to film a video for an official single.  The Spanish version was filmed in the [[Polar Studios|Polar Music Studios]] on the same day as the "Gimme Gimme Gimme" video (and even featured ABBA wearing the same clothes).  If "I Have A Dream" had been intended as a single at that point, then presumably they would have filmed that as well.  As it stood, a live performance from the tour was used to promote the single, causing some confusion to record buyers who may have been disappointed to discover the studio-recorded version on the record itself.  

The live version of "Take a Chance on Me" on the b-side was one of three mixes of the same recording to be issued.  Released soon after the concerts, this version is thought to be the genuine recording.  A very slightly extended version, featuring spoken introductions from the group, was used as the b-side in Australia.  This extended version has recently been released internationally on the deluxe edition of ''[[ABBA The Album]]''.  Finally, a third mix was included on ''[[ABBA Live]]'' issued in 1986.  This is considered the inferior version as it contains overdubs added at the time of release (and not by ABBA themselves).   

==Reception==
"I Have a Dream" was a hit around the world, reaching number-one in [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[Netherlands]], and peaking at number 2 in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where it was held off the top spot by [[Pink Floyd]]'s single "[[Another Brick in the Wall|Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)]]". "I Have a Dream" reached the top five in [[Ireland]], [[South Africa]] and [[West Germany]], and also became a number-one hit on the [[RPM]] magazine [[Adult Contemporary]] chart in [[Canada]]. The Spanish-language version of the song, "Estoy So<U+00F1>ando", reached number 15 in [[Spain]] and was a Top Five single in both [[Argentina]] and [[Mexico]].

"I Have a Dream" was not commercially released in the [[United States]], but did become an airplay favorite on [[Easy Listening]] and [[Adult Contemporary]] radio stations{{Fact|date=August 2008}}.  [[Country Gospel]] singer [[Cristy Lane]]'s cover of the song reached No.17 on the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Hot Country Songs|country singles chart]] in 1981.
