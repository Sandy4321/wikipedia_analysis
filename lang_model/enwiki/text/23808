The '''Hellenic Naval Air Service''' ({{lang-el|<U+039D><U+03B1><U+03C5><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AE> <U+0391><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AE> <U+03A5><U+03C0><U+03B7><U+03C1><U+03B5><U+03C3><U+03AF><U+03B1>}}) or '''<U+039D><U+0391><U+03A5>''' was the air arm of the [[Hellenic Navy]] from 1915 to 1930.

The first aviation units in the [[Military of Greece|Greek Armed Forces]] were formed in June 1912. In the following [[Balkan Wars]], the Hellenic Navy was the first in military history to use aircraft to track down and bomb the enemy fleet (1913).<ref name=Fotakis75/> The Naval Air Service was officially established during the [[First World War]] and participated with the [[Triple Entente|Allies]] in several missions over the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. After participation in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]] a long period of peace followed during which the Naval Air Service was reorganized and upgraded, especially with the establishment of the [[State Aircraft Factory (Greece)|State Aircraft Factory]], which manufactured various types of aircraft. In 1930 the Naval Air Service was merged with the Hellenic Army Aviation and formed the third branch in the Greek Armed Forces, the [[Hellenic Air Force]].

The Hellenic Naval Air Service must not be confused with the current aviation branch of the Hellenic Navy, which includes the helicopter-equipped [[Navy Helicopter Command]] (<U+0394><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03AF><U+03BA><U+03B7><U+03C3><U+03B7> <U+0395><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C0><U+03C4><U+03AD><U+03C1><U+03C9><U+03BD> <U+039D><U+03B1><U+03C5><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03CD>&nbsp;<U+2013> <U+0394><U+0395><U+039D>) and the [[353rd Naval Cooperation Squadron]] (353 <U+039C><U+039D><U+0391><U+03A3>), run jointly with the Hellenic Air Force.

==History==

===Preparations and Balkan Wars (1912<U+2013>1913)===
Aviation had been introduced to [[Greece]] in February 1912, when [[Emmanouil Argyropoulos]] performed a flight, with his privately owned [[Nieuport IV]].G aircraft, around [[Athens]]. An hour later a second flight was carried on with the Prime Minister of Greece, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] as passenger. Venizelos, impressed by the potential of air warfare, suggested that Greece should take advance of this new weapon.<ref name=Fotakis75>Fotakis (2005) p. 75</ref> The following months a French military mission took up the development of Greek aviation by creating a fleet of four [[Farman MF.7|Maurice Farman MF.7]] airplanes.<ref name=Fotakis75/> In June 1912, aviator [[Dimitrios Kamperos]] modified one of the Farmans into a hydroplane, giving it the name of the mythical hero ''[[Daedalus]]''.<ref name=Boyne2002>Boyne (2002) p. 268</ref>
[[File:Ensign Aristeidis Moraitidis.jpg|thumb|150px|Aristeidis Moraitinis, commander of the Hellenic Naval Air Service (1917<U+2013>1918).]]
When the [[Balkan Wars]] broke out in October 1912, these airplanes performed a number of reconnaissance and bombing missions; the most notable was a sortie against the Ottoman fleet anchorage in the [[Dardanelles]],<ref name=Fotakis75/> where First Lieutenant [[Michael Moutoussis]] and Ensign [[Aristeidis Moraitinis (aviator)|Aristeidis Moraitinis]] spotted the Ottoman fleet and dropped four bombs. This mission is regarded as the first naval-air operation in military history and was widely commented upon in the press, both Greek and international.<ref>Boyne (2002) p. 66</ref><ref>{{cite web

===World War I===
At the beginning of 1914 credits were voted for the creation of a naval aerodrome in [[Eleusina]], [[Attica]]. Meanwhile, despite limited funds Aristeidis Moraitinis managed to establish the first naval aviation school and corps.<ref name=Boyne2002/> In spring 1915 the establishment of an independent Naval Aviation Department within the Ministry of Naval Affairs and the incorporation of the Greek naval air fleet into the Greek Navy ensured the foundation of the Naval Air Service (NAY).<ref>Fotakis (2005) p. 76</ref>
Meanwhile, disagreements between King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] and Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] over whether Greece should enter [[World War I]], lead to political instability and the [[National Schism]] (1914<U+2013>1916). Greece officially joined the [[Triple Entente]] at June 1917, however the anti-royalist party of the country under the leadership of Venizelos formed a [[Movement of National Defence]] that supported the Allied military operations in the region from December 1916.<ref name=Karytinos>{{cite journal |last= Karytinos |first= Alexios|author= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |date= July 2010 |title= H <U+0395><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AE> <U+0391><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03B1> <U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03C2> <U+0391><U+03C1><U+03C7><U+03AD><U+03C2> <U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C5> 20<U+03BF><U+03C5> <U+03B1><U+03B9><U+03CE><U+03BD><U+03B1>: <U+0392><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03AF> <U+03A0><U+03CC><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03B9><U+2013><U+0391><U+2019> <U+03A0><U+03B1><U+03B3><U+03BA><U+03CC><U+03C3><U+03BC><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2> [Hellenic Aviation at Early 20th Century: Balkan War-World War I|journal= <U+0391><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AE> <U+0395><U+03C0><U+03B9><U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03CE><U+03C1><U+03B7><U+03C3><U+03B7> |volume= |series= |issue= 89|pages= 48<U+2013>59 |at= |publisher= |location= |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url= http://www.haf.gr/el/articles/pdf/ae_89.pdf |language= Greek |format=PDF |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |laysummary= |laysource= |laydate= |quote= |ref=  }}</ref>

In the following [[Greco-Turkish War of 1919<U+2013>1922]] the Naval Aviation formed one squadron, that together with additional four of the Army Aviation Service participated in operations in [[Asia Minor]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.haf.gr/en/history/history/history_4.asp |title= Hellenic Air Force History: Campaign in Asia minor |author= |date= |work= |publisher= Hellenic Air Force General Staff |accessdate=2010-07-10}}</ref> This squadron ({{lang-el|<U+039D><U+03B1><U+03C5><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AE> <U+0391><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AE> <U+039C><U+03BF><U+03AF><U+03C1><U+03B1> <U+03A3><U+03BC><U+03CD><U+03C1><U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03C2>}}) initially consisted of 10 [[Airco DH.9]] bombers and 15 [[Sopwith Camel F.1]] fighters.<ref name="Kaisarou-Pantazopoulou, Beldekos 2000 p. 50">Kaisarou-Pantazopoulou, Beldekos, Karytinos (2000) p. 50</ref>

The Asia Minor Campaign was followed by a long period of peace during which both the Hellenic Army and Naval Aviation Services were reorganized and upgraded. From 1925 new types of aircraft of British and, mainly, French manufacture were delivered. At 1925, in co-operation with the British Company [[Blackburn Aircraft]], the [[State Aircraft Factory (Greece)|State Aircraft Factory]] (KEA) was set up in [[Phaleron]], near Athens. The factory developed a number of aircraft that were designed by Blackburn Aircraft and built under license, like the two-seat torpedo carrier, [[Blackburn Velos|T3A Velos]] and the [[KEA Chelidon]],<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.haf.gr/el/mission/weapons/historic/1929_1934/Blackburn_Velos_T3.asp |title= Blackburn "Velos" T.3/T.3A |author= |date= |work= |publisher= Hellenic Air Force General Staff |accessdate=2010-09-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last= |first= | title=Jane's all the world's aircraft, 1927 | publisher=Franklin Watts | year=1927 | editor= Jane Frederick Thomas| page= |url= http://books.google.com/books?ei=HMQfTJ2zDo6C_AaVtpm9DQ&ct=result&hl=el&id=K4k7AAAAMAAJ&dq=Chelidon%2BJane%27s&q=Chelidon%2BVelos#search_anchor| isbn=}}</ref> as well as the [[Armstrong Whitworth Atlas]] and the [[Avro 504]].<ref name=hafinterwar>{{cite web|url= http://www.haf.gr/en/history/history/history_5.asp |title= Hellenic Air Force History: Inter-War Period |author= |date= |work= |publisher= Hellenic Air Force General Staff |accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref> On the other hand, a new Naval Aviation school was established at [[Tatoi]], [[Attica]], in 1926.<ref name="Kaisarou-Pantazopoulou, Beldekos 2000 p. 50"/>

In 1930 the Air Ministry was founded and the [[Hellenic Air Force]] was established as a unified independent branch of the Hellenic Armed Forces.
