Smith is the son of Frederick C. Smith, the founder of the [[Greyhound Lines|Dixie Greyhound Bus Lines]] and [[Toddle House]] restaurant chain.<ref>http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20050605/ai_n14669376</ref><ref>[http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/biography/S-Z/Smith-Fred-1944.html Fred Smith 1944<U+2014> - Early life, The road to fedex, A radical idea, Going global<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Frederick C. Smith died when Smith was only 4, and the boy was raised by his mother and uncles.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/smi0bio-1 Frederick W. Smith Biography: Father of the Overnight Delivery Business]</ref>

Smith had a great interest in flying, and became an amateur pilot as a teen. He attended high school at [[Memphis University School]].  

In 1962,  Smith [[matriculation|entered]] [[Yale University]].  While attending Yale, he wrote a paper for an economics class, outlining overnight delivery service in a computer [[information age]].  Folklore suggests he received a C for this paper although in a later interview he claims that when asked he told a reporter "I don't know what grade, probably made my usual C". The paper became the idea of FedEx (for years, the sample package displayed in the company's print advertisements featured a return address at Yale).  Smith became a member of [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity and [[Skull and Bones]].<ref>[[Alexandra Robbins]], ''Secrets of the Tomb: Skull and Bones, the Ivy League, and the Hidden Paths of Power'', [[Little, Brown and Company]], 2002, page 172, 180-1</ref><ref>"Frederick W. Smith." ''Contemporary Newsmakers'' 1985, Issue Cumulation. Gale Research, 1986.</ref> He received his [[Bachelor's degree]] in economics in 1966. In his college years, he was a friend of [[George W. Bush]].<ref>[http://www.allbusiness.com/human-resources/workforce-management-hiring-consulting/1131089-1.html "Live" with TAE: Frederick Smith]</ref>  Smith was also friends with [[John Kerry]] and shared an enthusiasm for aviation with Kerry<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE7DF173BF935A35754C0A9629C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR; Idealistic Man on Campus To Realistic Sailor at War]</ref> and was a flying partner with him. He is well known for his baking skills, and likes blueberry pie.

==Marine Corps service==
After graduation, Smith joined in the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]], serving for four years, from 1966 to 1969, as a platoon leader and a [[Forward_air_control|forward air controller]] (FAC), flying in the back seat of the [[OV-10]]. Much mythology exists about this part of his life; Smith was a Marine Corps "Ground Officer" for his entire service. He was specially trained to fly with pilots and observe and 'control' ground action. He never went through Navy flight training and was not a "Naval aviator" or "pilot" in the military. Individuals who completed Navy flight training and became a "Designated Naval Aviator" (pilot) were obligated to serve six years at the time.

As a Marine, Smith had the opportunity to observe the [[Military logistics|military's logistics system]] first hand. He served two tours of duty in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], flying with pilots on over 200 combat missions. He was [[Honorable discharge#Honorable|honorably discharged]] in 1969 with the rank of Captain, having received the [[Silver Star]], the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]], and two [[Purple Heart]]s. While in the military, Smith carefully observed the procurement and delivery procedures, fine-tuning his dream for an overnight delivery service.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Smith also served with, and became a personal friend of, legendary Special Forces-Intelligence hero Marine Lt. Col. [[Bill Cowan|William V. "Bill" Cowan]] during his Vietnam service. Cowan's wvc3 group is famous for daring hostage rescues, and assisted Smith in FedEx's expansion into the [[Middle East]].

==Business career==
In 1970, Smith purchased the controlling interest in an aircraft maintenance company, Ark Aviation Sales,<ref name="fedex">[http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/smi0int-1#smi0-003 Father of the overnight delevery business]</ref> and by 1971 turned its focus to trading used jets. On June 18, 1971, Smith founded Federal Express with his $4 million inheritance (about $21 million in 2008 dollars)<ref> [http://minneapolisfed.org/index.cfm]</ref>, and raised $91 million (about $484 million in 2008 dollars)<ref> [http://minneapolisfed.org/index.cfm]</ref> in venture capital. In 1973, the company began offering service to 25 cities, and it began with small packages and documents and a fleet of 14 [[Falcon_20|Falcon 20]] (DA-20) jets. His focus was on developing an integrated air-ground system, which had never been done before.  Smith developed FedEx on the business idea of a shipment version of a bank [[Clearing house (finance)|clearing house]] where one bank clearing house was located in the middle of the representative banks and all their representatives would be sent to the central location to exchange materials.<ref name="fedex"/>

Smith has served on the boards of several large public companies, the [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, Tennessee)|St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]] and [[Mayo Clinic|Mayo Foundation]] boards. He was formerly chairman of the Board of Governors for the [[International Air Transport Association]] and the '''U.S. Air Transport Association'''. Smith is chair of the Business Roundtable's Security Task Force, and a member of the Business Council and the [[Cato Institute]]. He served as chairman of the U.S.-China Business Council and is the current chairman of the French-American Business Council. In addition, Smith was named 2006 Person of the Year by the French-American Chamber of Commerce. He is a member of the Aviation Hall of Fame.  Smith was approached by Senator [[Bob Dole]], who asked Smith for support in opening corporate doors for a new [[World War II]] memorial.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,121462,00.html Former Senator Bob Dole Discusses the New WW II Memorial]</ref>  Smith was appointed to co-chairman of the U.S. World War II Memorial Project.  Smith was named as Chief Executive magazine's 2004 "CEO of the Year".

In addition to FedEx, Smith is also a co-owner of the [[Washington Redskins]] [[National Football League|NFL]] Team. This partnership resulted in FedEx sponsorship of the [[Joe Gibbs]] [[NASCAR]] racing team. Smith also owns or co-owns several entertainment companies, including '''Dream Image Productions''' and '''Alcon Films''' (producers of the [[Warner Bros.]] hit film [[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]] starring [[Al Pacino]] and [[Robin Williams]]).

A DKE Fraternity Brother of [[George W. Bush]] while at Yale, after Bush's 2000 election, there was some speculation that Smith might be appointed to the Bush Cabinet as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Defense Secretary]].<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2007-01-27

Despite some speculation and even pushing from former [[United States Senate|Senator]] and [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] [[Howard Baker]], he was not appointed &mdash; [[Donald Rumsfeld]] was named instead. Although Smith was friends with both 2004 major candidates, [[John Kerry]] and [[George W. Bush]], Smith chose to endorse Bush's re-election in 2004.

Smith was a supporter of Senator [[John McCain]]'s 2008 Presidential bid, and had been named McCain's National Co-Chairman of his campaign committee. Some had speculated that Smith might have a role as an economic advisor in a theoretical McCain administration.

Mr. Smith was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1998.

Smith was presented the 2008 Kellogg Award for Distinguished Leadership by the [[Kellogg School of Management]] on May 29th, 2008.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2008-05-30|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news/whatsnew/fredsmith.htm |title=Kellogg honors FedEx CEO Fred Smith as Distinguished Leader}}</ref>  He was also awarded the 2008 Bower Award for Business Leadership from The [[Franklin Institute]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.<ref>[http://www.fi.edu/franklinawards/08/laureate_bowerb-smith.html]</ref>

==Quotes from Fred Smith==

"We'd run out of money and we didn't have all the regulatory requirements that we needed. My half-sisters were up in arms because it looked like we were going to lose some money. Everything was going wrong, except the fundamentals of the business were proving every single day that the idea was right."

"This is a guarantee. If we don't get it there, we don't get paid."

"Credibility... What do we sell? We sell trust. We thought we were selling the transportation of goods. In fact, we were selling peace of mind.
    
" I think the American Dream is freedom.[8]
