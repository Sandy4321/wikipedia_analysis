'''Highbury & Islington station''' is a [[National Rail]] and [[London Underground]] station, in the [[London Borough of Islington]] in North London. It serves the suburbs of [[Highbury]] and [[Islington]]. The name is often shortened to simply '''Highbury'''.

The station is on the Underground's [[Victoria Line]], between [[Finsbury Park tube station|Finsbury Park]] and [[Kings Cross St. Pancras tube station|King's Cross St. Pancras]]. It is also on the National Rail [[North London Line|North London]] and [[Northern City Line|Northern City]] lines. It is in [[Travelcard Zone 2]].

==History==

The current station is an amalgamation of two older stations. The first stood on the site of the existing station. It was built in [[1872]] by the [[North London Railway]] (NLR) as an impressive [[victorian era|Victorian]]-[[Gothic Revival architecture|gothic]] building with a drive-in forecourt.

The second station was on the opposite side of [[Holloway Road]]. It was opened on [[28 June]] [[1904]] by the [[Great Northern & City Railway]] (GN&CR) on its line between [[Finsbury Park station|Finsbury Park]] and Moorgate. This line and the station was operated by the [[Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Railways#Metropolitan Railway|Metropolitan Railway]] and its successors from 1913 until 1975, when it was transferred to [[British Rail]], by which time it was known as the Northern City Line.

The NLR station was seriously damaged by a [[V-1 flying bomb]] that fell on Highbury Corner on [[27 June]] [[1944]] and most of the station buildings were demolished. The original platform buildings on the westbound platform remain and there are some small remnants of the original entrance building to the left of the current station entrance.

The current single-storey structure was built in the [[1960s]] for the opening of the Victoria Line on [[1 September]] [[1968]] and provides a combined entrance for all of the lines serving the station. When the [[escalator]]s to the deep level platforms were opened the GN&CR station building was closed. This unused entrance still exists, and has been recently refurbished externally.

The route of the Victoria Line was planned to provide the maximum number of interchanges with other Underground and British Rail lines and, where possible, these interchanges were designed to be simple cross platform connections between different services heading in the same direction. To facilitate this at Highbury & Islington, the northbound NCL platform was reallocated for use by the southbound Victoria Line giving the new line a direct link to the southbound NCL platform. Two new platforms were constructed for the northbound platforms of the Victoria and NCL. The northbound NCL tunnel was diverted to link to the new platform and the southbound Victoria tunnel connected to the old northbound NCL tunnel a short distance each side of the station.

==Future==
In [[2007]], the services run by [[Silverlink]] on the North London Line will be transferred to the control of [[Transport for London]] and renamed as [[London Overground]]. Added to the NLL services, in [[2010]] Highbury & Islington will become the new northern terminus of phase one of the [[East London Line|East London Railway]] extension, which will also be operated as part of London Overground. It has been suggested that recent renovations to the still-closed GN&CR station entrance [[as of 2006]] are part of this work. 

[[London Borough of Islington|Islington Council]] is currently considering redeveloping the site of the current station, and Highbury Corner generally, including possibly covering over the North London Line tracks and building an office block above the site.
