==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}
[[Image:Burns and Lisa.JPG|left|200px|thumb|Lisa helps Mr. Burns with recycling.]]
[[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]] speaks with the [[Springfield Elementary School]] "Junior Achievers Club" and after a conversation with [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], he realizes that he does not have as much money as he thought he did. He discovers that he had lost a lot of money and decides to try to earn it back. However, in doing so, he makes more questionable investments and becomes bankrupt. The bank forecloses on the plant and sells Mr. Burns's house to [[Bret Hart]].

Mr. Burns moves in with [[Waylon Smithers|Smithers]] and, wanting to be of use, Burns decides to help Smithers out by going grocery shopping. However, he is unfamiliar with grocery stores and becomes confused by the [[ketchup]] and catsup, causing the grocer to send Burns to the [[Springfield Retirement Castle]]. While at the home, Mr. Burns meets Lisa again, and, seeing that she is determined and smart, he begs her to help re-build his empire. She eventually agrees on the condition that he drop his evil ways, and the two begin earning money through [[recycling]]. 

Mr. Burns enthusiastically begins grabbing every can he can find, causing Lisa to believe that he has changed. Eventually, Burns earns so much money that he is able to open his own recycling plant. Burns gives Lisa a tour, showing her that its environmentally sound and made of recycled materials. At first, Lisa is impressed, but then Burns shows her "the best part". He has attached millions of six-pack holders together into a net which he used to catch tons of sea life and make "Lisa slurry".<!--what does this mean? needs explanation --> Lisa is horrified; she proclaims that Burns is still evil, and runs through the streets trying to get people to stop recycling. 

Mr. Burns later visits Lisa and tells her that he sold the recycling plant for [[United states dollar|US$]]120 million and he has decided to give her a 10% share of the profits. Lisa decides that she can't accept the check, causing Homer to have four simultaneous heart attacks.<ref name=officialsite/><ref name="Simpsguide">{{cite book|last=Martyn |first=Warren|coauthors=Adrian Wood|title=I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide |year=2000 |publisher=Virgin Books|id=ISBN 0-7535-0495-2|pages=}}</ref><ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|id=ISBN 0-00063-8898-1|pages=p. 236}}</ref>

==Production==
The episode was based on a story idea pitched by [[David X. Cohen]]<ref name="Cohen">{{cite video | people=Cohen, David X.|year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "The Old Man and the Lisa"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> although it was written by [[John Swartzwelder]], who has written many of the ''Simpsons'' episodes that have environmental themes.<ref name="Weinstein">{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh|year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "The Old Man and the Lisa"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> This lead him to being called the "conscience of the staff"<ref name="Meyer">{{cite video | people=Meyer, George|year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "The Old Man and the Lisa"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> despite being a "self declared anti-environmentalist."<ref name="Groening">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "The Old Man and the Lisa"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> It was because of this that he was given such episodes, because the staff felt that he would give them just the right amount of sarcasm.<ref name="Cohen"/> In the original script for the episode, he described the recycling center as "a couple of hippies surrounded by garbage".<ref name="Meyer"/> Two alternate original titles for the episode were Cohen's "Lisa and Burns" and Swartzwelder's "Burns Goes Broke".<ref name="Cohen"/>

The writers had wanted an episode where Burns becomes bankrupt and shows what Burns would be like as a person in the real world.<ref name="Weinstein"/> The idea with the recycling plant was that Burns didn't have any sort of evil plan, he just couldn't help being himself.<ref name="Weinstein"/> Burns really was trying to change and this was reflected in the end when he tried to give Lisa her share of the profits.<ref name="Kirkland"/> Burns was drawn without his trademark scowl for this episode.<ref name="Kirkland"/> 

===Casting===
[[Image:BretHartTheSimpsons.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Bret Hart]]'s cameo]]
[[professional wrestling|Professional wrestler]] [[Bret Hart]] guest starred in the episode as himself, and he was very insistent that he be shown wearing his pink wrestling outfit.<ref name="Kirkland">{{cite video | people=Kirkland, Mark|year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "The Old Man and the Lisa"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>  He explained that "It's so cool to be part of a show that makes people laugh really, really hard."<ref>Cam Hutchinson, "Doran Johnson given brushoff again," ''Star-Phoenix'', Saskatoon, Saskatchewan: April 19, 1997, pg. B.4.</ref>  The media, aware that the animated Hart would want to purchase Mr. Burns' home, mistakenly anticipated that "Bret offers to wrestle him [Mr. Burns] for the place."<ref>James Muretich, "Worth Watching," ''[[Calgary Herald]]'', August 31, 1998, pg. B.8.</ref>  Later, Hart moved on to do voice work on the animated television series ''[[Jacob Two-Two (TV series)|Jacob Two-Two]]''.  The press noted that at that time Hart was "no stranger to cartoon-land," having been "immortalized" by "The Old Man and the Lisa."<ref>Heath McCoy, "Former wrestler Bret Hart to play the Hooded Fang," ''[[National Post]]'', August 28, 2003, pg. AL.5.</ref> A clip of this episode was later included in the Bret Hart documentary "[[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows|Wrestling with Shadows]]."

==Cultural references==
Burns's walk through the supermarket was based on a time that [[George H. W. Bush]] visited a store and was confused by the scanner and in the original draft for the episode, Burns met Bush while there.<ref name="Weinstein"/> The voice of the hippie is based on [[Dennis Hopper]]'s character in "[[Apocalypse Now]]."<ref name="Castellaneta">{{cite video | people=Castellaneta, Dan|year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "The Old Man and the Lisa"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The song "[[Achy Breaky Heart]]" by [[Billy Ray Cyrus]] is played at the old folks' home.<ref name=bbc/> The scene where Mr. Burns chases Lisa through town is a spoof of the opening to the TV series ''[[That Girl]]''.<ref name="Weinstein"/> The end of the episode where Lisa is trying to get the town to stop recycling is a parody of the ending of ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]''.

==Reception==
Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', called it "An odd episode with a not-too-unexpected outcome. The best bits are undoubtedly Burns learning his way around a supermarket and Lisa's realisation of what Burns has been up to."<ref name="bbc"/> The episode currently holds a score of 7.2/10 at the [[Internet Movie Database]]<ref name="IMDB">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0701253/|title=The Old Man and the Lisa|accessdate=2007-04-13|publisher=IMDB.com}}</ref> and a score of 8.4/10 at [[TV.com]].<ref name="TV">{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/the-simpsons/the-old-man-and-the-lisa/episode/1459/summary.html|title=The Old Man and the Lisa|accessdate=2007-04-13|publisher=TV.com}}</ref>
