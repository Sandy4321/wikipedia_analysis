The '''Cerameicus Painter''' (also '''Kerameikos Painter''') was one of the first [[Attica|Attic]] [[black-figure vase painting|black-figure vase painters]]. He was active around 600 BC.

The Cerameicus Painter can be placed stylistically between the [[Nessos Painter]] and the [[Gorgon Painter]],; he is probably chronologically closer to the latter. He was less productive than the Gorgon Painter and painted in a simple yet fluid style. His name is based on his [[name vase]], found in the [[Kerameikos]] of [[Athens]]. That vase is an '<U+2019>[[olpe]]<U+2019><U+2019> and can be considered exemplary of the vase painting of its time. The vase is subdivided into several zones of animal friezes. In the upper area, a single mythological figure is flanked by two lions, the latter a popular motif at the time.
