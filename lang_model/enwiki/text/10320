'''Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0412><U+044F><U+0447><U+0435><U+0441><U+043B><U+0430><U+0301><U+0432> <U+041C><U+0438><U+0445><U+0430><U+0301><U+0439><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+041C><U+043E><U+0301><U+043B><U+043E><U+0442><U+043E><U+0432>}}; {{OldStyleDate|9 March,|1890|25 February}} <U+2013> 8 November 1986) was a [[Soviet people|Soviet]] [[politician]] and [[diplomacy|diplomat]], an [[Old Bolshevik]] and a leading figure in the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]] from the 1920s, when he rose to power as a [[prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>]] of [[Joseph Stalin]], to 1957, when he was dismissed from the Presidium (Politburo) of the Central Committee by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. He served as [[List of Premiers of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of People's Commissars|Council of People's Commissars]] from 1930 to 1941, and as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] from 1939 to 1949 and 1953 to 1957. Molotov served for several years as [[List of First Deputies of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Premier]] of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s cabinet. Molotov retired in 1961 after several years of obscurity.

Molotov was the principal Soviet signatory of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-Soviet [[non-aggression pact]] of 1939 (also known as the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]]) as well as post-war negotiations, and a signatory of the Politburo resolution authorizing the [[Katyn massacre]]. Following the aftermath of the [[World War II|Great Patriotic War]] (World War II) Molotov kept his place, until 1949, as a leading Soviet diplomat and politician. In 1949, after losing Stalin's favour, lost his foreign affairs ministership. Molotov's relationship with Stalin deteriorated further, with Stalin complaining about Molotov's so-called mistakes in his speech to the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Party Congress]]. However, after Stalin's death in 1953 Molotov was staunchly opposed to Khrushchev's [[de-Stalinization]] policy. He remained unapologetic about the crimes of Stalin's regime, and had few regrets of his actions and that of [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|the Party]], a view that remained with him until he died in 1986. 

==Early life and career (1890<U+2013>1930)==
Molotov was born '''Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Skryabin''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0412><U+044F><U+0447><U+0435><U+0441><U+043B><U+0430><U+0432> <U+041C><U+0438><U+0445><U+0430><U+0439><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+0421><U+043A><U+0440><U+044F><U+0301><U+0431><U+0438><U+043D>}}) in the village of [[Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast|Kukarka]] (now Sovetsk in [[Kirov Oblast]]), the son of a shop clerk. Contrary to a commonly repeated error, he was not related to the composer [[Alexander Scriabin]].{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=40}} He was educated at a secondary school in [[Kazan]], and joined the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP) in 1906. For his political work he took the [[pseudonym]] '''Molotov''' (from the Russian ''molot'', ''"[[hammer]]"'').{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=30}} He was arrested in 1909 and spent two years in exile in [[Vologda]]. In 1911 he enrolled at the [[St Petersburg]] Polytechnic, and also joined the editorial staff of ''[[Pravda]]'', the underground Bolshevik newspaper, of which [[Joseph Stalin]] was editor. In 1915 Molotov was again arrested and deported to [[Irkutsk]], but in 1916 he escaped and returned to the capital.<ref>{{Cite book | author = F. Burg, David  | title = The Great Depression | publisher = [[Infobase Publishing]] | year = 2005 | isbn = 0816057095 | page = 378 }}</ref>

In 1916, Molotov became a member of Bolshevik Party's committee in [[Petrograd]]. When the [[February Revolution]] occurred in 1917, he was one of the few Bolsheviks of any standing in the capital. Under his direction ''[[Pravda]]'' took to the "left" to oppose the Provisional Government which was formed after the revolution. Consequently, when [[Joseph Stalin]] returned to the capital, he reversed Molotov's line.<ref name=warheroes>{{cite web | author = | trans_title = Mikhailovich Molotov, Vyacheslav | title = <U+041C><U+043E><U+043B><U+043E><U+0442><U+043E><U+0432>, <U+0412><U+044F><U+0447><U+0435><U+0441><U+043B><U+0430><U+0432> <U+041C><U+0438><U+0445><U+0430><U+0439><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> | language = Russian | publisher = warheroes.ru | url = http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=12478 | accessdate = 17 January 2010 | date = }}</ref> However, when the party leader, [[Vladimir Lenin]], arrived, he overruled Stalin. Despite this, Molotov became a prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> and close adherent of Stalin, an alliance to which he owed not only his later prominence.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=36}} Molotov became a member of the [[Petrograd Soviet|Military Revolutionary Committee]] which planned the [[October Revolution]] (effectively bringing the Bolsheviks to power).<ref>{{Cite book | author = Molotov, Vyacheslav; Chuev, Felix; Resis, Albert | title = Molotov remembers: inside Kremlin politics : conversations with Felix Chuev | publisher = I.R. Dee | year = 1993 | isbn = 1566630274 | page = 94 }}</ref>

In 1918, Molotov was sent to [[Ukraine]] to take part in [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] then breaking out. Since he was not a military man, Molotov took no part in the fighting. In 1920, he became secretary to the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Bolshevik Party. Lenin recalled him to Moscow in 1921, elevating him to full membership in the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] and [[Orgburo]], and putting him in charge of the party secretariat. He was voted in as a non-voting member of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] in 1921, and held the office of Party Secretary. His Party Secretaryship was criticised by both Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]], with Lenin criticising him for "shameful bureaucratism" and stupid behaviour.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=40}} On the advice of Molotov and [[Nikolai Bukharin]] the Central Committee decided to reduce Lenin's work hours.{{sfn|Service|2003|p=151}} In 1922, Stalin became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the Bolshevik Party with Molotov as the ''[[de facto]]'' [[Second Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Second Secretary]]. As a young follower Molotov admired Stalin, but was open about his criticism of him.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|pp=40<U+2013>41}} Under Stalin's patronage, Molotov became a member of the [[Politburo]] in 1926.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=36}}

During the power struggles which followed Lenin's death in 1924, Molotov remained a loyal supporter of Stalin against his various rivals: first [[Leon Trotsky]], later [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and finally [[Nikolai Bukharin]]. He became a leading figure in the "[[Stalinist]] centre" of the party, which also included [[Kliment Voroshilov]] and [[Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze|Sergo Ordzhonikidze]].{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|pp=36<U+2013>37}} Trotsky and his supporters underestimated Molotov as many others did. Trotsky called him "mediocrity personified", whilst Molotov himself pedantically corrected comrades referring to him as 'Stone-Arse' by saying that Lenin had actually dubbed him 'Iron Arse'.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=40}} However, this outward dullness concealed a sharp mind and great administrative talent. He operated mainly behind the scenes and cultivated an image as a colourless bureaucrat <U+2013> for example, he was the only Bolshevik leader who always wore a suit and tie.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Rywkin, Michael | title = Soviet Society Today | publisher = [[M.E. Sharpe]] | year = 1989 | pages = 159<U+2013>160 }}</ref> In 1928 Molotov replaced [[Nikolai Uglanov]] as [[First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party]] and held that position until 15 August 1929.{{sfn|Service|2003|p=176}} In a lengthy addresse to the Central Committee in 1929, Molotov told the members that the [[Soviet government]] would initiate a campaign compulsory collectivization to solve the agrarian backwardness of [[Soviet agriculture]].{{sfn|Service|2003|p=179}}

==Premiership (1930<U+2013>1941)==
[[File:Great Purge Stalin Voroshilov Kaganovich Zhdanov Molotov .jpg|thumb|A list from the [[Great Purge]] signed by Molotov, Stalin, [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]], [[Lazar Kaganovich|Kaganovich]] and [[Andrei Zhdanov|Zhdanov]]]]
During the Central Committee plenum of 19 December 1930 [[Alexey Rykov]], the [[List of Premiers of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (the equivalent of a Western [[head of government]]) was succeeded by Molotov.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|pp=63<U+2013>64}} In this post, he oversaw the Stalin regime's [[Collectivisation in the USSR|collectivisation of agriculture]]. Molotov carried out Stalin's line of using a combination of force and propaganda to crush peasant resistance to collectivisation, including the deportation of millions of ''[[kulak]]s'' (peasants with property) to [[labour camp]]s. An enormous number of the deportees died from exposure and overwork.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=47}} He signed the ''[[Law of Spikelets]]''{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=94}} and personally led the Extraordinary Commission for Grain Delivery in Ukraine,{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=46}} which seized a reported 4.2 million tonnes of grain from the peasants, during a widespread manmade [[famine]] (known in Ukraine as [[Holodomor]]).{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=94}} Contemporary historians estimate that between seven and eleven million people died, either of starvation or in labour camps,{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=94}} in the move to collectivise farms. Molotov also oversaw the implementation of the [[First Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|First]] [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plan]] for rapid industrialisation.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|pp=45 and 58}}

[[Sergei Kirov]] was killed in 1934,{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|pp=148<U+2013>149}} some believed his death was ordered by Stalin. Kirov's death triggered a second crisis, the [[Great Purge]].{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=71}} In 1938, out of the twenty-eighth [[People's Commissars]] in Molotov's Government, twenty of them were executed on the orders of Molotov and Stalin.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=244}} Although the purges were carried out by Stalin's successive police chiefs,{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=222}} it was [[Nikolai Yezhov]] who was the chief organiser behind, [[Kliment Voroshilov]], [[Lazar Kaganovich]] and Molotov were intimately involved in the processes.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=240}} Stalin frequently required him and other Politburo members to sign the death warrants of prominent purge victims, and Molotov always did so without question.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=237}} There is no record of Molotov attempting to moderate the course of the purges or even to save individuals, as some other Soviet officials did. During the [[Great Purge]], he personally approved 372 documented execution lists, more than any other Soviet official, including Stalin himself. It is known by fact that Molotov was one of few in which Stalin openly discussed the purges with.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=225}} Molotov, even after Stalin's death, supported the Great Purge and the murders committed by his government.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=260}} However, Molotov along with Stalin signed a decree in 1938 which disassociated them from the then ongoing Great Purge.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=289}}
[[File:SupremeSoviet.gif|left|thumb|Molotov at the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] in 1939 with Stalin and [[Georgy Malenkov]]]]
Despite the great human cost,{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=125}} the Soviet Union under Molotov's nominal premiership made great strides in the adoption and widespread implementation of agrarian and industrial technology. In a document written by Molotov he noted how [[cannibalism]] and [[starvation]] was still a serious problem even in 1937 in the Soviet Union. [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], the [[Procurator General of the Soviet Union|Procurator General]], even told Molotov personally of incidents involving mother's eating there newly-born children.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=236}} The rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] in [[Nazi Germany]] gave the development of a modern armaments industry on the orders of the [[Soviet government]].<ref>{{Cite book  | author = Scott Dunn, Walter | title = The Soviet economy and the Red Army, 1930-1945 | publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group]] | year = 1995 | isbn = 0275948935 | page = 22 }}</ref> Ultimately, it was this arms industry, along with American [[Lend-Lease]] aid, which helped the Soviet Union to prevail in [[World War II|Great Patriotic War]] (World War II).<ref>{{Cite book | author = William Davies, Robert; Harrison, Mark; Wheatcroft, S.G. | title = The Economic transformation of the Soviet Union, 1913-1945 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 1994 | isbn = 052145770X | pages = 250<U+2013>251 }}</ref> However, the purges of the [[Red Army]] leadership, in which Molotov participated, weakened the Soviet Union's defence capacity. This somewhat contributed to the military disasters of 1941 and 1942, which were mostly caused by unreadiness for war.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=65}} The purges also led to the dismantling of privatised agriculture and its replacement by collectivised agriculture. Collectivised agriculture left a legacy of chronic agricultural inefficiencies and under-production which the Soviet regime never fully solved.<ref>{{cite web | author = | title = Stalin's legacy | publisher = country-data.com | url = http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-12746.html | accessdate = 17 January 2011 }}</ref>

==Minister of Foreign Affairs (1939<U+2013>1949)==
[[Image:Molotov with Ribbentrop.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Molotov meets with [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] before signing the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact|German-Soviet non-aggression pact]]]]
In 1939, following the [[Munich Agreement]] and Hitler's subsequent invasion of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1938, Stalin believed that Britain and France would not be reliable allies against German expansion so instead sought to conciliate with [[Nazi Germany]].{{sfn|Brown|2009|pp=90<U+2013>91}} In May 1939 [[Maxim Litvinov]], the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs]] was dismissed, and Molotov was appointed to succeed him.{{sfn|Service|2003|p=256}} Molotov was succeeded by Stalin in his post as Premier. On 5 March 1940 [[Lavrentiy Beria]] gave Molotov, along with [[Anastas Mikoyan]], [[Kliment Voroshilov]] and Stalin, a note ordering the execution of 25,700 Polish officers and [[anti-Soviet]]s; the execution of these people is colloquially referred to as the [[Katyn massacre]].{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=141}}

At first, Hitler rebuffed Soviet diplomatic hints that Stalin desired a treaty, but in early August, he authorised Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] to begin serious negotiations. A trade agreement was concluded on 18 August, and on 22 August, Ribbentrop flew to [[Moscow]] to conclude a formal non-aggression treaty. Although the treaty is known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, Molotov and Ribbentrop acted only as agents for their masters, Stalin and Hitler. The most important part of the agreement was the secret protocol, which provided for the partition of [[Poland]], [[Finland]] and the [[Baltic States]] between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and for the Soviet annexation of [[Bessarabia]] (then part of [[Romania]], now [[Moldova]]).{{sfn|Service|2003|p=256}} This protocol gave Hitler the green light for his [[German invasion of Poland|invasion of Poland]], which began on 1 September.{{sfn|Brown|2009|pp=90<U+2013>92}}

Under the terms of the Pact, Stalin was, in effect, given authorisation to occupy and annex [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Bessarabia]], as well as the part of Poland east of the [[Curzon Line]] (an area in which [[Ukrainians|Ukrainians]] and [[Belarusians|Belorussians]] comprised the majority of the population). Molotov was given a free hand in relation to Finland. In the [[Soviet-Finnish War]] that ensued, a combination of fierce Finnish resistance and Soviet mismanagement resulted in Finland losing parts of its territory, but not its independence.{{sfn|Service|2003|pp=256<U+2013>257}} Germany was authorised to occupy the two-thirds of [[Western Poland]], as well as [[Lithuania]], but the Pact was later amended to allocate Lithuania to the Soviet sphere in exchange for a more favourable border in Poland. All these annexations led to massive suffering and loss of life in the countries which were occupied and partitioned by the two dictatorships.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|pp=320, 322 and 342}}

In November 1940 Stalin sent Molotov to [[Berlin]] to meet von Ribbentrop and [[Adolf Hitler]] (see [[German<U+2013>Soviet Axis talks#Molotov travels to Berlin]]). In January 1941, the British Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] visited Turkey in an attempt to get the Turks to enter the war on the Allied state. Through the purpose of Eden's visit was anti-German rather than anti-Soviet, Molotov assumed otherwise and in a series of conversations with the Italian Ambassador Augusto Rosso, Molotov claimed that the Soviet Union would soon be faced with an Anglo-Turkish invasion of the Crimea. The British historian D.C. Watt argued that on the basis of Molotov's statements to Rosso, it would appear that in early 1941 that Stalin and Molotov viewed Britain rather than Germany as the principal threat.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Cameron Watt, Donald | title = Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy | publisher = [[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 0415144353 | pages = 276<U+2013>286 }}</ref>

The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact governed Soviet-German relations until June 1941 when Hitler, having occupied [[France]] and neutralised the [[United Kingdom|Britain]], turned east and [[German invasion of the Soviet Union|attacked the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Service|2003|pp=158<U+2013>160}} Molotov was also responsible for telling the [[Soviet people]] of the attack, when he announced the war, instead of Stalin. His speech, broadcast by radio on 22 June, played in the Soviet Union a role similar to [[Winston Churchill]]'s wartime speeches in the Britain.{{sfn|Service|2003|p=261}} The [[State Defense Committee]] was established soon after Molotov's speech; Stalin was elected Chairman while Molotov was elected Deputy Chairman of the committee.{{sfn|Service|2003|p=262}}
Following the German invasion, Molotov conducted urgent negotiations with Britain and, later, the [[United States]] for wartime alliances. Via a secret flight which landed in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]; he was greeted by Foreign Secretary Eden. From there on he took a train to [[London]] to discuss with the [[British government]] the possibility of opening a "Second Front" against Germany. After signing the [[Anglo-Soviet Treaty of 1942]] on 26 May Molotov left for [[Washington, D.C.]], United States. Molotov met with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the [[President of the United States]], and ratified a [[Lend-Lease|Lend-Lease Treaty]] between the USSR and the US. Both the British and the [[United States government]], albeit vaguely, promised to open up a Second Front against Germany. On his flight back to the USSR his plane was first attacked by German fighters, and then later, Soviet fighters.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|pp=417<U+2013>418}}

When Beria told Stalin about the [[Manhattan Project]] and it's importance Stalin handpicked Molotov to be the man in charge of the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]]. However, under Molotov's leadership the bomb, and the project iself, developed very slowly and Molotov was therefore replaced by Beria in 1944 on the advice of [[Igor Kurchatov]].{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=508}} When [[Harry S. Truman]], the American President, told Stalin that the Americans had created a bomb never seen before Stalin responded by telling Molotov about the conversation. In the conversation with Molotov Stalin told him to speed up development, and the Soviet government on Stalin's orders increased the project's investments dramatically.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=510}}

Molotov accompanied Stalin to the [[Teheran Conference]] in 1943,{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=472}} the [[Yalta Conference]] in 1945{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=489}} and the [[Potsdam Conference]] in the same year, which followed the defeat of Germany.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=507}} He represented the [[Soviet Union]] at the [[San Francisco Conference]], which created the [[United Nations]].{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=477}} Even during the period of wartime alliance, Molotov was known as a tough negotiator and determined defender of Soviet interests. In this he was carrying out Stalin's wishes. From 1945 to 1947 Molotov took part in all four conferences of [[foreign minister]]s of the victorious states in the Great Patriotic War. In general, he was distinguished by an uncooperative attitude towards the Western powers. Molotov, on the direction of the Soviet government, condemned the [[Marshall Plan]] as imperialistic and claimed it was dividing Europe into two-camps, one capitalist one communist. The Soviet Union, along with the other [[Eastern Bloc]] nations, in response initiated what is known as the [[Molotov Plan]]. The plan created several [[bilateral relation]]s between the states of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union; the plan later evolved into the [[Comecon|Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (CMEA).<ref>{{Cite book | author = [[Geoffrey Roberts|Roberts, Geoffrey]] | title = The Soviet Union in world politics: coexistence, revolution, and cold war, 1945<U+2013>1991 | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1999 | isbn = 0415144353 | pages = 284<U+2013>285 }}</ref>

In the postwar period, Molotov's position began to decline. A clear sign of Molotov's precarious position was his inability to prevent the arrest of his Jewish wife, [[Polina Zhemchuzhina]], whom Stalin had long distrusted, in December 1948 for "[[treason]]".{{sfn|Brown|2009|pp=199<U+2013>201}} Molotov never stopped loving his wife, and it is said that he ordered his maids to make dinner for two every evening to remind him that, in his own words, that "she suffered because of me".{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=604}} The couple were reunited by Beria upon the death of Stalin.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=666}} In 1949, he was replaced as Foreign Minister by [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], although retaining his position as [[List of First Deputies of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Premier]] and membership on the Politburo. It was not only Molotov's position which was in decline, the very same he lost his foreign affairs ministership [[Anastas Mikoyan]] lost his post as [[Ministry of Foreign Trade (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Trade]].{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=604}}

==Post-war career (1949<U+2013>1976)==
At the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Party Congress]] in 1952, Molotov lost his seat in the [[Presidium]], but was voted into the newly-established secret body known as the [[Bureau of the Presidium]]; a body containing officials who had fallen out of Stalin's favour.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=231}} Anyhow when Stalin died on 5 March 1953 [[Georgy Malenkov]], Stalin's successor in the post of Premier, reappointed Molotov as Minister of Foreign Affairs.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=662}} At the 19th Congress Molotov and [[Anastas Mikoyan]] were told by Stalin to have committed grave mistakes. Notable mistakes including the publishing of a wartime speech by [[Winston Churchill]] favourable to the Soviet Union's war time efforts.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=640}} Both Molotov and Mikoyan were falling out of favour rapidly, with Stalin telling Beria, Khrushchev, Malenkov and [[Nikolai Bulganin]] that he did not want see Molotov and Mikoyan around anymore. At his 73rd birthday Stalin even treated both with disgust. {{sfn|Montefiore|2005|pp=645<U+2013>647}}

Following Stalin's death, a realignment of the leadership was sought, in the course of which Molotov's position was strengthened. Molotov was seen as a likely successor to Stalin in the immediate aftermath of his death, however, he never sought to become leader of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=227}} A [[Troika (triumvirate)|Troika]] was established immediatley after Stalin's death, the Troika consisted of Malenkov, Beria, and Molotov<ref name="againtroika">{{cite book | author = Marlowe, Lynn Elizabeth  | title = GED Social Studies: The Best Study Series for GED | publisher = Research and Education Association | year = 2005| location = | page = 140 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=NUHU3om46M4C&dq | isbn = 0738601276 }}</ref> but ended when Malenkov and Molotov deceived Beria.<ref>{{cite book | author = [[William Taubman|Taubman, William]] | year = 2003 | title = Khrushchev: The Man and His Era | publisher = [[W.W.

He presided over a gradual domestic liberalisation and a thaw in foreign policy, shown by the reconciliation with [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s government in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (which Stalin had expelled from the communist movement). Molotov, an old-guard Stalinist, seemed increasingly out of place in this new environment,{{sfn|Brown|2009|pp=236<U+2013>237}} but he represented the Soviet Union at the [[Geneva Conference (1955)|Geneva Conference of 1955]].<ref>{{Cite book | author = Bischof, G<U+00FC>nter; Dockrill, Saki | title = Cold War respite: the Geneva Summit of 1955 | publisher = [[Louisiana State University Press]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 0807123706 | pages = 284<U+2013>285 }}</ref>

The events which led to Molotov's downfall began in February 1956 when Khrushchev launched an unexpected denunciation of Stalin at the [[20th Party Congress|20th Congress]] of the Communist Party. Khrushchev attacked Stalin, both over the purges of the 1930s and the defeats of the early years of Great Patriotic War, which he blamed on Stalin's over-trusting attitude to Hitler and the purges of the Red Army. Since Molotov was most senior of Stalin's collaborators still alive and had played a leading role in the purges, it became obvious that Khrushchev's examination into the past would probably result in Molotov's fall from power. Consequently, he became the leader of the old guard which tried to overthrow Khrushchev.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|pp=666<U+2013>667}}

In June 1956, Molotov was removed as Foreign Minister,{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=245}} and in June 1957 was expelled from the Presidium (Politburo) following a failed attempt to remove Khrushchev as First Secretary. Although Molotov's faction initially won a vote in the Presidium, 7-4, to remove Khrushchev, the latter refused to resign unless a Central Committee plenum decided so.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=252}} In the plenum, which lasted from 22<U+2013>29 June, Molotov and his faction were defeated.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|pp=666<U+2013>667}} Eventually he was banished as ambassador to [[Mongolian People's Republic]].{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=252}} In 1960, he was appointed Soviet representative to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], which was seen as a partial rehabilitation.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=668}} However, after the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|22nd Party Congress]] in 1961, during which Khrushchev carried his [[de-Stalinisation]] campaign to remove Stalin's body from [[Lenin's Mausoleum]], Molotov along with [[Lazar Kaganovich]] was removed from all positions and expelled from the Communist Party.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=231}} In 1962 all of Molotov's party documents and files were erased by the authorities.{{sfn|Goudoever|1986|p=100}} 

In retirement, Molotov remained totally unrepentant regarding his role during Stalin's rule.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=669}} After the [[Sino-Soviet split]], it was reported that he agreed with the criticisms made by [[Mao Zedong]] of the supposed "[[Marxist revisionism|revisionism]]" of Khrushchev's policies. According to [[Roy Medvedev]], Stalin's daughter [[Svetlana Alliluyeva|Svetlana]] recalled Molotov and his wife telling her: "Your father was a genius. There's no revolutionary spirit around nowadays, just opportunism everywhere.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Nikolaevna Vasil<U+02B9>eva, Larisa | title = Kremlin wives | location = | publisher = [[Arcade Publishing]] | year = 1994 | page = 159 }}</ref> China's our only hope.

<blockquote>"The fact that atomic war may break out, isn't that class struggle? There is no alternative to class struggle. This is a very serious question. The be-all and end-all is not [[peaceful coexistence]]. After all, we have been holding on for some time, and under Stalin we held on to the point where the imperialists felt able to demand point-blank: either surrender such and such positions, or it means war. So far the imperialists haven't renounced that."</blockquote>

==Rehabilitation, death, beliefs and legacy==
[[File:Novodevicij Cemetery Vyacheslav Molotov 02.JPG|150px|thumb|Molotov's grave at Novodevichy cemetery]]
The [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitation]] of Molotov began in 1973, during [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s rule, when information about him was again allowed inclusion in Soviet [[encyclopaedia]]s. His connection, support and work in the [[Anti-Party Group]] was mentioned in encyclopaedias published in 1973 and 1974, but eventually disappeared all together by the mid-to-late-1970s. Soviet leader [[Konstantin Chernenko]] further rehabiliated Molotov, in 1984 Molotov was even allowed to seek a membership in the Communist Party.{{sfn|Goudoever|1986|p=108}} A collection of interviews with Molotov from 1985 was published in 1994 by Felix Chuev as ''Molotov Remembers: Inside Kremlin Politics''. Molotov died, during the rule of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], on 8 November 1986. He was 96 years old at the time of his death. He was buried at the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]], [[Moscow]].{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=669}}

Molotov, just as Stalin, was [[pathologically]] mistrustful of others, and because of it, much crucial information disappeared. As Molotov once said "One should listen to them, but it is necessary to check up on them. The intelligence officer can lead you to a very dangerous position... There are many provocatuers here, there, and everywhere."{{sfn|Zubok|Pleshakov|1996|p=88}} Another belief he shared with Stalin was that he never recognised the [[Cold War]] as an international event. Molotov saw the Cold War as, more-or-less, the everyday conflict between [[communism]] and [[capitalism]]. It is important to note that Molotov divided the capitalist countries into two groups, the "smart and dangerous [[imperialists]]" and the "[[fools]]".{{sfn|Zubok|Pleshakov|1996|p=89}} Molotov was also a staunch Russian [[nationalist]], claiming that Russians unlike the [[Hungarians]], liked "to do things large-scale". Since his forceful retirement Molotov saw [[Nikita Khrushchev]] as a "[[right-wing]] deviationist".{{sfn|Zubok|Pleshakov|1996|p=90}} Before his retirement Molotov even proposed establishing a socialist confederation with the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC); Molotov believed [[socialist state]]s were part of a bigger, [[Supranational union|supranational entity]].{{sfn|Zubok|Pleshakov|1996|pp=90<U+2013>91}}

At the end of 1989, two years before the final collapse of the Soviet Union, the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s government formally denounced the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, acknowledging that the bloody annexation of the Baltic States and the partition of Poland had been illegal.<ref>{{Cite book | author = W.

Acknowledging him as a "man of outstanding ability and cold-blooded ruthlessness", Churchill concluded: "In the conduct of foreign affairs, [[Mazarin]], [[Talleyrand]], [[Metternich]], would welcome him to their company, if there be another world to which Bolsheviks allow themselves to go."<ref>{{Cite book | author = [[Winston Churchill|Churchill, Winston]] | title = [[The Second World War (book)|The Gathering Storm]] | publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] | volume = 1 | year = 1948 | isbn = 039541055X | pages = 368<U+2013>369 }}</ref>
