==History==
[[Korea]] was introduced to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (also known as the Mormon or LDS Church) by church members serving in the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]] during the [[Korean War]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The first Korean member of the Church was [[Kim Ho Jik]]. Kim joined the Church in July 1951 while obtaining his doctorate at [[Cornell University]].<ref>Palmer, Spencer J. "Kim Ho Jik" in Garr, Arnold K., Donald Q. Cannon and Richard O. Cowan, ed., ''Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History''. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2000) p. 613</ref>

After finishing his doctorate he returned to Korea and served as the Minister of Education in the [[Syngman Rhee]] administration.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} As an influential figure in education and the community, he served in the Church and contributed immensely to the growth of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the country of [[South Korea]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

During the Korean War, Korean citizens who worshiped with U.S. military servicemen at LDS Church services in Pusan and Seoul began to be baptized members of the Church.

[[Elder (Mormonism)|Elders]] [[Don G. Powell]] and [[Richard L. Detton]], the first missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were sent to the Republic of Korea (South Korea) on April 20th 1956.   

In 1967 the first Korean version of The [[Book of Mormon]]: Another Testament of Jesus Christ was published.

April 14th 1985, the [[Seoul Korea Temple|Korean Temple]] for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was dedicated. In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, there is a distinction between a meeting house and a [[Temple (Mormonism)|Temple]]. By 1985 there were numerous meeting houses or <U+201C>churches<U+201D> for the members of the Church to worship in, but this was the first, and as of 2006 the only, Temple for the Church in Korea.

Currently The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has approximately 76,000 members and 450 full time [[Mormon missionary|missionaries]] serving in at least 4 [[Missions of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|missions]] in the Republic of Korea.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
