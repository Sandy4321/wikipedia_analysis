He became known after going to [[Iraq]] and being accused by [[United States]] and Jordanian officials for a series of bombings, beheadings and attacks during the [[Iraq War]]. 

He was believed to have formed al-Tawhid wal-Jihad, which later became the group called [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq]], in the 1990s, and led it until his death in June 2006. Zarqawi took responsibility, on several audio- and videotapes, for numerous acts of violence in [[Iraq]] including [[suicide bombing]]s and [[hostage]] executions.
Zarqawi opposed the presence of U.S. and Western military forces in the Islamic world as well as the West's support for and the existence of Israel. In late 2004 he joined al-Qaeda and pledged allegiance to Osama bin Laden. 

In September 2005, he reportedly declared "all-out war" on [[Shi'a Islam|Shia]] in Iraq in response to the Shia government offensive on the Sunni town of Tal Afar.<ref name="aljazeera">{{cite news|url = http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/407AAE91-AF72-45D7-83E9-486063C0E5EA.htm|work = [[Al Jazeera]]|title = Al-Zarqawi declares war on Iraqi Shia|date = [[September 14]] [[2005]] }}</ref> He is believed responsible for dispatching numerous suicide bombers throughout Iraq to attack American soldiers and areas with large concentrations of Shia militias.

"[[Abu (Arabic term)|Abu]] Musab" literally translates to "Musab's father", while the surname "[[al-]]Zarqawi" translates as "man from Zarqa".

There was no gray area,"  a former prison mate told ''Time'' magazine in 2004. According to some reports,{{Who|date=June 2007}} Zarqawi became a feared leader among inmates there. In prison he met and befriended Jordanian journalist [[Fouad Hussein]], who, in 2005, published a book on Zarqawi and al-Qaeda's strategy.

According to ''Perspectives on World History and Current Events'' (PWHCE), a not-for-profit project based in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], "Zarqawi was well positioned to lead the Islamic wing of the insurgency when the [[March 2003]] invasion took place.

== Alleged attacks ==
=== Attacks outside Iraq ===

Zarqawi's first major attempt at a terrorist attack occurred in 1999 after his release from prison. He was involved in an attempt to blow up the [[Radisson Hotels & Resorts|Radisson]] SAS Hotel in Amman in 1999 because it was frequented by many Israeli and American tourists.<ref name="building terror network">{{cite news|title=Zarqawi building his own terror network|date=[[October 3]] [[2004]]|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04277/388966.stm}}</ref> He failed in this attempt and fled to Afghanistan and then entered Iraq via Iran after the overthrow of the Taliban in late 2001. From Iraq he started his terrorist campaign by hiring men to kill [[Laurence Foley]] who was a senior U.S. diplomat working for the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] in Jordan. On [[October 28]], [[2002]], Foley was [[assassin]]ated outside his home in Amman. Under [[interrogation]] by Jordanian authorities, three suspects confessed that they had been armed and paid by Zarqawi to perform the assassination. U.S. officials believe that the planning and execution of the Foley assassination was led by members of Afghan Jihad, the International Mujaheddin Movement, and [[al-Qaeda]]. One of the leaders, Salim Sa'd Salim Bin-Suwayd, was paid over $27,858 U.S. dollars for his work in planning assassinations in Jordan against U.S., Israeli, and Jordanian government officials. Suwayd was arrested in Jordan for the murder of Foley.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/zarqawi.htm | title=Jamaat al-Tawhid wa'l-Jihad / Unity and Jihad Group | publisher=GlobalSecurity.org}}</ref>  Zarqawi was again sentenced ''in absentia'' in Jordan; this time, as before, his sentence was death.<ref name="Loretta">{{cite news| url=http://www.antiwar.com/orig/napoleoni.php?articleid=7988| publisher=Time.com| title=The Myth of Zarqawi| date=[[November 11]] [[2005]]| first=Loretta| last=Napoleoni| accessdate=2006-06-20}}</ref>

The speaker states that the murder was in retaliation for US abuses at the [[Abu Ghraib prison]] (see [[Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal]]).<ref name="bbc5">{{cite news | title='Zarqawi' beheaded US man in Iraq | date=[[May 13]] [[2004]] | publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3712421.stm }}</ref> However, the CIA analysis failed to quell doubts about the validity of the claim because the man wears a mask in the video and did not resemble Zarqawi in other ways.<ref>{{cite news |first=Richard|last=Neville|title=Who killed Nick Berg?|date=[[May 29]] [[2004]]|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/05/28/1085641717320.html }}</ref> Various Middle East correspondents and experts, including [[CNN]]'s Octavia Nasr, have stated that the person talking on the Berg tape was not al-Zarqawi because he did not speak with a Jordanian accent. Following the death of al-Zarqawi, CNN spoke with Nicholas' father and long-time anti-war activist [[Michael Berg]], who stated that al-Zarqawi's killing would lead to further vengeance and was not a cause for rejoicing.<ref>{{cite news|title=  Beheaded man's father: Revenge breeds revenge|publisher=CNN| date=[[June 8]] [[2006]] | url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/06/08/berg.interview/}}</ref>

Zarqawi is also believed to have personally beheaded another American civilian, [[Eugene Armstrong|Olin Eugene Armstrong]], in September 2004[http://www.talkleft.com/story/2004/09/20/897/96639]]

Zarqawi is believed by the former [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] in Iraq to have written an intercepted letter to the al-Qaeda leadership in [[February 2004]] on the progress of the "Iraqi [[jihad]]." However, al-Qaeda denied they had written the letter.<ref>{{cite news|first=David and James|last=Ensor and McIntyre|title=Al Qaeda in Iraq: Letter to al-Zarqawi a fake |date=[[October 13]] [[2005]]|publisher=CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/10/13/alqaeda.letter/ }}</ref> The [[U.S. military]] believes Zarqawi organized the [[February 2006]] attack on the [[al-Askari Mosque bombing (2006)|Al Askari Mosque]] in [[Samarra]], in an attempt to trigger [[sectarian violence]] between [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]] and [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'ites]] in Iraq.<ref>{{cite news|title=  New ops planned in wake of Zarqawi hunt|[[June 9]] [[2006]]|publisher=[[United Press International]] | url= http://washingtontimes.com/upi/20060608-025601-3434r.htm }}</ref> 

In a January 2005 [[internet]] recording, Zarqawi condemned [[democracy]] as "the big American lie" and said participants in [[Iraqi legislative election, January 2005|Iraq's January 30 election]] were enemies of [[Islam]].  Zarqawi stated "We have declared a bitter war against democracy and all those who seek to enact it...Democracy is also based on the right to choose your religion [and that is] against the rule of God."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/01/23/iraq.main/index.html | title=Purported al-Zarqawi tape: Democracy a lie | publisher=CNN | date=January 23, 2005}}</ref>

U.S. experts told the [[BBC]] they believed the recording was genuine. One part of the recording shows a man - who bears a strong resemblance to previous pictures of Zarqawi - sitting on the floor and addressing a group of masked men with an automatic rifle at his side. "Your mujahideen sons were able to confront the most ferocious of crusader campaigns on a Muslim state," the man says. Addressing U.S. President George W. Bush, he says: "Why don't you tell people that your soldiers are committing suicide, taking drugs and hallucination pills to help them sleep?" "By God," he says, "your dreams will be defeated by our blood and by our bodies. What is coming is even worse." The speaker in the video also reproaches the U.S. for its "arrogance and insolence" in rejecting a truce offered by "our prince and leader", Osama Bin Laden. The United States Army aired an unedited tape of Zarqawi in [[May 2006]] highlighting the fact that he did not know how to fix a jam on his [[M249 Squad Automatic Weapon]]. Zarqawi was also shown to be wearing [[New Balance]] [[tennis shoes]] in the video, which contradicts his anti-American beliefs while indicating a lack of more rugged, durable boot.<ref>{{cite web|title=Abu Musab al-Zarqawi video bloopers|work=[[YouTube]] | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ry674K_T2U | accessdate=2006-06-09}} </ref> The aim of the video was to remove the myth surrounding Zarqawi and to question his prowess as a military leader.

A document found in Zarqawi's safe house indicates that the group was trying to provoke the U.S. to attack Iran in order to reinvigorate the insurgency in Iraq and to weaken American forces in Iraq.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2006-06-15-zarqawi-text_x.htm|title= Text of a document found in Zarqawi's safe house| date=6/15/2006| accessdate=2006-06-20| publisher=USA Today}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2006-06-15-raid-blueprint_x.htm| title=Iraqi leaders: Memo details al-Qaeda plans| date=[[June 15]] [[2006]]|first=Cesar| last=Soriano| publisher=USA Today| accessdate=2006-06-20}}</ref> "The question remains, how to draw the Americans into fighting a war against Iran?

==Alleged links to al-Qaeda==
After the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|2001 war in Afghanistan]], Zarqawi appeared on a U.S. list of most-wanted al-Qaeda terrorists still at large in early 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/09/AR2006060901578_pf.html|title=Zarqawi Helped U.S. Argument That Al-Qaeda Network Was in Iraq|publisher=Washington Post|author=Karen DeYoung and Walter Pincus|date=June 10, 2006}}</ref>  It was reported he received the equivalent of US$5000 for his activities from Osama bin Laden.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}

According to the [[Washington Post]] and some other sources, he formally swore loyalty ([[Bay'ah]]) to bin Laden in October 2004 and was in turn appointed bin Laden's deputy. Zarqawi then changed the name of his Monotheism and Jihad network to "al-Qaeda in Iraq," <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/09/AR2006060902040.html|title=Death Could Shake Al-Qaeda In Iraq and Around the World|publisher=Washington Post|author=Craig Whitlock|date=June 10, 2006}}</ref>(''Tamzim al-Qaeda wa'l-Jihad fi Balad al-Rafidayn'')<ref>Nasr, Vali, ''Shia Revival'', (Norton, 2006), p.241</ref>

===Pre U.S. Invasion of Iraq===
Before the invasion of Afghanistan, Zarqawi was the leader of an Islamic militant group affiliated with al-Qaeda. In an interview on ''Al-Majd TV'', former al-Qaeda member Walid Khan, who was in Afghanistan fighting alongside Zarqawi's group explained that from the day al-Zarqawi's group arrived, there were disagreements, differences of opinion with bin Laden.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=countries&Area=saudiarabia&ID=SP104205 | title=Saudi Al-Qaeda Terrorists Recount Their Experiences in Afghanistan on Saudi TV and Arab Channels | publisher=MEMRI | date=December 7, 2005}}</ref>  Saif al-Adel, now bin Laden's military chief, was an Egyptian who attempted to overthrow the Egyptian government saw merit in Zarqawi's overall objective of overthrowing the Jordanian monarchy.

Zarqawi's group continued to received funding from Osama bin Laden and pursued "a largely distinct, if occasionally overlapping agenda," according to ''[[The Washington Post]].''<ref name="Path to Power">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2004/09/27/AR2005040209346.html | title=Grisly Path to Power In Iraq's Insurgency: Zarqawi Emerges as Al Qaeda Rival, Ally | publisher=Washington Post | author=Craig Whitlock | date=September 27, 2004}}</ref>  Counterterrorism experts told the ''Washington Post'' that while Zarqawi accepted al-Qaeda's financial help to set up a training camp in Afghanistan he ran it independently and while bin Laden was planning September 11, Zarqawi was busy developing a plot to topple the Jordanian monarchy and attack Israel.<ref name="Death could shake world">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/09/AR2006060902040.html | title=Death Could Shake Al-Qaeda In Iraq and Around the World | publisher=Washington Post | author=Craig Whitlock | date=June 10, 2006}}</ref> 

Nixon Center terrorism experts [[Robert S. Leiken]] and Steven Brooke explained that Zarqawi never meant to join al Qaeda.   Militants have explained that Tawhid was especially for Jordanians who did not want to join al Qaeda. Even a confessed Tawhid member told his interrogators that Zarqawi was against al Qaeda.<ref name="Nixon Center">{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/18/opinion/main618114.shtml | title=Who Is Abu Zarqawi?: What We Know About The Terrorist Leader Who Murdered Nick Berg | publisher=Weekly Standard | author=Robert S.

He could not come up with ready cash. Told that he did not belong to Tawhid, he was sent packing and eventually into the arms of the Americans.

The ''Washington Post'' also reported that German Intelligence wiretaps found that in the fall of 2001 that Zarqawi grew angry when his members were raising money in Germany for al-Qaeda's local leadership. "If something should come from their side, simply do not accept it," Zarqawi told one of his followers, according to a recorded conversation that was played at a trial of four alleged Zarqawi operatives in [[Duesseldorf]].<ref name="Path to Power">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2004/09/27/AR2005040209346.html | title=Grisly Path to Power In Iraq's Insurgency: Zarqawi Emerges as Al Qaeda Rival, Ally | publisher=Washington Post | author=Craig Whitlock | date=September 27, 2004}}</ref>

At least five times, in 2000 and 2001, bin Laden called al-Zarqawi to come to Kandahar and pay ''bayat'' <U+2014> take an oath of allegiance<U+2014>to him. Each time, al-Zarqawi refused. Under no circumstances did he want to become involved in the battle between the Northern Alliance and the Taliban. He also did not believe that either bin Laden or the Taliban was serious enough about jihad.  When the United States launched its air war inside Afghanistan, on October 7, 2001, al-Zarqawi joined forces with al-Qaeda and the Taliban for the first time. He and his Jund al-Sham fought in and around Herat and Kandahar.<ref>Mary Ann Weaver, "Inventing al-Zarqawi," ''Atlantic Monthly'' (July/August 2006) p. 96.</ref> When Zarqawi finally did take the oath in October 2004, after eight months of negotiations.<ref>Mary Ann Weaver, "Inventing al-Zarqawi," ''Atlantic Monthly'' (July/August 2006) p. 98.</ref>

In April 2007, former [[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[George Tenet]] released his [[memoir]] titled ''[[At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA]]''.  In the book he reveals that in July 2001, an associate of Zarqawi had been detained and, during interrogations, linked Zarqawi with al-Qaeda operative [[Abu Zubaydah]].<ref>{{cite news | title=At the Center of the Storm: My years at the CIA | publisher=HarperCollins | author=George Tenet | page=157}}</ref>  Tenet also wrote in his book that Thirwat Shihata and Yussef Dardiri, "assessed by a senior al-Qa'ida detainee to be among the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad|Egyptian Islamic Jihad's]] best operational planners," arrived in Baghdad in May 2002 and were engaged in "sending recruits to train in Zarqawi's camps."<ref name = "Tenet_p351">{{cite news | title=At the Center of the Storm: My years at the CIA | publisher=HarperCollins | author=George Tenet | page=351}}</ref>

===Post U.S. Invasion of Iraq===
During or shortly before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq in March 2003]], Zarqawi returned to Iraq, where he met with Bin Laden's military chief, Saif al-Adel (Muhammad Ibrahim Makawi), who asked him to coordinate the entry of al-Qaeda operatives into Iraq through Syria.<ref name="Gary Gambill">{{cite news | url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=400&issue_id=3179&article_id=2369019 | title=ABU MUSAB AL-ZARQAWI: A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH | publisher=The Jamestown Foundation | author=Gary Gambill | date=December 16, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=15900 | title=Total war: Inside the new Al-Qaeda | publisher=Middle East Online | date=2006-03-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2092-2058597_3,00.html | title=Total war: Inside the new Al-Qaeda | publisher=The Sunday Times | date=February 26, 2006}}</ref> Zarqawi readily agreed and by the fall of 2003 a steady flow of Arab Islamists were infiltrating Iraq via Syria. Although many of these foreign fighters were not members of Tawhid, they became more or less dependent on Zarqawi's local contacts once they entered the unfamiliar country. Moreover, given Tawhid's superior intelligence gathering capability, it made little sense for non-Tawhid operatives to plan and carry out attacks without coordinating with Zarqawi's lieutenants.<ref name="Gary Gambill">{{cite news | url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=400&issue_id=3179&article_id=2369019 | title=ABU MUSAB AL-ZARQAWI: A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH | publisher=The Jamestown Foundation | author=Gary Gambill | date=December 16, 2004}}</ref>  Consequentially, Zarqawi came to be recognized as the regional "emir" of Islamist terrorists in Iraq without having sworn fealty to bin Laden.<ref name="Gary Gambill">{{cite news | url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=400&issue_id=3179&article_id=2369019 | title=ABU MUSAB AL-ZARQAWI: A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH | publisher=The Jamestown Foundation | author=Gary Gambill | date=December 16, 2004}}</ref>

U.S. intelligence intercepted a [[January 2004]] letter from Zarqawi to al Qaeda and American officials made it public in [[February 2004]].  In the letter to bin Laden, Zarqawi wrote:
{{cquote|You, gracious brothers, are the leaders, guides, and symbolic figures of jihad and battle.

This is our vision, and we have explained it. This is our path, and we have made it clear. If you agree with us on it, if you adopt it as a program and road, and if you are convinced of the idea of fighting the sects of apostasy, we will be your readied soldiers, working under your banner, complying with your orders, and indeed swearing fealty to you publicly and in the news media, vexing the infidels and gladdening those who preach the oneness of God.

In [[October 2004]], a message on an Islamic Web site posted in the name of the spokesman of Zarqawi's group announced that Zarqawi had sworn his network's allegiance to Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda.  The message stated that:
{{cquote|Numerous messages were passed between <U+2018>Abu Musab' (God protect him) and the al-Qaeda brotherhood over the past eight months, establishing a dialogue between them.

Let it be known that al-Tawhid wal-Jihad pledges both its leaders and its soldiers to the mujahid commander, Sheikh 'Osama bin Laden' (in word and in deed) and to jihad for the sake of God until there is no more discord [among the ranks of Islam] and all of the religion turns toward God...By God, O sheikh of the mujahideen, if you bid us plunge into the ocean, we would follow you.

In May 2007, President Bush declassified a U.S. intelligence report that stated that bin Laden had enlisted Zarqawi to plan strikes inside the U.S., and warned that in January 2005 bin Laden had assigned Zarqawi to organize a cell inside Iraq that would be used to plan and carry out attacks against the U.S.  "Bin Laden tasked the terrorist Zarqawi ... with forming a cell to conduct terrorist attacks outside of Iraq," the president stated in a commencement address at the [[Coast Guard Academy]].

===Terrorism experts' view on the alliance===
According to experts, Zarqawi gave al-Qaeda a highly visible presence in Iraq at a time when its original leaders went into hiding or were killed after the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States.<ref name="Death could shake world">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/09/AR2006060902040.html | title=Death Could Shake Al-Qaeda In Iraq and Around the World | publisher=Washington Post | author=Craig Whitlock | date=June 10, 2006}}</ref> He established al-Qaeda's first military beachhead and training camps outside Afghanistan and by using the al-Qaeda name, Zarqawi bolstered his legitimacy and attracted media attention, as well as money and recruits.<ref name="Death could shake world">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/09/AR2006060902040.html | title=Death Could Shake Al-Qaeda In Iraq and Around the World | publisher=Washington Post | author=Craig Whitlock | date=June 10, 2006}}</ref> In turn, al-Qaeda leaders were able to brand a new franchise in Iraq and claim they were at the forefront of the fight to expel U.S. forces.<ref name="Death could shake world">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/09/AR2006060902040.html | title=Death Could Shake Al-Qaeda In Iraq and Around the World | publisher=Washington Post | author=Craig Whitlock | date=June 10, 2006}}</ref> But this relationship was proven to be fragile as Zarqawi angered al-Qaeda leaders by focusing attackings on Iraqi Shia's more often than U.S. military.

===U.S. officials' view on the alliance===
In [[June 2004]], Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] conceded that Zarqawi<U+2019>s ties to Al Qaeda may have been much more ambiguous<U+2014>and that he may have been more a rival than a lieutenant to bin Laden. Zarqawi "may very well not have sworn allegiance to [bin Laden]," Rumsfeld said at a Pentagon briefing. "Maybe he disagrees with him on something, maybe because he wants to be <U+2018>The Man<U+2019> himself and maybe for a reason that<U+2019>s not known to me." Rumsfeld added that, "someone could legitimately say he<U+2019>s not Al Qaeda."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5280219/site/newsweek | title=The World<U+2019>s Most Dangerous Terrorist: Who is Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi?

According to the Senate Report on Prewar Intelligence released in [[September 2006]], "in [[April 2003]] the CIA learned from a senior al-Qa'ida detainee that al-Zarqawi had rebuffed several efforts by bin Ladin to recruit him.  The detainee claimed that al-Zarqawi had religious differences with bin Ladin and disagreed with bin Ladin's singular focus against the United States.  The CIA assessed in April 2003 that al-Zarqawi planned and directed independent terrorist operations without al Qaeda direction, but assessed that he 'most likely contracts out his network's services to al Qaeda in return for material and financial assistance from key al Qaeda facilitators.'"[http://intelligence.senate.gov/phaseiiaccuracy.pdf (page 90)]   

In the [[April 2006]] [[National Intelligence Estimate]], declassified in September 2006, it asserts that "Al-Qa<U+2019>ida, now merged with Abu Mus<U+2019>ab al-Zarqawi<U+2019>s network, is exploiting the situation in Iraq to attract new recruits and donors and to maintain its leadership role."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/Declassified_NIE_Key_Judgments.pdf | title=Declassified Key Judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate "Trends in Global Terrorism: Implications for the United States" dated April 2006}}</ref>

==Alleged links to Saddam Hussein==
[[Image:Powell UN Iraq presentation, alleged Terrorist Network.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Colin Powell's U.N. presentation slide showing Al-Zarqawi's alleged global terrorist network.]]
On [[February 5]], [[2003]], then Secretary of State Colin Powell addressed the [[United Nations Security Council and the Iraq War|U.N. Security Council on the issue of Iraq]].  Regarding Zarqawi, Powell asserted that:
{{cquote|Iraq today harbors a deadly terrorist network headed by Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, an associated in collaborator of Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda lieutenants. When our coalition ousted the Taliban, the Zarqawi network helped establish another poison and explosive training center camp. And this camp is located in northeastern Iraq. He traveled to Baghdad in [[May 2002]] for medical treatment, staying in the capital of Iraq for two months while he recuperated to fight another day. During this stay, nearly two dozen extremists converged on Baghdad and established a base of operations there. These Al Qaeda affiliates, based in Baghdad, now coordinate the movement of people, money and supplies into and throughout Iraq for his network, and they've now been operating freely in the capital for more than eight months. We asked a friendly security service to approach Baghdad about extraditing Zarqawi and providing information about him and his close associates. This service contacted Iraqi officials twice, and we passed details that should have made it easy to find Zarqawi. The network remains in Baghdad.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/02/20030205-1.html | title = U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell Addresses the U.N.

Abu Musab al Zarqawi allegedly recuperated in Baghdad after being wounded while fighting along with [[Taliban]] and al-Qaeda fighters resisting the United States invasion of Afghanistan.<ref name="Zarqawi in Baghdad">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/08/AR2006060800299.html?nav=rss_world/africa |title=Al-Zarqawi's Biography|publisher=Washington Post|author=Craig Whitlock|date=June 8, 2006}}</ref>   According to the 2004 [[Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq]], "A foreign government service asserted that the IIS (Iraqi Intelligence Service) knew where al-Zarqawi was located despite Baghdad<U+2019>s claims that it could not find him."[http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/13jul20041400/www.gpoaccess.gov/serialset/creports/pdf/s108-301/sec12.pdf page 337]  The Senate Report on Prewar Intelligence also stated "As indicated in Iraqi Support for Terrorism, the Iraqi regime was, at a minimum, aware of al-Zarqawi<U+2019>s presence in Baghdad in 2002 because a foreign government service passed information regarding his whereabouts to Iraqi authorities in June 2002. Despite Iraq<U+2019>s pervasive security apparatus and its receipt of detailed information about al-Zarqawi's possible location, however, Iraqi Intelligence told the foreign government service it could not locate al-Zarqawi."[http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/13jul20041400/www.gpoaccess.gov/serialset/creports/pdf/s108-301/sec12.pdf page 338] 

=== Jordanian analysis ===
A Jordanian security official told the ''Washington Post'' that documents recovered after the [[Invasion of Iraq|overthrow of Saddam]] show that Iraqi agents detained some of Zarqawi's operatives but released them after questioning.  He also told the ''Washington Post'' that the Iraqis warned the Zarqawi operatives that the Jordanians knew where they were.<ref name="Zarqawi in Baghdad">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/08/AR2006060800299.html?nav=rss_world/africa | title=Al-Zarqawi's Biography | publisher=Washington Post | author=Craig Whitlock | date=June 8, 2006}}</ref>  The official also told the ''Washington Post'' that "'We sent many memos to Iraq during this time, asking them to identify his position, where he was, how he got weapons, how he smuggled them across the border,' but Hussein's government never responded."  

This claim was reiterated by Jordanian King [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah II]] in an interview with ''[[Al-Hayat]]''.  Abdullah revealed that [[Saddam Hussein]] had  rejected repeated requests from Jordan to hand over al-Zarqawi.  According to Abdullah, "We had information that he entered Iraq from a neighboring country, where he lived and what he was doing. We informed the Iraqi authorities about all this detailed information we had, but they didn<U+2019>t respond."  King Abdullah told the ''Al-Hayat'' that Jordan exerted "big efforts" with Saddam<U+2019>s government to extradite al-Zarqawi, but added that "our demands that the former regime hand him over were in vain.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2005/May/middleeast_May570.xml&section=middleeast&col= | title=Saddam refused to hand Zarqawi to Jordan: King Abdullah | publisher=Khaleej Times Online | date=19 May 2005}}</ref>
  
One high-level Jordanian intelligence official told the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' that al-Zarqawi, after leaving Afghanistan in December 2001, frequently traveled to the Sunni Triangle of Iraq where he expanded his network, recruited and trained new fighters, and set up bases, safe houses, and military training camps.  He said, however, "We know Zarqawi better than he knows himself.  And I can assure you that he never had any links to Saddam."<ref>Mary Ann Weaver, "Inventing al-Zarqawi," p. 96.</ref> 

Counterterrorism scholar [[Loretta Napoleoni]] quotes former Jordanian parliamentarian Layth Shubaylat, who was personally acquainted with both Zarqawi and Saddam Hussein:
{{cquote|First of all, I don't think the two ideologies go together, I'm sure the former Iraqi leadership saw no interest in contacting al-Zarqawi or al-Qaeda operatives.  The mentality of al-Qaeda simply doesn't go with the Ba'athist one.

=== U.S. conclusion ===
A CIA report in late 2004 concluded that there was no evidence Saddam's government was involved or even aware of this medical treatment, and found no conclusive evidence the Saddam Hussein regime had harbored Zarqawi.  A US official told ''[[Reuters]]'' that the report was a mix of new information and a look at some older information and did not make any final judgments or come to any definitive conclusions. "To suggest the case is closed on this would not be correct," the official said."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6189795/ | title=CIA report finds no Zarqawi-Saddam link | publisher=Reuters | date=October 6, 2004}}</ref>  A US official familiar with the report told [[Knight-Ridder]] that "what is indisputable is that Zarqawi was operating out of Baghdad and was involved in a lot of bad activities."  Another U.S. official summarized the report as such: "The evidence is that Saddam never gave Zarqawi anything."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/1005-01.htm | title=CIA Review Finds No Evidence Saddam Had Ties to Islamic Terrorists | publisher=Knight-Ridder | author=Warren P. Strobel, Jonathan S. Landay and John Walcott | date=October 5, 2004}}</ref> 

According to the 2004 Senate Report on Prewar Intelligence, "The CIA provided four reports detailing the debriefings of [[Abu Zubaydah]], a captured senior coordinator for al-Qaida responsible for training and recruiting. Abu Zubaydah said that he was not aware of a relationship between Iraq and al-Qaida. He also said, however, that any relationship would be highly compartmented and went on to name al-Qaida members who he thought had good contacts with the Iraqis. For instance, Abu Zubaydah indicated that he had heard that an important al-Qaida associate, Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi, and others had good relationships with Iraqi Intelligence."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/congress/2004_rpt/iraq-wmd-intell_chapter12-l.htm | title=Detainee Debriefings - Comments on the Relationship}}</ref>

A classified memo obtained by [[Stephen F. Hayes]], prepared by [[Undersecretary of Defense for Policy]] [[Douglas J. Feith]] in response to questions posed by the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]] as part of its investigation into prewar intelligence, stated the following regarding al-Zarqawi:
{{cquote|Sensitive reporting indicates senior terrorist planner and close al Qaeda associate al Zarqawi has had an operational alliance with Iraqi officials. As of October 2002, al Zarqawi maintained contacts with the IIS to procure weapons and explosives, including surface-to-air missiles from an IIS officer in Baghdad. According to sensitive reporting, al Zarqawi was setting up sleeper cells in Baghdad to be activated in case of a U.S. occupation of the city, suggesting his operational cooperation with the Iraqis may have deepened in recent months. Such cooperation could include IIS provision of a secure operating bases [sic] and steady access to arms and explosives in preparation for a possible U.S. invasion. Al Zarqawi's procurements from the Iraqis also could support al Qaeda operations against the U.S. or its allies elsewhere.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/378fmxyz.asp?pg=1 | title=Case Closed | publisher=The Weekly Standard | author=Stephen F. Hayes | date=11/24/2003}}</ref>}}
The memo was a collection of raw intelligence reports and drew no conclusions.  U.S. intelligence officials conveyed to [[Newsweek]] that the "reports [in the memo] were old, uncorroborated and came from sources of unknown if not dubious credibility."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3540586/ | title=Case Decidedly Not Closed | publisher=Newsweek | author=Michael Isikoff and Mark Hosenball | date=November 19, 2003}}</ref>   
 
The 2006 Senate Report on Prewar Intelligence concluded that Zarqawi was not a link between Saddam and al-Qaeda:  "Postwar information indicates that Saddam Hussein attempted, unsuccessfully, to locate and capture al-Zarqawi and that the regime did not have a relationship with, harbor, or turn a blind eye toward Zarqawi."  The report also cited the debriefing of a "high-ranking Iraqi official" by the FBI. The official stated that a foreign government requested in October 2002 that the IIS locate five individuals suspected of involvement in the murder of Laurence Foley, which lead to the arrest of Abu Yasim Sayyem in early 2003.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.avot.org/article/20060918070400.html | title=Saddam Hussein<U+2019>s Support for Terror<U+2014>regardless of the Senate Intel. Cmte. Report}}</ref> The official told the FBI that evidence of Sayyem's ties to Zarqawi was compelling, and thus, he was "shocked" when Sayemm was ordered released by Saddam.  The official stated it "was ludicrous to think that the IIS had any involvement with al-Qaeda or Zarqawi," and suggested Saddam let Sayyem go because he "would participate in striking U.S. forces when they entered Iraq." In 2005, according to the Senate report, the CIA amended its 2004 report to conclude that "the regime did not have a relationship, harbor, or turn a blind eye toward Zarqawi and his associates."[http://intelligence.senate.gov/phaseiiaccuracy.pdf page 91<U+2013>92]  An intelligence official familiar with the CIA assessment also told Michael Isikoff of ''Newsweek'' magazine that the current draft of the report says that while Zarqawi did likely receive medical treatment in Baghdad in 2002, the report concludes that "most evidence suggests Saddam Hussein did not provide Zarqawi safe haven before the war,...[but] it also recognizes that there are still unanswered questions and gaps in knowledge about the relationship."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9831216/wid/6448213/site/newsweek | title=Fabricated Links? | publisher=Newsweek | author=Michael Isikoff and Mark Hosenball | date=October 26, 2005}}</ref>

The Army's Foreign Military Studies Office website translated a letter dated [[August 17]], [[2002]] from an Iraqi intelligence official.  The letter is part of the [[Operation Iraqi Freedom documents]].  The letter asks agents in the country to be on the lookout for Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and another unnamed man.  Pictures of both men were attached.

The letter issued the following 3 directives:
# Instructing your sources to continue their surveillance of the above mentioned individuals in your area of operations and inform us once you initiate such action. 
# Coordinate with Directorate 18 to verify the photographs of the above mentioned with photos of the members of the Jordanian community within your area of operations. 
# Conduct a comprehensive survey of all tourist facilities (hotels, furnished apartments, and leased homes). Give this matter your utmost attention. Keep us informed.

The documents also contain responses to this request.  One response, dated August 2002, states "Upon verifying the information through our sources and friends in the field as well as office (3), we found no information to confirm the presence of the above mentioned in our area of operation. Please review, we suggest circulating the contents of this message."  Another response, also dated [[August 2002]], states "After closely examining the data and through our sources and friends in (SATTS: U R A) square, and in Al-Qa'im immigration office, and in Office (3), none of the mentioned individuals are documented to be present in our area of jurisdiction."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://70.168.46.200/Released/07-13-06/ISGZ-2004-019920-HT-DHM2A.pdf | title=Operation Iraqi Freedom document (PDF)}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://70.168.46.200/Released/07-11-06/ISGZ-2004-019920.pdf | title=Operation Iraqi Freedom document (PDF)}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://70.168.46.200/released/04-24-06/ISGZ-2004-019920.pdf | title=Operation Iraqi Freedom document (PDF)}}</ref>  

According to ''[[ABC news]]'', "The letter seems to be coming from or going to Trebil, a town on the Iraqi-Jordanian border. Follow up on the presence of those subjects is ordered, as well as a comparison of their pictures with those of Jordanian subjects living in Iraq.

In his book ''At the Center of the Storm'', George Tenet writes:
:"...by the spring and summer of 2002, more than a dozen al-Qa'ida-affiliated extremists converged on Baghdad, with apparently no harassment on the part of the Iraqi government.  They found a comfortable and secure envirnonment in which they moved people and supplies to support Zarqawi's operations in northern Iraq."<ref name = "Tenet_p351"/> 
According to Tenet, while Zarqawi did find a safe haven in Iraq and did supervise camps in northeastern Iraq run by [[Ansar al-Islam]], "the intelligence did not show any Iraqi authority, direction, or control over any of the many specific terrorist acts carried out by al-Qa'ida."<ref>{{cite news | title=At the Center of the Storm: My years at the CIA | publisher=HarperCollins | author=George Tenet | page=341}}</ref>

== Arguments downplaying Zarqawi's importance ==

Some people have claimed that Zarqawi's notoriety was the product of U.S. war [[propaganda]] designed to promote the image of a [[demon]]ic enemy figure to help justify continued U.S. military operations in Iraq,<ref name="comw">{{cite web | year=2004| title=The al-Zarqawi Assessment: Another Instance of 'Cooked' Intelligence? | format=HTML | work=The Commonwealth Institute | url=http://www.comw.org/pda/0410zarqawi.html | accessdate=2006-06-09}}</ref>  perhaps with the tacit support of jihadi elements who wished to use him as a propaganda tool or as a distraction.<ref name="exile">{{cite web | author=Brecher, Gary| year=2005| title=Mister Big Unplugged #215 | format=HTML|work=eXile|url=http://www.exile.ru/2005-June-03/war_nerd.html|accessdate=2006-06-09}}</ref> In one report, the [[Conservatism|conservative]] newspaper ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' described the claim that Zarqawi was the head of the "terrorist network" in Iraq as a "[[mythology|myth]]".  This report cited an unnamed U.S. military intelligence source to the effect that the Zarqawi leadership myth was initially caused by faulty intelligence, but was later accepted because it suited U.S. government political goals.<ref>{{cite news |first=Adrian|last=Blomfield|title= How US fuelled myth of Zarqawi the mastermind|date=[[April 10]] [[2006]]|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/10/04/wirq04.xml }}</ref> One Sunni insurgent leader claimed on [[11 December]] that "Zarqawi is an [[American (USA)|American]], [[Israeli]] and [[Iran]]ian agent who is trying to keep our country unstable so that the Sunnis will keep facing occupation."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/06/09/db0901.xml| title=Abu Musab al-Zarqawi| date=09/06/2006| publisher=Telegraph| accessdate=2006-06-20}}</ref>

On [[February 18]] [[2006]], [[Shiite]] cleric [[Muqtada al-Sadr]] made similar charges:
{{cquote|I believe he is fictitious. He is a knife or a pistol in the hands of the occupier. I believe that all three - the occupation, the [[takfir]] (i.e. the practice of declaring other [[Muslims]] to be heretics) supporters, and the Saddam supporters - stem from the same source, because the [[takfir]] supporters and the Saddam supporters are a weapon in the hands of America and it pins it's crimes on them.<ref name="memri">[http://memri.org/bin/latestnews.cgi?ID=SD110006 memri.org SD110006] - this article no longer exists</ref>}}

On [[April 10]] [[2006]], the ''Washington Post'' reported that the U.S. military conducted a major propaganda offensive designed to exaggerate Zarqawi's role in the Iraqi insurgency.<ref name="zarqawi propaganda">{{cite news |first=Thomas | last=Ricks | title=Military Plays Up Role of Zarqawi|date=[[April 9]] [[2006]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post]] | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/09/AR2006040900890.html }}</ref>  Gen. [[Mark Kimmitt]] says of the propaganda campaign that there "was no attempt to manipulate the press."  In an internal briefing, Kimmitt is quoted as stating, "The Zarqawi PSYOP Program is the most successful information campaign to date."  The main goal of the propaganda campaign seems to have been to exacerbate a rift between insurgent forces in Iraq, but intelligence experts worried that it had actually enhanced Zarqawi's influence.<ref name="zarqawi propaganda">{{cite news |first=Thomas | last=Ricks | title=Military Plays Up Role of Zarqawi|date=[[April 9]] [[2006]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/09/AR2006040900890.html }}</ref>  Col. Derek Harvey, who served as a military intelligence officer in Iraq and then was one of the top officers handling Iraq intelligence issues on the staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned an Army meeting in 2004 that "Our own focus on Zarqawi has enlarged his caricature, if you will &mdash; made him more important than he really is, in some ways."<ref name="zarqawi propaganda">{{cite news |first=Thomas|last=Ricks|title=Military Plays Up Role of Zarqawi|date=[[April 9]] [[2006]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/09/AR2006040900890.html }}</ref>  While Pentagon spokespersons state unequivocally that PSYOPs may not be used to influence American citizens, there is little question that the information disseminated through the program has found its way into American media sources.  The ''Washington Post'' also notes that "One briefing slide about U.S. "strategic communications" in Iraq, prepared for Army Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the top U.S. commander in Iraq, describes the "home audience" as one of six major targets of the American side of the war."<ref name="zarqawi propaganda">{{cite news |first=Thomas|last=Ricks|title=Military Plays Up Role of Zarqawi|date=[[April 9]] [[2006]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post]] | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/09/AR2006040900890.html }}</ref>

On [[July 4]] [[2006]], the US Ambassador to Baghdad [[Zalmay Khalilzad]], in an interview with the ''[[BBC]]'', said that "in terms of the level of violence, it (the death of al-Zarqawi) has not had any impact at this point" and that  "...the level of violence is still quite high."  But Khalilzad maintained his view that the killing had though encouraged some insurgent groups to "reach out" and join government reconcialiation talks, he believed that previously these groups were intimidated by Zarqawi's presence.<ref>{{cite news|title=Zarqawi death has 'little impact'| date=[[July 4]] [[2006]]|publisher=[[BBC]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/5144520.stm }}</ref>

On 8th of June 2006, on the BBC's [[Question Time]], the [[Respect Party]] MP [[George Galloway]] referred to Zarqawi as 'a Boogeyman, built up by the Americans to try and perpetrate the lie that the resistance in Iraq are by foreigners, and that the mass of the Iraqi's are with the American and British occupation'.

On August 21, 2006, [[Jill Carroll]], a journalist for the [[Christian Science Monitor]], published part 6 of her story detailing her capitivity in Iraq. In it, she describes how one of her captors, who identified himself as Abdullah Rashid and leader of the Mujahideen Shura Council in Iraq, conveyed to her that "The Americans were constantly saying that the mujahideen in Iraq were led by foreigners...So, the Iraqi insurgents went to Zarqawi and insisted that an Iraqi be put in charge." She continued by stating: "But as I saw in coming weeks, Zarqawi remained the insurgents' hero, and the most influential member of their council, whatever Nour/Rashid's position. And it seemed to me, based on snatches of conversations, that two cell leaders under him - Abu Rasha and Abu Ahmed - might also be on the council. At various times, I heard my captors discussing changes in their plans because of directives from the council and Zarqawi."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0821/p01s01d-woiq.html | title=Part 6 <U+2022> Reciting Koranic verses | publisher=Christian Science Monitor | author=Jill Carroll | date=August 21, 2006}}</ref>

==Pre-war opportunities to kill Zarqawi==

According to ''[[NBC News]]'', [[the Pentagon]] had pushed to "take out" Zarqawi's operation at least three times prior to the [[Iraq war|invasion of Iraq]], but had been vetoed by the [[National Security Council]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Avoiding attacking suspected terrorist mastermind|date=[[March 2]] [[2004]]|publisher=[[NBC News]]|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4431601/ }}</ref> The council reportedly made its decision in an effort to convince other countries to join the US in a coalition against Iraq. "People were more obsessed with developing the coalition to overthrow Saddam than to execute the president<U+2019>s policy of pre-emption against terrorists," said former National Security Council member Roger Cressey.<ref>{{cite news|author =Jim Miklaszewski|title = Avoiding attacking suspected terrorist mastermind: Abu Musab Zarqawi blamed for more than 700 killings in Iraq|url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4431601/|publisher = [[MSNBC]] | date = March 2, 2004 |}}</ref>

In [[May 2006]], former CIA official [[Michael Scheuer]], who headed the CIA's bin Laden unit for six years before resigning in 2004, corroborated this. Paraphrasing his remarks, the ''[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'' stated Scheuer claimed that "the United States deliberately turned down several opportunities to kill terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in the lead-up to the Iraq war."  ABC added that "a plan to destroy Zarqawi's training camp in Kurdistan was abandoned for diplomatic reasons."  Scheuer explained that "the reasons the intelligence service got for not shooting Zarqawi was simply that the President and the National Security Council decided it was more important not to give the Europeans the impression we were gunslingers" in an effort to win support for ousting [[Saddam Hussein]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Bush turned down chances to kill Zarqawi: Ex-CIA spy|date=[[May 1]] [[2006]]|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)]] | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200605/s1627197.htm 
}}</ref> 

This claim was also corroborated by CENTCOM's Deputy Commander, Lt. General Michael DeLong, in an interview with ''[[PBS]]'' on [[February 14]] [[2006]]. DeLong, however, claims that the reasons for abandoning the opportunity to take out Zarqawi's camp was that the Pentagon feared that an attack would contaminate the area with [[chemical weapon]] materials: "We almost took them out three months before the Iraq war started. We almost took that thing, but we were so concerned that the chemical cloud from there could devastate the region that we chose to take them by land rather than by smart weapons."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/darkside/interviews/delong.html | title=Interview with Lt.

==Reports of Zarqawi's death, detention and injuries==
===Missing leg===
Claims of harm to Zarqawi have changed over time. Early in 2002, there were unverified reports from [[Afghan Northern Alliance]] members that Zarqawi had been killed by a missile attack in Afghanistan. Many news sources repeated the claim. Later, Kurdish groups claimed that Zarqawi had not died in the missile strike, but had been severely injured, and went to [[Baghdad]] in 2002 to have his leg amputated.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/06/15/bush.alqaeda/| year=June 15, 2004| title=Bush stands by al Qaeda, Saddam link|first= Various| last=Reporters| accessdate=2006-06-20| publisher=CNN}}</ref> On [[October 7]] [[2002]], the day before [[United States Congress|Congress]] voted to give President Bush authorization to invade Iraq, Bush gave a speech in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], that repeated as fact the claim that he had sought medical treatment in Baghdad.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/10/20021007-8.html| year=October 7, 2002| title=President Bush Outlines Iraqi Threat|first= George W.| last=Bush| accessdate=2006-06-20| publisher=Whitehouse.gov}}</ref> This was one of several of President Bush's primary examples of ways Saddam Hussein had aided, funded, and harbored al-Qaeda.

When the video of the Berg beheading was released in 2004, credence was given to the claim that Zarqawi was alive and active. The man identified as Zarqawi in the video did not appear to have a prosthetic leg. Videos of Zarqawi aired in 2006 that clearly showed him with both legs intact. When Zarqawi's body was autopsied, "X-rays also showed a fracture of his right lower leg."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,100880,00.html| year=June 13, 2006| title=Autopsy: Bomb Killed Al-Zarqawi|first= Various| last=Reporters| accessdate=2006-06-20| publisher=Associated Press}}</ref>

In [[March 2004]], an insurgent group in Iraq issued a statement saying that Zarqawi had been killed in [[April 2003]]. The statement said that he was unable to escape the missile attack because of his prosthetic leg. His followers claimed he was killed in a US bombing raid in the north of Iraq.<ref name="msnbc6">{{cite news|title=Iraq militants claim al-Zarqawi is dead|date=[[March 4]], [[2004]]|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4446084/ }}</ref>  The claim that Zarqawi had been killed in northern Iraq "at the beginning of the war," and that subsequent use of his name was a useful myth, was repeated in September 2005 by Sheikh Jawad Al-Khalessi, a Shiite [[imam]].<ref name="lemonde">{{cite news|title=Abou Moussab Al-Zarkaoui est mort.

He was also said to have subsequently left Iraq for a neighbouring country, accompanied by two physicians. However, later that week the radical Islamic website retracted its report about his injuries and claimed that he was in fine health and was running the jihad operation.

In a [[September 16]] [[2005]] article published by ''[[Le Monde]]'', Sheikh Jawad Al-Kalesi claimed that al-Zarqawi was killed in the Kurdish northern region of Iraq at the beginning of the US-led war on the country as he was meeting with members of the [[Ansar al-Islam]] group affiliated to al-Qaeda. Al-Kalesi also claimed "His family in Jordan even held a ceremony after his death." He also claimed that "Zarqawi has been used as a ploy by the United States, as an excuse to continue the occupation" and saying, "It was a pretext so they don't leave Iraq."<ref name="aljazeera2">{{cite news|title=Cleric says al-Zarqawi died long ago|date= [[September 17]], [[2005]]|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] | url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/73570F02-EA07-492F-9E04-C080950DF180.htm }}</ref>

On [[November 20]] [[2005]], some news sources reported that Zarqawi may have been killed in a coalition assault on a house in [[Mosul]]; five of those in the house were killed in the assault while the other three died through using '[[suicide belt]]s' of explosives.

== Zarqawi's death ==
[[Image:Zarqawi safe house rubble, June 8 2006.jpg|thumb|300px|Remains of Zarqawi's safe house, [[June 8]], [[2006]].]]
Zarqawi was killed on [[June 7]] [[2006]], while attending a meeting in an isolated [[safehouse]] approximately 8 [[kilometer|km]] (5 [[mile|mi]]) north of [[Baqubah]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Iraq Terror Chief Killed In Airstrike | date=[[June 8]] [[2006]]|publisher=CBS News|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/06/08/iraq/main1692753.shtml }}</ref> At 14:15 GMT two [[United States Air Force]] [[F-16]]C jets<ref>{{cite news|title= Tucson Raytheon had role in al-Zarqawi death|date=[[June 9]] [[2006]]|publisher=Arizona Daily Star|url=http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/attack/132868 }}</ref> identified the house and the lead jet dropped two 500-pound (230kg) guided bombs, a laser-guided [[GBU-12]] and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]-guided [[GBU-38]] on the building located at {{coor dms|33|48|02.83|N|44|30|48.58|E}}.

The joint task force had been tracking him for some time, and although there were some close calls, he had eluded them on many occasions.

Initially, the U.S. military reported that Zarqawi was killed directly in the attack. However, according to a statement made the following day by Major General William Caldwell of the U.S. Army, Zarqawi survived for a short time after the bombing, and after being placed on a stretcher, attempted to move and was restrained, after which he died from his injuries.<ref>{{cite news | title= Zarqawi 'alive when found' | date=[[June 9]] [[2006]] | publisher=The Guardian | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,,1794019,00.html }}</ref> An Iraqi man, who claims to have arrived on the scene a few moments after the attack, said he saw U.S. troops beating up the badly-wounded but still alive Zarqawi.<ref>{{cite news | title= Was Al-Zarqawi Beaten After Bombing? | publisher=CBS News | date=[[June 10]] [[2006]] | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/06/10/iraq/main1699100.shtml}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Michael|last=Smith|title=How Iraq's ghost of death was cornered|date=[[June 11]] [[2006]]|publisher=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-2220222_1,00.html }}</ref> In contradiction, Caldwell asserted that when U.S. troops found Zarqawi barely alive they tried to provide him with medical help, rejecting the allegations that he was beaten based on an autopsy performed.

The U.S. government distributed an image of Zarqawi's corpse as part of the press pack associated with the press conference. The release of the image has been criticised for being in questionable taste, and for inadvertently creating an iconic image of Zarqawi that would be used to rally his supporters.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2006/06/08/publiceye/entry1696443.shtml| publisher=CBS News| date=12 June 2006| title=There Are Two Sides To Some Of The Stories That Pictures Can Tell| accessdate=2006-06-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/08/AR2006060801890.html| publisher=Washington Post| date=9 June 2006| title=A Chilling Portrait, Unsuitably Framed| accessdate=2006-06-20}}</ref>

Prime Minister of Iraq [[Nuri al-Maliki]] commented on the death of Zarqawi by saying: "Today, Zarqawi has been terminated. Every time a Zarqawi appears we will kill him. We will continue confronting whoever follows his path. It is an open war between us."<ref name= cnn0608>{{cite news|title= World reacts to al-Zarqawi death| date=[[June 8]] [[2006]]| publisher=CNN | url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/06/08/zarqawi.reax/index.html }}</ref>

United States President George W. Bush stated that through his every action al-Zarqawi sought to defeat America and its coalition partners by turning Iraq into a safe haven for al-Qaeda. Bush also stated, "Now Zarqawi has met his end and this violent man will never murder again."<ref name= cnn0608 />

Zarqawi's brother-in-law has since claimed that he was a [[martyr]] even though the family renounced Zarqawi and his actions in the aftermath of the [[2005 Amman bombings|Amman triple suicide bombing]] that killed at least 60 people.<ref name=ap0608>{{cite news|title=Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi Killed in Air Raid| date=[[June 8]] [[2006]]|publisher=AP News|url=http://apnews.myway.com/article/20060608/D8I41K780.html }}</ref> The opinion of Iraqis on his death is mixed; some believe that it will promote peace between the warring factions, while others are convinced that his death will provoke his followers to a massive [[revenge|retaliation]] and cause more bombings and deaths in Iraq.<ref name="Zarqawi killed">{{cite news|title= Abu Musab al-Zarqawi killed in air raid |publisher= Associated Press|date= [[June 8]] [[2006]]

Abu Abdulrahman al-Iraqi, the deputy of al-Zarqawi (which may be the individual called "Sheik Abd-Al-Rahman" mentioned above, meaning he was not present as the bombing happened), released a statement to [[Islamist]] websites indicating that al-Qaeda in Iraq also confirmed Zarqawi's death: "We herald the martyrdom of our [[mujahideen|mujahed]] Sheikh Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in Iraq <U+2026> and we stress that this is an honor to our nation."<ref>{{cite news|title=Qaeda in Iraq confirms Zarqawi's death - Web site|publisher=Reuters|date=[[June 8]] [[2006]] | url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L08233828.htm}}</ref> In the statement, al-Iraqi vowed to continue the jihad in Iraq.

On [[June 16]] [[2006]], Abu Abdullah Rashid al-Baghdadi, the head of the [[Mujahideen Shura Council]], which groups five [[Iraqi insurgency|Iraqi insurgent]] organizations including [[al-Qaida in Iraq]], released an audio tape statement in which he described the death of al-Zarqawi as a "great loss." He continued by stating that al-Zarqawi "will remain a symbol for all the mujahideen, who will take strength from his steadfastness." Al-Baghdadi is believed to be a former officer in Saddam's army, or its elite [[Iraqi Republican Guard|Republican Guard]], who has worked closely with al-Zarqawi since the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|overthrow of Saddam's regime]] in April 2003.<ref>{{cite news|title=New tape says Zarqawi death 'great loss'|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=[[June 16]] [[2006]] | url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060617/ap_on_re_mi_ea/iraq_insurgent_tape_7}}</ref>

Counterterrorism officials have said that al-Zarqawi had become a key part of al-Qaeda's marketing campaign and that al-Zarqawi served as a "worldwide jihadist rallying point and a fundraising icon." Rep. [[Mike J. Rogers]], R-Mich., who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, called al-Zarqawi "The terrorist celeb, if you will, ... It is like selling for any organization. They are selling the success of Zarqawi in eluding capture in Iraq."<ref>{{cite news|title=Al-Qaida likely to alter marketing efforts|date=[[June 9]] [[2006]]|publisher= [[Associated Press]] | url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2006/06/09/al_qaida_likely_to_alter_marketing_efforts/ }}</ref>

On [[June 23]] [[2006]], Al-Jazeera aired a video in which [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], considered al-Qaeda's No. 2 leader, states that Zarqawi was "a soldier, a hero, an [[imam]] and the prince of martyrs, [and his death] has defined the struggle between the crusaders and Islam in Iraq."<ref>{{cite news|title=Al-Qaeda No. 2 mentions al-Zarqawi's death|date=[[June 24]] [[2006]]|publisher=[[Associated Press]] | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-06-23-zarqawi_x.htm?csp=34 }}</ref>

On [[June 30]] [[2006]], Osama bin Laden released an audio recording in which he stated, "Our Islamic nation was surprised to find its knight, the lion of jihad, the man of determination and will, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, killed in a shameful American raid. We pray to God to bless him and accept him among the martyrs as he had hoped for." Bin Laden also defended al-Zarqawi, saying he had "clear instructions" to focus on U.S.-led forces in Iraq but also "for those who ... stood to fight on the side of the crusaders against the Muslims, then he should kill them whoever they are, regardless of their sect or tribe." Shortly after, he released another audio tape in which he stated, "Our brothers, the mujahedeen in the al-Qaeda organization, have chosen the dear brother [[Abu Hamza al-Muhajer]] as their leader to succeed the Amir Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. I advise him to focus his fighting on the Americans and everyone who supports them and allies himself with them in their war on the people of Islam and Iraq."<ref>{{cite news | title=Tape: Bin Laden tells Sunnis to fight Shiites in Iraq | date=[[July 1]] [[2006]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/01/binladen.message/index.html?section=cnn_latest }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Bin Laden recording praises al-Zarqawi|date=[[June 30]] [[2006]]|publisher=itv.com|url=http://www.itv.com/news/439ac3b5af99ab7fb431c746e82e02b1.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Bin Laden lauds al-Zarqawi; readies message|date=[[June 30]] [[2006]] | publisher=Associated Press | url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060701/ap_on_re_mi_ea/bin_laden_tape_14 }}</ref>

===Alleged betrayal by al-Qaeda===
A day before Zarqawi was killed, a U.S. strategic analysis site<ref>{{cite news | title=Zarqawi Scheduled for Martyrdom| publisher=StrategyPage| date=[[June 8]], [[2006]]|url=http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htmurph/articles/20060607.aspx}}</ref> suggested that Zarqawi could have lost the trust of al-Qaeda due to his emphatic anti-[[Shia]] stance and the massacres of civilians allegedly committed in his name. Reports in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on [[June 9]] treated the betrayal by at least one fellow al-Qaeda member as fact, stating that an individual close to Zarqawi disclosed the identity and location of Sheik Abd al-Rahman to Jordanian and American intelligence. Non-stop surveillance of Abd al-Rahman quickly led to Zarqawi.

The ''[[Associated Press]]'' quotes an unnamed Jordanian official as saying that the effort to find Zarqawi was successful partly due to information that Jordan obtained one month beforehand from a captured Zarqawi al-Qaeda operative named [[Ziad Khalaf Raja al-Karbouly]].<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. Moves to Stop Zarqawi Network in Iraq|publisher=Associated Press| date=[[June 9]] [[2006]] | url=http://www.comcast.net/news/index.jsp?cat=GENERAL&fn=/2006/06/09/410184.html&cvqh=itn_zarqawi}}</ref>

===Reward===
In apparent contradiction to statements made earlier in the day by U.S. ambassador to Iraq [[Zalmay Khalilzad]], an Iraqi spokesman said the US$25 million reward "will be honored" (although this need not mean that any money will actually be paid, as the terms of the reward would indeed be "honored" by having no payee if no one qualifies).<ref>{{cite news|title=Reward for al-Zarqawi will be honored|publisher=Associated Press|date=[[June 8]] [[2006]]|url=http://www.kare11.com/news/national/national_article.aspx?storyid=126720}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=US: nobody yet identified for big Zarqawi bounty|publisher=Reuters|date=[[June 8]] [[2006]]|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060608/ts_nm/iraq_zarqawi_bounty_dc_1}}</ref> Khalilzad, in an interview with CNN's [[Wolf Blitzer]], had stated the bounty would not be paid because the decisive information leading to Zarqawi's whereabouts had been supplied by an al-Qaeda in Iraq operative whose own complicity in violent acts would disqualify him from receiving payment.

Rep. [[Mark Kirk]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] of Illinois who wrote the legislation specifying the Zarqawi reward, has been quoted as saying that the Bush Administration does plan to pay "some rewards" for Zarqawi. "I don't have the specifics," he said, "The administration is now working out who will get it and how much. As their appropriator who funds them, I asked them to let me know if they need more money to run the rewards program now that they are paying this out."<ref>{{cite news|first=Eli|last=Lake|pages=2|title=Forces Asked That Price on Zarqawi's Head Be Reduced|date=[[June 14]] [[2006]] | publisher=[http://www.nysun.com The New York Sun] | url=http://www.nysun.com/article/34443 }}</ref>

===Post-Zarqawi Iraq environment===

[[Image:Al-masri.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Abu Hamza al-Muhajer]], successor to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, [[June 11]], [[2006]].]]
Zarqawi's death was seen a major coup for the US government in terms of the political and propaganda stakes. However, unconfirmed rumors in early April 2006 suggested that Zarqawi had been demoted from a strategic or coordinating function to overseer of paramilitary/terrorist activities of his group and that [[Abdullah bin Rashed al-Baghdadi]] of the [[Mujahideen Shura Council]] succeeded Zarqawi in the former function. On [[June 15]] [[2006]], the United States military officially identified [[Abu Ayyub al-Masri]] as the successor to Al-Qaeda in Iraq.<ref name = "CNN_chief"/>

Since Zarqawi's demise in early June 2006 there has been little or no identifiable change in terms of the level of violence and attacks against U.S. and allied troops. In the immediate aftermath insurgency attacks averaged 90 a day, apparently some of the highest on record.<ref> {{ cite news | title=Death of Zarqawi is a mere sideshow | first=Fraser | last = Nelson| publisher=[[Scotland on Sunday]] | url=http://news.scotsman.com/columnists.cfm?id=860432006| date=[[June 11]] [[2006]] }} </ref> Four months after Zarqawi's death, it is estimated that 374 coalition soldiers and 10355 Iraqis have been killed.<ref> {{cite web | title = Iraq Coalition Casualty Count | publisher = icasualties.org|url = http://icasualties.org/oif|accessdate = 2006-11-12}} </ref> Several insurgency groups and heads of Sunni Muslim tribes have also formed a coalition led by the Mujahideen Shura Council.<ref> {{cite news|title = Iraq Qaeda-led group forms coalition|publisher = Scotsman.com|url = http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=1513392006|date = [[October 12]] [[2006]] | accessdate = 2006-10-28}} </ref>
