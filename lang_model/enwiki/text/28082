==''American Idol''==
Lambert auditioned for the [[American Idol (season 8)|eighth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]'' in [[San Francisco, California]]. In  a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview he said his decision to audition for the show came after a week at [[Burning Man]] where he experimented with "[[magic mushrooms|certain funguses]]." He went on to say that "I had a psychedelic experience where I looked up at the clouds and went, 'Oh!' I realized that we all have our own power, and that whatever I wanted to do, I had to make happen."<ref>{{cite news|author=By<U+00A0> Alan Duke CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/06/09/adam.lambert.gay/index.html?iref=mpstoryview |title=Adam Lambert: I'm 'proud of my sexuality' |publisher=CNN.com |date=2009-06-09 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref> 

During his initial audition, he sang "[[Rock with You (Michael Jackson song)|Rock With You]]" and "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]." Lambert had cited several musical influences, including [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[David Bowie]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Aerosmith]], and [[Led Zeppelin]].<ref name="AMG"> [http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:jcfqxzqgldse Adam Lambert Biography] Allmusic.com</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanidol.com/contestants/season_8/adam_lambert/ |title=Adam Lambert <U+2013> Season 8 Contestants |publisher=American Idol |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref>
In the semifinals, Lambert was voted into the Top 13, joining fellow Group 2 performers [[Allison Iraheta]] and [[Kris Allen]]. Lambert and Allen became roommates in the Idol mansion, with Allen stating it was due to their neatness.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://dannygokeyfansite.com/2009/03/21/more-american-idol-mansion-peek-us-weekly-issue/ |title=Idols move into the Idol Mansion.|accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>

During [[Michael Jackson]] week, he sang "[[Black or White]]" leading to praise from all four judges, with [[Paula Abdul]] predicting that he would go on to the finals.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://mjsbigblog.com/american-idol-season-8-top-13-performance-video.htm |title=MJs Top 13 Performances Recap & Review.|accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref> The following week, Lambert sang a version of "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]". While [[Randy Jackson]], [[Kara DioGuardi]], and Abdul all liked his performance, [[Simon Cowell]] called it "indulgent rubbish".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psychoticstate.blogspot.com/2009/03/american-idol-adam-is-in-ring-of-fire.html |title=Psychotic State: American Idol|accessdate=2009-03-17}}</ref> On [[Motown]] night, Lambert sang an acoustic version of [[The Miracles]]', "[[The Tracks of My Tears]]". The judges all liked it, and [[Smokey Robinson]], the week's mentor and the original singer-songwriter, gave Lambert a standing ovation. For his Top 8 performance, Lambert sang the 2001 [[Michael Andrews (musician)|Michael Andrews]] and [[Gary Jules]] arrangement of "[[Mad World (song)|Mad World]]". Because the show had exceeded its time slot, only Cowell gave a critique, which he did by simply giving Lambert a standing ovation. During the results next night, the other judges agreed that a standing ovation was the best critique of Lambert's performance.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.americanidol.com/contestants/season_8/adam_lambert/ |title= Performances and Reviews|accessdate=2009-03-29}}</ref> For his second Top 7 performance, Lambert sang "[[If I Can't Have You]]", delivering what DioGuardi described as his "most memorable performance", while Cowell described his vocals as "immaculate". Abdul was reduced to tears, with host [[Ryan Seacrest]] joking that Lambert had melted her into a "pool of Abdul".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://tvwatch.people.com/2009/04/22/idol-kris-allen-works-hard-to-stay-alive-on-disco-night/ |title=TV-Watch: Kris Allen "Works Hard" to "Stay Alive" on Disco Night.|accessdate=2009-04-22}}</ref> In the Top 4, Lambert was the first to sing, performing "[[Whole Lotta Love]]". Cowell commented, "that was one of my favorite performances...nobody can top that now", while Abdul, punning on the song's title, described Lambert's performance as "a whole lotta perfect".

Photos of Lambert romantically kissing another man surfaced while he was competing on ''American Idol''.  Initially shown and discussed by commentators on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', the panel agreed that the images would likely have no impact on the competition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/fashion/12gayidol.html?_r=1&ref=style|title=Gay Talk Surrounds Adam Lambert of 'Idol'. | work=The New York Times | first=Guy | last=Trebay | date=2009-04-12}}</ref> Lambert confirmed that the photos were of him, stating he had nothing to hide and has always been open about his life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Television/story?id=7336548&page=1|title=Adam Lambert: America's First gay 'Idol'?}}</ref> Mainstream media speculation centered on Lambert's sexuality; presuming he was [[gay]], he would be the first gay American Idol.<ref name="ewal"> [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20007164_20171835_20277643,00.html "Adam Lambert: Shaking Up 'Idol': He's the most exciting ''American Idol'' contestant in years: Huge voice, over-the-top theatrics...and that whole ''Is he gay?'' thing.

On May 20, 2009, Lambert was announced as the runner-up for the eighth season of ''American Idol''. Lambert performed a medley of "[[Beth (song)|Beth]]", "[[Detroit Rock City]]", and "[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]" with rock band [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] during the final episode. His version of the winning single "[[No Boundaries (song)|No Boundaries]]" was later released on [[iTunes]] alongside ''American Idol'' winner [[Kris Allen]]'s version. Before the results were announced, Allen and Lambert joined together with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]<U+2019>s original guitarist [[Brian May]] and drummer [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]] to perform the anthem "[[We Are the Champions]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dailycontributor.com/kris-and-adam-sing-we-are-the-champions/5058/ |title=American Idol Finale: Kris and Adam sing <U+2018>We Are the Champions<U+2019> (video) |publisher=Daily Contributor |date=2009-05-21 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref> 

Upon winning, Allen said "Adam deserved this." Explaining this remark, Allen said that he thought Lambert deserved to win as much as he did, and that Lambert "was the most consistent person all year.

I was broke at the time and this was my chance to make a few bucks, so I jumped at the opportunity to record for my first time in a professional studio. The work I did back then in no way reflects the music I am currently in the studio working on."<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/adam-lambert-pre-idol-debut-album-due-this-1003986264.story Billboard article: "Adam Lambert Pre-'Idol' Debut Album Due This Summer"]</ref> On November 17, Lambert's album was released with a new name: "''Take One''."

Tour 2009]] with his fellow Top 10 contestants; the tour visited 50 cities in the United States and Canada from July 5 to September 15, 2009.

In November, Lambert performed "[[For Your Entertainment (song)|For Your Entertainment]]" at the [[American Music Awards of 2009]]. The performance showed Lambert kissing a male keyboardist, grinding a dancer's head against his pelvis, and grabbing the crotch of another. Lambert told ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, "Female performers have been doing this for years<U+2014>pushing the envelope about sexuality<U+2014>and the minute a man does it, everybody freaks out. We're in 2009<U+2014>it's time to take risks, be a little more brave, time to open people's eyes and if it offends them, then maybe I'm not for them. My goal was not to piss people off, it was to promote freedom of expression and artistic freedom."<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1626851/20091123/lambert_adam_american_idol.jhtml |title=Adam Lambert Says AMA Kiss Was 'In The Moment'|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=23 November 2009|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=23 November 2009}}</ref> In response to his performance, the [[Parents Television Council]], a conservative [[decency]] campaigning group,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1039700,00.html |title=The Decency Police|author=Poniewozik, James|work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=2005-03-20|accessdate=2009-10-14}}</ref> urged viewers to complain to the FCC.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/390281-PTC_Upset_Over_Adam_Lambert_AMA_Performance.php |title=PTC Upset Over Adam Lambert AMA Performance| last=Eggerton|first=John|date=23 November 2009|work=Broadcasting & Cable|accessdate=23 November 2009}}</ref> The performance, at the end of the show, was broadcast "outside the FCC's usual 6am-10pm time frame prohibiting the broadcast of indecent material".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rockstarweekly.com/content/view/1202/149/|title=Adam Lambert Could Cost ABC Television Up To $500,000 |date=23 November 2009|work= Rockstar Weekly|accessdate=23 November 2009}}</ref> ABC received about 1,500 telephoned complaints and announced he would not perform on [[Good Morning America]] on November 25 as planned.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://new.music.yahoo.com/adam-lambert/news/abc-lamberts-performance-draws-1-500-complaints--61996642 |title=ABC: Lambert's performance draws 1,500 complaints|date=23 November 2009|work=Yahoo!
