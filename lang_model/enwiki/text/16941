The '''Vaal Triangle''' is a [[triangle|triangular]] area of land formed by [[Vereeniging]], [[Vanderbijlpark]] and [[Sasolburg]] - together they comprise a substantial urban complex in [[South Africa]]. [[Meyerton]], just north of Vereeniging, is also generally included in the complex. The area straddles the [[Vaal_River|Vaal River]] and is a major industrial region, which is home to [[Iron and Steel Corporation (ISCOR)]] and [[Sasol]], the [[steel]] and [[Petroleum|oil]]-from-[[coal]] processing facilities.

Due to the heavy industries in and around the Vaal Triangle it became infamous for its [[Air_Pollution|air pollution]] and [[Respiratory_disease|respiratory disease]].  For this reason, local [[Afrikaans]] speaking people often refer to the reagon as the ''Vuil Driehoek'' (meaning ''Dirty Triangle'') as a pun on ''Vaal Driehoek'' (the [[Afrikaans]] translation for Vaal Triangle).

Nearby is the [[Vaal_dam|Vaal Dam]], from which the massive PWV megalopolis ([[Pretoria]], [[Witwatersrand]] and [[Vereeniging]]) draws its water. The PWV forms the urban heart of [[Gauteng province]]. The Witwatersrand is the name given to the area that comprises the Greater Johannesburg metropole and the gold-bearing reef along which [[gold]] was discovered in [[1886]].

The Vaal Dam is well-patronised by people from Johannesburg over the weekends and during holidays, as it provides extensive water recreation facilities some 70 km south of the city.
