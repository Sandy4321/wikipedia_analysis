==Biography==
Ben Kuroki was born in [[Gothenburg, Nebraska]], [[United States]] to Japanese-American immigrants, Shosuke and Naka (n<U+00E9>e Yokoyama) Kuroki on May 16, 1917. They had 10 children. When he was a year old the Kuroki family relocated to [[Hershey, Nebraska|Hershey]], [[Nebraska]], where they owned and operated a farm.  The [[Lincoln County, Nebraska|Lincoln County]] town had a population of about 500.<ref>Yenne, Bill. (2007).

After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, Ben's father encouraged him as well as his brother Fred Kuroki to enlist in the [[U.S. Military]].  The brothers were rejected by the recruiters in [[Grand Island, Nebraska|Grand Island]], so they tried again at [[North Platte, Nebraska|North Platte]], where their enlistment was processed without any questions<U+2014>perhaps, as a humorous story suggests, the recruiters thought that Kuroki was a Polish name. Kuroki said this recruiter said nationality was not a problem as he made $2 for every recruit.<ref name="yenne138">Yenne, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ok3JZw28xhEC&pg=PA12&dq=issei&lr=&client=firefox-a&sig=ACfU3U2JXjxtiwBCtH0UYVFMwH-8lWGkFA#PPA138,M1  p. 138;] Sterner, Douglas C.

The two Kuroki brothers enlisted in the [[U.S. Army]], two of the very first [[Nisei]] to do so.   In January 1942, they were sent to basic training at Sheppard Field, Texas.<ref name="Kral"/>

==Military career==
Assigned to the 93rd Bombardment Group at [[Fort Myers, Florida]], he was told that Japanese-Americans would not be allowed to serve overseas. In 1942 Kuroki petitioned his commanding officer and was allowed to work as a clerk for the [[Eighth Air Force]] at a base in [[England]]. The need for aerial gunners was high and after Kuroki volunteered, he was sent to gunnery school for two weeks and became a [[top turret gunner]] on a [[B-24 Liberator]],<ref name="Frank">{{cite web |last=Frank |first=Abe |title=Ben Kuroki |work=Conscience and the Constitution |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service |year=2000 |url=http://www.pbs.org/itvs/conscience/the_story/characters/kuroki_ben.html |accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> the most widely produced American heavy bomber to be used by Allied forces in World War II.<ref name="yenne138"/>  Kuroki was in a B-24 that crash landed in [[Spanish Morocco]] and was captured by [[Spain|Spanish]] authorities. His crew was released by the Spanish after three months. After the [[U.S. Department of State]] secured his release, he returned to England and rejoined his squadron.

On August 1, 1943, he participated in the dangerous bombing mission known as [[Operation Tidal Wave|Operation ''Tidal Wave'']], an effort to destroy the major oil refinery located in [[Ploesti, Romania]].<ref name="yenne138"/>  Kuroki flew 30 combat missions in the European theater, when the regular enlistment only required 25. After a medical review, he was allowed to fly 5 more missions above the mandated enlistment. Kuroki said he did so for his brother Fred, who was still stationed stateside. On his 30th mission he was slightly injured when his gun turret was hit by [[anti-aircraft warfare|flak]].<ref name="Kral"/><ref name="Time">{{cite news |title=Ben Kuroki, American |publisher=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,791334,00.html |accessdate=2007-08-06 | date=1944-02-07}}</ref>

During rest and recovery back in the United States, Kuroki was directed by the Army to visit a number of [[Japanese American internment]] camps in order to encourage able-bodied males to enlist in the U.S. military. Kuroki was the subject of a number of news articles including one in [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine.

Kuroki requested but was denied the opportunity to participate in the [[Pacific]] theater. Only after the intervention of [[Henry Stimson]], the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] was that request granted.<ref>Yenne, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ok3JZw28xhEC&pg=PA12&dq=issei&lr=&client=firefox-a&sig=ACfU3U2JXjxtiwBCtH0UYVFMwH-8lWGkFA#PPA139,M1  pp. 139]-140.</ref>  Kuroki was later permitted to join the crew of a [[B-29 Superfortress]] (who named its plane ''Sad Saki'' after Kuroki) in the 484th Squadron, 505th Bombardment Group, 20th U.S. Army Air Force, based on [[Tinian Island]]. Kuroki then participated in another 28 bombing missions over mainland [[Japan]] and other locations.<ref>Yenne, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ok3JZw28xhEC&pg=PA12&dq=issei&lr=&client=firefox-a&sig=ACfU3U2JXjxtiwBCtH0UYVFMwH-8lWGkFA#PPA140,M1  p. 140.]</ref>

Kuroki is the only Japanese American known to have participated in air combat missions in the Pacific theater of operations during the war.<ref name="Kral"/> Kuroki was awarded one [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for his 25 missions in [[Europe]] and another for participation in the Ploesti raid.<ref name="Time"/> By the end of the war, he had been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross a total of three times as well as the [[Air Medal]] with five [[oak leaf cluster]]s.<ref name="Kral"/> By the end of the war, Ben Kuroki had completed 58 combat missions.

==Advocacy efforts==
Fiercely patriotic, but understanding first hand some of the racial and other inequalities minorities had to endure, Kuroki continued to speak about the need for racial equality and against prejudice. He engaged in a series of speaking tours discussing these issues, which he funded with his own savings and with minor donations, including proceeds from Ralph G. Martin's biography written about him entitled "''Boy From Nebraska: The Story of Ben Kuroki''".

When asked about his battle to overcome prejudice which almost prevented him from being allowed to participate in overseas aerial combat missions, Kuroki stated, "I had to fight like hell for the right to fight for my own country".<ref name="PBS"/>

==Post-military career==
Kuroki later attended the [[University of Nebraska]], attaining a [[Bachelor's degree]] in [[journalism]] in 1950. He was a reporter and editor for a number of newspapers in several different states, retiring in 1984.<ref name="Kral"/>  On August 12, 2005, Kuroki was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] for his impressive combat participation during the war and for overcoming numerous incidents of prejudice.  He was awarded an honorary [[Doctorate]] from the University of Nebraska on August 13, 2005 and is the subject of the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] documentary "''Most Honorable Son: Ben Kuroki's Amazing War Story''".<ref name="PBS">{{cite web |title=Nebraska WWII Hero Ben Kuroki to be Honored at Premiere of NET Television |publisher=NET Nebraska |date=2007-06-28 |url=http://www.netnebraska.org/about/pdfs/062807_01.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref><ref name="news">{{cite news |title=Proud to be Ben Kuroki's kind of people |publisher=Journal Star |date=2007-08-02 |url=http://journalstar.com/articles/2007/08/02/opinion/editorial/doc46b110f609c37837081769.txt |accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref>
