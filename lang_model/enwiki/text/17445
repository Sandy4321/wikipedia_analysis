'''Domhnall mac Raghnaill''' was a Hebridean chief from the late twelfth- and early thirteenth-century. He is the [[eponym]]ous progenitor of [[Clan Donald]] (''Clann Dh<U+00F2>mhnaill'', "Children of Donald"). For this reason some traditions accumulated around him in the [[Later Middle Ages]] and [[Early Modern period]]. Despite his role as the historical figurehead of one of the world's most famous kindreds and surnames, there is almost no contemporary evidence yielding certain information about his life.

His place in the genealogical tradition of the MacDonalds is the only reason for believing in his existence, a genealogical tradition that all historians have accepted. Beyond his actual existence, there is little that is certain. Three entries in Irish annals may discuss him, though he is never named; a praise poem surviving from the Early Modern period may be descended from a poem originally written for him; a miracle in a [[Isle of Man|Manx]] chronicle may or may not have Domhnall as its subject; and a doubtful [[charter]] surviving from a similarly late era was allegedly issued by him.

==Origins==
Domhnall was, reputedly, the son of [[Raghnall mac Somhairle|Raghnall]] (fl. 1192) son of [[Somerled|Somhairle]] (died 1164). The seventeenth-century ''History of the Macdonalds'' by Hugh MacDonald of Sleat claimed that Domhnall's father Raghnall had married a daughter or sister of the early fourteenth-century hero [[Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray]]. Sellar suggested that this tradition may have derived from a garbled version of reality. Perhaps, Sellar argued, his mother was a daughter of [[William fitz Duncan]]. The latter was another famous [[Mormaer of Moray|Earl of Moray]], but one who lived in the twelfth- rather than the fourteenth-century.<ref>Sellar, "Hebridean Sea-Kings", p. 200.</ref> 

In a charter to [[Paisley Abbey]] Domhnall's father Raghnall is given a wife named ''Fonia'' (Fionnghuala?),<ref>Sellar, "Hebridean Sea-Kings", p. 195; McLeod & Bateman, ''Duanaire na Sracaire'', p. 503 states, without citing evidence, that this woman was a grand-daughter of [[Fergus of Galloway|Fergus]], [[King of Galloway]].</ref> though there is no direct proof that this was the name of Domhnall's mother. Domhnall's father Raghnall, carrying the legacy of his own father Somhairle, was a powerful Argyll and Hebridean magnate who, depending on context, bore the titles "King of the Isles", "Lord of Argyll and Kintyre", and "lord of the Hebrides (''Inchegal'').<ref name=Sellarfigure>Sellar, "Hebridean Sea-Kings", p. 194, table ii.</ref> His father's legacy was such that he became the ancestor figure of both Clan Ruaidhri and [[Clan Donald]].<ref name=Sellarfigure/>

==Possible evidence of life==
===Annals of Ulster===
There are no certain contemporary notices of Domhnall, and Domhnall's existence is not explicitly attested in any reliable contemporary source datable to any particular year. However, in 1212, Domhnall may have been one of the "sons of Raghnall" who suffered some kind of military defeat at the hands of the men of the [[Isle of Skye]]. The ''Annals of Ulster'', reporting for the year 1209, recorded that:  <blockquote>A battle was fought by the sons of Raghnall, son of Somhairle, against the men of Skye, wherein slaughter was inflicted upon them.<ref>''[[Annals of Ulster]]'', [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G100001B/index.html s.a. 1209.2] ([http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100001B/text009.html trans.]).</ref></blockquote> A similar report from the same source has the "sons of Raghnaill" join in a raid on the Irish city of [[Derry]] led by Tom<U+00E1>s Mac Uchtraigh, brother of [[Alan, Lord of Galloway]]. Under the year 1212 it related that: <blockquote>Tom<U+00E1>s Mac Uchtraigh, with the sons of Raghnall, son of Somhairle, came to Derry of St. [[Columba|Colum-Cille]] with six and seventy ships and the town was greatly destroyed by them and [[Inishowen|Inis-Eogain]] was completely destroyed by them and by the [[Cen<U+00E9>l Conaill]].<ref>[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G100001B/text003.html s.a. 1212.4] ([http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100001B/text012.html trans]).</ref></blockquote> Two years later, a similar raid by Tom<U+00E1>s is mentioned by the same source, though the only "son of Raghnall" reported as present that time was Domhnall's older brother, [[Ruaidhri mac Raghnaill]].<ref>''Annals of Ulster'', [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G100001B/text003.html s.a. 1214.2] ([http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100001B/text014.html trans]).</ref>

===''Domhnall mac Raghnaill, Rosg Mall''===
A recently rediscovered poem <U+2014> though from a seventeenth century manuscript written by Niall MacMhuirich <U+2014> was addressed to one ''Domhnall mac Raghnaill, Rosg Mall'' ("Domhnall mac Raghnaill, of the Stately Gaze"). It is possible that this may refer to the same Domhnall mac Raghnaill, a claim made by its recent editor.<ref>McLeod & Bateman, ''Duanaire na Sracaire'', p. 75.</ref> The poem gives little information. Besides associating him with [[Lennox]], a quatrain addressed him as: <blockquote>
{| 
| ''<U+00D3> Ghothfruigh <U+00F3> h<U+00C1>mhlaibh Fhinn,&nbsp;&nbsp;''
| Descendant of Gofraidh, descendant of Amhlaibh Fionn;,&nbsp;&nbsp;
|- 
| ''a ghallmhaoir <U+00F3> thuinn go tuinn,&nbsp;&nbsp;''
| his ''Gall'' stewards from sea to sea;&nbsp;&nbsp;
|-
| ''fleasga donna a ndiaidh an Ghoill,&nbsp;&nbsp;''
| following the ''Gall'' are stout youths;&nbsp;&nbsp;
|- 
| ''do chloinn Bhriain is Cholla is Chuinn.&nbsp;&nbsp;''
| of the progeny of [[Brian Boru|Brian]] and [[Colla Uais|Colla]] and [[Conn C<U+00E9>tchathach|Conn]].<ref>McLeod & Bateman, ''Duanaire na Sracaire'', p. 79.</ref>
|}
</blockquote> ''Gall'' is a word that originally meant "Foreigner" or "Norseman" (later "Lowlander"), and might be meant to refer to someone from the region of Innse Gall, i.e. from the Hebrides. It is not clear who Gofraidh or Amhlaibh Fionn are, but they may refer to some of the [[Norse-Gaelic]] rulers of Mann and Dublin, possibly [[Amla<U+00ED>b Conung|Amhlaibh Conung]] and [[Godred Crovan|Gofraidh Crobh<U+00E1>n]].<ref>McLeod & Bateman, ''Duanaire na Sracaire'', pp. 502-3.</ref>  

===Miracle from the Manx chronicle===
The ''Chronicle of the Kings of Man'' related a story that may have involved Domhnall. In 1249, according to the text, following the death of [[Haraldr <U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fsson]] King of Mann, the new ruler [[Haraldr Gu<U+00F0>r<U+00F8><U+00F0>arson]] persecuted one of the old king's favourite vassals. This persecuted vassal, described as an "aged man", was named as ''Dofnaldus'', i.e. Domhnall. Domhnall and his young son were subsequently imprisoned. Owing to the intervention of [[St Mary]], Domhnall and his son managed to escape, and brought their thanks and story to the [[Rushden Abbey|Abbey of St Mary of Rushden]], the monastic house at which the ''Chronicle'' was kept.<ref>Woolf, ''Dead Man", p. 78.</ref>

===Possible charter===
There is a [[charter]] allegedly issued by Domhnall to [[Paisley Abbey]], found in the [[cartulary]] of that abbey.<ref>Mcdonald, ''Kingdom of the Isles'', pp. 148-9.</ref> In this charter Domhnall is given no title, instead merely described by his genealogy: ''Douenaldus filius Reginaldi filii Sumerledi'', "Domhnall, son of Raghnall, son of Somhairle".<ref>Sellar, "Hebridean Sea-Kings", p. 200, n. 57; the charter is ''Paisley Registrum'', 126.</ref> This charter is thought by some historians to be spurious, mainly because the witness list and wording of the charter are, in the words of [[Alex Woolf]], "suspiciously similar" to those in a genuine charter of Domhnall's son [[Aonghas M<U+00F3>r]]. Presumably, the explanation is that the monks of Paisley Abbey at some later stage may have thought it in their interest to replicate Aonghas' charter in order to add the authority of the founder of Clan Donald to their land rights.<ref>Woolf, "Dead Man", p. 78; Sellar, "Hebridean Sea-Kings", p. 200; see also Duncan & Brown, "Argyll and the Isles", p. 198, n. 8.</ref>

==Death==
In 1247 [[Maurice Fitzgerald, Baron of Offaly|Maurice fitz Gerald]], [[Justiciar of Ireland]], invaded the territory of [[Maoilsheachlainn <U+00D3> Domhnaill]], [[King of T<U+00ED>r Chonaill]],  defeating and killing this Irish king at the [[Battle of Ballyshannon]].<ref>Woolf, "Dead Man", p. 77.</ref> According to the ''[[Annals of Loch C<U+00E9>]]'', one of Maoilsheachlainn's allies who died at Ballyshannon was a ''Mac Somhairle'', a "Descendant of Somhairle": <blockquote>Mac Somhairle, king of Argyll, and the nobles of the Cenel-Conaill besides, were slain.<ref>''Annals of Loch C<U+00E9>'', s.a. 1247.7, available [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100010A/text011.html here].</ref></blockquote> The Irish historian Se<U+00E1>n Duffy suggested that this "Mac Somhairle" was Domhnall mac Raghnall. Duffy's main argument is that the seventeenth-century ''Book of Clanranald'' relayed a tradition that Domhnall had been invited by the Irish at [[Tara]] to come "to take the headship of the Western Isles and the greater part of the Gaels".<ref>Duffy, "Bruce Brothers", p. 56.</ref> 

McDonald believed that this "Mac Somhairle" referred to [[Donnchadh mac Dubhghaill]], while Sellar thought that the clear favourite for this "Mac Somhairle" should be Domhnall's older brother Ruaidhri.<ref>McDonald, ''Kingdom of the Isles'', p. 94.</ref> Alex Woolf more recently offered an extended case for the latter view, arguing on a number of grounds that Ruaidhri is by far the best candidate.<ref>Woolf, "Dead Man", pp. 77-85; see also Woolf, "Age of Sea Kings", p. 108.</ref>

Assuming that Domhnall is not the "dead man at Ballyshannon", the date of Domhnall's death cannot be fixed. MacDonald tradition placed it in 1289, a tradition usually rejected by modern historians as falling far too late.<ref>McDonald, ''Kingdom of the Isles'', pp. 95-6.</ref> R. Andrew McDonald suggested that Domhnall's death must have taken place before 1263, when King Haakon collected the allegiance of Aonghas M<U+00F3>r in the Hebrides.<ref>McDonald, ''Kingdom of the Isles'', p. 96.</ref> Alex Woolf argued that it very likely must have occurred before February 1256, when Domhnall's son Aonghas made a grant to Paisley Abbey is his own name as "Lord of Islay", suggesting at the very least that Domhnall had retired.<ref>Munro & Munro, ''Acts'', p. 280; Woolf, "Dead Man", p. 79.</ref>

==Legacy==
Domhnall's main legacy is being the eponymous founding figure of the famous MacDonald kindred of Islay.<ref>McDonald, ''Kingdom of the Isles'', p. 96; Sellar, "Hebridean Sea-Kings", p. 194, table ii.</ref> Early modern MacDonald tradition thought of Domhnall as a "Lord of the Isles", like his descendants. One such tradition related that King [[Alexander II of Scotland]] sent a messenger to Domhnall, requesting that he hold the Isles from Alexander rather than the "King of Denmark"; Domhnall was said to have responded that his predecessors<blockquote>Had their rights of the Isles from the crown of Denmark, which were renewed by the present king thereof.<ref>Quoted in McDonald, ''Kingdom of the Isles'', p. 95.</ref></blockquote> This anachronistic portrayal of the struggle between King [[Haakon IV of Norway]] and the Scottish crown for overlordship of the western seaboard of Scotland, giving Domhnall such a senior role, does not fit with the contemporary evidence. When it was written down, Denmark ruled Norway and the MacDonalds were well established as the rulers the Isles. However, during most of his life Domhnall was probably subordinate to his older brother, [[Ruaidhri mac Raghnaill]], and as Alex Woolf has said "there is little or no explicit contemporary evidence that Domhnall was a significant figure during his lifetime".<ref>Woolf, "Dead Man", p. 78.</ref> 

Nevertheless, Domhnall appears to have left his son Aonghas a lordship of respectable size centred on [[Islay]]. According to a praise-poem written for this son, the realm the latter inherited from Domhnall included "every house from [[Isle of Mull|Mull]] to [[Kintyre]]" (''gach teach <U+00F3> Mhuile go Maoil'').<ref>Wilson & Bateman, ''Duanaire na Sracaire'', p. 83.</ref>
