Upon its release, the album received mixed to average reviews from most music critics, based on an aggregate score of 53/100 from [[Metacritic]].<ref name="Metacritic">[http://www.metacritic.com/music/taking-chances/critic-reviews ''Taking Chances'' (2008): Reviews]. [[Metacritic]]. Retrieved on 2011-03-09.</ref> Stephen Thomas Erlewine from [[Allmusic]] rated it 3 stars and said that Taking Chances "It's an album of its time: it offers extravagance in the guise of self-help, which can be alluring in doses--especially those bizarre blues-rockers--but it's just too much of a very expensive yet not particularly tasteful thing.<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/taking-chances-r1213654|title= Taking Chances - Allmusic Review|publisher=Allmusic|date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}</ref> The ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' review said that: "Packing an emotional wallop, Chances should quash critics who insist that Dion's voice is stainless steel".<ref name="Billboard"/> Bill Lamb of [[About.com]] rate the album three-stars out of five, and said: "listening to 16 consecutive songs can be an endurance test for even the most ardent Celine fan. 14 of the songs here suffer, to various degrees, from leaning to the ordinary or seeming to lack in inspired artistic fire. However, they are sandwiched by 2 brilliant tracks that, sadly, give a hint of what Taking Chances might have been."<ref name="about"/> Sarah Rodhman from the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' commented that: "Are chances taken? Not many, but there are rewards if you're willing to enjoy Dion's precise vocalizing and the hooky songs."<ref name="Boston Globe"/> The ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' review saw that: "It's cool that Dion can mimic everyone from [[Shakira]] to [[Sam Phillips]]...but her appalling [[Janis Joplin]] impression is a Chance too far."<ref name="EW"/> Sal Cinquemani from ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' opined that: "The laborious 16-track record purportedly finds the queen of adult contemporary-turned-Vegas attraction taking chances by modernizing her treacly power ballad sound with lots of overdubbed guitars and of-the-moment collaborators".<ref name="Slant"/> The [[Amazon.com]] review was positive, saying that: "As far as standard Celine fare goes, in fact, Chances is likely her strongest non-French outing since 2002's "[[A New Day Has Come]];" nobody unfolds a lyric with more care or nuance."<ref name="Amazon"/> The ''[[NOW (magazine)|NOW]]'' review, expressed that: "The album is also comfortably ignorant of the times. With its feathery production and common pop arrangements, it could have come out in 1996".<ref name="NOW"/> Edna Gundersen from [[USA Today]] said that: "With Chances, the diva seems to be stretching artistic muscles, yoga-style not aerobically, and seeking an escape from expectations".<ref name="USA Today"/> Ashante Infantry from ''[[Toronto Star]]'' conclued that: "Taking Chances, Dion's 10th album, finds her doing just that. With an obvious reach for contemporary radio, Dion padded the efforts of longtime collaborators with in-the-now hitmakers: [[Ne-Yo]], [[Linda Perry]] and [[Ben Moody]], who co-wrote the self-empowering anthem "This Time" about an abused woman breaking free. The result is an edgier rock sound that won't alienate loyal fans, but may engage some new ones".<ref name="Toronto Star"/>

==''Taking Chances'' Tour==

The show, directed by [[Jamie King]] (famously known for his work with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]), combined Dion's performances with color, fashion and dance. C<U+00E9>line Dion performed some of her biggest hits, along with songs from ''Taking Chances''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celinedion.com/celinedion/english/whatsgoinon_pr.cgi?id=35|title=Celine Dion announces highly anticipated 2008-09 North American tour|accessdate=2007-11-07|work=Dion<U+2019>s Official Website}}</ref>

The two hour show was divided into four segments: soul, rock, Middle-Eastern and, fashion-victim. Dion was supported by eight dancers (4 male and 4 female). Rehearsals took place in December 2007 in [[Primm, Nevada]] and [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]].

The tour setup included about twenty LED screens, among them one that orbited above the stage, plus conveyor belts and elevators. Dion pre-recorded a selection of videos for her show. The introduction video showed her driving a car at high-speed, set to a remix of "[[I Drove All Night]]" as the beginning of her concert. There have been 2 versions of the introduction video: The first version showed footage of Dion's career, and was seen in all South Africa, Asia, Australia, and some European dates before the second version, which was footage from cities Dion visited during the tour. As the tour went on, the intro video shaped up and more cities ended up being added. Another video showed the singer dressed in varying fashions over the years, with the "[[My Heart Will Go On]]" remix in the background. 

Before that date, the show wasn't on a central stage (except in [[Japan]]) for logistics reasons. After two and a half months, Dion rehearsed again to perfect the show for the "in the round" setup. Because of Dion's bilingual career and the restrictions of certain arenas and stadiums on the tour, King had to direct and choreograph three separate shows. One show featured a set-list mostly of English language songs, and was performed in-the-round using the full system of mobile screens, elevators, and conveyor belts.  A second show also featured the center stage arrangement, but included about ten French language songs for performances in Francophone countries.  A third, less complex show was used where the center stage arrangement would not fit into the venue or where it would be impractical to transport the stage. An end stage setup was used in these cases, and featured a massive central video screen and a lighting system that engulfed the stage in brilliant blue and red from above on all three sides. Before the European leg, the central and end stage setups were redone, changing lights and cues, in order for the three separate shows to fit in these two stages. Dion premiered new costumes when the European tour began.

Dion and her band rehearsed about 60 tracks, both in English and French.  Among those, about 27 songs were performed in each show, according to each visited market. "[[Pour que tu m'aimes encore]]" was performed throughout the whole tour. It is the best-selling French-language single of all time, and one of the only French songs in music history to achieve chart success in many non-Francophone countries. The singer also performed several cover songs, including: [[James Brown]]'s "[[I Got the Feelin']]" and "[[It's a Man's Man's Man's World]]," and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[We Will Rock You]]" and "[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]" (although the last two were dropped starting with the October 27 [[Winnipeg]] show). She also performed [[Kiki Dee]]'s "[[I've Got the Music in Me]]" but the song was removed after concerts in South Korea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.com/divertissement/musique/dossiers/2008/02/07/4833942-jdm.html|title=Cap sur l'Afrique|date=2008-02-09|accessdate=2008-02-09|last=Parent|first=Marie-Jo<U+00EB>lle|work=Journal de Montr<U+00E9>al|language=French}}</ref>

This was Dion's second in the round concert and her very first world tour since her 1998-1999 [[Let's Talk About Love Tour]].
