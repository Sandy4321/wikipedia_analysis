The '''Torre Agbar''', or Agbar Tower, is a 21st-century [[skyscraper]] at [[Pla<U+00E7>a de les Gl<U+00F2>ries Catalanes, Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. It was designed by [[France|French]] [[architect]] [[Jean Nouvel]] and built by [[Grupo ACS|Dragados]]<ref>[http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0000429 Structurae database]</ref>. It opened in June 2005 and was inaugurated officially by the [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King of Spain]] on [[16 September]] [[2005]]. The Torre Agbar is located in the [[Poblenou]] neighborhood of Barcelona and is named after its owners, the [[Grupo Agbar|Agbar Group]], a holding company whose interests include the Barcelona water company [[Aig<U+00FC>es de Barcelona]].<ref>http://www.agbar.es/esp/a-9_quienes_somos.asp Agbar corporate Web site</ref>

== Design ==

According to [[Jean Nouvel]], the shape of the Torre Agbar was inspired by [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]], a mountain near Barcelona, and by the shape of a geyser rising into the air. Jean Nouvel, in an interview, described it as having a [[phallus|phallic]] character.<ref name="Jean Nouvel interview"/><ref>[http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=es&u=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cataluna/gran/supositorio/elpepuespcat/20030108elpcat_3/Tes El gran supositorio] Article by El Pais, quote: ''The suppository of Agbar rises to the heavens quickly'' (Translation by Google)</ref> As a result of its unusual shape, the building is known by several nicknames, such as "el supositori" (the [[suppository]]), "l'ob<U+00FA>s" (the [[Shell (projectile)|shell]]) and some more [[scatological]] ones.<ref name="Jean Nouvel interview">[http://www.websindical.com/atab/noticies/noti28.htm Not<U+00ED>cias Agbar] (Includes interview with Jean Nouvel) quote from the Jean Nouvel interview: ''In Torre Agbar call the suppository. What do you think? <U+00A1>Normal! But I am sure that his phallic character will be diluted when finished. What characterized the tower will be a big vibration of light. Lovers of the mottoes you find another name, sure.'' [''[[sic]]''] ([http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=es&u=http://www.websindical.com/atab/noticies/noti28.htm Translation by Google])</ref> It is also somewhat similar in shape to Sir Norman Foster's [[30 St. Mary Axe]] in London, often called "the Gherkin". It has 30,000 [[Square metre|m<U+00B2>]] (323,000 [[Square foot|ft<U+00B2>]]) of above-ground [[office]] space, 3,210 [[Square metre|m<U+00B2>]] (34,500 [[Square foot|ft<U+00B2>]]) of technical service floors with installations and 8,351 [[Square metre|m<U+00B2>]] (90,000 [[Square foot|ft<U+00B2>]]) of services, including an [[auditorium]]. The Agbar Tower measures 144.4 m (473.75 ft) in height<ref>[http://www.torreagbar.com/home.asp Torre agbar homepage]</ref> and consists of 38 [[floor|storeys]], including four underground levels.

[[Image:Torre agbar leds.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Details of the LED luminous devices]]
Its design combines a number of different [[architecture|architectural]] concepts, resulting in a striking structure built with [[reinforced concrete]], covered with a [[facade]] of [[glass]], and over 4,500 [[window]] openings cut out of the structural concrete. The building stands out in Barcelona; it is the third tallest building in Barcelona, only after the [[Hotel Arts|Arts Hotel]] and the [[Torre Mapfre|Mapfre Tower]], both 154 m (505.25 ft).

A defining feature of the building is its nocturnal illumination. It has 4,500 [[LED]] luminous devices that allow generation of luminous images in the fa<U+00E7>ade. In addition, it has [[sensor|temperature sensors]] in the outside of the tower that regulate the opening and closing of the glass blinds of the fa<U+00E7>ade of the building, reducing the consumption of energy for air conditioning. It will house the head office of the [[Aig<U+00FC>es de Barcelona]] Group (Spanish: "Aguas de Barcelona", English: "Waters of Barcelona").
