On 9 January 2013, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] sanctioned Coronel Barreras under the so-called [[Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act]] (sometimes referred to simply as the "Kingpin Act"), for his involvement with the Sinaloa Cartel's illicit activities and coordinating drug trafficking operations for Guzm<U+00E1>n. The designation also sanctioned [[Damaso L<U+00F3>pez N<U+00FA>nez]] (alias "El Licenciado"), another Sinaloa Cartel chief who worked directly with Guzm<U+00E1>n. Under the Kingpin Act, the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] (OFAC) virtually froze all the assets Coronel Barreras had in the U.S. and prohibited Americans from doing any kind of business with them.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Edward|title=US Treasury Sanctions Father-in-Law of 'El Chapo'|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/us-treasuary-sanctions-el-chapos-father-in-law|accessdate=27 May 2014|newspaper=[[InSight Crime]]|date=10 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Treasury Targets Leading Figures of Sinaloa Cartel|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tf1817.aspx|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]|accessdate=27 May 2014|date=9 January 2013}}</ref>
