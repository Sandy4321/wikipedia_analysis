The '''Red Cow interchange''' is a major road junction in west [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]] on the [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50]], meeting the [[N7 road|N7]] [[Naas]] [[Road]] (to [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and [[Limerick]]) at a free-flow grade separated junction which incorporates a light railway line. The N7 route commences at this junction, junction 1 on the N7 and junction 9 on the M50, and the ''Naas Road'' from the city centre via [[Inchicore]] to the Red Cow interchange comprises part of the [[R110 road|R110]] and the [[R810 road|R810]]. The junction is the busiest road junction in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Before a recent upgrade it frequently had tailbacks several kilometres long on the routes leading to it.

==Original configuration==

Opened in 1990 as part of the [[M50 motorway (Ireland)| M50]] Western Parkway project, the junction was originally a grade separated interchange from the point of view of M50 travellers, however for N7 motorists it was a [[signal-controlled roundabout]] with negotiation of traffic lights required for all movements. From 1994 onwards the roundabout became the terminus of the [[N7 road]] following the decision to detrunk the road inside the M50 (becoming the [[R110 road]]).

The nickname ''Mad Cow roundabout'' was commonly used to refer to the junction, referring to the slang term given to cattle suffering from the brain disease [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]]. The actual name of the roundabout refered to the adjoining ''Red Cow Moran Hotel''.

==Upgrade==

The junction was upgraded as part of works on the M50 motorway. Congestion was alleviated by providing a third level of grade-separation, allowing Dublin&ndash;Cork/Limerick traffic to travel from the M50 to the N7 without having to navigate a roundabout. The [http://www.m50.ie/pages/pressarea-n7-interchange2.htm junction upgrade] was completed in December 2008. A similar upgrade of the N4/M50 interchange was completed on 20 December 2007. [http://www.m50.ie/pages/n4.htm].

The junction is now a rather tight spaghetti style interchange. There is also a plan to upgrade the junction at [[Newlands Cross]] to a grade-separated interchange and preliminary works began in the Autumn of 2008. 

==Luas depot==
The tram depot for the [[Luas]] Red Line, a halt (Red Cow) and a ''Park and Ride'' are located at the interchange.

The Luas complex added extra traffic to the already-busy junction when it opened in 2004. The tramline crossed the [[slip road]]s on the southern side of the junction, as well as crossing half of the road from the city centre before it met the junction (the tram line reaches this point by following the median of the road). The issue of the traffic disruption added by the tram system was seemingly ignored during the original planning of the Luas system. After an outcry over this, government ministers were involved in discussions about the system passing over the junction on "stilts", while the actual construction of the system was underway. 

The new interchange keeps trams separated from all other traffic.
