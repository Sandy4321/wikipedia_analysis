'''''Sphecius grandis''''', also called the '''western cicada killer''', is a colony-forming species of [[Sphecius|cicada killer wasp]] (''Sphecius''). The western species shares the same [[Nest|nesting biology]] as its fellow species, the eastern cicada killer ''[[Sphecius speciosus|S. speciosus]]''.<ref name="jstor">{{cite journal |jstor=25084766 | title=Provisioning by female Western cicada killer wasps, ''Sphecius grandis'' (Hymnoptera: Sphecidae): influence of body size and emergence time on individual provisioning success | author=Hastings, Jon | journal=[[Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society]] | year=1986 | month=April | volume=59 | issue=2 | pages=262<U+2013>268}}</ref> ''S. grandis'', like all other species of the genus ''Sphecius'', mainly provide [[cicada]]s for their offspring.<ref name="jstor" /> They are colonial and mate and [[Voltinism|brood once in a year]], in July and early August.<ref name="jstor2">{{cite journal |jstor=4600338 | title=Protandry in western cicada killer wasps (''Sphecius grandis'', Hymnoptera: Sphecidae) and empirical study of emergence time and mating opportunity | author=Hastings, Jon | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | year=1989 | month=April | volume=25 | issue=4 | pages=255<U+2013>260}}</ref> The wasp is on average 5{{&nbsp}}cm (2{{&nbsp}}in) in length and is amber-yellow with yellow rings on the [[abdomen]].<ref name="cdri">{{cite web | url=http://www.cdri.org/fieldguides/wasps/taxonomy/robust-yellow-group.html | title=Wasps (Order: Hymenoptera) <U+2013> Robust Yellow Group | publisher=[[Chihuahuan Desert Nature Center and Botanical Gardens]] | accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref>

Wasps of the [[genus]] ''Sphecius'' are not habitually aggressive and save their [[venom]] for cicadas which they paralyze and take back to their nests.<ref name="cdri" /> The female catches around four or more cicadas for provisioning, places them in her brood cell and then proceeds to lay an egg in the cell.<ref name="cdri" /> The species is [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Central America]] and the [[Western United States]],<ref name="sandwas">[[#Evans|Evans (2007)]], p. 34</ref> and is found at a higher mean altitude that other species of ''Sphecius''.<ref name="benth" /> The males emerge earlier than females,<ref name="jstor2" /> but generally die after only a couple of days.<ref name="cdri" />

Identifying and differentiating from other species is difficult.<ref name="bionica" /> At first, the method to tell between ''S. grandis'' and ''S. convallis'' was to compare the colour of the gastral [[Tergum|tergites]], ''S. grandis'' was originally thought to have yellow markings on all five gastral tergites and ''S. convallis'' to have three markings, but this was found to be inadequate.<ref name="bionica" /> A new method was recently devised which allowed identification through examination of the coloration of the tergite markings in the case of an anomaly.<ref name="bionica" />

==Taxonomy==
The western cicada killer was first described by American naturalist [[Thomas Say]] in 1824 as ''Stizus grandis''. Its species name is the [[Latin]] adjective ''grandis'' meaning "large". It is one of five species of the genus ''[[Sphecius]]'' in North America.<ref name="bionica">{{cite journal | url=http://www.bio-nica.info/biblioteca/Holliday2006Sphecius.pdf | title=Improved Key to New World Species of Sphecius (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae | author=Holliday, Charles W.;  Coelho, Joseph R. | journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America | year=2006 | volume=99 | pages=793<U+2013>798}}</ref> The species was collected by D. Maddox on September 8, 1957, in [[Madera Canyon]], Arizona and correctly identified by Charles W. Holliday.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://essigdb.berkeley.edu/cgi/eme_query?bnhm_id=EMEC55413&one=T&OK2SHOWPRIVATE=1 | title=Detail of Catalog ID# EMEC55413 | publisher=Essig Museum of Entomology | date=December 6, 2004 | accessdate=August 15, 2011 | author=Nishida, Gordon}}</ref>

More recently, it has been suspected that the western cicada killer represents more than one species.<ref name="zoot" /> It co-occurs with the eastern cicada killer (''S. speciosus'') and Pacific cicada killer (''S. convallis'') at [[Big Bend National Park]] in Texas.<ref name="zoot" /> There the three wasps hunt and nest in the same locales, and the eastern and western cicada killers hunt the same cicada species. Analysis of [[mitochondrial DNA]] showed that there were two divergent [[clade]]s each within the western and pacific cicada killers, and that one clade of each were closely related to each other. This was possibly as a result of [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ization between them. The two populations of the western cicada killer appeared to be split by the [[Rocky Mountains]], with one occurring mainly to the south and east, the other to the west.<ref name="zoot"> {{cite journal|author=Hastings, Jon M.; Schultheis, Patrick J.; Whitson, Maggie; Holliday, Charles W.; Coelho, Joseph R. & Mendell, Angela M.|year=2008|title=DNA barcoding of new world cicada killers (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae)|journal=[[Zootaxa]]|volume=1713|pages=27<U+2013>38|url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2008/f/zt01713p038.pdf}}</ref>

==Description==
At around 5{{&nbsp}}cm (2{{&nbsp}}in) in length, the western cicada killer is very similar to its eastern cousin, ''[[Sphecius speciosus]]'', with amber stripes and a yellow abdomen.<ref name="cdri" /> On average, female [[forewing]] length lies between 2.5 and 3{{&nbsp}}cm (1-1.4{{&nbsp}}in).<ref name="jstor" /> Females are larger than males and live for a long enough time to produce a brood in a year, whereas the males die within only a few days, with enough time to impregnate a female.<ref name="cdri" /> In Steven J. Phillips' book ''A Natural History of the Sonoran Desert'', he referred to them as superficially resembling "huge yellowjackets or hornets" and stated that they are "powerful fliers with compound eyes".<ref>[[#Phillips|Phillips (1999)]], p. 346</ref> On average, males, far smaller than females, weigh 95{{nbsp;}}mg and females weigh 256{{nbsp;}}mg.<ref>[[#Vander Wall|Vander Wall (1990)]], p. 38</ref> It is thought that this weight difference is to account for the additive weight of having ovaries, developing eggs and to carry nutritional reserves.<ref name="jspss">{{cite journal | url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/3546021 | title=Sexual size dimorphism and flight behavior in cicada killers | author=Coelho, Joseph R. | journal=Oikos | year=1997 | month=June | volume=79 | issue=2 | pages=371-375 | doi=10.2307/3546021}}</ref> Despite this disproportionate ration, the flight muscle mass comparative to body mass was the same for both sexes.<ref name="jspss" />

===Identification===
Distinguishing ''S. grandis'' from the other four New World species (''S. convallis'', ''S. hogardii'', ''S. speciousus'', ''S. spectabilis'') of the genus ''Sphecius'' has been found to be difficult.<ref name="bionica" /> The female ''S. convallis'' was originally determined from the female ''S. grandis'' by the yellow marks from the first to third gastral [[Tergum|tergites]] on ''S. convallis'' and yellow marks on all tergites for ''S. grandis''.<ref name="bionica" /> However this was found to be insufficient because the positions of the markings can vary through different wasps of the same species.

Charles W. Holliday and Joseph R. Coelho devised a new key in 2004 to identify the ''Sphecius'' species.<ref name="bionica" /> In the experiment, they studied 4,451 wasps among the five New World species,<ref name="bionica" /> and came to the conclusion that the female ''S. convallis'' wasps examined had 98% yellow markings on gastral tergites one to four or less and ''S. grandis'' had 98% yellow markings from tergites one to five or greater.<ref name="bionica" /> The 2% percent of ''S. grandis'' that overlapped with ''S. convallis'' were determined by density of the punctation of the first tergite against the second.<ref name="bionica" /> The markings on ''S. grandis'' males were found to be the same as on females.<ref name="bionica" />

===Thermoregulation===
It has been found that the western cicada killer wasp is capable of thermoregulation which enables them to hunt for cicadas during the day.<ref name="sasi" /> A study by [[Quincy University]] showed that during territorial patrolling the species had a high and regulated [[thorax]] temperature.<ref name="scdir">{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306456507000332 | title=Thermoregulation in male western cicada killers (Sphecius grandis Say) in the Chihuahuan desert | author=Coelho, Joseph R. | journal=Journal of Thermal Biology | year=2007 | month=July | volume=32 | issue=5 | pages=270-275}}</ref> Experiments found that the wasp has the ability to move shift heat from its thorax to its abdomen and that the abdomen is generally kept colder than the thorax.<ref name="scdir" /> Dead wasps that were placed in the sun reached lethally high temperatures when compared to nearby plants.<ref name="scdir" />

==Life cycle==
===Birth, emergence and mating===
After [[Egg (biology)|hatching]], the offspring feed on the tissue of the cicadas provided by their mother. Males emerge before females and both genders are [[Sexual maturity|sexually receptive]] from emergence in July to early August.<ref name="jstor2" /> Famed English naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] postulated that the pattern of male emergence before females evolved by [[natural selection]] to improve the chances of the male mating.<ref name="jstor2" /> The timing of the emergence of females has evolved to correspond with the similar emergence of the cicada species of the area, ''[[Tibicen|Tibicen duryi]]'' and ''T. parallela'', which they hunt for the provisioning of their nests.<ref name="jstor2" /> Many have yellow markings located on their [[Tergum|tergites]] ([[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal_and_ventral|dorsal portion]]), although some have been found only from the first to fifth tergites.<ref name="bionica"/>

[[File:Cicada Killer Wasp.jpg|thumb|''[[Sphecius speciosus]]'' (eastern cicada killer) shares many behavioural similarities to ''Sphecius grandis''.]]
Because males emerge earlier than females, the males compete for mating territories surrounding the nests in which the females are located. During a fight, the males risk damaging the wings or their appendages by butting and grappling.<ref name="sandwas2">[[#Evans|Evans (2007)]], p. 35</ref> Another defence technique is to grab another male and carry it high into the air, which is thought to be a demonstration of strength.<ref name="sandwas2" /> A successful defence increases the chances that they pass on their genes.<ref name="jstor2" /> As a general rule, the larger the male the more predominant he is in battles.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hastings, Jon |year=1990 |title=Sexual-size dimorphism in Western cicada killer wasps, ''Sphecius grandis'' (Hymenoptera: Sphecidae) |journal=Transactions of the Kentucky Academy of Science |volume=50 |issue=1<U+2013>2 |pages=1<U+2013>5 |url=http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/104927#page/261/mode/1up}}</ref> Age influences the success in the defense and secutity of territory.<ref name="jsps2">{{cite journal | url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/25085103 | title=The Influence of Size, Age and Residency Status in Territory Defense in Male Western Cicada Killer Wasps (Sphecius grandis, Hymenotera: Sphecidae) | author=Hastings, Jon M. | journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society | year=1989 | month=July | volume=62 | issue=3 | pages=363-373}}</ref> The younger the wasp the greater chance of a successful takeover of territory.<ref name="jsps2" /> Some small males even engage in non-territorial mating tactics.<ref name="jsps2" />

As females are receptive on emergence, a lately emerging male will likely not get the chance to mate and die within only a few days.<ref name="jstor2" /> On female emergence from the nest, the female does not choose her mate, but instead [[Sexual intercourse|copulates]] with the first ready male counterpart of its species that she finds.<ref name="jstor2" /> Once the female has mated, she rebuffs all advances by other wasps.<ref name="bios" /> The low [[fecundity]] of the females means that additive mating would not increase the chances of successful birth.<ref name="bios" />

===Nesting and perching===
Males perch after emerging from their nest. They pick out an area close to a nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so as to have a better chance of mating.<ref name="jstor2" /> They tend to perch on many different [[Substrate (biology)|substrates]] such as stumps, pebbles, wood, weeds, grass blades and low tree branches.<ref name="tand">{{cite journal | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222937500770431 | title=The behaviour of western cicada killer males, Sphecius grandis (Sphecidae, Hymenoptera) | author=Alcock, John | journal=[[Journal of Natural History]] | year=1975 | volume=9 | issue=5 | pages=561<U+2013>566 |doi=10.1080/00222937500770431}}</ref> Males assume an alert posture, ready for a challenge from another male, or from a predator.<ref name="tand" /> One study by a [[Behavioral ecology|behavioural ecologist]], [[John Alcock (behavioral ecologist)|John Alcock]], showed that a large majority of the marked wasps returned to the same perch day after day, and two males swapped between two different sites.<ref name="tand" /> The species rarely perches on the ground.<ref name="scdir" />

All [[Sphecius|cicada killers]] are ground-nesting insects and nests can range from one to a group of hundreds of wasps.<ref name="zoot" /> Their tunnel is mainly made with sandy soil, frequently found under sidewalks.<ref name="natu" /> Approximately 90% of its life is spent underground as a larva.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sites.lafayette.edu/hollidac/research/biology-of-cicada-killer-wasps/ | title=Biology of cicada killer wasps | publisher=[[Lafayette College]] | date=November 16, 2009 | accessdate=August 15, 2011 | author=Kosmeier, Dieter}}</ref>

===Feeding and hunting habits===
''Sphecius grandis'' has very similar nesting and feeding habits to other members of its genus, most notably ''Sphecius speciosus''.<ref name="jstor" /><ref name="jstor2" /> As with ''S. speciosus'',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://entomology.ifas.ufl.edu/creatures/beneficial/cicada_killers.htm | title=Cicada killers | publisher=[[Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services]] | date=June, 2003 | accessdate=August 11, 2011 | author=A.

The wasps more prevalently hunt for female cicadas because they have more consumable tissue, but male cicadas are easier to locate which explains the systemic bias towards male kills.<ref name="bioo">{{cite journal |author=Charles W.

==Geographical distribution==
Western cicada killers are found at a higher altitude than most other ''Sphecius'' species and share [[sympatry]] with the species ''S. convallis'' and ''S. speciosus'', even though ''S. grandis'' are on average found at higher altitudes than ''S. convallis''.<ref name="benth">{{cite journal | url=http://www.benthamscience.com/open/toentoj/articles/V005/31TOENTOJ.pdf | title=The Geographic Distributions of Cicada Killers (Sphecius; Hymenoptera, Crabronidae) in the America | author=Coelho, Joseph R.; Holliday, Charles W.; Hastings, Jon M. | journal=The Open Entomology Journal | year=2011 | month=March | volume=5 | pages=31<U+2013>38}}</ref> A study showed that the mean elevation for ''S. grandis'' was 755 <U+00B1> 23.3, compared with the lower results of ''S. speciosus'' (219 <U+00B1> 4.7), ''S. convallis'' (582 <U+00B1> 30.9) and ''S. hogardii'' (18 <U+00B1> 5).<ref name="benth" /> The species is found from [[Central America]] to the [[Western United States]].<ref name="sandwas" /> ''S. grandis'' are the only cicada killers to be found in [[Utah]] and are most commonly found in [[riparian zones]].<ref name="benth" /> The species has been observed in such places in Mexico as [[Baja California Norte]], [[Baja California Sur]], [[Coahuila]], [[Nuevo Leon]], [[Tamaulipas]] and [[Yucat<U+00E1>n]] and also in [[Granada]] ([[Nicaragua]]), [[Guanacaste]] ([[Costa Rica]]) and [[Honduras]].<ref name="benth" />
