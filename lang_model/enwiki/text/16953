'''''Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)''''' is the [[debut album]] of American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[Wu-Tang Clan]], released November 9, 1993 on [[Loud Records]] and distributed through [[RCA Records]]. Recording sessions for the album took place during 1992 to 1993 at Firehouse Studio in [[New York City]], and it was mastered at [[The Hit Factory]]. The album's title originates from the martial arts film ''[[The 36th Chamber of Shaolin]]'' (1978). The group's ''de facto'' leader [[RZA]], also known as Prince Rakeem, produced the album entirely with heavy, eerie [[beats (music)|beats]] and a sound largely based on martial-arts movie clips and soul music samples.

The distinctive sound of ''Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)'' created a blueprint for [[hardcore hip hop]] during the 1990s and helped return New York City hip hop to national prominence. Its sound also became hugely influential in modern hip hop production, while the group members' explicit, humorous, and [[Free association (psychology)|free-associative]] lyrics have served as a template for many subsequent hip hop records. Serving as a landmark record in the era of hip hop known as the [[East Coast Renaissance]], its influence helped lead the way for several other East Coast hip hop artists, including [[Nas]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Mobb Deep]], and [[Jay-Z]].

Despite its raw, underground sound, the album had surprising chart success, peaking at number 41 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. By 1995, it was certified [[platinum album|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for shipments of one million copies in the United States. Initially receiving positive reviews from most music critics, ''Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)'' has been regarded by music writers as one of the most significant albums of the 1990s, as well as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all-time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 386 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].

== Conception ==
=== Background ===
In the late 1980s, cousins [[RZA|Robert Diggs]], [[GZA|Gary Grice]], and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard|Russell Jones]] formed a group named Force of the Imperial Master, also known as the [[All in Together Now Crew]].<ref name="Exclaim">{{cite web | last = Cowie  | first = Del F. | url = http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=914 | title = Days of the Wu at Exclaim.ca | work = | publisher =  | accessdate = November 6, 2006 }}</ref> Each member recorded under an alias: Grice as The Genius, Diggs as Prince Rakeem or The Scientist, and Jones as The Specialist. The group never signed to a major label, but caught the attention of the New York rap scene and was recognized by rapper [[Biz Markie]].<ref name="RZAInterview">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.hiphopcore.net/interviews/rza_english.php3 | title = RZA Interview at HipHopCore.net | work = | publisher = | accessdate = December 26, 2006 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060515072710/http://www.hiphopcore.net/interviews/rza_english.php3| archivedate = May 15, 2006}}</ref> By 1991, The Genius and Prince Rakeem were signed to separate record labels. The Genius released ''[[Words from the Genius]]'' (1991) on [[Cold Chillin' Records]] and Prince Rakeem released ''[[Ooh I Love You Rakeem]]'' (1991) on [[Tommy Boy Records]]. Both were soon dropped by their labels. Embittered but unbowed, they took on new monikers (The Genius became [[GZA]] while Prince Rakeem became [[RZA]]) and refocused their efforts. RZA discussed the matter in their release ''[[The Wu-Tang Manual]]'' (2005), stating "[Tommy Boy] made the decision to sign [[House of Pain]] over us. When they dropped me, I was thinking, 'Damn, they chose a bunch of whiteboy shit over me.'"<ref name="FirstSingle">{{cite web | last = Pfeifle | first = Sam | url = http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/arts/books/documents/04646062.asp | title = Days of the Wu&nbsp;<U+2014> The RZA looks inside the Clan at BostonPhoenix.com | work = | publisher =  | accessdate = October 16, 2006 }}</ref> RZA began collaborating with Dennis Coles, better known as [[Ghostface Killah]], another rapper from the [[Stapleton Projects]] apartment complex in [[Staten Island]]. The duo decided to create a hip hop group whose ethos would be a blend of "[[Eastern philosophy]] picked up from [[kung fu movies]], watered-down [[Nation of Islam]] preaching picked up on the New York streets, and comic books."<ref name = "FirstSingle"/>

In 1992, RZA and Ghostface joined forces with [[GZA]], Russell Jones (newly christened [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]), and five other New York [[Master of Ceremonies#Adoption in popular culture|MCs]] to form Wu-Tang Clan. RZA assumed leadership of the group and was largely responsible for its artistic direction. After some of the members' past experiences, Wu-Tang Clan was initially hesitant to accept a contract offer and demanded that each member retain solo recording rights. On the strength of the "Protect Ya Neck/Method Man" single, [[Loud Records]] and [[RCA]] acceded to their demands, paving the way for Wu-Tang Clan to release ''36 Chambers'' on those labels.

=== Recording ===
''Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)'' was recorded at Firehouse Studio in [[New York City]] from 1992 to 1993. The album was produced, mixed, arranged, and programmed by [[RZA]], and was [[Master recording|mastered]] at [[The Hit Factory]] in New York City by Chris Gehringer.<ref name="Discogs">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/Wu-Tang+Clan | title = Wu-Tang Clan Entry at Discogs.com | work = | publisher = | accessdate = October 12, 2006 }}</ref> Because of an extremely limited budget, the group was only able to record in a small, inexpensive studio; with up to eight of the nine Wu-Tang members in the studio at once, the quarters were frequently crowded.<ref name="Exclaim"/> To decide who appeared on each song, RZA forced the Wu-Tang rappers to [[Freestyle battle|battle]] with each other. This competition led to the track "Meth Vs. Chef", a battle between [[Method Man]] and [[Raekwon]] over the rights to rap over RZA's beat; this track was left off the Wu-Tang Clan's debut album but surfaced on Method Man's debut, ''[[Tical (album)|Tical]]'' (1994).<ref name="Exclaim"/>

=== Title significance ===
The true meaning of the album's title is not well known or understood. According to a [[The Nation of Gods and Earths|Five Percent]] philosophy, known as the Supreme Mathematics, the number 9 means <U+201C>to bring into existence,<U+201D> and this meant everything to the group<U+2019>s debut album. The group being made of 9 members, each having 4 chambers of the heart, which are 2 [[atrium (heart)|atria]], and 2 [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]]. All of this is the root for "36 Chambers", being that 9 x 4 = 36.

In reference to the 1978 [[kung fu]] film ''[[The 36th Chamber of Shaolin]]'' that the group enjoyed watching, the Clan considered themselves as lyrical masters of the 36 chambers, and arrived onto the rap scene while appearing to be ahead, and more advanced over others with "''knowledge of 36 chambers of hip hop music when everyone else in hip hop was striving to attain the knowledge of 35 lessons''." Also, while the human body has 108 [[pressure points]] (1 + 0 + 8 = 9), only the Wu-Tang martial artists learned and understood that 36 of those pressure points are deadly (9 + 36 = 45) (4 + 5 = 9) The lyrics and rhymes of the 9 members are to be considered as 36 deadly lyrical techniques for pressure points. All of this is the basis for the album title, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), being that 9 members x 4 chambers = 36. However, this is just a theory; the true significance of the title is not definitively known.<ref>Perkins, Brandon.

== Music ==
=== Production ===
Group leader RZA produced ''Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)'' by creating sonic collages from classic soul [[music sampling|samples]] and clips from [[martial arts]] movies such as ''[[Shaolin and Wu Tang]]'' (1981). He complemented the rappers' performances with "lean, menacing beats that evoked their gritty, urban surroundings more effectively than their words", according to Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web | last = Erlewine | first = Stephen Thomas | url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:knx1z82a2yvj | title = Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) (Japan) at Allmusic | work = | publisher = | accessdate = October 7, 2006 }}</ref> The use of soul samples and various esoteric clips, and the technique by which RZA employed them in his beats, was unique and largely unprecedented in hip hop.<ref name = "Alchemist"/> The gritty sound of ''Enter the Wu-Tang'' is due, at least in part, to the use of cheap equipment to produce the album.<ref name="RapReviews">{{cite web | last = Juon | first = Steve | url = http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/BTTL_36chambers.html | title = Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)  at Rapreviews.com | work = | publisher =  | accessdate = October 8, 2006 }}</ref>

Many critics argue that the minimalist means of production plays directly into the appealing "street" quality that makes the album a classic, including Ben Yew, who stated, "Because [RZA] didn't have the best mixing or recording equipment, the album is wrought with a 'dirty' quality<U+2014>the drums have more bass and are more hard-hitting than they are crisp and clean; the samples have an eerie, almost haunting type of echo; and the vocals, because each member's voice is already aggressive and gritty, perfectly match the production."<ref name = "ProudFlesh"/> Although [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] is given co-production credit on "Da Mystery of Chessboxin'" and [[Method Man]] is co-credited for "Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta F' Wit", critics and admirers universally credit RZA with developing a "dusty yet digital production style [that] helped legitimize the use of more diverse sample sources to the hardcore New York rap massive, breaking away from [[James Brown]] based beats and embracing a style that turned the ''[[Underdog (TV series)|Underdog]]'' theme into the menacing coda for a group of underground terrorists."<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite web | last = Pemberton  | first = Rolie | url = http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737/Staff_List_Top_100_Albums_of_the_1990s/page_7 | title = Pitchfork Feature: Top 100 Albums of the 1990s | work = | publisher = | accessdate = December 14, 2006 }}</ref>

=== Lyricism ===
''Enter the Wu Tang'' ushered in a new standard for hip hop at a time when hip hop music was dominated by the [[jazz rap|jazz-influenced]] styles of [[A Tribe Called Quest]], the [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] viewpoints of [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], and the rising popularity of [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast]] [[gangsta rap]]. The album's explicit, humorous and [[Free association (psychology)|free-associative]] lyrics have been credited for serving as a template for many subsequent hip hop records.<ref name="heimlich" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described the album as possessing an aesthetic that was "low on hype and production values [and] high on the idea that indigence is a central part of blackness." While the lyrical content on ''Enter the Wu-Tang'' generally varies from rapper to rapper, the basic themes are the same<U+2014>urban life, martial arts movies, comic book references, and [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]<U+2014>and the setting is invariably the harsh environment of [[New York City]]. The lyrics have a universally dark tone and seem at times to be simply aggressive cries. [[Allmusic]] contributor Steve Huey praises the lyricists for their originality and [[caustic humour|caustic humor]], stating "Some were outsized, theatrical personalities, others were cerebral storytellers and lyrical technicians, but each had his own distinctive style...Every track on ''Enter the Wu-Tang'' is packed with fresh, inventive rhymes, which are filled with martial arts metaphors, pop culture references (everything from Voltron to Lucky Charms cereal commercials to Barbra Streisand's "The Way We Were"), bizarre threats of violence, and a truly twisted sense of humor."<ref name="Huey"/>

With the exception of "Method Man" and [[GZA]]'s "Clan in da Front", every song features multiple rappers contributing verses of varying lengths.<ref name = "Tour<U+00E9>"/> The verses are essentially battle rhymes, mixed with humor and outsized tales of urban violence and drug use. There is some debate about whether the lyrics on ''36 Chambers'' are properly classified as [[gangsta rap]] or something else entirely.<ref name="ProudFlesh">{{cite web | last = Yew | first = Ben | url = http://www.proudfleshjournal.com/issue3/yew.htm | title = Retrospect for Hip-Hop: A Golden Age on Record? at ProudFleshJournal.com | work = | publisher = | accessdate = October 21, 2006 }}</ref> In a [[Stylus Magazine]] review, writer Gavin Mueller evokes the bleakness of the Wu-Tang [[world view]]:

{{quote|[T]he lyrics reach back to New York<U+2019>s own [[Rakim]]: dense battle rhymes potent with metaphors. Each Wu MC links his rhymes to crime and violence, allowing his preoccupations to surface subtly and indirectly, rather than spouting off overt gangsta-isms designed to shock...The hood imagery of the lyrics is utterly pervasive and uncompromising, immersing the listener in a foreign land smack in the middle of New York. There is no celebration here, and little hope.<ref name="Stylus">{{cite web | last = Mueller | first = Gavin | url = http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/weekly_article/the-wu-tang-clan-story-part-one.htm | title = The Wu-Tang Clan Story: Part One from Stylus Magazine | work = | publisher = | accessdate = October 21, 2006 }}</ref>|Gavin Mueller}}

All nine original Wu-Tang Clan members contribute vocals on ''Enter the Wu-Tang''. [[Masta Killa]] only appears on one track, contributing the last verse of "Da Mystery of Chessboxin'", but all the other rappers appear on at least two songs. Method Man and Raekwon are the most prolific of the group, featured on eight tracks. Though the performers have widely differing techniques, the chemistry between them is a key ingredient of the album's success.<ref name="RapReviews">{{cite web | last = Juon | first = Steve | url = http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/BTTL_36chambers.html | title = Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) Review at RapReviews.com | work = | publisher = | accessdate = November 25, 2006 }}</ref> [[Pitchfork Media]] asserts that "Half the charm is in the cast's idiosyncrasies: ODB's hovering sing-song, Raekwon's fake stutter, Ghostface's verbal tics, Method Man's hazy, dusted voice."<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737/Staff_List_Top_100_Albums_of_the_1990s/page_7 | title = Pitchfork Feature: Top 100 Albums of the 1990s at PitchforkMedia.com | work = | publisher = | accessdate = December 14, 2006 }}</ref>

"[[Protect Ya Neck]]" and "Tearz" were the first tracks recorded by the Wu-Tang Clan. "Protect Ya Neck" is a free-associative and braggadocious [[battle rap]] featuring eight of the nine Wu-Tang members, and "Tearz" tells stories of a little kid getting shot (RZA's little brother), and another one who contracts [[HIV]] after having unprotected sex. They were independently released as the "Protect Ya Neck"/"After Laughter Comes Tears" single, which [[RZA]] financed by demanding $100 ([[USD]]) from each rapper who wanted a verse on the [[A-side and B-side|A-side]].<ref name="Exclaim"/><ref name="FirstSingle">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/arts/books/documents/04646062.asp | title = Days of the Wu&nbsp;<U+2014> The RZA looks inside the Clan | work = | publisher =  | accessdate = October 16, 2006 }}</ref> The single was re-released in a much larger pressing, with "[[Method Man (song)|Method Man]]" as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]].<ref name="Protect">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.buy.com/prod/Enter_The_Wu_Tang_36_Chambers_Explicit_Version/q/loc/109/60132453.html | title = Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers (Explicit Version) at Buy.com | work = | publisher =  | accessdate = October 6, 2006 }}</ref>

"Method Man" reached number 69 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number 17 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Rap Tracks]] chart. "Method Man" gained significant airplay partly for its catchy refrain, which copies the refrain of [[Hall & Oates]]' "Method of Modern Love" ("The M-E-T-H-O-D...Man").

"[[C.R.E.A.M.]]", featuring [[Raekwon]] and [[Inspectah Deck]], was the second single from the album and the first new A-side to be released after the group signed with Loud/RCA. Its lyrics deal with the struggle of poverty and the desire to earn money by any means. It was the Wu-Tang Clan's most successful single, reaching number 60 on the ''Billboard Hot 100'' and number 8 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. The single topped the [[Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales]] chart. ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' describes "C.R.E.A.M." as the standout track on ''36 Chambers''.<ref name="Blender">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=126 | title = 500 CDs You Must Own: Hip-Hop at Blender.com | work = | publisher = | accessdate = October 2, 2006 }}</ref> "Can It Be All So Simple", featuring [[Ghostface Killah]] and Raekwon, was the album's third single. The single failed to chart on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, but reached number 24 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart in 1994. A [[remix]] of the song was included on Raekwon's debut solo album ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...]]'' (1995).

The group made music videos for the three A-sides and for "Method Man", "Da Mystery of Chessboxin'", and "Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit". As the group's profile increased, the quality of their videos improved; though the "Protect Ya Neck" video resembled a home movie, later videos were directed by rising hip hop music video director [[Hype Williams]]. The videos received almost no airplay on [[MTV]], but were extremely popular on video-by-request channels such as [[The Box (US TV channel)|The Box]].<ref name="TheBox">{{cite web | last = Ward | first = Jacob | url = http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.02/newmedia.html?pg=7 | title = Where MTV Fears to Tread at Wired.com | work = | publisher = | accessdate = December 27, 2006 }}</ref> [[Tour<U+00E9>]] wrote in his 1993 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' review that "in Brooklyn, N.Y., right now and extending back a few months, the reigning fave is the Wu-Tang Clan, who are to the channel what [[Guns N' Roses]] are to MTV."<ref name = "Tour<U+00E9>"/>

Upon its release, ''Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)'' received positive reviews from most music critics. In an article for ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'', The Ghetto Communicator wrote "This record is harsh, but so is the world that we live in. For B-boys n'girls who come from the core of the hard, this is the hip-hop album you've been waiting for".<ref name=TheSource/> ''Rolling Stone'''s review was decidedly ambivalent, praising the album's sound, but noting that "Wu-Tang...are more ciphers than masterful creations. In refusing to commodify themselves, they leave blank the ultimate canvas<U+2014>the self."<ref name = "Tour<U+00E9>"/> ''Entertainment Weekly'' was more enthusiastic, giving the album an A, and writing that "With its rumble jumble of drumbeats, peppered with occasional piano plunking, ''Enter'' has a raw, pass-the-mike flavor we haven't heard since rap was pop's best-kept secret."<ref name="Bernard"/> In his consumer guide for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', critic [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album an A- rating,<ref name="Christgau"/> indicating "the kind of garden-variety good record that is the great luxury of musical micromarketing and overproduction".<ref>{{cite web|last=Christgau|first= Robert|url= http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg90/grades-90s.php |title=CG Keys to Icons: Grades 1990-|publisher=RobertChristgau.com|accessdate= 2010-02-28}}</ref> Christgau found the group "grander" and "goofier" than their "[[West Coast hip hop|West Coast]] opposite numbers" and concluded "Expect the masterwork this album's reputation suggests and you'll probably be disappointed--it will speak directly only to indigenous hip hoppers.

{{quote|This is the sound of accidental fame. Something as unique and unusual as this record isn't supposed to find itself at the height of commercial viability; it's supposed to smolder underground, hidden from the view of mainstream America, who surely would not be ready for such a challenge. But America was ready, in part because this one challenged convention, not listeners. Sure, its sloppy drum programming, bizarre song structures, and unpolished sound quality disturbed commercial rap purists, but the talent was so inherent and obvious, and the charisma so undeniable, that it propelled the Wu-Tang Clan to the height of the rap game, and today stands not just as the hip-hop classic that introduced the concept of obscure thematic characters (each member's name references old kung-fu movies), but also bridged the gap between traditional old-school sensibilities and the technical lyricism of today.<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737/Staff_List_Top_100_Albums_of_the_1990s/page_7 | title = Pitchfork Feature: Top 100 Albums of the 1990s | work = | publisher = | accessdate = December 14, 2006 }}</ref>|Rollie Pemberton}}

== Influence ==
=== East Coast hip hop ===
''Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)'' is one of the most celebrated and influential albums in [[History of hip hop music|hip hop history]].<ref name="ProudFlesh"/> Adam Heimlich of the ''[[New York Press]]'' considers the album a touchstone of [[hardcore hip-hop]], a gritty, stripped-down, dark and violent sub-genre of hip hop and the signature sound of [[New York City]]'s rap scene during the mid-1990s. He writes that, "the Wu-Tang Clan...all but invented 90s New York rap, back when the notion of an East Coast gangsta still meant [[Schoolly D]] or [[Kool G. Rap]]....[They] designed the manner and style in which New York artists would address what [[Snoop Dogg|Snoop]] and [[Dr. Dre|Dre]] had made rap<U+2019>s hottest topics: drugs and violence."<ref name="heimlich">{{cite web| last = Heimlich | first = Adam | url = http://www.nypress.com/15/4/news&columns/feature.cfm | title = 2002, Hiphop's Year One: Nas, Mobb Deep and Wu-Tang Clan Face 9/11 | format = Online Article Column | work = The [[New York Press]]: Volume 15,  Issue 4 | publisher = | accessdate = April 1, 2006 }}</ref> As the album helped return New York City hip hop to national prominence, a new generation of New York rappers, many of them inspired by the Wu-Tang Clan's example, released a flurry of classic albums that later became known as the [[East Coast Renaissance]].<ref name="Huey"/> ''Enter the Wu-Tang'' has been recognized by critics as a landmark album in the movement.<ref name = "ProudFlesh"/> [[Allmusic]] indicates that [[Nas]]'s ''[[Illmatic]]'' (1994), [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]'s ''[[Ready to Die]]'' (1994), [[Mobb Deep]]'s ''[[The Infamous]]'' (1995), and [[Jay-Z]]'s ''[[Reasonable Doubt]]'' (1996) are among the records of this era that reflected the Wu-Tang Clan's influence.<ref name="Huey"/>

At the time of the album's release, mainstream hip hop was dominated by [[West Coast hip hop]]. ''Enter the Wu Tang'' (along with the critically acclaimed ''Illmatic'' and the commercial success of ''Ready to Die'') was able to shift the emphasis away from the melodious, [[synthesizer]]-driven [[G-funk]] and restore interest into the East Coast hip hop scene. According to one columnist, "When ''Enter the Wu-Tang: The 36 Chambers'' first graced the pages of rap lore in 1993, [[Dr. Dre]]'s funk-filled, West Coast gangster rap dominated the business. Though this initial dominance was difficult to overcome, Wu-Tang still managed to carve out a piece of rap history."<ref name="ProudFlesh">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.proudfleshjournal.com/issue3/yew.htm | title = Retrospect for Hip-Hop: A Golden Age on Record?

=== Hip hop production ===
[[RZA]]'s production on Wu-Tang Clan's debut album had a profound and significant influence on subsequent hip hop producers.<ref name = "BlackFilm"/> The distinctive sound of ''Enter the Wu-Tang'' has been credited for creating a blueprint for [[hardcore hip hop]] in the mid-1990s.<ref name="Huey"/> Blackfilm.com asserts that ''Enter the Wu-Tang'''s production formula "transformed the sound of underground rap into mainstream formula, and virtually changed the face of contemporary music as popsters once knew it."<ref name="BlackFilm">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.blackfilm.com/20040514/features/rza.shtml | title = Coffee and Cigarettes: An Interview with RZA at Blackfilm.com | work = | publisher = | accessdate = November 17, 2006 }}</ref> Many successful rap producers have admitted to the influence of RZA's beats on their own production efforts. [[9th Wonder]], a producer and former member of [[Little Brother (band)|Little Brother]], is one of many whose vocal sampling styles are inspired by RZA.<ref name="9thWonder">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://remixmag.com/artists/remix_little_feat/ | title = Little Feat: An Interview With 9th Wonder at RemixMag.com  | work = | publisher = | accessdate = November 7, 2006 }}</ref> The album's reliance on soul music samples was novel at the time, but 21st century producers such as [[The Alchemist (producer)|The Alchemist]], [[Kanye West]] and [[Just Blaze]] now rely on this technique.<ref name="Alchemist">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.superswell.com/samplelaw/quotes.html | title = Sampling Quotes at Superswell.com
 | work = | publisher = | accessdate = November 7, 2006 }}</ref> According to Allmusic, the production on two [[Mobb Deep]] albums, ''[[The Infamous]]'' and ''[[Hell on Earth (album)|Hell on Earth]]'' (1996), are "indebted" to RZA's early production with Wu-Tang Clan.<ref name="Theinfamous">{{cite web | last = Huey | first = Steve | url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:1c821vkozzua | title = The Infamous at Allmusic | work = | publisher = | accessdate = January 1, 2007 }}</ref><ref name="Hellonearth">{{cite web | last = Huey | first = Steve | url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:3n881vaozzua | title = Hell on Earth at Allmusic | work = | publisher = | accessdate = January 1, 2007 }}</ref>

The vocals from tracks on ''36 Chambers'' have been extensively sampled by other artists and producers. [[Raekwon]] and [[Inspectah Deck]]'s vocals from "C.R.E.A.M." have been sampled on [[Masta Ace]]'s "Maintain" and [[Reflection Eternal]]'s "Good Mourning", respectively. [[Common (rapper)|Common]]'s "Nuthin' to Do" samples vocals from [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] on "Protect Ya Neck". [[The Pharcyde]]'s "Devil Music" samples vocals from [[U-God]] on "Da Mystery of Chessboxin'".

=== Subsequent Wu-Tang work ===
Following ''Enter the Wu-Tang''{{'}}s success, the individual members of the group negotiated and signed solo contracts with a variety of different labels: [[Method Man]] signed with [[Def Jam]], Ol' Dirty Bastard with [[Elektra Records|Elektra]], [[GZA]] with [[Geffen Records]], and [[Ghostface Killah]] with [[Epic Records]]. This expansion across the music industry was an element of RZA's plan for industry-wide domination, wherein "All Wu releases are deemed to be 50 percent partnerships with Wu-Tang Productions and each Wu member with solo deal must contribute 20 percent of their earnings back to Wu-Tang Productions, a fund for all Wu members."<ref name="Exclaim"/>

On ''Enter the Wu-Tang''{{'}}s effect on the group and the music industry, the ''[[Milwaukee Journal]]''{{'}}s Aaron Justin-Szopinski wrote "The Wu showed us that a hip-hop group can control its own destiny in the tangled web of the industry. It owns publishing rights, controls its samples and has 90% influence over its career. And that control, that outlook for the future, is what makes it the best."<ref name="Milwaukee">Justin-Szopinski, Justin.
