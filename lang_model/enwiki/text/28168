'''John Piper''' was the mid-morning host on [[BBC Radio Solent]] throughout the [[1970s]].  His programme was called ''Piper's Tune''. The show had a huge following, and consisted of a mix of music, guests and the regular feature, "Give a Neighbour a Hand," in which listeners would offer advice to people who called in asking for help. In [[1979]], Piper left BBC Radio Solent to join Two Counties Radio in [[Bournemouth]], as the station's first Programme Controller.  He remained on the air until he retired to Spain with his wife, Dilys. Piper also served as mayor of his home town, [[Sitio de Calahonda]], near [[M<U+00E1>laga]], in the latter half of the [[1980s]]. Piper was also a journalist and naturalist who served in Special Operations during [[World War II]].
