'''Hurricane Hattie''' was the strongest and deadliest [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[1961 Atlantic hurricane season]], reaching a peak intensity equivalent to that of a [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category&nbsp;5&nbsp;hurricane]]. The ninth tropical storm and seventh hurricane and [[major hurricane]] of the season, Hattie originated from an area of [[Low-pressure area|low pressure]] that strengthened into a tropical storm over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October&nbsp;27. Moving generally northward, the storm quickly became a hurricane and later major hurricane the following day. Hattie then turned westward west of [[Jamaica]] and strengthened into a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane, with [[maximum sustained wind]]s of {{convert|160|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. It weakened to Category&nbsp;4 before making [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] south of [[Belize City]] on October&nbsp;31. The storm turned southwestward and weakened rapidly over the mountainous terrain of Central America, dissipating on November&nbsp;1.

Hattie first affected the southwestern Caribbean, where it produced hurricane-force winds and caused one death on [[Archipelago of San Andr<U+00E9>s, Providencia and Santa Catalina|San Andres Island]]. It was initially forecast to continue north and strike [[Cuba]], prompting evacuations on the island. While turning west, Hattie dropped heavy rainfall of up to {{convert|11.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} on [[Grand Cayman]]. The country of [[Belize]], at the time known as [[British Honduras]], sustained the worst damage from the hurricane.{{#tag:ref|[[British Honduras]], formerly a [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]], attained its independence in 1981, becoming the country of Belize.<ref>{{cite web|date=2012-08-02|title=Belize country profile|agency=BBC News|accessdate=2013-01-13|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1211472.stm|series=[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/country_profiles/default.stm BBC Country Profiles]}}</ref> The region is referred as British Honduras in the article.|group="nb"}} The former capital, Belize City, was buffeted by strong winds and flooded by a powerful [[storm surge]]. The territory governor estimated that 70%&nbsp;of the buildings in the city had been damaged, leaving more than 10,000&nbsp;people homeless. The destruction was so severe that the government had to relocate inland to a new city, [[Belmopan]]. Overall, Hattie caused about $60&nbsp;million in losses{{#tag:ref|All damage totals are in 1961 [[United States dollar]]s unless otherwise noted.|group="nb"}} and 307&nbsp;deaths in the territory. Although damage was heavier in Hattie than a [[1931 Belize hurricane|hurricane in 1931]] that killed 2,000&nbsp;people, the death toll from Hattie was less due to advanced warnings. Elsewhere in Central America, Hattie killed 11&nbsp;people in Guatemala and one in Honduras.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Hattie 1961 track.png|alt=The path of a tropical cyclone, as represented by colored dots, denoting the storm's intensity and position at six hour intervals. Starting slightly right of center, the track moves up, before turning left and then to the bottom-left corner of the map.}}
For several days toward the end of October 1961, a [[low-pressure area]] persisted in the western [[Caribbean Sea]], north of the [[Panama Canal Zone]].<ref name=tcr /> On October&nbsp;25, an upper-level [[anticyclone]] moved over the low; the next day, a [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] over the western Gulf of Mexico provided favorable [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] for the disturbance. At 0000&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on October&nbsp;27, a ship nearby reported southerly winds of 46&nbsp;mph (74&nbsp;km/h). Later that day, the airport on [[Archipelago of San Andr<U+00E9>s, Providencia and Santa Catalina|San Andres Island]] reported easterly winds of 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h). The two observations confirmed the presence of a closed wind circulation, centered about 70&nbsp;miles (110&nbsp;km) southeast of San Andres, or 155&nbsp;mi (250&nbsp;km) east of the Nicaraguan coast; as a result, the [[National Weather Service|Miami Weather Bureau]] began issuing advisories on the newly formed Tropical Storm Hattie.<ref name=mwr>{{cite journal|title=The Hurricane Season of 1961|journal=Monthly Weather Review|date=1962-03-01|year=1962|month=March|volume=90|issue=3|pages=107<U+2013>119|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1962)090<0107:THSO>2.0.CO;2|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/090/mwr-090-03-0107.pdf|accessdate=2009-04-13|author=Dunn, Gordon E.|publisher=American Meteorological Society}}</ref>

After being classified, Hattie moved steadily northward, passing very near or over San Andres Island. A station on the island recorded a pressure of {{convert|991|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} and sustained winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h), which indicated that Hattie had reached hurricane status.<ref name="mwr"/> Late on October&nbsp;28, a [[Hurricane Hunters]] flight encountered a much stronger hurricane, with winds of 125&nbsp;mph (200&nbsp;km/h) in a small area near the center. At the time, gale-force winds extended outward 140&nbsp;mi (225&nbsp;km) to the northeast and 70&nbsp;miles (115&nbsp;km) to the southwest.<ref name=tcr /> Early on October&nbsp;29, a trough extending from Nicaragua to Florida was expected to allow Hattie to continue northward, based on climatology for similar hurricanes.<ref name="mwr"/> Later that day, Hattie was forecast to be an imminent threat to the [[Cayman Islands]] and western Cuba.<ref name=tcr /> Around that time, a strengthening [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to the north turned the hurricane northwestward, which spared the [[Greater Antilles]] but increased the threat to [[Central America]].<ref name="mwr"/>

With the strengthening ridge to its north, Hattie began restrengthening after retaining the same intensity for about 24&nbsp;hours.<ref name="mwr"/><ref name="hurdat">{{cite report|date=2013|title=Atlantic hurricane best track (HURDAT)|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Hurricane Resarch Division|type=Database|accessdate=2013-04-25|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/newHURDAT2013.html}}</ref> Initially, forecasters at the Miami Weather Bureau predicted the storm to turn northward again. Late on October&nbsp;29, the center of the hurricane passed about 90&nbsp;miles (145&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Grand Cayman]], at which time the interaction between Hattie and the ridge to its north produced squally winds of around 30&nbsp;mph (50&nbsp;km/h) across Florida. Early on October&nbsp;30, the Hurricane Hunters confirmed the increase in intensity, reporting winds of 140&nbsp;mph (225&nbsp;km/h).<<ref name=tcr /> The storm's [[atmospheric pressure|minimum central pressure]] continued to drop throughout the day, reaching {{convert|924|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} by 1300&nbsp;UTC; a lower pressure of {{convert|920|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} was computed at 1700&nbsp;UTC that day, based on a flight-level reading from the Hurricane Hunters.<ref name="mwr"/> Hattie later curved toward the west-southwest, passing between the Cayman Islands and the [[Swan Islands, Honduras|Swan Islands]]. Late on October&nbsp;30, Hattie attained peak winds of 160&nbsp;mph (260&nbsp;km/h) about 190&nbsp;mi (310&nbsp;km) east of the border of Mexico and [[British Honduras]]. This made Hattie the equivalence of a [[List of Atlantic Category 5 hurricanes|Category&nbsp;5]] hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]], making it the latest hurricane on record to reach the status until a [[Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project|reanalysis]] of the [[1932 Atlantic hurricane season|1932&nbsp;season]] revealed that [[1932 Cuba hurricane|Hurricane Fourteen]] reach a similar intensity on November 5, six days after Hattie.<ref name="hurdat"/> Additionally, Hattie was the strongest measured October hurricane in the northwest Caribbean until [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite report|author=Guiney, John L.|author2=Lawrence, Miles B.|date=1999-01-28|title=Hurricane Mitch: 22 October<U+2013>05 November 1998|type=Preliminary Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-05-01|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998mitch.html}}</ref>

Hattie maintained much of its intensity as it continued toward the coast of British Honduras. After moving through several small islands offshore, the hurricane made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] a short distance south of [[Belize City]] on October&nbsp;31, with an [[eye (cyclone)|eyewall]] of about 25&nbsp;miles (40&nbsp;km) in diameter.<ref name="mwr"/> Based on a post-season analysis, it was determined that Hattie had weakened to winds of 140&nbsp;mph (225&nbsp;km/h) before moving ashore.<ref name="hurdat"/> The hurricane deteriorated rapidly over land, dissipating on November&nbsp;1 as it moved into the mountains of [[Guatemala]]. During its dissipation, [[1961 Pacific hurricane season#Tropical Storm Simone|Tropical Storm Simone]] was developing off the Pacific coast of Guatemala.<ref name="mwr"/><ref name="hurdat"/> There was speculation that Hattie contributed to the development of Simone, and later [[1961 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Inga|Tropical Storm Inga]] after the remnants of Simone merged with nearby disturbed weather.<ref name="e15">{{cite book|chapter=E15: What tropical storms and hurricanes have moved from the Atlantic to the Northeast Pacific or Vice Versa?|type=FAQ|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/tcfaqHED.html|chapterurl=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/E15.html|date=2011-05-31|publisher=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|accessdate=2011-11-23|first1=Chris|last1=Landsea|first2=Stan|last2=Goldenberg| editor-first=Neal|editor-last=Dorst|version=4.5}}</ref>

==Preparations==
Upon initiating advisories on Hattie, the Miami Weather Bureau noted the potential for heavy rainfall and [[flash flood]]ing in the southwestern Caribbean. The advisories recommended for small ships to remain at harbor across the region.<ref name=tcr /> Initially, the hurricane was predicted to move near or through the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, and Cuba.<ref name="mwr"/> As a result, Cuban officials advised residents in low-lying areas to evacuate.<ref>{{cite news|title='Cane Hattie Threatens Western Cuba, Florida|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Palm Beach Post|page=1|volume=53|issue=223|location=Miami, Florida|date=1961-10-30|accessdate=2013-01-08|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W_4sAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8s4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1603,5681593&dq=hattie&hl=en}}</ref>

Hurricane Hattie first posed a threat to the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]] and British Honduras on October&nbsp;30 when it turned toward the area.<ref name=tcr /> Officials at the Miami Weather Bureau warned of the potential for high tides, strong winds, and torrential rainfall.

==Impact==
[[File:Belize topo.png|thumb|Topographic map of British Honduras|alt=Map showing the topography of then-British Honduras, with shades of green denoting lower elevations and browner, whiter shades showing higher elevations.]]
Despite predictions for heavy rainfall in the southwestern Caribbean, the hurricane's movement was more northerly than expected, resulting in less precipitation along the Central American coast than anticipated.<ref name=tcr /> In its early developmental stages, Hattie struck [[San Andr<U+00E9>s (island)|San Andr<U+00E9>s Island]], located offshore eastern [[Nicaragua]], with maximum sustained winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) and gusts of 104&nbsp;mph (167&nbsp;km/h). As the hurricane neared the island, the airport was closed due to tropical-storm-force winds.<ref name="mwr" /> Rough seas and winds damaged private property and two hotels. Many palm tree plantations were devastated. The schooner ''Admirar'', anchored in one of the island's bays, capsized during the storm.<ref name=PlanEmergencia>{{cite report|chapter=Analasis de vulnerabilidad|title=Plan de Emergencia Para La Atenci<U+00F3>n de Huracanes|url=http://www.sigpad.gov.co/sigpad/archivos/01_PLAN_DEPARTAMENTAL_SAN%20ANDRES_MAYO2011.pdf|publisher=Comit<U+00E9> Regional de Prevenci<U+00F3>n y Atenci<U+00F3>n de Desastres|accessdate=2013-05-11|language=Spanish|year=2008|format=PDF|page=[19]}}</ref> Overall, Hattie resulted in one death, fifteen injuries, and $300,000 in damage (1961&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]) in San Andr<U+00E9>s.<ref name="mwr"/> The hurricane was the fourth on record to strike the island, and of the four was the only to approach from the south.

In the northwestern Caribbean, Hattie passed close to Grand Cayman with heavy rainfall. At least 11.5&nbsp;inches (292&nbsp;mm) of rain were reported on the island, including 7.8&nbsp;inches (198&nbsp;mm) in six hours.<ref name=tcr /> Winds on Grand Cayman were below hurricane force, and only minor damage occurred due to the rain.<ref name="tcr"/>

The interaction between Hattie and the ridge of high pressure to its north produced sustained winds of 20&nbsp;mph (35&nbsp;km/h) across most of Florida, with a gust of 72&nbsp;mph (116&nbsp;km/h) reported at [[Hillsboro Inlet Light]]; the winds caused some [[beach erosion]] in the state.<ref name=tcr /> The U.S. Weather Bureau issued a small craft warning for the west and east Florida coastlines, as well as northward to [[Brunswick, Georgia]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Miami News|date=1961-10-28|title=Full-Fledged Hattie Kicking Up a Fuss|page=1A|accessdate=2011-12-12|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tyUzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5ugFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4755,6599568&dq=hurricane+hattie&hl=en}}</ref>

Later, Hattie impacted various countries in Central America with flash floods, causing 11&nbsp;deaths in Guatemala and one fatality in Honduras.<ref name="mwr"/> The [[Swan Islands, Honduras|Swan Islands]] reported wind gusts just below hurricane force, resulting in minor damage and one injury.<ref name="tcr"/>
