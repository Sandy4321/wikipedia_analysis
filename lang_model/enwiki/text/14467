'''John Titus''' (August 12, 1812 &ndash; October 16, 1876) was an [[United States|American]] [[Attorneys in the United States|attorney]] and [[jurist]] who served as Chief Justice of the Supreme Courts of both [[Utah Territory|Utah]] and [[Arizona Territory]].

==Background==
Titus was born on August 12, 1812 to William and Mary (Torens) Titus in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania]].  In addition to a strict [[Fear of God (religion)|Fear of God]] instilled by his [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] parents, he was educated in the [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania|Doylestown]] public schools, [[Lane Theological Seminary]], and [[Washington College, Pennsylvania]] before graduating from a law course at [[Transylvania University]] in 1837.<ref name="Goff 52">{{cite book |last=Goff |first=John S. |title=Arizona Territorial Officials Volume I: The Supreme Court Justices 1863-1912 |publisher=Black Mountain Press|location=Cave Creek, Arizona |date=1975 | oclc = 1622668 |page=52}}</ref>

In 1840, Titus was [[admitted to the bar|admitted to the Pennsylvania bar]].

In addition to practicing law in Philadelphia, Titus argued several cases before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].<ref name="John Titus"/>  During the 1850s he had become involved with the [[Know Nothing Party]] and ran for the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, losing his bid by one vote.<ref name="Goff 53">{{cite book |last=Goff |first=John S. |title=Arizona Territorial Officials Volume I: The Supreme Court Justices 1863-1912 |publisher=Black Mountain Press|location=Cave Creek, Arizona |date=1975 | oclc = 1622668 |page=53}}</ref>  

== Utah Territory ==
By 1861 Titus was active in [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politics and had become a friend of [[United States Secretary of War]] [[Simon Cameron]].  He began lobbying for a government position and following passage of the [[Arizona Organic Act]] was nominated to become [[United States Attorney]] for the newly formed territory.  Following confirmation, Titus resigned before taking up the position and was shortly thereafter nominated to replace [[John F. Kinney]] as [[List of Utah Supreme Court Chief Justices|Chief Justice of the Utah Territorial Supreme Court]].  The newly appointed judge was commissioned on May 6, 1863.<ref name="John Titus"/>

While serving on the Utah bench, Titus followed a middle course between anti-Mormon interests and the [[LDS Church]].<ref name="Goff 53"/>  Family tradition claims that the judge told [[Brigham Young]], "I am on this Bench to see that justice is done; when the Mormons have justice on their side they will get it, and when the Gentiles have justice on their side, they will get it."<ref name="John Titus"/>  As a result of this outlook, Titus gained a reputation as an impartial and able justice.<ref>{{cite book |last=Beadle |first=John Hanson |title=Life in Utah; or, The mysteries and crimes of Mormonism |publisher=National Publishing Company|location=Philadelphia |date=1870 | oclc = 544755 |page=214|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NmovAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA214}}</ref>  When his term ended in January 1868, Titus returned to his private law practice in Philadelphia.<ref name="John Titus"/>

==Arizona Territory==
In early 1869, Titus again sought appointment to a Federal position.  Based upon the recommendation of [[Richard C. McCormick]], [[John N. Goodwin]], [[Coles Bashford]], and due to his being the only candidate for the position, Titus was nominated to replace [[Henry T. Backus]] as Associate Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court.  President [[Ulyses S. Grant]] making the nomination on March 15, 1869.<ref name="John Titus"/>

When Titus left for Arizona Territory he left his wife and family in Philadelphia.<ref name="John Titus"/>  The new judge arrived in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] two days after his October court session was scheduled to begin.  As per the rules in place at the time, the session was thus not held.<ref name="Goff 53"/>  In following years he would hold court twice per year with sessions beginning on the first Monday of both March and October.  Each session would begin with hearing of Federal cases.  After all Federal issues were resolved the court would then switch to hearing matters of Territorial law.  In addition to these two session, all the Territorial Supreme Court justices would meet in the capital once per year to act as an appeals court.<ref name="John Titus"/>

Titus was promoted to Chief Justice on April 18, 1870, replacing [[William F. Turner]].<ref name="Goff 53"/>  Initial speculation was that Titus would move to [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]] where the former chief justice had presided, but the new chief justice chose to remain in Tucson which was the territorial capital at the time.<ref name="John Titus"/>

Judge Titus generally conducted matters of the court in an efficient and professional manner.  There were however two notable exceptions.  The first began shortly after Titus' promotion to Chief Justice when [[Milton B. Duffield]], Arizona Territory's first United States Marshal, appeared before the court on an assault charge.<ref name="John Titus"/>  During the course of the proceedings, the judge ordered the defendant to surrender his pistol.   Duffield refused to disarm himself.  While the accused was brandishing his firearm, the prosecutor drew his gun, pressed it the former marshal's head and pulled the trigger.<ref name="Goff 54">{{cite book |last=Goff |first=John S. |title=Arizona Territorial Officials Volume I: The Supreme Court Justices 1863-1912 |publisher=Black Mountain Press|location=Cave Creek, Arizona |date=1975 | oclc = 1622668 |page=54}}</ref>  After the prosecutor's weapon failed to fire, Titus called for a recess.  When court resumed Duffield appeared unarmed but was outraged that Titus refused to consider charges against the prosecutor, ruling the attorney's actions would have been justified if his weapon had fired.<ref name="John Titus"/>  Following the incident, Duffield held a grudge against Titus and engaged in an unsuccessful but persistent effort to have the judge removed from office.<ref name="Goff 54"/>

The second unusual incident came during the [[Camp Grant massacre]]'s legal proceedings.<ref name="Goff 54"/>  Outrage at the April 1871 killing of over 80 Apaches peacefully encamped at the military camp near Tucson was felt as far away as [[Washington D.C.]], with Federal officials threatening to place the territory under [[martial law]] if the attackers were not [[Indictment|indicted]].  A [[grand jury]] was impaneled which returned indictments against 100 men.  The trail began on December 6, with both the defense and prosecution having agree to try one of the leaders, Sidney R. DeLong, and having his fate determine the guilt of the other defendants.<ref name="John Titus"/>  Titus was supportive of DeLong and used his discretion to help insure a not guilty verdict.<ref name="Goff 54"/>  The defense did not contest the claim that DeLong had participated in the attack, but instead dwelt on the history of Apache attacks that had occurred in southern Arizona Territory over the previous months.  When Titus gave his instructions to the jury, they included directions that "murderous intent" could not be proven if the defendants felt an "irresistible apprehension of danger to them or theirs from Apache attacks" or by "such a sense of intolerable suffering as impelled them in spite of themselves to make the attack . . .?"<ref name="John Titus"/>  Following the judge's instructions, the jury needed only nineteen minutes to acquit the defendants.<ref name="John Titus"/>

During his tenure, Titus made several rulings with long term impact.  The first came during the January 1872 appellate session with ''United States v. Certain Property and William Bichard & Co.'', 1 Arizona 31 (1872).  The case involved an instance where the United States government had confiscated property from the Birchard brother's trading post located near an [[Indian reservation]].<ref name="John Titus"/>   Titus' opinion determined the Federal government's ability to regulate commerce on the reservation did not extend to areas outside the reservation.<ref name="Goff 54"/>   A second important ruling came with ''Campbell v. Shivers'', 1 Arizona 161 (1874) which dealt with the judiciary's ability to set the time for court sessions.<ref name="Goff 54"/>  Titus ruled that a judge had the sole right to set the date, but a compromise was made where by the territorial legislature would choose a date which was then ratified by the courts.<ref name="John Titus"/> 

News that Titus was being replaced as Chief Justice by [[Edmund Francis Dunne]] arrived several days after the start of his March 1874 court session.<ref name="John Titus"/>  Titus left the bench following the completion of his four year term of office.<ref name="Appointment">{{Cite journal |last=Goff |first=John S. | title = The Appointment, Tenure and Removal of Territorial Judges: Arizona-A Case Study | journal = The American Journal of Legal History | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 211<U+2013>231 | publisher = Temple University | date = July 1968 | jstor = 844126 }}</ref>
==Later life==
After leaving the bench, Titus remained in Tucson were he returned to private practice and formed a partnership with [[L. C. Hughes]].  The influence of Hughes' Democratic politics caused concern for the predominately Republican territorial leadership when Titus was considered for reappointment following the removal of Chief Justice Dunne.  The former Chief Justice was not however renominated.<ref name="Goff 55">{{cite book |last=Goff |first=John S. |title=Arizona Territorial Officials Volume I: The Supreme Court Justices 1863-1912 |publisher=Black Mountain Press|location=Cave Creek, Arizona |date=1975 | oclc = 1622668 |page=55}}</ref>

Titus died from [[typhoid fever]] on October 16, 1876 in Tucson.  In addition to his funeral service, territorial courts held memorial services for the former Chief Justice during their next scheduled sessions.<ref name="John Titus"/>  His body was moved from its Tucson grave to [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania]]'s Presbyterian Churchyard a year-and-a-half later.<ref name="Goff 55"/>
