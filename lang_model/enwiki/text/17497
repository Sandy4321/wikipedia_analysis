'''North Cornwall''' is a [[county constituency]] represented in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].   It elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election.

== Boundaries ==
The constituency shares a similar area to that of the [[North Cornwall]] district, however it also extends into the [[Restormel]] district, and parts of the North Cornwall district also fall into the constituency of [[South East Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|South East Cornwall]].North Cornwall though one of the most rural seats in England, has traditionally because of its non-conformist religious leanings been a Liberal stronghold.
