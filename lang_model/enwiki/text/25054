'''New York State Route&nbsp;283''' ('''NY&nbsp;283''') was an east<U+2013>west [[state highway]] located within [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga County]] in the [[Southern Tier]] of [[New York]] in the United States. It ran along the south bank of the [[Susquehanna River]] from an intersection with [[New York State Route 282|NY&nbsp;282]] in the [[Nichols (village), New York|village of Nichols]] to a junction with [[New York State Route 17|NY&nbsp;17]] (now [[New York State Route 96|NY&nbsp;96]] and [[New York State Route 434|NY&nbsp;434]]) in the [[Owego (village), New York|village of Owego]]. The route was assigned as part of the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]] as a [[Pennsylvania]]<U+2013>Owego route. NY&nbsp;283 was truncated to Nichols in 1949 and eliminated entirely in 1970. Its former routing is now mostly maintained by Tioga County as part of several county routes.

==Route description==
NY&nbsp;283 began at an intersection with [[New York State Route 282|NY&nbsp;282]] in the [[Nichols (village), New York|village of Nichols]], located on the southern bank of the [[Susquehanna River]] in south-central [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga County]]. The route headed to the east as East River Drive, crossing over [[Wappasening Creek]] as it left the village limits. From here, the route took on a more northeasterly course, following the east side of a deep, rural valley surrounding the Susquehanna River. About {{convert|3|mi}} from Nichols, the highway entered the small [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of Lounsberry, located just south of NY&nbsp;283's junction with Stanton Hill Road ([[County Route 54 (Tioga County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;54]] or CR&nbsp;54). NY&nbsp;283 continued northeast from the community, closely following the riverbank and the south edge of the encompassing valley to the [[Owego (village), New York|village of Owego]]. The route served a mostly undeveloped area of the village before ending at a junction with [[New York State Route 17|NY&nbsp;17]] across the river from Owego's central business district.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Mobil]] |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]] |year=1965}}</ref><ref name="owego topo">{{cite map |url=http://gis.ny.gov/gisdata/quads/drg24/usgspreview/index.cfm?code=o42076a3 |title=Owego Quadrangle <U+2013> New York <U+2013> Tioga Co. |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |series=7.5 Minute Series (Topographic) |year=1969 |scale=1:24,000 |accessdate=December 27, 2012}}</ref>

==History==
NY&nbsp;283 was assigned as part of the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]], extending from the [[New York<U+2013>Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] southwest of the [[Nichols (village), New York|village of Nichols]] to [[New York State Route 17|NY&nbsp;17]] in the [[Owego (village), New York|village of Owego]]. The route also served the village of Nichols, through which it [[overlap (road)|overlap]]ped with [[New York State Route 282|NY&nbsp;282]].<ref name="1930map">{{cite map |url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/Statewide/Historic_OTMs/1930fr.pdf |title=Tourist Map of Pennsylvania |publisher=[[Pennsylvania Department of Highways]] |format=PDF |year=1930 |accessdate=December 27, 2012}}</ref> Although it was signed as a state route, the parts of NY&nbsp;283 that did not overlap NY&nbsp;282 were initially locally maintained.<ref>{{cite map |title=Official Map Showing State Highways and other important roads |year=1926 |publisher=[[State of New York Department of Public Works]] |cartography=Rand McNally and Company}}</ref> On January&nbsp;1, 1949, NY&nbsp;283 was truncated to begin at the east end of its overlap with NY&nbsp;282 in Nichols.<ref>{{cite news |title=Highway Route Designations Change Jan. 1 |newspaper=Evening Recorder |date=December 9, 1948 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |location=[[Amsterdam, New York|Amsterdam, NY]]|page=19}}</ref> The remaining route from Nichols to Owego was split into two segments in the late 1960s as part of the [[Southern Tier Expressway]]'s construction.

Most of NY&nbsp;283's former routing is now maintained by [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga County]] as part of several county routes.
