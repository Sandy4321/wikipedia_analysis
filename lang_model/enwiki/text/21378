'''''Whaam!''''' is a 1963 [[diptych]] painting by [[pop art]]ist [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. It follows the comic strip-based themes of some of his previous paintings and is part of a body of war-themed work created between 1962 and 1964. It is one of his two notable large war-themed paintings. It was purchased by the [[Tate Modern]] in 1966, after being exhibited at the [[Leo Castelli]] Gallery in 1963, and has remained in their collection since.

Although derived from [[comics]], Licntenstein made numerous alterations to the work creating two panels from one original which is the subject of significant critical commentary. He also altered the relative significance of the various subjects of the work, both graphical and narrative. It is widely regarded as one of his finest and most notable works.

==Background==
The painting is large in scale, measuring 4.0 x 1.7 m (13&nbsp;ft 4 in x 5&nbsp;ft 7 in).<ref name=Tate_Whaam/> It is considered to be among Lichtenstein's war images (another major one is ''[[As I Opened Fire]]'') that combine "brilliant color and narrative situation".<ref>{{cite book|author=Alloway|page=20|quote=Of the war images, Blam and Takka Takka (both of 1962) are particularly successful in their combination of brilliant color and narrative situation, but Live Ammo, Flatten...Sand Fleas, Whaam! and others reveal the same impetus.}}</ref> In 1965, he produced Explosions sculptures that depicted freestanding and relief forms of subjects such as his previous comic-based paintings of "catastrophic release of energy" such as ''Whaam!''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alloway|page=56|quote=In 1965 there was a group of Explosions, freestanding and in relief. The comics-derived image of the catasttrophic release of energy that he had painted earlier in such works as ''Whaam!'' and ''Varoom!'' is solidified in enameled steel.}}</ref>

According to the Lichtenstein Foundation website, ''Whaam!'' was part of Lichtenstein's second solo exhibition at Leo Castelli Gallery from September 28&mdash;October 24, 1963 that included ''[[Drowning Girl]]'', ''[[Baseball Manager]]'', ''[[In the Car]]'', ''[[Conversation (Roy Lichtenstein)|Conversation]]'', and ''[[Torpedo...Los!]]'', and the [[Tate Gallery]] purchased it in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/frames.htm|title=Chronology|accessdate=2012-05-09|publisher=Roy Lichtenstein Foundation}}</ref><ref name=RLOF4>{{cite book|editor=Bader|pages=2&ndash;4|chapter=Reviews 1962&ndash;64|author=Judd, Donald|quote=''Whaam!'', ''Torpedo...LOS!'', ''Conversation'', ''In the Car'' and ''I Don't Care, I'd Rather Sink'', are all broad and powerful paintings.

One of the earliest known examples of [[pop art]], ''Whaam!'' adapted a [[comic-book]] panel from a 1962 issue of [[DC Comics]]' ''[[All-American Men of War]]''.<ref name=Tate_Whaam>{{cite web

}}</ref> The issue was "Star Jockey", ''All-American Men of War'', no. 89 (January&ndash;February 1962), and the panels were by [[Irv Novick]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://image-duplicator.com/main.php?work_id=0137&year=1963&decade=60|title=1960s: Whaam!|accessdate=2012-05-23|publisher=Lichtenstein Foundation}}</ref><ref name=RLDW104>{{cite book|author=Waldman|page=104|chapter=War Comics, 1962&ndash;64|quote=He modeled ''Whaam!'' on a panel from "Star Jockey"..., making several alterations that might at first seem insignificant but are in fact rather substantial. In the comic-strip panel (fig. 92), the central element is the airplane on the left, which has just scored a major victory over the enemy aircraft. Although it conveys the impact of the explosion, it shows the enemy plane smaller, at a distance, dominated by the huge letters of the exclamation "WHAAM!" whereas in Lichtenstein's version , the conquering plane and the exploding plane are given equal prominence. The painting balances the good guys against the bad guys, and is a far more compelling image as a result.}}</ref> The painting depicts a fighter aircraft, the [[North American P-51 Mustang]], firing a rocket into an enemy plane, with a red-and-yellow explosion (in the source comic the aircraft is a [[North American F-86 Sabre]]). The cartoon style is heightened by the use of the [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] lettering ''"Whaam!"'' and the yellow-boxed caption with black lettering, ''"I pressed the fire control... and ahead of me rockets blazed through the sky..."''

Lichtenstein altered the source so that the exploding plane was more prominent than in the original relative to the dominant conquering plane, making the image more compelling.<ref name=RLDW104/> The prominent exclamation "WHAAM!" is the graphic equivalent of a [[sound effect]].<ref name=RLDW105>{{cite book|author=Waldman|page=105|chapter=War Comics, 1962&ndash;64|quote=The narrative balloon in the left-hand panel is relatively unobtrusive, as in the comic strip that inspired the painting, whereas the exclamation "WHAAM!," which Lichtenstein has turned into the visual equivalent of a sound effect, pentetrates the space of the painting through its overlapping letters and its superimposition over the image. The frondlike flames shooting out from the explosion are strictly ornamental, in contrast to the more straightforward, neutral image of the pilot and airplane, which carries the burden of the narrative.}}</ref> Although the exploding flames are dominant,<ref name=RLDW104b/> the pilot and the airplane are the narrative focus.<ref name=RLDW105/> 

Although the original source was one panel, Lichtenstein created two panels to reinforce the separation of action and result.<ref name=RLDW104b>{{cite book|author=Waldman|page=104|chapter=War Comics, 1962&ndash;64|quote=As Lichtenstein noted, he was interested in the fact that the images did note seem to relate compositionally to one another.  He enforced this idea by creating two separate but contiguous panels. In the left-hand panel, the airplane and pilot are the predominant forms, with the narrative-text balloon consigned to a relatively insignificant position at the top of the canvas, and the airplane is depicted at a sharp diagonal to create the impression of depth. The right-hand panel is subdivided in another way, with the exclamation and the exploding plane competing with the dominant shape of the flames; the explosion is shown head-on, centered, and aligned with the horizontal and vertical axes of the canvas, rather akin to the neutral placement of the image in the single-object paintings. These different lines of force serve to reinforce Lichtenstein's depiction of the event as two separate parts of a sequence: an action, and the result of that action.}}</ref> The left panel features a prominent plane with a [[text balloon]] that is somewhat cast aside. In the panel the angular depiction gives the plane depth.<ref name=RLDW104b/> Meanwhile, the right panel shows a plane head-on competing along with the exclamation for prominence among the flames of the explosion.<ref name=RLDW104b/> The two are clearly linked.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Coplans|page=39|quote=...''Whaam I'' (1963), on the other hand, is a diptych with a clearly linked pictorial narrative...}}</ref> The diptych is depicted with one panel containing the missile launch and the other its explosion, representing temporally distinct events.<ref>{{cite book|title=Art Since 1960|edition=second|publisher=[[Thames & Hudson]]|author=Archer, Michael|isbn=0-500-20351-2|chapter=The Real and its Objects|year=2002|page=25|quote=...a preoccupation with time and movement is evident in the rationale behind the multiple panels of Lichtenstein's ''Whaam!'' (1963), where the firing of the missile and its explosion are temporally distinct events,...}}</ref> Lichtenstein once commented on this piece in a July 10, 1967 letter: "I remember being concerned with the idea of doing two almost separate paintings having little hint of compositional connection, and each having slightly separate stylistic character. Of course there is the humorous connection of one panel shooting the other."<ref>{{cite book|editor=Coplans|page=164|quote=}}</ref>

==Reception==
Unlike some of Lichtenstein's other works such as ''Step-on-Can with Leg'' and ''Like New'' the multiple panels are not minor variations of a repetitive image.<ref>{{cite book|author=Waldman|page=104|chapter=War Comics, 1962&ndash;64|quote=Where the subjects in both ''Step-on-Can with Leg'' and ''Like New'' are essentially repetitive images with only minor changes, ''Whaam!'' is a painting composed of a a balanced asymmetry.}}</ref> There is critical analysis of this two discordant panels. In 1972, it was stated that "In the [[Tate Modern|Tate]]'s ''Whaam!'', 1963, the drama of color, shape, and texture contrasts could hardly be greater."<ref>{{cite book|editor=Coplans|page=161|quote=}}</ref> and that "...apparent bald incompatibility between component canvases is more clearly presented than anywhere else, especially in the contrast between the centralized explosion panel and the more irregular, more obviously truncated imagery in the panel containing an otherwise intact plane."<ref>{{cite book|editor=Coplans|pages=163<U+2013>164|quote=}}</ref>

''Whaam!'' presented "...limited, flat colors and hard, precise drawing," which produced "...a hard-edge subject painting that documents while it gently parodies the familar hero images of modern America."<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Modern Art|edition=third|page=458|chapter=Pop Art, Assemblage, and Europe's New Realism|publisher=[[Prentice Hall, Inc.]]/[[Harry N. Abrams, Inc.]]|author=Arnason, H. H.|year=1986|isbn=0-13-390360-5}}</ref> The grand scale and dramatic depiction make ''Whaam!'' a naturally historic pop art work. The planned brushstrokes are pop art's retort to Expressionism.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Modern Art: Painting <U+2022> Sculpture <U+2022> Architecture <U+2022> Photography|edition=fourth|publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams, Inc.]]|author=Arnason, H. H., Daniel Wheeler (revising author third edition), and Marla F. Prather (revising author, fourth edition)|isbn=0-8109-3439-6|chapter=Pop Art and Europe's New Realism|year=1998|pages=538<U+2013>540|quote=By virtue of its monumental scale (nearly fourteen feet across) and dramatic subject (one based on heroic images in the comics of World War II battles), ''Whaam!'' Becomes a kind of history painting for the Pop generation. The artist's depictions of giant, dripping brushstrokes, meticulously constructed and far from spontaneous, are a hilarious Pop riposte to the heroic individual gestures of the Abstract Expressionists (fig. 631).}}</ref> Along with ''[[As I Opened Fire]]'' (the other of his monumental war paintings), this is regarded as the culmination of the dramatic war-comic works of Lichtenstein.<ref>{{cite book|author=Waldman|page=95|chapter=War Comics, 1962&ndash;64|quote=''Blam'' anticipates the resounding drama of subsequent war-comics paintings, culminating in such monumental canvases as ''Whaam!'' (fig. 90), 1963, and ''As I Opened Fire'' (fig. 91), 1964.}}</ref> Compared with ''As I Opened Fire'', ''Whaam!'' is less abstract.<ref>{{cite book|author=Waldman|page=105|chapter=War Comics, 1962&ndash;64|quote=The greater fragmentation results in an image even more abstract than the one in ''Whaam!''}}</ref> ''Whaam!'' represented a Lichtenstein's 1963 expansion "into the 'epic' vein".<ref>{{cite book|title=An Illustrated History of Pop Art|author=Pierre, Jos<U+00E9>|publisher=Eyre Methuen|isbn=0-413-38370-9|page=91|year=1977|quote=And the year 1963 shows an expansion of the artist's style into the 'epic' vein exemplified in the celebrated ''Whaam!''...}}</ref>  This is an example of Lichtenstein's painstaking detailing of certain physical features of the aircraft's cockpit.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Bader|pages=123&ndash;24|chapter=Technology Envisioned: Lichtenstein's Monocularity|author=Lobel, Michael|quote=...''in Whaam!'' (1963) he took care to delineate&mdash;in the cockpit close to the pilot's profile&mdash;a raised rectangular silhouette that signifies the interruption of the control panel's upper edge by a gun sight like the ones describe here (in the painting's source that interruption is indicated barely, if at all).}}</ref> A November 1963 ''Art Magazine'' review stated that this was one of the "broad and powerful paintings" of the 1963 exhibition at Castelli's Gallery.<ref name=RLOF4/>
