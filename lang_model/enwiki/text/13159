The '''Place des Victoires''' is a circular ''place''<ref>''Place'', signifying a public space, does not bear the connotations of shape that ''[[public square]]'' carries in English.</ref> in [[Paris]], located a short distance northeast from the [[Palais Royal]] and straddling the border between the [[1st arrondissement of Paris|1st]] and the [[2nd arrondissement of Paris|2nd arrondissements]]. The Place des Victoires is at the confluence of six streets: [[Rue de la Feuillade]], [[Rue Vide Gousset]], [[Rue d'Aboukir]], [[Rue <U+00C9>tienne Marcel]], [[Rue Croix des Petits Champs]], and [[Rue Catinat]].

==History==
At the center of the Place des Victoires is an [[Equestrian sculpture|equestrian monument]] in honor of King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]],<ref name=rough>{{cite book|last=Blackmore|first=Ruth|title=The Rough Guide to Paris|year=2012|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1405386959|pages=71}}</ref> celebrating the  [[Treaties of Nijmegen]] concluded in 1678-79. A [[marshal of France]], [[Fran<U+00E7>ois de La Feuillade|Fran<U+00E7>ois de la Feuillade, vicomte d'Aubusson]], on his own speculative initiative, demolished the old private mansions on the site. Feuillade's project was soon taken over by the [[B<U+00E2>timents du Roi]], a department attached to the king's household, and the royal architect, [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]], was entrusted with redesigning a grander complex of buildings, still in the form of a ring of private houses, to accommodate a majestic statue of the triumphant king.

===Mansart's conception===
Mansart's design, of 1685, articulated the square's unified fa<U+00E7>ades according to a formula utilised in some Parisian ''[[h<U+00F4>tel particulier|h<U+00F4>tels particuliers]]'',  (palatial private homes). Mansart chose colossal pilasters linking two floors, standing on a high arcaded base with [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]] of the pilasters; the fa<U+00E7>ades were capped with sloping slate "[[mansard roof]]s", punctuated by dormer windows.<ref>Rochelle Ziskin, "The Place de Nos Conqu<U+00EA>tes and the Unraveling of the Myth of Louis XIV" ''The Art Bulletin'' '''76'''.1 (March 1994:147-162) p. 152, note 23; illus. 155 fig. 11.</ref> However, because the building work was incomplete at the time of the unveiling of the monument, the envisioned fa<U+00E7>ades were painted on canvas.<ref>Ziskin 1994:154, note.</ref> By 1692, the Place des Victoires was pierced by six streets, and the circular plan functioned as a flexible joint to harmonize their various axes.

===The Desjardins sculpture===
The original statue, of Louis XIV crowned by Fame and trampling the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] underfoot, in [[Ormolu|gilt bronze]], stood on a high square pedestal with [[bas-relief]] panels and effusively flattering inscriptions; dejected bronze figures were seated at the corners. The sculptor was [[Martin Desjardins]],<ref>An engraving of Desjardins' monument is illustrated in Ziskin 1994:56 fig. 12.</ref> part of the team that was working cooperatively at the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau of Versailles]] and [[Gardens of Versailles|its gardens]].

===Louis XIV's reversals===
Louis permanently abandoned Paris in 1682, and his imperial ambitions in Europe were deflated by subsequent wars; the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] of 1697 was termed "a humiliating disaster for the king" by the military architect [[Vauban]].<ref>Quoted in J. Wolf, ''Louis XIV'' (New York) 1968:487.</ref> "During the course of the eighteenth century," Rochelle Ziskin has noted, "critics would suggest that the arrogance of representation at the Place des Victoires had serious political consequences and may have been a factor in provoking war." The grandiose memorial that had begun to embarrass Louis XIV himself<ref>In a memorandum of 1699, permitting the installation of an equestrian statue in Paris, Louis' secretary specified the king's desire for a plain pedestal, "nothing, in a word, that resembles the reliefs, slaves and inscriptions of the Place des Victoires" (quoted in Ziskin1994:161 and note 51.</ref> would eventually be destroyed in 1792, during the [[French Revolution]].

===Modern times===
In 1793, the Place was renamed ''Place des Victoires-Nationaux'' (National Victories Square), and a wooden pyramid was erected on the site of the destroyed statue. In 1810, under the rule of [[Napoleon I of France|Napol<U+00E9>on Bonaparte]], a nude statue of the General [[Louis Desaix]] replaced the pyramid. However, following the abdication of Napol<U+00E9>on, the statue was taken down and its metal was used to create a new statue of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] on the nearby [[Pont Neuf]]. 

In 1828, the restored Bourbon king, [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], commissioned the current equestrian statue, which was sculpted by [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Joseph Bosio]]. Louis XIV, dressed as a Roman emperor, sits on a proud horse rearing on its hind legs. An iron fence encircles the twelve-meter-high statue.
