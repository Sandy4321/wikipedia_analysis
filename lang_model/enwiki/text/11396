They head to Guthrie, Oklahoma, and Sam is able to stop the murder, although the man still ends up killing himself. The brothers later locate Andy, and learn that he has mind-control abilities. They believe that Andy forced the man to commit suicide. However, Sam has another vision of a woman's suicide, and it comes to pass while they are talking to Andy, exonerating him. After learning that Andy was adopted and that the woman who killed herself is his biological mother, they conduct research and discover that he has a twin brother named Ansen ([[Elias Toufexis]]) that he never knew about. Ansen has been using the same ability out of anger to kill those connected to the adoption that separated them. He then targets Andy's ex-girlfriend, and the Winchesters rush to save her. However, Andy ends up killing his twin to save Dean, making Sam realize that every child connected to Azazel seems to end up becoming a killer. After they later return to the Roadhouse, Ash reveals that Ansem's adoptive mother did not die when he was an infant, meaning not every psychic child follows a traceable pattern.

 |ShortSummary=Sam and Dean investigate a series of robbery-suicides in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that involve employees stealing from their employers and then killing themselves. A former security guard named Ronald "Ron" Reznick ([[Chris Gauthier]]) has been conducting his own research, and believes the culprit is a "mandroid"&mdash;half man, half machine. With his findings, the brothers instead realize that a shapeshifter is behind it all. Predicting that the next incident will occur at a bank, Sam and Dean pose as security workers to infiltrate the building, and eventually discover that the shapeshifter has taken the form of the bank's manager. However, before they can act, Ron arrives and takes everyone hostage. The brothers convince him that they believe his theory, and move everyone into the vault so that they can locate the shapeshifter. It has already morphed into another person, and when they discover its identity, it runs. Ron gives chase, but is then killed by a police sniper when he goes in front of a window. A hostage then has a heart attack, and Dean takes him to an ambulance outside the bank. He is identified, and FBI agent Victor Henriksen ([[Charles Malik Whitfield]]) is called in. Henriksen reveals to Dean that he has been tracking him since the incident in St. Louis the previous year, when another shapeshifter framed Dean for attempted murder.

 |ShortSummary=When the brothers investigate murders in which the culprits claim to have been ordered to do so by an angel, they find that the victims were a killer and a pedophile, and that both attended the same church. Sam and Dean then learn that a priest was shot to death outside the church. While Sam wants to believe that it really is an angel, Dean thinks it is the vengeful spirit of the priest. Sam is later visited by the angel, who orders him to kill an evil man. While Dean tracks the angel's target to make sure that the man does not do anything bad, Sam summons the spirit of the priest ([[David Monahan]]). The spirit believes himself to be an angel, but another priest ([[Denis Arndt]]) at the church convinces him otherwise and puts his soul to rest. Meanwhile, Dean prevents the man from attacking a woman, and then chases after him in his car. During the pursuit, the man almost crashes into a truck, and a metal pipe on the truck falls and impales him, which Dean believes may have been God's doing.

 |ShortSummary=As Molly McNamara ([[Tricia Helfer]]) and her husband drive along a highway, a man suddenly appears in the road. They crash in an attempt to avoid him, and Molly later wakes up alone in the car. The man reappears and chases after her, but Molly flags down a car driven by the Winchesters. She tries to show them the wreck, but the car has disappeared. While later driving to the police, they are confronted again by the man, but Dean drives through him, causing the ghost to dissipate. The brothers reveal that what has been chasing her is the vengeful spirit of Jonah Greely ([[Winston Rekert]]), who died on that roadway years earlier and now kills drivers on the anniversary of his death. The trio locates Greely's nearby home, and, after digging up his corpse, salts and burns the body. With the ghost of Greely gone, the Winchesters explain to Molly that her husband is still alive, but is now married to someone else. Molly&mdash;having died in the same car accident that killed Greely&mdash;is a spirit that has been reliving the same night since her death. Accepting the truth, she moves on.

 |ShortSummary=After a stagehand is apparently killed by a spirit on the set of a horror film, Sam and Dean head to Los Angeles to investigate. They learn that it was only a publicity stunt, but a studio executive ([[Gary Cole]]) soon dies at the hands of a ghostly woman&mdash;a young actress who committed suicide in the 1920s after being seduced and then fired by a studio executive. Though the brothers salt and burn her remains, another producer is killed. Sam then notices that the Latin in the film's script is an actual summoning ritual. The writer, Martin Flagg ([[Michael B. Silver]]), tells them that the rituals are from the original script written by production assistant Walter Dixon ([[Benjamin Ratner]]). They confront Walter, who admits that he has been summoning spirits to get revenge against the people he believes ruined his script. He destroys the talisman used in the rituals, but the now free spirits kill him for what he did.

 |ShortSummary=Following a tip from their father's marine buddy Deacon, Sam and Dean purposefully get themselves arrested to investigate a string of murders in a recently reopened cell block. However, FBI agent Henriksen shows up and attempts to [[extradite]] them. Their public defender, Mara Daniels (Bridget White), believes that they may have been falsely accused of many crimes, but says that they can only stall extradition for a week. To create a distraction to allow for Sam to follow a lead, Dean later gets into a fight with a fellow prisoner. However, the spirit of a nurse attacks Dean in the infirmary. He defends himself with salt, but she kills the other prisoner. Research reveals that it is Nurse Glockner, who used to kill infirmary patients and was later killed in a riot. Dean convinces Mara to locate where Glockner was buried, and the brothers decide to follow their escape plan. After getting into a fight with one another, they are taken away by a guard ([[Garwin Sanford]])&mdash;Deacon. He helps them to escape. When Henriksen learns that Mara supplied the Winchesters with information, he forces her to tell him where she sent them. As the brothers dig up Glockner's body and then salt and burn her remains, the FBI arrive at the wrong cemetery, having been lied to by Mara.

 |ShortSummary=Dean is attacked by a [[Genie|djinn]], and suddenly finds himself in a world in which his mother had never been killed by Azazel. He and Sam were not brought up as hunters, and thus are no longer close. Although Dean enjoys his new life, a ghostly young woman seems to be haunting him. When he realizes that all the people that he and Sam had saved as hunters are now dead, he decides that he must give up his new-found happiness to save them. Though Sam does not believe him, he accompanies his brother to the djinn's lair. There Dean discovers that the young woman he has been seeing is a victim of the creature. Noticing that she is alive but hallucinating&mdash;a way for the djinn to keep its victims captive while it feeds&mdash;Dean realizes that he, too, is within a illusory world. Dean forces himself awake as Sam rescues him in the real world, and kills the attacking djinn.

 |ShortSummary=Sam is abducted by Azazel and taken to an abandoned town. Also placed there are Azazel's other psychic children&mdash;Andy Gallagher and Ava Wilson, as well as newcomers Lily ([[Jessica Harmon]]) and Jake Talley ([[Aldis Hodge]]). As Dean and Bobby head to the Roadhouse for help and find it burned to the ground with the body of Ash buried in the wreckage, Andy uses his mind-control abilities to send Dean his location telepathically. That night, Sam is visited in a dream by Azazel, who explains that he has brought them together so that they can fight to the death, with the sole survivor becoming the leader of his army of demons. He also reveals why he killed Sam's girlfriend Jessica, and shows Sam the source of the psychic children's abilities&mdash;his own demon blood. Meanwhile, Ava uses a new demon-controlling ability, and forces an [[Acheri]] demon to kill Lily and Andy. She then reveals to Sam that she has been in the town since she went missing, killing off other psychic children that Azazel has sent there. She sets the Acheri demon on him, but Jake sneaks up behind her and uses his superhuman strength to break her neck, causing the demon to flee. Jake attacks Sam out of distrust, but Sam gains the upper hand and apparently knocks him unconscious. However, as Sam is distracted by an arriving Dean and Bobby, Jake regains consciousness and fatally stabs him.

 |ShortSummary=Dean sells his soul to a [[Characters of Supernatural#Crossroads Demon|Crossroads Demon]] ([[Ona Grauer]]) in exchange for Sam's resurrection, and is given only one year before collection is due. Ellen later arrives at Bobby's home, and gives them a map of Wyoming that Ash had left in the Roadhouse's safe. Research reveals that [[Samuel Colt]]&mdash;creator the Colt gun&mdash;created a giant devil's trap using railway lines. At the trap's center is an old cowboy cemetery, which Azazel forces Jake to go to. The hunters are there to meet him, but Jake subdues them long enough to use the Colt as a key to open a mausoleum. Sam then shoots Jake in the back, and finishes him off with multiple shots as he begs for mercy. As the mausoleum doors begin to open, they realize that it is a Devil's Gate&mdash;a doorway to Hell. A rush of demons escape and break the iron railway lines of the devil's trap, allowing Azazel to enter. As Ellen and Bobby try to close the gateway, Sam and Dean take the Colt to confront Azazel. Unfortunately, the demon catches them by surprise and takes the gun. He taunts Dean's demonic pact and questions if what came back was "one hundred percent pure Sam". Azazel prepares to kill them, but the escaped spirit of John grabs him. This distraction allows Dean to take back the Colt and shoot the demon in the heart, finally killing him. As Bobby and Ellen manage to close the gates, John's spirit moves on.

==Production==
===Casting===
While developing the second season, the writers expanded on the concept of hunters, resulting in the introduction of many recurring characters, mainly through the hunter-frequented saloon Harvelle's Roadhouse.<ref name="hunterflesh">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/supernaturals-creator-shares-38379.aspx |title=Supernatural's Creator Shares More Season 2 Secrets |date=October 19, 2006 |publisher=''TV Guide'' | first= Angel | last= Cohn |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}</ref> To complement the father-son relationship of the Winchesters in the first year, the writers created [[Ellen Harvelle]] and her daughter [[Jo Harvelle|Jo]].<ref name="p15">Knight, p.15</ref> [[Samantha Ferris]] portrayed Ellen, proprietor of the Roadhouse, and an old friend of [[John Winchester (Supernatural)|John Winchester]]. Ferris believes she was exactly what they were looking for: a "tough, strong, yet a little maternal actor."<ref name="p134">Knight, p.134</ref> [[Alona Tal]] played Jo, an intended love interest for Dean. However, she was eventually phased out, as she came off as more of a sister figure.<ref name="p15"/> The genius [[Characters of Supernatural#Ash|Ash]] was portrayed by [[Chad Lindberg]], who uses his vast computer skills to track the paranormal. Because the writers felt his "comical" and "wacky" personality was too unrealistic for the show, he was also removed by the finale.<ref name="p16">Knight, p.16</ref>

[[File:Amber Benson.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A smiling woman with long brown hair.|[[Amber Benson]], best known for her role of the witch [[Tara Maclay]] on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', was specifically chosen to portray the vampire Lenore in "Bloodlust".<ref>{{Citation | last = Bernstein | first = Abbie | title = The Lady is a Vamp | date = June, 2008 | year = | periodical = Supernatural Magazine | publisher = [[Titan Magazines]] | issue = 4 | pages = p.20}}</ref>]]
Other characters returned from the first year. Actor [[Jim Beaver]], who appeared in the first-season finale, made multiple appearances as hunter [[Bobby Singer]], an old family friend of the Winchesters. Beaver had expected his first-season guest appearance to be a "one-shot deal," and was surprised when he was asked to return.<ref>Knight, p.136</ref> [[Adrianne Palicki]] reprised her role as Sam's deceased girlfriend [[Characters of Supernatural#Jessica Lee Moore|Jessica]], in the alternate-reality episode, "What Is and What Should Never Be," as did Samantha Smith as [[Mary Winchester]]. Smith also made an appearance in a flashback in the penultimate episode, "All Hell Breaks Loose, Part One." And though at first reluctant because of his role on ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] returned as [[John Winchester (Supernatural)|John Winchester]] in the season premiere and finale.<ref name="morganfate">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-04-20-morgan_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA |title=Jeffrey Dean Morgan awaits his fate |date=April 20, 2006 |publisher=''USA Today'' | first= William | last= Keck |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}</ref> However, the character dies in the premiere, because the writers worried his separation from his sons again would "split the show," by having him away "doing more interesting things than the boys are doing."<ref name="shiban">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/cult/a42692/supernatural-writer-john-shiban.html |title='Supernatural' writer John Shiban |date=February 15, 2007 |publisher=Digital Spy | first= Neil | last= Wilkes |accessdate=September 22, 2009}}</ref> As a demon, villain [[Azazel (Supernatural)|Azazel]] periodically switches hosts, and was first fully portrayed by Morgan in the first-season finale.

Many factors went into the casting decisions of the season's guest stars. [[Linda Blair]], famous for her role in the horror film ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', appeared in the episode "The Usual Suspects". Though a fan of the show, Blair had turned down a guest appearance in the first season because she did not want to return to horror, having spent years getting a "clean slate". The television series ''[[Extra (TV series)|Extra]]'' had aired a three-part profile on her acting career and work with animals. It attempted to find a series that would write a role for her as "an actor's piece", rather than a cameo. Kripke, a fan of ''The Exorcist'',<ref name="p51">Knight, p.51</ref> offered to write an episode specifically for her, and she was "really touched" when he listened to her request to leave out demons in the storyline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/linda-blair-exorcised-41210.aspx |title= Linda Blair: How I Exorcised Supernatural's Demons |publisher=''TV Guide'' |first = Angel | last= Cohn |date=November 9, 2006 |accessdate=November 26, 2009}}</ref> During [[Dubbing (filmmaking)#Automated dialogue replacement .2F post-sync|automated dialogue replacement]], Jensen Ackles added in a reference to ''The Exorcist'' with the statement, "I could really go for some pea soup."<ref>Knight, pp.52<U+2013>53</ref> 

The producers prefer to hire actors who are important to the series' fanbase, and this contributed to the decision to cast ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'''s [[Tricia Helfer]] in "Roadkill." This was the first episode to have the Winchesters as supporting characters, and Kripke felt "Tricia had the charisma to perform the leading role."<ref>Knight, pp.89<U+2013>90</ref> Kripke enjoyed [[Emmanuelle Vaugier]]'s work in television series such as ''[[Smallville]]'', and believed she was an "easy choice" for the large role of the soon-to-be werewolf, Madison, in "Heart." Director Kim Manners felt Vaugier brought to the character a vulnerability like that of [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] in ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'', which made viewers sympathetic.<ref>Knight, pp.92<U+2013>93</ref> Conspiracy-theorist Ronald of "Nightshifters," was envisioned by writer and consulting producer Ben Edlund as the unsympathetic "semi-drunk [[Randy Quaid]] from ''[[Independence Day (film)|Independence Day]]''." However, this changed with [[Chris Gauthier]]'s casting, and Edlund felt that Ronald turned out to be a "really cool" character fans would enjoy.<ref name="p71">Knight, p.71</ref> The producers considered [[Summer Glau]] for the role of the zombie Angela for "Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things," but could not accept due to scheduling conflicts.<ref name="p37">Knight, p.37</ref>

===Writing===
{{rquote|right|''As much as I love season one, we actually had a pretty formulaic structure. There'd be an obituary that would take the guys into a town, they'd do a little research, they'd have a skirmish with the monster, they'd meet a girl, they'd have a showdown with the monster, they'd learn something about themselves, and then they'd roll out of town again. Pretty much every episode had that structure. And we worried that the viewers would get bored with the show if we did that again for a whole other season.''|&mdash;Kripke on the decision to change the series formula.<ref name="p8"/>}}
When production of the second season started, Kripke wanted to avoid the [[Villain of the week|monster-of-the-week]] formula used in the first year. To accomplish this, the writers decided to include more "human themes," mainly "the things Sam and Dean are truly afraid of: death, grief, betrayal, etc."<ref name="p8">Knight, p.8</ref> To do this, they focused on situations such as the brothers dealing with their father's death and giving them the task of hunting down Azazel, the demon who killed him.<ref name="teamspirit">{{cite web|url=http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2007/5/27/tvnradio/17780155&sec=tvnradio |title= Team spirit |publisher=The Star Online |first= Mumtaj | last = Begum |date=May 27, 2007 |accessdate=November 26, 2009}}</ref> Morgan feels that the brothers' "inner turmoil" created by the death of his character made them more three-dimensional.<ref name="p11">Knight, p.11</ref> While Dean has trouble dealing with his father's death, Kripke wishes they had focused more on Sam's reaction. Instead, the episodes dealt more with Sam's fear of becoming evil, which Kripke regretted, as the writers never depicted the character doing anything bad.<ref>Knight, pp.11<U+2013>13</ref> Another main storyline of the season followed Sam and Dean as they track down the various [[Characters of Supernatural#Azazel.27s special children|psychic children]]&mdash;young adults, who, like Sam, were visited by Azazel as infants and given abilities.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tv.com/supernatural/show/30144/story/10682.html | title=TV.com Q&A: Supernatural creator Eric Kripke |accessdate=January 4, 2010 |publisher=[[TV.com]] |first= Tim | last= Surette |date= January 10, 2008}}</ref> Overall, Kripke found the mythology of the second season "dense" and "confusing," and instead favored the "unique and structurally interesting" self-enclosed episodes.<ref name="onfuton">{{cite web | url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/rant.aspx?id=20071004 | title=On the Futon with... "Supernatural" Creator Eric Kripke |accessdate=September 30, 2009 |publisher=The Futon Critic |first= Brian Ford | last= Sullivan |date= October 4, 2007}}</ref>

Some of the season's storylines originated from ideas the writers could not previously use. From the series' beginning, Kripke desired to feature an [[evil clown]], as he felt that "clowns in a context where they're not supposed to be are friggin' terrifying".<ref name="p26">Knight, p.26</ref> To fit with the series, they made the clown into the shapeshifting [[Rakshasa]] of [[Hindu mythology]]. Kripke believes the creature became "less satisfying" because of this decision, and wishes they had included more scenes with the clown.<ref name="p27">Knight, p.27</ref> Another element of folklore favored by Kripke was the [[Robert Johnson (musician)#Devil legend|story of Robert Johnson]], which was the focus of his first screenplay as a writer. He found the legend similar to ''Supernatural'', noting, "It's a piece of real life American history and folklore, it's an American horror story, it takes place on the dusty back roads of rural America, and it's got great music."<ref>Knight, pp.54<U+2013>55</ref> However, the lore takes place in the early 20th century, and prevented the inclusion of Sam and Dean. To circumvent this, writer Sera Gamble suggested Johnson's story be made into a subplot detailed in flashbacks, with the Crossroads Demon returning in the present to make more [[Deal with the Devil|deals]].<ref name="p55">Knight, p.55</ref> Gamble envisioned the demon's hellhound as being similar in appearance to a [[Rottweiler]], but Kripke felt it would "look stupid". It was instead made invisible, which Gamble believes makes them scarier.<ref>Knight, p.56</ref>

Before he entered the television industry, writer and consulting producer Ben Edlund had wanted to pen a [[metafiction]]al script dealing with television production, but decided against it because he did not have production knowledge.<ref>Knight, p.96</ref> He later returned to it for the episode "Hollywood Babylon". Edlund decided to have the production staff look like "goofballs", and made fun of ''Supernatural''{{'}}s production staff, the network, and the studio.<ref name="p97">Knight, p.97</ref> Executive producer [[Robert Singer]] is a golfer and usually practices golf swings while directing, so director Phil Sgriccia had actor [[Don Stark]]&mdash;who portrays a producer in the episode&mdash;perform the same action. Comments made by [[Gary Cole]]'s "studio suit" character were based on notes from the network and studio for ''Supernatural'' during both seasons of production.<ref name="p97"/> One scene features a character commenting on the "terrible script" of the film ''Boogeyman'', which was written by Kripke.<ref name="p98">Knight, p.98</ref>

<!-- [[Image:Croatoan.jpg|thumb|275px|left|alt=Black and white illustration of men finding the word "CROATOAN" carved into a tree.|The titular demon virus in "Croatoan" arose to explain the [[Roanoke Island#The First Colony|missing Roanoke Colony]]&mdash;"America's first ghost story".<ref>Knight, pp.60<U+2013>61</ref> With the emergence of the upcoming demon war against humanity, the writers reasoned that demons would realistically prepare by looking into biological weaponry.<ref name="p60">Knight, p.60</ref>]]-->
Other stories were developed from simple concepts. For example, the reformed-vampire episode "Bloodlust" was developed to suggest that all monsters should not be killed indiscriminately. The plot alluded to "racial issues", but not blatantly; rather, as Padalecki noted, they explored it in a "fun way".<ref name="p30">Knight, p.30</ref> The episode "The Usual Suspects" emerged from the writers' desire to keep the audience guessing.<ref name="p50">Knight, p.50</ref> Cathryn Humphris pitched a story with a ghost serving as a [[Death-warning|death omen]]<U+2014>warning people of future tragedy, rather than trying to kill them, unlike previous ghosts on the series. However, Humphris had trouble developing the script's outline. Kripke noted a part of the episode in which brothers are arrested and have to explain to police what had happened; this scenario ultimately became the framework of the episode, which begins with Sam and Dean being taken into custody.<ref name="p51">Knight, p.51</ref> The concept for "Tall Tales" originated as a "[[Argument|he said, he said]]" episode, in which the brothers would recount conflicting versions of the same storyline. The writers deliberated over the use of five or six monsters in trying to find one appropriate for the episode, but eventually settled on a [[trickster]] because it "can do everything [they] want it to".<ref name="p82">Knight, p.82</ref> Although the writers typically prefer to put their own spin on folklore, they decided in this case to remain faithful to the archetypal trickster mythos.<ref name="p87">Knight, p.87</ref> Because the season alluded to the possibility of Sam becoming bad, the writers wanted to portray how an evil Sam would behave and what Dean's reaction would be. One of the writers' first creative ideas of the season was depicted in the teaser of "Born Under a Bad Sign", in which a blood-covered Sam wakes up not remembering the past week of his life.<ref name="pp7879">Knight, pp.78<U+2013>79</ref> The plot, which "fell into place" during the writing process, included [[demonic possession]] to explain Sam's actions<U+2014>an event that resulted in the return of the vengeful Meg Masters demon.<ref name="pp7879"/>

After the plotlines were developed, major deviations sometimes occurred in the writing process. Like in the final version of the script, twins with mind-control abilities were the focus of Edlund's original pitch for the episode "Simon Said". However, the more powerful twin&mdash;kept secluded due to deformities&mdash;forced his brother to perceive himself as retarded. At the end of the episode, his brother ate him in retaliation. The story was eventually changed, and instead focused on questions such as "What do you do with power?".<ref name="p42">Knight, p.42</ref> Kripke felt that this fit greatly with the series' storyline, because Sam was uncomfortable with his developing abilities; the writers wanted to explore one of the psychic children&mdash;young adults visited by the demon Azazel as infants, gaining powers later in life&mdash;who took his ability as a gift.<ref name="p40">Knight, p.40</ref> "Folsom Prison Blues" stemmed from Kripke's desire to feature prison ghosts, and the initial plot had FBI Agent Henriksen finally capturing the brothers and sending them to prison. However, this caused a major complication: the writers would have to devise a way for Sam and Dean to escape in the end.<ref name="p100">Knight, p.100</ref> Writer John Shiban suggested that the brothers be arrested on purpose in order to work a job, with the prison's head guard being revealed as a family friend.<ref>Knight, pp.100<U+2013>101</ref>

The two-part finale "[[All Hell Breaks Loose (Supernatural)|All Hell Breaks Loose]]" brought many storylines to a close. The psychic children were killed off, as the writers felt the characters were not as interesting as demons and monsters.<ref name="DVD"/> The Roadhouse was destroyed due to Kripke's disliking of the concept; he felt it gave a home to the road show.<ref name="kripke">{{cite web

[[Principal photography]] took place in Vancouver, [[British Columbia]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=Nicholas|title=Supernatural: The Official Companion Season 1 |year=2007|publisher=Titan Books|isbn=1845765354 | page = 14}}</ref> The crew used two cameras simultaneously for each scene, which allowed for two different angles to be filmed of the same sequence.<ref name="DVDwhat"/> The series usually has a dark atmosphere, though production purposefully created a contrasting appearance for certain episodes. "Hollywood Babylon" details the filming of a fake horror movie, and the use of two filming styles helped make a distinction; scenes of the [[Story within a story#Film within a film|fake film]] used more saturated colors, while scenes for the actual episode were "down to reality".<ref name="p98"/> To depict the perfect world of "What Is and What Should Never Be", the usual shadows and "moody lighting" more made colorful and warm.<ref name="DVDwhat">{{cite video|people=Kripke, Eric |date=September 11, 2007|title=Supernatural season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "What Is and What Should Never Be"|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Brothers Video}}</ref>

Problems during production sometimes arose. For his scenes as the yellow-eyed demon [[Azazel (Supernatural)|Azazel]] throughout the season, [[Fredric Lehne]] was required to wear colored contact lenses, forcing him to act blind. The production crew placed sandbags on the floor to help him locate his marks. [[Lindsey McKeon]], who portrayed a Reaper briefly possessed by Azazel in "In My Time of Dying", also experienced the same problem. Her scene, in which she touches Ackles' forehead, took nine takes to film, as she kept missing.<ref name="p23">Knight, p.23</ref> Filming for "What Is and What Should Never Be" was interrupted in order to accommodate the busy [[Adrianne Palicki]]. Production shifted to the following episode after five days of filming, and resumed when Palicki became available for the final three days.<ref name="DVDwhat"/>

Because the series uses few standing sets, set designer Jerry Wanek often had to construct entirely new sets for each episode.<ref name="DVDwhat"/> Outside elements had an influence on some designs, with the bar in the hotel of "Playthings" being an homage to ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''.<ref name="p67">Knight, p.67</ref> A Wisconsin native, Wanek was able to incorporate personal items into the motel set for the Wisconsin-based episode "Nightshifter"; because [[polka]] is part of the state's culture, he used posters from his father's old polka band, as well as photos of his nephews and Wisconsin landmarks.<ref name="p71">Knight, p.71</ref> Due to "Tall Tales"'s atmosphere, that episode's motel was designed to be "over the top". Wanek noted, "They were in this really odd-looking motel that had crystal chandeliers and carved beds, turquoise stove and refrigerator, and this wonderful [[Periodization|period]] linoleum on the floor. I thought it really matched the tempo and emotion of the show."<ref name="p83">Knight, p.83</ref> At times, however, Wanek was able to reuse old sets. The loft set from "No Exit" was redesigned into an apartment for "Crossroad Blues",<ref name="p55"/> and the bar in "Born Under a Bad Sign" was a refurbished Roadhouse set.<ref name="p78">Knight, p.78</ref>

Not all scenes could take place in the studio, and some were instead shot [[Filming location|on location]]. The vault scenes in "Nightshifter" were filmed in an actual bank safe, as production would not have been able to construct one on set.<ref name="p72">Knight, p.72</ref> Outside shots were filmed in downtown Vancouver, forcing streets to be closed off.<ref name="p72"/> The crypt of "Houses of the Holy" was built underneath St. Andrew's-Wesley United Church, with plastic used to imitate sculpted stone.<ref name="p76">Knight, p.76</ref> [[Riverview Hospital (Coquitlam)|Riverview Hospital]]&mdash;used as a filming location in previous episodes&mdash;was used for the premiere "In My Time of Dying". It also functioned as a jail in "Folsom Prison Blues" due to, as Wanek describes, "the texture on the walls, the lack of any humanity in the design, and the materials used to build it..." However, the prison block was built on a sound stage.<ref name="p101">Knight, p.101</ref> The final scenes of "Simon Said" were filmed at [[Cleveland Dam]],<ref name="p40"/> and "[[All Hell Breaks Loose (Supernatural)|All Hell Breaks Loose, Part One]]" made use of a pre-existing set built for the Western television series ''[[Bordertown (TV series)|Bordertown]]''.<ref name="DVD"/> The climax of "Part Two" was originally to take place in an actual cemetery, but numerous issues forced production to film the scene in the studio.<ref name="ew">{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20039486,00.html|title=Feeling 'Supernatural'|last=Leigh|first=Karen|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|accessdate=February 23, 2008}}</ref>

===Music===
The mostly synthesized orchestral score of the season was composed by [[Christopher Lennertz]] and [[Jay Gruska]].<ref name="music">{{cite web|title=The Supernatural Music of Christopher Lennertz| work=  | publisher = Mania |date=July 27, 2006|url=http://www.mania.com/supernatural-music-christopher-lennertz_article_51827.html|accessdate=September 27, 2009}}</ref> The pair try to base the music on the visuals of each episode,<ref name="p147">Knight, p.147</ref> with about a third of each episode's score being newly written for the supernatural legend.<ref name="music"/> For example, when the werewolf's point of view is depicted in "Heart", Gruska tried to make the score predatorial.<ref name="Knight, p.94">Knight, p.94</ref> For "Roadkill"'s emotional ending, Lennertz used cello and piano to "[tug] at the heart strings" and "push the tears".<ref>Knight, p.91</ref> The music was supposed to "become part of the sinister wallpaper" in "In My Time of Dying". Thus, in the scene involving John Winchester selling his soul to Azazel, Gruska wrote the music as "dark and dank", but feels the viewer would only notice the music if it was removed from the scene.<ref>Knight, p.25</ref>

Other musical elements were based on aspects of the episode, and often used less conventional instruments. For "Simon Said"&mdash;featuring characters with the ability of mind-control&mdash;Gruska tried to make the score more "mind-trippy", opting to mainly use "synthy, spacey electronica pads" to give it a science-fiction sound.<ref name="Knight, p.43">Knight, p.43</ref> Toy-piano sounds were included in "Playthings" by Gruska to make the score more childlike.<ref>Knight, p.69</ref> Because of the [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] theme of "Crossroad Blues", Lennertz made sure to be specific to Johnson's style when writing the music for the opening scene. A [[blues]] guitarist was brought in, and played on a "beat-up old acoustic guitar". However, they added in dissonant notes to foreshadow the "grittiness to come".<ref>Knight, p.57</ref> Lennertz used organ, drums, bass, and guitar to have a "retro bluesy approach" for "Folsom Prison Blues", mimicking the style of film composer [[David Holmes (musician)|David Holmes]].<ref>Knight, p.103</ref> Likewise, he wanted the episode "Nightshifter" to have a "feature film feel", with the score ending up similar to ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]''.<ref name="Knight, p.73">Knight, p.73</ref> With [[Linda Blair]] of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' guest starring in "The Usual Suspects", Gruska used tubular bells as an homage to the film's score.<ref>Knight, p.53</ref>

In addition to the score, the series makes use of rock songs, with most being selected from Kripke's private collection.<ref>{{cite web|title=Supernatural Creator Eric Kripke Answers Fan Questions <U+2013> Part I|publisher=EclipseMagazine|date=April 23, 2008|url=http://eclipsemagazine.com/hollywood-insider/5626/|accessdate=September 27, 2009}}</ref> Among the many bands featured in the second season are [[AC/DC]], [[Lynrd Skynyrd]], and [[Boston (band)|Boston]]. Rock songs are also usually featured in "The Road So Far" montages at the beginning of select episodes that recap previous events. The premiere used [[Ted Nugent]]'s "[[Stranglehold (song)|Strangehold]]", and a "coming soon" sequence midway through the season was set to [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]]'s "[[Hair of the Dog]]". The finale recapped the entire season to [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]]' "[[Carry On Wayward Son]]". The second season also began the tradition of naming many episodes after classic rock songs, with Kripke preferring [[Led Zeppelin]] songs.<ref name="onfuton"/>

===Effects===
To depict the supernatural aspects of the show, the series makes use of visual, special, and make-up effects, as well as stuntwork. Beginning with the second season, visual effects became an in-house department.<ref name="Knight, p.73"/> Visual effects supervisor Ivan Hayden feels this improved the series, as a fixed budget allowed them to compensate for other scenes that lacked effects, such as in "Nightshifter". Wide shots of the bank's exterior&mdash;featuring closed-off streets, police, and SWAT helicopters&mdash;were accomplished with visual effects.<ref name="p72"/> The series' catchphrase&mdash;"Scary just got sexy"&mdash;was added to a billboard in the background.<ref name="p71"/> For the episode "Houses of the Holy", production did not want viewers to be able to determine that the "angel" was in actuality a priest. Thus, the shape engulfed in light was a girl wearing a skintight white leotard.<ref name="p76"/> At times, the visual effects used were subtle. Cockroaches were digitally inserted into the sewer scenes of "No Exit"; director Kim Manners did not ask for it, but thought the addition "made it really creepy".<ref>Knight, p.47</ref> The episode "Playthings" featured a scene of a man dying after falling down stairs. The department added blood flowing from underneath him, and also made his fingers twitch and his mouth open and close to create a more life-like appearance.<ref>Knight, p.68</ref>

The special effects and makeup departments are also important assets to production. Dean has an out-of-body experience in "In My Time of Dying", and some scenes feature him looking at his own body in a hospital bed. To forgo the use of visual effects, the special effects department sculpted a full gelatin face from Ackles, and applied it to a body double.<ref>Knight, p.24</ref> To depict a woman burning to death in the episode "Simon Said", the actress was sealed inside a full body silicone designed to look like her, and was doused with fire accelerant. She was required to breathe through a straw, as well as don underwear soaked in ice-cold fire-retardant gel.<ref name="Knight, p.43"/> Prior to "Heart", Kripke had not wanted to include werewolves in the series, as he felt that the budget would only allow for "a guy with fur glued to his face".<ref name="p93">Knight, p.93</ref> As he prefers to have monsters be able to walk among humans, production made the transformation subtle&mdash;the character's eyes change, and her canine teeth and fingernails grow.<ref name="p93"/> However, writer Sera Gamble believes that they "dropped the ball" in the design, feeling that the creature looked too similar to a vampire.<ref name="Knight, p.94"/>

==Reception==
''Supernatural'' had low ratings during its second season. Viewers consisted mainly of teenage girls, with the CW trying to attract more males.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07074/769489-237.stm |title=TV Preview: 'Supernatural' tries to come out of the shadows |first= Rob | last=Owen| date=March 15, 2007|publisher=''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette''|accessdate=September 14, 2009}}</ref> It ranked No. 216 [[Ranking|relative to the position]] of other [[prime time]] [[Network television#United States|network shows]].<ref name="s2ratings"/> With an average viewership of 3.14 million Americans,<ref name="s2ratings">{{cite web|url=http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=052207_07|title=Season Program Rankings|date=May 22, 2007|publisher=ABC Medianet|accessdate=September 14, 2009}}</ref> the show's future was in doubt at the season's end.<ref name="doubt">{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/tv/11918311.html|title=Supernatural ratings less than super|last=McFarland|first=Melanie |date=November 23, 2007|publisher= ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer''|accessdate=September 14, 2009}}</ref> Despite this, the series was renewed for a third season. According to Special Forces Soldier Master Sergeant Kevin Wise at a 2007 ''Supernatural'' convention, the DVDs most requested by armed forces personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan were the first two seasons of the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/supernatural/supernatural-stars-presented-w-13869.aspx |title= 'Supernatural' Stars Presented with Honorary Coin on Veteran's Day |publisher=BuddyTV |first= Lisa | last = Claustro |date=November 17, 2007 |accessdate=November 26, 2009}}</ref>

The second season of the series received mixed reviews from critics. Jim Kaz of [[IGN]] gave the season an 8/10. While at first hesitant of the series, believing it to be "another horror/sc-fi/occult hybrid currently igniting ratings", he found the "eerie and intricate storylines" to overcome the "initial impressions of [[Clearasil]] ads and [[Paris Hilton]] in ''[[House of Wax (2005 film)|House of Wax]]''". Praising the [[cliffhanger]]s and the brotherly chemistry between the lead actors, Kaz deemed ''Supernatural'' "one-helluva edge-of-your-seat, ball-burner of a series with a forceful script, excellent acting (said pretty boys included) and some fine special effects".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/825/825403p1.html |title= Supernatural Season 2 DVD Review |publisher=IGN |first= Jim| last= Kaz |date=October 5, 2007 |accessdate=November 26, 2009}}</ref> Maureen Ryan of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' thoroughly enjoyed the season, and "really, really liked" the Roadhouse. Not understanding why the Roadhouse was not used more throughout the season, she was "pretty annoyed" when it was destroyed. Ryan also favored the new hunter characters, especially Ash, and was "not thrilled" when Ash was killed. Regarding Sam and Dean, she noted the series' "ability to hone in on the brotherly conflicts and emotions threaded through a well-plotted monster-of-the-week story". While she enjoyed [[Tricia Helfer]]'s guest appearance, she did not enjoy the stuntcasting of [[Linda Blair]] and would have preferred a "more skilled actress".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/08/supernatural-jensen-jared-cw-season-5.html |title= Thoughts on 'Supernatural' and what you need to know before Season 5 begins  |publisher=''Chicago Tribune'' |first= Maureen | last= Ryan |date=August 19, 2009 |accessdate=December 31, 2009}}</ref> The season received a grade of a B- from Brian Tallerico of [[UGO]], who found it "frustrating" due to the use of the "same predictable formula" that did not meet the standards of the first season. Other problems he found included "the brothers [turning] whiny and mopey and [taking] everything too seriously". However, he believed that the season ended "strong"&mdash;he liked how the main storyline was wrapped up, opening new storylines&mdash;and noted that there were some "excellent" episodes. Tallerico praised the "tongue-in-cheek Winchester adventure" "The Usual Suspects", feeling that it had "enough pop culture references to make [[Quentin Tarantino|Tarantino]] jealous" and the "pitch-perfect mix of tones that make the show so great". He also found "Nightshifter" to be the "best action hour of ''Supernatural''{{'}}s second year", deeming it "riveting from beginning to end".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=17800 |title= Supernatural: Season Two DVD Review |publisher=UGO |first= Brian | last= Tallerico |date= |accessdate=November 26, 2009}}</ref> Also applauding the season's cliffhanger was Peter Brown of iFMagazine, who gave the season a B+. He enjoyed the expansion of the series' mythology, as well as the new characters introduced. Brown praised the "haunting music and sounds that really give a chilling feel to each and every episode", feeling them to be [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]-worthy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/review.asp?article=2025 |title= Review: Supernatural &mdash; The Complete Second Season |publisher=IFMagazine |first= Peter | last= Brown |accessdate=November 26, 2009 |date=October 10, 2007}}</ref>
