==History==

===Early years===

Government-funded public service radio in New Zealand was historically provided by the Radio Broadcasting Company between 1925 and 1931, the New Zealand Broadcasting Board between 1931 and 1936, the National Broadcasting Service between 1936 and 1962, the [[New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation]] between 1962 and 1975, and the Radio New Zealand [[state owned enterprise]] between 1975 and 1995.<ref>Day, Patrick. Voice and Vision: A History of Broadcasting in New Zealand. Vol. 2. Auckland University Press, 2000.</ref> The organisation placed a strong emphasis on training its staff in [[Received Pronunciation]], until it began promoting local and indigenous accents in the 1990s.<ref>Bell, Allan. "This Isn't the BBC: Colonialism in New Zealand English1." Applied Linguistics 3.3 (1982): 246-258.</ref><ref>Bell, Allan. "Leaving Home: De-europeanisation in a post-colonial variety of broadcast news language." Standard Languages and Language Standards in a Changing Europe. Oslo, Norway: Novus (2011): 177-198.</ref>

As part of the process of [[privatisation]] carried out by the [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|fourth National government]], the government's commercial radio operations were sold to private investors as [[The Radio Network]] and the government's non-commercial assets (known previously as New Zealand Public Radio) became the current Radio New Zealand Crown entity.<ref>[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=2457045251&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record={BCB0978D}&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC ''Radio New Zealand Act (No 2) 1995 (1995 No 53)'']</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=2457045251&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record={CBB7A71B}&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC |title=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=Legislation.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2010-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=2457045251&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record={BCB0978D}&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC |title=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=Legislation.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2010-06-09}}</ref>

===Later years===

The broadcaster is bound by the Charter and Operating Principles included in the Radio New Zealand Act, which is reviewed by the [[Parliament of New Zealand]] every five years and was amended in 2004. The broadcaster is required to provoke debate and critical thought, reflect New Zealand and M<U+0101>ori cultural diversity, cater for varied ages and interests, promote music and drama and create a sense of national identity. It must operate a news service, an international shortwave service and an archiving programme.

It must also produce and commission high quality programming based on research of public needs, and balance mass appeal and minority appeal programming. In achieving these objectives, it must be socially and financially responsible.<ref>[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1995/0052/latest/DLM368575.html?search=ta_act_R_ac%40ainf%40anif_an%40bn%40rn_25_a&p=1# ''Radio New Zealand Act 1995 (1995 No 52)'']</ref>

There is also a press gallery office in [[Beehive (building)|the Beehive]], and several international correspondents.

Before 1997, the Radio New Zealand News service provided news to most radio stations in New Zealand.<ref>Hope, Wayne. "New thoughts on the public sphere in Aotearoa New Zealand." Scooped: The politics and power of journalism in Aotearoa New Zealand (2012): 27-47.</ref><ref>Norris, Paul, and Margie Comrie. "Changes in radio news 1994-2004." The great New Zealand radio experiment (2005): 175-194.</ref> As of 2015, its primary output is via the Radio New Zealand website and hourly bulletins carried at various times by the National, International and Concert stations.

The news service is also responsible for most of Radio New Zealand National's schedule, including breakfast programme Morning Report, morning programme Nine to Noon, midday news programme Midday Report and drive programme Checkpoint. Morning Report includes half hourly bulletins, voice reports, interviews and correspondent crosses. There are also scheduled in-depth bulletins of rural, sports, business  and Te Manu Korihi M<U+0101>ori news, and news from around the [[Pacific]]. Midday Report consists entirely of specialist bulletins, while Checkpoint relies more heavily on reporters, correspondents and international [[BBC News]] and [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] reports.

===radionz.co.nz===

The Radio New Zealand website, radionz.co.nz, was launched in October 2005 and includes news coverage, programme information, online station streaming and podcasting. [[Radio New Zealand National]], [[Radio New Zealand Concert]], [[AM Network]] [[Parliament of New Zealand|Parliament]] coverage, and [[Radio New Zealand International]] are available as
[[Windows Media Audio]] streams. Almost all Radio New Zealand produced programmes (excepting some with music) are available back to Jan 2008, and have [[MP3]] and [[Ogg Vorbis]] and download and [[podcasts]] options. However, some material is not available due to insufficient [[copyright|copyright clearances]].

The website has been awarded the [[Qantas Media Award]] for Best Website Design in 2007, a [[New Zealand Open Source Award]] in 2008,<ref>{{Cite web | title =Previous Finalists and Winners - 2008 Winners | work =New Zealand Open Source Awards | publisher =New Zealand Open Source Society | url =http://www.nzosa.org.nz/winners | accessdate =3 May 2011 }}</ref> and New Zealand Radio Award for Best Radio Website in 2009. The site was re-launched on 26 May 2013 with a new design and a custom CMS built using the [[open source]] [[Ruby On Rails]] framework.

===The Wireless===
[[Image:The Wireless logo.png|thumb|right|The Wireless logo]]
In October 2013, Radio New Zealand launched the youth-focussed non-commercial website The Wireless. The website emerged from the push for a youth radio station as part of Radio New Zealand's offerings. Instead of creating a youth radio station, Radio New Zealand decided to create a website or online magazine that focused on 18- to 30-year-olds which would be more relevant to the demographic.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.listener.co.nz/commentary/the-internaut/the-wireless-youth-site-a-brave-step-into-the-net-for-radio-nz/ | title=The Wireless: youth site a brave step into the net for Radio NZ | work=New Zealand Listener | date=31 October 2013 | accessdate=24 July 2014 | author=Manhire, Toby}}</ref> Registration is optional, but is required for posting comments.

Project manager Marcus Stickley noted that: "Radio NZ has had the wisdom to recognize that it didn<U+2019>t necessarily need to be under the Radio NZ brand. It needed to develop something specifically for that audience, and they<U+2019>ve given us the freedom, to go away and figure out exactly how to do that."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thebigidea.co.nz/news/blogs/strange-news/135801-switching-on-the-wireless | title=Switching on The Wireless | work=The Big Idea | date=31 October 2013 | accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref> The CEO of Radio New Zealand commented in April 2014 that ''The Wireless'' is <U+201C>the most exciting innovation from RNZ in recent years.<U+201D><ref>{{cite news | url=http://salient.org.nz/news/broader-casting | title=Broader casting | work=Salient | date=13 April 2014 | accessdate=24 July 2014 | author=Hurley, Emma}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewireless.co.nz|title=Home - The Wireless|publisher=thewireless.co.nz|accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nzonair.govt.nz/digital/showcase/the-wireless/ Showcase of The Wireless] on the [[NZ On Air]] website</ref><ref>[http://publicaddress.net/speaker/about-radio-nzs-new-millennial-venture-the/ "About Radio NZ's new "millennial" venture, The Wireless"], guest post on Public Address</ref>
