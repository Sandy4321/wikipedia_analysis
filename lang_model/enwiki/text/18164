'''Brandi Denise Chastain''' (born July 21, 1968) is a professional [[United States|American]] [[association football|soccer]] [[defender (association football)|defender]] and [[midfielder]] who plays for the team [[California Storm]] of [[Women's Premier Soccer League]] and is a former member of the [[United States women's national soccer team]].

Chastain has played for [[San Jose CyberRays]] of the [[Women's United Soccer Association|WUSA]] and [[FC Gold Pride]] of [[Women's Professional Soccer]]. She is best known for her game-winning [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout kick]] against [[China women's national football team|China]] in the [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup]] final and her bra-baring celebration afterwards.

==Early playing career==
She attended [[Archbishop Mitty High School]] in [[San Jose, California]], helping take the team to three section championships. In 1986 Chastain was awarded the ''Soccer America Freshmen Player Of The Year'' award at the [[University of California-Berkeley]]. Soon after, she underwent reconstructive surgery on both knees which caused her to miss much of the 1987 and 1988 seasons. She transferred to [[Santa Clara University]] before the start of the 1989 season, leading them to two [[NCAA Women's Division I Soccerl Championship|Final Four]] [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] appearances, 1989 and 1990, before she graduated in 1991.

Chastain first represented her country on June 1, 1988, against [[Japan]]. She scored her first (through fifth) international goals on April 18, 1991 when she came off the bench as a forward to score five consecutive goals in a 12<U+2013>0 United States win in a [[CONCACAF]] [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] qualifier against [[Mexico]]. Team USA went on to win the World Cup, staged in [[People's Republic of China|China]]. 

After that first World Cup, she played club soccer for one season in [[L. League|Japan]] in 1993, earning team MVP honors and was the only foreigner to be selected as one of the league's top 11 players.<ref>http://www.nadeshikoleague.jp/fan_zone/data/pdf/005.pdf</ref>  

As a [[defender (football)|defender]], she made the U.S. National team again in 1996 and participated in the 1996 [[Atlanta Olympic Games]], helping the Americans win the gold medal by playing every minute of every U.S. game, despite a third serious knee injury suffered in the semifinal against [[Norway women's national football team|Norway]].<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.soccertimes.com/usteams/roster/women/chastain.htm soccer profile: Brandi Chastain]</ref> Of her 192 career [[Cap (sport)|caps]], she played 89 primarily at defender during which she occasionally played [[midfielder (football)|midfielder]].<ref name="autogenerated1" />

==Sports bra episode==
[[Image:Brandi Chastain 1999.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The 1999 sports bra incident.]]
On July 10, 1999 at the Women's World Cup at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California]], after scoring the fifth kick in the [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] to give the United States the win over [[China women's national football team|China]] in the final game, Chastain celebrated by spontaneously whipping off her jersey and falling to her knees in a [[sports bra]], her fists clenched.  This image was featured on the covers of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', and ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Chastain's take on the incident was "Momentary insanity, nothing more, nothing less. I wasn<U+2019>t thinking about anything. I thought, <U+2018>This is the greatest moment of my life on the soccer field.<U+2019>"<ref>[http://www.usoc.org/26_1206.htm United States Olympic Committee <U+2013> Chastain, Brandi]</ref>

==Professional career==
Chastain played on the [[San Jose CyberRays]] in the [[Women's United Soccer Association]] from its formation in 2001 until its suspension in 2003. She played on the [[United States women's national soccer team|US women's national team]] until her last game on 6 December 2004. 

She appeared on an episode of [[List of Jeopardy! tournaments and events#Celebrity Jeopardy!|Celebrity Jeopardy!]] on February 9, 2001, and won with $1. Her charity received $15,000. Host [[Alex Trebek]] alluded to the incident when he said, "I hope you win again."

She appeared in the [[HBO]] documentary ''[[Dare to Dream: The Story of the U.S. Women's Soccer Team]].''

Chastain's book about women's competitive sports is titled ''It<U+2019>s Not About the Bra''. (ISBN 978-0060765996)

She posed [[nude]] except for soccer cleats and a strategically placed soccer ball in the [[list of men's magazines|men's magazine]] ''[[Gear (magazine)|Gear]]''.<ref name="autogenerated1" />  Her appearance in the magazine created a controversy and the issue was brought up as a question at the Miss Teen USA pageant in 1999.

Chastain has been a [[color commentator]] on soccer telecasts on two networks. She broadcast for [[NBC Sports]] during the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics]].<ref>[http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/mediumwell/blog/2008/07/your_nbc_olympics_lineup.html Medium Well: Your NBC Olympics lineup <U+2013> A blog on sports media, news and networks <U+2013> baltimoresun.com]</ref> Her work with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[ESPN]] has included [[Major League Soccer]] matches and being part of a rotation of studio commentators for the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup]].<ref>[http://www.espnmediazone3.com/us/media-kits/2011-womens-world-cup/2011-womens-world-cup-commentators/ 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup Commentators <U+2013> ESPN MediaZone.]</ref>
