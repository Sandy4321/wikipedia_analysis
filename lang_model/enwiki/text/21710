'''''The Black Sleep''''' ([[1956 in film|1956]]), is an [[USA|American]] black-and-white [[science fiction film]], scripted by [[John C. Higgins]] from a story by [[Gerald Drayson Adams]] developed for [[film producer|producers]] [[Aubrey Schenck]] and [[Howard W. Koch]], who had a four-picture finance-for-distribution arrangement with [[United Artists]]. The film was re-released in 1962 as ''Dr. Cadman's Secret''. 

The [[film]] was [[film director|directed]] by [[Reginald LeBorg]] and included in its starring cast [[Bela Lugosi]] in his last true film role.  Also starred were [[Basil Rathbone]], [[Lon Chaney Jr.|Lon Chaney]], [[John Carradine]], and [[Akim Tamiroff]] in a role original written for [[Peter Lorre]].  In a "prominent" supporting role was [[Ed Wood]] regular [[Tor Johnson]].  

Set in early 19th-century England, the story concerned a prominent, knighted surgeon whose wife has fallen into a coma caused by a deep-seated [[brain tumor]]. Due to medicine's state of the art at the time, he does not know how to reach the tumor without risking brain damage or death to the woman he loves, so he undertakes to secretly experiment on the brains of living, but involuntary, human subjects who are under the influence of a powerful [[India|Indian]] anesthetic which he calls the "black sleep". Once he has finished his experiment, surviving subjects are revived and placed, in seriously degenerated and mutilated states, in a hidden cellar in the gloomy, abandoned country abbey where he conducts his experiments.

Produced during [[1955]], the film went into theaters in the early summer of 1956, just ahead of the TV syndication by [[Universal Pictures]] of its two decades of "monster movies" through [[Screen Gems]], under the package title of [[Shock Theater]].  It may or may not be coincidental that writer Higgins, director LeBorg, and stars Rathbone, Chaney, Carradine and Lugosi had all been significantly associated with Universal "horror films" or related [[b-film]]s.  It certainly recalls two "houseful of monster" films of Universal in the mid-40s, ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[House of Dracula]]'', only relying on a completely new cadre of human monsters.  

United Artists sent ''The Black Sleep'' out as the A-film as a [[double feature]] with ''[[The Quatermass Xperiment|The Creeping Unknown]]''.
