==Background==
Georges St-Pierre, a [[French Canadian]], was born on May 19, 1981 in [[Saint-Isidore, Mont<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>gie, Quebec|Saint-Isidore]], Quebec, to Roland and Pauline St-Pierre.<ref name="Trudel">{{cite web |url=http://www.lactualite.com/culture/georges-st-pierre-gentleman-gladiateur?page=0,4 |title=Georges St-Pierre, gentleman gladiateur  |work=Lactualite.com |date=December 6, 2010 |last=Trudel |first=Jonathan |accessdate=December 13, 2010}}</ref> St-Pierre had a difficult childhood, attending a school where others would steal his clothes and money.<ref name="Tousignant">{{cite web |url=http://www.hour.ca/news/news.aspx?iIDArticle=8504 |title=Georges St.-Pierre leads Montreal to UFC glory |work=Hour.ca |date=March 2, 2006 |last=Tousignant |first=Isa |accessdate=July 6, 2007}}</ref> He started learning [[Kyokushin|Kyokushin karate]] at age seven from his father and later from a Kyokushin Karate Master to defend himself against a school [[bullying|bully]].<ref name="knucklepit">{{cite web |url=http://www.knucklepit.com/mixed-martial-arts-georges_st.pierre.htm |title=Montreal's MMA Warrior. |work=Knucklepit.com |last=Wickert |first=Marc |accessdate=July 6, 2007}}</ref> He took up [[wrestling]] and [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] after his karate teacher died (at this point he also trained in [[boxing]]). Before turning pro as a mixed-martial artist, St-Pierre worked as a [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] at a [[Montreal]] night club in the [[South Shore (Montreal)|South Shore]] called Fuzzy Brossard and as a garbageman for six months to pay for his school fees.<ref name="Kelly">{{cite web |url=http://www.complex.com/CELEBRITIES/Web-Exclusive/Georges-St.-Pierre |title=Gold Rush |work=Complex.com |last=Kelly |first=Seth |accessdate=December 24, 2007}}</ref>

===Club affiliation===
St-Pierre has trained with a number of groups in a large variety of gyms throughout his fighting career. Prior to his fight with [[B.J. Penn]] at [[UFC 58]], he trained at the [[Renzo Gracie]] Jiu-Jitsu Academy in New York City. St-Pierre received his brown belt in [[BJJ]] from Renzo Gracie on July 21, 2006.<ref name="brownbelt">{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/OtherSports/2006/07/22/1697789-sun.html |work=Slam.canoe.ca |first=Jose |last=Rodriguez |publisher=Calgary Sun |title=Fighter has big plans}}</ref> In September 2008, St-Pierre earned his black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu under Bruno Fernandes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=news.detail&gid=15016 |title=Zuffa Fighters get Belted |last=Gerbasi |first=Thomas |date=October 13, 2008 |work=UFC.com |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref>

St-Pierre began training with [[Rashad Evans]], [[Nathan Marquardt]], [[Keith Jardine]], [[Donald Cerrone]] and other skilled MMA fighters at Greg Jackson's Submission Fighting [[Gaidojutsu]] school in [[New Mexico]]. Some of Jackson's students accompanied St-Pierre to Montreal to help prepare him for his fight at [[UFC 94]] against [[B.J. Penn]] at the Tristar Gym, including Keith Jardine, Nathan Marquardt, Donald Cerrone and Rashad Evans. Georges' strength and conditioning coach is Jonathan Chaimberg of Adrenaline Performance Centre in Montr<U+00E9>al. Georges' Head Trainer is Firas Zahabi of Zahabi MMA, out of the Tristar gym. The two have cornered all of St-Pierre's most recent bouts and remain as his close friends. Currently, St-Pierre trains in [[Muay Thai]] under [[Phil Nurse]] at the Wat in New York City.<ref name="KRUPN1">{{cite news|title=Kru Phil<U+2019>s Athletes & Appearances|url=http://www.watgear.com/aboutus.php|accessdate=10 April 2012|newspaper=Wat Gear|year=2009}}</ref>

In September 2010, St-Pierre travelled to the Philippines for the first time to promote mixed martial arts to the Filipinos. He received a warm welcome for his first visit in Manila.<ref>{{cite news |title=GSP Hits Manila (Meets Pacquiao, Press Conference and Dance on Teen Show!) |work=fighttime.net |accessdate=September 27, 2010 |quote= |url=http://fighttime.net/2010/09/24/gsp-hits-manila-meet-pacquiao-qa-and-dance/}}</ref>

===Ultimate Fighting Championship===
St-Pierre made his UFC debut at [[UFC 46]], where he defeated highly ranked [[Karo Parisyan]] by unanimous decision. His next fight in the UFC was against [[Jay Hieron]] at [[UFC 48]]. St-Pierre defeated Hieron via technical knockout in only 1:42 of the first round.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sherdog.com/pictures/event/UFC-48-Pictures-1779 |title=UFC 48 Pictures: Georges St-Pierre vs Jay Hieron |last=Sherwood |first=Jeff |date=June 22, 2004 |work=Sherdog.com |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref>

Following his second win in the UFC, he faced [[Matt Hughes (fighter)|Matt Hughes]] at [[UFC 50]] for the vacant UFC Welterweight Championship. Despite a competitive performance against the much more experienced fighter, St-Pierre tapped out to an armbar with only 1 second remaining in the first round.<ref name="weighty">{{cite web |url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/weighty-issues-10826 |title=Weighty Issues |last=Cotterill |first=Andy |date=January 16, 2008 |work=Sherdog.com |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref> The loss was the first of St-Pierre's career and he has since admitted that he was in awe of Hughes going into the title bout.<ref name="weighty" />

After his loss to [[Matt Hughes (fighter)|Matt Hughes]], St-Pierre rebounded with a win over [[Dave Strasser]] at TKO 19 by a first-round [[Kimura lock|kimura]] submission.<ref>{{cite web |first=Freddie |last=DeFreitas |url=http://sherdog.com/pictures/event/7/TKO-19-Pictures-2386 |title=TKO 19 Pictures: Georges St-Pierre vs Dave Strasser |work=Sherdog.com |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref> He then returned to the UFC to face [[Jason Miller (fighter)|Jason Miller]] at [[UFC 52]], defeating Miller by unanimous decision in a bloody battle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/mma.cfm?go=stats.fighterDetail&pid=772E62A6D781C07D |title=Jason "Mayhem" Miller <U+2013> Official Mixed Martial Arts Fighting Resume |work=Mixedmartialarts.com |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref>

St-Pierre was then matched up against top contender [[Frank Trigg]] at [[UFC 54]]. St-Pierre controlled the fight and eventually snuck in a rear naked choke with less than a minute remaining in the first round.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Frank-Trigg-311 |title=Fight Finder <U+2013> Frank "Twinkle Toes" Trigg's Mixed Martial Arts Statistics |work=Sherdog.com |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref> He then faced future lightweight champion [[Sean Sherk]] at [[UFC 56]]. Midway through the second round, St-Pierre became the second fighter to defeat Sherk and the first to finish him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Sean-Sherk-277 |title=Fight Finder <U+2013> Sean "The Muscle Shark" Sherk's Mixed Martial Arts Statistics |work=Sherdog.com |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref>

At [[UFC 58]], St-Pierre defeated former UFC welterweight champion B.J. Penn to become the No. 1 contender for the UFC welterweight title. St-Pierre won the match by split decision and was set for a rematch against then-champion [[Matt Hughes (fighter)|Matt Hughes]] at [[UFC 63]]. St-Pierre was forced to withdraw from the match, however, due to a groin injury and was replaced by the man he defeated in March, B.J. Penn.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=news.detail&gid=3125 |title=St-Pierre Sidelined by Injury; 'The Prodigy' to The Rescue |date=August 23, 2006 |last=Gerbasi |first=Thomas |accessdate=July 6, 2007}}</ref> The UFC announced afterward that St-Pierre would have the opportunity to fight for the title when his condition was fully healed.

===''The Ultimate Fighter''===
St-Pierre was seen as a trainer on ''[[The Ultimate Fighter 4|The Ultimate Fighter 4: The Comeback]]'' on [[Spike TV]], which featured fighters who were previously seen in UFC events including [[Matt Serra]], [[Shonie Carter]], [[Pete Sell]], [[Patrick C<U+00F4>t<U+00E9> (fighter)|Patrick C<U+00F4>t<U+00E9>]], and [[Travis Lutter]]. St-Pierre was seen vocally supporting fellow Canadian and training partner Patrick C<U+00F4>t<U+00E9> during the season's airing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mmanews.com/ufc/MMANews.com-In-Depth-Pre-UFC-74-Interview-With-GSP.html |title=In-Depth Pre-UFC 74 Interview With GSP |work=Mmanews.Com |date=August 1, 2007 |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref>

===Winning and losing the title===
At UFC 63, St-Pierre made an appearance to support fellow Canadian [[David Loiseau|David "The Crow" Loiseau]]. At that time he was seen pushing Loiseau to "fight his fight" against [[Mike Swick]]. At the same event, after Matt Hughes had defeated B.J. Penn, St-Pierre stepped into the ring to hype up his upcoming title fight against Hughes, stating that he was glad that Hughes won his fight, but that he was "not impressed" by Hughes' performance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mmamania.com/2008/11/07/georges-st-pierre-im-not-impressed-with-your-performance-video/ |title=Georges St-Pierre "I'm not impressed by your performance" video |work=MMAmania.com |date=November 7, 2008 |format=video |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref>

According to both commentator [[Joe Rogan]] and Hughes' own autobiography, Hughes was unhappy with St-Pierre's statement. Hughes said that they "had words" off-camera shortly after, at which time St-Pierre apologized, saying he had misunderstood something Hughes had said on the microphone and did not mean to offend him. St-Pierre challenged Matt Hughes again at [[UFC 65]] for the UFC Welterweight Championship. The fight was almost stopped near the end of the first round when St-Pierre sent Hughes to the mat with a [[superman punch]] and left hook, but Hughes managed to survive the first round. In the second round, St-Pierre won the fight via technical knockout after a left kick to Hughes' head followed by a barrage of unanswered punches and elbows.  After the fight, on January 30, 2007, St-Pierre signed a new six-fight deal with the UFC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mmaweekly.com/georges-st-pierre-signs-new-ufc-deal-2 |title=Georges St-Pierre Signs New UFC Deal |date=January 30, 2007 |accessdate=February 3, 2009 |work=MMAWeekly.com}}</ref>

At [[UFC 69]], St-Pierre lost the welterweight title to ''The Ultimate Fighter 4'' winner [[Matt Serra]] when he made St-Pierre tap to strikes at 3:25 of round one. Matt Serra was an 11<U+2013>1 underdog going into the bout.<ref>{{citation |title=Georges St.-Pierre suffers loss to underdog Matt Serra at UFC 69: Shootout

St-Pierre has said that he lost the match partially due to a lack of focus because of problems in his personal life, including the death of a close cousin and his father's serious illness,<ref>{{cite web |last=Meltzer |first=Dave |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/4171/georges-st-pierres-time-to-shine.mma |title=Georges St-Pierre's time to shine |work=MMAjunkie.com |date=April 18, 2008 |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref> and later parted ways with his manager and most of his entourage.

===Road back to title contention===
[[File:GeorgeStPierre.jpg|thumb|left|St-Pierre in 2007]]

On August 25, 2007, at ''[[UFC 74]]'' St-Pierre won a unanimous decision over [[Josh Koscheck]] (30<U+2013>27, 29<U+2013>28, 29<U+2013>28).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mmanews.com/page.php?page=ufc74results |title=UFC 74 "Respect" results |publisher=MMANews.com |date=August 25, 2007 |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref> He outwrestled Koscheck, who is a four-time Division I NCAA All-American and an NCAA wrestling champion, by scoring takedowns, stopping Koscheck's takedown attempts and maintaining top position throughout most of the fight.<ref>{{cite web |author=The MMA Digest |url=http://www.themmadigest.com/2007/08/st-pierre-indeed-outwrestled-the-wrestler/ |title=St-Pierre indeed Outwrestled the Wrestler |publisher=TheMMADigest.com |date=August 26, 2007 |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref> Many predicted that Koscheck would outmatch St-Pierre on the ground due to his credentials, but St-Pierre was confident that he was a better wrestler and striker and was more well-versed in submissions than Koscheck.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news?slug=dm-stpierre112507&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=UFC calls on St-Pierre |work=Sports.yahoo.com |date=November 25, 2007 |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref>

Before and after the fight, St-Pierre stated his intention to reclaim his lost title, miming the act of placing a championship belt around his waist while still in the octagon. His win over Koscheck had placed him in the No. 1 contender spot for the UFC Welterweight Championship. That fight was to be against the winner of Matt Hughes and Matt Serra. Matt Serra had to pull out of [[UFC 79]] due to a back injury sustained during training,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://maximus03.wordpress.com/2007/11/23/matt-serra-pulls-out-of-ufc-79-title-fight-with-back-injury/ |title=Matt Serra pulls out of UFC 79 title fight with back injury |work=The General's Orders |date=November 23, 2007 |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref> and instead St-Pierre faced Hughes in a [[rubber match]] for the interim UFC Welterweight Championship. Hughes was unable to mount any serious offense against St-Pierre, who again showcased his wrestling skills by not only avoiding all of Hughes' takedown attempts, but also taking Hughes down at will.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stupp |first=Dann |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/3420/ufc-79-round-by-round-updates-and-live-results.mma |title=UFC 79 <U+2013> Round-by-Round Updates and Live Results |work=MMAjunkie.com |date=December 29, 2007 |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref> In a reversal of their first fight, St-Pierre attempted a [[Kimura lock|kimura]] on Hughes' right arm,<ref>{{cite web |first=Rami |last=Genauer |url=http://news.proelite.com/84942 |title=Fight metric: Hughes vs. St-Pierre III by the numbers |publisher=ProElite.com |date=December 27, 2007 |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref> then switched to a straight [[armbar]] with fifteen seconds left in the second round.

At [[UFC 83]] on April 19, 2008, St-Pierre fought [[Matt Serra]] to determine the undisputed UFC welterweight champion. It was the UFC's first event in Canada and was held at the [[Bell Centre]] in [[Montreal]], Qu<U+00E9>bec.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canadastarboxing.com/ufc/2008/ufc83/bout.htm |title=UFC 83: Serra vs. St-Pierre 2 |work=CanadastarBoxing.com |date=April 19, 2008 |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref> Instead of starting with strikes, St-Pierre pressed the action early with a takedown and then mixed up his attack, which never allowed Serra the chance to mount a significant offense.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/UFC-83-Play-by-Play-12383 |title=UFC 83 Play-by-Play |work=Sherdog.com |date=April 19, 2008 |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref> In the second round, St-Pierre continued his previous actions and forced Serra into the turtle position and delivered several knees to Serra's midsection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pointspread.com/Misc/Boxing/content/UFC-87-odds:-Seek-%2526amp%3B-Destroy |title=UFC 87 odds: Seek & Destroy |work=Pointspread.com |accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref> Near the end of round two, the fight was stopped by referee Yves Lavigne with a visibly gassed Serra unable to defend himself from St-Pierre's continuous knee blows or improve his position.

===Defending the title and beyond===
St-Pierre's first title defense after regaining the belt was against [[Jon Fitch]] at [[UFC 87]]. Fitch was on a 16-fight winning streak and a victory against St-Pierre would have been Fitch's ninth consecutive UFC win, a new UFC record. St-Pierre defeated Jon Fitch by unanimous decision with scores of 50<U+2013>43, 50<U+2013>44, and 50<U+2013>44,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kocosports.com/absolutenm/anmviewer.asp?a=23041&z=2 |title=Georges St-Pierre scores a unanimous UFC 87 decision Over Jon Fitch |date=August 10, 2008 |first=Scott |last=Adams}}</ref> scoring multiple devastating strikes and taking the former [[Purdue]] wrestling captain down seemingly at will.

The win over Fitch set up one of the most anticipated rematches in UFC history. [[BJ Penn]] entered the octagon after Fitch's loss and challenged St-Pierre to a rematch of their [[UFC 58]] bout from 2006, which had ended in a split-decision victory for St-Pierre. The rematch took place on January 31, 2009, at [[UFC 94]]. The first round of the fight was nearly even, with both men exchanging punches and Penn exercising elusive head movement, fast hands, good take-down defense - thwarting all of St-Pierre's take-down attempts. In the ensuing three rounds, however, Penn put forth a lackluster performance. St-Pierre dominated the rest of the bout, scoring the first take-down of the night midway through the second round and from that point on, taking Penn down at will, repeatedly passing his guard, and persistently punishing the Hawaiian with a brutal [[ground-and-pound]] attack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/13877/ufc-94-round-by-round-updates-official-results-and-tonights-winners.mma|publisher=MMAJunkie.com|accessdate=July 2, 2009|date=January 31, 2009|title=UFC 94 round by round updates}}</ref>

The fight ended after the fourth round when Penn's cornerman, Jason Parillo, requested that the referee stop the fight. Penn failed to attend the post-fight press conference due to hospitalization for injuries. Penn later admitted that he could not recall anything that happened during the 3rd and 4th rounds because "I was probably borderline knocked out or something."<ref name="bjpenn.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.bjpenn.com/profiles/blogs/bj-penn-im-still-the|title=BJ Penn: I'm Still The Light Weight Champ.

During the fight, Penn complained that St-Pierre was too slippery to hold, which led to suspicion about petroleum jelly being illegally applied to St-Pierre's back. The matter was formally investigated by the UFC and Nevada State Athletic Commission upon the request of the Penn camp.<ref>{{cite news |first=Lance |last=Pugmire |title=B.J.

"Do I think that he got greased? Yeah, I do," White told ''The Canadian Press'' prior to the UFC 95 weigh-in Friday at the Dominion Theatre. "Absolutely, 100 per cent, I think that that guy was rubbing grease on him. "Do I think Georges was trying to cheat? Absolutely not at all, but that cornerman was rubbing grease on him; you cannot do that."<ref>{{cite news |first= CP |title=UFC'S WHITE SAYS GSP WAS ILLEGALLY GREASED AGAINST PENN |work=TSN |date=February 20, 2009 |accessdate=October 22, 2011 |quote= |url=http://www.tsn.ca/mma/story/?id=267945}}</ref>

Prior to [[UFC 100]], Beau Dure of ''[[USA Today]]'' stated that St-Pierre was possibly "the best in the world."<ref>{{cite news |first=Beau |last=Dure |title=Sharp-dressed St. Pierre man in the middle at UFC 100 in Vegas |work=USA Today |date=July 11, 2009 |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |quote= |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/mma/2009-07-10-gsp2-100_N.htm}}</ref> At the event, St-Pierre defeated No. 1 contender [[Thiago Alves]]. Alves showed promise on his feet standing up in the fight, but St-Pierre's wrestling offensive, endurance and ground control proved too much for the challenger and put St-Pierre en route to a unanimous decision victory, despite suffering a pulled groin muscle in the third round. While St-Pierre said in his post fight interview that the injury was sustained in the third round, he later said on his blog that the injury in fact occurred in the fourth round.<ref>{{cite web |last=St. Pierre |first=Georges |url=http://stpierre.yardbarker.com/blog/StPierre/UFC_100_Notable_Moments/808571 |title=UFC 100 Notable Moments |work=YardBarker.com |date=July 15, 2009}}</ref> On July 18, 2009, it was revealed that St-Pierre's groin injury would not require surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmawaves.com/2009/07/18/georges-st-pierre-wont-need-surgery-for-groin-injury|title=Georges St. Pierre Won<U+2019>t Need Surgery For Groin Injury |work=MMAWaves.com|date=July 18, 2009 }}</ref>

He caught Hardy in the first round with an armbar, but Hardy refused to tap and eventually fought out of the hold. In the fourth round St-Pierre caught Hardy in a kimura while in the reverse-mount position, but St-Pierre was again unable to finish Hardy before he was able to escape.

St-Pierre's next fight was a rematch against [[Josh Koscheck]] at [[UFC 124]] where he won by unanimous decision. [http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/mma/news/story?id=5910146]  St-Pierre once again dominated the fight, this time around by use of superior striking and accurate boxing. He landed a total of 55 jabs to Koscheck's head <ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.fightmetric.com/2010/12/gsp-vs-koscheck-ii-fightmetric-report.html |title=FightMetric: GSP vs. Koscheck II FightMetric Report |publisher=Blog.fightmetric.com |date=December 12, 2010 |accessdate=May 5, 2011}}</ref> with [[Joe Rogan]] stating that it was "the most jabs I've ever seen in an MMA fight." During the first round, Koscheck's right eye became very swollen from one of St-Pierre's jabs and by the end of the fight, due to a broken [[orbital bone]], his right eye was completely swollen shut. St-Pierre stated at the post-fight conference that his plan included catching Koscheck off-guard by striking with him rather than  wrestling.

UFC president [[Dana White]] stated that [[Jake Shields]] would be St-Pierre's next opponent and confirmed that the two would meet in the main event of [[UFC 129]] on April 30, 2011, in Toronto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmaweekly.com/report-georges-st-pierre-vs-jake-shields-set-for-ufc-129-in-toronto|title=Report: Georges St-Pierre vs. Jake Shields Set For UFC 129 in Toronto|publisher=MMAWeekly.com|accessdate =January 2, 2011}}</ref> White suggested that if St-Pierre defeated Shields, it could mark a move to middleweight and a superfight against [[Anderson Silva]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Morgan |first=John |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/22184/ufcs-georges-st-pierre-vs-anderson-silva-superfight-could-happen-in-2011.mma |title=UFC's Georges St-Pierre vs. Anderson Silva superfight could happen in 2011 |publisher=MMAjunkie.com |date=January 22, 2011 |accessdate=May 5, 2011}}</ref> St-Pierre defeated Shields via unanimous decision.

At the [[UFC 129]] post-fight press conference, UFC President Dana White stated that St-Pierre could next fight [[Strikeforce]] Welterweight champion [[Nick Diaz]]. "I've got to go talk him about boxing first, and then we'll see what happens there. It's an interesting fight," White said. "I was there live for that last fight and I was blown away by Nick Diaz<U+2019>s last fight.

However, on December 7, 2011, it was revealed St-Pierre had sustained an [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] injury to his right knee and would require him to be out for up to ten months, forcing him out of the bout with Diaz. At [[UFC 143]], in a fight for the UFC Interim Welterweight Championship, Diaz lost to Condit. 

St-Pierre was set to return and fight Condit for the undisputed championship on November 17, 2012 at [[UFC 154]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/29129/st-pierre-vs-condit-hendricks-vs-kampmann-targeted-for-ufc-154-in-montreal.mma|title=St-Pierre vs. Condit targeted for UFC 154 in Montreal |publisher=mmajunkie.com |date=June 9, 2012 |accessdate=June 9, 2012}}</ref> On August 28, 2012, St-Pierre posted to his official Facebook page that he had the green light from his medical team to compete once again. He ended his post by announcing that his return would be in [[UFC 154]], in which he was to fight Carlos Condit. 

St-Pierre once again successfully defended his welterweight title on November 17, 2012 at [[UFC 154]] against Condit, winning a unanimous decision. Despite being badly hurt in the third round by a headkick, St-Pierre was able take down Condit repeatedly during the bout, while defending multiple submission attempts and deliver multiple strikes from Condit's active [[guard (grappling)|guard]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/georgesstpierre/posts/10152064581645650|title=Medically cleared for UFC 154 in Montreal |publisher=www.facebook.com/georgesstpierre |date=August 28, 2012 |accessdate=August 28, 2012}}</ref>  Both participants earned ''Fight of the Night'' honors for their performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/31681/ufc-154-results-champ-georges-st-pierre-vs-carlos-condit.mma |title=UFC 154 results: Champ St-Pierre downs Condit in thriller |publisher=mmajunkie.com |date=2012-11-18}}</ref>
