'''The J.B.'s''' (sometimes punctuated '''The JB's''' or '''The J.B.s''') were [[James Brown]]'s band during the first half of the 1970s. On record the J.B.'s were sometimes billed under various alternate names such as '''The James Brown Soul Train''', '''Maceo and the Macks''', '''A.A.B.B.''', '''The First Family''' and '''The Last Word'''. In addition to backing Brown the J.B.'s played behind [[Bobby Byrd]], [[Lyn Collins]] and other singers associated with the James Brown Revue, as well as performing as a self-contained group.

==Career==
===The "original" J.B.'s===
The J.B.'s were formed in March 1970 after most of the members of Brown's previous band walked out on him over a pay dispute. (Brown's previous bands of the 50s and 60s had been known as The James Brown Band and The James Brown Orchestra.) The J.B.'s initial lineup included bassist [[Bootsy Collins|William "Bootsy" Collins]] and his guitarist brother [[Catfish Collins|Phelps "Catfish" Collins]], formerly of the obscure [[funk]] band [[The Pacemakers (funk band)|The Pacemakers]]; Bobby Byrd (organ) and [[John "Jabo" Starks]] (drums), both holdovers from Brown's 60s band; three inexperienced horn players, Clayton "Chicken" Gunnells, Darryl "Hasaan" Jamison, and Robert McCollough; and [[conga]] player Johnny Griggs. This version of the J.B.'s played on some of Brown's most intense [[funk]] recordings, including "[[Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine]]", "[[Super Bad (song)|Super Bad]]", "[[Soul Power]]", and "[[Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothing]]". They also accompanied Brown on a European tour (during which they recorded the long-delayed [[live album]] ''[[Love Power Peace]]''), performed on the ''[[Sex Machine (album)|Sex Machine]]'' double LP, and released two [[instrumental]] [[Single (music)|singles]], the much-[[Sampling (music)|sampled]] "[[The Grunt]]" and "These Are the J.B.'s".

===Other lineups===
In December 1970 [[Trombone|trombonist]] [[Fred Wesley]] rejoined James Brown's organization to lead the J.B.'s. Other former Brown sidemen including [[Maceo Parker]] and [[St. Clair Pinckney]] eventually followed his lead, while the Collins brothers and most of the rest of the "original" J.B.'s left Brown to join [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]]'s [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] collective. The J.B.'s lineup shifted frequently thereafter until the group disbanded in [[1976 in music|1976]] following the departures of Wesley and Parker.

===Recordings===
In addition to backing Brown on stage and on record during this era, the J.B.'s also recorded [[album]]s and [[single (music)|singles]] on their own, sometimes with Brown performing on [[Electronic organ|organ]] or [[synthesizer]]. Their albums were generally a mixture of heavy funk tracks and some more [[jazz]]-oriented pieces. They scored a number of chart hits in the early 1970s, including "Pass the Peas," "Gimme Some More," and the #1 R&B hit, "[[Doing It to Death]]". Credited to "Fred Wesley & the J.B.'s", "Doing It to Death" sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[R.I.A.A.]] in July 1973.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

The group also released a single, "Pick up the Pieces One By One", under the name A.A.B.B., which reached #108 on the U.S. charts in 1975.<ref name=whitburn>[[Joel Whitburn]], ''Top Pop Singles 1955-2008''.

Like most of James Brown's music, the J.B.'s recorded output has been heavily mined for [[Sampling (music)|samples]] by [[hip hop music|hip hop]] [[Disk jockey|DJs]] and record producers.

===The JB Horns===
During the 1980s and 90s Maceo Parker and Fred Wesley intermittently toured under the name '''The JB Horns''', sometimes with other former Brown sidemen such as [[Alfred "Pee Wee" Ellis]] in tow. The JB Horns recorded several albums for the [[Gramavision Records|Gramavision]] label which were later [[reissue]]d by [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]]. They also recorded an album under this name with producers [[Jeff McCray]] and [[Richard Mazda]] called ''I Like It Like That''.

===Reunion===
A version of the J.B.'s including Fred Wesley, Bootsy Collins, Pee Wee Ellis, Bobby Byrd and [[Clyde Stubblefield]] assembled to record the 1999 "reunion" album ''Bring the Funk on Down'' dedicated to the memory of St. Clair Pinckney. Album released in Japan by [[P-Vine Records]], later in 2002 reissued in USA by Instinct Records.
