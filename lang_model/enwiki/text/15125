'''Hristo Naumov Shopov''' ({{lang-bg|<U+0425><U+0440><U+0438><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E> <U+041D><U+0430><U+0443><U+043C><U+043E><U+0432> <U+0428><U+043E><U+043F><U+043E><U+0432>}}) (born 4 January 1964 in [[Sofia]]) is a [[Bulgaria]]n actor. Shopov's father, [[Naum Shopov]], was a famous Bulgarian actor as well.

He is most noted for his portrayal of [[Pontius Pilate]] in [[Mel Gibson]]'s ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''. He has become one of Bulgaria's most successful actors, making his debut in 1981 with ''Dishay, choveche'' (Breathe, Little Man!). His body of work includes many Bulgarian films such as ''[[Vchera]]'' (Yesterday) and ''Sledvay me'' (Follow Me). He has also appeared in several low-budget US film productions including ''[[Phantom Force]]'', ''[[Target of Opportunity]]'' and ''[[Alien Hunter]]''. In his homeland, he is best known for his role in the movie ''Vchera'', which became a symbol of several generations. The movie tells the story of young Bulgarian people studying in an English college during Communist rule.

Mary Soan, an assistant director of the film ''[[I Am David (film)|I Am David]]'', suggested that he would be suited for the role of Pilate to [[Shaila Rubin]], who was casting the film. After Hristo and Gibson had a brief conversation, Hristo was given the part. Shopov also played the role of Pontius Pilate in the 2006 film ''The Inquiry'', which also cast [[Max von Sydow]] as Emperor Tiberius.

He recently played the Russian premier in the upcoming ''[[Command Performance (2008 film)|Command Performance]]'' starring and directed by [[Dolph Lundgren]]. In 2011 he starred in the films ''[[Love.net]]'' and ''[[Operation Shmenti Capelli]]''.
