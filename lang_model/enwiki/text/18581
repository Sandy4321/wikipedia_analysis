'''''King Ottokar's Sceptre''''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|'''Le Sceptre d'Ottokar'''}}) is the eighth volume of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', the comics series by Belgian cartoonist [[Herg<U+00E9>]]. Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper {{lang|fr|''[[Le Vingti<U+00E8>me Si<U+00E8>cle]]''}} for its children's supplement {{lang|fr|''[[Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me]]''}}, it was serialised weekly from August 1938 to August 1939. Herg<U+00E9> intended the story as a satirical criticism of the expansionist policies of [[Nazi Germany]], in particular the [[annexation]] of [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] in March 1938 (the ''[[Anschluss]]''). The story tells of young Belgian reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and his dog [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]], who travel to the fictional Balkan nation of [[Syldavia]], where they combat a plot to overthrow the monarchy of [[King Muskar XII]].

''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' was published in book form shortly after its conclusion. Herg<U+00E9> continued ''The Adventures of Tintin'' with ''[[Land of Black Gold]]'' until {{lang|fr|''Le Vingti<U+00E8>me Si<U+00E8>cle''}}'s closure in 1939, while the series itself became a defining part of the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian comics tradition]].  In 1947, Herg<U+00E9> coloured and redrew ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' in his distinctive ''{{lang|fr|[[Ligne claire|ligne-claire]]}}'' style with the aid of [[Edgar P. Jacobs]] for [[Casterman]]'s republication.  ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' introduces the recurring character [[Bianca Castafiore]], and introduced the fictional countries of Syldavia and [[Borduria]], both of which reappear in later stories. The story was adapted for both the 1956 [[Belvision Studios]] animation ''[[Herg<U+00E9>'s Adventures of Tintin]]'' and for the 1991 [[Ellipse Programm<U+00E9>|Ellipse]]/[[Nelvana]] animated series ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (TV series)|The Adventures of Tintin]]''.

==Synopsis==
Having discovered a lost briefcase in a Belgian park, Tintin returns it to its owner, the [[sigillography|sigillographer]] Professor [[Professor Alembick|Hector Alembick]], who informs the reporter of his plans to travel to the [[Balkans|Balkan nation]] of Syldavia. Tintin discovers agents spying on him and follows those responsible to a nearby Syldavian restaurant.{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|1947|pp=1<U+2013>7}} An unknown man agrees to meet with Tintin but is found unconscious. Shortly after, the reporter receives a threatening note and is then the target of a bomb attack; Tintin survives the latter when police detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] intercept the bomb. Suspecting that these events are linked to Syldavia, Tintin decides to accompany Professor Alembick on his forthcoming visit to the country.{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|1947|pp=7<U+2013>15}} On the plane journey there, Tintin notices Alembick acting out of character, and suspects that an imposter has replaced him. Reading a brochure on Syldavian history, Tintin theorises that the imposter is part of a plot to steal the [[sceptre]] of the Medieval King Ottokar IV from the current [[King Muskar XII]] before St. Vladimir's Day, thus forcing him to [[abdication|abdicate]].{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|1947|pp=15<U+2013>22}}

Forcibly ejected from the plane by the pilot, Tintin survives and informs local police of his fears regarding the plot. However, the police captain is part of the conspiracy, and he organises an ambush in the woods where Tintin will be eliminated. Tintin evades death, and heads to the capital city of Klow in a car carrying the opera singer [[Bianca Castafiore]].{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|1947|pp=23<U+2013>28}} Leaving the car to evade Castafiore's singing, Tintin is arrested again and survives another assassination attempt before heading to Klow by foot. Arriving in the city, he meets the King's ''[[aide-de-camp]]'', [[Colonel Jorgen|Colonel Boris]], and warns him of the plot. However, Boris is also a conspirator and organises a further unsuccessful assassination attempt aimed at Tintin.{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|1947|pp=29<U+2013>38}}

Tintin succeeds in personally warning the King about the plot. Concerned, Tintin and Muskar rush to Kropow Castle, where the sceptre is kept, to find that the imposter pretending to be Alembick has succeeded in smuggling it out of the building to his accomplices.{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|1947|pp=38<U+2013>46}} With the aid of Thomson and Thompson, who have recently arrived in Syldavia, Tintin pursues the thieves, first by car and then by foot. He is able to prevent the sceptre being carried over the border into neighbouring Borduria, discovering a letter on one of the conspirators. It reveals that the plot has been orchestrated by [[M<U+00FC>sstler]], a political agitator who runs the Syldavian Iron Guard, or Zyldav Zentral Revolutzion<U+00E4>r Komitz<U+00E4>t (ZZRK), and who intends to stir up unrest in Syldavia, thereby allowing Borduria to invade and annex the country.{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|1947|pp=47<U+2013>53}} Entering Borduria, Tintin commandeers a fighter jet and heads to Klow, but the Syldavian military shoot him down. Parachuting, he continues to Klow by foot, returning the sceptre to the King on St. Vladimir's Day and securing the monarchy. In thanks, the king makes Tintin a Knight of the Order of the Golden Pelican; the first foreigner to receive the honour. Tintin reveals that the imposter was Alembick's twin brother while police arrest M<U+00FC>sstler and rescue Professor Alembick.{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|1947|pp=54<U+2013>60}}

==History==

===Background===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1985-083-10, Anschluss <U+00D6>sterreich, Wien.jpg|thumb|The ''Anschluss'': cheering crowds greet the Nazis in [[Vienna]]]]
Georges Remi<U+2014>best known under the pen name [[Herg<U+00E9>]]<U+2014>was employed as editor and illustrator of {{lang|fr|''[[Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me]]''}} ("''The Little Twentieth''"),{{sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=1989|1pp=31<U+2013>32|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2pp=24<U+2013>25}} a children's supplement to {{lang|fr|''[[Le Vingti<U+00E8>me Si<U+00E8>cle]]''}} ("''The Twentieth Century''"), a staunchly Roman Catholic, [[social conservatism|conservative]] Belgian newspaper based in Herg<U+00E9>'s native Brussels, run by the ''[[Abb<U+00E9>]]'' [[Norbert Wallez]].  In 1929, Herg<U+00E9> began ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comic strip for {{lang|fr|''Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me''}}, revolving around the exploits of fictional Belgian reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=22<U+2013>23|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=34<U+2013>37}}

As Herg<U+00E9> had previously made use of the 1931 [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] as a political backdrop for the setting in ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'', ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' would be the second Tintin adventure to draw specifically on contemporary events.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=61}} Herg<U+00E9> had closely observed the unfolding events surrounding the expansionist policies of [[Nazi Germany]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=97}} In producing this story, he was particularly influenced by the ''[[Anschluss]]'', the annexation of [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] by Nazi Germany in March 1938.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=82|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=81|3a1=Assouline|3y=2009|3p=61|4a1=Peeters|4y=2012|4p=97|5a1=Goddin|5y=2009|5pp=40}} The [[Munich Agreement]] and the subsequent [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Nazi invasion of the Sudetenland]] followed in October 1938.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=81|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=97|3a1=Goddin|3y=2009|3pp=40,49}} Three weeks after ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' finished serialisation, Germany invaded Poland.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=81|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=62|3a1=Goddin|3y=2009|3p=50}} By this point, the threat to Belgian sovereignty posed by Nazi expansionism was becoming increasingly clear.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=97}}

Herg<U+00E9> claimed that the basic idea behind the story had been given to him by a friend; biographer [[Beno<U+00EE>t Peeters]] suggested that the most likely candidate was school and [[scouting]] friend Philippe G<U+00E9>rard, who had warned of a second war with Germany for years.{{sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=2012|1p=98|2a1=Goddin|2y=2009|2p=40}} ''Tintin'' scholars have claimed Herg<U+00E9> did not develop the names ''Syldavia'' and ''Borduria'' himself;{{efn|At first, Herg<U+00E9> named the country "Sylduria".{{sfn|Goddin|2009}} }} instead, the country names had supposedly appeared in a paper included in a 1937 edition of the ''[[British Journal of Psychology]]'', in which the author described a hypothetical conflict between a small kingdom and an annexing power.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=82|2a1=Lib<U+00E9>ration|2y=2006}} Reportedly, the paper, by [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] and entitled "General Foreign Policy", explored the nature of inter-state conflict in a [[mathematics|mathematical]] way.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=82|2a1=Lib<U+00E9>ration|2y=2006}} Peeters attributed these claims to Georges Laurenceau, but said that "no researcher has confirmed this source". Instead, a paper by Richardson entitled "Generalized Foreign Politics: A Story in Group Psychology" was published in ''The British Journal of Psychology Monograph Supplements'' in 1939, but did not mention ''Syldavia'' or ''Borduria''. In any case, given the publication date, it would be unlikely to be an influence for ''King Ottokar's Sceptre''.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=325}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote="At the time, Germany was of course on my mind; ''Ottokar's Sceptre'' is nothing other than the tale of a failed Anschluss. But one can take it to be any other totalitarian regime&nbsp;... Moreover, isn't the villain of ''Ottokar's Sceptre'' called [[M<U+00FC>sstler]], evidently a combination of Mussolini and Hitler? It strikes me as a clear allusion."|source=Herg<U+00E9>, talking to [[Numa Sadoul]]{{sfnm|1a1=Sadoul|1y=1975|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=82}} }}

Herg<U+00E9> designed Borduria as a satirical depiction of Nazi Germany.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=83|2a1=Apostolid<U+00E8>s|2y=2010|2p=29}}
Herg<U+00E9> named the Bordurian political leader "[[M<U+00FC>sstler]]", a [[portmanteau]] of the surnames of [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]] and Italy's [[National Fascist Party|National Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]].{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=82|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=43|3a1=Assouline|3y=2009|3p=62|4a1=Peeters|4y=2012|4p=98}} The name also had similarities with the [[British Union of Fascists]]' leader [[Oswald Mosley]] and the [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands]]' leader [[Anton Mussert]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=98}}
Herg<U+00E9> depicted M<U+00FC>sstler as having a moustache akin to that of Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]].{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=62}} Herg<U+00E9> referred to M<U+00FC>sstler's agents as the Iron Guard, thereby naming them after the real [[Iron Guard]], a Romanian fascist group that sought to oust [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]] and forge a Romanian-German alliance.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=82|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=81}} The Bordurian officers wore uniforms based on those of the German [[Schutzstaffel|SS]],{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=83|2a1=Apostolid<U+00E8>s|2y=2010|2p=29}} while the Bordurian planes are German in design; in the original version Tintin escapes in a [[Heinkel He 112]],{{sfn|Goddin|2009|p=50}} while in the revised version this is replaced by a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]].{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1pp=84<U+2013>85|2a1=Apostolid<U+00E8>s|2y=2010|2p=29}} Herg<U+00E9> adopted the basis of Borduria's false flag operation to take over Syldavia from the plans outlined in [[Curzio Malaparte]]'s ''Tecnica del Colpo di Stato'' ("''The Technique of a Coup d'Etat''").{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=99}}

Syldavia's depiction was influenced by the costumes and cultures of the [[Balkans]] region, as well as those of neighbouring Romania and Albania.{{sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=2012|1p=100|2a1=Goddin|2y=2009|2p=50}} The mosques that appear in Herg<U+00E9>'s Syldavia are based on those found in the Balkan region,{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=83|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=81}} while the black pelican of Syldavia's flag is similar to Albania's black eagle.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=81}} Czech, Slovak, and Bohemian history influenced the Syldavian names,{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=62}} while several [[List of rulers of Bohemia|medieval Bohemian kings]] were the inspiration for the name "Ottokar".{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=83|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=81}} The [[Polish language]] influenced Herg<U+00E9>'s inclusion of "-ow" endings to Syldavian place names, while Polish history paralleled Herg<U+00E9>'s description of Syldavian history.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=81}} 
The [[Syldavian|Syldavian language]] used in the book had French syntax but with [[Marols|Marollien]] vocabulary, a joke understood by the original Brussels-based readership.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=62}}

However, despite its Eastern European location, Syldavia itself was partly a metaphor for Belgium, with Syldavian King Muskar XII physically resembling King [[Leopold III of Belgium]].{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=82|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=100}}{{efn|King [[Zog I of Albania]] also resembled Syldavian King Muskar XII.{{sfn|Goddin|2009|p=50}} }} Herg<U+00E9>'s decision to create a fictional East European kingdom might have been influenced by [[Ruritania]], the fictional country created by [[Anthony Hope]] for his novel ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' (1894) and which subsequently appeared in film adaptations in [[The Prisoner of Zenda (1913 film)|1913]], [[The Prisoner of Zenda (1915 film)|1915]], [[The Prisoner of Zenda (1922 film)|1922]], and [[The Prisoner of Zenda (1937 film)|1937]].{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=43}} Many places within Syldavia are visually based on pre-existing European sites; the ''[[Diplodocus]]'' in the Klow Natural History Museum is based on the one in the [[Museum f<U+00FC>r Naturkunde]], [[Berlin]], while the Syldavian Royal Palace is based on the [[Charlottenburg Palace]], Berlin.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=82}}

===Original publication===
''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' was first serialised in ''Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me'' from 4 August 1938 to 10 August 1939 under the title ''Tintin En Syldavie'' ("''Tintin in Syldavia''").{{sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=1989|1p=62|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=42|3a1=Goddin|3y=2009|3p=37}} It would prove to be the last Tintin adventure to be published in its entirety in ''Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me''.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=42}} From 14 May 1939, the story was also serialised in the French Catholic newspaper, ''[[C<U+0153>urs Vaillants]]''.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=42}}
In 1939, [[Casterman|<U+00C9>ditions Casterman]] collected the story together in a single hardcover volume; Herg<U+00E9> insisted to his contact at Casterman, Charles Lesne, that they hurry up the process due to the changing political situation in Europe.{{sfnm|1a1=Lofficier|1a2=Lofficier|1y=2002|1p=42|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=62|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3pp=100<U+2013>101|4a1=Goddin|4y=2009|4p=53}} The Nazi<U+2013>Soviet [[Molotov<U+2013>Ribbentrop Pact]] was signed the day Herg<U+00E9> delivered the book's remaining drawings;{{sfn|Goddin|2009|p=57}} finishing touches included the book's original front cover, the royal coat of arms for the title page, and the tapestry depicting the Syldavian's 1127 victory over the Turks in "The Battle of Zileheroum" on page 20.{{sfn|Goddin|2009|pp=53,56<U+2013>57}} Herg<U+00E9> suggested that for this publication, the story's title be changed to ''The Scepter of Ottokar IV''; Casterman changed this to ''King Ottokar's Sceptre''.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=63}}

''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' introduced the recurring character of [[Bianca Castafiore]] to the series, who appears alongside her pianist [[Igor Wagner]].{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=84|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=43|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=100|4a1=Goddin|4y=2009|4p=43}} It also witnessed the introduction of antagonist [[Colonel Jorgen]], who reappears in the later Tintin adventures ''[[Destination Moon (comics)|Destination Moon]]'' and its sequel ''[[Explorers on the Moon]]''.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=84}} The Alembek brothers' inclusion echoes the Balthazar brothers' inclusion in ''[[The Broken Ear]]''.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=100}}

===Second version, 1947===
The story was redrawn and colourised in 1947. For this edition, Herg<U+00E9> was assisted by [[Edgar Pierre Jacobs]], an artist who worked as part of [[Studios Herg<U+00E9>]]. Jacobs oversaw changes to the costumes and background of the story; in the 1938 version, the Syldavian Royal Guards are dressed like British [[Beefeaters]], while the 1947 version has them dressed in a Balkanised uniform.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=84|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=87|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3p=44}} Jacobs also inserted a cameo of himself and his wife in the Syldavian royal court, while in that same scene is a cameo of Herg<U+00E9>, his then-wife Germaine, and his brother Paul.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=87|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=44}} Herg<U+00E9> and Jacobs also inserted further cameos of themselves at the bottom of page 38, where they appear as uniformed officers.{{sfn|Farr|2001|pp=87, 89}} While the character of Professor Alembick had been given the forename of Nestor in the original version, this was changed to Hector for the second; this had been done so as to avoid confusion with the character of [[Nestor (comics)|Nestor]], the butler of [[Marlinspike Hall]], whom Herg<U+00E9> had introduced in ''[[The Secret of the Unicorn]]''.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=84}}
Editions Casterman published this second version in book form in 1947.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=42}}

===Subsequent publications and legacy===
''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' became the first Tintin adventure to be published for a British audience when ''[[Eagle (comic)|The Eagle]]'' serialised the comic in 1951. Here, the names of Tintin and Milou were retained, although the characters of Dupond and Dupont were renamed Thomson and Thompson; the latter two names would be adopted by translators Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner when they later translated the series into English.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=86}}

Casterman republished the original black-and-white version of the story in 1980, as part of the fourth volume in their ''{{lang|fr|Archives Herg<U+00E9>}}'' collection.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=42}} In 1988, they then published a facsimile version of that first edition.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=42}}

==Critical analysis==
[[File:Benoit Peeters 20100329 Salon du livre de Paris 3.jpg|thumb|right|Herg<U+00E9> biographer [[Beno<U+00EE>t Peeters]] ''(pictured, 2010)'' felt that ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' showed "a political maturity".{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=99}}]]
[[Harry Thompson]] described ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' as a "biting political satire" and asserted that it was "courageous" of Herg<U+00E9> to have written it given that the threat of Nazi invasion was imminent.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=82}} Describing it as a "classic locked room mystery", he praised its "tightly constructed plot".{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=83}} Ultimately, he deemed it one of the best three Tintin adventures written before World War II, alongside ''The Blue Lotus'' and ''The Black Island''.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=83}} He also thought it noteworthy that in 1976, archaeologists discovered a sceptre belonging to a 13th-century King Ottokar in [[St. Vitus Cathedral]], [[Prague]].{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=83<U+2013>84}} Herg<U+00E9> biographer [[Pierre Assouline]] believed that the story had the atmosphere of [[Franz Leh<U+00E1>r]]'s ''[[The Merry Widow]]'', with "added touches" from the films of [[Erich von Stroheim]] and [[Ernst Lubitsch]].{{Sfn|Assouline|2009|p=62}} Fellow biographer [[Beno<U+00EE>t Peeters]] thought that it exhibited "a political maturity" and "originality". Further, he felt that Herg<U+00E9> was able to break free from the "narrative limits [of]&nbsp;... too much realism" by the use of Syldavia as a setting.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=99}}

[[Jean-Marc Lofficier]] and Randy Lofficier called ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' "a Hitchcockian thriller" which "recaptures the paranoid ambience" of ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]''.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=44}} They compared the pace of the latter part of the story to that of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' films before noting that despite the "horrors of the real world" that are present with Borduria's inclusion, they do not interfere in "the pure escapist nature of the adventure". Ultimately they awarded it three stars out of five.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=44}}

[[Michael Farr]] opined that the adventure has "a convincingly authentic feel" due to the satirical portrayal to Nazi Germany, but that this was coupled with "sufficient scope for invention" with the creation of Syldavia.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=85}} He compared it to Hitchcock's ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]''.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=85}} Farr preferred the colour version assembled with E.P. Jacobs' aid, however. Deeming it "particularly successful", he thought that it was "one of the most polished and accomplished" adventures in the series, with a "perfectly paced and balanced" narrative that mixed drama and comedy successfully.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=89}}

Literary critic [[Jean-Marie Apostolid<U+00E8>s]] of [[Stanford University]] asserted that the inclusion of the Iron Guard evoked Colonel [[Fran<U+00E7>ois de La Rocque]]'s [[Croix-de-Feu]].{{sfn|Apostolid<U+00E8>s|2010|p=29}} Noting that the figure of M<U+00FC>sstler was "the Evil One without a face", he expressed disbelief regarding Herg<U+00E9>'s depiction of Syldavia, as there were no apparent economic problems or reasons why M<U+00FC>sstler's anti-monarchist conspiracy was so strong; thus, "mass revolution remains schematic".{{sfn|Apostolid<U+00E8>s|2010|p=29}}

Literary critic [[Tom McCarthy (writer)|Tom McCarthy]] identified several instances in the story that he argued linked to wider themes within the ''Adventures of Tintin''. He identified a recurring host-and-guest theme in Alembick's visit to Syldavia,{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=70}} and believed that the theme of thieving was present in the story as Alembick's identity is stolen.{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=122}} Another theme identified within the series by McCarthy was that of the blurring between the sacred and the political; he saw echoes of this in ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' as the King has to wait three days before appearing to the Syldavian public on St. Vladimir's Day, something that McCarthy thought linked to [[Jesus Christ]] and the Resurrection.{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=53}} McCarthy also opined that a number of characters in the book visually resembled [[Captain Haddock]], a character who would be introduced in the subsequent Tintin adventure, ''The Crab with the Golden Claws''.{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=100}}

==Adaptations==
''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' was the first of ''The Adventures of Tintin'' to be adapted for the animated series ''[[Herg<U+00E9>'s Adventures of Tintin]]''. The series was created by Belgium's [[Belvision Studios]] in 1957, directed by Ray Goossens and written by [[Greg (comics)|Greg]]. The studio divided ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' into six 5-minute black-and-white episodes that diverted from Herg<U+00E9>'s original plot in many ways.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=87}} It was also adapted into a 1991 episode of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (TV series)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' television series by French studio [[Ellipse]] and Canadian animation company [[Nelvana]].{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=90}} The episode was directed by St<U+00E9>phane Bernasconi, and Thierry Wermuth voiced the character of Tintin.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=90}}

Tintin fans adopted the [[Syldavian]] language that appears in the story and used it to construct grammars and dictionaries, akin to the fan following of ''[[Star Trek]]'''s Klingon and Tolkien's Elvish.{{sfnm|1a1=Lofficier|1a2=Lofficier|1y=2002|1p=43|2a1=Rogers|2y=2011|2p=215|3a1=Rosenfelder|3y=1996}}
