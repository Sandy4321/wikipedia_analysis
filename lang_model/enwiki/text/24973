'''<U+015E>anl<U+0131>urfa''' (often simply known as '''Urfa''', formerly '''[[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]''') is a [[List of cities in Turkey|city]] in south-eastern [[Turkey]], and the capital of [[<U+015E>anl<U+0131>urfa Province]]. Urfa is situated on a plain under big open skies, about eighty kilometres east of the [[Euphrates River]]. The climate features extremely hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. 

Urfa has a history going back 9,000 years, was the birthplace of the prophets, was blessed by Jesus himself and was a powerful city for many civilisations. 

Population 385,588 ([[2000]] census) most of whom are [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], with significant Arab and ethnically [[Turkish people|Turkish]] minorities. <ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/images/dist-kurdish.gif Distribution of Kurdish People] <U+2014> [[GlobalSecurity.org]]</ref><ref>[http://geo.ya.com/travelimages/az-kurd-map.gif Administrative Units of Contemporary Kurdistan]</ref>

==Etymology==
The city has been known by many names: <U+0710><U+0718><U+072A><U+0717><U+071D>, ''Urh<U+0101>y'' in [[Syriac language|Syriac]], ''Riha'' in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], <U+0627><U+0644><U+0631><U+0648><U+0647><U+0627>, ''Ar-Ruha'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], <U+0548><U+0582><U+057C><U+0570><U+0561>, ''Urha'' in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], <U+039F><U+03C1><U+03C1><U+03B1>, ''Orrha'' in [[Greek language|Greek]] (also <U+039F><U+03C1><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03B1>, ''Orrhoa''). For a while it was named ''Callirrhoe'' or ''Antiochia on the Callirhoe'' (Greek: <U+0391><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03CC><U+03C7><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03B1> <U+03B7> <U+03B5><U+03C0><U+03AF> <U+039A><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03C1><U+03C1><U+03CC><U+03B7><U+03C2>). During [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule it was named ''Justinopolis''. Although it is often best known by the name given it by the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]], <U+0395><U+03B4><U+03B5><U+03C3><U+03C3><U+03B1>, ''Edessa''.

'<U+015E>anl<U+0131>' means ''great, glorious, dignified'' in Turkish and Urfa was officially re-named <U+015E>anl<U+0131>urfa (Urfa the Glorious) by the [[Turkish Grand National Assembly]] in [[1984]], in recognition of the local resistance in the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. The title was achieved following repeated requests by the city's members of parliament, desirous to earn a title similar to those of neihgbouring rival cities 'Gazi' (veteran) [[Antep]] and 'Kahraman' (Heroic) [[Mara<U+015F>]]. The delay in according the title can possibly be explained by the controversial attack by irregulars on the French troops withdrawing under an agreement.

==History==
The history of <U+015E>anl<U+0131>urfa dates as far back as [[8000 BC]], the temple of Nevali Cori and carvings dating back that far have been found. It was one of several cities in the [[Euphrates]]-[[Tigris]] basin, the cradle of the [[Mesopotamia]]n civilization.  According to [[Turkey|Turk]]ish [[Muslim]] traditions Urfa (its name since [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] days) is the biblical city of [[Ur]], due to its proximity to the biblical village of [[Harran]]. However, the Iraqis also claim the city of Ur in southern [[Iraq]], as do many historians and archeologists.

Urfa is also known as the birthplace of [[Abraham]], commemorated by a mosque in the city and the birthplace of [[Job_%28Biblical_figure%29 | Job]]. 

[[Image:Fish-ebrahim-turkey.jpg|thumb|right|250px| Traditionally, [[Nimrod (king)|Nimrod]] had [[Abraham]] immolated on a funeral pyre, but God turned the fire into water and the burning coals into fish]]

Urfa was conquered repeatedly throughout history, and has been dominated by many civilizations, including the [[Ebla]], [[Akkadians]], [[Sumerians]], [[Babylonians]], [[Hittites]], [[Hurris]], [[Mittannis]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Chaldeans]], [[Medes]], [[Persians]], [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] (under [[Alexander the Great]]), [[Seleucids]], [[Arameans]], [[Osrhoenes]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Sassanids]], Byzantines, [[Crusades|Crusaders]].

===The city of Edessa===
In the Byzantine period Edessa was a powerful regional centre, and a sophisticated city with churches, schools and monasteries.

'''For more on this please see the article [[Edessa, Mesopotamia]].'''

===The age of Islam===
[[Islam]] first arrived around [[639]] C.E., when the [[Umayyad]] army conquered the region without a fight. [[Islam]] was then established permanently in Urfa by the empires of the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]], [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] and [[Ottoman Turk]]s. 

Under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] Urfa was a centre of trade in [[cotton]], [[leather]], and [[jewellery]]. There were three Christian communities: [[Syrian Orthodox Church|Syrian]], [[Armenian Orthodox Church|Armenian]], and [[Roman Catholic Church|Latin]]. The last Syrian Christians left in 1924 and went to [[Aleppo]] (where they settled down in a place that later got called ''Hay Al Suryan'' "The Syrian Quarter").

===The First World War and after===
In 1914 Urfa  was estimated to have 75,000 inhabitants: 45,000 Turks, 25,000 Armenians and 5,000 Syrian Christians. There were also some Jews. During the last half of 1915 the Armenian community became increasingly worried about their fate, as Armenians were being moved out of lands to the north. Early in 1916 the Armenians in the city revolted and took control of the old quarters of the city. They fought off the Ottoman army for some weeks, standing up to an artillery bombardment. The German General [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz|Baron von der Goltz]] arrived and negotiated a settlement, the Armenians would surrender and disarm and in exchange the Ottomans would not deport them. However, the Ottoman government did deport the Armenians. Few survived. This is considered to be part of the [[Armenian Genocide]].

At the end of [[World War I]], with the [[Ottoman Empire]] defeated, and European armies attempting to grab parts of Anatolia, first the [[British Empire|British]] and then the [[France|French]] occupied Urfa. The British occupation of the city of [[<U+015E>anl<U+0131>urfa|Urfa]] started de facto on [[7 March]] [[1919]] and officially as of [[24 March]] [[1919]], and lasted till [[30 October]] [[1919]]. French forces took over the next day and their uncomfortable presence, met by outbursts of resistance, lasted until [[11 April]] [[1920]], when they were defeated by local resistance forces  (the new [[Turkey|Turkish]] government in [[Ankara]] not being established, with the National Assembly declared on [[23 April]] [[1920]].

The French retreat from the city of Urfa was conducted under an agreement reached between the occupying forces and the representatives of the local forces, commanded by Captain [[Ali Saip Bey]] assigned from Ankara. The withdrawal was meant to take place peacefully, but was disrupted by an ambush on the French by irregular forces at the <U+015E>ebeke Pass on the way to [[Syria]], leading to 296 casualties among the French, and more among the ambushers. 

==<U+015E>anl<U+0131>urfa today==
[[Image:Urfastreet.jpg|thumb|right|250px|<U+015E>anl<U+0131>urfa's old town contains many atmospheric backstreets.]]

[[Image:Urfaskyline.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The skyline of <U+015E>anl<U+0131>urfa as viewed from the Castle which dominates the City Centre.]]

Modern <U+015E>anl<U+0131>urfa presents stark contrasts between its old and new quarters. The old town is one of the most evocative and romantic in Turkey, with an ancient [[bazaar]] still visited by local people to buy fruit and vegetables, where traditionally dressed and scarfed [[Arab]] and [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] villagers arrive in the early morning to sell their produce. Much of the old town consists of traditional Middle Eastern houses built around courtyards, invisible from the dusty streets, many of which are impassible to motor vehicles. In the narrow streets of the bazaar people scurry to and fro carrying trays of food, which is eaten on newspapers spread on low tables in a corner of the little shops, many people drinking water from the same cup. This very oriental atmosphere is bewitching but below the surface parts of the old city are very poor indeed, with people still living in cave houses (built into the side of the rock). 

<U+015E>anl<U+0131>urfa's newer districts meanwhile, are a sprawl of modern concrete apartment blocks, with many surprisingly tidy leafy avenues, containing modern restaurants, sports facilities and other amenities with air-conditioning, a refuge from the roasting summer heat. 

===Politics===
In contrast to areas further to the East, although most residents are ethnically Kurdish and Kurdish is widely spoken, the local population is largely assimilated into Turkish society, and there is little political support for Kurdish nationalism. Urfa is regarded in Turkish popular sentiment as being, second only to [[Konya]], the most devout in Turkey and it is a stronghold of the governing [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]]. 

The strength of political Islam is perhaps partly due to Urfa's having an established population of ethnic [[Arab]]s, whose adherence to the traditions of Islam are naturally stronger than speakers of Turkish or Kurdish. (The traditional Middle-eastern hospitality is much in evidence, you will be offered tea by shopkeepers in Urfa). (Another Middle-eastern pastime, horse-racing is also popular in Urfa, where there is a hippodrome and a number of stud farms). 

Tragically, Urfa is also the scene of a large number of ''honour killings'', in which (typically) young women are murdered by members of their family  for crimes such as having a boyfriend.

===Food and drink===
The cuisine is typical of the south-east; bread and meat are at the centre either [[kebab]], [[doner]] or [[kavurma]] (fried meats or liver), with lots of use of aubergine, tomato  and hot pepper, including the legendary local red pepper [[isot]]. Other dishes include: the spicy appetiser [[<U+00E7>i<U+011F> k<U+00F6>fte]] (in Urfa even spicier than usual); the rich sweets such as the hot butter and syrup [[k<U+00FC>nefe]] or the walnut pastry ''sillik''; the bitter Arabic-style coffee ''m<U+0131>rra'' and  the coffee-like drink made from [[Terebinth]] ''menengi<U+00E7> kahvesi''. 
*(The legend of ''isot'' goes that during the French occupation in the 1920s the people of Urfa were at first not much concerned about the town being invaded or losing their homes and only began the resistance when they saw the French marching in the pepper fields. Now they even make isot flavoured ice-cream. 

Urfa is not a huge metropolis and in many ways feels like a conservative country town (albeit a largish one). You will not be served an alcoholic drink with your dinner in Urfa and even the tea-gardens (the only public social venue that Urfa provides) are strictly segregated for families or single-men (not the case in western Turkey for example).  One local tradition is the ''s<U+0131>ra gecesi'', where groups of men gather at home, especially in winter evenings, to play lutes ([[ud]] or [[ba<U+011F>lama]]) and sing folk songs. However today there are a couple of smart hotels where you can get a drink and with the new economic growth, plus the growing university, Urfa's social infrastructure must surely develop soon.

===Economy===
In this roasting climate the plains of Urfa and Harran are hot and dry. However since the early 1990s <U+015E>anl<U+0131>urfa has prospered on the back of the [[Southeastern Anatolia Project]], which has provided a reliable supply of water for local farmers and fostered and agricultural boom, including cotton production. This in turn is driving significant development of light industry in the city. Unemployment and poverty, while real problems, are on a smaller scale than in other eastern Turkish cities, and luxury automobiles can be seen on the streets of Urfa (incidentally one phenomena is common to many Eastern cities, the newer smarter cars usually carry Istanbul or Ankara number-plates not the local plate). The huge reservoir is also a spectacular sight, and now there are waterfront restaurants popping up.

*The birthplace of the prophet Abraham - a cave to the south of the city
*Urfa castle - built in antiquity, the current walls were constructed by the [[Abbasids]] in 814AD. 
*The legendary Pool of Sacred Fish (''Baliklig<U+00F6>l'') where Abraham was thrown into the fire by Nimrod. The pool is in the courtyard of the mosque of Halil-ur-Rahman, built by the [[Ayyubids]] in 1211 and now surrounded by attractive gardens designed by architect [[Merih Karaaslan]]. The fish are not a pretty sight as they thrash about frantically devouring bread thrown by visitors. But the courtyard is very peaceful and it is said that if you see a white fish you will go to heaven. 
*Rizvaniye Mosque - a more recent (1716) Ottoman mosque, adjoining the Baliklig<U+00F6>l complex.
*Ayn Zeliha - another pool nearby, named after a lady follower of Abraham.
*The Great Mosque of Urfa was built in [[1170]], on the site of a Christian church the Arabs called the "red church," probably incorporating some Roman masonry. Contemporary tradition at the site identifies the well of the mosque as that into which the towel (''mendil'') of the prophet Jesus was thrown (see [[Image of Edessa]]). In the south wall of the ''medrese'' adjoining the mosque is the fountain of Firuz Bey (1781).
*Ruins of the ancient city walls.
*Eight Turkish baths built in the [[Ottoman Empire | Ottoman]] period.
