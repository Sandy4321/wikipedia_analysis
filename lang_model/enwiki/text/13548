'''''Just a Minute''''' is a [[BBC Radio 4]] [[radio comedy]] and [[television]] [[panel game]] [[Master of Ceremonies|chaired]] by [[Nicholas Parsons]]. Its first transmission on Radio 4 was on 22 December 1967, three months after the station's launch.<ref>BBC Radio 4 was launched on 30 September 1967, around three months before ''Just a Minute'' was created.</ref> The Radio 4 programme won a Gold [[Sony Radio Academy Award]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioawards.org/winners03/win03_pfv.htm|title=2003 Winners|publisher=Sony Radio Academy Award|accessdate=2010-10-14 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041205211657/www.radioawards.org/winners03/win03_pfv.htm |archivedate=2004-12-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3012217.stm |accessdate=2010-10-14 |title= Sony Radio Awards 2003: Winners |publisher=BBC News |date=8 May 2003 }}</ref>

The object of the game is for panellists to talk for sixty seconds on a given subject, "without [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], [[wikt:pause|hesitation]] or [[wikt:deviation|deviation]]". The comedy comes from attempts to keep within these rules and the banter among the participants. In 2011 comedy writer [[David Quantick]] ascribed ''Just a Minute'''s success to its "insanely basic" format, stating, "It's so blank that it can be filled by people as diverse as [[Paul Merton]] and [[Graham Norton]], who don't have to adapt their style of humour to the show at all."<ref>''[[guardian.co.uk]]'', 17 May 2011, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/may/17/just-a-minute-stephen-fry Just a Minute: why it's never paused]</ref>

==History==
The idea for the game came to [[Ian Messiter]] as he rode on the top of a [[London Buses route 13|number 13]] bus. He recalled Percival Parry Jones, a history master from his days at [[Sherborne School]] who, upon seeing the young Messiter daydreaming in a class, instructed him to repeat everything he had said in the previous minute without hesitation or repetition.<ref name="BBC Entertainment article">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/534931.stm|title=Messiter's game show magic   | work=BBC News | date=1999-11-24 | accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref> To this, Messiter added a rule disallowing players from deviating from the subject, as well as a scoring system based on panellists' challenges.<ref name="Homepage">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/justaminute.shtml|title=Just a Minute|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2007-09-07}}</ref> 

The idea for the show was first used in ''One Minute Please'', chaired by [[Roy Plomley]]. Whilst the fundamental rules were the same, the game was played in two teams of three rather than with four individual contestants. The show was broadcast between 1951 and 1957.<ref name="UKGS">{{cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Just_a_Minute|title=Just a Minute|publisher=UK Game Shows.com|accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref> Previous incarnations of the programme included a 1952 version in [[South Africa]], as well as a television version on the [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont network]] in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/1999/nov/25/guardianobituaries1|title=Ian Messiter (obituary)|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref> 

A pilot for the show was recorded in 1967, featuring [[Clement Freud]], [[Derek Nimmo]], [[Beryl Reid]] and Wilma Ewart as panellists. The chairman was originally planned to be [[Jimmy Edwards]] but he was unavailable on the proposed recording dates and was replaced by [[Nicholas Parsons]]. Whilst executives at the BBC disliked the pilot, its producer, [[David Hatch]], threatened to resign if he could not oversee a full series. Not wishing to lose Hatch, the BBC acquiesced.<ref name="UKGS"/>

The show's theme music is [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin]]'s piano Waltz in D flat major, Op. 64, No. 1, nicknamed the "[[Minute Waltz]]" (which, despite its name, lasts longer than the 60 seconds taken to complete a round of ''Just a Minute'').

==Rules==
The four panellists are challenged to speak for one minute on a given subject (which they are not able to prepare for in advance) without "'''repetition, hesitation, or deviation'''". Over the years, the application of these rules has been inconsistent and is thus the focus of much of the comic interplay between those appearing on the programme as Parsons' rulings are challenged. In the first three series, the rules were more complicated and sometimes applied on a one-off basis <U+2014> a ban on the word "is" might apply in a round, for example. But the basic rules remain quite straightforward.

* "Repetition" means the repetition of any word or phrase, although challenges based upon very common words such as "and" are generally rejected except in extreme cases. Words contained in the given subject are exempt unless repeated many times in quick succession, although this exception was a later addition to the rules. Skilful players use synonyms in order to avoid repeating themselves. The term "BBC" can be successfully challenged for repetition of "B".
* "Hesitation" is watched very strictly: a momentary pause before resumption of the subject can give rise to a successful challenge, as can tripping over one's words. Even pausing during audience laughter or applause (known as "riding a laugh") can be challenged.
* "Deviation" means deviating from the subject, but has also been interpreted as "deviating from the English language as we know it", "deviation from grammar as we understand it", deviating from the truth, and deviation from logic, although leaps into the surreal are often allowed.

A panellist scores a point for making a correct challenge against whomever is speaking, while the speaker gets a point if the challenge is deemed incorrect. However, if a witty interjection amuses the audience, even though it is not a correct challenge, both the challenger and speaker may gain a point, at the chairman's discretion. A player who makes a correct challenge takes over the subject for the remainder of the minute, or until he or she is correctly challenged. The person speaking when the 60 seconds expires also scores a point. An extra point is awarded when a panellist speaks for the entire minute without being challenged.

It is unusual for a panellist to speak within the three cardinal rules for any substantial length of time, whilst remaining coherent, and also being amusing. Therefore, to speak for the full minute without being challenged is a special achievement. However, if a panellist is speaking fluently on a subject, staying reasonably within the three rules, and seems likely to speak for the whole minute, the other panellists will often refrain from buzzing in. On occasion a similar courtesy has also been extended by the whistle-blower, who will refrain from indicating the end of the minute so as to not interrupt a panellist in full and entertaining flow (this once led to Paul Merton's speaking for one minute and forty seconds on the topic "[[Ram-raiding]]").  

Below is an example of a speech given by [[Sheila Hancock]] which lasted for a full minute without being challenged. The subject was "How to win an argument".
<blockquote>"Well it varies according to the person that you are arguing with. Should it be a child that you are having a contretemps with, the ideal is deviation tactics. For instance Lola Lupin who I mentioned before won't eat her dinner. So what I do is say, "yes it is rotten food, let us sing a song", making sure that that particular chanson has a few vowels in it that require her to open her mouth! During which I pop the spoon in and I have won the argument. However if it is an argument with a person that knows their subject what I do is nod sagely and smile superciliously, let them ramble on, and at the end I say "well I'm sorry, I think you're completely wrong", turn on my heels and leave. I..."<ref>{{cite episode|title=Episode 633|series=Just a Minute|airdate=2005-07-25|season=50|episode=3}}</ref></blockquote>

On rare occasions, panellists will challenge themselves, usually by mistake or for laughs.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Episode 436|series=Just a Minute|airdate=1994-01-15|season=30|episode=3}}</ref> The game rewards those who make entertaining challenges, even if they do not speak for very long. If successful, last-second challenges can be especially rewarding, as they allow one to speak for a short time but earn two points&mdash;one for the challenge and one for being the last speaker. 

The game is then scored and a winner declared, but the attraction of the show lies less in the contest than in the humour and banter among participants and the chairman. 


==Participants==
[[Image:Clement-freud-368-220.JPG|thumb|left|[[Clement Freud]] was a panelist on the show from 1967 to 2009, making him the longest-serving guest.]]
Nicholas Parsons has chaired the show since its inception. On nine occasions he has appeared on the panel, and others have acted as chairman including [[Clement Freud]], Geraldine Jones, [[Andr<U+00E9>e Melly]] and [[Kenneth Williams]]. Ian Messiter was chairman on one occasion in 1977, when Freud arrived late and Nicholas Parsons took his place on the panel.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Episode 230|series=Just a Minute|airdate=1977-01-12|season=11|episode=11}}</ref> Parsons has appeared on every show, either as chairman or panellist.

Each programme features four panellists, with the exception of six shows in 1968 and another at the end of the 1970<U+2013>1971 season when there were three.

Until 1989, Ian Messiter sat on the stage with a stopwatch and blew a whistle when the speaker's minute was up (originally a cuckoo). He was replaced by a series of different whistle-blowers. Sarah Sharpe is the current incumbent. Messiter continued to be involved with the show, setting the subjects until his death in 1999.

There have been five regular competitors in the show's history: [[Clement Freud]], [[Peter Jones (actor)|Peter Jones]], [[Derek Nimmo]], [[Kenneth Williams]] and [[Paul Merton]]. Freud and Nimmo appeared from the first programme in 1967, while Williams joined in the show's second series in 1968. Jones made his d<U+00E9>but in 1971. After Williams' death in 1988, Merton (a long-time fan of the show) contacted the producer at Nicholas Parsons' suggestion and was invited to participate during the following year.<ref>''Clement Freud on Just a Minute: A Celebration'', BBC Radio 4, 26 May 2009</ref> Nimmo died in 1999, Jones in 2000 and Freud in 2009, leaving Merton as the only regular panellist, albeit not in every show. 
[[Image:Just a Minute.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nicholas Parsons]] during a show recording at the Pleasance Grand, Edinburgh.]]
Each of the regulars brought their individual style to playing the game. Clement Freud liked to list examples and to challenge with only a few seconds to go. He was among the show's more competitive players, regularly referring to the rules and deprecating any deviation from them. Derek Nimmo frequently improvised descriptions of his experiences abroad, often on theatrical tour. He also was highly competitive and berated the chairman frequently. Peter Jones once said that in all his years of playing the game, he never quite got the hang of it, though his self-deprecating, laconic style suited the essential silliness of the game. Kenneth Williams was often the star of the show: his flamboyant tantrums, arch put-downs, and mock sycophancy made him the audience's favourite. Williams often stretched out his speeches by extending every syllable to breaking point (some words lasting for up to three seconds), and his regular mock-anger often included the complaint, "I've come all the way from [[Great Portland Street]]", which was close to where the show was recorded.<ref name="H2G2">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A330797|title=H2G2 - Just a Minute|publisher=BBC|date=2000-06-30|accessdate=2007-09-11}}</ref> Merton frequently launches into flights of fancy, such as claiming to have had unusual occupations or to have experienced significant historical events. He also often wins points by challenging just before the whistle or for humorous challenges.<ref name="H2G2"/>

Over the 45-year history of the show, there have been many other panellists. Those to have appeared frequently <U+2014> more than 20 times each <U+2014> are [[Gyles Brandreth]], [[Julian Clary]], [[Barry Cryer]], [[Jenny Eclair]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Sheila Hancock]], [[Tony Hawks]], [[Kit Hesketh-Harvey]], [[Aimi MacDonald]], [[Andree Melly]], [[Chris Neill]], [[Ross Noble]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Sue Perkins]], [[Tim Rice]], [[Wendy Richard]], [[Linda Smith (comedian)|Linda Smith]] and [[Liza Tarbuck]].

==Recording locations==
The first show in 1967 was recorded in the Playhouse Theatre in central London, and the 35th anniversary show was also recorded there, and broadcast on New Year's Day 2003.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Episode 1|series=Just a Minute|airdate=1967-12-22|season=1|episode=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title=Episode 577, 35th Anniversary Special|series=Just a Minute|airdate=2003-01-01|season=45|episode=1}}</ref>

Most shows in the first 30 years were recorded in the [[Paris Theatre]] in central London. In 1992, the then-new producer, Sarah Smith, took the show outside central London and recorded some shows in nearby [[Highgate]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Episode 415|series=Just a Minute|airdate=1992-01-04|season=28|episode=1}}</ref> A year later, the show left Greater London for the first time; the first such shows broadcast were recorded in [[Bury St. Edmunds]] and [[Llandudno]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Episode 424|series=Just a Minute|airdate=1993-01-02|season=29|episode=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title=Episode 426|series=Just a Minute|airdate=1993-01-16|season=29|episode=3}}</ref> The show started going to the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in 1993 and has been there every year since.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Episode 445|series=Just a Minute|airdate=1994-12-31|season=31|episode=2}}</ref> Currently most shows, though not all, are recorded at the BBC Radio Theatre in [[Broadcasting House]] in central London. 

In February 2012, two episodes of the show were recorded at the Comedy Store, in Mumbai in India, the first time the show has recorded outside Britain. The programme played for many years on the World Service and is said to have a large following in India.<ref>{{cite web|author=13:00 - 13:30 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/just-a-minute/india/ |title=Radio 4 - Just a Minute's Indian Adventure |publisher=BBC |date=2012-03-13 |accessdate=2012-05-13}}</ref>

==TV versions==
Several television versions have been attempted. Two pilot episodes were recorded for [[television]] in 1969 and 1981 but never broadcast, except in documentaries about Kenneth Williams. 

In 1994, 14 shows were broadcast on [[Carlton Television]], [[ITV]] in London. Two additional variations were added: a round in which the team were presented with a mystery object to talk about, rather than a subject, and another round where the audience suggested a topic. Nicholas Parsons chaired the show, and Tony Slattery featured in all programmes. Other panellists were [[Tony Banks, Baron Stratford|Tony Banks]], [[Tony Blackburn]], [[Jo Brand]], Ann Bryson, [[John Fortune]], Clement Freud, [[Mariella Frostrup]], Jeremy Hardy, Tony Hawks, [[Hattie Hayridge]], Kit Hesketh-Harvey, Helen Lederer, Pete McCarthy, Neil Mullarkey, Derek Nimmo, Graham Norton, Nick Revell, [[Ted Robbins]], Lee Simpson, Arthur Smith, Jim Sweeney and Richard Vranch.

In 1995, fourteen more episodes were broadcast. ''Just a Minute'' became a team game, with the Midlands and London playing against each other, under team captains Tony Slattery and [[Dale Winton]]. Each player earned individual points, which were totalled for each team at the end of the show. Nicholas Parsons again chaired the shows. The gimmick of the audience choosing a subject was abandoned in this series. Other panellists were Tony Banks, Tony Blackburn, [[Craig Charles]], Clement Freud, Mariella Frostrup, Liza Goddard, Jeremy Hardy, Kit Hesketh-Harvey, Helen Lederer, Carolyn Marshall, Graham Norton, [[Su Pollard]], Wendy Richard, Arthur Smith, Jim Sweeney and Richard Vranch. Both this series and the series before were produced by [[Mike Mansfield (producer)|Mike Mansfield]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0543809/|title=Mike Mansfield |work=[[IMDB]]}}</ref>

In 1999, the [[BBC]] televised the show, with 20 episodes recorded during a single week in Birmingham. Nicholas Parsons was again the chairman. There were no regular panellists but those appearing were Pam Ayres, [[Clare Balding]], [[Isla Blair]], Jo Brand, Gyles Brandreth, [[Ken Bruce]], [[Michael Cashman]], Barry Cryer, Stephen Frost, Liza Goddard, Tony Hawks, Peter Jones, Maria McErlane, Richard Morton, [[Tom O'Connor (comedian)|Tom O'Connor]], Su Pollard, [[Steve Punt]], Wendy Richard, John Sergeant, [[Brian Sewell]], Linda Smith, Richard Vranch and [[Gary Wilmot]]. The series was produced by Helena Taylor.

In March and April 2012, the BBC broadcast 10 episodes, recorded over a week at the BBC Television Centre in London. The shows were said to mark the 45th anniversary of the programme. For the first time, the shows were shown in prime time at 6pm each night over two weeks on BBC Two. Nicholas Parsons again chaired the programme and Paul Merton appeared in all episodes. No changes were made to the format of the game. The shows were produced by Andy Brereton and Jamie Ormerod.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/00000654/just_a_minute_tv_adaptation/|accessdate=2011-10-21|title=Just A Minute to be adapted for TV for 45th anniversary|date=20 October 2011}}</ref>

==Other formats==
A Swedish version of the show, called ''[[P<U+00E5> Minuten]]'', has been broadcast on [[Sveriges Radio]] [[P1 (Swedish radio station)|P1]] since 1969.
