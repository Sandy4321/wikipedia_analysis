'''Equity''' is the name given to the set of [[law|legal]] principles, in countries following the [[English Law|English common law]] tradition, which supplement strict rules of law where their application would operate harshly, so as to achieve what is sometimes referred to as "natural justice." It is often confusingly contrasted with "law", which in this context refers to "[[statutory law]]" (the laws enacted by a [[legislature]], such as [[Parliament]]), and "[[common law]]" (the principles established by judges when they decide cases).

In modern practice, perhaps the most important distinction between law and equity is the set of remedies each offers.  The most common remedy a court of law can award is money damages.  Equity, however, enters injunctions or decrees directing someone either to act or to forbear from acting.  Often this form of relief is in practical terms more valuable to a litigant.  A plaintiff whose neighbor will not return his only milk cow, which wandered onto the neighbor's property, for example, may want that particular cow back and not just its monetary value.  However, in general, a litigant cannot obtain equitable relief unless there is "no adequate remedy at law"<U+2014>that is, a court will not grant an injunction unless monetary damages are an insufficient remedy for the injury in question.  Law courts also enter orders, called "[[writ]]s" (such as a writ of [[habeas corpus]]) but they are less flexible and less easily obtained than an [[injunction]]. 

Another distinction is the unavailability of a jury in equity, where the judge is the [[trier of fact]]. In the American legal system, the right of [[jury trial]] in civil cases tried in federal court is guaranteed by the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]], but only "[i]n Suits at common law," i.e., in cases that traditionally would have been handled by the law courts.  The question of whether a case should be determined by a jury depends largely on the type of relief the plaintiff requests. If a plaintiff requests damages in the form of money or certain other forms of relief, such as the return of a specific item of property, the remedy is considered legal, and a jury is available as the fact-finder.  On the other hand, if the plaintiff requests an [[injunction]], [[declaratory judgment]], [[specific performance]] or modification of contract, or other non-monetary relief, the claim would usually be one in equity.

A final important distinction between law and equity is the source of the rules governing the decisions.  In law, decisions are made by reference to legal doctrines or [[statutes]].  In contrast, equity, with its emphasis on fairness and flexibility, has only general guides known as the [[maxims of equity]].  As noted below, a historic criticism of equity as it developed was that it had no fixed rules of its own, with the [[Lord Chancellor]] from time to time judging in the main according to his own conscience.  As time went on the rules of equity did lose their flexibility and from the [[17th Century]] onwards equity was rapidly consolidated into a system of precedents much like its cousin [[common law]]. 

[[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Bleak House]]'' [[parody|parodied]] the excessive time and expense associated with the Court of Equity in 19th century [[England]].

==History==

The distinction between "law" and "equity" is an accident of [[history]]. The "law courts" or "courts of law" were the courts all over [[England]] that enforced the king's laws in medieval times. At the end of the [[13th century]] the courts of law gradually froze the types of claims they would hear, and the procedure that governed the hearing of those claims.  Because the range of legal claims at that time was quite narrow, legal procedures were painfully hypertechnical, with the result that many deserving plaintiffs were denied relief.  

However, remedies could also be obtained through filing a [[petition]] with the king, who held residual judicial power; these filings were usually phrased in terms of throwing oneself upon the king's mercy or conscience.  Eventually, the king began to regularly delegate the function of resolving such petitions to the [[Chancellor]], an important member of the King's Council.  At the time, the Chancellor was usually a clergyman and the King's confessor, so he was literally the keeper of the King's conscience. Soon the [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]], the Crown's secretarial department, began to resemble a judicial body and became known as the "Court of Chancery".

By the [[15th century]], the judicial power of the Chancery was recognised. Equity, as a body of rules, varied from Chancellor to Chancellor, until the end of the [[16th century]]. After the end of the [[17th century]], only lawyers were appointed to the office of Chancellor.

One area in which the Court of Chancery assumed a vital role was the enforcement of [[use (legal)|use]]s, a role which the rigid framework of [[land law]] could not accommodate. This role gave rise to the basic distinction between legal and equitable interests.

===Development of equity in England===

It was early provided that, in seeking to remove one who wrongfully entered another's land with force and arms, a person could allege disseisin (dispossession) and demand (and pay for) a writ of entry. That writ not only gave him the written right to re-enter his own land, but it also established this right under the protection of [[the Crown]] if need be, whence its value. In 1253, to prevent judges from inventing new writs, [[Parliament]] provided that the power to issue writs would thereafter be transferred to judges only one writ at a time, in a "writ for right" package known as a form of action. However, because it was limited to enumerated writs for enumerated rights and wrongs, the writ system sometimes produced unjust results. Thus, even though the King's Bench might have jurisdiction over a case and might have the power to issue the perfect writ, the plaintiff might still not have a case if there was not a single form of action combining them. Therefore, lacking a legal remedy, the plaintiff's only option would be petitioning the King. 

People started petitioning the King for relief against unfair judgments and as the number of petitioners rapidly grew, the King delegated the task of hearing petitions to the Lord Chancellor.  The first Chancellors were [[clergy|men of the cloth]], and they were required to pass judgment guided by conscience and based on morals and equality.  It has been suggested that ecclesiastics were chosen for this position as they belonged to the small class of people who were able to read and write.

As these Chancellors had no formal legal training, and were not guided by precedent, their decisions were often widely diverse. However, in 1529 a lawyer, Sir [[Thomas More]], was appointed as Chancellor, marking the beginning of a new era.  After this time, all future Chancellors were lawyers, and from around 1557 onwards, records of proceedings in the Courts of Chancery were kept, leading to the development of a number of equitable doctrines. Criticisms continued. The 17th century Jurist John Selden once said that <U+201C>equity varies with the length of the Chancellor<U+2019>s foot<U+201D>.

As the law of equity developed, it began to rival and conflict with the common law.  Litigants would go <U+2018>jurisdiction shopping<U+2019> and often would seek an equitable injunction prohibiting the enforcement of a common law court order.  The penalty for disobeying an equitable <U+2018>common injunction<U+2019> and enforcing a common law judgment was imprisonment.

The Chief Justice of the King<U+2019>s Bench, Sir [[Edward Coke]] began the practice of issuing writs of habeas corpus that required the release of people imprisoned for contempt of chancery orders.

This tension grew to an all-time high in the Earl of Oxford<U+2019>s case (1615), where a judgment of Coke CJ was allegedly obtained by fraud.  The Lord Chancellor, [[Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley|Lord Ellesmere]], issued a common injunction out of the Chancery prohibiting the enforcement of the common law order.  The two courts became locked in a stalemate, and the matter was eventually referred to the Attorney-General, Sir [[Francis Bacon]].  Sir Francis, by authority of [[James I of England|King James I]], upheld the use of the common injunction and concluded that in the event of any conflict between the common law and the equity, equity would prevail. Equity's primacy in England was later enshrined in the Judicature Acts of the 1870s, which also served to fuse the courts of equity and the common law (although emphatically not the systems themselves) into one unified court system.

Once equity became a body of law, rather than an arbitrary exercise of conscience there was no reason why it needed its own courts. Consequently the Judicature Act was established, which is the basis of the court structure in England to this date, and that there would no longer be different procedures for seeking equitable and common law remedies. The Judicature Acts fused only the [[administration]] of common law and equity; there is still a body of rules of equity which is quite distinct from that of common law rules, and acts as an addition to it. Although they are implemented by the same courts, the two branches of the law are separate. Where there is conflict, equity still prevails.

===Statute of Uses 1535===

In order to avoid paying land taxes and other feudal dues, lawyers developed a primitive form of trust called <U+2018>the use<U+2019>.  This trust enabled one person (who was not required to pay tax) to hold the legal title of the land for the use of another person.  The effect of this trust was that the first person owned the land under the common law, but the second person had a right to use the land under the law of equity.

Henry VIII enacted the [[Statute of Uses]] in 1535 (which became effective in 1536) in an attempt to outlaw this practice and recover lost revenue.  The Act effectively made the beneficial owner of the land the legal owner, and liable for feudal dues.

The response of the lawyers to this Statute was to create the <U+2018>use upon a use<U+2019>.  The Statute recognised only the first use, and so land owners were again able to separate the legal and beneficial interests in their land.

== Comparison of equity traditions in common law countries ==
{{Original research|date=November 2007}}
As with the geographical transmission of any cultural artifact, direct English influence over equity weakened with time and distance. However, the widespread import of printed opinions provided a corrective force, however long delayed. As the colonies gained political independence, each of their legal systems began drifting from the original in an irreversible departure from the English way of making laws and deciding cases. Nonetheless, each former colony acknowledged the reception the common law and equity of England as a vital source of their jurisprudence. 

The comparative question is an easy one to pose. Did English equity develop maturity early enough that all of its derivative systems necessarily tended toward the same doctrines because based on exactly the same set of general principles? Or did the split-offs of any of the colonies occur somewhere in the middle of its development so that substantial permanent differences resulted? One equity? or many?

The answer generally accepted in America, the earliest of the English colonies to gain independence, is the former, that the outcome of a case to be decided today upon principles of equity should be expected to be substantially the same whether decided in the UK or the US. The reasonableness of the belief enjoys strong historical support.

The perfection of modern equity as a system has been authoritatively credited to [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke]] who served as Chancellor 1737-1756.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

=== United States ===

[[Thomas Jefferson]] explained in 1785 that there are three main limitations on the power of a court of equity:

{{cquote|1. That it cannot take cognisance of any case wherein the common law can give complete remedy.<br> 2. That it cannot interpose in any case against the express letter and intention of the legislature. If the legislature means to enact an injustice, however palpable, the court of Chancery is not the body with whom a correcting power is lodged. <br>3. That it shall not interpose in any case which does not come within a general description and admit of redress by a general and practicable rule.<ref>[http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/Jefferson0136/Works/Vol04/HTMLs/0054-04_Pt05_1785.html#hd_lf054.04.head.147 Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Phillip Mazzei], November 1785.</ref>}}

In the [[United States]] today, the federal courts and most state courts have merged law and equity in the courts of general jurisdiction, such as county courts. However, the substantive distinction between law and equity has retained its old vitality.<ref>See, e.g., Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc., [http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-260.pdf  No. 05<U+2013>260], slip op. (U.S. May 15, 2006) (Roberts, C.J. for a unanimous court) (reviewing the scope of equitable relief as authorized by the ERISA statute).</ref> This difference is not a mere technicality, because the successful handling of certain law cases is difficult or impossible unless a temporary restraining order (TRO) or preliminary injunction is issued at the outset, to restrain someone from fleeing the jurisdiction taking the only property available to satisfy a judgment, for instance.

Equity courts were widely distrusted in the northeastern U.S. following the American Revolution, and the northern states eliminated their equity courts by the late 1700s. However, the mid-Atlantic and southern states were slower to abandon their equity courts. The federal courts did not abandon the old law/equity separation until the promulgation of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] in 1938.

Even today, a number of states still have separate courts for law and equity. [[Delaware]] is one notable example, as its [[Delaware Court of Chancery|Court of Chancery]] is where most cases involving [[Delaware corporation]]s are decided.  Some other states (such as Illinois and [[New Jersey]]) have separate divisions for legal and equitable matters in a single court.  Besides [[corporate law]], which developed out of the [[Trust law|law of trusts]], areas traditionally handled by chancery courts included [[Will (law)|wills]] and [[probate]], [[adoption]]s and [[guardianship]]s, and [[marriage]] and [[divorce]].  

After U.S. courts merged law and equity, American law courts adopted many of the procedures of equity courts.  The procedures in a court of equity were much more flexible than the courts at common law. In American practice, certain devices such as [[joinder]], [[counterclaim]], [[cross-claim]] and [[interpleader]] originated in the courts of equity.  Also, the modern [[class action]] evolved out of joinder.
