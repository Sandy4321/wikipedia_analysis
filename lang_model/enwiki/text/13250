'''Rush Street''' is a northbound [[one-way street]] in the [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago]] in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]]. It runs northbound from 401 North and 65 East to 1138 North and 0 E in the [[Streets and highways of Chicago|Chicago street address system]], making it slightly less than a [[mile]] long.<ref name=SCRS/> It runs parallel to and one block west of the [[Magnificent Mile]] on the [[two-way street|two-way traffic street]] North [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]], which runs at 100 east up to 950 north.<ref name=SCMA>Hayner, Don and Tom McNamee, ''Streetwise Chicago'', "Michigan Avenue/Michigan Avenue (Pvt.)", p. 87., Loyola University Press, 1988, ISBN 0-8294-0597-6</ref> The street, which is also one block east of the one-way southbound Wabash Avenue, formerly ran slightly further south to the [[Chicago River]] where over time various bridges connected it to the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]]. The street is currently known for its nightlife, especially at the northern end, but was an integral part of the city as a main river crossing at the southern end from the mid-1800s until the 1920s. However, the [[Michigan Avenue Bridge]] has taken over this role for this neighborhood.

==Background==
[[Image:Benjamin_Rush_Painting_by_Peale_1783.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Benjamin Rush|Dr. Benjamin Rush]] by [[Charles Willson Peale]], 1783]]
The street was named after Dr. [[Benjamin Rush]], one of the four physician signators of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. It is one of several places named after Dr. Rush in Chicago; other such places are [[Rush Medical College]] and [[Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center]].<ref name=SCRS>Hayner, Don and Tom McNamee, ''Streetwise Chicago'', "Rush Street", p. 112., Loyola University Press, 1988, ISBN 0-8294-0597-6</ref>

As part of the original incorporated city of Chicago in 1837,<ref>Chicago Fact Book Consortium (ed.), "Local Community Fact Book Chicago Metropolitan Area 1990," p. 57, 1995, ISBN 0-914091-60-3.</ref> Rush Street is one of the city's oldest thoroughfares.<ref name=LWARS3>Clark, p. 3</ref> Early Rush Street was a commonly agreed desirable place of residence and hosted the first house designed by an [[architect]] in Chicago (designed for the first [[Mayor of Chicago]] [[William Butler Ogden|William Ogden]] by [[J.M. Van Osdel]]).<ref name=LWARS3/> The house was bounded by Erie, Ontario, Rush and Cass (now Wabash Avenue) Streets, but did not survive the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871.

After the Great Chicago Fire, the Near North Side became a refuge for many due to its wide streets, high ground, good drainage, proximity to both the [[Lake Michigan]] lakeshore and [[Lincoln Park (Chicago)|Lincoln Park]]. In fact, [[Cyrus McCormick]] built a mansion at 675 Rush Street between 1875 and 1879.<ref name=LWARS8>Clark, p. 8</ref> The mansion, located at the corner of Rush and Erie, lured so many relatives to move nearby that the neighborhood became known as "McCormickville" by the 1880s.<ref> Stamper, p. xix.</ref><ref name=LWARS6>Clark, p. 6</ref> The street subsequently hosted some of the most elite Chicago socialites.<ref name=LWARS6/>

In the 1950's, the [[Chicago City Council]] began to use the Uniform Vehicle Code of 1931 to fight traffic congestion by creating [[one-way street]]s.  This was most effectively used in the Loop and Near North Side community areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1210.html|accessdate=2007-09-24|title=Streets, One-Way|author=Miller, Christopher|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date= 2005|publisher= Chicago Historical Society}}</ref>  Rush Street and most of the neighboring Near North Side streets remain one-way today.

In the 1960s, Rush Street was the center of the Chicago nightlife as home to many great [[Caberet|caberet]]s, [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s, [[Nightclub|club]]s and [[restaurant]]s.  However, many of the bars migrated north to [[Division Street]] as the street gentrified.<ref>''Frommer's Irreverent Guide to Chicago (sixth edition),'' 2007, p. 167, Wiley Publishing, Hoboken, NJ, ISBN 0-470-04079-3.</ref>  Rush street still has a reputation for its [[singles bar]]s, although its glory days have passed. Currently, the late night establishments mostly lure suburbanites, tourists, and young partygoers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/chicago/0006023899.html|accessdate=2007-09-12|title=Chicago: The Lounge & Bar Scene|publisher=Wiley Publishing, Inc.|work=Frommer's|date=2007}}</ref> Some still refer to it as the "hippest strip" in Chicago, with specific kudos to the part between [[Oak Street (Chicago)|Oak Street]] and [[Chicago Avenue]].<ref name=RSCST>{{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/dropzone/31666,wkp-news-dropzone112.article|accessdate=2007-09-12|title=Rush Street|author=Thomas, Mike|work=Chicago Sun-Times|publisher=Sun-Times News Group}}</ref> It continues to be the destination where visiting conventioners in pursuit of Chicago [[nightlife]] are brought by [[Taxicab|taxi]] as well as a preferred place for thirtysomething singles to congregate at night, especially in the summer.<ref name=MRWGC/><ref>McHugh, Rich (eds.

==Geography==
Rush Street runs partly north-south and partly in a north-northwest direction (see map in external links). It runs north-south at 65 east from 401 south at Kinzie to 800 north at [[Chicago Avenue]] between Michigan Avenue to the east at 100 east and Wabash Avenue to the west at 44 east. On the north side of Chicago it runs straight on a slight diagonal to the street grid. By the time it travels three blocks north to Delaware Place at 900 north, it intersects Wabash.<ref name=SCDP>Hayner, Don and Tom McNamee, ''Streetwise Chicago'', "Delaware Place", p. 31., Loyola University Press, 1988, ISBN 0-8294-0597-6</ref> It then continues on a diagonal for four more blocks where it intersects the north-south running [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]] (the centerline between east and west)<ref name=SCSS>Hayner, Don and Tom McNamee, ''Streetwise Chicago'', "State Street", p. 120., Loyola University Press, 1988, ISBN 0-8294-0597-6</ref> at Cedar Street which runs at 1120 north.<ref name=SCCS>Hayner, Don and Tom McNamee, ''Streetwise Chicago'', "Cedar Street", p. 21., Loyola University Press, 1988, ISBN 0-8294-0597-6</ref>

==Bridge==
[[Image:20070913 Rush Street Swing Bridge beyond Wrigley Building.JPG|thumb|right|150px|[[Wrigley Building]] with the Rush Street Bridge (1921).]]  
The main stem of the [[Chicago River]] has been crossed by four [[bridge]]s at Rush Street. The first bridge was a [[floating bridge]] that was hinged to one bank. Ropes were used to open and close this bridge.<ref name=S243>Stamper, p. 243.</ref> A March 1849 ice storm was the first of two instances in which all bridges on the main stem of the Chicago River were destroyed overnight. An iron and timber [[swing bridge]] with center supports was built in 1857 at a cost of [[United States dollar|$]]48,000. The bridge stood until, on [[November 3]] [[1863]], a passing ship's whistle spooked a herd of [[cattle]] that were crowding the bridge and stampeded into the river.<ref name=EOCRSB1>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/300041.html|accessdate=2007-09-12|title=City of Bridges: Rush Street Bridges (page 1)|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|work=Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005}}</ref> The bridge was repaired and still in use on [[October 8]] [[1871]] when it was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire. In 1872 the Detroit Bridge and Iron Works company built a [[wrought-iron]] replacement that stood until 1883, when a [[barge]] struck and collapsed the bridge.<ref name=S243/> It was replaced by another swing bridge that lasted for several decades until after the [[Michigan Avenue Bridge]] was built in 1920.<ref name=EOCRSB1/> This final 1884 bridge had [[truss]]es measuring {{ft to m|30}} in the center and {{ft to m|20}} on the ends. Its deck used 4-inch [[white pine]] planks.<ref name=S243/>

Prior to the Michigan Avenue bridge (pictured left), vehicular traffic crossed the river at Rush and traveled up to Ontario Street before heading east to Pine Street (now North Michigan Avenue after mulitple renamings).<ref name=LWARS4>Clark, p. 4</ref> There were several plans starting in the 1880s for improving Michigan Avenue that involved Rush Street, but nothing came of any of them.<ref>Stamper, p. 2.</ref> The final Rush Street Bridge was not designed for [[automobile]] traffic, which caused congestion on the south bank of the River where both Michigan and Wabash fed onto River Street (now [[Wacker Drive]]). In May 1904, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' declared that the {{Ft to m|36}} wide Rush Street Bridge, which handled approximately 50% of the north-south traffic in the city, was unfit for the contemporary pedestrian and vehicular traffic.<ref>Stamper, pp. 3-4.</ref> Thus [[Daniel Burnham]]'s [[1909 Plan of Chicago]] called for the replacement of the bridge with a new bridge at Michigan Avenue and the redevelopment of Wacker Drive. The bridge was quickly removed after the completion of the new Michigan Avenue Bridge.<ref name=EOCRSB2>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/300091.html|accessdate=2007-09-12|title=City of Bridges: Rush Street Bridges (page 2)|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|work=Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005}}</ref>
