'''Charles William 'C.W.' Dickey''' (born 6 July 1871 in [[Alameda, California]], died 25 April 1942 in [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu, Hawai{{okina}}i]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[architect]] famous for developing a distinctive style of [[Hawaiian architecture]].<ref name="Honolulu79">{{cite web |url= http://www2.hawaii.edu/~charlot/John%20WEB%20HON/HON%20Dickey%20copy.pdf |title= Architect of Inside-Outside Living |work=Honolulu |date= July 1979 }}</ref><ref name="DLNR">{{cite web |url=http://hawaii.gov/dlnr/hpd/hpcal84.htm |title=The Architecture of C.W. Dickey: Evolution of a Hawaiian Style |work=DLNR Historic Sites Calendar, 1984 |accessdate=2009-04-01 }}</ref> He was known not only for designing some of the most famous buildings in Hawai{{okina}}i&mdash;such as the [[Alexander & Baldwin Building]], [[Halekulani Hotel]], [[Kamehameha Schools]] campus buildings&mdash;but also for influencing a cadre of notable successors, including [[Hart Wood]], Cyril Lemmon, Douglas Freeth, Roy Kelley, and [[Vladimir Ossipoff]].<ref>Neil 1975, pp. 101-102</ref> 

==Life==
Dickey's maternal grandfather, [[William P. Alexander]], was an early [[List of Missionaries to Hawaii|missionary to Hawaii]]. His mother was Anne Alexander (1843<U+2013>1940), whose brother [[Samuel Thomas Alexander]] founded [[Alexander & Baldwin]] with [[ Henry Perrine Baldwin]] who was married to his aunt Emily Alexander. His father was Charles Henry Dickey (1841<U+2013>1932). He grew up in [[Haiku-Pauwela, Hawaii|Ha{{okina}}ik<U+016B>]] on [[Maui]], but he returned to the United States for schooling. After finishing [[high school]] in [[Oakland, California]], he obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in architecture from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1894, then worked with [[Clinton Briggs Ripley]] (1896-1900) and [[Edgar Allen Poe Newcomb|E.A.P. Newcomb]] (1901-1905) in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]], before returning to open his own firm in Oakland.<ref name="DLNR" />

==Work==
His initial designs in Hawai{{okina}}i were eclectic. Influences of the then popular [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style can be seen in [[Punahou School]]'s Pauahi Hall (1894-96), the Bishop Estate Building on Merchant Street (1896), the Irwin Block (Nippu Jiji building) on Nuuanu Street (1896),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2003/11/30/travel/index2.html |title=Building was home for Japanese newspaper |date=30 November 2003 |author=Burl Burlingame |accessdate=2009-05-17 |work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin }}</ref> and Progress Block on Fort Street (1897) in [[Downtown Honolulu]], the last now occupied by [[Hawaii Pacific University]]. One of his finest early designs was the [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] [[Stangenwald Building]] (1901) on Merchant Street. Many of these are [[contributing properties]] to the [[Merchant Street Historic District]].<ref name="focus">{{cite web |title= Merchant Street Historic District nomination form |author= Robert M. Fox |work= National Register of Historic Places |date= September 22, 1972 |publisher= U.S. National Park Service |url= http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/73000661.pdf |accessdate= 2010-03-10 }}</ref> 

Even while in Oakland, Dickey continued to design for clients in Hawai{{okina}}i. In 1920, he reopened an office in Honolulu, in partnership with Hart Wood, and then returned for good in 1925. This time he felt a stronger need to adapt his buildings to the local environment, declaring in 1926: "Hawaiian architecture is a type distinctive to itself and Mediterranean styles must be adapted to fit local conditions before they are at all suited to the islands." He favored larger open spaces and fewer walls, to allow the tradewinds to circulate, and roofs with projecting eaves in order to keep rain out without having to close the windows.<ref name="DLNR" />

The shape of the roof and the projecting eaves became such a Dickey trademark that it became known locally as the "Dickey roof": a [[hip roof]] with a "double-pitch", that is, a shallower [[roof pitch|pitch]] at the eaves, as can be seen on the house he constructed in 1926.<ref name="DLNR" /> So many other architects have adapted this roof style over the years that it has now become a stereotypical feature of a "Hawaiian sense of place."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.honolulumagazine.com/Honolulu-Magazine/February-2004/Not-Another-Dickey-Roof/ |title=Not Another Dickey Roof! Is "a Hawaiian sense of place" ruining local architecture? |work=Honolulu |date= February 2004 }}</ref>

During the 1920s, Dickey designed guest cottages in [[Waikiki]] for the [[Halekulani Hotel]] that attempted to replicate the charm of Hawaiian grass houses. In 1930 he completed the hotel's Honeymoon Cottage, and in 1931 its main building.<ref>Penkiunas 1990, pp. 245-246</ref> He designed the [[Waikiki Theatre]] in 1936.  In 1940 he designed another new hotel at the edge of the [[K<U+012B>lauea]] volcano for Greek businessman [[George Lycurgus]] called the [[Volcano House]].<ref>Neil 1975, p. 112</ref>
