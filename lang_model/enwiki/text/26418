'''HMS ''Agincourt''''' was a [[dreadnought]] built in the early 1910s. The ship was originally ordered by [[Brazil]], but the collapse of the [[rubber boom]] plus a lessening of the rivalry with [[Argentina]] led to her resale while still under construction to the [[Ottoman Empire]] who renamed her as ''Sultan Osman I''. Then, with completion just as [[World War I]] began, she was seized for use by the [[Royal Navy]], an act which contributed to the decision of the Ottoman Empire to support Germany in the war.

Renamed as ''Agincourt'' by the British, she joined the [[Grand Fleet]] in the [[North Sea]]. The ship spent the bulk of her time during the war on patrols and exercises, although she did participate in the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916. ''Agincourt'' was put into [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] in 1919 and sold for [[scrap]] in 1922 to meet the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]].

==Design==
[[File:HMS Agincourt Skizze.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Right elevation and plan view of ''Agincourt'']]
''Agincourt'' was ordered in 1911 as part of the [[South American dreadnought race]] between Brazil, Argentina and Chile in the first decade of the Twentieth Century under the name of ''Rio de Janeiro''. The Brazilians wished to purchase a ship that would outclass those ships building for their rivals. The chief designer of [[Armstrong Whitworth|Armstrong]], [[Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt]], had travelled to Brazil to settle on a design and sign the contract. He brought with him a variety of options for the government to consider and they chose the one with the {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns, partially to maintain commonality with their other battleships already in service.<ref>Topliss, pp. 263<U+2013>64, 269, 280<U+2013>81</ref>

===General characteristics===
''Agincourt'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|671|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|89|ft|m|}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|29|ft|10|in|m|1}} at [[deep load]]. She displaced {{convert|27850|LT|t|0}} at load and {{convert|30860|LT|t|0}} at deep load. She had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|4.9|ft|1}} at deep load.<ref name=b4>Burt, p. 244</ref> She had a large turning circle, but manoeuvered well despite her great length. ''Agincourt'' was considered to be a good gun platform.<ref name=p4>Parkes, p. 604</ref>

She was one of the most comfortable ships in the Royal Navy and very well-appointed internally. A knowledge of Portuguese was necessary to work many of the fittings<U+2014>including those in the [[head (watercraft)|heads]]<U+2014>as the original instruction plates had not all been replaced when she was taken over by the British.<ref name=p4/>

===Propulsion===
''Agincourt'' had four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] direct-drive [[steam turbine]]s, each of which drove one propeller shaft. The high-pressure ahead and astern turbines drove the wing shafts while the low-pressure ahead and astern turbines drove the inner shafts. The three-bladed propellers were {{convert|9|ft|6|in|m|1}} in diameter. The turbines were designed to produce a total of {{convert|34000|shp|lk=in}}, but achieved more than {{convert|40000|shp|abbr=on}} during her [[sea trial]]s, slightly exceeding her designed speed of {{convert|22|knots}}.<ref>Burt, pp. 245, 250</ref>

The steam plant consisted of twenty-two [[Babcock and Wilcox]] [[water-tube boiler]]s with an operating pressure of {{convert|235|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}. ''Agincourt'' normally carried {{convert|1500|LT|t}} of coal, but could carry a maximum of {{convert|3200|LT|t}}, as well as {{convert|620|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, she could steam for {{convert|7000|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. Electrical power was provided by four steam-driven reciprocating [[electrical generator]]s.<ref name=b45>Burt, p. 245</ref>

===Armament===
''Agincourt'' mounted fourteen [[EOC 12 inch/45 naval gun|BL 12-inch Mk XIII]] 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] guns in seven twin hydraulically powered turrets,<ref>Gardiner and Gray, p. 37</ref> unofficially called after the days of the week, starting from Sunday, forward to aft.<ref>Hough, p. 150</ref> This was the greatest number of turrets and heavy guns ever mounted on a battleship.<ref>Gibbons, p. 201</ref> The guns could be depressed to <U+2212>3<U+00B0> and elevated to 13.5<U+00B0>. They fired {{convert|850|lb|kg|adj=on|0}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2725|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}; at 13.5<U+00B0>, this provided a maximum range of just over 20,000 yards with 4[[List of British ordnance terms#C.R.H.|crh]] [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armour-piercing (AP)]] shells. During the war the turrets were modified to increase their maximum elevation to 16<U+00B0>, but this only extended the range to {{convert|20435|yd|m}}. The rate of fire of these guns was 1.5 rounds per minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_12-45_mk13.htm|title=British 12"/45 (30.5 cm) Mark XIII|publisher=navweaps.com |date=20 February 2009 |accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> When a full broadside was fired, observers said that: "The resulting sheet of flame was big enough to create the impression that a battle cruiser had blown up; it was awe inspiring."<ref>Parkes, p. 603</ref> No damage was done to the ship when firing full broadsides, despite the common idea that doing so would break her back, but much of the ship's crockery and glassware would shatter.<ref>Hough, p. 160</ref>

As built ''Agincourt'' mounted eighteen [[BL 6 inch Mk XIII naval gun|BL 6-inch Mk XIII]] 50-calibre guns. Fourteen were placed in armoured [[casemate]]s on the upper deck and two each in the fore and aft superstructures, protected by [[gun shield]]s. Two more were added abreast the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in pivot mounts protected by gun shields when the ship was purchased by the British.<ref name=b50>Burt, p. 250</ref> The guns could be depressed to <U+2212>7<U+00B0> and elevated to 13<U+00B0>, but this was later increased to 15<U+00B0>. They had a range of {{convert|13475|yd}} at 15<U+00B0> when firing a {{convert|100|lb|kg|adj=on|0}} shell with a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2770|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Their rate of fire was about five to seven rounds per minute, but this dropped to about three rounds per minute after the ready ammunition was used up because the ammunition hoists were too slow or few to keep the guns fully supplied. About 150 rounds were carried per gun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_6-50_mk13.htm|title=British 6"/50 (15.2 cm) BL Mark XIII|date=22 January 2009 |publisher=navweaps.com|accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>

Close-range defense against [[torpedo boat]]s was provided by ten {{convert|3|in|adj=on}} 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[List of British ordnance terms#QF|quick-firing]] guns. These were mounted in the superstructure in pivot mounts and protected by gun shields. ''Agincourt'' also carried three {{convert|21|in|adj=on|0}} submerged [[torpedo tube]]s; one was on each beam and the last was in the stern. The water that entered the torpedo tubes when they were fired was discharged into the torpedo flat to facilitate reloading the tube and then pumped overboard. This meant that the crew would be operating in {{convert|3|ft|1}} of water if rapid fire was required. Ten torpedoes were carried for them.<ref>Parkes, pp. 600, 603</ref>

===Fire control===
Each turret was fitted with an armoured [[rangefinder]] in the turret roof. In addition another one was mounted on top of the foretop. By the time of the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916, ''Agincourt'' was possibly the only dreadnought of the [[Grand Fleet]] not fitted with a [[Frederic_Dreyer#Dreyer_Fire_Control_Table|Dreyer fire-control table]].<ref>Friedman, p. 46</ref> A [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire-control director]] was later fitted below the foretop and one turret was modified to control the entire main armament later in the war.<ref name=b45/> A director for the {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns was added on each side in 1916<U+2013>17.<ref name=b50/>

===Armour===
So much weight had been devoted to ''Agincourt''{{'}}s armament that little remained for her armour. Her waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] was just {{convert|9|in|0}} thick, compared with twelve inches or more found in other British dreadnoughts. It ran some {{convert|365|ft|1}}, from the forward edge of 'Monday' barbette to the middle of 'Friday' barbette. Forward of this the belt thinned to six inches for about {{convert|50|ft|1}} before further reducing to {{convert|4|in|0}} all the way to the bow. Aft of the midships section the belt reduced to six inches for about {{convert|30|ft|1}} and then thinned to four inches (102 mm); it did not reach the stern, but terminated at the rear [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]. The upper belt extended from the main to the upper deck and was six inches thick. It ran from 'Monday' barbette to 'Thursday' barbette. The armour bulkheads at each end of the ship angled inwards from the ends of the midships armoured belts to the end barbettes and were three inches thick. Four of ''Agincourt''{{'}}s decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from {{convert|1|to|2.5|in|mm}}.<ref>Burt, pp. 244<U+2013>45</ref>

The armour of the barbettes constituted a major weakness in ''Agincourt''{{'}}s protection. They were nine inches thick above the upper deck level, but decreased to three inches between the upper and main decks and had no armour at all below the main deck except for 'Sunday' barbette (which had three inches), and 'Thursday' and 'Saturday' barbettes (which had two inches). The turret armour was twelve inches thick on the face, {{convert|8|in|0}} on the side and {{convert|10|in|0}} in the rear. The turret roofs were three inches thick at the front and two inches at the rear. The casemates for the secondary armament were protected by six inches of armour and were defended from [[raking fire]] by six-inch thick bulkheads.<ref name=b45/>

The main [[conning tower]] was protected by twelve inches of armor on its sides and it had a four-inch roof. The aft conning tower (sometimes called the torpedo control tower) had nine-inch sides and a three-inch roof. The communications tube down from each position was six-inches thick above the upper deck and two-inches thick below it. Each magazine was protected by two armour plates on each side as [[torpedo bulkhead]]s, the first one inch thick and the second one and a half inches thick.<ref name=b50/>

''Agincourt'' had another weakness in that she was not subdivided to Royal Navy standards as the Brazilians preferred to eliminate all possible watertight bulkheads that might limit the size of the compartments and interfere with the crew's comfort. One example was the officer's [[wardroom]], which was {{convert|85|by|60|ft|1}} in size; much larger than anything in the [[Grand Fleet]].<ref>Hough, pp. 89<U+2013>90</ref>

===Wartime modifications===
Approximately {{convert|70|LT|t}} of high-tensile steel to the main deck was added after the Battle of Jutland to protect the [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s. Two {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] guns were added to the quarterdeck in 1917<U+2013>18. A {{convert|9|ft|m|1|adj=on}} rangefinder was added to the former [[searchlight]] platform on the [[foremast]] at the same time. A high-angle rangefinder was added to the [[Top (sailing ship)|spotting top]] in 1918.<ref name=b50/>

==Construction==
''Rio de Janeiro'', as ''Agincourt'' was named by her first owners, was [[laid down]] on 14 September 1911 by [[Armstrong Whitworth|Armstrongs]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 22 January 1913.<ref name=b45/> However, the rubber trade on which Brazil was reliant collapsed shortly afterward and she was put up for sale in October 1913.<ref>Hough, p. 72</ref> Brazil sold the vessel to the [[Ottoman Navy]] for <U+00A3>2,750,000 on 28 December 1913.<ref>Hough, p. 75</ref> Renamed the ''Sultan Osman I'', she underwent trials in July 1914 and was completed in August, just as [[World War I]] began.<ref>Hough, pp. 109<U+2013>22</ref>

===Seizure===
The war broke out during her sea trials before delivery. Even though the Ottoman crew had arrived to collect her, the British Government took over the vessel for incorporation into the Royal Navy. At the same time the British also took over a second Ottoman battleship, a [[King George V class battleship (1911)|''King George V'' class]]-derived vessel being built by [[Vickers]]<U+2014>the ''Reshadiye''<U+2014>which was renamed {{HMS|Erin|1913|6}}. Such an action was allowed for in the contracts, as then-First Lord of the Admiralty [[Winston Churchill#First Lord of the Admiralty|Winston Churchill]] did not want to risk the ships being used against the British, but it had consequences.<ref>Hough, p. 121</ref>

The takeover caused considerable ill will in the [[Ottoman Empire]], where public subscriptions had partially funded the ships. When the Ottoman government had been in a financial deadlock over the budget of the battleships, people's donations were solicited. In taverns, caf<U+00E9>s, schools and markets many donated some amount of money for the Ottoman Navy. To encourage this campaign, plentiful donations were awarded with a medal called the "Navy Donation Medal". This proved an important factor in turning Ottoman public opinion against [[United Kingdom|Britain]], especially as the Ottoman Navy had been pro-Britain <U+2014> the Army having been pro-German. It helped bring the Ottoman Empire into the war on the side of [[Germany]] and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] against the [[Triple Entente]] of Britain, [[France]], and [[Russia]] on 29 October 1914.<ref>Hough, pp. 143<U+2013>44</ref>

===Modifications for the Royal Navy===
The Royal Navy made modifications before commissioning her: in particular they removed the flying deck over the two centre turrets. The ship was also initially fitted with [[squat toilet|Turkish-style lavatories]] that had to be replaced.<ref>Hough, pp. 152<U+2013>53</ref> Her name, "Agincourt", was a favourite of Churchill's, and had initially been allocated to a sixth vessel of the [[Queen Elizabeth class battleship|''Queen Elizabeth''-class]] ordered under the 1914-15 Naval Estimates, but not yet begun at the war's outbreak.<ref>Parkes, p. 600</ref> Her nickname, ''The Gin Palace'', came from her luxurious fittings and a corruption of her name ('''A Gin Court'''), [[Pink Gin]] having been a popular drink among Royal Navy officers at the time.<ref>Hough, p. 147</ref>

The Admiralty was unprepared to man a ship of ''Agincourt''{{'}}s size on such short notice and her crew was drawn "from the highest and lowest echelons of the service: the Royal yachts, and the detention barracks." ''Agincourt''{{'}}s captain and executive officer came from {{ship|HMY|Victoria and Albert III}}, most of whose crew was also transferred to ''Agincourt'' on 3 August 1914. Most of the naval reservists had already been called up by this time and sent to other ships so a number of minor criminals who had had their sentences remitted were received from various naval prisons and detention camps.<ref>Hough, pp. 148<U+2013>52</ref>

==Service==
''Agincourt'' was [[Shakedown (testing)|shaking down]] until 7 September 1914 when she joined the [[4th Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|4th Battle Squadron]] (BS) of the Grand Fleet.<ref name=p5>Parkes, p. 605</ref> The fleet anchorage at [[Scapa Flow]] was not yet secure against submarine attack and much of the fleet was kept at sea where ''Agincourt'' spent forty of her first eighty days with the Grand Fleet. This was the beginning of "a year and a half of inaction, only broken by occasional North Sea "sweeps" intended to draw the enemy from his bases."<ref>Hough, p. 161</ref>

On 1 January 1915 she was still assigned to the 4th BS, but had been assigned to the [[1st Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|1st Battle Squadron]] before the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May 1916. ''Agincourt'' was the last ship of the Sixth Division of the 1st BS, along with {{HMS|Hercules|1910|6}}, {{HMS|Revenge|06|6}} and the flagship, {{HMS|Marlborough|1912|6}}, the most heterogeneous group possible as each ship was from a different class. The Sixth Division was the starboardmost column of the Grand Fleet as it headed south to rendezvous with [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Admiral Beatty]]'s [[Battlecruiser Fleet]], then engaged with their opposite numbers from the German [[High Seas Fleet]] in the [[North Sea]].<ref>Hough, p. 174</ref> Admiral [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Jellicoe]], commander of the Grand Fleet, kept it in cruising formation until 6:15 p.m.<ref group=Note>The times used in this article are in [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], which is one hour behind [[Central European Time|CET]], which is often used in German works.</ref> when he ordered it to deploy from column into a single line based on the port division, each ship turning 90<U+00B0> in succession. This turn made the Sixth Division the closest ships in the Grand Fleet to the battleships of the High Seas Fleet and they fired on each ship as they made their turn to port. This concentration of fire later became known as "Windy Corner" to the British as the ships were drenched by German shell splashes although none were hit.<ref>Hough, p. 179</ref>

At 6:24 ''Agincourt'' opened fire on a German battlecruiser with her main guns. Shortly afterwards her six-inch guns followed suit as German destroyers made torpedo attacks on the British battleships to cover the turn to the south of the High Seas Fleet.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 131, 133</ref> ''Agincourt'' successfully evaded two torpedoes.<ref>Massie, p. 630</ref> Visibility cleared around 7:15 and ''Agincourt'' engaged a {{sclass|Kaiser|battleship}} without result before it was lost in the smoke and haze.<ref>Hough, p. 183</ref> Around 8:00 ''Marlborough'' was forced to reduce speed because of the strain on her bulkheads from her torpedo damage and her division mates conformed to her speed.<ref>Burt, p. 206</ref> In the reduced visibility the division lost sight of the Grand Fleet during the night, passing the badly damaged battlecruiser {{SMS|Seydlitz}} without opening fire.<ref>Massie, p. 651</ref> Dawn found them with only the detritus from the previous day's battle in sight and the division arrived back at Scapa Flow on 2 June.<ref>Hough, pp. 184<U+2013>85</ref> ''Agincourt'' fired 144 twelve-inch shells and 111 six-inch shells during the battle although she is not known to have hit anything.<ref name=p5/>

[[File:HMS Agincourt und Erin.jpg|right|thumb|Both of the seized Ottoman ships in 1918: ''Agincourt'' (foreground) with ''Erin'']]
Although the Grand Fleet made several sorties over the next few years it is not known if ''Agincourt'' participated in them. On 23 March 1918, ''Agincourt'' and ''Hercules'' were stationed at Scapa Flow to provide cover for the Scandinavian convoys between Norway and Britain when the High Seas Fleet sortied in an attempt to destroy the convoy. The reports from German Intelligence were slightly off schedule, however, as both the inbound and outbound convoys were in port when the Germans reached their normal route so Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer|Scheer]] ordered the fleet to return to Germany without spotting any British ships.<ref>Newbolt, pp. 236<U+2013>37</ref> 

''Agincourt'' was later transferred to the [[2nd Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|2nd Battle Squadron]]<ref name=p5/> and she was present at the surrender of the High Seas Fleet on 21 November 1918.<ref>Hough, p. 186</ref> She was placed in reserve at Rosyth in March 1919. After unsuccessful attempts to sell her to the Brazilian Government, she was briefly recommissioned for experimental purposes in 1921. She was sold for scrap on 19 Dec 1922 to comply with the tonnage limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty, although she was not actually broken up until the end of 1924.<ref name=b50/>
