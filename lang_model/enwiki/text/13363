'''Fredrik Thorbj<U+00F8>rn Kayser''', [[Military Medal|MM]] (25 May 1918 <U+2013> 2 February 2009) was a [[Norwegian resistance movement|Norwegian resistance]] member during [[World War II]]. He was especially noted for his role in the [[Norwegian heavy water sabotage]], and has been referred to as "Western Norway's [[Gunnar S<U+00F8>nsteby]]".

==Early life==
Kayser grew up at [[Paradis, Bergen|Paradis]] in Bergen. Among his youth experiences was a period as a [[boy scout]], under later resistance member [[Fredrik Rieber-Mohn]]. When drafted for [[compulsory military service]] after finishing school, he enrolled in the [[Hans Majestet Kongens Garde|His Majesty The King's Guard]], finishing his eight months<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mil.no/multimedia/archive/00036/Gardens_Historie_ett_36943a.doc |title=Gardens Historie etter krigen |accessdate=2009-02-07 |last=Jenssen |first=Stian |date= |work=[[Norwegian Armed Forces]] |publisher= |language=Norwegian }}</ref> of service in 1938.<ref name=bt>{{cite news|title=Sabot<U+00F8>ren|last=Ask|first=<U+00D8>yvind|date=25 May 2008|work=[[Bergens Tidende]]|language=Norwegian}}</ref> In 1939, reportedly after attending a performance of the [[symphonic poem]] ''[[Finlandia]]'', he volunteered to fight on [[Finland]]'s side in the [[Winter War]]. In 1998 he stated that he "wanted to defeat the Communist system". He also stated that he never actually fired a gunshot.<ref name=aft>{{cite news|title=Krigssabot<U+00F8>ren - Fredrik Kayser har g<U+00E5>tt stille i d<U+00F8>rene i 50 <U+00E5>r|last=Guhnfeldt|first=Cato|date=17 June 1998|work=Aftenposten|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

==World War II==
Norway was [[Operation Weser<U+00FC>bung|invaded by Germany]] on 9 April 1940. Coincidentally, Kayser returned to Norway from Finland on this date, crying as he found the capital city [[Oslo]] invaded.<ref name=bt93>{{cite news|title=Smellet som gav gjenlyd verden over|last=Pedersen|first=Kjell|date=15 February 1993|work=Bergens Tidende|language=Norwegian}}</ref> He became involved in the [[Norwegian Campaign|fighting]] that ensued elsewhere in Norway. On 25 April he fought in the Battle of Skjervet in [[Granvin]]. The Norwegian forces lost, and retreated to [[Gudvangen]].<ref name=aft/>

From there Kayser travelled to Bergen, where he involved himself in the illegal press. After some time he decided to take part in secret military and sabotage operations. He escaped to England in September 1941, and enrolled in the [[Norwegian Independent Company 1]] led by [[Martin Linge]]. Kayser was recruited from the regular training to the so-called Finishing School, where the emphasis was on secret agent skills.<ref name=aft/> His first mission was the [[Operation Anklet]] in December 1941.<ref name=bt/> In 1942 he planned Operation Woodcock together with [[Kasper Idland]] and Kjell Endresen, two other Norwegian Independent Company 1 soldiers. They were to parachute onto the Nevlandsheia plateau in [[Gjesdal]] and from there carry out a sabotage operation against the strategically important [[Sola Air Station]] in [[Western Norway]]. The team's first attempt to carry out the operation failed due to fog obscuring the drop zone. Further attempts were called off after a French sabotage team was intercepted by the Germans and explosives designed for the operation fell into German hands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sandnesavisen.no/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=869&Itemid=149 |title=Kasper Idland  |accessdate=2009-02-06 |last=Amdal |first=Nils Helge |work=Sandnesavisen.no |publisher= |date=12 March 2008 |language=Norwegian }}</ref>

===Heavy water sabotage===
[[File:Vemork Hydroelectric Plant 1935.jpg|thumb|The Vemork hydroelectric plant in 1935. The heavy water was produced in the front building (the Hydrogen Production Plant).]]
{{Main|Norwegian heavy water sabotage}}
In 1942 the British [[Operation Freshman]], directed against the heavy water production facility at [[Vemork]], failed miserably.<ref name=bt93/> In 1943 another attempt was made, codenamed [[Operation Gunnerside]]. Following an aborted attempt in January,<ref name=bt93/> Kayser was a part of the team that successfully parachuted onto the [[Hardangervidda]] plateau on 16 February 1943.<ref>Moland 1987: 8</ref> Kayser was one of the first two saboteurs to enter the Vemork facility on 27 February, crawling through a cable shaft, the other being the team leader, [[Joachim R<U+00F8>nneberg]]. They surprised the person who guarded the [[heavy water]] cylinders in the factory&mdash;in retrospect the guard was described as "a good Norwegian".<ref name=bt93/> Kayser, at the time a sergeant,<ref name="KayserNova">{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hydro/resi-vemork.html#kays |title=Fredrik Kayser |accessdate=4 February 2009 |last=Mears |first=Ray |coauthors= |date= |work=[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]}}</ref> and R<U+00F8>nneberg went on to place explosive charges on the heavy water cylinders in the factory. Two more members of the Gunnerside team later joined Kayser and R<U+00F8>nneberg by climbing through a window. During the operation a Norwegian watchman was temporarily detained, and guarded by Kayser,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hydro/resistance.html |title=Norwegian Resistance Coup |accessdate=4 February 2009 |last=Mears |first=Ray |authorlink=Ray Mears |coauthors= |date=October 2005 |work=Nova |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service}}</ref> being released 30 seconds before the explosives went off. The saboteurs of Operation Gunnerside escaped unharmed, even though the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|German occupying authorities]] deployed thousands of soldiers to search Hardangervidda for the saboteurs.<ref name="Voks<U+00F8>311">Voks<U+00F8> 1994: 311</ref> Kayser made his way to Sweden<ref name="KayserNova"/> with four other team members by way of a two-week, {{convert|400|km|-1|sp=uk|adj=on}} ski trek.<ref name="Voks<U+00F8>311"/> In all the operation resulted in the destruction of 18 heavy water cells and 500&nbsp;kg of heavy water, with a loss of production of 400&nbsp;kg.<ref>Moland 1987: 9</ref>

For his role in the heavy water sabotage Kayser was awarded the [[Military Medal]] by King [[George VI of the United Kingdom]].<ref name="KayserNova"/>

===Submarines===
After the heavy water sabotage, Kayser returned to England. This time, he was educated in steering one-man [[midget submarine]]s. In 1944 Kayser and three other men were tasked with assaulting German ships in the harbour of [[M<U+00E5>l<U+00F8>y]]. However, the plan went sour as locals became alarmed of their presence. Kayser had to escape by land.<ref name=aft/> He reportedly entrenched himself in a marsh for a whole day in order to escape a [[Gestapo]] search party.<ref name=bt93/>

===Bj<U+00F8>rn West===
In the last year of the war the Norwegian resistance movement established base areas in remote locations in Norway to provide hiding places for people on the run from the German occupiers. Five base areas were planned, although only two were completed (''Bj<U+00F8>rn'' and ''Elg'') by the time of the German capitulation on [[Victory in Europe Day|V-E Day]], with a third (''Varg'') still under construction. In addition to serve as safe heavens the bases were also to train the refugees in guerilla tactics, using instructors from Norwegian Independent Company 1.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kraglund |first=Ivar |editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl, Hans Fredrik]] |encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]] |title=baser |url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/b/b1.html#baser |accessdate= |edition= |date= |year=1995 |month= |publisher=Cappelen |volume= |location=Oslo |isbn= |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Kayser, then a lieutenant, was second-in-command of the base ''[[Bj<U+00F8>rn West]]'' at [[Matre]] in [[Masfjorden]] and took part in the 28 April&ndash;3 May 1945 fighting after the base was discovered by the Germans.<ref name="Bj<U+00F8>rnW">{{cite web |url=http://www.scandion.no/bjornwest/film/1.html |title=Bj<U+00F8>rn West &mdash; bak fiendens linjer  |accessdate=2009-02-05 |last=Lunde |first=Kjell Harald |work=Bj<U+00F8>rn West Mus<U+00E9>et |publisher= |date=May 1994 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Kayser had arrived in Masfjorden in October 1944 with a fellow Norwegian Independent Company 1 soldier, [[second lieutenant]] Severin Synnes. The two had been transported to Masfjorden from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] on the Royal Norwegian Navy [[submarine chaser]] [[HNoMS Vigra|HNoMS ''Vigra'']] with orders to establish ''Bj<U+00F8>rn West''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scandion.no/hordaland/masfjorden/lokalhistorie/artiklar/bwstyrkane.html |title=Bj<U+00F8>rn West styrkane i Masfjordfjella og forsyningane fr<U+00E5> Gulen og Brekke |accessdate=6 February 2009 |last=Austgulen |first=Ingolf |work=Scandion |publisher= |date=30 September 2001 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

===Awards and honours===
In total, Kayser received fourteen decorations for his wartime efforts. In addition to the Military Medal, he received the [[L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur]] and twice the [[St. Olav's Medal With Oak Branch]]. Thus he was referred to as "Western Norway's [[Gunnar S<U+00F8>nsteby]]".<ref name=aft/> On 8 May 2012, on the 67th anniversary of the [[Victory in Europe Day|end of the Second World War in Europe]], a memorial to Fredrik Kayser will be unveiled at Storetveit in Bergen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forsvaret.no/veteraner/aktiviteter/veterandagen/Sider/Bergen.aspx |title=Program for Bergen |author= |date= |work=[[Norwegian Armed Forces]] |publisher= |accessdate=24 April 2012 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

==Post-war life==
Kayser left the military after the war, and spent the rest of his professional career working in the private business sector. He was a member of [[Fana]] [[municipal council (Norway)|municipal council]] for eight years during the 1950s, representing the [[Conservative Party of Norway|Conservative Party]], although he was not formally a member of the party.<ref name=ntb>{{cite news|title=Fredrik Kayser 80 <U+00E5>r 25. mai|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=20 May 1998|language=Norwegian}}</ref> He also became a devout Christian after the war.<ref name=bt93/>

Kayser played himself in the [[docudrama]] ''[[The Fight Over the Heavy Water|Kampen om tungtvannet]]'', released in 1948. Despite appearing publicly in the film, for several decades Kayser was unwilling to conduct in-depth interviews about his wartime actions.<ref name=bt-obit>{{cite news|url=http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article785254.ece|title=Krigshelten d<U+00F8>de mandag|last=Lura|first=Christian|date=2 February 2009|work=Bergens Tidende|language=Norwegian|accessdate=4 February 2009}}</ref> He cited recurring nightmares as the reason for his unwillingness to recapitulate the war period.<ref name=aft/> Ultimately, the writer Kjell Harald Lunde got Kayser's consent, and in 1997 Lunde published the book ''Sabot<U+00F8>ren'' ('The Saboteur').<ref name=bt-obit/> Kayser had participated in a [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] production on ''Bj<U+00F8>rn West'' in the spring of 1994. Kayser's son, Johan Fr. Kayser, played his father in the television production.<ref name="Bj<U+00F8>rnW"/>

Fredrik Kayser died on 2 February 2009, having suffered from failing health for four months.<ref name=bt-obit/> He had lived in [[<U+00C5>gotnes]] since 1974.<ref name=ntb/>
