The name ''Jigglypuff'' is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''[[wikt:jiggly|jiggly]]'', referring to its motion, and ''[[wikt:puff|puff]]'', referring to its buoyancy. Its [[Japanese language|Japanese]] name, ''Purin'', probably derives from {{nihongo|''purin''|<U+30D7><U+30EA><U+30F3>}}, the Japanese word for [[Cr<U+00E8>me caramel|custard pudding]]. It may also come from a combination of many [[japanese language|Japanese]] words; {{nihongo|''fukureru''|<U+81A8><U+308C><U+308B>}}, meaning to swell or expand; {{nihongo|''fukafukashita''|<U+3075><U+304B><U+3075><U+304B><U+3057><U+305F>}}, meaning soft or fluffy; {{nihongo|''f<U+016B>sen''|<U+98A8><U+8239>}}, meaning [[balloon]]; and {{nihongo|''mari''|<U+97A0>}}, meaning ball. Essentially, it could be taken to mean "a soft and fluffy ball," "a swelling balloon," or a combination of the two.

==Design==
Jigglypuff is a fictional character from the Nintendo franchise [[Pokemon]]. Jigglypuff is a balloon of a Pok<U+00E9>mon. Its body is globular, pink, fluffy, cuddly, and accented with stubby appendages, a tiny tuft of a single curl of hair, and enormous blue eyes, featuring green eyes for its alternate color version. A a "balloon type", its skin is rubbery and stretchy. As a result, Jigglypuff has the ability to puff its body full of air to make it look larger than it actually is, or flatten its body, much like fellow Nintendo character Kirby. An exact limit to the size it can grow to in this manner is unknown. Jigglypuff [[Pok<U+00E9>mon evolution|evolves]] from [[List of Pok<U+00E9>mon (161-180)#Igglybuff|Igglybuff]] through happiness, and to [[List of Pok<U+00E9>mon (21-40)#Wigglytuff|Wigglytuff]] with the use of a [[List of Pok<U+00E9>mon items#Evolution Stones|Moon Stone]].

Jigglypuff's signature attack is to sing its opponent to sleep. The song's sound waves matches that of the brain waves of something that is asleep, and anything within earshot will be affected unless protected by an innate ability (such as Insomnia or Soundproof) or interference from additionanl sounds. Jigglypuff can easily adjust the wavelength of its voice, without pausing to take a breath. If the target shows no sign of sleepiness, there is a possibility it will not stop singing, and as a result die from oxygen deprevation.

==In video games==
Jigglypuff can be found in all of the Pok<U+00E9>mon video games, as well as ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Snap]]'', which makes an allusion to the anime's counterpart. At one point of the game, a Jigglypuff bothered by Koffin can be rescued. If done, it and two others will appear to sing towards the end of the stage, with the central one holding the anime version's marker-based "microphone", and will swell up in anger if the player uses the pok<U+00E9>flute item at this time.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

Jigglypuff is an unlockable character in all three games of the [[Super Smash Bros. (series)|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]].<ref>[http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/hidden10.html Smash Bros. DOJO!! Jigglypuff Profile]. Nintendo. Retrived on [[2008]]-[[May 06|05-06]]</ref> It can jump multiple times in midair (in the first two games, the only other character that could do this was [[Kirby (Nintendo)|Kirby]]. In ''Brawl'', other characters were given this ability, including fellow Pok<U+00E9>mon [[Charizard]], [[Meta Knight]], and [[Pit (Kid Icarus)|Pit]]). The Rest attack, in which Jigglypuff descends near an opponent and immediately goes to rest, is difficult to connect, but when successful, often rockets even healthy opponents off the stage; this makes it one of the most powerful attacks in the game.<ref>{{cite video game

In [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Brawl]], Jigglypuff's Final Smash is called Puff Up. Where Jigglypuff puffs up bigger and bigger, than it delivers one massive hit. It will work perfectly on small stages, but will be challenging on larger stages. In the Super Smash Bros. games, Jigglypuff is often underrated by players considering it as the [[Dan Hibiki]] of the series (also due to similar colours) due to its slow speed and light weight, but these are outweighed by its multi-jumping, maneuverability, and combo attacking abilities.

==In the anime==
In the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon (anime)|Pok<U+00E9>mon]] [[anime]] series, Jigglypuff is a recurring character who aspires to be a great singer after the inspiration of [[Ash Ketchum]] and company. Unfortunately, every potential audience falls asleep before the song finishes. Jigglypuff does not usually choose an appropriate time to sing and has been a hazard many times, especially on moving vehicles. Because of this, [[Ash Ketchum]] and his companions often find themselves running away from Jigglypuff, who obviously isn't pleased with the fact that everyone falls asleep whenever it sings. It keeps with it a black [[Marker pen|marker]], its "[[microphone]]," (which had once belonged to Ash) and uses it to scribble on anyone who dares to fall asleep while it's performing (after it inflates itself in anger with a distinctive "honk" sound). Only on two occasions has Jigglypuff believed that anyone had heard its song to the end: in the first, Jigglypuff realizes that Misty's [[List of Pok<U+00E9>mon (41-60)#Psyduck|Psyduck]] was sleeping with its eyes open, and in the second, a [[List of Pok<U+00E9>mon (281-300)#Whismur|Whismur]] (a Pok<U+00E9>mon with "soundproof" ability and therefore immune to sound-based Pok<U+00E9>mon moves) had heard the song the first time, but on the second time it was tired so it fell asleep anyway. There was once when Jigglypuff sang to two gigantic pokemons battling each other, these two Pokemon did not fall asleep, and instead Jigglypuff was knocked away by the energy of their battle. Another Jigglypuff (In the episode ''Rough, Tough, Jigglypuff'') had a [[List of Pok<U+00E9>mon (281-300)#Loudred|Loudred]] (Whismur's evolved form and therefore also bearing the "soundproof" ability) listen to its song, but it didn't care as this Jigglypuff was using Sing for an attack.

In Pok<U+00E9>mon Chronicles, Marina has a Jigglypuff, but when using Sing, people aren't affected in part because of [[List of Pok<U+00E9>mon (1-20)#Beedrill|Beedrill]], because the beating of its wings are too loud.

This recurring gag with Jigglypuff was also used in ''[[Hey You, Pikachu!]]'' on the [[Nintendo 64]]. A similar Jigglypuff also appeared in the US stage musical ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Live!]]'' Prior to the storyline depicted in the musical, a Pok<U+00E9>mon Trainer who happened to be [[deafness|deaf]] had caught Jigglypuff. When Ash and friends confront this trainer, he sends out Jigglypuff, who succeeds in putting the heroes to sleep. Since the trainer is deaf, he obviously cannot hear the song and is therefore immune to her effects.

In 2006, Viz released a series of ten DVDs based around individual Pok<U+00E9>mon in celebration of Pok<U+00E9>mon's 10th anniversary in the United States. The Pok<U+00E9>mon featured were determined by an online poll on Pok<U+00E9>mon.com.<ref>[http://pokemon.com/#news_/XML/news_55.xml Make your Pok<U+00E9>mon a Star!] Pok<U+00E9>mon.com.

==In other media and pop culture==
Jigglypuff has had sizable roles in most of the various Pok<U+00E9>mon manga series.  Jigglypuff also features prominently in many of the Pok<U+00E9>mon chapter books, which generally follow the anime series closely. The [[Magical Pok<U+00E9>mon Journey]] [[manga]] series has a Jigglypuff as one of the main characters, parodying Hello Kitty, and is introduced to the series in a volume called ''Cooking With Jigglypuff'' (ISBN 1-56931-456-X). <ref>{{cite book

''Jigglypuff's Magic Lullaby'' (ISBN 1-56931-442-X) is part of the ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Tales'' series for very young children. Written by [[Megumi Hayashibara]] and illustrated by Kagemaru Himeno, it tells the story of a female Jigglypuff who wants to make the other Pok<U+00E9>mon happy by singing for them. Yet, as usual, her song puts them to sleep, and this makes her very sad.  Her friend, a [[Bulbasaur]], helps her resolve the situation.<ref>{{cite book

In January 2006, a man named Donnell Bolton on ''[[American Idol]]'' performed Jigglypuff's signature song in his audition. This shocked quite a few people, for the strangeness of the choice as well as the fact that an older person was familiar with Pok<U+00E9>mon.<ref>[http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3147745 American Idol Contestant Sings Jigglypuff]. 1Up.com.
