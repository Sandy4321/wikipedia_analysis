'''Yamada Nagamasa''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: <U+5C71><U+7530><U+9577><U+653F> ''Yamada Nagamasa''; [[1590]]&mdash;[[1630]]) was a [[Japan]]ese adventurer who gained considerable influence in [[Thailand]] at the beginning of the [[17th century]] and became the ruler of the [[Nakhon Si Thammarat province|Nakhon Si Thammarat]] province in southern Thailand.

Yamada Nagamasa was born in [[Numazu]] in 1590. He is said to have been a palanquin bearer of the lord of [[Numazu]]. He became involved in Japanese trade activities with [[South-East Asia]] during the period of the [[Red seal ships]] and settled in the kingdom of [[Ayutthaya kingdom|Ayutthaya]] (modern-day Thailand) from around [[1612]]. 

==Japanese settlement in southeast Asia==
Yamada Nagamasa lived in the Japanese quarters of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]], home to another 1,500 Japanese inhabitants (some estimates run as high as 7,000). The community was called "Ban Yipun" in Thai, and was headed by a Japanese chief nominated by Thai authorities. It seems to have been a combination of traders, Christian converts who had fled their home country following the persecutions of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] and [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], and unemployed former samurai who had been on the losing side at the battle of [[battle of Sekigahara|Sekigahara]]:

:''"From the years of Gen'na (1615-1624) through the later years of Kan'ei (1624-1644), the ''[[Ronin]]'' or warriors who lost their lords after the defeats of the [[battle of Osaka]] (1614-15) or the earlier [[battle of Sekigahara]] (1600), as well as the defeated Christians of the Shimabara uprising, went to settle in Siam in great numbers"'' (Senrakoku Fudo-gunki, 17th century, quoted by Uchida Ginzo).

The Christian community seems to have been in the hundreds, as described by Padre Antonio Francisco Cardim, who recounted having administered sacrament to around 400 Japanese Christians in 1627 in the Thai capital of [[Ayuthaya]] ("a 400 japoes christaos")(Ishii Yoneo, Multi-cultural Japan).

The colony was active in trade, particularly in the export of deer-hide to Japan in exchange for Japanese silver and Japanese handicrafts (swords, lacquered boxes, high-quality papers). They were noted by the Dutch for challenging the trade monopoly of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC). The colony also had an important military role in Thailand.

==Military involvement and lordship==

The Japanese colony was highly valued for its military expertise, and was organized under a "Department of Japanese Volunteers" (''Krom Asa Yipun'') by the Thai king. 

In the space of fifteen years, Yamada Nagamasa rose from the low Thai nobility rank of ''khun'' to the senior of ''Okya'', his title becoming ''Okya Senaphimuk''. He became the head of the Japanese colony, and in this position supported the military campaigns of the Thai king [[Songtham]], at the head of a Japanese army flying the Japanese flag. He fought successfully, and was finally nominated Lord of Ligor (modern [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]]), in the southern peninsula in [[1630]], accompanied by 300 samurai.

==Travels between Siam and Japan==

After more than twelve years in Siam, Yamada Nagamasa went to Japan in [[1624]] onboard one of his ships, where he sold a cargo of Siamese deer hide in [[Nagasaki]]. He stayed in Japan for three years, trying to obtain a Red Seal permit, but finally left in 1627, with the simple status of a foreign ship.

In [[1626]], Nagamasa offered a painting of one of his fighting ships to a temple of his hometown in Shizuoka. That painting was lost in a fire, but a copy of it remains to this day (shown here). It portrays a ship with Western-style rigging, 18 cannons, and sailors in samurai gear. He returned to Siam in [[1627]].

In [[1628]], one of his ships transporting rice from Ayutthaya to [[Malacca]] was arrested by a Dutch warship blockading the city. The ship was released once the identity of the owner became clear, since the Dutch knew that Yamada was held in great respect by the King of Siam, and they did not wish to enter into a diplomatic conflict. Yamada was also valued by the Dutch as a supplier of deer hide, and they invited him to trade more with [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (Accounts of the castle of Batavia, March 1st 1628). 

In [[1629]], Yamada Nagamasa visited Japan with an embassy from the Thai king Songtham. 

He soon travelled back to Siam, but became involved in a succession war following the death of the King Songtham. He was wounded in combat in 1630, and then apparently poisoned through his wound, which led to his death.

==End of relations between Siam and Japan==
Following Yamada's death in 1630, the new ruler and usurper king of Siam [[Prasat Thong]] (1630-1655) sent an army of 4000 soldiers to destroy the Japanese settlement in Ayutthaya, but many Japanese managed to flee to [[Cambodia]]. A few years later in [[1633]], returnees from Indochina were able to re-establish the Japanese settlement in Ayutthaya (300-400 Japanese).

From 1634, the Shogun, informed of these troubles and what he perceived as attacks on his authority, refused to issue further [[Red Seal ship]] permits for Siam. 

Desirous to renew trade however, the king of Siam sent a trading ship and an embassy to Japan in 1636, but the embassies were rejected by the Shogun thus putting an end to direct relations between Japan and Siam. Japan was concomitantly closing itself to the world at that time, essentially to protect itself from [[Christianity]], initiating the "Closed Country", or [[Sakoku]], period. 

The Dutch took over the lucrative Siam-Japan trade from that time on.

Nagamasa now rests in his hometown in the area of Otani. The remnants of the Japanese quarters in Ayutthuya are still visible to visitors, as well as a statue of Yamada in Siamese military uniform.
