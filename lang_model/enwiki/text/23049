'''George Roger Waters''' (born 6 September 1943) is an English musician, singer-songwriter and composer. He was a founding member of the [[rock music|rock]] group [[Pink Floyd]], serving as bassist and co-lead vocalist. Following the departure of bandmate [[Syd Barrett]] in 1968, Waters became the band's lyricist, principal songwriter and conceptual leader. The band subsequently achieved worldwide success in the 1970s with the [[concept album]]s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'', ''[[Animals (album)|Animals]]'', and ''[[The Wall]]''. Although Waters' primary instrument in Pink Floyd was the electric bass guitar, he also experimented with [[synthesiser]]s and [[Music loop|tape loops]] and played electric and acoustic guitars in recordings and in concert. Amid creative differences within the group, Waters left Pink Floyd in 1985 and began a legal battle with the remaining members over their future use of the group's name and material. The dispute was settled out of court in 1987, and nearly eighteen years passed before he performed with Pink Floyd again. It is estimated that as of 2010, the group have sold over 200&nbsp;million albums worldwide, including 74.5&nbsp;million units sold in the United States.

Waters' solo career has included three studio albums: ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking]]'' (1984), ''[[Radio K.A.O.S.]]'' (1987), and ''[[Amused to Death]]'' (1992). In 1986, he contributed songs and a score to the soundtrack of the movie ''[[When the Wind Blows (film)|When the Wind Blows]]'' based on the [[Raymond Briggs]] book of the same name. In 1990, he staged one of the largest rock concerts in history, ''[[The Wall <U+2013> Live in Berlin]]'', with an estimated 200,000 people in attendance. In 1996, he was inducted into the US and UK [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of Pink Floyd. He has toured extensively as a solo act since 1999 and played ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' in its entirety for his [[The Dark Side of the Moon Live|world tours of 2006<U+2013>2008]]. In 2005, he released ''[[<U+00C7>a Ira]]'', an [[opera]] in three acts translated from [[Etienne Roda-Gil]] and his wife Nadine Delahaye's [[libretto]] based on the early [[French Revolution]]. On 2 July 2005, he reunited with Pink Floyd bandmates [[Nick Mason]], [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]], and [[David Gilmour]] for the [[Live 8]] benefit concert, the group's only appearance with Waters since their last performance with him 24 years earlier. In 2010, he commenced [[The Wall Live (2010<U+2013>2011 tour)|The Wall Live]], a worldwide tour that features a complete performance of ''The Wall''. Waters has been married four times and has three children.

==Early years (1943<U+2013>1964)==

Roger Waters was born on 6 September 1943, the younger of two boys, to Mary and [[Eric Fletcher Waters]], in [[Great Bookham]], Surrey.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fitch|2005|p=335}}</ref> His father, the grandson of a coal miner and prominent [[Labour Party (UK)|
Labour Party]] leader, was a schoolteacher, a devout Christian, and a [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]] member.<ref name="BLAKE13">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=13}}</ref> Fletcher was a [[conscientious objector]] who drove an ambulance during the [[Blitzkrieg]] and the first years of the [[World War II|Second World War]].<ref name="BLAKE13"/> He later changed his stance on strict pacifism and joined an infantry regiment of the British Army, and eventually died in combat with [[The Royal Fusiliers]] Company C at [[Operation Shingle|Anzio]] in Italy in January 1944, when Roger was four months old.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=15<U+2013>16}}</ref> Following Fletcher's death, Mary, also a teacher, moved with her two sons to Cambridge, and raised them there.<ref>{{Harvnb|Manning|2006|pp=5<U+2013>6}}</ref>

Waters attended Morley Memorial Junior School in Cambridge, and later the [[Cambridgeshire High School for Boys]] (now [[Hills Road Sixth Form College]]) with [[Syd Barrett]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Watkinson|Anderson|1991|p=15}}</ref> while his future musical partner, [[David Gilmour]], lived nearby on the city's Mill Road, and attended [[The Perse School]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Watkinson|Anderson|1991|p=18}}</ref> At age&nbsp;15 Waters was chairman of the Cambridge [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|Youth Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (YCND),<ref>{{Harnvb|Mason|2005|pp= 12<U+2013>13}}</ref> having designed its publicity poster and participated in its organisation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2008|p=13}}</ref> Though he was a keen sportsman and a highly regarded member of the high school's cricket and rugby teams,<ref>{{Harvnb|Watkinson|Anderson|1991|p=23}}</ref> his educational experience was lacking, according to Waters, "I hated every second of it, apart from games. The regime at school was a very oppressive one&nbsp;... the same kids who are susceptible to bullying by other kids are also susceptible to bullying by the teachers."<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp= 14<U+2013>19}}</ref> Whereas Waters knew Barrett and Gilmour from his youth in Cambridge, he met future Pink Floyd founding members [[Nick Mason]] and [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]] at the [[University of Westminster|Regent Street Polytechnic]] school of architecture,<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2008|p=320}}</ref> where he enrolled in 1962 after a series of aptitude tests indicated he was well-suited to that field.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=36}}</ref>

By September 1963, Waters and Mason were losing interest in their studies<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=40}}</ref> and they moved into the lower flat of Stanhope Gardens, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the Regent Street Polytechnic.<ref name="MASON20">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=20}}</ref> Waters, Mason and Wright first played music together in the autumn of 1963,<ref name="MASON17">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=17}}</ref> in a group formed by vocalist Keith Noble and bassist [[Clive Metcalfe]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Manning|2006|p=13}}</ref> The group usually called themselves Sigma&nbsp;6, but they also used the name the Meggadeaths.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2008|p=13}}</ref> Waters played rhythm guitar and Mason played drums, Wright played on any keyboard he could arrange to use,<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=17<U+2013>18}}</ref> and Noble's sister Sheilagh provided an occasional vocal accompaniment.<ref name="MASON17"/> In the early years the band performed during private functions and rehearsed in a [[tearoom]] in the basement of Regent Street Polytechnic.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp= 13<U+2013>18}}</ref>

When Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own group in September 1963,<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=18}}</ref> the remaining members asked Barrett and guitar player [[Bob Klose]] to join.<ref name="POVEY14">{{Harvnb|Povey|2008|p=14}}</ref> By January 1964, the group became known as The Abdabs, or The (Screaming) Abdabs.<ref name="POVEY14"/> During the autumn of 1964, the band used the names; Leonard's Lodgers, The Spectrum Five, and eventually, the Tea Set.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=28}}</ref> Sometime during the autumn of 1965, the Tea Set began calling itself Pink Floyd Sound, later The Pink Floyd Sound, and by early 1966,<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2008|p=32}}</ref> Pink Floyd.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp= 30<U+2013>37}}</ref>

By early 1966 Barrett was Pink Floyd's front-man, guitarist, and songwriter.<ref name="MASON87">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=87}}</ref> He wrote or co-wrote all but one track of their debut LP ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]'', released in August 1967.<ref name="MASON87-107">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp= 87<U+2013>107}}</ref> Waters contributed the song "[[Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk]]" (his first sole writing credit) to the album.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p= 91}}</ref> However, by late 1967, Barrett's deteriorating mental health and increasingly erratic behaviour,<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=90<U+2013>114}}</ref> rendered him "unable or unwilling"<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=129}}</ref> to continue in his capacity as Pink Floyd's singer-songwriter and lead guitarist.<ref name="MASON87-107">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp= 87<U+2013>107}}</ref> Working with Barrett eventually proved too difficult, so in early March 1968 Pink Floyd met with managers [[Peter Jenner]] and [[Andrew King (music manager)|Andrew King]] of [[Blackhill Enterprises]] to discuss the band's future. Barrett agreed to leave Pink Floyd, and the band "agreed to Blackhill's entitlement in perpetuity" with regard to "past activities".<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=105}}</ref> The band's new manager [[Steve O'Rourke]] made a formal announcement about the departure of Barrett and the arrival of David Gilmour in April 1968.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=106}}</ref>

In 1969, Waters married his childhood girlfriend Judy Trim; they had no children together and their marriage was dissolved in 1976.<ref>{{Cite news|first= Emmanuel| last= Cooper |title= Judy Trim |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/judy-trim-728769.html |newspaper=The Independent |date= 25 January 2001 |accessdate= 14 October 2010}}</ref> He married his second wife, Lady Carolyne Christie, the niece of the [[Lawrence Dundas, 3rd Marquess of Zetland|Marquess of Zetland]], later that same year. His marriage to Christie produced a son, [[Harry Waters]], a musician who has played keyboards with his father's touring band since 2006,<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2008|pp=335<U+2013>339}}</ref> and a daughter, India Waters.<ref name="Blake 2008 258">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=258}}</ref>

===Waters-led period ===

Filling the void left by Barrett's departure in March 1968, Waters began to chart Pink Floyd's artistic direction. He became the principal songwriter, lyricist, and co-lead vocalist, and would remain the band's dominant creative figure until he left in 1985.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp= 106<U+2013>107, 160<U+2013>161, 265, 278}}</ref> He wrote the lyrics to the five Pink Floyd albums preceding his own departure, starting with ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' (1973) and ending with ''The Final Cut'' (1983), while exerting progressively more creative control over the band and its music.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp= 3, 9, 113, 156, 242, 279, 320, 398}}</ref> With lyrics written entirely by Waters, ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' is one of the most commercially successful rock albums of all time. As of 2004 it has spent 723 weeks on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart and sold over 35&nbsp;million copies worldwide. It was selling over 8,000 units every week as of 2004. According to Pink Floyd biographer Glen Povey, ''Dark Side'' is the world's second best-selling album, and the United States' 21st best-selling album of all time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2008|p= 345}}</ref>

Waters produced thematic ideas that became the impetus for the Pink Floyd [[concept album]]s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973), ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1975), ''[[Animals (album)|Animals]]'' (1977), and ''[[The Wall]]'' (1979)<U+2014>written largely by Waters<U+2014>and ''[[The Final Cut (album)|The Final Cut]]'' (1983)<U+2014>written entirely by Waters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp= 265<U+2013>269}}</ref> He referred or alluded to the cost of war and the loss of his father throughout his work, from "Corporal Clegg" (''[[A Saucerful Of Secrets]]'', 1968) and "Free Four" (''[[Obscured By Clouds]]'', 1972) to "Us and Them" from ''The Dark Side of the Moon'', "[[When the Tigers Broke Free]]", first used in the feature film, ''[[Pink Floyd The Wall (film)|The Wall]]'' (1982), later included with "The Fletcher Memorial Home" on ''The Final Cut'', an album dedicated to his father.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=294}}</ref> The theme and composition of ''The Wall'' was influenced by his upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the [[World War II|Second World War]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp= 294<U+2013>295, 351}}</ref>

''The Wall'' was written almost entirely by Waters and is largely based on Waters' life story,<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p= 260}}</ref> and having sold over 23&nbsp;million [[RIAA certification|RIAA certified units]] in the US as of 2010, is one of the top three best-selling albums of all-time in America, according to RIAA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTop100 |publisher=RIAA |title=RIAA GOLD & PLATINUM Top 100 Albums |accessdate= 17 October 2010}}</ref> Pink Floyd hired [[Bob Ezrin]] to co-produce the album, and cartoonist [[Gerald Scarfe]] to illustrate the album's sleeve art.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=260<U+2013>261}}</ref> The last band performance of ''The Wall'' was on 16 June 1981, at Earls Court London, and this was Pink Floyd's last appearance with Waters until the band's brief reunion at 2 July 2005 Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park, 24 years later.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|Russell|1997|p= 185}}</ref>

In March 1983, the last Waters<U+2013>Gilmour<U+2013>Mason collaboration, ''The Final Cut'', was released. The album was subtitled: "A requiem for the post-war dream by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd".<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2008|p=230}}</ref> Waters is credited with writing all the lyrics as well as all the music on the album. His lyrics to the album were critical of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] government of the day and mention Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] by name. At the time Gilmour did not have any material for the album, so he asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. According to Mason, after power struggles within the band and creative arguments about the album, Gilmour's name "disappeared" from the production credits, though he retained his pay.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp= 264<U+2013>270}}</ref> ''Rolling Stone'' magazine gave the album five stars, with [[Kurt Loder]] calling it "a superlative achievement"<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p= 262}}</ref> and "art rock's crowning masterpiece".<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p= 300}}</ref> Loder viewed the album as "essentially a Roger Waters solo album".<ref>{{Cite web| last = Loder | first = Kurt | title = Pink Floyd: The Final Cut (Toshiba) | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/3045/22114 | publisher = ''Rolling Stone''| date = 14 April 1983 | accessdate = 14 October 2010}}</ref> 

Amidst creative differences within the group, Waters left Pink Floyd in 1985, and began a legal battle with the remaining band members regarding their continued use of the name and material.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2008|pp=240<U+2013>241}}</ref> In December 1985 Waters "issued a statement to EMI and CBS invoking the 'Leaving Member' clause" on his contract. In October 1986, he initiated [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] proceedings to formally dissolve the Pink Floyd partnership. In his submission to the High Court he called Pink Floyd a "spent force creatively".<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2008|pp= 221, 237, 240<U+2013>241, 246}}</ref> Gilmour and Mason opposed the application and announced their intention to continue as Pink Floyd. Waters claims to have been forced to resign much like Wright some years earlier, and he decided to leave Pink Floyd based on legal considerations, stating " ... because, if I hadn't, the financial repercussions would have wiped me out completely."<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp= 312<U+2013>313}}</ref> In December 1987, an agreement between Waters and Pink Floyd was reached.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2008|pp= 240<U+2013>241}}</ref> According to Mason:

<blockquote>
"We eventually formalised a settlement with Roger. On Christmas Eve, 1987,&nbsp;... David and Roger convened for a summit meeting on the houseboat [the ''[[Astoria (recording studio)|Astoria]]''] with Jerome Walton, David's accountant. Jerome painstakingly typed out the bones of a settlement. Essentially<U+2014>although there was far more complex detail<U+2014>the arrangement allowed Roger to be freed from his arrangement with Steve [O'Rourke], and David and me to continue working under the name ''Pink Floyd''. In the end the court accepted Jerome's version as the final and binding document and duly stamped it."<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp= 293<U+2013>294}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Waters was released from his contractual obligation with O'Rourke, and he retained the copyrights to ''The Wall'' concept and his trademarked inflatable pig.<ref>{{Harvnb|Manning|2006|pp= 139}}</ref> The Gilmour-led Pink Floyd released two studio albums: ''[[A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'' (1987), and ''[[The Division Bell]]'' (1994). As of 2006, it is estimated that Pink Floyd have sold over 200&nbsp;million albums worldwide,<ref>{{Harvnb|Manning|2006|p=V}}</ref> including 74.5 million RIAA certified units sold in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTopArt |title=Top Selling Artists |publisher=[[RIAA]]|accessdate= 17 October 2010}}</ref>

Following the release of ''The Final Cut'', Waters embarked on a solo career that produced three concept albums and a movie soundtrack. In 1984, he released his first solo album, ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]'', a project about a man's dreams across one night that dealt with Waters' feelings about his failed marriage to Judy Trim, sex, and the pros and cons of monogamy and family life versus "the call of the wild". <ref name="SCHAFFNER272-273">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp= 272<U+2013>273}}</ref> In the end the character, Reg, chooses love and matrimony over promiscuity.

In 1986, Waters contributed songs and a score to the soundtrack of the movie ''[[When the Wind Blows (film)|When the Wind Blows]]''. His backing band featuring [[Paul Carrack]] was credited as ''The Bleeding Heart Band''.{{fact|date=December 2010}} In 1987, Waters released ''[[Radio K.A.O.S.]]'', a concept album based on a mute man named Billy from an impoverished Welsh mining town who has the ability to physically tune into radio waves in his head. Billy first learns to communicate with a radio DJ, and eventually to control the world's computers. Angry at the state of the world in which he lives, he simulates a nuclear attack. Waters followed the release with a supporting tour also in 1987.<ref>{{Harvnb|Manning|2006|p= 131}}</ref>

In November 1989 the [[Berlin Wall]] fell, and in July 1990 Waters staged one of the largest rock concerts in history, ''[[The Wall <U+2013> Live in Berlin]]'', on the vacant terrain between [[Potsdamer Platz]] and the [[Brandenburg Gate]], with an estimated 200,000 people in attendance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=346}}</ref>   [[Leonard Cheshire]] asked him to do the concert to raise funds for charity. Waters' group of musicians included [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Bryan Adams]], [[Scorpions]], and [[Sin<U+00E9>ad O'Connor]]. Waters also used an East German symphony orchestra and choir, a [[Soviet]] marching band, and a pair of helicopters from the US [[7th Airborne Command and Control Squadron]]. Designed by Mark Fisher, the Wall was 25&nbsp;metres tall and 170&nbsp;metres long and was built across the set. Scarfe's inflatable puppets were recreated on an enlarged scale, and although many rock icons received invitations to the show, Gilmour, Mason, and Wright, did not.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp= 342<U+2013>347}}</ref> Waters released a concert double album of the performance which has been certified platinum by RIAA.<ref name="RIAAGPC"/>

In 1990, Waters hired manager Mark Fenwick and left EMI for a worldwide deal with Columbia.  He divorced his second wife, Carolyne Christie, and released his third studio album, ''[[Amused to Death]]'', in 1992. The record is heavily influenced by the events of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] and the [[Gulf War]], and a critique of the notion of war becoming the subject of entertainment, particularly on television.

===1999<U+2013>2004===

In 1999, after a nearly 12-year hiatus from touring, and a 7-year absence from the music industry, Waters embarked on the In the Flesh Tour, performing both solo and Pink Floyd material. The tour was a financial success in the US and though Waters had booked mostly smaller venues, tickets sold so well that many of the concerts were upgraded to larger ones.<ref name="Povey 2008 329<U+2013>334">{{Harvnb|Povey|2008|pp= 329<U+2013>334}}</ref>  The tour eventually stretched across the world and would span three years.  A concert film was released on CD and DVD, named ''[[In the Flesh Live]]''. During the tour, he played two new songs "Flickering Flame" and "Each Small Candle" as the final encore to many of the shows. His marriage to Phillips ended in 2001, and in 2004, he got engaged to filmmaker Laurie Durning. As of 2010, they are still together.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article7146038.ece |title= Roger Waters: The Pink Floyd bassist is rebuilding The Wall and has refashioned his Pink Floyd concept epic for a new age|first=Mark |last=Paytress |work=[[The Sunday Times]] |date= 12 June 2010|accessdate=19 October 2010}}</ref> In June 2002, he completed the tour with a performance in front of 70,000 people at the [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury Festival of Performing Arts]], playing fifteen Pink Floyd songs and five songs from his solo catalog.<ref name="Povey 2008 329<U+2013>334"/> He was outspoken against the [[Hunting Act 2004|Hunting Act of 2004]], and performed a concert for, and attended marches supporting, the [[Countryside Alliance]]. Waters explained:

<blockquote>
I've become disenchanted with the political and philosophical atmosphere in England. The anti-hunting bill was enough for me to leave England. I did what I could, I did a concert and one or two articles, but it made me feel ashamed to be English. I was in Hyde Park for both the Countryside Alliance marches. There were hundreds of thousands of us there. Good, honest English people. That's one of the most divisive pieces of legislation we've ever had in Great Britain. It's not a case of whether or not I agree with fox hunting, but I will defend to the hilt their right to take part in it."<ref name="Blake 2008 391">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p= 391}}</ref>
</blockquote>

In October 2005, he clarified: "I come back to the UK quite often. I didn't leave as a protest against the hunting ban; I was following a child in the wake of a divorce."<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/roger-waters-french-revolution-509524.html |work=[[The Independent]] |title=Roger Waters: French Revolution|date=4 October 2005|accessdate= 17 October 2010 }}</ref> After leaving Britain, he moved to [[Long Island]] in New York with his fianc<U+00E9> Laurie Durning.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp= 391<U+2013>392}}</ref> [[Miramax]] announced in mid-2004 that a production of ''The Wall'' was to appear on Broadway with Waters playing a prominent role in the creative direction.

After the [[2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake]] and subsequent [[tsunami]] disaster, Waters performed "[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd song)|Wish You Were Here]]" with Eric Clapton during a benefit concert on the American network [[NBC]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/6828271 |title=Stars lend a hand for tsunami relief |publisher=MSNBC|accessdate= 2 October 2010}}</ref>

In July 2005, Waters reunited with Mason, Wright, and Gilmour for what would be their final performance together at the 2005 Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park, Pink Floyd's only appearance with Waters since their final performance of ''The Wall'' at Earls Court London 24 years earlier.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2008|pp= 237, 266<U+2013>267}}</ref> They played a six-song, 23-minute set including "[[Speak to Me]]/[[Breathe (Pink Floyd song)|Breathe]]"/"[[Time]]"/"[[Breathe (Reprise)]]", "[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]", "Wish You Were Here", and "[[Comfortably Numb]]". Waters told the [[Associated Press]] that while the experience of playing with Pink Floyd again was positive, the chances of a bona fide reunion would be "slight" considering his and Gilmour's continuing musical and ideological differences.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shaffner|1991|p= 308}}</ref> Though Waters had differing ideas about which songs they should play, he "agreed to roll over for one night only".<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp= 382<U+2013>383}}</ref> Gilmour told the Associated Press, "The rehearsals convinced me it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of. There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just that ... I've been there, I've done it."<ref>{{Cite web | title = Gilmour says no Pink Floyd reunion | url = http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/26628516 |publisher= MSNBC| date = 9 September 2008 | accessdate = 6 October 2010}}</ref> In November 2005 Pink Floyd were inducted into the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] by [[Pete Townshend]] of [[The Who]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p= 386}}</ref>

In September 2005, Waters released ''<U+00C7>a Ira'' (pronounced {{IPA-fr|sa i<U+02C8><U+0281>a|}}, [[French language|French]] for "it will be fine"; Waters added the subtitle, "There is Hope"), an opera in three acts translated from the late [[<U+00C9>tienne Roda-Gil]]'s French libretto based on the historical subject of the French Revolution.<ref>{{cite web |last1= Tsioulcas|first1= Anastasia|title= Waters' New Concept |publisher= Billboard |date= 27 August 2005 |page=45 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=-BIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA45&dq=ca+ira+Nadine+Roda-Gil#v=onepage&q=ca%20ira%20Nadine%20Roda-Gil&f=false |accessdate= 18 October 2010 }}</ref> ''<U+00C7>a Ira'' was released as a double CD album, featuring baritone [[Bryn Terfel]], soprano [[Ying Huang]] and tenor [[Paul Groves (tenor)|Paul Groves]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2008|pp= 324<U+2013>325}}</ref> Set during the early French Revolution, the original libretto was co-written in French by Roda-Gil and his wife Nadine Delahaye. Waters had began rewriting the libretto in English in 1989,<ref>{{Harvnb|Manning|2006|p= 256}}</ref> and said about the composition: "I've always been a big fan of Beethoven's choral music, [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] and [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin]]&nbsp;...&nbsp;This is unashamedly romantic and resides in that early 19th-century tradition, because that's where my tastes lie in classical and choral music."<ref name="Blake 2008 392">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p= 392}}</ref> Waters appeared on television to discuss the opera, but the interviews often focused instead on his relationship with Pink Floyd, something Waters would "take in stride", a sign Pink Floyd biographer [[Mark Blake (writer)|Mark Blake]] believes to be, "a testament to his mellower old age or twenty years of dedicated psychotherapy".<ref name="Blake 2008 392"/> ''<U+00C7>a Ira'' reached number 5 on the ''Billboard'' Classical Music Chart in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts#/artist/roger-waters/chart-history/5989?f=900&g=Albums&sort=date |title= Roger Waters: Ca Ira |publisher= Billboard |accessdate= 17 October 2010}}</ref>

In June 2006, Waters commenced [[The Dark Side of the Moon Live]] tour, a two-year, world spanning effort that began in Europe in June and North America in September. The first half of the show featured both Pink Floyd songs and Waters' solo material, while the second half included a complete live performance of the 1973 Pink Floyd album, ''The Dark Side of the Moon'', the first time in over three decades that Waters had performed the album. The shows ended with an encore from the third side of ''The Wall''. He utilised elaborate staging by concert lighting designer [[Marc Brickman]] complete with laser lights, fog machines, flame throwers, psychedelic projections, and inflatable floating puppets (Spaceman and Pig) controlled by a "handler" dressed as a butcher, and a full 360 degree quadrophonic sound system was used. Nick Mason joined Waters for ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' set and the encores on select 2006 tour dates.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2008|pp= 319, 334<U+2013>338}}</ref> Waters continued touring in January 2007 in Australia and New Zealand then Asia, Europe, South America, and back to North America in June. In July 2007, he played on the American leg of the [[Live Earth concert, New York City|Live Earth]] concert, an international multi-venue concert aimed at raising awareness about global climate change, featuring the Trenton Youth Choir and his trademarked inflatable pig. Waters told [[David Fricke]] why he thinks ''The Wall'' is still relevant today:

<blockquote>
The loss of a father is the central prop on which [''The Wall''] stands. As the years go by, children lose their fathers again and again, for nothing. You see it now with all these fathers, good men and true, who lost their lives and limbs in Iraq for no reason at all. I've done Bring The Boys Back Home in my encore on recent tours. It feels more relevant and poignant to be singing that song now than it did in 1979.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fricke|2009|p=74}}</ref>
</blockquote>

In 2007, Waters became a spokesman for [[Millennium Promise]], a non-profit organisation that helps fight extreme poverty and [[malaria]]. He wrote an opinion piece for [[CNN]] in support of the topic.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/06/08/waters.commentary/index.html |title= Waters: Something can be done about extreme poverty|publisher= CNN.com|first=Roger|last=Waters|date=11 June 2007|accessdate= 18 October 2010}}</ref> In March 2007, the Waters song, "Hello (I Love You)" was featured in the science fiction film ''[[The Last Mimzy]]''. The song plays over the film's end credits. He released it as a download-only single, and described it as, "a song that captures the themes of the movie, the clash between humanity's best and worst instincts, and how a child's innocence can win the day".<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_200701/ai_n17103978/ |title= Reminder&nbsp;<U+2013> Pink Floyd Rock Icon Roger Waters Records "Hello (I Love You)", an Original Song for New Line Cinema's "The Last Mimzy" |publisher= [[Marketwire]] |date=January 2007|accessdate= 17 October 2010}}</ref>

==Equipment and instruments==

Waters' primary instrument in Pink Floyd was the electric bass guitar. He briefly played a [[H<U+00F6>fner]] bass but replaced it with a [[Rickenbacker]] RM-1999/4001S,<ref name="POVEY14"/> until around 1970 when he switched to [[Fender Precision Bass]]es. First seen at a concert in Hyde Park, London in July 1970, the black P-Bass was rarely used until April 1972 when it became his main stage guitar and as of 2 October 2010, the basis for a Fender Artist Signature model.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.fender.com/products/search.php?partno=0147000306 |title= Roger Waters Precision Bass<U+00AE> |publisher= Fender.com|accessdate= 9 October 2010}}</ref> Waters endorses [[RotoSound]] Jazz Bass 77 flat-wound strings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rotosound.com/endorsees.html|title=Rotosound Endorsees|publisher=Rotosound|accessdate= 23 November 2010}}</ref> Throughout his career he has used [[The Selmer Company|Selmer]], [[WEM]], [[Hiwatt]] and [[Ashdown Engineering|Ashdown]] amplifiers, also employing [[delay (audio effect)|delay]], [[tremolo]], [[chorus effect|chorus]], [[stereo panning|panning]] and [[Phaser (effect)|phaser]] effects in his music.<ref name="FITCH416<U+2013>430, 441<U+2013>445">{{Harvnb|Fitch|2005|pp=416<U+2013>430, 441-445}}</ref> 

Not only a bassist and vocalist, Waters experimented with the [[EMS Synthi A]] and [[EMS VCS 3|VCS 3]] synthesisers on Pink Floyd pieces such as "[[On the Run (instrumental)|On the Run]]"<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p= 169}}</ref> and "[[Welcome to the Machine]]",<ref>{{Harvnb|Fitch|2005|p= 324}}</ref> and he played electric and acoustic guitar on Pink Floyd tracks using Fender, Martin, Ovation and Washburn guitars.<ref name="FITCH416<U+2013>430, 441<U+2013>445"/> He played electric guitar on the Pink Floyd song "[[Sheep (song)|Sheep]]", from ''Animals'',<ref>{{Harvnb|Fitch|2005|p=285}}</ref> and acoustic guitar on several Pink Floyd recordings, such as [[Pigs on the Wing|"Pigs on the Wing 1&nbsp;&&nbsp;2"]], from ''Animals'',<ref>{{Harvnb|Fitch|2005|pp=241<U+2013>242}}</ref> "[[Southampton Dock]]" from ''The Final Cut'',<ref>{{Harvnb|Fitch|2005|p=295}}</ref> and on "[[Mother (Pink Floyd song)|Mother]]" from ''The Wall''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fitch|2005|p=213}}</ref> A Binson Echorec 2 echo effect was used on his bass-guitar track in "[[One of These Days (Pink Floyd song)|One Of These Days]]".<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabbett|1995|p=39}}</ref>
