'''Chicago Title & Trust Center''' is an office tower located in [[Chicago]] designed by the firm [[Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates]]. The 50 story building rises 756 feet (230 m) in [[Chicago Loop|the Loop]] and was completed in [[1992]].

One of the tower's most notable features is its eastern-facing slanted roof at upper levels. At night, the top of the building facing east and west is flooded with light, creating a memorable presence on the Chicago [[skyline]].

The building was originally intended to have a twin at 181 North Clark Street, but the plan was eventually dropped.
