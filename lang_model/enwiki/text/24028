{{Postmodernism}}
'''Minimalist music''' is an originally American genre of [[experimental music|experimental]] or [[Downtown music]] named in the [[1960s]] based mostly in [[consonance and dissonance|consonant harmony]], steady pulse (if not immobile drones), stasis and slow transformation, and often reiteration of musical [[phrase (music)|phrases]] or smaller units such as [[Figure (music)|figures]], [[Motif (music)|motifs]], and [[Cell (music)|cells]]. Starting in the early 1960s as a scruffy underground scene in San Francisco alternative spaces and New York lofts, minimalism spread to become the most popular experimental music style of the late 20th century. The movement originally involved dozens of composers, although only four - [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Philip Glass]], and, less visibly if more seminally, [[La Monte Young]] - emerged to become publicly associated with it in America. In Europe, its chief exponents were [[Louis Andriessen]], [[Karel Goeyvaerts]],  [[Michael Nyman]], [[Gavin Bryars]], [[Steve Martland]], [[Henryk G<U+00F3>recki]], [[Arvo P<U+00E4>rt]], and [[John Tavener]]. Its emphasis on accessibility, periodic rhythm, consonance, and pleasant and often even pretty sonorities drew millions of fans, especially among pop-music lovers, who had turned away from [[Modernism (music)|modern music]], while simultaneously enraging many classical and academic musicians who saw it as a cheap throwback to a kind of mindless simplicity.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} The term ''minimalist music'' is derived from the concept of [[minimalism]], which was earlier applied to the [[visual arts]]. For some of the music, especially that which transforms itself according to strict rules, the term ''[[process music]]'' has also been used.

The word "minimalism" was first used in relation to music in 1968  by [[Michael Nyman]] in a review of [[Cornelius Cardew]]'s piece ''The Great Digest''. Nyman later expanded his definition of minimalism in music in his 1974  book ''Experimental Music: [[John Cage|Cage]] and Beyond''. [[Tom Johnson (composer)|Tom Johnson]], one of the few composers to self-identify as minimalist, also claims to have been first to use the word as new music critic for ''[[The Village Voice]]''. He describes "minimalism" (1989, 5):

<blockquote>The idea of minimalism is much larger than most people realize. It includes, by definition, any music that works with limited or minimal materials: pieces that use only a few notes, pieces that use only a few words of text, or pieces written for very limited instruments, such as antique cymbals, bicycle wheels, or whiskey glasses. It includes pieces that sustain one basic electronic rumble for a long time. It includes pieces made exclusively from recordings of rivers and streams. It includes pieces that move in endless circles. It includes pieces that set up an unmoving wall of saxophone sound. It includes pieces that take a very long time to move gradually from one kind of music to another kind. It includes pieces that permit all possible pitches, as long as they fall between C and D. It includes pieces that slow the tempo down to two or three notes per minute.</blockquote>

The most prominent minimalist composers are [[John Coolidge Adams|John Adams]], [[Louis Andriessen]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Michael Nyman]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Terry Riley]], and [[La Monte Young]].

There is much variety in the methods and forms of the music called minimal, from instrumentation to [[musical form|structure]] to technique.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} The early compositions of Glass and Reich tended to be very austere, with little embellishment on the principal [[theme (music)|theme]], and written for small instrumental ensembles (of which the composers were members), made up, in Glass's case, of organs, winds&mdash;particularly saxophones&mdash;and vocalists, in Reich's case with more emphasis on mallet and percussion instruments. (These works are scored for any combination of such instruments: one piece by Reich, the aptly named ''Six Pianos'', is scored just so.) Adams' works have most often been written for more traditional [[European classical music|classical]] forces: orchestra, [[string quartet]], even solo piano; there is a minimalist core to his work, but there is also a more traditional philosophy and stylistic diversity behind his compositions, and a phrase in an [[John Coolidge Adams|Adams]] work is less likely to stay unchanged and in the same instrument(s) for a long time than in would be in another minimalist's work.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} 

Relevance of minimalist music's relation to the eponymous art and sculpture movement is often disputed, but they both share a predilection for simple, obvious forms, strict geometry, and the avoidance of expressive decoration.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} The music of Reich and Glass drew early sponsorship from art galleries and museums, presented in conjunction with visual-art minimalists like [[Sol LeWitt]]. One aspect that the music and art may have in common is their (at least conceptual) lack of purely decorative variations. {{Fact|date=June 2007}}

==Early development== 
Musical minimalism had its origins in both [[conceptualism]] and [[twelve-tone music]]. The first identifiably minimalist work is the 1958 String Trio by [[La Monte Young]].{{Fact|date=June 2007}} The piece is written using twelve-tone technique, but the notes are extended to tremendous length; the first note is sustained (at notated tempo) for four minutes and 33 seconds. Subsequent to the String Trio, he began making other musical works based on long drones and harmonics played above them, culminating in his improvisation group The Theater of Eternal Music.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} 

In 1960, [[Terry Riley]] wrote a string quartet in pure, uninflected C major. In 1963 Riley made two electronic works using tape delay, ''Mescalin Mix'' and ''The Gift'', which injected into minimalism the idea of repetition. Next, Riley's 1964 masterpiece [[In C]] made persuasively engaging textures from repeated phrases in performance. The work is scored for any group of instruments. In in 1965 and 1966 [[Steve Reich]] produced three works<U+2014>''[[It's Gonna Rain]]'' and ''[[Come Out (Reich)|Come Out]]'' for tape, and ''[[Piano Phase]]'' for live performers<U+2014>that introduced the idea of phase-shifting, i.e., allowing two nearly identical phrases or sound samples at slightly differing lengths or speeds to repeat and slowly go out of phase with each other. Starting in 1968 with ''1 + 1'', Philip Glass wrote a series of works that incorporated additive process (form based on sequences such as 1, 1 2, 1 2 3, 1 2 3 4) into the repertoire of minimalist techniques; these works included ''Two Pages'', ''Music in Fifths'', ''Music in Contrary Motion'', and others. By this point, the minimalist style was in full swing.

==Minimalist style in music== 
[[Kyle Gann]] has identified 9 traits common in minimalist music, none of them present in all pertinent examples, but together defining the historical outlines of the style:<ref>[http://www.newmusicbox.org/page.nmbx?id=31tp01 Kyle Gann, "Minimal Music, Maximal Impact: Thankless Attempts at a Definition of Minimalism"]</ref>

#Static harmony (a tendency to stay on one chord, or to move back and forth among a small repertoire of chords);
#Repetition of brief motives (the most widely recognized minimalist stereotype, though absent from Young's sine-tone installations, Tony Conrad's violin improvisations, Jon Gibson's permutational pieces, Phill Niblock's drone works, and other seminal examples of the style)
#Algorithmic, linear, geometric, or gradual processes (such as pattern augmentation by 1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4 and so on, systematic permutation of the type Jon Gibson used, or the phase-shifting or repeating loops of Reich's 1960s works)
#A steady beat (often motoric, but sometimes simply restricted to a small repertoire of durations)
#Static instrumentation (everyone playing all the time, an ensemble concept in which everyone participates equally)
#"Metamusic" (unplanned acoustic details that arise or are perceived as a side effect of strictly carried-out processes, as in Reich's ''Drumming'' and ''Octet'')
#Pure tuning, or [[just intonation]] (common in the early minimalism of Young, Conrad, Niblock, and Riley but abandoned in the more public Reich/Glass practice)
#Influence of non-Western musics or cultures (Young, Riley, and Glass were inspired by Indian classical music, Reich studied African drumming)
#The substance of the piece should be apparent and not rely on hidden or secret elements/concepts for impact. Of value in this style is the availability of the sounds and structure to the listener.

Some of these traits have precedents in the history of European music&mdash;[[Richard Wagner]], for instance, opened his opera [[Das Rheingold]] with several minutes of static tonality on an E-flat chord, with a linear crescendo of figurations.  

Consonant harmony is a much noted feature: it means the use of intervals which in a [[tonal]] context would be considered to be "stable", that is the form to which other chords are resolved by [[voice leading]]. In minimalism this function of stability is ignored.

Another trait of the minimalist movement established at an early point in time is the use of ''phase'' in consonant context to provide variety. A famous example is [[Terry Riley]]'s ''In C'' which gives musicians fragments of music which they are to play at their own pace until they stop. The resulting texture varies with the different choices that performers make.

This means that the "texture" of much minimalist music is based on [[canonic imitation]], exact repetitions of the same material, offset in time. Famous pieces that use this technique are the ''number'' section of Glass' ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]'' and Adams' ''[[Shaker Loops]]''.

Over time minimalist composers adopted more and more chromatic material for repetition, for example Philip Glass' ''Symphony No. 2'', and the operas of [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]. There was also an increasing movement to incorporate found sounds, tape, electric or electronic sources of music. Minimalism in classical music often cross fertilizes with popular experimental music, such as the work of [[Brian Eno]] and [[Mike Oldfield]], as well as [[electronica]] and [[house (music)|house]], where DJs layer different recordings on top of each other without regard for their source.

The development of minimalist music proceeds as a movement which was consciously aware of its being a post-serialist movement in music, drawing from the use of silence and layering in Cage, but seeking a more melodic basis for its materials. Many of the individual traits of minimalist music occur in serial works of the same period, for example the use of layering in [[Luciano Berio|Berio's]] ''[[Sinfonia (Berio)|Sinfonia]]'', or the long suspended tones of [[Morton Feldman]].

These traits were also the feature of composers who rejected 20th century chromatic harmony for other reasons, often liturgical or religious. These composers often went back to Medieval and early Renaissance harmony and practice more deliberately, producing works which had more formally worked out canonic imitation in a [[musical mode|modal]] rather than tonal context.  An early exponent here was the once popular American [[Alan Hovhaness]] (in his works of the 1940s and 50s), but more recently [[Arvo P<U+00E4>rt]] is one who has gained a wide following and had numerous recordings and performances of his work.

Minimalism is sometimes associated with an ideology that justifies the moving away from the greater complexity of [[modernism]] by arguing from the point of view of [[postmodernism]]. Specifically, postmodernism states that progress in music is illusory, and therefore there is no need to have ever more advanced and complex systems of composing, that the purpose of minimalist music is repose, rather than "western" style development, and that minimalism embodies more "eastern" values of meditation, trance and concentration. Philip Glass specifically argues that there has been a disintegration of the concept of "high" and "low" music, and that music of this movement is important because it allows incorporation of, and dialog with, popular styles in a way that previous music did not. These arguments are far from universal among listeners, composers and performers of minimalist music, but are commonly cited in the struggles for performance, attention and acceptance of minimalist music.

Minimalist music is frequently used in movie scores and other media to provide a backdrop or mood for a particular scene or opening, or as an episode in a score. It has been adopted for sections of work by composers from other styles, including the late work of [[Lukas Foss]].

There is a branch of British minimalism called [[systems music]] in which the note-to-note procedure is determined numerically or through a specific physical process like systematically changing the phase of electronically produced sine waves.  The term was used informally<!--Please name some of the U.S. writers who purportedly used this term in reference to minimalism.--> as a term for all minimalism in the 1980s (due to Michael Nyman's popularity).

== Critical reception of minimalism ==
[[Ian MacDonald]] (MacDonald 2003) sums up a common, classical-music traditionalist view that minimalism is the passionless, sexless and emotionally blank soundtrack of the [[Machine Age]], its utopian selfishness no more than an expression of human passivity in the face of [[mass-production]] and [[The Bomb]]. A pulse-rhythm is an artificial substitute for the energy of conviction and its 'effects' due not to any effort from artist or audience, but to a negative process of deliberate self-denial. As a music without focus or [[hierarchy]], it is also  without goal or struggle, as inert as the pre-planned corporate lifestyle for which it is the perfect accompaniment. 

On the other hand, Kyle Gann has argued that minimalism represented a predictable return to simplicity after the development of an earlier style had run its course to an extreme and unsurpassable complexity.<ref>Kyle Gann, <U+2018><U+2019>American Music in the Twentieth Century<U+2019><U+2019>, pp. 184-5</ref> Parallels include the advent of the simple Baroque [[continuo]] style following elaborate [[Renaissance]] [[polyphony]] and the simple early classical [[symphony]] following [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]<U+2019>s monumental advances in Baroque [[counterpoint]]. In addition, critics have often overstated the simplicity of even early minimalism. Michael Nyman has pointed out that much of the charm of [[Steve Reich]]<U+2019>s early music had to do with perceptual phenomena that were not actually played, but resulted from subtleties in the phase-shifting process.<ref>Michael Nyman, <U+2018><U+2019>Experimental Music: Cage and Beyond<U+2019><U+2019>, pp. 133-4</ref> He quotes Reich to the effect that although 

<blockquote>everyone hears what is gradually happening in a musical process there are still enough mysteries to satisfy all. These mysteries are the impersonal, unintended, psycho-acoustic by-products of the intended process.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}</blockquote> 

Something similar could be said of the musics of [[Phill Niblock]] and [[Tony Conrad]], whose minimalism does not at all fit the Glass/Reich stereotype of diatonic scale and steady pulse.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Gann has further argued that the development of music represented by [[serialism]] was a one-sided development that focused on analytical elements and structural innovations often easier to identify in the score than to hear. In this respect, minimalism offered a complementary return to more subtle acoustical and perceptual phenomena.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} In Gann's further analysis, during the 1980s minimalism evolved into less strict, more complex styles such as [[postminimalism]] and [[totalism]], breaking out of the strongly framed repetition and stasis of early minimalism, and enriching it with a confluence of other rhythmic and structural influences.<ref>[http://www.newmusicbox.org/article.nmbx?id=1536 Kyle Gann, "Minimal Music, Maximal Impact: Minimalism's Immediate Legacy: Postminimalism"]</ref>

A number of composers showing a distinctly religious influence have been labeled the "mystic minimalists", or "[[holy minimalism|holy minimalists]]":
*[[Henryk G<U+00F3>recki]]
*[[Alan Hovhaness]] (the earliest mystic minimalist)
*[[Hans Otte]]
*[[Arvo P<U+00E4>rt]]
*[[John Tavener]]
*[[Peteris Vasks]]
*[[Giya Kancheli]]

Other composers whose works have been described as precedents to minimalism include:
*[[Jakob van Domselaer]], whose early-20th century experiments in translating the theories of [[Piet Mondrian]]'s [[De Stijl]] movement into music represent an early precedent to minimalist music.
*[[Alexander Mosolov]], whose orchestral composition ''Iron Foundry'' (1923) is made up of mechanical and repetitive patterns
*[[George Antheil]], whose 1924 ''Ballet Mecanique'' is characterized by much use of motoric and repetitive patterns, as well as an instrumentation made up of multiple player pianos and mallet percussion
*[[Erik Satie]], seen as a precursor of minimalism as in much of his music, for example his score for [[Francis Picabia]]'s 1924 film ''Entr'acte'' which consists of phrases, many borrowed from bawdy popular songs, ordered seemingly arbitrarily and repetitiously, providing a rhythmic counterpoint to the film.
*[[Colin McPhee]], whose ''Tabuh-Tabuhan'' for two pianos and orchestra (1936) features the use of motoric, repetitive, pentatonic patterns drawn from the music of Bali (and featuring a large section of tuned percussion)
*[[Carl Orff]], who, particularly in his later theater works [[Antigone (opera)|Antigone]] (1940-49) and [[Oedipus der Tyrann]] (1957-58), utilized instrumentations (six pianos and multiple xylophones, in imitation of gamelan music) and musical patterns (motoric, repetitive, triadic) reminiscent of the later music of [[Steve Reich]] and [[Philip Glass]]
*[[Yves Klein]], whose [[1947]] ''Monotone Symphony'' consisted of a single sustained chord, predating similar works by La Monte Young by several years.
*[[Morton Feldman]], whose works prominently feature some sort of repetition as well as a sparseness
*[[Alvin Lucier]], whose acoustical experiments demand a stripped-down musical surface to bring out details in the phenomena
