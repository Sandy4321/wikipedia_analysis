"'''Empire of Dreams'''" (1988) is a [[postmodern]] [[poetry]] [[classic]] by [[Giannina Braschi]], who is widely considered "one of the most [[revolutionary]] voices in [[Latin American literature]]" today".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/bookfest/author/giannina_braschi|title=Giannina Braschi|work=National Book Festival|publisher=Library of Congress|year=2012|quote="Braschi, one of the most revolutionary voices in Latin America today."}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Modern Language Association Presents Giannina Braschi|quote ="Considered one of the most revolutionary Latin American poets writing today, Giannina Braschi, author of the epic prose poem 'Empire of Dreams'."|url=http://circumferencemag.org/?event=modern-language-association-presents-giannina-braschi|website=Circumference Magazine: Poetry in Translation, Academy of American Poets|date =January 1, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=World Literature in Translation: Giannina Braschi<U+2019>s Empire of Dreams|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/reviews.asp?isbn=9780300057959&printer=y|website=Yale University Press|quote="Braschi's book is a modern classic, informed with all of the major concerns of our contemporary culture."|date=August 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=PEN: Free Expression/Literature|url=https://www.pen.org/giannina-braschi|website=PEN American Center|quote="Giannina Braschi, one of the most revolutionary voices in Latin America today, wrote the postmodern poetry classic EMPIRE OF DREAMS."|date=November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=D<U+2019>Amore, Anna Maria|title=<U+2018>Translating Contemporary Mexican Texts: Fidelity to Alterity<U+2019>|quote="In the stakes of literary acclaim and respectability is Giannina Braschi, considered by many to be Puerto Rico<U+2019>s premier poet."|publisher=Berkeley Insights in Linguistics and Semiotics|place=New York|page=104|date=2009}}</ref>

Forming a hybrid of [[prose poetry]], [[drama]], [[musical theater]], [[manifesto]], [[gossip]], [[autobiography]], [[diary]], [[literary theory]], and [[antinovel]], "Empire of Dreams" is a mixed genre [[trilogy]] on the culture of excess.

The central axis of this [[epic poem]] is the Latin American [[immigrant]]'s optimistic new life in the "[[Big Apple]]", which is dramatized by Braschi as the epicenter of the [[American Dream]].  However, social and linguistic references to other [[International|transnational]] Latin cities abound, such as "the Latin American Quarter in Paris, the barrio chino barcelon<U+00E9>s, the zaguanes of Borges's Buenos Aires, and the colonial houses in Old San Juan".<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink=Carrion, Maria Mercedes|title=<U+2018>Geography, (M)Other Tongues and the Role of Translation in Giannina Braschi<U+2019>s El imperio de los sue<U+00F1>os<U+2019>|quote= "the Latin American Quarter in Paris, the barrio chino barcelon<U+00E9>s, the zaguanes of Borges's Buenos Aires, and the colonial houses in Old San Juan".|journal=Studies in 20th Century Literature|volume=20|pages=167<U+2013>192|date=1996}}</ref>

"Empire of Dreams" debuted in Spain to acclaim as "El imperio de los sue<U+00F1>os" in 1988, with an English translation by Tess O'Dwyer later inaugurating the [[Yale]] Library of World Literature in Translation (1994).<ref>{{Citation|last=Barnstone|first1=Willis|title=Literature of Asia, Africa, and Latin America: From Antiquity to the Present|quote="Empire of Dreams is an epic length sequence of poems published to acclaim"<U+2026>/"brightest new voice in her generation in the Spanish language."|place=Saddle River, NJ|publisher=Prentice Hall|page=1954|date=1994}}</ref>  Composed from 1980 to 1986, this series represents the first major phase of Braschi's [[oeuvre]]: poetry written entirely in classical and modern Spanish.

==Subject, Structure, and Themes==

"Empire of Dreams" deals with issues of artistic creation, [[immigration]], commercialism, [[capitalism]], [[identity crisis]], sexual and gender ambiguity, and [[revolution]]. The narrator journeys  through a "phantasmagoria of internal and external trials in order to experience the center<U+2014>of political power, of meaning, of feeling, and of personal identity".<ref>{{cite web|title=http://www.yalebooks.com/reviews.asp?isbn=9780300057959|title=Yale University Press Reviews|quote="New York City becomes the site of liberation for its marginal citizens, as the narrator is led through a seeming phantasmagoria of internal and external trials in order to experience the center<U+2014>of political power, of meaning, of feeling, and of personal identity."|date=August 1994}}</ref>

The work has been compared structurally to the [[Chinese boxes|Chinese box]] and the [[Matryoshka doll]], given that the book has six books inside.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title= Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Literature|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Hispanic-American Literature|volume=5|pages=429|publisher=Infobase Learning|date=August 31, 2008|isbn =9781438140605}}</ref>

Part one, "Assault on Time," is a sequence of meditative prose poems on the subject of love lost and the ineptitude of language and grammar to communicate emotions.  It is Braschi<U+2019>s first book of poetry<ref>{{cite web|title=http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/2012/09/14/1ea74c24-f2e4-11e1-a612-3cfc842a6d89mar_story.html/|title=The Washington Post|quote="Giannina Braschi<U+2019>s first published work was a book of poetry,"Asalto al tiempo"; since then she has had essays, a novella and more poetry published in Spanish. She went on to write the novel "Yo-Yo Boing!" in Spanglish. Her new novel is her first in English "United States of Banana."|date=November 2012}}</ref> and it begins with the breaking of silence: "Behind the word is silence./Behind what sounds is the door."<ref>{{cite book|author=Braschi, Giannina|title=<U+2018>Empire of Dreams<U+2019> translated by Tess O<U+2019>Dwyer|quote="Behind the word is silence./Behind what sounds is the door"|publisher=Yale University Press|place=New Haven, CT|page=1|isbn=9780300057959|date=1994}}</ref> Letters take on a life of their own, roaming the streets of New York, and punctuation marks, such as colons and [[semicolon]]s denote pivotal points in a relationship.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Literature|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Hispanic-American Literature|volume=5|pages=429|publisher=Infobase Learning|date=August 31, 2008|isbn =9781438140605}}</ref>

Part two, "Profane Comedy," turns loud as the poet pays homage to the evolution of poetry and performance, especially [[comedia dell'arte]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Ostriker|first=Alicia|title=Introduction to Empire of Dreams|quote="Profane Comedy is an homage to performance, especially comedia dell'arte."|place=New Haven, CT|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=x-xx1|date=1994}}</ref> "Profane Comedy" is composed of four books of poetry, each with humorous gusto and a flair for the grotesque:   1. "Book of Clowns and Buffoons", 2. "Poems of the World; or The Book of Wisdom", 3. "Pastoral; or, The Inquisition of Memories", and 4. "Song of Nothingness".  Throughout, Braschi intermingles television [[jingles]] and pop songs by the likes of [[The Beatles]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] with poems of the [[Spanish Golden Age]].  References include [[Luis de Le<U+00F3>n]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Luis de G<U+00F3>ngora]], [[Garcilaso de la Vega]] , and [[Francisco Quevedo]], while cameo appearances are made by poets, painters, philosophers, and composers, such as:  [[C<U+00E9>sar Vallejo]], [[Rimbaud]], [[Goethe]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Breughal]], [[Beethoven]], [[Van Gogh]], and [[Picasso]], among others. Quotations of classical poets abound, transformed by the appropriating hand of a joyful poet who uses the "sampling technique of rap music" and [[hip hop]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Ostriker|first=Alicia|title=Introduction to "Empire of Dreams"|place=New Haven, CT|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=x-xx1|date=1994}}</ref> Though Braschi writes with a strong literary tradition behind her and from an erudite standpoint, "she imbues her text with jollity and a brilliant energy."<ref>{{Citation|last=Kuebler|first=Caroline|title="Empire of Dreams" Review|quote="Braschi writes with a strong poetic tradition behind her, and from her erudite standpoint she forges an odd mixture of poetry, prose, drama, and a little of what could be considered music.

Part three, "Intimate Diary of Solitude," is a lighthearted [[antinovel]] that mocks the [[Latin American Boom]] and [[dictator novel]]s.  The composition is a mix-mash of [[flash fiction]], pop songs, [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]], [[Advertising|commercials]], diary excerpts, political and literary [[manifestos]], performance art, ending with a philosophical treatise on the writer<U+2019>s role in the modern age.  The heroine Mariquita Samper, a [[Macy's]] make-up artist who dreams of being a star, calls for a [[revolution]] of "poetic eggs" and shoots the [[narrator]] of Latin American Boom novels (such as [[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]) who keeps rewriting her own diary in order to turn it into a bestseller.<ref>{{Citation|last=Marting|first1=Diane|title= New/Nueva York in Giannina Braschi's 'Poetic Egg': Fragile Identity, Postmodernism, and Globalization|place=Indiana|publisher=The Global South|pages=167<U+2013>182|date=2010}}</ref> The debate between quality and originality versus fame and fortune is a constant theme in "Empire of Dreams".  The work closes with a quotation from an anonymous poem of [[Medieval Spanish literature]], a line from "El Conde Arnaldos": "I only sing my song/to whomever follows me."<ref>{{cite book|author=Braschi, Giannina|title=Empire of Dreams|publisher=AmazonCrossing|place=Seattle|page=197|ISBN=9781611090659|date=2011}}</ref>

==Influences==
Giannina Braschi credits T.S. Eliot<U+2019>s "[[The Waste Land]]" as the single most impactful English language poem to inform the rhythmic shifts and the inspiration from which she creates a chorus of anonymous voices to capture the collective conscience of the masses.<ref>{{cite interview|last=Braschi|first=Giannina|interviewer=Rathke, Eric J.|title=52 Weeks / 52 Interviews: Week 34: Giannina Braschi|quote="I<U+2019>ve studied music all my life.
