'''''Trembling Before G-d''''' is a [[2001 in film|2001]] [[documentary film]] about [[gay]] and [[lesbian]] [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] trying to reconcile their sexuality with their faith. It was directed by [[Sandi Simcha DuBowski]], who wanted to compare Orthodox attitudes to homosexuality with his own upbringing as a gay Conservative Jew. The film won several awards, including [[Teddy Award]] for Best Documentary Film at the 2001 [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin Film Festival]], the 2001 [[Chicago International Film Festival]], and the 2003 [[GLAAD Media Awards]].

The film follows the lives of several gay and lesbian Orthodox Jews and includes interviews with [[rabbi]]s and psychotherapists about Orthodox attitudes towards homosexuality.  During the film's six-year production, DuBowski met hundreds of homosexual Jews but only a handful agreed to be filmed out of fear of being ostracized from their communities.<ref name="NYT"/>  Many people who agreed to be interviewed are shown only in [[silhouette]] or with their faces [[pixelization|pixelized]].<ref name="Rechtshaffen" />

Several Orthodox synagogues sponsored showings of the film;<ref name= "Director"/> however, no [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Orthodox groups spoke out in favor of the film. Traditionally, Orthodox Judaism has prohibited homosexual conduct, as it was believed people became homosexual in order to spite God, to be perverse, or because of a [[mental illness]].  In the last couple of decades, positions on homosexuality have became more sympathetic.<ref name="cinema verite" />  However, Haredi Judaism, the most conservative form of Orthodox Judaism, still views homosexuality as a perversion.  As a result of the positive responses received from homosexual Orthodox Jews, however, the creators of the film have set up several organizations to teach Orthodox educators and rabbis about homosexuality.<ref name="USA" />

== Background ==

{{Main|Homosexuality and Judaism}}

While a variety of views regarding homosexuality exist within the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] community, Orthodox Judaism generally prohibits homosexual conduct. While there is disagreement about which acts come under core prohibitions, all of Orthodox Judaism puts certain core homosexual acts, including male-male [[anal sex]] in the category of ''yehareg ve'al ya'avor'', "die rather than transgress", the small category of Biblically prohibited acts (also including murder, idolatry, adultery, and incest) which an Orthodox Jew is obligated under [[Self-sacrifice under Jewish Law|Jewish laws on self-sacrifice]] to die rather than commit.<ref>Dorff, Elliot; Nevins, Daniel and  Reisner, Avram ([[December 6]], [[2006]]), [http://www.rabbinevins.org/HHH%20Dorff%20Nevins%20Reisner%20Final2.pdf Homosexuality, Human Dignity, and Halakha], The Committee on Jewish Law and Standards. Retrieved [[March 9]], [[2007]].</ref>

Until recently, followers of [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] believed homosexuals chose to engage in homosexual actions in order to spite God, to be perverse, or because of a mental illness.  Familiarity with [[sociology|sociological]] and [[biology|biological]] studies, as well as personal contact with Jewish homosexuals, has brought some Orthodox leaders to a more sympathetic viewpoint. In the [[1974]] yearbook of the ''Encyclopedia Judaica'', Rabbi [[Norman Lamm]], a leader in Modern Orthodox Judaism invoked the principle of [[halakha|Jewish law]] termed ''ones'', denoting an "accident" or event beyond one's control.<ref>Lamm, Norman, [http://www.jonahweb.org/cms/e/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=78&Itemid=42 Judaism and the Modern Attitude to Homosexuality], Jonahweb.org. Retrieved [[March 9]], [[2007]].</ref> In this way, Lamm argued, homosexuality could be redefined as an act performed under psychological duress, and it would be wrong to persecute or judge homosexuals for their actions. 

Many within the Jewish community continue to view homosexuality as a perversion. When an Orthodox Rabbi, [[Steven Greenberg (rabbi)|Steven Greenberg]], publicly announced that he was homosexual, there was a significant response from rabbis of all denominations reported in Jewish newspapers. Rabbi [[Moshe David Tendler|Moshe Tendler]], a leading rabbi at the Modern Orthodox [[Yeshiva University]], stated "It is very sad that an individual who attended our yeshiva sunk to the depths of what we consider a depraved society" claiming that Rabbi Greenberg's announcement is "the exact same as if he said, 'I'm an Orthodox Rabbi and I eat [[Unclean animals#Judaism|ham sandwiches]] on [[Yom Kippur]].' What you are is a Reform Rabbi."<ref>Israelwire.com ([[May 18]], [[1999]]), [http://web.archive.org/web/20000306064752/http://www.israelwire.com/New/990518/99051844.html Rabbi Ordained by Yeshiva University Announces He is Gay].

There is no narration and the film may be considered to be an example of [[cin<U+00E9>ma v<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>]]. The film is also interspersed with silhouetted tableaus of Jewish religious practices, for example [[Shabbat]].<ref name="Barry" /> The language is predominantly [[English language|English]], with passages in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] that are [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitle]]d.

The title is an allusion to the word ''Haredi'' ({{lang-he|<U+05D7><U+05B2><U+05E8><U+05B5><U+05D3><U+05B4><U+05D9>}}), which can be interpreted as "one who trembles" in awe of God.<ref>Monserrate, Carey ([[March 22]], [[2004]]), [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-118880771.html Trembling Playground: two young directors discuss film, faith, and the challenges of documenting religion.], ''CrossCurrents'' magazine.

== Synopsis ==

''Trembling Before G-d'' interviews and follows several gay and lesbian Orthodox Jews, many only as silhouettes, as well as interviewing several rabbis and psychologists about views on homosexuality in Orthodox Judaism. The film repeatedly returns to several characters:

David is an observant Orthodox Jewish doctor from LA who has spent a decade trying to reconcile his homosexuality with Judaism. He has been through every form of "treatment" to cure him, from eating figs and praying to wearing an [[Rubber band|elastic band]] on his wrist to flick whenever he thinks of men, but to no avail.<ref name="Rechtshaffen">Rechtshaffen, Michael ([[February 25]], [[2002]]), [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1353371 Trembling before G-d], Hollywoodreporter.com.

Israel is a 58-year-old New Yorker who decided he couldn't be gay and Orthodox, and turned his back on his religion, though not before his family forced him into [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] to try to cure him. Now a [[tour guide]] around the Haredi neighborhoods of New York, the film follows him as he gives a tour, psychoanalyses himself and decides, on the 25th anniversary of being with his [[life partner]], to call his 98 year old father, a rabbi, whom he has not seen in over twenty years.<ref name="LA Times">Thomas, Kevin ([[February 20]], [[2002]]), [http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie000013084feb20,0,2776571.story 'Trembling Before G-d': A documentary by Sandi Simcha DuBowski looks at the conflict between honoring one's religion and sexual orientation.], ''Los Angeles Times''.

Rabbi [[Steven Greenberg (rabbi)|Steven Greenberg]] is the first openly gay Orthodox rabbi, and discusses parents' reactions to their children [[coming out]], as well as traditional interpretations of the prohibitions on homosexual acts in the [[Torah]]. Rabbi Greenberg also founded Open House, a [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]] organization in Israel which provides support to gay Orthodox Jews and their families.

They speak frankly about their lives in the film and discuss their fears that they may not end up in heaven together. They are shown preparing for Shabbat, and Leah gives advice to a married Hasidic lesbian who is terrified her husband will find out and take away her children.<ref name="LA Times" />

"Devorah" is a married Hasidic lesbian living in Israel. She only appears as a silhouette with an electronically modified voice.

''Trembling Before G-d'' has had a wide impact especially within the Orthodox Jewish world, where the reception has been roundly negative.

No Haredi Orthodox group spoke out in favor of ''Trembling Before G-d''. The spokesperson for [[Agudath Israel of America]], one of the largest Haredi organizations, Rabbi [[Avi Shafran]], attacked the film with an article titled "Dissembling Before G-d".  In his response, he holds that gay people can be cured through therapy, and that the movie is meant to promote homosexuality:

{{quotation|Unfortunately, though, "Trembling" seems to have other intents as well. While it never baldly advocates the case for broader societal acceptance of homosexuality or for the abandonment of elements of the Jewish religious tradition, those causes are subtly evident in the stark, simplistic picture the film presents of sincere, conflicted and victimized men and women confronted by a largely stern and stubborn cadre of rabbis.<br /><br />That picture is both incomplete and distorted. For starters, the film refuses to even allow for the possibility that men and women with homosexual predilections might - with great effort, to be sure - achieve successful and happy marriages to members of the opposite sex.|<ref>Shafran, Avi, [http://www.tremblingbeforeg-d.com/react/agudath.html Dissembling Before G-d - The Agudath Israel Response]. Retrieved [[February 18]], [[2007]].</ref>}}

However, DuBowski maintains that there is no agenda to ''Trembling Before G-d'' "beyond alleviating an immense amount of pain that people are going through", and that Judaism is lovingly portrayed. Indeed, the love of Judaism in the film is so emphasized that several audience members asked afterwards how they could convert.<ref name="eye">Linekin, Kate ([[July 18]], [[2002]]), [http://www.eye.net/eye/issue/issue_07.18.02/film/tremblingbeforeg-d.html A twist of faith: Trembling Before G-d], Eye.net.
