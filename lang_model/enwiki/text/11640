'''Hamburg''' is a [[town]] in [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]], [[New York]], [[United States]].  As of the 2010 census, the town had a total population of 56,936.

The '''Town of Hamburg''' is on the western border of the county and is south of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York. Hamburg is one of the "Southtowns" in Erie County. A village called [[Hamburg (village), New York|Hamburg]] and a village called [[Blasdell, New York|Blasdell]] are in the town.

==History==
Historical evidence<ref>[http://www.townofhamburgny.com/about_the_town.asp Town of Hamburg - History]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref> shows that the area was settled originally by the Erie Indians.

===19th century===
Around 1805 the settlement was known as Barkerville, named after Zenas Barker, the postmaster. On the site of this building today is the Dock at the Bay. The first landowner in the area was John Cummings, who built the first grist mill in 1806.

The Town of Hamburg was formed by government decree on March 20, 1812, from the (now defunct) [[Willink, New York|Town of Willink]]. The first town meeting took place on April 7, 1812, at Jacob Wright's Tavern at Wright's Corners, which was renamed to Abbott's Corners, and now Armor. One of the early noted activities of the Town Board in that same year was to place a $5 bounty on wolf hides, due to the complaints of the local settlers who were being bothered by them.

In 1815, mail routes were established. The earliest settlers in the area were from New England. Germans started arriving in the 1830s and set up many successful farms.

On November 29, 1824, a meeting was held in Abbott's Corners, at the home of early settler Seth Abbott. At a vote of those present, agreement was reached to form a library with the sum of $102.<ref>[http://www.buffalolib.org/libraries/hamburg/history/ A History of the Hamburg Public Library]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref>

By 1850, the town was reduced by the formation of the Towns of [[Orchard Park (town), New York|Orchard Park]] and [[West Seneca (town), New York|West Seneca]].

Around 1852, the [[Erie Railroad]] was built through the area. In 1868 the [[Erie County Fair]] came to the town and has been located there since then. In 1875 the weekly publication of the ''Erie County Independent'' began. This is now known as ''The Sun''. Telephone service in the area started in 1886.

The Village of Hamburg set itself off from the town in 1874 by incorporating as a village.

In 1897, a group of women known as the Nineteenth Century Club started a permanent free public library, known as the Hamburg Free Library. Until 1901 it was located in various rented buildings.

Starting in 1890 and to support the growing regional steel industry, Polish and Italians began to arrive in the area.<ref>[http://www.history.rays-place.com/ny/hamburg-ny.htm History of Hamburg]</ref>

In 1898, the community of Blasdell set itself apart from the town by incorporating as a village.

===20th century===
The Hamburg Free Library was moved into a Carnegie library on Center Street on November 8, 1915, where it remained until 1966 when the current library at 102 Buffalo Street was opened.

A trolley car system was established in the early 1900s.

In the mid-1970s, the Village of Hamburg became one of the first communities in the nation to have compulsory curbside recycling.

The [[Kleis Site]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1979.<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>

===21st century===
In 2003, Joseph Haptas, a spokesman from the animal rights group [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) approached then-Town Supervisor Patrick Hoak and asked him to have the name of Hamburg changed to Veggieburg. Haptas offered the Hamburg School District $15,000 in free [[veggie burgers]] as an incentive for the name change. Hoak declined the name change in the wake of fierce public and government opposition and PETA backed down.<ref>WYKC http://www.wkyc.com/news/story.aspx?storyid=5149</ref>

In July 2012, Main Street in the Village of Hamburg from Lake Street to Buffalo Street was granted state approval for nomination as a [[National Register of Historic Places property types#Historic districts|national historic district]].<ref>[http://www.thesunnews.net/scene/527-Hamburgs_Main_Street_nominated__to_become_national_historic_district.html Hamburg<U+2019>s Main Street nominated to become national historic district | Scene |News Classifieds Events | thesunnews.net<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Geography==
