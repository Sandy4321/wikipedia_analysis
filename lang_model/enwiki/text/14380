'''''Satan's Harvest Home''''' is a [[pamphlet]] published anonymously in 1749 in [[London]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. It describes and denounces what it deems the [[Morality|moral laxity]] and [[perversion]] of contemporary society, especially with reference to [[effeminacy]], [[sodomy]], and [[prostitution]]. The pamphlet incorporates some older material; this attempts to diagnose the cause of a perceived increase in the prevalence of sodomy among gentlemen, and specifies a continental European origin for male effeminacy and female same-sex relations. The pamphlet also features a poem, "Petit Ma<U+00EE>tre", denouncing male habits of feminine dress. 

Contemporary scholars have found in the pamphlet evidence of several [[Early Modern Britain|Early Modern British]] trends: the equation of effeminacy with [[homosexuality]]; the use of [[Sappho]] as a symbol for [[lesbianism]] at a time when public awareness of lesbian relationships was increasing; and an equation of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Italy and France with [[Morality|moral]] degeneracy.

==="Reasons for the Growth of Sodomy"===
In a section apparently reprinted from earlier publications,<ref name="Rictor"/><ref name="Haggerty"/> the pamphlet discerns "Reasons for the Growth of Sodomy" in a number of aspects of British culture. It claims that, in past ages, British middle-class gentlemen had led moral, industrious lives, serving King, country, and family. This era, the pamphlet claims, was now past and lost; the constitution of the gentleman has deteriorated.<ref name="Edelman">{{Cite book |first=Lee |last=Edelman |title=Homographesis |page=122 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E3Qs_bUDvS8C&pg=PA121&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22 |publisher=Routledge |year=1994 |isbn=0415902592 }}</ref> Contemporary infants, it says, faced grim prospects, being pampered in nurseries by mothers who dominated their weak fathers.<ref name="Dowling"/> Such children, the pamphlet argued, could not help but to grow up effete and were "scarcely worth raising". Some of the blame for this, the pamphlet claims, lay with the increasing popularity of raising children at home, and having them educated by women, rather than sending them to school or to be apprenticed. Lacking the boisterous companionship of other boys they could not acquire manly traits;<ref>{{Cite book |first=David F. |last=Greenberg |title=The construction of homosexuality |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tSJkCFH11YcC&pg=PA389&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22&lr= |page=389 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1999 |isbn=0226306283 }}</ref> governed by women, they never learned to dominate women themselves, which, the pamphlet claimed, was requisite to please a wife.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Roger |last=Lancaster |title=The gender/sexuality reader |page=186 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VWd7B_KuD5YC&pg=PA186&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22&lr= |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |isbn=0415910056 }}</ref>

===Male effeminacy and sodomy===
<!-- Capitalization and italics in quotes are all from the original text- please do not amend them to modern style. -->
One chapter of the pamphlet describes the [[physiognomy]] of the "sodomitical type",<ref name="SHH"/> claiming that gentle, soft, and delicate men are predisposed toward sodomy.<ref name="Rousseau">{{Cite book |first=George Sebastian |last=Rousseau |title=Perilous enlightenment |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6QoNAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA19&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22 |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1991 |isbn=0719033012 |page=19, 22 }}</ref> The next criticizes the feminine dress and hairstyling of young men who it describes as "those Gentlemen who call themselves pretty Fellows". It characterizes their appearance, in which men styled their hair and dressed in a manner similar to their [[footmen]], as history's most preposterous. (In contemporary Britain fears about the consequences of homosexual relationships often centred on their perceived tendency to ignore (and thus weaken) [[Social structure of Britain|class]] boundaries: an effeminate gentleman who dressed like his footman, a servant, embodied this class transgression in a threatening way.<ref>{{Cite book| first=Wayne R. |last=Dynes |title=History of Homosexuality in Europe and America |page=308 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=1992 |isbn=0815305508 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=y8_Ya2s3zN8C&pg=PA308&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22&lr= }}</ref>) The habit of wearing [[makeup]], the pamphlet says, was "as much in Vogue among our Gentlemen, as with the Ladies in ''France''."<ref name="SHH">{{Cite book |title=Satan's Harvest Home|author=Anonymous |year=1749 |city=London }}</ref> Italian opera, too, is criticized for its attributed tendency to feminize men.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Louis |last=Crompton |title=Homosexuality and Civilization |urlhttp://books.google.com/books?id=TfBYd9xVaXcC&pg=PA460&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22&lr=&as_brr=3 |page=460 |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0674022335 }}</ref>

The same chapter describes same-sex kissing, particularly between men, as the most hateful product of [[effeminacy]]. It claims the phenomenon originated in Italy and France, in the latter of which it says even [[nun]]s acted lasciviously together, and decries it as an "Unmanly, Unnatural Usage... the first ''Inlet'' to the detestable Sin of ''Sodomy''".<ref name="SHH"/> The fashion for [[Public display of affection|male public kissing]], the author claims, allowed "[[catamite]]s" to approach men openly in the streets.

Sodomy itself, the pamphlet says, was widespread and becoming more so, and the numerous prosecutions represented likely just a fraction of the total incidences: "We have but too much reason to fear, that there are Numbers yet undiscover'd, and that this abominable Practice gets Ground ev'ry Day."<ref name="Hallam"/><ref name="SHH"/>

===Female homosexual activity===
Same-sex activity between women was also targeted. The pamphlet appears to have plagiarized the "Father Poussin" text to blame [[Sappho]] for devising the "Game of Flats", a "new sort of Sin", which has been interpreted to refer to sexual contact between women (i.e. [[tribadism]],<ref>{{Cite book |first=Judith M. |last=Bennett |title=Singlewomen in the European past, 1250<U+2013>1800 |page=314 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=1998 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=l6YNQ4uUvZ0C&pg=PA314&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22&lr= |isbn=0812216687 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Lewd and notorious |first=Katharine |last=Kittredge |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Gd0bLGsdUhsC&pg=PA29&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22&lr=&as_brr=3 |[age=29 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2003 |isbn=0472089064 }}</ref> a form of "flat" contact, without the presence of protuberant [[male genitalia]]).<ref>{{Cite book |first=Harriette |last=Andreadis |title=Sappho in early modern England |page=10 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2001 |isbn=0226020088 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ihjYvT-KlTMC&pg=PA103&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22 }}</ref> This activity, the book claims, is popular both "in Turkey" and "at [[Twickenham]]".<ref name="SHH"/><ref name="Hitchcock"/>

===Prostitution===
The pamphlet claims the streets of London were astonishingly full of prostitutes, male and female, to the extent that whole districts <U+2013> such as [[Drury Lane]], which purportedly housed 107 brothels in the early 18th century <U+2013> were exclusively inhabited by prostitutes:<ref name="Linnane">{{Cite book |first=Fergus |last=Linnane |title=London: the wicked city |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sqUjV6qktb0C&pg=PA158&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22&lr=&as_brr=3 |publisher=Robson |year=2007 |isbn=1861059906}}</ref>

(Page 25)<ref name="SHH"/>}}

Though the pamphlet describes the pitiable and desperate conditions in which prostitutes lived, and the corruption of the police supposed to be patrol them, it also accuses prostitutes of 'Inhumanity' and deems them devilish and monstrous.<ref name="SHH"/> The vices of the prostitute are presented as those endemic among all women.<ref name="SHH"/><ref name="Carter">{{Cite book |first=Sophie |last=Carter |title=Purchasing Power: representing prostitution in eighteenth-century English popular print culture |page=22 |publisher=Ashgate |year=2004 |isbn=0754606295 }}</ref>

==="Petit Ma<U+00EE>tre"===
The pamphlet concludes with a poem, "Petit Ma<U+00EE>tre", criticizing a man with an effeminate appearance. The style has been characterized as satirical.<ref name="Griffin">{{Cite book |first=Robert John |last=Griffin |title=The faces of anonymity |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vBVYptV6LksC&pg=PA92&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22&lr= |page=92 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2003 |isbn=0312295308 }}</ref> The final verse not only exhorts men to dress in a masculine style, but suggests that the effeminate are in any case less than manly:

{{quote|If thou art a Man, forbear <br> Thus, this motly Garb to wear; <br> Do not Reason thus displace, <br> Do not Man-hood thus disgrace; <br> But thy Sex by Dress impart, <br> And appear like what thou art: <br> Like what thou art, said I, pray pardon me; <br> I mean, appear like what thou ought'st to be.<ref name="SHH"/>}}

==Reception==
Some modern analyses have characterized the pamphlet as a "best-seller" in its own time.<ref>{{Cite book |title=European sexualities, 1400<U+2013>1800 |first=Katherine |last=Crawford |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=K7UdTdHwpgkC&pg=PA213&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22&lr=&as_brr=3 |page=213 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=0521839580 }}</ref> Its familiarity today may also derive from its inclusion in several 19th century bibliographies: it was listed in [[William Thomas Lowndes|W. T. Lowndes]]'s pioneering '' Bibliographer's Manual of English Literature'', published 1834, generally regarded as the first such systematic literary bibliography.<ref>{{Cite book |first=William Thomas |last=Lowndes |title=The bibliographer's manual of English literature |publisher=Henry G.

The ''Index'' reproduced substantial portions of the original text, introducing the work as a "rare volume, its object being strictly moral."<ref name="Ashbee">{{Cite book |title=Index Librorum Prohibitorum: being Notes Bio- Biblio- Icono- graphical and Critical, on Curious and Uncommon Books |place=London |year=1877 |publisher=Private |author=Pisanus Fraxi (Henry Spencer Ashbee |page=357}}</ref>

Modern scholars have attended to the pamphlet as an example of contemporary attitudes toward homophobia, effeminacy, prostitution, and even international relations. David Robinson characterizes the pamphlet's contents as "blatant, vituperative homophobia",<ref>{{Cite book |title=Closeted writing and lesbian and gay literature |first=David M |last=Robinson |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LdXlsCzzPgEC&pg=PA37&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22 |page=88 |publisher=Ashgate |year=2006 |isbn=0754655504 }}</ref> and the ''[[Encyclopedia of Homosexuality]]'' identifies it as an effort to incite anti-homosexual sentiment.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Encyclopedia of homosexuality |editor=Warren Dynes |publisher=Garland |year=1990 |page=255 |isbn=0824065441 }}</ref> Christopher Hobson presents pamphlets of this type as the handmaid of eighteenth-century English judicial crackdowns against homosexual offenders; as a mechanism whereby homosexual behaviour was kept indefensible, and potential perpetrators kept terrified.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Christopher Z. |last=Hobson |title=Blake and homosexuality |page=7 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HIDI3r1O9-oC&pg=PA7&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22&lr= |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2000 |isbn=0312234511 }}</ref> 

Ian McCormick diagnoses the pamphlet as representing a gradual change in European discourse on the character of the [[sodomite]]: previous publications had discussed sexual deviance (conceived in contemporary terms) as a general evil; with ''Satan's Harvest Home'' a new attention was brought to the individual character of persons who committed sodomy.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Ian |last=McCormick |title=Sexual outcasts, 1750<U+2013>1850: Sodomy |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=g8IYlmqglFoC&pg=PA5&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22&lr= |page=5 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2000 |isbn=0415201489 }}</ref> The pamphlet's equation of effeminacy with homosexuality is identified by Michael Kimmel as distinctive for the period.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Michael S. |last=Kimmel |title=The History of Men |page=193 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3DDEbFKCIOEC&pg=RA2-PA193&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22&lr= |publisher=SUNY Press |year=2005 |isbn=0791463400 }}</ref>

Other scholars have identified the text's tone as [[satirical]] and mildly obscene, locating it among a movement of pamphlets influenced by a counter-trend promoting greater sympathy for [[prostitution]].<ref>{{Cite book |first=Bradford Keyes |last=Mudge |title=The Whore's Story |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=d1zzkBw_SmEC&pg=PA267&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22&lr= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0195135059 }}</ref> Linda Dowling interprets the pamphlet less a broadside against sodomites, and more as evidence of a strand in rhetoric that valorized Britain's martial past and saw lack of respect for it as a precondition for vice.<ref name="Dowling">{{Cite book |title=Hellenism and homosexuality in Victorian Oxford |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YFT_7wfus0QC&pg=PA10&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22&lr= |page=10 |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1996 |isbn=0801481708 }}</ref> Ian Bell considers the causality of this relationship between moral collapse and vice, characterizing the book as part of strand that saw vice as a product, not a cause, of a fundamental collapse in morality in [[Augustan literature|Augustan]] London.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Ian A. |last=Bell |title=Literature and crime in Augustan England |publisher=Routledge |year=1991 |isbn=0415022312 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PIU9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA130&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22&lr=}}</ref>

Many scholars have considered the pamphlet as evidence for an association, in eighteenth-century thought, between same-sex vice and the influence of continental (and specifically [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]) European mores, particularly of those from France and Italy. George Haggerty sees the pamphlet as typical of a trend in eighteenth century British discourse that blamed Italy and France for exporting sodomy to Britain;<ref>{{Cite book |first=George E. |last=Haggerty |title=Queer Gothic |page=66 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5R4xFxopXCUC&pg=PA66&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=2006 |isbn=0252073533 }}</ref> Valerie Traub notes its references to "foreign contagion... the criminal amorousness endemic to France and Italy."<ref>{{Cite book |first=Valerie |last=Traub |title=The Renaissance of Lesbianism in Early Modern England |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fxxJeSa9siYC&pg=PA314&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22 |page=315 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=0521448859 }}</ref>.  

George Rousseau, similarly, cites the pamphlet as part of a body of 1740s "sodomy" literature so wide-ranging as to suggest that the term's meaning might have been mutable, broad, and vague. He argues specifically that, in the 1740s, the term had a strong connotation of an imported vice; it was often used in the 1740s to connote suspicion against foreigners.<ref name="Rousseau" /> The pamphlet's text, on page 50, includes the strident claim "Damn'd Fashion! Imported from ''Italy'' amid'st a Train of other ''unnatural Vices''. Have we not ''Sins'' enough of our own, but we must eke 'em out with those of ''Foreign Nations'', to fill up the Cup of our ''Abominations'', and make us yet more ripe for ''Divine Vengeance''?"<ref name="SHH"/> The plausibility of the theory that "sodomy", however understood, was particularly prevalent in Italy is difficult to assess, though Trevor Dean notes that, earlier, seventeenth-century Italy had undergone increasingly vigorous efforts to monitor and regulate sexual activity.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Crime, society and the law in Renaissance Italy |first=Trevor |last=Dean |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=m-eU2tdDxpwC&pg=PA75&dq=%22satan%27s+harvest+home%22&lr=&as_brr=3 |page=75 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=1994 |isbn=0521411025 }}</ref>
