'''The Moonlight Murders''' is a term used by the news media referring to violent crimes committed in and around [[Texarkana]] in the spring of 1946 by a serial killer known as the [[Phantom Killer]] or Phantom Slayer. The killer, who was never apprehended, is credited with attacking eight people, killing five. Contrary to popular belief, the killer did not attack during a full moon but did strike late at night. The murders were reported nationally by the [[Associated Press]], [[International News Service]], ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'',<ref>1946; 2003</ref> the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]], ''[[Dallas Times Herald]]'', ''[[The Denver Post]]'', ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'', ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'', ''[[Life Magazine]]'',<ref>July 10, 1946</ref> ''[[Times-Picayune|New Orleans Times-Picayune]]'', ''[[Shreveport Times]]'', ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'',<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Thursday, May 6, 1971</ref> ''[[Washington Times-Herald]],''<ref>April 15, 1946; ''Texarkana Daily News'', April 15, 1946, page 2</ref> and internationally by ''[[The London Times]]''.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'' special limited edition tabloid ''The Phantom Killer at 50: A Retrospective'', page 16</ref> The 1976 film ''[[The Town That Dreaded Sundown]]''<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Friday, December 24, 1976</ref> is loosely based on the events, despite its claim that "only the names have been changed".

==The attacks and murders==
===Jimmy Hollis/Mary Jeanne Larey===
The Phantom first struck late Friday night around 11:55 p.m. on February 22 and early Saturday morning. His first victims were James B. "Jimmy" Hollis, 24, and his girlfriend, Mary Jeanne Larey, 19, who were parked on a secluded road known as a [[lovers' lane]].<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Sunday, February 24, 1946, front page</ref> The attack happened on a lateral road off of Richmond road, a mile north of the Beverly addition. According to a 14-page statement by Hollis, dated October 15, 2007, the attack happened about 50 feet off Richmond road on an unpaved street, about 100 yards from the last row of city homes.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Tuesday, June 9, 2009, pg. 4A</ref> A 1945 Texarkana City Directory indicates that the residential development of Beverly stopped in about the [http://maps.google.com/maps?rlz=1T4ADFA_enUS367US368&q=600+richmond++Texarkana&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=600+Richmond+Rd,+Texarkana,+TX+75503&gl=us&ei=fQTMS7SNFoaw9QSfl9XLBA&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ8gEwAA 600 block of Richmond road], which means the attack occurred somewhere near [http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&safe=off&rlz=1T4ADFA_enUS367US368&q=500+richmond+Texarkana&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=500+Richmond+Rd,+Texarkana,+TX+75501&gl=us&ei=cQXMS9qwF4LC9QS9r-DMBA&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ8gEwAA Taylor street]; contrary to the belief that it happened near the [http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&safe=off&rlz=1T4ADFA_enUS367US368&q=3603+Robison+Texarkana&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=3603+N+Robison+Rd,+Texarkana,+TX+75503&gl=us&ei=sc7NS_6ZDI_69AT0-Zi9Dw&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CAkQ8gEwAA intersection of Richmond and Robison].

The couple arrived at the scene around 11:45 p.m. After being there about ten minutes, a man walked up to Hollis' driver-side door and flashed a flashlight in the window. Hollis expected to see a policeman, but noticed a man wearing a white hood over his face with holes cut out for the eyes and mouth. The man had a pistol and told him something like "I don't want to kill you fellow, so do what I say"<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Friday, May 10, 1946</ref> and demanded them to get out of the car. They both got out through the driver-side door. The man told Hollis to "take off your [expletive deleted] britches."<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Friday, May 10, 1946</ref> Larey pleaded with Hollis to please take them off, believing that if he did they wouldn't be hurt, but after Hollis removed his trousers he was struck twice in the head with a heavy blunt object. Larey explained in an interview three months later with ''[[Texarkana Gazette]]'' reporter Lucille Holland that the noise was so loud she thought he had been shot, but learned later it was the sound of his skull cracking.

Larey then picked up Hollis' pants and pulled out his wallet and told the assailant "look he doesn't have any money." The assailant told her she was lying and that she had a purse. Larey told him that she didn't and was knocked to the ground. She said she felt like she was hit with an iron pipe. The assailant ordered her to get up, and when she did, he told her to run. As Larey started running towards a ditch, the assailant told her not to go that way but to run up the road. While she was running, she stated she heard Hollis groaning, and that the man continued to beat and stomp him. The assailant then ran after Larey, who was having trouble running from wearing high heels. She saw an older car parked further up the street facing their vehicle. She quickly looked inside to see if anyone was in there who could help her; and after seeing no one inside, she started to run again but was overtaken by the attacker. The man asked her why she was running. She told him he told her to run. Larey stated that "he called me a liar again and then I knew that he was going to kill me." He knocked her down and preceded to assault her sexually. Larey stated he did not rape her, but abused her terribly. Later reports indicated the assailant sexually assaulted her with the barrel of his gun.

She managed to get up and told the assailant to "go ahead and kill me." She ran half a mile, believing she was still being chased, to a Beverly residence at [http://maps.google.com/maps?rlz=1T4ADFA_enUS367US368&q=805+blanton++Texarkana&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=805+Blanton+St,+Texarkana,+TX+75501&gl=us&ei=rgXMS8q2IYfw9gTe6LnUBA&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ8gEwAA 805 Blanton street]<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Tuesday, June 9, 2009, pg. 4A</ref> where she screamed for help and banged on the front door. A car passed, but did not stop when she called after it. She ran to the back of the house and woke up the owners who then notified the authorities. [[Bowie County]] Sheriff W. H. "Bill" Presley and three other officers arrived at the scene, but the attacker had already driven off. They found Hollis' pants 100 yards away from the attack.

====Post attack====
Larey was taken to the hospital for minor cuts and received stitches for head wounds while Hollis was hospitalized for several days with three skull fractures.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Tuesday, June 9, 2009, pg. 4A</ref> Larey was taken home that evening by Sheriff's Deputies. She stated she didn't know why the attacker did not chase after her or kill her. She later learned that the injured Hollis made his way to Richmond road and flagged down a passing motorist who contacted a local funeral home ambulance. Larey stated that she thought the attacker may have been scared off by headlights. She told Lucille Holland in their interview that she told the attacker to kill her because she would rather have been dead than to be touched or abused. She also explained that she didn't understand why officers did not believe her when she told them on the night of the attack that the attacker was black and that she didn't know who he was. She said that officers attempted to coerce her into stating she knew the assailant.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Friday, May 10, 1946, front page</ref> Hollis and Larey described him as a man with a white mask over his head, with cutout places for his eyes and mouth. Although Jimmy believed he was a dark-tanned white man, Mary believed he was a light-skinned [[Negro]] "because of the way he pronounced the curse words he growled."<ref>''The Kansas City Star'', Sunday, June 2, 1946</ref> They agree he was about six feet tall.

The details of the attack were published in the ''Texarkana Daily News'', a now-defunct evening newspaper, on Saturday, February 23, 1946, on the front page with the headline "Masked Man Beats Texarkanian and Girl". By March 9, no developments had been made but the department continued to search for clues to the identity of the attacker.<ref>''Texarkana Daily News'', Saturday, March 9, 1946, front page</ref> The case was considered as an isolated incident and further attacks were not expected. The next attack would not take place until a month later on March 24.

Mary soon moved to [[Frederick, Oklahoma]] to live with her aunt and uncle. After the first double murder, she made a trip from Frederick to Texarkana hoping that her story would help police connect the incidents and catch the killer. She was questioned by the [[Texas Rangers Division|Texas Rangers]] who continued to insist that she knew who her attacker was. Later, after the second double murder, Texas Ranger Joe Thompson flew to Frederick to question her again.

It wouldn't be until after the murder of Starks that this attack was considered as a connection. After the murder of Virgil Starks, Hollis and Larey declared their attacker was the same phantom gunman that killed five people.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Saturday, May 11, 1946, front page</ref> Hollis said "I think the man is a young white man; under thirty years old." He also stated "I know he's crazy. The crazy things he said made me feel that his mind was warped," and "Evidently he thought he had killed me that night. Right after it happened, I told the deputy sheriff and the city attorney that that man was dangerous. He is a potential murderer. The next person he gets will be killed. It wasn't long after that when the first two bodies were found out on West Seventh street. I think there are three people alive today who escaped from that man. The woman who is in the hospital now [Katy Starks], Miss Larey and I."

====Flight to Frederick====
Almost a week after the murder of Virgil Starks, and before the attack on Hollis and Larey was officially connected to the double murders, ''Texarkana Gazette'' editor J.Q. Mahaffey called a pilot named Paul Burns to request a favor. "He asked me if I could fly one of his reporters, Lucille Holland, to Frederick, Oklahoma to interview one of the first victims of the Phantom Killer, Mary Jeanne Larey," Burns revealed to the ''Gazette''. He continued, "I told J.Q. to get her to the airport quickly so we could make the flight before dark. The aircraft, a [[Luscombe 8|Luscombe Silvaire]], was not certified to fly after sundown because it had no lights on it. We took off and headed west up the Red River toward Frederick, which is northwest of [[Wichita Falls]]. I began to run into a strong head wind and soon realized I would have to refuel along the route." Burns did not refuel because the wind was so strong he feared maintaining control of the plane would be too dangerous. "Bucking a strong head wind and getting low on fuel, I had to land at Ardmore Airport. I managed to land on the grass beside a hanger, refueled and soon we were in the air again." Darkness was not far off but, "Lucille wanted very much to get there and keep her appointment with the Phantom's victim. So we continued on," Burns stated. The airport in Frederick was a cow pasture with a couple of hangers. "With no lights to guide us, I buzzed over Frederick a couple of times in the dark, in hopes of attracting the airport manager's attention. He heard us and came out to the airport."<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'' special limited edition tabloid ''The Phantom Killer at 50: A Retrospective'', page 20</ref>

Lucille Holland got her interview with Miss Larey that night. Miss Larey revealed to her details of the attack and the attacker. She also stated that the police and Texas Rangers did not believe she didn't know the attacker and even tried to coerce her into telling them who he was. The interview was published the next morning in the ''Texarkana Gazette'' on the front page on May 10, 1946.

===Richard L. Griffin/Polly Ann Moore===
Richard L. Griffin, 29, and his girlfriend of six weeks, Polly Ann Moore, 17, were found dead in Richard's 1941 [[Oldsmobile]] sedan on Sunday morning, March 24, 1946 between 8:30 and 9:00 by a passing motorist.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Monday, March 25, 1946, front page</ref><ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Sunday, May 2, 1971, pg. 2A</ref> The motorist saw the parked car on a lovers' lane named Rich road (now South Robison) near a [[branch line|railroad spur]] 100 yards south of US Highway 67 West close to a nightspot called Club Dallas.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Tuesday, June 9, 2009, pg. 4A</ref> At that time, it was about a mile west outside of the city limits. The motorist at first thought they were asleep. Griffin was found between the front seats on his knees with his head resting on his crossed hands and his pockets were turned inside out. Miss Moore was found sprawled face-down in the back seat. Griffin had been shot twice while still in the car<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'' special limited edition tabloid ''The Phantom Killer at 50: A Retrospective''</ref> and both had been shot once in the back of the head and were fully clothed. Polly's purse was beside her in the back seat and contained the photo of her that was used in the following morning's paper. The motorist contacted the city police who then contacted Bowie County Sheriff W. H. Presley. According to a police report written by Arkansas State Trooper Max Tackett, one of the lead investigators of the Phantom cases, Moore was killed on a blanket in front of the vehicle before being placed back inside.

In a mix-up, Moore's body was picked up before an examination could determine if she had been sexually assaulted. Both bodies were taken to the Texarkana Funeral Home. The couple were last seen having dinner with Griffin's sister and her boyfriend around 10 p.m. Saturday night in a cafe on West Seventh street, also known as US Highway 67 West. They were also seen earlier Saturday at 2 p.m. by friends in another West Seventh street cafe. On Monday, March 25, the front page of the morning paper read "Couple Found Shot to Death in Auto".

====The investigation====
Bowie County Sheriff W. H. Presley, leader of the investigation, was with his old friend Texas City Police Chief Jack N. Runnels when the call came in and they sped to the scene. They immediately launched a city-wide investigation along with the Texas and Arkansas city police, the [[Department of Public Safety]], [[Miller County, Arkansas|Miller]] and [[Cass County, Texas|Cass County]] sheriffs' departments and the [[FBI]]. No money was found on Griffin nor was any found in Moore's purse. Family members claimed that they did not carry much money with them.<ref>''Texarkana Daily News'', Monday, March 25, 1946, front page</ref> By Monday morning the Texas Rangers were called in.

Polly Ann was identified when Sheriff Presley called Homer Carter, the city marshal of [[Atlanta, Texas]], for the initials P.A.M. which were found on her 1945 Atlanta High School class ring. Officials spent most of Sunday exploiting the very few clues that were left behind. Presley declared that no break in the case was left in sight. Among the uncovered clues were a section of ground 20 feet from the car saturated in dry blood, blood spotted throughout the vehicle, and congealed blood on the running board which flowed through the bottom of the door. A blanket was also found in the car and a .32 cartridge shell, believed to be shot from a [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]], inside the blanket.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Sunday, May 2, 1971, page 2</ref> No gun was found at the scene, which ruled out a murder-suicide; and since it had rained overnight it was believed that any footprints left by the killer were washed away.

Texas Ranger Jimmy Greer arrived in Texarkana Monday night around 9 p.m. He and the rest of the investigators combed for more clues on Tuesday. They concluded the only apparent motive was robbery. The investigators continued to work overtime on the crime the papers called "baffling". The lack of definite clues hampered their investigation. The bloody sand which was found seven steps in front of the car was sent to laboratories of the State Department of Public Safety in [[Austin, Texas]] along with the blood-soaked clothing of the victims to be determined if the blood belonged to one of the victims or a third party.<ref>''Texarkana Daily News'', Wednesday, March 27, 1946, front page</ref> They continued their investigations as they waited for the blood test results.

By Thursday, March 28, the investigators were growing weary after five consecutive days of questioning suspects, which by that time was around 200 people, chasing over a hundred false leads and tips and going back over the meager clues. They managed to get three suspects in custody because of bloody clothing, two of which were released on explanations that satisfied the officers. The third suspect was being held in [[Vernon, Texas]] for further grilling. Dick Oldhan, another Ranger, was called in and arrived Wednesday from [[Tyler, Texas]] to help in the investigation.

In the March 27 edition of ''Texarkana Gazette'' an announcement was made that told readers You Can Help Solve Murders:
<blockquote>Sheriff Bill Presley and his deputies have a difficult task ahead of them as they attempt to solve the shocking double murder discovered Sunday morning. Texarkana residents can help in this investigation and at the same time if they are not careful, they can hinder the investigation and cause the officers to spend many hours following blind trails. Persons who have information which might furnish a clue to the identity of the slayer or slayers or which might indicate a motive for the crime should not divulge such information on street corners or at cold drink stands but should immediately make it available to the officers. Do not spread rumors regardless of how much basis for fact there is in them. Do not say 'I heard' or 'they say', because the chances are that the person listening will repeat your information and enlarge upon it. Before long the story grows to such proportions as to necessitate a detailed investigation by the officers, thereby perhaps pulling them off the true trail and sending them up a blind alley. Stick to facts that you know of your own personal knowledge and relay those facts as quickly as possible to the officers.</blockquote>

By Saturday, March 30, Sheriff Presley and [[Chief of Police]] Jack N. Runnels posted a $500 reward in an effort to gain any new information on the Griffin and Moore case that would lead to the arrest and conviction of the slayer or slayers. Officers stated that all leads and clues found thus far in the mystery shooting was fruitless. The results from the blood-stained sand was expected to arrive the day before, but due to delays at the laboratory, the results had not come in. By April 11, the officers were all still hard at work on the double murder case. Presley said that his department and other law authorities had not relaxed for one minute since the discovery of the crime. He also stated that the $500 reward was still being offered and that no tip, no matter how small, was left without a thorough investigation.

===Paul Martin/Betty Jo Booker===
On Saturday night, April 13, Betty Jo Booker, 15, was playing her Bundy E-flat [[alto saxophone]] in her regular weekly gig with her band, The Rythmaires, at the [[VFW|VFW Club]] on [http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&safe=off&rlz=1T4ADFA_enUS367US368&q=400+oak+st+Texarkana&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=400+Oak+St,+Texarkana,+TX+75501&gl=us&ei=2wHMS4L9Jo3w9ASi5J3FBA&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ8gEwAA W. 4th and Oak street]. It was not a place for kids because of beer, but rules were agreed upon by Betty's parents and the band leader, Jerry Atkins. She did not finish until around 1:30 a.m. Sunday. She waited for her friend-since-kindergarten, Paul Martin, 16, to pick her up. Paul was in from town after moving away to [[Kilgore, Texas|Kilgore]] two years prior. Paul had hung out with her earlier that day before the dance and was to pick her up and take her to a slumber party across town. Betty's classmates said that earlier that day she told them that she didn't want to go out with Paul but felt obligated since he was an old friend.

Betty Jo and Paul were killed early Sunday, April 14. Paul's body was found at about 6:30 a.m. by Mr. and Mrs. G. H. Weaver and their son who were headed to [[Prescott, Arkansas|Prescott]]. They drove 200 yards to the nearest residence of Mr. and Mrs. Harvey Word to notify them and contact the police. Paul's body was found lying on its left side by the northern side of North Park road. Blood was found further down on the other side of the road by a fence. According to an old rough-drawn map of the discoveries, the body was found somewhere near the [http://maps.google.com/maps?rlz=1T4ADFA_enUS367US368&q=6700+N+Park+Texarkana&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=6700+N+Park+Rd,+Texarkana,+TX+75503&gl=us&ei=AAbMS4nTEZH88wSX2PHOBA&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ8gEwAA 6700 block of North Park road] today. Paul was shot four times. One through the nose, left of the nasal arch, a second through the left fourth rib from behind, a third in the right hand and the fourth bullet entered the back of the neck and exited the front right part of his head to the right of the middle line level of the upper portion of the ear.<ref>''Corroborating Evidence II'', pg. 129''</ref>

Betty Jo's body wasn't found until approximately 11:30 a.m., almost two miles away from Martin's body. The body was found by Jack Boyd and his brother Jim Boyd, his father James, and his uncles Seth and George Boyd along with their friend Ted Schoeppey who had joined in a search party because they were friends of the girl's family. Jack, along with his dad and uncles, were members of the Men's Bible Class as well as Sheriff W. H. Presley at First United Methodist Church on Fourth and State Line Avenue. Sheriff Presley came into Sunday School that morning and asked the group to help search for Betty Jo because her friend's body had been found but hers had not. George Boyd spotted the body behind a tree 25 yards off the north side of Morris Lane (now Moores Lane) about 200 yards off Summerhill road (near Fernwood Drive today) saying a number of times "Oh my God, there she is!"<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'' special limited edition tabloid ''The Phantom Killer at 50: A Retrospective'', page 22</ref>

The body was lying on its back, fully clothed with a buttoned overcoat and her right hand was in the pocket. Betty was shot twice, once through the left fifth rib from the front and once in the face through the left cheek by the nose. The weapon used was the same as that of the first double murder, a [[.32 ACP|.32 automatic Colt pistol]]. The reports in the following day's newspaper claimed that the bodies were not abused, but later reports claimed that Betty was raped. Paul's 1946 Ford club [[coupe]]<ref>''Texarkana Daily News'', Wednesday, April 17, 1946, page 2</ref> was found about three miles away from her body<ref>http://www.txkphantom.site11.com/wanted.html</ref> and 1.55 miles away from his body on the west side of the road. It was parked [http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&safe=off&rlz=1T4ADFA_enUS367US368&q=4897+N+Park+Texarkana&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=4897+N+Park+Rd,+Texarkana,+TX+75503&gl=us&ei=ZwPMS9WsEo-U8QT5-vncBA&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ8gEwAA 400 yards (1,200 ft./.22 miles) from the park's main entrance] across where the Spring Lake School used to be with the keys still in it. The authorities were not sure who was shot first. Sheriff Presley along with Texas Ranger Captain [[Manuel T. Gonzaullas|Manuel Trazazas "Lone Wolf" Gonzaullas]] said that examinations of the bodies indicated that they both had put up a terrific struggle.<ref>''Texarkana Daily News'', Monday, April 15, 1946, front page</ref>

====News====
Jerry Atkins, Betty's band leader who was a senior, had an arrangement with Betty's parents to take her to and from the dances. He and another band member, Ernie Holcomb, would take turns giving her and other band members rides. It was Ernie's turn that night but was told by Betty that she had a ride with an old friend. Jerry was woken up the next morning at 6:00 with a telephone call. It was a female asking if he knew where Betty Jo was. Jerry told her that Ernie took her home, but the girl said she was supposed to go to a party but never came. Jerry had no knowledge of her arrangements. He went to sleep and was awakened by another call around 8:00. The new female caller asked the same questions. Jerry started asking her if she had checked with Betty's parents. The girl told Jerry that she was picked up by an old friend named Paul and that they were both supposed to come to a party but never showed up.

A news bulletin came over the radio stating that a young male teen was found shot to death at Spring Lake Park. Jerry's friend, Sonny, who had stayed the night with him, knew that Betty wasn't going straight home and was being picked up by Paul, but forgot to inform him. Jerry was surprised by this because he never heard of Paul. As they continued to listen to the developments, Jerry tried contacting Ernie, but to no avail. He tried visiting his house just three blocks away, but no one was home. He didn't confirm that Betty was not taken home by Ernie until three hours later. Ernie had gone out-of-town with his parents to visit his sister in [[Vivian, Louisiana]], returning later Sunday night; something Jerry learned the next day. News over the radio had been spreading that morning since the first discovery. Hundreds of people flocked to the area. Throughout the day, cars jammed the highway and roads in the park from people trying to view the crime scenes. Jerry wanted to go to the park but was shocked by the news, and the radio was discouraging more people from going there. Several hundred residents assembled around the sheriff's office to be on the spot in case a suspect was apprehended.

Jerry found out about Betty's body being discovered when the radio stated it around noon. Jerry stayed in contact with two other female band members and they heard that the Texas Rangers were to be in Texarkana by the evening and that they were going to talk to anybody who might have information. Jerry knew that he and a few others were the last ones to see her alive. He knew that Betty should have her saxophone and that it would be a good lead if no saxophone was found. He wondered if the law knew there was a saxophone involved, so he called and went to the Bowie County Sheriff's Office around 9:00 that night. He and a few classmates talked to Sheriff Bill Presley and head of investigation Texas Ranger Captain M. T. "Lone Wolf" Gonzaullas for a long time. No saxophone was found and they all came to the conclusion that it was a very important lead. The news was printed in the next morning's paper on April 15, on the front page, reading: "TEEN-AGE COUPLE SHOT TO DEATH".

====The aftermath====
=====The investigation=====
Like the first double murder, Sheriff Presley and his long-time friend Chief of Police Jack N. Runnels were the first officers on the scene. Sheriff Presley said that this crime coincided in many details of the first double murder. After collecting all of the evidence they could find, they called in virtually every law enforcement agency in the city, county, state and federal governments; various county and city officers from Bowie, Miller, [[Little River County, Arkansas|Little River]] and Cass counties, as well as the Texas and Arkansas state police, Texas Rangers, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. M. T. "Lone Wolf" Gonzaullas, the captain of the Company B Texas Rangers from [[Dallas, Texas]], as well as six other Texas Rangers (Stewart Stanley, Jim Geer, Dick Oldham, Earnest Daniel, N. K. Dixon, Tulley E. Seay) came to Texarkana to help in the investigation.

Suspects were consistently brought in throughout the day by city police. About 500 people gathered around the sheriff's office to be on the spot if the killer was apprehended. Many friends, schoolmates and others went to the Bowie County Sheriff's Office to lend any helpful information. Among those were Jerry Atkins and other girls from Booker's band. Jerry and the other girls talked to Captain Gonzaullas and Sheriff Presley for a long time. He helped by suggesting Betty Jo should have had her saxophone with her and since no saxophone was found, it became a very important lead. The make and serial number (#52535) were obtained and was widely circulated to pawn shops and music dealers in many states, but her saxophone would not be found until six months later. Suspects were continually questioned during the night, but by Monday morning, Gonzaullas said that although some progress had been made there were still many missing links.

By the end of Monday night, a $600 reward was offered to anyone with "solution-breaking information". $500 from Presley and Runnels for the Griffin/Moore case and $100 from Oliver Dreyer, whose house was near where Martin's body was found, for either double murder cases. Dreyer said that if the reward were paid in one of the cases, a similar amount would be paid for the other. A committee to handle the reward fund was composed, with a chairman named John Holman. The following denominations were accepted: $25, $50, $100, $250, or $500. By Tuesday morning, the reward total reached $2,200.<ref>''Texarkana Daily News'', Tuesday, April 16, 1946, front page</ref>

Although the investigators had in the past cracked some of the most publicized and difficult cases in Texas, Captain Gonzaullas said that the murders was one of the most puzzling cases he had encountered in his 30 years of criminal investigation. He also stated that "We have certain information which we cannot disclose and we do not think the public should expect us to give out any information which would be injurious to our investigation." The ''Texarkana Gazette'' and ''Daily News'' cooperated with Captain Gonzaullas by withholding certain information which would have been detrimental to the investigation. Sheriff Presley and the Rangers stated that out of the many suspects questioned during that past two days and nights of ceaseless work, very little valuable information had been obtained. Presley stated, "We are required to follow all leads, regardless of how thin they might be, in the hope that they will lead to something tangible in the eventual solution of the mystery." The officers started to work in relays on Tuesday after many of them had become exhausted in their investigations.<ref>''Texarkana Daily News'', Tuesday, April 16, 1946, page 2</ref> Gonzaullas stated that they were dealing with a shrewd criminal who had left no stones unturned in concealing his identity and activities. A voluntary midnight curfew was agreed upon Tuesday night by the Texarkana, Texas city council and the Bowie county commissioners court for all places of amusement.

By Wednesday, newspaper crews camped outside the door of the "questioning room". Reporters from the ''Dallas Morning News'' and ''Fort Worth Star Telegram'' had showed up. Captain Gonzaullas guarded new developments from being known, especially from the press. He dodged questions from reporters for 30 minutes but assured them that progress was being made. Three rooms in the Bowie County building were being utilized for questioning suspects from a 100-mile radius, both men and women, black and white. By April 24, no new developments had been made, but the Texas Rangers assured the town that they would remain in the city and stay on the case until the killer or killers were apprehended for both double murders. The Rangers had an airplane brought in to help facilitate their investigation for chasing leads and interrogating suspects out of town.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Thursday, April 25, front page</ref> By Thursday, April 25, the reward fund was raised to $6,425 from many various contributors.

=====Rumors=====
By the following Tuesday night after the second double murder, rumors had already snowballed that the killer had been caught. Captain Gonzaullas and Sheriff Presley discounted them. By Wednesday, the following day, rumors had spread that a local minister had turned in his own son as a suspect to the killing of Paul Martin and Betty Jo Booker.<ref>''Texarkana Daily News'', Wednesday, April 17, 1946, front page</ref> Captain Gonzaullas said that the rumor was unfounded and that he was surprised at the credence locals had given it. He also stated that "The spreading of the rumor about a local minister turning in his son as a suspect has hindered the investigation because of the time it was necessary to consume tracking it down. The spreading of the rumor certainly was an injustice to the family and the boy, because it absolutely is not so. We do not have any minister's son in custody at this time, nor have we had one in custody or questioned a minister's son relative to this crime."

As rumors continued, they were being tracked and checked by the investigating officers to make sure that a clue wasn't being overlooked. Stories ranged from the killer turning himself in to a third and even fourth double murder. Gonzaullas stated that Texarkanians were trying hard to help in the cases, but many of them were hindering it maliciously. He said that in too many instances the cases were being used as an instrument for grudges and spitefulness. "Things of that kind do the investigation no good. Rumors are vicious things and great injustice can be done by too much loose talk," said Gonzaullas. On Thursday, Gonzaullas and Presley issued a statement that if and when a break in the cases come, they will have it publicized in the ''Gazette'' and ''Daily News''. Gonzaullas stated that "The newspapers are not printing rumors and have assured us they will not. Any information which the public hears about this case will not be official unless it comes from us through the newspapers. We will continue to work day and night on the investigation. We will appreciate information from citizens and all such information will be treated confidentially."

====Missing saxophone====
On the morning of October 24, two fence repairers, P. V. Ward and J. F. McNief, discovered the missing saxophone still in its black leather case in the vicinity of where Betty Jo was found while they were working on a barbed-wire fence.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Friday, October 25, 1946, front page</ref> It was found ten steps off the opposite side of the lane and about 140 steps east from where the body was found. It was thrown over the barbed-wire fence into some underbrush bordering the south side of Morris (now Moores) Lane, opposite from the side the body was found. At the time of the discovery, the Phantom case was already considered as closed.

Ward, who first saw it, said, "It looked more like an old broken-down suitcase. As soon as I got to it and got a good look, I knew exactly what it was. I told Mack (McNief) to go and call the law." Mack called the police from Ochsenbein's Grocery Store. The case was investigated by Chief of Police Jack N. Runnels, as well as [[Deputy Sheriff]] Z. C. Henslee and officers Pete Carrara and Bill Bagwell. The music case was placed in a paste board box and returned to Chief Runnel's office. The saxophone was tarnished and the leather case's bottom was deteriorated as well as the blue plush lining. It was so decayed that pieces fell to the ground as it was being placed in the box.

Five hours after it was found, Betty's stepfather, Clark Brown, identified the case and instrument as belonging to Betty Jo. In it was a white and orange emblem symbolizing Texas High School as well as bits of music. "[[Anchors Aweigh|The Song of the Navy]]" was in a protected plastic folder which was probably played at the dance on the night of her death.

===Virgil and Katy Starks===
On Friday, May 3, sometime before 9 p.m., Mr. Starks, a farmer and welder, was at his modest, yet modern ranch-style home on his 500-acre farmland off of Highway 67 East, almost 10 miles northeast of Texarkana.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Saturday, May 4, 1946, page 2</ref> He turned on his favorite weekly radio show and his wife gave him a heating pad for his sore back. He sat in his armchair in the sitting room which was just off of the kitchen and the bedroom. While Mrs. Starks was in her bedroom laying on the bed in her nightgown, she heard something from the backyard and asked her husband to turn down the radio. Seconds later while Virgil was reading the May 3 edition of the ''Texarkana Gazette'', two shots were pumped into the back of his head from a closed double-window three feet away which faced the highway. Mrs. Starks didn't hear the gunshot; instead she heard what "sounded like the breaking of glass". She thought Virgil dropped something and went to go see what happened. As she entered the doorway to the living room, she saw Virgil standing up and then suddenly slump back into his chair.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Sunday, May 5, 1946, front page</ref> She saw blood, then ran over to him and lifted up his head. When she realised he was dead, she ran to the phone to call police.

She rang the wall-crank phone two times before being shot twice in the face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. <ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Sunday, May 5, 1946, front page</ref> The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, breaking it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees and crawled into the bedroom where she decided to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran around the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. Mrs. Starks ran from the bedroom and into the kitchen where she heard the killer coming through the kitchen window. She ran back into the bedroom, down a passageway, through another bedroom and then into the living room and out the front door; leaving behind a "virtual river of blood" and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her nightgown, which is now soaked in her blood, she ran across the street to her sister's and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50 yards more to her neighbor, A. V. Prater's house. Mr. Prater answered her call for help. He shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Mr. Prater called to Mr. Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Mr. Taylor along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal, to the dismay of doctors. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed the next morning on Saturday May 4 on the front page reading: "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED."

====The investigation and post-events====
The Miller County sheriff's department was notified just minutes after the alarm reached [[Hope, Arkansas|Hope]] city police. Arkansas state police officers Charley Boyd and Max Tackett got the call on their radio and were the first officers to arrive at the scene. Reports that come next contradict each other. One of the officers said that they found Starks still slumped in the blood-soaked chair. The chair had caught fire from the electric hot pad. "Smoke was filling the room and was coming up all around the man and between his legs."<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Sunday, May 5, 1946, front page</ref> Yet Sheriff W. E. Davis, head of the investigation, said that when officers arrived at the scene, they found the chair on fire but Starks' body wasn't burned because it had fallen on the floor.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Saturday, May 4, 1946, page 2</ref>

Immediately after reports of the slaying spread, blockades were put up several miles northeast and southwest on Highway 67 West. Sheriff Davis called in officers from the entire area to help in the investigation; some of which included two agents from the FBI, Captain Gonzaullas and other Rangers, Sheriff Presley and his deputies, Sheriff Jim Sanderson from Little River county, Arkansas State Police, local police and many others. In the house, investigators found a trail of blood with scattered teeth. On the dining room table was Mrs. Starks' work for making a dress. Gonzaullas, after seeing the "virtual river of blood", stated that "It is beyond me why she did not bleed to death." There were only two bullet holes in the window, leading Sheriff Davis to believe an automatic rifle was used. Investigators declared that after the killer shot Virgil, he waited patiently outside the window to shoot the wife.

Three clues were found at the scene. The first was that of the caliber of bullets. The second being a flashlight which was found in the hedge underneath the window that Starks was shot from. The last clue was of bloody footprints on the kitchen floor. Sheriff Davis stated that although this murder couldn't be directly linked to the Phantom because the caliber was a .22, "it is possible that the killer is one and the same man." Those who had been driving in the area near the time of the slaying, along with several men found within the vicinity, were picked up for questioning. Early Saturday morning, bloodhounds were brought in from Hope by the Arkansas state police. They found two trails that led to the highway before the scent was lost. That night, many officers patrolled lovers' lanes hoping to prevent another attack. By Sunday night, more state police officers were called in to help in the investigation and to aid in protecting the local civilians. Officers had detained at least 12 suspects but only kept three for further questioning. Forty-seven officers were working around the clock to solve the mysteries. Among them were sheriffs of four counties, Captain Gonzaullas and his staff of Texas Rangers, and Chief Deputy Tillman Johnson. The flashlight that was found at the scene was sent off to [[Washington, D.C.]] for further inspection by the FBI. Meanwhile, Mrs. Starks was showing improvements at Michael Meagher Hospital. The unofficial theory for a motive amongst the majority of the 47 officers was that of "sex mania", because large amounts of money in the home was not bothered, nor was Mrs. Starks' purse which was lying on the bed containing money and jewels, and because nothing was taken from the home. The title on the front page of the ''Texarkana Gazette'' on Sunday, May 5, 1946 read: SEX MANIAC HUNTED IN MURDERS.

On the following Tuesday, a mobile radio station was being sent from Austin, Texas. Gonzaullas stated that the unit, which was "one of the best in the country," would be accompanied by a fleet of prowl cars equipped with three-way radio equipment, which would allow the officers to converse not only with headquarters but between cars as well. A clerk from the Bowie county [[Selective Service System|selective service]] Board No. 1 stated that even though he indicated to officers two weeks prior, no investigating officers had checked his files. Another clerk, from the Miller county [[draft board]], also stated that no request for examination of her files have been made. Both explained that their reports would reveal information such as thumb prints, awards such as expert rifleman, and mental and physical conditions of the registrants. That night, during a radio-interview, Gonzaullas asked residents to help the investigation by refraining from spreading and repeating rumors. He stated that "These only take the officers from the main route of the investigation. It is so important that we capture this man that we cannot afford to overlook any lead, no matter how fantastic it may seem."

On the following Wednesday, the mobile radio transmitting station arrived in Texarkana late in the afternoon, along with 10 police cars and 20 state police officers. Captain Gonzaullas placed it into operation immediately. A correspondent from the International News Service made reservations to come to the city and cover the story. Bob Carpenter from the Mutual Broadcasting Service from [[New York City, New York|New York City]] arrived and was arranging a coast-to-coast broadcast directly from the KCMC studios (the ''Gazette'' and ''Daily News'' radio station) on 315 national stations.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Thursday, May 9, 1946, front page</ref>

On Wednesday, May 29, a colored picture on the front page of the ''Texarkana Gazette'' showed the flashlight that was found at Starks' home. It was the ''Texarkana Gazette'''s first colored photograph. The description under the picture read: <blockquote>HAVE YOU SEEN THIS TWO-CELL FLASHLIGHT?--This is a picture in detail of the flashlight found at the scene of the Starks murder. This is a two-cell, all metal flashlight, both ends of which are painted red. Three rivets hold the head of the flashlight to the body of the light. There has been only a limited number of these lights sold in this area. If you have owned or know of any one who owned one of these lights, report at once to Sheriff W. E. Davis, Miller county courthouse, Texarkana, Ark. You may be the one to aid in solving the phantom slayings.</blockquote>

Over a month later on Monday, June 10, Virgil Starks' father, Jack Starks, added a $500 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of his son's killer.

==Consternation & Panic==
Although the first double murder caused some parents to warn their children about being out late, and the second double murder shocked the city and suggested curfews for businesses, the height of the town's hysteria snowballed after the murder of Virgil Starks. The ''Texarkana Gazette'' stated on Sunday, May 5, that the killer might strike again at any moment, at any place and at any one. While it was normal to leave your house unlocked, residents started locking their doors, pulling down shades, blocking windows, and arming themselves with guns. During the next day after Mr. Starks' death, many residents bought firearms and locks. That night and continuing up to Monday, Texarkana residents kept police officers busy by flooding the station with reports of prowlers. An officer stated that nearly ''all'' of the alarms were the result of excitement, wild imagination and even near hysteria.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Monday, May 6, 1946, front page</ref> Farmhouses and neighborhoods were blazing with lights. Businesses on that weekend lost many customers. One business reported a 20% drop off. While the evenings were hopping, by night the streets were practically deserted. The city became a virtual ghost town. Because of the drop in business, liquor stores started closing at 9:30. On the front page of the ''Texarkana Gazette'' on Monday, May 6, a headline stated that the entire area was fighting jitters.

Captain Gonzaullas helped fuel the hysteria when he announced on the radio Tuesday evening that Texarkanians should "Oil up their guns and see if they are loaded. Put them out of the reach of children. Do not use them unless it's necessary, but if you believe it is, do not hesitate." When asked what advice he could give to quiet the town's fear, he responded "I'd tell them to check the locks and bolts on their doors and get a double-barreled shotgun to take care of any intruder who tried to get in." During that Tuesday night, many residents around East Ninth street were alarmed and called into the ''Gazette'' and ''News'' that they believed more murders had been committed because they heard sirens. The sirens turned out to be sound effects from a carnival.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Wednesday, May 8, 1946, front page</ref> Want ads for guard dogs started popping up while others put out ads for selling their own watch dogs.

On Thursday, May 9, the ''Two States Press'', a weekly paper published on Thursdays, announced:
<blockquote>Texarkana people are jittery, plain frightened--and with reason. Within a period of six weeks five people have been murdered in cold blood and a sixth seriously wounded, escaping death by a seeming miracle. The question in the minds of most of the citizens is, when, where and how soon will another tragedy shock the community, and who will be the victim or victims, since two deaths seem to be the design of the killer?</blockquote>

Over a week after the death of Mr. Starks, police departments on both sides of the city were still being swamped with excited calls about prowlers and gunshots. Reports arranged from the possible to the ridiculous, yet officers still diligently checked every report. On Friday, May 10, officers rushed to a home on Olive street with reports of strange noises coming from an upstairs room. Officers found a cat thrashing about in a trash can.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Sunday, May 12, 1946, front page</ref> Again on Olive street, officers checked a report that a strange man was on someone's porch. It turned out that he had stepped out of the rain to wait for a bus. On Magnolia street, a report of a prowler bumping up against a house turned out to be hedges being blown against it. On Sixteenth street, a family called in that they heard a tapping at their door. It was later discovered that a messenger was delivering a special letter. The heard gunshots turned out to be someone shooting at something they thought was a prowler, accidental discharges from people loading their guns, and even backfires from vehicles.

As news announcements spread and suspects searched in surrounding counties, the fear crossed over to many other cities, including [[Hope, Arkansas|Hope]], [[Lufkin, Texas|Lufkin]] and [[Magnolia, Arkansas|Magnolia]], even going as far as [[Oklahoma City]].

==The victims==
===Jimmy Hollis===
Jimmy Hollis was a 24 year-old insurance agent at the time of the attack. He lived at 3502 N. [[State Line Avenue]]; a house which no longer exists. On the night of his attack, he was at the movies on a double date with his brother, Bob, who was also an insurance agent. After the movie, he dropped his brother and his date off. As he and Mary were headed to her house, they stopped on a lateral road off of Richmond where the attack occurred. Jimmy suffered three fractures in his skull and was hospitalized for several days at Texarkana Hospital (also known as Pine street Hospital) which stood at W. 5th and Pine street and no longer exists. He was in very serious critical condition. After four days, he was showing slight improvement but was still not fully conscious.<ref>''Texarkana Daily News'', Tuesday, February 26, 1946</ref> He was released from the hospital on Saturday, March 9. His doctor told him it would be "some time" before he is completely well again and that he was not to work for six months. By the middle of May, he was still recovering from his injuries. Three months after the attack, he stated "I still get nervous when I think about it. At night, on the street, even downtown." Starting at the end of April, he spent a week with Mary in Frederick, Oklahoma before residing in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] where he considered to take a job as an [[accountant]] and [[bookkeeper]].

===Mary Jeanne Larey===
Mary, a brunette, was 19 when she was attacked and lived at East Hooks courts, near to where the attack happened. She had just been on a double date at the movies with Jimmy's brother and his girlfriend. On the way home, Bob and his date didn't want to ride all the way to Mary's house, so they were dropped off. Jimmy and Mary then headed to the lovers' lane just off of Richmond, where the attack occurred. She was beaten and sexually assaulted with the perpetrator's pistol. She suffered a head wound which was stitched up at the hospital. Afterwards, she had nightly nightmares. She then moved to Frederick, Oklahoma to live with her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Long. Her aunt said that for the first time in Mary's life she was extremely nervous and would not go upstairs by herself or sleep alone.

Three months later, ''Texarkana Gazette'' reporter Lucille Holland was flown to Frederick by a man named Paul Burns to interview her. By the time of the interview, officers had not publicly linked Larey's attack with the recent murders. The report appeared in the May 10 edition of the ''Texarkana Gazette''. Mary said "I would know his voice anywhere. It rings always in my ears. Why didn't he kill me too? He killed so many others." Mary revealed the description of the attacker and believed he was a light-skinned black man, indifference to what Jimmy believes. After the first double murder, Larey went to Texarkana to talk to the police in hopes they would connect the incidents and help identify the murderer; but the Rangers questioned her and insisted she knew who her attacker was. After the second double murder, a Texas Ranger went to Frederick to question her again. Larey, native to Oklahoma, died in [[Billings, Montana]] of cancer in 1965 at the age of 38.

===Richard L. Griffin===
Griffin was a 29 year-old war veteran whom was discharged from the [[Seabees]] in November 1945. He was a carpenter and painter and handled his own contracting.<ref>''Texarkana Daily News'', Monday March 25, 1946</ref> Richard was living with his mother, Mrs. R. H. Griffin, at 155 Robison Courts which was built for servicemen returning from [[World War II]] and no longer exists after undergoing demolition. Griffin attended school in [[Linden, Texas]] and Union Chapel, Cass County. Griffin was last seen around 10 p.m. on Saturday, March 23, in a West 7th street (US Highway 67 West) cafe with his sister, Eleanor, and her boyfriend J. A. Proctor. He was also seen earlier at another West 7th street cafe by friends around 2 p.m. He was found fully clothed on his knees between the front seats of his 1941 Oldsmobile sedan with his pockets turned inside out and his head resting on his crossed hands. He was shot once in the back of the head.

Griffin's body was sent to the Texarkana Funeral Home and was then sent to Union Chapel Methodist church in Cass county at 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, March 26, for funeral services officiated by former pastor Rev. Mr. Everett, assisted by the current Rev. Mr. Curtwright. His burial site is unknown. He was survived by his mother, two brothers (Welborn and David) and two sisters (Miss Eleanor Griffin and Mrs. Merle Curtis).

===Polly Ann Moore===
Moore, a seventeen year-old brunette, graduated from Atlanta, Texas high school in 1945 and worked for the Red River Arsenal (now Red River Army Depot) as a checker since July of that year. She lived at a [[boardinghouse]] with her cousin, Mrs. Ardella Campbell, on the Texas side at 1215 Magnolia St. The home no longer exists as it was demolished for the construction to widen State Line Avenue. She had dated Richard for six weeks at the time of her death. Friends described her as being "homey" as she didn't go out with boys much. She was last seen by friends on Saturday with Richard at 2 p.m. at a W 7th street caf<U+00E9> and then later at 10 p.m. at another caf<U+00E9> on W 7th street. She was having dinner with Richard's sister and her boyfriend. She was found fully clothed wearing her class ring with the inscription "P.A.M. -- '45", which helped identify her. She was sprawled face down across the back seat in Richard's car with a gunshot wound in the back of her head. The picture of her used in the next morning's newspaper was found in her purse which was beside her in the back seat. The picture is of her at her former home in [[Douglassville, Texas]] with her arm wrapped around a black and white dog.

Her body was taken to the Texarkana Funeral Home and was then sent to Hanner Funeral Home in Atlanta, Texas. She is buried at Bryans Mill Cemetery in Cass County, Texas. She was survived by her mother, Lizzie Moore, one brother, Melton, and grandmother, Della Melton.

===Paul Martin===
Paul James Martin was born in [[Smackover, Arkansas]] on May 8, 1929. He worked in his family's ice plant when he was young. His brother, R. S. Martin, Jr., said he was a quiet kid. He was a member of [http://maps.google.com/maps?rlz=1T4ADFA_enUS367US368&q=580+Beech++Texarkana&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=580+Beech+St,+Texarkana,+AR+71854&gl=us&ei=41fMS63RPIKKlwf2nYCFBg&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ8gEwAA Beech Street Baptist church], the same church as Betty Jo. He completed the ninth grade at Arkansas Junior High school. He then attended [[Gulf Coast Military Academy]] at [[Gulfport, Mississippi]] in 1945 before going to school at Kilgore. He was a junior at the time of his death. He and Betty Jo were friends since Fairview kindergarten on the Arkansas side before she moved to the Texas side in 1944. Paul soon moved to Kilgore afterwards.

Before his death, Paul came to Texarkana from Kilgore on Friday, April 12. Paul hung out with his friend, Tom Albritton, that night at Paul's Texarkana residence at [http://maps.google.com/maps?rlz=1T4ADFA_enUS367US368&q=1272+Locust+Texarkana&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=1272+Locust+St,+Texarkana,+AR+71854&gl=us&ei=-UrPS8u3O5Ow9QSn6pnGDw&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ8gEwAA 1222 Locust] (now 1224). The next day he hung out with Betty at her place during the afternoon. He picked up Betty Jo Booker from her regular Saturday night gig at the VFW Club on W. 4th and Oak street early Sunday morning around 2 a.m. He was found dead four hours later, shot to death. His body was lying on its left side beside the north side of North Park road, a mile and a half away from his car. His body was picked up by an East Funeral Home ambulance. His funeral was held two days later at his church, Beech Street Baptist, on April 16, at 10 a.m. during heavy rainfall. He was buried at Hillcrest Cemetery on US 67 W./W. 7th St (Plot: Sec B, Lot 150, Space 3). He was survived by his mother, Mrs. Inez Martin (died in 1972), and three brothers, Jack Martin, Hugh Martin (died in 1974) and R. S. Martin, Jr.

His mother went back to Kilgore the following Wednesday after his death. She stated that she objected to him coming to Texarkana. Not because of a sense of danger in Texarkana, but because she feared for him getting into a wreck on his trip alone.

===Betty Jo Booker===
Betty was born June 5, 1930. She was a junior at Texas High School at the time of her death. She was raised in church and, like her friend Paul, a member of Beech Street Baptist church. She was also a member of Delta Beta Sigma sorority. She was one of four officers in the high school band and played the Bundy E-flat alto saxophone second in Jerry Atkins' orchestra, The Rythmaires, who would play at proms and other events. In 1937 her mother, Bessie Brown, married her stepfather Carl Brown, an employee of the Gifford-Hill Company, several years after the death of her father. She and Paul Martin were friends since kindergarten on the Arkansas side until she moved to the Texas side at [http://maps.google.com/maps?rlz=1T4ADFA_enUS367US368&q=3141+Anthony+Texarkana&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=3141+Anthony+Dr,+Texarkana,+TX+75503&gl=us&ei=bgfMS4qSDpGi9QSK0NC8BA&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ8gEwAA 3105 Anthony Drive].

She was very popular, had many friends, and was well liked in school. She had many boyfriends but none which were serious. She loved music and swimming and liked dancing in programs and recitals. She won many rewards, scholastic, literary and musical, as well as the city-wide Little Miss Texarkana representing the Presbyterian Book Store in 1934.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Sunday, April 21, 1946, front page</ref> She was a near straight-A student who was planning to become a medical technician. After her death, The Rythmaires never played again. The night before the attack, she played at her regular Saturday night gig at the VFW building on 4th and Oak street. She was then picked up by her friend Paul and was headed to a slumber party. She was killed early Sunday morning. Her body was removed by an East Funeral Home ambulance.

Several classmates and her band leader, Jerry Atkins, attended her funeral two days later at her church, Beech Street Baptist. It was held on April 16, at 2 p.m., four hours after Paul's, also during heavy rainfall. Texas High School dismissed at noon that day for her funeral.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Wednesday, April 17, 1946, front page</ref> Hundreds of young people attended the separate funerals. Betty Jo's mother couldn't control her grief as she watched the long line of teenagers file by her casket. Atkins was one of the [[pallbearers]]. She was then buried in [http://maps.google.com/maps?rlz=1T4ADFA_enUS367US368&q=3086+County+Ave+Texarkana&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=3086+County+Ave,+Texarkana,+AR+71854&gl=us&ei=XVTMS86zA4Oclgfi2qCuBg&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ8gEwAA Woodlawn Cemetery] located between 3006 State Line Avenue and 3085 County Avenue. Miss Booker was survived by her mother (died in 1977), stepfather, both grandparents, three aunts and three uncles.

Friends do not know how or why she ended up at Spring Lake Park, knowing that she and Paul were just friends. Even after all this time, classmates of Betty and Paul do not want to be identified. The murders are still vivid. "We were all extremely frightened and extremely upset. And in a way we still are," said one classmate in 1996. Jerry Atkins stated "What happened was so tragic and for many of us who lived through it, the frustration and sadness will always be there." Betty Jo's parents stayed at their Texas home until October '46 when they moved to [http://maps.google.com/maps?rlz=1T4ADFA_enUS367US368&q=1469+Locust+Texarkana&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=1469+Locust+St,+Texarkana,+AR+71854&gl=us&ei=E9HPS4mtOZHc9ASnyZWlCw&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ8gEwAA 1417 Locust] (now 1407?).

===Virgil Starks===
Virgil Starks was a 36 year-old who lived in a modest yet modern ranch-style home on his 500-acre farm for five years and which was located about 10 miles northeast of Texarkana on Highway 67 East. He lived not far from his brother, Charlie, and only two miles away from his father, Jack. Known as a progressive farmer, he was also a welder who would do welding work for neighboring farmers. He had no known enemies and was said to be a neighbor of excellent reputation and was respected and trusted by everyone who knew him. He was a member of the First Methodist church on Sixth and Laurel streets for years.

On Friday, May 3 around 8:50 p.m. Virgil was relaxing in his chair in the sitting room just off of the kitchen and bedroom with a heating pad on his back. He was listening to his favorite radio program and reading the Friday, May 3 edition of the ''Texarkana Gazette'' when he was shot from a closed double window, which faced the highway, three feet behind him. He was shot in the back of the head by two slugs and died almost instantly. His funeral was the following Monday at his church at 2:30 p.m. He was buried in Hillcrest cemetery on Highway 67 West; same cemetery as Paul Martin. He was survived by his wife, parents, sister (Mrs. Millard Boyce, Jr.), brother (Charlie), two nieces, and one nephew.

===Katy Starks===
Katy Starks, 34 at the time, was an attractive brunette married to Virgil Starks and lived at their farmhouse of five years on 500 acres of farmland off Highway 67 East almost 10 miles northeast of Texarkana. Her sister, Mrs. Allen, lived directly across the street from her. She was the daughter of Jim Strickland. A friend had stated that she and Virgil were two of the best people he had ever known. After discovering her husband dead, she ran to telephone police. She rung the phone twice when she was shot two times in the face. One bullet went through the right cheek beside the nose, emerging behind the left ear, and the other in the lower jaw below the lip splintering several teeth and lodging beneath her tongue. She ran to a neighbor's house who then took her to the hospital where she recovered. She eventually remarried. She died in early July 1994 and is buried by Virgil, her first husband, in Hillcrest cemetery.

==The investigators==
===Miller County Chief Sheriff's Deputy Tillman Johnson===
Tillman Johnson was born May 24, 1911 in Stamps, Arkansas. He moved to Texarkana in the 1930s and started working for the Miller County Sheriff's Department in 1938.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Thursday, December 11, 2008, pg.8A</ref> He served two years in the military during World War II before he returned home and worked on the Virgil Starks murder case. He soon became one of the leading investigators. He was a member of First United Methodist Church of East Sixth street. He was the last surviving lawman of the Phantom slayings, and was the "go to" man for the case. He had been contacted from many interested individuals, including television crews, from all over the world, including [[China]], [[Sweden]] and [[Australia]]. He kept many personal files of the case; most of which became the only case files, since many of the original official files, photographs, and police notes went missing from both police departments.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'' special limited edition tabloid ''The Phantom Killer at 50: A Retrospective'', page 17</ref> Johnson firmly believed he caught the Phantom, the leading suspect [[Youell Swinney]].

Johnson retired from the sheriff's office in 1957 and became an [[claims adjuster|insurance adjuster]], which he retired from in the 1970s. He then became a private investigator. Johnson died Wednesday, December 10, 2008 at the age of 97 in a local hospital. He was survived by two sons, a daughter-in-law, one daughter, a son-in-law, two grandsons and granddaughters-in-law, one granddaughter and 12 great-grandchildren. He is buried in Rondo Memorial Cemetery.

Sheriff Presley was the first lawman on the scene of Mary Jeanne Larey's attack, as well as the first and second double murders. He was a member of the Men's Bible Class at First United Methodist Church on Fourth street and State Line Avenue. He was a long-time friend of Texas City Chief of Police Jack N. Runnels.

===Texas City Chief of Police Jack N. Runnels===
Runnels was a long-time friend of Bowie County Sheriff Presley. He was with Presley as they were the first ones called to the scenes of both double murders. Runnels was also the leading investigator of the missing saxophone after it had been found.

==Tradition==
Every October near [[Halloween]], the movie ''The Town That Dreaded Sundown'', which is loosely based on Texas Ranger Captain M. T. "Lone Wolf" Gonzaullas' investigation into the murders, is the last movie shown to the public during "Movies in the Park" at Spring Lake Park (where the second double murder occurred) when the weather permits, or at the [http://maps.google.com/maps?rlz=1T4ADFA_enUS367US368&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=southwest+center+texarkana+tx&fb=1&gl=us&hq=southwest+center&hnear=texarkana+tx&cid=0,0,9569108787362756186&ei=xBHbS7_LL8H7lwfInqCjAg&sa=X&oi=local_result&ct=image&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQnwIwAA Southwest Center] (near where the first double murder occurred) when it does not. Movies in the Park plays four movies in the months of May and October, with ''The Town That Dreaded Sundown'' being last. The free event is sponsored by The Texarkana, Texas [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department|Department of Parks & Recreation]] and is open to all ages. The showing of the movie has been a tradition since 2003. About 600 people showed up at the showing in 2008.<ref>''Texarkana Gazette'', Saturday, October 31, 2009, pg. 2A</ref>

Texarkana, Texas Parks & Recreation Department Director Robby Robertson in 2009 said many people have called and asked for a DVD copy of the film. There is no official release on DVD and it isn't very easy to get. Robertson said, "It's still shown only on VHS tape and those aren't even available anymore." He also said that the city can't go to a local video store to rent or buy the film. Instead, because of legal restrictions, the city has to rent it through a movie distributor for $175 to $200 per showing.
