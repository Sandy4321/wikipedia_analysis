The '''quagga''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|k|w|<U+0259>|'|x|<U+0259>}}) (''Equus quagga quagga'') is an [[extinct]] [[subspecies]] of the [[plains zebra]] that lived in [[South Africa]]. It was long thought to be a distinct species, but recent [[genetic studies]] have shown it to be the southernmost subspecies of the plains zebra. It is considered particularly close to [[Burchell's zebra]]. Its name is derived from the plains zebra's call, which sounds like "kwa-ha-ha".

The quagga is believed to have been around {{convert|257|cm|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|125|<U+2013>|135|cm|ft|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder. It was distinguished from other zebras by its limited pattern of primarily brown and white stripes, mainly on the front part of the body. The rear was brown and without stripes, and therefore more horse-like. The distribution of stripes varied considerably between individuals. Little is known about its behaviour but it may have gathered into herds of 30<U+2013>50 individuals. Quaggas were said to be wild and lively, yet were also considered more docile than Burchell's zebra. They were once found in great numbers in the [[Karoo]] of the former [[Cape Province]] and the southern part of the former [[Orange Free State]] in South Africa.

Since Dutch settlement of South Africa began, the quagga was heavily hunted, and it competed with domesticated animals for forage. While some individuals were taken to zoos in Europe, breeding programs were not successful. The last wild population lived in the Orange Free State, and the quagga was [[extinct in the wild]] by 1878. The last captive specimen died in Amsterdam on 12 August 1883. Only one quagga was ever photographed alive and only 23 skins are preserved today. In 1984, the quagga was the first extinct animal to have its [[DNA]] analysed, and the [[Quagga Project]] has tried to recreate it by [[selectively breeding]] plains zebras to resemble it.

==Taxonomy==

The name "quagga" is derived from the [[Khoikhoi]] word for ''zebra'' and is [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]], being said to resemble the quagga's call, variously transcribed as "kwa-ha-ha"<ref name=skinner>{{cite book | last = Skinner | first = J.

T | chapter = Equidae}}</ref> or "oug-ga".<ref name="1911 quagga"/> The name is still used [[colloquially]] for the plains zebra.<ref name=skinner /> The quagga was originally classified as a distinct [[species]], ''Equus quagga'', in 1778 by Dutch naturalist [[Pieter Boddaert]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Groves, C.; Grubb, P.|year=2011|title=Ungulate Taxonomy|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=16|isbn=1-4214-0093-6}}</ref> Today, the quagga and the other plains and mountain zebras are placed in the subgenus ''[[Hippotigris]]''.<ref name="Hippotigris"/>

Historically, quagga taxonomy was further complicated by the fact that the extinct southernmost population of [[Burchell's zebra]] (''Equus quagga burchellii'') was thought to be a distinct subspecies (also sometimes thought a full species, ''E. burchellii''). The extant northern population was later named ''Equus quagga antiquorum'', which means that it is today also referred to as ''E. q. burchellii'', after it was realised they were the same population. The extinct population was long thought very close to the quagga, since it also showed limited striping on its hind parts.<ref name="Hippotigris"/> As an example of this, Shortridge placed the two in the now disused [[subgenus]] ''Quagga'' in 1934.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1515/mamm.1981.45.3.321}}</ref> Most experts now suggest that the two subspecies represent two ends of a [[cline (biology)|cline]].<ref name="Walker"/>

Some authors have described the quagga to be a kind of [[wild horse]] rather than a zebra, and one [[craniometric]] study from 1980 seemed to confirm its affiliation with the [[horse]] (''Equus caballus'').<ref name="Walker"/> There has been much debate over the status of the quagga in relation to the plains zebra. It is poorly represented in the fossil record, and the identification of these fossils is uncertain, as they were collected at a time when the name quagga referred to all zebras.<ref name=skinner/> Fossil skulls of ''Equus mauritanicus'' from [[Algeria]] have been claimed to show affinities with the quagga and the plains zebra, but these may be too damaged to definitely conclude anything from.<ref name="Azzaroli">{{Cite doi|10.1007/BF03001000}}</ref> Quaggas have also been identified in [[cave art]] attributed to the [[Bushmen]].<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1017/S0959774302000057}}</ref>

Different subspecies of plains zebra were  recognised as members of ''Equus quagga'' by early researchers, though there was much confusion over which species were valid.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1080/00222933208673614}}</ref> It has also been pointed out that early [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] studies were erroneous, since using skeletons from stuffed specimens can be problematical, as early taxidermists sometimes used [[donkey]] and horse skulls inside their mounts, when the originals were unavailable.<ref name="Project"/> Quagga subspecies were described based on differences in striping patterns, but these differences were since attributed to [[individual variation]] within the same populations.<ref name="ungulates"/> [[Reginald Innes Pocock]] was perhaps the first to suggest that the quagga was a [[subspecies]] of plains zebra in 1902. As the quagga was scientifically described and named before the plains zebra, the [[trinomial nomenclature|trinomial name]] for the quagga becomes ''E. quagga quagga'' under this scheme, and the other subspecies of plains zebra are placed under ''E. quagga'' as well.<ref name="Azzaroli"/>

===Evolution===
[[File:Quagga.jpg|thumb|Painting of a stallion in [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]'s menagerie at Versailles by [[Nicolas Marechal]], 1793]]
The quagga was the first extinct animal to have its [[Deoxyribonucleic acid|DNA]] analysed,<ref name="1984 quagga">{{cite pmid|6504142}}</ref> and this 1984 study launched the field of [[ancient DNA]] analysis. It confirmed that the quagga was more closely related to zebras than to horses,<ref name="smithsonian"/> with the quagga and [[mountain zebra]] (''Equus zebra'') sharing an ancestor 3<U+2013>4 million years ago.<ref name="1984 quagga"/> An [[immunological]] study published the following year found the quagga to be closest to the plains zebra.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1007/BF01951724}}</ref> A 1987 study suggested that the [[mtDNA]] of the quagga diverged at a range of roughly 2% per every one million years, similar to other mammal species, and again confirmed the close relation to the plains zebra.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1007/BF02603111}}</ref>

Later morphological studies came to conflicting conclusions. A 1999 analysis of cranial measurements found that the quagga was as different from the plains zebra as the latter is from the mountain zebra.<ref name="smithsonian"/> A 2004 study of skins and skulls instead suggested that the quagga was not a distinct species, but a subspecies of the plains zebra.<ref name="Hippotigris">{{Cite doi|10.1078/1616-5047-00133}}</ref> In spite of these findings, many authors subsequently kept the plains zebra and the quagga as separate species.<ref name=skinner/>

A [[genetic study]] published in 2005 confirmed the sub-specific status of the quagga. It showed that the quagga had little genetic diversity, and that it diverged from the other plains zebra subspecies only between 120,000 and 290,000 years ago, during the [[Pleistocene]], and possibly the penultimate glacial maximum. Its distinct coat pattern perhaps evolved rapidly due to geographical isolation and/or adaptation to a drier environment. In addition, plains zebra subspecies tend to have less striping the further south they live, and the quagga was the most southern-living of them all. Other large African [[ungulates]] diverged into separate species and subspecies during this period as well, probably due to the same climate shift.<ref name="smithsonian">{{Cite doi|10.1098/rsbl.2005.0323}}</ref>

==Description==
[[Image:Quagga in enclosure.jpg|thumb|left|The mare in London Zoo, 1870]]
The quagga is believed to have been {{convert|257|cm|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|125|<U+2013>|135|cm|ft|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder.<ref name="Walker"/> The coat pattern of the quagga was unique among [[equids]]. It was zebra-like in the front part, but its rear part looked more like a horse.<ref name="smithsonian"/> It had brown stripes on the head and neck, brown upper parts and a white belly, tail and legs. The stripes were darkest on the head and neck, and became gradually lighter further down the body, blending with the reddish brown of the back and flanks, until disappearing along the back. However it appears to have had a high degree of [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]], with some individuals having almost no stripes and others having striping patterns similar to the extinct southern population of Burchell's zebra, where the stripes covered most of the body except for the hind parts, legs and belly.<ref name="Walker"/> It also had a broad dark dorsal stripe on its back. It had a standing [[mane (horse)|mane]], with brown and white stripes.<ref name="1911 quagga">{{1911|wstitle=Quagga}}</ref>
[[File:Quagga-london.jpg|thumb|Specimen in [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], London]]
The only quagga to have been photographed alive was a [[mare]] at the [[Zoological Society of London]]'s [[London Zoo|Zoo]]. Five photographs of this specimen are known, and it died in 1872.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last =  Huber | first =  W. | author-link =   | title =  Dokumentation der f<U+00FC>nf bekannten Lebendaufnahmen vom Quagga, ''Equus quagga quagga'' Gmelin, 1788 (Mammalia, Perissodactyla, Equidae) | journal = Spixiana  | volume = 17  | pages = 193<U+2013>199  | language =  German | year = 1994 }}</ref> On the basis of photographs and written descriptions, many observers suggest that the configuration of stripes on the quagga is light stripes on a dark background, contrary to the configuration in other zebras. [[Reinhold Rau]], pioneer of the [[Quagga Project]], claimed that this is an [[optical illusion]]: that the base colour is a creamy white and that the stripes are thick and dark.<ref name="Walker"/> However, [[embryological]] evidence instead supports zebras being dark coloured with white as an addition.<ref>{{cite book|author=Prothero, D. R.; Schoch, R. M.|year=2003|title=Horns, Tusks, and Flippers: The Evolution of Hoofed Mammals|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=221|isbn=0-8018-7135-2}}</ref>

Living in the very southern end of the plains zebra's range, the quagga had a thick [[Coat (animal)|winter coat]] that [[Moulting|moulted]] each year. Its skull was described as having a straight profile and a [[wikt:concavity|concave]] [[Diastema (dentistry)|distema]], and as being relatively broad, with a narrow [[occiput]].<ref name="Hippotigris"/><ref name="Kingdon">{{cite book|author=Kingdon, J.|year=1988|title=East African Mammals: An Atlas of Evolution in Africa, Volume 3, Part B: Large Mammals|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=139|isbn=0-226-43722-1}}</ref> Like other plains zebras, the quagga did not have a [[dewlap]] on its neck, as is present on the mountain zebra.<ref name="Azzaroli"/> The 2004 morphological study found that the skeletal features of the southern Burchell's zebra population and the quagga overlapped, and that they were impossible to distinguish. Some specimens also appeared to be intermediate between the two in striping, and individuals of the extant Burchell's zebra population still exhibit limited striping. It can therefore be concluded that the two subspecies graded morphologically into each other. Today, some stuffed specimens of quaggas and southern Burchell's zebra are so similar that they are impossible to definitely identify as either, since no location data was recorded. The female specimens used in the study were larger than the males on average.<ref name="Hippotigris"/>

==Behaviour and ecology==
[[File:Live London quagga.jpg|thumb|right|Fifth known photo of the London Zoo mare, taken in 1864, rediscovered in 1991]]
The quagga was the southernmost distributed plains zebra, mainly living south of the [[Orange River]]. It was a grazer, and its habitat range was restricted to the grasslands and arid interior scrubland of the [[Karoo]] region of [[South Africa]], today forming parts of the provinces of  [[Northern Cape]], [[Eastern Cape]], [[Western Cape]] and the [[Free State (province)|Free State]].<ref name="Walker"/><ref name="Heywood"/> These areas were known for distinctive flora and fauna and high amounts of [[endemism]].<ref name="Kingdon"/><ref name="Moehlmen">{{cite book|author=Hack, M.

R.|title=Equids: Zebras, Asses, and Horses: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan|publisher=IUCN/SSC Equid Specialist Group|page=44|isbn=2-8317-0647-5}}</ref>

Little is known about the behaviour of quaggas in the wild, and it is sometimes unclear what exact species of zebra is referred to in old reports.<ref name="Walker"/> The only source that unequivocally describes the quagga in the Free State is that of the English military engineer and hunter [[William Cornwallis Harris|Major Sir William Cornwallis Harris]].<ref name="Hippotigris"/> His 1840 account reads as follows:
<blockquote>"The geographical range of the quagga does not appear to extend to the northward of the river Vaal. The animal was formerly extremely common within the colony; but, vanishing before the strides of civilisation, is now to be found in very limited numbers and on the borders only. Beyond, on those sultry plains which are completely taken possession of by wild beasts, and may with strict propriety be termed the domains of savage nature, it occurs in interminable herds; and, although never intermixing with its more elegant congeners, it is almost invariably to be found ranging with the white-tailed gnu and with the ostrich, for the society of which bird especially it evinces the most singular predilection. Moving slowly across the profile of the ocean-like horizon, uttering a shrill, barking neigh, of which its name forms a correct imitation, long files of quaggas continually remind the early traveller of a rival caravan on its march. Bands of many hundreds are thus frequently seen doing their migration from the dreary and desolate plains of some portion of the interior, which has formed their secluded abode, seeking for those more luxuriant pastures where, during the summer months, various herbs thrust forth their leaves and flowers to form a green carpet, spangled with hues the most brilliant and diversified."<ref name="CassellNH">Sir Cornwallis Harris, quoted in {{cite book|author=Duncan, F. M.|title=Cassell's natural history|year=1913|pages=350<U+2013>351|url=http://archive.org/stream/cassellsnaturalh00duncrich#page/350/mode/2up |publisher=Cassell |location=London |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref></blockquote>
[[Image:Agasse Quagga.jpg|thumb|right|Live stallion at the [[Royal College of Surgeons]], painted by [[Jacques-Laurent Agasse]] in the early 1800s]]
Quaggas have been reported gathering into herds of 30<U+2013>50 individuals and sometimes travelled in a linear fashion.<ref name="Walker"/> They may have been [[Sympatry|sympatic]] with Burchell's zebra between the [[Vaal River|Vaal]] and Orange rivers.<ref name="Hippotigris"/><ref name="Moehlmen"/> However, this is disputed,<ref name="Hippotigris"/> and there is no evidence that they interbred.<ref name="Moehlmen"/> It could also have shared a small portion of its range with [[Hartmann's mountain zebra]] (''Equus zebra hartmannae'').<ref name="smithsonian"/> 

Since the practical function of striping has not been determined for zebras in general, it is unclear why the quagga lacked stripes on its hind parts. A [[Crypsis|cryptic]] function for protection from predators (stripes obscure the individual zebra in a herd) and [[tsetse flies]] (these flies are less attracted to striped objects), as well as various social functions, have been proposed for zebras in general. Differences in hind quarter stripes may have aided [[species recognition]] during stampedes of mixed herds, so that members of one subspecies or species would follow its own kind. It has also been hypothesised that the zebras developed striping patterns as [[thermoregulation]] to cool themselves down, and that the quagga lost them due to living in a cooler climate, although one problem with this is that the mountain zebra lives in similar environments and has a bold striping pattern.<ref name=fitness>{{Cite doi|10.1046/j.1365-2907.2002.00108.x}}</ref>

Quaggas were said to be lively and highly strung, especially the stallions. During the 1830s, quaggas were used as harness animals for carriages in London, the males probably being [[gelded]], due to their volatile nature.<ref name="Piper2009">{{cite book|last=Piper|first=R.|title=Extinct animals: an encyclopedia of species that have disappeared during human history|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=k2tFAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=23 June 2013|date=20 March 2009|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-34987-4}}</ref> Local farmers used them as guards for their livestock, as they were likely to attack intruders.<ref name="Weddell"/> On the other hand, captive quaggas in European zoos were said to be tamer and more docile than Burchell's zebra.<ref name="Walker"/> One specimen was reported to have lived in captivity for 21 years and 4 months, dying in 1872.<ref name="Walker">{{cite book|author=Nowak, R.

==Decline and extinction==
[[File:Em - Equus quagga quagga - GMZ 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Skeleton at the [[Grant Museum]]]]
As they were easy to find and kill, the quagga was hunted by early Dutch settlers and later by [[Afrikaner]]s to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or used locally. It is probable that the quagga was vulnerable to extinction due to its limited distribution, and it may have competed with domestic livestock for forage.<ref name="Weddell">{{cite book|author=Weddell, B. J.|year=2002|title=Conserving Living Natural Resources: In the Context of a Changing World|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=46|isbn=0-521-78812-9}}</ref> The quagga had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, located in the Orange Free State, was extirpated in the late 1870s.<ref name="Walker"/> The last known wild individual died in 1878.<ref name="Weddell"/>

Individual quaggas were also captured and shipped to Europe where they were displayed in zoos.<ref name="Walker"/> [[George Douglas, 16th Earl of Morton|Lord Morton]] tried to save the animal from extinction by starting a captive breeding program. However, he was only able to obtain a single male which, in desperation, he bred with a female horse. This produced a female hybrid which bore the zebra stripes on its back and legs. [[Lord Morton's mare]] was sold and was subsequently bred with a black stallion, resulting in offspring that again had zebra stripes. An account of this was published in 1820 by the [[Royal Society]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Birkhead, T.

===Breeding back project===
{{main|Quagga Project}}
After the very close relationship between the quagga and surviving zebras was discovered, the Quagga Project was started in 1986 by Reinhold Rau in South Africa to recreate the quagga by [[selective breeding]] from plains zebra stock, with the eventual aim of reintroducing them to the wild. The founding population consisted of 19 individuals from Namibia and South Africa, chosen because they had reduced striping on the rear body and legs. The first foal of the project was born in 1988. Once a sufficiently quagga-like population has been created, it will be released in the Western Cape.<ref name="Project">{{Cite doi|10.3957/056.039.0206}}</ref> In early 2006, the third and fourth generation animals produced by the project were reported to look very much like the depictions and preserved specimens of the quagga. This type of selective breeding is also called ''[[breeding back]]''. The practice of breeding back is controversial, since the resulting zebras will only resemble the quaggas in external appearance, but genetically they will be different.  The technology to use recovered DNA for cloning does not exist.<ref name="nytimes2006">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/01/magazine/01taxidermy.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print |title=Can You Revive an Extinct Animal? |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=1 January 2006 |accessdate=14 October 2011 |first=D.
