'''Coca-Cola Field''' (formerly '''Dunn Tire Park''', '''North AmeriCare Park''', '''Downtown Ballpark''' and '''Pilot Field''') is a 18,025-seat [[baseball park]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] that hosted its first regular season baseball game on April 14, 1988, as the tenants of the facility, the [[Buffalo Bisons]], defeated the [[New Orleans Zephyrs|Denver Zephyrs]], 1-0.<ref>[http://buffalo.bisons.milb.com/ballpark/page.jsp?ymd=20060128&content_id=39578&vkey=ballpark_t422&fext=.jsp&sid=t422]</ref>

[[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] is often considered the trendsetter among American cities towards retro-styled, baseball-only stadiums located in downtown cores.  However, the architectural firm that designed Camden Yards, HOK Sport (now known as [[Populous (architects)|Populous]]), originally implemented its design with Coca-Cola Field, which opened four years prior.

At the time of the stadium's construction, Buffalo was hoping to secure either an expansion [[Major League Baseball]] team or a relocated team.  The [[Montreal Expos]] and [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] were often mentioned as a leading contender in the latter category and Buffalo was one of the five finalists in the 1993 National League expansion derby, which brought the [[Colorado Rockies]] and [[Florida Marlins]] to Major League Baseball.  When completed, however, the stadium seated fewer than 20,000 people.  While this was a large number of seats for a minor-league facility, it was dwarfed by many major-league parks.  Thus, the design made provisions for future expansion that would have allowed the [[seating capacity]] to grow to nearly 40,000 by adding an upper deck above the existing mezzanine should a major-league team decide to relocate to Buffalo.

In the first season the Bisons played at the stadium, the team shattered the previous minor-league attendance record, as many Buffalonians and visitors traveled downtown to enjoy the amenities offered by the new facility, which replaced the old [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|War Memorial Stadium]] as the Bisons' home.  In this first season, the Bisons outdrew a number of Major League teams.

After several years as Pilot Field, there was a dispute involving the naming rights to the stadium following Pilot Air Freight's defaulting on naming rights payments.  For part of a season, the stadium was known locally simply as the "Downtown Ballpark."  In July 1995, however, another company stepped in and acquired the naming rights, and the stadium became known as North AmeriCare Park.  The stadium maintained this moniker for only a few years, however.  Prior to the start of the 1999 season, Dunn Tire, a local chain of retail tire outlets, became the naming rights holder for the stadium, thus the name Dunn Tire Park. On December 17, 2008, the ''Buffalo News'' reported that a new naming deal has been reached, with the stadium renamed as Coca-Cola Field for the 2009 season.<ref>[http://www.buffalonews.com/home/story/525364.html]</ref>  

Coca-Cola Field was also home to the Buffalo Nighthawks of the Women's Baseball League in 1998.  Other events hosted at the stadium include the "Ballpark Brawl" annual wrestling events, and the annual [[National Buffalo Wing Festival]] on Labor Day Weekend. Also, it is the host of [[WYRK]]'s TASTE of Country.

Before the baseball field was built, the corner of Swan and Washington was the site of [[Ellsworth Statler]]'s first hotel, [[Statler Hotel]].<ref>Western New York Heritage Press[http://wnyheritagepress.org/photos_week_2007/statler/hotel/statler_hotel.htm]</ref>  It was later called the Hotel Buffalo after Statler built a new Statler Hotel on Niagara Square in 1923 and sold this one.  Before the Statler Hotel here was St. John's [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] Church.

Coca-Cola Field is served by the [[Seneca (Metro Rail)|Seneca]] station on the [[Buffalo Metro Rail]].

As of 2010, the field will become the highest-capacity minor league baseball stadium in the United States.<ref>http://www.wben.com/Buffalo-Among-the--Top-Ten-Places-for-a-Baseball-P/6724755</ref>
