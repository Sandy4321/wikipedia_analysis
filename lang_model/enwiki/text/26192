'''Rudolph Cartier''' (born '''Rudolph Katscher''';<ref name="mobc">{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/cartierrudo/cartierrudo.htm|title=Cartier, Rudolph|first=Jason|last=Jacobs|publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref> [[April 17]] [[1904]]&ndash;[[June 7]] [[1994]]) was an [[Austria]]n [[television director]] who worked predominantly in [[British television]], exclusively for the [[BBC]]. He is best known for his 1950s collaborations with the [[screenwriter]] [[Nigel Kneale]], most notably the ''[[Quatermass]]'' serials and their [[Nineteen Eighty-Four (TV programme)|1954 adaptation]] of [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.

After studying architecture and then drama, Cartier's initial career was as a screenwriter and then [[film director]] in [[Berlin]], working for [[Universum Film AG|UFA Studios]]. After a brief spell in the [[United States]] he moved to the [[United Kingdom]] in the 1930s, and began working for [[BBC Television]] in 1952. He went on to produce and direct over 120 productions until his final television work in 1976.

Active in both [[dramatic programming]] and [[opera]], Cartier won the equivalent of a [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA]] in 1957 for his work in the former, and one of his operatic productions was given an award at the 1962 [[Salzburg Festival]]. The [[British Film Institute]]'s "[[Screenonline]]" website describes him as "a true pioneer of television,"<ref name="screenonline">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1181098/index.html|title=Cartier, Rudolph (1904&ndash;1994)|first=Oliver|last=Wake|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref> while the critic Peter Black once wrote that: "Nobody was within a mile of Rudolph Cartier in the trick of making a picture on a TV screen seem as wide and as deep as [[CinemaScope]]."<ref name="times">{{cite news|title=Rudolph Cartier; Obituary|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=[[1994-06-10]]|page=21}}</ref>

==Early life and career==
Born in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (now Austria), he initially studied to become an [[architect]], before he changed career paths and enrolled to study drama at the Vienna Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.<ref name="mobc"/><ref name="times"/> There he was taught by [[Max Reinhardt (theatre director)|Max Reindhart]], whose influence had a great effect upon him.<ref name="mobc"/> Reindhart thought of a script as being similar to a [[musical score]], which should be interpreted by a director in the same way as a musician interpreting a piece of music, and this was an approach with which Cartier agreed.<ref name="times"/>

He became involved in the [[film]] industry in 1929, when he successfully submitted a script to a company based in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].<ref name="mobc"/> He then became a staff scriptwriter for [[Universum Film AG|UFA Studios]], the primary German film company of the era, for whom he worked on [[crime film]]s and [[thriller (genre)|thrillers]].<ref name="murray22">Murray, p. 22.</ref> While at UFA, he worked with noted writers, directors and producers such as [[Ewald Andr<U+00E9> Dupont]] and [[Erich Pommer]].<ref name="times"/> In 1933 he became a [[film director]], overseeing the thriller ''Unsichtbare Gegner'' for producer [[Sam Spiegel]].<ref name="screenonline"/>

The same year as ''Unsichtbare Gegner'' was released, the [[Nazism|Nazis]] came to power in Germany, and Cartier &mdash; who was [[Jew]]ish &mdash; left the country.<ref name="screenonline"/> Another of his UFA colleagues, [[Billy Wilder]], encouraged Cartier to accompany him to [[Hollywood]], which he did &mdash; it was at this point that he [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] his surname.<ref name="murray22"/> However, unlike Wilder Cartier did not find success in the [[United States]], and in 1935 he [[Immigration|immigrated]] to the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name="times1958">{{cite news|title=The Man Who Put 1984 Over on Television|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=[[1958-12-01]]|page=14}}</ref> Several members of Cartier's family, including his mother, remained in Europe and were killed in [[The Holocaust]].<ref name="screenonline"/>

Little further is recorded of Cartier's career until after the [[World War II|Second World War]], when he began writing [[storyline]]s for several minor [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British films]].<ref name="screenonline"/> He also worked as a [[film producer]], overseeing a 1951 [[short film]] adaptation of the [[Sherlock Holmes]] story ''[[The Man with the Twisted Lip]]''.<ref name="credits">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1181098/credits.html|title=Cartier, Rudolph (1904&ndash;94) &mdash; Film & TV credits|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-02-24}}</ref> He returned for a time to the United States, where he studied production methods in the new medium of [[television]].<ref name="times1958"/> In 1948 he had briefly worked with [[BBC Television]] producer [[Michael Barry]] on a film project that did not come to fruition.<ref name="screenonline"/> In 1952 Barry became the new Head of Drama at BBC Television, and interviewed Cartier for a post as a staff [[television producer]] in the drama department.<ref name="jacobs131">Jacobs, p. 131.</ref> At the time, the post of television producer combined both producing and directing a programme.<ref name="screenonline"/>

At his interview, Cartier told Barry that he thought his department's output was "dreadful,"<ref name="jacobs132">Jacobs, p. 132.</ref> and that television drama needed "new scripts and a new approach."<ref name="mobc"/> He was even more forthright in a 1990 interview about his career, telling [[BBC Two]]'s ''[[The Late Show (BBC2 TV series)|The Late Show]]'' that the BBC drama department had "needed me like water in the desert."<ref name="cooke20">Cooke, p. 20.</ref> Barry, however, shared many of Cartier's views on the need to improve television drama,<ref name="times"/> and hired him for the producer's job.<ref name="jacobs132"/>

==BBC television==
Cartier's first BBC television production was a play entitled ''Arrow to the Heart'', transmitted on the evening of [[July 20]] [[1952]].<ref name="credits"/> It was adapted by Cartier himself from the German novel ''Unruhige Nacht'' by [[Albrecht Goes]], but Barry felt that the dialogue was not quite right, and assigned drama department staff scriptwriter [[Nigel Kneale]] to edit the script.<ref name="murray2223">Murray, pp. 22&ndash;23.</ref> It was the first of many collaborations between the pair, who enjoyed a highly productive working relationship, although at times they could become involved in deep creative arguments concerning particular elements of a production.<ref name="pixley4">Pixley, p. 4.</ref> They were an important presence in British television drama of the era: writing in 2003, the television historian Lez Cooke said that: "Between them, Kneale and Cartier were responsible for introducing a completely new dimension to television drama in the early to mid-1950s."<ref name="cooke20">Cooke, p. 20.</ref> 

Their first major production was the six-part serial ''[[The Quatermass Experiment]]'', broadcast in the summer of 1953. A [[science-fiction]] story, it related the tale of the eponymous [[Bernard Quatermass|Professor Bernard Quatermass]] sending the first humans into space, and the consequences when an alien presence invades their rocket during its flight and returns to Earth in the body of the one remaining crewmember. A critical and popular success, ''The Quatermass Experiment'' was described by the [[British Film Institute]]'s "[[Screenonline]]" website as "one of the most influential series of the 1950s."<ref name="bfiexp">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/471469/index.html|title=Quatermass Experiment, The (1953)|first=Gavin|last=Collinson|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref> Cartier's contribution to the serial's success was highlighted in his 1994 obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, which said that the serial: "became a landmark in British television drama as much for its visual imagination as for its ability to shock and disturb."<ref name="times"/>

The success of ''The Quatermass Experiment'' led to two sequels, ''[[Quatermass II]]'' (1955) and ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'' (1958&ndash;59), both produced and directed by Cartier and written by Kneale. Both of these were also very successful and critically-acclaimed productions,<ref name="quatermass2">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/441212/index.html|title=Quatermass II (1955)|first=Mark|last=Duguid|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref><ref name="pit">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/438573/index.html|title=Quatermass and the Pit (1958&ndash;59)|first=Mark|last=Dugoid|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref> and Cartier's production work on them became increasingly ambitious. For ''Quatermass II'', he pre-filmed a significant amount of material [[filming location|on location]] on [[35 mm film]], expanding the drama away from the usual studio-bound television settings with the most ambitious location shooting that had yet been attempted in British television.<ref name="pixley19">Pixley, p. 19.</ref> Cartier, with his previous experience as a film director, particularly enjoyed working on these cinema-style filmed scenes.<ref name="pixley20">Pixley, p. 20.</ref>

Away from the ''Quatermass'' serials, Cartier and Kneale collaborated on several one-off dramas, including literary and theatrical adaptations ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' ([[December 6]] [[1953]]) and ''The Moment of Truth'' ([[March 10]] [[1955]]), and Kneale's own ''The Creature'' ([[January 30]] [[1955]]).<ref name="pixley16">Pixley, p. 16.</ref> Of particular note was their collaboration on [[Nineteen Eighty-Four (TV programme)|an adaptation]] of [[George Orwell]]'s famous [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', originally broadcast on [[December 12]] [[1954]] and regarded as Cartier's most famous work.<ref name="times"/>

Described by ''The Times'''s review the day after its broadcast as having a "vividness... the two minutes' hate was, for instance, a wonderfully riotious orgy of vindictiveness,"<ref name="times1954">{{cite news|title=Nineteen Eighty-Four &mdash; Orwell's Novel on Television|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=[[1954-12-13]]|page=11}}</ref> the production also attracted a considerable degree of controversy. There were questions asked in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] concerning some of the graphic scenes of horror in the play,<ref name="bbcobit">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6105578.stm|title=Quatermass creator dies, aged 84|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=[[2006-11-01]]|accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref> and the BBC received several telephone calls threatening Cartier's life if the second [[live television|live]] performance, scheduled for December 16, went ahead.<ref name="cooke27">Cooke, p. 27.</ref> The BBC took these threats seriously enough to assign him bodyguards.<ref name="cooke27"/> Cartier appeared live on television himself to defend the production in a studio debate, and eventually the [[Board of Governors of the BBC]] voted that the second performance should go ahead as planned.<ref name="murray39">Murray, p. 39.</ref> The production had by this time received some notable backing; [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] commented during a speech to the [[Royal Society of Arts]] that he and [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] had watched and enjoyed the first performance.<ref name="murray3839">Murray, pp. 38&ndash;39.</ref>

''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' had been a success, but it was also one of the most expensive television dramas that had then been made in the UK.<ref name="screen1984">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/438460/index.html|title=Nineteen Eighty-Four (1954)|first=Mark|last=Dugoid|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref> Cartier often spent large amounts of money on his productions, and earlier in 1954 Michael Barry had heavily criticised him for the money and resources he had employed in an adaptation of ''[[Rebecca (novel)|Rebecca]]''. In a memo to Cartier written after that production's transmission, Barry admonished Cartier for his over-ambitious production. <blockquote>"The performance of ''Rebecca'' seems to me to have taken us further into the danger area instead of showing any improvement. I am unable to defend at a time when departmental costs and scene loads are in an acute state the load imposed by ''Rebecca'' on Design and Supply and the expenditure upon [[Extra (actor)|extras]] and costumes... the vast area of the hall and the stairway never justified the great expenditure of effort required in building and one is left with a very clear impression of reaching a point where the department must be accused of not knowing what it is doing."<ref name="jacobs134">Jacobs, p. 134.</ref></blockquote>

Despite Barry's concerns, Cartier continued to work successfully in television, and at the [[Guild of Television Producers and Directors Awards 1957|1957 Guild of Television Producers and Directors Awards]] (later known as the [[British Academy Television Awards]], or BAFTAs) he was the winner of the Drama category.<ref name="mobc"/> He made a brief return to film-making in 1958 when he directed the feature ''Passionate Summer'', but he saw himself primarily as a television director, and it remained his favourite medium.<ref name="screenonline"/> "The essence of television is that you can control the viewer's response to a much greater extent than other media permit," he told ''The Times'' in 1958.<ref name="times1958"/>

He did not direct only dramas, however. Cartier had a great passion for [[opera]], and this enthusiasm saw him directing several operatic productions for BBC television.<ref name="times"/> He oversaw adaptations of established operas such as ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' (1957) and ''[[Carmen]]'' (1962) as well as original productions written especially for television.<ref name="screenonline"/> ''Tobias and the Angel'', written for the BBC by [[Arthur Bliss|Sir Arthur Bliss]] and [[Christopher Hassall]] and produced by Cartier in 1960, won the Merit Award in the Salaburg Opera Prize at the 1962 [[Salzburg Festival]].<ref name="slazburg">{{cite news|title=Salzburg Award for B.B.C. TV Opera|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=[[1962-08-27]]|page=12}}</ref>

Cartier continued to direct television dramas during the 1960s, although after Barry stepped down as Head of Drama in 1961 he lost much of his creative independence. Barry's successor, [[Sydney Newman]], abolished the BBC's traditional producer-director role and split the responsibilities into separate posts, leaving directors such as Cartier with less control over their productions.<ref name="screenonline"/> He also found himself assigned to direct episodes of regular drama series, as such as ''[[Maigret]]'' and ''[[Z-Cars]]''.<ref name="screenonline"/>

He was still able to direct several notable productions during the decade, including several which explored the Nazi era in Germany from which he had escaped in 1933. These incluced the World War II dramas ''Cross of Iron'' (1961, dealing with the [[court martial]] of a [[U-Boat]] captain in a British [[prisoner of war]] camp) and ''The July Plot'' (1964, about the [[July 20 Plot|1944 plot to assassinate Hitler]]), as well as ''Firebrand'' (1967, about the 1933 [[Reichstag fire]], an event Cartier had personally witnessed).<ref name="screenonline"/> He also began, for the first time, to direct pieces which dealt with history to which he had a more personal connection, The Holocaust. These included ''Doctor Korczak and the Children'' (1962, concerning the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] orphanage) and ''The [[Joel Brand]] Story'' (1965, about [[Adolf Eichmann]]'s 1944 offer to [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]] of the lives of 1 million Jews in exchange for 10,000 trucks).<ref name="screenonline"/> Other notable 1960s productions included adaptations of ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' (1961, starring [[Sean Connery]] and [[Claire Bloom]]) and ''Wuthering Heights'' (1962, a new version of Kneale's 1953 script, starring Bloom and [[Keith Michell]]).<ref name="screenonline"/><ref name="wuthering">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1203222/index.html|title=Wuthering Heights (1962)|first=Oliver|last=Wake|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref> ''Lee Oswald &mdash; Assassin'' (1966) was a [[Docudrama|drama-documentary]] telling the story of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], based on the [[Warren Commission]]'s findings, while ''Conversation at Night'' (1969) saw the first ever television acting appearance of [[Alec Guinness]].<ref name="screenonline"/>

Cartier continued directing into the 1970s, helming episodes of ''[[Fall of Eagles]]'' (1974).<ref name="credits"/> His final directing credit came on the play ''Loyalties'', screened in 1976.<ref name="credits"/> By this time, he had worked on over 120 productions for the BBC.<ref name="times"/> Subsequently, he worked for a time for the BBC's "purchased drama" department, advising on which plays and series might be bought-in from European broadcasters.<ref name="times"/> Throughout his career he refused ever to work for [[commercial television]], disliking the idea of [[Television advertisement|adverts]] interrupting his work. "I hate the idea of my creative work being constantly interrupted for commercial reasons. I am an artist, not a salesman," he once commented.<ref name="times"/> 

He was married three times, lastly to Margaret Pepper, who he married in 1949 and remained with until his death.<ref name="mobc"/> He had one daughter with Pepper, and another from a previous marriage.<ref name="times"/> He died on [[June 7]] [[1994]], at the age of 90; his death was overshadowed in the media by that of [[Dennis Potter]], another important figure in the history of British television drama, who died on the same day.<ref name="murray175">Murray, p. 175.</ref>

==Legacy==
Nearly all of Cartier's 1950s television productions were performed [[live television|live]], and the majority of them were not recorded &mdash; he once described them as being "gone with the speed of light."<ref name="screenonline"/> Several of those which do survive have been highly regarded by later reviewers. In 2000, the [[British Film Institute]] (BFI) compiled a list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century. Voted on by a group of industry professionals, the list featured both ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' and ''Quatermass and the Pit''.<ref name="tv100">{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/list.php|title=The BFI TV 100: 1-100|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|date=2000|accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref> In the accompanying analysis of each entry to the list, ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' was described as "An early example of the power of television drama... Even now, the torture sequences retain their power to shock and disturb."<ref name="tv10084">{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/prog.php?id=73|title=73: Nineteen Eighty-Four|first=Mark|last=Duguid|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|date=2000|accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref>

Nigel Kneale, scriptwriter of both of the Cartier dramas acclaimed by the BFI, felt that the productions would not have been as successful as they were had they been handled by any other director. "I don't think any of the things I wrote then would have come to anything much in other hands. In his they worked."<ref name="conv">{{cite video|people=[[Nigel Kneale]]|year=2005|title=Cartier & Kneale in Conversation|format=Documentary using archive interview material. Extra feature on ''The Quatermass Collection'' set|accessdate=2007-02-25|medium=[[DVD]]|publisher=[[BBC Worldwide]]}}</ref> Television historian Jason Jacobs, a lecturer in [[Film studies|film]] and [[television studies]] at the [[University of Warwick]], wrote in 2000 that Kneale and Cartier together created an entirely new, more expansive vision for British television drama in the 1950s.<blockquote>"It was the arrival of Nigel Kneale... and Rudolph Cartier... that challenged the intimate drama directly. Cartier is rightly recognised as a major influence on the visual development of British television drama... Cartier and Kneale had the ambition for their productions to have an impact on a mass audience, and the scope of their attention was not confined to the 'cosy' aesthetics of intimacy. Cartier uses the [[close-up]] both to reveal emotions and as a shock device: a more threatening &mdash; and perhaps exhilerating &mdash; method than was used before. 'Intimacy' is reformulated by Carier in terms of his power and control over the viewer &mdash; no longer a part of the family, but isolated in his home."<ref name="jacobs130131137">Jacobs, pp. 130&ndash;131 and p. 137.</ref></blockquote>

Cartier's pioneering use of an increased number of pre-filmed sequences to open out the studio-bound, live television drama productions of the 1950s is also praised by Lez Cooke. "While film inserts were being used in television drama from the early 1950s, ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' represented the most extensive use of them in a TV play up to that time, and signalled Cartier's determination to extend the boundaries of TV drama."<ref name="cooke25">Cooke, p. 25.</ref> Similarly, his ''Times'' obituary stated that: "At a time when studio productions were usually as static as the conventional theatre, he was widely respected for a creative contribution to British television drama which gave it a new dimension."<ref name="times"/>

It was not only Cartier's 1950s productions that gained critical praise; several of his later works have also been regarded as influential. His 1962 production of ''Wuthering Heights'' was praised by Dennis Potter, then a television critic, who wrote in ''[[Daily Herald]]'' newspaper that the production "was like a thunderstorm on the flat, dreary plains of the week's television... The howl of the wind against the windows, the muted pain of Claire Bloom as the wretched Cathy, and the hunted misery of Keith Mitchell as Heathcliff, made this a more than adequate offering of a great work."<ref name="wuthering"/> While "Screenonline" states that ''Lee Oswald &mdash; Assassin'' (1966) "could be argued [to be] of historical interest only," due to its basis in the flawed [[Warren Commission]] report,<ref name="oswald">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1181129/index.html|title=Lee Oswald &mdash; Assassin (1966)|first=Oliver|last=Wake|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref> ''The Times'' praised it as being "possibly the first drama-documentary."<ref name="times"/> 

Speaking to ''The Times'' in 1958, Cartier felt that television was still developing as a medium, and that part of his work was to help create the next generation of those who would produce television drama. "The BBC is producing producers as well as plays. They are feeling their way towards what television drama will one day be, and we are trying to create a generation of writers who study the medium."<ref name="times1958"/> His 1994 obituary in the same newspaper felt that he had been successful in creating a lasting influence on later producers, describing his 1962 production of the opera ''Carmen'' as "an example and inspiration to a younger generation of television producers."<ref name="times"/>

In 1990, the [[BBC Two]] [[The arts|arts]] magazine programme ''[[The Late Show (BBC2 TV series)|The Late Show]]'' produced an edition which featured a retrospective of Cartier's work, including a new interview with the director discussing his career.<ref name="pixley40">Pixley, p. 40.</ref> This feature was repeated on BBC Two under the title ''Rudolph Cartier: A Television Pioneer'' on [[July 1]] [[1994]], followed by a tribute screening of the surviving [[telerecording]] copy of the second performance of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''.<ref name="cooke199">Cooke, p. 199.</ref>
