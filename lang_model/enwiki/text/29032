'''Wu Kung-i''' also known as Wu Kung-yi or Wu Gongyi (<U+5433><U+516C><U+5100> [[1900]]-[[1970]]), was a well known teacher of the [[Nei chia|soft style]] [[martial art]] known as [[T'ai Chi Ch'uan]] in [[China]], and, after [[1949]], in the [[British colony]] of [[Hong Kong]]. He was also the "gate-keeper" of the Wu family from 1942 until his death in 1970.

Wu Kung-i was the grandson of the founder of [[Wu style T'ai Chi Ch'uan]], [[Wu Ch'uan-y<U+00FC>]] (<U+5433><U+5168><U+4F51>, [[1834]]-[[1902]]). Wu Ch'uan-y<U+00FC> was taught T'ai Chi Ch'uan by [[Yang Lu-ch'an]] (<U+694A><U+9732><U+79AA> [[1799]]-[[1872]]), starting in [[1850]]. Wu Ch'uan-y<U+00FC> eventually became the senior disciple of Yang's son, [[Yang Pan-hou]] (<U+694A><U+73ED><U+4FAF> [[1837]]-[[1890]]), and was given permission by the Yangs to teach his own students in [[1870]]. Wu Ch'uan-y<U+00FC>'s son, [[Wu Chien-ch'uan|Wu Chien-ch'<U+00FC>an]] (<U+5433><U+9451><U+6CC9> [[1870]]-[[1942]]), became the best known teacher in his family, and is therefore also considered the co-founder of the Wu style.  Wu Kung-i was his eldest son. Wu Kung-i's younger brother and sister, [[Wu Kung-tsao]] (<U+5433><U+516C><U+85FB> [[1903]]-[[1983]]) and [[Wu Ying-hua]] (<U+5433><U+82F1><U+83EF> [[1906]]-[[1996]]), were also well known teachers. The Wu family were originally of [[Manchu]] ancestry.

There was an old tradition in the [[Chinese martial arts]] that youngsters be taught by teachers of a generation older than their parents'. Since Wu Ch'uan-y<U+00FC> had died while Wu Kung-i was an infant, he and his brother were taught as young men by [[Yang Shao-hou]] (<U+694A><U+5C11><U+4FAF> [[1862]]-[[1930]]), who was technically a generation senior to their father. Both Yang Shao-hou and Wu Chien-ch'<U+00FC>an were famous for their "small circle" martial expertise. The motions of T'ai Chi forms and [[pushing hands]] are all based on different sized circles, small circle movements in the forms and applications follow a more compact pathway for different leverage applications than larger circles.

After the fall of the [[Qing dynasty|Ch'ing dynasty]] in [[1912]], a new teaching environment was created. More people became aware of T'ai Chi, and the former dynamic of small classes and intensive military instruction of relatively young students became less practical. Wu Kung-i responded to the new demands of larger class sizes and older beginning level students by changing some aspects of the beginning level [[108 form Wu family T'ai Chi Ch'uan|hand forms]] he taught. His modifications of the "square" forms he had learned from his father and the slightly different form he learned from Yang Shao-hou, distinguished by clear sectional instructions for each move in the form sequence, more compact "small circle" movements in the body and somewhat higher stances with the feet relatively closer together than in other styles of T'ai Chi. Wu also formulated new styles of [[pushing hands]] based on smaller circles, most notably the "four corner" method of basic pushing hands.

Wu Kung-i's children were also full time T'ai Chi teachers; his oldest son [[Wu Ta-kuei]] (<U+5433><U+5927><U+63C6> [[1923]]-[[1972]]), his second son, [[Wu Ta-ch'i]] (<U+5433><U+5927><U+9F4A> [[1926]]-[[1993]]) and his daughter, [[Wu Yan-hsia]] (<U+5433><U+96C1><U+971E> [[1930]]-[[2001]]).

In [[1953]], the fifty three year old Wu was publicly challenged by to a fight by the thirty-something [[Tibetan White Crane]] stylist [[Ch'en K'e-fu]] (<U+9648><U+514B><U+592B>). The contest was arranged and fought in [[Macau]] in January, [[1954]]. The ring was set up as if for a Western [[boxing]] match, and there were many rules prohibiting various techniques being used by the fighters; [[kick]]s, throws or [[Chin na|joint locks]], for example. The contest lasted not quite two rounds.  After repeated strikes to Ch'en's face and forearms by Wu, Ch'en attempted to kick Wu, prompting responding kicks. The judges ended the round, declaring the contest a draw.  This was done to ensure that there was no loss of face to either party.  Both Wu and Ch'en invited the opposing sides to celebratory banquets.  The contest was reported in detail by the media of the day, and resulted in many new students for the Wu family school, including a martial art teaching contract for Wu Ta-kuei from the [[Kowloon]] [[police]].
