'''Sea turtles''' (superfamily '''Chelonioidea''') are marine [[reptile]]s that inhabit all of the world's oceans except the [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]].

==Distribution==
The [[Taxonomic rank|superfamily]] Chelonioidea has a world-wide distribution; sea turtles can be found in all oceans except for the polar regions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Some species travel between oceans. The [[flatback sea turtle]] is found solely on the northern coast of [[Australia]].

==Biology==
===Respiration===
[[Image:Chelonia mydas got to the surface to breath.jpg|250px|thumb|left|A Green sea turtle breaks the surface to breathe.]]
Sea turtles are almost always submerged in water, and, therefore, have developed an [[anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] system of respiration. Although all sea turtles breathe air, under dire circumstances they may divert to anaerobic respiration for long periods of time. When surfacing to breathe, a sea turtle can quickly refill its lungs with a single explosive exhalation and rapid inhalation. Their large lungs have adapted to permit rapid exchange of oxygen and to avoid trapping gases during deep dives. However, sea turtles must emerge while breeding, given the extra level of activity.

According to [[SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment]], a lifespan of 80 years is feasible for sea turtles.<ref>{{Cite web

It takes decades for sea turtles to reach sexual maturity. After mating at sea, adult female sea turtles return to land to nest at night. Different species of sea turtles exhibit various levels of [[philopatry]]. In the extreme case, females return to the beach where they hatched. This can take place every two to four years in maturity. They make from one to eight nests per season.

The mature nesting female hauls herself onto the beach, nearly always at night, and finds suitable sand on which to create a nest. Using her hind flippers, she digs a circular hole {{convert|40|to|50|cm|in}} deep. After the hole is dug, the female then starts filling the nest with a clutch of soft-shelled eggs one by one until she has deposited around 50 to 200 eggs, depending on the species. Some species have been reported to lay 250 eggs, such as the hawksbill. After laying, she re-fills the nest with sand, re-sculpting and smoothing the surface until it is relatively undetectable visually. The whole process takes thirty to sixty minutes. She then returns to the ocean, leaving the eggs untended.<ref name="Audubon1897">{{cite book | last =Audubon | first =Maria R. | authorlink =Maria Audubon | title =Audubon and His Journals: Dover Publications Reprint | publisher =Scribner's Sons | date =1897/1986 | location =New York | pages = 373<U+2013>375| url = | isbn = 978-0486251448}}</ref>

The hatchling's gender depends on the sand temperature. Lighter sands maintain higher temperatures, which decreases incubation time and results in more female hatchlings.

Incubation takes about two months. The eggs in one nest hatch together over a very short period of time. When ready, hatchlings tear their shells apart with their snout and dig through the sand. Again, this usually takes place at night, when predators such as seagulls cannot fly. Once they reach the surface, they instinctively head towards the sea. If, as happens on rare occasions, hatching takes place during daylight, only a very small proportion of each hatch (usually 0.01%) succeed, because local [[opportunist predator]]s, such as the common [[seagull]], gorge on the new sea turtles. Thus there is an obvious evolutionary drive to hatch at night, when survival rates on the beach are much higher. 

The hatchlings then proceed into the ocean, where a variety of marine predators await them. In 1987, Carr discovered that the young of ''[[Chelonia mydas]]'' and ''[[Caretta caretta]]'' spent a great deal of their [[pelagic]] lives in floating [[sargassum]] beds, where there are thick mats of unanchored [[seaweed]]. Within these beds, they found ample shelter and food. In the absence of sargassum beds, sea turtle young feed in the vicinity of [[upwelling]] "fronts".<ref name="PelagicDev">{{cite journal | last =Carr | first =Archie | authorlink =Archie Carr | title =New Perspectives on the Pelagic Stage of Sea Turtle Development | journal =Conservation Biology | volume =1 | issue =2 | pages =103<U+2013>121 | publisher =Blackwell Publishing | url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0888-8892%28198708%291%3A2%3C103%3ANPOTPS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-C | doi = 10.1111/j.1523-1739.1987.tb00020.x| id = | accessdate = 15 February 2007 | month =August | year =1987 }}</ref> In 2007, Reich determined that [[green sea turtle]] hatchlings spend the first three to five years of their lives in [[pelagic]] waters.

Instead of nesting individually like the other species, Ridley sea turtles come ashore en masse, known as an "arribada" (arrival). With the Kemp's ridley sea turtles this occurs during the day.

===Salt gland===
Sea turtles possess a salt excretory gland at the corner of the eye, in the nostrils, or in the tongue, depending on the species; chelonian salt glands are found in the corner of the eyes in leatherback sea turtles. Due to the iso-osmotic makeup of jellyfish and the other gelatinous prey upon which sea turtles subsist, sea turtle diets are high in salt; chelonian salt gland excretions are almost entirely composed of sodium chloride 1500-1800 mosmoll-1 (Marshall and Cooper, 1988; Nicolson and Lutz, 1989; Reina and Cooper, 2000).

Sea turtles enjoy immunity from the sting of the deadly [[box jellyfish]] and regularly eat them, helping keep tropical beaches safe for humans.

Sea turtles, especially green sea turtles, are one of the few animals that eat sea grass. Sea grass needs to be constantly cut short to help it grow across the sea floor. Sea turtles act as grazing animals that cut the grass short and help maintain the health of the sea grass beds. Sea grass beds provide breeding and developmental grounds for numerous species of fish, shellfish and crustaceans. Without sea grass beds, many marine species humans harvest would be lost, as would the lower levels of the food chain. The reactions could result in many more marine species eventually becoming endangered or extinct.<ref name="cccturtle.org">http://cccturtle.org/seaturtleinformation.php?page=whycareaboutseaturtles</ref> 

Beaches and dune systems do not get many nutrients. Sea turtles use beaches and the lower dunes to nest and lay their eggs. Sea turtles lay around 100 eggs in a nest and lay between 3 and 7 nests during the summer nesting season. Along a 20-mile stretch of beach on the east coast of Florida sea turtles lay over 150,000&nbsp;lbs of eggs in the sand. Dune vegetation is able to grow and become stronger with the presence of nutrients from sea turtle eggs, unhatched nests, eggs and trapped hatchlings. As the dune vegetation grows stronger and healthier, the health of the entire beach/dune ecosystem becomes better. Stronger vegetation and root systems helps to hold the sand in the dunes and helps protect the beach from erosion.<ref name="cccturtle.org"/> 

Beach towns, such as Tortuguero, Costa Rica, have transitioned from a tourism industry that made profits from selling sea turtle meat and shells to an ecotourism-based economy.  Tortuguero is considered to be the founding location of sea turtle conservation. In the 1960s the cultural demand for sea turtle meat, shells, and eggs were quickly killing once abundant sea turtle populations that nested on the beach. The Caribbean Conservation Corporation began working with villagers to promote ecotourism as a permanent substitute to sea turtle hunting. Sea turtle nesting grounds became sustainable. Since the creation of a sea turtle, ecotourism-based economy, Tortugero annually houses thousands of tourists who visit the protected 22-mile beach that hosts sea turtle walks and nesting grounds.<ref>http://www.tortugueroinfo.com/usa/sea_turtles_tortuguero.htm</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/25/travel/turtle-watch-in-costa-rica.html?scp=3&sq=costa%20rica,%20sea%20turtle&st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Turtle Watch in Costa Rica | first=John R. | last=Alden | date=25 October 1998}}</ref>

Sea turtles must surface to breathe. Caught in a fisherman's net, they are unable to surface and thus suffocate.

However, some relatively inexpensive changes to fishing techniques, such as slightly larger hooks and traps from which sea turtles can escape, can dramatically cut the mortality rate.<ref>[http://www.seaturtle.org/mtn/archives/mtn113/mtn113p13.shtml Irene Kinan . 2006.

Another danger comes from [[marine debris]], especially from [[Ghost net|abandoned fishing nets]] in which they can become entangled.

Beach development is another area which threatens sea turtles. Since many sea turtles return to the same beach each time to nest, development can disrupt the cycle. There has been a movement to protect these areas, in some cases by special police. In some areas, such as the east coast of [[Florida]], conservationists dig up sea turtle eggs and relocate them to fenced nurseries to protect them from beach traffic.

Since hatchlings find their way to the ocean by crawling towards the brightest horizon, they can become disoriented on developed stretches of coastline. Lighting restrictions can prevent lights from shining on the beach and confusing hatchlings. Sea turtle-safe lighting uses red or amber LED light, invisible to sea turtles, in place of white light.

Another major threat to sea turtles is black-market trade in eggs and meat. This is a problem throughout the world, but especially a concern in the [[Philippines]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]] and the coastal nations of [[Latin America]]. Estimates reach as high as 35,000 sea turtles killed a year in [[Mexico]] and the same number in [[Nicaragua]]. Conservationists in Mexico and the United States have launched "Don't Eat Sea Turtle" campaigns in order to reduce this trade in sea turtle products. These campaigns have involved figures such as [[Dorismar]], [[Los Tigres del Norte]] and [[Man<U+00E1>]]. Sea turtles are often consumed during the Catholic season of Lent, even though they are reptiles, not fish. Consequently, conservation organizations have written letters to the Pope asking that he declare sea turtles meat.{{citation}}

Climate change may also cause a threat to sea turtles. Since sand temperature at nesting beaches defines the sex of a sea turtle while developing in the egg, there is concern that rising temperatures may produce too many females. However, more research is needed to understand how climate change might affect sea turtle gender distribution and what other possible threats it may pose.<ref>{{Cite journal

==Fragile ecosystems==
[[Image:Sea turtles on beach in hawaii.jpg|thumb|left|Sea turtles on a beach in [[Hawaii]]]]

Sea turtles play key roles in two ecosystem types that are critical to them as well as to humans<U+2014>oceans and beaches/dunes. In the oceans, for example, sea turtles, especially green sea turtles, are one of very few creatures (manatees are another) that eat the [[sea grass]] that grows on the sea floor. Sea grass must be kept short to remain healthy, and beds of healthy sea grass are essential breeding and development areas for many species of fish and other marine life. A decline or loss of sea grass beds would damage these populations, triggering a chain reaction and negatively impacting marine and human life.

Beaches and dunes form a fragile ecosystem that depends on vegetation to protect against erosion. Eggs, hatched or unhatched, and hatchlings that fail to make it into the ocean are nutrient sources for dune vegetation {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. Every year, sea turtles lay countless eggs on beaches. Along one twenty-mile (32&nbsp;km) stretch of beach in Florida alone, for example, more than 150,000 pounds of eggs are laid each year.

It is the largest sea turtle, measuring {{convert|6|to|7|ft|m}} in length at maturity, and {{convert|3|to|5|ft|m}} in width, weighing up to {{convert|1300|lb|kg}}. Other species are smaller, being mostly {{convert|2|to|4|ft|m}} and proportionally narrower.<ref name="WWFSeaturtles">{{cite web | title =WWF - Marine Turtles | work =Species Factsheets | publisher =World Wide Fund for Nature | date =4 May 2007 | url =http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/what_we_do/species/about_species/species_factsheets/marine_turtles/index.cfm | accessdate =13 September 2007 }}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=October 2008}}

Sea turtles constitute a single radiation that became distinct from all other turtles at least 110 million years ago.

From [http://www.seaturtlestatus.org/Main/Report/SwotReportDetail.aspx?page=swot_report#intro ''SWOT Report'', vol. 1]:
* '''Family Cheloniida'''
** ''[[Chelonia mydas]]'' or [[green sea turtle]]
** ''[[Eretmochelys imbricata]]'' or [[hawksbill sea turtle]]
** ''[[Natator depressus]]'' or [[flatback sea turtle]]
** ''[[Caretta caretta]]'' or [[Loggerhead sea turtle]]
** ''[[Lepidochelys kempii]]'' or [[Kemp's ridley sea turtle]]
** ''[[Lepidochelys olivacea]]'' or [[olive ridley sea turtle]]
* '''Family Dermochelyidae'''
** ''[[Dermochelys coriacea]]'' or [[leatherback sea turtle]]

In the strictest sense (''[[sensu stricto]]''), Cheloniidae includes only living sea turtles and a few more recently extinct species. The leatherback sea turtle is placed within Cheloniidae in the [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] Carretini, along with the Ridley sea turtles.
