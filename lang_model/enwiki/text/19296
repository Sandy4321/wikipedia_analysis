At the time that WGN Program Director Dan Fabian requested the new song, "It<U+2019>s a Beautiful Day for a Ball Game" by The Harry Simeone Songsters was the theme song. He had been motivated by Cubs manager [[Dallas Green]]'s effort to change the team spirit. Goodman happened to be in town for a WGN radio [[talk show]] and was receptive to the idea of writing the team a new song.<ref name="WRaVMtutbiCaGCGtmp" />

[[Image:20080920 Cubs Win Flag at Ohio St. Beach.JPG|left|thumb|"Go, Cubs, Go" and the [[Cubs Win flag]] symbolize Cubs' victories.]]
"Go, Cubs, Go" first became popular during {{by|1984}} when the Cubs won the 1984 [[National League East]] Division Championship and subsequently lost in the [[1984 National League Championship Series]]. That season (and for several afterwards) it was the official team song.<ref name="GCG" /> It was first aired on WGN on [[Opening Day]] and played every gameday for the rest of the season.<ref name="WRaVMtutbiCaGCGtmp" /> During that season, Goodman lost his sixteen-year battle with [[leukemia]] four days before the Cubs clinched the division title.<ref name="GCG" /><ref name="GCGasiC" /> In the next three years, 60,000 copies of the song were sold with proceeds going to charity.<ref name="GCGCablfsmac" /> Some [[1984 Chicago Cubs season|1984 Cubs]] players can be heard performing the [[refrain]].<ref name="GCGCablfsmac" />

In 1987, the song gave way to [[The Beach Boys]]' "Here Come the Cubs".<ref name="GCGasiC" /> Later team songs included songs such as [[Kool & the Gang]]'s "[[Celebration (song)|Celebration]]" and [[KC and the Sunshine Band]]'s "[[Get Down Tonight]]".<ref name="SMaCAWtC" /><ref name="GCGasiC" /> The song was eventually included on Goodman's album ''No Big Surprise: Anthology'', which was released on September 15, 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Big-Surprise-Anthology-Steve-Goodman/dp/B000000DM7/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1221974610&sr=8-1|title=No Big Surprise: Anthology|accessdate=2008-09-21|date=2008|publisher=[[Amazon.com, Inc.]]}}</ref>

==Modern resurgence==

In the first week of October 2007, it was the most popular [[folk music]] [[Digital distribution|digital download]] on [[iTunes Store|iTunes]].<ref name="GCGasiC" /> During that season, it was known as the unofficial Chicago Cubs victory song and it was played at Wrigley Field after each Cubs victory.<ref name="GCGasiC" /><ref name="GCG" /> There were 44 such victories during the 2007 regular season.<ref name="GCGasiC" /> On October 5, 2007, [[Lieutenant Governor of Illinois|Illinois Lieutenant Governor]] [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]] declared the day "Steve Goodman Day" throughout the state.<ref name="GCG" />.

[[Image:Take Me Out To A Cubs Game.jpg|thumb|left|The song was included in a 2008 [[Major League Baseball|MLB]]-licensed Cubs songs and sounds album celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Cubs' [[1908 World Series]] victory.]]
On August 1, 2008, WGN Radio and Vibes Media released a [[ringtone]] version of the song for purchase by [[Text messaging|text message]] for a cost of [[US$]]2.99.

The album is a 17-song album with a total run time of 55 minutes and 35 seconds that includes the September 21, 1997 [[Harry Caray]] performance of "[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]", which was his last.  The album was produced in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Cubs [[1908 World Series]] victory and contains sounds and songs of the Cubs and Wrigley Field.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Take-Out-Cubs-Game-Music/dp/B001EVMRDM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=apparel&qid=1223602728&sr=8-1|title='Take Me Out To A Cubs Game' Music CD|accessdate=2008-10-10|date=2008|publisher=[[Amazon.com, Inc.]]}}</ref><ref name="TMOTACGC">{{cite web|url=http://cubhub.net/Cubs-Music/|title=Take Me Out To A Cubs Game  CD|accessdate=2008-10-10|date=2008|publisher=CubHub.net}}</ref>  The album is an officially licensed [[Major League Baseball]] music CD.<ref name="TMOTACGC" />  Neither of Goodman's other notable songs about the Cubs ("A Dying Cub Fan's Last Request" or "When the Cubs Go Marching In") was included on the album.

Also in 2008, the song was released by [[Manic Sewing Circle]]. It was performed for the first time live on WGN-TV at the Skybox on Sheffield, located directly across from [[Wrigley Field]] on opening day 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV7FPCu1PgI|title=Manic Sewing Circle on YouTube|accessdate=2009-03-05|date=2009|publisher=YouTube.com}}</ref> Their [[cover version]] of the song was released with proceeds going to official charities of the [[Chicago Cubs]] and WGN-Radio:  Cubs Care and Neediest Kids Fund.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdbaby.com/cd/manicsewing3|title=Manic Sewing Circle|accessdate=2008-10-10|date=2008|publisher=CDBaby.com}}</ref> The Manic Sewing Circle version of the song is also available on iTunes by digital download,<ref name="TMOTACGC" /> and they publicized this version throughout Chicago.<ref name="MSCpGCG" /> <!--The following was unsourced: According to the band, they had less than 12 hours to construct and rehearse the song before performing it live for the time first on WGN-TV. The final product is ultimately what is heard on the [[iTunes]] digital download; not a single note or refrain changed from the short rehearsal. -->Although the original Goodman version of the song is 2:51, the new Manic Sewing Circle version is only 2:23 long.

In September 2008, prompted by the Cubs' 2008 season and a piece by Mike Leonard on the [[NBC]] ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'' about Steve Goodman, [[Red Pajamas Records]] issued a 4-cut EP titled ''The Baseball Singles'' with Goodman's performances of "Go Cubs Go", "A Dying Cub Fan's Last Request", "When The Cubs Go Marching In", and "[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]".<ref>
