The '''[[National Hockey League]]''' presents numerous annual '''awards''' and trophies to recognize its teams and players.  The oldest, and most recognizable, is the [[Stanley Cup]].  First awarded in 1893, the Stanley Cup is awarded to the NHL's playoff champion.  The Stanley Cup is the third trophy to be used as the league's championship, as for the first nine years of the NHL's existence, it remained a multi-league challenge cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/silver_splashstanleycup.htm|title=Stanley Cup history|work=legendsofhockey.net|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=2007-08-19}}</ref> 
==History==
The NHL's first championship trophy was the [[O'Brien Trophy]], which was created by the [[National Hockey Association]] in 1910 and was acquired by the NHL in 1918, after which it was awarded to the playoff champion until 1923.<ref name="obrien">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/silver_splashobrien.htm|title=O'Brien Trophy|work=legendsofhockey.net|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=2007-08-18}}</ref> The O'Brien Trophy was retired in favour of the [[Prince of Wales Trophy]] in 1924, which became the league's championship until the demise of the [[Western Canada Hockey League|Western Hockey League]] following the 1926 season, leaving the Stanley Cup exclusively in the hands of the National Hockey League.

The Prince of Wales Trophy remains an active award.  It is presently awarded to the playoff champion of the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]], while the [[Clarence S. Campbell Bowl]], created in 1967, is currently awarded to the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] champion.  The youngest team trophy is the [[Presidents' Trophy]], which has been awarded to the NHL's regular season champion since 1986.

The first individual trophy was the [[Hart Memorial Trophy|Hart Trophy]], first awarded in 1924 to the league's most valuable player.  The [[Lady Byng Trophy]] followed a year later, awarded to the most gentlemanly player in the league.  Two years later, the [[Vezina Trophy]] was created for the NHL's top goaltender.  The [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] was first awarded to the NHL's playoff most valuable player in 1965.  Presently, the NHL has 17 annual individual trophies and awards, the most recently created being the [[Mark Messier Leadership Award]], first awarded in 2007.
