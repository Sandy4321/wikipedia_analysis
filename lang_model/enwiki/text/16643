'''HMS ''Blake'' (C99)''' was a [[guided missile cruiser]] of the [[Tiger class cruiser|''Tiger'' class]] of the Royal Navy, the last of the Royal Navy cruisers. She was named after [[Admiral Robert Blake]], a 17th century admiral who was the "Father of the Royal Navy". She was ordered in 1942 as one of the [[Minotaur class cruiser (1943)|''Minotaur'' class]] of [[light cruiser]]s. They had a low construction priority due to more pressing requirements for other ship types during [[World War II]], particularly anti-submarine craft. ''Blake'' was laid down in 1942. In 1944, ''Blake'' was renamed ''Tiger'', then ''Blake'' again in 1945, the year she was launched partially constructed at the [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company]] at [[Govan]], by Lady Jean Blake, wife of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Geoffrey Blake (admiral)|Sir Geoffrey Blake]]. Construction of ''Blake'' was suspended in 1946 and she was laid up at [[Gareloch]]. 

==Construction and commissioning==
In 1954, construction of ''Blake'' resumed, but to a new design. The new design was approved in 1951, but construction did not resume until 1954. She would have fully-automatic 6&nbsp;inch guns in twin high-angle mounts with each gun capable of shooting 20 rounds per minute, and a secondary battery of fully-automatic 3&nbsp;inch guns which delivered 90 rounds per minute per gun. She would have no lighter [[anti-aircraft]] armament or [[torpedo tube]]s. [[Air conditioning]] was fitted throughout the ship, and a 200-line automatic [[telephone]] exchange was installed. Each 6&nbsp;inch and 3&nbsp;inch mounting had its own director, linked to a dedicated radar on the director. On 18 March 1961, ''Blake'' finally commissioned into the Royal Navy, the last cruiser to do so. Just two years later, she was placed in reserve.  

==Conversion==
From 1965 to 1969, she underwent a major conversion to become a [[Helicopter and Commando Cruiser]]. This reconstruction included replacing the after 6 inch mount and 3 inch mounts with a flight deck and hangar. She also had new [[radar]]s and taller funnels. She had excellent [[command, control, and communications]] facilities installed, and found use as a [[flagship]] to task groups. The refit was very expensive; during the conversion a major fire broke out causing considerable damage and raising the costs still further. There were concerns that the money used to convert ''Blake'', and her sister ship [[HMS Tiger (C20)|''Tiger'']] to helicopter cruisers drained much needed resources better used elsewhere. In 1969 ''Blake'' deployed to [[Gibraltar]] along with other Royal Navy units in order to <U+2018>fly the flag<U+2019> in response to Spanish hostility following the closure of the Gibraltar-Spain border by [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]]. Also in 1969 a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Harrier Jump Jet|Harrier jet]] landed on ''Blake''. In 1971, she was present during the emotional [[Malta#Independence|withdrawal from Malta]], supporting the commando carrier [[HMS Bulwark (R08)|HMS ''Bulwark'']], and in 1977 took part in the [[Fleet Review]] of the Royal Navy during the [[Silver Jubilee]] celebrations for [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], which took place off [[Spithead]], site of many Fleet Reviews.

==Decommissioning==
The cruiser was host to the [[Westland Wessex]] HAS MK3 [[helicopter]]s of [[820 Naval Air Squadron]] from 1969 and later on the [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter until ''Blake'' was withdrawn from service in 1979, when the ship became the last ship in the Royal Navy to fire a six-inch gun. Her large crew made her an expensive ship to operate and maintain. ''Blake'' was refitted in 1980, and due to a defence manpower drawdown that resulted in manpower shortages, became part of the [[Standby Squadron]] in [[Chatham Dockyard|HMNB Chatham]]. The advent of the [[Falklands War]] led to a rapid ship survey and work was begun to recommission her and sister ship ''Tiger'' for service in the conflict, but work was stopped on both in late May when it was clear neither could be ready in time to deploy.  She was sold for scrap on 25 August 1982 to Shipbreaking (Queenborough) Ltd for <U+00A3>210,000. The ship's bell of the ''Blake'' has been preserved and is on display in [[Saint Mary's Church]], [[Bridgwater]].  She was the last cruiser serving with the Royal Navy upon her decommissioning.  On 29 October 1982 she was towed from Chatham for Cairnryan, arriving 7 November 1982.
