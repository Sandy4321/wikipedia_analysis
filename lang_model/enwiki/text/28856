'''''Age of Empires III''''' (also called '''''AoE III''''', or simply '''''Age 3''''') is a [[real-time strategy|real-time strategy (RTS)]] game developed by [[Ensemble Studios]] and published by [[Microsoft Game Studios]]. Released on [[October 18]], [[2005]] in [[North America]], and on [[November 4]] of the same year in [[Europe]], it is the third title of the ''[[Age of Empires|Age of Empires series]]'', and the sequel to ''[[Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings]]''. The game portrays the [[European colonization of the Americas]], between approximately [[Anno Domini|AD]] 1500 and 1850. Eight European civilizations are playable.

''Age of Empires III'' has made a number of innovations in the series, as well as the RTS genre, in particular with the addition of the Home City, which combines real-time strategy and [[Role-playing game|role-playing game (RPG)]] features. Two [[expansion pack]]s were released: the first, ''[[Age of Empires III: The War Chiefs]]'', was released on [[October 17]], [[2006]], and introduced three [[Native North American]] civilizations; the second, ''[[Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties]]'', was released on [[October 23]], [[2007]], and included three [[Asia]]n civilizations.

''Age of Empires III'' has sold over 2 million copies, as of May, 2008. As well as achieving favorable [[review]]s, it has received a number of awards, including [[GameSpy]]'s "Best RTS game of 2005", and was one of the [[best-selling games]] of 2005.<ref name="Two million copies">{{cite web | url = http://www.agecommunity.com/press.aspx?PressReleaseID=161 | title = Two million copies sold | accessdate = 2007-10-14 | date = [[2007-05-18]] | publisher = Age Community}}</ref> In 2007, ''Age of Empires III'' was the seventh best-selling computer game, with over 313,000 copies sold.<ref name="2007 sales">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/news/npd-issues-corrected-top-10-pc-games-of-2007/19212/?biz=1 | title = 2007 sales figures | date = [[2008-01-25]] | accessdate = 2008-01-31 | publisher = GameDaily}}</ref>

== Synopsis ==
''Age of Empires III'' is mostly set in the [[New World]] during the [[colonial era]], between approximately [[Anno Domini|AD]] 1421 and 1850.<ref name="Amazon">{{cite web|title=Age of Empires III|author=Harrison Dent|publisher=Amazon|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Age-of-Empires-III-PC/dp/B0009XH4CU/ref=sr_1_1/202-7175925-8189400?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1177275414&sr=1-1|accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref> In the style of previous titles of the series and genre, the game requires the player to develop a [[Europe]]an nation's colony from a basic settlement to an empire, progressing through "Ages"&mdash;stages of technological development&mdash;and destroying the enemy base(s). There are two main branches to gameplay: the economy, characterized by the collection of resources, and production of civilian units<U+2014>which usually gather resources; and the military which involves the production of military units, and the conflicts between armies of rival teams or factions.<ref name="Destineer_Mac">{{cite web|title=Macsoft announces Age of Empires III for Macintosh|publisher=Destineer Studios|url=http://www.destineerstudios.com/destineer/press/press_releases/aoe3_announce.html|accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref>

A match consists of a conflict between two or more teams that race to develop a powerful nation by creating and upgrading units and buildings, with one eventually defeating the other through combat or resignation; the game ends when there is only one player or team left [[Last man standing (gaming)|standing]] on the map. Along with these typical [[Real-time strategy|RTS]] features, a new addition is that the player may also ship troops, buildings, [[Game mechanic#Resource management|resources]], and even improvements&mdash;such as military or economic bonuses&mdash;to aid them.<ref name="GameSpy_Home_City">{{cite web|title=Age of Empires III - Building the Home City|author=Allen Rausch|publisher=GameSpy|url=http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/age-of-empires-iii/645630p1.html|accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref>

There are three modes of game play: story-based campaigns, single player skirmishes (conflicts between teams), and online [[multiplayer]] skirmishes.<ref>Age of Empires III Manual, pp. 31-32 - 'Ways to Play Age of Empires III'.</ref>

Single player skirmishes take place between human players and [[artificial intelligence|computer personalities]], conforming to rules that are set up before the game. The map, [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] skill level, and each player's resource gathering speed may be modified.

=== Multiplayer ===
Multiplayer matches can be played through the bundled [[Ensemble Studios|Ensemble Studios Online (ESO)]] application or via a direct LAN or IP connection.

''Age of Empires III'' includes a free [[Multiplayer game|multiplayer]] account on Ensemble Studios Online. Similar in function to [[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s [[Battle.net]], ESO allows players to play matches and chat with other players. Each copy of the game supports one ESO account.

On ESO, the player may establish [[Age of Empires III#Home cities|Home Cities]], as in single player, and is given the default military rank of Conscript. As the player defeats others in multiplayer battles, they can be [[promotion (rank)|promoted]], gradually earning higher ranks, until the highest, Field Marshal, is achieved. This ranking system is based on a "power rating" system<ref name="Power Rating">{{cite web|title=Power Rating - How it Works |publisher=Ensemble Studios|url=https://forum.agecommunity.com/forums/permalink/157093/157093/ShowThread.aspx#157093|accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref> that determines rank based on the difficulty of matches and activity in the game; for instance, more points are awarded for beating a player with a higher-level Home City than the victor. Likewise, more points are deducted for losing to a player with a lower rank.

ESO also supports the play of custom maps, originating several diverse game types such as "cats v.s. mice", "fort wars", "gold rush", "pirates of the Caribbean", etc.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

=== Setting ===
Matches are fought on maps based on existing locations, and can be selected from a list of "[[Random seed|seeded]]" or predefined maps. Players also have the option of playing on an "Unknown" map, which is a [[Random|random-generated]] map. Customisable [[variable]]s mean that each seeded map is different.

Each map has features which are always present<U+2014>such as location and type of Trade Posts<U+2014>and characteristics, such as a paucity of trees. [[Treasure]]s are scattered throughout the map, and may be claimed for various awards<U+2014>such as a cache of resources. The resources available include [[Food]], [[Wood]], and [[Coin]]; Wood may only be gathered from trees, but Food and Coin have various sources. Grazing animals<U+2014>[[cow]]s, [[llama]]s, and [[sheep]]<U+2014> may be herded across the map and fatten up over time until they reach a maximum amount of Food; it is therefore more [[profit]]able to fatten them, though they may be slaughtered beforehand. Wild game may be hunted and gathered as Food. The oceans contain [[fish]], which may be collected for Food, and [[whale]]s, which can be [[whaling|whaled]] as an inexhaustible source of Coin. Other infinite sources of resources include the [[Plantation]],<U+2014>from which villagers can gather Coin<U+2014> the [[mill (grinding)|Mill]],<U+2014>similar to the plantation, but is a source of Food rather than Coin<U+2014> Trading Posts provide a source of Food, Wood, Coin or Experience, the [[Bank]],<U+2014> which gradually feeds coin without villagers (only available to the [[the Netherlands|Dutch]])<U+2014> and [[factory|factories]], which produce a resource of the player's choice, or [[artillery|Heavy artillery]].

Custom-made maps are also playable, in both single player and multiplayer. Ensemble Studios released holiday-related maps during their respective seasons,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agecommunity.com/all_downloads_xp.aspx|title=Festive Maps|publisher=Age Community|accessdate=2007-01-22}}</ref> and fan websites have free [[download]]able player-made custom scenarios.

== Gameplay ==
Players begin with a constructed town center, an explorer and several settlers. The exact terrain of the map, position of opponents, native tribes and trade posts is obscured. Teammates, if any, are exposed. Players explore the map and begin gathering resources, Food, Coin or Wood which are spent to build additional units and buildings and to research upgraded technologies. Actions such as training units, constructing buildings, killing enemy units etc earn the player experience points. At certain experience point thresholds, players earn shipment cards that may be turned in for shipments from the players Home City. The game progresses like any RTS until one side resigns or is eliminated.

=== Ages ===
As in most [[Real-time strategy|RTS]] games, the player can advance through technological phases, which provide access to greater improvements, units, and buildings. In ''Age of Empires III'', these phases are called "Ages", and represent historical time periods. They are: the [[Age of Discovery|Discovery Age]], which represents the discovery and exploration of the Americas by Europeans and allows the player to explore and develop their economy; the [[European colonization of the Americas|Colonial Age]], which represents the European Expansion into the "New World" and unlocks early military units; the [[Fortification|Fortress Age]], which represents the fortification of the European colonies, unlocks forts, and allows the player to have a more complete military; the [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial Age]], which triggers a strong economy, due in part to factories<U+2014>advanced buildings that produce resources or artillery<U+2014>and unlocks all units and cards; and the [[New Imperialism|Imperial Age]], which unlocks all buildings and upgrades. All Ages cost food and coin to advance to, but the only one that doesn't is the &mdash;the Colonial Age&mdash;which costs only food.  The price of age advancement is incremental, but doesn't vary between civilization.

Similar to the ''[[Age of Mythology]]'' minor gods system,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/games/ageofmythology/greek_civs.aspx | title=Minor Gods in [[Age of Mythology]] |accessdate=2007-02-05 | publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref> ''Age of Empires III'' utilizes a "''Politician System''" as a method of granting bonuses on a successful advancement to another age. When a player chooses to advance to the next age, they are given the choice of two or more "Politicians" that will provide the player with a different bonus upon choosing them. The Politician is given a generalized title from the period that usually reflects the bonus that it gives: for example, "The Naturalist" gives the player four cows. As the player's Home City increases in level, more politicians are unlocked,&mdash;at a rate of one for every ten Home City levels&mdash;up to level 60.

=== Civilizations ===
''Age of Empires III'' allows the player to play as eight different [[civilization]]s:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ageofempires3.com/Age3/Civilizations/Default.aspx|title=Civilizations|publisher=Ensemble Studios|accessdate=2006-11-26}}</ref> [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], [[British Empire|British]], [[French colonial empire|French]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]], [[German colonial empire|German]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], in increasing order of difficulty.<ref>Age of Empires III Manual, p. 21 - 'Choosing a civilization'.</ref> Each of the eight civilizations has its own strengths and weaknesses and unique units available only to that civilization. Specific units for each civilization are designated Royal Guard units, receiving greater bonuses on the Guard upgrade in the Industrial Age, but at an increased price. The player can change the name of their Home City, the Explorer name, and is given a pre-named leader from part of the period (for example [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] for the French and [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] for the Ottoman Empire). Each civilization has unique shipments to aid its economy and military (for example, Germans have the only mercenary card available in the Colonial Age).

| The '''Spanish''' have good hand infantry and cavalry available, and are flexible early in the game due to their faster Home City shipments. The Spanish explorer can train [[War Dog]]s since the Discovery Age, when soldiers aren't buildable. Their unique units are the [[Rodelero]], [[Lancer]] and [[Missionary]]. Their Royal Guards are the Espada [[Rodelero]], Garrochista [[Lancer]] and [[Tercio]] [[Pikeman]].

This gives them the capacity to overwhelm other players with their large armies, which are supplemented by the low cost of their military and, for the most basic units, almost instant build time. Their unique units are the [[Strelet]], [[Cossack]] and [[Oprichnik]]. Their Royal Guards are the [[Tartar]] [[Horse Archer|Cavalry Archer]] and Pavlov [[Grenadier]].

Their military develops steadily because [[Uhlan]] cavalry are given as a bonus along with most shipments. Also, the Germans can ship [[mercenaries]] sooner and in larger numbers than any other civilization. Their unique units are the [[Doppelsoldner]], [[Uhlan]], [[War Wagon]] and [[Conestoga wagon#Prairie Schooners|Settler Wagon]]. Their Royal Guards are the [[Prussia|Prussian]] [[Needle gun|Needle Gunner]] Skirmisher and [[Czapka]] [[Uhlan]].

| The '''Ottoman''' economy is slow but constant, due to the fact that settlers are continually produced automatically at no cost but have the disadvantage of having limited settler production. The Ottoman military makes heavy use of artillery units, many of them unique; they train the [[Great Turkish Bombard|Great Bombard]], the most powerful artillery unit in the game. The Ottomans lack light infantry: the only infantry they are able to train is the [[Janissary]], a more powerful type of [[musketeer]]. Their unique units are the [[Janissary]], [[Abus Gun]], [[Spahi]], [[Great Bombard]], [[Galley]] and [[Imam]]. Their Royal Guards are the [[Timariot|Gardener]] [[Hussar]] and Baratcu [[Grenadier]].

There are other civilizations playable via the campaign, which include the [[Knights Hospitaller|The Knights of St. John]], John Black's Mercenaries, and the Falcon Railroad Company ([[United States]])<ref name="IGN">{{cite web|title=Age of Empires III|author=Steve Butts|publisher=IGN|url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/658/658624p1.html|accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref> which are played as the Spanish, German and British civilizations, respectively, with slight modifications. Non-playable campaign civilizations include the [[piracy|Pirates]], the Circle of Ossus, and the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], although these civilizations are playable using the Scenario Editor.

Twelve different [[tribe]]s of Native Americans are in the game as well, but these are not in themselves playable factions. However, players can gain access to unique units and improvements by forming an [[military alliance|alliance]] with the tribes by building a [[trading post]] at their camps. Three of these tribes were made playable in the expansion pack ''[[Age of Empires III: The War Chiefs]]'': the [[Iroquois]], the [[Sioux]] and the [[Aztec]]s. These civilizations were removed as the smaller, alliance based tribes and were replaced by the [[Huron]], [[Cheyenne]], and the [[Zapotec]], respectively.<ref name="AOE3">{{cite web|title=Age of Empires III|publisher=Ensemble Studios|url=http://www.ageofempires3.com/|accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref>

=== Home cities ===
[[Image:AOE3-comparison-1.jpg|thumb|300px|Screen shot of the British ''Home City'' comparing low (left) and high (right) graphics quality settings within the game.]]

''Age of Empires III'' is the first game in the series to introduce the ''Home City Concept.''<ref name="AOE3_Home_Cities">{{cite web|title=Home Cities in Age of Empires III|publisher=Ensemble Studios|url=http://www.ageofempires3.com/age3/GameFeatures/HomeCity.aspx|accessdate=2007-04-23}}</ref>

The ''Home City'' functions as a second city, a powerhouse that is separated from the active game. It cannot be attacked or destroyed, although an Imperial Age upgrade called ''Blockade'' stops the player's opponents from receiving Home City shipments. Similar to a [[role-playing game]] character,<ref name="Inside_Mac">{{cite web|title=Age of Empires III|author=Michael Phillips|publisher=Inside Mac|url=http://www.insidemacgames.com/reviews/view.php?ID=793|accessdate=2007-04-23}}</ref> the Home City is persistent between games, meaning that upgrades gained through separate games can be applied and stay applied for as long as that particular city exists (cities only cease to exist when they are deleted by the player from the game menu). Multiple Home Cities can be created and maintained, although each Home City supports only one civilization.

The ''Home City'' is made up of five main buildings from which the player chooses their new shipment cards and customizations: The New World Trading Company, the Military Academy, the Cathedral, the Manufacturing Plant and the Harbor.<ref name="HG_Home_Cities">{{cite web|url=http://aoe3.heavengames.com/gameinfo/aoe3/homecities|title=Home Cities|publisher=Heaven Games|accessdate=2007-04-23}}</ref>

Players can also access the Home City during a match by clicking on the ''Home City'' button represented on the [[HUD (computer gaming)|HUD]] as the nation's [[flag]]. The Home City functions differently inside a game. Instead of customizing a Home City or choosing cards, a player can ship cards chosen before the game (and added to a deck).

During the course of a game, players gain XP (experience) by completing actions such as constructing buildings, training units, killing enemies, and collecting treasures. Whenever a certain amount of experience points are gained, the player can make use of a shipment from their respective Home City. Shipments slow down as the game goes on, since more XP is required with every consecutive shipment.

Players may gear their cards into three different combinations: [[Economic boom|Boom]] (economic combinations), [[Rush (computer and video games)|Rush]] (military combinations), or [[Turtle (game term)|Turtle]] (defensive combinations).<ref name="Game types">{{cite web|title=Basic Strategies|publisher=IGN|url=http://uk.guides.ign.com/guides/721644/page_2.html|accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref>

The first few cards chosen are automatically added to the player's portfolio, where it may be copied onto a deck for use in a game. Later in the game, cards have to be manually chosen because of the limit of cards in one deck. Most cards are available to all civilizations, but some are unique to one.

If the Home City being played has more than one deck, the player must select which to use when the first shipment is sent. During a game, players keep this initial deck; this feature encourages players to build decks that are customized for the map being played on, or that counter other civilizations. The decks start out supporting 20 cards, but can eventually grow to 25 as the Home City level increases.

Customizations to the Home City change the visual aspects of the city, but do not affect gameplay. In customizing the Home City, players can add unique non-playable characters to the city (for example, a fruit vendor or a musician), change and upgrade the color schemes of buildings, or place objects and decorations throughout the city. A player gains a ''customization'' whenever the city gains a level.

=== Units ===
[[Image:Age of empires 3 various pics full graphics.jpg|thumb|300px|Clockwise from top left: Warship, infantry in defensive formation, explorer and agricultural buildings.]]

The [[unit]]s of ''Age of Empires III'' are based, as in previous iterations of the game, around [[military]] classes of the historic [[Gunpowder warfare|time period]]. The player controls a variety of [[civilian]] and [[military]] units, and uses them to expand and develop their [[civilization]], as well as wage war against their opponents.

The base unit of a game is the ''[[Settler]]'' (villager). These [[civilian]] units are responsible for gathering resources (through [[hunting]], [[foraging]], [[logging|woodcutting]], [[mining]], and gathering from [[farm]]s, [[livestock]], and [[plantation]]s) and constructing buildings, in order to improve the [[economy]] of the civilization.

[[Military]] units are used for [[combat]] against other players. Infantry are the cheapest unit type and all are land based, using weapons ranging from [[club]]s to early [[rifle]]s. The heavier [[artillery#History|artillery]] classes also make use of ranged weapons, primarily [[cannon]] and [[mortar (weapon)#history|mortars]]; however, there is also artillery armed with [[grenade]]s. Mounted troops, are also present, and are armed with either hand weapons, such as [[sword]]s, or ranged weapons, such as [[pistol]]s. These units also have significant features, such as [[skirmishers]] which do bonus damage against infantry, and ranged cavalry does bonus damage against other cavalry.

A new unit introduced in ''Age of Empires III'' is the ''[[Explorer]]'', which is chiefly responsible for scouting and gathering treasure; it is also capable of building Trading Posts, and has a special attack, to be used at the players command. This unit cannot be killed, but can be rendered unconscious, to be revived when friendly units are within range; also, a ransom may be paid in order to have him reappear at his town center. Some shipment cards may increase the explorer<U+2019>s effectiveness in game play, for example by providing him with "war dogs" which can aid with scouting and combat.

In ''Age of Empires III'', [[ship]]s are available on some maps; this military class makes use of [[cannon]] or [[arrow|flaming arrows]]. Some seagoing units also have the capacity to collect resources, such as food and coin, while others can transport units. A few types can also create land-based units.

[[Mercenary|Mercenaries]], hired troops, may aid the player in their campaigns in the [[New World]]. Mercenaries are not trained like standard units; they are shipped from the Home City in exchange for high amounts of coin, so that only economically powerful players can employ them. Most are powerful, but hiring them does not provide experience points, so mercenaries cannot effectively replace the player's standard army, and can negatively affect a player's economy if used excessively.

In most cases, a selection of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American tribes]] populate game maps, and support their own brand of military units that can be trained once an alliance has been formed. Some native American military units use [[m<U+00EA>l<U+00E9>e]] weapons, a few use indigenous ranged weapons, such as [[archery|bows and arrows]] or [[atl-atl]]s, while still others adopt ranged European gunpowder weapons. These units usually pertain to the infantry or cavalry classes, but, on maps with water, canoes are also available to the player through the dock. The [[France|French]] have certain facilities with their relation to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|natives]], so such alliances are more effective.

The innovative [[hot air balloon]], which is used for scouting, can be sent using a card from the Home City, and being trained by the explorer. Balloons may be made as many times as necessary, but there is a timer, limiting when the next may be trained.

The number of units a player can control in a scenario is limited by a "population limit", a common [[Real-time strategy|RTS]] [[game mechanic]]. Each unit that is produced increases the population count to a maximum of 200. Basic units such as [[settler]]s and [[infantry]] count as 1, but others, including most cavalry and mercenary infantry count as 2. More powerful units, especially [[artillery]] or mercenary cavalry, can count for a population as high as 7. Native warriors, [[exploration|explorers]], tamed and grazing animals, [[hot air balloon]]s, and [[warship]]s do not count towards the population limit, but generally have a build limit, allowing the player to deploy only a certain number of those specific units at a time.

=== Buildings ===
Buildings play a major role in gameplay, they are used for training civilian and military units, researching improvements, supporting population, providing structural defense or as resource providers.

The buildings portrayed in ''Age of Empires III'' resemble the architectural design of that era. All of the games in the series share a number of buildings, including the Town Center and Docks. The appearance and attributes of a building change as the player advances through the Ages, and some civilizations have their own unique buildings. The appearance of these buildings depends on the civilization, since, for instance, the Russian buildings look different from the French buildings; even though the appearance of a type of building may vary, its purpose does not.

There are certain architectural styles present in the game; architectural styles determine the appearance of in-game buildings.<ref name="art">{{cite book| title=Art of Empires|editor=Bart Tiongson|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|origyear=2005}}</ref> Each civilization is automatically assigned its architectural style. These three architectural styles are: the Western European, which consists of classical styled wooden buildings and is shared by the [[Great Britain|British]], the [[France|French]] and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]; the Eastern European, which consists of quite precarious wooden and straw structures and is shared by the [[Germany|Germans]] and the [[Russia]]ns, and the Mediterranean, which consists of buildings apparently made of cement and/or dry brick and is shared by the [[Spain|Spanish]], the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]

=== Campaign ===
The story-based campaign mode consists of related scenarios with preset objectives, such as destroying a given building. In ''Age of Empires III'', the campaign follows the fictional Black family in a series of three "Acts", which divide the story arc into three generations.

Instead of playing as one of the standard civilizations, the player takes command of a special civilization that is linked to the character or period that each Act portrays.

==== Act I: Blood ====
Set in around the late 16th century, the first act of the single-player campaign begins with the player in the role of Morgan Black<ref name="Blood">{{cite web|title=Walkthrough - Act I: Blood|publisher=IGN|url=http://uk.guides.ign.com/guides/721644/page_11.html|accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref>&mdash;of the [[Knights of Saint John]]&mdash;defending the last stronghold on [[Malta]] from Sahin "The Falcon" of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (in a telling of the [[Great Siege of Malta]]). The player must light a signal fire to call in supporting [[cavalry]] led by Morgan's superior, Alain Magnan, who fends off the Turks. Morgan and Alain drive the Ottomans from Malta, and when they detonate Ottoman weapon caches in the nearby caves, they discover a hidden stone library telling the story of the "Lake of the Moon" and the secret society called the "Circle of Ossus" who seek it out. Morgan then sails to the New World, but lands in [[Cuba]] after a pirate attack. They find some navigation charts, land in [[Mexico]], destroy an Ottoman base there. But the Spanish commander Francisco Juan  Delgado de Leon captures Sahin and some other Turks. They defeat the Spanish, who are attacking the [[Aztecs]]. He then sails to [[Florida]], but is trapped in the Caribbean again and must earn Lizzie the Pirate's respect. Once in Florida, Morgan captures some Spanish treasure ships, and Sahin joins him, telling him that the Circle think the Lake of the Moon is the [[Fountain of Youth]]. Delgado and his army are destroyed. Since the Spanish have been wiped out from Mexico, Sahin is freed and is then captured by Morgan. Alain tells Morgan to execute him but Sahin and Lizzie convince Morgan that Alain was actually the Circle's leader, and they decide to destroy the Fountain of Youth to stop the Circle's plans for domination of the New World. They capture and retain an enormous stationary cannon called a Fixed Gun and use it and Lizzie's fire ships to down the Fountain. Alain Magnan attacks Morgan, however he dies in battle. Sahin returns to his country, and Lizzie leaves for the Caribbean (although it is hinted that she reunites with Morgan several years later, possibly starting the Black family line). Morgan is last seen wondering about the significance of the Fountain and whether he should drink its remaining water, although a very old man identical to Morgan appears in Act III, talking about The Circle (also when making a custom scenario, if a player places an old man on their side, and select it while playing, the character portrait is identical to Morgan including his hair being the same, and even wearing the same armour). During Act I, the player assumes command of the 'Knights of St. John', which resembles the Spanish civilization (even though the faction played is actually Maltese).

==== Act II: Ice ====
It is 1757,<ref name=Ice>{{cite web|title=Walkthrough - Act II: Ice|publisher=IGN|url=http://uk.guides.ign.com/guides/721644/page_14.html|accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref> and Morgan's grandson, John Black, and his Native friend Kanyenke are on their way to Brunswick, Black's uncle Stuart<U+2019>s colony, as he has called for help. After exchanging attacks with [[Cherokee]] raiders and war camps, they attempt to arrange a peace settlement. When they reach the village, they are attacked by the British who capture the town. While planning a counter attack, they discover that John's uncle Stuart has been kidnapped; John concludes that the Circle of Ossus has returned. Kanyenke realizes that his sister, Nonahkee is in danger, too; but he is stunned to discover, after saving the [[Iroquois]] village in New England that she called home, that she and John were secretly in love. Afterwards Kanyenke consents to their love and joins John in taking down the Circle. They fight with the [[France|French]] in the [[Seven Years' War]] and destroy a Circle base in the [[Great Lakes]]. Warwick, the Circle's leader, is revealed to have killed Stewart, and flees to the western mountains. John and Kanyenke follow him, first earning the respect of the [[Great Plains]] tribes by gaining lots of experience from good deeds, then destroying a fortified Circle base in the mountains. They soon discover that Warwick and his soldiers fled west, to act as a checkpoint for the Russian army, who plans to capture British and French colonies and towns while their soldiers are at war. With the help of miners, they were able to bring down large rock bridges to stop the Russian large cannons from getting through. In the end John is shown setting up some TNTs. Warwick and several Circle Soldiers approach him. Warwick attempts to kill John but when the Circle Soldiers shoot him, John dodges the bullets and jumps at Warwick, knocking him to the ground then running to the TNT trigger and pushes it, exploding the bridge, killing John, the soldiers, Warwick, and starts an avalanche. The avalanche buries the Russians. During Act II a player plays as John Black's [[Mercenaries]], which is modeled after a cross between the French and German civilizations.
This campaign is roughly similar to [[The Last of the Mohicans]], as the year is 1757 in both stories, John Black is similar to Hawkeye, Kanyenke to the Mohicans, Warwick to Montcalm and the French, and the Cherokee to the Hurons.

==== Act III: Steel ====
It is now 1817,<ref name=Steel>{{cite web|title=Walkthrough - Act III: Steel|publisher=IGN|url=http://uk.guides.ign.com/guides/721644/page_17.html|accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref> and the narrative shifts to Amelia Black, the granddaughter of John Black and heiress owner of The Falcon Company (possibly named after Sahin), a [[railroad company]] whose sights are set on expanding new railroad operations in the United States since the compensation given by the British and Americans for John Black's sacrifice has dried up. A [[France|French]] prospector named Pierre Beaumont helps her and the railroad boss, Major Cooper, defeat a [[Mexico|Mexican]] army attacking a fort. He then lures them to a northern mine, where a surprise visit from Kanyenke reveals Beaumont as the leader of Circle of Ossus. Amelia, Kanyenke, and Cooper chase him through the mines, where they find a map to the Lake of the Moon. They go there, but the lake has dried up and is now a swamp. They destroy a Circle base in the swamp. Cooper approaches Beaumont and Beaumont commands two wolves to attack him. Cooper shoots one of them with his pistol and the other kills him. Amelia now wants to avenge Cooper. The [[Seminoles]] tell Amelia and Kanyenke that there is an [[Inca]] city in [[Pacamayo Valley]] where several barrels of the fountain's water are. They sail to [[South America]], where they help [[Simon Bolivar]] defeat the Spanish, then go through the Andes and discover the Inca city in Pacamayo Valley. They defend the city from the Circle, who have a base there that they destroy. But Beaumont escapes with some of the Fountain's water. Amelia and Kanyenke fight the Circle at their stronghold in Cuba, and after allying with the Spanish colony of [[Havana]] and awaiting the arrival of the U.S. Navy, they destroy the Ossuary and the cannons guarding it. Amelia and Kanyenke go under a ledge, but Beaumont is hiding on top. Beaumont jumps down and attempts to stab Amelia. But Amelia dodges him and she and Kanyenke are knocked down. Beaumont charges at Amelia about to stab her, but when Beaumont gets near, she kicks him and Beaumont is pushed back. He quickly charges at her but she grabs her gun and shoots him. She later uses the Circle's stored treasure to revive the Falcon Company, and succeeds in building railroads to the west coast. During the credits, there is a final cutscene between Amelia and an Old Coot first introduced earlier in the campaign. After some conversation, he makes a reference to the Circle and how she was able to defeat them in only one lifetime, hinting that he is indeed Morgan who has lived longer than the average person because he drank from the Fountain of Youth after Act I. Amelia then asks what he just said and he replies with "don't miss your train," and then walks away. During Act III, the player plays as the U.S. civilization (only available in the campaign), which resembles the British civilization.

=== Technical features ===
[[Image:AoE3 Real-Physics All-in-One.JPG|thumb|300px|One of the most notable innovations of the game was the addition of the real physics engine, which animates battles as shown.]]

''Age of Empires III'' builds on and introduces new features to the ''[[Age of Mythology]]'' [[Game engine|engine]]. One new feature is the inclusion of the [[Havok (software)|Havok]] physics simulation [[middleware]] engine<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.havok.com/content/view/188/53/|title=Age of Empires III|publisher=Havok|accessdate=2006-11-26}}</ref> on the PC version and the similar [[PhysX]] engine on Mac OS X. This means that many events such as building destruction and tree falls will not be pre-created [[animation]]s, but rather will be calculated according to the physics engine, in an innovation for the series. Other graphical features of the game include bloom lighting and support for [[Pixel shader|pixel shader 3.0]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ageofempires3.com/Age3/Press/PressRelease2.aspx|title=Technology|publisher=Ensemble Studios|accessdate=2006-11-26}}</ref>

''Age of Empires III'' was well received by critics and reviewers. The game received an average score of 86%, and is the seventy-first most popular [[personal computer game]], according to [[Game Rankings]].<ref name="Game Rankings">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamestats.com/objects/721/721644/index.html# | title = Game Rankings Age of Empires III page | accessdate = 2007-10-14 | publisher = [[Game Rankings]]}}</ref> ''Age of Empires III'' was listed as the eighth best-selling PC game of 2005,<ref name="Best selling PC games, 2005">{{cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2006/01/19/top-selling-pc-games-of-2005/ | title = Best selling PC games of 2005 | accessdate = 2007-10-14 | date = [[2006-01-19]] | publisher = [[Joystiq]]}}</ref> and over two million copies of it had been sold by May 2007.<ref name="Two million copies" />

Reviewers had much to say about the new title in the ''[[Age of Empires series|Age of Empires]]'' franchise. [[GameSpot]] pointed out that "Age of Empires III has some very big shoes to fill,"<ref name="GameSpot review, page 3">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/ageofempiresiii/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=tabs&tag=tabs%3Breviews&page=3 | title = GameSpot review, page 3 | author = [[Greg Kasavin]] | accessdate = 2007-10-14 | date = [[2005-10-14]] | publisher = [[GameSpot]]}}</ref> and [[GameSpy]] remarked that it "may not redefine real-time strategy gaming, but it sets the bar so high that we will be comparing games to this for years."<ref name="GameSpy review, page 3">{{cite web | url = http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/age-of-empires-iii/659812p3.html | title = GameSpy review, page 3 | author = Dave "Fargo" Kosak | accessdate = 2007-10-14 | date = [[2005-10-19]] | publisher = [[GameSpy]]}}</ref> [[IGN]] also commented on the game, saying "Age of Empires III is a superbly balanced and polished game," and that "Discounting a few niggles in the interface, the whole presentation is rock solid."<ref name="IGN review, page 4">{{cite web | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/658/658624p4.html | title = IGN review, page 4 | author = Steve Butts | accessdate = 2007-10-14 | date = [[2005-10-14]] | publisher = [[IGN]]}}</ref> WorthPlaying described ''Age of Empires III'' as "a must-have for anyone fond of...RTS gaming,"<ref name="WorthPlaying review" /> while [[Game Revolution]] complained that it is "as detailed as a history book, and about as much fun;"<ref name="Game Revolution review" /> [[GameZone]] disagreed, and said it was "one purchase you will not come to regret."<ref name="GameZone review" />

The game's visuals were highly praised by all reviewers. In a preview, IGN said that "After seeing the screenshots, our jaws hit the floor at the amount of detail,"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/579/579174p1.html | title = 2005 strategy gaming preview | accessdate = 2007-10-14 | date = [[2005-01-11]] | publisher = [[IGN]]}}</ref> while in their review, [[1UP]] described it as "one of the most beautiful games you will put on your computer for the foreseeable future;"<ref name="1UP review" /> GameSpy agreed, stating, "''Age III'''s graphics are unmatched in the strategy genre."<ref name="GameSpy review, page 1" /> GameSpot also admired the graphics, but had a negative comment as well; they said, "Were it not for the awkward unit behavior...''Age of Empires III'' would look truly amazing."<ref name="GameSpot review, page 3" /> GameSpy awarded ''Age of Empires III'' the "Best Graphics" award at GameSpy's "Game of the Year 2005," mentioning that the graphics engine boasted "all the high-end technology you had normally find in [[first-person shooters]]."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://goty.gamespy.com/2005/pc/index20.html | title = GameSpy's Game of the Year 2005, Best Graphics | accessdate = 2007-10-14 | publisher = [[GameSpy]]}}</ref>

The in-game audio was also commented upon. GameZone praised the sound effects, saying that "you will feel the explosions of the cannon balls, the muskets firing their endless volleys, and the destruction of a building. It all sounds extremely realistic, and makes the game come that much more alive."<ref name="GameZone review" /> [[Eurogamer]] briefly said "AoE3...sounds fantastic,"<ref name="Eurogamer review" /> while Game Revolution mentioned that "The ambient sounds, music and voice work all suit the colonial theme."<ref name="Game Revolution review" /> However, IGN was not as impressed, saying that the sound was "Good enough...but does not stand out."<ref name="IGN review, page 4" />

Reviewers were divided as to the single player campaign. GameSpot thought it was "standard for a real-time strategy game," but also complained that it had "less-than-stellar voice work and awkward cutscenes;"<ref name="GameSpot review, page 3" /> GameSpy agreed that ''Age of Empires III's'' campaign is not revolutionary, but thought that "the voice acting is great."<ref name="GameSpy review, page 2">{{cite web | url = http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/age-of-empires-iii/659812p2.html | title = GameSpy review, page 2 | author = Dave "Fargo" Kosak | accessdate = 2007-10-15 | date = [[2005-10-19]] | publisher = [[GameSpy]]}}</ref> IGN praised the campaign's story, in that it gave the player a "nice sense of purpose"; they thought "The 24-mission campaign is very well designed."<ref name="IGN review, page 1">{{cite web | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/658/658624p1.html | title = IGN review, page 1 | author = Steve Butts | accessdate = 2007-10-17 | date = [[2005-10-14]] | publisher = [[IGN]]}}</ref> Eurogamer said the campaign lacked originality, in because though it was "well-written and imaginatively framed" it  "offers exactly the same kind of challenges that RTS campaigns have been offering for years;"<ref name="Eurogamer review" /> Game Revolution disliked the campaign more than the other reviewers. Comparing it to ''Age of Empires II'''s campaign, they said: "The plot actually got worse. ''Age of Empires III''...avoids all the interesting and prickly issues like genocide, epidemics and slavery, instead subbing in a wimpy tale of a family destined to protect the Holy Grail from a Satanic Cult."<ref name="Game Revolution review" />

''Age of Empires III's'' multiplayer was highly lauded, and the home city was so as well. In the WorthPlaying review, it was briefly mentioned that multiplayer is "the meat of AoE3."<ref name="WorthPlaying review" /> The topic of multiplayer was touched by GameZone, who said "this game demands multiplayer mode, and Ensemble Studios provided this for the players,"<ref name="GameZone review" /> while at 1UP, the reviewer said similarly that "Multiplayer support has been significantly upgraded with a slick interface, support for clans and a number of other useful features."<ref name="1UP review" /> VideoGamer stated: "The multiplayer mode is likely to entertain well beyond the campaign and will no doubt keep you busy;" GameSpy merged the topics of multiplayer and the home city, saying, "One nice side effect...is that, even if you get totally ass-whupped in a multiplayer game, you probably still earned a lot of experience to...develop your city."<ref name="GameSpy review, page 2" /> WorthPlaying also mentioned the home city, calling it "the best new feature in the game."<ref name="WorthPlaying review" /> GameSpy commented on the home city as well, saying "the 'home city' system creates long-term depth and strategy."<ref name="GameSpot review, page 1" />The only negative comment about the home city was made by EuroGamer: "Stop with the gifts!...You do not need to let me flick to a home city screen every few minutes so that I can select a free unit or resource windfall. I'm not some spoilt toddler that needs to be bribed with endless sweeties."<ref name="Eurogamer review" />

The game was presented with two awards by [[GameSpy]] in 2005: 'Real-time strategy game of the year'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goty.gamespy.com/2005/pc/index15.html|title=GameSpy RTS game of the year award|publisher=Gamespy|accessdate=2006-11-26}}</ref> and 'Best Graphics'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goty.gamespy.com/2005/pc/index20.html|title=GameSpy Best Graphics award|publisher=Gamespy|accessdate=2006-11-26}}</ref> It was also given an 'honorable mention' in the 'Best Music' category.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goty.gamespy.com/2005/pc/index21.html|title=GameSpy honorable mention for 'Best Music'|publisher=GameSpy|accessdate=2006-11-26}}</ref> GameSpy was highly praising of the game overall, giving it 5 stars in its review,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/age-of-empires-iii/659812p1.html|title=Age of Empires III|publisher=GameSpy|accessdate=2006-06-22}}</ref> which was particularly positive about the graphics and multiplayer experience. The game was named 5th best game of 2005 by GameSpy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goty.gamespy.com/2005/pc/index8.html|title=GameSpy's Game of the Year 2006|publisher=GameSpy|accessdate=2007-06-22}}</ref>

Other awards,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agecommunity.com/awards_xp.aspx|title=Awards|publisher=Ensemble Studios|accessdate=2006-11-26}}</ref> including an 'Outstanding' from GameZone,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r25458.htm|title=Age of Empires III Review|publisher=GameZone|accessdate=2006-11-26}}</ref> reflect the positive critical reception of the game.

[[Yahoo!]]'s report<ref>{{cite web|url=http://videogames.yahoo.com/gamereview?cid=1991674977&tab=reviews&page=0&eid=-1|title=Age of Empires III Review|publisher=Yahoo|accessdate=2006-11-26}}</ref> had many positive features. They praised the effort put into the graphics and physics but maintained that these are essentially eye-candy. They were disappointed by the traditional economics-based strategy of the game and believed that this, coupled with the lack of useful formation and tactics, meant that the game does not stand up to other modern real-time strategy games. Eurogamer shared these final thoughts and described the new homecity shipments, along with all the treasures scattered around the map, as silly and childish ways of trying to complement the game's lack of strategy and tactical choices. Still, it recognized that Ensemble Studios was brave to implement "something quite different" from other real time strategy games, the homecity concept.<ref name="Eurogamer review" />
