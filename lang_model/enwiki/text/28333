'''Parry Sound District''' is a [[census division]] of the [[Canadian province]] of [[Ontario]].  Its seat is [[Parry Sound, Ontario|Parry Sound]].  Its boundaries are [[Muskoka District Municipality, Ontario|Muskoka]] to the south, the [[Sudbury District, Ontario|Sudbury District]], the [[French River (Ontario)|French River]] and [[Lake Nipissing]] in the north, [[Nipissing District, Ontario]] and [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]] in the north and east and parts of [[Algonquin Provincial Park|Algonquin Park]] in the northeast.

In 2006, the population was 40,918.<ref name="Census"/> The land area is 9,222.04 km (5,730 mi); the population density was 4.4 people/km (2.7 people/mi).

Although geographically in [[Southern Ontario]], the Parry Sound District is the only [[Census divisions of Ontario|census division]] in the southern part of the province which does not have an incorporated county, [[regional municipality]] or [[district municipality]] level of government, instead serving as a purely territorial division like the districts of [[Northern Ontario]]. 

In lieu of an upper tier of municipal administration, all government services in the district are provided either by the local municipalities or by the provincial government itself. Some communities which are not part of any incorporated municipality are served by [[local services board (Ontario)|local services boards]]. The district is also included in the service area of [[FedNor]] and the [[Northern Ontario Heritage Fund]]. Accordingly, in some contexts the division is grouped with the [[Northern Ontario]] region instead of Southern Ontario.

==Forest fire protection history==
{{seealso|wildfire suppression}}
The Parry Sound Forest Fire District was founded by Ontario's former Department of Lands and Forests (now the MNR) in 1922 as one of 17 districts to help protect Ontario's forests from fire by early detection from [[fire tower]]s. The headquarters for the district were housed in the town of Parry Sound. It was the central location for 21 [[fire tower]] lookouts, including the Parry Sound fire tower, which was erected in the same location as the modern lookout tower at 17 George Street. The other 20 towers in the district were: Pickerel River CPR, Byng Inlet, Still River, Pointe au Baril, Pakesley, Pickerel River CNR, Key Junction, Ardbeg, Spence, Go Home, Loring, Stormy Lake (Restoule), Nipissing, Boulter, Lount, Laurier, Strong, Proudfoot, Stisted and Draper. When a fire was spotted in the forest a towerman would get the degree bearings from his respective tower and radio back the information to headquarters. When one or more towermen from other towers in the area would also call in their bearings, the forest rangers at headquarters could get a 'triangulation' read and plot the exact location of the fire on their map. This way a team of forest firefighters could be dispatched as soon as possible to get the fire under control. In 1969 there remained only 4 actively manned towers: Ardbeg, Go Home, Stormy Lake, and Boulter. These would all be phased out shortly after when aerial fire fighting techniques were employed in the 1970s.
