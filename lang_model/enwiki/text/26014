==In the media==
D'Souza has been often tagged in the media as the "bubbly girl", after portraying the role of a young energetic girl in several movies, especially ''[[Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na]]'' (2008).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Bollywood/Genelias-the-new-bubbly-girl/articleshow/4310080.cms|title=Genelia's the new bubbly girl|publisher=''[[The Times of India]]''|accessdate=2010-01-01|date=2009-03-25}}</ref> She appeared alongside [[Shahid Kapoor]] on the fourth episode of ''[[Tere Mere Beach Mein]]'', a celebrity chat show, hosted by [[Farah Khan]].

==Personal life==
D'Souza is deeply religious and is a devout [[Roman Catholic]]. She says that, she regularly attends Sunday Mass at St. Anne's Parish (Bandra), and whenever the family is home, a part of their evening is reserved for saying the [[rosary]] together.<ref name="god">{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mobile/report.asp?n=1247041|title=I'm God's favourite child: Genelia D'Souza|last=Tahseen|first=Ismat |publisher=''[[DNA (newspaper)|Daily News and Analysis]]'' (DNA)|date=2009-04-11|accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[The Times of India]]'', she comments, "I keep a Novena every Wednesday at [[St. Michael's Church (Mumbai)|St. Michael<U+2019>s Church]] in [[Mahim]]."<ref name="ban"/> In an interview with ''[[DNA (newspaper)|Daily News and Analysis]]'', she said that "My communication with God is conversational, [...] I'm God's favourite child; I believe that God has always been kind to me."<ref name="god"/> Tabloids have repeatedly linked D'Souza romantically with [[Ritesh Deshmukh]], ever since they starred together in their debut film ''[[Tujhe Meri Kasam]]'' in 2003.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-4597375,prtpage-1.cms|title=Still denying Ritesh, Genelia?|work=[[Mumbai Mirror]]|publisher=[[The Times Group]]|accessdate=2010-01-01|date=2009-05-30|last=Jha|first=Subash K.}}</ref> They were reportedly ready to get engaged, but Ritesh's father, the then-Maharashtra Chief Minister, [[Vilasrao Deshmukh]] did not agree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/getahead/2008/aug/25slide9.htm |work=Rediff News||publisher=[[Rediff]] |title=Genelia D'Souza: Age 21|accessdate=2008-08-04|date=2008-08-25}}</ref> Ever since then, D'Souza has strongly denied any rumors of a relationship with Deshmukh, and responds that she has just friendly relations with him.<ref name="hin1"/>
