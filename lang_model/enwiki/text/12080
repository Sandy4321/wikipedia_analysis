==In the media==
Publications such as ''[[W magazine|W]]'' have stated that the actress carries, what the magazine described as, a good-girl image.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wmagazine.com/celebrities/2011/06/woody-allen-movie-muses |first=Lynn |last=Hirschberg |title=Woody<U+2019>s Women |work=[[W magazine|W]] |publisher=Conde Nast Publications |date=June 2011 |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}</ref> After her breakthrough in 2004, McAdams was considered to be a rising star and dubbed the new "Hollywood [[it girl]]" of movies, an honor she did not accept when it was foisted upon her.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/awards/rachel-mcadams/ |title=Oscar buzz for Rachel McAdams <U+2013> or just Golden Globes? |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Tirbune Company |date=November 2, 2010 |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/08/15/time-travelers-wife-welcome-back-rachel-mcadams/ |title='Time Traveler's Wife': Welcome back, Rachel McAdams? |work=Missy |last=Schwartz |work=Entertainment Weekly  |date=August 15, 2009 |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}</ref><ref name="interview54">{{citation |title=Rachel McAdams |work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] |publisher=[[Brant Publications]] |first=Owen |last=Wilson |authorlink=Owen Wilson |date=July 2005 |page=54 |volume=XXXV}}</ref> Her consistent box office hit stats also led to others predicting McAdams to be among some of the biggest stars in the world.<ref name="itgirlew"/> Those box office numbers also led to McAdams being dubbed "The next [[Julia Roberts]]".

An ''Entertainment Weekly'' writer considered McAdams to be the female version of [[Paul Rudd]], an actor beloved by the public and peers.<ref name="itgirlew"/> McAdams was included on a quantification list done by E-Poll Research, a market research agency dedicated to ranking celebrities and brand icons that continuously asks thousands of consumers to rank stars on a list of attributes and then divides the results based on the respondents demographics.

According to the January 2010 issue of [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'' magazine]], the actress is enrolled in knife-skill classes in a small kitchenware store at [[Kensington Market]]. Speaking to the publication about her [[environmental awareness]], McAdams explained that while she does now look at the world through green lenses, she tries not to make herself go crazy about certain things.<ref name="vogue1090"/> Also, the actress does not use air conditioners as it makes her feel as though she is not living in the real world and often keeps using worn-out clothing, some of which she has had since her early 20s.<ref name="vogue1090"/>

Along with friends Megan Kuhlmann and Didi Bethurum, the actress runs an eco-friendly lifestyle website{{endash}} GreenIsSexy.org, first established in 2007.<ref name="ellejune2011"/> "We have a tip that changes every day and we spotlight people and places, so that's sort of where I get some practice," McAdams said.<ref name="peoplegreen">{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20268785,00.html?xid=rss-topheadlines |title=Rachel McAdams: I Just Heard About Twitter |first=Liz |last=Berman |work=People |date=March 30, 2009 |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}</ref> For several years she was a [[vegetarian]], but eventually gave up the practice as it was making her too tired.
