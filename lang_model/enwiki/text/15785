A '''tooth''' (plural '''teeth''') is a small, [[calcification|calcified]], whitish structure found in the [[jaw]]s (or [[mouth]]s) of many [[vertebrate]]s and used to [[Mastication|break down]] [[food]]. Some animals, particularly [[carnivore]]s, also use teeth for hunting or for defensive purposes. The roots of teeth are covered by [[gingiva|gums]]. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of multiple tissues of varying density and hardness. The cellular tissues that ultimately become teeth originate from the embryonic germ layer, the [[ectoderm]]

The general structure of teeth is similar across the vertebrates, although there is considerable variation in their form and position. The [[Mammal tooth|teeth of mammals]] have deep roots, and this pattern is also found in some fish, and in [[crocodilian]]s. In most [[teleost]] fish, however, the teeth are attached to the outer surface of the bone, while in [[lizard]]s they are attached to the inner surface of the jaw by one side. In [[cartilaginous fish]], such as sharks, the teeth are attached by tough [[ligament]]s to the hoops of [[cartilage]] that form the jaw.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 300<U+2013>310|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>

Teeth are among the most distinctive (and long-lasting) features of [[mammal]] species. [[Paleontology|Paleontologists]] use teeth to identify [[fossil]] species and determine their relationships. The shape of the [[animal]]'s teeth are related to its diet. For example, plant matter is hard to digest, so [[herbivore]]s have many [[Molar (tooth)|molars]] for [[mastication|chewing]] and grinding. [[Carnivore]]s, on the other hand, need [[canine (tooth)|canines]] to kill prey and to tear meat.

[[Mammals]] are [[diphyodont]], meaning that they develop two sets of teeth. In [[humans]], the first set (the "baby," "milk," "primary" or "[[deciduous teeth|deciduous]]" set) normally starts to appear at about six months of age, although some babies are born with one or more visible teeth, known as [[neonatal teeth]].  Normal [[tooth eruption]] at about six months is known as [[teething]] and can be painful. 

Some animals develop only one set of teeth (monophyodont) while others develop many sets (polyphyodont). [[Shark]]s, for example, grow a new set of teeth every two weeks to replace worn teeth. [[Rodent]] incisors grow and wear away continually through gnawing, which helps maintain relatively constant length. The industry of the [[beaver]] is due in part to this qualification. Many rodents such as [[vole]]s (but not [[mice]]) and [[guinea pig]]s, as well as [[leporidae]] like [[rabbit]]s, have continuously growing molars in addition to incisors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tummers M, Thesleff I |title=Root or crown: a developmental choice orchestrated by the differential regulation of the epithelial stem cell niche in the tooth of two rodent species |journal=Development |volume=130 |issue=6 |pages=1049<U+2013>57 |year=2003 |month=March |pmid=12571097 |doi=10.1242/dev.00332 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hunt AM |title=A description of the molar teeth and investing tissues of normal guinea pigs |journal=J.

Teeth are not always attached to the jaw, as they are in mammals. In many [[reptile]]s and fish, teeth are attached to the [[palate]] or to the floor of the mouth, forming additional rows inside those on the jaws proper. Some teleosts even have teeth in the [[pharynx]]. While not true teeth in the usual sense, the [[denticle]]s of sharks are almost identical in structure, and are likely to have the same evolutionary origin. Indeed, teeth appear to have first evolved in sharks, and are not found in the more primitive [[jawless fish]] - while [[lamprey]]s do have tooth-like structures on the tongue, these are in fact, composed of [[keratin]], not of dentine or enamel, and bear no relationship to true teeth.<ref name=VB/>

Living [[amphibian]]s typically have small teeth, or none at all, since they commonly feed only on soft foods. In reptiles, teeth are generally simple and conical in shape, although there is some variation between species, most notably the venom-injecting [[fang]]s of [[snake]]s. The pattern of incisors, canines, premolars and molars is found only in mammals, and to varying extents, in their [[mammal-like reptiles|evolutionary ancestors]]. The numbers of these types of teeth varies greatly between species; [[zoology|zoologists]] use a standardised [[dental formula]] to describe the precise pattern in any given group.<ref name=VB/>

=== Aardvark ===

In [[Aardvark]]s, teeth lack enamel and have many pulp tubules, hence the name of the order [[Tubulidentata]].

=== Canines ===
{{Main|Canine tooth}}

In [[dogs]], the teeth are less likely than humans to form dental cavities because of the very high pH of dog saliva, which prevents enamel from demineralizing.<ref>Chris C. Pinney, ''The Illustrated Veterinary Guide for Dogs, Cats, Birds, and Exotic Pets'' (Blue Ridge Summit, PA: TAB Books, 1992), p. 187.</ref>

=== Cetaceans ===

Like human teeth, [[whale]] teeth have polyp-like protrusions located on the root surface of the tooth. These polyps are made of cementum in both species, but in human teeth the protrusions are located on the outside of the root, while in whales the nodule is located on the inside of the pulp chamber. While the roots of human teeth are made of cementum on the outer surface, whales have cementum on the entire surface of the tooth with a very small layer of enamel at the tip. This small enamel layer is only seen in older whales where the cementum has been worn away to show the underlying enamel.<ref>"Common Characteristics of Whale Teeth" [http://www.antiquescrimshaw.org/index.htm here]</ref>

The toothed whale is a [[suborder]] of the [[cetacean]]s characterized by having teeth.  The teeth differ considerably among the species. They may be numerous, with some [[dolphin]]s bearing over 100 teeth in their jaws.  On the other hand, the [[narwhal]]s have a giant unicorn-like tusk, which is a tooth containing millions of sensory pathways and used for sensing during feeding, navigation and mating. It is the most neurologically complex tooth known.  [[Beaked whales]] are almost toothless, with only bizarre teeth found in males.  These teeth may be used for feeding but also for demonstrating aggression and showmanship.

{{Main|Horse teeth}}

An adult [[horse]] has between 36 and 44 teeth. The enamel and dentin layers of horse teeth are intertwined.<ref>Encarta article found [http://encarta.msn.com/text_761561931__1/Teeth.html here] and Randall-Bowman, whose link can be found [http://rev.tamu.edu/stories/04/041504-6.html here]</ref> All horses have 12 premolars, 12 molars, and 12 incisors.<ref name=Pence2002>{{Cite document |date=2002 |author=Patricia Pence |title=Equine Dentistry: A Practical Guide |place=Baltimore |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |isbn=0-683-30403-8 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=o4KVGceXBNIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Equine+dentistry%22&cd=1#v=onepage&q&f=false |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

However, few female horses (less than 28%) have canines, and those that do usually have only one or two, which many times are only partially erupted.<ref name=Cirelli>{{Cite document |date= |author=Al Cirelli |title=Equine Dentition |place=Nevada |publisher=University of Nevada |url=http://www.unce.unr.edu/publications/files/ag/2000/sp0008.pdf |accessdate=7 June 2010 |postscript= <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

They are equally common in male and female horses and much more likely to be on the upper jaw.  If present these can cause problems as they can interfere with the horse's [[bit (horse)|bit]] contact. Therefore, wolf teeth are commonly removed.<ref name=Pence2002/>

[[Horse teeth]] can be used to estimate the animal's age.  Between birth and five years, age can be closely estimated by observing the eruption pattern on milk teeth and then permanent teeth.  By age five, all permanent teeth have usually erupted. The horse is then said to have a "full" mouth.  After the age of five, age can only be conjectured by study of the wear patterns on the incisors, shape, the angle at which the incisors meet, and other factors. The wear of teeth may also be affected by diet, natural abnormalities, and [[Cribbing (horse)|cribbing]].  Two horses of the same age may have different wear patterns.

A horse's incisors, premolars, and molars, once fully developed, continue to erupt as the grinding surface is worn down through chewing. A young adult horse will have teeth which are 4.5-5&nbsp;inches long, with the majority of the crown remaining below the gumline in the dental socket. The rest of the tooth will slowly emerge from the jaw, erupting about 1/8" each year, as the horse ages. When the animal reaches old age, the crowns of the teeth are very short and the teeth are often lost altogether. Very old horses, if lacking molars, may need to have their [[fodder]] ground up and soaked in water to create a soft mush for them to eat in order to obtain adequate nutrition.

=== Proboscideans ===
[[File:Mammoth ivory hg.jpg|thumb|Section through the ivory tusk of a mammoth]]

[[Elephant]]s' [[tusk]]s are specialized incisors for digging food up and fighting.  Some of elephant teeth are similar to those in [[manatee]]s, and it is notable that elephants are believed to have undergone an [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]] phase in their evolution. 

Elephants have four [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s, one on each side of the upper and lower jaw. Until age 40, these are replaced by larger molars. The new molars shift forward from the back of the [[jaw]] as the old wear down. The final set of molars last for about twenty years.<ref>Bram, L. et. al. MCMLXXXIII. ''Elephants.''

=== Rabbit ===

[[Rabbit]]s and other [[lagomorph]]s usually shed their deciduous teeth before (or very shortly after) their birth, and are usually born with their permanent teeth.<ref>[http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?cls=18&cat=1798&articleid=3078 Dental Anatomy & Care for Rabbits and Rodents<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The teeth of rabbits complement their diet, which consist of a wide range of vegetation.  Since many of the foods are abrasive enough to cause attrition, rabbit teeth grow continuously throughout life.<ref>Brown, Susan. [http://www.rabbit.org/chapters/san-diego/health/dental_disease.html Rabbit Dental Diseases], hosted on the [http://www.rabbit.org/chapters/san-diego/ San Diego Chapter of the House Rabbit Society].  Page accessed April 9, 2007.</ref>  Rabbits have a total of 6 incisors, three upper premolars, three upper molars, two lower premolars, and two lower molars on each side.  There are no canines.  Three to four millimeters of tooth is worn away by incisors every week, whereas the posterior teeth require a month to wear away the same amount.<ref>Ry<U+0161>avy, Robin. [http://www.mohrskc.org/hrswebpg23.html The Missouri House Rabbit Society], hosted by the [http://www.mohrskc.org/index.html Kansas City Missouri House Rabbit Society]. Page accessed April 9, 2007.</ref>

The incisors and cheek teeth of rabbits are called aradicular hypsodont teeth.  This is sometimes referred to as an elodent dentition.  These teeth grow or erupt continuously.  The growth or eruption is held in balance by dental abrasion from chewing a diet high in fiber.

=== Rodents ===

[[Rodent]]s' incisors grow continuously throughout their lives, a process known as [[aradicular]].  Unlike humans whose [[ameloblasts]] die after [[tooth development]], rodents continually produce [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] and must wear down their teeth by gnawing on various materials.<ref>Caceci, Thomas. ''Veterinary Histology'' with subtitle "Digestive System: Oral Cavity" found [http://education.vetmed.vt.edu/Curriculum/VM8054/Labs/Lab17/Lab17.htm here].</ref>  These teeth are used for cutting wood, biting through the skin of fruit, or for defense.  The teeth have enamel on the outside and exposed [[dentin]] on the inside, so they self-sharpen during [[gnawing]].  On the other hand, continually growing molars are found in some rodent species, such as the [[sibling vole]] and the [[guinea pig]].<ref>Tummers M and Thesleff I.

(1959) 38(2):216-31.</ref>  There is variation in the dentition of the rodents, but generally, rodents lack canines and premolars, and have a space between their incisors and molars, called the [[Diastema (dentistry)|diastema]] region.

=== Manatee ===

Mandibular molars of [[manatees]] develop separately from the jaw and are encased in a bony shell separated by soft tissue.

=== Walrus ===

[[Walrus]] tusks are canine teeth that grow continuously throughout life.<ref>[http://www.uic.edu/classes/orla/orla312/CANINES.htm The Permanent Canine Teeth], hosted on the University of Illinois at Chicago website. Page accessed February 5, 2007.</ref>

== Fish ==
[[File:Surfacing great white shark.jpg|thumb|[[Shark tooth|Teeth]] of [[Great White Shark]]]]
{{See also|Shark tooth}}

[[Fish]], such as [[shark]]s, may go through many teeth in their lifetime.  The multiple replacement of teeth is known as [[polyphydont]]ia.

== Reptiles ==

The teeth of [[reptiles]] are replaced constantly during their life.  Juvenile [[crocodilians]] replace teeth with larger ones at a rate as high as 1 new tooth per socket every month.  Once adult, tooth replacement rates can slow to two years and even longer.  Over all, crocodilians may use 3,000 teeth from birth to death.  New teeth are created within old teeth.

Early fish such as the [[thelodonts]] had scales composed of dentine and an enamel-like compound, suggesting that the origin of teeth was scales which were retained in the mouth.  Fish as early as the late [[Cambrian]] had dentine in their exoskeleton, which may have functioned in defense or for sensing their environment.<ref name=Smith2007>Teaford, Mark F and Smith, Moya Meredith, 2007.
