'''''Lifesong''''' is the second studio album by [[Christian rock]] band [[Casting Crowns]], released on August 30, 2005 by [[Beach Street Records]] and [[Reunion Records]]. Produced by Mark A. Miller, ''Lifesong'' was the follow-up to the band's [[Casting Crowns (album)|self-titled]] debut album. Although the unexpected success of the first album led to tremendous demand for new music from Casting Crowns, [[lead vocalist]] [[Mark Hall (musician)|Mark Hall]] was advised by [[Steven Curtis Chapman]] (a co-producer of the debut album) and [[Mac Powell]] not to worry about commercial expectations. ''Lifesong'', which has a [[pop rock]] and [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]] sound, focuses on challenging believers and indicting piousness and hypocrisy in the Christian church. Worship themes are also prominent in the album.

''Lifesong'' was received positively by music critics. Many critics praised the album's songwriting, although others felt the album's sound was derivative. The album and its singles were nominated for many awards, with the album winning the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album]] at the [[48th Grammy Awards]] and the Dove Award for Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year at the [[37th GMA Dove Awards]]. It debuted and peaked at number nine on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Christian Albums]] chart, selling 71,000 copies in its first week. The 15th best-selling Christian album of the 2000s in the [[United States]], ''Lifesong'' has been [[RIAA certification|certified Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and has sold over 1.2 million copies in the United States. With the exception of "Set Me Free", which was only released to [[Christian CHR]] radio, all of the album's singles topped the ''Billboard'' [[Christian Songs]] and [[Hot Christian AC]] charts.

==Background and recording==
Following the unexpected success of their [[Casting Crowns (album)|first album]], there was tremendous demand for new music from Casting Crowns. Although [[lead vocalist]] [[Mark Hall (musician)|Mark Hall]], who either wrote or co-wrote all the songs on the album, felt "a little worried" about the band's follow-up album, fellow recording artists [[Steven Curtis Chapman]] (who co-produced the band's first album) and [[Mac Powell]] of [[Christian rock]] band [[Third Day]] encouraged Hall to "say what God wants you to say".<ref name="Breaking the Mold">{{cite journal|last=Price|first=Deborah Evans|date=September 10, 2005|title=Breaking the Mold|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|volume=117|issue=37|pages=28-29|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sBMEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref> They also advised him to not worry about commercial expectations or whether "people are going to like it".<ref name="Breaking the Mold" /> Ultimately, Hall "absorbed" the feedback their first record had received, using it as inspiration.<ref name="Breaking the Mold" /> ''Lifesong'' focuses mainly on the the "truth-can-be-a-tough-pill-to-swallow message" that "there are broken people within arm<U+2019>s reach of the church, and if there is any hope of healing, it begins with people who will be the hands and feet of Jesus".<ref name="Real Life Conversations">{{cite journal|last=Riddle|first=Melissa|date=September 2005|title=Real Life Conversations|journal=[[CCM Magazine]]|publisher=[[Salem Publishing]]|volume=28|issue=3|pages=32-38|url=http://ht.salemweb.net/ccm/ccmmagazine/pdf/200509.pdf|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref> Hall responded to critics who felt the band's material was "preaching to the choir" by saying "How can writing songs that challenge the church, songs that ask Christians to consider their actions, be a bad thing? After all, it<U+2019>s the message that matters... Everybody is passionate about what
they do, about what they feel called to, so for one to say the other<U+2019>s ministry is more or less meaningful or spiritual or anything is ridiculous".<ref name="Real Life Conversations" /> Hall also felt that there were "too many walls in Christian music" and said "I think people listen to you if you<U+2019>re transparent... People want to hear the truth. You just hang around church for a while, and you<U+2019>ll see. People
don<U+2019>t want you to talk around it. They want you to tell it like it is, even if it hurts".<ref name="Real Life Conversations" /> Hall ultimately wrote songs such as "Does Anybody Hear Her" and "Stained Glass Masquerade", which "challenge believers".<ref name="Breaking the Mold" /> According to Hall, he was trying to say that he didn't think it bothers the world if people in the church sin. Rather, he felt that the world is bothered when Christians act like they don't sin.<ref name="Breaking the Mold" />

''Lifesong'' was [[Record producer|produced]] by Mark A. Miller, with [[Audio recording|recording]] and [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] done by Sam Hewitt at Zoo Studio in [[Franklin, Tennessee]]. Additional recording was done at Lifesong Studio in [[McDonough, Georgia]]. The album was [[Audio mastering|mastered]] by Richard Dodd and [[audio engineering|engineered]] by Dale Oliver and John Lewis Lee III. The [[string section|strings]] on the album were arranged by Bobby Huff and were recorded at Little Big Studio by Boeho Shin and Daewoo Kim.<ref name="Album notes" />

==Composition==
Musically, ''Lifesong'' draws influence from [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]] and [[pop rock]] music.<ref name="CCM Magazine review" /><ref name="Christianity Today review" /> The album also has influence from [[contemporary worship music|worship]] music in the vein of [[U2]], with songs building into "sweeping choruses and dramatic climaxes".<ref name="System of a Down zooms way up with 'Hypnotize'" /> Much of the album's lyrical content is devoted to challenging the Christian church<ref name="Breaking the Mold" /><ref name="Real Life Conversations" /><ref name="About.com review" /><ref name="Billboard review" /> and indicting hypocrisy and piousness within the church.<ref name="CCM Magazine review" /> Songs such as [[Lifesong (song)|the title track]] and "Father, Spirit, Jesus" have worshipful lyrics<ref name="CCM Magazine review" /><ref name="Christianity Today review" /> while others such as "Stained Glass Masquerade"  note the inability of church congregations to share their burdens openly.<ref name="Christianity Today review" /> "[[Does Anybody Hear Her]]" condemns the church's focus on judging rather than realizing pain<ref name="About.com review" /> and gives the message than condemning other people is wrong.<ref name="CCM Magazine review" /> "Set Me Free" is set from the perspective of "the demon-possessed man", who is calling to Jesus for relief. It also incorporates more of a [[rock music|rock]] sound than Casting Crowns normally uses.<ref name="Christianity Today review" />

''Lifesong'' received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Kim Jones of [[About.com]] gave it five out of five stars, saying "Bottom line - my hat goes off to Casting Crowns for a job well done, once again. This is one band that doesn't soft-pedal their message, even if it is one that people enjoying a "comfort-zone" may not want to hear".<ref name="About.com review" /> Jared Johnson of [[Allmusic]] gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars, opining "One of the brightest spots on the CCM map in 2005, ''Lifesong'' was powered by a second dose of Mark Hall's earnestly challenging worship themes and a penchant for reflective pop... From start to finish, the album showcases songwriting that is consistent, polished, and potent, furthering the septet's reputation as one of Christian music's most popular acts of the 21st century".<ref name="Allmusic reivew" /> Deborah Evans Price of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' said that "there is no sophomore letdown here for Casting Crowns... This is intelligent, soulful music that goes beyond mere entertainment to something deeper".<ref name="Billboard review" /> David McCreary of ''[[CCM Magazine]]'' gave ''Lifesong'' an A-, opining "staying true to their approach of assimilating crisp melodies, forthright lyrics and stout vocals, the Crowns effectively blend uptempo worship anthems and emotive ballads for another well-balanced set".<ref name="CCM Magazine review" /> Russ Breimeier of ''[[Christianity Today]]'', while calling the music "derivative", said that "[Casting Crowns] fans will find much to love, while others continue to ponder the secret of this band's success. All can probably agree that Lifesong is a sequel in the truest sense, offering more of the same to the delight of those so touched and inspired by the music of Casting Crowns the first time".<ref name="Christianity Today review" />

Simon Eden of ''[[Cross Rhythms]]'' gave the album ten out of ten stars, saying "With 'Lifesong' being officially [Casting Crowns'] second release, the pressure is on to see if they can deliver. The simple answer is quite probably yes as the band use a refreshing formula that challenges the Church instead of serving up milk and cookies".<ref name="Cross Rhythms review" /> John DiBiase of [[Jesus Freak Hideout]] gave it three out of five stars, opining "Overall, ''Lifesong'' is musically an assortment of experimentation and familiarity, as the band continues to offer songs with relatable messages to the church body. Frontman and chief songwriter Mark Hall's strained, shouting-style vocals is [sic] still an acquired taste, along with his straightforward and often simplistic lyrics, but ''Lifesong'' is a noteworthy second chapter in an already impressive career for this young band".<ref name="JFH Review" /> [[Brian Mansfield]] of ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting "[Casting Crowns] comes from the school of [[U2]]-influenced modern-worship music, so its songs predictably build to sweeping choruses and dramatic climaxes. The band's message is more distinctive, calling out the "happy plastic people under shiny plastic steeples" to offer themselves to the lonely, the grieving, the desperate".<ref name="System of a Down zooms way up with 'Hypnotize'" />

''Lifesong'' and its singles received various awards and nominations.
