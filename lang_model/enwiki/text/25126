''ATL'' was the first [[feature film]] produced by its director and the majority of its cast. Filming took place during the summer over a forty-five day schedule in Atlanta. As the film was produced in Atlanta, director Chris Robinson was able to get many celebrities from the city to make cameo appearances, including, though not limited to, [[Jazze Pha]], [[Killer Mike]], and [[Monica (singer)|Monica]].

''ATL'' opened on March 31, 2006, and on its opening weekend the film grossed a total of $11,554,404, ranking third in the U.S. box office.<ref name="First week box office">{{cite news|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2006&wknd=13&p=.htm|title=Weekend Box Office Results for March 31-April 2, 2006|accessdate=2008-[[October 7|10-07]]|work=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> It eventually went on to gross approximately $21 million, replenishing the film's $20 million budget. ''ATL'' received mixed, though generally favorable reviews from critics, and was nominated for numerous awards.

==Plot==
Rashad ([[T.I.|Harris]]) is a teen living in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] with his Uncle George ([[Mykelti Williamson|Williamson]]) and his little brother Ant ([[Evan Ross|Ross]]). He and his brother have been raised by George since their parents died in a car accident, and they work with him at the Swann Cleaning Service, the family's business which George took over when Rashad's parents passed. When not working or finishing his last year of high school, Rashad spends most of his time with his friends Brooklyn ([[Albert Daniels]]), Teddy ([[Jason Weaver]]), and Esquire ([[Jackie Long|Long]]). Rashad is a talented artist but doesn't see much of a future in that field as he's become accustomed to working the family business. Esquire, Rashad's best friend, goes to a [[University-preparatory school|prep school]] on the opposite side of town from where they live, and is trying to attend an [[Ivy League|Ivy League college]] after senior year. However, he finds out that he'll need a letter of recommendation from someone of high stature to better his chances of acceptance at the school he wants to attend.

Rashad and his friends are also a skate crew on Sunday nights at Cascade, a local skating rink where local teens hang out. While there, Rashad catches the eye of New New ([[Lauren London|London]]), a round-the-way girl with a mysterious background, since he only sees her around when she's hanging out with her friends Veda ([[Khadijah Haqq]]) and Star ([[Malika Haqq]]). The two become attracted to one another; in contrast, Esquire instantly develops a disliking for Rashad's new love interest, considering her bad company. Meanwhile, no longer under Rashad's watchful eyes, Ant becomes involved with a drug dealer named Marcus ([[Big Boi|Patton]]) and begins to sell for him.

[[Image:ATLScreenshot1.jpg|left|thumb|190px|(L-R) [[Jason Weaver]], [[Albert Daniels|Albe Daniels]], [[T.I.]], and [[Jackie Long]].]]

At work one day, Esquire meets John Garnett ([[Keith David]]), a millionaire who heads a successful business venture called the United Express. The two quickly become friends, with Garnett's admiration for Esquire's ambition and Esquire's respect for Garnett's success driving the relationship. Esquire sees an opportunity to obtain the letter of recommendation that would bring about his acceptance to his primary college choice. When Esquire goes to Garnett's house to pick up the letter, he meets his daughter Erin, who, to his surprise, turns out to be New New. Erin says she'll reveal where Esquire is really from (something he lied to her father about) if he tells Rashad about her.

Things soon begin to fall apart for Rashad; Ant is arrested for selling weed, and later Rashad finds out the truth about Erin. He no longer speaks to his friends, realizing Esquire knew about Erin the whole time. Esquire, feeling guilty about the way he obtained the letter, decides to return it to Garnett, and reveals the truth about himself and his background. He, Brooklyn, and Teddy attempt to make peace with Rashad and ask him to attend Skate Wars, Cascade's annual skate competition, with them; Rashad, however, refuses their offer. Just as he decides he'll go after being persuaded by his uncle, he finds out that Marcus is looking for Ant on the streets, searching for cash that Ant owes to him. Although Rashad is able to track the two down, Ant is shot by Marcus, albeit not fatally.

Rashad and Ant are able to reconnect; likewise, Erin, Esquire, and Rashad make peace. In the film's final scene, Teddy opens his own business concerning the production of gold teeth, Brooklyn finds job at a [[Krystal (restaurant)|Krystal]] restaurant, while Esquire receives a mysterious letter of recommendation (assumedly from Garnett) and is able to attend his college. The twins Veda and Star remain in the old neighborhood and hang out at Cascade on Sundays, while Erin goes to [[Spelman College]], the school she wanted to attend. Ant changes direction, discarding the notion of drug dealing, and begins to focus on his studies in school. Rashad, lastly, becomes a comic artist for the Sunday edition of the ''Atlanta Evening Standard'', the city's newspaper.

[[Chris Robinson (director)|Chris Robinson]], a renowned [[music video director]], was contacted with an offer to direct Austin and Watkins' visualization, and took on his first feature with ''ATL''. The films producers decided Robinson would be well-suited for the project because of his ability to capture the music-driven aspects of the film, as provided by his experience in the field. They also cited his talent in storytelling. According to producer Austin, "a lot of music video directors can't capture the story, so what we'd do was turn on the directors' tapes, turn down the music and just watch to see if we could find the story. Chris was far and away the best."<ref name="Production notes">{{cite news|title=ATL (2006) - Starring Tip "T.I."

Open auditions were held in Atlanta, [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[New York City|New York]] to comb the crowd for candidates who could compose the film's ensemble cast. Robinson had already decided he wanted relatively unknown actors to perform in the film. Once the cast was assembled, Robinson had his actors converge in Atlanta for six weeks to rehearse the script and familiarize themselves with each other.<ref name="Production notes">{{cite news|title=ATL (2006) - Starring Tip "T.I."

Three months prior to the start of production, the actors gathered at Atlanta<U+2019>s Skatetown to begin training for the skating sequences in the film. Some had never been on roller skates before. [[Vaughn Newton]], the actors' skate captain, worked with them rigorously, usually practicing five hours a day. <U+201C>[[Lauren London|Lauren]] and the twins, [[Malika Haqq|Malika]] and [[Khadijah Haqq|Khadijah]], adapted very quickly," said Newton. "The guys came along a little slower. [[Albert Daniels|Al Be]], [[Jason Weaver|Jason]] and [[Jackie Long]] developed very fast. [[T.I.]] was determined to learn.

In addition to the main cast, Robinson decided to include numerous cameos in the film, generally involving people popular in the Atlanta music scene, a core element of the movie. Music producer [[Jazze Pha]] played the skating rink's DJ; [[Organized Noize|Rico Wade]], a part of the Atlanta-based production team [[Organized Noize]], who also frequented Jellybeans in the early '90s, made an appearance as well. R&B singer [[Monica (singer)|Monica]], a prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> of producer Austin's, also plays a [[Waffle House]] waitress in the film. There are also cameos from rappers [[Bone Crusher (rapper)|Bone Crusher]], [[Konkrete]], and [[Killer Mike]].<ref name="Production notes">{{cite news|title=ATL (2006) - Starring Tip "T.I."

Dallas Austin coordinated the music for the film, which executive producer [[Timothy M. Bourne]] says is "all new music that's rooted in the Atlanta vibe." Austin had already produced his first feature with ''[[Drumline (film)|Drumline]]'' in 2002, and wanted to be sure ''ATL'' would be similarly authentic to the culture of his hometown by using its current hip-hop scene as the story's backdrop. Music in the environment of the rink was the way Austin pitched the film "as a way to make a musical without putting ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' on the screen... without the kids breaking into song. I'm determined to show [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] and New York the culture from the South."<ref name="Production notes">{{cite news|title=ATL (2006) - Starring Tip "T.I."

Filming took place in the summer, sometimes in temperatures over a hundred degrees, challenging the cast and crew's ability to stay motivated. "A lot of times we had to motivate each other to say 'listen, up your game. Go hard,'" said Robinson. "And sometimes we needed to step back, take a breath, so we could get through."<ref name="Behind the Scenes">{{cite video

===Design===
[[Chris Robinson (director)|Robinson]] and [[Robb Buono]], the film's [[production designer]], decided that the script was composed of two distinct parts &mdash; the reality of the teens' lives and the time they spent at the skating rink. According to Buono, "we wanted to look at it [the rink] through rose colored glasses, because when you think back on your memories of that time period <U+2014> no matter what age you are <U+2014> you see everything bigger. Our goal was to make that roller skating rink a character that grows as we keep coming back, and each time it<U+2019>s more magical &mdash; a ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''-like contrast to the reality of life.<U+201D> Robinson and Buono chose to shoot at the Cascade Family Skating Rink in Atlanta after visiting and witnessing the energy and excitement of the rink. However, the filmmakers felt Cascade's interior design was too bland and decided it should be redesigned.

Buono chose black and red for the rink's new color palette. Red was used for its intensity and energy, and black was utilized because the rink would appear larger. Additionally, usage of black would contrast more boldly with the red colors. The ceiling above the rink was removed for lighting purposes. The rink floor was also refinished with darker colors to provide better light reflection. Rigging for the lights became an artistic challenge for Buono. Working with the art department, the rigging electrics and the rigging grips, he designed a wagon wheel effect that moved with the motion of the skating and allowed the lights to be programmed, aesthetically lighting both ends of the rink and capturing the action of the skating sequences. The skate rental section, arcade and snack bar were redesigned at the rink as well, so that the areas besides the skating floor wouldn't feel monotonous. <U+201C>We did every inch of that rink,<U+201D> said Buono. <U+201C>The carpet on the walls, painting the ceiling, putting in the lights, painting the snack bar, changing the color of the tables. We used a lot of neon and bold bright colors.<U+201D><ref name="Production notes">{{cite news|title=ATL (2006) - Starring Tip "T.I."

==Critical reception==
At ''[[Allmovie]]'' the film was given three stars, and critic Derek Armstrong, in a positive review of the film, stated that the film is only an average coming of age story "because some substance must take a backseat to all this beautifully crafted style."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:339606~T1|title=allmovie ((( ATL > Review )))|accessdate=2008-[[October 9|10-09]]|work=[[Allmovie]]}}</ref> Melissa Walters at ''BlackFilm.com'', while believing some of the writing to be clich<U+00E9>d and the story familiar, also called the film "heartfelt, genuine, and enjoyable."<ref>{{cite news|title=March 2006 I blackfilm.com I reviews I film I ATL|last=Walters|first=Melissa|publisher=''BlackFilm.com''|date=2006-[[March 24|03-24]]|url=http://www.blackfilm.com/20060324/reviews/atl.shtml|accessdate=[[2008]]-[[October 9|10-09]]}}</ref> Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film three stars in his ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' review, declaring the film "warm" and praising the screenplay's "unforced, genuine affection for its characters."<ref>{{cite news|title=ATL :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews|last=Ebert|first=Roger|publisher=''[[Roger Ebert|RogerEbert.com]]''|date=2006-[[March 31|03-31]]|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060330/REVIEWS/60323002|accessdate=[[2008]]-[[October 9|10-09]]}}</ref> ''[[IGN|IGN.com]]'' gave the film a 4/5 rating, naming Robinson's directorial debut "masterful."<ref>{{cite news|title=IGN: ATL Review|last=Gilchrist|first=Todd|publisher=''IGN.com Movies''|date=2006|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/722/722919p1.html|accessdate=[[2008]]-[[October 11|10-11]]}}</ref> ''[[Metacritic]]'', a [[normalized]] film rating website, provided the film a 63/100 score.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/atl?q=ATL|title=ATL (2006): Reviews|accessdate=2008-[[October 9|10-09]]|work=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref> At the review aggregator site ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'', the film averaged a 63% approval rate as seen in the Cream of the Crop section of the website.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/atl/?critic=creamcrop|title=ATL Movie Reviews, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=2008-[[October 9|10-09]]|work=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref> Ruthe Stein from the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' called the film one of the better kind of its genre, praising the performances of the young cast, and the film's star [[T.I.]] in particular.<ref>{{cite news|title=Boys to men -- it's a tough transition for these young adults in Atlanta|last=Stein|first=Ruthe|publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle|SFGate.com]]''|date=2006-[[March 31|03-31]]|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/31/DDG9AI0BO51.DTL&type=movies|accessdate=[[2008]]-[[October 9|10-09]]}}</ref> At ''[[Yahoo!

All reviews of the picture weren't so enthusiastic, however. Lisa Schwarzbaum of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' graded the film a B-, saying that while the skating scenes are a blast, the film stumbles when it attempts to be too much for too many audiences.<ref>{{cite news|title=ATL I Movie Review I Entertainment Weekly|last=Schwarzbaum|first=Lisa|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly|EW.com]]''|date=2006-[[March 29|03-29]]|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1178139,00.html|accessdate=[[2008]]-[[October 9|10-09]]}}</ref> [[Neil Genzlinger]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said he was surprised that with so many untested actors rounding out the main cast, "the most amateurish thing about it is the script." Genzlinger also called the screenplay clich<U+00E9>-marred and predictable, while giving credit to the young actors of the film. He was also critical of [[Chris Robinson (director)|Chris Robinson]]'s direction, stating that he "can't stay with a scene long enough to let his actors build momentum."<ref>{{cite news|title=ATL - Movie - Review - The New York Times|last=Genzlinger|first=Neil|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=2006-[[March 31|03-31]]|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/movies/31atl.html|accessdate=[[2008]]-[[October 9|10-09]]}}</ref> At ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', Bob Longino provided a negative review of the movie, pointing it out as "boring, uninteresting, and slow". However, Longino did say that stars T.I. and [[Big Boi]]'s performances improved as the film progressed, and that there were a few laugh-out-loud comedic moments in the film.<ref>{{cite news|title=ATL - The Atlanta Journal-Constitution movie review I AccessAtlanta|last=Longino|first=Bob|publisher=''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|AccessAtlanta.com]]''|date=2006|url=http://www.accessatlanta.com/movies/content/shared/movies/reviews/A/atl/ajc.html|accessdate=[[2008]]-[[October 9|10-09]]}}</ref>
