'''New York State Route&nbsp;144''' ('''NY&nbsp;144''') is a [[state highway]] in the [[Capital District]] of [[New York]] in the United States. The highway runs for {{convert|14.74|mi}} as a two-lane road from an intersection with [[U.S. Route&nbsp;9W]] (US&nbsp;9W) in the [[Greene County, New York|Greene County]] town of [[New Baltimore, New York|New Baltimore]] to a junction with [[New York State Route 32|NY&nbsp;32]] in the town of [[Bethlehem, New York|Bethlehem]] just south of the [[Albany, New York|Albany]] city limits. NY&nbsp;144 closely parallels the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate&nbsp;87]] or I-87) and the west bank of the [[Hudson River]] as it heads across [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]. The Thruway and NY&nbsp;144 connect at exit&nbsp;22 about {{convert|6|mi}} south of Albany in Bethlehem.

NY&nbsp;144 was originally designated as part of [[New York State Route 10|NY&nbsp;10]] in the mid-1920s and as part of US&nbsp;9W from the late 1920s to the mid-1930s. In the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]], NY&nbsp;144 was assigned to what is now US&nbsp;9W between New Baltimore and Albany. The alignments of US&nbsp;9W and NY&nbsp;144 were flipped in the mid-1930s, placing the latter on a routing that extended north from Bethlehem to downtown Albany. NY&nbsp;144 was truncated to its present length in the late 1960s.

==Route description==

NY&nbsp;144 begins at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 9W|US&nbsp;9W]] in the town of [[New Baltimore, New York|New Baltimore]], just north of US&nbsp;9W's junction with [[County Route 51 (Greene County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;51]] (CR&nbsp;51). The route heads northeastward through New Baltimore as a two-lane rural roadway, crossing [[CSX Transportation]]'s [[West Shore Line]] before intersecting with a service road that connects to the New Baltimore Travel Plaza on the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 87|I-87]]). Not far from the junction, NY&nbsp;144 passes by a stretch of homes alongside the Thruway and crosses over the toll road, at which point the road enters a residential but wooded area of the town. This stretch leads to the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of New Baltimore, located on the west bank of the [[Hudson River]]. In the residential center of the community, NY&nbsp;144 intersects with the northern terminus of [[County Route 61 (Greene County, New York)|CR&nbsp;61]] (River Road). At this junction, NY&nbsp;144 makes a turn northward, following the riverbank out of the hamlet.<ref name="bing">{{bing maps |url=http://binged.it/KlTw6s |title=overview map of NY 144 |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}</ref>

Continuing northward, NY&nbsp;144 heads through gradually less developed areas as it crosses the [[Greene County, New York|Greene]]<U+2013>[[Albany County, New York|Albany]] county line and enters the town of [[Coeymans, New York|Coeymans]]. It crosses [[Hannacrois Creek]] just north of the county line on its way into the nearby [[Coeymans (hamlet), New York|hamlet of Coeymans]], where the route becomes known as Main Street. NY&nbsp;144 runs north<U+2013>south through the small residential community, intersecting with the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 143|NY&nbsp;143]] (Church Street) and passing over [[Coeymans Creek]] before exiting the area and becoming River Road. Outside of Coeymans, NY&nbsp;144 heads northward along a strip of land bounded by Coeymans Creek to the west and the Hudson River to the east. It serves a large industrial complex and passes under a long pipeline connection in an otherwise undeveloped and wooded area before trending to the northwest toward the nearby New York State Thruway. NY&nbsp;144 comes within {{convert|50|ft|m}} of the Thruway's northbound lanes before turning back to the northeast.<ref name="bing" />

The two highways remain close for the next {{convert|3.5|mi}}, with both roads continuing to traverse wooded areas of the town of Coeymans. NY&nbsp;144 serves a handful of isolated housing tracts before passing over a railroad line and under the [[Berkshire Connector]] of the Thruway, which terminates just west of the overpass at Thruway exit&nbsp;21A. Past the connector, the amount of development along NY&nbsp;144 slowly increases as the highway crosses into the town of [[Bethlehem, New York|Bethlehem]]. Here, the route intersects the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 396|NY&nbsp;396]] (Maple Avenue) just east of [[Selkirk, New York|Selkirk]] and finally connects to the Thruway at the toll road's exit&nbsp;22, located just north of the NY&nbsp;396 junction. After the Thruway exit, the freeway heads off to the north while NY&nbsp;144 takes a slightly northeasterly track toward Cedar Hill and Wemple, two small riverside hamlets about {{convert|2|mi}} apart on opposite sides of Vioman Kill.<ref name="bing" />

[[File:NY 144 at pipeline.jpg|right|thumb|NY&nbsp;144 approaching the long pipeline cover in the town of Coeymans]]
North of Wemple, the sporadic residences along the highway are replaced by a string of [[oil depot|tank farm]]s serving barges on the Hudson River. The industrial surroundings follow NY&nbsp;144 into the hamlet of [[Glenmont, New York|Glenmont]], centered around the route's junction with Glenmont Road. Here, NY&nbsp;144 crosses over another set of railroad tracks before heading northeastward from the community toward [[Normans Kill]]. The route runs alongside the Hudson River tributary and another set of tank farms to an intersection with [[New York State Route 32|NY&nbsp;32]] (Corning Hill Road) near the [[Port of Albany<U+2013>Rensselaer]], where the NY&nbsp;144 designation terminates. NY&nbsp;32 continues northward from this point on NY&nbsp;144's right-of-way, becoming South Pearl Street and immediately crossing Normans Kill to enter the city of [[Albany, New York|Albany]].<ref name="bing" />

==History==
The first piece of NY&nbsp;144 brought into the state highway system began with the portion of NY&nbsp;144 between [[Selkirk, New York|Selkirk]] and [[Greene County, New York|Greene County line]] as SH&nbsp;508. A {{convert|4.77|mi|km}} long stretch of highway, SH&nbsp;508 was to cost $41,000 (1907&nbsp;USD) to reconstruct to state standards. The contract was let on September 5, 1907 to the Elmore and Hamilton Contracting Company to put new limestone on the top course of the new roadway and approved stones for the bottom. Work commenced in June&nbsp;1908 and was completed three months later.<ref name=1909book>{{cite book|title=Annual Report of the State Engineer and Surveyor on the Canals of the State|publisher=The Engineer|page=147 (206)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SKk1AQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA207&ots=oMynb-2-Fp&dq=adamsville%20sandy%20hill%20ny%20road&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q=193&f=false|author=State of New York State Engineer and Surveyor|year=1909|accessdate=June 29, 2013|page=146}}</ref> 

Most of modern NY&nbsp;144 was originally designated as part of [[New York State Route 10|NY&nbsp;10]] when the first set of posted routes in [[New York]] were assigned in 1924. NY&nbsp;10 joined what is now NY&nbsp;144 at [[Coeymans (CDP), New York|Coeymans]] and followed it north through [[Bethlehem, New York|Bethlehem]] to [[Albany, New York|Albany]], where NY&nbsp;10 continued into the city on modern [[New York State Route 32|NY&nbsp;32]].<ref>{{cite news |title=New York's Main Highways Designated by Numbers |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 21, 1924 |page=XX9}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/NewYork/unitedstates1926ra_009.html |title=Rand McNally Auto Road Atlas (eastern New York) |publisher=[[Rand McNally and Company]] |year=1926 |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}</ref> When [[U.S. Highway]]s were first posted in New York in 1927, all of NY&nbsp;10 south of Albany became part of [[U.S. Route 9W|US&nbsp;9W]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Automobile Blue Book |publisher=Automobile Blue Book, Inc |location=Chicago |edition=1927 |year=1927 |volume=1}} This edition shows U.S. Routes as they were first officially signed in 1927.</ref> In the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]], US&nbsp;9W was realigned through the towns of [[New Baltimore, New York|New Baltimore]] and [[Coeymans, New York|Coeymans]] to use modern NY&nbsp;144 instead.
