The '''Jewish Museum Munich''' provides an overview of Munich<U+2019>s Jewish history and is part of the city's new Jewish Center located at Sankt-Jakobs-Platz in [[Munich]], [[Germany]]. It is situated between the main synagogue [[Ohel Jakob synagogue|Ohel Jakob]] and the Jewish Community Center which is home to the ''Jewish Community of Munich and Upper Bavaria'' and houses a public elementary school, a kindergarten, a youth center as well as a community auditorium and a [[kosher]] restaurant. The museum was built from 2004 until its inauguration on [[March 22]], [[2007]] and is run by the city of Munich.

== History ==
While there have been plans for a Jewish Museum dating back as far as 1928, the project did not gain significant momentum until the early 1980s when gallery owner Richard Grimm opened a private Jewish museum in a small space on [[Maximilianstrasse (Munich)|Maximilianstra<U+00DF>e]]. As the private collection gained popularity the need for a larger, public museum became apparent. However, Grimm's private museum closed after ten years for financial reasons and the Jewish community transferred the collection to a provisional exhibition space at Reichenbachstra<U+00DF>e 27 where the Museum of the City of Munich presented exhibitions and events in collaboration with the City Archives, until the spring of 2006. It was then decided to build a municipal Jewish Museum as part of the new Jewish Center at Sankt-Jakobs-Platz. <ref>[http://www.juedisches-museum.muenchen.de/cms/index.php?id=8&L=1 J<U+00FC>disches Museum M<U+00FC>nchen - About the museum]</ref>

== Building ==
The Jewish Museum Munich is part of a complex consisting of three buildings and was designed by architects Rena Wandel-Hoefer and Wolfgang Lorch who were awarded the contract after an architecture comptetion on July 6, 2001.<ref>[http://www.juedischeszentrumjakobsplatz.de/wettbewerbe.html .juedischeszentrumjakobsplatz.de] {{de icon}}</ref>.

The museum<U+2019>s permanent exhibition is located on the lower level. It cost about US$18 million to build with funding provided by the city of Munich.
