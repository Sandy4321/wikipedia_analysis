The '''20th Engineer Brigade (Airborne)''' is a [[combat engineer]] [[brigade]] assigned to the [[XVIII Airborne Corps]] of the [[United States Army]] stationed at [[Fort Bragg, North Carolina]].<ref>'''[http://www.armyengineer.com/unit_links.html Engineer Units]''', Army Engineer Association. Retrieved 02-03-2008</ref> As such, some of the units of the brigade are [[airborne forces|airborne qualified]], though the Airborne tab is merely a part of the [[Shoulder Sleeve Insignia|Unit patch]], so this is not necessarily always the case. Soldiers of the 20th Engineer Brigade provide various supportive duties to other Army units, including construction, engineering, and mechanical work on other Army projects.

Though its predecessor units have lineage that dates back before the [[American Civil War]], the unit was not formally designated as the 20th Engineer Brigade until 1950, the unit supported American forces for several years an a dozen campaigns of the [[Vietnam War]], but was deactivated shortly after American forces withdrew from the conflict. 

Reactivated in 1967, the unit has since seen numerous overseas tours, including to [[Kuwait]] during the [[Gulf war]], [[Kosovo]], [[Afghanistan]] during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], and [[Iraq]] during [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]], in support of its parent unit. It has also independently conducted various humanitarian missions in the United states and in other nations throughout the world.

==Organization==

The 20th Engineer Brigade currently consists of six engineer battalions headquartered throughout the eastern United States. The Brigade [[Headquarters and Headquarters Company]] (HHC) as well as the 27th Engineer Battalion (Combat)(Airborne), the 37th Engineer Battalion (Combat)(Airborne), and the 30th Engineer Battalion (Topographic) are all headquartered at [[Fort Bragg]],<ref name="Bragg">'''[http://www.bragg.army.mil/20eng/Pages/History.htm 20th Engineer Brigade History]''' 20th Engineer Brigade Staff. Retrieved 1-25-2008</ref> while the 19th Engineer Battalion (Construction Effects) is located at [[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]].<ref name="Bragg"/> The 326th Engineer Battalion (Combat) is located at [[Fort Campbell]], Kentucky,<ref name="Bragg"/> and the 7th Engineer Battalion (Combat) is located further to the north at [[Fort Drum]], [[New York]].<ref name="Bragg"/>

The insignia was originally authorized on 30 June 1967. It was amended on 14 January 1975 to add the blue and white "Airborne" tab.  The tab is part of the unit insignia and does not indicate whether an individual soldier is Airborne-qualified.  Parachute wings on an individual soldier indicate Airborne-qualification.  While the brigade headquarters was on jump status, some subordinate elements were not.<ref>'''[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Eng/20th%20Engineer%20Brigade.htm The Institute of Heraldry: 20th Engineer Brigade]''', The Institute of Heraldry.

==History==
[[Image:Robert B Flowers.jpg|thumb|left|[[Robert B. Flowers]], a former commander of the 20th Engineer Brigade, who later served as the [[Chief of Engineers]].]]
===Lineage===
The lineage and honors of the 20th Engineer Brigade date back to the [[American Civil War]].<ref name="Army"/> First designated as the [[Battalion]] of Engineers on [[August 3]], [[1861]], the battalion participated in 10 campaigns during the Civil War. Since that time, unit designations have changed many times as predecessors of the 20th Engineer Brigade have served in the [[Spanish-American War]], the [[Philippine-American War]], the [[Mexican Expedition]], [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Though it was not officially designated as the 20th Engineer Brigade during all of these wars, the Brigade received campaign participation credit for all of these campaigns, and has numerous [[campaign streamer]]s for what its previous incarnations did during these conflicts.

On [[August 16]], [[1950]] the brigade was first designated as the 20th Engineer Brigade and activated at [[Camp Leonard Wood]], [[Missouri]].<ref name="Army"/> It deployed overseas to [[France]] in November 1952 and established headquarters in [[Croix Chapeau]]. Comprising two battalions and six separate companies, the brigade provided engineer construction support to the Base Section of the [[European]] COMMZ in southwestern France. In August 1954, it redeployed back to the United States and was activated at [[Fort Bragg]], [[North Carolina]], on [[September 10]], [[1954]]. From that time until its inactivation on [[December 12]], [[1958]], the brigade provided engineer support to the [[XVIII Airborne Corps]].<ref name="Bragg"/>

===Vietnam War and aftermath===
In response to the build up of U.S. forces in the [[Republic of Vietnam]], the brigade headquarters was reactivated [[May 1]], [[1967]], at Fort Bragg and deployed to Vietnam in August 1967. During the Vietnam conflict, the brigade numbered over 13,000 officers and enlisted men organized into three engineer groups, with 14 battalions and 31 separate companies and detachments. One of these soldiers, [[Al Gore]], would later become [[Vice President of the United States]].<ref>'''[http://clinton1.nara.gov/White_House/EOP/OVP/html/Bio.html Biography of Vice President Al Gore]''', United States Government. Retrieved 1-25-2008</ref>

The brigade provided all non-divisional engineer support in Military Regions III and IV during eleven campaigns.<ref name="Bragg"/> Units cleared more than one-half million acres (2,000 km<U+00B2>) of jungle, paved 500 kilometers of highway, and constructed bridges totaling more than six miles (10 km) in length. As American forces were withdrawing from Vietnam, the brigade was inactivated September 20, 1971.<ref name="Army"/>

As the organization of the Army changed following Vietnam, the 20th Engineer Brigade was again reactivated at Fort Bragg, North Carolina as an [[airborne]] brigade on [[June 21]], [[1974]].<ref name="Bragg"/> Assigned as a subordinate command of the XVIII Airborne Corps, which comprised one airborne combat engineer battalion, a heavy construction battalion and four separate companies. Additionally, the [[283rd Engineer Detachment (Terrain Analysis)]] provided terrain intelligence needs of the brigade's mission.<ref name="Bragg"/> Since that time the brigade and its subordinate units supported the XVIII Airborne Corps, fulfilling critical combat engineer, construction, topographic, and bridging missions.<ref name="Army">'''[http://www.history.army.mil/lineage/branches/eng/0020enbde.htm United States Army Homepage: Lineage: Engineer Brigade]''' United States Army. Retrieved 1-25-2008</ref>

The Brigade participated in the recovery efforts following the [[Great Lakes Blizzard of 1977]]. Over 300 members of the unit were dispatched to [[New York State]] to help with recovery efforts.<ref name="Bragg"/> As requirements and the engineer force structure changed, the brigade inactivated the combat heavy battalion in 1987 and activated another combat airborne battalion. In 1989, the [[30th Engineer Battalion (Topographic)]] was added to the brigade.<ref name="Bragg"/> Over the years, the brigade has provided engineer support to XVIII Airborne Corps and other Army commands. In addition to training, it has deployed in support of operations across the entire spectrum of conflict from disaster relief to combat operations.<ref name="Bragg"/>

===Gulf War onwards===

Retrieved 02-03-2008</ref> The brigade completed 1,500 combat heavy battalions equivalent days of work constructing roads, airfields, heliports, ammunition/fuel/water storage points, life support areas and forward landing strips, distributed over ten million maps, trained over 5,000 coalition engineers, and supported the French attack on Assalman airfield. During follow-on missions the brigade destroyed over 6000 enemy bunkers and one million tons of munitions.<ref name="Bragg"/>

After the Gulf War, elements of the Brigade were dispatched to [[Haiti]] on a humanitarian mission. The 20th Engineer Brigade was assigned to construct base camps, improve the Haitian infrastructure, participate in humanitarian service projects, and assist with the reestablishment of public services, with a goal of improving overall quality of life within the country.<ref>'''[http://fas.org/irp/agency/army/mipb/1995-4/warshaw.htm Force Protection: Integrating Civil Affairs and Intelligence]''', Captain Lynda Snyder and Captain David P.
