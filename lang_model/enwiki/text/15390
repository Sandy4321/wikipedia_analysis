'''Henry Louis "Hank" Stram''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|s|t|r|<U+00E6>|m}}; January 3, 1923 &ndash; July 4, 2005) was an [[American football]] coach.  He is best known for his 15-year tenure with the [[American Football League]]'s [[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]]/[[Kansas City Chiefs]] and the Chiefs of the [[National Football League|NFL]].  Stram won three [[American Football League|AFL]] Championships (more than any other coach in the league's history) and [[Super Bowl IV]] with the Chiefs.  He also coached the most victories (87), had the most post-season appearances (6) and the best post-season record in the AFL (5&ndash;1). Stram is largely responsible for the introduction of [[Gatorade]] to the NFL due to his close association with [[Ray Graves]], coach at the University of Florida during Gatorade's development and infancy. Hank Stram never had an offensive coordinator, defensive coordinator, or special teams coach during his legendary career with the [[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]]/[[Kansas City Chiefs]].

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Stram was born '''Henry Louis Stram''' in [[Chicago]] in 1923. His Polish-born father, Henry Wilczek, wrestled professionally under the name Stram and the family name was changed accordingly. He later grew up in [[Gary, Indiana]], and graduated from [[Lew Wallace High School]] class of 1941.(The football stadium press box was renamed after him in his honor.) He earned seven letters playing football and baseball and joined the [[Sigma Chi]] Fraternity at [[Purdue]] in the 1940s, playing in 1942 and again in 1946 and 1947. Stram served in the US military during World War II interrupting his university career.

He was an assistant football coach for the [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Boilermaker]]s from 1948 to 1955 and the head baseball coach from 1951 to 1955. In 1996, Stram and [[Len Dawson]] were inducted into the Purdue Athletic Hall of Fame. After coaching at Purdue, Stram was an assistant at [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]], [[SMU Mustangs football|Southern Methodist University]], and [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]].

===Professional football coaching career (1960&ndash;1977)===
Stram was an innovator, a shrewd judge of talent, and an excellent teacher.  He helped develop [[Hall of Fame]]rs [[Len Dawson]], [[Bobby Bell]], [[Buck Buchanan]], [[Willie Lanier]], [[Jan Stenerud]] and many others like [[Johnny Robinson (safety)|Johnny Robinson]], [[Ed Budde]] and [[Otis Taylor (American football)|Otis Taylor]].  He was also the first coach in professional football to use [[Gatorade]] on his sidelines and run both the [[I formation]] and two-tight end offense, still used in professional football today.  On defense, the Chiefs employed a triple-stack defense, hiding the three linebackers behind defensive linemen.

He was considered a motivational genius, and his emphasis on the Chiefs' wearing of a [[Ten-year AFL patch|patch]] commemorating the AFL in Super Bowl IV was one of his typical ploys, extracting maximum effort from players who had been derided by proponents of the NFL. Stram was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 2003, ironically, nine years ''after'' [[Bud Grant]], the man whose team he had convincingly defeated in Super Bowl IV, had been enshrined.  At the Hall of Fame ceremonies, Stram was so weakened by the effects of [[diabetes]] that Len Dawson pushed his former coach onto the stage in a wheelchair. Stram's induction speech was then played from a previously recorded videotape.

Stram's contributions to the game, like those of other AFL pioneers, helped to change the face of professional football.

====Dallas Texans====
In 1959, [[Lamar Hunt]] recruited Stram to coach his Dallas Texans in the new AFL, which commenced play in [[1960 AFL season|1960]].  Hunt had previously been a bench player at SMU when Stram had been coaching there and the Texans' position had been turned down by [[Bud Wilkinson]] and [[Tom Landry]], then an assistant at the [[New York Giants]]. The Texans played their first game in the new AFL in September 1960 and proved to be successful from the beginning.

In 1962, the Texans won the AFL Western Division and the AFL championship. The Texans won the championship against the [[1962 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] 20-17 in what was the longest professional football championship game ever played. [[Tommy Brooker]] kicked a field goal after nearly 16 minutes of overtime to win the game for the Texans and stop the Oilers from winning their third straight title.

====Kansas City Chiefs====
The Dallas Texans became the Kansas City Chiefs in 1963 and continued their success. In 1966, they won the AFL title again on the back of one of the best defensive teams in the history of professional football featuring three hall-of-famers and eight all star players. The Chiefs defeated the [[1966 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] 31&ndash;7 in Buffalo. The Chiefs played the [[1966 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] in [[Super Bowl I]] with the Packers winning 35&ndash;10. Packers coach [[Vince Lombardi]] used a short passing game to overcome the Chiefs defense which proved successful with quarterback [[Bart Starr]] becoming the first Super Bowl MVP.

In a 1968 game against the [[1968 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] in Kansas City, the Chiefs entered the game without a healthy wide receiver ready to play.  Stram went in to pro football's past and resurrected the [[T formation]].  The Chiefs won the game 24-10 running the ball 60 times for over 300 yards while passing only three times for 16 yards.

The Kansas City Chiefs won the AFL championship again in 1969. In [[Super Bowl IV]], his ingenious innovations, the "moving pocket" and the "triple-stack defense", dominated the [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] on both sides of the ball.  In the Super Bowl, Stram became the first professional football coach to wear a [[wireless microphone|microphone]].  Stram's recorded comments from that game have become classics: ''"Just keep matriculatin' the ball down the field, boys."'', ''"How could all six of you miss that play?"'' ''"65 Toss Power Trap"'', ''"[[Karl Kassulke|Kassulke]] was running around there like it was a Chinese fire drill"'', and his assessment of the Vikings' ineffectual play: ''"You can't do that in OUR league!"''.  In the clip where he asks to a referee ''"How could all six of you miss that play?"'' the referee's response leads the confused Stram to mutter, ''"No.  What?"'' The Super Bowl victory was the second straight by a team from the AFL and added credibility to the newer league, which would complete a planned merger with the NFL the following season.

In 1971, the Chiefs won the [[American Football Conference West Division|AFC Western Division]] championship. The [[1971 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] defeated the Chiefs on Christmas Day 1971. The teams played the longest game in the history of professional football. After that, the Chiefs did not enjoy the same success, resulting in Stram leaving the franchise. Stram's tenure in Kansas City ended with a 35&ndash;15 loss at home to the same [[1974 Minnesota Vikings season|Viking]] team the Chiefs defeated in Super Bowl IV.

====New Orleans Saints====
Stram became the head coach of the [[New Orleans Saints]] in 1976, but posted losing records in his two seasons, 4&ndash;10 & 3&ndash;11. Hampering Stram's efforts to rebuild the typically pathetic Saints was a severe elbow injury to quarterback [[Archie Manning]], who missed the entire 1976 season and parts of the 1977 campaign. Stram also had to deal with continuous discipline problems caused by his leading rusher, [[Chuck Muncie]], who was in the early stages of a [[cocaine]] addiction which would lead to his trade in 1980 from New Orleans to the [[San Diego Chargers]].

Perhaps the biggest highlight of his New Orleans tenure was a 27&ndash;17 win over his former team, the [[1976 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], at [[Arrowhead Stadium]] in 1976, Stram's first victory with the Saints.  The 1977 campaign culminated in an historic home loss to the previously winless [[1977 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] who were riding a 26-game losing streak over two seasons. Stram took the loss hard; he burned the game film. He was fired after the final game of the season.

===Broadcasting career===
Following his retirement from coaching, Stram enjoyed a long and successful career as a [[color commentator]] on [[CBS Sports|CBS]]' [[NFL on CBS|television]] and [[NFL on Westwood One|radio]] broadcasts of NFL games. Stram began broadcasting games for CBS in [[1975 NFL season|1975]], originally calling games with [[Frank Glieber]]. After a brief hiatus so he could return to coaching, Stram returned to call games with [[Gary Bender]] in 1978. His other broadcast partners were [[Jack Buck]], [[Vin Scully]], [[Curt Gowdy]], [[Dick Stockton]], [[Tim Brant]], Steve Zabriskie, [[Sean McDonough]], and [[Jim Nantz]], along with various others.  From 1979 through 1989 he also called Tampa Bay Buccaneers preseason football games for WTOG-TV in Tampa, Florida.

As a broadcaster, he was best remembered for his near 20 year stint (beginning in [[1978 NFL season|1978]] and lasting through the [[1995 NFL season|1995 season]]) with Jack Buck on radio broadcasts of ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' games. Stram's key broadcasting trademark was his habit of predicting the next play before it happened.

On January 10, 1982, Stram, along with [[Vin Scully]], called the famous [[NFL playoffs, 1981-82#NFC: San Francisco 49ers 28.2C Dallas Cowboys 27|NFC Championship Game]] between the [[1981 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[1981 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]]. The game in question was immortalized by [[Dwight Clark]]'s [[The Catch (American football)|touchdown catch]] which elevated the 49ers into their first [[Super Bowl XVI|Super Bowl]] appearance (the first of four during the 1980s).

During a [[1988 NFL season|1988]] broadcasting trip to [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] for a [[1988 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]]&ndash;[[1988 Indianapolis Colts season|Colts]] game, Stram collapsed with a severely blocked aortic valve and underwent open heart surgery. He was hospitalized in Indianapolis for a week and later resumed his career with CBS.

He remained a part of CBS' television broadcast team until [[1993 NFL season|1993]]. His last game as a broadcaster was [[Super Bowl XXX]] for CBS Radio.

===Later life and death===
Stram made a guest appearance as himself on the TV show ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]''. In the episode, Stram was attending a coaching convention with fellow coaches [[Barry Switzer]] and [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]].  Hayden Fox, the fictional protagonist of the show, also attended the conference.

Hank Stram retired to [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], where he built a home in the town of [[Covington, Louisiana|Covington]].  He died at St. Tammany Parish hospital in Covington, from complications due to [[diabetes]], on July 4, 2005.
