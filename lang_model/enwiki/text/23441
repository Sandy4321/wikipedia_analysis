'''''Bloody Fun Day''''' is a [[puzzle video game|puzzle]] [[Flash game]] developed by Urban Squall and published by [[Kongregate]]. Players control one of a family of three [[Grim Reaper|grim reapers]] and are tasked with moving around an island of hexagonal tiles, killing creatures called Cuties in order to replenish their own life force. Cuties come in four colors, only those which are red restore life whereas the others charge special abilities that give the player more ways to kill further Cuties.

The game was initially developed as a demo by Urban Squall over an intensive five day development meeting in a [[San Diego]] hotel. The game's theme was inspired by the short story ''[[Everything Can Be Beaten]]'' by [[Jhonen Vasquez]], which features a monster which clubs animals to death and is unable to interact with them in any other way. Critics praised the game's concept, gameplay and addictiveness.

==Gameplay==
The game is [[turn based]], with players selecting one of a family of three grim reapers as their [[player character]] and starting the tutorial or selecting a game mode from either "5 Level Mode" or "Unlimited Mode". Players are presented with an island consisting of hexagonal tiles, each of which is occupied by a creature called a Cutie, with their chosen reaper present in the middle of the board armed with a scythe. The objective of the game is to earn the highest score possible before dying by killing Cuties.<ref name="indiegames">{{cite web| url = http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2009/03/browser_game_pick_bloody_fun_d.html| title = Browser Game Pick: Bloody Fun Day (Urbansquall)| author = Rose, Michael| publisher = [[Gamasutra|IndieGames.com]]| date = 2009-03-12| accessdate = 2009-03-20}}</ref>

Cuties come in four colors; red, black, blue and gold, when defeated they release a soul of the same color which is added to the player's stock. Red Cuties' souls replenish the player's life gauge. The other three colors fill special move buttons, of which there are six, allowing the player to use different attacks when the buttons are filled.<ref name="wired"/> When a new game is started, the player begins with 15 life points, one of which is expended each time the player moves to an adjoining tile. If the player's life points are depleted then their reaper dies, the player must slay as many red Cuties as possible in order to continue playing.<ref name="wired"/> In "5 Level Mode" play ends after the player completes the fifth level, in "Unlimited Mode" play continues until the player runs out of life energy.<ref name="jay"/>

When a player moves to a tile occupied by a Cutie, that creature is slain along with any other Cuties of the same color which are directly connected to that tile. Chains of Cuties can be slain in this fashion, producing several souls. Each tile the player moves to is drained of life, causing the grass to wither and preventing the player from moving back to it, any Cuties destroyed in a chain outside of the initial tile become eggs.<ref name="wired">{{cite web| url = http://blog.wired.com/games/2009/03/browser-game-bl.html| title = Browser Game: Bloody Fun Day, For The Sadist-Tactician| author = Ralph, Nate| publisher = ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''| date = 2009-03-19| accessdate = 2009-03-20}}</ref> After a set period of turns the eggs hatch into random Cuties which can again be harvested for souls, any tiles which have been drained due to the player's presence return to life and are furnished with an egg when existing eggs hatch.<ref name="jay"/> The result of this is that every tile the reaper travels on takes twice as long to spawn a new Cutie compared to tiles which housed a Cutie that was destroyed by a chain attack.<ref name="jay"/> Players move to the next game level after a certain amount of moves, every new level increases the time taken for eggs to hatch by a turn. Moving onto a tile containing an egg destroys the egg and incurs a small point deduction,<ref name="jay"/> but destroying a golden egg increases the player's score. A golden egg is produced whenever 10 or more Cuties are killed in a chain.

The left side of the game screen features a turn tracker, which is comprised of a number of notches which each represent a turn, markers are placed beside events such as level waypoints, egg hatching events and the turn which will result in game over should the player not harvest more red souls.<ref name="jay">{{cite web| url = http://jayisgames.com/archives/2009/03/bloody_fun_day.php| title = Bloody Fun Day| author = Psychotronic| publisher = [[Jay is Games]] | date = 2009-03-12| accessdate = 2009-03-20}}</ref> The 6 special abilities the player can charge with souls include the ability to kill any group of Cuties on the board, convert any adjacent group into red souls, and double the amount of souls obtained from any adjacent Cutie group.<ref name="vue"/>

==Development==
Initial development began in November 2008 when Urban Squall met in San Diego for their annual meeting, 2008's theme was 'a game in a week'. The team consisted of designer and programmer Andrew Pellerano, programmer Panayoti Haritatos, graphic designer Tim Wendorf and musician Nick Esposito. The developers hired two adjoining hotel rooms and opened the connecting door, allowing them to concentrate solely on creating the game over a period of five days, resulting in a demo. Pellerano spent further weeks updating the game during his spare time after which it was released to the public.<ref name="yay">{{cite web| url = http://yayitsandrew.com/2009/03/13/bloody-fun-day/| title = Bloody Fun Day| author = Pellerano, Andrew| publisher = YAY! it's Andrew!| date = 2009-03-13| accessdate = 2009-03-20}}</ref> During the weeks between the initial demo version and the game's release, Wendorf [[playtest]]ed the game and provided feedback on the number of souls needed to allow special abilities to be activated. The music track was created one night when Pellerano met Esposito in the latter's studio, during which Pellerano also voiced the sound effects resulting from Cuties being killed.<ref name="yay"/>

''Bloody Fun Day''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s theme was inspired by the short story ''Everything Can Be Beaten'' by Jhonen Vasquez.<ref name="yay"/> The story centres around a monster called It who spends his life in the confines of a single room, waiting in front of a chute which kittens are slid down. He crushes the kittens with a hammer. One day It decides to leave the room and encounters a world full of 'cute' animals. It responds by crushing the creatures, the only thing he is capable of doing.<ref name="yay"/>

==Reception==
''Bloody Fun Day'' received a positive response from video game critics. Psychotronic, reviewer for [[Jay is Games]], called it "an exceptionally well-crafted and deep game"<ref name="jay"/> and "refreshingly original",<ref name="jay"/> saying the developer "gets more interesting with every new title".<ref name="jay"/> [[Kotaku|Kotaku Australia]]'s David Wildgoose stated the game is "rather addictive".<ref name="kotaku">{{cite web| url = http://www.kotaku.com.au/games/2009/04/flash_fridays_bloody_fun_day.html| title = Flash Fridays: Bloody Fun Day| author = Wildgoose, David| publisher = [[Kotaku|Kotaku Australia]]| date = 2009-04-03| accessdate = 2009-04-16}}</ref> ''[[Vue Weekly]]'' writer Darren Zenko stated that the game is addictive, finding himself playing for more than 8 hours in a day.<ref name="vue">{{cite web| url = http://www.vueweekly.com/article.php?id=11406| title = Infinite Lives: Simple, hot and deep | author = Zenko, Darren| publisher = ''[[Vue Weekly]]''| date = 2009-03-26| accessdate = 2009-04-16}}</ref> Psychotronic disliked the lack of variety in levels, due to only one island shape being available and no enemies being present. He also highlighted the lack of special effects when using the reapers' abilities, since Cuties all die using the same animation regardless of whether they are killed with a reaper's scythe or a special ability. Despite this, Psychotronic praised the game's special abilities in terms of balance and interest, stating that the "three different families of powers support each other, making it feel like your efforts in one area can always be redirected to another."<ref name="jay"/>

''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' writer Nate Ralph found that "''Bloody Fun Day'' might not feature a deep or even logical narrative, but it's got style in spades, bolstered by simple, fun game mechanics."<ref name="wired"/> He added that the increased amount of turns needed to hatch eggs "can lead to some delightfully irritating close shaves."<ref name="wired"/> IndieGames.com writer Michael Rose agreed, stating "The game mechanics work really well and it's a very nice concept."<ref name="indiegames"/> Anthony Carboni, a former co-host of [[Attack of the Show!]] and current presenter of online video game review show Bytejacker, was also positive. In his review he said "It's a lot of fun and easy to pick up, but as levels progress things do get pretty intense."<ref name="byte">{{cite web| url = http://www.bytejacker.com/episodes/028| |title = 028 - Gradius Rebirth| author = Carboni, Anthony| publisher = Bytejacker| date = 2009-03-20| accessdate = 2009-03-25}}</ref> Zenko stated the game embodied three virtues; "simple, hot and deep".<ref name="vue"/> These virtues were required in games published by [[Electronic Arts]], which had been outlined to Zenko in a letter from Electronic Arts' founder [[Trip Hawkins]] after Zenko had written to Hawkins as a teenager.<ref name="vue"/> During play Zenko's reaper almost died due to a lack of red souls, but he managed to reverse the situation and fill the life bar; "even after all these years of gaming, that rush still does its neurochemical work".<ref name="vue"/>
