The '''Moors''' were the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Muslim]] inhabitants of the [[Maghreb]], [[Iberian Peninsula]], [[Sicily]] and [[Malta]]. Their descendants are presently known as the [[Maghrebis]].

The Moors invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 711 and called the territory [[Al-Andalus]], an area which at different times comprised [[Gibraltar]], most of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], and parts of [[Southern France]]. There was also a Moorish presence in what is now [[Southern Italy]], primarily in [[Sicily]]. They occupied [[Mazara del Vallo|Mazara]] on Sicily in 827<ref>{{cite web |title=Assessment of the status, development and diversification of fisheries-dependent communities: Mazara del Vallo Case study report |url= http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/documentation/studies/regional_social_economic_impacts/mazara_del_vallo_en.pdf |year= 2010 |publisher= [[European Commission]] |page = 2 |quote = ''In the year 827, Mazara was occupied by the Arabs, who made the city an important commercial harbour.

The religious difference of the Moorish Muslims led to a centuries-long conflict with the [[Christendom|Christian kingdoms of Europe]] called the [[Reconquista]]. The [[Fall of Granada]] in 1492 saw the end of the Muslim rule in Iberia.

Earlier, the [[Ancient Rome|Classical Romans]] interacted with (and later conquered) parts of [[Mauretania]], a state that covered northern portions of modern Morocco and much of north western and central [[Algeria]] during the classical period. The people of the region were noted in [[Classical literature]] as the ''[[Mauri (people)|Mauri]]''.

==Name==

===Etymology===
{{further|Mauri people|Mauretania}}

Isidore of Seville, writing in the seventh century claimed the Latin word Maurus was derived from the Greek mauron, which is the Greek word for black.<ref>Staying Roman: Conquest and identity in Africa and the Mediterranean,. Jonathan Conant, 2012 Cambridge University Press<Indeed, by the time Isidore of Seville came to write his Etymologies, the word Maurus or <U+2018>Moor<U+2019> had become an adjective in Latin, <U+2018>for the Greeks call black, mauron<U+2019>. "In Isidore<U+2019>s day, Moors were black by definition<U+2026><U+201D> (Staying Roman: Conquest and identity in Africa and the Mediterranean, 439-700. Jonathan Conant, 2012 Cambridge University Press.) /></ref>

===Modern meanings===
In the Medieval [[Romance language]]s (such as Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian, Romanian), the [[Latin]] word took such forms as ''mouro'', ''moro'', ''moir'', ''mor'' and ''maur''. From denoting a specific Berber people in western [[Ancient Libya|Libya]], the name acquired more general meaning in the Romance languages during the medieval period, partly developing a general meaning of "Muslim", partly (much like "[[Saracens]]") taking a religious meaning of "infidels" in the context of the [[Crusades]] and the [[Reconquista]].

Beside its usage in historical context, ''Moor'' and ''Moorish'' ([[Italian language|Italian]] and Spanish: ''moro'', [[French language|French]]: ''maure'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''mouro'', [[Romanian language|Romanian]]: ''maur'') is used to designate an ethnic group speaking the ''[[Hassaniya]]'' Arabic dialect. They inhabit [[Mauritania]] and parts of [[Algeria]], [[Western Sahara]], [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]], [[Niger]] and [[Mali]]. In Niger and Mali, these peoples are also known as the ''Azawagh Arabs'', after the [[Azawagh]] region of the Sahara.<ref>For an introduction to the culture of the ''Azawagh Arabs'', see Rebecca Popenoe, ''Feeding Desire <U+2014> Fatness, Beauty and Sexuality among a Saharan People''. Routledge, London (2003) ISBN 0-415-28096-6</ref>

In Spain, modern colloquial Spanish use of the term "Moro" is derogatory for [[Moroccans]] in particular<ref>{{cite book|last=Simms|first=Karl|title=Translating sensitive texts: linguistic aspects|year=1997|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-0260-9|page=144|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=t4y7EHgCn8kC&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Warwick Armstrong|first=James Anderson|title=Geopolitics of European Union enlargement: the fortress empire|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-33939-1|page=83|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0pmkrY29qkIC&dq}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wessendorf|first=Susanne|title=The multiculturalism backlash: European discourses, policies and practices|year=2010|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-55649-1|page=171|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wUaHVimJkT0C&dq}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Tariq Modood, Anna Triandafyllidou|first=Ricard Zapata-Barrero|title=Multiculturalism, Muslims and citizenship: a European approach|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-35515-5|page=143|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7OAAV5eEmy4C&dq}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Bekers|first=Elisabeth|title=Transcultural modernities: narrating Africa in Europe|year=2009|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-2538-7|page=14|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=N4_on188WJwC&dq}}</ref> and [[North African]]s in general.
Similarly, in modern, colloquial [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the term "Mouro" was primarily used as a designation for North Africans and secondarily as a derogatory and ironic term by northern [[Portuguese People|Portuguese]] to refer to the inhabitants of the southern parts of the country ([[Lisbon]], [[Alentejo]] and [[Algarve]]). However, this designation has gained more acceptance in the south.
 
In the [[Philippines]], a former [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colony]], many residents call the local Muslim population in the Southern islands ''Moros''. They also self-identify that way (see [[Muslim Filipino]]). The term was introduced by the Spanish colonizers. Within the context of [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonization]], in [[Sri Lanka]] ([[Portuguese Ceylon]]), Muslims of Arab origin are called ''Ceylon Moors'' not to be confused with "Indian Moors" of Sri Lanka (see [[Sri Lankan Moors]]).
[[File:Moritos.jpg|thumb|left|A performance of ''[[Moros y cristianos]]'' (Moors and Christians) in Mexico]]

''[[wikt:moreno|Moreno]]'' can mean ''dark-skinned'' in Spain, Portugal, and Brazil. Also in Spanish, ''morapio'' is a humorous name for "wine", especially that which has not been "baptized" or mixed with water, i.e., pure unadulterated wine. Among Spanish speakers, ''moro'' ("Moor") came to have a broader meaning, applied to both [[Moro (ethnic group)|Moro]]s of [[Mindanao]] in the [[Philippines]], and the [[morisco]]s of [[Granada]]. ''Moro'' is refers to all things dark, as in "Moor", ''moreno'', etc. It was used as a nickname; for instance, the [[Milan]]ese Duke [[Ludovico Sforza]] was called ''Il Moro'' because of his dark complexion.

In Portugal and Spain, ''mouro'' (feminine,'' moura'') may refer to supernatural beings known as [[Enchanted Moura|enchanted ''moura'']], where "moor" implies 'alien' and 'non-Christian'. These beings were siren-like fairies with golden or reddish hair and a fair face. They were believed to have magical properties.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=QA4vXSPmO3EC&oi=fnd&pg=PA16&dq=moura+encantada+rubios&ots=CgqouPRhzu&sig=3uihq_ZWUHv9guQpHPuM1hjWpBs#PPA18,M1pg18 Xos<U+00E9> Manuel Gonz<U+00E1>lez Reboredo, ''Leyendas Gallegas de Tradici<U+00F3>n Oral'' (Galician Legends of the Oral Tradition)], Galicia: Editorial Galaxia, 2004, p. 18, Googlebooks, accessed 12 Jul 2010 {{es icon}}</ref> From this root, the name moor is applied to unbaptized children, meaning not [[Christian]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=uQ88AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=PORTUGAL:+A+BOOK+OF+FOLK-WAYS#PPA77,M1 Rodney Gallop, ''Portugal: A Book of Folkways''], Cambridge University Press (CUP), 1936; reprint CUP Archives, 1961, Googlebooks, accessed 12 Jul 2010.</ref><ref>[http://www.csarmento.uminho.pt/docs/ndat/rg/RG100_11.pdf Francisco Martins Sarmento, "A Mourama"], in ''Revista de Guimaraes'', No. 100, 1990, Centro de Estudos de Patrim<U+00F3>nio, Universidade do Minho, accessed 12 Jul 2010 {{pt icon}}</ref> In [[Basque language|Basque]], ''[[mairu]]'' means moor and also refers to a mythical people.<ref>[http://www1.euskadi.net/morris/resultado.asp Euskadi.net] {{es icon}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}

Moors is used to identify [[Islam in Sri Lanka|Muslims in Sri Lanka]]. [[Sri Lankan Moors]] (combination of "Ceylon Moors" and "Indian Moors") are 12% of the population. The Ceylon Moors (unlike the Indian Moors) in Sri Lanka are descendants of Arab traders who settled there in the mid-6th century. When the Portuguese arrived in the early 16th century, they labelled all the Muslims in the island as Moors as they saw some of them resembling the Moors in North Africa. The Sri Lankan government to this day identifies the Muslims in Sri Lanka as "Sri Lankan Moors" sub-categorised into "Ceylon Moors" and "Indian Moors".<ref>[http://www.lankalibrary.com/cul/muslims/moors.htm A.

In 711 [[Common Era|CE]], the now Islamic Moors of [[Arab people|Arab]] and [[Berber people|Berber]] descent came from the [[North Africa]]n country of [[Morocco]] and crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] to get into the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and in a series of raids conquered [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Christian]] [[Hispania]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=wrMG-LfuU7oC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false Richard A Fletcher: Moorish Spain. 1992. page 1]</ref> Their [[general]], [[Tariq ibn-Ziyad]], brought most of Iberia under Islamic rule in an eight-year campaign.

The Moorish state fell into [[civil war|civil conflict]] in 739 that lasted until 743,  the conflict is known as the [[Berber Revolt]]. The Berbers revolted against the Arab aristocracy due to the oppression of them by the Arab ruling class. The Moors ruled in North Africa and in most of the [[Iberian peninsula]] for several centuries and the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] Arab aristocracy ruled all the way from [[Damascus]] to Spain.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Richard A.

He specifically says this about the Moor [[Caliphate of C<U+00F3>rdoba|C<U+00F3>rdoba]] rulers: {{quote|''All the Caliphs of the Banu Marwan (God have mercy on their souls!), and especially the sons of [[Abd-ar-Rahman III|al-Nasir]], were without variation or exception disposed by nature to prefer blondes.

As for [[Abd-ar-Rahman III|al-Nasir]] and [[Al-Hakam II|al-Hakam al-Mustansir]] (may God be pleased with them!), I have been informed by my late father, the vizier, as well as by others, that both of them were blond and blue-eyed. The same is true of [[Hisham II|Hisham al-Mu'aiyad]], Muhammad al-Mahdi, and `Abd al-Rahman al-Murtada (may God be merciful to them all!); I saw them myself many times, and had the honour of being received by them, and I remarked that they all had fair hair and blue eyes.<ref>Ibn Hazm, <U+0637><U+0648><U+0642> <U+0627><U+0644><U+062D><U+0645><U+0627><U+0645><U+0629></ref>''}} The language spoken in the parts of the Iberian Peninsula under Muslim rule was [[Andalusian Arabic]], a variety of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] language; the language became extinct after the [[Expulsion of the Moriscos]], but [[Arabic language influence on the Spanish language|Arabic influence]] can be found in the Spanish language of today.  The Muslims were resisted in parts of the Iberian Peninsula in areas of the northwest (such as [[Asturias]], where they were defeated at the battle of [[Covadonga]]) and the largely [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque regions]] in the Pyrenees. Though the number of Moor colonists was small, many [[Muladi|native Iberian inhabitants converted to Islam]]. According to Ronald Segal, by 1000, some 5 million of Iberia's 7 million inhabitants, most of them descended from indigenous Iberian converts, were Muslim. There were also [[Black people|Sub-Saharan Africans]] who had been absorbed into [[Al-Andalus]] to be used as soldiers and [[Arab slave trade|slaves]]. The [[Berber]] and [[Black people|Sub-Saharan African]] soldiers were known as "tangerines" because they were imported through [[Tangier]].<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Richard A.

In a process of decline, the Al Andalus had broken up into a number of Islamic-ruled [[fiefdoms]], or ''[[taifas]]'', which were partly consolidated under the [[Caliphate of C<U+00F3>rdoba]].

The [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]], a small northwestern Christian Iberian kingdom, initiated the Reconquista (the "reconquest") soon after the Islamic conquest in the 8th century. Christian states based in the north and west slowly extended their power over the rest of Iberia. [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]], [[Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n|Le<U+00F3>n]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Arag<U+00F3>n]], ''[[Marca Hispanica]]'', and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] began a process of expansion and internal consolidation during the next several centuries under the flag of [[Reconquista]].

[[File:Mohammed I ibn Nasr.jpg|thumb|[[Mohammed I ibn Nasr]] the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] Moor ruler of the [[Emirate of Granada]] embracing his Castilian ally, taken from [[Cantigas de Santa Maria]]]]
In 1212, a coalition of Christian kings under the leadership of [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] drove the Muslims from Central Iberia. The Portuguese side of the ''Reconquista'' ended in 1249 with the conquest of the [[Algarve]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] <U+0627><U+0644><U+063A><U+0631><U+0628> <U+2013> ''[[Al'Garb Al'Andalus|Al-Gharb]]'') under [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]]. He was the first Portuguese monarch to claim the title "[[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal and the Algarve]]".

The Moorish [[Kingdom of Granada]] continued for three more centuries in southern Iberia. On January 2, 1492, the leader of the last Muslim stronghold in [[Granada]] surrendered to armies of a recently united Christian Spain (after the marriage of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]], the [[Catholic Monarchs]]). They forced the remaining Jews to leave Spain, convert to Roman Catholic Christianity or be killed for not doing so. To exert social and religious control, in 1480, Isabella and Ferdinand agreed to allow the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition in Spain]]. Granada's Muslim population [[Morisco rebellions in Granada|rebelled in 1499]]. The revolt lasted until early 1501, giving the Castilian authorities an excuse to void the terms of the [[Treaty of Granada (1491)|Treaty of Granada]] (1491). In 1501 Castilian authorities delivered an ultimatum to Granada's Muslims: they could either convert to Christianity or be expelled.

The Inquisition was aimed mostly at Jews and Muslims who had overtly converted to Christianity but were thought to be practicing their faiths secretly. They were respectively called ''[[marrano]]s'' and ''[[morisco]]s''. However, in 1567 King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] directed Moriscos to give up their Arabic names and traditional dress, and prohibited the use of  the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] language. In reaction, there was a [[Morisco rebellions in Granada|Morisco uprising]] in the [[Alpujarras]] from 1568 to 1571. In the years from 1609 to 1614, the government expelled Moriscos. The historian Henri Lapeyre estimated that this affected 300,000 out of an estimated total of 8 million inhabitants.<ref>See ''History of [[Al-Andalus]]''.</ref> 

[[File:ChristianAndMuslimPlayingChess.JPG|thumb|190px|Christian and Moor playing chess, from ''The [[Book of Games]]'' of [[Alfonso X]], c. 1285]]
Many Muslims converted to Christianity and remained permanently in Iberia. This is indicated by a "high mean proportion of ancestry from North African (10.6%)" that "attests to a high level of religious conversion (whether voluntary or enforced), driven by historical episodes of social and religious intolerance, that ultimately led to the integration of descendants."<ref>[http://www.cell.com/AJHG/abstract/S0002-9297%2808%2900592-2 Adams et al., "The Genetic Legacy of Religious Diversity and Intolerance: Paternal Lineages of Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula"], ''Cell'', 2008. Quote: "Admixture analysis based on binary and Y-STR haplotypes indicates a high mean proportion of ancestry from North African (10.6%) ranging from zero in Gascony to 21.7% in Northwest Castile."</ref><ref>[http://www.upf.edu/enoticies/home_upf_en/1206.html Elena Bosch, "The religious conversions of Jews and Muslims have had a profound impact on the population of the Iberian Peninsula"], University of , 2008, Quote: "The study shows that religious conversions and the subsequent marriages between people of different lineage had a relevant impact on modern populations both in Spain, especially in the Balearic Islands, and in Portugal."</ref>

In the meantime, the tide of Islam had rolled not just to Iberia, but also eastward, through India, the [[Malayan peninsula]], and [[Indonesia]] up to the [[Philippines]]. This was one of the major islands of an [[archipelago]] which the Spaniards had reached during their voyages westward from the [[New World]]. By 1521, the ships of [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} had reached that island archipelago, which they named ''[[Philippines|Las Islas Filipinas]]'', after [[Philip II of Spain]]. In Mindanao, the Spaniards named the [[kris]]-bearing people as [[Moro people|Moros]] or 'Moors'. Today in the Philippines, this ethnic group of people in Mindanao, who are generally [[Filipino Muslim|Muslims]], are called 'Moros'. This identification of Islamic people as ''Moros'' persists in the modern [[Spanish language]] spoken in Spain, and as ''Mouros'' in the modern [[Portuguese language]]. See [[Reconquista]], and [[Maure]].

According to historian [[Richard A. Fletcher]],<ref>Richard Fletcher. ''Moorish Spain'' p. 10. University of California Press, 1993. ISBN 978-0-520-08496-4</ref> "the number of [[Arab]]s who settled in Iberia was very small. 'Moorish' Iberia does at least have the merit of reminding us that the bulk of the invaders and settlers were Moors, i.e., [[Berber people|Berbers]] from Algeria and Morocco."

The initial rule of the Moors in the Iberian peninsula under this [[Caliphate of C<U+00F3>rdoba]] is regarded as tolerant in its acceptance of Christians, Muslims and [[Jew]]s living in the same territories.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The Caliphate of C<U+00F3>rdoba collapsed in 1031 and the Islamic territory in Iberia fell under the rule of the [[Almohad dynasty]] in 1153. This second stage inaugurated an era of Moorish rulers guided by a version of Islam that left behind the tolerant practices of the past.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&letter=G&search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling, ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.</ref>

==Moors of Sicily==
{{See also|History of Islam in southern Italy|left|Arab-Norman culture}}
[[File:MuslimMusiciansAtTheCourtOfRoger.JPG|thumb|150px|Muslim musicians at the court of the Norman King [[Roger II of Sicily]]]]

The first Muslim conquest of Sicily and parts of southern Italy lasted 75 years (827<U+2013>902); the language spoken in Sicily under Muslim rule was [[Siculo-Arabic]]. By 827, Sicily was almost entirely in control of the [[Aghlabids]] with the exception of some minor strongholds in the rugged interior until 909 when it was then replaced by Shiite Fatimids. Four years later, the Fatimid governor was ousted from Palermo when the island declared its independence under Emir Ahmed ibn-Kohrob.

In 1038, a Byzantine army under George Maniaces crossed the strait of Messina. This included a corps of Normans which saved the situation in the first clash against the Muslims from Messina. After another decisive victory in the summer of 1040, Maniaces halted his march to lay siege to [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. Despite his conquest of the latter, Maniaces was removed from his position, and the subsequent Muslim counter-offensive reconquered all the cities captured by the Byzantines.

The Norman [[Robert Guiscard]], son of Tancred, invaded Sicily in 1060. The island was split between three Arab emirs, and the Christian population in many parts of the island rose up against the ruling Muslims. One year later, Messina fell, and in 1072, Palermo was taken by the Normans. The loss of the cities, each with a splendid harbor, dealt a severe blow to Muslim power on the island. Eventually all of Sicily was taken. In 1091, Noto in the southern tip of Sicily and the island of Malta, the last Arab strongholds, fell to the Christians.

Islamic authors would marvel at the tolerance of the [[Normans|Norman]] kings of Sicily. [[Ibn al-Athir]] wrote: "They [the Muslims] were treated kindly, and they were protected, even against the [[Franks]]. Because of that, they had great love for King Roger."<ref>{{cite book|last=Aub<U+00E9>|first=Pierre|title=Les empires normands d<U+2019>Orient|year=2006|publisher= Editions Perrin|page=168|isbn=2-262-02297-6}}</ref>

Many repressive measures were introduced by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] to please the popes who were intolerant of Islam in the heart of Christendom. This resulted in a rebellion by Sicilian Muslims, which in turn triggered organized resistance and systematic reprisals and marked the final chapter of Islam in Sicily. The Muslim problem characterized Hohenstaufen rule in Sicily under Henry VI and his son Frederick II. The complete eviction of Muslims and the annihilation of Islam in Sicily was completed by the late 1240s when the final deportations to [[Lucera]] took place.

Moorish architecture is the [[articulation (architecture)|articulated]] [[Islamic architecture]] of North Africa and parts of Spain and Portugal where the Moors were dominant between 711 and 1492. The best surviving examples are La [[Mezquita]] in [[C<U+00F3>rdoba, Spain|C<U+00F3>rdoba]] and the [[Alhambra]] palace in Granada (mainly 1338<U+2013>1390),<ref name="curl">Curl p. 502.</ref> and also the [[Giralda]] in Seville (1184).<ref name="Pev">Pevsner, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Architecture''.</ref> Other notable examples include the ruined palace city of [[Medina Azahara]] (936<U+2013>1010), the church (former mosque) San Cristo de la Luz in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], the [[Aljafer<U+00ED>a]] in [[Saragossa]] and baths at for example [[Ronda]] and [[Alhama de Granada]].

Armigers bearing moors or moors' heads may have adopted them for any of several reasons, to include symbolizing military victories in the [[Crusades]], as a pun on the bearer's name in the [[canting arms]] of Morese, Negri, Saraceni, etc., or in the case of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], possibly to demonstrate the reach of his empire.<ref name=VAM /> The [[Pope Benedict XVI#Arms|arms of Pope Benedict XVI]] feature a moor's head, crowned and collared red, in reference to the arms of [[Freising (district)|Freising, Germany]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html |author=Mons.

==Population==

Populations in Carthage circa 200 BC and northern Algeria 1500 BC were diverse.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} As a group, they plotted closest to the populations of Northern Egypt and intermediate to Northern Europeans and tropical Africans: "the data supported the comments from ancient authors observed by classicists: everything from fair-skinned blonds to peoples who were dark-skinned 'Ethiopian' or part Ethiopian in appearance."<ref>G. Mokhtar. ''General History of Africa: Ancient Civilizations of Africa'', p. 427.</ref> Modern evidence shows a similar diversity among present North Africans. Moreover, this diversity of phenotypes and peoples was probably due to ''[[in situ]]'' differentiation, not foreign influxes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Foreign influxes are thought to have had an impact on population make-up, but did not replace the indigenous Berber population.<ref>"Studies of ancient crania from northern Africa", ''American Journal of Physical Anthropology'', 83:35-48 (1990).</ref>
