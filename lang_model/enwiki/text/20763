'''''Misfits''''' is a [[compilation album]] of early songs from the American [[punk band]] the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]]. The compilation is officially titled ''Misfits'', but is commonly referred to as ''Collection I'' and was made up as the first half of a pair with the later release of the [[compilation album]] ''[[Collection II]]''. The album is also known as "Plan9" and listed in some catalogues as "Caroline Custom - Collection 1."{{Fact|date=January 2009}} It includes several versions of songs that are exclusive to this compilation.

==Album information==

"She" is the version which first appeared on ''[[Legacy of Brutality]]''.

"Hollywood Babylon" and "Bullet", from the ''[[Bullet (album)|Bullet EP]]'', vary only slightly from the [[Static Age]] LP.  The most noticeable difference is the "1,2,3,4" intro to "Bullet."

"Horror Business" and "Teenagers From Mars" are from the ''[[Horror Business]]'' EP.  This "Teenagers From Mars" is unique in that it retains the engineer's introduction from the original 7" that would be edited out of the version on the [[Box Set (The Misfits album)|Box Set]].  The one on the Box Set also fades out at the end.

"Where Eagles Dare" is from the ''Horror Business'' sessions and is a mix that was prepared for a proposed "Who Killed Marilyn?" 12" that never came out.  A similar mix, but without the "backwards feedback" intro and using heavy reverb, was included on ''Legacy of Brutality''.

"Night of the Living Dead", "Vampira", "Skulls" and "Astro Zombies" are alternate mixes of the tracks recorded during the ''[[3 Hits From Hell]]/[[12 Hits From Hell]]'' sessions.

"London Dungeon" and "Ghouls Night Out" are from the ''3 Hits From Hell'' EP.

"I Turned Into A Martian" is a different mix of the ''[[Walk Among Us]]'' track.

The remaining tracks are from the ''[[Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood]]'' and ''[[Die, Die My Darling]]'' releases.
