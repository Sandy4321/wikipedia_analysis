'''Mahendra Singh Dhoni''' or '''MS Dhoni''' {{audio|Mahendra Singh Dhoni.ogg|pronunciation}} ({{lang-hi|<U+092E><U+0939><U+0947><U+0928><U+094D><U+0926><U+094D><U+0930> <U+0938><U+093F><U+0902><U+0939> <U+0927><U+094B><U+0928><U+0940>}}) (born July 7, 1981 in Lavali Vilage [[Almora]], [[Uttarakhand]]) is an Indian [[cricket]]er and the current [[Captain (cricket)|captain]] of the Indian team. Initially recognized as an extravagantly flamboyant and destructive batsman, Dhoni has come to be regarded as one of the coolest heads to captain the Indian ODI side. Under his captaincy, India won the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]], [[2007-08 Commonwealth Bank Series|CB Series of 2007-08]] and IDEA Cup India-Sri Lanka ODI Series of 2008, the first ever bilateral ODI series win of India in Sri Lanka and The Border-Gavaskar trophy 2008 in which they beat Australia 2-0 thus letting India regain its spot at No.2 in world test rankings(fallen to No.3 after Sri lanka tour). Dhoni also recently captained the ODI team that beat England in the series 5-0.Dhoni is currently ranked the best ODI batsman in the world by the ICC. <ref>http://www.icc-cricketrankings.com/</ref> Mahendra Singh Dhoni was awarded the ODI Player of the Year award in 2008, the first Indian player to achieve this feat.

== Personal life ==
Mahendra Singh Dhoni was born in [[Ranchi]] [[Jharkhand]] to Pan Singh and Devaki Dev.<ref> {{citeweb|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/player/28081.html|title='Players and Officials|MS Dhoni'}}</ref> His paternal village Lvali is in the Lamgarha block of the [[Almora District]] of [[Uttarakhand]]. Dhoni's parents, moved from [[Uttarakhand]] to Ranchi where Pan Singh worked in junior management positions in [[MECON Limited|MECON]]. Dhoni has a sister Jayanti and a brother Narendra. Dhoni had long hair which he has now shortened; he cut it because he wanted to have a new look for advertiment purpose.<ref name="dhonipersonal">{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060429/saturday/main1.htm | title=Ranchi rocker | date=[[2006-04-29]] | publisher=[[The Tribune]] | accessdate=2007-05-12}}</ref> Dhoni is a fan of [[Adam Gilchrist]], and his childhood idols were cricket teammate [[Sachin Tendulkar]], [[Bollywood]] actor [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and singer [[Lata Mangeshkar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/245748.html| title=SAD, senility and nudes| date=[[2006-04-30]] | publisher=[[Cricinfo]] | accessdate=2007-05-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2006/08/05/stories/2006080501430400.htm| title=Besides mane matters... | date=[[2005-08-05]] | publisher=[[The Hindu]] | accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref>

Dhoni studied at [[DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Shyamali]], Ranchi,Jharkahnd where he initially excelled in [[badminton]] and [[association football|football]] and was selected at district and club level in these sports. Dhoni was a [[goalkeeper]] for his football team and was sent to play cricket for a local cricket club by his football coach. Though he had not played cricket, Dhoni impressed with his wicket-keeping skills and became the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando cricket club (1995 - 1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship and he performed well.<ref name="dhonipersonal">{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060429/saturday/main1.htm | title=Ranchi rocker | date=[[2006-04-29]] | publisher=[[The Tribune]] | accessdate=2007-05-12}}</ref> Dhoni focused on cricket after his 10<sup>th</sup> [[Education in India#Structure|standard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/208617.html | title='The cameras used to pass by, now they stop for me'| date=[[2005-05-04]] | publisher=[[Cricinfo]] | accessdate=2007-05-12}}</ref>

==Playing Style==
Dhoni is an aggressive right-handed [[batsman]] and [[wicket-keeper]]. Dhoni is one of a number of wicket-keepers who have come through the ranks of junior and India A cricket teams to represent the national team  &mdash; [[Parthiv Patel]], [[Ajay Ratra]] and [[Dinesh Karthik]] also followed this route. Dhoni, referred to as 'Mahi' by his friends, debuted in the [[Bihar cricket team]] during the 1998/99 cricket season and was selected to represent India-A for a tour to [[Kenyan cricket team|Kenya]] in 2004. Along with [[Gautam Gambhir]], Dhoni made multiple centuries against the Pakistan-A team in a tri-nation series and was selected in the Indian national team later in that year.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

Dhoni tends to play mostly from the back foot with a pronounced bottom hand grip.He has a very fast hand speed through the ball which often results in the ball racing across the ground. From this initial stance his feets do not show much movement which sometimes results in chasing balls while not coming to the pitch of the ball or inside edging a lot of balls.

Dhoni scored 148 against [[Pakistan cricket team|Pakistan]] in his fifth [[One Day International|ODI match]] in 2005 &mdash; then the highest score by an Indian wicketkeeper. Later in the year, he broke his own record as well as set the current world record for the highest score in the second innings in ODI matches as he scored 183* against [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lanka]]. Dhoni's success in the limited overs format secured him a place in the test team. Consistent performances in ODI cricket through the end of the 2005/06 season saw Dhoni briefly ranked as the No. 1 batsman in the [[ICC Cricket Ratings|ICC ODI ratings]].{{Fact|date=October 2008}} 

Dhoni's form dipped through 2006 as India lost matches at the [[ICC Champions trophy]], [[DLF Cup 2006-07|DLF Cup]], away bilateral series against [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] and [[South African cricket team|South Africa]]. A return to form in the home series against West Indies and SriLanka in early 2007 proved to be an inaccurate indicator of Dhoni's form as India crashed out of the first round in the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. Dhoni was out for a [[duck (cricket)|duck]] in both India's losses. After the World Cup, Dhoni won the [[Man_of_the_series#Cricket|Man of the series]] award in the bilateral ODI tournament against [[Bangladesh cricket team|Bangladesh]]. For the [[Indian cricket team in England in 2007|tour of England]], Dhoni was named the ODI team vice-captain.<ref name="DhoniVC">{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/tss/tss3020/stories/20070519011900400.htm | title=The poster boy comes of age |publisher=[[The Sportstar]]|date=[[2007-05-19]]|accessdate=2008-05-23}}</ref> 

As a batsman, Dhoni has shown the maturity to restrain his aggressive nature and play a responsible innings when the situation requires.<ref name="DhoniVC"/> Apart from traditional shots, Dhoni has two very unorthodox but effective cricket strokes. Since his entry into the Indian cricket team, Dhoni's aggressive batting style, success on the field, personality, and long hair have made him one of the most marketable cricketers in India.<ref name="Dhonibrands">{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/rsavind/content/story/297784.html| title=Brand Sehwag, Harbhajan and Munaf out for England tour| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] | date=[[2007-06-12]] | accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref><ref name="Dhoni2005">{{cite web|url=http://www.blonnet.com/2005/11/03/stories/2005110302000800.htm | title=It's Diwali for Dhoni as brands queue up for him  | publisher=[[The Hindu]] | date=[[2005-11-03]] | accessdate=2007-05-11}}</ref>

In the 2003/04 season, Dhoni scored a century (128*) against Assam in the first match of the Ranji ODI trophy. He was part of the [[East zone cricket team|East Zone]] squad that won the Deodhar Trophy for the year and contributed with 244 runs in 4 matches.

India scored 328 in 50 overs with Dhoni contributing 68 in their first match of 2006 against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]]. However the team finished poorly, scoring just 43 runs in the last eight overs and lost the match due to [[Duckworth-Lewis method]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usa.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005-06/IND_IN_PAK/SCORECARDS/IND_PAK_ODI1_06FEB2006.html|title=Scorecard - India v/s Pakistan 1<sup>st</sup> ODI 2005/06 season|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> In the third match of the series, Dhoni came in with India in a precarious situation and scored 72 runs off just 46 balls that included 13 boundaries to help India take a 2-1 lead in the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usa.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005-06/IND_IN_PAK/SCORECARDS/IND_PAK_ODI3_13FEB2006.html|title=Scorecard - India v/s Pakistan 3<sup>rd</sup> ODI 2005/06 season|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/tss/tss2907/stories/20060218010200400.htm|title=Dhoni's blitz tears Pakistan asunder |publisher=[[The Sportstar]]|date=[[2006-02-18]]|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> The final match of the series had a repeat performance as Dhoni scored 77 runs off 56 balls to enable India win the series 4-1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/237571.html|title=Scorecard - India v/s Pakistan 5<sup>th</sup> ODI 2005/06 season|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> In recognition of his consistent ODI performances, Dhoni overtook [[Ricky Ponting]] as number one in the [[LG ICC cricket ratings|ICC ODI rankings]] for batsmen on April 20, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/244910.html|title=Dhoni clinches top spot|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|date=[[2006-04-20]]|accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> His reign lasted just a week as [[Adam Gilchrist]]'s performance against [[Bangladesh cricket team|Bangladesh]] moved him to the top spot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/245696.html|title=Gilchrist replaces Dhoni at the top|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|date=[[2006-04-29]]|accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref>

Two canceled series in Sri Lanka, one due to the withdrawal of South Africa from the Unitech Cup due to security concerns<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/unitechcup/content/story/256635.html|title=South Africa to fly home|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|date=[[2006-08-16]]|accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> and the replacement 3-match ODI bilateral series against Sri Lanka washed due to rain,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/unitechcup/content/story/257035.html|title=India-Sri Lanka one-dayers canceled|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|date=[[2006-08-20]]|accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> was India's prelude to another disappointing tournament - [[DLF Cup 2006-07]]. Dhoni scored 43 runs as the team lost twice in three games and did not qualify for the finals. India's lack of preparation showed in the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy]] as they lost to [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] and [[Australia cricket team|Australia]], though Dhoni scored an half-century against West Indies. The story of the [[Indian cricket team in South Africa in 2006-07|ODI series]] in [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] was the same for both Dhoni and India as Dhoni scored 139 runs in 4 matches and India lost the series 4-0. From the start of the WI ODI series, Dhoni had played 16 matches, hit just two fifties and averaged 25.93. Dhoni received criticism on his wicket keeping technique from former wicketkeeper [[Syed Kirmani]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/269628.html|title=Kirmani stumped by Dhoni's wicket-keeping technique|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|date=[[2006-11-24]]|accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref>

Preparations for the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] improved as India recorded identical 3-1 victories over [[West Indian cricket team in India in 2006-07|West Indies]] and [[Sri Lankan cricket team in India in 2006-07|Sri Lanka]] and Dhoni had averages in excess of 100 in both these series. However, India unexpectedly crashed out the World Cup after losses to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Dhoni was out for a [[Duck (cricket)|duck]] in both these matches and scored 29 runs in the whole tournament. Dhoni put behind his disappointment in the World cup by scoring 91* against [[Indian cricket team in Bangladesh in 2007|Bangladesh]] after India were left in a tight spot earlier in the run-chase. Dhoni was declared the man of the match for his performance, his fourth in ODI cricket. He was also later adjudged the man of the series after the third game of the series was washed away. Dhoni had a good Afro-Asia Cup, getting 174 runs in 3 matches at an average of 87.00, with a blitzkrieg 139 not out of 97 balls, a Man Of The Match innings, in the 3rd ODI. 

Dhoni was nominated as the vice-captain of the ODI team for the series against South Africa in Ireland and the subsequent India-England 7-match ODI series.<ref name="DhoniVC">{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/tss/tss3020/stories/20070519011900400.htm | title=The poster boy comes of age |publisher=[[The Sportstar]]|date=[[2007-05-19]]|accessdate=2008-05-23}}</ref> Dhoni, who received a 'B' grade contract in December 2005, was awarded an 'A' grade contract in June 2007. And also he was elected as captain of Indian Twenty-20 Cricket Team for the World Twenty20 in September 2007. On 2 September 2007 Mahendra Singh Dhoni equalled his idol Adam Gilchrist's international record for the most dismissals in an innings in ODI by catching 5 English players and stumping one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/australia/content/current/story/298279.html|title=Indian board revises list of contracted players|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|date=[[2007-06-17]]|accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref>
He led India to the ICC World Twenty 20 trophy in South Africa with a victory over arch rivals Pakistan in an intensely fought final on 24 September 2007, and became the second Indian captain to have won a World cup in any form of cricket, after [[Kapil Dev]].

==Test career==
[[Image:Dhoni Test Graph.jpg|250px|thumb|Test Career of Dhoni. Brown line indicates 10 innings average while the orange line indicates career average progression]]
Following his good one-day form against Sri Lanka, Dhoni replaced [[Dinesh Karthik]] in December 2005 as the Indian Test wicket-keeper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/indvsl/content/story/226933.html|title=Ganguly included in Test squad|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|date=[[2005-11-23]]|accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref> Dhoni scored 30 runs in his debut match that was marred by rain. Dhoni came to the crease when the team was struggling at 109/5 and as wickets kept falling around him, he played an aggressive innings and was the last man dismissed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/indvsl/content/story/228619.html|title=Jayawardene and Vaas star in draw|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|date=[[2005-12-06]]|accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref> Dhoni made his maiden half-century in the second Test and his quick scoring rate (half century came off 51 balls) aided India to set a target of 436 and the Sri Lankans were bowled out for 247.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ind.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005-06/SL_IN_IND/SCORECARDS/SL_IND_T2_10-14DEC2005.html|title=Scorecard:India v/s Sri Lanka 2<sup>nd</sup> Test 2005/06 Season|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref>

India toured Pakistan in January/February 2006 and Dhoni scored his maiden century in the second Test at Faisalabad. India were left in a tight spot as Dhoni was joined by [[Irfan Pathan]] with the team still 107 away from avoiding follow-on. Dhoni played his typical aggressive innings as he scored his maiden test century in just 93 balls after scoring his first fifty in just 34 deliveries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/290806.html|title=Match Report - Pakistan v India, 2005-06 Second Test|publisher=[[Wisden Almanack]]|accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref>
[[Image:MS Dhoni fielding.jpg|thumb|Dhoni at fielding practice.]]
Dhoni followed his maiden test century with some prosaic batting performances over the next three matches, one against Pakistan that India lost and two against England that had India holding a 1-0 lead going into the test match. Dhoni was the top scorer in India's first innings in the third test at [[Wankhede Stadium]] as his 64 aided India post a respectable 279 in reply to England's 400. However Dhoni and the Indian fielders dropped too many catches and missed many dismissal chances including a key stumping opportunity of [[Andrew Flintoff]] (14).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/indveng/content/current/story/241557.html|title=Epidemic of dropped catches|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|date=[[2006-03-21]]|accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref> Dhoni failed to collect the [[Harbhajan Singh]] delivery cleanly as Flintoff went on to make 36 more runs as England set a target of 313 for the home team, a target that India were never in the reckoning. A batting collapse saw the team being dismissed for 100 and Dhoni scored just 5 runs and faced criticism for his wicket-keeping lapses as well as his shot selections.

On the [[Indian cricket team in West Indies in 2006|West Indies tour]], Dhoni scored a quick and aggressive 69 in the first Test at [[Antigua]]. The rest of the series was unremarkable for Dhoni as he scored 99 runs in the remaining 6 innings but his wicket-keeping skills improved and Dhoni finished the series with 13 catches and 4 [[stumped|stumpings]]. In the test series in South Africa, Dhoni's scores of 34 and 47 were not sufficient to save the second test against the Proteas as India lost the test series 2-1, squandering the chance to build on their first ever Test victory in South Africa (achieved in the first Test match). Dhoni's bruised hands ruled him out of the third test match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/rsavind/content/story/274667.html|title=Both teams in selection quandary|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|date=2007-01-01]]|accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref>

==Indian Premier League==
M.S.Dhoni was contracted by the [[Chennai Super Kings]] for 1.5 Million USD. This made him the most expensive player in the [[IPL]] Auctions which was closely followed by [[Andrew Symonds]]. Dhoni is the present captain of the [[Chennai Super Kings]] team.

==Controversies==
'''Walk-off''': On the fourth day of the first test match at [[Antigua Recreation Ground]], [[St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda|St John's]], [[Antigua]] during [[Indian cricket team in West Indies in 2006|India's tour of West Indies, 2006]], Dhoni's flick off [[Dave Mohammed]] to the midwicket region was caught by [[Daren Ganga]]. As the batsman started to walk back, captain Dravid declared the innings when confusion started as the umpires were not certain if the fielder stepped on the ropes and Dhoni stayed for the umpire's verdict. While the replays were inconclusive, the captain of the West Indies side, [[Brian Lara]], wanted Dhoni to walk-off based on the fielder's assertion of the catch. The impasse continued for more than 15 minutes and Lara's temper was on display with finger wagging against the umpires and snatching the ball from umpire [[Asad Rauf]]. Ultimately, Dhoni walked-off and Dravid's declaration was effected but the game was delayed, and Lara's action was criticized by the commentators and former players. Lara was called by the match referee for explanation of his actions but was not fined by the match referee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/wivind/content/story/249668.html | title='I think you should walk off', Lara told Dhoni | publisher=[[Cricinfo]] | date=[[2006-06-11]] | accessdate=2007-05-11}}</ref>

'''Home Vandalized''': After the loss to [[Bangladesh cricket team|Bangladesh]] in [[2007 Cricket World Cup]], the house that Dhoni was constructing in his home-town Ranchi was vandalized and damaged by political activists of [[Jharkhand Mukti Morcha|JMM]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/03/19/stories/2007031905830100.htm | title=Ire over Team India's defeat | publisher=[[The Hindu]] | date=[[2007-03-19]] | accessdate=2007-05-11}}</ref> The local police arranged for security for his family as India exited the World cup in the first round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://in.sports.yahoo.com/070319/43/6dh2e.html | title=Dhoni family's security worries Jharkhand MLAs | publisher=[[Yahoo]] | date=[[2007-03-19]] | accessdate=2007-05-11}}</ref>

==Captaincy Skills==
* Dhoni was recommended for captaincy by Sachin Tendulkar. In 2007, when Rahul Dravid resigned as Test and ODI captain, Sachin Tendulakar was offered captaincy by the board of selectors and Sharad Pawar, but Sachin politely refused and said, "Give it to someone like Dhoni".
* Team India went on to win the inaugural T20 cricket World Cup 2007
* First ever trilateral ODI series win in Australia versus Australia  and Sri Lanka [[2007-08 Commonwealth Bank Series|CB Series of 2007-08]].
* First ever bilateral ODI series win in Sri Lanka (IDEA CUP 2008). 
* He captained Team India to win the Border-Gavaskar Trophy  at home versus Australia. India went on to win the coveted 4 match Test series(2-0).
* Previous captains Anil Kumble and Sourav Ganguly have said that under Dhoni India will reach greater heights and even all time great Richard Hadlee said that "Under Dhoni,India will become the world no.1 team" and he also said that by this 2-0 win that the Australian dominance in the cricket world had finally come to an end.<ref>[Richard Hadlee's comments source 1 http://newsx.com/story/34243]</ref><ref>[Richard Hadlee's comments source 2 http://cricket.ndtv.com/cricket/ndtvcricket/cricketstory.aspx?id=SPOEN20080071758&site=ndtv]</ref>
* As a farewell gift to former Indian captain, [[Saurav Ganguly]] who was set to retire after the [[Nagpur]] test against Australia,  Dhoni asked [[Saurav Ganguly]] to lead the team for one last time towards the end of the Australian innings in the last test at Nagpur. <ref>[Former India captain Ganguly bids farewell in style]http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-36428820081110</ref>
* Dhoni has already been compared to Australia's [[Steve Waugh]] for his captaincy skills. In the battle of nerves, the mental toughness accompanied with the cool temperament exhibited by Dhoni just resembles the times of Steve Waugh<U+2019>s leadership.<ref>MAHENDRA SINGH DHONI - A LEADER INDEED (BUILT TOUGH) http://cricdigs.com/component/option,com_jd-wp/Itemid,19/p,951/</ref>

'''ODI Records''':
* On 31 October 2005 Dhoni scored 183* runs of just 145 balls against Sri Lanka in [[Sawai Mansingh Stadium]], [[Jaipur]]. The following is the list of records created during the innings.<ref name="Dhoni183records">{{cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/223803.html | title=Dhoni's day in the sun | date=[[2005-11-02]] | accessdate=2007-05-11}}</ref>
** The score of 183* is the highest in ODI cricket in the second innings (Earlier record: 153 by Lara). During the epic [[Australia in South Africa, 5th ODI, 2006|Aus-SA 2006 match]], [[Herschelle Gibbs]] came close to the record by scoring 175.
** The innings featured 10 Sixes, the most by an Indian in an Innings, and the second highest in ODI cricket (The highest is 11 by Sanath Jayasuriya and Shahid Afridi)
** He broke [[Adam Gilchrist]]'s record of 172 for the highest score made by a wicket keeper
** The innings set the record for the most number of runs scored in boundaries (120 - 15x4; 10x6) breaking the record held by [[Saeed Anwar]]. The record was broken by Herschelle Gibbs (126 runs in boundaries - 21x4; 7x6) against Australia during his knock of 175.
** In the same match, [[Kumar Sangakkara]] also made a century, making it the first match in which both wicket keepers scored a century
** The score of 183* equaled the record of the highest score against Sri Lanka in ODI cricket set by Ganguly during the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]].

* Among Indian batsmen who have played more than 50 matches, Dhoni has the second highest average.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/records/engine/records/batting/highest_career_batting_average.html?class=2;id=6;type=team | title=Highest averages: India - One-Day Internationals | accessdate=2007-05-11}}</ref> Dhoni's batting average is the highest amongst wicketkeeper in ODIs.

*In April 2006 Dhoni was briefly ranked No.1 in the ICC one day Batsmen's ratings.

*In June 2007, Dhoni(139*) and [[Mahela Jayawardene]](107)<ref name="team"/> set a new world record for the sixth wicket partnership of 218 runs against Africa XI during the Afro-Asia Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/ODIS/PARTNERSHIPS/ODI_PARTNERSHIP_RECORDS.html| title=ODIs - Partnership Records|accessdate=2007-06-11}}</ref>
