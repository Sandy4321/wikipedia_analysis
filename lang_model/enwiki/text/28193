'''The Lady in the Lake trial''' was a 2005 murder case in which '''Gordon Park''', (born [[1944]]) a retired teacher from [[Leece]], near [[Ulverston]], [[Cumbria]], was jailed for life for the murder of his first wife, '''Carol Park''', in 1976.

Carol Park went missing on [[July 17]], [[1976]], and was never seen alive again by her family. In 1997, her body was discovered at the bottom of [[Coniston Water]], and Gordon was arrested on suspicion of murder. The charges were subsequentally dropped. However, Gordon was arrested again, in 2004, and later found guilty of his wife's murder. The trial judge sentenced him to life imprisonment and recommended that he should serve a minimum of 15 years before being considered for parole. He is currently living at [[Strangeways]] prison and is expected to remain behind bars until at least [[2019]] and the age of 75.

The details of the murder are sketchy. However, Carol was killed by her face being smashed by a blunt object of some sort, alleged in court to have been an [[ice axe]]. She was then bound with rope, using complex knots, and weighed down with rocks and lead piping, before being thrown overboard from a boat on Coniston Water. The body had landed on an underwater ledge, meaning that it could be found. If it had landed a few metres further from the shore, it would probably have never been discovered.

There is a great deal of controversy surrounding the case. Gordon has received much support from his family and friends, and maintains his innocence. There was a large amount of local interest in the trial, as shown by the sales of the local paper, the [[North West Evening Mail]]. Some now claim that much of the evidence against him can be discounted. There have been vigils and petitions in attempts to free Gordon from prison and clear his name, and the case even featured prominently in the book ''No Smoke - The Shocking Truth About British Justice'', which outlined seven cases the author believed to be examples of innocent people being convicted of murder.

==The Lady in the Lake==
===Carol Park vanishes===
[[Image:Carol Park.jpg|thumb|left|Carol Park]]
On [[July 17]] [[1976]], Carol Park, who was thirty at the time, went missing. Gordon claimed that she had left home for another man, and, indeed, it would seem that their relationship was turbulent, with Carol having left their home in [[Leece]] twice before.<ref name="MurderUK">{{cite web |url=http://www.murderuk.com/individual/Park.htm |title=Gordon Park (The lady in the lake)|accessdate=2007-01-26 |format= HTML|work= MurderUK's murderers database}}</ref><ref name="BBC">{{cite news |title=Life for 'Lady in Lake' husband |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cumbria/4211495.stm|publisher=  BBC|date= [[2005]]-[[01-28]]|accessdate=2007-01-26 }}</ref> It was for this reason, Gordon claimed, that he did not report her missing for six weeks.<ref>{{cite news |title= Lake crime scene visited by jury|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cumbria/4164137.stm |publisher= BBC|date= [[2005]]-[[01-11]]|accessdate=2007-01-26 }}</ref> Carol was said to time her periods away from home to coincide with the school term. Gordon claimed that it wasn't until she didn't return in time to take up her job as a primary school teacher in September (the start of the school term) that he realised that there was a problem, and so reported her missing.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://freegordon.com/freegordon.html|title=Condensed Case Summary - Character of Carol Park|accessdate=2007-01-26 |last= Park|first= Jeremy|year= 2005|format= HTML|work= freegordon website|quote= Gordon believed she would return to her teaching post at the start of the new term in September.

However, Carol said she felt unwell and wanted to remain behind in bed. She was never seen alive again by her family.<ref name="Independent"/>

===Discovery of body and post mortem results===
Carol Park's body was found in 1997, wearing only a nightdress, 75 feet down at the bottom of [[Coniston Water]] by amateur divers, and brought to the surface by police divers on [[August 13]].<ref name="MurderUK"/> It was later reported that the body had landed on an underwater ledge, and had it been thrown into the water a metres farther from the land, it would probably never have been found.<ref name="BBC"/>

Details of Carol's death were revealed in the [[post mortem]]. There were severe injuries to the skull, and it was said that her face had been smashed by multiple blows.<ref name="MurderUK"/> The examination also revealed that the murder weapon had been an [[ice axe]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Life for 'Lady in Lake' killer|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/144/144378_life_for_lady_in_lake_killer.html |work= [[Manchester Evening News]]|date= [[2005]]-[[01-28]]|accessdate=2007-01-26 }}</ref> The body was found to be in a [[foetal]] position, which suggested that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before [[rigor mortis]] could settle in.<ref name="MurderUK"/> Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Parks' house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.<ref name="Scotsman"/>

===Gordon Park is arrested, but charges are dropped===
At the time of the discovery of the body, Gordon and his third wife, Jenny, were on a cycling holiday in France. They heard news of the discovery of the body, and are said to have seen footage of the police searching their house. On [[August 24]], they arrived home, and Gordon was arrested on suspicion of murder at 8.00am the next morning. He was charged with the murder of Carol Park, and remanded in [[Preston]] prison. However, after two weeks, his solicitors managed to persuade the court to grant him [[bail]].<ref name="InsideTime">{{cite web |url= http://www.insidetime.org/Dec06_Articles/boblake.htm|title= Suspect Evidence|accessdate=2007-01-26 |last= Woffinden|first= Bob|format= HTML|work= [[Inside Time]]}}</ref> On [[January 6]], [[1998]], the charges against Gordon were dropped due to lack of evidence.<ref name="Independent"/> The [[Crown Prosecution Service]] released a statement<ref name="Independent"/> saying- 
{{cquote|
After a conference with leading counsel and the police, a decision was taken, in agreement with all parties, that there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.}}

After the charges were dropped, Gordan said that he wished to 'try to put all this, including the events of 21 years ago, behind me and try to return to my everyday life'. However, the fact that the charges were dropped angered Carol's brother, Ivor Price, who said that he was disgusted by the way that Carol was portrayed in the trial, and talked of how Carol was not "someone who [was] cheap or had a string of lovers."<ref>{{cite news |first= Kate|last= Watson-Smyth|title= Lady in the Lake man tells of charge ordeal|url= http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19980108/ai_n9650236|work= The Independent|date= [[1998]]-[[01-08]]|accessdate=2007-01-26 }}</ref>

===Gordon Park's second arrest and trial===
{{wikinews|Man convicted of murdering wife 28 years ago}}
Gordon was again arrested on [[January 13]], [[2004]]. Police said at the time that the murder file had never been closed, and that the arrest followed new leads.<ref>{{cite news |first= Matt|last= Laddin|title= <U+2018>Lady in lake<U+2019> husband arrested
|url= http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2004/01/14/story270447320.asp|work= [[Irish Examiner]]|date= [[2004]]-[[01-14]]|accessdate=2007-01-26 }}</ref> These new leads were later reported to be a confession by Michael Wainwright, who claimed to have been a cell mate of Gordon's during his short prison stay in 1997. The police then revisited site where the body was discovered, and found a piece of [[Westmorland]] green [[slate]], a stone that matched the rocks that made up the wall of the family's bungalow.<ref name="Husband gets life">{{cite news |first= Helen|last= Carter|title= Husband gets life for Lady in Lake murder - 28 years ago|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/crime/article/0,2763,1401328,00.html?=rss|work= [[The Guardian]]|date= [[2005]]-[[01-29]]|accessdate=2007-01-26 }}</ref> The case was brought to trial at [[Manchester]] [[Crown Court]], and lasted ten weeks. There was no single piece of evidence that pointed to Gordon indisputedly, but the prosecution argued that when the evidence was placed together, it could only point at Park, and not a 'mysterious stranger or secret lover'. Primarily, the case for the prosecution rested on [[circumstantial evidence]], with the jury being asked to consider knots, rocks used to weight down the body and the ice axe, all linking Gordon Park to the crime.<ref name="Scotsman"/> However, the statements of Michael Wainwright, and another of Gordon's cell mates, who had learning difficulties, were also used as evidence by the prosecution.<ref name="Husband gets life"/> He was sentenced to be jailed for life, and told that he must serve at least 15 years. The judge said that he had taken into account the 'terrible concealment' of the body.<ref name="BBC"/>

The court found that Gordon had first put his hands around Carol's neck to [[strangle]] her, but that she had struggled. He then grabbed his ice axe, and brought it down with what was described as "considerable" force on Carol's face, and smashed the front right-hand side of her face, splitting open her head and smashing her teeth. He then did this again- the attack was described as consisting of "two big heavy, crushing blows" by [[pathology|pathologist]] Dr. Edwin Tapp. After this, Gordon dumped his wife's body in the lake, and went back to his day-to-day life.<ref name="unlikely">{{cite news |title= An unlikely killer|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/01/28/ulake2.xml&sSheet=/portal/2005/01/28/ixportaltop.html|publisher= [[The Daily Telegraph]]|date= [[2005]]-[[01-29]]|accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref>

==Case controversy==
===Support for Park===
[[Image:North West Evening Mail - Gordon Park special.jpg|thumb|right|The cover of one of the special edition ''[[North-West Evening Mail]]'' papers, about the trial.]]
There was much local interest in the matter, as was shown by the sales of the local paper, the ''[[North-West Evening Mail]]'', when it ran special editions on the case.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.newspapersoc.org.uk/Documents/Ed-excellence/Scoops/northwest-eve-mail.htm|title= 30 Years Of Coverage For Lady In The Lake|accessdate=2007-01-26 |date= [[2005]]-[[02-02]]|format= HTML|work= Newspaper Society's showcase of editorial excellence| publisher= Newspaper Society}}</ref> Park has maintained his innocence, and has received much support from his family and friends.<ref name="BBC"/> His children, Jeremy and Rachael, appointed a new legal team in an attempt to find grounds for [[appeal]]. Jeremy also set up a website called [http://freegordon.com/ freegordon] in a bid to raise awareness and support of the case for Gordon.<ref name="InsideTime"/> Notable individuals offering support include [[Tony Benn]], who has said that there is considerable doubt about Gordon's conviction, and that he will do all he can to help campaign for his freedom.<ref name="<U+00A3>5,000">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= <U+00A3>5,000 Reward to Free Gordon Park|url= http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/viewarticle.aspx?id=532403A|format= HTML|publisher= [[North West Evening Mail]]|date= 2007-08-16|accessdate=2007-08-16 }}</ref>

A year into Park's life sentence, around 40 family members and friends held a [[vigil]] at Strangeways Prison, in a bid to raise awareness of 'the fact that there is an innocent man in prison'.<ref name="Vigil"/> Another was held a year later, lead by Jenny Park.<ref>{{cite news |title= Family in Vigil for Lakes Killer|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cumbria/6305255.stm|format= HTML|publisher= BBC|date= 2007-01-21|accessdate= 2007-03-21}}</ref> Other fronts for the campaign include an offer of [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]5,000 for anyone providing evidence that leads to Gordon's freedom. Included in this are planned adverts in the [[North West Evening Mail]] and leaflets to 20,000 homes in the [[Furness]] area. However, this is being organised by George Harrison, with whom Gordon and his third wife Jennifer stayed during the trial. Jermey Park wrote to the North West Evening Mail to confirm that he wanted nothing to do with the reward, and that Harrison had no right to include his name, contact details or email address, or mention the freegordon website, in the adverts.<ref name="<U+00A3>5,000"/>

===Claims of flawed investigation===
The case was reported to be difficult for the prosecution, with the time between the murder and the trial making it extremely difficult to track potential witnesses. Keith Churchman, a police officer involved in the case, said that "the other difficulty was of course the body was taken away from the place where it was killed."<ref name="BBC"/> However, on top of the difficulties outlined by the police, the freegordon website<ref name="freegordon">{{cite web |url= http://freegordon.com/freegordon.html|title=Condensed Case Summary|accessdate=2007-01-26 |last= Park|first= Jeremy|year= 2005|format= HTML}}</ref> detailed a number of holes in the evidence. A story about the problems with the evidence was published in the [[Daily Mail]] on October 12, 2005, at the request of Jeremy, though it was not written by him.<ref name="Daily Mail">{{cite news |first= Bob|last= Woffinden|title=Dad DIDN'T kill Mum (the Lady in the Lake) |url= http://www.freegordon.com/pressarticledailymail141005.html|work= [[The Daily Mail]]|date= [[2005]]-[[10-14]]|accessdate=2007-01-26 }}</ref> Bob Woffenden, the author, late wrote an article for [[Inside Time]], in December 2006, talking about the trial and its controversies.<ref name="InsideTime"/> Another, similar article, pointing out holes in the evidence was published in the [[Sunday Herald]], on July 23, 2006.<ref name="Herald">{{cite news |first= Nick|last= Thorpe|title=Mystery of the Lady in the Lake |url= http://www.nickthorpe.co.uk/LadyLakeSundayHerald.htm|work= [[Sunday Herald]]|date= [[2006]]-[[07-23]]|accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref>

====Witnesses====
The first problem with the evidence is the use of 'jailhouse snitch' evidence, such as that from Michael Wainwright, described as "the most disreputable of all", despite the fact that it was one of the key pieces of evidence in the trial.<ref name="Daily Mail"/> Banks was described as "highly suggestible", frequently changed his story, and also claimed that Park had admitted to killing Carol while sailing to Blankpool. Wainwright, on the other hand, was a heavy [[cannabis]] smoker and admitted to hearing voices. He claims that Gordon said that he went upstairs, found Carol in bed with another man, and killed her in a fit of rage. This seemed unlikely, as the Parks lived in a [[bungalow]], and the supposed lover has never come forward.<ref name="Herald"/> It has also been said that Park had never actually met Wainwright.<ref name="Daily Mail"/>

Joan Young, who was the only first-hand witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming that she had seen someone push something over the side of a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, due to the fact that so much time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, he claims to have been reading his paper at the time. Also, it has been said that Young was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a [[Cruiser Yacht|cruiser]]. Despite the fact that Gordon owned a large [[yacht]] in 1997, in 1976, he owned a 505 racing [[dinghy]], which he sold later that year.<ref name="Daily Mail"/>

There are three witnesses who provide direct evidence supporting the idea that Park was innocent. The first, a neighbour, claims that they saw Carol at the bottom of her driveway. A second, another neighbour, claims that they saw an unidentified man in a [[Volkswagen Beetle]] in the Parks' drive for twenty minutes. The presence of the unidentified car has never been accounted for.<ref name="Daily Mail"/> Around 6pm that night, another witness, a woman who knew Carol, saw her at [[Charnock Richard services]]. She mentioned the fact that Carol had not greeted her to her husband, describing her as "snobby".<ref name="Herald"/>

====Other evidence====
The rock supposedly found in the lake, said to be taken from the Park's garden wall, has been challenged as evidence in multiple places. Both articles say that the police diver had no memory of recovering it, and he claimed that if he had found it, he would have placed it back. Professor Kenneth Pye, a defense witness, said that there was no evidence that the rock had ever been on the lake bed at all.<ref name="Daily Mail"/><ref name="Herald"/> The article in the Sunday Herald also claims that the policeman said to be responsible for finding the rock fainted when it was produced in court, offering no explanation, but still denying that he ever found it.<ref name="Herald"/>

Two more issues are addressed in the Sunday Herald article, but not in the Daily Mail article. The first is of the knots used to tie up Carol's body- the knots on Carol's body were mostly [[granny knot]]s, of which there was no evidence that Gordon ever used. The article also claims that the evidence of knots was irrelevant anyway, as climbers and yatchmen were so common in the area. The other piece of evidence related to another rock taken from the lakebed, which had supposedly come from the Parks' roof. However, the prosecution eventually admitted that Westmoreland green [[slate]] had been worked in the area for hundreds of years, and could have come from anywhere. The Herald also mentions the fact that the police files from the original missing persons enquiry into Carol Park had gone missing themselves, but does not draw any conclusions from this.<ref name="Herald"/>

Both articles address the issue of who the killer could alternatively have been, and both of them mention Carol's other lovers, and John Rapson, responsible for murdering Carol's sister. Both of the articles mention that he was in the Barrow area around the time of the murder, but both of them are careful to point out that they are not accusing him of being the murderer.<ref name="Herald"/><ref name="Daily Mail"/>

[George Harrison, described as a "freegordon.com campaigner"] "She [Sandra Lean] also highlights the sensationalist reporting and innuendo used by national newspapers and the media generally that resulted in effectively in character assassination and the view that the only person who could have murdered Carol was Gordon.}}</ref>
