Severe weather activity started during the afternoon of May 15 as a low pressure system crossed the area. The first tornado touchdowns were across the [[Midwest United States|Midwestern States]] including the two Iowa F5s that hit central and eastern parts of the state about 45 minutes apart during the late afternoon. Both tornadoes killed 18 in total. The first F5 tornado moved through five counties and 65 miles. It affected the town of [[Charles City, Iowa|Charles City]] just before 5 PM destroying much of the area. Damage figures were pegged at $30 million in Charles City alone while $1.5 million of damage was recorded elsewhere. This tornado killed 13 and injured 462 others. The second F5 tornado affected [[Fayette County, Iowa|Fayette]] and damaged or destroyed nearly 1000 homes. The hardest hit areas were [[Oelwein, Iowa|Oelwein]] and [[Maynard, Iowa|Maynard]] where homes were completely swept away from their foundations. 5 people were killed while 156 others were injured. Damage was estimated at $21 million. These were 2 of four F5 tornadoes across the country in 1968, the others being in southeastern Ohio on [[Wheelersburg, Ohio tornado outbreak|April 23]] and in southwestern Minnesota on June 13. The next and last official F5 tornado in Iowa took place in [[Jordan, Iowa|Jordan]] in 1976.

After the first tornadoes struck the Northern Plains, activity developed further south during the evening hours including several deadly tornadoes in Arkansas. One of the tornadoes touched down west of [[Jonesboro, Arkansas|Jonesboro]] before hitting the [[Craighead County, Arkansas|Craighead County]] city itself at around 10 PM CDT. The tornado which caught most residents by surprise since most of the warning systems failed and killed at least 34. <ref>http://library.thinkquest.org/C003603/english/tornadoes/casestudies.shtml</ref> One more person was killed in neighboring [[Jackson County, Arkansas|Jackson County]]. The tornado was the deadliest in Arkansas since an F4 tornado that affected [[White County, Arkansas|White County]] on March 21, 1952 killing 50. <ref>http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lzk/html/top25.htm</ref> <ref>[http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?p=3&s=6&d=asc&yr=%&mo=%&day=%&st=Arkansas&fu=%&co=Any&l=500&format=basic&submit=Table&dcom=&dpho=&dvid=&ddat=on&dtim=on&dsta=on&dfuj=on&dfat=on&dinj=on&dwid=&dlen=on&dcou=on&dong=&dare=&dfar=&drot=&ddam=&dpl=&dpw=&dtyp=&drem=&dtlat=&dtlon=&dllat=&dllon=&dstt=&dtor= Tornado History Project]</ref>

The same city was hit by another destructive tornado 5 years later killing at least three and injuring 250 others while leaving much more destruction throughout the city then the 1968 event. The damage figures were about $62 million in 1973 dollars. [http://comm.astate.edu/herald/archive/newsF98/0209tornado73.html]. Another F4 tornado just to the west of Jonesboro killed 7 in [[Oil Trough, Arkansas|Oil Trough]] [http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wmar01ap.htm] in [[Independence County, Arkansas|Independence County]] and 3 others were killed in [[Baxter County, Arkansas|Baxter County]].

The activity ceased across the [[Deep South]] when the final tornadoes of the first part of the outbreak touched down across the Metropolitan [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] area and northern [[Mississippi]] as well as in the [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] area. A smaller tornado outbreak from the same system took place across [[Oklahoma]] and [[Texas]] during the following day where 7 tornadoes touched down including an F3 in [[Wilbarger County, Texas]].

In addition to the 45 fatalities in Arkansas and 18 in Iowa, the outbreak killed 8 in [[Illinois]] and one in [[Indiana]].
