"'''Cape Feare'''" is the second episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 5)|fifth season]] of American animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It originally aired on the [[Fox network]] in the United States on October 7, 1993, and has since been featured on DVD and VHS releases. Written by [[Jon Vitti]] and directed by [[Rich Moore]], "Cape Feare" features the return of guest star [[Kelsey Grammer]] as [[Sideshow Bob]], who tries to kill [[Bart Simpson]] after getting out of jail. "Cape Feare" is a spoof of the 1962 film ''[[Cape Fear (1962 film)|Cape Fear]]'' and its [[Cape Fear (1991 film)|1991 remake]], and alludes to other horror films such as ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.

The episode was pitched by [[Wallace Wolodarsky]], who wanted to parody ''Cape Fear''. Originally produced for the [[The Simpsons (season 4)|fourth season]], it was held over to the fifth and was therefore the last episode produced by the show's original writers, most of whom subsequently left. The production crew found it difficult to stretch "Cape Feare" to the standard duration of half an hour, and consequently padded several scenes. In one such sequence, Sideshow Bob continually steps on rakes, the handles of which then hit him in the face; this scene became one of the show's most memorable moments. The episode is generally considered one of the best of the entire series, and the score received an [[Emmy Award]] nomination.

==Plot==
After receiving multiple death threats in the mail, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] becomes paranoid. It is revealed that the writer is Bart's enemy, [[Sideshow Bob]], who is incarcerated in [[Springfield (Simpsons)|Springfield]] State Prison. The next day, Sideshow Bob's parole hearing is held; Sideshow Bob swears that he is no threat to Bart, and is paroled. When the [[Simpson family]] goes to watch a film, Sideshow Bob sits in front of them. The Simpsons then realize that it was he who sent the letters, and they angrily demand him to stay away from them.

Despite their efforts, [[Clancy Wiggum|Chief Wiggum]] and the Simpson family are unable to protect Bart from Sideshow Bob. Sideshow Bob drives around Evergreen Terrace in an ice-cream truck, calling out the names of all the people whom he will not kill, unfortunately, Bart's name is not on that list. The Simpsons opt for the [[Witness Protection Program|Witness Relocation Program]] and move to Terror Lake, changing their surname to "Thompson" and settling in a houseboat. However, unknown to the family as they drive cross-country to their new home, Sideshow Bob has strapped himself to the underside of the car.

As the Simpsons arrive at Terror Lake and go inside their new houseboat, Sideshow Bob comes out from under the car. In doing so, he steps on the teeth of a number of rakes repeatedly, causing the rakes' handles to swing up and hit him in the face. At this point, Bob develops a hatred toward rakes. As Bart later walks down the road, he hears Sideshow Bob's voice and sees him escape from the underside of another car, only to be stepped on by a parade of elephants. Bart runs home and warns his parents about Sideshow Bob's presence.

During the night, Sideshow Bob reaches the houseboat and cuts it loose from the dock with his [[machete]]. Bob then ties up Homer, Marge, Lisa and Maggie up, so that they will not interfere with his plan. After tying up Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II as well, Bob enters Bart's room, ready to kill him. Bart escapes out the window and tries to hide from Sideshow Bob, but cannot jump off the boat, as there are crocodiles and electric eels in the water, and is cornered. As a "last request", he asks Sideshow Bob to sing the entire score to the ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' to stall for time as the houseboat floats to Springfield. After the performance, Bob advances on Bart again, but the boat runs aground, and Sideshow Bob is apprehended by the police. He is taken away, and the Simpsons return home. Abe Simpson, however, was not aware that they had moved and, without his pills, he ends up becoming a woman.

==Theme==
[[Image:Kelsey Grammer - Cropped.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A man wearing a cap smiles broadly.|[[Kelsey Grammer]] voiced Sideshow Bob in the episode.]]
Sideshow Bob is a recurring character on ''The Simpsons''. Since [[The Simpsons (season 3)|season three]]'s "[[Black Widower]]" (1992), the writers have echoed the premise of [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner]] from the 1949-1966 ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons by having Bob unexpectedly insert himself into Bart's life and attempt to kill him. Executive producer [[Al Jean]] has compared Bob's character to that of Wile E. Coyote, noting that both are intelligent, yet always foiled by what they perceive as an inferior intellect.<ref name="JeanBW">Jean, Al. (2003). Commentary for "Black Widower", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The scene in which Bob is stomped on by multiple elephants and bounced right back up is a reference to the Wile E. Coyote character.<ref name="jean"/>

In ''[[Planet Simpson]]'', author [[Chris Turner (author)|Chris Turner]] writes that Bob is built into a highbrow snob and conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] so that the writers can continually hit him with a rake and bring him down. He represents [[high culture]] while [[Krusty the Clown|Krusty]], one of his archenemies, represents [[low culture]], and Bart, stuck in between, always wins out.<ref name="Turner1">[[#Turner|Turner]], pp. 129<U+2013>131.</ref> In the book ''[[Leaving Springfield]]'', David L. G. Arnold comments that Bart is a product of a "mass-culture upbringing" and thus is Bob's enemy.<ref>[[#Arnold|Arnold]], pp. 2<U+2013>3.</ref>

Bob's intelligence serves him in many ways. During this episode, for example, the parole board asks Bob why he has a tattoo that says "Die Bart, Die". Bob replies that it is German for "The Bart, The"; members of the board are impressed by his reasoning.<ref name=A16/> Believing that "nobody who speaks German could be an evil man", they release him.<ref name="vitti"/> However, his love of high culture is sometimes used against him. In the same episode, Bob agrees to perform the operetta ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' in its entirety as a last request for Bart. The tactic stalls Bob long enough for the police to arrest him.<ref name=A16>[[#Arnold|Arnold]], p. 16.</ref>

==Production==
Even though the episode aired during the beginning of the fifth season, it was produced by the crew of the fourth season. A large part of the original crew left the show after season four to pursue new challenges. This led to the addition of several scenes, which normally would not have been considered, because the mentality of the departing crew was "what are they going to do, get us fired?"<ref name="vitti">Vitti, Jon. (2004). Commentary for "Cape Feare", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Although most of the episode was completed by the staff of season four, the end was rewritten by the team of season five.<ref name="jean">Jean, Al. (2004). Commentary for "Cape Feare", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref>

[[Wallace Wolodarsky]] had seen the 1991 version of ''[[Cape Fear (1991 film)|Cape Fear]]'' and pitched the idea of making a spoof of the film. [[Jon Vitti]] was then assigned to write a spoof of the [[Cape Fear (1962 film)|original ''Cape Fear'' film]] from 1962 as well as the remake. Instead of using the spoof as only a part of the episode, which could have contained a B-story, the entire episode was devoted to this parody. Sideshow Bob was cast as the villain and Bart became the main victim. The episode followed the same basic plot outline as the films and used elements from the original film's score by [[Bernard Herrmann]] (which was also used in the 1991 version), which, after this episode, became Sideshow Bob's theme.<ref name="jean"/> This episode marked the first time a Sideshow Bob episode was not a mystery.<ref name="vitti"/>

[[Image:Rake Joke.png|thumb|left|200px|alt=An animated character steps on a rake and the handle hits him in the face.|In the rake sequence, Sideshow Bob would step on nine rakes in a row in order to fill time.]]
There were difficulties getting this episode up to the minimum length of an episode and many scenes were added in post-production. The episode starts with a repeat of a [[couch gag]] that was first used in the episode "[[Lisa's First Word]]", which is considerably longer than the typical couch gag. The crew added an [[Itchy & Scratchy]] cartoon and a few misleads as to who was trying to kill Bart. Even with all of these additions, the episode still ran short of time. This led to the creation of the rake sequence, which became a memorable moment of the episode. Originally, Sideshow Bob was only supposed to step on one rake after he stepped out from the underside of the Simpson family's car, but this was changed to nine rakes in a row. According to executive producer Al Jean, the idea was to make the scene funny, then drag the joke out so that it is no longer funny, and then drag it out even longer to make it funny again.<ref name="jean"/>

Additions to the end musical number, including visual gags such as Bob appearing in uniform, were added after the [[animatics]]. The crew felt that watching the character singing would not be interesting enough and they had to include these gags to make it work.<ref name="jean"/> ''The Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]] was surprised when he saw the additions, because he originally thought they were silly and would not appear in the final cut, but he has grown to like them.<ref name="groening"/>

American actor [[Kelsey Grammer]] was brought in to guest star as Sideshow Bob for the third time.<ref name="book"/> At that time, Grammer had become a household name as the lead of the television series ''[[Frasier]]'', which was in production at the same time as this episode. Grammer did not know that the rake scene was extended, because he had only done the moan once and was surprised when he saw the final product. The show's writers admire Grammer's singing voice, and try to include a song for each appearance including this episode.<ref name="jean"/> [[Alf Clausen]], the primary composer for ''The Simpsons'', commented that "[Grammer] is so great. He's just amazing. You can tell he has this love of musical theater and he has the vocal instrument to go with it, so I know whatever I write is going to be sung the way I've heard it."<ref>{{Cite web|title=The man who makes 'The Simpsons' sing|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/09/20/simpsons.clausen/index.html|publisher=[[CNN|CNN Entertainment]]|author=Leopold, Todd|date=2007-09-21|accessdate=2009-01-03}}</ref>

Besides borrowing the overall plot structure of the ''Cape Fear'' films, the episode made several direct references to specific scenes from the films. References to the original include: [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] going to Chief Wiggum only to be told that Sideshow Bob has not broken any laws (also references the 1991 remake). References to the 1991 remake include: Sideshow Bob's tattoos; the shot of him leaving the prison gate; the scene with him smoking in the movie theater; part of his "workout" scene; his hiding under the Simpson family's car; Wiggum's rigging wire around the house to a toy doll as an alarm; his suggestion that Homer can do anything to someone who enters his home; Bob, strapped under a car, pulling up beside Bart for a conversation; and Homer's hiring a private investigator who attempts to persuade Bob to leave town.<ref name="jean"/>

The episode also contains elements of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1960 film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' with Sideshow Bob staying at Bates Motel.<ref name="book"/> Homer surprising Bart with his new hockey mask recalls the film ''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]''<ref name="BBC"/> and Sideshow Bob's tattoos on his knuckles are similar to those of [[Robert Mitchum]]'s character in ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (Mitchum also played the villain [[Max Cady]] in the original 1962 version of ''Cape Fear'').<ref name="totalfilm"/> Homer's hat and singing of "Three Little Maids From School Are We" from ''[[The Mikado]]'' during the car trip to Terror Lake alludes to ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.<ref name="jean"/>

IGN's Robert Canning gave the episode a perfect score of 10 out of 10 and named it the best Sideshow Bob episode of ''The Simpsons''. He added that there are "many, many reasons for its perfection, but what stands out most for me was how savage and single-minded Bob is in the episode. He wants to kill Bart and he makes no secret of it, save for lying to the parole board. Episodes since have made Bob far too wishy-washy.
