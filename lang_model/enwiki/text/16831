[[Image:British Empire 1897.jpg|thumb|400px|right|The British Empire in 1897, marked in pink, the traditional colour for Imperial British dominions on maps.]] 

The '''British Empire''' was the most [[World's largest empires|extensive empire]] in world history and for a substantial time was the foremost [[global power]]. It was a product of the European [[age of discovery]], which began with the maritime explorations of the [[15th century]], that sparked the era of the European [[colonial]] empires.
 
By 1921, the British Empire held sway over a population of about 458 million people, approximately one-quarter of the world's population.<ref>Angus Maddison. ''The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective'' (p. 98, 242). [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], Paris, 2001.</ref> It covered about 36.6 million km<U+00B2> (14.2 million square miles),<ref>Bruce R. Gordon. [http://www.hostkingdom.net/earthrul.html ''To Rule the Earth...''] (See [http://www.hostkingdom.net/Bibliography.html Bibliography] for sources used.)</ref> about a quarter of Earth's total land area. As a result, [[United Kingdom|British]] influence remains strong throughout the world, such as in [[Anglo-Saxon economy|economic practice]], [[Common law|legal]] and [[Westminster system|governmental]] systems, [[British Armed Forces|militarily]], [[society]], sports (such as [[cricket]] and [[Football (soccer)|football]]), [[educational]] systems, and the [[English language]] itself.

At the peak of its power, it was often said that "[[The empire on which the sun never sets|the sun never sets on the British Empire]]" because its span across the globe ensured that the sun was always shining on at least one of its numerous [[colonies]].<ref>However, it should be noted that this phrase had already been used a few centuries before by the king [[Charles I of Spain]], referring to the [[Spanish Empire]].</ref>
==Growth of the English Empire==
===Ireland===
The first substantial achievements of the colonial empire stem from the Act for Kingly Title, passed by the Irish parliament in 1541. This statute converted Ireland from a lordship under the authority of the English crown to a kingdom in its own right. It was the starting point for the [[Tudor re-conquest of Ireland]].{{Primarysources|date=March 2007}} 

By 1550 a committed policy of colonisation of the country had been adopted{{Fact|date=March 2007}}, which culminated in the Plantation of Ulster in 1610, following the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years war]] (1594-1603). In the meantime, the [[plantations of Ireland]] formed the templates{{Fact|date=March 2007}} for the empire, and several people involved in these projects also had a hand in the early colonisation of North America e.g. [[Humphrey Gilbert]], [[Walter Raleigh]], [[Francis Drake]] and [[Ralph Lane]].

===Stuart era===
In 1604, King [[James I of England]] negotiated the [[Treaty of London, 1604|Treaty of London]], ending hostilities with Spain, and the first permanent English settlement followed in 1607 at [[Jamestown, Virginia]]. During the next three centuries, England extended its influence overseas and consolidated its political development at home with the 1707  [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]], where the [[Parliament of England]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scots Parliament]] were united in [[Westminster]], London, as the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], in turn giving birth to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].

===Scottish role===
There were several pre-union attempts at creating a [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] overseas empire, with various Scottish settlements in [[Scottish colonization of the Americas|North]] and South America. [[Nova Scotia]] was perhaps Scotland's greatest opportunity at establishing a permanent presence in the Americas, but its most infamous{{Fact|date=March 2007}} was the ill fated [[Dari<U+00E9>n scheme]] which attempted to establish a settlement colony and trading post in [[Panama]] to foster trade between Scotland and the [[Far East]].

After the [[Acts of Union 1707]] many [[Scottish People|Scots]], especially in [[Canada]], [[Jamaica]], [[India]], [[Malaya]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], took up posts as administrators, doctors, lawyers, armed servicemen and teachers in what had become the new, or Second British Empire{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. Progressions in Scotland itself during the [[Scottish enlightenment]] led to advancements throughout the empire. Scots settled across the Empire as it developed and built up their own communities such as [[Dunedin]] in New Zealand. Large numbers of Scots settled in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, [[South Africa]] and [[Rhodesia]].

==Colonisation==
In [[1583]] Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]] claimed the island of [[Newfoundland]] for Elizabeth I. This reinforced John Cabot's prior claim to the island in [[1497]], for Henry VII, as England's first overseas colony. Gilbert's shipwreck prevented ensuing settlement in Newfoundland, other than the seasonal [[cod]] fishermen who had frequented the island since 1497. However, the Jamestown colonists, led by Captain [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]], overcame the severe privations of the winter in 1607 to found England's first permanent overseas settlement. The empire thus took shape during the early 17th century, with the English settlement of the [[13 colonies|eastern colonies]] of [[North America]], which would later become the original [[United States]] as well as [[Canada]]'s [[Atlantic provinces]], and the colonisation of the smaller islands of the [[Caribbean]] such as [[Saint Kitts]], [[Barbados]] and [[Jamaica]].

The sugar-producing colonies of the Caribbean, where [[slavery]] became central to the economy, were at first England's most important and lucrative colonies.<ref>{{cite book |last= James |first= Lawrence |title=The Rise and Fall of the British Empire |year=2001 |publisher=Abacus |pages=17}}</ref> The American colonies, which provided [[tobacco]], [[cotton]], and [[rice]] in the south and naval [[materiel]]<!-- This is not a misspelling. Follow the link to find out the difference between material and materiel --> and [[Fur trade|furs]] in the north, were less financially successful, but had large areas of good agricultural land and attracted far larger numbers of English emigrants.<ref>{{cite book| first=Ferguson |last =Niall |title=Empire |publisher=Penguin|year=2004|pages=72-73}}</ref>

[[Image:Benjamin West 005.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' by [[Benjamin West]].  The defeat of the French by Wolfe's forces foreshadowed British ascendancy in North America.]]

England's American empire was slowly expanded by war and colonisation, with England gaining control of [[New Amsterdam]] (later [[New York, New York|New York]]) via negotiations following the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|Second Anglo-Dutch War]]. The growing American colonies pressed ever westward as colonists sought new agricultural lands, a search that dispersed settlers across vast landmasses in North America.

During the [[Seven Years' War]] the British defeated the French at the [[Plains of Abraham]] and captured all of [[New France]] in 1760, giving Britain control over a great part of North America - principally what is now Canada and land east of the Mississippi. The British and Colonial victory over France in Seven Years War led to a stronger sense of security on the part of the North American colonies, as many colonists no longer felt the need for British protection following the ousting of the French from North America.<ref>''"[I Wonder] whether the neighborhood of the French to our North American colonies was not the greatest security for their dependence on the mother country, which I feel will be slighted by them when their apprehension of the French is removed"'' Lord Bedford, 1762[http://xenophongroup.com/mcjoynt/carphall.htm]</ref>

Later, settlement of [[Australia]] (starting with penal colonies from 1788) and [[New Zealand]] (under the crown from 1840) created a major zone of British migration. [[Matthew Flinders]] proved [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] and [[New South Wales]] to be a single land mass by completing a circumnavigation of it in 1803. His recommendation that the continent be known as Australia was accepted{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. In 1826 New Holland was formally claimed for Britain with the establishment of a military base, soon followed by a colony in 1829. The colonies later became [[self-governing colony|self-governing colonies]] and became profitable exporters of [[wool]] and [[gold]]. Some colonists also committed genocide against native populations, most notably in Tasmania.<ref>{{cite book| first=Ferguson |last =Niall |title=Empire |publisher=Penguin|year=2004|pages=109}}</ref>

==Free trade and "informal empire"==
{{See also|Pax Britannica}}

[[Image:Yorktown80.JPG|thumb|300px|''Surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown'' ([[John Trumbull]], 1797). The loss of the American colonies marked the end of the "first British Empire".]]

The old British colonial system began to decline in the 18th century. During the long period of unbroken [[British Whig Party|Whig]] dominance of domestic political life (1714&ndash;62), the Empire became less important and less well-regarded, until an ill-fated attempt (largely involving [[American Revolution|taxes, monopolies, and zoning]]) to reverse the resulting "salutary neglect" (or "benign neglect") provoked the [[American War of Independence]] (1775&ndash;83), depriving Britain of her most populous colonies, although British investment continued to play a major role in the United States economy until the First World War.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

The period is sometimes referred to as the end of the "first British Empire", indicating the shift of British expansion from the Americas in the 17th and 18th centuries to the "second British Empire" in Asia and later also Africa from the 18th century{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. The loss of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] showed that colonies were not necessarily particularly beneficial in economic terms, since Britain could still profit from trade with the ex-colonies without having to pay for their defence and administration{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

[[Mercantilism]], the economic doctrine of competition between nations for a finite amount of wealth which had characterised the first period of colonial expansion, now gave way in Britain and elsewhere to the ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic [[classical liberalism|liberalism]] of [[Adam Smith]] and successors like [[Richard Cobden]].

The lesson of Britain's North American loss &mdash; that trade might be profitable in the absence of [[colony|colonial]] rule &mdash; contributed to the extension in the 1840s and 1850s of [[self-governing colony]] status to white settler colonies in [[Canada]] and [[Australasia]] whose British or European inhabitants were seen as outposts of the "mother country". Ireland was treated differently because of its geographic proximity, and incorporated into the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1801, which was a result of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] against British rule. 

During this period, Britain also outlawed the [[slave trade]] (1807) and soon began enforcing this principle on other nations. By the mid-19th century Britain had largely eradicated the world slave trade. [[Slavery]] itself was abolished in the British colonies in 1834, though the phenomenon of [[indentured servant|indentured labour]] retained much of its oppressive character until 1920.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

The end of the old colonial and slave systems was accompanied by the adoption of [[free trade]], culminating in the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] and [[Navigation Acts]] in the 1840s. Free trade opened the British market to unfettered competition, stimulating reciprocal action by other countries during the middle quarters of the 19th century.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

[[Image:Sadler, Battle of Waterloo.jpg|thumb|350px|left|The [[Battle of Waterloo]] marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the beginning of the ''[[Pax Britannica]]''.]]

Some argue{{Fact|date=March 2007}} that the rise of free trade merely reflected Britain's economic position and was unconnected with any true philosophical conviction. Despite the earlier loss of 13 of Britain's [[British colonisation of the Americas|North American colonies]], the final defeat in [[Europe]] of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleonic]] [[France]] in 1815 left Britain the most successful international [[power (international)|power]]{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. While the [[Industrial Revolution]] at home gave her an unrivalled economic leadership{{Fact|date=March 2007}}, the [[Royal Navy]] dominated the seas{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. The distraction of rival powers by European matters enabled Britain to pursue a phase of expansion of her economic and political influence through "informal empire" underpinned by [[free trade]] and a strategic preeminence based on naval dominance{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

Between the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1815 and the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, Britain was the world's sole industrialised power{{Fact|date=March 2007}}, with over 30% of the global industrial output in 1870. As the "workshop of the world", Britain could produce finished manufactures so efficiently and cheaply that they could undersell comparable locally produced goods in foreign markets. Given stable political conditions in particular overseas markets, Britain could prosper through free trade alone without having to resort to formal rule. In the Americas the informal British trade empire was backed by the shared interests of Britain in the tenets of the United States' [[Monroe Doctrine]], which declared that the New World was no longer open to colonisation or political interference by Europeans.  As the United States did not yet have the military strength to enforce this doctrine, the British were largely left with a free hand to enter the new markets in Latin America created after independence from Spain and Portugal, and British commercial supremacy lasted until the outbreak of World War I.<ref>Britain and Latin America, Alan Knight, The Oxford History of the British Empire, Volume III</ref>

==British East India Company==
{{Main|British East India Company}}

The British East India Company was responsible for the annexation of most of the [[Indian subcontinent]] along with the conquest of [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and other surrounding Asian countries. These countries became large sources of revenue for the empire and by the nineteenth century Britain had become economically dependent on India.<ref>{{cite book |last= James |first= Lawrence |title=The Rise and Fall of the British Empire |year=2001 |publisher=Abacus |pages=219}}</ref>

The British East India Company originally began as a joint-stock company of traders and investors based in [[Leadenhall Street]], in the [[City of London]], which was granted a [[Royal Charter]] by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1600, with the intent to favour trade privileges in [[History of India|India]]. The Royal Charter effectively gave the newly created ''Honourable East India Company'' a monopoly on all trade with the [[East Indies]]. The Company transformed from a commercial trading venture to one which virtually ruled India as it acquired auxiliary governmental and military functions, along with a very large private army consisting of local Indian [[sepoys]], who were loyal to their British commanders and were an important factor in controlling the Company's Asian conquests.<ref>{{cite book |last= James |first= Lawrence |title=The Rise and Fall of the British Empire |year=2001 |publisher=Abacus |pages=222}}</ref> The British East India Company became one of the first [[multinational corporation]]s,<ref>The Company also had interests along the routes to India from [[Great Britain]]. As early as 1620, the company attempted to lay claim to the [[Table Mountain]] region in [[South Africa]]. Later it occupied and ruled [[St Helena]], colonised [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]], and earned the dubious distinction of having its products be the target of the [[Boston Tea Party]] in [[Thirteen Colonies|Colonial America]].</ref>  but its territorial holdings were subsumed by the British crown in 1858, in the aftermath of the events variously referred to as the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] or the [[Indian Mutiny]].

In 1615, Sir [[Thomas Roe]] was instructed by [[James I of England|James I]] to visit the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Mughal Emperor|Emperor]] [[Jahangir]] (who ruled over most of the [[Indian subcontinent]] at the time, along with [[Afghanistan]] and parts of eastern [[Iran|Persia]]). The purpose of this mission was to arrange for a commercial treaty which would give the Company exclusive rights to reside and build factories in [[Surat]] and other areas. In return, the Company offered to provide to the emperor goods and rarities from the European market. This mission was highly successful{{Fact|date=March 2007}} and Jahangir sent a letter to the King through Sir Thomas. The British East India Company found itself completely dominant{{Fact|date=March 2007}} over the French, Dutch and Portuguese trading companies in the [[Indian subcontinent]] as a result. In 1634, the Mughal emperor [[Shah Jahan]] extended his hospitality to the English traders to the region of [[Bengal]], which had the world's largest textile industry at the time. In 1717, the Mughal Emperor at the time completely waived customs duties for the trade, giving the Company a decided commercial advantage in the Indian trade. By the 1680s the Company's revenues were large enough that it was able to raise its own army, comprised mainly of indigenous Indian people who were placed under the command of British officers who were primarily English or Scottish.  Such Indian soldiers were called [[sepoys]].

===Expansion===
[[Image:Clive.jpg|250px|thumb|300px|[[Robert Clive]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]] established the Company as a military as well as a commercial power.]]The decline of the [[Mughal Empire]], which had separated into many smaller states controlled by local rulers who were often in conflict with one another, allowed the Company to expand its territories, which began in 1757, when the Company came into conflict with the [[Nawab]] of [[Bengal]], [[Siraj Ud Daulah]]. Under the leadership of [[Robert Clive]], the Company troops defeated the Nawab on [[23 June]] [[1757]] at the [[Battle of Plassey]], mostly because of the treachery of the Nawab's former army chief [[Mir Jafar]]. Mir Jafar's treachery turned the battle into a mere skirmish{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. This victory, which resulted in the virtual conquest of Bengal, established the British East India Company as both a military and commercial power.  However, the Company did not claim absolute authority over the territory for a long time. They preferred to rule through a puppet Nawab who could be blamed for the administrative failures caused by excessively avaricious economic exploitation of the territory by the Company. This event is widely regarded{{Fact|date=March 2007}} as the beginning of British rule in India. The wealth gained from the Bengal treasury allowed the Company to strengthen its military might significantly.  This army (comprised mostly of Indian soldiers, called [[sepoys]], and led by British officers) conquered most of India's geographic and political regions by the mid 19th century and thus the Company's territories were substantially augmented.

The Company fought many wars with local Indian rulers during its conquest of India, the most difficult being the four [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] (between 1766 and 1799) against the [[South India]]n [[Kingdom of Mysore]] ruled by [[Hyder Ali]], and later his son [[Tipu Sultan]] (''The Tiger of Mysore'') who developed the use of rockets in warfare.  Mysore was only defeated in the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] by the combined forces of Britain and of Mysore's neighbours, for which Hyder Ali and especially Tipu Sultan are remembered in India as legendary rulers{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. There were a number of other states which the Company could not conquer through military might, mostly in the North, where the Company's presence was ever increasing amidst the internal conflict and dubious offers of protection against one another. Coercive action, threats and diplomacy aided the Company in preventing the local rulers from putting up a united struggle against British rule{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.  By the 1850s the Company ruled over most of the Indian subcontinent and as a result, the Company began to function more as a [[state]] and less as a trading concern.

[[Image:reynolds.clive.750pix.jpg|thumb|250px|"Robert Clive and his family with an Indian maid", painted by [[Joshua Reynolds]], 1765.]]
The Company was also responsible{{Fact|date=March 2007}} for the [[opium trade]] with [[China]] against the [[Qing]] Emperor's will, which later led to the two [[Opium Wars]] (between 1834 and 1860). As a result of the Company's victory in the [[First Opium War]], it established [[Hong Kong]] as a British territory.  The Company also had a number of wars with other surrounding Asian countries, the most difficult probably being the three [[Anglo-Afghan Wars]] (between 1839 and 1919) against [[Afghanistan]], which were mostly unsuccessful from the British perspective{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

:''See: '''[[Company rule in India]]''' in the [[History of South Asia]] series for the history of the Company's rule in India between 1757 and 1857.''

===Collapse===
The Company's rule effectively came to an end exactly a century after its victory at Plassey.  During the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], the British faced their toughest military challenge during their rule in India. It occurred when the Company's Indian [[sepoy]]s rebelled against their British commanders. The rebellion began at [[Meerut]], a town east of [[Delhi]], when a few sepoys mutinied against their English officers and killed them. Then, the rebellion spread like wild fire over most of [[northern India]], especially the modern states of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Delhi]]. It immediately gained the support of almost every section of Indian society (except the westernized and educated Indians like [[Raja Rammohan Roy]] who believed that British rule was necessary to mitigate the social evils prevalent in Indian society at that time), most notably the [[zamindar]]s, peasants and Indian princes. The rebellion was a result of many factors, social, political and economical. By 1857, the inhabitants of India grew greatly dissatisfied with British rule, the character of which was perceived to be oppressive and exploitative by them. There was simmering discontent with British rule and only a spark was necessary to set it afire.<ref>http://www.amazon.co.uk/Indias-Struggle-Independence-India-Chandra/dp/0140107819</ref> One such event that surely seemed trivial to the Company at the time, but that turned out to have dire consequences, was the Company's introduction of the [[P53 Enfield|Pattern 1853 Enfield]] rifle. Its gunpowder containing paper cartridges were claimed to be lubricated with animal fat and had to be bitten open before the powder was poured into the muzzle.  Eating cow or pig fat was forbidden for religious reasons for the vast majority of the soldiers. Beef products were forbidden for the Hindu majority, likewise pork for the large Muslim minority.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} 

Although Company and Enfield representatives insisted that neither cow nor pig fat were being used, the rumour persisted and many sepoys refused to follow orders involving the use of the weapons using those particular cartridges.  Sepoy [[Mangal Pandey]] of 5th [[Company]], 34th [[Regiment]] of the [[Bengal Native Infantry]], who would later become a symbol of Indian resistance to British rule, was hanged on the 8th of [[April]] as a punishment for having attacked and injured British superiors at the introduction of the rifle increasing tension at a time when Indians had come to resent decades of British rule under which they felt like second class citizens; exploited and seen as incapable of [[Home Rule]]{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. 

In the past, Indians had feuded as much with other Indians as they did with the British. This has greatly aided the British in their conquest, for example, during The [[Battle of Plassey]] in which they benefited from the defection of the opposing army commander. There had yet to occur any sort of unified uprising against British authority. But in 1857, a number of events such as the Enfield cartridge issue catalysed the [[Indian Mutiny|Mutiny]] eventually bringing about the end of the [[British East India Company]]'s regime in India. Although Indians had achieved a great victory through common purpose in spite of sectional differences, their immediate situation turned for the worse{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. The British quickly suppressed the rebellion. Although this was a tough challenge considering that Indian sepoys vastly outnumbered their British officers, they could do it with relative ease for their organisation and communication was vastly superior to the Indians, who lacked the effective communication, organisation and weapons required to organise such a large scale rebellion against a powerful adversary. The rebellion came to a decisive end when the British finally took control of Delhi, which was the centre of the rebellion. The fall of Delhi was followed by a large scale massacre of the inhabitants of Delhi by British forces.<ref>http://www.amazon.com/Last-Mughal-Fall-Dynasty-Delhi/dp/1400043107/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-5007626-0839009?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1175433867&sr=8-1</ref>

The Company's failure to demonstrate effective control over its conquered Indian territories caused British financial and political entities to become uneasy about the security of their interests in India and what that meant for the future of the Empire. By 1857, India was a tremendously large part of the Empire's economy. The disaster of the Mutiny in particular had a tremendous influence on the Crown's policy regarding the most effective way to govern India{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. As a result, the Crown and British government assumed direct rule over the Indian sub-continent for 90 years following the dissolution of the Company.  

The period of direct rule in India is referred to as the [[British Raj|The Raj]] during which the nations now known as [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Myanmar]] were collectively known as [[British India]].

:''See '''[[British Raj]]''' in the [[History of South Asia]] series for the history of British rule in India between 1857 and 1947.''

==Breakdown of ''Pax Britannica''==
As the first country to industrialise, Britain had been able to draw on most of the accessible world for raw materials and markets. But this situation gradually deteriorated during the 19th century as other powers began to industrialise and sought to use the state to guarantee their markets and sources of supply. By the 1870s, British manufactures in the staple industries of the Industrial Revolution were beginning to experience real competition abroad{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

[[Image:britannia2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Britannia]] became a symbol of Britain's imperial might]]
Industrialisation progressed rapidly in [[Germany]] and the [[United States]], allowing them to catch up with the British economy as world leader. By 1870, the German textile and metal industries had surpassed those of Britain in organisation and technical efficiency and usurped British manufactures in the domestic market. By the turn of the century, the German metals and engineering industries would even be producing for the free trade market of the former "workshop of the world".{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

While invisible exports (banking, insurance and shipping services) kept Britain "out of the red," her share of world trade fell from a quarter in 1880 to a sixth in 1913{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. Britain was losing out not only in the markets of newly industrialising countries, but also against third-party competition in less-developed countries. Britain was even losing her former overwhelming dominance in trade with India, China, [[Latin America]], and the coasts of Africa{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

Britain's commercial difficulties deepened with the onset of the "[[Long Depression]]" of 1873&ndash;96, a prolonged period of price deflation punctuated by severe business downturns which added to pressure on governments to promote home industry, leading to the widespread abandonment of free trade among Europe's powers (in Germany from 1879 and in France from 1881).

The resulting limitation of both domestic markets and export opportunities led government and business leaders in Europe and later the US to see the solution in sheltered overseas markets united to the home country behind imperial tariff barriers: new overseas subjects would provide export markets free of foreign competition, while supplying cheap raw materials. Although she continued to adhere to free trade until [[1932]], Britain joined the renewed scramble for formal empire rather than allow areas under her influence to be seized by rivals.

==Britain and the New Imperialism==
{{Main|New Imperialism}}
[[Image:old_disraeli.jpg|left|framed|[[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]].]]

The policy and ideology of European colonial expansion between the 1870s and the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 are often characterised as the "New Imperialism"{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. The period is distinguished by an unprecedented pursuit of what has been termed "empire for empire's sake", aggressive competition for overseas territorial acquisitions and the emergence in colonising countries of doctrines of [[race|racial]] superiority which denied the fitness of subjugated peoples for self-government{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

During this period, Europe's powers added nearly 8,880,000 square miles (23,000,000 km<U+00B2>) to their overseas [[colony|colonial]] possessions{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. As it was mostly unoccupied by the [[western civilisation|Western]] powers as late as the [[1880s]], [[Africa]] became the primary target of the "new" imperialist expansion, although conquest took place also in other areas &mdash; notably [[south-east Asia]] and the [[East Asia]]n seaboard, where [[Japan]] joined the European powers' scramble for territory.

Britain's entry into the new imperial age is often dated to 1875, when the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]] bought the indebted [[Egypt]]ian ruler [[Ismail Pasha|Ismail's]] 44% shareholding  in the [[Suez Canal]] for <U+00A3>4 million to secure control of this strategic waterway, a channel for shipping between Britain and India since its opening six years earlier under Emperor [[Napoleon III]]. Joint Anglo-French financial control over Egypt ended in outright British occupation in 1882.

Fear of [[Russia]]'s centuries-old southward expansion was a further factor in British policy{{Fact|date=March 2007}}: in 1878 Britain took control of [[Cyprus]] as a base for action against a Russian attack on the [[Ottoman Empire]], after having taken part in the [[Crimean War]] 1854&ndash;56 and invading [[Afghanistan]] to forestall an increase in Russian influence there. Britain waged three bloody and unsuccessful wars in Afghanistan, as ferocious popular rebellions, invocations of [[jihad]] and inscrutable terrain frustrated British objectives{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. The [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] led to one of the most disastrous defeats of the Victorian military when an entire British army was wiped out by Russian-supplied Afghan [[Pashtun]] tribesmen during the 1842 retreat from Kabul. The [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] led to the British d<U+00E9>b<U+00E2>cle at the [[Battle of Maiwand]] in 1880, the siege of Kabul and British withdrawal into India. The [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1919 stoked a tribal uprising against the exhausted British military on the heels of World War I and expelled the British permanently from the new Afghan state. The "[[Great Game]]" in [[Inner Asia]] ended with a bloody British expedition against [[Tibet]] in 1903&ndash;04.

At the same time, some powerful industrial lobbies and government leaders in Britain, later exemplified by [[Joseph Chamberlain]], came to view formal empire as necessary to arrest Britain's relative decline in world markets. During the [[1890s]] Britain adopted the new policy wholeheartedly, quickly emerging as the front-runner in the scramble for tropical African territories{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

Britain's adoption of the New Imperialism may be seen as a quest for captive markets or fields for investment of surplus capital, or as a primarily strategic or pre-emptive attempt to protect existing trade links and to prevent the absorption of overseas markets into the increasingly closed imperial trading blocs of rival powers{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. The failure in the 1900s of Chamberlain's [[Tariff Reform League|Tariff Reform campaign]] for Imperial protection illustrates the strength of free trade feeling even in the face of loss of international market share. Historians have argued that Britain's adoption of the "New imperialism" was an effect of her relative decline in the world, rather than of strength{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

===British colonial policy ===
British colonial policy was always driven to a large extent by Britain's trading interests{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. While settler economies developed the infrastructure to support balanced development, some tropical African territories found themselves developed only as raw-material suppliers. British policies based on comparative advantage left many developing economies dangerously reliant on a single cash crop, which others exported to Britain or to overseas British settlements{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. A reliance upon the manipulation of conflict between ethnic, religious and racial identities, in order to keep subject populations from uniting against the occupying power <U+2014> the classic "[[divide and rule]]" strategy <U+2014> left a legacy of partition and/or inter-communal difficulties in areas as diverse as Ireland, India, Rhodesia, Cyprus, Sudan, and Uganda{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

==Britain and the scramble for Africa==
{{main|Scramble for Africa}}
[[Image:Punch_Rhodes_Colossus.png|thumb|205px|right|[[Cecil Rhodes]]- "the Colossus of Rhodes" spanning "Cape to Cairo".]]

In 1875 the two most important European holdings in Africa were French controlled [[Algeria]] and Britain's [[Cape Colony]]. By 1914 only [[Ethiopia]] and the republic of [[Liberia]] remained outside formal European control. The transition from an "informal empire" of control through economic dominance to direct control took the form of a "scramble" for territory by the nations of Europe. Britain tried not to play a part in this early scramble, being more of a trading empire rather than a colonial empire; however, it soon became clear it had to gain its own African empire to maintain the balance of power{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

As French, [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] activity in the lower [[Congo River]] region threatened to undermine orderly penetration of tropical Africa, the [[Berlin Conference, 1884-85|Berlin Conference]] of 1884&ndash;85 sought to regulate the competition between the powers by defining "effective occupation" as the criterion for international recognition of territorial claims, a formulation which necessitated routine recourse to armed force against indigenous states and peoples{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

Britain's 1882 military occupation of [[Egypt]] (itself triggered by concern over the [[Suez Canal) contributed to a preoccupation over securing control of the [[Nile]] valley, leading to the conquest of the neighbouring [[Sudan]] in 1896&ndash;98 and confrontation with a French military expedition at [[Fashoda Crisis|Fashoda]] (September 1898).

In 1899 Britain completed its takeover of what is today [[South Africa]]. This had begun with the annexation of the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]] in 1795 and continued with the conquest of the [[Boer Republics]] in the late 19th century, following the [[Second Boer War]]. [[Cecil Rhodes]] was the pioneer of British expansion north into Africa with his privately owned [[British South Africa Company]]. Rhodes expanded into the land north of South Africa and established [[Rhodesia]]. Rhodes' dream of a railway connecting [[Cape Town]] to [[Alexandria]] passing through a British Africa covering the continent is what led to his company's pressure on the government for further expansion into Africa.

British gains in southern and [[East Africa]] prompted Rhodes and [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Alfred Milner]], Britain's High Commissioner in South Africa, to urge a "Cape-to-[[Cairo]]" empire linking by rail the strategically important Canal to the mineral-rich South, though German occupation of [[Tanganyika]] prevented its realisation until the end of [[World War I]]. In 1903, the [[All Red Line]] telegraph system communicated with the major parts of the Empire.

Paradoxically, Britain, the staunch advocate of free trade, emerged in 1914 with not only the largest overseas empire thanks to its long-standing presence in India, but also the greatest gains in the "scramble for Africa", reflecting its advantageous position at its inception. Between 1885 and 1914 Britain took nearly 30% of Africa's population under its control, compared to 15% for France, 9% for Germany, 7% for Belgium and 1% for [[Italy]]: [[Nigeria]] alone contributed 15 million subjects, more than in the whole of [[French West Africa]] or the entire German colonial empire{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

==Home rule in white-settler colonies==
Britain's empire had already begun its transformation into the modern [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] with the extension of [[Dominion]] status to the already [[self-governing colony|self-governing colonies]] of [[Canada]] (1867), [[Australia]] (1901), [[New Zealand]] (1907), [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] (1907), and the newly-created [[Union of South Africa]] (1910). Leaders of the new states joined with British statesmen in periodic Colonial (from 1907, Imperial) [[Imperial Conferences|Conferences]], the first of which was held in [[London]] in 1887.

The foreign relations of the Dominions were still conducted through the Foreign Office of the [[United Kingdom]]: Canada created a Department of External Affairs in 1909, but diplomatic relations with other governments continued to be channelled through the Governors-General, Dominion High Commissioners in [[London]] (first appointed by Canada in 1880 and by Australia in 1910) and British legations abroad. Britain's declaration of war in [[World War I]] applied to all the Dominions.

But the Dominions did enjoy a substantial freedom in their adoption of foreign policy where this did not explicitly conflict with British interests: Canada's [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government negotiated a bilateral free-trade [[Canadian-American Reciprocity Treaty|Reciprocity Agreement]] with the United States in 1911, but went down to defeat by the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] opposition.

In defence, the Dominions' original treatment as part of a single imperial military and naval structure proved unsustainable as Britain faced new commitments in Europe and the challenge of an emerging [[German High Seas Fleet]] after 1900. In 1909 it was decided that the Dominions should have their own navies, reversing an 1887 agreement that the then Australasian colonies should contribute to the [[Royal Navy]] in return for the permanent stationing of a squadron in the region.

==The impact of the First World War==
[[Image:BritishEmpireWW1MemorialBrussel Copyright2004KaihsuTai.jpg|thumb|right|British Empire memorial for the First World War in the Brussels cathedral.]]

The aftermath of [[World War I]] saw the last major extension of British rule, with Britain gaining control through [[League of Nations Mandate]]s in [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[British Mandate of Iraq|Iraq]] after the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the Middle East, as well as in the former German colonies of [[Tanganyika]], South-West Africa (now [[Namibia]]) and [[New Guinea]] (the last two actually under South African and Australian rule respectively). The British zones of occupation in the German [[Rhineland]] after World War I and West Germany after World War II were not considered part of the Empire.

But although Britain emerged among the war's victors, and its rule expanded into new areas, the heavy costs of the war undermined its capacity to maintain the vast empire{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. The British had suffered millions of casualties and liquidated assets at an alarming rate, which led to debt accumulation, upending of capital markets and manpower deficiencies in the staffing of far-flung imperial posts in Asia and the African colonies{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. Nationalist sentiment grew in both old and new Imperial territories, fuelled by pride at Empire troops' participation in the war{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

The 1920s saw a rapid transformation of Dominion status. Although the Dominions had had no formal voice in declaring war in 1914, each was included separately among the signatories of the 1919 peace [[Treaty of Versailles]], which had been negotiated by a British-led united Empire delegation. In 1922 Dominion reluctance to support British military action against [[Turkey]] influenced Britain's decision to seek a compromise settlement. The League of Nations deputed former German colonies to come under the control of Britain's colonies. For example, New Zealand took over the mandate of Western Samoa, Australia that of Rabual and South Africa that of German South-West Africa.

Full Dominion independence was formalised in the 1926 [[Balfour Declaration 1926|Balfour Declaration]] and the 1931 [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]]: each Dominion was henceforth to be equal in status to Britain herself, free of British legislative interference and autonomous in international relations. The Dominions section created within the Colonial Office in [[1907]] was upgraded in 1925 to a separate Dominions Office and given its own Secretary of State in [[1930]].

[[Image:BritishEmpire1921.png|right|thumb|300px|Map showing British Empire in 1921 coloured pink.]]
[[Canada]] led the way, becoming the first Dominion to conclude an international treaty entirely independently (1923) and obtaining the appointment (1928) of a British High Commissioner in [[Ottawa]], thereby separating the administrative and diplomatic functions of the Governor-General and ending the latter's anomalous role as the representative of the head of state and of the British Government. Canada's first permanent diplomatic mission to a foreign country opened in [[Washington, DC]] in 1927: Australia followed in [[1940]].

[[Egypt]], formally independent from [[1922]] but bound to Britain by treaty until 1936 (and under partial occupation until 1956) similarly severed all constitutional links with Britain. [[Iraq]], which became a British Protectorate in 1922, also gained complete independence ten years later in 1932. 

===The end of British rule in Ireland===
[[Image:Warofindep.jpg|thumb|right|150px||A memorial to the [[Irish War of Independence]]]]

[[Irish home rule]] was to be provided under the [[Home Rule Act 1914]], but the onset of World War I delayed its implementation indefinitely. At Easter 1916 [[Easter Rising|an unsuccessful armed uprising]] was staged in Dublin by a mixed group of nationalists and socialists. From 1919 the [[Irish Republican Army]] fought a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against British rule. This [[Anglo-Irish War]] ended in 1921 with a stalemate and the signing of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]. The treaty confirmed the division of Ireland into two states, most of the island (26 [[Counties of Ireland|counties]]) became the [[Irish Free State]], a dominion within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], while the six counties in the north with a majority Protestant community remained a part of the United Kingdom as [[Northern Ireland]].  The Free State evolved into the [[Republic of Ireland]], which withdrew from the Commonwealth when [[Republic of Ireland Act|enacted in 1949]].  

[[Irish constitution|Ireland's Constitution]] claimed the six counties of Northern Ireland as a part of the Republic [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|until 1998]].  The issue of whether Northern Ireland should remain in the United Kingdom or join the Republic of Ireland has divided Northern Ireland's people and was a factor in a long and bloody conflict known as [[the Troubles]].  The [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998 brought about a ceasefire between most of the major organisations on both sides.

==Decolonisation and decline==
[[Image:Mohandas_Gandhi_resized_for_biography.jpg|left|thumb|100px|[[Mahatma Gandhi]], one of the leaders of the [[Indian independence movement]].]]
The rise of anti-colonial [[nationalism|nationalist]] movements in British colonies and the changing economic situation of the world in the first half of the 20th century challenged an imperial power now increasingly preoccupied with issues nearer home{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. The Empire's end began with the onset of the Second World War, when a deal was reached between the British government and the leaders of the [[Indian independence]] movement, whereby the Indians would co-operate and remain loyal during the war, after which they would be granted independence{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. India declared independence in August of 1947. Over the next two decades most of the former colonies would become independent.

===The Dominions===

Britain's efforts during [[World War II]] left the country all but exhausted and found its former allies disinclined to support the colonial ''status quo''{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.  Though Britain and its Empire emerged victorious from [[World War II]], the economic costs of the war were far greater than those of World War I.  Britain was heavily bombed and the [[tonnage war]] cost the Empire almost its entire merchant fleet{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. Britain's already weakened commercial and financial leadership were further undermined, heightening the importance of the Dominions and the [[United States]] as a source of military assistance{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

Britain's declaration of hostilities against Germany in September 1939 did not automatically commit the Dominions. All except Australia and Ireland issued their own declarations of war. The Irish Free State had negotiated the removal of the [[Royal Navy]] from the [[Treaty Ports (Ireland)|Treaty Ports]] the year before, and chose to remain [[Irish neutrality|legally neutral]] throughout [[The Emergency|the war]].  Australia went to war under the British declaration, though Australian prime minister [[John Curtin]]'s unprecedented action in 1942 of successfully demanding the recall for home service of Australian troops that had been earmarked for the defence of British-held [[Myanmar|Burma]] demonstrated that Dominion governments could no longer be expected to subordinate their own national interests to British strategic perspectives.

After the war, Australia and New Zealand joined with the United States in the [[ANZUS]] regional security treaty in 1951 (although the US repudiated its commitments to New Zealand following a 1985 dispute over port access for nuclear vessels). Britain's pursuit (from 1961) and attainment (1973) of [[European Community]] membership weakened the old commercial ties to the Dominions, ending their privileged access to the UK market.

In January of 1947, Canada became the first of the colonies to claim their nationals as citizens rather than British subjects. Canada became fully independent in 1982 with the patriation of a national constitution.

===India, Africa, Asia, the Pacific and the Carribbean===
[[Image:Subhas_Bose.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Subhash Chandra Bose|Netaji Subash Chandra Bose]] one of the most prominent leaders of the [[Indian Independence Movement]], being elected the president of the [[Indian National Congress]] for 2 consecutive terms. He formed the [[Azad Hind Government]] in exile, and regrouped and led the [[Indian National Army]] to battle against the allies during the [[World War II]].]]

Post-war economic crisis in 1947 made many realise that the [[The Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of [[Clement Attlee]] should abandon Britain's attempt to retain all of its overseas territories. The Empire was increasingly regarded as an unnecessary drain on public finances by politicians and civil servants, if not the general public{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

The independence of [[India]] in August [[1947]] ended a 40-year struggle by the [[Indian National Congress]], first for self-government and later for full sovereignty, though the land's partition into [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] entailed violence costing hundreds of thousands of lives. The acceptance by Britain, and the other Dominions, of India's adoption of republican status (1950) is now taken as the start of the modern Commonwealth. Owing to this declaration, 53 [[Commonwealth Republic]]s are now members of the Commonwealth.

In the Caribbean, Africa, Asia and the Pacific, post-war decolonisation was accomplished with almost unseemly haste in the face of increasingly powerful (and sometimes mutually conflicting) nationalist movements, with Britain rarely fighting to retain any territory{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. Britain's limitations were exposed to a humiliating degree by the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 in which the [[United States]] opposed British, [[France|French]] and [[Israel]]i intervention in Egypt, seeing it as a doomed adventure likely to jeopardise American interests in the [[Middle East]]{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

[[Singapore]] became independent in two stages. The British did not believe that Singapore would be large enough to defend itself against others alone. Therefore, Singapore was joined with [[Malaya]], [[Sarawak]] and [[North Borneo]] to form [[Malaysia]] upon independence from the Empire. This short-lived union was dissolved in 1965 when Singapore was expelled by [[Malaysia]] and achieved complete independence, although the United Kingdom continued to offer protection through the [[Five Power Defence Arrangements]].

[[Myanmar|Burma]] achieved independence (1948) outside the Commonwealth; Burma being the first colony to sever all ties with the British; [[Ceylon]] (1948) and [[Malaya]] (1957) within it. Britain's [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]] Mandate ended (1948) in withdrawal and open warfare between the territory's [[Jew]]ish and [[Arab]] populations. In the Mediterranean, a guerrilla war waged by [[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]] advocates of [[enosis|union]] with [[Greece]] ended (1960) in an independent [[Cyprus]], although Britain did retain two military bases - [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]].  The Mediterranean islands of [[Malta]] and [[Gozo]] achieved independence from Britain in [[1964]].

The end of Britain's Empire in Africa came with exceptional rapidity, often leaving the newly-independent states ill-equipped to deal with the challenges of sovereignty: [[Ghana]]'s independence (1957) after a ten-year nationalist political campaign was followed by that of [[Nigeria]] and [[Somaliland]] (1960), [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Tanganyika]] (1961), [[Uganda]] (1962), [[Kenya]] and [[Zanzibar]] (1963), [[The Gambia]] (1965), [[Lesotho]] (formerly Basutoland) (1966), [[Botswana]] (formerly Bechuanaland) (1967), and [[Swaziland]] (1968).

British withdrawal from the southern and eastern parts of Africa was complicated by the region's white settler populations: Kenya had already provided an example in the [[Mau Mau Uprising]] of violent conflict exacerbated by white landownership and reluctance to concede majority rule{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. White minority rule in [[South Africa]] remained a source of bitterness within the Commonwealth until the [[Union of South Africa]] left the Commonwealth in 1961.

Although the white-dominated [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] ended in the independence of [[Malawi]] (formerly [[Nyasaland]]) and [[Zambia]] (the former [[Northern Rhodesia]]) in 1964, [[Southern Rhodesia]]'s white minority (a [[self-governing colony]] since 1923) declared independence with their [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|UDI]] rather than submit to the immediate majority rule of [[black African]]s. The support of South Africa's apartheid government, and the Portuguese rule of [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] helped support the Rhodesian regime until 1979, when agreement was reached on majority rule, ending the [[Rhodesian Bush War]] and creating the new nation of [[Zimbabwe]].

Most of Britain's Caribbean territories opted for eventual separate independence after the failure of the [[West Indies Federation]] (1958&ndash;62): [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] (1962) were followed into statehood by [[Barbados]] (1966) and the smaller islands of the eastern Caribbean (1970s and 1980s).  Britain's last colony on the American mainland, [[British Honduras]], became a self-governing colony in 1964 and was renamed Belize on 1 June 1973, achieving full independence in 1981.

[[Image:The empire strikes back newsweek.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Newsweek magazine, April 19, 1982.]]

The [[British Western Pacific Territories]] such as the [[Gilbert Islands]] (which had seen the last attempt at human colonisation within the Empire - the [[Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme]]) underwent a similar process of decolonisation.

As decolonisation and the [[Cold War]] were gathering momentum during the 1950s, an uninhabited rock in the Atlantic Ocean, [[Rockall]], became the last territorial acquisition of the United Kingdom.  Concerns that the [[Soviet Union]] might use the island to spy on a British missile test {{PDFlink|[http://www.sages.unimelb.edu.au/staff/pdf/Rockall.pdf]|396&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 406296 bytes -->}} prompted the [[Royal Navy]] to land a party and officially claim the rock in the name of the Queen in 1955. In 1972 the [[Isle of Rockall Act 1972|Isle of Rockall Act]] formally incorporated the island into the United Kingdom.

In [[1982]], Britain's resolve to defend her remaining overseas territories was put to the test when [[Argentina]] invaded the [[Falkland Islands]], acting on a long-standing claim that dated back to the [[Spanish Empire]]. Britain's ultimately successful military response to liberate the islands during the ensuing [[Falklands War]] prompted headlines in the US press that "the Empire strikes back", and was viewed by many to have contributed to reversing the downward trend in the UK's status as a [[Major power|world power]].<ref> Lawrence James, The Rise and Fall of the British Empire (Abacus, 1994), p629</ref>

In [[1984]], Britain ended the protectorate status of [[Brunei]], although the [[British Army]] maintains a presence in the Sultanate at the request of the Government of Brunei.

In [[1997]], Britain's last major overseas territory, [[Hong Kong]], became a [[Special administrative region (People's Republic of China)|Special Administrative Region]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] under the terms of the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] agreed some thirteen years previously.

==Legacy==

Britain retains sovereignty over fourteen<ref>http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1013618138295</ref> territories outside of the British Isles, collectively named the [[British overseas territories]], which remain under British rule due to lack of support for independence among the local population, because of a small population size dependent on British economic subsidies making the possibility of success as a sovereign nation more difficult, or because the territory is uninhabited except for transient military or scientific personnel.

Most former British colonies (and one former Portuguese colony) are members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a non-political, voluntary association of equal members, in which Britain has no privileged status.  Although the head of the Commonwealth is currently the British head of state, Queen Elizabeth II, her heir to the British throne will not automatically succeed her as head of the Commonwealth.  Fifteen members of the Commonwealth continue to share their head of state with Britain, the [[Commonwealth Realms]].<ref>http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/150757/head_of_the_commonwealth/</ref>

Many former British colonies share certain characteristics:

*The [[English language]] as either the main or secondary language.

*A democratic parliamentary system of government modelled on the [[Westminster system]].

*A [[legal system]] based upon [[English law]].  The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], one of the United Kingdom's highest courts of appeal, still serves as the highest court of appeal for several former colonies.

*Educational Insitutions such as [[boarding school]]s and universities modelled on the [[Ancient university|Ancient Universities]]

*The most popular sports are [[football (soccer)|football]], [[cricket]] or [[Rugby football|rugby]].

*A [[military]], [[police]] and [[Civil service|civil service]] based upon British models.

*Scottish and English banking methods
