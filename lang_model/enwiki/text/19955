Selig was previously the team owner and team president of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. As a Milwaukee native, he is credited for keeping baseball in Milwaukee. In 1970, he purchased the [[Seattle Pilots]] in bankruptcy court and renamed them the Milwaukee Brewers after a minor league team he had watched in his youth. The Brewers went to the [[1982 World Series]] and won seven organization of the year awards during his tenure. Selig remains a resident of Milwaukee.

On January 17, 2008, Selig's contract was extended by the MLB through 2012, at which point he plans to retire.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080117&content_id=2347936&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb The Official Site of Major League Baseball: News: Major League Baseball News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Selig made $14.5 million in the 12-month period ending Oct. 31, 2005.<ref name="Extension"/>

==Early life==
Selig grew up in a [[Jewish]] family and eventually graduated from the [[University of Wisconsin Madison]] in 1956 with degrees in [[political science]] and history.<ref name="Bio">[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/about_mlb/executives.jsp?bio=selig_bud MLB Bio]</ref> He served 2 years in the armed forces before working with his father who owned a car leasing business in Milwaukee.<ref name="Bio"/> Selig continues to be involved in the automotive industry, serving as president of the Selig Executive Lease Company.<ref name="Bio"/>

As a young man, Selig watched the Milwaukee Brewers, a minor-league affiliate of the [[Chicago Cubs]] of the [[National League]], unrelated to the current incarnation of the Milwaukee Brewers. Bud soon became a [[Milwaukee Braves|Braves]] fan when the National League franchise moved to his home town of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]] from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] in [[1953 in baseball|1953]]. Selig became the team's largest public stockholder. Selig was heartbroken and devastated when he learned that the Braves were going to leave Milwaukee in favor of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. In [[1965 in baseball|1965]], when the Braves left Milwaukee, he divested his stock in the team.

==Milwaukee Brewers owner==
{{seealso|Atlanta Braves}}
As a minority owner of the [[Atlanta Braves|Milwaukee Braves]], Selig founded the organization '''''Teams, Inc''''', in an attempt to prevent the majority owners (based out of Chicago) from moving the club to a larger television market. This was challenged legally on the basis that no prior team relocations (in the modern era) left a city without a team. Prior movements had all originated in cities which were home to at least two teams. When his quest to keep the team in Milwaukee finally failed after the [[1965 in baseball|1965]] season, he changed the group's name to '''''Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club, Inc.''''', after the [[Milwaukee Brewers (minor league baseball team)|minor league baseball team]] he grew up watching, and devoted himself to returning Major League Baseball to Milwaukee.

Selig arranged for major league games to be played at the now demolished [[Milwaukee County Stadium]]. The first, a pre-season match between the [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[Minnesota Twins]], drew more than 51,000 spectators. Selig followed this up by hosting nine White Sox regular-season games in [[1968 in baseball|1968]] and eleven in [[1969 in baseball|1969]]. Oddly enough, one of the series played in Milwaukee that year was against the expansion [[Seattle Pilots]], the team that would become the Brewers. Those Milwaukee "home" games were phenomenally successful, with the handful of games accounting for about ''one-third'' of total White Sox home attendance. Clearly, Milwaukee was hungry for baseball.

To satisfy that fanbase, Selig decided to purchase the White Sox (with the intention of moving them to Milwaukee) in 1969. He entered into an agreement to buy the club, but the [[American League]] vetoed the sale, preferring to keep an American League team in Chicago to compete with the crosstown [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]]. Selig turned his attention to other franchises.

In [[1970 in baseball|1970]], he purchased the bankrupt Seattle Pilots franchise, moving them to his hometown and officially renaming the team the '''Brewers'''.

During Selig's tenure as club president, the Brewers participated in postseason play in 1981, when the team finished first in the American League East during the second half of the season, and in 1982, when the team made it to the [[1982 World Series|World Series]], under the leadership of future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] [[Robin Yount]] and [[Paul Molitor]]. Under Selig's watch, the Brewers also won seven '''''Organization of the Year''''' awards. Selig was part of owner's [[Baseball collusion#1985-1987|collusion]] in [[1985 in baseball|1985]]&ndash;[[1987 in baseball|1987]], resulting in the owners paying [[United States dollar|$]]280 million in damages to the players.

Upon his assumption of the commissioner's role, Selig transferred his ownership interest in the Brewers to his daughter [[Wendy Selig-Prieb]] in order to remove any technical conflicts of interest, though it was widely presumed he maintained some hand in team operations. Although the team has been sold to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] investor [[Mark Attanasio]], questions remain regarding Selig's past involvement. Selig's defenders point to the poor management of the team after Selig-Prieb took control as proof that Selig was not working behind the scenes.

==Acting Commissioner (1992&ndash;1998)==
Selig became an increasingly vocal opponent of Commissioner [[Fay Vincent]], and soon became the leader of a group of owners seeking his removal. Selig has never stated that the owners [[Baseball collusion|colluded]], while Vincent has:
{{quote|The [[Major League Baseball Players Association|Union]] basically doesn<U+2019>t trust the ownership because [[Baseball collusion|collusion]] was a [[United States dollar|$]]280 million theft by Selig and [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] of that money from the players. I mean, they rigged the signing of free agents. They got caught. They paid $280 million to the players. And I think that<U+2019>s polluted labor relations in baseball ever since it happened. I think it<U+2019>s the reason [[MLBPA]] executive director [[Donald Fehr]] has no trust in Selig.<ref>[http://www.bizofbaseball.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1173&Itemid=81 Interview with Fay Vincent]</ref>|Fay Vincent}}
Following an 18-9 no-confidence vote, Vincent resigned. Selig had by this time become chairman of the '''Executive Council of Major League Baseball''', and as such became ''de facto'' acting commissioner.

His first major act was to institute the Wild Card and divisional playoff play, which has created much controversy amongst baseball fans. Those against the Wild Card see it as diminishing the importance of the pennant race and the regular season, with the true race often being for second rather than first place, while those in favor of it view it as an opportunity for teams to have a shot at the playoffs even when they have no chance of a first-place finish in their division, thus maintaining fan interest later in the season.

Selig suspended [[Cincinnati Reds]] owner [[Marge Schott]] for a year in [[1993 in baseball|1993]] for repeated prejudicial remarks and actions. The same year, [[New York Yankees]] owner [[George Steinbrenner]] was reinstated from a lifelong suspension that was instituted by Selig's predecessor [[Fay Vincent]]. [[Pete Rose]] has claimed that he applied for reinstatement over the years and received no such consideration. It should be noted that Rose, along with his close friend and former teammate [[Mike Schmidt]] (who is a strong supporter of Rose's reinstatement into baseball), met with Selig in [[2002 in baseball|2002]], where Rose privately admitted to Selig (two years before going public with his admission) about [[Dowd Report|betting on baseball]]. Incidentally, Bud Selig was a close friend of the late [[A. Bartlett Giamatti|Bart Giamatti]], who was the commissioner when Rose was first banned from the sport in [[1989 in baseball|1989]].

As acting commissioner, Selig represented MLB during the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|1994 players strike]] and cancelled the [[1994 World Series|World Series]], marking the first time the annual event had not been staged since [[1904 World Series|1904]]).

==Commissioner (1998&ndash;present)==
After a six-year search for a new commissioner, the owners voted to give Selig the title on a permanent basis midway through the [[1998 in baseball|1998]] season.

During his tenure the game avoided a third work stoppage in [[2002 in baseball|2002]], and has seen the implementation of [[interleague play]].

Whereas in the past, the National and American Leagues had separate administrative organizations (which, for example, allowed for the introduction of different rules such as the [[designated hitter]]), under Selig, Major League Baseball consolidated the administrative functions of the [[American League|American]] and [[National League]] into the Commissioner's Office in [[2000 in baseball|2000]]. The last official presidents of the NL and AL were [[Leonard S. Coleman, Jr.]] and Dr. [[Gene Budig]] respectively.

===Reaction after September 11, 2001===

On September 11, 2001, Selig ordered all baseball games postponed for a week because of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terror attacks on New York and Washington]]. The games were postponed not only out of respect and mourning for the victims, but also out of concern for the safety and security of fans and players.

After a dramatic conclusion of the [[2001 World Series]], less than 48 hours later, Selig held a vote on contracting two teams, reportedly the [[Minnesota Twins]] and [[Montreal Expos]].<ref name="ESPN-ContractionTimeline">{{cite web

This action led to Selig (along with former Expos owner [[Jeffrey Loria]]) being charged with racketeering and conspiring with Loria to deliberately defraud the Expos minority owners. If found guilty the league could have been liable for [[United States dollar|$]]300 million in punitive damages. Selig was eager to settle the case because the judge had previously ruled that the Expos could not be moved or contracted until the case was over. The case eventually went to arbitration and was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.

===Changes to the MLB All-Star Game===
An embarrassing moment for Selig occurred during the [[2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2002 All-Star Game]] in Selig's hometown of [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Milwaukee]]. The game was tied 7-7 in the bottom of the 11th inning. Unfortunately, the recent managerial custom of granting some playing time within the regulation nine innings to as many available players as possible meant that the managers had used their entire rosters. To avoid risking the arms of the pitchers who were currently on the mound, Selig declared the game a tie, to the dissatisfaction of the Milwaukee fans. Since then, Selig has tried to reinvigorate the All-Star Game, most notably by awarding the winning league home-field advantage in the World Series. The [[2003 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2003 All-Star Game]] had the same U.S. viewership as 2002 (9.5 [[Nielsen Ratings#Ratings.2FShare and total viewers|rating]]; 17 [[Nielsen Ratings#Ratings.2FShare and total viewers|share]]) and the ratings declined in 2004 (8.8 rating; 15 share) and 2005 (8.1 rating; 14 share).<ref>[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/asgbox/asgtv.shtml All-Star Game Television Ratings on Baseball Almanac<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The American television audience increased in 2006 (9.3 rating; 16 share).<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/baseball/mlb/specials/all_star/2006/07/12/bc.bbo.all.starratings.ap/index.html SI.com - MLB - 2006 All Star Game - Ratings up for All-Star Game, HR Derby - Wednesday July 12, 2006 6:41PM<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Disciplinary actions===
On July 1, 2005, Selig suspended [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] pitcher [[Kenny Rogers (baseball player)|Kenny Rogers]] for 20 games and fined him [[United States dollar|$]]50,000. Rogers got in trouble when on June 29, 2005, he purposely grabbed the camera of a cameraman, resulting in one camera falling to the ground. When the cameraman proceeded to pick up his camera, Rogers went back to him in an arguably threatening way. One of the reporters then resumed filming and Rogers smiled and talked to him. While an appeal of his suspension was pending, Rogers appeared at the [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2005 All-Star Game]] in [[Detroit Michigan|Detroit]], where fans loudly booed him. On July 22, 2005, Selig heard Rogers' appeal of his suspension; he decided to uphold the 20 games. However, an independent arbitrator ruled that Selig had exceeded his authority and reduced it to 13 games.

===Performance-enhancing drugs===
In [[2005 in baseball|2005]], Selig faced [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] on the issue of [[Anabolic steroids|steroids]]. After the Congressional hearings in early 2005, and with the scrutiny of the sports and national media upon this issue, Selig put forth a proposal for a stricter performance-enhancing drug testing regime to replace the current system. This proposal also included the banning of [[amphetamines]], a first for the major North American sports leagues. The [[Major League Baseball Players Association|MLB Players Association]] and MLB reached an agreement in November on the new policy.<ref>{{cite news

{{mainarticle|2006 Baseball steroids investigation}}
In early 2006, Selig was forced to deal with the issue of [[Anabolic steroid|steroid]] use. 

On March 30, 2006, as a response to the controversy of the use of performance-enhancing drugs and the anticipated career home run record to be set by Barry Bonds, Selig asked former senator [[George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell]] to lead an independent investigation into the use of steroids in baseball's recent past. [[Joe Sheehan]] from [[Baseball Prospectus]] wrote that the commission has been focusing "blame for the era exclusively on uniformed personnel", and failing to investigate any role played by team ownership and management.<ref>{{cite web

Much controversy surrounded Selig and his involvement in [[Barry Bonds]]' all-time home run record chase. For months, speculation surrounded Selig and the possibility that he and [[Hank Aaron]] would not attend Bonds' games as he closed in on the record. Selig announced in July 2007 when Bonds was near 755 home runs that he would attend the games. Selig was in attendance for Bonds' record-tying home run against the [[San Diego Padres]], sitting in Padres owner [[John Moores (baseball)|John Moores]]' private suite. Bud Selig did not attend the San Francisco Giants' baseball game on August 7 when Barry Bonds hit his record-breaking 756th home run; after the event, Selig released a statement congratulating Bonds.

On November 15, 2007, attention was brought once again to Barry Bonds as he was [[indict]]ed by a federal [[Grand Jury]] for [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]] in connection to his testimony before the Grand Jury regarding [[BALCO]], a [[San Francisco]] [[Bay area]] lab known to be involved in the distribution of [[steroids]] to professional athletes.

On December 13, 2007, former [[U.S. Senator]] [[George Mitchell]] released [[Mitchell Report (baseball)|his report on the use of performance-enhancing substances by MLB players]]. The report names many current and former players who allegedly used performance-enhancing drugs during their career, including [[Roger Clemens]], [[Andy Pettitte]], [[Miguel Tejada]], [[Eric Gagn<U+00E9>]], and [[Paul Lo Duca]].

Selig has been widely criticized for not taking an active enough role to stem the tide of steroid use in baseball until it had blossomed into a debilitating problem for the industry. [[Chicago Sun Times]] columnist [[Jay Mariotti]] called Selig the "The Steroids Commissioner."<ref>[http://www.suntimes.com/sports/mariotti/742620,mariotti011608.article Selig's only legacy: S-T-E-R-O-I-D-S]</ref> Selig has been called to [[United States Congress|Congress]] several times to testify on performance enhancing drug use. Congressman [[Cliff Stearns]] said in December 2007 that Selig should resign because of use of performance enhancing drugs in baseball during his tenure.<ref name="Extension"/>

===Term of service===
On December 1, 2006, Selig announced that he would be retiring as commissioner of baseball upon the expiration of his contract in 2009. Selig earned $14.5 million from MLB over the timespan October 31, 2005 to October 31, 2006<ref>{{cite web

Bud Selig helped introduce the following changes to Major League Baseball:
* Realignment of teams into three divisions per league, and the introduction of playoff [[Wild card (sports)#Major League Baseball|wild card]] teams (1994)
*[[Interleague play]] (1997)
*Two additional franchises: the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] and the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] (1998)
*Abolition of the [[National League|National]] and [[American League]] offices and presidencies, and inclusion of all [[Umpire (baseball)|umpiring crews]] into a common pool for AL and NL games, instead of having separate pools per league
*Home field advantage in the [[World Series]] granted to the winner of the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All Star Game]] in the same season (2003)

==Israel Baseball League==
Selig and his family served a supportive role on the Advisory Board of the [[Israel Baseball League]] during its inaugural season in 2007. In response to issues with the league's financial management, after the season, the Selig family requested that their names be removed from the list of board members.<ref name="JerusalemPost-IBL">{{Citation
