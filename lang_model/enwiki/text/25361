'''Lego''' is a line of [[toy]]s featuring colorful plastic bricks, gears, [[minifigure]]s (also called minifigs or mini-figs), and other pieces which can be assembled to create models of almost anything imaginable. Cars, planes, trains, buildings, castles, sculptures, ships, spaceships, and even working [[Lego Mindstorms|robots]] are just a few of the many things that can be made with Lego bricks. High production quality and careful attention to detail ensures that Lego pieces can fit together in myriad ways, which is one of the main reasons for the toy's success.

The sets are produced by the [[LEGO Group|Lego Group]], a privately-held company based in [[Denmark]].

==Brief history==
:''Main article: [[History of Lego]]. Also see: [[Lego timeline]]''

The Lego Group had humble beginnings in the workshop of [[Ole Kirk Christiansen]], a poor carpenter from [[Billund]], Denmark. Ole Kirk started creating wooden toys in 1932, but it was not until 1949 that the plastic Lego brick was created. The company name Lego was coined by Christiansen from the Danish phrase ''leg godt'', meaning "play well".

In 1947, Ole Kirk and his son [[Godtfred Kirk Christiansen]] obtained samples of interlocking plastic bricks produced by the company [[Kiddicraft]]. These "Kiddicraft Self-Locking Building Bricks" were designed and patented in the UK by [[Hilary Harry Fisher Page]], a child psychologist. A few years later, in 1949, Lego began producing similar bricks, calling them "Automatic Binding Bricks." These bricks, manufactured from [[cellulose acetate]], were developed in the spirit of traditional wooden blocks that could be stacked upon one another; however, these plastic bricks could be "locked" together. They had several round "studs" on top, and a hollow rectangular bottom. The blocks snapped together, but not so tightly that they could not be pulled apart.
[[Image:Toys R Us Chrysler Building.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A [[Chrysler Building]] replica made entirely of Lego bricks, on display at the [[Times Square]] location of [[Toys "R" Us]] in [[New York City]].]]
The use of plastic for toy manufacture was not highly regarded by retailers and consumers of the time. Many of the Lego Group's shipments were returned, following poor sales; it was thought that plastic toys could never replace wooden ones.

By 1954, Christiansen's son, Godtfred, had become the junior managing director of the Lego Group. It was his conversation with an overseas buyer that struck the idea of a toy system. Godtfred saw the immense potential in Lego bricks to become a system for creative play, but the bricks still had some problems from a technical standpoint: their "locking" ability was limited, and they were not very versatile. It was not until 1958 that the modern-day brick design was developed, and it took another five years to find exactly the right material for it.

Over the years many more Lego sets, series, and pieces were created, with many innovative improvements and additions, culminating in the colourful versatile building toys that we know today.

== The Lego trademark ==
The [[LEGO Group|Lego Group]]'s name has become so synonymous with its flagship toy that many use the words "Lego" (collectively) or "Legos" to refer to the bricks themselves, and even to any plastic bricks resembling Lego bricks, although the Lego Group discourages this as [[trademark dilution|dilution]] of their [[trademark]]. Lego catalogues in the 1970s and 1980s contained a note that read:

<blockquote>"The word LEGO<U+00AE> is a brand name and is very special to all of us in the LEGO Group Companies. We would sincerely like your help in keeping it special. Please always refer to our bricks as 'LEGO Bricks or Toys' and not 'LEGOS.' By doing so, you will be helping to protect and preserve a brand of which we are very proud and that stands for quality the world over. Thank you! Susan Williams, Consumer Services."</blockquote>

[[Image:Lego sorry.gif|thumb|180px|left|A message displayed to visitors of http://legos.com/]]

A similar message also appeared to everyone who errantly visited http://legos.com in the year 2005, however it was removed within the next several months, but not before generating a media buzz of notable proportions.

"Lego" is officially written in all [[Majuscule|uppercase]] letters. The company asserts that to protect its brand name, the word Lego must always be used as an adjective, as in "LEGO set," "LEGO products," "LEGO universe," and so forth. Nevertheless, such corporate admonitions are frequently ignored, also here on Wikipedia, and the word ''lego'' is commonly used not only as a noun to refer to Lego bricks, but also as a generic term referring to any kind of interlocking toy brick.

==Design and manufacture==
[[Image:lego.jpg|thumb|250px|right|There are many types of Lego bricks and pieces.]]
[[Image:LEGO minifigs.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Lego sets feature a large variety of themed people (called <U+201C>minifigures<U+201D>), including the Space, Castle, and City figures above.]]
Since their introduction in 1949, Lego pieces of all varieties have been, first and foremost, part of a ''system''. Lego pieces from 1963 still interlock with pieces made in 2006, despite radical changes in shape and design over the years. Retail Lego sets for young children are compatible with those made for teenagers.

Bricks, beams, axles, minifigures, and all other elements in the Lego system are manufactured to an exacting degree of [[Tolerance (engineering)|tolerance]]. When snapped together, pieces must have just the right amount of "clutch power"; they must stay together until pulled apart. They cannot be too easy to pull apart, or the result will be Lego creations that are unstable; they cannot be too difficult to pull apart, since the disassembly of one creation in order to build another is part of the Lego appeal. In order for pieces to have just the right "clutch power", Lego elements are manufactured within a [[Tolerance in Engineering|tolerance]] of 2 [[micrometre]]s (0.00008 in).

Since 1963, Lego pieces are manufactured from a strong, resilient plastic known as [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]], or ABS. Precision-machined, small-capacity moulds are used, and human inspectors meticulously check the output of the moulds, to eliminate significant variations in colour or thickness. Worn-out moulds are encased in the foundations of buildings to prevent their falling into competitors' hands. According to the Lego Group, its moulding processes are so accurate that only 18 bricks out of every million fail to meet its stringent standards. It is thanks to this care in manufacturing that the Lego Group has maintained such a high degree of quality over the decades; this is one of the main reasons that pieces manufactured over 40 years ago still interlock neatly with pieces manufactured today.

Manufacturing of Lego bricks occurs at a number of locations around the world. Moulding is done at one of two plants in [[Denmark]] and [[Switzerland]]. Brick decorations and packaging is done at plants in Denmark, Switzerland, [[United States]], [[South Korea]] and the [[Czech Republic]]. Annual production of Lego bricks averages approximately 20 billion (2 <U+00D7> 10<sup>10</sup>) per year, or about 600 pieces per second.

==Lego today==
[[Image:Trafalgar legoland Copyright2003KTai.jpg|thumbnail|250px|A model of Trafalgar Square in London can be found in Legoland Windsor.]]

[[Image:Lego Chicago City View 2001.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A Lego City.]]
Since it began producing plastic bricks, the Lego Group has released thousands of play sets themed around space, robots, [[Lego Pirates|pirates]], [[Lego Vikings|vikings]], medieval castles, dinosaurs, cities, suburbia, holiday locations, wild west, the [[Arctic]], boats, racing cars, trains, ''[[Lego Star Wars (lego theme)|Star Wars]]'', ''[[Lego Harry Potter|Harry Potter]]'', ''[[Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Lego Batman|Batman]]'', ''[[LEGO SpongeBob SquarePants|SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' and more.  As always, new Lego pieces are released frequently along with new sets. 

There are also motors, gears, lights, sensors, and cameras available to be used with Lego components. There are even special bricks, like the [[Lego Mindstorms#The RCX programmable brick|LEGO RCX]] that can be programmed with a [[personal computer|PC]] to perform very complicated and useful tasks. These programmable bricks are sold under the name [[Lego Mindstorms]]. 

There are several [[:Category:Robotics competitions|competitions]] which use Lego bricks and the RCX, among other microcontrollers, for robotics. The earliest, and likely the largest, is [[Botball]], a national US middle- and high-school competition stemming from the MIT 6270 lego robotics tournament. A related competition is [[FIRST]] [[FIRST|Lego League]] for elementary and middle schools. The international [[RoboCup Junior]] [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] [[soccer]] competition involves extensive use of [[Lego Mindstorms]] equipment which is often pushed to its limits. 

Lego Group operates several [[Legoland]] [[amusement parks]] in [[Europe]] and [[California]]. On July 13, 2005 the control of 70% of the Lego Amusement Parks was sold for $460 million dollars to the Blackstone Group of New York while the remaining 30% is still held by the Lego Group. There are also several Lego Brand retail stores, including at [[Downtown Disney]] in both the [[Disneyland Resort|Disneyland]] and [[Walt Disney World Resort]]s and in the [[Mall of America]] in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]]. As of year end 2005, there are 25 LEGO Brand Retail stores in the USA, a number of stores in Europe, and a franchised LEGO store in [[Abu Dhabi]].

==Fan culture and community==
Lego bricks today are used for purposes beyond children's play. The Lego Group itself has developed a form of business consultancy fostering creative thinking, called [[Lego Serious Play]], in which team members build metaphors of their organisational experiences using Lego bricks, and work through imaginary scenarios using the visual device of the Lego constructions and by exploring possibilities in a 'serious' form of 'play'.

A cult following of people who have used Lego pieces to make sculptures, very large mosaics and complex machines has developed. Some sculptures use hundreds of thousands of pieces and weigh tens of kilograms. Large mosaics, fully functional padlocks and pendulum clocks, a [http://www.henrylim.org/Harpsichord.html harpsichord] and an inkjet printer (built by [[Google]] co-founder [[Larry Page]] while at the [[University of Michigan]]) have been constructed from Lego pieces. One such masterpiece solves a [[Rubik's Cube]] through the use of Lego motors and cameras, a task that many humans cannot accomplish. Photos of many fan creations like these can be seen at [http://www.brickshelf.com/ Brickshelf] and at [http://www.mocpages.com/ MOCpages]. A group which calls itself "[[AFOL]]s" (for "Adult Fans of Lego") is an important demographic for The Lego Group, which has recently begun reintroducing popular sets from previous years to appeal to this group.

Lego toys have been used in a number of unexpected ways. For example, at [[The Brick Testament]] "The Reverend" [[Brendan Powell Smith]] has built the [[Bible]] in Lego pieces. The site features over 2,000 photographs of Biblical scenes. [[Legowars]], the generic term for a number of wargames (most notably [[Brikwars]]) involving Lego bricks enjoys a cult-like popularity. The website [http://www.theory.org.uk/lego.htm theory.org.uk] (by academic [[David Gauntlett]]) features Lego versions of [[social sciences|social theorists]]. A set of [[software]] tools called [[LDraw]] or [http://www.lego.com/ldd LEGO Digital Designer] can be used to model possible Lego creations in 3D. Because of the high degree of uniformity in Lego bricks, they have also been used in fields such as [[computer vision]], in which knowing the exact dimensions and relative positions of objects is useful for creating test data. Another novel application of Lego bricks is the combination of bricks and electronic components to obtain a [http://computer.team.lu/legoelectronic/index.html Lego Electronic Lab Kit].

A growing application for [[AFOL]]s is 'cooperative building", the goal being to produce vast displays for Lego shows and fan meets. [http://www.zemi.net/moonbase/ Moonbase] is a Space LEGO building system comprised of individual "modules" built by hundreds of different LEGO builders. These  individual modules join together to create large layouts at LEGO conventions and gatherings. Another example of cooperative building is [http://www.teamhassenplug.org/GBC/ "The Great Ball Contraption"] in which enthusiasts are requested to build a machine of carefully specified dimensions that is handed a Lego soccer ball once every second or so. Its job is to do something ''interesting'' with the ball and then passes it on to another ''contraption''. By connecting a long chain of such machines together, a vast [[Rube Goldberg]] system can be assembled that 'processes' soccer balls from one end of the system to the other having passed each ball through the entire chain of contraptions. Other examples are [http://www.classic-castle.com/ccc/cccstandard.html medieval castles] and [http://iltco.org/ train layouts].

==Lego in art==
[[Image:Magic Kingdom Nessy.jpg|right|thumbnail|150px|The [[Walt Disney World Resort]] features a sculpture of the [[Loch Ness Monster]] made of Lego bricks.]]
One hobby among enthusiasts is to make short movies (or re-create popular scenes from famous movies), using Lego bricks for the scenery and Lego play sets as characters. Such movies are called "Lego movies", "[[Brickfilm]]s", or "cinema Lego". They usually use [[stop motion]] animation. For example, the ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' [[special edition]] [[DVD]] contained a version of the "Camelot" musical sequence redone with Lego minifigures and accessories.

Lego used to sell a line of sets named "LEGO Studios" (now discontinued), which contains a Lego [[web cam]] (repackaged Logitech USB Quickcam Web), software to record video on a computer, black plastic rods which can be used to manipulate minifigures from off-camera and a minifigure resembling [[Steven Spielberg]]. Because of the low quality of the camera and software most Brickfilmers don't use it.

Another notable example is the award-winning [[music video]] for the song "[[Fell in Love with a Girl]]" by the [[White Stripes]]. Director [[Michel Gondry]] filmed a live version of the video, [[digitizing|digitized]] the result and then recreated it entirely with Lego bricks.

Artists have also used Lego sets with one of the more notorious examples being Polish artist [[Zbigniew Libera]]'s "[http://users.erols.com/kennrice/lego-kz.htm Lego Concentration Camp]", a collection of mocked-up [[concentration camp]]-themed Lego sets.

The Little Artists have created an entire Modern Art collection in a Lego Gallery. '[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/littleartists/ Art Craziest Nation]' was shown at the [[Walker Art Gallery]] in [[Liverpool]], UK.

Several [[webcomic]]s are illustrated with Lego, notably [[Irregular Webcomic!]].

A redubbed version of the song "[[Dragostea Din Tei]]" by [[O-Zone]] uses the Lego system to recreate the music video. This version is entitled LegO-zone.  Some fans believe it is a [[Numa Numa]] [[parody]].

* In 1999, a highly qualified sought-after design engineer had successfully made as a condition of employment that a full-sized desk of Lego bricks be constructed for him at his new workplace.
* "Legot" (or "leegot"), plural form of "lego" (or "leego") is also used as a [[Finnish language|Finnish]] [[slang]] term for human teeth, because of the rectangular shape of the teeth.
* Six eight-stud Lego bricks of the same colour can be put together in 915,103,765 ways, and just three bricks of the same colour offer 1,560 combinations. The figure of 102,981,500 is often given for six pieces, but it is incorrect. The number 102,981,504 (four more than that figure) is the number of six-piece towers (of a height of six).<ref>The ''Entropy of LEGO'', ''A LEGO Counting Problem'', and [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|OEIS]] Sequence {{OEIS2C|id=A112389}}.</ref> 
*The Lego group is the largest [[tire]] (tyre [[British English|UK]]) <!--tire (U.S. spelling) or tyre (UK spelling) Do not Edit war over which one to use there is no correct version--> manufacturer in the world, producing over 300 million minature tires each year.
*The word "Lego" comes from [[Danish language|Danish]] ''leg godt'' which translates to "play well". The name could also be interpreted as "I put together" or "I assemble" in Latin, though this would be a somewhat forced application of the general sense "I collect; I gather; I learn"; the word is most used in the derived sense, "I read". The [[cognate]] Greek verb "<U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03B3><U+03C9>" also means "gather, pick up", but this can include constructing a stone wall.<ref>Homer, [[Odyssey]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0136&layout=&loc=18.359 18.359]</ref> 
<!--WARNING: Do not add info regarding the US$200 000 Lego thief; until more notable trivia like the tallest Lego tower, the biggest private collection of Lego elements, largest Lego sculpture/model etc... are added, this bit of info is unwarranted.
