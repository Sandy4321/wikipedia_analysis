'''Lake Toba''' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: '''''Danau Toba''''') is a [[lake]] and [[supervolcano]], 100 km long and 30 km wide, and 505 m. (1,666 ft.) at its deepest point, in the middle of the northern part of the [[Indonesia]]n [[island]] of [[Sumatra]] with a surface elevation of about 900 m (3,000 feet), stretching from {{coor d|2.88|N|98.52|E|}} to {{coor d|2.35|N|99.1|E|}}. It is the largest [[volcanic lake]] in the world.<ref name="WorldLakes"/> In addition, it is the site of the 75,000-year-old supervolcanic eruption, the largest in the last 25 million years; where it staged a massive climate-changing event that scientists believe might have wiped out much of civilization. The massive eruption is believed to have a VEI intensity of 8.

==Geology==
The Toba caldera complex in Northern Sumatra, Indonesia consists of four overlapping volcanic craters that adjoin the Sumatran "volcanic front". The youngest and fourth caldera is the world<U+2019>s largest Quarternary caldera (100 by 30 kilometers) and intercepts the three older calderas. An estimate of 2500-3000 cubic kilometers of [[dense-rock equivalent]] pyroclastic material, nicknamed the Youngest Toba tuff, was blasted from the youngest caldera during one of the largest single eruptions in geologic history. Following the "Youngest Toba tuff eruption", a typical resurgent dome formed within the new caldera, joining two half-domes separated by a longitudinal graben.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geo.mtu.edu/~raman/papers/ChesnerGeology.pdf|last=Chesner, C.A., Westgate, J.A., Rose, W.I., Drake, R., Deino, A.|title=Eruptive history of Earth's largest Quarternary caldera (Toba, Indonesia)|publisher=Michigan Technological University|date=March 1991|accesdate=2008-8-23}}</ref>

===The eruption===

[[Image:Lake Toba location.png|thumb|left|Location of Lake Toba shown in red on map.]]
The '''Toba eruption''' (the '''Toba event''') occurred at what is now Lake Toba about 67,500 to 75,500 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Zielinski | first = G. A. | coauthors = P.A.

The Toba eruption was the latest of a series of at least three [[caldera]]-forming eruptions which have occurred at the volcano. Earlier calderas were formed around 700,000 and 840,000 years ago.<ref name=VolcanoUndNodak/>

To give an idea of its magnitude, consider that although the eruption took place in [[Indonesia]], it deposited an ash layer approximately 15 cm (6 in) thick over the entire Indian subcontinent; at one site in central India, the Toba ash layer today is up to 6 m (20 feet) thick<ref>Acharyya S.K., and Basu P.K. 1992. "Toba ash on the Indian subcontinent and its implications for correlation of late pleistocene alluvium." ''Quaternary Research'' '''40''':10-19</ref> and parts of [[Malaysia]] were covered with 9 m of ashfall.<ref>Scrivenor, J.B. 1931. ''The Geology of Malaya'' (London: MacMillan), noted by Weber.</ref> In addition it has been calculated that 10<sup>10</sup> metric tons of [[sulphuric acid]] was ejected into the atmosphere by the event, causing [[acid rain]] fallout.<ref>Huang C.Y., Zhao M.X., Wang C.C., and Wei G.J. 2001. "Cooling of the South China Sea by the Toba eruption and correlation with other climate proxies ca. 71,000 years ago." ''Geophysical Research Letters'' '''28''':3915-3918, noted by Weber.</ref>

The subsequent collapse formed a caldera that, after filling with water, created Lake Toba. The island in the center of the lake is formed by a [[resurgent dome]].

Though the year can never be precisely determined, the season can: only the [[Monsoon|summer monsoon]] could have deposited Toba ashfall in the South China Sea, implying that the eruption took place sometime during the northern summer.<ref>B<U+00FC>hring C., and Sarnthein M. 2000. "Toba ash layers in the South China Sea: evidence of contrasting wind directions during eruption ca. 74 ka." ''Geology'' '''28''':275-278.</ref> The eruption lasted perhaps two weeks, but the ensuing "volcanic winter" resulted in a  decrease in average global temperatures by 3 to 3.5 degrees Celsius for several years. [[Ice core|Greenland ice core]]s record a pulse of starkly reduced levels of organic carbon sequestration. Very few plants or animals in southeast Asia would have survived, and it is possible that the eruption caused a planet-wide die-off. There is some evidence, based on [[mitochondrial DNA]], that the human race may have passed through a [[genetic bottleneck]] within this timeframe, reducing genetic diversity below what would be expected from the age of the species. According to the [[Toba catastrophe theory]] proposed by Stanley H. Ambrose of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] in 1998, human populations may have been reduced to only a few tens of thousands of individuals by the Toba eruption.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.semp.us/publications/biot_reader.php?BiotID=164 |title=Yellowstone Is a Supervolcano? |accessdate=2008-02-21 |format=HTML |work=SEMP }}</ref>

=== More recent activity===
[[Image:Lake-toba-2.jpg|thumbnail|upright|right|Children playing in Lake Toba]]
Smaller eruptions have occurred at Toba since.  The small cone of '''Pusukbukit''' has formed on the southwestern margin of the caldera and lava domes. The most recent eruption may have been at '''Tandukbenua''' on the northwestern caldera edge, since the present lack of vegetation could be due to an eruption within the last few hundred years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.volcanodiscovery.com/volcano-tours/volcanoes/indonesia/sumatra/toba/|title=Toba volcano (Indonesia, Sumatra)|publisher=VolcanoDiscovery.com}}<!-- Bot generated title --></ref>

Some parts of the caldera have experienced uplift due to partial refilling of the [[magma chamber]], for example pushing '''[[Samosir|Samosir Island]]''' and the '''Uluan Peninsula''' above the surface of the lake.  The lake sediments on Samosir Island show that it has been uplifted by at least 450 metres<ref name=VolcanoUndNodak/> since the cataclysmic eruption. Such uplifts are common in very large calderas, apparently due to the upward pressure of unerupted [[magma]]. Toba is probably the largest resurgent caldera on Earth. Large [[earthquake]]s have occurred in the vicinity of the volcano more recently, notably in 1987 along the southern shore of the lake at a depth of 11 km.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/eqarchives/significant/sig_1987.php|title=Significant Earthquakes of the World|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS)}}<!-- Bot generated title --></ref> Other earthquakes have occurred in the area in 1892, 1916, and 1920-1922.<ref name=VolcanoUndNodak>{{Cite web|url=http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/southeast_asia/indonesia/toba.html|title=Toba, Sumatra, Indonesia|publisher=[[Oregon State University]]}}<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Lake Toba lies near a fault line which runs along the centre of Sumatra called the Sumatra Fracture Zone.<ref name=VolcanoUndNodak/> The volcanoes of Sumatra and Java are part of the [[Sunda Arc]], a result of the northeasterly movement of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] which is sliding under the eastward-moving [[Eurasian Plate]]. The [[subduction zone]] in this area is very active: the seabed near the west coast of Sumatra has had several major earthquakes since 1995, including the 9.3 [[2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake]] and the 8.7 [[2005 Sumatra earthquake]], the epicenters of which were around 300 km from Toba.

On September 12, 2007, a magnitude 8.4 Earthquake shook the ground by Sumatra and was felt in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. The epicenter for this earthquake was not as close as the previous two earthquakes, but it was in the same vicinity.

==People==
Most of the people who live around Lake Toba are ethnically [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]]s. Traditional Batak houses are noted for their distinctive roofs (which curve upwards at each end, as a boat's hull does) and their colorful decor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indonesianmusic.com/batak.htm|title=Batak People|publisher=IndonesianMusic.com}}</ref>

==Flora and fauna==
Lake Toba offers a nurturing environment for fish such as the tilapia mossambica, aplocheilus pachax, lebistes reticulatus, [[osphronemus goramy]], [[trichogaster trichopterus]], [[channa striata]], chana gachua, [[clarias batrachus]], clarias nieuhofi, clarias. sp., nemachilus fasciatus, [[cyprinus carpio]], puntius javanicus, puntius binotatus, osteochilus nasselti, lissochilus sp., labeobarbus sora, and rasbora sp.<ref name=ILEC>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilec.or.jp/database/asi/asi-10.html|title=Danau Toba (Lake Toba)|publisher=International Lake Environment Committee}}</ref>

Many other types of plants and animals live within the boundaries of Lake Toba. [[Flora]] organisms include various types of [[phytoplankton]], emerged macrophytes, floating macrophytes, and submerged macrophytes. [[Fauna]] include several variations of [[zooplankton]] and [[benthos]].<ref name=ILEC/>
