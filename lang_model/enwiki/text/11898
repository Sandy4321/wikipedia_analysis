'''Great Captain Island Lighthouse''' is a [[lighthouse]] on [[Great Captain Island]] in the western [[Long Island Sound]] off the coast of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Connecticut]], United States. Built in 1829, the first lighthouse, made of stone, was of such poor construction that the walls were severely cracked a decade later. In 1868, a new granite dwelling with attached lantern was completed. The lighthouse is of the same design as lighthouses at [[Sheffield Island Light|Sheffield Island]] in Norwalk; [[Morgan Point Light|Morgan Point]] in Noank; [[Old Field Point Light]] and [[Plum Island Light|Plum Island]] in New York; and [[Block Island North Light|Block Island North]] in Rhode Island. In 1890 a fog whistle was added, in 1905 a siren was installed. The lighthouse was deactivated in 1970 when a [[skeletal tower]] replaced it. The Town of Greenwich acquired the property in 1973 and had full-time caretakers on the site until the lighthouse became to dilapidated in 2003. A successful restoration effort was completed in 2009 and a non-navigational light was activated in 2012. In 2010, a September 11 memorial plaque was installed to "honor the 23 people who lived in Greenwich, or had a connection to the town", who died in the September 11 attacks". In 1991, the Great Captain Island Light was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

==First lighthouse ==
In 1829, the federal government purchased 3.5 acres of land on the southeast part of [[Great Captain Island]] from Samuel Lyons, prior to the site being selected for a lighthouse. The other contending site, Stamford Point, became the subject of a 50-year long dispute between Connecticut and New York over its ownership, Connecticut eventually prevailed.<ref name=site /> Completed in 1829, the {{convert|30|ft|m}} stone lighthouse was built by Charles H. Smith for $3455.17 and it had a five-room keeper's house.<ref name=site /><ref name="book">{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FmDLA_mgdM0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Great+Captain+Island&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7BRIU6_mFuzjsAS9uYDQBQ&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Great%20Captain%20Island&f=false | title=A History of the Greenwich Waterfront: Tod's Point, Great Captain Island and the Greenwich Shoreline | publisher=The History Press | author=Jewell, Karen | year=2011}}</ref> By 1838, it was clear the construction was of poor quality and the walls were cracking. However, the structure remained in use until the new tower was completed in 1868. The original light was comprised of 10 lamps with reflectors, but it was upgraded to a fourth [[Fresnel lens]] in 1858. As a result of the new installation, the light changed to a fixed white light.<ref name=site />

In 1867, it was determined a new tower needed to be built and the new structure was completed in 1868.<ref name=site /> The new lighthouse was a keeper's quarters with an attached lantern on the roof. The structure is of the same design as lighthouses at [[Sheffield Island Light|Sheffield Island]] in Norwalk; [[Morgan Point Light|Morgan Point]] in Noank; [[Old Field Point Light]] and [[Plum Island Light|Plum Island]] in New York; and [[Block Island North Light|Block Island North]] in Rhode Island.<ref name=friends>[http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=782]"Great Captain Island, CT" page at LighthouseFriends.com Web site, accessed August 21, 2006</ref> The dwelling is made of granite and the lantern made of cast iron. The original Fresnel lens was installed in the new tower. In 1890, a fog whistle was installed and it would be replaced by a siren in 1905. The siren caused much distress to nearby residents and had to be modified.<ref name=site />

In 1970, a freestanding [[skeleton tower]] replaced the light and the vacant lighthouse was soon vandalized.<ref name=md0611/> In 1973, the town of [[Greenwich]] acquired the lighthouse and had full-time caretakers living in the light until 2003.<ref name=md0611/> A caretaker continued to live in the old lighthouse until 2003, when it became too dilapidated.<ref name=nv310/> In 1991, it was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name="hp">{{cite web | url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/91000351.pdf | title=National Register of Historic Places nomination - Great Captain Island Light | publisher=National Park Service | date=3 April 1991 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Clouette, Bruce and Roth, Matthew}}</ref>

==Renovation==
In the late 1990s, the Greenwich Chamber of Commerce started a campaign in the late 1990s to relight the lighthouse. It was assisted by the Indian Harbor Yacht Club. It suffered a setback as one of the fundraiser's original members, Bennett Fisher, died in the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]].<ref name=site />

A total of $1.13 million was used to restore the lighthouse, but different accounts of the money have been reflected in different sources. In May 2007, the government approved a $1 million appropriation for the restoration work.<ref name=md0611/> In the 1990s, a nonprofit group called Return the Light was formed and raised $305,000 for restoration work &mdash; most of it donated in the memory of Bennett Fisher.<ref name=md0611/> Carl White notes that "the non-profit was able to raise $305,000, and with Federal Funds, $1.13 million was obtained for the project".<ref name="white">{{cite web | url=http://www.greenwichlibrary.org/blog/historically_speaking/2012/04/lighting-the-darkness.html | title=Lighting the Darkness | publisher=Greenwich Library | date=28 April 2012 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=White, Carl}}</ref>

In 2008, a total of $1.2 million was budgeted for the restoration project. Restoration plans called for a new beacon and restoration of the caretaker's cottage quarters in the same building. A memorial walkway, garden and plaque will honor victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Interior work on the lighthouse was scheduled for April through July, with no exterior work during that time in order not to disturb breeding herons and egrets. The project was scheduled for completion in 2009.<ref name=nv310>Vigdor, Neil, "Bidding gets green light for repairs to islands's lighthouse", article, ''[[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]]'' of Stamford, Connecticut (probably reprinted from the ''[[Greenwich Time (newspaper)|Greenwich Time]]'' sister newspaper), March 10, 2008, p A3</ref> The restoration concerned some conservations because the work could disturb nesting herons and egrets. Tom Baptist, executive director of Audubon Connecticut and a Greenwich resident, said he supports the renovation work together with measures to protect the birds.<ref name=md0611/> In 2010, a September 11 memorial plaque was installed to "honor the 23 people who lived in Greenwich, or had a connection to the town", who died in the September 11 attacks".<ref name=white /> A non-navigational 4-second flashing green light was installed in the lighthouse on February 13, 2012. White writes that the light serves as a "tribute to the lighthouses and lighthouse keepers who were dedicated to saving lives on the Sound".<ref name=white />

A single dirt road leads to the lighthouse on the eastern side of the island, where most if the island's egrets tend to nest.<ref name=md0611>Dinan, Michael, "Lighthouse work may force birds to fly the coop", news article in ''[[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]]'' of [[Stamford, Connecticut]], page A3</ref> The Greenwich Department of Parks and Recreation oversees the island.<ref name=md0611/>
