|For eight to ten months, I didn't write anything, I turned a blind eye. My first album was so personal that I didn't know how to bounce back and talk about something else. The first disc, I had written six years, while there were only two years that passed. And what had I lived apart from a tour, a controversy and having banged three groupies? I do caricature, but there was nothing to tell an interesting story. I wrote ''Le chant des sir<U+00E8>nes'' by mixing reality and fiction, a little to rid myself of all that. In the end it helped me.

The album is called ''Le chant des sir<U+00E8>nes'' ([[French language|French]] for "the siren's song"), because it is "at an age and in an era where there are many temptations, many addicitions, a lot more than in the time of our grandparents. All my songs talk about it," explains Orelsan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evene.fr/musique/actualite/rencontre-orelsan-nouvel-album-le-chant-des-sirenes-3438.php |title=<U+00AB> Je n'ai jamais appel<U+00E9> <U+00E0> frapper une femme <U+00BB> |publisher=Evene |date=28 September 2011 |author=Adrien Toffolet |accessdate=24 March 2014}} {{fr}}</ref> In a similar fashion he explains the title of his album:

|It's easy, on Facebook and Twitter, when you're a bit known, when you're not doing well, you say it, and people you don't even know come in to bring your morale back up. It's also because of this that I called my album ''Le chant des sir<U+00E8>nes'', compared to this thing of temptation that creates social networks.

==Composition==
The album deals with what happened in Orelsan's life since his first album. "I did a tour, going into show biz..." he explains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.francesoir.fr/loisirs/musique/orelsan-attention-au-chant-des-sirenes-141584.html |title=Orelsan<U+00A0>: Attention au "Chant des Sir<U+00E8>nes" |publisher=France Soir |date=27 September 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2014}} {{fr}}</ref>

|I inflicted a discipline of work on myself. I worked hard. I never went out. (...) I didn't see my friends for some time. I isolated myself at the countryside for a week. Writing, for me, is neither simple nor natural. I had to push. It doesn't come by yourself. The first stage was to find out what I was going to talk about. Once I found the subject, I had to determine what I was going to say and finally look for the rhymes. I can't do it as a hobby. On my first album, I wrote certain songs quickly like "Soir<U+00E9>e rat<U+00E9>e", but it's rare. On this album, I was more demanding, more ambitious.<ref name="Express">{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/musique/orelsan-ecrire-pour-mylene-farmer-ou-johnny-hallyday-ce-serait-un-super-challenge_1034262.html |title=Orelsan: "Ecrire pour Myl<U+00E8>ne Farmer ou Johnny Hallyday ce serait un super challenge" |publisher=[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]] |date=28 September 2011 |author=Julien Bordier |accessdate=24 March 2014}} {{fr}}</ref>

I didn't know what to talk about anymore. In my first album, I talked about the previous ten years of my life, and at the time I almost never lived at all: I did a tour, sparked a controversy and banged three groupies (laughs). On the first album, I wrote fourteen songs and didn't touch up anything. I threw about thirty songs in the bin before finding this mix of rapping and singing, this mix of myself and someone I'm not. I also introduced more fiction, something that I wouldn't do before. I confined myself at home, I went on vacations alone. I was at times very depressed.<ref name="INROCK2">{{cite web|url=http://www.lesinrocks.com/actualite/actu-article/t/71591/date/2011-10-16/article/baise-moi-sale-pute/ |title="Baise-moi"/"Sale pute": rencontre entre Orelsan et Virginie Despentes" |publisher=Les Inrocks |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2014}} {{fr}}</ref>

The album's title song "Le chant des sir<U+00E8>nes", as Orelsan explains, was "a breaking point".

{{Centered pull quote
|I already created the beginning of the album. "Le chant des sir<U+00E8>nes" helped me from the end because it talks about reality mixed with fiction. I told myself: "It's not bad to release a bit of myself and add a bit of fiction." Before I could spend 10 hours in front of a blank sheet wondering, "What am I going to do?" Now, I don't hesitate to read a book, to watch a film without feeling like stealing something from someone. I just take impression. I don't hesitate to call a friend, to ask him what he's doing. And in my head, I do a sort of interview to look for inspiration. Before, I had a sort of ego. I had to invent everything.
|author=Orelsan |source=on the song "Le chant des sir<U+00E8>nes".<ref name="Express" />}}

The song "La petite marchande de portes-clefs" is one that "dragged on for a long time".

{{Centered pull quote
|It started with an instrumental that I made. I make them but they rarely land on my discs. I sampled some Chinese thing. I didn't know what to say about it too much. I came across a report on the post-[[2008 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games in Beijing]] and what happened to people there, people who were exploited. I also saw something on the kidnappings of children in China. I imagined the destiny of a girl my age who would've lived all that. I did some research. Well, I wasn't going to the library. I read articles on the one-child policy in China, the Chinese in Paris. I tried to make credible fiction of it, without it being too inflated and too factual. I made something sad and a bit wicked out of it on these people who we come across in the subway at times without knowing where they're coming from.
|author=Orelsan |source=on the song "La petite marchande des portes-clefs".<ref name="Express" />}}

For the track "1990", which was initially called "Dans les ann<U+00E9>es 1990" ("In the 1990s"), Orelsan wanted to "try and write a track today with references of the time." He says that "in these times, there's a tendency of returning to the rap of those years."<ref name="Express"/>

On the song "[[Suicide social]]", which was released as a single on September 15, 2011 before the album's release, Orelsan explains:

{{Centered pull quote
|Suicide social is really a series of clich<U+00E9>s. I would have been able to make the song last 4 minutes more. For me, talking about people as groups, as social classes, as layers, is bullshit. The song is to be taken as an example of what not to do. It's funny, because certain commentaries say: "He understood everything except when he talks about this or that". But they're clich<U+00E9>s. (...) There's going to be reactions. But I wasn't arguing, I wasn't reacting. I'd like people to discuss it amongst themselves. It's just a song. When I started writing it, it made me think of [[Spike Lee]]'s movie ''[[25th Hour]]''. In one scene Edward Norton has a go at all of New York' social classes, except he's more violent than me. And in the end, he tells himself: "If I get angry with them, it's because I'm angry with myself." My persona, him, commits suicide at the end of the song. Nobody's ever offended by the scene from Spike Lee's movie. Why do they have to be offended by mine? Not only that, it's fiction, but not even a point of view.

''Le chant des sir<U+00E8>nes'' has received generally positive reviews from [[music critic]]s. For <U+00C9>ric Mandel of ''Journal du Dimanche'', Orelsan "drives the point home with a stunning song: "Suicide social". It alternates trash humour and existential questions, homage to the origins of rap and the art of storytelling."<ref name="JDD">{{cite web|url=http://www.lejdd.fr/Culture/Musique/Actualite/Orelsan-toujours-sans-concessions-394781/ |title=Orelsan enfonce le clou |publisher=Journal du Dimance |date=24 September 2011 |author=<U+00C9>ric Mandel |accessdate=24 March 2014}} {{fr}}</ref> Musical blog ''Go<U+00FB>te Mes Disques'' says, "''Le chant des sir<U+00E8>nes'' appears as a light and shade: an album punctuated by some flashes of genius and, unfortunately, also by several tracks that could be described as rather ordinary."<ref name="GMD">{{cite web|url=http://www.goutemesdisques.com/chroniques/album/le-chant-des-sirenes/ |title=Le chant des sir<U+00E8>nes |publisher=Go<U+00FB>te Mes Disques |date=20 October 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2014}} {{fr}}</ref> Thierry Cadet of ''Pure Charts'' says the album is "written in bitterness, sparing no one."

According to ''D<U+00E9>sinvolt'', since Orelsan released his first album, "time did its course, the artist came of age and on ''Le chant des sir<U+00E8>nes'', the themes approached become more personal, more thoughtful, evolution is assumed until the end and finally it is all of his work which gains depth."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.desinvolt.fr/2011/10/27/16228-orelsan-le-chant-des-sirenes/ |title=Chronique - Orelsan <U+2013> Le Chant Des Sir<U+00E8>nes |publisher=D<U+00E9>sinvolt |date=27 October 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2014}} {{fr}}</ref>

On 3 March 2012, ''Le chant des sir<U+00E8>nes'' won the [[Victoire de la Musique]] award for Urban Music Album of the Year.
