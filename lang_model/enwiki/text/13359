The {{nihongo|'''Japanese Wolf'''|<U+72FC> or <U+304A><U+304A><U+304B><U+307F>|<U+014C>kami}} refers to two [[extinct]] [[subspecies]] of the grey [[wolf]]. The subspecies that the name 'Japanese Wolf' usually describes is the '''Honsh<U+016B> Wolf''' ({{nihongo|''Canis lupus hodophilax''|<U+65E5><U+672C><U+72FC> or <U+306B><U+307B><U+3093><U+304A><U+304A><U+304B><U+307F>|Nihon <U+014C>kami}}), which occupied the islands of [[Honsh<U+016B>]], [[Shikoku]], and [[Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>]] in [[Japan]]. It is thought to have become extinct due to a combination of [[rabies]], which was first reported in Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B> and Shikoku in 1732, and human eradication. The last known specimen died in 1905, in [[Nara Prefecture]].

Some interpretations of the Honsh<U+016B> Wolf's extinction stress the change in local perceptions of the animal: rabies-induced aggression and [[deforestation]] of the wolf's habitat forced them into conflict with humans, and this led to them being targeted by farmers.<ref>{{cite web | last = Knight | first = John | year = 2004 | url = http://www.wolfsongalaska.org/Wolves_Japan_on_extct.htm | title =  On the Extinction of the Japanese Wolf | accessdate = 2006-06-15}}</ref>

There are currently eight known [[fur|pelts]] and five stuffed specimens of the Japanese Wolf in existence. One stuffed specimen is in the [[Netherlands]], three are in Japan, and the animal caught in 1905 is kept in the [[British Museum]]. Owing to its small size (the Honsh<U+016B> Wolf is the smallest known variety of wolf, probably due to [[allopatric speciation]] / [[island dwarfing]]) the Honsh<U+016B> Wolf's classification as a subspecies of the grey wolf is disputed. 

The other [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] wolf of Japan was the '''Ezo Wolf''' ({{nihongo|''[[Canis]] lupus hattai''|<U+8766><U+5937><U+72FC>|Ezo-<U+014D>kami}}), also known as the '''Hokkaido Wolf''', which occupied the island of [[Hokkaid<U+014D>]] in [[Japan]]. The Ezo Wolf was larger than the Honsh<U+016B> Wolf, more closely approaching the size of a regular grey wolf. The Ezo Wolf reportedly became extinct in 1889 as a result of deliberate [[strychnine]] poisoning by [[farmer]]s.

The Japanese Wolf was afforded a benign, rather than malignant, place in Japanese mythology and religion: the clan leader [[Fujiwara no Hidehira]] was said to have been raised by wolves, and the wolf is often symbolically linked with mountain [[kami]] in [[Shinto]] (the most famous example being the wolf kami of [[Mitsumine Shrine]] in the town of [[Chichibu, Saitama|Chichibu]] in [[Saitama Prefecture]]).

Sightings of the Japanese Wolf have been claimed from the time of its extinction to the present day, but none of these have been verified (see [[cryptozoology]]).<ref> {{cite web | last = Hall | first = Jamie | year = 2005 | url = http://www.newanimal.org/japwolf.htm | title = The Cryptid Zoo: Japanese Dwarf Wolf (or Shamanu) | accessdate = 2006-06-15}}</ref>
