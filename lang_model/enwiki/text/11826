"'''Head Like a Hole'''" is a song by the American [[industrial rock]] project [[Nine Inch Nails]]. A song influenced by [[industrial metal]] group [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], it was released as the second single from the group's debut album ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]''. The song received an almost overwhelmingly positive response from critics, and has been noted as the best track on the album.

"Head Like a Hole" was Nine Inch Nails' first single to chart on [[Hot 100 Singles Sales]] and enjoyed heavy rotation on the radio at the time. It has also been covered by [[New Wave music|New Wave]] band [[Devo]], Christian rock band [[Showbread (band)|Showbread]], indie rock band [[Honest Bob and the Factory-to-Dealer Incentives]], [[punk rock]] band [[AFI (band)|AFI]] and [[nu metal]] band [[Korn]].

==Recording==
[[Trent Reznor]] wrote "Head Like a Hole" in 1988, after touring with [[Skinny Puppy]]. [[Flood (producer)|Flood]], [[Adrian Sherwood]], and [[Keith LeBlanc]] were co-producers of the song, and it was recorded in 1989.<ref name="HLAH notes">''Head Like a Hole'' (Maxi) ([[TVT Records]], March 22, 1990) liner notes and artwork</ref>

The title of the song comes from a sample of a [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] concert in 1987, which Reznor recorded on a [[VHS|video tape]] [[camera]] and later used in the song's production.{{fact|date=January 2011}} The name of his project, [[Nine Inch Nails]], which according to Reznor has no "literal meaning,"<ref name = "Axcess">{{Cite journal
  | title = Talking about Nothing with Trent Reznor
  | journal = Axcess
  | volume = 2
  | year = 1994}}</ref> was also taken from the same tape, during a portion where [[Al Jourgensen]] compares Ministry to a man having a big nail hammered in his head to create a hole there:

<blockquote>"Listening to Ministry is like having a nine inch nail hammered into your head like a hole."{{Fact|date=January 2011}}</blockquote>

==Music and lyrics==
[[Image:Ministry Sweden Rock 2008.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], pictured preforming in the [[Sweden Rock Festival]] in the year 2008, was the inspiration for "Head Like a Hole".]]
Although classified as a [[industrial rock]] song, the song takes its influence from Ministry, as well as the [[thrash metal]] genre.{{fact|date=January 2011}} The tempo is 115 [[tempo|BPM]], and it is played in the tuning of E.<ref name="HLAH notes" /> 

"Head Like a Hole" begins with fast-paced drumming before the verses start. Reznor's vocals begin at 0:42, and are harsher in the choruses and second verse. The song ends with a outro that segues into "[[Terrible Lie]]". Lyrics to the song are a fictional relationship between Reznor and "Godmoney."<ref name="Allmusic Head Like a Hole">[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r171811|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( Head Like a Hole [US&#93; > Overview )))<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The chords of this song are similar to NIN's debut single, "[[Down in It]]". In contrast to "Down in It", "Head Like a Hole" has a longer intro, lasts roughly one minute more than that song, is more aggressive than it, uses a faster tempo, and has no rapping. "Head Like a Hole" is also the opening track on Nine Inch Nails' 1989 debut, and is one of the two NIN songs produced by Flood to appear on that album.<ref>''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' (TVT Records, October 23, 1989) booklet; liner notes</ref>

A well-known line in the song, "You're going to get what you deserve," is a [[recurring]] element in a number of Trent Reznor-written songs, both in same and altered forms. For example, in ''[[Year Zero]]'' (2007) track "Meet Your Master", the first verse ends with the same line, quickly before the chorus begins.<ref>''[[Year Zero]]'' ([[Interscope Records]], April 17, 2007) booklet; "Meet Yout Master" lyrics.</ref>

==Release and reception==
{{double image|right|Opal Armband 800pix.jpg|200|Clay-ss-2005.jpg|200|The "Opal" remix was named after the [[mineraloid]] form [[Opal|of the same name]], while the "Clay" remix after the naturally occurring [[aluminium silicate]] [[clay|with the same subtitle]].}}
Labeled as "[[Nine Inch Nails discography#Halo numbers|Halo 3]]," ''Head Like a Hole'' is the third official Nine Inch Nails release, containing remixes of three different songs from ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]''. The single release is longer in duration than the album itself. The single peaked at #28 on the ''[[Billboard Modern Rock Tracks]]'' chart.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.vnuArtistId=5315&model.vnuAlbumId=12508 Billboard.com] "Artist History"</ref>

{{double image|left|Stagnogley.JPG|200|NatCopper.jpg|200|Taking their subnames from the [[chemical element]] with the '''[[Copper|Cu]]''' symbol and the [[soil]] subject respectively, "Head Like a Hole (Copper)" and "Head Like a Hole (Soil)" are the longest remixes of "Head Like a Hole".}}
A three-track version of this single was released in the UK. This version contains "Head Like a Hole (Opal)", which is not included on the US release, and starts using the beginning of "Tamborine" by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], taken from his album ''[[Around the World in a Day]]''; it continues using a drum loop sampled from "Release It" taken from another [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] record, ''[[Graffiti Bridge (album)|Graffiti Bridge]]''.{{fact|date=January 2011}} The saxophone in "Release It" can be heard before the drum loop begins. "Head Like A Hole (Copper)" samples the looping drum beat from "[[Body Language (Queen song)|Body Language]]", by [[Queen (band)|Queen]].{{fact|date=January 2011}} The first track is mistakenly listed as "Head Like a Hole (Slate)" on the CD.<ref name="HLAH notes" /> "Down in It (Shred)" and "Down in It (Singe)" were previously released on the ''[[Down in It]]'' single. The latter track has been extended by 18 seconds. The unlisted eleventh track is [[Kelly Ripa]] yelling "Let's hear it for Nine Inch Nails! Woo! They're good!" This is a sample from ''[[Dance Party USA]]'' during an appearance by the band on the show.

[[Image:SlateUSGOV.jpg|right|thumb|"Head Like a Hole"'s "Slate" remix, the shortest of the track's mixes, had its subtitle taken from the homogeneous [[metamorphic rock]] [[Slate|of the same name]].]]
The 11-track [[United States|US]] version of the single has recently been re-packaged and re-released. This version was also released in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where it failed to reach the [[Top 40]]<ref name="guinness">{{cite web

 | accessdate = 2007-09-28}}</ref> Finally, in [[Germany]], the single was released as "You Get What You Deserve." This release includes four tracks.

In a retrospective review of the song, [[Allmusic]] described "Head Like a Hole" as "grand theater", elaborating further by saying the "backing music was immaculately crafted and produced".<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=song|id=t1074993|pure_url=yes}} allmusic<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In its review of the single, Allmusic was largely positive towards the song selection, even saying that the inclusion of "Head Like a Hole", "Terrible Lie", and "Down in It" "renders ''Pretty Hate Machine'' mostly unnecessary". As for the other tracks included on the single, Allmusic was less positive, saying "This is one case where quality definitely would have sufficed without the quantity."<ref name="Allmusic Head Like a Hole" />

==Music video==
A [[music video]] was made for the "Clay" remix of this song. It was directed by Eric Zimmerman, released in March 1990 and later in 1997 on the ''[[Closure (Nine Inch Nails VHS)|Closure]]'' VHS. The video became popular on [[MTV]] and helped fuel NIN's early success. A slightly different edit of the video was also released for [[Flood (producer)|Flood]]'s remix of the song, which is 17 seconds shorter than the "Clay" remix. The video features band members [[Trent Reznor]], [[Richard Patrick]] and [[Chris Vrenna]] along with guest drummer [[Martin Atkins]] performing in a cage.{{Fact|date=January 2011}}

In the beginning of the video, a visual [[black]] and [[white]] sample of a person hopping on one foot while spinning a tall stick fades in and out for a couple times againist a background of "blurred colors." A distorted video of walking [[football]] players is also featured. Clips of Reznor putting his head in a [[bucket]] of water, and a person using the same bucket to make Reznor wet, were taken by a [[video camera]] before filming a performance of the song from [[Nine Inch Nails live performances|Nine Inch Nails as a live band]].<ref name="HLAH Everything2.com">[http://everything2.com/title/Head%20Like%20a%20Hole Head Like a Hole at Everything2.com]</ref>

The guitar Reznor used in the video is a [[Jackson Guitars|Jackson]]. It is first seen in first chorus, when Reznor, appearing to be messy like the other band members (Reznor had [[long hair]] and wore dirty [[clothing]] during production), [[Headbanging|bangs his head]] twice while singing the song. He doesn't use the guitar for the climax of the video, where wires tied to him slowly pull him up, leaving Reznor spinning around upsidedown in insane movements. At the same point, Vrenna destroys his [[drum kit]] by throwing a [[bass drum]] of Atkins' drum kit torwards the object. At an earlier shot, broken [[Zildjian]] cymbals and a [[drum machine]] can be seen as parts of Vrenna's kit. Reznor was addicted to the Jackson brand at the time, and he has used many other guitars, many of them which he destroyed. A Jackson guitar that Reznor broke at the end of a [[Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series|February 1991 concert]] was auctioned on [[eBay]] at the price of [[United States dollar|US$]]1,900 dollars, and was sold in early 2009.<ref>{{Cite journal|last= Brock |first= Thiessen |authorlink= Brock Thiessen |title= Broken Nine Inch Nails Guitar Up For Sale On eBay |journal= [[Exclaim!]] |day= 4 |month= December |year= 2008}}</ref> The guitars that he uses for the majority of Nine Inch Nails' music are manufactured by [[Paul Reed Smith]] Guitars. Patrick uses a similar guitar in the video, eventually singing backing vocals for "Head Like a Hole's"  second chorus in the video, though his voice is not heard in the final version. 

There are screens that are shown very quickly like "[[Head|HEAD]]," "16 [[Soundtrack|SOUND]] START," "S M P T E [[Politics|UNIVERSAL LEADER]]" and "[[Film|PICTURE]]." Other images included a white dot set againist a black background, a mirrored presentation showing the words "[[Camera|REEL]] <U+2116> [[Filmmaking|PROD]] <U+2116> [[Theater|PLAY]] [[Calendar|DATE]]" colored in [[yellow]], one with the words "[[Introduction|PICTURE START]]," and a frame consisting of "C C F F" placed near a outlined ring. The latter screen had an alternative version that was accompanied by a white number [[3 (number)|3]], also seen in the video. There are also visuals of four incomplete rotating mechanical models of human heads; one with [[film stills]], another with [[computer hardware]] and a modified [[motherboard]], the purple but partly [[wire]]d head with a small screen showing a person's eye and other technology, and the last containing blue skin, red-pupil eyes, and a [[lightbulb]]. The former two were filmed in [[Black and white film|black and white]], while the latter two in [[Colorization|full color]]. All four are shown intercut with shots of people spinning [[baseball]] bats.<ref name="HLAH Everything2.com" />

==Live performances==
[[Image:Trent Reznor Lollapalooza 1991.jpg|right|thumb|The preformance of "Head Like a Hole" on the [[Jane's Addiction]]-curated [[Lollapalooza]] festival was one of most notable moments of the concerts of Nine Inch Nails.]]
The song has been the set closer for most NIN shows, or the last song before the encore if an encore took place. After the song was performed, band members destroy their instruments. A reference to this is mentioned in the title of ''[[Broken (EP)|Broken]]'' (1992), Nine Inch Nails' second major studio relase. There are live videos of "Head Like a Hole" on the DVDs ''[[And All That Could Have Been]]'' and ''[[Beside You in Time]]''.<ref>[http://halo22.nin.com/tracklisting.html] ''Beside You in Time'' tracklisting</ref>

==Legacy==
Since its commercial maxi-single release, "Head Like a Hole" continues to generate a impact on other musicians and bands. [[New Zealand]]-based [[grunge]] band [[HLAH]] is titled after the song, the band name is sometimes abbreviated in order to avoid [[copyright infringement]] issues. The act, consisting of Andrew Durno, Tom Watson, Mark Hamill, Booga Beazley, Nigel Regan, and Michael Franklin-Browne, was nonetheless initially short-lived, being formed in 1992 and disbanding in 2000. However, they reunited in 2009<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominionpost/4709137a23882.html Dominion Post - Head Like a Hole reunite, 29 Sep 2008]</ref><ref>[http://www.therock.net.nz/Home/tabid/36/articleID/2510/cat/6/Default.aspx#feature HLAH tour 2009]</ref> and recorded a new album, titled ''[[Sword of Theives]]'', for a 2011 release date. They have released four studio albums so far; ''[[13 (HLAH album)|13]]'' in 1992, ''[[Flik Y'Self Off Y'Self]]'' in 1994 (the same year where NIN's ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'' was released), ''[[Double Your Strength, Improve Your Health, & Lengthen Your Life]]'' in 1996, and ''[[Are You Gonna Kiss It Or Shoot It?]]'' in 1998.

There has been covers of the song as well. In 2005, [[The String Quartet Tribute]] released an [[cover album]] of reworked versions of ''Pretty Hate Machine'', including "Head Like a Hole". It is the most widely covered Nine Inch Nails song. Bands who covered the track include [[punk rock]] band [[AFI (band)|AFI]],{{Fact|date=March 2011}} [[alternative rock]] band [[Dark Horse]],{{Fact|date=March 2011}} [[New Wave music|new wave]] band [[Devo]]]],{{Fact|date=March 2011}} [[indie rock]] band [[Honest Bob and the Factory-to-Dealer Incentives]],{{Fact|date=March 2011}} [[gothic metal]] band [[Lullacry]],{{Fact|date=March 2011}} [[nu metal]] band [[Korn]],<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003614268 Billboard]</ref> [[Post-industrial music|post-industrial]] [[KMFDM]] side project [[PIG (musical project)|Pig]],{{Fact|date=March 2011}} and [[Christian rock]] band [[Showbread (band)|Showbread]].{{Fact|date=March 2011}}
