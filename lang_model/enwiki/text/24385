==History==

St Mary's was built as the church to a [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] priory.  This was established in the late 12th&nbsp;century, but the main part of the present church dates from the 14th<U+2013>15th&nbsp;century.  The [[Domesday Book|Domesday Survey]] records a church dedicated to the Holy Cross in the town, and it is thought that St Mary's stands on the site of an earlier [[Saxon architecture|Saxon]] church.  The priory was closed in 1536 as a result of the [[dissolution of the monasteries]], St Mary's became a [[parish church]], and a [[grammar school]] was established in one of the priory's chapels.<ref name=worship>{{Citation | url = http://www.bungay-suffolk.co.uk/community/worship.asp| title = Churches in Bungay: St Mary's Church| accessdate = 7&nbsp;March 2011| publisher = Sanderling Internet}}</ref>  In 1577 the church was struck by lightning, and this event led to the ''Legend of the Black Dog'' (see below).<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | publication-date = | date = 13 April 2010| year = | title = Bungay: History of Bungay| periodical = EDP24 | series = | publication-place = | place = | publisher = Archant Regional| volume = | issue = | pages = | url = http://www.edp24.co.uk/norfolk-life/village-guide/bungay_1_213335| archiveurl = | archivedate = | issn = | pmid = | pmc = | doi = | oclc = | accessdate =7&nbsp;March 2011}}</ref><ref name=legend/> 

The church was damaged in a great fire in the town in 1688.  The roof of the south [[aisle]] and some of the fittings, including benches and possibly the [[pulpit]], were burnt, but the roof of the [[nave]] was not damaged.<ref name=hist>{{citation |url= |title= |accessdate= |last= Suckling|first= Alfred  |work= The History and Antiquities of the County of Suffolk|volume = 1|year=1846|series =  |publisher= University of London & History of Parliament Trust |pages= }}</ref>  The south aisle was re-roofed in 1699, and the church re-opened in 1701.<ref name=hg/>  In 1879 the tower was repaired, and the rest of the church was restored, at a cost of <U+00A3>3,000 (<U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|3000|1879|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=-4}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}}<ref name=kelly>{{Citation | url = http://apling.freeservers.com/Villages/Bungay.htm| title = Kelly's Directory for Cambridgeshire, Norfolk & Suffolk, 1883 |pages=824<U+2013>828 |chapter= Suffolk <U+2014> Bungay | accessdate = 7&nbsp;March 2011| publisher = [[Kelly's Directory]]}}</ref>  During the 20th&nbsp;century the size of the congregation declined and the church was declared redundant.<ref name=worship/>   Its [[benefice]] has been united with that of Holy Trinity Church.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.achurchnearyou.com/bungay-holy-trinity-st-mary/| title = Bungay, Holy Trinity with St Mary, Bungay| accessdate = 7&nbsp;March 2011| publisher = [[Church of England]]}}</ref>  A society, The Friends of St Mary's, cleans the church and organises concerts and other events in the church.<ref name=worship/>

==Architecture==
===Exterior===
The church is constructed in [[flint]] and stone in [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]] style.  Its plan consists of a nave with a [[clerestory]], north and south aisles, and a tower.<ref name=kelly/>  The tower stands at the west end of the south aisle,<ref name=hist/> and it is surmounted by four tall [[crocket]]ted [[pinnacle]]s.  There is no [[chancel]].<ref name=kelly/>  The tower is {{convert|110|ft|m|1}} high.<ref name=cct/>  There are ruined remains of the priory in the churchyard to the east of the church.<ref name=cct/>

===Interior===
The [[arcade (architecture)|arcades]] are supported on five columns consisting of clustered shafts.<ref name=hist/>  The west window is particularly large, and has complicated [[tracery]] in its upper part.  The [[boss (architecture)|bosses]] in the roof are carved with a variety of objects, including angels, a lion, two-headed eagles, and a bat.  Near the entrance to the church is a dole cupboard, carved with a rat.  Bread was placed in the dole cupboard to be given to the poor.  Part of the church has been converted into a War Memorial Chapel.  This contains a 17th-century Flemish panel depicting the [[Resurrection#Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] that was given to the church by the author [[H. Rider Haggard]].<ref name=cct/>  The two-[[manual (music)|manual]] organ was made by E.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Norman, and was moved to the church from Rose Hall, Bungay.  It was rebuilt in 1961 by Walker.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=N00899 | title = Suffolk, Bungay, St. Mary, St. Mary's Street (N00899)| accessdate = 7&nbsp;March 2011| publisher = [[British Institute of Organ Studies]]}}</ref>  The [[ring of bells|ring]] consists of eight bells, all cast in 1820 by Thomas Mears&nbsp;II of the [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=bungay&Submit=+Go+&DoveID=BUNGAY| title = Bungay, S Mary| accessdate = 7&nbsp;March 2011| publisher = [[Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers]]}}</ref>

==Legend of the Black Dog==
The church was struck by lightning on Sunday, 4&nbsp;August 1577.  During the thunderstorm an apparition appeared, consisting of a black [[Hellhound|Hell Hound]] which dashed around the church, attacking members of the congregation.  It then suddenly disappeared and re-appeared in [[Blythburgh#The Church of Holy Trinity|Blythburgh church]] {{convert|12|mi|km|0}} away, injuring members of the congregation there.  The dog has been associated with [[Black Shuck]], a dog haunting the coasts of [[Norfolk]], [[Essex]] and Suffolk.  An image of the Black Dog has been incorporated in the [[coat of arms]] of Bungay, and has been used in the titles of various enterprises associated with Bungay.<ref name=legend>{{Citation | url = http://www.bungay-suffolk.co.uk/bungay/black-dog-legend.asp| title = History of the Black Dog of Bungay| accessdate = 7&nbsp;March 2011| publisher = Sanderling Internet}}</ref>
