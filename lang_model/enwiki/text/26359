"'''Express Yourself'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] from her fourth studio album ''[[Like a Prayer]]''. It was released as the second single from the album on May 9, 1989, by [[Sire Records]]. The song was included on the greatest hits compilation albums ''[[The Immaculate Collection]]'' (1990), and ''[[Celebration (Madonna album)|Celebration]]'' (2009). "Express Yourself" was the first song that Madonna and producer [[Stephen Bray]] collaborated for ''Like a Prayer''. Written and produced by them, the song was a tribute to American [[funk]] and [[soul music|soul]] band [[Sly and the Family Stone]]. The main inspiration behind the song is female empowerment, urging women never to go for second-best and to always express their inner feelings.

"Express Yourself" is an upbeat [[dance-pop]] song that takes its main theme from the 1965 song "[[Respect (song)|Respect]]" by [[Otis Redding]]. it features instrumentation from [[brass]], hand claps and [[drum machine|drum beats]], while the chorus is backed by the sound of [[saxophone]] and [[percussion]]. The lyrics talk about rejecting material pleasures and only accepting the best for oneself; [[subtext]]s are employed throughout the song. "Express Yourself" received positive reviews from critics, who applauded the gender equality message of the song and complimented the song for being a hymn to freedom and and encouragement to women and all oppressed minorities. The song was also a commercial success, reaching the top of the charts in Canada, Europe, Italy and Switzerland and top-five in other nations, except France, where the song was not released.

The accompanying [[music video]], directed by [[David Fincher]], was inspired by the [[Fritz Lang]] classic film ''[[Metropolis (film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927). It had a total budget of $5&nbsp;million, which made it the most expensive music video in history at the time it was made, and currently [[List of most expensive music videos|the third most expensive of all time]]. The video portrayed a city full of tall skyscrapers and railway lines. Madonna played the part of a glamorous lady and chained masochist, with muscular men acting as her workers. In the end, she picks one of them<U+2014>played by model [[Cameron Alborzian]]<U+2014>as her date for the night. Critics noted the video for its exploitation of female sexuality and came to the conclusion that Madonna's masculine image in the video as gender-bending.

"Express Yourself" has been performed majorly on three of Madonna's world tours, and has been covered by the female leads of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] TV show ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', who performed the song in the episode titled "[[The Power of Madonna]]". The song and the video is noted for its freedom expression and [[feminism|feminist]] aspects, and its postmodern nature entranced academics, by resisting definition. It has also left its mark on the work of contemporary music artists, including [[Melanie C]] of the [[Spice Girls]], [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Lady Gaga]].

The message of the song is that people should always say what it is they want. The reason relationships don't work is because they are afraid. That's been my problem in all my relationships. I'm sure people see me as an outspoken person, and for the most part, if I want something I ask for it. But sometimes you feel that if you ask for too much or ask for the wrong thing from someone you care about that that person won't like you. And so you censor yourself. I've been guilty of that in every meaningful relationship I've ever had. The time I learn how not to edit myself will be the time I consider myself a complete adult.

"Express Yourself" was released as the second single from ''Like a Prayer'', on May 9, 1989, with "[[The Look of Love (Madonna song)|The Look of Love]]", from the 1987 film soundtrack ''[[Who's That Girl (soundtrack)|Who's That Girl]]'', on its [[A-side and B-side|B-side]].<ref name="rikky1"/> When Madonna started work on her fourth studio album, ''[[Like a Prayer]]'', she considered many options, and thought about the musical direction for it. She had certain matters on her mind, including her troubled relationship with her ex-husband [[Sean Penn]], her family, her lost mother and even in her beliefs in God.<ref name="tara1">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=168}}</ref> Madonna thought about lyrical ideas for the songs on topics that, until then, were personal mediation never to be shared with her public so openly and pointedly.<ref name="tara1"/> She understood that as she was growing up, so was her fans, and it was time for her to move away from the teen appeal to wider audiences, and en-cash on the longevity of the album market.<ref name="lucy1"/> Madonna wanted her new sound to be calculative and an indication of what was in [[wikt:vogue|vogue]], and the changing trend of music.<ref name="lucy1">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|p=120}}</ref> 

As Madonna considered her alternatives, producers [[Patrick Leonard]] and [[Stephen Bray]] had individually began to tinker with various instrumental tracks and musical ideas to present to her for consideration.<ref name="tara1"/> "Express Yourself" was the first song that Madonna and Bray collaborated for ''Like a Prayer''. Written and produced by them, the song was a tribute to American [[funk]] and [[soul music|soul]] band [[Sly and the Family Stone]].<ref name="rikky1">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=30}}</ref> The main inspiration behind the song is female empowerment, urging women never to "go for second-best" and to put their love "to the test".<ref name="rikky1"/> Madonna explained to Becky Johnston in the June 1989 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'':
<blockquote>
"The ultimate thing behind the song is that if you don't express yourself, if you don't say what you want, then you're not going to get it. And in effect you are chained down by your inability to say what you feel or go after what you want. No matter how in control you think are about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead. Its my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too."<ref name="mick"/>

"Express Yourself" is an upbeat [[dance-pop]] song that takes its main theme from the 1965 song "[[Respect (song)|Respect]]" by [[Otis Redding]]; the cover version of "Respect" by [[Aretha Franklin]] was one of Madonna's favorite songs at that time.<ref name="pere">{{harvnb|Peraino|2006|p=154}}</ref> "Express Yourself" begins with the sound of [[brass]] tinkling along, as Madonna chimes the opening line: "Come on girls, do you believe in love? 'Cause I got something to say about it, And it goes something like this."<ref name="rikky1"/> Handclaps and drum beats start as Madonna moves into the [[refrain|chorus]] of the song, with a thick vocal texture and high-pitched background singing. The chorus is aided by instrumentation from a [[saxophone]] and [[percussion]]. Madonna then sings the first [[verse (popular music)|verse]] of the song, as a violin sound is added after she finishes the [[bridge (music)|bridge]], "Make you feel like a queen on the throne, make you love it till you never come down", a male voice repeating the last line.<ref name="rikky1"/> A [[synthesizer]] is played after the second verse as Madonna continues chanting the words "Express yourself" with background vocals singing "Hey, hey, hey, hey" along side her.<ref name="rikky1"/> 

After a small saxophone [[break (music)|interlude]], a break-down comes with Madonna singing in a fuller voice, as horns and percussion beats continue. Madonna changes the lyrics at the end to "express himself", and after another repetition of the bridge and the intermediate verse, the chorus comes where she changes the lyrics back to the original title. The song ends with the words "Respect yourself", fading out.<ref name="rikky1"/> Set within a simple song structure, "Express Yourself" plays with ambiguity through a subtle control of [[harmony]] and the avoidance of diatonic closure. The introduction of the song suggests a [[key (music)|key]] of [[G major]], but the first note of the melody, "don't" in [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]], implies both a minor inflection and lack of tonal stability.<ref name="white">{{harvnb|Whiteley|2000|p=138}}</ref> This is also evident in Madonna's vocal nuance on the words "express yourself", which initially centers on G, before moving down a semitone to [[E minor]].<Ref name="white"/> Per the sheet music published by [[Alfred Publishing|Alfred Publishing Co. Inc.]], "Express Yourself" is set in [[time signature]] of common time, with a [[tempo]] of 120 beats per minute. Madonna's voice range spans from G<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>5</sub> with a [[chord progression]] of G<U+2013>C<U+2013>F<U+2013>C<U+2013>G<U+2013>G{{music|flat}}<U+2013>C.<ref>{{cite web|title=Digital Sheet Music <U+2013> Madonna <U+2013> Express Yourself|last=Ciccone|first=Madonna|last2=Bray|first2=Stephen|year=1989|publisher=Musicnotes.com.

According to Rikky Rooksby, author of ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna'', the lyrics of "Express Yourself" make it a simple love song, with Madonna exhorting the women in her audience not to go for second-best, to express their feelings and get their men to express theirs.<ref name="rikky1"/> [[Lucy O'Brien]], author of ''Madonna: Like an Icon'', described them as a "feminist call-to-arms", with Madonna dismissing the satin sheets and gold baubles of material pleasures.<ref name="lucy">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|p=206}}</ref> As she said in the interview with ''Rolling Stone'', "the lyrics are my way of saying if it doesn't work, then you're better off on your own.

==Critical reception==
[[File:Lucy O'Brien 01.jpg|thumb|Author [[Lucy O'Brien]] praised the song and likened Madonna as a female preacher.]]
"Express Yourself" received mainly positive reviews from critics. [[J. Randy Taraborrelli]], author of ''[[Madonna: An Intimate Biography]]'' called the song a "funky dance anthem" and reacted positively to its message of a "female call-to-arms in communication and self-respect."<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=170}}</ref> [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' observed that Madonna repudiated the philosophy of her previous single "[[Material Girl]]" (1985) in "Express Yourself", which he described as "a 30-year-old's view of life unshadowed by rebellion and lingering lapsed Catholic pain."<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/19/arts/madonna-re-creates-herself-again.html|title=Madonna Re-Creates Herself <U+2013> Again|last=Holden|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Holden|date=1989-03-19|accessdate=2011-01-21|page=5| work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> In another article from the same newspaper, Carn James declared it as one of her most exuberant songs.<ref name="nyt2">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/16/arts/pop-view-beneath-all-that-black-lace-beats-the-heart-of-a-bimbo.html|title=Beneath All That Black Lace Beats the Heart of a Bimbo...|page=2|last=James|first=Caryn|date=1990-12-16|accessdate=2011-07-08|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Santiago Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors of ''Madonna's Drowned Worlds'', complimented the lyrics of the song, and added that it apparently espouses "gender fluidity as a road to gender equality."<ref>{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=26}}</ref> In his book ''Madonna As Postmodern Myth'', journalist [[Georges Claude Guilbert]] described "Express Yourself" as a hymn to freedom, "an encouragement for all women and all oppressed minorities to resist, to express their ideas and their strength faced with tyranny."<ref>{{harvnb|Guilbert|2002|p=120}}</ref> Biographer Mary Cross noted in her book ''Madonna: A Biography'', how the song paved the way for its [[music video]] and became a testament to freedom.<ref>{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=49}}</ref> Authors Allen Metz and Carol Benson noted in their essays on Madonna, how she decimated "patriarchal, racist and capitalist constructions", by the way she pronounced the word "self" in "Express Yourself". They added that the opening line "Don't go for second best, baby" transformed the song into a postmodernist anthem.<ref>{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=223}}</ref> Scholar Sheila Whiteley noted in her book ''Women and popular music: sexuality, identity, and subjectivity'', that Madonna's acknowledgement of the pastiche and of being capable of imitating musical style was interesting to her, but given Madonna's ability to manipulate image, the musical exuberance of "Express Yourself" did not appear surprising.<ref name="white"/> [[Mark Bego]], author of ''Madonna: Blond Ambition'' declared that "the song that most reflected the Madonna everyone had come to know and be shocked by was 'Express Yourself'."<ref>{{harvnb|Bego|2000|p=194}}</ref> O'Brien was impressed with the song, and gave a detailed review:
<blockquote>
"Express Yourself" is a feminist call-to-arms, complete with muscular brass playing and soulful voice. Here Madonna is the anti-materialism girl, exhorting her female audiences to respect themselves. That means having a man who loves your head and your heart. If he doesn't treat you right (and here's the revolutionary rhetoric) you're better off on your own. Like a female preacher, Madonna emphasizes each word of the chorus, invoking God and the power of orgasm. In parts Cosmo-woman, girl-talk, and swinging dance track, it presages the deliciously declarative stance of "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]" and shows Madonna moving from introspective to survivalist mode.<ref name="lucy"/>
</blockquote>
Professor [[Maury Dean]] wrote in his book ''Rock 'n' Roll Gold Rush: A Singles Un-Cyclopedia'', that the main appeal of "Express Yourself" lied in its teen appeal, although he understood that at its core, it was addressing a very important issue of female liberation.<ref>{{harvnb|Dean|2003|p=525}}</ref> Kevin Phinney from ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]'' commented that with "Express Yourself", Madonna struck out her "Material Girl" persona, there by demonstrating once more that no image of her's is concrete.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|last=Whiney|first=Kevin|date=1989-03-22|accessdate=2011-07-07|publisher=[[Cox Enterprises]]|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&p_theme=aasb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAD895970EA30B8&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=`Like A Prayer' gives Madonna a vehicle for confession}}</ref> Based on the lyrics of the song, Ken Blakely of ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' declared the song as a rare example of good taste and good advice from ''Like a Prayer''.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]]|publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]]|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DN&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI|DN&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB29C65B3A2A0DB&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Madonna Writhes Again|date=1989-05-18|accessdate=2011-07-07|last=Blakely|first=Ken}}</ref> Andy Goldberg from ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' was impressed with Madonna's vocals on the song, complimenting the soul inlfluences.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/99163067.html?dids=99163067:99163067&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Apr+07%2C+1989&author=Andy+Goldberg&pub=Jerusalem+Post&desc=MADONNA+SAYS+IT+ALL&pqatl=google|title=Madonna Says It All|date=1989-04-07|accessdate=2011-07-07|last=Goldberg|first=Andy|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|publisher=Mirkaei Tikshoret}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[J.

==Music video==

Fincher liked the concept and it became the main backdrop for the video. In ''Madonna 'talking': Madonna in her own words'', she commented about the development of the video. 
<blockquote>
This one I had the most amount of input. I oversaw everything<U+2014>the building of the sets, everyone's costumes, I had meetings with make-up and hair and the cinematographer, everybody.

Madonna mentioned jokingly in a 1990 [[BBC Television]] interview on the program ''[[Omnibus (UK TV series)|Omnibus]]'', that the main theme of the video and the cat metaphor represented that "Pussy rules the world".<ref>{{cite episode|title=[[Omnibus (UK TV series)|BBC Omnibus Madonna Special]]|airdate=1990-08-10|credits=Presenter: [[Barry Norman]]|time=19:29|network=[[BBC Television]]|city=London|transcript=broadcast|season=24|seriesno=|quote=The video means, 'Pussy rules the world!|series=Omnibus|serieslink=Omnibus (UK TV series)}}</ref> She added that the idea of the cat licking the milk and then pour it over, was the director's. "It's great but believe me I fought him on that. I didn't want to do it. I thought it's just so over the top and silly and kind of cliched, an art student or a film student's kind of trick.

===Synopsis===
[[File:Expressyourselfmusicvideo.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Madonna portraying a masculine persona in the music video for "Express Yourself".]]
The video opens with the view of a city populated with skyscrapers, intermingling railway lines and aero-crafts. Steam blows out of the funnels of a factory as big machines are shown. Madonna appears on the back of a statue of a swan, and utters the line: "Come on girls, do you believe in love?" This is followed by the chorus, showing the interiors of the factory where the workers slave at the machines, as rain pour incessantly on them. Amidst the smoke filled environment, the chiseled torso of the male workers are shown, as they strip off their shirts. Madonna is then shown in a light-green gown, holding a black cat in her lap, looking across the factory from her sitting room. As she sings the first verse, the workers perform choreographed dance routine inside the factory. Madonna lays down on a sofa and the cat escapes from her lap, as her singing reaches the owner of the factory, through a series of speakers. He becomes nervous hearing her voice and looks down to find one of the worker staring up and looking for the source of the voice.

With the beginning of the second verse, Madonna moves into her bedroom, wearing a black corset and stockings. She moves behind white screens and dances in suggestive manner, her silhouette reflecting it from the other side of the screens. In the meantime the worker continues to think about Madonna's voice and dreams of her eyes amidst smokes. He then sees Madonna standing atop a long flight of stairs inside the factory, wearing a pinstripe suit and displaying a monocle glass. She dances on a platform, holding her crotch sometimes, as two men pull at levers beside the steps. In the meantime, the owner of the factory listens to live musicians in his room, as Madonna is shown lying naked on her bed, with one end of a chain attached to her neck, the other end going long down into the factory. As the owner leers at the musicians in the room, the worker is shown caressing Madonna's cat, while looking up expectantly towards her room.

As the final verse of the song begins, Madonna is shown crawling on the floor among her furniture, the scene interspersed with Madonna sitting on a sofa and smoking. The worker ultimately gets up from his bed and walks towards Madonna's room as she reaches for a bowl of milk, and licks it like a cat. She pours it over her shoulder and it reaches the worker's face, who travels up the building in an elevator. A boxing match starts among the other workers of the factory, as Madonna is shown sitting naked on her bed. The worker reaches her room and takes her into his arm, as the door closes behind them. The video ends with a last shot of the city-line, with Madonna's eyes above the sky, and the epigraph on top of a series of gears.

===Reception and analysis===
Authors Santiago Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez and Freya Jarman-Ivens commented that "the video portrayed the deconstructive gender-bending approach associated with free play and self-reflexivity of images in postmodernism." They had initially thought the video as a feminist approach to sexuality, leading them to say that "the video might also relate to several core political questions raised by feminism."<ref name="fouz26">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern<U+00E1>ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=26}}</ref> However, they deduced that the scenes showing Madonna in a seductive manner and chained to her bed do not portray women in an empowering position, but emphasizes the fact that women can be in control because of their sexual prowess.<ref name="fouz26"/> Jarman-Ivens added that the epigraph establishes the status-quo, with a clear distinction of the body (workers, hand, labors) and the mind (elite, intellect capital). Unlike ''Metropolis'', where the line denoted the binary oppositions of the labor class against the elitist, in the video Madonna did not distinguish between the two. Jarman-Ivens noted that the video portrayed both men and women being looked at, actively or passively. The body and the hand are not separate there, instead the heart, hand and head are portrayed as a balance in everybody, male or female.<ref name="fouz26"/> Scholar Theodore Gracyk also noted of the initial portrayal of female sexuality in the video, in his book, ''I Wanna Be Me: Rock Music and the Politics of Identity'', and criticized the video for its portrayal of male domination. However, on close inspection, Gracyk came to the conclusion that "Express Yourself" was a smart move for Madonna, as it actually portrayed women in a much stronger position.<ref>{{harvnb|Gracyk|2001|p=187}}</ref> Author John Evan Seery wrote in his book ''Political theory for mortals'', that "Madonna with her 'Express Yourself' video splicing together images of machines with images of sex,... represents the ultimate cyborg of late twentieth-century America."<ref>{{harvnb|Seery|1996|p=38}}</ref> Allen Metz felt that the scenes of Madonna grabbing her crotch and dancing were reminiscent of "[[Michael Jackson]]'s androgynous imitation of phallic masculinity." He went on to compliment the video for its gender-bending depiction.<ref>{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=282}}</ref>

Michelle Gibson and Deborah Townsend Meem, authors of ''Femme/Butch'', commended the video for showing a shift in power between the sexes, declaring that "Madonna assertively claimed all possible gender space like [[Marlene Dietrich]]."<ref>{{harvnb|Gibson|Meem|2002|p=155}}</ref> Professor Carol Vernallis noted in her book, ''Experiencing Music Video'' that the diffused light around Madonna in the video was adopted to mimic the diffusion of sound and make the borders around Madonna appear soft, and her body spread outwards.<ref>{{harvnb|Vernallis|2004|p=178}}</ref> In the book ''The 1980s'', authors Bob Batchelor and Scott Stoddart called "Express Yourself" as one of Madonna's most challenging videos. They noted the video for its "exploitation" of the male body and sexualizing them as an object of desire. The authors also added that the video "was a colorful homage to the term [[gaze]], but Madonna is the bearer of it<U+2014>not men." Batchelor explained that the scenes of Madonna performing alone in her room and atop the stairs suggested that she was the object of the gaze, however it seemed to them that she was mocking the movement of the men below. "She controls the mind of the men below, with a form of siren's song of female empowerment, signalling that the men do move in unison to her song," Stoddart concluded.<ref>{{harvnb|Batchelor|Stoddart|p=120}}</ref> 

Elizabeth Edwards, one of the authors of ''Visual Sense: A Cultural Reader'', explained that the shot of Madonna crawling on the floor, while another image of her's watches from a nearby sofa, illustrated the mutation that Madonna's image was undergoing. According to her, Madonna was acting out self-consciousness by "watching herself". She concluded by saying, "'Express Yourself' gives its viewers a whole new series of image references to traditional American gendered and sexual icons<U+2014>male and female<U+2014>and a whole new level of irony."<ref>{{harvnb|Edwards|Bhaumik|2009|p=266}}</ref> Shari Benstock and Suzanne Ferriss, authors of ''On Fashion'', deconstructed the video for its display of the artificiality of images of gender.<ref>{{harvnb|Benstock|Ferriss|2004|p=176}}</ref> Sal Cinquemani from [[Slant Magazine]] reviewed the video in 2003, and commented that the video "is the embodiment of 'queer chic', a bombastic masterpiece that heralds Madonna's uncanny ability to use her consumer-driven image to code her feminist politics."<ref name="100g">{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/feature/100-greatest-music-videos/205/page_10|title=100 Greatest Music Videos|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|last2=Gonzalez|first2=Ed|date=2003-06-30|accessdate=2011-07-16|publisher=[[Slant Magazine]]}}</ref> At the [[1989 MTV Video Music Awards]], "Express Yourself" was nominated in the categories of [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]], [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]], [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]], winning the last three categories.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_kUaAAAAIBAJ|title=Paula Abdul Tops Music Video Awards|last=Antczak|first=John|date=1989-09-08|accessdate=2011-07-16|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|page=7}}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' also honored the video as the Best Music Video of the year, at their Music Video Awards for 1989.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Peniston Leads Nominees For Billboard Music Video Awards|date=1992-10-17|accessdate=2010-12-07|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|issn=0006-2510|volume=104|issue=42|pages=79}}</ref> The music video of "Express Yourself" is ranked at number one on [[Slant Magazine]]'s "100 Greatest Music Videos".<ref name="100g"/> It is also placed at number ten on both ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s "The 100 Top Music Videos" and [[MTV]]'s "100 Greatest Videos Ever Made", as well as number three on [[MuchMusic]]'s list of "Top 100 Videos of The Century".<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=90}}</ref> David Dale from ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' listed it as one of the Most Influential Videos of All Time, at number 18.<ref name="smh2"/> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine listed it at number eight on their countdown of The 30-All Time Best Music Videos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2085389_2085392_2085369,00.html|title=The 30 All-Time Best Music Videos|last=Levy|first=Glen|date=2011-07-28|accessdate=2011-08-02|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=Time Inc.}}</ref>

==Live performances==
[[File:ReInventionTourMadonnaLicious3.jpg|thumb|250px|Madonna performing "Express Yourself" on the [[Re-Invention Tour]] of 2004 .]]
Madonna's first live performance of "Express Yourself" was at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards. She started the performance by descending from a flight of stairs, wearing a pin-striped suit and a monocle.<ref name="inglis"/> Later she removed the coat to reveal her bustier, and together with her backup singers, performed a dance routine called [[vogue (dance)|voguing]].<ref name="inglis"/> Ian Inglis, author of ''Performance and Popular Music: History, Place and Time'' noted that the historical importance of Madonna's performance at the Video Music Awards was due to the televisual venue. Inglis explained that since Madonna's performance was striking primarily as a high-energy, provocatively choreographed, dance production number, it went on to highlight the 'TV' part of MTV, and in a way heralded her and the network as a cultural arbiter.<ref name="inglis">{{harvnb|Inglis|2006|p=136}}</ref>

Madonna included the song in the [[set list]] of her [[Blond Ambition World Tour]] in 1990, which featured a version based on the Non-Stop Express remix of the song and included lyrics from "[[Everybody (Madonna song)|Everybody]]" during the introduction.<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=431}}</ref> The set was inspired by ''Metropolis'' and the themes were taken from the factory seen in the music video. It included a number of funnels billowing smoke, steel piping, cables hanging above and a flight of stairs in the middle.<ref>{{harvnb|Benstock|Ferriss|2004|p=172}}</ref> As the show started, the set was hurled onstage and Madonna's male dancers, with bare torso, appeared behind the steel structures.

{{triple image|right|MelanieChisholm.jpg|117|Christina Aguilera Sanremo.jpg|117|Lady Gaga EuroPride 2011.jpg|150|"Express Yourself" is notable for its impact on the work of contemporary musical artists, including that of [[Melanie C]] (''left''), [[Christina Aguilera]] (''center'') who paid tribute to the music video with her single "[[Not Myself Tonight]]", and [[Lady Gaga]], whose single "[[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]]" featured a similar theme and musical structure.|||alt|alt|alt}}
"Express Yourself" is noted both for its song and its accompanying music video, both of which is considered a feminist ode to freedom. As author Mar<U+00ED>a Jos<U+00E9> Coperi<U+00E1>s Aguilar wrote in her book ''Culture and Power'', the release of the song was in context of the anti-feminist or the "backlash" ideology dominant in the US, since the rise of the "[[New Right#United States|New Right]]" in the 1980s and the government of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George Bush]].<ref name="aui">{{harvnb|Aguilar|2000|p=83<U+2013>85}}</ref> Aguilar went on to explain that the 1980s and the 1990s were characterized by a conservative reaction against the <U+2018>excesses<U+2019> of the 1960s and 70s. This reaction was channeled mainly by the media<U+2019>s strong attacks against feminism, generally describing activists as "tortured people with hairy legs", "radical, bitter, man-hating, separatist and lesbian", accompanied by messages advocating a feminization of women that turned them into beautiful ornamental objects, and tended to increase the cultural differences between the sexes.<ref name="aui"/> "Express Yourself" appeared as a refutation of some of these reactionary premises. The title, Aguilar noted, seemed to raise the question of the urgency of a feminine voice to develop and emerge<U+2014>a concern that recalled the tradition of French feminists like [[H<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>ne Cixous]] and [[Luce Irigaray]].<ref name="aui"/>

The video stood out conspicuously to Aguilar for its ''chaotic'' texture through the rapid editing of the multiple shots that constituted it. The sudden and continuous changes of camera angles, scenes and the distance and mood seemed to produce an "apparently incoherent combination of images that offered no stable anchor to provide the whole with a definitive interpretation," she added.<ref name="aui"/> Since [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] has traditionally been associated with the female [[ontogenesis|ontogenetic]] principle as opposed to male principle of [[cosmos|order]], the video in turn came to be associated with [[dualism|duality]] between order/chaos, male/femalegood/evil, light/dark etc.<ref name="aui"/> Aguilar also drew parallel between ''Metropolis'' and the music video. Madonna borrowed different phallic symbolism from the film, including the smoke-billowing chimneys, the tall skyscrapers and the oppressive environment of industrial work.<ref name="aui"/> However, unlike ''Metropolis'' which portrayed repression of a rebellious [[proletariat]], the chaotic nature of "Express Yourself" video showed freedom instead.<ref name="aui"/> Caryn James from ''The New York Times'' added that "asked about the video, [Madonna] made a distinction that any honest feminist would respect, however politically incorrect it may seem. 'I have chained myself', she said. 'There wasn't a man that put that chain on me.' You don't have to buy Madonna's next loopy bit of symbolism<U+2014>'I was chained to my desires'<U+2014>to believe the feminist subtext she finds in the video. 'I do everything by my own volition. I'm in charge, O.K.' Madonna in chains, though, is far removed from those unfortunate women who don't know that they have options."<ref name="nyt2"/> Madonna also complained about the feminist criticisms of her "crotch-grabbing", saying that "if male singers like [[Michael Jackson]] can get away with it, why can't women?"<ref>{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=50}}</ref> Theorist [[Douglas Kellner]] further asserted that the video was a feminist critique of male fighting and brutality, with images of the male workers engaged in a boxing match at the end.<ref name="kell"/> According to him, Madonna deliberately appropriated traditional feminine images in the beginning of the video, but contrasted them with her "crotch-hugging" male poses near the end, and discordant images of women assuming the male position.<ref name="kell"/> As feminist author [[Susan Bordo]] pointed out, "it is the postmodern nature of the video that has most entranced academic critics, and its various ways of constituting identities that refuse stability, that remain fluid, that resist definition."<ref>{{harvnb|Bordo|Heywood|2004|p=272}}</ref>

"Express Yourself" is also notable for its influence on numerous music artists. [[Spice Girls]] member [[Melanie C]] said "Madonna was doing the [[girl power]] thing a long time before the Spice Girls... 'Express Yourself' is one of the routines that I know and I used to really like doing that one because it is where she shows her bra and holds her crotch."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1421976.stm | title=Stars pay tribute to Madonna | date=2001-07-04|accessdate=2011-07-20|publisher=BBC (BBC Online)}}</ref> In 2010, singer [[Christina Aguilera]] paid tribute to "Express Yourself" with the music video of her single, "[[Not Myself Tonight]]". She commented "One of my favorite videos ever is 'Express Yourself' by Madonna which came across as really strong and empowering which I always try to incorporate through my expression of sexuality... I love the direct reference I made to Madonna with the eye glass moment and the smoke and stairs. I was paying tribute to a very strong woman who has paved the way before."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/aguilera-paid-tribute-to-madonna-in-new-promo_1143953 |title=Aguilera 'Paid Tribute' To Madonna In New Promo |publisher=[[Contactmusic.com]] |date= 2010-09-12|accessdate=2010-09-23}}</ref> James Montgomery from [[MTV]] deemed "Express Yourself" as the primary influence of Aguilera's video with scenes like Aguilera displaying a minocle, standing atop a flight of stairs and crawling across the floor while pouring a black liquid over herself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1638192/christina-aguileras-not-myself-tonight-video-popculture-cheat-sheet.jhtml|title=Christina Aguilera's 'Not Myself Tonight' Video: A Pop-Culture Cheat Sheet|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=2010-04-30|accessdate=2011-07-20|publisher=MTV (MTV Networks)}}</ref> Similarities were also noted between "Express Yourself" and singer [[Lady Gaga]]'s 2011 single "[[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]]" both in subject matter and composition.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/blogs/pop-life/lady-gagas-born-this-way-much-better-than-express-yourself-20110211 |title=Lady Gaga's 'Born This Way': Much Better Than 'Express Yourself' |date=2011-02-11|accessdate=2011-04-20|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner}}</ref> Gaga herself addressed the comparisons on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', explaining that she had received an [[e-mail]] from Madonna's representatives, who had mentioned their support for "Born This Way".<ref name="grammyandey">{{Cite news|last=Greenblatt|first=Leah|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/02/14/lady-gaga-madonna-leno-born-this-way/|title=Lady Gaga talks Grammy egg, Madonna comparisons on 'Leno' tonight |work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Inc| date=2011-02-14|accessdate=2011-02-15}}</ref> [[CNN]] later reported that Madonna's representatives were not aware that the singer, or her team, had sent Gaga an e-mail regarding the situation.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Stephanie|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/15/gaga.madonna.similar/index.html|title=Madonna & Gaga: Cut from the same leotard?|publisher=CNN|date=2011-02-17|accessdate=2011-02-17}}</ref> When accused of plagiarism by the media, Gaga addressed the comparisons to "Express Yourself" in an interview with ''[[NME]]'' by saying: "If you put the songs next to each other, side by side, the only similarities are the [[chord progression]].
