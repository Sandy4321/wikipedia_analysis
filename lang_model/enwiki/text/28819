'''Japanese<U+2013>Korean relations''' involve the nations of Korea and Japan, and in modern times three parties: [[Japan]], [[North Korea]], and [[South Korea]].  Japan and Korea have had cultural interactions for well over a thousand years and direct political contact almost as long.  In modern times Japan's relations with North Korea and South Korea has a legacy of bitterness stemming from [[Japan<U+2013>Korea disputes|unresolved disputes]] which occurred during [[Korea under Japanese rule|the Japanese Occupation of Korea]] from 1910 to 1945. 

In the early 2000s, the Japanese-South Korean relationship soured when the Japanese prime minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] visited the [[Yasukuni shrine]]. Conflict continues over claims for the [[Liancourt Rocks]], a small island half way between these 2 countries. Bilaterally and through the [[Six-Party Talks]], North Korea and Japan continue to discuss Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea during the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s South Korea has been in discussion with the Japanese to return the remains of Koreans who were abducted to Japan and used as slaves during the Japanese occupation from 1910 to 1945.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Korean Kingdoms-Japan==

Relations between Japan and Korea go back at least two millennia. [[Chinese culture]], including [[Chinese character|writing]] and religion, migrated from Korea to Japan in these early years. There are indications of cross border political influence, but with varying accounts as to which direction the political influence flowed. Some have said that Japan had early political footholds in southern Korea, and others indicating that early Japanese centers were populated with, if not partly controlled by Koreans. By the time of the Three Kingdoms period in Korea there were emissaries sent by Japan to the Korean kingdoms and vice versa.

In 1976 Japan stopped all foreign archeologists from studying the Gosashi tomb which is supposed to be the resting place of [[Empress Jing<U+016B>]]. Prior to 1976 foreigners did have access. In 2008, Japan allowed limited access to foreign archeologists, but the international community still has many unanswered questions. [[National Geographic]] wrote that Japan "has kept access to the tombs restricted, prompting rumors that officials fear excavation would reveal bloodline links between the "pure" [[imperial family]] and [[Korea]]."<ref>http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/04/080428-ancient-tomb.html</ref> These controversies make interpretation of the [[Nihongi]], [[Book of Song]]/Sui and [[Samguk Sagi]] inconclusive and until further analysis of restricted tombs and artifacts are evaluated, it is difficult to draw conclusions. "''Inariyama sword, as well as some other swords discovered in Japan, utilized the Korean <U+201C>Idu<U+201D> system of writing''" the swords "''originated in Paekche and that the kings named in their inscriptions represent Paekche kings rather than Japanese kings''"<ref>Hong, Wontack. (1994). Paekche of Korea and the Origin of Yamato Japan. Seoul: Kudara International</ref><ref>Jackson, Jr., Earl. (1997). Korea Writing System. 
http://www.anotherscene.com/japanpm/koreaw.html Consulted 2001 December 3</ref> How all these artifacts such be interpreted are still being questioned today.

In 1272 and 1281 [[Mongol invasions of Japan|combined Mongol-Korean fleets invaded Japan]], capturing slaves and slaughtering outlying villagers. These fleet actions were, in turn, devastated by ''[[Kamikaze (typhoon)|kamikaze]]'', a catastrophic typhoon that sank most of the invading fleet in both instances. These events led to the idea that Japan was divinely favored. It also set the stage for future retaliation against Korea by the Japanese.  

In the late 1500s there were a series of invasions by the armies of Japanese [[Shogun]]s into the unified Korean kingdom ([[Joseon dynasty|Chosun]]). Many Korean temples and buildings were burnt by the invading Japanese armies. Although Korean land forces lost most of their battles a decisive defeat of the Japanese fleet by the famous Korean Admiral [[Yi Sun-shin]] helped drive the Japanese out of Korea. After that time Korea remained firmly within the Chinese political sphere.

With the erosion of Chinese power in the 1800s Korea began to flex greater independence, partly in hopes of avoiding control by western powers, but also as a way to not come under Japanese control. Japan was rapidly modernizing in the second half of the nineteenth century and showing a keen interest in Korea. By the 1880s there were pro-Japanese and pro-Chinese factions influencing decisions by the Korean court. With the defeat of Chinese forces inside Korea in 1895 and the murder of [[Empress Myeongseong]], who was trying to modernize Korea by installing electric lights in the palaces in addition to trying to forge an alliance with Russia{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. With the defeat of Imperial Russia by Japan in 1905, Korea came firmly under the control of Japan. By 1910 the last threads of independence were removed and the Korean kingdom was [[Korea under Japanese rule|absorbed]] into the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese empire]]. From 1910 to 1945 there was a progression of efforts by the Japanese to erase Korean culture and language in the hopes of making all of Korea Japanese in nature.  Attempts to resist such as the peaceful 1919 uprisings (see [[March 1st Movement]]), were brutally put down. More than a million Koreans would end up living in Japan, and many of their [[Koreans in Japan|descendants]] live there to this day. Likewise, up to a million Japanese colonists moved to Korea.

It was not until the end of [[World War II]] and the defeat of Japan at the hands of Allied forces that Korea gained independence. Per the [[Yalta Conference]] agreements [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces accepted [[Surrender of Japan|surrender of Japanese forces]] in northern Korea, above the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]], and [[United States|American]] forces south of that line. Eventually [[Division of Korea|two states]] were created, one in the Soviet sphere (North Korea) and the other in the American sphere (South Korea).  At this same time all of the Japanese colonists in Korea were moved back to Japan. Of the Koreans who remained in Japan a significant number gave loyalty to the [[communist]] regime in North Korea, although that number has steadily eroded over time.

==Japan<U+2013>North Korea==
<!-- {{Foreign relations of North Korean}} should be placed here -->

Japan-North Korea relations turned more antagonistic in the late 1980s. The two governments did not maintain diplomatic relations and had no substantive contacts. The opposition [[Japan Socialist Party]], however, had cordial relations with the North Korean regime. Japan allowed trade with North Korea only through unofficial channels reportedly exceeding US$200 million annually in the 1980s.

Issues in Japan-North relations that produced tensions included North Korean media attacks on Japan, Japan's imposition of economic sanctions on North Korea for terrorist acts against South Korea in the 1980s, and unpaid North Korean debts to Japanese enterprises of about $50 million. 

Until the late 1980s, North Korea's post-World War II policy toward Japan was mainly aimed at minimizing cooperation between South Korea and Japan, and at deterring Japan's rearmament while striving for closer diplomatic and commercial ties with Japan. Crucial to this policy was the fostering within Japan of support for North Korea, especially among the Japanese who supported the Japanese communist and socialist parties and the Korean residents of Japan. 

Over the years, however, North Korea did much to discredit itself in the eyes of many potential supporters in Japan. Japanese who had accompanied their spouses to North Korea had endured severe hardships and were prevented from communicating with relatives and friends in Japan. Japan watched with disdain as North Korea gave safe haven to elements of the [[Japanese Red Army]], a terrorist group. North Korea's inability and refusal to pay its debts to Japanese traders also reinforced popular Japanese disdain for North Korea.

===Normalization talks===
In the early 1990s, Japan continued to conduct lengthy negotiations with North Korea aimed at establishing diplomatic relations with [[Pyongyang]] while maintaining its relations with Seoul. In January 1991, Japan began normalization talks with Pyongyang with a formal apology for its 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula. The negotiations were aided by Tokyo's support of a proposal for simultaneous entry to the [[United Nations]] by North Korea and South Korea; the issues of international inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities and the nature and amount of Japanese compensations, however, proved more difficult to negotiate.

Coincidental with the changing patterns in its relations with China and Russia, North Korea has moved to improve its strained relations with Japan. Pyongyang's primary motives appear to be a quest for relief from diplomatic and economic isolation, which has also caused serious shortages of food, energy, and hard currency. Normalization of relations with Japan also raises the possibility of North Korea's gaining monetary compensation for the period of Japan's colonial rule (1910-45), a precedent set when Japan normalized relations with South Korea.

The first round of normalization talks was held January 30- 31, 1991, but quickly broke down over the question of compensation. Pyongyang has demanded compensation for damages incurred during colonial rule as well as for "sufferings and losses" in the post-World War II period. Japan, however, insists that North Korea first resolve its differences with South Korea over the question of bilateral nuclear inspections. Other points of contention are North Korea's refusal both to provide information about [[Japanese people in North Korea|Japanese citizens who had migrated to North Korea]] with their Korean spouses in the 1960s, and the issue of [[Japanese people in Russia#Prisoners of war|Japanese soldiers taken prisoner by the Soviets]] during WWII and sent to North Korea.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mosnews.com/news/2005/04/01/japanesedied.shtml|date=2005-04-01|accessdate=2007-02-23|title=Russia Acknowledges Sending Japanese Prisoners of War to North Korea|publisher=Mosnews.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.jpri.org/publications/critiques/critique_IV_10.html|journal=Japan Policy Research Institute Critique|volume=4|number=10|date=November 1997|accessdate=2007-03-16|last=Kim|first=Yong Mok|title=The Dilemma of North Korea's Japanese Wives}}</ref>

===Abductions===
North Korea has refused to discuss the case of [[Yi Un Hee]], a Korean resident of Japan whom North Korean agents had [[North Korean abductions of Japanese|kidnapped to North Korea]] to teach Japanese in a school for espionage agents. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+kp0119) |title=North Korea; Japan|accessdate=2007-02-21 |last=Kim|first=Pan Suk |work=Library of Congress Country Studies |archivedate=}}</ref> For many years the North denied the abductions but admitted to 13 of them in 2002. In 2002 and 2004, Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] made two high-profile visits to Pyongyang to press for their return. North Korea eventually returned five of the thirteen kidnapped, claiming the other eight had died.<ref name="atimes2">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= Richard Hanson|coauthors= |title= The ashes of little Megumi|url= http://atimes.com/atimes/Japan/FK18Dh01.html|format= |work= |publisher= Asia Times Online|id= |pages= |page= |date= 2004-11-18|accessdate= 2007-01-19|language= English|quote= }}</ref><ref name="atimes3">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= Kosuke Takahashi|coauthors= |title= Koizumi: Risky mission half accomplished|url= http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/FE25Dh04.html|format= |work= |publisher= Asia Times Online|id= |pages= |page= |date= 2004-05-25|accessdate= 2007-01-19|language= English|quote= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= Tessa Morris-Suzuki|coauthors= |title= Exodus to North Korea|url=|format= |work= |publisher= Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|id= |page=17 |date= 2007|accessdate= 2007-05-21|language= English|quote= }}</ref> The positive effect on relations disintegrated when Japan claimed that a DNA test had proved that the returned remains of [[Megumi Yokota]], kidnapped at 13 and said by the North to have committed suicide, were in fact not hers.<ref name="Donga">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= Won-Jae Park|coauthors= |title= Clues Found in North Korean Kidnappings|url= http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?bicode=060000&biid=2006010741858|format= |work= |publisher= Donga|id= |pages= |page= |date= 2006-01-07|accessdate= 2007-01-19|language= English|quote= }}</ref> The negotiation on North Korea have been suspended because of a dispute over the North's kidnapping of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s, Yonhap quoted a Japanese newspaper as saying. Japan is pressing North Korea to come clean on the abduction but Pyongyang insists that the issue has already been resolved. 

Many North Korean citizens rely on money sent from relatives in Japan. Some in Japan believe that the government should threaten to cut off those remittances to force Pyongyang to make concessions. Others believe that the hard right in Japan is exploiting that and other issues to advance its own nationalist agenda.<ref name="atimes4">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= Victor Fic|coauthors= |title= Japanese right manipulates abduction issue|url= http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/FA15Dh03.html|format= |work= |publisher= Asia Times Online|id= |pages= |page= |date= 2004-01-15|accessdate= 2007-01-19|language= English|quote= }}</ref>

===Other activity===
There have also been several [[Action of 22 December 2001|Confrontations]] between the two nations over North Korean clandestine activity within Japan besides the abductions including drug smuggling, marine poaching, as well as spying. North Korean missile tests are also a concern for Japan because the missiles sometimes travel through Japanese airspace and territory.

===Six-party talks===
On February 13, 2007, the [[six-party talks]] produced an agreement in which North Korea agreed to shut down the [[Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center|Yongbyon nuclear facility]] in exchange for fuel aid and steps towards normalization of relations with both the United States and Japan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/zxxx/t297463.htm |title=Initial Actions for the Implementation of the Joint Statement |accessdate=2007-02-13 |date=2007-02-13 |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China]] website]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Rice hails N Korea nuclear deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6358797.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2007-02-13 |accessdate=2007-02-13 }}</ref>

===Recent bilateral talks===
The two states held bilateral talks in September 2007, which were resumed in June 2008.<ref>{{cite news |title= Japan and N Korea re-open talks |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7439190.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2007-06-07 |accessdate=2008-06-07 }}</ref>

==Japan<U+2013>South Korea==
[[Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan|Article 9]] of [[Constitution of Japan|Japan's constitution]] is interpreted to bar Japan from entering into security relations with countries other than the United States. Consequently, Japan had no substantive defense relationship with South Korea, and military contacts were infrequent. However, Japan backed United States contingency plans to dispatch United States armed forces in Japan to South Korea in case of a North Korean attack on South Korea. It also supported the opening of relations between South Korea and China in the 1980s. Since the [[Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea]], Japan has recognized South Korea as the only legitimate government of the whole Korean peninsula.

Since normalizing relations at the urging of the United States in 1965, [[Seoul]] and [[Tokyo]] have held annual foreign ministerial conferences. The usual issues discussed have been trade, the status of the [[Zainichi Korean|Korean minority population in Japan]], the content of [[Japanese history textbook controversies|textbooks dealing with the relationship]], Tokyo's equidistant policy between Pyongyang and Seoul, and the occasional problems.

[[Roh Tae-woo]]'s [[Nordpolitik]] somewhat relaxed Seoul's vehement opposition to Tokyo's approach to Pyongyang. The Japan Socialist Party, in particular, has become active in improving relations not only between Pyongyang and Tokyo, but also between itself and Seoul. As the [[Japan Socialist Party]] abandoned its posture favoring Pyongyang, Seoul has welcomed the new equidistant policy, inviting a former secretary general of the Japan Socialist Party, [[Masashi Ishibashi]], to Seoul in October 1988. Ishibashi's visit was unusually productive, not only in improving his party's image in Seoul, but also in his reported willingness to mediate between Seoul and Pyongyang. While Tokyo appeared willing to assist Seoul in improving relations not only with Pyongyang but also with Beijing, it did not seem to welcome the much-improved Seoul-Moscow relationship. Further, Seoul-Tokyo relations became somewhat strained when in 1989 Tokyo began steps to improve relations with Pyongyang.

Japan's trade with South Korea was US$29.1 billion in 1991, with a surplus of nearly US$5.8 billion on the Japanese side. Japanese direct private investment in South Korea totaled US$4.4 billion in 1990. Japanese and South Korean firms often had interdependent relations, which gave Japan advantages in South Korea's growing market. Many South Korean products were based on Japanese design and technology. A surge in imports of South Korean products into Japan in 1990 was partly the result of production by Japanese investors in South Korea.

In 1996 [[FIFA]] announced that the two countries would jointly host the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. The next few years would see leaders of both countries meet to warm relations in preparations for the games.<ref name="cnn">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title= South Korean leader bids farewell to Japanese emperor|url= http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9810/09/korea.japan.01/|format= |work= |publisher= CNN|id= |pages= 2|page= 1|date= 1998-10-09|accessdate= 2007-01-19|language= English|quote= }}</ref> Though citizens of both countries were initially unhappy about having to share the honors with the other, and the [[Liancourt Rocks]] controversy flared up again, it turned out to be very successful.

The year 2005 was designated as the "Japan-South Korea Friendship Year". However, the [[Liancourt Rocks]] controversy erupted again when Japan's [[Shimane prefecture]] declared "Takeshima Day", inciting mass demonstrations in South Korea. <ref name="bbc">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= Charles Scanlon|coauthors= |title= S Korean fury over island dispute|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4347851.stm|format= |work= |publisher= BBC|id= |pages= |page= |date= 2005-03-14|accessdate= 2007-01-19|language= English|quote= }}</ref>

===Cultural exchange===
====From South Korea to Japan====
In recent years, South Korean pop culture experienced major popularity in Japan, a phenomenon dubbed the {{nihongo|"[[Korean wave]]"|<U+97D3><U+6D41>}} in Japan. [[Winter Sonata]] was "the first of many hot Korean television dramas to hit Japan," according to the [[Washington Post]] in 2004.<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/30/AR2006083002985.html Japanese Women Catch the Korean Wave, Washington Post, August 31, 2006</ref> The female K-pop artist [[BoA]] is one of the most popular singers in Japan with six consecutive albums topping the billboard charts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} However, according to the [[Fuji Television]] and [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] have reported the Korean boom in Japan began declining in 2007. 82 percent of South Korea movies exported to Japan have recorded a deficit, which amounted to 9.5 billion [[Korean won|won]] in total.<ref>{{cite news | title=<U+D6C4><U+C9C0>TV <U+201C><U+D55C><U+AD6D> <U+C601><U+D654><U+C2DC><U+C7A5><U+C740> <U+BC84><U+BE14> <U+BD95><U+AD34> <U+C9C4><U+D589> <U+C911><U+201D> | author=<U+C8FC><U+BBF8><U+C625> | publisher=[[Seoul Shinmun]] | date=2007-11-20}}</ref>

====From Japan to South Korea====
After the end of [[WWII]], South Korea had banned [[Japanese culture|Japanese cultural]] products such as [[J-pop|music]], [[Cinema of Japan|film]], [[manga]] and [[Japanese literature|books]] for decades. In South Korea, the ban was partially lifted under the [[Kim Dae-jung]] administration in 1998. <ref>{{cite news | first=Yasushi | last=Azuma |title= Release of bilingual CD aims to soothe Tokyo-Seoul discord | url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20010501c3.html | publisher=[[Kyodo News]] ([[The Japan Times]]) |date= 2001-05-01|accessdate= 2007-01-19}}</ref><ref>http://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/area/korea/bunka/index.html</ref> As a result, translations and adaptations of Japanese cultural products such as [[J-pop|music]], [[manga]], [[anime]], [[video games]], [[Japanese television drama|TV dramas]] and novels, are seeing "explosive sales" in South Korea. <ref name="chosun3">{{cite news |title= Korea Can<U+2019>t Keep Siphoning Off Japanese Culture |url= http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200703/200703270031.html | publisher=[[The Chosun Ilbo]] |date= 2006-11-06|accessdate= 2007-01-19}}</ref>

The Japanese onslaught is evident in literature as well.
