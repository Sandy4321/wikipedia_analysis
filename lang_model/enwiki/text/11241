The '''Oregon Eastern Railway''' was a predecessor of the [[Southern Pacific Company]] that acquired or built most of the '''Natron Cutoff''' or '''Cascade Line''' in northern [[California]] and southern [[Oregon]], United States. It also made surveys and acquired [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] in eastern Oregon, which were subsequently sold to [[Union Pacific Railroad]] subsidiary [[Oregon<U+2013>Washington Railroad and Navigation Company]].

==History==
Starting in 1903, the [[Weed Lumber Company]] built a [[private railroad]] from the main line of the [[Southern Pacific Company]] (SP), formerly the [[California and Oregon Railroad]], in [[Weed, CA|Weed]] to [[Grass Lake, California]]. On July 6, 1905, the '''California Northeastern Railway''' was incorporated<!--in the interests of the lumber company or SP?--> to operate the line as a [[common carrier]]. The new company bought the line on July 29, and an SP-funded reconstruction was completed on September 1, 1906, when the line was opened to the public as a leased branch line of the SP.<ref name=Shasta/> Extensions were completed to [[Bray, California|Bray]] on September 6, 1907, [[Dorris, CA|Dorris]] on May 1, 1908, the Oregon state line<!--"Calor"--> on August 25, 1908, [[Worden, Oregon|Worden]] on November 25, 1908, [[Ady, Oregon|Ady]] on January 1, 1909, and finally the whole {{convert|86.15|mi}} to [[Klamath Falls, Oregon]] on May 20, 1909.<ref name=encyclopedia>Donald B. Robertson, Encyclopedia of Western Railroad History: Oregon, Washington, [[Caxton Printers]], 1986, p. 107</ref>

On August 21, 1905, the '''Oregon Eastern Railway''' was incorporated in the interest of the SP and [[Union Pacific Railroad]] (UP),<ref name=ICC-OWR&N>{{val rep|Oregon<U+2013>Washington Railroad & Navigation Company|329|44|V|1|year=1933|intlink=Oregon<U+2013>Washington Railroad and Navigation Company}}</ref> then both controlled by [[E. H. Harriman]]. This company surveyed a route from a line of SP lessor [[Oregon and California Railroad]] at [[Natron, Oregon|Natron]], near [[Springfield, OR|Springfield]], over the [[Cascades]] in the direction of the UP near [[Ontario, Oregon]]. It also planned to build branches south to [[Klamath Falls, OR|Klamath Falls]] and [[Lakeview, OR|Lakeview]], the former connecting with the California Northeastern. This company began construction in November 1909 on the line north from Klamath Falls, soon reaching [[Chiloquin, OR|Chiloquin]] under lease to the SP. The Oregon Eastern acquired the property of the California Northeastern on December 18, 1911, and on February 12, 1912, the property of the Oregon Eastern was sold to SP lessor [[Central Pacific Railway]], which owned the main line through Weed.<ref name=ICC-CP>{{val rep|Central Pacific Railway Company|1008|45|V|1|year=1933|intlink=Central Pacific Railway}}</ref> The Central Pacific completed two segments on which the Oregon Eastern had begun work: Natron to [[Oakridge, OR|Oakridge]] and Chiloquin to [[Kirk, Oregon|Kirk]], in May and September 1912 respectively.<ref name=encyclopedia/> However, work was then placed on hold while the federal government decided whether the SP's lease of the CP violated the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. (It had already broken up the SP-UP combination in 1913.) The [[Transportation Act of 1920]] gave the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] the power to approve combinations that would serve the public interest, and on February 10, 1923, the ICC approved the SP's continued control of the Central Pacific, which was backed by the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] on June 11.<ref name=Shasta>John R. Signor, Rails in the shadow of Mt. Shasta, [[Howell-North Books]], 1982, pp. 98-100, 110, 121</ref> Construction resumed in October, and on September 1, 1926 the Natron Cutoff was completed.<ref name=encyclopedia/> Finally, On April 17, 1927, a new line opened between [[Black Butte (Siskiyou County, California)|Black Butte]] (south of Weed) and Grass Lake, replacing the cheaply built former logging line, and allowing the SP to inaugurate the all-[[Pullman (car or coach)|Pullman]] ''[[Cascade (passenger train)|Cascade]]'' between [[San Francisco, CA|San Francisco]] and [[Portland, OR|Portland]] over this route.<ref name=Shasta/><ref>Guy L. Dunscomb, A Century of Southern Pacific Steam Locomotives, 1862-1962, 1963, pp. 395, 467</ref>

As for the line into eastern Oregon, the Oregon Eastern sold its surveys and right-of-way to new UP subsidiary [[Oregon<U+2013>Washington Railroad and Navigation Company]] (OWR&N) on December 23, 1910. Some of this property was acquired<!--ICC says on December 28, 1910?!--> from the '''Boise and Western Railway''', which had been incorporated on September 13, 1909 in the interest of [[Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway]] subsidiary [[Oregon Trunk Railway]] to build in the same area.<ref>John T. Gaertner, North Bank Road: the Spokane, Portland & Seattle Railway, [[Washington State University Press]], 1991, p. 103</ref> The OWR&N subsequently built the [[Ontario<U+2013>Burns Branch]] on this alignment, branching from the former [[Malheur Valley Railway]] at [[Vale, OR|Vale]] and eventually reaching [[Burns, OR|Burns]], which it leased to UP subsidiary [[Oregon Short Line Railroad]] for operation.<ref name=ICC-OWR&N/>

All of the Cascade Line remains in service as part of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]'s [[I-5 Corridor (Union Pacific Railroad)|I-5 Corridor]], also served by [[Amtrak]]'s ''[[Coast Starlight]]''. The Ontario<U+2013>Burns Branch in eastern Oregon was sold on November 6, 1989 to [[shortline (railroad)|shortline]] [[Wyoming Colorado Railroad]], but abandoned east of [[Celatom, Oregon|Celatom]] in June 1992.<ref>[[Union Pacific Railroad]], [http://www.uprr.com/customers/shortline/lines/wc.shtml Short Line Railroad Directory: Wyoming Colorado Railroad Company, Inc.
