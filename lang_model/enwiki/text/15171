'''State Trunk Highway 16''' (often called '''Highway 16''', '''STH 16''' or '''WIS 16''') is a [[Wisconsin]] state [[highway]] running from [[Pewaukee, Wisconsin|Pewaukee]] across the state to [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]]. Much of its route in the state parallels the former mainline of the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]] (Milwaukee Road).  

Formerly [[U.S. Highway 16]], most of the highway was bypassed by [[Interstate 90 (Wisconsin)|Interstate 90]] and [[Interstate 94 (Wisconsin)|Interstate 94]] in the 1960s and 1970s. Highway 16 is 193.2 miles in length, including the new [[Oconomowoc, Wisconsin|Oconomowoc]] Bypass section. Highway 16 is routed with several other US, state and county highways over a majority of its length. 

==Termini==
The eastern end of the route is a limited-access freeway from [[Oconomowoc, Wisconsin|Oconomowoc]] to its terminus at [[Interstate 94 (Wisconsin)|Interstate 94]], near the [[Waukesha County]] Airport (also known as Crites Field). The first sign for Highway 16 West is on the long curve of the on-ramp from I-94. 

The western terminus of the highway is at the Wisconsin-Minnesota border along the route of [[U.S. Highway 14 (Wisconsin)|U.S. Highway 14]] and [[U.S. Highway 61 (Wisconsin)|U.S. Highway 61]], just west of [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]]. [[Minnesota State Highway 16]] continues to the west from this point. The first sign for Highway 16 east in Wisconsin is on Pettibone Island, on the approach to the [[Cameron Avenue Bridge]] just outside of downtown [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]].

==The Oconomowoc Bypass==
{{Commonscat|Wisconsin Highway 16}}
The alignment of the eastern section of Highway 16 changed in late 2006 when the rest of the [[Oconomowoc, Wisconsin|Oconomowoc]] bypass was opened to traffic. The four-lane, limited access divided highway routes Highway 16 around Lac La Belle on the west side of the city, meeting up with [[Highway 67 (Wisconsin)|Highway 67]] north of downtown. Eventually, the bypass will result in the removal of the state highway designation from Wisconsin Avenue through downtown [[Oconomowoc, Wisconsin|Oconomowoc]]. 

The signs for Highway 16 through downtown [[Oconomowoc, Wisconsin|Oconomowoc]] have not yet been changed, but will likely be taken down and replaced with a Business designation by the end of 2007. Currently, the limited-access highway around Oconomowoc is designated as BYPASS 16 on signage.List Source<ref name="dot2">{{cite web | author = Wisconsin Department of Transportation | authorlink = Wisconsin Department of Transportation | title =Oconomowoc Bypass Project page | url =http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/projects/d2/ocon/index.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-30}}</ref>
