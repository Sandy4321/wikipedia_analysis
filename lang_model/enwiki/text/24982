'''Hiroshi Izumi''' ({{lang|ja|<U+6CC9><U+6D69>}} born June 22, 1982 in [[Shimokita District, Aomori|Shimokita District]] [[Aomori Prefecture|Aomori]]) is a Japanese [[judoka]] and [[mixed martial arts|mixed martial artist]]. He has fought in [[World Victory Road]] and had a one-fight stint in the [[Dream (mixed martial arts)|Dream]] promotion for the [[List of Dream champions|Dream Light Heavyweight Championship]]. Izumi also appeared in both [[Dynamite!! 2009]] and [[Dynamite!! 2010]] New Year's Eve events.

==Background==
Izumi, was born in [[Aomori, Japan]] and comes from a fishing family in the [[Shimokita Peninsula]]. His father, who can often be seen spectating his son's [[judo]] and [[mixed martial arts|MMA]] matches, still fishes for [[bluefin tuna]] at over 70 years of age. Izumi began judo at a young age and is known as a very accomplished [[judoka]], winning the men's -90&nbsp;kg category silver medal at the [[2004 Summer Olympic|Athens Olympics]] in 2004 and the gold medal at the [[2005 World Judo Championships|World Judo Championship Games]] in [[Cairo, Egypt]] on 2005.

==Mixed Martial Arts==
Izumi made his mixed martial arts debut against New Zealand [[kickboxing]] specialist, [[Antz Nansen]] for Japan's [[Sengoku Raiden Championships|Sengoku]] promotion in September 2009 after Izumi signed with [[World Victory Road]]. Instead of using his [[judo]] techniques to his advantage during his debut, Izumi attempted to trade punches with the world-class striker. Izumi was beaten badly in his debut and lost the fight by [[technical knockout|TKO]].

After his poor performance in his debut, Izumi began turning his mixed martial arts career around. At [[Dynamite!! 2009]], representing [[Sengoku Raiden Championships|Sengoku]], he won via unanimous decision over [[Katsuyori Shibata]]. After being dominated through the first few rounds, Izumi came back in the second half of the very final round, landing a great sequence of punches and controlling Shibata on the ground, where he utilized many hammerfists. This win was very significant because Izumi's father was vocal in saying that if Izumi was defeated again, that he would take his son out of [[mixed martial arts|MMA]] and return to judo.

Izumi followed this win up with 3 more wins, including one at [[Dynamite!! 2010]], against former [[Pride Fighting Championships|PRIDE]] veteran and [[List of Dream champions|Dream Super Hulk Tournament Champion]] [[Ikuhisa Minowa]] by [[Technical knockout|TKO]]. This is perhaps the biggest win of Izumi's career to date.

Izumi then earned a title shot at [[Gegard Mousasi]] for the [[List of Dream champions|Dream Light Heavyweight Championship]], but lost by [[Technical knockout|TKO]].
