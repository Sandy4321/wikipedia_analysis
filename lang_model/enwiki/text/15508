Upon returning to [[Family Guy#Setting|Quahog]], Peter takes him to a [[strip club]] to simulate a bachelor party. In his excitement, Carter develops a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and falls into a [[coma]]. [[Gregory House|Dr. House]] is hired to treat him, but he throws his rule book out the window and punches Carter in the face to ensure that he is comatose. Carter's video [[will (law)|will]] is discovered, in which he gives Lois control of his billion dollar [[manufacturing company]], Pewterschmidt Industries, even though she does not know how to run a [[corporation]].
