The series follows the adventures and endeavors of [[spongeBob SquarePants (character)|the title character]] and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, [[Mr. Krabs]] reveals to [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] that he and his business rival [[Plankton (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Plankton]] were actually [[best friend (friendship)|best friends]] during their childhood. Through a series of [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], Mr. Krabs tells the story of how that friendship deteriorated, the cause of their rivalry, and how the Krabby Patty sandwich was created in the process. The episode became available on DVD on April 17, 2007. "Friend or Foe" received positive reviews upon release.

==Plot summary==
After yet another attack at the [[Krusty Krab]] by [[Plankton (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Plankton]], [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] asks [[Mr. Krabs]] why they hate each other. Mr. Krabs tells his side of the story, in a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]]. In the flashback, Mr. Krabs and Plankton were best friends from birth, and did everything together. One day, they get enough money to buy a burger from Stinky's Burgers, which, despite having horrible food and being located in a [[landfill]], is very popular among the local children due to being the only place in town to get a burger. Plankton and Krabs decide to go into the burger business themselves, and create their own burger, but no one wants to try it. When Stinky's is closed by the local health department, the two open "Plabs Burgers" on his former site, which the children are now forced to eat at, despite it being even worse than Stinky's. Plankton says that they are now ruling the children. Mr. Krabs argues that it should be about satisfying the customers, rather than power. Soon they get into an argument, and Krabs is ejected into a dump pile and tells Plankton that he will one day regret this.

Back to the Krusty Krab, Plankton comes in and disagrees with Mr. Krabs' story and tells SpongeBob his own version. His story is the same as Mr. Krabs', except that their roles during the fight at the end are reversed, with Krabs wanting to rule the money of the children and when they disagreed shot Plankton out of a straw into the dump. Plankton and Krabs begin arguing about the story, until [[Plankton (SpongeBob SquarePants)#Karen|Karen]] arrives and tells the real story. In the story, the restaurant initially has no customers, and Old Man Jenkins, an elderly resident and an old friend of Krab's family, is the first to try their burger, but collapses, having been poisoned by the patty. Krabs and Plankton become angry and accuse each other of tainting the patty. They begin fighting over the recipe, eventually tearing it in two. Their friendship over, Plankton storms out to pursue his own career in food. However, during the struggle, a shelf was knocked down, dumping various ingredients into the patty batter, creating the Krabby Patty recipe, which Krabs is left with. The two go their separate ways, each trying to open their own establishment. Mr. Krabs' "Krabby Patty" became a success, while Plankton's Chum Burger is horrible.

After hearing the story, Plankton and Krabs begin to make up, until Plankton and Karen take the formula from his pocket. SpongeBob and Krabs start chasing after them, and the episode ends with them running around in front of the Krusty Krab.

==Reception==
"Friend or Foe" received mostly positive reviews. Paul Mavis of [[DVD Talk]] was positive towards the episode specifically on the [[live action]] scenes, writing "Patchy and Potty are always funny, so it's great to see them slinging hamburgers in honor of their idol, SpongeBob. I particularly liked the gorilla at the end, whipping burgers at Patchy ('You got me right in the buns!')."<ref name=Mavis>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/27528/spongebob-squarepants-friend-or-foe/|title=Spongebob Squarepants - Friend Or Foe?|publisher=DVD Talk|accessdate=September 14, 2013|date=April 13, 2007|author=Mavis, Paul}}</ref> Mavis also praised the episode calling it "brilliant" because "[Mr.] Krabs and Plankton are strong enough characters, with their own mythology, that they can sustain their very own episode with only a cameo from SpongeBob."<ref name=Mavis/> He also said the episode is "[...]hilarious (I love the fact that it's a barely disguised version of ''[[Rashomon]]''), with an especially funny look at Krabs, Plankton, and even SpongeBob, as babies."<ref name=Mavis/>

David Packard of [[DVD Verdict]] said that the live action scenes "add to the silliness."<ref name=Packard>{{cite web|title=Spongebob Squarepants: Friend Or Foe?|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/spongebobfriendorfoe.php|publisher=DVD Verdict|accessdate=May 4, 2013|date=August 29, 2007|author=Packard, David}}</ref> He also said "It's a nice change of pace to see Plankton and Krabs as chums pre-Chum Bucket and finding out what led to their friendship's eventual demise. Viewers also get to see Mr. Krabs introduced to 'the love of his life' as he develops the secret formula to the Krabby Patty that Bikini Bottom's residents know and love today."<ref name=Packard/> On the DVD, Patrick Cossel of [[Blogcritics]] said "Children and adults will laugh out loud at the crazy slapstick antics of the one who lives under the sea." He added that "This release is sure to be huge hit for Spongebob fans everywhere."<ref>{{cite web|last=Cossel|first=Patrick|title=DVD Review: Spongebob Squarepants Friend or Foe|url=http://blogcritics.org/video/article/dvd-review-spongebob-squarepants-friend-or/|publisher=Blogcritics|accessdate=May 4, 2013|date=April 16, 2007}}</ref> Lesley Aeschliman of [[Yahoo!
