'''Hypertension (HTN)''' or '''high blood pressure''' is a [[cardiac]] [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[Disease|medical condition]] in which the systemic arterial [[blood pressure]] is elevated. It is the opposite of [[hypotension]]. Hypertension is classified as either primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension; About 90<U+2013>95% of cases are categorized as "primary hypertension," which means high blood pressure with no obvious medical cause.<ref name="pmid10645931">{{cite journal |author=Carretero OA, Oparil S |title=Essential hypertension.

Blood pressure is usually classified based on the systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Systolic blood pressure is the blood pressure in vessels during a heart beat. Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure between heartbeats. A systolic or the diastolic blood pressure measurement higher than the accepted normal values for the age of the individual is classified as prehypertension or hypertension.

Hypertension<ref name="High blood pressure">{{cite web | title = High blood pressure - NHS | url = http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Blood-pressure-(high)/Pages/Introduction.aspx | publisher = [[National Health Service (NHS)]]}}</ref> has several sub-classifications including, hypertension stage I, hypertension stage II, and isolated systolic hypertension. Isolated systolic hypertension refers to elevated systolic pressure with normal diastolic pressure and is common in the elderly. These classifications are made after averaging a patient's resting blood pressure readings taken on two or more office visits. Individuals older than 50 years are classified as having hypertension if their blood pressure is consistently at least 140&nbsp;mmHg systolic or 90&nbsp;mmHg diastolic. Patients with blood pressures higher than 130/80&nbsp;mmHg with concomitant presence of [[diabetes mellitus]] or [[kidney disease]] require further treatment.<ref name="jnc7"/>

Hypertension is also classified as resistant if [[Pharmaceutical drug|medications]] do not reduce blood pressure to normal levels.<ref name="jnc7"/>

Mild to moderate essential hypertension is usually [[asymptomatic]].<ref name="pmid9472183">{{cite journal |author=Pitts SR, Adams RP |title=Emergency department hypertension and regression to the mean |journal=[[Annals of Emergency Medicine]] |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=214<U+2013>8 |year=1998 |month=February |pmid=9472183 |doi= 10.1016/S0196-0644(98)70309-9|url= |issn= |accessdate=2009-06-18}}</ref>

===Accelerated hypertension===
Accelerated hypertension is associated with [[headache]], [[somnolence|drowsiness]], [[confusion]], [[vision disorder]]s, [[nausea]], and [[vomiting]]. These symptoms are collectively called [[hypertensive encephalopathy]].<ref name="Oppenheimer and Fishberg 1928">Oppenheimer, B S, and Fishberg, A M, Archives of Internal Medicine, 1928, 41, 264.</ref> Hypertensive encephalopathy is caused by severe [[capillary|small blood vessel]] congestion and [[cerebral edema|brain swelling]], which is reversible if blood pressure is lowered.<ref name="isbn0-07-159124-9">{{cite book |author=Papadakis, Maxine A.; McPhee, Stephen J. |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment 2009 (Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment) |edition= |language= |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location= |year=2008 |origyear= |pages= |quote= |isbn=0-07-159124-9 |oclc= }}</ref>

===Secondary hypertension===
{{Main|Secondary hypertension}}
Some additional signs and symptoms suggest that the hypertension is caused by disorders in hormone regulation. Hypertension combined with [[centripetal obesity|obesity distributed on the trunk of the body]], accumulated fat on the back of the neck ('[[lipodystrophy|buffalo hump]]'), wide purple marks on the abdomen ([[abdominal striae]]), or the recent onset of diabetes suggests that an individual has a hormone disorder known as [[Cushing's syndrome]]. Hypertension caused by other [[endocrine disease|hormone disorders]] such as [[hyperthyroidism]], [[hypothyroidism]], or [[growth hormone excess]] will be accompanied by additional symptoms specific to these disorders. For example, hyperthyrodism can cause [[weight loss]], [[tremors]], [[tachycardia|heart rate abnormalities]], [[palmar erythema|reddening of the palms]], and increased [[sweating]].<ref name="urlHyperthyroidism: eMedicine Endocrinology">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/121865-overview |title=Hyperthyroidism |author=Lee, Stephanie L |authorlink= |coauthors=Ananthakrishnan, Sonia |date=April 26, 2010 |work=eMedicine Endocrinology |publisher=Medscape |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> Signs and symptoms associated with [[growth hormone excess]] include coarsening of facial features, [[prognathism|protrusion of the lower jaw]], [[macroglossia|enlargement of the tongue]],<ref name="urlAcromegaly: eMedicine Endocrinology">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/116366-overview |title=Acromegaly |author=Khandwala, Hasnain M |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=February 13, 2009 |work=eMedicine Endocrinology |publisher=Medscape |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> [[hypertrichosis|excessive hair growth]], [[hyperpigmentation|darkening of the skin color]], and [[hyperhidrosis|excessive sweating]].<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk |year=2005 |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin:no Clinical Dermatology |edition=10th |publisher=Saunders |isbn=0721629210}}</ref>{{Rp|499|date=May 2009}}.

===In pregnancy===
Hypertension in pregnant women is one symptom of [[pre-eclampsia]]. Pre-eclampsia can progress to a life-threatening condition called [[eclampsia]], which is the development of [[proteinuria|protein in the urine]], [[edema|generalized swelling]], and severe [[tonic-clonic seizures|seizures]]. Other symptoms indicating that brain function is becoming impaired may precede these seizures such as nausea, vomiting, headaches, and [[blindness|vision loss]].<ref name="urlHypertension and Pregnancy: eMedicine Obstetrics and Gynecology">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/261435-overview |title=Hypertension and Pregnancy |author=Gibson, Paul |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=July 30, 2009 |work=eMedicine Obstetrics and Gynecology |publisher=Medscape |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref>

In addition, the systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure decrease during pregnancy. The body must compensate by increasing cardiac output and blood volume to provide sufficient circulation in the utero-placental arterial bed.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20954460</ref>

===In children===
Some signs and symptoms are especially important in [[neonates|newborns]] and [[infants]] such as [[failure to thrive]], [[seizures]], [[irritability]], [[lethargy|lack of energy]], and [[respiratory distress|difficulty breathing]].<ref name="urlHypertension: eMedicine Pediatrics: Cardiac Disease and Critical Care Medicine">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/889877-overview |title=Hypertension |author=Rodriguez-Cruz, Edwin |authorlink= |coauthors=Ettinger, Leigh M |date=April 6, 2010 |work=eMedicine Pediatrics: Cardiac Disease and Critical Care Medicine |publisher=Medscape |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> In children, hypertension can cause headache, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[blurred vision]], [[epistaxis|nosebleeds]], and [[bell palsy|facial paralysis]].<ref name="urlHypertension: eMedicine Pediatrics: Cardiac Disease and Critical Care Medicine"/>

Even with the above clinical symptoms, the true incidence of pediatric hypertension is not known. In adults, hypertension has been defined due to the adverse effects caused by hypertension. However, in children, similar studies have not been performed thoroughly to link any adverse effects with the increase in blood pressure. Therefore, the prevalence of pediatric hypertension remains unknown due to the lack of scientific knowledge.<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/889877-overview</ref>

===Secondary hypertension===
{{Main|Secondary hypertension}}
Secondary hypertension by definition results from an identifiable cause. This type is important to recognize since it's treated differently to essential hypertension, by treating the underlying cause of the elevated blood pressure. Hypertension results in the compromise or imbalance of the pathophysiological mechanisms, such as the hormone-regulating [[endocrine]] system, that regulate blood plasma volume and heart function. Many conditions cause hypertension. Some are common, well-recognized secondary causes such as [[Cushing's syndrome]],<ref name="pmid19096817">{{cite journal |author=Dodt C, Wellh<U+00F6>ner JP, Sch<U+00FC>tt M, Sayk F |title=[Glucocorticoids and hypertension] |language=German |journal=[[Der Internist]] |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=36<U+2013>41 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19096817 |doi=10.1007/s00108-008-2197-6 |issn= |accessdate=2009-06-18}}</ref> which is a condition where the [[adrenal gland]]s overproduce the hormone [[cortisol]].<ref name="pmid19096817"/> Hypertension is also caused by other conditions that cause hormone changes, such as hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism (citation needed), and certain tumors of the adrenal medulla (e.g., [[pheochromocytoma]]). Other common causes of secondary hypertension include kidney disease, obesity/[[metabolic disorder]], [[pre-eclampsia]] during pregnancy, the congenital defect known as [[coarctation of the aorta]], and certain prescription and illegal drugs.

==Pathophysiology==
{{Main|Pathophysiology of hypertension}}
[[Image:Arterial pressure diagram.png|thumb|right|350px|A diagram explaining factors affecting [[arterial pressure]]]]
Most of the mechanisms associated with secondary hypertension are generally fully understood. However, those associated with [[essential (primary) hypertension]] are far less understood. What is known is that [[cardiac output]] is raised early in the disease course, with [[total peripheral resistance]] (TPR) normal; over time cardiac output drops to normal levels but TPR is increased. Three theories have been proposed to explain this:
* Inability of the kidneys to excrete sodium, resulting in [[natriuretic]] factors such as [[Atrial Natriuretic Factor]] being secreted to promote salt excretion with the [[side effect]] of raising total peripheral resistance.
* An overactive [[Renin-angiotensin system]] leads to [[vasoconstriction]] and retention of sodium and water. The increase in [[blood volume]] plus vasoconstriction leads to hypertension.<ref name="pmid19475781">{{cite journal |author=Pimenta E, Oparil S |title=Role of aliskiren in cardio-renal protection and use in hypertensives with multiple risk factors |journal=[[Vascular Health and Risk Management]] |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=453<U+2013>63 |year=2009 |pmid=19475781 |pmc=2686262 |doi= |url= |issn= |accessdate=2009-06-30}}</ref>

It is also known that hypertension is highly heritable and [[polygenic]] (caused by more than one gene) and a few candidate [[genes]] have been postulated in the etiology of this condition.<ref name="polymorphism">{{cite journal |author= Sagnella GA, Swift PA |journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design |title=The Renal Epithelial Sodium Channel: Genetic Heterogeneity and Implications for the Treatment of High Blood Pressure |year = 2006 |month = June |volume = 12 |issue = 14 |pages = 2221<U+2013>2234 |pmid = 16787251 | doi = 10.2174/138161206777585157}}</ref>

Recently, work related to the association between essential hypertension and sustained endothelial damage has gained popularity among hypertension scientists. It remains unclear however whether endothelial changes precede the development of hypertension or whether such changes are mainly due to long standing elevated blood pressures.

==Diagnosis==
Hypertension is generally diagnosed on the basis of a persistently high blood pressure. Usually this requires three separate sphygmomanometer (see figure) measurements at least one week apart. Often, this entails three separate visits to the physician's office. Initial assessment of the hypertensive patient should include a complete [[Medical history|history]] and [[physical examination]]. Exceptionally, if the elevation is extreme, or if symptoms of organ damage are present then the diagnosis may be given and treatment started immediately.

Once the diagnosis of hypertension has been made, physicians will attempt to identify the underlying cause based on risk factors and other symptoms, if present. [[Secondary hypertension]] is more common in preadolescent children, with most cases caused by [[renal disease]]. Primary or [[essential hypertension]] is more common in adolescents and has multiple risk factors, including obesity and a family history of hypertension.<ref name="pmid16719248">{{cite journal | author = Luma GB, Spiotta RT | title = Hypertension in children and adolescents | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 73 | issue = 9 | pages = 1558<U+2013>68 | month = may | year = 2006 | pmid = 16719248}}</ref> Laboratory tests can also be performed to identify possible causes of secondary hypertension, and determine if hypertension has caused damage to the [[Human heart|heart]], [[Human eyes|eyes]], and [[kidney]]s. Additional tests for Diabetes and high [[cholesterol]] levels are also usually performed because they are additional risk factors for the development of [[heart disease]] require treatment.<ref name="pmid10645931"/> Tests typically performed are classified as follows:

[[Creatinine]] ([[renal function]]) testing is done to determine if kidney disease is present, which can be either the cause or result of hypertension. In addition, it provides a baseline measurement of kidney function that can be used to monitor for side-effects of certain antihypertensive drugs on kidney function. Additionally, testing of urine samples for [[proteinuria|protein]] is used as a secondary indicator of kidney disease. [[Glucose]] testing is done to determine if diabetes mellitus is present. [[Electrocardiogram]] (EKG/ECG) testing is done to check for evidence of the heart being under strain from high blood pressure. It may also show if there is thickening of the heart muscle ([[left ventricular hypertrophy]]) or has experienced a prior minor heart disturbance such as a silent heart attack. A [[chest X-ray]] may be performed to look for signs of heart enlargement or damage to heart tissue.

==Prevention==
The degree to which hypertension can be prevented depends on a number of features including current blood pressure level, sodium/potassium balance, detection and omission of environmental toxins, changes in end/target organs ([[retina]], [[kidney]], heart, among others), risk factors for [[cardiovascular diseases]] and the age at diagnosis of prehypertension or at risk for hypertension. A prolonged assessment that involves repeated blood pressure measurements provides the most accurate blood pressure level assessment. Following this, lifestyle changes are recommended to lower blood pressure, before the initiation of prescription drug therapy. The process of managing prehypertension according the guidelines of the [[British Hypertension Society]] suggest the following lifestyle changes:

* [[weight loss|Weight reduction]] and regular [[aerobic exercise]] (e.g., [[walking]]): Regular exercise improves [[blood flow]] and helps to reduce the resting heart rate and blood pressure.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Elley CR, Arroll B |title=Review: aerobic exercise reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adults |journal=ACP J.

* Reduce dietary sugar
* Reduce [[sodium chloride|sodium (salt)]] in the body by disuse of condiment sodium and the adoption of a high [[potassium]] diet which rids the [[renal]] system of excess sodium. Many people use [[potassium chloride]]<ref>Journal of Hypertension: May 1991 - Volume 9 - Issue 5 > Does potassium supplementation lower blood pressure? A meta-...</ref>[[salt substitute]] to reduce their salt intake.<ref name="pmid19418415">{{cite journal |author=Klaus D, B<U+00F6>hm M, Halle M, ''et al.'' |title=[Restriction of salt intake in the whole population promises great long-term benefits] |language=German |journal=[[Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift (1946)]] |volume=134 Suppl 3 |issue= |pages=S108<U+2013>18 |year=2009 |month=May |pmid=19418415 |doi=10.1055/s-0029-1222573 }}</ref>
* Additional dietary changes beneficial to reducing blood pressure include the [[DASH diet]] ('''d'''ietary '''a'''pproaches to '''s'''top '''h'''ypertension) which is rich in fruits and vegetables and low-fat or fat-free dairy products.

* Discontinuing [[tobacco use]] and [[alcohol consumption]] has been shown to lower blood pressure. The exact mechanisms are not fully understood, but blood pressure (especially systolic) always transiently increases following alcohol or nicotine consumption. Abstaining from [[Tobacco smoking|cigarette smoking]] reduces the risks of stroke and heart attack associated with hypertension.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Groppeli A, Giorgi DM, Omboni S, Parati G, Mancia G. | title= Persistent blood pressure increase induced by heavy smoking | journal= Journal of Human Hypertension | volume= 10 | issue= 5 | year = 1992}}</ref>

==Treatment==
===Lifestyle modifications===

Drug prescription should take into account the patient's absolute cardiovascular risk (including risk of myocardial infarction and stroke) as well as blood pressure readings, in order to gain a more accurate picture of the patient's cardiovascular profile.<ref name=nps01 /> Different programs aimed to reduce psychological stress such as [[biofeedback]], [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]] or [[meditation]] are advertised to reduce hypertension. However, in general claims of efficacy are not supported by scientific studies, which have been in general of low quality.<ref name="pmid19822104">{{cite journal |author=Greenhalgh J, Dickson R, Dundar Y |title=The effects of biofeedback for the treatment of essential hypertension: a systematic review |journal=Health Technol Assess |volume=13 |issue=46 |pages=1<U+2013>104 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19822104 |doi=10.3310/hta13460 |url= |doi_brokendate=2010-08-21}}</ref><ref name="pmid18350109">{{cite journal |author=Rainforth MV, Schneider RH, Nidich SI, Gaylord-King C, Salerno JW, Anderson JW |title=Stress reduction programs in patients with elevated blood pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Curr.

Regarding dietary changes, a [[low sodium diet]] is beneficial; A [[Cochrane review]] published in 2008 concluded that a long term (more than 4 weeks) low sodium diet in [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] has a useful effect to reduce blood pressure, both in people with hypertension and in people with normal blood pressure.<ref name=cochrane2008>He FJ, MacGregor GA.

Art. No.: CD004937. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004937.</ref> Also, the [[DASH diet]] (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) is a [[dieting|diet]] promoted by the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]] (part of the [[NIH]], a United States government organization) to control hypertension. A major feature of the plan is limiting intake of [[sodium]],<ref name="dashguide">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/hbp/dash/new_dash.pdf|title=Your Guide To Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref> and it also generally encourages the consumption of nuts, whole grains, fish, poultry, fruits and vegetables while lowering the consumption of red meats, sweets, and sugar. It is also "rich in [[potassium]], [[magnesium]], and [[calcium]], as well as [[protein]]".

===Medications===
Several classes of medications, collectively referred to as [[antihypertensive drug]]s, are currently available for treating hypertension. Reduction of the [[blood pressure]] by 5&nbsp;mmHg can decrease the risk of stroke by 34%, of [[ischaemic heart disease]] by 21%, and reduce the likelihood of [[dementia]], [[heart failure]], and [[death|mortality]] from [[cardiovascular disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Law M, Wald N, Morris J |title=Lowering blood pressure to prevent myocardial infarction and stroke: a new preventive strategy |journal=Health Technol Assess |volume=7 |issue=31 |pages=1<U+2013>94 |year=2003 |pmid=14604498 |url=http://www.hta.ac.uk/fullmono/mon731.pdf}}</ref> The aim of treatment should be to reduce blood pressure to <140/90&nbsp;mmHg for most individuals, and lower for individuals with diabetes or kidney disease (some medical professionals recommend keeping levels below 120/80&nbsp;mmHg).<ref>{{cite web|first=Gina |last=Shaw |url=http://www.webmd.com/content/article/73/88927.htm |title=Prehypertension: Early-stage High Blood Pressure |publisher=WebMD |date=2009-03-07 |accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref> If the blood pressure goal is not met, a change in treatment should be made as [[therapeutic inertia]] is a clear impediment to blood pressure control.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1161/01.HYP.0000200702.76436.4b|url=http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/47/3/345|title=Therapeutic Inertia Is an Impediment to Achieving the Healthy People 2010 Blood Pressure Control Goals|author=Eni C.

The first line antihypertensive supported by the best evidence is a low dose [[Thiazide|thiazide-based diuretic]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wright JM, Musini VM |title=First-line drugs for hypertension |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD001841 |year=2009 |pmid=19588327 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001841.pub2 |url=}}</ref>

Often multiple medications are needed to be combined to achieve the goal blood pressure. Commonly used prescription drugs include:<ref name="NICE-BP"/>[[ACE inhibitor]]s, [[alpha blocker]]s, [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]]s , [[beta blocker]]s , [[calcium channel blocker]]s, diuretics (e.g. [[hydrochlorothiazide]]), direct [[renin inhibitor]]s.

Some examples of common combined prescription drug treatments include:
*A fixed combination of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker. One example of this is the combination of [[perindopril]] and [[amlodipine]], the efficacy of which has been demonstrated in individuals with [[impaired glucose tolerance|glucose intolerance]] or [[metabolic syndrome]].<ref name="pmid19348394">{{cite journal |author=Widimsk<U+00FD> J |title=[The combination of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker is an optimal combination for the treatment of hypertension] |language=Czech |journal=[[Vnitr<U+0306>n<U+00ED> L<U+00E9>kar<U+0306>stv<U+00ED>]] |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=123<U+2013>30 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19348394 |doi= |url= |issn= |accessdate=2009-06-02}}</ref>
*A fixed combination of a diuretic and an [[Angiotensin II receptor antagonist|ARB]].

Combinations of an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II<U+2013>receptor antagonist, a diuretic and an NSAID (including selective COX-2 inhibitors and non-prescribed drugs such as ibuprofen) should be avoided whenever possible due to a high documented risk of acute renal failure. The combination is known colloquially as a "triple whammy" in the Australian health industry.<ref name="npsppr" />

===In the elderly===
Treating moderate to severe high blood pressure decreases death rates in those under 80 years of age.<ref name=Cochrane09/> In those over 80 years old there was a decrease in [[morbidity]] but no decrease in mortality.<ref name=Cochrane09>{{cite journal |author=Musini VM, Tejani AM, Bassett K, Wright JM |title=Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in the elderly |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD000028 |year=2009 |pmid=19821263 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000028.pub2 |url=}}</ref> The recommended BP goal is <140/90&nbsp;mm Hg with [[thiazide diuretic]]s being the first line medication.<ref>http://content.onlinejacc.org/cgi/reprint/j.jacc.2011.01.008v1.pdf ACCF/AHA 2011 Expert Consensus Document on Hypertension in the Elderly</ref>

==History==
[[Image:William Harvey ( 1578-1657) Venenbild.jpg|Image of veins from Harvey's ''Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus'' | right|thumb]]
Some cite the writings of [[Sushruta]] in the 6th century BC as being the first mention of symptoms like those of hypertension.<ref name=Dwivedi&Dwivedi07>Dwivedi, Girish & Dwivedi, Shridhar (2007). [http://medind.nic.in/iae/t07/i4/iaet07i4p243.pdf ''History of Medicine: Sushruta <U+2013> the Clinician <U+2013> Teacher par Excellence'']. [[National Informatics Centre|National Informatics Centre (Government of India)]].</ref> Others propose even earlier descriptions dating as far as 2600 BCE. Main treatment for what was called the "hard pulse disease" consisted in reducing the quantity of blood in a subject by the sectioning of veins or the application of [[leech]]es.<ref name="pmid1744849">{{cite journal |author=Esunge PM |title=From blood pressure to hypertension: the history of research |journal=J R Soc Med |volume=84 |issue=10 |pages=621 |year=1991 |month=October |pmid=1744849 |pmc=1295564}}</ref> Well known individuals such as The [[Yellow Emperor]] of China, [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Cornelius Celsus]], [[Galen]], and [[Hipocrates]] advocated such treatments.<ref name="pmid1744849"/>

Our modern understanding of hypertension began with the work of physician [[William Harvey]] (1578<U+2013>1657), who was the first to describe correctly the systemic circulation of blood being pumped around the body by the heart in his book "''De motu cordis''". The basis for measuring blood pressure were established by [[Stephen Hales]] in 1733.<ref name="pmid1744849"/> Initial descriptions of hypertension as a disease came among others from [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1808 and specially [[Richard Bright (physician)|Richard Bright]] in 1836.<ref name="pmid1744849"/> The first ever elevated blood pressure in a patient without kidney disease was reported by Frederick Mahomed (1849<U+2013>1884).<ref>{{cite book |author= edited by J.D. Swales.|title=Manual of hypertension |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Oxford |year=1995 |pages=xiii |isbn=0-86542-861-1}}</ref> It was not until 1904 that sodium restriction was advocated while a rice diet was popularized around 1940.<ref name="pmid1744849"/>

Studies in the 1920s demonstrated the [[public health]] impact of untreated high blood pressure; treatment options were limited at the time, and deaths from malignant hypertension and its complications were common. A prominent victim of severe hypertension leading to cerebral hemorrhage was [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (1882<U+2013>1945). The [[Framingham Heart Study]] added to the epidemiological understanding of hypertension and its relationship with coronary artery disease. The [[National Institutes of Health]] also sponsored other population studies, which additionally showed that African Americans had a higher burden of hypertension and its complications.<ref name=Dustan>{{cite journal |author=Dustan HP, Roccella EJ, Garrison HH |title=Controlling hypertension. A research success story |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=156 |issue=17 |pages=1926<U+2013>35 |year=1996 |month=September |pmid=8823146 |doi=10.1001/archinte.156.17.1926}}</ref> Before pharmacological treatment for hypertension became possible, three treatment modalities were used, all with numerous side-effects: strict sodium restriction, [[sympathectomy]] (surgical ablation of parts of the [[sympathetic nervous system]]), and pyrogen therapy (injection of substances that caused a fever, indirectly reducing blood pressure).<ref name="pmid1744849"/><ref name=Dustan/>

The first chemical for hypertension, [[sodium thiocyanate]], was used in 1900 but had many side effects and was unpopular.<ref name="pmid1744849"/> Several other agents were developed after the [[World War II|Second World War]], the most popular and reasonably effective of which were [[tetramethylammonium chloride]] and its derivative [[hexamethonium]], [[hydralazine]] and [[reserpine]] (derived from the medicinal plant ''[[Rauwolfia serpentina]]''). A [[randomized controlled trial]] sponsored by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] using these drugs had to be stopped early because those not receiving treatment were developing more complications and it was deemed unethical to withhold treatment from them. These studies prompted public health campaigns to increase public awareness of hypertension and the advice to get blood pressure measured and treated. These measures appear to have contributed at least in part of the observed 50% fall in stroke and ischemic heart disease between 1972 and 1994.<ref name=Dustan/>

A major breakthrough was achieved with the discovery of the first well-tolerated orally available agents. The first was [[chlorothiazide]], the first [[thiazide]] and developed from the antibiotic [[sulfanilamide]], which became available in 1958;<ref name="pmid1744849"/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Novello FC, Sprague JM | title=Benzothiadiazine dioxides as novel diuretics | journal=J Am Chem Soc | year=1957 | volume=79 | pages=2028 | doi=10.1021/ja01565a079}}</ref> it increased salt excretion while preventing fluid accumulation. In 1975, the [[Lasker Award|Lasker Special Public Health Award]] was awarded to the team that developed chlorothiazide.<ref name=Dustan/> The British physician [[James W. Black]] developed [[beta blocker]]s in the early 1960s;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Black JW, Crowther AF, Shanks RG, Smith LH, Dornhorst AC |title=A new adrenergic betareceptor antagonist|journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=7342 |pages=1080<U+2013>1 |year=1964 |month=May |pmid=14132613 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(64)91275-9}}</ref> these were initially used for [[angina pectoris|angina]], but turned out to lower blood pressure. Black received the 1976 [[Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award|Lasker Award]] and in 1988 the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his discovery.<ref name=Dustan/> The next class of antihypertensives to be discovered was that of the calcium channel blockers. The first member was [[verapamil]], a derivative of [[papaverine]] that was initially thought to be a beta blocker and used for angina, but then turned out to have a different mode of action and was shown to lower blood pressure.<ref name=Dustan/> ACE inhibitors were developed through [[Drug design|rational drug design]]; the renin-angiotensin system was known to play an important role in blood pressure regulation, and snake venom from ''[[Bothrops jararaca]]'' could lower blood pressure through inhibition of ACE. In 1977 [[captopril]], an orally active agent, was described;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ondetti MA, Rubin B, Cushman DW |title=Design of specific inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme: new class of orally active antihypertensive agents |journal=Science |volume=196 |issue=4288 |pages=441<U+2013>4 |year=1977 |month=April |pmid=191908 |doi=10.1126/science.191908}}</ref> this led to the development of a number of other ACE inhibitors.<ref name=Dustan/>

High blood pressure is the most common chronic medical problem prompting visits to primary health care providers, yet it is estimated that only 34% of the 50 million American adults with hypertension have their blood pressure controlled to a level of <140/90&nbsp;mm Hg.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1524-6175.2003.02463.x/full |title = The Economic Impact of Hypertension }}</ref> Thus, about two thirds of Americans with hypertension are at increased risk for heart disease. The medical, economic, and human costs of untreated and inadequately controlled high blood pressure are enormous.

[[The World Health Organization]] attributes hypertension, or high blood pressure, as the leading cause of [[cardiovascular]] [[Mortality rate|mortality]]. [[The World Hypertension League]] ([[The World Hypertension League|WHL]]), an umbrella organization of 85 national hypertension societies and leagues, recognized that more than 50% of the hypertensive population worldwide are unaware of their condition.<ref name="pmid17534457">{{cite journal |author=Chockalingam A |title=Impact of World Hypertension Day |journal=[[The Canadian Journal of Cardiology]] |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=517<U+2013>9 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17534457 |pmc=2650754 |doi= |url= |issn= |accessdate=2009-06-22}}</ref> To address this problem, the WHL initiated a global awareness campaign on hypertension in 2005 and dedicated May 17 of each year as [[World Hypertension Day]] ([[World Hypertension Day|WHD]]). Over the past three years, more national societies have been engaging in WHD and have been innovative in their activities to get the message to the public. In 2007, there was record participation from 47 member countries of the WHL. During the week of WHD, all these countries <U+2013> in partnership with their local governments, professional societies, nongovernmental organizations and private industries <U+2013> promoted hypertension awareness among the public through several [[Mass media|media]] and public rallies. Using [[mass media]] such as [[Internet]] and [[television]], the message reached more than 250 million people. As the momentum picks up year after year, the WHL is confident that almost all the estimated 1.5 billion people affected by elevated blood pressure can be reached.<ref name="pmid18548140">{{cite journal |author=Chockalingam A |title=World Hypertension Day and global awareness |journal=[[The Canadian Journal of Cardiology]] |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=441<U+2013>4 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18548140 |pmc=2643187 |doi= |url= |issn= |accessdate=2009-06-22}}</ref>
