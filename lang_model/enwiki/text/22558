Two independent approaches have been used to estimate the year of the birth of Jesus; one combines the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] accounts in the Gospels with other historical data, the other works backwards from the estimation of the start of the [[ministry of Jesus|his ministry]].{{sfnm|1a1=Maier|1y=1989|1pp=113-129|2a1=Niswonger|2y=1992|2pp=121-124}} The first approach uses [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#2:1|Matthew 2:1]]'s association of the birth of Jesus with the reign of [[Herod the Great]], who died around 4 BC/BCE and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#1:5|Luke 1:5]]'s mention of the reign of Herod shortly before the birth of Jesus.{{sfnm|Niswonger|1992|1pp=121-124|Rahner|2004|2pp=730-731|Niswonger|1992|3pp=121-124}} However, Luke's gospel also associates the birth with the [[Census of Quirinius|first census]], which was in 6 AD/CE.{{sfn|Vermes|2006|p=22}} The second approach ignores the Nativity accounts, and correlates  [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:13|John 2:13<U+2013>20]]'s statement about the [[Jerusalem Temple]] being in its 46th year of construction, with [[Josephus]]' dating of the death of [[John the Baptist]] to work backwards from the statement in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:23|Luke 3:23]] that Jesus was "about 30 years of age" at the start of his ministry.{{sfnm|K<U+00F6>stenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|1p=140|Maier|1989|2pp=113-129}} This approach indicates that around 27<U+2013>29 AD/CE, Jesus was "about thirty years of age".<ref name=Scarola /> Elsewhere, [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#8:57|John 8:57]] states that Jesus was less than fifty years old.

{{Main|Genealogy of Jesus|Nativity of Jesus}}
The accounts of the [[Genealogy of Jesus|genealogy]] and Nativity of Jesus in the New Testament appear only in the Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of Matthew. While there are documents outside of the New Testament which are more or less contemporary with Jesus and the gospels, many shed no light on the more biographical aspects of his life and these two gospel accounts remain the main sources of information on the genealogy and Nativity.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=3}}

Matthew begins his gospel in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#1:1|1:1]] with the genealogy of Jesus, and presents it before the account of the birth of Jesus, while Luke discusses the genealogy in chapter 3, after the Baptism of Jesus in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:23|Luke 3:22]] when the voice from Heaven addresses Jesus and identifies him as the [[Son of God]].<ref name=MaryBrown /> At that point Luke traces Jesus' ancestry through [[Adam]] to God.<ref name=MaryBrown >{{cite book|title=Mary in the New Testament|first= Raymond E.|last= Brown|year= 1978 |isbn= 0-8091-2168-9 |page= 163}}</ref>

The Gospel of John ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:28|1:28]]) specifies "Bethany beyond the Jordan", that is [[Bethabara]] in Perea, when it initially refers to it and later
[[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#3:23|John 3:23]] refers to further baptisms in [[<U+00C6>non]] "because there was much water there".<ref>{{cite book|title=Big Picture of the Bible <U+2013> New Testament|first=Lorna D. |last=Nichols |year=2009 |isbn= 1-57921-928-4 |page= 12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=John|first=Gerard S.|last= Sloyan|year= 1987| isbn= 0-8042-3125-7 |page= 11}}</ref>

The four gospels are not the only references to John's ministry around the River Jordan.

In the New Testament the teachings of Jesus are presented in terms of his "words and works".{{sfn|Walvoord|Zuck|1983|p=100}}<ref name=WPent212 /> The words of Jesus include a number of sermons, as well as [[Parables of Jesus|parables]] that appear throughout the narrative of the synoptic gospels (the Gospel of John includes no parables). The works include the [[Miracles of Jesus|miracles]] and other acts performed during his ministry.<ref name=WPent212 /> Although the canonical gospels are the major source of the teachings of Jesus, the [[Pauline epistles]], which were likely written decades before the gospels, provide some of the earliest written accounts of the teachings of Jesus.{{sfn|Blomberg|2009|pp=441<U+2013>442}}

The New Testament does not present the teachings of Jesus as merely his own preachings, but equates the words of Jesus with divine revelation, with John the Baptist stating in [[s:Bible (NIV)/John#3:34|John 3:34]]: "For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit"; and in [[s:Bible (NIV)/John#7:16|John 7:16]]: "Jesus answered, 'My teaching is not my own.

In the New Testament, the Last Supper is the final meal that Jesus shares with his [[Twelve Apostles#The Twelve Apostles|twelve apostles]] in Jerusalem before his crucifixion. The Last Supper is mentioned in all four canonical gospels, and Paul's [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#11:23|11:23<U+2013>26]]), which was likely written before the gospels, also refers to it.<ref name=Fahlbusch52 >{{cite book|title=The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 4| first=Erwin |last=Fahlbusch|year= 2005| isbn= 978-0-8028-2416-5 |pages= 52<U+2013>56}}</ref>{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=465<U+2013>477}}<ref>[[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:20|Matthew 26:20]], [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#14:17|Mark 14:17]], [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:21<U+2013>23|Luke 22:21<U+2013>23]] [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#13:1|John 13:1]]</ref>{{sfn|Cox|2007|pp=180<U+2013>191}}

In all four gospels, during the meal, Jesus [[Jesus predicts his betrayal|predicts that]] one of his Apostles will betray him.{{sfn|Cox|2007|p=182}} Jesus is described as reiterating, despite each Apostle's assertion that he would not betray Jesus, that the betrayer would be one of those who were present. In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:23|Matthew 26:23<U+2013>25]] and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#13:26|John 13:26<U+2013>27]] Judas is specifically singled out as the traitor.<ref name=Fahlbusch52 />{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=465<U+2013>477}}{{sfn|Cox|2007|p=182}}

In all four gospels Jesus predicts that Peter will deny knowledge of him, stating that Peter will disown him three times before the [[rooster]] crows the next morning. The synoptics mention that after the [[arrest of Jesus]] Peter denied knowing him three times, but after the third denial, heard the rooster crow and recalled the prediction as Jesus turned to look at him.

After the trials, Jesus made his way to [[Calvary]] (the path is traditionally called [[via Dolorosa]]) and the three synoptic gospels indicate that he was assisted by [[Simon of Cyrene]], the Romans compelling him to do so.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509-520}}{{sfn|K<U+00F6>stenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=211<U+2013>214}} In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#23:27|Luke 23:27<U+2013>28]] Jesus tells the women in the multitude of people following him not to cry for him but for themselves and their children.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509-520}} Once at Calvary (Golgotha), Jesus was offered wine mixed with gall to drink&nbsp;<U+2013> usually offered as a form of painkiller.

=== Historicity of events ===

{{Main|Historicity of Jesus}}
{{see also|Cultural and historical background of Jesus|History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|Higher criticism|Textual criticism|Historical reliability of the Gospels}}
Modern scholars consider the [[baptism of Jesus]] and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|his crucifixion]] to be the two historically certain facts about him, [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]] stating that these "two facts in the life of Jesus command almost universal assent".{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=339}} Dunn states that these two facts "rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny' scale of historical facts" that they are often the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus.{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=339}} [[Bart Ehrman]] states that the crucifixion of Jesus on the orders of [[Pontius Pilate]] is the most certain element about him.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Brief Introduction to the New Testament|first= Bart D.|last= Ehrman|year= 2008| isbn= 0-19-536934-3 |page= 136}}</ref> [[John Dominic Crossan]] states that the crucifixion of Jesus is as certain as any historical fact can be.<ref name=Crossan1995/>

[[Craig Blomberg]] states that most scholars in the third [[quest for the historical Jesus]] consider the crucifixion indisputable.{{sfn|Blomberg|2009|pp=211<U+2013>214}} Although scholars agree on the historicity of the crucifixion, they differ on the reason and context for it. Both [[E.P. Sanders]] and [[Paula Fredriksen]] support the historicity of the crucifixion, but contend that Jesus did not foretell of his own crucifixion, and that his prediction of the crucifixion is a Christian story.<ref name=Ernest125/> [[Geza Vermes]] also views the crucifixion a historical event but provides his own explanation and background for it.<ref name=Ernest125>{{cite book |title=A Century of Theological and Religious Studies in Britain, 1902<U+2013>2002| first= Ernest |last=Nicholson |year=2004| isbn= 0-19-726305-4 |pages= 125<U+2013>126}}</ref> [[John P.

Although scholars agree on basic historical facts such as the crucifixion of Jesus, the various "portraits of Jesus" they construct often differ from each other, and from the descriptions found in the gospels.{{sfn|K<U+00F6>stenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=117<U+2013>125}}<ref>{{harvnb|Sanders |1993| p= 57}}

Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly [[Quest for the historical Jesus|quests for the historical Jesus]] have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during that phase.{{sfn|Witherington|1997|pp=9<U+2013>13}}{{sfn|Powell|1998|pp=19-23}} The second quest which started in 1953 reached a plateau in the 1970s and by 1992 the term third quest had been coined to characterize the new research approaches.<ref>{{harvnb|Van Voorst| 2000| pp=2<U+2013>6}}

In the third quest, research on the historical Jesus entered a new phase, and although a new emphasis on methods emerged, [[Gerd Theissen]] and [[Dagmar Winter]] stated that by early 21st century due to the fragmentation of the portraits of Jesus no unified picture of Jesus could be attained at all.{{sfn|Theissen|Winter|2002|p=5}} Echoing the same scenario, [[Ben Witherington III|Ben Witherington]] states that "there are now as many portraits of the historical Jesus as there are scholarly painters".{{sfn|Witherington|1997|p=77}}

Thus while there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence of Jesus, the portraits of Jesus constructed in these quests often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.{{sfn|Theissen|Winter|2002|p=5}}<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Historical Jesus, Quest of the| encyclopedia = Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church|page= 775}}</ref> The mainstream profiles in the third quest may be grouped together based on their primary theme as ''[[apocalyptic|apocalyptic prophet]]'', ''charismatic healer'', ''[[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic philosopher]]'', ''Jewish Messiah'' and an [[egalitarian]] ''prophet of social change''.<ref name=CambHist23>{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Christianity, Volume 1 |first1= Margaret M.|last1= Mitchell |first2= Frances M. |last2=Young |year= 2006| isbn= 0-521-81239-9| page= 23}}</ref>{{sfn|K<U+00F6>stenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=124<U+2013>125}} There are, however, overlapping attributes among the portraits and pairs of scholars which may differ on some attributes may agree on others.<ref name=CambHist23/>{{sfn|K<U+00F6>stenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=124<U+2013>125}}{{sfn|McClymond|2004|pp=16<U+2013>22}}

There are a number of variants to each of these portraits of Jesus, and some scholars reject the basic elements of some portraits, e.g. regarding the "Messiah portrait" scholars such as [[Larry Hurtado]] suggest that Jesus may have never claimed to be the Messiah or the Son of God, and the titles may be later applications.{{sfn|Rausch|2003|p=127}}<ref>{{cite book|title=How On Earth Did Jesus Become a God?| first= Larry W.|last= Hurtado |year= 2005|ISBN= 0802828612 |pages= 36<U+2013>37}}</ref> Other scholars such as [[N.

Meier]] and N. T. Wright contend), or if he imposed no hierarchy and preached to all in equal terms, as suggested by [[John Dominic Crossan]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Prophet and Teacher: An Introduction to the Historical Jesus|first=William R. |last=Herzog |year= 2005) |ISBN= 0664225284 |pages= 1-6}}</ref>

[[Amy-Jill Levine]] states that there is, however, "a consensus of sorts" on the basic outline of Jesus' life in that most scholars agree that Jesus [[Baptism of Jesus|was baptized]] by [[John the Baptist]], debated Jewish authorities on the subject of God, performed some healings, gathered followers, and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|was crucified]] by Roman prefect [[Pontius Pilate]].{{sfn|Levine|2006|p=4}}

[[Donald Akenson]] has argued that, with very few exceptions, the historians of Yeshua have not followed sound historical practices. He has stated that there is an unhealthy [[argumentum ad populum|reliance on consensus]], for propositions which should otherwise be based on primary sources, or rigorous interpretation. He also holds that some of the criteria being used are faulty.<ref name=Aken539>{{cite book|last1=Akenson|first1=Donald|title=Surpassing wonder: the invention of the Bible and the Talmuds|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1998|pages=539<U+2013>555|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=40E8am9SlwgC&pg=PA540&lpg=PA541#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=2011-Jan-08|quote=...&nbsp;The point I shall argue below is that, the agreed evidentiary practices of the historians of Jesus, despite their best efforts, have not been those of sound historical practice&nbsp;...}}</ref>

In a review of the state of modern scholarship, [[Amy-Jill Levine]] writes that the entire category of ethnicity is fraught with difficulty. Beyond recognizing that "Jesus was Jewish", rarely does the scholarship address what being "Jewish" means.{{sfn|Levine|2006|p=10}} In the [[New Testament]], written in [[Koine Greek]], Jesus was referred to as an [[Ioudaios]] (i.e. "Judean") on three occasions, although he did not refer to himself as such. These three occasions are (1) by the [[Biblical Magi]] in [[Matthew 2]] who referred to Jesus as [[Jesus, King of the Jews|"basileus ton ioudaion"]]; (2) by the [[Samaritan woman at the well]] in [[John 4]] when Jesus was travelling out of Judea; and (3) by the Romans in all four gospels during [[Passion (Christianity)|the Passion]] who also used the phrase [[Jesus, King of the Jews|"basileus ton ioudaion"]].<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink=John Elliott (historian)|first=John |last=Elliott|journal= Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus |year=2007|volume= 5|issue= 119}}</ref> According to [[Amy-Jill Levine]], in light of the Holocaust, the Jewishness of Jesus increasingly has been highlighted.

Some people believe in the authenticity of some relics; others doubt the authenticity of various items. For instance, the sixteenth century Catholic theologian [[Erasmus]] wrote sarcastically about the proliferation of relics, and the number of buildings that could have been constructed from the wood claimed to be from the [[True Cross|cross]] used in the [[Crucifixion of Christ]].{{sfn|Dillenberger|1999|p=5}} Similarly, while experts debate whether Christ was crucified with three or with four nails, at least thirty [[Holy Nail]]s continue to be venerated as relics across Europe.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle =Holy Nails|title=Holy Nails|first= Herbert|last=Thurston}}</ref>

Some relics, such as purported remnants of the [[Crown of Thorns]], receive only a modest number of pilgrims, others such as the [[Shroud of Turin]] (which is associated with an approved [[Catholic devotion]] to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]]) receive millions of pilgrims, which in recent years have included [[Pope John Paul II]] and [[Pope Benedict XVI]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pope John Paul II|authorlink=Pope John Paul II|title=Pope John Paul II's address in Turin Cathedral|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/travels/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_24051998_sindone_en.html|publisher=Holy See|date=1998-05-24}}</ref>

== Religious perspectives ==
{{Main|Religious perspectives on Jesus}}
Apart from his own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day generally rejected him as the Messiah, as do Jews today. For their part, Christian [[Church Fathers]], [[Ecumenical Council]]s, Reformers, and others have written extensively about Jesus over the centuries. [[Christian sect]]s and [[Christian schisms|schisms]] have often been defined or characterized by competing descriptions of Jesus. Meanwhile, [[Manichaeans]], [[Gnostics]], Muslims, Baha'is, and others have found prominent places for Jesus in their own religious accounts.<ref>{{harvnb|Bockmuehl| 2001| pp= 156<U+2013>157}}

These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his [[God the Son|divinity]], [[Hypostatic union|humanity]], and earthly life. Generally speaking, adhering to the Christian faith requires a belief that Jesus is the [[Christ]] and the [[Son of God]]. In the New Testament Jesus indicates that he is the Son of God by calling God his father.<ref name="OneTeacher"/> However, not all [[Christian denominations]] agree on all doctrines, and both [[East<U+2013>West Schism|major and minor differences]] on teachings and beliefs have persisted throughout Christianity for centuries.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Great Schism| encyclopedia = Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |publisher= Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn= 978-0-19-280290-3}}</ref>

Christians consider Jesus the [[Christ]] and believe that through [[Resurrection of Jesus|his death and resurrection]], humans can be [[reconciliation (theology)|reconciled to God]] and thereby are offered [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] and the promise of [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford Companion to the Bible|first1=Bruce M.|last1= Metzger|first2= Michael D.|last2= Coogan| page= 649| publisher=Oxford University Press| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Y2KGVuym5OUC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> These teachings emphasize that as the willing [[Lamb of God]], Jesus ''chose to'' suffer in [[Calvary]] as a sign of his full obedience to the will of the [[God the Father|Eternal Father]], as an "agent and servant of God".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Christology of the New Testament|first= Oscar |last=Cullmann |year=1959 |isbn= 0-664-24351-7| page= 79}}

Most Christians believe that Jesus was both human and the Son of God. While there has been theological debate over the nature of Jesus, [[Trinity|Trinitarian]] Christians generally believe that Jesus is the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]], [[God the Son]], and "[[Hypostatic union|true God and true man]]" (or both fully divine and fully human). [[Nontrinitarianism|Nontrinitarian]] Christians reject the notion of the [[Holy Trinity]], do not adhere to the [[ecumenical council]]s and believe that their interpretations of the Bible take precedence over the [[Christian creeds]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Leo D.|last= Davis |title=The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325<U+2013>787): Their History and Theology|year= 1990 |isbn= 978-0-8146-5616-7 |page= 68}}</ref>

=== Jewish views ===
{{Main|Judaism's view of Jesus}}
{{see also|Jesus in the Talmud}}

[[Judaism]] rejects the idea of Jesus being God, or a person of a Trinity, or a mediator to God. Judaism also holds that Jesus is not the [[Jewish Messianism|Messiah]], arguing that he had not fulfilled the [[Messianic prophecies]] in the [[Tanakh]] nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah. According to Jewish tradition, there were no prophets after [[Malachi]], who delivered his prophesies about 420 BC/BCE.<ref>[[Shraga Simmons|Simmons, Shraga]], "[http://www.aish.com/jewishissues/jewishsociety/Why_Jews_Dont_Believe_In_Jesus.asp Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus]", Retrieved 2007-04-15; "[http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/2637/Q1/ Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus]", [[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Samayach]]&nbsp;<U+2013> ''Ask the Rabbi'', Retrieved 2007-04-15; "[http://www.askmoses.com/qa_detail.html?h=120&o=350 Why do not Jews believe that Jesus was the Messiah?]", [[AskMoses.com]], Retrieved 2007-04-15</ref>

The New Testament states that Jesus was criticized by the Jewish authorities of his time. The [[Pharisee]]s and [[scribe]]s criticized Jesus and his disciples for not observing the Mosaic Law, not washing their hands before eating ({{bibleverse||Mark|7:1<U+2013>23|ESV}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|15:1<U+2013>20|esv}}), and gathering grain on the Sabbath ({{bibleverse||Mark|2:23<U+2013>3:6|esv}}). Jesus continued to be criticized by Judaism, and in the early 12th century, the [[Mishneh Torah]] (the last established consensus of the Jewish community) called Jesus a "stumbling block" who makes "the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God".

The [[Talmud]] includes stories which some consider accounts of [[Jesus in the Talmud]], although there is a spectrum{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000|p=108}} from scholars, such as [[Johann Maier (talmudic scholar)|Maier]] (1978), who considers that only the accounts with the name ''[[Yeshu]]'' {{lang|he|<U+05D9><U+05B5><U+05E9><U+05C1><U+05D5><U+05BC>}} refer to the Christian Jesus, and that these are late redactions, to scholars such as [[Joseph Klausner|Klausner]] (1925), who suggested that accounts related to Jesus in the Talmud may contain traces of the [[historical Jesus]]. However the majority of contemporary historians disregard this material as providing information on the historical Jesus.<ref name = "TM1998">Theissen, Gerd and Annette Merz.

The ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', an authoritative work of [[Halakha|Jewish law]], provides the last established consensus view of the Jewish community, in ''Hilkhot Melakhim'' 11:10<U+2013>12 that Jesus is a "stumbling block" who makes "the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God".<ref>[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/e511.htm Hilchot Malachim (laws concerning kings) (Hebrew)]", MechonMamre.org, Retrieved 2007-04-15</ref> According to Conservative Judaism, Jews who believe Jesus is the Messiah have "crossed the line out of the Jewish community".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscj.org/Messianic_Jews_Not_J5480.html|title=Messianic Jews Are Not Jews|accessdate=2008-01-15|last=Waxman|first=Jonathan|year=2006|publisher=[[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism]]|quote=Judaism has held that the Mashiach will come and usher in a new era; not that he will proclaim his arrival, die and wait centuries to finish his task.

Numerous other titles are given to Jesus in [[Islamic literature]], the most common being ''al-Mas<U+012B><U+1E25>'' ("the messiah"). Jesus is also, at times, called "Seal of the Israelite Prophets", because, in general Muslim belief, Jesus was the last [[prophet]] sent by [[God]] to guide the Children of Israel. Jesus is seen in Islam as a precursor to Muhammad, and is believed by Muslims to have foretold the latter's coming.<ref name="EoI-Isa"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Comparative Religious Ethics: A Narrative Approach|first1=Darrell J.|last1= Fasching |first2= Dell |last2=deChant|year=2001| page= 241|isbn=978-0-631-20125-0}}</ref> To aid in his ministry to the [[Jews|Jewish]] people, Jesus was given the ability to perform [[miracle]]s, all by the permission of God rather than of his own power.

The Qur'an emphasizes that Jesus was a mortal human being who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. Islamic texts forbid the association of partners with God (''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]''), emphasizing a strict notion of [[monotheism]] (''[[tawhid|tawh<U+012B>d]]'').

Islam rejects the [[Christian]] view that Jesus was [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]] or the [[Son of God]], that he was ever [[Crucifixion|crucified]] or [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]], or that he ever [[Atonement in Christianity|atoned]] for the sins of mankind. The Qur'an says that Jesus himself never claimed any of these things, and it furthermore indicates that Jesus will deny having ever claimed divinity at the [[Islamic view of the Last Judgment|Last Judgment]], and God will vindicate him (Quran 5:116). According to Muslim traditions, [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus was not crucified]] but instead, he was raised up by God unto the heavens. This "raising" is understood to mean through bodily [[Jesus in Islam#Ascension|ascension]].
