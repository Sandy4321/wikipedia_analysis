In the early 19th century Puerto Rican culture, which was basically made up of a mixture of the Spanish, Taino and African cultures, became even more diversified with the arrival of hundreds families from non-Hispanic countries such as [[Corsican immigration to Puerto Rico|Corsica]], [[French immigration to Puerto Rico|France]], [[German immigration to Puerto Rico|Germany]] and [[Irish immigration to Puerto Rico|Ireland]]. This came about because of the concessions made by the ''Real Cedula de Gracias de 1815'' ("[[Royal Decree of Graces of 1815]]"), which allowed European Catholics to settle in the island with land allotments in the interior of the island, provided they agreed to pay taxes and continue to support the Catholic Church.

One of the consequences of the diversification of the cultures is that there are many Puerto Ricans and people of Puerto Rican decent who have non-Hispanic surnames. The surnames of Puerto Ricans are not limited to those which originated in Spain. Various factors have contributed to the immigration of people from non-Hispanic countries to the island. They came from many European countries to Puerto Rico, where they adopted the local customs and intermarried with the locals. In Puerto Rico it is common for the people to use both, their fathers and mothers surnames, therefore it is not unusual to find someone with a non-Hispanic surname and a Hispanic surname. Two examples are [[Ramon Power y Giralt]] and [[Demetrio O'Daly|Demetrio O'Daly y Puente]]. Both of these Puerto Ricans have their father<U+2019>s Irish surname and their mother<U+2019>s Spanish surname.<ref name="MP">"Mainland Passage: The Cultural Anomaly of Puerto Rico"; by: Ramon E. Soto-Crespo; Publisher: Univ Of Minnesota Press; ISBN-10: 0816655871; ISBN-13: 978-0816655878</ref> Other factors, such as the Great Depression and World War II, contributed to the large migration of Puerto Ricans to the United States mainland. Many Puerto Ricans married with non-Hispanics and had children of Puerto Rican descent who were inscribed with non-Hispanic surnames.<ref name="MP"/>

The influence of the mixture of the cultures of the Hispanic and non-Hispanic immigrants in Puerto Rico are evident in the island's political, commercial and religious structures.

==First settlers==
The first people from Europe to arrive in Puerto Rico were the [[Spanish Conquistadores]]. The island, called Boriken, at that time was inhabited by the [[Ta<U+00ED>no|Ta<U+00ED>no Amerindians]]. Many Jews also known as "converso" came to Puerto Rico as members of the Spanish crews. The Jews who arrived and settled in Puerto Rico were referred to as "Crypto-Jews" or "secret Jews". When the Crypto Jews arrived on the island of Puerto Rico, they were hoping to avoid religious scrutiny, but the Inquisition followed the colonists. The Inquisition maintained no rota or religious court in Puerto Rico. However, heretics were written up and if necessary remanded to regional Inquisitional tribunals in Spain or elsewhere in the western hemisphere. As a result, many secret Jews settled the island's remote mountainous interior far from the concentrated centers of power in San Juan and lived quiet lives. They practiced Crypto-Judaism which meant that they secretly practiced Judaism while publicly professing to be Roman Catholic.<ref name="ND">Vazquez, Larizza, [http://www.prfrogui.com/home/judios.htm "Judios en Secreto"], ''El Nuevo Dia'', December 8, 2000, (Spanish), Retrieved November  12, 2008.</ref>

The Spaniards enslaved the Tainos (the native inhabitants of the island), and many of them died as a result of Spaniards' oppressive colonization efforts. This presented a problem for Spain's royal government, which relied on slavery to staff their mining and fort-building operations. Spain's 'solution': import enslaved west-Africans. The slaves were baptized by the Catholic Church and assumed the surnames of their owners.<ref>[http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/philosophers/las_casas.html Bartolom<U+00E9> de las Casas. Oregon State University], Retrieved July 20, 2007</ref>

By 1570, the gold mines were declared depleted of the precious metal. After gold mining came to an end on the island, the Spanish Crown bypassed Puerto Rico by moving the western shipping routes to the north. The island became primarily a garrison for those ships that would pass on their way to or from richer colonies.<ref>[http://www.viaccess.net/~crucian/caron.htm The First West African on St. Croix?], Retrieved July 20, 2007</ref>.<ref name="Diaz">[http://web.archive.org/web/20071214000250/http://www.ipoaa.com/africa_puertorico.htm African Aspects of the Puerto Rican Personality by (the late) Dr. Robert A. Martinez, Baruch College]. (Archived from [http://www.ipoaa.com/africa_puertorico.htm the original] on July 20, 2007)</ref>

==The Africans==
{{Main article|African immigration to Puerto Rico}}
A Spanish edict of 1664 offered freedom and land to African people from non-Spanish colonies, such as Jamaica and St. Dominique (Haiti), who immigrated to Puerto Rico and provided a population base to support the Puerto Rican garrison and its forts. Those freeman who settled the western and southern parts of the island soon adopted the ways and customs of the Spaniards. Some joined the local militia which fought against the British in their many attempts to invade the island. The escaped African slaves kept their former masters surnames; the free Africans who had emigrated from the West Indies had European surnames from those colonists, too. Such surnames tended to be either British or French therefore, it was common for Puerto Ricans of African ancestry to have non-Spanish surnames.<ref name="Diaz"/>

The descendants of the former African slaves became instrumental in the development of Puerto Rico's political, economic and cultural structure. They overcame many obstacles and have made their presence felt with their contributions to the island's entertainment, sports, literature and scientific institutions. Their contributions and heritage can still be felt today in Puerto Rico's art, music, cuisine, and religious beliefs in everyday life. In Puerto Rico, March 22 is known as "Abolition Day" and it is a holiday celebrated by those who live in the island.<ref>[http://www.shagtown.com/days/puertorico.html Encyclopedia of Days], Retrieved August 8, 2007</ref>

==The Irish==
{{Main article|Irish immigration to Puerto Rico}}
[[Image:Ramon PowerX.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Plaque honoring Ramon Power y Giralt in San German, Puerto Rico]]
From the 16th to the 19th century, there was considerable Irish immigration to Puerto Rico, for a number of reasons. During the 16th century many Irishmen, who were known as "[[Flight of the Wild Geese|Wild Geese]]", fled the English Army and joined the Spanish Army. Some of these men were stationed in Puerto Rico and remained there after their military service to Spain was completed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/CISS/mmspain.php|title=Irish and Scottish Military Migration to Spain|publisher=Trinity College Dublin|date=2008-11-29|accessdate=26 May 2008}}</ref> During the 18th century men such as Field Marshal [[Alejandro O'Reilly]] and Colonel Tomas O'Daly were sent to the island to revamp the capital's fortifications.."<ref name=Cultura>''Instituto de Cultura Puertorrique<U+00F1>a''</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://users.ev1.net/~gpmoran/ch1.htm |title=The Celtic Connection |accessdate=November 29, 2008 |author= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher= }}</ref> O'Reilly was later appointed governor of colonial [[Louisiana]] in 1769 where he became known as "Bloody O'Reilly".<ref>[http://enlou.com/people/oreillya-bio.htm Alejandro O'Reilly 1725-1794], Retrieved November 29, 2008</ref> Irish immigrants played in instrumental role in the islands economy. One of the most important industries of the island was the sugar industry. Besides Tom<U+00E1>s O'Daly whose plantation was a success, other Irishmen became successful businessmen in this industry, among them Miguel Conway, who owned a plantation in the town of Hatillo and Juan Nagle whose plantation was located in R<U+00ED>o Piedras. Puerto Ricans of Irish descent also played an instrumental role in the development of the islands tobacco industry. Miguel Conboy is credited with being the founder of the tobacco trade in Puerto Rico and the Quinlan family established two tobacco plantations, one in the town of Toa Baja and the other in Lo<U+00ED>za.<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?q=Irlandes+en+Puerto+Rico&hl=en&start=20&sa=N Irish and Puerto Rico], Retrieved November 29, 2008</ref>

The Irish element of Puerto Rico is very much in evidence. Their contributions in Puerto Rico's agricultural industry and in the field of politics and education are highly notable.<ref name="Irish">[http://www.angelfire.com/wi/shamrockclubwisc/Reflections/page102.html Emerald Reflections]</ref>

==The French==
{{Main article|French immigration to Puerto Rico}}
The French immigration to Puerto Rico began as a result of the economic and political situations which occurred in various places such as Louisiana (USA) and Saint-Domingue (Haiti). Upon the outbreak of the French and Indian War, also known as the Seven Years' War (1754-1763), between the Kingdom of Great Britain and its North American Colonies against France, many of the French settlers fled to Puerto Rico.<ref>[http://www.historicalpreservation.org Historical Preservation Archive: Transcribed Articles & Documents]</ref> In the 1791, Saint-Domingue (Haiti) uprising, slaves were organized into an army led by the self-appointed general Toussaint Louverture and rebelled against the French. The ultimate victory of the slaves over their white masters came about after the Battle of Verti<U+00E8>res in 1803.<ref>[http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/beard63/beard63.html Toussaint L'Ouverture: A Biography and Autobiography by J. R. Beard, 1863]</ref> The French fled to Santo Domingo and made their way to Puerto Rico. Once there, they settled in the western region of the island in towns such as Mayag<U+00FC>ez. With their expertise, they helped develop the island's sugar industry, converting Puerto Rico into a world leader in the exportation of sugar.<ref>[http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/DIASPORA/HAITI.HTM The Haitian Revolution]</ref> Their influence in Puerto Rico is very much present and in evidence in the island's [[Cuisine of Puerto Rico|cuisine]], [[Puerto Rican literature|literature]] and arts.<ref>[http://www.whats4eats.com/4rec_puertor.html Puerto Rican Cuisine & Recipes]</ref>

==Royal Decree of Graces of 1815==
{{Main article|Royal Decree of Graces of 1815}}
[[Image:Real C<U+00E9>dula de Gracia.jpg|right|100px|thumb|Royal Decree of Graces, 1815]]
By 1825, the Spanish Empire had lost all of its territories in the Americas with the exception of Cuba and Puerto Rico. These two possessions, however, had been demanding more autonomy since the formation of pro-independence movements in 1808. Realizing that it was in danger of losing its two remaining Caribbean territories, the Spanish Crown revived the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815. The decree was printed in three languages <U+2014> Spanish, English and French <U+2014> intending to attract Europeans of non-Spanish origin, with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity and strength with the arrival of new settlers. Under the Spanish Royal Decree of Graces, immigrants were granted land and initially given a "Letter of Domicile" after swearing loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Catholic Church. After five years they could request a "Letter of Naturalization" that would make them Spanish subjects. The Royal Decree, was intended for non-Hispanic Europeans and not Asians nor people that were not Christian.

==Potato Famine==
Many economic and political changes occurred in Europe during the latter part of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. Hundreds of farm workers abandoned their work in agriculture and moved to the larger cities with the advent of the Second Industrial Revolution in search of better paying jobs. Those who stayed behind and attended their farmlands suffered the consequences of the widespread crop failure brought upon as a result of long periods of drought and diseases such as the cholera epidemic and the potato fungus which caused the Great Irish Famine of 1840. Starvation was widespread in Europe. In Ireland, the Irish Potato Famine killed over one million Irish people and created nearly two million refugees. 
==The Corsicans==
{{Main article|Corsican immigration to Puerto Rico}}
[[Image:Steamship from Corsica.JPG|250px|left|thumb|Type of steamship in which Corsicans arrived in Puerto Rico]]
The island of Puerto Rico is very similar in geography to the island of Corsica and therefore appealed to the many Corsicans who wanted to start a "new" life. Hundreds of Corsicans and their families immigrated to Puerto Rico from as early as 1830, and their numbers peaked in the early 1900s. <ref name="Graces2">[http://www.icp.gobierno.pr/galeria/archivogeneral/documentos/index.htm  Archivo General de Puerto Rico: Documentos] Retrieved August  3, 2007</ref> The first Spanish settlers settled and owned the land in the coastal areas, the Corsicans tended to settle the mountainous southwestern region of the island, primary in the towns of [[Adjuntas]], [[Lares]], [[Utuado]], [[Ponce]], [[Coamo]], [[Yauco]], [[Guayanilla]] and [[Gu<U+00E1>nica]]. However, it was Yauco whose rich agricultural area attracted the majority of the Corsican settlers. The three main crops in Yauco were coffee, sugar cane and tobacco. The new settlers dedicated themselves to the cultivation of these crops and within a short period of time some were even able to own and operate their own grocery stores. However, it was with the cultivation of the coffee bean that they would make their fortunes. The descendants of the Corsican settlers were also to become influential in the fields of education, literature, journalism and politics.<ref>[http://www.rootsweb.com/~prsanjua/mis-022.htm Corsican immigration to Puerto Rico]</ref>
 
Today the town of Yauco is  known as both the "Corsican Town" and "The Coffee Town".  There's a memorial in Yauco with the inscription, "To the memory of our citizens of Corsican origin, France, who in the C19 became rooted in our village, who have enriched our culture with their traditions and helped our progress with their dedicated work - the municipality of Yauco pays them homage."  The Corsican element of Puerto Rico is very much in evidence, Corsican surnames such as Paoli, Negroni and Fraticelli are common.<ref>[http://www.rootsweb.com/~prhgs/corsican_01.htm Corsican  Immigrants to Puerto Rico], retrieved July 31, 2007</ref>

==The Germans==
{{Main article|German immigration to Puerto Rico}}
[[Image:SANTISIMATRINIDAD.gif|130px|right|thumb|Iglesia Sant<U+00ED>sima Trinidad of Ponce]]
German immigrants arrived in Puerto Rico from Cura<U+00E7>ao and Austria during the early 19th century. Many of these early German immigrants established warehouses and businesses in the coastal towns of Fajardo, Arroyo, Ponce, Mayag<U+00FC>ez, Cabo Rojo and Aguadilla. One of the reasons that these businessman established themselves in the island was that Germany depended mostly on Great Britain for such products as coffee, sugar and tobacco. By establishing businesses dedicated to the exportation and importation of these and other goods, Germany no longer had to pay the high tariffs which the English charged them. Not all of the immigrants were businessmen, some were teachers, farmers and skilled laborers.<ref>[http://home.coqui.net/uahorm/ Dr. Ursula Acosta: Genealogy: My Passion and Hobby<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In Germany the [[Revolutions of 1848|European Revolutions of 1848]] in the German states erupted, leading to the Frankfurt Parliament. Ultimately, the rather non-violent "revolution" failed. Disappointed, many Germans immigrated to the Americas and Puerto Rico, dubbed as the Forty-Eighters. The majority of these came from [[Alsace-Lorraine]], [[Baden]], [[Hesse]], [[Rheinland]] and [[W<U+00FC>rttemberg]].<ref>[Breunig, Charles (1977), ''The Age of Revolution and Reaction, 1789 - 1850'' (ISBN 0-393-09143-0)]</ref> German immigrants were able to settle in the coastal areas and establish their businesses in towns such as Fajardo, Arroyo, Ponce, Mayag<U+00FC>ez, Cabo Rojo and Aguadilla. Those who expected free land under the terms of the Spanish Royal Decree, settled in the central mountainous areas of the island in towns such as Adjuntas, Aibonito and Ciales among others. They made their living in the agricultural sector and in some cases became owners of sugar cane plantations. Others dedicated themselves to the fishing industry..<ref name="Alemanes">[http://www.preb.com/articulos/alemanes.htm  La Presencia Germanica en Puerto Rico]</ref> 

In 1870, the Spanish Courts passed the "Acta de Culto Condicionado" (Conditional Cult Act), a law granting the right of religious freedom to all those who wished to worship another religion other than the Catholic religion. The Anglican Church, the Iglesia Sant<U+00ED>sima Trinidad, was founded by German and English immigrants in Ponce in 1872.<ref name="Alemanes"/>

By the beginning of the 20th century, many of the descendants of the first German settlers had become successful businessmen, educators, and scientists and were among the pioneers of Puerto Rico's television industry. Among the successful businesses established by the German immigrants in Puerto Rico were Mullenhoff & Korber, Frite, Lundt & Co., Max Meyer & Co. and Feddersen Willenk & Co. Korber Group Inc. one of Puerto Rico's largest advertising agencies was founded by the descendants of William Korber.<ref>[http://korbergroup.com/Korber Group]</ref>

==The Chinese==
{{Main article|Chinese immigration to Puerto Rico}}
[[Image:Chineseexclusionact.JPG|thumb|left|100px|The first page of the Chinese Exclusion Act.]]
When the United States enacted the Chinese Exclusion Act on May 6, 1882, many Chinese in the United States fled to Puerto Rico, Cuba and other Latin American nations. They established small niches and worked in restaurants and laundries. The Chinese Exclusion Act, was a United States federal law which implemented the suspension of Chinese immigration. After the Spanish-American War, Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States under the conditions established by the Treaty of Paris of 1898. Chinese workers in the United States were allowed to travel to Puerto Rico. Some worked in the island's sugar industry, but most worked in re-building Puerto Rico's infrastructure and rail systems. Many of the workers in Puerto Rico decided to settle permanently in the island.

There are various businesses which are named "Los Chinos" (The Chinese) and there is a Valley in the town of [[Maunabo, Puerto Rico]] called "Quebrada Los Chinos" (The Chinese Stream).<ref>[http://www.placenames.com/us/p1611894/ Quebrada Los Chinos]</ref>  The Padmasambhava Buddhist Center, whose followers practice [[Tibetan Buddhism]], has a branch in Puerto Rico.<ref>[http://www.buddhanet.net/l_tibet.htm Budda Net]</ref>

==Post Spanish-American War==
After Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain to the United States at the end of the Spanish<U+2013>American War in 1898. Almost immediately, the United States began the <U+201C>[[Americanization]]<U+201D> process of Puerto Rico. The U.S. occupation brought about a total change in Puerto Rico<U+2019>s economy and [[polity]].<ref name="CT">

Baseball, which was invented in the United States, was introduced to the island by a group of Puerto Ricans and Cubans who learned the sport in the United States. The sport was also played by the American soldiers who organized games as part of their training. Puerto Ricans were also introduced to the sport of Boxing and Basketball by the occupying military forces.<ref name="PH">Primera Hora newspaper; "Eran otros tiempos"; by: Alex Figueroa Cancel, July 20, 2008</ref>

Many non-Hispanic soldiers who were assigned to the military bases in Puerto Rico choose to stay and live in the island.

[[Image:Shaare Zedeck.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Inside Sha'are Zedeck]]
Even though the frist Jews who arrived and settled in Puerto Rico were "Crypto-Jews" or "secret Jews", the Jewish community did not flurish in the island until after the Spanish-American War. Jewish-American soldiers were assigned to the military bases in Puerto Rico and many choose to stay and live on the island. Large numbers of Jewish immigrants began to arrive in Puerto Rico in the 1930s as refugees from Nazi occupied Europe. The majority settled in the island's capital, San Juan, where in 1942 they established the first Jewish Community Center of Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is home to the largest and wealthiest Jewish community in the Caribbean with almost 3,000 Jewish inhabitants.<ref name="JVL">[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Puerto_Rico.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour Puerto Rico], ''Jewish Virtual Library'', Retrieved November  12, 2008.</ref> Puerto Rican Jews have made many contributions to the Puerto Rican way of life.

==Puerto Rican migration to the United States==
Several factors contributed and led to what came to be known as "The Great Migration" of Puerto Ricans to New York. These were the following: the [[Great Depression]], [[World War II]] and the advent of air travel.

The Great Depression which spread throughout the world was also felt in Puerto Rico. Since the island's economy was and still is dependent to that of the United States, it was to be expected that when the American banks and industries began to fail the effect would be felt in the island. Unemployment was on the rise as a consequence and therefore, many families fled to the mainland U.S.A. in search of jobs.<ref>[http://www.greatdepressionsbook.com Great Depressions of the Twentieth Century, edited by T. J. Kehoe and E. C. Prescott]</ref>

The outbreak of World War II, opened the doors to many of the migrants who were searching for jobs. Since a large portion of the male population of the U.S. was sent to war, there was a sudden need of manpower to fulfill the jobs left behind. Puerto Ricans, both male and female, found themselves employed in factories and ship docks, producing both domestic and warfare goods.<ref name="LW">"LAS WACS"-Participacion de la Mujer Boricua en la Seginda Guerra Mundial; by: Carmen Garcia Rosado; page 60; 1ra.

The advent of air travel provided Puerto Ricans with an affordable and faster way of travel to New York. Eventually some Puerto Ricans adopted the mainland United States as their home and married with non-Hispanics. Thier children were of Puerto Rican decesent who were inscribed with non-Hispanic surnames.<ref name="LW"/>
