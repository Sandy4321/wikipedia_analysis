The '''Short S.27''' and its derivates, the '''Short Improved S.27 series''', were important early British aircraft used by the [[Royal Navy]] and its first air arm, the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] (RNAS). The S.27 and Improved S.27 were used for training of the Royal Navy{{<U+2019>}}s first pilots as well as in early naval aviation experiments. An Improved S.27 airplane bearing [[Admiralty]] number 38, widely but incorrectly referred to the '''Short S.38''', became famous for achieving a number of aviation firsts over a period of several months in 1911 and 1912. 

==Design==
===S.27===
The airplane bearing the [[Short Brothers]] number 27 first appeared in 1910, and became known as the "Short S.27." It was a [[biplane]] built to a [[box kite]] design, with a [[monoplane]] [[Empennage|tail]] and an [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] mounted on booms forward of the [[wing]]s. It had a single eight-[[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] [[E.N.V.]] [[Aircraft engine|engine]] and a single [[propeller]] mounted in a [[pusher configuration]].<ref>Thetford, p. 453.</ref>

===Improved S.27 series===

[[Image:Short S.27 Longmore.JPG|300px|thumb|right|The Improved S.27 No. 38<U+2014>often later called the "Short S.38"<U+2014>on 1 December 1911 just after [[Lieutenant]] [[Arthur Longmore]] (1885-1970), in dark coat walking toward the camera at right, used it to land on the [[River Medway]] off [[Sheerness]] to become the first person in the [[United Kingdom]] to take off from land and make a successful water landing.]]

The S.27{{'}}s design served as the basis of various Short aircraft which followed. They differed from the S.27 in having [[strut]]-braced extensions to their upper wings, making their upper [[wingspan]] 12 feet 3 inches (3.73 meters) wider than that of the S.27. Their powerplant also differed from that of the S.27; each mounted a 50- or 70-horsepower (37- or 52-kilowatt) [[Gnome et Rh<U+00F4>ne|Gnome]] [[rotary engine]]. At least one of them had a [[nacelle]] for the pilot and passenger.<ref>Thetford, p. 454</ref>

Much confusion exists over the identities and proper designations of these modified S.27s because each of them received multiple, uncoordinated identification numbers under various numbering systems. Each received a Short company number, which sometimes changed in an aircraft that underwent extensive reconstruction; some owned by [[Frank McClean]] and employed by the RNAS for pilot training also received a number from McClean himself; some which received one or both of these numbers also received an [[Admiralty]] number in 1911; and some which received various combinations of these numbers also received a number under the standard British numbering system adopted late in 1912. More confusing, aviation observers and writers of the time sometimes used the same "S" designation for two different aircraft which coincidentally shared a number under these differing systems even though the aircraft were of different design. Adding to the problem of the identification of the aircraft has been the loss of some early Short company records. What is clear, however, is that the modified S.27 aircraft all shared the increased upper wingspan and that all were referred to as "Improved Short S.27 series" aircraft, and "Improved Short S.27" appears to be the most consistent and least confusing way refer them even though some have since been referred by numbers such as "S.34" and "S.38."<ref>Bruce, p. 922; Donald, p. 830</ref>

Further confusion has arisen in later years as Short aircraft of later decades numbered with "S" numbers under the standard British numbering system received "S" numbers identical to those unofficially ascribed to the early Short biplanes, including Improved S.27s.

==Operational history==

The three streamlined air bags used for flotation during No. 38{{'}}s 1 December 1911 water landing are clearly visible.</center>]]

After the S.27 appeared in 1910, [[Cecil Grace]] flew it with distinction, notably at the [[Midland Aero Club]]{{'}}s meeting at [[Dunstall Park]], [[Wolverhampton]], between 27 June and 2 July 1910. Frank McClean also purchased S.27 and Improved S.27 aircraft for private use.<ref>Bruce, p. 921.</ref> 

In early 1911, McClean loaned two of his biplanes to the Royal Navy for use at [[RNAS Eastchurch|Eastchurch]] in training its first four pilots, and the aircraft probably were an S.27 and an Improved S.27. The pilots<U+2014>[[Lieutenant]]s [[Charles Rumney Samson|Charles R. Samson]] (1883-1931), R. Gregory, and [[Arthur Longmore|Arthur M. Longmore]] (1885-1970) of the Royal Navy and Lieutenant [[Eugene Gerrard|E. L. Gerrard]] of the [[Royal Marine Light Infantry]]<U+2014>reported for flight training at [[RAF Eastchurch|Eastchurch airfield]] on 1 March 1911 and earned their wings in six weeks. In October 1911, the Royal Navy purchased the two aircraft and established the Naval Flying School, Eastchurch, at Eastchurch airfield.<ref>Bruce, p. 922.</ref> 

Besides training, S.27 and Improved S.27 aircraft also were used in various early naval aviation experiments. The most famous S.27 was one of the two belonging to the Naval Flying School, Eastchurch,<ref>Donald, p. 830</ref> an Improved S.27 assigned the Admiralty number 38<U+2014>and since often referred to as the <U+201C>Short S.38,<U+201D> although that was not its official designation in the standard British numbering system established in 1912 and a later aircraft design properly was the Short S.38. Improved S.27 No. 38 achieved a number of aviation firsts over a period of a few months in 1911 and 1912.

In 1911, Lieutenant Longmore worked with [[Oswald Short]] of Short Brothers to install streamlined air bags on the [[undercarriage]] struts and under the tail of Improved S.27 No. 38 to provide flotation for a water landing. On 1 December 1911, Longmore used No. 38 to become the first person in the [[United Kingdom]] to take off from land and make a successful water landing when he landed in the [[River Medway]] off [[Sheerness]], after which No. 38 was brought ashore and flown back to Eastchurch. A flying-off ramp was constructed over the foredeck and forward 12-inch (305-mm) gun turret of the [[battleship]] [[HMS Africa (1905)|HMS ''Africa'']], and on 10 January 1912 off Sheerness now-Commander Samson, piloting No. 38, used the ramp to make the United Kingdom{{<U+2019>}}s first successful airplane take-off from a ship.  The ramp was transferred to the battleship [[HMS Hibernia (1905)|HMS ''Hibernia'']], and Samson flew No. 38 off it while ''Hibernia'' was making 10<U+00BD> [[Knot (speed)|knots]] (19&nbsp;km/h)<ref>Bruce, p. 922, states that ''Hibernia'' was making 15 knots (28 km/hr) at the time of Samson{{'}}s take-off, but other sources agree on 10<U+00BD> knots.</ref> in [[Weymouth Bay]] at the [[Royal Fleet Review]]<U+2014>during which [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] witnessed a number of flights at [[Portland, England|Portland]] over a period of four days<U+2014>in early May 1912. Sources differ on whether the date of the flight was 2 May,<ref>Burt, p. 257.</ref> 4 May,<ref>''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906-1921'', p. 9.</ref> or 9 May 1912,<ref>Thetford, p. 454.</ref> but regardless it was the world{{<U+2019>}}s first launch of an airplane from a moving ship..<ref>Burt, p. 257</ref> After the ramp was again transferred, this time to the battleship [[HMS London (1899)|HMS ''London'']], Samson repeated the feat, flying No. 38 off of ''London'' while she was underway on 4 July 1912. After the standard British numbering system was adopted later in 1912, No. 38 received the designation "RNAS No. 2."<ref>Bruce, p. 922.</ref>
