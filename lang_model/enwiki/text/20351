'''''Thirteenth Step''''' is the second studio album by American [[rock music|rock]] band [[A Perfect Circle]], released on September 16, 2003. The album sold well, charting at the number 2 position on the [[Billboard 200]] in its premiere week, selling over 231,000 copies and staying on the charts for 78 weeks.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=a perfect circle|chart=all}} Billboard.com]</ref> The album went on to be certified it as gold on November 4, 2003 and as platinum on March 24, 2006 by the [[RIAA]]. Three singles were released from the album, "[[Weak and Powerless]]", which topped both the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] and [[Modern Rock Tracks]],  followed by "[[The Outsider (A Perfect Circle song)|The Outsider]]" and "[[Blue (A Perfect Circle song)|Blue]]", which also charted on the respective charts. 

==Background==
===Writing and recording===
The band's writing process was very different from that used on the band's first album, ''[[Mer de Noms]]''. With the first album, a majority of the album had already written and recorded over a long period of time by guitarist [[Billy Howerdel]], before a band had even been assembled.<ref name="lithiummagazine">http://www.lithiummagazine.com/interview-billy-howerdel-perfect-circle-april-14th-2011</ref> He had recorded it with a female vocalist in mind, but upon [[Tool (band)|Tool]] vocalist [[Maynard James Keenan]] hearing it and offering to sing for the material, the content was then quickly finalized upon adding Keenan's vocals and re-recording the drums with band member [[Josh Freese]].<ref name="lithiummagazine" /> With beginning the second album, the band found themselves starting fresh, without any material to start with, with the exception of the track "Vanishing", which  originally was intended to be on the band's first album, but Howerdel could not find the song file in the studio, having accidentally named it "test".<ref name="lithiummagazine" /> Upon finally recovering the track in 2001, it was only slightly altered for its final release, to better match the eventual sound of ''Thirteenth Step''.<ref name="lithiummagazine" />

Writing for the album started while Keenan was still touring with his other band, [[Tool (band)|Tool]], in support of their 2001album ''[[Lateralus]]''.<ref name="mtv">http://www.mtv.com/bands/a/a_perfect_circle/news_feature_030929/index2.jhtml</ref> Howerdel would write most of the music, while Keenan would write most of the lyrics.<ref>''Thirteenth Step'' album liner notes</ref> As such, Howerdel would send work in progress instrumental he would create, and Keenan would write lyrics in between shows, a process they found to be efficient, but ultimately more difficult to balance than they initially expected.<ref name="mtv" /> Keenan's work with Tool was not the only thing delaying work on the album, as progress was also hampered by other lineup changes, including guitarist [[Troy Van Leeuwen]] leaving to be a member of [[Queens of the Stone Age]], and bassist [[Paz Lenchantin]] leaving to be a member of [[Zwan]], leading to their contributions to the album being limited to only a few tracks.<ref>http://www.mtv.com/bands/a/a_perfect_circle/news_feature_030929/index3.jhtml</ref> Lenchantin would be replaced by [[Marilyn Manson]] bassist [[Jeordie White]], while Van Leeuwen would be replaced by [[Danny Lohner]] on the album and later [[James Iha]] for touring purposes, as Iha did not actually perform on the album.<ref name="allmusic">http://www.allmusic.com/album/thirteenth-step-mw0000692011</ref>

Once touring for Tool was over with, Keenan returned to the studio to work in person with the rest of the band on the album. The sessions were, as such, marked with far more collaboration, especially between Howerdel and Keenan, now that Howerdel knew who his vocalist was, and what types of ideas he'd support.<ref name="lithiummagazine" /> At times, this would cause a creative struggle between to two as well; since Keenan was involved with some of Howerdel music writing this time around, he would sometimes give more input in the music, with the two sometimes wanting to move in opposite directions.<ref name="mtv" /> Keenan, in particular, wanted to move away from the general [[hard rock]] sound of ''Mer de Noms'', feeling that taking that approach again would be "redundant".<ref>http://www.mtv.com/bands/a/a_perfect_circle/news_feature_030929/index2.jhtml#</ref> He instead pushed for a softer sound, focusing more on [[atmosphere (sound recording)|atmospherics]] and [[ambience (sound recording)|ambience]].<ref name="allmusic" />

[[Danny Lohner]] played a large part of the productions of the track "The Noose", where as "The Package" was a full-band collaboration that started with Howerdel playing the song's basic [[guitar riff]] in front of everyone.<ref name="lithiummagazine" />

===Concept and themes===
{{quotebox|I don't think the album is specifically for people who are going through recovery, although that metaphor is absolutely present. Many of the songs are sung from the perspectives of recovery: from the perspective of a person who is in denial about a loved one, and from the drug perspective itself <U+2014> the perspective of a person who is starting to realize that there is an issue, and of a person who is ready to deal with it.<ref name="mtvnews">http://www.mtv.com/bands/a/a_perfect_circle/news_feature_040122/</ref> Lyricist Maynard James Keenan on the album's concept.|width=20%|align=right}} 

The ''Thirteenth Step'' is a concept album about the different aspects and perspectives of [[addiction]], and the recovery from it. The album's title itself is a reference to the [[12 step]] program of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].<ref name="allmusic" /> Lead vocalist and primary lyricist of the band [[Maynard James Keenan]] explained the concept on the band's [[DVD]] ''[[Amotion]]'', stating:
<blockquote>"The songs on ''Thirteenth Step'' for the most part are about the various processes of addiction, behavioral addictions, chemical addictions, and each song is kind of sung from a different perspective. I've a lot of friends who've gone through a lot of these situations. Some of the songs are sung from the perspective of the actual drug, from the perspective of someone who has realized that they have an issue or a problem, also from the perspective of a person who realizes that if they don't do something they're going to die, a song from the perspective of a person who is in denial about a loved one, dying right before their eyes. And in the case of "The Outsider", it's sung from the perspective of a person who doesn't understand at all what their friend is going through, what their loved one is going through, and they think that it's more like a sprained ankle; they can just kind of walk it off."<ref>''[[Amotion]]'', [[A Perfect Circle]], [[DVD]] commentary</ref></blockquote>

Keenan, not having struggled with addiction first-hand, drew from experiencing it happen to others around him, such as [[Layne Staley]], the lead singer of [[Alice in Chains]], who passed away in 2002 due to [[drug addiction]].<ref name="mtvnews" /> The song "The Package" is from the perspective of an addict, desperate for more, while "Blue" is from the perspective of someone having a difficult time dealing with the aftermath of an overdose.<ref>http://www.mtv.com/bands/a/a_perfect_circle/news_feature_030929/</ref>

"The Nurse Who Loved Me" is a cover of the song by [[Failure (band)|Failure]], originally featured on the [[1996 in music|1996]] album ''[[Fantastic Planet (album)|Fantastic Planet]]''.

==Release and promotion==
The album was released on September 16, 2003, and debuted at number 2 on the [[Billboard 200]] charts, with 231,000 copies sold.<ref name="blabbermouth">http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=85745</ref> Three singles were released from the album, "Weak and Powerless", which topped both the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] and [[Modern Rock Tracks]], "The Outsider", and "Blue.<ref name="blabbermouth" /> "Weak and Powerless" and "The Outsider" managed to crossover into mainstream pop radio formats as well, with the two charting at number 61 and 79 respectively on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] charts. The album was certified platinum by the [[RIAA]] in early 2006.<ref>http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=51138</ref>

The band toured extensively for the rest of 2003 and in early 2004 in support of the album. Just prior to the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential Election]], the band released ''[[Emotive (album)|Emotive]]'', a collection of political war [[cover version|cover songs]], which contained "[[Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums]]", which was a reinterpretation of the track "Pet", and a remix album titled ''[[Amotion]]'', which contained remixed versions of the tracks across their three albums, including the three singles from ''Thirteenth Step''.
