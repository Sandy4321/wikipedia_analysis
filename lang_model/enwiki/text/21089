[[Andrew Gower]] created ''DeviousMUD'', which was the forerunner to ''RuneScape'', in [[1998]]. On [[January 4]] [[2001]], ''RuneScape'' was released to the public. Since its release, the game has been praised for its [[Free-to-play|free-playing]] abilities and its availability on a web browser. As of December 2003, ''RuneScape'' has been rated as one of the fastest growing out of all of the [[MMORPG|MMORPGs]].

== History and development ==
[[Image:DeviousMUD2.PNG|thumb|right|256px|A [[screenshot]] of '''DeviousMUD''', the forerunner to ''RuneScape'', which was never released to the public.]]

''DeviousMUD'', the forerunner to ''RuneScape'', was created in 1998 by [[Andrew Gower]]. The game, which was never publicly released, used [[isometric projection|isometric graphics]]. In 1999, Gower completely rewrote the game, albeit with no improvements to the graphics or several other aspects of the game. This version was released as a public [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta]] version for approximately one week before it was withdrawn.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://deviousmud.tripod.com/|title= DeviousMUD|accessdate = 2006-09-11 |accessmonthday= |accessyear= |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= 2006|month= |format= |work= |publisher= DeviousMUD.tripod.com|pages= |language=English |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}</ref>

As a [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] undergraduate, Gower worked on a complete rewrite of the game with the assistance of his brother, Paul Gower.<ref name="ProquestGower">Dodson, Sean. "[http://technology.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,1103882,00.html Life: Online: Rune to move: A modest, Cambridge-based company has taken on the giants and developed a popular online role-playing game]." ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Manchester]], [[UK]] [[11 December]] [[2003]].</ref> The isometric view was replaced by a mixture of both [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] and [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]]. The game, renamed ''RuneScape'', was released to the public as a [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta]] version on [[4 January]] [[2001]],<ref name="WhatisJagex">{{cite web|url= http://kbase.runescape.com/viewarticle.ws?article_id=2449|title= What is Jagex?|accessdate= |accessmonthday= 2006-09-10|accessyear= |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= 2006|month= |format= |work=RuneScape Knowledge Base |publisher= Jagex|pages= |language= English|archiveurl= |archivedate=}}</ref> and was originally operated from their parents' house in Nottingham.<ref name="ProquestGower"/> In [[December]] [[2001]], the Gower brothers and Constant Tedder formed [[Jagex]] to take over the business aspects of running ''RuneScape''.<ref name="WhatisJagex"/>

On [[27 February]] [[2002]], a membership service was made available, allowing players who choose to pay a monthly fee to access a variety of additional features including new areas, quests, and items. This service significantly changed the focus of the game.

[[Image:RuneScape_classic.JPG|frame|left|A screenshot of ''RuneScape Classic''.]]

As the game became more and more popular, Jagex began planning major changes to the game. Although initially only a graphical update was planned,<ref>[http://news.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/newsitem.ws?id=64 "The biggest update ever..."] - ''RuneScape Game Updates News'', [[13 February]] [[2003]]. Retrieved [[15 June]] [[2006]].</ref> the developers opted instead to completely rewrite the game engine, introducing a version that consisted entirely of three-dimensional graphics, with other significant improvements. While in development, this version was known as ''RuneScape 2''. A beta version of the new engine was made available to paying members on [[1 December]] [[2003]], and the finished version was launched on [[29 March]] [[2004]].<ref>[http://news.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/list.ws?cat=1&page=8 RS2 Launched] - ''RuneScape'' Game Updates News. Retrieved [[30 July]] [[2006]]</ref> Upon release, ''RuneScape 2'' was renamed ''RuneScape'', and the older version of the game was kept online as ''RuneScape Classic''. ''RuneScape Classic'' was restricted to paying members who had recently logged in to the ''Classic'' servers on [[12 January]] [[2006]], due to persistent cheating.<ref name="classic_restrict">[http://news.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/newsitem.ws?id=531 "Nearly 5000 RS-classic accounts banned"] - ''RuneScape'' Customer Support News, [[12 January]] [[2006]]. Retrieved [[4 March]] [[2006]]</ref>

On [[16 May]] [[2006]], Jagex upgraded ''RuneScape's'' game engine, primarily as a back-end upgrade rather than a visible graphical boost.<ref>[http://news.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/newsitem.ws?id=584 Game engine update] - ''RuneScape'' Game Updates News. [[16 May]] [[2003]].</ref> In particular, the amount of memory required to run ''RuneScape'' was significantly reduced, allowing the game to be expanded and improved without increasing the loading time for most players. This is the current version of ''RuneScape'' being promoted by Jagex, and is the version most people now associate with the word ''RuneScape''.

=== Servers ===
[[Image:RuneScape server location map.png|thumb|right|315px|''RuneScape'' servers are located in seven countries.]]

<!-- Please don't change the number of servers unless several servers are put online or taken down. We know the exact number, but it's not really relevant, and we don't want to change it every time a server is added/removed. -->
There are about 140 <!-- READ ABOVE! --> ''RuneScape'' servers, numbered and referred to as ''worlds'' by players, located throughout the world. The servers use [[Unix]], [[Debian GNU/Linux]], and [[Cisco IOS]] software,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jagex.com/corporate/jobs.ws |title=Jobs |accessdate=2006-12-12 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Jagex]] Ltd. |pages= |language= English|archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> and they are located in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Australia]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]].<!-- The German servers are currently located in Finland; please don't add Germany. --><ref name="countries">[http://news.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/newsitem.ws?id=664 "Game-world locations renamed"]<!-- Finland -->, [http://news.runescape.com/newsitem.ws?id=596 "11 new worlds online"]<!-- Canada -->, [http://news.runescape.com/newsitem.ws?id=560 "5 new worlds in Stockholm, Sweden"]<!-- Sweden, Netherlands -->,  [http://news.runescape.com/newsitem.ws?id=527 "6 new Australian servers online!"]<!-- Australia -->, [http://news.runescape.com/newsitem.ws?id=517 "8 new worlds in Miami"]<!-- U.S. -->, and [http://news.runescape.com/newsitem.ws?id=405 "New London servers"]<!-- UK -->. ''RuneScape'' Technical News ([[26 April]] [[2005]] through [[20 November]] [[2006]]). Retrieved on [[13 April]] [[2007]].</ref> Each of the ''RuneScape'' servers allows 2,000 players to connect simultaneously, allowing a maximum capacity of approximately 280,000 players online at any given time. The servers are divided into free servers, accessible by all players, and [[#Membership|members]] servers, accessible by only those players who choose to pay a monthly fee for additional content. Unlike many other MMORPGs, ''RuneScape'' allows players to freely switch between servers. Characters are not bound to a particular server, but rather, players may use whichever server they choose.<ref name="getting_started"/>

In addition to the ''RuneScape'' servers, there are two members-only servers for ''RuneScape Classic'', both located in the United Kingdom. Each of these is limited to 1,250 players, allowing a total number of 2,500 simultaneous ''RuneScape Classic'' players. Only players who played ''RuneScape Classic'' in the six months prior to [[12 January]] [[2006]] can currently log onto the ''Classic'' servers.<ref name="classic_restrict"/>

=== Advertising ===
To support ''RuneScape's'' free content, advertisements are displayed above the playing screen on the free-player servers. On [[13 July]] [[2006]], Jagex signed an exclusive marketing and distribution contract with [[WildTangent]] Games,<ref name="wildtangent"/> which granted WildTangent the right to handle advertising in and around ''RuneScape'' in the United States. The deal also allowed WildTangent to distribute ''RuneScape'' through the WildTangent Games Network,<ref name = wildtangent /> a distribution channel, reaching over 20 million consumer PCs.<ref>{{ cite news | title = WildTangent Sells Ads in Runescape Online Game | language = English | publisher = MediaBuyerPlanner | date = 2006-07-13 | url = http://www.mediabuyerplanner.com/2006/07/13/wildtangent_sells_ads_in_runesc/ | accessdate = 2006-08-08 }}</ref> WildTangent has stressed that this agreement will not change the way ''RuneScape'' is presented, and that they plan to make the presence of the advertisements, vital to ''RuneScape'', as non-invasive as possible. Jagex moderators have stated that there will be no ''in-game'' advertisements.<ref name = wildtangent /> Since computer users may use advertisement blockers which may discourage advertisers, Jagex introduced a rule that prohibits players from blocking the advertisements in the free game.<ref>{{cite news | title = Runescape:Rules of Conduct:Rule 15-Advert Blocking | work = RuneScape Knowledge Base | language = English | publisher = Jagex | date = 2006 | url = http://kbase.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/viewarticle.ws?article_id=2396 | accessdate = 2006-08-11 }}</ref>

=== Foreign languages ===
On [[14 February]] [[2007]], Jagex released a [[German language|German]] closed beta translation of ''RuneScape''. As of [[7 March]] [[2007]], it is in a [[Software release life cycle#Beta|public beta]] stage while errors in the translation of the game and website are still being corrected. Currently, there are two German language servers online, one for each the free and members versions of ''RuneScape''.<ref name="GermanRelease">{{cite web|url= http://news.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/newsitem.ws?id=713|title= RuneScape: German Language Beta Launch|accessdate = 2007-02-14|accessmonthday= |accessyear= |author= Jagex|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= 2007|month= |format= |work= |publisher= Jagex|pages= |language= English|archiveurl= |archivedate=}}</ref><ref name="GermanOpenBeta">{{cite web|url= http://news.runescape.com/lang/de/newsitem.ws?id=707|title= Hereinspaziert - die Open Beta der deutschen Version beginnt!|accessdate = 2007-03-08|accessmonthday= |accessyear= |author= Jagex|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2007-02-07|format= |work= |publisher= Jagex|pages= |language= German|archiveurl= |archivedate=}}</ref>

== Membership ==
[[Image:Skillsp2p.PNG|thumb|left|234px|The skills interface shown while playing ''RuneScape'', with member skills outlined in blue.]]
Membership in ''RuneScape'' is an optional service that provides extensive additional content and extra features versus the free version of the game. Most quests and several skills, as well as three-fourths of the world map, are reserved for members. Members can play mini-games with unique rewards, use new items, and have access to improvements for nearly all skills. Members also receive additional storage space for their items, priority customer service, and the ability to post on the official forums. Regular game updates are usually reserved for members, save for a few updates each year that affect the free version of the game.<ref name="MemberBenefits">{{cite web|url= http://runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/members/members.ws|title= Benefits for Members|accessdate = 2006-09-17|accessmonthday= |accessyear= |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= 2006|month= |format= |work= |publisher= Jagex|pages= |language= English|archiveurl= |archivedate=}}</ref>

Monthly membership fees are currently set at <U+00A3>3.20, $5.00 US, $7.20 CDN, <U+20AC>4.60, $8.20 AUSD or $8.90 SGD, if paid for with a credit or debit card.<!--These amounts are not the applicable exchange rates - they are the actual Jagex fee charged in those currencies; there is no "approximately"; these are the exact amounts - please do not adjust them unless they are changed by Jagex--> Other payment methods are available, such as [[PayPal]], cheque or money order, or through players' telephone providers, generally at a higher price.<ref name="MemberBenefits">{{cite web|url= http://runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/members/members.ws|title= Benefits for Members|accessdate = 2006-09-17|accessmonthday= |accessyear= |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= 2006|month= |format= |work= |publisher= Jagex|pages= |language= English|archiveurl= |archivedate=}}</ref>

Members are granted access to exclusive members servers, which do not contain advertisements. Members features and content are restricted to these servers; however, members can choose to play on free servers if they wish. Members that switch between members and free servers must be standing on the free portion of the map in order to log into the free server. Members features are disabled on free servers, and members items lose any of the benefits that they may provide. Logging back into a members server restores these benefits.

It has been announced that membership benefits on the [[Software release life cycle#Beta|public beta]] [[#Foreign Languages|German website and game]] will carry over to the English version, and vice-versa.<ref name="GermanOpenBeta"/>

== Gameplay ==
New players begin in a secluded area populated only by other beginners, [[RuneScape locations#Tutorial Island|Tutorial Island]].<ref name="getting_started">{{cite web |url= http://kbase.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/viewarticle.ws?article_id=2058|title=How do I get started? |accessdate = 2007-01-28|author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= 2006|month= |format= |work=RuneScape Knowledge Base |publisher= Jagex|pages= |language=English |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> They are led on a set path where they learn most of the skills needed to succeed in Gielinor, the land of RuneScape. After completing the tutorial, players can access information from tutors located in the towns they explore. These non-player characters, or [[Non-player character|NPCs]], can replace some basic equipment items if necessary. Since it takes many hours to develop a character, many players regard playing ''RuneScape'' as a lifestyle, not a side activity.

''RuneScape'' has music, sound effects, and ambient noises throughout Gielinor to enhance gameplay. The music is designed to enhance mood and help to define the underlying cultures of the various locations around Gielinor. Sound effects, such as the "sploosh" heard when a lobster trap is submerged in water, are heard as players train their skills. Ambient noises, such as the cry of seagulls flying over the ocean, occur in logical places. Players can adjust the volumes of the music, sound effects, and ambient noises independently of each other.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gamersinfo.net/index.php?art/id:390|title= RuneScape|accessdate = 2006-08-10|accessmonthday= |accessyear= |author= Cloud8976 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= 2005-03-30|year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= GamersInfo |pages= |language= English |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}</ref>

=== Graphics ===
''RuneScape'' can be run with high or low-detail graphics; high-detail mode enhances texture and design, whereas low-detail provides a cleaner look and can reduce [[lag]] on older or less powerful computers. In February 2005, Jagex began the process of updating the graphical images in the ''RuneScape'' cities and the wilderness, planning ultimately to improve the graphics of the entire free area of ''RuneScape'' without causing more lag for people using [[dial-up access|dial-up]] Internet connections.<ref>[http://news.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/newsitem.ws?id=363 "Wilderness Capes, and Changes"] ''RuneScape'' Game Updates News, [[22 February]] [[2006]]. Retrieved [[31 July]] [[2006]].</ref>

''RuneScape'' places emphasis on granting players the ability to customise their characters by supplying a wide choice in character models. Unlike many games in the genre, player characters must be human; however, players can choose their appearance from a wide range of hairstyles, body types, facial features, clothing options, and gender.<ref name="getting_started"/>
On-screen appearance is further optimised by wearing or wielding items, with each different item having a unique image. Standard weapons of the same class, such as swords, use the same set of animations in combat; however, some special weapons have their own, distinctive animations that differ completely from those of other weapons in their category.

A player's appearance can be radically changed with special equipment and during particular events. Players can be transformed by game characters or their surroundings into frogs, mushrooms, or small animals. Players using certain items can transform themselves into piles of stone, eggs, penguins or monkeys, allowing them to avoid negative effects or gaining them access to otherwise unreachable places. Such "morphs" are temporary, and players cannot perform certain activities that normally can be done in human form.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://runescape.salmoneus.net/easter_2006.html |title=Easter 2006 Event |accessdate=2007-03-05 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=2007 |month= |format= |work= |publisher= Sal's Realm of RuneScape|pages= |language=English |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

Each activity performed by a player, from walking down a city street to planting a seed in a [[RuneScape skills#Extracting|farming]] plot, has its own distinctive animation. Players can also express emotions whenever they choose through the use of emotes. New players start with most of the available emotes, but others must be earned from quests, random events, or holiday events.

=== Skills ===
{{main|RuneScape skills}}
[[Image:Runescapemining.JPG|thumb|275px|left|A player collects [[coal]] using the mining skill.]]

Skills in ''RuneScape'' are the abilities that enable players to perform activities in the game. Players gain experience in a skill when they perform activities that utilise that skill, such as mining ore from a rock to increase the mining skill. In general, the higher the level required to perform a task, the more [[experience points]] the player receives, and the more desirable the result. The total skill level of a player partly symbolises the player's status in the game. The ''RuneScape'' hiscore tables can be viewed by all players, and players with higher overall levels are well known within the RuneScape community. Upon reaching the highest available level in a skill, players may obtain a special [[cape]], which can be used to perform an [[emoticon|emote]] related to that skill.

''RuneScape'' has twenty-three trainable skills in four categories. Combat consists of attack, strength, defence, magic, ranged, prayer, and hitpoints. The extraction skills, which allow players to gather resources, include mining, fishing, woodcutting, thieving, and farming. The processing skills, which allow players to process resources into usable items, include smithing, cooking, crafting, runecrafting, fletching, and herblore. The independent skills include firemaking<!--Maybe this should be a processing skill?-->, agility, construction, slayer, and hunter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kbase.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/viewcategory.ws?cat_id=776 |title=Skills |accessdate = 2006-10-14 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=2006 |month= |format= |work=RuneScape Knowledge Base|publisher= Jagex |pages= |language=English |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/newsitem.ws?id=656 |title=Behind the Scenes - November |accessdate = 2006-11-04 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=2006 |month= |format= |work=RuneScape News|publisher= Jagex |pages= |language=English |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

=== Combat ===
[[Image:Runescape weapons specialattacks darklight-weaken.gif|right|frame|A player and an NPC engage in combat.]]
{{main|RuneScape combat}}

Combat is an important aspect of the gameplay in ''RuneScape'', as it is one of the most direct ways of gaining wealth and is needed to start and complete many quests. Combat level, determined by applying a formula to the seven combat skills, is usually referred to simply as "level". Combat level is the only information about the player that is visible to other players while in game. Other skill levels increase total levels and overall rankings for players, but not their combat levels.<ref name="FightingBasics">{{cite web |url= http://kbase.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/viewarticle.ws?article_id=1945|title= Fighting - The Basics|accessdate = 2006-10-09 |date= |year=2006 |work=RuneScape Knowledge Base |publisher=Jagex |language= English}}</ref>

Combat is subdivided into melee, magic, and ranged categories. Melee attacks are close range with or without weapons,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kbase.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/viewarticle.ws?article_id=2349 |title=Melee - The Basics |accessdate = 2006-10-14 |date= |year=2006 |work=RuneScape Knowledge Base |publisher=Jagex |language=English}}</ref> magic attacks focus on using runestones to cast spells,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kbase.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/viewarticle.ws?article_id=1901|title=Magic - The Basics |accessdate = 2006-10-14 |date= |year=2006 |work= RuneScape Knowledge Base|publisher= Jagex |language=English}}</ref> and ranged moves use projectile weapons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kbase.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/viewarticle.ws?article_id=1962 |title=Ranged - The Basics |accessdate = 2006-10-14 |date= |year=2006 |work= RuneScape Knowledge Base |publisher= Jagex |language= English}}</ref> Most of the game's weapons are medieval or fantastical in nature and feature different strengths and weaknesses.

Players die when they receive enough damage from combat, poison, or obstacles to cause their hitpoints to fall to zero. Players who die reappear at one of two respawn points (the town of Lumbridge by default, though members may change to the city of Falador upon completion of a quest) with all their skills, including hitpoints, restored to normal levels; however, they lose all but three most valuable items that they were carrying at the time of death.<ref name="FightingBasics"/>

Unlike most games in the MMORPG genre, ''RuneScape'' does not require players to choose a character class. Players are not bound to a specific category of combat, and they may freely change between the three styles of combat at any time simply by switching weapons, armours, or the form and focus of attack. Players can carry the weapons and armours of the three combat categories in their inventories, switching between or even combining the styles at will.

=== Quests ===
[[Quest (gaming)|Quests]] are tasks that players may complete in order to receive rewards, often including access to new items and areas. Quests often require minimum levels in certain skills or a minimum combat level to complete them, and a few require the help of another player. Quests are grouped into four categories based on requirements and difficulty. Novice quests effectively act as extended tutorials for new players. Intermediate quests are designed to act as new obstacles on a relatively basic level, while experienced and master quests aim to challenge the more experienced players. Many master quests open up new areas of Gielinor for players to explore. Once a player completes all quests in the game, a quest cape can be purchased from an NPC. Wearing this cape allows the player to perform a special emote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kbase.runescape.com/viewarticle.ws?article_id=2312 |title=Beginners' Guide |publisher=Jagex |work=RuneScape Knowledge Base |accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref><ref>[http://kbase.runescape.com/viewarticle.ws?article_id=2871 Capes of Accomplishment]. ''RuneScape Knowledge Base''. Jagex. Retrieved [[27 March]] [[2007]].</ref>

Upon completing quests, players receive rewards that vary depending on the difficulty of the quest. Rewards often include coins, items, access to a new area, or an increase in skill experience. Quest points are also awarded for completing quests, the amount of which varies from quest to quest. Some quests require the player to have a specified number of quest points or to have previously completed certain quests before beginning the quest. Many quests are part of overlapping storylines that become more difficult as the player progresses through them. The longest of these has been in ''RuneScape'' since 2002<ref> [http://news.runescape.com/newsitem.ws?id=29 "Multi-part quest"] - ''RuneScape'' Game Update News, [[27 August]] [[2002]]. Retrieved [[18 March]] [[2007]].</ref> and currently contains several separate quests.<ref name="questlist">''RuneScape'' Quest List -  [http://kbase.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/viewcategory.ws?cat_id=817 A-M] and [http://kbase.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/viewcategory.ws?cat_id=818 N-Z].

=== Interaction ===
Many NPCs populate the realm of Gielinor. Although some NPCs, such as shopkeepers, have game functions that require them to be unavailable for combat, most NPCs can be attacked. Attackable NPCs are generally referred to as [[monsters]], regardless of their race. Monsters range from common, low level creatures like chickens and bears to unique, much more powerful monsters like the King Black Dragon, Chaos Elemental, or Kalphite Queen. Each type of monster has its own strengths and weaknesses. [[Demons]], for example, have low defence against magical attacks while most dragons have extremely high defence against magic. Monsters may also be aggressive, attacking any player who comes within range regardless of the player's combat level, non-aggressive, meaning the monster only attacks when provoked, or partially aggressive, only attacking players below a certain level. This can make certain areas throughout Gielinor dangerous or inconvenient to players depending upon their combat levels.<ref>[http://tip.it/runescape/index.php?page=how_to_bestiary.htm "How to use the Bestiary"] Tip.It, [[22 March]] [[2007]].

''RuneScape'' features independent mini-games for its players. Mini-games take place in certain areas and normally involve a specific skill. Mini-games usually require players to cooperate or to compete with each other. Popular mini-games include ''Castle Wars'', which is similar to the real-life game [[Capture the Flag]], and ''Pest Control'', a highly combat-focused mini-game. Currently, mini-games are only available to paying [[#Membership|members]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://runescape.salmoneus.net/mini_games.html|title= mini-Games & Mini-Quests|accessdate = 2006-10-09|author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= 2006|month= |format= |work= |publisher= Sal's Realm of RuneScape|pages= |language= English|archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

Players can fight against other players in [[player versus player]] (PvP) combat in certain areas of Gielinor. The most common place is in the [[Wilderness (RuneScape)|Wilderness]], where players risk their lives and their items fighting other players.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://runescape.salmoneus.net/wildy_survival.html|title= Wilderness Survival Guide|accessdate = 2006-10-09 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=2006 |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Sal's Realm of RuneScape |pages= |language= English|archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> Players can engage in PvP combat without risking their items in mini-games such as the Duel Arena, Castle Wars, and the TzHaar Fight Pits, and in combat arenas or dungeons in player owned houses. Players engaging in PvP combat in the Duel Arena can agree on rules for the duel such as allowing only melee attacks or preventing players from using potions during the fight.

=== Random events ===
Random events are short interludes that occur during the game, requiring some form of player input. They were introduced to deter players from using automated programs, known as [[macro]]s, autoers, or [[Internet bot|bots]], to play the game with no human interaction. The use of such macros is explicitly forbidden and can result in the permanent ban of accounts found to be using them. Postings in the ''RuneScape'' forums by Andrew Gower suggest that random events were designed not only to hinder macroers but to alleviate the monotony that can occur while levelling skills for long periods of time (referred to as [[Grind (gaming)|grinding]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tip.it/runescape/?page=random_events.htm |title= Random Events Guide|accessdate = 2006-10-14 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= 2006-07-13|year=|month= |format= |work= |publisher= RuneScape Tips|pages= |language=English |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=}}</ref>

Some random events are simple, requiring a player only to click on an [[Non-player character|NPC]] or to leave the area temporarily; others require more sophisticated actions from players, who must respond to these events quickly and correctly to avoid a negative effect, such as being [[Teleportation|teleported]] across the map or taking damage. Players are usually rewarded for responding correctly to random events.<ref name=Salmoneus_link> {{cite web |url= http://runescape.salmoneus.net/random_events.html|title= Random Events|accessdate = 2006-10-14 |author= Salmoneus|authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=2006 |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Sal's Realm of RuneScape |pages= |language=English |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref>

Two random events have been removed from the game by Jagex. The tangle vine was removed almost immediately after being introduced as it was deemed too dangerous to players, but was reintroduced as part of the [[RuneScape skills#Independent|construction skill]] for player-owned houses.<ref name=Salmoneus_link/> The Dr. Ford event was removed for causing graphical problems within the game program.<ref> {{cite web |url= http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=random_events.htm#removed|title= Random Events|accessdate = 2006-11-19 |author= Eeeeediot|authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=2006 |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Tip.it |pages= |language=English |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

== Community ==
''RuneScape'' players represent a wide range of nationalities and ages. Most players speak English to some extent. Players who speak languages other than English tend to gravitate to servers populated by  other players who speak the same language; some worlds have larger numbers of players who speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], or other languages. It is not uncommon, however, to see many languages on the chat screen throughout ''RuneScape''. A [[#Foreign languages|German translation]] of ''RuneScape'' has recently been released as an open [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta]].<ref name="GermanRelease"/><ref name="GermanOpenBeta"/>

A set of official [[Internet forum|forums]] created entirely by Jagex programmers is available to players on the ''RuneScape'' website. On the forums, players are able to participate in game discussions, play player-made forum games, make arrangements to buy or sell items, and interact with the community. Free players can read the forums, but posting on them is reserved for paying [[#Membership|members]]. The ''RuneScape'' forums are quite diverse, allowing thousands of players to access them at any given time. Each forum has its own specific list of rules enforced by [[forum moderators]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/codeofconduct.ws |title=RuneScape Forums: Code of Conduct |accessdate = 2006-10-14|author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=2006 |month= |format= |work=RuneScape Forums |publisher=Jagex |pages= |language=English |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

Players can submit questions to any [[non-player character]] in the game. Selected letters are answered in an update called ''Postbag from the Hedge'', typically at the end of each month. This feature began on [[26 September]] [[2005]] and has since become one of the most accessed pages of the site. From [[24 September]] [[2002]] through [[9 December]] [[2004]], players could submit questions to the [[RuneScape gods|''RuneScape'' gods]], however this feature has been discontinued.<ref>[http://www.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/varrock/letters/lettersindex.ws Letter Archives] - Jagex. Retrieved [[31 July]] [[2006]].</ref> Players can also submit original ''RuneScape'' related artwork, some of which is displayed in a gallery on the ''RuneScape'' website. Media featured have included sculpture, comics, drawings, and paintings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/varrock/letters/lettersindex.ws|title=Letter and Picture Archives (The Players' Gallery)|accessdate=2007-02-25|publisher=Jagex|language=English}}</ref>

Many ''RuneScape'' [[fansites]] have been established by players, none of which are supported or recognized by Jagex. In order to provide players with an alternative, official site to get the information they want or need, Jagex introduced the Knowledge Base,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/newsitem.ws?id=556|title=New Improved Game Guide Released! |accessdate = 2006|author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= 2006-03-13|year= |month= |format= |work= RuneScape Website News|publisher=Jagex |pages= |language=English |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> which offers information on gameplay, the main ''RuneScape'' rules, and account security.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://kbase.runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/index.ws|title=Welcome to the RuneScape Knowledge Base |accessdate = 2007|author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= 2007-01-23|year= |month= |format= |work= RuneScape Website|publisher=Jagex |pages= |language=English |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

== Reception ==
A study by [[Brunel University]] claims that playing ''RuneScape'', in some ways, can be beneficial to players. It can instruct players about working hard to achieve goals and that the nature of most games, including ''RuneScape'', can teach teenagers vital skills as they enter the labour market.<ref name="bbcallworknoplay">{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = How gaming is all work and no play | work = | pages = | language = English | publisher = BBC News | date = 2006-03-14 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4774534.stm | accessdate = 2006-08-07 }}</ref> As of December 2003, ''RuneScape'' was one of the fastest growing out of all of the [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]]s, having a userbase fifty percent larger than that of [[EverQuest]].<ref name="Guardianrunetomove">{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Rune to move. | work = | pages = | language = English | publisher = Guardian Unlimited | date = 2003-12-11 | url = http://technology.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,1103882,00.html | accessdate = 2006-08-08}}</ref> The game is praised for its free play abilities. JustRPG summarised the game with "In short, the game of Runescape is a fun, addictive game, and while the graphics may not be perfect, for a game written in Java, they aren't bad. The [[RuneScape skills|skills]] are varied, the community is alright, and it'll eat up your time if you aren't careful," giving it a score of 83%.<ref>{{cite news | last = Gasperazzo | first = Wendy | coauthors = | title = Runescape | work = | pages = | language = English | publisher = Just RPG}}</ref> The [[Yahoo!|Yahoo]] Buzz Log states that "while it may not be as easy on the eyes as some other popular online RPG games, like ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', ''[[City of Heroes]]'', or ''EverQuest'', RuneScape is still a lot better way to kill time than pushing around cells in a [[spreadsheet]]."<ref>{{cite news | last = Hurd | first = Gordon | coauthors = | title = The Rundown on Runescape | work = | pages = | language = English | publisher = Yahoo Buzz Log | date = 2006-05-08 | url = http://buzz.yahoo.com/buzzlog/9096/the-rundown-o-runescape| accessdate = 2006-08-08 }}</ref> [[PC Gamer]] UK in December 2003; states that while the "traditional [[Role-playing game|RPG]] values of [[quest]]ing, slaying [[monster]]s and developing your character in a familiar [[Middle Ages|medieval]] setting" won't "have the big boys trembling in their +2 Boots of Subscriber Gathering," this is offset by the game's accessibility through a web browser, "compounded by a version of the game that allows free adventuring before players upgrade to a members account," describing the game as "an unsurprising success."<ref>{{cite news | last = Sutherns | first = Mark | coauthors = | title = Runescape 2: browser-based Goblin basher goes 3D. | work = [[PC Gamer]] UK, issue 129| pages = 145 | language = English | publisher = [[Future Publishing]] | date = 2003-12 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>
