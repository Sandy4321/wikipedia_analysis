In his career as a detective between 1923 and 1947, Broderick built a reputation for physical courage, for assaulting gangsters like [[Jack Diamond (gangster)|Jack "Legs" Diamond]] and [[Francis Crowley|"Two-Gun" Crowley]], and for facing down armed gunmen in a prison break at [[The Tombs]] prison.<ref name="Daily News - 1999">{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/johnny-broderick-true-detective-article-1.836073 | title=John Broderick True Detective | work=The Daily News |location=New York | date=March 12, 1999 | accessdate=21 March 2014 | author=Maeder, Jay}}</ref>

==Early life==
John Joseph Broderick was born on Manhattan's East 25th Street, in the impoverished [[Gashouse District]], the son of Margaret Kendall and Michael Broderick.<ref name="Times death notice">{{cite news|title=Death Notices: John J.

He served in the [[U.S. Navy]] in [[World War I]] and worked as a bodyguard for [[Samuel Gompers]], the labor leader. He joined the [[New York City Fire Department]] in April 1922, but found that boring.<ref name="Times obituary"/><ref name=Tribune-retirement/><ref name="Ancestry.com burial record" /> Having taken both the Fire and Police Department examinations, in January of the following year he joined the New York City Police Department.<ref name=Times-retirement/>

In their 2001 book ''NYPD'', James Lardner and Thomas A. Reppetto describe Broderick as a "Gashouse district tough guy" and "former labor slugger."<ref name="Lardner" />

==Career==
[[File:Times Square on a Rainy Day 1943 John Vachon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Times Square]] in 1943, when Johnny Broderick patrolled the area.]]
Broderick joined the NYPD on January 16, 1923, and he became a detective third grade on April 2 of that year,<ref name=Tribune-retirement/> obtaining in less than four months a promotion that would usually take five years.<ref name="Daily News - 1999"/><ref name=Times-retirement>{{cite news|title=BRODERICK PLANS POLICE RETIREMENT: 'Tough Johnny,' Famous in Bootleg Era, Signs Papers After 25 Years|accessdate=23 March 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 19, 1947|page=15}}</ref>  The ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]''  called his swift appointment as detective "extraordinary luck or influence or both." He continued to rise rapidly in rank. He was promoted to detective second grade in May 1925 and detective first grade in March 1926.<ref name="Tribune-retirement" /><ref name="promoted">{{cite news | title=8 Detectives Promoted | work=The New York Times | date=March 6, 1926 | accessdate=21 March 2014 | pages=8}}</ref> The ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' reported years later that "no few of Detective Broderick's contemporaries [felt] that he plainly had an angel somewhere in the city."<ref name="Daily News - 1999"/> In 1934 it was reported that before joining the police department he was a chauffeur for a coal merchant who was close to chief inspector William J.

Broderick was put in charge of the Industrial Squad, a plainclothes unit was created in 1917 to monitor the labor movement, to keep it free from political radicals, Communists and racketeers, and to suppress violence during strikes. Broderick "had little patience with labor militants," according to one history of the NYPD in that era, and he led the Industrial Squad in violent confrontations with the fur workers' union, which was led by Communists, and railroad workers insurgents in 1926 and 1927.<ref name=Johnson>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Marilynn S.|title=Street justice a history of police violence in New York City|year=2003|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston (Mass.)|isbn=978-0-8070-5023-1|pages=111, 151<U+2013>152, 164|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M7OrWulxDXwC&pg=PA151}}</ref> Strikes in the city's [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]] also turned violent, and in August 1925 Broderick's nose was broken when he tried to disperse a crowd of striking garment workers.<ref name="Warns">{{cite news | title=WARNS AGAINST GARMENT STRIKE: Union Head Tells Workers to Ignore Joint Committee's Walkout Scheme. | work=The New York Times | date=August 19, 1925 | accessdate=21 March 2014 | pages=13}}</ref>

In November 1926 the Gangster Squad was absorbed by the Industrial Squad, with Broderick in command.<ref name="Merger">{{cite news | title=M'LAUGHLIN ENDS GANGSTER SQUAD: Its Work Ordered Taken Over by Industrial Squad to Avoid Duplication of Duties | work=The New York Times | date=November 7, 1926 | accessdate=21 March 2014 | pages=7}}</ref> While commander of the Industrial Squad, Broderick received acclaim for his role in quelling an attempted prison break at [[The Tombs]], the Manhattan prison, on November 3, 1926. He faced down two armed convicts, one of them mobster [[Hyman Amberg]], in the Tombs yard after they had already killed two prison officials.

He remained in charge of the Gangster and Industrial Squad until 1928, when he received what ''The New York Times'' described as "lesser assignments."<ref name=Times-retirement/> After [[Fiorello LaGuardia]] became mayor in 1934, Broderick and other police officers fell out of favor for connections with the Democratic [[Tammany Hall]] political machine. In 1934, by then assigned to the Manhattan District Attorney's office, he was reduced in rank to patrolman, his pay was cut by $1000 and he was transferred to [[Long Island City]] by police commissioner [[John F. O'Ryan]].<ref name="Broderick-Harness" /> Syndicated columnist [[Westbrook Pegler]] said at the time that Broderick "has been busted and sent out to walk a beat because he has enjoyed for some years the endorsement and assistance of some of the most pernicious Tammany politicians in the city.<ref name="Pegler 1934">{{cite news|last=Pegler|first=Westbrook|title=Fair Enough|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19340209&id=UmIhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=E4gFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3793,1553856|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=February 9, 1934}}</ref>  He was reinstated as detective third grade by O'Ryan five months later after meeting with Broderick, saying that the original demotion was a result of "vague criticism regarding their political connections," and that he was viewed by his current commander as a "model cop."<ref name="Tribune - 6-1934">{{cite news | title=Johnny Broderick Back From Exile to Patrol Duty; 2-Fisted Detective May Get Job of Hunting Schultz | work=New York Herald Tribune | date=June 29, 1934 | accessdate=21 March 2014 | pages=11}}</ref> He was promoted to detective second grade in 1935 and detective first grade in 1939.<ref name="Tribune-retirement" />

On the Broadway beat, Broderick swiftly gained a reputation for violence. His fists were once described as "huge lethal pistons that could beat a man senseless in half a heartbeat," and to "broderick" became Broadway slang for being knocked out by a single punch.<ref name="Daily News - 1999"/><ref name="Broadway encyclopedia">{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ib2awFyFUKoC&pg=PT192 | title=Broadway: An Encyclopedia | publisher=Routledge | author=Bloom, Ken | authorlink=Ken Bloom | year=2003 | pages=182<U+2013>183 | isbn=978-1-135-95020-0}}</ref> His knuckles were broken many times.<ref name="Times obituary" /> Once he knocked out the gangster [[Francis Crowley|Francis "Two Gun" Crowley]] with a single punch, even though Crowley was pointing a gun at him.<ref name="Times obituary" /> He was said to have demanded that hoodlums tip their hat to him, and once was said to have gone to the funeral of a member of the [[Hudson Dusters]] gang and spat in his eye. Broderick would wrap a lead pipe in a newspaper, which allowed him to beat gangsters while it looked like he was giving them a friendly swat with a rolled-up newspaper.<ref name=Lardner/>

Broderick's exploits were widely reported in the New York media, gaining him celebrity status. His tenth anniversary on the police department was commemorated by a dinner in his honor in January 1933 at the Della Robbia room of the Vanderbilt Hotel, attended by politicians and civic leaders including Tammany Hall district leader [[James J. Hines]]. Entertainment was provided, gratis, by [[Bill Robinson]], [[Bert Lahr]] and [[Harry Richman]].<ref name="Tribune-retirement" /> Hines was subsequently convicted of racketeering for protecting Harlem [[numbers racket]]<nowiki/>s run by [[Dutch Schultz]].<ref name=May>{{cite web|last=May|first=Allan|title=Dutch Schultz: Beer Baron of the Bronx|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/schultz/aftermath_8.html|work=CrimeLibrary|accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref>

Broderick's exploits were a mainstay of the New York newspapers. He tossed hoodlums who had been bothering women through a plate-glass window, one by one, and then arrested them for malicious destruction of property, for which they were sentenced to 30 days in jail. He also disarmed a man who was robbing a crowded restaurant at [[Columbus Circle]] with two guns and a knife.<ref name="Times obituary" /><ref name="Washington Post obit" /> He once reputedly responded to a threat from gangster [[Jack Diamond (gangster)|Legs Diamond]] by emptying a trash bin over his head, and forced him to crawl away.<ref name="Daily News - 1999" /> Other accounts of the confrontation hold that Broderick dumped Diamond in the trash bin head-first,<ref name="Lardner" /> while others say that Broderick knocked out Diamond with a single blow, with one account claiming that Diamond was left unconscious for 20 minutes.<ref name="Times obituary" /><ref name="Washington Post obit" />  Broderick's reputation for toughness was such that [[Jack Dempsey]], the heavyweight boxing champion, once said of Broderick that "He's the only I wouldn't want to meet in a fight outside the ring and its rules."<ref name="Washington Post obit" />

He would offer himself as an informal protection service for crime victims, especially young women, and personally beat up offenders.<ref name=Lardner/>

Broderick worked often with Johnny Cordes, a two-time winner of the department's medal of honor,<ref name=Lardner>{{cite book|last=Lardner|first=James|title=NYPD: a city and its police|year=2001|publisher=Henry Holt and Co.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8050-6737-8|pages=213, 231<U+2013>234|edition=1st Owl books|author2=Reppetto, Thomas}}</ref> and [[Barney Ruditsky]], whose exploits inspired the 1959 TV series ''[[The Lawless Years]]''.<ref name="Rudnitsky obit">{{cite news | title=BARNEY RUDITSKY, DETECTIVE, DEAD: Partner of Broderick Gained Reputation in Prohibition | work=The New York Times | date=October 19, 1962 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=21 March 2014 | pages=31}}</ref>

Broderick was often selected as a bodyguard for visiting celebrities. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] requested that Broderick be his special bodyguard when he visited New York for the [[1936 World Series]], and he also was bodyguard for [[Marie of Romania|Queen Marie of Romania]] and [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert]] of Belgium.<ref name="Washington Post obit"/>

==Allegations of misconduct==

Throughout his career, beginning with his days in the Industrial Squad, Broderick was a subject of allegations of misconduct, and the Industrial Squad under his command was accused of violence toward strikers and corruption.<ref name="Johnson"/>  He sometimes beat up people who were totally innocent, and lawsuits and complaints of brutality were futile because of his public image, honed by favorable media coverage, and connections.<ref name=Repetto/>

In a column on Broderick's brief demotion to patrolman in 1934, Westbrook Pegler said that the demotion would do him some good, that he "was excessively tough at times and there were occasions when, pining for action, he bounced round people who were in not particular need of bouncing around." Pegler said that Broderick was selective in whom he would harass, that "there were many low characters in the city, notorious for their activity in the rackets, who were walking right past Detective Broderick on the street and in the lobby of [Madison Square] Garden, whom he did not find any occasion to bounce around." Pegler said he found that "strange."<ref name="Pegler 1934" />

In July 1926, Broderick and the Industrial Squad were accused by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of clubbing and beating striking [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company]] workers, injuring 20.

In 1927, a furriers union official, Isidor Shapiro, told a special committee of the [[American Federation of Labor]] that his union paid the police $3800 a week in bribes for protection during a 1926 strike. Union officials claimed that non-union workers were beaten while police officers "stood idly by." Shapiro claimed that the "Industrial Squad chief" was paid $100 a week and that ten men in the squad were paid $50 a week.<ref name="Shapiro claims">{{cite news|title=FUR MEN SAY POLICE GOT $3,800 A WEEK|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E16FB345E1A7A93C5A9178FD85F438285F9&action=click&module=Search&region=searchResults%231&version=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%23%2F%2522industrial%2Bsquad%2522%2Fsince1851%2Fallresults%2F2%2F|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 7, 1927|page=1}}</ref> Broderick and the other officers were clearly after an inquiry by a judge.<ref name=Repetto/><ref name="Valentine acts">{{cite news|title=Valentine Acts on Charge Reds Bribed Police|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=New York Herald Tribune|date=October 14, 1939|page=7}}</ref> The charges were revived in 1939, when

No action was taken against Broderick or the other detectives.<ref name=Repetto/>

As a mayoral candidate in 1929, [[Fiorello LaGuardia]] accused the Industrial Squad of extorting payoffs from labor and management, and that "instead of preserving order, this agency has done more to create disorder than anything else." The squad was disbanded in 1933.<ref name="Johnson"/>

In 1937, a justice of the [[New York State Supreme Court]] freed a prisoner who had been arrested for parole violation and beaten by Broderick, saying that "the police of the City of New York beat him so badly that he will be a cripple for life. I think this man has more than expiated his crime." The prisoner sustained fractures to the knee and ribs, his jaw was dislocated, and he was not given medical attention while in police custody. Broderick's superiors found no reason to discipline the detective.<ref name="Times obituary" />

==Retirement controversy==

In September 1946, Broderick was assigned to the office of Mayor [[William O'Dwyer]] in an unannounced confidential capacity, a move that many in city government found surprising. After a few months he was abruptly transferred to the Main Office Division, and in July 1947, he retired from the police department.<ref name=Times-retirement/><ref name=Assigned>{{cite news|title=Broderick Is Assigned To a Detail at City Hall|accessdate=23 March 2014|newspaper=New York Herald Tribune|date=September 5, 1946|page=22}}</ref><ref name="city hall-Times">{{cite news|title=Broderick at City Hall|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 4, 1946}}</ref>

In 1949, he sought to become a Democratic leader in the Broadway district on Manhattan's west side. One of the two incumbent district leaders Broderick was challenging, Gerald V. Murphy, accused him of having been forced out of the department for associating with gangsters. The charge was confirmed by Manhattan's District Attorney, [[Frank Hogan]], who disclosed that Broderick was forced to retire by Mayor [[William O'Dwyer]] after Hogan's office learned that in November 1946 he had accompanied a gambler and ex-convict, Ben Kaye, to [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]], where he "associated with" mobster [[Owney Madden]].<ref name="Times - 8-31-1949" /> Broderick denied the charge, conceding that he was on the same plane as Kaye but that it was a "coincidence."<ref name=Lewis>{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Milton|title=Johnny Broderick's Retirement is an Issue in District Election|newspaper=New York Herald Tribune|date=August 31, 1949|page=1}}</ref>  He admitted that he knew Madden and "every gangster in New York.

In an editorial, the ''New York Herald Tribune'' pointed out that the circumstances of Broderick's forced retirement only came to light because he was seeking a new career in politics, and that "voters may wonder how much they are really told about city government, when the Broderick incident demonstrates how discreetly a little embarrassment can be obliterated."<ref name="Tribune editorial">{{cite news|title=Johnny Broderick Again|newspaper=New York Herald Tribune|date=September 3, 1949|page=6}}</ref>

==Personal life==

At the time of his demotion in 1934 he was described as having an affluent lifestyle. Though drawing a salary of $4,000 a year, cut to $3,000 as a result of the demotion, he drove a  [[Cadillac]], dressed expensively and owned a home in [[Jackson Heights, Queens]].<ref name="Broderick-Harness" />

Broderick neither smoked nor drank and always kept in top physical condition. He was a devoted [[prizefighting]] fan, rarely missing a fight at Madison Square Garden.<ref name=Tribune-retirement>{{cite news|title=Johnny Broderick, 50, Retires After 24 Years on Police Force|newspaper=New York Herald Tribune|date=July 19, 1947|page=11}}</ref> During his days as a detective, Broderick enjoyed listening to his wife play the piano and was described by his ''[[New York Times]]'' obituary as fond of "monogrammed, cream-colored silk underwear" and that off-duty he was "the gentlest of men."<ref name="Times obituary" /> He was said to be upset by his portrayal by Robinson in ''Bullets or Ballots'' because Robinson was shown drinking and smoking.<ref name="Washington Post obit" />

After his retirement he sold his life story to [[RKO Pictures]] for $75,000, to be made into a motion picture titled "Broadway's One-Man Riot Squad."<ref name="Times - 8-31-1949"/> The film, which was to star [[Robert Ryan]], was never made, and plans to have a television series or [[Musical theatre|musical]] made about his life persisted through 1959, but did not come to pass.<ref name="Daily News - 1999"/>

He died of heart disease on his birthday at his farmhouse outside [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown, New York]], where he raised horses and dogs. He was survived by his wife, the former Marion McShea, his daughter, Marion Farinon, three sisters and nine grandchildren.<ref name="Times obituary" /> He was buried in Pine Lawn Cemetery in [[Massapequa, New York|Massapequa]], Long Island.<ref name="Times death notice"/> In 1933 it was reported that he had been married for 14 years at the time, and that he had two daughters, Margaret and Marion.<ref name="Tribune - 1933 tribute">{{cite news|title=Dinner Honors Jno.

==Legacy==

The brutal methods used by Broderick and other officers were sanctioned by the police department during their era, and praised as "fearless." Beginning in the 1960s, however, New York police sought to curb that kind of conduct. Training programs were established teaching officers to observe the civil rights of suspects and the public. By the 1980s, it was feared that the pendulum had shifted back toward brutality, as complaints of assaults by police climbed. Broderick was cited by ''The New York Times'' in 1985 as an exemplar of the old methods of policing.<ref name="Raab - 1985">{{cite news|last=Raab|first=Selwyn|title=Rising brutality complaints raise questions about New York police|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 6, 1985|authorlink=Selwyn Raab|page=1}}</ref>

At the time of his death in 1966, Walter Henning, an assistant chief inspector and a colleague of Broderick's, called him a "man of his time," and said that "under restrictions today, he'd have a difficult time doing the things he did." But during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], he said, "when these people [gangsters] went in and out of court it was like a revolving door, they had rather be locked up than to meet Johnny."<ref name="Times obituary" />

In his 2011 book ''American Police a History, 1845<U+2013>1945'', Thomas A. Reppetto, a former Chicago detective commander and ex-president of the [[Citizens Crime Commission of New York City]], said that despite his fearsome reputation Broderick was actually beaten up on several occasions. Broderick's image, he says, "rested to a great extent that Broadway show business figures relied upon him for informal protection," as well as on "rave accounts" of his career by [[Ed Sullivan]], [[Gene Fowler]], [[Toots Shor]] and others.<ref name=Repetto/>

Reppetto observed that the "real strength" of Broderick and Cordes was that they "had what the gangster did not, the legal right to use deadly force and the practical power to slug hoods on sight." <ref name=Repetto>{{cite book|last=Reppetto|first=Thomas A.|title=American Police a History, 1845<U+2013>1945|year=2011|publisher=Enigma Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1-936274-11-6|edition=2nd}}</ref>
