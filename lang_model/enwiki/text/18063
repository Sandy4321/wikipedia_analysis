"When in Rome", the opening track on ''Why Should the Fire Die?'', was chosen as the lead, and only single. The song's title alludes to the American [[proverb]] "When in [[Rome]], do as the Romans do",  and [[Chris Thile]], the song's author, said "The idea behind the song&nbsp;<U+2013> and I do love it! - is if there is something better, it's worth leaning towards just a little bit because you'll have a great time here regardless."<ref name="jambase"/> Critics commented on the song favorably, with George Graham saying that "When in Rome" has "rock energy level and some sonic manipulation, with hints of old-time [[Appalachian music]] in the [[fiddle]], while the lyrics are definitely in the rock mode."<ref>Graham, George.

The second track, "Somebody More Like You" was written by [[guitarist]] [[Sean Watkins]].

"Can't Complain", a Chris Thile-composed piece, was the fifth track on ''Why Should the Fire Die?''. According to Sean Watkins, the song was written by Thile "from the point of view of a friend".<ref name="nctimes"/> Unlike the first four songs on the album, the song received mixed reviews. ''Being There'' called it "nothing more than a generic ballad with little merit",<ref name="beingthere"/> and [[PopMatters]] said that it was a "one-too-many Thile tune about screwed-up relationships".<ref name="popmatters"/> However, some critics found it amazing; ''[[Village Voice]]'' called the song a "lushly [[arpeggio|arpeggi]]ated ballad".<ref name="villagevoice"/> The sixth track, a [[Bob Dylan]] cover, "[[Tomorrow is a Long Time]]", was the only track on the album not composed at least partially by one of the members of [[Nickel Creek]].
