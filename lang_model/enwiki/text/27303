The New York Nautical School is today called "Maritime College" and is part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system.  Present day cadets are still taught the "Riesenberg Saying" which goes like this "The sea is selective, slow at recognition of effort and aptitude but fast in the sinking of the unfit."
