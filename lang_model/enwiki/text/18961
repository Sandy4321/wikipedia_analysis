"'''My Darlin''''" is a song by American recording artist [[Miley Cyrus]] featuring rapper [[Future (rapper)|Future]] for her fourth [[studio album]] ''[[Bangerz (album)|Bangerz]]'' (2013). It was written and produced by [[Mike Will Made It]], P-Nasty and Tyler Sam Johnson; additional songwriting was provided by Future, [[Jeremih]], [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller|Jerry Leiber]], [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller|Mike Stoller]], [[Ben E. King]], and Cyrus. "My Darlin'" samples "[[Stand by Me (song)|Stand by Me]]" by Ben E. King, where a female protagonist discusses her desire to rekindle a relationship with an unenthusiastic love interest.

"My Darlin'" received generally favorable reviews from [[Music journalism|contemporary music critics]], who appreciated its production, but felt that the incorporation of [[Auto-Tune]] interfered with Cyrus' vocal delivery. It has not been released as an official single from ''Bangerz'', and has consequently failed to impact any national [[record chart]]s. Cyrus has performed the song during her ongoing [[Bangerz Tour]].

==Background and composition==
[[File:Jeremih August 2009.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jeremih (''pictured'') contributed songwriting for "My Darlin'".]]

Cyrus, [[Future (rapper)|Future]], [[Jeremih]], [[Ben E. King]], [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller|Jerry Leiber]], [[Mike Will Made It]], P-Nasty, and [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller|Mike Stoller]] co-wrote "My Darlin'"; its production was handled by Mike Will Made It, P-Nasty, and Tyler Sam Johnson. [[Stephen Hybicki]] and Tim Roberts recorded the song, which was later mixed by Jaycen Joshua with assistance from Jon Garrett, Mike Gaydusek, Ryan Kaul, and Eva Reistad.<ref name="LinerNotes">{{cite AV media notes|title=[[Bangerz]]|others=[[Miley Cyrus]]|year=2013|accessdate=October 4, 2013|accessdate=October 4, 2013|publisher=[[RCA Records]]}}</ref> It was first announced that [[Future (rapper)|Future]] would appear on Cyrus' fourth studio album ''[[Bangerz]]'' when its track listing was confirmed on September 10.

Mike Will Made It stated that he introduced Cyrus and Future when the record was nearly completed. He convinced Cyrus' label [[RCA Records]] to continue arranging additional recording sessions, during which "My Darlin'" was created; Future later expressed his approval of Cyrus' vocal abilities on the track. Cyrus and Future continued to collaborate after their initial recording sessions; he co-wrote the track "[[Love Money Party]]" for Cyrus' ''Bangerz'', while she appeared on his track "[[Real and True]]" that was originally planned to appear on his second studio album ''[[Honest (Future album)|Honest]]'' (2014).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1603762/the-producers-a-year-end-qa-with-mike-will-made-it/franchises/interview/|title=The Producers: A Year-End Q&A With Mike WiLL Made It|author=Chris DeVille|publisher=[[Stereogum]].

"My Darlin'" has been described as a "trippy duet" and a "woozy ballad" that heavily incorporates [[Auto-Tune]] production elements.<ref name="EntertainmentWeeklyReview">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20740686,00.html|title=Bangerz - Miley Cyrus|author=Nick Catucci|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=October 1, 2013|accessdate=October 1, 2013}}</ref> It was additionally noted for its inclusion of subtle elements from [[Jamaican music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iowastatedaily.com/ames247/article_e4b7a18a-3504-11e3-9ff2-0019bb2963f4.html|title=Album Review: Miley Cyrus' 'Bangerz'|author=Emily Belloma|newspaper=[[Iowa State Daily]]|publisher=The Iowa State Daily Publication Board|date=October 17, 2013|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref> Nick Catucci from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' noted that Cyrus' performance made the track a "genuine weeper", and added that Future's verses sounded particularly heavily-processed.<ref name="EntertainmentWeeklyReview"/> Lily Harrison from [[E!]] opined that "My Darlin'" detailed when "things [went] pretty sour" in Cyrus' relationship with her former fianc<U+00E9> [[Liam Hemsworth]]; she indicated that Cyrus described Hemswroth as being unsupportive of her through the lyrics "We were supposed to be together / Take me as I am or not / I can't breathe without you as mine / Oh darling stand by me."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/465041/miley-cyrus-bangerz-gets-streamed-are-these-lyrics-about-liam-hemsworth|title=Miley Cyrus' Bangerz Streams Online: Are These Lyrics About Liam Hemsworth?|author=Lily Harrison|publisher=[[E!]].

==Critical reception==
"My Darlin'" received generally favorable reviews from [[Music journalism|contemporary music critics]]. In a favorable review, Nick Catucci from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' recognized the track as one of two stand-out songs from ''Bangerz''.<ref name="EntertainmentWeeklyReview"/> Kitty Empire from ''[[The Guardian]]'' complimented the track for being one of the "more intriguing genre experiment" from the record, and called it a "pimped-up version of [[Ben E. King]]'s '[[Stand by Me (song)|Stand by Me]]'."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/03/miley-cyrus-bangerz-review|title=Miley Cyrus: Bangerz <U+2013> review|author=Caroline Sullivan|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=October 3, 2013|accessdate=October 4, 2013}}</ref> Christina Drill from Popdust complimented the track for having a "good chorus", and felt that the "drawn out synth chords" and "boom of the bassline" made for a romantic tone. However, she was ambivalent towards its implication of making a [[Celebrity sex tape|sex tape]] through the lines "We gon' make a movie, movie / And it's gon' be in 3D, 3D."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popdust.com/2013/10/02/miley-cyrus-bangerz-reviewed-my-darlin/|title=Miley Cyrus' ''Bangerz'' Reviewed: "My Darlin<U+2019>"|author=Christina Drill|publisher=Popdust|date=October 2, 2013|accessdate=April 11, 2014}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The A.V.

Alex Young from Consequence of Sound complimented Future's contributions to "My Darlin'"; he opined that his "mettle [...] morphs into one of ''Bangerz''{{'}}s best tracks", and highlighted the manner in which [[pop music]] and [[hip hop music]] should be blended.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2013/10/album-review-miley-cyrus-bangerz/|title=Album Review: Miley Cyrus <U+2013> Bangerz|author=Alex Young|publisher=Consequence of Sound|date=October 9, 2013|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Fader]]'' Naomi Zeichner distinguished "My Darlin'" as a stand-out track from the record; she opined that Cyrus rapped in a "squeaky-rubber" fashion on her earlier single "[[23 (song)|23]]", and appeared more comfortable with her delivery during the second verse of "My Darlin'". Zeichner elaborated the unintentional displaying of her vocals "may be where Miley actually sounds best", while album tracks "[[Adore You]]" and "[[FU (song)|FU]]" were conceived with the deliberate intention of highlighting her vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2013/10/09/the-best-songs-from-miley-cyrus-bangerz/#ixzz2zFzpR0Qf|title=The Best Songs from Miley Cyrus<U+2019> Bangerz|author=Naomi Zeichner|work=[[The Fader]]|publisher=Andy Cohn|date=October 9, 2013|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref> Sharing a similar sentiment, Arielle Castillo from Fusion favorably compared the track to Future's earlier collaborations with recording artists [[Ciara]], [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], and [[Miguel (singer)|Miguel]], and felt that it was significantly better than "Adore You".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fusion.net/culture/story/miley-cyrus-bangerz-track-track-analysis-measured-butt-102528|title=Miley Cyrus' 'Bangerz': A Track-By-Track Analysis Measured in Butt Shakes|author=Arielle Castillo|publisher=Fusion|date=October 8, 2013|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref> Lauren Weigle from Heavy felt that "My Darlin'" was an improvement from the tracks preceding it on ''Bangerz'', which she felt were lackluster; she added that "it isn't exactly a hit, but it's worth a listen."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heavy.com/entertainment/2013/10/bangerz-miley-cyrus-video-full-album-streaming-preview/|title=<U+2018>Bangerz<U+2019> by Miley Cyrus: The Only Review You Need to Read|author=Lauren Weigle|publisher=Heavy|date=October 1, 2013|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref>

In a satirical review of "My Darlin'", Nick Bhasin from The Shake implied that its lyrics made little sense, in which he jokingly suggested that the term "molly" referred to actress [[Molly Ringwald]] instead of the drug [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theshake.com.au/humour/my-son-explains-the-miley-cyrus-song-my-darlin-to-me/|title=My Son Explains the Miley Cyrus Song "My Darlin" to Me|author=Nick Bhasin|publisher=The Shake|date=November 20, 2013|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref> James Hughes from ''[[Slant (magazine)|Slant]]'' also expressed skepticism in its lyrical content. He commented that the lyrics "I can<U+2019>t breathe without you, without you as mine" were his personal choice for "the laziest lyric of the century", which first came to his attention in the late 2000s after [[Taylor Swift]] has risen to prominence; he noted that "the act of singing the lyric disproves its intent" in that "a singer is actually using the air in his or her heartsick lungs to express, and then dispel, this thoroughly exhausted announcement of breathlessness. The instant the line is uttered, the fallacy is exposed, and the moment deflates."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2013/10/miley_cyrus_taylor_swift_kelly_clarkson_they_ve_all_used_a_version_of_songwriting.html|title=Pop<U+2019>s Lamest Lyric|author=James Hughes|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company]]|date=October 27, 2013|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref> Maggie Spear from ''[[State Press]]'' was displeased with Cyrus' treatment of the original "Stand by Me", and felt that her rendition came across "like an echo-heavy '[[Adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]]' song layered with an Auto-Tuned version of 'Stand by Me' layered on top of it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statepress.com/2013/10/03/i-listened-to-miley-cyrus-bangerz-so-you-wouldnt-have-to/|title=I listened to Miley Cyrus' 'Bangerz' so you wouldn't have to|author=Maggie Spear|newspaper=[[State Press]]|publisher=[[Arizona State University]]|date=October 3, 2013|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref>

==Live performances==
Cyrus has performed "My Darlin'" without Future on her headlining [[Bangerz Tour]]; it was the fourth song performed during the first showing in [[Vancouver]] on February 14, 2014. The track followed Cyrus' energetic entrance with "[[SMS (Bangerz)]]", "[[4x4 (song)|4x4]]", and "[[Love Money Party]]", and marked the beginning of a more conservative, mid-tempo portion of the concert.<ref name="Idolator">{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7506015/miley-cyrus-bangerz-tour-review-setlist|title=Miley Cyrus' Demented 'Bangerz' Tour Is A Candy-Colored Thrill Ride: Opening Night Review|author=Mike Wass|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]].
