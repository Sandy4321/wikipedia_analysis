The plaster was removed from the walls, windows were replaced, a [[buttress]] was added to the south side, a new screen was erected.  A new [[bellcote]] with a spire, and the [[lychgate]] were added.  In 1985 the bellcote had to be removed.

==Architecture==

The church is built in [[shale]].  The roofs are covered in slates, with stone ridge tiles.  Its plan consists of a nave and a chancel, with a south porch and a vestry to the north of the chancel. At the east end is a stone cross [[finial]].  The east window is part of Douglas' restoration; it consists of three lights with [[ogee]] heads.<ref name=cpat/>
