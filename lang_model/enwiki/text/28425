"'''Crazy for You'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for the 1985 film ''[[Vision Quest]]''. It was released on March 2, 1985 by [[Geffen Records]] as the first single from the soundtrack album of the film. The song appears remixed on the 1990 greatest hits album ''[[The Immaculate Collection]]'' and was re-released on February 24, 1991 by [[Sire Records]] to promote the album. It was also included on the ballads compilation ''[[Something to Remember]]'' (1995) and the greatest hits compilation ''[[Celebration (Madonna album)|Celebration]]'' (2009). Producers [[Jon Peters]] and [[Peter Guber]], along with  music director [[Phil Ramone]], decided to use Madonna after listening to her previous recordings. They employed [[John Bettis]] and [[Jon Lind]] to write the song. After reading the script of the film, Bettis and Lind wrote the song about the situation in which the lead characters meet at a nightclub. Initial recording sessions did not impress Bettis and Lind, and they felt that "Crazy for You" would be dropped from the soundtrack. However, a new version was recorded which did impress them and was added to the album.

[[John Benitez|John "Jellybean" Benitez]] was the [[record producer|producer]] for the song, and it was a challenge for him, as previously he was associated with recording dance-pop songs only. Initially Warner Bros. Records did not want the song to be released as a single, since they believed that "Crazy for You" would take away the attention from Madonna's [[sophomore|sophomore release]] ''[[Like a Virgin]]''. In the end, Peters and Guber convinced Warner officials to green light the release of the single. "Crazy for You" ushered a new musical direction for Madonna, as previously she did not record any songs in the [[Ballad (music)|ballad]] genre. It features instrumentation from [[snare drum]]s, [[harp]], [[bass synthesizer]] and [[electric guitar]]. Lyrically the song talks about sexual desire between two lovers and consists of innuendos. It received positive reception from contemporary critics and scholars, and earned a [[28th Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nomination in 1986 for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]].

The song became Madonna's second number-one single on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] as well as reaching the peak position in the charts of Australia and Canada. It also reached number-two in the charts of Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, where it was released twice, once in 1985 and again in 1991. Madonna has performed "Crazy for You" in two of her concert tours <U+2013> [[The Virgin Tour]] in 1995 and the [[Re-Invention World Tour]] in 2004. The performances were included in the home video release of the tours. The song has been covered by a number of artists.

== Background ==

"Crazy for You" was written by [[John Bettis]] and [[Jon Lind]]. The [[ballad (music)|ballad]] was released as the first single from the soundtrack of the 1985 film ''[[Vision Quest]]'', a [[coming of age]] [[drama film|drama]] about a wrestler played by [[Matthew Modine]].<ref name="fred1"/> Producers [[Jon Peters]] and [[Peter Guber]], and music director [[Phil Ramone]] was aware of the then unknown Madonna, who was just signed to Sire Records. Ramone took her for dinner at his house in [[Lyric Street Records|Carolwood Records]], where she played some of her music videos. Ramone and the other Warner executives present there, were impressed by Madonna's self-possession and fishnet-crucifix style.<ref name="griffin"/> So they decided to test her voice in a New York studio. Peters was impressed with Madonna and assigned Joel Sill, an executive in charge of music at [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], to handle the recording of the two songs for the film.<ref name="griffin">{{harvnb|Griffin|Masters|1997|p=118}}</ref> Sill sent the script of the film to Bettis and Lind.<ref name="fred1">{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=606}}</ref> After going through the script, Bettis wanted to write a song about the situation, where the main characters <U+2013> a young boy and a girl boarding at a house <U+2013> dance together at a nightclub.<ref name="fred1"/> He elaborated,
<blockquote>
"We were noodling around and 'Crazy for You' was something that Jon was singing over that section of the song. It was really descriptive of the scene in the film. [...] After that, I was out on vacation out in the desert and [Sill] called and said Phil Ramone was in love with the song and wanted to cut it on [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. [Laughing] '[[Borderline (song)|Borderline]]' was out at that time and I said, 'Excuse me? This is for Madonna? Really? Can she sing a song like this?' Jon and I were surprised at the choice of artist at the time, if you want to know the truth."<ref name="fred1"/>
</blockquote>

== Recording ==

After Sill let Bettis and Lind know that Madonna was singing the song, some time elapsed before either of them heard anything from Warner Bros. Records. In between, they went to one of the recording sessions and were not impressed with the process of recording the song.<ref name="fred1"/> Bettis commented, "We went to one of the sessions, and to be honest, that particular session did not go all that well. [...] Jon and I were depressed about the way the song had come out. We heard nothing else about it and we were a little nervous that the song was going to be dropped from the picture."<ref name="fred1"/> Bettis went to England to work on the 1985 [[fantasy film]] ''[[Legend (film)|Legend]]'' with music producer [[Jerry Goldsmith]]. It was there he received a call from Lind, who informed Bettis that a new version of "Crazy for You" was recorded and was made ready for a [[single (music)|single]] release.<ref name="fred1"/> Bettis was surprised and went over to Lind's house, where he warmly received the new recorded version of the song. It had a different [[arrangement]] from the [[demo (music)|demo version]], and the arrangement was done by composer [[Rob Mounsey]] who rearranged the original track and added the background vocals. Bettis said: "We owe a big debt of gratitude to [Mounsey]. He really made a hit record out of [the song]."<ref name="fred1"/> Mounsey was introduced in the project by [[record producer]] [[John Benitez|John "Jellybean" Benitez]] who was producing "Crazy for You". Benitez was previously associated with producing dance-pop themed songs and it was the first time that he produced a ballad.<ref name="fred1"/> In [[Fred Bronson]]'s ''The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits'', Benitez commented,
<blockquote>
"The song was [[Recorded live track|recorded live]]. It was the first time that I produced a live session, as opposed to having [[synthesizers]] and [[drum machine]]s do everything. [...] I was tense because I had never done a record like this. [...] Everything I did was totally on instinct. I tried to make the song stand on its own, but at the same time work in the two scenes in which it was used in the movie."<ref name="fred1"/>
</blockquote>
Benitez also noted that "Crazy for You" was an important recording for Madonna, as the song being a ballad, was openly accepted at [[Adult contemporary music|adult contemporary radios]]. She had already charted with her singles "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]" and "[[Material Girl]]", hence Madonna wanted to prove that she can sing in a different [[genre (music)|genre]] of music.<ref name="fred1"/> However, Warner initially did not want the song to be released as a single, since the release of ''Vision Quest'' coincided with the release of Madonna's second studio album ''Like a Virgin'' and releasing "Crazy for You" would have distracted attention from the album. Warner Bros. Records chief [[Mo Ostin]] went to [[Robert A. Daly]], chairman of Warner, and requested him to pull out the Madonna tracks from the ''Vision Quest'' soundtrack.<ref name="griffin"/> Daly summoned Peters and Guber to his office and informed them that they had to let-go of the Madonna tracks. Peters protested and shouted at Daly, resulting him escaping in fright and Warner allowing "Crazy for You" to be released as a single.<ref name="griffin"/>

"Crazy for You" was a new musical direction for Madonna, as she had not recorded ballad songs before. According to author Rikky Rooksby, the song is sophisticated compared to her previous singles.<ref name="rook1"/> The [[introduction (music)|introduction]] features a melody by a [[woodwind instrument]] and an [[electric guitar]] chord, sliding from one [[motif (music)|motif]] to the other.<ref name="rook1"/> It has a [[snare drum]] on the last beat of the [[bar (music)|bar]], leading to the spacey quality to most of the verses. Other instrumentation comes from a [[harp]], a [[bass synthesizer]] and a chattering single note [[lick (music)|guitar lick]].<ref name="rook1"/> The fuller rhythm of the song does not start, until the [[chorus effect|chorus]] is reached. The turn of the melody allows Madonna's voice to stretch further on the higher notes.<ref name="rook1"/> "Crazy for You" is set in the [[time signature]] of common time, with a medium tempo of 104 [[beats per minute]]. It is set in the key of [[E major]] with Madonna's voice spanning between the high note of [[G<U+266F> (musical note)|G{{music|sharp}}<sub>4</sub>]] to the low note of [[C<U+266F> (musical note)|C{{music|sharp}}<sub>6</sub>]]. The song has a basic sequence of A<U+2013>G{{music|sharp}}<U+2013>C{{music|sharp}}m7<U+2013>G/A <U+2013> A/B as its [[chord progression]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Digital Sheet Music - Madonna - Crazy For You|work=''MusicNotes.com''|publisher=[[Alfred Publishing]]|accessdate=2010-02-02}}</ref> Unlike her previous singles, the chord sequence does not repeat itself and the chorus slowly unravels to the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of the song. Lyrically, the song talks about extreme love for one another.<ref name="rook1"/> It contains innuendos similar to [[The Crystals]]' 1963 song "[[Then He Kissed Me]]". According to scholar Dave Marsh, the lyrics talk about a state of frank sexual desire among two teenagers. He also said that the line "I'm crazy for you; Touch me once and you'll know it's true" was not ambiguous and it helped Madonna capitalize on such disambiguation.<ref name="marsh"/>

== Critical reception ==

Rikky Rooksby, author of ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna'', called the song sophisticated.<ref name="rook1"/> Alex Henderson of [[Allmusic]] believed that the other song on the ''Vision Quest'' soundtrack, titled "[[Gambler (Madonna song)|Gambler]]", should have been the more successful single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:wpfqxqlgldje|title=allmusic ((( Vision Quest <nowiki>[Original Soundtrack]</nowiki> > Overview )))|last=Henderson|first=Alex|date=2001-02-03|work=''[[Allmusic]]''|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=2010-02-02}}</ref> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from Allmusic called the song as one of her biggest hits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:azfrxqlkldje|title=allmusic ((( Something to Remember > Overview )))|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|date=2001-02-09|work=''Allmusic''|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=2010-02-02|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref> Biographer [[J.

== Chart performance ==

In the United States,  "Crazy for You" became Madonna's second number-one single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Bilboard'' Hot 100]].

Both he and Lind commented, "If you gotta lose to something, it as well be ['We Are the World']. Luckily enough, the final week of the upsurge of the record, we topped 'We Are the World', which lets you know how hot the song and how hot the artist was."<ref name="fred1"/> "Crazy for You" was certified [[RIAA certifications|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) on July 16, 1985, for shipment of one million copies of the single across United States <U+2013> the requirement for a gold single prior to 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Madonna&format=SINGLE&go=Search&perPage=50|title=Madonna <U+2013> Crazy for You <U+2013> Single certification|date=1985-05-11|accessdate=2010-02-02|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://spider.georgetowncollege.edu/music/burnette/Mus570d/terms.htm|title=Rock Music, Terms <U+2013> Gold disc|date=1999-10-26|work=[[Georgetown College (Kentucky)|Georgetown College]]|accessdate=2010-01-08|location=[[Georgetown, Kentucky]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Grein|first=Paul|date=1985-08-10|title=Hot Madonna: July Fills Her Coffers With RIAA Metal|journal=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|location=New York|volume=97|issue=32|pages=7|issn=0006-2510|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6iQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA7&dq=madonna+crazy+for+you&lr=&as_pt=MAGAZINES&cd=10#|accessdate=2010-02-03}}</ref> The song reached number two on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Adult Contemporary Singles]] and eighty on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Black Singles]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/adult-contemporary?chartDate=1985-05-04|title=Hot Adult Contemporary: Week of May 4, 1985|date=1985-05-04|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=2010-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/r-b-hip-hop-songs?chartDate=1985-05-11&order=gainer|title=Hot Black Singles: Week of May 11, 1985|date=1985-05-11|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=2010-02-02}}</ref> In Canada, the song debuted at number seventy on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' issue dated March 16, 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0497&volume=42&issue=1&issue_dt=March%2016%201985&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=4dp17sl7hp9qmhhj3vmcenr836|title=Top Singles <U+2013> Volume 42, No. 1, March 16 1985 |date=1985-03-16|work=[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]|publisher=RPM Music Publications Ltd|accessdate=2010-02-02}}</ref> On its eleventh week on the chart, the song reached the top position.<ref name="can">{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0527&volume=42&issue=11&issue_dt=May%2025%201985&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=4dp17sl7hp9qmhhj3vmcenr836|title=Top Singles <U+2013> Volume 42, No. 11, May 25 1985 |date=1985-05-25|work=RPM|publisher=RPM Music Publications Ltd|accessdate=2010-02-02}}</ref> It was present on the chart for twenty-five weeks<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0568&volume=42&issue=25&issue_dt=August%2031%201985&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=4dp17sl7hp9qmhhj3vmcenr836|title=Top Singles <U+2013> Volume 42, No. 25, August 31 1985 |date=1985-08-31|work=RPM|publisher=RPM Music Publications Ltd|accessdate=2010-02-02}}</ref> and ranked seventh on the ''RPM'' Year-end chart for 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0619&volume=43&issue=16&issue_dt=December%2028%201985&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=4dp17sl7hp9qmhhj3vmcenr836|title=RPM's Top 100 Singles Of 1985|date=1985-12-28|work=RPM|publisher=RPM Music Publications Ltd|accessdate=2010-02-02}}</ref> A music video was released, featuring Madonna singing the song in a night-club.
