==History==
The church was founded in November 1968 by a small group of Chicago [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] who noticed a newspaper advertisement asking for help to construct a new Unitarian church. Not long after its creation, the church was destroyed in the [[Great Chicago Fire]]. A new building and site were needed.<ref name="TUC"/>

Several sites were planned for the new building, and in 1936 an acceptable site was found. At the time of its inception, the architecture planned for the church was unorthodox and pioneering for its day. After the building's construction, an addition was added in 1956. The building was officially declared a landmark by Chicago's [[city council]] in 1960.<ref name="TUC"/>

Convicted murderer [[J. J. Jameson|Norman Porter]], a former resident of [[Massachusetts]] who escaped from prison and moved to Chicago, was a [[poetry|poet]] and an active member of the church for years under the alias "J. J. Jameson". He was arrested in 2005 when police entered the minister's office and Porter was present. He is currently serving two consecutive life sentences and three years in prison, but will be eligible for parole in 2010. A documentary film, ''Killer Poet'', was made about his life.<ref>{{cite web|title='Killer Poet' shares escapee's journey - The Boston Globe|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2008/06/07/tracking_a_mass_murder_mystery/|publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]''|last=Brokaw|first=Leslie|date=June 8, 2008|accessdate=April 13, 2009}}</ref>
