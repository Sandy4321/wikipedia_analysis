==Reception==
*"a quartet of buxom women with a mean look about them and an even meaner, vintage rockabilly sound." (Chris Riemenschneider, [[Star Tribune]])<ref name="st"/>
*"Taking cues from Suzi Quatro, Dum Dum Girls and Joan Jett, L'Assassins have created a series of propulsive songs that exude confidence." (Jon Schober, Andrea Swensson, [[KCMP|89.3 The Current]])<ref name="kcmp"/>
*"The four women from Minneapolis featured a throwback vibe in sound and dress. Chugging, rockabilly rhythms, colorful tattoos, sharp guitar, and flowers in hair proved a perfect match for the club. Singer Tee Ann Simpson connected with the crowd with her irrepressible energy." (Dave Miller, Chicago Concert Goers)<ref name="ccg"/>
*"this foursome brings an edgy style and even edgier sound to our music scene." (DeDe Ruger, MN Ups Magazine><ref name="mnu"/>
