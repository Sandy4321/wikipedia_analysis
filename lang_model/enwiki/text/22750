'''Colleen P. Jones''' (born December 16, 1959 in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[curling|curler]] and [[television personality]]. She is best known is the skip of two women's world championship teams and six [[Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Tournament of Hearts Canadian women's championships]], including an unprecedented four titles in a row. She also serves as a reporter and weather presenter for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], and as a curling commentator for the [[National Broadcasting Company]] in the [[United States]], particularly during the [[Winter Olympics]].

==Early career==
From a family of curlers, at age 14, she joined the [[Mayflower Curling Club]]. At an early age, she gained success in competitive curling and was only 19 years old when she won the first of her 16 Nova Scotia curling titles that led to competing in the Canadian championships where she finished second. Jones graduated from [[Dalhousie University]] and went to work in broadcasting in her native Halifax.

In 1982 she became the youngest ever to win the Canadian women's curling championship but career, marriage and a family slowed her down. She joined [[CBC Television]] as a reporter in 1986 and went on to cover numerous summer and winter [[Olympic Games]]. She continues to work for the CBC, and is currently the weather and sports reporter on [[CBC Newsworld]]'s ''CBC News: Morning''.

==Broadcasting career==

Jones is a TV personality, but began her broadcasting career in radio sports at CHUM radio in 1982.  She made the switch to television broadcasting in 1984 at CTV, and joined the CBC in 1986<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/programguide/personality/colleen_jones CBC Personalities - Colleen Jones]</ref>.

Beginning in 1993, Colleen Jones has been the weather presenter and sports reporter for [[CBC Morning News]] on [[CBC Newsworld]] (now [[CBC News Network]]). 

Jones starred in a [[public service announcement]] about the [[Canada 2006 Census]]. Jones appeared in the January 15, 2008 episode of ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' for a skit titled MVC ''Most Valuable Curler''. At the 2006 Torino Olympics, she did CBC segments about curling.

Jones provided curling commentary for [[NBC]]'s coverage of the [[2010 Winter Olympic Games]] in [[Vancouver, Canada]].

==Curling career==
In 1999, with her new team of [[Kim Kelly (curler)|Kim Kelly]], [[Mary Anne Arsenault|Mary Anne Waye (later Arsenault)]] and [[Nancy Delahunt]], Jones won the Canadian curling title for the second time. The team repeated this in 2001 and they went on to win the [[List of World Curling Women's Champions|World Curling Championship]] in [[Lausanne, Switzerland]]. They followed this up with another Canadian championship in 2002 and then won it for a record setting fifth time at the [[2004 Scott Tournament of Hearts]]. This made Jones the first skip to win four straight Canadian titles. From there the team went on to win their second World Curling Championship.

Their return at the [[2005 Scott Tournament of Hearts]] was not as stellar. The team finished the round-robin at 6-5 and lost in a tie-breaker to Sandy Comeau of [[New Brunswick]]. When this happened, the team got a standing ovation, which even halted play in the other game that was occurring two sheets over. The following year, the team was back in form, but bowed out in the semi-finals to [[Jennifer Jones (curler)|Jennifer Jones]]. 

After the 2006 season, her team broke up, and Jones joined the team of fellow Haligonian [[Kay Zinck]], as her third. The rest of the team got a new skip in [[Laine Peters]]. [http://www.canada.com/topics/sports/curling/story.html?id=e521e694-a536-43b3-986c-ae452b028a03&k=13995] 

In 2007, Jones went back to skipping, adding Olympic bronze medallist [[Georgina Wheatcroft]] to her team along with [[Kate Hamer]] and [[Darah Provencal]].  

Colleen Jones announced on March 24, 2010 on [[CBC News]] that she would be again returning to competitive curling.
