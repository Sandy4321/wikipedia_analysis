'''Stephen Jay Gould''' (September 10, 1941 <U+2013> May 20, 2002) was an American [[Paleontology|paleontologist]], [[Evolution|evolutionary biologist]] and [[History of science|historian of science]]. He was also one of the most influential and widely read writers of [[popular science]] of his generation.<ref name=Shermer2002>{{Citation | last1 = Shermer | first1 = Michael | year = 2002 | title = This View of Science | url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/shermer_sjgould.pdf | journal = Social Studies of Science | volume = 32 | issue = 4| pages = 489<U+2013>525 | postscript = . }}</ref>
Gould spent most of his career teaching at [[Harvard University]] and working at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York. In the latter years of his life, Gould also taught biology and evolution at [[New York University]] near his home in [[SoHo]].

Gould's greatest contribution to science was the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]] which he developed with [[Niles Eldredge]] in 1972.<ref name=punc1972>Eldredge, Niles, and S. J. Gould (1972). [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/eldredge.pdf "Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism."] In T.J.M. Schopf, ed., ''Models in Paleobiology''. San Francisco: Freeman, Cooper and Company, pp. 82-115.</ref> The theory proposes that most evolution is marked by long periods of evolutionary stability, which is punctuated by rare instances of [[Cladogenesis|branching evolution]]. The theory was contrasted against [[phyletic gradualism]], the popular idea that evolutionary change is marked by a pattern of smooth and continuous change in the fossil record.

Most of Gould's empirical research was based on the [[land snail]] genera ''[[Poecilozonites]]'' and ''[[Cerion (gastropod)|Cerion]]''. He also contributed to [[evolutionary developmental biology]], and has received wide praise for his book ''[[Ontogeny and Phylogeny (book)|Ontogeny and Phylogeny]]''. In evolutionary theory he opposed strict selectionism, [[sociobiology]] as applied to humans, and [[evolutionary psychology]]. He campaigned against [[creationism]] and proposed that science and religion should be considered two distinct fields, or "[[Non-overlapping magisteria|magisteria]]", whose authorities do not overlap.<ref name=noma>Gould, S. J. (1997).  [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html "Nonoverlapping magisteria".] ''Natural History'' 106 (March): 16-22.</ref>

Many of Gould's ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' essays were reprinted in collected volumes, such as ''[[Ever Since Darwin]]'' and ''[[The Panda's Thumb (book)|The Panda's Thumb]]'', while his popular treatises included books such as ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'', ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'' and ''[[Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin|Full House]]''.

==Biography==
Gould was born and raised in the community of [[Bayside, Queens|Bayside]], a quiet suburb located in the [[Queens]] [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of New York City. His father Leonard was a [[Court reporter|court stenographer]], and his mother Eleanor was an [[artist]]. When Gould was five years old, his father took him to the Hall of Dinosaurs in the [[American Museum of Natural History]], where he first encountered ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]''. "I had no idea there were such things<U+2014>I was awestruck," Gould once recalled.<ref name=Green86>Green, Michelle (1986). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/green_sjgould.html "Stephen Jay Gould: driven by a hunger to learn and to write".] ''People'' '''25''' (2 June): 109-114.</ref> It was in that moment that he decided to become a paleontologist. 

Raised in a secular Jewish home, Gould did not formally practice religion and preferred to be called an [[agnostic]].<ref name=noma /> Though he "had been brought up by a [[Marxism|Marxist]] father," he has stated that his father's politics were "very different" from his own.<ref name=SET>Gould, S. J. (2002). ''[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]]''. Cambridge: Belknap Press of [[Harvard University Press]]. [[Special:BookSources/0674006135|ISBN 0-674-00613-5]]</ref> In describing his own political views he has said they "tend to the left of center."<ref name="Gould_dep">Gould, S. J. (1981). [http://www.antievolution.org/projects/mclean/new_site/depos/pf_gould_dep.htm "Official Transcript for Gould<U+2019>s deposition in McLean v. Arkansas".] (Nov. 27). Under oath Gould stated: "My political views tend to the left of center. Q. Could you be more specific about your political views? A. I don't know how to be. I am not a joiner, so I am not a member of any organization. So I have always resisted labeling. But if you read my other book, The Mismeasure of Man, which is not included because it is not about evolution, you will get a sense of my political views". p. 153.</ref> According to Gould the most influential political books he read were [[C. Wright Mills]]' ''[[The Power Elite]]'' and the political writings of [[Noam Chomsky]].<ref name="Gould_dep" /> 

While attending [[Antioch College]] in the early 1960s, Gould was active in the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|civil rights movement]] and often campaigned for [[social justice]]. When he attended the [[University of Leeds]] as a visiting undergraduate, he organized weekly demonstrations outside a [[Bradford]] dance hall which refused to admit [[Black people|Blacks]]. Gould continued these demonstrations until the policy was revoked.<ref>Gasper, Phil (2002). [http://www.isreview.org/issues/24/gould.shtml "Stephen Jay Gould: Dialectical Biologist".] ''International Socialist Review'' '''24''' (July<U+2013>August).</ref> Throughout his career and writings he spoke out against [[Oppression|cultural oppression]] in all its forms, especially what he saw as [[pseudoscience]] used in the service of [[racism]] and [[sexism]].<ref>[[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin, Richard]] and [[Richard Levins]] (2002). [http://www.monthlyreview.org/1102lewontin.htm "Stephen Jay Gould<U+2014>what does it mean to be a radical?"] ''Monthly Review'' 54 (Nov. 1). "The public [[intellectual]] and political life of Steve Gould was extraordinary, if not unique. First, he was an evolutionary biologist and historian of science whose intellectual work had a major impact on our views of the process of evolution. Second, he was, by far, the most widely known and influential expositor of science who has ever written for a lay public. Third, he was a consistent political activist in support of socialism and in opposition to all forms of colonialism and oppression. The figure he most closely resembled in these respects was the British biologist of the 1930s, [[J. B. S. Haldane]], a founder of the modern genetical theory of evolution, a wonderful essayist on science for the general public, and an idiosyncratic Marxist and columnist for the [[Daily Worker]] who finally split with the [[Communist Party]] over its demand that scientific claims follow Party doctrine."</ref>

Gould was twice married. His first marriage was to artist Deborah Lee on October 3, 1965. Gould met Lee while they were students together at [[Antioch College]].<ref name=Green86 /> They had two sons, Jesse and Ethan. His second marriage was in 1995 to artist and sculptor [[Rhonda Roland Shearer]] who is the mother of two children, Jade and London Allen, stepchildren of Gould.<ref>Carol Kaesuk Yoon (2002). "Stephen Jay Gould, 60, Is Dead; Enlivened Evolutionary Theory." ''New York Times'' May 21, 2002.</ref>

In July 1982, Gould was diagnosed with [[peritoneal]] [[mesothelioma]], a deadly form of cancer affecting the [[Human abdomen|abdominal lining]] and frequently found in people who have been exposed to [[asbestos]]. After a difficult two-year recovery, Gould published a column for ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover magazine]]'', titled "The Median Isn't the Message", which discusses his reaction to discovering that mesothelioma patients had a [[median]] lifespan of only eight months after diagnosis.<ref>Gould, S. J. (1985). [http://www.cancerguide.org/median_not_msg.html "The Median Isn't the Message".] ''Discover'' 6 (June): 40-42.</ref>  He then describes the true significance behind this number, and his relief upon realizing that [[statistics|statistical averages]] are just useful abstractions, and do not encompass the full range of variation. 

The median is the halfway point, which means that 50% of patients will die before 8 months, but the other half will live longer, potentially much longer. He then needed to determine where his personal characteristics placed him within this range. Considering that the cancer was detected early, the fact he was young, optimistic, and had the best treatments available, Gould figured that he should be in the favorable half of the [[Skewness|upper statistical range]]. After an experimental treatment of [[Radiation therapy|radiation]], chemotherapy, and surgery, Gould made a full recovery, and his column became a source of comfort for many cancer patients.

Gould was also an advocate for [[medical cannabis|medical marijuana]]. During this bout with cancer, he smoked the illegal drug to alleviate the nausea associated with his medical treatments. According to Gould, his use of marijuana had a "most important effect" on his eventual recovery.<ref>Bakalar, James and Lester Grinspoon (1997). ''Marihuana, the Forbidden Medicine.'' New Haven: Yale University Press, [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_marijuana.html pp. 39-41.]</ref> In 1998 he testified in the case of [[Jim Wakeford]], a Canadian medical-marijuana user and activist.  

His scientific essays for ''Natural History'' frequently refer to his nonscientific interests and pastimes. As a boy he collected [[baseball card]]s and remained a fiercely avid [[baseball]] fan throughout his life. As an adult he was fond of [[science fiction film|science fiction]] movies but often lamented about their mediocrity (not just in their presentation of science, but in their [[storytelling]] as well).<ref>Gould, S. J. (1993). [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2483 "Dinomania".] ''New York Review of Books'' 40 (August 12): 51-56.</ref> His other interests included singing in the [[Boston Cecilia]], and he was a great aficionado of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] [[operetta]]s. He collected [[Book collecting|rare antiquarian books]] and [[textbooks]]. He often traveled to Europe, and spoke French, German, Russian, and Italian. He admired [[Renaissance architecture]]. When discussing the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition, he usually referred to it simply as "Moses". He sometimes alluded ruefully to his tendency to put on weight.<ref>Gould, S. J. (1983). ''[[Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes]]''. New York: W. W. Norton & Company. [[Special:BookSources/0393311031|ISBN 0-393-31103-1]].</ref>

Gould died on May 20, 2002 from a [[Metastasis|metastatic]] [[adenocarcinoma]] of the lung, a form of [[cancer]] which had spread to his brain.<ref name=HGdies>Harvard News Office (2002).

Retrieved on 2009-6-4.</ref> This cancer was unrelated to his abdominal cancer, from which he had fully recovered twenty years earlier. He died in his home "in a bed set up in the library of his [[SoHo]] loft, surrounded by his wife Rhonda, his mother Eleanor, and the many books he loved."<ref>Krementz, Jill (2002).

==Scientific career==
Gould began his higher education at [[Antioch College]], graduating with double major in [[geology]] and [[philosophy]] in 1963.<ref name="Allen2008">Allen, Warren (2008). [http://books.google.com/books?id=6iVOHEVeSFMC&pg=PA3 "The Structure of Gould".] In Warren Allen et al. ''Stephen Jay Gould: Reflections on His View of Life''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 24, 59.</ref> During this time, he also studied abroad at the [[University of Leeds]] in the United Kingdom.<ref>Masha, Etkin (2002).

Retrieved on 2009-6-4.</ref> After completing his graduate work at [[Columbia University]] in 1967 under the guidance of [[Norman D. Newell|Norman Newell]], he was immediately hired by [[Harvard University]] where he worked until the end of his life (1967<U+2013>2002). In 1973, Harvard promoted him to Professor of Geology and [[Curator]] of [[Invertebrate paleontology|Invertebrate Paleontology]] at the institution's [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]]. 

In 1982, Harvard awarded him with the title of [[Alexander Agassiz]] Professor of Zoology. The following year, in 1983, he was awarded fellowship into the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], where he later served as president (1999<U+2013>2001). The AAAS news release cited his "numerous contributions to both scientific progress and the public understanding of science." He also served as president of the Paleontological Society (1985<U+2013>1986) and the Society for the Study of Evolution (1990<U+2013>1991). 

In 1989 Gould was elected into the body of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. Through 1996<U+2013>2002 Gould was [[Vincent Astor]] Visiting Research Professor of Biology at [[New York University]].  In 2001 the [[American Humanist Association]] named him the Humanist of the Year for his lifetime of work.  In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the [[Darwin-Wallace Medal]], along with 12 other recipients.  Until 2008, this medal had been awarded every 50 years by the [[Linnean Society of London]].<ref>Linnean Society of London (2008).

===Punctuated equilibrium===
Early in his career, Gould and [[Niles Eldredge]] developed the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], in which evolutionary change occurs relatively rapidly, alternating with longer periods of relative evolutionary stability.<ref name=punc1972 /> According to Gould, punctuated equilibrium revised a key pillar "in the central logic of [[Evolution|Darwinian theory]]."<ref name = SET/> Some evolutionary biologists have argued that while punctuated equilibrium was "of great interest to biology,"<ref>[[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins, Richard]] (1999). ''The Extended Phenotype.'' Oxfordshire: Oxford University Press. p. 101. [[Special:BookSources/0192880519|ISBN 0-19-288051-9]].</ref> it merely modified [[Modern evolutionary synthesis|neo-Darwinism]] in a manner that was fully compatible with what had been known before.<ref name = PHT>{{Citation | doi = 10.1038/309401a0 | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = John | authorlink = John Maynard Smith | year = 1984 | title = Paleontology at the high table | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 309 | issue = 5967| pages = 401<U+2013>402 | postscript = . }}</ref>  Others however emphasized its theoretical novelty, and argued that evolutionary stasis had been "unexpected by most evolutionary biologists" and "had a major impact on paleontology and evolutionary biology."<ref name="Dynamics">[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr, Ernst]] (1992). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/mayr_punctuated.html "Speciational Evolution or Punctuated Equilibria".] In Steven Peterson and Albert Somit. ''The Dynamics of Evolution''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, pp. 21-48. [[Special:BookSources/0801497639|ISBN 0-8014-9763-9]].</ref> 

Some critics jokingly referred to the theory as "evolution by jerks,"<ref>Turner, John (1984). [http://books.google.com/books?id=6idhDboGmZoC&pg=PA34 "Why we need evolution by jerks."] ''New Scientist'' 101 (Feb. 9): 34-35.</ref> which elicited Gould to respond in kind by describing gradualism as "evolution by creeps."<ref>Gould, S. J. and Steven Rose, ed. (2007). ''The Richness of Life: The Essential Stephen Jay Gould''. New York: W. W. Norton & Co., [http://books.google.com/books?id=yfXJhKmp1wUC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA6 p. 6.]</ref>

===Evolutionary developmental biology===
Gould made significant contributions to [[evolutionary developmental biology]],<ref name="Evolution1st4billionyrs">Thomas, R.D.K. (2009). "Gould, Stephen Jay (1941<U+2013>2002)". in M. Ruse and J. Travis (eds). ''Evolution: The First Four Billion Years''. Cambridge MA: Belknap Press. pp. 611-615.</ref> especially in his work ''[[Ontogeny and Phylogeny (book)|Ontogeny and Phylogeny]]''.<ref name="Allen2008" /> In this book he emphasized the process of [[heterochrony]], which encompasses two distinct processes: [[pedomorphosis]] and terminal additions. Pedomorphosis is the process where [[ontogeny]] is slowed down and the organism does not reach the end of its development. Terminal addition is the process by which an organism adds to its development by speeding and shortening earlier stages in the developmental process. Gould's influence in the field of evolutionary developmental biology continues to be seen in such areas as the evolution of feathers.<ref>Prum, R.O., & Brush, A.H. (March 2003). "Which Came First, the Feather or the Bird?" Scientific American, vol.288, no.3, pp.84-93</ref>

===Selectionism and sociobiology===
Gould championed biological constraints such as the limitations of developmental pathways on evolutionary outcomes, as well as other non-selectionist forces in evolution. In particular, he considered many higher functions of the [[human brain]] to be the unintended [[Unintended consequence|side consequence]] or by-product of [[natural selection]], rather than direct [[adaptation]]s. To describe such co-opted features he coined the term [[exaptation]] with [[Elisabeth Vrba]].<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Gould | first1 = S. J. | last2 = Vrba | first2 = E. | year = 1982 | title = Exaptation<U+2014>a missing term in the science of form | url = http://evolutionanddesign.googlepages.com/Gould__Vrba_1982_Exaptation.pdf | journal = Paleobiology | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 4<U+2013>15 | postscript = . }}</ref> Gould believed this understanding undermines an [[Genetic determinism|essential premise]] of human [[sociobiology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]].

====Against "Sociobiology"====
In 1975, [[E. O. Wilson]] introduced his analysis of human behavior based on a sociobiological framework.<ref>Wilson, E. O. (1975). ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]''.  Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> In response, Gould, Richard Lewontin and [[Sociobiology Study Group|others]] from the [[Boston]] area wrote the subsequently well referenced letter to ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' titled "Against 'Sociobiology'". This [[open letter]] criticised Wilson's notion of a "deterministic view of human society and human action."<ref>Allen, Elizabeth, et al. (1975). [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/9017?sess=305fe41afae729849e1e7eb4b004bb81 "Against 'Sociobiology'".] [letter] ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' 22 (Nov. 13): 182, 184-186.</ref>

But Gould did not rule out sociobiological explanations for many aspects of animal behavior, writing: "Sociobiologists have broadened their range of selective stories by invoking concepts of inclusive fitness and kin selection to solve (successfully I think) the vexatious problem of altruism<U+2014>previously the greatest stumbling block to a Darwinian theory of social behavior. . . . Here sociobiology has had and will continue to have success. And here I wish it well. For it represents an extension of basic Darwinism to a realm where it should apply."<ref>Gould, S. J. (1980). "Sociobiology and the Theory of Natural Selection". In G. W. Barlow and J. Silverberg, eds., ''Sociobiology: Beyond Nature/Nurture?'' Boulder CO: Westview Press, pp. 257-269.</ref>

====Spandrels and the Panglossian Paradigm====

With [[Richard Lewontin]], Gould wrote an influential 1979 paper entitled "The Spandrels of [[St Mark's Basilica|San Marco]] and the [[Pangloss]]ian [[Paradigm]]",<ref>Gould, S. J. and Richard Lewontin (1979). [http://www.aaas.org/spp/dser/03_Areas/evolution/perspectives/Gould_Lewontin_1979.shtml "The spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian paradigm: a critique of the adaptationist programme".] ''Proc. R. Soc. Lond., B, Biol. Sci.'' 205 (1161): 581<U+2013>98. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1098%2Frspb.1979.0086 DOI] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/42062 PMID]; for background see Gould's [http://www.edge.org/documents/ThirdCulture/i-Ch.2.html "The Pattern of Life's History"] in John Brockman ''[http://www.edge.org/documents/ThirdCulture/d-Contents.html The Third Culture]''. New York: Simon & Schuster. 1996, pp. 52-64. [[Special:BookSources/0684823446|ISBN 0-684-82344-6]].</ref> which introduced the architectural term "[[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]]" into evolutionary biology. In architecture, a spandrel is a curved area of masonry which exists between arches supporting a dome. Spandrels, also called [[pendentive]]s in this context, are found particularly in [[gothic architecture|gothic churches]].

When visiting [[Venice]] in 1978, Gould noted that the spandrels of the [[St Mark's Basilica|San Marco]] cathedral, while quite beautiful, were not  spaces planned by the architect. Rather the spaces arise as "necessary architectural byproducts of mounting a dome on rounded arches." Gould and Lewontin thus defined spandrels in evolutionary biology to mean any biological feature of an organism that arises as a necessary side consequence of other features, which is not directly selected for by natural selection. Examples include the "masculinized genitalia in female [[Hyenas#Appearance_and_biology|hyenas]], exaptive use of an [[Umbilicus (mollusc)|umbilicus]] as a brooding chamber by snails, the shoulder hump of the giant [[Irish Elk|Irish deer]], and several key features of human mentality."<ref>Gould, S. J. (1997). [http://www.pnas.org/content/94/20/10750.full "The exaptive excellence of spandrels as a term and prototype".] ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.'' 94 (20): 10750<U+2013>5. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.94.20.10750 DOI] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11038582 PMID]</ref> 

In Voltaire's  ''[[Candide]]'', [[Candide#Synopsis|Dr. Pangloss]] is portrayed as a clueless scholar who, despite the evidence, says that "all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds." Gould and Lewontin asserted that it is Panglossian for evolutionary biologists to view all traits as [[Atomization|atomized things]] that had been naturally selected for, and criticised biologists for not granting theoretical space to other causes, such as phyletic and developmental [[Biological constraints|constraints]]. The relative frequency of spandrels, so defined, versus adaptive features in nature, remains a controversial topic in [[evolutionary biology]].<ref>Maynard Smith, John (1995). [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1703 "Genes, Memes, & Minds".] ''The New York Review of Books'' 42 (Nov. 30): 46<U+2013>48. "By and large, I think their [Spandrels] paper had a healthy effect. . . . Their critique forced us to clean up our act and to provide evidence for our stories. But adaptationism remains the core of biological thinking." A similar appraisal is reflected by [[Ernst Mayr]] in his 1983 paper "How to Carry Out the Adaptationist Program?" ''The American Naturalist'' 121 (3): 324<U+2013>334; and [[George C. Williams]], ''Natural Selection: Domains, Levels, and Challenges''. New York: Oxford University Press. 1992.</ref> An illustrative example of Gould's approach can be found in [[Elisabeth Lloyd|Elisabeth Lloyd's]] case study of the female orgasm as a by-product of shared developmental pathways.<ref name="caseofthefemaleorgasm">Lloyd, E.A. (2005). ''The Case of The Female Orgasm: Bias in the science of evolution''. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> Gould also wrote on this topic in his essay "Male Nipples and Clitoral Ripples",<ref name="bullyforbrontosaurus">Gould, S.J. (1992). [http://books.google.com/books?id=pzj90slTTEIC&pg=PA124 "Male Nipples and Clitoral Ripples".] In ''[[Bully for Brontosaurus]]: Further Reflections in Natural History''. New York: W. W. Norton. pp. 124-138.</ref> prompted by Lloyd's earlier work.

===Evolutionary progress===
Gould favored the argument that evolution has no inherent drive towards long-term [[Largest-scale trends in evolution|progress]]. Uncritical commentaries often portray evolution as a [[March of Progress (illustration)|ladder of progress]], leading towards bigger, faster, and smarter organisms, the assumption being that evolution is somehow driving organisms to get more complex and ultimately more like [[human]]kind. Gould argued that evolution's drive was not towards complexity, but towards [[biodiversity|diversification]]. Because life is constrained to begin with a [[abiogenesis|simple starting point]], any diversity resulting from this [[random walk|left wall]] will be perceived to move in the direction of higher complexity. But life, Gould argued, can easily adapt towards simplification, as is often the case with [[parasitism|parasites]].<ref>Gould, S. J. (1996). ''[[Full House: The Spread of Excellence From Plato to Darwin]]. New York: Harmony Books.</ref>

In a review of ''[[Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin|Full House]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] approved of Gould's general argument, but suggested that he saw evidence of a "tendency for lineages to improve cumulatively their adaptive fit to their particular way of life, by increasing the numbers of features which combine together in adaptive complexes. ... By this definition, adaptive evolution is not just incidentally progressive, it is deeply, dyed-in-the wool, indispensably progressive."<ref>{{Citation | doi = 10.2307/2411179 | last1 = Dawkins | first1 = Richard | last2 = Gould | year = 1997 | first2 = Stephen Jay | title = Human chauvinism | url = http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Reviews/1997-06fullhouse.shtml | journal = Evolution | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 1015<U+2013>1020 | postscript = . | jstor = 2411179 }}</ref>

===Cladistics===
Gould never embraced [[cladistics]] as a method of investigating evolutionary lineages and process, possibly because he was concerned that such investigations would lead to neglect of the details in historical biology, which he considered all-important. In the early 1990s this led him into a debate with [[Derek Briggs]], who had begun to apply quantitative cladistic techniques to the [[Burgess Shale]] fossils, about the methods to be used in interpreting these fossils.<ref>Gould, S. J. (1991). [http://webh01.ua.ac.be/funmorph/raoul/macroevolutie/Gould1991.pdf "The disparity of the Burgess Shale arthropod fauna and the limits of cladistic analysis".] ''Paleobiology'' 17 (October): 411-423.</ref> Around this time cladistics rapidly became the dominant method of classification in evolutionary biology.

===Technical work on land snails===
Most of Gould's empirical research pertained to land snails. He focused  his early work on the [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] genus [[Bermuda Land Snail|''Poecilozonites'']], while his later work concentrated on the [[Caribbean|West Indian]] genus ''[[Cerion (gastropod)|Cerion]]''. According to Gould "''Cerion'' is the land snail of maximal diversity in form throughout the entire world. There are 600 described species of this single genus. In fact, they're not really species, they all interbreed, but the names exist to express a real phenomenon which is this incredible morphological diversity. Some are shaped like golf balls, some are shaped like pencils.<U+2026>Now my main subject is the evolution of form, and the problem of how it is that you can get this diversity amid so little genetic difference, so far as we can tell, is a very interesting one. And if we could solve this we'd learn something general about the evolution of form."<ref>Wolpert, Lewis and Alison Richards (1998). ''A Passion For Science''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/wolpert_sjg-interview.html pp. 139-152.] [[Special:BookSources/0198542127|ISBN 0-19-854212-7]]</ref> 

Given ''Cerion's'' extensive geographic diversity, Gould later lamented that if [[Christopher Columbus]] had only cataloged a single ''Cerion'' it would have ended the scholarly debate over which island Columbus had first set foot on America.<ref>Gould, S. J. (1996). "A Cerion for Christopher". ''Natural History'' 105 (Oct.): 22-29, 78<U+2014>79.</ref>

===''The Structure of Evolutionary Theory''===
Shortly before his death, Gould published a long treatise recapitulating his version of modern evolutionary theory: ''[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]]'' (2002).

== As a public figure ==
Gould became widely known through his popular science essays in ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine and his best-selling [[#Bibliography|books]] on [[evolution]]. Many of his essays were reprinted in collected volumes, such as ''[[Ever Since Darwin]]'' and ''[[The Panda's Thumb (book)|The Panda's Thumb]]'', while his popular treatises included books such as ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'', ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'' and ''[[Full House: The Spread of Excellence From Plato to Darwin|Full House]]''.

A passionate advocate of evolutionary theory, Gould wrote prolifically on the subject, trying to communicate his understanding of contemporary evolutionary biology to a wide audience. A recurring theme in his writings is the history and development of evolutionary, and pre-evolutionary, [[History of evolutionary thought|thought]]. He was also an enthusiastic [[baseball]] fan and made frequent references to the sport in his essays. Many of his baseball essays were anthologized in his posthumously published book ''Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville'' (2003).<ref>Gould, S. J. (2003). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=XIJ-ay4GJ_kC&pg=PA Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville]''. New York: W. W. Norton & Co. See his essays: [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/4337 "The Streak of Streaks",] [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/4337 "Thcience Studies"], and [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1134/is_2_111/ai_83553539/ "Baseball's reliquary: the oddly possible hybrid of shrine and university"]</ref>

Although a proud Darwinist, his emphasis was less [[gradualism|gradualist]] and [[reductionism|reductionist]] than most [[neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinists]]. He fiercely opposed many aspects of [[sociobiology]] and its intellectual descendant [[evolutionary psychology]]. He devoted considerable time to fighting against [[creationism]] (and the related constructs [[Creation science]] and [[Intelligent design]]). Most notably, Gould provided expert testimony against the equal-time creationism law in ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]''. Gould later developed the term "non-overlapping magisteria" (NOMA) to describe how, in his view, science and religion could not comment on each other's realm.  Gould went on to develop this idea in some detail, particularly in the books ''Rocks of Ages'' (1999) and ''The Hedgehog, the Fox, and the Magister's Pox'' (2003). In a 1982 essay for ''Natural History'' Gould wrote:

{{quote|Our failure to discern a universal good does not record any lack of insight or ingenuity, but merely demonstrates that nature contains no moral messages framed in human terms. Morality is a subject for philosophers, theologians, students of the humanities, indeed for all thinking people. The answers will not be read passively from nature; they do not, and cannot, arise from the data of science. The factual state of the world does not teach us how we, with our powers for good and evil, should alter or preserve it in the most ethical manner.<ref>Gould, S. J. (1982). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_nonmoral.html "Nonmoral Nature".] ''Natural History'' 91 (Feb.): 19<U+2013>26.</ref>}}

The anti-evolution petition ''[[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism]]'' spawned the [[National Center for Science Education]]'s anti-petition [[Project Steve]], which is named in Gould's honor.

Gould also became a noted public face of science, often appearing on [[television]]. In 1984 Gould received his own [[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]] special on [[PBS]].<ref>PBS (1984). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/audio/gould_nova-special.html "Stephen Jay Gould: This View of Life".] NOVA. December 18.</ref> Other appearances included interviews on [[CNN|CNN's]] ''[[Crossfire (TV series)|Crossfire]]'', [[NBC|NBC's]] ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', and regular appearances on the [[Charlie Rose (talk show)|''Charlie Rose'']] show. Gould was also a guest in all seven episodes of the Dutch talk-series ''[[A Glorious Accident]]'', which he appeared with his good friend [[Oliver Sacks]].<ref>Sacks, Oliver (2007). [http://books.google.com/books?id=yfXJhKmp1wUC&pg=PP17 Forward.] In Steven Rose, ed. ''The Richness of Life''. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, p. xi. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJzqHnwNbUY Video]</ref> 

Gould was featured prominently as a guest in [[Ken Burns|Ken Burns']] [[PBS]] documentary ''[[Baseball (documentary)|Baseball]]'', as well as [[PBS|PBS's]] highly produced ''[[Evolution (TV series)|Evolution]]'' series. Gould was also on the Board of Advisers to the influential [[Children's Television Workshop]] television show, [[3-2-1 Contact]], where he made frequent guest appearances.
 
In 1997 he voiced a cartoon version of himself on the television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. In the episode "[[Lisa the Skeptic]]", Lisa finds a skeleton that many people believe is an [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] angel. Lisa contacts Gould and asks him to test the skeleton's [[DNA]]. However the fossil is discovered to be a marketing gimmick for a new mall.<ref>[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. ''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[Lisa the Skeptic]]", November 23, 1997. [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/audio/thesimpsons.rm Audio here.]</ref> During production the only phrase Gould objected to was a line in the script that introduced him as the "world's most brilliant paleontologist."<ref name="Scully">Scully, Mike (2006).

[[DVD]]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> In 2002 the show paid tribute to Gould after his death, dedicating the [[Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge|season 13 finale]] to his memory. Gould had died 2 days before the episode aired.

== Controversies ==
Gould received many accolades for his scholarly work and popular expositions of natural history,<ref name=HGdies/><ref>Shermer, Michael (2002). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/shermer_sjgould.pdf "This View of Science".] ''Social Studies of Science'' 32 (4): 518.<blockquote>Awards include a National Book Award for ''The Panda<U+2019>s Thumb'', a National Book Critics Circle Award for ''The Mismeasure of Man'', the Phi Beta Kappa Book Award for ''Hen<U+2019>s Teeth and Horse<U+2019>s Toes'', and a Pulitzer Prize Finalist for ''Wonderful Life'', on which Gould commented `close but, as they say, no cigar<U+2019>. Forty-four honorary degrees and 66 major fellowships, medals, and awards bear witness to the depth and scope of his accomplishments in both the sciences and humanities: Member of the National Academy of Sciences, President and Fellow of AAAS, MacArthur Foundation <U+2018>genius<U+2019> Fellowship (in the first group of awardees), Humanist Laureate from the Academy of Humanism, Fellow of the Linnean Society of London, Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Fellow of the European Union of Geosciences, Associate of the Mus<U+00E9>um National D<U+2019>Histoire Naturelle Paris, the Schuchert Award for excellence in paleontological research, Scientist of the Year from ''Discover'' magazine, the Silver Medal from the Zoological Society of London, the Gold Medal for Service to Zoology from the Linnean Society of London, the Edinburgh Medal from the City of Edinburgh, the Britannica Award and Gold Medal for dissemination of public knowledge, Public Service Award from the Geological Society of America, Anthropology in Media Award from the American Anthropological Association, Distinguished Service Award from the National Association of Biology Teachers, Distinguished Scientist Award from UCLA, the Randi Award for Skeptic of the Year from the Skeptics Society, and a ''Festschrift'' in his honour at Caltech.</blockquote></ref> but was not immune from criticism by those in the biological community who felt his public presentations were, for various reasons, out of step with mainstream evolutionary theory.<ref>Leda Cosmides and John Tooby (1997) write:<blockquote>John Maynard Smith, one of the world's leading evolutionary biologists, recently summarized in the NYRB the sharply conflicting assessments of Stephen Jay Gould: "Because of the excellence of his essays, he has come to be seen by non-biologists as the preeminent evolutionary theorist. In contrast, the evolutionary biologists with whom I have discussed his work tend to see him as a man whose ideas are so confused as to be hardly worth bothering with, but as one who should not be publicly criticized because he is at least on our side against the creationists." (NYRB, Nov. 30th 1995, p. 46). No one can take any pleasure in the evident pain Gould is experiencing now that his actual standing within the community of professional evolutionary biologists is finally becoming more widely known. . . But as Maynard Smith points out, more is at stake. Gould "is giving non-biologists a largely false picture of the state of evolutionary theory"&mdash;or as Ernst Mayr says of Gould and his small group of allies&mdash;they "quite conspicuously misrepresent the views of [biology's] leading spokesmen." Indeed, although Gould characterizes his critics as "anonymous" and "a tiny coterie," nearly every major evolutionary biologist of our era has weighed in a vain attempt to correct the tangle of confusions that the higher profile Gould has inundated the intellectual world with.* The point is not that Gould is the object of some criticism<U+2014>so properly are we all<U+2014>it is that his reputation as a credible and balanced authority about evolutionary biology is non-existent among those who are in a professional position to know. *These include [[Ernst Mayr]], [[John Maynard Smith]], [[George C. Williams|George Williams]], [[W. D. Hamilton|Bill Hamilton]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[E. O. Wilson|E.O. Wilson]], [[Tim Clutton-Brock]], [[Paul H. Harvey|Paul Harvey]], [[Brian Charlesworth]], [[Jerry Coyne]], [[Robert Trivers]], John Alcock, Randy Thornhill, and many others.</blockquote>It should be noted that Ernst Mayr in this quotation is not speaking of Gould in particular, and does not mention him by name, but is speaking generally of the critics of the Neo-Darwinian Synthesis. Some of the names Tooby and Cosmides cite are also questionable. For example, Mayr, Williams, Hamilton, Dawkins, Wilson, Coyne, and Trivers have shown great respect for Gould as a scientist. In reference to Maynard Smith's comments, Gould writes [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1151 "Darwinian Fundamentalism"] ''New York Review of Books'' 44 (June 12, 1997): 34-37:<blockquote>
:A false fact can be refuted, a false argument exposed; but how can one respond to a purely [[ad hominem]] attack? This harder, and altogether more discouraging, task may best be achieved by exposing internal inconsistency and unfairness of rhetoric. . . . It seems futile to reply to an attack so empty of content, and based only on comments by anonymous critics . . . Instead of responding to Maynard Smith's attack against my integrity and scholarship, citing people unknown and with arguments unmentioned, let me, instead, merely remind him of the blatant inconsistency between his admirable past and lamentable present. Some sixteen years ago he wrote a highly critical but wonderfully supportive review of my early book of essays, ''The Panda's Thumb'', stating: "I hope it will be obvious that my wish to argue with Gould is a compliment, not a criticism." He then attended my series of Tanner Lectures at Cambridge in 1984 and wrote in a report for ''Nature'', and under the remarkable title "Paleontology at the High Table", the kindest and most supportive critical commentary I have ever received. He argued that the work of a small group of American paleobiologists had brought the entire subject back to theoretical centrality within the evolutionary sciences. . . . So we face the enigma of a man who has written numerous articles, amounting to tens of thousands of words, about my work<U+2014>always strongly and incisively critical, always richly informed (and always, I might add, enormously appreciated by me). But now Maynard Smith needs to canvass unnamed colleagues to find out that my ideas are "hardly worth bothering with." He really ought to be asking himself why he has been bothering about my work so intensely, and for so many years.</blockquote></ref> The public debates between Gould's proponents and detractors have been so quarrelsome that they have been dubbed "The Darwin Wars" by several commentators.<ref>Brown, Andrew (1999).

[[John Maynard Smith]], an eminent British evolutionary biologist, was among Gould's strongest critics. Maynard Smith thought that Gould misjudged the vital role of adaptation in biology, and was also critical of Gould's acceptance of [[Unit of selection|species selection]] as a major component of biological evolution.<ref>Maynard Smith, John (1981). "Did Darwin get it right?" ''The London Review of Books'' '''3''' (11): 10-11; Also reprinted in ''Did Darwin Get it Right?'' New York: Chapman and Hall, 1989, pp. 148-156.</ref> In a review of [[Daniel Dennett]]'s book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', Maynard Smith wrote that Gould "is giving non-biologists a largely false picture of the state of evolutionary theory."<ref>Maynard Smith, John (1995).

Often he infuriates me, but I hope he will go right on writing essays like these."<ref>Maynard Smith, John (1981). "Review of ''The Panda's Thumb''" ''The London Review of Books'' pp. 17<U+2013>30; Reprinted as "Tinkering" in his ''Did Darwin Get It Right?'' New York: Chapman and Hall. 1989, pp. 94, 97.</ref> Maynard Smith was also among those who welcomed Gould's reinvigoration of evolutionary paleontology.<ref name = PHT/>

One reason for such criticism was that Gould appeared to be presenting his ideas as a revolutionary way of understanding evolution, and argued for the importance of mechanisms other than [[natural selection]], mechanisms which he believed had been ignored by many professional evolutionists. As a result, many non-specialists sometimes inferred from his early writings that Darwinian explanations had been proven to be unscientific (which Gould never tried to imply). Along with many other researchers in the field, Gould's works were sometimes deliberately taken out of context by [[Creationism|creationists]] as a "proof" that scientists no longer understood how organisms evolved.<ref name=Wright1999>Wright, Robert (1999). [http://www.nonzero.org/newyorker.htm "The Accidental Creationist: Why Stephen J. Gould is bad for evolution".] ''[[The New Yorker]]'' 75 (Dec. 13): 56-65.</ref> Gould himself corrected some of these misinterpretations and distortions of his writings in later works.<ref>Gould, S. J. (1981). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html "Evolution as fact and theory".] ''Discover'' '''2''' (May): 34-37.</ref>

Gould and Dawkins also disagreed over the importance of [[gene selection]] in evolution. Dawkins argued that evolution is best understood as competition among genes (or replicators), while Gould advocated the importance of multi-level selection, including selection amongst [[Transposon|genes]], [[Cell (biology)|cell lineages]], [[organism]]s, [[deme (biology)|demes]], [[species]], and [[clade]]s.<ref name="Sterelny" /> Criticism of Gould and his theory of punctuated equilibrium can be found in chapter 9 of Dawkins' ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' and chapter 10 of Dennett's ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]''. Dawkins subsequently offered a concession via an endnote in a new edition of his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', where he states:
<blockquote>
p.86 ''Progressive evolution may be not so much a steady upward climb as a series of discrete steps from stable plateau to stable plateau''<br>
This paragraph is a fair summary of one way of expressing the now well-known theory of punctuated equilibrium. I am ashamed to say that, when I wrote my conjecture, I, like many biologists in England at the time, was totally ignorant of that theory, although it had been published three years earlier. I have since, for instance in The Blind Watchmaker, become somewhat petulant - perhaps too much so - over the way the theory of punctuated equilibrium has been oversold. If this has hurt anybody's feelings, I regret it. They may like to note that, at least in 1976, my heart was in the right place.<ref name=Dawkins1989>Dawkins, Richard (1989). ''The Selfish Gene''.

=== Opposition to sociobiology and evolutionary psychology ===
Gould also had a long-running public feud with [[E. O. Wilson]] and other evolutionary biologists over [[sociobiology|human sociobiology]] and its later descendant [[evolutionary psychology]] (which Gould, Lewontin, and [[Maynard Smith]] opposed, but which [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Daniel Dennett]], and [[Steven Pinker]] advocated).<ref name=Gould1997>Gould, S.

He wrote:

{{quote|I grew up in a family with a tradition of participation in campaigns for social justice, and I was active, as a student, in the civil rights movement at a time of great excitement and success in the early 1960s. Scholars are often wary of citing such commitments. <U+2026> [but] it is dangerous for a scholar even to imagine that he might attain complete neutrality, for then one stops being vigilant about personal preferences and their influences<U+2014>and then one truly falls victim to the dictates of prejudice.

Norton & Co., p. 36. [[Special:BookSources/0140258248|ISBN 0-14-025824-8]]</ref>}}

Gould's primary criticism held that human sociobiological explanations lacked evidential support, and argued that adaptive behaviors are frequently assumed to be genetic for no other reason than their supposed universality, or their adaptive nature. Gould emphasized that adaptive behaviors can be passed on through [[meme|culture]] as well, and either hypothesis is equally plausible.<ref name="BioPotent">Gould, S. J. (1992).

Norton & Co., pp. 251-259.</ref> Gould did not deny the relevance of biology to human nature, but reframed the debate as "biological potentiality vs. biological determinism." Gould stated that the [[human brain]] allows for a wide range of behaviors. Its flexibility "permits us to be aggressive or peaceful, dominant or submissive, spiteful or generous<U+2026> Violence, sexism, and general nastiness ''are'' biological since they represent one subset of a possible range of behaviors. But peacefulness, equality, and kindness are just as biological<U+2014>and we may see their influence increase if we can create social structures that permit them to flourish."<ref name="BioPotent" />

=== Cambrian fauna ===

Gould's interpretation of the [[Cambrian]] [[Burgess Shale]] fossils in his book ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'' emphasized the striking morphological disparity (or "weirdness") of the Burgess Shale fauna, and the role of chance in determining which members of this fauna survived and flourished. He used the Cambrian fauna as an example of the role of [[contingency]] in the broader pattern of evolution.

Gould's view was criticized by [[Simon Conway Morris]] in his 1998 book ''The Crucible Of Creation''.<ref name=Conway1998>{{Citation | last1 = Conway Morris | first1 = S. | last2 = Gould | first2 = S.

He also promoted [[convergent evolution]] as a mechanism producing similar forms in similar environmental circumstances, and argued in a subsequent book that the appearance of human-like animals is likely. Paleontologists [[Derek Briggs]] and [[Richard Fortey]] have also argued that much of the Cambrian fauna may be regarded as [[stem group]]s of living taxa,<ref>{{Citation | doi = 10.1666/0094-8373(2005)031[0094:WSSSGA]2.0.CO;2 | last1 = Briggs | first1 = Derek | authorlink = Derek Briggs | authorlink2 = Richard Fortey | last2 = Fortey | first2 = Richard | year = 2005 | title = Wonderful Strife: systematics, stem groups, and the phylogenetic signal of the Cambrian radiation | url = http://www.colorado.edu/geolsci/courses/GEOL3410/BriggsFortey05_CambrianRadiation.pdf | journal = Paleobiology | volume = 31 | issue = 2| pages = 94<U+2013>112 | postscript = . }} [http://www.psjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1666/0094-8373(2005)031%5B0094%3AWSSSGA%5D2.0.CO%3B2 Abstract]</ref> though this is still a subject of intense research and debate, and the relationship of many Cambrian taxa to modern phyla has not been established in the eyes of many palaeontologists.

Paleontologist [[Richard Fortey]] noted that prior to the release of ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'', Conway Morris shared many of Gould's sentiments and views. It was only after publication of ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'' that Conway Morris revised his interpretation and adopted a more [[Evolutionary progress|progressive]] stance towards the history of life.<ref>

=== ''Mismeasure of Man'' ===
{{Main|The Mismeasure of Man}}

Gould was the author of ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' (1981), a [[History of science|history]] and inquiry of [[psychometrics]] and [[Intelligence quotient|intelligence testing]]. Gould investigated the methods of nineteenth century [[craniometry]], as well as the history of [[Intelligence quotient|psychological testing]]. Gould claimed that both theories developed from an unfounded belief in [[biological determinism]], the view that "social and economic differences between human groups&mdash;primarily [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]], [[Social class|classes]], and [[sexes]]&mdash;arise from inherited, inborn distinctions and that [[society]], in this sense, is an accurate reflection of biology."<ref>Gould, S.

==Non-overlapping magisteria ==
{{Main|Non-overlapping magisteria}}
In his book ''[[Rocks of Ages (book)|Rocks of Ages]]'' (1999), Gould put forward what he described as "a blessedly simple and entirely conventional resolution to...the supposed conflict between science and religion."<ref name=RoA>Gould, S. J. (2002). ''[[Rocks of Ages|Rocks of Ages: Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life]]''. New York: Ballantine Books.</ref> He defines the term ''magisterium'' as "a domain where one form of teaching holds the appropriate tools for meaningful discourse and resolution."<ref name = RoA/> The non-overlapping magisteria (NOMA) principle therefore divides the magisterium of science to cover "the empirical realm: what the Universe is made of (fact) and why does it work in this way (theory).  The magisterium of religion extends over questions of ultimate meaning and moral value.  These two magisteria do not overlap, nor do they encompass all inquiry."<ref name=RoA />  He suggests that "NOMA enjoys strong and fully explicit support, even from the primary cultural stereotypes of hard-line traditionalism" and that NOMA is "a sound position of general consensus, established by long struggle among people of goodwill in both magisteria."<ref name = RoA/> This view has not been without criticism, however. In his book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] argues that this division is not quite as simple as it seems, as few religions exist without miracles impinging on the scientific magisterium.
