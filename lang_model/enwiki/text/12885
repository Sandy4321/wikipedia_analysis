In May 2003, a [[tropical cyclone]] officially called ''Very Severe Cyclonic Storm BOB 01''<ref>{{cite report|publisher=India Meteorological Department|accessdate=2014-04-29|title=Best Tracks Data (1990 - 2013)|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/bestpara.xls|format=XLS}}</ref> produced the worst flooding in [[Sri Lanka]] in 56&nbsp;years. The first storm of the [[2003 North Indian Ocean cyclone season]], it developed over the [[Bay of Bengal]] on May&nbsp;10. Favorable environmental conditions allowed the system to intensify steadily while moving northwestward. The storm reached peak [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 140&nbsp;km/h (85&nbsp;mph) on May&nbsp;13, making it a [[Tropical cyclone scales#North Indian Ocean|very severe cyclonic storm]] according to the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD), which is the official [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] for the basin.<ref>{{cite report|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|date=2011-09-11|title=Worldwide Tropical Cyclone Centers|accessdate=2012-08-27|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutrsmc.shtml}}</ref> The cyclone drifted north over the central Bay of Bengal, gradually weakening due to heightened [[wind shear]]. Turning eastward, the storm deteriorated to a deep depression on May 16 before it curved northeastward and re-intensified into a cyclonic storm. It came ashore in western [[Myanmar]] and dissipated over land the following day.

In the wake of prolonged precipitation during the first half of May, the cyclone produced torrential rains across southwest Sri Lanka while stationary in the central Bay of Bengal. The storm drew extensive moisture that coalesced in the mountainous portion of the island. A station at [[Ratnapura]] recorded {{convert|366.1|mm|in|Abbr=on}} of rainfall in 18&nbsp;hours on May&nbsp;17, including {{convert|99.8|mm|in|abbr=on}} in one hour. In southwestern Sri Lanka, the rainfall caused flooding and landslides that destroyed 24,750&nbsp;homes and damaged 32,426&nbsp;others, displacing about 800,000&nbsp;people. Overall damage totaled about $135&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD)]],{{#tag:ref|All currencies are in 2003 values of their respective currencies.|group="nb"}} and there were 260&nbsp;deaths. The cyclone also produced light rainfall in the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] of India and along the county's Bay of Bengal. The storm funneled moisture away from the mainland, which possibly contributed to a heat wave that killed 1,900&nbsp;people, and dropped heavy rainfall in Myanmar.

==Preparations and impact==

===Sri Lanka===
[[File:Sri_Lanka_-_Location_Map_(2011)_-_LKA_-_UNOCHA.svg|right|thumb|Location map of Sri Lanka]]
Due to the significant distance between Sri Lanka and the Bay of Bengal storm, no cyclone warnings were posted. The India-based [[National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting]] anticipated the flood event three days in advance.<ref name="water2">{{cite journal|author=Lareef Zubair|journal=Natural Hazards|volume=33|number=3|year=2004|title=May 2003 Disaster in Sri Lanka and Cyclone 01-B in the Bay of Bengal|accessdate=2014-04-25|url=http://water.columbia.edu/files/2011/11/Zubair2004Disaster.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> However, the Sri Lankan government did not issue the first flood warnings until May&nbsp;17, the same day that the flooding began. Many residents learned about the impending floods through loudspeakers and word of mouth, although some were alerted by television or radio. About 8,000&nbsp;people evacuated on May&nbsp;18, utilizing schools and public buildings as emergency shelters. The precipitation occurred in the wake of an already rainy period; a station near the [[Kalu River]] reported over {{Convert|600|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rainfall in the first 15&nbsp;days of May.<ref name="icharm">{{cite report|title=Factor Analysis of Water-related Disasters in Sri Lanka|work=The International Centre for Water Hazard and Risk Management|ISSN=0386-5878|page=52, 57, 59-61, 67, 103, 111|publisher=Public Works Research Institute|author=Junichi Yoshitani|author2=Norimichi Takemoto|author3=Tarek Merabtene|url=http://www.icharm.pwri.go.jp/publication/pdf/pdf_0706/sri_e.pdf|year=2007|accessdate=2014-04-28|format=PDF}}</ref>

While the storm was nearly stationary in the central Bay of Bengal, the southwesterly flow drew abundant moisture over Sri Lanka to produce severe flooding. In the island's mountainous southwestern portion, the winds across the island produced heavy rainfall rates through a process known as [[Precipitation types#Orographic|orographic lift]], mostly occurring on May&nbsp;17&ndash;18. Throughout May 2003, the highest rainfall in the country was {{convert|899|mm|in|abbr=on}} at Gonapenigala Iranganie Estate. A station at [[Ratnapura]] recorded {{convert|718|mm|in|abbr=on}} of precipitation in the month,<ref name="Water"/> of which {{convert|366.1|mm|in|abbr=on}} fell over an 18<U+2011>hour period on May&nbsp;17; at the same station, there was a peak hourly rainfall total of {{convert|99.8|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="icharm"/> These were the heaviest rains on the island since 1947.<ref name="ifrc519"/> Rainfall was primarily concentrated in southwestern Sri Lanka, with a [[rain shadow]] farther inland that resulted in minimal precipitation in and [[Matale]].<ref name="Water"/> After the Kalu River overflowed, floodwaters reached {{Convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep in Ratnapura City, submerging the first floors of most homes and persisting for about three days.
