==History==
The original [[Moving_block_signalling#Moving_block|moving block signaling]] system for rapid transit was introduced by [[Urban Transportation Development Corporation]] (a Crown Corp in Ontario) and was successfully implemented for the [[Scarborough RT]] in Toronto, Ontario, which was opened in 1985.
UTDC was later absorbed by [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]] (train Manufacturing) and Alcatel (Rail Signaling Solutions)
In April, 2006, [[Thales Group]] announced it would be acquiring [[Alcatel]]'s space business (67% of [[Alcatel Alenia Space]] and 33% of [[Telespazio]]), and Alcatel's Rail Signalling Solutions division in a deal which also raised Alcatel's ownership of Thales to 21.66 percent.
