The '''Miami Metrorail''', officially '''Metrorail''' and commonly called the '''Metro''', is the [[heavy rail]] [[rapid transit]] system of [[Miami]], [[Florida]], [[United States]], serving the [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Greater Miami]] area. The Metro is operated by [[Miami-Dade Transit]] (MDT), a departmental agency of [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]]. Opened in 1984, it is Florida's only rapid transit metro system, and is currently composed of {{convert|22.4|mi|km}} of line with 22 stations.

The Metro serves the urban core of Miami, connecting the [[central business district]]s of [[Downtown Miami]], [[Brickell]] and the [[Civic Center (Miami)|Civic Center]] with the Greater Miami neighborhoods of [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]] and [[Medley, Florida|Medley]] to the northwest, and to [[Coconut Grove]], [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]], [[South Miami, Florida|South Miami]], ending at [[Dadeland, Florida|Dadeland]] in suburban [[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]]. The Metro connects to the [[Metromover]] in Downtown, which provides metro service to the entirety of Downtown and [[Brickell]]. Additionally, it connects to South Florida's [[commuter rail]] system at [[Tri-Rail and Metrorail transfer station|Tri-Rail Station]]. The Metro has seen increased [[ridership]] growth over the years, with an average daily ridership of 66,000 passengers, {{asof|2011|11|lc=y}} (96,100, including [[Metromover]]).<ref name="Nov2011RidershipTechnical"/> 

In 2012, the Metro will open its 23rd station, [[Miami Central Station]], at [[Miami International Airport]] (MIA), opening a 16-station re-branded Orange Line between the MIA and [[Dadeland South (Metrorail station)|Dadeland South]] stations. The new line is expected to increase ridership significantly, adding millions of riders per year,<ref name="AirportLinkvideoCounty">{{cite web|url=http://miamidade.gov/wps/PA_1_TC5RNSJDM7JC0027AB79NQ10L5/ondemand_view.jsp?itemid=292647&play=HiRes|title=AirportLink|publisher=Miami-Dade County|year=2011|accessdate=2012-01-05}}</ref> and allowing residents and visitors alike direct access from the MIA to [[Downtown Miami]], and greater connectivity between various modes of transit throughout Miami-Dade County. Central Station will provide direct service to [[Amtrak]] [[inter-city rail]] services, [[Tri-Rail]] [[commuter rail]], [[Greyhound Lines]] intercity bus, and the [[Miami Intermodal Center|Rental Car Center]]. Miami Central Station is expected to attract 150,000 daily commuters and travelers.<ref name="DSI America">{{cite web|url=http://www.dsiamerica.com/references/commercial-buildings/modern-transportation-hub-at-miami-airport-usa.html|title=Zero Void <U+00AE> Monostrand System Stabilizes Modern Transportation Hub at Miami Airport|publisher=[[DYWIDAG-Systems International]]|accessdate=2012-01-05}}</ref>

In 1971, a study completed by the Miami Urban Area Transportation Study (MUATS) recommended the construction for a rapid transit system for the county.<ref name="History1970s">{{cite web|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/about_history_1970.asp|title=History 1970s|publisher=Miami-Dade County|accessdate=2012-01-16}}</ref> Having experienced a prolonged post-[[World War II]] population boom, metropolitan Dade County's permanent population rose by 35% to nearly 1.3 million residents within a decade, among the fastest population growth rates in the United States.<ref name="CensusScope">{{cite web|url=http://www.censusscope.org/us/s12/c86/chart_popl.html|title=Miami-Dade County Population Growth|publisher=CensusScope.org|accessdate=2012-01-05}}</ref> Within a year of the study, county residents approved a $132.5 million (${{Inflation|US|132.5|1972|r=1}} million, adjusted for current inflation) [[municipal bond|bond]] dedicated to transit, with additional funding approved by the [[Florida Legislature]] for transit which, up until that time, operated solely on fare revenue. In 1976, with preliminary engineering completed for the system, the [[Federal Transit Administration]] (FTA, then, the Urban Mass Transit Administration) committed 80% of the costs for the first stage of rapid transit system, with the county and state incurring the remaining cost. In the end the system cost over a billion dollars.<ref name="aboutmetrorail">{{cite web|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/about_metrorail.asp|title=Metrorail Facts|publisher=[[Miami-Dade County]]|accessdate=2011-12-27}}</ref>

In April 1979, the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] ratified an agreement between the [[Florida East Coast Railway]] (FEC) and Dade County to transfer the then-FEC [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] along [[U.S. Route 1 in Florida|US 1]] to Miami-Dade Transit, then named the Metro Transit Agency (MTA). [[Groundbreaking]] for the system the [[county commission]] voted to be named "Metrorail" took place at the site of what would become University Station in June. Construction began in December 1980 with placing of a double-tee guideway [[girder]] near the [[University of Miami]]. The entire original {{convert|21|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} line contained 2,704 girders, constructed at a cost of $55,887,830.<ref name="History1980s">{{cite web|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/about_history_1980.asp|title=History 1980s|publisher=Miami-Dade County|accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref> In June 1983, the first segment of Metrorail, 10 stations from Dadeland South to Overtown (now "Historic Overtown/[[Lyric Theater (Miami, Florida)|Lyric Theatre]]") was completed with the construction of the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]] Bridge. Revenue operation commenced on May 20, 1984 with 125,000 taking the free first-day service from [[Pinecrest, Florida|Pinecrest]]/Dadeland to Overtown.<ref name="twoofakind"/>

Additional segments between Earlington Heights and Okeechobee opened between December 1984 and May 1985. In March 1989, a temporary station was opened to provide a connection to the newly-opened [[Tri-Rail]] [[commuter rail]] line, with the now permanent station officially opening in June. Preliminary engineering for a rapid transit extension to the [[Florida State Road 826|Palmetto Expressway]] began in 1996 with [[Palmetto (Metrorail station)|Palmetto Station]] opening in May 2003. As far as operational costs, revenues expected for 2006 were $17.15 million, while expenses budgeted for 2006 were $41.29 million. These historic figures became the last the Miami Dade Transit Authority ever disclosed, and are the figures still displayed on today's Miami-Dade Transit webpage as of January 2012.<ref name="aboutmetrorail"/>

With the area having a generally low [[population density|density]] and lacking [[transit-oriented development]],<ref name="fectrirailprivatization">{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/blog/2011/08/tri-rail-privatization-studied-as-way.html?page=all|title=Tri Rail privatization studied as way to add FEC commuter service|author=Gale, Kevin|date=24 August 2011|work=[[South Florida Business Journal]]|accessdate=13 October 2011}}</ref> the Metrorail was designed as a [[park and ride]] system, with the idea being that suburban residents would drive to the stations, then commute the rest of the way into the city. Nearly all of the stations outside of downtown Miami have parking facilities, except Tri-Rail Station. Several have large [[parking garage]]s, such as [[Dadeland North (Metrorail station)|Dadeland North]] and South stations, located at the southern end of the system, which combined have space for over 3,000 cars.<ref name="DadelandNorth">{{cite web|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/rail_dadeland_north.asp|title=Dadeland North Metrorail Station|publisher=Miami-Dade County|accessdate=2012-01-15}}</ref><ref name="DadelandSouth">{{cite web|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/rail_dadeland_south.asp|title=Dadeland South Metrorail Station|publisher=Miami-Dade County|accessdate=2012-01-15}}</ref> [[Earlington Heights]], located just northwest of Downtown and adjacent to [[Interstate 95 in Florida|Interstate 95]] and the [[Florida State Road 112|Airport Expressway]], has a large garage that was formerly dedicated to Metrorail riders.

===Ridership growth and transit tax===
[[File:Kendall Dadeland ramp.jpg|thumb|left|The urban area known as [[Dadeland]] is a part of unincorporated [[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]] that sprouted around the two Dadeland metro stations.]]
After the initial segment of the single Green Line opened,  Metrorail's saw less than 10,000 riders per day. This increased to 15,000 after the rest of the line and stations opened in late 1984 and 1985.<ref name="ReaganSun"/> After running out of money due to [[cost overrun]]s, the originally planned to be {{convert|50|mi|km|0}} system consisting of several lines was never completed, and lack of transit-oriented development along the single line led to the system being regarded as a [[boondoggle (project)|boondoggle]]. President [[Ronald Reagan]] commented that, given the low number of riders, it would have been cheaper to buy them all a limousine than the billion dollar cost of building and subsidizing the system.<ref name="letsexpandmetrorail">{{cite web|url=http://criticalmiami.com/index.php?id=335|title=Let's expand Metrorail|publisher=Critical Miami|date=December 29, 2005|accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref> The federal subsidy was approximately $800 million of the $1.02 billion used to fund the line.

Consequently, the southern nine stations from Kendall to Downtown Miami have higher ridership than the northern end.<ref name="ReportsArchive"/> This part of the system also has a higher average speed, having fewer curves and long distances between stations as it follows the congested [[South Dixie Highway]].<ref name="takenforaride"/> During the 1990s, ridership growth was relatively stagnant, however, and Metrorail remained the subject of criticism.<ref name="BulletTrainLessons1998">{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1998-03-16/news/9803130148_1_bullet-train-tri-rail-metrorail|title=Bullet Train Lessons In Past Rail Projects|work=[[Sun Sentinel]]|date=March 16, 1998|author=Frame, Clifford|accessdate=2012-01-17}}</ref> At this time, ridership was up to about 50,000 per day, about a quarter of the original ridership estimate.<ref name="pennytaxbillions">{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1999-07-17/news/9907161416_1_sales-tax-sales-tax-ballot-language|title=Penny-tax Ruling May Cost Billions|work=[[Sun Sentinel]]|date=July 17, 1999|author=Weaver, Jay; Schuster, Karla|accessdate=2012-01-17}}</ref>

Metrorail briefly ran a 24-hour hourly service from 12am to 5am and rush hour peak headways were reduced to 6 minutes, but the idea of the transit tax was sold to voters as being able to fund up to {{convert|88.9|mi|km}} of additional Metrorail track by the 2030 long range plan, beginning with a completion of an Orange Line north corridor and east<U+2013>west line by 2016. As it turned out, Miami-Dade Transit was running a deficit and used some of the tax to close the books, as well as using some to hire new staff, pay rent, and buy furniture for their new headquarters at [[Historic Overtown/Lyric Theatre (Metrorail station)|Historic Overtown/Lyric Theatre Station]].  By the [[late 2000s recession]], it was realized that only the {{convert|2.4|mi|adj=on}} AirportLink of the Orange Line would be funded, and after service cuts in 2008, Metrorail was running fewer trains than before the tax was passed.<ref name="gascostsrise2011">{{cite web|url=http://www.masstransitmag.com/news/10255359/as-gas-costs-climb-ridership-on-metrorail-is-rising|title=As Gas Costs Climb, Ridership on Metrorail is Rising|author=Miami Herald|publisher=Mass Transit Mag|year=2011|accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref> In response to all this, ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' published a comprehensive [[investigative journalism|expos<U+00E9>]] titled "Taken For A Ride, How the transit tax went off track", detailing all of the promises that were not kept as well as what money was misspent and how.<ref name="takenforaride">{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/news/transit/p1-graphic.html|title=Taken For A Ride|date=June 2009|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|accessdate=2012-01-12}}</ref> Despite the service cuts, due to the rise in energy prices and ever-increasing congestion, as well as a significant amount of residential development in the downtown area, ridership continued to grow during the 2000s, averaging well over 60,000 weekday riders throughout 2011.<ref name="ReportsArchive">{{cite web|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/news_technical_reports_archive.asp|title=Ridership Technical Reports Archive|publisher=Miami-Dade County|accessdate=2012-01-05}}</ref><ref name="OtherReportsArchive">{{cite web|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/news_technical_reports.asp|title=Ridership Technical Reports|publisher=Miami-Dade County|year=2011|accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref> However, this is still short of the 1985 estimate of 75,000 daily riders that were expected by the end of that year.<ref name="ReaganSun"/> The transit tax also funded improvements to the adjoining [[Metromover]] system, including removal of the 25 cent fare, with the idea that higher ridership on the system would lead to higher Metrorail ridership, as well as the realization that the cost of fare collection exceeded fare revenue.<ref name="twoofakind">{{cite web|url=http://web1.ctaa.org/webmodules/webarticles/articlefiles/rail/rail19/Miami_Metrorail_Metromover.pdf|title=Two of a Kind: Miami's Metrorail & Metromover|author=Holle, Gena|publisher=Community Transportation Association|accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref>

Metrorail runs from the northwest in [[Medley, Florida|Medley]] through [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]], into the city of Miami, the downtown area, through [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]] and [[South Miami, Florida|South Miami]], and ending in southwest Miami-Dade at Dadeland Mall. There are 22 [[Accessibility|accessible]] Metrorail stations, one about every 1.25 miles (or 1.9 kilometers). Metrorail connects to the [[Metromover]] system at [[Government Center (MDT station)|Government Center]] and [[Brickell (changeover station)|Brickell]] stations and to [[South Florida metropolitan area|South Florida]]'s [[Tri-Rail]] suburban [[commuter rail]] system at the [[Tri-Rail and Metrorail transfer station|Tri-Rail Station]] (see below).

Trains are stored at the Lehman Yard just west of Okeechobee Station.<ref name="2011TDP"/> The yard houses 136 cars built by the [[Budd Company]];<ref name="fedsnewcars"/> Miami-Dade's subway cars were among the last orders Budd filled before shuttering its railcar manufacturing business. The cars are identical to those used on the [[Metro Subway (Baltimore)|Baltimore Metro]] (save for the modifications made to Baltimore's cars during their refurbishment in 2005), as the two systems were built at the same time, and the two agencies were able to save money by sharing a single order. Trains draw power from an electric [[third rail]]. The cars are {{convert|75|ft|m}} long, {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide and have a top design speed of over {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Each car can hold up to 166 passengers (76 seated, 90 standing).<ref name="Roads to the Future">{{cite web|url=http://www.roadstothefuture.com/Baltimore_Metro.html|title=Baltimore Metro Subway|work=Roads to the Future|author=Scott M.

The Miami-Dade County Government was working with the Citizens Independent Transportation Trust (CITT) to receive money from the half-penny sur-tax approved by voters in 2002 in order to purchase new Metrorail cars.

Along the Metrorail system, the tracks are mostly elevated. The three sections that are not are under I-95 between Vizcaya and Brickell stations, under I-95 just east of Culmer station, and the northern end of the line from just east of the [[Palmetto Expressway]] heading west into the Palmetto station and tail track. In each of these cases, the tracks ride on ground level for a brief amount of time.

The platform at each Metrorail station is long enough to accommodate six-car-long trains; the Dadeland North, Earlington Heights, and Government Center station platforms are long enough to accommodate eight-car-long trains. In-service trains are usually either four or six cars long; in the evening it is not uncommon for Miami-Dade Transit to link two out-of-service trains together before returning them to Palmetto Yard.

==AirportLink==
[[File:AirportLink December.jpg|thumb|left|The AirportLink guideway under construction in 2011]]
{{Main|AirportLink (Miami)}}
In May 2009, Miami-Dade County broke ground on the AirportLink Metrorail Extension Project, a 2.4-mile extension of Metrorail that will run from the existing Earlington Heights station to the Miami Intermodal Center (MIC), now under construction next to Miami International Airport (MIA).<ref name="airportlinkofficial"/>

Scheduled to open on July 28, 2012, the AirportLink is considered the centerpiece of the People's Transportation Plan (PTP), approved by Miami-Dade voters in 2002. The bulk of the funding for the $506 million project will come from the PTP half-penny tax, with the [[Florida Department of Transportation]] contributing $101.3 million.<ref name="airportlinkofficial"/>

The AirportLink will provide a reliable transit connection to the airport for the millions of residents, visitors and employees who travel to and from MIA every year. With this project, Miami-Dade County joins the many major metropolitan areas around the world with rapid transit connections to their airports. In June 2011, when the Metrorail portion of the project was 81% complete, the project end date was slated as April 29, 2012.<ref name="MICJune11PDF">{{cite web|url=http://www.micdot.com/news_room/presentations/AirportLink%20MIC%20Steering%20Committee%2006.24.11.pdf|title=Miami-Dade Transit<U+2019>s AirportLink Metrorail Extension|publisher=Miami-Dade County|date=June 24, 2011|accessdate=2012-01-17}}</ref> As of January 2012, the AirportLink track work is 100% complete, the substations have been electrified and load testing with two-car trains has commenced.<ref name="AirportLinkTimeline">{{cite web|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/improve_airport_status.asp|title=AirportLink Metrorail Extension Project Time Line|publisher=Miami-Dade County|accessdate=2012-01-19}}</ref>

The final phase of the Miami Central Station project, which will serve Tri-Rail and [[Amtrak]] with a station located next to the metro station, began construction in September 2011 and is expected to open in 2013.<ref name="SFBJcentralstation2013">{{cite web|url=http://www.miami-airport.com/pdfdoc/clips_biz-central-station.pdf|title=Miami Central Station construction begins|publisher=[[South Florida Business Journal]]|date=September 27, 2011|accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref> The original Metrorail line was initially planned to be built to the airport, but due to political pressure and lobbying was instead directed to its current alignment around the airport and to [[Hialeah]].<ref name="heraldairportlink90%">{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/01/02/2570929/metrorail-line-to-miami-international.html|title=Metrorail line to Miami International Airport almost complete|publisher=Miami Herald|date=January 2, 2012|author=Chardy, Alfonso|accessdate=2011-12-02}}</ref>

The current standard fare on Metrorail is $2 and reduced fare is $1. A standard [[season ticket|monthly pass]] costs $100 and $50 for reduced fare. The monthly Easy Cards are sold at over 50 sales outlets. Reduced fares are available only to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] recipients, people with [[disability|disabilities]], and Miami-Dade students in grades 1 through 12. [[Ticket machine|ticket vending machines]]  (TVMs) that sell Easy Cards and Easy Tickets are found in all rail stations. All Miami-Dade senior citizens aged 65 years and older and with [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits, and veterans residing in Miami-Dade and earning less than $22,000 annually ride free with the reduced fare monthly Easy Card.<ref name="TransitFares">{{cite web|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/fares.asp|title=Transit Fares|publisher=Miami-Dade County|accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref> All of the stations except the five in the downtown area and Tri-Rail station have dedicated parking available.

On July 16, 2008, Miami-Dade Transit announced that it would be replacing all fare collection methods with the [[Easy Card]] system by late 2009. The system replaces the old cash and token-based system with one that automatically deducts fares at Metrorail [[fare gate]]s from a reloadable card.<ref name="CountyEasyCard">{{cite web|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/advisories/08-07-14-easy_card_google.asp|title=Miami-Dade Transit unveils EASY Card and Google Transit Trip Planner|publisher=Miami-Dade County|date=July 14, 2008|accessdate=2012-01-05}}</ref><ref name="EasyCardVideo">{{cite web|url=http://miamidade.gov/wps/PA_1_TC5RNSJDM7JC0027AB79NQ10L5/ondemand_view.jsp?itemid=47503|title=Easy Does It!|publisher=Miami-Dade County|accessdate=2012-01-05}}</ref><ref name="WhatistheEasyCard">{{cite web|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/library/pdfs/misc/easy_card_brochure011209.pdf|title=What is the Easy Card?|publisher=Miami-Dade County|date=January 2009|accessdate=2012-01-05}}</ref> The final station to start fare gate installation was Government Center on August 2, 2009.

Miami-Dade Transit initially mitigated this issue by limiting credit card transactions to three per day and a value limit of $112, and later by requiring zip code verification for all cards.<ref name="CBSEasyCardfraud">{{cite news|url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2010/09/14/i-team-dades-easy-card-becomes-easy-fraud/|title=I Team: Dade<U+2019>s Easy Card Becomes Easy Fraud|date=September 14, 2010|publisher=[[WFOR-TV]]|accessdate=2012-01-05}}</ref>

From 2009 to 2011, free [[wi-fi]] was added to Metrorail and [[Metromover]] cars and stations, as well as certain Metrobus routes, with all Metrorail cars now having it.<ref name="wificbs">{{cite news|url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2011/02/23/metro-transit-commuters-to-get-free-wi-fi/|title=Miami-Dade Metro Transit Commuters To Get Free Wi-Fi|publisher=[[WFOR-TV]]|date=February 23, 2011|accessdate=2012-01-15}}</ref>

Metrorail runs from 5 a.m. until midnight seven days a week. Trains arrive every 10 minutes during weekday rush hours, every 15 minutes at midday, and every 15<U+2013>30 minutes after 6 p.m. until midnight. Weekend service runs every 30 minutes until midnight.<ref name="HoursofOperation"/> For a brief period from 2003 to April 2004 there was 24-hour service supported by the transit tax; between midnight and 5 a.m. trains arrived every 60 minutes. 

A [[limited-stop]] bus route, Route 500 Midnight Owl, operates hourly between 12:30 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. trip between Dadeland South and Government Center Metrorail stations.  This bus service replaces the 24-hour Metrorail service cancelled due to a lack of ridership.

===Proposed expansions===
[[File:Government Center ghost platform.jpg|thumb|right|The unused east-west platform at [[Government Center (MDT station)|Government Center]] station, built in 1984 with the existing system but never being completed.]]
From the beginning, the Metrorail was designed and envisioned to have more lines than the current single line; however, the federally subsidized cost of the original line ended up over budget at $1.02 billion,<ref name="aboutmetrorail"/> after which ridership was much lower than expected. The proposed lines included<ref name="takenforaride"/>:

*The {{convert|13.6|mi|km|abbr=on}} Biscayne/Northeast Corridor following [[U.S. Route 1 in Florida|U.S. Route 1]] ([[Biscayne Boulevard]]) from Government Center up to the [[Broward County, Florida|Broward]]/Miami-Dade county line in [[Aventura, Florida|Aventura]].
*The {{convert|9.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} North Corridor up NW 27 Avenue to the county line.

*The {{convert|17.2|mi|km|abbr=on}} East<U+2013>West Corridor from Government Center west to the [[Florida International University]] main campus in [[University Park, Florida|University Park]], as well as east from Government Center to the [[Port of Miami]].

*The {{convert|5.1|mi|km|abbr=on}} BayLink from Historic Overtown/Lyric Theater station to [[South Beach]], [[Miami Beach]].

*The South Link, a {{convert|21|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} extension of the Green Line from Dadeland South to [[Florida City]], 

*The {{convert|4.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} Douglas Road extension from [[Douglas Road (Metrorail station)|Douglas Road]] station to the [[Miami Intermodal Center]].

*The {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} (West) Kendall Corridor down [[Florida State Road 94|Kendall Drive]] from Dadeland North station west to [[West Kendall, Florida|West Kendall]] and north to the FIU main campus.

It was not until the half-penny transit tax was passed in 2002 that any serious expansion plans were again considered, with the North Corridor and East<U+2013>West lines, both dubbed the "Orange Line," assuming the highest priority, while the possibility of {{convert|88.9|mi|km}} of additional rail if all the extensions were built by 2030, was touted. However, after budget deficits, other uses of the tax revenue, and a downgrade of the North Corridor's funding priority to medium-low by the federal government, after 10 years only the 2.4 mile AirportLink and Orange Line remained promised and realized. 

The credibility of Miami-Dade Transit and the County as a whole, including the validity of their ridership estimates and revenue forecasts, has been a significant impediment to their qualifications for funding under the [[Federal Transit Administration]]'s (FTA) approval.<ref name="NorthCorridorWord"/> In 2011, Miami-Dade Transit underwent a serious federal investigation and takeover by the FTA in which it was forced to open its books over suspicions of money mismanagement.<ref name="miamiheraldjuly7">{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/07/07/2303266/miami-dade-county-commission-to.html|title=Miami-Dade to weigh $100M loan for ailing Transit Agency|author=Martha Brannigan and Alfonso Chardy|date=July 7, 2011|publisher=The [[Miami Herald]]|accessdate=2012-01-16}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The Agency threatened to cease its funding used to cover operational costs, which would have meant significant cuts in service; however, they took the funding under their strict control to prevent this from happening.<ref name="miamiheraldmay10">{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/05/10/2211021/miami-dade-transit-agency-eyes.html|title=Miami-Dade transit agency eyes service cuts as feds hold back money|author=Martha Brannigan, Alfonso Chardy and Matthew Haggman|date=May 10, 2011|publisher=Miami Herald|accessdate=2012-01-16}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
