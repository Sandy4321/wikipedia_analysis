"'''Dancehall Queen'''" is a song by Swedish recording artist [[Robyn]], taken from her fifth studio album, ''[[Body Talk Pt. 1]]'' (2010). The song was written by [[Klas <U+00C5>hlund]], who produced it with disc jockey [[Diplo (DJ)|Diplo]]. The initial writing and production of the song arose from a discussion by Robyn, Diplo and <U+00C5>hlund about [[Ace of Base]]. The song features a [[dancehall]] and [[reggae]]-infused sound with 1980s synths and subwoofers. It was released as a promotional single before the album was launched in April 2010.

The song received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. Some praised its hook and chorus, while others dismissed its overall sound. "Dancehall Queen" charted at number fifty-six on the [[Sverigetopplistan]] chart and was listed there for only a week. The accompanying music video, released in November 2010, was directed by Diplo, Red Foxx and Pomp&Clout. It resembles a karaoke tape with sing-along lyrics on the bottom of the screen. Robyn herself does not appear in the clip.

==Background==
In November 2009, a video of Robyn and [[Diplo (DJ)|Diplo]] working on "Dancehall Queen" in the studio was posted onto YouTube.<ref name="Idolator">{{cite news|url=http://idolator.com/5406482/robyn-is-off-to-the-club-with-new-song-no-hassle|title=Robyn Is Off To The Club With New Song <U+201C>Dancehall Queen<U+201D>|work=''[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]''|publisher=[[Buzz Media|Buzzmedia]]|date=12 February 2010|last=Daw|first=Robbie|accessdate=6 April 2011}}</ref> The song originally leaked onto the Internet in February 2010, under the title "No Hassle".<ref name="MTVBuzz">{{cite news|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2010/02/17/new-robyn-song-produced-by-diplo/|title=Song You Need To Know: Robyn's 'No Hassle,' Produced By Diplo|date=17 February 2010|last=Ryan|first=Chris|work=MTV Buzzworthy|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|accessdate=5 April 2011}}</ref> In an interview with music website [[Stereogum]], Robyn spoke of the song's origin, saying; "We [Robyn, Diplo and Klas <U+00C5>hlund] were talking about [[Ace of Base]] and we were just having fun with that kind of genre music.

{{cquote|In my world, there are people who have already pushed those boundaries [of musical style] forward enough for me to feel comfortable doing a song like 'Dancehall Queen', so it's not a big deal to me. It's not about making black music as much as it's about making music that relates to real things that I grew up with.

==Reception==
Marc Hogan of Pitchfork called the song a "so-wrong-it's-right collaboration with tastemaking Philadelphia DJ/producer Diplo."
