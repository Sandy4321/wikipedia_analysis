==Plot==
[[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] attend a candy convention and hire Ashley Grant, a college-aged [[feminism|feminist]], to babysit [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]. At the convention, Homer outfits Marge with an oversized [[trenchcoat]] and is vigilant in smuggling out as much candy as possible in her pockets, until a [[gummi bear|gummy]] [[Venus de Milo]] catches his eye. Using Marge as a distraction and deploying a bomb made out of [[Pop Rocks]] and a [[soft drink]], Homer is able to steal the Gummy Venus. 

That night, Homer searches for the gummy Venus but is unable to find it. Marge reminds him to take Ashley home and Homer grudgingly obliges. As Ashley is exiting Homer's car he sees the gummy Venus stuck to the backside of her pants. Homer innocently grabs the candy and Ashley turns around to see Homer drooling [[lust]]ily. Misinterpreting his poor tact as a deliberate sexual advance, Ashley runs off screaming in terror while Homer gleefully eats the candy.

The next morning, an angry [[Crowd|mob]] marches onto the Simpsons' lawn and claims that Homer [[sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] Ashley. Homer tries to explain his actions, but the crowd is not interested in his side of the story and continually harasses Homer. "''Rock Bottom''", a tabloid news show, wants to interview him about his predicament and Homer immediately agrees to be interviewed. However, the interview is heavily edited into a totally inaccurate segment where Homer is portrayed as a sexual [[pervert]]. Things go from bad to worse as a media circus arrives at the Simpson home to provide 24 hour coverage of things such as Marge letting the cat out and the family watching TV. Lisa and Marge suggest Homer videotape himself telling his side of the story to air on a [[public access television|public access TV channel]], but all he succeeds in doing is angering an old-time bicyclist.  

However, [[Groundskeeper Willie]] also saw Homer's speech, and arrived at the Simpson home with a video tape of what happened the night Homer took Ashley home. The tape clearly shows that Homer was grabbing the Gummy Venus and Ashley and the media apologize for labeling Homer as a monster. Later on, the Simpson family is watching a "''Rock Bottom''" episode that labels Willie as a disgusting voyeur and Homer immediately declares that he is evil. Marge asks Homer if he learned anything from his experiences, to which Homer replies that he hasn't learned a thing.<ref name=officialsite/><ref name="Simpsguide">{{cite book|last=Martyn |first=Warren|coauthors=Adrian Wood|title=I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide |year=2000 |publisher=Virgin Books|id=ISBN 0-7535-0495-2|pages=}}</ref><ref name="SNPP">[http://www.snpp.com/episodes/2F06.html Episode Capsule] at The Simpsons Archive</ref><ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|id=ISBN 0-00063-8898-1|pages=p. 173}}</ref>

==Production==
[[Greg Daniels]], the writer of the episode, originally pitched this episode as being more centered on Lisa and Homer's opposing ideas on feminism. Eventually, the episode became more of a satire of the media and shows like ''[[Hard Copy]]''.<ref name="Daniels">{{cite video | people=Daniels, Greg|year=2005|title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer Badman"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> [[David Mirkin]], the show runner at the time, felt very strongly about the "tabloidization of the media" and has said that the episode is as current today as it was at the time and things have since gotten worse.<ref name="Mirkin">{{cite video | people=Mirkin, David|year=2005|title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer Badman"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Several gags in the episode are based on what real life shows like ''Hard Copy'' would do, such as making people look to be guilty without a trial as well as a complete invasion of privacy by setting up camp outside peoples homes.<ref name="Mirkin"/> The talk show "Ben" reflects the writers' feeling that any person could host a talk show because all they need is a microphone and an audience.<ref name="Mirkin"/>

===Casting===
[[Dennis Franz]] was the writers' second choice for the role of Homer but the first choice pulled out.<ref name="Mirkin"/> The original actor, whose name they refused to say, was apparently "barrel chested."<ref name="Lynch">{{cite video | people=Lynch, Jeffrey|year=2005|title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer Badman"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

The action sequence at the Candy convention is "based on every [[Bruce Willis]] movie ever made."<ref name="Mirkin"/> Homer's imagination of living underwater is a parody of the song "[[Under the Sea]]" from the [[Disney]] film ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''. David Mirkin says he thought the sequence would be funny because Homer would eat all of the characters from ''The Little Mermaid''.<ref name="Mirkin"/> Among the TV shows parodied during the episode: ''[[Hard Copy]]'', [[Sally Jessy Raphael]], the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and media coverage of the [[O.J. Simpson]] standoff. Also when Willie appears on Rock Bottom they parodie [[Rowdy Roddy Piper]] when they say his name is Rowdy Roddy Peeper. <ref name="Mirkin"/>
