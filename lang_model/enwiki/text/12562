'''''R. v. Lifchus''''', [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320 is a leading [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on the legal basis of the "[[beyond a reasonable doubt]]" standard for [[Criminal law in Canada|criminal law]]. Cory J. outlined several core principles the reasonable doubt standard and provided a list of points that must be explained to a jury when they are to consider the standard.

==Background==
Lifchus was a stockbroker who misrepresented the value of a bond in his personal margin account to his employer, defrauding them of a substantial amount of money. He was charged with fraud and theft of over $1000. 

Lifchus was convicted of fraud before a jury. He appealed on the ground that the jury was misinstructed about the standard of "proof beyond a reasonable doubt".

There were four issues before the Court:
1)  Must a trial judge provide the jury with an explanation of the expression <U+201C>reasonable doubt<U+201D>?
2)  If so, how should this concept be explained to the jury?
3)  Did the charge in this case amount to a misdirection on the meaning of <U+201C>reasonable doubt<U+201D>?
4)  If the charge in this case was insufficient, ought this Court give effect to the curative proviso set out at s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code?

==Opinion of the Court==
The Court found in favour of Lifchus and ordered a new trial. The opinion of the Court was written by Cory J. with a minority opinion by L'Heureux-Dub<U+00E9> J.

Cory used the case as an opportunity to describe the significance of the "reasonable doubt" standard. He described it as a fundamental principle in criminal justice and was intertwined with the [[presumption of innocence]]. As such, the description of the meaning to the jury must be done very carefully.

===Guidelines===
Cory provides a series of principles upon which a trial judge must formulate their definition of "reasonable doubt" to a jury.

<blockquote>
''It should be explained that:
*''the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is inextricably intertwined with that principle fundamental to all criminal trials, the presumption of innocence;
*''the burden of proof rests on the prosecution throughout the trial and never shifts to the accused;
*''a reasonable doubt is not a doubt based upon sympathy or prejudice;
*''rather, it is based upon reason and common sense;
*''it is logically connected to the evidence or absence of evidence;
*''it does not involve proof to an absolute certainty; it is not proof beyond any doubt nor is it an imaginary or frivolous doubt; and
*''more is required than proof that the accused is probably guilty -- a jury which concludes only that the accused is probably guilty must acquit.

''On the other hand, certain references to the required standard of proof should be avoided. For example:
*''describing the term "reasonable doubt" as an ordinary expression which has no special meaning in the criminal law context;
*''inviting jurors to apply to the task before them the same standard of proof that they apply to important, or even the most important, decisions in their own lives;
*''equating proof "beyond a reasonable doubt" to proof "to a moral certainty";
*''qualifying the word "doubt" with adjectives other than "reasonable", such as "serious", "substantial" or "haunting", which may mislead the jury; and
*''instructing jurors that they may convict if they are "sure" that the accused is guilty, before providing them with a proper definition as to the meaning of the words "beyond a reasonable doubt".
</blockquote>

==Aftermath==
The later cases of ''[[R. v. Bisson]]'', [1998] 1 S.C.R. 306 and ''[[R. v. Starr]]'' [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144 elaborate on the principles established here.
