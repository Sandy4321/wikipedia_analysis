The '''[[Constitution]] of the [[Thailand|Kingdom of Thailand]]''' is the supreme [[law]] of the Kingdom of Thailand.  Since the coup backed change from the absolute to the constitutional monarchy in 1932, Thailand has had 17 charters and constitutions, reflecting the high degree of political instability and frequency of military [[coups]] faced by the nation.  After successful coups, military regimes abrogated existing constitutions and promulgated interim ones.

All of Thailand's charters and constitutions have allowed a [[constitutional monarchy]], but with widely differing [[Checks and balances|balances of power]] between the branches of government. Most of them have stipulated [[parliamentary systems]], however, several of them also called for [[dictatorships]], e.g., the 1957 Charter. Both [[unicameral]] and [[bicameral]] parliaments have been used, and [[members of parliament]] have been both [[election|elected]] and appointed.  The direct powers of the monarch have also varied considerably.

Thailand's first permanent constitution was promulgated in 1997.  Called the "[[1997 Constitution of Thailand|People's Constitution]]", it was considered a landmark in terms of the degree of [[public participation]] involved in its drafting as well as the democratic nature of its articles.  It stipulated a bicameral [[legislature]], both houses of which are elected.  Many [[human rights]] were explicitly acknowledged, and measures were established to increase the stability of elected governments.  

However, following an army-led [[September 2006 Thailand coup|coup on 19 September 2006]], the 1997 Constitution was abrogated.  The junta ruled the country by martial law and executive decree for weeks, until it promulgated an [[2006 Interim Constitution of Thailand|interim constitution]] on [[1 October]] [[2006]].  The Interim Constitution allowed the junta to appoint a Prime Minister, legislature, and drafting committee for a [[Next constitution of Thailand|permanent constitution]].  Human rights were broadly acknowledged, but media censorship as well as bans against assembly and political activities were not repealed.

Charters have traditionally been temporary instruments, promulgated following military [[coup]]s.  However, some charters, for instance the 1959 Charter of military dictator [[Sarit Dhanarajata]], were used for years at a time.<ref>For the remainder of the article, "charter" ({{lang-th|<U+0E18><U+0E23><U+0E23><U+0E21><U+0E19><U+0E39><U+0E0D> or <U+0E18><U+0E23><U+0E23><U+0E21><U+0E19><U+0E39><U+0E0D><U+0E01><U+0E32><U+0E23><U+0E1B><U+0E01><U+0E04><U+0E23><U+0E2D><U+0E07>}}) and "constitution" (({{lang-th|<U+0E23><U+0E31><U+0E10><U+0E18><U+0E23><U+0E23><U+0E21><U+0E19><U+0E39><U+0E0D>}}) will be used interchangeably</ref>  The [[2006 Thailand coup|2006 coup]] resulted in an interim constitution rather than an interim charter.

The great number of charters and constitutions is indicative of the degree of political instability Thailand has faced in its modern history.  The majority of charters and constitutions were the direct or indirect result of military coups.  Charters and constitutions for much of Thai history can be thought of, not as instruments of the people to control the government, but as instruments by which a government controls its people.

All of Thailand's charters and constitutions have allowed a [[constitutional monarchy]].  Widely varying, however, have been the strength of the [[legislature]], the extent to which the legislature is appointed vs. elected, the power of the monarch, and the strength of the [[executive (government)|executive]].  These parameters have been influenced by the political and military strength of the regime and the degree of support from the king and the palace.  For instance, the 1959 Charter gave [[Sarit Dhanarajata]] absolute power over the executive and the legislature, which reflected the overwhelming strength with which he executed a coup over [[Plaek Pibulsonggram]] as well as his strong support from the palace.

Based on the degree by which the legislature is elected, Thailand's 17 constitutions and charters can be categorized into 3 groups:
[[Image:Evolution of Thai constitutions 1932-2006 not bold.png|thumb|right|400px]]
# Elected legislatures: The legislature is completely elected.  This included the 1946 Constitution (where the elected House selected the Senate) and the [[1997 Constitution of Thailand|1997 Constitution]] (where both the House and Senate are elected).
# Appointed legislatures: The legislature is partly elected and partly appointed by the executive.  The appointed members of the legislature are sufficient to limit the power of the elected representatives.  The Prime Minister is either a military leader or a figurehead of the military or the palace.  This includes the (after 1937), the 1947 Charter, the 1949 Constitution, the 1952 Constitution, the 1968 Constitution, the 1974 Constitution, the 1978 Constitution, and the 1991 Constitution.
# Absolute executives: The executive has absolute or near absolute power, with either no legislature or a completely appointed legislature.  The Prime Minister is usually a military leader or a figurehead of the military or the palace.  This includes the 1932 constitutions (before 1937), the 1959 Charter, the 1972 Charter, the 1976 Constitution, the 1991 Charter, and Thailand's last charter, the [[2006 Interim Charter of Thailand|2006 Interim Charter]].

==1932 Temporary Charter==
''See also the [[Siamese Revolution of 1932]]''

On 24 June 1932, the [[People's Party (Thailand)|People's Party]], a coalition of civil servants, princes, and army officers, seized power in a bloodless [[coup]].  A provisional constitution was sent to King [[Prajadhipok]] along with an ultimatum from Party leaders.  On 26 June, the King met the Party leaders and refused to sign the charter.  The [[27 June|next day]], the King met the leaders again and signed the charter.

The People's Party leaders generally followed the [[Westminster system|British parliamentary structure]] for the temporary charter.  However, there were key differences, particularly regarding the powers of the monarch.  

The charter began by stating that [[sovereignty|sovereign]] power belongs to the people of [[Siam]].<ref name="Handley">Paul M. Handley, "[[The King Never Smiles]]" Yale University Press: 2006, ISBN 0-300-10682-3</ref>  Empowered to exercise power on behalf of the people were the People's Assembly (the [[legislature]]), a 15-member People's Committee (the [[executive (government)|executive]]), the courts of law (the [[judiciary]]), and the monarch.  Members of the People's Assembly and the People's Committee were initially appointed.  <!--After 5 years, the Assembly would be half-elected, half-royally appointed, and the Prime Minister would be royally selected from one of the appointed MPs.-->  After 10 years or after half the population had completed [[primary education]], the Assembly would be completely elected.<ref name="Albritton">Robert B. Albritton and Thawilwadee Bureekul, [http://www.asianbarometer.org/newenglish/publications/workingpapers/no.28.pdf Developing Democracy under a New Constitution in Thailand], National Taiwan University and Academia Sinica Asian Barometer Project Office Working Paper Series No. 28, 2004</ref><ref name="Murashima">Eiji Murashima, [http://www.waseda-coe-cas.jp/paper/20040720_murashima1_eng.pdf Democracy and the Development of Political Parties in Thailand, 1932-1945], Chapter 1 of Eiji Murashima, Nakharin Mektrairat, and Somkiat Wanthana, ''The Making of Modern Thai Political Parties'', Joint Research Programme Series No.86, Institute of Developing Economies, Tokyo, 1991</ref>

The monarch was not held to be [[infallibility|infallible]].  He had a limited degree of [[sovereign immunity]]: although he could not be prosecuted in an ordinary court of law, the Assembly could [[impeachment|impeach]] and try him.  The monarch did not have the right to grant [[pardon]]s.

Several other features would be mirrored in later constitutions.  The monarch would not have an absolute [[veto]] - any law sent back to the Assembly, which could approve it with a [[simple majority]].  The charter followed the [[1924 Palace Law of Succession|1924 Palace Law]] with regards to [[Order of succession|succession]] - however, the Assembly reserved the right to formally approve the successor.

In practice, the People's Party made many concessions to the palace in putting together the new government.  The Premiership and the Foreign Ministry were given to 2 hard-line royalists: Phraya [[Manopakorn Nitithada]] and Phraya [[Srivisan Vacha]].  A total of 4 members of the People's Committee were royalists who were not part of the People's Party.<ref name="Handley" />  Of the 70 members of the legislature, less than half came from the People's Party, while the majority were high-ranking officials of the old regime.<ref name="Murashima" />

Despite this, the charter provoked fierce resistance from the palace.  The new government reduced the palace budget and passed a taxation law that burdened the Kingdom's largest landowners, who were mostly nobles.  In September 1932, a senior prince threatened the King's [[abdication]] if a permanent constitution did not grant the palace greater power.<ref name="Wichit">Scott Barme, "Luang Wichit Wathakan and the Creation of a Thai Identity, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 1993, page 72</ref>

==1932 Constitution==
[[Image:ThaiConstitutionRoyalEndorsement.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Prajadhipok|King Prajadhipok (Rama VII)]] signs The Constitution of the Siam Kingdom 1932 on [[December 10]], [[1932]]]]
The People's Party, facing an internal power struggle and opposition from the King, promulgated a permanent constitution in [[10 December]] [[1932]] that gave the monarchy a significant increase in authority compared to the temporary charter.  The day is currently celebrated as Constitution Day.

The constitution continued to state that [[sovereignty|sovereign]] power belonged to the people of [[Siam]].  However, unlike the temporary charter, the monarchy would now be the direct exerciser of that power, rather than the branches of government.  This royal power would be exercised by and with the advise and consent of the People's Assembly, the State Council (the cabinet), and the Courts.  However, the monarchy lacked any say in the composition of any of the branches of government and the royal veto could still be overruled.  The monarchy was also made "sacred and inviolable", in contrast to the temporary charter.<ref name="Handley" />

After the new Constitution was promulgated, a new 20-member Cabinet was formed; 10 of whom came from the People's Party. On [[7 January]] [[1933]], the Nationalist Party ({{lang-th|<U+0E04><U+0E13><U+0E30><U+0E0A><U+0E32><U+0E15><U+0E34>}}) was officially registered, with Luang Vichitvadakan, Phraya Thonawanikmontri, and Phraya Senasongkhram as leaders; the People's Party had been officially registered in August 1932.<ref name="Murashima" />

===Demands for constitutional reform===
On [[31 January]] [[1933]], the King sent a letter to the Premier requesting that all political parties be abolished.  On 14 April, the Premier disbanded the People's Party.  He later adjourned the legislature and reshuffled the leadership of the Army, giving leadership to Phraya Phichaisongkhram and Phraya [[Sri Sithi Songkhram]], both military leaders during the absolute monarchy. On 20 June, the remnants of the People's Party military faction seized power and reinstated the legislature.<ref name="Murashima" />

In August 1933, the government began registering candidates for village representatives who would cast votes in indirect elections for half of the legislature.  It also started registering candidates for the legislature. Elections in some provinces started in October, but most were held in November.

During the midst of the elections, in October 1933, royalist factions led by Prince [[Boworadej]] and Phraya [[Sri Sitthi Songkhram]] led a rebellion against the government.  After two weeks of violent fighting, during which Bangkok was bombed and [[Sri Sitthi Songkhram]] was killed, the People's Party defeated the rebels.  Prince [[Boworadej]] fled abroad.  Prince King [[Prajadhipok]], who claimed neutrality during the conflict, fled to England a few weeks after the defeat.  

From London, the King issued an ultimatum: in exchange for his return, and the legitimacy it lended to the People's Party, the King demanded several constitutional reforms.  This included the right to select half of the legislature, control over the royal budget, and veto power that could be overridden only by a 3/4's majority of the legislature.  The King also demanded the right to try capital cases, in this case, to free rebel soldiers.  At the time, the [[New York Times]] reported that the King also threatened to sell the throne's substantial assets, including land, palaces, and the [[Emerald Buddha]].<ref>The New York Times, 22 January 1935, cited in Paul M. Handley, "The King Never Smiles" Yale University Press: 2006, page 53, ISBN 0-300-10682-3</ref>  The People's Party rejected the ultimatum, and in March 1935, Prajadhipok abdicated.

Direct democratic elections for half of the People's Assembly were first held in [[7 November]] [[1937]].<ref name="Albritton" />  Women had the [[Universal suffrage|right to vote and stand for elections]].<!-- A Thai language reference for this can be found at http://www.geocities.com/pbanomyong/roles_th1.html.  I don't think this is a controversial fact, so I'll keep it in the article.  If somebody finds an English language reference for this, please add it in.-->

==1946 Constitution==
After the end of the [[World War II]], the [[Collaborationism|collaborationist]] leadership (including Marshal Plaek) was arrested and tried for [[war crimes]], democratic elections for the entire People's Assembly were first held, and the young King [[Ananda Mahidol]] returned to Thailand for the first time in 7 years.  King Ananda Mahidol had just come of age, turning 20 in September 1945, and returned with his [[Sangwal|mother]] and Prince [[Bhumibol]] in December 1945.  

A new constitution, Thailand<U+2019>s most democratic to date, was drafted in his honor.<ref name="Chambers">Paul Chambers, [http://www.kpi.ac.th/kpi/en/res_good_gov.htm Good governance, political stability, and constitutionalism in Thailand 2002: The state of democratic consolidation five years after the implementation of the 1997 constitution], King Prajadhipok<U+2019>s Institute, 10 August 2002</ref>  One key difference with previous constitutions was that the House of Representatives would, for the first time, be fully elected by the people.  A Senate was also established, which would, unlike the British [[House of Lords]], be elected by the House for 6 year terms.  In addition, active civil servants and soldiers were banned from serving in the Parliament or Cabinet, thus reducing the power of the military.  A ban on senior princes from participating in electoral politics was repealed, thus precluding only the King and four other people from politics.<ref name="Handley" />

The Constitution was promulgated in [[9 May]] [[1946]].  One month later, in [[9 June]] [[1946]], the King was found shot to death.  His death was soon followed by a military uprising that abrogated the 1946 constitution.

==1947 Charter==
The military [[coup|overthrew]] the elected government of Admiral [[Thamrong Navasavat]] in [[8 November]] [[1947]], amid the political chaos that followed the official finding that the [[Ananda Mahidol#A mysterious death|mysterious death]] of King [[Ananda Mahidol]] was not due to suicide.  The coup restored power to Marshal Plaek, and was supported by [[Phin Choonhavan]], [[Seni Pramoj]], and the palace.  The coup leaders alleged that government corruption had demeaned the sacredness of King Ananda's 1946 Constitution, as proven by the appearance of vultures at the [[Sanam Luang|royal cremation ground]].  Vultures had also appeared in [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]] before it fell to the [[Bamar|Burmese]], and this was used as justification for the military's coup.<ref>The Bangkok Post, 5 April 1948</ref>

The Regent, Prince [[Rangsit Prayoonsak|Rangsit]] officially accepted the coup within 24 hours and immediately promulated the new charter the coup leaders had drafted.<ref>The palace's complicity in the coup has been challenged, with one biographer claiming the Prince only accepted the coup at gunpoint (See Kobkua Suwannathat-Pian, "Thailand's Durable Premier", Oxford University Press: 1995, page 39).</ref>  The King, who at the time was studying in [[Lausanne]], endorsed the coup and the Charter on [[25 November]], noting "Those who were involved in this operation do not desire power for their own good, but aim only to strengthen the new government which will administer for the prosperity of the nation and for the elimination of all the ills suffered presently."<ref>Kobkua Suwannathat-Pian, "Thailand's Durable Premier", Oxford University Press: 1995, page 39</ref>

The new charter gave the palace a persistent demand: a permanent Supreme State Council to advise the monarch and handle his personal affairs.  The Council would be composed of 5 members, appointed by the monarch and acting as a regency council in his absence.  The palace was also given increased control over its own operations, including the Royal Household, the Privy Purse, and the Royal Guards.  The King was given several emergency prerogatives, such as the ability to [[Declaration of war|declare war]] and [[martial law]].

A monarch-appointed Senate was established, and, with 100 members, equal in size to the House of Representatives.  Like previous Constitutions, the monarch still did not have an absolute veto.  However, the monarch-appointed Senate could, through a simple majority over the combined houses of Parliament, sustain a royal veto.  The ban on civil servants and soldiers from serving in Parliament and the Cabinet was removed.  Another key change stated that the policies of one government could not be altered by a succeeding government without royal approval.  A multi-member constituency system replaced the single member constituency system which had been in effect since 1932.<ref name="Chambers" />

Surprisingly, the palace rejected the slate of Senate appointees proposed by the military.  It instead filled the Senate with princes, nobles, and palace-friendly businessmen, leaving only 8 appointees from the military's slate.  With control over palace operations, the palace purged nearly 60 officials, clearing out earlier appointees from previous governments.<ref>The Bangkok Post, 18 January 1949</ref>

Khuang Aphaiwong was appointed Prime Minister, and it was agreed that a new constitution would be drafted following House elections, which occurred on [[29 January]] [[1948]].  The Seni Pramoj and Khuang Aphaiwong-led [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrats]] won a majority and appointed a Cabinet packed with palace allies.  Tension between the military and the palace increased, until in April, a group of generals met with Khuang and Prince Rangsit, successfully demanding that Khuang resign and Marshal Plaek be appointed Premier.

==1949 Constitution==

The Constitution of 1949 was promulgated on [[23 January]] [[1949]], a permanent instrument to replace the temporary 1948 Charter.  The drafting committee was headed by [[Seni Pramoj]] and dominated by royalists under the direction of Prince [[Rangsit Prayurasakdi|Rangsit]] and Prince Dhani.<ref name="Handley" />

The 1949 Constitution elevated the throne to its most powerful position since the [[Siamese coup d'<U+00E9>tat of 1932|1932 overthrow of the absolute monarchy]].<ref name="Handley" />  The Supreme Council of State was transformed into a 9-person [[Privy Council (Thailand)|Privy Council]].  For the first time, members this council would be selected by the [[Bhumibol Adulyadej|King]] alone.  A 100-member Senate would also be selected by the King alone.  The President of the Privy Council, rather than the Prime Minister, would countersign all laws.  The King's veto was strengthened, with a 2/3's vote of Parliament required to overrule it.

The King could issue his own decrees with equal authority to the government.  The King also gained the power to call for a [[plebiscite]] - the ability to amend the constitution via public referendum, bypassing Parliament and the Government.  At succession, the Privy Council would name an heir - not the Parliament.

==1952 Constitution==

On [[29 November]] [[1951]], as the King was returning to Thailand from Switzerland via ship, the military seized power from Privy Council President Dhani, abrogated the 1949 Constitution, and appointed Marshal Plaek as regent.  A single 123-member National Assembly was appointed, 103 of which were from the military or police.

The Assembly re-used the 1932 Constitution with some additional amendments, namely allowing a Privy Council rather than a Supreme Council of State and using multi-member legislative constituencies rather than single-member constituencies.<ref name="Chambers" />  Half of the legislature was appointed.  After much confrontation between the government and the palace in early 1952, the King promulgated the Constitution unchanged in [[8 March]] [[1952]].<ref name="Handley" />  Democratic elections were held for half of the legislature in March 1952; nearly all of the appointed parliamentary members were army officers.<ref>Nations Encyclopedia, Thailand - A Country Study: [http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-13696.html November 1951 Coup], Nations Encyclopedia, Based on the Country Studies Series by Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress</ref>  Legislative elections were held again in March 1957.

==1959 Charter==
On the evening of [[16 September]] [[1957]], General [[Sarit Dhanarajata]] seized power from the government of Marshal Plaek (for additional information on the [[Bhumibol Adulyadej|King's]] role in the coup, see [[Bhumibol Adulyadej#Role in Thai politics|Bhumibol Adulyadej's role in Thai politics]]).  Sarit abrogated the 1952 Constitution, abolished the National Assembly, declared martial law, and ruled via a Revolutionary Council.  Sarit and his successors deified the [[Bhumibol Adulyadej|throne]] and relied on royal sponsorship to legitimize their [[dictatorship]].

A temporary charter was promulgated in February 1959 and remained in place for 9 years, even after Sarit's death in 1964.  The charter has been called "perhaps the most repressive in Thailand<U+2019>s history."<ref name="Chambers" />  It granted the Premier near absolute power, including the authority to order summary executions.<ref>The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/06/16/Special_Report/index.php?news=Special_Report_17724553.html Sarit<U+2019>s Legacy - the original strongman], 16 June 2005</ref>  It banned political parties and called for an appointed unicameral parliament, consisting of 240 mostly military appointees.<ref name="Chambers" />  It contained only 20 articles, making it the shortest charter in Thai history.

==1968 Constitution==
General [[Thanom Kittikachorn]] succeeded Sarit as dictator of Thailand, ruling amid a rising [[Communist Party of Thailand|communist]] insurgency in Thailand and an escalating US [[Vietnam war|presence]] in [[Indochina]].  The United States provided the Thai government with a billion US dollars in [[Official development assistance|aid]], but corruption was rampant.<ref name="Handley" />  During a trip by King [[Bhumibol]] to the US, The [[Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|American anti-war movement]] pressured the US government to reduce its support for the regime.

Despite resistance from [[Thanom Kittikachorn|Thanom]], a new constitution was promulgated in [[20 June]] [[1968]].  Although democratic on the surface, the 1968 Constitution legitimized Thanom's military-dominated regime.  A bicameral Parliament was established, with an elected 219-member House and a royally-appointed 164-member Senate.  Contrary to the principles of [[parliamentary democracy]], members of the House were banned from serving in the Cabinet.  In addition, the Senate had the power to delay any legislation for up to a year, and the Senate President was the Parliament President.  King [[Bhumibol]] approved Thanom's entire slate of mostly military Senate nominees.  The new constitution also validated all legislation previously made by the regime, including the sweeping Anticommunist Act used to repress dissent.<ref name="Chambers" />

In February 1969, the first democratic elections in over a decade were held, resulting in parties aligned with Thanom winning a majority in the House.<ref name="Handley" />

==1972 Temporary Charter==
Amid rising social and political conflict, in [[17 November]] [[1971]] Thanom Kittikachorn and his deputy [[Praphas Charusathien]] overthrew their own government, dissolving Parliament and the Cabinet, declaring martial law, abrogating the Constitution, and running the Kingdom through a National Executive Council.  Thanom made himself Premier, Supreme Commander, and Foreign Minister.  Praphas made himself deputy Premier, Interior Minister, Chief of Police, Army Commander, and head of the [[Communist Suppression Operations Command]].  Declaring the coup on television, Thanom opened a letter of approval from the King presented on a gold tray.<ref>Benedict Anderson, "Withdrawal Symptoms: Social and Cultural Aspects of the October 6 Coup", Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars, July-September 1990, page 30</ref>  Along with Narong Kittikachorn (Thanom's son and Praphas's son-in-law), the regime was called that of the "Three Tyrants."

Massive protests and strikes resulted, coinciding with a [[recession]] and high [[inflation]].  A disastrous offensive against the [[Communist Party of Thailand]] (CPT) was launched.  As tensions reached a boiling point in December 1972, Thanom drafted a new charter.  Similar in many ways to Sarit's 1959 charter, it reinforced the power of the military dictatorship.  Political parties were banned, and a wholly-appointed unicameral 299-member National Legislative Assembly, 200 of which were military and police, was established.  The executive retained strong control over the legislature.<ref name="Chambers" />

==1974 Constitution==
Thanom's interim charter failed to stem opposition to the "Three Tyrants."  On [[13 October]] [[1973]], a massive 400,000 person protest took place at the [[Democracy Monument, Bangkok|Democracy Monument]]. The exact circumstances of 13 and 14 October remain controversial to this day.<ref>The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=2&id=84733&usrsess= Uprising: Narong 'is distorting history'], 31 August 2003</ref>  Late in the afternoon, King [[Bhumibol]] summoned Thanom and Praphas to the [[Chitlada Palace|Palace]], where they agreed to draft a new constitution within 12 months. As demonstrators dispersed that evening and in the next morning, the police and army began shooting at the remaining demonstrators, killing at least 70. Narong Kittikachorn personally shot into the crowds from a helicopter.<ref name="Handley" />  Amid the chaos, Thanom and Praphas resigned from their political appointments, but continued to lead the military. They ordered more troops to confront the remaining demonstrators, but were blocked by [[Krit Srivara]], Army Deputy Commander. Thanom and Narong then resigned from their military positions. The King appointed [[Sanya Dhammasakdi]], Privy Councilor, as Premier.

[[Sanya Dhammasakdi|Sanya]] appointed a constitution drafting committee consisting of Justice Minister Prakob Hutasing, [[Kukrit Pramoj]], and a number of academics. They produced a first draft by [[8 January]] [[1974]].  

There were concerns that the Thanom-appointed Parliament would be inappropriate for approving the draft. The King suggested a royally-appointed 2,347-person group, who would appoint a 299-person committee, who would nominate a 100-person Convention to scrutinize the draft.

The first draft of the drafting committee swung the balance of power to an elected legislature for the first time since 1946.  Political parties would once again be legalized. A hybrid between single-member and multiple-member constituencies was created: constituencies were once again province-wide with one MP for a population of 150,000, but a province with over 3 MPs was to be divided into two or more constituencies, each with at least 1 but not more than 3 MPs. This prevented populous provinces from dominating the legislature.<ref name="Chambers" />

The draft allowed the elected House to appoint the Senate.  A simple majority could override the royal veto. Cabinet members had to be MPs. In an unprecedented move, the drafters required a popular [[referendum]] on the draft prior to the King's approval.

The draft faced staunch opposition by royalist members of the Convention, led by [[Kasem Chatikavanich]]. A new draft was demanded, granting the executive greater power and increasing royal powers to the level granted by the 1949 Constitution. The monarch would appoint a Senate with the countersign of the Privy Council President. The royal veto could be overridden only with a 2/3's majority of the combined Parliament. Furthermore, the Senate could kill any laws by not voting on them for 6 months.  Civil servants and soldiers could not become MPs, but could form up to half of the Cabinet. The new draft would not require approval by a public referendum.

The palace added two clauses. First, in the absence of a prince, Parliament could select a princess as successor to the throne. The [[1924 Palace Law on Succession]] banned female monarchs. Second, the [[1924 Palace Law on Succession|Palace Law]] could be amended.  Previous constitutions declared the law immutable.<ref>King [[Bhumibol]] had just one son, Prince [[Vajiralongkorn]], but several daughters. The ability to amend the [[1924 Palace Law on Succession|1924 Palace Law]] allowed the King to appoint anyone he wished as successor (see Aryan, Gothan (September 15-16, 2004). [http://www.idea.int/news/upload/Nepal%20-%20Thai%20monarchy%20paper%20-%20Gothom%20Aryan.pdf Thai Monarchy] (PDF format). International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance.</ref>

The new draft was very different from the intentions of the drafting committee, and at one point, Sanya actually resigned from the Premiership, only to be pressured back into position.<ref name="Handley" />  The new draft was approved by the Convention and promulgated in [[7 October]] [[1974]]. The majority of the constitution conformed to the Convention's alternative draft.  However, the Premier, rather than the Privy Council President, was allowed to countersign the Royal Declaration appointing Senators.<ref name="Chambers" />  Legislative elections were held in January 1975, resulting in none of the 22 parties coming close to winning a majority. The Democrats, led by [[Seni Pramoj]], formed a coalition government in February 1974. The coalition was highly unstable, and was replaced in less than amonth by a [[Social Action Party (Thailand)|Social Action Party]]-led coalition which appointed [[Kukrit Pramoj]] as Premier.

==1976 Constitution==
Kukrit's coalition government was highly controversial, and governed amid escalating anti-leftist violence.  Kukrit's own house was attacked and ransacked by police in August 1975.  The palace was increasingly involved in the political maelstrom, and in January 1976, the military successfully demanded that Kukrit dissolve Parliament.  Elections were scheduled on [[14 April]].  The months leading up to the election were extremely violent.<ref>The head of the Socialist Party was assassinated, the [[Red Gaur]] attempted to bomb the headquarters of the New Force Party, and the [[Chart Thai Party]] was established with the slogan "Right Kills Left".</ref>  Seni Pramoj's Democrats won the most seats in the election, and formed a shaky coalition government.

Seni's government came under great pressure.  A bill to extend elections to local levels was passed by Parliament 149-19, but the King refused to sign the bill or return it to Parliament, effectively vetoing it.<ref>Such a refusal to either sign or reject legislation was very rare.  King Bhumibol did it again in 2005, when he refused to endorse a replacement for a disqualified Auditor-General.  As in 1976, the government did not dare to pressure him to reject the law, and simply passed over the issue.</ref>  As anti-leftist hysteria escalated, Praphas Charusathien returned shortly from exile to meet the King.  Protesting student were attacked by [[Red Gaur]] paramilitary units.  On 19 September 1976, Thanom returned and was immediately ordained as a monk at [[Wat Bovornives]].  Massive protests erupted.  The King and Queen returned from a trip to the South to visit monk Thanom, leading Seni to resign from the Premiership in protest.  His resignation was refused by Parliament, but initial attempts to reshuffle his Cabinet were blocked by the King.<ref>David Morell and Chai-Anan Samudavanija, "Political Conflict in Thailand: Reform, Reaction, Revolution", page 273</ref>  The political tension finally exploded in [[6 October]] [[1976]], when [[Village Scouts]] and [[Red Gaur]] joined with military and police to rape and massacre at least 46 students protesting at [[Thammasat University]].<ref>46 was the official deathcount, see Bryce Beemer, [http://www2.hawaii.edu/~seassa/explorations/v1n1/art6/v1n1-frame6.html Forgetting and Remembering "Hok Tulaa", the October 6 Massacre].  Students were also lynched and their bodies mutilated in front of cheering crowds</ref>  That evening, the military seized power and installed hard-line royalist [[Tanin Kraivixien]] as Premier.

The military coup was clearly endorsed by the King, who declared that it was "a manefestation of what the people clearly wanted."<ref>Andrew Turon, Jonathan Fast, and Malcolm Caldwell, eds. "Thailand: Roots of Conflict", Spokesman: 1978, page 91</ref>

The new constitution, promulgated on 1976, gave the Premier near absolute powers, including the power of [[summary justice]].  Political parties were banned.  The King was allowed to appoint a 360-member unicameral National Assembly of bureaucrats and soldiers.  In addition, the King was granted a new prerogative, the power to introduce his own legislation directly into the assembly.<ref name="Chambers" />

Tanin made criminal cases the jurisdiction of military tribunals and gave police sweeping powers to detain people without charges for up to 6 months.  The penalty for [[lese-majeste]] was toughened and the law's scope was expanded.<ref>The original penalty was a maximum of 7 years imprisonment, but was toughened to a minimum of 3 years and a maximum of 15 years.  This harsher sentence has been retained to the current day, see Colum Murphy, "[http://www.feer.com/articles1/2006/0609/free/p023.html A Tug of War for Thailand<U+2019>s Soul]", Far Eastern Economic Review, September 2006.  As stipulated under the Constitution, [[lese-majeste]] only applied to criticism of the [[Bhumibol|King]], [[Sirikit|Queen]], [[Vajiralongkorn|Crown Prince]], and Regent.  Tanin, a former Supreme Court justice, reinterpretted this as a blanket ban against criticism of [[Bhumibol Adulyadej#Royal projects|royal development projects]], the royal institution, the [[Chakri Dynasty]], or any [[Kings of Thailand|Thai King]].  See David Streckfuss, "Kings in the Age of Nations: The Paradox of L<U+00E8>se-Majest<U+00E9> as Political Crime in Thailand", Comparative Studies in Society and History 37 (3): 445-475.</ref>  Dozens of people were charged.<ref>[[Prem Tinsulanonda]] continued Tanin's harsh interpretation of [[lese-majesty]] violations, banning critical issues of [[Newsweek]] and the [[Asian Wall Street Journal]] (23 December 1981) and jailing anyone critical of the throne.</ref>  All protests were banned (although royal rallies were allowed), the media was strictly censored, and the police scoured homes and schools to confiscate [[Censorship in Thailand|blacklisted books]].  The communist insurgency escalated to nearly a full-scale war.

Symbolically, Tanin planned to renovate the [[Democracy Monument, Bangkok|Democracy Monument]].<ref name="Handley" />  The monument, built to commemorate the constitution and the overthrow of the absolute monarchy, consisted of a gold-painted constitution atop giant offering bowls, situated in the center of the historic section of Bangkok.  Tanin wanted to replace the constitution with a huge statue of King [[Prajadhipok]].  Engineering challenges prevented this, so he instead placed the statue in front of Parliament.  As for the Democracy Monument, the government planned to demolish it.<ref>The plan was dropped after Tanin was overthrown.</ref>

==1977 Charter==

Tanin's dictatorship provoked harsh opposition, even from the military, who's slate of legislative appointees was largely rejected by Tanin.  On [[20 October]] [[1977]], the military, led by [[Kriangsak Chomanan]], overthrew Tanin's government.  The King's opposition to this can be seen from his immediate appointment of Kriangsak to his personal [[Privy Council (Thailand)|Privy Council]].  However, he did consent to signing the military's draft Charter.

The 1977 Charter was virtually the same as the 1976 Constitution.  The only key difference was that the name of the junta was changed to the National Policy Council.<ref name="Chambers" />

The new regime pledged a permanent constitution and elections in 1979.  The National Policy Council appointed only 3 of its members to the Cabinet.  Relations with communist China, Laos, and Vietnam were improved.  This foreign policy, as well as reconciliary government policies, weakened the Communist Party of Thailand and greatly reduced domestic political tensions.

Kriangsak's government continued to be snubbed by the King.  Deposed Premier Tanin was appointed to the King's [[Privy Council (Thailand)|Privy Council]].  Amnesty to protesters and students tried by the Tanin regime was denied for years.<ref name="Handley" />

==1978 Constitution==

Kriangsak drafted a more democratic constitution in 1978.  The constitution established a bicameral National Assembly, consisting of an elected 301-member House of Representatives and an appointed 225-member Senate.  The Premier, not the King, appointed the Senate.  The House could submit a motion for parliamentary debate for vote a of no-confidence.  However, the Senate could block House legislation concerning national security, the economy, the budget, and [[votes of no confidence]].  Most significantly, the Constitution created a transitory period, to end in 21 April 1983, after which military and civil servants would be banned from appointment to the Premiership and Cabinet.

House elections, for which political parties were banned, were held in April 1979, resulting in a coalition government which continued to appoint Kriangsak as Premier.  The [[oil crisis]] later caused rampant inflation, leading to Kriangsak's resignation (without a dissolution of Parliament) in February 1980.  A coalition government was formed that appointed Kriangsak's Defense Minister, Army Commander [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] as Premier.  

Prem ruled for another 8 years, never once running in an election.  He retained power despite [[Young Turks (Thailand)|several military coups]] with strong palace support.  Prem legalized political parties.<ref name="Chambers" />

In early 1983, facing the end of the constitutional transitory period in 21 April, after which he would be banned from appointment to the Premiership, Prem planned to amend the Constitution to make the transitory period permanent.  Prem's aid, Pichit Kullavanich, hinted at a military coup if the amendment was not ratified.<ref>Far Eastern Economic Review, 17 January 1983, cited in Handley (2006), page 284</ref>  The amendment faced harsh public opposition while the military itself was distracted by internal conflicts<ref>Particularly between the [[Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy]]'s Class 5 alumni (who would later form the [[National Peace Keeping Council]] in the successful 1991 coup) and Class 7 alumni (the so called "Young Turks", who led unsuccessful coups in 1981 and 1985), see Nations Encyclopedia, [http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-13787.html Thailand: Political Developments, 1980-87], Based on the Country Studies Series by the Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress.  Prem also engaged in a public conflict with his Army Commander, [[Arthit Kamlangek]]</ref>, leading to the failure of the amendment its 3rd reading on [[16 March]] [[1983]].

On [[19 March]] [[1983]], Prem dissolved Parliament and scheduled House elections on 18 April.  The new government would thus be formed under the transitory clauses, allowing Prem to continue as Premier for up to 4 more years.  Prem's plan was successful and allowed him to consolidate his power base.  Prem noted that "The armed forces will play an important role in the defense of the country, national independence, and the democratic system under the monarchy."<ref>Far Eastern Economic Review, 2 June 1983, cited in Handley (2006), page 285</ref>  

Parliament revolted again in 1986, prompting Prem to dissolve Parliament and schedule House elections in [[27 July]].  The Democrats campaigned against Prem's domination and managed to win the most seats.  But the government coalition they formed still reappointed Prem as Premier.<ref>The coalition consisted of the Democrat, Chart Thai, Social Aspiration, and Rassadorn parties.  However, an outsider, former [[Red Gaur]] leader Prachuab Suntharangkul, was given the powerful position of Interior Minister.</ref> Later, Prem's became accused of using the King's name and the military's strength as the means to retain power.<ref>Prem offered the King the title of [[Maharaja]], making him Bhumibol Adulyadej the Great.  Democrat [[Sukhumbhand Paripatra]] noted "The substance of his <nowiki>[Prem's]</nowiki> accomplishments consists of balancing one military group against another to maintain his position.  His style of leadership is one of maintaining a royalty-like aloofness from all major political problems." ([[Far Eastern Economic Review]], 4 June 1987).  A year later, frustration with the Prem/palace link led 99 well known academics and technocrats to petition the King, asking him to stop allowing Prem to use throne legitimize his rule (see [[Far Eastern Economic Review]], 16 June 1988).</ref>

Prem was finally brought down by a series of corruption scandals and the humiliating defeat of Thai troops in a border skirmish with [[Laos]].<ref>Key corruption scandals included corruption in the rewarding of royal decorations (resulting in the suicide of a close Prem aide), corruption by Cabinet Minister [[Chirayu Isarangkul]] (resulting in Chirayu's resignation; he was then appointed head of the [[Crown Property Bureau]]), and corruption involving the Army's purchase of [[Stingray Light Tank|Stingray]] tanks.</ref>  Parliament was dissolved and House elections scheduled for 24 July 1988, with Prem again not standing for election.  As in 1986, the election resulted in no single party winning enough seats to govern without a coalition.  Thousands protested in front of Prem's house against the prospect of an unelected Premier, until Prem finally announced that he would not accept the Premiership.<ref>Prem went on to the King's [[Privy Council]] and was later promoted to Privy Council President</ref> The [[Chart Thai party]], led by General [[Chatichai Choonhavan]], won the most seats in the election, and [[Chatichai Choonhavan|Chatichai]] became the new Premier.

==1991 constitutions==

In [[23 February]] [[1991]], Army Commander [[Suchinda Kraprayoon]] led the military in seizing power from the [[Chatichai Choonhavan|Chatichai]] government, abrogating the 1978 Constitution, and replacing it with a temporary charter.<ref name="Handley">Paul M. Handley, "The King Never Sleeps", Yale University Press 2006</ref>  Calling themselves the [[National Peace Keeping Council]] (NPKC), the coupmakers appointed a new unicameral National Assembly of 292 military officers and supporters, headed by [[Ukrit Mongkolnavin]].<ref name="Chambers" />  Ukrit and appointed Premier [[Anand Panyarachun]] were tasked with drafting a permanent constitution.

The drafting of a new constitution became a virtual battleground between the military and its opponents.  The military favored a position of continued strength, a larger and more powerful [[National Peace Keeping Council|NPKC]]-appointed Senate with power over an elected House, a larger [[Privy Council (Thailand)|Privy Council]], and the ability for non-elected officials to become cabinet members.  This last clause allowed an acting military leader to become Premier.  The public mobilized to protest the draft, with 50,000 people demonstrating at [[Sanam Luang]] on [[19 November]] [[1991]], the largest protest in Thailand since 1976.  The King intervened in his [[4 December]] birthday speech, urging the public to accept the draft and noting that "procedures or principles that we have imported for use are sometimes not suitable to the conditions of Thailand or the character of Thai people."<ref>Bangkok Post, "King calls for compromise on charter", 5 December 1991</ref><ref name="Handley" />  The constitution allowed [[Suchinda Kraprayoon]] to be appointed as Prime Minister, which led to a [[Black May|violent public uprising]] in May 1992 that brought down the government.

==1997 Constitution==
{{mainarticle|1997 Constitution of Thailand}}
The [[1997 Constitution of Thailand|1997 Constitution]] was widely hailed as a landmark in democratic political reform.  Promulgated in [[11 October]] [[1997]], it was the first constitution to be drafted by an elected assembly, and hence was popularly called the "People's Constitution".<ref name="Criminal Justice">Kittipong Kittayarak, [http://www.unafei.or.jp/english/pdf/PDF_rms/no60/ch06.pdf The Thai Constitution of 1997 and its Implication on Criminal Justice Reform]</ref>

===The constitution drafting process===
The "[[Black May]]" public uprising against the [[NPKC]]-dominated government that arose due to the 1991 Constitution provoked public calls for a more accountable system of government.<ref name="Thanet" />  In June 1994, the [[Prawes Wasi]]-led House Committee for Democracy Development amended the 1991 Constitution but was unable to push through significant reform.  After the collapse of the Chuan government, the 1995-1996 government of [[Banharn Silpa-archa]] amended the 1991 Constitution again in [[22 October]] [[1996]].

The 1996 amendment called for the creation of an entirely new constitution by a 99-member Constitution Drafting Assembly (CDA).  Seventy-six members would be directly elected from each province and 23 members would be selected by the Parliament.<ref name="Process2">Borwornsak Uwanno and Wayne D. Burns, [http://www.thailawforum.com/articles/constburns2.html The Thai Constitution of 1997 Sources and Process, part 2]</ref>  [[Anand Panyarachun]], PM in 1991 under the military regime, was elected as a member of the CDA and appointed Chairman of the Drafting Committee.  [[Political science|Political scientists]] and [[jurist]]s [[Chai-Anan Samudavanija]], [[Amorn Chantarasomboon]], [[Uthai Pimchaichon]], and [[Borwornsak Uwanno]] played key roles in the Assembly.  Public consultation took place on a nation-wide basis.  Some clauses, particularly the requirement that all MPs hold bachelor degrees, the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]], and decentralisation provoked strong criticism.<ref name="Process2" />  The [[Asian Economic Crisis]] of 1997 has been cited as a major impetus for the constitution's successful approval.<ref name="Criminal Justice" />

===Key features===
The 1997 Constitution has several innovations compared to previous constitutions, including
* Election reform.<ref name="Process2" />  Voting was made [[Compulsory voting|compulsory]] in order to ensure high-turn out reduce vote buying.  A [[Additional Member System|mixed electoral system]] based on [[Germany|Germany's]] was adopted for the House of Representatives.  100 members of the House are elected from party lists, and the remaining 400 are elected from single-member constituencies.  MPs were required to have a [[bachelor's degree]].  An independent [[Election Commission (Thailand)|Election Commission]] was established.
* Strengthening the executive branch.<ref name="Process2" />  A 2/5's vote of the House was required for a [[vote of no confidence]] debate against a Prime Minister.  A successful vote of no confidence required a majority of 1/2 of the House.  Only 1/5th of the House was required for a no confidence motion against an individual Minister.  These measures were aimed at increasing the stability of governments.<ref name="Process1">Borwornsak Uwanno and Wayne D. Burns, [http://www.thailawforum.com/articles/constburns1.html The Thai Constitution of 1997 Sources and Process, part 1]</ref>
* Greater separation between the executive and legislative branches.  MPs were forced to resign from the House in order to become Cabinet Ministers.
* [[Human rights]].  A plethora of human rights were explicitly recognized, including the right to [[free education]], the rights of traditional communities, and the right and duty to peacefully protest coups and other extra-constitutional means of acquiring power.<ref name="Thanet" />  The right to protest coups was banned following the 2006 coup.
* [[Decentralization]] of government, including the establishment of elected Tambol Administrative Organizations (TAOs) and Provincial Administrative Organizations (PAOs). School administration was also decentralized.
* Increased checks and balances, including new independent government agencies like the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]], the Administrative Court, the Office of the Auditor-General, the National Counter [[Political corruption|Corruption]] Commission, the [[National Human Rights Commission (Thailand)|National Human Rights Commission]], the [[Consumer protection|Consumer<U+2019>s Protection]] Organization, the [[Conservation movement|Environmental Conservation]] Organization, and an [[Ombudsman]].

===Praise and criticism===
The Constitution was highly praised for the participative process involved in its drafting, its enshrinement of human rights, and its significant advances in political reform.<ref name="Thanet" />  It was viewed as successful in fostering democratic development and increasing political stability.<ref name="KPI">Thawilwadee Bureekul and Stithorn Thananithichot, [http://www.kpi.ac.th/kpi/en/democratization.htm The Thai Constitution of 1997: Evidence of Democratization]</ref>  Its measures to politically empower and protect citizens were also praised.<ref name="Niyom">Niyom Rathamarit, [http://www.cdi.anu.edu.au/CDIwebsite_1998-2004/thailand/thailand_downloads/Niyom_ThaiUpdate%20Apr03.pdf, The 1997 Constitution: the path of reform]</ref>  The January 2001 House elections, the first House elections contested under the 1997 Constitution, were called the most open, corruption-free election in Thai history.<ref name="Albritton" />  Political parties were effectively strengthened, and the effective number of parties in the legislature fell.<ref> Allen Hicken, [http://www.aceproject.org/ero-en/topics/electoral-systems/Thailand%20Combating%20Corruption%20through%20Electoral%20Reform.doc Thailand: Combating Corruption through Electoral Reform]</ref>

Most criticism was based on the perspective that the Constitution was ''too'' effective in some of its reforms.  One of the members of the Drafting Committee, [[Amorn Chantarasomboon]], claimed that an overly strong and stable government brought on a "[[On Liberty|tyranny of the majority]]" and a "[[Elective dictatorship|parliamentary dictatorship]]."<ref>The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=11&id=97135&usrsess= "Thai Talk: Third party <U+2013> not such a wild idea], 15 April 2004</ref>  Following [[Thailand legislative election, April 2006|House elections in April 2006]], the [[Election Commission (Thailand)|Election Commissioners]] were jailed and the election results overturned by the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitunal Court]].

The constitution was also criticized for the lack of clarity with which it defines the King's role in politics (see [[Bhumibol Adulyadej#Royal powers|Royal powers]] and [[Thailand political crisis 2005-2006#Opposition demand for royal intervention|2006 demand for royal intervention]]).  The Senate's role in scrutinizing [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]] appointments came under much criticism (see [[Constitutional Court of Thailand#Appointment of the first Constitutional Court|Appointment of the first Constitutional Court]]).  Although the Senate was supposed to be non-partisan, [[block-voting]] became common.<ref>Xinhua, [http://english.people.com.cn/200604/21/eng20060421_260158.html New Senate election casts shadow on political prospect in Thailand]</ref><ref name="Duncan" />  A [[constitutional crisis]] almost occurred following [[Thailand legislative election, April 2006|April 2006 House elections]] (see [[Thailand political crisis 2005-2006#April 2006 House election results|April 2006 House election results]]).  Governments were criticized for politicizing appointments to independent agencies.<ref name="Duncan">Duncan McCargo, Countries at the Crossroads 2006, [http://www.freedomhouse.org/modules/publications/ccr/modPrintVersion.cfm?edition=0&ccrpage=8&ccrcountry=101 Country Report - Thailand], Freedom House</ref>

==2006 Interim Constitution ==
{{mainarticle|2006 Interim Constitution of Thailand}}
===September 2006 Thailand coup===
{{mainarticle|September 2006 Thailand coup}}
On the evening of [[19 September]] [[2006]], less than a month before [[Thailand legislative election, October 2006|scheduled nation-wide House elections]], the Thai military led a [[September 2006 Thailand coup|coup]] against the government of [[Thaksin Shinawatra]].  The [[CDRM|military junta]] abrogated the [[1997 Constitution of Thailand|1997 Constitution]], suspended the [[National Assembly of Thailand|Parliament]], [[2006 Thailand coup d'<U+00E9>tat#Restrictions on political meetings and political parties|banned demonstrations and political activities]], [[2006 Thailand coup d'<U+00E9>tat#Restrictions on broadcasting and the press|censored the media]], and dissolved the [[Constitutional Court (Thailand)|Constitutional Court]], [[National Human Rights Commission (Thailand)|National Human Rights Commission]] and other agencies created by the [[1997 Constitution of Thailand|1997 Constitution]].  For the first weeks, the junta ruled by decree.

[[International reactions to the 2006 Thailand coup d'<U+00E9>tat|International condemnation]] and several [[Public disapproval and protest of the 2006 Thailand coup d'<U+00E9>tat|local protests]] against the coup were conducted, despite the junta's ban.  In subsequent weeks, condemnation of the coup transformed into criticism of the junta-appointed government of General [[Surayud Chulanont]] and the constitution drafting process.

===The drafting process===
The junta appointed a legal panel to draft an interim charter (later officially called a "constitution").  The team was led by former Senate speaker [[Meechai Ruchuphan]], and originally included jurists [[Borwornsak Uwanno]] and [[Wissanu Krea-ngam]].  Both had played key roles in drafting the 1997 Constitution and had served under the deposed government, although they had resigned several months before the coup.  Both resigned from the panel after public criticism that they were members of the ''[[ancien r<U+00E9>gime]]''.  [[Thammasat University]] vice-rector [[Prinya Thewanaruemitkul]] harshly criticized the two, saying that they were "not honourable enough to look after the democratic system."  Both refused to play any further role with the [[CDRM|military junta]].<ref>The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/27/headlines/headlines_30014763.php Wissanu, Borwornsak withdraw from team], 27 September 2006</ref><ref>The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/24/pda/national_30014501.html Restore basic civil rights, NGOs urge], 24 September 2006</ref>

===Key features and criticism===
A draft of the interim charter was released on 27 September 2006, to much criticism.  The drafter interim charter allowed the junta, which would be transformed into a permanent [[Council for National Security]] (CNS), to appoint an extremely powerful executive branch.  The junta would also appoint a 250-member unicameral legislature.<ref>The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/28/politics/politics_30014851.php Draft charter criticised], 28 September 2006</ref>  Other major concerns included:
* The lack of controls for the drafting of a permanent constitution.  The CNS would appoint a 2,000-member National People's Assembly which would select 200 of its members to be candidates for the Constitution Drafting Assembly.  The CNS would select 100 of those candidates for royal appointment to the Assembly; it would also select the Assembly head.  The Assembly would then appoint 25 of its members as constitution writers, with the CNS directly appointing 10 writers.  This process effectively gave the junta complete control over the drafting of the permanent constitution.
* The use of an old charter if the permanent constitution was not completed by a CNS-set deadline.  The specific charter to revert to was not specified - the CNS and the Cabinet would choose which of Thailand's 16 previous charters to use.
* The lack of a clear timeline for a permanent constitution.
* The inclusion of King Bhumibol's theory of a [[self-sufficient economy]] in the preamble.
* The granting of legal authority for the junta's post-coup announcements and orders, including bans against demonstrations and political activities (Article 36).
* The granting of amnesty to the junta for executing the coup (Article 37).
* The inability of the public to file comments on parliamentary bills.<ref>The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/27/headlines/headlines_30014776.php Interim charter draft], 27 September 2006</ref>

The draft's content as well as drafting process met with much public criticism.<ref>The Bangkok Post, [http://www.bangkokpost.com/News/28Sep2006_news10.php Draft charter loopholes can 'resurrect Thaksin regime'], 28 September 2006</ref><ref>The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015004 Law lecturers attack interim charter], 30 September 2006</ref>  However, the interim charter did call for one democratic innovation: it required that a permanent constitution would have to be ratified by public referendum.  Nonetheless, the referendum proposal too was condemned, as the junta would have complete authority to propose a permanent alternative constitution if the draft were to be rejected.<ref>Asian Human Rights Commission, [http://www.ahrchk.net/statements/mainfile.php/2006statements/765/ THAILAND: MILITARY COUP - Constitutional fictions], 9 October 2006</ref> 

The draft interim charter was promulgated unchanged on [[1 October]] [[2006]].

==Post-2006 permanent constitution==
{{main article|2007 Constitution of Thailand}}
The 2006 Interim Constitution specified the terms and conditions for the drafting of a [[Next constitution of Thailand|permanent constitution]].  Most of the 2,000 members of the National People's Assembly had been approved by King [[Bhumibol]] by December 2006.  They included [[Bancherd Singkhaneti]], former Justice Permanent Secretary Thong-thong Chantharangsu, and former senators [[Chirmsak Pinthong]], and [[Karun Sai-ngarm]].

==Etymology==
The word "constitution" in [[Thai language|Thai]] (<U+0E23><U+0E31><U+0E10><U+0E18><U+0E23><U+0E23><U+0E21><U+0E19><U+0E39><U+0E0D>; ratha thama noon) can literally be translated as "rule of the state with [[dharma]]" or "charter for the rule of the state".
