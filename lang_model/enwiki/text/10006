"'''Hold Me Tight'''" is a [[Beatles]] song from their 1963 album ''[[With The Beatles]]''.  It was first recorded during the ''[[Please Please Me]]'' album session, but not selected for inclusion{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=24}} and re-recorded for their second album.

==History==
"Hold Me Tight" was composed principally by [[Paul McCartney]] in 1961, and was part of The Beatles' stage act until 1963.{{sfn|Harry|2000|pp=524<U+2013>525}}{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=71}} In their book ''[[The Beatles: An Illustrated Record]]'', [[Roy Carr]] and [[Tony Tyler]] call it the album's poorest track, saying it "fails because McCartney's vision of the complete tune obviously sagged somewhat, and his distressingly out-of-tune singing became quite embarrassing after only a few bars."{{sfn|Carr|Tyler|1975|p=24}}

Indeed, both McCartney and [[John Lennon]] had, at one time or another, shared their distaste for the song, and in a 1980s interview with [[Mark Lewisohn]] in ''The Beatles Recording Sessions'', McCartney says, "I can't remember much about that one.  Certain songs were just 'work' songs, you haven't got much memory of them. That's one of them."{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=10}} In Barry Miles' ''Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now'', the songwriter calls it "a failed attempt at a single which then became an acceptable album filler."{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=83}}

However, [[Ian MacDonald]] redeems it in his book ''Revolution in the Head'', in which he writes: "Play it loud with the bass boosted, and you have an overwhelming motoric rocker strongly redolent of the band's live sound."{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=72}}

McCartney wrote a different song called "Hold Me Tight" for a medley included on his 1973 solo album ''[[Red Rose Speedway]]''.
