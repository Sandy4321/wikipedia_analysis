'''Churubusco''' is a neighbourhood of [[Mexico City]]. Under the current territorial division of the  [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Mexican Federal District|Federal District]], it is a part of the borough ''(delegaci<U+00F3>n)'' of [[Coyoac<U+00E1>n]]. It is centred around the former [[Franciscan]] [[monastery]] ''(ex convento de Churubusco)'' at {{coor dms|19|21|20|N|99|8|55|W|}}. 

The name "Churubusco" is the interpretation the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s gave to the original [[Nahuatl]] name ''Huitzilopochco'' &ndash; meaning "place (or temple) of [[Huitzilopochtli]]". Earlier attested forms that the adapted name took include Huycholopuzco, Ocholopusco, Ochoroposco, Uchilubusco, and Chulibusco. 

==History==

===11th century===
The first settlers are believed to have arrived in the area, possibly fleeing the fall of the [[Toltec|Toltec Empire]].

===15th century===

Huitzilopochco existed as an independent lordship within [[Tenochtitlan|Mexico-Tenochtitlan]]. Its first ruler was [[Huitzilatzin]], a grandson of [[Huitzil<U+00ED>huitl]], the second ''[[Hueyi Tlatoani]]'' (the Aztec "emperor").  
Its population numbered some 15,000, dedicated to the cultivation of fruit and flowers and the extraction of salt from the neighbouring [[Lake Texcoco]]. 

A [[temple]] (''teocalli'') dedicated to the worship of [[Huitzilopochtli]] stood at a location known as Teopanzolco. Within the [[Aztec|Aztec Empire]], this ''teocalli'' ranked second only to the one at the [[Templo Mayor]] in Mexico-Tenochtitlan (some 10 km to the north). Huitzilopochco was famous for the [[hummingbird]] feathers (sacred to Huitzilopochtli) that it sent in tribute to the capital. 

===16th century===

In [[1503]], [[Ahuitzotl]], the eighth Tlatoani, connected a nearby spring to the Mexico-Tenochtitlan water supply. This is believed to have been the direct cause of the great flood of that year that devastated the city and claimed hundreds of lives &ndash; including that of Ahuitzotl.

During [[Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s]]'s siege of Mexico-Tenochtitlan in [[1521]], Huitzilopochco was razed to the ground. 
Some years later, [[Franciscan]] friars founded a small convent in the Teopanzolco district, using stones from the destroyed ''teocalli'' of Huitzilopochtli. The convent was dedicated to [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary, Queen of Angels]]. The Franciscans appear to have abandoned it shortly after; the church was transferred to the care of the regular clergy and, in [[1580]], responsibility for the convent was handed to a second group of Franciscan friars (discalced ''dieguinos).'' They rebuilt the monastery and added a novitiate and a school. 

===17th century===

In the second half of this century, thanks to the generosity of one Diego del Castillo and his wife, the monastery was completely rebuilt and much expanded.  Rededicated in [[1678]], it now consisted of an oratory, dormitories, schoolrooms, a library, a refectory, upper and lower cloisters, a dispensary and an apothecary, and an [[Andalusia]]n-style courtyard built around a well. 

===18th century===

A series of enhancements were made to the monastery and its church, including a [[churrigueresque]] altar dedicated to [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] in [[1766]] and the installation of an organ in [[1791]]. In [[1797]] an independent chapel, dedicated to [[Saint Anthony of Padua]], was erected.

===19th century===

[[Battle of Churubusco]]. On [[20 August]] [[1847]], during the [[Mexican-American War|U.S. invasion of Mexico]], a bloody and decisive battle was fought in Churubusco &ndash; specifically, in the vicinity of the monastery. 

In [[1857]], [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Ignacio Comonfort]] had a monument commemorating the heroic defence of the monastery built in front of its main gates. The remains of [[Francisco Pe<U+00F1><U+00FA><U+00F1>uri]] and [[Luis Mart<U+00ED>nez de Castro]], two army officers who led their men to perish in a desperate bayonet charge after running out of ammunition during the battle, were interred inside. 

In [[1869]], during the Reform period under  [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Benito Ju<U+00E1>rez]], the monastery was taken over by the state. It was converted into a military hospital specialising in contagious diseases.

===20th century===

In [[1917]], the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|National University]]'s Inspectorate of Artistic and Historic Monuments managed to convince the authorities that the former monastery would fare better as a museum: as a hospital, it had been more than a little neglected and was in danger of collapse. The museum was opened to the public in 1921.

With the rapid expansion of Mexico City during the mid-20th century, Churubusco ceased to be a separate village and was swallowed up by the urban sprawl of the capital. 
The motion picture production facility of [[Estudios Churubusco]] &ndash; the nerve centre of the [[Cinema of Mexico|Golden Age of Mexican Cinema]] &ndash; opened in the district in [[1945]].

===Present day===

The former monastery of Churubusco now houses the state-run "Interventions Museum" ''(Museo de las Intervenciones)'', documenting the different assaults on its territorial integrity that Mexico has suffered since declaring its [[Mexican War of Independence|independence]] in [[1810]]: [[1829]] (Spain), [[1838]] (France), [[1846]] (USA), [[1862]] (France), and [[1916]] (USA). It stands in a residential neighbourhood just outside the southernmost loop of the inner ring-road, in the middle of a pleasant, wooded plaza. 

[[Metro General Anaya]] (named for Pedro Mar<U+00ED>a Anaya) is located in the vicinity. Other nearby street names commemorating the area's history include "Calle H<U+00E9>roes del 47", "Calle 20 de Agosto", and "Calle M<U+00E1>rtires Irlandeses".
