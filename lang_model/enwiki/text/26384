'''''Gaulois''''' was a [[Charlemagne class battleship|''Charlemagne''-class]] [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] built for the [[French Navy]] in the mid-1890s. She spent most of her career assigned to the [[Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean (France)|Mediterranean Squadron]] (''Escadre de la M<U+00E9>diterran<U+00E9>e''). The ship accidentally [[Naval ram|rammed]] two other French warships early in her career, although neither was seriously damaged, nor was the ship herself. 

When [[World War I]] began, she escorted troop convoys from [[French North Africa]] to France for a month and a half. ''Gaulois'' was ordered to the [[Dardanelles]] in November 1914 to guard against a sortie into the Mediterranean by the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben}}. In 1915, she joined British ships in [[Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign|bombarding Turkish fortifications]]. She was badly damaged during one such bombardment in March and had to [[Beaching (nautical)|beach]] herself to avoid sinking. She was refloated and sent to [[Toulon]] for permanent repairs. ''Gaulois'' returned to the Dardanelles and covered the Allied evacuation in January 1916. On 27 December 1916, she was en route for the Dardanelles after a refit in France when she was torpedoed and sunk by the German [[submarine]] [[SM UB-47|''UB-47'']].

==Design and description==
''Gaulois'' was {{convert|117.7|m|ftin}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|20.26|m|ftin}}. At [[deep load]], she had a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|7.4|m|ftin}} forward and {{convert|8.4|m|ft}} aft. She displaced {{convert|10361|MT|LT}} normally, and {{convert|11325|MT|LT|-1}} at deep load.<ref name=c1>Caresse, p. 117</ref>

The ship used three 4-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple expansion steam engines]], one engine per shaft. They produced {{convert|14420|ihp|abbr=on}} during the ship's [[sea trial]]s using steam generated by 20 Belleville [[water-tube boiler]]s. ''Gaulois'' reached a top speed of {{convert|18.024|knots|lk=in}} on her trials. She carried a maximum of {{convert|1101|t|LT}} of coal which allowed her to steam for {{convert|3776|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref name=c1/>

''Gaulois'' carried her main armament of four 40-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[Canon de 305 mm Mod<U+00E8>le 1893/96 gun|Canon de 305 mm Mod<U+00E8>le 1893 gun]]s in two twin-[[gun turret]]s, one each fore and aft. The ship's secondary armament consisted of ten 45-calibre [[Canon de 138 mm Mod<U+00E8>le 1893 gun]]s, eight of which were mounted in individual [[casemate]]s and the remaining pair in [[gun shield|shielded]] mounts on the [[forecastle]] deck amidships. She also carried eight 45-calibre [[Canon de 100 mm Mod<U+00E8>le 1893 gun]]s in shielded mounts on the superstructure. The ship's anti-[[torpedo boat]] defences consisted of twenty 40-calibre [[QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss|Canon de 47 mm Mod<U+00E8>le 1885 Hotchkiss guns]], fitted in platforms on both masts, on the superstructure, and in casemates in the hull. ''Gaulois'' mounted four {{convert|450|mm|in|adj=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s, two on each [[broadside]]. Two of these were submerged, angled 20<U+00B0> from the ship's axis, and the other two were above the waterline. They were provided with twelve Mod<U+00E8>le 1892 torpedoes. As was common with ships of her generation, she was built with a plough-shaped ram.<ref>Caresse, pp. 114, 116<U+2013>17</ref>

The ''Charlemagne''-class ships carried a total of {{convert|820.7|t|LT}}<ref name=c1/> of [[Harvey armor|Harvey armour]].<ref>Chesneau and Kolesnik, p. 117</ref> They had a complete [[waterline]] [[Belt armor|armour belt]] that was {{convert|3.26|m|ftin}} high. It tapered from its maximum thickness of {{convert|400|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} to a thickness of {{convert|110|mm|in|abbr=on}} at its lower edge. The armoured [[deck (ship)|deck]] was {{convert|55|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick on the flat and was reinforced with an additional {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} plate where it angled downwards to meet the armoured belt. The main turrets were protected by {{convert|320|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} of armour and their roofs were {{convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick. Their [[barbette]]s were {{convert|270|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} thick. The outer walls of the casemates for the {{convert|138.6|mm|adj=on}} guns were 55&nbsp;mm thick and they were protected by transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} thick. The [[conning tower]] walls were {{convert|326|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} thick and its roof consisted of 50&nbsp;mm armour plates. Its communications tube was protected by armour plates {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} thick.<ref name=c1/>

==Construction and career==
''Gaulois'', named after the tribes that inhabited France during Roman times,<ref>Caresse, footnote 1, p. 116</ref> was ordered on 22 January 1895 from the Arsenal de [[Brest, France|Brest]]. Her [[sister ship]] {{ship|French battleship|Charlemagne||2}} was being built in the [[slipway]] intended for ''Gaulois'' so the latter ship's construction was delayed until the former was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]]. ''Gaulois'' was [[Keel|laid down]] on 6 January 1896 and launched on 6 October of the same year. She was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 23 October 1899 after completing her sea trials.<ref>Caresse, pp. 116, 118<U+2013>19</ref>

Together with ''Charlemagne'', the ship was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the Mediterranean Squadron and they arrived at Toulon in January 1900. Stormy weather during this voyage caused her captain to complain about her forward turret and casemates being flooded out in a [[head sea]]. The following month, while exercising in the harbour at [[Hy<U+00E8>res]], ''Gaulois'' accidentally rammed the [[destroyer]] {{ship|French destroyer|Hallebarde||2}}, gouging a {{convert|4|by|1.5|m|adj=on}} hole in the smaller ship. ''Hallebarde'' reached Toulon where she was repaired while the battleship was barely damaged. On 18 July, after combined maneouvres with the Northern Squadron (''Escadre du Nord''), the ship participated in a [[Review (disambiguation)|naval review]] conducted by the [[President of France]], [[<U+00C9>mile Loubet]], at [[Cherbourg]]. The following year, ''Gaulois'' and the Mediterranean Squadron participated in an international naval review by President Loubet in Toulon with ships from Spain, Italy and Russia.<ref>Caresse, pp. 119<U+2013>21</ref>  

[[File:Gaulois in Toulon-Agence Rol-1.jpeg|thumb|left|''Gaulois'' at anchor in 1912. Note the large [[tarpaulin]] rigged over the quarterdeck to provide shade.]] 
In October 1901, the 1st Battleship Division, under the command of [[Rear Admiral]] (''contre-amiral'') [[Leonce Caillard]], was ordered to proceed to the port of [[Mytilene]] on the island of [[Lesbos]], then owned by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After landing two companies of [[Fusiliers Marins|marines]] that occupied the major ports of the island on 7 November, [[Sultan]] [[Abdul Hamid II]] agreed to enforce contracts made with French companies and to repay loans made by French banks. The 1st Division departed Lesbos in early December and returned to Toulon. In May 1902, the ship became the flagship of [[Vice Admiral]] (''vice-amiral'') [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Fournier (naval officer)|Fran<U+00E7>ois Fournier]] who led a small delegation to celebrate the unveiling of the [[Major General Comte Jean de Rochambeau|statue]] of [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Comte de Rochambeau]] in [[Lafayette Square (Washington, D.C.)|Lafayette Square]], [[Washington, D.C.]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was received aboard on 23 May and the ship made port visits to New York City and Boston before heading back to France. She made another port visit to [[Lisbon]] before arriving back at Toulon on 14 June.<ref>Caresse, pp. 121<U+2013>22</ref>

During exercises off [[Golfe-Juan]], ''Gaulois'' accidentally rammed the battleship {{ship|French battleship|Bouvet||2}} on 31 January 1903. Neither ship was seriously damaged in the accident. In April 1904, she was one of the ships that escorted President Loubet during his state visit to Italy. Later that year, the ship made port visits in Thessaloniki and Athens with the rest of the Mediterranean Squadron. A [[wireless telegraph]] was installed aboard ''Gaulois'' in December 1905. Together with the battleships {{ship|French battleship|I<U+00E9>na||2}} and ''Bouvet'', the ship aided survivors of the April 1906 eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] in Naples. For the rest of the decade, she participated in various exercises with the Mediterranean Squadron and made a number of port visits in France and its dependencies. ''Gaulois'' was briefly transferred to the Northern Squadron in August 1910 and she participated in a large naval review by President [[Armand Falli<U+00E8>res]] off [[Cap Brun]] on 4 September 1911. The ship was reassigned to the Mediterranean Squadron in October 1912 and she participated in a naval review by President [[Raymond Poincar<U+00E9>]] on 10 June 1913. In June 1914, the Navy planned to assign ''Gaulois'' to the Training Division of the Squadron as of October, but this was cancelled upon the outbreak of war in August.<ref>Caresse, pp. 122<U+2013>28</ref>

===World War I===
[[File:Dardanelles defences 1915.png|thumb|right|300px|Turkish defenses of the Dardanelles, February<U+2013>March 1915]]
Together with the older French pre-dreadnoughts, the ship's first mission in the war was to escort troop convoys from North Africa to France. Later in September, her main turrets required repairs in [[Bizerte]] as the forward turret was having difficulty traversing. Following these repairs, ''Gaulois'' was ordered to [[Tenedos|Tenedos Island]], not far from the [[Gallipoli Peninsula]] of Turkey, in November to guard against a sortie by the German battlecruiser ''Goeben''. She relieved the battleship {{ship|French battleship|Suffren||2}} which needed a refit in Toulon. She became flagship of Rear Admiral [[<U+00C9>mile Paul Amable Gu<U+00E9>pratte|<U+00C9>mile Gu<U+00E9>pratte]] upon her arrival on 15 November. He transferred his flag back to ''Suffren'' when she returned on 10 January 1915.<ref>Caresse, p. 128</ref>

During the bombardment of 19 February, ''Gaulois'' supported ''Suffren'' as the latter ship bombarded Turkish forts covering the mouth of the [[Dardanelles]].
Late in the day, she bombarded the fort at Orhaniye Tepe on the Asiatic side of the strait. During the subsequent bombardment on 25 January, the ship anchored some {{convert|6000|m|yd}} from the Asiatic shore and engaged the forts at Kum Kale and [[Cape Helles]]. Their return fire was heavy enough to force ''Gaulois'' to up anchor before she could suppress their guns. Later in the day, she closed to within {{convert|3000|m|yd}} of the forts and engaged them with her secondary armament. During the day's action, the ship was hit twice, but these did little damage.<ref>Corbett, pp. 144, 148, 157<U+2013>59; Caresse, pp. 128<U+2013>29</ref>

On 2 March, the French squadron bombarded targets in the [[Gulf of Saros]], at the base of the Gallipoli Peninsula. Five days later, the French squadron attempted to suppress the Turkish guns while British battleships bombarded the fortifications. ''Gaulois'' was hit by a {{convert|15|cm|adj=on}} shell during this attack that caused little damage as it failed to detonate. Admiral Gu<U+00E9>pratte and his squadron returned to the Gulf of Saros on 11 March where they again bombarded Turkish fortifications.<ref>Corbett, pp. 160, 172, 192<U+2013>93, 206; Caresse, p. 129</ref>

They returned to assist in the major attack on the fortifications planned for 18 March. British ships made the initial entry into the Dardanelles, but the French ships passed through them to engage the forts at closer range. ''Gaulois'' was hit twice during this bombardment; the first shell struck the quarterdeck, but caused little damage other than deforming the deck. The second shell hit just above the waterline on the starboard bow and did little obvious damage. In reality, however, it pushed in the armour plates below the waterline and opened up a hole {{convert|7|m|ftin}} by {{convert|22|cm}} through which water flooded in. Little could be done to staunch the inflow and Captain Briard decided to head for the [[Rabbit Islands (<U+00C7>anakkale)|Rabbit Islands]], north of Tenedos, where he could beach his ship for temporary repairs. He ordered the non-essential crewmen off the ship in case she foundered en route, but managed to reach the islands, escorted by ''Charlemagne''.<ref>Caresse, pp. 129<U+2013>30</ref>

''Gaulois'' was refloated on 22 March and departed for Toulon via [[Malta]] three days later, escorted by ''Suffren''. They encountered a storm on 27 March off [[Cape Matapan]] and the ship began taking on water as the repairs began to leak under the pressure of the storm. She radioed for assistance later that night and the [[armoured cruiser]] {{ship|French armoured cruiser|Jules Ferry||2}} and three torpedo boats arrived several hours later. The ship arrived in the [[Bay of Navarin]] the following morning and more repairs were made. ''Gaulois'' arrived without further incident at Toulon on 16 April and entered drydock the following day. The Navy took the opportunity to increase her stability by lightening her masts, removing some armour from the superstructure and conning tower as well as dismounting two 100&nbsp;mm and six 47&nbsp;mm guns. In addition, the ship was fitted with a [[anti-torpedo bulge]] that stretched between her bridge and aft superstructure to increase her beam and thus her stability.<ref>Caresse, pp. 131<U+2013>32</ref>

Her repairs were completed by early June and ''Gaulois'' departed for the Dardanelles on 8 June. She reached Lemnos on 17 June and relieved her sister {{ship|French battleship|St Louis||2}} on 27 July. The ship anchored {{convert|1000|m|yd}} off the shore on 11 August to bombarded a Turkish [[artillery battery]] at [[Achi Baba]]. Splinters from return fire detonated a 100&nbsp;mm shell and started a small fire, but it was put out without much trouble. On her voyage home, ''Gaulois'' ran aground at the harbour entrance and had to unload most of her ammunition before she could be refloated on 21 August. Together with the pre-dreadnought {{ship|French battleship|R<U+00E9>publique||2}}, the ship covered the Allied evacuation from Gallipoli in January 1916. Badly in need of a refit, she sailed for Brest on 20 August where her captain argued that the range of her main armament needed to be increased by {{convert|4000|m|yd}} if she was to be considered fit for the battleline. Some thought was given to disarming her and converting her into a [[barracks ship]], but nothing was done before the ship was ordered back to the Eastern Mediterranean on 25 November.<ref>Caresse, p. 132</ref>

====Fate====
By 27 December 1916, ''Gaulois'' had reached the [[Aegean Sea]] and was off the southern coast of Greece when she was torpedoed by the submarine ''UB-47'' despite her escort of one destroyer and two armed [[fishing trawler|trawlers]]. The explosion of the single torpedo hit slightly [[wikt:abaft|abaft]] the [[mainmast]]. It killed two crewmen and another pair drowned as they attempted to abandon ship. The ship [[capsized]] 22 minutes after being hit and sank 14 minutes later off [[Cape Maleas]] at {{Coord|36|15|N|23|42|E|display=inline,title}}.<ref>Caresse, pp. 133<U+2013>34</ref>
