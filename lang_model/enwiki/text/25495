==Career==
[[Image:JohnEardsleyWilmot.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Engraving of Wilmot by [[Francesco Bartolozzi|Bartolozzi]] after Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] ]]
As a young barrister, John Eardley Wilmot was taken up by [[Charles Talbot, 1st Baron Talbot]], who was [[Lord Chancellor]] from 1733 to 1737, [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke]], the next Lord Chancellor, 1737 to 1756, and [[Dudley Ryder (judge)|Sir Dudley Ryder]], an [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] and [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]].<ref name=dnb/>  Bishop John Hough of Worcester wrote to Wilmot's aunt on 4 May 1737:<ref name=dnb/> {{cquote|I hear every body speak of your nephew Wilmot, as one of the most hopeful young gentlemen at the Bar... he may, without presumption aspire to any thing in the course of his profession; and has no small encouragement from what he has seen, since his acquaintance with Westminster-hall, in four or five of the long Robe, who have reached the top in the prime of their years.}}

He joined the Midland Circuit and was an advocate at the Derby Assizes. Dudley Ryder appointed Wilmot a junior counsel to the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]], and in 1753 he was offered promotion to [[King's Counsel]] and to [[serjeant-at-law]], but declined and returned to Derbyshire.<ref name=dnb/> However, in February 1755 he accepted the appointment as a judge of the [[King's Bench]] and serjeant-at-law, and was knighted. In 1756, he became a Commissioner of the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] and was proposed as [[Lord Chancellor]], but said he didn't want it.<ref name=dnb/>

[[William Blackstone]], author of the famous [[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] (four volumes, 1765<U+2013>1769) was one of Wilmot's close friends.<ref name=dnb/> Blackstone wrote to him on [[22 February]] [[1766]], after the publication of the first volume of the ''Commentaries'': "Sir, Lord Mansfield did me the honour to inform me, that both you and himself had been so obliging as to mark out a few of the many errors, which I am sensible are to be met with in the Book which I lately published. Nothing can flatter me so much as that you have thought it worth the pains of such a revisal."<ref name=memoirs/> 

In August 1766, Wilmot became [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]], and in September 1766 joined the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]]. In 1770, he again refused appointment as Lord Chancellor, and in January 1771 resigned as Chief Justice.<ref name=dnb/>
