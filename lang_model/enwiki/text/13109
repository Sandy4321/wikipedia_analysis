'''The Historic [[Elitch Theatre]]''' is located at the original [[Elitch Gardens]] site in northwest [[Denver, Colorado]].  Opened in 1890 it was centerpiece of the park that was the First Zoo West of Chicago.  The theatre was home to America's first, and oldest summer-stock theater from 1893 until 1987.  The first films in the West were shown there in 1896.  [[Cecil B. DeMille]] would send yearly telegrams wishing the theater another successful season, calling it "one of the cradles of American drama."

Closed in 1991.

Exterior restoration work was completed in 2007.  
Fundraising continues for interior renovations before opening to the public.

The vision is to reopen as a multimedia performing arts complex for the community offering education, film, live music, and of course theater in a year round program.

==History==
'''[[John Elitch]]''' and '''[[Mary Elitch Long]]''' first opened '''[[Elitch Gardens]]''' on May 1st 1890, with animals, bands, flowers and an open air theater where Mayor Londoner of Denver spoke.<ref>"Elitch Gardens Opens: Crowds Brave Rain," Rocky Mountain News, May 2, 1890</ref>  Inspired by {{Shakespeare]]'s [[Globe Theatre]], the first shows were [[vaudeville]] acts by accomplished local and national performers.  In 1891 Boston Opera Company performed musicals, and light opera starting with "[[The Pirates of Penzance]]."  1893 the First [[Summer Stock Theatre]] company, The Norcross Company was organized in the East and brought to the gardens.  [[Vaudeville]] shows continued until 1900.

In 1896, Edison's [[Vitascope]] was exhibited at the theatre showing the first [[film]]s in [[Colorado]].<ref>"Edison Invention At Elitch's, Rocky Mountain News, August 16, 1896</ref>

The Elitch Gardens Stock Theatre Company began performing in 1897 under the management of [[Mary Elitch Long]].  
Its first season in 1897 opened with leading man [[James O'Neill (actor)|James O'Neill]], (whose son became America's foremost playwright [[Eugene O'Neill|Eugene]]), who had promised John that he would act in the new theater when it was ready. The first show performed there was ''Helene''.<ref name="moore">Moore, John. "[http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_3713204 Famous, soon-to-be-famous crossed Elitch stage]". ''Denver Post'', April 16, 2006.</ref> The company became known for putting on ten plays in a ten-week summer season and attracting internationally known stars of the theatre and screen.

[[Sarah Bernhardt]] came to Denver in 1906 after the [[San Francisco earthquake]] destroyed the [[The California Theatre (San Francisco)]] where she was scheduled to perform. At Elitch's she played "Camille" [[The Lady of the Camellias]] at the matin<U+00E9>e and "LaSorcier" at night. [[Douglas Fairbanks]] was hired into the same company.  Prior in 1905, he was hired to sweep the stage for theater tickets.

The costs of running the park became too much for Mary Elitch, the First Woman to Manage and Own a Zoo.  With the purchase of Elitch Gardens by John Mulvihill in 1916, Mary Elitch stepped down from control of the Gardens and theater.  However two lower theater boxes were always reserved for her and her friends.  Mulvihill oversaw the theatre until his death in 1930 and was succeeded by his son-in-law Arnold Gurtler.<ref name="moore"/>  

Mary Elitch Long die at 80yrs old on July 16, 1936.  Stories of people seeing her ghost in the gardens and the theater began shortly after and continue thru today.

A fire at "The Olde Mill" ride kills six-people at the park.  The fire comes dangerously close to the historic theater.  The "Olde Mille Ride" featured 20-miles of canvas all elaborately hand painted using oil to recreate scenes for an around the world boat trip.  The fire happened eight years to the day Mary Elitch Long died.  Investigators ruled the fire to be negligence by park management.  Fire codes in Denver are drastically changed.

In 1953, the Elitch Theatre was used for two days to film scenes for [[The Glenn Miller Story]].

The Elitch Garden Theatre Company became its own incorporated business, separate from the [[Elitch Gardens]] Park, renting the theatre in 1963.  The company stopped operating as a traditional resident summer-stock switching to single, star-packaged shows out of New York.  The company had many successful years but as time and culture changed the theatre building was neglected. 

The World Famous ''Trocadero Ballroom'' was torn down in 1975.  Fearing a similar fate the community was able to add the theatre to the National Historic Registry in 1976.

The Elitch Theatre Company's last season was in 1987.  The park booked the "Amazing Acrobats of China" for a season then one night musical acts before it was officially closed theatre in 1991.  [[The Robber Bridegroom (musical)]] was performed with [[Patrick Cassidy]] for the theatre's centennial anniversary.  Actor [[Raymond Burr]] (1917-1993) raised $2-Million dollars for an educational program at the theatre.  The money is instead donated to local Cole Middle School.

The [[Elitch Gardens]] amusement park moved to the current central Platte Valley location in 1994.  The new $94-Million dollar park was opened in 1995 with attendance reaching one-million.   The original Elitch property was sold to Perry Rose in 1996 with the conditions that the theater and carrousel shell never be demolished.<ref name="moore"/><ref>Sinisi, J. Sebastian. "Landmark status urged for Elitch Theatre". ''Denver Post'', August 29, 1995: B-03</ref>  Two fires in 1995 on the old Gardens property near the theatre cause public outcry for additional security.

Non-Profit, '''The Historic Elitch Gardens Theatre Foundation''' was formed in 2002 to raise funds, maintain, preserve and restore the Elitch Gardens Theatre and carousel pavilion.<ref>"[http://denver.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2006/04/17/daily7.html Elitch Theatre announces restoration plan]". ''Denver Business Journal''. April 17, 2006</ref> In 2006, groundbreaking for the renovation of the theatre began with restoring the building's exterior, including a cement foundation for the building.<ref>Voelz Chandler, Mary.

As of 2010, the exterior restoration of the building is complete but the interior remains unrestored.<ref>Frazier, Donald. "Beyond the Lighted Stage". ''5280''. October 2010. p. 60-64.</ref> In 2011, Barbara Medill, a friend of Mary Elitch Long's, donated some of Long's possessions to the Foundation, including an engraved silver place setting.<ref>http://www.denverpost.com/theater/ci_17426495</ref>  Actress and 25yr Producer with the Elitch Theatre [[Haila Stoddard]] dies at 97.<ref>Weber, Bruce (February 25, 2011).

==Restoration==
[[File:DSC03974.JPG|thumb|250px|DSC03974|Interior of the Historic Elitch Gardens Theatre, June 2010]]
In 2006, The Historic Elitch Gardens Theatre Foundation was awarded 5-Million dollars in federal, state, city, grants and private donations.  Work began on saving and restoring the Historic exterior.  A cement foundation was poured under the exterior walls replacing beams resting on large stones on the bare ground.  The roof, gable, main entrance/lobby, and the exterior walls were all replaced and painted.  A fire suppression sprinkler system was also installed.

Interior historic restoration work is still needed.  Currently without plumbing, electrical, air condition the building needs modernizations while preserving the original woodwork and design.  Fundraising continues by the Historic Elitch Theatre Foundation to reach those goals.

In 2010 the decorative historic curtain, hand painted oil on canvas (1900s), was properly taken down and stored.  Generations of pigeons and foxes were evicted in 2011 as volunteers cleaned up after years of neglect.
