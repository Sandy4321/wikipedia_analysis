==Plot==
As [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] finds [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and his friends watching a [[pornographic film]], she becomes convinced a proper [[sex education|sex-ed]] class should be taught at his school. Since the sex-ed class at her children's school was cancelled, Lois decides to become the school's newest sex-ed teacher. In class, she attempts to teach students about [[safe sex]], but her efforts are ruined by a botched attempt of [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], who wishes to distribute his views on sex as well. Soon after the first sex-ed class, parental protests arise as Lois taught children about safe ways to perform [[premarital sex]], rather than [[abstinence]]. Lois is subsequently fired. She is replaced by a reverend who promotes both premarital and marital abstinence, explaining fictional consequences of intercourse with various questionable examples. The idea appeals to most students, including [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], who starts a relationship with fellow student Doug. Peter, truly believing the anti-sex propaganda Meg brings home, starts wearing a [[chastity belt]] and refuses to have sex with Lois. In her place, Lois grows tired of the whole ordeal, forcefully convinces Peter to change his mind and collaborates with him into sneaking into the school, after being banned, and teaching children premarital sex is okay as long as practiced safe. Following this revelation, Meg's boyfriend breaks up with her after discovering Meg's naked appearance.

In a subplot, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] loses a tooth and is told about the [[tooth fairy]]. Frightened by the fairy tale, Stewie develops a plan to capture the fairy, unknowing she does not exist. He borrows Herbert's false teeth and provokes [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]'s girlfriend Jillian to throw up, as she has [[bulimia nervosa]], in order to collect her teeth as well. Brian, overseeing Stewie's increasing obsession with the fairy, reveals to Stewie that she does not exist, but another scene shows a man named T. Fairy, having an apparent tooth [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]], stealing teeth to roll around in them.

==Production and Censorship==
Many scenes from the original episode were seen as vulgar and were removed from the television broadcast.  One of the scenes removed was from the beginning of the episode when Stewie, Chris, and his friends were watching ''Genital Hospital'', a reference to the television show ''[[General Hospital (US TV Series)|General Hospital]]''.  The original scene had included the doctor on the film undoing his zipper after discussing the patient<U+2019>s health problems.<ref name="MacFarlane">{{cite video | people=MacFarlane, Seth|date=2006|title=Family Guy season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Prick Up Your Ears"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>  Another scene removed was one in which Lois forces Peter to have regular sex, as opposed to ear sex.<ref name="MacFarlane"/> In this scene Peter refers to [[the Grimace]] as [[Ronald McDonald]]'s [[autistic]] friend. This was later changed to [[Mental retardation|retarded]] friend. A scene in which Brian informs Lois of the weird tasting [[Smuckers]] jelly in the fridge leads Peter to reveal that it had been on his genitals was also removed from the television broadcast.<ref name="MacFarlane"/> In a scene added later to the episode, [[Mel Gibson]] apologizes to the Jewish community after being offensive while continuing to offend them.
