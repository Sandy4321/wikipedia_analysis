The '''Whitney Young Memorial Bridge''' is a [[bridge]] that carries [[East Capitol Street]] across the [[Anacostia River]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Finished in 1955, it was originally called the '''East Capitol Street Bridge'''. It was renamed for civil rights activist [[Whitney Young]] in early 1974.<ref name="Bowman">Bowman, LaBarbara. "Calvert St. Span Renamed for Ellington." ''Washington Post.'' December 12, 1974.</ref><ref>Some sources say the renaming came in 1973. See: [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A1129-2005Apr19.html Kelly, John F. "Bridges Carry Bits of History Along With the Traffic."] ''Washington Post.'' April 21, 2005.</ref> The bridge is {{convert|1800|ft}} long, its six lanes are {{convert|825|ft}} wide, and it has 15 spans resting on 14 piers.<ref name="Opens" /><ref name="Shape" />

==Planning==
The need for a new bridge spanning the Anacostia River was first identified in 1949 after worsening traffic at [[Barney Circle, Washington, D.C.|Barney Circle]] led to widespread citizen complaints.<ref>"Need for 2d Span Across Anacostia Held Urgent." ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]].'' March 13, 1949.</ref> The bridge was proposed to cross the Anacostia by extending East Capitol Street over the river.<ref name="Proposed">Winship, Thomas. "Anacostia Bridge at Mass. Ave. Proposed." ''Washington Post.'' October 31, 1949.</ref> This bridge was opposed by the [[National Capital Planning Commission|National Capital Park and Planning Commission]] (NCPPC), which asked that a bridge be built by extending [[Massachusetts Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Massachusetts Avenue SE]] through the undeveloped Hill East/Reservation 13 area and connecting it with its namesake street in the [[Greenway, Washington, D.C.|Greenway]] neighborhoo on the east side of the river.<ref name="Proposed" /> The Commission was supported by an influential group of business people and civic leaders known as the Committee of 100 on the Federal City.<ref>"Massachusetts Ave. Bridge Favored by Planning Head." ''Washington Post.'' December 10, 1949.</ref> D.C. officials, however, opposed this route for fear of the negative effects it would have on nearby Gallinger Hospital (later renamed [[D.C. General Hospital]]).<ref>"Authorities Oppose Bridge at Gallinger." ''Washington Post.'' November 19, 1949.</ref> On December 29, 1940, the three [[District of Columbia home rule|D.C. Commissioners]] (then the sole government of the District of Columbia) approved a bridge at East Capitol Street.<ref>Lyons, Richard. "East Capitol St. Site Favored for Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' December 30, 1949.</ref>

But just three weeks later, the [[Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge]] opened across the Anacostia River, alleviating traffic congestion in southeast.<ref>"Young Says: Capital Span Relieves S.E. Traffic Ills." ''Washington Post.'' January 22, 1950.</ref> A few days later, the NCPPC voted to suspend approval for any new bridge across the Anacostia River until traffic patterns and congestion around the existing bridges were resolved and the need for a new span made clear.<ref>Andrews, Dorothea. "Board Vetoes Anacostia Bridge Plan." ''Washington Post.'' January 27, 1950.</ref> Federal engineers said that study would take two months.<ref>"East Capitol Bridge Decision to Wait." ''Washington Post.'' January 29, 1950.</ref> Members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from the state of [[Maryland]], whose state would be impacted by eastbound traffic from any new bridge, favored the East Capitol Street site and encouraged the D.C. Commissioners to bring the fight to Congress for resolution.<ref>"D.C. Asked to Draft Bill for E. Capitol Street Span." ''Washington Post.'' February 17, 1950.</ref> In early March 1950, the Subcommittee on District Appropriations of the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Committee on Appropriations]] turned down a request to fund a study of the Massachusetts Avenue site, and the Subcommittee on the District of Columbia of the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|House Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments]] held hearings which supported the D.C. Commissioners.<ref name="Rekindled">"Bridge Site Argument Rekindled." ''Washington Post.'' March 8, 1950.</ref> The Subcommittee on the District of Columbia estimated that reconstructing ramps and reconfiguring traffic patterns around existing bridges would cost $9.5 million, while building a new bridge would cost about the same.<ref name="Rekindled" /> Federal highway officials also testified that the bridge would help ease access to [[Maryland Route 214]], which was originally planned to connect with the [[Baltimore<U+2013>Washington Parkway]] at the District line but which had been forced into a more southerly direction.<ref>Ryan, Edward F. "E. Capitol Bridge Saves Planning Blunder, House Group Told." ''Washington Post.'' March 10, 1950.</ref> Members of Congress inspected both the Massachusetts Avenue SE and East Capitol Street sites,<ref>"Congressmen Inspect Proposed Bridge Sites." ''Washington Post.'' March 18, 1950.</ref> and the House Subcommittee approved the East Capitol span in mid-March 1950.<ref>"Bridge Confusion."  ''Washington Post.'' March 27, 1950.</ref>

A $395,000 contract studying the two sites was granted to the J.E. Greiner Co. of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], on September 9, 1950.<ref name="Contract">"Contract Let For Planning E. Capitol Span." ''Washington Post.'' September 10, 1950.</ref> The company was also asked to study whether the approaches from the west to the East Capitol Street span would travel along that street or be divided between [[Independence Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Independence Avenue SE]] and C Street NE.<ref name="Contract" /> D.C. highway officials gave their approval to the East Capitol Street span on May 1, 1950.<ref name="Approval">"City Heads Give Their Approval to Bridge Plan." ''Washington Post.'' May 2, 1951.</ref> The Greiner Co. had recommended a $2.7 million steel [[plate girder bridge]].<ref name="Approval" /> The bridge was designed to pass under Minnesota Avenue SE and the [[Baltimore and Potomac Railroad]] tracks on the east side of the river and connect with Kenilworth Avenue NE.<ref name="Approval" /> The cost of the eastern approaches was estimated at $6.7 million.<ref name="Approval" /> The western approaches would split over [[Kingman Island]] and connect Independence Avenue SE and C Street NE.<ref name="Approval" /> Work on the western approaches was estimated at $2.3 million.<ref name="Approval" /> The NCPPC approved the plan on May 10,<ref>"East Capitol Street Span Approved." ''Washington Post.'' May 11, 1951.</ref> and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] did so on August 20.<ref>"Army Clears E. Capitol St. Bridge Plans." ''Washington Post.'' August 21, 1951.</ref> But after a final site visit from the NCPPC in September 1951, the approaches were moved slightly westward.<ref>"Park Board Today Tours Bridge Site." ''Washington Post.'' September 13, 1951; "Parade Ground Gains By New Bridge Plan." ''Washington Post.'' September 14, 1951.</ref> The new approaches required dredging {{convert|650000|cuyd}} from Kingman Lake and replacing it with sand and gravel to create a gently curving peninsula that extended {{convert|800|ft}} into the western side of the lake.<ref name="Bids">"D.C. Will Ask Bids Today on E. Capitol Span." ''Washington Post.'' May 23, 1952.</ref> {{convert|1300000|cuyd}} of fill would be used to raise the peninsula {{convert|35|ft}} above the low water mark, and the western approaches built on the new land.<ref name="Bids" />

==Construction==
Bids for the entire $12 million construction project were solicited on May 23, 1952.<ref name="Bids" /> The [[Arlington, Virginia]], firm of J.A. LaPorte Inc. won the dredging contract, and the D.C. firm of Morauer & Hartzell won the fill contract.<ref name="ContractLet">"Contract Let For Bridge Approaches." ''Washington Post.'' July 9, 1952.</ref> The work was expected to take 15 months.<ref name="ContractLet" /> The NCPPC approveed the city's plans to connect the new bridge to Kenilworth Avenue NE on December 13, 1952,<ref>Zagoria, Sam. "Plans Group Unanimous In Decision On All Spans." ''Washington Post.'' December 13, 1952.</ref> and a $5.5 million plan to widen Kenwilworth Avenue into a divided, 10-lane freeway on March 24, 1953.<ref>"Kenilworth Link to Bridge Is Approved." ''Washington Post.'' March 25, 1953.</ref> D.C. officials paid $250,000 to buy the land for the exit ramps onto Kenilworth Avenue.<ref>"D.C. Will Pay $250,000 for Bridge Ramp." ''Washington Post.'' January 23, 1953.</ref> Construction on the western approaches was blocked for a month after residents of [[Suitland, Maryland]], (upset by loud trucks passing down their streets) won a month-long restraining order against the project so that contractors could devise and implement a noise-abatement program.<ref>"E. Capitol St. Span Work Blocked by Suitlanders." ''Washington Post.'' April 2, 1953.</ref>

Construction on the bridge itself began in 1953. Baltimore Contractors, Inc. won the $1.2 million contract to build the bridge's substructure, and DeLuca Davis Construction (also of Baltimore) won the $2.2 million contract to the build the superstructure.<ref name="BidsLet">"Bids Received For Anacostia River Span." ''Washington Post.'' April 11, 1953; "E. Capitol Bridge Contract Let." ''Washington Post.'' May 9, 1953.</ref> District officials sought approval from Congress to spend $4.3 million in the District of Columbia highway budget funds in September 1953.<ref name="Finish">Lyons, Richard E. "Funds to Finish E. Capitol Span Asked for 1955." ''Washington Post.'' September 10, 1953.</ref> The city also applied for $4.2 million in federal matching highway funds to help finish the bridge.<ref name="Finish" /> Driving of piles for the foundation began in December 1953.<ref name="BassettOpen" /> About 120 individuals helped construct the bridge deck.<ref name="BassettOpen" />

All the substructure and most up the superstructure had been completed by August 1954.<ref name="Shape">Bassett, Grace. "New Anacostia River Bridge Takes Shape." ''Washington Post.'' August 2, 1954.</ref> Widening of East Capitol Street east of the river was also completed in 1954.<ref name="Accomplishment">"East Capitol Street Bridge Listed as Accomplishment." ''Washington Post.'' September 11, 1954.</ref> Completion was expected in October 1955.<ref name="Shape" /><ref name="Accomplishment" /><ref name="BassettOpen">Bassett, Grace. "E. Capitol Street Bridge Open in October '55."  ''Washington Post.'' September 29, 1954.</ref> By late September 1954, 73 percent of the superstructure had been completed and only stone protections for the piers remained to be finished for the substructure.<ref name="BassettOpen" /> District transportation officials also said that ramps and overpassed for the Kenilworth Avenue exits were almost complete by this time as well, but the railroad track underpass (being built by S. Wikstrom Co.) was only 46 percent complete and not due for final work until November 1955.<ref name="BassettOpen" /> Officials said the bridge would open once Kenny Construction finished connecting the railroad underpass to East Capitol Street in the east.<ref name="BassettOpen" />

Kenny Construction began work on the final $2.3 million phase of the bridge project on November 6, 1954.<ref name="Kenny">"5th Phase Of E. Capitol Bridge Begun." ''Washington Post.'' November 7, 1954.</ref> Work was due to end in 540 days.<ref name="Kenny" /> The Greenway Apartments<U+200E> (located at 3539 A Street SE) obtained an [[injunction]] in February 1955 stopping work for a month on the project after alleging that the excavations for the road would affect the foundation of their building.<ref>"Greenway Gets Stay on Bridge Job." ''Washington Post.'' February 26, 1955.</ref>

The East Capitol Street Bridge opened on November 10, 1955.<ref name="Opens">Bassett, Grace. "E. Capitol St. Span Opened In the Rain." ''Washington Post.''

Murray drove the first vehicle across the bridge.<ref name="Opens" /> About 300 people attended the ceremony, which was held in a driving rain.<ref name="Opens" /> Also present were all three D.C. Commissioners and Rep. [[George Hyde Fallon]] (chair of the [[United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|House Committee on Public Works]]).<ref name="Opens" />

==Bridge history and renaming==
The East Capitol Street Bridge saw its first suicide when one-legged 48-year-old Adolphius L. Groom leapt from the bridge on the morning of July 13, 1967.<ref>"NE Man Dies In Bridge Leap." ''Washington Post.'' July 14, 1967.</ref> The first major accident on the bridge occurred on March 7, 1969, when two vehicles collided head-on on the span, killing two people.<ref>"2 Die, 2 Hurt In Wreck on D.C. Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' March 8, 1969.</ref> Another major crash occurred on September 18, 1971, when a vehicle on the bridge was rear-ended, killing one of the occupants.<ref>"Crash Kills SE Woman, Driver Held." ''Washington Post.'' September 19, 1971.</ref> In October 1977, a man traveling at high speed across the bridge rear-ended another automobile and died.<ref>"NE Man Fatally Injured in Crash." ''Washington Post.'' October 21, 1977.</ref> Another suicide occurred on December 16, 1986, when a man leapt from the bridge and landed on a moving vehicle below.<ref>"SE Man Fatally Injured After Fall From Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' December 17, 1986.</ref> Another traffic fatality occurred on the bridge on November 13, 1986, when a driver struck a disabled vehicle on the bridge and was himself rear-ended by a third car.<ref>Weil, Martin. "D.C. Girl Fatally Struck by Car Being Chased by Police." ''Washington Post.'' November 14, 1986.</ref> In February 1990, an ambulance taking a patient to the hospital was struck on the bridge by an automobile traveling at about 100 mph, leaving the driver and passenger in the vehicle in critical condition.<ref>"2 Hurt When Car Hits Ambulance." ''Washington Post.'' February 9, 1990.</ref>

The bridge was also the scene of a famous rape and murder in D.C. history. On October 1, 1971, Richard Anthony Lee was accused of kidnapping Robert L. Ammidown and his wife, Linda E. Ammidown; forcing them to drive to the East Capitol Street Bridge overpass above the railroad tracks; and raping and killing Linda Ammidown. Police later learned that Robert Ammidown had hired Lee to kill Linda in a plot to inherit her substantial fortune and win custody of their 12-year-old son. Four men who had learned of the plot were attempting to extort money from Ammidown. In separate trials, Judge [[John J. Sirica]] found Ammidown and Lee guilty of murder. Ammidown received a sentence of life in prison, but Lee received the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]]. Eight days after sentence was imposed, the [[United States Supreme Court]] held in ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'', 408 U.S. 238 (1972) that death penalty laws in the United States constituted [[cruel and unusual punishment]] and thus were [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. Lee's sentence was changed to life in prison. The Court later upheld new death penalty laws in ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'', 428 U.S. 153 (1976). The Ammidown/Lee trial was the last death penalty case in the District of Columbia.<ref>Milloy, Courtland. "When There's No Chance of Appeal." ''Washington Post.'' November 1, 1992; [http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/497/615/220738/ ''United States of America v. Robert Louis Ammidown'',] 497 F.2d 615 (1973, rehr'g den.).</ref> (The District of Columbia abolished the death penalty in 1981.)

A federal report in March 1972 listed the East Capitol Street Bridge as one of several "deficient" bridges needing repair in the District of Columbia.<ref name="Deficient">Lenders, Jim. "10 Bridges Called Deficient, But City Officials Disagree." ''Washington Post.'' March 8, 1972.</ref> D.C. officials disagreed with the report's conclusions, arguing they had not submitted complete data on the bridge.<ref name="Deficient" />

In early 1974, the East Capitol Street Bridge was renamed the Whitney M. Young, Jr. Memorial Bridge in honor of [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|civil rights]] activist and [[National Urban League]] Executive Director [[Whitney Young]].<ref name="Bowman" />

In 1980, District officials spent $8.5 million reconstructing the deck of the bridge.<ref>Sableman, Mark. "District Schedules $30 Million in Highway and Bridge Reconstruction." ''Washington Post.'' August 18, 1977; Feaver, Douglas B. "Facelift Planned for Bridges, Freeway." ''Washington Post.'' March 3, 1979.</ref> The bridge was carrying about 56,000 vehicles a day at that time.<ref name="Reverse">"East Capitol Bridge Lanes to Become Reversible." ''Washington Post.'' December 6, 1979.</ref> One side of the span was closed at a time, with two-way traffic proceeding on the open portion.<ref name="Reverse" />

In 1982, D.C. officials proposed building the [[11th Street Bridges#Barney Circle Freeway|Barney Circle Freeway]], which would have linked [[Interstate 695 (District of Columbia)|Interstate 695]] (which dead-ended at a junction with [[Pennsylvania Avenue|Pennsylvania Avenue SE]]) to the Whitney Young Memorial Bridge by building a six-lane freeway from Barney Circle to the bridge through [[Anacostia Park]].<ref name="Barney">Lynton, Stephen J. "D.C. Plans to Link Two City Freeways." ''Washington Post.'' September 26, 1983; Lynton, Stephen J. "D.C. Reviving Long-Controversial Anacostia Road Plan." ''Washington Post.'' July 7, 1985.</ref> The plan would also have built a new bridge across the Anacostia River from Barney Circle to connect with the [[Interstate 295 (District of Columbia)|Anacostia Freeway]] near E Street SE.<ref name="Barney" /> After numerous delays and strong citizen opposition, the Barnery Circle Freeway project was cancelled in 1997.<ref>Harris, Hamil R. "Barney Circle Freeway Controversy Flares Anew." ''Washington Post.'' November 7, 1996; [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/library/growth/transport/barney.htm Loeb, Vernon. "Norton Declares Barney Circle Freeway a Dead End."] ''Washington Post.'' March 5, 1997.</ref>

The bridge continued to have work done as it neared a half century of use. In 1996, the last year the city collected traffic data on the structure, 66,200 vehicles per day used the bridge.<ref name="NBIData" /> The roadway's condition was noticeably rough in 1997.<ref>Shaffer, Ron. "Did Virginia DMV Do Him Wrong?" ''Washington Post.'' August 6, 1997.</ref> In 2004, the District of Columbia resurfaced the deck and made repairs to three piers at a cost of $3.4 million.<ref>"What's Going Where?" ''Washington Post.'' May 27, 2004.</ref> In 2009, the [[Federal Highway Administration]]'s [[National Bridge Inventory]] rated the bridge as "not deficient."<ref name="NBIData" /> The [[District of Columbia Department of Transportation]] estimated that by 2015, the bridge would be carrying only about 60,000 vehicles per day<U+2014>about 10 percent fewer than in 2009.<ref name="NBIData" />
