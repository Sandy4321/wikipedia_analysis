The third '''HMS ''Windsor'' (D42)'''  was a [[V and W class destroyer|W-class]] [[destroyer]] of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]] that saw service in the final months of [[World War I]] and in [[World War II]].

==Construction and commissioning==
''Windsor'' was ordered on 9 December 1916<ref name="navalhistory"/> and was [[Keel laying|laid down]] by [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company]] at [[Greenock]], [[Scotland]],<ref name="navalhistory"/> in April 1917. [[Ship naming and launching|Launched]] on 21 June 1918,<ref name="navalhistory"/> she was completed on 28 August 1918<ref name="navalhistory"/> and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] the same day.<ref name="uboatnet"/> She was assigned the [[pennant number]] F12 in September 1918;<ref name="navalhistorywwi"/> it was changed to D42 during the interwar period.<ref name="navalhistory"/>

==Service history==
===World War I===
Upon completion, ''Windsor'' was assigned to the [[Grand Fleet]], based at [[Scapa Flow]] in the [[Orkney Islands]], in which she served for the rest of World War I. She was present at the surrender of the [[Imperial German Navy]]{{'}}s [[High Seas Fleet]] in November 1918.<ref name="navalhistorywwi"/>

===Interwar===
''Windsor'' was assigned to the 6th Destroyer [[Flotilla]] in the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] in 1921. In 1928 she was part of the [[Portsmouth]] Local Flotilla.<ref name="navalhistory"/>

===World War II===
====1939<U+2013>1940====
On the day the United Kingdom entered [[World War II]], 3 September 1939, ''Windsor'' was assigned to the 18th Destroyer [[Flotilla]] at [[Portland Harbour|Portland]], [[England]], for [[convoy]] escort and patrol duty in the [[English Channel]] and [[Southwestern Approaches]]. In October 1939 she transferred to [[Western Approaches Command]] but continued her assignment in the Southwestern Approaches. By January 1940, she was based at [[Plymouth]] for these duties.  On 11 March 1940, she and the destroyer {{HMS|Winchelsea|D46}} relieved two French warships as the escort of [[Convoy HG 21]] as it arrived in the Southwestern Approaches from [[Gibraltar]] and escorted the convoy until the conclusion of its voyage at [[Liverpool]] on 13 March 1940.<ref name="navalhistory"/>

In May 1940, ''Windsor'' transferred to the 19th Destroyer Flotilla at [[Dover]] and was assigned to the support of military operations opposing the highly successful [[Battle of France|German offensive]] into [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Luxembourg]] that began that month.<ref name="navalhistory"/> On the evening of 13 May 1940, she evacuated the [[Government of the Netherlands]] from the [[Hook of Holland]].<ref name="navalhistory"/><ref name="uboatnet"/> On 23 May 1940, she and the destroyer {{HMS|Venetia|D53}} patrolled off [[Boulogne]], France, and engaged troops and tanks of the [[German Army]]{{'}}s [[2nd Panzer Division]] that were [[Battle of Boulogne (1940)|attacking the port]];<ref name="navalhistory"/> ''Windsor'' entered the port that evening and evacuated British troops trapped there by the German advance.<ref name="Dunkirk">[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZM71HK2ysoAC&pg=PA208&lpg=PA208&dq=hms+venetia&source=bl&ots=KTTRXratNu&sig=TR3u6aY8Zo69tQwFPQ3ZuMbK_8s&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8kWMUdSYMomuqQGJ8oHYCA&sqi=2&ved=0CIEBEOgBMAw#v=onepage&q=hms%20windsor&f=false Sebag-Montefiore, Hugh, ''Dunkirk: Fight To the Last Man'', Harvard University Press, 2006, p. 210.]</ref>

On 26 May 1940, ''Windsor'' was assigned to [[Operation Dynamo]], the [[Evacuation of Dunkirk|evacuation]] of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops from [[Dunkirk]], France. She began support operations on 27 May 1940, patrolling off the Dunkirk beachhead and escorting ships engaged in evacuating personnel from it. That day she came to the assistance of the [[passenger ship]] ''Mona{{'}}s Isle'', which had come under German air attack with 1,000 troops from Dunkirk on board, suffering 23 dead and 60 wounded; after rendering medical assistance to ''Mona{{'}}s Isle'', ''Windsor'' escorted her to Dover. On 28 May, ''Windsor'' herself came under a heavy and sustained attack by 15 German aircraft, which bombed and [[Strafing|strafed]] her, inflicting 30 casualties on her crew and causing significant damage, forcing her to return to Dover. Despite her damage, however, she remained in action, evacuating 606 troops from Dunkirk on 30 May, 658 troops on one trip and 588 troops on a second trip on 31 May, 493 troops on 1 June, and 644 troops in two voyages on 2 June. She made her final evacuation trip on 3 June, transporting 1,022 troops and bringing to 3,991 the number of troops she had evacuated from Dunkirk.<ref name="navalhistory"/>

''Windsor'' proceeded to Liverpool on 4 June 1940 for repairs and a refit, and her pennant number was changed to I42.<ref name="navalhistory"/> After the completion of repairs, she and the destroyer {{HMS|Vesper|D55}} on 1 July 1940 rescued 111 survivors of the British [[merchant ship]] ''Beignon'', which the German [[submarine]] [[German submarine U-30 (1936)|''U-30'']] had [[torpedo]]ed and sunk in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]] 300 [[nautical mile]]s (556 km) west of [[Ushant]] at {{coord|47|20|00|N|010|30|00|W|name=''Beignon'' sunk}}.<ref name="uboatnet"/>

Later in July 1940, ''Windsor'' was assigned along with the [[destroyer leader]] {{HMS|Montrose|D01}} and the destroyers {{HMS|Walpole|D41}}, and {{HMS|Whitshed|D77}} to the 16th Destroyer Flotilla at [[Harwich]] for convoy escort and patrol duty in the [[North Sea]].<ref name="navalhistory"/> On 28 October 1940, ''Windsor'' towed ''Walpole'' to [[Sheerness]] after ''Walpole'' detonated a [[magnetic mine]] and became disabled.<ref name="uboatnet"/> On 8 December 1940, ''Windsor'' herself struck a [[naval mine]] off [[Aldeburgh]], [[Suffolk]], and she entered [[Chatham Dockyard]] for repairs.<ref name="uboatnet"/>

====1941<U+2013>1942====
''Windsor''{{'}}s repairs were completed on 24 April 1941.<ref name="uboatnet"/> In May 1941, she detached from her North Sea duties for service with the [[Home Fleet]] at [[Scapa Flow]] in the [[Orkney Islands]]. During her time with the Home Fleet, she escorted major warships during exercises in the [[Northwestern Approaches]]; on 17 May 1941, she and ''Walpole'' escorted the [[battleship]] {{HMS|King George V|41|6}} during a [[Gun|gunnery]] exercise.<ref name="navalhistory"/>

''Windsor'' returned to the 16th Destroyer Flotilla at Harwich in July 1941 and resumed her North Sea convoy and patrol duties. By January 1942, these duties had begun to include operations to intercept German [[motor torpedo boat]]s <U+2013> S-boats, known to the Allies as "[[E-boat]]s" <U+2013> in the North Sea before they could mount attacks against Allied ships. On 13 March 1942, she, ''Walpole'', and the escort destroyers {{HMS|Blencathra|L24}}, {{HMS|Calpe|L71}}, and {{HMS|Fernie|L11}} deployed in the English Channel to intercept the German [[merchant raider]] [[German auxiliary cruiser Michel|''Michel'']] during ''Michel''{{'}}s voyage <U+2013> under escort by five [[torpedo boat]]s and nine [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]] <U+2013> from [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]] in the Netherlands to German-occupied France; ''Windsor'' exchanged gunfire with the German ships on 14 March and made a torpedo attack against them, sustaining superficial damage from the German gunfire. She then returned to convoy and patrol duty in the North Sea and English Channel.<ref name="navalhistory"/>

In August 1942, ''Windsor'', ''Montrose'', ''Walpole'', and the destroyer {{HMS|Worcester|D96}} detached for duty with the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow and deployed in the Northwestern Approaches to escort major warships of the Home Fleet and conduct [[antisubmarine]] patrols. In September 1942, ''Windsor'' was assigned to support the passage of the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] [[Convoy PQ 18|PQ 18]] and [[Convoy QP 14|QP 14]] during their voyages to and from the [[Soviet Union]], respectively. On 8 September 1942, she joined the escort of PQ 18, but on 9 September she detached from the convoy to form Force P, consisting of ''Windsor'', the escort destroyers {{HMS|Cowdray|L52}} and {{HMS|Oakley|L72}}, and the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]] [[RFA Blue Ranger (A157)|RFA ''Blue Ranger'' (A157)]] and [[RFA Oligarch|RFA ''Oligarch'']]. Force P proceeded to [[Lowe Sound]] at [[Spitsbergen]] to establish a refuelling base. ''Windsor'' operated as a [[guard ship]] there from 12 September until 21 September 1942, when refuelling operations were complete and she departed for [[Iceland]]. On 26 September, she departed Iceland to return to her North Sea convoy and patrol duties with the 16th Destroyer Flotilla.<ref name="navalhistory"/>

After spending the autumn of 1942 in North Sea operations, ''Windsor'' again detached in December 1942 for a tour of duty with the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow.<ref name="navalhistory"/>

During 1942, the Urban District of [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] in [[Berkshire]] "adopted" ''Windsor'' as the result of a [[Warship Week]] National Savings campaign.<ref name="navalhistory"/>

====1943<U+2013>1945====
In January 1943, ''Windsor'' continued her deployment with the Home Fleet, operating in the Northwestern Approaches. Later in the month, she returned to her North Sea duties with the 16th Destroyer Flotilla, and on 24 January 1943 she and the escort destroyer {{HMS|Mendip|L60}} drove off a German E-boat attack against a convoy they were escorting in the North Sea. On 4 March 1943, ''Windsor'', the escort destroyer {{HMS|Southdown|L25}}, and the [[corvette]] {{HMS|Sheldrake|L06}} fought an action against E-boats off [[Great Yarmouth]]. ''Windsor'' joined ''Blencathra'' and the motor [[gunboat]]s {{HMS|MGB 321}} and {{HMS|MGB 333}} in driving off an attack by E-boats against [[Convoy FS 1074]] off [[Smith's Knoll]] on 28 March 1943.<ref name="navalhistory"/>

''Windsor'' continued her escort and patrol operations in the North Sea until May 1944, when the Royal Navy assigned her to support of the upcoming Allied [[Invasion of Normandy|invasion]] of [[Normandy]], scheduled for early June 1944. Accordingly, she joined the corvette {{HMS|Starwort|K20}} and two motor [[Launch (boat)|launches]] of the Royal Navy [[Coastal Forces of the Royal Navy|Coastal Forces]] off [[Southend]] in early June 1944 to form Escort Group 132, assigned to escort Convoy ETC2Y, which consisted of 13 [[Coastal trading vessel|coasters]] carrying pre-loaded British transports as well as five water tankers and 10 [[oil tanker]]s. On 4 June 1944, the convoy and its escorts moved from the [[Thames Estuary]] to the [[Solent]], where the corvette {{HMS|Buttercup|K193}} and a [[BYMS-class minesweeper|motor minesweeper]] joined the escort. The invasion was postponed from 5 to 6 June 1944 due to bad weather, but on 7 June, the day after the initial landings, the convoy arrived off the invasion beaches to discharge its cargo, then returned to the [[Nore]] later in the day to begin a convoying cycle supporting the build-up of Allied forces and supplies in Normandy. From 8 June until later in the month, ''Windsor'' escorted convoys between England and the beachhead.<ref name="navalhistory"/>

In July 1944, ''Windsor'' returned to patrol and escort duty in the North Sea, which she continued until the [[surrender of Germany]] in early May 1945.<ref name="navalhistory"/>

==Decommissioning and disposal==
During the summer of 1945, ''Windsor'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]], transferred to the [[Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom)|Reserve Fleet]], and placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]],<ref name="navalhistory"/> no longer being listed on the Royal Navy{{'}}s active list by July 1945.<ref name="uboatnet"/> After the [[surrender of Japan]] on 15 August 1945, ''Windsor'' was placed on the disposal list.<ref name="navalhistory"/> She was sold on 4 March 1947<ref name="navalhistorywwi"/> to [[Metal Industries, Limited|Metal Industries]] for scrapping, arrived under tow at the shipbreaker{{'}}s yard in [[Charlestown, Fife|Charlestown]], [[Fife]], Scotland, in May 1949,<ref name="navalhistory"/> and was scrapped in June 1949.<ref name="navalhistorywwi"/>
