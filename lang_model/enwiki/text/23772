"'''A Change Is Gonna Come'''" is the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 4)|fourth season]] premiere of the American television [[medical drama]] ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', and the 62nd episode of the overall series. The premiere focused on the aftermath of the main characters' promotion to [[residency (medicine)|residency]], following the conclusion of their [[internship (medicine)|internship]]. The script for the premiere was written by series creator and executive producer [[Shonda Rhimes]], while filmmaker and series veteran [[Rob Corn]] served as the director. The episode marked [[Chyler Leigh]]'s promotion to series regular status, following her guest appearances in the last two episodes of the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 3)|previous season]]. The episode also featured one-time guest actors [[Mark Pellegrino]], Stephania Childers, Sandra Thigpen, and Steven Porter.

The story arcs which provided a particular focus on individual characters include [[Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]) dealing with the aftermath of [[Preston Burke]]'s ([[Isaiah Washington]]) departure, and the dissolution of their engagement, [[Izzie Stevens]], ([[Katherine Heigl]]) struggling with her romantic feelings towards the married [[George O'Malley]] ([[T.R. Knight]]), and [[Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ramirez]]) learning to deal with her new position of Chief Resident. Also dealt with was [[Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]) coping with [[Rebecca Pope]]'s ([[Elizabeth Reaser]]) departure, and [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]) facing the conclusion of her relationship with [[Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), while dealing with the arrival of her half-sister, [[Lexie Grey]] (Leigh), who enrolls in the surgical program at the hospital.

The episode aired on September 27, 2007 in the United States on the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC), with an approximated 20.93 million viewers tuning in. Ranking second in the time-slot and third for the week, the episode garnered a 7.3 [[Nielsen ratings#rating and total viewers|Nielsen rating]] in the [[Nielsen ratings#Demographics|18<U+2013>49 demographic]], seeing a decrease from the previous episode, which received an 8.0 rating. Critical response of the episode ranged from mixed to negative, with Yang's storyline being a particular source of critical acclaim from television reviewers. Although the episode was fictionally set in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], filming occurred in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The episode was the first not to feature Washington, due to his being fired from the series at the conclusion of the third season.

== Plot ==

"A Change Is Gonna Come" opens to a voice-over narrative from [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]) about change, the episode's main theme. Following the conclusion of their [[internship (medicine)|internship]], Meredith, along with her colleagues, [[Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]), [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]), and [[Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]) commence their [[residency (medicine)|residency]] in the department of surgery, and start dealing with new responsibilities, including the new generation of interns, to whom they have been assigned as mentors. After failing his post-internship exam in the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 3)|season three]] finale, [[George O'Malley]] ([[T.R. Knight]]) must repeat his internship, in order to avoid being forced to leave the medical field. It is revealed that among the new interns is [[Lexie Grey]] ([[Chyler Leigh]]), Meredith's half-sister, who previously had an encounter with [[Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), despite his unawareness of her identity. [[Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ramirez]]), whom [[Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens, Jr.]]) chose for [[Miranda Bailey]]'s ([[Chandra Wilson]]) righteous position of Chief Resident, finds difficulty in exposing an authoritative behavior, getting no respect from her subordinates.

It is explained that, in the aftermath of her being left by [[Preston Burke]] ([[Isaiah Washington]]) at the altar, Yang spent her honeymoon travelling with Meredith. Having just returned, she is shocked to learn that Burke has resigned from Seattle Grace, and relocated to an unknown location. Stevens has to deal with her romantic feelings for O'Malley, whose marriage to Torres is being threatened by his yet to be exposed affair. O'Malley, who finds himself in the unpleasant situation of repeating his internship, quickly gains support in Lexie, who decides not to tell the fellow interns about his failed exam. Karev is revealed to have visited [[Rebecca Pope]] ([[Elizabeth Reaser]]), following her departure. In the absence of [[Addison Montgomery]] ([[Kate Walsh (actress)|Kate Walsh]]), who relocated to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Mark Sloan]] ([[Eric Dane]]) seeks reconciliation with Shepherd, formerly his closest friend and confidant. Bailey manifests a cold attitude towards Webber, in order to express her disappointment in not being considered for the position of Chief Resident, in spite of her enviable reputation among the hospital staff. Lexie meets Meredith for the first time, but is demoralized when she becomes aware of her apparent discomfort. Meredith and Shepherd encounter difficulty in being broken up, realizing that their mutual romantic feelings are an impediment in their attempt at having separate lives.

The emergency room is filled with victims from a chain car accident, one of whom is admitted in the department of [[neurosurgery]], under the care of Shepherd and Yang. As the physicians soon discover that he has been internally decapitated, they come to the conclusion that even a minor move would result in irreparable damage. A pregnant woman is admitted in [[plastic surgery]], after having her arm severed. Meredith is assigned to work for Sloan during the day, and is immediately told to find the arm, much to the fascination of her interns. Despite trying to deal with her trainees in a strict manner, Stevens is looked upon as unprofessional by the interns she was assigned to. Her image is further deteriorated when she decides to abandon her hospital duties, in order to perform surgery on a deer, once again letting her emotional involvement interfere with her career. Meredith and Shepherd discuss the repercussions of their breakup, and realize that they cannot reconcile. However, the two engage in sexual intercourse, as a manner to express their mutual feelings for the last time. O'Malley comes to the realization of his love for Stevens, and quickly discloses to her that he shares her romantic feelings.

The premiere generally received mixed to negative feedback from television critics. Debbie Chang on [[BuddyTV]] deemed the episode "dsyfunctional and ridiculous", being particularly critical of the story arc involving Stevens, whom she described as not being worthy of being promoted to the residency level.<ref name=buddy>{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/greys-anatomy/greys-anatomy-episode-41-a-cha-11638.aspx|title=Grey's Anatomy: Episode 4.1 "A Change is Gonna Come" Recap|author=Chang, Debbie|date=September 27, 2007|accessdate=October 3, 2012|work=BuddyTV|publisher=BuddyTV}}</ref> Chang expressed disagreement with the manner Bailey and Shepherd's characters were dealt with by the writers, feeling that the former's anger should have been targeted at herself, and criticizing the exaggerated exposure of the latter's "first grader emotional maturity".<ref name=buddy/> However, Yang's character was praised, with Chang choosing her manner of repressing her feelings as a highlight.<ref name=buddy/> Chang expressed a general disappointment in the episode, disapproving the choice for the episode as a season opener, a topic in regard to which she elaborated, "I  can see already that this season will continue to bring us medical cases that are so blatantly about the doctors' pathetic lives."<ref name=buddy/> In September 2009, the inclusion of the deer ranked twelfth in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'s}} "Most Memorable Cases of ''Grey's Anatomy''".<ref name=ew>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20201663_20459807,00.html#20459807|title=12.

Eileen Lulevitch, entertainment reviewer for ''[[TV Guide]]'', was generally favorable of the episode, writing, "Watching the season premiere tonight was like welcoming an old friend back into your home. It was so easy to slip back into Grey's world and get caught up in all of the amazing moments that make this show so much fun to watch. And while I expected the night to start off on a somber note, by addressing Cristina and Burke's fallout, I was pleasantly surprised by the way the attendees paid tribute to Bailey, by giving their new interns the same exact first-day speech Bailey had given them."<ref name=tvguide>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/greys-anatomy-2007/episode-1-season-4/a-change-is-gonna-come/191535|title=Grey's Anatomy Episode: "A Change Is Gonna Come" Adjust Your Expectations|publisher=TVGuide|work=TVGuide|date=September 28, 2007|accessdate=October 13, 2012}}</ref> Lulevtich praised Meredith's story arc, noting the surprising turn her character evolution has taken, as she praised Lexie's introduction.<ref name=tvguide/> While expressing a negative perspective on the writers' decision to have Torres be the Chief Resident, instead of Bailey, Lulevitch described Torres' adjustment to her new position as one of the episode's focal points.<ref name=tvguide/> Despite praising Yang's storyline in the personal background, the concept of her interaction with the patient she was assigned to was regarded as predictable and obvious, "When the man's family came to see him, and Cristina told them it could be for the very last time. It was that moment that really got Cristina thinking about how much she did in fact miss Burke, as we later learned in the episode."<ref name=tvguide/>

Former ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' columnist [[Alan Sepinwall]] expressed a negative perspective on the episode, deeming it childish and ridiculous.<ref name=sepinwall>{{cite web|url=http://sepinwall.blogspot.be/2007/09/greys-anatomy-this-is-absolutely.html|title=What's Alan Watching?

She proves her unfitness for this role with her first patient of the day, the deer. Not cute, not character-illuminating, just dumb."<ref name=sepinwall/> Also criticized was Torres, whose regression from a "cool, rocking, outgoing, cofident and full of life" role was highlighted, receiving negative feedback from Sepinwall, who wrote "Now the character exists entirely so the writers can dump on her, in a devolution far worse than anything. I just don't get it, and it pains me to watch any scene with Callie in it.<ref name=sepinwall/> Despite expressing a negative outlook on Meredith's story arc which dealt with Shepherd, noting that the "constant break-ups and reunions are as silly as if Shonda Rhimes had just kept them apart for three seasons before letting them kiss", Sepinwall was favorable of Lexie's arrival at Seattle Grace, feeling that "she's still being written as Meredith circa season one in an attempt to make us like her, but I didn't mind the manipulation, if only because there are so few characters left on this show to like."<ref name=sepinwall/> The ''Buzzsugar'' television reviewer was mainly critical of the episode, describing it as a departure from "the old show".<ref name=buzz>{{cite web|url=http://greys-anatomy-junkies.buzzsugar.com/Greys-Anatomy-Rundown-Episode-1-Change-Gonna-Come-662467|title="Grey's Anatomy" Rundown: Episode 1, "A Change is Gonna Come"|work=Buzzsugar|publisher=Buzzsugar|date=September 28, 2007|accessdate=October 1, 2012}}</ref> However, Lexie's introduction was praised in the ''Buzzsugar'' review.<ref name=buzz/>
