'''Guaran<U+00ED>''' are a group of [[culture|culturally]] related [[indigenous peoples of South America]]. They are distinguished from the related [[Tupi people|Tupi]] by their use of the [[Guaran<U+00ED> language]]. The traditional range of the Guaran<U+00ED> people is in what is now [[Paraguay]] between the [[Uruguay River]] and lower [[Paraguay River]], the [[Misiones Province|Misiones]] Province of [[Argentina]], southern [[Brazil]], and parts of [[Uruguay]] and [[Bolivia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/EthnoAtlas/Hmar/Cult_dir/Culture.7843|title=Society-GUARANI}}</ref>  Although their demographic dominance of the region has been reduced by [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonisation]] and the commensurate rise of [[mestizo]]s, there are contemporary Guaran<U+00ED> populations in these areas. Most notably, the Guarani language, still widely spoken across traditional Guaran<U+00ED> homelands, is one of the two official languages in Paraguay, the other one being Spanish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.embaparusa.gov.py/paraguay.html |title=Paraguay |publisher=Embassy of Paraguay in the United States of America}}</ref> The language was once looked down upon by the upper and middle classes, but it is now often regarded with pride and serves as a symbol of national distinctiveness.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The Paraguayan population learns Guaran<U+00ED> both informally from social interaction and formally in public schools. In modern Spanish Guaran<U+00ED> is also applied to refer to any Paraguayan national in the same way that Mexicans are labelled Aztecs and French are called Gauls.

==Name==
The history and meaning of the name ''Guaran<U+00ED>'' are subject to dispute. Prior to their encounter with Europeans, the Guaran<U+00ED> referred to themselves simply as ''Ab<U+00E1>'', meaning "men" or "people."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07045a.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia}}</ref> The term Guaran<U+00ED> was originally applied by early [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries to refer to natives who had accepted conversion to the Christian religion; ''Cayua'' or ''Caingua'' (''ka'aguygua'') was used to refer to those who had refused it. ''Cayua'' is roughly translated as "the ones from the forest". While the term Cayua is sometimes still used to refer to settlements of indigenous peoples who have not well integrated into the dominant society, the modern usage of the name Guaran<U+00ED> is generally extended to include all people of native origin regardless of societal status. Barbara Ganson writes that the name ''Guaran<U+00ED>'' was given by the Spanish as it means "warrior" in the Tupi-Guaran<U+00ED> dialect spoken there.<ref name=Ganson2003>{{Cite journal  | title = The Guarani Under Spanish Rule in the Rio de la Plata  | year = 2003  | author=Ganson, Barbara  | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==History, myth and legend==
[[File:Triunfo-25.jpg|thumb|280px|Guaran<U+00ED> incised ceramics bowls, Museum Farroupilha, in [[Triunfo]]]]
The history of the Guaran<U+00ED> people prior to contact with European explorers is not well documented. Their early history is based entirely on [[oral tradition]], since they did not have a written language. Since the Guaran<U+00ED> people were a somewhat [[nomad]]ic, decentralized society, there is little in the way of a reliable historical record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1841.htm|title=Paraguay|publisher=US Department of State}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=September 2013}}

Early Guaran<U+00ED> villages often consisted of [[communal]] houses for 10 to 15 families. Communities were united by common interest and language, and tended to form tribal groups by dialect. It is estimated that the Guaran<U+00ED> numbered some 400,000 people when they were first encountered by Europeans. At that time, they were sedentary and agricultural, subsisting largely on [[manioc]], maize, wild game, and [[honey]].

Equally little is known about early Guaran<U+00ED> society and beliefs. They practiced a form of [[animism|animistic]] [[pantheism]], much of which has survived in the form of [[folklore]] and numerous [[myths]]. According to the Jesuit missionary [[Martin Dobrizhoffer]], they practiced [[cannibalism]] at one point, perhaps as a [[funeral|funerary]] ritual, but later disposed of the dead in large jars placed inverted on the ground. [[Guaran<U+00ED> mythology]] is still widespread in rural Paraguay.

Much Guarani myth and legend was compiled by the [[Universidad Nacional de Misiones]] in northern [[Argentina]] and published as ''Myths and Legends: A journey around the Guarani lands, Anthology'' in 1870 (translated into [[English language]] in 1906). Guarani myth and legend can roughly be divided into the following broad categories:

* Cosmogonic and eschatological myths; the creation and destruction of all things as dictated by [[<U+00D1>amand<U+00FA>]] "the true father, the first one". After him comes a pantheon of gods, chief among them '''Ypor<U+00FA>''' who is more frequently known as [[Tup<U+00E3>]]. [[Yaci]] is another "good" deity who rules the night while [[A<U+00F1>a]] is a malign deity who dwells at the bottom of [[Iguazu River|Iguazu]].<ref>Salvo, Rosita Escalada & Zamboni, Olga; ''Myths and Legends: A journey around the Guarani lands. Anthology'' (translated by students from the Instituto Superior Lenguas Vivas, 1906), Editorial Universitaria, Universidad Nacional de Misiones, 1870, revised and corrected by Gloria Acosta, 2007. ISBN 978-987-9121-99-3 pp.9-29</ref>
* Animistic mythology, that is animals, plants and minerals being animated and capable of becoming [[anthropomorphic beings]] or in reverse the transmutated souls of people, either born or unborn, who have become animals, plants and minerals. The course of such [[anthropomorphism]] appears dictated by the pantheon of god like deities because of their virtues or vices. Such animistic legends include that of the [[Lobiz<U+00F3>n]], a [[werewolf]] type being, also the '''Mainimbi''' or [[hummingbird]] who transports good spirits that are resident in flowers back to Tup<U+00E1> "so he can cherish them". The '''Isond<U+00FA>''' or [[glow worms]] are the reincarnated spirits of certain people, as are the '''Panambi''' (the [[butterflies]]), '''Ca<U+00E1> Yar<U+00EE>i''' a woman who became the sacred [[herb]] [[Yerba]] and '''Irup<U+00E9>''', a woman who was turned into the [[giant lilly]] because she fell in love with the [[moon]].<ref name="Salvo, Rosita Escalada 1906 pp.29-63">Salvo, Rosita Escalada & Zamboni, Olga; ''Myths and Legends: A journey around the Guarani lands. Anthology'' (translated by students from the Instituto Superior Lenguas Vivas, 1906), Editorial Universitaria, Universidad Nacional de Misiones, 1870, revised and corrected by Gloria Acosta, 2007. ISBN 978-987-9121-99-3 pp.29-63</ref>
* [[Pombero]] who are [[goblin]] or [[elf]] like spirits who dwell in the forest and must be appeased. They have never been human. Principal among these is '''Yasi Yater<U+00E9>''' who has never been human and like all Pombero is from a different realm. His characteristics are vague and uncertain, and 'his' powers badly defined as is the place where 'he' resides. His characteristics are defined in one legend as a "handsome, thickly bearded, blond dwarf" who is naked and lives in tree trunks. Other versions say he loves [[honey]], his feet are backwards and he is an "ugly, lame, old man". Most legends agree that he snatches children and "licks them", wrapping them in climbing plants or drowning them in rivers. To appease him gifts, such as honey, are left in places in the forest associated with him. Another Pombero is '''Cuarah<U+00FA> Yara''' who whistles like birds and is their protector. He can be your friend but is known for abducting young boys who are alone and trying to catch birds. If necessary he can take the form of a person, a tree or a [[hyacinth (plant)|hyacinth]]. Finally, '''Curup<U+00ED>''' is a [[phallic]] mythological figure who will [[copulate]] with young women. He has scaly skin like a lizard, hypnotic eyes and an enormous [[penis]].<ref name="Salvo, Rosita Escalada 1906 pp.29-63"/>

The sacred [[Iguazu Falls|Iguazu]] waterfalls hold special significance for the Guarani and are the inspiration for numerous myths and legends. They reveal the sound of ancient battles at certain times, they are also the place where '''I-Yara''' - a malign Pomboro spirit - abducted '''Ang<U+00E1>''' - a fair maiden - and hid her. The [[swallows]] that inhabit the falls to this day vainly search for her.<ref>Salvo, Rosita Escalada & Zamboni, Olga; ''Myths and Legends: A journey around the Guarani lands.

===European contact===
In 1537, [[Gonzalo de Mendoza]] traversed through Paraguay to about the present Brazilian frontier. On his return, he made acquaintance with the Guaran<U+00ED> and founded the city of [[Asunci<U+00F3>n]], later the capital of Paraguay. The first governor of the Spanish territory of [[Guayr<U+00E1>]] initiated a policy of intermarriage between Europeans and the indigenous women, whose descendants characterize the Paraguayan nation today. He also initiated the [[enslavement]] of the natives.

The first two [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], Father Barcena and Father Angulo, came to what is now the State of [[Paran<U+00E1> (state)|Paran<U+00E1>]], Southern Brazil, in 1585, by land from the west. Others soon followed, and a Jesuit college was established at Asunci<U+00F3>n. In 1608, as a result of Jesuit protest against enslavement of the indigenous population, King [[Philip III of Spain]] gave authority to the Jesuits to convert and colonize the tribes of Guayr<U+00E1>. In the early period the name Paraguay was loosely used to designate all the basin of the river, including parts of what are now Uruguay, Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil.

Exploring expeditions were accompanied by [[Franciscan]] [[friar]]s. Early in the history of Asunci<U+00F3>n, Father [[Luis de Bola<U+00F1>os]] translated the [[catechism]] into the Guaran<U+00ED> language and preached to Guaran<U+00ED> people who resided in the area around the settlement. In 1588<U+2013>89 [[Francis Solanus|St. Francis Solanus]] crossed the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] wilderness from [[Peru]] and stopped at Asunci<U+00F3>n, but gave no attention to the Guaran<U+00ED>. His departure left the jesuits alone with their missionary work, and to defend the natives against slave dealers.<ref>"The larger portion of the population regarded it as a right, a privilege by virtue of conquest, that they should enslave the Indians" (Page, 470).</ref> The Jesuit [[provincial (religion)|provincial]] Torres arrived in 1607, and "immediately placed himself at the head of those who had opposed the cruelties at all times exercised over the natives".<ref>Page, 470</ref>

===Cultural preservation===

===Slavery===
[[Image:Indian Soldiers from the Coritiba Province Escorting Native Prisoners.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A Guaran<U+00ED> family captured by slave hunters. By [[Jean Baptiste Debret]]]]
The centre and depot of the slave trade was the town of [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]]. Originally a rendezvous place for [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], Dutch, and Spanish [[pirates]], it later became a refuge for criminals, who mixed with Native American and African women and actively participated in the capturing and selling of Guaran<U+00ED>s as slaves.

To oppose these armed and organized robbers, the tribes had only their bows and arrows, since the Spanish government prohibited the use of [[firearm]]s by all natives. Many Guaran<U+00ED>s were slain or enslaved by the slave-hunters active in Brazil during those years.

===Jesuit missions===
{{Main|Jesuit Reductions}}
With royal protection, the first Guayr<U+00E1> [[Mission (Christian)|mission]], Loreto, was established on the Paranapan<U+00E9> by Father Cataldino and Father Marcerata in 1610. As the mission provided the only real possible protection against enslavement, the Guaran<U+00ED> flocked there in such numbers that twelve more missions were created in rapid succession, containing in all 40,000 Guaranis. Stimulated by this success, Father Gonzalez and two companions journeyed to Uruguay and established two or three small missions in 1627. The local tribes killed the priests and the neophytes and burned the missions.

Slave raiders saw the Guaran<U+00ED> missions as "merely an opportunity of capturing more Indians than usual at a haul".<ref>Graham 57</ref> In 1629, an army of [[Paulistas]] surrounded the San Antonio mission, set fire to the church and other buildings, killed those who resisted or were too young or too old to travel, and carried the rest into slavery. [[S<U+00E3>o Miguel das Miss<U+00F5>es|San Miguel]] and Jesus Maria quickly met the same fate. Eventually, reinforcements gathered by Father Cataldino drove off the slavers. Within two years, all but two of the establishments were destroyed, and 60,000 Christian and converts were carried off for sale to [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The attacks usually took place on Sunday, when the whole mission population was gathered for [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. The priests were usually spared, but several were killed.

The guarani that survived were expected to denounce their spiritual beliefs under the authority of the Missionaries and Inquisition tribunals. These and all Native Americans suffered the fate of the largest Spiritual genocide in world history. The recorded letters from Columbus to Cortes detail the horrific massacres that men, woman and children suffered at the hands of the Spanish conquistadors and Catholic Priests.

Only a few thousand natives were left of nearly 100,000 just before the Paulista invasion. Father [[Antonio Ruiz de Montoya]] purchased 10,000 cattle, and was able to convert the natives from farmers to stock raisers. Soon under Fathers Ran<U+00E7>oncier and Romero the Uruguay missions were re-established. In 1632 the [[Mameluco]]s discovered a new line of attack from the south. In 1638, despite some successful resistance, all twelve of the missions beyond the Uruguay were abandoned and their people consolidated with the community of the Missions Territory. In the last raid Father Afaro was killed.

In the same year Father Montoya, after having successfully opposed the governor's and the bishop of Asunci<U+00F3>n's attempts to reduce the native's liberties and the mission administration, sailed for Europe. On this trip he was successful in obtaining letters from [[Pope Urban VIII]] forbidding the enslavement of the missionaries under the severest church penalties, and from King [[Philip IV of Spain]], permitting guaran<U+00ED>es to carry firearms for defense and to be trained in their use by veteran soldiers who had become Jesuits.

When the next Paulista army, 800 strong, attacked the missions in 1641 they were met by a body of Christian Guaran<U+00ED> armed with guns on the [[Acaray River]]. In two battles, the Paulista army suffered a defeat that warded off invasions for ten years. In 1651, the war between Spain and Portugal encouraged another Paulista attack to gain territory for Portugal. Before Spanish troops could arrive to help defend the missions, the fathers themselves led a Guaran<U+00ED> army against the enemy. In 1732, at the time of their greatest prosperity, the Guaran<U+00ED> missions were guarded by a well-drilled and well-equipped army of 7,000 guaran<U+00ED>es. On more than one occasion this mission army, accompanied by their priests, defended the Spanish colony.

In 1732, there were 30 Guaran<U+00ED> missions with 141,252 converted guaran<U+00ED>es.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Two years later a [[smallpox]] epidemic killed approximately 30,000 of them. In 1765, a second outbreak killed approximately 12,000 more, and then spread westward through the tribes of the [[Chaco (tribe)|Chaco]].

====Uruguay missions saved====
In 1750, a treaty between Spain and Portugal (the [[Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750)|Treaty of Madrid]]) transferred to Portugal the territory of the seven missions on the Uruguay, and the guaran<U+00ED>es were ordered to be removed. They refused to leave, being familiar with the Portuguese as slave-hunters. Seven years of [[guerrilla warfare]] killed thousands of them (see [[Guarani War]]). The Jesuits secured a royal decree restoring the disputed mission territory to Spanish jurisdiction. Two missions in 1747 and a third in 1760 were established in the sub-tribe of the Itatines, or Tobatines, in Central Paraguay, far north of the older mission group. In one of these, [[San Joaquin]]{{disambiguation needed|date=December 2012}} (1747), [[Martin Dobrizhoffer]] ministered for eight years.

====Jesuits expelled====
{{further2|[[Suppression of the Society of Jesus]]}}
In 1767, the Jesuits were expelled from Spanish dominions by royal edict. Fearing the outcome of this decision, [[viceroy]] [[Antonio Mar<U+00ED>a Bucareli y Urs<U+00FA>a]] entrusted the execution of the mandate in 1768 to two officers with a force of 500 troops. Despite their mission army of 14,000, the Jesuits submitted without resistance.

====Decline of the missions====
[[Image:Casa de los Padres-San Ignacio Min<U+00ED>.jpeg|thumb|250px|right|Ruins of the church at [[S<U+00E3>o Miguel das Miss<U+00F5>es]], Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.]]
The missions were turned over to priests of other orders, chiefly [[Franciscans]], but under a code of regulations drawn up by the viceroy and modeled largely on the Jesuit system. Under a chaotic political regulation, the missions rapidly declined. Most guaran<U+00ED>es returned to the countryside. According to the official census of 1801, fewer than 45,000 guaran<U+00ED>es remained; cattle, sheep, and horses had disappeared; the fields and [[orchard]]s were overgrown or cut down and the churches were in ruins. The long period of revolutionary struggle that followed completed the destruction. In 1814, the mission Indians numbered 8,000, and in 1848 the few who remained were declared citizens.

==Guaran<U+00ED> people today==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
[[File:Pai Tavytera Indians.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Pai Tavytera people]] in [[Amambay Department]], Paraguay, 2012]]
The Guaran<U+00ED> people and culture persist. Nearly all the forest tribes on the borders of Paraguay are Guaran<U+00ED>. Many are descendants of mission exiles. In Paraguay, Guaran<U+00ED> lineage predominates in the population and the Guaran<U+00ED> language is spoken in most provinces to this day.

===Bolivia===
The Guaran<U+00ED> ethnic group in Bolivia lives in a region of the country near the Paraguayan and Argentine borders, including portions of [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]], [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]], [[Tarija Department]]s. This region reaches nearly as far north as [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]] and includes portions of the [[Guapay River|Guapay]], [[Parapet<U+00ED> River|Parapet<U+00ED>]], and [[Pilcomayo River|<U+0197>t<U+0268>ka Guasu (or Pilcomayo) River]] valleys.<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Duke University Press | isbn = 978-0-8223-4529-9 | last = Gustafson | first = Bret Darin | title = New languages of the state : indigenous resurgence and the politics of knowledge in Bolivia | location = Durham | year = 2009 | page = 2 }}</ref> Bolivian Guaran<U+00ED> are represented by the [[Assembly of the Guaran<U+00ED> People]].

==Language==
{{Main|Guaran<U+00ED> language}}
The [[Guaran<U+00ED> language]] has been much cultivated, its literature covering a wide range of subjects. Many works were written by  priests, either wholly or partly in the native language, and were published by the mission press in Loreto. Among the most important treatises on the language are the "Tesoro de la Lengua Guaran<U+00ED>" (Madrid, 1639) by Father Montoya, published in Paris and [[Leipzig]] in 1876; and the "Catecismo de la Lengua Guaran<U+00ED>" of Father Diego D<U+00ED>az de la Guerra (Madrid, 1630).

The language was also used in other tribes such as the Chaco in Paraguay.

The Guaran<U+00ED> were later described, amongst many other historical documents in existence today, in 1903 by [[Croatia]]n explorers [[Mirko and Stjepan Seljan]]. Several English words can be traced to Guaran<U+00ED> roots, such as "tapioca", "toucan" and "jaguar."

Presently, the language is still the main binding characteristic of the Guaran<U+00ED> people. The Argentinian communities speak mainly Mbya-Guaran<U+00ED>, as opposed to the Tupi-Guaran<U+00ED> and Guaran<U+00ED>-Jopara spoken in Paraguay and Brazil. These varieties are mutually intelligible. The Guarani villages located in the south of Brazil and in the north of Argentina are more marginalized due to European immigration following the First and Second World Wars. Many Guaran<U+00ED> do not speak Spanish and the European immigrant population does not speak Guaran<U+00ED>. The Mbya-Guaran<U+00ED> still live in secluded villages and only the "[[cacique]]" and some other officials in their community learn Spanish. Recently the government of Argentina has partly financed bilingual schools in the northern province of [[Misiones Province|Misiones]].

Paraguay is a bilingual country and most of its Spanish-speaking population also speaks a form of Guaran<U+00ED>. The Paraguayan population learns Guaran<U+00ED> both informally from social interaction and formally in public schools. Guaran<U+00ED> became part of the required curriculum in public schools during the ten years since the fall of ex-President [[Alfredo Stroessner]] in 1989. The native populations in Paraguay speak the traditional Tupi-Guaran<U+00ED> while the majority of bilingual Paraguayans speak Guaran<U+00ED>-Jopara ("Jopara" meaning mixed). Many words have been borrowed from Spanish but include traditional Tupi-Guaran<U+00ED> prefixes and suffixes. For example "Nde rentede pa?" meaning "Do you understand?" The "entende" root is borrowed from the Spanish verb "entender" meaning "to understand." The evolution of Guaran<U+00ED>-Jopara is very similar to "Border Spanish" or "Spanglish" where the mixture of the two languages begins to develop its own rules and uses. An understanding of both Guaran<U+00ED> and Spanish is required for full fluency.

In August 2009 Bolivia launched a Guaran<U+00ED>-language university at Kuruyuki in the southeastern province of Chuquisaca which will bear the name of the indigenous hero [[Apiaguaiki Tumpa]]. The education minister of Bolivia said that indigenous universities <U+201C>will open up not only the Western and universal world of knowledge, but the knowledge of our own identity<U+201D>.<ref>[http://www.boliviaun.org/cms/?p=1158 www.boliviaun.org]</ref>
