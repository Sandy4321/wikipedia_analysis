'''''Darkman''''' is a 1990 American [[Superhero film|superhero]] [[action film]] directed and co-written by [[Sam Raimi]]. It is based on a [[short story]] Raimi wrote that paid homage to [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s [[horror film]]s of the 1930s. The film stars [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Darkman (character)|Peyton Westlake]], a scientist who is attacked and left for dead by a ruthless mobster, Robert Durant (played by [[Larry Drake]]) after his girlfriend, an attorney ([[Frances McDormand]]) runs afoul of a corrupt developer ([[Colin Friels]]).

Unable to secure the rights to either ''[[The Shadow (1994 film)|The Shadow]]'' or ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', Raimi decided to create his own [[superhero]] and struck a deal with [[Universal Studios]] to make his first [[Hollywood]] studio film. He was subjected to a grueling screenwriting process and equally difficult [[post-production]] battle with the studio.

''Darkman'' was generally well received by critics and performed well at the box office, grossing almost $49 million worldwide, well above its $16 million budget. This financial success spawned two direct-to-video [[sequel]]s, ''[[Darkman II: The Return of Durant|The Return of Durant]]'' (1994) and ''[[Darkman III: Die Darkman Die|Die Darkman Die]]'' (1996), as well as comic books, video games, and action figures. Over the years, ''Darkman'' has become regarded as a [[cult film]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Plot==
Scientist Dr. [[Darkman (character)|Peyton Westlake]] is developing a new type of synthetic skin to help acid burned victims. He is frustrated with a flaw that causes the skin to rapidly disintegrate after being exposed to light for 99 minutes. His girlfriend, attorney Julie Hastings, discovers the Bellasarious Memorandum, an incriminating document proving that corrupt developer Louis Strack has been bribing members of the zoning commission. Before she leaves, Westlake asks her to marry him, but she hesitates. When she confronts Strack, he confesses, but shows Julie what he's been planning: To design a brand new city which would create a substantial number of new jobs. He also warns Julie to keep her guard up as mobster Robert Durant would do anything to get his hands on the document.

Back at Westlake's lab, the power and lights die out. When Westlake asks his assistant Yakatito how long the skin's been holding, they are both astounded as they find that the skin is stable after 100 minutes. Westlake deduces that the synthetic skin is photosensitive. Their joy is short lived as Durant and his henchmen show up and demand the Bellasarious Memorandum.  While searching for the document, Durant and his gang attack Westlake, burning his hands and disfiguring him in the process, and kill Yakatito. After they find the document, they rig the lab to explode, with Julie watching the explosion just before pondering whether or not to marry Westlake. The blast throws Westlake through the roof and into the river. Thought to be dead by Julie, who attends his funeral, he survives but is hideously burned. He is brought to a hospital and subjected to a radical treatment which cuts the nerves of the [[spinothalamic tract]] so pain is no longer felt. However, he also loses his tactile sensation. Removing this sensory input gives him [[enhanced strength]] due to [[Adrenaline|adrenal]] overload and keeps his injuries from incapacitating him, but it also mentally destabilizes him.

After mourning the loss of his lab and realizing how badly burnt he has become, Westlake re-establishes the lab in a condemned building, using digitization to create a mask of his original face. The process is long, and in the meantime, Westlake murders the henchman Rick in cold blood and studies his enemies in order to subdue and impersonate another henchman Pauly, subsequently causing his death afterward by Durant. When his face mask is complete, Westlake manages to convince Julie that he is indeed alive, and that he was in a coma rather than being dead. He is aware of Julie seeing Strack after his supposed death and eventually confronts her, to which she responds that Strack only comforted her. Westlake does not tell Julie about his condition, but asks her various questions on whether she would accept him regardless or not. Westlake now has a full clock schedule: Making the skin last longer than 99 minutes, visiting Julie, studying his enemies and even mimicking their voice patterns. His next excursion has him impersonating Durant himself, causing confusion among him and his henchmen.

The next time Westlake and Julie have a date at the carnival, an altercation causes Westlake to lose his temper and inadvertently reveals to Julie that there is indeed something wrong with him. She follows him as he flees (his 99 minutes were up,) and when she discovers that he was using masks to hide his true face, she calls out to Peyton that she still loves him regardless. Julie later tells Strack that she can no longer see him, and after discovering the Bellasarious Memorandum on his desk while he was on the phone, she confirms that Strack was collaborating with Durant the entire time. She tells him that Westlake is still alive, but Strack tells her that as long as he has the memorandum, no charges can be filed. When Julie leaves, Durant enters and is told by Strack to capture Julie and kill Westlake.

Westlake eventually succeeds in killing Durant and all of his henchmen (except for the one with the wooden gun leg whose fate is unknown). Westlake impersonates Durant one final time when he meets up with Strack and a captive Julie as Strack plans to make the city "one less attorney." Westlake's ruse is broken by Strack who fights him on an unfinished building floor 650 feet from the ground upon Strack unmasking him. When Westlake gets the upper hand, Strack calls his bluff by saying that killing him would not be something he could live with. Westlake then drops Strack to his death saying to himself: "I'm learning to live with a lot of things." Unfortunately, when Julie tries to convince Westlake that he can still return to his old life, Westlake declines saying that he has now become a monster and that the Peyton she knew was gone. In the final scene, he runs away from Julie as they exit an elevator and is seen from behind pulling on a mask which, when he turns around, reveals the face of [[Bruce Campbell]].  During this scene, Westlake can be heard off-screen: "I am everyone and no one. Everywhere. Nowhere. Call me... Darkman."

==Cast and characters==
[[Image:Darkman12.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Liam Neeson]] as Darkman]]
* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Darkman (character)|Peyton Westlake / Darkman]], a brilliant scientist who was left for dead and burned alive as he returns to seek revenge on those who made him what he is. Originally, Raimi's longtime friend and collaborator [[Bruce Campbell]] was set to play Darkman, but the studio balked at the idea because they did not think Campbell could carry the role.<ref name= "Muir, John">{{cite news| last = Muir| first = John Kenneth| coauthors =| title = The Unseen Force: The Films of Sam Raimi| work =| pages =| language =| publisher = Applause Books| date = May 2004| url =| accessdate = }}</ref> [[Gary Oldman]] and [[Bill Paxton]] were also considered before Liam Neeson was cast.<ref name= "Muir, John"/> For the role, Raimi was looking for someone who could suggest "a monster with the soul of a man, and I needed an actor who could do that beneath a lot of makeup" and liked Neeson's "old [[Gary Cooper]] charisma."<ref name= "Counts2">{{cite news| last = Counts| first = Kyle| coauthors =| title = Heart of Darkness| work = [[Starlog]]| pages = | language = | publisher = | date = December 1990| url = | accessdate = }}</ref> The actor was drawn to the operatic nature of the story and the inner turmoil of his character.<ref name= "Counts2"/> To research for the role, Neeson contacted the Phoenix Society, an organization that helps accident victims with severe disfigurements adjust to re-entering society.<ref name= "Counts2"/>
* [[Frances McDormand]] as Julie Hastings, a district attorney and Peyton's love interest. Raimi had wanted to work with Frances McDormand but the studio resisted this notion and almost cast [[Julia Roberts]] before ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' made her a star.<ref name= "Muir, John"/> At one point, they wanted [[Demi Moore]] for the role.<ref name= "Muir, John"/> The director even tested [[Bridget Fonda]] but felt that she was too young for Neeson.<ref name= "Muir, John"/>
[[Image:Darkman01.jpg|right|thumb|260px|[[Larry Drake]] as Robert G. Durant and [[Ted Raimi]] as Rick]]
* [[Colin Friels]] as Louis Strack Jr., the corrupt and ruthless billionaire developer who runs Strack Industries. He bribes members of the city zoning commission to further his ambitious construction project (which he dubs the "City of the Future"), and employs Durant and his gang to eliminate anyone who gets in his way, even his own wife. He and Darkman have their final battle atop one of Strack's half-finished skyscrapers at the film's climax.
* [[Larry Drake]] as Robert G. Durant, a ruthless but sadistic mob boss and the head of his own criminal organization. He auditioned for the film and Raimi liked the way he underplayed the character, "quiet and careful, yet intense," the actor remembers.<ref name= "Counts, Kyle">{{cite news| last = Counts| first = Kyle| coauthors =| title = Black Heart| work = [[Starlog]]| pages = | language = | publisher = | date = January 1991| url = | accessdate = }}</ref> The director had never seen ''[[L.A. Law]]'' but found that Drake's face reminded him of "a modern day [[Edward G. Robinson]]. He looked so mean, so domineering, yet he had this urban wit about him. I thought, 'My God, this guy is not only threatening-looking, he has a good physical presence <U+2013> what a perfect adversary for the Darkman!'"<ref name= "Counts, Kyle"/>
* Nelson Mashita as Yakatito
* [[Jessie Lawrence Ferguson]] as Eddie Black
* Rafael H. Robledo as Rudy Guzman
* [[Ted Raimi]] as Ricky, Robert G. Durant's henchman
* [[Nicholas Worth]] as Pauly, Robert G. Durant's henchman
* Dan Bell as Smiley
* [[Dan Hicks (actor)|Dan Hicks]] as Skip
* [[Bridget Hoffman]] as Computer Voice

In addition, [[Bruce Campbell]] has a cameo in the film as Peyton's last seen disguise (credited as "[[Fake Shemp|Final Shemp]]"). [[Sam Raimi]] himself cameos as a hospital intern.

==Development==
===Origins===
For a long time, [[Sam Raimi]] had been interested in [[Film adaptation|adapting a comic book into a film]]. He had pursued and failed to secure the rights to both ''[[The Shadow]]'' and ''[[Batman]]'' and decided to create his own. The initial idea Raimi had for ''Darkman'' was of a man who could change his face.<ref name= "Warren, Bill">{{cite news | last = Warren | first = Bill | coauthors = | title = ''The Evil Dead'' Companion | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | date = January 15, 2001 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> He has said that he drew inspiration from those films as well as ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]''.<ref name= "Warren, Bill"/> Raimi was also inspired by the Universal horror films of the 1930s and 1940s because "they made me fear the hideous nature of the hero and at the same time drew me to him. I went back to that idea of the man who is noble and turns into a monster".<ref name= "Johnston, Sheila">{{cite news | last = Johnston | first = Sheila | coauthors = | title = Beauty Within the Beast | work = [[The Independent]] | pages = | language = | publisher =  | date = November 9, 1990 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> He originally wrote a 30-page short story, titled "The Darkman", and then developed into a 40-page treatment. At this point, according to Raimi, "it became the story of a man who had lost his face and had to take on other faces, a man who battled criminals using this power".<ref name= "Warren, Bill"/> It also became more of a tragic love story in the tradition of ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''. In 1987, Raimi submitted the treatment to [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] which they liked, green-lighted a budget in the range of $8<U+2013>12 million, and suggested that he get a screenwriter to flesh out the story.<ref name= "Warren2"/>

===Screenplay===
[[File:Joshua Goldin Shankbone 2009 Tribeca.jpg|thumb|175px|Screenwriter Joshua Goldin.]]
The more Raimi worked, the more Darkman became a crime-fighting figure, "a non-superpowered man who, here, is a hideous thing who fights crime. As he became that hideous thing, it became more like ''The Phantom of the Opera'', the creature who wants the girl but who was too much of a beast to have her," Raimi said.<ref name= "Warren, Bill"/> The process of developing his treatment into a screenplay was difficult with Raimi hiring ex-[[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] [[Chuck Pfarrer]] based on his work on ''[[Navy SEALs (film)|Navy SEALs]]''.<ref name= "Italie, Hillel">{{cite news | last = Italie | first = Hillel | coauthors = | title = Beauties, Beasts and 'Biff!' 'Bam!' 'Pow!' | work = [[Associated Press]] | pages = | language = | publisher =  | date = September 12, 1990 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> He wrote the first draft and then Raimi's brother, Ivan (a doctor), wrote drafts two through four with Sam. Ivan made sure that the medical aspects and scientific elements were authentic as possible given the nature of the story.<ref name= "Stanley, John">{{cite news | last = Stanley | first = John | coauthors = | title = ''Darkman'' Brings Director's Talent to Light | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = August 26, 1990 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>

As Raimi and his producing partner [[Robert Tapert]] progressed through various drafts, they realized that there was a potential franchise on their hands. Universal brought in screenwriting brothers Daniel and Joshua Goldin to work on the script. According to Daniel, they were presented with various drafts and "lots of little story documents. There was just material everywhere; drafts seemed to go in many directions."<ref name= "Warren, Bill"/> Goldin said that they "spent a lot of time talking and pulling together a way of making the story work. I think that mostly we talked in terms of the nuts and bolts of the story."<ref name= "Muir, John"/> The Goldins added new lines of dialogue, new characters and bits of action. The studio still wasn't satisfied so the Raimi brothers wrote drafts six through twelve before they had a shooting script.<ref name= "Stanley, John"/> For Raimi, he wanted to emphasize Peyton/Darkman's arc over the course of the film. He said, "I decided to explore a man's soul. In the beginning, a sympathetic, sincere man. In the middle, a vengeful man committing heinous acts against his enemies. And in the end, a man full of self-hatred for what he's become, who must drift off into the night, into a world apart from everyone he knows and all the things he loves."<ref name= "Stanley, John"/>

===Pre-production===
Working with Universal meant a significant increase in budget for Raimi. This allowed him to design and build a laboratory set for Darkman and afford helicopters and professional stuntmen to film the climactic helicopter chase through the city.<ref name= "Portman, Jamie">{{cite news | last = Portman | first = Jamie | coauthors = | title = Horror can be a labor of love | work = [[Toronto Star]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = August 16, 1990 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> He was eventually given $16 million to work with, including a longer schedule and much more effects work.

Look-wise, the filmmaker was interested in paying homage to Universal horror films of the 1930s. Production designer Randy Ser remarked, "if you look at Darkman's lab that he moves into, which is an old warehouse, what was on my mind was Dr. Frankenstein. There were a number of references visually to what we were thinking about in regards to those films."<ref name= "Muir, John"/> Raimi consciously wanted to tone down his style because of a desire to "get into the characters' heads and follow them as real human beings in extraordinary circumstances".<ref name= "Warren2"/>

McDormand and Neeson worked closely in rehearsals, rewriting the three love scenes they had together after he becomes Darkman. They got through these scenes, according to the actress, by depending on "each other's knowledge, of theater and each other."<ref name= "Counts2"/>

===Principal photography===
Reportedly, McDormand and Raimi were not always on the same page while making the film. The filmmaker said that directing her was "very difficult".<ref name= "Warren2">{{cite news | last = Warren | first = Bill | coauthors = | title = The Man Behind ''Darkman'' | work = [[Fangoria]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 1990 | url =  | accessdate = }}</ref> Raimi said, "apparently I didn't know Fran as well as I thought I did ... The reason it was difficult was that our conception of the best movie to make differed, arguing in trying to make the best picture possible. We did come across disagreements, but they were very healthy."<ref name= "Warren2"/>

Durant's finger collection developed over the Pfarrer and Raimi brothers drafts. The director wanted a specific trademark for the character <U+2013> one that hinted at a military background.<ref name= "Counts, Kyle"/>

Neeson worked in ten-piece makeup, sometimes for 18 hours.<ref name= "Johnston, Sheila"/> He saw the lengthy time spent in extensive makeup as a challenge and liked "the idea of working behind a mask on camera, and just exploring the possibilities of what that entailed."<ref name= "Counts2"/> He and the makeup artists did tests using certain glues and resins. They also timed how fast they could put the makeup and costume on. Neeson worked with the costume designer on his outfit, including aspects like the cloak.<ref name= "Counts2"/> The hardest part for the actor was speaking with false teeth and he ended up doing "a lot of work on my voice <U+2013> I didn't want the [false teeth] to move at all."<ref name= "Counts2"/>

===Editing===
Raimi and Tapert ran into conflicts with the studio during [[post-production]]. The director had a problem with the editor that the studio assigned him and eight weeks into assembling the rough cut, he was not following Raimi's storyboards. The editor had a nervous breakdown and left.<ref name= "McDonagh, Maitland">{{cite news | last = McDonagh | first = Maitland | coauthors = | title = Filmmaking on the Fringe | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = | year = 1995 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> Early preview screenings did not go well as people laughed in the wrong places and complained about a lack of a happy ending.<ref name= "Arnold, Gary">{{cite news | last = Arnold | first = Gary | coauthors = | title = Sam Raimi's Flair Makes ''Darkman'' A Reel Delight | work = [[Washington Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = August 23, 1990 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> Universal told Raimi that some people rated ''Darkman'' the worst film they had ever seen. According to executives, the film was one of the worst-scoring pictures in Universal's history.<ref name= "McDonagh, Maitland"/> Then, two preview screenings, one with Danny Elfman's score, went well. Tapert remembers, "the experience on ''Darkman'' was very difficult for Sam and me; it isn't the picture we thought it should be, based on the footage we shot and all that. The studio got nervous about some kind of wild things in it, and made us take them out, which was unfortunate."<ref name= "Muir, John"/> However, Raimi did like the "brilliant" marketing campaign that the studio came up with, releasing posters in advance with a silhouette of the main character and the question, "Who is Darkman?" According to the director, "the marketing made the film a money-maker".<ref name= "McDonagh, Maitland"/>

Released on August 17, 1990, the soundtrack to ''Darkman'' was composed by [[Danny Elfman]], who previously scored the music to [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' in 1989.

Elfman said of his score, "Again old-fashioned and melodramatic, but in a way that I'm crazy about. Sam Raimi has a wonderful visual style that lends itself easily to music. It was an enormous relief writing long, extended musical sequences, something which is very rare in modern films. No reason to hold back on this one."<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = ''Darkman'' | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = Danny Elfman's Music for A Darkened People | date = | url = http://elfman.filmmusic.com/filmography/darkman.html | accessdate = 2007-08-07 }}</ref>

==Reaction==
Ads asking "Who is Darkman?" began appearing on bus benches, public transit, and television as early as June 1990.

The film enjoyed generally favorable reviews and holds an aggregate of 79% on Rotten Tomatoes, out of the 47 reviews 37 were positive.

==Sequels==
===''Darkman II: The Return of Durant''===
{{main|Darkman II: The Return of Durant}}
In this 1995 [[direct-to-video]] sequel, scientist Peyton Westlake (now played by [[Arnold Vosloo]]) continues to work on his synthetic skin, funding himself by stealing from gangsters.

===''Darkman III: Die, Darkman, Die''===
{{main|Darkman III: Die Darkman Die}}
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}} 
In the second direct-to-video ''Darkman'' sequel, released in 1996, Peyton Westlake (Vosloo) steals a bag of money from [[drug lord]] Peter Rooker ([[Jeff Fahey]]) to continue his research.

Rooker is determined to find out how Darkman has his superior strength, and enlists the aid of Dr. Bridget Thorne ([[Darlanne Fluegel]]), a new character [[Retroactive continuity|retroactively]] put into Darkman's origin as one of the doctors who first treated Westlake's body after he was burnt in the first movie. Obtaining a sample of Westlake's adrenaline, Dr. Thorne develops a designer steroid that enhances a person's strength at the cost of his or her mental agility. It is also revealed that Rooker funded Dr. Thorne's research that allowed her to develop the treatment used on Darkman in the first movie, and that she was Rooker's [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]].

Learning of what has happened, Darkman plans his revenge against Rooker by impersonating him while in the company of his family and colleagues to bring him down. Darkman sets out to destroy the formula to the steroid and seek vengeance against Rooker, but not at the cost of Rooker's wife and child. Darkman does create a stable synthetic skin but uses the only sample to fix the damage done to Rooker's daughter.

This film shifts some of the focus from action to drama, during Peyton's scenes with Rooker's wife ([[Roxann Dawson|Roxann Biggs-Dawson]]) and his child, reminding him of how life could have been for him.

''Die, Darkman, Die'' was originally intended to be the first sequel to the original ''Darkman'', but when Larry Drake became available to reprise his role of Durant, this entry was moved back until ''The Return of Durant'' had been finished and released.

[[Universal Studios|Universal Television]] financed a 30-minute television pilot based on ''Darkman'', which was made in 1992 and was to be shown on Fox.<ref>{{cite news | last = Donlon | first = Brian | coauthors = | title = Networks brim with series possibilities | work = [[USA Today]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = March 26, 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> The pilot retold the origin of the character (with some alterations) and introduced several new characters. [[Christopher Bowen]] starred in the role of Peyton Westlake/Darkman, [[Larry Drake]] reprised his role of Robert G. Durant, and [[Kathleen York]] played the cop, Jenny.

The origin is similar to the one in the original film as Peyton discovers his synthetic skin, is attacked and left for dead by Durant and his gang. In this version, however, Peyton is already married to Julie, and she is killed in the explosion. As in the films, Westlake becomes the Darkman, and seeks vengeance on Durant and his gang. Darkman's headquarters are based in an abandoned observatory overlooking the city, and he is wanted by the police for his actions against Durant's gang. The pilot ends with some scenes from the first movie (particularly of Darkman and Durant fighting) and Darkman stating that Justice will answer with a brand new face.

Merchandising for the character all but disappeared for close to a decade until [[SOTA Toys]] obtained the rights to make a Darkman [[action figure]]. SOTA president [[Jerry Macaluso]] was interviewed by [[Dread Central]]:

{{quote|This leads to an interesting story on ''Darkman''. Universal didn't know they owned the merchandise rights. It didn't show up on any of their merchandise sheets. I had to convince them to spend a little time and have their lawyers look into it. I knew at the time that film was made Sam (Raimi) didn't have the power to retain those rights so it HAD to be Universal even though they said they didn't have them. Turns out I was right and afterwards Darkman started to show up in all their catalogs of films available to license...|<ref>{{cite news | last = Butane | first = Johnny | coauthors = | title = Macaluso, Jerry (SOTA Toys) | work = Dread Central.com | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = January 22, 2005 | url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/index.php?name=Interviews&req=showcontent&id=63 | accessdate = 2007-12-11 }}</ref>}}
