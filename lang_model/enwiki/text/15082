'''Tyson Gay''' (born August 9, 1982) is an [[United States|American]] [[track and field athletics|track and field]] [[Sprint (race)|sprinter]]. His primary events are the [[100 metres|100&nbsp;meters]] and [[200 metres|200&nbsp;meters]]. His personal bests establish him as third fastest athlete in the history of the 100 and 200&nbsp;meter races, with times of 9.77 (the American record) and 19.62&nbsp;seconds respectively. He also ran the fastest time ever recorded in the 100&nbsp;m dash&mdash;9.68&nbsp;s&mdash;which was aided by a [[wind assistance|non-legal wind]] of 4.1&nbsp;[[meters per second]] (the allowable for official [[IAAF]] record purposes being 2.0&nbsp;m/s).

Gay has won numerous medals in major international competitions, highlighted by his gold medal sweep of the 100&nbsp;m, 200&nbsp;m and [[4 x 100 meters relay]] at the [[2007 World Championships in Athletics|2007 Osaka World Championships]]. This made Gay the second sprinter to win all three events at the same World Championships, after [[Maurice Greene (athlete)|Maurice Greene]]. At the 2008 Olympic Trials Gay established the American record in the 100 m with a time of 9.77 s, but later in that meet suffered a severe [[hamstring]] injury which contributed to his failure to win a single medal at the [[Beijing Olympics]].
