'''Roanoke Rapids''' is a city in [[Halifax County]], [[North Carolina]], [[United States]]. The population was 16,957 at the 2000 census. It is the principal city of the Roanoke Rapids [[Roanoke Rapids micropolitan area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]].

==Geography==
Roanoke Rapids is located at {{coord|36|27|16|N|77|39|17|W|city}} (36.454528, -77.654822){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|7.8|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.04|sqmi|km2}} of it (0.51%) is water.

The town is located at the beginning of the North Carolina Piedmont, on the [[Roanoke River]] at the [[fall line]], which marks the area where an upland region (continental [[bedrock]]) and a [[coastal plain]] (coastal [[alluvium|alluvia]]) meet. The fall line is typically prominent where a river crosses it, for there will usually be rapids or waterfalls. Because of these features, river boats typically could not travel any further inland. Because settlements needed a port and a ready supply of water power, they often developed where the river crosses the fall line.  The Roanoke River and its falls inspired the development of Roanoke Rapids; businessmen such as Sam Patterson and other textile manufacturers used the river to power their mills.  

The most prominent example of fall line settlement was the establishment of the cities along the eastern coast of the [[United States]] where the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian Rise]] and the coastal plains meet.

The seven-mile-long Roanoke Rapids Canal trail starts at the Roanoke dam and ends roughly a mile after passing the historic aqueduct.  The trail is fairly narrow, which limits access to walkers, runners, and bikers.

==Industry==
The city was first settled as a [[mill town]], being home to multiple [[textile mills]]. [[Crystal Lee Sutton]] (Jenkins), was a worker and union organizer for the [[J.P. Stevens]] & Co. mill in Roanoke Rapids, upon whose union activities the movie [[Norma Rae]] was based. Roanoke Rapids is now home to a [[Kapstone|KapStone Paper and Packaging]] paper manufacturing facility.

==Attractions==
Roanoke Rapids is known for a number of historical sites.  The original [[Roanoke Rapids High School]] building or Senior building as it is sometimes referred, opened in 1921 and is still in use. The building embodies many elements of Elizabethan Gothic and [[Tudor Revival]] architecture in its castle-like facade. It was built by industrialist Samuel Paterson and designed by renowned architect [[Hobart Upjohn]] in a modified H-design. Hobart Upjohn was the grandson of Richard Upjohn, architect of [[Christ Episcopal Church (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Christ Episcopal Church]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]].  The high school is the dominant building in the city's central core and is flanked by another castle-like structure which formerly housed a [[National Guard Armory]]. 
 
The Roanoke Canal Museum and Trail is one of the city's oldest historical sites. The 1823 canal lock building has been adapted as a museum to show the significance of the canal system to American westward expansion.  It offers an in-depth look at the influential people who pushed for the [[Roanoke River]] to become a source of trade and navigation, as well as the commodities that were shipped and traded on the Roanoke River. The trail, over seven miles long, is adjacent to the museum and largely parallel to the Roanoke River. It is commonly used by runners, bikers, photographers, and wildlife admirers.  It is used as the course for the annual Roanoke Canal Half Marathon, and the Roanoke Canal Mountain Biking Club is located nearby.

Roanoke Rapids had planned [[Carolina Crossroads]], an entertainment district founded by a group of local business developers.  Attractions were to include the [[Randy Parton]] Theater as an anchor for the development, an outdoor amphitheater, a campground, an aquarium, hotels, restaurants, outlet shopping, travel center, several other dinner theaters, and water park.  The association between the city and [[Randy Parton]], brother of [[Dolly Parton]], ended in December 2006.  The city renamed the theater as the Roanoke Rapids Theater. A [[Black Widow Billiards Center]] was also announced by the pool player, [[Jeanette Lee (pool player)|Jeanette Lee]].<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Jeanette Lee Opens Black Widow Billiards Centers | date= | publisher= | url =http://triangle.dbusinessnews.com/shownews.php?type_news=latest&newsid=111899 | work =Triangle Business Journal | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-20 | language = }}</ref> In October 2008, the city agreed to a lease/sale ofl the Roanoke Rapids Theater to Lafayette Gatling for $12.5 million. Gatling, a Chicago developer, said he would continue to develop the theater and work with the developers of the [[Carolina Crossroads]] entertainment district.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.wral.com/news/state/story/3842667/ | title=Roanoke Rapids to sell theater to Chicago man | date=October 29, 2008 | accessdate=2008-11-10 | work=WRAL.com}}</ref> In November 2011, the city agreed to sell the theater outright to Gatling in an effort to reduce the city's debt from the project.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gatling to Purchase The Roanoke Rapids Theatre|url=http://www.rrdailyherald.com/news/gatling-to-purchase-the-roanoke-rapids-theatre/article_529ae428-0fdc-11e1-90aa-001cc4c002e0.html | date=November 15, 2011 | accessdate=2011-11-15 | work=RRDailyHerald.com}}</ref>
