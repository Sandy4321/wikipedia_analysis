The '''pallid sturgeon''' (''Scaphirhynchus albus'') is an [[endangered species]] of [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]], [[Endemism|endemic]] to the waters of the [[Missouri River|Missouri]] and lower [[Mississippi River]] basins of the United States.  Named for its pale coloration, the pallid sturgeon is closely related to the relatively common [[shovelnose sturgeon]] (''Scaphirhyncus platorhynchus''), but is much larger, averaging between {{convert|30|and|60|in|cm}} in length and {{convert|85|lb|kg}} in weight at maturity.<ref name="montana">{{cite web| title = Pallid Sturgeon - Scaphirhynchus albus| publisher = Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks| url = http://fwp.mt.gov/wildthings/tande/pallid.html| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}</ref><ref name="Platte">{{cite web| title = The Pallid Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus)| publisher = Platte River Endangered Species Partnership| url = http://www.platteriver.org/backgr/sturg.htm| accessdate =2008-11-19}}</ref>  The pallid sturgeon takes 15&nbsp;years to mature and  spawns infrequently, but can live for up to a century. A member of the [[Sturgeon|Acipenseridae (sturgeon)]] family of fish that originated during the [[Cretaceous period]] 70&nbsp;million years ago, the pallid sturgeon has remained essentially unchanged. The species is considered to be a relic of the [[Triassic|dinosaur]] era, and has been called "one of the ugliest fish in North America".<ref name="dinosaur">{{cite web| title = The Pallid Sturgeon, a Missouri River "Dinosaur"| work = Feature Series, Vol I, No. 4| publisher = U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service| url = http://www.r6.fws.gov/feature/sturgeon.html| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}</ref>

In 1990, the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS) placed the pallid sturgeon on the endangered species list, because few young individuals had been observed in the preceding decade, and  sightings had greatly diminished;<ref name="endangered">{{cite web| title = Operation and Maintenance of the Upper Mississippi River 9-Foot Channel| work = Endangered Species Program| publisher = U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service| date = November 18, 2008| url = http://www.fws.gov/midwest/Endangered/section7/pallid.html| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}</ref> the species is now rarely seen in the wild. It was the first fish species in the Mississippi River drainage area to be listed as endangered, and  a loss of its habitat is thought to be responsible for its decline. The vast majority of the Mississippi River drainage system has been [[River engineering|channeled and dammed]], reducing the gravel deposits and slow-moving side channels that are its favored [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] areas. Until the middle of the 20th century, the pallid sturgeon was common and anglers found catching such a large fish in fresh water a rewarding experience. The species is considered to be good-tasting, and its eggs have been used as [[caviar]], although less commonly than those of many other sturgeon.<ref name="NRCS">{{cite web| title = Threatened and Endangered Species: Pallid Sturgeon Scaphirhynchus Fact Sheet | publisher = U.S. Department of Agriculture| date = November 16, 2005| url = http://www.mt.nrcs.usda.gov/news/factsheets/pallidsturgeon.html| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}</ref> 

Efforts to prevent the species from becoming extinct have had modest success. Pallid sturgeon are actively being raised in a dozen [[Fish hatchery|hatcheries]] and the offspring are being released back to the wild every year. To better understand pallid sturgeon behavior, researchers have implanted [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] transmitters to track their movements and help identify possible spawning areas. Federal and state agencies are working together to improve habitat by restoring spawning areas since restoration of these areas is required if the species is to survive in the wild.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==
Taxonomists [[Stephen Alfred Forbes|S.A. Forbes]] and R. E. Richardson classified the pallid sturgeon in 1905, grouping it in the ''[[Scaphirhynchus]]'' [[genus]] and the ''[[Acipenseridae]]'' [[Family (biology)|family]], which includes all [[sturgeon]] worldwide. The pallid sturgeon's closest relatives are the shovelnose sturgeon (''Scaphirhyncus platorhynchus''), which is still relatively common, and the critically endangered [[Alabama sturgeon]] (''Scaphirhynchus suttkusi''), which may soon become [[Extinction|extinct]].<ref name="AlabamaIUCN">{{IUCN2008| title=''Scaphirhynchus suttkusi'' | assessors=Parauka, F.M. |year=2004 | id=19942 | downloaded = 08 Dec 2008}}</ref><ref name="AlabamaSEFC">{{cite news | title = The Desperate Dozen: Fishes on the Brink | publisher = Southeastern Fishes Council | date = November, 2008 | url = http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/organizations/sfc/DesDoz_report.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 2008-12-09}}</ref> These three species belong to the ''[[Scaphirhynchinae]]'' subfamily which has only one other genera, namely the ''[[Pseudoscaphirhynchus]]'' genus, represented by three more fish species found in west-central [[Asia]].

The word ''pallid'' means "deficient in color",<ref name="Merriam">{{cite web| title = Pallid| work = | publisher = Merriam-Webster| year = 2008| url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pallid| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}</ref> and compared to other species of sturgeon, the pallid is noticeably paler.<ref name="Guide">{{cite web| title = Pallid Sturgeon| work = Animal Field Guide| publisher = Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks| url = http://fwp.mt.gov/fieldguide/detail_AFCAA02010.aspx| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}</ref> The scientific name for the fish is derived from ''Scaphirhynchus'', a Greek word meaning "spade snout" and ''albus'' which is [[Latin]] for the color white.<ref name="Riis">{{cite web| last = Riis| first = Jim| title = Pallid Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) | publisher = South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks| year = 1993| url = http://www.northern.edu/natsource/ENDANG1/Pallid1.htm| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}</ref>

== Biology ==
===DNA studies===
To better protect pallid sturgeons from extinction,  research on their [[DNA]] and that of other closely related species was conducted to assess the differences within various populations of pallid sturgeon, and the differences between them and shovelnose sturgeon. Early DNA research indicated that pallid sturgeon and shovelnose sturgeon were the same species.<ref name="Tranah1">{{cite journal| last = Tranah| first = G. J.| coauthors = D. E. Campton, and B. May | title = Genetic Evidence for Hybridization of Pallid and Shovelnose Sturgeon | journal = Journal of Heredity| volume = 95| issue = 6| pages = 474-480| publisher = The American Genetic Association| date = 2004| url = http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/95/6/474| doi = 10.1093/jhered/esh077| accessdate = 2008-12-14}}</ref> However in 2000, one study comparing DNA sequencing in all three species in the ''Scaphirhynchus'' genus (pallid, shovelnose and Alabama sturgeon) showed that the three species are distinct.<ref name="Campton">{{cite journal| last = Campton| first = Donald E.| coauthors = Anna L. Bass, Frank A. Chapman and Brian W. Bowen| title = Genetic distinction of pallid, shovelnose, and Alabama sturgeon: emerging species and the US Endangered Species Act| journal = Conservation Genetics| volume = 1| issue = 1| pages = 17-32| publisher = Springer Netherlands| location = | date = March 2000| url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/w76485t849537674/| doi = 10.1023/A:1010121417487| accessdate = 2008-12-14}}</ref> Between 2001 and 2006, several studies examined two populations of pallid sturgeon located in the upper [[Great Plains]] section of the Missouri River and compared them to those found in the lower Mississippi River. These DNA studies concluded that the northern populations of pallid sturgeon are [[Reproductive isolation|reproductively isolated]] and are genetically distinct from a southern population located in the [[Atchafalaya River]] in [[Louisiana]]. However, the genetic variability among pallid sturgeon was found to be far less than that between them and the shovelnose sturgeon.<ref name="Tranah2">{{cite journal| last = Tranah| first = G. J.| coauthors = H. L. Kincaid, C. C. Krueger, D. E. Campton, and B.

Another reason for DNA testing was to determine the rates of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] between pallid and shovelnose sturgeons. The southern populations have more hybrids than are found in the middle sections of the Missouri River basin, while the northernmost populations have had few reports of hybrids.<ref name="Billings"/> Hybrids are most common in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana and DNA sequencing in these hybrids showed a genetic distinction from pallid sturgeons, but based on the genetic markers assessed, they were genetically indistinguishable from shovelnose sturgeons.<ref name="Tranah2"/> Because of this ability of two species to hybridize, some biologists have expressed concern that it is a violation of the [[Endangered Species Act]] to protect one species that may not be genetically isolated from another.<ref name="Campton"/> It is not known if the hybrids are able to reproduce or not, although they appear to be the result of  pallid sturgeon eggs being fertilized by shovelnose sturgeon males.<ref name="Tranah1"/>

===Physical characteristics===
[[Image:Pallid Sturgeon head detail.JPG|thumb|right|Detail and measurement of head of a hatchery raised pallid sturgeon]]
The pallid sturgeon is one of the largest freshwater fish species in North America. They are generally between {{convert|30|and|60|in|cm}} in length and weigh as much as {{convert|85|lb|kg}}.<ref name="montana"/><ref name="Platte"/> The species is ancient and has remained virtually unchanged for 70&nbsp;million years, since the [[Cretaceous]] period. The pallid sturgeon has a distinctive appearance that has been referred to as "primitive", "dinosaur-like" and even "ugly".<ref name="dinosaur"/> Although visually similar, the shovelnose sturgeon is much smaller and usually weighs no more than {{convert|5|lb|kg}}. Pallid sturgeons are much paler in coloration with grayish white backs and sides, while shovelnose sturgeons are brown.<ref name="NRCS"/> Pallid sturgeons turn whiter as they age and younger specimens are easily confused with  adult shovelnoses sturgeon since they are similar in color.<ref name="Missouri">{{cite web| | title = Endangered Sturgeon Struggle for Survival | work = The Sturgeon of Missouri Missouri's Aquatic Dinosaurs| publisher = Conservation Commission of Missouri| year = 2008| url = http://mdc.mo.gov/fish/sport/sturgeon/info/| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}</ref> Like the shovelnose sturgeon, their tails are heterocercal, with the top tail fin being longer than the bottom fin, though this is  more pronounced in pallid sturgeons.<ref name="Johnsgard">{{cite book| last = Johnsgard| first = Paul A.| title = The Nature of Nebraska| publisher = Bison Books| date = April 1, 2005| location = Lincoln, Nebraska| pages = 169<U+2013>170| isbn = 978-0803276215}}</ref>

As with other sturgeons, pallid sturgeons are lacking the [[Scale (zoology)|scales]] or bones found in more modern species of fish. Instead, they have [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] skeletons with five rows of thick cartilage plates that extend along their sides, undersides and backs, as well as over most of the head. These thick cartilage plates are covered by the skin and serve as a protective armor.<ref name="Johnsgard"/>  The bony cartilage also extends along the backside, from the [[dorsal fin]] to the tail.<ref name="Riis"/> 

The pallid sturgeon's snout and head are longer than that of the shovelnose sturgeon.<ref name="Missouri"/> In both species, the mouth is located well back from the tip of the snout. Lacking teeth they use their extendable mouths to suck up small fish, [[mollusk]]s and other food sources from river bottoms. Both species also have four [[Barbel (anatomy)|barbel]]s which descend from the snout near the front of the mouth. The barbels are believed to be sensory features to locate food sources.<ref name="Johnsgard"/> On pallid sturgeons, the two inner barbels are approximately half as long as the outer ones, while on the shovelnose sturgeon, all four barbels are the same length.<ref name="NRCS"/> The inner barbels of the pallid sturgeon are positioned in front of the outer ones, whereby those on the shovelnose sturgeon are all located in essentially a straight line. The length and positioning of the barbels is one of the best ways to distinguish the two species.<ref name="Missouri"/>

===Reproduction and life cycle===
[[Image:Juvenilepallid.jpg|thumb|right|The immature larva of a pallid sturgeon being raised in a fish hatchery]] Pallid sturgeons have a long lifespan, living in excess of 50&nbsp;years and perhaps as long as 100&nbsp;years.<ref name="NWF">{{cite web| title = Upper Missouri Pallid Sturgeon| publisher = National Wildlife Federation| url = http://www.nwf.org/endangered/pdfs/UM-PallidSturgeon.pdf| format = pdf| accessdate =2008-11-19}}</ref><ref name="Burton">{{cite web| last =Burton | first =Ken | title = New Hope for the Pallid Sturgeon| work = Endangered Species Bulletin| publisher = U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service| date = January/April 2000| url = http://www.fws.gov/endangered//bulletin/2000/01-04/04-05.pdf| format = pdf| accessdate =2008-11-19}}</ref><ref name="Gavins">{{cite web | title = Abnormal Cells found in Pallid Sturgeon at Gavins Point National Fish Hatchery Prohibit Stocking these Fish in the Wild| publisher = U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service| date = September 26, 2007| url = http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/PRESSREl/07-61.htm| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}</ref> They lack bones and scales which makes it more difficult to establish their age and determine exactly how long they live.<ref name="Holm">{{cite web| last = Holm | first = Rob|title = Prehistoric Presence The Pallid Sturgeon| publisher = North Dakota Outdoors| date = April-May 2002| url = http://gf.nd.gov/multimedia/ndoutdoors/issues/2002/apr-may/docs/sturgeon.pdf| format = pdf| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}</ref>  As is true for many long-lived species, pallid sturgeons reach reproductive maturity relatively late.<ref name="EPA">{{cite web| title = Status and Life History of the Pallid Sturgeon| publisher = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency| date = August 31, 2007| url = http://www.epa.gov/espp/litstatus/effects/appendix_c_life_history_sturgeon.pdf| format = pdf| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}</ref> Males reach sexual maturity between the ages of 5 and 7&nbsp;years, while females are believed to become capable of reproduction when they are at least 15&nbsp;years old.

For several decades, no natural reproduction of pallid sturgeons was observed, since all the pallid sturgeons that had been captured were older specimens. However, in the late 1990s, young pallid sturgeons were discovered living in a restored riparian area of the lower Missouri River. This was the first documented example of wild spawned pallid sturgeons in 50&nbsp;years.<ref name="Burton"/> In 2007, two female pallid sturgeons were also reported to have spawned in the [[Missouri National Recreational River]] area located downstream from [[Gavins Point Dam]] on the Missouri River.<ref name="USGS">{{cite web| title = Sturgeon Research Update: Confirmed Pallid sturgeon Sturgeon Spawning in the Missouri River in 2007| publisher = U.S. Geological Survey| month = July | year = 2007| url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2007/3053/pdf/FS2007-3053.pdf| format = pdf| accessdate =2008-11-19}}</ref>

===Distribution===
The pallid sturgeon's historical range spanned the entire Missouri and into the Mississippi Rivers.  Historically, the species was  rare to nonexistent in the upper Mississippi, probably due to a lack of proper habitat.  Currently, the species is  considered critically imperiled throughout its entire range.<ref name="Louisiana">{{cite web| title = Pallid Sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus)| publisher = Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries| url = http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/pdfs/experience/naturalheritage/rareanimal/Pallid_Sturgeon-Scaphirhynchus_albus.pdf| format = pdf| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}</ref>  As of 2008, pallid sturgeons can still be found throughout their original range, but their population numbers have severely declined from  the mid 20th century. The Missouri and Mississippi Rivers from [[Montana]] to Louisiana, as well as the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana,  continue to harbor an aging population of pallid sturgeons.<ref name="EPA"/> Pallid sturgeons have never been very common;  as early as 1905 when the species was first identified, they represented only 1 in 5 of all sturgeon in the lower Missouri River and as few as 1 in 500 where the [[Illinois River]] meets the Mississippi.<ref name="Grady">{{cite web| last = Grady| first = Joanne| coauthors = Jim Milligan| title = Pallid and Shovelnose Sturgeon in the Lower Missouri and Middle Mississippi Rivers | publisher = U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service| month = February | year = 2001| url = http://www.fws.gov/midwest/columbiafisheries/documents/MICRA_sturgeon_report.pdf| format = pdf| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}</ref> Recently, between 1985 and 2000, the ratio of pallid sturgeons to all sturgeon netted declined from 1 in about 400 to 1 in nearly 650. A 1996 study concluded that between 6,000 and 21,000 pallid sturgeons remained in their natural habitat at that time.<ref name="IUCN">{{cite web| title = Scaphirhynchus albus | work = The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species| publisher = International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources| year = 2004| url = http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/19940/all| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}</ref>

Six areas were studied for wild pallid sturgeon population estimates and recovery recommendations by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]  between 1990, when the species was declared endangered, and 2006. The USFWS has referred to these six areas of wild pallid sturgeon population studies as Recovery Priority Management Areas (RPMA's). In the northernmost region of the study, known as RPMA 1, located between the [[Marias River]] in Montana to the western reaches of Fort Peck Reservoir, only 45 wild (non-hatchery) individuals remain. Of these, no juveniles were observed and the population was declining. In RPMA 2, located between Fort Peck Dam, the headwaters of [[Lake Sakakawea]] and the lower Yellowstone River up to the confluence of the [[Tongue River (Montana)|Tongue River]], Montana, only 136 wild specimens remain. In RPMA 3, stretching from upstream of the [[Niobrara River]] to [[Lewis and Clark Lake]] along the Missouri River, no native populations were recorded. All collected specimens appeared to be hatchery raised. However, the hatchery raised specimens were apparently maturing and adjusting well to this section of the river. RPMA 4 extends from Gavins Point Dam to the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. This region also includes the Platte River. Here, at least 100 unique non-hatchery specimens were collected during the study period. There is also evidence that some wild reproduction is ongoing in this region. In RPMA 5, between the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi and the [[Gulf of Mexico]], several hundred specimens were documented. Here again, some evidence suggests that natural reproduction is occurring, as demonstrated by the recovery of a few examples of immature, non-hatchery raised individuals. The Atchafalaya River basin is designated as RPMA 6 and the findings there were similar to those in Recovery Priority Management Areas 4 and 5 but with greater numbers of unique individuals, near 500 in total.<ref name="Billings"/>

===Habitat===
Pallid sturgeons prefer moderate to swift river currents and most captured specimens have been recovered in rivers and streams in which the current averages between {{convert|0.33|and|2.9|ft/s|m/s}}. They also prefer [[Turbidity|turbid]] waterways and water depths between {{convert|3|and|25|ft|m}}. The species is more commonly found where sandy substrates are plentiful but also lives in waterways that are predominately rocky. Pallid sturgeons prefer swift river currents more often than do shovelnose sturgeon.<ref name="EPA"/> 

In a study based in Montana and [[North Dakota]] conducted on both the pallid and shovelnose sturgeon, both species were fitted with radio transmitters so researchers could track their swimming habits. Pallid sturgeons were found to prefer wider river channels, mid-channel sandbars and numerous islands and were most commonly recorded in water depths between {{convert|2|and|47|ft|m}}. The study also showed that the pallid sturgeon moved as much as {{convert|13|mi|km}} a day and up to {{convert|5.7|mi/h|km/h}}.<ref name="Bramblett">{{cite journal| last = Bramblett| first = Robert| coauthors = Robert White| title = Habitat Use and Movements of Pallid and Shovelnose Sturgeon in the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers in Montana and North Dakota| journal = Transactions of the American Fisheries Society | volume = 130| issue = 6| pages = 1006<U+2013>1025| publisher = American Fisheries Society| location = Bethesda, Maryland| year = 2001| accessdate =2008-11-19}}</ref> Pallid sturgeon are believed to have  preferred the muddy and generally warmer waters that existed prior to Missouri River dam construction.<ref name="McKean"/>

===Food preferences===
Pallid sturgeons are generally [[bottom feeder]]s, skimming the sandy reaches of the various rivers and streams in their habitat. Though little is known about the precise eating habits of the species, they are thought to be opportunistic feeders.<ref name="EPA"/> One study which examined the contents from the stomachs of juvenile pallid sturgeons revealed that their diets were seasonally dependent. Various insects were consumed during some seasons and various fish species during others. These results support the description of the pallid sturgeons'  eating habits as opportunistic.<ref name="Wanner">{{cite journal| last =Wanner | first = Greg| coauthors = D. A. Shuman, and D. W.

The route and the environmental characteristics of  Missouri River in the northern [[Great Plains]] states of North and [[South Dakota]], [[Nebraska]] and Montana, have been significantly altered. The resultant changes to the Missouri River in the upper Great Plains from channelization and impoundment prevent upstream migration. The reduced water flow rates and sediment loads and has brought an end to the seasonal flooding of the flood plains in the region. Since the construction of the [[Fort Peck Dam]] in Montana in 1937, and subsequent damming and channelization, the Missouri river has lost over 90&nbsp;percent of its wetland and sandbar ecosystems. More than {{convert|2000|mi|km}} of the Missouri River has been altered and only that stretch of the river above Fort Peck Reservoir in Montana remains relatively unchanged.<ref name="Power">{{cite web| last = Power| first = Greg| title = The Missouri River System's "Other" Fish | publisher = U.

In the 13 [[U.S. state]]s that the pallid sturgeon is found, only a few other fish species are listed as endangered.<ref name="Tess">{{cite web| title = How many species are listed in each state (based on published population data)?| work = Threatened & Endangered Species System| publisher = U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service| date = 2008| url = http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/StateListing.do?state=all| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}</ref> Although substantial efforts are being implemented to ensure the survival of this species, the rarity of self-sustaining populations of pallid sturgeons ensures that it will remain federally protected for many decades. 

===Efforts to preserve the species from extinction===
Two populations of pallid sturgeons in the Missouri and [[Yellowstone River]]s of Montana are both at risk of extinction and current projections are that wild pallid sturgeon populations in Montana will be extinct by 2018.<ref name="montana"/> Though a vigorous stocking effort was implemented in 1996, until pallid sturgeon females reach reproductive maturity sometime after they are 15&nbsp;years of age, recovery efforts in Montana will not be readily measurable. The [[U.S. Bureau of Reclamation]] has been conducting spring pulse water releases from the [[Tiber dam]] every four to five&nbsp;years to try and recreate a semblance of an annual spring flood to restore and rejuvenate downstream floodplains. These pulse releases are done in an effort to restore suitable habitat for numerous fish species.<ref name="montana2">{{cite web| title = Pallid Sturgeon <U+2014> Scaphirhynchus albus| publisher = State of Montana| url = http://fieldguide.mt.gov/detail_AFCAA02010.aspx| accessdate =2008-11-19 }}</ref>

In Nebraska, a small number of pallid sturgeons have been captured along the lower reaches of the [[Platte River]]. Unlike most rivers in the Mississippi-Missouri river system, the Platte River has only a few dams and they are well upstream from its confluence with the Missouri River. The lower Platte River is shallow with numerous sand bars and small islands. Though pallid sturgeons prefer more turbulent and deeper rivers than the Platte River, between 1979 and 2003 over a dozen pallid sturgeons, including some from hatcheries, have been captured from the Platte River.<ref name="Platte2">{{cite book| last = Committee on Endangered and Threatened Species in the Platte River Basin| title = Endangered and Threatened Species of the Platte River| publisher = The National Academies Press| date = 2004| location = Washington, D. C.| pages = 225<U+2013>239| url = http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10978&page=225| isbn = 978-0-309-09230-2}}</ref> A number of these pallid sturgeons have been fitted with [[Tracking animal migration|radio transmitters]] which track their return to the Platte River when water levels and turbidity conditions are favorable. Coinciding with the majority of the pallid sturgeons that have been captured, this period that is generally most favorable is during the spring and early summer months. By mid-summer, a reduction in water levels and turbidity on the Platte River encourages pallid sturgeons to return to the Missouri River. 

The lower reaches of the Platte River, a more than 30-mile (48 km) stretch from the [[Elkhorn River]] to its confluence with the Missouri River, has suitable spawning habitat for pallid sturgeons, although no conclusive evidence has been found that spawning is occurring in this region.<ref name="Platte2"/> Along with the lower Yellowstone River, the lower Platte River was identified as one of the best of the remaining regions with the potential for the  natural spawning.<ref name="Billings"/> In an effort to help restore habitat, two large river water pulse releases are planned for the months of March and May 2009 from Gavins Point Dam, located on the border of Nebraska and South Dakota. Although the amount of water released from the dam will be dependent on both upstream reservoir levels and downstream river levels, and will be regulated to ensure that downstream flooding will not occur,  some restoration of the historic ebb and flow of the river will occur and that will benefit the spawning of the pallid sturgeon.<ref name="Herald">{{cite news | last = Hendee| first = David| title = Missouri River plan calls for '09 water pulses| publisher = ''Omaha World Herald''| date = October 3, 2009| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}</ref> 

In Missouri, at the Lisbon Bottoms section of the [[Big Muddy National Fish & Wildlife Refuge]], wild pallid sturgeon larvae were collected in 1998. These non-hatchery raised larvae were the first recovered on the lower Missouri River in the previous 50&nbsp;years. The recovery was made along a side channel of the Missouri River that had been developed to provide suitable habitat for pallid sturgeon and other fish spawning.<ref name="Ikenson">{{cite news | last = Ikenson| first = Ben | title = Biologists struggle to keep the pallid sturgeon from going extinct | work = Reviving the Missouri River's dinosaur| publisher = ''ESPN''| date = May 31, 2006| url = http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/general/columns/story?columnist=guest_columnist&page=c_col_Ikenson_sturgeon_pallid| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}</ref> The side channel was apparently being used by the larva pallid sturgeons for protection from the swifter currents of the Missouri River.<ref name="Mississippi">{{cite web| title = Pallid Sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus albus| publisher = Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Association| url = http://wwwaux.cerc.cr.usgs.gov/MICRA/PALLIDST.HTM| accessdate = 2008-11-19}}</ref> 

In 2007, the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concluded that hatchery-based reproduction efforts should be continued, along with monitoring of any population changes, to determine the effectiveness of human intervention. The 2007 findings also emphasized the need to determine the most likely areas of spawning, to identify  any parasite or disease that may be impacting the reproductive capabilities of pallid sturgeon and to examine engineering possibilities that may permit recreation of suitable habitats without reducing the USFWS ability to protect people from harmful and destructive flooding, and to  maintain its ability to provide adequate water impoundment for irrigation and recreation purposes.<ref name="Billings"/>
