'''RAF Northolt''' {{airport codes|NHT|EGWU}} is a [[Royal Air Force]] station {{convert|3.7|km|abbr=on}} northwest<ref name="aip"/> of [[Uxbridge]] in the [[London Borough of Hillingdon]], West London, UK. Approximately {{Convert|10|km|abbr=on}} north of [[London Heathrow Airport]], the station also handles a large number of private civilian flights.<ref name=AboutusRAF>{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafnortholt/aboutus/ |title=RAF Northolt - About us |author=Royal Air Force |date=Date not specified |work= |publisher=Royal Air Force |accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref>

Northolt pre-dates the establishment of the Royal Air Force by almost three years. Originally established for the use of the [[Royal Flying Corps]], it has the longest history of continuous use of any RAF airfield. The station played a key role during the [[Battle of Britain]] when fighters from several squadrons including [[No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron]] engaged enemy aircraft as part of the defence of [[London]]. Before World War II broke out, the station had been the first to take delivery of the [[Hawker Hurricane]]. Later in the war it became the first to have squadrons operating [[Supermarine Spitfire]] aircraft within German airspace.

During construction of Heathrow Airport, Northolt was used for civil flights, becoming for a time the busiest airport in Europe and a major base for [[British European Airways]]. More recently the station has become the hub of British military operations in the London area with services transferring from other stations. Northolt has been extensively redeveloped since 2006 to accommodate these changes, becoming home to the [[British Forces Post Office]] which moved to a newly constructed headquarters and sorting office on the site. RAF squadrons including [[No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron RAF]] are based at RAF Northolt whilst its location close to the [[A40 road|A40]] road link with central London has made the station popular with businesspeople and politicans.

===Construction===
Following [[Louis Bl<U+00E9>riot]]'s first flight across the [[English Channel]] in 1909, the [[British Army]] considered the necessity of defending the United Kingdom from a future air attack. By May 1910, [[Claude Grahame-White]] and other aviation pioneers were flying from the flat areas around [[Ruislip]]. They then sought an aerodrome for London which was eventually built at [[Hendon Aerodrome|Hendon]]. A proposal was made in 1912 for the area around where RAF Northolt now stands to be developed as "Harrow Aerodrome". The company established to develop the site was listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] but the proposal did not progress any further.<ref name="Bristow">{{cite book |title=A History of Royal Air Force Northolt |last=Bristow |first=Mark |authorlink= |coauthors=Laidlow-Petersen, Sylvia |year=2005 |publisher=No. 1 AIDU |location=RAF Northolt |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>

The [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] in 1914 and the ensuing [[World War I|First World War]] led to the need for a new aerodrome for the [[Royal Flying Corps]]. The Corps had received the [[Royal Warrant of Appointment|Royal Warrant]] on 13 April 1912, whereupon Major [[Sefton Brancker]] of the [[War Office]] conducted aerial surveys in 1914 of Glebe Farm in [[Ickenham]], Hundred Acres Farm and Down Barnes Farm looking for the most effective operating base for new squadrons. He settled on a site near Northolt Junction railway station but it was not until January 1915 that the British Government officially requisitioned the land. It is rumoured that the Government official tasked with acquiring the land arrived at the site with his map upside down, leading to the Government requisitioning and developing land on the wrong side of the railway line,<ref name="Bristow"/> including the old Hill Farm.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ickenham and Harefield Past |last=Bowlt |first=Eileen.

Construction of the new aerodrome, to be named "RFC Military School, Ruislip", began in January 1915. It opened on 3 May 1915, becoming known as Northolt and home to No. 4 Reserve Aeroplane Squadron which relocated from [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]]. The airfield took on the Northolt name despite being situated in neighbouring [[South Ruislip]]. Most early RAF airfields were named after the nearest railway station, in this case [[South Ruislip station|South Ruislip]], known at that time as Northolt Junction (later Northolt Halt). Later the same year the airfield was extended westwards and aircraft began flying sorties in defence of London against [[Zeppelin]] raids. [[No. 18 Squadron RAF|No. 18 Squadron]] was formed in the same month as Northolt was established, flying Bleriot Experimental biplanes criticised for their slow speed and which suffered heavy losses against the German Air Force.<ref name="Bristow"/>

In 1916, No. 43 Squadron was formed under the command of Major [[Sholto Douglas]]. Aircraft built by the [[Fairey Aviation]] company, then situated in [[Hayes, Hillingdon|Hayes]], were used by the squadron, including the [[Sopwith 1<U+00BD> Strutter]]. The Strutter made its first test flight from Northolt in 1916 with [[Harry Hawker]] at the controls.<ref name="Bristow"/> Test flights continued until 1928 when the [[Air Ministry]] gave the company notice to cease using Northolt. Flights later resumed from the [[Great West Aerodrome]] owned by Fairey in [[Harmondsworth]] which was eventually developed as Heathrow Airport.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/609photos/Northolt.htm |title=Northolt |author=609 West Riding Archives|date=11 April 2003 |work= |publisher=609 West Riding Archives |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref> No. 43 later went on to fly sorties over [[France]] from 17 January 1917, taking part in the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] between 4 and 8 April 1917.<ref name="Bristow"/>

[[No. 600 Squadron RAF|No. 600 Squadron]] and [[No. 601 Squadron RAF|No. 601 Squadron]] of the newly formed [[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]] were formed at Northolt in 1925 under the command of [[Squadron Leader]] Lord Edward Grosvenor. Both squadrons later deployed to [[RAF Hendon]] in 1927 although 600 Squadron returned in 1939. The [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], later King Edward VIII and subsequently the [[Duke of Windsor]], made his first flight in a [[Bristol F.2 Fighter]] from Northolt on 27 April 1929.<ref name="Bristow"/>

In the lead up to the Second World War the RAF began a policy of adding concrete runways to important airfields. By 1939 Northolt had switched to this format, with a runway 800 by 50 yards long.<ref>Birtles 2010, p. 37.</ref> Later in 1939, [[RAF Hendon]] became one of its satellite airfields.<ref>Birtles 2010, p. 58.</ref>

Northolt became an active base for [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] and [[Polish Air Forces in Great Britain|Polish Air Force]] squadrons during the Second World War in the defence of the [[United Kingdom]]. It was the first RAF station to operate the [[Hawker Hurricane]], with [[No. 111 Squadron RAF|No. 111 Squadron]] receiving the first four aircraft in December 1937,<ref>Bader 2004, p. 41.</ref><ref name=RAFhistory>{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafnortholt/aboutus/history.cfm |title=RAF Northolt - History of RAF Northolt |author=[[Royal Air Force]] |date=Date not specified |work= |publisher=[[Royal Air Force]] |accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref> and reaching a full complement by February 1938.<ref name="Bickers">{{cite book |title=Battle of Britain |last=Townshend Bickers |first=Richard |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1990 |publisher=Salamander Books |location=London |isbn=0-86101-477-4 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=10 March 2011}}</ref> In 1943 the station became the first to fly sorties using [[Supermarine Spitfire]] Mk.

On 15 September 1940 during the [[Battle of Britain]], No. 1 Squadron [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]], [[No. 229 Squadron RAF|No. 229 Squadron]], [[No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron]], [[No. 504 Squadron RAF|No. 504 Squadron]], and part of [[No. 264 Squadron RAF|No.264 Squadron]] were based at the station, all under the control of [[No. 11 Group RAF]], based at [[RAF Uxbridge]].<ref name="Bickers"/> All flew [[Hawker Hurricane]]s except No. 264 Squadron's contingent which operated the [[Boulton Paul Defiant]]. No. 303 During the Battle of Britain the Polish Squadron downed the highest number of enemy aircraft with its Czech pilot Sergeant Josef Frantisek "scoring" the most kills.<ref name=RAFhistory/> The [[Luftwaffe]] bombed the airfield in August 1940 as well as other sector airfields in the area including [[RAF Biggin Hill|Biggin Hill]], [[RAF Hornchurch|Hornchurch]] and [[RAF North Weald|North Weald]] as part of a concentrated effort against airfields and sector stations of [[No. 11 Group RAF]].<ref name="Bickers"/> Under the leadership of the Station Commander [[Group Captain]] Stanley Vincent, the airfield was camouflaged to resemble civilian housing. A stream was painted across the main runway, while the hangars were painted with houses and gardens.<ref name="Bowlt"/> 

The remains of a [[Hawker Hurricane]] flown by Flying Officer Ludwik Witold Paszkiewicz, the first pilot in No. 303 Squadron to shoot down an enemy aircraft, were donated to the station in June 2008. Paszkiewicz became a [[flying ace]] and was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] after shooting down six aircraft, before he himself was shot down and killed on 27 September 1940, over [[Borough Green]] in [[Kent]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Hurricane Mk1 No L1696 back at RAF Northolt |first=Chris |last=Longhurst |url=http://www.uxbridgegazette.co.uk/west-london-news/uxbridge-history/2008/06/16/hurricane-mk1-no-l1696-back-at-raf-northolt-113046-21082933/ |newspaper=Uxbridge Gazette |date=16 June 2008 |accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref> No. 303 Squadron recorded its 100th kill less than a month after commencing operations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theartsdesk.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=1755:bloody-foreigners-untold-battle-of-britain-c4&Itemid=31 |title=Bloody Foreigners: The Untold Battle of Britain, Channel 4 |author=Adam Sweeting |date= |work= |publisher=The Arts Desk |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref> Polish pilot Squadron Leader Franciszek Kornicki, who saw wartime service at RAF Northolt, was reunited with the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] he had flown at a special ceremony in September 2010.<ref>{{cite news |title=Battle of Britain veteran Franciszek Kornicki reunited with spitfire at RAF Northolt

Thirty [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] airmen including servicemen from [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Poland]] and the United Kingdom were killed flying from RAF Northolt during the [[Battle of Britain]]. Of these, 10 were Polish. The [[Polish War Memorial]] dedicated to all Polish airmen who lost their lives in the Second World War stands near the southeastern corner of the airfield. Its name is also commemorated at the adjacent eponymous junction on [[Western Avenue (London)|Western Avenue]]. <ref name="WarMemorial">{{cite web |url=http://www2.ealing.gov.uk/services/leisure/local_history/historic_buildings/polish_war_memorial.html |title=Polish War Memorial |author=[[London Borough of Ealing]] |date= |work= |publisher=[[London Borough of Ealing]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref> An additional memorial to British, Polish and [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZAC) aircrew killed during the Battle of Britain was unveiled in September 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coulonstone.com/memorials/raf-northolt |title=RAF Northolt |author=Coulon Stone |date=11 February 2011 |work= |publisher=Coulon Stone |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>

Squadrons based at RAF Northolt throughout the battle shot down a total of 148 [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft and damaged 52. A further 25 were claimed by pilots and recorded as "probables". After the Battle of Britain, the station remained a day fighter base, with [[No. 302 Polish Fighter Squadron]], [[No. 229 Squadron RAF|No. 229 Squadron]] and [[No. 615 Squadron RAF|No. 615 Squadron]] all arriving before 3 November 1940. [[No. 308 Polish Fighter Squadron]] and [[No. 306 Polish Fighter Squadron]] later joined No. 303 during 1941 to form the No. 1 Polish Fighter Wing. Polish Fighter Squadrons based at Northolt in 1942 took part in [[Operation Jubilee]] on 19 August alongside Nos. 302 and 308 from nearby [[RAF Heston]]. Reconnaissance squadrons [[No. 16 Squadron RAF|No.16 Squadron]] and [[No. 140 Squadron RAF|No. 140 Squadron]] operating [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] and [[de Havilland Mosquito]]s moved to Northolt in 1944. [[No. 69 Squadron RAF|No. 69 Squadron]] with their [[Vickers Wellington]]s modified for photographic reconnaissance arrived later. All three reconnaissance squadrons were combined to form No. 34 (PR) Wing.<ref name="Bristow"/>
One of Northolt's commanders, [[Group Captain]] Stanley Vincent, shot down an enemy aircraft, making him one of the few RAF airmen to shoot down an enemy aircraft in both [[World Wars]].<ref>Birtles 2010, pp. 50-51.</ref>

On 25 March 1943, [[RAF Ferry Command]] became [[RAF Transport Command]] and began to use Northolt as a London base for the transfer of new aircraft from factories to stations. Runway 26/08 had been extended in February that year to accommodate the larger transport aircraft required by the Command. The smaller 02/20 runway subsequently closed in April 1944. 

Northolt continued as a Sector Fighter Station until February 1944.<ref name="Bristow"/>

During the war, RAF Northolt was home to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]'s personal aircraft, a modified [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster]]. The aircraft was delivered in June 1944 and used to fly him to meetings with other [[Allies of World War II|Allied leaders]].<ref name="Bristow"/> In October 2010, the hangar which housed the aircraft, the former Squadron Watch office and the Operations Block were given [[Listed building|Grade II listed buillding status]].<ref name="DCMS">{{cite web |url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/news/news_stories/7521.aspx |title=Key buildings at RAF Northolt listed |author=[[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]|date=28 October 2010 |work= |publisher=[[HM Government]] |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref> The Operations Block was a prototype of the "[[Hugh Dowding, 1st Baron Dowding|Dowding]] System", used for the first time during the Battle of Britain, which allowed the chain of command to communicate in order to intercept enemy aircraft. Prior to the listing, it was renamed the Sir [[Keith Park]] Building in honour of the No. 11 Group RAF commander.<ref>{{cite news |title=Historic buildings listed at RAF Northolt |first= |last= |url=http://www.hillingdontimes.co.uk/news/8494620.Historic_buildings_listed_at_RAF_Northolt/ |newspaper=Hillingdon & Uxbridge Times |date=4 November 2010 |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>

Between 20 and 21 July 1944, a converted [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] bomber named "Marco Polo" made the first non-stop intercontinental flight, flying from London to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and returning to Northolt from [[La Guardia Airport]] within 18 hours. In November of the same year, an [[Avro York]] flew non-stop from Northolt to [[Cairo]] in 10 hours and 25 minutes. A new runway, 31/13 was surveyed the following month and eventually built in March 1946.<ref name="Bristow"/>

===Later civil and military use===
Soon after the Second World War, in 1946, the airfield was loaned for civil aviation during construction of [[Heathrow Airport]] and became a significant civilian airport.<ref name=RAFhistory/> During this period Northolt became a major base for [[British European Airways]], which used the nearby Bourne School as its headquarters. Other airlines including [[Aer Lingus]], [[Alitalia]], [[Scandinavian Airlines System]] and [[Swissair]] all used the airfield for scheduled services across [[Europe]]. By 1952 the airfield was the busiest in Europe, with an annual total of 50,000 air movements.<ref name="Thompson"/> The RAF maintained a presence at the airfield throughout its use by civilian airlines. This makes it the longest continually used airfield in the history of the Royal Air Force.<ref name="Bristow"/> Civil flights ceased when the central area at Heathrow opened in 1954 with Northolt reverting to sole military use in May of that year.<ref name=RAFhistory/> 

In December 1946, after taking off during a heavy snowstorm, a [[Douglas DC-3]] operated by [[British European Airways]] flying from Northolt to [[Glasgow]] crashed onto the roof of two houses in [[South Ruislip]]. All the crew and passengers escaped unharmed by climbing through the loft of the house and leaving via the front door. No residents were injured, even though the owner of the house next door was standing at her front gate when the aircraft came down. The owners of the house had not moved in at the time of the crash as they were due to be married a few days later. The house was later named "Dakota Rest" after the Douglas DC-3's wartime operational name, and still stands today.<ref name="Bowlt">{{cite book |title=Ruislip Past |last=Bowlt |first=Eileen.

On 10 January 1952, a [[Douglas DC-3]] (actually a civilianised ex-military Dakota) operated by [[Aer Lingus]] and named "St. Kevin" was en route from Northolt to [[Dublin]]. It flew into a [[Lee wave|mountain wave]] triggered by [[Snowdon]] and an area of extreme turbulence, then crashed in a peat bog near [[Llyn Gwynant]] in [[Snowdonia]], killing all 20 passengers and 3 crew. It was the company's first fatal accident.<ref>"[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19520110-0 10 Jan 1952 Douglas C-47B-35-DK Dakota 3]." ''[[Aviation Safety Network]]''.

No. 1 Aeronautical Information Documents Unit moved to the station in 1956 from the neighbouring [[RAF West Ruislip]] station.<ref name=RAFhistory/>

Upon the opening of the much larger civilian airport at Heathrow, RAF Northolt became operationally constrained by its close proximity. On 1 June 1960, an [[Avro Anson]] aircraft suffered engine failure soon after take-off from Northolt and crash-landed on top of the nearby [[Express Dairies]] plant in [[South Ruislip]]. There were no fatalities.<ref name="Bristow"/> Later that year, on 25 October, a [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] [[Boeing 707]], heading for Heathrow, mistakenly landed at Northolt with forty one passengers on board.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abpic.co.uk/photo/1001607/ |title=Boeing 707-321, N725PA, Pan American World Airways (PA / PAA) |author=George Trussell|date=25 October 1960 |work= |publisher=George Trussell Collection |accessdate=10 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thirdamendment.com/wrongway.html |title=The Legacy of Douglas Corrigan: "Wrong Way" Landings By Commercial Airliners |author=Jol A.

In the days before navigational aids such as [[Instrument Landing System|instrument landing system]] (ILS) and the [[Global Positioning System|global positioning system]] (GPS) were available, the letters ''NO'' (for Northolt) and ''LH'' (for Heathrow) were painted on two [[gasometer]]s situated on the approach to each airfield, one at [[Southall]] for the approach to Heathrow's diagonal runway (coded 23L) and one at South Harrow for the approach to Northolt's runway (then coded 26), in an effort to prevent a recurrence of such errors.<ref name="Bristow"/> By the 1980s movements of privately-owned aircraft, mainly corporate jets, outnumbered military aircraft. Civilian flights were limited to 28 per day,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hillingdon.gov.uk/index.jsp?articleid=16412 |title=RAF Northolt |author=[[London Borough of Hillingdon]]|date= |work= |publisher=[[London Borough of Hillingdon]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref> with an annual maximum of 7,000 a year.

Northolt received its first [[gate guardian]], a Spitfire Mk XXII, in September 1963. Purchased from the RAF in 1969 for use in the film ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]'', it was replaced by a Spitfire Mk XVI on 2 June 1970, an aircraft which remained at the station until its removal on 8 September 1989 and restoration to full flying condition. The Kermit Weeks' Fantasy of Flight Museum in [[Polk City, Florida|Polk City]], [[Florida]] purchased the aircraft with the station receiving a [[fibreglass]] replica of a Spitfire Mk IX as a replacement.<ref name="Bristow"/>

Servicing of [[No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron RAF|No. 32 Squadron]] passed from the RAF to the private company Fields Aviation Services in April 1985 then to Lovaux Aircraft Servicing in 1990. In 1991 the Station Flight was established, taking delivery of two [[Britten-Norman Islanders]] in December which entered service in January 1992. No. 32 Squadron celebrated its [[Diamond Jubilee]] in 1991, while personnel became involved in operations during the [[Gulf War]]. [[No. 38 Group RAF]] assumed control of RAF Northolt on 2 November 1992 following a wider restructuring of the RAF. On 16 December 1994, the new southside Operations Building was opened, replacing the old Northolt Airport Terminal building. With the reorganisation of [[RAF Strike Command]] on 1 April 2000, No. 38 Group was disbanded and Northolt came under the control of [[No. 2 Group RAF]].<ref name="Bristow"/>

In August 1996, a Spanish [[Learjet]] operated by Mar Aviation overshot runway 25 and collided with a van heading eastward on the [[A40 road|A40]] Western Avenue; the aircraft was carrying an actress bound for [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]. The two pilots, the actress and van driver all had minor injuries but there were no fatalities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uxbridgegazette.co.uk/west-london-news/uxbridge-history/2008/06/16/when-the-learjet-came-down-it-really-was-a-case-of-hold-the-front-page-113046-21082526/

Subsequently, after some thirty years of protracted consideration, an ILS was eventually fitted to Northolt's redefined Runway 25. In addition, aggregate-filled safety pits were installed at each end of the runway by 21 January 1998 to protect road users in the event of another [[business jet]] or military transport failing to stop or ascend before the end of the runway.<ref name="Bristow"/> The [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Transport Select Committee]] considered the conversion of RAF Northolt to a possible off-shoot of Heathrow Airport in the 1990s. While the existing runways would cause aircraft to cross the flightpaths of those using Heathrow, new parallel runways were suggested.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1998/jun/30/raf-northolt |title=RAF Northolt |author=[[Hansard]] |date=30 June 1998 |work= |publisher=[[Hansard]] |accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref> These suggestions were opposed by then [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Ruislip-Northwood (UK Parliament constituency)|Ruislip-Northwood]], [[John Wilkinson (British politician)|John Wilkinson]], and eventually progressed no further.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.centreforaviation.com/news/2011/02/11/britains-endangered-airports/page1 |title=Britain<U+2019>s airports battle for passengers, airlines ... and survival |author=Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation |date=11 February 2011 |work= |publisher=Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation |accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref>

===Project MoDEL redevelopment===
[[File:RAF Northolt entrance June 2008 - geograph-2084686.jpg|thumb|right|The entrance to RAF Northolt in 2008, prior to redevelopment.]]
The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] launched [[Project MoDEL]] (Ministry of Defence Estates London) in 2006 to consolidate many of its [[London]] based operations at RAF Northolt. As a result, Northolt has been extensively redeveloped with new facilities for these operations.

[[RAF Bentley Priory]], [[RAF Uxbridge]], [[RAF West Ruislip]], [[RAF Eastcote]] and Inglis Barracks in [[Mill Hill]] were all closed between 2007 and 2010 with units gradually transferring to Northolt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vsmestates.co.uk/schemes_northolt.htm |title=RAF Northolt |author=VSM Estates Limited |date=Date not specified |work= |publisher=VSM Estates Limited |accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref>

Refurbishment of the original 1920s Officers' Mess took place in collaboration with [[English Heritage]] and reopened in June 2009.<ref>{{cite news |title=RAF Northolt celebrates re-opening of Officers' Mess |first=Charlene |last=Mitchell |url=http://ruislip.uxbridgegazette.co.uk/2009/06/raf-northolt-celebrates-re-ope.html |newspaper=Uxbridge Gazette |date=23 June 2009 |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref> 

The [[Air Historical Branch]], originally established in 1919 to provide a record of air activity during the First World War I, relocated to RAF Northolt from RAF Bentley Priory as part of Project MoDEL.<ref>{{cite news |title=Closing ceremony for Bentley Priory |first=Nadia |last=Sarbout |url=http://www.harrowtimes.co.uk/news/1566901.closing_ceremony_for_bentley_priory/ |newspaper=Harrow Times |date=24 July 2007 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
Due to its proximity to several film studios including those at [[Pinewood Studios|Pinewood]], the airfield has been used to represent outside locations in a number of feature films. The [[James Bond]] films ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' and ''[[Octopussy]]'' were all filmed at Northolt with station personnel serving as extras in the ''Octopussy'' hangar fly-through scene. The TV mini series ''[[The Winds of War]]'', ''[[The Bill]]'' and the BBC shows ''[[Waking the Dead (TV series)|Waking the Dead]]'', ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' have all used Northolt to represent various fictional airfields.<ref name="Bristow"/> In early 2010 the station was used for the filming of the BBC's final series of ''[[Ashes to Ashes (TV series)|Ashes to Ashes]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwcp.co.uk/news/news/the-iw-might-be-but-its-car-is-a-star-in-finale-32929.aspx |title=The IW might be **** but its car is a star in finale |author=Martin Neville |date=21 May 2010 |work= |publisher=Isle of Wight County Press |accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref>
