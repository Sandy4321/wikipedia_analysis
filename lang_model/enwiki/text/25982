'''''The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle''''' is the second [[album]] by [[Bruce Springsteen]] and the as-yet-unnamed [[E Street Band]], and is described by [[Allmusic]] as "one of the greatest albums in the history of [[rock & roll]]."<ref name=Allmusic/> It was released in [[1973 in music|1973]]. The album includes the song "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)," the band's most-used set-closing song for the first 10 years of its career.

As with Springsteen's first album, it was well-received critically but had little commercial success at the time. However, once Springsteen achieved popularity with ''[[Born to Run]]'', several selections from this album became popular [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] airplay and concert favorites.

In 2003, the album was ranked number 132 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref name=RS500>{{cite book |chapter=132 &#124; The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle - Bruce Springsteen |chapterurl=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/the-wild-the-innocent-and-the-e-street-shuffle-bruce-springsteen-19691231 |accessdate={{date|2006-04-14}} |last=Levy |first=Joe |coauthors=Steven Van Zandt |title=[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]] |origyear=2005 |edition=3rd |year=2006 |publisher=Turnaround |location=London |isbn=1-932958-61-4 |oclc=70672814 |ref=RS500}}</ref>  On November 7, 2009, Springsteen and the E Street Band played the album in its entirety for the first time ever in a concert at [[Madison Square Garden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2009/11/bruce_springsteen_to_perform_e.html|publisher=nj.com|title=Bruce Springsteen to perform entire albums at Madison Square Garden shows|3 November 2009|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref>

==Background==
The E Street Band is known to have taken its name from [[David Sancious]]' s home in [[Belmar, New Jersey]].<ref name=insidejersey>{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/insidejersey/index.ssf/2009/05/bruce_rocked_here.html|publisher=nj.com|title=Bruce Springsteen Rocked Here|last=Goldstein|first=Stan|date=15 May 2009|accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref> But based on first-hand recounts of Sancious, the 'shuffle' occurred when the band's rented truck broke down late one night after a gig in New York City. Snowing, but within walking distance of Sancious' mother's home, the band decided to walk the short distance. The back photo on the album has the six band members standing in a doorway.<ref name=Goldmine>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldminemag.com/tag/david-sancious|title=E Street should lead directly to the Rock Hall of Fame|publisher=''[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]''|date=19 May 2011|accessdate=15 April 2012}}</ref>.  The picture was of an antique store on Sairs Ave in the west end section of Long Branch, New Jersey. The building was across the street from West End Elementary School, and for years was Tommy Reeds bicycle repair shop and penny candy store; it has since been demolished and its former location is occupied by a parking lot.
