==Story and plot details==

Somewhere in Limbo . . . . . . . . . 

Two huge wooden doors slowly creak open and light seeps into a huge inner sanctum. Two figures; one dressed in black the other white, cross the engraved marble floor and move towards the center of this vast domed room. They stand either side of a large glass globe that sits in an ornate gold cradle, trapped within it a swirling black smoke weaves and bobs around as if it has a life of its own. 

FATE - "Yet again the hour is upon us, how quickly our cousin Time wields his mighty sword" 

DESTINY - "Yes indeed, but on this occasion my dear brother, you shall not be victorious." 

FATE - "I fear no creature and covet no mortal trait. I was born to rule and rule I shall." 

DESTINY - "We shall see. Is everything set? The Book...........where is the Book?" 

FATE - "Sufferance is where Mankind's curiosity will find it." 

DESTINY - "Then for the 7th and final time...........Let battle commence!" 

FATE - "And for the last time I look forward to your failures. Let it begin!" 

DESTINY - "Behold Brother!.............. It already has.............." 

The two adversaries look closer into the glass orb. The dark swirling smoke begins to clear to reveal a sailing ship at full sail gliding through the water. Displayed on the ships nameplate are the words - 'Mary Celeste'
