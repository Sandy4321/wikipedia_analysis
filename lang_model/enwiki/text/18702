"'''Video Phone'''" is a song by American [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles|Beyonc<U+00E9>]] from her third studio album, ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008). The track was released as the eighth and final [[single (music)|single]] from the album. A remixed version, featuring pop singer [[Lady Gaga]] was released later, and was included on the deluxe edition of the album. Musically, the song consists of simple lyrics and hidden innuendos, with Gaga and Beyonc<U+00E9> trading verses with each other, in the remix. The lyrics refer to putting up a show on camera.

The song received generally mixed reviews from most of the critics, who noted that Gaga's featured appearance failed to add anything to the tune. The original version charted in the lower regions of the charts of Australia and its Urban chart, Spain, United Kingdom and on the US R&B charts. The remixed version charted at sixty-five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It also charted in Australia and its Urban chart, the Czech Republic, New Zealand, while it the main charts of Belgium.

A music video was created to accompany the song featuring Gaga. It portrayed her and Beyonce in a number of costumes, brandishing colorful guns towards men and paying homage to the film ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' and pinup legend [[Bettie Page]]. It received mixed feedback from critics who called it un-interesting, [[misandric]] and felt that it did not present anything new. However, they complimented the costumes and the cinematic homage of the video.

During Gaga's verse, she and Knowles appear wearing white leotards; they both sing to the camera while shooting more toy guns in open fire. Knowles next brandishes a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] and fires arrows at a cameraman who strapped to a rotating dart board. She and Gaga, now in front of a white backdrop, perform a synchronized dance together, with Gaga wearing a pair of yellow [[Christian Louboutin|Louboutins]] heels.<ref name="daily"/> Knowles then appears dressed as an homage to [[Bettie Page]], while handling several different [[firearm]]s.<ref name="mtvvid"/><ref name="nyd"/> Throughout the video, the two singers fire their guns and arrows at men. The video ends with Knowles shooting a gun while perched upon a stationary motorcycle and surrounded by images from the start of the video.<ref name="mtvvid"/>

James Montogomery from MTV commented that "it's a little surprising that the just-released clip for Beyonc<U+00E9>'s "Video Phone" has nary a flame or fish-eye shot (there are, of course, plenty of outlandish costumes). However, don't make the mistake of thinking this video is by any means straightforward&nbsp;<U+2014> it's plenty WTF!
