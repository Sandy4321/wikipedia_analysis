'''Gloria Marie Steinem''' (born March 25, 1934) is an American [[Feminism|feminist]], journalist, and social and political activist who became nationally recognized as a leader of, and spokeswoman for, the [[Second-wave feminism|feminist movement]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name=cnn/><ref name=history/><ref name=encyclopedia/>

She was a columnist for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine and a founder of ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine.<ref name=encyclopedia/> In 1969, she published an article, "After Black Power, Women's Liberation",<ref>{{cite web|last=Steinem |first=Gloria |url=http://jwa.org/feminism/_html/_pdf/JWA067a.pdf |title=Gloria Steinem, Feminist Pioneer, Leader for Women's Rights and Equality|work=New York Magazine |date=April 7, 1969 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref> which brought her to national fame as a feminist leader.<ref name=connecticutforum>{{cite web|url=https://www.ctforum.org/panelist/gloria-steinem|title=After Black Power, Women's Liberation |work=The Connecticut Forum|date= |accessdate=November 9, 2014}}</ref> 

In 2005, Steinem, [[Jane Fonda]], and [[Robin Morgan]] co-founded the [[Women's Media Center]], an organization that works "to make women visible and powerful in the media."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.feminist.com/activism/wmc36.html|title=The Invisible Majority <U+2013> Women & the Media|work=Feminist.com|date= |accessdate=November 9, 2014}}</ref> 

Steinem currently travels internationally as an organizer and lecturer and is a media spokeswoman on issues of equality.<ref name="Gloriasteinem.com"/> She is also working on ''Road to the Heart: America As if Everyone Mattered'', a book about her work as a feminist organizer.<ref name="Gloriasteinem.com"/>

==Early life==
Steinem was born in [[Toledo, Ohio]], on March 25, 1934.<ref name=history/> Her mother, Ruth (''n<U+00E9>e'' Nuneviller), was a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] of Scottish and German descent, and her father, Leo Steinem, was the son of [[Jewish]] immigrants from Germany and Poland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/feminism/_html/JWA067.htm |title=Gloria Steinem |publisher=Jewish Women's Archive|date= |accessdate=November 8, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/steinem.html |title=Ancestry of Gloria Steinem |publisher=Wargs.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref> The Steinems lived and traveled about in the trailer from which Leo carried out his trade as a traveling antiques dealer.<ref>{{cite web|first=Letty Cottin |last=Pogrebin|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/steinem-gloria |title=Gloria Steinem |publisher=Jewish Women's Archive |date=March 20, 2009 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref>

Before Steinem was born, her mother Ruth, then aged 34, had a "nervous breakdown" that left her an invalid, trapped in delusional fantasies that occasionally turned violent.<ref name="Steinem 1983 140<U+2013>142">{{cite book|last=Steinem|first=Gloria|title=Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|year=1983|isbn=978-0-03-063236-5|pages=140<U+2013>142}}</ref> She changed "from an energetic, fun-loving, book-loving" woman into "someone who was afraid to be alone, who could not hang on to reality long enough to hold a job, and who could rarely concentrate enough to read a book."<ref name="Steinem 1983 140<U+2013>142"/> Ruth spent long periods in and out of sanatoriums for the mentally ill.<ref name="Steinem 1983 140<U+2013>142"/> Steinem was ten years old when her parents finally separated in 1944.<ref name="Steinem 1983 140<U+2013>142"/> Her father went to California to find work, while she and her mother continued to live together in Toledo.<ref name="Steinem 1983 140<U+2013>142"/>

While her parents divorced as a result of her mother's illness, it was not a result of chauvinism on the father's part, and Steinem claims to have "understood and never blamed him for the breakup."<ref>Marcello, Patricia. ''Gloria Steinem: A Biography.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004. p. 20.</ref> Nevertheless, the impact of these events had a formative effect on her personality: while her father, a traveling salesman, had never provided much financial stability to the family, his exit aggravated their situation.<ref name="Marcello, Patricia 2004">Marcello, Patricia. ''Gloria Steinem: A Biography.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004.</ref> Steinem interpreted her mother's inability to hold on to a job as evidence of general hostility towards working women.<ref name="Marcello, Patricia 2004"/> She also interpreted the general apathy of doctors towards her mother as emerging from a similar anti-woman animus.<ref name="Marcello, Patricia 2004"/> Years later, Steinem described her mother's experiences as having been pivotal to her understanding of social injustices.<ref name="OutrageousActs">{{Cite book

But I must say, I never felt that. I used to sit and try and figure out how old the child would be, trying to make myself feel guilty. But I never could! I think the person who said: 'Honey, if men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament' was right. Speaking for myself, I knew it was the first time I had taken responsibility for my own life. I wasn't going to let things happen to me. I was going to direct my life, and therefore it felt positive. But still, I didn't tell anyone. Because I knew that out there it wasn't [positive]."<ref name="guardian1"/> She also said, "In later years, if I'm remembered at all it will be for inventing a phrase like 'reproductive freedom' . . . as a phrase it includes the freedom to have children or not to. So it makes it possible for us to make a coalition."<ref>Gilbert, Lynn & Moore, Gaylen, "Particular Passions: Talks With Women Who Shaped Our Times<U+201D>. Clarkson Potter, 1981. p. 166</ref>

In 1993 Steinem co-produced and narrated an Emmy Award winning TV documentary for HBO about child abuse, called, "Multiple Personalities: The Search for Deadly Memories."<ref name="Gloriasteinem.com"/> Also in 1993, she and Rosilyn Heller co-produced an original TV movie for Lifetime, "Better Off Dead," which examined the parallel forces that both oppose abortion and support the death penalty.<ref name="Gloriasteinem.com"/>

On June 1, 2013 Steinem performed on stage at the "Chime For Change: The Sound Of Change Live" Concert at Twickenham Stadium in London, England.<ref name="zimbio.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/pictures/4EbMPEQyb-n/Show+Chime+Change+Sound+Change+Live+Concert/cQug0JKo9cj/Gloria+Steinem |title=Gloria Steinem Pictures <U+2013> Show At "Chime For Change: The Sound Of Change Live" Concert |publisher=Zimbio |date=May 31, 2013 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}</ref> Chime For Change is a global campaign for girls' and women's empowerment founded by Gucci.<ref name="zimbio.com"/>

In 2014 [[UN Women]] began its commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]], and as part of that campaign Steinem (and others) spoke at the [[Apollo Theater]] in New York City.<ref name="beijing">{{cite web|url=https://www.looktothestars.org/news/12227-gloria-steinem-helps-un-women-unveil-beijing-20-campaign |title=Gloria Steinem Helps UN Women Unveil Beijing+20 Campaign|publisher=Zimbio |date=July 1, 2014|accessdate=November 11, 2014}}</ref> Chime For Change is a global campaign for girls' and women's empowerment founded by Gucci.<ref name="zimbio.com"/>

Steinem has stated, "I think the fact that I've become a symbol for the women's movement is somewhat accidental. A woman member of Congress, for example, might be identified as a member of Congress; it doesn't mean she's any less of a feminist but she's identified by her nearest male analog. Well, I don't have a male analog so the press has to identify me with the movement. I suppose I could be referred to as a journalist, but because Ms. is part of a movement and not just a typical magazine, I'm more likely to be identified with the movement. There's no other slot to put me in."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gilbert |first=Lynn |title=Particular Passions: Gloria Steinem |url= http://particularpassions.com/Excerpts.htm |series=Women of Wisdom Series |edition=1st |date=December 10, 2012 |publisher=Lynn Gilbert Inc. |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-1-61979-354-5|accessdate=November 11, 2014}}</ref>

Contrary to popular belief, Steinem did not coin the feminist slogan "A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle." Although she helped popularize it, the phrase is actually attributable to [[Irina Dunn]].<ref>{{cite web

</ref> When ''Time'' magazine published an article attributing the saying to Steinem, Steinem wrote a letter saying the phrase had been coined by Dunn.<ref>Letters, ''Time'' magazine, US edition, September 16, 2000 and Australian edition, October 9, 2000. Retrieved November 11, 2014</ref>

Another phrase sometimes wrongly attributed to Steinem is, "If men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament." Steinem herself attributed it to "an old Irish woman taxi driver in Boston," who she said she and [[Florynce Kennedy]] met.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bardi|first=Jennifer|url=http://thehumanist.org/september-october-2012/the-humanist-interview-with-gloria-steinem/ |title=The Humanist Interview with Gloria Steinem |publisher=Thehumanist.org |date=14 August 2012 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}</ref>

==Involvement in political campaigns==
Steinem's involvement in presidential campaigns stretches back to her support of [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952 presidential campaign]].<ref>Lazo, Caroine. ''Gloria Steinem: Feminist Extraordinaire.'' New York: Lerner Publications, 1998. pp. 28.</ref>

===1968 election===
A proponent of civil rights and fierce [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|critic of the Vietnam War]], Steinem was initially drawn to Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] because of his "admirable record" on those issues, but in meeting him and hearing him speak, she found him "cautious, uninspired, and dry."<ref name="OutrageousActs"/>{{rp|87}} As the campaign progressed, Steinem became baffled at "personally vicious" attacks that McCarthy leveled against his primary opponent [[Robert Kennedy]], even as "his real opponent, [[Hubert Humphrey]], went free."<ref name="OutrageousActs"/>{{rp|88}}

On a late-night radio show, Steinem garnered attention for declaring, "[[George McGovern]] is the real Eugene McCarthy."<ref>Miroff, Bruce. ''The Liberals' Moment: The McGovern Insurgency and the Identity Crisis of the Democratic Party''. University Press of Kansas, 2007. pp. 206</ref> In 1968, Steinem was chosen to pitch the arguments to McGovern as to why he should enter the presidential race that year; he agreed, and Steinem "consecutively or simultaneously served as pamphlet writer, advance "man", fund raiser, lobbyist of delegates, errand runner, and press secretary."<ref name="OutrageousActs"/>{{rp|95}}

McGovern lost the nomination at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, and Steinem later wrote of her astonishment at [[Hubert Humphrey]]'s "refusal even to suggest to [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago Mayor]] [[Richard J. Daley]] that he control the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|rampaging police]] and the bloodshed in the streets."<ref name="OutrageousActs"/>{{rp|96}}

===1972 election===
Steinem was reluctant to re-join the McGovern campaign, as although she had brought in McGovern's single largest campaign contributor in 1968, she "''still'' had been treated like a frivolous pariah by much of McGovern's campaign staff." In April 1972, Steinem remarked that he "still doesn't understand the Women's Movement."<ref name="OutrageousActs"/>{{rp|114}}

McGovern ultimately excised the abortion issue from the party's platform, and recent publications show McGovern was deeply conflicted on the issue.<ref>Miroff. p. 207.</ref> Steinem later wrote this description of the events:
{{quote|The consensus of the meeting of women delegates held by the caucus had been to fight for the minority plank on reproductive freedom; indeed our vote had supported the plank nine to one.  So fight we did, with three women delegates speaking eloquently in its favor as a constitutional right. One male Right-to-Life zealot spoke against, and Shirley MacLaine also was an opposition speaker, on the grounds that this ''was'' a fundamental right but didn't belong in the platform. We made a good showing.  Clearly we would have won if McGovern's forces had left their delegates uninstructed and thus able to vote their consciences.<ref name="OutrageousActs"/>{{rp|100<U+2013>110}}}}

However, [[Germaine Greer]] flatly contradicted Steinem's account, reporting, "Jacqui Ceballos called from the crowd to demand abortion rights on the Democratic platform, but Bella [Abzug] and Gloria stared glassily out into the room," thus killing the abortion rights platform," and asking "Why had Bella and Gloria not helped Jacqui to nail him on abortion? What reticence, what loserism had afflicted them?"<ref name="Greer_Harpers">Harper's Magazine October 1972.</ref> Steinem later recalled that the 1972 Convention was the only time Greer and Steinem ever met.<ref>{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Joni|url=http://www.wowowow.com/point-of-view/gloria-steinem-still-committing-outrageous-acts-at-75/ |title="Gloria Steinem: Still Committing 'Outrageous Acts' at 75"|publisher=Wow|date=April 16, 2009|accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref>

The cover of Harper's that month read, "Womanlike, they did not want to get tough with their man, and so, womanlike, they got screwed."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://harpers.org/archive/1972 |title=Harper's Magazine Archives |publisher=Harpers.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref>

===2004 election===
In the run-up to the 2004 election, Steinem voiced fierce criticism of the Bush administration, asserting, "There has never been an administration that has been more hostile to women's equality, to reproductive freedom as a fundamental human right, and has acted on that hostility," adding, "If he is elected in 2004, abortion will be criminalized in this country."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzflash.com/interviews/04/02/int04008.html |title=Buzzflash Interview |publisher=Buzzflash.com |date=February 5, 2004 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref> At a [[Planned Parenthood]] event in [[Boston]], Steinem declared Bush "a danger to health and safety," citing his antagonism to the [[Clean Water Act]], reproductive freedom, sex education, and AIDS relief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2004/7/26/feminist_pioneer_gloria_steinem_bush_is |title=Feminist Pioneer Gloria Steinem: "Bush is a Danger to Our Health and Safety" |publisher=Democracynow.org |date=July 26, 2004 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref>

===2008 election===
[[File:Gloria Steinem 2008.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Steinem at Brighton High School, Brighton, Colorado, in November 2008]]
Steinem was an active participant in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]], and praised both the Democratic front-runners, commenting,
{{quote|text=Both Senators Clinton and Obama are [[civil rights]] advocates, [[feminists]], [[environmentalists]], and critics of the [[war in Iraq]].... Both have resisted pandering to the right, something that sets them apart from any [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate, including [[John McCain]]. Both have Washington and foreign policy experience; [[George W.

Nevertheless, Steinem endorsed Senator [[Hillary Clinton]], citing her broader experience, and saying that the nation was in such bad shape it might require two terms of Clinton and two of Obama to fix it.<ref>{{cite web

She also made headlines for a ''[[New York Times]]'' op-ed in which she cited [[gender]] and not [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] as "probably the most restricting force in American life".<ref name=opinion>{{cite news|last=Steinem|first=Gloria|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/opinion/08steinem.html?_r=1/|title=Women Are Never Front-Runners |publisher=New York Times|date= January 8, 2008|accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref>  She elaborated, "Black men were given the vote a half-century before women of any race were allowed to mark a ballot, and generally have ascended to positions of power, from the military to the boardroom, before any women."<ref name=opinion/> This was attacked, however, from critics saying that white women were given the vote unabridged in 1920, whereas many blacks, female or male, could not vote until the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], and some were lynched for trying, and that many white women advanced in the business and political worlds before black women and men.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40811 |publisher=Inter Press News |accessdate=March 16, 2011 |date=January 16, 2008 |first=Ali |last=Gharib |title=Democratic Race Sheds Issues for Identities}}</ref>

Steinem again drew attention for, according to the ''[[New York Observer]]'', seeming "to denigrate the importance of [[John McCain]]'s time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam"; Steinem's broader argument "was that the media and the political world are too admiring of militarism in all its guises."<ref>{{cite web|last=Stanage|first=Niall|url=http://observer.com/2008/03/stumping-for-clinton-steinem-says-mccains-pow-cred-is-overrated/|title=Stumping for Clinton, Steinem Says McCain's POW Cred Is Overrated|publisher=New York Observer|date= March 8, 2008|accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref>

Following McCain's selection of [[Sarah Palin]] as his running mate, Steinem penned an op-ed in which she labeled Palin an "unqualified woman" who "opposes everything most other women want and need," described her nomination speech as "divisive and deceptive", called for a more inclusive Republican Party, and concluded that Palin resembled "[[Phyllis Schlafly]], only younger."<ref>{{cite web

==CIA Ties==
In May 1975, [[Redstockings]], a [[radical feminism|radical feminist]] group, raised the question of whether Steinem had continuing ties with the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) and whether she had been "meteorically installed" as the leader of the movement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.namebase.org/steinem.html |title=Gloria Steinem and the CIA |author= |date=February 21, 1967  |work=[[NameBase]] |publisher=The New York Times |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/64k9908KK |archivedate=January 16, 2012 |accessdate=2012-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.namebase.org/foia/festival.html |title=Gloria Steinem Spies on Students for the CIA |author= |date=1975 |work=[[NameBase]] |publisher=Redstockings|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/64k6o2GvT |archivedate=January 16, 2012 |accessdate=2012-01-20}}</ref> Though she admitted to having worked for a CIA-financed foundation in the late 1950s and early 1960s (Independent Research Service), and acknowledged these ties in interviews given to the ''New York Times'' and ''Washington Post'' in 1967 in the wake of the ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine CIA exposures (nearly two years before Steinem attended her first Redstockings or feminist meeting), Steinem in 1975 denied any continuing involvement.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harrington|first=Stephanie|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1976/07/04/books/friedan-changed.html/|title="It Changed My Life"|publisher=The New York Times|date=July 4, 1976|accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref>

On September 3, 2000, at age 66, Steinem married [[David Bale]], father of actor [[Christian Bale]].<ref name="BiographyCom"/> The wedding was performed at the home of her friend [[Wilma Mankiller]], the first female [[Principal Chiefs of the Cherokee|Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Feminist icon Gloria Steinem first-time bride at 66|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/09/05/steinem.marriage.ap/index.html|publisher=CNN.com|date=September 5, 2000|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070917071020/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/09/05/steinem.marriage.ap/index.html|archivedate=September 17, 2007|accessdate=November 16, 2014}}</ref> Steinem and Bale were married for only three years before he died of brain [[lymphoma]] on December 30, 2003, at age 62.<ref>{{cite news| last = von Zeilbauer| first = Paul| title = David Bale, 62, Activist and businessman| publisher = The New York Times| date = January 1, 2004| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/01/us/david-bale-62-activist-and-businessman.html|accessdate=November 16, 2014}}</ref>

==Feminist positions==
Although most frequently considered a [[liberal feminist]], Steinem has repeatedly characterized herself as a [[radical feminist]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.feminist.com/resources/artspeech/interviews/gloria.htm/ |title=Marianne Schnall Interview |publisher=Feminist.com |date=April 3, 1995 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref> More importantly, she has repudiated categorization within feminism as "nonconstructive to specific problems", saying: "I've turned up in every category. So it makes it harder for me to take the divisions with great seriousness."<ref name="Gorney"/> Nevertheless, on concrete issues, Steinem has staked firm positions, as shown below:

===Abortion===
Steinem is [[pro-choice]].<ref name="nymag1"/><ref name="nymag2"/> She had an abortion herself in London at the age of 22.<ref name="guardian1"/> In 1969 she covered an abortion speak-out for ''[[New York Magazine]]'', which was held in a church basement in [[Greenwich Village|Greenwich, New York]].<ref name="nymag1"/><ref name="nymag2"/> She felt what she called a "big click" at the speak-out, and later said she didn't "begin my life as an active feminist" until that day.<ref name="nymag2"/> As she recalled,
<blockquote>It [abortion] is supposed to make us a bad person. But I must say, I never felt that. I used to sit and try and figure out how old the child would be, trying to make myself feel guilty. But I never could! I think the person who said: 'Honey, if men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament' was right. Speaking for myself, I knew it was the first time I had taken responsibility for my own life. I wasn't going to let things happen to me. I was going to direct my life, and therefore it felt positive. But still, I didn't tell anyone. Because I knew that out there it wasn't [positive].<ref name="guardian1"/></blockquote>

She credited the ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]]'' hearings she covered<ref>

===Female genital mutilation and male circumcision===
In 1979, Steinem wrote the article on [[female genital mutilation]] that brought it into the American public's consciousness; the article was called "The International Crime of Female Genital Mutilation," and was published in the March 1979 issue of [[Ms. (magazine)|Ms. magazine]].<ref name="OutrageousActs"/>{{rp|292}}<ref name =crime>"The International Crime of Female Genital Mutilation," by Gloria Steinem. ''Ms.'', March 1979, p. 65.</ref> The article reported on the "75 million women suffering with the results of genital mutilation."<ref name="OutrageousActs"/>{{rp|292}}<ref name=crime/> According to Steinem, "The real reasons for genital mutilation can only be understood in the context of the [[patriarchy]]: men must control women's bodies as the means of production, and thus repress the independent power of women's sexuality."<ref name="OutrageousActs"/>{{rp|292}}<ref name=crime/> Steinem's article contains the basic arguments that would later be developed by philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]].<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Sex & Social Justice.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. pp. 118<U+2013>129.</ref>

On male [[circumcision]], she commented, "These patriarchal controls limit men's sexuality too... That's why men are asked symbolically to submit the sexual part of themselves and their sons to patriarchal authority, which seems to be the origin of male circumcision, a practice that, even as advocates admit, is medically unnecessary 90% of the time. Speaking for myself, I stand with many brothers in eliminating that practice too."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noharmm.org/FGCsay.htm |title=What have FGC opponents said publicly about male genital cutting? |publisher=Noharmm.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref>

===Feminist theory===
Steinem has repeatedly voiced her disapproval of the [[obscurantism]] and abstractions some claim to be prevalent in [[feminist theory|feminist academic theorizing]].<ref name="Gorney"/><ref name="Denes">{{cite news

}}</ref> She said, "Nobody cares about feminist academic writing. That's careerism. These poor women in academia have to talk this silly language that nobody can understand in order to be accepted...But I recognize the fact that we have this ridiculous system of tenure, that the whole thrust of academia is one that values education, in my opinion, in inverse ratio to its usefulness<U+2014>and what you write in inverse relationship to its understandability."<ref name="Gorney"/> Steinem later singled out [[deconstruction]]ists like [[Judith Butler]] for criticism, saying, "I always wanted to put a sign up on the road to Yale saying, 'Beware: Deconstruction Ahead'. Academics are forced to write in language no one can understand so that they get tenure. They have to say 'discourse', not 'talk'. Knowledge that is not accessible is not helpful. It becomes aerialised."<ref name="Denes"/>

===Pornography===
Steinem has criticized pornography, which she distinguishes from [[erotica]], writing: "Erotica is as different from pornography as love is from rape, as dignity is from humiliation, as partnership is from slavery, as pleasure is from pain."<ref name="OutrageousActs"/>{{rp|219}}<ref name=Erotica>''Erotica and Pornography: A Clear and Present Difference''.

Both retrieved November 16, 2014.</ref> Steinem's argument hinges on the distinction between reciprocity versus domination, as she writes, "Blatant or subtle, pornography involves no equal power or mutuality. In fact, much of the tension and drama comes from the clear idea that one person is dominating the other."<ref name="OutrageousActs"/>{{rp|219}}<ref name=Erotica/>On the issue of same-sex pornography, Steinem asserts, "Whatever the gender of the participants, all pornography including male-male gay pornography is an imitation of the male-female, conqueror-victim paradigm, and almost all of it actually portrays or implies enslaved women and master."<ref name="OutrageousActs"/>{{rp|219}}<ref name=Erotica/> Steinem has also cited "[[snuff films]]" as a serious threat to women.<ref name="OutrageousActs"/>{{rp|219}}<ref name=Erotica/>

===Same-sex marriage===

In a 2,200-word essay published in ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' magazine on August 31, 1970, "What Would It Be Like If Women Win", Steinem wrote about same-sex marriage in the context of the "Utopian" future she envisioned, writing:

<blockquote>What will exist is a variety of alternative life-styles. Since the population explosion dictates that childbearing be kept to a minimum, parents-and-children will be only one of many "families": couples, age groups, working groups, mixed communes, blood-related clans, class groups, creative groups. Single women will have the right to stay single without ridicule, without the attitudes now betrayed by "spinster" and "bachelor." Lesbians or homosexuals will no longer be denied legally binding marriages, complete with mutual-support agreements and inheritance rights. Paradoxically, the number of homosexuals may get smaller. With fewer over-possessive mothers and fewer fathers who hold up an impossibly cruel or perfectionist idea of manhood,  boys will be less likely to be denied or reject their identity as males.<ref name=WomenWin>{{cite web|title=What Would It Be Like If Women Win|url=http://jackiewhiting.net/AP/Steinem.htm|work=AP|date=August 31, 1970|accessdate=2011-01-17|archiveurl= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,876786,00.html|archivedate=November 16, 2014}}</ref></blockquote>

Although Steinem did not mention or advocate same-sex marriage in any published works or interviews for more than three decades, she again expressed support for [[same-sex marriage]] in the early 2000s, stating in 2004 that "[t]he idea that sexuality is only okay if it ends in reproduction oppresses women<U+2014>whose health depends on separating sexuality from reproduction<U+2014>as well as gay men and lesbians."<ref>{{cite news

In 1977, Steinem expressed disapproval that the heavily publicized sex reassignment surgery of tennis player [[Ren<U+00E9>e Richards]] had been characterized as "a frightening instance of what feminism could lead to" or as "living proof that feminism isn't necessary."<ref name="OutrageousActs"/>{{rp|206<U+2013>210}} Steinem wrote, "At a minimum, it was a diversion from the widespread problems of sexual inequality."<ref name="OutrageousActs"/>{{rp|206<U+2013>210}} She also wrote that, while she supported the right of individuals to identify as they choose, she claimed that, in many cases, transsexuals "surgically mutilate their own bodies" in order to conform to a gender role that is inexorably tied to physical body parts.<ref name="OutrageousActs"/>{{rp|206<U+2013>210}} She concluded that "feminists are right to feel uncomfortable about the need for and uses of transsexualism."<ref name="OutrageousActs"/>{{rp|206<U+2013>210}} The article concluded with what became one of Steinem's most famous quotes: "If the shoe doesn't fit, must we change the foot?"<ref name="OutrageousActs"/>{{rp|206<U+2013>210}} Although clearly meant in the context of transsexuality, the quote is frequently mistaken as a general statement about feminism.<ref name="OutrageousActs"/>{{rp|206<U+2013>210}}

On October 2, 2013, Steinem clarified her remarks on transsexualism in an op-ed for ''[[The Advocate]]'', writing that critics failed to consider that her 1977 essay was "written in the context of global protests against routine surgical assaults, called [[female genital mutilation]] by some survivors."<ref name="Steinem">{{cite web|last=Steinem |first=Gloria |url=http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2013/10/02/op-ed-working-together-over-time |title=Op-ed: On Working Together Over Time |publisher=Advocate.com |date=October 2, 2013 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}</ref> Steinem later in the piece expressed unequivocal support for transgender people, saying that transgender people "including those who have transitioned, are living out real, authentic lives. Those lives should be celebrated, not questioned."<ref name="Steinem"/> She also apologized for any pain her words might have caused.<ref name="Steinem"/>
