'''''Manhunter''''' is a 1986 [[Thriller (genre)|thriller film]] based on [[Thomas Harris]]'s novel ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]''. Written and directed by [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]], it features [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Hannibal Lecktor ([[Hannibal Lecter]] in later films) and stars [[William Petersen]], [[Joan Allen]], [[Kim Greist]], [[Dennis Farina]], and [[Tom Noonan]]. The [[Cinematography|cinematographer]] was [[Dante Spinotti]], who also served as the director of photography on ''[[Red Dragon (film)|Red Dragon]]'', the 2002 film version of the novel.

==Plot==
[[Will Graham]] (Peterson), a former criminal profiler who retired due to a breakdown caused by his last case, concerning [[Canibalism|cannibal]] [[serial killer]] [[Hannibal Lecter|Dr. Hannibal Lecktor]], is seated on the beach with his former boss [[Jack Crawford (character)|Jack Crawford]] (Farina). Crawford is working a new serial murder case, and asks Graham to aid the investigation. Graham reluctantly agrees, and visits the most recent crime scene, attempting to enter the mindset of the killer, now dubbed "[[Francis Dollarhyde|The Tooth Fairy]]" by the police. 

Elswhere, the forensic team have extracted an unknown fingerprint from one of the bodies, after Graham's insight revealed that the killer opened the corpses' eyes with his bare hands. Leaving an Atlanta police department, Graham and Crawford are accosted by tabloid journalist Freddie Lounds (Lang), with whom Graham has a bitter history. From here, Graham pays Lecktor (Cox) a visit, and asks Lecktor for his insight into the killer's motivations. After trading wits, Lecktor agrees to look at the case file. Graham, still affected by their past dealings, calms himself outside the prison building, where Lounds photographs him from a parked car. Meanwhile, in his cell, Lecktor is able to [[Phreaking|manipulate]] his prison telephone to place an outside call, deceitfully obtaining Graham's home address. 

Graham travels to the first crime scene, again placing himself in the Tooth Fairy's shoes, realizing the depth of the killer's voyeurism. Shortly thereafter, he is contacted by Crawford, who tells him of Lounds' tabloid story on the case. Crawford also patches Graham through to [[Frederick Chilton]] ([[Benjamin Hendrickson]]), Lecktor's warden, who has found a note in Lecktor's personal effects. Reading it, they realize it's from the Tooth Fairy, expressing admiration for Lecktor <U+2013> and an interest in Graham. 

Crawford brings Graham back to [[Quantico]], where a missing section of the note is analyzed to determine what Lecktor has removed <U+2013> finding an instruction to communicate through the personals section of the National Tattler, Lounds' newspaper. The FBI sets up a fake personal ad to replace Lecktor's response with. Before replacing the ad, they discover that the exchanges are coded <U+2013> meaning the new message would be an obvious fake. Graham insists they run the ad anyway, figuring that if they do spook the Tooth Fairy, they can still bait him in the future using Graham himself as a target. To this end, Graham organizes an interview with Lounds, where he sets forth a false profile of the Tooth Fairy in order to incite him, declaring him to be a homosexual sadist who molests his male victims. They also include a press photo staged with a deliberately identifiable location. After this, Graham is given a bullet-proof vest to protect himself. 

Later, Lounds is approaching his car when he is kidnapped by the Tooth Fairy (Noonan). Waking in Dollarhyde's home, he is shown a slideshow of [[William Blake]]'s [[The Great Red Dragon Paintings|Great Red Dragon paintings]], along with his past victims and slides of a family the killer identifies as his next targets. Lounds is forced to tape-record a statement, before being set alight in his chair. Graham is then told by Crawford that they have cracked Lecktor's coded message to the Tooth Fairy <U+2013> it's Graham's home address, with an instruction to "kill them all". A police officer checks in on Graham's family, and the mood is tense when he arrives home. Graham tries to explain the details of his past breakdown to his son. 

At his job in a photography lab, Francis Dollarhyde <U+2013> the Tooth Fairy <U+2013> awkwardly approaches his blind co-worker Reba McClane ([[Joan Allen]]). The pair return to Dollarhyde's home, where he watches film footage of his planned next victim with the oblivious Reba. She kisses him, and they make love. Dollarhyde is confused by this newfound relationship, though it helps him suppress his bloodlust. However, just as Graham comes to realize how much Dollarhyde's desire for acceptance factors into the murders, Dollarhyde watches as Reba is escorted home by another co-worker, mistakenly believing them to be kissing on the doorstep. Enraged, Dollarhyde murders the man, and abducts Reba, claiming that "Francis is gone. Forever."

Reviewing his progress, an increasingly frazzled Graham realizes that the Tooth Fairy has been casing the victims' homes through home videos, enabling him to prepare for the break-ins in extreme detail. At Dollarhyde's home, Reba is left terrified as he contemplates what to do with her. On a private flight, Graham and Crawford sort through a list of video and photography lab employees, checking for a match to their profile <U+2013> soon turning up Dollarhyde. With his name and address on hand, Graham and Crawford hurry to his home.

Dollarhyde struggles to kill Reba with a piece of broken mirror glass, as police teams assemble around the house. Seeing that Dollarhyde has someone in the house with him, Graham lunges through the house's large window, but is quickly subdued by the imposing Dollarhyde, who retrieves a shotgun and kills several of police officers around the house with it. He returns to shoot Graham, but misses, and is killed in return. Graham and Reba are tended to by paramedics, before Graham returns home to a warm welcome from his wife and son, who have come to terms with his career.

==Production==
The film was originally going to use the novel's title, ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]''. When ''[[Year of the Dragon (film)|Year of the Dragon]]'' [[Box office bomb|bombed]] at the box office in 1985, producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] decided to change the title.<ref name="Total Film">{{Cite journal|last=Mottram |first=James |author=James Mottram |year=2011 |month=March |title=Manhunter |journal=[[Total Film]] |issue=177 |pages=112<U+2013>116 |location=London |publisher=Future Publishing |editor1-first=Day |editor1-last=Aubrey}}</ref> William Petersen has commented that the title was also changed to avoid being confused for a karate movie.<ref name="Inside">''Inside Manhunter: Interviews with Stars William Petersen, Brian Cox, Joan Allen and Tom Noonan''. Behind-the-Scenes Featurette located on the ''Manhunter'' Anchor Bay 2000 DVD Bonus Features.</ref>

In preparation for his role, Petersen worked with the [[Chicago Police Department]] Violent Crimes Unit and the [[FBI]] Violent Crimes Unit to talk to the officers and read some of their crime files. Petersen has stated that director Mann wanted to create a visual aura to bring the audience into the film, so the story would work on an interior and emotional level.<ref name=LAF>Simmons, Sue (interviewer); Petersen, William (actor). (August 15, 1986). ''Live at Five: Interview with William Petersen''. [Television Production]. NBC.</ref>

[[John Lithgow]], [[Mandy Patinkin]], and [[Brian Dennehy]] were all considered for the role of [[Hannibal Lecter]] (spelled "Lecktor" in the film) before Cox was cast. Cox based his portrayal on Scottish [[serial killer]] [[Peter Manuel]], whom he stated "didn't have a sense of right and wrong."<ref name="Inside"/>

During principal photography, [[Tom Noonan]] asked that no one in the cast be allowed to see him. The first time Noonan met [[William Petersen]] was when they filmed the climactic fight scene.<ref name="Inside"/><ref>[[Michael Mann (director)|Mann, Michael]] (writer/director). (2007).

[[Frankie Faison]], who appears as Lt. Fisk, is the only actor to appear in the first four Hannibal films. Faison later had a significant role as Barney, the orderly, in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991), ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001), and ''[[Red Dragon (film)|Red Dragon]]'' (2002).

After principal photography wrapped, [[William Petersen]] had difficulty ridding himself of the [[Will Graham]] character. While rehearsing for a play in Chicago, his new role was "always coming out". To try and rid himself of the character, Petersen went to a barbershop and had them shave his beard, cut his hair and dye it blond, so that when he looked into a mirror, he saw a different person.<ref name="Inside"/> [[Dennis Farina]], [[Bill Smitrovich]], and [[Stephen Lang (actor)|Stephen Lang]] were all later cast in [[Michael Mann (film director)|Michael Mann]]'s TV series ''[[Crime Story (TV series)|Crime Story]]''. The series also featured [[Ted Levine]], who played serial killer [[Buffalo Bill (The Silence of the Lambs)|Buffalo Bill]] in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', an adaption of a later [[Thomas Harris]] novel. Levine and Noonan later worked with Mann again in the 1995 crime thriller ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'', whilst Lang would work with Mann again in ''[[Public Enemies (2009 film)|Public Enemies]]''

The soundtrack album was released in limited quantities in 1986 on MCA Records (#6182), but the film's failure at the box office prevented a release on the then-new compact disc format. Soon afterwards, the 12" record and audio cassette were deleted making them highly sought after by fans of the film. Currently, the film is a cult classic and can be viewed almost daily on various cable channels all over the world, while the soundtrack has become a huge collector's item.

[[File:Manhunter.jpg|thumb|140px|right|[[Anchor Bay Entertainment|Anchor Bay]] Divimax DVD release.]]
''Manhunter'' has been available in various versions on DVD. [[Anchor Bay Entertainment|Anchor Bay]] released a Limited Edition 2-DVD set in 2000 that featured an erroneously labeled "Theatrical Cut" (it actually omits some footage from the theatrical version and features some material from the "Director's Cut" and Mann's "Director's Cut" along with some retrospective featurettes). A standard edition (an individual release for the first disc of the 2-disc set) was also released at the same time. In 2003, Anchor Bay released the "Restored Director's Cut" which is very close to the "Director's Cut" on the 2000 disc but omits one scene. It does, however, feature a commentary track by Mann.

In 2004, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] (current holders of ''The Silence of the Lambs'' and ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'') released a [[pan and scan]]ned version of the movie that was the one seen in theaters. Finally, in 2007, MGM released the theatrical cut in widescreen on DVD for the first time as part of "The Hannibal Lecter Collection" alongside ''The Silence of the Lambs'' and ''Hannibal''. It was also released by itself on September 11, 2007.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Manhunter-William-Petersen/dp/B000UGBOT0/ "''Manhunter'' (1986)" - 2007 DVD Release]. Amazon.com.

==Legacy==
After ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (which was never approached by [[Orion Pictures|Orion]] as a sequel to ''Manhunter'' due to said poor box office performance) was released in 1991, it experienced something of a revival on video and later as a [[DVD]] release.

In 2002, another adaptation of the book, titled ''[[Red Dragon (film)|Red Dragon]]'', was released to a generally positive critical reception and successful box office receipts. The remake, ''Red Dragon'', currently has a 68% rating from 183 reviews.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/red_dragon "''Red Dragon''"]. Rotten Tomatoes. Retrieved 2010-10-07.</ref>
