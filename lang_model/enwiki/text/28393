[[Somerset]] is a [[county]] in the southwest of England. It is home to many types of music.

==Folk music==

The county has a well-documented and still vibrant [[folk music]] heritage, as it was studied by one of the earliest British [[musicology|musicologists]], [[Cecil Sharp]], who cut his teeth on the rich vein of folk music tradition in Somerset. Sharp began his career of collecting folk songs in Somerset in 1903 with the editorial help of his friend Rev [[Charles Marson]], vicar of Hambridge. Cycling around the county during holidays, Sharp ultimately collected more than 1,500 songs from Somerset. The folksinging tradition in Somerset centers on solo, a cappella singing and playing<U+2014>at home, at work, and at gatherings, small or large.<ref>Songs of Somerset Folk, Traditional Songs from the Sharp Archives performed by Eddie Upton, Folk South West, 1998. Halsgrove, Tiverton, Devon. Audio CD, ISBN 1-84114-011-2, ISBN 978-1-84114-011-7</ref> Sharp's five volume collection of Somerset folk songs formed the basis for his ''[[English Folk Song: Some Conclusions]]'', a seminal 1907 publication.  Some of Sharp's collections formed the basis for ''Songs of the West'' (with [[Sabine Baring-Gould]]) and ''[[Somerset Rhapsody]]'' by [[Gustav Holst]] and the "March from Somerset" in [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]]' ''[[English Folk Song Suite]]''.

==Classical==

The [[City of Bath Bach Choir]] (CBBC) was founded in October 1946 by Cuthbert Bates, who was also a founding father of the Bath Bach Festival in 1950.  The choir gave its inaugural concert in June 1947 in [[Bath Abbey]], a performance of J. S. Bach's great Mass in B Minor.  Cuthbert Bates, as well as the founder, was also the choir's principal conductor.

[[Somerset chamber choir]] was formed in 1984 by former members of Somerset Youth Choir,<ref>{{cite news|title=25 years for Somerset Chamber Choir|url=http://content.yudu.com/Library/A19lca/SomersetTimes41/resources/14.htm|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=Somerset Times|date=July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Sowden|first=Steve|title=Somerset Chamber Choir to celebrate 25th anniversary|url=http://www.somersetcountygazette.co.uk/archive/2009/04/12/Yeovil+News+%28ye_news_yeovil%29/4281545.Somerset_Chamber_Choir_to_celebrate_25th_anniversary/|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=Somerset County Gazette|date=12 April 2009}}</ref>  and typically gives two concerts annually.
