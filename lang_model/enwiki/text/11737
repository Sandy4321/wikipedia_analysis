'''''X-Men''''' is a [[2000 in film|2000]] [[superhero film]] based on the fictional [[Marvel Comics]] [[X-Men|characters of the same name]]. Directed by [[Bryan Singer]], the film stars [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Ian McKellen]], [[Anna Paquin]], [[Famke Janssen]], [[Bruce Davison]], [[James Marsden]], [[Halle Berry]], [[Rebecca Romijn]], [[Ray Park]] and [[Tyler Mane]]. It introduces [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] into the conflict between [[Professor X]]avier's X-Men and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], led by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. Magneto intends to mutate world leaders at a [[United Nations]] summit with a machine he has built to bring about acceptance of mutantkind, but Xavier realizes this forced mutation will only result in their deaths.

Development for ''X-Men'' began as far back as 1989 with [[James Cameron]] and [[Carolco Pictures]]. The [[film rights]] went to [[20th Century Fox]] in 1994. Scripts and [[film treatment]]s were commissioned from [[Andrew Kevin Walker]], [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]], [[Joss Whedon]] and [[Michael Chabon]]. Singer signed to direct in 1996, with further rewrites by [[Ed Solomon]], Singer, [[Tom DeSanto]], [[Christopher McQuarrie]] and [[David Hayter]]. [[Start date]]s kept getting pushed back, while Fox decided to move ''X-Men'''s release date from December to July 2000. Filming took place from September 22, 1999 to March 3, 2000, primarily in [[Toronto]]. ''X-Men'' was released to positive reviews and was a financial success, spawning the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]] and a reemergence of [[superhero film]]s.

==Plot==
During the [[Nazi holocaust]] in Poland, a young jewish boy is separated from his parents in an [[extermination camp]]. In an attempt to re-unite with his parents, he starts bending the metal gate using his mind while Nazi soldiers unsuccessfully try to stop him until one of them beats him with a rifle, making him fall unconscious. This boy is reveled to be Magneto. In the year 2000 at the [[United States Congress|Congress]], Senator [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]] attempts to pass a [[Registration acts (comics)|"Mutant Registration Act"]], which would force mutants to publicly reveal their identities and abilities. [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] begins his plans to level the playing field between mutants and humans. Meanwhile, a girl named Marie (a.k.a [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]) runs away from her home in [[Meridian, Mississippi]]. She meets [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] in [[Canada]]. Suddenly, both of them are attacked by [[Sabertooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], a mutant and associate of Magneto. [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] arrive and save Wolverine and Rogue and bring them to the [[X-Mansion]]. [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] runs the facility, and leads a group of mutants who are trying to seek peace with the human race, educate young mutants in the responsible use of their powers, and stop Magneto from starting a war with humanity.

Abducted by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] and [[Toad (comics)|Toad]], Senator Kelly is brought to Magneto, who tests a machine on him that artificially induces mutation though Kelly manages to escape imprisonment with his new abilities. After an accident causes Rogue to use her powers on Wolverine, she is convinced by Mystique (disguised as [[Iceman (comics)|Bobby Drake]]) that Xavier is angry with her and that she should leave the school. Xavier uses [[Cerebro]] to locate Rogue at a train station. Mystique infiltrates Cerebro and sabotages the machine. At the train station, Wolverine convinces Rogue to stay with Xavier but a fight ensues when Magneto, Toad and Sabretooth arrive to take Rogue. Arriving at Xavier's school Kelly dissolves into a puddle of water when his mutation becomes unstable.

The X-Men learn that Magneto intends to combine Rogue's ability with his own to power his machine. Xavier attempts to use Cerebro to locate Rogue but falls into a [[coma]]. [[Jean Grey (comics)|Jean]] fixes it and uses Cerebro to find Magneto's machine on [[Liberty Island]], which Magneto intends to use on the world leaders who are meeting for a summit on nearby [[Ellis Island]]. Just as the group arrives at the top of the statue and kills Toad, Magneto and Sabretooth incapacitate the group and continue with their plans. Magneto transfers his powers to Rogue who is forced to use them to start the machine. Wolverine breaks free and initiates a fight with Sabretooth but is thrown over the side of the statue.

Wolverine returns, and Cyclops, with Jean's help, blasts Sabretooth out of the statue. With Jean stabilizing him, Storm uses her abilities to send Wolverine to the top of Magneto's machine. With time running out, Wolverine attempts to stop the machine and save Rogue, but Magneto, now having regained some of his strength, halts Wolverine's claws. Cyclops manages to find a clean shot, wounding Magneto and allowing Wolverine to destroy the machine. Placing his hand to her face, Wolverine succeeds in transferring his regenerative abilities to a dying Rogue. Professor Xavier recovers from his coma and the group learns that Mystique is still alive (after Wolverine stabbed her at Liberty Island) when they see her impersonating Senator Kelly on a news broadcast. In an attempt to help Wolverine learn more about his past, Xavier sends him to a military base near Alkali Lake. Xavier visits Magneto in his plastic prison cell, and the two play [[chess]]. Magneto warns his friend that he will continue his fight, to which Xavier promises that he (and the X-Men) will always be there to stop him.

==Cast==
* '''[[Hugh Jackman]]''' as '''[[Wolverine (comics)|Logan/Wolverine]]''': A tough, rugged, belligerent loner who makes a living in cage fights. He has lived for fifteen years without memory of who he is, apart from his dog tags marked "Wolverine" and an [[adamantium]]-encased skeleton (as well as adamantium claws). He has the ability to heal rapidly from numerous injuries, including the surgery that bonded the metal to his skeleton, which makes his age impossible to determine.

* '''[[Patrick Stewart]]''' as '''[[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]]''': Founder of the [[X-Men]] and the [[X-Mansion|Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters]], Xavier hopes for peaceful coexistence between mutantkind and mankind and is regarded as an authority on genetic mutation. Although he is restricted to a wheelchair, he is a powerful mutant with vast telepathic abilities. Along with [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], he is the inventor of the [[Cerebro]] [[supercomputer]], which further amplifies his abilities.

* '''[[Sir Ian McKellen]]''' as '''[[Magneto (comics)|Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto]]''': A [[Holocaust]] survivor, he and Xavier were once allies, and they built Cerebro together. However, his belief that humans and mutants could never co-exist lead to their separation. He has powerful magnetic abilities and a sophisticated knowledge in matters of genetic manipulation, which he uses to plan a mutation of the world leaders to allow mutant prosperity.

* '''[[Anna Paquin]]''' as '''[[Rogue (comics)|Marie D'Ancanto/Rogue]]''': A seventeen-year-old girl, forced to leave her family in [[Mississippi]] after putting her boyfriend in a [[coma]] by kissing him. If she touches anyone, she absorbs their strength, memories and abilities, potentially killing them. During her travels, she meets [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], who becomes her closest friend. She begins to have a romance with Bobby Drake.

* '''[[Famke Janssen]]''' as '''[[Jean Grey|Dr. Jean Grey]]''': She is in a relationship with [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and works as the doctor of the X-Mansion. She has the powers of [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]] and [[telepathy]].

* '''[[Bruce Davison]]''' as '''[[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]]''': An anti-mutant politician that supports a Mutant Registration Act and wishes to ban mutant children from schools. He is kidnapped by Magneto in a test of his mutation machine, which causes his body to turn into a liquid-like substance.

* '''[[James Marsden]]''' as '''[[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers/Cyclops]]''': He rescues [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] from a truck explosion, taking them to safety to the [[X-Mansion]] where they live. He is the second leader of the X-Men behind Xavier, and is the team's field leader when they are out on missions as well as an instructor at the Institute. He is in love with Jean Grey and has a relationship with her. He produces a strong red beam of force from his eyes, which is only held in check by specialized ruby-quartz goggles and [[sunglasses]].

* '''[[Halle Berry]]''' as '''[[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe/Storm]]''': She works as a teacher at the X-Mansion and has the ability to manipulate the weather. Ororo has become bitter with other people's hatred for mutants, and while comforting a dying [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Kelly]] says that she sometimes hates humans.

* '''[[Rebecca Romijn|Rebecca Romijn-Stamos]]''' as '''[[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkholme/Mystique]]''': Magneto's loyal second-in-command, her mutant ability to alter her shape and mimic any human being is almost secondary to her role as "the perfect soldier". She is an agile fighter, expert martial artist, and seems completely facile with modern technology. It is unknown whether her blue, scaly skin is her normal physical expression or if it is a choice which sets herself apart from "normal" humans.

* '''[[Ray Park]]''' as '''[[Toad (comics)|Mortimer Toynbee/Toad]]''': A very agile fighter with a menacing streak and a long, prehensile tongue, who can also spit a slimy substance onto others.

* '''[[Tyler Mane]]''' as '''[[Sabretooth (comics)|Victor Creed/Sabretooth]]''': A ferocious, feline-like fighter who attacks [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] in Canada before being stopped by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]].

* '''[[Shawn Ashmore]]''' as '''[[Iceman (comics)|Bobby Drake/Iceman]]''': A student at Xavier's School For Gifted Youngsters who takes a liking to Rogue. He can change temperatures to subzero degrees and use the moisture in the air to create ice.

[[David Hayter]], [[Stan Lee]], and [[Tom DeSanto]] make [[cameo appearance]]s. [[George Buza]], the voice of [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] in ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]'', appeared as the truck driver who drops Rogue off at the bar at which Wolverine works.<ref name=hughes/> [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] was considered for one of the students at the X-Mansion. Singer remembered, "We thought about Gambit as the young boy on the basketball field, but the feeling was that if he has the basketball and then releases it and it exploded, [then] people would be like 'What's wrong with those basketballs?'"<ref name=archive/> A young [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] appears sketching a picture in one scene.<ref name=archive/>

Throughout 1989 and 1990, [[Stan Lee]] and [[Chris Claremont]] were in discussions with [[James Cameron]] and [[Carolco Pictures]] for an ''[[X-Men]]'' film adaptation.

The script focused on the rivalry between Wolverine and Cyclops, as well as the latter's self-doubt as a field leader.

===Casting===
Many actors were considered for roles in the film particularly Wolverine and Cyclops.

[[Patrick Stewart]] was the first and only choice for the role of Charles Xavier since his debut in [[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]. [[Terrence Stamp]] was in the running for the role of Magneto before [[Sir Ian McKellen]] was cast.

For the role of Wolverine, [[Gary Sinise]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Russell Crowe]], [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Aaron Eckhart]], [[Edward Norton]] and [[Jean Claude Van Damme]] were all considered for the role. At one point in the 1990s, [[Glenn Danzig]] was approached to play Wolverine in ad hoc committee ''X-Men'' film, because he bore an uncanny resemblance to the character, as well as being the same height as Wolverine, and very muscular. However, he had to decline, due to the fact that the shooting for the film would force him to put a halt to touring with [[Danzig (band)|his band]] for nine months.<ref>MTV News. [[June 3]], [[1997]]</ref>. Dougray Scott was originally cast as Wolverine. But he was forced to pull out the project due to scheduling conflicts with [[Mission:Impossible II]]. Fox on the other hand wanted [[Keanu Reeves]] for the part.

For the role of Cyclops, [[Thomas Jane]], [[Johnny Lee Miller]], [[Eric Mabius]], [[Owen Wilson]], [[Edward Burns]], [[Edward Norton]] and [[Jude Law]] were considered. [[Michael Biehn]] was at one point considered for the role back in 1989 when James Cameron was developing it. [[James Caviezel]] was originally cast but pulled out before filming began. Wrestler Kevin Nash was offered the role of Sabretooth but he turned down the role due to scheduling conflicts. [[Sarah Michelle Geller]], [[Natalie Portman]] and [[Katharine Isabelle]] were considered for the role of Rogue. [[Angela Bassett]] was offered the role of Storm but she turned it down. Jada Pinkett Smith and Rachel Luttrell were considered for the role. [[Jeri Ryan]] and [[Maria Bello]] were considered for the role of Jean Gray.

===Filming===

===Design and effects===
The filmmakers decided not to replicate the X-Men costumes as seen in the comic book. [[Stan Lee]] and [[Chris Claremont]] supported this decision. Claremont joked, "you can do that on a drawing, but when you put it on people it's disturbing!"<ref name=Origin/> Producer/co-writer [[Tom DeSanto]] had been supportive of using the blue and yellow color scheme of the comics,<ref name=hughes/> but once he saw tests of them, he declared, "No, that just doesn't work." Despite receiving positive feedback from various associates at [[Marvel Comics]] for the black costume design, fans on the internet still had negative emotions when ''X-Men'' was filming.<ref>{{cite news | author = Scott Chitwood | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034827p1.html | title = DeSanto talks about X-Men costumes | work = [[IGN]] | date = 2000-02-10 | accessdate = 2008-08-10}}</ref> To acknowledge the fan complaints, Singer added [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]' line "What would you prefer, yellow spandex?" <U+2013> when Wolverine complains about wearing their uniforms <U+2013> during filming. Singer noted that durable black leather made more sense for the X-Men to wear as protective clothing.<ref name=hughes/>

Wolverine's claws required a full silicone cast of Hugh Jackman's arm, and 700 versions for Jackman and his stunt doubles.<ref>{{cite web| author = Kris Abel | title = Making Wolverine's Claws| work = CTV| date = 2006-10-26| url = http://krisabel.ctv.ca/blog/_archives/2006/10/26/2450347.html| accessdate = 2006-10-26}}</ref> It took nine hours to apply [[Rebecca Romijn]]'s [[prosthetic]] makeup.<ref>{{cite news | author = Rob Worley | title = Bryan Singer's Mutant Agenda | publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = [[2003-04-21]] | url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=2135 | accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref> She could not drink wine, use skin creams, or fly the day before filming, because it could have caused her body chemistry to change slightly, causing the 110&nbsp;prosthetics applied to her skin fall off.<ref name=gen/> Between takes, the makeup department kept Romijn isolated in a windowless room to ensure secrecy.

In the late 1990s, [[computer-generated imagery]] was becoming more commonly used.

[[Digital Domain]]'s [[technical director]] Sean C. Cunningham and lead [[compositing|compositor]] Claas Henke [[morphing|morphed]] Bruce Davison into a liquid figure for Kelly's mutation scene. Cunningham said, "There were many digital layers: water without refraction, water with murkiness, skin with and without highlights, skin with goo in it.

===Reviews===
Based on 143 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 80% were positive, with the consensus that the "story [is] faithful to the comic books and, while the movie may be too Wolverine-centered, it packs a freaky punch that is sure to excite the average summer moviegoer".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/xmen/ | title = X-Men | publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = 2008-08-08}}</ref> 60% of 30 selected popular reviewers gave it positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/xmen/?critic=creamcrop | title = X-Men: Top Critics | publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = 2008-08-08}}</ref> By comparison [[Metacritic]] collected an average score of 64/100 from 33 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/xmen?q=X-Men | title = X-Men (2000): Reviews | publisher = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate = 2008-08-08}}</ref>

[[Kenneth Turan]] found "so much is happening you feel the immediate need of a sequel just as a reward for absorbing it all. While ''X-Men'' doesn't take your breath away wire-to-wire the way ''[[The Matrix]]'' did, it's an accomplished piece of work with considerable pulp watchability to it."<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Kenneth Turan]] | url = http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie000713-5,0,5945193.story | title = Gen-''X'' | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 2000-07-14 | accessdate = 2008-08-08}}</ref> ReelReviews.net's [[James Berardinelli]], an ''X-Men'' comic book fan, believed, "the film is effectively paced with a good balance of exposition, character development, and special effects-enhanced action. Neither the plot nor the character relationships are difficult to follow, and the movie avoids the trap of spending too much time explaining things that don't need to be explained. X-Men fandom is likely to be divided over whether the picture is a success or a failure".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=760 | publisher = [[James Berardinelli]] | title = X-Men | accessdate = 2008-08-08}}</ref> [[Desson Thomson]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' commented, "[T]he movie's enjoyable on the surface, but I suspect many people, even die-hards, will be less enthusiastic about what lies, or doesn't, underneath".<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Desson Thomson]] | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/entertainment/movies/reviews/xmenhowe.htm | title =''X-Men'': Tasty but Not Filling | work= [[The Washington Post]] | date = 2000-07-14 | accessdate = 2008-08-08}}</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' said he "started out liking this movie, while waiting for something really interesting to happen. When nothing did, I still didn't dislike it; I assume the X-Men will further develop their personalities if there is a sequel, and maybe find time to get involved in a story. No doubt fans of the comics will understand subtle allusions and fine points of behavior; they should linger in the lobby after each screening to answer questions."<ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[Roger Ebert]] | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000714/REVIEWS/7140304/1023 | title = X-Men | accessdate = 2008-08-08}}</ref> [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' noted, "Since it's Wolverine's movie, any X-Men or Women who don't hinge directly on his story get short shrift. As Storm, Halle Berry can do neat tricks with weather, but her role is gone with the wind. It sucks that Stewart and McKellen, two superb actors, are underused."<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Peter Travers]] | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949101/review/5949102/xmen | title =''X-Men'' | publisher = [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] | date = [[2000-12-10]] | accessdate = 2008-08-08}}</ref>
