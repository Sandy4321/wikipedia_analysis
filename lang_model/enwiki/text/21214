'''McKeldin Mall''' is a nine-acre area in the heart of the campus of the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. Named after [[Theodore McKeldin]], the former [[Governor of Maryland]], McKeldin Mall is considered to be the largest academic mall in the [[United States]].<ref>http://www.cvs.umd.edu/visitors/attractions.html</ref> The mall is book-ended (east to west) by the Main Administration building and McKeldin Library (the main library on campus) and along the north and south borders by various academic buildings. A 16 feet by 250 foot rectangular fountain features prominently on the eastern half of the mall, honoring the university's members of the [[Omicron Delta Kappa]] society. A sundial, honoring [[Dutch]] [[astronomer]] [[Uco van Wijk]] (who founded the university's astronomy program) sits in the center of the mall, at the edge of the ODK fountain.<ref>http://www.lib.umd.edu/univarchives/macmil/letm.html</ref> A statue of [[University of Maryland, College Park#Testudo|Testudo]], the mascot of the University of Maryland, sits at the front entrance of McKeldin Library, looking towards the Administration Building across the mall. The mall underwent a substantial renovation in 1990.<ref>http://www.lib.umd.edu/univarchives/macmil/letm.html</ref>
