'''Pan Fusheng''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|<U+6F58>|<U+590D>|<U+751F>}}}}; December 1908 <U+2013> April 1980) was a [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] revolutionary and politician. He was the first [[Party chief of the Communist Party of China|party secretary]] of the short-lived [[Pingyuan Province]] of the [[People's Republic of China]], and also served as the First Secretary (i.e. party chief) of [[Henan]] and [[Heilongjiang]] provinces.

During the [[Great Leap Forward]], Pan sympathized with Marshal [[Peng Dehuai]], a critic of [[Mao Zedong]]'s collectivization policy. As a result, in 1958 he was dismissed as party chief of Henan and subjected to brutal persecution, but was later rehabilitated.

When the [[Cultural Revolution]] began, Pan, then party chief of Heilongjiang province, embraced the rebel [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] movement and gained the support of Mao. However, he was soon involved in major factional violence, and was dismissed again in 1971 and put under investigation. In 1982, the Communist Party of China posthumously criticized him for committing "serious mistakes" during the Cultural Revolution.<ref name=guo/>

==Republic of China==
Pan Fusheng was born in December 1908 to a poor peasant family in [[Wendeng]], [[Shandong]] province. His original name was '''Liu Kaijun''' ({{zh|s=<U+5218><U+5F00><U+6D5A>}}), and [[courtesy name]] Juchuan (<U+5DE8><U+5DDD>). Pan was an excellent student in elementary school, and was admitted to Wendeng County Normal School with the highest score in the entrance examination; however, he was later forced to drop out owing to poverty, and taught in a rural elementary school for five years.<ref name=hlj>{{cite web |script-title=zh:<U+6F58><U+590D><U+751F> |trans_title=Pan Fusheng |url=http://www.hljxxw.gov.cn/sqgl/mrfc/t20110520_550325.htm |publisher=Heilongjiang Provincial Government |accessdate=15 October 2014 |language=Chinese |date=20 May 2011}}</ref><ref name=xinhua>{{cite web |script-title=zh:<U+6F58><U+590D><U+751F> |trans_title=Pan Fusheng |url=http://www.sd.xinhuanet.com/wq/2008-01/02/content_12102537.htm |agency=Xinhua News Agency |accessdate=15 October 2014 |language=Chinese}}</ref>

In 1929, he was admitted to the Shandong Number One Rural Normal School, where he was influenced by Communist classmates, and joined the [[Communist Party of China]] in 1931. After the [[Mukden Incident]], which led to the Japanese occupation of [[Manchuria]], Pan organized the Shandong students to join the anti-Japanese and anti-[[Kuomintang]] (KMT) protests in the capital [[Nanjing]]. In March 1932, he was arrested by the KMT government and held at the [[Jinan]] Number One Prison. He was sentenced to ten years for "endangering the Republic", but was released in late 1937, after the eruption of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].<ref name=hlj/><ref name=xinhua/>

After his release from prison, Pan organized and led the Communist guerrillas in Shandong, and later became a leader of the [[Hebei]]<U+2013>[[Shandong]]<U+2013>[[Henan]] (Ji<U+2013>Lu<U+2013>Yu) Communist base. He participated in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the subsequent [[Chinese Civil War]] against the KMT government.<ref name=hlj/><ref name=xinhua/>

==Early PRC==
In August 1949, just before the official establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]], Pan Fusheng was appointed [[Communist Party Secretary]] of the newly established [[Pingyuan Province]]. In March 1950, some peasants and cattle froze to death when transporting grain to government storage in [[Puyang]] prefecture. Pan took partial responsibility for the "Puyang Incident" and was demoted to deputy party chief.<ref name=xinhua/>

In November 1952, Pingyuan Province was abolished and most of it was merged into Henan Province, and Pan Fusheng became the party chief (then called First Secretary) of Henan, succeeding [[Zhang Xi (PRC politician)|Zhang Xi]], and the [[Political Commissar]] of the Henan Military District. In September 1956, he was elected as an alternate member of the [[8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]].<ref name=xinhua/>

==Great Leap Forward==
During the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]] and the [[Great Leap Forward]], Pan Fusheng sympathized with Marshal [[Peng Dehuai]], who criticized Mao's disastrous collectivization policies.<ref name=guo>{{cite book|author1=Guo Jian|author2=Yongyi Song|author3=Yuan Zhou|title=The A to Z of the Chinese Cultural Revolution|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ppYRb4mHEEYC&pg=PA212|year=2009|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8108-6870-0|page=212}}</ref> As a result, he became a major target of persecution by the fervent Mao loyalist [[Wu Zhipu]], the Second Secretary of Henan, with the approval of the [[CPC Central Committee]].<ref name=yang>{{cite book |author=[[Yang Jisheng]] |title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958-1962 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bvs9cS8lzhEC&pg=PT123 |year=2012 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |isbn=978-1-4668-2779-0 |pages=68&ndash;71}}</ref>

During the 9th [[Plenary session|plenum]] of the Henan Provincial Party Congress in June 1958, Pan Fusheng and two lower-ranking officials, Yang Jue and Wang Tingdong, were denounced as the "Pan, Yang, Wang right-deviating anti-party clique", and subjected to brutal [[struggle session]]s.<ref name=yang/> In October 1958, the Communist Party calculated that some 1.6 billion [[big-character poster]]s denouncing them had been written.<ref name=yang/> People who did not put up posters risked being labelled "little Pan Fusheng".<ref name=yang/> Pan was dismissed from office and sent to work as a laborer on a farm.<ref name=guo/><ref name=xinhua/> Wu Zhipu replaced Pan as First Secretary of Henan and zealously implemented Mao's collectivization policy. Under Wu's leadership, Henan was one of the worst affected provinces during the [[Great Chinese Famine]], with nearly 3 million people starving to death from 1959 to 1961.<ref name=yang/>{{rp|84}}

After the end of the Great Leap Forward, Pan was rehabilitated in 1962 and became the minister-level director of the All China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives.<ref name=xinhua/>

==Cultural Revolution==
In October 1965, Pan Fusheng was appointed First Secretary of [[Heilongjiang]] Province in [[Northeast China]] and Political Commissar of the Heilongjiang Military District.<ref name=xinhua/> The [[Cultural Revolution]] erupted shortly afterwards, and on 31 January 1967, Heilongjiang became the first province to set up a [[Revolutionary committee (China)|revolutionary committee]].<ref name=MacFarquhar>{{cite book |author1=[[Roderick MacFarquhar]] |author2=Michael Schoenhals |title=Mao's Last Revolution |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ch0bH0uX8U0C&pg=PA171 |year=2006 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-04041-0 |page=171}}</ref> By enthusiastically embracing the "power seizure" movement by the rebel [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]], Pan was able to gain Mao's support and became a well-known figure throughout China. During the Cultural Revolution, Pan became chairman of the Heilongjiang revolutionary committee in March 1967, one of the only three provincial party chiefs in the country to have transformed from an incumbent provincial First Secretary to head of the revolutionary committee.<ref name=MacFarquhar/> This was considered a rare feat, as the vast majority of provincial First Secretaries were overthrown through power seizures by radicals and Red Guards, or were removed from power through other means.<ref name=MacFarquhar/><ref name=guo/> In April 1968, Pan was elected a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]], and in April 1969, he became a member of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]].<ref name=xinhua/>

Soon after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, however, a faction opposing Pan emerged and sought to remove him from power.<ref name=guo/> Pan became involved in factional violence. He jailed people from the rival faction, including party members and ordinary people. His supporters and opponents fought each other in major armed conflicts, and Pan had serious disagreements with the local military leadership. In June 1971, the central government dismissed him from his posts and put him under investigation.<ref name=guo/>

==Death==
In April 1980, Pan died of a [[stroke]] in [[Harbin]].<ref name=hlj/><ref name=xinhua/> In 1982, the [[CPC Central Committee]] issued a statement criticizing Pan for committing "serious mistakes" during the Cultural Revolution.<ref name=guo/>
