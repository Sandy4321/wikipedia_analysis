'''Arthur A. Bell''' (November 1882 <U+2013> 22 April 1923) was an English [[association football|footballer]] who played as an inside forward for [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] between 1902 and 1909, making 101 league appearances.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Joyce|title=Football League Players' Records 1888-1939|page=22|isbn=1-899468-67-6|year=2004}}</ref> During his career, he won three [[cap (sport)|caps]] for the [[England national amateur football team]].

==Biography==
Bell was born in [[Burnley]], [[Lancashire]], in November 1882 and was educated at the [[Burnley Grammar School]]. An amateur throughout his sporting career, he worked professionally as an [[architect]] and was involved in the building of the new Brunshaw Road stand at the [[Turf Moor]] stadium in Burnley in 1911.<ref>Simpson (2007), p. 574</ref> He died on 22 April 1923, at the age of 40.<ref name="obit">{{cite book|first=Ray|last=Simpson|title=The Clarets Chronicles: The Definitive History of Burnley Football Club|year=2007|isbn=978-0-9557468-0-2|page=159}}</ref>

==Football==
As a youth, Bell played amateur local-league football with Burnley Belvedere before joining [[Football League Second Division]] side [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in February 1902. He made his debut for the club on 10 January 1903 in the 1<U+2013>0 win against [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] at Turf Moor; the winning goal was scored by [[Cuthbert Storey]], who was also playing in his first senior match after transferring from Burnley Belvedere. Bell was selected once more in the 1902<U+2013>03 campaign, playing at left inside forward in the 1<U+2013>3 defeat to [[Leicester Fosse F.C.|Leicester Fosse]] on 24 January 1903.<ref>Simpson (2007), p. 89</ref> He was unable to break into the team for the first five months of the following season due to the form of [[William Jackson (footballer)|William Jackson]], a new signing from [[Barrow A.F.C.|Barrow]]. He made his first appearance of the campaign in the goalless draw away at [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] on 30 January 1904. Bell scored his first competitive goal for Burnley in the 2<U+2013>0 win over [[Gainsborough Trinity F.C.|Gainsborough Trinity]] three weeks later, and on 12 March he netted a late consolation goal in the 1<U+2013>3 loss away to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. In total, Bell played eleven league matches during the 1903<U+2013>04 season and scored four goals.<ref>Simpson (2007), p. 93</ref>

Bell was selected to play in the opening match of the 1904<U+2013>05 season, a 1<U+2013>4 home defeat to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]. In that match, brothers [[Jack Walders|Jack]] and [[David Walders]] played together, the first time Burnley had fielded brothers in a Football League fixture. Bell kept his place in the side for the following match against [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]], but was dropped for the trip to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in favour of youngster [[William Hutchinson (footballer)|William Hutchinson]], a summer signing from [[non-League football|non-League]] club Alston. He was recalled for the visit of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 22 October 1904, deputising for the unavailable [[Doug MacFarlane]], but then spent more than two months out of the team. Bell made two further appearances for Burnley that season, playing in consecutive defeats to Bolton Wanderers and [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in January 1905.<ref>Simpson (2007), p. 97</ref> He found himself more involved in the first-team during the 1905<U+2013>06 campaign, making 19 league appearances. On 13 January 1906, he played in the first [[FA Cup]] game of his career as Burnley were eliminated by [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] side [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the first round. Bell scored his first goal of the season on 10 February 1906, netting the opening goal in the 2<U+2013>2 draw against [[Burslem Port Vale F.C.|Burslem Port Vale]]. During March 1906, he scored in the home wins over [[Leeds City F.C.|Leeds City]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].<ref>Simpson (2007), p. 101</ref>

After missing the first three matches of the 1906<U+2013>07 season due to cricketing commitments, Bell was chosen to replace McFarlane for the visit of [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on 15 September 1906. Two weeks later he scored twice in the 4<U+2013>0 home win over [[Burton United F.C.|Burton United]], and went on to score three more goals in his next four appearances, including a late winner away at Leeds City. However, the victory was overshadowed by the news that Leeds forward [[David Wilson (footballer born 1883)|David Wilson]] had died after collapsing during the match. Bell went on to score a total of 12 goals in 1906<U+2013>07, his highest return in a single season. His performances for Burnley led to a call-up from the [[England national amateur football team|England amateur team]] in April 1907, and he won his first cap in the 8<U+2013>1 defeat of [[Holland national football team|Holland]] in [[The Hague]]. In the match, he played alongside full [[England national football team|England]] internationals [[Vivian Woodward]] and [[Harold Hardman]], who was also a professional architect.<ref>Simpson (2007), p. 107</ref>

Although he again missed the opening month of the following season, Bell quickly reclaimed his status as one of Burnley's first-choice players, starting 26 league matches during the campaign. He scored on his first appearance of the season in the 2<U+2013>2 draw away at [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], and netted a brace in the 5<U+2013>1 win against Grimsby Town on 2 November 1907. Bell scored the only FA Cup goal of his career in the home tie against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on 11 January 1908, but could not prevent the Southern League side securing a 2<U+2013>1 victory. He continued to play for Burnley when work and cricket allowed in the 1908<U+2013>09 campaign, making 15 league appearances. He scored twice during the season; he netted a consolation in the 1<U+2013>4 defeat away at [[Oldham Athletic F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] on 14 November, and scored the winning goal in the 3<U+2013>2 defeat of Barnsley on 5 December. Bell played in 101st and final league game for Burnley in the 0<U+2013>1 loss at Derby County on 26 December 1908, and retired from football shortly afterwards.<ref>Simpson (2007), p. 113</ref>
