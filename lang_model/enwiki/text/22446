'''<U+00C9>tienne-Marie-Antoine-Champion de Nansouty''', '''1st Comte de Nansouty''', (born on 30 May 1768 in [[Bordeaux]];<ref>The [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Inscription_on_General_Nansouty%27s_tombstone.JPG inscription] on his tombstone states that he was born in [[Bourgogne]].</ref> died 12 February 1815 in [[Paris]]), was a French cavalry commander during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], who rose to the rank of [[General of Division]] in 1803 and subsequently held important military commands during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name=Tul>Fierro; Palluel-Guillard; Tulard, p. 978</ref>

Of noble descent, he was a student at the [[Brienne-le-Chateau|Brienne]] military school, then was a graduate of the Paris military school. Nansouty began his military career in 1785, as a [[sublieutenant]] in the regiment ''Bourgogne-Infanterie'', where his father had served during the wars of [[Louis XV]]. A [[cavalry]] officer at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792, Nansouty was commissioned as an ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Nicolas Luckner]]. During the [[War of the First Coalition]], he saw service as a [[lieutenant-colonel]] and squadron commander in the 9th (heavy) Cavalry Regiment, campaigning with the French armies on the [[Rhine]] and in [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]]. Promoted to [[Colonel]] in 1793 and given the command of the 9th Cavalry Regiment, he was noted for several well-led cavalry actions. Made a [[general of brigade|Brigadier General]] in 1799, Nansouty fought the next year under General [[Jean Victor Moreau]] in southern Germany, in a decisive campaign of the [[War of the Second Coalition]]. 

Promoted to the top military rank of General of Division in 1803, Nansouty was called to the command of the 1st Heavy Cavalry Division in [[Emperor of the French|Emperor]] [[Napoleon I]]'s newly created [[Grande Arm<U+00E9>e]]. Commanding this division from 1804 to 1809, Nansouty was present at some of the most significant battles of the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]], [[War of the Fourth Coalition|Fourth Coalition]] and [[War of the Fifth Coalition|Fifth Coaltion]], leading glorious cavalry actions at the battles of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]], [[Battle of Abensberg|Abensberg]], [[Battle of Eckm<U+00FC>hl|Eckm<U+00FC>hl]], [[Battle of Aspern-Essling|Aspern-Essling]] and [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]]. In 1812, during the [[French invasion of Russia|campaign in Russia]], Nansouty was given command of the 1st Cavalry Corps, which he led with distinction at battles such as [[Battle of Ostrovno|Ostrovno]] or [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]], where he received a severe knee wound. The next year, he was given command of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)#Cavalry regiments|Imperial Guard cavalry]], which he commanded in many battles, including [[Battle of Dresden|Dresden]], [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[Battle of Hanau|Hanau]], where he was again wounded. In 1814 he led his troopers in several major engagements, including [[battle of La Rothi<U+00E8>re|La Rothi<U+00E8>re]], [[battle of Montmirail|Montmirail]], [[Battle of Vauchamps|Vauchamps]] or [[battle of Craonne|Craonne]] until his incapacitation from wounds that year.

A member of the military ''<U+00E9>lite'' of the [[First French Empire]], [[Nobility of the First French Empire#Count|Comte]] de Nansouty was a [[Legion of Honour|''Grand Aigle de la L<U+00E9>gion d'Honnerur'']], was a part of the [[Military Household of the Emperor]] as First Squire of the Emperor, and held the position of Colonel-General of [[Dragoon]]s. During the [[Bourbon Restoration]], he was also gratified with a number of honours and commands, including one in the [[Maison militaire du roi de France|Military Household of the King of France]]. General Nansouty died in February 1815 and is buried at the [[P<U+00E8>re Lachaise Cemetery]] in [[Paris]]. His name is one of the [[names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe]] and a street in the [[14th arrondissement of Paris]] is named after him.

==Early life==
<U+00C9>tienne de Nansouty was born on 30 May 1768 in [[Bordeaux]]. His father had served France for 50 years in the regiment of ''Bourgogne-Infanterie'' and had subsequently been appointed 'major' (commander) of the Ch<U+00E2>teau-Trompette fortress in [[Bordeaux]]. <U+00C9>tienne's father fought in all the wars of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], from the [[War of the Polish Succession]] to that of the [[War of the Austrian Succession|Austrian Succession]] and the [[Seven Years' War]]. Quite typically for a member of the minor nobility of the [[Ancien R<U+00E9>gime]], the teenage <U+00C9>tienne de Nansouty chose to follow his father's illustrious footsteps in the military.<ref name=Thoumas4>Thoumas, p. 4.</ref> He was admitted at the military school of [[Brienne-le-Ch<U+00E2>teau]], where he met the young cadet [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleone di Buonaparte]], the future Emperor Napoleon I, with both young men subsequently admitted as ''cadet-gentilhommes'' at the [[<U+00C9>cole Militaire]] in [[Paris]].<ref name=FN>[http://www.napoleon.org/FR/salle_lecture/articles/files/compagnons_Napoleon_Brienne.asp Fondation Napoleon].</ref> Nansouty's grades were excellent and in 1784 he became a chevalier of the Order Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel<ref name=Thoumas4/> and, just like Buonaparte, received this decoration from the hands of ''Monsieur'', the future King [[Louis XVIII]].<ref name=FN/> On 26 May 1785 Nansouty was appointed [[sublieutenant]] in the ''Bourgogne-Infanterie'' regiment, where his father had served with distinction before him.<ref name=Thoumas4/>

Meanwhile, the Nansouty family was leading a tranquil yet modest life in Bordeaux, where Etienne's father was still holding the position of commander of Ch<U+00E2>teau-Trompette, in which he lived with his family, additionally receiving a pension of 1000 ''livres''. He was still holding the position as commander when he died suddenly in 1785, after more than 60 years of active service. His widow had no revenues with which to raise their son and two daughters. However, influential people such as the [[Duchess]] of Brancas and the wife of [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Charles-Just de Beauvau|Beauvau]] contacted the [[Minister of War]], Marshal [[Philippe Henri, marquis de S<U+00E9>gur|de S<U+00E9>gur]], regarding the situation of the young Nansouty. As a result, in 1788, Nansouty was named interim captain in the ''Franche-Comt<U+00E9> Cavalerie'' Regiment (later the 4th ''[[Chasseurs <U+00E0> Cheval]]''). He would not serve in this regiment for long and was soon transferred to the ''Lauzun'' [[Hussar]] Regiment (which became 6th Hussars in 1791, then the 5th Hussars in 1793). He then left the regiment and took up two consecutive military staff positions, first as deputy aid to Adjutant General Poncet de la Cour Maupas in the Army of the Centre on 20 December 1791, then [[aide-de-camp]] of Marshal [[Nicolas Luckner|Luckner]] at the beginning of 1792. He was then promoted to [[lieutenant-colonel]] and took up the command of a squadron of the 2nd ''Chasseurs <U+00E0> Cheval'' (on 5 March), before being transferred to the command of a squadron of the 9th Cavalry Regiment on 4 April, a regiment in which he would serve for the next seven and a half years.<ref name=Thoum2>Thoumas, p. 5</ref>

==Revolutionary Wars==
===War of the First Coalition===
====An officer in the 9th cavalry regiment====
[[File:Court Custine Versailles.jpg|thumb|180px|A portrait of General Adam Philippe de Custine by Joseph-D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9> Court. Nansouty saw military action for the first time as a young lieutenant-colonel of the 9th Cavalry Regiment, in Custine's Corps of the "Army of the Rhine".]]
As the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] broke out, Nansouty soon found himself in the position of having to take provisional command of the whole 9th Cavalry Regiment, as he was the most senior [[lieutenant-colonel]] of the regiment when the commander, Colonel Badda de Bodosalva fell ill at the end of May 1792.<ref name=Thoum2/> His regiment was a part of the [[Army of the Rhine]] and was integrated in General [[Adam Philippe de Custine|Custine's]] Corps, which was to march towards the [[Palatinate]], where the first military maneuvers took place. As Colonel Badda de Bodosalva died at the end of October that year, Nansouty naturally expected to be appointed commander of the regiment in his place. However, Custine appointed the more senior Lieutenant-Colonel Loubat de Bohan as commander of the 9th Cavalry and, despite Nansouty's protestations, maintained his decision. With Loubat in command, the 9th would see action at the battle of Ober-Flersheim on 30 March 1793. After a first successful charge, Nansouty's 1st squadron was countercharged by enemy [[hussars]], but the remaining squadrons under Loubat quickly caught up and broke the enemy. Corps commander Custine was then called-up to command the [[Army of the North]] but, before leaving his command, he attempted a last daunting move against the enemy. The disorganization triggered by a night march, as well as a lack of coordination between the different maneuvers led to total failure of the action of May 17. During this action, the corps cavalry, with the 9th Cavalry included, charged and were initially successful, taking a number of enemy guns, before being countercharged and having to retreat in disorder, spreading panic among the ranks of the infantry that was just coming up.<ref name=Thoum3>Thoumas, p. 6-7</ref>

Despite this setback, a few days later, Lobat de Bohan was promoted to the rank of General and Nansouty again took provisional command of the regiment. When General [[Alexandre, vicomte de Beauharnais|Alexandre de Beauharnais]] took command of the Army of the Rhine, he directed his troops towards [[Mainz]]. Some fighting took place near [[Landau]] and the 9th Cavalry charged several times. Just after this event, the commander of the 2nd Squadron of the regiment invoked the provision of an equivocal new law, demanding that he be given command of the regiment instead of Nansouty. His request was rejected and Nansouty's nomination as commander of the regiment was made permanent.<ref name=Thoum3/>

====Commander of the 9th Cavalry Regiment====
Now holding the rank of colonel in command of the 9th Cavalry Regiment, Nansouty took part in several successful cavalry [[skirmishes]] around [[Strasbourg]], in November and December of 1793 and then took part to the [[Battle of Geisberg (1793)|Battle of Geisberg]]. Following this battle, General of Division Donnadieu, who had commanded the cavalry division of which Nansouty's regiment was a part, was tried and executed for alleged cowardice in front of the enemy. Nansouty was not involved in the incident.<ref>Thoumas, p. 8.</ref> 
[[File:G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ral <U+00C9>tienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty.jpg|thumb|150px|left|A portrait of Nansouty as young officer of the French Revolutionary Army.]]
Despite being a member of the [[Ancien R<U+00E9>gime]] nobility, he was not bothered at any time during the radical phase of the [[French Revolution]]. During the campaigns of 1794, war continued in the [[Rhineland]], with General [[Louis Desaix]] pushing back the [[First Coalition|Coalition]] forces. Nansouty's 9th Cavalry was brigaded together with the 17th [[Dragoon]] Regiment, with General [[Antoine-Guillaume Maurailhac Delmas de La Coste|Delmas de La Coste]] as commander. The brigade performed very well against Austrian cavalry in two distinct actions at the end of May of that year, with General of Division [[Claude Ignace Fran<U+00E7>ois Michaud|Michaud]], the commander-in-chief of the "Army of the Rhine", noting in his report that Delmas's two regiments showed bravery and intrepidity every time they faced the enemy. In July, the 9th Cavalry was involved in numerous glorious cavalry actions and Nansouty acquired an excellent reputation, recognised as a disciplinarian and a commander who knew how to drill his men effectively.<ref>Thoumas, p. 9-10.</ref>

Beginning with December 1794, the French forces on the [[Rhine]] experienced a difficult period, marked by General [[Charles Pichegru]]'s inability to take [[Mainz]], and his replacement as commander-in-chief with General [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau]]. Moreau reorganised the army into three corps, plus a reserve (of which the 9th Cavalry was a part), the latter commanded by Generals [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Antoine Louis Bourcier|Bourcier]] and Forest. The Reserve Cavalry under Bourcier had to intervene at the [[Battle of Ettlingen]], with two squadrons of the 9th being committed and behaving most honourably.<ref>Thoumas, p. 10.</ref> The next significant moment of this campaign was the incident that occurred at dawn on 11 August 1796, when a squadron of the ''[[Carabiniers-<U+00E0>-Cheval]]'' was posted as sentry, a duty that was most unusual for such an ''<U+00E9>lite'' [[heavy cavalry]] unit. At daybreak, as the [[Battle of Neresheim]] was beginning, the ''Carabiniers'' were surprised and charged by Austrian cavalry totally stunning the unprepared cavalrymen, who at once fled in panic, spreading alarm among the ranks of the other cavalry regiments, who were used to seeing the ''Carabiniers-<U+00E0>-Cheval'' triumph against the enemy on every occasion. Nansouty did his best to stop the rout of the cavalrymen and to reorganise the other panic-stricken regiments, but the morale of the cavalrymen remained very low throughout the day and Nansouty was forced to give ground in front of the enemy rather than attempt a risky charge with his demoralised troop. This elicited criticism from the Corps commander, General [[Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr]], who sent his ''aide-de-camp'' to Nansouty with orders to charge, which the latter did after taking the necessary time to deploy his men as he saw fit. Provisionally commanding four cavalry regiments (2nd and 20th ''Chasseurs <U+00E0> Cheval'' and 2nd and 9th Cavalry Regiments), Nansouty organised a superb charge, which completely halted the advance of the Austrian first infantry line. The next day, [[Archduke Charles of Austria]] decided to retreat from the field of battle.<ref>Thoumas, p. 11-14</ref> Nansouty's 9th Cavalry had numerous other opportunities to shine during the campaign of 1796 and rose to the occasion every time.<ref>Thoumas, p. 14.</ref>

===War of the Second Coalition===
[[File:Jean-Joseph-Ange d'Hautpoul.jpg|thumb|180px|The seasoned General of Division Jean-Joseph d'Hautpoul, Nansouty's direct commander in 1799.]]
With the signature of the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], the [[War of the First Coalition]] ended and the 9th Cavalry Regiment was successively attached to the Armies "[[Army of Germany (1797)|of Germany]]", "[[Army of Mainz|of Mainz]]" and then to the "[[Army of the Danube|Army of Danube]]", under the command of [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]]. In 1799, the regiment, with Nansouty commanding it, was integrated into General of Division [[Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul]]'s Cavalry Reserve of the "Army of Danube". However, this army was defeated at the [[Battle of Stockach (1799)|Battle of Stockach]] and had to be merged with General [[Andr<U+00E9> Mass<U+00E9>na]]'s "Army of Switzerland", with the cavalry being sent to the newly formed "[[Army of the Rhine (France)|Army of the Rhine]]". Colonel Nansouty was promoted to the rank of [[brigadier general]] on 29 August 1799 and given the command of a heavy cavalry brigade formed by the 8th and 9th Cavalry Regiments. Later, Nansouty's brigade was provisionally augmented to four regiments, which, alongside Brigadier General [[Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne]]'s four regiments, was included in a 3,000 men strong Cavalry Reserve ([[Carabiniers-<U+00E0>-Cheval|1st and 2nd ''Carabiniers-<U+00E0>-Cheval'']], 6th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 19th and 23rd Cavalry Regiments, with 14 cannons) with command going again to the 45-year-old General d'Hautpoul. Overall command of the "Army of the Rhine" was given to the promising General [[Claude Lecourbe]]. Lecourbe believed his forces to be insufficient for offensive action, so he decided to fall back, with a cavalry combat taking place at the [[Battle of Wiesloch]], where d'Hautpoul's men, and Nansouty's brigade in particular, were heavily engaged. With the campaign coming to an end, after the signing of an armistice, Lecourbe was replaced at the head of the army by [[Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers]], who reorganised d'Hautpoul's Cavalry Reserve, reducing Nansouty's brigade to just the 8th and 9th Cavalry Regiments and Espagne's to the 1st and 2nd ''Carabiniers-<U+00E0>-Cheval''.<ref>Thoumas, p. 14-15.</ref>

====''18 Brumaire'' and campaign in Germany====
With General [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s return from [[French Campaign in Egypt and Syria|Egypt]] in October, the political situation in France changed and the [[18 Brumaire|18 Brumaire Coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] installed the [[French Consulate]], with Bonaparte as First Consul. Bonaparte immediately drew up campaign plans against France's only remaining continental enemy, [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]]. A now reputable cavalry officer, Nansouty was first called to serve in the First Consul's "Army of the Reserve" that was to operate in Italy, but General [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau]] insisted on retaining him in his own "Army of the Rhine", which was to operate in central Germany. Nansouty was thus given command of the cavalry (15th Cavalry, 11th Dragoons and 12th ''Chasseurs <U+00E0> Cheval'') of the Right Wing of the "Army of the Rhine", under the overall command of Corps commander, General of Division [[Claude Lecourbe]].<ref>Thoumas, p. 15-16.</ref>

Commanding the cavalry of this Corps, Nansouty took part to several actions, beginning with the one at the [[Battle of Engen (1800)|Battle of Engen]], where he was noted for his able and daring maneuvers and continued his brilliant actions when he charged the enemy infantry and chased it into the streets of [[Stockach]]. He was then sent to patrol the [[Tyrol]] and there repulsed [[Prince Heinrich XV of Reuss-Plauen|Prince Reuss-Plauen]]'s forces in an action fought on 14 June 1800, the day when [[French Consulate|First Consul]] [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Bonaparte]] was winning at [[Battle of Marengo|Marengo]]. Nansouty served in this region until the end of the [[War of the Second Coalition]], at times as independent commander, or under the successive command of Generals [[Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor|Molitor]] and [[Charles-<U+00C9>tienne Gudin de La Sablonni<U+00E8>re|Gudin]] and commanding as many as five regiments, after the 6th and 8th Hussar Regiments were attached to his force. He acquired a very good reputation during this campaign.<ref name=Thoumas16>Thoumas, p. 16.</ref>

==The years of peace==
[[File:Napoleon Hussard by Bellange.jpg|180px|thumb|A trooper of the 4th hussards. This regiment was a part of Nansouty's division in 1803.]]
With the signing of the [[Treaty of Lun<U+00E9>ville]], a period of peace commenced on the European continent. Meanwhile, however, with the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] allied to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], First Consul [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] decided that a military intervention was necessary against the Lusitan nation. He thus ordered the formation of an Army Corps, called the "Observation Corps of the Gironde" and Nansouty was nominated as commander for the Corps' cavalry, after being chosen from a shortlist of nine excellent cavalry commanders. In view of the invasion of Portugal, the Corps of the Gironde entered [[Kingdom of Spain|Spanish]] territory but it soon returned to France, when a treaty of peace was concluded with the Portuguese government. Nansouty then held various commands, before being named general of division on 24 March 1803, at age 35. A military commander in the department of [[Seine-et-Oise]], he was then sent to command the cavalry (5th [[Chasseurs#chasseurs-<U+00E0>-cheval|''chasseurs-<U+00E0>-cheval'']], 2nd, 4th, 5th [[hussards]] regiments) of General [[Edouard Mortier]]'s "Army of Hanover", where he remained until after de disarmament of the [[Hanover]]ian army and French occupation of the city.<ref name=Thoumas16/>

On 1 February 1804, Nansouty was called to a command in the cavalry reserve of the "Army of the Ocean coast". This nomination came a few months after the reform of the French cavalry arm had begun, in September 1803. The reform reorganized the first twelve regiments of [[heavy cavalry]] of the French Revolutionary army, into regiments of [[cuirassier]]s and a powerful 6-regiment heavy cavalry division, comprising the [[Carabiniers-<U+00E0>-Cheval|1st and 2nd Carabiniers-<U+00E0>-Cheval]], 2nd, 3rd, 9th and 12th cuirassier regiments, was created with the command given to Nansouty. On 29 August 1805 this division was baptised the 1st heavy cavalry division of the newly-created [[Grande Arm<U+00E9>e]]. Nansouty was also named [[Legion of Honour|Commander of the Legion of Honour]] on 14 June 1804 and First Chamberlain of the Empress in 1805.<ref name=Thoumas17>Thoumas, p. 17.</ref>

== Napoleonic Wars ==
===War of the Third Coalition===

With the outbreak of the [[War of the Third Coalition]], a cavalry reserve corps was organised in the [[Grande Arm<U+00E9>e]], with command given to [[Marshal of the Empire|Marshal]] [[Joachim Murat]]. This cavalry reserve included Nansouty's 1st [[heavy cavalry]] division, a 2nd heavy cavalry division under [[Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul|Jean-Joseph d'Hautpoul]], 3 [[dragoon]] divisions, a foot dragoon division and a light cavalry brigade. Nansouty's six-regiment division soon acquired the reputation of being the best serviced and most exact in its maneuvers. His men were at first attached to Marshal [[Louis Nicolas Davout]]'s III Corps, with which they crossed the [[Rhine]] and then the [[Danube]], before rejoining Murat's cavalry reserve. Nansouty had a first opportunity to lead his men into combat at the [[battle of Wertingen]], where his men were again noticed for their excellent maneuvering. Detaching his [[Carabiniers-<U+00E0>-Cheval|two Carabiniers-<U+00E0>-Cheval regiments]], which he had to leave with Murat, Nansouty and his reduced division followed the Emperor at [[Augsburg]], where he was attached to Marshal [[Jean Lannes]]'s V Corps.<ref name="Thoumas17"/> In this capacity, they supported Walther's division at the [[battle of Sch<U+00F6>ngrabern]], then, at the [[battle of Raussnitz]], the 9th [[cuirassier]]s alone took part to a major cavalry action, alongside d'Hautpoul's cuirassier division, Walther's dragoons and [[Jean-Baptiste Bessi<U+00E8>res|Bessi<U+00E8>res]]'s ''[[Grenadiers <U+00E0> Cheval de la Garde Imp<U+00E9>riale|Grenadiers <U+00E0> Cheval]]'' and ''[[1st Chasseurs <U+00E0> Cheval de la Garde Imp<U+00E9>riale|Chasseurs <U+00E0> Cheval]]'' of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Guard cavalry]].<ref name=Thoumas18>Thoumas, p. 18.</ref>

====Charge at Austerlitz====
Having advanced with the bulk of the army into [[Moravia]], on 2 December 1805, at the [[battle of Austerlitz]], Nansouty led one of the most impressive cavalry actions of his career. With his entire division now reunited and again integrated in the Cavalry Reserve under Marshal Murat, Nansouty was positioned on the on the left wing of the army. His command included his usual six regiments of three-squadrons each: [[Brigadier General]] [[Joseph Piston|Piston]]'s 1st and 2nd ''carabiniers-<U+00E0>-cheval'' (205 and 181 men respectively), Brigadier General [[Armand Lebrun de La Houssaye|La Housaye]]'s 2nd and 9th cuirassiers (304 and 280 men respectively) and Brigadier General [[Antoine Louis Decrest de Saint-Germain|Saint-Germain]]'s 3rd and 12th cuirassiers (333 and 277 men respectively). Additionally, a horse battery from the 4th company of the 2nd horse artillery regiment (92 men) was also a part of his command.<ref name=Smith253>Smith, p, 253.</ref> These men were at first positioned on two lines, behind [[Marie-Fran<U+00E7>ois Auguste de Caffarelli du Falga|Caffarelli]]'s infantry division of Lannes's V Corps.<ref name=Thoumas18/> 
[[File:Johann Josef I von Liechtenstein.jpg|thumb|left|190px|The Austrian Prince [[Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein|Johann Josef I von Liechtenstein]] was in command of the cavalry reserve of the Austro-Russian army at Austerlitz. During this battle, his men came off worst from a series of encounters with Nansouty's 1st heavy cavalry division.]]
At around 10 o'clock, after battle had been joined all along the front, Russian General [[Pyotr Bagration]] pulled his forces back before the advancing enemy infantry from the V Corps. However, [[Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein]], commanding the 4,000-sabre Austro-Russian cavalry reserve, threw his cavalry into combat against Murat's 6,000 sabres. The Austro-Russians did not provide infantry or artillery support to the cavalry attack, while Murat's cavalrymen were able to cooperate with Lannes's infantry and artillery. Taking immense casualties after a first series of actions against Lannes's infantry, the Coalition cavalry withdrew and was reformed by its commanders. They were also joined by Bagration's own cavalry force and set off again, this time aiming directly at Murat's command centre. As the Austro-Russian cavalry was closing in on its target, they were steadily met by four of Nansouty's regiments (the two ''carabiniers'' regiments and the 2nd and 3rd cuirassiers). The sound of the impact of the two masses of cavalrymen was heard some distance away. After a brief combat, the Austro-Russian horsemen broke and were driven off.<ref name=Smith56-57>Smith, p. 56-57.</ref> However, Liechtenstein soon reformed his men and, seeing that all the French cavalry was positioned on the left of Caffarelli's infantry division, he launched his men against the right wing of this division, but was instantly met with sustained [[musket]] volleys that disorganised his cavalrymen. Seeing this development, Nansouty wheeled right with his men and crossed  the infantry intervals by [[platoon]]s, and then formed his men on two battle lines in front of the infantry. Three charges ensued in brief succession, with Nansouty skillfully committing the 1st and 2nd ''carabiniers-<U+00E0>-cheval'' with the 2nd cuirassiers in his first line and the 9th cuirassiers and Saint-Germain's 3rd brigade in second line. The Austro-Russian cavalry was finally broken and repulsed for good.<ref name=Thoumas18-19>Thoumas, p. 18-19.</ref> After another series of well-coordinated cavalry and infantry actions, Murat and Lannes were able to force Bagration's entire force to withdraw and leave behind 2,000 casualties and 16 guns.<ref name="Smith56-57"/> 

Despite their repeated charges on this day, the 1st heavy cavalry division registered only relatively minor casualties: Piston's 1st brigade registered 2 killed and 41 wounded, La Houssaye's 2nd brigade registered 1 man killed and 25 wounded, while Saint-Germain's 3rd brigade registered 47 killed and 28 wounded. The regiment that suffered the highest casualty rate was by far the 3rd cuirassiers, with 44 killed and 27 wounded, for a casualty rate of 21%.<ref name=Smith253/> Nansouty's charge was qualified as "superb and brilliant" in the report drawn up by General [[Augustin Daniel Belliard]], Murat's chief of staff, with Nansouty subsequently quoted in the army bulletin for this action and named ''[[Legion of Honour|Grand Officier de la L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur]]'' on 25 December. Additionally, of the six colonels in his division, three were promoted to Brigadier General and three received the cross of ''Commandeur de la L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur''.<ref name=Thoumas18-19/> Following the [[peace of Pressburg]] with the [[Austrian Empire]] in late December 1805, Nansouty's division was stationed in [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]], where they took winter quarters.<ref name=Thoumas18-19/>

===War of the Fourth Coalition===
====Campaign in Prussia====
[[File:Charles Meynier - Napoleon in Berlin.png|250px|thumb|The triumphal parade of the Grande Arm<U+00E9>e in the [[Prussia]]n capital of [[Berlin]] on 25 October 1806.]]
As the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]] broke out in September 1806, [[Emperor of the French|Emperor]] [[Napoleon I]] took his [[Grande Arm<U+00E9>e]] into the heart of [[Confederation of the Rhine|Germany]] in a memorable blitz campaign against [[Prussia]]. Comprising the same regiments as the year before ([[Carabiniers-<U+00E0>-Cheval|1st and 2nd ''Carabiniers-<U+00E0>-Cheval'']], 2nd, 3rd, 9th and 12th cuirassiers), Nansouty's 1st [[heavy cavalry]] division was again a part of [[Joachim Murat]]'s Cavalry Reserve. At first, due to the extraordinary speed of Napoleon's operations, the 1st heavy cavalry division, as well as one of the two cuirassier brigades of [[Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul|d'Hautpoul's]] 2nd heavy cavalry division had difficulties arriving to the frontline, and thus missed the [[battle of Jena-Auerstaedt|battle of Jena]]. Beginning with the evening of 14 October, Nansouty did take part to the pursuit of the routed [[Prussia]]n army, following an enemy corps of 10,000 infantrymen and 3 cavalry regiments into the streets of [[Erfurt]] on 15 October. With the enemy blocked in the city, by nightfall, Colonel Pr<U+00E9>val, of the 3rd cuirassiers had negotiated the [[capitulation of Erfurt]], which resulted in the capture of 11,000 [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] (of which 6,000 wounded), as well as 120 cannon.<ref name=Thoumas20>Thoumas, p. 20.</ref>

Resuming its pursuit of the Prussian army, Nansouty's division was at [[Potsdam]] beginning with 25 October and two days later they participated to the triumphant parade of the Grande Arm<U+00E9>e in [[Berlin]], before being reviewed by the Emperor on 30 October. Beginning with 7 November, Nansouty and his division were with Murat, heading for the river [[Vistula]], which they crossed on December 22, together with the rest of the Cavalry Reserve. After a brief successful cavalry action at the Lapazin bridge, they tried to get to the [[battle of Golymin]] in time, but were delayed by the thick mud and by the dragoon division that preceded them, arriving only after the end of the battle.<ref name=Thoumas20/> The division then took winter quarters in [[Warsaw]], but with Murat on sick leave, Nansouty was soon called to replace him, taking command of [[Antoine Charles Louis de Lasalle|Lasalle]]'s light cavalry division and the dragoon divisions of [[Louis Klein|Klein]] and [[<U+00C9>douard Jean Baptiste Milhaud|Milhaud]]. These divisions were placed in the first line of the army and Nansouty, although formally placed under the overall command of [[Marshal of the Empire|Marshal]] [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult]], had orders to act independently and report directly to the Emperor in case any unforeseen and extraordinary events should occur. Nansouty handled this new mission with care, personally patrolling the frontline and deciding where to place the [[Picket (military)|picket]]s of light cavalry that were to cover the infantry outposts.<ref name=Thoumas21>Thoumas, p. 21.</ref>

====Campaign in Poland: early maneuvers====
[[File:Napoleon Carabinier of 1810 by Bellange.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Before 1810, the two [[heavy cavalry]] regiments of ''[[carabiniers-<U+00E0>-cheval]]'' wore no [[cuirass]]. They were a part of Nansouty's heavy cavalry division between 1804 and 1809.]]
With the news of the alarming Russian operations against the left wing of the army, Murat resumed command of the cavalry reserve, ordering Nansouty to follow the concentration of the army towards [[Preu<U+00DF>isch Eylau]]. Joining his men in Warsaw, Nansouty diligently led them towards his assigned destination, but arrived only on 13 February 1807, five days after the [[battle of Eylau]], too late to take part to any action. On 14 February, Nansouty learned of the death of his comrade and former commander during the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolutionary Wars]], General d'Hautpoul, who had been fatally wounded during his heroic charges at Eylau. As the Emperor decided that the army was to take winter quarters and in order to ensure the safety of his outposts, he sent Murat with a powerful column, including Nansouty's men, with the mission of pushing back any enemy they might find. A short skirmish involving the 1st heavy cavalry division occurred at Wolfsdorf on 10 March, before it was decided that all the heavy cavalry would be sent to the lower Vistula, where they were to rest and be reinforced.<ref name=Thoumas21/>

With its ranks replenished after the winter actions, the six-regiment division under Nansouty numbered, on 1 June 1807, no less than 3,257 men and was by far the most powerful heavy cavalry division of the Cavalry Reserve, which then comprised two other such divisions, the 2nd under [[Raymond-Gaspard de Bonardi de Saint-Sulpice|Saint-Sulpice]] and a newly-added 3rd, under [[Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne|Espagne]].<ref>Garnier, p. 48.</ref> As military operation resumed later in 1807, Nasouty's division was hastily directed towards the town of Deppen, where Marshal [[Michel Ney]] had managed to retreat with his Corps, after energetically extricating himself from a dangerous situation, with surprisingly few losses.<ref name=Thoumas22>Thoumas, p. 22.</ref>  With Ney's Corps, the Cavalry Reserve and the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Guard]], Napoleon moved towards [[Guttstadt]], where on 9 June he found a numerous combined-arms enemy force.  Murat took with him Lasalle's light horse and Nansouty's heavy cavalry and, after a series of charges, at once drove back the enemy force, pushing them into the streets of Guttstadt, where he penetrated with the cavalry by nightfall. Having fought well with his men, Nansouty was rested the next day, leaving all the action at the [[battle of Heilsberg]] to Espagne's 3rd heavy cavalry division.<ref name=Thoumas22/>

Assessing the strategic situation at the beginning of June 1807, the Emperor decided that he needed to move northeast, in order to prevent [[Levin August, Count von Bennigsen|Benningsen]]'s Russian army from using the bridge at [[Friedland]] to cross the [[Alle]] river. If the Russians managed to cross the Alle at Friedland, they could then move closer to their Prussian allies, who were based in [[K<U+00F6>nigsberg]]. Napoleon thus drew up his plan, giving Marshal Murat two army Corps and a powerful cavalry reserve, with orders to march on to K<U+00F6>nigsberg, while ordering the rest of the troops towards Friedland. Leading the thrust towards Friedland was Marshal [[Jean Lannes]]'s Reserve Corps (two infantry divisions and one cavalry brigade), to which were temporarily attached [[Emmanuel de Grouchy, Marquis de Grouchy|Grouchy]]'s dragoons and Nansouty's horse ''carabiniers'' and cuirassiers. In Murat's absence, Grouchy was the senior cavalry commander and was to take overall command of all the cavalry that remained with the Emperor.<ref name=Thoumas22/>

====Campaign in Poland: Friedland====
[[File:Napoleon salute.jpg|thumb|250px|Nansouty's cuirassiers charging at the battle of Friedland on 14 June 1807.]]
Arriving with his Corps at Friedland on 13 June after nightfall, Lannes found the position already occupied by Russian forces.<ref name=Thoumas22/> Very early on 14 June, despite having an almost symbolic force (between 11,000 and 13,500 men) against the might of a massed enemy army of 85,000, Lannes intrepidly decided to attack, in order to prevent the enemy from crossing the Alle and to give Napoleon enough time to arrive with the remainder of his forces. Nansouty's division arrived on the [[Battle of Friedland|field of battle at Friedland]] after the first engagements and was directed towards the strategic village of Heinrichsdorf, where laid Lannes's communications with the rest of Napoleon's army. Grouchy also directed his dragoon division towards the village and was shocked to find it in enemy hands and Nansouty's men retreating at a trot, without even attempting to contain the enemy or to cover the route that represented the Corps' communication line.<ref>Garnier, p. 50-51.</ref> In fact, Nansouty had arrived not long before and had been instructed to place himself at Heinrichsdorf, without further instructions and without being informed of what was happening on the right. As Russian infantry and cavalry were boldly pressing him, he became concerned with his own lines of communication and thus ordered his men back, to avoid being cut off.<ref>Thoumas, p. 23-24.</ref> 
[[File:Napoleon friedland.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Napoleon giving orders for an attack at the battle of Friedland. General Nansouty had an important role during this battle and is honoured by being depicted alongside the Emperor (on his left) in this painting by [[Horace Vernet]].]]
However, Nansouty's move compromised Lannes's entire plan, which counted on powerful reinforcements arriving through Heinrichsdorf. An alarmed Lannes immediately sent one of his ''[[aides de camp]]'' to Grouchy urging him to stop the enemy from cutting his communications with the Emperor, whatever the cost. Grouchy duly took command of Nansouty's leading squadrons, ordering them back to their initial position, then launched a desperate but successful charge with his own dragoons, arriving into the streets of the village and cutting off its Russian defenders. However Grouchy's dragoons had become disorganised following this sudden charge and, with the Russian cavalry countercharging them, they were in a very bad position, but Nansouty arrived to the rescue just at the right moment and the French repulsed the Russian cavalry, momentarily securing the position.<ref>Garnier, p. 51-52.</ref> A lively argument ensued between the two cavalry commanders, with Grouchy invoking his seniority and position as commander of the cavalry and criticising Nansouty's earlier decision to withdraw and Nansouty countering by expressing his belief that he had superior experience at handling cavalry. With combat resuming, the quarrel did not prevent Nansouty from performing brilliant further actions under Grouchy's command during the dramatic series of events that followed. In fact, having been repulsed earlier, the Russians decided to force the position at Heinrichsdorf and to that effect, they assembled a strong infantry force, preceded by no less than 60 cavalry squadrons, plus around 2,000 Cossacks. To counter this move, Grouchy opted for deception, luring some of the enemy cavalry away from the infantry. Then, Grouchy charged the enemy horse from the front, with Nansouty hitting them from the flank and repulsing them altogether. Numerous charges and countercharges ensued, with the French cavalry always maintaining the upper hand.<ref name=Thoumas25-27>Thoumas, p. 25-27.</ref>

With the arrival of the Emperor, who brought significant reinforcements, Grouchy received orders to incessantly harass the enemy, in order to prevent Benningsen from reinforcing his left wing, and also to try and silence the enemy guns that had started to pound the French left. In this difficult task, Grouchy was perfectly seconded by Nansouty and together they managed to put an end to the Russian cannonade in this sector. Later, with the battle won in brilliant fashion by the Emperor's timely arrival, Grouchy expressed in his report his admiration for Nansouty's actions, adding that the latter had "gloriously repaired" his earlier error. Nansouty was also quoted in the 79th Bulletin of the Grande Arm<U+00E9>e. After the battle, the 1st heavy cavalry division joined in the pursuit of the Russian army to the [[Nieman]] river, but the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] in July soon ended hostilities.<ref name=Thoumas25-27/>

===Count of the Empire, First Squire and the Peninsula===
[[File:MWP Legion Star.JPG|thumb|200px|The [[Legion of Honour|''Grand Aigle de la L<U+00E9>gion d'Honnerur'']] decoration.]]
The numerous honours and [[Financial endowment|endowments]] that General Nansouty received following the battle of Friedland seem to suggest the Emperor's appreciation and the fact that Napoleon did not regard the early incident during this battle as being Nansouty's fault. On 11 July 1807, General of Division Nansouty was named [[Legion of Honour|''Grand Aigle de la L<U+00E9>gion d'Honnerur'']],<ref name=Thoumas25-27/> the fifth and top rank of this order, reserved to the very greatest [[general officer]]s.<ref>Pigeard, ''Dictionnaire de la Grande Arm<U+00E9>e'', p. 368.</ref> This also brought an annual revenue of 20,000 Francs. His first [[financial endowment|endowment]], amounting to 12,846 Francs was offered on 30 June 1807, and was paid by the [[Duchy of Warsaw]]. On 23 September, he received a second one of 5,882 Francs on the Empire's ''Grand Livre''. A count of the Empire from 10 March 1808, Nansouty was offered two additional endowments, one of 25,000 Francs, paid by the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] and the second of 10,000 Francs, paid by the Zeven domain in [[Hannover]].<ref name=Thoumas27>Thoumas, p. 27.</ref> Now a member of the Empire's upper class, Nansouty bought his own [[Paris]]ian [[H<U+00F4>tel particulier]], the ''H<U+00F4>tel du Pr<U+00E9>sident Duret'', in the [[Faubourg Saint-Germain]], a neighborhood that had become typical for the military ''<U+00E9>lite'' of that period, with the likes of Viceroy of [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]] [[Eug<U+00E8>ne de Beauharnais|Eug<U+00E8>ne]], [[Marshal of the Empire|Marshals]] [[Louis Nicolas Davout|Davout]] or [[Jean Lannes|Lannes]] or Generals [[Jean Rapp|Rapp]] and [[Claude Legrand|Legrand]] also acquiring residences there.<ref>Tulard, vol. 2, p. 401.</ref>

Additionally, in 1808, he was offered the position of  [[Premier <U+00C9>cuyer de l'Empereur|First Squire of the Emperor]], in [[Military Household of the Emperor|Napoleon's Military Household]], a dignity that offered an annual revenue of 30,000 Francs and which became extremely important because the [[Grand <U+00C9>cuyer de l'Empereur|Grand Squire]], General [[Armand Augustin Louis de Caulaincourt]], was sent to [[Saint-Petersburg]] as ambassador. Napoleon allegedly chose Nansouty for his elegant manners and education, aristocratic posture and talent for administration. In his capacity as First Squire, Nansouty thus had to accompany the Emperor during the latter's short [[Peninsular War#Napoleon's campaign (October 1808<U+2013>January 1809)|campaign]] in Spain (from November 1808 to early January 1809). There, he was in charge of several administrative tasks linked with managing the Emperor's stable services and suite and commanding his orderly officers. The Emperor's ''aides-de-camp'' had their own ''aides-de-camp'', who were also placed under the command of the First Squire. In Spain, Nansouty acquired quite a reputation for excessive mockery, even regarding the daily aspects of his service.  Although never very far away from the Emperor, in a campaign that included many battles, Nansouty himself never exercised a field command during this campaign and in January 1809, he accompanied his master back to France, as the outbreak of the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]] was imminent.<ref>Thoumas, p. 27-28.</ref>

===War of the Fifth Coalition===
In early 1809, the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] war preparations determined the Emperor to leave Spain and head back to [[Paris]] to reorganise his main army in Germany. In spring, Nansouty was therefore recalled to the command of 1st of the three [[heavy cavalry]] divisions of the Cavalry Reserve, placed this time under the command of [[Marshal of the Empire|Marshal]] [[Jean-Baptiste Bessi<U+00E8>res]]. As the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]] broke out, Nansouty's division was soon detached from the Reserve and temporarily attached to Marshal [[Louis Nicolas Davout]]'s III Corps, the force that was assigned the most difficult tasks during the early military operations of this war. As Napoleon then ordered a concentration of the army at [[Regensburg|Ratisbon]], Nansouty's division was once again put under the command of Bessi<U+00E8>res and sent to serve with the [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavarian]] army. After his initial victories at [[Battle of Abensberg|Abensberg]] and [[Battle of Landshut (1809)|Landshut]], Napoleon concentrated the bulk of his army, including Nansouty's men, at [[Eckm<U+00FC>hl]], where Davout was waiting.<ref>Thoumas, p. 29-30.</ref>

====Eckm<U+00FC>hl and Ratisbon====
[[File:Napoleon Cuirassier in 1809 by Bellange.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A French cuirassier in 1809, fully equipped for shock action.]]
Napoleon faced [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]]'s Austrian army at the [[battle of Eckm<U+00FC>hl]], on 21<U+2013>22 April 1809. On 22 April, the second day of the battle, Nansouty was at first sent to the Schierling plain, in support of Bavarian General [[Bernhard Erasmus von Deroy|Deroy]], who, after several failed attempts, managed to take the town of [[Eckm<U+00FC>hl]] from the enemy.<ref name="Pigeard266"/> Apart from the Schierling plain, the terrain at Eckm<U+00FC>hl was very uneven and hilly, with dangerously steep slopes, which made cavalry action here improper. Yet, it was here that one of the most memorable cavalry actions of the entire [[Napoleonic Wars]] was to take place. It all began on the slopes next to Eckm<U+00FC>hl, where a first brief cavalry engagement occurred, as Bavarian and [[Kingdom of W<U+00FC>rttemberg|W<U+00FC>rttemberger]] cavalry encountered and charged Austrian cavalry. Having been repulsed, the [[Rhine Confederation|German]] horsemen withdrew and reformed in the vicinity of the two French heavy cavalry divisions present. These two divisions, the 1st under Nansouty ([[Carabiniers-<U+00E0>-Cheval|''1st and 2nd carabiniers-<U+00E0>-cheval'']], 2nd, 3rd, 9th and 12th cuirassiers) and the 2nd under [[Raymond-Gaspard de Bonardi de Saint-Sulpice|Saint-Sulpice]] (four regiments strong), were placed next to one another, forming five lines, with their regiments in column, one in front of the other. These men were ordered forward, up the slope and onto the plateau where the light cavalry had been repulsed moments earlier. Arriving on the plateau at a [[Horse gait#gallop|gallop]], the cavalry overtook Marshal [[Jean Lannes|Lannes]]'s infantry, who admiringly cheered and applauded as they passed by, crying "''Vive les cuirassiers''" ("Long live the cuirassiers"). With their two frontline regiments now deployed in line and with the German light cavalry protecting their flanks, the two heavy cavalry divisions clashed into whatever Austrian cavalry they could find on the plateau, repulsing them with ease. This was, however, only the prelude of a much larger cavalry combat.<ref>Thoumas, p. 30-31.</ref>

In order to protect his retreat, Archduke Charles of Austria reunited his entire cavalry reserve, 44 squadrons in all, on either side of the Ratisbon road,<ref name=Thoumas31-32>Thoumas, p. 31-32.</ref> next to the village of [[Eggolsheim]].<ref name=Pigeard266>Pigeard, ''Dictionnare des batailles de Napol<U+00E9>on'', p. 266.</ref> Between seven<ref name=Thoumas31-32/> and eight o'clock<ref name=Pigeard266/> in the evening, Napoleon ordered his cavalry to disperse the enemy horse from this position. In preparation of the charge, Nansouty formed five of his regiments in two lines: three regiments in the first line and two in the second line, leaving his remaining regiment with Saint-Sulpice. Saint-Sulpice's division was on Nansouty's right and it remained formed in regiment column formations, while the light cavalry was protecting the flanks of the whole. In all, the French had 48 squadrons, and, as they advanced, they were met by intense artillery fire from the Austrian batteries and then vigorously charged by the Gottesheim cuirassier regiment. Seeing the enemy charging, Nansouty ordered his squadrons forward towards the enemy, but at a gentle [[Trot (horse gait)|trot]]. Then, as soon as the Austrians were at about one hundred paces, the frontline regiment of ''[[Carabiniers-<U+00E0>-Cheval]]'' halted, loaded their [[carbine]]s and fired a salvo from thirty or forty paces, then drawing their swords and joining their fellow [[cuirassier]]s in an energetic charge. As Nansouty led, Saint-Sulpice followed and, despite the vigor and determination of the Austrian cavalry, they were repulsed after a brief hand-to-hand combat. Coming in support of the Gottesheim cuirassiers, the ''Kaiser'' cuirassier regiment shared the same fate, with Sitpsicz's [[hussard]]s and Vincent's [[Chevau-l<U+00E9>ger|''chevaulegers'']] also repulsed. A generalised and bloody ''m<U+00EA>l<U+00E9>e'' then occurred under the moonlight, with the sabre hits on the steel [[cuirass]]es producing sparkles in the night. Austrian General Scnheller was wounded during this action and General Suterheim, commanding the entire Austrian cavalry, only just escaped capture. The Austrian cavalry was repulsed and pushed into the marshes beyond,<ref name=Thoumas31-32/> subsequently retreating towards [[K<U+00F6>fering]], with the bulk of Archduke Charles's forces retreating towards Ratisbon.<ref name=Pigeard266/>

The pursuit resumed the next day at dawn, and was followed by yet another action at the [[battle of Ratisbon]], where the Austrians tried to delay the French pursuit. After fierce fighting, during which Nansouty's and Saint-Sulpice's men successfully charged the enemy cavalry three times, the French captured the citadel at Ratisbon, but saw the Austrians skillfully retreating. Nansouty was left at Ratisbon with Davout, to observe the retreat of Archduke Charles.<ref>Thoumas, p. 32.</ref>

====Aspern-Essling====
[[File:Horace Vernet-Charge of the cuirassiers.jpg|thumb|250px|French cuirassiers from the 3rd regiment during a charge. At the battle of Aspern-Essling, the 3rd cuirassiers was a part of the brigade of General Antoine de Saint-Germain, under the overall command of General of Division Nansouty.]]
On 21 May 1809, Napoleon crossed the [[Danube]] not far from [[Vienna]] and attacked Archduke Charles's Austrian army, situated on the northern bank of the river, in what became known as the [[battle of Aspern-Essling]]. The French were nonetheless critically outnumbered and it soon became obvious that they would have a hard time just holding out. Nansouty could only get one of his brigades, [[Antoine Louis Decrest de Saint-Germain|Saint-Germain]]'s 3rd and 12th cuirassiers, across the Danube for the action on 21 May. He found the heroic cuirassiers of General [[Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne]] charging, as they had done all day long, in a desperate attempt to stop Austrian attacks on the thin French battle line. Espagne had just been killed in action and his exhausted and depleted squadrons needed to be relieved. Nansouty at once brought forward Saint-Germain's squadrons and charged the enemy infantry, allowing the army to maintain itself on the position.<ref name=Thoumas35>Thoumas, p. 35.</ref> 

On the second day of the battle, 22 May, Nansouty received his second cuirassier brigade, [[Jean-Pierre Doumerc|Doumerc]]'s 2nd and 9th regiments. During the morning, having received some reinforcements, Napoleon sent Marshal Lannes's Corps forward, in an attack against the enemy line. Nansouty's and [[Antoine Charles Louis de Lasalle|Lasalle]]'s cavalry protected the infantry columns, charging the enemy cavalry to clear their path. However, at around nine o'clock in the morning, news that the great bridge over the Danube had broken, making the arrival of further reinforcements virtually impossible, forced Napoleon to call off his attack and order a phased retreat. The situation of the French army was critical, with Marshal Lannes fatally wounded, and a great number of losses in men. It took all the skill of Nansouty and the other cavalry commanders to contain the formidable Austrian onslaught in order to allow the rest of the army to gradually disengage. After most of the army had safely crossed an arm of the Danube onto the island of [[Lobau]], Nansouty's men were also withdrawn from the battlefield during the night, with the French cavalry subsequently celebrated for their role in preventing a catastrophic defeat that day.<ref name=Thoumas35/>

====Wagram====
[[File:Cuirassiers-Wagram.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Nansouty's cuirassiers charging at the battle of Wagram. Painting by Guido Sigriste.]]
After the bloody debacle at Aspern-Essling, Napoleon took six weeks to carefully plan another crossing of the Danube. He launched this operation late on 4 July and, by the early hours of the next day, he had managed to get a substantial force across the river. Nansouty's division did not see any action that day and at night they camped behind the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]]. The next day, 6 July, Nansouty was at first directed to support Davout, on the French right, but when it became clear that the latter's sector was not threatened by the arrival of enemy reinforcements, they were ordered back into reserve in a central position on the battlefield, not far from the village of [[Aderklaa]]. Then, as the situation on the French left rapidly deteriorated, they were called into action, when Napoleon ordered Marshal [[Jean-Baptiste Bessi<U+00E8>res|Bessi<U+00E8>res]], commander of the Cavalry Reserve, to launch his men in a charge against the Austrians menacing his left. With time at the essence, Bessi<U+00E8>res opted not to wait for the Guard cavalry and, with his other two heavy cavalry divisions assigned to other sectors of the battlefield, he decided to lead forward only Nansouty's men.<ref>Thoumas, p. 36.</ref> This division was indeed very strong: 24 squadrons, more than 4,000 men, including [[Brigadier General]] [[Jean-Marie Defrance|Defrance]]'s 1st and 2nd ''carabiniers-<U+00E0>-cheval'', Brigadier General Doumerc's 2nd and 9th cuirassiers and Brigadier General [[Sigismond-Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric de Berckheim|Berckheim]]'s 3rd and 12th cuirassiers.<ref>Chandler, p. 23.</ref> 

Bessi<U+00E8>res and Nansouty led these men forward, though a hail of [[cannonball]]s and [[case-shot]], with the ''carabiniers-<U+00E0>-cheval'' at the front. Finding a weaker spot in the Austrian line, they pierced it and stormed past the enemy infantry formed in squares, sabering the ''Georger'' battalion as they went along their way. However, many of the French cavalry did not manage to penetrate through the formidable masses of Austrian infantry, so Nansouty was now commanding a much diminished force. Showing great skill in handling his men, Nansouty then wheeled right and charged [[Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]]'s artillery line. However, the Austrian cavalry promptly intervened, spearheaded by the Rosenberg [[Chevau-l<U+00E9>ger|''chevaulegers'']] and the ''Kronprinz'' cuirassier regiments, which caught the ''carabiniers-<U+00E0>-cheval'' in flank and repulsed them, pursuing them back to their lines. The costly repulse of Nansouty's division did not dishearten Bessi<U+00E8>res, who was preparing another rapid charge, now with the support of elements of the Guard cavalry. This charge never came, as the Marshal's horse was killed by a cannonball, with Bessi<U+00E8>res also hit and carried unconscious behind the lines.<ref name=Arnold149>Arnold, p. 149.</ref> With his commander presumed dead, Nansouty did not know what the Emperor's orders were and thus promptly decided to pull back his men, to avoid further damage to his already battered division.<ref name=Thoumas36-37>Thoumas, p. 36-37.</ref>

This however was not to be the end of General Nansouty's action at the great battle of Wagram. Although the great cavalry attack had done much to ease the pressure on Napoleon's left-centre, the latter's situation remained critical. The Emperor thus launched the Corps of General [[Jacques MacDonald]] in an attack against the Austrian right-centre.<ref>Pigeard, ''Dictionnaire des batailles...'', p. 922.</ref> MacDonald's attack formation, formed by chance more than by any tactical forethought, was a huge infantry attack column or square, comprising all his divisions in a deep formation that was highly unusual for Napoleonic warfare.<ref>Sokolov, p. 224-225.</ref> Four squadrons of Nansouty's ''carabiniers-<U+00E0>-cheval'' were sent to support the flank of this attack, with the rest of his division further back.<ref name="Thoumas, p. 37">Thoumas, p. 37.</ref> Realising that his advance is hampered by intense Austrian artillery fire, MacDonald aimed to clear the enemy guns before him, asking for a cavalry charge from [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Henri Walther|Walther]]'s Guard cavalry on his right and Nansouty's 1st heavy cavalry division on his left. With no direct orders from the Emperor and his commander, Marshal Bessi<U+00E8>res, out of action, Walther opted not to move,<ref>Sokolov, p. 455.</ref> while Nansouty did send his men forward but, having been positioned too far back, he arrived only after the enemy guns had moved away.<ref name="Thoumas, p. 37"/>

Nansouty's division suffered a very high casualty rate at the battle of Wagram, with more men and horses lost than the other two heavy cavalry divisions combined. Losses in horses were extremely high, with 1,141 animals killed or injured, while losses in men were also significant, despite the fact that only the ''carabiniers-<U+00E0>-cheval'' really came into contact with the enemy. Overall, Nansouty's division lost 164 men killed and 436 wounded. Foremost of all, the highly-battered two ''carabiniers-<U+00E0>-cheval'' regiments had no more than 300 horses standing between themselves by the end of the day, for an equine casualty rate of 77 percent,<ref name=Arnold149/> with the 9th and 12th cuirassiers also suffering high casualties.<ref name="Thoumas, p. 37"/> Bessi<U+00E8>res's charge, hastily organised with only the division of Nansouty, through murderous artillery fire and against masses of infantry prepared to receive them, had less tactical effect than at Aspern-Essling, but it did win Napoleon valuable time, allowing him to retake the initiative in this battle.<ref name=Arnold149/>

===Interlude between two campaigns===
[[File:Cuirass holed by a canonball at Waterloo Antoine Favuveau 18Juin 1815.jpg|thumb|200px|A carabinier's [[cuirass]], holed by a [[cannonball]]. This model was adopted in 1810 for both ''Carabiniers-<U+00E0>-Cheval'' regiments, with Nansouty a supporter of the idea.]]
A few days after the battle of Wagram, Napoleon confronted Nansouty over the latter's alleged failure to cooperate with MacDonald. Nansouty responded to the Emperor's lively reproaches by offering categorical explanations, saying that he had not been consulted in the placement of his division, rendering maneuvers impossible during that action. As Napoleon insisted, Nansouty stood up to him, finally retorting: "After all, it is not Your Majesty at any rate who can teach me to lead cavalry..." Despite this remark, Nansouty would continue to be given significant commands in the coming years. It was shortly after this bloody battle that Nansouty insisted that the ''[[Carabiniers-<U+00E0>-Cheval]]'' be given the steel [[cuirass]], in a bid to cancel out what he saw as being a state of inferiority of these troops ''vis-<U+00E0>-vis'' their fellow [[cuirassiers]]. Nansouty's initiative was approved and was enforced in 1810.<ref name="Thoumas, p. 37">Thoumas, p. 37.</ref>

With the [[Treaty of Sch<U+00F6>nbrunn|peace of Vienna]] signed between the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and the [[Austrian Empire]] in October, Nansouty was ordered to leave the command of his division to General [[Jean Pierre Joseph Brugui<U+00E8>re|Bruy<U+00E8>res]] and retake his position of First Squire alongside the Emperor (17 October 1809).<ref name=Thoumas38>Thoumas, p. 38.</ref> However, with the return of the Grand Squire [[Armand Augustin Louis de Caulaincourt]], the role of the First Squire was much diminished. As a result, in 1811 Nansouty was given an additional function, that of General Inspector of cavalry. Very active in exercising this function, he soon became reputed for his strictness and for his detailed knowledge and invaluable experience that he had of this arm. Nonetheless, war was, once more, not far away and on 19 October 1811, Nansouty was called to the command of the 2nd and 4th [[cuirassier]] divisions of the "Observation Corps of the [[Elba]]", under the command of [[Marshal of the Empire|Marshal]] [[Louis Nicolas Davout]]. Then, with the reorganisation of the [[Grande Arm<U+00E9>e]] in April 1812, Nansouty was named at the command of the Ist Corps of cavalry reserve.<ref name=Thoumas38/>

===Campaign in Russia===
With the outbreak of the [[Russian campaign|war with Russia]] in 1812, the Grande Arm<U+00E9>e included, alongside the usual combined-arms Army Corps, four large Cavalry Reserve Corps, commanded respectively by Generals Nansouty (Ist), [[Louis-Pierre Montbrun|Montbrun]] (IInd), [[Emmanuel de Grouchy|Grouchy]] (IIIrd) and [[Marie Victor de Fay, marquis de Latour-Maubourg|La Tour Maubourg]] (IVth Corps). This innovation has been much criticised after this campaign and, in the words of Marshal [[Auguste de Marmont|Marmont]], it had the only merit of "presenting an extraordinary spectacle that astonished the eye."<ref name=Thoumas38/>

During this campaign, Nansouty's Ist Corps was composed of: 
*General [[Jean Pierre Joseph Brugui<U+00E8>re|Bruy<U+00E8>res]]'s 1st light cavalry division (7th, 8th [[hussards]], 16th ''[[Chasseurs <U+00E0> cheval]]'', 9th [[Chevau-l<U+00E9>ger|''Chevau-l<U+00E9>gers lanciers'']], one Prussian and one Polish light horse regiments),
*General [[Antoine Louis Decrest de Saint-Germain|Saint-Germain]]'s 1st cuirassier division (2nd, 3rd, 9th cuirassiers, 1st ''chevau-l<U+00E9>gers lanciers'' regiments),
*General [[Jean-Baptiste Cyrus de Timbrune de Thiembronne|Valence]]'s 5th cuirassier division (6th, 11th and 12th cuirassiers, 5th ''chevau-l<U+00E9>gers lanciers'' regiments),
*an artillery of 36 pieces.<ref name=Thoumas38/>
[[File:Boro2.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Nansouty's cuirassiers attack squares of Russian guardsmen to the left of Semyanovskaya (foreground) during the early stages of the battle of Borodino. Detail from the ''Borodino Panorama'' by [[Franz Roubaud]], 1912.]]
Having crossed the [[Niemen]] river with his Corps, Nansouty would continuously march under the command of [[Joachim Murat]] during this campaign, preceding the advance of the army and taking [[Wilna]] as they advanced. Despite marching constantly alongside Murat and Emperor Napoleon, Nansouty's Ist Corps of cavalry reserve saw little action, combating brilliantly in a [[Vanguard (military formation)|vanguard]] action at [[Battle of Ostrovno|Ostrovno]] and then briefly at [[battle of Vitebsk|Vitebsk]]. An incident involving some of Nansouty's light cavalry occurred during the combat at Vitebsk, when the 8th hussards and 16th ''chasseurs <U+00E0> cheval'' turned and fled before the Russian light horse. This was evidence that the division of Bruy<U+00E8>res, of which they were a part, had been much used by always being placed at the vanguard of the army, resulting in the loss many of the best and bravest troopers. Despite Nansouty's best efforts, the extremely long and exhausting marches, the torrential rains and the absence of proper fodder took their toll on the Ist Cavalry Corps, with numbers reduced to half by this time. Additionally, just like the other Cavalry Corps commanders, Nansouty rarely had all his troops under direct control, which led to cavalry being used improperly at times.<ref>Thoumas, p. 39-40.</ref>

With his three divisions reunited on 7 September 1812, Nansouty's Ist Cavalry Corps saw action at the [[battle of Borodino]]. He was placed on the French right, in second line, behind the Corps of Marshal Davout and, after Murat managed to take the two [[redoubt]]s on the Russian left, Nansouty placed his men on the right of this position and then supported the advance of the right wing of the army. With the Russians making an offensive comeback, Nansouty placed himself at the head of the heavy divisions of Saint-Germain and Valence and charged and while doing so a bullet pierced one of his knees. This was Nansouty's first battle wound and it was serious enough to end his active role during this campaign. He was transported to [[Moscow]] following the battle and there, although still convalescent, he was entrusted with the mission of commanding the convoy that was to take the wounded generals and colonels, as well as the main trophies captured, behind the lines. He was then allowed to return to France and recover from his injury.<ref>Thoumas, p. 39-41.</ref>

===War of the Sixth Coalition===
With the continuation of hostilities in 1813, during the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]], Nansouty was given the prestigious position of [[Colonel General (France)|Colonel-General]] of [[dragoon]]s (16 January), in replacement of General [[Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers]], who had just died of war fatigue and sorrow. Having missed the first part of the campaign, General Nansouty was recalled to a field command once his knee wound was cured, towards mid-1813. He replaced General [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Henri Walther]] at the helm of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Guard]] cavalry, with a complement of 5,000 sabres, and including [[Claude-<U+00C9>tienne Guyot|Guyot]]'s [[Grenadiers <U+00E0> Cheval de la Garde Imp<U+00E9>riale|''Grenadiers-<U+00E0>-cheval'']], [[Louis-Michel Letort de Lorville|Letort]]'s ''Dragons'', [[Charles, comte Lefebvre-Desnouettes|Lefebvre-Desnouettes]] [[Chasseurs <U+00E0> Cheval de la Garde Imp<U+00E9>riale|''Chasseurs-<U+00E0>-cheval'']] and [[Pierre David de Colbert-Chabanais|<U+00C9>douard Colbert]]'s ''Chevau-l<U+00E9>gers lanciers''.<ref name=Thoumas41>Thoumas, p. 41.</ref>

====Campaign in Saxony====
In 1813, most military operations took part in [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]], with the ''Chasseurs-<U+00E0>-cheval'' and [[Pierre David de Colbert-Chabanais|Colbert]]'s ''Chevau-l<U+00E9>gers lanciers'' encountering the enemy in several isolated cavalry actions,<ref name=Thoumas41/> but the first serious action came only at the [[battle of Dresden]], where Nansouty's Guard cavalry supported [[Marshal of the Empire|Marshal]] [[Michel Ney]]'s attack on the extreme left, in conjunction with Marshal [[<U+00C9>douard Adolphe Casimir Joseph Mortier|<U+00C9>douard Mortier]]'s "Young Guard" infantry divisions.<ref>Pigeard, ''Dictionnaire des batailles...'', p. 252.</ref> 
[[File:Feldmarschall F<U+00FC>rst von Wrede.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Bavarian General Karl Philipp von Wrede tried to block Napoleon's retreat back to France, resulting in the [[battle of Hanau]]. The Austro-Bavarian cavalry was defeated by Nansouty's Imperial Guard cavalry.]]
However, the Guard cavalry was not needed as a whole before the epic [[battle of Leipzig|"Battle of Nations" at Leipzig]]. Placed in reserve at first, the Guard cavalry and artillery had to spring into action at once, after Napoleon received news of the Saxon [[defection]]. With the Saxons now in the [[Sixth Coalition|Coalition]] camp and firing at the soldiers who moments before had been their allies, the situation of some of the French troops became desperate. The position of General [[Pierre Fran<U+00E7>ois Joseph Durutte|Durutte]]'s division, placed close to Saxon lines, was particularly tenuous and Napoleon soon came to its aid, with Nansouty in command of the Guard cavalry and horse artillery. Nansouty launched an impetuous charge with a some of his regiments, the ''Grenadiers-<U+00E0>-cheval'', ''Dragons'' and ''Chevau-l<U+00E9>gers'' and the Saxons were unable to hold out in this sector. However, the situation changed on 19 October, with the untimely explosion of a bridge over the [[Elster]], the main retreat line for the French rearguard, which was now blocked in the city of Leipzig. The Guard cavalry extricated itself from the field of battle and was very useful in covering the retreat of the remaining French forces.<ref>Thoumas, p. 42.</ref>

With the [[Grande Arm<U+00E9>e]] in full retreat, another dangerous situation occurred on 29 October. With [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] now also in the camp of the Coalition, an [[Austrian Empire|Austro]]-Bavarian army of some 45,000 men, under General [[Karl Philipp von Wrede]], who had fought under the command of the Emperor during the previous campaigns, tried to block the French retreat and delay the French force until the arrival of the rest of the Coalition forces. Wrede had the means necessary to achieve his goal, as he possessed a numerous artillery of about one hundred pieces and a powerful cavalry of 50 squadrons. In comparison, the French forces were much dispersed and only a few units remained cohesive and combat-capable.<ref>Mir, p. 12.</ref> During the ensuing [[battle of Hanau]], Wrede placed his troops in front of the forest of Lamboi, through which he expected that the French would retreat. He also positioned almost all of his cavalry on the left, placing it under the command of Field Marshal-Lieutenant Spleny. Despite his numeric inferiority, Napoleon sent forward a part of his men against Bavarians deployed in the forest before him, but the intervention of the Foot Guards was soon required. The Bavarians had fought alongside the French in the past and the sight of the fearsome [[Bearskin]]s of French Guardsmen shook their morale and they abandoned their position in the forest after a brief fight. But, with the fire of a Bavarian [[grand battery]] upon them, the French infantry soon had to stop. Napoleon positioned General [[Henri Marie Lenoury|Le Noury]]'s artillery in battery and brought in support General [[Antoine Drouot|Drouot]] with the horse artillery of the Guard, as well as other pieces, constituting a grand battery of some 50 pieces that was soon able to respond adequately to the Austro-Bavarian cannonade. Nansouty, with the Guard Dragoons and Lancers, was instructed to protect this battery from the enemy and thus positioned his men behind the guns.<ref name=Thoumas43>Thoumas, p 43.</ref>
[[File:General Nansouty at the battle of Hanau.jpg|thumb|250px|General Nansouty (his back to the viewer, recognizable due to his powdered hair and ponytail) giving instructions during the defense of the Grand Battery against Austro-Bavarian cavalry. His Guard cavalry is seen charging in the background. Detail of a [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vernet-Battle_of_Hanau.jpg a painting] by [[Horace Vernet]].]]
Seeing this inauspicious development, Wrede sent his cavalry, no less than 7,000 men, to charge Drouot's grand battery. The steady French [[canister shot|canister]] fire was devastating and many Coalition squadrons turned back to safety. Some of them did manage to get to the French guns and crossed the battery, with the Guard cavalry immediately countercharging and driving them off. With the gun line now out of danger, Nansouty, with the aid of [[Horace Fran<U+00E7>ois Bastien S<U+00E9>bastiani de La Porta|Sebastiani]]'s cuirassiers launched a pursuit of the repulsed enemy horse, encountering and breaking an Austrian cuirassier regiment, Knesevich's dragoon regiment and two Bavarian ''chevaulegers'' regiments, all under the personal command of Field Marshal-Lieutenant Spleny. Then, with a maneuver resembling that of [[Fran<U+00E7>ois <U+00C9>tienne de Kellermann|Kellermann]] at [[battle of Marengo|Marengo]], Nansouty wheeled his men left and rushed onto the enemy infantry, breaking them. The ''Grenadiers-<U+00E0>-cheval'' were in the thick of the fighting and, with an offensive comeback of the Bavarian cavalry, they were momentarily in a dangerous situation, but were duly rescued by the Guard ''Gardes d'honneur'' regiment. Nansouty then took his entire cavalry and broke the remaining enemy squares and cavalry, pushing some of these men into the [[Kinzig (Rhine)|Kinzig]] river. Meanwhile, Nansouty's action left Sebastiani free to silence the Bavarian grand battery, skillfully using [[Antoine Louis Decrest de Saint-Germain|Saint-Germain]]'s cuirassier division and [[R<U+00E9>mi Joseph Isidore Exelmans|Exelmans]]'s light division of his Corps.<ref name=Thoumas43-44>Thoumas, p. 43-44.</ref><ref>Mir, p. 16-17.</ref> Nansouty received a light wound during this battle, but his role at Hanau is compared by a Russian author to that of [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz]] at the [[battle of Zorndorf]].<ref name=Thoumas45>Thoumas, p. 45.</ref>

====Campaign in France====
Nansouty's final campaign took place in 1814 on French soil, under bleak circumstances for the French, who saw huge Coalition armies invade France at the beginning of that year. During this campaign, his command, 5,000 Horse Guards, included the [[Polish 1st Light Cavalry Regiment of the Imperial Guard|1st]] and [[2e r<U+00E9>giment de chevau-l<U+00E9>gers lanciers de la Garde Imp<U+00E9>riale|''2nd chevau-l<U+00E9>gers lanciers'']] regiments, under General [[Pierre David de Colbert-Chabanais|<U+00C9>douard Colbert]], the 1st ''chasseurs <U+00E0> cheval'', under General [[Louis-Marie L<U+00E9>vesque de Laferri<U+00E8>re|Laferri<U+00E8>re]], the [[Grenadiers <U+00E0> Cheval de la Garde Imp<U+00E9>riale|''grenadiers <U+00E0> cheval'']] under General [[Claude-<U+00C9>tienne Guyot|Guyot]], the ''Dragons'', under General [[Louis-Michel Letort de Lorville|Letort]], as well as the entire Guard horse artillery.<ref name=Thoumas45>Thoumas, p. 45</ref>

These men soon saw action on 27 January, at the [[battle of Brienne]]. Here, two companies of horse artillery, under an officer called Marin, a veteran of the [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|campaigns in Italy]] and [[French Campaign in Egypt and Syria|Egypt]] and personal favorite of the Emperor, were almost completely destroyed, with their guns and commander captured by the enemy. Napoleon was extremely irritated about the failure of the [[heavy cavalry]] of the Guard to protect these gunners. A further loss of cannons of the Guard artillery occurred at the [[battle of La Rothi<U+00E8>re]], a rare battlefield defeat for Napoleon. Here, a part of the Guard cavalry charged and was initially successful against enemy cavalry but, faced by steady ranks of the [[Imperial Guard (Russia)|Russian]] and Prussian Guardsmen and with its flank threatened by enemy [[dragoon]]s, it soon had to withdraw, leaving behind some of its cannons.<ref name=Thoumas45/>

After rejoining the Emperor at [[Champaubert]], Nansouty took part to the [[battle of Montmirail]], where he was at first instructed to protect the artillery. He then joined in the attack of the Guard infantry on the farm of <U+0116>pine-au-Bois, where he suddenly turned left and fell upon unprepared enemy infantry, charging home and routing these troops, subsequently pursuing the fugitives. This combined attack of the Guard resulted in a great number of prisoners and captured enemy guns, with Nansouty receiving a light wound in the process. A part of his men then took part to the [[Battle of Ch<U+00E2>teau-Thierry (1814)|battle of Ch<U+00E2>teau-Thierry]], where the Emperor ordered the Guard cavalry to make a turning move against the enemy left, and where Nansouty's subordinates General Letort and Colonel [[Jean-Nicolas Cur<U+00E9>ly|Cur<U+00E9>ly]] brilliantly broke several enemy squares. Then, on 14 February, Nansouty personally led a brilliant charge at the [[battle of Vauchamps]], where he supported [[Emmanuel de Grouchy|Grouchy]] in a cavalry action that decided the battle. Charging [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl<U+00FC>cher|Bl<U+00FC>cher]]'s men from the front, Nansouty allowed Grouchy to magnificently fall behind the enemy columns, which they both then sabred and crushed, with the Guard cavalry subsequently participating to a highly successful pursuit. Enemy losses reached a staggering 9,000-10,000 casualties, with 25 cannons lost. The Emperor was radiant following this battle, but, by nightfall, his mood changed when he found out of the loss of some Guard horse artillerymen. These men had been captured during their march and it was reported that their capture resulted from General Guyot (one of Nansouty's subordinates) failing to provide an escort and a guide for them. In Nansouty's presence, a fuming Napoleon summoned Guyot and then chastised him for the repeated losses in cannons during the previous battles, as well as for various other shortcomings, such as failing to properly escort the Emperor. After an angry tirade, Napoleon promptly axed Guyot and announced Nansouty that General [[R<U+00E9>mi Joseph Isidore Exelmans|Exelmans]] would replace Guyot at the helm of his Old Guard heavy cavalry. This episode apparently strained relations between Emperor Napoleon and General Nansouty.<ref>Thoumas, p. 46-51.</ref>
[[File:Meissonier - 1814, Campagne de France.jpg|thumb|250px|Napoleon in campaign during the 1814 military operations in France. Painting by [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier]].]]
Always in the thick of the action during this campaign, on 24 February, Nansouty was present near the city of [[Troyes]]. Negotiations for an [[armistice]] were ongoing in a village nearby and, despite formal orders to continue the fighting, the two armies had ceased the combat. Nansouty then took his men and attacked enemy troops, charging into the streets of the village where the negotiations were taking place. The French envoy to the armistice talks, [[Charles Joseph, comte de Flahaut|Monsieur de Flahaut]] saw this development and found Nansouty, bitterly protesting against the latter's action. Nansouty responded that the Emperor was doubtlessly aware that negotiations were indeed taking place there, but that he had orders to capture the position without further delay. On 27 February, the Emperor again moved against Bl<U+00FC>cher's Prussians, leaving a part of his forces near Troyes to observe the movement of [[Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg|Prince of Schwarzenberg]]'s Austrian army. Nansouty, with the Guard cavalry, accompanied the Emperor, ensuring his protection and clearing his way after a bloody cavalry skirmish at Ch<U+00E2>teau-Thierry on 3 March. Another cavalry skirmish occurred on 5 March, with Nansouty repulsing a numerous enemy cavalry, 3,000-4,000 troopers, and capturing the bridge of [[Berry-au-Bac]], over the [[Aisne (river)|Aisne]], despite the enemy cannonade. Once across the Aisne with a few Polish lancer [[platoons]], Nansouty launched a heroic pursuit, capturing enemy cannons and munitions, and taking a significant number of prisoners, among whom was the teenage Russian Prince Gagarine.<ref name=Thoumas52-56>Thoumas, p. 52-56.</ref>

On 7 March, at the [[battle of Craonne]], another incident occurred, seemingly indicating that there had been some sort of disagreement between the General and the Emperor. As the battle was raging, General [[Augustin Daniel Belliard|Belliard]] from the Emperor's staff, came to Nansouty and told him that he had orders to relieve him of command, should his health prevent him from exercising his duties. Nansouty responded that he was indeed ill, but that he was able to retrain command. Although in unusually and noted bad humour after this incident, Nansouty subsequently led a most brilliant action at Craonne. He was ordered to cross bogged and broken terrain, climb a steep incline, with his cavalry and artillery, in order to fall on the enemy's right flank. Managing to bring his cavalrymen on the ridge, Nansouty formed them in line formation and launched them against the enemy, pushing back in disorder two Russian battalions. Nansouty was again wounded during this action, but this injury was not very serious and he continued to energetically lead the pursuit of the Coalition forces. This was to be the last military engagement of his long career. On 8 March, on the eve of the [[battle of Laon]], Nansouty was at [[Chavignon]], nine kilometers from [[Laon]], where the Emperor was also present and, although the circumstances of Nansouty's departure are unclear, it is certain that he left this village, and his command, that very day. Two days later, Napoleon wrote to his War Minister to inform him that General Nansouty's health did not allow him to exercise his military duties and that he was authorised to take sick leave in Paris. General Belliard had taken interim command of the Guard cavalry during the battle of Laon, with General [[Horace Fran<U+00E7>ois Bastien S<U+00E9>bastiani de La Porta|S<U+00E9>bastiani]] subsequently given permanent command.<ref name=Thoumas52-56/>

==Bourbon Restoration==
[[File:Etienne-Marie-Champion de Nansouty.JPG|thumb|200px|left|General Nansouty portrayed as Colonel-General of Dragoons, a position he held between January 1813 and until the [[Bourbon Restoration]].]]
Having left his command to General [[Augustin Daniel Belliard|Belliard]] on 8 March, three days later, Nansouty was a part of a convoy of several officers, heading to Paris. On the road to the capital, they were attacked by a ''pulk'' of cossacks, which managed to disperse the convoy's escort. Nansouty and his officers fought their way out sabre in hand and made a run for it towards the [[Aisne (river)|river Aisne]]. Reaching the riverbanks, the General got isolated and, as he was preparing to cross the river on horseback, his horse was shot under him, throwing the General to the ground. Nevertheless, he stood up and swam to the other bank of the river and safety. This event, as well as his tireless activity during the campaign, seem to suggest that his health was not the main reason of his departure from the army. It is also unlikely that the Emperor himself decided to replace him, given Belliard's tentative approach at the [[battle of Craonne]] and this General's subsequent provisional status as commander, after Nansouty's departure. It is thus more likely that Nansouty resigned, following his disputes with the Emperor.<ref>Thoumas, p. 56.</ref> 

General Nansouty arrived in Paris and there he remained during the [[Bourbon Restoration]] that followed Napoleon's abdication. He was one of the first general officers to swear allegiance to the new [[King of France]], [[Louis XVIII]], who would bestow a number of honours upon the General. On 12  April 1814, Nansouty was named extraordinary commissioner of the King in the 2nd military division, then, on 20 April, became a member of the commission that was in charge of the dissolution of Napoleon's [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]]. He was given the distinction of Knight of the [[Order of Saint Louis]] on 1 June and on 6 July he was called to a command in the [[Maison militaire du roi de France|Military Household of the King of France]], as captain-lieutenant of the 1st company of [[Musketeers of the Guard|musketeers]] (grey musketeers). Despite these positions, Nansouty's financial situation declined severely under the Restoration. The General had had a highly honourable behaviour during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and, unlike some of his fellow Napoleonic Generals, had drawn no revenues from [[pillaging]]. He had also been living a lofty and very costly lifestyle, which he considered normal for a nobleman such as himself. Nansouty had been earning a high revenue from his various positions during the [[First French Empire|Empire]] and additionally Napoleon was constantly paying high [[Financial endowment|endowments]] to his best generals. Napoleonic endowments aside, Nansouty's salaries during the first four months of 1814 had brought him no less than 104,000 Francs, but, under the Bourbons, his dignity as [[Colonel General (France)|Colonel-General]] of dragoons had been suppressed and transformed into a honorific title of Inspector of dragoons, leaving him with only a 25,000 Francs salary as captain-lieutenant in the King's Military Household.<ref name=Thoumas57>Thoumas, p. 57.</ref>

==Death and resting place==
By the second half of 1814, following his long and almost continuous campaigns throughout Europe during the last ten years, the health of General Nansouty badly deteriorated. He was suffering from his wounds, some of which were very recent, but, above all from war fatigue. General Count <U+00C9>tienne-Marie-Antoine-Champion de Nansouty died on 12 February 1815 in [[Paris]], leaving behind his wife and their only son.

==Family==
General Count de Nansouty was the first child of Jean-Baptiste-Pierre-Charles Champion de Nansouty (born 1718 in [[Dijon]]) and his wife  Antoinette H<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>ne Harpailler (born ca. 1740), who also had Pierrette-Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de Champion de Nansouty (1771<U+2013>1849).<ref name=GeneaNet>[http://gw1.geneanet.org/index.php3?b=garric&lang=fr;p=etienne;n=champion+de+nansouty;oc=1 GeneaNet]</ref> On 27 September 1802, General Nansouty married Jeanne-Francoise Adelaide Gravier de Vergennes,<ref name=Thoumas57/> born in 1781, deceased in 1849 (Parents: Charles Xavier Gravier de Vergennes, 1751<U+2013>1794, and Elisabeth Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de Fran<U+00E7>oise de Bastard, 1763<U+2013>1808) and the couple had only one child, Etienne Champion de Nansouty (1803<U+2013>1865),<ref name=GeneaNet/> who, having followed his father's and grandfather's footsteps in the military, rose to the rank of squadron commander, but then resigned from the army.<ref name=Thoumas57/> General Count Nansouty also had a nephew, [[Charles-Etienne Champion de Nansouty]], who saw a successful military career and who later rose to the rank of general of division.<ref name=Thoumas57/>

==Considerations==
Nansouty is reported to have been a man of spirit but also to have had an excessive inclination towards sarcasm, which was damaging to his reputation and made him a number of enemies. His few months spent in Spain in 1808, where he commanded the orderly officers of the Emperor and the ''aides-de-camp'' of the senior generals of the [[General Staff]], seem to have acquired him an unwanted reputation for mockery on the service, to such a point that one of his subordinates reported that "no one ever knew when he was joking and when he was serious." When it came to military matters though, Nansouty's posture became extremely imposing, concise and tough. A perfectionist, with a keen eye and impeccable knowledge of his arm, he was shocked whenever he saw his cavalry maneuvers mishandled and then he became sarcastic, at times even insulting with his subordinates. However, whenever he went too far with his reprimands, he was noticeably displeased with himself and remorseful, trying to offer reparation to the person he had insulted. This behaviour seems to have been recurrent.<ref name=Thoumas28-29>Thoumas, p. 28-29.</ref> 
[[File:Nansouty at Friedland.jpg|200px|thumb|General Nansouty depicted in [[Horace Vernet]]'s painting "Napoleon at Friedland".]]
His mood seems to have been particularly bad during his last days of service, having received a number of light wounds in a short period of time, and foremost, after he had fallen out with the Emperor. During this period, he severely mistreated one of his squadron commanders for not executing his order fast enough, and even sacked his chief of staff, Colonel de la Loy<U+00E8>re, for a minor fault.<ref name=Thoumas52-56/> Indeed, at times, his sarcasm was directed at his superiors, with Nansouty clashing with [[Emmanuel de Grouchy|Grouchy]] at the [[battle of Friedland]]. Nevertheless, Grouchy later recognised that the actions of Nansouty's division throughout the battle were "glorious".<ref name=Thoumas25>Thoumas, p. 25.</ref> In 1809, Nansouty famously responded to Napoleon's criticism after the [[battle of Wagram]] by saying: "It is not You Majesty at any rate who can teach me how to handle cavalry."<ref name="Thoumas, p. 37"/> Three years later, during the [[Russian campaign|campaign in Russia]], when [[Joachim Murat|Murat, King of Naples]] complained to him about the lack of resistance of the horses, Nansouty retorted: "Oh yes, Sire, this is because they lack patriotism."<ref>Thoumas, p. 39.</ref>

Overall as a [[heavy cavalry]] commander, Nansouty was one of the best men available during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Precise, methodic, with perfect knowledge of cavalry tactics, he was better than any other in preparing his attack dispositions. He was however less daring than the likes of [[Antoine Lasalle|Lasalle]], [[Louis-Pierre Montbrun|Montbrun]] or [[Francois Etienne de Kellermann|Kellermann]], which did not prevent him from leading some of the most memorable cavalry charges of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref>Thoumas, p. 13.</ref> It has also been said that he reacted with "calculated slowness" when placed under the command of Murat.<ref name=Thoumas25/> His talents for up-keeping and training his troops seemed to surpass that of his peers. This was illustrated right from the start of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], with the organisation of the cavalry reserve in the [[Grande Arm<U+00E9>e]], under [[Marshal of the Empire|Marshal]] Murat. The command of the various units of this reserve was given to some of the best cavalry commanders available, including [[Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul]], [[Louis Klein]], [[Marc Antoine de Beaumont]], [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Henri Walther]], [[Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers]] and [[<U+00C9>douard Jean Baptiste Milhaud]]. Despite the fame and quality of these commanders, it was Nansouty's six-regiment division that acquired the reputation of being the best serviced and most exact in its maneuvers.<ref name=Thoumas18/>

Nansouty's battlefield talents were demonstrated through superb charges at [[battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]], [[Battle of Eckm<U+00FC>hl|Eckm<U+00FC>hl]], [[Battle of Aspern-Essling|Essling]], [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]], [[Battle of Hanau|Hanau]], [[Battle of Montmirail|Montmirail]], [[Battle of Vauchamps|Vauchamps]] or [[Battle of Craonne|Craonne]], thus contributing to some of the most glorious victories of the French Empire and eliciting comparisons with the superb [[Prussia]]n cavalry commander [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz]].<ref>Thoumas, p. 58.</ref>
