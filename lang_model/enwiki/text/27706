The '''Boeing E-3 Sentry''' is an [[airborne warning and control system]] (AWACS) developed by [[Boeing Defense, Space & Security|Boeing]] as the prime contractor. Derived from the [[Boeing 707]], it provides all-weather surveillance, command, control and communications, and is used by the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF), [[NATO]], [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), [[French Air Force]] and [[Royal Saudi Air Force]]. The E-3 is distinguished by the distinctive rotating radar dome above the fuselage. Production ended in 1992 after 68 aircraft were built.

In the mid-1960s, the USAF was seeking an aircraft to replace its piston-engined [[EC-121]], which had seen service for over a decade. After issuing preliminary development contracts to three companies, the USAF picked Boeing to construct two airframes to test Westinghouse Electric's and [[Hughes Aircraft|Hughes]]'s competing radars. Both radars used [[pulse-Doppler radar|pulse-Doppler technology]], with Westinghouse's design emerging as the contract winner. Testing on the first production E-3 began in October&nbsp;1975.

The first USAF E-3 was delivered in March&nbsp;1977, and during the next seven years, a total of 34 aircraft were manufactured. NATO, as a single identity, also had eighteen aircraft manufactured, basing them in [[Germany]]. The E-3 was also sold to the [[United Kingdom]] (seven) and [[France]] (four) and [[Saudi Arabia]] (five, plus eight E-3 derived tanker aircraft). In 1991, by which time the last aircraft was delivered, E-3s participated in [[Operation Desert Storm]], playing a crucial role of directing [[Coalition of the Gulf War|Coalition]] aircraft against the enemy. Throughout the aircraft's service life, numerous upgrades were performed to enhance its capabilities. In 1996, Westinghouse Electric was acquired by Northrop before being renamed ''[[Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems]]'', which currently supports the E-3's radar.

== Development ==
=== Background ===
In 1963, the USAF asked for proposals for an AWACS to replace its [[Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star|EC-121 Warning Stars]], which had served in the [[airborne early warning]] role for over a decade.<ref>Wilson 1998, p.&nbsp;72.</ref> The new aircraft would take advantage of improvements in radar technology which allowed airborne radars to "look down" and detect low-flying aircraft, even over land, which was previously impractical due to [[Radar#Clutter|ground clutter]].<ref name=Eden_p92>Eden et al 2004, p.&nbsp;92.</ref> Contracts were issued to Boeing, [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]] and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], the latter being eliminated in July&nbsp;1966. In 1967, a parallel program was put into place to develop the radar, with [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] and the [[Hughes Aircraft]] being asked to compete in producing the radar system. In 1968 it was referred to as Overland Radar Technology (ORT) during development tests on the modified EC-121Q.<ref name="AUR1">{{cite web|url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1972/may-jun/pearce.html |title=AWACS to Bridge the Technological Gap |accessdate=14 February 2009 |publisher=Air University }}</ref><ref name="Davies p2">Davies 2005, p.&nbsp;2.</ref> The Westinghouse's radar antenna was going to be used whichever company won the radar competition, since Westinghouse had pioneered in the design of high-power RF phase-shifters.

[[File:Lockheed RC-121C 1955.jpg|thumb|left|The piston-engined [[Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star|EC-121 Warning Star]], a military development of the [[Lockheed Constellation]], saw service since the mid-1950s.|alt=Black-and-white photograph of piston-engined aircraft with a large hump on mid-fuselage.]]

Boeing initially proposed a purpose-built aircraft, but tests indicated that it would not outperform the already-operational 707, so the latter was chosen instead. To increase endurance, this design was to be powered by eight [[General Electric TF34]]s, or carrying its radar in a rotating dome mounted at the top of a forward-swept tail, above the fuselage.<ref name=Eden_p92/><ref>{{Cite web|first=Erik|last= Simonsen|url=http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2007/march/i_history.pdf|title=Still keeping watch|date=March 2007|publisher=Boeing|format=PDF|accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref> Boeing was selected ahead of [[McDonnell Douglas]]'s [[Douglas DC-8|DC-8]]-based proposal in July&nbsp;1970. Initial orders were placed for two aircraft, designated ''EC-137D'' as test beds to evaluate the two competing radars. As the test-beds did not need the same 14-hour endurance demanded of the production aircraft, the EC-137s retained the [[Pratt & Whitney JT3D]] commercial engines, and a later reduction in endurance requirement led to retaining the normal engines in production.<ref name=Davies_p2/> 

The first EC-137 made its maiden flight on 9&nbsp;February&nbsp;1972, with the fly-off between the two radars taking place during March<U+2013>July that year.<ref name=AUR1/> Favorable test results saw the selection of Westinghouse's radar for the production aircraft.<ref name="Davies 5-6">Davies 2005, pp.&nbsp;5<U+2013>6.</ref> Hughes's radar was initially thought to be a certain winner, simply because much of its design was also going into the new [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15 Eagle]]'s radar program. The Westinghouse radar used a pipelined [[Fast Fourier Transform]] (FFT) to digitally-resolve 128 Doppler frequencies, while Hughes's radars used analog filters based on the design for the F-15 fighter. Westinghouse's engineering team won this competition by having a programmable 18-[[bit]] computer whose software could be modified before each mission, and for multiplexing a Beyond The Horizon (BTH) mode that could complement the [[pulse-Doppler radar]] mode. This proved to be beneficial especially when the BTH mode is used to detect ships at sea when the radar beam is directed below the horizon.<ref name="Northrop1">{{cite web|url=http://www.es.northropgrumman.com/solutions/awacs/assets/AWACS.pdf |title=AWACS Surveillance Radar |accessdate=10 February 2009 |publisher=Northrop Grumman|format=PDF }}</ref>

=== Full-scale development ===
Approval was given on 26&nbsp;January&nbsp;1973 for full-scale development of the AWACS system. To allow further development of the aircraft's systems, orders were placed for three pre-production aircraft, the first of which performed its maiden flight in February&nbsp;1975. To save costs, the endurance requirements were relaxed allowing the new aircraft to retain the four JT3D (US Military designation TF33) engines.<ref name=Davies_p2/><ref name="Janes 76 p246">Taylor et al 1976, p.&nbsp;246.</ref> IBM and Hazeltine were selected to develop the mission computer and display system. The IBM computer receiving the designation 4PI, and the software is written in [[JOVIAL]]. A [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment]] (SAGE) or BUIC operator would immediately be at home with the track displays and tabular displays, but differences in symbology would create compatibility problems in tactical ground radar systems in [[Iceland]], Europe and Korea over [[MIL-STD-6011|Link-11 (TADIL-A)]].

A contingent of people are there to welcome the jet, which has a disc-shaped radar perching on top of struts on the dorsal fuselage.]]

Modifications to the Boeing 707 for the E-3 Sentry included a rotating radar dome, single-point ground refueling, air refueling, and a bail-out chute. The original design called for two bail-out chutes (one forward, and one aft) but the aft bail-out chute was deleted as a way to cut mounting costs.<ref name="Cresent1">{{cite book|author=[[Bill Gunston|Gunston, Bill]]|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of the World's Modern Military Aircraft |year=1985|publisher=Leisure Books|isbn= 978-0-517-22477-9}}</ref> Engineering, test and evaluation began on the first E-3 Sentry in October&nbsp;1975. During 1977<U+2013>1992, a total of 68 E-3s were built.<ref name=USAF1/><ref name = Boeing1/>

=== Future status ===
Because the Boeing 707 is no longer in production, the E-3 mission package has been fitted into the [[Boeing E-767]] for the [[Japan Air Self Defense Force]]s. The [[Northrop Grumman E-10 MC2A|E-10 MC2A]] was intended to replace USAF E-3s<U+2014>along with the [[Boeing RC-135|RC-135]] and the E-8<U+2014>but the E-10 program was canceled by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. The USAF is now performing a series of incremental improvements, mainly to avionics, to bring the E-3 up to current standards of performance. Boeing is flight testing its Block 40/45 E-3s. This modified E-3 contains upgrades of the mission crew and air battle management sections, as well as significantly-upgraded electronic equipment.<ref>{{Cite press release|url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/asw_isr/news/2008/q3/080910a_nr.html|title=Completes Mission System Flight Testing for US AWACS Block 40/45 Upgrade|publisher=Boeing|date=10 September 2008|accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref>

Another program that the Air Force is considering is the "Avionics Modernization Program" (AMP). AMP would equip the E-3s with [[glass cockpit]]s. The Air Force also wants modified E-3s with jet engines that are more reliable than the original ones, and also with at least 19% higher fuel efficiencies. New turbofan engines would give these E-3s longer ranges, longer time-on-station, and a shorter critical runway length. If the modification is carried out, the E-3s could take off with full fuel loads using runways only {{convert|10000|ft|m}} long, and also at higher [[ambient temperature]]s and lower [[barometric pressure]]s, such as from bases in mountainous areas. Now that the [[E-8 Joint STARS]] is being fitted with the new [[Pratt & Whitney JT8D|Pratt & Whitney JT8D-219]] turbofans, which are stated as having one-half the cost of the competing engine, the [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56]], the Air Force is again studying the possibility of replacing the E-3's original turbofan engines with more-efficient ones.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-76547425.html|title=EADS, Northrop Grumman, Partt and Whitney To Offer NATO AWACS Upgrade|work=Defense Daily International|date=13 July 2001|accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref>

== Design ==
=== Overview ===
{{See also|Boeing 707#Design}}
The E-3 Sentry's airframe is a modified [[Boeing 707|Boeing 707-320B Advanced]] model. USAF and NATO E-3s have an unrefueled range of some {{convert|4000|mi|km|abbr=on}} or eight hours' of flying.<ref name=GS.org_specs/> The newer E-3 versions bought by France, Saudi Arabia and the UK are equipped with newer CFM56-2 turbofan engines, and these can fly for about 11 hours or about {{convert|5000|mi|km|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Boeing E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS)|publisher=Boeing|url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/ic/awacs/docs/E-3AWACS_overview.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=22 August 2011}}</ref> The Sentry's range and on-station time can be increased through [[air-to-air refueling]] and the crews can work in shifts by the use of an on-board crew rest and meals area.<ref name=USAF1/><ref name=Boeing1/>
[[File:ILA 2008 PD 185.JPG|thumb|left|Close-up view of the radar, which revolves at 6 [[revolutions per minute]].<ref>Wilson 1998, p.&nbsp;73.</ref>|alt=Close-up view of black disc-shaped radar with wide diagonal white band. The radar rests on two convergent struts above aircraft fuselage.]]

The unpressurized dome is 30&nbsp;feet (9.1&nbsp;m) in diameter, six feet (1.8&nbsp;m) thick at the center, and is held 11&nbsp;feet (3.4&nbsp;m) above the fuselage by two struts.<ref name=USAF1/> It is tilted down 6<U+00B0> at the front to reduce its air drag during take-offs, and while flying endurance speed (which is corrected electronically by both the radar and SSR antenna phase shifters). The dome uses both bleed-air and cooling doors to remove the heat generated by electronic and mechanical equipment. The hydraulically-rotated antenna system permits the [[Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems|Westinghouse Corporation]]'s AN/APY-1 and AN/APY-2 [[passive electronically scanned array]] radar system<ref name="GS">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/e-3.htm |title=E-3 Sentry (AWACS) |accessdate=9 November 2009 |work=[[Globalsecurity.org]] }}</ref> to provide surveillance from the Earth's surface up into the [[stratosphere]], over land or water.

Other major subsystems in the E-3 Sentry are navigation, communications, and computers. Consoles display computer-processed data in graphic and tabular format on video screens. Console operators perform surveillance, identification, weapons control, battle management and communications functions.<ref name=USAF1/> The radar and computer subsystems on the E-3 can gather and present broad and detailed battlefield information. This includes position and tracking information on enemy aircraft and ships, and location and status of friendly aircraft and naval vessels. The information can be sent to major command and control centers in rear areas or aboard ships. In times of crisis, data can be forwarded to the [[National Command Authority]] in the U.S. via [[RC-135]] or naval [[aircraft carrier]] task forces.<ref name=USAF1/>

[[Electrical generator]]s mounted on each of the E-3's four engines provide one megawatt of electrical power that is required by the E-3's radars and other electronics.<ref name=USAF1/> Its [[pulse-Doppler radar]] has a range of more than 250&nbsp;mi (400&nbsp;km) for low-flying targets at its operating altitude, and the pulse  "beyond the horizon" radar has a range of approximately 400&nbsp;mi (650&nbsp;km) for aircraft flying at medium to high altitudes. The radar combined with a [[secondary surveillance radar]] to provide a look down to detect, identify and track enemy and friendly low-flying aircraft while eliminating ground clutter returns.<ref name=USAF1/><ref name="Boeing1">{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/ic/awacs/index.html |title= Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) |accessdate=26 May 2007 |publisher=Boeing }}</ref><ref name="FAS1">{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/man/uswpns/air/special/e3.html |title=E-3 Sentry (AWACS) |accessdate=13 July 2011 |date=23 April 2000 |work=[[Federation of American Scientists]]}}</ref>

In support of air-to-ground operations, the E-3 can provide direct information needed for interdiction, reconnaissance, airlift and close-air support for friendly ground forces. It can also provide information for commanders of air operations to gain and maintain control of the air battle, whilst as an air defense asset, E-3s can detect, identify and track airborne enemy forces far from the boundaries of the U.S. or NATO countries and can direct fighter-interceptor aircraft to these targets.<ref name=USAF1/>

=== Upgrades ===
After being introduced into USAF service, E-3s "Block 30/35 Modification Program", an extensive upgrade program aimed at vastly enhancing the E-3's capabilities. This upgrade started in May&nbsp;1987, and ended on 30&nbsp;October&nbsp;2001, when the 32nd and last upgraded airframe was rolled out.<ref name="GS1">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/e-3-30.htm |title=E-3 Sentry (AWACS) |accessdate=26 May 2007 |work=[[Globalsecurity.org]] }}</ref> The first of four enhancements was the installation of [[Electronic warfare support measures|electronic support measures]] (ESM) for passive detection, an electronic surveillance capability to detect and identify air and surface-based emitters. Secondly, the [[Joint Tactical Information Distribution System]] (JTIDS) was included to provide secure, anti-jam communication for information distribution, position location and identification capabilities. This system enhanced [[MIL-STD-6011|TADIL-A Link-11]] with a high speed exchange of radar information. System also known as TADIL-J, or Link-16. The project also increased the memory capability in the computer to accommodate JTIDS (Link-16), ESM and future enhancements. The last addition was the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS).<ref name=GS1/>

The Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) was a joint US/NATO development program.<ref name=USAF1/> RSIP enhances the operational capability of the E-3 radars' [[electronic countermeasures]], and dramatically improve the system's reliability, maintainability, and availability.<ref name=USAF1/> Essentially, this program replaced the older [[transistor-transistor logic]] (TTL) and [[emitter-coupled logic]] (MECL) electronic logic components that were no longer even being manufactured, with off-the-shelf [[digital computer]]s. These computers being programmed in a high-level language instead of in [[assembly language]]. The real improvements came from replacing the old 8-bit FFT with 24-bit FFTs, and the 12-bit A/D (Sign + 12-bits) with a 15-bit A/D (Sign + 15-bits).<ref name=Northrop1/> These hardware and software modifications improve the E-3 radars' performance, and they provide enhanced detection with emphasis towards low [[radar cross-section]] (RCS) targets.<ref name=USAF1/>

The RAF had also joined the USAF in adding RSIP to upgrade the E-3's radars. The retrofitting of the E-3 squadrons were completed in December&nbsp;2000. Along with the RSIP upgrade was installation of the Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation Systems which dramatically improve positioning accuracy. In 2002, Boeing was awarded a contract to add RSIP to the small French AWACS squadron. Installation was completed in 2006.<ref name=USAF1/><ref name=Boeing3>{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/ic/awacs/e3svcww/ukfr.html |title= AWACS For United Kingdom and France |accessdate=26 May 2007 |publisher=Boeing }}</ref>

== Operational history ==
In March&nbsp;1977 the 552nd Airborne Warning and Control Wing (now the [[552d Air Control Wing]]) at [[Tinker AFB]], [[Oklahoma]] received the first E-3 aircraft.<ref name=USAF1/> The 34th and last USAF Sentry was delivered in June&nbsp;1984.<ref name=Boeing_AWACS>{{Cite web|title=U.S. and NATO AWACS|publisher=Boeing|url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/ic/awacs/e3svcww/usnato.html|accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref> In March 1996, the USAF activated the [[513th Air Control Group]] (513 ACG), an ACC-gained [[Air Force Reserve Command]] (AFRC) AWACS unit under the Reserve Associate Program. Collocated with the 552 ACW at Tinker AFB, the 513 ACG which performs similar duties on active duty E-3 aircraft shared with the 552 ACW.<ref name=USAF1/>

The USAF have a total of thirty-two E-3s in active service. Twenty-seven are stationed at Tinker AFB and belong to the [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC). Four are assigned to the [[Pacific Air Forces]] (PACAF) and stationed at [[Kadena AB]], Okinawa and [[Elmendorf AFB]], Alaska. One aircraft (TS-3) is assigned to Boeing for testing and development.<ref name=USAF1/>

NATO acquired 18 E-3As and support equipment for a NATO air defense force. Since all aircraft must be registered with a certain country, the decision was made to register the 18 NATO Sentries with [[Luxembourg]], a NATO member that previously did not had any air force. The first NATO E-3 was delivered in January&nbsp;1982.<ref name=Wilson_p75>Wilson 1998, p&nbsp;75.</ref> The eighteen E-3s were operated by Number 1, 2 and 3 Squadrons of NATO's E-3 Component, based at [[NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen]].<ref name=Wilson_p75/> Presently 17 NATO E-3As are in the inventory, since one E-3 was lost in a crash.<ref name=Boeing_AWACS/><ref name=Flight1997/>
