An '''''Amsterdammertje''''' is the typical [[red]]-[[brown]] [[steel]] [[bollard]] that is used to separate the [[sidewalk]] from the [[street]] in [[Amsterdam]]. ''Amsterdammertje'' means literally 'little one from Amsterdam' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. The bollards have the three [[saltire|Saint Andrew's Cross]]es from the [[coat of arms of Amsterdam]].
__TOC__
==History==
Around [[1800]], more and more individual people in Amsterdam started to use bollards to protect the [[sidewalk]] in front of their houses. These bollards were made of [[metal]] (of old [[cannon]]s), [[stone]], or [[wood]]. In the late [[19th century]] the first [[cast iron]] bollards were made. From [[1915]] onwards there was a standard bollard of 70 [[kilogram|kg]] cast iron with three Saint Andrew's Crosses from the coat of arms of Amsterdam. This bollard already looked like the modern ''Amsterdammertje'', although, amongst other differences, it was thinner and heavier.<ref name="amsterdam">{{cite web

From [[1972]] the Amsterdammertjes were no longer made from the expensive and heavy cast iron, but from plates of [[steel]], approximately 1.35[[metre|m]] high<ref name="vvv">{{cite web

==Current policy==
Because of [[truck]]s pushing over the bollards and smaller cars passing between the bollards, the use of ''Amsterdammertjes'' was no longer a sufficient method to prevent cars from parking on the sidewalks. During the [[2000s]], the sidewalks in Amsterdam will be slightly elevated from the streets, meaning that the ''Amsterdammertjes'' are no longer needed to separate the sidewalk from the street. Yearly, around 2,000 ''Amsterdammertjes'' will be removed until they are all gone. In 2003, there were 37,616 ''Amsterdammertjes'' left.<ref name="amsterdam"/>

New and used ''Amsterdammertjes'' are sold online by the city government of Amsterdam.<ref>{{cite web
