==Artist==

Raab comes from a family involved in creative enterprises. His mother was a landscape artist and an acquaintance of [[Frederick Varley|Frederick Varley (1881-1969)]] from Canada<U+2018>s [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]]. Raab<U+2018>s uncle, Ernest Raab was a sculptor of [[Jewish art#Visual arts and architecture|Jewish art]] and created bronze sculptures and glass alters for synagogues and memorial sites, such as the Holocaust Memorial in Earl Bales Park Toronto, Canada.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gasner|first=Cynthia|title=Obit: artist Ernest Raab (died 2003)|url=http://www.billgladstone.ca/?p=6618|work=Bill Gladstone|accessdate=20 June 2013}}</ref>  Raab<U+2018>s aunts were fashion designers and his father Alexandre, was a rose hybridizer and the author of <U+201C>The Manifesto of Entrepreneurial Democracies<U+201C>.<ref>Metz, Robert (1990). [http://www.freedomparty.on.ca/freedomflyer/ff16_15.htm "Book Review: The Manifesto of Entrepreneurial Democracy"]. ''Freedom Party of Ontario''. Retrieved 15 July 2013.</ref>

As a scientist and engineer, Raab claims to bring his technical training in materials to bear on his art: 

''<U+201C>My art is the result of my many years working in science and physics, encompassing a career focused on 3D measurement devices. [...] Parleau is about realizations. I realize that when I try to control, I control less. I realize that every time I try to color inside the lines that the color leaks out. I realize that understanding begins by admitting I don<U+2018>t understand. In physics, the uncertainty principle embodies the resistance to precision. The art begins formalized, boundary-delimited and planar, and then begins to quickly escape and deform and seek other dimensions.<U+201C>'' <ref>{{cite book|last=Raab|first=Simon|title=Artist's Statement: Simon Raab - Parleau|year=2010|publisher=Galerie Peter Zimmermann|location=Mannheim, Germany|isbn=978-3-9808352-8-2|page=118|url=http://simonraabgallery.com/Simon_Raab/Parleau_2010/}}</ref> 
==Parleau==
Raab works in a new medium, he calls and patented as "Parleau" ("Parleaux" in the plural) which is French for 'through the water'.<ref name=":0" /> The term suggests the quality of light passing through liquid. He uses large-format sheets of metal (aluminum or stainless steel) which he paints first and then forms and sculpts by hand. He creates wall-mounted paintings with embedded frames and freestanding volumetric sculptures.
