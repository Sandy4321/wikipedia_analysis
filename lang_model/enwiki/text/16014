The '''Gorgol River''' is a [[river]] of southern [[Mauritania]]. Located in the south flowing through the [[Gorgol]] valley, it is a [[tributary]] of the [[Senegal]] river.

The river basin plays an important in role in [[Economy of Mauritania|Mauritanian economy]] facilated by investment in the [[1970s]]. The Mauritanian government initiated an [[irrigation]] and development scheme in 1975 for the [[Gorgol River]] valley where the dam across the Gorgol would increase [[arable land]] by over 3,600 ha (9,000 acres). This project was to be followed by other dams that together would add 30,000 ha (74,100 acres) for food production <ref>[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Mauritania-AGRICULTURE.html Nations Encyclopedia], Retrieved [[June 11]] [[2008]]</ref>. 

The Gorgol river was a source of concern amongst environmentalists form the mid 1970s with new water damming projects on the river. In [[1976]], [[Schistosomiasis]], also known as snail fever, a [[parasitic disease]] caused by several species of [[fluke]]  of the genus ''[[Schistosoma]]'' was believed to be increasing along the river valley resulting from disastrous Sahelian drought. A report conducted between May and November 1974, relvealed the prevalence and intensity of schistosomiasis, and the relevant species of snails. Particularly affected was the [[M'Bout]] area nearest the proposed reservoir and dam at [[Foum Gleita]]. Rates of schistisomiasis were lowest in [[Kaedi]] near the confluence of the Gorgol and Senegal rivers.
