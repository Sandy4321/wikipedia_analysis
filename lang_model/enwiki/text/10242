The '''New Harmony Toll Bridge''', also known as the '''Harmony Way Bridge''', is a two-lane bridge across the [[Wabash River]] that connects [[Illinois Route 14]] with [[Indiana State Road 66]], which is Church Street in [[New Harmony, Indiana]].  The bridge links [[White County, Illinois]] with [[Posey County, Indiana]]. The four-span bridge is owned by the [[White County Bridge Commission]] and was built without federal funds in 1930 by the Big Wabash Bridge Company of Carmi, Illinois.<ref name=close>{{cite news|url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2008/apr/30/new-harmony-bridge-reopens/|title=New Harmony bridge reopens|first=Len |last=Wells|date=April 30, 2008|work=Evansville Courrier and Press|accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref><ref name=eighty>{{cite news|url=http://www.carmitimes.com/area_news/x1733655741/80th-birthday-for-a-New-Harmony-icon?img=1|title=80th birthday for a New Harmony icon|work=Carmi Times|date=December 31, 2010|accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref>  The next bridge across the Wabash about 15 miles (24 km) downstream is the [[Wabash Memorial Bridge]] near [[Mount Vernon, Indiana]] and the next bridge upstream is for [[Interstate 64]], which does not allow farm vehicles.<ref name=close/> 
==Details==
As originally designed, the bridge is 2,579 feet (.49 of a mile) long.  It has 47 spans (from west to east): 31 simple I-beam approach spans, two deck-truss spans, four through-truss spans (of 232 ft, 233 ft, 233 ft and 300 ft), and 10 simple beam approach spans, all with a 20-foot wide concrete roadway.<ref>NRHP Application p. 2-3</ref> The bridge is the first highway bridge erected across the lower Wabash River and the oldest remaining bridge in use over the Wabash<U+2019>s length in Illinois and half of Indiana.<ref name=p9>NRHP Application p. 9</ref> The original owner was a private company, the Big Wabash Bridge Company of Carmi, Illinois, which was chartered by Congress to build and operate the bridge on May 1, 1928.<ref>Public Law 70-340, 45 Stat. 480, "Authorizing Roy Clippinger [et al.]...to construct, maintain, and operate a bridge across the Wabash River...."</ref>  The company contracted with the he Nashville Bridge Company of Nashville, Tennessee to build it. The bridge opened on December 21, 1930,<ref>NRHP Application p. 15</ref> and 10,000 people attended the dedication of the bridge on December 30, 1930.<ref name=eighty/><ref>NRHP Application p. 16</ref> In 1941, Congress created the White County Bridge Commission as a joint Illinois-Indiana agency to purchase the bridge from the Big Wabash Bridge Company for $895,000.<ref name=borah>[http://openjurist.org/199/f2d/213/borah-v-white-county-bridge-commission ''Borah v. White County Bridge Commission'',] 199 F.2d 213 (7th Cir. 1952).</ref> The Commission remains as the only joint state toll bridge commission chartered by Congress.<ref>NRHP Application p. 17</ref>

About 900 vehicles cross the bridge each day. The bridge collects an average of $30,000 in monthly tolls and has $22,000 in monthly expenses.<ref name=close/> The bridge was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 in part because of its relationship to historic [[New Harmony, Indiana]] as well as the bridge's age.<ref name=update>{{cite news|url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2010/nov/15/wabash-bridge-change-urged-public-ownership//|title=Public ownership urged for Wabash Bridge at New Harmony|first=Len |last=Wells|date=November 15, 2010|work=Evansville Courrier and Press|accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20071012.HTM|title=National Register of Historic Places Listing|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref><ref name=p9/> The three-member Commission was established by Congress on April 12, 1941,<ref>Public Law 77-37, 55 Stat. 140, "Act to Create the White County Bridge Commission,"</ref> but Congress repealed the statute providing for an appointment mechanism in 1998. The Commission's general manager, who is 75, speculated that the bridge would close if the three current commissioners would resign or die.<ref name=update/> The 1941 law contemplated, but did not require, that once the original bonds financing the construction of the bridge were retired, the bridge would be transferred to Illinois and Indiana and the Commission would be dissolved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/attorneygeneral/files/2001-12.pdf|title=Official Opinion 2001-12|date=January 29, 2002|authors=Stephen Carter and Gregory Zoeller|publisher=Indiana Attorney General|accessdate=2011-01-16}}</ref>

In 1951, current the toll booth on the western edge of the river was constructed by the Electronic Signal Company, to replace an earlier booth on the eastern edge.<ref>NRHP Application p. 8</ref> In 1952, a tollpayer sued to exercise his right to inspect the books and records of the Commission, but lost his lawsuit and was not allowed access.<ref name=borah/> In 1955, the [[General Accounting Office]] issued a report critical of the Commission and claiming that one commissioner had a conflict of interest. In response, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a suit seeking removal of the Commissioner and recovery of the misapplied funds.  However, the courts dismissed the case.<ref>[http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/275/275.F2d.529.12730.html ''United States v. White County Bridge Commission'',] 275 F.2d 529 (7th Cir. 1960).</ref>

In 1994, the Commission contracted to apply an epoxy coating on the bridge's surface, but the coating delaminated and the Commission refused to pay the contractor claiming that the coating had not been applied correctly.  After a trial, the Commission lost the lawsuit and paid.<ref>'' J.S. Sweet Co. v. White County Bridge Comm'n'', 714 N.E.2d 219 (Ind.Ct.App.1999).

From September 2007 to April 2008, cracks in some of the concrete support piers caused the bridge to closed to all traffic. During the closure, contractors drove new pilings to help support existing piers and made other repairs mandated by engineers.<ref name=close/> In 2010, engineers determined that the bridge requires an additional $6 million in repairs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.carmitimes.com/news/x1684099688/Posey-White-entity-proposed-to-run-New-Harmony-bridge|title=Posey-White entity proposed to run New Harmony bridge|first=Braden |last=Willis|work=Carmi Times|date=November 11, 2010|accessdate=2011-01-16}}</ref> The National Bridge Inventory has rated the bridge "Structurally Deficient."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nationalbridges.com/nbi_record.php?StateCode=17&struct=000097990121309|title=National Bridge Inventory Bridges|publisher=Alexander Svirsky|accessdate=2011-01-31}}</ref>
