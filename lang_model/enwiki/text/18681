The '''Laurel Run mine fire''' is an underground [[mine fire]] near the communities of [[Laurel Run, Pennsylvania|Laurel Run]] and [[Georgetown, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Georgetown]], in [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania]], in the United States. The fire started burning in 1915 at the [[Red Ash Coal Mine]]. Attempts to control it lasted from 1915 to 1957 and recommenced in 1966.<ref name = "coal fires">{{Citation|editor = Glenn B.

==Start of the fire and early history==
The Laurel Run mine fire began on December 6, 1915, in the Red Ash Coal Mine. In this mine, a miner accidentally left a [[carbide lamp]] hanging from a [[mine timber]], which caught fire. Because of the lack of a night watchman on hand, the fire was unnoticed for the entire weekend. The fire was first noticed when work resumed the next week. Upon noticing the fire, attempts were made to block off its air supply by pouring sand in the area of the fire and filling the openings of the mine with concrete. Once this was done, the owners of the Red Ash Coal Mine stated that the fire was under control.<ref name = "coal fires"/>

By 1921, it became evident that the mine fire had persisted and spread. The company operating the Red Ash Coal Mine began placing temporary barriers to stop the spread of the fire so that the rest of the mine could continue to be worked. Mining in the area ended in 1957. At this point attempts to stop the spread of the fire also ceased.<ref name = "coal fires"/>

==Later history==
In September 1962, a number of residents of the nearby community of Laurel Run was forced to abandon their home due to [[subsidence]] (due to removal{{huh|date=January 2014}}<!-- miners removed them, or burned away? --> of the mine's pillars in the area) and fumes from the mine fire.<ref name = "coal fires"/><ref name = "underground">{{Citation|author = Abandoned Mine Research, Inc.|url = http://www.undergroundminers.com/laurelrun.html|title = Laurel Run Mine Fire|year = 2005|accessdate = January 30, 2014}}</ref> The community at this point became aware of the presence of an uncontrolled mine fire in the area.<ref name = "coal fires"/>

In the early 1960s, the then-Pennsylvania governor [[William Scranton]] and the congressman [[Daniel J. Flood]] arrived at the area of the Laurel Run mine fire and called upon the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]] to aid in containing it.<ref name = "underground"/>

By 1964, local plantlife was dying out and residents of Laurel Run were experiencing adverse symptoms such as [[headache]]s. In February 1964, high levels of [[carbon monoxide]] and [[carbon dioxide]] were observed in the area. In this year, the mine gasses reaching the surface gave off a blue glow at nights.<ref name = "underground"/> On March 19, 1964, the DMMI{{huh|date=January 2014}} announced a [[United States dollar|$]]1,000,000 cleanup project for the Laurel Run area. The state of Pennsylvania contributed $500,000.<ref name = "unseen danger"/> In 1965, evacuation of Laurel Run began in earnest, led by the Appalachian Regional Commission.<ref name = "underground"/>

However, on April 23, 1966, a plan to control the mine fire was put into action.<ref name = "coal fires"/><ref name = "underground"/> A series of [[borehole]]s were dug in the area to determine the scope of the fire. It was found that it had spread to under the community of Laurel Run. It was also found that the fire had spread to the community of Georgetown. However, in Georgetown, the ground was relatively stable and did cause problems aboveground.<ref name = "coal fires"/> [[Clay]] and [[sand]] were injected into the boreholes to contain the fire. The containment efforts occupied 800,000 square feet. Amy Randolph of the [[Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection]] estimated that the efforts would cost $4,000,000. This figure was later revised to $9,000,000.<ref name = "underground"/> Meanwhile, the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] relocated 850 residents who lived over the mine fire. The area of the fire that was below Georgetown was controlled by blocking off the tunnels in the vicinity, robbing it of the necessary oxygen to continue burning.<ref name = "coal fires"/>

In 1973, the containment of the mine fire was stated to be complete, but it continues to burn into the 21st century.<ref name = "underground"/><ref name = "coal fires"/> However, the community of Laurel Run is not endangered by it anymore.{{huh|date=January 2014}}<!-- because they moved away from over-the-fire, because the fire is no longer under it, or because the geology prevents the ground from shifting and gases from escaping there?--><ref name = "coal fires"/>
The people of Laurel Run were able to gain more governmental support in combating the Laurel Run mine fire than the people of Centralia were in stopping the [[Centralia mine fire]].<ref>{{Citation|author = Melissa A.

==In the 21st century==
Jude M.

In 2013, Michael Corgan, a businessman from [[Wilkes-Barre Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre Township]] was granted permission to [[strip mining|strip mine]] 40 acres of land on top of the Laurel Run mine fire, on the condition that the strip mining operations remained at least {{convert|120|ft|m}} above the fire. Strip mining on top of a mine fire had not previously been done.

==Geology==
The geographical setting of the Laurel Run mine fire has been compared to that of the [[Centralia mine fire]]. The Laurel Run mine fire was located on the southern spur of the Wilkes-Barre [[syncline]]. It is part of the [[ridge and valley]] geographical province. The [[coal bed]]s that are on fire are the Ross bed, the Top Red Ash bed, and the Bottom Red Ash bed. The coal beds dip 10 or 15 degrees to the north. The [[Llwellyn Formation]] is situated on top of the Red Ash bed and the Pottsville [[conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]] is situated below it.<ref name = "coal fires"/>

Due to the geographical features of the area, the mine fire is only able to spread to the northeast, northwest, and southwest.<ref name = "coal fires"/>

In some areas in the vicinity of the fire, the ground has cracked open. However, the surface temperature is not as hot as the Centralia mine fire.<ref name = "coal fires"/> The mine fire is {{convert|200|ft|m}} to {{convert|300|ft|m}} underground and burns at a temperature of around {{convert|1000|F|C}}.<ref name = "underground"/>

Had the mine fire not been contained, it would have eventually spread under the entirety of the [[Wyoming Valley]].<ref name = "unseen danger">{{Citation|author = David DeKok|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=erHlOx4WfIgC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=%22Laurel+Run+Mine+Fire%22&source=bl&ots=2WJAbf-nJz&sig=V3wWUcAQ8RM_uU6i2DA7G52wgcY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QLzqUvUblK2xBOXTgegP&ved=0CCwQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=%22Laurel%20Run%20Mine%20Fire%22&f=false|title = Unseen Danger: A Tragedy of People, Government, and the Centralia Mine Fire|date = April 1, 2000|accessdate = January 30, 2014}}</ref>
