'''''Black Swan''''' is a 2010 American [[psychological thriller]] and [[horror film]]<ref>[http://video.tvguide.com/Direct+Effect/Darren+Aronofsky+of+BLACK+SWAN/8030735 "Direct Effect Season 1, Episode 7 Darren Aronofsky of BLACK SWAN".] Fox Movie Channel Originals. TV Guide. October 8, 2011.</ref><ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/dec/09/news/la-en-aronofsky-20101209 "'Black Swan' director Darren Aronofsky likes a challenge".] Los Angeles Times. December 09, 2010</ref> directed by [[Darren Aronofsky]] and starring [[Natalie Portman]], [[Vincent Cassel]], and [[Mila Kunis]]. The plot revolves around a production of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Swan Lake]]'' ballet by a prestigious New York City company. The production requires a ballerina to play both the innocent and fragile White Swan, for which the committed dancer Nina (Portman) is a perfect fit, as well as the dark and sensual Black Swan, which are qualities embodied by the new arrival Lily (Kunis). When the two dancers compete for the part, the pressure causes Nina to gradually lose her tenuous grip on reality as she descends into a living nightmare.

Aronofsky conceived the premise by connecting his viewings of a production of ''[[Swan Lake]]'' with an unrealized screenplay about [[Understudy|understudies]] and the notion of being haunted by a double, similar to the folklore surrounding [[doppelg<U+00E4>nger]]s. Aronofsky cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky's "[[The Double: A Petersburg Poem|The Double]]" as another inspiration for the film. The director also considered ''Black Swan'' a companion piece to his 2008 film ''[[The Wrestler (2008 film)|The Wrestler]]'', with both films involving demanding performances for different kinds of art. He and Portman first discussed the project in 2000, and after a brief attachment to [[Universal Studios]], ''Black Swan'' was produced in New York City in 2009 by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]]. Portman and Kunis trained in ballet for several months prior to filming, and notable figures from the ballet world helped with film production to shape the ballet presentation.

The film premiered as the opening film for the [[67th Venice International Film Festival]] on September&nbsp;1, 2010. It had a [[limited release]] in the United States starting December&nbsp;3, 2010 and opened nationwide on December&nbsp;17. ''Black Swan'' received critical praise upon its release, particularly for Portman's performance and Aronofsky's direction, and was a significant box office success, grossing $329 million worldwide. The film received five [[Academy Award]] nominations and Portman won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] award for the film, as well as many other Best Actress awards in several guilds and festivals, while Aronofsky was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. In addition, the film itself received a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].

==Plot==
<!-- Do not repeat wikilinks for cast members when linked previously in the same article prose. Please see [[WP:Linking]] to avoid overlinking. -->
Nina Sayers, a young dancer with a prestigious New York City ballet company, lives with her mother, Erica, a former dancer. The company is preparing to open the season with ''[[Swan Lake]]''. The director, Thomas Leroy, has to cast a new principal dancer after forcing Beth Macintyre into retirement. Leroy wants the same ballerina to portray both the innocent, fragile White Swan and her dark, sensual twin, the Black Swan. Nina competes for the part. Although her audition goes badly, she asks Thomas to reconsider. He tells her she is ideal for the White Swan but lacks the passion necessary for the Black Swan. When he forcibly kisses her, she shows some spirit and bites him, and lands the part.

An intoxicated Beth angrily confronts Thomas and Nina. She is later hit by a car and seriously injured in what Thomas suspects was a suicide attempt. Nina begins to witness strange happenings. Thomas, meanwhile, becomes increasingly critical of her "frigid" dancing and advises her to stop being a perfectionist and lose herself in the role. Thomas points to Lily (Kunis), another dancer in the company, whom he describes as lacking Nina's flawless technique but possessing an uninhibited quality that Nina has not shown.

The relationship between the two dancers is cool because of Lily's indiscretions, but Lily invites Nina to a night out. Nina is hesitant at first but decides to go against her mother's wishes. At a restaurant that evening, Lily offers Nina a capsule of ecstasy to help her loosen up. Though reassured its effects will only last a few hours, Nina turns it down. Lily later slips it into her drink at a nightclub while she is absent. Nina returns home late, fights with her mother, barricades herself in her room, and has sex with Lily.

Next morning, Nina wakes up alone and late for rehearsal. When she arrives at the studio, she finds Lily dancing as the Swan Queen. Furious, she confronts Lily and asks her why she did not wake her up that morning. After Lily tells her she spent the night with a man whom she met at the club, Nina realizes she imagined the encounter.

Nina's hallucinations become stronger as she sees Thomas and Lily have sex in a backstage area and Beth stabbing herself in the face at the hospital with a nail filer which Nina drops bloodied in the elevator. She has a violent argument with her mother, after which Nina passes out. Concerned about Nina's erratic behavior, her mother tries to prevent her from performing on opening night; enraged, Nina stands up to her mother and forces her way out of the apartment. Since her mother had called to say Nina was sick, Thomas assigned understudy Lily to take over, but reluctantly gives way when Nina insists on performing.

The first act goes well, until Nina is distracted by a hallucination during a lift, causing her partner, playing the Prince, to drop her. Distraught, she returns to her dressing room and finds Lily there. As Lily announces she is to play the Black Swan, she transforms into Nina's double. Nina shoves her into a mirror, shattering it. She grabs a shard of glass and stabs her rival in the stomach, killing her. The corpse transforms back into Lily. Nina hides the body and returns to the stage to dance with passion and sensuality. Sprouting feathers, her arms become black wings as she finally loses herself and is transformed into a black swan. At the end of the act, she receives a standing ovation. Offstage, Thomas and the rest of the cast congratulate her on her stunning performance. Nina takes Thomas by surprise and kisses him.

Back in her dressing room before the final act, Nina is congratulated by Lily, showing that their fight was imaginary. The mirror, however, is still shattered. She removes a shard from her own body and realizes she had stabbed ''herself''. Dancing the last scene, in which the White Swan throws herself off a cliff, Nina spots her mother weeping in the audience. As Nina falls backward onto a hidden mattress, the theater erupts in thunderous applause. Thomas and the cast gather to congratulate her<U+2014>only to find that she is severely bleeding. As the white ceiling lights envelop her, she whispers, "I felt it. Perfect. It was perfect."

[[Darren Aronofsky]] first became interested in ballet when his sister studied dance at the [[High School of Performing Arts]] in New York City. The basic idea for the film started when he hired screenwriters to rework a screenplay called ''The Understudy'', which was about off-Broadway actors and explored the notion of being haunted by a double. Aronofsky said the screenplay had elements of ''[[All About Eve]]'', [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[The Tenant]]'', and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s novella ''[[The Double: A Petersburg Poem|The Double]]''. The director had also seen numerous productions of ''Swan Lake'', and he connected the duality of the White Swan and the Black Swan to his script.<ref name="roles">{{cite news |last=Wloszczyna |first=Susan |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-blackswaninside22_ST_N.htm |title=''Black Swan'' stars step deftly into roles |work=USA Today |date=July 22, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5s9abMWwQ |archivedate=August 21, 2010 }}</ref> When researching for production of ''Black Swan'', he found ballet to be "a very insular world" whose dancers were "not impressed by movies". Regardless, the director found active and inactive dancers to share their experiences with him. He also stood backstage to see the [[Moscow State Academy of Choreography|Bolshoi Ballet]] perform at the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]].<ref name="kisses">{{cite news|last=Ditzian |first=Eric |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1646763/20100830/story.jhtml |title=''Black Swan'' Director Darren Aronofsky On Ballet, Natalie Portman And Lesbian Kisses |work=MTV Movies Blog |publisher=MTV |date=August 30, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5sNCB5EQT |archivedate=August 30, 2010}}</ref>

Aronofsky called ''Black Swan'' a companion piece to his previous film ''The Wrestler'', recalling one of his early projects about a love affair between a wrestler and a ballerina. He eventually separated the wrestling and the ballet worlds as "too much for one movie". He compared the two films: "Wrestling some consider the lowest art<U+2014>if they would even call it art<U+2014>and ballet some people consider the highest art. But what was amazing to me was how similar the performers in both of these worlds are. They both make incredible use of their bodies to express themselves."<ref name="kisses"/> About the psychological thriller nature of ''Black Swan'', actress Natalie Portman compared the film's tone to Polanski's 1968 film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'',<ref>{{cite news|last=Wigler |first=Josh |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/08/05/natalie-portman-likens-black-swan-to-rosemarys-baby-in-terms-of-tone/ |title=Natalie Portman Likens ''Black Swan'' To ''Rosemary's Baby'' In Terms Of Tone |work=MTV Movies Blog |publisher=MTV |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rlueS6jv |archivedate=August 6, 2010}}</ref> while Aronofsky said Polanski's ''[[Repulsion]]'' (1965) and ''The Tenant'' (1976) were "big influences" on the final film.<ref name="kisses"/> Actor Vincent Cassel also compared ''Black Swan'' to Polanski's early works and additionally compared it to [[David Cronenberg]]'s early works.<ref>{{cite news|last=Buchanan |first=Kyle |url=http://www.movieline.com/2010/08/vincent-cassel-on-mesrine-black-swan-and-acting-you-need-a-hard-on-perpetually.php?page=3 |title=Vincent Cassel on ''Mesrine'', ''Black Swan'', and Acting |work=[[Movieline]] |date=August 26, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5sK8q2fXY |archivedate=August 28, 2010}}</ref>

===Controversies===
====Costume design====
Amy Westcott is credited as the costume designer and received several award nominations. A publicized controversy arose regarding the question of who had designed 40 ballet costumes for Portman and the dancers. An article in the British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' suggested those costumes had actually been created by [[Rodarte]]'s Kate and Laura Mulleavy.<ref>{{cite news|title=Feathers ruffled over Black Swan |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/feathers-ruffled-over-black-swan-2192042.html |accessdate=January 30, 2011 |work=The Independent |location=UK |first=Susie |last=Mesure |date=January 23, 2011}}</ref> Westcott challenged that view and stated that in all only 7 costumes, among them the black and white swan, had been created in a collaboration between Rodarte, Westcott, and Aronofsky. Furthermore, the corps ballet's costumes were designed by Zack Brown (for the American Ballet Theater), and slightly adapted by Westcott and her costume design department. Westcott said: "Controversy is too complimentary a word for two people using their considerable self-publicising resources to loudly complain about their credit once they realized how good the film is."<ref>{{cite web|title=Black Swan: Amy Westcott Interview |url=http://clothesonfilm.com/black-swan-amy-westcott-interview/18997/ |accessdate=January 30, 2011 |publisher=Clothes On Film |first=Chris |last=Laverty |date=January 28, 2011}}</ref>

==Soundtrack==
{{Main|Black Swan: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack}}

Goodridge described Portman's performance, "[She] is captivating as Nina&nbsp;... she captures the confusion of a repressed young woman thrown into a world of danger and temptation with frightening veracity." The critic also commended Cassel, Kunis, and Hershey in their supporting roles, particularly comparing Hershey to [[Ruth Gordon]] in the role of "the desperate, jealous mother". Goodridge praised Libatique's cinematography with the dance scenes and the psychologically "unnerving" scenes: "It's a mesmerising psychological ride that builds to a gloriously theatrical tragic finale as Nina attempts to deliver the perfect performance."<ref>{{cite news|last=Goodridge |first=Mike |url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/latest-reviews/-black-swan/5017589.article |title=Black Swan |work=[[Screen International|Screen Daily]] |date=September 1, 2010 |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref>

Kirk Honeycutt of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a mixed review. He wrote, "[''Black Swan''] is an instant guilty pleasure, a gorgeously shot, visually complex film whose badness is what's so good about it. You might howl at the sheer audacity of mixing mental illness with the body-fatiguing, mind-numbing rigors of ballet, but its lurid imagery and a hellcat competition between two rival dancers is pretty irresistible." Honeycutt commended Millepied's "sumptuous" choreography and Libatique's "darting, weaving" camera work. The critic said of the thematic mashup, "Aronofsky&nbsp;... never succeeds in wedding genre elements to the world of ballet&nbsp;... White Swan/Black Swan dynamics almost work, but the horror-movie nonsense drags everything down the rabbit hole of preposterousness."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Honeycutt |first=Kirk |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film-reviews/black-swan-film-review-1004112184.story |title=Black Swan&nbsp;<U+2013> Film Review |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=September 1, 2010}}</ref> Similarly, in a piece for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', [[Rob Kirkpatrick]] praised Portman's performance but compared the film's story to that of ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995) and ''[[Burlesque (2010 musical film)|Burlesque]]'' (2010) while concluding ''Black Swan'' is "simply higher-priced cheese, Aronofsky's camembert to [''Burlesque'' director Steve] Antin's cheddar.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rob-kirkpatrick/burlesque-and-black-swan_b_806378.html |title=Burlesque and Black Swan: The Showgirls of Burlesque vs. the Showgirls of Ballet? |publisher=[[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate=March 15, 2011 |first=Rob |last=Kirkpatrick |date=January 14, 2011}}</ref> [[The Canadian Press]] also reported that some Canadian ballet dancers felt that the film depicted dancers negatively and exaggerated elements of their lives but gave Portman high marks for her dance technique.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dancers object to Black Swan's stereotypes |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/12/26/blackswan-reaction-ballet-stereotypes.html |accessdate=December 26, 2010 |newspaper=CBC.ca |date=December 26, 2010 |agency=The Canadian Press}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' interviewed five ballet dancers, [[Tamara Rojo]], [[Lauren Cuthbertson]], [[Edward Watson (dancer)|Edward Watson]], [[Elena Glurjidze]], and Cassa Pancho, and they commented that some movements in the film are not professional, and the representation of the profession is stereotypical and inaccurate.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mackrell |first=Judith |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2011/jan/05/black-swan-natalie-portman-tamara-rojo |title=What Britain's ballet stars made of Black Swan |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=January 5, 2011}}</ref>
