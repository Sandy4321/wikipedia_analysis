'''Whitstable''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8><U+028D><U+026A>tst<U+0259>b<U+0259>l}}) is a seaside town in northeast [[Kent]], [[England]]. It is {{convert|8|km|mi|0}} north of the city of [[Canterbury]] and {{convert|3|km|mi|0}} west of the seaside town of [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]]. It is part of the [[City of Canterbury|Canterbury Local Authority district]], that is [[Canterbury City Council]] and has a population of about 30,000.

Known as the "Pearl of Kent", Whitstable is famous for its oysters, which have been collected in the area since at least Roman times. The town itself dates back to before the writing of the [[Domesday Book]]. Whitstable's distinctive character and ambience is popular with tourists, and its maritime heritage is celebrated with the annual Oyster Festival in July. Freshly caught shellfish are available throughout the year at several seafood restaurants and pubs in the town.

In 1830, the world's first passenger railway service was opened by the [[Canterbury and Whitstable Railway]] Company and, in 1832, the company opened Whitstable harbour and extended the line to enable passage to London from the port. The railway has since closed but the harbour still plays an important role in the town's economy.

== History ==

Archaeological finds indicate that the Whitstable area was inhabited during the [[Palaeolithic]] era, the [[Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age]].<ref name="Up to 1000AD">{{cite web  | title = Up to 1000AD  | publisher = Canterbury City Council | url = http://www.canterbury.gov.uk/buildpage.php?id=2425  | accessdate = 2007-05-20 }}</ref> Oysters were harvested in the area in [[ancient Rome|Roman]] times,<ref name="oyster">{{cite web  | title = Whitstable Oyster Company  | publisher = Whitstable Oyster Fishery Company | url = http://www.oysterfishery.co.uk/history%20of%20the%20company.html  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref> and charters indicate that there were [[Saxon]] settlements where salt production and coastal trade occurred.<ref name="Up to 1000AD">{{cite web  | title = Up to 1000AD  | publisher = Canterbury City Council | url = http://www.canterbury.gov.uk/buildpage.php?id=2425  | accessdate = 2007-05-20 }}</ref> The town was first recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, under the name Witenestaple, meaning "the meeting place of the white post", which referred to a local landmark. At that time, Witenestaple was an administrative area which stretched from the coast to the village of [[Blean]], {{convert|3|km|mi|0}} north of Canterbury. The area contained three [[Manorialism|manors]] at Seasalter, Northwood and [[Swalecliffe]]. The Seasalter and Swalecliffe manors were owned by the church, and the manor at Northwood was run by noblemen on behalf of the king. Fisheries were located at the Seasalter manor, [[saltworks]] were at the Northwood manor, and pigs were farmed at the forest in Blean.<ref name="1000 - 1500">{{cite web  | title = 1000 - 1500  | publisher = Canterbury City Council | url = http://www.canterbury.gov.uk/cgi-bin/buildpage.pl?mysql=2426  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref> By 1226, the name of the area had evolved into Whitstaple.<ref name="place names">{{cite web  | title = Kent place names  | publisher = bbc.co.uk | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/places/names/names_o-z.shtml  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref> Around 1300, saltworks were opened at the Seasalter manor, and, in 1325, a sea wall was built there to prevent coastal flooding.<ref name="1000 - 1500">{{cite web  | title = 1000 - 1500  | publisher = Canterbury City Council | url = http://www.canterbury.gov.uk/cgi-bin/buildpage.pl?mysql=2426  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref>
[[Image:Cobbled Street in Whitstable.jpg|right|thumb|Harbour Street in Whitstable Town Centre.]]
By 1413, the three manors had combined, forming the Whitstaple manor, and had been sold to a religious foundation in [[Essex]].<ref name="1000 - 1500"/> In the 1500s, the manor was seized by King [[Henry VIII]] during his suppression of the church, and was given back to the nobility. In 1574, a Royal Patent was granted to the manor owner for the fishing of its oyster beds.<ref name="oyster">{{cite web  | title = Whitstable Oyster Company  | publisher = Whitstable Oyster Fishery Company | url = http://www.oysterfishery.co.uk/history%20of%20the%20company.html  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref> In the same year, the lands at Tankerton were incorporated into the manor.

Around the mid 1700s, goods and passengers began to be transported by ship between London and Whitstable, and a [[toll road]] was built to the cathedral city of Canterbury. These improvements in transport led to the town's development as a seaside resort; the first advertisements for [[bathing machine]]s at Whitstable appeared in 1768. In 1790, the manor was sold to private landowners. The rights to harvest the oyster beds were bought in 1793 by the newly established Oyster Company of Free Fishers and Dredgers.<ref name="1700 - 1800">{{cite web  | title = 1700 - 1800  | publisher = Canterbury City Council | url = http://www.canterbury.gov.uk/buildpage.php?id=2428  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref> 

On [[3 May]] [[1830]], the world's first steam-hauled passenger and freight railway service was opened by the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway Company. The line ran from Westgate in Canterbury to Whitstable town centre. The six-mile (10&nbsp;km) railway was designed by [[William James]] and built at a cost of [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]83,000. The railway line's initials, C&WR, and Whitstable's shellfish industry eventually led to its nickname: 'The Crab And Winkle Railway'. At first, trains were pulled along on ropes by steam-driven [[stationary engines|stationary winding engines]] up the inclined planes and by a locomotive for the rest of the journey. The winding engines were located at Tyler Hill and Clowes Wood. The locomotive used was the Invicta, an 0-4-0 inclined cylinder tender locomotive built by [[Robert Stephenson]] of Newcastle for <U+00A3>635, which pulled three carriages.<ref name="c&w">{{cite web  | title = The Past   | publisher = Crabandwinkle.org | url = http://www.crabandwinkle.org/past.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-20 }}</ref><ref name="scene">{{cite web  | title = Whitstable Harbour History   | publisher = Whitstablescene.co.uk | url = http://www.whitstablescene.co.uk/harbour1.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-20 }}</ref>

[[Image:Dsc01278.jpg|right|thumb|Whitstable Harbour ]]
Whitstable harbour was opened by the railway company in 1832, and the rail line was extended, enabling goods to be directly transferred from ships onto the trains. The harbour provided shelter for around 20 sailing ships of up to 150&nbsp;tons, and had sidings for around 80 rail wagons. A dock was built for transferring freight between sea-going and river vessels. Whitstable harbour's main trade was importing Northumberland coal, which was then taken to Canterbury or transported by the South Eastern Railway to [[Croydon]] and [[Reigate]].<ref name="c&w"/><ref name="scene"/> 

In 1834, the world's first [[season ticket]]s were issued for the C&WR line. They were sold to Canterbury residents travelling to Whitstable beach during the summer season.<ref name="c&w"/> Until its demolition in 1970, Whitstable was home to the world's oldest railway bridge.

In 1840, the Invicta locomotive was retired and replaced by horses until a third winding engine was built at South Street. The Invicta was kept for scrap, but in 1898 work began on its restoration. The restoration continued intermittently, until it was finally completed in 1977 in [[York]] by the [[National Railway Museum]]. The locomotive was returned to Canterbury on [[3 May]] [[1980]] to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the line. It is now displayed at the Canterbury Museum.<ref name="c&w"/><ref name="scene"/>

In 1845, the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway Company was bought by the South Eastern Railway, who then introduced steam locomotives capable of operating along the entire length of the railway. These locomotives were [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]-fired, so two ovens were built near the harbour to convert coal into coke. Coke production continued until 1880 when coal-fired locomotives took over. The ovens and their chimneys were demolished in 1892.<ref name="c&w"/><ref name="scene"/> On [[16 November]] [[1869]], 71 buildings in the town were destroyed by a [[The Great Fire of Whitstable, 1869|fire]] started at a shop near the harbour.<ref name="fire">{{cite book  | last=Goodsall|first=Robert|title = Whitstable, Seasalter and Swalecliffe  | date = 1938 }}</ref>

The [[Sea Cadet Corps (United Kingdom)|Sea Cadet Corps]] traces its origin to the town. In about 1856, the Naval Lads' Brigade was started in Whitstable by the Reverend Henry Barton. In 1904, it was renamed the Sea Cadet Corps.<ref name="Cadets">{{cite web  | title = Whitstable Sea Cadets  | publisher = Canterbury City Council | url = http://www.canterbury.co.uk/cgi-bin/buildpage.pl?mysql=334| accessdate = 2007-04-21 }}</ref>

In 1936, a plant to manufacture [[tarmacadam]] was built beside Whitstable Harbour, on the site of the old coke works, but after World War II, the harbour gradually fell into decay. In 1958, Whitstable Urban District Council purchased and repaired the harbour with the intention of rejuvenating the town's economy. The ownership of the harbour passed to Canterbury City Council in 1974.<ref name="squay">{{cite web  | title = South Quay public consultation  | publisher = Canterbury City Council | url = https://www.canterbury.gov.uk/buildpage.php?id=2323&prn=y  | accessdate = 2007-04-21 }}</ref> By the early 20th century, the Oyster Company of Free Fishers and Dredgers had become the Whitstable Oyster Fishery Company. Oyster production drastically declined between the 1940s and 1970s due to pollution, disease, bad weather and underinvestment. However, since the 1970s there has been a gradual improvement.<ref name="oyster">{{cite web  | title = Whitstable Oyster Company  | publisher = Whitstable Oyster Fishery Company | url = http://www.oysterfishery.co.uk/history%20of%20the%20company.html  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref> 

The Crab and Winkle Line finally closed in 1953. About 40% of the line was reopened as a footpath and cycleway under the stewardship of a local charity, the Crab and Winkle Line Trust. Plans exist to extend the path along the old line into the centre of Whitstable and out to the harbour.<ref name="c&w"/>

In September 2007 [http://www.ccw.kent.sch.uk ''The Community College Whitstable''] was the subject of a controversy over school uniform policy.<ref>{{cite web  | title = School's Uniform Rules Criticised | publisher = Meridian News | url = http://www.itvlocal.com/meridian/news/?player=MER_GoLocal_26&void=104655 | date=[[2007-10-05]] | accessdate = 2007-10-05 }}</ref> The school's headteacher Mrs Helena Sullivan-Tighe had decided to enforce the school uniform policy more rigidly. One day in September pupils at the school were inspected as they arrived for the school day and close attention was given in particular to footwear. The end result was that around 40 pupils were found to be wearing unsuitable footwear and they were removed from the learning environment and placed into isolation. In some cases parents of the children were not informed and only heard about the incident when their children returned home. The incident was called Gestapo-like and made the local news mainly because many of the isolated pupils had in fact been wearing plain black trainers sold in local stores as back-to-school shoes. A statement from Mrs Sullivan-Tighe was subsequently reported in local newspapers which confirmed the incident and in which it was revealed that the school had hurriedly purchased around 30 pairs of shoes so that most of the affected pupils could be returned to the learning environment without further interruption of their state education. The report also indicated that at least one pupil had remained in isolation for 3 days.
