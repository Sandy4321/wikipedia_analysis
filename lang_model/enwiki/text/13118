'''Debt deflation''' is a theory of [[economic cycles]], which holds that [[recessions]] and [[depression (economics)|depressions]] are due to the overall level of debt shrinking (deflating): the [[credit cycle]] is the cause of the [[economic cycle]].

The theory was developed by [[Irving Fisher]] following the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and the ensuing [[Great Depression]]. Debt deflation was largely ignored in favor of the ideas of [[John Maynard Keynes]] in [[Keynesian economics]], but has enjoyed a resurgence of interest since the 1980s, both in [[mainstream economics]] and in the [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] school of [[Post-Keynesian economics]], and has subsequently been developed by such Post-Keynesian economists as [[Hyman Minsky]] and [[Steve Keen]].

== Fisher's formulation ==
In Fisher's formulation of debt [[deflation]], when the debt bubble bursts the following sequence of events occurs:
{{quote
|Assuming, accordingly, that, at some point of time, a state of over-indebtedness exists, this will tend to lead to liquidation, through the alarm either of debtors or creditors or both. Then we may deduce the following chain of consequences in nine links:
# Debt liquidation leads to distress selling and to
# Contraction of deposit currency, as bank loans are paid off, and to a slowing down of velocity of circulation. This contraction of deposits and of their velocity, precipitated by distress selling, causes
# A fall in the level of prices, in other words, a swelling of the dollar. Assuming, as above stated, that this fall of prices is not interfered with by reflation or otherwise, there must be
# A still greater fall in the net worths of business, precipitating bankruptcies and 
# A like fall in profits, which in a "capitalistic," that is, a private-profit society, leads the concerns which are running at a loss to make
# A reduction in output, in trade and in employment of labor. These losses, bankruptcies and unemployment, lead to
# pessimism and loss of confidence, which in turn lead to 
# Hoarding and slowing down still more the velocity of circulation.
#:The above eight changes cause
# Complicated disturbances in the rates of interest, in particular, a fall in the nominal, or money, rates and a rise in the real, or commodity, rates of interest.
|{{Harv|Fisher|1933}}}}

== Subsequent developments ==
Debt deflation has been studied and developed largely in the [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian school]].

The [[Financial Instability Hypothesis]] of [[Hyman Minsky]], developed in the 1980s, complements Fisher's theory in providing an explanation of how credit bubbles form: FIH explains how bubbles form, while DD explains how they burst and the resulting economic effects. Mathematical models of debt deflation have recently been developed by Australian economist [[Steve Keen]].

Debt deflation has been referred to alliteratively as the "D-process" by [[Ray Dalio]] of [[Bridgewater Associates]], who suggests it as the template for understanding the [[financial crisis of 2007<U+2013>2010]].

== Mainstream interest ==
Initially Fisher's work was largely ignored, in favor of the work of Keynes.<ref name="shadow">[http://www.economist.com/businessfinance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13104022 Out of Keynes's shadow], [[The Economist]], Feb 12th 2009</ref>

The following decades saw occasional mention of deflationary spirals due to debt in the mainstream, notably in ''[[The Great Crash, 1929]]'' of [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] in 1954, and the [[credit cycle]] has occasionally been cited as a leading cause of economic cycles in the post-WWII era, as in {{harv|Eckstein|Sinai|1990}}, but private debt remained absent from mainstream macroeconomic models.
[[James Tobin]] cited Fisher as instrumental in his theory of economic instability.

The lack of influence of debt-deflation in academic economics is thus described by [[Ben Bernanke]] in {{Harvtxt|Bernanke|1995|loc=p. 17}}:
:Fisher's idea was less influential in academic circles, though, because of the counterargument that debt-deflation represented no more than a redistribution from one group (debtors) to another (creditors). Absent implausibly large differences in marginal spending propensities among the groups, it was suggested, pure redistributions should have no significant macroeconomic effects.

There was a renewal of interest in debt deflation in academia in the 1980s and 1990s,<ref>{{Harv|Bernanke|1995|loc=p. 17}}</ref> and a further renewal of interest in debt deflation due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007<U+2013>2010]] and the ensuing [[Late-2000s recession]].<ref name="shadow" />

== Similar theories ==
{{details|Austrian business cycle theory#Similar theories}}

Debt deflation is not the only economic theory that cites credit bubbles as a key factor in economic crises; the most noted other theory is [[Austrian business cycle theory]], which posits that economic crises are caused by excess credit growth and the malinvestment (misallocation of resources) that results, with these being caused by [[central bank]] [[monetary policy]] and the [[fractional-reserve banking]] system.

The difference between these may be stated as debt-deflation being a ''demand''-side theory, which emphasizes the period ''after'' the peak <U+2013> the end of a [[credit bubble]] and contraction of debt causing a fall in ''[[aggregate demand]]'' <U+2013> while the Austrian theory is a ''supply''-side theory, which emphasizes the period ''before'' the peak <U+2013> the growth of debt during the growth phase causing malinvestment. The theories may thus be seen as complementary, addressing different aspects of the issue, and are so-considered by some economists.<ref>For example, [[Steve Keen]] first emphasizes the credit bubble and debt-deflation, but also points to financialization (the [[FIRE economy]]), citing parts of the Austrian tradition approvingly.</ref>

There have been other theories of economic crisis citing credit, discussed [[Austrian business cycle theory#Similar theories|at the relevant section of Austrian business cycle theory]].
