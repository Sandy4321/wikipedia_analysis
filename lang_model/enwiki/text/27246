'''Mikengreg''' is an [[independent video game development]] team of Mike Boxleiter and [[Greg Wohlwend]]. Their games include ''[[Solipskier]]'' and ''[[Gasketball]]''. The two met in a game development class at [[Iowa State University]] and later began to collaborate on the [[Adobe Flash]] game ''[[Dinowaurs]]''. When the project was funded, they founded Intuition Games with other college friends in [[Ames, Iowa]], where they worked on small Flash games such as ''Gray'', ''Lifecraft'', and ''Fig. 8'' for Flash game sites such as [[Kongregate]]. ''Dinowaurs'' was one of the first games signed for the Kongregate platform. Their other games involved controlling the weather, influencing individuals in a riot, and riding a bicycle. Boxleiter and Wohlwend worked on several other games that were put on hiatus.

They later became Mikengreg in 2010 and released ''[[Solipskier]]'' in August for both Flash and [[iOS]] later that year. Its success let them take a more experimental approach towards their next game, the [[free-to-play]] ''[[Gasketball]]''. Mikengreg ran out of money during the game's development and lived off of friends' couches. The game was reviewed favorably upon its August 2012 launch, but did not earn near the developers' estimates.

== Intuition Games ==

Boxleiter and Wohlwend met in an experimental video game development class at [[Iowa State University]].<ref name="Iowa Mike"/><ref name="IG: 2009 interview"/> Wohlwend attempted to help Boxleiter with a project and drew a few aliens before quitting.<ref name="IG: 2009 interview"/> Boxleiter said he "didn't like [Wohlwend] much after that".<ref name="ISD: ISU"/> They met again as coworkers at the university's Virtual Reality Application Center during Boxleiter's final year of college. Upon discovering their close interests, they began to work on an [[Adobe Flash]] game named ''Dinowaurs'' while they completed college. Boxleiter graduated in 2007 with a degree in computer science, and Wohlwend a year later with a degree in graphic design. They concluded that they needed a company to make money while they worked on the game with collaborators,<ref name="ISD: ISU"/> and around May 2007,<ref name="IGN: Entry"/> founded Intuition Games at the university's [[ISU Research Park|Research Park]].<ref name="Iowa Mike"/> They decided to stay in [[Ames, Iowa]] due to its financial feasibility and local connections,<ref name="ISD: ISU"/> but two other members of the team, Josh Larson and Ted Martens, lived in [[Des Moines]] and [[Chicago]], respectively.<ref name="IGN: Entry"/> The team met as students at Iowa State through work and game development circles. They saw Flash games as an easy entry point into full-time self-employment, but planned to eventually work on console platforms such as [[WiiWare]]. Before ''Dinowaurs'', the team made a game about a destructive [[porpoise]], which was abandoned when ''Dinowaurs'' received funding.<ref name="IGN: Entry"/>

In their development process, Boxleiter or Wohlwend both proposed ideas that the pair would further develop. They would drop the ideas that did not fully excite them. The two also built games from keywords and brainstorming, and would flesh out the [[game mechanics]] through "heated" argument.<ref name="ISD: ISU"/> Their labor as a team was divided in that Wohlwend always did the art and Boxleiter the programming, as reflective of their skills at the time. The pair agreed to an assessment of their partnership as "[[left-brain]] [[right-brain]]", and agreed to the role of "editing" in their joint work, though they always retain their prototypes.<ref name="IG: 2009 interview"/> They both appreciated the "creative freedom" of being self-employed, though they struggled with the business aspects, relative workplace "isolation", low salaries, and lack of job stability.<ref name="ISD: ISU"/> Both were motivated to do their own work instead of contracted tasks. They thought of themselves as artists and of their work as experimental.<ref name="ISD: ISU"/> Boxleiter and Wohlwend worked long hours when making the Flash games, which they found exciting and unsustainable.<ref name="TouchArcade: On Success"/> At Intuition, they worked on games such as ''Dinowaurs'', ''Gray'', ''Lifecraft'', and ''Fig. 8'', and participated in at least six [[game jams]].<ref name="IG: 2009 interview"/> As of April 2010, they had created 10 games together.<ref name="ISD: ISU"/>

=== Dinowaurs ===

Intuition's first game, ''Dinowaurs'', is a [[strategy game|strategy]] and [[action game]] where two players compete as dinosaurs to seize the most cavemen settlements on a single screen. Captured settlements provide resources for upgrades to the players' dinosaurs. The object of this arms race is to kill the other dinosaur.<ref name="Iowa Mike"/> It features online matchmaking.<ref name="IG: Dinowaurs"/> The game was built from an unfinished Flash-based multiplayer strategy game started by Boxleiter and an image of a [[stegosaurus]] with a [[jetpack]] drawn by Martens.{{efn|Boxleiter's concept had been influenced by computer strategy games such as ''[[Master of Orion]]'', ''[[Master of Magic]]'', and ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'' and Boxleiter's interest in multiplayer games.<ref name="IGN: Entry"/>}} The team combined the concepts for a strategy game about dinosaurs fighting for food. They struggled with long-distance communication, but used a project management website and Skype to stay in touch. When looking for a platform, Intuition originally pitched the game with a clay dinosaur to [[Adult Swim]]<U+2014>who was funding Flash games<U+2014>but was declined for not being "edgy enough".<ref name="IGN: Entry"/> In June, they then tried then-new Flash site [[Kongregate]] via a connection Larson had made with its CEO Jim Greer at the 2007 [[Game Developers Conference]]. He asked the team to wait for their new Director of Games to be hired, who ended up being Intuition's contact at Adult Swim. The contact had liked the idea and thought the game worked better for Kongregate than did for Adult Swim,<ref name="IGN: Entry"/> and so funded the game by November 2007 as one of the first five for the Kongregate platform. The package was a one-year browser exclusivity agreement that let Intuition keep the intellectual property.<ref name="IGN: Growing Up"/>

''Dinowaurs'' was finished in two years for a 2009 release. Their later games would only take a few months apiece in comparison.<ref name="ISD: ISU"/> They abandoned the use of design documents after ''Dinowaurs'', and instead chose to refine and experiment in process.<ref name="IG: 2009 interview"/> ''IndieGames.com'' reported mixed reviews from players and recommended the game as "good solid fun" for newcomers and veterans.<ref name="IG: Dinowaurs"/> ''[[The Escapist]]'' described the game as similar to ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]]'' and "surprisingly complex" with its need for three tutorials.<ref name="Escapist: Dinowaurs"/> He complimented its "faux-retro" soundtrack and aesthetics, which he felt outweighed the learning curve's difficulty.<ref name="Escapist: Dinowaurs"/>

=== Other games ===

Intuition released ''Effing Hail'' and ''Gray'' around April 2009.<ref name="IG: Effing Hail"/><ref name="IG: Gray"/> Players in action game ''Effing Hail'' control hail and wind to destroy the most buildings and midair objects within a time limit. The hail grows in size when the wind is used to suspend it in air. The game was published through Kongregate.<ref name="IG: Effing Hail"/> As an example of their more experimental games, Intuition built ''Gray''<U+2014>a game about "political consciousness"<U+2014>as a result of their frustrations during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]].<ref name="ISD: ISU"/> Players control a single character and try to end a riot by influencing other individuals in the crowd.<ref name="IG: Gray"/> The game was featured at [[IndieCade]] in 2009.<ref name="ISD: ISU"/>

In the case of ''Fig. 8.'', Wohlwend thought of the idea based on a college art project.{{efn|In the project, Wohlwend followed a bike trail in the snow, metaphorically related it to the tribulations of romantic relationship, and made an art installation involving a bike spray-painted black with two errant red and blue tracks painted on the floor.<ref name="IG: 2009 interview"/>}} It went unused on their whiteboard for four months until they needed an idea, whereupon Boxleiter added game mechanics to the visuals. It took about ten hours to prototype the controls, and they tested a ten-wheel bike before deciding on two. The scrolling camera was inspired by a game Boxleiter had been playing called ''String Theory'', and they added the soundtrack last.<ref name="IG: 2009 interview"/> ''Fig. 8'' was funded by a sponsor.<ref name="GSW: Kickstarter"/> Boxleiter considers ''Gray'', ''Wild an Free'', and ''Fig. 8'' to be "small games".<ref name="Intuition: Liferaft hiatus"/> As projects, he considered them "more like vacations ... than actual work".<ref name="Intuition: Liferaft hiatus"/>

Intuition attempted to fund their next game, ''Liferaft'', via [[crowdfunding]] site [[Kickstarter]]. The game is set in a single day within an "abandoned testing facility ... in a post-apocalyptic [[sci-fi]]" world.<ref name="GSW: Kickstarter"/> The player-character is a young woman named Goss who had been surviving off of lichen until a giant squid crashes into the room and allows her escape. ''Liferaft'' was built for release in three episodes: her escape, "revelation", and "resolution".<ref name="GSW: Kickstarter"/> The core gameplay revolves around a "''[[Bionic Commando]]''-style grappling hook".<ref name="GSW: Kickstarter"/> Intuition released a two-level Flash demo where the game had [[16-bit era]] graphics and music composed by Danny Baranowsky of ''[[Canabalt]]'' and ''Fathom''. They expected development to take six months between November 2009 and February 2010.<ref name="GSW: Kickstarter"/> They canceled the Kickstarter and put the project on hiatus in October 2009 for two small Flash games and an intern's [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] project.<ref name="Intuition: Liferaft hiatus"/>

In March 2010 and under the moniker Mikengreg, Boxleiter and Wohlwend's ''4fourths'' was chosen among six games out of more than 150 submissions for inclusion in [[Kokoromi]]'s Gamma IV showcase. Submissions were based on the theme of "one button games".<ref name="IG: GAMMA IV"/> The four-player game is played with two teams each controlling spaceships on each side of the screen. One player on each team controls the ship's vertical height and the other fires the guns, which aim towards the center of the screen. Since every player only has one button, the vertical height controls boost the ship vertically when the button is pressed and leaves the ship to slowly descend when unpressed. The teams work together to shoot at and destroy enemy [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] ships that travel through the center of the screen. Teams can also shoot each other's ships as [[friendly fire]] is activated.<ref name="IG: GIV depth"/> The game was displayed at Gamma IV in San Francisco and at the 2010 Game Developers Conference.<ref name="IG: GAMMA IV"/> ''4fourths'' was Michael Rose of ''IndieGame.com''{{'s}} favorite game of the Gamma IV selections.<ref name="IG: GIV depth"/> It was later chosen for Brandon Boyer's Wild Rumpus London event in September 2011.<ref name="GSW: Wild Rumpus"/>

In November 2010, Mikengreg announced ''Liferaft: Zero'' and ''Solipskier''. The former is a "prequel teaser" to the Flash [[platform game]] ''Liferaft'' that they had announced the previous year, a game of trial-based challenges with wall-jumping and grappling<ref name="MG: hibernation"/> wherein girl clones attempt to swing and jump around test chambers to reach and ring a bell.<ref name="IG: Liferaft"/> Wohlwend and Boxleiter made the shorter version to limit the [[scope creep]] of the overall project.<ref name="MG: hibernation"/> ''IndieGames.com'' named the Flash game their third best browser platformer of the year.<ref name="IG: Liferaft Zero"/> Their other game, 4fourths, was put on hiatus for lack of resources.<ref name="MG: hibernation"/> They were interested in making games outside the Flash market.<ref name="TouchArcade: On Success"/>

== ''Solipskier'' ==

{{main|Solipskier}}

The sport-inspired ''Solipskier'' for iPhone and iPad<ref name="Gasket TouchArcade review"/> was their first released game as Mikengreg.<ref name="PA: Going Broke"/> It was designed as a Flash game, which set the limitations for its mechanics. The game concept came from a brainstorming session about [[parallax scrolling]], and was revised in fits of creativity. They paired the parallax scrolling with speed and began to prototype.<ref name="TouchArcade: On Success"/> The game was their first to receive widespread acclaim. Boxleiter first understood its potential when publishers fought for the bid to the game. At the time, it was solely designed for Flash and not iOS, though they were interested in making bigger games outside the Flash market. ''Solipskier'' for iOS made around $70,000 in its first two months (as compared to $15,000 from the Flash release), which let them work in other non-Flash mediums in the future.<ref name="TouchArcade: On Success"/>

Boxleiter spoke at the 2012 Game Developers Conference Indie Soapbox on how indie stars were made from hard work and not from the [[Independent Games Festival]]. He added that winning an award at the festival for ''Solipskier'' was an insignificant aspect of his career.<ref name="IG: IGF"/>

== ''Gasketball'' ==

{{main|Gasketball}}

Mikengreg continued to pay themselves their same salary, but now had the liberty to try new things since the income was stable.<ref name="TouchArcade: On Success"/> Wohlwend estimated that they discarded about six "fairly polished prototypes" over the development of their next game, ''Gasketball''.<ref name="TouchArcade: On Success"/> They were able to live on $20<U+2013>25,000 a year each in Iowa for the next two years while working on the new game.<ref name="PA: Going Broke"/> Wohlwend made somewhat more income due to other collaborations, such as ''Puzzlejuice'' with Asher Vollmer, but shared his income with Boxleiter.<ref name="PA: Going Broke"/> Even though ''Solipskier'' was successful, the duo did not have a following comparable to indie developers like [[Team Meat]] and thus felt like their external pressure was low. Instead, their pressure was internal.<ref name="TouchArcade: On Success"/> Wohlwend said he worked 100-hour weeks with no weekends or vacations while living off of the ''Solipskier'' funds.<ref name="PA: Going Broke"/> In making ''Gasketball'', Boxleiter and Wohlwend felt that their game quality had improved continually, but found the idea of a million-person audience "daunting" and Wohlwend questioned whether he could even recreate ''Solipskier''{{'s}} success.<ref name="TouchArcade: On Success"/> When they ran out of money, Boxleiter borrowed money from his parents, and eventually they both went homeless, living off of the couches of friends.<ref name="PA: Going Broke"/> They had decided to release the game as an ethically non-coercive free-to-play game, with a free base game and in-app purchases for the extended content, hopeful for 2% of five million downloads to purchase the game (a 2% conversion rate), but in practice, the rate was closer to 0.67%. The game had been downloaded 200,000 times in its August 2012 launch week and was briefly ranked near the top of an iTunes top downloads ranking, though it did not break the top 200 grossing chart.<ref name="PA: Going Broke"/>
