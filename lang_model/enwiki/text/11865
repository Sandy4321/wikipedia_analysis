The '''2011 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final''' was a [[association football|soccer]] match between the [[Seattle Sounders FC]] and the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]], played on October 4, 2011, at [[CenturyLink Field]] in [[Seattle]], Washington. The match was the culmination of the [[2011 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup]], a tournament open to amateur and professional soccer teams affiliated with the [[United States Soccer Federation]] (U.S. Soccer). This was the 98th edition of the [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|U.S. Open Cup]], the oldest ongoing competition in American soccer. The Seattle Sounders FC won by defeating the Chicago Fire 2<U+2013>0 with goals scored by [[Fredy Montero]] and [[Osvaldo Alonso]]. The attendance was 36,615, breaking the record for the final set the previous year when Seattle also won and hosted. Seattle became the first team since 1968 to win three consecutive U.S. Open Cup championships and the fourth team ever to do so in the 98-year history of the tournament.

Sounders FC automatically qualified for the third round of the U.S. Open Cup tournament by finishing among the top six in the [[2010 Major League Soccer season]]. The Fire did not automatically qualify, and had to play through two [[2011 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup qualification|qualification rounds]] before entering the official tournament. Prior to the final, Chicago and Seattle had met twice in 2011, with Seattle winning one game and the other ending in a draw.

The final was televised live on [[Fox Soccer]]. This was the second consecutive year the tournament final was played at CenturyLink Field.  As the winner of the tournament, Seattle earned a berth in the [[2012<U+2013>13 CONCACAF Champions League]] and received a $100,000 cash prize. Chicago received a $50,000 prize as the runner-up. Following the final, criticism was raised regarding Seattle winning hosting rights for each round they played. In response, U.S. Soccer announced changes to the rules for determining the host of tournament matches.

The U.S. Open Cup is an annual American soccer competition open to all U.S. Soccer affiliated teams, from amateur adult club teams to the professional clubs of [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS). The 2011 tournament was the 98th edition of the oldest soccer tournament in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/sports/stories/2010/10/06/crew-falls-in-open-cup-final.html |title=Soccer: Crew falls in Open Cup final |first=Shawn |last=Mitchell |date=October 5, 2010 |newspaper=The Columbus Dispatch |accessdate=September 3, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101013092633/http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/sports/stories/2010/10/06/crew-falls-in-open-cup-final.html| archivedate= October 13, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The MLS, which has teams that play in both the United States and Canada, was allowed to enter eight of its fifteen U.S.-based teams in the tournament. The top six MLS teams from the [[2010 Major League Soccer season|previous season's]] league standings qualified automatically for the tournament, while the remaining two spots were determined by [[2011 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup qualification|preliminary qualification matches]].<ref name="USOC101">{{cite web |url=http://www.portlandtimbers.com/news/2011/03/mls-101-primer-2011-tournament-structure |title=MLS 101: A primer on the 2011 tournament structure |first=Mark |last=Nelson |date=March 28, 2011 |publisher=Portland Timbers |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}</ref> The eight MLS entries began play in the third round of the tournament.

The Fire then turned their attention to their second and final qualification match hosted by the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] at [[Buck Shaw Stadium]] in [[Santa Clara, California]].

In the fifth round of penalties, with Chicago leading 5<U+2013>4, San Jose's [[Scott Sealy]] missed his shot as it deflected off of the crossbar, giving the Fire a second qualifier victory and a berth into the third round of the 2011 U.S. Open Cup tournament.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lepper |first=Geoff |title=USOC: Fire edge Quakes in PKs, through to round of 16 |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2011/05/25/usoc-fire-edge-quakes-pks-thru-round-16 |work=Major League Soccer |publisher=Major League Soccer |date=May 25, 2010 |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}</ref>

=== Analysis ===
With a better MLS regular season record and home field advantage, Sounders FC were the favorites to win the match; however, the Fire had improved throughout the year through better play from their [[Forward (association football)#Winger|wingers]] and [[midfielders]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/soundersfcblog/2016392656_poll_how_nervous_are_you_of_th.html |title=Poll: How nervous are you of the Chicago Fire? |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=October 4, 2011 |last=Mayers |first=Joshua}}</ref>

Seattle and Chicago had met twice in MLS regular season matches in 2011.  The first meeting, on April 9, 2011, resulted in a 2<U+2013>1 win for Sounders FC in front of their home crowd.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2014732761_apsocmlsfiresounders2ndldwritethru.html |title=White scores again, Sounders beat Fire 2<U+2013>1 |date=April 9, 2011 |newspaper=The Associated Press |accessdate=September 17, 2011}}</ref>  It was Seattle's 5th game of the season.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sounders/2014732535_sounders10.html |title=Sounders FC back in the win column |first=Joshua |last=Mayers |date=April 9, 2011 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |accessdate=September 17, 2011}}</ref> The second meeting was hosted by Chicago on June 4, 2011, and resulted in a 0<U+2013>0 draw.

In the days leading up to the final, Seattle had recently finished a long road trip.  Chicago's schedule made the match their third in a week's time. In preparation for the final, the managers fielded weaker sides during their respective league matches two days before the game, allowing them to rest several regular starters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2011/10/03/sounders-notebook-seattle-rested-ahead-usoc-final |title=Sounders Notebook: Seattle rested ahead of USOC final |first=Andrew |last=Winner |date=October 3, 2011 |publisher=Major League Soccer |accessdate=June 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2011/10/03/usoc-preview-seattle-chicago-primed-open-cup-final |title=USOC Preview: Seattle, Chicago primed for Open Cup final |first=Nate |last=Sulat |date=October 3, 2011 |publisher=Major League Soccer |accessdate=June 4, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Corr 2011-10-01">{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/fire/post/_/id/2056/oduro-fire-rally-to-draw-dynamo |title=Oduro, Fire rally to draw Dynamo |publisher=ESPN |date=October 1, 2011 |accessdate=October 2, 2011 |author=Corr, Charlie}}</ref>  The Sounders were playing well, having already clinched a [[2011 MLS Cup Playoffs|MLS playoff]] berth.

Schmid continued, "I thought Evans did a really good job. Sometimes we were stretched in the midfield, but I thought he did a very good job of stepping up to P<U+00E1>vel.

=== Host selection process changes ===
U.S. Soccer was criticized after the match for the secretive bid process that allows teams to outspend their opponents for hosting rights.  Both the blind bidding process for hosting tournament matches and the manner in which MLS teams qualified for the tournament were widely criticized.<ref name="AOL_rule_changes">{{cite news |url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/soccer/story/2011-10-05/us-open-cup-should-be-revamped-for-12 |title=U.S. Open Cup Could be Revamped for '12 |work=The Sporting News |date=October 5, 2011 |accessdate=October 6, 2011 |author=Straus, Brian}}</ref>  An example of the concerns raised around hosting came from FC Dallas midfielder [[Daniel Hernandez (soccer)|Daniel Hernandez]] on [[Twitter]], where he complained about Seattle's [[home-field advantage]] throughout the 2011 tournament.<ref name="USOC_notes"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.thenewstribune.com/soccer/2011/10/05/hoops-hernandez-is-a-troll-with-a-point/ |title=FC Dallas' Hernandez is a Troll&nbsp;...

It might make a few people happy, it might make a few people unhappy. But ultimately, I<U+2019>m not convinced that<U+2019>s what is going to raise the profile."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.thenewstribune.com/soccer/2011/10/06/hanauer-wants-voice-in-cup-changes/ |title=Hanauer wants voice in Open Cup changes |first=Don |last=Ruiz |date=October 6, 2011 |newspaper=The Tacoma News Tribune |accessdate=October 2, 2012}}</ref>

In January 2012, in preparation for the [[2012 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|2012 edition]] of the U.S. Open Cup, U.S. Soccer announced several changes to the tournament format.  Included in these changes was the introduction of a new host selection process.  Beginning in 2012, for all rounds of the tournament through the quarterfinals, a random host selection process would be used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ussoccer.com/News/Lamar-Hunt-U-S-Open-Cup/2012/01/2012-Open-Cup.aspx |title=Format, Composition and Schedule Finalized for 99th Edition of Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup |date=January 11, 2012 |publisher=U.S. Soccer |accessdate=May 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ussoccer.com/News/Lamar-Hunt-U-S-Open-Cup/2012/01/Open-Cup-Sidebar.aspx |title=Lower-Division Teams Relish Chance to Host Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Matches |date=January 11, 2012 |publisher=U.S. Soccer |accessdate=May 19, 2013}}</ref> While in previous years a blind bidding system was used to determine the host of a match, the new process has the host determined by blind draw if both teams' venues meet minimum standards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thecup.us/more-details-revealed-on-new-us-open-cup-hosting-process/ |title=More details revealed on new US Open Cup hosting process |first=Josh |last=Hakala |date=May 29, 2012 |publisher=TheCup.us |accessdate=May 19, 2013}}</ref> The blind bidding system for hosting rights remained in effect for the semifinals and final of the 2012 tournament.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thecup.us/ussf-announces-monumental-format-changes-to-2012-us-open-cup/ |title=USSF announces monumental format changes to 2012 US Open Cup |first=Josh |last=Hakala |date=January 11, 2012 |publisher=TheCup.us |accessdate=May 19, 2013}}</ref>  However, U.S. Soccer announced in 2013 that hosting for all rounds of the tournament would be determined randomly as long as both venues met minimum standards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ussoccer.com/news/lamar-hunt-u-s-open-cup/2013/03/2013-us-lamar-hunt-us-open-cup-release.aspx |title=100th Edition of Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Includes Increased Number of Teams and Prize Money |date=March 5, 2013 |publisher=U.S. Soccer |accessdate=May 19, 2013}}</ref>
