'''Jos<U+00E9> de Sousa Saramago''', <small>[[Order of St. James of the Sword|GCSE]]</small> ([[Pronunciation|pron.]] [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] [{{IPA|<U+0292>u'z<U+025B> s<U+0250><U+027E><U+0250>'magu}}];  born [[November 16]], [[1922]]) is a [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel-laureate]] [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[writer]], [[playwright]] and [[journalist]].  His works commonly present [[subversive]] perspectives on historic events, emphasizing the human factor rather than the official story. Some of his works can also be seen as [[allegories]].

Saramago was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for literature]] in 1998.  He currently lives on [[Lanzarote]] in the [[Canary Islands]], [[Spain]]. 

Saramago was in his mid-fifties before he won international acclaim. It was the 1988 publication of his ''[[Baltasar and Blimunda]]'' that first brought him to the attention of an English-speaking readership. This novel won the Portuguese PEN Club Award. 

Saramago has been a member of the [[Portuguese Communist Party]] since 1969, as well as an [[atheist]] and self-described [[pessimist]].  His views have aroused considerable controversy in Portugal, especially after the publication of ''[[The Gospel According to Jesus Christ]]''. 

Saramago<U+2019>s novels often deal with fantastic [[scenario]]s, such as that in his 1986 novel, ''[[The Stone Raft]]'', where the [[Iberian Peninsula]] breaks off from the rest of Europe and sails about the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. In his 1995 novel, ''[[Blindness (novel)|Blindness]]'', an entire unnamed country is stricken with a mysterious plague, or <U+201C>white blindness<U+201D>.  In his 1984 novel, ''[[The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis]]'' (which won the PEN Award and the ''Independent'' Foreign Fiction Award), Fernando Pessoa<U+2019>s [[Heteronym_(literature)|heteronym]] survives for a year after the poet himself dies.
  
Using such imaginative themes, Saramago succinctly addresses the most serious of subject matter with boundless wit and keen insight. He sprinkles quirky [[segue]]s and asides into his sparsely punctuated but sumptuous narrative thread. His greatest asset as an author is his [[empathy]] for the [[human condition]] and for the [[isolation]] of contemporary urban life.  His characters struggle with their need to connect with one another, form relations, and bond as a community, and with their need for individuality, and to find meaning and dignity outside of political and economic structures. [[Harold Bloom]] has stated that he considers Jos<U+00E9> Saramago the "most gifted novelist alive in the world today".  

==Biography==
===Family history===
Saramago was born into a family of landless peasants in [[Azinhaga]], [[Portugal]], a small village in the province of [[Ribatejo]] some hundred kilometers north-east of [[Lisbon]]. His parents were Jos<U+00E9> de Sousa and Maria de Piedade. "Saramago," a wild herbaceous plant known in English language as [[wild radish]], was his father's family's nickname, which got accidentally incorporated into his name upon registration of his birth. In 1924, Saramago's family moved to [[Lisbon]], where his father started working as a policeman. A few months after the family moved to the capital, his brother Francisco, older by two years, died. Although Saramago was a good pupil, his parents were unable to afford to keep him attending a grammar school, moving him to a technical school at age 12; after finishing school, he worked as a car mechanic for two years. Later he worked as a translator, then as a journalist, and finally as a writer. Saramago married Ilda Reis in 1944.  Their only child, Violante, was born in 1947. Saramago is currently married to Pilar del R<U+00ED>o, from a very powerful [[Barcelona]] family of editors who actively promote his books around the world, and they live on the Spanish island of [[Lanzarote]].

==Style==
Saramago tends to write long sentences, often more than a page long.  He uses periods sparingly, choosing instead a loose flow of clauses joined by commas.  Many of his paragraphs match the length of some authors' chapters. He uses no quotation marks to delimit dialog; when the speaker changes Saramago capitalizes the first letter of the new speaker's clause.  Surprisingly, this style is neither taxing nor inordinately disorienting.  In his novels [[Blindness (novel)|''Blindness'']] and [[The Cave (novel)|''The Cave'']], Saramago sometimes abandons the use of proper nouns; indeed, the difficulty of naming is a recurring theme in his work.
