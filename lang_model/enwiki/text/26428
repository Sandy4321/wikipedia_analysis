The '''Birdman Chinook''' is a family of single and two-place, [[pusher configuration]], high-wing [[ultralight aircraft]] that was first flown on 12 December 1982 and produced by [[Birdman Enterprises]] of [[Edmonton, Alberta]], [[Canada]] starting in 1983.<ref name="Birdman1">Jones, Terry: ''Birdman WT-11 Chinook - A Cabin-Class "Ultra" Lightplane''.

==Design and development==
===Chinook WT-11===
====Design goals====
The first Chinook model introduced was the single-seat WT-11, which entered the market in 1983. The WT-11 was the eleventh aircraft designed by [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]]-born aeronautical engineer [[Vladimir Talanczuk]], a graduate of the [[Poland|Polish]] [[Institute for Aviation Specialists]]. The airfoil was developed by Dr Dave Marsden at the [[University of Alberta]] and is designated as the UA 80/1.<ref name="Birdman1" /><ref name="Janes8788" /><ref name="Hunt1">Hunt, Adam: ''Pilot Report: Chinook 2S''. [[Canadian Owners and Pilots Association]] ''COPA Flight'', October 1999.</ref>

The company design goals for the WT-11 were:<ref name="Birdman1" />

*Good flying characteristics
*Simplicity of construction
*Maximization of aesthetics

Designer Talanczuk stated his own design intentions:

{{cquote|An Ultralight is not only a fun machine, it should also be usable for utility purposes <U+2014><U+2014> training, fishing trips, crop-spraying and even for freight carrying. But an Ultralight should be affordable by many people, so it shouldn<U+2018>t become expensive. The wings, for example, can't be complicated. They should be easy to build and fix.<ref name="Birdman1" /> }}

The WT-11 was designed to comply with the then-new US [[Ultralight aircraft (United States)|FAR 103 ''Ultralight Vehicles'']] category, including the maximum {{convert|254|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} empty weight. With the {{convert|28|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 277]] single cylinder, two stroke powerplant the aircraft has a factory standard empty weight of {{convert|250|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}. The {{convert|35|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 377]] engine became quickly available as an option to give the aircraft more power on floats.<ref name="Cliche" /><ref name="Birdman2" />

In 1987 the WT-11 was redesignated as the ''Chinook 1S'' (1 Seat) by the company to align its nomenclature with the later two-seat ''Chinook 2S'' model.<ref name="Janes8788" />

====Construction====
Talanczuk's design is a high-wing, enclosed cabin monoplane with a high aspect ratio wing of 8.75:1, giving a large wingspan of {{convert|35|ft|m}}. This gives the WT-11 a very low span-loading as well as a light [[wing loading]]. The [[glide ratio]] is 10:1 at {{convert|35|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and minimum sink is 350 fpm (1.78 m/s) at {{convert|32|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. Chinooks have been [[Lift (soaring)|soared]] power-off for long duration flights. The low-drag airframe and high aspect ratio wings gave remarkably good performance on the {{convert|28|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} Rotax 277 engine and the aircraft can cruise at {{convert|50|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} burning 1.5 US gallons per hour (5.7 litres/h) of [[Avgas#Automotive_gasoline|automotive fuel]], giving a range of {{convert|200|mi|km}} on {{convert|5|USgal|l|0|abbr=on}} of fuel.<ref name="Birdman1" /><ref name="Hunt1" />

The aircraft is constructed entirely from [[6061 aluminium alloy|6061-T6 aluminium]] tubing, bolted together with aircraft-grade AN hardware and covered with 3.9 oz/yd<U+00B2> (132 g/m<U+00B2>) [[Polyethylene terephthalate|Dacron]]. The covering includes zippers to facilitate inspection. The structure was static load tested to +6/-3 [[g-force|g]]. The [[fuselage]] is built on a {{convert|4|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} central "spinal" tube that supports the cockpit and the tail surfaces. The cockpit is of a unique pentagonal cross-section that provides a very wide {{convert|38|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} cabin at hip level. The upper cockpit tubing curves down to the aircraft's nose at a ratio of 3:1 to provide a compromise between internal cockpit space and streamlining and gives the Chinook its distinctive profile.<ref name="Birdman1" />

The landing gear is of [[conventional landing gear|conventional]] configuration, with [[Bungee cord|bungee]] suspension, giving good rough field capabilities. The enclosed cabin includes a cargo area that is located on the aircraft's [[Center of mass|center of gravity]], eliminating trim changes as the load varies.<ref name="Birdman1" />

The wing is a two-spar design, supported by a "V" [[strut]] and [[jury strut]]s. The wing has internal lift and drag bracing wires. The [[aileron]]s were originally designed to be "gapless", with the wing's Dacron covering extending over the ailerons. This is sometimes referred to as [[wing warping]], but it differs from that employed on pioneer aircraft. In 1986 the company abandoned the "gapless" aileron design and moved to a more conventional separate aileron. Conversion kits for the existing aircraft fleet were made available.  The WT-11's wings are removable by two people in 15 minutes. The tail surfaces use a similar sealed-gap system, utilizing seamless transitions from the fixed fin and horizontal stabilizer to the movable [[rudder]] and [[elevator (aircraft)|elevator]].<ref name="Birdman1" /><ref name="Janes8788" />

The factory claimed that construction time from the assembly kit was 100 hours for a first time builder. The price for a WT-11 in 1984 was [[Canadian Dollar|Can$]]7995 ([[United States Dollar|US$]]6395).<ref name="Birdman1" />

====Test flying====
[[Flight test|Test flying]] the WT-11 was carried out following the first flight on 12 December 1982 at [[Wizard Lake]], Alberta, by company chief test pilot Dennis Maland.<ref name="Birdman1" /><ref name="Janes8788" />

Initial results showed that with the {{convert|28|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} Rotax 277 engine the aircraft would sustain level flight at low throttle settings and would cruise comfortably at {{convert|50|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. The stall speed was noted as 23-25&nbsp;mph (37<U+2013>41&nbsp;km/h). Maland rated the rudder and elevators as "very responsive" and the ailerons as "less sensitive but good", with roll rates from 45-45 degrees of 3.5 seconds at cruise speed.<ref name="Birdman1" />

Cross wind testing showed the aircraft was controllable in winds of {{convert|20|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} at 45 degrees and {{convert|15|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} at 90 degrees. The aircraft was flown in {{convert|35|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} surface winds safely. Take-off roll was recorded as 100<U+2013>200 feet (31<U+2013>62 m) and distance to clear a {{convert|50|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} obstacle was 200<U+2013>300 feet (62<U+2013>93 m) at {{convert|2500|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level.<ref name="Birdman1" />

Extensive [[Stall (flight)|stall]]  and [[Spin (flight)|spin]] testing was carried out at Wizard Lake on 28 December 1982. Straight-ahead and turning power off stalls resulted in a stable mush condition. Power-on stalls from 30 degrees nose up resulted in a +15 degree nose up stable mush, with no wing drop tendency. A near-vertical pitch resulted in a clean stall, with a smooth pitch forward and recovery to level flight with no wing drop tendency.<ref name="Birdman1" />

Spin testing entered from level flight, snap rolls and turning stalls failed to produce a spin condition as the WT-11 just mushed to level flight. These tests resulted in the company billing the aircraft as "Won't Spin".<ref name="Birdman1" />

The remaining flight testing established the service ceiling as {{convert|15000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} and the absolute ceiling as {{convert|18400|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}. Many dives to the [[V speeds|V<sub>NE</sub>]] of {{convert|85|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} were completed without deformation, [[Aeroelasticity#Flutter|flutter]] or instability. [[Outside loop]]s,  [[Aileron roll|rolls]], snap rolls, stall turns, tail slides and inverted flight were all completed as test procedures, although the company recommended against customers from conducting these manoeuvres.<ref name="Birdman1" />

====Floats====
The WT-11 was tested on [[fiberglass]] floats, mounted close to the fuselage. Company testing showed take-off distances of about {{convert|300|ft|m}} on the water and no need for additional vertical surfaces to be added.<ref name="Birdman1" />

===Chinook 2S===
Building on the success of the single-seat Chinook, Birdman introduced the two place Chinook 2S (''2 seater'') in 1984 and it quickly gained popularity as an ultralight trainer and also as a recreational aircraft. The 2S combined the WT-11's ease of handling, docile stall characteristics and [[Spin (flight)|spin]]-proofness with the reliable [[Rotax 447]] {{convert|42|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and later the  [[Rotax 503]] {{convert|50|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine. One flight review writer noted "The stall was the most benign that I have even seen in any airplane. At full back stick, it just mushes downward slowly with the nose level, at about 200-400 rpm. Releasing the stick returns the Chinook to flying with little altitude loss."<ref name="Cliche" /><ref name="Hunt1" /><ref name="COPA">[[Canadian Owners and Pilots Association]]: ''The COPA Guide to Ultralights - 11th Edition <U+2013> October 2008 ''.</ref>

The construction of the 2S is similar to the WT-11, with the wingspan increased by {{convert|2.0|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} and the same fuselage as the WT-11, with the second seat where the WT-11's baggage area is located. The fuel tank was relocated from the fuselage to both wing struts as aerodynamically-shaped plastic tanks, where they are visible in flight and the fuel level can be quickly determined. Some WT-11s have had these strut tanks installed as well.<ref name="Birdman1" /><ref name="Hunt1" />

In assessing the handling of the 2S one reviewer wrote:

{{cquote| Pitch proved to be neutrally stable <U+2013> it just stayed where it was put. The ailerons were the same. In a bank, the Chinook was just happy to stay at that bank angle, neither rolling itself out nor overbanking. The yaw axis was interesting <U+2013> it remained slightly stable with feet on the pedals, but with feet off and the rudder removed from the fin effect as it floated, the aircraft was unstable. In this mode it slowly diverged from the direction desired, but was easy to control with the feet where they belong on the pedals. Clearly this is an aircraft that requires attention in flight, but I found that the overall effect is that it feels sprightly, not unstable.<ref name="Hunt1" /> }}

The two models of the Chinook built by Birdman were only in production for five years before the company went out of business in late 1987, but close to 700 aircraft were delivered in that time. The kits were made at the [[Aircraft Sales and Parts|Canadian Ultralight Manufacturing]] facility in [[St Paul, Alberta]].<ref name="Cliche" /><ref name="Johnson" /><ref name="JohnsonJan08">{{cite web|url = http://www.bydanjohnson.com/index.cfm?b=3&m=5&i=15|title = Lightplane Offerings From Canada|accessdate = 2009-08-12|last = Johnson|first = Dan|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = January}}</ref>

===Chinook Plus 2===
[[File:ASAP Chinook II+ C-IGOJ photo 1.JPG|thumb|right|ASAP Chinook Plus 2]]
[[File:ASAP Chinook Plus 2 C-IALY 06.JPG|thumb|right|ASAP Chinook Plus 2]]
One of the owners of a Chinook 2S at the time Birdman Enterprises went out of business was Brent Holomis. Seeing the opportunity to step in and provide parts for the fleet he founded [[Aircraft Sales and Parts]] (ASAP) in 1988, in [[Vernon, British Columbia]]. Initially ASAP concentrated on supplying parts, but with assistance from the University of Alberta Holomis redesigned the aircraft. The new model, a two-seater introduced in 1989 was designated the ''Chinook Plus 2'' and incorporated an all new wing of reduced span ({{convert|32|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} versus the 2S's {{convert|37|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}) and lower aspect ratio with a greater number of ribs and covered with [[Ceconite]] in place of untreated Dacron. The wing features [[flaperon]]s. The new model has a completely new landing gear and many other improvements over the 2S and is built by Canadian Ultralight Manufacturing, which ASAP acquired. The Plus 2 retains the strut-mounted fuel tanks introduced on the 2S.<ref name="JohnsonJan08" /><ref name="ASAPHist">{{cite web|url = http://www.ultralight.ca/asaphistory.htm|title = ASAP History|accessdate = 2009-08-10|last = [[Aircraft Sales and Parts]]|authorlink = |year = 2002}}</ref><ref name="AULA">{{cite web|url =http://www.tc.gc.ca/civilaviation/general/CCARCS/advancedullist.htm|title = Listing of Models Eligible to be Registered as Advanced Ultra-Light Aeroplanes (AULA) |accessdate = 2009-08-05|last = [[Transport Canada]]|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = May}}</ref><ref name="Hunt2">Hunt, Adam: ''Flying the ASAP Chinook Plus 2 with Ottawa<U+2019>s Capital Air Sports''. [[Canadian Owners and Pilots Association]] ''COPA Flight'', May 2002.</ref>

The Chinook Plus 2 is available in kit form with a large number of engine options, including the {{convert|50|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 503]], the four-stroke {{convert|60|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[HKS 700E]], the {{convert|64|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 582]] and the {{convert|80|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 912]]. The heavier engines, particularly the Rotax 912, have been noted as changing the aircraft's handling characteristics and making the aircraft less stable in [[Flight dynamics|pitch]] and [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw]].<ref name="Johnson" /><ref name="COPA" /><ref name="Hunt2" />

{{cquote|The Chinook Plus 2 [with the 912 engine] is definitely not a beginner's airplane and [ASAP factory demonstration pilot] Larry [Williams] reports that students take quite a bit of extra time to adapt to its handling. The plane is very responsive to control inputs and exhibits close to neutral static stability in roll. The pitch and yaw axes both exhibit notable negative static stability and the aircraft likes to diverge from straight and level flight in both pitch and yaw. It isn't hard to control, and many aerobatic planes are similarly unstable, but it is an airplane that needs to be flown positively at all times and so would make a less than ideal trainer or plane for a low time pilot.<ref name="COPA" /> }}

With the four-stroke HKS 700E engine the Plus 2 has a top speed af {{convert|90|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and a high cruise of {{convert|80|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, with a {{convert|65|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} economy cruise, burning only about {{convert|2|USgal|l|0|abbr=on}} per hour, giving a five hour endurance with standard tanks. Solo power off stalls are {{convert|35|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and are "mild and uneventful". The aircraft has a very low power off sink rate of about 350 fpm (1.78 m/s).<ref name="Johnson" />

The Plus 2 initially had a gross weight of {{convert|900|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}, but this was progressively increased to its present {{convert|1050|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Hunt2" /><ref name="ASAPSpecs">{{cite web|url = http://www.ultralight.ca/chinspec.htm|title = Specifications|accessdate = 2009-08-12|last = [[Aircraft Sales and Parts]]|authorlink = |year = 2002}}</ref>

Reviewer Dan Johnson writing in ''EAA Sport Pilot & Light Sport Aircraft Magazine'' in January 2008, described the Chinook Plus 2 with the HKS 700E engine:<ref name="JohnsonJan08" />

{{cquote|Though the Chinook's wide cockpit gives it a pudgy appearance from some vantage points, the design slips through the air quite well. It has light and powerful ailerons, which makes it easy to guide through the air. In general, the plane's handling is quite pleasant despite, or perhaps because of, its unorthodox shape.<ref name="JohnsonJan08" /> }}

The factory claims that a first time builder can complete the Chinook Plus 2 in 220 hours of labour.<ref name="KitplanesDec2007" />

==Operational history==
The Chinook WT-11 design won Reserve Grand Champion at [[AirVenture]] in 1983 and again in 1984.<ref name="Janes8687" />

In August 1983 test pilot Dennis Maland flew a WT-11 with the standard [[Rotax 277]] engine to a height of {{convert|18500|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Janes8687" />

In November 1984 Jack Hughes flew a WT-11 across the width of [[Australia]] from [[Orange, New South Wales]] to [[Perth, Western Australia]], in 14 days  and 49 flying hours, a distance of {{convert|2050|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Janes8687" />

In 1993 a {{convert|64|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 582]]-powered Chinook Plus 2 on skis and [[Full Lotus Floats]] was used by the [[National Geographic Society]] in filming a television special about marine mammals in the Canadian Arctic.<ref name="NG">{{cite web|url =http://www.ultralight.ca/articles1.htm|title = Ultralights contribute to Arctic Projects |accessdate = 2009-08-05|last = Williams |first = Glenn|authorlink = |year = 2002}}</ref>
