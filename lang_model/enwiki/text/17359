On July 3, 2000, the Diocese of Laredo was created by His Holiness [[Pope John Paul II]] and made Auxiliary Bishop [[James Anthony Tamayo]], from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston]], the First [[Bishop]] of Laredo.  The Laredo diocese included portions of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Corpus Christi]] and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio]], namely the counties of [[Dimmit County|Dimmit]], [[Jim Hogg County|Jim Hogg]], [[La Salle County, Texas|La Salle]], [[Maverick County|Maverick]], [[Webb County|Webb]], [[Zapata County|Zapata]], and [[Zavala County|Zavala]].
