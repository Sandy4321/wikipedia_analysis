Regarding the album's title, lead singer [[Davey Havok]] said, "Decemberunderground is a time and a place. It is where the cold can huddle together in darkness and isolation."<ref name="bio">{{cite web | title=AFI Official Biography | work=AFI Official Website | url=http://www.afireinside.net/bio/ | accessdate=2006-05-27}}</ref> Three singles have been released from the album thus far. They are "[[Miss Murder]]", "[[Love Like Winter]]" and "[[The Missing Frame]]".

On [[November 7]], [[2006]], the album was re-released on 6 "icy clear" 7" vinyl discs, with all four band members' pictures and "... a very special guest" being [[Smith Puget]], the band's manager, and a poster/lyric sheet.<ref>[http://www.cinderblock.com/wc.dll?WebStore%7ERViewItem%7EAFI%7EAFI-BOX1%7ESID=11]</ref>

AFI was on tour in support of the album since [[April]] of [[2006]]. They recently played [[Live Earth]], and will be playing Download Fest in October. It is noted that Download Fest will be the last show in support of Decemberunderground, as Havok and Puget want to focus on [[Blaqk Audio]].

==Release==
The single, "Miss Murder", was supposed to have premiered on [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]] and [[KITS-FM|LIVE 105]] on [[April 13]], [[2006]], but due to the fact that the thirty-second clip that KROQ aired on [[April 11]] had such an overwhelming response of people requesting to hear it over and over again, [[Interscope Records]] gave permission for the radio stations to play the entire song, and those who tuned in on their radios and online across the globe got to hear it early. The full track listing of the album was announced on [[April 25]], [[2006]].<ref name="aversion">{{cite web | title=AFI Reveals Track Listing | work=Aversion.com Music News | url=http://www.aversion.com/news/news_article.cfm?news_id=6399 | accessdate=2006-05-27}}</ref>

When fans preordered this CD at special pre-listening events, they received a [[Compact Disc|CD]] including "Miss Murder" and "Don't Change". "Don't Change" is a cover of an [[INXS]] song. 

The first pressing of the CD in North America contains "limited edition artwork" of a single portrait of one of the members of AFI, with a portrait of the entire band on the reverse of the insert, which serves as the CD cover, hiding the portrait on the CD booklet cover.<ref>http://www.afireinside.net/news/default.aspx/nid/1989</ref>

==Fan and critical responses==
There has been some disagreement over the band's departure from [[hardcore punk]] in the direction of a more [[synthpop]] and [[New Wave music|New Wave]]-oriented sound. Many fans hate the band's "New Sound". This album has a lot more techno, and industrial elements, which are evident in the songs "37mm" and "Summer Shudder". The album has received mixed reviews,  For example, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' awarded the album three stars out of five, a drop from the four-star album ''[[Sing the Sorrow]]''. ''Rolling Stone'' said ''Decemberunderground'' feels like "something isn't right in the world of AFI" due to their turn towards a more pop-based musical structure "that would be at home on the soundtrack to the next ''[[Spider-Man]]'' movie".<ref name = "Rolling Stone">{{cite web | author=Strauss, Neil| year=2006| title=Rolling Stone : Decemberunderground : Review | format=HTML | work=Rolling Stone | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/10483520/review/10500531/Decemberunderground | accessdate=2006-06-17}}</ref> However, [[All Music Guide]] disagreed, saying the "core of AFI's sound never strays too far from what listeners have grown to love about them in the first place." This album earned four stars out of five from All Music Guide.<ref name = "allmusic">{{cite web | author=Apar, Corey| year=2006| title=allmusic ((( Decemberunderground > Review ))): | format=HTML | work=allmusic.com | url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:25j20r2aw48x~T1 | accessdate=2006-06-17}}</ref>

==Miscellaneous==
* If the track "[[Prelude 12/21]]" is rewound past 00:00 (to -00:20), a hidden introduction to the track can be found.<ref name="yahoo">{{cite web|url = http://music.yahoo.com/video/default.asp?vid=32425607 |title = Yahoo Music Entry| accessdate = 2006-11-05}}</ref>

* Track 7's full name is "Affliction and Then I'll be Home". This is because the two songs "Affliction" and "Then I'll be Home" share the 7th track of the album. "Affliction" ends at 3:37 and, after a brief silence, "Then I'll be Home" begins playing. Before the album's release, leaked advance copies had "Affliction" play for 3:37, then play the next track, "[[The Missing Frame]]". "Then I'll Be Home" was the thirteenth track, following "Endlessly, She Said", and was at the time an untitled outro.

* The video of "[[Miss Murder]]" was re-released in a 'Director's Cut' version, which included "Prelude 12/21" and footage of Miss Murder drawing, folding, and placing in her mouth, the piece of paper which Davey takes from his own mouth and unfolds, revealing the three ''Decemberunderground'' rabbits in their circular formation.<ref name="yahoo">{{cite web|url = http://music.yahoo.com/video/default.asp?vid=32425607 |title = Yahoo Music Entry| accessdate = 2006-11-05}}</ref>

* ''Decemberunderground'' is the first album to not contain a hidden track at the end of the album's last track since ''[[Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes]]''.
