'''Trevone''' is a seaside [[village]] near [[Padstow]] in [[Cornwall]], [[England]], [[UK]]. It is made up of one long road leading down to the beach surrounded by houses, with few branches off. It has a very high proportion of "[[bed and breakfast]]" guest houses. It has a very few shops by the seaside and a post office / general store halfway between the top of the hill and the beach. The beach itself has been rated to have very high cleanliness.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

A local curiosity is one of the cliffs next to the sea which has a large [[Blowhole (geology)|blowhole]] in it leading directly down to the sea.

In the beginning of 2007 Trevone Bay was used as the setting for the new Renault Clio Ripcurl advert, featuring two surfers contemplating going into the sea.
