==Geography==

Fed by four alpine glaciers, Fox Glacier falls {{convert|2,600|m|ft|abbr=on}} on its 13&nbsp;km journey from the [[Southern Alps]] down to the coast, with it having the distinction of being one of the few glaciers to end among lush rainforest only {{convert|300|m|ft}} above sea level. Although retreating throughout most of the last 100 years, it has been advancing since 1985. In 2006 the average rate of advance was about a metre a week.<ref name="HeraldA">{{cite news

The outflow of the glacier forms the [[Fox River, Westland|Fox River]]. During the last [[ice age]], its ice reached beyond the present coastline, and the glacier left behind many [[moraine]]s during its retreat. [[Lake Matheson]] formed as a [[Kettle (landform)|kettle lake]] within one of these.<ref name="DOC">[http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-visit/west-coast/glaciers/fox-glacier-area/features/ Fox Glacier area] (from the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|DOC]] website.

==Tourism==

===Overview===
Like the nearby [[Franz Josef Glacier]], it is one of the most accessible glaciers in the world, with its terminal face an easy walk from Fox Glacier village/Weheka. It is a major tourist attraction and about 1000 people daily visit it during high tourist season.<ref name="HeraldA"/> Though people are told not to, some go beyond the barriers and climb without guides onto the glacier, whose rapid advance creates dangers of sudden ice and rockfalls.<ref name="HeraldA"/> 

Fox Glacier township/Weheka, 6&nbsp;km away from the glacier,<ref name="DOC"/> functions mainly as a service centre for tourists, though it also services the local farming community, which had been its main focus until the 1990s (though tourism started as early as the late 1920s). The approximate township site had been gazetted as early as 1866.<ref name="HOTEL"/> [[Bruce Bay]] is 46&nbsp;km to the south-west of the township, and [[Franz Josef, New Zealand|Franz Josef]] is 23&nbsp;km north-east. [[New Zealand State Highway 6|State Highway 6]] runs through the town.<ref>{{cite book|title=Reed New Zealand Atlas|year=2004|isbn=0-7900-0952-8|author=Peter Dowling (editor)|publisher=Reed Books|nopp=true|page=map 76}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Geographic Atlas of New Zealand|year=2005|isbn=1-877333-20-4|author=Roger Smith, GeographX|publisher=Robbie Burton|nopp=true|page=map 173}}</ref>

The population was 375 in the [[New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings|2006 Census]], an increase of 117 from 2001.<ref>{{NZ Quickstats|3585313}}</ref>

===Accidents on the Glacier===
Two Australian tourists, Ashish Miranda and Akshay Miranda, were killed on 8 January 2009 when more than 100 tonnes of ice fell on them. They were not part of a guided group and had crossed safety barriers and walked approximately 500 metres to the terminal face to take photos.<ref name=nzh09/>

Ashish's body was recovered shortly after the accident. At the time, it was thought by rescuers that Akshay might have to be left under the ice permanently. However his body was recovered a week later, 10&nbsp;km downstream from the accident.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10552048|title=Body of second brother recovered from Fox Glacier |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald|date=15 January 2009}}</ref>

===Accidents at the airport===
A Cessna crash on landing at [[Fox Glacier Aerodrome]] in September 2008 left three people hospitalised.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/2059215/423466.html

Nine people, including four international tourists, died in a [[2010 New Zealand Fletcher FU24 crash|plane crash]] 4 September 2010 when the plane, carrying a party of skydivers and tourists, crashed at the end of the runway at Fox Glacier, near the town.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703946504575470672177074334.html?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=Nine Dead in New Zealand Crash |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=4 September 2010 | first=Rebecca | last=Howard}}</ref>
