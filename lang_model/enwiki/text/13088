'''Mickie James''' (born [[August 31]], [[1979]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] currently signed to [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] wrestling on its ''[[WWE Raw|RAW]]'' brand. 

==Early career==
Mickie James made her professional debut in the summer of 1999 as a ring valet for KYDA Pro Wrestling in [[Manassas, Virginia]]. She started out [[manager (professional wrestling)|managing]] some of the most popular stars in the promotion such as [[Steve Corino]] and [[Tom Laughlin (wrestler)|Tommy Dreamer]], but eventually found herself being drawn into [[feud (professional wrestling)|feuds]] with other wrestlers and their valets and managers. Eventually Mickie chose to step into the ring as a wrestler herself. 
Although most of Mickie's matches have been against women, some of her most memorable matches would be against men. She scored her first big win in a match against Sean Lei. 

Laree's career has gone through many promotions. In late 1999 she expanded out to other promotions including all-female [[professional wrestling promotion|promotions]] Beautiful Babes of Wrestling (BBOW) and Professional Girl Wrestling Association (PGWA). She probably made her largest impact wrestling for [[Maryland Championship Wrestling]], where she engaged in several long-running feuds. In January 2001, Mickie made her debut appearance for two new women's promotions, Dangerous Women of Wrestling (DWOW) and [[Women's Extreme Wrestling]] (WEW). Both promotions worked together to promote women's wrestling with a hardcore edge, and WEW had regular monthly [[pay-per-view]] matches. James' feuds in WEW include matches against "Prime Time" Amy Lee, Dee-Dee Venturi, a re-ignition of her feud with Candie from MCW, and the start of a new series of feuds with "Simply Luscious" [[Ronnie Stephens]]. Her matches against Stephens stretched to many [[independent circuit|independent]] promotions in the [[Northeastern United States|northeast]]. She had a [[kayfabe]] sister called [[Valentina (wrestler)|Valentina Laree]] as part of an angle during her indie days (when Mickie's ring name was Alexis Laree).

==Total Nonstop Action Wrestling==
[[Image:alexis-laree-in-tna.jpg|left|125px|thumb|As Alexis Laree in TNA Wrestling.]]
Mickie, as Alexis Laree, debuted in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|NWA:TNA]] on their second-ever [[Pay per view|PPV]] in late 2002 as part of the all-women's [[Lingerie]] [[Professional wrestling match types#battle royal|Battle Royal]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/tna/020626.html NWA:TNA PPV - 26th June 2002 Results]</ref>. However, she wasn't prominently featured until the [[March 26]], [[2003]] PPV, when she helped out [[Jonathan Figueroa|The Amazing Red]] in a mixed tag-team match against [[David Cash|Kid Kash]] and [[Stephanie Finochio|Trinity]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/tna/030326.html NWA:TNA PPV - 26th March 2003 Results]</ref>. Two weeks later, the two women had a match against each other. It ended prematurely when James was dragged away by [[Scott Levy|Raven]], who had recently debuted. Later that evening, it was revealed that James had joined Raven's new group, [[Raven's Nest#The Gathering|The Gathering]], which would later be expanded with the addition of [[Brian Wohl|Julio Dinero]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/tna/030409.html NWA:TNA PPV - 9th April 2003 Results]</ref>. 

The Gathering was a smaller part of Vince Russo's "[[Sports Entertainment Xtreme]]" (S.E.X.) stable. With Raven assuming some control of the group, they immediately focused on Raven's attempt to take the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] away from champion [[Jeff Jarrett]]. Over the next few weeks The Gathering broke away as James and Dinero helped Raven win his matches and would even start engaging Jeff Jarrett himself. On [[April 16]], [[2003]] Jeff Jarrett was challenged to a [[Professional wrestling match types#Clockwork Orange House of Fun match|Clockwork Orange House of Fun Match]] against James and Dinero, marking the first time a woman had ever participated in this dangerous style of cage match<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/tna/030416.html NWA:TNA PPV - 16th April 2003 Results]</ref>. Jarrett powerbombed James from the top rope and through a table with Dinero laying on top. However, Raven ran in, attacked Jarrett with his "Raven Effect" DDT, and put Dinero on top for the pin. Raven would lose his first-ever NWA World Heavyweight title match against Jarrett two weeks later. 

The Gathering arose again shortly thereafter, starting a feud with [[James Mitchell (wrestler)|Father James Mitchell]] and his [[Disciples of the New Church]] faction. On [[July 30]], [[2003]] The Gathering lost a Clockwork Orange House of Fun Match against The New Church. Mickie again participated in this match, making her the only woman to participate in it twice. At the end of the match, she was hit in the face by a fireball from Mitchell and would not be seen on NWA/TNA broadcasts again. 

On [[August 18]], [[2003]] James was offered a developmental contract with [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]. Despite some reports, she was not replaced in The Gathering by [[CM Punk]]; they were actually both in The Gathering at the same time, she was just shifted out of it.

==Ohio Valley Wrestling==
October 2003 would mark a new calling for Mickie, however. After appearing on several PPVs for NWA-TNA, she caught the attention of [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]. She was signed to a developmental contract and immediately sent to [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW) in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] to begin training.

In early 2004 she started making television appearances for the OVW promotion, still using the ring name "Alexis Laree", she was regularly included in [[angle (professional wrestling)|storylines]] including feuds with [[Jillian Hall]], [[Melina Perez|Melina]], [[Trudi Denucci]], [[Nikita Fink]], [[Passion (wrestler)|Passion]], [[Linda Miles|Shaniqua]], [[Melissa Coates]], [[Vanessa Harding|Ms. Blu]], [[Beth Phoenix]], & [[Shelly Martinez|Shelly]]. 

In summer 2005 she and [[CM Punk]] were reunited for the first time since [[Raven's Nest|The Gathering]]. They were briefly reunited as a new team in WWE, with James serving as Punk's valet for a taping of [[WWE Heat]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] on [[July 25]], [[2005]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/050725.html RAW - 25th July 2005 Results]</ref>. The match was not aired, for conflicting reasons. Plans to team the two together and bring them to TV were abandoned. Prior to this, she also briefly appeared on television for [[Memphis Wrestling]] in April 2005.

==World Wrestling Entertainment==
===2005-2006===
[[Image:MickieAshley.JPG|thumb|right|225px|Mickie with [[Ashley Massaro|Ashley]] tied up.]]She made her debut on the main roster during the October 10, 2005 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|RAW]]'' under her real name: Mickie James, and was billed as an obsessed fan of [[Trish Stratus]]. She came to the aid of [[Ashley Massaro|Ashley]] and Stratus following an attack by [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/051010.html RAW - 10th October 2005 Results]</ref>. In her first televised match a week later <U+2014> a tag team match with Ashley Massaro and [[Trish Stratus]] against Victoria, [[Candice Michelle]], and [[Torrie Wilson]] <U+2014> ended with James being pinned by Victoria<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/051017.html RAW - 17th October 2005 Results]</ref>. Reflecting her idolation of the then-Women's Champion, her behaviour in the coming weeks would take a turn for the bizzare. She dressed up as 'Trish Stratus' (complete with a crudely constructed replica of the Women's Championship strap) during a Diva Halloween Costume Contest on ''RAW''<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/051031.html RAW - 31st October 2005 Results]</ref>. She also began utilizing Stratus' established finishing moves - the [[Roundhouse Kick|Chick Kick]] (re-dubbed the "Mick Kick") and the [[Professional_wrestling_aerial_techniques#Springboard_bulldog|Stratusfaction]] to win her matches. James even helped Stratus to win the "Fulfill Your Fantasy" [[Diva (professional wrestling)|Diva]] [[battle royal]] for the [[WWE Women's Championship]] during the [[WWE Cyber Sunday#2005|Taboo Tuesday 2005]] PPV, by eliminating herself as she eliminated Victoria<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/tabootuesday05.html Taboo Tuesday 2005 Results]</ref>.

On the [[December 12]], 2005 edition ''RAW'' Mickie James defeated [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]] with her debuting [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Tornado_DDT|Tornado DDT]] finisher to receive a match against Stratus for the [[WWE Women's Championship]] at ''[[WWE New Years Revolution#2006|New Year's Revolution 2006]]''<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/051212.html RAW - 12th December 2005 Results]</ref>.

Subsequently, James developed a lesbian crush on Trish Stratus, frequently getting her into various compromising situations, such as kissing her beneath the mistletoe<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/051226.html RAW - 26th December 2005 Results]</ref> and interrupting her shower<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060102.html RAW - 2nd January 2006 Results]</ref>. Following her pinfall loss to Stratus for the [[WWE Women's Championship]] at ''New Year's Revolution''<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/neewyearsrevolution06.html New Year's Revolution 2006 Results]</ref>, James commented that it "felt like silk" when her skin touched Stratus's. The match between them was highly praised.

Hints at James' [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] turn began after she attacked fan favorite Ashley Massaro during a tag-team match<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060123.html RAW - 23rd January 2006 Results]</ref>. At the ''[[Royal Rumble (2006)|Royal Rumble 2006]]'', James faced Ashley in a match where Stratus acted as the [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|Special Guest Referee]]. Before the match, Mickie confessed her "love" for Stratus, and after her win, attempted to celebrate with her hero, but Stratus did not cooperate<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/royalrumble06.html Royal Rumble 2006 Results]</ref>. 

In February, Mickie tried to put the moves on Stratus' boyfriend Jack. However, she claimed to be a victim of an [[sexual harassment|unwanted advance]] by Jack even though she was the aggressor<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060213.html RAW - 13th February 2006 Results]</ref>. Subsequently, Mickie provocatively licked an oversized photograph of a lingerie-clad Stratus on television. Stratus confronted James and asked that they "[[personal space|maintain their space]]." On the March 18 ''[[WWE Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', James agreed to give Stratus her space. The two shook hands as though they were parting ways, but James attempted to hug and kiss her partner. James then attacked Stratus after she pushed her away, thus completing her heel turn<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/snme/060318.html Saturday Night's Main Event - 18th March 2006 Results]</ref>. In March, it was revealed that James had a shrine to Trish, which included dozens of pictures of Trish with her eyes cut out. James would continue to play mind games with Stratus for several weeks stating that even though "I (James) admired Trish for so long" at ''[[WrestleMania 22]]'' she had two goals, to take the [[WWE Women's Championship]] and also to see Trish's destruction<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060327.html RAW - 27th March 2006 Results]</ref>.
[[Image:Mickiejames.JPG|thumb|left|Mickie at [[WWE Saturday Night's Main Event]]]]
At ''WrestleMania 22'', James defeated Trish Stratus following a Mick Kick. During the match, despite the fact that James was the heel, the fans frequently cheered for her, and booed Stratus whenever she hit an offensive move<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/wrestlemania22.html WrestleMania 22 Results]</ref>. 

On the April 3, 2006 edition of ''RAW'', James came down to the ring dressed as Trish, complete with a blonde wig, Stratus' wrestling outfit, and theme music that began with Stratus' laughter as in Stratus' theme music<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060403.html RAW - 3rd April 2006 Results]</ref>. Stratus responded by dressing and acting like James the next week in an attempt to play mind games with her rival<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060410.html RAW - 10th April 2006 Results]</ref>. James was disqualified in her WWE Women's Championship match vs. Stratus at ''[[WWE Backlash#2006|Backlash 2006]]''. This was rumoured not to be the original finish for the match, but Trish sustained a dislocated shoulder, and thus the match had to be cut short<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/backlash06.html Backlash 2006 Results]</ref>.

On the [[May 8]], [[2006]] edition of ''RAW'',  following James' attack on [[Maria Kanellis|Maria]], an unknown woman confronted James. The women was removed by security, but it seemes as though Mickie knew her because she shouted at her as she left the arena<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060508.html RAW - 8th May 2006 Results]</ref>. The woman <U+2014> later revealed as [[Beth Phoenix]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060515.html RAW - 15th May 2006 Results]</ref> <U+2014> attacked James on ''RAW'' for several weeks, repeatedly shouting "I am not going to let you get away with what you did to me!"<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060522.html RAW - 22th May 2006 Results]</ref> This feud was cut short, after Phoenix injured her jaw in a match against [[Lisa Varon|Victoria]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060605.html RAW - 5th June 2006 Results]</ref>. 

Mickie James lost her Women's Championship on the [[August 14]], [[2006]] edition of ''RAW'' to [[Amy Dumas|Lita]] after she hit Mickie with the belt while Edge distracted the referee<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060814.html RAW - 14th August 2006 Results]</ref>. Mickie's rematch occured on the [[August 28]], [[2006]] edition of ''RAW'', but she once again lost to Lita after she used the ropes for leverage<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060828.html RAW - 28th August 2006 Results]</ref>. Mickie James was defeated by Trish Stratus in Stratus' last match on September 11 at [[Madison Square Garden]], where both hugged each other following the match<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/060911.html RAW - 11th September 2006 Results]</ref>. Because she was retiring, Trish Stratus vacated the title<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/unforgiven06.html Unforgiven 2006 Results]</ref>, which led to a [[WWE Women's Championship|Women's Championship Tournament]] to determine the new champion. In the tournament, James defeated both Victoria<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/061002.html RAW - 2nd October 2006 Results]</ref> and [[Melina Perez|Melina]]<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/061023.html RAW - 23rd October 2006 Results]</ref>, before losing to Lita at ''[[WWE Cyber Sunday#2006|Cyber Sunday 2006]]''<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/cybersunday06.html Cyber Sunday 2006 Results]</ref>. Mickie and Lita would fight in a series of matches where Lita took an unfair advantage over Mickie by having her legs shackled together<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/061113.html RAW - 13th November 2006 Results]</ref>, one arm tied behind her back<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/061106.html RAW - 6th November 2006 Results]</ref>, or being blindfolded<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/061120.html RAW - 20th November 2006 Results]</ref>. At ''[[Survivor Series (2006)|Survivor Series 2006]]'', James won her second Women's Championship by pinning Lita in Lita's retirement match<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/survivorseries06.html Survivor Series 2006 Results]</ref>.

===2007===
On the [[November 27]], [[2006]] episode of ''RAW'', Victoria won a Diva Battle Royal to face James at ''[[New Year's Revolution#2007|New Year's Revolution 2007]]'' for the WWE Women's Title<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/061127.html RAW - 27th November 2006 Results]</ref>. After several weeks of feuding, James pinned Victoria at ''New Year's Revolution'', successfully defending her Women's Championship<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/wweppv/newyearsrevolution06.html New Year's Revolution 2006 Results]</ref>. [[Image:MickieWWEWomensChamp.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Mickie as [[WWE Women's Championship|Women's Champion]]]]
Following ''New Year's Revolution'', Melina would become the #1 contender for the WWE Women's Championship<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/070129.html RAW - 29th January 2007 Results]</ref>. For a brief time, Mickie would align herself with [[Super Crazy]] against Melina and [[Johnny Nitro]]. On the [[February 5]],[[2007]] episode of ''RAW'', Mickie defeated Melina to retain the Women's Championship<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/070205.html RAW - 5th February 2007 Results]</ref>, but two weeks later, she lost her championship to Melina<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/070219.html RAW - 19th February 2007 Results]</ref>.  On the March 5th edition of ''RAW'', Mickie James got a rematch, where she faced in the first ever Women's Championship [[Professional wrestling matches#Falls Count Anywhere match|Falls Count Anywhere Match]]. Melina pinned Mickie after she attempted to do a [[Professional wrestling throws#Hurricanrana|hurricanrana]] from the top rope, which Melina blocked, causing James to fall on her neck and almost causing a serious injury<ref>[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/results/raw/070305.html RAW - 5th March 2007 Results]</ref>.<!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD WEEK BY WEEK EVENTS, RUMORS OR SPECULATION.
