'''''Limbo''''' is a [[Puzzle game|puzzle]]-[[Platform game|platform]] video game and the premiere title of independent [[Denmark|Danish]] game developer [[Playdead Studios]]. The game was released in July 2010 on [[Xbox Live Arcade]], and was later re-released as part of a retail game pack along with ''[[Trials HD]]'' and ''[['Splosion Man]]'' in April 2011. ''Limbo'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[sidescroller]], incorporating a [[physics engine|physics system]] that governs environmental objects and the [[player character]]. The player guides an unnamed boy through dangerous environments and traps as the boy searches for his sister. The developer built the game's puzzles expecting the player to fail before finding the correct solution. Playdead called the style of play "trial and death", and used visually gruesome imagery for the boy's deaths to steer the player from unworkable solutions.

The game is presented primarily in [[monochrome|monochromatic]] black-and-white tones, using lighting, film grain effects and minimal ambient sounds to create an eerie atmosphere often associated with the horror genre. Journalists praised the dark presentation, describing the work as comparable to ''[[film noir]]'' and [[German Expressionism]]. Based on its aesthetics, reviewers classified ''Limbo'' as an example of "[[art game|video game as art]]". 

''Limbo'' received positive reviews, but was criticized for its minimal story; some critics found the open-ended work to have deeper meaning that tied well with the game's mechanics, while others believed the lack of significant plot and abrupt ending detracted from the game. A common point of criticism from reviewers was that the high cost of the game relative to its short length might deter players from purchasing the title, but some reviews proposed that ''Limbo'' had an ideal length. The title was the third-highest selling game on the Xbox Live Arcade service in 2010, generating around $7.5 million in revenue. The title won several awards from industry groups after its release, and was named as one of the top games for 2010 by several publications.

==Plot==
The primary character in ''Limbo'' is a nameless boy who awakens in the middle of a forest on the "edge of hell" (the game's title is taken from the Latin ''[[wikt:limbus|limbus]]'', meaning "edge").<ref name="gamasutra interview"/> The boy seeks his missing sister, and encounters only a few human characters that  attack or run away from him.<ref name="ign preview">{{cite web | url = http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/107/1073457p1.html | title = IGF-Nominated Limbo Headed to XBLA | first = Daemon | last = Hatfield | date = 2010-03-02 | accessdate = 2010-07-21 | publisher = [[IGN]] }}</ref><ref name="rps interview"/><ref name="eurog review">{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/limbo-review | title = Limbo | first = John | last= Teti | date = 2010-07-19 | accessdate=  2010-07-21 | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> Once during the journey, the boy catches a glimpse of a female character, but she vanishes before he can reach her.<ref name="avclub review">{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/articles/limbo,43441/ | title = Limbo | first= Christian | last = Williams | date = 2010-07-26 | accessdate = 2010-07-29 | publisher = [[A.V.

==Gameplay==
[[File:LimboGame1.jpg|thumb|right|A pre-release development screenshot, showing the boy crossing a dangerous chasm on a rope bridge. The game's art style and presentation have been consistent through the game's development cycle.]]
The player controls the boy for the entire game. As is typical of most two-dimensional [[platform game]]s, the player can make the boy run left or right on the screen, jump, climb up short ledges or up and down ladders and ropes, and push or pull objects. The game is presented through dark, greyscale graphics and with minimalist ambient sounds, creating an eerie, haunting environment.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://uk.xboxlive.ign.com/articles/107/1077308p1.html | title = GDC 10: Limbo Hands-on | first = Greg | last = Miller | date =2010-03-12 | accessdate = 2010-07-21 | publisher = [[IGN]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/215856/limbo/ | title = http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/215856/limbo/ | title = Limbo | first = McKinley | last = Noble | date =2010-07-19 | accessdate = 2010-08-30 | publisher = [[GamePro]] }}</ref> The dark visuals also hide numerous environmental and physical traps, such as [[bear trap]]s on the forest floor or monsters in the shadows that will attempt to kill the boy. These monsters include a giant spider and worms that dig into the boy's brain and force him to travel in one direction until the worms are killed.<ref name="ign jensen"/> 

The second half of the game features puzzles and traps involving more mechanical aspects, such as machinery, electromagnetism, and gravity. Many of these traps are not apparent until triggered, often killing the boy. Should this happen, the player restarts the game at the last checkpoint; there is no limit on how many times this can occur. However, the player can often avoid these traps and then use them later, such as using a bear trap to clamp onto an animal carcass at the end of a rope and pulling it taut, allowing the boy to climb up to a ledge that was otherwise out of reach.  Because these traps are not known until the player activates them, the developers called the game a "trial and death" game, as the player will likely encounter numerous deaths before they solve each puzzle and complete the game.<ref name="ign review">{{cite web | url = http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/110/1106885p1.html | title = Limbo Review | first = Daemon | last = Hatfield |  date = 2010-07-19 | accessdate = 2010-07-21 | publisher = [[IGN]] }}</ref> Many deaths are animated with images of dismemberment or beheading of the boy, but an optional gore filter blacks out the screen instead of showing these deaths.<ref name="globeandmail review"/><ref name="g4tv review"/> Game [[Xbox Live#Gamerscore|achievements]] (optional in-game goals) include finding hidden insect eggs and completing the game with five or fewer deaths.<ref name="torontosun interview"/>

According to Playdead partner Dino Patti and lead designer Jeppe Carlsen, Playdead's game director, Arnt Jensen, conceived ''Limbo'' around 2004.<ref name="gamasutra interview">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/27043/Road_To_The_IGF_Limbos_Dino_Patti.php | title = Road To The IGF: Limbo's Dino Patti | first = Leigh | last = Alexander | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date = 2010-02-18 | accessdate =2010-07-22 }}</ref><ref name="rps interview">{{cite web | url = http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2010/02/22/igf-factor-2010-limbo/ | title= IGF Factor 2010: Limbo | first = Kieron | last = Gillon | date =2010-02-22 | accessdate = 2010-07-22 | publisher = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}</ref> At that time, as a concept artist at [[IO Interactive]], Jensen became dissatisfied with the increasingly corporate nature of the company. He had sketched a "mood image" of a "secret place" to get ideas, and the result, similar to the backgrounds of the final game, inspired Jensen to expand on it.<ref name="ign jensen">{{cite web | url = http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/112/1120477p1.html | title = How Limbo Came To Life | first = Michael | last = Thompsen | date = 2010-09-14 | accessdate = 2010-09-19 | publisher = [[IGN]]}}</ref> Jensen initially tried on his own to program the game in [[Visual Basic]] around 2004, but found he needed more help and proceeded to create an art style trailer by 2006.<ref name="exclaim patti"/> He had only intended to use the trailer as a means to recruit a programmer to help him,<ref name="gamasutra interview"/> but the video attracted much interest in the project from across the Internet, eventually leading him to meet with Patti, who was also dissatisfied with his job.<ref name="ign jensen"/> Their collaboration led to the founding of Playdead Studios.<ref name="ign jensen"/> Although Patti helped in the first few months with programming, he realised that the project was much larger than what the two of them could handle, and Patti developed the business around the game's expanded development.<ref name="ign jensen"/> 

Initial development was funded personally by Jensen and Patti along with Danish government grants, including funding from the Nordic Game Program, while large investors were sought later in the development cycle.<ref name="ign jensen"/> Jensen and Patti did not want to commit to major publishers, preferring to retain full creative control in developing the title.<ref name="rps interview"/> Jensen originally planned to release ''Limbo'' as a free Microsoft Windows title, but by this point, Jensen and Patti decided to make the game a retail title.<ref name="ign jensen"/>

Playdead chose to ignore outside advice from investors and critics during development, such as the addition of multiplayer play and adjustable difficulty levels, and extending the game's length. According to Patti, Playdead felt these changes would break the integrity of Jensen's original vision.<ref name="torontosun interview"/> Numerous iterations of the game took place during a two-and-a-half year development cycle, including changes Jensen had demanded to polish the title.<ref name="torontosun interview"/> Patti stated that they "trashed 70%" of the content they had developed, due to it not fitting in well with the context of the game.<ref name="gamasutra interview"/> The core development team size was about 8 programmers, expanding to 16 at various stages with freelancers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2010/03/igf_finalist_limbo_to_release.php | title = IGF Finalist Limbo To Release On XBLA This Summer | publisher = [[Game Set Watch]] | date =2010-03-10 | accessdate = 2010-07-22 | first = Eric | last= Caoili }}</ref> Playdead developed the design tools for ''Limbo'' in [[Visual Studio]]; Patti commented they would likely seek third-party applications for their next project given the challenges in creating their own technology.<ref name="gamasutra interview"/> 

''Limbo'' was released on 21 July 2010 on the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service, as the first title in the yearly "Summer of Arcade" promotion.<ref name="bostonherald">{{cite web | url = http://news.bostonherald.com/entertainment/lifestyle/view/20100726summer_games_dark_limbo_provides_cool_action/srvc=home&position=also | title = Summer games: Dark <U+2018>Limbo<U+2019> provides cool action | first = Garrett | last = Martin | work = [[Boston Herald]] | date = 2010-07-26 | accessdate = 2010-07-26 }}</ref> Although the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB) had listed entries for ''Limbo'' for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] platforms, Playdead confirmed that this was a mistake on ESRB's part, and that they had no plans for the game on these systems.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3179556 | title=  Developer Playdead Says Limbo Not Coming to PS3, PC | first = Kris | last = Pigna | date = 2010-05-29 | accessdate = 2010-07-22 | publisher =  [[1UP.com]] }}</ref> According to producer Mads Wibroe, part of their decision not to release for the Windows platform was to avoid issues with [[software piracy]], something they could control on the Xbox 360.<ref name="escapist pax">{{cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/99483-PAX-East-2010-Hands-On-Limbo | title = PAX East 2010 Hands On: Limbo | first = Logan | last = Westbrook | date =2001-03-26 | accessdate = 2010-07-23 | publisher = ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' }}</ref> Patti stated that staying exclusive with the Xbox platform was an assurance that they would be able to recoup their investment in the game's development. Patti affirmed that ''Limbo'' will not be released for another console, but that their next game, already in development as of October 2010, may see wider release.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vg247.com/2010/10/11/limbo-devs-working-on-new-ip/ | title = Limbo devs working on new IP | first = Johnny | last = Cullen | date = 2010-10-11 | accessdate = 2010-10-11 | publisher = [[VG247]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2010/10/11/limbo-creators-working-on-new-ip/ | title = Limbo creators working on new IP |  first = Mike | last = Schramm | publisher = [[Joystiq]] | date = 2010-10-11 | accessdate = 2010-10-11 }}</ref> However, in June 2011, users found that a trailer for ''Limbo'' appeared on the [[Steam (software)|Steam software service]], which journalists such as ''[[PC Gamer]]'' took as a preliminary sign that a Microsoft Windows version would be released.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/06/06/limbo-trailer-on-steam-hints-at-pc-release/ | title = Limbo trailer on Steam hints at PC release | first = Tom | last = Senior | date = 2011-06-06 | accessdate = 2011-06-06 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>

===Story, art and music direction===
From the game's inception, Jensen set out three goals for the final ''Limbo'' product. The first goal was to create a specific mood and art style. Jensen wanted to create an aesthetic for the game without resorting to highly-detailed three-dimensional models, and instead directed the art towards a minimalistic style to allow the development to focus its attention on the gameplay.<ref name="exclaim patti">{{Cite web | url = http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=147&csid2=807&fid1=49037 | title = Arty For the Ages | first =  Joshua | last = Ostroff | date = September 2010 | accessdate = 2010-08-24 | work = [[Exclaim!]] }}</ref> Jensen's second goal was to only require two additional controls&mdash;jumping and grabbing&mdash;outside of the normal left-and-right movement controls, to keep the game easy to play. Finally, the finished game was to present no tutorial text to the player, requiring players to learn the game's mechanics on their own.<ref name="gamasutra gdc">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/29934/GDC_Europe_Limbos_Carlsen_On_Making_Players_Your_Worst_Enemy_And_Your_Best_Friend.php | title = GDC Europe: Limbo's Carlsen On Making Players Your Worst Enemy And Your Best Friend | first = Brendon | last= Sheffield | date= 2010-08-16 | accessdate= 2010-08-16 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref> The game was purposely developed to avoid revealing details of its content; the only tagline the company provided was, "Uncertain of his sister's fate, a boy enters Limbo."<ref name="Tagline">{{cite web|title=Limbo entry at Metacritic|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/limbo|work=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=1 December 2010}}</ref> This was chosen so that players could interpret the game's meaning for themselves.<ref name="escapist pax"/>

Jensen drew inspiration from film genres, including works of ''[[film noir]]'', to set the art style of the game; the team's graphic artist, Morten Bramsen, is credited with digitally recreating that art style.<ref name="wsj interview">{{cite web | url = http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/08/04/limbo-a-videogame-that-blends-art-puzzles-and-dreams/ | title = Limbo: A Videogame that Blends Art, Puzzles, and Dreams | work = [[Wall Street Journal]] | date =2010-08-04 | accessdate = 2010-08-04 | first = Jamin | last = Brophy-Warren }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url =  http://www.theage.com.au/digital-life/games/blogs/screenplay/split-screen-looking-good/20100730-10yc8.html | title= Split screen: Looking good  | first = James | last= Dominguez | work = [[The Age]] | date = 2010-07-30 | accessdate = 2010-08-04 }}</ref> Much of the game's flow was storyboarded very early in development, such as the boy's encounters with spiders and mind-controlling worms, as well as the overall transition from a forest to a city, then to an abstract environment.<ref name="ign jensen"/> As development progressed, some of the original ideas became too difficult for the small team to complete; originally, the spider sequences were to be present near the end of the game, but were later moved to the first part.<ref name="ign jensen"/><!--this seems to just be a move, not a scaling down...how does this represent difficulty to create?--> In retrospect, Jensen was aware that the first half of the game contained more scripted events and encounters, while the second half of the game was lonelier and puzzle-heavy; Jensen attributed this to his lack of oversight during the latter stages of development.<ref name="ign jensen"/> 

The game's audio was created by Martin Stig Andersen, a graduate with specialization in [[acousmatic music]] from the [[Royal Academy of Music in Aarhus]].<ref name="ign jensen"/> Andersen sought to create non-traditional acousmatic music exclusively incorporating the sound effects of the game's environments; one example he pointed to was the use of electricity noises while in the presence of a ruined neon "HOTEL" sign.<ref name="ign jensen"/> Many reviews for the game stated that there was no music in ''Limbo'', but Andersen countered that his sound arrangements helped to evoke emotions; the acousmatic music was intended to leave room for interpretation by the player in the same manner as the game's art and story.<ref name="ign jensen"/>

===Gameplay direction===
[[File:Jeppe_Carlsen_-_Game_Developers_Conference_2011_-_Day_3.jpg|thumb|right|Jeppe Carlsen, the lead designer for ''Limbo''{{'}}s puzzles, speaking at the 2011 Game Developers Conference]]
''Limbo'' was designed to avoid the pitfalls of major titles, where the same gameplay mechanic is used repeatedly.<ref name="ign jensen"/> Carlsen, initially brought aboard as a programmer for the custom [[game engine]], became the lead designer after Playdead found him to be capable at creating puzzles.<ref name="ign jensen"/> Carlsen stated that the puzzles within ''Limbo'' were designed to "[keep] you guessing all the way through".<ref name="rps interview"/> Jensen also wanted to make the puzzles feel like a natural part of the environment, and to avoid the feeling that the player was simply moving from puzzle to puzzle through the course of the game.<ref name="ign jensen"/> Carlsen identified examples of puzzles from other games that he wanted to avoid. He wanted to avoid simple puzzles that gave the player little satisfaction in its solution, such as a puzzle in ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]'' that involved simply moving a sun-lit mirror to specific points in a room. In contrast, Carlsen wanted to avoid making the puzzle so complex with many separate parts that the player would resort to trial-and-error and eventually come out with the solution without thinking about why the solution worked; Carlsen used an example of a puzzle from the 2008 ''[[Prince of Persia (2008 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'' game that had seven different mechanics that he never bothered to figure out himself.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://gdc.gamespot.com/story/6301771/playdead-on-limbos-puzzles | title = Playdead on Limbo's puzzles | first = Guy | last = Cocker | date = 2011-03-03 | accessdate = 2011-03-03 | publisher = [[Gamespot]] }}</ref><ref name="escapist jensen gdc2011">{{Cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/conferences/gdc_2011/8685-Limbos-Puzzle-Creator-Is-Your-Enemy | title = Limbo's Puzzle Creator Is Your Enemy | first = Susan | last = Arendt | date = 2011-03-03 | accessdate = 2011-03-03 | work = [[Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]] }}</ref> Carlsen designed ''Limbo''{{'}}s puzzles to fall between these limits, demonstrating one puzzle that only has three elements: a switch panel, an electrified floor, and a chain; the goal&mdash;to use the chain to cross the electrified floor&mdash;is immediately obvious to the player, and then tasks the player to determine the right combination of moves and timing to complete it safely.<ref name="escapist jensen gdc2011"/> The decision to provide little information to the player was an initial challenge in creating the game. Early playtesters would have no idea of how to solve certain puzzles. To improve this, they created scenarios before troublesome spots that highlighted the appropriate actions; for example, when they found players did not think about pulling a boat onto shore to use as a platform to reach a higher ledge, they presented the player with a box-pulling puzzle earlier to demonstrate the pulling mechanics.<ref name="gamasutra gdc"/> 

The team developed the game's puzzles by first assuming the player was their "worst enemy", and made puzzles as devious as possible, but then scaled back their difficulty or added visual and audible aids as if the player was a friend.<ref name="gamasutra gdc"/> One example given by Carlsen is a puzzle involving a spider early in the game; the solution requires pushing a bear trap to snare the spider's legs in it. Early designs of this puzzle had the bear trap on the same screen as the spider, and Playdead found playtesters focused too much on the trap. The developers altered the puzzle to put the trap in a tree in an earlier off-screen section when facing the spider; the spider's actions would eventually cause this trap to drop to the ground and become a weapon against the spider. Carlsen stated that this arrangement created a situation where the player felt helpless when initially presented with the deadly spider, but then assisted the player through an audible cue when the trap had dropped, enabling the player to discover the solution.<ref name="gamasutra gdc"/> 

Playdead included gruesome death sequences to highlight incorrect solutions and discourage players from repeating their mistakes.<ref name="gamasutra gdc"/> While they expected players to run the boy into numerous deaths while trying solutions, Carlsen stated that their goal was to ensure death wasn't a penalty in the game, and made the death animations entertaining to keep the player interested.<ref name="gamasutra gdc"/> Carlsen noted several early puzzles were too complex for the game, but they would end up using a portion of these larger puzzles in the final release.<ref name="gamasutra gdc"/>

''Limbo'' was generally praised for its puzzle design and the simplicity of its controls.  Jake Gaskill of [[G4 TV]] was impressed by the complexity of the puzzles based on the two simple actions of jumping and grabbing onto objects, similar to ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'', with a variety of elements to assure "you<U+2019>re always facing something new and challenging" during the game.<ref name="g4tv review">{{cite web | url= http://g4tv.com/games/xbox-360/63971/limbo/articles/71439/Limbo/ | title = Limbo | first = Jake | last = Gaskill | date = 2010-07-19 | accessdate = 2010-07-24 | publisher = [[G4 TV]] }}</ref>  ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Matt Miller commented that part of the success of ''Limbo'' is that "every one of these [puzzles] stands alone"; the game accomplishes this in Miller's opinion by varying the elements throughout the game, and preventing the player from getting too accustomed to similar solutions since "everything changes".<ref name="gi review">{{cite news | work = [[Game Informer]] | date = August 2010 | first = Matt | last= Miller | pages = 110 | title = Limbo  }}</ref> [[Gamespy]]'s Ryan Scott believed that the game empowered the player to work through solutions themselves, and its puzzle design, "with its elegant simplicity, offers up what feels like a world of meaningful possibilities".<ref name="gamespy review"/>  The frequency of death was not considered a distraction from the game; not only were the deaths seen as necessary as part of learning and overcoming each obstacle,<ref name="torontosun review">{{cite web | url = http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/videogames/2010/07/23/14805026.html | title = <U+2018>Limbo<U+2019> simply beautiful | work = [[Toronto Sun]] | date = 2010-07-24 | accessdate = 2010-07-25 }}</ref><ref name="msnbc review">{{cite web | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38450368/ns/technology_and_science-games/ | title = 'Limbo' is heaven to play | first = Winda | last = Benedetti  | work = [[MSNBC]] | date = 2010-07-28 | accessdate = 2010-07-28 }}</ref> but reviewers found the checkpoints where the player would restart to be plentiful throughout the game.<ref name="eurog review"/> Will Freeman of ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised the game but noted that beyond the "smoke and mirrors" of ''Limbo''{{'}}s artwork, the game is "undermined by the title's lack of innovative gameplay", which he says has been seen in earlier platform games.<ref name="guardian review"/>

===Presentation===
''Limbo''{{'}}s graphical and audio presentation were considered by reviewers as exceptional and powerful elements of the game. The monochrome approach, coupled with [[film grain]] filter, focusing techniques and lighting, were compared to both ''[[film noir]]'' and dreamlike tableaus of [[silent film]]s, allowing the visual elements of the game to carry much of the story's weight.<ref name="ign review"/><ref name="cnet review">{{cite web | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20010961-1.html | title = Happily getting stuck in Limbo | publisher = [[CNet]] | first = Jeff | last = Bakalar | coauthors = Stein, Scott; Ackerman, Dan | date = 2010-07-19 | accessdate= 2010-07-22 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/games/game-guy/article_48b9456c-9413-11df-b203-00127992bc8b.html | title = 'Limbo' is dark, disturbing joyride | first= David | last = Sheets | date = 2010-07-20 | accessdate = 2010-09-07 | work = [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] }}</ref> Cian Hassett of [[PALGN]] likened the effect to watching the game through an old-fashioned film projector that creates "one of the most unsettling and eerily beautiful environments" in video gaming.<ref name="palgn review">{{cite web | url = http://palgn.com.au/xbox-360/16942/limbo-review/ | title = Limbo Review | first = Cian | last = Hassett | date = 2010-07-22 | accessdate=  2010-07-22 | publisher = [[PALGN]] }}</ref> Garrett Martin of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' compared the art style and game design decisions to [[German Expressionism]] with "dreamlike levels that twist and spin in unexpected angles".<ref name="bostonherald"/>  The art style itself was praised as minimalistic, and considered reminiscent of the art of [[Lotte Reiniger]], [[Edward Gorey]], [[Fritz Lang]], and [[Tim Burton]].<ref name="wsj interview"/><ref name="cnet review"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cnet.de/digital-lifestyle/spiele/41535566/limbo.htm |title = Limbo | publisher = [[CNet]] Germany | date = 2010-07-30 | accessdate = 2010-08-25 | language = German | quote = ''Fast scheint es so, als h<U+00E4>tte jemand ein Werk der Silhouetten-Animationsfilmerin Lotte Reiniger in die digitale Gegenwart katapultiert.''

Reviewers found the sound effects within the game critical to the game's impact.

The absence of direct narrative, such as through cutscenes or in-game text, was a mixed point for reviewers. John Teti of [[Eurogamer]] considered the game's base story to be metaphorical for a "story of a search for companionship", and that the few encounters with human characters served as "emotional touchstones" that drove the story forward; ultimately, Teti stated that these elements make ''Limbo'' "a game that has very few humans, but a surplus of humanity".<ref name="eurog review"/> Hatfield praised the simplicity of the game's story, commenting that, "with no text, no dialogue, and no explanation, it manages to communicate circumstance and causality to the player more simply than most games".<ref name="ign review"/> Both Teti and Hatfield noted that some of the story elements were weaker in the second half of the game, when there are almost no human characters with whom the player comes into contact, but that the game ends with an unexpected revelation.<ref name="eurog review"/><ref name="ign review"/> [[GameSpot]]'s Tom McShea found no issues with the game posing questions on "death versus life and reality versus dream", but purposely providing no answers for them, allowing the player to contemplate these on their own.<ref name="gamespot review">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/puzzle/limbo/review.html | title = Limbo Review | first = Tom | last = McShae | date = 2010-07-21 | accessdate = 2010-07-21 | publisher = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref> McShae also considered that the brief but gruesome death scenes for the boy helped to create an "emotional immediacy that is difficult to forget".<ref name="gamespot review"/> The ''[[New York Daily News]]''{{'}} Stu Horvath noted that ''Limbo'' "turns its lack of obvious narrative into one of the most compelling riddles in videogames".<ref name="nydailynews review">{{cite web | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/2010/07/26/2010-07-26_limbo_is_heaven_for_gamers__and_impressive_debut_for_playdead_studios.html | title = Limbo | first = Stu | last= Hogvath | work = [[New York Daily News]] | date = 2010-07-26 | accessdate =2010-07-27 }}</ref>

Other reviews disliked the lack of story or its presentation within ''Limbo''. Justin Haywald of [[1UP.com]] was critical of the lacking narrative, feeling that the game failed to explain the purpose of the constructed traps or rationale for how the game's world worked, and that the final act left him "more confused than when [he] began". Haywald had contrasted ''Limbo'' to ''Braid'', a similar platform game with minimalistic elements which communicates its metaphorical story to the player through in-game text.<ref name="1UP.com">{{Cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3180445 | title = Limbo (Xbox 360) | first = Justin | last = Haywald | date = 2010-07-19 | accessdate = 2010-07-21 | publisher = [[1UP.com]] }}</ref> Roger Hargreaves of ''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]'' stated that the game has "very little evidence that [Playdead] really knew where they were going with the game", citing the second half, when the player is traveling through a factory-type setting and where he felt the game became more like a typical two-dimensional platform game, and led to an anticlimactic ending; Hargreaves contrasted this to more gruesome elements of the first half, such as encountering corpses of children and having to use those as part of the puzzle solving aspects.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/835735-games-review-limbo-brings-arthouse-gaming-to-xbox-live-arcade | title = Games review: Limbo brings arthouse gaming to Xbox Live Arcade | work = [[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] | date=  2010-07-21 | accessdate = 2010-07-22 | first = Roger | last = Hargreaves }}</ref>

Langley, who had expected ''Limbo''{{'}}s sales to fall "due to the lack of repeatable content and being a strictly single player experience", considered that these figures had "beaten everyone<U+2019>s expectations".<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamerbytes.com/2010/09/indepth_xbox_live_arcade_sales_14.php | title = XBLA: In-Depth: Xbox Live Arcade Sales Analysis, August 2010 | date = 2010-09-07 | accessdate = 2010-09-07 | publisher = [[Gamerbytes]] | first = Ryan | last = Langley }}</ref> Phil Spencer, the Vice-President of Microsoft Game Studios, stated in September 2010 that ''Limbo'' was "our number one Summer of Arcade game by a long stretch", and further posed that ''Limbo'' represents a shift in the type of game that gamers want out of online on-demand game services; "it's becoming less about iconic [intellectual property] that people know and it's becoming more diverse".<ref>{{cite web | url =  http://www.1up.com/news/limbo-best-selling-summer-arcade-title | title = Limbo was the Best-Selling Summer of Arcade Title "by a Long Stretch" | first = Kris | last= Pigna | publisher = [[1UP.com]] | date = 2010-09-18 | accessdate = 2010-09-18 }}</ref> ''Limbo'' was the third-highest selling Xbox Live Arcade title in 2010, selling 527,000 and generating about $7.5 million in revenue.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.computerandvideogames.com/285755/news/record-xbox-live-arcade-revenues-in-2010/ | title = Record Xbox Live Arcade revenues in 2010 | work = [[Computer and Video Games]] | date = 2011-01-27 | accessdate= 2011-01-27 | first = Tom | last = Ivan }}</ref> In March 2011, Microsoft listed ''Limbo'' as the 11th highest selling game to date on Xbox Live.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/115/1158568p1.html | title = The All-time Best-selling XBLA Games | first = Daemon | last = Hatfield | date = 2011-03-30 | accessdate = 2011-03-30 | publisher = [[IGN]] }}</ref> Applications for grants from the Nordic Game Program, which had funded ''Limbo''{{'}}s initial development, increased 50% in the second half of 2010, believed to be tied to the game's success.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2010-10-19-record-number-of-entrants-for-nordic-game-funding | title = Record number of entrants for Nordic Game funding | publisher = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] | first =  Dave | last = Pearson | date = 2010-10-19 | accessdate = 2010-11-11 }}</ref>
