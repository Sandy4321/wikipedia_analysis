{{Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway}}
The '''Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway''' was an extension of the [[Caledonian Railway]] in [[Scotland]] that provided services between [[Ardrossan]] and [[Glasgow]], with branches to [[Irvine]] and [[Kilbirnie]]. The northern section of the line is still open as part of the [[Cathcart Circle Lines]].

==History==
===1883-1897: Early days===
The Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway began life as the '''Barrmill and Kilwinning Railway''', which was to be a 6.5 mile line running from [[Barrmill railway station|Barrmill station]] on the [[Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway]] to a junction just north of [[Kilwinning railway station|Kilwinning station]] on the former [[Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway]].<ref name="audry60">Awdry, page 60</ref> To this effect, the 'Barrmill and Kilwinning Railway Act' received [[Royal Assent]] on [[20 August]] [[1883]].<ref name="audry60"/> However a year later a heavily modified act was submitted to Parliament, including extensions to Ardrossan, Irvine, Ardeer Ironworks, Eglinton Ironworks and Kilbirnie. A change of name for the company was also approved, and so the 'Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway Act' received Royal Assent on [[28 August]] [[1884]].<ref name="audry85">Audry, page 85</ref>

The opening ceremony for the railway took place on [[3 September]] [[1888]] at the [[Ardrossan North railway station|Ardrossan station]], with a special train service running to Glasgow that day. Full passenger services began on [[4 September]] [[1888]].<ref>Thomas, page 92</ref> The branch to Kilbirnie was opened on [[1 November]] [[1889]] for goods traffic and opened to passengers on [[2 December]] [[1889]],<ref name="thomas93">Thomas, page 93</ref> and the branch to [[Irvine (Bank Street) railway station|Irvine]] was opened the following year on [[2 June]] [[1890]]. [[Ardrossan Montgomerie Pier railway station|Ardrossan Montgomerie Pier station]] opened on [[30 May]] [[1890]].<ref name="thomas93"/>

===1898-1923: Further extensions===
Fierce rivalry with the Glasgow and South Western Railway meant that in 1898 construction began on a further extension of the line from [[Giffen railway station|Giffen]] to [[Newton (South Lanarkshire) railway station|Newton]]. This meant that the Caledonian Railway would be able to avoid use of the [[Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway|Glasgow and Kilmarnock Joint Railway]], and therefore avoid sharing revenue with the G&SWR.<ref name="thomas94">Thomas, page 94</ref> After five years of construction the new branch opened on [[1 May]] [[1903]] with several new stations along the route, many of which were duplicates of stations on the joint line.<ref name="thomas94"/>

===1923-present: A premature end===
The duplication of lines and stations would soon become worthless when both the Caledonian and Glasgow and South Western Railways were merged as part of the larger [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] group in 1923. Many stations had to be renamed so as not to become confused with their former G&SW counterparts. With too many lines serving the one area and no competition, the first closures on the line occurred in the summer of 1930 when the Irvine branch was closed to passenger services,<ref>Stansfield, page 27</ref> with the Kilbirnie branch closing to all traffic later that same year (although freight services to [[Glengarnock High railway station|Glengarnock]] continued until 1945).<ref>Stansfield, page 28</ref> On [[4 July]] [[1932]] all stations from Ardrossan North to Uplawmoor were closed to passenger services.<ref name="stansfield31">Stansfield, page 31</ref> Passenger and freight services to Montgomerie Pier continued for many years, and with the closure of the Stevenston to Kilwinning East section in June 1947 a link was created between the remaining line to Montgomerie Pier and the former G&SWR Glasgow line just to the west of the branch to [[Ardeer Platform railway station|Ardeer station]].<ref name="stansfield31"/> This link was eventually closed to all traffic in 1968, and was completely lifted in 1970.  A section of track from the site of Ardrossan North station remained joined to the former Ardrossan Railway.  This section of track was used by the Shell Bitumen plant at Ardrossan Harbour.

Today the only operational section of the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway is the line between Newton and Neilston, which was electrified in the early 1960s, and sees regular passenger services as part of the [[Cathcart Circle Lines]]. Various landmarks of the railway still exist throughout the former route: the eleven arch span Gree Viaduct (pictured) still exists between the former Lugton and Giffen stations, despite permission for its demolition being granted on [[24 December]] [[2002]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.north-ayrshire.gov.uk/ChiefExec/comRA.nsf/e9ee67f48fbb9003802569d700533758/7b42ed43b609f0e180256e600057c35c?OpenDocument|title=North Ayrshire Council - Planning Committee Report|date=2004-04-05|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref> The nearby Giffenmill Viaduct in Barrmill remained intact until its demolition in 2006.<ref name="viaduct">[http://www.beith.org/modules/news/article.php?storyid=1293 Beith Online - Giffen Viaduct]</ref> Also in the area is a single track running from [[Lugton]] which follows the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway line to Beith until it reaches Barrmill, where it then heads south through [[Giffen railway station|Giffen]] to [[DMC Beith]] along the original route of the L&AR before the 1905 extension was built. This track, mostly relaid in the 1950s, was used for freight by DMC Beith, however it fell into disuse in 1996.<ref name="viaduct"/>
