The '''Fifteenth Amendment''' ('''Amendment XV''') to the [[United States Constitution]] prohibits each government in the United States from denying a citizen the [[suffrage|right to vote]] based on that citizen's "[[Race (classification of humans)|race]], [[colored|color]], or previous condition of servitude" (i.e., slavery). It was ratified on February 3, 1870.

The Fifteenth Amendment is one of the [[Reconstruction Amendments]].

==History==
{{Ref improve section|date=January 2009}}
The Fifteenth Amendment is the third of the [[Reconstruction Amendments]]. This amendment prohibits the states and the federal government from using a citizen's race (this applies to all races),<ref>''[[Rice v. Cayetano]]'', {{ussc|528|495|2000}}</ref> color or previous status as a slave as a voting qualification. The [[North Carolina Supreme Court]] upheld this right of free men of color to vote; in response, amendments to the [[North Carolina Constitution]] removed the right in 1835.<ref>{{Cite document|url=http://statelibrary.dcr.state.nc.us/nc/stgovt/preconst.htm#1835|title=The Constitution of North Carolina|accessdate=2008-04-16|publisher=State Library of North Carolina}}</ref> Granting free men of color the right to vote could be seen as giving them the rights of citizens, an argument explicitly made by [[Benjamin Robbins Curtis|Justice Curtis's]] dissent in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'':<ref>{{cite document|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0060_0393_ZD1.html|title=Dred Scott v. Sandford, Curtis dissent|accessdate=2008-04-16|publisher=Legal Information Institute at [[Cornell Law School]]}}</ref>{{quote|Of this there can be no doubt. At the time of the ratification of the [[Articles of Confederation]], all free native-born inhabitants of the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and North Carolina, though descended from African slaves, were not only citizens of those States, but such of them as had the other necessary qualifications possessed the franchise of electors, on equal terms with other citizens.}}

Both the final House and Senate versions of the amendment broadly protected the right of citizens to vote and to hold office.<ref>[http://islandia.law.yale.edu/amar/lawreview/1996Fifteenth.pdf The Fifteenth Amendment And "Political Rights"]</ref> The final House version read, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote and hold office shall not be denied or abridged by any State on the account of race, color, nativity, property, creed or previous condition of servitude".<ref>Congressional Globe, 40th Cong., 3d Sess (1869) pg. 1318</ref> Likewise, the final Senate version read, "No discrimination in the exercise by any citizen of the United States of the elective franchise, or in the privilege of holding office, shall in any State by based upon race, color or previous condition of said citizen or his ancestors."<ref>Congressional Globe, 40th Cong., 3d Sess (1869) pg. 1318</ref>

However, both versions of the amendment posed serious challenges in being ratified by three-fourths of the states.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gillette|first=W.|title=The Right to Vote|year=1969|pages=71}}</ref> A handful of states still required voters and candidates to be Christian. Southern Republicans were reluctant to undermine loyalty tests, which the Reconstruction state governments used to limit the influence of ex-Confederates, and partly because some Northern and Western politicians wanted to continue disenfranchising non-native Irish and Chinese.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877|pages=448|authorlink=Eric Foner|isbn=978-0060937164|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|date=2002-02-05}}</ref>

To increase chances of ratification, the amendment was revised in a conference committee to remove any reference to holding office and only prohibited discrimination based on race, color or previous condition of servitude. Yet, despite these changes, ratification of the amendment was still in some doubt.

Virginia, Mississippi, Texas and Georgia, were required to ratify the amendment as a precondition for rejoining the Union and having congressional representation. Besides these States, Nevada ratified the Amendment first, but only after reassurances from U.S. Senator William Stewart that the amendment would not preclude prohibiting the Chinese and Irish immigrants from voting.<ref>http://15thamendment.harpweek.com/HubPages/CommentaryPage.asp?Commentary=03Ratification</ref> California and Oregon both opposed the measure out of fear of Chinese immigrants, New York initially ratified the amendment, but legislators later attempted to rescind the ratification, a controversial decision that might have resulted in a court challenge, but for the fact that on March 30, 1870, enough states had ratified the amendment for it to become part of the Constitution.

[[Thomas Mundy Peterson]] was the first [[African American]] to vote after the amendment's adoption. Peterson cast his ballot in a school board election held in [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey]] on March 31, 1870.<ref>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=6935257 More about Thomas Mundy Peterson]</ref> On a ''[[per capita]]'' and absolute basis, more blacks were elected to public office during the period from 1865 to 1880 than at any other time in American history including a number of [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] which were effectively under the control of a strong African American caucus. These legislatures brought in programs that are considered part of government's role now, but at the time were radical, such as universal [[public education]]. They also set all racially biased laws aside, including [[anti-miscegenation laws]] (laws prohibiting [[interracial marriage]]).{{Dubious|date=September 2009}}

Despite the efforts of groups like the [[Ku Klux Klan]] to intimidate black voters and white Republicans, assurance of federal support for democratically elected southern governments meant that most Republican voters could both vote and rule in confidence. For example, an all-white mob in the [[Battle of Liberty Place]] attempted to take over the interracial government of [[New Orleans]]. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] sent in federal troops to restore the elected mayor.

However, in order to appease the [[Southern United States|South]] after his close election, [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] agreed to withdraw federal troops. He also overlooked rampant fraud and electoral violence in the [[Deep South]], despite several attempts by the Republicans to pass laws protecting the rights of black voters and to punish intimidation. Without the restrictions, voting place violence against blacks and Republicans increased, including instances of [[murder]]. Most of this was done without any intervention by law enforcement and often even with their cooperation.

By the 1890s, many Southern states had strict voter eligibility laws, including [[literacy test]]s and [[poll tax]]es. Some states even made it difficult to find a place to register to vote.

==Adoption==
The Congress proposed the Fifteenth Amendment on February 26, 1869.<ref name="Mount 2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/constamrat.html|title=Ratification of Constitutional Amendments|accessdate=February 24, 2007|last=Mount|first=Steve|year=2007|month=January}}</ref> The final vote in the Senate was 39 senators for, 13 against, and 14 absent.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gillette|first=W.|title=The Right to Vote|year=1969|pages=75}}</ref> Several fierce advocates of equal rights, such as Massachusetts Senator [[Charles Sumner]], abstained from voting because the amendment did not prohibit devices which states might use to restrict black suffrage, such as [[literacy tests]] and [[poll taxes]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gillette|first=W.|title=The Right to Vote|year=1969|pages=76}}</ref> The vote in the House was 144 to 44 with 35 members not voting. The House vote was almost entirely along party lines, with no Democrats supporting the bill and only 3 Republicans voting against it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gillette|first=W.|title=The Right to Vote|year=1969|pages=73<U+2013>74}}</ref>
