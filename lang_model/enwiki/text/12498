"'''A Rugrats Chanukah'''", titled onscreen as "'''Chanukah'''" and sometimes called the "'''Rugrats Chanukah Special'''", is a [[television special|special]] episode of [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]'s animated television series ''[[Rugrats]]''. The first episode of the show's fourth season and the sixty-sixth overall, it tells the story of the [[Jewish]] holiday [[Chanukah]] through the eyes of [[List of Rugrats characters#Main babies and kids|the Rugrats]], who imagine themselves as the main characters. Meanwhile, [[List of Rugrats characters#Adults|Grandpa Boris]] and his long-time rival, Schlomo, feud over who will play the lead in the local [[synagogue]]'s Chanukah play.

Raymie Muzquiz directed "A Rugrats Chanukah" from a script by J. David Stem and [[David N. Weiss]]. In 1992, Nickelodeon executives had [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] the idea of a Chanukah special to the production team, but the concept was revised and became the 1995 special, "[[A Rugrats Passover]]". After production of the Passover episode wrapped, the crew returned to the Chanukah idea. Nickelodeon broadcast "A Rugrats Chanukah" on December 4, 1996; the episode received a [[Nielsen Rating]] of 7.9 and positive reviews from television critics. Along with other ''Rugrats'' episodes featuring Boris and his wife, the special attracted controversy when the [[Anti-Defamation League]] compared the character designs to [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] drawings from a 1930s [[Nazism|Nazi]] newspaper.

==Plot==
On Chanukah, [[List of Rugrats characters#Adults|Grandma Minkus]] reads a book about the meaning of the holiday to the babies [[Tommy Pickles|Tommy]], [[Chuckie Finster|Chuckie]], [[Phil and Lil DeVille|Phil, and Lil]]. The babies imagine that they are the story's characters; [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah]] (Tommy) is outraged by [[Antiochus IV|King "Antonica"]] ([[Angelica Pickles|Angelica]]), who has taken over [[Judea|the Jewish kingdom]] and forced [[Greek culture]] on its inhabitants. Judah leads an army of Jewish [[Maccabees]] to war against Antonica's [[Seleucid Empire]], emerging victorious. When the Maccabees rededicate the [[Holy Temple]], they discover there is only enough olive oil to light the Temple's eternal flame for one day; miraculously, it remains lit for eight. 

Meanwhile, Grandpa Boris learns that Schlomo, a rival from his youth in Russia, will be playing the Greek king in the local synagogue's Chanukah play. Boris is furious, having played the part in previous years and now being cast as Judah. The Pickles, a functional, American family, fear that Boris's rivalry with Schlomo will ruin the play. When the babies finish hearing the story, they find out about Schlomo and form the impression that he truly is the Greek king, whom they dub the "Meany of Chanukah". They go onto the stage during the play and light the [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|Menorah]], hoping to defeat the "Meany". The sentiment inadvertently leads Boris and Schlomo to remember the true meaning of Chanukah and reconcile.

==Production==
Nickelodeon executives [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] the idea of making a Chanukah special to the ''[[Rugrats]]'' production team in 1992.

===Anti-Defamation League controversy===
"A Rugrats Chanukah", along with other ''Rugrats'' episodes featuring Boris and his wife, Minka, attracted controversy when the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) charged that the two characters resembled [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] drawings that were featured in a 1930s [[Nazism|Nazi]] newspaper. Nickelodeon's then-president, [[Albie Hecht]] (himself Jewish), professed bewilderment and called the accusation absurd.<ref name="controversy">{{cite book|title=How The Left Lost Teen Spirit|author=Goldberg, Danny|year=2005|publisher=Akashic Books|page=216|isbn=0971920680}}</ref> The controversy resurfaced in 1998 after the ADL made the same claims about Boris' appearance in a ''Rugrats'' comic strip that ran in newspapers during the [[Jewish New Year]]. The organization was also offended by the character's recitation of the [[Mourner's Kaddish]] in the strip. Nickelodeon's new president, [[Herb Scannell]], agreed with the criticism and apologized, promising never to run the character or the strip again.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue3.9/3.9pages/3.9business.html|title=Rugrats Offends Media Watchdogs|work=[[Animation World Magazine]]|author=Jackson, Wendy; Amidi, Amid|date=1998-12|accessdate=2009-12-19}}</ref>
