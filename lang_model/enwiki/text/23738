The '''2004 Emerald Bowl''' was a post-season [[college football]] [[bowl game]] between the [[New Mexico Lobos football|New Mexico Lobos]] and the [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy Midshipmen]] on December 30, 2004 at [[AT&T Park|SBC Park]] in [[San Francisco, California]], United States. The game, which Navy won with a final score of 34<U+2013>19, was highlighted by a 26-play drive from the Midshipmen that took up almost 15 minutes of [[Time_of_possession#T|game time]] and set the record for the longest drive in a [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) college football game. The contest was the third time the [[Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl|Emerald Bowl]] was played and the final game of the [[2004 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2004 NCAA football season]] for both teams.

The [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|conference independent]] Navy Midshipmen, who finished the regular season with a 9<U+2013>2 record, accepted an invitation to play in the game on November 22, 2004. Eight days later, the 7<U+2013>4 New Mexico Lobos agreed to fill the open spot reserved for a [[Mountain West Conference]] team. Leading up to the game, sports writers predicted that a major highlight of the contest would be the [[Rush (gridiron football)|rushing offenses]] of Midshipmen head coach [[Paul Johnson (American football coach)|Paul Johnson]] and Lobos head coach [[Rocky Long]]; both teams ranked in the top rushing offenses in the [[Division_I_(NCAA)#Football_Bowl_Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS). The Lobos also ranked as one of the nation's top rushing defenses.

The game began at 1:35 p.m. [[Pacific Standard Time|PST]] in rainy conditions that had affected the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] for days before the contest. The Lobos scored a [[touchdown]] on the game's first drive to take an early lead, but the Midshipmen scored three touchdowns to bring the score to 21<U+2013>7 early in the second quarter. After the Lobos narrowed that lead to 12 points by the end of the third quarter, the Midshipmen began a long drive which took up much of the fourth quarter. The drive ended with a [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|field goal]], which gave Navy a 15-point lead with a little over two minutes remaining in the game. On the next drive from the Lobos, the Midshipmen forced a [[turnover on downs]] and [[Running out the clock|ran out the clock]] with their last possession to win the game.

Midshipmen players Aaron Polanco and Vaughn Kelley were named the game's offensive and defensive [[Most Valuable Player]]s, respectively. The win caused the Midshipmen to finish the season with a 10<U+2013>2 record, their best record since the [[1905 college football season|1905 season]]. After the game, the [[AP Poll|Associated Press College Poll]] and the [[Coaches' Poll|''USA Today'' Coaches' Poll]] ranked the team as the 24th best in the nation. The loss caused the Lobos' record to fall to 7<U+2013>5.

==Team selection==
First played in 2002 when it was called the [[2002 San Francisco Bowl|Diamond Walnut San Francisco Bowl]], organizers announced a new name in May 2004 for that year's iteration of the annual game for the [[2004<U+2013>05 NCAA football bowl games|2004<U+2013>05 NCAA football bowl season]]. The new title for the game was derived from the Emerald Nuts brand owned by the game's primary sponsor, [[Diamond Foods]]. Originally, the game was to feature the sixth [[bowl eligibility|bowl eligible]] team from the [[Pacific-12 Conference|Pacific-10 Conference]] and the third eligible team from the Mountain West Conference.<ref name="sponsor">{{cite press release |url=http://www.kraftbowl.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/072508aae.html |publisher=[[Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl]] |accessdate=2012-10-14 |date=2004-05-10 |title=Emerald Bowl Announces New Date & Time for '04 Game}}</ref>

Since only two teams from the Pacific-10 Conference had become bowl eligible near the end of the [[2004 NCAA Division I-A football season]], organizers looked to the [[United States Naval Academy]] Midshipmen, who were not a member of any athletic conference, to fill the open spot. The team accepted their invitation to play in the Emerald Bowl on November 22, two days after defeating the [[2004 Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team|Rutgers Scarlet Knights]] with a score of 54<U+2013>21 to earn an 8<U+2013>2 record.<ref name="navy invitation">{{cite press release |publisher=[[Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl]] |date=2004-11-22 |title=Navy Accepts Invitation to the Emerald Bowl |url=http://www.kraftbowl.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/072508aaf.html |accessdate=2012-10-12 }}</ref> The Midshipmen had originally intended to play in the [[2004 Liberty Bowl]], but chose the Emerald Bowl when it looked as though Liberty Bowl organizers were seeking a matchup of more "high-powered offenses".<ref name="Navy set" /> After defeating the [[Army Black Knights football|Army Black Knights]] with a score of 42<U+2013>13 in that year's [[Army<U+2013>Navy Game]], the Midshipmen ended the regular season with a record of 9<U+2013>2, the first time since the [[1963 college football season]] that Navy had won nine or more games in a season.

==Pre-game buildup==
Prior to the game, [[Spread betting|spread bettors]] favored the New Mexico Lobos by a single point.<ref name="odds" /> Given both teams' propensity for running the ball and the rainy weather conditions that had affected the San Francisco area for days prior to the game, analysts expected that it would center around both teams' rushing offenses.<ref name="msnbc" /> ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' sports writer Kent Baker predicted that "the teams' non-reliance on the pass will serve both well. The game should be fairly low scoring and rapidly played, with the Midshipmen eking out a victory."<ref name="preview" />

==Game summary==
The 2004 Emerald Bowl began with a 1:35 p.m. PST [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]] time in [[AT&T Park|SBC Park]]. Because the field had been converted from the [[Baseball field|baseball diamond]] typically used by the [[San Francisco Giants]], both teams shared the same sideline during the game.<ref name="msnbc" /> Rainy conditions caused the field's natural grass surface to became muddier as the game progressed. Although 30,563 tickets were sold, an increase of 19 percent from the [[2003 San Francisco Bowl|2003 game]], official in-stadium attendance was listed at 28,856, an increase of 28 percent over the previous year.<ref name="new network">{{cite press release |date=2005-03-28 |url=http://www.kraftbowl.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/072508aai.html |accessdate=2012-10-19 |title=Emerald Bowl Announces New Date and Network for 2005 Game |location=[[San Francisco, California]]}}</ref> Despite New Mexico's closer proximity to the bowl site, Midshipmen fans comprised a large portion of the crowd; Navy directly sold 18,000 tickets prior to the game and was given credit for 22,000.<ref name="navy launches">{{cite news |title=Navy Launches Bowl Promotion Campaign |url=http://www.capitalgazette.com/sports/navy_sports/navy-launches-bowl-promotion-campaign/article_e408bc59-df9d-5e99-9a62-e2101dae21bb.html |newspaper=[[The Capital|Maryland Gazette]] |publisher=Capital Gazette Communications |date=2012-11-03 |accessdate=2012-11-04 |last=Wagner |first=Bill |quote=Gladchuk said Navy directly sold 18,000 tickets and was given credit for 22,000 that year by Cavalli, who has been executive director throughout the bowl's existence. }}</ref> The game aired live on [[ESPN2]], with [[Eric Collins]] and [[Andre Ware]] serving as announcers.

===First quarter===

The Midshipmen kicked off to the Lobos to begin the game. New Mexico then executed a 66-yard drive that comprised nearly seven minutes of game time, which ended when [[quarterback]] Kole McKamey threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to Logan Hall. Midshipmen quarterback Aaron Polanco responded on the next drive by scoring a 14-yard rushing touchdown, tying the score at 7<U+2013>7. On the following drive from the Lobos, running back DonTrell Moore tore his [[anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL) when Midshipmen [[cornerback]] Vaughn Kelley made a low tackle.<ref name="moore" /> Moore [[fumble]]d the ball as he was tackled, and did not return for the remainder of the game. Midshipmen [[linebacker]] Lane Jackson recovered the fumble. On the Midshipmen's next drive, running back Frank Divis executed a [[Halfback option play|halfback option pass]] [[trick play]] to Polanco for 17 yards, the team's biggest gain of the first quarter. Two plays later, Polanco scored another touchdown on a 1-yard run up the middle, giving Navy a 14<U+2013>7 lead at the end of the first quarter.<ref name="play-by-play" />

===Second quarter===
The Midshipmen began the second quarter with a two-play, 30-second drive that ended with a 61-yard touchdown pass from Polanco to receiver Corey Dryden, increasing the team's lead to 21<U+2013>7. The Lobos responded with a rushing touchdown from running back [[Rodney Ferguson]], but kicker Wes Zunker's [[Conversion (gridiron football)|extra point attempt]] was no good, making the score 21<U+2013>13. Midshipmen kicker Geoff Blumenfeld added a 27-yard field goal to bring the score to 24<U+2013>13. McKamey scored another rushing touchdown to cap off another long drive, this time taking up over five minutes of game time, but the team's [[two-point conversion]] attempt failed. Lane Jackson intercepted McKamey's pass on the Lobos final drive before [[half-time]], ending the first half of the game with a score of 24<U+2013>19 in favor of the Midshipmen.<ref name="play-by-play" />

===Third quarter===
The Lobos began the second half of the game with a kickoff to Navy, and after an unsuccessful drive from each team, the Midshipmen began a drive on their own 25-yard line with 11:30 left in the quarter. With 7:01 left, Polanco scored another rushing touchdown for the Midshipmen, this time for 28 yards. The next Lobos drive began with two [[Penalty (gridiron football)|penalties]] from the Midshipmen, moving New Mexico from its own 31-yard line to Navy's 49 before their first [[Snap (gridiron football)|snap]]. The Lobos moved 48 yards over the course of eight plays and almost five minutes of game time, but the team committed a [[turnover on downs]] inches away from the [[Goal line (American football)|goal line]] when running back D.D. Cox was forced out of bounds on fourth down, preventing the team from scoring any points. Getting the ball back with a 31<U+2013>19 lead, Navy began their next drive on their own 1-yard line with 1:41 remaining in the third quarter. Polanco rushed for three more plays before the end of the quarter.<ref name="play-by-play">{{cite web |publisher=ESPN.com |date=2004-12-30 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=243652426&period=0 |title=New Mexico Lobos vs. Navy Midshipmen <U+2013> Play-by-play}}</ref>

Continuing Navy's drive from the previous quarter, Polanco and Eckel continued to run up the middle and the right side of New Mexico's defense for small gains. Polanco attempted two passes, the first of which was incomplete and the second to [[slotback]] Marco Nelson for a first down at the Midshipmen 44-yard line. After 12 plays and over six minutes of game time, the drive reached [[midfield]]. After six more rushing plays from Polanco, Eckel, and slotback Eric Roberts, the team reached the Lobos' 28-yard line. Needing three yards to achieve a [[fourth down conversion]], Navy coach Paul Johnson called a [[Time-out_(sport)#Gridiron_football|time-out]]. On the next play, Frank Divis threw his second halfback option pass of the day to Polanco, gaining six yards to keep the drive alive. Eckel, Divis, and Roberts rushed for six more plays before the drive came to a halt at the Lobos' 5-yard line. On the final play of the drive, Midshipman kicker Geoff Blumenfeld kicked a 22-yard field goal to make the score 34<U+2013>19 with 2:07 left in the game.

The Lobos gained three more first downs on their final drive, but were unable to score again before turning the ball over on downs. The Midshipmen ran one more [[quarterback kneel]] play to [[Running out the clock|run out the clock]], winning the game with a final score of 34<U+2013>19.<ref name="play-by-play" /><ref name="revisiting" />

Though the Lobos gained more first downs and yards on offense than the Midshipmen, their three turnovers and Navy's extended drive in the third and fourth quarters led to the lopsided final score. The 14-minute, 26-second final drive from the Midshipmen, measured by its 26 total plays, set a record for the longest drive in a game.<ref name="2012 record book">{{cite book |title=NCAA Football Records |chapter=FBS Individual Records |year=2012 |url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/2012/fbs.pdf |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |accessdate=2012-10-12 |page=14}}</ref> Prior to the contest, the NCAA had not kept a record for longest drive, but began keeping track for the 2005 edition of the record book. No drive in either college football or in the NFL has exceeded the record in terms of total plays or in time of possession since the game was played.<ref name="revisiting" /> At post-game [[press conference]]s, both coaches discussed the characteristics of the drive:
{{Bquote| I think that you have to give the defense on the other side some credit because they kept us out of the end zone and we had 26 plays. I wasn't a lot of big plays, it was four yards, five yards.
