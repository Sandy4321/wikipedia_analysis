== Origin of the name==
The present city name, meaning "Iron City", was first recorded in 1118 as "castrum ferrum" and refers to the history of iron mining and iron trade in the area. The first written mention of the town took place in 1264 as "minor Mortin", matching the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] name, Kismarton, which is recalling [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]], the patron saint of the main church.

== History ==
Archeological finds prove that the Eisenstadt area was already settled in the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] period. [[Celts]] and [[Roman Empire|Romans]] settled somewhat later. During the [[Migration Period]], the area was settled by different [[Germanic tribes]] and the [[Huns]]. Around 800, during the reign of [[Charlemagne]], settlement by the [[Bavarii]] began.

The fortress built on the original earth works was destroyed by the troops of [[Leopold III, Margrave of Austria]]. In 1241, it was destroyed by the [[Mongol]] invaders. In 1373, the town came into the possession of the [[Kanizsai]] family, who rebuilt the walls surrounding the town and built a fortress at the site of the present day castle between 1388 and 1392. In 1388, Eisenstadt was given the right to hold markets by [[Emperor Sigismund]].

In 1445 Archduke [[Albert VI of Austria]] acquired the town. In 1451 it was ceded to [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]] by [[Matthias Corvinus]] in return for the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]]. Matthias Corvinus reconquered it by force in 1482, but [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] acquired it again in 1490. It remained under [[Habsburg]] rule until 1622. In 1529 and 1532 the [[Ottoman Empire]] conquered Eisenstadt with their advance on the city of [[Vienna]] (see [[Ottoman wars in Europe]]). It was captured by the army of [[Imre Th<U+00F6>k<U+00F6>ly]] in 1683, and it saw the defeat of the [[kuruc]] army of [[S<U+00E1>ndor K<U+00E1>rolyi]] by the [[Habsburgs]] in 1704. A royal town since 1648, it was destroyed by fire in 1589 and 1776.

In 1648, it passed under the rule of the [[House of Esterh<U+00E1>zy|Esterh<U+00E1>zy family]]. These [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] princes permanently changed the face of the city due to their extensive construction especially on their castle, [[Schloss Esterh<U+00E1>zy]]. The appointment of [[Joseph Haydn]] as the prince's ''Hofkapellmeister'' (court orchestra director, composing and performing music) began the great artistic period in the city's history. In 1809, Eisenstadt was occupied by [[France|French]] troops during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; in 1897, it was joined to the railway network.

Until the end of [[World War I]], it was the seat of Kismarton district in Sopron county in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Without plebiscite, the city and the entire Hungarian territory of Burgenland (with the exception of the city of [[Sopron]] where the only plebiscite was held) was transferred to Austria by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain|Saint-Germain]] and [[Treaty of Trianon|Treaties of Trianon]] in 1921. Since 30 April 1925, Eisenstadt is seat of the Burgenland state government and thus the state capital. During [[World War II]], Eisenstadt was heavily bombarded. In 1945, it was occupied by the [[Red Army]], and the city remained until 1955 under Soviet occupation. In 1960, Eisenstadt became the see of its own [[Roman Catholic]] [[diocese]].

== Politics ==
The current [[mayor]] of Eisenstadt is [[Mag. Thomas Steiner]] [[Austrian People's Party|<U+00D6>VP]].

The district council is composed as follows (as of 2007):
* [[Austrian People's Party]] (<U+00D6>VP): 17 seats
