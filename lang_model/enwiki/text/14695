'''George Cedric Wright''' (April 13, 1889{{spaced ndash}}1959) was an American [[violin]]ist and [[wilderness]] [[photographer]] of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|High Sierra]]. He was [[Ansel Adams|Ansel Adams']]s mentor and best friend for decades, and accompanied Adams when three of his most famous photographs were taken. He was a long -time participant in the annual wilderness [[High Trips]] sponsored by the [[Sierra Club]].

==Family==

Cedric Wright was born and raised in [[Alameda, California]]. His father was a successful attorney, and one of his clients was astronomer [[Charles Hitchcock Adams]], Ansel Adams's father. Cedric's uncle, [[William Hammond Wright]], was an astronomer who became head of [[Lick Observatory]].<ref name=Hammond>{{Cite book

==Violinist==

Wright was motivated to become a violinist when he heard a performance by [[Fritz Kreisler]]. After study in the United States, he spent seven years studying with [[Otakar <U+0160>ev<U+010D><U+00ED>k]] in [[Prague]] and [[Vienna]].

Wright was known as a "distinguished violinist", and was a violin teacher at the [[University of California#UC Extension|University of California Extension]] and [[Mills College]] for many years. Renowned violin teacher and conductor [[Louis Persinger]] called him "one of the foremost performers and instructors in the West".<ref>{{Cite journal

==Friendship and collaboration with Ansel Adams==

Wright first met Ansel Adams at a family gathering at the Wright family vacation home in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] when Cedric was about 21 and Ansel was about 8 years old.<ref name=Adams/>  They encountered each other again on a four-week wilderness [[High Trips|High Trip]] in [[Yosemite National Park]], organized by the [[Sierra Club]] in 1923. [[Nancy Newhall]] wrote, "On that first High Trip, Ansel found himself drawn to one Cedric Wright, a violinist, who could fiddle by the fire deep into the night and still be among the first up, making a little fire of twigs . . ."<ref name=Newhall>{{Cite book

Wright introduced Adams to the writings of the British philosopher [[Edward Carpenter]], whose thoughts helped shape both men's world views. Together, they discussed other writers, including [[Elbert Hubbard]] and [[Walt Whitman]].

Back in the Bay Area after their initial 1923 wilderness journey together had ended, Adams became a part of Wright's social circle of musicians and Sierra Club activists who gathered at his [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] home. Adams "idolized" Wright, and he followed in Wright's footsteps by taking long trips into the wilderness of the Sierra Nevada each summer, photographing the remote mountain peaks.<ref name=Alinder/>
  
In his autobiography, Ansel Adams called Cedric Wright "my best friend for many years". He described Wright as "almost an occupant of another world and a creator and messenger of beauty and mysteries. Perhaps his greatest gift was that of imparting confidence to those who were wavering on the edge of fear and indecision; often it was me."<ref name=Adams>{{Cite book

In 1926, Wright introduced Adams to [[Albert Bender]], a patron of the arts who was to play an instrumental role in Adams's enormous success as a photographer.<ref name=Alinder/> Wright was also a close friend of Virginia Best, who was Adams' girlfriend for years. Wright visited with her when Adams was away on photography trips, and she confided in him about the problems in her relationship with Adams. Wright was their [[Groomsman#Best man|best man]] when they were married on January 2, 1928.<ref name=Alinder/>

Wright accompanied Adams when he took three of the most famous photographs of his career: On April 10, 1927, Wright hiked with Adams, Virginia Best, Charles Michael and another photographer, Arnold Williams, to a rocky perch high above Yosemite Valley called the "Diving Board". There, Adams took ''Monolith, the Face of Half Dome'', which Mary Street Alinder called Adams's "most significant photograph" because it was a triumph of visualization showing "extreme manipulation of tonal values". This photo set Adams on the path of becoming America's most well-known photographer.<ref name=Alinder/>  Adams called the excursion a "personally historic moment in my photographic career."<ref name=Adams/>

During the 1932 Sierra Club High Trip to [[Sequoia National Park]], Wright and Adams both photographed Precipice Lake near Eagle Scout Peak, while Virginia swam in the lake, still arrayed with icy patches. Wright was shocked when he saw Adams's ''Frozen Lake and Cliffs, The Sierra Nevada, Sequoia National Park'', so much more beautiful than the photos Wright himself had produced. Mary Street Alinder described the image: "Mirrored ghostly upon the inky waters, a shattered black cliff descends into a partially frozen lake."<ref name=Alinder/>

In 1941, [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Harold L. Ickes|Harold Ickes]] hired Adams for six months to create photographs of lands under the jurisdiction of the [[Department of the Interior]]. Wright accompanied Adams and his young son Michael Adams on a long road trip around the west. While traveling through the [[Rio Chama (Rio Grande)|Chama River]] valley near nightfall on November 1, 1941, they encountered a "fantastic scene", a church and cemetery near [[Hernandez, New Mexico]], and pulled to the side of the road. Adams recalled that he yelled at his son Michael and at Wright to "Get this! Get that, for God's sake! We don't have much time!"<ref name=Adams/>  Desperate to capture the image in the fading light, they scrambled to set up the tripod and camera, knowing that only moments remained before the light was gone. The result was ''[[Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico]]'', a photograph that became so popular and collectible that Adams personally made over 1,300 photographic prints of it during his long career.<ref name=Alinder/>  On October 17, 2006, [[Sotheby's]] auctioned a print of this photograph for $609,600.<ref>{{cite web

The home was known as "party central" among Sierra Club members of the era. Among that social circle were [[Richard M. Leonard]] and his wife Doris, [[Francis P. Farquhar]] and his wife Marjorie, [[David Brower]] and his wife Anne, [[Edgar Wayburn]] and his wife Peggy, and Wright's best friends, Ansel Adams and his wife Virginia.<ref name=Alinder/> Nancy Newhall described the atmosphere: "Meanwhile in Cedric Wright's house among the redwoods in Berkeley, Ansel was finding a warm welcome ... In his house there was music for violin and piano; there was poetry, especially Whitman."<ref name=Newhall/>

==Sierra Club High Trips==

The [[High Trips]] were large wilderness excursions organized and led by the [[Sierra Club]], beginning in 1901. While most of these excursions were to the High Sierra, some were to other destinations, such as the [[Canadian Rockies]] in 1928. Wright's photos of that trip, along with those of Adams and other photographers, were included in a portfolio produced to commemorate it. No other member participated in as many High Trips as Wright, and [[David Brower]] recounted that Wright told him in 1953 that he had participated in 33 High Trips.<ref>{{Cite book

In an article published in 1957, which included eight full-page photographs, Wright described his thoughts about how high mountain beauty resembles great music: "Beauty haunts the high country like a majestic hymn, sings in cold sunny air, the brilliant mountain air<U+2014>makes of sunlight a living thing<U+2014>floats in cloud forms<U+2014>filters changing floods of light ever clothing the mountains anew.

In 1961, a 12,362-foot (3768 meter) High Sierra peak was officially named Mount Cedric Wright ({{coord|36|54|13.9|N|118|23|15.2|W|display=inline}}), in memory of Wright, who was described as an "internationally known photographer whose photography has made a significant contribution to the appreciation of the natural scene."

A 2011 exhibit at the [[Chadwick School]] featured photos of the school by both Wright and Adams. Two of Wright's children had attended the school. A critic writing for the [[Los Angeles Times]] praised Wright's work: "In the Chadwick exhibition, it's Wright who trumps Adams with the show's most jaw-dropping image: a 1947 shot of five boys playing basketball on the school's outdoor court, against a backdrop of rolling hills and the Los Angeles Basin far below.
