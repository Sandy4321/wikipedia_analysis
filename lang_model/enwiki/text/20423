'''Fort McHenry''', in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], is a [[star fort]] best known for its role in the [[War of 1812]], when it successfully defended [[Inner Harbor|Baltimore Harbor]] from an attack by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Royal Navy|navy]] in [[Chesapeake Bay]]. It was during this bombardment of the fort that [[Francis Scott Key]] was inspired to write [[The Star-Spangled Banner]], the poem that would eventually be turned into the [[national anthem]] of the [[United States]].

Named after [[James McHenry]], a [[Scotch-Irish]] immigrant and surgeon-soldier who became Secretary of War under President Washington, Fort McHenry was built to defend the important port of Baltimore from future enemy attacks, after America won its independence.  It was positioned on the [[Locust Point]] peninsula which juts into the opening of Baltimore Harbor, and was constructed in the form of a five-pointed star surrounded by a ''dry moat''.  The moat would serve as a shelter from which musketmen might defend the fort from a land attack.  In case such a siege penetrated this first line of defense, each point, or ''bastion'', was fortified, so that the invading army would be caught in a pincer of cannon and musket fire.

The only attack the fort ever received came during the [[War of 1812]] in the naval portion of the [[Battle of Baltimore]].  Beginning at dawn on [[September 13]], [[1814]], British warships continuously bombarded the fort for 25 hours under heavy rain. The American defenders had 18, 24, and 38 pound (8, 11 and 17 kg) cannons with a range of 1.5 miles (2.4 km). The British mortars had a range of 2 miles (3 km), and their [[Congreve rocket|rockets]] had a 1.75 mile (2.8 km) range; however they were not very accurate.  The British ships were unable to pass Fort McHenry and penetrate [[Inner Harbor|Baltimore Harbor]] because of defenses including a chain, sunken ships, and the American cannon; but they were able to come close enough to fire rockets and mortars on the fort.  Due to the poor accuracy of the British weapons and the limited range of the American guns, little damage was done on either side, but the British ceased their attack on the morning of [[September 14]], [[1814]], and the naval part of the British invasion of Baltimore had been repulsed.

The Americans did suffer casualties, amounting to four killed and 24 wounded, including one African American soldier and a woman who was cut in half by a bomb as she carried supplies to the troops. At one point during the bombardment a bomb crashed through the powder magazine. Fortunately for the defenders, either the fuse was extinguished by the rain or the bomb was merely a dud. 

[[Francis Scott Key]], a Washington lawyer who had come to Baltimore to negotiate the release of a civilian prisoner of war, [[Dr Beanes]] witnessed the bombardment from a nearby truce ship. An oversized American flag had been sewn by [[Mary Pickersgill]] in anticipation of the British attack on the fort.  When Key saw the flag emerge intact in the dawn of September 14, he was so moved that he began that very morning to compose the poem "The Defense of Fort McHenry" which would be renamed "[[The Star Spangled Banner]]" and become America's [[national anthem]].

==Functions and services==

Fort McHenry served as the primary defense for the port of Baltimore until about 1848, when [[Fort Carroll]] was constructed further down the [[Patapsco River]].

During the [[American Civil War]], Fort McHenry served as a military prison, confining both Confederate soldiers as well as a large number of Maryland political figures who were suspected of being Confederate sympathizers.  Ironically, Francis Scott Key's grandson was one of these political detainees.  In an earlier coincidence, James McHenry's son had served in the defense of the fort during the Battle of Baltimore.

During [[World War I]], an additional hundred-odd buildings were built on the land surrounding the fort in order to convert the entire facility into an enormous hospital for the treatment of troops returning from the European conflict.  Virtually none of these buildings remain, while the original fort has been preserved and restored to essentially its condition during the War of 1812.

During [[World War II]] Fort McHenry served as a Coast Guard base, helping to defend the port of Baltimore.

==Years as a national monument==

The fort was made a [[national park]] in 1925; on [[August 11]], [[1939]] it was redesignated a "[[U.S. National Monument|National Monument]] and Historic Shrine," the only such doubly designated place in the United States.  It was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on [[October 15]], [[1966]].  It has become national tradition that when a new flag is designed it first flies over Fort McHenry. The first official 49 and 50 star American flags were flown over the fort and are still located on the premises.

The Fort has become a vital center of recreation for the Baltimore locals as well as a prominent tourist destination. Thousands of visitors come each year to see the "Birthplace of the Star Spangled Banner."

Every September the City of Baltimore commemorates [[Defenders Day]] in honor of the Battle of Baltimore. It is the biggest celebration of the year at the Fort, accompanied by a weekend of programs, events, and fireworks. 

In 2005 the [[Living History]] volunteer unit, the [[Fort McHenry Guard]] was awarded the George B. Hartzog award for serving the National Park Service as the best volunteer unit. Among the members of the unit is [[Martin J. O'Malley|Martin O'Malley]], the mayor of Baltimore, who was made the unit's honorary colonel in 2003. 

The flag that flew over Fort McHenry, the [[Star Spangled Banner Flag]] is currently undergoing restoration at the [[Smithsonian]] [[National Museum of American History]]. It is in extremely fragile condition but hopefully will be finished by 2007. The public is welcome to come to the museum and observe the restoration process of this national treasure.
