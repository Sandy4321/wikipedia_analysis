"'''Naughty Girl'''" is an [[contemporary R&B|R&B]]-[[disco]] song written by [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]], [[Scott Storch]], Robert Waller and [[Angela Beyinc<U+00E9>]] for Beyonc<U+00E9>'s debut solo album, ''[[Dangerously in Love]]'' (2003). Produced by Beyonc<U+00E9> and Storch, the song lives up to the Western sound of its predecessor "[[Baby Boy (Beyonc<U+00E9> song)|Baby Boy]]". Along with its several awards garnered, the song received positive responses from critics, citing its sensual content.

The single was released as the fourth and final [[single (music)|single]] from the album early in 2004. Though it failed to match the success of "[[Crazy in Love (Beyonc<U+00E9> song)|Crazy in Love]]" and "Baby Boy", only reaching number three on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], the single had immediate success which helped the album propel on charts. The single received similar responses from international music markets, entering mostly top twenty.

The single's music video features Beyonc<U+00E9> flirtatiously and seductively dances with [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] singer [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] to portray a naughty girl. The video gained her additional award.

==Background and composition==
After the release of her former group [[Destiny's Child]]'s 2001 album ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'', Beyonc<U+00E9> tried on solo career and worked for her debut solo album, ''[[Dangerously in Love]]''. Beyonc<U+00E9> stated that it is more personal than her previous records because she only had to write for herself.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Beyonc<U+00E9>'s debut Album, Dangerously In Love, |url=http://www.thread.co.nz/article/554 |work=Thread |publisher=Thread Ltd. |accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref> She contacted various musical collaborators; including Scott Storch, who had produced hits for [[Christina Aguilera]], Robert Waller and her cousin-songwriter-personal assistant [[Angela Beyinc<U+00E9>]]. Storch and Beyonc<U+00E9> [[sampling (music)|sampled]] the refrain of the 1975 song "[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby]]", originally performed by [[Donna Summer]] and written by Summer, [[Pete Bellotte]] and [[Giorgio Moroder]].

==Release and reception==
<!--"Naughty Girl" was originally supposed to be the first single from ''Dangerously in Love''. The song was deemed not to have potential to fail but, at the same time, not to become a big hit. The plan was to push back when "[[Crazy in Love (Beyonc<U+00E9> song)|Crazy in Love]]" was chosen as the first single. (For now, I will hide this. It will be shown again when I can confirmed this really happened. Finding for sources. -->

The [[music video|video]] for "Naughty Girl" was directed by [[Jake Nava]],<ref name="Patel"/> who directed Beyonc<U+00E9>'s first two videos, "Crazy in Love" and "Baby Boy".

The video begins with Beyonc<U+00E9> performing a simple dance routine surrounded by a wall of mirrors and then behind a white curtain, revealing only her silhouette. Beyonc<U+00E9> enters the club with a different outfit and hairstyle, and with a few of her friends; she and Usher notice each other. The two meet on the dance floor and dance intimately, before Beyonc<U+00E9> performs an elaborate dance scene with female backing dancers. She swirls around in a larger-than-life [[champagne (wine)|champagne]] glass filled with bubbles (<U+00E0> la [[Josephine Baker]]). In the final scene, Beyonc<U+00E9> sits atop a piano, and after being lifted down by a gentleman, she dances and poses as confetti falls everywhere.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Reid |first=Shaheem |title=Usher Says He's Not A Baby's Daddy |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1485933/20040323/usher.jhtml |work=MTV News |publisher=MTV Networks |date([[March 23]], [[2004]]) |accessdate=2008-03-04}}</ref>
