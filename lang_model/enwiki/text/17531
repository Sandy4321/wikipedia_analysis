'''Gulfton''' is a community in [[Southwest Houston|Southwest]] [[Houston]], [[Texas]], [[United States]]<ref>"[http://www.gswhcc.org/custom2.asp?pageid=137 Welcome to Southwest Houston!]." Greater Southwest Houston Chamber of Commerce. Retrieved on December 13, 2008.</ref> that includes a {{convert|3.2|sqmi|km2|1|abbr=on}} group of apartment complexes that primarily house Hispanic and immigrant populations. It is located between the [[610 Loop]] and [[Beltway 8]], west of the City of [[Bellaire]], southeast of [[U.S. Highway 59 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 59]], and north of [[Bellaire Boulevard]].  <!--add a map to the article and lose these descriptors to improve clarity-->

In the 1960s and 1970s Gulfton experienced rapid development, with new apartment complexes built for young individuals from the Northeast and Midwest United States. They came to work in the oil industry during the [[1970s Energy Crisis#.22Oil Patch.22|1970s oil boom]].

In the 1980s, as the [[1980s oil glut|economy declined]], existing tenants left, resulting in significant drop in occupancy rates in the apartment complexes and forcing many complexes into bankruptcy and foreclosure. Owners marketed the empty units to newly-arrived immigrants and Gulfton became a predominantly immigrant community.<ref name="USDOJTruancySuccess">"[http://web.archive.org/web/20050305112100/http://ojjdp.ncjrs.org/truancy/success_1.html Success Stories]."

Retrieved on April 5, 2008.</ref> Beginning in the 1980s Gulfton's crime rate increased and schools were increasingly overwhelmed with excess students.<!--Cited below--> "Houstonians" (Houston citizens) nicknamed the community the "Gulfton Ghetto."<!--Cited in a later section--> The city of Houston responded to the sudden demographic shifts by increasing police presence, and the school district responded by opening more schools to handle the influx of students. After the 1980s demographic and socioeconomic transitions, Gulfton gained a community college campus, two additional elementary schools, added public bus routes, a park, a community center, a public library, and a juvenile detention facility.

By 2000 Gulfton was the most densely populated community in Houston, with 71 percent Hispanic residents, including many recent immigrants from [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]].

He was referring to the shift in the demographics of various apartment complexes. Goodner said that the complex owners were unconcerned about this development as long as the rent payments were made. Landlords had difficulty filling apartment complexes even if they did not require background checks. Many banks and lending institutions owned foreclosed apartments and failed to properly maintain them, considering it "pouring money down a perceived rat hole."<ref name="Drugsneglectslums"/> Gaines added that many complexes deferred maintenance.<ref name="Drugsneglectslums"/>

Many of the new Gulfton residents found limited access to government services such as [[food stamp]]s and municipal and county health care. By July 1989, the Gulfton area was designated by Houston's city council as a "Community Development Target." These provided low income communities with increased city services supplemented with federal funding. This drew a response from the Houston Resident Citizens Participation Council (HRCPC), a citizen commission that monitored funding for low income residents. Board members formally protested city council against diverting support funds from the "old poor" in existing low income areas to the "new poor" in newly created communities.<ref name="Newpoor">Cobb, Kim.

In 1985, recent Salvadoran immigrants opened the Central American Refugee Center (CARECEN) to provide legal services for central American immigrants.

In the late 1980s, the Southwest Houston Task Force was established as a coalition of representatives from the City of Houston government, health and human services organizations, businesses, schools, religious organizations, and Gulfton-area residents.  The Task Force held two meetings related to the proposal for the establishment of a municipal health clinic in Gulfton.<ref name="PublicLifeGulfton44"/> The organization's meetings led to the opening in 1991 of the ''Sisters of Charity Southwest Health Clinic'', the Gulfton area's first major health clinic. Jointly operated by the GAAC and the City of Houston, the clinic provided pre-natal and child care services. Fisher and Taafe state that the organization "lost its focal issue" after the clinic opened. After performing a "community needs assessment" and identifying "local leaders", the organization disbanded in early 1992.<ref>Fisher, Robert and Lisa Taafe.

After the [[1980s oil glut|1980s economic decline]] and changes in the local demographics, crime increased in Gulfton. By 1988, many Houstonians referred to the neighborhood as the ''Gulfton Ghetto''.

After the demographics changed, [[Gangs in the United States|youth street gang]]s appeared in Gulfton. As of 2006 the Gulfton area has gangs such as "Southwest Cholos," "La Primera," "La Tercera Crips," "Somos Pocos Pero Locos," and "[[Mara Salvatrucha]]" (MS-13). Charles Rotramel, the director of a nonprofit group called "Youth Advocates," said that Gulfton's dense conditions, lack of features intended for children, and lack of recreational and athletic programs helped form the gang cultures. He added that other factors included fathers being absent, including many who were imprisoned, and mothers who had issues like drug and alcohol addictions or mothers who worked for jobs with very lengthy working hours.<ref name="Hollandsworth172Dark"/> In 1993, a the "Southwest Cholos" began to appear in Gulfton.

Rose Mary Garza, the principal of Benavidez Elementary School in 1995, stated that she hated hearing the term "Gulfton Ghetto," which was still in common use at the time, as the community was trying to move away from that stereotype. Crime rates in Gulfton decreased that year and Captain Charles Bullock, commander of the Southwest Patrol on Beechnut Street said that an increased police presence caused the crime rates to decrease.<ref name="Dignity"/>

In the 1990s City of Houston officials started the "Weed and Seed" program, where funds would be used to replace criminal activity with positive community activities. The City of Houston spent $800,000 in five years on Gulfton. Items funded through "Weed and Seed" included "United Minds," a leadership program for teenagers, the Las Am<U+00E9>ricas Education Center built on the Las Am<U+00E9>ricas Apartments property, the Gulfton Community Learning Center, and a [[computer lab]] at an area park.

By the 1997<U+2013>1998 school year, 75% of Gulfton students qualified for free or reduced-price lunches. Almost 95% of Gulfton students were classified as economically disadvantaged, almost double the Texas rate. More than 70% of Gulfton students exhibited a lack of [[English as a foreign or second language|English language proficiency]], while 27.6% of Houston ISD students and 13.4% of Texas residents exhibited this level of deficiency. Susana Herrera, the program coordinator for Houston's Truancy Reduction Demonstration Project, said that truancy was a major issue in Gulfton education and language barriers, a lack of supervision by parents and guardians, "high mobility," lack of familiarity with United States laws, and familial norms act as "barriers to attending school."<ref name="HerreraEngagement"/><ref>"[http://www.socialwork.msu.edu/about/newsletters/fall05.pdf Fall 2005 News]."
