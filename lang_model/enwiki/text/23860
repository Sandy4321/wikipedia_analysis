The '''Rep<U+00FA>blica Croma<U+00F1><U+00F3>n nightclub fire''' occurred in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] on 30 December 2004, and killed 194 people.<ref name="7 Members"> {{cite news  | url=  http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/world/americas/21briefs-7MEMBERSOFBA_BRF.html?_r=1| title=  Argentina: 7 Members of Band Convicted in Club Fire| publisher=  [[nytimes.com]]| date=  April 20, 2011 | accessdate= 2012}} </ref> The tragedy was symbolic of [[government of Argentina|government]] failure in Argentina, since the club had received a permit despite lacking basic [[fire safety]] measures like [[fire extinguisher]]s.<ref name="7 Members" />

==Fire==
The venue was hosting [[rock and roll|rock]] group [[Callejeros]] and around 3,000 people were in attendance.  The blaze was started when a [[flare (pyrotechnic)|pyrotechnic flare]] (a popular device in [[New Year's Eve]] celebrations) was set off and ignited foam in the ceiling. The materials used in the building for decoration were flammable: mostly [[wood]], [[styrofoam]], acoustic panels and a plastic net (a so-called ''media sombra'').  This plastic net was hung from the ceiling and caught fire first, melting into a rain of fire. In some parts of the building, teddy bear stuffing was used as a cheap alternative to wool fiber. The owner and the band's lead singer had told the patrons not to use flares inside the building.

Four of the six doors, some of which were [[fire exit]]s, were chained shut so that "people would not enter without paying", according to [[Mayor]] [[An<U+00ED>bal Ibarra]]. Most of the victims died from [[smoke inhalation|inhaling]] poisonous gases, and [[carbon monoxide]].

==Aftermath==
Following the disaster, an Argentine judge issued a national and international arrest order against [[Omar Chab<U+00E1>n]], local businessman and owner of Rep<U+00FA>blica Croma<U+00F1><U+00F3>n and other nightclubs, including one called Cemento that had been closed by court orders many times before. Chab<U+00E1>n was located at one of his houses in the neighbourhood of [[Montserrat, Buenos Aires|Montserrat]] and was arrested. 

Police are still seeking those responsible for setting off the flare.  If they are found (some reports say they have already been identified and that they are children{{cn|date=January 2013}}), then they could face eight to twenty years in [[prison]].

[[President of Argentina|President]] [[N<U+00E9>stor Kirchner]] decreed three days of [[national mourning]], and city authorities forbade concerts and closed all nightclubs in [[Buenos Aires]] during the mourning period.

==Investigation==
It later became known that Rep<U+00FA>blica Croma<U+00F1><U+00F3>n was overdue for a fire hazard inspection since late November 2004. Although Mayor Ibarra blamed the Fire Department of the [[Polic<U+00ED>a Federal Argentina|Argentine Federal Police]] (responsible for the inspections), several flaws in the city's inspection system surfaced. Coupled with the city's poor capability to handle a disaster of this magnitude, critics pointed to Ibarra for failing to reorganize Buenos Aires' inspection system. A few days after the fire, Ibarra reshuffled the entire Buenos Aires security and emergency administration. The City Legislature announced that Mayor Ibarra was going to face a questioning session. However, the Legislature failed to achieve the necessary votes to question Ibarra. Shortly after, Ibarra voluntarily submitted to a questioning session, and announced a recall referendum to decide whether he would remain in office or not.

Relatives and friends of the dead organized several marches to [[Plaza de Mayo]] demanding the resignation of [[An<U+00ED>bal Ibarra]] as Mayor of Buenos Aires, the conviction of Omar Chab<U+00E1>n and more efficiency in the inspection system. Some of these marches ended with incidents between protesters and the police.

On 14 November 2005, an [[impeachment]] jury formed by a commission of the Buenos Aires Legislature suspended Mayor Ibarra for four months, pending investigation of his performance that could lead to his destitution. He has accused the opposition of manipulating the families of Rep<U+00FA>blica Croma<U+00F1><U+00F3>n's victims in order to ruin his career. On 7 March 2006, after four months of deliberations, the impeachment jury voted to remove Ibarra from office.

==Trial==
A trial started on 19 August 2008 and  finished 1 year later. The defendants were sentenced as follows:
*[[Omar Chab<U+00E1>n]]: 20-year prison sentence
*Ra<U+00FA>l Villarreal: 1-year suspended prison sentence
*[[Callejeros]]: Acquitted, then retried in 2011: 11-year prison sentence
*Diego Arga<U+00F1>araz (manager of Callejeros): 18-year prison sentence
*Fabiana Fiszbin (ex Control secretary): 2-year prison sentence
*Ana Mar<U+00ED>a Fern<U+00E1>ndez (ex Buenos Aires government servant): 2-year prison sentence
*Subcommissioner Carlos D<U+00ED>az: 18-year prison sentence
*Commissioner Miguel Belay: acquitted
