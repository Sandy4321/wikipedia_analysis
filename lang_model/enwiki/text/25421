'''Byne's disease''', more accurately known as '''Bynesian decay''', is a peculiar and permanently damaging condition (resulting from an on-going [[chemical reaction]]) which often attacks [[mollusk shell]]s that are in storage or on display for long periods of time.<ref name="Sally2">Shelton, S.Y. (1996). [http://s190418054.onlinehome.us/portal/1999/9908mon.pdf "The Shell Game: Mollusks Shell Deterioration in Collections and its Prevention"]. ''The Festivus'' '''XXVIII'''(7): 74-80.</ref>

Bynesian decay is a form of [[efflorescence]] of [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] formed by the reaction of [[acid]]ic vapors with the [[base (chemistry)|basic]] shell surface. This can superficially resemble a growth of [[mold]]. Although first described in the early [[19th century]], Bynesian decay was not well understood until almost a hundred years later. The condition is named after the man (L. Byne) who is best known for describing it in the late 19th century, even though he was not the first person to describe it in print. In addition, Byne mistakenly assumed that the condition was caused by [[bacteria]], and thus the condition came to be referred to as a "disease". 

In addition to mollusk shells, various other [[natural history]] [[specimen]]s are susceptible to this form of decay, including [[eggshell]]s<ref>Ryhl-Svendsen, M. (2001).[http://iaq.dk/image/eggshell.htm ''Bynes efflorescence on an egg shell'']. IAQ in Museums and Archives.</ref> and some [[fossil]]s and [[mineral]] samples that are composed of [[calcium carbonate]]. This condition is of concern for [[museum]] scientists, and also for anyone who has a private collection of specimens of these kinds.

==Appearance==
[[File: Bynesian Decay 001.JPG|thumb|Some affected mollusk shells. The efflorecence is clearly visible in both specimens. This decay was deliberately produced under extreme conditions.]]

Byne's disease can appear as a powdery white coating on a shell. It also often looks as if a shell has been "infected" with [[mold]]; under magnification however the mold-like appearance is revealed to be a crystalline growth of salts.

==History==
In 1839, the [[British people|British]] [[naturalist]] and [[malacologist]] [[Thomas Brown (naturalist)|Thomas Brown]] (1785-1862) briefly mentioned this form of deterioration in his book ''A Conchologist's Text-Book''.<ref name="Sally2"/> Agnes Kenyon also described the condition in 1896, suggesting that "saline particles in the [[atmosphere]] [were] evidently exerting a [[corrosive]] effect".<ref name="Sally2"/>

;Origin of the name

In 1899, the British amateur [[conchology|conchologist]] and [[naturalist]] Loftus St. George Byne (1872-1947)<ref>Salisbury A. E. (21 Septemeber 1951) "Obituaries: Ronald Winckworth, 1884<U+2013>1950". ''Proceedings of the malacological Socety of London'' '''29'''(1951-1953, Part I): [http://mollus.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/29/1/5 5]-6.</ref> described this condition,<ref name=''Callomon''>Callomon, P. [http://www.conchologistsofamerica.org/articles/y2002/0209_callomon.asp'''Byne<U+2019>s Disease <U+2013> Questions and Answers'''].</ref> in a presentation to the [[Conchological Society of Great Britain]] in Ireland, and did so again in another presentation in June of that same year.<ref name="Sally2"/>

{{cquote|1=
...a dullness first pervading the exterior of certain smooth species more markedly e.g. ''[[Conus]]'', ''[[Cypraea]]'', and especially [[Naticidae]]. Then grey acid efflorescence, both tasting and smelling strongly of [[vinegar]] covers the whole surface like a powder, rising doubtless from the interior, and the specimens are soon almost irretrievably ruined.}}

Byne was convinced that [[butyric acid]] was present together with [[calcium acetate]] in the affected shells, although he never really described the methods he used in the so-called "extensive chemical tests" he applied to these [[specimen]]s. Among other conclusions, he assumed that the butyric acid originated from [[bacteria]]l activity. He also concluded that the decaying effect 'travelled from shell to shell and drawer to drawer',<ref>Byne, L. St G., (1899) "The corrosion of shells in cabinets". ''Journal of Conchology'' '''9''': 172<U+2013>178.</ref> and thus the condition came to be called a "disease".

;Clarification and resolution

The true nature of the "disease" was finally clarified in 1934, when the [[British government]] [[chemist]] John Ralph Nicholls explained that oak cabinets at the [[Natural History Museum]] in London were giving off acetic acid fumes which were attacking the shells stored in them.<ref name="Sally2"/>

In 1985, almost 150 years after the Byne's disease was first mentioned in the literature, Norman H. Tennent and Thomas Baird published an extensive study on the subject. Their deep analysis, involving many complex and sophisticated techniques such as [[X-Ray diffraction]], [[infrared spectroscopy]], [[thermogravimetric analysis]] and [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]], finally revealed the true nature of the decaying process. They identified the substances involved (the [[calcium]] salts), as well as the [[chemical reaction]]s that originated them. They finally concluded that Byne's disease is not actually a disease, and is in fact caused by simple chemical reactions which occur in the presence of acidic vapors originated from the very environment the specimens were stored in.<ref name="Tennent">Tennent, N.H. and Baird, T. (1985): "The Deterioration of Mollusca Collections: Identification of Shell Efflorescence". ''Studies in Conservation'' '''30''': 73-85.</ref>

==Chemistry==
Bynesian decay usually starts when specimens are stored or displayed for considerable periods of time in an enclosed space. The storage method itself can directly cause this problem, when containers, cabinets or [[display case]]s are entirely or partially made of [[wood]], [[plywood]] or other wood products such as [[Masonite]], or when the specimens are surrounded by, or in contact with, various other kinds of materials that are [[cellulose]]-based and can turn water vapor [[acid]]ic.<ref name="Sturm"/><ref name="Sally Byne's"/> 

Other potentially damaging materials include non-archival quality [[cardboard]], card, [[paper]], [[cotton]] and [[cork]], all of which give off acidic vapors over time. [[PVC]] and [[polyurethane]] plastics are also a problem, as they degrade and give off acidic vapors with time.<ref name="Sturm"/> High [[humidity]] of the air is a significant contributing factor, as is lack of ventilation of the specimens. High ambient temperatures can increase the rapidity of the decay.<ref name="Sally Byne's"/> 

Generally, in cabinets or display cases entirely or partially made of wood, the [[hydrolysis]] of [[acetyl]] groups in the wood [[hemicellulose]]s creates [[acetic acid]], in a rate that is proportional to the concentration of [[esters]] in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment.<ref name="Berndt"> Berndt, H. (1987). [http://www.wag-aic.org/1987/berndt87.pdf "Assessing the Detrimental Effects of Wood and Wood Products on the Environment Inside Display Cases"]. AIC, Vancouver, BC.</ref> [[Formaldehyde]] can also occur in wood, being formed by a degradation reaction of [[lignin]]. It can also stem from ubiquitous [[formaldehyde]] [[resins]] (commonly urea-formaldehyde resins).<ref name="Berndt"/> 
In the first case, acetic acid reacts with the calcium carbonate (one of the main components of freshwater and marine shells, birds' eggs and other such specimens) producing [[calcium acetate]], a salt. [[Formaldehyde]] can be oxidized by the oxygen in air to create [[formic acid]], which then has basically the same effects as [[acetic acid]], reacting with calcium carbonate to produce a salt. The salts ([[calcium acetate]] and [[calcium formate]]) crystallize through the specimen's outer surface, destroying its fine detail and exposing more areas for further reaction. As the condition progresses, the salt crystals build up over the specimen's surface, which becomes increasingly eroded.<ref name="Sally Byne's">Shelton, S.Y. (2008).

The calcium carbonate and acetic acid chemical reaction occurs as follows<ref name="Brokerhof"> Brokerhof, A. (1999).

Calcium carbonate and formic acid chemical reaction occurs as follows<ref>Baltrusaitis, J., Usher, C. and Grassian, V. (2006): "Reactivity of Formic Acid on Calcium Carbonate Single Particle and Single Crystal Surfaces: Effect of Adsorbed Water". ''Microscopy and Microanalysis'' '''12'''(Suppl 2): 796-797.

Calcium carbonate and sulfuric acid chemical reaction occurs as follows<ref>Casiday, R. and Frey, R.

In this last reaction, calcium carbonate reacts with [[sulfuric acid]] and produce calcium sulfate, water and carbon dioxide.

==Prevention==
When specimens are to be placed in any size of container for long-term storage or display, the consistent use of only archival-quality materials prevents the development of Byne's disease. Thus, materials such as metal cabinets and display cases, archival quality paper labels and card trays are used in museum collections of specimens that might be vulnerable to this reaction.<ref name="Sturm"/><ref name="Sally Byne's"/> 

It is also worth mentioning that sea shells, after collecting, need to be washed thoroughly in freshwater to remove the salt that is on and in the shell, and then dried thoroughly before they are stored. Salt attracts moisture and makes shells more vulnerable to Bynesian decay.

The following is a chart that shows non-archival materials and their archival equivalents:

If possible, the use of wood and [[cellulose]] derivatives should be avoided. Many [[varnish]]es and [[paint]]s are well known emitters of [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs)<ref name="T<U+00E9>trault">{{cite journal|last=T<U+00E9>trault|first=J.|coauthors=Stamatopoulou, E.|date=1997|title=Determination of Concentrations of Acetic Acid Emitted from Wood Coatings in Enclosures|journal=Studies in Conservation|volume=42|issue=3|pages=141-156}}</ref>, some of which may be acidic and have the potential to damage calcium carbonate specimens. Because of this, these [[coating]]s should also be avoided; water-based varnishes and paints are considered less harmful and should be preferred.<ref name="Sturm">{{cite book|last=Sturm|first=C. F.|coauthors=Pearce, T.A. & Vald<U+00E9>s, A.|title=The Mollusks: A Guide to their Study, Collection, and Preservation|publisher=Universal Publishers|date=2006|pages=45-57|chapter=Archival and Curatorial Methods|isbn=1-58112-930-0}}</ref> 

Because the reactions involved in Bynesian decay require a certain quantity of [[moisture]] in the air to take place, keeping the environmental [[relative humidity]] under control is beneficial. This is achieved by careful monitoring of the relative humidity (using instruments such as a [[hygrometer]]), and applying [[dehumidifiers]] when necessary; sometimes, simple [[air conditioning]] systems may suffice. Extremely low humidity can damage some specimens, so caution is recommended. Usually, a relative humidity maintained around 50% is considered to be adequate.<ref name="Sally Byne's"/><ref name="Sturm"/> Applying [[sorbent]]s containing a [[strong base]], such as [[potassium hydroxide]], inside the storage environment to protect the specimens against degradation is also possible. Copy paper or KOH-impregnated [[filter paper]] are some low cost examples of sorbents which can be used. These strong bases have a preference to react with acid, thus they compete successfully with the calcium carbonate specimens for any acidic vapors that may be present. The bases also help reduce the overall acid [[concentration]] inside the enclosed space.<ref name="Brokerhof"/>

==Management==
The damage to specimens is unfortunately not reversible; however, the decay can be arrested by washing or soaking the specimens in water, followed by a very thorough drying. The specimens must then be placed in an environment that consists of only archival materials, in a completely archival setting.

==Pyrite disease==
In collections which contain [[fossils]], high humidity can also affect [[pyrite]] (iron sulphide) fossils in a somewhat similar condition, which is known as [[Pyrite Disease]]. The [[iron sulfide]] can react with water and oxygen to form [[iron sulfate]]s and [[sulfuric acid]], which then can produce Bynesian decay. <ref name="Sturm"/>
