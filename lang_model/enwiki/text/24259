'''Harry Bowly Hollins''' ([[1854]] &ndash; [[February 24]], [[1938]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[financier]], [[bank]]er, and [[railroad|railroad magnate]]. He was responsible for organizing the banking and brokerage firm bearing his name, '''H.B. Hollins & Co.''' in [[1878]].

==Life & Business==
He was born to [[Francis Hollins]] and Elizabeth Coles Morris. Hollins, a native New Yorker educated in private schools was married to socialite Evelina Merseole Knapp. The couple had four sons, McKim, John K., Gerald V. and Harry B., and a daughter, Marion. Colloquially known as '''Harry B. Hollins''' or '''H. B. Hollins''', Henry was notable in New York society life. Members of the Hollins family were such prominent figures that their social affairs were listed in the [[New York Times]]' social diary. 

Hollins resided between Manhattan at his multiple town residences and at his 600-acre country estate, Meadow Farm in [[East Islip, New York|East Islip, Long Island]]. Hollins entertained family and friends at Meadow Farm each summer and early autumn; one famous guest to summer at the estate was Hollin's friend, [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|HRH The Prince of Wales]].  Meadow Farm is also believed to be the birthplace of his children. His family's residences, mainly the East Islip mansion were said to contain many valuable paintings and rare objects of art.

Hollins began business as a [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[insurance broker]], and became a banker in [[1888]]. At one time he was a partner of Fernando Yznaga, whose sister was the Dowager Duchess of Manchester. In fact, he was along with close friend [[William Kissam Vanderbilt|William K. Vanderbilt]], the executors of Yznaga's will. Along with [[Eugene Zimmerman]] of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], the father of the Duchess of Manchester, had owned an interest in a number of properties in the MidWest. These properties included Superior Colliery Company and Superior Development Company.

[[J. P. Morgan]] and H. B. Hollins were also business partners and the closest of friends until the former's death. In fact Morgan's offices were located across the street from '''H. B. Hollins & Co.''''s exclusive banking offices, at the southwest corner of Wall and Broad Streets. On [[November 13]] [[1913]], '''H.B. Hollins & Co.''', one of [[Wall Street|Wall Street's]] most highly regarded houses failed in debt of $5,000,000. The failure of the house was related to a number of issues including the Company letting their Stock Exchange business go adrift, paying more attention to floatation of new companies and to banking operations in addition to their expenses boring them down. After the news of the firm failure had spread through the financial district, Hollin's attorney's [[Beekman, Menken & Griscom]] released a press statement downplaying the collapse:

<i>"The failure was due to withdrawal of large deposits, thus greatly reducing the firm's working capital, which is largely invested in securities which cannot be readily sold in the present market."</i>

A large portion of the securities was understood on the Street to represent a number of companies in Mexico that were adversely impacted by political turmoil south of the border at the time. These enterprises were thought to include Mexican Crude Oil, Asphaltic Products Company, and United States Asphalt Company. Harry B. Hollins belonged to the Union Metropolitan, [[South Side Sportmen|South Side Sportmen's]], Knickerbocker, New York Yacht, Meadow Brook, Racquet and Tennis, Riding, and Garden City Golf Clubs, also the Automobile Club of America.

After Hollins' bankruptcy Meadow Farm, the country manor was sold to [[Charles L. Lawrance]] along with 116-acres bordering the [[Great South Bay]] and [[Champlin Creek]].  The family rennovated one of the farmhouses on the northern portion of the approximately 480 acres remaining to which they relocated to.  After the death of Mrs. H. B. Hollins, a month after her husband, her daughter Marion as the admistratrix of the estate sold most of the property not utilized by the family.  Meadow Farm was sadly demolished in 2002/03 as part of the Harbor View project. This project was completion of [[The Moorings]], a wealthy [[gated community]] by the subdividing Meadow Farm's remaining 16-acres into 11 lots.  The purchaser of the 5.88-acre parcel (now 150 Meadowfarm Road) containing Meadow Farm learned the cost of refurbishing the mansion would have well exceeded $1 million and opted to replace it with a newer estate.  According to a New York Times article written in 1999, the new estate's owner planned to salvage marble fireplaces, paneling and other appurtenances from the mansion.  
 
Remnants of Hollins' Meadow Farm can still be found off of Dock Road including the original gates now leading to a small community named after the family, Hollins Estates.  The story often repeated by people in the area was that the brick walls supporting the gates were built by masons brought over from Italy with bricks imported from England.  During road construction/excavating for the South West Sewer District in the late 1970's, the granite latch keep for the gates was unearthed and deposited on the property of a nearby homeowner (EP Brown).  Burned into the side of the stone were the words "HB Hollins, Islip, LI" - apparently the delivery address inscribed by the stonecutter in the late 1870's.   The once private road leading to the manor house was named Hollins Lane.  The Hollins' stable and clocktower remains as a residential house at 37 Blackmore Lane.  Local lore has it that this building, while houseing horse stalls and a tack room on the east side, was built as a cow barn.  This may hold true as a weather vane in the shape of a cow once stood atop the clock tower.  The weathervane, along with the clock's works, were stolen in the late 1970's.  Sadly, a carriage house, located west of Meadowfarm Road and last used as a residence, was demolished in the late 1980's to make way for a subdivision.  At 35 Blackmore lane is what was believed to have been the estate manager's (Blackmore) house, which had been moved from another location nearby.  At 42 Blackmore Lane is a structure on a 5-acre parcel which also belonged to Hollins.  It was the rennovated farmhouse they relocated to after parting with Meadowfarm.  Harvard Class books from the 1930's were found in the house in the 1980's - a member of the Hollins family was pictured in those books.  Walt Whitman's uncle may have been the original owner of this farm house.  A company, Yarmouth Estate of [[Bay Shore, New York]] unfortunately has purchased the house at 42 Blackmore and is requesting a subdivision.  Harry Hollins Jr.'s estate house, designed by the architechtural firm of Cross & Cross and built in 1907, remains at 18 Crick Holly Lane and Gerald Hollins' home remains at 180 Bayview Avenue.  The carriage house for Gerard Hollins' house still stands at 158 Bayview Ave and is now used as a private residence.  Gerald Hollins later built a home on White Oak Lane, which still stands and is now the visitor's center for the South Shore Nature Center.  Another Hollins' house, that of Robert L. Hollins, stands on the border of Hecksher State Park.  That house is believed to have been one of the earliest houses in the area, originally part of the Nichol farm.  It is now owned by the East Islip School District and is used for special education services.  A private road once ran accross all of the Hollins holdings, crossing Bayview Ave and through the estate of HB Hollins Jr., where it continued into waht is now Hecksher State Park.  The outline of this road can be seen running through the woods on one of the last undeveloped parcels of land off White Oak Lane.  As recently as the 1980's, one area resident was concerned as the road was still listed as a legal right-of-way in his property deed.  The town has named several things in the family's honor. Most notable is Hollins Memorial Beach, which the family generously donated to the town.

HB Hollins, along with members of his family, are buried at the Episcopal Church Cemetary in Great River, NY.
