'''Old Bet''' (died July 24, 1816) was either the first or second elephant brought to the United States.<ref name=top>{{cite news |first= Roberta|last= Hershenson|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Under the Big Top  |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E2DD123BF93BA35751C1A9649C8B63 |quote=Old Bet, called ''the second elephant in America'' by the Somers Historical Society, was also one of the most important elephants in America. The [[Elephant Hotel]] in Somers was built in 1825 to honor her, and her owner, [[Hachaliah Bailey]] of Somers, and is now in its third century of circus fame. Old Bet was part of the new tradition of menageries -- elephants, tigers, giraffes, rhinos and other exotic animals imported from abroad -- that traveled the countryside with circuses beginning about 1804. Now an exhibition and a theatrical production recall those early circus days.  |work=[[New York Times]] |date=December 8, 2002 |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}</ref> There are reports of an elephant brought to the United States in 1796, but it is not known for certain that this was the elephant that was later named Old Bet.<ref name=heritage>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1974/3/1974_3_102.shtml |title=Setting The Record Straight On Old Bet. |accessdate=2008-03-21 |quote=It is not an established fact that Old Bet was the first elephant to arrive in America, and quite possibly she was second. An April, 1796, publication, Greenleaf<U+2019>s New York, mentions an elephant journeying to our shores aboard the ship America. A few days later an elephant was exhibited around Beaver Street and Broadway, according to an advertisement in The Argus, April 23, 1796. This area was the location of the Bull<U+2019>s Head Tavern, a place frequented by ships<U+2019> captains, drovers, and a variety of businessmen. Hachaliah Bailey of [[Somers, New York]], regularly stayed at the Bull<U+2019>s Head when he took his cattle to the abattoir, which was located nearby. The newspaper reports that the first elephant was sold to a 'Mister Owen.' Unfortunately, they gave no other information about the man, nor did they tell what he did with the elephant he bought, but Hachaliah Bailey<U+2019>s business partner and brother-in-law was named Owen. |publisher=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]] }}</ref>

==Biography==
The first elephant brought to the United States was in 1796, but it is not know with certainty that this was Old Bet.<ref name=heritage/> The first references to Old Bet start in 1804 in [[Boston]] as part of a [[menagerie]].<ref name=top/> In 1808, while residing in [[Somers, New York]], [[Hachaliah Bailey]] purchased the menagerie elephant for $1,000 and named it "Old Bet".<ref name=roadside>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/pet/oldbet.html |title=Old Bet |accessdate=2010-01-08 |quote= |publisher=[[RoadsideAmerica.com]] }}</ref>

On July 24, 1816, Old Bet was killed while on tour near [[Alfred, Maine]] by a farmer who shot her, and was later convicted of the crime. The farmer thought it was sinful for people to pay to see an animal.<ref name=heritage/><ref name=roadside/>
