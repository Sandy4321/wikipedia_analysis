The migration of Indonesian to Malaysia can be traced back since before the colonial time especially during the [[Srivijaya]] and [[Majapahit]] administration. [[Interracial marriage]]s between Sultanates such as between Sultan [[Mansur Shah of Malacca|Mansur Shah of Srivijaya]] and the
Princess Radin Galah Chandra Kirana of Majapahit are stated in the ''[[Malay Annals]]''.<ref name="hs">{{cite web|url=http://inspirasi.co/books/1374162889.pdf|title=The Politics of Indonesia<U+2013>Malaysia Relations <U+2013> Kinship and Indo-Malay historiography (Kinship and the pre-colonial regional system)|author=Joseph Chinyong Liow|publisher=Routledge, [[Taylor & Francis]]|year=2005|accessdate=19 January 2015|isbn=0-203-67248-8|pages=30|format=[[PDF]]}}</ref> Other historical texts such as ''[[Tuhfat al-Nafis]]'' (known as ''Sejarah Melayu dan Bugis'' (History of
the Malays and Bugis), stated the relations between different Sultanates of [[Johor Sultanate|Johor-Riau]], [[Kedah Sultanate|Kedah]], [[Sultanate of Perak|Perak]], [[Sultanate of Selangor|Selangor]], [[Sultanate of Pahang|Pahang]], and [[Sultanate of Terengganu|Terengganu]] on the peninsula with the east and west coasts of Sumatra and [[Kalimantan]].<ref name="hs"/>

As the British assumed control over the whole territory of the present-day Malaysia during the colonial period, Malaysia was integrated into world commodity and capital markets, became the provider of
resources for its coloniser ([[Suzerainty|suzerain]]) and began to facing the shortage of labour workers.<ref name="lb"/> The British then searching for labour source from countries like [[India]] and [[China]]. The [[Javanese people|Javanese]] then became the third labour source and the British viewed and treated them different from the Indian and Chinese as they were regarded as origination from the [[Ketuanan Melayu|same racial stock]] as the Malays.<ref name="lb"/> A pattern of differential treatment for migrants based on ethnicity was thus established, which was to have major implications for labour migration into [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] after independence in 1957.<ref name="lb"/> The flow of Indonesian migrant workers to the [[West Malaysia]] experienced a sharp increase in the 1930s. The results of the 1950 Malaysian population census indicated that there were 189,450 people born in the Island of Java, 62,200 people originated from [[South Kalimantan]], 26,300 people from [[Sumatra]], 24,000 people from the Island of [[Bawean]] (East Java), and another 7,000 people from [[Sulawesi]].<ref name="lb"/> The movement received a declined following the [[Indonesia<U+2013>Malaysia confrontation|war between the two countries]] but rise again when the relationship been improved. The movement then saw a significant rise in the 1970s following the implementation of the [[Malaysian New Economic Policy|New Economic Policy]] in Malaysia.<ref name="lb"/>
